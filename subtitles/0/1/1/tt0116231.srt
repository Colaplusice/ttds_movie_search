1
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,429
Thirty-five years ago,
a gang of bandits...

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,952
were caught by the gendarme
on Cudi mountain.

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,838
In the course of
these thirty-five years,

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:32,430
illness and prison violence
wiped off all the bandits.

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,276
All but one...

6
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,429
Mother Ceran. Is that you?

7
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,750
Yeah. Who are you?

8
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,678
It's Baran.

9
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,156
Baran. The Bandit, you are back?

10
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,916
I'm back Mother Ceran. What
happened to the village?

11
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,832
The water came. Covered everything.
They said ''Go away from here.''

12
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,675
Everyone has deserted the village.
I, alone, stayed here.

13
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,799
I told them not to go.
They wouldn't listen.

14
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,269
Things turned bad after you went
to jail. Evil won the day.

15
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,675
The weak were trampled on.

16
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,592
Where is Mustafa, Ceran?

17
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,318
Left for the city, long time ago...

18
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,912
This place is finished.
Everything's sunk.

19
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,518
Our graves will be next.

20
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,873
Come with me. You'll be
food for the beasts here.

21
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,913
The beasts are of us. Evil is
elsewhere.

22
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,399
I am the madwoman of
this place. I cannot go anywhere.

23
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,153
You're heading for trouble.

24
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,197
I said the same to your father.
I told him ''They'll trap you.''

25
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,837
He wouldn't listen. He went and
didn't come back.

26
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:47,793
Now if I say ''Don't go!'' You'll go.
I know you will.

27
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,393
Take this, Bandit. It will
protect you from bullets.

28
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,274
Are you going to kill me, Bandit?

29
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,233
Aye Mustafa. I will.

30
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,272
Do you have a gun?

31
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,589
I do.

32
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,518
Give it to me.

33
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,514
Why did you inform on me,
brother Mustafa?

34
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,439
Stupidity, poverty, call it what
you like. This has been killing me.

35
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,352
I can't sleep.
You visit me every night.

36
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,829
I hear your footsteps behind
me. I'm tired of watching my back.

37
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,870
People call me informer. I've lost
face. Even my children shun me.

38
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,391
Why did you do it?

39
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,709
I caved in for a few gold pieces.
Shame on those who forced me.

40
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,309
Who forced you?

41
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,310
I was sworn not to tell, but it
doesn't matter anymore.

42
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,433
Berfo made me do it.

43
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,477
Berfo?

44
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,871
Berfo! He is the one who asked
me to inform on you.

45
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,718
Woe, brother Berfo...

46
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,956
Why did he do it?

47
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,559
To steal Keje from you.

48
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,516
Did Keje go with him?

49
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,315
Yeah. she went with him.
After you went to jail...

50
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,195
Berfo took your gold, then
he went to Keje's father.

51
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,393
I begged him not to. I said ''Keje
is Bandit's girl. Spare her at least.''

52
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,315
He said, ''Fool! I did it all for Keje.''

53
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,235
He took the gold and Keje,
and he disappeared.

54
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,830
Then we heard
he went to Istanbul.

55
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,714
So, this is the thirty year story.

56
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,508
So Keje went with him.

57
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,358
Her father made her go.
She became Berfo's.

58
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,072
We put you in jail. I made a
mistake. I was starved.

59
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,433
Still I'm starved brother.
Bad luck, that gold was.

60
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,951
All went to women and gambling,
All of it.

61
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,434
Our village was covered with dam
water. Everyone was scattered around.

62
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,392
No-one knows who is where.

63
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,711
I'm groveling here as you see.

64
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,438
Anyway, thank god it will all end
now. Come on, finish it off.

65
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,189
Bandit... Bandit.

66
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,153
I can't wait any
longer. Kill me...

67
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,834
Bandit! ....

68
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,709
Greetings.

69
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,433
Hello.

70
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,152
Here. You smoke?

71
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,709
Have one of these, uncle.

72
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,032
No... Please.
please take one of these.

73
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,556
Where are you heading, uncle?

74
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,757
Istanbul, God willing.

75
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,871
Yeah, you're the only one missing
anyway.

76
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,798
Oh my God! Shit! The police.
What shall I do now?..

77
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,110
Bring this bag to
Kismet Garage in Tarlabas i.

78
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,238
Bring this to Kismet Garage
Car mechanic's.

79
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,158
For God's sake!

80
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,512
Please... It's life or death
uncle. I'm begging you please.

81
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,518
I'll pay you a lot.
Please do it man!

82
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,072
-Stop! Police.
-What is this, man?..

83
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,719
Shut up! Cut it out! Go on!

84
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,675
Just a moment. There's a mistake.
What's the charge?

85
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,716
Come on brother.
Where are you taking me man?

86
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,309
I'm off the train, nicely going
home.

87
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,189
Excuse me, can I ask something?
What have I done now?

88
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,075
Clean?

89
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,748
Clean.

90
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,116
He's clean, inspector.

91
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,079
Come on, talk man!

92
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,157
Talk what brother?

93
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,072
You! Did you sell us out, you?

94
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,436
No! I swear. There's no such
thing brother Demircan.

95
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,830
How can you give the stuff costing
billions to just anyone in the street?

96
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,793
The police surrounded me.
Honestly, I swear...

97
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,270
I wasn't afraid of getting caught.
It was for the stuff.

98
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,078
Or? Are you a police mole?

99
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,914
What are you saying brother? That's
the guy's suitcase over there.

100
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,152
What did we do? Didn't we send out
two couriers and tipped...

101
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,595
the cops on
on the wrong one?

102
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,758
How come the cops didn't go after
the decoy then? And got you?

103
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,592
This was only your first job. Talk!
Are you an informer? Say it!

104
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,758
Bring him in.

105
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,197
Forgive me brother.
I had trouble finding the place.

106
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,670
That's him! That's the guy!

107
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,757
It is my first time in Istanbul.

108
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,475
Okay. The stuff is here.

109
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,471
Wow! That was a close one.

110
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,518
What's happened to this thing?

111
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,791
It had an accident. I'm sorry.

112
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,395
Here. It was a promise. Buy
yourself new suitcase.

113
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,675
No. I don't want it.

114
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,633
Take it. You have no idea what you
saved me from. Thanks.

115
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,593
Wasn't trouble at all.

116
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,394
Almost had it man. Yours truly
almost would've had it.

117
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,948
Huh?

118
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,433
Nevermind. Okay. Thanks

119
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,958
I'll be off now uncle if it's okay
with you.

120
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,588
What are you doing?

121
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,309
Just looking.

122
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,709
What at?

123
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,957
Where am I now?

124
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,832
Tarlabas i.

125
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,669
Well... Okay.

126
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,429
Where will you go now?

127
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,157
I don't know really. I'm looking
for a place to stay.

128
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,515
A hotel?

129
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,751
Right, friend. Some place
cheap you know.

130
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,270
Ah! Okay. Come with me.

131
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,594
God bless you, brother.
I felt a little strange you know.

132
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,235
Come with me, uncle. Don't worry.

133
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,474
I did it four times.

134
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,393
Big deal.

135
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,360
Cut the crap you two.

136
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,518
You should never trust a woman.
They always cocktease.

137
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,591
-How did it go?
-It was taken care of.

138
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,353
-Is the job done?
-What job?

139
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,271
Are you still there?
Just a minute uncle, wait for me.

140
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,079
How you doing?

141
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,556
Welcome back. Did you take care
of your business?

142
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,030
Yeah. Why the long face?

143
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,193
I got news from my brother.
He's really in a squeeze.

144
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,478
Well. Prison is a tough place.

145
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,279
Emel! Who are you talking to?

146
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,710
Just friends, come on mom.

147
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,712
Okay, see you then.

148
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,076
Get in! What friends at this
hour? Come help me.

149
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,868
You are a slut.
There is whore in you.

150
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,315
The place is coming down again.
The witch's lost it.

151
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,636
This guy is waiting for you.

152
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,791
-Who's this?
-Just a poor old soul.

153
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,189
Where are you taking him?

154
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,397
To my hotel. He has nowhere to stay.
Wait for me.

155
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,159
-Who did he say he was?
-His grandpa.

156
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,275
-No? He's still alive?
-Lay off Avarel, you're a moron.

157
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,434
Cheapest hotel in Tarlabas i.
Girl Naci will do us a favour.

158
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,039
Naci, you got a room?

159
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,958
What do you want it for?

160
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,832
I'm going to stick it up
you know where.

161
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,871
I'll headbutt your face in,
then you'll see.

162
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,713
-Say it girl, got a room?
-Yes Master Cumali, at your service.

163
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,031
Give a room for uncle here.

164
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,959
Who's this guy anyway?
How do I know he'll pay?

165
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,077
Actor Kemal still owes me
a month's rent.

166
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,759
You're having your period or
something?

167
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,475
Give him the room,
don't drive me crazy.

168
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,073
-ID?
-What?

169
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,913
Hakan... What's up kid?

170
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,352
Come here, I'll kill you. I told
him I'm not buying the mintendo thing.

171
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,273
Bastard spat at me.
Comehere!

172
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,988
Come on uncle Kemal have some water
or something.

173
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,355
I'll be alright now.

174
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,910
Alright? You're getting worse every
day.

175
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,758
You've got to see a doctor.

176
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,871
You haven't been around lately.

177
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,673
I took care of some business.

178
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,519
That's my boy.

179
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,831
It is worst when it starts
during shooting.

180
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,636
The other day-what am I saying-six
months ago, I was playing a small part.

181
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,593
I began coughing, it wouldn't
go away.

182
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,110
Finally, they kicked me out.
Didn't pay me, either.

183
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,837
I hate the communists but in those
days these things were better in Russia.

184
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,197
If you fell ill, they
took you straight to hospital.

185
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,830
This would never have happened.
Especially to an artist like you.

186
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,959
Still, those reds. They ruined
my country.

187
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,357
Don't start again Andrei Mishkin.
All that's over now.

188
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,233
You know, you got me out of a
difficult situation there.

189
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,596
Not at all.

190
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,431
Your binoculars puzzled the cops.
I said I was peeping around.

191
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,118
Why do you
carry them around anyway?

192
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,278
Well. It is a keepsake.
You live in this hotel?

193
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,390
Yeah.

194
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,393
Why? Don't you have a family?
A home?

195
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:04,917
No. It's better this way.
Why are you in Istanbul uncle?

196
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,518
I am looking for somebody.

197
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,954
Where is that somebody?

198
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,872
I don't know...

199
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,713
What do you mean
''I don't know''?

200
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,150
I don't know where he is.

201
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,510
How are you going to find him
in this huge city?

202
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,671
I will.

203
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,912
Uncle, ten million people
live in this city.

204
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,470
I will look at all ten million
faces if I have to.

205
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,793
When did you last see
this somebody?

206
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,159
Thirty, thirty five years ago.

207
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,473
And you're going to look for
someone you haven't seen for...

208
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,875
...thirty five years
in a city like Istanbul?

209
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,715
You're out of your mind!

210
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,028
Is she looking?

211
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,794
She is. You got her Cimbom.

212
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,235
What is this? You get mushy the
moment you see the girls.

213
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,993
Are we going out tonight?

214
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,708
We got to do some work first.
We're all broke.

215
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,473
Look at the legs on that Fatma.

216
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,439
I'm not going to spend the rest of
my life stealing car stereos.

217
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,389
Wish we could break into Demircan's
lot. He is close to Mafia.

218
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,317
I risked my life for Demircan's job
while you were sitting...

219
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,678
...on your
backs, you faggots.

220
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,878
Cumali, watch your language man.

221
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,553
Fuck off smart ass! So what?

222
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,552
I'm crazy for this Fatma.

223
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,956
What are you staring at you bums?

224
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,476
She's taking you for a ride, idiot.

225
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,118
What? Stupid!

226
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,830
Isn't this him?

227
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,429
What's up?

228
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,153
Well. You know... Nothing.

229
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,708
You're going to look for
your man?

230
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,549
For God's sake, you'll get lost
uncle!

231
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,797
Really? We'll see.

232
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:20,029
In Istanbul? I don't believe it.
Idiot! Go get lost.

233
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,192
I'll come along with you today. Just
in case. This city could swallow a man.

234
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,951
God bless you. So many people,
so crowded.

235
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,036
Just like the ward
I was in.

236
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,794
Now. Who are we looking for?

237
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,269
Keje.

238
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,194
And where are we headed if we
don't know where she is?

239
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,868
I don't know.

240
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,235
So, Why do we go this way
and not that way?

241
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,792
I don't know. Don't keep asking
questions. I'm only trying to hear...

242
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,358
...the sound of this place.
Don't distract me. Just walk.

243
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,791
We're crazy to be walking
like this. Someone called Keje.

244
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,398
Address: Istanbul.
My feet hurt. This can't go on.

245
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,192
You go back if you want.

246
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,510
What if you get lost?

247
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,998
Displaying your wares again, eh?

248
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,676
You go to the hotel.
I'll be along.

249
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,069
Who's that?

250
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,318
He's the guy who helped me.
Got me walking all day.

251
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,355
Come inside. I'll ask you something.

252
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,352
-What happened to the thing?
-What thing baby?

253
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,153
You were going to take me to see
my brother in prison.

254
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,835
-Anything for you.
-Tomorrow's the open visit.

255
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,632
-Okay, we'll go.
-Mom will kill me if she finds out.

256
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,031
Don't let mom find out about the
prison. She hates my brother.

257
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,309
Come on. Give us a hug.

258
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,959
My dear Kemal Bey.
It's been three months.

259
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,713
I can only bow in humiliation
Naci Bey brother.

260
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,034
I can't wait till you get a part.
This is your last week.

261
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,869
Besides, this coughing of yours.
It's just too much.

262
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,792
I know. Even the syrups don't
soothe it anymore.

263
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,594
All the guests are complaining.
The whole building is shaking.

264
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,119
Any messages for me?

265
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,238
Sure, the mayor called.
He is upset you haven't called.

266
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,590
Fuck off! I'm going out.

267
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,953
The police!
If they ask I'm not here.

268
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,356
If the police find this on me,
I'm fucked. They're already after me.

269
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,716
Why are you armed?
Do you have enemies?

270
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,117
In Istanbul, everyone is your
enemy.

271
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,000
You never know what will
happen next.

272
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:00,873
See how it shines. Fourteen bullets
at a time. We stole it.

273
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,595
Common property of the gang.

274
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,596
What is this place?

275
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,279
Istanbul.

276
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,959
Istanbul!

277
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,798
Where else?

278
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:22,514
Istanbul! It looks like where I
live. There are plains...

279
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:29,473
mountains and towns.
As if I'm on top of Cudi.

280
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,759
How are you?

281
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,437
Fine. I miss you badly though.

282
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,078
Me too, sweetheart.
How's Mom?

283
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,038
God damn her.

284
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,356
Shut up! Cut it out!

285
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,432
Is this him?

286
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,511
Cumali. My brother.

287
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,319
Hello Cumali brother.

288
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,438
Hello brother Sedat. May God
spare you. How are you?

289
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,113
Not too well.

290
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,998
Something wrong?

291
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,873
Yes. Got mixed up in something
here. The top guys passed my...

292
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,509
sentence. They'll stab me.

293
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,994
Sedat!

294
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,872
Shut up! I've got to escape chief.
If I make it to the medical centre,

295
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,435
then I'll escape from the hospital.

296
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,636
But you need to bribe people to get
to the medical centre.

297
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,835
How much?

298
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,639
Two hundred million.

299
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,359
Wow!

300
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,632
Anyway, forget it now.
You're okay?

301
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,952
I'm not.

302
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,951
You take care of this girl chief.
She is your responsibility.

303
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,394
If anything happens to her I will
get out of my grave, and find you.

304
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,549
They will kill him.
How can he get this kind of money?

305
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,273
The money will be found.

306
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,789
Who will find it?
Two hundred million isn't nothing.

307
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,594
I will find it.

308
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,348
No. How can you shoulder such a
burden?

309
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,716
Your brother is
my brother.

310
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,793
Cumali! My hero.

311
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,439
What are you doing here?

312
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,159
Looking around.

313
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,549
What is that in your hand?

314
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,069
Binoculars.

315
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,033
You've no shame? Peeping on
people's wives and daughters.

316
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,198
No, I wouldn't...
I am looking for someone.

317
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,273
With binoculars?

318
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,836
Aye, How else could I see him?

319
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,668
Go away, man.

320
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,232
I have to find two hundred million.

321
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,238
You're kidding?

322
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,676
-Where the hell is he?
-This is for you, from Sekine.

323
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,076
-Where is mine, baby?
-Idiot!

324
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:15,313
Go inside.
And you go home too.

325
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,519
He must have lost his way.

326
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,829
Who?

327
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,196
That guy, the one in the hotel.

328
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,431
Why do you hang around
with that peasant?

329
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,075
Watch your language! He is
old enough to be your father.

330
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,874
This is how I talk to my father.

331
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,678
Hey! Hakan. Where's your mom?

332
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,512
She's out working.

333
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,557
So she went out early today. Naci, girl,
are you sure you didn't see uncle?

334
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,032
I told you I didn't.
You sure get obsessed about things.

335
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,155
The guy's got lost.
I shouldn't have let him go alone.

336
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,118
Where have you been, uncle?
We were all worried about you.

337
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,954
-We thought you were lost.
-I was lost, brother.

338
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,156
Great! So how did you
find your way back?..

339
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,189
The old way. I trailed my way back.
This city is a prison Cumali.

340
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,793
I can't breathe in this city.

341
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,629
It stinks like rotten carcass.
The wards used to smell like this.

342
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,633
Here, I brought you candies.

343
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,628
What's that?

344
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,915
Binoculars.

345
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,992
-Can I have a look?
-Sure.

346
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,831
Who uses this?

347
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,590
The gendarme, army officers,
and once... The bandits.

348
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,038
What is a bandit?

349
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,709
A brigand, a robber.
Living on mountains.

350
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,878
Just a human being like you
and me.

351
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,951
You know any bandits?

352
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,668
I know one. He was called Baran.
The clan chief sent Baran's father...

353
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,873
...to the mined border and had
him killed.

354
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,233
And Baran rebelled and took to the
mountains.

355
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,714
Baran is very young then. He is in
love with a girl. And a terrific shot.

356
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,032
It was a mighty mountain like
that one.

357
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,714
He fought the clan chief's
bandits at that time.

358
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,478
He picked them out with these binoculars
and gave them the bullet.

359
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,035
Are you that Baran?

360
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,909
Yes. I am.

361
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,152
Hakan. To your room, quick!
It is bed time.

362
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,549
Come on, Cumali.

363
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,555
Shut up. Give me the binoculars
Off you go.

364
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,635
Are you a bandit?

365
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,270
It was thirty five years ago.

366
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,034
Wow! Our uncle, a bandit!

367
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,350
So, what have you done
all these thirty five years?

368
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,994
I was in jail.

369
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,709
What? For thirty five years?

370
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,552
Thirty five years.

371
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,469
That's enough to kill a man.

372
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,197
It did kill all my friends.
Look, here.

373
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,075
How come you weren't pardoned?

374
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,429
I killed three more in prison.

375
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,358
What?

376
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,709
They sent hired men on me.
I finished them off.

377
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,311
You were talking about a
sweetheart. Is that Keje?

378
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,353
Aye.

379
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,916
You're looking for her?

380
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,158
Keje and the man who abducted Keje.

381
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,438
The first film about the Southeastern
problem will soon be released.

382
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:42,551
The film is expected to boldly take up
the greatest problem of this country.

383
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,389
In other news. The attempt on
business tycoon Mahmut Saho%lu's

384
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,234
life is under investigation.
The police have not yet made a

385
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,519
public statement. In the meantime,
Saho%lu remains silent.

386
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,593
The elusive Saho%lu is the owner of
an empire that has extraordinarily

387
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,838
grown to the size of thirty
companies in the last twenty years

388
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,119
and has reached everywhere like the
tentacles of an octopus.

389
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:13,317
He recently gave his only TV
interview to date to Mithat Bereket.

390
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,872
Mahmut Bey, you have become the
centre of attention with your

391
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,312
outbursts against the Industrialists'
Association and the government.

392
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,470
Yes!

393
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,836
In fact, there are various
unpleasant allegations about your

394
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,668
own wealth. You accuse the
Association of illegal practices,

395
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,192
but you cannot explain how you grew
so powerful in a matter of twenty years?

396
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,034
You are also accused of loansharking
and of seizing businesses with

397
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,476
Mafia assistance.Your textile factory
is shown as an example.

398
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,439
There are also allegations
that granting of your bankers'

399
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,149
licence is somewhat questionable.
-Who sent you here?

400
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,390
Excuse me?

401
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,078
You! Who pays you? How dare you
present rumours as the truth?

402
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,396
Please watch your tone. You can't
talk to me like that.

403
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,714
Go send me your boss...
You won't pull me down, ever!

404
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,798
-I am a journalist.
-You are a hired pen!

405
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,076
No, I am an independent journalist.

406
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,478
I employ a hundred people like
you. Go tell those who mess with me

407
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,236
they can't tear me down. They
don't have what it takes.

408
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,110
Get out of my house! Get out!
Turn the damn thing off. Cut!

409
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,072
I found you.

410
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,511
What does it say?
Come on, tell us.

411
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,948
I'm not saying!

412
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,998
Say it and I'll treat you to a
whore.

413
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,792
Fuck off then, don't!

414
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,150
-You're going to talk, or not?
-Cumali, don't!

415
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,477
-It could go off, man.
-Speak up, what did she write?

416
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,153
Brother Cumali, come help me.

417
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,833
What is it? What happened?

418
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,993
Come to the hotel. I'll show you
someone. I saw him. On TV.

419
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,875
I'll be right back. You guys stay
put. We'll be on a job tonight.

420
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,198
Yeah, you put the kid to bed.

421
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,632
Make sure he drinks his milk.
Did you wet yourself?

422
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,229
He was here?

423
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,196
Who?

424
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,355
Berfo! In a wheelchair.
Tubes up his nose.

425
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,670
Where is he? Where has he gone?

426
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,274
Who are you talking about, man?..

427
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,192
He means Mahmut Saho%lu.

428
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,677
Mahmut Saho%lu? You know him?

429
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,315
Take me to him.

430
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,278
Why did you bring this geezer?

431
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,955
Hush! He'll hear.
He is an old bandit.

432
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,918
-What?
-A bandit!

433
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,349
Meaning what?

434
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,750
You know, a bandit. On the
mountains. A highwayman.

435
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,399
You sure he didn't make it up?

436
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,194
I saw the photo. He snuffed three
people in prison.

437
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,954
Imagine what he
must have done in the mountains.

438
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,191
Run for it!

439
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,555
Hey, Bandit, come on!

440
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,837
Will you find him for me?
Take me to him

441
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,310
Give me a break, for God's sake.

442
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:31,958
God damn it.
We're just drifting bums.

443
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,477
Every job should have some
respectability. Look at us.

444
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,757
As they say: Live fast, die young
and you'll leave a handsome corpse.

445
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,716
Let me tell you something. Only way
to play this game is to play it big

446
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,437
When my father migrated to
Istanbul, he got a job as a waiter.

447
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,278
That's where he lost the game

448
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,591
I've been a mechanic, a bouncer
at clubs, parked cars.

449
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,673
Still I am a nobody.
I went to jail for nothing.

450
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,114
We're all the same.

451
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,590
The other day, I quarreled with my
dad, He wants me to go back to my...

452
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,399
job at the factory. I said no.

453
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,871
You're a worker and look where it
got us. He went mad.

454
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,832
We should all move out like Cumali.

455
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,594
I will go to brother Demircan. I'll
say: Rescue us from this life.

456
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,074
Get us on your team.

457
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,271
We'd be like royalty round here.

458
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,278
We'll get respect, man.

459
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,955
Everyone will look up to us,
shop owners etc. The girls.

460
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,079
Maybe I shouldn't come.

461
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,955
Sure! Left to yourself, you'd
get lost again. Stick to me

462
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,355
Just a minute, uncle.

463
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,874
Beg your pardon?

464
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,316
The week is over. You owe me.

465
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,794
Put him on my bill.

466
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,832
-But, Cumali...
-Shut up or I'll clobber you.

467
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:53,472
I have friends, I have partners I am
responsible to. I have to be careful.

468
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:00,029
Now, you almost sank us on that job
the other day. Still, you didn't

469
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:06,196
talk to the police, you're okay. I
know that.

470
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,914
Our business is no kids' play,
amateurs fail.

471
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,312
So last time, you begged and prayed
and I let you have your chance.

472
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,835
What will you say for yourself
this time Cumali?

473
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,958
This time we are here to put
ourselves entirely at your command.

474
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,031
I and my friends are solid, brother
Demircan.

475
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,077
Order us to die and we will.

476
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,999
And we know our way around.

477
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,714
You can't find better men to deal
the stuff.

478
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,434
There isn't a club we don't know.

479
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,036
Give us just one chance,
then decide.

480
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,630
Okay, we'll give it a try. Not a
word to anyone about this though.

481
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,877
And stay out of the
police's way.

482
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,118
If you get caught
I don't know you.

483
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,755
And this uncle over there, is he
part of your gang?

484
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,070
No. He's a bandit.

485
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,273
A real bandit. A mountain man.
That's of course, back when.

486
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,833
No bandits left on the mountains,
uncle.

487
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,992
Now, all the bandits are
down in the city.

488
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,039
I have important news for you.

489
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,753
Come inside, mom's out.

490
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,713
Sekine, when will you put out?
Cimbom's all horny.

491
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,956
God damn you, asshole!

492
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,992
Didn't I tell you not to wear
mini-skirts?

493
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,038
Mom first, now you start.
You jealous pig!

494
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,070
What is it?

495
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,753
We have a deal with brother
Demircan.

496
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,632
We'll push some of
the stuff for him.

497
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,913
So, it means we're finding money.
Don't look at my face like an idiot.

498
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,593
I'll be able to save your
brother.

499
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,796
Thank god!
My hero!

500
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,356
Don't. Mom will be
back any minute now.

501
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,392
Come on girl, give it to me.
We'll be married anyway.

502
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,119
Not before the wedding,

503
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,794
Shit! It's mom.

504
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,997
What shall we do? Let's pretend we
are just talking.

505
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,629
No! To the window...

506
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,833
Keje...

507
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,959
Keje...

508
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,232
Keje...

509
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,189
We almost got nailed there.

510
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,350
This is not the right way to go.

511
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,999
What's wrong with way?

512
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,950
Drugs are bad news. Don't do it.
You are poisoning people.

513
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,796
I've known many dealers in prison.
They all ended up badly.

514
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:43,038
''Don't do it'', eh? What should I do
then? Is theft better?

515
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,795
Or conning people?
Which one is better?

516
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,674
None. None of that is fitting for
human beings.

517
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,632
All of that is fitting for human
beings.

518
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,758
Or they wouldn't be around.
Why did you do it then?

519
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:05,835
You know why my dad named me Cumali?
My father adored Yilmaz Gney.

520
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,199
He named me after one of Gney's
screen characters.

521
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,916
He saw ''Ince Cumali''
fifteen times.

522
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,232
In everyday life my father imitated
Yilmaz Gney.

523
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:26,076
Walked and talked like him.
Looked a bit like him too.

524
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,352
My stepmother betrayed
him. Can you imagine?

525
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,597
A betrayed hero!

526
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,513
He shot them both. My stepmother
was crippled and the guy died.

527
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,277
So that's what my father got for
being a good guy.

528
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,879
I mean, anything can happen in
life.

529
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,951
Besides, I don't like doing this. But
Emel needs the money for her brother.

530
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:15,269
Back in jail, we knew two Kemals,
Mustafa Kemal and Dodo Kemal.

531
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:22,350
Dodo Kemal was a very young
convict. A murderer.

532
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,473
Every morning, he used to get the
papers first. He used to go through...

533
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:30,271
the pages like crazy, looking for
news of an amnesty.

534
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:37,796
After years of this, he did receive
his pardon and was freed.

535
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,716
A week later, he had murdered
someone and was back in jail.

536
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:57,957
You remind me of him. If I had
a son, he would be your age.

537
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,593
And if my father were alive, he
would be your age, Bandit.

538
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,995
Will you take me to him, brother.

539
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,395
Who?

540
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,598
The man on the TV.
Take me to him.

541
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,398
That's all I ask of you.
This is my request.

542
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,792
Is this the place?

543
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,110
Yes. This is it.

544
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,918
Are you sure?

545
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,073
Don't drive me nuts Bandit.
You said ''take me'', and I did.

546
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,749
This guy is one of the richest guys
in Turkey.

547
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,956
What is your business
with him uncle?

548
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,988
Look, I'm leaving. Can you find
your way back to the hotel?

549
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:44,399
You saw what you wanted to see.
The car's gone too. Let's go now.

550
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,515
Who are you looking for, man. Why
should I care anyway?

551
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,149
I don't own you.
I'm leaving.

552
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,351
Hey! What's going on? Just a
minute. Where are you taking us?

553
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,872
Didn't I tell you ''Let's go''
It is my fault. I should have left.

554
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:12,477
Get lost if you want. Am I your mom
or your dad? You're a grown man.

555
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,237
Get me out of here!
Get me out!

556
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,797
I'll break down the door.
Get me out of here!

557
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,314
Stop it Bandit! Are you out of your
mind? Don't!

558
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,068
What were you doing there?..

559
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,670
Were you there to kill Mahmut Bey?

560
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,554
No. I don't have a gun.

561
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,917
Why were you watching the place?

562
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,076
You're an ex-convict.
Are you a hitman?

563
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,431
No such thing.

564
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,917
Sir, there's a call for you sir.

565
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,031
Sir, please let me explain, you see,
this poor old guy is penniless.

566
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,756
We were looking for a job for
him when we saw that mansion.

567
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,914
We thought they might be hiring
a gardener or something.

568
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,238
We are not terrorists or anything.
We are your decent, honest...

569
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,356
one hundred percent Turkish,
sort of people.

570
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,715
Cut it out! Get out of here,
both of you.

571
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,755
See, my spiel worked. The guys
thought we were terrorists.

572
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,630
You're not going to
that house again, understand?

573
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,629
Hello.

574
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,069
Hello brother.

575
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,795
You are coming with us.

576
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,315
Where are you going?
Who are you?

577
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,313
You are not coming. Just him.

578
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,989
Come Baran.
Come closer.

579
00:58:28,993 --> 00:58:32,588
I'll tear off these tubes!
This emphysema is a motherfucker.

580
00:58:33,673 --> 00:58:40,192
I've never been so helpless.
Oxygen is like poison.

581
00:58:40,393 --> 00:58:44,386
After a while, it starts eating up your
brain. It makes you speak nonsense.

582
00:58:47,673 --> 00:58:49,789
You have changed
your name, Berfo.

583
00:58:51,193 --> 00:58:54,265
Aye. I changed my name.

584
00:58:57,153 --> 00:58:58,984
Is Keje alive?

585
00:58:59,793 --> 00:59:01,545
Yes.

586
00:59:06,033 --> 00:59:07,546
Is she with you?

587
00:59:08,793 --> 00:59:10,385
Yes.

588
00:59:13,313 --> 00:59:16,350
Why did you betray me Berfo?

589
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:27,432
Betray? So you call this betrayal,
do you? I give up.

590
00:59:32,753 --> 00:59:38,623
Now if I say to you: I did all of
that because I was in love.

591
00:59:38,953 --> 00:59:42,662
I was dying from love.

592
00:59:42,953 --> 00:59:45,706
Who could possibly say anything
to me?

593
00:59:46,033 --> 00:59:49,469
What the hell is ''betrayal''?
I did it for love, damn it.

594
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:56,062
Yes I did it. I am a man who has
informed on his closest friend.

595
00:59:56,353 --> 01:00:01,427
Could you have done that?
Betray your most beloved friend?

596
01:00:01,713 --> 01:00:09,586
Could you steal his gold and use it
to buy the woman your friend loved?

597
01:00:14,593 --> 01:00:17,061
Could you have sent your friend to
certain death.

598
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:22,433
I did do it. For love.
Now tell me.

599
01:00:23,473 --> 01:00:27,352
Which one of us loved Keje
more? You, or I?

600
01:00:29,233 --> 01:00:33,146
Which one of us
dared to sin like that?

601
01:00:33,393 --> 01:00:40,822
I am ready to burn in hell
for this love. Are you?

602
01:00:59,873 --> 01:01:05,311
Keje didn't want me though. Granted
when I paid her father...

603
01:01:05,633 --> 01:01:16,862
Keje curiously gave in. She followed
me But never spoke a word since.

604
01:01:19,913 --> 01:01:23,269
Not to me, not to anyone else.

605
01:01:25,193 --> 01:01:28,947
For thirty five years now, she has
kept silent, Baran.

606
01:01:29,233 --> 01:01:35,786
I begged her to speak, I beat her,
threw her out in the street.

607
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:42,985
I wept at her feet, but she
didn't speak.

608
01:01:43,353 --> 01:01:47,346
She didn't speak and she didn't
give me children.

609
01:01:47,673 --> 01:01:50,551
Still, I wouldn't give Keje up.

610
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:55,349
I didn't re-marry and
I didn't ask for children.

611
01:02:01,353 --> 01:02:05,062
If I had wanted it,
you couldn't see me.

612
01:02:05,353 --> 01:02:09,949
I could have sent you back to
that prison.

613
01:02:13,153 --> 01:02:16,589
Do you know why you are here?

614
01:02:20,513 --> 01:02:24,745
You will go to Keje and talk to
her.

615
01:02:24,993 --> 01:02:28,065
If she doesn't speak to you either,
then I'll know she has given up on

616
01:02:28,433 --> 01:02:32,392
the world, I'll know she doesn't
want anybody.

617
01:02:32,633 --> 01:02:35,750
That she has buried herself alive.

618
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:45,232
And if she speaks?

619
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:36,830
Keje. Keje.

620
01:03:42,233 --> 01:03:46,784
I was shot in jail, Keje.
I didn't die.

621
01:03:48,513 --> 01:03:54,782
I fell ill, I left one lung there,
still I lived on.

622
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:58,701
They beat me up relentlessly.

623
01:03:58,993 --> 01:04:07,992
But I didn't die. I
lived on to see you once again.

624
01:04:13,073 --> 01:04:20,753
Now I am told that no-one hears your
voice, that you have stopped speaking.

625
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:33,225
Aren't you going to talk to me
either, Keje?

626
01:04:33,513 --> 01:04:37,222
Am I not going to hear your voice?

627
01:04:56,633 --> 01:04:58,624
Do bandits...

628
01:05:02,753 --> 01:05:04,391
...still...

629
01:05:09,553 --> 01:05:12,147
...turn into...

630
01:05:12,713 --> 01:05:17,184
...stars when they die?

631
01:05:31,913 --> 01:05:38,261
On the mountains, you hear the
sounds of wilderness.

632
01:05:39,993 --> 01:05:45,545
I used to lie on a rock and watch
the sky, the stars.

633
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:50,985
I would think
of you.

634
01:05:52,233 --> 01:05:56,465
And a star would shoot across the
sky and I would say...

635
01:05:57,433 --> 01:06:01,187
''There, another
bandit has died.''

636
01:06:03,673 --> 01:06:10,704
I would remember, when we were kids
how I told you of ancient brigands...

637
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:15,951
and how you looked at the
stars.

638
01:06:27,673 --> 01:06:29,231
I also...

639
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:32,545
...have been...

640
01:06:34,753 --> 01:06:38,985
...watching the stars
at night.

641
01:06:43,513 --> 01:06:44,832
But..

642
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:48,903
...I have not seen you.

643
01:06:52,113 --> 01:06:54,104
That's how I knew...

644
01:06:55,233 --> 01:06:57,224
...you were alive.

645
01:07:01,033 --> 01:07:04,628
And I waited for the day you would
come back.

646
01:07:06,873 --> 01:07:08,989
My voice sounds...

647
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:13,988
...strange to me now.

648
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:21,623
As if someone else is speaking.
and I am listening.

649
01:07:25,193 --> 01:07:29,072
I lived my whole life for this
moment alone.

650
01:07:29,873 --> 01:07:33,582
Whatever happens now, let it.

651
01:07:34,553 --> 01:07:39,673
I will come back for you.
Wait for me, Keje.

652
01:07:47,433 --> 01:07:50,903
Well done boys. Here you are.

653
01:07:55,473 --> 01:07:57,862
I hope we've done a good job,
brother Demircan.

654
01:08:07,033 --> 01:08:09,501
Do you still want to join the
team?

655
01:08:16,433 --> 01:08:18,549
You mean we're in the Mafia now?

656
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:21,347
Let's get laid tonight.
Let's splash out.

657
01:08:22,393 --> 01:08:23,792
How much did you take?

658
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:25,307
More than you did.

659
01:08:25,513 --> 01:08:26,548
Why is that?

660
01:08:26,873 --> 01:08:29,262
I'm the boss. I arranged the job.

661
01:08:31,553 --> 01:08:34,863
Don't steal from me again.
Don't steal my money!

662
01:08:35,073 --> 01:08:36,506
I swear to buggery, I haven't
Cemal.

663
01:08:36,793 --> 01:08:39,466
They don't call me Razor Cemal
for nothing, I swear I'll cut you up.

664
01:08:39,753 --> 01:08:42,586
I swear I'm only putting aside a
few pennies for the nitedo.

665
01:08:42,793 --> 01:08:43,908
What the hell is that?

666
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:45,268
A toy for the kid.

667
01:08:45,553 --> 01:08:47,623
Don't make me shit on your toy.
I'll kill you.

668
01:08:51,073 --> 01:08:53,143
Don't, brother. She is
our sister.

669
01:08:55,713 --> 01:08:57,351
Cemal, don't!

670
01:08:57,593 --> 01:09:01,791
Stay out of this, old fart.
You might catch your death.

671
01:09:05,873 --> 01:09:09,104
Why didn't you kill that man?
She beats up mom all the time.

672
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:11,821
Weren't you a bad-knit?

673
01:09:15,913 --> 01:09:19,383
That was way back when.
I am not a bandit any more.

674
01:09:22,793 --> 01:09:25,626
Who did this? You went to
that guy again, didn't you?

675
01:09:26,193 --> 01:09:31,506
It wasn't them. Just a little
accident downstairs.

676
01:09:34,713 --> 01:09:36,590
Weren't you done with that?

677
01:09:37,033 --> 01:09:38,751
This is the last time.

678
01:09:39,233 --> 01:09:41,349
No-one knows about it.
You don't either, okay?

679
01:09:41,633 --> 01:09:46,627
I cut on what Demircan gave
us. If he finds out, he'll skin me.

680
01:09:47,713 --> 01:09:49,510
You said you wouldn't.

681
01:09:49,793 --> 01:09:53,672
I swear this is the last time.
I'm doing this for Emel's brother.

682
01:09:56,993 --> 01:10:02,067
Don't tell anyone.
Not even the gang.

683
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:16,990
I'm sorry. See what happened to
you because of me.

684
01:10:17,233 --> 01:10:18,586
Don't mention it. It's alright.

685
01:10:18,953 --> 01:10:20,625
That pimp wasn't worth it dear.

686
01:10:20,873 --> 01:10:22,226
No harm done..

687
01:10:22,553 --> 01:10:25,863
My son says you used to be
a bandit. That you will save us all.

688
01:10:26,153 --> 01:10:28,906
Kids are strange.
He is making it up.

689
01:10:29,153 --> 01:10:32,862
He's always been a dreamer anyway.

690
01:10:49,753 --> 01:10:51,630
Do I have any messages, my dear
Naci Bey?

691
01:10:51,913 --> 01:10:53,551
I am not your personal secretary.

692
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,393
No, it's just that, it was about
this film.

693
01:11:01,193 --> 01:11:02,421
A glass of wine?

694
01:11:02,793 --> 01:11:05,432
No, Andrei Mishkin.
It's bad for my cough.

695
01:11:05,753 --> 01:11:08,665
My father used to be
a connoisseur of wine.

696
01:11:08,913 --> 01:11:11,950
As you know, ambassadors value
expertise in wine,

697
01:11:12,153 --> 01:11:13,905
more than anything else.

698
01:11:14,153 --> 01:11:21,104
He would feel its bouquet, its
aroma and establish its vintage.

699
01:11:24,233 --> 01:11:26,508
He used drink white wine
in a tulip glass...

700
01:11:26,873 --> 01:11:30,468
and the red in short stemmed Roman.

701
01:11:30,713 --> 01:11:35,264
He opened an exquisite bottle the day
I graduated from Law School.

702
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:42,466
I, timidly, told him I wouldn't practise
law and I wanted to be an actor,

703
01:11:43,193 --> 01:11:45,991
he threw me out of the
house.

704
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:49,267
You made a mistake by choosing
acting.

705
01:11:49,553 --> 01:11:53,546
No. See, I am penniless, I can't pay
the rent, I can't even buy medicine.

706
01:11:53,873 --> 01:11:56,706
But I wouldn't give up acting for
anything. I don't mind the illness

707
01:11:57,073 --> 01:12:00,588
but being a burden on other people
saddens me.

708
01:12:20,793 --> 01:12:22,909
Cumali has raised the money.

709
01:12:23,193 --> 01:12:24,467
What?

710
01:12:26,473 --> 01:12:29,351
The two hundred million is ready,
brother Sedat.

711
01:12:30,113 --> 01:12:32,024
You're kidding!

712
01:12:37,913 --> 01:12:41,986
Please brother. Please.
It's nothing.

713
01:12:50,673 --> 01:12:55,667
You are quite a guy, you know that?
I entrust Emel to you.

714
01:12:57,153 --> 01:13:00,145
God knows when I'll appear again.

715
01:13:00,353 --> 01:13:03,265
Slip the money to the guard,
he'll give it to me.

716
01:13:25,993 --> 01:13:29,269
Brother Cumali, I have
decided to return home.

717
01:13:30,673 --> 01:13:32,106
And Keje?

718
01:13:32,433 --> 01:13:33,991
I will take her with me as well.

719
01:13:34,233 --> 01:13:35,632
That would mean war.

720
01:13:35,993 --> 01:13:41,545
No. It wouldn't. I have to
make some money though.

721
01:13:42,753 --> 01:13:44,505
You mean I'm supposed to
find you a job.

722
01:13:44,793 --> 01:13:46,943
Aye. That's it.

723
01:13:47,233 --> 01:13:51,670
You go to the hotel and stay put.
I'll take care of it.

724
01:13:57,673 --> 01:13:59,709
I bet he is not getting any action
either.

725
01:14:00,113 --> 01:14:01,910
-How do you mean?
-How do you mean?

726
01:14:02,193 --> 01:14:04,707
The poor soul has gone thirty
five years without a woman.

727
01:14:05,033 --> 01:14:08,025
That's right.
I wonder if he ever did it.

728
01:14:55,393 --> 01:14:57,224
Cumali.

729
01:15:02,713 --> 01:15:05,273
An amulet? How cute.

730
01:15:05,593 --> 01:15:07,345
It's for bullets.

731
01:15:07,593 --> 01:15:09,345
Bullets?

732
01:15:09,593 --> 01:15:14,713
It is said that no bullets will
touch a man wearing this.

733
01:15:14,993 --> 01:15:17,666
Come on, don't look so naive.

734
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:20,985
Don't worry about the fee,
it's on Cumali.

735
01:15:21,193 --> 01:15:22,626
What?

736
01:15:27,513 --> 01:15:30,073
What is it? Trouble?

737
01:15:31,113 --> 01:15:35,982
No. Mom's at my aunt's tonight.
So I thought I'd drop by.

738
01:15:38,073 --> 01:15:43,830
Wow! I've hit the jackpot, girl.
Come here you.

739
01:15:49,233 --> 01:15:52,305
Slow down! I shouldn't have come.
You're behaving like an animal.

740
01:15:52,513 --> 01:15:55,266
I've had enough of your
teasing. Come here.

741
01:15:55,513 --> 01:15:57,947
Let go of my arm...
I swear you're hurting me.

742
01:15:58,233 --> 01:16:01,703
Let go I said, or I'll get
mad.

743
01:16:13,593 --> 01:16:20,192
God bless you, but I am tied to
someone else.

744
01:16:23,393 --> 01:16:31,266
You're offering me a treasure but,
I can't. Go to your child.

745
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:38,947
Can't I stay a little longer then?

746
01:16:49,953 --> 01:16:53,263
I promise I won't bother you.

747
01:17:20,713 --> 01:17:26,071
We belong to each other now. If
necessary, I'll marry you under...

748
01:17:26,713 --> 01:17:33,232
both religious and civil law.
I gave my word to your brother.

749
01:17:42,913 --> 01:17:47,623
What a nasty world this is!

750
01:17:50,753 --> 01:17:53,551
Thanks for all
you've done for my brother.

751
01:18:04,353 --> 01:18:11,384
I love you so bad, man.
I'm going to die of this love, man.

752
01:19:20,073 --> 01:19:24,112
You too must return home,
Androshka Mishkin.

753
01:19:24,353 --> 01:19:29,347
To die in your own country
Even if the communists are back.

754
01:19:42,713 --> 01:19:45,785
What kind of country is this?
An ambassador's son hangs himself...

755
01:19:46,033 --> 01:19:49,867
because he couldn't get medicine.
He couldn't see a doctor.

756
01:19:50,073 --> 01:19:51,426
That's what this country is like.

757
01:19:51,673 --> 01:19:56,793
That's why we have to have money.
You are powerful if you have money.

758
01:19:57,433 --> 01:20:01,142
She's gone... the slut!
The whore! She ran away!

759
01:20:01,393 --> 01:20:03,907
She left me alone like this.

760
01:20:04,593 --> 01:20:08,791
No... I swear I didn't do a thing.
I wasn't the one.

761
01:20:09,273 --> 01:20:12,822
Idiot! I'm not talking about you,
I mean her lover. He was in jail.

762
01:20:13,073 --> 01:20:15,268
Now he escaped.
And they ran off together.

763
01:20:15,513 --> 01:20:17,947
Her father had also run away like
this. God damn them all.

764
01:20:18,353 --> 01:20:20,423
Wasn't that her brother in jail?

765
01:20:20,713 --> 01:20:24,592
What brother? It was her lover!
She fooled you, the slut.

766
01:20:24,913 --> 01:20:34,026
He was a sworn hooligan. Here, the
letter. I couldn't separate them.

767
01:20:34,513 --> 01:20:37,505
The bastard went to jail, but
she still stuck with him.

768
01:20:40,353 --> 01:20:43,743
God! The whore really took good
advantage of you, man.

769
01:20:43,993 --> 01:20:46,427
Milked you like a cow.

770
01:20:50,113 --> 01:20:53,549
Shut up you, shut up!
I'm going nuts.

771
01:21:00,513 --> 01:21:01,946
Brother Demircan wants you.

772
01:21:02,193 --> 01:21:03,103
Later...

773
01:21:03,393 --> 01:21:05,065
Now.

774
01:21:08,913 --> 01:21:14,545
Get me those buggers! Find them.
Wherever they crawled in. Find them!

775
01:21:40,033 --> 01:21:42,672
Nice place, isn't it?

776
01:21:42,953 --> 01:21:45,183
Very nice, brother. It's paradise.

777
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:47,628
I'm closing the deal on it.

778
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:50,142
I'll divide it into plots and I'll
sell it to the developers.

779
01:21:50,393 --> 01:21:53,703
Cumali, some of the stuff we gave
you is missing.

780
01:21:57,233 --> 01:22:00,305
We brought you all the money we got
right and honest, brother.

781
01:22:00,553 --> 01:22:03,590
Please brother. You know
we aren't that sort.

782
01:22:04,233 --> 01:22:09,353
You were seen dealing the other
night. You sold our stuff...

783
01:22:10,113 --> 01:22:11,432
and got your money.

784
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:14,546
So I wondered whose stuff it was
that you were dealing.

785
01:22:14,873 --> 01:22:17,706
No brother, definitely.
We're your men.

786
01:22:17,993 --> 01:22:20,302
There must be a mistake here
somewhere.

787
01:22:21,793 --> 01:22:25,024
Still, keep your eyes open. We've
got two packs missing.

788
01:22:25,313 --> 01:22:26,587
If you hear anything.

789
01:22:26,873 --> 01:22:28,909
Sure brother, your wish is my
command.

790
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:32,190
Hey lad, it seems something else
is on your mind.

791
01:22:34,753 --> 01:22:39,907
Somebody played a trick on me,
I'm pissed. But I'll get even.

792
01:22:40,513 --> 01:22:46,349
That's my boy. Never forgive
things done to you. I never did.

793
01:23:12,113 --> 01:23:13,387
What's this?

794
01:23:13,713 --> 01:23:16,307
The stereo wouldn't come off,
so I swiped the whole car.

795
01:23:16,513 --> 01:23:17,741
Come on. Get off the car.

796
01:23:29,873 --> 01:23:34,628
I'm sorry. I lost control.

797
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:40,024
Here. Shoot me.

798
01:23:40,273 --> 01:23:42,833
Don't be stupid. Put it back.

799
01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:47,421
Any news on Emel?

800
01:23:47,633 --> 01:23:48,952
No.

801
01:24:02,713 --> 01:24:06,262
They are at this hotel.
Go bring my daughter.

802
01:24:06,513 --> 01:24:13,669
The bastard bedded me first, spent
my money. Then he seduced Emel.

803
01:24:15,273 --> 01:24:19,949
Go bring my daughter. I'll give you
whatever you want. Anything.

804
01:24:21,873 --> 01:24:23,545
Bandit! Come here.

805
01:24:25,073 --> 01:24:26,347
Where to?

806
01:24:35,553 --> 01:24:37,464
-The call?
-It didn't come.

807
01:24:37,753 --> 01:24:39,471
What if it came while we were out?

808
01:24:39,913 --> 01:24:42,950
We never went out. We made love
non-stop. You are an animal.

809
01:24:43,193 --> 01:24:44,706
My bones are aching.

810
01:24:44,993 --> 01:24:47,712
We have to get the passports
today.

811
01:25:32,473 --> 01:25:35,112
We catch the loving brother and
sister in bed.

812
01:25:35,353 --> 01:25:38,026
Do brothers do this to their sisters?

813
01:25:38,273 --> 01:25:42,061
Don't you know incest
results in disaster?

814
01:25:42,713 --> 01:25:46,103
God forbid, you could have
handicapped kids or something.

815
01:25:58,193 --> 01:26:00,024
Now look here, whore.

816
01:26:00,313 --> 01:26:04,101
I'm going to pull the trigger,
and blow the bastard's head off.

817
01:26:04,393 --> 01:26:08,227
Bloody pieces of his brains
will splatter all over your face.

818
01:26:08,473 --> 01:26:10,543
Don't do it. Don'! Don't!

819
01:26:10,793 --> 01:26:12,943
I will, I will, I will.

820
01:26:13,553 --> 01:26:17,910
Brother, I did wrong, okay,
she's all yours. Let me go.

821
01:26:18,113 --> 01:26:20,707
Let's forget the whole thing.
I'll never cross your path again. Ever.

822
01:26:20,913 --> 01:26:23,427
I'll stand guard at the door.

823
01:26:28,873 --> 01:26:33,264
See who you left me for! The guy
for whom you broke my heart.

824
01:26:33,633 --> 01:26:38,229
And I stole from the worst man
in the country for you.

825
01:26:38,673 --> 01:26:41,585
I put my life in the line.
If he hears it, he'll wipe me off.

826
01:26:41,833 --> 01:26:43,391
I do that for you, and you do this
to me.

827
01:26:43,753 --> 01:26:46,870
And all for this bugger.
How could you?

828
01:26:49,233 --> 01:26:52,270
Don't!

829
01:26:53,433 --> 01:26:59,383
This is not worth going to
jail for. Spare them.

830
01:27:04,473 --> 01:27:06,668
We're going.

831
01:27:35,553 --> 01:27:38,386
I always imagined it would be hard
to kill a man.

832
01:27:38,633 --> 01:27:41,352
But it was so easy, Bandit.

833
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:32,348
You go back home. Now murder
has come into this.

834
01:28:32,593 --> 01:28:36,506
Police is in this thing.
We'll go elsewhere.

835
01:28:51,953 --> 01:28:54,387
I've ruined my life.

836
01:29:05,873 --> 01:29:09,263
We must get out of town.
Go to the mountains.

837
01:29:11,153 --> 01:29:12,552
Where?

838
01:29:12,873 --> 01:29:15,945
We will go up the mountain.
They can't find us there.

839
01:29:16,233 --> 01:29:17,791
We will take her, and go...

840
01:29:17,993 --> 01:29:18,903
Keje?

841
01:29:19,153 --> 01:29:20,302
Keje.

842
01:29:20,753 --> 01:29:23,711
Let's go to the hotel tonight, and
get our things.

843
01:29:23,953 --> 01:29:26,421
My money's at the hotel, too.

844
01:29:58,513 --> 01:30:01,789
Come out!
Come here. I'm talking to you.

845
01:30:02,513 --> 01:30:04,344
Stop, or I'll shoot!

846
01:30:38,193 --> 01:30:39,592
What place is this?

847
01:30:39,833 --> 01:30:41,186
I don't know.

848
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:44,985
I was hit.

849
01:30:46,313 --> 01:30:48,031
Let me see.

850
01:30:50,913 --> 01:30:52,426
Shall I die?

851
01:30:52,673 --> 01:30:54,152
Everybody dies.

852
01:30:54,433 --> 01:30:56,025
Will this wound kill me?

853
01:30:56,313 --> 01:31:00,704
No. It's just the skin.
Don't worry.

854
01:31:01,393 --> 01:31:08,708
I've never been wounded before.
We couldn't get the money either.

855
01:31:29,033 --> 01:31:35,984
We'll make it, won't we? We'll
get out of this whore of a city?

856
01:32:03,633 --> 01:32:04,952
Get out of here.

857
01:32:05,233 --> 01:32:08,225
The police are looking for you.
You'll get us in trouble, too.

858
01:32:08,473 --> 01:32:11,943
We'll just lie low for a day or
two, and then we'll leave.

859
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:13,467
Definitely not. Go away from here.

860
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:16,711
Auntie, dear... Okay. Lend me some
money then.

861
01:32:16,833 --> 01:32:21,987
Go away! Not a penny for you.
You were trouble even as a child.

862
01:32:23,233 --> 01:32:29,308
When I was a child? Very well,
Let me tell you about my childhood.

863
01:32:29,713 --> 01:32:31,385
There's nothing to tell.

864
01:32:33,313 --> 01:32:35,543
You know what I went through in
this house after my father...

865
01:32:35,833 --> 01:32:37,505
-went to jail, don't you?
-Shut up!

866
01:32:37,913 --> 01:32:40,188
Every time your child-bugging
husband came after me...

867
01:32:40,513 --> 01:32:42,185
you would
hide in the kitchen.

868
01:32:42,553 --> 01:32:44,987
That bugger almost raped me before
I stabbed him.

869
01:32:45,273 --> 01:32:48,424
Every time he made a pass, you looked
away 'cos he might leave you.

870
01:32:48,713 --> 01:32:50,385
Talk about decency, you slut!

871
01:32:50,673 --> 01:32:52,391
You screwed every guy in the
neighbourhood.

872
01:32:52,633 --> 01:32:55,670
Go away. Get out of my house.
Police! Help!

873
01:33:27,673 --> 01:33:31,632
We've got to find some money.
Can you ask Keje?

874
01:33:32,073 --> 01:33:34,189
No. I can't.

875
01:33:36,113 --> 01:33:39,185
Suppose we robbed someplace?

876
01:33:39,673 --> 01:33:42,346
I took an oath not to do such
things.

877
01:33:42,673 --> 01:33:46,461
You say no to everything.
You get us money then.

878
01:33:48,113 --> 01:33:51,867
Hey, Deli. Listen, we're fine.
Get us some money.

879
01:33:52,153 --> 01:33:54,189
We've got money. Brother Demircan
gave us work. Come over.

880
01:33:54,473 --> 01:33:55,986
Are you crazy? The police are
everywhere.

881
01:33:56,313 --> 01:33:58,110
No they are gone. They think you
left for good.

882
01:33:58,433 --> 01:34:02,062
We'll be over. Okay.
I'm going back to the neighbourhood

883
01:34:02,313 --> 01:34:06,067
You go. I have to take care of some
business. I will see you there.

884
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:08,744
Don't get lost, okay?

885
01:34:20,793 --> 01:34:27,232
We have to leave the city. There's
this lad who helped me a lot.

886
01:34:28,193 --> 01:34:32,869
He is in trouble. I must
help him.

887
01:34:37,673 --> 01:34:40,141
Will you come with me?

888
01:34:41,273 --> 01:34:42,991
I will.

889
01:34:46,633 --> 01:34:49,784
I will come back for you.

890
01:35:16,833 --> 01:35:21,668
Have you seen Cumali, my friend?
I can't find him, or his friends.

891
01:35:26,553 --> 01:35:29,226
Demircan's men took him away.

892
01:35:29,873 --> 01:35:32,751
It seems it's not only the police
he's in trouble with.

893
01:35:43,633 --> 01:35:45,828
Where is my stuff?

894
01:35:46,273 --> 01:35:49,982
You talked before you killed
the girl. You said you stole.

895
01:35:50,393 --> 01:35:55,308
Your closest friend told me.
Are they in this too?

896
01:35:55,553 --> 01:35:59,262
No. They know nothing.
I did it alone.

897
01:36:29,433 --> 01:36:32,186
You will either return the stuff,
or the money.

898
01:36:32,473 --> 01:36:34,543
I gave the money to the woman.

899
01:36:34,793 --> 01:36:37,546
Give me back my money!
Cut the crap!

900
01:36:37,833 --> 01:36:40,222
I killed two people.
They betrayed me.

901
01:36:40,513 --> 01:36:42,265
And you betrayed me.

902
01:36:43,553 --> 01:36:44,952
She conned me.

903
01:36:45,353 --> 01:36:49,744
What is it to me?
I want my money.

904
01:37:05,553 --> 01:37:06,781
What is it?

905
01:37:07,033 --> 01:37:09,547
-You have the boy.
-Yes, I have him.

906
01:37:09,913 --> 01:37:11,904
Let him go.

907
01:37:12,153 --> 01:37:16,829
Not before he pays me back.
It's not the money.

908
01:37:17,153 --> 01:37:22,386
We spend it in one night sometimes.
Our reputation is at stake here.

909
01:37:23,393 --> 01:37:25,588
You know these things. If you let
someone cheat you...

910
01:37:25,913 --> 01:37:28,586
it is bad for
your reputation.

911
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:32,542
If he is an upstart bastard like
this, it's worse.

912
01:37:32,793 --> 01:37:34,431
I can't let the
word get around.

913
01:37:34,833 --> 01:37:38,303
The police are after him. And he
was conned out of his money.

914
01:37:38,553 --> 01:37:41,829
Let me put it this way to you. If
he doesn't pay up, it won't

915
01:37:42,193 --> 01:37:44,229
be the police who pulls his rope.

916
01:37:44,633 --> 01:37:45,907
How much does he owe?

917
01:37:46,233 --> 01:37:47,552
Two hundred million.

918
01:37:47,993 --> 01:37:50,348
I'll pay you.

919
01:37:53,833 --> 01:37:56,028
Where will you find that kind of
money?

920
01:37:56,393 --> 01:37:59,305
The debt is my responsibility.
Leave the kid alone.

921
01:37:59,633 --> 01:38:03,672
This is between you and me.

922
01:38:05,033 --> 01:38:10,426
From now on, if something goes
wrong, you and I will talk.

923
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:17,105
Okay, bring the money and take
the kid.

924
01:40:14,313 --> 01:40:16,747
What is this? I want money.

925
01:40:17,193 --> 01:40:21,869
It is a cheque. It stands for
money. Just give it to them.

926
01:40:23,513 --> 01:40:28,348
You owed me a life.
You've settled your debt now.

927
01:40:33,113 --> 01:40:34,705
Keje?

928
01:40:38,633 --> 01:40:41,272
She stays.

929
01:40:44,113 --> 01:40:51,303
So it's Keje in return for a
kid's life. Keje for a life.

930
01:41:12,273 --> 01:41:14,468
Baran.

931
01:41:17,993 --> 01:41:24,432
I don't know how long I'll live
but I shall not give you up until...

932
01:41:24,793 --> 01:41:31,266
my last breath. I may yet...

933
01:41:38,393 --> 01:41:42,352
come back
to you, Keje.

934
01:41:45,993 --> 01:41:51,545
I'll keep silent Baran.
Until you return.

935
01:42:05,153 --> 01:42:10,466
Where did you get this cheque?
It's as good as gold.

936
01:42:11,633 --> 01:42:13,430
Return the boy.

937
01:42:14,473 --> 01:42:17,590
Go cash this at the bank.

938
01:42:24,313 --> 01:42:29,182
You go, I'll have a word with Cumali.

939
01:42:32,393 --> 01:42:35,942
Don't you ever cross my path again.

940
01:42:36,193 --> 01:42:38,468
Now, it's the police's
turn.

941
01:42:38,753 --> 01:42:46,990
Don't hide behind a poor old man.
One more mistake and I'll kill you!

942
01:42:48,393 --> 01:42:53,148
I won't even bother asking this
time. Now fuck off!

943
01:42:54,473 --> 01:42:57,112
Boy, we sure got fucked back there.

944
01:42:59,353 --> 01:43:03,710
The police, let's disperse. We'll
meet back at the neighbourhood.

945
01:43:34,393 --> 01:43:36,543
I am lost.

946
01:43:56,713 --> 01:44:00,865
Master Demircan has news for you.
The cheque bounced.

947
01:44:01,273 --> 01:44:04,902
Wha? What're you saying, brother?

948
01:45:03,313 --> 01:45:06,669
Bandit! Run!

949
01:45:07,353 --> 01:45:09,742
The police will be
here any minute. Cumali was shot.

950
01:45:09,993 --> 01:45:11,585
-Who shot him?
-Demircan's men.

951
01:45:11,833 --> 01:45:12,788
Why?

952
01:45:13,273 --> 01:45:15,946
Your cheque bounced. The guy
you got it from cheated you.

953
01:45:16,193 --> 01:45:17,751
We're all in trouble.

954
01:45:17,993 --> 01:45:20,188
-Where is Cumali?
-Must have run to the hotel.

955
01:45:30,433 --> 01:45:39,785
There is this warmth crawling up my
legs. What is it?

956
01:45:44,873 --> 01:45:50,345
You were shot often enough, Bandit.
You ought to know. Am I going to die?

957
01:45:53,393 --> 01:46:01,903
I remember my stepmother.
How she jumped off the roof in her...

958
01:46:02,193 --> 01:46:09,269
white dress. I thought she'd fly
away like a bird.

959
01:46:10,233 --> 01:46:13,225
But she hit the
ground like a rock.

960
01:46:20,793 --> 01:46:27,266
Then, I thought of Emel. She never
believed I could shoot her.

961
01:46:28,433 --> 01:46:34,702
Neither did I.
It all happened so fast.

962
01:46:45,033 --> 01:46:48,389
I will go to hell, won't I?

963
01:46:48,633 --> 01:46:51,830
Who knows where anyone goes?

964
01:46:52,073 --> 01:46:58,865
We were going to go where you
lived, to the mountains.

965
01:47:02,033 --> 01:47:08,063
I'm so scared. Don't leave me,
I'm scared.

966
01:47:19,513 --> 01:47:24,143
Don't be scared. You are only
going into earth.

967
01:47:24,393 --> 01:47:27,226
Then you will
be earth.

968
01:47:28,033 --> 01:47:35,713
Then you will flow with the waters
and become the sap of a flower.

969
01:47:37,833 --> 01:47:46,707
A bee will come to the sap.
And, perhaps, I will be that bee.

970
01:49:12,833 --> 01:49:19,671
The boy died. That thing you gave
me was a fake. Why?

971
01:49:22,353 --> 01:49:27,347
Remember we used to play stones as
boys?

972
01:49:27,753 --> 01:49:29,664
I used to beat you all the
time.

973
01:49:29,953 --> 01:49:35,710
You never asked why I always
won. I always cheated.

974
01:49:35,993 --> 01:49:41,590
You knew the boy would die.
Why did you do it?

975
01:49:41,833 --> 01:49:44,506
Why is the boy's death so
important?

976
01:49:44,753 --> 01:49:54,344
You sacrificed Keje to save the
life of a nobody.

977
01:49:57,033 --> 01:50:00,742
That woman has spent her whole life
waiting for you.

978
01:50:00,953 --> 01:50:05,344
What does life matter in the face
of love?

979
01:50:18,753 --> 01:50:24,350
True. What does life matter in the
face of love?

980
01:51:01,513 --> 01:51:03,708
I told you I would
answer for the boy.

981
01:51:03,913 --> 01:51:06,905
''You should talk to me if
anything goes wrong,'' I said.

982
01:51:07,233 --> 01:51:11,545
You didn't keep your promise.
You killed him. That won't do.

983
01:51:12,953 --> 01:51:14,944
You broke the agreement.

984
01:51:45,513 --> 01:51:46,992
Watch it, you bastard!

985
01:52:02,153 --> 01:52:03,825
Fuck...

986
01:53:54,753 --> 01:53:58,792
The motive behind one of the
bloodiest massacres in recent years

987
01:53:59,193 --> 01:54:00,945
is still unknown.

988
01:54:01,393 --> 01:54:03,953
Is there a connection between
the murder of Mahmut S,aholu

989
01:54:04,273 --> 01:54:07,231
and the slaughter of the drug
dealers?

990
01:54:07,553 --> 01:54:12,343
S,aholu's widow remains silent.

991
01:55:40,113 --> 01:55:45,426
We know where you are. Give
yourself up! You won't be harmed.

992
01:55:47,593 --> 01:55:53,748
Surrender! Hands on your head!
Or we shall open fire.

993
01:55:54,633 --> 01:55:56,669
I won't go back to jail.

994
01:55:56,953 --> 01:55:58,989
I can't stand being locked
up anymore.

995
01:55:59,273 --> 01:56:02,390
Surrender! Or we'll open fire!

996
01:56:45,873 --> 01:56:52,824
Once, I came face to face with a
wolf. I pointed my gun at her...

997
01:56:53,913 --> 01:56:56,985
and the wolf was growling.

998
01:56:57,193 --> 01:57:05,703
I thought, one of us will be dead
in a moment. A matter of strength.

999
01:57:09,353 --> 01:57:16,350
Go, you are too young.
It'd be a pity...

1000
01:58:14,353 --> 01:58:19,950
We don't want to harm you. This
is the last warning. Surrender.

1001
01:59:25,593 --> 01:59:30,144
I am coming, bandits!
I am coming.

1002
01:59:32,393 --> 01:59:35,430
Keje! Keje!

1003
02:00:46,113 --> 02:00:49,264
Goodbye, Bandit.

1004
02:00:57,833 --> 02:01:00,631
Ah! Bandit, ah!
