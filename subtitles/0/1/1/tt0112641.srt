[ Man Narrating ]
When you love someone,
you`ve gotta trust them.

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,100
There`s no other way.

4
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,700
You`ve got to give them the key
to everything that`s yours.

5
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,400
Otherwise, what`s the point?

6
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,000
And, for a while, l believed
that`s the kind of love l had.

Before l ever ran a casino,
or got myself blown up...

9
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,600
Ace Rothstein was a hell
of a handicapper, l can tell you that.

10
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,200
l was so good that whenever l bet,
l could change the odds...

11
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,100
for every bookmaker
in the country.

12
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,600
l`m serious,
l had it down so cold...

13
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,900
that l was given
paradise on earth.

14
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
l was given one of the biggest casinos
in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers...

15
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,200
by the only kind of guys that can
actually get you that kind of money...

16
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,900

17

18

[ Man #2 Narrating ]
Nobody knew all the details,
but it should`ve been perfect.

19
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,000
l mean, he had me, Nicky Santoro,
his best friend, watching his ass...

20
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,800
and he had, Ginger,
the woman he loved, on his arm.

21
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,600
But in the end,
we fucked it all up.

22
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,600
lt should`ve been so sweet too.

23
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,900
But it turned out to be the last time
that street guys like us...

24
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,700
were ever given anything
that fuckin` valuable again.

25
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,700
[ Ace ]
At that time, Vegas was a place
where millions of suckers...

26
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,600
flew in every year
on their own nickel...

27
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,100
and left behind
about a billion dollars.

28
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,700
But at night, you couldn`t see
the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.

29
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,500
But it`s in the desert where lots
of the town`s problems are solved.

30
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
[ Nicky ] Got a lot of holes
in the desert...

31
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,500
and a lot of problems
are buried in those holes.

32
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,400
Except you gotta do it right.

33
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,300
l mean, you gotta have
the hole already dug...

34
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,200
before you show up
with a package in the trunk.

35
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,000
Otherwise, you`re talking about
a half hour or 45 minutes of diggin`.

36
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,600
And who knows who`s gonna
be comin` along in that time?

37
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,400
Before you know it,
you gotta dig a few more holes.

38
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,000
You could be there
all fuckin` night.

[ Ace ] Who could resist?

43
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,800
Anywhere else in the country
l was a bookie, a gambler...

44
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,700
always lookin` over my shoulder,
hassled by cops, day and night.

45
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,000
But here, l`m Mr. Rothstein.

46
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,800
l`m not only legitimate,
but running a casino.

47
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,600
And that`s like selling people
dreams for cash.

48
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,800
l hired an old casino pal,
Billy Sherbert, as my manager,
and l went to work.

49
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,700
...the casino manager. And this is
Ronnie, who takes care of the card room.

50
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,500
[ Ace ] For guys like me,
Las Vegas washes away your sins.

51
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
lt`s like a morality car wash.

52
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,900
lt does for us what Lourdes
does for humpbacks and cripples.

53
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,200
And along with making us legit...

54
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,600
comes cash, tons of it.

55
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,400
l mean, what do you think we`re doing
out here in the middle of the desert?

56
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,400
lt`s all this money.

57
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,700
This is the end result
of all the bright lights...

58
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,700
and the comp trips,
of all the champagne...

59
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,300
and free hotel suites,
and all the broads and all the booze.

60
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,800
lt`s all been arranged
just for us to get your money.

61
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,800
That`s the truth about Las Vegas.

62
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,000
We`re the only winners.

63
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,900
The players don`t stand a chance.

64
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,200
And their cash flows
from the tables...

65
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,800
to our boxes
through the cage...

66
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,400
and into the most sacred room
in the casino.

67
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,500
The place where they add up
all the money...

68
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,900
the holy of holies,
the count room.

69
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,000
- Now, this place was off-limits.
- Verify 3,000.

70
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,900
Even l couldn`t get inside.

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,200
But it was my job to keep it filled
with cash. That`s for sure.

72
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,200
[ Nicky ] They had so much
fuckin` money in there...

73
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,900
you could build a house out
of stacks of hundred-dollar bills.

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,800
And the best part
was that upstairs...

75
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,000
- the board of directors didn`t
know what the fuck was going on.
- Five thousand.

76
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,400
l mean, to them everything
looked on the up-and-up.

77
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,300
Right? Wrong.

78
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,200
Verify 5,000.

79
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,200
- The guys inside the counting room...
- Five thousand.

80
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,000
were all slipped in there
to skim the joint dry.

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,100
They`d do short counts,
they`d lose fill slips.

82
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,500
They`d even take cash
right out of the drop boxes.

83
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,400
And it was up to this guy
right here...

84
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
standin` in front
of about two million dollars...

85
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,800
to skim the cash off the top
without anybody gettin` wise...

86
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,000
- the lRS or anybody.
- Verify 200.

87
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,100
Now, notice how in the count room
nobody ever seems to see anything.

88
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,400
Somehow, somebody`s always
lookin` the other way.

89
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,400
Now, look at these guys.
They look busy, right?

90
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,100
They`re countin` money.
Who wants to bother them?

91
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,600
l mean, God forbid they should make
a mistake and forget to steal.

92
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,000
Meanwhile,
you`re in and you`re out.

93
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,800
Past the jag-off guard
who gets an extra C-note a week...

94
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,400
just to watch the door.

95
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,200
lt`s routine. Business as usual:
in, out, hello, good-bye.

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,200
And that`s all there is to it.

97
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,400
Just another fat fuck walkin` out
of the casino with a suitcase.

98
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,400
Now that suitcase was goin`
straight to one place:

99
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,100
Right to Kansas City,
which was as close...

100
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,100
to Las Vegas as the Midwest
bosses could go...

101
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,400
without gettin` themselves arrested.

102
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,600
That suitcase was all...

103
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,500
the bosses ever wanted.

104
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,700
- And they wanted it every month.
- Hey, John, how was your ride?

105
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,500
Now this old Mormon fuck here...

106
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,800
he had to fly in with suitcases
once a month, nice and easy.

107
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,200
- Somethin` smells good.
- Yeah, they made us somethin` to eat.

108
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,400
The bosses would come
from all over the place:

109
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,600
Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee...

110
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,600
all over the Midwest.

111
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,500
And they would meet in the back
of this produce market in Kansas City.

112
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
l mean, nobody even knew it.

113
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,900
One of the guys made
his mother do all the cookin`.

114
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,100
- Do you ever see that guy
Jerry Steriano?
- Jerry Steriano?

115
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,500
Now, these old greaseballs

Mama, that man`s here again.

119
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,800
Because they control
the Teamsters Union.

120
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,600
And that`s where you had to go if you
wanted to borrow money to buy a casino.

121
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,800
- Would you put in shrimp?

their little suitcases.

125

Guys like this antique over here,
out of Detroit.

Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi,
the outfit`s top boss.

00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,800
You got a round figure on it?

128
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,700
- Definitely the most
important guy in this room.
- About 20 pounds.

129
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,000
- That`s around 700,000.

[ Ace ] As far as the world
was concerned...

134
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,700
Andy Stone, the head of
the Teamsters` Pension Fund...

135
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,600
- was a legitimate guy.
- This is a very auspicious occasion.

136
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,500
- A powerful man.
- Philip, if you would rise.

137
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,400
He even played golf
with the president.

On behalf of the Teamsters`
Pension Fund...

139

- it is my pleasure to present to you...
- But Andy also took orders.

140
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,200
And when he was told to give
a pension fund loan to Philip Green...

141
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,100
this check for $62,700,000...

142

for the new Tangiers.

143
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,500
he did what he was told.

144
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,500
[ Nicky ] Now, here was
the perfect front man.

145
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
What the fuck else could he be?
He didn`t know too much.

146
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,200
He didn`t want to know
too much...

147
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,900
especially that the bosses made
the Teamsters lend him the money.

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,600
He wanted to believe
the Teamsters...

149
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,200
gave him all that fuckin` money
`cause he was smart.

150
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,600
l know full well how much competition
we have in this great city.

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,900
Who the fuck knows?

153
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,300
All l know is that Green was
an Arizona real estate hustler...

154
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,300
who barely had
enough gas money...

155
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,400
to come and pick up
his own fuckin` check.

156
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,400
And of course it was
the bosses` man...

157
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,300
Andy Stone,
who gave all the orders.

158
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,700
Not the chairman
of the fuckin` board, Philip Green.

159
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,800
l understand.
l understand.

160
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,900
Now all they needed was...

161
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,900
somebody they could trust
to run the casino.

162
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,200
And who better than Ace? l mean, he was
already in Vegas a couple years...

163
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,200
and he had
the fuckin` place clocked.

164
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,800
But typical Ace, give him a shot
at runnin` a casino...

165
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,200
and he tries
to talk you out of it.

166
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,400
l don`t know if l could do this
even if l wanted to.

167
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,200
The Gaming Commission
would never give me a license.

168
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,600
l have at least two dozen
gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.

169
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,200
You don`t have to have a license
to work in a casino.

170
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,300
All you gotta do
is apply for one.

171
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,500
The state law says that
you can work in a casino...

172
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
while they`re processing
your application.

173
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,500
They got a ten-year backlog.

174
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,400
What happens when
they do find out?

175
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,400
Why would they
want to find out?

176
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,300
We`re puttin` a hundred million
into this desert.
Why would they want to lock us out?

177
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,000
They`ll never find out. All you gotta do
is keep changing your job title.

178
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,500
Like, uh, from Casino Executive
to Food and Beverage Chairman.

179
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,600
They take your application,
they put it at the bottom of the pile.

180
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,700
l know guys been workin` there
for 30 years, don`t have a license.

181
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,000
lt`s a tough proposition, Andy.

182
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,900
You know if l did it,
l`d have to run it my way.

183
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,700
You got it.

184
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,200
l`m serious, no interference.

185
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,400
Nobody`s gonna interfere
with your running the casino.

186
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,700
l guarantee it.

187
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,100
[ Nicky ] And that`s how
they got Ace to take over.

188
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,800
They wanted him because Ace ate,
slept and breathed gambling.

189
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,700
They worked out
a real cute job title too...

190
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,600
Tangiers Public Relations Director.

191
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,000
But the only thing he ever
directed was the casino.

192
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,200
He made his first bet when he was
15 years old, and he always made money.

193
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,700
But he didn`t bet
like you or me.

194
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,400
You know, havin` some fun
with it, shit like that.

195
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,400
Where the hell
did you learn how to deal?

196
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,200
He bet like a fuckin`
brain surgeon.

197
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,300
Place the checks properly.

198
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,200
- That`s the way you do it.
- Yes, sir.

199
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,000
He had to know everything,
this guy.

200
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,100
He`d find out the kind
of inside stuff nobody else knew...

201
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,800
and that`s what he`d put
his money on.

202
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,600
Even back home, years ago...

203
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,500
when we were first hangin` out...

204
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,100
he`d know if the quarterback
was on coke...

205
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,800
l`ll take Columbia for 20.

206
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,900
- if his girlfriend was knocked up.
- Twenty dimes on Columbia.

207
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,200
He`d get the wind velocity
so he could judge the field goals.

208
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,100
He even figured out
the different bounce...

209
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,000
you got off the different kinds
of wood they used...

210
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,900
on college basketball courts,
you know?

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,800
He`d be workin`
on this shit day and night.

212
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,000
There was nothing about a game
he was gonna bet that he didn`t know.

213
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,400
Ace got down at six.
Get me down at six.

214
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,100
Season after season...

215
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,700
the prick was the only
guaranteed winner l ever knew.

216
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,600
But he was so serious
about it all...

217
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,900
that l don`t think
he ever enjoyed himself.

218
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But that`s just the way he was.

219
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,700
But back then, the bosses
didn`t give a fuck...

220
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,700
about whether
he enjoyed himself or not.

221
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,600
To them, he was
a cash register.

222
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,300
All they had to do was
ring the bell and take money.

223
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,000
Especially Remo...

224
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,300
who was a fuckin` degenerate
gambler who always lost...

225
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,200
Cazzo!
[ Mumbles ln ltalian ]

226
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,800
All those fuckin` sweeps.

227
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,700
- unless Ace made his bets.
- Enough now!

228
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,700
Ace made more money
for them on a weekend...

229
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,700
than l could do heisting
joints for a month.

230
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,100
Whatever Ace picked up
on the street, he told Remo.

231
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,800
l mean, fixed fights,
doped horses...

232

crooked fuckin` zebras,
locked-in point spreads.

233
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,900
He told fuckin` Remo everything.

234
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And to tell you the truth,
l don`t blame him.

235
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
- Hey!
- Keepin` Remo happy with money...

236

Well, that`s why
they paid so well.

Never tells me nothin`.

No matter how big a guy might be,
Nicky would take him on.

You beat Nicky with fists,
he comes back with a bat.

You beat him with a knife,

301
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,900
 l got $700 

302
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,800
 Don`t you mess with me 

303
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,700
 But you know l`m down 

304
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,400
 Everybody knows l`m down 

305
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,900
[ Ace ] ln Vegas, l had to keep
a few juiced-in local cowboys working.

306
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,900
They were close to the,
you know, good old boys.

307
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,100
l mean, without us, these guys,
they`d still be shoveling mule shit.

308
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,000
Ward, you`ve got to keep
a cleaner space.

309
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
lf you need Mr. Clean,
page him, all right?

310
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,000
Won`t happen again, Sam.

311
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,500
- Mr. Rothstein.
- Mr. Rothstein. Won`t
happen again, Mr. Rothstein.

312
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,500
ls this guy just another dumb fucking
white man, or what? What`s the story?

313
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,900
- You need this guy.
- Can`t get rid of him?

314
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,400
He`s juiced in.
He`s the County Commissioner`s cousin.

315
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,400
l wouldn`t give the bum
a mop job.

316
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,900
But still, l had no choice.
l had to take care of them.

317
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,900
These yokels ran the state.

318
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,400
Thank you very much,
Senator.

319
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,500
- They passed the laws,
they owned the courts.
- Hi, Ace. Hey, l need a room.

320
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,100
- l had dozens of politicians
and state officials...
- The Cedar Room.

321
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,000
coming through that place
every week.

322
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,900
- Help the Senator,
get him whatever he wants.
- Certainly.

323
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,300
Why not make him happy?

324
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,800
...the Presidential Suite.

325
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,900
For politicians like our State Senator
up there, everything was on the house.

326
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,600
These guys won their comp life
when they got elected...

327
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,900
so, hey, why not
take advantage of it.

328
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,300
Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.

329
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,700
lt`s a whale
like K.K. lchikawa...

330
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,500
who plays $30,000 a hand
in baccarat...

331
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,500
that`s the one
you really gotta watch.

332
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,800
He plays fast and big
and he has the cash and the credit...

333
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,700
to turn out your lights.

334
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,600
About a year ago he cleaned out a couple
of casinos in the Cayman lslands.

335
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,600
Downstairs he takes us
for two million...

336
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,700
and upstairs he takes free
soap, shampoo and towels.

337
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,300
Another billionaire cheapskate
who loved his free rooms...

338
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,300
free private jets and
two million of our money.

339
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,700
But we got him back.

340
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,100
l had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz.

341
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,300
l don`t know what the hell went wrong.
l`m awfully sorry.

342
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,400
l can`t understand it. These mechanical
things, you know they happen.

343
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,900
Hey, but better here than
up there, you know what l mean.

344
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,400
Then he missed the commercial
flights connecting with Japan.

345
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,600
l can`t believe that there`s
a convention; there`s no room.

346
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,600
We got him back with a whole floor
of rooms to himself.

347
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,500
- l`m sorry you missed your plane.
- Glad to get to know you.

348
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,800
Oh, no. No gambling.

349
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,200
And once he was back,
he played small.

350
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,100
He bet 1,000 a hand,
instead of his usual 30,000 a hand.

351
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,900
...to the bank
with a natural lead over a five.

352
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But l knew the trick
with whales like lchikawa...

353
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,900
was that they can`t bet
small for long.

354
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,800
He didn`t think of it
as winning 10,000...

355
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,100
he thought of it
as losing 90,000.

356
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,900
So, he upped his bets.

357
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,800
Until he dropped his winnings back
and gave up a million of his own cash.

358
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,900
ln the casino, the cardinal rule
is to keep them playing...

359
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and keep them coming back.

360
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,400
The longer they play,
the more they lose.

361
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,600
ln the end, we get it all.

362
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,500
 Goddamn it
Trying to make it real 

363
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,400
 Compared to what 

364
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
 Sock it to me 

365
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,200
ln Vegas, everybody`s
gotta watch everybody else.

366
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,500
Six. All right,
who`s gonna give me that?

367
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,400
Since the players are looking
to beat the casino...

368
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,000
Each and every roll,
all right.

369
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,800
- the dealers are watching
the players...
- Six.

370
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,500
- Fake a six.
- the boxmen are watching the dealers.

371
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,300
the floormen are watching
the boxmen...

372
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,000
the pit bosses are watching
the floormen...

373
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,800
the shift bosses are watching
the pit bosses...

374
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,700
the casino manager is watching
the shift bosses...

375
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,900
l`m watching the casino manager...

376
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,000
and the eye in the sky
is watching us all.

377
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,100
Plus, we had
a dozen guys up there...

378
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,500
most of them ex-cheats, who knew
every trick in the house.

379
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,400
 Tryin` to make it real
compared to what 

380
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,700
Yes!

381
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,500
- Very nice.
- l told you l was hot tonight.

382
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,900
Lookin` good.
Lookin` good.

383
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,800
Let`s go.
This is for Ginger. Come on.

384
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,700
Let me have a hundred
on your hard ten.

385
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,700
Hundred on your hard ten.
Thank you.

386
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,100
Here we go now.
Yeeeow!

387
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,300
- Oh, l`m sorry.
- The dice--

388
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,100
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

389
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,600
- Thank you, sir. l appreciate it.
- You were great.

390
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,500
Thanks. Take care, Steve.
Take chances, drive fast.

391
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,700
This hundred is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.

392
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,300
- Come on.
- What`s the matter?

393
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,900
What do you mean? l made a lot
of money for you, l want my cut.

394
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,900
What money? l`ve seen
you stealing from me.

395
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,800
What money?
Look at the stack of chips.

396
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,100
- l want my half.
- l`ve been watching you all night.

397
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,500
- l want my money.
- Your bag is full of fucking chips.

398
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,200
- l didn`t steal anything from you.
- Get lost!

399
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,800
Get lost? Get lost?
Yes! Yes!

400
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,300
- Well, how about that?
- Come on!

401
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,500
 Slippin` and a-slidin` 
Changin` and a-hidin` 

402
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,800
 Been told a long time ago 

403
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,500
 l been told
Baby, you`ve been born 

404
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,700
 l won`t be your fool no more
Oww 

405
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,600
 Baby, oh, baby 

406
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,400
 My sweet baby 

407
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,600
 You`re the one 

408
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,900
[ Ace ] What a move.

409
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,800
l fell in love right there.

410
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,800
But in Vegas, for a girl
like Ginger, love costs money.

411
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,600
 What`s different about him 

412
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,200
 l don`t really know 

413
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
l`m gonna go powder my nose.

414
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,100
 No matter how l try 

415
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,700
 l just can`t make him cry 

416
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,600
- [ Ace ] Ginger`s mission
in life was money.
- l`ll be right back.

417
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,500
- See you, Ginger.
- Okay, thank you for asking.

418
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,200
She was a queen
around the casino.

419
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,900
She brought in high rollers...

420
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
and helped them spread
around a lot of money.

421
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
- Hello.
- Hey, Ginger. How you doing?

422
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,500
Great, and l have something for you.
You got me covered?

423
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,300
- And you do. Thank you very much.
- Take care of yourself.

424
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,900
- l got some lucky pills for you, Andy.
- Oh, yeah.

425
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,300
Who didn`t want Ginger?
She was one of the best known...

426
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,500
best liked and
most respected hustlers in town.

427
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,600
Smart hustlers like her
could keep a guy awake...

428
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,800
for two or three days
before sending him home broke...

429
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,900
to the little woman
and his bank examiners.

430
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,600
 You only make me glad 

431
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,600
 Better listen, little girl 

432
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,200
 You`re goin` walkin`
down the street 

433
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,800
 l ain`t got no love 

434
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,300
Any change?

435
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,100
Oh, l hit a few games
on the way back.

436
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,800
But that was all bullshit.
She just pocketed the cash.

437
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,200
 This heart of stone 

438
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,600
- How you doin` tonight?
- Good.

439
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,600
- How are you?
- Uh, beat.

440
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,100
- [ Ace ] Ginger had the hustlers code.
- Take one for you.

441
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,100
- Thank you.
- She knew how to take care of people.

442
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,600
And that`s what Vegas
is all about.

443
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,400
- Sixty-eight hundred.
- Thanks.

444
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,800
- lt`s kickback city.
- Have a good night.

445
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,600
Thank you. You too.

446
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,300
- She took care of the dealers...
- Hey, Mitch.

447
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,400
pit bosses, floor managers...

448
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,300
but, mostly, she took care
of the valet parkers...

449
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,700
the guys who could get you anything
and take care of anything.

450
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,400
Ginger took care of the parkers...

451
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
because they took care
of the security guards...

452
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,000
- who took care of the metro cops,
who let her operate.
- l need that stuff tonight.

453
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,300
- No problem.
- You are a doll.

454
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,200
The valet parking job
was such a money-maker...

455
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,800
they had to pay off the hotel manager
just to get the concession.

456
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,400
But one thing
l just could never understand...

457
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,800
was that she could have
everything under control...

458
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,900
except for her old pimp
boyfriend, Lester Diamond.

459
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,800
Gin, you know l got other people
in this, they got partners.

460
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,900
l want you to understand
that l am looking out for you...

461
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,800
in this thing, okay?

462
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,100
You`re gonna get yours back,
and you`re gonna get back first, okay?

463
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,300
- All right, yeah.
- Where you going?

464
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,600
Where are you? You`re
in that place. Where are you?

465
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,600
- l`m here.
- No, you`re not.

466
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,000
Where are you?
Where are you?

467
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,600
l`m always here for you.

468
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,400
- You`re my woman.
- l know.

469
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,300
[ Ace ] The Ginger l knew wouldn`t
even look at this creep.

470
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

471
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,300
He was a moocher,
a card cheat...

472
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,900
a country club golf hustler,
a scumbag.

473
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,500
- Chasing dentists for a few bucks.
- Careful.

474
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,900
The guy was always broke.
He always had a story.

475
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,400
And somehow she could never
turn him down.

476
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,200
The way Ginger saw it, l guess,
was that Lester was just an unlucky guy.

477
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,300
Somebody had
to take care of him.

478
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,200
But nobody
had to take care of Nicky.

479
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,100
lf you find any cash in there,
we`ll whack it up with you.

480
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,000
l mean, he took care
of himself only too well.

481
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,600
- That`s why every badge...
- l folded these things beautifully.

482
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,500
- back home wanted to nail him.
- l would appreciate a little respect.

483
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,400
- Look at me, pal,
l gotta live with her.
- Jesus Christ.

484
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,300
 Volare 

485
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,200
Even after a little vacation,
they hassled him at the airport.

486
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,800
l mean, Frank Marino was there
to meet him, but so were the cops.

487
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,000
This time they wanted
to pinch him...

488
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,100
- for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
- Will you help me fold these?

489
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,200
They were ready to blame him for
anything, no matter where it happened.

490
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,400
- Put your things away.
- And they were usually right.

491
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,900
- Hold it, hold it. Here.
- Because Nicky enjoyed
being a gangster.

492
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,100
- And he didn`t give a damn who knew it.
- Come on, there we go.

493
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,600
Look at this. Beautiful!

494
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,900
l mean, that`s what worried me.
`Cause it turns out,
Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.

495
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,600
- All right, we`re clear.
- There`s more.

496
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,800
There`s a couple stuck in there.
l know there`s more.

497
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,800
- l`m telling you, they`re out!
- Come on.

498
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,300
Don`t get so defensive,
it could be stuck in your hair.

499
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,500
What`s that?
Huh, what`s that?

500
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,000
There`s no more.
Thanks, hon.

501
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,900
[ Nicky ] l couldn`t wait to get
my hands on Vegas.

502
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,100
But the bosses didn`t send me
out there to have a good time.

503
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,400
They sent me out there to make sure
that nobody fucked with Ace.

504
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,300
And nobody interfered
with the fuckin` skim.

505
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,200
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doin`?

506
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,200
Hey, Sammy.

507
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,300
- Boy, look at this place, huh?
- lncredible.

508
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,500
Welcome to Vegas.

509
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
- Okay, Sammy.
- Something, huh?

510
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,700
Ginger.

511
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,900
Holy shit. What`ve you
been doing out here?

512
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,700
Honey, come here.

513
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,600
This is Jennifer and Nick,
they`re dear friends of mine.

514
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,000
- Hi, Jennifer.
- A pleasure.

515
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,000
Okay, Sammy.

516
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,800
[ Ace ] After we ate,
we left Jennifer and Ginger alone...

517
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,000
and we took a ride to talk.

518
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,000
And then, he hit me with it.

519
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,600
What do you think about me
moving out here?

520
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,000
What`s the matter?
You got a problem with that?

521
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,000
- No, of course not.
- You mean, l have your permission?

522
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,800
Sure, you have my permission.
But l just gotta tell you...

523
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,700
it`s no joke out here,
it`s no joke.

524
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,800
You gotta keep a low profile.

525
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,500
lt`s not like back home. Right off
the bat, they don`t like guys like us.

526
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,900
And this sheriff`s
a real cowboy.

527
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,800
Even the coppers aren`t afraid
to bury people out in the desert here.

528
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,300
l don`t care. l wanna get away
from back home for a while.

529
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,200
l`m tired of that shit
back there.

530
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,200
Look at this place.
lt`s made of money.

531
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,500
You know what the best part is?
Nobody`s gonna know what we`re doing.

532
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,400
There`s nobody here to see us.
Everybody`s back home.

533
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,500
Nick, l gotta tell you.
l got pinched twice for no reason.

534
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,400
l really gotta be careful.

535
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
l`m running a licensed place,
everything`s legit.

536
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,200
Don`t worry about it.
l`m not gonna do anything.

537
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,300
l`m especially not gonna
involve you in anything.

538
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,900
[ Nicky ]
Ace saw Vegas one way...

539
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,000
- You call this guy
and tell him l`m comin`?
- Of course.

540
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,700
but l saw it another.

541
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,000
l saw it as untouched.

542
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,000
l mean, they had bookies, pimps...

543
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
and drug dealers
l could shake down.

544
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,900
Who the fuck
were they gonna run to?

545
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,800
So l started gettin`
everybody in line.

546
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,400
Best of all,
for the first time in my life...

547
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,900
l figured out a way
not to lose.

548
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,100
[ Ace ] Yeah, he had
a foolproof scheme, all right.

549
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,100
lt wasn`t very scientific,
but it worked.

550
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,000
When he won, he collected;

551
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,600
when he lost, he told the bookies
to go fuck themselves.

552
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,900
What were they gonna do,
muscle Nicky?

553
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,400
- Hey, how you doin`?
- How you doin`?

554
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,600
- You got that thing for me?
- What thing?

555
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,700
Oh, Nicky. l thought
you was layin`.

556
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,400
No, no, l`m takin`.
l was takin`.

557
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,400
- You sure?
- l`m positive.

558
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,200
- l`m a little confused.
- You`re a little confused?

559
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,700
Maybe if l stick your fuckin`
face through this window...

560
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,700
you`ll get unconfused.

561
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,600
- Gimme the fuckin` money.
- l`m sorry, Nick.

562
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,500
l didn`t mean anything by it.

563
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,100
That`s why you had it ready.
You thought l was fuckin` layin` it?

564
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,600
- My fuckin` head.
- Smarten up.

565
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,300
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up
and tell us about our first president.

566
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,000
George Washington was born--

567
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,800
[ Ace ] But still,
it was nice and quiet for a while.

568
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,300
Ginger and l presented
Nicky and Jennifer all over town...

569
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,500
like regular Ozzie and Harriets.

570
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,500
Beautiful, you got
a beautiful swing.

571
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,000
[ Nicky ] Ace got my son, little Nicky,
involved in Little League.

572
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,700
Turned out to be one
of the other coaches...

573
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,800
was a fuckin`
metro intelligence cop.

574
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,800
But it didn`t matter.
lt was all about the kids.

575
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,100
He`s gotta realize that everything
can`t be a home run that he does.

576
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,100
That`s exactly what
l keep tellin` him...

577
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,600
but that`s the kind of kid he is.

578
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,600
[ Ace ] And Nicky being Nicky,
he made his presence known.

579
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,000
Especially at the casino,
where he definitely did not work...

580
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,300
people got the message.

581
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,300
[ Nicky ] Me, that`s why
the bosses sent me out here.

582
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,800
They wanted me to make sure none
of the other crews robbed the joint.

583
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,300
Like these two fuckin`
balloon heads over here.

584
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,000
They were gonna try to bang us
out of 200 fuckin` grand...

585
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,900
- yeah, right, l`m sure.
- Hey! How are you?

586
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,800
How are you?
What are you doing here?

587
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
l`m over here now.

588
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,300
- You`re over here?
- Yeah, l`m over here with them.

589
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,500
We`re waiting on Carmine.

590
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,400
Yeah, we`re looking
for Carmine.

591
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,900
He was here before. He had
a suitcase and then he left.

592
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,100
- Carmine left?
- Carmine left?

593
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,000
He`s gone?

594
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,900
He`s not here?

595
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,300
Carmine`s out?

596
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,500
l think maybe he went
across the street...

597
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,700
or somewhere else
or somethin`.

598
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,200
Well, listen, good luck
with the joint.

599

to open the fucking door.

Wanna come with us outside?

Bullshit. l ain`t goin`
anywhere with you.

- Bullshit. You`re outta here.
- Fuck you!

You know who you`re
fucking with? Do you?

00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,100
You fucking faggot! Do you know
who you`re fucking with?

Leave me alone!
[ Grunting ]

- Come on!
- You guys are killing me!

916
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,300
Sure enough, an hour later,
l get the call.

917
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,100
Ace, what happened over there?
Did you know that guy was with me?

918
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,200
No, l didn`t know that.
But you know what he did?

919
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,400
l walked over to him politely,
and he tells me to fuck myself.

920
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,100
- Then he called me a faggot.
- What?

921
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,400
- l threw that cocksucker out.
- Hey, come here.

922
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,200
You called my friend a faggot?
You tell him to fuck himself?

00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:53,400
- ls that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself?

[ Grunting Continues ]
Come here. Come here.

You go over there.
You apologize.

You better hope
he lets you back in.

00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,500
lf you get outta line again,
l`ll smash your head so hard...

to get that cowboy hat on.

Fuckin` hick.
Sammy, listen.

930
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,800
This guy obviously doesn`t know
who he was talking to.

931
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,300
He doesn`t know that
we`re dear friends.

932
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,500
l mean, he`s already
very sorry.

933
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,200
But if you could do me a favor
and let him back in...

934
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,400
l swear he`ll never
get out of line again.

935
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,800
lf he does it again,
he`s out for good.

l don`t care what it is,
l`ll never let him in the place again.

All right, Ace?
Thanks, pal.

 You`re dear to me
Yes, sirree 

945
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,400
[ Nicky ] You know,
Ace could be a very touchy guy.

946
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,700
Especially when
he got bigger in town.

947
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,700
Like when he hired
that Jonathan and David
and their tigers away from the Palace...

948
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,300
by building them a new stage
and giving them a Rolls-Royce.

949
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,000
But l`ll tell you, he knew
how to bring in the crowds.

950
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,100
He knew all
the fuckin` angles.

951
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,000
He brought over the whole
"Femme Fatale" show from Paris...

952
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,000
but he forgot how lazy them
European dancing broads can get.

953
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:16,200
He had to weigh `em in
once a week to make sure
they didn`t blow up like balloons.

954
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,100
She`s still eight pounds over.

955
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,200
- What`s the reason for this?
- Mr. Rothstein, sir.

956
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,400
Never mind the "sir."
Why is she eight pounds over?

957
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,500
l`m trying to use respect.

958
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,900
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.

959
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,600
Well, sometimes when you put
that pressure point on them--

960
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,600
All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.

961
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,300
l guess she`s frightened. lf she doesn`t
lose weight she may get fired.

962
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,300
That`s right, she will get fired.
Send her back to Paris--

963
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,900
- lt`s been our policy--
- Just stop everything!

964
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,100
- This woman`s an institution.
- That`s the problem. She`s lazy.

965
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,400
[ Nicky ] Hey,
l gotta give the guy credit.

966
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,600
l mean, he does
the most obvious thing.

967
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:54,000
This is the only town in the country
where a bookie joint is legit.

968
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,200
So why not take advantage, right?

969
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,800
So, he took bookie joints
off the street...

970
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,400
and then opened them up
inside the casino.

971
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,600
Within a few years
by doing all of this...

972
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:06,200
he had every casino on the strip
trying to copy off of him.

to put you in the Black Book.

That Black Book
is a bunch of bullshit.

from the whole country...

is still Al Capone.

What balls on this fuckin` kid!
The next day l fired him.

1026

And with Ginger happy, l was able
to concentrate on what l knew best.

- What about the progressives
with the high jackpots?

1036

- Well--
- These are our best machines.
They bring all the action.

1037

- No wonder the drop is off.
- Yeah, okay.

1038

- The action is in the front.
Bring `em up front.
- All right, l will.

three ways of doing things around here:

and the way that l do it.

00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,000
before what l was afraid
was gonna happen happened.

1053
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,800
Nicky managed to get himself banned
from every casino in Las Vegas.

1054
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,600
And from then on,
l couldn`t be seen talking
to him anywhere in Vegas or near it.

1055
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,500
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

1056
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,400
"He will be ejected from
any casino in Las Vegas.

1057
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:22,400
And the casinos can be fined
as much as $100,000...

1058
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,800
every time he shows up.``

1059
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,000
- You believe this shit?
- Yeah, l believe it. You got banned.

1060
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,400
"Because of notorious
and unsavory reputation--"

1061
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,100
Motherfucker!

1062
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,700
ls there any way
around this?

1063
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,400
No, there`s no way.

1064
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,400
Let`s say, for instance...

1065
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,900
l wanna go in a restaurant,
which happens to be in the casino...

1066
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,800
to get one of those
sandwiches l like?

1067
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:51,400
Forget it. You can`t even
set foot in the parking lot.

1068
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,800
That`s how serious it is.

1069
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:57,100
ln other words,
l`m fucked?

1070
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,400
ln so many words, yes.

1071
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,500
lt just didn`t sink into his head
about the Black Book and what it meant.

1072
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,300
Not being able to go
into a casino is one thing...

1073
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,800
but being in this book
etched your name into the brains
of every cop and FBl agent.

1074
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,400
l mean, you`re listed in there
with Al Capone. But Nicky didn`t care.

1075
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:18,000
l gotta do something.
They ain`t gettin` rid of me.

1076
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,700
They`re not gettin` rid of me.
l`m stayin` here.

1077
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,000
Fuck `em. Fuck `em.

1078
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,600
[ Nicky ]
So, once they pulled that shit...

1079
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,700
l started doin` my own things
nobody ever thought of doin`.

1080
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:37,500
To keep an eye on things,
l brought in my kid brother,
Dominick, and some desperados...

1081
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,400
and started knockin` over
high-rollers, casino bosses...

1082
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,100
bookmakers--
anybody right here in town.

1083
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,700
l had a good fuckin` crew goin`
for me, l`ll tell you that.

1084
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,300
l had Sal Fusco,
a great second-story guy.

1085
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:54,100
Jack Hardy. He worked for a safe company
before he did a six-year bit.

1086
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:58,700
And then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy can bypass any alarm for me.

1087
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,300
lt was like old times.

1088
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,800
And l opened up my own jewelry
store too, the "Gold Rush."

1089
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,100
Sometimes l used to go along
on a heist, just for the fun of it.

1090
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,000
But l didn`t like the people
l was rippin` off looking at me...

1091
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,700
so l used to turn
their fuckin` pictures around.

1092
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,600
- What`s takin` so long?
- This is a motherfucker!

1093
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,700
- lt`s working.
- Learn how to open these things
so you don`t have to take `em.

1094
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,500
Some of these stones
got a lot of niggers in them.

1095
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,900
Tell Pepe if he`s
switching stones on us,
he better take a camel back to Nigeria.

1096
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,200
- [ Phone Rings ]
- Yeah?

1097
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,400
- They`re in Penthouse K.
- Check in alone?

1098
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,500
- They checked in alone.
- Are they out now?

1099
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,300
- Yes. Don`t worry.
- All right. Thanks.

1100
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,000
[ Ace ] He had tipsters
all over town. Bellmen.

1101
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,600
- But you got to hurry.
- Yeah, okay.

1102
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,700
- Valet parkers.
- They`re just checking in now.

1103
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,600
Okay, l`ll tell him.

1104
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,600
- Pit bosses.
- Room 1230 at the Scirocco.

1105
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,500
- 1230. Right.
- Secretaries.

1106
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,600
- Mint condition coins.
- Mint condition? All right.

1107
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,000
And they all got
a piece of the score.

1108
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,800
Car`s coming.

1109
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,800
 [ Hard Rock ]

1110
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,900
They were very careful.

1111
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,400
They always bypassed
the alarms, or else...

1112
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,700
if not, they`d drill
enough holes to knock
through the walls with a sledgehammer.

1113
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,000
Nicky was grabbing
everything he could.

1114
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,600
Nobody out there was expecting
a guy like him.

1115
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,600
For Nicky, Las Vegas
was the fucking wild west.

1116
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,000
l just got a shipment
of diamonds from lsrael.

1117
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,800
[ Nicky ] What the fuck they expect
from me? l had to earn, didn`t l?

1118
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,100
You know, this diamond
has flaws in it.

1119
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,500
- There`s no flaws.
- l`m doing this for 25 years.

1120
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,800
You better clean your loupe,
because there`s no flaws.

1121
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,200
[ Nicky ]
Whenever we got local merch...

1122
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,300
we`d usually send it
to Palm Springs or Arizona, L.A.

1123
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,800
l had a couple of sand niggers
out there. You know, Arabs.

1124
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,300
What, are you gonna have
a fucking meeting here?

1125
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,500
l know his language.

1126
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,400
Forty thousand dollars.
The whole package.

1127
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,200
Twenty thousand.
That`s my final offer.

1128
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,700
He suddenly talks English. Let`s talk
Turkey here. Twenty-five thousand.

1129
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,500
[ Nicky ] l actually turned
my bedroom into a bank vault...

1130
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,000
where l kept
the choice stuff.

1131
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:05,400
l couldn`t leave it
at the Gold Rush...

1132
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,600
in case we got raided
by the cops...

1133
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,500
or if my crew got cute.

1134
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,400
l had the only key.
Jennifer didn`t give a fuck.

1135
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,200
She used to fall asleep
on the couch watching TV.

1136
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,800
This stuff was all mine.
l didn`t send any of this back home.

1137
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,000
Actually, l couldn`t, because l wasn`t
even supposed to be doin` it.

1138
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,800
The bosses were making so much
fucking money with the casinos...

1139
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,000
that they didn`t want anybody
makin` any waves for them.

1140
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,600
You gave all the guys
in your crew a piece of that?

1141
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,500
- l took care of everybody.
- Yeah?

1142
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,900
That`s why there was
no real organized street stuff
in Vegas before l came here.

1143
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,700
But how much cash
could l bury in my closet?

1144
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,100
You have to understand,
and l`m sure you do...

1145
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,200
that in a venture
of this kind...

1146
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,600
you have to be prepared
to take some kind of loss.

1147
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:50,600
So l put some of the money
into legitimate deals
with Charlie Clark, Ace`s banker.

1148
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:54,200
You will try to push it through,
won`t you, Mr. Clark?

1149
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,900
- Yes.
- l`m giving you 50,000 cash.

1150
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,200
Then l put some more money into
legitimate places, like my restaurant.

1151
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,100
- ls that the last one?
- Yeah.

1152
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,500
l had my kid brother,
Dominick, run it for me.

1153
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,400
Fuckers.

1154
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,000
- Here you go, guys.
- All right.

1155
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,300
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah. Enjoy. Have a good time.

1156
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,300
Choke on it, motherfucker.

1157
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,300
- Hey, Dom.
- How ya doin`?

1158
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,900
[ Ace ] Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.

1159
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,700
And over the years,
he always made money with it.

1160
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,000
ln Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
lt was a very popular spot.

1161
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:33,100
He had politicians, showgirls and movie
stars hanging out all over the place.

1162
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,400
That show over at the Flamingo
gets better and better.

1163
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,800
By the way, Sammy said, whenever
you have a minute, give him a call.

1164
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,800
- Made a messenger out of you too, huh?
- Anything for a buck.

1165
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,600
- He does it to everybody.
Enjoy your dinner.
- Thanks.

1166
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,200
[ Ace ]
But l gotta tell you, the thing Nicky
liked most was the showgirls, naturally.

1167
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,900
l mean, to them,
Nicky was the movie star.

1168
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,100
- You walk past me?
- Hey, this is Shelly.

1169
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,100
- Hey, Shelly. How are you?
- Hi.

1170
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,200
- And this is Stacy.
- Stacy.

1171
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,600
- This is Nick. Wanna have dinner?
- Pleasure.

1172
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,100
Let`s check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.

1173
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,900
Come on. l`ll show you.
l fly stuff in fresh every day.

1174
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,800
l get bread from back home.
l get fish from California.

1175
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:12,800
And you can always tell a great kitchen
like ours because of the milk-fed veal.

1176
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,800
That`s the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.

1177
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,300
Out here they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.

1178
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,900
Now, pink veal, you can pound
that shit for two days.

1179
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,400
lt`ll never, ever get tender.
You know what l mean?

1180
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:29,300
l left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.

1181
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,400
A couple guys, l owe them.
So l gave them the money.

1182
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,400
- That`s what l did.
- Yeah?

1183
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,700
- Yeah.
- You call yourself a man?

1184
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:41,300
You know you`re a lyin` lowlife,
motherfuckin` gamblin` degenerate prick?

1185
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,600
You know that`s what you are?
Two small kids at home.

1186
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,800
l gave you money to pay
the fuckin` rent...

1187
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,000
and buy groceries,
put the heat on.

1188
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:51,300
Your wife called Frankie and
told him the fuckin` heat`s off.

1189
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,500
And you didn`t gamble
that fuckin` money?

1190
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,400
- No? You didn`t?
- l didn`t--

1191
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,600
Don`t fuck with me, Al!
Don`t make a fuck outta me.

1192
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:02,100
You wanna embarrass me and make
a fool outta me? You didn`t gamble?

1193
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,300
Tell me you gambled
the fuckin` money...

1194
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,100
l`ll give you the fuckin` money
to put the fuckin` heat on!

1195
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,400
Did you gamble? Huh?

1196
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,600
Fuckin` degenerate.

1197
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,400
Fuckin` kids at home.

1198
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,700
Here. Get the fuck outta here.

1199
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,700
- Thanks, Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.

1200
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,400
Let me find out you fucked up.
l`ll leave you where l find you.

1201
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,600
How many of these
you gonna eat?

1202
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,500
- Two.
- Two?

1203
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,400
[ Ace ] But around 6:30 in the morning,
when he finished his day...

1204
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,800
no matter where he was
or what he was doing...

1205
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,800
he always went home to make breakfast
for his son, Nicky boy.

1206
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,600
l know you like this.
A little butter, right?

1207
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:45,300
- Not a lot. You know why, right?
- Yeah.

1208
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:48,200
- Why?
- `Cause it clogs up your heart.

1209
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:52,200
What a smart kid you are.
Okay, eat.

1210
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,900
[ Nicky ] Every couple of weeks,
l used to send Marino...

1211
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,700
back to the bosses
with a piece of what l made.

1212
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,900
Not a bit piece,
but what did they know?

1213
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,100
They were 1,500 miles away, and l don`t
know anybody who can see that far.

1214
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,100
Their drop was
a truck stop garage...

1215
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,100
where Remo and the guys used
to hang out and count their millions.

1216
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,000
- Remo.
- Hey, Frankie.

1217
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,600
The cops knew,
but they didn`t give a fuck.

1218
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,600
Nicky sends
his warmest regards.

1219
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,200
l knew how
to keep the bosses happy.

1220
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,400
Whenever they gave me
little jobs to do...

1221
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,700
l would carry things out
to a "T."

1222
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:26,800
Like the time Tony Dogs,
who`s supposed to be
the new maniac tough guy in town...

1223
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,200
shot up one of Remo`s bars.

1224
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,400
Here`s a fuckin` guy
kills two of Remo`s guys...

1225
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,700
and a poor fuckin` waitress who was just
workin` on her night off, of all things.

1226
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,000
l mean, this guy`s just beggin`
to be made an example of.

1227
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:49,600
Frankie, l want the names
of all the other people he had with him.

1228
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:52,900
And l don`t care what you have
to do to `em to get `em, understand?

1229
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
- l`ll take care of it, Remo.
- And mow `em down.

1230
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:58,200
[ Nicky ] To be truthful with you,
l had to admire this guy.

1231
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,000
He was one of the toughest
lrishmen l ever met.

1232
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,400
- [ Chattering ]
- This son of a bitch was tough.

1233
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,800
For two days and two fuckin` nights
we beat the shit outta this guy.

1234
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,200
We even stuck ice picks
in his balls.

1235
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,800
- Better give me a name soon,
or l`m gonna give him yours, Frank.
- Thanks a lot.

1236
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,900
- But he never talked.
- l know you would`ve ratted by now.

1237
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,500
ln the end, l had to put
his fuckin` head in a vise.

1238
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,200
Dogs, Dogs,
can you hear me, Dogs?

1239
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:24,100
Listen to me, Anthony.
l got your head in a vise.

1240
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,100
l`ll squash your fuckin` head like a
grapefruit if you don`t give me a name.

1241
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,400
Don`t make me have to do this.
Please. Come on!

1242
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,400
Don`t make me be a bad guy.
Come on.

1243
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,900
[ Straining ]
Fuck you!

1244
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
This motherfucker. You believe this?
Two fuckin` days and nights.

1245
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,500
Fuck me? Fuck me?
You motherfucker!

1246
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,300
Fuck my mother?
ls that what you`re tellin` me?

1247
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,200
- [ Skull Crunching ]
- You motherfucker, you! Huh?

1248
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,500
- Oh, God!
- Give me the fuckin` name!

1249
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,400
[ Straining ]
Charlie M.

1250
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,300
- Charlie M.?
- Charlie M.

1251
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,200
You make me pop your
fuckin` eye outta your head...

1252
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,000
to protect that piece of shit,
Charlie M.?

1253
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,000
You dumb motherfucker!

1254
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,100
Kill me, you fuck!
Kill me!

1255
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,400
You motherfucker, you!

1256
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,800
Frankie, do him
a fuckin` favor.

1257
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,200
[ Ace ] The word got around
that finally...

1258
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,100
there was a real
gangster in town.

1259
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,200
Nicky was the new boss
of Las Vegas.

1260
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,100
Charlie M.

1261
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,000
[ Bells Ringing ]

1262
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:25,200
Four reels, sevens,
across three $15,000 jackpots.

1263
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,600
Do you have any idea
what the odds are?

1264
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:30,000
lt`s gotta be
in the millions, maybe more.

1265
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:33,200
Three fuckin` jackpots in 20 minutes!
Why didn`t you call me?

1266
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:36,700
lt happened so quick. Three guys won.
l didn`t have a chance.

1267
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:40,300
- You didn`t see the scam?
- There`s no way to determine that.

1268
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,500
Yes, there is.
They won!

1269
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,500
lt`s a casino.
People gotta win sometimes.

1270
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,900
Ward, you`re pissing me off.
Now you`re insulting my intelligence.

1271
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,200
You know goddamn well somebody had
to get into those machines
and set those fuckin` reels.

1272
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:56,100
The probability on one machine
is a million and a half to one.

1273
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,600
On three machines in a row,
it`s in the billions.

1274
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,700
What`s the matter with you?

1275
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:05,500
Didn`t you see you were being set up
on the second win?

1276
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,700
l think you`re overreacting.

1277
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,900
Listen, you fuckin` yokel. l`ve been
carrying your ass ever since l got here.

1278
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,300
- Get your ass outta here.
- You`re firing me?

1279
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,700
l`m firing you.
No, l`m not firing--

1280
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,000
- You might regret this.
- l`ll regret it if l keep you.

1281
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,300
This is not the way
to treat people.

1282
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,400
lf you didn`t know,
you`re too fuckin` dumb.

1283
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,800
lf you did know,
you were in on it.

1284
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:29,100
Either way, you`re out.
Get out. Come on. Let`s go.

1285
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,100
The guy`s history
as far as l`m concerned.

1286
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,500
But you can`t fire him. His
brother-in-law is County Commissioner.

1287
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:40,600
Everybody with cowboy boots is
a fuckin` county commissioner
or related to a commissioner.

1288
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,800
This is his state.
His uncle`s chief judge.

1289
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,200
His brother-in-law runs
the county commission.

1290
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:48,100
You`re in the finances,
you`re upstairs.

1291
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,900
But you are not on the floor.
You don`t see what`s going on.

1292
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,700
l`ve got thousands of players.
l`ve got 500 dealers.

1293
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,300
They`re all looking
to rob me blind 24 hours a day.

1294

l have to let them know l`m watching
all the details all the time.

1295
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:03,400
There is not one single thing
l will not catch.

1296
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,200
- Look at yours. Look at that.
- Huh?

1297
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,900
Look at this.
There`s nothing.

1298
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,300
Look how many blueberries
your muffin has.

1299
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,700
What are you talking about?

1300
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,100
lf you don`t do it yourself,
it never gets done.

1301
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:19,600
- Where are you going?
-  How long can this go on 

1302
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,700
From now on, l want you to put an equal
amount of blueberries in each muffin.

1303
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,500
An equal amount of blueberries
in each muffin.

1304
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,000
Do you know how long
that`s going to take?

1305
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:32,800
l don`t care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.

1306
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:40,300
Just a little.
That a girl.

1307
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,700
Oh, boy, look.
You wanna go to Mommy?

1308
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,600
Wanna come to Mommy?
lt`s all right, sweetheart.

1309
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:49,400
l need to talk to you.
l need some money.

1310
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,800
- What do you need?
- Got her?

1311
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:56,500
Well, l need a lot.
l need more than usual.

1312
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,800
Why don`t you take it
out of your account?

l would, you know, Sam,
it`s just that--

1314
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,800
Well, l need more than that.
l need $25,000.

1315
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:08,900
Twenty-five thousand?
For yourself?

1316
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
- Yeah.
- Why do you need that much?

1317
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,900
What`s the difference?
l just need it.

1318
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,900
Well, l gotta ask you.
That`s a lot of money.

1319
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,900
You`re not asking
for a box of popcorn.

1320
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,400
We don`t have to turn this
into a big deal.

1321
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:24,100
Okay? We don`t have
to have a fight.

1322
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,800
lt`s important to me.
Just something l wanted to do.

1323
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:30,700
Who`s fighting?
l mean, tell me what it`s for.

1324
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,400
Why can`t you tell me
what it`s for? Huh?

1325
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,100
Well, you know what?
Now l want you to tell me.

1326
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:45,600
My wife comes to me and asks me
for 25,000. What do you want, a coat?

1327
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:48,200
- No.
- lf you want a coat, you got it.

1328
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:52,400
lt`s not the money.
lt`s just, why do you want it?
Am l not entitled to ask that?

1329
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,500
Sam, l`ve been independent
my whole life. l never had
to ask anybody for anything.

1330
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,500
- Now you`re making me beg.
- What are you talking about?

1331
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,000
And you`re embarrassing me.
Why do you want to make me feel so bad?

1332
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:06,000
You`re asking me for 25,000.
l`m not out to make you feel bad.

1333
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
l want to just
be able to trust you.

1334
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,900
You know,
it`s about trust.

1335
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,800
l have to be able

until his own lawyers

Maybe he could run things with another

However he runs things,

from Nicky wasn`t easy.

there could have been a hole.

druggies and bikers in L.A.

2884
02:38:21,300 --> 02:38:24,800
ln a few months, they went through
all the money and all the jewels.

[ Gasps ]

2887
02:38:49,100 --> 02:38:51,700
[ Ace Narrating ]
After they found her body...

2888
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:54,900
l had a private doctor
do another autopsy.

2889
02:38:57,400 --> 02:39:00,400
He said they gave her
a hot dose.

2890
02:39:00,500 --> 02:39:06,100
ln the end, all she had left was 3,600
in mint condition coins.

2891
02:39:26,100 --> 02:39:30,200
No matter what the Feds or the papers
might have said about my car bombing...

2892
02:39:30,300 --> 02:39:32,900
it was amateur night,
you could tell.

2893
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:37,200
Whoever it was, they put
the dynamite under the passenger side.

2894
02:39:37,300 --> 02:39:40,700
But what they didn`t know,
what nobody outside the factory knew...

2895
02:39:40,700 --> 02:39:45,800
was that that model car was made with
a metal plate under the driver`s seat.

2896
02:39:45,900 --> 02:39:48,600
lt`s the only thing
that saved my life.

2897
02:40:00,200 --> 02:40:04,200
The bombing was never authorized,
but l suspect l know who lit the fuse.

2898
02:40:04,700 --> 02:40:07,000
- [ Man ] Hey, Nicky.
- [ Ace Narrating ]
And so did the powers that be.

2899
02:40:07,100 --> 02:40:09,600
- How are you?
- How you doin`?

2900
02:40:09,700 --> 02:40:11,500
[ Nicky Narrating ] lt took months
for everything to calm down.

2901
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:13,400
But, finally,
my guys got out on bail...

2902
02:40:13,500 --> 02:40:17,200
and the bosses wanted me to send
my brother Dominick out to Vegas.

2903
02:40:17,300 --> 02:40:19,500
Always the dollars.
Always the fuckin` dollars.

2904
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:23,900
l mean, it was still way too hot
for me to even go near Vegas.

2905
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,800
So l set up a meeting
with the guys way out in the sticks.

2906
02:40:26,900 --> 02:40:29,800
l didn`t want my brother to get fucked
around. l mean, what`s right is right.

Frankie, leave the kid alone.
He`s still breathing.

He`s still breathing.

The bosses had enough of Nicky.
They had enough.

2934
02:42:19,500 --> 02:42:24,900
How much were they gonna take? So they
made an example of him and his brother.

2935
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:28,400
- [ Gasping ]
- They buried them

Watch out!

The town will never be the same.

After the Tangiers,
the big corporations took it all over.

Today it looks like Disneyland.

what you drank, what you played.

 Beside a garden wall

 When stars were bright

 And you were in my arms
