1
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,711
I have lived through many ages ...

2
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,289
through the eyes of salmon,

3
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:19,171
deer,

4
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:21,598
and wolf.

5
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:29,450
I have seen the North Men invading Ireland
destroying homes, in search gold.

6
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,634
I have seen suffering in the darkness,

7
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:54,885
yet ... I have seen beauty
thrive in the most fragile of places.

8
00:01:57,559 --> 00:02:03,559
I have seen the book ... the book
that turned darkness into light.

9
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,625
<i> The Secret of Kells </i>


10
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:26,000
Brendan? Don't let her get away!

11
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,640
Come on! Nice goosy, goosy, goosy ...

12
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:45,366
Stand back, I will get her!

13
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,646
Which way?

14
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,016
Brendan! That scaffolding is not steady!

15
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:20,073
Don't worry, brother Assoua, I'll be careful.

16
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,946
Sorry.

17
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,872
Brendan!

18
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:42,797
Coming!

19
00:03:51,224 --> 00:03:52,226
Brendan!

20
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:54,426
Are you hurt?

21
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,522
Keep it quiet, Brendan!
Or the abbot will hear.

22
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:36,148
I'm sorry, but we have to do this.
It will all be over in a minute.

23
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:41,943
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?

24
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:44,765
Lucky bird.

25
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Your feathers will become the tools
from which we create immortal pages
of sacred text.

26
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:08,436
Abbot! I explain for you ...

27
00:05:08,437 --> 00:05:12,413
We tried to catch goose ... 
and she run very fast.

28
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,355
And I fall in the mud ...

29
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:17,814
Forgive us, abbot.

30
00:05:17,823 --> 00:05:20,335
Brendan! Where are those
plans I asked for?

31
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:24,150
The plans ... I left them in the
scriptorium.

32
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:26,563
- Bring them to the tower
- Yes uncle.

33
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:31,753
Tomorrow, you will go back to work on the wall.
Dawn t'll evening bell.

34
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:33,924
and brother Leonardo ...

35
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:37,740
... clean yourself up for pity's sake.

36
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:49,158
I do not know why there are at it this intense
when all that man wants us to do is to build his crazy wall.

37
00:05:49,193 --> 00:05:54,373
Yes, that's all the man cares about, nothing else,
and you continue to defend him, Brendan!

38
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:57,159
Uncle just wants to protect us from outside.

39
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,296
When the North Men come to Kells, they'll make no distinction
between young and old. So ...

40
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:04,492
"Prepare or meet your doom!"

41
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,215
You just don't understand ...

42
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:15,132
But Brendan, you've never been outside these walls.

43
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,693
I don't have to go outside to know how dangerous it is.

44
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:22,923
- Where have you all been?
- We went to get these, for you.

45
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:25,762
You should have seen brother Sergey,

46
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:28,718
he took a flying dive,
like a beautiful swan.

47
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:30,991
It is not funny.

48
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:35,419
The abbot has seen us, he is not happy
because we are not work on the wall.

49
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:40,453
Now enough of that! What about the books?
Does he not find them?

50
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:45,453
If there were no books, all knowledge
would be lost ... for ethernity.

51
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,469
We cannot only build walls.

52
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:50,617
The people must have books,
so that they may have hope.

53
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:53,776
If we had a true master illuminator
would would do so much splendid work!

54
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,900
Let us pray that one will be delivered to us
one day.

55
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:58,048
Let us Pray!

56
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:02,405
Surely you don't need a master,
your work is the finest I've seen ...

57
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,738
Thanks Brendan, but
we are mere scriblers...

58
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:09,463
- next to true masters.
- True masters? Such as ...

59
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:13,716
Brother Aidan of Iona.

60
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:15,733
He is indeed the great one.

61
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,716
Who is the brother Aidan?

62
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:19,022
A sage.

63
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:21,129
The wisest one of them all.

64
00:07:21,164 --> 00:07:23,201
The perfect Illuminator.

65
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:24,279
Well where is he then?

66
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:27,052
He lives on a tiny island called Iona.

67
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:33,917
There is an abbey on the island, where he works
on a magnificent book: The Book of Iona.

68
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:43,184
The book was begon 200 years ago, under the
orders of none other than Saint Columb Kil himself.

69
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:47,574
The Book of Iona outshines
all others

70
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:49,870
because of the miracle of 
Columb Kil's third eye

71
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:55,381
No, not because of his third eye, because of his
three hands with 12 fingers on each.

72
00:07:55,484 --> 00:07:58,347
That's not true! He had a third eye,
not a third hand!

73
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:00,624
Have you not heard of the eye
of Columb Kil ?

74
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:04,179
Ofcourse! But that was for 
making the prophecies

75
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:07,699
His third hand was 
for beginning the book.

76
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,960
Enough! Just tell us about
Brother Aidan.

77
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:16,220
His writings are said to glow from the pages,
as though they are light.

78
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,310
Sinners have been blinded
while glansing upon the pages.

79
00:08:20,345 --> 00:08:23,499
For to gaze upon the book, is to gaze
upon the heavons itself!

80
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:25,610
The Book of Iona.

81
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,445
But where is Iona?

82
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,786
It is far far away in the sea. Like all
islands should be.

83
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:35,196
A beautiful place

84
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:39,092
where the illuminators
do not have to build walls.

85
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:45,092
But the abbot sais that
islands are too easy to attack.

86
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:59,299
Brendan! Are you still here?

87
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,611
You'd better bring the abbot those plans,
or you'll be in big trouble!

88
00:09:02,612 --> 00:09:03,612
Uncle!

89
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:05,217
Hurry boy!

90
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:15,476
Here they are uncle.

91
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:21,437
Brendan! How am I to trust you with responsablity 
when you continue to disappoint me?

92
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,712
One day you will take controle of this Abbey.

93
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:28,734
Yet it takes you several hours to fulfill
a simple task.

94
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:29,997
I'm sorry.

95
00:09:30,032 --> 00:09:35,370
The monks were talking about Iona.
I dreamt it was destroyed.

96
00:09:35,405 --> 00:09:37,620
It was so real uncle!

97
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:40,658
It is real Brendan.

98
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:45,180
One day that horror will come to us.

99
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,710
That is exactly why we must prepare
ourselves.

100
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:11,368
This section of the wall is supported by
three pillars: here, here and here.

101
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,075
Uncle, someone has arrived!

102
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,717
He has a white cat!

103
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:19,213
Another victim of the North Men no doubt.

104
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:21,073
Let's see.

105
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:34,496
<i> * crowd talking * </i>

106
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:39,799
Oh, no, no ... not that far.
But we've legs walked ourselves all the way.

107
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,528
But please, from where?
A very long way?

108
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:47,261
Oh yes, it was long enough alright.

109
00:10:47,262 --> 00:10:49,563
but when you just want to keep up with,
the road just takes half the time.

110
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,045
Isn't that right Pangur Ban?

111
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:57,689
Welcome to Kells, brother.

112
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,242
- Abbot Cellach
- Peace be with you!

113
00:10:59,277 --> 00:11:04,410
Brothers,  welcome to Kells
one of the great illuminators of our times.

114
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:06,572
Must be a mistake.

115
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:08,699
Brother Aidan of Iona.

116
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:15,732
One question at a time.

117
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:21,767
As Columb Kil used to say: "Questions do not burn
your tongue if you wait to ask them"

118
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,406
Welcome to Kells, brother Aidan!

119
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:27,300
Just this way, brother.

120
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,755
Hello! Welcome to Kells!

121
00:11:37,286 --> 00:11:38,800
Hey, wait!

122
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:45,761
<i> just talking of you and of the book. </I>

123
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,039
Fine size of a place, isn't it?

124
00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:55,679
Good clean air, bright light coming
from those windows ...

125
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,091
Brother!

126
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,961
Is that where you keep the book?

127
00:12:02,574 --> 00:12:06,684
Is ... that where... you keep... the..

128
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,016
And who might you be?
A very short brother I see.

129
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,799
Although short of stature is never as short
of questions.

130
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,996
And of what interest is the book to you?

131
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:24,127
Well ... the brothers where talking, and they said
that Saint Columb Kil himself began s...

132
00:12:24,162 --> 00:12:29,630
Brothers, the brother of Aidan
must come with me

133
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:35,099
I must take him to see the important work
we are doing to fortify Kells.
You all have work to do.

134
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,167
The plans are in my work room.

135
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:40,462
- Ah see, I was thinking, I could stay here
and ... -Right this way, brother.

136
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:45,229
Lad! Find some food for a...

137
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,873
You see, I am determined to complete the fortifications
within two years.

138
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:52,482
So, you're Pangur
Ban. Well I'm Bre ...

139
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:55,572
Hey! Wait! I'm supposed to feed you

140
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,960
Wait!

141
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,628
Pangur Ban!

142
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:05,170
Pangur Ban!

143
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,593
You shouldn't have come here.
The North Men will have followed...

144
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:10,937
"Did I have to stay, to be killed?

145
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:15,030
I escaped the Vikings and left them far behind.
Brother Cellach

146
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:18,226
Sorry, I mean ... abbot Cellach.

147
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:21,574
The book is saved, and I need to completed.

148
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,385
Yes, well ... we have more pressing things 
to complete here.

149
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,518
- You mean your wall?
- Not my wall, Aidan!

150
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:33,617
A wall to save civilization.

151
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:35,812
A wall to save your book!

152
00:13:37,646 --> 00:13:38,791
Pagens ...

153
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,780
Crom worshipers...

154
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,800
It is with the strenght of our walls, that they will 
come to trust the strenght of our faith.

155
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,698
You were always good at the old drawing, Cellach.

156
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:56,767
Yes, well if you'd excuse me... 
I have a lot to attend to.

157
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:01,360
No wall can stop the North Men, abbot.

158
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:03,932
When they come, all we can do is run

159
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:07,361
and hope that
are we're fast enough.

160
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,039
Come on Pangur.

161
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,900
Pangur!

162
00:14:51,906 --> 00:14:54,164
I don't mean the book any harm.

163
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:57,223
All I've ever seen is inside the walls of Kells.

164
00:14:57,258 --> 00:15:00,106
If I could just see one page

165
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,315
Please.

166
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,449
Well!

167
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:12,322
If it isn't the little brother with
the big questions?

168
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:14,558
- I didn't mean to ...
- I understand.

169
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:20,593
You got bored eavesdropping on the abbot's private conversation
and decided to rummed through my things.

170
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,683
Oh, no, that's not it!

171
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:25,594
Calm down lad, I won't tell on ya.

172
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,509
Maybe I ...

173
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,299
The brothers said that sinners are
blinded if they glassed at the book.

174
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,745
So maybe I shouldn't

175
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,659
Is that what you really believe what happened?

176
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,299
There's nothing in this life but mist, is there lad?

177
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,880
It's your decision, no one else's.

178
00:15:53,795 --> 00:15:57,855
The cover is not the real treasure. Open it!

179
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,503
The work of angels.

180
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:10,987
"The work of the angels"
Did you hear that, Pangur?

181
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,813
I didn't know that angels would be
as funny looking as me.

182
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:17,964
Maybe it's the boy has gone blind.

183
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,630
I thought the very same,
when I first saw it.

184
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:27,317
But it is only the work of
mere mortals I'm afraid, like me or you.

185
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:31,488
The book is a beacon in these dark days
of the North Men.

186
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:34,881
Do you want to see the most beautiful page?

187
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:39,681
The one that will turn darnkess into light?

188
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,991
It is to be, the "Chi Ro" page.

189
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:51,765
But it hasn't been made yet.

190
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,129
No, but it will become the most glorious page 
of the entire book.

191
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,765
Tell me Brendan, would you like to help?

192
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,058
Oh yes, please! I help the brothers
find quills all the time.

193
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:04,256
Calm down, calm down, little brother.

194
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:09,796
Now to start with, you can help me gather some of these,
from an old oak tree.

195
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:11,198
What is this?

196
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:16,630
It's a humble little berry, but it makes the 
deepest emerald green ink you'll ever see.

197
00:17:16,631 --> 00:17:22,631
If you help me get a dozen or so from the forest
I'll show you how to make it, so, come on!

198
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,334
What's keeping you?

199
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:32,063
I can't go. I'm not allowed to go outside the wall.

200
00:17:32,463 --> 00:17:34,505
It's too dangerous.

201
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:37,473
It is, dangerous.

202
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,367
Iona

203
00:17:40,402 --> 00:17:44,488
I lost my brothers to attackers 
from the outside.

204
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:48,161
Now I have only the book to remember them by.

205
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:54,162
But if my brothers where here now
they would tell you you'll learn more in the woods

206
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,095
from trees and rocks
than from any other place.

207
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,715
You'll see miracles.

208
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,586
And that is something the abbot knew, a long time ago.

209
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,799
I've never seen anything like it, Pangur.

210
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,643
I really want to
help brother Aidan.

211
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:26,084
I think I could get
those ink berries all by my self.

212
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:30,525
I could go into the forest.
wouldn't brother Aidan be surprised ...

213
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:32,405
But the abbot ...

214
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,495
I'll be back before he'd even missed me.

215
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,020
But .. What if I get lost ...

216
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:39,223
... in the dark?

217
00:18:39,224 --> 00:18:42,662
No! I should never go out there!

218
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,450
if I keep thinking
of the book

219
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:53,137
I won't be afraid of the dark.

220
00:18:53,138 --> 00:18:56,226
And I'm sure I won't have to go that far.

221
00:18:56,261 --> 00:19:01,419
Alright so, Pangur Ban.
Tomorrow I'll go into the forest!

222
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:20,963
Pangur!

223
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:46,287
Ofcourse, it might help if I knew what
an oak tree looked like.

224
00:21:03,427 --> 00:21:07,052
Maybe we'd better go home...

225
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,312
Was it this way? Do you remember?

226
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:20,816
Don't panic, Pangur. We just have
to find the way back before dark.

227
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:35,894
Ow no, it's hard enough...

228
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:37,699
Is this your cat?

229
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,725
Well?

230
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,521
I've heard about creatures like you

231
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:50,760
You're a fairy!

232
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:57,567
What are you doing in my forest?
You've come to spoil it, haven't you?

233
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:03,800
You were probably sent here by your family,
to get food, weren't you?

234
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:07,720
Well, you can go right back where you came from.

235
00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:11,291
If you don't, I'll make the wolves get you!

236
00:23:11,326 --> 00:23:12,291
No!

237
00:23:14,016 --> 00:23:17,639
I didn't mean to ... Look, I'm sorry alright?

238
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,050
I'm not here to get food for my family. 
I 'm here to get things to make ink.

239
00:23:21,085 --> 00:23:24,442
I don't have a family, and we
have food in Kells.

240
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:27,799
So I wouldn't come here for it anyway.
I was just a bit lost.

241
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:30,089
You have no family?

242
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,184
No.

243
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:34,219
No mother?

244
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:39,600
I'm alone too.

245
00:23:41,556 --> 00:23:44,605
If this is your forest, you must 
know everything about it.

246
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,745
Well, of course.

247
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,039
No Wait!

248
00:23:47,074 --> 00:23:48,298
Hello?

249
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,084
Shhh...not so loud! Go away!

250
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,542
No wait Please! Do you know where
you can find these?

251
00:23:56,543 --> 00:23:58,220
Yes

252
00:23:58,255 --> 00:23:59,840
But you can't eat those.

253
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:03,980
I don't want to eat them, they're for ink.

254
00:24:06,286 --> 00:24:08,291
What is ink?

255
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:10,953
It 's for the book ...

256
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:12,243
For make pictures.

257
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:15,938
Liquid colour, you put it on pages...

258
00:24:15,973 --> 00:24:20,060
like leaves ... it's hard to explain,
I suppose you'd have to see it.

259
00:24:20,095 --> 00:24:24,147
I do not know what you're talking about,
and I don't want to know ...

260
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:25,468
But.. brother Aidan ...

261
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:29,430
I will help you find the things you want, 
on one condition ...

262
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:36,109
You and your pet must promise
to never come into my forest again.

263
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,179
Alright then. We promise.

264
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:47,934
Come on then, I'll ask the forest where they are.

265
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:51,270
Ask the... what ...?

266
00:24:51,305 --> 00:24:53,045
Hey, wait!

267
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,425
My name is Brendan. What's yours?

268
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,899
It's a miracle, just like Aidan said.

269
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,100
Aidan is my friend.

270
00:25:11,101 --> 00:25:15,526
I'm helping him make the most incredible
book in the whole world.

271
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:20,719
He sais it'll turn darkness into light.
Wait until you see it!

272
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,115
Wait until you see the rest of my forest!

273
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,081
You're fast.

274
00:25:39,116 --> 00:25:42,456
Yes, I'm the fastest.

275
00:25:42,695 --> 00:25:43,695
So ...

276
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:46,294
Where are the berries then?

277
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,339
You have climbed a tree before, haven't you?

278
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,326
Yes, of course. It's easy.

279
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:01,103
Come on so!

280
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,926
Saved your life, second time today.

281
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:37,049
I thought you knew how to climb trees.

282
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,263
I do. Smaller ones.

283
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,693
Yeah ... like bushes.

284
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:45,207
Don't look down. Come on!

285
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,905
Look!

286
00:26:56,724 --> 00:26:59,729
One beatle recognizes another.

287
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:27,665
Come on!

288
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,165
Open your eyes and I'll tell you my name.

289
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,946
Aisling.

290
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:43,370
and this, is my forest.

291
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:56,674
I asked them not to sting you.

292
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,904
Here's what you're looking for ...

293
00:27:58,905 --> 00:28:02,055
... but they're not really berries.

294
00:28:02,225 --> 00:28:04,298
They look like boar droppings.

295
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,207
They're kind of stinky too.

296
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,081
If you're finished, It's time to go back down.

297
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,282
back down ...

298
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,999
A bit left.

299
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,999
No wait! Don't lean on that ...

300
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,286
... branch.

301
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:28,629
I'm sorry it took so long to come down.

302
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,438
Except for the last part ...

303
00:28:30,473 --> 00:28:34,599
We'd better go now. I know a secret way to get you home

304
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,761
Come on!

305
00:28:43,808 --> 00:28:45,430
Look!

306
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:49,100
Brendan?

307
00:29:04,856 --> 00:29:07,386
What are you doing? Come away!

308
00:29:09,418 --> 00:29:11,663
This is a place of suffering.

309
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:14,389
Suffering? What do you mean?

310
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:17,899
Just come away! It's too dangerous.

311
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:21,132
Surely it can't be more dangerous
than climbing an oak tree.

312
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:24,000
It is the cave of the Dark One.

313
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:25,478
Crom Cruach?

314
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,713
But Crom Cruach's only a story for children.

315
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:32,813
The Abbot of Kells, says you shouldn't
be afraid of imaginary things.

316
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:35,183
It's not imagined.

317
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:40,779
It's waiting in the darkness.
Waiting for someone to awaken it.

318
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,686
Aisling, you're only scaring yourself.

319
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:46,344
The abbot sais that that's all pagan
nonesense.

320
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:48,874
There's no such thing as Crom Cruach...

321
00:29:53,013 --> 00:29:55,305
Don't... speak it's name!

322
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,598
You're really frightened?

323
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,071
Aisling!

324
00:30:18,228 --> 00:30:19,658
Are you hurt?

325
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:24,718
What was that?

326
00:30:24,753 --> 00:30:26,346
I told you ...

327
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:27,443
Crom!

328
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,965
- Brendan?
- Huh?

329
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,828
You can visit the forest again, if you like.

330
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,557
And Pangur can come too.

331
00:30:54,906 --> 00:30:58,315
- But sir, on Iona we always arange them ...
- This is not Iona.

332
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:01,284
The scriptorium will be arranged according to 
my instructions.

333
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,389
But this is not good ...

334
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,730
It will be as I say.

335
00:31:07,373 --> 00:31:10,138
Brother Aidan! I found them! I...

336
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,841
Well, Brendan. It's about time we saw you today.

337
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,895
Where have you been?

338
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,975
I'm listening. Where were you?

339
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,238
I ...

340
00:31:33,273 --> 00:31:34,861
I went into the forest.

341
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:38,431
Just for a little while, not very long.

342
00:31:39,213 --> 00:31:40,315
Just... It was for Brother Aidan ...

343
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:45,270
Brendan. Have I not warned enough
about what lies beyond these walls?

344
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:46,363
Yet you disobey me.

345
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:47,386
I know, but for the book ...

346
00:31:47,421 --> 00:31:52,464
Brendan. You are never to leave
the abbey again without my permission.

347
00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:53,801
Uncle, if you see the book ...

348
00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:57,822
Do you Understand?

349
00:31:57,857 --> 00:31:57,809
Yes, uncle.

350
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,226
Good.

351
00:31:59,525 --> 00:32:04,580
Now come along, there are matters to attend to
in the workroom.

352
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,091
- Look!
- What?
- I found them.

353
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:53,028
You did? So you did!

354
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:54,938
I did have a little help.

355
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:57,274
From a friend in the forest.

356
00:32:58,731 --> 00:33:02,004
There's nothing you can't do
when you have friends to help you, right?

357
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:03,565
Now, let's see.

358
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,574
Yes, yes ... I believe
these will do very nicely ...

359
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:11,548
From tiny berries do great images come to life

360
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:12,549
Come along!

361
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:42,162
Lot of smoke ... that's a good sign.

362
00:33:42,197 --> 00:33:44,185
- It is?
- Yes.

363
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,335
- Ah, beautiful.
- From a stinky berry.

364
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:52,370
Making ink is all very well, but it is useless ...

365
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:54,351
... without one of these.

366
00:33:54,386 --> 00:33:55,651
I'm not... I'm not allowed to...

367
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:58,400
There's no one else here now.

368
00:33:58,401 --> 00:34:00,451
Just you

369
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:02,280
and your imagination.

370
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,286
Afraid?

371
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:12,996
Me? No. I'm not afraid of imaginary things.

372
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:20,985
Keep going! Finish what you start.

373
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,600
Gold!

374
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,265
Not bad.

375
00:35:32,022 --> 00:35:34,499
I'd say he could do it right enough.

376
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,766
Do what?

377
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,719
I must confess my boy.

378
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,249
I haven't been completely honest with you.

379
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:46,066
I can not do the Chi-ro page.

380
00:35:46,101 --> 00:35:49,882
My eyes have become too old.
And my hands unsteady.

381
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:51,403
But .. you said ...

382
00:35:51,438 --> 00:35:53,833
You should be the one to do that page!

383
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:55,814
Me? No! I can never...

384
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,726
there must be somebody else ...

385
00:35:57,761 --> 00:36:00,699
You have to do it.
I would ruin it.

386
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,699
No, no, no. Ofcourse you can do it.

387
00:36:02,734 --> 00:36:04,699
You found those berries

388
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,757
You've certainly developed a steady hand.

389
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,990
Even before I came you'd already learned much
from the other brothers's work.

390
00:36:12,025 --> 00:36:14,257
You've only to unleash your imagination!

391
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:15,547
I have go.

392
00:36:24,107 --> 00:36:26,299
Where have you been so early?

393
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,880
Come along, there is much work to be done.

394
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:34,261
I don't know Pangur...

395
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,786
Something I cannot see, stops him.

396
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,775
If he is ever to light up the Chi-ro page...

397
00:36:46,168 --> 00:36:52,168
he'll have to turn around and stare whatever it
is, in the face!

398
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
Brendan!

399
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:18,640
We're moving the scaffolding to
the west wall. Hurry along now!

400
00:38:28,929 --> 00:38:33,984
I think you're ready to learn Columb Kil's secret.

401
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,249
The mesmerizing detail ...

402
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,757
Of course, you need another eye.

403
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:40,063
Now ...

404
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:44,557
- Once I find the crystal...
- Brother ...

405
00:38:44,592 --> 00:38:47,418
...open up a whole new world...
a tiny wonder...

406
00:38:47,453 --> 00:38:53,453
Columb Kil instructed that the crystal 
should never be used, for less than work
that's worthy of it. 

407
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,396
It has not been used since Iona

408
00:38:55,431 --> 00:38:57,218
What's... a crystal?

409
00:38:57,253 --> 00:39:01,263
This's not a crystal, it's The Crystal!

410
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,853
The eye of Columb Kil.

411
00:39:04,317 --> 00:39:08,801
Columb Kil created over 300 books in his lifetime.

412
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:10,282
By his own hands!

413
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,824
On his deathbed, he prayed that his apprentice 

414
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:16,699
got a vision as clear and wonderful as his own.

415
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,610
then as he drew his last last breath ...

416
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,776
it dropped from his hand ...

417
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,827
... the eye of Colomb Kil !

418
00:39:24,136 --> 00:39:28,269
Colomb Kil would want it to go to you.

419
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,271
Where is it?

420
00:39:29,272 --> 00:39:30,549
Sorry, Pangur.

421
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,080
Have you seen it?

422
00:39:34,882 --> 00:39:35,975
It's lost.

423
00:39:36,953 --> 00:39:38,569
It's all lost!

424
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,895
Where did you last have it?

425
00:39:53,031 --> 00:39:54,700
I don't understand.

426
00:39:54,735 --> 00:39:57,699
If I could show the crystal to you

427
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,035
all would become clear.

428
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,137
- But ...
- But I can still continue my training, can't I?

429
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:07,121
Have you ever studied the tiny pattern, 
on a green fly's wing?

430
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:11,299
- No.
- And you'll never will without the crystal.

431
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,870
What if we pray for a miracle?

432
00:40:13,905 --> 00:40:15,821
Like Colomb Kil did?

433
00:40:15,822 --> 00:40:21,747
Some say, that before the crystal became known,
as the eye of Columb Kil

434
00:40:21,748 --> 00:40:23,399
it had an ancient name.

435
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:29,400
named from the creature that
Colomb Kil won the crystal from.
Deep inside one of it's dweling places.

436
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,155
Crom Cruach!

437
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,530
It was called the eye of "Crom Cruach"

438
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,876
I can't tell you which parts of this story
are true and what parts ...

439
00:40:39,877 --> 00:40:41,547
... are shrouded by the mists.

440
00:40:43,973 --> 00:40:46,743
Ah, there's nothing in this life but mist ...

441
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:51,619
We're only here for a short while...

442
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,599
Don't worry, Pangur.

443
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,605
I won't be long.

444
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,926
You've been forbidden to leave the abbey.

445
00:41:29,961 --> 00:41:32,772
Now you are also forbidden to enter the
scriptorium.

446
00:41:32,807 --> 00:41:34,600
Please, Uncle, you don't understand.

447
00:41:34,635 --> 00:41:37,349
Oh I understand perfectly well!

448
00:41:37,384 --> 00:41:39,057
No more escorsions.

449
00:41:39,092 --> 00:41:42,996
No more scriptorium and no more brother Aidan.

450
00:41:43,496 --> 00:41:44,994
No.

451
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:49,057
What did you say?

452
00:41:49,457 --> 00:41:51,051
I can't do that.

453
00:41:51,655 --> 00:41:53,957
I can't give up the book uncle

454
00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:56,295
If you looked at just one page and
see why.

455
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,599
You've forgotten how important it is

456
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,722
All you want from us is this wall.

457
00:42:00,757 --> 00:42:03,777
Brother Aidan said you were an Illuminator once.

458
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:07,212
- He said ...
- That's enough!

459
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:15,600
If I can't trust you to stay out of harm's way
you'll have to remain here, untill you'll see sense.

460
00:42:32,332 --> 00:42:36,353
Cellach, please, don't blame the boy. 
I'll have a talk with to him and...

461
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:39,048
- You do no such thing.
- You can't ...

462
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:43,989
Brother Tang will bring him his meals and once
there is nothing left here to distract him...

463
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:46,751
Let me keep the book Cellach.

464
00:42:46,752 --> 00:42:48,360
It was entrusted to me.

465
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,951
Allright then.

466
00:42:52,326 --> 00:42:58,326
But on the condition that you leave Kells with the
first sign of spring.

467
00:43:45,712 --> 00:43:48,198
<i> Brendan </i>

468
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:54,675
Aisling!

469
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,178
How can I get you out?

470
00:44:03,213 --> 00:44:04,400
I don't know.

471
00:44:05,403 --> 00:44:07,223
The tower is locked.

472
00:44:07,258 --> 00:44:10,287
And my door is bolted from the outside.

473
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:13,583
The key is in the abbot's room.

474
00:44:14,259 --> 00:44:19,264
Maybe ... you can take a message
to brother Aidan.

475
00:44:42,861 --> 00:44:48,861
You must go where I can not ...

476
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,831
Pangur Ban ...

477
00:46:15,447 --> 00:46:17,544
Why did the abbot put you in there?

478
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:19,641
Because I disobeyed him .

479
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:20,641
Why?

480
00:46:21,249 --> 00:46:22,889
Look!

481
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:26,565
- The Eye of Crom!
- No, it's a crystal.

482
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,020
I think there's one in the Dark One's cave.

483
00:46:29,055 --> 00:46:30,740
I have to go there.

484
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:36,339
No Brendan, it's tricking you.
You should have stayed in your tower.

485
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:40,393
Crom Cruach took my people, it took my mother.

486
00:46:40,428 --> 00:46:44,178
It takes everything. You will die!

487
00:46:44,213 --> 00:46:50,213
Aisling, if I don't try, the book
will never be complete.

488
00:46:55,311 --> 00:46:57,369
The book ...

489
00:46:58,643 --> 00:47:01,600
Alright then, I will help you.

490
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:35,266
Aisling! This place is hurting you,
you must go back.

491
00:47:35,301 --> 00:47:37,260
I'll find someother way.

492
00:47:37,295 --> 00:47:40,833
I.. I must help you...

493
00:47:50,931 --> 00:47:53,360
Please hurry, go now!

494
00:47:53,395 --> 00:47:57,160
Turn the darkness into light.

495
00:50:28,246 --> 00:50:29,246
Aisling!

496
00:50:32,107 --> 00:50:34,040
Aisling!

497
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,484
Old fools!

498
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,423
Old fools should learn to keep quite...

499
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:03,698
... unless young fools want to listen ...

500
00:51:03,733 --> 00:51:06,939
Ha! You're here! How ... How did you ...?

501
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:09,145
How did you get out of the tower?

502
00:51:09,146 --> 00:51:11,633
You must go back before the abbot finds out.

503
00:51:11,634 --> 00:51:15,938
This is not the place for you lad,
there is nothing for you here.

504
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:18,574
But you're here, the book is here ...

505
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:21,101
and the eye is here.

506
00:51:31,135 --> 00:51:34,640
How is this possible?!
It was destroyed!

507
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:37,228
There is more than one story about the eye.

508
00:51:37,263 --> 00:51:40,072
There is more than one dwelling place for the Dark One ...

509
00:51:40,107 --> 00:51:42,881
and he had more than one eye.

510
00:51:43,978 --> 00:51:47,531
You... you entered one of the Dark One's caves?

511
00:51:47,566 --> 00:51:51,085
You can find out everything from books you know.

512
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,299
I think I read that once ...

513
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,546
Right then ... it is time to begin!

514
00:52:27,642 --> 00:52:29,650
Your breakfast, abbot.

515
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,460
Take it to Brendan.

516
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,999
See if ...

517
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,295
See if he has come to his senses.

518
00:55:09,951 --> 00:55:12,585
It's like heaven, no?

519
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:15,220
Heaven on Earth.

520
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,460
Please ... please abbot, it's my fault.

521
00:55:21,762 --> 00:55:22,999
Little fool!

522
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,340
The North Men are upon us
and here you are ... drawing!

523
00:55:29,736 --> 00:55:32,265
We have one day before the Vikings
attack Kells!

524
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,760
- The gate won't hold.
- We must run from here!

525
00:55:34,795 --> 00:55:38,255
The gate will hold!
You will lead the refugees into the chapel.

526
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:41,656
They will seek comfort there untill the attackers
move on.

527
00:55:41,691 --> 00:55:45,022
Tang! Tell villagers to stay in their house.

528
00:55:45,023 --> 00:55:46,692
Cellach!

529
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:53,310
You'll be safe in here with your precious book.

530
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,567
No, not yet!

531
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,922
Stay inside!

532
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,958
Tang! Open the door!

533
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,956
Into the tower!

534
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:05,230
One at a time!
The steps aren't strong enough!

535
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,284
Tang, there are too many!

536
00:58:11,098 --> 00:58:13,150
It's too late.

537
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:26,348
Close the door!

538
00:58:31,835 --> 00:58:33,586
Brendan!

539
00:59:15,345 --> 00:59:17,565
Ink! We have to make ink!

540
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,175
- Brendan! Wait... we can't ...
- Hurry!

541
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,599
Uncle!

542
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,371
No!

543
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,600
No! We must save him!

544
00:59:53,635 --> 00:59:56,600
Quickly Brendan, where is the
secret passage to the forest?

545
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,217
We have to save him!

546
00:59:58,252 --> 01:00:01,067
We can't help him now.

547
01:00:04,776 --> 01:00:07,112
Brendan!

548
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,510
We... We cannot stop.

549
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,607
I have to go back.

550
01:00:54,642 --> 01:00:59,299
The North Men left no one on Iona,
they will leave no one on Kells

551
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,324
- My uncle...
- He lived to protect you.

552
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:05,348
The only way he knew how ...

553
01:01:05,383 --> 01:01:08,337
Now I must protect you

554
01:01:08,372 --> 01:01:11,824
for Cellach and for the book.

555
01:01:13,843 --> 01:01:16,290
Gold!

556
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,500
Brendan!

557
01:02:46,323 --> 01:02:48,410
Aisling!

558
01:02:55,074 --> 01:03:01,074
We have to keep running, Brendan,
and hope that we're fast enough.

559
01:03:19,098 --> 01:03:21,038
He's alive!

560
01:03:25,918 --> 01:03:28,600
I'm so tired.

561
01:03:31,094 --> 01:03:32,996
Tang, leave me be.

562
01:03:34,682 --> 01:03:35,708
Please ...

563
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,022
Leave me be...

564
01:03:44,131 --> 01:03:46,600
You are the abbot of Kells!

565
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,420
You must get up!

566
01:05:24,185 --> 01:05:27,816
The book was never meant to be hidden away behind walls...

567
01:05:27,817 --> 01:05:32,022
... locked away from the world which inspired its creation.

568
01:05:32,023 --> 01:05:33,023
Brendan,

569
01:05:33,752 --> 01:05:36,220
You must take the book to the people

570
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:38,815
So that they may have hope...

571
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:44,850
let it light the way in these dark days of the North Men.

572
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:23,899
Aisling?

573
01:06:40,684 --> 01:06:43,249
I'm so tired.

574
01:06:43,284 --> 01:06:45,779
Please, abbot, you must take your rest.

575
01:06:45,814 --> 01:06:50,830
Rest? With our most important
treasure destroyed?!

576
01:06:50,865 --> 01:06:52,699
But how was I to know?

577
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,203
How could I know he would perish?

578
01:06:55,238 --> 01:06:57,056
Please, abbot.

579
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:05,507
He was only a boy ...

580
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:19,685
Angel of Darkness! Not yet!

581
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:24,071
I need time!

582
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,501
Uncle!

583
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:47,590
Brendan?

584
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,176
It is a dream ...

585
01:07:55,009 --> 01:07:56,839
This is no dream.

586
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:00,599
I'm so happy to find you here.

587
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,985
I thought I'd lost you a long ago.

588
01:08:04,124 --> 01:08:05,504
Brendan!

589
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:08,933
You were only a boy...

590
01:08:08,934 --> 01:08:11,649
All those innocents... lost.

591
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:14,580
- All my fault...
- Please, uncle ...

592
01:08:14,615 --> 01:08:16,277
... Do not distress yourself.

593
01:08:16,312 --> 01:08:18,142
You don't understand.

594
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,673
I have no time, Brendan.

595
01:08:20,674 --> 01:08:22,154
You were right ...

596
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,178
About Kells ...

597
01:08:24,589 --> 01:08:25,879
About Aidan ...

598
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,294
About the book ...

599
01:08:27,329 --> 01:08:29,619
I shouldn't have ...

600
01:08:30,249 --> 01:08:32,494
This is all I have left.

601
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:38,816
It is the only comfort I have in this world.

602
01:08:38,817 --> 01:08:41,289
Brother Aidan was right ...

603
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:44,490
And I tried to stop him.

604
01:08:45,218 --> 01:08:49,033
Aidan never paid you much heed, uncle.

605
01:08:51,334 --> 01:08:53,470
I suppose not ...

606
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:59,505
Brother Aidan lived to see
his work passed on ... and completed.

607
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,786
The Book of Iona!

608
01:09:15,821 --> 01:09:17,753
The Book of Kells...?

609
01:09:20,061 --> 01:09:23,150
The Book of Kells.
610
01:10:15,061 --> 01:10:25,150
