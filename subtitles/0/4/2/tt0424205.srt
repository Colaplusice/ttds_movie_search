1
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,355
- Children, look at this map, the black
mark of which, must be erased.

2
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:51,993
You hide it with your little fingers and you mark it with red.

3
00:01:52,756 --> 00:01:57,270
Then, whatever it may happen, promise to go and find...

4
00:01:57,634 --> 00:02:01,591
...the children of Alsace who are spreading their hands to us.

5
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:07,181
Let the green branch of hope to blosom in our beloved France.

6
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:10,110
Blossom from you, dear child.

7
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,824
Grow up! France is waiting for you!

8
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:18,186
- To rip the map of every trace of Germany and of The Hun...

9
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:22,094
...we must exterminate that race, we must not leave a single one...

10
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:26,616
Heed not, their children's cries They slay all now, the woman too...

11
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:30,810
Or else some day they will rise which
if they're dead, they cannot do.

12
00:02:31,823 --> 00:02:36,212
- We have one and only enemy, who is digging the Germany's grave.

13
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,611
With a heart full of hate, gall and envy...

14
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,936
We have one and only enemy, who raises his murderous hand.

15
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:46,693
You know the enemy's name. It's England.

16
00:04:25,504 --> 00:04:26,777
This is it!

17
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:32,255
War has been declared!

18
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:39,212
Well little brother, are you gonna spend repainting statues?

19
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:40,851
I put you down to that list too!

20
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:45,169
In two days, we're all leaving for basic training in Glascow.

21
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:48,249
At last something's happening in our lives.

22
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:50,931
Well? Are you coming?

23
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:30,494
Two minutes yet mr. Sprink.

24
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:18,876
- I have been ordered...

25
00:07:19,164 --> 00:07:22,199
...to read this message from our beloved Kaiser.

26
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:29,191
This is a dark hour for Germany.

27
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,758
Our land is besieged.

28
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,509
And we must brandish the sword.

29
00:07:36,878 --> 00:07:38,105
I hope...

30
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:42,474
...that God will give us strength to use it well...

31
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:46,713
...so we can resheathe it with dignity.

32
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:56,460
- Two minutes yet, lieutenant!

33
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,591
- We're going out.

34
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:32,349
The german trenches are 100 meters away.

35
00:09:32,758 --> 00:09:35,873
We're bombing their machine-guns for more than an hour.

36
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:37,828
That's good for us.

37
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:43,986
We pass their first line and then the farm which is behind.

38
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:47,509
The 134th will replace us tonight.

39
00:09:47,993 --> 00:09:50,187
So we can get some rest.

40
00:09:51,232 --> 00:09:53,904
The Scots will cover us from the left.

41
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,343
You'll recognize them from their black caps.

42
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:01,375
Don't worry about them, you'll only pay attention to what I say!

43
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:07,139
I'm like you! I want to go back to my home as well!

44
00:10:07,826 --> 00:10:12,295
So let's do what we have to do, and in one
week we'll be back home for Christmas.

45
00:10:20,342 --> 00:10:24,128
Let's do what has to be done!

46
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:28,376
Prepare your bayonets!

47
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:39,931
Load your rifles!

48
00:10:47,132 --> 00:10:49,042
Let's go!

49
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:01,826
- Don't stay here.

50
00:12:03,826 --> 00:12:10,820
Someone of us survives. Don't stay here.

51
00:12:11,343 --> 00:12:15,334
No William... No William! Come on! Come on William!

52
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,949
I abandoned him...

53
00:13:27,877 --> 00:13:30,754
Like a coward... I abandoned him...

54
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:35,590
I let him die... all alone...

55
00:13:35,874 --> 00:13:37,784
- You had no other choice.

56
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:43,669
And now we must pray for him and for all the other casualties.

57
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:53,786
- The reinforcements arrived... We're leaving Dale...

58
00:13:57,547 --> 00:14:01,015
- You stay here with the rest of the
wounded... I'll see you back in base...

59
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,251
- I know you're in the trenches Father...

60
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:27,491
It's Andrew Duncan... I'm not far.

61
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:36,408
Father, I'm eight feet away.

62
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,247
The others... the others are too far away but me...

63
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:52,596
Father, you've got to come over to help...

64
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,952
That's it. Just walk, straight ahead and you'll get on top of me...

65
00:15:07,003 --> 00:15:10,357
I knew... I knew I could count on you Father.

66
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:13,998
- What the hell are you doing? This is a suicide!

67
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,875
Don't run! Don't run off like that, darn you!

68
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:27,311
- Come back... Come back here! - Cease Fire!

69
00:15:34,154 --> 00:15:35,745
- He was the stretcher-bearer! - What?

70
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:41,506
- You shot the stretcher-bearer! - How do you know that?

71
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,507
- Why did you shoot first?

72
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:50,862
- It was a Scotts marauder, sir. I Think I got him!

73
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:54,855
- Good. Stay put. With the slightest move, sound the alert! - Yes sir

74
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:58,413
Sprink... Come with me.

75
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:02,581
- Yes, lieutenant!

76
00:16:05,143 --> 00:16:09,976
- Attention every one. Leave the
enemies weapons in the main trench!

77
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:14,288
- Go help them. - Allright.

78
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:22,973
- We have to rebuild it.

79
00:16:58,245 --> 00:17:01,838
- Don't worry. None saw me.

80
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,874
Did you get hurt?

81
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,997
What happened?

82
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:17,509
You were for barely 15 minutes in
the trench. Reinforcements didn't...

83
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:21,835
- Their machine-guns annihilated us.
I lost a third of my men in 5 minutes.

84
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:26,587
- You saw the Scots retreat on your left and you left the farm.

85
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:29,185
- Did you learn anything new?

86
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:34,664
- I tried the Red Cross but nothing...

87
00:17:34,952 --> 00:17:37,987
Impossible to get news from the enemy zone.

88
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:41,984
Information say, the Germans are treating the civilians good.

89
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,540
Your wife must be at her parents... with the baby...

90
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:54,495
During the bombing, one of our cannons exploded.

91
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:59,333
5 of our men and an officer died instantly.

92
00:17:59,864 --> 00:18:03,696
I asked for you to replace him in that unit.

93
00:18:04,302 --> 00:18:07,736
Artillery is good. You'll move up fast.

94
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,254
- No. I don't want the artillery. I'll stay here with my men.

95
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:16,534
Find another lieutenant. There are many.

96
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:21,331
- I am the Major General here and I
rule according to what I feel right.

97
00:18:21,576 --> 00:18:24,089
You'll do what I tell you to.

98
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:28,884
You'll make Christmas in your unit.

99
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:32,168
Then you'll go to Poitiers for training. That's an order.

100
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:40,325
- If you want your visit to remain secret, you better leave.

101
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,202
My orderly is coming soon.

102
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:47,122
- You'll stay here for 3 days. Then you'll
move in first line to the Delsaux farm.

103
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,681
That sector should be quiet for Christmas.

104
00:18:51,406 --> 00:18:55,716
Get some rest. I'll see you before you leave for Poitiers.

105
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:01,079
- Goodnight. - Goodnight, General.

106
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,793
- Lieutenant, I found you some blankets for tonight.

107
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,152
What's wrong lieutenant?

108
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:21,706
- My wallet... I lost my wallet...

109
00:19:22,115 --> 00:19:25,662
- The wallet with the photo you showed me the other day? - Yes.

110
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:31,909
- What a shame...

111
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:37,500
But you don't need photos to remember your wife.

112
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:43,661
I had a mishap as well. Take a look, lieutenant...

113
00:19:44,188 --> 00:19:48,225
2 centimeters higher, and I'd be dead!

114
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:54,176
It's still ringing!

115
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:59,737
Unstoppable, like me! Right lieutenant?

116
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:15,011
- In the briefing it says we put one every 5 meters.

117
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:17,968
- Every five meters?

118
00:20:20,055 --> 00:20:22,090
- So, how many?

119
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:25,891
- About 100.000.

120
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:30,161
Or 20 trips with train for Lille via Brussels.

121
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:35,361
- Incredible! Christmas trees!

122
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,001
It will take longer to send these trees in front...

123
00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:42,286
...than it would take to send our cannons.

124
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,188
Let miss Sorensen in.

125
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:21,911
- How is he?

126
00:21:23,713 --> 00:21:25,111
- He's fine.

127
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:29,981
His regiment got attacked four days ago...

128
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:32,147
...but they pushed back the enemy.

129
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,784
Now, about your proposal...

130
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:46,334
I'm afraid... I can't accept it.

131
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:51,897
I feel that, as a Dane, you can't
understand how serious the situation is.

132
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:56,021
For 5 months now, 2 million of our men are fighting without pause.

133
00:21:56,302 --> 00:22:02,135
We have neither the time nor the urge to organise a recital.

134
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,730
- It took me a while to understand...

135
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,606
...that I approached the wrong person.

136
00:22:10,857 --> 00:22:15,133
The Heir, who saw me, was delighted with the idea to have...

137
00:22:15,456 --> 00:22:19,083
a recital at his headquarters on Christmas Eve.

138
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:24,004
I was told, you are responsible for the cannons and the convoys...

139
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:26,089
...and also the soldiers.

140
00:22:26,452 --> 00:22:30,807
So if you would kindly sign here, next to the Heir...

141
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:36,003
...before you inform your men.

142
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:46,634
- You'll only see him for a night. What's the point of that?

143
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:50,631
- It will be much more than one night.

144
00:22:53,243 --> 00:22:56,233
Our minutes are longer than yours.

145
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:11,073
Mother, William and I got your package and your letter...

146
00:23:11,596 --> 00:23:14,506
Thanks for the mittens and the mufflers.

147
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:18,353
It's so cold here, they're most welcome.

148
00:23:19,114 --> 00:23:22,582
The thought of you at home nice and warm, keeps us good.

149
00:23:23,592 --> 00:23:25,547
Thanks for the cake too.

150
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:29,021
I hope we'll have some left for Christmas Eve...

151
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,869
Your two sons... who love you.

152
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:36,101
- Good morning Father. - Three cases of whiskey.

153
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:39,503
- That's a lot of ammunition. - I presume I'm invited?

154
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:42,101
- My men are completely exhausted.

155
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:46,776
- We're all tired Gordon... Every single one of us.

156
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:51,018
I can bring you no relief before three days.

157
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:53,816
And if the Germans do attack tonight or
tommorow as its suggested they would.

158
00:23:55,621 --> 00:23:57,656
- We'lljust have have to deal with them. - Yes sir!

159
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,055
- Our valiant stretcher-bearer!

160
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:13,683
You're the one who nearly got one of
his own men killed in no man's land.

161
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:17,846
The stretcher-bearer is supposed to save lives. Not endanger 'em.

162
00:24:18,453 --> 00:24:21,523
I gave orders. Very clear orders...

163
00:24:21,812 --> 00:24:25,849
...that it's forbidden to leave these trenches
in case of a German counter attack!

164
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:28,570
- Yes sir, but the situation... - But, you don't give a damn!

165
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:35,243
Now I suggest you drop the St. Bernard act in future...

166
00:24:36,327 --> 00:24:38,965
...and never forget, something called military discipline!

167
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:46,836
Is that understood? Do you understand?

168
00:24:50,762 --> 00:24:55,629
Perhars you wanna tell me what you're doing here
in the front line in the absence of any combat.

169
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,354
- I was visiting a friend...

170
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:06,715
- What? A friend? Where do you think you are? Your local parish?

171
00:25:08,316 --> 00:25:11,511
Now you'll return with me immediately to the back line.

172
00:25:14,994 --> 00:25:18,382
Come on man! Make yourself usefull for once.

173
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:22,462
Sir. This way's shorter.

174
00:25:33,388 --> 00:25:36,776
We move up here, we take a right through the clergy area...

175
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:39,818
This way? Get me out of here, will you?

176
00:25:44,224 --> 00:25:46,373
I'm sorry we have to go through the clergy sir...

177
00:25:46,863 --> 00:25:48,818
Christ!

178
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:56,051
What a bloody fucking mess. Just get me out of here will ya?

179
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,968
- Yes sir. Absolutely sir! Shut up, will you?

180
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:05,655
As a priest im used to the silence.

181
00:26:06,616 --> 00:26:07,604
- That's enough.

182
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:10,526
- What's going on? - Nothing.

183
00:26:10,895 --> 00:26:14,169
Just a rifle shot. It's dead calm.

184
00:26:14,733 --> 00:26:18,724
Good. Be carefull, they won't stop even on Christmas Eve.

185
00:26:22,811 --> 00:26:24,038
Follow me.

186
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:28,482
- Do you know who's brilliant idea that was? - No.

187
00:26:29,608 --> 00:26:31,518
- That's for you lieutenant.

188
00:26:44,043 --> 00:26:47,477
- Sprink... You'll be leaving us... for a night.

189
00:26:48,722 --> 00:26:49,836
- To go where?

190
00:26:50,721 --> 00:26:54,348
- Home, in a way, where you'll be better.

191
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,028
- Why do you dislike me Lieutenant?

192
00:27:01,557 --> 00:27:05,867
- After your regiment was disbanded, I had to take you.

193
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:09,949
But I prefer masons, bakers, farmers.

194
00:27:10,474 --> 00:27:16,580
Artists like you arejust a waste, nothing but a millstone.

195
00:27:16,832 --> 00:27:19,345
Now go. The officer will take you.

196
00:27:35,665 --> 00:27:39,417
Come on, get moving! 10 o' clock and nothing is done yet.

197
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,210
Take it easy there. Isn't that too short?

198
00:27:56,378 --> 00:28:00,767
- I told you lieutenant, I'm the best barber in Lens.

199
00:28:01,017 --> 00:28:04,212
Even the may or was coming to my store.

200
00:28:06,295 --> 00:28:09,569
- And Henri Hennebicque? Was he your customer too?

201
00:28:09,774 --> 00:28:13,048
- Hennebicque? Doesn't sound familiar...

202
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:14,526
- He was my father-in-law.

203
00:28:14,892 --> 00:28:18,360
Deputy may or. Lives at 21 Cypress street.

204
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:23,809
- You never told me sir. I know Cypress Alley well.

205
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:28,397
I went there several times to get my bike fixed.

206
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,517
At Narcisse Denoyelle, number 43.

207
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:34,593
- I can see it right now, a little blue gate.

208
00:28:40,523 --> 00:28:43,241
- I think I can tell you now...

209
00:28:43,562 --> 00:28:49,714
Sometimes, at nights, I'm heading to the road towards the farm.

210
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,877
Slowly, so I won't get killed...

211
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:57,832
and I sit there... and I look...

212
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:01,630
I know the Delsaux farm pretty well.

213
00:29:01,956 --> 00:29:06,186
I was going there with my bike to get eggs and milk.

214
00:29:06,554 --> 00:29:11,672
Just bey ond the farm is the road to Lens.

215
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:15,270
Straight to Lens.

216
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:23,817
On foot, I'd be back home in less than an hour.

217
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:30,778
With no rush... one hour...

218
00:29:31,106 --> 00:29:33,460
My mother would wait for me at the door...

219
00:29:33,785 --> 00:29:38,379
with a cup filled with hot coffee, just like before...

220
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:56,447
I'm done lieutenant. I think I'm done. Well?

221
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:06,887
There's no mirror in front?

222
00:30:08,413 --> 00:30:10,528
Christ how stupid am I?

223
00:30:11,932 --> 00:30:16,685
But I got you a great haircut sir, you're ready for the party tonight.

224
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,288
If you say so...

225
00:30:22,328 --> 00:30:24,283
- Welcome miss. - My pleasure.

226
00:30:36,243 --> 00:30:38,233
- Miss Sorensen, its a pleasure.

227
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,108
I will not tolerate mistakes! Clean it up right now!

228
00:30:54,237 --> 00:30:57,910
- Where is Nikolaus Sprink? I think he arrived an hour ago.

229
00:31:04,674 --> 00:31:06,868
- Sprink? The tenor?

230
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:11,146
- Miss, we owned this house for 300 years now...

231
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:14,223
...but its no longer our home since September 23rd.

232
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,824
Ask somewhere else, if you can.

233
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:21,420
- If they have any taste, they will put him in my room...

234
00:31:21,628 --> 00:31:22,821
...on the top floor.

235
00:31:23,987 --> 00:31:25,339
- You poor thing...

236
00:31:26,146 --> 00:31:30,501
Good taste... Prussians?

237
00:31:30,825 --> 00:31:33,735
You shouldn't even talk to these people!

238
00:32:01,694 --> 00:32:03,524
- No... I have lice...

239
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:54,244
- We'll sing together again, just like before.

240
00:33:55,215 --> 00:33:58,330
- I'm not like before, Anna.

241
00:34:04,772 --> 00:34:07,365
- Sing for me. Sing for us.

242
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:43,997
- Your Highness.

243
00:34:47,117 --> 00:34:50,824
- I'm glad to see the war didn't affect you.

244
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:55,542
Your volunteer as a private...

245
00:34:56,514 --> 00:34:58,663
...impressed me.

246
00:35:00,313 --> 00:35:05,146
- I am not a volunteer your Highness. I was called like every one else.

247
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,666
- I congratulate you for your initiative, miss.

248
00:35:13,108 --> 00:35:17,304
You reminded us, that despite the war, it's Christmas.

249
00:35:18,626 --> 00:35:21,458
- Thanks to you and your voices...

250
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:24,663
...tonight I'll feel like I am in Berlin.

251
00:35:25,104 --> 00:35:27,776
...where I hope to return as soon as possible.

252
00:35:28,943 --> 00:35:33,253
- Perhars next spring... if everything goes according to plan.

253
00:35:35,141 --> 00:35:36,493
- Next spring!

254
00:38:17,725 --> 00:38:19,999
- Do you smoke?

255
00:38:24,962 --> 00:38:27,839
- Every one smokes in the trenches.

256
00:38:28,161 --> 00:38:31,390
- You have to kill your time in any way possible.

257
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:37,152
- It's five years today, since the day we met...

258
00:38:39,597 --> 00:38:40,790
- In Oslo...

259
00:38:43,356 --> 00:38:46,346
...Five years passed already?

260
00:38:47,754 --> 00:38:51,870
- You have to flirt with death to realize how time flies away.

261
00:38:52,073 --> 00:38:53,425
That's a terrible thing.

262
00:38:57,351 --> 00:39:01,422
All these fat and sated men, parading and drinking champange.

263
00:39:06,628 --> 00:39:08,857
I have to return to the front...

264
00:39:10,227 --> 00:39:14,377
to sing for my comrades, tonight, more than any other time.

265
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:18,213
- For months I was trying to make this true, and you want to go?

266
00:39:18,464 --> 00:39:22,853
- I don't want to leave you... but I must go and sing for them.

267
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:27,689
- I'll return after that. - I'll come with you.

268
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:33,251
- No way! It's too dangerous. You can't imagine how much.

269
00:39:33,778 --> 00:39:35,927
- Since the time you left, not even a single second passed...

270
00:39:36,258 --> 00:39:40,044
...without me wondering if you're still alive.

271
00:39:40,496 --> 00:39:43,930
You are alive. And I am with you. Nothing else matters.

272
00:39:46,734 --> 00:39:49,724
I was waiting this night for very long.

273
00:39:50,093 --> 00:39:53,766
I don't want to lose a single moment.

274
00:39:55,651 --> 00:40:00,677
And without my pass from the Kaiser you'll not go that far...

275
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:04,566
- You got a pass from Kaiser?

276
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:12,322
- The Major general places his trust on you.

277
00:40:16,804 --> 00:40:20,875
- Couldn't they leave us quiet on Christmas Eve?

278
00:40:21,202 --> 00:40:24,954
- We always have to do the dirty work. - I volunteer to go.

279
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,315
I don't want trouble, Gueusselin.

280
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,156
Go there, approach their lines, locate theur
machineguns and return. Understood?

281
00:40:33,718 --> 00:40:39,348
- And if they see me with this moonlight, can I return fire?

282
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:42,433
- Go, be discreet and come back fast if you want a hot meal.

283
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:02,187
- Hey lads. Where did you get the pipes?

284
00:41:04,787 --> 00:41:09,256
From the guys of the 92nd, they learnt we're doing Christmas here.

285
00:41:09,546 --> 00:41:12,423
- Any spare seat there?

286
00:41:12,664 --> 00:41:13,857
Froggy Land.

287
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:17,574
- Come on Father, give us a song.

288
00:41:18,822 --> 00:41:20,698
Play "I dream of my home".

289
00:41:28,899 --> 00:41:30,889
Rosbif Land.

290
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:27,258
Looks like they're having fun there.

291
00:43:28,258 --> 00:43:30,248
Would you like us to have fun as well?

292
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,966
- This is Anna Sorensen. - Good Evening.

293
00:43:37,255 --> 00:43:42,088
- Are you crazy, and you brought a lady here?

294
00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:45,250
- Lieutenant, I convinced the Heir...

295
00:43:45,572 --> 00:43:48,528
...that a little music wouldn't do any harm.

296
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,604
- Good. You can start.

297
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,588
- Lieutenant!

298
00:44:30,956 --> 00:44:34,026
Come and see. Something weird is happening.

299
00:44:40,873 --> 00:44:43,591
- I don't like this lieutenant.

300
00:44:43,992 --> 00:44:47,426
Could be a diversion for some dirty trick.

301
00:46:36,433 --> 00:46:37,831
- Get down every one!

302
00:48:58,224 --> 00:49:01,259
- Good Evening, Englishmen! - Good Evening Germans...

303
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:03,970
...but we're not English, we're Scottish.

304
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,898
- It was very nice, but that's enough.

305
00:49:14,499 --> 00:49:17,171
This is not Berlin Opera.

306
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:21,893
- You're right. It's even better than Berlin.

307
00:49:24,815 --> 00:49:28,931
- Look at that. A meeting and we're not invited!

308
00:49:31,813 --> 00:49:35,599
- Shut up Ponchel. What the hell is going on here?

309
00:49:50,566 --> 00:49:53,079
- Good evening. Do you speak English?

310
00:49:54,045 --> 00:49:56,922
- Yes... A little. - Wonderfull!

311
00:49:57,484 --> 00:50:00,997
- We were talkin about a... a cease fire...

312
00:50:01,802 --> 00:50:04,361
...for Christmas Eve. What do you think?

313
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:14,354
The outcome of this war won't be decided tonight.

314
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:18,390
I don't think any one will criticise us for
leaving down our riffles on Christmas Eve.

315
00:50:18,917 --> 00:50:21,589
Don't worry. It's just for tonight.

316
00:50:22,195 --> 00:50:24,025
- What the hell are they doing?

317
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:29,024
- Maybe the Germans are fed up and want to surrender.

318
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:32,988
- I would be surprised...

319
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:38,785
- Ponchel, give me a bottle of champagne and my beaker.

320
00:50:55,544 --> 00:50:56,976
- Merry Christmas.

321
00:51:16,177 --> 00:51:18,371
- Who's the idiot who did that?

322
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:58,193
- Merry Christmas.

323
00:52:44,307 --> 00:52:46,376
- Good Evening. I'm Anna.

324
00:53:07,499 --> 00:53:09,056
- You first.

325
00:53:23,853 --> 00:53:27,048
- Felix. Where have you been?

326
00:53:28,451 --> 00:53:32,567
- His name is not Felix. It's Nestor.

327
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:37,483
- He's Nestor, the cat from the Delsaux farm.

328
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:40,435
- I know him better than you.

329
00:53:54,842 --> 00:53:57,071
- Nestor's is going to the French side.

330
00:53:58,561 --> 00:54:00,676
- My wife.

331
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,351
- She's a pretty girl. - Very.

332
00:54:11,397 --> 00:54:13,034
- This is my wife.

333
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,503
- Montparnasse.

334
00:54:33,429 --> 00:54:37,739
- It's my wife's favourite part in Paris. The Luxemburg gardens.

335
00:54:39,187 --> 00:54:41,939
- By the way, you didn't show us a picture of your wife.

336
00:54:42,226 --> 00:54:46,297
- Uhm, like you I had a photo of her but... I lost it.

337
00:54:48,864 --> 00:54:53,174
I've draw her face but... that's not really the same.

338
00:55:05,258 --> 00:55:07,646
- Do you live... on Rue Vavin? - Yes...?

339
00:55:16,494 --> 00:55:18,085
- I think I...

340
00:55:19,613 --> 00:55:23,729
I found your wallet in the trench.

341
00:55:24,252 --> 00:55:26,367
I kept it because of the address.

342
00:55:32,209 --> 00:55:35,643
A little hotel on Rue Vavin.

343
00:55:37,687 --> 00:55:41,519
- I spent a week there with my wife, two years ago.

344
00:55:42,165 --> 00:55:44,553
It was our honeymoon.

345
00:55:47,324 --> 00:55:48,722
- Thank you very much.

346
00:55:49,523 --> 00:55:50,796
- You're welcome.

347
00:55:55,241 --> 00:55:58,356
- Hold on, thats Gueusselin's bottle.

348
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:10,672
- Who cares. He went to sleep. - I would be
surprised if he did. - Thank you... very much... sirs...

349
00:56:17,553 --> 00:56:18,905
- It's good!

350
00:56:20,952 --> 00:56:23,784
- How many month's pregnant was she on that photo?

351
00:56:24,071 --> 00:56:25,344
- Five months.

352
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:30,425
She was in Lens, at her parents, last July.

353
00:56:31,908 --> 00:56:36,457
She had complications and had to stay in bed...

354
00:56:37,346 --> 00:56:40,814
I asked to stay with her, but I couldn't.

355
00:56:45,544 --> 00:56:48,693
I was called to go to war, and had to leave her there.

356
00:56:50,622 --> 00:56:54,613
- But... don't you write each other? How is she?

357
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,889
- I had no letter from her since September. They never make it here.

358
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:04,726
I don't even know if it's a boy or a girl.

359
00:58:43,463 --> 00:58:47,613
Hey Scottsman. You know what I got here?

360
00:58:48,221 --> 00:58:51,575
- The French gave me some champagne. Do you want to drink?

361
00:59:47,321 --> 00:59:48,912
- Sing for us.

362
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,717
Sing for them.

363
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,718
- Good evening, gentlemen.

364
01:04:45,223 --> 01:04:46,736
- You were wonderfull.

365
01:04:48,624 --> 01:04:52,538
- I'm Jewish. Christmas means nothing to me.

366
01:04:52,866 --> 01:04:55,665
- But I'll never forget this night. - Thank you.

367
01:05:00,468 --> 01:05:04,223
- So what will happen with the young
lady? - Yes, I wanted to ask you.

368
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:08,300
Could she spend the night in your shelter?

369
01:05:08,751 --> 01:05:10,981
I mean, when is she leaving?

370
01:05:11,753 --> 01:05:14,552
- Tommorow morning. - Fine.

371
01:05:16,554 --> 01:05:21,424
Unfortunately, you can't stay in my shelter. I'm not alone.

372
01:05:22,236 --> 01:05:26,435
There's a big rat, for 3 days now, but I'll get him in the end.

373
01:05:26,758 --> 01:05:30,718
- We'll find a solution. Goodnight lieutenant.

374
01:05:36,002 --> 01:05:39,916
- Don't worry miss, I'll find you a safe place. - Thanks Jorg.

375
01:05:45,285 --> 01:05:49,996
- What did you put in your report to the HQ?

376
01:05:50,327 --> 01:05:53,000
- Well I wrote 24th of December 1914.

377
01:05:53,648 --> 01:05:56,800
- No hostilities on the german side tonight.

378
01:05:58,490 --> 01:05:59,764
- Well, that's the truth.

379
01:06:03,132 --> 01:06:04,724
Tonight...

380
01:06:05,773 --> 01:06:10,006
these men were drawn to that altar like
it was a fire in the middle of winter.

381
01:06:12,015 --> 01:06:15,372
Even those who don't believe came to warm themselves.

382
01:06:17,657 --> 01:06:19,454
...maybejust to be together...

383
01:06:22,739 --> 01:06:25,652
...maybe to forget about the war.

384
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:28,493
- Maybe...

385
01:06:31,582 --> 01:06:33,937
...but the war won't forget us.

386
01:06:58,472 --> 01:07:00,906
- No more flairs.

387
01:07:08,996 --> 01:07:11,385
- Merry Christmas.

388
01:07:44,809 --> 01:07:47,482
- Listen. Someone is digging out there. - Mines!

389
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:51,169
- Those damn Scotts are digging a mine sap.

390
01:07:52,772 --> 01:07:55,411
- They'll fill it with explosives and blow us up.

391
01:07:58,934 --> 01:08:04,214
- No, they're not digging any sap. - They do, listen to me.

392
01:08:04,696 --> 01:08:07,609
- You just became too friendly with them last night.

393
01:08:08,778 --> 01:08:11,246
- Yeah? Look who's talking. - Look!

394
01:08:19,742 --> 01:08:21,812
- Jonathan, Jonathan come with me.

395
01:08:29,345 --> 01:08:34,819
- What the hell you think you're doing? The truce is over!

396
01:08:35,188 --> 01:08:38,818
Any moment now the Germans will start
shooting at you. Get back in the trench! Now!

397
01:08:46,072 --> 01:08:47,630
- Get down. Down!

398
01:08:55,275 --> 01:08:56,549
- Good morning lieutenant. - Good morning.

399
01:08:58,476 --> 01:09:01,833
- Is it possible that we officers, talk about the dead?

400
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,078
- Ponchel. Bring your coffee.

401
01:09:48,655 --> 01:09:52,729
- Thank you Ponchel. You can leave now.

402
01:09:57,738 --> 01:10:00,970
- My men will remove the bodies of the men killed last week...

403
01:10:01,219 --> 01:10:03,096
...so that you can burry them.

404
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:08,380
- And we will return the remains of your
men who fell in our land last November.

405
01:10:09,943 --> 01:10:11,217
- That makes sense.

406
01:10:12,183 --> 01:10:16,257
- Burrying the dead the day Christ was born. Makes sense.

407
01:10:27,789 --> 01:10:29,222
- Oh. I'm fast.

408
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:34,263
- Sorry but... why do you have an alarm
go off every morning at 10 o'clock.

409
01:10:34,392 --> 01:10:35,984
Is it for the changing of the guard?

410
01:10:36,192 --> 01:10:38,581
- Oh no. No, it's just that lieutenant...

411
01:10:38,753 --> 01:10:41,951
...who used to make coffee every day at 10 for his mother.

412
01:10:42,114 --> 01:10:45,266
He is worried he'll forget all about that with the war.

413
01:10:45,556 --> 01:10:47,069
We'rejust used to it.

414
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:49,148
- So are we.

415
01:11:49,339 --> 01:11:51,250
- Do you need help?

416
01:14:03,309 --> 01:14:07,542
- In a few days, their families, their wives...

417
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,979
...will receive the bad news...

418
01:14:14,073 --> 01:14:17,066
It would be better not to think about it.

419
01:14:18,594 --> 01:14:22,986
For them, nothing will ever be the same as it used to be.

420
01:14:26,677 --> 01:14:28,076
And you too...

421
01:14:29,718 --> 01:14:33,951
...one day they'll cover you and dump you in a hole.

422
01:14:37,561 --> 01:14:40,440
Lets go, while there is time.

423
01:14:40,682 --> 01:14:44,073
I have the pass. Holland is not that far.

424
01:14:44,444 --> 01:14:47,835
- They have peace there, we can live. - I can't do that, I'll be a deserter.

425
01:14:48,285 --> 01:14:51,801
- No it's not. We'll be together.

426
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:54,760
- I'm just a soldier... Like every one else...

427
01:14:55,088 --> 01:14:58,206
I have duties, like every one here.

428
01:14:58,849 --> 01:15:02,525
Holland is not that far. They'll get us.

429
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:05,081
Even your pass won't save us.

430
01:15:05,652 --> 01:15:07,483
- There is another way.

431
01:15:08,373 --> 01:15:12,447
The French borders are 100 meters
away. We only have to cross them.

432
01:15:14,615 --> 01:15:17,972
- I made tea. Perhaps you'd like some.

433
01:15:18,456 --> 01:15:19,809
- Come... come...

434
01:15:40,304 --> 01:15:45,425
- The others asked me to give you these letters...

435
01:15:45,986 --> 01:15:51,858
...they don't trust the military post.

436
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:55,427
...and as you're going back to Berlin,

437
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:56,944
...we thought... - Sure.

438
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:16,629
Come on, Moralek! Go for it!

439
01:16:45,288 --> 01:16:47,927
- I heard about your wife last night...

440
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:51,688
...If you want...

441
01:16:52,651 --> 01:16:55,610
...I can pass a letter to her.

442
01:16:56,252 --> 01:17:00,804
- Why would you do that? If you get caught...

443
01:17:01,614 --> 01:17:06,006
A letter won't stop us from winning this war!

444
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:11,446
And when we take over Paris, and everything has finished...

445
01:17:11,698 --> 01:17:15,453
...you can call us for a drink in Rue Vavin.

446
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:18,659
- You don't have to invade Paris to come by for a drink.

447
01:17:22,102 --> 01:17:25,698
- How many cartridges you have to shoot every day? How many?

448
01:17:34,026 --> 01:17:37,303
- Eight. - Ah. Eight? And you?

449
01:17:40,149 --> 01:17:45,463
- Seven. - Seven and eight. - Us, five! Doesn't surprise me!

450
01:17:46,351 --> 01:17:49,230
- Yesterday, William managed to bag two Gerries...

451
01:17:49,472 --> 01:17:51,702
...who'd been sniping at us for hours.

452
01:17:52,033 --> 01:17:55,504
If he keeps this up, he'll qualifies the best shot in the whole platoon.

453
01:17:57,275 --> 01:17:59,550
All our mates have their eyes on your cake...

454
01:17:59,876 --> 01:18:02,596
...but William and I are guarding it closely.

455
01:18:03,157 --> 01:18:05,911
Lots of love, from both of us.

456
01:18:17,522 --> 01:18:20,435
- Still here? Why didn't they send a vehicle?

457
01:18:20,924 --> 01:18:24,838
- We were waiting, but none came to get her.

458
01:18:25,245 --> 01:18:29,034
- I guess the party dragged up till morning in
the headquarters and they're not awake yet.

459
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:40,288
- They called me from the HQ five minutes ago.

460
01:18:40,531 --> 01:18:42,442
They told me you dissapeared.

461
01:18:42,932 --> 01:18:45,652
They thought you deserted Sprink.

462
01:18:46,293 --> 01:18:49,172
I told them you came with miss Sorensen...

463
01:18:49,534 --> 01:18:52,447
...to sing for your comrades.

464
01:18:52,935 --> 01:18:55,085
That really impressed them!

465
01:18:55,416 --> 01:18:59,888
They told me to keep an eye on you till they arrive.

466
01:19:01,419 --> 01:19:04,537
Miss Sorensen will return to Berlin...

467
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:09,457
...and you'll be under arrest... for two weeks...

468
01:19:09,822 --> 01:19:12,735
For disobedience on the front.

469
01:19:15,104 --> 01:19:17,254
- Disobedience on the front?

470
01:19:18,145 --> 01:19:22,776
I don't understand lieutenant. What's the plan for tommorow?

471
01:19:23,267 --> 01:19:28,296
A little football match? An aperitif with those across?

472
01:19:29,949 --> 01:19:35,947
Or will you shoot them like rabbits
after you drink your champagne?

473
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,943
Well lieutenant?

474
01:19:38,552 --> 01:19:43,752
Whats the meaning of all that? It will be more odd
if you die tommorow than if you died yesterday.

475
01:19:43,954 --> 01:19:45,182
- That's enough Sprink.

476
01:19:50,157 --> 01:19:51,715
- Any coffee left?

477
01:20:14,886 --> 01:20:19,324
- Is The French lieutenant here? - Yes, he just arrived.

478
01:20:19,727 --> 01:20:23,721
- What are you doing here? Every one back at his camp, we said.

479
01:20:24,089 --> 01:20:25,488
- I know, I know but...

480
01:20:28,731 --> 01:20:31,610
...our artillery will start shelling you in ten minutes.

481
01:20:32,172 --> 01:20:35,768
- So I suggest you come and shelter in my trench.

482
01:20:50,019 --> 01:20:53,535
- If you had been relieved, I wouldn't
have come to warn your successors.

483
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:57,456
They would have shot you before you take a step in no man's land.

484
01:20:57,701 --> 01:20:59,692
Par for the course.

485
01:21:16,028 --> 01:21:17,939
- Don't say a word Sprink.

486
01:21:56,363 --> 01:21:57,762
- Bullseye... Sorry.

487
01:22:02,445 --> 01:22:05,005
- Damn! We'll have to rebuild that!

488
01:22:17,411 --> 01:22:22,532
- By the way... That letter for my wife...

489
01:22:35,738 --> 01:22:37,808
- We ceased fire.

490
01:22:38,539 --> 01:22:42,613
It's time for you to go back. I hope you both make it for the war.

491
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:49,018
- I don't think it's over yet. I wouldn't be surprised
if our own artillery open fire after your attack.

492
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:52,453
- Par for the course.

493
01:23:32,078 --> 01:23:35,754
- This time I think we should seperate.

494
01:23:38,961 --> 01:23:40,713
I'm glad I met you.

495
01:23:42,722 --> 01:23:46,716
Perhars, under other circumstances...

496
01:23:48,004 --> 01:23:49,756
...we could have... - Yes maybe.

497
01:23:51,285 --> 01:23:55,518
Even a drink in Rue Vavin as a tourist.

498
01:23:57,928 --> 01:24:01,205
- That would be..."chouette", isn't that how you call it?

499
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:06,089
- Yes. Your French are better than my German.

500
01:24:06,331 --> 01:24:09,688
- Ofcourse. But your wife is German.

501
01:24:16,335 --> 01:24:18,246
- Well... Good luck. - You too.

502
01:24:37,142 --> 01:24:39,781
- Goodbye. - Good luck.

503
01:24:40,584 --> 01:24:42,415
- Let's go boys!

504
01:25:16,517 --> 01:25:18,189
- Lieutenant...

505
01:25:20,518 --> 01:25:24,273
...I managed earlier to trace all their machine-guns.

506
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,272
It's all there.

507
01:26:12,457 --> 01:26:14,687
- What are you doing here? Every one left already.

508
01:26:15,579 --> 01:26:17,570
- We came to keep us as prisoners.

509
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:20,290
- Prisoners? That's impossible!

510
01:26:21,421 --> 01:26:25,574
How am I going to explain your presence to my superiors?

511
01:26:25,822 --> 01:26:27,255
I can't do that!

512
01:26:28,063 --> 01:26:31,739
Go back to your trenches. Play time is over now!

513
01:26:35,026 --> 01:26:37,985
Sir... lf we go back to the German side they will seperate us.

514
01:26:40,548 --> 01:26:45,339
Put us in a prison, but let us be together.

515
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:46,898
I beg you.

516
01:26:51,832 --> 01:26:56,065
- Take those two to the village.

517
01:26:57,914 --> 01:27:02,306
They are prisoners. Put them in the
school till they go somewhere else.

518
01:27:02,636 --> 01:27:05,275
And stay with them, We'll be there tommorow.

519
01:27:05,597 --> 01:27:10,797
- Lieutenant. Can you give those
letters to the red cross? It's important.

520
01:27:29,446 --> 01:27:31,277
- Where is Ponchel? I've been looking for him an hour now.

521
01:27:31,527 --> 01:27:33,677
- He said he was going to eat something.

522
01:27:55,055 --> 01:27:57,775
- "My dear, I cling to your memory...

523
01:27:58,096 --> 01:27:59,768
...like a climber cling to his rope, so he won't fall".

524
01:28:00,737 --> 01:28:03,126
- "The poor guy died between our lines."

525
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:05,926
- "Before we understand it, they scored six times!

526
01:28:06,339 --> 01:28:12,735
- They later admitted that most of them
play for a Munich club called Bayern".

527
01:28:13,542 --> 01:28:16,580
- "I will never forget the voice of that woman in the night..."

528
01:28:16,823 --> 01:28:20,339
- "Drink with those bastards? I'd rather die."

529
01:28:25,066 --> 01:28:29,299
- "The Scottish photographer promised
us photos from New year's Eve,"

530
01:28:29,788 --> 01:28:33,225
- "A Bavarian gave me his address,
to visit him when the war is over."

531
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:38,106
"We'll spend New Year's eve with the germans...

532
01:28:38,511 --> 01:28:42,266
We'll sing the song the Scotts taught us.

533
01:28:42,593 --> 01:28:44,823
And we'll drink to the health of all those bastards

534
01:28:45,154 --> 01:28:51,152
who are sitting at their warm houses, and sent us here to die".

535
01:29:23,168 --> 01:29:24,681
- He's all yours now.

536
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:59,899
- You're being sent back to your parish in Scotland.

537
01:30:00,862 --> 01:30:03,092
I brought you your marching orders.

538
01:30:08,865 --> 01:30:12,302
- I belong with those who are in pain...

539
01:30:12,626 --> 01:30:15,903
...and who have lost their faith... I belong here.

540
01:30:16,868 --> 01:30:19,018
- I'm very dissapointed from you.

541
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:24,539
When you requested permission to
accompany the recruits from your parish...

542
01:30:25,351 --> 01:30:27,581
I personally vouched for you.

543
01:30:29,432 --> 01:30:32,152
But then... then I heard what happened...

544
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:35,186
...I prayed for you.

545
01:30:39,436 --> 01:30:43,510
- I sincerely believe that our Lord Jesus Christ guided me...

546
01:30:45,118 --> 01:30:48,395
...In what was the most important mass in my life.

547
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,471
I tried to be true to His trust...

548
01:30:55,362 --> 01:30:59,117
...and carry His message to all, whoever he may be.

549
01:30:59,683 --> 01:31:03,040
- Those men who listened to you on Christmas Eve...

550
01:31:03,445 --> 01:31:05,675
...will very soon bitterly regret it.

551
01:31:06,166 --> 01:31:10,319
Because in a few days times their regiment has to be disbanded...

552
01:31:10,567 --> 01:31:13,366
...by order of his majesty, the King.

553
01:31:13,689 --> 01:31:18,002
Where will those poor boys end up in the front line now.

554
01:31:18,650 --> 01:31:21,289
And, what will their families think?

555
01:31:21,611 --> 01:31:24,410
- Excuse me Reverence. The boys are ready.

556
01:31:27,694 --> 01:31:31,131
- They're waiting for me, to preach a sermon to the soldiers...

557
01:31:31,455 --> 01:31:35,131
...who are replacing those who went stray with you.

558
01:31:36,737 --> 01:31:40,333
May the Lord Jesus Christ guide your steps back...

559
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:43,616
...to the straight and narrow path.

560
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:49,210
- Is that the true path of our Lord?

561
01:31:51,943 --> 01:31:54,503
- You are not asking the right question.

562
01:31:55,144 --> 01:32:00,344
Think about this... Are you really suitable to remain...

563
01:32:00,586 --> 01:32:03,020
...among us in the house of our Lord?

564
01:32:36,679 --> 01:32:41,231
Christ, our Lord, said...

565
01:32:41,561 --> 01:32:45,032
"Think not that I come to bring peace.
I come not to bring peace but a sword"

566
01:32:45,722 --> 01:32:48,111
The Gospel according to St. Matthew.

567
01:32:53,245 --> 01:32:57,637
Well my brethrin, the sword of the Lord, is in your hands.

568
01:32:57,807 --> 01:33:01,562
You are the very defenders of civilization itself.

569
01:33:02,049 --> 01:33:05,725
The forces of good, against the forces of evil.

570
01:33:06,690 --> 01:33:10,206
Because this war, is really...

571
01:33:10,852 --> 01:33:14,846
...a crusade... a Holy war...

572
01:33:15,814 --> 01:33:19,046
...to save the freedom of the world.

573
01:33:19,895 --> 01:33:21,248
In truth I tell you...

574
01:33:23,256 --> 01:33:27,887
...the Germans do not act like us, neither do they think like us...

575
01:33:28,058 --> 01:33:32,530
...cause they are not like us...

576
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:38,133
...children of God. Are those who shell
cities populated only by civilians...

577
01:33:38,462 --> 01:33:41,261
...the children of God?

578
01:33:42,463 --> 01:33:45,422
Are those who advance armed...

579
01:33:45,825 --> 01:33:49,262
...hiding behind women and children...

580
01:33:49,826 --> 01:33:52,056
The children of God?

581
01:33:54,308 --> 01:34:00,545
With God's help, we must kill the Germans...

582
01:34:00,790 --> 01:34:03,589
...good or bad, young or old...

583
01:34:03,911 --> 01:34:05,663
Kill every one of them...

584
01:34:07,673 --> 01:34:11,110
...so it won't have to be done again.

585
01:34:14,715 --> 01:34:16,546
- May the Lord be with you. - And also with you.

586
01:34:18,957 --> 01:34:21,107
May God Almighty will bless you...

587
01:34:21,438 --> 01:34:25,910
...the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen!

588
01:34:43,846 --> 01:34:45,359
- Every one to their posts! - Every man to his post!

589
01:34:47,287 --> 01:34:48,515
- Quickly!

590
01:34:56,731 --> 01:35:00,247
- What are you doing. Shoot the bloody Kraft!

591
01:35:00,572 --> 01:35:03,883
What are you waiting for? Shoot him God damn it! Parties are over!

592
01:35:08,975 --> 01:35:13,686
What the hell you think you playing at? Shoot him! Shoot him!

593
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:24,571
Stay down to your posts.

594
01:35:31,384 --> 01:35:35,094
Shame on you Gordon... Shame on you...

595
01:36:00,754 --> 01:36:04,873
- It was very stupid to die disguised as a German, right Sir?

596
01:36:06,276 --> 01:36:07,948
- What the hell were you doing?

597
01:36:10,878 --> 01:36:15,236
- I had a German who helped me...

598
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,918
I saw my mother...

599
01:36:19,801 --> 01:36:22,440
We drank coffee together... Just like before...

600
01:36:25,484 --> 01:36:27,122
You have a son...

601
01:36:30,525 --> 01:36:32,436
Henri is his name...

602
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:39,943
- How did you let yourself...? - lf you came to preach, go now!

603
01:37:40,231 --> 01:37:43,144
- Don't you realise how serious this is?

604
01:37:43,352 --> 01:37:47,346
It's high treason. Punished by death.

605
01:37:47,914 --> 01:37:51,464
But we can't execute 200 men. That's what saves you.

606
01:37:53,596 --> 01:37:56,953
And I'm not counting all the other cases of
fraternization which reported since that.

607
01:37:57,758 --> 01:38:01,957
- If public learn about this... - Noone will say it...

608
01:38:02,559 --> 01:38:05,518
- I hope so... - I mean I think so...

609
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:07,033
- You think so?

610
01:38:07,161 --> 01:38:09,436
- The men involved in that are not ashamed of what they've done.

611
01:38:09,762 --> 01:38:13,995
If they won't tell it, it's because noone
would believe or understand 'em.

612
01:38:14,244 --> 01:38:18,477
- Unbelievable! Carousing with the enemy
while part of the country is occupied.

613
01:38:18,685 --> 01:38:22,440
- The country? What does the country
know of what we're suffering here?

614
01:38:22,807 --> 01:38:27,040
Of what we're doing without
complaining. Let me tell you something...

615
01:38:27,288 --> 01:38:30,440
...I feel closer to the Germans than to those who cry...

616
01:38:30,650 --> 01:38:33,370
..."Kill the Germans!", while eating their turkey.

617
01:38:33,611 --> 01:38:34,805
- That's nonsense.

618
01:38:34,891 --> 01:38:39,044
- No. It's just that you're not living the same war as me.

619
01:38:41,134 --> 01:38:44,013
- You and your men will rejoin the Verdun sector.

620
01:38:45,495 --> 01:38:47,133
You're right about one thing.

621
01:38:47,656 --> 01:38:50,694
I don't understand this war.

622
01:38:51,057 --> 01:38:52,968
My Weapon was the cavallary.

623
01:38:53,858 --> 01:38:57,534
You'd make a career there, like I told you.

624
01:38:57,940 --> 01:39:02,969
Today, I have to fight a war where the shover outweights the rifle.

625
01:39:03,382 --> 01:39:08,981
A war in which people swap addresses with
the enemy, so they can meet when it's all over.

626
01:39:10,264 --> 01:39:13,382
Plus the cat we found with a note from the Germans...

627
01:39:13,786 --> 01:39:15,378
"Good Luck comrades!"

628
01:39:15,626 --> 01:39:19,666
I was ordered to arrest the cat for high treason...

629
01:39:22,509 --> 01:39:24,022
untill further notice...

630
01:39:25,670 --> 01:39:27,661
- You're a grandfather, dad...

631
01:39:41,516 --> 01:39:43,074
His name is Henri.

632
01:39:45,157 --> 01:39:47,387
- What are you talking about?

633
01:39:49,399 --> 01:39:51,549
How did you find out?

634
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:55,078
- You wouldn't understand.

635
01:40:01,323 --> 01:40:02,676
- Henri. Not bad.

636
01:40:04,724 --> 01:40:07,397
Henri Audebert.

637
01:40:10,206 --> 01:40:13,563
Let's try and survive this war for him, huh?

638
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:48,134
- Sit down.

639
01:40:52,742 --> 01:40:56,782
In two days you'll be in East Prussia...

640
01:40:57,104 --> 01:41:00,222
...to take part in an offense against the Russian army,

641
01:41:00,705 --> 01:41:04,619
I hope you'll show pugnacity in the face of the enemy.

642
01:41:05,187 --> 01:41:08,021
The train will cross the fatherland...

643
01:41:08,388 --> 01:41:12,223
...but it won't be possible for you to see your families.

644
01:41:12,469 --> 01:41:15,223
Why? I think you know why...

645
01:41:18,312 --> 01:41:20,382
- Long live Kaiser Wilhelm! - Long live Kaiser!

646
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,639
- They're giving these to almost every one.

647
01:43:40,684 --> 01:43:46,682
The movie is dedicated in the memory of the German, the Brittish...

648
01:43:46,726 --> 01:43:53,725
...and the French soldiers in the front line, Christmas of 1914.
