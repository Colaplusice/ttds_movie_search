1
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,253
One fine spring day...

2
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,991
a disciple looked at some branches
blowing in the wind.

3
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,533
He asked his master...

4
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:14,334
"Master, are the branches moving
or is it the wind?"

5
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:18,539
Not even glancing to where
his pupil was pointing...

6
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,839
the master smiled and said...

7
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:26,919
"That which moves is neither
the branches nor the wind... "

8
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,544
"It's your heart and mind. "

9
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:48,130
Sunwoo, you should
go downstairs for a moment.

10
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,140
Why?

11
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,437
There's some trouble.

12
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,907
Okay, I'll handle it.

13
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,621
I'm sorry, but
business hours are over.

14
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,997
Please get up and leave
before I count to three. One.

15
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,103
Two.

16
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,880
Three!

17
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,082
Sit down, stupid!

18
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,581
Min-gi, lock the door.

19
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,869
You son of a bitch!

20
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,321
See you tomorrow.

21
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,327
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

22
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:13,240
Yes, boss. I'll transfer
the money in the morning.

23
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,441
All right, we'll close
for the night, sir.

24
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,323
So, did you take care
of yesterday's business?

25
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,299
Yes, sir.

26
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,530
Good. You always seem
to get things done.

27
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,444
It looks like Chairman Baek's son
is the one making trouble.

28
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,846
Yes, it didn't seem like
Chairman Baek did it himself.

29
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,885
Chairman Baek's son used
to be a loan shark...

30
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,217
I heard he's interested
in this business.

31
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,346
Abalone, sir.

32
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,585
There's talk that he started
dealings with Southeast Asia.

33
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,592
Why?

34
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:43,696
He's pushing businesses to hire
Filipina girls instead of Russians.

35
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,230
Assholes. Like father, like son.

36
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:50,874
It's me...

37
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,268
Moon Suk.

38
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,879
I shouldn't have brought my car...

39
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,577
I hope I'm not interrupting?

40
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:01,885
Oh, it's okay.

41
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,020
What's that? Abalone?

42
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,523
Get another for me.

43
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,114
Yes, sir.

44
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,524
Hey, sorry about yesterday.

45
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,394
I can't believe that happened.
I just stepped out for a second.

46
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,266
You must have been busy
enough upstairs.

47
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,268
Those guys yesterday
were just local boys.

48
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,743
Nothing to worry about, sir.

49
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,937
What do you think you're doing?

50
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,608
Sir?

51
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,242
Is this how you do business?

52
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,781
- It was just...
- Get out now.

53
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,288
Get out and wait for me!

54
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,179
Be smart.

55
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,309
Things are going good for you now.

56
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,921
But the world is not easy.

57
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:14,119
You can do 100 things right, but
one mistake can destroy everything.

58
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,985
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

59
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,957
I'll try to sort things out
with Chairman Baek.

60
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:26,528
Anyhow, the real reason
I asked you here...

61
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:30,565
I have to go to Shanghai
tomorrow afternoon on business...

62
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,941
I have a favor to ask
before I leave.

63
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,274
The thing is...

64
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,419
Pour me a drink.

65
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,422
Oh, yes, sir. Sorry.

66
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,996
The truth is,

67
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,167
I have a young girlfriend.

68
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,771
Someone I really care about.

69
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,939
She's not like you and me.
She's a special kind of person.

70
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,620
What, am I boring you?

71
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,950
Uh... Congratulations, sir.

72
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,926
Never mind "Congratulations. "

73
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,828
The problem is, I think
She's seeing a new guy.

74
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,695
Some young guy is hanging around her.

75
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,395
It's driving me crazy,
and I couldn't tell anyone else.

76
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,031
You know, you're the only one
I can really talk to about this.

77
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,245
No one else knows how much
this worries me.

78
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,376
So, I'd like you to watch Heesoo
for just three days.

79
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,879
Watch her?

80
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,547
Watch over her.
Take care of her.

81
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,251
See if she's really seeing someone.

82
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,260
Maybe the bastard's just bothering her.

83
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,161
See whether she's given him
her body and soul and all.

84
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:05,962
You know young people,
a hand could brush a shoulder...

85
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,563
then they hold hands, then kiss,
and then... you know...

86
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,506
These things happen.

87
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,944
But I can't stand thinking
about her like that.

88
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,943
Stupid, isn't it?

89
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,112
No, sir.

90
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,179
Stupid.

91
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,692
So... I want you to find out
who she's meeting.

92
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,126
And what she does when they meet.

93
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,686
Just for 3 days.

94
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,401
This is Heesoo's address
and phone number.

95
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:44,640
I hope she's not seeing him,
but if she is...

96
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,669
If they look like they're involved...

97
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,648
Call me right away.
Or finish them off yourself.

98
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,275
Excuse me?

99
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,152
You know I can't stand
being lied to, right?

100
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,124
Love isn't love if you're
being lied to.

101
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,387
You can contact me here
in Shanghai.

102
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,553
Directly.

103
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,862
Have a good night.

104
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,064
Do you have a girlfriend?

105
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,662
No, sir.

106
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,904
Have you ever been in love?

107
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,911
No, you haven't.

108
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,176
That's why I'm entrusting you
with this job.

109
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,217
That's why I like you.

110
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,552
Okay, let's go.

111
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:31,785
Goodbye, sir!

112
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,422
President Kang told me
to give this to you personally.

113
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:15,289
I'm sorry?

114
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,590
President Kang told me
to give this to you personally.

115
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:21,494
What's that?

116
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,772
Wow, it's so funny-looking.

117
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,942
It's so like Mr. Kang.

118
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,002
It's cute.

119
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,274
Don't you think so?

120
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,445
Hello, not yet.

121
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,252
Already? Hold on a second...

122
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,260
President Kang also said
I should drive you today.

123
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,098
Oh, I don't need a ride.
You can go, it's fine.

124
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,562
- He said I should take you myself.
- I'll let him know about it.

125
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,168
Well, then, I'll see you later.

126
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:20,446
If you need anything,
please contact me here.

127
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,214
It's okay, I don't need it.

128
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,590
Oh, give it to me anyway.

129
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,856
Goodbye.

130
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,908
Heesoo, Heesoo.

131
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,834
They sure like to get around...
Maybe it's because they're still young?

132
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,076
Why isn't she getting out?

133
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,459
Hey, Moon Suk.
Everything okay?

134
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:54,895
What?

135
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,070
President Baek, that asshole...

136
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,971
He keeps calling and bothering me.

137
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,975
Asking how could we do this to him.

138
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,944
He says he lost face
because of you.

139
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,811
He wants to meet you.

140
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:17,516
I said no, his guys were to blame.

141
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,355
But he insists on meeting you.

142
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,862
He's calling me every 10 minutes.

143
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,794
I think you should...

144
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:29,059
What the...
Who's bugging me now?

145
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,503
See? He's calling again.
I'm sick of getting it.

146
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,131
You take care of it now.

147
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,222
Hello, this is Kim Sunwoo.

148
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,636
Well, if you have something to say,
Come here and tell me yourself.

149
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,193
I'm hanging up.

150
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,506
I took care of it.

151
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:17,146
Hello, hello.
He... hello? Hello?

152
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,151
Fucker, hung up on me.

153
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,017
What a rude bastard. Hello?

154
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,180
Should I?

155
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,518
Leave it!

156
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:41,535
Laughing? You think that's funny?
Funny huh?

157
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:48,107
You go around smiling like an idiot...
That's why you get your ass kicked.

158
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,808
Damn you bastard, look at me.

159
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,180
Look at me, damn it.

160
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,613
Funny?

161
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,015
I'm sorry, sir.

162
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:02,757
Do you think it's funny?

163
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,228
Funny, funny, funny?

164
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,288
Funny?

165
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,231
Shit!

166
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,936
What hell were you thinking?
You're making it even worse!

167
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,217
Hey, this is your job.

168
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,347
I took care of it
because you weren't there.

169
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,187
This kind of thing is your job.
You should've taken care of it.

170
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,454
They just want to do business
with us...

171
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:40,726
...and beat us to the punch
before starting to deal.

172
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,266
Don't you get it?

173
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,461
What are you lecturing me now?

174
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,033
Hey, get the phone over here.

175
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,194
Yes sir.

176
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,232
Here, sir.

177
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,014
What an idiot.

178
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,676
What? Is this voice dial?

179
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:39,752
Don't you think we need
to press the numbers?

180
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:41,653
Should I dial it with my mouth?

181
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,761
Stupid motherfuckers.

182
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,967
Call Moosung from Samseongyo.

183
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,006
Yes, sir.

184
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,784
You didn't answer your mobile,
so I'm leaving this message.

185
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:46,813
If you have some time, I need
your help for a little while.

186
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:51,352
Just until 3 in the afternoon.
After that, it's fine.

187
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,954
If you get this message...

188
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,430
Yes, it's me. It's Sunwoo.

189
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:59,562
Ah, yes. At what time? And right now it's...

190
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,597
I'll be there in an hour
at the latest.

191
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,107
I'm on my way.

192
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:36,533
Mr. Kang said you're a scary guy.

193
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,074
Excuse me?

194
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:40,770
He did?

195
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,544
Yes...

196
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,048
You're an enforcer, aren't you?

197
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,787
I gave you my card the other day.

198
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,355
I work at a hotel.

199
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,031
So you're an enforcer for the hotel?

200
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,404
I'm not that kind of person.

201
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,108
You're so boring to talk to.

202
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:32,863
Can I ask you something?

203
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,159
Sure.

204
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,302
How did you first meet Mr. Kang?

205
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,861
- Wait a minute.
- Okay.

206
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,599
How much is the red lamp?

207
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,473
$280

208
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,979
$280?

209
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,914
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

210
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,017
Let's go.

211
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,516
What were you saying?

212
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,563
You asked why I am seeing Mr. Kang?

213
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,327
Yes.

214
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,997
Why do you want to know?

215
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:16,398
It's just... you don't have
to answer.

216
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,872
- Hello.
- Hello.

217
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,115
I'll take that now.

218
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:38,555
I'm sorry.

219
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,927
For what?

220
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,194
Asking you those questions.

221
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,834
It's okay.

222
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,631
Thanks for your time today.
I didn't want to eat by myself.

223
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,677
If you'd like to take a look,
you can enter through that door.

224
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,211
How will you return home?

225
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:58,477
It's easy to catch a cab here.

226
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,427
You guys ready?

227
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,193
- Yeah, ready.
- Okay

228
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,535
Let's go.

229
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,683
Hi, Min-gi.

230
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,879
Someone came to see you
early this morning.

231
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:43,852
Who was it?

232
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,117
Oh Moosung. Do you know him?
He's one mean-looking guy.

233
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,056
Moosung? I don't know him.

234
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,559
Anything else?

235
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,993
Moon Suk is looking for you.
You want to talk to him now?

236
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,998
No, Min-gi, don't put him through.

237
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,731
I'll be going to the hotel soon.

238
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,842
Well, well, well.

239
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,214
Bottoms up.

240
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,839
Someone's coming.

241
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,476
Hey, Sunwoo, come over here.

242
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:15,814
Sunwoo?

243
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,144
Hello.

244
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,212
Come here, come.

245
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,120
Come.

246
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,488
Why don't you come over
here for a second?

247
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,788
Ji-hyun, this is Mr. Kim's seat.

248
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,387
Come.

249
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,299
Have a seat.

250
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:33,769
Hey, why are you always so
secretive about the thing you do?

251
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,305
What's up?

252
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,440
Have a drink.

253
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,601
Girls, get out.

254
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:39,665
What are you doing?

255
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,076
Don't ruin the fun.
Relax.

256
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,206
Say hello to President Baek.

257
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,546
From the Baek-Sang Management Agency.

258
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,522
Hi. I'm sorry I was rude
the other day.

259
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,353
- I guess we had a misunderstanding.
- Is that why you came here?

260
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,687
Yes, that and...

261
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,888
There was no misunderstanding.

262
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,954
Who do you think we are?

263
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,059
- Hey, Sunwoo!
- You be quiet.

264
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,602
Don't use your people
to mess with me anymore.

265
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:07,695
Sunwoo!

266
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,231
He's here as my guest today!

267
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:16,671
Damn it, how could you
do this to me?

268
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,375
I can do this because it's you.

269
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:31,555
Kim Sunwoo, do you think
the world is all yours?

270
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,159
Don't do anything you'll regret.

271
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,152
Aren't you going?

272
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,353
- You go first.
- See you.

273
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:54,904
Heesoo.

274
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,478
Hi.

275
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,717
Did you have a good date today?

276
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,252
Stop kidding.

277
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,721
Where did you say
you'd sleep tonight?

278
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,489
Thanks.

279
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:15,497
How should we do this?

280
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,363
I will call you tomorrow.

281
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,063
Just call me...

282
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:21,860
Yeah, Min-gi.

283
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:29,401
That asshole can't drive for shit!

284
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,032
I wasn't talking...

285
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,678
I wasn't talking to you.

286
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,674
What about Moon Suk?

287
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,445
Did you go down to the club?

288
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,647
Ok.

289
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,432
Who is it?

290
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,749
Who is it?

291
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,636
Seyoon, don't!

292
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,082
Seyoon!

293
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,609
Stop it!

294
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,022
You bastard!

295
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,630
You know who I'm calling, don't you?

296
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,106
Any last words?

297
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,095
You finish them off yourself.

298
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,015
Okay. This is what we'll do.

299
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,791
I'll give you a chance.

300
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,093
Listen. Both of you.

301
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,356
You must never see each other again.

302
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,869
All this today never happened
for any of us, including me...

303
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,734
This moment never existed.

304
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,207
Erase it completely.

305
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,573
Not just from your memories,
but from your habits, too.

306
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,540
Don't say it's hard...

307
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:06,141
Because this can get more serious
than either of you can imagine.

308
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,448
No point thinking about it
any longer so...

309
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,214
You, hurry, get dressed and leave.

310
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:20,687
Seyoon, don't do this.

311
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:26,226
- Seyoon!
- Heesoo, Heesoo.

312
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:28,436
Heesoo.

313
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,303
- Leave me alone!
- Listen to me!

314
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:31,398
Let me go!

315
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:39,048
Do you really believe we can just
forget about what happened here tonight?

316
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,913
- This...
- Do you... really... think so?

317
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:45,445
I was just looking
for the best way out of this.

318
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,322
Okay, you can go now.

319
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:50,758
Heesoo.

320
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,058
I don't have anything else to say.

321
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,197
You understand I can't say
anything, right?

322
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,396
Should I thank you
for saving my life or something?

323
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:07,009
Please leave now.
I'll do as you say.

324
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,678
Heesoo.

325
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,380
That's not the way it is.

326
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,715
You know it can't be erased.

327
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,121
Hey, open the window.

328
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:05,562
Hey!

329
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,846
That fucking asshole!

330
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,095
What's wrong with that guy?

331
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,696
Hey!

332
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,575
Asshole!

333
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,370
Who's there?

334
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,537
Get out here,

335
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,743
you pricks!

336
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:38,213
Come on out. Now.

337
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,410
Are you alone?

338
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,616
Let's just go one-on-one then.

339
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,552
I'm Oh Moo-sung from Samseongyo.

340
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,954
Whoever the fuck you are,
just get over here.

341
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,719
I'm sick of talking.

342
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:27,961
Calm down.

343
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:30,006
I only came to give you a message.

344
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:31,905
Did Mr. Baek send you?

345
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,201
Tell me.

346
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:40,176
Apologize.
Then nothing will happen.

347
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,610
"I. Was. Wrong. "
Three little words.

348
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:49,453
If you say those three words,
nothing horrible will happen.

349
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:54,924
"I. Was. Wrong. "
Just three words.

350
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,533
Fuck. Off. Asshole.

351
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,569
Think it over.

352
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,803
Stop talking shit and
get the fuck outta here.

353
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,208
Everyone's got to live their life.

354
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,807
Aren't you going
to answer the phone?

355
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,142
It's okay, it's not important.

356
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,080
Would you like some coffee?

357
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:05,087
No, it's okay.
I have to go soon.

358
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,597
Come over here.

359
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,376
You look pretty upset.

360
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,745
What's wrong?

361
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,109
No, I'm ok.

362
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,313
Hey!

363
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,621
But I'm moving out.

364
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,353
I put this house up for sale.

365
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,070
Do you know why I like you?

366
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:54,342
It's because you don't care
what other people think.

367
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:55,605
That's interesting.

368
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:59,580
I used to think you were to young.

369
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,709
But I still come
to see you, like today.

370
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:04,151
And you still make me look for you.

371
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:06,653
That's what I like about you.

372
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:14,092
What do you think it is?
Being young is a gift, too.

373
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:21,898
As you get older,
you lose patience.

374
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,921
Ma'am... ma'am...

375
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,153
Ma'am... ma'am...

376
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:05,459
Ma'am... ma'am...

377
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,987
Hey, Sunwoo.

378
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:35,795
Well, well...
What's a great guy like you...

379
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,767
...doing in a place like this, huh?

380
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:46,269
Oh my, you fucked up
pretty bad, didn't you?

381
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:51,110
Do you know what you're doing now?

382
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:57,776
Shit, fucking rotten.

383
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,914
Don't waste time,
just get rid of him.

384
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:50,639
This is really gross.

385
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:56,539
Where's the cocky Mr. Kim now?

386
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:01,915
Smile, like a professional. Smile.

387
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:09,319
We'll never forget about this.

388
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:22,301
You have no idea what's happening.

389
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,918
Keep your fucking head down, asshole!

390
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,404
Why'd you do it?

391
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:40,179
Why didn't you just call me?

392
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,180
It's not like you.

393
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:46,554
So what was the reason?

394
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,727
Don't feel like talking?

395
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,128
Want it to end like this?

396
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,230
This is how things work
in this business.

397
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:37,667
Don't blame anybody.

398
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:44,511
The world's a funny place.

399
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:49,785
You know what?

400
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:53,380
People don't matter for shit.

401
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,720
No one can ever see
what's coming next.

402
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,195
What are you going to do?

403
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,930
Relax and just sit tight.

404
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:05,259
Mr. Moon.

405
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:13,575
Yes, sir. Okay.

406
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,143
The boss is giving you a chance.

407
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,644
Why didn't you tell me?

408
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:28,555
Why did you make that mistake?

409
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:36,889
If the two of them
never meet again...

410
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:39,226
Go on.

411
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:47,469
If they can keep that promise,
I thought it would be best.

412
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:53,809
No... not that kind of thing.
Tell me the real reason.

413
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,519
Just be honest.

414
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:03,222
Was it because of her?

415
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,790
What?

416
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,328
You can't say?

417
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,531
Put Moon back on.

418
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,438
Yes, sir. Okay.

419
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:23,912
Yes.

420
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,173
Okay, sir.

421
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,014
Grab his arms.

422
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,115
Hey, what are you doing?

423
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:33,883
- Let me go, asshole.
- Bring it here.

424
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:37,185
What are you doing?

425
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:41,486
Let me go,

426
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:48,326
Hey! Hey, Moon.

427
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,804
Don't do this. Don't.

428
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:01,109
- Don't do this.
- Hold him tight.

429
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,604
Hey, Moon!!

430
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:09,316
Hey! Moon, ah, Moon, Moon.

431
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:23,331
Moon, don't do this.

432
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,594
You...

433
00:59:43,296 --> 00:59:47,027
Was the hole too shallow?

434
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:50,702
Congratulations, anyway.
You survived.

435
01:00:47,229 --> 01:00:51,029
There's a present for you
in the bag. Open it.

436
01:00:54,236 --> 01:00:57,000
Don't play games
with another man's life.

437
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:03,775
Ha-ha. You asshole.

438
01:01:03,845 --> 01:01:08,077
You're trying to be cool
to the end, huh?

439
01:01:12,788 --> 01:01:13,880
Is this cool?

440
01:01:21,363 --> 01:01:24,298
Do as I say, asshole.

441
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,001
He says you have 15 minutes.

442
01:01:34,743 --> 01:01:37,974
Call him as soon as you figure out
what you should say.

443
01:01:44,085 --> 01:01:46,485
Remember what happened
with Young-duk back then?

444
01:01:49,057 --> 01:01:52,322
You probably told him
something like this...

445
01:01:54,296 --> 01:01:58,027
"No turning back.
Just accept it. "

446
01:01:59,201 --> 01:02:01,465
And you just cut his wrist.

447
01:02:02,237 --> 01:02:04,102
It was awesome.

448
01:02:09,778 --> 01:02:13,942
Spend your 15 minutes wisely.
Don't disappoint the boss.

449
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,880
You owe him your life.

450
01:02:18,386 --> 01:02:25,883
They're probably digging the hole
three times deeper this time.

451
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:37,233
Here.

452
01:04:22,143 --> 01:04:26,239
Yes, I see.

453
01:04:36,091 --> 01:04:43,259
Did you beg for forgiveness?
So this is how it ends.

454
01:04:43,331 --> 01:04:46,789
You're one lucky bastard.

455
01:04:47,569 --> 01:04:49,093
Give it here.

456
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:58,910
What's this?
There's no battery!

457
01:06:52,494 --> 01:06:54,018
Step back.

458
01:08:33,328 --> 01:08:36,820
Stop digging.
We're so fucked.

459
01:09:42,597 --> 01:09:46,931
Oh, those little shits.
Like they haven't done enough.

460
01:09:47,001 --> 01:09:48,730
They're worse than we are.

461
01:09:48,803 --> 01:09:50,703
Seems you have a lot of guests.

462
01:09:50,772 --> 01:09:52,171
Yes.

463
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:56,370
He wants to run again...

464
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:01,448
Anyway, I heard the news.

465
01:10:03,251 --> 01:10:05,310
How did this happen?

466
01:10:07,655 --> 01:10:09,850
It's a long story...

467
01:10:09,924 --> 01:10:16,056
You should have just left it
to us from the beginning.

468
01:10:23,504 --> 01:10:25,802
I'm sorry. I was rude.

469
01:10:25,873 --> 01:10:29,138
No, it's mostly my fault.

470
01:10:29,644 --> 01:10:33,102
If the hammer is light,
the nail will rise back up.

471
01:10:37,618 --> 01:10:40,519
Let's get things straight.

472
01:10:40,588 --> 01:10:43,887
What would you like us
to do for you?

473
01:10:58,506 --> 01:11:04,445
Years ago, a smart young man
was working for me.

474
01:11:05,113 --> 01:11:08,048
One day I got him to do a simple job.

475
01:11:08,116 --> 01:11:11,210
I guess he thought it was
no big deal. He made a mistake.

476
01:11:11,886 --> 01:11:16,152
Thinking about it now,
it wasn't such a serious mistake.

477
01:11:16,224 --> 01:11:18,818
I could have just told him off
and let it go.

478
01:11:18,893 --> 01:11:22,294
But he was kind of strange.

479
01:11:22,363 --> 01:11:25,161
He wouldn't admit
it was his fault.

480
01:11:25,233 --> 01:11:27,997
He said he didn't do
anything wrong.

481
01:11:28,636 --> 01:11:31,764
He could've been right.
It might have been my fault.

482
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:36,742
But what are families for?

483
01:11:36,811 --> 01:11:39,712
If the boss says you're wrong,
then you're wrong...

484
01:11:39,814 --> 01:11:43,011
...even if you didn't really do it.

485
01:11:44,919 --> 01:11:47,387
Then it's over. Period!

486
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:50,322
But that guy lost his hand.

487
01:11:51,259 --> 01:11:57,129
One promising guy's life ended
just like that one morning.

488
01:12:04,806 --> 01:12:08,401
This time, one hand is not enough.

489
01:12:12,313 --> 01:12:15,180
Hello? Just a second.

490
01:12:15,249 --> 01:12:16,648
Min-gi!

491
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:24,485
Yes, hello.

492
01:12:31,599 --> 01:12:37,128
Yes, I see.

493
01:13:54,815 --> 01:13:56,680
Yes, President Won.

494
01:13:57,318 --> 01:13:59,878
Don't you think it's been enough?

495
01:14:00,655 --> 01:14:02,054
Are you all right?

496
01:14:02,723 --> 01:14:04,486
Do I look all right?

497
01:14:04,992 --> 01:14:07,256
He used to have a good reputation,
didn't he?

498
01:14:07,328 --> 01:14:11,924
What about you?
Does your reputation fit you?

499
01:14:11,999 --> 01:14:14,160
Why are you doing this?

500
01:14:14,769 --> 01:14:17,704
I guess I misjudged him.

501
01:14:17,772 --> 01:14:19,797
What are you going to do?

502
01:14:21,108 --> 01:14:22,541
I don't know.

503
01:14:23,844 --> 01:14:26,369
Reasons don't matter anymore.

504
01:14:27,048 --> 01:14:28,948
I don't know...

505
01:14:31,852 --> 01:14:34,946
I guess I'm going to put an end
to this anyway.

506
01:14:35,022 --> 01:14:37,286
I'll see it to the end...

507
01:15:17,832 --> 01:15:19,390
Who is it?

508
01:15:22,603 --> 01:15:23,831
Who is it?

509
01:16:04,245 --> 01:16:05,906
Let's see the money first.

510
01:16:07,381 --> 01:16:10,646
Will this be okay?
Check if this is shady money.

511
01:16:10,718 --> 01:16:13,778
Wait. Let me see
what kind of guy this is.

512
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:19,986
What are you going to use it for?

513
01:16:22,963 --> 01:16:24,931
Do I have to tell you all that?

514
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,165
If we can't be sure,
we can't give it to you...

515
01:16:27,234 --> 01:16:29,668
No matter how much money
you pay.

516
01:16:30,304 --> 01:16:32,135
We gonna make a deal or what?

517
01:16:36,477 --> 01:16:38,274
What shall we do?

518
01:16:38,746 --> 01:16:45,447
I can't figure out this guy.

519
01:16:45,519 --> 01:16:48,647
What if he's a rat for the cops?

520
01:16:48,723 --> 01:16:50,213
Are you sure he's not a rat?

521
01:16:50,291 --> 01:16:52,725
Dammit! Don't yell in my ear.

522
01:16:52,793 --> 01:16:55,159
Hold on...

523
01:16:57,498 --> 01:16:59,830
Let me think.

524
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:05,733
Tell him to come tomorrow by 4.

525
01:17:05,806 --> 01:17:07,273
With the money.

526
01:17:08,476 --> 01:17:11,570
Mikhail, if it were you,
would you come again?

527
01:17:12,046 --> 01:17:13,070
Damn it!

528
01:17:13,147 --> 01:17:15,274
Why are you saying
my name?

529
01:17:15,349 --> 01:17:18,216
We said we wouldn't use names.
You moron!

530
01:17:18,285 --> 01:17:20,810
How would you like it
if I said your name is Myung-gu?

531
01:17:20,888 --> 01:17:24,153
How would you like it, asshole?

532
01:17:24,225 --> 01:17:25,590
What? Asshole?

533
01:17:25,659 --> 01:17:27,092
Yes, asshole,
I said you're an asshole!

534
01:17:27,161 --> 01:17:31,655
Damn you bastard,
come here just a second.

535
01:17:31,966 --> 01:17:36,198
Are you going to screw with me?
Try it, you idiot.

536
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:44,435
Ah, ok, ok.

537
01:17:46,881 --> 01:17:49,349
Bastard. Go back to your country!

538
01:17:51,051 --> 01:17:55,385
So useless...

539
01:18:06,801 --> 01:18:09,201
Come here by 4 o'clock tomorrow.

540
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:10,328
You have to come alone.

541
01:18:10,404 --> 01:18:14,670
Is there anyone
who can vouch for you?

542
01:18:14,742 --> 01:18:17,506
We can't give you anything
unless we're sure about you.

543
01:18:17,578 --> 01:18:21,446
Find someone by tomorrow
who can vouch for you.

544
01:18:22,783 --> 01:18:25,479
All right, see you tomorrow.

545
01:18:41,635 --> 01:18:42,897
Damn...

546
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:44,460
Hey, watch it!

547
01:18:44,538 --> 01:18:46,199
Just shut up.

548
01:18:51,579 --> 01:18:53,479
What's this?
I don't recognize this number.

549
01:18:53,547 --> 01:18:55,276
Hey, Myung-gu, Myung-gu!

550
01:18:55,349 --> 01:18:57,476
Hello!

551
01:19:38,225 --> 01:19:40,318
Here's a new face!

552
01:19:40,394 --> 01:19:42,123
Who did you say referred you?

553
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:44,525
President Han introduced me.

554
01:19:44,598 --> 01:19:45,587
President Han?

555
01:19:46,534 --> 01:19:47,796
Which President Han?

556
01:19:48,802 --> 01:19:50,201
He says it's President Han
from Gyungsan.

557
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,761
Aha! Han Sang-shik...

558
01:19:53,073 --> 01:19:55,268
What's your connection with him?

559
01:19:55,342 --> 01:19:59,039
He supplies our place
with Russian dancers.

560
01:20:00,981 --> 01:20:02,209
A nightclub, is it?

561
01:20:02,283 --> 01:20:03,409
Yes.

562
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:07,650
I see. But why do you
need our merchandise?

563
01:20:07,721 --> 01:20:10,656
I'm just following orders,
so I don't know the specifics.

564
01:20:12,793 --> 01:20:14,556
What happened to your face?

565
01:20:17,364 --> 01:20:19,423
Have you used this sort of
Merchandise before?

566
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,364
Yes.

567
01:20:20,434 --> 01:20:21,594
Where?

568
01:20:22,236 --> 01:20:23,794
I used to be a bodyguard.

569
01:20:23,871 --> 01:20:25,133
You're a novice.

570
01:20:25,205 --> 01:20:27,366
Well, I'm not the one
who'll be using it, so...

571
01:20:27,441 --> 01:20:29,272
You know how to take apart
a gun and put it back together?

572
01:20:29,343 --> 01:20:30,537
I've done it before.

573
01:20:30,611 --> 01:20:31,441
Hey.

574
01:20:31,512 --> 01:20:33,173
Hey, bring the guns over here.

575
01:21:09,249 --> 01:21:10,944
Have you...

576
01:21:11,018 --> 01:21:12,576
Have you ever seen anything
like this?

577
01:21:14,154 --> 01:21:14,677
This is...

578
01:21:14,755 --> 01:21:17,747
probably different
from what you used.

579
01:21:18,325 --> 01:21:22,455
The finest gun manufactured
in Russia.

580
01:21:24,431 --> 01:21:28,527
The Stechkin Automatic Pistol.

581
01:21:28,602 --> 01:21:30,695
The KGB boys used to use it.

582
01:21:31,872 --> 01:21:33,362
You brought the money?

583
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:43,639
Just a moment.

584
01:21:45,252 --> 01:21:48,187
I think we need
to check you out first.

585
01:21:50,424 --> 01:21:52,051
I told you already.

586
01:21:52,126 --> 01:21:54,219
I heard what you said, but...

587
01:21:54,728 --> 01:21:57,356
I'd like to hear what
Han Sang-shik has to say.

588
01:21:57,431 --> 01:22:00,025
Hey, give Mr. Han a call...

589
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:04,059
On your way back,
bring the rapid-fire magazines.

590
01:22:04,138 --> 01:22:05,605
It will only take a second.

591
01:22:27,494 --> 01:22:30,930
Want me to teach you
how to use it while we wait?

592
01:22:30,998 --> 01:22:33,990
All right, now watch me
and do what I do.

593
01:22:34,068 --> 01:22:36,195
You have to be able to do this
to teach others how to use them.

594
01:22:41,942 --> 01:22:43,102
Okay, look.

595
01:22:51,418 --> 01:22:52,112
See?

596
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:54,647
Fast, fast, fast.

597
01:22:55,723 --> 01:22:57,418
Take a good look.

598
01:22:57,491 --> 01:22:58,617
Now, first...

599
01:22:58,692 --> 01:23:00,990
unscrew this...

600
01:23:01,061 --> 01:23:04,690
then push this up and in.

601
01:23:04,765 --> 01:23:06,255
Easy, huh? Next...

602
01:23:06,333 --> 01:23:08,301
load the magazine...

603
01:23:08,368 --> 01:23:09,960
And then... bang.

604
01:23:13,173 --> 01:23:14,504
Simple, isn't it?

605
01:23:14,575 --> 01:23:17,100
Try one more time. Here.

606
01:23:25,953 --> 01:23:28,387
Okay, let's see how well
you were watching.

607
01:23:28,455 --> 01:23:29,547
They said they'll call back right away.

608
01:23:29,623 --> 01:23:30,749
Alright, alright, one second.

609
01:23:30,824 --> 01:23:32,189
Hey, look at this.

610
01:23:32,259 --> 01:23:36,127
Let's start at the same time,
okay?

611
01:23:36,196 --> 01:23:39,256
Hey, no bullets. Ready?

612
01:23:39,333 --> 01:23:41,267
One, two, three.

613
01:23:55,883 --> 01:23:58,374
Damn.

614
01:24:00,487 --> 01:24:03,047
Hello? Who?

615
01:24:03,123 --> 01:24:04,647
Ah, Mr. Han.

616
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:09,426
You sent me someone?

617
01:24:09,496 --> 01:24:12,795
You know, the errand guy.

618
01:24:14,301 --> 01:24:15,461
Huh?

619
01:25:07,221 --> 01:25:10,054
What's with him? Drunk again?

620
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:15,447
Brother!

621
01:26:15,522 --> 01:26:17,990
Why aren't you answering?

622
01:26:18,058 --> 01:26:19,423
You not around?

623
01:26:19,493 --> 01:26:21,290
I just arrived.

624
01:26:21,361 --> 01:26:22,988
I'm bringing the merchandise.

625
01:26:23,063 --> 01:26:25,190
I'll be there in about an hour.

626
01:26:25,265 --> 01:26:26,425
See you then.

627
01:27:04,004 --> 01:27:06,996
Stop staring at me
and call President Baek.

628
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:12,205
I don't have much time.

629
01:28:35,962 --> 01:28:38,430
What are you doing?
Hurry up man...

630
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:42,462
The ice rink, right?

631
01:28:43,837 --> 01:28:46,397
I've been waiting here forever.

632
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:51,105
Call me right away when you get
this message.

633
01:28:57,617 --> 01:28:59,983
Damn, it's fucking cold in here.

634
01:29:31,885 --> 01:29:33,580
Surprised?

635
01:29:33,653 --> 01:29:38,556
Thought you'd never
see me again? Smile.

636
01:29:41,595 --> 01:29:44,564
Hey, let's be professional.

637
01:29:44,631 --> 01:29:50,160
I thought about it, and lots of
people have bad memories, right?

638
01:29:50,237 --> 01:29:53,263
Memories that can never
be erased, no matter what.

639
01:29:54,474 --> 01:29:57,375
But at least you can erase
the traces...

640
01:29:57,444 --> 01:29:59,435
I mean, the people who caused
those memories.

641
01:29:59,913 --> 01:30:01,847
What are you talking about?

642
01:30:01,915 --> 01:30:05,817
Life is full of all kinds of shit.
Why are you acting like a child?

643
01:30:05,886 --> 01:30:08,855
I'm saying that you're just
a shitty memory for me.

644
01:30:08,922 --> 01:30:09,854
And I'm...

645
01:30:14,628 --> 01:30:16,755
oh, never mind.
Let me ask you one thing.

646
01:30:17,931 --> 01:30:19,831
Why did you do that to me?

647
01:30:25,405 --> 01:30:28,397
Oh for fuck's sake...

648
01:30:35,549 --> 01:30:37,107
Hey, Mr. Sunwoo...

649
01:30:39,286 --> 01:30:41,186
You bastard.

650
01:30:42,956 --> 01:30:45,015
Damn, you piece of shit!

651
01:30:46,927 --> 01:30:49,225
You fucking asshole!

652
01:30:49,930 --> 01:30:52,592
You thought I was an amateur?

653
01:30:58,138 --> 01:31:00,766
What's that supposed to mean?

654
01:31:01,308 --> 01:31:05,074
You think it's unfair? Unfair?

655
01:31:06,413 --> 01:31:08,574
Can't you figure out
the reason for all this?

656
01:31:08,648 --> 01:31:11,139
You keep looking
in all the wrong places.

657
01:31:11,218 --> 01:31:14,153
Then you shouldn't have come to me.

658
01:31:17,524 --> 01:31:19,458
Life is about suffering.

659
01:31:19,526 --> 01:31:20,788
Didn't you know that?

660
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:23,021
Hey you, stand up straight.
Straight.

661
01:31:23,096 --> 01:31:26,463
I'll teach you a lesson.
Stand up straight.

662
01:31:30,370 --> 01:31:32,065
Just a moment. Wait.

663
01:32:01,868 --> 01:32:03,335
Damn.

664
01:32:07,974 --> 01:32:09,373
Ah, fuck.

665
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:18,915
What was that?

666
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,615
Oh, hi, how are you?

667
01:32:24,157 --> 01:32:27,183
Did you hear some kind of bang?

668
01:32:27,994 --> 01:32:30,155
The sound of a hole
being ripped out of life.

669
01:32:30,230 --> 01:32:33,222
Huh? Oh, okay.

670
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:36,701
Things are tough these days.
Everyone's having hard times.

671
01:32:36,770 --> 01:32:38,795
It's getting cold.
Winter's coming.

672
01:32:38,872 --> 01:32:40,032
It's too damn hard to live.

673
01:32:40,106 --> 01:32:42,973
I wonder what the politicians
are doing for us.

674
01:32:43,043 --> 01:32:48,310
Because of the new bus-only lanes,
Driving downtown is harder.

675
01:32:48,381 --> 01:32:50,941
Mister, please take me downtown.

676
01:32:51,418 --> 01:32:52,715
Oh, okay.

677
01:33:03,496 --> 01:33:08,695
You messed with the wrong guy.
Watch yourself.

678
01:33:22,849 --> 01:33:23,781
Damn.

679
01:33:25,785 --> 01:33:26,945
Untie the ropes.

680
01:33:36,963 --> 01:33:37,827
Bring me a phone.

681
01:33:37,897 --> 01:33:38,556
What?

682
01:33:38,631 --> 01:33:40,826
Bring me a phone, you asshole!

683
01:34:06,893 --> 01:34:09,123
I'll make it short.

684
01:34:11,598 --> 01:34:13,498
You've seen Sunwoo, right?

685
01:34:16,369 --> 01:34:18,098
You mean Mr. Kim?

686
01:34:18,605 --> 01:34:19,765
That's right, Manager Kim.

687
01:34:19,839 --> 01:34:22,433
You haven't seen him lately,
have you? Where is he?

688
01:34:23,476 --> 01:34:25,671
How would I know?

689
01:34:50,937 --> 01:34:54,600
Hey Mi-ae. I'm on my way now.

690
01:34:56,242 --> 01:34:57,174
Yes.

691
01:35:02,715 --> 01:35:05,513
[1 Missed Call: KIM Sunwoo]

692
01:35:17,697 --> 01:35:20,860
Get out. Hurry up!

693
01:35:20,934 --> 01:35:22,595
Hey! Hurry up!

694
01:36:01,808 --> 01:36:05,107
I'll be downstairs.
So call me if something happens.

695
01:36:18,258 --> 01:36:23,696
Here. That guy dropped this off
and just left.

696
01:37:38,705 --> 01:37:40,400
How did it get to this point?

697
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:48,504
It's okay.

698
01:37:50,383 --> 01:37:52,283
It's okay...

699
01:38:12,672 --> 01:38:14,435
Moon Suk.

700
01:38:15,942 --> 01:38:17,432
Who's that?

701
01:39:52,472 --> 01:39:54,372
You can't come this way, sir.

702
01:41:32,772 --> 01:41:35,138
Let's not make a fuss.

703
01:41:36,809 --> 01:41:38,504
This is my last stop.

704
01:41:40,046 --> 01:41:41,911
I've nowhere to go.

705
01:41:57,029 --> 01:42:00,863
You really want to take it this far?

706
01:42:02,501 --> 01:42:04,560
Why did you do that to me?

707
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:10,841
Tell me why.

708
01:42:12,411 --> 01:42:15,175
You insulted me.

709
01:42:15,748 --> 01:42:19,707
No, not that kind of thing.
Tell me the real reason.

710
01:42:25,424 --> 01:42:26,982
Tell me.

711
01:42:28,895 --> 01:42:35,357
I've been thinking about this
a lot, and I still don't get it.

712
01:42:38,170 --> 01:42:43,802
Tell me, how did we come to this?

713
01:42:46,212 --> 01:42:48,112
How did this happen?

714
01:42:48,347 --> 01:42:51,214
Were you really going to kill me?

715
01:42:53,185 --> 01:42:56,348
Were you really?

716
01:42:56,422 --> 01:43:01,951
I've served you like a dog,
for 7 years.

717
01:43:02,862 --> 01:43:04,523
Say me something.

718
01:43:05,464 --> 01:43:07,955
Anything. Tell me!

719
01:43:49,942 --> 01:43:54,470
What's gotten into you?

720
01:43:57,650 --> 01:43:59,413
Was it because of her?

721
01:44:17,570 --> 01:44:19,094
Don't do this.

722
01:45:10,289 --> 01:45:13,918
But we can't turn back
time now, can we?

723
01:51:20,526 --> 01:51:22,016
Hello?

724
01:51:27,966 --> 01:51:30,833
Hello?

725
01:52:10,642 --> 01:52:12,735
This is too harsh...

726
01:54:36,021 --> 01:54:41,584
One late autumn night,
the disciple woke up crying.

727
01:54:41,927 --> 01:54:47,160
So the master asked the disciple...

728
01:54:48,033 --> 01:54:52,299
- "Did you have a nightmare?"
- "No. "

729
01:54:52,371 --> 01:54:54,839
"Did you have a sad dream?"

730
01:54:54,906 --> 01:54:57,170
"No," said the disciple.

731
01:54:57,242 --> 01:54:59,767
"I had a sweet dream. "

732
01:55:00,679 --> 01:55:03,705
Then why are you crying so sadly?

733
01:55:03,782 --> 01:55:09,152
The disciple answered quietly,
while wiping his tears...

734
01:55:10,222 --> 01:55:14,818
"Because the dream
I had can't come true. "

735
01:56:14,819 --> 01:56:17,619
