1
00:01:06,404 --> 00:01:07,701
Dia.

2
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,176
English boys don't go
to school every day.

3
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:48,929
Teacher say this country
was founded as a utopia.

4
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:51,666
Do you know
what that word means, Papa?

5
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:54,208
Well, she says someday
when the war is over...

6
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:56,778
...our world will be a paradise.

7
00:02:56,947 --> 00:02:59,313
And all this you learn in one day?

8
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:01,610
And math and science.

9
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:05,854
This is too much learning. Tomorrow,
you will stay home and mend the nets, yes?

10
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:07,149
No, Papa.

11
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:09,622
What? So now you want
to go to school every day?

12
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:44,550
- Stay.
- Papa.

13
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:46,127
- Stay!
- Papa!

14
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,792
Jassie!

15
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:25,825
Solomon.

16
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:40,516
Come, come, come.

17
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:47,621
Pick it up. Quick.

18
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:51,053
- Papa! Papa!
- Jassie.

19
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:54,129
- Dia, run!
- Papa!

20
00:04:57,268 --> 00:05:01,295
- Papa! Papa!
- Dia, run!

21
00:05:01,472 --> 00:05:03,565
Papa!

22
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:21,791
Bring forward the next one. Bastard.

23
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,620
Bring forward the next one.

24
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:27,728
- Long sleeve or short sleeve?
- No.

25
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:31,728
Young man. You must understand.

26
00:05:31,902 --> 00:05:34,564
The government wants you to vote, okay?

27
00:05:34,738 --> 00:05:38,401
They gonna tell you say,
"The future is in your hands."

28
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:40,806
We now the future.

29
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:42,570
So we take your hands.

30
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:45,180
- No.
- No more hands, no more voting.

31
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:48,680
Chop him.

32
00:05:52,356 --> 00:05:56,292
Spread the word.
The Revolutionary United Front is coming.

33
00:05:57,828 --> 00:06:02,128
- RUF!
- RUF! RUF!

34
00:06:03,968 --> 00:06:07,631
Bring forward the next one.
Bring him forward. Bring him forward.

35
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:12,434
Long sleeve or short sleeve?

36
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:15,343
- Short sleeve!
- Chop him.

37
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,872
Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

38
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:21,708
Not this one. Look at him.

39
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:24,210
- Put him in the truck.
- Let's go.

40
00:06:24,388 --> 00:06:25,787
Bring him to the mines.

41
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:28,117
He can work. He can work.
Move, move, move.

42
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:30,055
Next one, next one, next one.

43
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:37,226
<i>Throughout the history of Africa...</i>

44
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,931
...whenever a substance
of value is found...

45
00:06:42,272 --> 00:06:44,638
...the locals die
in great number and in misery.

46
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:50,511
Now, this was true of ivory,
rubber, gold and oil.

47
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:52,080
It is now true of diamonds.

48
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:57,712
<i>According to a devastating report
by Global Witness...</i>

49
00:06:57,888 --> 00:07:02,723
<i>...these stones are being used
to purchase arms and finance civil war.</i>

50
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:05,691
We must act to prohibit...

51
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:10,197
...the direct or indirect import
of all rough diamonds from conflict zones.

52
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,829
<i>May I remind you...</i>

53
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:22,945
...that the U.S. is responsible for two-thirds
of all diamond purchases worldwide...

54
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:26,708
<i>...and I don't anticipate
that demand diminishing.</i>

55
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:29,115
<i>We must remember
that these stones...</i>

56
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:34,246
<i>...comprise only a small percentage
of the legitimate diamond industry...</i>

57
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:39,294
...whose trade is crucial to the economies
of many emerging nations.

58
00:07:39,463 --> 00:07:42,728
The Freetown government
and their white masters...

59
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,528
...have raped your land
to feed their greed.

60
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:47,796
RUF have freed you.

61
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:51,304
<i>- No more slave and master here.
- It's true.</i>

62
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:56,572
Current estimates are that conflict stones
account for only 15 percent of the market.

63
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:59,147
But in a multi-billion-dollar-a-year
industry...

64
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:02,376
...that means hundreds of millions
of dollars are available...

65
00:08:02,553 --> 00:08:04,453
...for weapons in these conflict zones.

66
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:07,089
RUF is fighting for the people!

67
00:08:07,257 --> 00:08:10,021
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

68
00:08:10,194 --> 00:08:15,063
Any bastard think he would joke
with me diamond, I go cut he throat.

69
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:18,393
Stop!

70
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:23,835
And we are joined today
by members of that diamond industry...

71
00:08:24,341 --> 00:08:27,640
...who wholeheartedly
endorse your proposal.

72
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:31,474
I hope you join me
in applauding their presence here.

73
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:34,913
Mr. Van De Kaap and Mr. Simmons.

74
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:45,522
Give it to me.

75
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:22,361
Don't worry. We'll be fine, huh?

76
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:26,902
Listen. You take off
as soon as I'm out the door.

77
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,504
You don't land
until I raise you on the sat phone.

78
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:32,336
You be careful, Danny.

79
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:37,037
Don't worry. They want these guns
too much to do anything stupid.

80
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:52,919
Where is Commander Zero?

81
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:57,259
I am Captain Rambo.

82
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:01,667
Right. Right, I've seen your films, huh?

83
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,309
I'm looking for Commander Zero, huh?

84
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:09,308
He's inside. You talk to me.

85
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:12,448
You are here to help us
in our struggle against the government.

86
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:15,176
I'm here to do business
with Commander Zero, all right?

87
00:10:31,602 --> 00:10:33,001
All right.

88
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:37,402
You are the man, huh?
You are the man.

89
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,738
Here, huh?

90
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,759
Hey. I'm talking to you! Stop!

91
00:10:56,927 --> 00:10:58,986
- Commander Zero.
- Hey.

92
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:01,824
- I go kill you, eh?
- It's fine, huh? It's fine.

93
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:05,628
Commander Zero. Commander Zero.

94
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:08,828
Mr. Archer, come here.

95
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:17,608
You get something for me?

96
00:11:17,781 --> 00:11:20,375
And yourself get something for me, huh?

97
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:24,849
Are you craze?
You get for pay me first for them.

98
00:11:43,307 --> 00:11:44,797
This no fine, huh?

99
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:46,340
This no fine.

100
00:11:53,383 --> 00:11:54,816
...and their new weapons, huh?

101
00:11:54,985 --> 00:11:57,283
Maybe I could kill you
and take what you bring.

102
00:11:57,454 --> 00:11:59,354
Then you get one more dead body...

103
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:02,185
...instead of airplane
way full with grenade launchers.

104
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,355
So I'm think I'm gonna go
to them government.

105
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,963
Them government,
at least them go pay me, huh?

106
00:12:08,131 --> 00:12:10,998
Wait, wait. Wait, my friend.

107
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:17,336
This is the thing you want? Here.

108
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:19,668
So many I not know
what to do with them all.

109
00:12:20,277 --> 00:12:23,337
Hey, Archer, next time,
you bring satellite TV, eh?

110
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:26,277
<i>- I wanna see Baywatch.
- Yeah.</i>

111
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,917
Yeah. Yeah.

112
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,365
Hello, hello, hello.

113
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,507
Papers, please.

114
00:12:56,913 --> 00:12:58,904
<i>Danny Archer, National Geographic.</i>

115
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:03,616
You crossing into Liberia.

116
00:13:03,787 --> 00:13:07,416
I've got a letter from the minister of interior
and a Liberian visa as well.

117
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:10,059
I'm doing a story on the Marrakaz,
who, as you know...

118
00:13:10,227 --> 00:13:13,560
...are allowed to cross the border
in order to get into grazing grounds.

119
00:13:14,031 --> 00:13:16,056
<i>You ever read National Geographic, huh?</i>

120
00:13:57,507 --> 00:13:59,771
- You're under arrest for smuggling.
- No, no, no.

121
00:13:59,943 --> 00:14:02,639
Listen here, my friend.
Listen here, all right?

122
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:05,281
I am good friends
with Colonel Coetzee.

123
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:09,751
Colonel Coetzee would not be pleased
that you've interfered with his business.

124
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,649
Now, you know who I am, all right?

125
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:14,689
You don't wanna make trouble for me
or my friends, all right?

126
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:18,555
Now, look, why don't I just
look the other way, all right?

127
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:22,357
You take one or two of those stones
and get something lacquer for the wife...

128
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:26,366
...or maybe the mistress, all right?
We'll solve the problem right here, huh?

129
00:14:27,104 --> 00:14:29,800
We'll go back to Freetown
and ask Colonel Coetzee...

130
00:14:29,973 --> 00:14:32,965
...how he wishes
to thank his business associate.

131
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:34,804
Guys, take him away.

132
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:23,688
Hey! What the fuck?
What's going on there?

133
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,725
Come on! Fix that shit now!

134
00:15:25,896 --> 00:15:29,161
Wasting my time here!
What in the shit is that?

135
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:32,993
Fuck that stuff! Fix that shit!
Damn, now need to work.

136
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,104
- Can't work. What's going on there?
- Boss.

137
00:15:35,272 --> 00:15:38,139
- Fix that thing.
- I wanna go toilet. I must go now, now.

138
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:41,607
- I can't hold it in, boss.
- Go, go.

139
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:43,913
Get to work. Go to work, go to work.

140
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,176
Fuckheads wasting my time now.
How am I work in this shit?

141
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,957
Stop!

142
00:15:57,027 --> 00:15:58,961
Spread your fingers.

143
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,529
Open.

144
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:18,710
Make it quick.

145
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:56,313
Give it to me.

146
00:16:59,022 --> 00:17:00,614
Give it to me.

147
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:03,292
The government troops are coming!

148
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:10,831
Go, go, go--!

00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:43,263
No, no, no!

159
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:04,478
Hey.

160
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:07,049
What did you do with it?

161
00:19:07,217 --> 00:19:09,344
I'm talking to you, you hear me?

162
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,948
Where the diamond? The pink one.

163
00:19:14,124 --> 00:19:16,888
- I saw you take it.
- You're mad. I do not know you.

164
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,996
Liar! I saw it with my own eyes.

165
00:19:21,865 --> 00:19:25,801
This big. Biggest I have ever seen.

166
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,569
My brothers, I go give $1000...

167
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,198
...to the man who cuts the diamond
out of this bastard.

168
00:19:34,377 --> 00:19:37,835
You the craze! You the craze!

169
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:39,641
Where is the diamond?

170
00:19:39,816 --> 00:19:43,013
Where is the diamond?
Do you see a diamond?

171
00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:48,956
You devils have taken my family!
My home! I done lost everything!

172
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:53,287
Here, look. What is left?

173
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:55,363
What is left?

174
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:58,194
If there is a diamond,
you are the one who has taken it!

175
00:19:58,368 --> 00:20:00,336
Liar! The man is a liar!

176
00:20:01,004 --> 00:20:04,770
I know your name, Solomon Vandy!
You have a name!

177
00:20:04,941 --> 00:20:09,037
You have a family!
And I'll catch them!

178
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:11,009
And I'll find them!

179
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:30,993
<i>Please tell me you brought me
cigarettes, bru, please.</i>

180
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,600
I just have to tell you, Danny.

181
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:35,795
The colonel's not going to be happy
about you losing the diamonds.

182
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:38,839
Forget the colonel.
There's a fisherman in there, all right?

183
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:41,636
He might've found a pink. Big one.

184
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:43,938
What about the colonel?
He'll want that stone.

185
00:20:44,113 --> 00:20:46,581
Screw the colonel.
I'll contact our friends in London.

186
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:50,583
If this stone is as big as I think,
we're gonna need a real buyer, all right?

187
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:53,852
What? What?

188
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:56,719
London wants nothing more
to do with you.

189
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,424
"Arrest in Sierra Leone of Daniel Archer,
former mercenary and smuggler..."

190
00:21:01,598 --> 00:21:04,226
"Retains close ties
to Van De Kaap diamond cartel.

191
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,528
Sources say they deny
any affiliation whatso--"

192
00:21:07,704 --> 00:21:09,797
Fucking hell.

193
00:21:11,274 --> 00:21:13,367
Listen, his name
is Solomon Vandy, all right?

194
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:17,206
Van De Kaap is gonna want that stone,
whatever they say. You just get him out.

195
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,972
Get him out.

196
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:26,887
Yeah, can you tell Mr. Simmons
that Danny Archer called. Right.

197
00:21:27,323 --> 00:21:31,054
Archer. A-R-C-H-E-R.

198
00:21:55,218 --> 00:21:56,879
Afternoon, darling, huh?

199
00:21:57,053 --> 00:22:00,955
Big white man all alone.
That is no fine.

200
00:22:01,124 --> 00:22:05,584
- I'm safe, huh? No HIV.
- Yeah, yeah. I've heard that one before.

201
00:22:05,762 --> 00:22:09,027
Archer, I know where to get
nice baby diamond just for you.

202
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:11,098
- Not now, next time.
- Come on, Archer.

203
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:13,565
I said not now, next time. Bugger off.

204
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:07,588
Solomon Vandy?

205
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:10,456
What do you want?

206
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:13,494
It seems you made a friend in prison.

207
00:23:38,588 --> 00:23:40,818
- Hey.
- How the body, Mr. Archer?

208
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,787
The body fine, M'Ed.

209
00:23:47,997 --> 00:23:49,760
So you want something nice, huh?

210
00:23:50,366 --> 00:23:53,130
The best you can get ahold of, all right?

211
00:23:53,302 --> 00:23:56,829
Take me a few days,
but I go find you something special.

212
00:23:57,006 --> 00:23:59,839
All right. You hear
they took Marampa yesterday?

213
00:24:01,044 --> 00:24:02,511
- Really?
- Now, come on.

214
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:05,341
You know every move they make.
When are they gonna hit us?

215
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:09,952
Oh, I imagine they come
do some shopping very soon.

216
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:13,350
Yeah, yeah.
Got any smokes back there?

217
00:24:13,523 --> 00:24:15,081
Yeah.

218
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:25,996
Who's that, huh?

219
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,828
All right.

220
00:24:35,411 --> 00:24:39,040
- Can I offer you a cigarette?
- Oh, no, thanks.

221
00:24:39,282 --> 00:24:40,874
You listening to this?

222
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,518
<i>I am profoundly sorry.</i>

223
00:24:43,686 --> 00:24:47,247
The world is falling apart,
and all we hear about is Blowjobgate.

224
00:24:48,091 --> 00:24:49,319
<i>I believe he's sorry.</i>

225
00:24:49,492 --> 00:24:52,893
When was the last time the world
wasn't falling apart, huh?

226
00:24:54,964 --> 00:24:58,832
A cynic. Why don't you sit down
and make me miserable?

227
00:25:01,337 --> 00:25:03,532
- Danny Archer.
- Maddy Bowen.

228
00:25:03,706 --> 00:25:05,503
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

229
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:08,309
- American, huh?
- Guilty.

230
00:25:08,478 --> 00:25:10,742
Well, Americans usually are.

231
00:25:11,214 --> 00:25:13,614
Says the white South African?

232
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,641
I'm from Rhodesia.

233
00:25:18,488 --> 00:25:20,979
We say Zimbabwe now,
don't we?

234
00:25:21,157 --> 00:25:24,422
- Do we?
- Last time I checked.

235
00:25:24,594 --> 00:25:26,755
Don't tell me,
you're here to make a difference.

236
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:30,160
- And you're here to make a buck?
- I'm here for lack of a better idea.

237
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,797
- That's a shame.
- Not really.

238
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:35,233
Peace Corps types only
stay around long enough...

239
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:37,304
...to realize they're not helping anyone.

240
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:39,338
Government only wants
to stay in power...

241
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:42,410
...until they've stolen enough
to go into exile somewhere else.

242
00:25:42,578 --> 00:25:45,206
And the rebels, they're not sure
they want to take over.

243
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:47,713
Otherwise,
they'd have to govern this mess.

244
00:25:47,884 --> 00:25:50,182
- But TIA, right, M'Ed?
- TIA.

245
00:25:50,353 --> 00:25:51,581
What's TIA?

246
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:56,123
- "This is Africa," huh?
- Right.

247
00:25:56,692 --> 00:25:59,160
- You want another?
- Sure.

248
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:05,490
So which one are you?

249
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:10,234
- Smuggler?
- Am I?

250
00:26:10,406 --> 00:26:13,341
Somehow you don't strike me
as the UNICEF type.

251
00:26:14,377 --> 00:26:16,345
How about soldier of fortune?

252
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:19,373
Or is that too much of a clich?

253
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:20,880
Diamonds?

254
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:25,179
- If I told you I was a missionary...?
- For Van De Kaap?

255
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:29,483
Better watch that type of talk,
Miss Bowen.

256
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:32,753
In America, it's bling-bling,
but out here, it's bling-bang, huh?

257
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:36,157
I wouldn't want you
getting in any trouble.

258
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:39,697
How much trouble
do you think I would get into...

259
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:43,134
...for talking about blood diamonds?

260
00:26:45,942 --> 00:26:49,002
- You're a journalist.
- That's right.

261
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:54,541
Piss off, huh?

262
00:26:58,888 --> 00:27:02,153
For five years, this country has reported
almost no diamond exports...

263
00:27:02,325 --> 00:27:05,988
...while Liberia, right next door,
has exported 2 billion dollars' worth.

264
00:27:06,162 --> 00:27:09,188
Very odd, considering that Liberia
has no diamonds to speak of.

265
00:27:09,365 --> 00:27:10,354
I'm shocked.

266
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:13,866
Van De Kaap denies trading blood
diamonds, but admits it's impossible...

267
00:27:14,036 --> 00:27:18,370
...to tell where a diamond comes from
unless their smuggler gets caught.

268
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:20,236
What do you want from me, huh?

269
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:24,937
You know all about Van De Kaap.
Help me out. Off the record.

270
00:27:25,181 --> 00:27:29,641
Well, off the record, I like to get kissed
before I get fucked, huh?

271
00:27:32,221 --> 00:27:33,415
Shit.

272
00:28:06,756 --> 00:28:10,248
- Cordell. How is it, Shona?
- Long time, pal.

273
00:28:10,426 --> 00:28:13,793
- How's Alice?
- She's well, thanks.

274
00:28:13,963 --> 00:28:15,794
Tim must be in school, right?

275
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:18,297
- Big kids, big problems, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.

276
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:21,061
I heard you got into a spot of trouble
in the bush, huh?

277
00:28:21,237 --> 00:28:23,637
<i>Well, you know the bush, right, bru?</i>

278
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:26,967
- Company doing well?
- Can't complain.

279
00:28:27,143 --> 00:28:29,771
Eleven wars in the continent.
We're keeping busy.

280
00:28:29,946 --> 00:28:32,380
So, what, you're here on holiday, huh?

281
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,983
- How's the colonel?
- He sends his regards.

282
00:28:36,152 --> 00:28:39,849
Good, good. Score us a loose, huh?

283
00:28:40,957 --> 00:28:43,152
<i>Smoking will kill you, bru.</i>

284
00:28:43,426 --> 00:28:44,654
Only if I live, right?

285
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:51,899
<i>That's for breaking my TV, bru.</i>

286
00:28:56,772 --> 00:29:00,299
Tell the colonel he'll get his money.
I'll come see him soon.

287
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:08,277
Ten more.

288
00:29:08,451 --> 00:29:11,352
Come. Come.

289
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,950
Go on.

290
00:29:33,142 --> 00:29:37,078
Dia. Dia. Come here.
Get away from there.

291
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,342
Go. Go, Mama.

292
00:29:40,516 --> 00:29:42,450
Stay down.

293
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:02,230
Excuse me,
my name's Solomon Vandy--

294
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:04,498
- Check the list.
- I have checked the list.

295
00:30:04,673 --> 00:30:09,133
- File papers at the Office for Refugees.
- Sir, I have filed papers with the office.

296
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:11,302
Then God help you,
because I can't.

297
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,538
- Please, sir--
- Next.

298
00:30:12,715 --> 00:30:14,842
- Sir-- Sir, no, please.
- Hey, hey. Me, me, me.

299
00:30:15,017 --> 00:30:18,783
Husband here. One year we look.

300
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:25,453
Hurry, Mom. Go.

301
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:31,998
Dia! Dia!

302
00:30:32,168 --> 00:30:33,157
- Jassie!
- Dia!

303
00:30:33,335 --> 00:30:34,927
- Mama!
- Dia!

304
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:37,265
Jassie! Mama!

305
00:30:59,528 --> 00:31:02,361
He's been waiting.
What took you?

306
00:31:03,065 --> 00:31:06,432
What are you gonna do,
shoot me right here, huh, Shona?

307
00:31:06,602 --> 00:31:09,696
Now, don't be a wanker, man. Get in.

308
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,170
- Hello, Danny.
- Colonel.

309
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,137
You look well.

310
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:49,471
Clean living and a pure heart,
I suppose, huh?

311
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:51,507
Walk with me.

312
00:31:53,282 --> 00:31:56,115
It seems the rebels have taken back
the diamond fields, Danny.

313
00:31:56,285 --> 00:31:58,617
The government
of Sierra Leone has contracted us...

314
00:31:58,787 --> 00:32:00,755
...to go in there
and take the rebels down.

315
00:32:00,923 --> 00:32:02,515
So you sell the rebels weapons...

316
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:05,353
...the government hires you
when they use them? Nice, sir.

317
00:32:05,828 --> 00:32:08,695
I assume you're asking
for mining concessions, huh?

318
00:32:08,864 --> 00:32:11,992
We save the government,
they show their gratitude.

319
00:32:12,168 --> 00:32:14,466
And you get rich, right?

320
00:32:18,774 --> 00:32:20,332
How long have I known you, Danny?

321
00:32:20,776 --> 00:32:23,939
I was... I was 19, sir.

322
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:28,708
And you survived.
A lot of boys didn't. Why is that?

323
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:32,781
Just lucky, I guess.

324
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:39,559
No, you were a good soldier.
But I made you better, didn't I?

325
00:32:42,932 --> 00:32:44,365
Yes, sir. Yes, you did.

326
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:47,559
And over the years,
didn't I protect you...

327
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:51,929
...teach you about diamonds,
cut you in on the deals?

328
00:32:52,107 --> 00:32:55,770
- Some might call it that, yeah.
- But not you...

329
00:32:56,745 --> 00:33:00,408
...because you done with me now, eh?
On to bigger things.

330
00:33:03,552 --> 00:33:06,020
I need a man that knows
his way around up there.

331
00:33:06,188 --> 00:33:09,954
Unless, of course,
you wanna cut me in. Something pink?

332
00:33:11,026 --> 00:33:12,550
Sir...

333
00:33:12,728 --> 00:33:14,855
Our deal went bad,
and you owe me money.

334
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,759
I'll take a stone as payment.

335
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:20,800
Look, do you think if I found a stone
like that, I'd still be on this continent?

336
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,804
- Come on.
- Danny, give me your hand.

337
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:31,541
That's red earth. It's in our skin.

338
00:33:32,014 --> 00:33:34,414
The Shona say the color
comes from all the blood...

339
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:37,143
...that's being spilled
fighting over the land.

340
00:33:39,188 --> 00:33:43,750
This is home.
You'll never leave Africa.

341
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:49,190
If you say so, sir.

342
00:34:04,713 --> 00:34:08,342
So, what did you do, bury it?

343
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:13,112
Yeah. Yeah, I would have
buried it, huh?

344
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:17,316
<i>- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about? Come on, bru.</i>

345
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:18,926
I'm late for work.

346
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:21,619
Pink, huh? The biggest one
he'd ever seen.

347
00:34:21,797 --> 00:34:23,924
<i>You were in the mining camps,
weren't you, bru?</i>

348
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:27,591
Why else would that rebel with
the bandaged arm make up such a story?

349
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:30,000
Go ask him.

350
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,548
Thank you.

351
00:34:55,197 --> 00:34:57,995
Your mothers and fathers,
your brothers and sisters are dead.

352
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:00,032
- You are dead! You have been reborn.
- No!

353
00:35:00,202 --> 00:35:03,433
- We are your family now.
- No! No!

354
00:35:11,313 --> 00:35:13,645
Your parents are weak.

355
00:35:14,216 --> 00:35:18,653
They're the farmers.
They're the fishermen.

356
00:35:19,154 --> 00:35:22,715
They've done nothing
but suck the blood from this country.

357
00:35:24,093 --> 00:35:28,553
But you are the heroes
who will save this nation.

358
00:35:28,831 --> 00:35:30,799
You are not children anymore.

359
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,734
You're men.

360
00:35:35,938 --> 00:35:39,101
No one has ever given you respect...

361
00:35:39,274 --> 00:35:42,368
...but with this in your hand,
they go fear you.

362
00:35:42,544 --> 00:35:45,035
If you do not get
the respect you deserve...

363
00:35:45,214 --> 00:35:47,512
...you will take it
by shedding their blood.

364
00:35:47,683 --> 00:35:51,642
- Repeat after me, shed their blood.
- Shed their blood.

365
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,880
- Louder! Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Shed their blood!

366
00:35:55,057 --> 00:35:58,185
Make them hear you in Freetown.
Shed their blood! Shed their blood!

367
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,920
<i>Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!</i>

368
00:36:01,096 --> 00:36:03,997
<i>- Dia Vandy, stand up.
- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!</i>

369
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:07,067
<i>- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Put your hand on the gun.</i>

370
00:36:07,236 --> 00:36:08,828
<i>Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!</i>

371
00:36:09,004 --> 00:36:10,596
<i>Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!</i>

372
00:36:10,773 --> 00:36:13,799
<i>- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Now squeeze the trigger.</i>

373
00:36:14,343 --> 00:36:18,746
Come on, Dia. Pull the trigger.
Pull the trigger!

374
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:57,443
I know, I know.
It's hard to be a man.

375
00:36:58,187 --> 00:37:00,712
Sit up. Come.

376
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:05,189
But you are a soldier
of the revolution now.

377
00:37:05,394 --> 00:37:08,261
And I am your commander.

378
00:37:08,764 --> 00:37:10,629
Whatever you need...

379
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:14,030
...guns, CDs, food...

380
00:37:14,203 --> 00:37:17,866
...come to me.
I will take care of you.

381
00:37:21,176 --> 00:37:27,581
Today, you are promoted
to the rank of captain.

382
00:37:32,187 --> 00:37:34,178
Dia Vandy...

383
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,622
...boss man.

384
00:37:55,377 --> 00:37:57,004
<i>How's it, bru?</i>

385
00:37:57,546 --> 00:38:00,709
- You got something for me, huh?
- Yeah.

386
00:38:01,483 --> 00:38:04,884
- So, what's new, M'Ed?
- Fucking RUF.

387
00:38:05,053 --> 00:38:07,578
Tried to hit the government building
across the street.

388
00:38:07,756 --> 00:38:12,420
Shit, man, half the people
be soldiers today, RUF tomorrow.

389
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:15,995
- Might be time to get your family out, huh?
- And go where?

390
00:38:16,164 --> 00:38:19,895
Just fire up the chopper
and fly away like you people?

391
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:22,100
This my country, man.

392
00:38:22,271 --> 00:38:25,729
We here long before you came,
long after you gone.

393
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,913
- Hi. I'm Maddy Bowen.
- How about you dance with me?

394
00:38:38,086 --> 00:38:41,453
- No, I don't dance.
- Neither do I. Come on.

395
00:38:46,662 --> 00:38:49,062
- So, Danny...
- Archer.

396
00:38:49,364 --> 00:38:50,422
Archer.

397
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:54,994
When did you first start
moving stones? Was it Angola?

398
00:38:56,772 --> 00:39:01,368
Then you did the whole
mercenary thing. Was that fun?

399
00:39:02,911 --> 00:39:06,574
So, what are you?
Nihilist? Opportunist?

400
00:39:06,782 --> 00:39:08,909
Maybe I wasn't breast-fed
as a child, huh?

401
00:39:11,053 --> 00:39:13,487
You think I haven't met
people like you before?

402
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:17,022
- I think you get off on people like me.
- You think?

403
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:22,286
When did you first start
working for Van De Kaap?

404
00:39:22,864 --> 00:39:24,491
Christ, you never stop, do you?

405
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:29,134
No, I never stop.

406
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:31,430
Do you want me to stop?

407
00:39:32,808 --> 00:39:36,710
Why don't we go back to your place,
see what's in the minibar, huh?

408
00:39:36,878 --> 00:39:38,971
I'm a print journalist. I drank it.

409
00:39:40,248 --> 00:39:42,978
Is it possible that you don't care
how many people die...

410
00:39:43,151 --> 00:39:45,051
...because of the deals you do?

411
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,451
People here kill each other as a way of life.
Always been like that.

412
00:39:48,724 --> 00:39:51,557
So you can just watch it
and go about your day?

413
00:39:52,861 --> 00:39:54,954
Maybe we should all just
write about it, then.

414
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,462
Look, thanks for the dance, huh?

415
00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:03,035
- And a shot too, huh, M'Ed?
- Sure.

416
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,172
You're a hard case, huh?

417
00:40:08,343 --> 00:40:11,335
Tell me something,
how long you been here in Africa, huh?

418
00:40:11,546 --> 00:40:14,845
Three months. And before that,
Afghanistan and Bosnia.

419
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,243
You come here
with your laptop computer...

420
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:21,355
...and your malaria medicine
and your little bottles of hand sanitizer.

421
00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:25,150
Think you're gonna change
the outcome, huh?

422
00:40:25,327 --> 00:40:27,921
Let me tell you something.
You sell blood diamonds too.

423
00:40:28,096 --> 00:40:29,586
- Really?
- Yeah.

424
00:40:29,765 --> 00:40:30,754
Tell me, how is that?

425
00:40:30,932 --> 00:40:33,196
Who do you think buys
the stones that I bring out?

426
00:40:33,368 --> 00:40:36,997
Dreamy American girls who all want
a storybook wedding and a big, shiny rock...

427
00:40:37,172 --> 00:40:40,733
...like the ones in the advertisements
of your politically-correct magazines.

428
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:43,901
So, please, don't come here
and make judgments on me, all right?

429
00:40:45,313 --> 00:40:49,613
I provide a service. The world wants what
we have, and they want it cheap.

430
00:40:49,785 --> 00:40:53,016
We're in business together.
Get over yourself, darling.

431
00:40:53,488 --> 00:40:57,584
Okay, just to clarify, not all American girls
want a storybook wedding...

432
00:40:57,759 --> 00:41:00,660
...just like not all Africans kill each other
as a way of life.

433
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:03,229
And yeah, it's a shit, shit world,
but you know what?

434
00:41:03,398 --> 00:41:07,266
Good things are done every day,
just, apparently, not by you.

435
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,896
This place is about to explode.

436
00:41:12,174 --> 00:41:14,199
I wanna spend my time
with someone else.

437
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:28,313
<i>You are listening to BBC World Service.</i>

438
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:32,221
<i>In Sierra Leone, Revolutionary United Front
forces have been sighted...</i>

439
00:41:32,394 --> 00:41:35,124
<i>...within 10 kilometers
of the capital city of Freetown.</i>

440
00:41:35,297 --> 00:41:37,959
<i>The minister of the interior
has expressed confidence...</i>

441
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:40,499
<i>...that the government troops
can repel the attack.</i>

442
00:41:40,669 --> 00:41:43,934
<i>All foreign nationals are being advised
to leave the country.</i>

443
00:41:44,106 --> 00:41:46,267
<i>There are also unconfirmed reports...</i>

444
00:41:46,441 --> 00:41:50,502
<i>...that atrocities are being committed by
both sides in the rapidly worsening situation.</i>

445
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:54,615
<i>The United Nations has described
the refugee situation as critical.</i>

446
00:42:06,194 --> 00:42:08,594
Don't tell me you're gonna try
and sell it yourself.

447
00:42:08,764 --> 00:42:11,289
To who?
And for what price, my friend?

448
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:13,491
You need my help,
whether you like it or not.

449
00:42:13,668 --> 00:42:16,728
- What are you talking about?
- Here, let me help you with that.

450
00:42:16,905 --> 00:42:20,773
You hear that? You hear that?
They came into the city overnight.

451
00:42:20,942 --> 00:42:23,240
It's started.
What are you gonna do now, huh?

452
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:27,711
Listen, the right stone can buy anything.
Information, safety, even freedom.

453
00:42:27,883 --> 00:42:30,317
But a big stone does not stay secret
for very long.

454
00:42:30,485 --> 00:42:33,750
The moment you tell anyone about it,
your life is absolutely worthless.

455
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:37,050
The only reason you're alive is
you haven't told anyone where it is.

456
00:42:37,225 --> 00:42:38,487
Am I right? Am I?

457
00:42:38,894 --> 00:42:40,919
Who do you think got you
out of jail, huh?

458
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:44,156
- That makes us partners.
- I am not your partner!

459
00:42:44,332 --> 00:42:46,823
What if I helped you find your family?

460
00:42:47,002 --> 00:42:48,526
What do you know of my family?

461
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,729
The relief agencies are useless,
the hospitals are overwhelmed.

462
00:42:51,907 --> 00:42:54,501
<i>- There are other ways, bru.
- Liar.</i>

463
00:42:54,676 --> 00:42:57,907
Look at me. I know people, huh?
White people.

464
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,207
Without me, you're just another
black man in Africa, all right?

465
00:43:04,586 --> 00:43:06,315
Oh, shit.

466
00:43:08,056 --> 00:43:09,648
We got no time.
What's it gonna be?

467
00:43:09,825 --> 00:43:11,816
You would say anything.
How can I trust you?

468
00:43:11,993 --> 00:43:15,394
I don't give a fuck about you, all right?
That diamond could be priceless!

469
00:43:15,564 --> 00:43:19,830
We split it, and you get your family.
What's it gonna be, yes or no? Yes or no?

470
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:22,595
- Where will we go? Where do we go?
- Come on, follow me!

471
00:43:54,035 --> 00:43:55,662
Stay low!

472
00:43:57,539 --> 00:43:58,767
Get your ass over here!

473
00:44:09,818 --> 00:44:10,876
Wait!

474
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:12,980
Now!

475
00:44:18,126 --> 00:44:19,684
Come on, come on.

476
00:44:23,732 --> 00:44:25,097
Come on!

477
00:44:41,316 --> 00:44:42,908
Come on.

478
00:44:43,084 --> 00:44:44,278
Fuck!

479
00:44:53,561 --> 00:44:55,392
No, this way.

480
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:57,320
Fire!

481
00:45:13,548 --> 00:45:14,981
Fuck! Go, go, go!

482
00:45:15,283 --> 00:45:16,875
Go!

483
00:45:26,895 --> 00:45:28,692
Shit!

484
00:45:28,863 --> 00:45:30,524
No! No!

485
00:45:39,007 --> 00:45:40,736
This way.

486
00:46:00,595 --> 00:46:02,756
This way. Stay low.

487
00:46:14,175 --> 00:46:15,938
Come on. Go, go, go. Come on.

488
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:24,680
Come on!

489
00:46:30,058 --> 00:46:32,583
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

490
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,412
Fire!

491
00:48:42,257 --> 00:48:46,023
- Is there another way?
- That bridge is the only way across, huh?

492
00:48:46,194 --> 00:48:48,355
So, what do we do?

493
00:48:59,174 --> 00:49:03,941
- You are RUF, huh? And I am your prisoner.
- What do you mean?

494
00:49:04,112 --> 00:49:07,172
You wanna see your son again, don't you?
You stay behind me.

495
00:49:07,882 --> 00:49:09,509
Wait, wait. Wait.

496
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,216
Bring that pink chicken skin
over here, huh?

497
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,790
Now let me shoot that pink ass, boy.

498
00:49:53,494 --> 00:49:55,428
Where are we going?

499
00:49:56,197 --> 00:49:58,757
Lungi's under government control.

500
00:49:58,933 --> 00:50:03,393
I'm gonna try to locate a sat phone
to get in contact with my pilot, all right?

501
00:50:03,571 --> 00:50:05,937
I have agreed to nothing.

502
00:50:06,808 --> 00:50:09,299
You're in a bit of a conundrum there,
my friend.

503
00:50:09,477 --> 00:50:13,743
You know what that means?
It means you have no choice.

504
00:50:27,629 --> 00:50:30,792
So you're a fisherman, huh?

505
00:50:30,965 --> 00:50:34,799
- What do you catch mostly?
- Fish.

506
00:50:43,177 --> 00:50:44,610
Come on.

507
00:50:56,824 --> 00:50:58,348
- Hello.
- Back away from the fence.

508
00:50:58,526 --> 00:51:01,120
<i>Listen, I'm from
the Cape Herald, all right?</i>

509
00:51:01,296 --> 00:51:04,231
My wallet, my credentials,
everything got left in Freetown.

510
00:51:04,399 --> 00:51:07,061
We barely got out with our lives.
Can we just get through?

511
00:51:07,235 --> 00:51:10,261
Back away from the fence.

512
00:51:14,242 --> 00:51:15,903
But you are not a journalist.

513
00:51:16,077 --> 00:51:17,510
I'm trying to get us to Kono.

514
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:20,079
- Do you understand that, huh?
- Getting B-roll. Wait.

515
00:51:20,248 --> 00:51:22,808
Listen, I'm coming back.
I'm coming back just now.

516
00:51:22,984 --> 00:51:26,044
<i>How's it, my bru?
Have you got an extra smoke?</i>

517
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,949
- Here.
- Oh, cheers.

518
00:51:28,122 --> 00:51:31,148
I'm looking for someone, an American
by the name of Maddy Bowen.

519
00:51:31,326 --> 00:51:34,090
- If you saw her, you would not forget it.
- Yeah, I know her.

520
00:51:34,262 --> 00:51:35,251
- Is it?
- Yeah.

521
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:39,025
Can you tell her Danny Archer's looking
for her? I've got the story she wants.

522
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,397
Okay, but I'm going out for a bit.
If I see her before, I'll tell her.

523
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,800
Magic. Listen, we'll be
right down the road, huh?

524
00:51:44,972 --> 00:51:47,839
<i>- Sweet. Cheers, bru.
- Cheers.</i>

525
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:52,646
It is as I said.
You will say anything.

526
00:51:59,153 --> 00:52:00,814
- You don't mind waiting?
- No worries.

527
00:52:00,988 --> 00:52:04,856
- Thank you so much. I'll just be a sec.
- All right, Maddy.

528
00:52:08,229 --> 00:52:09,628
Hi.

529
00:52:09,797 --> 00:52:11,560
You got out.

530
00:52:11,733 --> 00:52:14,793
Yes. Hello again.

531
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:17,301
- This is Solomon Vandy.
- Hi.

532
00:52:17,472 --> 00:52:18,996
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

533
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,741
So I'm on deadline. I've been waiting
four hours to use the phone.

534
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:27,210
- I've got someone holding my place in line.
- I understand. Come with me, huh?

535
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:29,942
All right. Here it is.

536
00:52:30,118 --> 00:52:33,053
- There's a company called Tiara Diamonds.
- Right?

537
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:35,519
They get the stones
that I smuggle into Liberia.

538
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:38,056
Now, Van De Kaap
has no visible ties to Tiara...

539
00:52:38,226 --> 00:52:41,525
...but through a series of cross holdings
and offshore bank accounts...

540
00:52:41,696 --> 00:52:43,823
- ...they actually own it.
- You can prove this?

541
00:52:45,233 --> 00:52:48,691
- If you help me out, yeah.
- Right, here it comes.

542
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,395
Before you say anything,
look at that man. You see him?

543
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:56,435
His entire village was burned down.
His wife and children, they got away.

544
00:52:56,611 --> 00:52:59,808
He's been working in the mining camps,
trying to get his family back.

545
00:52:59,981 --> 00:53:01,573
He cannot get through the red tape.

546
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:04,513
All I'm asking is this,
that you help him, huh?

547
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:06,710
And how do you know this man?

548
00:53:07,355 --> 00:53:11,189
- I know him. I know him.
- Oh, come on, Archer.

549
00:53:11,626 --> 00:53:13,184
You're using him.

550
00:53:14,762 --> 00:53:19,028
I'm using him, and you are using me,
and this is how it works, isn't it?

551
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,964
Come on. Look, you've got access
to U.N. databases.

552
00:53:22,136 --> 00:53:24,036
- You can track his family for him.
- Why?

553
00:53:24,205 --> 00:53:27,368
This whole country's at war.
Why should I help just one person?

554
00:53:33,014 --> 00:53:34,982
I can't believe I just said that.

555
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:40,847
My family's here, in Guinea?

556
00:53:41,022 --> 00:53:43,320
Yes, according to the manifest.

557
00:53:44,258 --> 00:53:46,021
I do not know how to thank you.

558
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:14,715
Thank you. Thank you.

559
00:54:29,136 --> 00:54:31,400
This is what a million people looks like.

560
00:54:34,842 --> 00:54:38,676
At the moment, the second largest
refugee camp in Africa.

561
00:54:39,247 --> 00:54:44,947
Might catch a minute of this on CNN,
somewhere between Sports and Weather.

562
00:54:54,428 --> 00:54:55,759
- Hello.
- Yeah, hello?

563
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:58,296
I've spoken with Colonel Coedoo...

564
00:54:58,733 --> 00:55:01,600
...and highlighted the names
we're looking for.

565
00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:02,963
- Move away.
- What him doing?

566
00:55:03,137 --> 00:55:04,502
Okay, I'm gonna check for you.

567
00:55:04,672 --> 00:55:07,197
- Wait me there.
- Okay, thank you.

568
00:55:07,542 --> 00:55:08,634
We are here to help you.

569
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:11,073
This woman says she has
spoken to Coedoo.

570
00:55:11,245 --> 00:55:15,011
An entire country made homeless.

571
00:55:17,919 --> 00:55:21,286
Two multiplied by three
is equal to six.

572
00:55:21,455 --> 00:55:24,982
Two multiplied by four
is equal to eight.

573
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:28,390
Two multiplied by five
is equal to 10.

574
00:55:28,563 --> 00:55:31,657
Two multiplied by six
is equal to 12.

575
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:10,898
Jassie.

576
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:13,529
Jassie!

577
00:56:14,275 --> 00:56:16,004
Jassie!

578
00:56:16,177 --> 00:56:17,337
- Jassie.
- Solo.

579
00:56:17,511 --> 00:56:18,739
- Jassie.
- Solo.

580
00:56:18,946 --> 00:56:21,278
Jassie. Jassie.

581
00:56:23,384 --> 00:56:25,147
- Solomon.
- Jassie.

582
00:56:33,928 --> 00:56:35,156
- Solomon.
- Jassie.

583
00:56:36,897 --> 00:56:38,694
Dia. Dia.

584
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:40,929
Where is Dia?

585
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:45,865
Jassie!

586
00:56:56,584 --> 00:56:58,814
They took him.

587
00:57:03,224 --> 00:57:05,215
There are only two children
on the manifest.

588
00:57:05,393 --> 00:57:07,918
- Where is my son?
- Oh, Christ.

589
00:57:08,195 --> 00:57:10,060
Where is my son?

590
00:57:10,231 --> 00:57:11,994
- Away from the fence.
- Where is my son?

591
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:13,428
Move away from the fence.

592
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:16,661
- Let them out! Let them out!
- Keep away from the fence.

593
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:19,266
Let them out!

594
00:57:22,777 --> 00:57:23,766
Away from the fence.

595
00:57:25,746 --> 00:57:27,543
- They'll shoot you!
- Jassie!

596
00:57:27,715 --> 00:57:30,081
No! Solo!

597
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:32,549
Do you want your wife and child
to watch you die?

598
00:57:33,254 --> 00:57:36,052
Solo! Solo!

599
00:57:45,499 --> 00:57:50,061
They said they're concerned that
some of the refugees might be rebels...

600
00:57:50,604 --> 00:57:54,335
...so they refused to release them
until there's a cease-fire.

601
00:57:55,743 --> 00:57:58,507
I'm so sorry, Solomon.

602
00:57:58,879 --> 00:58:01,541
What you want, Mr. Archer,
is beyond those hills...

603
00:58:01,716 --> 00:58:03,877
...where I buried it.

604
00:58:27,141 --> 00:58:32,044
You say the mine is on the Sewa River.
Where exactly?

605
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,704
Solomon.

606
00:58:35,716 --> 00:58:37,581
I do not need a map.

607
00:58:37,752 --> 00:58:42,155
Yeah, well, I do.
Look, we are down here, huh?

608
00:58:42,323 --> 00:58:44,086
The press convoy
is on its way to Kono.

609
00:58:44,258 --> 00:58:47,557
You say the diamond mine is up here.
Where did you bury it?

610
00:58:50,898 --> 00:58:54,095
When we get to Kono,
we're gonna have to walk, all right?

611
00:58:54,268 --> 00:58:57,032
You damn well better be able to find it.

612
00:58:58,973 --> 00:59:03,205
My son is a very good student.

613
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:07,006
He walks five kilometers
to the Sister School...

614
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:10,548
...every morning to study English.

615
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:15,446
He's going to be a doctor one day.

616
00:59:39,747 --> 00:59:43,649
"In the 90-degree heat,
Solomon Vandy drops to his knees...

617
00:59:43,818 --> 00:59:47,481
...rattling the wire
with his powerful hands."

618
00:59:51,025 --> 00:59:53,789
- What?
- Nothing.

619
00:59:55,896 --> 00:59:57,921
Do you think I'm exploiting his grief?

620
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,663
You're right. It's shit.

621
01:00:02,436 --> 01:00:05,166
It's like one of those infomercials.

622
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:10,174
You know, the little black babies
with swollen bellies and flies in their eyes.

623
01:00:10,344 --> 01:00:14,246
So here I've got dead mothers,
I've got severed limbs, but it's nothing new.

624
01:00:14,415 --> 01:00:17,009
It might be enough
to make people cry if they read it...

625
01:00:17,184 --> 01:00:18,651
...maybe even write a check...

626
01:00:18,819 --> 01:00:21,185
...but it's not gonna be enough
to make it stop.

627
01:00:21,488 --> 01:00:26,050
I am sick of writing about victims,
but it's all I can fucking do.

628
01:00:26,227 --> 01:00:27,751
Because I need facts.

629
01:00:27,928 --> 01:00:32,456
I need names. I need dates.
I need pictures. I need bank accounts.

630
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:37,026
People back home
wouldn't buy a ring...

631
01:00:37,204 --> 01:00:39,468
...if they knew it cost
someone else their hand.

632
01:00:40,107 --> 01:00:42,268
But I can't write that story...

633
01:00:42,443 --> 01:00:45,970
...until I get facts
that can be verified...

634
01:00:46,146 --> 01:00:51,277
...which is to say, until I find someone
who will go on record.

635
01:00:52,453 --> 01:00:53,977
So if that is not you...

636
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:58,250
...and you're not really gonna help me,
and we're not really gonna screw...

637
01:00:58,425 --> 01:01:01,656
...then why don't you get the fuck
out of my face...

638
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:03,729
...and let me do my work?

639
01:01:11,872 --> 01:01:15,808
Do you know that Solomon thinks
his son's gonna be a doctor one day?

640
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:21,742
Maybe his baby dies in that camp.
Maybe his daughter gets raped.

641
01:01:22,082 --> 01:01:24,243
Who knows, maybe both.

642
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,083
Do you realize that
that diamond...

643
01:01:28,255 --> 01:01:31,019
...is the only chance he has
of getting his family out?

644
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:35,423
- You don't give a rat's ass about his family.
- Do you understand that?

645
01:01:40,901 --> 01:01:42,960
Listen, I need to get to Kono, all right?

646
01:01:43,137 --> 01:01:45,230
The only way
is with the press convoy.

647
01:01:45,406 --> 01:01:47,772
I'm a journalist,
and he's my cameraman, all right?

648
01:01:47,942 --> 01:01:49,466
- No.
- Please, Maddy.

649
01:01:49,643 --> 01:01:51,270
- Please.
- No!

650
01:02:04,591 --> 01:02:06,957
After I smuggle the stones
across the border...

651
01:02:08,128 --> 01:02:10,858
...local buyers get them
to a middleman in Monrovia.

652
01:02:14,702 --> 01:02:15,999
Go on.

653
01:02:17,504 --> 01:02:22,373
<i>He pays off Customs and then certifies
that the diamonds were mined in Liberia.</i>

654
01:02:22,543 --> 01:02:24,909
That way, they can be legally exported.

655
01:02:25,479 --> 01:02:28,573
Now, once they've reached
the buyers in Antwerp...

656
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:31,240
<i>...diamonds are brought
to the sorting tables...</i>

657
01:02:31,418 --> 01:02:33,010
<i>...no more questions are asked.</i>

658
01:02:34,188 --> 01:02:35,951
By the time they get to India...

659
01:02:36,123 --> 01:02:39,854
<i>...the dirty stones are mixed with
the clean stones from all over the world...</i>

660
01:02:40,027 --> 01:02:42,291
...and then they become
like any other diamonds.

661
01:02:42,463 --> 01:02:44,658
And Van De Kaap
knows about all this?

662
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:47,324
Yeah.

663
01:02:47,501 --> 01:02:50,163
<i>When I get to London,
I meet with Simmons.</i>

664
01:02:50,604 --> 01:02:54,040
Supply and demand. You control the supply,
and you keep the demand high.

665
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:55,675
- Agreed.
- Good.

666
01:02:55,843 --> 01:02:58,209
Now, there's an underground vault...

667
01:02:58,379 --> 01:03:01,940
<i>...where they put all the stones
they buy up to keep off the market...</i>

668
01:03:02,116 --> 01:03:03,947
<i>...so they can keep the price high.</i>

669
01:03:04,718 --> 01:03:08,119
If rebels wanna flood the market
with a billion dollars' worth of rough...

670
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:11,348
...a company like Van De Kaap,
who says that they're rare...

671
01:03:11,525 --> 01:03:13,186
...can't afford to let that happen.

672
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,624
<i>Especially when they're telling
some poor sod...</i>

673
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:18,287
<i>...he's supposed to shell out
three months' salary...</i>

674
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:19,796
<i>...for an engagement ring.</i>

675
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:22,959
Now, technically speaking,
they're not financing the war...

676
01:03:23,137 --> 01:03:25,970
...but creating a situation
where it pays to keep it going.

677
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:29,371
- You understand?
- Yes. And where's my proof?

678
01:03:35,849 --> 01:03:39,979
Names, dates and numbered accounts.

679
01:03:42,089 --> 01:03:45,149
You publish one word of this story
before I give them the stone...

680
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:47,350
...and I'm dead, huh?

681
01:03:47,528 --> 01:03:51,897
After I give it to them,
then... I leave this continent forever.

682
01:03:54,134 --> 01:03:55,931
If you don't come out
with the diamond?

683
01:03:56,103 --> 01:03:58,503
Then write whatever you want.

684
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:01,432
I'm already dead.

685
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:11,945
Now, remember. All you say is,
"I am the cameraman," all right?

686
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:14,053
Listen, I cannot do this.

687
01:04:14,221 --> 01:04:16,849
- Why not?
- Because I am not a journalist.

688
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:19,515
- Of course you're not.
- Well, then how can I say I am?

689
01:04:19,693 --> 01:04:22,890
Because you do. Because that's how
you get your son back, all right?

690
01:04:23,063 --> 01:04:25,463
Now get on the bus. Go.

691
01:04:42,149 --> 01:04:45,050
I am the cameraman.

692
01:04:50,991 --> 01:04:53,152
You are writing about
what is happening here?

693
01:04:53,961 --> 01:04:54,950
Yes.

694
01:04:55,129 --> 01:04:59,327
So when people in your country read it,
they will come help us, yes?

695
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:01,125
Probably not.

696
01:05:02,736 --> 01:05:05,102
- You heard of a Stinger?
- What?

697
01:05:05,272 --> 01:05:09,732
<i>Your friend, Maddy. She's like a full-on,
heat-seeking missile, bru.</i>

698
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:12,606
I mean, I saw her go into Afghanistan...

699
01:05:12,779 --> 01:05:15,907
...like about 200 clicks
into Taliban land.

700
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:18,916
<i>When the military said no,
she just took a bus, bru.</i>

701
01:05:19,086 --> 01:05:22,385
Came back with 3000 words,
and she still looked so good.

702
01:05:22,556 --> 01:05:24,421
- Like hot, you know?
- All right.

703
01:05:24,591 --> 01:05:26,320
Calm down to the frantic now, huh?

704
01:05:27,928 --> 01:05:29,759
- What's that?
- What's going on?

705
01:05:30,898 --> 01:05:32,126
Looks like it was an RPG.

706
01:05:32,299 --> 01:05:34,130
Open the door. Let us out.

707
01:05:34,468 --> 01:05:36,402
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on. Go, go, go.

708
01:05:38,372 --> 01:05:39,839
Go, go! Move, move, move!

709
01:05:40,641 --> 01:05:43,542
We've just happened upon
the sight of an ambush...

710
01:05:44,678 --> 01:05:47,010
...fifteen kilometers
from the Liberian border...

711
01:05:47,181 --> 01:05:49,809
- ...near the Moa River...
- As you can see behind me...

712
01:05:49,983 --> 01:05:51,507
...just a few minutes ago...

713
01:05:51,685 --> 01:05:54,017
- ...an ambulance has...
- Got movement in the bush.

714
01:05:54,221 --> 01:05:56,246
- Check out the head of the road.
- Spread out.

715
01:05:56,423 --> 01:05:58,152
--at this site.
Dozens of--

716
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:01,093
Many are injured.

717
01:06:11,238 --> 01:06:14,401
Get back on the bus, huh?
Get back on! Come on!

718
01:06:14,575 --> 01:06:16,202
- Maddy!
- Move it! Move it!

719
01:06:16,376 --> 01:06:17,365
Get back on the bus!

720
01:06:17,544 --> 01:06:19,102
Solomon! Solomon!

721
01:06:19,279 --> 01:06:20,769
- Let's go.
- Solomon, come here!

722
01:06:20,948 --> 01:06:22,381
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, come on.

723
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:25,245
- Get in the bus!
- Move, move, move! Come on, come on.

724
01:06:25,586 --> 01:06:27,417
- Move!
- Get in the bus. Let's go.

725
01:06:27,588 --> 01:06:29,783
Get in, get in.
Goddamn it, get in! Get in!

726
01:06:29,957 --> 01:06:32,391
- Let me inside!
- There's no fucking space!

727
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,823
- Let them on the bus.
- You give him your seat.

728
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:37,964
What if we just take your place, huh?
What if we take your place?

729
01:06:38,131 --> 01:06:41,066
That's enough. He can ride with me.
Oi, he can ride with me.

730
01:06:41,235 --> 01:06:43,795
Maddy! Let's go!
Maddy, let's go. Come on!

731
01:06:56,717 --> 01:06:59,845
Nothing like a little bang-bang
to get the heart started, Maddy.

732
01:07:00,721 --> 01:07:03,918
- Whatever you say, Corbauld.
- Come on, love. Don't be like that.

733
01:07:04,091 --> 01:07:07,549
Story's played out, hasn't it?
Government bad, rebels worse.

734
01:07:08,095 --> 01:07:10,529
No one gives a toss anymore.
Know what I mean?

735
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,234
<i>This medicine will make you strong...</i>

736
01:07:48,769 --> 01:07:51,169
...make you invisible to your enemies.

737
01:07:51,338 --> 01:07:53,568
Bullets will bounce off you.

738
01:08:04,384 --> 01:08:08,150
Superboy Killer, yes, huh?
Commando.

739
01:08:09,323 --> 01:08:11,257
Foreigners are the cause of the problems.

740
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:17,694
Poppy Sankoh say,
"Overthrow those who would exploit you."

741
01:08:19,566 --> 01:08:21,056
I am Baby Killer.

742
01:08:24,838 --> 01:08:28,501
- I am the Master of Disaster.
- You will be strong.

743
01:08:31,845 --> 01:08:33,278
I am Born Trouble.

744
01:08:39,686 --> 01:08:41,745
I am See Me No More.

745
01:08:51,298 --> 01:08:54,233
You'd think they'd want
at least one decent road in this place.

746
01:08:55,669 --> 01:08:59,799
I'm gonna have to start charging
an entrance fee. Oh, God!

747
01:09:30,619 --> 01:09:31,847
Get down!

748
01:09:39,962 --> 01:09:42,192
- Look out!
- Shit!

749
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:56,268
- You all right?
- Fine.

750
01:10:01,917 --> 01:10:03,214
Shit!

751
01:10:06,322 --> 01:10:07,653
Hold on!

752
01:10:17,767 --> 01:10:19,166
Hold on!

753
01:10:30,446 --> 01:10:31,674
Come on.

754
01:10:39,188 --> 01:10:41,383
- Everyone all right, huh?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

755
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:43,023
Let me see that. You okay?

756
01:10:43,192 --> 01:10:44,250
- Yeah.
- All right.

757
01:10:46,896 --> 01:10:49,888
Quietly, now. Quietly.

758
01:11:11,053 --> 01:11:12,486
Come on.

759
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:37,945
Kamajors. Local militia
protecting their homes, huh?

760
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:39,984
- Do not look them in the eye.
- No.

761
01:11:54,469 --> 01:11:55,959
Excuse me. Excuse me?

762
01:11:56,904 --> 01:12:00,271
<i>Hi, I'm Maddy Bowen
with Vital Affairs magazine.</i>

763
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:03,501
Wonder if I could take your picture.
I'm just gonna get my camera.

764
01:12:03,678 --> 01:12:06,613
I've heard about your struggle.
I'd love to know more about it.

765
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:09,409
Would you mind if I took your picture?
Everyone together?

766
01:12:09,751 --> 01:12:11,514
Everyone could all come in together.

767
01:12:15,023 --> 01:12:17,048
Is that okay?
If everyone could come closer.

768
01:12:18,092 --> 01:12:21,186
If you come over here and come in
nice and close. That's good.

769
01:12:21,362 --> 01:12:24,820
Yeah. That's great.
And we'll get one with all of us.

770
01:12:25,099 --> 01:12:26,896
There you go. That's perfect.

771
01:12:28,703 --> 01:12:31,228
How about one together?
Us together, what do you think?

772
01:12:31,406 --> 01:12:33,374
I'll come in like this, yeah?

773
01:12:34,175 --> 01:12:35,164
Cheese.

774
01:12:37,345 --> 01:12:39,677
So do you think
they've read your work?

775
01:12:39,847 --> 01:12:41,974
Shut up.

776
01:12:54,862 --> 01:12:57,194
Hey, get them, get them, get them.

777
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:02,530
- I got a score. I got a score.
- You missed.

778
01:13:03,237 --> 01:13:05,398
Where have you come from?

779
01:13:05,973 --> 01:13:08,703
- Where did you come from?
- Where have you come from?

780
01:13:09,811 --> 01:13:12,644
That's right. Yeah.
From New York. From America.

781
01:13:12,814 --> 01:13:14,714
I don't have anything for you.

782
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:36,833
My name is Benjamin Margai.

783
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,597
Danny Archer. This is Maddy Bowen.

784
01:13:39,774 --> 01:13:42,834
- Hello. How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

785
01:13:57,658 --> 01:13:59,956
I'm the cameraman?

786
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:05,498
The Belgians were the first
to chop off limbs in Africa.

787
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:10,035
King Leopold took one hand
for every hundredth slave in the Congo...

788
01:14:10,204 --> 01:14:12,297
...to keep them in line.

789
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:15,875
Many of these children
were taken by the RUF.

790
01:14:16,043 --> 01:14:18,034
We have taken them back.

791
01:14:18,212 --> 01:14:21,306
Some of them have been
made to do horrible things.

792
01:14:21,482 --> 01:14:24,508
We are trying
to bring them back to life.

793
01:14:24,685 --> 01:14:26,312
Let me show you.

794
01:14:28,356 --> 01:14:30,654
Imagine doing all this, huh?

795
01:14:31,959 --> 01:14:33,859
What's your excuse?

796
01:14:34,662 --> 01:14:39,998
Well, it's gotten hard to go back
to sipping lattes and talking interest rates.

797
01:14:40,234 --> 01:14:42,862
So you're an action junkie, huh?

798
01:14:43,805 --> 01:14:46,103
Three out of five ex-boyfriends
recently polled...

799
01:14:46,274 --> 01:14:50,711
...say that I prefer to be
in a constant state of crisis.

800
01:14:51,245 --> 01:14:53,509
Maybe I just give a shit.

801
01:14:57,185 --> 01:14:58,174
You were good today.

802
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:01,952
You know that?

803
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:04,580
You too.

804
01:15:07,528 --> 01:15:10,463
"--that sometimes they forgot
to close the door.

805
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:13,691
She also wrote
about her sister Josie...

806
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:19,296
...who was very ill
and who had to be taken to hospital."

807
01:15:21,342 --> 01:15:22,536
Cheers.

808
01:15:25,346 --> 01:15:27,940
So how many attacks
have there been in the area?

809
01:15:28,115 --> 01:15:31,016
I have known most of the rebels
since they were children.

810
01:15:31,185 --> 01:15:35,713
The local commander is still afraid
I will come after him with my ruler.

811
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:40,616
So you think because your intentions
are good, they'll spare you, huh?

812
01:15:40,795 --> 01:15:43,628
My heart always told me
that people are inherently good.

813
01:15:43,798 --> 01:15:45,993
My experience suggests otherwise.

814
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:47,964
But what about you, Mr. Archer?

815
01:15:48,402 --> 01:15:50,836
In your long career as a journalist...

816
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:53,838
...would you say that people
are mostly good?

817
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:57,343
No.

818
01:15:57,612 --> 01:15:59,136
I'd say they're just people.

819
01:15:59,313 --> 01:16:03,249
Exactly. It is what they do
that makes them good or bad.

820
01:16:03,417 --> 01:16:06,648
A moment of love,
even in a bad man...

821
01:16:06,921 --> 01:16:09,389
...can give meaning to a life.

822
01:16:09,557 --> 01:16:13,186
None of us knows which path
will lead us to God.

823
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:17,420
Hey!

824
01:17:05,413 --> 01:17:07,278
It's palm wine.

825
01:17:16,557 --> 01:17:19,492
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, yeah. It takes getting used to, huh?

826
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:21,150
God.

827
01:17:21,329 --> 01:17:24,059
- Drank that as a boy.
- In Rhodesia?

828
01:17:26,233 --> 01:17:27,461
I take notes.

829
01:17:30,171 --> 01:17:31,900
The Shona...

830
01:17:33,207 --> 01:17:35,505
The Shona have a word for me.

831
01:17:37,345 --> 01:17:40,974
- It means "white boy in Africa."
- When did you leave?

832
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:43,310
I didn't leave.

833
01:17:43,484 --> 01:17:47,818
<i>I got sent away to South Africa
in 1978 when the munts overran us.</i>

834
01:17:48,155 --> 01:17:49,622
Then you joined the army?

835
01:17:52,493 --> 01:17:54,654
Yeah. Yeah, I did my time in Angola.

836
01:17:54,829 --> 01:17:57,525
- The 32 Battalion.
- That's right.

837
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:03,165
You know, contrary to what
you might think about us...

838
01:18:03,337 --> 01:18:06,829
...we fought with the blacks, huh?
Yeah. Side by side.

839
01:18:07,008 --> 01:18:10,739
There was no apartheid in a foxhole.
The colonel always used to tell us that.

840
01:18:10,911 --> 01:18:14,312
- This is Colonel Coetzee?
- Yeah.

841
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:19,951
Then, of course, it's 1994.
No more army.

842
01:18:20,121 --> 01:18:21,952
No more apartheid.

843
01:18:22,123 --> 01:18:25,490
Truth and reconciliation
and all of that rubbish, you know.

844
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,149
Kumbaya.

845
01:18:27,928 --> 01:18:30,692
We fought and died together,
you know?

846
01:18:30,865 --> 01:18:34,130
Black and white. Most people back home
didn't even know we were at war.

847
01:18:34,301 --> 01:18:36,166
We thought we were
fighting Communism...

848
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:40,205
...but in the end, it was all about
who gets what, you know?

849
01:18:40,374 --> 01:18:43,434
Ivory, oil, gold:

850
01:18:44,378 --> 01:18:46,141
Diamonds.

851
01:18:49,383 --> 01:18:52,352
So one day I decided,
"Fuck it," you know?

852
01:18:52,987 --> 01:18:54,545
"I'm gonna get mine."

853
01:18:54,722 --> 01:18:56,314
You gonna steal his diamond?

854
01:19:03,831 --> 01:19:07,528
That diamond is my ticket
out of this godforsaken continent.

855
01:19:07,735 --> 01:19:09,566
That doesn't answer the question.

856
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:24,310
My dad came home
from the war in '69.

857
01:19:26,587 --> 01:19:28,452
And it took him...

858
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:31,683
...about 20 years to get right.

859
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:34,858
What?

860
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:42,031
You Americans love to talk
about your feelings, huh?

861
01:19:42,203 --> 01:19:44,467
So, what does that mean?
What does that mean?

862
01:19:44,638 --> 01:19:46,765
- Got a thing for messed-up vets now?
- Shut up.

863
01:19:48,776 --> 01:19:50,243
You lost both your parents.

864
01:19:51,145 --> 01:19:53,978
That's a polite way
of putting it, yeah.

865
01:19:56,617 --> 01:19:58,949
Mom was raped and shot...

866
01:20:01,789 --> 01:20:04,883
...and Dad was decapitated
and hung from a hook in the barn.

867
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:08,156
I was 9.

868
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,357
Boohoo, right?

869
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,231
Sometimes I wonder...

870
01:20:22,343 --> 01:20:25,403
...will God ever forgive us
for what we've done to each other?

871
01:20:29,049 --> 01:20:31,916
Then I look around and I realize...

872
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:36,278
...God left this place a long time ago.

873
01:20:42,997 --> 01:20:45,022
It's...

874
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:49,235
What's the point, huh?

875
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,705
Oh, shit. Keep moving, huh?

876
01:21:34,882 --> 01:21:36,645
- What?
- Drive at them. They'll panic.

877
01:21:36,817 --> 01:21:39,081
Do you know where the word
"infantry" comes from?

878
01:21:39,253 --> 01:21:42,552
It means "child soldier."
They are just children.

879
01:21:42,723 --> 01:21:46,386
- Stop! Stop! RUF on the road!
- Hi. Hello. Hello.

880
01:21:47,628 --> 01:21:48,686
Hello, little brothers.

881
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:51,387
- RUF on the road!
- Yeah, yeah. What is your names?

882
01:21:51,899 --> 01:21:54,197
I'm Dead Body.
Who is this motherfucker?

883
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:56,029
We are teachers on our way to Kono.

884
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:58,433
Only RUF on the road.

885
01:21:58,606 --> 01:22:00,540
- RUF only!
- Yes, yes, I understand that.

886
01:22:00,741 --> 01:22:02,072
- Only RUF!
- But son, this is--

887
01:22:04,345 --> 01:22:05,937
Don't move! Don't move! Fuck.

888
01:22:08,182 --> 01:22:11,515
Jesus Christ! Maddy, press your hand
against the exit wound there, huh?

889
01:22:11,685 --> 01:22:13,983
- Got it.
- Keep it there, huh?

890
01:22:14,154 --> 01:22:15,917
Whatever you do,
don't talk, all right?

891
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:17,921
Is there any wine left in that jug?

892
01:22:18,092 --> 01:22:19,957
- Here.
- Pour it all over everything, huh?

893
01:22:21,495 --> 01:22:24,430
The colonel's gonna have a medic
at the airstrip in Kono.

894
01:22:24,598 --> 01:22:27,590
- How far is it?
- You said not to talk.

895
01:22:27,868 --> 01:22:29,062
A comedian, huh?

896
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,650
- How's his pulse?
- I can feel it sometimes.

897
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:59,065
- Hold it right there.
- Stop.

898
01:22:59,233 --> 01:23:00,461
Papers, please.

899
01:23:04,638 --> 01:23:05,866
Excuse me.

900
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,975
I was just trying
to keep pressure on the wound.

901
01:23:09,143 --> 01:23:11,668
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- You'll be all right, huh?

902
01:23:12,346 --> 01:23:13,643
Will you?

903
01:23:14,348 --> 01:23:17,340
I'll check on him in the tent
in a little bit. Thank you.

904
01:23:17,584 --> 01:23:18,915
Hey.

905
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:21,444
Look who's alive, eh?

906
01:23:21,622 --> 01:23:22,953
I told the H you'd be back.

907
01:23:24,925 --> 01:23:27,860
I'm afraid we're evacuating
all non-military personnel, miss.

908
01:23:28,028 --> 01:23:29,859
Transport touches down at 1600.

909
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:31,793
She's with me, all right?

910
01:23:31,999 --> 01:23:35,662
No exceptions, pal. This is gonna be ugly.
Colonel doesn't want an audience.

911
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:38,634
Is I.R.'s presence here
known to other African nations?

912
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,165
- She's with you?
- Yeah.

913
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:45,175
Come on. The colonel's this way.

914
01:23:45,346 --> 01:23:47,177
Give me a minute, huh?

915
01:23:50,351 --> 01:23:52,876
We block their escape
by blowing the bridge.

916
01:23:54,521 --> 01:23:56,216
That's correct.

917
01:23:56,957 --> 01:23:59,255
You made it out. Well done.

918
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:01,394
Negative, Kilo Foxtrot, stand by.

919
01:24:02,062 --> 01:24:05,725
- Colonel, sir.
- So must be real, then.

920
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,094
The pink.

921
01:24:08,602 --> 01:24:11,196
Well, you're part
of this operation now.

922
01:24:11,372 --> 01:24:14,864
First we snuff everything that moves
out there, then we find your diamond.

923
01:24:15,042 --> 01:24:16,669
Colonel?

924
01:24:17,211 --> 01:24:19,645
Go get kitted. Yes?

925
01:24:25,953 --> 01:24:27,944
Move, move, move!

926
01:24:28,155 --> 01:24:31,420
- Go get your kit.
- Will do, chum. Will do.

927
01:24:34,962 --> 01:24:38,125
It's go time, all right?
Meet me behind the tents.

928
01:24:41,235 --> 01:24:42,930
How's Benjamin?

929
01:24:43,103 --> 01:24:44,570
They say he'll live.

930
01:24:45,906 --> 01:24:47,168
Good. Good.

931
01:24:54,581 --> 01:24:56,378
Listen, Maddy...

932
01:24:57,785 --> 01:24:59,548
...I need you to do me one last favor.

933
01:25:00,587 --> 01:25:01,952
Yeah?

934
01:25:03,924 --> 01:25:05,585
Tell that guard
you wanna put him...

935
01:25:05,759 --> 01:25:08,421
<i>...on the cover of Soldier of Fortune
magazine for me.</i>

936
01:25:14,468 --> 01:25:15,696
You're going in.

937
01:25:20,107 --> 01:25:22,371
You and Solomon.

938
01:25:24,545 --> 01:25:25,534
You're going in now.

939
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:28,575
Your plane leaves
in a few minutes, huh?

940
01:25:31,185 --> 01:25:33,153
You're an idiot.

941
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:40,325
- What if I wanted to go in with you?
- I'd say no.

942
01:25:40,494 --> 01:25:42,485
- What if I insist?
- I'd insist back.

943
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:49,796
It's my story.

944
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:53,371
Your story is Van De Kaap, all right?
That stone is mine.

945
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:56,976
I'm not leaving here without it,
you understand?

946
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:01,312
Please, just give me two minutes.

947
01:26:18,065 --> 01:26:19,464
Yeah.

948
01:26:30,777 --> 01:26:32,472
- Hello.
- Hi.

949
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:35,877
<i>My name is Maddy Bowen.
I'm with Vital Affairs magazine.</i>

950
01:26:36,049 --> 01:26:38,517
I was wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.

951
01:26:38,685 --> 01:26:40,209
Well, that depends what they are.

952
01:26:40,387 --> 01:26:44,346
Oh, I see you're familiar
with our devious ways, aren't you?

953
01:26:45,092 --> 01:26:46,992
Okay, so I'll start
with something simple.

954
01:26:59,606 --> 01:27:02,268
And before that you were with
the South African Defense--?

955
01:27:02,442 --> 01:27:04,103
- Defense Force, correct.
- Of course.

956
01:27:04,278 --> 01:27:07,714
And was that with Colonel Coetzee?
Were you in Angola?

957
01:27:07,881 --> 01:27:09,405
Angola, yeah.

958
01:27:11,018 --> 01:27:13,987
That is all I really need to know.
Thank you so much.

959
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:15,654
- Thank you.
- Okay.

960
01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:27,065
Thank you, huh?

961
01:27:27,234 --> 01:27:29,668
Just keeping my end of the deal.

962
01:27:30,270 --> 01:27:31,567
Good luck to you, Solomon.

963
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:33,362
Okay.

964
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:38,375
- I hope you find what you're looking for.
- Thank you for all you have done.

965
01:27:45,819 --> 01:27:48,413
- Listen, I--
- No, you listen.

966
01:27:53,026 --> 01:27:54,926
In another life maybe, all right?

967
01:27:56,363 --> 01:27:58,194
Yeah. Sure.

968
01:27:58,365 --> 01:27:59,730
Yeah.

969
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:06,198
You find yourself a good man,
all right, Maddy?

970
01:28:12,145 --> 01:28:15,171
You know, I've got three sisters.

971
01:28:15,349 --> 01:28:17,977
They're all married to good men.

972
01:28:19,853 --> 01:28:20,911
I prefer my life.

973
01:28:23,557 --> 01:28:28,017
Here is my office phone...

974
01:28:28,195 --> 01:28:30,561
...home phone, cellphone.

975
01:28:32,666 --> 01:28:35,829
I'm used to being pursued,
but what the heck.

976
01:28:47,014 --> 01:28:49,141
You better get on that plane, huh?

977
01:28:50,884 --> 01:28:52,784
You should get on that plane.

978
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:02,758
So should you.

979
01:29:09,236 --> 01:29:10,362
You gonna call me?

980
01:29:14,174 --> 01:29:15,664
Soon as I'm near a phone, yeah.

981
01:29:16,610 --> 01:29:18,976
Yeah, right.

982
01:29:40,801 --> 01:29:44,066
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

983
01:29:48,642 --> 01:29:50,234
Oh, shit.

984
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:53,240
Nabil? Yeah, I'll call you
when we get closer, all right?

985
01:29:53,413 --> 01:29:56,007
You keep me posted. Right.

986
01:29:56,183 --> 01:29:59,983
All right. I set the pace, huh?
Two-hour marches, five-minute breaks.

987
01:30:00,153 --> 01:30:03,987
If I hold my hand up like this, you stop.
If I point to the dirt, you lie flat.

988
01:30:04,157 --> 01:30:07,718
If I say go, you move like your life
depended on it. Understood?

989
01:30:07,894 --> 01:30:10,556
- Yes, boss.
- Come on.

990
01:30:20,841 --> 01:30:22,502
Tell me about the stone.

991
01:30:22,676 --> 01:30:25,304
Is it clear or is it milky?

992
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:27,003
Clear.

993
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:29,580
And the color, is it strong?

994
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:30,978
Does it hold the light?

995
01:30:31,151 --> 01:30:33,210
It is as you say.

996
01:30:33,653 --> 01:30:36,816
- About the size of a bird's egg?
- Yes.

997
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:41,154
One hundred carats.
Come on, let's pick up the pace.

998
01:31:22,736 --> 01:31:24,101
Dia!

999
01:31:26,006 --> 01:31:27,974
Stop the truck!

1000
01:31:28,742 --> 01:31:30,437
I thought it was Dia.

1001
01:32:24,364 --> 01:32:25,922
Wake up.

1002
01:32:27,767 --> 01:32:30,861
Don't worry, they're gone, huh?

1003
01:32:32,205 --> 01:32:35,333
You know, I once had this buddy...

1004
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:37,373
...named Mabhoko.

1005
01:32:38,144 --> 01:32:41,375
We used to hunt bush meat
together as kids, huh?

1006
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:43,547
Baboons.

1007
01:32:43,717 --> 01:32:46,584
Baboons, they were
the hardest to catch. They're...

1008
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:49,018
They're cunning.

1009
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:51,282
Cunning creatures.

1010
01:32:51,558 --> 01:32:54,186
Fast, strong.

1011
01:32:54,361 --> 01:32:56,591
Got good eyesight.

1012
01:32:57,097 --> 01:33:01,124
We would always find them
by the smell of their shit.

1013
01:33:01,301 --> 01:33:06,432
And that's how we learned to track
your black terrorists in Angola, huh?

1014
01:33:10,510 --> 01:33:11,943
By the smell of your shit.

1015
01:33:12,979 --> 01:33:14,446
It's not...

1016
01:33:14,614 --> 01:33:17,344
It's not the same as a baboon's.

1017
01:33:19,586 --> 01:33:23,147
But, you know, after you skin it...

1018
01:33:24,457 --> 01:33:26,687
...the flesh of a baboon...

1019
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:29,360
...isn't that much different
than a man's, you know.

1020
01:33:32,766 --> 01:33:36,702
I'll tell you, I can track anything.

1021
01:33:48,949 --> 01:33:51,110
You risk my life like that again...

1022
01:33:56,489 --> 01:33:58,616
...and I'll peel your face
back off your head.

1023
01:34:01,127 --> 01:34:03,391
Do you understand?

1024
01:34:11,638 --> 01:34:13,697
Make us a fire.

1025
01:35:23,977 --> 01:35:25,569
What'd he say?

1026
01:35:25,745 --> 01:35:27,872
We are going the right way.

1027
01:35:35,021 --> 01:35:37,751
Hold up there, my man.
It's this way, huh?

1028
01:35:39,225 --> 01:35:41,420
Where do you think you are going?

1029
01:35:43,096 --> 01:35:44,757
Stop!

1030
01:35:45,031 --> 01:35:46,726
I said, stop!

1031
01:35:47,167 --> 01:35:48,725
He is not down there, all right?

1032
01:35:50,770 --> 01:35:54,433
All right. You're gonna need
some of that old discipline, huh?

1033
01:35:54,607 --> 01:35:56,871
Now you listen here, my boy,
and you listen well.

1034
01:35:57,043 --> 01:35:59,011
You are not going down there.
Are we clear?

1035
01:35:59,179 --> 01:36:00,806
You are not the master.

1036
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:04,609
Right now, that is exactly what I am,
and you'd better remember it, Kaffir!

1037
01:36:19,766 --> 01:36:21,097
Don't you fucking move, huh?

1038
01:36:21,267 --> 01:36:23,235
Don't you move. Don't you move, huh?

1039
01:36:23,403 --> 01:36:25,735
- My son is there!
- Your son is gone!

1040
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:27,236
- He is alive!
- He's gone!

1041
01:36:27,407 --> 01:36:29,967
He's alive! He's there
with those crazy people!

1042
01:36:31,177 --> 01:36:34,613
I am his father! His father!
I should have protected him!

1043
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:38,983
I must go find him.
I cannot live without knowing!

1044
01:36:39,152 --> 01:36:41,382
Shoot me if you want, but I'm going.

1045
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:46,948
Why should it matter,
I'm dead already.

1046
01:36:54,801 --> 01:36:57,065
We wait until dark, huh?

1047
01:37:26,232 --> 01:37:27,631
Are you satisfied?

1048
01:37:30,603 --> 01:37:33,128
All right, come on.

1049
01:37:37,877 --> 01:37:40,072
<i>--is fighting for Sierra Leone</i>

01:37:59,065 --> 01:38:00,828
Me? I'm 31.

1057

And you have no wife?

1058
01:38:03,636 --> 01:38:06,503
- No.
- No children?

1059
01:38:07,674 --> 01:38:08,971
No.

1060
01:38:09,142 --> 01:38:10,769
And no home?

1061
01:38:10,944 --> 01:38:12,605
No.

1062
01:38:13,313 --> 01:38:15,713
But you have money, yes?

1063
01:38:15,882 --> 01:38:18,146
Yeah, some.

1064
01:38:18,318 --> 01:38:20,309
But not enough?

1065
01:38:22,822 --> 01:38:24,380
No.

1066
01:38:25,124 --> 01:38:29,618
If you get this diamond,
you will have enough money, yes?

1067
01:38:31,764 --> 01:38:32,788
Yes.

1068
01:38:32,966 --> 01:38:35,764
Then you will get
a wife and children?

1069

Probably not, no.

1070
01:38:39,405 --> 01:38:40,394
What?

1071
01:38:42,508 --> 01:38:44,032
What?

1072
01:38:44,444 --> 01:38:46,503
I am confused.

1073
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:49,047
Yeah?

<i>That makes two of us, my bru.</i>

Oh, Christ.
I've gotta quit smoking, huh?

1076
01:38:58,625 --> 01:39:00,593
Why don't you?

1077
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:03,260
I'll tell you what, Solomon.

1078
01:39:03,529 --> 01:39:08,057
You find me this diamond,
and I'll quit right then and there, huh?

1079
01:39:15,475 --> 01:39:18,467
- You were born in Zimbabwe?
- Oh, yeah.

1080
01:39:18,645 --> 01:39:21,808
- Is it beautiful there?
- Sure you're not a reporter?

1081
01:39:22,215 --> 01:39:25,673
Because you ask a hell of a lot
of questions, my man.

1082
01:39:33,326 --> 01:39:37,023
My grandfather told
many stories of war.

1083
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:40,096
How the Mende fought the Temne.

1084
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:43,997
Or how two tribes would fight
when somebody had stolen a woman.

1085
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:57,447
I understand white people
want our diamonds, yes?

1086
01:40:00,486 --> 01:40:04,217
But how can my own people
do this to each other?

1087
01:40:12,498 --> 01:40:14,557
I know good people...

1088
01:40:14,734 --> 01:40:17,601
...who say there is something
wrong with us...

1089
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:19,130
...inside our black skin.

1090
01:40:19,305 --> 01:40:22,638
That we were better off
when the white man ruled.

1091
01:40:24,544 --> 01:40:27,342
But my son is good.

1092
01:40:28,915 --> 01:40:31,110
And when he grows up...

1093
01:40:31,284 --> 01:40:32,512
...and peace comes...

1094
01:40:36,522 --> 01:40:39,184
...this place will be a paradise.

1095
01:40:47,066 --> 01:40:49,534
We'll get your son back, huh?

1096
01:41:31,244 --> 01:41:33,576
Where is it exactly?

1097
01:41:35,114 --> 01:41:38,015
Through the camp, by the river.

1098
01:41:42,622 --> 01:41:44,317
Christ.

1099
01:41:44,791 --> 01:41:46,418
Okay.

1100
01:41:47,059 --> 01:41:48,924
I'm gonna make contact
with the colonel.

1101
01:41:49,095 --> 01:41:50,619
He'll send in an air strike.

1102
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:54,032
- What is that?
- A chopper, huh? An attack helicopter.

1103
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,725
- We use it as a diversion.
- What if my son is there?

1104
01:41:56,903 --> 01:41:58,200
- He isn't.
- How do you know?

1105
01:41:58,371 --> 01:42:01,966
I said we do it my way now, all right?
Don't fuck with me.

1106
01:42:11,884 --> 01:42:14,284
Cordell, it's Danny.

1107
01:42:14,454 --> 01:42:16,786
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up and listen, all right?

1108
01:42:16,956 --> 01:42:19,823
You tell the colonel I've found the stone.

1109
01:42:19,992 --> 01:42:22,961
No, I haven't got it in my hands,
but I'm OP'ing its location.

1110
01:42:23,129 --> 01:42:24,721
It's a major rebel camp, my man.

1111
01:42:24,897 --> 01:42:27,263
You tell him to send in the dakadak.

1112
01:42:27,834 --> 01:42:30,701
Because I stole a GPS, that's how.

1113
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:33,430
If you shut up and listen,
I could give the coordinates.

1114
01:42:33,873 --> 01:42:36,899
Zero-nine-zero-five-four-two-four, north.

1115
01:42:37,076 --> 01:42:41,638
Three-two-seven-two-nine
three-zero-five-zero, east.

1116
01:42:41,814 --> 01:42:44,078
I'll call back at midnight to confirm.

1117
01:42:46,853 --> 01:42:49,788
You can look all night,
my friend, right?

1118
01:42:49,956 --> 01:42:52,618
I promise you he is not there.

1119
01:42:57,864 --> 01:43:00,059
They're coming in the morning, all right?

1120
01:43:00,233 --> 01:43:02,667
No movement, my friend. You stay still.

1121
01:43:04,604 --> 01:43:07,038
When it gets dark,
then we move in closer.

1122
01:43:29,195 --> 01:43:32,187
Solomon. Shit.

1123
01:43:42,975 --> 01:43:44,374
I can do it.

1124
01:43:44,544 --> 01:43:45,636
- Help me.
- Help him.

1125
01:43:45,811 --> 01:43:47,870
Thank you, Papa.

1126
01:44:29,822 --> 01:44:32,052
Hey, you smell.

1127
01:44:33,259 --> 01:44:34,726
That's fine.

1128
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:49,007
- Ready? I'm winning.
- Okay, let's go.

1129
01:44:49,175 --> 01:44:50,836
Play, man.

1130
01:44:52,411 --> 01:44:55,312
- Play. Play the card.
- Play.

1131
01:45:22,108 --> 01:45:23,234
Dia.

1132
01:45:26,278 --> 01:45:27,973
Leave me alone.

1133
01:45:29,015 --> 01:45:32,246
- Dia. I'm your papa. Come with me.
- Hey.

1134
01:45:32,418 --> 01:45:34,147
- Dia.
- Get away from me.

1135
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,117
- Dia. Dia!
- I do not know you. Traitor!

1136
01:45:36,489 --> 01:45:38,980
- Enemy! Enemy!
- What the hell are you doing?

1137
01:45:39,158 --> 01:45:40,386
- What are you doing?
- I don't know you!

1138
01:45:40,559 --> 01:45:41,856
- What's wrong?
- I hate you!

1139
01:45:42,028 --> 01:45:43,757
- Dia, come with me!
- I hate you!

1140
01:45:43,929 --> 01:45:45,453
Get away from me!

1141
01:45:47,933 --> 01:45:49,798
- Get him!
- Don't shoot!

1142
01:45:50,302 --> 01:45:52,532
- Don't shoot! Don't--! Don't shoot!
- I hate you!

1143
01:45:52,705 --> 01:45:54,605
- Fisherman! Traitor!
- Don't shoot!

1144
01:45:54,774 --> 01:45:57,004
Get away from me!

1145
01:46:04,116 --> 01:46:06,277
I knew you would come back.

1146
01:46:06,752 --> 01:46:10,244
I have dug and dug and dug,
but I've found nothing.

1147
01:46:10,423 --> 01:46:12,323
Nothing.

1148
01:46:12,591 --> 01:46:14,081
Dig, dig, dig!

1149
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:16,558
You will find it for me.

1150
01:46:17,530 --> 01:46:19,828
You will dig up
what you have come back for.

1151
01:46:19,999 --> 01:46:21,023
No.

1152
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:23,634
Why should the diamond
go to the foreign devils?

1153
01:46:24,370 --> 01:46:27,635
We will use it
to make the country strong.

1154
01:46:28,107 --> 01:46:30,701
RUF is fighting for the people!

1155
01:46:33,045 --> 01:46:36,139
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

1156
01:46:38,984 --> 01:46:40,713
Pick it up.

1157
01:46:41,921 --> 01:46:44,890
Why? You are going to kill me anyway.

1158
01:46:45,057 --> 01:46:48,151
I do not need to kill you,
Solomon Vandy.

1159
01:46:50,996 --> 01:46:53,191
If you do not bring me the diamond...

1160
01:46:53,365 --> 01:46:55,595
...I will find the rest of your family.

1161
01:46:55,768 --> 01:46:58,202
Just as I have found your son.

1162
01:46:59,305 --> 01:47:02,672
I will rape your wife
in front of your eyes...

1163
01:47:03,476 --> 01:47:05,774
...slit her throat...

1164
01:47:06,378 --> 01:47:08,744
...and I will keep your daughters
for myself.

1165
01:47:14,153 --> 01:47:16,587
You think I am a devil...

1166
01:47:16,756 --> 01:47:19,088
...but only because I have lived in hell.

1167
01:47:20,726 --> 01:47:23,388
I want to get out.

1168
01:47:23,996 --> 01:47:26,089
You will help me.

1169
01:47:28,934 --> 01:47:30,231
I don't remember.

1170
01:47:30,402 --> 01:47:33,371
Find it or your family will die!

1171
01:47:34,306 --> 01:47:36,171
Now pick it up!

1172
01:47:51,724 --> 01:47:53,157
- Go!
- Bastards!

1173
01:47:53,325 --> 01:47:54,690
Shoot it!

1174
01:47:59,665 --> 01:48:00,654
Dia!

1175
01:48:12,745 --> 01:48:14,940
Come, boy. Come. This way. This way.

1176
01:48:15,815 --> 01:48:17,043
Dia!

1177
01:48:39,939 --> 01:48:41,531
<i>Colonel, we think Archer's there.</i>

1178
01:48:41,707 --> 01:48:44,540
I don't give a damn who's down there.
Kill them all.

1179
01:48:54,887 --> 01:48:56,149
Dia!

1180
01:49:10,903 --> 01:49:12,200
I'm coming!

1181
01:49:15,741 --> 01:49:17,402
- Dia!
- Bastard!

1182
01:49:40,566 --> 01:49:41,931
No!

1183
01:50:02,021 --> 01:50:03,352
Dia!

1184
01:51:09,588 --> 01:51:12,523
- We found his digger, sir.
- Keep him close.

1185
01:51:14,493 --> 01:51:16,688
- Danny boy.
- Colonel.

1186
01:51:16,862 --> 01:51:20,229
- Thanks for calling it in.
- Yeah, yeah. Always happy to help, huh?

1187
01:51:20,399 --> 01:51:23,732
So where is it? The stone?

1188
01:51:23,902 --> 01:51:25,836
We split, huh? Fifty-fifty, all right?

1189
01:51:26,005 --> 01:51:27,632
Look around you, Danny boy.

1190
01:51:27,806 --> 01:51:30,775
You're not in a position
to be dictating terms.

1191
01:51:30,943 --> 01:51:33,036
Then you will never find it, sir.

1192
01:51:33,212 --> 01:51:34,839
That's correct.

1193
01:51:36,515 --> 01:51:39,143
- But he will.
- Come. Up.

1194
01:51:40,786 --> 01:51:43,016
Introduce me to your digger.

1195
01:51:44,590 --> 01:51:46,251
Solomon Vandy.

1196
01:51:46,425 --> 01:51:48,586
This is Colonel Coetzee.
He wants the diamond.

1197
01:51:48,761 --> 01:51:51,787
- No more than you.
- Fuck.

1198
01:51:51,964 --> 01:51:53,955
You gonna show us where it's hidden?

1199
01:51:56,635 --> 01:51:58,330
Does he speak English?

1200
01:51:58,504 --> 01:52:01,530
He will only tell me, sir.
I promise you that.

1201
01:52:02,374 --> 01:52:05,434
- Let me talk to him, huh?
- Go on.

1202
01:52:12,184 --> 01:52:14,550
All right, my friend.

1203
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:16,654
End of the line here, huh?

1204
01:52:16,822 --> 01:52:20,087
- You just tell him where it is, all right?
- I do not trust him.

1205
01:52:20,259 --> 01:52:23,695
I don't trust him either,
but we haven't got much of a choice here.

1206
01:52:25,397 --> 01:52:28,525
I promise you
he will shoot us both in the head.

1207
01:52:28,967 --> 01:52:31,731
Right, tell him, huh?
Tell him where it is, huh?

1208
01:52:31,904 --> 01:52:34,498
- Go on. Come on.
- I'm not feeling the love, Danny.

1209
01:52:35,707 --> 01:52:38,540
All right.
No more messing about, all right?

1210
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:41,702
I said tell him where it is!
Tell him where it is! Now!

1211
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:43,541
Tell him!

1212
01:52:44,716 --> 01:52:46,513
- No.
- Fucking--

1213
01:52:46,685 --> 01:52:49,381
Danny, there are other ways
to do this, okay?

1214
01:52:49,555 --> 01:52:51,182
Yeah, yeah.

1215
01:52:59,364 --> 01:53:02,356
- If he tells us, do we have a deal, sir?
- Seventy-thirty.

1216
01:53:02,534 --> 01:53:04,934
Sixty-forty. I've already lined up a buyer.

1217
01:53:05,104 --> 01:53:06,765
Agreed.

1218
01:53:11,944 --> 01:53:13,502
Come here.

1219
01:53:16,081 --> 01:53:19,517
This is his son. Vandy will do
whatever you want for his sake, all right?

1220
01:53:19,685 --> 01:53:24,452
Danny, you're a pisser, man. Well done.
Boys, we move out.

1221
01:53:27,226 --> 01:53:29,524
What do you say, Mr. Vandy?

1222
01:53:29,995 --> 01:53:32,896
- You ready to take a walk?
- Come on.

1223
01:53:39,171 --> 01:53:40,763
Come on.

1224
01:53:53,719 --> 01:53:56,813
So who's the buyer?
I'm guessing London.

1225
01:53:57,022 --> 01:54:00,287
Well, they no longer accept
conflict diamonds, huh?

1226
01:54:00,459 --> 01:54:02,927
Wouldn't hurt to interest
some other parties.

1227
01:54:03,462 --> 01:54:06,454
- Start a bidding war.
- What, one war's not enough for you, huh?

1228
01:54:07,399 --> 01:54:09,094
I missed you, Danny.

1229
01:54:09,401 --> 01:54:13,565
See? It is here.
He has tried to find it.

1230
01:54:13,739 --> 01:54:16,435
All right, Mr. Vandy.
Time for you to start digging.

1231
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:33,754
<i>Hey, boet, have you got a smoke?</i>

1232
01:54:34,226 --> 01:54:36,126
Smoking will kill you.

1233
01:54:36,895 --> 01:54:38,385
Sorry.

1234
01:54:41,466 --> 01:54:43,366
It's all right.

1235
01:54:43,535 --> 01:54:45,662
Time I quit smoking anyway,
huh, Solomon?

1236
01:55:00,185 --> 01:55:01,516
- It's gone.
- What?

1237
01:55:01,687 --> 01:55:03,780
Someone has taken it.

1238
01:55:04,890 --> 01:55:08,656
This is where I buried it.
It isn't here.

1239
01:55:09,127 --> 01:55:12,494
Well, then there's no reason
for any of you to stay alive. Is there?

1240
01:55:16,835 --> 01:55:18,496
Wait, wait, wait.

1241
01:55:18,670 --> 01:55:20,900
I know, I know. I know where it is.

1242
01:55:21,373 --> 01:55:23,364
- I know where it is.
- It better be there.

1243
01:55:28,547 --> 01:55:29,536
Yes.

1244
01:55:29,715 --> 01:55:33,082
Oh, here, here.
It is here.

1245
01:55:33,252 --> 01:55:34,913
- Yeah? Yeah, there it is.
- Yes.

1246
01:55:36,088 --> 01:55:37,487
Fuck!

1247
01:55:56,141 --> 01:55:58,075
TIA, huh, Danny?

1248
01:55:59,478 --> 01:56:01,070
TIA.

1249
01:56:07,986 --> 01:56:11,444
Keep digging, huh?
They'll be here any second. Come on.

1250
01:56:13,659 --> 01:56:14,921
Keep digging.

1251
01:56:27,773 --> 01:56:30,503
- It had better be there, huh?
- Yes, yes.

1252
01:56:33,545 --> 01:56:35,137
Have you got it?

1253
01:56:36,581 --> 01:56:39,846
- Have you got it, huh?
- Yes, got it. Oh, yes.

1254
01:56:41,286 --> 01:56:42,548
Oh, yes.

1255
01:56:44,723 --> 01:56:46,315
Solomon.

1256
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:56,100
Dia, what are you doing?

1257
01:56:56,601 --> 01:56:58,091
Dia.

1258
01:57:00,439 --> 01:57:02,339
What are you doing?

1259
01:57:07,212 --> 01:57:08,509
Of the proud Mende tribe.

1260
01:57:14,453 --> 01:57:19,322
You are a good boy
who loves soccer and school.

1261
01:57:21,626 --> 01:57:24,754
Your mother loves you so much.

1262
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:29,997
She waits by the fire making plantains...

1263
01:57:30,168 --> 01:57:32,830
...and red palm oil stew
with your sister N'Yanda...

1264
01:57:35,107 --> 01:57:37,371
...and the new baby.

1265
01:57:46,284 --> 01:57:48,548
The cows wait for you.

1266
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:54,522
And Babu, the wild dog
who minds no one but you.

1267
01:57:57,095 --> 01:58:00,428
I know they made you do bad things...

1268
01:58:00,599 --> 01:58:03,067
...but you are not a bad boy.

1269
01:58:06,271 --> 01:58:08,671
I am your father...

1270
01:58:10,375 --> 01:58:12,673
...who loves you.

1271
01:58:13,945 --> 01:58:17,711
And you will come home with me
and be my son again.

1272
01:58:43,141 --> 01:58:45,507
Solomon, we've got to move, huh?

1273
01:58:45,677 --> 01:58:47,235
We've got to--

1274
01:58:50,415 --> 01:58:53,111
Go, go! Move!

1275
01:58:55,887 --> 01:58:57,445
Move. Move.

1276
01:58:57,622 --> 01:58:58,919
Move, move, move!

1277
01:58:59,090 --> 01:59:02,116
Move! Move! Move!

1278
01:59:03,728 --> 01:59:04,956
How far?

1279
01:59:05,130 --> 01:59:07,189
There's an airstrip
at the top of that gorge.

1280
01:59:07,365 --> 01:59:09,458
A plane will meet us, huh?

1281
01:59:09,868 --> 01:59:12,234
Hey, stop. Stop.

1282
01:59:14,506 --> 01:59:18,499
Give it to me.
Come on, give it to me, huh?

1283
01:59:26,017 --> 01:59:29,077
Keep moving. They'll be tracking us.

1284
01:59:35,393 --> 01:59:37,452
Nabil, where are you?

1285
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:41,158
I'm nearly there.
Tell me what's happening.

1286
01:59:41,333 --> 01:59:44,791
We're about 10 K's out, huh?
We've got it, my friend.

1287
01:59:44,970 --> 01:59:46,870
<i>- Who is we?
- The fisherman and his son.</i>

1288
01:59:47,038 --> 01:59:48,630
<i>Lose them.</i>

1289
02:00:02,787 --> 02:00:04,880
It's at the top of that ridge there, huh?

1290
02:00:05,056 --> 02:00:06,353
You must stop and rest.

1291
02:00:06,525 --> 02:00:09,358
What? And give up the damn stone?

1292
02:00:09,528 --> 02:00:11,587
Keep moving. Come on.

1293
02:00:46,231 --> 02:00:48,563
Come. Come, come.

1294
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:37,978
I can't. Stop.

1295
02:01:38,149 --> 02:01:40,208
- Okay.
- Stop.

1296
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:09,772
Come on.

1297
02:02:10,382 --> 02:02:12,976
No! God, no. Stop.

1298
02:02:14,085 --> 02:02:17,418
Christ. No more. No more.

1299
02:03:01,366 --> 02:03:03,061
Take it, huh?

1300
02:03:05,470 --> 02:03:08,667
- Mr. Archer--
- Take it, take it.

1301
02:03:15,747 --> 02:03:17,510
I thought you would steal it from me.

1302
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:22,979
Yeah, yeah, it occurred to me, huh?

1303
02:03:33,932 --> 02:03:35,559
Listen...

1304
02:03:38,536 --> 02:03:40,936
...this is Maddy's card, huh?

1305
02:03:41,106 --> 02:03:43,267
You call her when
you get to Conakry, all right?

1306
02:03:47,512 --> 02:03:49,480
And don't trust that pilot for a second.

1307
02:03:49,647 --> 02:03:52,707
You point this at his head
if he fucks around, all right?

1308
02:03:52,884 --> 02:03:54,351
I can carry you.

1309
02:04:07,265 --> 02:04:08,732
You take your boy home, huh?

1310
02:04:13,905 --> 02:04:16,567
You take him home, huh?

1311
02:04:21,112 --> 02:04:22,875
- Go! Go!
- Go. Come on.

1312
02:04:23,715 --> 02:04:24,807
Go on!

1313
02:04:30,555 --> 02:04:32,420
Come on. Come on.

1314
02:04:39,230 --> 02:04:41,596
Archer, you're a dead man!

1315
02:04:41,766 --> 02:04:43,597
Yeah, yeah.

1316
02:05:14,299 --> 02:05:15,664
Dia.

1317
02:05:36,888 --> 02:05:38,048
Hello. Maddy Bowen.

1318
02:05:38,289 --> 02:05:40,120
Yeah.

1319
02:05:40,458 --> 02:05:42,119
Thought I'd never call, huh?

1320
02:05:43,027 --> 02:05:47,088
And I'm so glad you did.
Excuse me.

1321
02:05:49,067 --> 02:05:50,227
When am I gonna see you?

1322
02:05:51,369 --> 02:05:57,103
Maddy, I want you to do me
one more favor, huh?

1323
02:05:57,809 --> 02:06:02,337
I want you to go meet Solomon
in Conakry.

1324
02:06:02,547 --> 02:06:05,243
In Guinea?
Why do you want me to go to Guinea?

1325
02:06:08,253 --> 02:06:10,312
We found his son...

1326
02:06:11,289 --> 02:06:14,690
...but he's gonna need some help,
you understand?

1327
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:16,552
<i>Maddy?</i>

1328
02:06:19,364 --> 02:06:21,229
You're hurt.

1329
02:06:21,866 --> 02:06:22,924
Are you hurt?

1330
02:06:23,101 --> 02:06:26,264
Yeah, well, I've got
a little problem here.

1331
02:06:30,842 --> 02:06:34,539
Okay. You--
You tell me where you are.

1332
02:06:37,815 --> 02:06:38,839
<i>Archer?</i>

1333
02:06:50,995 --> 02:06:55,728
I'm looking at an incredible view
right now.

1334
02:06:57,135 --> 02:06:58,762
I wish you were here, Maddy.

1335
02:06:58,937 --> 02:07:02,600
Okay, then I'm coming to be with you.
You just tell me where you are.

1336
02:07:05,810 --> 02:07:07,141
I don't think so.

1337
02:07:07,312 --> 02:07:10,645
Are you still in Kono? Because I can
get someone there to help you.

1338
02:07:10,815 --> 02:07:15,081
Maddy, you find someplace safe
for the boy, all right?

1339
02:07:15,253 --> 02:07:17,653
<i>And keep him out of sight.</i>

1340
02:07:18,256 --> 02:07:20,986
<i>And get Solomon to London.</i>

1341
02:07:24,128 --> 02:07:26,892
He's bringing something with him.

1342
02:07:27,565 --> 02:07:29,499
But he's gonna need your help.

1343
02:07:30,735 --> 02:07:32,566
Why aren't you bringing it yourself?

1344
02:07:34,072 --> 02:07:39,135
I'm saying it's a real story now.

1345
02:07:40,044 --> 02:07:41,773
And you can write the hell out of it.

1346
02:07:48,987 --> 02:07:51,512
I'm really happy I met you.

1347
02:07:53,091 --> 02:07:54,080
You know that?

1348
02:07:57,428 --> 02:07:59,555
Yeah, I'm...

1349
02:08:00,765 --> 02:08:03,825
I'm really happy I met you too.

1350
02:08:04,435 --> 02:08:08,428
<i>And I wish I could be there with you.</i>

1351
02:08:09,307 --> 02:08:11,275
That's all right.

1352
02:08:13,811 --> 02:08:16,211
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

1353
02:09:09,834 --> 02:09:12,166
When we get to the stairs,
you just keep walking...

1354
02:09:12,336 --> 02:09:14,361
...and I'll wait for you here.

1355
02:09:14,939 --> 02:09:16,463
You're not coming.

1356
02:09:16,641 --> 02:09:19,906
I'm not here. Good luck.

1357
02:09:41,566 --> 02:09:44,228
You must understand, Mr. Vandy...

1358
02:09:44,402 --> 02:09:50,466
...that your diamond could have ended up
nowhere else but with us.

1359
02:09:53,778 --> 02:09:56,747
- It is not enough.
- I assure you, 2 million pounds...

1360
02:09:56,914 --> 02:10:00,782
...is more than anyone else will offer you
for that stone under the circumstances.

1361
02:10:00,952 --> 02:10:03,648
I want what was promised to me
by Mr. Archer.

1362
02:10:07,125 --> 02:10:09,650
- What was promised to you?
- My family.

1363
02:10:09,994 --> 02:10:11,985
When they are here,
you will get the stone.

1364
02:10:12,663 --> 02:10:14,290
I will have the money too.

1365
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:17,124
Well, may I see what I'm buying?

1366
02:10:17,301 --> 02:10:20,065
You will get the stone
once my family is here.

1367
02:10:20,838 --> 02:10:22,635
How do I even know you've got it?

1368
02:12:30,534 --> 02:12:33,298
Can you comment on the diamonds
mined in Sierra Leone?

1369
02:12:33,471 --> 02:12:37,373
I'm not going to comment
on some sensationalist magazine article.

1370
02:12:37,541 --> 02:12:40,135
- What about Liberia?
- No comment. No comment.

1371
02:12:40,311 --> 02:12:42,711
- Mr. Van De Kaap--
- That's all I have to say.

1372
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:44,279
The natural resources
of a country...

1373
02:12:46,284 --> 02:12:49,253
...are the property of its people.
They are not ours to steal...

1374
02:12:50,588 --> 02:12:56,049
<i>...or exploit in the name of our comfort,
our corporations, or our consumerism.</i>

1375
02:13:05,970 --> 02:13:08,029
They're ready for you, sir.

1376
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:11,940
The Third World is not a world apart.

1377
02:13:12,109 --> 02:13:16,773
And the witness you will hear today
speaks on its behalf.

1378
02:13:16,947 --> 02:13:20,815
Let us hear the voice of that world.
Let us learn from that voice.

1379
02:13:20,985 --> 02:13:24,512
And let us ignore it no more.

1380
02:13:24,689 --> 02:13:28,022
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Solomon Vandy.
