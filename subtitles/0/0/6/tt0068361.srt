1
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,627
THE DISCREET CHARM
OF THE BOURGEOISIE

2
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,062
Shall I wait here, Your Excellency?

3
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:34,693
Yes, yes

4
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,567
There's not even a fire.

5
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,487
And the table isn't set yet.

6
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,063
But it's after 8.

7
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,456
Good evening, dear Alice.

8
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,050
- Don Rafael, how are you?
- Just fine.

9
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,850
- I'm so glad to see you again.
- So am l.

10
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,918
What a surprise!

11
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,619
Had I known you were coming...

12
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,222
You weren't expecting us?

13
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,383
No, not tonight.

14
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:45,887
Not tonight?

15
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,681
No. I was expecting you tomorrow.

16
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,370
Tomorrow?

17
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,907
But Henri's invitation
was for tonight.

18
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,388
I'm sure of that.

19
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,697
That can't be...

20
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:04,366
- because Henri is at a business dinner.
- Incredible!

21
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,378
But I was there when he invited us.

22
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,039
In any case, tomorrow night is out.

23
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,880
I couldn't have accepted. I've a
dinner at the Colombian Embassy.

24
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,251
I really don't know what to say.

25
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,966
I'd invite you to eat with me,
but nothing is ready.

26
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:29,488
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Don't be. It's nothing.

27
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,488
A slight misunderstanding.

28
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,387
Won't you sit down?
Have a drink.

29
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,009
Don't put yourself out.
We'll be going.

30
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,307
By the way,

31
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:46,324
I know a charming inn nearby.
I've dined there on occasion.

32
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,205
- Let's try it. Be my guests.
- Good idea.

33
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,456
Why don't you join us?

34
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,947
That's sweet, but I'm not dressed.

35
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:56,287
No matter. It's quite
an informal place.

36
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:02,239
- Then I'll just change my dress.
- Not at all. Come as you are.

37
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,345
Not very cheerful.

38
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,266
Put this on.

39
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,719
Maybe it's closed.

40
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,639
The food's good. I'll check.

41
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,698
It's nothing special.

42
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:06,706
Yes?

43
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,161
We'd like to have dinner.
Are you closed?

44
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:13,039
- Then we can dine?
- Of course. One moment...

45
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,120
What's the meaning of this?
Call the manager, Mr. Manuel.

46
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:20,073
The management changed
3 months ago.

47
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:21,672
Good evening, Madame.

48
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:22,773
Please come in.

49
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,459
Let's go.

50
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,533
Not very crowded.

51
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,756
- A bad sign.
- Maybe it's early.

52
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,719
Let's sit here.

53
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,449
You sit there.

54
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,793
Shall we start with the wine,
my friends?

55
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,824
It depends on what we order.

56
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,629
What do you prefer?
Bordeaux? Burgundy?

57
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:04,731
Burgundy.

58
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,849
Whether I have oysters or fish,
I go with red wine...

59
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,640
"Snails cooked in Chablis."

60
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,979
I don't care for snails.

61
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,600
I'd fancy a hare terrine,
but in restaurants

62
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,909
they tend to use too much salt...

63
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:30,781
There's melon.

64
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,102
Good idea.
I'll have a melon with port.

65
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:42,372
I'd have caviar, but It might not
be very good here.

66
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,810
I prefer my own caviar.

67
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,152
What do they have for fish?
I adore fish.

68
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,931
There's grilled sardines,
fillet of sole,

69
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,640
fried whiting,
brown-buttered skate,

70
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,801
pike quenelles in Nantua sauce,
blue trout...

71
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,127
This restaurant's cheap.

72
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,069
A cheap, empty restaurant
is dubious.

73
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,007
Think so?

74
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,779
I'll skip the melon and have
a dry martini instead.

75
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,870
Nothing but red wine for you.

76
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,048
And Cremant to make
Picard happy.

77
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,817
- What's going on?
- Where are you going? Stay here.

78
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,073
That's being indiscreet.

79
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,356
We'll have

80
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,071
a melon with port...
a plain melon...

81
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,789
The lady here will have roll mops...

82
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:55,828
What's going on?

83
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,789
The owner, Madame.
He died suddenly this afternoon.

84
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,520
We were so fond of him.

85
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,752
- He died in that suit?
- But why keep him here?

86
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,913
We're expecting the undertaker.

87
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,990
But we remain at your service.

88
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,509
I'm leaving. I won't eat here.

89
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,749
- Why not?
- You can't be serious, Rafael!

90
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,211
I don't mind.

91
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,641
But I assure you,
you'll have a fine dinner.

92
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,089
- No, I'm going.
- As you like.

93
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,566
- What shall we do?
- Try another place.

94
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:30,278
If you don't mind, I'd rather
go home. Will you take me?

95
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,619
Yes, with pleasure.

96
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,908
Mr. Senechal and Mr. Thevenot
are here.

97
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,300
Show them in.

98
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,091
Hello, Henri.

99
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:21,964
Hello, Francois. Please...

100
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,129
What happened last night?

101
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,583
- Why did you come by?
- You invited us.

102
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,380
You're mistaken.
It was for tonight.

103
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,929
I could never have accepted.
I'm engaged tonight.

104
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,330
I don't understand.
Are you free for lunch Saturday?

105
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,459
Let me check.

106
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:51,108
Saturday's fine with Francois.
About one o'clock.

107
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,739
I have nothing planned.

108
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,119
We'll be expecting you, then.

109
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:57,242
Say...

110
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,927
there's quite a pretty girl outside.

111
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,470
Well, well...

112
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,417
What are you doing?

113
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,647
- Put that down!
- Stand back!

114
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,660
I know what I'm doing.

115
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,442
- Who is she?
- She's from Miranda.

116
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:58,423
Miranda?

117
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:04,351
She's part of a terrorist group
that's been after me for years.

118
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:08,019
- To do what?
- How's that, to do what?

119
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,990
To kidnap me, murder me.
You never know with terrorists.

120
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,509
Did you notify the police?

121
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:18,446
I'd rather not, for the moment.
You understand why.

122
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,721
I had some trouble at the airport.

123
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,683
They wanted to search
my diplomatic pouch.

124
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,302
I had to call the minister.

125
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,835
Search the diplomatic pouch...
Unthinkable!

126
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:36,056
Last month,
they arrested the ambassador of...

127
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:41,674
An ambassador carrying
40 kilos of cocaine.

128
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:45,097
An ambassador? Which one?

129
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,880
They hushed up the affair.
There are 1 5 kilos here.

130
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,039
It didn't get into the press.

131
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:00,332
It was the U.S. ambassador.

132
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,282
That makes the 4th ambassador
to be arrested.

133
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,493
We have to find another system.

134
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,818
- Want to test it?
- Harrison's radar?

135
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,441
- It's the best.
- I have a sample.

136
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:15,962
Your hand.

137
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:30,193
It's pure.

138
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,080
The finest.

139
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,159
I have the first payment.

140
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,340
You can count it.

141
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,034
I trust you.

142
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,087
The Marseilles gang
is getting suspicious.

143
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:50,329
They want to know
who our supplier is.

144
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,540
That's bad news.

145
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:53,974
It's no use worrying now.

146
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:57,513
Skip it.
Where will you invest the money?

147
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,838
Certainly not in Miranda.

148
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,837
Same place as you.

149
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,522
- What's the Deutsche mark at now?
- 3.1 7 to the dollar.

150
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,508
Shall I wait here, Your Excellency?

151
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:44,956
- Are Monsieur and Madame home?
- Yes, I'll let them know.

152
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:52,739
Smells good.

153
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:56,998
Surely a vol-au-vent
a la financiere.

154
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,459
So about the population explosion...

155
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:02,984
I'll explain.

156
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,169
This is the Earth.

157
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:07,425
That's the zodiac.

158
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,056
Come on.

159
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,218
- Yes?
- The guests are here, sir.

160
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:25,109
We'll be right down.
Serve them drinks.

161
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,670
They can wait 5 minutes.
Come on...

162
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,576
- Not here!
- Why not?

163
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,523
You make too much noise.

164
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,463
What'll we do?

165
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,502
Don't stand there, get dressed.

166
00:16:57,226 --> 00:17:00,645
They'll be right down.
Help yourselves to drinks.

167
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:01,046
Fine.

168
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,796
- What will it be?
- As you like.

169
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,611
- Same for me.
- How about you, Florence?

170
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:09,942
I wouldn't mind...

171
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,280
a dry martini.

172
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:17,320
My sister shouldn't drink.
You should've seen her last night.

173
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:21,271
She was dead drunk.
She threw up everywhere.

174
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,627
In the elevator, in the taxi.
It was awful.

175
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:28,198
- And her fingernails were filthy.
- They were not!

176
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,776
You're the one who...

177
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,362
Dry martinis for everyone?

178
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,433
There's nothing more relaxing
than a dry martini.

179
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:44,146
I read it in a woman's magazine.

180
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,237
I'll mix them.

181
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,819
I'm afraid these glasses
are out of style.

182
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,840
For a dry martini the classic
cone-shaped glass is best.

183
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:55,977
Here's one.

184
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,127
This is just about right.

185
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,297
The ice cubes come first.

186
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:06,842
They have to be first-rate.
Very cold, very hard.

187
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,699
About 20 to 30 degrees below zero.
Like these.

188
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,434
What are you doing?

189
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,619
Then we pour the gin.

190
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,633
Stir to cool it, then serve.

191
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:12,512
Rafael knows a dry martini
must be sipped like champagne.

192
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,139
We'll try something.
Get your chauffeur.

193
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:20,861
What do you want with him?

194
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:22,522
You'll see.

195
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,309
Honey, if you prefer
the 30's New York style,

196
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:33,012
you can add a few
drops of Pernod.

197
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:34,379
Maurice!

198
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:39,853
- Come in a minute?
- Right away, Your Excellency.

199
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,923
Do us the pleasure
of having a drink with us.

200
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:01,509
Thank you, sir.

201
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:07,104
- Your health, ladies and gentlemen.
- And yours.

202
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:16,402
That's fine, Maurice.
You may go now.

203
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,659
Did you see that?

204
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:28,019
That was precisely the way
not to drink a dry martini.

205
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,560
You're being hard on Maurice.
He's a commoner. He's uneducated.

206
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:36,643
No system can give the masses
the proper social graces.

207
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:40,012
But you know me,
I'm not a reactionary.

208
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:45,361
Where are our hosts?

209
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:48,748
I don't know, Madame. They left.

210
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:50,429
What do you mean, left?

211
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:53,001
I saw them running into the garden.

212
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,919
- When was this?
- 4 or 5 minutes ago.

213
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,051
- Where were they going?
- I don't know.

214
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:01,332
Excuse me, Madame.

215
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:03,732
What's the meaning of this?

216
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:04,794
I don't know.

217
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:09,268
Someone may have informed the police.
A raid.

218
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,000
You think so?

219
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:14,228
Why else would they run off
like that?

220
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:18,706
- They could have warned us!
- They may not have had time.

221
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:21,219
- Let's get out of here.
- Right.

222
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,507
Come on, quick!

223
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,035
- We have to go!
- Why?

224
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,536
But we're fine here.

225
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,293
We must get out of here.

226
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,318
And go where?

227
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,580
Never you mind. Come on.

228
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,606
Get going. And fast.

229
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:32,142
I'm Monsignor Dufour,
bishop of this diocese.

230
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:35,251
Are Mr. and Mrs. Senechal at home?

231
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,136
No, Your Grace, they're not.

232
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:41,027
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

233
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:43,998
They had lunch guests,
but they all left.

234
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:47,809
- Will they be back?
- I think so, Your Grace.

235
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:50,986
- May I wait for them?
- Why, of course.

236
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,830
I'd like to sit down,
if you have no objections.

237
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:00,893
- I'm a bit tired.
- Please do, Your Grace.

238
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,103
You walked all the way?

239
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,109
I had a car, but
I sold it to help the poor.

240
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:12,393
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you, I don't drink.

241
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,349
Tell me, my dear...
what is your name?

242
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:15,962
Ines.

243
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:18,741
Tell me, dear lnes...

244
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:22,304
Is that the gardener's shed
I saw as I came up?

245
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,112
Yes, it is, Your Grace.

246
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:27,532
But the gardener was
fired last week.

247
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:28,453
Yes, I know.

248
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,460
- Excuse me, I have work to do.
- Go right ahead.

249
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:30,691
What excuse do we give?

250
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,368
- Where are they?
- Who, Madame?

251
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,787
- The guests! Where are they?
- They left.

252
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,178
What got into them?

253
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:03,026
We were barely out 20 minutes.

254
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:05,762
They had enough to drink.

255
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,683
You don't just leave like that!

256
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,297
Why not stop them?

257
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,929
They looked scared. They ran out.

258
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,860
- Scared?
- Scared of what?

259
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:26,208
Good Morning.

260
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,698
I'm Your Monsignor Dufour,
bishop of this diocese.

261
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,719
I'd like to speak with you.

262
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:36,868
What was that?

263
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:41,117
It's true. His Grace came
by before. I let him in...

264
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:44,583
Who's he kidding?
Will you get the hell out!

265
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:44,968
Out!

266
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:51,192
You let in strangers just like that?

267
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:53,427
He said he was a bishop.

268
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:54,938
And you believed him?

269
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,578
If we're out, beware of strangers.

270
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:58,840
Remember that!

271
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:00,756
Very well, Madame.

272
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:07,756
Come on, let's tidy up a bit.

273
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,929
I wonder why they were scared.

274
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,823
Thevenot's always scared.

275
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:17,313
The Embassy might know something.

276
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:20,538
Wait a bit. I bet they'll come back.

277
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:23,389
You're right.
Anyway, the day's ruined.

278
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:31,511
That's them.

279
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:47,574
You see? Do you believe me now?

280
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:51,771
- I don't understand.
- Shame on us.

281
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:53,092
It's nothing.

282
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:57,158
- Will you forgive us?
- Of course. It's nothing serious.

283
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,829
Won't you have a seat?

284
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:03,331
Dear Madame,
haven't we met before?

285
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:04,382
Quite possibly.

286
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:11,603
To what do we owe this honor?

287
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:15,092
It's quite simple.
I'd like to be your gardener.

288
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:17,493
- Excuse me?
- Your gardener, yes.

289
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:22,303
Tend your garden... the vegetables,
the flowers, the lawn.

290
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,910
- You do need a gardener?
- Yes, we do.

291
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,610
Then I'm asking for the position.

292
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:32,213
- But, Your Grace...
- Don't be surprised.

293
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:35,043
The Church has changed,
you know.

294
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,782
You've heard of worker priests?

295
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:40,769
The same goes for bishops.

296
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:46,261
- You know about gardening?
- I should think so.

297
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,870
I spent my childhood
in a large house...

298
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,403
something like this one.

299
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:58,919
My parents... God rest their souls,
they both died violent deaths.

300
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:03,559
My parents had a fine gardener.
I learned everything from him.

301
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:07,729
- Your parents died violent deaths?
- Yes, arsenic poisoning.

302
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:09,132
Who did it?

303
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:11,497
We never found out.

304
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,420
How much do you want?

305
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,928
Union rates. No more, no less.

306
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:20,449
But our ex-gardener
wasn't unionized.

307
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,770
Maybe so, but I insist
on doing this properly.

308
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:26,492
So, is the answer yes?

309
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:30,919
Very well.

310
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:36,939
- When will you start?
- Now. If you'd show me the garden...

311
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:37,699
This way.

312
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:39,797
Excuse me...

313
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:42,459
You have grass in your hair.

314
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:44,704
It's nothing.

315
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:47,810
- Shall we?
- Indeed.

316
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,381
See you later, Madame.

317
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:03,572
- What will you ladies have?
- Three teas.

318
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:06,305
- Milk or lemon?
- Lemon for me.

319
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:06,936
Me, too.

320
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:09,588
Some milk, please.

321
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:19,402
I can't stand the sight
of that musician.

322
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:20,153
Which one?

323
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:21,441
The cellist.

324
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:28,547
- Why? You don't like the cello?
- I detest it.

325
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:31,149
Do you mind if we change places?

326
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:31,920
Why not?

327
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,349
Personally, I really like the cello.

328
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:46,321
- The sound...
- Most orchestras have dropped them.

329
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:48,202
Look at that!

330
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:58,233
If they were young, at least...

331
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:04,052
- See that?
- See what?

332
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:07,692
The soldier sitting over there.

333
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,538
He's a lieutenant.

334
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,459
- You know him?
- No, why?

335
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,139
He keeps staring at us.

336
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:19,949
I don't know him.

337
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,027
Neither do l.

338
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,121
Did you notice how sad he looks?

339
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,670
True. But lieutenants often do.
I've always wondered why.

340
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:37,647
I'm terribly sorry, ladies,
but we're out of tea.

341
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:40,149
No tea! What's the meaning of this?

342
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:44,220
We've been very busy today.
We just served our last tea.

343
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:46,568
- No tea at all?
- None, Madame.

344
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,738
Will you have something else?

345
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:51,394
- Then I'll have a coffee
- Me too.

346
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:55,122
- Me too. With a brandy.
- We don't sell alcohol, Miss.

347
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,523
Three coffees, then.

348
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:11,266
If I may... Hubert de Rochcahin,
cavalry lieutenant.

349
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:13,082
May I join you?

350
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:14,517
Of course.

351
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:21,364
Madame, did you have
a happy childhood?

352
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:22,912
Yes. Quite happy.

353
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:25,396
And you, Madame?

354
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:29,013
Me, too...
I have nothing but good memories.

355
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:29,602
Not me.

356
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:34,009
I had several complexes:
Euclid's complex...

357
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:38,088
My childhood was tragic.
May I tell you about it?

358
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:42,666
- Here? Now?
- Yes. It's a bit long, but interesting.

359
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:43,716
If you like.

360
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,820
I remember, I was 1 1 .

361
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:50,231
I was about to enter
military school.

362
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,729
Not too tight under the arms?

363
00:32:55,434 --> 00:32:56,944
Button up your tunic.

364
00:32:58,437 --> 00:32:59,707
There, that's it.

365
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:03,116
It's fine.

366
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,782
Your father wants to see you.

367
00:33:12,493 --> 00:33:14,993
- Your son, sir.
- You can go now.

368
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:16,897
Turn.

369
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:22,041
Walk a little.

370
00:33:27,466 --> 00:33:27,866
Fine.

371
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:30,613
Now listen to me.

372
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,889
Your mother is dead. I'm
responsible for your education.

373
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,990
At military school
discipline will be harsh.

374
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,580
But it's for your own good.

375
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:44,963
I hope you will do credit
to the name I gave you.

376
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:46,962
That will be all.

377
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:22,707
Mother!

378
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:39,136
MOTHER, I LO...

379
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,710
Hubert, my son. It's me.

380
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,218
Don't be afraid.

381
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:55,063
Come here. Don't be afraid.

382
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:57,869
Listen to me.

383
00:34:58,807 --> 00:34:59,677
Come closer.

384
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:06,105
The man who lives in this house
and calls you son is not your father.

385
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:07,386
Do you understand?

386
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:11,004
Look. Your real father is there.

387
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:16,579
The other one killed him in a duel.
We were deeply in love.

388
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:22,563
Now, listen to me.
Don't be afraid.

389
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,700
Your so-called father usually
wakes at night for a glass of milk.

390
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,410
In the bathroom cabinet
you'll find a blue vial.

391
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:36,489
Tonight, when he's asleep,
go and empty it into his glass.

392
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:39,499
It's your mother's last request.

393
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,360
Farewell, my son.

394
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,390
A few days later,
I left for military school

395
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,209
where an exciting life awaited me.

396
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:25,489
I'm sorry, ladies,
we have no more coffee.

397
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:26,961
- What?
- Or milk.

398
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:31,042
- Is this a joke?
- Not at all, Madame.

399
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:35,523
Today has been unusually busy
so we're out of coffee and milk.

400
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:38,288
What will we drink then?

401
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,420
- You have verbena?
- No, I'm sorry.

402
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:43,818
We're also out of herbal tea.

403
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:45,886
Do you have water?

404
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:50,823
- Of course. It would be the last straw.
- Bring us water.

405
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:54,284
Incredible!

406
00:37:56,151 --> 00:38:00,281
Thank you for listening to me.
Allow me to take my leave.

407
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:02,051
Please do, Lieutenant.

408
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:03,343
And thanks.

409
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:06,356
My God! What was I thinking?

410
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:12,487
I have an appointment.
I must be off. Excuse me.

411
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:18,038
- We'll get together one of these days.
- Indeed. Goodbye, Simone.

412
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:45,374
Sorry I'm late, darling.

413
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:47,716
Not all that late.

414
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:51,056
- Champagne?
- With pleasure.

415
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:52,902
Afterwards.

416
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:08,742
Get undressed, quick.

417
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:12,777
- Turn off the light first.
- Why?

418
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:14,948
Because I'm not cured yet.

419
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:16,483
What?

420
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:19,335
But your hands look fine.

421
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:21,316
Not my hands, but elsewhere.

422
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:23,857
God! lf you saw it...

423
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:26,609
In that case...

424
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,540
This dress is such a nuisance.

425
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:43,541
Turn off the light!

426
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:52,577
Hear that?

427
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:58,737
I don't know who it is.

428
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:14,863
Oh, it's you!
Good. Come in.

429
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,800
What do you want?

430
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,179
I saw Senechal this morning.

431
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:37,101
He's sorry about lunch the other day.
"A misunderstanding."

432
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:40,392
- He wants to have us over tonight.
- Tonight?

433
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:41,301
Who is it?

434
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:43,349
Your husband.

435
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:47,131
Is that my wife in your bedroom?

436
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:49,172
She arrived five minutes ago.

437
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,330
That's odd.

438
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:56,777
She said nothing?

439
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:58,608
Isn't this a coincidence!

440
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,600
I also came by
to give him the invitation.

441
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:06,189
- You free tonight?
- Absolutely.

442
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:09,320
- So we go together, as usual?
- With pleasure.

443
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:12,073
- Some champagne?
- No, I must run along.

444
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:13,174
Coming with me?

445
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:18,982
No, wait. Let her stay a moment.
Just a few minutes.

446
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:22,943
- What for?
- I have to show her the sursicks.

447
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,140
- The what?
- The sursicks.

448
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:29,239
- I'll wait in the car.
- I'll be right down.

449
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,809
- What are these sursicks?
- I don't know and who cares!

450
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:40,620
Come quick!

451
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:44,939
You're mad! He's downstairs!
He might come back up!

452
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,570
Just one little moment!

453
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:49,019
Leave me alone! Let me go!

454
00:42:58,453 --> 00:43:00,203
See you tonight, darling.

455
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:24,223
Don't move. Hands up.

456
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:32,038
Where is your arm?

457
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:39,329
You're better qualified
for love than for war.

458
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:56,318
You think I'm a bastard.

459
00:44:56,697 --> 00:45:00,657
I'd even be a socialist,
if socialists believed in God.

460
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:02,953
How old are you?

461
00:45:10,669 --> 00:45:13,459
You and your friends
haven't a chance.

462
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:17,551
Violence will get you nowhere.
I've always said so.

463
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:21,627
You're a good little housewife.
Bread, lettuce...

464
00:45:23,182 --> 00:45:24,632
The key to dreams...

465
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:37,114
A man forewarned is forearmed,
don't you think?

466
00:45:38,322 --> 00:45:39,372
Some champagne?

467
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:45,429
Have any younger brothers?

468
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:56,523
Basically, we think alike.

469
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,030
Take the bomb and pollution.

470
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:03,062
You're against.
Well, so am l.

471
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:05,638
You're for free love. So am l.

472
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:10,298
How dare you touch me!
Mao Tse-tung was right...

473
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:13,439
Takich ajdakw jak Pan
naley tpi bezlitonie!

474
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,530
I don't agree.

475
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:18,976
If Mao said that,
it means he misread Freud.

476
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,440
When all is said and done,

477
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:26,926
the only solution to famine and
poverty is the military solution.

478
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:29,741
You'll see in Miranda,

479
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:34,913
when you have to spread your
pretty thighs to an infantry battalion.

480
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:36,547
Don't you agree?

481
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:40,763
And now?

482
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:43,562
Yours must be loaded,

483
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:46,778
since you're here to kill me.

484
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:50,431
I could easily eliminate you.
Self-defense.

485
00:46:52,104 --> 00:46:55,114
But I'll show you
how generous I can be.

486
00:46:55,357 --> 00:46:57,267
The door is open. Get out.

487
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:04,817
I have a dinner appointment.
I must get dressed. Get out!

488
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:21,609
- So you don't know the IWM?
- I'm not much on acronyms.

489
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:24,070
The lnternational Women's
Movement.

490
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,951
You know the IWM's rallying sign?

491
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:27,933
This.

492
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:32,036
As idiotic a sign as the others.

493
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:33,917
Fascist. Communist. Victory,

494
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:38,000
and "Christ is our lord and master."

495
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:39,871
And "Morituri te salutant."

496
00:48:39,962 --> 00:48:42,112
Rafael, can you come a minute?

497
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:50,387
May I introduce Don Rafael Acosta,
ambassador of the Mirandan Republic.

498
00:48:50,556 --> 00:48:51,726
Monsignor Dufour.

499
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:54,392
- Your Grace.
- Your Excellency.

500
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:58,243
Dinner will be served shortly.
A drink, while we wait?

501
00:48:59,189 --> 00:49:03,549
Just this once, I'll have a whiskey.
Just a drop. With soda.

502
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:05,762
Nothing for me, thank you.

503
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:08,273
I'm delighted to meet you.

504
00:49:08,782 --> 00:49:11,982
You know, we have
a large mission in Bogota.

505
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,273
Bogota is in Colombia.

506
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:18,370
That's right, it is in Colombia.
I got mixed up.

507
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:23,171
I don't know Miranda but
I hear it's a magnificent country.

508
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:24,862
The Andes, the pampas...

509
00:49:25,883 --> 00:49:28,743
The pampas are in Argentina,
Your Grace.

510
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:32,638
You're right. Of course.
I ought to know that.

511
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,489
I recently saw a book
on Latin America.

512
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:40,289
It had superb photos
of your ancient pyramids.

513
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:41,369
Our pyramids?

514
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,318
We have no pyramids in Miranda.

515
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:48,289
Mexico and Guatemala have them,
we don't.

516
00:49:48,906 --> 00:49:51,306
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely sure.

517
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:54,600
Dinner is ready, Madame.

518
00:49:57,623 --> 00:49:58,663
If you please,

519
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,511
dinner is served.

520
00:50:31,323 --> 00:50:34,373
- Your Grace...
- After you, Madame, please.

521
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:38,232
- Will you do the honors?
- If you insist.

522
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:49,131
Who can that be at this hour?

523
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:51,172
Rosalie, please get the door.

524
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:09,569
Ladies, gentlemen, good evening...

525
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,790
Please excuse us.

526
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:14,946
I was expecting you tomorrow.

527
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:17,809
Maneuvers were moved up a day.

528
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:20,606
But, Colonel, turning up like this...

529
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:24,125
I'm truly sorry.
It's not my fault, believe me.

530
00:51:24,126 --> 00:51:25,756
We have guests tonight.

531
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,713
I suppose you haven't had dinner.

532
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:32,008
Give me 5 minutes
and I'll see what I can do.

533
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:36,429
In the meantime, won't you have
a drink and meet our friends?

534
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:37,420
With pleasure.

535
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:41,523
Can you help with the chairs?

536
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:43,959
At your service, Madame.

537
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,129
Let's see what's in the fridge.

538
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:56,060
Some pate, some ham...

539
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:03,289
Care for a whiskey?
Dry martini? Vodka?

540
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,570
Whatever you like.

541
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,357
- A martini?
- Why not?

542
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:13,049
Mr. Senechal had agreed to house
us during maneuvers, like before.

543
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:16,010
I didn't think he'd have
guests tonight.

544
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:18,279
- Mexican?
- Congo.

545
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:19,991
Good stuff.

546
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,599
You're an infantry officer?

547
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,180
- Cavalry.
- So sorry.

548
00:52:24,853 --> 00:52:28,773
- What's that you're smoking, Colonel?
- Marijuana. Care for some?

549
00:52:28,774 --> 00:52:29,814
No, thank you.

550
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,609
- Your Excellency?
- Certainly not.

551
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:32,700
I'd love some.

552
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:49,430
Not those chairs!

553
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:51,668
I'll go get some others.

554
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:55,860
Your Grace!

555
00:52:57,427 --> 00:52:58,287
That'll do.

556
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:06,089
I wouldn't have believed
you smoked in the army.

557
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:10,193
In my country, for example,
the army is incredibly strict.

558
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:12,791
Marijuana's nothing, you know.

559
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:17,488
But it's the first step towards
worse. I loathe drug addicts.

560
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:18,169
So do l.

561
00:53:19,116 --> 00:53:22,206
6,000 U.S. Marines
were discharged recently

562
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,280
because they were drug addicts.

563
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,479
That's kind of you.

564
00:53:30,169 --> 00:53:33,789
Marijuana isn't a drug.
Take Vietnam, for instance.

565
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,390
From generals to privates,
everybody smokes.

566
00:53:38,468 --> 00:53:41,678
And what happens?
They bomb their own troops.

567
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:45,979
If they bomb their own troop,
there must be a reason.

568
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,070
And remember, during
the Great War,

569
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:52,482
our men had to drink
3 liters of wine a day.

570
00:53:52,483 --> 00:53:53,533
You exaggerate.

571
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:58,988
Not at all. Despite those 3 liters
there were still many deserters.

572
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:01,969
They were machine-gunned
by French police.

573
00:54:02,242 --> 00:54:03,702
Hundreds were killed.

574
00:54:04,161 --> 00:54:05,536
I never heard that.

575
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:09,290
It's a historic fact. They even
say it happened at Verdun...

576
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:11,021
I think we can eat now.

577
00:54:11,793 --> 00:54:13,933
I hope we can all squeeze in.

578
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:17,679
Obviously, the portions are small.

579
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:21,069
But there are eggs,
ham and cheese.

580
00:54:21,803 --> 00:54:25,389
I'm sure it will be fine.
And again, my apologies.

581
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:26,720
Sit where you can.

582
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:43,032
- Some foie gras, Colonel?
- With pleasure.

583
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:45,303
- May I serve you?
- Please do.

584
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:49,934
- Are your maneuvers long?
- About a week.

585
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:53,017
And your wife didn't came with you?

586
00:54:53,168 --> 00:54:55,438
Message from HQ for the Colonel.

587
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:04,931
Sir...

588
00:55:05,556 --> 00:55:06,706
What is it now?

589
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:08,719
If you'll excuse me...

590
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:14,897
- You don't say!
- What is it?

591
00:55:14,898 --> 00:55:17,918
The Green Army's attacked.
We have to go.

592
00:55:17,943 --> 00:55:19,563
But you haven't eaten!

593
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:22,581
I'm sorry, Madame,
but orders are orders.

594
00:55:22,656 --> 00:55:24,006
Ladies, gentlemen...

595
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:26,909
Gentlemen, we're leaving.

596
00:55:30,956 --> 00:55:32,346
Ah, that's right...

597
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:35,733
The sergeant has
a charming dream to relate.

598
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:40,958
We're listening.

599
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:45,879
I had a dream last week...

600
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:50,964
I was taking a walk at dusk
in a busy shopping street.

601
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:14,124
What are you doing around here?

602
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:15,516
What about you?

603
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,380
I live here.

604
00:56:18,337 --> 00:56:19,147
Since when?

605
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:23,730
It's been six years, I think.

606
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:25,140
And you?

607
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:27,179
I just got here.

608
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:37,773
What's the matter?
You look so pale.

609
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:40,496
And you?
You should see yourself.

610
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:43,526
- You smell of earth.
- So do you.

611
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:46,348
Are you staying here long?

612
00:56:46,657 --> 00:56:47,237
Forever.

613
00:57:00,254 --> 00:57:01,814
Wait for me a minute.

614
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:04,131
I have to buy something.

615
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:04,932
I'll wait.

616
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:10,181
Hello.

617
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:15,356
- Wasn't Ramirez just here with you?
- Yes.

618
00:57:17,646 --> 00:57:19,856
- You sure it was him?
- Sure.

619
00:57:20,607 --> 00:57:23,617
Don't you know
he died over 6 years ago?

620
00:57:24,736 --> 00:57:26,996
Say, that's true. You're right.

621
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:30,581
- How can that be?
- I don't know.

622
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:34,789
I was surprised to see him.
He said he lived around here.

623
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:39,161
I remember now,
he died quite a while ago.

624
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:42,159
He went in here.
Wait, I'll go get him.

625
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,639
- It's you?
- Yes, it's me.

626
00:57:58,604 --> 00:58:02,148
- You recognize me?
- How could I not recognize you?

627
00:58:02,149 --> 00:58:05,249
- You might have forgotten me.
- Forget you?

628
00:58:10,491 --> 00:58:12,950
Every time I tried to talk to you,

629
00:58:12,951 --> 00:58:15,751
you kept your distance,
you snubbed me.

630
00:58:16,997 --> 00:58:18,757
- Remember?
- I remember.

631
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:25,164
Last time, you returned to the sand.
Now you're here, coming to me.

632
00:58:26,298 --> 00:58:27,338
Why this late?

633
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:31,352
I don't know.
I wanted to see you again.

634
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:34,080
I looked for you in this dark crowd.

635
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:36,913
I've been looking since I arrived.

636
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:40,369
- Nothing will part us again.
- Nothing.

637
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,670
Just 3 minutes ago,
I ran into an old friend.

638
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:52,828
Wait, I'll get him.
You must meet him.

639
00:58:52,908 --> 00:58:53,708
I'll wait.

640
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:14,467
Ramirez!

641
00:59:39,288 --> 00:59:40,858
Where are you, Mother?

642
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:46,049
I seek you among the shadows.

643
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:51,277
Mother?

644
00:59:58,932 --> 01:00:01,422
I went off in search of my mother,

645
01:00:02,227 --> 01:00:04,312
but the street was
full of shadows

646
01:00:04,313 --> 01:00:05,823
and no one responded.

647
01:00:10,569 --> 01:00:12,599
Now tell us the train dream.

648
01:00:14,573 --> 01:00:17,363
No, we have to hurry.
Some other time.

649
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:18,911
Let's get going.

650
01:00:20,204 --> 01:00:21,724
My respects, Madame...

651
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,180
Ladies, gentlemen...

652
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:13,858
When Lazarus rose from the
dead, he had no memories.

653
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:24,687
What's that?

654
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:29,680
It's the beginning of maneuvers.
I hope they spare the house.

655
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:35,481
I'll make some coffee.

656
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:44,748
Hello.

657
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:46,629
It's me again.

658
01:01:49,293 --> 01:01:50,803
Please, don't bother.

659
01:01:51,712 --> 01:01:53,921
I hope the noise
isn't disturbing.

660
01:01:53,922 --> 01:01:55,756
Not at all. It's perfectly normal.

661
01:01:55,757 --> 01:02:00,367
It's an artillery barrage. The
cavalry will attack in 20 minutes.

662
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:00,897
I see.

663
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:03,689
Mrs. Senechal's not here?

664
01:02:05,184 --> 01:02:08,024
Ah, it's you.
You'll have some coffee?

665
01:02:08,479 --> 01:02:12,648
Thank you, there's no time. I simply
wanted to extend my apologies,

666
01:02:12,649 --> 01:02:15,735
and I'd be delighted if you,
and your friends, of course,

667
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:19,447
would come to my home for dinner.
Would next Friday do?

668
01:02:19,448 --> 01:02:21,078
Maneuvers will be over.

669
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:23,919
If my friends accept.

670
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:29,332
Fine. Your Grace will honor me
with his presence?

671
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:30,791
The honor's all mine.

672
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:32,126
Until Friday, then.

673
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:34,917
My wife will be
delighted to meet you.

674
01:02:37,382 --> 01:02:38,422
Our address is

675
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:40,412
1 7, rue du Parc.

676
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:28,218
They'll be right down.

677
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:45,118
"Hat worn by Napoleon
at the Battle of Wagram".

678
01:03:45,868 --> 01:03:47,188
Let me try it on.

679
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,248
Not quite.
It's too small.

680
01:03:52,249 --> 01:03:54,619
But it seems to be made for you.

681
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:57,040
Come now, Henri,
such bad taste!

682
01:03:57,129 --> 01:03:59,589
What did I say?
It suits you fine.

683
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,090
You're such a child!

684
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,240
- Some more?
- No, thank you.

685
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:12,029
Add some seltzer.

686
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:14,182
Your health!

687
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:20,353
Is this whiskey?

688
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:22,278
That's what the label says.

689
01:04:22,279 --> 01:04:23,738
Tastes like Quasi-Cola.

690
01:04:23,739 --> 01:04:25,009
It is Quasi-Cola.

691
01:04:25,449 --> 01:04:29,739
If the Colonel's meal is like
his drinks, we're in for it.

692
01:05:01,819 --> 01:05:02,969
Is this a joke?

693
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:32,140
"And to prove your valor,

694
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:35,471
"you invite the Commander's
specter to dinner!"

695
01:05:35,936 --> 01:05:37,676
And to prove your valor,

696
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:39,660
you invite...

697
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:57,672
"And to make us believe
he attended..."

698
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:00,168
God, what am I doing here?

699
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:03,139
"... You put us to sleep with a narcotic."

700
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:07,719
I don't know my lines!

701
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:30,820
What's the matter?

702
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,070
Oh, nothing,

703
01:06:32,826 --> 01:06:33,866
a crazy dream.

704
01:06:34,912 --> 01:06:38,456
We were at the Colonel's
and we ended up on a stage,

705
01:06:38,457 --> 01:06:38,797
And?

706
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:50,076
What?

707
01:06:50,677 --> 01:06:54,627
Where are you? We're waiting
for you at the Colonel's.

708
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:58,249
We were afraid
something happened.

709
01:06:58,268 --> 01:07:00,878
No, we're coming.
I just dozed off.

710
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:02,591
We're on our way.

711
01:07:10,322 --> 01:07:11,942
How do I look, Rafael?

712
01:07:12,366 --> 01:07:12,946
Ghastly.

713
01:07:13,867 --> 01:07:16,077
It's a slightly effeminate hat.

714
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:19,668
Napoleon? You think so?

715
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:24,001
As for Napoleon's hat at Wagram,
I've seen three in France.

716
01:07:24,002 --> 01:07:25,092
You don't say!

717
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:28,128
Another whiskey,
Your Excellency?

718
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:36,636
- More port?
- No, thank you, I haven't finished.

719
01:07:45,566 --> 01:07:47,956
What a pleasure.
We were worried.

720
01:07:48,277 --> 01:07:49,902
My respects, Madame.
It's all my fault.

721
01:07:49,903 --> 01:07:53,223
Do come and sit down.
Will you have something?

722
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:56,742
With your permission, a scotch.

723
01:07:56,743 --> 01:07:59,363
- And you, Madame?
- A drop of port.

724
01:08:05,419 --> 01:08:08,259
I hope you like it,
it's vintage port.

725
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:19,960
Any news from Miranda?

726
01:08:20,184 --> 01:08:22,310
- How is the situation?
- Quite calm.

727
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:23,651
And the guerrillas?

728
01:08:24,188 --> 01:08:27,857
There are a few left.
They're part of our folklore.

729
01:08:27,858 --> 01:08:29,898
You have some student unrest.

730
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,696
Students are young.
They need to have some fun.

731
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:36,027
What is your government's policy?

732
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:41,082
We're not anti-student, you know.

733
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,960
On the contrary. But what do you do if
your room's swarming with flies?

734
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:50,231
You take a swatter and... splat!

735
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:51,879
No more flies!

736
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:54,021
One moment...

737
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:58,800
I hear your country is beautiful.

738
01:08:58,972 --> 01:09:00,022
Very beautiful.

739
01:09:00,557 --> 01:09:03,059
Of course, you lack
caviar and champagne.

740
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:06,490
But we have things just
as fine, if not better.

741
01:09:08,398 --> 01:09:09,148
Excuse me.

742
01:09:17,908 --> 01:09:22,578
Is it true that in certain parts of
Miranda there's still dire poverty?

743
01:09:22,579 --> 01:09:27,479
I can hardly believe the gulf
between rich and poor is growing wider.

744
01:09:28,377 --> 01:09:29,767
You've been misled.

745
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:33,750
Our economy is booming,
as the statistics show.

746
01:09:35,342 --> 01:09:36,092
Excuse me.

747
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:46,099
Excuse me, Your Excellency.
I heard you just now.

748
01:09:46,687 --> 01:09:49,939
I'm deeply interested
in administrative problems.

749
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:51,970
What would you like to know?

750
01:09:52,651 --> 01:09:56,561
I'm told your judges and
policemen often accept bribes.

751
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:03,907
In the past, perhaps. There
were instances, as everywhere.

752
01:10:03,912 --> 01:10:08,232
But we are a true democracy now.
Corruption no longer exists.

753
01:10:09,209 --> 01:10:09,959
Excuse me.

754
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:19,047
I don't think I belong here.

755
01:10:20,596 --> 01:10:22,816
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

756
01:10:23,432 --> 01:10:26,522
I'll tell you another time.
Until tomorrow.

757
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:38,389
Your Excellency!

758
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:44,539
- Leaving already?
- Not at all. Why?

759
01:10:44,953 --> 01:10:47,683
My husband would like
to talk to you.

760
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:50,812
I'd like to drink a toast to you.

761
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:52,498
With pleasure, Colonel.

762
01:10:59,426 --> 01:11:00,526
To your health!

763
01:11:05,224 --> 01:11:09,124
Your country's been in the news
lately, at least here.

764
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:13,509
I read that Miranda
holds the world record

765
01:11:13,649 --> 01:11:16,359
for the number of homicides
per capita.

766
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,400
No, Colonel, you're mistaken.

767
01:11:19,196 --> 01:11:22,856
Hardly. It seems people kill
at the drop of a hat.

768
01:11:22,908 --> 01:11:24,708
At least 30 deaths daily.

769
01:11:24,868 --> 01:11:28,358
No, Colonel. I think you're
trying to offend me.

770
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:32,127
Not at all. I know
what I'm talking about.

771
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:35,218
I read it in a very serious report.

772
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,715
Allow me not to take
your word for it.

773
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:42,676
I repeat, I know what
I'm talking about.

774
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:46,801
If I weren't your guest,
I would demand satisfaction.

775
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:53,240
I wasn't aware this chivalrous custom
existed in your semi-barbaric land.

776
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:58,479
You have just insulted
the Republic of Miranda.

777
01:11:59,403 --> 01:12:02,773
I couldn't give a tinker's damn
about Miranda.

778
01:12:03,323 --> 01:12:05,583
And I shit on your entire army.

779
01:12:17,629 --> 01:12:19,797
What is it?
I didn't hear anything.

780
01:12:19,798 --> 01:12:21,668
Calm down, Colonel, please!

781
01:12:22,009 --> 01:12:23,939
The ambassador's charming...

782
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:25,970
He's a lout who deserved it!

783
01:12:25,971 --> 01:12:27,638
There's been a mix-up!

784
01:12:27,639 --> 01:12:31,079
Let's calm down, Colonel.
Tell us what happened.

785
01:12:31,977 --> 01:12:33,027
Nothing tragic.

786
01:12:34,062 --> 01:12:34,812
Excuse me.

787
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:55,120
What's the matter?

788
01:12:57,169 --> 01:12:58,559
I dreamed that l...

789
01:13:01,256 --> 01:13:03,886
First I dreamed
that Senechal dreamed

790
01:13:04,176 --> 01:13:06,206
that we went to a theater...

791
01:13:06,678 --> 01:13:09,878
Then, that we were invited
to the Colonel's,

792
01:13:10,849 --> 01:13:13,179
and that he argued with Rafael...

793
01:13:13,936 --> 01:13:16,426
You're a goose.
Go back to sleep.

794
01:13:17,856 --> 01:13:19,306
Calm down and sleep.

795
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:45,067
What flowers! The garden's
never looked lovelier.

796
01:14:45,068 --> 01:14:47,608
That's kind of you.
I do my best.

797
01:14:47,779 --> 01:14:48,639
By the way,

798
01:14:49,656 --> 01:14:52,626
we're having some friends
over for lunch.

799
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:57,038
- Won't you join us?
- I'd love to, but I must finish.

800
01:14:57,039 --> 01:14:59,069
It would make me very happy.

801
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:01,136
And we'll be among friends.

802
01:15:02,211 --> 01:15:03,891
Just come when you can.

803
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:07,781
I'll finish what I have to do,
then join you.

804
01:15:08,842 --> 01:15:13,102
May I suggest flanking the gate
with two rows of hydrangeas?

805
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,790
May I show you?

806
01:15:21,814 --> 01:15:26,064
We plant two rows of hydrangeas
from the gate to the house.

807
01:15:30,489 --> 01:15:31,639
May I help you?

808
01:15:31,824 --> 01:15:33,734
Where can I find a priest?

809
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,599
You have to inquire at the parish.

810
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:39,257
But, Madame, I am a priest!

811
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:46,040
- Why do you need him?
- To give absolution to a dying old man.

812
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,580
Wait here. I'll be right back.

813
01:15:48,799 --> 01:15:49,599
Who is it?

814
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:53,901
He's a very old man
and very poor.

815
01:15:54,096 --> 01:15:57,356
He lives on a farm nearby.
A former gardener.

816
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:01,847
- He's very sick now.
- He needs a doctor.

817
01:16:01,937 --> 01:16:03,607
He says it's too late.

818
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:05,769
He wants a priest.

819
01:16:06,150 --> 01:16:06,900
Wait here.

820
01:16:45,272 --> 01:16:45,912
Father...

821
01:16:48,192 --> 01:16:50,282
I want to tell you something.

822
01:16:50,569 --> 01:16:52,079
Then speak, my child.

823
01:16:52,362 --> 01:16:54,742
I really don't like Jesus Christ.

824
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:59,060
Even as a little girl,
I hated him.

825
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,860
Such a good, gentle God?

826
01:17:04,249 --> 01:17:05,639
How is it possible?

827
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:07,062
Want to know why?

828
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:13,299
Let me tend to this sick man
first, then we'll talk.

829
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:17,890
I have to deliver two bags of
carrots. I'll come for you after.

830
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:44,629
You asked for a priest?
Here I am.

831
01:17:45,499 --> 01:17:49,519
I bring you the solace of
religion. You wish to confess?

832
01:17:49,586 --> 01:17:50,636
Yes, confess...

833
01:17:51,964 --> 01:17:53,004
I'm listening.

834
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:55,379
Tell me your sins.

835
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:56,649
Father...

836
01:17:57,553 --> 01:18:00,113
Many years ago I committed
a crime.

837
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:02,409
I killed a man and a woman.

838
01:18:03,809 --> 01:18:05,389
- Who?
- My employers.

839
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,910
I killed them both.

840
01:18:08,438 --> 01:18:10,358
They treated me so harshly.

841
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:13,793
There, on the photo...
That's them.

842
01:18:15,779 --> 01:18:16,699
Him and her.

843
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:20,407
The man behind them
with the rake is me.

844
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,390
I was a gardener.

845
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:26,780
Years and years ago.

846
01:18:30,294 --> 01:18:32,264
Do you know the little boy?

847
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:34,082
Yes, that's their son.

848
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:36,610
Yes. That was me.

849
01:18:38,969 --> 01:18:41,759
I remember this photo.
I often saw it.

850
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:45,530
Those you killed were
my parents.

851
01:18:47,519 --> 01:18:49,559
They never found the culprit.

852
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:53,700
It was me.

853
01:18:55,152 --> 01:18:57,362
They treated me like an animal.

854
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,190
He was a brute, and she...

855
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:03,409
Calm down.

856
01:19:07,206 --> 01:19:10,458
You want absolution
before you meet your maker?

857
01:19:10,459 --> 01:19:12,309
Oh, yes, for pity's sake.

858
01:19:12,669 --> 01:19:15,769
The Lord forgives
the most hardened sinners.

859
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:20,729
See the example he gives us
by uniting us here.

860
01:19:21,678 --> 01:19:24,308
Close your eyes,
gather your thoughts

861
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:25,830
and pray.

862
01:19:27,518 --> 01:19:30,258
May our Lord Jesus Christ
forgive you.

863
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:34,009
And l, by His authority,
pardon your sins,

864
01:19:35,067 --> 01:19:39,427
in the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

865
01:19:46,078 --> 01:19:47,348
Go in peace, now.

866
01:20:42,009 --> 01:20:45,511
Will you have a drink,
or shall we eat right away?

867
01:20:45,512 --> 01:20:47,132
I'm starving to death.

868
01:20:47,181 --> 01:20:48,811
Take your places, then.

869
01:20:49,558 --> 01:20:51,188
We have truffle omelet,

870
01:20:52,352 --> 01:20:54,272
and guinea fowl with morel.

871
01:20:55,147 --> 01:20:56,887
You can serve now, lnes.

872
01:20:58,358 --> 01:21:01,668
His Grace was called away
to see a dying man.

873
01:21:01,778 --> 01:21:03,698
Maybe we should wait, then?

874
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:06,079
He said to start without him.

875
01:21:07,743 --> 01:21:09,952
Have you made plans
for the summer?

876
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:11,463
Neither have we. Why?

877
01:21:13,499 --> 01:21:15,529
Why not come out to Miranda?

878
01:21:16,877 --> 01:21:21,187
It's an invitation. This way
you can learn about my country.

879
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:25,381
It must be terribly hot
in the summer.

880
01:21:25,969 --> 01:21:30,159
When its summer here, it's winter
there. Isn't that right?

881
01:21:31,058 --> 01:21:31,758
Naturally.

882
01:21:32,142 --> 01:21:34,712
We French are hopeless
in geography.

883
01:21:37,356 --> 01:21:40,376
Get the door, lnes.
It must be His Grace.

884
01:21:41,652 --> 01:21:45,552
Rafael, rumor has it that
you're to be named minister.

885
01:21:45,697 --> 01:21:46,857
Police, open up!

886
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:50,639
In the name of the law!

887
01:21:58,418 --> 01:21:59,408
Rafael Acosta?

888
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:06,480
Inspector Delecluze. You are
the Mirandan Ambassador?

889
01:22:07,511 --> 01:22:08,311
Yes, I am.

890
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:10,129
You're under arrest.

891
01:22:11,181 --> 01:22:13,683
- You're under arrest.
- You've no right.

892
01:22:13,684 --> 01:22:18,174
I have every right. You're not on
Embassy grounds. The warrant.

893
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:19,870
And diplomatic immunity?

894
01:22:20,149 --> 01:22:23,889
Diplomatic immunity? The hell
with it! Take him away.

895
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:28,279
There must be some mistake.
The Ambassador can't possibly...

896
01:22:28,949 --> 01:22:31,109
- Henri Senechal?
- That's me.

897
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:32,860
You're under arrest.

898
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:36,330
This arrest is an outrage.
I'm calling my lawyer.

899
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:38,591
No, you're not!
Take him away!

900
01:22:39,459 --> 01:22:41,329
You're lnspector Delecluze?

901
01:22:42,087 --> 01:22:44,657
What a coincidence!
We're neighbors.

902
01:22:45,299 --> 01:22:47,399
I know your charming daughter.

903
01:22:47,926 --> 01:22:50,846
Are you Francois Thevenot,
by any chance?

904
01:22:51,221 --> 01:22:52,671
You're under arrest.

905
01:22:53,932 --> 01:22:58,182
- What are we accused of?
- You'll find out at the station.

906
01:22:59,313 --> 01:23:01,898
You can't arrest people
just like that!

907
01:23:01,899 --> 01:23:04,169
The women, too!
Take them away!

908
01:23:05,444 --> 01:23:06,594
Don't touch me!

909
01:23:08,614 --> 01:23:09,644
Let go of me!

910
01:23:14,953 --> 01:23:16,283
Are you a cyclist?

911
01:23:16,371 --> 01:23:17,521
Don't touch me!

912
01:23:18,749 --> 01:23:22,089
Search the house: bedrooms,
basement, the works!

913
01:23:44,691 --> 01:23:48,541
- What is it?
- Drug case. Some big players, it seems.

914
01:23:56,286 --> 01:23:57,556
Where's the fire?

915
01:23:58,121 --> 01:24:00,801
- Christ! What's the date?
- June 14.

916
01:24:00,999 --> 01:24:03,709
I totally forgot!
You're obviously new here.

917
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:04,400
How come?

918
01:24:05,212 --> 01:24:08,132
- June 14 is Bloody Sergeant Day.
- What?

919
01:24:08,382 --> 01:24:10,832
Never hear of the
Bloody Sergeant?

920
01:24:11,009 --> 01:24:11,759
No, never.

921
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:14,967
Listen good.
This was back in the days

922
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:19,090
when the police tried hard
to improve its public image.

923
01:24:19,268 --> 01:24:19,908
Remember?

924
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:20,940
Sure do.

925
01:24:26,233 --> 01:24:28,273
Have you phoned the Minister?

926
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:30,069
What about my lawyer?

927
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:32,520
- I'm thirsty!
- This is shameful.

928
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:37,869
- You staying?
- Just a little while.

929
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:41,940
- It's June 14, don't forget.
- I'm not forgetting, sir.

930
01:24:45,627 --> 01:24:46,957
As I was saying...

931
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:52,031
There was this sergeant
who was so strict...

932
01:24:52,759 --> 01:24:54,679
That's his picture there...

933
01:24:54,887 --> 01:24:56,807
he ruined our best efforts.

934
01:24:57,973 --> 01:24:59,943
Still, he was a decent guy.

935
01:25:12,488 --> 01:25:12,888
So...

936
01:25:14,072 --> 01:25:15,342
still won't talk?

937
01:25:16,658 --> 01:25:18,398
Will you answer, or not?

938
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:25,708
So you won't answer.

939
01:25:34,259 --> 01:25:37,399
Listen good, I'll give you
one more chance.

940
01:25:37,846 --> 01:25:39,466
Will you talk, or not?

941
01:25:42,142 --> 01:25:42,882
Go to it.

942
01:25:43,644 --> 01:25:46,024
- So, how's the missus?
- So-so.

943
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:50,608
- Will it be a boy or a girl?
- A girl, I hope. I have two boys.

944
01:25:50,609 --> 01:25:51,589
None of that!

945
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:00,588
I know you didn't plant the bomb.

946
01:26:00,786 --> 01:26:03,955
You're a nice fellow,
you have healthy ideas.

947
01:26:03,956 --> 01:26:08,606
But you know who did it. Talk
and you'll see your girl tomorrow.

948
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:11,261
I don't have a girl.

949
01:26:11,922 --> 01:26:14,182
You enjoy taking me for a ride?

950
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:16,449
Tough luck.
You asked for it.

951
01:26:16,718 --> 01:26:18,978
We'll make him play some piano.

952
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:41,330
We won't kill you.

953
01:26:55,299 --> 01:26:56,339
Will you talk?

954
01:26:58,010 --> 01:26:59,520
Still nothing to say?

955
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:13,820
Then, one June 14, he was
murdered during a demonstration.

956
01:27:14,318 --> 01:27:18,288
Since then, every June 14,
he returns to redeem himself.

957
01:27:18,739 --> 01:27:21,115
- He's coming tonight?
- For sure.

958
01:27:21,116 --> 01:27:24,952
Stay if you like, but I don't
want to meet the sergeant.

959
01:27:24,953 --> 01:27:26,463
Me, neither. Wait up!

960
01:28:50,622 --> 01:28:51,022
Stop!

961
01:28:52,666 --> 01:28:54,456
Don't let them get away!

962
01:28:57,838 --> 01:28:59,518
What's the matter, sir?

963
01:29:02,509 --> 01:29:03,249
It's you!

964
01:29:04,761 --> 01:29:07,138
I was washing up.
I heard you call.

965
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:10,879
Imagine, I dreamed you were
letting the prisoners go.

966
01:29:12,019 --> 01:29:12,299
Me?

967
01:29:14,188 --> 01:29:16,918
You had a face like
a slaughtered ox.

968
01:29:18,317 --> 01:29:20,127
Dreams can sometimes be...

969
01:29:27,242 --> 01:29:28,282
Hold the line.

970
01:29:28,869 --> 01:29:31,489
It's for you:
the lnterior Minister.

971
01:29:39,963 --> 01:29:40,603
Speaking.

972
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,470
Yes, ma'am, I'll wait.

973
01:29:49,223 --> 01:29:50,573
Inspector Delecluze?

974
01:29:51,517 --> 01:29:55,377
You arrested the Ambassador
of Miranda and his friends.

975
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,180
Release them immediately.

976
01:29:58,982 --> 01:30:02,532
But, sir, they've already
been booked. I can't...

977
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:06,523
Forget about the booking
and just do as I say.

978
01:30:08,242 --> 01:30:10,912
But, sir, can I at least know why...?

979
01:30:13,664 --> 01:30:16,834
Our diplomatic relations
with Latin America...

980
01:30:25,509 --> 01:30:28,119
What was that?
I couldn't hear you.

981
01:30:29,763 --> 01:30:32,673
What's that?
But I speak clearly enough.

982
01:30:42,651 --> 01:30:43,401
Very well.

983
01:30:44,653 --> 01:30:46,283
Yes, I understand, sir.

984
01:30:51,994 --> 01:30:52,634
Sergeant!

985
01:30:59,501 --> 01:31:01,021
Release the prisoners.

986
01:31:08,051 --> 01:31:09,211
Right away, sir.

987
01:31:33,952 --> 01:31:36,872
- You spoke to the Minister?
- Of course.

988
01:31:37,206 --> 01:31:40,696
I called to thank him.
I invited him to Miranda.

989
01:31:40,876 --> 01:31:43,486
- And?
- He'll do his best to come.

990
01:31:44,046 --> 01:31:45,256
What time is it?

991
01:31:45,839 --> 01:31:47,169
A quarter to nine.

992
01:31:47,549 --> 01:31:50,809
I hope they hurry,
the lamb will be overdone.

993
01:31:52,387 --> 01:31:54,997
- That must be them.
- I'll get it.

994
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:04,500
- Are we late?
- Not at all. How are you?

995
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,060
Fine, thank you.

996
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,790
Your dress is lovely.

997
01:32:16,829 --> 01:32:17,995
This is a real pleasure.

998
01:32:17,996 --> 01:32:19,206
For me, as well.

999
01:32:20,207 --> 01:32:22,197
Traffic was incredibly heavy.

1000
01:32:22,376 --> 01:32:25,711
- It's Saturday.
-True. I should have left earlier.

1001
01:32:25,712 --> 01:32:28,442
We passed at least
1 50-200 cyclists.

1002
01:32:29,049 --> 01:32:31,843
We'll skip cocktails
and get straight to dinner.

1003
01:32:31,844 --> 01:32:34,284
If not, the lamb will be overdone.

1004
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:36,590
Fine with me, I'm starved.

1005
01:32:40,811 --> 01:32:43,601
I've made some soup
with garden herbs.

1006
01:32:44,231 --> 01:32:45,501
A very good idea.

1007
01:32:45,566 --> 01:32:46,836
I made it myself.

1008
01:32:48,694 --> 01:32:51,604
Sit where you like
Francois on my right.

1009
01:32:52,489 --> 01:32:53,359
Rafael here.

1010
01:32:59,246 --> 01:33:02,206
I almost didn't make soup,
then I thought:

1011
01:33:02,207 --> 01:33:05,177
Is a dinner without soup
really a dinner?

1012
01:33:19,141 --> 01:33:22,171
So, lnes, how are things
with your fiance?

1013
01:33:22,311 --> 01:33:24,701
- We broke up, Madame.
- But why?

1014
01:33:26,148 --> 01:33:29,317
- He has 2 years in the army.
- You should wait.

1015
01:33:29,318 --> 01:33:32,820
It was his decision.
He says I'm too old as it is.

1016
01:33:32,821 --> 01:33:34,621
- How old are you?
- 52.

1017
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,656
Really? I see.

1018
01:33:36,783 --> 01:33:40,093
She worked for my parents
when I was a child.

1019
01:33:40,913 --> 01:33:44,233
Say, I read they arrested
a Nazi in Miranda...

1020
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:48,201
A Von Something-or-other,
who ran a concentration camp.

1021
01:33:48,504 --> 01:33:50,764
It seems he was a real butcher.

1022
01:33:52,466 --> 01:33:56,196
Calling him a butcher strikes
me as a bit excessive.

1023
01:33:56,512 --> 01:33:57,662
I met him once,

1024
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:01,889
and I can assure you,
he's a true gentleman.

1025
01:34:02,559 --> 01:34:05,561
It's compatible.
You can be poor and a thief.

1026
01:34:05,562 --> 01:34:07,652
And rich and honest, my dear.

1027
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:11,800
How did he dress, this
Mr. Von Something-or-other?

1028
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:14,946
Was he an animal-lover?

1029
01:34:14,947 --> 01:34:17,557
He would take walks
with a big dog.

1030
01:34:17,741 --> 01:34:20,881
Is it true there are
many Nazis in Miranda?

1031
01:34:21,662 --> 01:34:23,882
- How is the soup?
- Delicious.

1032
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:26,160
Feel free to add salt.

1033
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:28,953
I'm sure it's perfect, as usual.

1034
01:34:29,253 --> 01:34:31,563
I'll just go check on the lamb.

1035
01:34:40,139 --> 01:34:41,973
- What time is it?
- 9:1 0.

1036
01:34:41,974 --> 01:34:44,994
You can take it out.
25 minutes per pound

1037
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:46,160
is long enough.

1038
01:34:59,199 --> 01:34:59,599
Fine.

1039
01:35:17,259 --> 01:35:21,971
Few people know it, but you carve
a lamb standing. Right, Francois?

1040
01:35:21,972 --> 01:35:24,302
It's more proper.
Remember that.

1041
01:35:24,391 --> 01:35:25,961
Thanks for the lesson.

1042
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:28,520
What's your birth date, Rafael?

1043
01:35:28,604 --> 01:35:29,994
February 22, 1 920.

1044
01:35:32,232 --> 01:35:33,792
Then you're a Pisces?

1045
01:35:33,942 --> 01:35:35,232
Sagittarius rising.

1046
01:35:36,028 --> 01:35:37,570
That's very interesting.

1047
01:35:37,571 --> 01:35:39,731
- Shall I serve you?
- Please.

1048
01:35:42,409 --> 01:35:44,089
Pass me Rafael's plate.

1049
01:35:44,786 --> 01:35:46,196
Pisces-Sagittarius...

1050
01:35:47,789 --> 01:35:49,749
The union of these two signs

1051
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:52,270
enhances your strength
of character.

1052
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:58,150
You try to exceed
the limits of your ego.

1053
01:35:58,592 --> 01:35:59,572
You think so?

1054
01:36:01,053 --> 01:36:02,213
Some lima beans?

1055
01:36:03,138 --> 01:36:06,238
- Especially with olive oil.
- I added some.

1056
01:36:06,767 --> 01:36:07,687
Just for me.

1057
01:36:08,811 --> 01:36:09,801
With pleasure.

1058
01:36:10,646 --> 01:36:12,096
Your lamb is superb.

1059
01:36:12,439 --> 01:36:14,398
- Not overdone?
- Just right.

1060
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:17,089
You enjoy throwing
yourself into life.

1061
01:36:17,986 --> 01:36:21,846
You feel driven by great ideals
and noble undertakings.

1062
01:36:23,283 --> 01:36:26,893
Your open mind gives you
a global outlook on life.

1063
01:36:27,329 --> 01:36:31,869
You'll be my guests, next time.
Wait until you taste my caviar.

1064
01:36:33,418 --> 01:36:37,088
Florence will serve her
specialty: vodka and aquavit.

1065
01:36:37,089 --> 01:36:41,549
Your sensibility is in harmony with
your humanitarian conscience.

1066
01:36:44,012 --> 01:36:46,992
But if you want
to discard preconceptions,

1067
01:36:47,182 --> 01:36:51,502
you must replace them with a
personal code of ethics, Rafael.

1068
01:36:53,188 --> 01:36:56,278
I've always done as
my conscience dictates.

1069
01:36:56,608 --> 01:36:59,538
- Some more lamb, Rafael?
- With pleasure.

1070
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:02,321
- You prefer it rare?
- I don't care.

1071
01:37:02,322 --> 01:37:05,282
It's delicious.
I may be a bit perverse,

1072
01:37:05,492 --> 01:37:08,812
but I've a weakness
for American canned beans.

1073
01:37:21,884 --> 01:37:23,574
Everybody, on your feet!

1074
01:37:24,219 --> 01:37:25,729
Ladies, on your feet!

1075
01:37:27,639 --> 01:37:31,609
- What's the meaning of this?
- Hands behind your heads!

1076
01:37:31,768 --> 01:37:32,978
Get in the back!

1077
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:40,067
Give us a chance to explain.

1078
01:37:40,068 --> 01:37:41,458
You've been misled.

1079
01:37:41,612 --> 01:37:42,532
In the back!

1080
01:37:46,909 --> 01:37:47,539
Move it!

1081
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,770
When we've searched the house,

1082
01:37:51,997 --> 01:37:54,547
we'll have plenty
of time to talk.

1083
01:37:58,694 --> 01:38:00,544
What are you going to do?

1084
01:38:22,637 --> 01:38:23,037
Look!

1085
01:38:47,333 --> 01:38:48,893
Are you in pain, sir?

1086
01:38:51,363 --> 01:38:53,873
You screamed.
Do you need anything?

1087
01:38:54,463 --> 01:38:55,623
No, No, nothing.

1088
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:59,040
Go back to bed, go back to bed.
