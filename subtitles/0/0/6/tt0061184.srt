1
00:01:44,387 --> 00:01:47,618
- It's 2 o'clock in the morning.
- Oh, George!

2
00:01:47,824 --> 00:01:49,121
Well, it is.

3
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:52,287
What a cluck you are!

4
00:01:53,296 --> 00:01:54,957
It's late, you know. It's late.

5
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:18,096
What a dump!

6
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:23,606
Hey, what's that from? What a dump! 

7
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,778
How would I know?

8
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:28,944
Oh, come on, what's it from?
You know!

9
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:34,283
What's it from, for Christ's sake?

10
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:36,114
What's what from?

11
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,952
I just told you. I just did it.

12
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:42,287
What a dump! 

13
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:45,290
Huh? What's that from?

14
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:47,466
I haven't the faintest idea.

15
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:49,331
Dumbbell!

16
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:52,132
It's from some Bette Davis picture...

17
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:54,466
...some goddamn Warner Brothers epic.

18
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:58,804
Martha, I can't remember all the films
that came out of Warner Brothers.

19
00:04:59,148 --> 00:05:02,140
Nobody's asking you to remember
every Warner Brothers epic.

20
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:04,646
Just one single little epic.
That's all.

21
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:07,820
Bette Davis gets peritonitis at the end.

22
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:10,819
And she wears a fright wig
throughout the picture.

23
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,321
She's married to Joseph Cotten
or something.

24
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:14,652
Somebody.

25
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:20,333
She wants to go to Chicago because
she loves that actor with the scar.

26
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:22,096
She gets sick...

27
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:24,499
...and sits down at her dressing table...

28
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:26,331
What actor? What scar?

29
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:29,509
I can't remember his name!
What's the picture?

30
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:31,837
I want to know the name of the picture.

31
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:35,681
She gets this peritonitis...

32
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:39,849
...and decides to go to Chicago anyway.

33
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:42,514
Chicago! It's called Chicago.

34
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:46,352
What is?

35
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:49,764
I mean the picture. It's Chicago.

36
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,524
Oh, good grief!

37
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:55,197
Don't you know anything?

38
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,701
Chicago was a '30s musical...

39
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:02,534
...starring little Miss Alice Faye.
Don't you know anything?

40
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,869
This picture...

41
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:09,378
...Bette Davis comes home from
a hard day at the grocery store...

42
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,380
She works in a grocery store?

43
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:15,384
She's a housewife. She buys things.

44
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,050
She comes with the groceries...

45
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:22,391
...and she walks into
the modest living room...

46
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:26,566
...of the modest cottage
modest Joseph Cotten set her up in.

47
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:27,733
Are they married?

48
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:31,738
Yes, they're married.
To each other, cluck!

49
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:37,239
And she comes in
and she looks around this room...

50
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:41,076
...and she sets down her groceries.

51
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:42,911
And she says...

52
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:45,918
...What a dump! 

53
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:53,751
She's discontent.

54
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,423
What's the name of the picture?

55
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:00,758
I really don't know.

56
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:02,435
Well, think!

57
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:03,761
I'm tired, dear.

58
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:07,440
I don't know why you're tired.
You didn't do anything today.

59
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:09,574
- I'm tired.
- You didn't have classes.

60
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,613
If your father didn't always set up
these Saturday night orgies...

61
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,781
Well, it's just too bad about you.

62
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,780
Well, that's how it is anyway.

63
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:22,455
You didn't do anything. You never do.
You never mix!

64
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:24,453
You just sit around and talk.

65
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:29,287
What do you want me to do?
Bray at everyone all night like you do?

66
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:31,293
I don't bray!

67
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:33,625
All right, you don't bray.

68
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:36,127
I did not bray.

69
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:37,962
I said you didn't bray!

70
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:41,132
Fix me a drink.

71
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:43,805
Haven't you had enough?

72
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,812
I said fix me a drink!

73
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:52,815
Well, I don't suppose a nightcap
would kill either of us.

74
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,981
A nightcap? Are you kidding?

75
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,786
We've got guests.

76
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:01,756
Got what?

77
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,991
Guests. Guests!

78
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:13,331
Yeah, guests. People.
We've got guests coming over.

79
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:14,874
When?

80
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:16,867
Now.

81
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:20,179
Good Lord, Martha,
do you know what time it is?

82
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:23,349
Who's coming over?

83
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:25,779
- What's-their-name.
- Who?

84
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,152
Who's what's-their-name?

85
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:33,192
I don't know their name, George.

86
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:38,193
We met tonight. They're new. He's
in the math department or something.

87
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:41,025
I don't remember
meeting anybody tonight.

88
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:42,829
Well, you did.

89
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,872
Of all the asinine...
Who are these people?

90
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:49,042
He's in the Math Department.

91
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:50,109
Who?

92
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:55,210
He's in the Math Department.
He's young and he's blond...

93
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:57,546
He's good-looking, well-built?

94
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:00,378
Yes, good-looking, well-built.

95
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:03,715
- It figures.
- What?

96
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:05,052
Nothing.

97
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:09,053
His wife's a mousy little type
without any hips or anything.

98
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,388
Remember them now?

99
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:14,734
I guess so. But why do they
have to come over now?

100
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:18,040
Because Daddy said
we should be nice to them, that's why.

101
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:21,376
- Daddy said we should be nice to them.
- Why now...?

102
00:09:21,577 --> 00:09:24,239
Because Daddy said
we should be nice to them!

103
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,072
He didn't mean we were supposed
to stay up all night with them.

104
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:30,408
We could have them over
some Sunday.

105
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:33,085
Well, never mind.
Besides, it is Sunday.

106
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:36,088
Very early Sunday.

107
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:39,520
- It's ridiculous!
- Well, it's done.

108
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:08,951
Where are they?
If we've got guests, where are they?

109
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:10,782
They'll be here soon.

110
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:13,425
What'd they do, go home
and get some sleep first?

111
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:16,288
They'll be here.

112
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:17,864
I wish you'd tell me...

113
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,160
...about things. Stop springing
things on me all the time.

114
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:24,333
I don't spring things
on you all the time.

115
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,303
You really do! You're always
springing things on me.

116
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:30,442
Always.

117
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,114
Poor Georgie Porgie put-upon-pie.

118
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,954
What are you doing? Are you sulking?

119
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:49,954
Let me see. Are you sulking?

120
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:52,631
Is that what you're doing?

121
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:54,633
Never mind.

122
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:58,963
Just don't bother yourself.

123
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:12,647
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf,
Virginia Woolf, Virginia Woolf?

124
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:22,987
What's wrong? Didn't think it's funny?
I thought it was a scream.

125
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:24,492
It was all right.

126
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,995
You laughed when you heard it
at the party.

127
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:28,826
I smiled. I didn't laugh.

128
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:31,503
You laughed your goddamn head off!

129
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:32,671
It was all right.

130
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:34,669
It was a scream.

131
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,843
It was very funny, yes.

132
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:40,272
You make me puke.

133
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,682
You make me puke.

134
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,448
Wasn't a very nice thing to say.

135
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:48,346
That wasn't what?

136
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:50,522
A very nice thing to say.

137
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,521
Oh, I like your anger.

138
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:56,361
I think that's what I like
about you most.

139
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:58,030
Your anger.

140
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,605
You are such a simp!

141
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,703
You haven't got...

142
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,139
...the what?

143
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:11,675
Guts?

144
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:15,047
Phrase-maker.

145
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:39,741
You never put any ice in my drink.
Why is that?

146
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:43,735
I always put ice in your drinks.
You eat it, that's all.

147
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,573
It's this habit you've got of chewing
on your ice cubes like a cocker spaniel.

148
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:52,243
You'll crack your big teeth.

149
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:55,253
Well, they're my big teeth.

150
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:57,419
Yeah, some of them, some of them.

151
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,751
I've got more teeth than you have.

152
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:01,255
Two more.

153
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,597
And you're going bald.

154
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:07,432
So are you.

155
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:27,110
Hello, honey.

156
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:34,126
Come on and give your mommy
a big sloppy kiss.

157
00:13:35,631 --> 00:13:38,293
I want a big sloppy kiss!

158
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:40,431
I don't want to kiss you right now.

159
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:44,796
Where are these people you invited?

160
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,804
Where is this good looking, well-built
young man and his slim-hipped wife?

161
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:52,974
Talking to Daddy. They'll be here.

162
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:57,641
Why didn't you want to kiss me?

163
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,729
Why didn't you want to kiss me?

164
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:17,161
If I kissed you I'd get all excited.
I'd get beside myself...

165
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:20,839
...and then I'd have to take you by
force on the living room rug.

166
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:25,670
Then our guests would walk in and
what would your father say about that?

167
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:27,842
Oh, you pig!

168
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:32,517
Fix me another drink, lover.

169
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:35,486
God, you can swill it down, can't you?

170
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:37,181
I'm thirsty!

171
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:38,515
Oh, Jesus!

172
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:42,854
I can drink you under any table you
want, so don't worry about me.

173
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,862
You got the prize years ago.
You've won every abomination award.

174
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:51,370
I swear if you existed I'd divorce you.

175
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:54,835
- Stay on your feet for your guests.
- I can't even see you!

176
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:59,370
If you pass out or throw up...
And try to keep your clothes on too.

177
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:04,049
There's no more sickening sight than
you drunk and your skirt over your head.

178
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:06,377
Your heads, I should say.

179
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:09,717
Party! Party!

180
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,754
I'm really looking forward to this.

181
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:14,930
- Go answer the door.
- You answer it.

182
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,392
Get to that door, you!

183
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:18,698
Come on in!

184
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:20,562
Get over and answer that door.

185
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:25,067
All right. Whatever love wants.
Just don't start on the bit, that's all.

186
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:26,965
The bit?

187
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,576
What language is that?
Imitating one of your students?

188
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:33,905
Don't start in on the bit
about the kid, that's all.

189
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:36,547
- What do you take me for?
- Much too much.

190
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:38,743
I'll start in on the kid if I want to.

191
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:40,248
I'd advise against it.

192
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,752
Well, good for you.
Get over there and open that door.

193
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:45,253
You've been advised.

194
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:46,583
Sure. Get over there.

195
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,760
Yes, love. Whatever love wants.

196
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:51,259
Some people still have manners...

197
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,262
...and just don't break into
people's houses.

198
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:58,266
Even if they hear a subhuman monster
yowling at them from inside.

199
00:15:58,607 --> 00:15:59,767
Goddamn you!

200
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,719
You must be our little guests.

201
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:14,514
Just ignore old sourpuss here.
Come on in, kids!

202
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:17,957
Just hand your coats to old sourpuss
here.

203
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,791
Perhaps we shouldn't have come.

204
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,619
Yes, it is late!

205
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:25,798
Late! Are you kidding?
Just throw your stuff down any place.

206
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:28,968
Furniture, floor.
Makes no difference around here.

207
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,600
I told you we shouldn't have come.

208
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:33,968
I said come on in. Now come on!

209
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:38,643
Look, muckmouth, you cut that out!

210
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:41,976
Martha's a devil with language.

211
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,019
Kids, sit down.

212
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:51,986
Isn't this lovely?

213
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:57,064
- Yes, indeed. Very handsome.
- Thank you.

214
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:13,941
Who did the painting?

215
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:19,009
Some Greek with a mustache
Martha attacked one night in a...

216
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,016
It's got a...

217
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:26,494
- Quiet intensity?
- Well, no...

218
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:29,027
Then a certain
noisy relaxed quality maybe?

219
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:33,027
How about a quietly
noisy relaxed intensity?

220
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:35,032
Dear, you're being joshed.

221
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:36,864
I'm aware of that.

222
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:38,195
I am sorry.

223
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,034
It's actually a pictorial representation
of the order of Martha's mind.

224
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:47,674
Fix the kids a drink.

225
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,747
What would you like to drink?

226
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:53,584
What would you like?

227
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:57,715
A little brandy maybe.
Never mix, never worry!

228
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,221
Brandy? Just brandy.
Simple, simple.

229
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:02,029
What about you...

230
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:07,425
Bourbon, if you don't mind.

231
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,069
Mind? I don't mind.
Don't think I mind.

232
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:12,236
Martha, rubbing alcohol for you?

233
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:14,565
Sure. Never mix, never worry!

234
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,753
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?

235
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:33,092
Wasn't that funny? That was so funny!

236
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:34,559
Yes, it was.

237
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:36,924
I thought I'd bust a gut!

238
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:41,933
George didn't think it was funny.

239
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:45,763
Martha thinks that unless you
bust a gut you're not amused.

240
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:48,770
Unless you carry on like a hyena
you're not having fun.

241
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:51,944
I certainly had fun.
It was a wonderful party!

242
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:56,275
- It certainly was.
- Your father, he is so wonderful!

243
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:01,449
He's quite a guy, isn't he?

244
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,121
You better believe it.

245
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,948
He's a marvelous man.

246
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:07,455
I'm not tearing him down.
We know he's a god.

247
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:09,127
You lay off my father.

248
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:12,456
When you've had as many
faculty parties as I have...

249
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:14,132
I rather appreciated it.

250
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:18,804
I mean aside from enjoying it,
I appreciated it.

251
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:23,802
Meeting, introducing, how he had us
stay at the Inn till our place is ready.

252
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:25,774
When I taught in Kansas...

253
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:27,447
You won't believe it...

254
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:32,643
...but we had to make our way all by
ourselves. Isn't that right, dear?

255
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:34,819
We had to make our own way.

256
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:39,323
I'd have to go up to the wives
in the library or the supermarket...

257
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:42,152
...and say, Hello, I am new here.

258
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:45,989
You must be Mrs. So-and-so,
Doctor So-and-so's wife.

259
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,499
It really wasn't very nice at all.

260
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:53,864
Daddy knows how to run things.

261
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,041
He's a remarkable man.

262
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:57,709
You bet your sweet life.

263
00:19:58,714 --> 00:19:59,874
I'll tell you a secret.

264
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:05,043
There are easier things in this world,
if you teach at the university...

265
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:07,378
...than being married
to the daughter of...

266
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:11,386
...the president of that university.
There are easier things.

267
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:16,687
It's a great opportunity. For some men
it would be the chance of a lifetime.

268
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:20,391
There are, believe me,
easier things in this world.

269
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:23,398
Some men would give their right arm
for the chance!

270
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:28,233
In reality that sacrifice is of a more
private portion of the anatomy.

271
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:32,240
Could you show me where the...

272
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:33,578
Are you all right?

273
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:38,080
Of course, dear. I just want to
put some powder on my nose.

274
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:40,748
Show her where we keep the euphemism?

275
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,760
I'm sorry. I want to show you
the house anyway.

276
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:49,896
We'll be back, dear.

277
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:53,431
Honestly, George, you burn me up!

278
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:55,003
You really do!

279
00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:59,437
Don't shoot your mouth off
about you-know-what.

280
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:03,100
I'll talk about
any goddamn thing I want to!

281
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:04,605
Okay, vanish!

282
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,279
Any goddamn thing I want!

283
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,707
What'll it be?

284
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:40,471
I'll stick to bourbon.

285
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,151
You're in the Math Department?

286
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,223
No.

287
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:57,996
Martha said so.
I think that's what she said.

288
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:06,668
Why'd you decide to be a teacher?

289
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:11,005
The same things that motivated you,
I imagine.

290
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:12,677
Oh? What were they?

291
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:15,840
What were the things that motivated me?

292
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:18,175
Well, I'm sure I don't know.

293
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:21,185
You said the things that motivated you
and me were the same.

294
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:22,854
I said I imagined they were.

295
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,451
Oh, did you?

296
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:37,132
You like it here?

297
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:40,367
Yes, it's fine.

298
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:42,040
I meant the university.

299
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:46,009
I know. I meant the university.

300
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:48,880
Well, I like it fine.

301
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,893
You've been here for quite a long time,
haven't you?

302
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:15,070
Oh, yes. Ever since I married
what's-her-name. Martha.

303
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:18,735
Even before that. Forever.

304
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:21,078
Dashed hopes and good intentions.

305
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:25,076
Good, better, best, bested!

306
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:29,086
How do you like that for a declension?

307
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:30,922
You didn't answer my question.

308
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:36,421
Don't condescend. I asked you
how you liked that declension.

309
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,965
I don't know what to say.

310
00:23:40,435 --> 00:23:41,766
You don't know what to say?

311
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,771
Shall I say it's funny,
so you can say it's sad?

312
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:50,775
Or shall I say it's sad so you can say
it's funny? You can play that game!

313
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:53,279
- Very good!
- I think we'll just...

314
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:56,273
Now, calm down. Just calm down.
All right?

315
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:57,778
Another drink? Here.

316
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,452
I still have one.
And when my wife comes down...

317
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:06,788
What I mean is, you and your wife
seem to be having some sort of a...

318
00:24:07,462 --> 00:24:11,125
Martha and I are having nothing.
Martha and I are merely exercising.

319
00:24:11,466 --> 00:24:14,629
We're walking what's left of our wits.
Pay no attention.

320
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,961
Now let's sit down and talk, huh?

321
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:21,473
It's just I don't like to become
involved in other people's affairs.

322
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:25,640
You'll get over that. Small college.
Musical beds is the faculty sport.

323
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:26,811
Sir?

324
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:29,982
Never mind. I wish you wouldn't go
sir. How old are you?

325
00:24:30,485 --> 00:24:31,474
Twenty-eight.

326
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:32,983
I'm forty-something.

327
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:36,489
Aren't you surprised?
Don't I look older?

328
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:40,325
I think you look fine.

329
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:43,995
I've always been lean. I play handball.
How much do you weigh?

330
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,333
155, 160, something like that?
You play handball?

331
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,535
- Not very well.
- We'll play sometime.

332
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:55,176
Martha is 108... years old.
She weighs somewhat more than that.

333
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,499
How old is your wife?

334
00:24:57,846 --> 00:24:59,177
She's twenty-six.

335
00:24:59,514 --> 00:25:03,006
Martha is a remarkable woman.
I imagine she weighs around 110.

336
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:04,340
Your wife weighs...

337
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:07,177
No, my boy, your wife.
My wife is Martha.

338
00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:09,151
Yes, I know.

339
00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:12,854
If you were married to Martha
you'd know what it means.

340
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:16,853
If I were married to your wife,
I'd know what that means.

341
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:24,199
Martha says you are in
the Math Department or something.

342
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:26,696
No, I'm not.

343
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:30,205
She's seldom mistaken.
Maybe you should be in it.

344
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:33,640
I'm a biologist.
I'm in the Biology Department.

345
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:42,887
You're the one's going to make all
that trouble making everyone the same.

346
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:46,388
Rearranging the chromozones,
or whatever it is, right?

347
00:25:47,562 --> 00:25:49,393
Not exactly. Chromosomes.

348
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:51,058
I'm very mistrustful.

349
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,892
You think we learn nothing from history?
I'm in the History Department.

350
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,536
Yes, I know.

351
00:25:57,739 --> 00:26:00,230
Martha tells me I'm in
the History Department...

352
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:05,069
...as opposed to being the History
Department, in the sense of running it.

353
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:08,246
I do not run the History Department.

354
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:10,414
I don't run the Biology Department.

355
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:12,246
You're twenty-one. Twenty-eight.

356
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:16,747
Perhaps when you're forty-something
you'll run the History Department.

357
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:18,923
Biology Department.

358
00:26:19,427 --> 00:26:21,918
I'm really very mistrustful!

359
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:26,757
I read somewhere that science fiction
is not really fiction at all.

360
00:26:27,102 --> 00:26:31,198
That you rearrange my genes so that
everyone will be like everyone else.

361
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:34,439
I suspect we shall not have
much music or painting.

362
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:39,443
But we'll have a civilization of
sublime young men much like yourself.

363
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:43,945
Cultures and races will vanish.
The ants will take over the world.

364
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:46,450
Don't know much about science, do you?

365
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:49,621
I know history.
I know when I'm being threatened.

366
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:53,954
Your wife doesn't have any hips,
does she?

367
00:26:55,964 --> 00:27:00,298
I'm not hip-happy. I was implying
that your wife is slim-hipped.

368
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:02,864
Yes, she is.

369
00:27:03,471 --> 00:27:04,460
You got any kids?

370
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,971
No. Not yet. You?

371
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:08,799
For me to know and you to find out.

372
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:13,546
No kids, huh?

373
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:15,143
What's wrong?

374
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,783
Nothing. We wanted to wait
till we're settled.

375
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:23,985
Think you'll be happy
here at New Carthage?

376
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,992
Well, we hope to stay here.
I don't mean forever.

377
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:31,659
Don't bandy that about.
The Old Man wouldn't like it.

378
00:27:33,335 --> 00:27:37,499
Martha's father expects his staff
to come here and grow old...

379
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,239
...and fall in the line of service.

380
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:42,672
One man, a professor of Latin...

381
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:45,673
...actually fell in the
cafeteria line one lunch.

382
00:27:46,014 --> 00:27:49,506
But the Old Man isn't falling anywhere.
He isn't going to die.

383
00:27:50,352 --> 00:27:51,683
There are rumors...

384
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,683
...which you can't breathe to Martha
for she foams at the mouth...

385
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:57,681
...that the Old Man, her father...

386
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:01,189
...is over two hundred years old.

387
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:04,859
There's an irony there, but I'm not
drunk enough to figure it out.

388
00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:09,525
Damnit!

389
00:28:10,205 --> 00:28:13,538
I wonder what women talk about
when men talk. I must find out.

390
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:15,870
What do you want?

391
00:28:18,213 --> 00:28:20,044
Isn't that a wonderful sound?

392
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:22,247
How many kids you having?

393
00:28:23,218 --> 00:28:24,879
I don't know. My wife is...

394
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,053
Slim-hipped.
Well, there's one of you at least.

395
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:33,054
You must see this house, dear.
This is such a wonderful old house.

396
00:28:34,562 --> 00:28:36,826
For Christ's sake, hang on a minute!

397
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:38,896
She'll be right down, she's changing.

398
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:41,225
She's changing? What, her clothes?

399
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,800
- Her dress.
- Why?

400
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:45,871
I imagine that she wants
to be comfortable.

401
00:28:46,074 --> 00:28:47,735
Oh, she does, does she?

402
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:49,567
You don't know!

403
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,581
- You all right, dear?
- Yes, dear, perfectly fine.

404
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,740
She wants to be comfortable?

405
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:58,750
Well, we'll see about that!

406
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:01,051
I didn't know that you had a son.

407
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:07,251
- A son. I hadn't known.
- You to know and me to find out, huh?

408
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:10,257
Tomorrow is his birthday.
He will be sixteen.

409
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,765
She told you?

410
00:29:13,868 --> 00:29:15,495
- She told you about him?
- Yes.

411
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:18,295
You said she's changing?

412
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:21,275
- And she mentioned...
- Your son's birthday.

413
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:27,604
You look pale. Would you like...

414
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:31,441
Yes, dear a little more brandy maybe.
Just a drop.

415
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,446
The bar?

416
00:29:33,922 --> 00:29:37,790
Yes, by all means, drink away.
You'll need it as years go on.

417
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:41,125
Damn destructive...

418
00:29:41,463 --> 00:29:42,953
What time is it, dear?

419
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:46,493
- 2:30.
- So late!

420
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:47,961
We should get home.

421
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,994
Keeping the baby sitter up?

422
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:53,296
I said we didn't have children.

423
00:29:54,142 --> 00:29:56,133
Sorry, I wasn't even listening.

424
00:29:56,478 --> 00:29:58,309
Or thinking. Whichever applies.

425
00:29:59,147 --> 00:30:00,273
We'll go in a while.

426
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:02,138
No, you mustn't!

427
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:07,647
Martha is changing, and not for me.
Martha hasn't changed for me in years.

428
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:11,982
It means we're going to be here days.
You're being accorded an honor.

429
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:16,491
Don't forget Martha is the daughter
of our beloved boss... his right arm.

430
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:19,827
I'd use another word,
but leave that sort of talk to Martha.

431
00:30:20,335 --> 00:30:21,632
What sort of talk?

432
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,829
Well, now!

433
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:31,304
Why, Martha, your Sunday chapel dress!

434
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:33,978
Oh, that's most attractive!

435
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:35,646
You like it? Good.

436
00:30:37,051 --> 00:30:39,645
What do you mean screaming
up the stairs at me?

437
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:42,982
We got lonely for the soft purr
of your little voice.

438
00:30:43,658 --> 00:30:46,491
Well, you just trot over
to the bar-ie-poo...

439
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:49,820
...and make your little mommy
a great big drink.

440
00:30:50,164 --> 00:30:51,324
That's right!

441
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:59,172
You're quite a guy, getting your masters
when you were what, 12?

442
00:31:00,008 --> 00:31:02,499
- Hear that, George?
- 12 and a half, actually.

443
00:31:03,344 --> 00:31:04,311
19, really.

444
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:07,447
- You needn't have mentioned it.
- I'm proud of you!

445
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:09,913
- I'm very impressed.
- You're damn right!

446
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:14,020
I'm wracked with jealousy.
What do you want me to do, throw up?

447
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,018
That's very impressive.
You should be proud.

448
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:20,350
He's a pretty nice fellow.

449
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:23,190
You might take over
the History Department.

450
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:24,695
Biology Department.

451
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:27,027
Yes. I'm preoccupied with history.

452
00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:31,870
What a remark.
I am preoccupied with history.

453
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:38,368
George is not. George is preoccupied
with the History Department.

454
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,871
He's preoccupied with it...

455
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:45,379
...because he is not the
History Department, he is only in it.

456
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,211
We went through that
while you were upstairs.

457
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:50,387
That's right, baby, keep it clean.

458
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:54,058
George is bogged down
in the History Department.

459
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:57,720
He's an old bog
in the History Department.

460
00:31:58,199 --> 00:31:59,757
That's what George is...

461
00:31:59,968 --> 00:32:03,927
...A bog, a fen, a G.D. Swamp!

462
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:09,899
Hey, swamp! Hey, swampy!

463
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:16,076
Can I get you something?

464
00:32:18,252 --> 00:32:19,082
Well, sure.

465
00:32:19,554 --> 00:32:23,251
You can light my cigarette
if you're of a mind to.

466
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:25,582
No. There are limits.

467
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:27,917
A man puts up with only so much...

468
00:32:28,262 --> 00:32:31,925
...before he descends on the
evolutionary ladder which is your line.

469
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:36,601
I'll hold your hand when it's dark
and you're afraid of the bogeyman.

470
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:39,930
And I'll tote your gin bottles
out after midnight so no one sees.

471
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:44,608
But I will not light your cigarette.
And that, as they say, is that.

472
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:52,947
Hey, you played football, huh?

473
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:55,118
Yes, I was a quarterback.

474
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:57,790
But I was much more adept at boxing.

475
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:01,288
Boxing? You hear that, George?

476
00:33:02,797 --> 00:33:05,891
Must've been good. Doesn't look
like you got hit in the face.

477
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,133
He was intercollegiate state
middleweight champion.

478
00:33:10,972 --> 00:33:14,135
Still looks like you have a
pretty good body, is that right?

479
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:15,707
Decency forbids...

480
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,138
Shut up!

481
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:20,637
Is that right?
Have you kept your body up?

482
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:23,640
It's still pretty good. I work out.

483
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:27,981
Yes, he has a very firm body.

484
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:30,957
Have you? I think that's very nice.

485
00:33:31,325 --> 00:33:33,987
You know, once you have it,
you never know...

486
00:33:34,328 --> 00:33:35,818
...when it'll come in handy!

487
00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:40,967
I say, why give it up until you have to?

488
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,933
I couldn't agree with you more!

489
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:49,002
Your obscenity is beyond human...

490
00:33:49,343 --> 00:33:52,176
George here doesn't cotton
too much to body talk.

491
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:57,373
Paunchy isn't happy when the talk
moves to muscles. How much you weigh?

492
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:00,686
155, 150...

493
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,848
Still at the old middleweight limit?
That's pretty good!

494
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,062
Tell them about the boxing match we had.

495
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:13,697
Christ!

496
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:16,666
Tell them about it.

497
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:18,997
You tell them, you're good at it.

498
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,204
- Is he all right?
- Him? Oh, sure.

499
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:24,940
We had this boxing match...

500
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:27,204
...a couple years after we married.

501
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:29,539
A boxing match? The two of you?

502
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:32,709
Yeah, the two of us. Really.

503
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:35,211
I can't imagine it!

504
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:38,218
Well, it wasn't in a ring
or anything like that.

505
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:41,225
Daddy was on this physical fitness kick.

506
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:45,559
He had a couple of us over one Sunday
and we all went out back...

507
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:50,064
...and Daddy put the gloves on himself
and asked George to box with him.

508
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:53,897
And George didn't want to.

509
00:34:54,642 --> 00:34:59,602
So Daddy said, Come on, young man!
What sort of a son-in-law are you? 

510
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:05,083
And while this was going on,
I don't know why I did it...

511
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:07,887
...I got into a pair of gloves myself...

512
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:12,583
...and I snuck up behind George,
just kidding and yelled, Hey, George! 

513
00:35:13,261 --> 00:35:17,254
And let go with a sort of roundhouse
right. Just kidding, you know.

514
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:22,661
And George wheeled around real quick
and caught it right in the jaw!

515
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:28,332
He caught it right in the jaw!

516
00:35:29,443 --> 00:35:33,812
He was off-balance. He must have been.
And then he landed...

517
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,608
...flat in a huckleberry bush!

518
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,541
Pow, you're dead.

519
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:09,306
Where'd you get that, you bastard?

520
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,312
I've had it awhile. Liked that, did
you?

521
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:13,642
Bastard!

522
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:19,316
Oh, that was pretty good.
Hey, give me a kiss.

523
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,151
- Later, sweetie.
- Give me a kiss.

524
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,335
So that's what you're after?
We having blue games for the guests?

525
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:34,004
Everything in its place.
Everything in it's own good time.

526
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:36,833
Drinks now. Drinks for all.

527
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:39,169
You've nibbled away at your glass.

528
00:36:40,014 --> 00:36:43,347
I need something.
I was never so frightened in my life.

529
00:36:43,684 --> 00:36:45,276
Weren't you frightened?

530
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:49,448
- I don't remember.
- I bet you were.

531
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,521
Did you think I was going to kill you?

532
00:36:51,826 --> 00:36:54,351
You? Kill me? That's a laugh!

533
00:36:54,695 --> 00:36:55,855
I might some day.

534
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:58,559
Fat chance!

535
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,130
Where's the john?

536
00:37:01,202 --> 00:37:02,362
Down the hall and right.

537
00:37:02,703 --> 00:37:05,194
Don't come back with
any guns or anything.

538
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,201
You don't need any props,
do you, baby?

539
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:10,108
I'll bet not.

540
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,712
- No fake gun for you!
- May I leave my drink here?

541
00:37:14,081 --> 00:37:17,608
Why not? We've got half-filled glasses
wherever Martha left them.

542
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:20,878
In the closet, the bathtub.
I found one in the freezer.

543
00:37:21,088 --> 00:37:24,057
- Oh, you did not!
- Yes, I did.

544
00:37:26,894 --> 00:37:29,454
- Brandy gives you no hangover?
- I never mix.

545
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,997
- I don't drink very much either.
- Oh, good.

546
00:37:34,068 --> 00:37:36,559
Your husband was telling us
about chromosomes.

547
00:37:37,571 --> 00:37:40,870
- Chromosomes. He's a biologist.
- He's in the Math Department.

548
00:37:41,075 --> 00:37:43,566
- Biologist.
- He's in the Math Department!

549
00:37:45,613 --> 00:37:46,739
Biology.

550
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,747
Are you sure?

551
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:52,245
Well, I ought to be sure.

552
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:56,416
So he's a biologist. Good for him!

553
00:37:57,425 --> 00:37:59,086
Biology's even better.

554
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,752
It's at the meat of things.
You're at the meat of things.

555
00:38:03,297 --> 00:38:07,097
- She thought you were Math Department.
- Maybe I ought to be.

556
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:11,098
You stay right where you are.
Stay right at the meat of things.

557
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:14,264
You're obsessed by that phrase.
It's ugly.

558
00:38:14,608 --> 00:38:15,939
You stay right there.

559
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:21,104
You can take over the History Department
as easy from there as any place else.

560
00:38:21,782 --> 00:38:25,115
Somebody's got to take over
the History Department some day.

561
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:28,786
And it ain't gonna be Georgie-boy
over there, that's for sure.

562
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:31,648
Are you swampy, are you?

563
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,452
In my mind you are bedded in cement
up to the neck.

564
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,722
No, up to the nose, it's quieter.

565
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:46,132
When is your son...

566
00:38:47,341 --> 00:38:47,932
What?

567
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:49,640
Something about your son.

568
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:56,817
When is your son coming home?

569
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:05,656
When's our son coming home?

570
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:06,823
Never mind.

571
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:10,494
I want to know. You brought it up.
When's he coming home?

572
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:14,195
I said never mind.
I'm sorry I brought it up.

573
00:39:14,468 --> 00:39:17,835
Him up! Not it! You brought him up,
more or less.

574
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:21,672
When's the little bugger appearing?
Isn't tomorrow his birthday?

575
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:23,840
I don't want to talk about it.

576
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:26,537
I don't want to talk about it!

577
00:39:26,747 --> 00:39:29,181
She doesn't want to talk about it, him.

578
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:32,250
Martha is sorry she brought it up. Him.

579
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,852
When's the little bugger coming home?

580
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:40,854
Since you had the bad taste to
bring it up, when is the bugger coming?

581
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:44,525
George talks disparagingly about
the little bugger...

582
00:39:44,865 --> 00:39:46,890
...because he has problems.

583
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:49,262
What problems has the little bugger got?

584
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,200
Not the little bugger.
Stop calling him that!

585
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:57,307
- You! You've got problems!
- Never heard anything more ridiculous.

586
00:39:57,878 --> 00:39:59,368
Neither have I!

587
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:04,044
George's biggest problem
about the... about our son...

588
00:40:04,385 --> 00:40:08,219
...about our great big son is that deep
down in the private pit of his gut...

589
00:40:08,556 --> 00:40:11,719
...he is not completely sure that it's
his own kid.

590
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:14,027
My God, you're a wicked woman!

591
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:18,562
And I've told you a million times,
I wouldn't conceive with anyone else.

592
00:40:18,899 --> 00:40:20,764
A deeply wicked person.

593
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,330
I'm not sure this is a subject for...

594
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:28,405
Martha's lying. I want you
to know that Martha is lying.

595
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:32,076
There are few things I am certain of,
but the one thing...

596
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:34,839
...in this sinking world
that I am sure of...

597
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:38,246
...is my partnership,
my chromosomoligical partnership...

598
00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:42,650
...in the creation of our blond-eyed,
blue-haired son.

599
00:40:43,724 --> 00:40:45,089
I'm so glad.

600
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:49,287
- A very pretty speech, George.
- Thank you, Martha.

601
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,863
You rose to the occasion good.
Real good.

602
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,531
Well. Real well!

603
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,635
Martha knows better.

604
00:40:57,905 --> 00:41:00,703
Yes, I've been to college
like everybody else.

605
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:04,533
George, our son does not
have blue hair.

606
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,212
Or blue eyes for that matter.
He has green eyes like me.

607
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,881
Beautiful, beautiful green eyes.

608
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,541
He has blue eyes.

609
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,581
Green.

610
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:14,884
Blue, Martha.

611
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,587
Green, you bastard!

612
00:41:17,591 --> 00:41:19,889
Tut-tut yourself, you old floozy.

613
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:21,889
He's not a floozie.

614
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,460
He can't be a floozie.
You're a floozie.

615
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,598
Now you just watch yourself!

616
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,399
All right!

617
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,301
I'd like another little nipper
of brandy please.

618
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,508
- I think you've had enough.
- Nonsense!

619
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,337
- We're all ready, I think.
- Nonsense!

620
00:41:41,048 --> 00:41:45,075
George has watery blue eyes,
kind of milky blue.

621
00:41:45,286 --> 00:41:46,617
Make up your mind.

622
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,551
I gave you the benefit of a doubt.
Daddy has green eyes too.

623
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:55,252
No, he has tiny red eyes, like a white
mouse. In fact, he is a white mouse.

624
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,422
You wouldn't say that if he was here.
You're a coward!

625
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:03,100
You know that shock of white hair
and these beady red eyes?

626
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,098
A great big white mouse.

627
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:10,437
George hates Daddy. Not for anything
Daddy's done to him, but for his own...

628
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:11,938
Inadequacies?

629
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:15,271
That's right.
You hit it right on the snout!

630
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,445
You know why the S.O.B.
Hates my father?

631
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,119
When George came to the History
Department, about 500 years ago...

632
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,616
...Daddy approved of him.

633
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:28,117
And you want to know what I did,
dumb cluck that I am?

634
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,327
I fell for him!

635
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:32,130
I like that!

636
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,434
She did, you should have seen it.

637
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:38,127
She'd sit outside my room at night
and howl and claw at the turf.

638
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:40,270
I couldn't work so I married her.

639
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,474
I actually fell for him.

640
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,810
It! That! There!

641
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,637
Martha's a romantic at heart.

642
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,477
That I am.

643
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,654
I actually fell for him.
And the match seemed practical too.

644
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:01,325
For a while Daddy thought
George had the stuff...

645
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,823
...to take over when
he was ready to retire.

646
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,027
- Stop it!
- What do you want?!

647
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:10,299
- I wouldn't go on if I were you.
- You wouldn't? Well, you're not!

648
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:13,200
You've already sprung a leak
about you-know-what.

649
00:43:13,741 --> 00:43:14,366
What?

650
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,836
About the little bugger. Our son.

651
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,168
If you start in on this, I warn you...

652
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,380
- I stand warned.
- Do we have to go through this?

653
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,047
Anyway, I married the S.O.B.
I had it all planned out.

654
00:43:26,253 --> 00:43:30,519
First he'd take over the History
Department, then the whole college.

655
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,519
That's how it was supposed to be!

656
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,849
Getting angry?

657
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:37,357
That was how it was supposed to be.
All very simple.

658
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,531
Daddy thought it was a good idea too.
For a while!

659
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,530
Until he started watching
for a couple of years.

660
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:44,860
Getting angry?

661
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,196
Till he watched for a couple years...

662
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,203
...and started thinking
it wasn't such a good idea.

663
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,536
That maybe Georgie-boy
didn't have the stuff!

664
00:43:54,014 --> 00:43:55,743
That he didn't have it in him!

665
00:43:55,949 --> 00:43:58,383
- Stop it, Martha!
- Like hell, I will!

666
00:43:59,453 --> 00:44:02,547
George didn't have much push.
He wasn't aggressive.

667
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,381
In fact, he was sort of a flop!

668
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,221
A great big, fat flop!

669
00:44:09,263 --> 00:44:10,730
I said stop it!

670
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:15,399
I hope that was an empty bottle.
You can't afford to waste good liquor.

671
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:19,570
Not on your salary! Not on
an associate professor's salary!

672
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:23,570
So here I am, stuck with this flop...

673
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,243
...this bog in the History Department.

674
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,071
Who's married
to the president's daughter...

675
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:33,409
...who's expected to be somebody.
Not just a nobody!

676
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:37,417
A bookworm who's so
goddamn complacent...

677
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,090
...he can't make anything
out of himself.

678
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:43,760
That doesn't have the guts
to make anybody proud of him!

679
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,431
All right, George, stop it!

680
00:44:50,804 --> 00:44:52,499
I'm going to be sick!

681
00:45:25,172 --> 00:45:27,640
She'll be all right.
I'll make some coffee.

682
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,205
- You sure?
- She'll be okay.

683
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,600
I'm really very sorry.

684
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:47,103
She really shouldn't drink.
She's frail.

685
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,107
Slim-hipped, as you say.

686
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:58,955
Where's my little yum-yum?
Where's Martha?

687
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,661
I think she's going to make some coffee.

688
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,766
She gets sick quite easily.

689
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:14,297
Martha? No, she hasn't been
sick a day in her life.

690
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,973
Unless you count time
she spends in the rest home.

691
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,801
No, no. My wife.

692
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:23,310
My wife gets sick quite easily.
Your wife is Martha.

693
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,650
I know.

694
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,814
She doesn't really spend any time
in a rest home?

695
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,316
Your wife?

696
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:35,984
No, yours.

697
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,161
Mine?

698
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,165
She doesn't. I would.

699
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,506
If I were her... she... I would.

700
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,178
But then I'm not and so I don't.

701
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,311
I'd like to, though.

702
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,854
It gets pretty bouncy
around here sometimes.

703
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,519
Yes, I'm sure.

704
00:49:10,764 --> 00:49:13,426
- Your wife throws up a lot?
- I didn't say that.

705
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,030
I said she gets sick quite easily.

706
00:49:17,237 --> 00:49:18,864
By sick I thought that you meant she...

707
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,399
It's true, actually.
She does throw up a lot.

708
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:23,701
The word is often.

709
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:27,873
Once she starts
there's practically no stopping.

710
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,942
She'll go right on for hours.

711
00:49:34,955 --> 00:49:36,582
Not all the time.

712
00:49:38,825 --> 00:49:39,883
Regularly.

713
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,991
- You can tell time by her?
- Just about.

714
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,809
I married her because she was pregnant.

715
00:50:02,716 --> 00:50:05,014
But you said you didn't have
any children.

716
00:50:05,218 --> 00:50:06,708
She wasn't really. It was a...

717
00:50:08,889 --> 00:50:10,220
...hysterical pregnancy.

718
00:50:12,392 --> 00:50:15,555
She blew up and then she went down.

719
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,292
And when she was up you married her?

720
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:22,797
Then she went down.

721
00:50:45,659 --> 00:50:47,559
When I was 16...

722
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:51,423
...and going to prep school,
during the Punic Wars...

723
00:50:54,034 --> 00:50:56,935
...a bunch of us would go to town
the first day of vacation...

724
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:59,261
...before we fanned out to our homes.

725
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:04,836
And in the evening
we would go to a gin mill...

726
00:51:05,112 --> 00:51:07,774
...owned by the gangster-father
of one of us...

727
00:51:08,115 --> 00:51:12,108
...and we would drink with the grown-ups
and listen to the jazz.

728
00:51:13,954 --> 00:51:15,785
And one time, in the bunch of us...

729
00:51:16,123 --> 00:51:17,681
...there was this...

730
00:51:18,225 --> 00:51:20,819
...boy who was 15...

731
00:51:21,628 --> 00:51:25,792
...and he had killed his mother
with a shotgun some years before.

732
00:51:27,134 --> 00:51:29,125
Completely accidentally...

733
00:51:29,469 --> 00:51:33,132
...without even an unconscious
motivation, I have no doubt at all.

734
00:51:35,242 --> 00:51:37,802
And this one time this boy
went with us and...

735
00:51:38,645 --> 00:51:40,840
...we ordered our drinks...

736
00:51:41,748 --> 00:51:44,012
...and when it came his turn he said...

737
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,652
I'll have bergin.

738
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:51,814
Give me some bergin please.
Bergin and water.

739
00:51:54,928 --> 00:51:56,452
We all laughed.

740
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:02,458
He was blond and he had the face
of a cherub, and we all laughed.

741
00:52:03,637 --> 00:52:07,129
And his cheeks went red
and the color rose in his neck.

742
00:52:07,674 --> 00:52:12,611
The waiter told people at the next table
what the boy said and they laughed...

743
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:17,507
...and then more people were told
and the laughter grew and grew.

744
00:52:22,756 --> 00:52:25,418
No one was laughing more than us...

745
00:52:25,759 --> 00:52:29,593
...and none of us more than the boy
who had shot his mother.

746
00:52:32,098 --> 00:52:36,262
And soon everyone in the gin mill
knew what the laughter was about...

747
00:52:36,603 --> 00:52:41,267
...and everyone started ordering bergin
and laughing when they ordered it.

748
00:52:42,442 --> 00:52:45,434
And soon, of course,
the laughter became less general...

749
00:52:45,779 --> 00:52:50,113
...but it did not subside entirely
for a very long time.

750
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:53,442
For always at this table or that...

751
00:52:53,954 --> 00:52:55,945
...someone would order bergin...

752
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:00,790
...and a whole new area
of laughter would rise.

753
00:53:02,629 --> 00:53:04,119
We drank free that night.

754
00:53:05,398 --> 00:53:07,628
We were bought champagne
by the management...

755
00:53:07,968 --> 00:53:11,131
...by the gangster-father of one of us.

756
00:53:13,306 --> 00:53:16,969
And, of course,
we suffered the next day...

757
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:21,644
...each of us alone,
on his train away from the city...

758
00:53:23,383 --> 00:53:27,149
...and each of us
with a grown-up's hangover.

759
00:53:29,656 --> 00:53:31,749
But it was the grandest day...

760
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:34,490
...of my...

761
00:53:36,029 --> 00:53:37,360
...youth.

762
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:50,807
What happened to the boy?

763
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,370
The boy who had shot his mother.

764
00:53:58,218 --> 00:53:59,207
I won't tell you.

765
00:54:02,422 --> 00:54:06,051
The next summer on a country road,
with his learner's permit...

766
00:54:06,259 --> 00:54:10,958
...and his father sitting to his right,
he swerved to avoid a porcupine...

767
00:54:12,065 --> 00:54:14,898
...and drove straight into a large tree.

768
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,728
He was not killed, of course.

769
00:54:19,906 --> 00:54:23,398
In the hospital when he was conscious
and out of danger...

770
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,234
...when they told him
his father was dead...

771
00:54:27,914 --> 00:54:30,906
...he began to laugh, I have been told.

772
00:54:32,252 --> 00:54:35,915
And his laughter grew
and would not stop.

773
00:54:37,924 --> 00:54:41,587
And it was not until after
they'd jammed a needle in his arm...

774
00:54:41,928 --> 00:54:46,262
...not until his consciousness
had slipped away from him...

775
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:50,262
...that his laughter subsided. Stopped.

776
00:54:52,439 --> 00:54:54,771
When he recovered
from his injuries enough...

777
00:54:55,108 --> 00:54:59,772
...so he could be moved without damage
should he struggle...

778
00:55:02,115 --> 00:55:04,140
...he was put in an asylum.

779
00:55:07,454 --> 00:55:09,115
That was thirty years ago.

780
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:12,451
Is he still there?

781
00:55:14,461 --> 00:55:15,519
Oh, yes.

782
00:55:16,963 --> 00:55:19,124
I'm told that for these thirty years...

783
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:22,798
...he has not uttered...

784
00:55:24,471 --> 00:55:27,133
...one sound.

785
00:55:49,362 --> 00:55:50,659
That's Big Martha.

786
00:55:51,531 --> 00:55:52,998
She's making coffee.

787
00:55:54,334 --> 00:55:57,997
For your hysterical wife,
who goes up and down.

788
00:55:59,005 --> 00:55:59,733
Went.

789
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,864
Up and down.

790
00:56:02,342 --> 00:56:04,333
Went? And no more?

791
00:56:05,345 --> 00:56:07,506
No more. Nothing.

792
00:56:10,016 --> 00:56:12,746
Martha doesn't have
hysterical pregnancies.

793
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,454
My wife had one.

794
00:56:15,688 --> 00:56:18,179
Martha doesn't have pregnancies at all.

795
00:56:21,861 --> 00:56:25,297
Do you have any other kids,
any daughters or anything?

796
00:56:26,866 --> 00:56:28,697
Do we have any what?

797
00:56:32,038 --> 00:56:34,165
I mean, do you only have
the one...

798
00:56:34,941 --> 00:56:36,533
...kid, your son?

799
00:56:38,711 --> 00:56:40,201
No, just one.

800
00:56:41,881 --> 00:56:43,109
One boy.

801
00:56:44,551 --> 00:56:45,916
Our son.

802
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,419
That's nice.

803
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:57,052
He's a comfort.

804
00:56:58,898 --> 00:57:00,229
He's a beanbag.

805
00:57:03,369 --> 00:57:04,336
A what?

806
00:57:04,571 --> 00:57:06,402
A beanbag. You wouldn't understand.

807
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:10,470
A beanbag!

808
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:14,204
I heard! I didn't say I was deaf,
I said I didn't understand!

809
00:57:14,414 --> 00:57:19,215
- You didn't say that at all.
- I was implying I didn't understand.

810
00:57:21,254 --> 00:57:22,721
- You're getting testy.
- I'm sorry!

811
00:57:22,922 --> 00:57:27,256
I just said our son, the apple of
our 3 eyes, Martha being a Cyclops...

812
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,921
...our son is a beanbag,
and you get testy.

813
00:57:30,263 --> 00:57:33,562
It's late, I'm tired.
I've been drinking since 9 o'clock.

814
00:57:33,766 --> 00:57:37,167
My wife is vomiting.
There's been a lot of screaming here.

815
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,634
You get testy, naturally.
Don't worry about it.

816
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,002
Anybody coming here gets testy.
Don't be upset.

817
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,404
- I'm not upset.
- You're testy.

818
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:53,942
I'd like to set you straight
about something while we're out here.

819
00:57:54,787 --> 00:57:56,948
About something Martha said.

820
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:00,282
Hark! Forest sounds.

821
00:58:01,294 --> 00:58:02,625
Animal noises.

822
00:58:05,198 --> 00:58:07,132
Oh, well, here's nursie!

823
00:58:08,134 --> 00:58:10,466
We're sitting up, we're having coffee.

824
00:58:12,138 --> 00:58:14,129
Is there anything I should do?

825
00:58:14,474 --> 00:58:18,808
No, you just stay there
and listen to Georgie's side of things.

826
00:58:19,312 --> 00:58:20,973
Bore yourself to death!

827
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,807
You clean up the mess you made in here?

828
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:27,142
No, Martha, I did not
clean up the mess I made.

829
00:58:28,521 --> 00:58:32,287
I've been trying for years
to clean up the mess I made.

830
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:34,354
Have you been trying for years?

831
00:58:34,561 --> 00:58:36,654
Accommodation, adjustment...

832
00:58:37,163 --> 00:58:39,654
...those do seem to be
in the order of things.

833
00:58:39,866 --> 00:58:41,663
Don't put me in the same class with you.

834
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:45,493
No, of course not.
I mean things are simpler for you.

835
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:49,130
You marry a woman
because she's all blown up.

836
00:58:49,342 --> 00:58:54,109
- Where I, in my old-fashioned way...
- There was more to it than that.

837
00:58:54,314 --> 00:58:56,305
Sure. I bet she has money too.

838
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:00,144
Yes.

839
00:59:06,526 --> 00:59:08,187
You mean I was right? I hit it?

840
00:59:08,861 --> 00:59:12,729
My God, what archery! First try, too.
How about that?

841
00:59:13,366 --> 00:59:15,357
- There were other things.
- Yes.

842
00:59:15,568 --> 00:59:17,195
To compensate.

843
00:59:18,037 --> 00:59:19,902
There always are.

844
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:22,236
Allow me.

845
00:59:25,044 --> 00:59:28,036
Tell me about your wife's money.

846
00:59:31,284 --> 00:59:32,216
No.

847
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:34,118
Okay, don't.

848
00:59:38,191 --> 00:59:40,921
My father-in-law was a man of the Lord.

849
00:59:42,195 --> 00:59:43,685
And he was very rich.

850
00:59:44,197 --> 00:59:45,186
What faith?

851
00:59:47,867 --> 00:59:49,027
My father-in-law...

852
00:59:50,203 --> 00:59:53,366
...was called by God
when he was six or something.

853
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:59,869
He started preaching, baptized people,
and he saved them and then...

854
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:05,783
...he traveled around a lot and
became pretty famous. Not like...

855
01:00:07,387 --> 01:00:08,877
...some of them but...

856
01:00:10,556 --> 01:00:12,319
...pretty famous.

857
01:00:15,228 --> 01:00:17,719
When he died he had a lot of money.

858
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:21,391
- God's money?
- No, his own.

859
01:00:22,468 --> 01:00:26,063
- What about God's money?
- He spent it and he saved his own.

860
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,230
I think that's very nice.

861
01:00:32,412 --> 01:00:34,437
Martha has money because...

862
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:37,480
...Martha's father's second wife...

863
01:00:37,684 --> 01:00:40,585
...not Martha's mother,
but after her mother died...

864
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,111
...was a very old lady...

865
01:00:43,323 --> 01:00:46,417
...who had warts, who was very rich.

866
01:00:46,993 --> 01:00:48,392
She was a witch!

867
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:53,032
She was a good witch,
and she married the white mouse...

868
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:55,530
...with the red eyes,
and he must have...

869
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,533
...nibbled her warts
or something...

870
01:01:00,139 --> 01:01:04,166
...because she went up in a
puff of smoke almost immediately.

871
01:01:06,846 --> 01:01:10,646
And all that was left,
apart from some wart medicine...

872
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:13,318
...was a big, fat will.

873
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,393
Maybe my father-in-law...

874
01:01:21,627 --> 01:01:24,790
...and the witch with the warts
should have gotten together.

875
01:01:26,132 --> 01:01:28,123
Because he was a mouse too.

876
01:01:29,836 --> 01:01:31,770
- He was?
- Sure!

877
01:01:34,474 --> 01:01:36,305
He was a church mouse!

878
01:01:53,326 --> 01:01:55,294
Your wife never mentioned a stepmother.

879
01:01:56,496 --> 01:01:57,724
Maybe it isn't true.

880
01:01:59,999 --> 01:02:03,162
You realize I've been
drawing you out on this stuff...

881
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:07,533
...because you're a threat to me
and I want to get the goods on you.

882
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:08,729
Sure.

883
01:02:09,008 --> 01:02:11,067
I've warned you. You stand warned.

884
01:02:11,277 --> 01:02:12,835
I stand warned.

885
01:02:15,281 --> 01:02:18,307
You sneaky types
worry me the most, you know.

886
01:02:18,518 --> 01:02:21,510
You ineffectual sons of bitches,
you're the worst.

887
01:02:21,854 --> 01:02:25,620
I'm glad you don't believe me.
You've got history on your side.

888
01:02:27,026 --> 01:02:30,518
You've got history on your side.
I've got biology on mine.

889
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:33,021
History, biology.

890
01:02:33,366 --> 01:02:35,334
- I know the difference.
- You don't act it.

891
01:02:35,701 --> 01:02:39,831
We decided you'd take over the History
Department first, then the whole works.

892
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:40,869
A step at a time.

893
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:49,211
What I thought I'd do is sort of
insinuate myself generally. You know!

894
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:51,210
Find all the weak spots.

895
01:02:52,585 --> 01:02:53,609
Like me.

896
01:02:54,387 --> 01:02:58,380
Become sort of a fact
and then turn into a...

897
01:03:00,793 --> 01:03:03,557
- A what?
- An inevitability?

898
01:03:04,063 --> 01:03:05,155
Exactly!

899
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:07,229
An inevitability.

900
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,562
Take over a few courses
from the older men.

901
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:15,230
Plow a few pertinent wives.

902
01:03:15,575 --> 01:03:16,564
Now that's it!

903
01:03:17,743 --> 01:03:19,904
You can shove aside
all the older men...

904
01:03:20,246 --> 01:03:23,409
...but until you're plowing pertinent
wives you're not working.

905
01:03:23,749 --> 01:03:25,740
That's the way to power. Plow 'em all!

906
01:03:28,921 --> 01:03:30,252
The way to a man's heart...

907
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:34,492
...the wide, inviting avenue to his job
is through his wife...

908
01:03:34,694 --> 01:03:36,161
...and don't you forget it.

909
01:03:36,362 --> 01:03:41,095
I bet your wife's got the most inviting
avenue on the whole campus!

910
01:03:45,104 --> 01:03:47,504
I mean, her father
being president and all.

911
01:03:48,608 --> 01:03:51,099
You bet your historical inevitability.

912
01:03:51,944 --> 01:03:54,936
I just better get her off
into the bushes right away.

913
01:03:55,147 --> 01:03:56,614
You'd certainly better.

914
01:03:59,619 --> 01:04:01,211
I almost think you're serious.

915
01:04:02,054 --> 01:04:05,182
No, you almost think you're serious.
And it scares you.

916
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:06,387
Me?

917
01:04:06,959 --> 01:04:07,857
Yes, you.

918
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,118
You're kidding!

919
01:04:09,462 --> 01:04:13,125
I wish I were. I'll give you some
good advice if you want me to.

920
01:04:13,466 --> 01:04:14,933
Good advice? From you?

921
01:04:15,968 --> 01:04:19,961
You haven't learned yet. Take it
wherever you can get it. Listen.

922
01:04:21,307 --> 01:04:23,298
I'm giving you good advice now.

923
01:04:24,977 --> 01:04:28,435
There's quicksand here and you'll be
dragged down before you know it.

924
01:04:28,648 --> 01:04:29,876
Sucked down!

925
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:34,483
You disgust me on principle and you're
a smug son of a bitch...

926
01:04:34,987 --> 01:04:38,650
...but I'm trying to give you
a survival kit. Do you hear me?

927
01:04:38,858 --> 01:04:40,621
I hear you. You come in loud.

928
01:04:40,993 --> 01:04:42,824
You want to play it by ear, right?

929
01:04:43,162 --> 01:04:46,825
Everything will work out anyway,
because the timetable's history, right?

930
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:50,158
Right. Just tend to your knitting,
grandma. I'll be okay.

931
01:04:50,503 --> 01:04:51,834
I've tried to...

932
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:54,328
...tried to reach you, to...

933
01:04:54,674 --> 01:04:55,663
Make contact?

934
01:04:56,842 --> 01:04:57,831
Communicate?

935
01:04:58,177 --> 01:04:59,166
Yes, exactly.

936
01:04:59,512 --> 01:05:04,006
Aw, that's touching. That's downright
moving, that's what that is.

937
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:05,476
Up yours!

938
01:05:05,685 --> 01:05:08,483
- What?
- You heard me.

939
01:05:16,195 --> 01:05:18,527
You take the trouble
to construct a civilization...

940
01:05:18,864 --> 01:05:23,528
...to build a society based on
the principles of... principle.

941
01:05:24,537 --> 01:05:28,371
You make government and art and realize
they are, must be, the same.

942
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:33,202
You bring things to the saddest point,
where there is something to lose.

943
01:05:33,879 --> 01:05:36,211
Then, all at once,
through all the music...

944
01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:38,813
...through the sensible sounds
of building...

945
01:05:39,218 --> 01:05:41,379
...attempting, comes the Dies Irae.

946
01:05:41,721 --> 01:05:44,383
And what is it?
What does the trumpet sound?

947
01:05:45,057 --> 01:05:46,388
Up yours!

948
01:05:52,565 --> 01:05:56,228
Here we are.
A little shaky, but on our feet.

949
01:05:56,435 --> 01:05:58,403
It wasn't too bad, dear, really.

950
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:01,400
- I'm not cold.
- Just put it on, we're leaving.

951
01:06:01,607 --> 01:06:03,575
- You're what?
- We're going home.

952
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:06,434
What's been going on here?

953
01:06:06,646 --> 01:06:08,637
- What have you been up to?
- I'll get the car.

954
01:06:08,848 --> 01:06:10,008
I'll call a cab.

955
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:13,912
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

956
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,588
Now let me see.
I think what I'm doing is...

957
01:06:16,922 --> 01:06:21,086
...I'm getting the car to take
our little guests home.

958
01:06:31,771 --> 01:06:33,432
Aren't you going to apologize?

959
01:06:33,773 --> 01:06:35,263
The road should've been straight.

960
01:06:35,608 --> 01:06:37,599
Not that. For making her throw up.

961
01:06:37,943 --> 01:06:40,377
- I did not make her throw up.
- You certainly did.

962
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,613
Who do you think did, sexy there?
He made his own wife sick?

963
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:47,248
- You make me sick.
- That's different.

964
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:49,454
Please! I throw up.

965
01:06:49,789 --> 01:06:52,587
I get sick occasionally all by myself,
without reason.

966
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:54,453
- Is that a fact?
- You're delicate, honey.

967
01:06:55,461 --> 01:06:56,894
I've always done it.

968
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,461
Like Big Ben?

969
01:06:58,664 --> 01:06:59,790
Watch it.

970
01:07:00,132 --> 01:07:03,192
George makes everybody sick.
When our son was a little boy...

971
01:07:03,869 --> 01:07:06,303
...he threw up all the time
because of George.

972
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:11,303
It got so whenever George came into
a room, he'd start right in retching.

973
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:14,308
Our son used to throw up all the time...

974
01:07:14,647 --> 01:07:16,478
...because you were always
fiddling at him.

975
01:07:16,816 --> 01:07:19,478
Into his bedroom,
kimono flying, fiddling...

976
01:07:19,819 --> 01:07:22,811
I suppose that's why he ran away
twice in one month.

977
01:07:23,155 --> 01:07:25,988
Twice in one month!
Six times in one year...

978
01:07:26,325 --> 01:07:29,817
Our son ran away from home
because Martha used to corner him.

979
01:07:30,162 --> 01:07:33,325
I never cornered
the son of a bitch in my life!

980
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:37,659
He'd run to me when I got home
and say, Mama's always coming at me.

981
01:07:38,003 --> 01:07:39,095
Liar!

982
01:07:40,172 --> 01:07:42,231
Always coming at him.
Very embarrassing!

983
01:07:42,675 --> 01:07:45,337
If it was so embarrassing,
why are you talking about it?

984
01:07:46,178 --> 01:07:47,839
I didn't want to talk about it at all.

985
01:07:48,514 --> 01:07:52,006
I wish I had some brandy.
I love brandy, I really do.

986
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,877
- Good for you.
- It steadies me.

987
01:07:55,087 --> 01:07:56,850
I used to drink brandy.

988
01:07:57,523 --> 01:07:59,184
You used to drink bergin, too.

989
01:07:59,525 --> 01:08:00,514
Shut up, Martha!

990
01:08:03,429 --> 01:08:05,226
- What?
- Nothing.

991
01:08:06,866 --> 01:08:10,859
Did he tell you about that?
Come on, he must have said something.

992
01:08:11,203 --> 01:08:14,695
Actually what we did is
we sort of danced around a little.

993
01:08:15,274 --> 01:08:17,333
I love dancing. I really do.

994
01:08:17,543 --> 01:08:18,373
He didn't mean that.

995
01:08:18,711 --> 01:08:22,545
Well, I didn't think that he did!
Two grown men dancing!

996
01:08:24,216 --> 01:08:27,879
He didn't tell how he tried to publish
a book and Daddy wouldn't let him?

997
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:30,880
- A book? What book?
- Just a book.

998
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:32,557
Just a book!

999
01:08:32,892 --> 01:08:34,325
Oh, look, dancing!

1000
01:08:34,794 --> 01:08:37,763
Why don't we dance?
I'd love some dancing.

1001
01:08:38,063 --> 01:08:40,031
- We're almost home.
- I want some dancing!

1002
01:08:40,232 --> 01:08:43,065
- That's not such a bad idea.
- Don't you love dancing?

1003
01:08:43,402 --> 01:08:46,565
- With the right man, yeah.
- I dance like the wind.

1004
01:08:47,907 --> 01:08:50,569
Stop the car. We're going dancing!

1005
01:08:50,776 --> 01:08:52,573
- For heaven's sake!
- Did you hear me?

1006
01:08:53,913 --> 01:08:55,505
Whatever love wants.

1007
01:09:02,188 --> 01:09:04,053
I dance like the wind!

1008
01:09:05,591 --> 01:09:07,252
Put one on, will you?

1009
01:09:08,093 --> 01:09:10,755
How are we going to work this,
mixed doubles?

1010
01:09:11,263 --> 01:09:13,254
You don't think I'm going
to dance with you?

1011
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:16,261
Not with him around.
And not with twinkle-toes either.

1012
01:09:16,669 --> 01:09:20,298
I'll dance with anyone!
I'll dance with myself!

1013
01:09:21,106 --> 01:09:24,974
- Honey, you'll get sick again.
- I dance like the wind!

1014
01:09:29,782 --> 01:09:32,114
All right, kiddies, choose up
and hit the sack.

1015
01:09:33,285 --> 01:09:35,947
All right, George, cut that out!

1016
01:09:41,293 --> 01:09:42,624
Cut it out, George!

1017
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,125
What, Martha?

1018
01:09:45,464 --> 01:09:47,625
All right, you son of a bitch!

1019
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:49,562
- What'd you say, love?
- It stopped!

1020
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:51,235
Why did it stop?

1021
01:09:53,305 --> 01:09:55,773
I said give me some change.

1022
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,007
Stop that!

1023
01:09:59,678 --> 01:10:02,613
You are always at me
when I'm having a good time!

1024
01:10:02,815 --> 01:10:07,115
Just leave me alone. I like to dance
and you don't want me to.

1025
01:10:07,319 --> 01:10:09,480
Just leave me alone!

1026
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:15,954
Choose it. Do your stuff.

1027
01:10:16,662 --> 01:10:17,993
You're damned right.

1028
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,764
Hi, sexy!

1029
01:10:20,032 --> 01:10:21,932
You want to dance, angel boobs?

1030
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:24,625
What'd you call my wife?

1031
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:29,964
No, if I can't do my interpretive dance,
I don't want to dance at all.

1032
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:31,799
I'll just sit here.

1033
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,972
Okay, stuff, let's go.

1034
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:41,009
- We'll just sit here and watch.
- That's right.

1035
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,993
You are strong, aren't you?

1036
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:57,833
I like that.

1037
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,902
They dance like they've danced before.

1038
01:11:01,106 --> 01:11:04,166
A familiar dance, monkey nipples,
they know it.

1039
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,000
I don't know what you mean.

1040
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:11,710
- I like the way you move.
- I like the way you move too.

1041
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:14,078
- They like the way they move.
- That's nice.

1042
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:20,181
I'm surprised George didn't tell you
his side of things.

1043
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:22,653
- Well, he didn't.
- That surprises me.

1044
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:24,658
- Does it?
- Aren't they cute?

1045
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:26,558
He usually does when he can.

1046
01:11:26,765 --> 01:11:28,323
I don't think he trusts me.

1047
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:32,868
It's really a very sad story.

1048
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:36,705
It would make you weep.

1049
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:39,101
You have ugly talents, Martha.

1050
01:11:39,311 --> 01:11:40,778
Is that so?

1051
01:11:41,981 --> 01:11:43,039
Don't encourage her.

1052
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:44,709
Encourage me.

1053
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:46,650
I warned you, don't encourage her!

1054
01:11:46,852 --> 01:11:48,080
He warned you.

1055
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:52,387
- Don't encourage me.
- I heard him. Tell me more.

1056
01:11:57,296 --> 01:12:00,060
Georgie-boy had lots of big ambitions...

1057
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:03,027
...in spite of something funny
in his past...

1058
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:06,170
...which Georgie-boy here
turned into a novel.

1059
01:12:06,372 --> 01:12:10,001
His first attempt and also his last!

1060
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,002
I rhymed!

1061
01:12:15,047 --> 01:12:16,173
I warn you!

1062
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:20,908
But Daddy took a look
at Georgie's novel.

1063
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,088
You're looking for a punch in the mouth.

1064
01:12:23,288 --> 01:12:24,414
Do tell!

1065
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:27,357
And he was very shocked by what he read.

1066
01:12:27,559 --> 01:12:29,424
- He was?
- Yes, he was.

1067
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,697
A novel all about a naughty boy-child.

1068
01:12:32,998 --> 01:12:34,226
I will not tolerate this!

1069
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:35,627
Oh, can it!

1070
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:38,592
A naughty boy-child...

1071
01:12:39,004 --> 01:12:42,371
...who killed his mother...

1072
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,936
...and his father dead!

1073
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:47,100
Stop it!

1074
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:51,412
And Daddy said, Look here...

1075
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:55,178
... I will not let you
publish such a thing! 

1076
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,819
The dancing's over!

1077
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:58,453
Violence!

1078
01:12:58,957 --> 01:12:59,946
And Daddy said...

1079
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:04,786
...You don't think I'm going to
let you publish this kind of crap? 

1080
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,792
Not on your life,
not while you're teaching here.

1081
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:11,625
You publish that
and you're out on your ass! 

1082
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,631
Desist! Desist!

1083
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,297
I will not be made mock of.

1084
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:19,634
He will not be made mock of,
for cripes sake!

1085
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:21,138
The game is over!

1086
01:13:21,513 --> 01:13:23,037
Just imagine...

1087
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:27,475
...a book all about a boy who murders
his mother and kills his father...

1088
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:30,477
...and pretends it's all an accident.

1089
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:32,682
Hey, wait a minute!

1090
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:34,989
You want to know the clincher?

1091
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:38,319
You want to know what
big brave Georgie said to Daddy?

1092
01:13:41,433 --> 01:13:43,162
But Daddy...

1093
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:47,169
I mean, But, Sir, this isn't
a novel at all.

1094
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:48,495
You will not say this!

1095
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,001
The hell, I won't! Keep away!

1096
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:52,333
No, sir, this is no novel at all.

1097
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:55,943
This is the truth.
This really happened to me! 

1098
01:13:56,148 --> 01:13:58,514
- I'll kill you.
- It happened!

1099
01:14:02,154 --> 01:14:03,086
Violence!

1100
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:15,264
Very quiet now.

1101
01:14:16,168 --> 01:14:17,533
We'll all be...

1102
01:14:17,903 --> 01:14:19,200
...very quiet.

1103
01:14:23,575 --> 01:14:24,405
Murderer!

1104
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:27,701
What's the trouble in here?

1105
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:31,213
Nothing. No trouble,
just playing a game.

1106
01:14:33,185 --> 01:14:34,652
Well, we're closing.

1107
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,115
One more round.

1108
01:14:36,321 --> 01:14:37,515
Same for everybody.

1109
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,385
Give us one more round
and we'll be on our merry way.

1110
01:14:40,626 --> 01:14:42,719
All right? Good!

1111
01:14:42,928 --> 01:14:43,860
Thanks.

1112
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:51,562
Well, that's one game.
What shall we do now?

1113
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:58,400
Let's do something else. We played
Humiliate the Host, what'll we do now?

1114
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,178
Oh, look!

1115
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,139
We must know other games,
us college types.

1116
01:15:04,349 --> 01:15:07,182
- Can't be the limit of our vocabulary.
- Haven't had enough?

1117
01:15:07,386 --> 01:15:08,751
There are other games.

1118
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:10,615
How about...

1119
01:15:11,123 --> 01:15:13,956
How about Hump the Hostess?

1120
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:17,759
Want to play that one? Do you want
to play Hump the Hostess?

1121
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:20,928
Or do you want to wait till later,
off in the bushes?

1122
01:15:21,233 --> 01:15:22,257
Hump the Hostess!

1123
01:15:22,467 --> 01:15:23,456
Will you shut up?

1124
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:43,451
You want to save that for later.
What shall we play now?

1125
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:46,952
- Portrait of a Man Drowning.
- I'm not drowning.

1126
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:49,927
- You told me to shut up.
- I'm sorry.

1127
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:50,924
I'm sorry!

1128
01:15:52,731 --> 01:15:53,959
I know what we do.

1129
01:15:54,166 --> 01:15:57,329
Now that we've done this round
of Humiliate the Host...

1130
01:15:57,669 --> 01:15:59,830
...and don't want to play
Hump the Hostess yet.

1131
01:16:00,172 --> 01:16:03,335
I know what! How about a little round
of Get the Guests?

1132
01:16:03,675 --> 01:16:05,836
How about that? Get the Guests?

1133
01:16:06,845 --> 01:16:08,506
Book dropper, child mentioner!

1134
01:16:08,847 --> 01:16:09,677
I don't like these games.

1135
01:16:10,015 --> 01:16:14,179
We've only had one game, we've got to
have another. You can't fly on one.

1136
01:16:14,519 --> 01:16:15,451
Silence!

1137
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:17,951
How will we play Get the Guests?

1138
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:19,180
You be quiet!

1139
01:16:19,424 --> 01:16:21,153
I wonder.

1140
01:16:26,698 --> 01:16:30,532
Martha, in her indiscreet way,
told you all about my first novel.

1141
01:16:30,736 --> 01:16:32,863
True or false that there
was such a thing.

1142
01:16:33,205 --> 01:16:36,174
She told you about my first novel,
my memory book.

1143
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:38,866
I preferred she hadn't, but
that's blood under the bridge.

1144
01:16:39,211 --> 01:16:41,702
But what Martha didn't tell you...

1145
01:16:42,047 --> 01:16:45,039
...what Martha didn't tell at all about
was my second novel.

1146
01:16:45,384 --> 01:16:48,547
You didn't know about that, did you?
True or false?

1147
01:16:50,055 --> 01:16:52,888
Well, it's an allegory really, probably.

1148
01:16:53,225 --> 01:16:56,558
It's about a nice young couple
who comes out of the Middle West.

1149
01:16:57,062 --> 01:16:58,393
It's a bucolic, you see.

1150
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:01,392
This nice young couple
comes out of the Middle West.

1151
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,568
He's blond and he's about thirty.

1152
01:17:03,902 --> 01:17:07,394
And he's a scientist,
a teacher, a scientist.

1153
01:17:07,739 --> 01:17:11,800
- His mouse, wifey, gargles brandy...
- Just a minute here!

1154
01:17:12,077 --> 01:17:14,307
This is my game!
You've had your game!

1155
01:17:14,513 --> 01:17:16,242
I want to hear. I love stories.

1156
01:17:16,448 --> 01:17:18,416
Mousie's father was a holy man, see?

1157
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:22,743
He ran a traveling clip joint and he
took the faithful, just took them.

1158
01:17:23,088 --> 01:17:25,386
- This is familiar.
- No kidding.

1159
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:29,253
Anyway, Blondie and his frau
out of the Plains States came.

1160
01:17:29,928 --> 01:17:31,589
Very funny, George.

1161
01:17:32,164 --> 01:17:32,823
Thank you.

1162
01:17:33,098 --> 01:17:35,362
They settled in a town
like Nouveau Carthage.

1163
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:37,398
- I don't think you should go on.
- Do you not?

1164
01:17:37,602 --> 01:17:39,433
I love familiar stories.
They're the best.

1165
01:17:39,771 --> 01:17:43,104
How right you are! But Blondie
was all in disguise as a teacher...

1166
01:17:43,442 --> 01:17:47,742
...because his baggage ticket had
bigger things writ on it. H.I.!

1167
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,770
Historical Inevitability.

1168
01:17:50,115 --> 01:17:52,777
- There's no reason to go further.
- Let them go on.

1169
01:17:53,452 --> 01:17:57,445
He had this baggage, and part of his
baggage was in the form of his mouse.

1170
01:17:57,789 --> 01:17:59,051
We don't have to listen.

1171
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:00,815
- Why not?
- She has a point.

1172
01:18:01,059 --> 01:18:03,789
Nobody could figure out
Blondie's baggage, his mouse.

1173
01:18:04,129 --> 01:18:07,792
I mean, here he was pan-Kansas
swimming champion or something...

1174
01:18:08,133 --> 01:18:09,293
...and he had this mouse.

1175
01:18:09,634 --> 01:18:13,297
Of whom he was solicitous to a point
that faileth human understanding...

1176
01:18:13,638 --> 01:18:15,799
...given that she was
something of a simp.

1177
01:18:16,141 --> 01:18:17,472
This just isn't fair of you.

1178
01:18:17,809 --> 01:18:20,710
Perhaps not. His mouse
tooted brandy immodestly...

1179
01:18:20,912 --> 01:18:23,437
...and spent half her time
in the upchuck.

1180
01:18:23,648 --> 01:18:25,115
- I know these people.
- Do you?

1181
01:18:25,317 --> 01:18:27,649
But she was money baggage
among other things.

1182
01:18:27,986 --> 01:18:32,616
Godly money from the golden teeth of the
unfaithful and she was put up with!

1183
01:18:32,824 --> 01:18:35,952
- I don't like this story.
- And she was put up with!

1184
01:18:36,161 --> 01:18:37,093
Stop? Hah!

1185
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:39,786
- Please, please, don't.
- Beg, baby!

1186
01:18:40,832 --> 01:18:43,858
- Flashback to How they got married.
- No!

1187
01:18:44,336 --> 01:18:46,668
- Why?
- How they got married was this.

1188
01:18:47,172 --> 01:18:49,367
The mouse got all puffed up one day...

1189
01:18:50,175 --> 01:18:54,009
...and she went over to Blondie's house
and stuck out her puff...

1190
01:18:54,346 --> 01:18:55,677
...and she said, Look at me.

1191
01:18:56,014 --> 01:18:57,003
I don't like this.

1192
01:18:57,349 --> 01:19:01,683
Look at me, I'm all puffed up.
Oh, my goodness, said Blondie.

1193
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:03,851
And so they were married.

1194
01:19:05,624 --> 01:19:06,750
And then what?

1195
01:19:07,025 --> 01:19:10,688
And then the puff went away again
like magic. Poof!

1196
01:19:13,532 --> 01:19:14,692
The puff went away?

1197
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:20,696
Honey, I didn't mean to. Honestly.

1198
01:19:24,209 --> 01:19:26,575
You shouldn't have told them!

1199
01:19:26,778 --> 01:19:29,770
No! You couldn't have told them!

1200
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:33,077
And that's how you play Get the Guests.

1201
01:19:34,386 --> 01:19:36,718
Oh, please! I'm going to be sick!

1202
01:19:44,095 --> 01:19:46,063
You shouldn't have done that.

1203
01:19:46,598 --> 01:19:48,896
- I hate hypocrisy.
- That was cruel and vicious.

1204
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,034
She'll get over it. She'll recover.

1205
01:19:51,236 --> 01:19:52,794
- And damaging to me.
- To you!

1206
01:19:53,004 --> 01:19:53,800
To me!

1207
01:19:56,775 --> 01:20:01,269
Beautiful. You got to have a swine
to show you where the truffles are.

1208
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:05,108
Rearrange your alliances.
Make the best of things.

1209
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:06,883
Put your wife in the car.

1210
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:09,619
I've had enough rides tonight.
We'll walk.

1211
01:20:09,955 --> 01:20:11,946
Right, you go plan some new strategy.

1212
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:15,185
You'll regret this.

1213
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:16,985
No doubt. I regret everything.

1214
01:20:17,462 --> 01:20:19,430
No, I mean I'll make you regret this.

1215
01:20:19,631 --> 01:20:20,461
Clean up the mess.

1216
01:20:20,966 --> 01:20:21,955
You just wait.

1217
01:20:23,635 --> 01:20:25,398
- Very good, George.
- Thank you.

1218
01:20:25,637 --> 01:20:27,935
- Really good!
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1219
01:20:28,139 --> 01:20:32,667
I mean, you did a good job.
You really fixed it.

1220
01:20:34,312 --> 01:20:36,803
That's the most life you've shown
in a long time.

1221
01:20:37,148 --> 01:20:38,479
You bring out the best in me.

1222
01:20:42,487 --> 01:20:44,318
You really are a bastard!

1223
01:20:44,656 --> 01:20:47,147
You can go around like
a hopped-up Arab...

1224
01:20:47,993 --> 01:20:51,156
...slashing at everything,
scarring up half the world...

1225
01:20:51,463 --> 01:20:54,057
...but let somebody else try it?
Oh no!

1226
01:20:54,332 --> 01:20:58,496
Why, baby, I did it all for you!
I thought you'd like it, sweetheart.

1227
01:20:59,337 --> 01:21:01,828
It's to your taste,
blood, carnage and all.

1228
01:21:02,407 --> 01:21:04,500
I thought you'd sort of get excited.

1229
01:21:04,843 --> 01:21:08,176
Heave and pant and come running at me,
your melons bobbling...

1230
01:21:08,513 --> 01:21:10,845
You have really screwed up, George.

1231
01:21:11,516 --> 01:21:13,177
I mean it! You really have!

1232
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:16,181
You can sit,
gin running from your mouth...

1233
01:21:16,521 --> 01:21:20,514
...you can humiliate me, tear me to
pieces all night, it's perfectly okay.

1234
01:21:20,859 --> 01:21:22,019
You can stand it!

1235
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,349
I cannot stand it!

1236
01:21:23,695 --> 01:21:26,528
You can stand it!
You married me for it!

1237
01:21:29,534 --> 01:21:31,365
That's a desperately sick lie.

1238
01:21:31,703 --> 01:21:33,694
Don't you know it even yet?

1239
01:21:37,042 --> 01:21:39,374
My arm's gotten tired whipping you.

1240
01:21:40,378 --> 01:21:42,869
- Year after year!
- Deluded, Martha.

1241
01:21:43,214 --> 01:21:44,203
It's not what I wanted.

1242
01:21:44,549 --> 01:21:47,211
I thought at least you were onto
yourself. I didn't know.

1243
01:21:47,886 --> 01:21:49,217
No. You're sick!

1244
01:21:51,056 --> 01:21:53,684
I'll show you who's sick!

1245
01:22:08,907 --> 01:22:12,240
You really are having
a field day, aren't you?

1246
01:22:13,912 --> 01:22:17,245
Well, I'm gonna finish you
before I'm through with you.

1247
01:22:17,749 --> 01:22:20,741
You and that quarterback?
You both going to finish me?

1248
01:22:20,952 --> 01:22:25,252
Before I'm through with you you'll
wish you'd died in that automobile!

1249
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:27,922
You'll wish you'd never mentioned
our son.

1250
01:22:28,226 --> 01:22:28,954
I warned you.

1251
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:31,594
- I'm impressed!
- I warned you not to go too far!

1252
01:22:31,796 --> 01:22:34,026
I'm just beginning!

1253
01:22:34,599 --> 01:22:37,762
I'm numbed so I can take you
when we're alone. I don't listen.

1254
01:22:38,436 --> 01:22:42,930
And if I do listen I sift it so I don't
really hear, which is the only way.

1255
01:22:44,275 --> 01:22:46,766
But you've taken a new tack
in the last century...

1256
01:22:47,112 --> 01:22:50,445
...which is just too much. Too much!

1257
01:22:52,283 --> 01:22:56,447
I don't mind your dirty underthings in
public. I do, but I'm reconciled to it.

1258
01:22:56,955 --> 01:23:00,118
You've moved into your own
fantasy world! You don't know...

1259
01:23:00,959 --> 01:23:02,290
- You have!
- Nuts!

1260
01:23:02,627 --> 01:23:03,787
You can go on...

1261
01:23:04,129 --> 01:23:08,463
Have you ever listened to your
sentences? You're so convoluted.

1262
01:23:09,134 --> 01:23:11,466
You talk like one of your stupid papers.

1263
01:23:11,803 --> 01:23:14,966
Actually, I'm rather worried about you.
About your mind.

1264
01:23:15,306 --> 01:23:17,797
Don't you worry
about my mind, sweetheart!

1265
01:23:18,143 --> 01:23:19,132
I'll commit you.

1266
01:23:19,644 --> 01:23:20,576
You what?

1267
01:23:20,979 --> 01:23:22,970
I think I'll have you committed.

1268
01:23:26,818 --> 01:23:28,979
Baby, aren't you something?

1269
01:23:29,654 --> 01:23:31,485
I've got to find a way to get at you.

1270
01:23:31,823 --> 01:23:35,315
You've got at me, you don't have to
do anything, George.

1271
01:23:35,994 --> 01:23:38,326
A thousand years of you
has been enough!

1272
01:23:38,663 --> 01:23:39,652
You'll go quietly then?

1273
01:23:41,166 --> 01:23:44,658
Do you want to know what's
really happened?

1274
01:23:45,503 --> 01:23:49,496
It snapped! Finally. Not me, it!
The whole arrangement.

1275
01:23:50,175 --> 01:23:53,338
You can go on forever and ever,
everything is manageable.

1276
01:23:53,678 --> 01:23:57,512
You make all sorts of excuses:
To hell with it, this is life.

1277
01:23:57,749 --> 01:24:00,013
Maybe tomorrow he'll be dead.
Maybe tomorrow you'll be dead.

1278
01:24:00,552 --> 01:24:02,019
All sorts of excuses.

1279
01:24:02,887 --> 01:24:04,582
Then one day...

1280
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:07,417
...one night, something happens...

1281
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,150
...and snap!

1282
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,693
It breaks and you just don't
give a damn anymore!

1283
01:24:14,699 --> 01:24:17,691
I tried with you, baby. I really tried.

1284
01:24:18,536 --> 01:24:19,696
Come off it.

1285
01:24:23,541 --> 01:24:25,372
You're a monster. You are.

1286
01:24:26,745 --> 01:24:28,542
I'm loud, and I'm vulgar...

1287
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,043
...and I wear the pants in the house
because somebody's got to!

1288
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,051
But I am not a monster!

1289
01:24:36,054 --> 01:24:37,043
I'm not!

1290
01:24:37,388 --> 01:24:41,290
You're a spoiled, self-indulgent,
dirty-minded, liquor-riddled...

1291
01:24:41,593 --> 01:24:43,720
Snap! It went snap.

1292
01:24:44,395 --> 01:24:46,886
I won't try to get through
to you any more.

1293
01:24:48,066 --> 01:24:51,001
There was a second back there,
when I could've...

1294
01:24:51,236 --> 01:24:52,726
...gotten through to you.

1295
01:24:53,371 --> 01:24:56,738
When maybe we could've out
through all this crap!

1296
01:24:57,909 --> 01:25:01,572
But it's past.
And I'm not going to try.

1297
01:25:01,913 --> 01:25:04,746
Once a month, Martha.
I've gotten used to it.

1298
01:25:05,316 --> 01:25:10,049
We get Misunderstood Martha, the
good-hearted girl beneath the barnacles.

1299
01:25:10,255 --> 01:25:13,588
The little miss that a touch of kindness
will bring to bloom again.

1300
01:25:14,759 --> 01:25:18,422
I believed it more times than I'd admit.
I'm that much of a sucker.

1301
01:25:19,097 --> 01:25:21,759
But I don't believe you,
I just don't believe you!

1302
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:25,934
There is no moment any more
when we could come together.

1303
01:25:26,271 --> 01:25:29,934
You can't come together with nothing.
And you're nothing!

1304
01:25:30,441 --> 01:25:31,430
Snap!

1305
01:25:33,111 --> 01:25:35,773
I looked at you tonight
and you weren't there!

1306
01:25:37,282 --> 01:25:41,616
It finally snapped.
And I'm gonna howl it out!

1307
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,610
I won't give a damn what I do.

1308
01:25:43,955 --> 01:25:47,447
And I'll make the biggest goddamn
explosion you've ever heard!

1309
01:25:48,126 --> 01:25:49,923
And I'll beat you at your own game.

1310
01:25:50,295 --> 01:25:53,093
- Is that a threat, George?
- That's a threat, Martha.

1311
01:25:53,298 --> 01:25:54,663
You're going to get it, baby!

1312
01:25:54,866 --> 01:25:57,130
Be careful, I'll rip you to pieces.

1313
01:25:57,502 --> 01:26:00,630
You are not man enough.
You haven't the guts!

1314
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:03,129
Total war?

1315
01:26:03,942 --> 01:26:05,239
Total!

1316
01:30:16,127 --> 01:30:16,957
Bells.

1317
01:30:21,466 --> 01:30:23,957
I've been hearing bells!

1318
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:26,801
Bells ringing.

1319
01:30:37,648 --> 01:30:39,809
And I couldn't sleep for the bells.

1320
01:30:43,754 --> 01:30:45,381
That woke me up.

1321
01:30:45,823 --> 01:30:47,017
What time is it?

1322
01:30:47,758 --> 01:30:49,191
Don't bother me.

1323
01:30:52,997 --> 01:30:54,328
I was asleep.

1324
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:58,162
And I was dreaming of something...

1325
01:30:58,836 --> 01:30:59,996
...and I heard the sounds coming...

1326
01:31:00,271 --> 01:31:02,637
...and I didn't know what it was...

1327
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:05,474
...and it frightened me.

1328
01:31:06,177 --> 01:31:08,008
I'm going to get you, Martha.

1329
01:31:10,014 --> 01:31:11,504
Somehow, Martha.

1330
01:31:12,683 --> 01:31:16,847
And there was someone there and...
I didn't want someone there.

1331
01:31:17,355 --> 01:31:19,016
I was naked.

1332
01:31:19,357 --> 01:31:21,188
You don't know what's going on, do you?

1333
01:31:22,226 --> 01:31:23,921
I don't want to know.

1334
01:31:25,029 --> 01:31:26,360
Listen to them!

1335
01:31:26,931 --> 01:31:28,694
- I don't want to!
- Look at them!

1336
01:31:33,371 --> 01:31:35,032
I don't want any children.

1337
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:38,235
I don't want any children, please!

1338
01:31:39,210 --> 01:31:42,702
I'm afraid. I don't want to be hurt.

1339
01:31:45,216 --> 01:31:46,877
I should have known.

1340
01:31:48,052 --> 01:31:50,543
Does that stud you married
know about that?

1341
01:31:51,556 --> 01:31:54,719
How do you make your
secret little murders? Pills?

1342
01:31:55,059 --> 01:31:58,051
You got a secret supply of pills?
Apple jelly? Willpower?

1343
01:31:58,396 --> 01:31:59,294
Going to throw up?

1344
01:31:59,497 --> 01:32:01,658
Where is he? I want my husband!
I want a drink!

1345
01:32:01,866 --> 01:32:03,891
That's right, go at it!

1346
01:32:04,735 --> 01:32:06,896
You know what's going on there?

1347
01:32:08,906 --> 01:32:12,899
I don't want to know anything.
You leave me alone.

1348
01:32:14,912 --> 01:32:15,810
Who rang?

1349
01:32:16,747 --> 01:32:18,237
What were the bells? Who rang?

1350
01:32:18,583 --> 01:32:20,380
He's up there and you ask who rang?

1351
01:32:20,585 --> 01:32:22,018
Someone rang!

1352
01:32:26,357 --> 01:32:27,722
Someone rang.

1353
01:32:30,761 --> 01:32:32,786
The bells rang and it was someone...

1354
01:32:32,997 --> 01:32:34,157
Somebody.

1355
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,433
Somebody rang.
The bells rang and it was somebody...

1356
01:32:43,608 --> 01:32:44,632
I've got it!

1357
01:32:45,710 --> 01:32:47,337
I've got it, Martha!

1358
01:32:47,945 --> 01:32:50,379
It was a message. The message was...

1359
01:32:50,615 --> 01:32:53,948
...our son... it was a message...
The bells rang...

1360
01:32:54,151 --> 01:32:56,312
...and it was a message.
And it was about...

1361
01:32:56,954 --> 01:32:58,387
...our son...

1362
01:32:58,623 --> 01:33:00,352
And the message was...

1363
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,587
...our son...

1364
01:33:04,929 --> 01:33:07,124
...is dead!

1365
01:33:07,331 --> 01:33:10,164
Our son is dead
and I haven't told Martha!

1366
01:33:10,468 --> 01:33:13,631
Our son is dead, Martha doesn't know,
and you won't tell her!

1367
01:33:16,474 --> 01:33:19,807
I'll tell her myself.
In good time I'll tell her myself.

1368
01:33:20,144 --> 01:33:21,475
I'm going to be sick.

1369
01:33:22,146 --> 01:33:23,443
Are you? That's nice.

1370
01:33:23,648 --> 01:33:26,981
- I'm going to die.
- Good, go right ahead.

1371
01:33:35,993 --> 01:33:37,517
Martha, I have some...

1372
01:33:38,195 --> 01:33:39,662
...terrible news.

1373
01:33:41,832 --> 01:33:43,424
It's about our son.

1374
01:33:45,436 --> 01:33:46,494
He's dead.

1375
01:33:49,173 --> 01:33:50,697
Do you hear me, Martha?

1376
01:33:52,843 --> 01:33:54,538
Our boy is dead.

1377
01:34:46,897 --> 01:34:49,388
Where the hell is everybody?

1378
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:50,624
I'll give you bastards five to come from
wherever you're hiding!

1379
01:37:06,370 --> 01:37:08,702
By God, you've gone crazy too.

1380
01:37:11,041 --> 01:37:13,532
I said you've gone crazy too.

1381
01:37:17,214 --> 01:37:18,545
Probably.

1382
01:37:21,285 --> 01:37:22,650
You've all gone crazy.

1383
01:37:24,255 --> 01:37:26,246
I come downstairs and what happens?

1384
01:37:34,798 --> 01:37:36,265
What happens?

1385
01:37:40,738 --> 01:37:44,538
My wife's in the can with
a liquor bottle and she winks at me.

1386
01:37:45,743 --> 01:37:47,074
Winks at me!

1387
01:37:48,245 --> 01:37:50,076
She's never winked at you?

1388
01:37:51,081 --> 01:37:52,912
What a shame!

1389
01:37:53,918 --> 01:37:57,410
She's lying down on the floor,
on the tiles, all curled-up...

1390
01:37:59,089 --> 01:38:02,525
...and she starts peeling
the label on the brandy bottle.

1391
01:38:02,726 --> 01:38:05,593
Maybe she'd be
more comfortable in the tub.

1392
01:38:08,599 --> 01:38:11,261
And I asked her what she's doing
and she goes...

1393
01:38:11,602 --> 01:38:14,093
...Sshh, nobody knows I'm here.

1394
01:38:16,774 --> 01:38:18,765
And I come down here...

1395
01:38:19,109 --> 01:38:23,603
...and you're stumbling around going
clink, for God's sake, clink.

1396
01:38:26,951 --> 01:38:28,782
You've all gone crazy.

1397
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:32,288
Sad but true.

1398
01:38:33,791 --> 01:38:35,622
Where is your husband?

1399
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:38,793
He is vanished.

1400
01:38:44,802 --> 01:38:46,565
You're all crazy.

1401
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:48,396
Nuts!

1402
01:38:49,139 --> 01:38:52,973
'Tis the refuge we take
when the unreality of the world...

1403
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:55,642
...sits too heavy on our tiny heads.

1404
01:38:57,815 --> 01:39:01,808
Relax! Sink into it. You're no better
than anybody else.

1405
01:39:03,487 --> 01:39:04,818
I think I am.

1406
01:39:10,628 --> 01:39:14,155
You're certainly a flop
in some departments.

1407
01:39:23,507 --> 01:39:24,667
What'd you say?

1408
01:39:26,677 --> 01:39:29,168
I said you're a flop
in some departments.

1409
01:39:29,513 --> 01:39:31,174
I'm sorry you're disappointed.

1410
01:39:31,849 --> 01:39:34,340
Maybe some time
when I didn't drink for ten hours.

1411
01:39:35,519 --> 01:39:38,181
Baby, you sure are a flop!

1412
01:39:39,356 --> 01:39:42,348
You're something. You know that?
You're really something!

1413
01:39:45,129 --> 01:39:47,029
To you, everybody's a flop!

1414
01:39:47,364 --> 01:39:48,854
Your husband's a flop, I'm a flop.

1415
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:50,188
You're all flops.

1416
01:39:50,534 --> 01:39:54,368
I am the Earth Mother
and you are all flops.

1417
01:39:59,543 --> 01:40:01,534
I disgust me.

1418
01:40:09,053 --> 01:40:12,545
There's only been one man in my life
who's ever made me happy.

1419
01:40:14,725 --> 01:40:16,556
You know that? One.

1420
01:40:17,227 --> 01:40:19,058
The gym instructor or something?

1421
01:40:22,399 --> 01:40:23,331
George.

1422
01:40:26,403 --> 01:40:27,734
My husband.

1423
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:29,398
You're kidding?

1424
01:40:30,574 --> 01:40:32,405
You must be. Him?

1425
01:40:35,913 --> 01:40:37,244
You don't believe it.

1426
01:40:37,581 --> 01:40:38,912
Why, of course I do.

1427
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:41,247
You always deal on appearances?

1428
01:40:41,518 --> 01:40:42,746
For God's sake!

1429
01:40:44,254 --> 01:40:47,917
George who is out
somewhere there in the dark.

1430
01:40:49,259 --> 01:40:52,092
Who is good to me. Whom I revile.

1431
01:40:53,597 --> 01:40:58,261
Who can keep learning the games we play
as quickly as I can change them.

1432
01:40:58,936 --> 01:41:02,099
Who can make me happy
and I do not wish to be happy.

1433
01:41:02,439 --> 01:41:05,101
Yes, I do wish to be happy.

1434
01:41:07,377 --> 01:41:09,368
George and Martha.

1435
01:41:10,447 --> 01:41:12,608
Sad, sad, sad.

1436
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:17,952
Whom I will not forgive
for having come to rest.

1437
01:41:18,622 --> 01:41:20,954
For having seen me and having said...

1438
01:41:21,959 --> 01:41:24,450
...Yes, this will do.

1439
01:41:25,629 --> 01:41:29,121
Who has made the hideous, the hurting...

1440
01:41:29,466 --> 01:41:33,960
...the insulting mistake of loving me.

1441
01:41:34,805 --> 01:41:36,636
And must be punished for it.

1442
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:45,312
Sad, sad, sad.

1443
01:41:49,153 --> 01:41:50,142
Some day...

1444
01:41:52,322 --> 01:41:53,482
...some night...

1445
01:41:53,824 --> 01:41:58,158
...some stupid liquor-ridden night
I will go too far.

1446
01:41:59,496 --> 01:42:03,489
I'll either break his back or I'll
push him off for good, which I deserve.

1447
01:42:04,835 --> 01:42:06,826
I don't think he's got
a vertebrae intact.

1448
01:42:08,338 --> 01:42:11,034
Oh, you don't?

1449
01:42:11,241 --> 01:42:12,936
You don't think so?

1450
01:42:13,844 --> 01:42:15,334
Oh, little boy!

1451
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:19,672
You've got yourself so hunched over
your microphone...

1452
01:42:20,017 --> 01:42:21,348
Microscope!

1453
01:42:21,685 --> 01:42:24,017
Yes. And you don't
see anything, do you?

1454
01:42:24,354 --> 01:42:27,016
You see everything
but the goddamn mind.

1455
01:42:27,357 --> 01:42:31,691
You see all the specks and the crap,
but you don't see what goes on, do you?

1456
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:37,023
You know so little. And you're going
to take over the world, huh?

1457
01:42:37,534 --> 01:42:39,024
I said, all right!

1458
01:42:41,038 --> 01:42:43,029
The stallion's mad, huh?

1459
01:42:43,373 --> 01:42:46,706
The gelding's getting all upset, huh?

1460
01:42:47,044 --> 01:42:49,035
You swing wild, don't you?

1461
01:42:49,379 --> 01:42:51,040
You poor little bastard!

1462
01:42:51,381 --> 01:42:52,712
Hit out at everything!

1463
01:42:53,383 --> 01:42:54,714
Go answer the door.

1464
01:42:56,386 --> 01:42:57,546
What'd you say to me?

1465
01:42:57,888 --> 01:43:00,379
I said go answer the door.
What are you, deaf?

1466
01:43:00,724 --> 01:43:02,885
You want me to go answer the door?

1467
01:43:03,227 --> 01:43:05,718
That's right, lunkhead,
go answer the door.

1468
01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:08,755
Or are you too drunk to do that, too?

1469
01:43:08,999 --> 01:43:10,523
There's no need for you to...

1470
01:43:10,734 --> 01:43:12,167
Answer it!

1471
01:43:12,769 --> 01:43:14,532
You be houseboy around here awhile.

1472
01:43:14,738 --> 01:43:16,729
You can start in
being houseboy right now.

1473
01:43:17,074 --> 01:43:18,735
Look, I'm no flunky to you.

1474
01:43:19,076 --> 01:43:21,567
Sure, you are!
You're ambitious, aren't you?

1475
01:43:21,912 --> 01:43:26,076
You didn't come back here with me
out of driven passion, did you?

1476
01:43:26,917 --> 01:43:29,750
You were thinking a little bit
about your career.

1477
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:35,081
You can just houseboy your way up
the ladder for awhile.

1478
01:43:36,927 --> 01:43:38,258
There's no limit to you, is there?

1479
01:43:38,595 --> 01:43:40,859
No, baby, none. Go answer the door.

1480
01:43:41,164 --> 01:43:42,631
Go on, git!

1481
01:43:44,935 --> 01:43:46,425
Aimless. Wanton.

1482
01:43:46,770 --> 01:43:48,931
Now, you just do as you're told.

1483
01:43:49,273 --> 01:43:51,764
You show ol' Martha
there's something you can do.

1484
01:43:52,109 --> 01:43:54,441
I'm coming, for Christ's sake!

1485
01:43:54,778 --> 01:43:56,439
Wonderful! Marvelous!

1486
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:59,544
Just a gigolo everywhere I go.

1487
01:43:59,783 --> 01:44:00,477
Stop that!

1488
01:44:01,118 --> 01:44:04,781
Sorry, baby. Now you go
answer the little door, huh?

1489
01:44:13,931 --> 01:44:15,831
How lovely!

1490
01:44:18,302 --> 01:44:21,794
Why, sonny, you came home
for your birthday at last!

1491
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:23,739
Get away from me!

1492
01:44:24,308 --> 01:44:27,141
That's the houseboy, for God's sake!

1493
01:44:27,477 --> 01:44:31,641
That's not our own little Sonny-Jim,
our own all-American something or other?

1494
01:44:31,982 --> 01:44:35,975
I certainly hope not.
He's been acting awful funny if he is.

1495
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,151
I'll bet. Chippie, chippie, huh?

1496
01:44:40,924 --> 01:44:42,915
I brung these flowers...

1497
01:44:45,262 --> 01:44:46,593
...'cause youse...

1498
01:44:47,397 --> 01:44:49,126
Aw, hell, Martha!

1499
01:44:50,934 --> 01:44:55,598
Pansies, rosemary, violence,
mah wedding bouquet!

1500
01:44:55,939 --> 01:44:57,600
If you don't mind, I'll get my wife...

1501
01:44:59,142 --> 01:45:02,270
You stay right where you are.
Make my hubby a drink.

1502
01:45:02,612 --> 01:45:03,943
I don't think I will.

1503
01:45:04,281 --> 01:45:08,615
No, Martha. That would be too much.
He's your houseboy, not mine.

1504
01:45:08,952 --> 01:45:10,943
I'm nobody's houseboy!

1505
01:45:12,956 --> 01:45:16,915
I'm nobody's houseboy now

1506
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:19,256
Vicious.

1507
01:45:19,463 --> 01:45:20,953
Children? That right?

1508
01:45:21,298 --> 01:45:25,462
Vicious children with their sad games
hopscotching their way through life?

1509
01:45:25,802 --> 01:45:26,962
Something like that.

1510
01:45:27,304 --> 01:45:28,134
Screw, baby.

1511
01:45:28,472 --> 01:45:31,464
Him can't! Him too full o' booze!

1512
01:45:31,808 --> 01:45:35,141
Really? Here! Dump these in some gin.

1513
01:45:37,848 --> 01:45:40,373
A terrible thing to do
to Martha's snapdragons!

1514
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:42,142
Is that what they are?

1515
01:45:42,486 --> 01:45:46,650
Yup. And I went by moonlight to Daddy's
greenhouse to pick them for her.

1516
01:45:46,990 --> 01:45:49,823
There is no moon.
I saw it go down from the bedroom.

1517
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:51,320
From the bedroom?

1518
01:45:53,497 --> 01:45:54,657
There is a moon.

1519
01:45:54,998 --> 01:45:57,489
There is no goddamn moon,
the moon went down.

1520
01:45:57,834 --> 01:45:59,495
That may be, Chastity,
but it came back up.

1521
01:45:59,703 --> 01:46:00,294
Bull!

1522
01:46:00,504 --> 01:46:03,735
Once when I was sailing past Majorca,
the moon went down...

1523
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:07,000
...thought about it awhile then,
pop, came up again.

1524
01:46:07,344 --> 01:46:10,177
That is not true. That is such a lie!

1525
01:46:10,514 --> 01:46:12,846
You must not call everything a lie.
Must she?

1526
01:46:13,350 --> 01:46:15,341
I don't know when you people are lying.

1527
01:46:16,019 --> 01:46:18,510
- You're damn right!
- You're not supposed to.

1528
01:46:20,123 --> 01:46:24,025
- So, I was sailing past Majorca...
- You never sailed past Majorca.

1529
01:46:24,528 --> 01:46:28,020
You were never in
the Mediterranean at all, ever!

1530
01:46:28,365 --> 01:46:31,357
My mom and dad took me
as a college graduation present.

1531
01:46:32,035 --> 01:46:33,195
After you killed them?

1532
01:46:34,771 --> 01:46:35,897
Maybe.

1533
01:46:37,374 --> 01:46:39,706
Yeah. And maybe not too.

1534
01:46:40,377 --> 01:46:41,309
Jesus!

1535
01:46:41,878 --> 01:46:45,541
Truth and illusion. Who knows
the difference, toots? Houseboy?

1536
01:46:45,882 --> 01:46:46,712
I'm not a houseboy.

1537
01:46:47,050 --> 01:46:50,349
You don't make it in the sack,
you're a houseboy.

1538
01:46:51,221 --> 01:46:52,984
Then you must have made it, yes?

1539
01:46:53,723 --> 01:46:58,057
Somebody's lying, not playing the
game straight. Who's lying? Martha?

1540
01:46:58,895 --> 01:47:00,385
Tell him I'm not a houseboy.

1541
01:47:02,365 --> 01:47:04,230
You're not a houseboy.

1542
01:47:08,405 --> 01:47:09,394
So be it.

1543
01:47:11,408 --> 01:47:14,241
Truth and illusion.
You don't know the difference.

1544
01:47:15,245 --> 01:47:17,736
No, but we must carry on
as though we did.

1545
01:47:18,915 --> 01:47:20,075
Amen.

1546
01:47:21,918 --> 01:47:23,078
Snap went the dragons.

1547
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:24,150
Thank you.

1548
01:47:25,055 --> 01:47:25,953
Skip it.

1549
01:47:26,256 --> 01:47:27,416
I said snap went the dragons!

1550
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:29,124
Yeah, we know.

1551
01:47:30,093 --> 01:47:31,082
Don't!

1552
01:47:31,428 --> 01:47:32,588
Don't do that.

1553
01:47:32,929 --> 01:47:33,759
Shut up, stud!

1554
01:47:34,097 --> 01:47:35,086
I'm not a stud.

1555
01:47:35,432 --> 01:47:37,423
Then you're a houseboy. Which is it?

1556
01:47:38,268 --> 01:47:39,929
Does it matter to you?

1557
01:47:40,770 --> 01:47:43,762
No, actually it doesn't.
Either way I've had it.

1558
01:47:44,608 --> 01:47:47,270
Stop throwing these damn things at me!

1559
01:47:47,611 --> 01:47:49,806
- Either way. Snap!
- Shall I do something to him?

1560
01:47:50,113 --> 01:47:51,444
You leave him alone!

1561
01:47:51,781 --> 01:47:54,113
Which are you, baby, houseboy or stud?

1562
01:47:56,620 --> 01:48:00,112
Truth or illusion, George?
Doesn't it matter to you at all?

1563
01:48:03,126 --> 01:48:05,788
Snap! You got your answer, baby.

1564
01:48:11,134 --> 01:48:11,964
Got it.

1565
01:48:16,473 --> 01:48:18,805
You just gird your
blue-veined loins, girl.

1566
01:48:19,309 --> 01:48:22,301
There's one more game to play.
It's called Bringing up Baby.

1567
01:48:23,647 --> 01:48:26,639
I don't want a fuss. Don't want
any scandal around here, do you?

1568
01:48:26,983 --> 01:48:28,814
Want to keep to your timetable?
Then sit!

1569
01:48:29,486 --> 01:48:34,150
And you, pretty miss, you like fun and
games! You're a sport from way back!

1570
01:48:34,491 --> 01:48:35,480
All right.

1571
01:48:35,825 --> 01:48:37,986
Good. But we're not all here.

1572
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:42,320
Your little wifelet isn't here.

1573
01:48:42,666 --> 01:48:43,997
She had a rough night...

1574
01:48:44,334 --> 01:48:47,667
We can't play without everybody.
We need your little wife.

1575
01:48:50,507 --> 01:48:51,496
Cut that!

1576
01:48:52,509 --> 01:48:55,842
Just get off your butt and bring
that little dip back in here!

1577
01:48:56,179 --> 01:48:59,171
Now be a good puppy, go fetch.
Fetch, good puppy.

1578
01:49:09,459 --> 01:49:10,619
One more game.

1579
01:49:19,135 --> 01:49:20,966
I don't like what's going to happen.

1580
01:49:21,471 --> 01:49:22,802
Do you know what it is?

1581
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:26,131
No. But I don't like it.

1582
01:49:26,476 --> 01:49:28,137
Maybe you will, Martha.

1583
01:49:29,479 --> 01:49:31,310
It's a real fun game.

1584
01:49:31,648 --> 01:49:32,979
No more games.

1585
01:49:33,316 --> 01:49:37,150
One more, Martha. One more game
and then beddie-bye.

1586
01:49:37,487 --> 01:49:41,821
Everybody packs up his tools
and baggage and stuff and go home.

1587
01:49:42,158 --> 01:49:43,853
And you and me...

1588
01:49:44,394 --> 01:49:46,919
...we're going to climb
them well-worn stairs.

1589
01:49:47,163 --> 01:49:48,824
No, George, no.

1590
01:49:49,165 --> 01:49:50,496
Yes, baby.

1591
01:49:51,835 --> 01:49:53,996
It'll all be done before you know it.

1592
01:49:54,838 --> 01:49:56,829
No climb stairs with Georgie?

1593
01:49:57,173 --> 01:50:01,507
No more games. It's games I don't want.
No more games, please.

1594
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:05,679
Sure you do. Original game girl!
Of course you do.

1595
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:10,683
Don't you touch me!

1596
01:50:11,454 --> 01:50:13,149
Keep your paws clean
for the undergraduates.

1597
01:50:15,258 --> 01:50:16,247
Listen to me!

1598
01:50:16,493 --> 01:50:17,824
You've had an evening.

1599
01:50:18,028 --> 01:50:22,556
You can't stop when there's enough
blood in your mouth. We're going on.

1600
01:50:22,832 --> 01:50:26,529
I'm having at you, and your performance
will look like an Easter pageant.

1601
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:28,098
Get yourself alert.

1602
01:50:28,405 --> 01:50:29,895
- Get some life in you.
- Stop!

1603
01:50:30,106 --> 01:50:31,368
Pull yourself together!

1604
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:34,871
I'm going to knock you around
and I want you up for it!

1605
01:50:35,845 --> 01:50:37,005
What do you want?

1606
01:50:37,213 --> 01:50:39,044
- An equal battle.
- You'll get it.

1607
01:50:39,249 --> 01:50:41,717
- I want you mad.
- I'm mad. Don't worry about it!

1608
01:50:42,452 --> 01:50:44,545
Good girl!
We'll play to the death.

1609
01:50:44,754 --> 01:50:46,551
- Yours?
- You'll be surprised.

1610
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:48,221
Here come the tots. Be ready.

1611
01:50:48,558 --> 01:50:49,547
I'm ready for you.

1612
01:50:50,026 --> 01:50:52,358
Hip, hop. Hip, hip, hop.

1613
01:50:52,562 --> 01:50:54,723
Are you a bunny, honey!

1614
01:50:55,065 --> 01:50:57,295
- How's the bunny?
- Bunny funny!

1615
01:50:57,734 --> 01:50:59,224
Bunny funny. Good for bunny.

1616
01:50:59,736 --> 01:51:00,896
Honey funny bunny.

1617
01:51:03,073 --> 01:51:04,438
All right, here we go.

1618
01:51:04,708 --> 01:51:06,403
Last game. All sit.

1619
01:51:07,577 --> 01:51:11,377
- Sit down. This is a civilized game.
- Just get on with it.

1620
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:15,908
I think we've been having a real good
evening, all things considered.

1621
01:51:16,252 --> 01:51:19,085
We've got to know each other.
And we've had fun and games.

1622
01:51:19,923 --> 01:51:21,254
Like Curl Up On The Floor.

1623
01:51:21,458 --> 01:51:22,152
The Tiles.

1624
01:51:22,425 --> 01:51:23,858
The Tiles, Snap The Dragon.

1625
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:25,090
Peel the Label!

1626
01:51:26,262 --> 01:51:28,253
Label. Peel the Label.

1627
01:51:28,598 --> 01:51:30,088
I peel labels.

1628
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:32,268
We all peel labels, sweetie.

1629
01:51:32,602 --> 01:51:35,594
When you get through the skin,
and through the muscle...

1630
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:40,103
...and slosh aside the organs, down to
the bone, you know what you do?

1631
01:51:41,277 --> 01:51:42,938
When you get down to the bone...

1632
01:51:43,279 --> 01:51:45,770
...you aren't all the way.
Something's inside the bone.

1633
01:51:46,116 --> 01:51:48,277
The marrow.
That's what you got to get at.

1634
01:51:48,785 --> 01:51:51,948
But bones are pretty resilient,
especially in the young.

1635
01:51:52,288 --> 01:51:53,448
Now take our son...

1636
01:51:56,126 --> 01:51:58,117
Our son. Martha's and my little joy.

1637
01:52:00,230 --> 01:52:01,595
Just what are you doing?

1638
01:52:01,798 --> 01:52:04,198
- I'm talking about our son.
- Well, don't.

1639
01:52:04,634 --> 01:52:06,795
I want to.
It's important we talk about him.

1640
01:52:07,137 --> 01:52:10,129
You want to hear about our
bouncy boy, don't you?

1641
01:52:11,641 --> 01:52:13,632
Martha's and my son.

1642
01:52:16,146 --> 01:52:17,477
You have a child?

1643
01:52:17,814 --> 01:52:19,975
Yes indeed, do we ever!

1644
01:52:20,316 --> 01:52:21,806
Will you talk about him or shall I?

1645
01:52:22,018 --> 01:52:24,680
- Don't.
- All rightie, now let's see.

1646
01:52:24,888 --> 01:52:26,651
He's nice, despite home his life.

1647
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:30,824
Most kids would be neurotic,
Martha carrying on the way she does.

1648
01:52:31,161 --> 01:52:34,324
Sleeping till 4 p.m.
Climbing over the poor bastard...

1649
01:52:34,664 --> 01:52:39,158
...trying to break the bathroom door
to wash him in the tub when he's 16.

1650
01:52:39,669 --> 01:52:41,830
Dragging strangers
to the house all hours.

1651
01:52:43,673 --> 01:52:44,833
That's enough.

1652
01:52:45,175 --> 01:52:46,403
Do you want to take over?

1653
01:52:46,743 --> 01:52:49,337
Why would anyone want to
wash a 16 year-old?

1654
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:51,010
For Christ's sake!

1655
01:52:51,347 --> 01:52:52,439
Well, why?

1656
01:52:52,649 --> 01:52:54,173
Because it's her baby-poo.

1657
01:52:54,517 --> 01:52:55,677
All right.

1658
01:52:56,019 --> 01:52:59,011
Our son, you want our son?
You'll have it.

1659
01:53:01,858 --> 01:53:03,018
Do you want a drink?

1660
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:09,521
We don't have to hear it
if you don't want to.

1661
01:53:09,866 --> 01:53:12,357
Who says? You in a position
to set the rules?

1662
01:53:14,704 --> 01:53:16,194
Good boy. You'll go far.

1663
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,031
All right, your recitation please.

1664
01:53:25,014 --> 01:53:26,106
Our son...

1665
01:53:26,382 --> 01:53:27,314
All right!

1666
01:53:28,384 --> 01:53:29,544
Our son.

1667
01:53:32,055 --> 01:53:36,048
Our son was born in a September night,
a night not unlike tonight...

1668
01:53:38,061 --> 01:53:39,323
...though tomorrow...

1669
01:53:40,163 --> 01:53:41,926
...and sixteen years ago.

1670
01:53:42,131 --> 01:53:43,496
See, I told you.

1671
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:48,337
- It was an easy birth.
- No, you labored, how you labored!

1672
01:53:48,738 --> 01:53:50,228
It was an easy birth!

1673
01:53:51,074 --> 01:53:52,837
Once it had been...

1674
01:53:53,042 --> 01:53:54,407
...accepted.

1675
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:58,043
- Relaxed into.
- That's better.

1676
01:53:59,082 --> 01:54:02,415
It was an easy birth,
once it had been accepted.

1677
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:05,581
And I was young.

1678
01:54:05,922 --> 01:54:07,685
And he was healthy...

1679
01:54:08,758 --> 01:54:11,090
...a red, bawling child.

1680
01:54:11,594 --> 01:54:13,960
Martha thinks she saw him at delivery.

1681
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:16,591
With slippery, firm limbs.

1682
01:54:17,767 --> 01:54:21,601
And a full head of black, fine hair.

1683
01:54:22,772 --> 01:54:24,103
Which, later...

1684
01:54:24,774 --> 01:54:25,934
...later became...

1685
01:54:28,011 --> 01:54:29,444
...blond as the sun.

1686
01:54:31,114 --> 01:54:32,445
Our son.

1687
01:54:32,782 --> 01:54:34,113
He was a healthy child.

1688
01:54:35,618 --> 01:54:39,452
And I had wanted a child.
Oh, I had wanted a child!

1689
01:54:39,789 --> 01:54:41,450
A son? Daughter?

1690
01:54:41,791 --> 01:54:42,780
A child!

1691
01:54:47,797 --> 01:54:49,458
I had my child.

1692
01:54:49,799 --> 01:54:50,959
Our child.

1693
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:55,403
And we raised him.

1694
01:54:58,308 --> 01:55:00,299
Yes, we did. We raised him.

1695
01:55:03,646 --> 01:55:06,809
And he had green eyes.

1696
01:55:08,818 --> 01:55:12,481
Such green, green eyes.

1697
01:55:13,656 --> 01:55:15,487
Blue, green, brown.

1698
01:55:16,492 --> 01:55:18,187
And he loved the sun.

1699
01:55:18,494 --> 01:55:21,930
And he was tan
before and after everyone.

1700
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,592
And in the sun...

1701
01:55:26,502 --> 01:55:27,992
...his hair became...

1702
01:55:29,038 --> 01:55:30,130
...fleece.

1703
01:55:34,177 --> 01:55:37,169
Beautiful, beautiful boy.

1704
01:55:42,518 --> 01:55:45,351
So beautiful, so wise.

1705
01:55:45,855 --> 01:55:47,345
All truth being relative.

1706
01:55:48,358 --> 01:55:49,689
It was true.

1707
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:53,693
Beautiful, wise, perfect!

1708
01:55:53,896 --> 01:55:55,523
There's a real mother talking.

1709
01:55:55,832 --> 01:55:57,697
I want a child!

1710
01:55:59,369 --> 01:56:00,358
On principle?

1711
01:56:00,703 --> 01:56:03,194
I want a child. I want a baby.

1712
01:56:03,706 --> 01:56:05,867
This perfection could not last.

1713
01:56:06,876 --> 01:56:08,434
Not with George.

1714
01:56:09,646 --> 01:56:10,977
Not with George around.

1715
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:12,647
There, you see, I knew she'd shift.

1716
01:56:12,849 --> 01:56:14,510
- Be still!
- Sorry, Mother.

1717
01:56:14,717 --> 01:56:16,048
Can't you be still?

1718
01:56:16,886 --> 01:56:21,380
Not with George. A drowning man takes
down those nearest, and he tried.

1719
01:56:22,058 --> 01:56:25,050
And, God, how I fought him!
How I fought him!

1720
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:26,726
The one thing...

1721
01:56:27,063 --> 01:56:29,554
...I tried to carry unscathed
through the...

1722
01:56:30,566 --> 01:56:31,897
...sewer of our marriage...

1723
01:56:32,402 --> 01:56:36,065
...through the sick nights and the
pathetic, stupid days...

1724
01:56:36,406 --> 01:56:39,739
...through the derision and the
laughter. God, the laughter!

1725
01:56:41,077 --> 01:56:43,671
Through one failure after another.

1726
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:47,914
Each attempt more numbing,
more sickening than the one before.

1727
01:56:48,751 --> 01:56:52,084
The one thing, the one person
I tried to protect...

1728
01:56:52,755 --> 01:56:57,249
...to raise above the mire of this vile,
crushing marriage...

1729
01:56:58,094 --> 01:57:02,087
...the one light in all this
hopeless darkness! Our son!

1730
01:57:02,298 --> 01:57:02,821
Stop it!

1731
01:57:07,737 --> 01:57:09,204
Why, don't you like it?

1732
01:57:09,605 --> 01:57:10,970
You can't do this.

1733
01:57:11,174 --> 01:57:11,765
Who says?

1734
01:57:11,974 --> 01:57:14,272
- I say!
- Tell us why, baby.

1735
01:57:15,278 --> 01:57:16,768
Is this game over?

1736
01:57:19,282 --> 01:57:21,273
Oh, no! Not by a long shot.

1737
01:57:22,285 --> 01:57:25,118
I've got a surprise for you.
It's about sonny-Jim.

1738
01:57:27,123 --> 01:57:28,613
I'm running this show!

1739
01:57:29,625 --> 01:57:30,614
Sweetheart...

1740
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:34,090
...Im afraid I've got
some bad news for you.

1741
01:57:34,297 --> 01:57:36,629
For both of us, I mean.
Some rather sad news.

1742
01:57:37,567 --> 01:57:39,091
What is this?

1743
01:57:39,302 --> 01:57:43,295
Martha, while you were busy,
while the two of you were busy...

1744
01:57:43,639 --> 01:57:45,630
...I don't know where,
but you were somewhere...

1745
01:57:46,142 --> 01:57:47,973
...while you were busy for awhile...

1746
01:57:48,811 --> 01:57:51,507
...Missy and I
were having a little talk.

1747
01:57:51,714 --> 01:57:53,773
You know, a chaw and a talk.

1748
01:57:53,983 --> 01:57:55,746
And the doorbell rang.

1749
01:57:55,952 --> 01:57:56,976
Chimed.

1750
01:58:03,493 --> 01:58:04,824
It's hard for me to tell you.

1751
01:58:06,462 --> 01:58:07,759
Please don't!

1752
01:58:07,997 --> 01:58:08,986
Tell me!

1753
01:58:09,999 --> 01:58:13,992
It was good old Western Union,
some little boy about seventy.

1754
01:58:15,004 --> 01:58:15,936
Crazy Billy?

1755
01:58:16,339 --> 01:58:17,829
That's right. Crazy Billy.

1756
01:58:18,508 --> 01:58:20,999
And he had a telegram and it was for us.

1757
01:58:23,012 --> 01:58:24,172
I have to tell you about it.

1758
01:58:25,681 --> 01:58:30,015
Why did they bring it?
Why didn't they telephone it?

1759
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:35,184
There are some telegrams you have to
deliver, Martha. Some you cannot phone.

1760
01:58:36,492 --> 01:58:37,823
What do you mean?

1761
01:58:40,530 --> 01:58:42,191
I can hardly bring myself to say it.

1762
01:58:43,166 --> 01:58:44,292
You want to do it?

1763
01:58:50,039 --> 01:58:54,533
Well, Martha, I'm afraid our boy
isn't coming home for his birthday.

1764
01:58:55,378 --> 01:58:56,868
Of course he is!

1765
01:58:57,713 --> 01:58:59,374
Of course he is! I say he is!

1766
01:58:59,715 --> 01:59:00,545
He can't.

1767
01:59:04,921 --> 01:59:06,149
Our son...

1768
01:59:07,223 --> 01:59:08,212
...is...

1769
01:59:09,792 --> 01:59:10,486
...dead.

1770
01:59:12,228 --> 01:59:14,890
He was killed late in the afternoon...

1771
01:59:15,565 --> 01:59:17,829
...on a country road with his
learner's permit.

1772
01:59:18,034 --> 01:59:20,559
He swerved to avoid a porcupine
and drove...

1773
01:59:20,903 --> 01:59:22,063
You can't do that!

1774
01:59:23,072 --> 01:59:24,403
...into a large tree.

1775
01:59:25,541 --> 01:59:27,031
You cannot do that!

1776
01:59:28,711 --> 01:59:30,235
I thought you should know.

1777
01:59:31,981 --> 01:59:33,710
You cannot do that!

1778
01:59:34,050 --> 01:59:36,883
You can't decide these things
for yourself!

1779
01:59:37,553 --> 01:59:39,384
I will not let you do that!

1780
01:59:39,722 --> 01:59:41,383
Have to leave around noon, I suppose.

1781
01:59:41,724 --> 01:59:43,749
I won't let you decide these things.

1782
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:47,225
There are matters of identification,
arrangements to be made.

1783
01:59:47,563 --> 01:59:49,724
You can't do this! I won't let you!

1784
01:59:50,399 --> 01:59:53,232
- Get your hands off me!
- I haven't done anything!

1785
01:59:53,569 --> 01:59:55,867
Now you listen to me. Our son is dead!

1786
01:59:56,072 --> 01:59:57,733
Can you get that through your head?

1787
01:59:58,741 --> 02:00:03,075
Listen carefully. We got a telegram.
There was a car accident and he's dead!

1788
02:00:03,412 --> 02:00:06,074
Poof! Just like that!
Now how do you like it?

1789
02:00:10,253 --> 02:00:12,244
Let her go.
She'll be all right.

1790
02:00:23,432 --> 02:00:25,798
He is not dead.

1791
02:00:28,271 --> 02:00:29,260
He is dead.

1792
02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:36,942
You cannot decide.

1793
02:00:37,947 --> 02:00:39,437
He hasn't decided anything.

1794
02:00:39,782 --> 02:00:42,945
It's not his doing.
He doesn't have the power.

1795
02:00:43,286 --> 02:00:47,620
That's right. I'm no god. I have
no power over life and death, do I?

1796
02:00:49,492 --> 02:00:51,619
You can't kill him.

1797
02:00:52,028 --> 02:00:54,519
You can't let him die!

1798
02:00:59,435 --> 02:01:00,800
There was a telegram.

1799
02:01:04,507 --> 02:01:07,806
Show it to me! Show me that telegram!

1800
02:01:12,815 --> 02:01:13,804
I ate it.

1801
02:01:15,151 --> 02:01:17,312
What did you just say to me?

1802
02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:20,982
I ate it.

1803
02:01:24,327 --> 02:01:25,658
Good for you, Martha.

1804
02:01:26,329 --> 02:01:29,264
You make a joke at a time like this?

1805
02:01:29,465 --> 02:01:30,796
Did I not eat the telegram?

1806
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,833
You ate it. I watched you
and you ate it all down.

1807
02:01:34,170 --> 02:01:35,159
Like a good boy.

1808
02:01:36,772 --> 02:01:38,603
You won't get away with this.

1809
02:01:40,843 --> 02:01:43,175
You know the rules, for God's sake!

1810
02:01:44,513 --> 02:01:46,003
What are you talking about?

1811
02:01:46,349 --> 02:01:47,680
I can kill him if I want to.

1812
02:01:48,017 --> 02:01:49,075
He is our child.

1813
02:01:49,285 --> 02:01:52,584
- You bore him. A good delivery.
- He is our child.

1814
02:01:52,788 --> 02:01:54,016
And I've killed him.

1815
02:01:56,392 --> 02:01:58,917
Oh my God, I think I understand this.

1816
02:01:59,362 --> 02:02:00,294
Do you?

1817
02:02:01,063 --> 02:02:04,362
- Oh my God, I think I understand this.
- Good for you.

1818
02:02:09,138 --> 02:02:12,335
You've no right.
You've no right at all.

1819
02:02:12,541 --> 02:02:17,001
I have the right, we never spoke of it.
I could kill him any time I wanted.

1820
02:02:17,246 --> 02:02:18,907
Why?

1821
02:02:19,215 --> 02:02:20,443
You broke our rule, Martha.

1822
02:02:20,683 --> 02:02:24,244
You mentioned him to somebody else.

1823
02:02:24,553 --> 02:02:26,384
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

1824
02:02:29,925 --> 02:02:31,893
To me, you mentioned him to me.

1825
02:02:35,064 --> 02:02:36,224
I forget.

1826
02:02:37,566 --> 02:02:41,525
Sometimes when it's late night
and everybody's talking...

1827
02:02:41,904 --> 02:02:43,895
...I forget and I want to mention him.

1828
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:46,902
But I hold on. I hold on.

1829
02:02:48,277 --> 02:02:50,905
I've wanted to so often.

1830
02:02:51,914 --> 02:02:53,905
But, George, you've pushed it.

1831
02:02:54,250 --> 02:02:57,413
There was no need,
there was no need for this!

1832
02:02:59,088 --> 02:03:00,919
I mentioned him, all right?

1833
02:03:02,258 --> 02:03:04,749
But you didn't have
to push it over the edge.

1834
02:03:05,594 --> 02:03:07,585
You didn't have to kill him.

1835
02:03:15,604 --> 02:03:19,096
You didn't have to have him die.

1836
02:03:24,814 --> 02:03:27,442
That wasn't needed.

1837
02:03:57,146 --> 02:03:58,670
It's dawn.

1838
02:04:00,249 --> 02:04:02,080
I think the party's over.

1839
02:04:07,990 --> 02:04:09,651
You couldn't have any?

1840
02:04:12,361 --> 02:04:13,589
We couldn't.

1841
02:04:18,501 --> 02:04:21,299
Home to bed, children.
It's way past your bedtime.

1842
02:04:32,281 --> 02:04:33,748
You two go now.

1843
02:04:48,030 --> 02:04:49,861
- I'd like to...
- Goodnight.

1844
02:05:17,026 --> 02:05:18,391
You want anything?

1845
02:05:19,728 --> 02:05:21,218
No. Nothing.

1846
02:05:27,036 --> 02:05:28,367
Time for bed.

1847
02:05:35,077 --> 02:05:36,135
Tired?

1848
02:05:36,512 --> 02:05:37,536
Yes.

1849
02:05:38,847 --> 02:05:39,836
I am.

1850
02:05:49,225 --> 02:05:50,749
Sunday tomorrow.

1851
02:05:53,195 --> 02:05:54,389
All day.

1852
02:06:32,034 --> 02:06:34,059
Did you have to?

1853
02:06:36,105 --> 02:06:37,129
Yes.

1854
02:06:41,977 --> 02:06:43,342
You had to?

1855
02:06:49,985 --> 02:06:51,077
I don't know.

1856
02:06:54,657 --> 02:06:56,852
- It was time.
- Was it?

1857
02:07:08,170 --> 02:07:09,603
I'm cold.

1858
02:07:12,174 --> 02:07:13,232
It's late.

1859
02:07:25,788 --> 02:07:27,255
It will be better.

1860
02:07:30,626 --> 02:07:32,059
I don't know.

1861
02:07:33,195 --> 02:07:34,924
It will be. Maybe.

1862
02:07:37,366 --> 02:07:39,197
I'm not sure.

1863
02:07:48,043 --> 02:07:49,237
Just us?

1864
02:07:53,716 --> 02:07:55,411
- You don't suppose maybe...
- No.

1865
02:08:09,465 --> 02:08:11,126
- You all right?
- Yes.

1866
02:08:16,972 --> 02:08:17,939
No.

1867
02:08:23,078 --> 02:08:26,536
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?

1868
02:08:28,884 --> 02:08:30,215
I am, George.

1869
02:08:33,922 --> 02:08:35,219
I am, George.

1870
02:08:37,226 --> 02:08:38,318
I am.
