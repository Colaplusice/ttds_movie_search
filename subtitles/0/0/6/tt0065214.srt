2
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,880
Turn him over.

3
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,600
Oh, no!

4
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,080
"Do not drink wine nor strong drink...

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,400
"...thou, nor thy sons with thee...

6
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,200
"...lest ye shall die.

7
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,200
"Look not thou upon the wine
when it is red...

8
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,000
"...and when it bringeth his color
in the cup, when it moveth itseIf aright.

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,720
"At the last it biteth like a serpent...

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,800
"...and stingeth like an adder."

11
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,400
Now, folks...

12
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,600
...that's from the Good Book...

13
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,400
...but in this town...

14
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
...it's five cents a glass.

15
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,240
Five cents a glass.

16
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,080
Does anyone really think
that is the price of a drink?

17
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,240
The price of a drink? Let him decide...

18
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,000
...who has lost his courage and pride...

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,360
...who lies a groveling
heap of clay not far removed....

20
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,560
All's quiet, sir.

21
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,840
Let's fall in.

22
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,880
Follow me.

23
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,600
I beg your pardon.

24
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,600
-I'm so sorry.
-Allow me, ma'am.

25
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,800
Thank you.

26
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,120
May I?

27
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,080
Thank you.

28
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,400
Thornton, wake up! Soldiers!

29
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,880
Look.

30
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,200
I don't care what you meant to do...

31
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,640
...it's what you did I don't like.

32
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
You inconvenienced this lady,
and made a fool of yourself...

33
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,320
...and this railroad.

34
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,480
Now, I want you to apologize to this....

35
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,640
Yes, can I help you?

36
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,000
If they move, kill them.

37
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,280
ls he with them?

38
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,480
He's there.

39
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,560
Hold your fire! Get down!

40
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,600
Wait till they come out.

41
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,240
I can nail him.

42
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,960
I said, wait!

43
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,560
What if they go out the back?

44
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,480
It's covered.
You two-bit redneck peckerwood.

45
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,400
Abe?

46
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,920
I solemnly promise...

47
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,800
...God helping me....

48
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,520
"I solemnly promise, God helping me..."

49
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,880
...to abstain from all distilled,
fermented malt liquors...

50
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,400
...including wine, beer and cider...

51
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,600
"...to abstain from liquor,
wine, cider and beer."

52
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,520
People marching down the street.
They'll pass by the horses.

53
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,400
We'll join them.

54
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,320
The Temperance Union?

55
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,400
They should have been told.

56
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,600
Told what?

57
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,160
How long can anybody in this manure pile
keep his mouth shut?

58
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,960
"Yes, we'll gather at the river

59
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,160
"The beautiful, beautiful river

60
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,640
"Gather with the saints at the river"

61
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,960
Rifles.

62
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,040
One?

63
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,080
No, three!

64
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,120
Maybe more, there, on the roof.

65
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,200
Get down.

66
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,880
Son of a bitch!

67
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,000
Bounty hunters?

68
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Hell, I wouldn't know.

69
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,480
Buck, with Abe.

70
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,920
I kill them now?

71
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,440
Hold them here as long as you can.

72
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,480
I'll hold them till hell freezes over
or you say different.

73
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,280
When I kick him out, blast him.

74
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,560
We'll run for it.

75
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,480
Give me that shotgun.

76
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,120
"The beautiful, beautiful river

77
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,320
"Gather with the saints at the river

78
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,840
"That flows by the throne of God"

79
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,160
Set?

80
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,160
Let's go!

81
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,640
Good luck, boys!

82
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,360
They're blowing this town to hell!

83
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,520
You're trash!

84
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Now, you just hush now.

85
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,640
They was playing Gather at the River.

86
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,480
You know that one?

87
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,480
Sing it!

88
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,160
"Shall we gather at the river

89
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,040
"Where bright angel feet have trod"

90
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,080
Hurry!

91
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,800
"River that flows by the throne of God"

92
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,280
Come on, you lazy bastard!

93
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,800
I'm coming!

94
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,920
They've cleared out, for Christ's sake!

95
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,000
Let's go, T.C. !

96
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,960
Put some more on!

97
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,640
Let's go!

98
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,120
Take him !

99
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,520
He's mine!

100
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,240
He's mine!

101
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,720
He's mine!

102
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,640
I shot this one!
Look at the size of that hole!

103
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,640
You just dig out that bullet
and see if it ain't my .06!

104
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,840
You know I shot him.

105
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,600
You'd claim the whole thing, wouldn't you?

106
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,680
-Daddy! Daddy!
-Did he have any money?

107
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,160
Damn, I can't get his belt off!

108
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
You stupid, damn fools!

109
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,040
Why did you shoot this employee
and let the others get away?

110
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,040
I didn't! My first shot
killed this man right here!

111
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,320
Liar!

112
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,760
He shot that employee while I dropped
this bandit and them others too.

113
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,440
I must've killed all three of them.

114
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,920
What were we doing up on that roof?

115
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,240
Liar!

116
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,440
Black liar!

117
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,600
Don't talk like that to me.

118
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,120
I'm sorry.

119
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,600
Come on, T.C., help me get his boots.

120
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,040
I think this will do pretty good.

121
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,880
Next time, plan the massacre carefully,
or I'll start with you.

122
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,520
Why didn't you kill Pike
when you had the chance?

123
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,320
Stop!

124
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,040
Feathers flew like a turkey!

125
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,880
They shouldn't have run.

126
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,680
Say!

127
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,200
How'd you like to kiss
my sister's black cat's ass?

128
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,880
This is better than a hog-killing!

129
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,960
Get them out of here!

130
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,760
We're holding you and your railroad
responsible for this carnage!

131
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,040
lnnocent people are dead!

132
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,840
Women dying and mangled because
you used our town as a battlefield!

133
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,240
The railroad is going to pay
for our loss of blood!

134
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,600
We were trying to catch outlaws!

135
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,440
You lured them in here!

136
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,000
The railroad has been blabbing
about a big payload for weeks!

137
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,560
We represent the law!

138
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,760
Pike, is that you?

139
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,960
I can ride.

140
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,480
I can ride.

141
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,560
I can't see, but I can ride.

142
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,360
No!

143
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,160
I can't ride.

144
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,840
Finish it.

145
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,040
You boys want to move on,
or stay and give him...

146
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,360
...a decent burial?

147
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,560
He was a good man.

148
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,360
We should bury him.

149
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,560
He's dead!

150
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,960
He's got a lot of good men
to keep him company!

151
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,600
Too damn many!

152
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,720
I think the boys are right.

153
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,320
I'd like to say a few words for the dear,
dead departed.

154
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,120
Maybe a few hymns'd be in order!

155
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,560
Followed by a church supper...

156
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,280
...with a choir!

157
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,720
You crazy bastards, both of you!

158
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,560
Bishop, Engstrom...

159
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,360
...the Gorch brothers!

160
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,960
Amounts to a total of $4,500
and you let them ride out on you!

161
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,160
When the hard-money value
of these men you killed...

162
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,800
...less my commission, adds up to $500!

163
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,960
Any one of those pelts would've
not only cleared you with the company...

164
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,360
...but given you money to raise hell with!

165
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,480
We'll do better next time!

166
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,960
We'll do anything you say,
but we'd appreciate liquor money tonight.

167
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,520
There won't be any tonight!
You go after them in ten minutes!

168
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,800
Get them ! Get Pike and you'll be rich!

169
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,960
If one of you tries to quit on me...

170
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,360
...I'll pay a bonus of $1 ,000...

171
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,240
...to the man that kills him !

172
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,520
Let's pack it up then!

173
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,760
-Why should I let you go with them?
-We've been over that.

174
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,760
You might join them again.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

175
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,320
What I like and what I need
are two different things. Listen.

176
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,560
I don't want to go back to prison,
never again.

177
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,960
It's got to be my way!
I need some good men!

178
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,760
You saw what happened out there!

179
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,760
Use what you have and see
that it doesn't happen again...

180
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,160
...or I'lI see you spend the rest of your life
behind bars.

181
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,960
Try to run, I'll be after you and so will they.

182
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,160
I gave you my word.

183
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,280
We'lI see what it's worth!

184
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,120
Six minutes.

185
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,120
Tell me...

186
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,920
...how does it feel...

187
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
...getting paid for it?

188
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,600
Getting paid to sit back and hire your
killings with the law's arms around you?

189
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,680
How's it feel to be so goddamn right?

190
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,320
Good.

191
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,400
You dirty son of a bitch!

192
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,040
You've got 30 days to get Pike
or 30 days back to Yuma.

193
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,800
You're my Judas goat, Mr. Thornton.

194
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,520
I want all of them back here,
head down over a saddle.

195
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,560
Thirty days to get Pike
or 30 days back to Yuma.

196
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,520
I don't see nothing so lindo about it.

197
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,040
Just looks like more of Texas to me.

198
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,280
You have no eyes.

199
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,200
Got a haIf hour of light. Let's go.

200
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,040
Hello, little fella.

201
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,760
-Them other fellas--
-They're not coming!

202
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,960
-None of them?
-No.

203
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,840
-But I got horses and saddles for them.
-We'lI need them, they won't.

204
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,840
Now, about the sharing up.

205
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,400
lt will be the same as always.

206
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,760
Me and Tector don't think that
he ought to get the same amount.

207
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,920
He's just starting out,
and this is our opening for a new territory.

208
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,120
That's right.

209
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,360
I figure a share to that old goat for
watching the horses is a share too much.

210
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,880
So, we decided...

211
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,280
...it ain't fair.

212
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,200
If you two don't like equal shares,
why the hell don't you just take all of it?

213
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,320
Why don't you answer me,
you damned, yellow-livered trash?

214
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,120
Now, Pike, you know--

215
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,200
I don't know a damned thing except
I either lead this bunch or end it now.

216
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,760
We divide it up just like you say.

217
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,080
Chick, chick, chick, chick.

218
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,520
Silver rings.

219
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,480
Silver rings, your butt!
Them's washers! Damn!

220
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,760
Bastards!

221
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,120
Washers!

222
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,400
We shot our way out of that town
for a dollar's worth of steel holes!

223
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,120
They set it up!

224
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,560
They? Who in the hell is "they"?

225
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,960
"They?"

226
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,520
"They" is just plain and fancy "they."

227
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
That's who "they" is.

228
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,160
Caught you, didn't they?
Tied a tin can to your tail!

229
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,080
Led you in and waltzed you out again!

230
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,640
Oh, my, what a bunch!

231
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,800
Big tough ones!

232
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,240
Here you are with a handful of holes,
a thumb up your ass...

233
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,320
...and a big grin to pass
the time of day with.

234
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,720
"They! "

235
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,800
Who the hell is "they"?

236
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,520
Railroad men.

237
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,000
Bounty hunters.

238
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,960
Deke Thornton.

239
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,760
Deke Thornton?

240
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,360
He was one of them?

241
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,000
How come you didn't know that?

242
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,680
Hey, gringo.

243
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,520
You can have my silver.

244
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,520
Come on, don't kill me.

245
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,760
You can have the silver.

246
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,120
But don't kill me.

247
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,440
Please?

248
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,480
Go on...

249
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,080
...go for it.

250
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,800
Fall apart.

251
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,280
Walk softly, boys.

252
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,280
What's our next move?

253
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,760
I figure Agua Verde is the closest.

254
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,680
Three days, maybe.

255
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,360
We'll get the news and go to the border.

256
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,080
Maybe a payroll or a bank.

257
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,880
Maybe that damn railroad!

258
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,760
That damn railroad you're talking
about sure isn't getting no easier.

259
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,720
And you boys ain't getting any younger.

260
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,720
We must start thinking beyond our guns.

261
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,880
Those days are closing fast.

262
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,880
All your planning and talking
damn near got us shot...

263
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,400
...over a few lousy bags of washers.

264
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,840
This was going to be
me and Tector's last job!

265
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,480
We spent all our time and money
getting ready for this!

266
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,680
You spent time and money running whores
while I spent my stake setting it up!

267
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,040
I should have been running whores
instead of stealing army horses!

268
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,880
While you did the planning...

269
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,360
...me and Tector was getting
our bell rope pulled by two...

270
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,800
...two, mind you, Hondo whores!

271
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,480
And Pike was dreaming of washers!

272
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,840
He was.

273
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,240
You were matching whores...

274
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,720
...in tandem !

275
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,640
What's that?

276
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,800
One behind the other.

277
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,920
That's right! That's what we was doing!

278
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,320
Mr. Thornton?

279
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,960
You rode with Pike.

280
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,120
What kind of man are we up against?

281
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,560
The best.

282
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,200
He never got caught.

283
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,520
This was going to be my last.

284
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,640
Ain't getting around any better.

285
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,600
I'd like to make one good score
and back off.

286
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,640
Back off to what?

287
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,200
Have you got anything lined up?

288
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,560
Pershing's got troops spread out
all along the border.

289
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,520
Every one of those garrisons
will get a payroll.

290
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,480
That kind of information is kind of hard
to come by.

291
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,200
I didn't say it's going to be easy,
but it can be done.

292
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,320
He'll be waiting for us.

293
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,880
I wouldn't have it any other way.

294
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,880
Come on Pike, let's go.

295
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,280
You sound like you're all caught up.

296
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,680
Enough to know we've overstayed
our welcome.

297
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,480
What's wrong with you?

298
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,640
We've got plenty of money to spend,
and no worries.

299
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,080
They're not going to look for us
in their own backyard.

300
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,280
How can you be so damn sure?

301
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,600
Being sure is my business.

302
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,000
Being sure is my business.

303
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,480
Hold it!

304
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,680
Relax.

305
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,200
It's just some champagne we ordered.

306
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,080
Relax. It'sjust some champagne
we ordered.

307
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,000
Being sure is my business.

308
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,680
Did you get him?

309
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,400
No, he got away.

310
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,600
You sure must have hurt that railroad.

311
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,000
They spent a lot of money
setting up that ambush.

312
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,960
I caught up with them.

313
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,200
Two or three times.

314
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,000
There was a man named Harrigan.

315
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,600
He used to have a way of doing things.

316
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,760
I made him change his ways.

317
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,800
And a hell of a lot of people...

318
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,160
...just can't stand to be wrong.

319
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,720
Pride.

320
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,000
And they can't forget it.

321
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,680
That pride, being wrong, or learn by it.

322
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,360
How about us?

323
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,960
You reckon we learned...

324
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,880
...being wrong today?

325
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,680
I sure hope to God we did.

326
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,480
Them's hot.

327
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,040
Damn!

328
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,080
Where in helI did you find him?

329
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,360
He ran with Thornton and me.

330
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,960
Did his share of killing, and more.

331
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,640
Around Langtry.

332
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Only now he does his killing
with a coffee cup.

333
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,440
I wouldn't have it any other way either.

334
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,640
Watch out, boys!

335
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,320
Take it easy!

336
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,120
Watch him, Tector!

337
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,800
That goddamned son of a bitch!

338
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,120
Get the horses up!

339
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,160
What the hell is going--

340
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,200
Damned old punk! Bastard!

341
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,680
Get up now! Get up there, goddamn it!

342
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,520
Help!

343
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,400
Get over here! Help!

344
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,640
What's the matter with you, old man?

345
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,840
Leave him alone!

346
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,360
He'll get us all killed!
I'm going to get rid of him.

347
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,200
No you're not! We're sticking together,
like it used to be.

348
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,480
When you side with a man, you stay with
him. If you can't, you're an animal!

349
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,240
You're finished!

350
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,440
We're finished! All of us!

351
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,720
Mount up.

352
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,040
Appears Brother Pike needs help.

353
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,480
That Brother Pike and the old man Sykes...

354
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,280
...makes a man wonder if it ain't time...

355
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,240
...to pick up his chips
and find another game.

356
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,720
How can you side anybody
when you can't get on your horse?

357
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,720
That was a fine talk you gave the boys
about sticking together.

358
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,040
That Gorch came near killing me.

359
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,560
Or me him.

360
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,480
Damned old fool like me's
not worth taking along!

361
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,080
-We started together, we'll end together.
-That's how I see it.

362
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,760
That's the way it's always been with me.

363
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,040
Sorry about Deke.

364
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,320
I never figured him that way.

365
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,080
Back there in Starbuck...

366
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,000
...how did my boy do?

367
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,520
Your boy?

368
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,080
Crazy Lee?

369
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,120
Yes, C.L., Clarence Lee.

370
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,480
My daughter's boy.
Not too bright, but a good boy.

371
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,800
I kill 'em now? I kill 'em now?

372
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,680
No, you just hold them here.

373
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,360
Why didn't you say he was your grandson?

374
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,760
You had enough things on your mind.

375
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,320
Besides, he had to pull his own weight
like the rest of us.

376
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,600
I just wanted to make sure he didn't
let you down, run, when things got hot.

377
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,200
He did fine.

378
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,520
Just fine.

379
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,760
All clear!

380
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,720
From here on it's Mexico, Mr. Thornton.

381
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,200
What's the closest town of any size?

382
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,400
Agua Verde.

383
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,080
What's in Agua Verde?

384
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,960
Mexicans, what else?

385
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,480
A headquarters for regulars
fighting against Villa.

386
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,280
Mapache territory.

387
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,000
Don't we follow?

388
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,720
No, we go back and wait.

389
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,160
We're supposed--

390
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,560
Shut up!

391
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,600
Why won't you tell your folks
to feed them dogs?

392
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,760
Won't find very much around here.
That damn Huerta's scraped it clean.

393
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,160
I have invited you to my village.

394
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,120
Any disrespect to my family
or to my people...

395
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,560
...I will kill you.

396
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,160
Ashamed of having us meet your people?

397
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,560
Yes. They don't know about
my life when I leave the village.

398
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,320
You got a sister?

399
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,760
I'd be proud to make her acquaintance...

400
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,000
...and that of your mama too.

401
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,760
That goes for your grandma too, sonny.

402
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,160
How bad was it?

403
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,400
Seven of the villagers were killed.
Two of them hung.

404
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,280
Our horses, cattle and corn, stolen.

405
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,760
What about the federal troops?
Didn't they protect you?

406
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,920
They were federal troops...

407
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,560
...commissioned by the traitor, Huerta.

408
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,960
And the soldier who shot my father?

409
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,760
What was his name?

410
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,920
-What does it matter?
-Your father died like a man.

411
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,560
The names are not important.

412
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,160
How was he called?

413
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,160
Mapache.

414
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,440
That is name enough.

415
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,720
In Mexico...

416
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,960
...these are the years of sadness.

417
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,680
But if we had...

418
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,560
...rifles like these....

419
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,920
And Teresa? Did they molest her?

420
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,880
She went with them
because she wished to.

421
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,520
She became the woman of Mapache...

422
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,560
...and the others.
She went with them, laughing.

423
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,200
Drunk with wine and love.

424
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,120
To him, Teresa was a goddess,
to be worshipped from afar.

425
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,400
I tell you, she was a mango...

426
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,720
...ripe and waiting.

427
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,760
Angel dreams of love
and Mapache eats the mango.

428
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,600
That's a good trick.

429
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,480
Now that I find hard to believe.

430
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,880
Not so hard.

431
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,240
We all dream of being a child again.

432
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,640
Even the worst of us.

433
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,400
Perhaps the worst most of all.

434
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,120
You know what we are, then?

435
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,400
Yes, just so, the both of you!

436
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,120
And you!

437
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,680
Where is Mapache?

438
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,280
All right, Pike? All right?

439
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,360
Tector, let's swap!

440
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,800
Come on, let's swap!

441
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,800
You must tell me. Where is Mapache?

442
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,960
Why do you wish to know?

443
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,040
For your father?

444
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,720
Or the whore?

445
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,000
Either you learn to live with it...

446
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,680
...or we'll leave you here.

447
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,960
I go with you.

448
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,880
You know what I'm going to do?
Steal his girl.

449
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,920
You are?

450
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,800
Here I go.

451
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,320
Dutch, I'm cutting in.

452
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,960
Come on, lady!

453
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,720
No gringos?

454
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,280
Only federales.

455
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,200
All soldiers...

456
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,560
...not a bounty hunter in sight.

457
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,360
Now, what the hell is that?

458
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,440
Atencin!

459
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,720
I saw one just like it in Waco.

460
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,200
Run on steam?

461
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,000
No, on alcohol or gasoline.

462
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,800
You know what I heard?

463
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,280
I heard they got one of those things
up north that can fly.

464
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,800
That was a balloon, you damned old fool.

465
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,600
No, the old man's right.

466
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,200
They've got motors and wings
and go 60 miles in less than an hour.

467
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,440
Going to use them in the war.

468
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,000
Let's talk to the General...

469
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,920
...about his automobile
and our extra horses.

470
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,240
Nice and easy.

471
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,560
Do you know these Americans, General?

472
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,160
No, I don't know any Americans,
and these men even less.

473
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,200
Six beers, please.

474
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,040
Probably talking about us
behind our backs.

475
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,000
I'm down to about twenty in silver.

476
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,200
Since the Generalsimo cleaned out
this area, he ought to have a lot to spare.

477
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,040
Generalsimo, hell.

478
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,600
He's just another bandit
grabbing all he can for himself.

479
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,000
Like some others I could mention.

480
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,200
Not so as you'd know it.

481
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,240
We ain't nothing like him.
We don't hang nobody.

482
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,640
I hope someday these people kick
the scum like him into their graves.

483
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,560
We will.

484
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,040
If it takes forever!

485
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,360
General!

486
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,000
Look what I brought you.

487
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,560
-What a beautiful horse!
-It's for you.

488
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,760
For me?

489
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,360
It's my gift to you.

490
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,040
A thoroughbred.

491
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,800
Send him off to mate with my mare.

492
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,120
Then he'll be in shape to mate
with all the other mares.

493
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,600
And you, pretty brunette, come with me.

494
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,240
Look here.

495
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,920
Good looking old pony, ain't he?

496
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,520
Boy, do you know those beauties?

497
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,480
You left the village.

498
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,760
So what?

499
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,480
I left your stinking village...

500
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,840
...so I would not starve.

501
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,880
Look at me now, I'm happy.

502
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,880
Very happy.

503
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,680
I'm living with the big boss
of this place...

504
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,400
...General Mapache.

505
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,360
Come on.

506
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,120
She was my woman.

507
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,520
I know.

508
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,440
Sure ain't your woman no more.

509
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,320
Just look at her licking
inside that general's ear.

510
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,280
Bitch!

511
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,280
What's going on here?

512
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,960
Why did he try to kill His Excellency?

513
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:53,880
He didn't try to kill His Excellency.
He was after the girl.

514
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,840
She was his fiance.

515
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,760
He went a little crazy
when he saw her with you.

516
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,720
Are you associated
with the American Army?

517
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,120
No, we're not associated with anybody.

518
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,520
I see.

519
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,520
I was curious about the equipment
which you are carrying. That pistol...

520
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,720
...is restricted for the use
of army personnel.

521
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,920
lt can't be purchased or even owned...

522
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,520
...legally.

523
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,720
ls that so?

524
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,800
Weapons are my specialty.

525
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,560
I am Commander Frederick Mohr
of the lmperial German Army.

526
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,920
lt would be very useful for us
if we knew of some Americans...

527
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,520
...who did not share their
government's naive sentiments.

528
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,320
We share very few sentiments
with our government.

529
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:03,040
Perhaps we should invite these gentlemen
to have a drink with us.

530
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,960
He's inviting us for a drink.

531
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,520
Why not? Let's have a drink.

532
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,600
Good.

533
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,200
Shoot him.

534
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,280
I gave it to him, T.C.

535
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,400
Out! Stop praying!

536
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,320
Enough! You old hags!

537
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,240
Out!

538
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,400
Here?

539
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,200
No, no, not there!

540
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,320
Wait, what are you going to do?

541
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,080
We got to show a little class here.

542
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,920
Right here!

543
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,600
lt must be that garrison rail spur.

544
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,520
It's the easiest to hit, but I must find a way
to get it out of there.

545
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,760
What do you think?

546
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,160
Getting close to home.

547
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,800
Look at them gathered around the table.

548
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,840
Here we sit like kitchen help.

549
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,360
Why do you want us to hit that train
at the border?

550
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,240
Can't the General take over
the whole thing?

551
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,880
General Huerta is anxious
to better relations with the US...

552
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,440
...not to cross the border
and destroy them.

553
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,360
Usually these arms shipments
are kept pretty secret.

554
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,960
How'd you find out about this?

555
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,080
Mapache has a superb intelligence force
organized by my commanding officer.

556
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,560
Now, gentlemen...

557
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,720
...we are well organized...

558
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,240
...and able to pay $1 0,000...

559
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,480
...in gold.

560
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,840
If you're not able to do the work,
we'll find someone else.

561
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,960
We can do it. But we're
going to need equipment.

562
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,560
Do not worry.

563
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,880
Our accountant will take care of it.

564
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,240
General...

565
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,920
...soon you will be the best
equipped general in Mexico.

566
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,920
Look here...

567
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,240
...ain't he the one.

568
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,520
To the host!

569
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,160
With your permission...

570
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,360
...I need a bath.

571
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,400
With my permission,
I think you alI need a bath.

572
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,760
I don't!

573
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,400
What me and Tector need
is them women you're hogging.

574
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,920
Can you fix that up for us?

575
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,560
Gentlemen...

576
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,360
...you will excuse me.

577
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,800
I'm sure.

578
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,160
Herrera.

579
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,880
Let's get Angel.

580
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,080
I need him.

581
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,760
I'll give you someone
much better than that.

582
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,560
If you don't mind, I'll make my own choice.

583
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,320
Let them take him away, General.

584
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,560
All right.

585
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,680
He is not important to me.

586
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,400
Take him.

587
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,040
I think we're gonna get on the wagon now.

588
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,920
Hey, here come our sweeties.

589
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,520
Ain't them pretty?

590
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,480
I don't know about yours, Lyle,
but I think...

591
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,440
...I got more than I can handle.

592
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,520
Hey, get out of them....

593
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,040
You know what they told me?

594
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,920
The dons of Spain built this
over 300 years ago.

595
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,280
ls that right?

596
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,880
That's right.

597
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,760
I tell you, Lyle, I'm all for them dons.

598
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,640
Let's have a little target.

599
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,360
She won't get away. Turn her loose.

600
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,680
Why not!

601
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,360
Tector, look at them beauties!

602
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,240
How in the helI can you stand it that hot?

603
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,960
I'm going to build me one of these
some day and live in it.

604
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,840
Hell, Lyle, look here.

605
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,040
Come on, sweetheart,
let me see your teatsies.

606
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,680
I don't know why the hell
I didn't let them kill you.

607
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,800
I'm not going to steal guns for that devil
to rob and kill my people again.

608
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,560
Noble, noble. Very noble.

609
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,720
I didn't see no tears on your cheeks
when you rode in from Starbuck.

610
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,120
They were not my people.

611
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,560
I care about my people, my village.

612
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,040
Listen, boy, you ride with us,
your village don't count.

613
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,600
If it does, you don't go along.

614
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,640
Then I don't go along.

615
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,840
Angel, one load of guns ain't going
to stop them raiding villages.

616
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,880
Think about all the money you'lI have.

617
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,280
Buy them a ranch. Move them 1 ,000 miles.

618
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,880
-Buy them two or three ranches.
-One.

619
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,640
A very small one.

620
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,120
Don't you see? This is their land.

621
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,880
No one will drive them away.

622
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,320
I'll drink to that sentiment.

623
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,040
And to love.

624
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,800
But most of all, I'll drink to gold!

625
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,720
You're a pain in the ass.

626
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:35,280
Would you give guns to someone
to kill your father...

627
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,440
...or your mother, or your brother?

628
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,400
Ten thousand cuts an awful lot
of family ties.

629
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,640
My people have no guns.

630
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,960
But with guns...

631
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,720
...my people could fight.

632
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,240
If I could take guns...

633
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,440
...I would come with you.

634
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,040
How many cases of rifles
did Zamorra say was in that shipment?

635
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,640
Sixteen.

636
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,040
Give him one.

637
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,520
All right.

638
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:22,760
One case and one case of ammo.
But you give up your share of the gold.

639
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,600
I will.

640
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,800
We know you will.

641
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,640
Sure glad we got that settled.

642
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,480
Why, you reprobate!

643
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,600
Boys...

644
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:54,240
...I want you to meet my fiance.

645
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,600
They just got engaged.

646
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,840
I'm a son of a bitch!

647
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,880
Trot them on in, fellas.

648
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:07,520
I'm hell on packing mules,
but I'm a delight with a pretty girl.

649
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:16,920
You want to gamble everything
that this one shipment will be attacked?

650
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,800
If they're in Agua Verde, they'll try for it.

651
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,920
-lf? What about Juarez?
-If he was, we would've heard about it.

652
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,920
If they are in Agua Verde,
they wilI have seen Mapache.

653
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,720
And who in hell is Mapache?

654
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:30,720
A killer for Huerta who
calls himseIf a general.

655
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,520
He's been fighting Villa and losing.

656
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:36,120
But with enough guns, he could become
a power in northern Mexico.

657
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,920
Pike will try to get them for him.

658
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,320
How? The train will be guarded
by regular troops.

659
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:43,520
Not regular troops,
green recruits not worth a damn.

660
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,440
I need 20 trained men, not recruits.

661
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,120
And not this...

662
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,480
...gutter trash you've given me.

663
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:54,080
What you've got is 24 more days.

664
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:10,320
Never told me how you got
all torn up like that.

665
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,680
I met a woman I wanted to marry.

666
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,680
ls your husband coming back?

667
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,880
No.

668
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,480
He's never coming back.

669
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,240
But you are late.

670
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,080
Two days late.

671
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,880
She had a husband.

672
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,560
If I had any sense, I'd have killed him.

673
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,440
He wasn't around.

674
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,160
I got careless.

675
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,680
One night, he walked in on us.

676
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:58,360
Caught her with the first shot,
and got me here with the second.

677
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,200
Then the coward turned and ran.

678
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,480
Ever catch up with him?

679
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:27,320
No, but there isn't an hour that
passes that I don't think about it.

680
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,160
Come on! We've got a long way!

681
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,320
This is our last go around, Dutch.

682
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,000
This time, we do it right.

683
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,840
Just do your work.

684
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,360
Let's go!

685
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,800
They're coming!

686
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,800
They're coming!

687
01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,880
Faster!

688
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,760
Get over!

689
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,280
Get that ramp up!

690
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,480
Get that horse out of here!

691
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,120
Bring them all out! Get them out!

692
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,720
Get over here!

693
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:48,440
Get them over here! Get those horses!

694
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,280
Hurry!

695
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,080
Your horse kicked me.

696
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,880
Run them up along here!

697
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,040
Where the hell is my horse?

698
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,080
Hey, we got grenades!

699
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:41,040
-Hurry! We gotta get out of here!
-Be careful!

700
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,840
Let's go on this.

701
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,800
Here we go.

702
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,880
Line up in two columns!

703
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,760
Corporal, give us a hand here!

704
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,000
We're all ready!

705
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:49,920
Let's go!

706
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:54,080
Come on!

707
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,440
Get after that horse!

708
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,240
That was my horse!

709
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,520
Get after him !

710
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,640
Get out!

711
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,600
Get that damn horse off my butt!

712
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,640
Get the horse out! The train's coming!

713
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,840
Train?

714
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,440
Where?

715
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,640
What train?

716
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,400
I don't see any--

717
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,680
Get the goddamn horse off my foot!

718
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:53,440
Corporal, ride back to the telegraph
at Todos Malos...

719
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,440
...and tell them the railroad deputies
robbed the train...

720
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,240
...and we're in pursuit!

721
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,680
Yes, sir!

722
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,640
Come on!

723
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,040
Damn son of a... !

724
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,040
Come on! It's lit!

725
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,200
Get them horses going!

726
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,760
Don't shoot! It's the army!

727
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,400
Come on!

728
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,320
Let's go!

729
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,680
Come on, you lazy bastard!

730
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,560
I'm coming, damn it!

731
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,440
ls it all right?

732
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,720
Yes.

733
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,120
Where are they supposed to meet us?

734
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,920
Agua Verde or before.

735
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:47,160
But when we do meet them,
don't expect any open arms.

736
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,200
Least we won't have to worry about Deke.

737
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,560
Not after riding a haIf a case of dynamite
into the river.

738
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:58,360
Don't expect him to stay there.
He'll be along and you know it.

739
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:12,880
I would like to get hold
of that fool horse of mine.

740
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:16,280
Some Mex kid's probably riding him home
right now.

741
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:19,240
I don't see how I could've lost
both my boots.

742
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,640
They always were hard to get on.

743
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:22,880
The river sucked them off.

744
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,000
That dynamite helped some.

745
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:29,120
Maybe the same kid that's riding
T.C.'s horse is wearing your boots.

746
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:31,960
You stupid bastards!

747
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,880
Why did you fire at those soldiers?

748
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,680
Huey started firing at them.

749
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,480
I tried to stop him.

750
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:39,680
One of the bandits--

751
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:40,880
Don't blame me!

752
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,080
Liar!

753
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,840
Shut your mouths!

754
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,680
Are we going after them?

755
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:48,520
Yes, unless you want to face a firing squad.

756
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,760
Come on, T.C. !

757
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,920
Why the hell do we have to leave now?

758
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,920
Besides, my hair's wet!

759
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,840
Pancho Villa is attacking!

760
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,320
lmpossible! We have no arms
or ammunition.

761
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:26,240
A telegram from San Antonio, General.

762
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:39,280
The gringos assaulted the train!

763
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,080
They got the guns.

764
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,600
We must go!

765
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:50,080
Take the necessary people
and take the road to Agua Verde.

766
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,680
Convince the gringos to give you the guns.
I'll wait in the village.

767
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:56,120
-If the gringos refuse?
-Matalos!

768
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,760
The next time we meet, I'll destroy you.

769
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,400
Let's leave, General.

770
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:18,160
He's still heading east.

771
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:23,840
Are they bluffing, or did they really miss it?

772
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:29,920
I'd say they missed it.

773
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,480
Take a look.

774
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:36,120
There's only five left.

775
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:44,920
Hell, we lost them.

776
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,640
I don't see how.

777
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:49,720
Unless it was in the big valley
where the ground was hard.

778
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:53,840
There was but one way they could take
a wagon out of there, and this is it.

779
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,960
They didn't take it out.

780
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:59,320
We haven't lost them.
I could point to them right now.

781
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,120
Sit still, damn it!

782
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:04,120
You think Pike and Sykes
haven't been watching us?

783
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,520
They know what this is about.
What do I have?

784
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,520
Nothing but you chicken-stealing
gutter trash...

785
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,920
...with not even 60 rounds between you.

786
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,640
We're after men.

787
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,720
And I wish to God I was with them.

788
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:20,400
The next time you make a mistake,
I'll ride off and let you die.

789
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:24,080
Come on.

790
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,520
I never figured they'd come down here
after us.

791
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,920
How much you reckon we could be worth?

792
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:39,240
Depends on how hungry they are.

793
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:45,920
You better stay here
and look out for big hats.

794
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,320
I'll go and start rigging the fireworks.

795
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,800
All right.

796
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,320
Get that case of explosives
off the back there!

797
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,520
Hand me down those blasting caps.

798
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,360
What're you gonna do with the dynamite?

799
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,920
I figure that general will try to take
this load without paying for it...

800
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,240
...and shoot us in the bargain.

801
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:22,520
The only thing to change his mind
is if something happened to these guns.

802
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:24,920
I'm gonna make sure
something could happen.

803
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:27,040
Pike, take a look at this.

804
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,400
Can you handle that?

805
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:35,320
What I don't know,
I sure as helI am going to learn.

806
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:44,160
My people are here for their guns.

807
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:51,320
You were supposed to be guarding us.

808
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:54,040
I never heard them, didn't even see them.

809
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:10,720
They apologize and ask you
to forgive them for their lack of trust.

810
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:14,440
But only by caution do they remain alive.

811
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,920
Tell them not to break that fuse.

812
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:26,000
These people from your village?

813
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:29,040
They are part of the village,
but not from it.

814
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:32,400
They are puro Indio and these mountains
belong to them.

815
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:47,840
We'll meet again soon.

816
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,880
I'd say those fellows know
how to handle themselves.

817
01:35:57,880 --> 01:35:59,680
They've fought Apaches for 1 ,000 years.

818
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,480
That's a sure way to learn.

819
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:05,120
If they ever get armed,
this whole country will go up in smoke.

820
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:08,040
That it will, son. That it will.

821
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,600
They made damn fools out of us.

822
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:17,000
A man can't sleep with both eyes closed
for fear of getting his throat cut.

823
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:19,480
Where were you?

824
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:21,240
You listen to me.

825
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:25,480
If you got up and helped once in a while,
I wouldn't have got caught so easy.

826
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:44,080
With the new guns and ammunition,
this couldn't have happened.

827
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,400
Swing your leaders wide, old man!

828
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,040
Bring them on!

829
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,280
Come on, horse!

830
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,200
Hold up!

831
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,720
Whoa there!

832
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,280
Mapache's?

833
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,920
Let's hope they aren't Villa's.

834
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,280
We are friends.

835
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:07,720
We are from el General Mapache.

836
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,600
Tell the one in front to come here.

837
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:10,920
Alone.

838
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:17,760
I am coming.

839
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,160
I am your friend, remember?

840
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,480
We are friends.

841
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:26,080
All of us.

842
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,400
I bring you love and affection
from el General.

843
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:35,760
You bring the guns with you?

844
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:40,520
What bravery you have done!

845
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,800
I am to escort you to the General.

846
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:47,360
Tell him to come closer.

847
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,720
I hear.

848
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:51,160
I am coming, my friend.

849
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:56,840
Recognize this?

850
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:07,320
Any trouble, no guns for the General.

851
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:15,560
Very smart!

852
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:18,200
That's very smart for you damn gringos.

853
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:21,320
So nobody can rob the guns.

854
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:22,760
Nobody.

855
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:24,480
I am not afraid.

856
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,360
They are not afraid.

857
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,680
You blow up the wagon, you die.

858
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:30,920
Or we kill you pretty soon.

859
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:32,960
But we are amigos.

860
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:34,680
Show them, boys.

861
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:48,760
Start the ball, Tector.

862
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:59,480
Please, cut the fuse.

863
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:06,120
Please.

864
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:42,560
El General waits in Agua Verde
to meet with you.

865
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:46,040
Tell the General one of us
will be there to trade tomorrow.

866
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:48,400
Any trouble...

867
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,080
...no guns.

868
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:05,160
Damn gringos!

869
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,280
Get them up there! Get them over!

870
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:17,880
Did you bring the guns?

871
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:20,080
Don't worry, we've got them.

872
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,240
Hidden.

873
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:26,880
When I get my share of the gold,
$2,500 dollars' worth...

874
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:29,480
...I'll tell you where four cases are.

875
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:33,320
The others are waiting for me
at the wagon.

876
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:36,480
If I don't show up pretty quick,
they'll blow it.

877
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:39,320
You fix it goddamn good, no?
You fooled me.

878
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:43,360
Our accountant will pay you immediately.

879
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:47,280
When do we get our guns?

880
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:50,720
The quicker I get back,
the quicker you get the next load.

881
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,000
Open it up.

882
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:10,080
Up the arroyo, about two miles...

883
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:12,480
...you'll find three cases of rifles...

884
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:15,560
...and one case of ammunition
hidden in the bush.

885
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:25,200
I understand you have a machine gun.

886
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:30,360
Our contact called for 1 6 cases of rifles...

887
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,800
...and ammunition for $1 0,000.

888
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,680
Not a machine gun.

889
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:40,720
That's our present to the General.

890
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:44,920
Gringo, you fight with Mapache....

891
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:48,160
There's a lot of money and pretty girls.

892
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,960
I'lI think about it.

893
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:54,960
In case he don't find them....

894
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:56,280
Go.

895
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:57,840
I trust him.

896
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,560
Why don't you stir up some grub?

897
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,640
Why don't you go to hell?

898
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,240
Shit!

899
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:43,960
Damn it!

900
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:47,840
Damn it, Pike must've found you
under a rock.

901
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:50,320
You gonna whip me?

902
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:51,520
Nope.

903
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:54,520
But you better hope
I don't get riled enough...

904
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:56,880
...to dog you when this is over.

905
01:44:56,920 --> 01:45:00,360
You're not going to get a chance
to dry gulch me, old man.

906
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,000
We'lI see.

907
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:04,400
We'lI see.

908
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,400
Pike's coming!

909
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,120
He's got it. Carrying gold.

910
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:18,360
Any trouble?

911
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,680
Just from carrying this weight.

912
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,600
Pike, I want to go next.

913
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:27,960
You and Lyle take the next load,
with the machine gun.

914
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:31,680
Then Angel and Dutch. Freddy, you follow
and get the pack horses.

915
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:41,080
lt must be mounted on a tripod!

916
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,040
Crazy bastards!

917
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,720
Put it on the tripod!

918
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,680
We brought the last of it, General.

919
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:14,640
At the head of the arroyo, in the wagon.

920
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:24,160
Keep the wagon, we'll keep the horses.

921
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:29,200
How many cases did you take
from the train?

922
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:33,080
Sixteen cases of rifles.
We lost one on the trail.

923
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:35,120
He stole it.

924
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:38,680
The mother of the girl he killed told me.

925
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:44,360
Don't kill him!

926
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:46,120
I want him alive!

927
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,320
I'm wasting time here.

928
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:39,520
What about Angel?

929
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:49,240
He's a thief. You take care of him.

930
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,720
Well, he had guts.

931
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,120
We're lucky he didn't talk.

932
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:50,720
He played his string right to the end.

933
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:01,440
Her own mama turned him in
like some kind of Judas.

934
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:04,280
Sykes says we should go after him.

935
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:07,280
How will we do that?
They got guns and 200 men.

936
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:09,840
No way.

937
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:11,920
No way at all.

938
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:14,320
ls that Sykes?

939
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:41,080
Mapache!

940
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,920
Thornton.

941
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:51,360
I got him.

942
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:56,400
They got Freddy.

943
01:51:57,680 --> 01:51:59,480
He looks hit pretty bad.

944
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,840
Damn that Deke Thornton to hell!

945
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:04,400
What would you do? He gave his word.

946
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:07,080
Gave his word to a railroad.

947
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:07,880
It's his word!

948
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:10,920
That ain't what counts!
It's who you give it to!

949
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:21,080
We can stay up here
and kick hell out of them !

950
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:27,600
No, we're running out of water.

951
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:30,400
Make a run for the border?

952
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:34,640
They'd follow us every step of the way.
I know Thornton.

953
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:37,600
I'm tired of being hunted.

954
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:42,160
Let's go to Agua Verde.
Let the General take care of those boys.

955
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:44,880
You're crazy.

956
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:48,680
He would just as soon kill us
as break wind.

957
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:53,040
He's so tickled with those guns, he'll be
celebrating and happy to do us a favor.

958
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:55,920
Thornton won't follow us in there.

959
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:59,480
While they're picking over Freddy...

960
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:02,360
...we'll find a back trail and head for town.

961
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:07,360
What about our gold?

962
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,960
We'll take one sack to pay our way.

963
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:19,120
Bury the rest.

964
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:23,720
Together.

965
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:42,920
Look out!

966
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:52,560
Lots of blood, then it stops. No tracks.

967
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:55,280
Ten dollars says he's dead by now.

968
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:57,680
Take us a day to find him if he is.

969
01:53:57,680 --> 01:54:00,240
If not, he has a gun on us right now.

970
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,680
Let's find the others.

971
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:09,240
Just leave him here? He's worth money.

972
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:13,680
Ride out tomorrow, if you can stay
on your horse, and watch the buzzards.

973
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:15,600
They'll show you.

974
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:17,440
What if he ain't dead?

975
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:19,240
That's your problem.

976
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:20,680
Let's go!

977
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:50,080
I hate to see that.

978
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:51,880
No more than I do.

979
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:17,000
Welcome amigos!
You come for your friend, no?

980
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:28,480
I want to buy him back.

981
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:30,280
Get him up! Quick!

982
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,880
I don't think he looks worth too much.

983
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:44,560
I don't think he'll live long.

984
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:46,480
I'll give haIf my share.

985
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:49,200
I need no gold and I don't sell this one.

986
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:51,880
You've had your fun with him.

987
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:54,720
El General said he was happy
with the guns.

988
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,680
Why don't you go get a drink?

989
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:59,520
Enjoy yourself.
There are women everywhere.

990
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:06,440
Don't be foolish and change his mood.

991
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:48,720
Son of a bitch!

992
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:53,640
Do you want girls?

993
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:02,240
Why not?

994
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,640
There ain't nobody here!

995
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:20,480
There's wagon tracks
and somebody was here!

996
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:23,120
They ain't here now!

997
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:30,600
Army patrol!

998
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:32,560
Coming this way!

999
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:02,880
You said dos for two!

1000
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:05,280
Here's your dos and one to grow on.

1001
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,640
That's all you'll get out of me.

1002
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:10,680
Twelve is more than two.

1003
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:12,960
That's why I said twelve each.

1004
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:39,720
Let's go.

1005
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:51,680
Why not?

1006
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:11,160
Those gringos again.

1007
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:29,040
What do you want?

1008
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:35,520
We want Angel.

1009
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:38,120
You want Angel, no?

1010
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:39,880
All right.

1011
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:42,120
I'm going to give him to you.

1012
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:35,720
Bitch!

1013
02:09:58,360 --> 02:10:00,480
Come on, you lazy bastard!

1014
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:36,880
Give them hell, Pike!

1015
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:44,200
No, Pike!

1016
02:11:37,400 --> 02:11:39,000
Look at them.

1017
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:40,600
Come on.

1018
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:44,000
Wait for me!

1019
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,000
-Come on, let's get all the guns.
-This is fine!

1020
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,480
This is just like a big old picnic!

1021
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Here's a rifle for you.

1022
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:21,080
He's got a gun.

1023
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:26,920
It's them !

1024
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:29,560
It's the Gorches!

1025
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:31,880
Get up there, Coffer. Come on.

1026
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,680
Mr. Thornton...

1027
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:35,400
...it's them.

1028
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:37,120
It is them.

1029
02:12:40,400 --> 02:12:43,400
This boy's got gold in his teeth.
Let me see your knife.

1030
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:45,720
-Here.
-Let me see your knife!

1031
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:51,160
Should we load up?

1032
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:53,560
Do we wait for Jess or meet him?

1033
02:12:53,560 --> 02:12:57,560
If he's waiting for buzzards to lead
him to Sykes, he's got a long wait.

1034
02:12:58,360 --> 02:13:00,320
Look! We got them all.

1035
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:02,320
There he is.

1036
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:04,160
There's Pike.

1037
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:07,680
There, you ain't so damned much now,
are you, Mr. Pike?

1038
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:16,320
You ain't coming?

1039
02:13:22,360 --> 02:13:24,640
Maybe we should wait for Jess.

1040
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:28,240
No, we pick him up on the way.

1041
02:13:28,360 --> 02:13:30,160
I want to get out of this damn place.

1042
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:33,160
Anyway, these boys'll start going ripe
by tomorrow.

1043
02:13:33,160 --> 02:13:34,840
We got to move.

1044
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:40,960
"I went to the river
and I couldn't get across

1045
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:43,720
"Singing 'polly wolly doodle' all the day

1046
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:46,960
"I jumped on a buzzard 'cause
I thought he was a horse

1047
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:49,360
"Singing 'polly wolly doodle' all the day

1048
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:51,160
"Fare thee well"

1049
02:15:19,480 --> 02:15:22,280
-Didn't expect to find you here.
-Why not?

1050
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:24,240
I sent them back.

1051
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:26,680
That's all I said I'd do.

1052
02:15:26,680 --> 02:15:28,560
They didn't get far.

1053
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:30,560
I figured.

1054
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:35,160
What are your plans?

1055
02:15:36,280 --> 02:15:38,080
Drift around down here.

1056
02:15:38,080 --> 02:15:40,120
Try to stay out of jail.

1057
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:43,320
Well, me and the boys here...

1058
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:45,880
...got work to do.

1059
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:51,680
Want to come?

1060
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:55,400
Ain't like it used to be, but...

1061
02:15:56,040 --> 02:15:57,600
...it'll do.
