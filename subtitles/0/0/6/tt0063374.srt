1
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
- Room, please?
- You alone?

2
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,900
Luggage?

3
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,500
- How long you want it for?
- Not very long.

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,400
$ 5.

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
$ 5.

6
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,100
307.

7
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,900
Haven't you anything higher?

8
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,300
Higher?

9
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,800
914?

10
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,800
Good night.

11
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,700
Goodbye.

12
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh, no. Oh, no.

13
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,300
- Ante.
- Ante up.

14
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,200
Aren't you the one they call
the Cincinnati Kid?

15
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,400
You don't like it? Get a machine.

16
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,000
- It stinks in here.
- What time is it?

17
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,900
- Again?
- My watch is slow.

18
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,100
You're winning $ 95. That's what time.
Where are you running?

19
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,700
- Nowhere. I just asked the time.
- It's 10:30.

20
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,600
I gotta leave by 12:00.
I told you when I sat down.

21
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,100
Murray, didn't I say
I got leave by 12:00?

22
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,800
Don't talk to him, he's dealing.

23
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,700
Want a rest for a while?
Go lie down, sweetheart.

24
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,400
You want speed or accuracy?
Make up your mind.

25
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,700
You wanna do me a really big favour?
Smoke towards New Jersey.

26
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,400
I'm really worried about Felix.
He's never been this late.

27
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,400
Maybe somebody should call.
Oscar. Why don't you call Felix?

28
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,500
Why don't we chip in and buy
another window? You can't breathe.

29
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,600
How many cards you got? Four?

30
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,100
We all have four cards.
Give us one more and we'll have five.

31
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,800
Two more, we'll have six.
Understand how it works?

32
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,900
Is Oscar playing or not?

33
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,700
- Hey, Oscar!
- Yeah?

34
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,500
- You in or out?
- Out, pussycat, out.

35
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,800
I told my wife I'd be home
by 1:00 at the latest.

36
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,900
We're on an eight o'clock
plane to Florida.

37
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,800
Who goes to Florida in July?

38
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,600
It's off season. There's no crowds.

39
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,500
The best room is one-tenth
the price. No cards.

40
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,200
Some vacation.
Six people in an empty hotel.

41
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,200
Dealer takes four.
You think maybe Felix is sick?

42
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,200
I mean he's never been this late before.

43
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,900
This is the same garbage from last week.
I'm recognising things.

44
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,400
I'm out.

45
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,600
- Two kings.
- Straight.

46
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,100
Maybe he's in his office,
locked in the john again.

47
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,800
Did you know Felix was once locked
in the john overnight?

48
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,000
He wrote his entire will
on half a roll of toilet paper. What a nut!

49
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Don't play with your chips.
I'm asking you nice.

50
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,500
I'm not playing. I'm counting.
Leave me alone.

51
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,800
I can't stand a guy who's winning
who plays with his chips.

52
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,500
This is my house. You wanna play
with your chips, you play with them.

53
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,200
I'm in for a quarter.

54
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,400
Aren't you gonna look
at your cards first?

55
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,300
I'm gonna bluff anyway.
Who gets the Pepsi?

56
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,100
Murray, the policeman,
gets a warm Pepsi.

57
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,500
You didn't fix the refrigerator?
It's been two weeks. No wonder it stinks.

58
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,200
Temper. If I wanted nagging,
I'd go back with my wife.

59
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,400
- I'm out. Who wants food?
- What you got?

60
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,100
Brown sandwiches
and green sandwiches.

61
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,400
- Which one do you want?
- What's the green?

62
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,100
It's either very new cheese
or very old meat.

63
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,600
I'll take brown.

64
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,200
- You're not gonna eat that?
- I'm hungry.

65
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,200
His refrigerator's out of order. I saw milk
standing that wasn't even in a bottle!

66
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,800
Are you some kind of health nut?
Eat, Murray.

67
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,000
- I got six cards.
- That figures. I got three aces.

68
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,100
- Misdeal.
- Peanuts?

69
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,100
Felix makes good sandwiches.

70
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,400
Did you taste his cream cheese
and pimento on date nut bread?

71
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,900
Make up your mind,
poker or recipes.

72
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,800
You've got beer all over my glasses!

73
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,700
You got it on the chips.

74
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,300
It's all over me now!

75
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,700
What is this?

76
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,100
Don't put it in the middle of the table.

77
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,200
How can you play like this?

78
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,100
Let's play some poker here.

79
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,200
Who's playing here?

80
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,400
Vinnie, tell Oscar
what time you're leaving.

81
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,700
Twelve o'clock.

82
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,900
We got ten minutes before the next
announcement. This is five card stud.

83
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,400
Five card stud.

84
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,900
A red lady, a deuce, quatro,
a big ace for the policeman.

85
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,700
Wait, the pot's shy.
Who didn't put in a quarter?

86
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,300
- You didn't.
- You got a big mouth. Lend me $ 20.

87
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,900
I just loaned you $ 20.
Ask somebody else.

88
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,100
I'm winning my own money back.

89
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,800
You owe everybody.
If you don't have it, don't play.

90
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm through being the nice guy.
You owe me $ 6 apiece for the buffet.

91
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,800
What buffet?

92
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,900
Hot beer and two sandwiches left
from when you went to high school.

93
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,600
What do you want?
A tomato surprise?

94
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,000
Lend me $ 20 or I'll tell your wife
you're in Central Park wearing a dress.

95
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,000
Maybe that's Felix.

96
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,400
- Pair o' sixes.
- Three deuces.

97
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,800
Why didn't you go to Florida last night?

98
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,600
Oscar, the Poker player.

99
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,400
If that's my wife,
tell her I'm leaving at 12:00.

100
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,700
Look at your watch once more,
you get peanuts in your face. Deal.

101
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,200
Talk up. Who?

102
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,300
Oh, Daddy.
For crying out loud, it's my kid.

103
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,000
Brucey, how are you, baby?

104
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,100
No, I couldn't. There's a lot
of boys here. We're playing.

105
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,900
Boys, fellas.
Give me a break, will you?

106
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,100
My kid is calling from California.
It must be costing a fortune.

107
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,300
How have you been, honey?
Yes, I got your letter.

108
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,800
Yes, it took three weeks.

109
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,400
Next time
tell Mommy to give you a stamp.

110
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,500
Yeah, I know, Honey,
but you're not supposed to draw it on.

111
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,100
- Hey, you hear this?
- We hear. We're all thrilled.

112
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,600
Mommy wants to talk to me?
All right, sweetheart.

113
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,000
I love you, soldier. Goodbye.

114
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,500
Ante a dollar.

115
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,300
- You got a dollar to play, Oscar?
- Not after I've talked to this lady.

116
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,600
Hello, Blanche, how are you?

117
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,800
Yeah, you're calling because
I'm a week behind with the cheque, right?

118
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,100
Four weeks? It's not possible.

119
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,100
I keep a record of every cheque
in my files here

120
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,500
and I happen to know
I'm only three weeks behind.

121
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,400
Don't threaten me with jail, Blanche,
because it's not a threat.

122
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,900
With my expenses and my alimony,
a prisoner gets more pay than me.

123
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,400
Very nice language
in front of the children.

124
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
I'm $ 800 behind in alimony!
Let's raise the stakes.

125
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,700
She can do it, you know?
Throw you in jail.

126
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,800
If she can't aggravate me,
she's not happy.

127
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Aren't you worried about the kids?

128
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,800
They live in their grandfather's house
in California. Can we play?

129
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,800
I said you'd get into trouble.
You can't manage anything.

130
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,100
- I know. I'm your accountant.
- Then why do I need money?

131
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,700
- Why do you play poker?
- I need money.

132
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,500
- You always lose.
- That's why I need the money.

133
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,200
- Then don't play.
- Then don't eat my potato chips.

134
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,300
Beautiful, beautiful.

135
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,700
What are you yelling about?
This is a friendly game.

136
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,800
We've been sitting here
talking since eight o'clock.

137
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,100
Since 7:00.
That's why I said I'd quit at 12:00.

138
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,900
How would you like a stale banana
right in the mouth?

139
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,700
Calm down. Take it easy.

140
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,200
I'm a cop, I could arrest
the whole lousy game.

141
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,700
Murray is right.

142
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,700
Let's play cards and hold them up.
I can't see where I marked them.

143
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,200
He owes money to his wife,
government, friends and still isn't serious.

144
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,200
Life goes on for those
who are divorced, broke and sloppy.

145
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,400
Hello, Divorced, Broke and Sloppy.

146
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,300
Hello, sweetheart. Yes, darling.

147
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,500
You know I do, darling.
Yeah? Hold on, just a second.

148
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,200
Murray, it's your wife.

149
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,100
If you were having an affair with her,
she wouldn't bother me all the time.

150
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,700
Hello, Mimi.

151
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,400
When are you coming home?
About 12:00, 12:30.

152
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,200
About 12:00, 12:30.
What do you want?

153
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,100
A corned beef sandwich
and a strawberry malted?

154
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,700
- Is she pregnant again?
- No, just fat.

155
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,700
How could you hear?
I had the phone over my chest.

156
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,600
Felix? No, he didn't show up tonight.

157
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:13,300
What's wrong? You're kidding?
How should I know?

158
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,600
All right, Mimi.
I'll take care of it. Goodbye.

159
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,900
- Felix is missing.
- What do you mean?

160
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,400
He didn't show up for work.
Nobody knows where he is.

161
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,500
- Mimi spoke to his wife.
- No one is missing for one day.

162
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,100
Maybe he had an accident. If he's laying
in a gutter, who'd know who he is?

163
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,900
He's got 92 credit cards in his wallet.

164
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,100
The minute something happens to him,
America lights up. I'll call his wife.

165
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,400
I thought he looked edgy
the last few weeks, didn't you?

166
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,900
No. I thought you looked edgy.

167
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,900
Frances, how are you?
Oscar. Yeah, I just heard.

168
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,100
Tell her not to worry.
She's probably hysterical.

169
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,000
Frances, the most important thing
is not to worry.

170
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,900
She's not worried.

171
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,500
Do you have any idea where he could be?

172
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,500
He what? You're kidding?

173
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:19,400
I didn't know. He never told me.
Yeah, all right.

174
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,600
Listen, Frances, you just sit tight.

175
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,600
The minute I hear anything
I'll let you know. OK, goodbye.

176
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,000
You gonna tell us
or do we hire a private detective?

177
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,600
- They broke up.
- Who?

178
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,800
Who? Felix and Frances is '"who'".
They broke up.

179
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,200
- The entire marriage is through.
- You're kidding!

180
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,300
After 12 years?

181
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,400
They were such a happy couple.

182
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,600
He'll go to pieces. I know Felix.
He'll try something crazy.

183
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,300
All he talked about
was his wife and kids.

184
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,900
He'll kill himself.
You hear?

185
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,900
Shut up.
Stop being a cop for two minutes.

186
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,000
- Where did he go?
- He went out to kill himself.

187
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,800
- What did I tell you?
- Are you serious?

188
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,300
She said he didn't want to do it at home
because the kids were sleeping.

189
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,600
- Why?
- He's a nut, that's why.

190
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,500
But did he say it in those words?

191
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,300
I don't know.
She didn't read it to me.

192
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,500
- He left her a note?
- He sent a telegram.

193
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
- Who sends a suicide telegram?
- Felix, the nut.

194
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,100
Can you imagine that?
She even has to tip the kid a quarter.

195
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,650
Ah!

196
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Maybe he's just bluffing.
We get these cases every day.

197
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,000
All they want is a little sympathy.

198
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,400
You never can tell what
a guy will do when he's hysterical.

199
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,700
Nine times out of ten, they don't jump.

200
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,000
- And the tenth time?
- He's right. There's a possibility.

201
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,400
I know Felix.
He's too nervous to kill himself.

202
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,900
He wears his seat belt
in drive-in movies.

203
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,700
If you're gonna kill yourself,
where's the safest place to do it?

204
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,100
With your friends.
Vinnie, open the door.

205
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,300
He may be hysterical.
If we're calm, he'll be calm.

206
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,200
That's what they do.
They talk nice and soft.

207
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,900
- What do we say?
- Nothing, like we never heard a thing.

208
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,700
Are you through? He already
could've hung himself in the hall.

209
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,700
- Vinnie, open the door.
- Remember, like we know nothing.

210
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,300
- Oh hi, Felix.
- Hi.

211
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,600
Hey, fellas.

212
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,800
- Hi.
- Hi, Felix.

213
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,900
- How's the game going?
- Good.

214
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
- Very nice.
- Good.

215
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,900
I'm sorry, I'm late.

216
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,700
Is there any...ginger ale left?

217
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,100
Ginger ale? I don't think so.
I got some root beer.

218
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,600
Nope. I felt like a ginger ale.

219
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,600
Somehow I don't feel like a root beer...

220
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,500
...tonight.

221
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,300
What's the bet?

222
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,400
You bet a quarter. It's up to Murray.
Murray, what do you say?

223
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,700
- Murray...Murray?
- Tap his shoulder.

224
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,500
- What?
- It's up to you.

225
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,100
- Why is it always up to me?
- It's up to you now.

226
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,800
- What do you do?
- I'm in, I'm in.

227
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,500
Anybody call about me?

228
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,600
Call...about you?
No, not that I can remember.

229
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,900
Were you expecting...
Did anyone call for Felix?

230
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,500
No.

231
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,200
- Were you expecting a call?
- No, I was just asking.

232
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,500
I raise a dollar.

233
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,900
Costs me a dollar
and a quarter, right?

234
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,300
I just thought that somebody
might have called.

235
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,400
If nobody called, nobody called.

236
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,700
- What does it cost to play again?
- A dollar and a quarter. Pay attention.

237
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,900
- All right, take it easy.
- Calm down, everyone.

238
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,700
I can't help it.
He makes me nervous.

239
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
- You make everybody nervous.
- I'm sorry. I'll kill myself.

240
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,800
- Murray!
- I'm sorry.

241
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,900
That's a pretty view from here.
What is it, 12 floors?

242
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,400
No, it's only 11 floors, that's all.

243
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:49,600
See, it's only 11 floors.
It says 12 but it's really only 11 .

244
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
Gee, it's chilly in here.

245
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,700
- Isn't it chilly in here?
- Yes it is, very chilly.

246
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,400
- Want to play Felix? It's still early.
- We're in no rush.

247
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,800
We'll be here
till 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning.

248
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,200
I don't know. I just don't feel
much like playing right now.

249
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,600
What do you feel like doing?

250
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,200
I don't know.
I'll think of something.

251
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,600
- Where are you going?
- To the john.

252
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:41,500
- Alone?
- I always go alone. Why?

253
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,700
No reason.
You gonna be in there long?

254
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,000
Long as it takes.

255
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,700
Are you crazy,
letting him go alone?

256
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,900
- Suppose he tries to kill himself?
- In the john?

257
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,100
Razor blades, poison,
anything that's in there.

258
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,900
That's the kid's bathroom. The worst
he could do is brush his teeth to death.

259
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,500
He could jump.

260
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,300
- Isn't there a window in there?
- It's only six inches wide.

261
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,300
He could break the glass,
and cut his wrists.

262
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,900
And flush himself into the East River.

263
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,500
- He won't try anything.
- Listen.

264
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,600
He's crying.

265
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,200
You hear that, he's crying.

266
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,200
Isn't that terrible? For God's sakes,
Oscar, say something.

267
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,400
What do you say to a man
who's crying in your bathroom?

268
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,500
He's coming!

269
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,400
Well, I guess I'll just be running along...

270
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,600
Felix, wait a second!

271
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,400
No, I can't talk to you.
I can't talk to anyone.

272
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,700
Felix, we're your friends.
Don't run out like this.

273
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,300
There's nothing to talk about it.
There's nothing to say. It's over.

274
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,200
- Let me go. Please, leave me alone.
- Let him go.

275
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,200
Stop him!

276
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
- Let's go. Break the door down.
- Break it in.

277
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,700
Felix! He's jumped.
I tell you he jumped.

278
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,400
My back!

279
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,700
My back! My back!

280
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,400
My back! My back!

281
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,500
Will you leave me alone?
Oh, my stomach!

282
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,700
What's the matter with your stomach?

283
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,200
Nothing. I didn't take anything.
Leave me alone.

284
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,200
- What did you take?
- Nothing.

285
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Don't tell Frances what I did.

286
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,400
- He took pills!
- What kind of pills?

287
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,600
I don't know. Little green ones.
Don't call her.

288
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,300
Felix, when did you take these pills?

289
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,000
A couple of hours ago.
You won't call her.

290
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,200
- How many pills did you take?
- I can't remember. A whole bottle and...

291
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,500
A whole bottle of pills!
My God! Get an ambulance.

292
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,800
- We don't know what kind.
- What difference does it make?

293
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,000
- He took a whole bottle.
- Maybe they were vitamins.

294
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,300
He could be the healthiest one here.

295
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,500
Walk him around. Don't let him sleep.

296
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,300
Open the window,
give him some air!

297
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,500
Rub his wrists.
Keep his circulation going.

298
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,900
One doctor at a time.
All the interns, shut the hell up!

299
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,800
You didn't call Frances?

300
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,300
- Get him under the cold shower.
- Vinnie, turn the shower on.

301
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,900
Watch my arm.

302
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,600
Please. Turn it off!

303
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,900
We gotta get the pills out.

304
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,700
The pills are out. I threw up before.

305
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,200
12 years.

306
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,700
Did you know I was married
12 years, Roy?

307
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,400
Yes, Felix. I knew.

308
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,800
It's over like that. That's hysterical.

309
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,300
Maybe it was just a fight.
You've had fights before, Felix.

310
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,700
No, it's over. She's getting
a lawyer tomorrow - my cousin, she is.

311
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,400
- Who am I gonna get?
- It's OK, Felix.

312
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,400
All right, let's not stand around
looking at him. Let's break it up.

313
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,700
Don't stand there looking at me.
I'm ashamed of it.

314
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,100
Let's call it a night.

315
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,500
- It's all right. We understand.
- Don't tell anybody. Promise me.

316
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,400
- I'm going to Florida tomorrow.
- That's nice. Have a good time.

317
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,400
We were going to Florida
next winter without the kids.

318
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,900
Now they're going without me.

319
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,500
OK, come on, boys.

320
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,300
Good night.

321
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,500
- One of us should stay.
- It's OK.

322
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,700
Suppose he tries something again.

323
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,300
- He won't.
- How do you know?

324
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,600
I won't try anything.
I'm very tired.

325
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,400
You hear? He's very tired,
he's had a busy night. Good night, fellas.

326
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,100
Good night.

327
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,200
If anything happens, Oscar, just call me.

328
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,100
I'm three blocks away.
I could be here in five minutes.

329
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,600
If you need me, I'll be
at the Meridian Motel, Miami Beach.

330
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,400
- You'll be the first one I call, Vinnie.
- Good.

331
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,400
- Oscar.
- Yeah?

332
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,400
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

333
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,800
Good night, Felix.
Get a good night's sleep.

334
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,700
Things will look brighter in the morning.

335
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,700
Take away his belt and his shoelaces.

336
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,900
Felix, Felix...

337
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,600
- Felix, Felix.
- I know. I know!

338
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,400
I know!

339
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,600
Oscar, what am I gonna do?

340
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,300
We'll talk about it later.
Get something to eat first.

341
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Would you like some hot Ovaltine?

342
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,500
The thing is I still love her.
I always loved her.

343
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,900
How about vanilla wafers
or Vienna fingers, or Mallomars?

344
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,300
A nice box of chocolate Mallomars?
I got everything.

345
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,200
We had so much together.
Two beautiful kids, a beautiful home.

346
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,500
Whoever had more beautiful kids
or a more beautiful home?

347
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,700
12 years of marriage
down the drain.

348
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,700
Drains can be fixed. We have plumbers.
Get me a pot under the sink.

349
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,000
It's not fair. Dammit, it's not fair...

350
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,400
- What's the matter?
- I got a nerve spasm in my neck.

351
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,100
Just take it easy.
Show me where it hurts.

352
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,900
- Don't touch me.
- I just want to see where it hurts.

353
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,400
- No, it's tension. I must be tense.
- I wouldn't be surprised.

354
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,600
- Relax, dammit, relax.
- Don't yell at me.

355
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,200
- Does that hurt?
- No, it feels good.

356
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,200
You make the same sounds
for pain or happiness.

357
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,300
I think I'm crazy.

358
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,900
If it makes you feel better,
I think so too.

359
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,200
It doesn't take much. The first sign
of things going wrong, I go to pieces.

360
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
Don't stop. It feels good when you rub.

361
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,000
If you don't relax,
I'm gonna break my fingers.

362
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,100
Look at this - the only man
in the world with clenched hair!

363
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,300
Bend over. Attaboy.
OK, now hold still.

364
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,400
If this hurts, Felix, tell me,
cos I don't know what I'm doing.

365
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,700
- What's that noise?
- I can't breathe in here.

366
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,500
It must be the dust.
Open the window.

367
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,600
We're not opening
any windows on the 11th floor.

368
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,400
To get some fresh air
we'll go downstairs for a walk.

369
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:20,300
I wish I were like you, Oscar, strong.
But I'm weak and I admit it.

370
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:25,000
You'll outlive today's entire generation.
You want a lick?

371
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,700
You don't understand.
I'm nothing without my wife and kids.

372
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You're not nothing.
You're something. You're a person.

373
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,100
You're flesh and blood,
bones, hair, nails and ears.

374
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,000
You're not a fish,
you're not a buffalo, you're you.

375
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,500
You walk and talk and cry and complain

376
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,300
and eat little green pills
and send suicide telegrams.

377
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,300
No one else does that.

378
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,900
I'm telling you, you're the only one
of its kind in the world!

379
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,000
You stained me!

380
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,900
Chocolate ice cream stains.
That's a stain.

381
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,800
Ice cream doesn't stain.

382
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,000
Vanilla and coffee don't stain,
chocolate does! That's a stain!

383
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,600
Felix, leave that alone, will you?
Or you'll get a water stain.

384
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,200
That won't come out.
That's permanent.

385
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,300
You ready to order now? Oh, hi!

386
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,900
My little pussycat.
Come here, darling.

387
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,600
For a tip I'll leave you the key
to my apartment.

388
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,700
Is it informal or can I bring my husband?

389
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,700
I can't wait that long. How about five
minutes behind the cash register?

390
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,400
If you bite, I can't write!
What'll you have?

391
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,900
A cup of hot tea, please.

392
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,800
Hot tea for Diamond Jim Brady.

393
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,200
Are you gonna eat anything?

394
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,600
I just had an ice cream.

395
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,300
Give me a corn beef on rye, all fat

396
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,800
and a high calorie cream soda.

397
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,100
Ain't she cute?

398
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,800
If you don't try,
how are you gonna find out?

399
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,100
Easy for you and me.
We're men, we're out in the world.

400
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,900
We can meet new people.
What about Frances?

401
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,700
What about Frances?

402
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,900
It's harder on the woman. She's alone
with the kids. She can't get out like me.

403
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,600
How will she meet somebody,
with two kids, and where?

404
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,600
Maybe someone
will come to the door.

405
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,800
- Stop talking about Frances.
- Do you want me to forget about her?

406
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,300
How do you wipe out 12 years
of marriage just like that?

407
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,700
Face it. You can't spend your life crying.
It annoys people in the movies.

408
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,600
- What's the matter?
- I'm cold. It's the air-conditioning.

409
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,100
- Why is it so high? I'll probably get flu.
- You want a blanket?

410
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,700
You've got to be careful
with air conditioning.

411
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,500
I never let Frances turn ours on
in the summer.

412
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,100
She must be crazy about that.

413
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,600
Let's move to another table.

414
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,900
I knew it.

415
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,100
What's the matter now?

416
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,600
I got this...my ears are filling up.
I got this sinus condition.

417
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,700
It's the change in temperature.
I always get it from air-conditioning.

418
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,600
Maybe it'll go away.

419
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,600
It's part of my allergies.
I get them in summer.

420
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,700
- Only in summer?
- And winter too. All year long.

421
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,600
I'm allergic to foods, pillows,
curtains and perfumes.

422
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,700
Can you imagine that?
That used to drive Frances crazy.

423
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,700
For a while she couldn't wear
anything except my aftershave lotion.

424
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,400
I was impossible to live with.

425
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,700
Stop that.
What are you doing?

426
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,300
I'm trying to clear up my ears.

427
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:57,200
You create a pressure inside your head.
It opens the Eustachian tubes.

428
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,800
- Did it open up?
- I think I strained my throat.

429
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,900
Leave yourself alone?
Don't tinker.

430
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,100
I know. I can't help it.
I drive everybody crazy.

431
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,600
A marriage counsellor
once kicked me out

432
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,600
and wrote on my chart '"lunatic'".

433
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,700
It takes two to make a rotten marriage.

434
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,500
You don't know what I was like at home.

435
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,700
I'm a compulsive cleaner.
Always cleaning up after Frances.

436
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,900
Then I'd re-cook her meals
because I'm a much better cook.

437
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,200
I cooked myself right out
of a marriage. Stupid damned idiot.

438
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,700
Hey, Felix, don't do that.
You'll get a headache.

439
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,400
I can't stand it any more. It's just...

440
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:21,300
- I hate me. Boy, do I hate me!
- You don't hate you, you love you.

441
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,400
- You think no one else has problems.
- I thought you were my friend.

442
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,800
I am. I can talk to you this way because
I love you almost as much as you do.

443
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,300
- Then why don't you help?
- Help you? I can't even help myself.

444
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,000
You think you're impossible to live with?

445
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,000
Blanche would ask, '"When do you
want dinner?'" I'd say, '"I'm not hungry.'"

446
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,500
Then, three o'clock in the morning,
I'd wake her up and say, '"Now!'"

447
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,300
I've been one of the highest paid
sports writers for 14 years.

448
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,300
We saved $ 8.50 in pennies.

449
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,000
I'm never home. I gamble.
I drink like a fish.

450
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,600
Lie to her every chance I get.

451
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,000
For our wedding anniversary I took her
to the New York vs. Detroit hockey game.

452
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
She got hit by a puck.

453
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,700
I still can't figure out why she left me.
That's how impossible I am.

454
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,100
Let's get out of here.
The muggers will be here soon.

455
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,700
I don't think I can take it
living alone, Oscar.

456
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,600
In two weeks I'll go to pieces.
How will I work and make a living?

457
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,700
Cry on street corners.
They'll throw you nickels. You'll work.

458
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,900
Tonight, you'll sleep here.

459
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,300
Tomorrow get your clothes
and toothbrush and move in with me.

460
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,400
It's your apartment.
I'll just be in the way.

461
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,000
There's eight rooms. We could go
a year without seeing each other.

462
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,500
Don't you understand?
I want you to move in.

463
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,500
- Why? I'm a pest.
- You don't have to keep telling me.

464
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,000
Then why do you want me to move in?

465
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,700
I can't stand living alone, that's why.

466
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,100
I'm proposing.
What do you want, a ring?

467
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,100
If you really mean it.
There's a lot I can do.

468
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,900
I'm very handy around the house.
I know how to fix things.

469
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,000
- I fixed my wife's hairdryer.
- I don't have one. Blanche took it.

470
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,700
Let me do something.
I got to do something.

471
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,200
You can take my wife's initials
off the towels. Anything you say.

472
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,400
You can sleep in Brucey's room.

473
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,200
I can cook, you know.
I'm a terrific cook.

474
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,500
You don't have to.
I got enough potato chips to last a year.

475
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,000
Two meals a day? At home?
We'll save a fortune.

476
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,800
- We got to pay alimony.
- OK, you can cook.

477
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,900
You like leg of lamb?
I'll make it this weekend.

478
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,200
I got to call Frances.
She's got my big pot.

479
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,800
Will you forget Frances?
We'll get our own pots.

480
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,700
Don't drive me crazy
before you move in.

481
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Listen, Oscar.

482
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,000
If I do anything that irritates you,
don't be afraid to tell me.

483
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,100
It's your apartment.
I don't want to get on your nerves.

484
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,400
- Hello, Frances.
- I'm not here.

485
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,000
You haven't heard from me.
You didn't see me. And I'm not here.

486
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,300
Yes, he's here.

487
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:07,000
Is she worried?
What's she saying? Is she crying?

488
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,500
Does she want to speak...
I don't want to talk to her.

489
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,900
He's gonna stay here with me.

490
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,900
And you can tell her,
I'm not coming back.

491
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,000
And I've taken as much as she has.
I'm human too, you know.

492
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,500
She's not the only one
that's suffered in this marriage. Tell her!

493
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,100
- He's fine.
- Don't tell her I'm fine.

494
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,900
I was gonna kill myself.
Why did you say I'm fine?

495
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,300
- I understand.
- Ask if she wants to speak to me.

496
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,100
Do you want to speak to him?
Oh, you don't.

497
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,100
- She doesn't?
- I understand. Good night, Frances.

498
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:46,100
She doesn't want to speak to me?
Why did she call?

499
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,100
She wants to know when
you're collecting your clothes.

500
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,100
She wants to have the room repainted.

501
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,600
Listen, Felix, it's almost one
o'clock. Let's go to bed.

502
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,900
- She didn't want to speak to me.
- I'll get you a pair of pyjamas.

503
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,400
You like stripes, dots or animals?

504
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,600
I wanted to kill myself
and she's picking colours.

505
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,700
How about some house slippers for you?

506
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:15,700
I'm glad. She finally
made me realise it's over.

507
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,100
It didn't sink in till this minute.

508
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,300
Felix, I want you to go to bed.

509
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:25,300
My marriage is really over.
It doesn't seem so bad now.

510
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,600
- I can live with this thing.
- Live with it tomorrow.

511
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,000
- Go to bed tonight.
- In a few minutes.

512
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,200
I got to think and rearrange my life.

513
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,900
Felix, this is my apartment.
I make up the bedtime.

514
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,000
You don't understand. I want to be alone.
Go to bed and I'll clean up.

515
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:45,500
- You don't have to clean up.
- I can't sleep with the room like this.

516
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,200
I'll see you in the morning.
I'll cook breakfast.

517
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:53,800
You're not going to do anything
big like rolling up rugs, are you?

518
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,800
Ten minutes,
that's all I'm gonna be.

519
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,600
I'm gonna do the dishes
and go to bed.

520
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,500
He's gonna do the dishes.

521
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,800
- Hey, Oscar.
- Yeah?

522
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,600
I'm gonna be all right!
It may take a few days.

523
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:18,500
- I'm gonna be all right.
- Good. Good night, Felix.

524
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,100
Good night, Frances.

525
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,400
- Morning, Harry.
- Morning.

526
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,000
Hey, that's my bus.
See you tonight, Oscar.

527
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,800
What'll I make for dinner?

528
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,400
The batter, number
nine, Bill Mazerosky, second base.

529
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,200
Strike!

530
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,500
Well, that's the ball game.

531
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,700
It's not over yet.

532
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,800
Bases loaded, Mazerosky up,
ninth inning -

533
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,200
You expect the Mets
to hold a one-run lead?

534
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,500
What's the matter?
You never heard of a triple play?

535
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,700
Hello.

536
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,300
Phone for you, Madison.

537
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,600
I'll call him back.

538
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,600
He says it's an emergency.

539
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,100
Yeah?

540
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,300
Just called to say don't eat
any frankfurters at the game today.

541
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,000
I'm making franks and beans for dinner.

542
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,900
A triple play! The Mets did it!

543
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,900
It was the greatest fielding play
I ever saw and you missed it!

544
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,500
Are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?

545
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,600
Take your frankfurters and...

546
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,900
Oscar. Hey, Oscar...

547
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,000
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Wipe your feet.

548
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,300
If you know what's good for you,
wipe your feet.

549
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,500
How's the game going?

550
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,300
What happened to the apartment?

551
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,900
It's been given the Good Housekeeping
seal of approval. Deal the cards.

552
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,800
A cold glass of beer for Roy.
Where's your coaster?

553
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,600
- What?
- Your coaster,

554
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,300
the little round
thing that goes under the glass.

555
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,600
I think I bet it.

556
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,900
Here. I knew I was winning too much.

557
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,500
Try to use the coasters.
Scotch and a little bit of water.

558
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:42,700
- And I have my coaster.
- You know what wet glasses do.

559
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,900
- They leave little rings on the table.
- Little rings on the table.

560
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,200
We don't want rings on the table.

561
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,900
And we have a nice
warm sandwich for Vinnie.

562
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,000
It smells good! What is it?

563
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,600
Bacon, lettuce and tomato
with mayonnaise on toast.

564
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,900
- You just made it?
- One, two, three.

565
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,200
You cooked bacon just for me?

566
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,300
Don't like it,
he'll make a meatloaf in five minutes.

567
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,300
Eat over the dish.
I just vacuumed the rug.

568
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,600
- That's good.
- Oscar, what did you want?

569
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,600
Two three and a half minute eggs
and petits fours.

570
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,600
Double gin and tonic, right?
Be with you in a minute.

571
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,900
- Who turned off the de-humidifier?
- The what?

572
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:25,700
I said don't play with it.
I'm trying to get the grime out of the air.

573
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:29,400
Murray, I'll give you $ 200
for your gun.

574
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
I can't take any more.

575
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:36,200
We've played four minutes of poker.
I'm not watching cooking and cleaning.

576
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,400
I can't breathe. That lousy machine
is sucking everything out of the air.

577
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:44,200
- This is delicious. Who wants a bite?
- I didn't have any supper. Is it warm?

578
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,400
- Perfect! It's a well-made sandwich.
- Cut me a little piece.

579
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,200
Give me your napkin.
I don't want to drop any crumbs.

580
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,400
Martha and Gertrude at the Automat.

581
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:57,100
That thing could kill us. They'll find us
with our tongues on the floor.

582
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,400
Do something, Oscar.
Get him back into the game.

583
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,900
Don't come to me with problems.
You get this one night a week.

584
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,500
I'm cooped up with Mary Poppins
24 hours a day.

585
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,100
- Felix, get in here, will you?
- Coming!

586
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,600
It was better before
with the garbage and the smoke.

587
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,400
Did you notice
what he does with the bread?

588
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,000
He cuts off the crusts.
That's why the sandwich is light.

589
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,500
And he only uses the soft part
of the lettuce. It's delicious.

590
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,500
- I'm going out of my mind.
- Felix, get in here.

591
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,200
I'm going home.

592
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,500
The day his marriage busted up
was the end of our poker game.

593
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,100
You can't run out now.
I'm a big loser.

594
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,700
You got no one to blame but yourself.

595
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
You're the one who stopped
him from killing himself.

596
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,700
He's right. That man is absolutely right.

597
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,700
- Are you gonna eat that pickle?
- Why? Do you want it?

598
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,900
- Unless you want it.
- Take it. I don't usually eat pickle.

599
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,500
- Deal the cards.
- Why did you do that?

600
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,100
You want to play poker, deal the cards.
You want to eat, go to a delicatessen.

601
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,200
Keep your pickle
and sandwiches to yourself.

602
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,300
I'm losing $ 53 here
and everybody's getting fat.

603
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,100
What?

604
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,500
Close the stinking restaurant.
We got a poker game going on.

605
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,700
Is it up to me?
Who threw a pickle on the floor?

606
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,500
I don't think that's funny.

607
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,100
What is that smell? Disinfectant?

608
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,700
It's the cards.
He washed the cards.

609
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,200
I'm getting out of here.
I can't stand any more.

610
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,400
Where are you going?

611
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,600
I've been breathing cleaning fluid
and ammonia for three hours.

612
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,400
Nature didn't intend for poker
to be played like that.

613
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,400
OK, ready to play.

614
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,200
- We got just enough for handball.
- Where is everybody?

615
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,000
You got the nerve to ask?
I've just been sterilised out of $ 53.

616
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,500
I'm sorry. Is it my fault, fellas?

617
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,700
I guess no one feels
like playing tonight.

618
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,300
I better be going too.
Got to get up early.

619
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,300
Bebe and I are driving
to Asbury Park for the weekend.

620
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,000
That's nice. You always
do things like that together.

621
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,400
We have to. I don't know how to drive.
You coming, Murray?

622
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,800
Yeah, why not?

623
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,000
I got to stop and get Mimi
a hero sandwich and a frozen clair.

624
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,700
Marriage! Those two playboys
sure got the life.

625
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,600
Some life those playboys got.

626
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,600
That's funny, isn't it. Oscar?
They think we're happy.

627
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,400
They think we're enjoying ourselves.

628
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,700
They just don't know
what it's like living alone.

629
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,600
I'd be immensely grateful
if you didn't clean up just now.

630
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,800
Just a few things.
But playboys, us!

631
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,600
That's really funny.
I think they actually envy us.

632
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,800
- They should only know.
- Leave everything alone.

633
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,200
I'm not through dirtying up for the night.

634
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,800
- Don't you see the irony of it?
- Yes, I see it.

635
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,900
- I don't think you see it.
- I'm telling you. I see the irony of it.

636
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,300
All right, tell me. What's the irony?

637
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:11,800
Unless we come to some arrangement,
I'm gonna kill you. That's the irony of it.

638
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,800
- What's wrong, Oscar?
- This system is wrong.

639
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,400
I don't think two single men
living in a big apartment

640
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,600
should have a cleaner
house than my mother!

641
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,000
What are you talking about?
You don't have to clean up.

642
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,100
What you do is worse.
You're always hanging up my towels.

643
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,500
When I smoke,
you follow me with an ashtray.

644
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:37,700
Last night I found you washing
the kitchen floor, moaning, '"Footprints.'"

645
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,200
- I didn't say they were yours.
- They were mine.

646
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,100
What do you want me to do?
Climb across the cabinets?

647
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:49,000
- I just want you to walk on the floor.
- I really appreciate that.

648
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,400
I'm just trying
to keep this place liveable.

649
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,500
- I didn't know I irritated you that much.
- Leave my pictures alone.

650
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,200
- I was just trying to even them up.
- I want them uneven. They're mine.

651
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,600
Even up your own pictures.

652
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,600
I was wondering how long it would take.

653
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,800
- How long what would take?
- Before I got on your nerves.

654
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,300
I didn't say you got on my nerves.
Don't do that.

655
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,800
Same thing. You said I irritated you.

656
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,100
You said you irritated me.
I didn't say it.

657
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,700
- What did you say?
- What difference does it make?

658
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,700
I was just repeating
what I thought you said.

659
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,100
Don't repeat what you thought I said.
My God! That's irritating.

660
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,900
- You did say it.
- I don't believe this conversation.

661
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,800
Oscar, I'm sorry.

662
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,000
- I don't know what's wrong with me.
- And don't pout.

663
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,300
We'll fight, but don't pout.
Fighting, I win, pouting, you win.

664
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,600
You're right. Everything you say
about me is absolutely right.

665
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,500
Don't give in. I'm not always right.
Sometimes you're right.

666
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,000
You're right.
I always figure I'm wrong.

667
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,800
- Only this time you are wrong.
- Leave me alone.

668
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:00,700
- Don't sulk. That's like pouting.
- I know.

669
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:06,600
Damn me. Why can't I do
just one lousy thing right?

670
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,000
- Why didn't you throw it?
- I almost did.

671
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,300
- Sometimes I get insane.
- Then why not throw the cup?

672
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,500
- I'm trying to control myself.
- Why?

673
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,400
What do you mean, '"why'"?

674
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,700
You were angry.
Why didn't you throw it?

675
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,800
I'd still be angry
and I'd have a broken cup.

676
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,900
How do you know?
Maybe you'd feel wonderful.

677
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,200
Why do you control every thought
that comes into your head?

678
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:37,800
Do something you feel like doing,
not what you're supposed to do.

679
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,900
Stop controlling yourself. Relax.

680
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,900
Get drunk. Get angry.
Break the lousy cup.

681
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,600
I hurt my arm.

682
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,700
You're a hopeless mental case.

683
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,100
I shouldn't throw with that arm.
I got bursitis.

684
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,200
Why don't you live in a closet?

685
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,300
I'll leave your meals outside the door
and slide in the newspapers.

686
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,000
- I hurt easily and I can't help it.
- You're not gonna cry?

687
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,300
Those tears dripping on your arm
is what gave you bursitis.

688
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,400
Let me tell you something.

689
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,600
I may not be the easiest person
to live with,

690
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,900
but you could have done
a whole lot worse.

691
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,800
- How?
- I put order in this house.

692
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:36,500
You're saving money, sleeping
on clean sheets, eating hot meals.

693
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,400
- And I did that!
- Yes, that's right.

694
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:45,200
Then after we've had your halibut steak
and tartare sauce

695
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:50,100
I have to spend the evening
watching you Saran wrap the leftovers.

696
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,300
When are you and I gonna have
some fun and get out?

697
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,100
What are you talking about?
Eat over the plate.

698
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,400
Fun? Getting a clear picture on
Channel Two is not my idea of whoopee.

699
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:06,700
But we don't always watch TV.
Sometimes we read and talk.

700
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,600
I read and you talk.
I try to work and you talk.

701
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,700
I go to sleep and you talk.

702
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,900
Your life's arranged pretty good.
I'm looking for a little entertainment.

703
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,100
Are you saying I talk too much?

704
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,900
I'm not complaining.
You got a lot to say.

705
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,600
What's worrying me
is I'm beginning to listen.

706
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:28,500
- You won't hear another peep out of me.
- You're gonna give me a haircut?

707
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:32,300
I'm gonna cut some greens
and make coleslaw for tomorrow.

708
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,500
I don't want coleslaw.
I just want some fun tonight.

709
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,900
- I thought you liked my coleslaw.
- I love your coleslaw.

710
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,100
I'll take your coleslaw to work.
But not tonight. Let's go out.

711
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,800
Let's go. It's only for you.
I don't like coleslaw.

712
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,600
If you wanted to get out
why didn't you say?

713
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:54,200
You think I like slaving
in the kitchen all day long?

714
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,700
Hey, how about that?
Oscar, you're right.

715
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,700
A person has to get out of the house
once in a while.

716
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,800
Yeah, bowling is a wonderful exercise.

717
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:14,100
But that's not the kind
of relaxation I had in mind.

718
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,300
- The night was made for other things.
- Like what?

719
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:22,100
Like unless I touch something soft
in the next two weeks, I'm in trouble.

720
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,800
Oh - you mean women?

721
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,600
If you want to give it a name, women.

722
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,200
It's funny. I haven't thought
of women in weeks.

723
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,500
I fail to see the humour.

724
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,100
All I'm saying is
why don't we spend one night

725
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,100
talking to someone
with higher voices than us?

726
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,900
- You mean...
- That's what I mean.

727
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,200
- I can't.
- Why not?

728
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:50,700
I'm not ready for it yet.
I don't want to discuss it. Let's bowl.

729
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,200
I intend to go out.
I get as lonely as the next fella.

730
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,800
But I've only been separated
two weeks. Give me time.

731
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,600
There is no time left.
I saw a TV guide.

732
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,700
There's nothing on this week -
12 in the corner.

733
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,100
What am I asking, for crying out loud?

734
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:15,100
All I want is dinner and some laughs
with a couple of girls.

735
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,000
Can't you go yourself?
Why do you need me?

736
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,200
I may want to come back

737
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,800
and if we find you washing windows,
it puts a damper on things.

738
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,800
I'll take a pill and go to sleep.

739
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:28,500
Why take a pill when you take a girl?

740
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,700
I would feel guilty.
I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel.

741
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,100
Go ahead and shoot.

742
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,400
And anyway,
I don't know any single girls.

743
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,600
Leave that to me. There are two
English sisters in our building.

744
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,800
One's a widow, the other's a divorcee.
They're a barrel of laughs.

745
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,800
- How do you know?
- I was trapped in the elevator with them.

746
00:58:56,100 --> 00:59:01,000
- Please, say yes.
- If it means that much to you.

747
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,700
That's the Felix I've been waiting for.

748
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,600
- What do they look like?
- Yours is very pretty.

749
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,300
We're set. 7:30 tomorrow.

750
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,600
- Which one do I get?
- The divorcee.

751
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,500
- Why do I get the divorcee?
- You want the widow?

752
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,700
I don't want the widow or the divorcee.
I'm doing this for you.

753
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,700
Take whoever you want.
Just point to the sister of your choice.

754
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,600
I just want some laughs.

755
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,800
What are they?
Old? You know, how?

756
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,600
- 30, 35? Older?
- They're young kids.

757
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,700
Where did you say you met them?
Did they want to meet me?

758
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:43,300
Don't suddenly call one of them Frances!
It's Gwendolyn and Cecily.

759
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:47,400
Not Frances.
Gwendolyn and Cecily.

760
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:55,000
Rule Britannia,
Britannia rule the waves...

761
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,800
Supposing my kids see me?

762
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,400
I'm going to nightclubs with foreign girls.

763
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,900
I got two American kids to support.

764
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,300
Where are we gonna have dinner?

765
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,000
Anywhere you say. Chinese, ltalian...

766
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,000
You mean a restaurant?
It will cost a fortune.

767
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:21,300
We cut down on laundry.
We don't wear socks on Thursdays.

768
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,600
We can't afford restaurants.
I'll cook and we'll save 30 or 40 dollars.

769
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,600
What kind of double date is that?
You'll be in the kitchen all night.

770
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,700
I put it up in the afternoon.

771
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,700
Once my potatoes are in,
I got all the time in the world.

772
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,700
What happened to the new Felix?
Who are you calling?

773
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,400
Frances.
I want her recipe for meatloaf.

774
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,300
The girls will be crazy about it.

775
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:05,100
- I'd like fresh ground.
- That's fresh.

776
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,100
That's packaged.
I want fresh.

777
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,100
- How much?
- Four pounds exactly.

778
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,800
Is that one ripe?

779
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,300
Not for tonight. A couple of days.

780
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:35,600
Hey! Beautiful!
Beautiful!

781
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,100
I'm home, dear!

782
01:01:55,700 --> 01:02:00,100
Something wonderful
is going on in that kitchen.

783
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,200
No doubt about it,
I am the luckiest man on earth.

784
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,100
Felix, listen, I got the wine.

785
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,500
Batard Montrachet, six and a quarter.

786
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,300
You don't mind, pussycat?
We can walk to work this week.

787
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,100
You did a great job.

788
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:18,600
One suggestion.
Let's come down a little with the lights

789
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,500
and up very softly with the music.

790
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:25,700
Hey, you think Mozart goes good
with meatloaf?

791
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:34,300
What's the matter? Something's wrong.
I can tell from your conversation.

792
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:38,400
- All right, Felix, what is it?
- What is it?

793
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,900
- Let's start with what time you think it is.
- What time? I don't know. 7:30?

794
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,800
- Try 8:00.
- All right. So it's 8:00. So?

795
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,200
You said you'd be home at 7:00.

796
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,400
- Is that what I said?
- '"I'll be home at 7:00.'"

797
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,900
So I said I'd be home at 7:00
and it's 8:00. What's the problem?

798
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,800
If you knew you'd be late,
why didn't you call?

799
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,700
- I couldn't, I was busy.
- Too busy to phone? Where were you?

800
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,500
- In the office, working.
- In the office, working?

801
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,200
I called at 7:00.
You were gone.

802
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,100
I couldn't get a cab home.

803
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:18,100
Since when do they have cabs
in Hannigan's Bar?

804
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,600
Wait. I want this on a tape recorder.
Nobody's gonna believe me.

805
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Now I've got to call you
if I'm coming home late for dinner?

806
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,600
Not any dinner.

807
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:31,000
Just the ones I've been slaving over
since 5:00 this afternoon

808
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,900
to help you save
to pay your wife's alimony.

809
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,500
Felix, this is no time
to have a domestic quarrel.

810
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,400
We got two girls coming down
here any minute!

811
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,200
You told them to be here at 8:00?

812
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,800
I don't remember what I said -
7:30, 8:00. What's the difference?

813
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:52,100
I'll tell you.
You said they'd be here at 7:30.

814
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,500
You were gonna be here at 7:00,
help me with the hors d'oeuvres

815
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,200
and at 7:30 they get here,
we have cocktails.

816
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:03,100
At 8:00 we're gonna eat dinner.
It's now 8:00 and the meatloaf is done.

817
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:07,200
If we don't eat within 15 seconds,
the damned thing will be dried out.

818
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,200
God help me.

819
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,100
Never mind you.
Tell him to save my meatloaf.

820
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:19,500
- Can't you keep it warm?
- You think I'm the magic chef?

821
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,800
I'm lucky I got it
to come out at 8:00.

822
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:26,300
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know. Pour gravy on it.

823
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:30,000
- Don't you have any gravy?
- Where do I get gravy at 8:00?

824
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,400
I thought it comes
when you cook the meat.

825
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:38,000
You don't know what you're talking about.
You just don't know.

826
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,500
You got to make gravy.
It doesn't come.

827
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,900
- You asked my advice...
- Your advice?

828
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,200
You didn't even know
where this kitchen was till I showed you.

829
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,400
You want to talk, buddy?
Put down that spoon.

830
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:52,400
You dumb ignoramus,
that is a ladle!

831
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:56,400
- You did not know that's a ladle.
- Get a hold of yourself.

832
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,700
You think it's so easy?
The kitchen's all yours.

833
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:03,800
You make a meatloaf for four people
that come a half hour late!

834
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,900
I'm arguing with him over gravy.

835
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,300
They're here.
I'll get a saw and cut the meat.

836
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,800
I want to tell you something.

837
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,300
I'm not taking the blame for this dinner.

838
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,700
- Who even cares about the dinner?
- I care.

839
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:21,500
I take pride in what I do
and you're gonna explain what happened.

840
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,500
You can take a picture of me
coming in at 8:00.

841
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,700
Take off that stupid apron.
I'm opening the door.

842
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,300
This is the last time I cook for you.

843
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,700
You don't even appreciate a decent meal.

844
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,700
- That's why they have TV dinners.
- Are you through?

845
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,600
Then smile.

846
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,400
- Hi there.
- Hello.

847
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:48,100
- I hope we're not late.
- You timed it perfectly. Come in.

848
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:53,000
- Oh, isn't this lovely?
- Thank you very much.

849
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,300
Felix, I'd like you to meet two elevator
acquaintances of mine.

850
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:03,600
- Gwendolyn and Cecily.
- No, Cecily and Gwendolyn.

851
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,800
Terribly sorry.
Cecily and Gwendolyn.

852
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:08,700
- Don't tell me, Robin?
- No.

853
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,300
- Cardinal?
- Wrong both times. It's Pigeon.

854
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:16,800
Cecily and Gwendolyn Pigeon.
The Pigeon sisters.

855
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:21,800
Or as our friends in Chelsea used to
call us, the Coo-Coo Pigeon sisters.

856
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,900
- I like that.
- Thank you.

857
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:32,000
Girls, I'd like you to meet my roommate
and our chef, Mr Felix Ungar.

858
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:35,100
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

859
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,900
Well, we did that beautifully.

860
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:45,000
Shall we sit down
and make ourselves comfortable?

861
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,300
This is so nice.

862
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,300
Perfume.

863
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,100
Shall I sit here?

864
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,600
Sure, any place you like.

865
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,300
Don't sit on the hors d'oeuvre!

866
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,300
This is ever so nice, isn't it Gwen?

867
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:15,200
And it's so much neater than our flat.
Do you have help?

868
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,700
Yes, I have a man
who comes in every night.

869
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,800
Well, aren't you the lucky one?

870
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,900
This is really nice.

871
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,100
I was telling Felix
only yesterday how we met.

872
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,900
- Who's Felix?
- He is.

873
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:42,600
Oh, yes, of course. Sorry.

874
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,500
You know, it happened to us
again this morning?

875
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:49,200
- Stuck in the lift again.
- Just the two of you?

876
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,400
And Mr Kessler from the third floor
for nearly half an hour.

877
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,600
Is that right? What happened?

878
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,300
Nothing much, I'm afraid.

879
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,200
Oh, honestly! Gwen!

880
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,800
This is really nice.

881
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,300
And ever so much cooler
than our place.

882
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,700
It's like Equatorial Africa
on our side of the building.

883
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:29,000
Last night it was so bad,
Gwen and I sat there in nature's own

884
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,200
cooling ourselves in front of the fridge.

885
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:35,400
- Can you imagine such a thing?
- I'm working on it.

886
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,400
Honestly!

887
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:43,400
It's impossible to get a night's sleep.
Cec and I don't know what to do.

888
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,300
Why don't you sleep
with an air-conditioner?

889
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,700
- We haven't got one.
- I know, but we have.

890
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:53,300
I told you about that one, didn't I?

891
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,900
They say it may rain, Friday.

892
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,300
That should cool things off a bit.

893
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,100
Yes, I wouldn't be surprised.

894
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:27,300
Although sometimes it gets hotter
after it rains.

895
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:32,000
- Yes it does, doesn't it?
- Yes, sometimes it gets hotter.

896
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,000
- Dinner's served.
- No, it isn't!

897
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:41,600
I'm sure the girls would like
a cocktail first, wouldn't you?

898
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,800
- I wouldn't put up a struggle.
- What would you like?

899
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,600
I don't know. What have you got?

900
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,400
- Meatloaf.
- Oh.

901
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,900
She means to drink.
We have everything.

902
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,500
And what we don't have,
I mix in the medicine cabinet.

903
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:01,400
- What'll it be?
- Oh, a double vodka.

904
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,800
Darling, please not before dinner.

905
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:08,100
My sister, honestly.
She watches over me like a mother hen!

906
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,500
Make it a small double vodka.

907
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,700
A small double vodka.
And for the beautiful mother hen?

908
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:21,000
Well, I think I'd like something cool.

909
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:26,900
I know. I would like a double Drambuie
with crushed ice.

910
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:30,000
Unless you haven't got crushed ice.

911
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:35,000
I was up all night with a sledgehammer.
I shall return.

912
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,700
- Where are you going?
- To get the refreshments.

913
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:44,300
- Inside? What am I gonna do?
- You can finish the weather report.

914
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:47,000
Don't forget to look at my meatloaf.

915
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:29,700
- Oscar tells me you're sisters.
- Yes. That's right.

916
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:32,100
From England.

917
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,200
I see. We're not brothers.

918
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,500
Yes. We know.

919
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:46,100
Although I am a brother.
I have a brother.

920
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,400
He's a doctor in Buffalo.
That's up state New York.

921
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,400
- Yes, we know.
- You know my brother?

922
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,800
No. We know Buffalo
is up state in New York.

923
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,700
Yes, thank you.

924
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
We've been there. Have you?

925
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,200
- No. Is it nice?
- It's lovely.

926
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,300
Isn't that interesting?

927
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:10,600
Silly me. Thank you.

928
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:29,000
How long have you two been
in the United States of America?

929
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,300
- Four? Four in June.
- Almost four years now.

930
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,400
- Just visiting?
- No. We live here.

931
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,800
- Do you work here too?
- Oh yes.

932
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,700
Yes, we're secretaries for a health club.

933
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,100
People bring us their bodies
and we do wonderful things with them.

934
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,000
If you're interested,

935
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:53,100
Off the price, not off your body.

936
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,600
Oscar, where are the drinks?

937
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,600
And what field of endeavour
are you engaged in?

938
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,500
- I write the news for television.
- Oh, fascinating.

939
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,600
Where do you get your ideas from?

940
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,900
From...

941
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,300
...the news.

942
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,700
Oh yes, of course. Silly me.

943
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,800
Maybe you can mention
Gwen and I in one of your reports.

944
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,900
If you do something spectacular,
then maybe I will.

945
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,900
We've done spectacular things

946
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:43,000
but I don't think we want it
all over the telly!

947
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,600
Oscar!

948
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:54,600
This apartment is so big,
sometimes you have to holler.

949
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,350
Oh.

950
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,800
Just you two baches live here?

951
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:03,400
Baches? Oh, you mean bachelors.

952
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,700
We're not bachelors.
We're divorced.

953
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,900
That is Oscar's divorced
and I'm getting...

954
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:15,500
Small world. We've cut the dinghy
loose too, as they say.

955
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:19,000
You couldn't have a better matched
foursome, could you?

956
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,100
No, I suppose not.

957
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:24,100
Although, technically I am a widow.

958
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,600
I was divorcing my husband

959
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:30,200
but he died before the final papers
came through.

960
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,400
I'm awfully sorry.
Divorce is a terrible thing, isn't it?

961
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,000
It can be if you haven't got
the right solicitor.

962
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,200
That's true.
Sometimes it can drag out for months.

963
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,700
I was lucky. Snip, cut and I was free.

964
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,900
But of course, that's all water
under the bridge now, isn't it?

965
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:57,000
I'm terribly sorry,
I think I've forgotten your name.

966
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,200
- Felix.
- Of course, Felix.

967
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,900
- Like the cat.
- The cat.

968
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:07,000
Well, the Pigeons will have to beware
of the cat, won't they?

969
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:14,000
That's the worst part about breaking up.

970
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,900
Childhood sweethearts, were you?

971
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:22,700
No, that's my little boy and girl.
He's seven. She's five.

972
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,400
Oh, sweet.

973
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,700
They live with their mother.

974
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:29,400
I imagine you must miss them terribly.

975
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:33,900
I can't stand being away from them.
But that's what happens with divorce.

976
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:38,200
- When do you see them?
- Every night. I drop by on the way home.

977
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:42,700
And I take them on weekends
and holidays, July and August.

978
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
- When is that you miss them?
- Whenever I'm not there.

979
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,500
If they didn't have to go
to school so early,

980
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,800
I'd make them breakfast.
They love my French toast.

981
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,100
You certainly are a devoted father.

982
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,900
- It's Frances who's wonderful.
- She's the little girl?

983
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:01,300
- No, she's the mother. My wife.
- The one you're divorcing?

984
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:04,300
She's done a terrific job
bringing them up.

985
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,800
They always look so nice, so polite.

986
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,400
They speak beautifully.
Never '"yeah'", always '"yes'".

987
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:12,800
They're such good kids.
And she's done it all.

988
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:17,400
She's a wonderful woman.
She's the kind of woman who...

989
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,400
What am I talking?
You're not interested in any of this.

990
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,700
Nonsense! You've a right to be proud.

991
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:27,800
You have two beautiful children
and a wonderful ex-wife.

992
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,800
There's Frances, see?

993
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:34,100
Oh, she's pretty.
Isn't she pretty Cecy?

994
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,200
- Oh yes, a pretty girl.
- Yes, she is pretty.

995
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,700
Isn't that nice?

996
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,300
- There's no one in the picture.
- I know. That's our living room.

997
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:47,200
- We had a beautiful apartment.
- It's very pretty.

998
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,100
- Those are lovely lamps.
- Thank you.

999
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,100
We got those in Mexico...
on our honeymoon.

1000
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,800
I used to love to come home at night.

1001
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:01,700
That was my whole life.
My wife and kids and my apartment.

1002
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,900
Does she have the lamps now, too?

1003
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:21,200
Yes. I gave her everything.
My children and the lamps.

1004
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,400
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get emotional.

1005
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,800
Would you like some potato chips?

1006
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:40,500
Please, please.
You mustn't be ashamed.

1007
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,800
It's a rare quality in a man
to be able to cry.

1008
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:50,400
So do I. I think it's sweet.
Terribly, terribly sweet.

1009
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,100
You're just making it worse.

1010
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:58,100
It's so refreshing to hear a man speak
so highly of the woman he's divorcing.

1011
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:04,900
Oh dear. Now you've got me thinking
about poor Sydney.

1012
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,900
Gwen, please don't.

1013
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:10,300
It was a good marriage
at first, wasn't it?

1014
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:15,400
Everybody said so, didn't they?
Not like you and George.

1015
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:19,500
No, that's right.
George and I were never happy.

1016
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:23,400
Not for one single, solitary day.

1017
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,500
- This is ridiculous.
- I don't know what brought this on.

1018
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,100
I was feeling so good a few minutes ago.

1019
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:34,100
I haven't cried since I was 14.

1020
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,800
Is everybody happy?

1021
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,200
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1022
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:53,900
Nothing? I'm gone three minutes
and I walk into a funeral parlour.

1023
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:57,300
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.

1024
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,700
I can't leave you alone for five seconds.

1025
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,800
If you really want to cry,
look at your meatloaf.

1026
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,900
Why didn't you call me?

1027
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,400
Girls, I'm terribly sorry.
I forgot to warn you about Felix.

1028
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,400
He's a walking soap opera.

1029
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:18,500
I think he's the dearest thing
I've ever met.

1030
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,100
He's so sensitive, so fragile.

1031
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:28,100
I just want to bundle him up in my arms
and take care of him.

1032
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,900
I think when he comes out of that
kitchen, you may have to.

1033
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,500
I'm gonna get some corned beef
sandwiches.

1034
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:48,900
No, wait, Felix.
Maybe we can salvage it.

1035
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:53,500
- Yeah, let's see it.
- See what, $ 4.80 worth of ashes?

1036
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:57,500
I'd throw it down the incinerator
but it won't burn twice.

1037
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:04,600
I've got a wonderful idea.
Why don't we eat at our place?

1038
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,300
- That's a wonderful idea!
- You'd be taking pot luck.

1039
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:12,100
- I'm crazy about pot luck!
- It's awfully hot up there.

1040
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,400
We can open the refrigerator.

1041
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,800
Give us five minutes
to get into our cooking things.

1042
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,100
Can't you make it four?
I'm starving.

1043
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:23,100
- Don't forget the wine.
- How could I forget the wine?

1044
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,400
- And a corkscrew.
- And Felix.

1045
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,600
I won't forget Felix. Ta ta.

1046
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:31,100
- Ta ta.
- Ta ta.

1047
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:35,500
You bet your sweet little crumpets. Ta ta.

1048
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,100
Felix, baby, I love ya.

1049
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,200
You just overcooked us
into one hell of a night.

1050
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,500
Get the ice bucket.
I got the wine.

1051
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,800
I'm not going.

1052
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,500
I said I'm not going.

1053
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,000
Are you out of your mind?
Do you know what's waiting for us?

1054
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,200
You've been invited to spend
the evening in a two bedroom hothouse

1055
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:01,700
with the Coo-Coo Pigeon sisters.
What do you mean, '"you're not going'"?

1056
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,500
I've nothing left to say.
I already told them about my brother.

1057
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,900
I've used up all my conversation.

1058
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:12,600
They're crazy about you.
They're nuts about you. They told me.

1059
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,700
One of them
wants to wrap you up into a bundle.

1060
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
You're doing better than I am.
Come on, get the ice bucket.

1061
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,700
Don't you understand?
I cried in front of two women.

1062
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:25,800
And they loved it. I'm thinking
of getting hysterical. Come on.

1063
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:29,200
I'm still emotionally tied
to Frances and the kids.

1064
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,700
I don't want to talk about it any more.

1065
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I'm gonna scrub the pots
and wash my hair.

1066
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,100
Your pots and your hair can wait.
You're coming with me.

1067
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,000
I'm not going.

1068
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:45,100
What am I going to do up there
with two girls?

1069
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:49,000
If I miss this opportunity,
I'll never forgive you.

1070
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
You're not gonna
make any effort to change?

1071
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:58,200
This is the person
you're gonna be till you die?

1072
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:03,000
We are what we are.

1073
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,500
It's 12 floors not 11 .

1074
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:36,950
Ah!

1075
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,600
Hello, sports fans.

1076
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,800
Speculation is running high
among Yankee followers

1077
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:02,500
as to the possibility of trading away
the great Hank Moonjean

1078
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:06,800
for three unknown players
and an undetermined amount of cash.

1079
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:11,000
Moonjean has racked up ten wins
against only three losses this year

1080
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,600
which is, incidentally,
high for both leagues.

1081
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:19,000
It looks like the Yankee office
will be bombarded by many protests...

1082
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:08,000
How long is this gonna go on?

1083
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:11,300
You talking to me?
What do you want to know?

1084
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:16,100
If you gonna spend the rest of your life
not talking to me, I'll get a radio.

1085
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:22,600
You had your chance to talk last night.
I begged you to come.

1086
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,900
Here's a key to the back door.

1087
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:28,800
You stick to the hallway and your room
and you won't get hurt.

1088
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,500
Meaning what?

1089
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:35,200
If you want to live here, I don't want
to see you or smell your cooking.

1090
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:39,200
Now, kindly remove that spaghetti
from my poker table.

1091
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:48,000
- What's so funny?
- It's not spaghetti. It's linguini!

1092
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,100
Now it's garbage.

1093
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:16,400
You're crazy. I'm a neurotic nut
but you're crazy.

1094
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:20,100
That's really funny,
coming from a fruitcake like you.

1095
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:24,000
- I'm not cleaning that up.
- Is that a promise?

1096
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:28,000
Did you hear what I said?
I'm not cleaning your mess.

1097
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,800
Look at it.
It's hanging all over the wall.

1098
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,000
I like it.

1099
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:41,400
You'd just let it hang there,
wouldn't you?

1100
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:46,700
Till it got all hard and brown
and...disgusting.

1101
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,600
- I'm cleaning it.
- Leave that alone.

1102
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:55,600
Touch one strand
and I'll punch you right in the sinuses!

1103
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,600
Oscar, come on, now!

1104
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:01,200
Why don't you take a tranquilliser?

1105
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,200
Go to your room.
Do you hear?

1106
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,200
Let's just settle down.

1107
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,400
I'm warning you, Felix.
You want to live through this night,

1108
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:16,800
you better keep this door locked
and your windows too!

1109
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:52,500
All right, Oscar.
I'd like to know what's happened.

1110
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:57,300
Something made you go off
the deep end. What is it?

1111
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,000
- Is it something I said or did?
- Nothing you said, don't start me.

1112
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:06,000
Oscar, what is it?
Is it the cooking? Or the cleaning?

1113
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,500
I'll tell you. It's the cooking,
cleaning, crying...

1114
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,900
It's the talking in your sleep.

1115
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:16,100
It's those moose calls that open your
ears at two o'clock in the morning.

1116
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,700
I can't take it anymore, Felix.
I'm cracking up.

1117
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,200
Everything you do irritates me.

1118
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:29,400
When you're not here, the things
I know you're gonna do irritate me.

1119
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:32,000
You leave me little notes on my pillow.

1120
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:36,800
I told you 158 times,
I can't stand little notes on my pillow.

1121
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,700
'"We are all out of cornflakes, FU.'"

1122
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
It took me three hours to figure out
that FU was Felix Ungar.

1123
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,300
It's not your fault, Felix.
It's a rotten combination, that's all.

1124
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,300
I get the picture.

1125
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:02,200
I haven't even painted a picture yet.

1126
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:06,000
I got a typewritten list in my office

1127
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:09,700
of the ten most aggravating things
you do that drive me berserk.

1128
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:12,000
But last night was the topper.

1129
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Oh, brother, that was the topper,
the ever loving Lulu of all times!

1130
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:22,300
I had it all set up with those
English sisters and I wind up drinking tea,

1131
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:26,900
- and telling them your life story.
- I warned you not to make that date.

1132
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:30,600
Don't point that finger,
unless you intend to use it.

1133
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,900
- Get off my back.
- What's this? A display of temper?

1134
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:38,500
I haven't seen you really angry since
I dropped my cigar in your pancake batter.

1135
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:42,800
You're asking to hear something
I don't wanna say, but you ought to hear it.

1136
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:46,900
If you've got anything on your chest
besides your chin, get it off.

1137
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,300
All right then, you asked for it!

1138
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,400
You're a wonderful guy, Oscar!
You've done everything for me!

1139
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:56,700
If it weren't for you, I don't know
what would have happened to me.

1140
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:00,200
You gave me a place to live,
something to live for.

1141
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:05,300
I'm never gonna forget you for that.
You're tops with me!

1142
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:13,100
Have I just been told off?
I think I may have missed it.

1143
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,300
It's coming.

1144
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:18,300
You are also
one of the biggest slobs in the world.

1145
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:20,700
- Totally unreliable.
- Is that it?

1146
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:23,700
- Undependable.
- Finished? Keep going, you're hot.

1147
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:29,200
No, not keep going. You've been
told off. How do you like that?

1148
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:32,800
Because now,
I'm gonna tell you off.

1149
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:38,800
For six months I've lived alone in this
apartment in eight big rooms.

1150
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:43,000
I was dejected, despondent
and disgusted. Then you moved in.

1151
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:46,000
My closest and dearest friend.

1152
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:49,400
And after three weeks
of close personal contact,

1153
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:52,300
I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.

1154
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:55,500
Do me a favour.
Move into the kitchen.

1155
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,000
Live with your pots, pans, ladles,
your meat thermometers.

1156
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:04,300
When you want to come out,
ring a bell and I'll run into the bedroom.

1157
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:10,200
I'm asking you nicely, Felix,
as a friend, stay out of my way.

1158
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:16,200
Walk on the paper.
I washed the floor in there.

1159
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,600
Stay away from me, Oscar.

1160
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:30,700
Oscar stay away from me.

1161
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:34,900
This is the day I'm gonna kill you.

1162
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,200
Oscar. No, Oscar!

1163
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:50,000
You hit me,
you get yourself one sweet lawsuit!

1164
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:52,700
Those dogs should be on a leash.

1165
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:00,800
- Can I speak to you calmly?
- First you bleed, then we'll talk.

1166
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:06,900
I got you now, Felix.
There's no place for you to go but down.

1167
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,600
If you want to fight,
let's go to the living room.

1168
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:14,100
I don't want you in my living room,
bedroom, bathroom, kitchen,

1169
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,200
or my building.
I don't want you at all.

1170
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:20,800
- What are you talking about?
- It's over. We're getting an annulment.

1171
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:24,000
Don't you understand?
I don't want to live with you.

1172
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,400
Pack your things,
tie it in Saran wrap and get out.

1173
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:31,200
- You mean actually move out?
- Actually, physically, immediately.

1174
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,500
- This minute?
- Yes, this minute.

1175
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:36,600
If you can do it sooner, I'd appreciate it.

1176
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,800
I've got a good mind to really leave.

1177
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:50,700
Why doesn't he hear me?
I know I'm talking. I recognise my voice.

1178
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:54,100
Because, if you really
want me to go, I'll go.

1179
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:58,000
I want you to go, so go!
When are you going?

1180
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,800
Boy, you're in a bigger hurry
than Frances was.

1181
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:06,000
Take as much time as she gave you.
Follow your usual routine.

1182
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,300
In other words,
you're throwing me out?

1183
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:11,400
Not in other words.
Those are the perfect ones.

1184
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:16,400
I just wanted to get the record straight.
Let it be on your conscience.

1185
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,000
Let what be on my conscience?

1186
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:23,200
I'm perfectly willing to clear the air
of our differences, but you refuse.

1187
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:27,100
I'm sick and tired of you clearing the air.
That's why I want you to leave.

1188
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:31,900
But what happens to me is your
responsibility. Let it be on your head.

1189
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:35,000
Let what be on my head?
Wait a minute.

1190
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:38,200
Why can't you get thrown out
like a decent human being?

1191
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,400
Let what be on my head?

1192
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:56,600
I'm leaving now,
according to your wishes and desires.

1193
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,900
Either I'll come back and get the rest
of my clothes or someone else will.

1194
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,500
You are not going any place

1195
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,600
- until you take it back.
- Take what back?

1196
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,900
'"Let it be on your head.'"
What the hell is that?

1197
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:17,100
- '"The Curse Of The Cat People?'"
- I can't leave if you block the door.

1198
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:21,500
Is this how you left Frances? No wonder
she wanted your room repainted.

1199
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:24,400
I'm gonna have yours dipped in bronze.

1200
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:27,200
Would you get out of the way, please?

1201
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:54,200
Where will you go?

1202
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:58,100
Oh come on, Oscar.

1203
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:00,700
You're not really interested, are you?

1204
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:08,600
All right, you win.
We'll try to iron it out. Come back.

1205
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:10,600
Felix!

1206
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:14,500
Felix, come back!
Don't leave me like this.

1207
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,400
I'm telling you, I'm worried. I know
Felix is going to try something crazy.

1208
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,500
You threw him out?

1209
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:25,700
I threw him out. I admit it.
Let it be on my head.

1210
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:29,100
- Let what be on your head?
- Felix put it there, ask him.

1211
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:30,800
He's out there somewhere.

1212
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:33,000
He was driving us crazy
with his napkins and his ashtrays

1213
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:35,900
and his bacon, lettuce and tomato
sandwiches. All of you said so.

1214
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,500
We didn't say kick him out.

1215
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:41,300
Who do you think I did it for?
I did it for us.

1216
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:46,500
Do you know what he was planning for
Friday's game as a change of pace?

1217
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:51,100
A Hawaiian luau!
Roast pork, fried rice, spareribs.

1218
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,400
They don't play poker
like that in Honolulu.

1219
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:56,200
- He's out there alone.
- Now I'm really worried.

1220
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:59,300
Then why don't we stop worrying
and start looking?

1221
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,200
How are we gonna find him?
It's a big city.

1222
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:05,700
We'll look for a guy
with a suitcase who's crying.

1223
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:20,800
They're not gonna like this
at the station.

1224
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:23,700
You're not supposed to look for
a missing person with a missing car.

1225
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:27,900
Take it out of my taxes.
We'll try his apartment first.

1226
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:40,000
Frances hasn't heard from him
since he called for her meatloaf recipe.

1227
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:43,200
- Where to now?
- Cruise along Riverside Drive.

1228
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:46,400
This is crazy, Oscar.
Why don't we call the cops?

1229
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,400
Drive the car.

1230
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:59,100
What are you doing, Murray?

1231
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:02,600
Off duty arrest.
Caught them gambling.

1232
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,300
We already combed the West Side.

1233
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,300
Why don't we go back
and wait to hear something?

1234
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,400
I'm afraid we'll hear something.

1235
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:21,100
- The poor guy.
- Will you stop saying that.

1236
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,900
What about me?
I got this lousy curse on my head.

1237
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,100
Let's go back. He'll show up.

1238
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:28,500
I know him.
He'll kill himself just to spite me.

1239
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:32,000
Then his ghost will come back,
following me haunting and cleaning.

1240
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:39,700
Come on, Oscar, play a few hands.
It'll take your mind off Felix.

1241
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:42,600
Then stop mentioning his name.

1242
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:45,800
I know what you're all thinking
but you're wrong.

1243
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:47,800
It's his fault, not mine.

1244
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:50,100
He never should have moved in here.

1245
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:52,300
He should have stayed with Blanche.

1246
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:54,700
- Why should he?
- She's his wife.

1247
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,300
Blanche is your wife.
His wife is Frances.

1248
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:01,500
Are you some kind of wise guy?
The game is over. Give me my cards.

1249
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:04,500
- I don't want to play any more.
- We didn't even start.

1250
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:07,700
I'm not gonna worry.
He's not worrying about me.

1251
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,000
He's out in the streets,
sulking and having a wonderful time.

1252
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:15,000
- I smell spaghetti.
- It's not spaghetti, it's linguini.

1253
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,700
- Don't you care?
- I thought you weren't worried.

1254
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,500
I'm not, dammit. I'm not worried.

1255
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:23,600
- I'll bet that's him.
- I said he'd be back.

1256
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Vinnie, open the door.
Play like nothing happened. Just deal.

1257
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,300
OK, open the door.

1258
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:37,400
- Hello.
- How do you do?

1259
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,600
Hello there, Cecily.

1260
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:44,200
Gwendolyn. Please, don't stand up.
May I see you a moment, Mr Madison?

1261
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:49,100
Certainly, Gwendolyn.
What's the matter?

1262
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:55,400
I think you know.
I've come for Felix's things.

1263
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:07,000
- You mean my Felix?
- Yes, Felix Ungar.

1264
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:12,400
That sweet man who's in my flat
pouring his heart out to my sister.

1265
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,100
Gwen, Felix doesn't want to stay.
Please tell him to stay.

1266
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:21,300
Please, this is embarrassing.
I can go to a hotel.

1267
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:25,100
- There's plenty of room on the sofa.
- I'll be in the way.

1268
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,900
How could you possibly
be in anyone's way?

1269
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:31,200
- You want to see a typewritten list?
- You've said enough.

1270
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:35,300
- Please just for a few days.
- Until you get settled.

1271
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:40,600
- Please, we'd be so happy.
- Maybe just for a few days.

1272
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,900
- That's marvellous!
- Get the rest of your things.

1273
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:46,300
- We'll clean the house.
- And cook dinner.

1274
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,700
It'll be so nice to have a man
about the house again.

1275
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Good night, gentlemen.
Sorry to interrupt your bridge game.

1276
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,100
- Ta ta.
- Ta ta.

1277
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:18,400
What did I tell you?
It's always the quiet guys.

1278
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,900
What nice girls.

1279
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:31,200
Felix, are you really gonna move
in with them?

1280
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:34,200
Just for a couple of days
until I get my own pad.

1281
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:37,600
- Aren't you going to thank me?
- For what?

1282
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:42,200
The two greatest things I've done for you.
Taking you in and throwing you out.

1283
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:45,900
You're right. Getting thrown
out twice is enough for any man.

1284
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:48,100
In gratitude, I remove the curse.

1285
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:51,200
Bless you and thank you,
Wicked Witch of the North.

1286
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:54,200
Probably the girls.
They hate it when I'm late for cocktails.

1287
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:56,400
It's your wife.

1288
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,400
Do me a favour.
Tell her I can't talk to her right now.

1289
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:06,500
I'll call her in a couple of days
because we have a lot to talk about.

1290
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,400
And if I sound different,

1291
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:12,600
it's because I'm not the same man
she threw out three weeks ago.

1292
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:16,300
I will when I see her.
This is Oscar's wife.

1293
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:22,800
Hello, Blanche.

1294
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:24,600
I got a pretty good idea
why you're calling.

1295
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:27,600
You got my cheques, right?
So now we're even.

1296
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,600
No, I haven't been winning at the track.

1297
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:35,200
I've just been eating home a lot lately.
You don't have to thank me.

1298
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:39,000
I'm just doing what's right.
That's very nice of you too.

1299
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:41,000
Good night, Mr Madison.

1300
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:44,700
If you need any heavy cleaning,
I get a dollar and a half an hour.

1301
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,600
Yeah, OK.

1302
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:51,300
Talk to you tomorrow night.
Kiss the kids for me. Good night, Blanche.

1303
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:55,600
What about next Friday?
You're not gonna break up the game?

1304
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Never. Marriage may come and go,
but the game must go on.

1305
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:01,700
So long, Frances.

1306
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,500
So long, Blanche.

1307
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:11,000
What are we gonna do?
Sit around or play poker?

1308
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:12,900
Let's play.

1309
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:19,700
Boys, let's watch the cigarette butts.
This is my house, not a pig sty.

1310
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:25,000
Ante a quarter, fellas.
