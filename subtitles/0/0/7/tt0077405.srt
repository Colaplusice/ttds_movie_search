1
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:49,767
<i>Keep it goin'!
All right. Shake it out. Keep movin'.</i>

2
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,671
You're late.

3
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:00,102
<i>Hey, you.</i>

4
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,649
Shake it out!

5
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,996
<i>- Hey.
- You talkin' to me?</i>

6
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,510
<i>Here!</i>

7
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:51,122
<i>Me and my brother-
It just used to be me and my brother.</i>

8
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,324
<i>We used to do things together.</i>

9
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,401
<i>We used to have fun.</i>

10
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,839
<i>We used to roam the streets.</i>

11
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,307
<i>There was people sufferin'
of pain and hunger.</i>

12
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,747
<i>Some people, their tongues
were hangin' out of their mouth.</i>

13
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,745
<i>Just gotta get fixed up first.</i>

14
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,362
Things aren't always
gonna be this way.

15
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,800
You know that, don't you?

16
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,895
<i>He used to juggle apples.</i>

17
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,702
<i>He- He used to amuse us.</i>

18
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,777
<i>He used to entertain us.</i>

19
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,944
What else do I get to do today?

20
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,450
<i>In fact, all three of us been goin'places...</i>

21
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,012
<i>Looking for things,
searching for things...</i>

22
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,360
<i>goin' on adventures.</i>

23
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,732
<i>They told everybody
they were brother and sister.</i>

24
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,240
<i>My brother didn't want nobody to know.</i>

25
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,908
<i>You know how people are.</i>

26
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,743
<i>You tell 'em somethin',
they start talkin'.</i>

27
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,402
<i>I met this guy named Ding Dong.</i>

28
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,277
<i>He told me the whole earth
is goin' up in flames.</i>

29
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,682
<i>Flames will come out
of here and there...</i>

30
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,913
<i>and they'll just rise up.</i>

31
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,116
<i>The mountains are gonna go up
in big flames.</i>

32
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,693
<i>The water's gonna rise in flames.</i>

33
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,923
<i>There's gonna be creatures
runnin' every which way...</i>

34
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,332
<i>some of them burned,
half their wings burnin'.</i>

35
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,872
<i>People are gonna be screamin'
and hollerin' for help.</i>

36
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,801
<i>See, the people that have been good,
they're gonna go to heaven...</i>

37
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,845
<i>and escape all that fire.</i>

38
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,438
Sackers! I need sackers!

39
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,382
<i>But if you've
been bad, God don't even hear you.</i>

40
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,114
<i>He don't even hear you talkin'.</i>

41
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,180
A man can earn three dollars a day
if he wants to work.

42
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,784
Sackers! I need sackers!
You ever sack before?

43
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,523
- Sure.
- When was that?

44
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,223
- Last year.
- Get on.

45
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,467
Whose place is that?

46
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:52,060
The owner's. Don't any of you
go up around there either.

47
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,469
- Silver tongue.
- Hey!

48
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,436
- You all right?
- Sure, I am.

49
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,610
- You live around here?
- No, kid.

50
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,614
No, I don't.

51
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,584
- Where do you live?
- In Chicago.

52
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,586
Oh, yeah?

53
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,649
- What's that in your hair?
- In my hair?

54
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,454
- This.
- In my ear?

55
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,529
- Yeah.
- That's what you call a makins.

56
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,155
- What's a makins?
- A cigarette.

57
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,359
- Oh.
- I-It's tobacco in a bag.

58
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,732
- And you put it - roll it up.
- Oh.

59
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:01,204
- But I'm not gonna - I'm gonna save it.
- You like it out here?

60
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,934
- Yeah.
- It's nice.

61
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,636
I lo - I know. I love it out here.
I like the wheat fields and -

62
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:09,909
- You have any brothers or sisters?
- No.

63
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,315
- I have a brother.
- What's his name?

64
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,752
- Bill.
- Where?

65
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,451
He's somewhere - I don't know -
over there. I don't know.

66
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,958
<i>I got one.</i>

67
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,965
Let me see.

68
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,804
Don't lose him. There he goes.
Look, look. Look. Oh, you lost him.

69
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,670
I don't think they like us.

70
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,749
Abby's it!

71
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,319
Abby's too slow.

72
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,854
You didn't get me.
You didn't get me.

73
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:33,091
"For a thousand years in thy sight
are but as yesterday when it is past...

74
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,690
<i>"and as a watch in the night.</i>

75
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,202
<i>As soon as thou scatters
them that are evil"-</i>

76
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,525
Amen.

77
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,529
Amen.

78
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,080
Ho!

79
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,356
<i>Stop straggling. Come on. Come on. Come on.</i>

80
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,765
<i>Get that rake over there.</i>

81
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,768
<i>Come on!</i>

82
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,441
<i>Line 'em up.</i>

83
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,443
<i>Come on!</i>

84
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,800
<i>This farmer,
he didn't know when he first saw her...</i>

85
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,506
<i>or what it was about her
that caught his eye.</i>

86
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,752
<i>Maybe it was the way the wind
blew through her hair.</i>

87
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,254
- What are you smokin' for?
- Why do you wear a black hat?

88
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,294
Let me see your hands.

89
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,665
Why don't you get some spoons,
and I'll meet you over there?

90
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,294
Okay? Over in the field here.

91
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:03,573
Your sister keep you warm
at night, does she?

92
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:07,209
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

93
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,491
Hmm.

94
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,531
Come on!

95
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,073
Let me go!

96
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,042
- Relax.
- Okay!

97
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:55,364
Too bad you ain't got any real food left.
I'm kinda hungry.

98
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,874
I got a little potato here.

99
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,707
You know anything about that woman
out there, the one with the black hair?

100
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,724
You haven't heard anything about her?
Where she's from?

101
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,920
<i>You want me to find out?</i>

102
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,428
You wasted more than 12 bushels
in this row.

103
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,301
I'm docking you three dollars.

104
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,637
Hey, what are you talkin' about?
That's not fair!

105
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,710
<i>Then leave. You're fired.</i>

106
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,814
<i>- Wait a minute.
- Forget it. Don't fight about it.</i>

107
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,509
You want to stay?

108
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,745
Then shut up and get back to work.

109
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,932
They treat you like shit out here.

110
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,004
Don't worry about it.

111
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,941
I seen a doctor comin' by.

112
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,705
I'll see if I can get him
to give you somethin' for that.

113
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,713
Right?

114
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,983
Okay.

115
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,732
Ooh!

116
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,347
<i>Hey!</i>

117
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,322
<i>I appreciate you coming out, Doc.</i>

118
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,391
That's all right.

119
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,228
I'll be checking on you
as time goes on.

120
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,098
You never think it's gonna happen to you.

121
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,134
Yup.

122
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,204
How long would you reckon I have?

123
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,441
<i>You know, you can tell me.</i>

124
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,307
<i>A year. Maybe a year.</i>

125
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,486
<i>He knew he was gonna die.</i>

126
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,026
<i>He knew there was nothin'
that could be done.</i>

127
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,028
Catch it.

128
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,463
Goosey.

129
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,471
<i>You're only on this Earth once.</i>

130
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,064
<i>And I- to my opinion,
as long as you're around...</i>

131
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,076
<i>you should have it nice.</i>

132
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,485
Here we go. Here we go.

133
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:30,041
Excuse me.
I forgot where I was.

134
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,042
Don't worry.

135
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:37,704
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

136
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,620
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

137
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,058
Where do you go from here?

138
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,354
All over.

139
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,691
<i>Wyoming.</i>

140
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,532
You think I'll like it?

141
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,636
- I saved your life today.
- Nah.

142
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,273
Yeah, I killed a shit-eating dog.

143
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,845
Thanks.

144
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,914
I'm always lookin' out for you.

145
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,484
You deserve a medal.

146
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,385
<i>Whoa. Hey.</i>

147
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,255
Are you cold?

148
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,491
It's only for a while.

149
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,965
Then we'll go to New York.

150
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,968
And then what?

151
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,129
Then we're there.
Then we get fixed up.

152
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,609
<i>All right. I want to see everybody working.</i>

153
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,618
<i>Everybody out here,
movin' it along.</i>

154
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,086
<i>Shake it! Come on. Let's go!</i>

155
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,157
<i>Let's go! Go now!</i>

156
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,461
<i>There we go!</i>

157
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:44,400
<i>From the time
the sun went up till it went down...</i>

158
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,977
<i>theys were workin' all the time.</i>

159
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,238
<i>No- Nonstop.</i>

160
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,317
<i>Just keep going.</i>

161
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,614
<i>Up with it. Come on. Let's go!</i>

162
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,919
<i>You didn't work,
they'd ship you right out of there.</i>

163
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,994
<i>All right. Let's go! Shake it out!</i>

164
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,222
<i>They don't need you.</i>

165
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,094
<i>They can always get somebody else.</i>

166
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:56,837
That's at a profit of $4.75 an acre.

167
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,280
Multiply that by 20,000.

168
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,352
You're talkin' over six figures.

169
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,921
- Big year.
- Your biggest ever.

170
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,490
Should make you the richest man
in the panhandle.

171
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,828
You oughta get out
while you're this far ahead.

172
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,057
You have nothing to gain by staying.

173
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,760
Hey, get off of there!

174
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,762
No!

175
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,701
You fall in, I gotta clean up.

176
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,553
<i>This farmer, he had a big spread...</i>

177
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,955
<i>and a lot of money.</i>

178
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,961
<i>Whoever was sittin' in the chair
when he'd come around...</i>

179
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,531
<i>why, they'd stand up
and give it to him.</i>

180
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,970
<i>Wasn't no harm in him.</i>

181
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,063
<i>You'd give him a flower,
he'd keep it forever.</i>

182
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,274
<i>He was headed for the boneyard
any minute...</i>

183
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:41,250
<i>but he wasn't really goin' around
squawkin' about it...</i>

184
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:45,012
<i>like some people.</i>

185
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,853
<i>In one way, I felt sorry for him...</i>

186
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:51,759
<i>'cause he had nobody
to stand out for him...</i>

187
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,661
<i>be by his side...</i>

188
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,462
<i>hold his hand
when he needs attention or somethin'.</i>

189
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,470
<i>That's touchin'.</i>

190
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,808
We'll probably be all done
by tomorrow.

191
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,112
You still plan on goin' north?

192
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,123
Mm-hmm.

193
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,919
The reason I ask is, uh...

194
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,861
maybe you'd like to stay on here.

195
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,729
Well, it'd be easier than it is now.
There's not that much work after the harvest.

196
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,044
Pay's just as good.

197
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:48,418
It's an idea. You could think about it
and let me know later.

198
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,265
I gotta run.

199
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,496
<i>Who's that?</i>

200
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,504
My brother.

201
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,246
He's stuck on ya.

202
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,346
- Hmm. Legs.
- There are people around.

203
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,355
- There's nobody around.
- Yes, there are.

204
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,357
- Look at that.
- Stop it.

205
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,670
He doesn't have any family either.

206
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,244
<i>Why don't you tell him you'll stay?</i>

207
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,982
What for?

208
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,989
I don't know.

209
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,261
Somethin' might happen.

210
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,398
<i>What's your mouth hangin' open for?</i>

211
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:17,707
Don't tell me. I already know.

212
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,573
On account of your unhappy life -
all that shit.

213
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,349
Well, I'm tellin' you,
we gotta do something about it.

214
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,351
Can't expect anybody else to.

215
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,414
<i>Last load! Comin' down!</i>

216
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,186
<i>Hup! Shut her down!</i>

217
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,662
Are we gonna stay?

218
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,366
If she wants to.

219
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,972
You'd rather go?

220
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,611
I'd rather be the king of Siam.

221
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,515
You put aspirin in this?

222
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,450
<i>- Ninety dollars.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

223
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,452
Hey!

224
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,416
<i>- Want a bite?
- Thank you very much, sir.</i>

225
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,427
Eighty-seven dollars.

226
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,156
<i>Did he ever buy you anything?</i>

227
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,598
Lots of things.

228
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,330
<i>He'll come back, I'm sure.</i>

229
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,767
I don't think so.

230
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,809
Why not?

231
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,369
'Cause if he wanted me to be with him,
he would have took me.

232
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,450
Oh, that's not true.

233
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:43,579
<i>I don't know. Maybe I wasn't
pretty enough or somethin'.</i>

234
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,656
<i>Somethin' stupid like that.</i>

235
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,793
What happened to your ear?

236
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:55,994
<i>My dog bit me when I was little.
We were playin'.</i>

237
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,069
Can I have a puff?

238
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,404
<i>He was tired of livin' like
the rest of them-</i>

239
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,537
<i>nosin' around like a pig in a gutter.</i>

240
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,615
<i>He wasn't in the mood no more.</i>

241
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,849
<i>He figured there must be
somethin' wrong with 'em-</i>

242
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,149
<i>the way they always got no luck-</i>

243
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,451
<i>and they oughta get it
straightened out.</i>

244
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,526
<i>He figured some people need
more than they got...</i>

245
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,223
<i>other people got more
than they need.</i>

246
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,766
<i>Just a matter of gettin' us
all together.</i>

247
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,128
<i>Chicago!</i>

248
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,138
Well, go ahead!

249
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,417
Weren't even dancing shoes.
You got on regular shoes.

250
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,516
You never used to be like this.

251
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,321
As long as I can remember, people been giving
me a hard time about one thing or another.

252
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,392
- Don't you start in too.
- Oh.

253
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:31,996
Big federal case.

254
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:38,759
We don't have to decide
anything final now.

255
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,770
Just if we're gonna stay.

256
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:55,780
Hey-yee!

257
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,270
Whoo!

258
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,977
Hey-yee!

259
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:37,193
<i>Yeah, I could stay, sure. I gotta keep
my brother and sister with me though.</i>

260
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,006
<i>- Whoo!
- Yeah!</i>

261
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,571
<i>Hey! Yea!</i>

262
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,499
I'll try and come back.

263
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,928
I'll try and come back 'cause I...
I really liked staying with you.

264
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,407
You were so much fun.
I love you, okay?

265
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,536
I want you to be really good.
And I don't want you to do anything wrong.

266
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:31,513
If you do anything wrong,
I'll come back and I'll get ya. All right?

267
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,084
I love you,
and don't do nothin' wrong!

268
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,085
All right?

269
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:28,097
<i>I've been thinkin' what to do
with my future.</i>

270
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:39,010
<i>I could be a mud doctor...</i>

271
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,585
<i>checkin' out the earth underneath.</i>

272
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,740
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

273
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,715
When I was your age,
I was all by myself in the world.

274
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,158
I used to sit and wrap cigars...

275
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,160
until after dark.

276
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:28,659
My skin was as white as paper.

277
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,734
I never saw the daylight.

278
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,006
This is not so bad.

279
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:43,611
Don't make me laugh.

280
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:46,410
What about this then?

281
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,919
Wait a minute.

282
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,991
- Where are you people from?
- Chicago.

283
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,186
- Yeah? What'd you do there?
- Nothing.

284
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,195
Your brother, I mean.

285
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,765
He worked in a factory.

286
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,600
I can remember
the first time I ever saw you.

287
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,605
Hmm?

288
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,640
Never seen hair as black as yours.

289
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,146
Skin so pretty.

290
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,920
Scared I'd never see you again.

291
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,758
- Run!
- Come on.

292
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,303
<i>Safe!</i>

293
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,978
<i>So, I went to work in the mill.</i>

294
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,052
Couldn't wait to get in there.

295
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,986
Begin at 7:00.
Got to have a smile on your face.

296
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,861
And one day you wake up...

297
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,029
you find you're not
the smartest guy in the world.

298
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,431
Never gonna come up
with the big score.

299
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,640
When I was growin' up,
I thought I really would.

300
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,649
- Where'd you learn that?
- From watching the girls at Baker Hall.

301
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,160
<i>Actually,
I could have been a dancer.</i>

302
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,999
I think I love you.

303
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,538
What a nice thing to say.

304
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,652
Never thought he'd have the guts.

305
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,097
- Who'd know but you and me?
- Nobody.

306
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,330
That's all that matters, isn't it?

307
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,068
You talk like it was all right.

308
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:30,076
He'll never have a chance
to enjoy his money anyway.

309
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,250
What makes you think we're talkin'
about just a couple of months?

310
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,557
The man's got one foot on a banana peel,
the other on a roller skate.

311
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,928
It'll all be gone in a couple of years.

312
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,333
Who's gonna care
that we acted perfect?

313
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,710
I held out a long time.

314
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:03,778
I had rich men
pay me compliments.

315
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,883
Have I ever said anything to you
that would make you think-

316
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,078
You don't have to.

317
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:13,122
I mean, I hate it,
to see you stooped over out there.

318
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:17,154
<i>Them looking at your ass
like you're a whore.</i>

319
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,833
<i>I hate it.</i>

320
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,530
<i>As you will answer
at the dreadful day ofjudgment.</i>

321
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,035
The secrets in all hearts
shall be disclosed.

322
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:02,332
And if either of you know
any impediment -

323
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,670
<i>For richer and for poorer...</i>

324
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,675
for better, for worse...

325
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,211
in sickness and in health...

326
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,508
to love and to cherish...

327
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,583
till death us do part.

328
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,050
<i>Bless, O Lord, this ring
that he who gives it...</i>

329
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,747
<i>and she who wears it
may abide by peace.</i>

330
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,072
<i>Thank you.</i>

331
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,242
Thank you.

332
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,609
You're like an angel.

333
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,111
I wish I was.

334
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:21,582
Does all this seem strange to you?

335
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:37,456
Why don't you move your things in here,
into the house, while we're gone?

336
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,436
All right.

337
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,543
Bye.

338
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,388
Did you see this?

339
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,785
There's more right up there too.

340
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,762
You've never been in love before?

341
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,771
Why's that?

342
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,861
<i>We never been this rich, all right?</i>

343
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:47,487
<i>I mean, we were just,
all of a sudden...</i>

344
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,566
<i>livin' like kings.</i>

345
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:55,367
<i>Just nothin' to do all day
but crack jokes, lay around.</i>

346
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:57,497
<i>- Help!
- We didn't have to work.</i>

347
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:02,468
<i>I'm tellin' you,
the rich got it figured out.</i>

348
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,208
This.

349
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,216
Soft tickle.

350
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:51,594
<i>- Oh, Linda!
- Hey, don't. Please, go away.</i>

351
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,663
- Can you do anything?
- No.

352
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,096
That's not so. Show 'em that.

353
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,658
What? With potatoes?

354
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:02,204
<i>Uh-huh.
So this is what you do all day.</i>

355
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,273
- Hey! That's mine.
- Now it's for the dogs.

356
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:17,753
<i>I got to like this farm.</i>

357
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,755
<i>Do anything I want.</i>

358
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,825
<i>Roll in the fields...</i>

359
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,158
<i>talk to the wheat patches.</i>

360
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:28,424
<i>When I was sleepin',
they'd talk to me.</i>

361
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,395
<i>They'd go in my dreams.</i>

362
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:09,372
What's the matter with you?

363
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,373
- I get lonely by myself.
- Shh!

364
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,382
You see this bottle?
I want to break it.

365
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,855
- You're crazy.
- That sound dumb?

366
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,983
<i>What do you think?</i>

367
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,164
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

368
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,278
It scares me doing this,
you know?

369
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:59,347
Dropped my glass.

370
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,356
Doesn't matter.

371
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:14,262
<i>I never wanted
to fall in love with you.</i>

372
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,074
Nobody asked you to.

373
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,136
A minute ago you said
I was irresistible.

374
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:25,147
I still am.

375
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,651
Your hair's still the same.

376
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,177
<i>Abby?</i>

377
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,284
<i>Abby?</i>

378
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,961
Where you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

379
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:23,699
I couldn't sleep well.
I went out for a walk.

380
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:27,299
- You should've woke me up.
- I didn't want to.

381
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,838
<i>Nobody sent us letters.</i>

382
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,076
<i>We didn't receive no cards.</i>

383
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,464
<i>Sometimes I'd feel very old...</i>

384
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,534
<i>like my whole life's over...</i>

385
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:28,134
<i>like I'm not around no more.</i>

386
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,263
<i>Bet he likes looking at you in that.</i>

387
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,299
This?

388
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,378
I thought you liked it.

389
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:39,782
You don't like them, do ya?

390
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:42,044
You never have.

391
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:44,211
I don't think they're honest people.

392
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:48,083
As a matter of fact,
I think they're a pair of con artists.

393
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:57,526
You know, maybe you'd be better off
taking over the north end till spring.

394
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:03,261
I mean, we've been together a long time
and I've always felt close to you.

395
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:09,735
Just might work out better is all.
Less friction.

396
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,811
You're talkin' about my wife.

397
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,723
Maybe I'd better pack.

398
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,107
I know what you're doing.

399
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:48,711
That boy's like a son to me.

400
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:20,076
You know what I thought
when I first saw you?

401
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,482
I thought, "If only I could touch her,
then everything'd be all right. "

402
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:29,019
You make me feel like I've come
back to life. Isn't that funny?

403
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:36,128
I always thought that being alone was
just something that a man had to put up with.

404
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:39,031
It was like I just got used to it.

405
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:45,874
Sometimes it's like...

406
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:47,876
you're right inside of me,
you know...

407
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:52,608
like I can hear your voice
and feel your breath and everything.

408
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,861
Why are you so uneasy with me?

409
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:09,363
I'm sorry.

410
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:12,435
I don't blame you.
Did I make it sound like that?

411
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,510
You have a right to.

412
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:26,604
It's just that it seems
like I don't know you.

413
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:09,420
<i>Did you see him wave?</i>

414
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:13,553
- Here he is!
- There he goes!

415
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:16,962
- That's the president of the whole country.
- Ohh!

416
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,938
Will you help me up?

417
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,939
<i>Instead of gettin'sicker...</i>

418
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,009
<i>he just stayed the same.</i>

419
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:31,247
<i>He didn't get sicker,
he didn't get better.</i>

420
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,846
<i>They were kindhearted.</i>

421
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:40,787
<i>They thought he was going out
on his own steam.</i>

422
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:53,635
<i>I don't know. The doc musta come over
or somethin' and gave him somethin'.</i>

423
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:56,706
<i>Probably some kind of medicine
or somethin'.</i>

424
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:01,137
<i>I coulda just took it,
put it in a ditch...</i>

425
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,677
<i>like they do to a horse.</i>

426
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:09,308
<i>They shoot 'im right away.</i>

427
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,671
Buster, fetch.

428
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:37,474
<i>Whoa. Easy.</i>

429
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:41,807
Whoa, pup.

430
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,520
<i>Sally.</i>

431
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,756
<i>Whoa, pup.</i>

432
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,621
<i>Sally, Sally.</i>

433
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,099
<i>Whoa, pup.</i>

434
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:02,337
<i>Whoa. Whoa.</i>

435
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:04,407
<i>Whoa.</i>

436
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,795
You seem jumpy today.

437
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:31,459
I'm sick of these stinkin' birds.

438
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:34,469
- What's the matter?
- You don't wanna know about it.

439
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:30,318
<i>Just when things were
about to blow, this flyin' circus come in.</i>

440
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:37,764
<i>After six months on this wheat patch,
I needed a breath of fresh air.</i>

441
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:52,146
<i>They were screamin' and yellin'
and boppin' each other.</i>

442
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:55,149
<i>He- The big one
pushed the little one and said...</i>

443
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:57,151
<i>"Come on.
I start it, you start. "</i>

444
00:55:57,253 --> 00:56:00,916
<i>The little one just started in.</i>

445
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:05,085
<i>If they couldn't think of a good one
to come back with, they'd start fightin'.</i>

446
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:19,625
<i>The little one said:
"No, I didn't do this."</i>

447
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,576
The big one said:
"Yes, you did do this."

448
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:25,136
<i>You couldn't sort it out.</i>

449
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:28,945
I wanna give 'em a hand for this.

450
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,384
Hey! Bong!

451
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,391
<i>Mmm. Watch out.</i>

452
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:43,625
<i>Watch out, watch out.</i>

453
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:48,097
<i>The devil just sittin' there, laughin'.</i>

454
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:52,131
<i>He's glad when people does bad.</i>

455
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,574
<i>Then he sends 'em to the snake house.</i>

456
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:58,977
<i>He just sits there and laughs and watch
while you're sittin' there all tied up...</i>

457
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,983
<i>and snakes are eatin' your eyes out.</i>

458
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,986
<i>They go down your throat
and eat all your systems out.</i>

459
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,821
You're confusing me, you know.

460
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,227
Drivin' me crazy.

461
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:18,562
I don't know if I'm comin' or goin'.

462
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,727
You never did.

463
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:43,016
<i>I think the devil was on the farm.</i>

464
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:02,276
What's going on?

465
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,346
What's the matter?

466
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,551
You know what I mean.

467
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,656
Why do you let him
touch you like that?

468
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,799
What are you talking about?

469
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:28,501
I don't know how brothers and sisters act
where you come from -

470
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:31,073
<i>Did you ever have a sister?</i>

471
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,643
Well, then who are you to judge?

472
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:39,271
<i>Ah, buongiorno, signorina-</i>

473
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:44,753
Did you say anything to him?

474
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,617
Never seen him act like this before.

475
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:53,321
- He must think we're awful.
- What do you care what he thinks?

476
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:05,170
You're in love with him, aren't you?

477
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:16,544
<i>Are you leavin'?</i>

478
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:19,349
<i>- Yeah.
- What for?</i>

479
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:23,050
I got some business to take care of.
They're giving me a lift.

480
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,625
- Just like that, huh?
- Guess so.

481
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:54,080
<i>He seen how it all was.</i>

482
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:58,861
<i>She loves the farmer.</i>

483
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:48,568
<i>He taught me keys on the pianos
and notes.</i>

484
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:54,510
<i>He taught me about
the parts of a globe.</i>

485
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:31,719
Ohh!

486
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:37,282
And the mast here.
Then another great big one straight up here.

487
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:42,126
So here would be the - the front,
and then the bow.

488
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:03,505
- Bill!
- Hey, sprinkle!

489
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:05,904
- I missed you so much. Did you miss me?
- Yeah!

490
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,908
- How much?
- A lot!

491
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,205
- Hey. You look just the same.
- How you doin'?

492
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:12,213
We been readin' about you.

493
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:15,478
- What do you mean?
- Oh, about Chicago.

494
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:18,053
You come all that way by motorcycle?

495
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,552
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

496
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,185
You didn't do nothin' to me.

497
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:39,635
I didn't know what I had with you.

498
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:45,073
I think about it -

499
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:50,169
the things I said to you...

500
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,747
<i>how I pushed you into this.</i>

501
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:04,959
Got nobody to blame but myself.

502
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,800
I oughta get goin'...

503
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:14,870
before it gets too late.

504
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:17,916
Smoke 'em out!
Swat 'em out!

505
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:24,625
That way! Let's go! Come on!

506
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,573
What's this?

507
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,575
What are you doin'?

508
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:56,577
What do you care?

509
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:58,806
What are you doin'?

510
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:01,608
Are you crazy?

511
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:14,729
Catch 'em!

512
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:21,964
Let it burn!

513
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:24,631
Let it burn!

514
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:32,574
Get tractors! Blankets!

515
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:37,314
Catch that mare!

516
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,422
Get back!

517
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,523
He doesn't understand me.

518
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:19,093
What are we gonna do?

519
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:25,428
We gotta get out of here.

520
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,568
He knows.

521
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:07,236
- Do somethin'!
- Fire! Fire!

522
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:18,983
<i>- Up this way!
- Come here!</i>

523
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:21,521
<i>Don't stir them up!</i>

524
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:42,733
Help me get this ground -

525
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,294
- Comin' through here!
- Comin' this way!

526
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:06,458
Out of my way!

527
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:46,366
What did you want from me?

528
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:06,561
Wait!

529
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:12,466
You're a liar!

530
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,890
Pull it out?

531
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:40,339
Look, I'll tell you
the whole story later.

532
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:42,747
Nothing we can do about it now.

533
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,801
<i>Well, you're skinnin' me alive, but-</i>

534
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:03,803
And the Victrola.

535
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,896
- Even up?
- Yeah.

536
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:17,544
<i>Nobody's perfect.</i>

537
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:20,678
<i>There was never
a perfect person around.</i>

538
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:26,019
<i>You just got half devil
and half angel in you.</i>

539
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:46,207
<i>She promised herself
she'd lead a good life from now on.</i>

540
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:48,441
<i>She blamed it all on herself.</i>

541
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:58,788
It's good. I like it.

542
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:01,920
<i>She didn't care if she was happy or not.</i>

543
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:05,363
<i>She just wanted to make up
for what she did wrong.</i>

544
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:08,767
Got about a three-pound carp.

545
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:13,364
<i>The sun looks ghostly when there's a mist
on a river and everything's quiet.</i>

546
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,670
<i>I never knowed it before.</i>

547
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:21,942
<i>You could see people on the shore...</i>

548
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:25,645
<i>but it was far off and you couldn't see
what they were doin'.</i>

549
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:29,656
<i>They were probably
callin' for help or somethin'...</i>

550
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:34,718
<i>or they were tryin'
to bury somebody or somethin'.</i>

551
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:41,767
<i>We seen trees
that the leaves are shakin'...</i>

552
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:47,240
<i>and it looks like
shadows of guys comin' at you and stuff.</i>

553
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:52,740
<i>We heard owls squawkin' away,
hootin'away.</i>

554
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:57,851
<i>We didn't know where we were goin',
what we were gonna do.</i>

555
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:00,581
<i>I've never been on a boat before.</i>

556
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,554
<i>That was the first time.</i>

557
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:07,084
Have you seen her?

558
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:09,163
Where?

559
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:12,165
<i>Some sights that I saw was really spooky...</i>

560
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:15,532
<i>that it gave me goose pimples.</i>

561
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:18,105
<i>I felt like cold hands...</i>

562
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:21,664
<i>touchin' the back of my neck and-</i>

563
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:25,610
<i>And it could be the dead
comin' for me or somethin'.</i>

564
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:30,145
<i>I remember this guy-
his name was Black Jack.</i>

565
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:34,382
<i>He died.
He only had one leg, and he died.</i>

566
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:38,823
<i>And I think that was Black Jack
makin' those noises.</i>

567
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:38,577
Got 'er wedged in there.

568
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:45,049
- Grab it.
- Hold on, Randy.

569
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:52,858
There!

570
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,772
<i>Move over this way!</i>

571
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:10,307
<i>Whoa! Whoa, whoa!</i>

572
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:20,724
<i>Check out those trees!</i>

573
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:25,958
Steady.
Gotta be in here somewhere.

574
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:29,733
- What's going on?
- Keep down!

575
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:36,344
- Just stay here.
- Wait a minute -

576
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:48,983
<i>There!</i>

577
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:53,356
<i>- I'm gonna come around back that way.
- Don't let him get back to the river.</i>

578
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:06,639
<i>- Move over. Down this stretch!
- Check out those trees!</i>

579
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:21,110
<i>Watch it! He's going around
the other side of that bank!</i>

580
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,059
<i>The other's goin' the other way!</i>

581
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:37,828
Come on!

582
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:42,542
<i>- Buck!
- Back over there!</i>

583
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:45,545
<i>You!
You go over there!</i>

584
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:48,946
<i>I'm gonna go this way. You go over there!</i>

585
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,315
<i>He's in here somewhere!</i>

586
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:05,190
<i>- Hey, Linder!
- Check it there! Check it there!</i>

587
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:11,666
Over there! There!

588
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:49,102
It'll work out. Right?

589
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:52,298
- Mmm.
- You'll make lots of friends.

590
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:18,232
You'll be all right.

591
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:21,969
Now turn around and go inside.

592
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:47,886
<i>Oranges.</i>

593
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:55,260
<i>Oranges. Oranges.</i>

594
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:57,338
<i>Oranges.</i>

595
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:08,373
<i>- Big barrel of coal.
- Yeah, I saw! I saw!</i>

596
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:22,354
<i>Keep safe, boys.</i>

597
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:57,562
<i>Hey, come look!</i>

598
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:08,735
Come on! Come on!

599
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:12,335
Don't worry about all that stuff.
I got a new boyfriend. He's in the army.

600
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:15,348
Maybe he'll get killed or somethin'.

601
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:18,476
I don't know. Anyway, he said I'm pretty.
And maybe I am.

602
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:20,486
Look at this!

603
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:23,489
Come on. Come on.
Hey, what'd you do at that school anyway?

604
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:25,559
Ballet!

605
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:47,005
Yeah, I got it!
Get in the alley! Hurry up!

606
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:53,376
I don't wait two hours for nobody.

607
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:58,391
Maybe he don't have a watch.

608
01:29:58,493 --> 01:30:01,462
Yeah. If I believe that,
he'll tell me another.

609
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:05,563
His name was Edward.

610
01:30:07,668 --> 01:30:10,136
He was nice. I liked him.

611
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:13,139
I don't know.
He said he was gonna buy me a fur.

612
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,971
I always wanted a fur.

613
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:19,205
- Where ya goin'?
- For a walk.

614
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:22,640
I don't know where, but -

615
01:30:24,385 --> 01:30:27,616
Go - Go beat the heck
out of some tree or somethin'.

616
01:30:27,722 --> 01:30:29,622
Take it out on them.

617
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:31,624
You comin' with me or what?

618
01:30:31,726 --> 01:30:34,627
<i>This girl,
she didn't know where she was goin'...</i>

619
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:36,629
<i>or what she was gonna do.</i>

620
01:30:36,731 --> 01:30:39,359
<i>She didn't have no money on her.</i>

621
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:43,704
<i>Maybe she'd meet up with a character.</i>

622
01:30:45,139 --> 01:30:48,040
<i>I was hopin'
things would work out for her.</i>

623
01:30:48,142 --> 01:30:50,610
<i>She was a good friend of mine.</i>
