1
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,000
I sure do love you.

2
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,800
.Good morning.
.Good morning, Mrs. MacNeil.

3
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,500
.How are you today?
.Fine, thank you.

4
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,300
It's okay, I've got it. Thanks.

5
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,500
.Good morning, madam.
.Good morning, Karl.

6
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,400
Oh, Karl, we've got rats in the attic.
You'd better get some traps.

7
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Rats?

8
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,700
I'm afraid so.

9
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,500
But the attic is clean.

10
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,700
All right, then, we've got clean rats.

11
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,200
.No rats.
.I just heard them, Karl.

12
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,000
Maybe plumbing.

13
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,200
Yeah, or maybe rats.
Now, will you just get the traps?

14
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Yes, I go now.

15
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,200
.Don't go now. The stores aren't open yet.
.I'll go see.

16
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,000
They're closed!

17
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,100
In the group over here,
I need a couple of priests, a nun....

18
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,700
That's exactly what we want.

19
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,000
Is this scene really essential? Would you
just consider if we can do without it?

20
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,600
Look at this damn thing.
It just doesn't make sense.

21
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,900
It's plain. You're a teacher of the college.
You don't want the building torn down.

22
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,800
.I can read, for Christ's sake!
.Well, what's wrong?

23
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,200
Well, why are they tearing
the building down?

24
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,100
Shall we summon the writer?
He's in Paris, I believe.

25
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,900
Hiding?

26
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,800
Fucking.

27
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,800
Scene 39: Hotel. Take four.

28
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,200
All right. Hustle back on in.

29
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,600
Is this your campus?

30
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,500
Let's get the Defense Department
off this campus!

31
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,300
It's our school!

32
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,200
They have no right!

33
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,300
I've seen enough killing in my life!

34
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,800
There's no reason for it anymore!

35
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
Wait a minute!

36
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,900
We're all concerned with human rights,
for God's sake...

37
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,400
...but the kids who want
to get an education have a right, too!

38
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,400
Don't you understand? It's against
your own principle, for God's sake!

39
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,200
You can't accomplish anything
by shutting kids off from their....

40
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,700
If you want to effect any change,
you have to do it within the system.

41
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,700
Okay, cut! That's a wrap.

42
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,200
I think I'll walk home tonight, Mike.
Here, take that and drop it by my house.

43
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,000
Good night, Tom.

44
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,100
There's not a day in my life
that I don't feel like a fraud.

45
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,200
I mean, priests, doctors, lawyers.
I've talked to them all.

46
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,600
I don't know anyone who hasn't felt that.

47
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Hello?

48
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,500
In here.

49
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,800
.Hi. How did your day go?
.Not too bad.

50
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It was like the Walt Disney version
of the Ho Chi Minh Story.

51
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,400
Other than that, it was terrific.
What have we got, anything exciting?

52
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,400
Also, you got an invitation.

53
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,800
What's this?

54
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,200
Dinner at the White House.

55
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,600
You're kidding!
ls it a big party or something?

56
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,300
I think it's five or six people.

57
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,600
Thursday? All right.

58
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,900
Hi, Mom.

59
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,300
What did you do today?

60
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,400
.Stuff.
.What does "stuff" mean?

61
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,900
Me and Sharon played a game
in the backyard.

62
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
And we had a picnic down by the river.

63
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,100
Mom, you should have seen it!

64
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,200
This man came along
on this beautiful gray horse.

65
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,700
Really? What kind?

66
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,200
Was it a mare, a gelding?

67
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,600
I think it was a gelding.

68
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,000
It was gray.

69
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It was so beautiful.

70
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,500
The guy let me ride it
all around and everything.

71
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,400
She rode it for about half an hour.

72
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,000
I loved it! Mom, can't we get a horse?

73
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,000
.Not while we're in Washington, honey.
.Why not, Mom?

74
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,100
We'll see when we get home, okay?

75
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,000
.When could I have one?
.We'll see, Regan. We'll see.

76
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,000
On the party invitations,
I want to write a personal..

77
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,500
Regan, don't! Come back!

78
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,700
.All right, give it up. Give it up!
.No!

79
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,200
You'll be sorry!

80
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Father?

81
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,000
Could you help an old altar boy?

82
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
I'm a Catholic.

83
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Mama?

84
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,900
.I'm so glad to see you.
.You look good.

85
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,200
I'm all right.

86
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,400
.How's your leg?
.How about you? You are all right?

87
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
I'm fine, Mama.

88
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Your Uncle John...

89
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
...passed by to visit me.

90
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Really? When?

91
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Last month.

92
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,900
.Is that too tight?
.No.

93
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,200
You have to stay off it. You can't go
up and down the stairs. Give it a rest.

94
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,800
Okay.

95
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,200
I could take you somewhere where
you'd be safe. You wouldn't be alone.

96
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,600
There would be people around.

97
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,100
You wouldn't be sitting here
listening to the radio.

98
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,800
You understand me?

99
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,100
This is my house
and I'm not going no place.

100
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,200
Dimmy, you worry for something?

101
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,000
.No, Mama.
.You are not happy?

102
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,800
Tell me, what is the matter?

103
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,300
Mama, I'm all right. I'm fine. Really, I am.

104
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,100
Here it comes.

105
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
There!

106
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,100
.Look at that!
.Do you like it?

107
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,900
Isn't that funny?

108
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,300
I better put him over here to dry, though.
He's still wet.

109
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,100
Hey, where did this come from?

110
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,600
.I found it.
.Where?

111
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,700
In the closet.

112
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,200
Have you been playing with it?

113
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,900
.Yep.
.Do you know how?

114
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,600
I'll show you.

115
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,400
Wait a minute. You need two.

116
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,400
No, you don't. I do it all the time.

117
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,300
Well, let's both play.

118
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,400
You really don't want me to play?

119
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,100
No, I do! Captain Howdy said no.

120
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
.Captain who?
.Captain Howdy.

121
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,000
Who's Captain Howdy?

122
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,100
You know. I make the questions
and he does the answers.

123
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,300
.Captain Howdy. I see.
.He's nice.

124
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,800
I'll bet he is.

125
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,100
Here, I'll show you.

126
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,600
Captain Howdy,
do you think my mom is pretty?

127
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,800
Captain Howdy, that isn't very nice.

128
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,700
.Maybe he's sleeping.
.You think?

129
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Why are you reading that stuff?.

130
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,900
Because I like it.

131
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,000
It's not even a good picture of you.

132
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,500
.You look so mature.
.I wouldn't talk!

133
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,100
You wouldn't talk?

134
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
I didn't have my makeup man there.

135
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Let me take an eyelash off your face.

136
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,200
No, I didn't get it.

137
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,600
What are we going to do on your birthday?
lsn't it nice it's on Sunday this year?

138
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,100
No work? What can we do?

139
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,300
I don't know.

140
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,700
What would you like to do? Got any ideas?

141
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,900
Let me think....

142
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,100
We never finished seeing all the sights
in Washington.

143
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,500
We didn't get to the Lee Mansion,
lots of stuff.

144
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,500
Shall we do that? Go sightseeing?

145
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,500
.If it's a nice day?
.Yeah, let's do that.

146
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,600
And tomorrow night,
I'll take you to a movie.

147
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,000
I love you!

148
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,200
I love you, Rags.

149
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,500
We'll have a good day.

150
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,100
You can bring Mr. Dennings, if you like.

151
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,400
Mr. Dennings?

152
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,000
Well, you know, it's okay.

153
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,900
Thank you very much...

154
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,700
...but why would I want to bring Burke
on your birthday?

155
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,000
Well, you like him.

156
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,200
Yeah, I like him. Don't you like him?
What's going on? What is this?

157
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,400
You're going to marry him, aren't you?

158
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,700
You've got to be kidding!
Me marry Burke Dennings?

159
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,000
Don't be silly. Of course not.

160
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,200
Where did you ever get an idea like that?

161
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,600
But you like him.

162
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,800
Of course I like him. I like pizzas too,
but I'm not going to marry one.

163
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,600
You don't like him like Daddy?

164
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,000
Regan, I love your daddy.

165
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,600
I'll always love your daddy, honey.

166
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,100
Burke just comes around here a lot
because...

167
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,200
...well, he's lonely.
He don't got nothing to do!

168
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,800
Well, I heard differently.

169
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,300
Oh, you did? What did you hear?

170
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,200
I don't know. I just thought.

171
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,900
Well, you didn't think so good.

172
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,600
How do you know?

173
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,200
Because Burke and I are just friends.
Okay? Really.

174
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,100
Are you ready for sleep?

175
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,000
Good night, honey.

176
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,500
It's my mother, Tom.

177
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,000
She's alone and I never
should have left her.

178
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,200
At least in New York, I'd be near her.
I'd be close to her.

179
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,400
I could see about a transfer, Damien.

180
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,800
I need reassignment, Tom. I want out
of this job. It's wrong, it's no good.

181
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,800
You're the best we've got.

182
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,600
Am I really?

183
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,600
It's more than psychiatry,
and you know that, Tom.

184
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,100
Some of their problems
come down to their faith...

185
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,800
...their vocation, the meaning of their lives,
and I can't cut it any more.

186
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,400
I need out. I'm unfit.

187
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,800
I think I've lost my faith, Tom.

188
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,300
Hello?

189
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,200
Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil.

190
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,100
Operator, you have got to be kidding!

191
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,700
I have been on this line for 20 minutes!

192
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,500
Jesus Christ! Can you believe this?

193
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,800
He doesn't even call his daughter
on her birthday!

194
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
Maybe the circuit is busy.

195
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,900
Circuit, my ass! He doesn't give a shit!

196
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
.Why don't you let me..
.No, I've got it, Sharon. It's all right.

197
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,400
Don't tell me there's no answer.
It's the Hotel Excelsior in Rome!

198
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,900
Would you try it again, please,
and let it ring?

199
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,800
Hello? Yes.

200
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,300
No, Operator,
I've given you the number four times!

201
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,200
Do you take an illiteracy test
to get that job, for Christ's sake?

202
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,400
Don't tell me to be calm, goddamn it!

203
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,600
Hello

204
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,100
You're kidding me!

205
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,300
I thought I just went to bed.

206
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,700
What are we doing, Scene 61?

207
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,900
Just remind Flo about that blue belt.

208
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,300
What are you doing here?

209
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,000
My bed was shaking.

210
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,900
I can't get to sleep.

211
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,100
Goddamn it!

212
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,800
Jesus Christ, Karl, don't do that!

213
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm very sorry, but you see? No rats.

214
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,300
No rats. Thanks a lot. That's terrific.

215
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Oh, my God!

216
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,600
The edema affected her brain,
you understand?

217
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,300
She don't let no doctor come near her.

218
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,000
She was all the time screaming,
even talking to the radio.

219
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,100
You should've called me when it happened.

220
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,800
Regular hospital is not going
to put up with that, Dimmy.

221
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,800
We give her a shot and bring her here...

222
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,800
...until the doctors fix up her leg,
then we take her right out.

223
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,200
Two or three months and she's out,
good as new!

224
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,200
We want to see Mrs. Karras.

225
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,800
.Do you have an appointment?
.Yes.

226
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,400
.Are you a relative?
.I am her brother. He is her son.

227
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Just a minute.

228
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,600
You know, it's funny.

229
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
If you weren't a priest, you'd be
a famous psychiatrist now on Park Avenue.

230
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,900
Your mother would be living
in a penthouse instead of there.

231
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,200
You go in, Dimmy. I'll wait for you outside.

232
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,800
You'll find Mrs. Karras on the last bed
on the left.hand side.

233
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,300
It's Dimmy, Mama.

234
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,300
Why did you do this to me, Dimmy?

235
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,900
Why?

236
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,800
Come on, I'll take you out of here.
Mama, I'm going to take you home.

237
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,400
Mama, everything's going to be all right.
I'm going to take you home.

238
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,000
.Couldn't you have put her someplace else?
.Like what?

239
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,400
Private hospital?
Who's got the money for that?

240
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
You?

241
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,800
There seems to be an alien pubic hair
in my drink.

242
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I beg your pardon?

243
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,200
Never seen it before in my life. Have you?

244
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,700
...compared to the Gemini and Mercury
programs, which were tight for space.

245
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,900
We've got about 210 cubic feet,
so we can move around.

246
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,600
If you ever go up there again,
will you take me along?

247
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,800
What for?

248
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,700
First missionary on Mars!

249
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,400
Tell me, was it public relations you did
for the Gestapo or community relations?

250
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,700
I'm Swiss!

251
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,900
Yes, of course.

252
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,000
And you never went bowling
with Goebbels, either, I suppose.

253
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,800
Nazi bastard!

254
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,600
Over behind the church. You know where
I mean? It's a red brick wing.

255
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,600
What goes on there?
Who's the priest I keep seeing there?

256
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,100
He's there all the time. He has black hair
and he's very intense looking.

257
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,000
.Who's that?
.Damien Karras.

258
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,900
That's his office the back of Saint Mike's.
He's our psychiatric counselor.

259
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,600
He had a pretty rough knock last night,
poor guy. His mother passed away.

260
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,500
She was living by herself, and...

261
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,900
...l guess she was dead a couple of days
before they found her.

262
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,500
Cunting Hun!

263
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,700
Bloody, damned, butchering, Nazi pig!

264
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,900
Stop it! I'll kill you!

265
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,400
What's for dessert?

266
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,400
You sleeping?

267
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,800
Burke, your car's at the curb.
Louie's waiting. It's nice and warm.

268
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,800
Yes, honey. What?

269
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
Fuck it.

270
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,100
.Was he acting up!
.Blind is what he was.

271
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,200
Hi, Chris. It's a great party.

272
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,800
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.

273
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,800
I don't need any encouragement. My idea
of heaven is a solid white nightclub...

274
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,800
...with me as a headliner for all eternity,
and they love me.

275
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,300
"Down on the eastside
of toidy.toid and toid

276
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,800
"That's my home sweet home! "

277
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,900
I think we've got a guest.

278
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,000
You're going to die up there.

279
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,400
Oh, my God, honey.

280
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,300
Honey, what's the matter?

281
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,900
I'm sorry, she's been sick.
She didn't know what she was saying.

282
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,400
What made you say that, Regan?

283
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,300
Do you know, sweetheart?

284
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,000
Mother?

285
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,400
What's wrong with me?

286
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,000
It's just like the doctor said.
It's nerves, and that's all.

287
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,000
You just take your pills
and you'll be fine. Really.

288
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,400
Okay?

289
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,800
Is it coming out, Willie?

290
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,800
Yes, I think so.

291
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,900
Mother!

292
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,200
Where'd you get the money
for the Chivas Regal, the poor box?

293
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,000
That's an insult. I've got a vow of poverty.

294
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,600
Where'd you get it, then?

295
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,800
I stole it.

296
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,700
I believe you.

297
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,200
College presidents shouldn't drink.
Tends to set a bad example.

298
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,600
I figure I saved him from a big temptation.

299
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,400
Oh, Christ!

300
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,000
I should have been there. I wasn't there.

301
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,900
There was nothing you could do.

302
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,700
Lie down.

303
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,400
Give me the butt. Come on.

304
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,500
.Now you think you can sleep?
.Yes.

305
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,900
.Are you going to steal my shoes now?
.No.

306
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,500
I tell fortunes by reading the creases.
Now, shut up and go to sleep.

307
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,200
Good night.

308
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,800
Stealing is a sin.

309
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,600
I don't want it!

310
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,100
Honey, it's to help you.

311
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,900
I don't want it!

312
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,600
You fucking bastard!

313
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,000
Remember also, O Lord,
Thy servant, Mary Karras...

314
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,900
...who has gone before us...

315
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
...with the sign of faith,
and sleeps the sleep of peace.

316
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,200
"Lord, I am not worthy to receive you.

317
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,600
"But only say the Word
and I shall be healed.

318
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,800
"May the body of Christ bring thee
to everlasting life."

319
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,100
It's a symptom...

320
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,200
...of a type of disturbance in
the chemical.electrical activity of the brain.

321
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,500
In your daughter's case,
in the temporal lobe.

322
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
Up here in the lateral part of the brain.

323
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,000
It's rare, but it does cause
bizarre hallucinations...

324
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
...and usually just before a convulsion.

325
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,500
A convulsion?

326
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,700
The shaking of the bed.
That's doubtless due to muscular spasms.

327
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,900
No, no, that was no spasm.

328
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,800
I got on the bed.

329
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,500
The whole bed was thumping
and rising off the floor...

330
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,200
...and shaking, the whole thing!
With me on it!

331
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,500
Mrs. MacNeil, the problem
with your daughter is not her bed.

332
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,700
It's her brain.

333
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,200
What causes this?

334
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,400
Lesion in the temporal lobe.

335
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,200
It's a kind of seizure disorder.

336
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Look, Doc, I really don't understand
how her whole personality could change.

337
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,800
In the temporal lobe, it's very common.

338
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,800
It is?

339
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,100
It can last for days, even weeks.

340
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,400
It isn't rare to find destructive...

341
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,600
...even criminal behavior.

342
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,300
Hey, do me a favor, will you?
Tell me something good.

343
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,400
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion,
in a way, she's fortunate.

344
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,800
All we have to do is remove the scar.

345
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,400
Regan, can you sit up and scoot over here?

346
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,800
A little more.

347
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,800
Good.

348
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,700
I'm just going to move you down
on the table, okay?

349
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,000
That's just for a short time.

350
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,000
You're doing fine.

351
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,400
Very sticky.

352
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,900
Now, Regan, you're going to feel
something a little cold and wet.

353
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,900
Now you're going to feel a little stick here.
Don't move.

354
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,300
Good.

355
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,300
You're going to feel some pressure here.
Now, don't move.

356
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,800
Hook up!

357
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,000
There's nothing there.

358
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,200
No vascular displacement at all.

359
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,600
Do you want me to run another series?

360
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,100
I don't think so.

361
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,700
I'd like you to see her again.

362
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,000
Excuse me, Doctor.
Chris MacNeil is on the phone.

363
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,300
She says it's urgent.

364
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,400
Have you got some time?

365
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,400
Dr. Klein?

366
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,600
Yes, I'm Dr. Klein. This is Dr. Tanney.

367
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,400
Things have gotten worse since I phoned.
Come upstairs.

368
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,800
.Is she having spasms again?
.Yes, but they're violent.

369
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,900
.You gave her the medication?
.Yes.

370
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,700
.What was that?
.Thorazine.

371
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,200
Before that, it was Ritalin.

372
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,600
Chris, doctors.

373
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,800
Mother, please!

374
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,200
Please, Mother, make him stop!

375
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,600
It's burning! It's burning!

376
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,700
Do something, Doctor. Please, help her!

377
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,800
Make him stop! He's trying to kill me!

378
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,500
Mother!

379
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,700
Keep away!

380
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,300
The sow is mine!

381
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,100
Fuck me!

382
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,500
Fuck me!

383
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,600
Stay away from me!

384
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,600
Hold her tight!

385
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,600
Don't let them, Mother, please!

386
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,200
She's heavily sedated.

387
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.

388
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,200
What was going on in there?
How could she fly off the bed like that?

389
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,400
Pathological states can induce
abnormal strength...

390
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,500
...accelerated motor performance.

391
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,700
For example...

392
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,400
...say a 90.pound woman sees her child
pinned under the wheel of a truck...

393
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,800
...runs out and lifts the wheels
a half a foot up off the ground.

394
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,600
You've heard the story. Same thing here.

395
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,800
Same principle, I mean.

396
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,300
So what's wrong with her?

397
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,900
We still think that the temporal lobe..

398
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,700
What are you talking about,
for Christ's sake?

399
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,600
Did you see her or not?

400
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,200
She's acting like she's fucking
out of her mind!

401
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,700
Psychotic, like a split personality, or....

402
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,100
There haven't been more
than 100 authentic cases...

403
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,000
...of so.called "split personality,"
Mrs. MacNeil.

404
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,100
Now, I know the temptation is
to leap to psychiatry...

405
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:45,500
...but any reasonable psychiatrist would
exhaust the somatic possibilities first.

406
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,400
So, what's next?

407
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,500
A pneumoencephalogram,
I would think, to pin down that lesion.

408
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,800
It will involve another spinal.

409
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,000
Oh, Christ!

410
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,400
What we missed in the EEG
and the arteriograms...

411
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,600
...could conceivably turn up there.

412
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,700
At least it would eliminate
certain other possibilities.

413
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,200
Dr. Tanney says the X.rays are negative.

414
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,900
In other words: normal.

415
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,100
Do you keep any drugs in your house?

416
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,000
No, of course not. Nothing like that.

417
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,800
Are you sure?

418
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,900
Of course, I'm sure.

419
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,200
I'd tell you.

420
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,400
Christ, I don't even smoke grass.

421
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Are you planning to be home soon?

422
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,600
I mean to L.A.

423
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,200
No, l....

424
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,600
I'm building a new house.

425
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,300
My old one has been sold.

426
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,900
I was going to take Regan to Europe
for a while after she finished school.

427
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:23,800
Why do you ask?

428
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,400
I think it's time we started
looking for a psychiatrist.

429
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,700
Hello?

430
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,900
What do you mean going off
and leaving Regan by herself?.

431
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,900
Are you crazy? Her window's wide open!

432
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,200
.Didn't he tell you?
.Didn't who tell me?

433
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,000
What's Burke got to do with it?

434
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,400
Nobody was here.
When I went to get the Thorazine...

435
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,200
...l had him stay with her, and....

436
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,600
.I should have known better.
.I guess you should have!

437
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,800
How were the tests?

438
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,100
We have to start looking for a shrink.

439
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,000
Hi, Chuck. Come on in.

440
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,400
I suppose you heard.

441
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,000
Heard what?

442
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,900
You haven't heard.

443
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,000
Burke is dead.

444
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:56,000
He must've been drunk.
He fell from the top of the steps outside.

445
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,400
By the time he hit M Street,
he broke his neck.

446
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Oh, God!

447
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,300
Yeah, I know.

448
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,400
When I touch your forehead,
open your eyes.

449
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,800
Are you comfortable, Regan?

450
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,700
Yes.

451
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,500
How old are you?

452
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,200
Twelve.

453
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,400
Is there someone inside you?

454
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,100
Sometimes.

455
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:42,800
Who is it?

456
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,900
I don't know.

457
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,500
Is it Captain Howdy?

458
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,400
I don't know.

459
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,600
If I ask him to tell me,
will you let him answer?

460
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,400
No.

461
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,700
Why not?

462
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,800
I'm afraid.

463
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,700
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you.

464
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,600
Do you want him to leave you?

465
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,500
Yes.

466
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,700
I'm speaking to the person
inside of Regan now.

467
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,000
If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized...

468
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,400
...and must answer all my questions.

469
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,300
Come forward...

470
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,800
...and answer me now.

471
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,800
Are you the person inside of Regan?

472
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,000
Who are you?

473
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,300
Father Karras?

474
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:48,900
Have we met?

475
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,000
No, we haven't met,
but they said I could tell.

476
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,900
That you look like a boxer.

477
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,200
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.

478
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,800
What's this all about?

479
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,300
It's true. You do look like a boxer.

480
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,500
Like John Garfield in Body And Soul.

481
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,400
Exactly. John Garfield.
Do people tell you that, Father?

482
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Do people say you look like Paul Newman?

483
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,000
Always.

484
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,000
You know this director
who was doing the film here...

485
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,800
...Burke Dennings?

486
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,000
I've seen him.

487
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,800
You've seen him.

488
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,200
You're also familiar how last week he died?

489
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,600
Only what I read in the papers.

490
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,900
Father, what do you know
on the subject of witchcraft?

491
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,200
From the witching end, not the hunting.

492
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,800
I once did a paper on it.

493
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,200
Really?

494
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,000
From the psychiatric end.

495
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,200
I know. I read it.

496
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,200
All of this desecration in the church...

497
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,000
...do you think this has anything to do
with witchcraft?

498
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,500
Maybe. Some rituals used
in the Black Mass.

499
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,800
And now Dennings. You read how he died?

500
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,600
In a fall.

501
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,400
Let me tell you how. Please, Father...

502
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,100
...confidential.

503
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,200
Burke Dennings, good Father...

504
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,200
...was found at the bottom of those steps
leading to M street...

505
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,800
...with his head turned completely around...

506
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,400
...facing backwards.

507
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,900
That didn't happen in the fall?

508
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,400
It's possible.

509
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,700
.Possible, however..
.Unlikely.

510
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,600
Exactly.

511
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:51,400
So, on the one hand,
we've got a witchcraft kind of murder...

512
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:56,200
...and on the other hand, a Black Mass.type
desecration in the church.

513
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,200
You think the killer
and the desecrator are the same?

514
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,000
Maybe somebody crazy...

515
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:06,000
...somebody with a spite
against the Church.

516
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,600
Some unconscious rebellion.

517
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,200
A sick priest, is that it?

518
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:14,300
Look, Father, this is hard for you.
Please, I understand...

519
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,300
...but for priests on the campus here,
you're the psychiatrist.

520
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,700
You'd know who was sick at the time,
who wasn't.

521
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,100
I mean, this kind of sickness,
you'd know that.

522
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,000
I don't know anyone
who fits that description.

523
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,500
Doctor's ethics.
If you knew, you wouldn't tell?

524
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,900
No, I probably wouldn't.

525
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,900
Not to bother you with trivia,
but a psychiatrist...

526
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,500
...in sunny California, no less...

527
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,700
...was put in jail for not telling the police
what he knew about a patient.

528
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Is that a threat?

529
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,000
No, I mention it only in passing.

530
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,700
Incidentally, I mention it only in passing...

531
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,800
...l could always tell the judge
it was a matter of confession.

532
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,800
Father, wait a minute!

533
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,900
.Do you like movies?
.Very much.

534
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,600
Well, I get passes
to the best shows in town.

535
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,100
Mrs. K, you know,
she gets tired, never likes to go.

536
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,800
That's too bad.

537
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,000
I hate to go alone.

538
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,500
I love to talk film...

539
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,200
...discuss, to critique.

540
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,100
You want to see a film with me?
I've got passes to the Crest. It's Othello.

541
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,900
Who's in it?

542
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,700
Debbie Reynolds: Desdemona and Othello:
Groucho Marx. Are you happy?

543
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,400
I've seen it.

544
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,900
One last time. Can you think
of some priest who fits the bill?

545
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,600
Come on!

546
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,400
No, answer the question, Father Paranoia.

547
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,900
All right.

548
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,400
You know who I think really did it?

549
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,200
Who?

550
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,200
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.

551
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,900
I could have you deported, you know that?

552
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,300
I lied.

553
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,600
You look like Sal Mineo.

554
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,900
It looks like a type of disorder
that's rarely ever seen anymore...

555
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,100
...except in primitive cultures.

556
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,900
We call it "somnambular.form possession. "

557
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:17,400
Quite frankly, we really don't know
much about it at all, except that...

558
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,200
...it starts with a conflict or a guilt...

559
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,800
...and it leads to the patient's delusions
that his body has been invaded...

560
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,800
...by some alien intelligence:

561
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,000
A spirit, if you will.

562
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,400
Look, I'm telling you again,
and you'd better believe me...

563
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,400
...l am not going to lock her up
in some goddamn asylum!

564
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,500
And I don't care what you call it.
I'm not putting her away!

565
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,600
I'm sorry.

566
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,500
You're sorry? Jesus Christ!

567
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,100
88 doctors and all you can tell me,
with all your bullshit is....

568
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:08,600
Of course, there is one outside chance
for a cure.

569
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,400
I think of it as a shock treatment.

570
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,900
As I said, it's a very outside chance.

571
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,500
Would you just name it, for God's sake?
What is it?

572
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,200
.Do you have any religious beliefs?
.No.

573
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,100
What about your daughter?

574
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:27,600
No.

575
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,700
Why?

576
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,600
Have you ever heard of exorcism?

577
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,300
Well, it's a stylized ritual in which the...

578
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:41,100
...rabbi or the priest try to drive out
the so.called invading spirit.

579
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It's been discarded these days...

580
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:48,800
...except by the Catholics, who keep it
in the closet as a sort of embarrassment.

581
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,100
But it has worked...

582
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,600
...in fact, although,
not for the reasons they think.

583
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,300
It's purely force of suggestion.

584
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:01,800
The victim's belief in possession...

585
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,000
...is what helped cause it,
so in that same way...

586
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,100
...the belief in the power of exorcism
can make it disappear.

587
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,000
You're telling me I should take
my daughter to a witch doctor.

588
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,500
Is that it?

589
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,200
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?

590
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,700
She's going to be well?

591
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:06,300
Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom,
I want you to tell me. Now, did you?

592
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,600
No, not me.

593
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,600
I didn't.

594
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,900
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?

595
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,700
Of course, I didn't.

596
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,600
I didn't put it.

597
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,300
Excuse me, madam.

598
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,300
What?

599
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,500
.A man to see you.
.What man?

600
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,100
Might your daughter remember, perhaps...

601
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,000
...if Mr. Dennings was in her room
that night?

602
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:56,900
Why do you ask?

603
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,400
Might she remember?

604
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,500
No, she was heavily sedated.

605
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,600
It's serious?

606
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,000
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

607
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,600
May I ask...?

608
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:12,900
We still don't know.

609
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,500
Watch out for drafts.

610
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,000
A draft in the fall,
when the house is hot, is...

611
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,500
...a magic carpet for bacteria.

612
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,700
Excuse me, madam. Anything else?

613
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,700
No, Karl, we're fine. Thank you.

614
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,400
It's all right.

615
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,900
Why are you asking all this?

616
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,100
It's strange.

617
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,900
The deceased comes to visit,
stays only 20 minutes...

618
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:43,200
...and leaves all alone a very sick girl.

619
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,100
And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil...

620
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:51,400
...it isn't likely he would fall
from a window.

621
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,500
Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck
what we found.

622
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,800
Except maybe one chance in a thousand.

623
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,100
No. My hunch....

624
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,500
My opinion...

625
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:08,300
...he was killed by a very powerful man:
point one.

626
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,100
And the fracturing of his skull: point two...

627
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,600
...plus the various other things
we mentioned...

628
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,900
...would make it very probable...

629
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,700
...probable, not certain...

630
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:26,700
...that the deceased was killed and then
pushed from your daughter's window.

631
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:32,100
But nobody was in the room
except your daughter, so how can this be?

632
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,500
It could be one way.

633
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,700
If someone came calling
between the time Miss Spencer left...

634
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,400
...and the time you returned.

635
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,600
Judas Priest, just a second.

636
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,900
The servants? They have visitors?

637
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,200
Not at all.

638
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,800
You were expecting a package that day,
some delivery?

639
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,100
Not that I know of.

640
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,900
Groceries, cleaning...a package?

641
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,400
I really wouldn't know.
Karl takes care of all that.

642
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,700
I see.

643
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,400
Would you like to ask him?

644
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:07,200
No, never mind, it's...

645
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,900
...it's very remote.

646
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,100
No, never mind.

647
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,700
Would you like some more coffee?

648
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,300
Please.

649
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,300
That's cute.

650
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,700
Your daughter, she's the artist?

651
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,700
Thank you.

652
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,200
Incidentally...

653
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,000
...you might ask your daughter...

654
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,700
...if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings
in her room that night.

655
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,100
Look, he wouldn't have any reason
in the world to go up to her room.

656
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,500
I know, I realize, but...

657
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,900
...if certain British doctors never asked,
"What is this fungus?"...

658
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,300
...we wouldn't today have penicillin.
Correct?

659
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,300
When she's better, I'll ask her.

660
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,600
It couldn't hurt.

661
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,000
In the meantime....

662
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,300
That's okay.

663
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,200
I really hate to ask you this, but...

664
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:52,000
...for my daughter,
could you please give an autograph?

665
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,100
Of course. Where's a pencil?

666
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,700
Right here.

667
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,500
She'd love it!

668
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,500
What's her name?

669
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,100
I lied. It's for me.

670
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,900
The spelling is on the back: Kinderman.

671
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,900
You know that film you made, Angel?.

672
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,900
I saw that six times!

673
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,900
Really?

674
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,100
It was beautiful.

675
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,500
Thank you.

676
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,500
You're a very nice lady.

677
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,700
.Thank you.
.You're a nice man.

678
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,500
I'll come back when she's feeling better.

679
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,200
.'Bye.
.'Bye.

680
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,900
Please, no!

681
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,000
.Do it!
.Please, don't!

682
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,200
You bitch! Do it!

683
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,200
Please, no!

684
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,300
Let Jesus fuck you!

685
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:20,300
Let Jesus fuck you!

686
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,300
Give it! Give it to me!

687
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,300
Lick me! Lick me!

688
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:43,900
Mrs. MacNeil, open the door!

689
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:57,500
Do you know what she did,
your cunting daughter?

690
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:17,800
Chris MacNeil?

691
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,500
Please go away.

692
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,800
I'm Father Karras.

693
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,800
I'm very sorry. Hello.

694
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,800
I should have told you
I wouldn't be in uniform.

695
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,500
Yeah, that would have helped.

696
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,300
Have you got a cigarette, Father?

697
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,000
Thanks.

698
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:49,800
Cold.

699
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,500
How did a shrink ever get to be a priest?

700
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,900
It's the other way around. The Society
sent me through medical school.

701
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:03,200
Where?

702
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,700
Harvard, Bellevue...

703
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,500
...Johns Hopkins. Places like that.

704
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,700
.You're a friend of Father Dyer's, right?
.Yes, I am.

705
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:16,700
.Pretty close?
.Pretty close.

706
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,100
Did he talk to you about my party?

707
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,300
He sure did.

708
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,700
About my daughter?

709
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,500
No, I didn't know you had one.

710
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,400
.He didn't mention her?
.No.

711
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,300
He didn't tell you what she did?

712
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:35,200
He didn't mention her.

713
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,300
Priests are pretty tight.mouthed then?

714
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:40,500
That depends.

715
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,500
.On what?
.The priest.

716
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,000
I mean, what if a person...

717
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,800
...came to you, you know, that was
a murderer or a criminal of some kind...

718
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,500
...and they wanted some kind of help?

719
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,500
Would you have to turn them in?

720
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,300
Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice,
I'd say no.

721
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,100
.You wouldn't?
.No, I wouldn't.

722
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:08,000
But I would try to convince him
to turn himself in.

723
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,500
And, how do you go about
getting an exorcism?

724
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,200
I beg your pardon?

725
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:27,100
If a person's, you know,
possessed by a demon, or something...

726
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,200
...how do they get an exorcism?

727
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,100
First, I'd have to get them
into a time machine...

728
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,200
...and get them back to the 16th century.

729
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,400
I didn't get you.

730
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,200
It just doesn't happen anymore,
Mrs. MacNeil.

731
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,700
Oh, yes? Since when?

732
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:44,500
Since we learned about mental illness,
paranoia, schizophrenia.

733
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,900
All those things they taught me at Harvard.

734
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,700
Mrs. MacNeil,
since the day I joined the Jesuits...

735
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,400
...l've never met one priest
who has performed an exorcism. Not one.

736
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:55,800
Yeah, well...

737
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
...it just so happens
that somebody very close to me...

738
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,700
...is probably possessed.

739
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,900
And needs an exorcist.

740
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,600
Father Karras, it's my little girl.

741
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:14,100
Then that's all the more reason
to forget about exorcism.

742
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:15,500
Why? I don't understand.

743
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,600
To begin with, it could make things worse.

744
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:18,500
How?

745
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,700
Secondly, the Church,
before it approves an exorcism...

746
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,100
...conducts an investigation
to see if it's warranted.

747
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,700
That takes time.

748
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,100
.You could do it yourself.
.No, I couldn't.

749
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,700
I'd need Church approval,
and that's rarely given.

750
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:33,900
Could you see her?

751
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,300
Yes, I could.
I could see her as a psychiatrist..

752
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,500
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest!

753
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:41,500
She's seen every fucking psychiatrist
in the world...

754
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,400
...and they sent me to you!
Are you gonna send me back to them?

755
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,700
Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?

756
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,100
You don't understand..

757
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,200
Can't you help her? Just help her!

758
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,400
It wants no straps.

759
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,000
Hello, Regan.

760
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,900
I'm a friend of your mother's.
I'd like to help you.

761
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,900
You might loosen these straps, then.

762
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:50,300
I'm afraid you might hurt yourself, Regan.

763
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,300
I'm not Regan.

764
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:54,700
I see.

765
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:02,500
Well, then, let's introduce ourselves.
I'm Damien Karras.

766
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,100
And I am the devil.

767
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,100
Now kindly undo these straps.

768
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,400
If you're the devil,
why not make the straps disappear?

769
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,400
That's much too vulgar
a display ofpower, Karras.

770
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,100
Where's Regan?

771
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,200
In here, with us.

772
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:21,600
Show me Regan
and I'll loosen one of the straps.

773
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,800
Could you help an old altar boy, Father?

774
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,900
Your mother is in here with us, Karras.
Would you like to leave a message?

775
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,200
I'll see that she gets it.

776
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,100
If that's true...

777
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,200
...then you must know
my mother's maiden name.

778
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,300
What is it?

779
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,100
What is it?

780
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,600
Thank you.

781
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:56,000
Look, I'm only against the possibility
of doing her more harm than good.

782
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,700
Nothing you could do
could make it any worse.

783
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:01,900
I can't do it.

784
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,300
I need evidence that the Church
would accept as signs of possession.

785
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,200
Like what?

786
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:09,600
Her speaking in a language
she's never known or studied.

787
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:10,800
What else?

788
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,700
I don't know. I'd have to look it up.

789
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,600
I thought you were supposed
to be an expert.

790
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,300
There are no experts.

791
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:24,100
You probably know as much
about possession as most priests.

792
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,300
Your daughter doesn't say she's a demon.

793
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,200
She says she's the devil himself.

794
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,700
If you've seen as many psychotics
as I have, you'd realize...

795
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,600
...that's the same as saying
you're Napoleon Bonaparte.

796
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:40,400
You asked me what I think
is best for your daughter.

797
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:44,800
Six months under observation...

798
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,300
...in the best hospital you can find.

799
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,700
You show me Regan's double...

800
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:55,500
...same face, same voice, everything...

801
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,100
...and I'd know it wasn't Regan.

802
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,400
I'd know in my gut.

803
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:05,000
I'm telling you that that thing upstairs
isn't my daughter.

804
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,700
I want you to tell me
that you know for a fact...

805
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,800
...there's nothing wrong with my daughter
except in her mind!

806
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,900
Tell me you know for a fact
that an exorcism wouldn't do any good!

807
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,300
You tell me that!

808
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,800
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?

809
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:32,800
No.

810
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,700
Did you know my mother died recently?

811
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:37,100
Yes, I did. I'm very sorry.

812
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,200
Is Regan aware of it?

813
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,700
Not at all.

814
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,300
Why do you ask?

815
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:49,100
It's not important. Good night.

816
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,900
"He broke the bread,
and gave it to his disciples and said:

817
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,300
"'Take this, all of you, and eat it.

818
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,800
"'For this is my body.'

819
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,500
"When the supper was ended,
he took the cup.

820
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:42,300
"Again he gave you thanks and praise.

821
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:46,500
"He gave the cup to his disciples and said:
'Take this...

822
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,100
"'...all of you, and drink from it.

823
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,500
"'This is the cup of my blood.

824
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:00,200
"'The blood of the new and everlasting
Covenant, the mystery of faith."'

825
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:04,100
What an excellent day for an exorcism.

826
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,400
You'd like that?

827
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,900
Intensely.

828
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,300
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?

829
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,300
It would bring us together.

830
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,200
You and Regan?

831
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:18,700
You and us.

832
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:31,000
Did you do that?

833
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,300
Do it again.

834
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,400
In time.

835
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,500
No, now.

836
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,200
In time.

837
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,300
Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?

838
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,500
You speak Latin?

839
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,200
Ego te absolvo.

840
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,600
Quod nomen mihi est?

841
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:57,400
Bonjour!

842
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:58,900
Quod nomen mihi est?

843
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:00,600
La plume de ma tante.

844
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,400
How long are you planning
to stay in Regan?

845
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,300
Until she rots
and lies stinking in the earth.

846
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,100
What's that?

847
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,000
Holy water.

848
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,200
You keep it away!

849
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,500
It burns!

850
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,500
Oh, it burns!

851
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,000
Who are you?

852
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:00,300
You know, I'm like in seclusion.

853
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,400
No, I'm just exhausted from work.

854
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:12,900
She's, she's all right.

855
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,600
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

856
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,000
Okay, I'll talk to you.
I'll call as soon as it's over, all right?

857
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:33,200
No, I just, I'm going through something
and I just have to....

858
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,100
No, no....

859
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,900
There's nothing.

860
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:40,900
Hey, thanks a lot.

861
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,200
.Want a drink?
.Please.

862
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,700
What do you drink?

863
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,200
Scotch.

864
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,000
Ice and water.

865
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:14,400
No ice. I'll get some from the kitchen.

866
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:17,000
That's all right. I'll take it straight.
Please sit.

867
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,800
Where's her father?

868
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,100
In Europe.

869
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,400
.Have you told him what's happening?
.No.

870
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,000
Well, I think you should.

871
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,200
I told Regan that was holy water.

872
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:48,900
I sprinkled it on her
and she reacted very violently.

873
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:52,800
It's tap water.

874
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:54,200
What's the difference?

875
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,900
Holy water is blessed. And that doesn't
help support a case for possession.

876
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:11,700
She killed Burke Dennings.

877
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:13,500
What?

878
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:18,700
She killed Burke Dennings.

879
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:22,300
She pushed him out her window.

880
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:35,500
No one.

881
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:37,600
Who are you?

882
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:38,700
No one!

883
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:43,000
It's a language, all right. It's English.

884
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:45,300
What do you mean?

885
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,300
It's English in reverse. Listen.

886
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:49,700
Give us time.

887
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:51,700
Let her die.

888
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,200
I am no one. I am no one.

889
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,700
Fear the priest.

890
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:01,900
Fear the priest.

891
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:05,900
Merrin!

892
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,900
I am no one.

893
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,000
Merrin! Fear the priest!

894
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,300
Merrin!

895
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,700
Yeah?

896
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:32,900
I'll be right there.

897
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:52,500
I don't want Chris to see this.

898
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,100
What's wrong? What is it?

899
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:03,000
You're convinced that it's genuine?

900
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:05,100
I don't know.

901
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,800
No, not really, I suppose.

902
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,200
But I have made...

903
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:15,000
...a prudent judgement that it meets
the conditions set down in The Ritual.

904
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:17,300
You would want to do
the exorcism yourself?.

905
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:20,100
Yes.

906
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:26,300
It might be best to have a man
with experience.

907
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,900
Someone who's spent time
in the foreign missions.

908
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:31,600
I understand, Your Excellency.

909
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,700
Let's see who's around.

910
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:36,100
In the meantime,
I'll call you as soon as I know.

911
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:38,900
Thank you, Your Excellency.

912
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,800
Well, he does know the background.

913
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:45,000
I doubt there's any danger
in just having him assist.

914
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,800
There should be
a psychiatrist present, anyway.

915
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,000
What about the exorcist?

916
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:51,500
Have you any ideas?

917
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,300
How about Lankester Merrin?

918
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,500
I had a notion he was in lraq.

919
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,700
I read he was working
on a dig near Nineveh.

920
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:02,200
You're right, but he's finished.

921
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:05,300
He came back three or four months ago.
He's at Woodstock now.

922
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:07,700
What's he doing there, teaching?

923
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:09,800
He's working on another book.

924
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:13,400
Don't you think he's too old, Tom?
How's his health?

925
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:17,400
He must be all right.
He's still running around digging up tombs.

926
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,700
.Besides, he's had experience.
.I didn't know that.

927
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Ten, 12 years ago, I think, in Africa.

928
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:29,000
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
I heard it damn near killed him.

929
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,700
Father?

930
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,700
.You're Mrs. MacNeil?
.Yes.

931
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:42,100
I'm Father Merrin.

932
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,300
Come in.

933
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:44,700
Thank you.

934
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:48,300
.Is Father Karras here?
.Yes. He's here already.

935
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,300
It's an honor to meet you, Father.

936
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:00,100
.Are you very tired?
.No.

937
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:04,400
I'd like you to go quickly
across to the Residence...

938
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:06,700
...and gather up a cassock for myself...

939
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:10,100
...two surplices, a purple stole,
and some holy water...

940
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:11,500
...and...

941
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,700
...your copy of The Roman Ritual.
The large one.

942
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:16,800
I believe we should begin.

943
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,900
Do you want to hear the background
of the case first, Father?

944
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,000
Why?

945
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:26,100
Especially important is the warning
to avoid conversations with the demon.

946
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:31,800
We may ask what is relevant,
but anything beyond that is dangerous.

947
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,000
He's a liar. The demon is a liar.

948
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,100
He will lie to confuse us.

949
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:41,000
But he will also mix lies with the truth...

950
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,500
...to attack us.

951
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,600
The attack is psychological, Damien.

952
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:49,100
And powerful.

953
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:51,600
So don't listen.

954
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:54,100
Remember that. Do not listen!

955
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,100
It might be helpful
if I gave you some background...

956
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,900
...on the different personalities
Regan has manifested.

957
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,100
So far, I'd say there seem to be three.

958
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,800
.She's convinced that..
.There is only one.

959
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:06,300
Stick your cock up her ass,
you mother.fucking worthless cock sucker!

960
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,500
