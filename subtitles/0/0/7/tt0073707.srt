00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:33,550
- The Thakur...?
- Welcome, sir. This way...

3
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,127
I knew it the moment I received
your letter, Thakur...

4
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:12,687
...that you wished to meet me.

5
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:14,526
I took the first available train.

6
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:18,125
I'm putting you to
some trouble, jailer.

7
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,844
Not at all, sir. Just name it...
whatever it be.

8
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:26,524
- I need two men.
- Two?

9
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:42,798
Do you recognize them?

10
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:47,516
There's hardly a prison where
they have not been held, Thakur.

11
00:04:47,516 --> 00:04:50,796
This is Veeru.
...and this is Jai.

12
00:04:50,796 --> 00:04:55,075
They're crooks, both of them.
Thieves of the first order.

13
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:59,394
I know.

14
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:04,352
They're just what I need
for the assignment at hand.

15
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:09,110
I can't say what assignment
you have in mind, Thakur.

16
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,468
But I can surely tell you that
they're good for nothing.

17
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:15,829
That's not true, jailer.

18
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:20,787
For all their vices, they
have some virtues, too.

19
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:25,785
A fake coin is a fake, sir.
Whichever way you look at it.

20
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:29,904
That is perhaps the difference
between man and coin.

21
00:05:29,904 --> 00:05:34,703
I clearly remember what
happened two years ago.

22
00:05:35,704 --> 00:05:40,541
I had arrested both of them
in district Jamalpur.

23
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:45,101
We had to reach the police station
at village Tamli by dusk.

24
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:48,300
Since no other arrangements
could be made...

25
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,418
...we took a goods-train.

26
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:56,258
I had two constables with me.
And there were these crooks...

27
00:05:56,977 --> 00:06:00,496
...Jaidev and Veeru;
chained and handcuffed.

28
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:03,934
Could you have been at the Daulatpur
police station earlier, sir?

29
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:07,214
Yes, I was. Why did you ask?

30
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:09,173
I remember now!

31
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:13,132
I've been wondering where I've seen
you, ever since you've caught us.

32
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:16,131
Remember Lalji's shop? The
provision store which we robbed?

33
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:21,570
- Do you remember?
- The provision store? No...

34
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,208
Don't you? Jai...

35
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,208
Remember, we were held at
the Daulatpur police station?

36
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:30,447
- Daulatpur?
- Yes, don't you remember?

37
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:34,046
- When was that?
- We had robbed the grocer...

38
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:38,405
He was the officer then...
Don't you recognize him?

39
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:43,003
All police officers
look the same to me.

40
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:47,003
I can't help it, you know...
He's always talking nonsense.

41
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,561
Since when have the two of you
been in this racket?

42
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:56,839
You could say, we stood our own
two feet, the moment we could!

43
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,878
But why must you do all this?

44
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:02,758
The reason what you're a cop for...
we into it for the money.

45
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:07,196
Not true. I'm not a police officer
just for the money.

46
00:07:07,196 --> 00:07:11,315
I have enough of family land
to keep us going.

47
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:16,193
But perhaps I'm fond of the
dangers involved in the game.

48
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:19,033
We face dangers everyday, too.

49
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:23,272
There's a difference. I take on
dangers to protect the law.

50
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:27,270
And you do it to
break the law.

51
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,230
You need to be a brave man,
in both the cases.

52
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,549
Oh sure! You do need courage.

53
00:07:33,549 --> 00:07:36,148
I see.

54
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:38,708
You guys think you're
very brave, don't you?

55
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,907
You will see when
the need arises, Inspector.

56
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:44,626
We'd at least take on
15 or 20 guys.

57
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:47,065
I haven't exaggerated it,
have I?

58
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:51,704
- Now that you've already said it...
- We deal with it!

59
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:03,740
Bandits!

60
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:20,615
Well, Inspector?
Want to try out our guts?

61
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:29,492
There's still time, Inspector.
Give it a thought!

62
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:41,370
Don't you try to escape.

63
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:21,358
Stop the engine, driver!

64
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:30,915
Let's move ahead!
As fast as you can!

65
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:57,747
Charge ahead!

66
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:38,661
Give me a swig! Quick!

67
00:14:35,987 --> 00:14:39,745
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right...

68
00:15:07,017 --> 00:15:10,976
He dares mess with Veeru!

69
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:18,614
They've fled, the swines!

70
00:15:18,614 --> 00:15:21,533
Let's go... Come on!

71
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:27,571
I had warned you
not to escape...

72
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,330
What do you think?

73
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,048
We can run away.

74
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:41,167
Leaving him in this state?

75
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:44,567
He's going to die, if we
leave him in this condition.

76
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,406
Suppose we take him
to the hospital...

77
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:49,806
...we get sent away
for four or six months.

78
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:53,724
- So what do you suggest?
- What do you think?

79
00:15:53,925 --> 00:15:56,403
Get it out.

80
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:04,161
If it's Heads, we go to the hospital;
if it's Tails, we escape.

81
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,117
They are criminals, no doubt.
But they're terribly brave.

82
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:21,516
They're dangerous, because
they know how to fight back.

83
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:26,314
They're bad... but they're human.

84
00:16:26,314 --> 00:16:30,794
Could you find these
guys for me, jailer?

85
00:16:31,873 --> 00:16:36,392
We'll easily find them, if they
are presently in some prison.

86
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:41,750
But if they're free, it's
difficult to find such people.

87
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:59,480
Soorma Bhopali! You're pulling
out more of the firewood.

88
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,360
Naturally. You don't expect me
to put some more, do you?

89
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,239
The scale says it's enough...
and you insist on more.

90
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:09,717
Just take the wood and get going.
Give me the money...

91
00:23:09,717 --> 00:23:11,117
Here's a 2-Rupee bill.

92
00:23:11,117 --> 00:23:15,876
I can see that, but is it genuine?
Okay, it is.

93
00:23:15,876 --> 00:23:19,075
So then, good-bye.

94
00:23:19,075 --> 00:23:23,274
- Won't you return my money?
- Money? What money do you want?

95
00:23:23,674 --> 00:23:26,633
- That's a two-Rupee bill!
- The wood is worth 2 Rupees too!

96
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:28,473
Just this much of wood
for two Rupees?!

97
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:32,032
Were you out to buy the whole forest
for two bucks then?

98
00:23:32,032 --> 00:23:35,990
Now look; I've had enough!
Just get going.

99
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,829
I'm not Soorma Bhopali for nothing!
Okay?

100
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:43,867
Get lost...
I wonder where they come from!

101
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:47,387
He says the wood is too little!
Wants the forest then, does he?!

102
00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:50,585
They always come early every
morning to spoil my day!

103
00:23:50,585 --> 00:23:55,744
There, Chand! You're at your
cursed poetry again!

104
00:23:56,025 --> 00:23:59,264
Go and check if they're unloaded
the stuff from the truck yet!

105
00:23:59,264 --> 00:24:02,583
Well! Well! Are you guys
watching a drama here?

106
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:06,780
This is no travelers' bungalow...
who are you guys?

107
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:12,620
God Almighty! It's you!

108
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,458
How are you, Soorma Bhopali?

109
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,778
I'm fine, thank you!

110
00:24:17,778 --> 00:24:21,137
But what are you guys up to?!

111
00:24:21,137 --> 00:24:22,576
Come here!

112
00:24:22,576 --> 00:24:27,095
The police have declared a reward
of 2000 Rupees for your arrest.

113
00:24:27,535 --> 00:24:32,134
If someone watches us together,
I'll land in trouble, too!

114
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:34,253
So please get going!

115
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:37,412
Know what, Soorma Bhopali?
We want to go to prison.

116
00:24:37,412 --> 00:24:40,092
I hope God fulfills your wish!

117
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:43,730
Had this been Bhopal, I'd have had
you locked up in just two minutes!

118
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:47,529
I'm not Soorma Bhopali for
nothing, you know!

119
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:48,889
But why would anyone
need me here?

120
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:52,088
A warrant's out in
your name in any case!

121
00:24:52,088 --> 00:24:56,007
But we want you to
have us arrested.

122
00:24:56,007 --> 00:24:57,766
What are you talking about?!

123
00:24:57,766 --> 00:25:01,726
There's a reward of 2000 Rupees
which you will get.

124
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:07,324
Give us half the money, when
we're released from prison.

125
00:25:08,203 --> 00:25:10,843
- Do you get it?
- What are you saying!

126
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:15,081
Have some betel-leaf;
Go on... it's great!

127
00:25:25,078 --> 00:25:27,198
Since when have they started
having a parade here?

128
00:25:27,198 --> 00:25:30,918
You've just arrived, sonny boy.
You'll get to know soon.

129
00:25:30,918 --> 00:25:33,196
This new jailer is a nasty one!

130
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:37,715
- A nasty jailer, he says.
- There he is.

131
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:59,788
Attention, I say!

132
00:26:00,788 --> 00:26:04,387
But they're already
at attention, sir.

133
00:26:06,027 --> 00:26:09,385
I know that.

134
00:26:09,385 --> 00:26:13,744
Prisoners!
This is a warning for you!

135
00:26:13,744 --> 00:26:17,183
Everything that went unchecked
before my arrival here...

136
00:26:17,183 --> 00:26:20,822
...will no longer be tolerated!

137
00:26:21,422 --> 00:26:27,340
I've been a jailer since
the British days!

138
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,379
I don't belong to the breed
of jailers...

139
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:34,539
...who waste time, trying to
reform the prisoners!

140
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:39,256
I know it for a fact!
You guys can't be reformed!

141
00:26:39,816 --> 00:26:44,496
How can you ever change,
when I have not changed?

142
00:26:48,454 --> 00:26:53,614
I know, my words don't
go down well with you.

143
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:57,811
Which is why I am transferred
from every place I work in.

144
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:05,410
But despite all my transfers...
I have not changed!

145
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:09,408
So you'd better remember!

146
00:27:09,408 --> 00:27:14,687
Don't think I am not informed
of all that you guys are up to!

147
00:27:14,687 --> 00:27:19,445
I have spies everywhere
in the prison.

148
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:24,445
I get a report of every moment.

149
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:26,883
Not even a bird could
flap its wings here...

150
00:27:26,883 --> 00:27:29,602
...without my consent!

151
00:27:29,602 --> 00:27:32,961
- What the hell was that?!
- A bird... a pigeon, sir!

152
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:35,881
What's that in my eyes...
never mind!

153
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:41,119
This will do for today!
You may leave now.

154
00:27:44,158 --> 00:27:46,878
Let's go!

155
00:27:47,837 --> 00:27:50,316
Strange guy!

156
00:27:50,316 --> 00:27:53,275
Who could be the jailer's spy?

157
00:27:53,275 --> 00:27:56,795
I know that.
It's the barber, Hariram.

158
00:27:56,795 --> 00:27:59,514
He's very thick with the jailer.
The swine!

159
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:04,153
Hariram, the barber?

160
00:28:08,951 --> 00:28:12,710
Go ahead and shave
my moustache, Hariram.

161
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:16,109
It has all been arranged!

162
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:18,589
We get cracking tomorrow.

163
00:28:18,589 --> 00:28:23,227
How many days will it take
to make the tunnel?

164
00:28:23,227 --> 00:28:25,866
You've cut my face!

165
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:30,584
The tunnel? It should be
ready in about a week.

166
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,664
Where are we going to
dig the tunnel from?

167
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,903
It's from Barrack No. 9.

168
00:28:36,903 --> 00:28:39,942
I hope the jailer
doesn't get to know!

169
00:28:39,942 --> 00:28:44,340
No one will hear of it!

170
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:50,459
Let's go!

171
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:53,418
There. I'm through.

172
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:02,935
Yes, Hariram?
What news do you bring?

173
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:07,934
Be careful, sir. They're digging
a tunnel in the jail.

174
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:12,612
Oh, well! A tunnel in my jail...

175
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:15,452
What was that? A tunnel
in my jail?!

176
00:29:15,452 --> 00:29:17,971
Yes, sir. The prisoners are
making a tunnel in the jail.

177
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:21,210
I've been a jailer since
the days of the British!

178
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:27,049
A tunnel in my jail, eh?

179
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:54,881
So this is where the
tunnel is being dug!

180
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:56,800
This is wonderful!

181
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,599
But you guys seem to have
forgotten that my spies...

182
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:05,516
...are spread out in
every part of the prison.

183
00:30:05,516 --> 00:30:08,717
And what is this?

184
00:30:09,236 --> 00:30:16,033
So this is the tool with which
you will dig the tunnel!

185
00:30:20,393 --> 00:30:27,791
I'm a jailer... from
the British days!

186
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,429
Here he comes!

187
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:38,708
- Is it all arranged then?
- Yes.

188
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:42,027
We won't miss out this time!

189
00:30:42,027 --> 00:30:44,586
A pistol has arrived
in the prison!

190
00:30:44,586 --> 00:30:47,266
Has the pistol arrived?!

191
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:55,224
In just a couple of days,
the jailer and his spies...

192
00:31:01,221 --> 00:31:04,900
A pistol in my prison, eh?

193
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,858
A pistol in my prison,
did you say?!

194
00:31:07,858 --> 00:31:09,819
- A revolt?!
- That's right.

195
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:11,539
- Streams of blood?!
- Exactly.

196
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:14,218
Guards!

197
00:31:20,536 --> 00:31:23,015
Halt!

198
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:25,775
Search every nook and corner
of the jail!

199
00:31:25,775 --> 00:31:28,452
Half of you go in that direction.

200
00:31:28,452 --> 00:31:32,772
Half of you go there.

201
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:39,450
The rest of you guys...
come with me!

202
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:48,310
Here's the pistol!

203
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:52,590
Move an inch, and...

204
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:54,468
Guards!

205
00:32:54,468 --> 00:32:57,268
They've left.

206
00:32:57,907 --> 00:33:01,066
- Let's go to your office.
- How can I?

207
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:03,107
You have asked me not to move!

208
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:07,145
The first order stands cancelled.
Let's go.

209
00:33:16,382 --> 00:33:20,500
Is the jailer of the British days
so scared?

210
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,979
No!

211
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:29,339
Come and see us off
at the gate first!

212
00:33:43,174 --> 00:33:47,813
Have the gate opened.

213
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:57,010
Open the gate.

214
00:34:04,968 --> 00:34:08,767
Here's the key.

215
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:13,565
And here's the "pistol"!

216
00:34:16,645 --> 00:34:19,283
The two of them must have
tried to run away, isn't it?

217
00:34:19,283 --> 00:34:22,323
Tried to run away?
That's an understatement!

218
00:34:22,323 --> 00:34:24,162
They put their lives
into it!

219
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,762
But I wasn't about
to let them go!

220
00:34:26,762 --> 00:34:29,002
As I held one of them...

221
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:31,360
...the other tried to escape.

222
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,238
I dragged him back and asked,
"Where to, feller?"

223
00:34:35,238 --> 00:34:39,238
With two stinging slaps, I ordered
them to the police station!

224
00:34:39,238 --> 00:34:41,797
That was it! They were
begging at my feet!

225
00:34:41,797 --> 00:34:43,996
Did Veeru and Jai really
beg at your feet?

226
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:45,475
They're dangerous criminals!

227
00:34:45,475 --> 00:34:48,156
They're criminals, all right!

228
00:34:48,156 --> 00:34:52,274
But I'm not called Soorma
Bhopali for nothing!

229
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:56,154
You can imagine!
They wept at my feet!

230
00:34:56,154 --> 00:34:59,512
And begged for forgiveness;
I'd have forgiven them, too!

231
00:34:59,512 --> 00:35:03,791
But I was furious that they had
dared to trespass my territory!

232
00:35:04,471 --> 00:35:06,711
- What happened next?
- What else?!

233
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:08,710
You know I carry a stick!

234
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,269
It was days since I had used it.
So I got down to brass-tracks...

235
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:16,226
...and I really thrashed them!
I gave them a terrible beating!

236
00:35:16,226 --> 00:35:18,427
- What happened next?
- What would have happened?

237
00:35:18,427 --> 00:35:23,385
I held them by their collars
and said...

238
00:35:23,385 --> 00:35:26,103
- What did you say?
- What did I?!

239
00:35:26,103 --> 00:35:29,224
What did I say?!
Yes, I remember...

240
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:32,303
I said, " Do let me know if there is
something more I can do for you"

241
00:35:32,303 --> 00:35:35,941
Well, guys... have you
nothing better to do?

242
00:35:35,941 --> 00:35:39,461
You plunk yourselves here and
compel me to concoct falsehoods!

243
00:35:39,461 --> 00:35:43,699
Go and attend to your work!
Go on... lazy bums!

244
00:35:43,899 --> 00:35:48,379
Well... I was only kidding.

245
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:52,457
But you guys have been released
pretty quickly, haven't you?

246
00:35:52,457 --> 00:35:57,576
My word! The stint at the prison
seems to have been good for you!

247
00:35:58,216 --> 00:36:02,174
We are here to collect
our thousand Rupees.

248
00:36:02,174 --> 00:36:05,892
- A thousand rupees?
- That's right. A thousand bucks.

249
00:36:05,892 --> 00:36:07,532
I see!

250
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:11,731
I got the money the very next day
of your arrest!

251
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:16,529
Since that day, the money has been
lying in an envelope in my pocket!

252
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:20,169
Check it out...
it's a thousand bucks!

253
00:36:20,169 --> 00:36:24,127
Well, Soorma... see you again.

254
00:36:34,364 --> 00:36:36,443
It's these chaps I've
been looking for.

255
00:36:36,443 --> 00:36:39,564
When does their prison term
come to an end?

256
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,242
On the 18th of the next month.

257
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:51,960
Could I have a beedi, guard?

258
00:37:06,676 --> 00:37:11,114
Well, Inspector? Who have you
brought to the prison today?

259
00:37:11,114 --> 00:37:14,993
I'm not an Inspector anymore.
I'm just Thakur Baldev Singh.

260
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:20,191
Why? Have you gotten over your
fondness of playing with dangers?

261
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:25,270
If your bravery really makes
you so arrogant...

262
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:30,188
...will you accept
an assignment from me?

263
00:37:30,188 --> 00:37:32,988
We accept assignments
only for money.

264
00:37:32,988 --> 00:37:36,147
How much do you want?

265
00:37:39,746 --> 00:37:41,986
What's the job?

266
00:37:41,986 --> 00:37:45,543
Why must you worry about that,
if you're really brave?

267
00:37:45,543 --> 00:37:49,382
Name the price.
And you will get it.

268
00:37:49,382 --> 00:37:53,501
Provided you do what
I want you to do.

269
00:37:53,862 --> 00:37:57,661
Gabbar Singh?!
The notorious bandit?!

270
00:37:57,661 --> 00:38:00,020
Yes. He's the one.

271
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,859
The police are even said to have
placed a reward on his head.

272
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:07,497
50,000 Rupees... for capturing him
dead or alive.

273
00:38:07,497 --> 00:38:12,577
You've got to capture the
bandit for me... alive.

274
00:38:12,577 --> 00:38:16,615
You want us to get Gabbar Singh...
that too, alive and kicking!

275
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:20,134
Gabbar Singh is no sheep-kid
we could run and catch, Thakur!

276
00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:23,373
I know it's a difficult task.

277
00:38:23,373 --> 00:38:27,252
But no one pays so much
for something easy.

278
00:38:27,252 --> 00:38:31,450
Let's suppose we risk our lives and
somehow manage to capture him.

279
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:35,170
Do you want us to hand him over
to you for just 20,000 Rupees?

280
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,609
So you can make a cool
50,000 Rupees, for nothing?

281
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:40,248
The reward from the police
will go to you, too.

282
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:43,687
I only want Gabbar.

283
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:46,766
Is it an old feud?

284
00:38:46,766 --> 00:38:52,684
That's none of your business.

285
00:38:54,724 --> 00:38:57,324
May I ask you another
question then?

286
00:38:57,324 --> 00:39:01,202
You know we're criminals, too.

287
00:39:01,202 --> 00:39:05,481
Why did you choose us
to track down the bandit?

288
00:39:05,481 --> 00:39:11,159
Only because iron
shall deal with iron.

289
00:39:15,598 --> 00:39:17,437
That's 5,000 Rupees.

290
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:20,556
You will get 5,000 more upon
your arrival in Ramgarh.

291
00:39:20,556 --> 00:39:24,436
The rest after you have
accomplished the mission.

292
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:32,713
What do you suggest?

293
00:39:39,592 --> 00:39:44,149
"Heads" - we go.

294
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:05,983
Well, gentlemen?
Where will you go?

295
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:10,542
Belapur, Rampur, Ramgarh...
where do you want to go?

296
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:14,141
Have you never seen
a horse-cart before?

297
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:15,821
This is a village, sir.

298
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:19,739
You can't find cars here in
which you can speed away.

299
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:21,898
Basanti's "tonga" is all
you will find around here.

300
00:40:21,898 --> 00:40:25,098
Now look; I'm not in the habit
of talking unnecessarily.

301
00:40:25,098 --> 00:40:26,618
- Say so, if you wish to go...
- Well, we do wish...

302
00:40:26,618 --> 00:40:31,456
It's okay, if you don't wish to go!
You won't be my enemies!

303
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,935
I thought you'd need a tonga
and happened to ask you.

304
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:37,334
But you don't have to be
my passengers, you know.

305
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,374
It's your own free will!

306
00:40:39,374 --> 00:40:43,092
This is Basanti's tonga, not
the field of the landlord...

307
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:45,052
...which you will have to till,
even if you don't want to!

308
00:40:45,052 --> 00:40:49,130
- This is just like...
- Let's go! We wish to go!

309
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:51,650
- Let's go!
- Sure. When have I refused?

310
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:55,009
Now look; I'm not a chatter-box.

311
00:40:55,009 --> 00:40:57,488
So I'd better tell you in advance.

312
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:00,447
A ride to Belapur costs 2 Rupees
and one to Rampur costs 1.5 Rupee.

313
00:41:00,447 --> 00:41:03,567
Don't haggle, please!
What Basanti says is final!

314
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:05,806
- Okay, but we...
- I know what you will say!

315
00:41:05,806 --> 00:41:09,925
Just why I charge 2 Rupees for
Belapur and 1.50 for Ramgarh?

316
00:41:10,405 --> 00:41:13,164
You'd better ask which village
this tonga belongs to. Go on.

317
00:41:13,164 --> 00:41:17,443
- Well, where does it belong?
- It belongs to Ramgarh!

318
00:41:17,443 --> 00:41:20,522
I see! So it belongs
to Ramgarh! Now I know!

319
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:23,160
Actually, there is this thing
worth considering.

320
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,640
When I make a trip to Belapur,
I actually make two trips.

321
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,760
To Belapur and back to Ramgarh.

322
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,719
But should I go to Ramgarh,
it's like going home.

323
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:37,237
Where would you like to go?

324
00:41:37,237 --> 00:41:39,917
Actually, we'd like
to go to Ramgarh, too.

325
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:42,116
Sure! When have I refused?

326
00:41:42,116 --> 00:41:46,234
But you will have to tell me
whose house you're going to.

327
00:41:46,234 --> 00:41:48,354
So Basanti can take you
to that house.

328
00:41:48,354 --> 00:41:51,713
If I'm not told where
you've got to go...

329
00:41:51,713 --> 00:41:53,312
...how will I stop the tonga?

330
00:41:53,312 --> 00:41:56,511
How will the tonga stop
if I don't stop it?

331
00:41:56,511 --> 00:42:01,030
Who holds the reins?
I do!

332
00:42:01,471 --> 00:42:03,270
And if I...

333
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,748
We've got to go to Thakur
Baldev Singh's place.

334
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:09,828
Sure! Let's go!
When did I refuse?

335
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:11,547
You could said as much!

336
00:42:11,547 --> 00:42:14,667
Let's go, Dhanno!

337
00:42:21,304 --> 00:42:25,783
So you see, I had already
lost my parents.

338
00:42:25,783 --> 00:42:29,782
And who had to fend for my aunt
and ply the tonga?

339
00:42:30,102 --> 00:42:31,581
Me, of course.

340
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:36,340
People ask how a girl like me
can go around plying a tonga.

341
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:39,538
I have an answer ready
for them.

342
00:42:39,538 --> 00:42:42,578
Dhanno is a mare; and she
can still draw the cart.

343
00:42:42,578 --> 00:42:45,658
So why not Basanti?
Am I right?

344
00:42:45,658 --> 00:42:50,576
So what's wrong? City girls drive
cars... no one says anything to them.

345
00:42:50,576 --> 00:42:54,735
You're a wise man, although
you're from the city.

346
00:42:54,735 --> 00:42:57,974
- What is your name?
- Veeru.

347
00:42:57,974 --> 00:43:00,493
You haven't yet asked me
my name, have you?

348
00:43:00,493 --> 00:43:02,692
What is your name, Basanti?

349
00:43:02,692 --> 00:43:05,971
Oh, shut up! You're always
talking nonsense!

350
00:43:05,971 --> 00:43:08,490
I wasn't talking to you, you know.

351
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:12,210
But since you have asked me,
let me tell you...

352
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,689
...my name is Basanti.

353
00:43:13,689 --> 00:43:16,169
That's the first time
I've heard the name.

354
00:43:16,169 --> 00:43:19,966
Basanti! What a lovely name!

355
00:43:19,966 --> 00:43:23,526
There's a story
behind my name, too.

356
00:43:23,526 --> 00:43:25,725
Really? Do tell me...!

357
00:43:25,725 --> 00:43:28,804
When I was a little girl...

358
00:43:28,804 --> 00:43:33,084
...a distant relative said...

359
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:51,118
That's it, Dhanno! Halt!

360
00:43:51,118 --> 00:43:53,118
This is the Thakur's mansion.

361
00:43:53,118 --> 00:43:57,316
Strange! Talking to you guys,
I didn't even realize the distance.

362
00:43:57,796 --> 00:44:00,155
That's right.
We are very talkative.

363
00:44:00,155 --> 00:44:03,475
Here's the 1.50 Rupee
we had settled for.

364
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:05,914
You're a nice man. I shouldn't be
accepting the money from you.

365
00:44:05,914 --> 00:44:09,433
But what will the horse eat,
if it befriends its food?

366
00:44:09,433 --> 00:44:14,352
- So I will accept the money.
- That's very kind of you.

367
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:18,789
Let's go, Dhanno!

368
00:44:24,308 --> 00:44:28,628
Wow! She talks so well!

369
00:44:28,628 --> 00:44:31,306
She talks too much!

370
00:44:31,306 --> 00:44:35,586
Let's go. You don't have to
score with every girl you meet.

371
00:44:36,105 --> 00:44:38,225
Come on!

372
00:44:38,225 --> 00:44:40,984
Welcome.

373
00:44:43,184 --> 00:44:46,382
This way, please.

374
00:44:49,142 --> 00:44:50,740
Greetings, Thakur.

375
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,100
You had no problems
getting here, I hope?

376
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,540
Well, not much.

377
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,059
Come in.

378
00:44:59,378 --> 00:45:03,337
Had you dropped a letter, I'd have
sent someone to receive you.

379
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:06,256
Your stay has been arranged.

380
00:45:06,256 --> 00:45:09,895
Just let me know, if there
is anything you need.

381
00:45:18,693 --> 00:45:23,651
I had promised to pay you 5000
rupees on your arrival here.

382
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:30,169
You remember your
assignment, don't you?

383
00:45:30,169 --> 00:45:32,728
I want Gabbar.

384
00:45:32,728 --> 00:45:35,168
- I want him alive.
- Of course, remember.

385
00:45:35,168 --> 00:45:39,127
You want Gabbar...
captured alive.

386
00:45:40,127 --> 00:45:42,246
You will have him.

387
00:45:42,246 --> 00:45:45,445
Go and take some rest.
You must be tired.

388
00:45:45,445 --> 00:45:47,765
We'll discuss the rest later.

389
00:45:47,765 --> 00:45:50,244
Follow me.

390
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,478
Please go ahead.
I'll go and fetch the keys.

391
00:46:10,438 --> 00:46:14,716
That safe was
stuffed with riches!

392
00:46:16,237 --> 00:46:19,156
Folks in this village
seem to wear a lot of gold.

393
00:46:19,156 --> 00:46:22,075
So what do you say?

394
00:46:42,828 --> 00:46:48,547
Quite a big house...
and beautiful, too.

395
00:46:49,947 --> 00:46:54,305
- Who else stays in there?
- Your keys.

396
00:46:54,665 --> 00:46:56,264
That is your quarters.

397
00:46:56,264 --> 00:46:59,984
Do call me over, should
you need something.

398
00:47:02,502 --> 00:47:06,781
I can't quite figure this out.

399
00:47:06,781 --> 00:47:10,661
Why must we bother, Jai?
The Thakur has paid us 10,000.

400
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:15,299
Let's clean out his safe tonight
and get away. What say?

401
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,819
Very well.

402
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:21,538
Let's sleep now, if we're going
to keep awake tonight.

403
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:56,151
Thakur! These guys were...

404
00:48:56,151 --> 00:48:58,350
They're my men.

405
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,868
Then why did they attack us?

406
00:49:00,868 --> 00:49:05,467
I wanted to see if you still
possess the courage and strength.

407
00:49:05,947 --> 00:49:12,145
Or whether time has rendered
your might, impotent.

408
00:49:12,425 --> 00:49:15,664
So? What did you see?

409
00:49:15,664 --> 00:49:22,702
I see that I have made no mistake
in having you brought here.

410
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:31,459
There is one mistake you
have made, Thakur!

411
00:50:52,236 --> 00:50:54,876
Here's the key to the safe.

412
00:50:54,876 --> 00:51:00,033
The safe has some ornaments
which are of no use to me.

413
00:51:01,153 --> 00:51:05,713
A widow will never need them again.

414
00:51:05,713 --> 00:51:10,951
It has some money, too.
You can take that away.

415
00:51:10,951 --> 00:51:15,990
I'm glad, it will at least break
the Thakur's false hopes.

416
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:19,908
Hopes, that he has pinned on you.

417
00:51:30,464 --> 00:51:33,743
Excuse me.

418
00:51:53,138 --> 00:51:58,177
That which happened last night
will not happen again.

419
00:52:15,172 --> 00:52:17,931
Here... have some more!

420
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:20,091
You've eaten enough
to be big and strong!

421
00:52:20,091 --> 00:52:24,290
But when we make to trip to Belapur,
you sure do put on airs!

422
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:27,929
- Go ahead and eat...!
- Basanti...!

423
00:52:27,929 --> 00:52:31,168
I'm here, feeding
this donkey, auntie!

424
00:52:31,168 --> 00:52:33,926
Now watch her take off!

425
00:52:33,926 --> 00:52:38,206
Listen, lady!
You can roam around all day!

426
00:52:38,566 --> 00:52:41,325
But you wouldn't do
a simple chore for me!

427
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,524
There she is! Ranting as usual!

428
00:52:43,524 --> 00:52:46,243
You're always losing
your temper with me, auntie.

429
00:52:46,243 --> 00:52:48,723
Won't you give me a chance?
What had you asked me to do?

430
00:52:48,723 --> 00:52:50,603
You asked me to go to
the physician, didn't you?

431
00:52:50,603 --> 00:52:53,400
I did go to him to
fetch your medicines.

432
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,920
But he wasn't there.

433
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,640
He's supposed to be ill...

434
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,720
...and has gone to the neighboring
village for treatment.

435
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,838
I didn't mention the doctor and
you gave me a whole lecture!

436
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:06,037
What else did you ask me to do?

437
00:53:06,037 --> 00:53:08,157
Didn't I ask you to fetch some
raw mangoes for the pickle?

438
00:53:08,157 --> 00:53:10,836
But you will never remember!

439
00:53:10,836 --> 00:53:16,155
Oh sure, you did tell me!
I'll go and fetch them right away!

440
00:53:17,393 --> 00:53:20,634
Lmamsaheb! Do you want me
to reach you home?

441
00:53:20,634 --> 00:53:22,113
Who's that?

442
00:53:22,113 --> 00:53:25,951
Basanti! It's you today.

443
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:28,671
I've spent years in this village.

444
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:30,710
You weren't even born then.

445
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:34,349
But even before I can alight
the steps of the mosque...

446
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:37,748
...there is someone
to reach me home.

447
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:39,508
Why wouldn't anyone?

448
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:42,348
There's not a soul in town
who does not respect you.

449
00:53:42,348 --> 00:53:45,306
When they respect you so much,
why won't they help you too?

450
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:47,226
It's all very natural.
Actually...

451
00:53:47,226 --> 00:53:51,625
When you can talk so much, why don't
you talk some sense to Ahmed too?

452
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:54,024
He's even younger to you.

453
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:57,423
I know how to make them
see sense, lmam.

454
00:53:57,423 --> 00:53:59,182
I can make your son
see reason too.

455
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:05,181
But unless I know what I have
to talk about, how will I?

456
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:09,700
Ahmed's uncle works for a beedi-
manufacturing factory in Jabalpur.

457
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:12,899
- He earns 300 Rupees every month!
- Really?

458
00:54:12,899 --> 00:54:15,977
He has written to me so very often
to send Ahmed over...

459
00:54:15,977 --> 00:54:18,696
...so he'll talk to his boss and
find Ahmed a job in the same factory.

460
00:54:18,696 --> 00:54:21,455
But Ahmed is just not
prepared to go!

461
00:54:21,455 --> 00:54:24,255
He says I'd be left all alone!

462
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:27,253
- Hi! How are you?
- I'm fine, all right.

463
00:54:27,253 --> 00:54:31,493
Now tell me; you've completed your
matriculation and speak English too.

464
00:54:31,493 --> 00:54:33,892
And as your uncle
in Jabalpur writes...

465
00:54:33,892 --> 00:54:36,691
There you are! You're taken up
with my father says, too!

466
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,251
That's the only thing he says
to anyone who meets him.

467
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:40,930
So what's wrong? I just answered
a question she asked.

468
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:43,929
You know, I'm not used
to talking without reason.

469
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:46,728
But just think it over!
It's a beedi-manufacturing factory!

470
00:54:46,728 --> 00:54:51,127
Work while you work... and smoke
a beedi, when you feel like it!

471
00:54:51,408 --> 00:54:53,767
It's like getting all the
mangoes for nothing...

472
00:54:53,767 --> 00:54:56,366
- My God!
- What's wrong?

473
00:54:56,366 --> 00:54:59,604
The mangoes! I forgot them again!

474
00:54:59,604 --> 00:55:01,083
- The raw-mangoes!
- The raw mangoes?

475
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:04,523
Yes. I had to fetch them
for the pickle...

476
00:55:24,517 --> 00:55:27,476
Well? What are you doing here?

477
00:55:27,476 --> 00:55:30,955
Well...! That's how it is.

478
00:55:30,955 --> 00:55:33,235
Well... which mango do you
want me to knock off?

479
00:55:33,235 --> 00:55:35,674
Can you really shoot down
the mango I want?

480
00:55:35,674 --> 00:55:37,794
That's child's play!

481
00:55:37,794 --> 00:55:40,113
The best of the big shots pay
respects at my meet...

482
00:55:40,113 --> 00:55:43,632
...and swear they haven't seen
a marksman like me!

483
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:45,431
You seem to be a damn good-shot!

484
00:55:45,431 --> 00:55:48,510
Sure... he's of royal
descent, isn't he?

485
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:52,429
- What was that he said?
- Never mind. He talks nonsense.

486
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:55,468
So, which mango do you want?

487
00:55:55,548 --> 00:55:59,627
That one there... the other one,
too. And yet another one there.

488
00:56:11,983 --> 00:56:14,504
My word! Your friend
is a great shot, too!

489
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,423
Eh? Oh, yes. Bright chap, you know.

490
00:56:16,423 --> 00:56:18,701
I'm still teaching him...
He'll learn soon.

491
00:56:18,701 --> 00:56:22,300
- Can you teach me, too?
- Certainly! I can teach you, too!

492
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:25,380
In fact, I can teach you this
in a matter of two days.

493
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,339
- In just two days?!
- Of course.

494
00:56:27,339 --> 00:56:31,538
There have been people he has
"taught" in a couple of hours!

495
00:56:33,177 --> 00:56:36,217
- In just a couple of hours!
- He talks nonsense, you know!

496
00:56:36,217 --> 00:56:40,015
Well, come with me, if you
wish to learn this.

497
00:56:40,015 --> 00:56:42,335
Can you see that mango there?

498
00:56:42,335 --> 00:56:43,895
- You can see it, can't you?
- Sure.

499
00:56:43,895 --> 00:56:46,335
Now hold the gun...

500
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:50,853
...and bring this other hand...
close to the other.

501
00:56:51,252 --> 00:56:56,051
Now place this finger
on the trigger.

502
00:56:56,492 --> 00:56:59,009
Now close your eye and...

503
00:56:59,009 --> 00:57:02,009
I have already shut my eyes!

504
00:57:02,009 --> 00:57:03,968
What is he talking about?

505
00:57:03,968 --> 00:57:06,568
The usual nonsense!

506
00:57:06,568 --> 00:57:09,807
- Now close your eyes.
- Very well.

507
00:57:09,807 --> 00:57:13,845
You've shut your eyes, have you?
Now... can you see that mango?

508
00:57:13,845 --> 00:57:17,845
Strange! How can I see the mango,
when I've shut my eyes?

509
00:57:18,404 --> 00:57:20,604
- Have you shut both your eyes?!
- Yes.

510
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:24,082
But you must shut only
your left eye... this one!

511
00:57:24,082 --> 00:57:27,442
Now use your other eye
to aim at the mango.

512
00:57:27,442 --> 00:57:30,800
- Okay. And what do I do now?
- Now? Well...

513
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,440
Now squeeze the trigger!

514
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:39,958
He's found his mark!

515
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:43,917
I thought I was learning
to handle a gun.

516
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:46,557
But now I smell a rat!

517
00:57:46,557 --> 00:57:50,555
A rat? What is that?
I don't understand!

518
00:57:50,555 --> 00:57:52,474
But I understand this
perfectly well!

519
00:57:52,474 --> 00:57:56,674
You city-guys think we in the
countryside are morons!

520
00:57:56,674 --> 00:58:02,872
But Basanti could very well
teach you a lesson!

521
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:07,231
I was only teaching you!
You're misunderstanding me!

522
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:09,349
I understand you very well!

523
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:13,629
Sit here with your gun!
I'm going home!

524
00:58:13,629 --> 00:58:16,267
Good-bye!

525
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:59,140
Kashiram! Dholiya!
Where the hell are all of you?

526
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:07,177
Come, Shankar...
what have you brought?

527
01:01:07,177 --> 01:01:09,897
It's some jowar, sir.

528
01:01:09,897 --> 01:01:14,697
Bloody fiend! You give us
a handful of jowar?

529
01:01:14,697 --> 01:01:17,495
D'you want to feed the guests at your
daughter's wedding with the rest?

530
01:01:17,495 --> 01:01:20,455
I speak the truth, sir!
I've brought all I had!

531
01:01:20,455 --> 01:01:25,413
We need just one bullet
to blow your brains out!

532
01:01:26,133 --> 01:01:29,411
The stinking bastard!

533
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:33,731
And what have you got, Dholiya?

534
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:35,050
It's wheat, sir.

535
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:39,209
Very well. Keep all the stuff there.

536
01:01:39,209 --> 01:01:41,688
Hold it.

537
01:01:41,728 --> 01:01:44,848
Welcome, Thakur!

538
01:01:44,848 --> 01:01:47,167
You're still alive, are you?

539
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:51,245
Yes. And till such time
as I live...

540
01:01:51,245 --> 01:01:56,364
...tell Gabbar you won't even
get a grain from this village.

541
01:01:56,364 --> 01:01:58,844
And who's going to stop us? You?

542
01:01:58,844 --> 01:02:03,802
Yes. My men and I will.

543
01:02:06,121 --> 01:02:08,440
These men?

544
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:12,998
Heard that, guys? The Thakur has
built an army of eunuchs!

545
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:17,518
Death hovers over
your head, Kalia!

546
01:02:17,518 --> 01:02:20,956
Just look around!

547
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:37,432
Two of them? Is that all?

548
01:02:37,432 --> 01:02:40,271
That's enough for you.

549
01:02:40,271 --> 01:02:44,230
Kashiram... have all
the things taken back.

550
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:46,630
Think it over, Thakur.

551
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,549
When Gabbar gets to know...

552
01:02:48,549 --> 01:02:52,148
...that people of this village
refuse to give him foodgrains...

553
01:02:52,148 --> 01:02:54,987
...there can be a lot
of bloodshed.

554
01:02:54,987 --> 01:02:59,466
Why must you simply...

555
01:03:05,384 --> 01:03:07,064
Get lost!

556
01:03:07,064 --> 01:03:08,743
And tell Gabbar...

557
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:13,302
...that the people of Ramgarh
have stopped feeding mad dogs!

558
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:17,261
Go away!

559
01:03:17,261 --> 01:03:22,299
All right, Thakur!
I will go away!

560
01:04:09,206 --> 01:04:11,606
How many were they?

561
01:04:11,606 --> 01:04:15,483
There were two of them, chief.

562
01:04:21,682 --> 01:04:23,841
Two of them?

563
01:04:23,841 --> 01:04:27,640
Goddamned bastards!

564
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:34,478
There were just two of them...
and there were three of you.

565
01:04:34,478 --> 01:04:37,518
You have still returned...

566
01:04:37,518 --> 01:04:41,877
...without anything.

567
01:04:44,476 --> 01:04:47,274
What did you expect?

568
01:04:47,274 --> 01:04:50,354
That I'd be delighted?!

569
01:04:50,354 --> 01:04:53,872
That I'd congratulate you?!

570
01:04:54,633 --> 01:04:57,871
Shame on you!

571
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:04,350
Samba!

572
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:06,949
What prize has the Government
placed on my head?

573
01:05:06,949 --> 01:05:09,988
Fifty thousand Rupees, no less.

574
01:05:09,988 --> 01:05:13,027
Did you hear him?

575
01:05:13,027 --> 01:05:16,026
Fifty grand!

576
01:05:16,026 --> 01:05:19,506
And that's only because...

577
01:05:19,506 --> 01:05:23,624
...when children as many as
50 miles away from here...

578
01:05:23,624 --> 01:05:26,943
...when the babies are hollering
away in the nights...

579
01:05:26,943 --> 01:05:31,102
...their mother ask them to go to
sleep, lest Gabbar Singh arrives!

580
01:05:32,581 --> 01:05:35,341
And these bastards!

581
01:05:35,341 --> 01:05:40,499
They've done my reputation to dust!

582
01:05:41,499 --> 01:05:47,216
You will be punished.
You certainly will!

583
01:05:52,936 --> 01:05:54,975
How many bullets does
this gun have?

584
01:05:54,975 --> 01:05:57,574
- How many bullets in this?
- There are six, chief.

585
01:05:57,574 --> 01:06:00,974
Six bullets.

586
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:06,851
This gun has six bullets.

587
01:06:07,211 --> 01:06:11,531
Six bullets... for just 3 men.

588
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:15,969
That's an injustice!

589
01:06:20,687 --> 01:06:26,086
It's okay now... it certainly is.

590
01:06:26,246 --> 01:06:30,684
Three parts of this now hold
bullets; and three are empty.

591
01:06:32,045 --> 01:06:37,363
I'll just roll the
whole stuff over.

592
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:42,401
I don't know now where the bullets
are, or where they are not.

593
01:06:42,401 --> 01:06:47,960
I know nothing!

594
01:06:49,438 --> 01:07:00,036
This gun now holds three lives
and three deaths.

595
01:07:01,555 --> 01:07:05,074
Let's see what they get.

596
01:07:10,872 --> 01:07:13,872
He's escaped!

597
01:07:29,588 --> 01:07:32,946
He's escaped, too!

598
01:07:40,183 --> 01:07:42,983
What's gonna happen
of you, Kaliya?

599
01:07:42,983 --> 01:07:48,261
Chief! I've always lived
on what I got from you!

600
01:07:48,261 --> 01:07:54,141
It's time you stopped a bullet.

601
01:07:59,299 --> 01:08:01,977
This is amazing!

602
01:08:13,254 --> 01:08:15,535
All three have escaped!

603
01:08:15,535 --> 01:08:20,653
None of the bastards
stopped a bullet!

604
01:08:46,246 --> 01:08:49,444
All three have escaped!

605
01:09:24,634 --> 01:09:29,113
Death to the cowards!

606
01:18:30,076 --> 01:18:34,435
Well... so this is the
Thakur's soldier!

607
01:18:37,634 --> 01:18:42,392
Kaliya told us there
were two of them, Samba.

608
01:18:43,793 --> 01:18:46,232
Where is the other?

609
01:18:46,232 --> 01:18:50,270
Where are you, soldier?!

610
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:54,469
Hey, soldier... where
is your partner?

611
01:18:54,469 --> 01:18:55,869
Speak up!

612
01:18:55,869 --> 01:18:58,509
Listen, you other soldier!

613
01:18:58,509 --> 01:19:02,187
Will you step out, or do
I gun down your friend here?

614
01:19:02,187 --> 01:19:05,266
Hold it!

615
01:19:06,426 --> 01:19:11,583
Welcome...! Welcome!

616
01:19:13,383 --> 01:19:17,383
We now have you in
our clutches!

617
01:19:17,783 --> 01:19:20,341
Welcome...

618
01:19:22,061 --> 01:19:25,501
Good-boy!

619
01:19:37,457 --> 01:19:43,254
Well, Thakur? You brought these guys
to protect Ramgarh, did you?

620
01:19:43,814 --> 01:19:46,574
To take on Gabbar, did you?

621
01:19:46,574 --> 01:19:48,933
Listen, you villagers!

622
01:19:48,933 --> 01:19:51,892
Take a look out here!

623
01:19:51,892 --> 01:19:56,372
These the guys who came here
to protect you from me!

624
01:19:56,372 --> 01:20:00,730
Have they lost your pluck?
All of it?!

625
01:20:04,648 --> 01:20:09,528
There's only one man who can
save you from Gabbar's wrath!

626
01:20:10,687 --> 01:20:13,805
And that's Gabbar himself!

627
01:20:13,805 --> 01:20:18,885
In exchange for your security, if
we take some provisions from you...

628
01:20:19,324 --> 01:20:21,563
...that is no crime or injustice!

629
01:20:21,563 --> 01:20:27,202
No crime, I say!
It's no injustice!

630
01:20:29,242 --> 01:20:33,640
That's it then! Should anyone
dare raise his head again...

631
01:20:33,921 --> 01:20:37,080
...I will...

632
01:20:41,518 --> 01:20:43,437
The heads!

633
01:20:43,437 --> 01:20:47,636
You think these guys are
accomplished fighters, don't you?

634
01:20:47,636 --> 01:20:49,915
These hired-gunmen will now...

635
01:20:49,915 --> 01:20:55,874
...place their heads on my feet
and beg for mercy!

636
01:20:57,675 --> 01:21:01,712
They will beg at my feet!

637
01:21:04,071 --> 01:21:09,590
You've heard me, haven't you?
You have?

638
01:21:10,151 --> 01:21:14,109
Those heads of yours...
at my feet!

639
01:21:15,947 --> 01:21:18,228
Come on.

640
01:21:18,228 --> 01:21:21,387
Move, I say!

641
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:54,937
Hurry up, Dhanno!

642
01:23:38,866 --> 01:23:43,546
We can't wage this battle
for you anymore, Thakur!

643
01:23:43,546 --> 01:23:48,143
We held you in great respect.
But it's all over!

644
01:23:48,143 --> 01:23:51,103
We came here for
the brave inspector...

645
01:23:51,103 --> 01:23:55,262
...who waged a lone battle against
a gang of bandits in the train.

646
01:23:55,262 --> 01:23:57,461
We didn't come here
for a coward...

647
01:23:57,461 --> 01:24:02,659
...who couldn't pick up a gun lying
before him to save our lives!

648
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:07,058
It's okay, if you wish to leave.

649
01:24:07,058 --> 01:24:08,778
You can go.

650
01:24:08,778 --> 01:24:13,897
Before you leave, won't you
want to know the reason...

651
01:24:14,176 --> 01:24:17,177
...why I didn't pick up
this gun lying here?

652
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:21,334
What reason can there be?
You're a coward!

653
01:24:23,855 --> 01:24:26,693
It's a long story.

654
01:24:30,172 --> 01:24:34,490
It happened during the days I was
posted at the Belapur police station.

655
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:38,969
We got information that Gabbar was
going to loot the village Haripur.

656
01:24:39,729 --> 01:24:41,768
The police raided them
at the right time...

657
01:24:41,768 --> 01:24:44,049
...and the bandits had to flee.

658
01:24:44,049 --> 01:24:48,847
I started chasing Gabbar.

659
01:26:47,092 --> 01:26:51,172
Let me go... let go...
Leave me alone, you bastard!

660
01:26:51,172 --> 01:26:55,490
Gabbar Singh! This is no arm!
This is a noose!

661
01:26:57,690 --> 01:27:00,488
In view of the testimonies
and the evidence at hand...

662
01:27:00,488 --> 01:27:02,448
...this Court reaches
the conclusion that...

663
01:27:02,448 --> 01:27:06,886
...Gabbar Singh is a dangerous
and professional criminal.

664
01:27:06,886 --> 01:27:09,926
This court, therefore, holding
him guilty of dacoity...

665
01:27:09,926 --> 01:27:15,203
...sentences him to 20 years
of rigorous imprisonment.

666
01:27:20,524 --> 01:27:25,201
I'll remember you...
I'm sure, I will remember you.

667
01:27:26,081 --> 01:27:30,600
After 20 years in the prison,
you will forget everything, Gabbar.

668
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,919
No prison in the world
has walls strong enough...

669
01:27:33,919 --> 01:27:37,358
...to hold Gabbar captive
for 20 long years.

670
01:27:37,358 --> 01:27:43,236
And the day I escape...
you will regret it, Thakur.

671
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:46,755
You're going to regret it.

672
01:27:46,755 --> 01:27:48,394
Take him away.

673
01:27:48,394 --> 01:27:52,553
This enmity's going to
cost you dear, Thakur!

674
01:27:55,672 --> 01:27:58,671
Thakur! Congratulations!

675
01:27:58,671 --> 01:28:03,390
Another criminal you've nabbed
is coming to my prison.

676
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:08,468
He's a dangerous man, jailer.
You'd better be careful.

677
01:28:08,468 --> 01:28:11,708
I'm glad your application
for leave has come through.

678
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:14,907
It had to anyway. You're going on
leave after a very long time.

679
01:28:14,907 --> 01:28:19,265
Had I not taken leave now, my folks
would have stopped talking to me.

680
01:28:20,185 --> 01:28:23,585
It's the same story with
everyone in our profession.

681
01:28:23,585 --> 01:28:25,024
I face the same problem.

682
01:28:25,024 --> 01:28:26,943
How many members do
you have in your family?

683
01:28:26,943 --> 01:28:32,102
I have two sons who are married and
a daughter of marriageable age, too.

684
01:28:32,942 --> 01:28:35,860
I want to find a nice groom
for her this time.

685
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:37,859
I also have a grandson.

686
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:40,059
Really? You don't look so old!

687
01:28:40,059 --> 01:28:43,019
We in the village are
married very early in life.

688
01:28:43,019 --> 01:28:46,058
An early marriage means
the son comes early, too.

689
01:28:46,058 --> 01:28:49,097
Since the son marries early,
he has a son very soon.

690
01:28:49,097 --> 01:28:51,137
In fact, he's about
8 years of age.

691
01:28:51,137 --> 01:28:54,055
Old enough to take offence if
you don't visit him on leave?

692
01:28:54,055 --> 01:28:55,655
You bet!

693
01:28:55,655 --> 01:28:59,654
I'm carrying gifts for everyone,
in order to pacify them.

694
01:28:59,654 --> 01:29:03,733
There you are then; I've never
accepted a bribe in my life.

695
01:29:03,733 --> 01:29:07,531
But I have to bribe my family,
whenever I go home!

696
01:29:07,531 --> 01:29:10,930
I must take your leave now.

697
01:29:13,170 --> 01:29:16,649
- What is it?
- Gabbar Singh has escaped, sir!

698
01:29:16,649 --> 01:29:19,967
Gabbar Singh has escaped?!

699
01:29:20,926 --> 01:29:22,968
You've missed again!

700
01:29:22,968 --> 01:29:24,807
You're no good, uncle!

701
01:29:24,807 --> 01:29:27,725
Oh sure! Your father's been hunting
lions, hasn't he? Just shut up!

702
01:29:27,725 --> 01:29:30,965
You're going to the station to
receive grandpa, aren't you?

703
01:29:30,965 --> 01:29:33,604
- May I come along, too?
- Go and ask your mother.

704
01:29:33,604 --> 01:29:35,204
Why don't you tell her?

705
01:29:35,204 --> 01:29:39,402
Just tell her that you're
going with me. Go on.

706
01:29:40,522 --> 01:29:42,562
Mother...

707
01:29:42,562 --> 01:29:45,121
Let me cut the vegetables.

708
01:29:45,121 --> 01:29:47,440
May I go to the station
with uncle, mother?

709
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,279
No. You're not going
to the station.

710
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:53,399
Madam... I've asked someone
to fix the main-gate.

711
01:29:54,518 --> 01:30:00,236
And here are the things
you had asked for...

712
01:30:02,155 --> 01:30:07,314
- Young mistress!
- I'm coming over!

713
01:30:13,032 --> 01:30:17,272
I'm going to the temple. But if
there is anything I can do...?

714
01:30:17,272 --> 01:30:19,431
Go on. I'll handle it.

715
01:30:19,431 --> 01:30:22,991
- Let's go.
- Give me that.

716
01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:28,588
- May I go to the station, mom?
- Haven't I said you can't?

717
01:30:28,588 --> 01:30:31,187
Let him go, if he wants to.

718
01:30:31,187 --> 01:30:33,747
No way. There are always so many
trains passing by.

719
01:30:33,747 --> 01:30:34,826
I'm scared.

720
01:30:34,826 --> 01:30:38,345
The trains seem to have an axe
to grind against your son.

721
01:30:38,345 --> 01:30:41,904
They'll leave their tracks
to go after him!

722
01:30:41,904 --> 01:30:45,504
You have a funny logic.

723
01:30:45,504 --> 01:30:48,422
So you're preparing the
vegetable father likes, eh?

724
01:30:48,422 --> 01:30:52,421
- Let him go, I say.
- Okay! Go ahead and spoil him!

725
01:30:52,421 --> 01:30:55,300
Will you go like this?
Go and have a bath.

726
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:58,180
Ask your aunt to...
Nirmala!

727
01:30:58,180 --> 01:30:59,418
Yes, sister-in-law?

728
01:30:59,418 --> 01:31:01,539
Will you get a set of clothes
out for the kid, my girl?

729
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:03,418
Right away.

730
01:31:03,418 --> 01:31:04,738
Go on.

731
01:31:04,738 --> 01:31:08,217
And you've started chewing
on the raw vegetables!

732
01:31:08,418 --> 01:31:11,615
They're all busy today
to impress father!

733
01:31:11,615 --> 01:31:15,454
As if you get the witch to
do the chores every day!

734
01:31:15,454 --> 01:31:18,813
This wheel is still lying here?

735
01:31:18,813 --> 01:31:22,652
Ramlal has become
a forgetful old man.

736
01:31:22,652 --> 01:31:27,572
I'd asked him to have the drawing
room and father's room cleaned.

737
01:31:27,851 --> 01:31:29,611
But he's not even to be seen.

738
01:31:29,611 --> 01:31:34,369
He's away at the temple with Radha.
He will do it when he returns.

739
01:31:34,369 --> 01:31:36,848
- Hey, Ninni!
- Yes, brother?

740
01:31:36,848 --> 01:31:40,767
Have a bath and get ready!
Aren't we going to the station?

741
01:31:40,767 --> 01:31:44,886
I'll join you in a minute!

742
01:31:44,886 --> 01:31:49,564
I can't figure out how this silly
hunter found a wife like Radha.

743
01:31:50,604 --> 01:31:53,283
It was I who asked father
to pursue the alliance.

744
01:31:53,283 --> 01:31:55,924
But does anyone even
acknowledge what I've done?

745
01:31:55,924 --> 01:31:58,642
I've found him a wife
who's one in a million!

746
01:31:58,642 --> 01:32:02,641
Or girls nowadays ask for a division
the day they are married.

747
01:32:02,641 --> 01:32:07,160
Wait and see what a great match
I find for Nimmo next.

748
01:32:14,357 --> 01:32:17,397
No!

749
01:36:28,164 --> 01:36:31,163
Gabbar?

750
01:36:33,482 --> 01:36:36,281
Yes...

751
01:38:29,529 --> 01:38:32,727
Welcome, Thakur.

752
01:38:32,727 --> 01:38:37,166
I knew for sure
that you'd come here.

753
01:38:40,367 --> 01:38:43,725
The ass struggles!

754
01:38:43,725 --> 01:38:47,643
You contemptible bastard!
God-damn scoundrel!

755
01:38:47,724 --> 01:38:51,762
Curse me as much as you wish!
To your heart's content!

756
01:38:51,762 --> 01:38:55,801
- You bastard!
- Yes! Shout some more!

757
01:38:55,801 --> 01:39:00,921
Remember? I cried the other day
and you watched the fun?

758
01:39:00,921 --> 01:39:04,998
You will cry your lungs out today...
and I will watch the fun!

759
01:39:04,998 --> 01:39:07,318
Know what, Samba?

760
01:39:07,318 --> 01:39:11,957
I was livid at the court that
day... so very furious!

761
01:39:12,676 --> 01:39:16,436
I could have wrung his neck
there and then! The bastard!

762
01:39:16,436 --> 01:39:20,594
But I couldn't help it!
I was held by four of those cops!

763
01:39:20,594 --> 01:39:24,832
Handcuffs in my hands...
my legs shackled! Remember?

764
01:39:25,152 --> 01:39:28,913
You remember that, don't you?

765
01:39:31,072 --> 01:39:35,190
Any last wish, Thakur?

766
01:39:40,308 --> 01:39:44,547
There's still a lot
of life in your arms.

767
01:39:44,547 --> 01:39:47,625
Tie him up!

768
01:39:59,463 --> 01:40:03,063
I'm not going to kill you now.

769
01:40:03,063 --> 01:40:08,380
After I'm through with you...
the world will spit on you.

770
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:13,139
Your arms are full of life!

771
01:40:13,139 --> 01:40:18,657
His arms are strong enough
to pull down a running horse!

772
01:40:19,456 --> 01:40:23,376
Your arms are full of life!

773
01:40:23,376 --> 01:40:26,134
D'you remember what you
had once told me?

774
01:40:26,134 --> 01:40:30,014
They aren't arms...
they're a noose!

775
01:40:30,014 --> 01:40:34,413
And here you are!
The noose has been destroyed!

776
01:40:34,413 --> 01:40:37,012
It has been ripped open!

777
01:40:37,012 --> 01:40:40,730
Arms full of life, aren't they?

778
01:40:41,211 --> 01:40:43,570
These arms...

779
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:46,529
...give them to me, Thakur.
- No!

780
01:40:46,529 --> 01:40:51,888
- Give me your arms, Thakur!
- No!

781
01:42:11,344 --> 01:42:13,824
- Did you see anything else?
- No, sir.

782
01:42:13,824 --> 01:42:17,182
We shut our doors and windows
when we heard the gunfire.

783
01:42:17,182 --> 01:42:20,461
I see... very well.

784
01:42:20,461 --> 01:42:24,542
- Put your thumb-impression here.
- Very well, sir.

785
01:42:25,101 --> 01:42:27,940
Welcome, Thakur.

786
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:33,258
I've got to know of what happened
here, from these folks.

787
01:42:33,258 --> 01:42:34,939
I wanted to discuss
something with you.

788
01:42:34,939 --> 01:42:40,056
The police want Gabbar;
dead or alive.

789
01:42:40,056 --> 01:42:44,534
You will have him one day.

790
01:42:44,534 --> 01:42:47,255
Is there something you can
tell me about Gabbar?

791
01:42:47,255 --> 01:42:49,454
No.

792
01:42:49,454 --> 01:42:53,012
Okay. That's all I wanted to know.

793
01:42:53,012 --> 01:42:56,052
Thank you, Thakur.

794
01:42:58,692 --> 01:43:01,410
Good-bye.

795
01:43:13,046 --> 01:43:18,445
We don't want that money, Thakur.

796
01:43:19,324 --> 01:43:21,924
Please take it back.

797
01:43:21,924 --> 01:43:25,804
Please don't think, we won't carry
out the mission for you.

798
01:43:25,804 --> 01:43:32,040
But didn't you say
you only work for money?

799
01:43:32,681 --> 01:43:36,160
Well, we...

800
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:39,119
We will get the money anyway.

801
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:43,557
- Once we have killed Gabbar...
- You will not kill Gabbar!

802
01:43:44,477 --> 01:43:49,636
You are here to catch Gabbar alive
and hand him over to me.

803
01:43:50,476 --> 01:43:55,913
Give me your word! That you will
hand him over to me, alive!

804
01:43:59,314 --> 01:44:06,311
We give you our word, Thakur.
But please take back the money.

805
01:44:07,792 --> 01:44:13,550
Girija, the blacksmith, brings
some news from village Titli.

806
01:44:15,388 --> 01:44:20,307
You might meet Gabbar
again very soon.

807
01:44:20,307 --> 01:44:22,786
Come on.

808
01:44:24,746 --> 01:44:27,865
- Greetings, Thakur.
- Greetings.

809
01:44:27,865 --> 01:44:30,064
So what's news, Girija?

810
01:44:30,064 --> 01:44:33,143
There are some gypsies
staying at Pipri.

811
01:44:33,143 --> 01:44:36,342
Hira and his friends
are there too.

812
01:44:36,942 --> 01:44:40,542
Hira is the one who sells
arms and ammunition to Gabbar.

813
01:44:40,542 --> 01:44:44,780
Gabbar is bound to meet him
in a couple of days.

814
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:47,539
Strike... when the iron is hot.

815
01:49:29,977 --> 01:49:34,816
My God! What happened to him?

816
01:49:34,816 --> 01:49:38,696
Don't worry. The bullet has
just grazed his arm.

817
01:49:38,696 --> 01:49:41,734
It's not a serious injury.

818
01:49:42,174 --> 01:49:45,012
We blew up almost all their
arms and explosives, Thakur...

819
01:49:45,012 --> 01:49:47,573
...but Gabbar managed to escape.

820
01:49:47,573 --> 01:49:52,132
It's okay. We'll get him
again someday.

821
01:49:55,210 --> 01:50:00,210
Take a swig, partner.
Your troubles will vanish.

822
01:50:00,210 --> 01:50:04,887
Should you stop drinking, it will
reduce most of your troubles.

823
01:50:04,887 --> 01:50:08,366
- Would you like to...?
- God almighty!

824
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:33,399
Greetings, lmam.
I have a letter for you.

825
01:50:33,399 --> 01:50:36,997
- Here you are.
- It must be from Jabalpur.

826
01:50:36,997 --> 01:50:40,958
- Could you read it for me?
- Certainly.

827
01:50:40,958 --> 01:50:44,436
Where are my glasses?
I put it in my pocket!

828
01:50:44,436 --> 01:50:48,355
That which you are looking for
is here with me!

829
01:50:48,355 --> 01:50:50,714
- Here you are!
- The chatterbox is here, isn't she?

830
01:50:50,714 --> 01:50:54,793
Actually, we were going in
the opposite directions.

831
01:50:54,793 --> 01:50:57,192
You were on your bicycle
and I was on foot.

832
01:50:57,192 --> 01:51:00,552
You dropped your glasses
and I picked them up!

833
01:51:00,552 --> 01:51:03,590
I guessed as much that the
glasses must belong to you.

834
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:07,588
The funny part is, it's
really yours. Actually...

835
01:51:07,588 --> 01:51:10,349
If you rest your mouth a little,
I'd know what the letter says.

836
01:51:10,349 --> 01:51:13,508
- I'll listen to you later.
- Okay! When did I refuse?

837
01:51:13,508 --> 01:51:18,906
- It begins with a greeting.
- Greetings himself, too.

838
01:51:19,225 --> 01:51:24,184
Everything is fine here and we
pray for your well-being.

839
01:51:25,024 --> 01:51:29,463
"The good news is that the job
for Ahmed has been finalized"

840
01:51:29,463 --> 01:51:31,863
"He will get a salary
of 200 Rupees"

841
01:51:31,863 --> 01:51:35,261
"He can very well stay with me
and eat with us, too"

842
01:51:35,261 --> 01:51:38,139
It's good that he will
be in his uncle's care.

843
01:51:38,139 --> 01:51:40,820
Oh yes! That's wonderful!
That's just what I wanted, too.

844
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:43,579
"It wouldn't be proper to delay
this matter anymore"

845
01:51:43,579 --> 01:51:46,977
"I hope you will treat this
letter like a telegram"

846
01:51:46,977 --> 01:51:50,456
"Please arrange to send
Ahmed here at the earliest"

847
01:51:50,456 --> 01:51:53,856
"Everything else is fine here;
my folks send you their regards"

848
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:58,294
- " I remain, yours...
- Mukait Ul-lah.

849
01:51:58,294 --> 01:52:00,613
I will not listen to any
excuse from Ahmed now.

850
01:52:00,613 --> 01:52:04,813
That's right.
But he's very much here.

851
01:52:04,813 --> 01:52:07,651
Let me tell you, father.
I'm not going there.

852
01:52:07,651 --> 01:52:12,211
- This is like...
- This boy is a fool!

853
01:52:12,211 --> 01:52:16,489
I have one foot in the grave and you
have your life ahead of you!

854
01:52:16,889 --> 01:52:22,047
How long will you cling to me?
You don't find such jobs everyday.

855
01:52:22,448 --> 01:52:24,447
Your father is right, son.

856
01:52:24,447 --> 01:52:31,284
In fact, I've heard of people
praying at temples in the cities...

857
01:52:32,245 --> 01:52:35,883
- The temple?!
- What's wrong?

858
01:52:35,883 --> 01:52:40,802
Actually, I was headed for the temple
and happened to find his glasses.

859
01:52:41,162 --> 01:52:43,881
That's it! I forgot
where I was going!

860
01:52:44,202 --> 01:52:48,920
But I've remembered it now!

861
01:52:49,479 --> 01:52:55,319
Hey, Veeru... there goes
your horse-cart girl.

862
01:52:58,636 --> 01:53:02,355
Well, Basanti...
you're on foot today.

863
01:53:02,355 --> 01:53:05,355
Has your mare run away
with the cart?

864
01:53:05,355 --> 01:53:11,433
You still don't understand
that no one elopes out here.

865
01:53:11,872 --> 01:53:14,113
My mare is honorably at home
and today being a Monday...

866
01:53:14,113 --> 01:53:19,950
...aunt told me that if I pray
to Lord Shiva on every Monday...

867
01:53:20,271 --> 01:53:23,149
...l'll get a husband that
the world will be stunned.

868
01:53:23,149 --> 01:53:27,269
I said, okay... I don't intend
to marry a bum anyway.

869
01:53:27,629 --> 01:53:31,267
Okay, then... I must leave.
Praise the Lord!

870
01:53:35,547 --> 01:53:38,265
Praise the Lord!

871
01:53:42,225 --> 01:53:44,703
Praise the Lord!

872
01:54:01,219 --> 01:54:05,258
Lord! There is nothing in the
world that is hidden from You.

873
01:54:05,778 --> 01:54:08,017
You are omniscient, Lord!

874
01:54:08,017 --> 01:54:10,736
I don't say that You have
forgotten it.

875
01:54:10,736 --> 01:54:13,295
But it's always good
to remind You.

876
01:54:13,295 --> 01:54:17,175
Today's a Monday and I have
a small request, Lord.

877
01:54:17,175 --> 01:54:23,053
Look at my hands, rough and rugged
from holding the reins!

878
01:54:23,692 --> 01:54:26,093
And what problems
could You have, Lord?

879
01:54:26,093 --> 01:54:30,130
Get me married into a family where
I will rule like the Queens!

880
01:54:30,611 --> 01:54:33,769
Life's gotta be fun!

881
01:54:33,769 --> 01:54:38,248
I leave the rest to You.

882
01:54:38,248 --> 01:54:40,967
Young lady...

883
01:54:40,967 --> 01:54:43,766
Who spoke?

884
01:54:43,766 --> 01:54:47,046
It is I who has spoken!

885
01:54:47,046 --> 01:54:52,484
Lord! It's You!
This is a miracle!

886
01:54:53,283 --> 01:54:58,723
I have found a match
for you, lady.

887
01:54:59,522 --> 01:55:02,401
In just one Monday?
That's excellent!

888
01:55:02,401 --> 01:55:05,041
You must obviously have
chosen the best!

889
01:55:05,041 --> 01:55:09,199
Could You tell me the name, perhaps?
Or do I come again next week?

890
01:55:09,199 --> 01:55:10,439
I will do as You say, Lord.

891
01:55:10,439 --> 01:55:13,598
His name is Veeru.

892
01:55:13,598 --> 01:55:18,716
Veeru?! This has to do with my life!
Please don't make haste, Lord!

893
01:55:19,277 --> 01:55:21,756
I wouldn't mind You taking
a few Mondays more.

894
01:55:21,756 --> 01:55:25,754
He's okay to look at;
but he's a bloody smart ass!

895
01:55:25,754 --> 01:55:27,794
Silence, maiden!

896
01:55:27,794 --> 01:55:32,432
I never talk without reason, Lord!
I'll do as You say!

897
01:55:32,432 --> 01:55:39,071
If you don't obey my command, you
will remain a spinster all your life!

898
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:41,351
Forgive me, Lord!

899
01:55:41,351 --> 01:55:46,548
You will continue to drive the
horse-cart all your life!

900
01:55:47,428 --> 01:55:54,145
I now command you to go and tell
your aunt, in no uncertain terms...

901
01:55:54,827 --> 01:55:59,145
...that it is Veeru who will be
your companion for life!

902
01:56:00,305 --> 01:56:05,182
To respect and honor Veeru therefore
shall be your prime duty!

903
01:56:06,302 --> 01:56:10,862
Because, your heavens
lie at his feet!

904
01:56:11,822 --> 01:56:16,260
Should you please him,
I shall be pleased!

905
01:56:17,219 --> 01:56:22,298
And if you irritate him,
I shall be enraged!

906
01:56:23,178 --> 01:56:25,378
Really?

907
01:56:25,378 --> 01:56:28,817
So go to him...

908
01:56:41,652 --> 01:56:45,251
I thought I would...

909
01:56:45,251 --> 01:56:49,531
You thought this village belle
has no brains!

910
01:56:49,531 --> 01:56:51,370
You thought you could fool me!

911
01:56:51,370 --> 01:56:53,169
You think you're smart!

912
01:56:53,169 --> 01:56:57,807
But I could outsmart guys
like you!

913
01:57:00,687 --> 01:57:05,006
At least listen to me!

914
02:01:04,216 --> 02:01:07,416
I've thought of
something today.

915
02:01:07,416 --> 02:01:10,175
You must do that,
once in a while.

916
02:01:10,175 --> 02:01:13,214
I've taken a very
crucial decision today.

917
02:01:13,214 --> 02:01:17,973
I know what your decision is;
you want to marry Basanti.

918
02:01:18,452 --> 02:01:21,611
That's wonderful!
You're a true friend!

919
02:01:21,611 --> 02:01:23,651
Only a friend could
know how I feel!

920
02:01:23,651 --> 02:01:28,850
But I also know that this is your
8th decision to marry this year.

921
02:01:29,449 --> 02:01:31,089
But this is final!

922
02:01:31,089 --> 02:01:36,207
Really? No wonder... you've been
drinking from early this morning.

923
02:01:36,207 --> 02:01:39,406
- Will you do something for me?
- What is it?

924
02:01:39,406 --> 02:01:43,725
Go and talk to Basanti's aunt;
make such an impression...

925
02:01:44,124 --> 02:01:46,164
...that the old lady is compelled
to propose our marriage!

926
02:01:46,164 --> 02:01:47,204
Why must I do that?

927
02:01:47,204 --> 02:01:50,283
Naturally! It's the groom's folks
who approach the bride's parents!

928
02:01:50,283 --> 02:01:54,322
Besides, you're the only one
I have in the world, my friend!

929
02:01:54,762 --> 02:01:57,640
It's your wedding, okay?
So go and do this yourself.

930
02:01:57,640 --> 02:02:01,920
Give it a thought...
a cozy home, after marriage!

931
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:04,159
- A home that is yours.
- A loving wife...

932
02:02:04,159 --> 02:02:06,238
- Your wife.
- A handful of kids...

933
02:02:06,238 --> 02:02:09,758
- All yours, too.
- You're the one they'll call uncle!

934
02:02:09,758 --> 02:02:12,837
They'll forever pester you,
play with you all the time...

935
02:02:12,837 --> 02:02:17,075
...and ask you
to tell them a story!

936
02:02:19,036 --> 02:02:23,394
Which means I'm going to play
the maid-servant in your house.

937
02:02:25,193 --> 02:02:28,791
It's clear now!
You are no friend!

938
02:02:28,791 --> 02:02:32,111
To hell with such a...

939
02:02:35,190 --> 02:02:39,749
Acting pricey, aren't you? Because
no one else can do this for me?

940
02:02:41,828 --> 02:02:45,266
Had only my mom been alive,
I'd have settled down in life!

941
02:02:45,266 --> 02:02:47,506
I'd even have had kids!

942
02:02:47,506 --> 02:02:51,706
Had my old man been around, he'd
have celebrated my wedding in style!

943
02:02:51,706 --> 02:02:55,744
Had I brothers and sisters, they'd
have begged the old lady...

944
02:02:55,744 --> 02:02:57,623
...but seen to it that
I married Basanti.

945
02:02:57,623 --> 02:03:01,583
But don't you forget! Those without
support, have God on their side!

946
02:03:02,503 --> 02:03:05,462
Lord Almighty!

947
02:03:05,462 --> 02:03:08,420
You're not the friend I knew!

948
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:11,340
You don't want me to give up crime
and settle down in life!

949
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:16,977
What had I imagined you to be...
and what you really are!

950
02:03:21,497 --> 02:03:26,855
The bloody clown...
he's forever up to dramatics!

951
02:03:27,775 --> 02:03:31,694
Cut the act! I'll go and talk
it over with the old lady.

952
02:03:31,694 --> 02:03:33,373
Will you, really?!

953
02:03:33,373 --> 02:03:39,332
An unmarried girl at home is
like a burden on the soul, son.

954
02:03:39,731 --> 02:03:43,930
I can be at peace, only when
Basanti is married.

955
02:03:43,930 --> 02:03:47,889
You're right. You are indeed
bearing a burden.

956
02:03:48,648 --> 02:03:52,328
But I can't just dump her
in a well, can I?

957
02:03:52,328 --> 02:03:56,167
Please don't mind this,
but I must ask...

958
02:03:56,167 --> 02:04:01,205
...about the suitor's family,
his habits and his earnings.

959
02:04:02,405 --> 02:04:07,764
As far as earnings go,
once he is married,

960
02:04:08,202 --> 02:04:11,401
...he will start earning
to fend for them.

961
02:04:11,401 --> 02:04:14,961
Doesn't he earning anything
at the moment, then?

962
02:04:14,961 --> 02:04:18,320
Of course, he does!
When did I say that he doesn't?

963
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:21,518
It's like this; no one can
win all the time, can he?

964
02:04:21,518 --> 02:04:24,599
There are times the poor chap
even loses money.

965
02:04:24,599 --> 02:04:26,118
- Loses money?
- That's right...

966
02:04:26,118 --> 02:04:30,077
...but that's gambling, you know.
There's little I can say about it.

967
02:04:30,077 --> 02:04:32,556
My God! Is he a gambler?

968
02:04:32,556 --> 02:04:36,915
Not at all, madam!
It's a shame to call him a gambler!

969
02:04:37,236 --> 02:04:39,913
He's a gem of a person;
decent and straight.

970
02:04:39,913 --> 02:04:44,913
But when someone is high on liquor,
he can't see things in perspective.

971
02:04:45,353 --> 02:04:49,910
They force him into gambling.
How's poor Veeru to blame?

972
02:04:49,910 --> 02:04:55,990
You're right, son. A drinker and
a gambler... and yet, faultless!

973
02:04:56,270 --> 02:05:01,908
You're misunderstanding my friend.
He's an innocent, young chap.

974
02:05:02,386 --> 02:05:05,427
Just get him married to Basanti...

975
02:05:05,427 --> 02:05:08,545
...he'll give up drinking
and gambling in no time!

976
02:05:08,545 --> 02:05:11,424
Don't tell me, son.
I know better.

977
02:05:11,424 --> 02:05:15,024
Has anyone ever been able to kick
habits like drinking and gambling?

978
02:05:15,024 --> 02:05:19,342
You don't know Veeru. Believe me,
he's not at all like that.

979
02:05:19,342 --> 02:05:23,462
Once he's married, he'll stop
visiting the nautch girl. Period!

980
02:05:23,462 --> 02:05:25,541
His drinking problem will be
solved on its own!

981
02:05:25,541 --> 02:05:29,739
Good Lord! That's all he lacked!
He even visits brothels, does he?

982
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:32,178
So what's wrong with that?

983
02:05:32,178 --> 02:05:36,377
Even kings and princes have
often patronized dancing-girls!

984
02:05:37,098 --> 02:05:42,496
I see... but can you tell me which
family your friend hails from?

985
02:05:43,015 --> 02:05:46,534
We'll let you know that,
the moment we get to know of it!

986
02:05:46,534 --> 02:05:52,253
I must say one thing, son.
For all your friend's vices...

987
02:05:52,813 --> 02:05:56,932
...you can only praise him!

988
02:05:56,932 --> 02:06:00,491
I can't help it, aunt.
I'm really soft at heart.

989
02:06:00,491 --> 02:06:05,769
So, do I take it then that
they will soon be married?

990
02:06:06,049 --> 02:06:08,929
Married? It's okay even if she
remains a spinster all her life!

991
02:06:08,929 --> 02:06:10,448
But I will not let Basanti
marry such a man!

992
02:06:10,448 --> 02:06:14,207
I'm her aunt; not her step-mother!

993
02:06:14,447 --> 02:06:19,046
It's strange that you refuse,
despite the best of my efforts.

994
02:06:20,524 --> 02:06:25,883
Poor Veeru. I don't know
how he will deal with this.

995
02:06:26,603 --> 02:06:30,681
I'll take a jump and die!
Out of my way!

996
02:06:30,681 --> 02:06:34,400
Hey, watch it!
What are you doing?

997
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:38,360
I'm doing just what every
legendary lover has done!

998
02:06:38,799 --> 02:06:43,238
They died for their beloved's!

999
02:06:43,238 --> 02:06:47,478
Suicide!

1000
02:06:50,036 --> 02:06:53,236
Well now... what is suicide?

1001
02:06:53,236 --> 02:06:56,834
When the English die,
they call it suicide.

1002
02:06:56,834 --> 02:06:59,794
But why do the English die?

1003
02:06:59,794 --> 02:07:04,472
What's up, feller? Why do you
want to commit suicide?

1004
02:07:04,871 --> 02:07:09,151
You'd rather not ask!
You'll break into tears!

1005
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:12,829
It's a very sad story!

1006
02:07:12,829 --> 02:07:17,028
It has emotions, drama
and tragedy!

1007
02:07:17,789 --> 02:07:22,348
You know Basanti, don't you?
I was going to marry her.

1008
02:07:22,946 --> 02:07:27,906
But her wicked aunt has
been an obstacle!

1009
02:07:28,705 --> 02:07:32,184
I can't live in this big,
bad world, anymore!

1010
02:07:32,184 --> 02:07:37,982
I bid you farewell, villagers!
Good-bye!

1011
02:07:41,542 --> 02:07:44,101
Well... what is "good-bye"?

1012
02:07:44,101 --> 02:07:46,779
When the English leave,
it's called "good-bye".

1013
02:07:46,779 --> 02:07:49,580
But where do the English go?

1014
02:07:49,580 --> 02:07:53,377
Hey, villagers! Here I go!

1015
02:07:53,377 --> 02:07:55,937
God Almighty! Here I come!

1016
02:07:55,937 --> 02:07:59,176
Hold it! Wait...!

1017
02:07:59,176 --> 02:08:04,615
What?! Okay, if you insist,
I'll wait for a while.

1018
02:08:05,094 --> 02:08:09,333
Hey... you're a strange friend!
You're sitting here unaffected!

1019
02:08:09,614 --> 02:08:11,533
- Why? What's wrong?
- How am I to know?

1020
02:08:11,533 --> 02:08:15,372
Look at your friend!
He's climbed all the way up there!

1021
02:08:16,011 --> 02:08:19,210
You see that, don't you?!

1022
02:08:19,730 --> 02:08:22,370
Yes, I do.
But nothing's going to happen.

1023
02:08:22,370 --> 02:08:25,608
He'll climb down,
when he sobers down.

1024
02:08:25,608 --> 02:08:30,008
I've seen many cruel people.
But not a heartless friend like you!

1025
02:08:30,008 --> 02:08:31,926
Hey, watch out!

1026
02:08:31,926 --> 02:08:36,565
I have no one in the world!
Nor friend, nor buddy...

1027
02:08:37,125 --> 02:08:40,045
So I'm going to end my life!

1028
02:08:40,045 --> 02:08:43,443
But I must warn you, villagers!

1029
02:08:43,443 --> 02:08:49,881
Where a lover ends his life, the
village is wrought with calamities!

1030
02:08:50,121 --> 02:08:52,081
What calamities will
we have to face?

1031
02:08:52,081 --> 02:08:58,839
There will be famine and drought!
Diseases and death!

1032
02:08:59,238 --> 02:09:03,798
And all that only for the sake of
that old hag! That old hag indeed!

1033
02:09:04,078 --> 02:09:05,157
My God!

1034
02:09:05,157 --> 02:09:09,675
You will see for yourselves!
When I die...

1035
02:09:10,276 --> 02:09:15,834
...the police will arrive and take
the old hag away to jail!

1036
02:09:16,634 --> 02:09:23,833
In jail, the old hag will
labor on the grindstone...!

1037
02:09:24,952 --> 02:09:27,791
You'd better agree, lady.
Or he'll kill himself!

1038
02:09:27,791 --> 02:09:30,630
But how can I agree, Dinanath?!

1039
02:09:30,630 --> 02:09:36,029
You don't have to beg for anything
from the hag, villagers!

1040
02:09:36,468 --> 02:09:38,787
Nothing can stop me now!

1041
02:09:38,787 --> 02:09:42,587
I will certainly end my life!

1042
02:09:42,587 --> 02:09:46,785
Here goes; one, two, three...

1043
02:09:46,785 --> 02:09:49,024
Please, aunt! Agree to what he says!

1044
02:09:49,024 --> 02:09:51,343
You'd better agree, or do the rounds
of the courts and police stations!

1045
02:09:51,343 --> 02:09:53,184
But I've never been a court
or a police station!

1046
02:09:53,184 --> 02:09:54,943
- Then you'd better agree.
- All right.

1047
02:09:54,943 --> 02:09:59,581
Stop that, Veeru!
I agree!

1048
02:09:59,581 --> 02:10:04,141
The old lady has agreed!
Now quietly come down!

1049
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:06,939
Who wants to marry
the old lady!

1050
02:10:06,939 --> 02:10:10,458
It's Dhanno... I mean,
it's Basanti I want to marry.

1051
02:10:10,458 --> 02:10:14,658
I'm willing to marry you, Veeru!
Come down now!

1052
02:10:15,057 --> 02:10:17,896
Hear that, villagers?

1053
02:10:17,896 --> 02:10:22,375
The old lady is willing...
and so is Basanti!

1054
02:10:22,853 --> 02:10:25,974
So my death has been cancelled!

1055
02:10:25,974 --> 02:10:29,333
I'm coming down, aunt...
my adorable aunt!

1056
02:10:29,333 --> 02:10:32,691
I'm coming down...

1057
02:10:35,851 --> 02:10:39,889
What am I going to do now?!

1058
02:10:56,884 --> 02:10:59,684
- So long, father.
- You're leaving, are you?

1059
02:10:59,684 --> 02:11:01,883
Go on... my God protect you.

1060
02:11:01,883 --> 02:11:04,922
Write to me, the moment
you reach there.

1061
02:11:04,922 --> 02:11:09,881
You're a very careless eater;
look after your health, okay?

1062
02:11:09,881 --> 02:11:13,680
As my father, God bless his soul,
used to say...

1063
02:11:13,680 --> 02:11:18,438
...in good health lies
true happiness and wealth.

1064
02:11:18,438 --> 02:11:21,957
Let me walk with you for a while.
I'll get myself some air, too.

1065
02:11:21,957 --> 02:11:25,117
It's okay, father. Relax...
I'll go away from here.

1066
02:11:25,117 --> 02:11:30,155
Really? Okay, then...
Let's embrace.

1067
02:11:34,473 --> 02:11:37,354
Hurry up, Junga... I hold
the Queen of clubs.

1068
02:11:37,354 --> 02:11:41,551
That's okay, Samba. But look there;
the easy prey.

1069
02:12:15,181 --> 02:12:17,501
- Chief...
- Yes?

1070
02:12:17,501 --> 02:12:19,981
This boy's from Ramgarh.

1071
02:12:19,981 --> 02:12:24,459
He was on his way to the station,
when we found him.

1072
02:13:48,154 --> 02:13:53,993
Why's there so much
of silence here?

1073
02:14:01,472 --> 02:14:04,791
- Imam-saheb...
- Who's that?

1074
02:14:04,791 --> 02:14:09,829
Veeru? Why's there so much
of silence here, son?

1075
02:14:11,109 --> 02:14:14,187
Please come with me.

1076
02:14:14,187 --> 02:14:18,666
- Please come...
- What's wrong?

1077
02:14:18,666 --> 02:14:23,705
What's up, son?
Where are you leading me...

1078
02:14:23,705 --> 02:14:26,663
Who's that?

1079
02:14:31,503 --> 02:14:34,062
Ahmed?!

1080
02:14:34,062 --> 02:14:39,420
Ahmed!

1081
02:15:00,573 --> 02:15:04,133
Lmamsaheb, I must...

1082
02:15:04,133 --> 02:15:08,212
How will you console him, Thakur?
You're responsible for all this.

1083
02:15:08,212 --> 02:15:10,690
It's true!

1084
02:15:10,690 --> 02:15:15,850
And you villagers had better listen
to this letter from Gabbar, too!

1085
02:15:17,330 --> 02:15:21,487
Addressed to the people of Ramgarh,
it says, "Look at the..."

1086
02:15:21,487 --> 02:15:26,367
"consequences of challenging me
at the Thakur's instigation"

1087
02:15:26,367 --> 02:15:29,646
"Should you folks still
not mend your ways..."

1088
02:15:29,646 --> 02:15:33,805
"death shall perform its ugly dance
in every courtyard of Ramgarh!"

1089
02:15:33,805 --> 02:15:37,883
"Should you care for the lives
of your family and children..."

1090
02:15:38,363 --> 02:15:40,962
"...then before sunrise tomorrow..."

1091
02:15:40,962 --> 02:15:45,760
"hand over the Thakur's men
to me, at the old hillock"

1092
02:15:46,321 --> 02:15:50,240
He has signed it off as "Gabbar
Singh, chief of the bandits."

1093
02:15:50,240 --> 02:15:54,199
How could you land us in such
a grave danger, Thakur!

1094
02:16:04,356 --> 02:16:10,594
To lead an honorable life, we will
have to pay a price, Dinanath.

1095
02:16:11,754 --> 02:16:16,073
And we can pay the bandits
with food-grains for our lives.

1096
02:16:16,632 --> 02:16:19,472
We can't pay them with
our children's lives!

1097
02:16:19,472 --> 02:16:22,510
We're farmers, after all.
We are not soldiers.

1098
02:16:22,510 --> 02:16:27,150
You are right, Shankar.
We are indeed farmers.

1099
02:16:27,150 --> 02:16:30,388
This has been a country
of farmers for many ages.

1100
02:16:30,388 --> 02:16:34,308
But whenever someone evil has
shown aggressive designs...

1101
02:16:34,308 --> 02:16:38,986
...by God, it was farmers who
melted their ploughs into swords!

1102
02:16:40,265 --> 02:16:45,984
It's not the blood of cowards
that flows in our veins! No!

1103
02:16:46,344 --> 02:16:49,822
But how is violence and bloodshed
going to help?

1104
02:16:49,822 --> 02:16:52,741
Non-violence has its place, too.

1105
02:16:52,741 --> 02:16:55,622
I do believe in non-violence.

1106
02:16:55,622 --> 02:16:58,020
But it won't be an
act of non-violence...

1107
02:16:58,020 --> 02:17:00,619
...to grovel before
a wicked and evil man!

1108
02:17:00,619 --> 02:17:02,779
It's nothing but cowardliness!
Plain spinelessness!

1109
02:17:02,779 --> 02:17:05,618
Those who don't bow
are broken down, Thakur!

1110
02:17:05,618 --> 02:17:10,017
This Thakur can neither be made
to bow nor be broken down!

1111
02:17:10,017 --> 02:17:13,695
This Thakur can only die!

1112
02:17:13,695 --> 02:17:18,135
But I will live in dignity,
till as long as I live!

1113
02:17:18,535 --> 02:17:22,093
For how long are you going to live?
And how long will we live either...

1114
02:17:22,093 --> 02:17:25,612
...with these guys
around in the village?

1115
02:17:27,132 --> 02:17:31,330
If you think you can save
your children's lives...

1116
02:17:31,330 --> 02:17:34,809
...by handing us over
to Gabbar Singh...

1117
02:17:34,809 --> 02:17:39,088
...you can very well give us
up to Gabbar. We are willing.

1118
02:17:39,488 --> 02:17:42,527
Yes. We must do
the right thing now.

1119
02:17:42,527 --> 02:17:46,807
We can't bear the burden
of this problem anymore.

1120
02:17:46,807 --> 02:17:51,644
Who's speaking of not
bearing the burden?

1121
02:17:51,644 --> 02:17:56,082
Do you know what is the biggest
burden in the world?

1122
02:17:58,003 --> 02:18:01,841
A father bearing
the bier of his son!

1123
02:18:01,841 --> 02:18:05,081
There can be no bigger burden.

1124
02:18:05,081 --> 02:18:07,921
An old man like me is willing
to bear this burden...

1125
02:18:07,921 --> 02:18:12,719
...and you refuse
to combat a problem?

1126
02:18:14,638 --> 02:18:19,557
There's something I very
strongly believe in.

1127
02:18:20,237 --> 02:18:24,515
An honorable death is any day better
than a life of humiliation.

1128
02:18:25,594 --> 02:18:29,434
It's I, who has lost a son.

1129
02:18:29,434 --> 02:18:33,472
But I'd still want both of them
to stay on in this village.

1130
02:18:34,872 --> 02:18:38,831
I leave the rest to you.

1131
02:18:43,550 --> 02:18:47,188
It's time for my prayers.

1132
02:18:47,188 --> 02:18:49,868
I will ask God today
why He did not give me...

1133
02:18:49,868 --> 02:18:54,626
...some more sons to be
sacrificed for the village.

1134
02:18:57,745 --> 02:19:02,264
Will someone please help me
reach the mosque...?

1135
02:20:30,759 --> 02:20:34,358
What's that? A letter?

1136
02:20:34,358 --> 02:20:36,317
Of course, you idiot!
Read it.

1137
02:20:36,317 --> 02:20:40,555
"If you kill one villager, Gabbar,
we will slay four of your men"

1138
02:20:42,036 --> 02:20:47,514
Check out if it's those guys, or
have they dumped someone else here?

1139
02:21:21,223 --> 02:21:28,102
"For every villager you kill, Gabbar,
we will slay four of your men"

1140
02:21:39,538 --> 02:21:42,738
The fun begins now!

1141
02:21:42,738 --> 02:21:47,857
It's ages since I've run into
someone who boasts so much!

1142
02:21:48,976 --> 02:21:52,974
The real fun begins now!

1143
02:21:52,974 --> 02:21:57,493
This game will end with the
lives of these two guys.

1144
02:21:59,852 --> 02:22:05,651
Every family and household in
Ramgarh, will end with this, too!

1145
02:22:10,770 --> 02:22:13,328
Here you are.

1146
02:22:15,048 --> 02:22:18,008
It was really bothering you.

1147
02:22:33,443 --> 02:22:36,243
She's a very unfortunate girl.

1148
02:22:36,243 --> 02:22:39,521
It's almost as if she has
forgotten to speak.

1149
02:22:39,521 --> 02:22:44,039
As for earlier, I'm always reminded
of those days...

1150
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:49,638
...when I first visited her village
with my master.

1151
02:22:49,638 --> 02:22:51,158
It was on the festival
of colors.

1152
02:22:51,158 --> 02:22:53,517
Hey! That's enough!

1153
02:22:53,517 --> 02:22:57,516
It's the festival of colors!
No one can take offense!

1154
02:22:57,516 --> 02:23:01,075
How will I celebrate with your father
if you douse all the colors on me?

1155
02:23:01,075 --> 02:23:04,074
How will you celebrate the festival
with my father in any case?

1156
02:23:04,074 --> 02:23:06,234
He just doesn't know how
to celebrate the festival!

1157
02:23:06,234 --> 02:23:08,873
He's been sitting at home
all day!

1158
02:23:08,873 --> 02:23:12,431
Either he touches the feet
of the elders visiting him...

1159
02:23:12,431 --> 02:23:15,472
...or the younger ones touch his
feet as a mark of respect.

1160
02:23:15,472 --> 02:23:18,350
They apply a pinch of color on each
other's forehead from a plate...

1161
02:23:18,350 --> 02:23:22,708
...embrace each other and
that's it! They've celebrated it!

1162
02:23:22,708 --> 02:23:26,388
That's no way of doing it!
It's us, who really celebrate it!

1163
02:23:26,388 --> 02:23:28,587
Really? And how do
you celebrate it?

1164
02:23:28,587 --> 02:23:32,507
You know Paro, don't you?

1165
02:23:32,507 --> 02:23:34,345
- Paro?
- Yes! Paro!

1166
02:23:34,345 --> 02:23:39,503
There's a tank in her courtyard.
We've mixed all the colors in it!

1167
02:23:39,824 --> 02:23:41,702
Where folks normally douse
color on people...

1168
02:23:41,702 --> 02:23:44,943
...we dump people
in the colors!

1169
02:23:44,943 --> 02:23:49,502
The moment we spot someone,
he goes straight in the tank!

1170
02:23:49,502 --> 02:23:52,580
I hope you don't have a tank
of colors in your house!

1171
02:23:52,580 --> 02:23:57,819
Or Ramlal and I will find
ourselves neck-deep in it.

1172
02:23:58,099 --> 02:23:59,978
Watch what I do!

1173
02:23:59,978 --> 02:24:01,698
Anyone in, mister?

1174
02:24:01,698 --> 02:24:04,057
Who's that?

1175
02:24:04,057 --> 02:24:08,296
- I've scared you again!
- You're crazy!

1176
02:24:08,296 --> 02:24:10,575
The Thakur!
You didn't even tell me!

1177
02:24:10,575 --> 02:24:14,693
Welcome! Greetings of the season!

1178
02:24:14,693 --> 02:24:17,614
What are you standing there for?

1179
02:24:17,614 --> 02:24:20,492
Won't you bring some sweets
for the Thakur?

1180
02:24:20,492 --> 02:24:22,132
Just a moment...

1181
02:24:22,132 --> 02:24:24,331
- Must I bring the plate too?
- Which one?

1182
02:24:24,331 --> 02:24:27,009
The one from which you will
take a pinch of color...

1183
02:24:27,009 --> 02:24:30,090
Sure, go ahead and bring it.

1184
02:24:30,090 --> 02:24:32,369
Please come, Thakur.

1185
02:24:32,369 --> 02:24:37,406
Let's go and sit there...
it's very loud out here.

1186
02:24:37,406 --> 02:24:41,765
- So, Ramlal? Is everything fine?
- I'm fine, thank you, sir.

1187
02:24:41,765 --> 02:24:44,565
Well, Thakur? I hope you've
had a nice crop this year.

1188
02:24:44,565 --> 02:24:47,523
Actually, I'm an outsider
in my own house.

1189
02:24:47,523 --> 02:24:51,003
It's Ramlal who knows everything
about my farms.

1190
02:24:51,003 --> 02:24:54,842
It's he who commands things
in our farms.

1191
02:24:54,842 --> 02:24:58,241
Sweets for everyone!

1192
02:24:58,241 --> 02:25:00,921
Open your mouth, uncle!

1193
02:25:00,921 --> 02:25:04,119
That's enough, dear...

1194
02:25:04,119 --> 02:25:06,399
Okay, Mr. Ramlal...
open your mouth!

1195
02:25:06,399 --> 02:25:08,759
- Give it to me, dear. I'll have it.
- No, sir!

1196
02:25:08,759 --> 02:25:10,518
- I will feed you!
- Give it to me, dear.

1197
02:25:10,518 --> 02:25:14,796
She's like your daughter, Ramlal.
Let her feed you.

1198
02:25:15,276 --> 02:25:20,475
He's right. Now open your mouth!

1199
02:25:20,475 --> 02:25:24,553
My God! How could I forget the
plate with the colors?

1200
02:25:24,753 --> 02:25:26,192
She's a very jovial girl.

1201
02:25:26,192 --> 02:25:30,192
You bet! She's always
kicking up a racket!

1202
02:25:30,192 --> 02:25:32,751
Here I come with
the plate of colors!

1203
02:25:32,751 --> 02:25:37,151
Here's the plate of colors for you
to take a pinch out of it!

1204
02:25:37,550 --> 02:25:41,390
- I'm leaving!
- Where are you going?

1205
02:25:41,390 --> 02:25:46,747
I'm going to my friends to celebrate!
May I leave?

1206
02:25:46,747 --> 02:25:49,266
Haven't you had enough
of the colors yet?

1207
02:25:49,266 --> 02:25:53,665
It's a festival of colors, uncle...
of all hues!

1208
02:25:56,425 --> 02:25:58,183
How can anyone ever have
enough of the colors?

1209
02:25:58,183 --> 02:26:00,704
Tell me; wouldn't the world be
so dull, without these colors?

1210
02:26:00,704 --> 02:26:05,382
How dull and lifeless her world
has suddenly come to be.

1211
02:26:09,420 --> 02:26:14,020
With her tears having washed away
her bridal-henna...

1212
02:26:14,380 --> 02:26:20,058
...what colors can
she look forward to in life?

1213
02:27:44,593 --> 02:27:50,351
I've taken a decision.

1214
02:27:51,191 --> 02:27:54,870
Really? So you've started
taking decisions too?!

1215
02:27:54,870 --> 02:27:59,469
Yes. When you are into it,
I think I'd rather do it too.

1216
02:27:59,908 --> 02:28:01,988
- What is that?
- Get married.

1217
02:28:01,988 --> 02:28:06,187
Get married?!

1218
02:28:06,667 --> 02:28:08,346
You want to get married?!

1219
02:28:08,346 --> 02:28:11,584
Yes... I've had enough.

1220
02:28:11,584 --> 02:28:15,544
I've now decided to lead
a straight and simple life.

1221
02:28:15,544 --> 02:28:19,983
In which I have a house of my own,
a wife, many children...

1222
02:28:19,983 --> 02:28:22,701
...who will pester you
for stories...

1223
02:28:22,701 --> 02:28:26,781
Hey! That's enough!
Sit down here, will you?

1224
02:28:26,781 --> 02:28:30,020
Sit down here, I say.

1225
02:28:30,020 --> 02:28:33,978
I hope you know that you need
a girl to get married to?

1226
02:28:35,178 --> 02:28:37,978
Have you approved of a girl then?

1227
02:28:37,978 --> 02:28:43,056
- Yes, I have.
- Who is she, may I ask?

1228
02:28:46,575 --> 02:28:48,734
That Radha?!

1229
02:28:48,734 --> 02:28:52,133
Are you mad? Don't you know
who she is?

1230
02:28:52,133 --> 02:28:58,252
Now look; even thugs and criminals
are given a second chance in life.

1231
02:28:58,931 --> 02:29:01,490
And then, Radha has done
nothing wrong.

1232
02:29:01,490 --> 02:29:04,050
Has she no right to start
life afresh?

1233
02:29:04,050 --> 02:29:08,328
How can that be? What will society
and community think of it?

1234
02:29:09,208 --> 02:29:14,727
The society and community are meant
to save man from loneliness.

1235
02:29:15,885 --> 02:29:18,926
They're not meant to
isolate someone.

1236
02:29:18,926 --> 02:29:23,204
Besides, must we let Radha suffer
in silence for fear of society?

1237
02:29:25,964 --> 02:29:30,523
How long are we going to live
anyway? We might soon be dead.

1238
02:29:31,402 --> 02:29:36,400
Whose support will she live on?
Whom will she turn to?

1239
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:39,960
It was because of all this
that I came to you.

1240
02:29:39,960 --> 02:29:44,358
But you are her father.
I leave the decision to you.

1241
02:29:44,358 --> 02:29:47,399
Not at all, Thakur.
She's your daughter now.

1242
02:29:47,399 --> 02:29:52,596
Whatever you decide will be
best for her.

1243
02:29:52,596 --> 02:29:57,235
I'd still want you to
meet Jai at least once.

1244
02:29:57,235 --> 02:30:01,074
I'll send him over
in a couple of days.

1245
02:30:15,389 --> 02:30:17,950
A penny for your thoughts!

1246
02:30:17,950 --> 02:30:21,388
It's nothing.

1247
02:30:21,388 --> 02:30:26,265
I get it! I know what
you're worrying about.

1248
02:30:26,265 --> 02:30:30,546
You're wondering whether your
proposal will come through.

1249
02:30:30,985 --> 02:30:33,544
I suggest you toss again.

1250
02:30:33,544 --> 02:30:37,983
If it's Heads, it's gonna
be okay. Or else... well!

1251
02:30:40,023 --> 02:30:45,500
If everything works out
well, Veeru...

1252
02:30:46,659 --> 02:30:49,939
...why don't we settle down here,
in this village?

1253
02:30:49,939 --> 02:30:52,739
There! You've spoken my heart!

1254
02:30:52,739 --> 02:30:55,138
I've been thinking of this, too.

1255
02:30:55,138 --> 02:30:57,697
It's no use being thieves
all our lives.

1256
02:30:57,697 --> 02:30:59,697
We've spent enough time
in the prisons.

1257
02:30:59,697 --> 02:31:03,216
Once we get the money,
let's settle down here.

1258
02:31:03,216 --> 02:31:06,534
We'll buy some land and
turn farmers.

1259
02:31:06,534 --> 02:31:11,014
But we can't use the plough...
how will we be farmers?

1260
02:31:11,653 --> 02:31:17,091
Our vices taught us to wield guns;
our virtues will teach us this.

1261
02:31:17,451 --> 02:31:21,051
You're right. Necessity does
teach a man a lot in life.

1262
02:31:21,051 --> 02:31:23,770
I've already worked out
everything for myself!

1263
02:31:23,770 --> 02:31:25,289
I'll marry the girl
who drives the horse-cart...

1264
02:31:25,289 --> 02:31:28,647
...and be the father of a
couple of children in 2/3 years.

1265
02:31:28,647 --> 02:31:30,928
I've even thought
of the brats' names!

1266
02:31:30,928 --> 02:31:35,167
And when I ask my wife
where the kids are...

1267
02:31:35,167 --> 02:31:36,806
She'll say...

1268
02:31:36,806 --> 02:31:41,045
"They must be with your friend Jai
to listen to his stories"

1269
02:31:42,445 --> 02:31:47,363
Why must you always send your
children to me for stories?

1270
02:31:48,002 --> 02:31:52,321
You know I can't remember
these bloody stories, Jai!

1271
02:31:52,321 --> 02:31:56,320
Stories, my foot! You don't even
remember what happened yesterday.

1272
02:31:56,320 --> 02:32:00,039
Yesterday? Of course I remember
I met Basanti yesterday!

1273
02:32:00,039 --> 02:32:04,158
We've promised to meet
at the lake this morning!

1274
02:32:04,158 --> 02:32:07,117
- This morning, huh?
- Yes!

1275
02:32:07,117 --> 02:32:09,836
Here I go!

1276
02:32:26,872 --> 02:32:29,870
Let's go, Dhanno!

1277
02:32:37,348 --> 02:32:43,226
Let's go! It's a question
of my chastity today!

1278
02:33:07,779 --> 02:33:11,778
Go on, Dhanno! Faster!

1279
02:33:47,208 --> 02:33:51,887
Faster, Dhanno! Go for it!

1280
02:36:16,724 --> 02:36:21,523
What do these guys in Ramgarh
feed their daughters with?

1281
02:36:22,803 --> 02:36:28,401
Look at her... she's one hell
of a spicy doll, isn't she?

1282
02:36:30,441 --> 02:36:32,280
Damn spicy, all right!

1283
02:36:32,280 --> 02:36:36,758
Remember how we went to Jamnadas's
daughter's wedding last year, chief?

1284
02:36:37,158 --> 02:36:39,358
She'd given them a terrific
dance performance there.

1285
02:36:39,358 --> 02:36:41,437
Wow!

1286
02:36:41,437 --> 02:36:45,836
She must be a sizzling dancer!

1287
02:36:45,836 --> 02:36:50,155
Show us a couple
of steps, darling.

1288
02:36:50,155 --> 02:36:54,514
Now look, lady... don't you
act too high and mighty!

1289
02:36:54,514 --> 02:37:00,032
Or I'll scratch off this
beautiful skin... all right?

1290
02:37:05,790 --> 02:37:11,069
Wait a minute, darling.

1291
02:37:13,228 --> 02:37:16,427
Tie the bastard!

1292
02:37:22,986 --> 02:37:28,224
You seem to be thick with him,
what say?

1293
02:37:32,823 --> 02:37:38,180
Well, strong man? Mohammad
comes to the mountain, eh?

1294
02:37:38,901 --> 02:37:43,220
You have a scene with
that babe, do you?

1295
02:37:43,220 --> 02:37:48,538
You bastard! I've yet to see
a creep like you!

1296
02:37:49,417 --> 02:37:52,977
You won't get to see one either.

1297
02:37:54,137 --> 02:37:57,575
Because your life is
now going to end.

1298
02:37:57,575 --> 02:38:01,415
- The bastard...
- No!

1299
02:38:10,931 --> 02:38:16,091
Like a house on fire, eh?

1300
02:38:18,608 --> 02:38:22,689
You're pretty thick, aren't you?

1301
02:38:22,689 --> 02:38:27,087
Pick up your gun, Samba!

1302
02:38:28,527 --> 02:38:32,725
And aim your gun at this cur!

1303
02:38:36,084 --> 02:38:38,444
Now listen to me, darling.

1304
02:38:38,444 --> 02:38:43,963
If you wish to save your lover,
show us some dance.

1305
02:38:44,282 --> 02:38:49,081
No! Don't you dare dance
before this dogs, Basanti!

1306
02:38:54,999 --> 02:38:59,358
Delay this any longer, and we'll
blow your lover's head apart!

1307
02:39:01,037 --> 02:39:05,116
There's another thing
I must tell you, darling.

1308
02:39:05,396 --> 02:39:08,235
That man will breathe,
only till you continue to dance.

1309
02:39:10,314 --> 02:39:14,394
That gun will go off, the
moment your feet stop moving.

1310
02:45:02,332 --> 02:45:07,452
If anyone dare moves,
he's gonna be dead meat!

1311
02:45:08,251 --> 02:45:12,489
Gabbar Singh! Ask your men
to drop their guns!

1312
02:45:16,888 --> 02:45:19,808
Go on

1313
02:46:36,826 --> 02:46:39,864
Go after them! Go on!

1314
02:46:39,864 --> 02:46:44,102
And don't return empty-handed,
you bastards!

1315
02:46:44,423 --> 02:46:47,223
Hurry up!

1316
02:48:13,716 --> 02:48:17,835
- Jai! Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm okay.

1317
02:48:19,355 --> 02:48:23,395
The three of us can't escape
on a single horse, Veeru.

1318
02:48:23,395 --> 02:48:27,393
Take Basanti away to the village
and return soon.

1319
02:48:27,712 --> 02:48:32,192
And bring lots of ammunition
when you return.

1320
02:48:33,071 --> 02:48:37,309
No! I will stay here!
Take Basanti and leave quickly!

1321
02:48:37,309 --> 02:48:41,429
Listen to me, Veeru!
Take Basanti away! I'll stay here.

1322
02:48:41,429 --> 02:48:44,188
No, Jai! I can't leave you alone.

1323
02:48:44,188 --> 02:48:46,427
One of us will have to go, Veeru.

1324
02:48:46,427 --> 02:48:49,986
Or else, we'll soon
run out of bullets.

1325
02:48:49,986 --> 02:48:53,586
Well, all right.
Let's toss instead.

1326
02:48:53,586 --> 02:48:57,944
If it's Heads, I stay back.
If it's Tails, you hold fort.

1327
02:49:00,343 --> 02:49:03,064
I win!

1328
02:49:05,782 --> 02:49:08,501
- But how can you be...
- No more arguments, Veeru!

1329
02:49:08,501 --> 02:49:12,860
Leave your gun and bullets behind.
And take Basanti out quickly! Go on!

1330
02:49:18,138 --> 02:49:20,937
I somehow don't feel like
leaving you alone, Jai.

1331
02:49:20,937 --> 02:49:25,377
- Take care, okay?
- Sure.

1332
02:53:11,471 --> 02:53:14,630
There's just one bullet!

1333
02:54:18,931 --> 02:54:23,170
- Are you okay, Jai?!
- Yes... I'm okay.

1334
02:54:24,009 --> 02:54:28,328
I've killed every
single bastard before...

1335
02:54:28,888 --> 02:54:33,327
Don't worry, Jai!
Just don't be scared!

1336
02:54:34,327 --> 02:54:38,245
Why must I be scared when
you're with me, Veeru?

1337
02:54:38,245 --> 02:54:42,165
Let's return to our village!
Everything will be all right!

1338
02:54:42,165 --> 02:54:45,324
My game is up, Veeru.

1339
02:54:45,324 --> 02:54:47,563
- It's all over...
- No!

1340
02:54:47,563 --> 02:54:51,282
No, Jai! Don't say such things!

1341
02:54:51,282 --> 02:54:55,441
But I have no regrets, Veeru.

1342
02:54:55,441 --> 02:54:59,479
I have lived for my friend...
and am dying before him!

1343
02:55:00,158 --> 02:55:04,239
But there is something
I'm leaving unfinished, Veeru.

1344
02:55:04,239 --> 02:55:06,317
I won't be able to tell
stories to your children.

1345
02:55:06,317 --> 02:55:09,196
You're going to be all right, Jai!
Nothing will happen to you!

1346
02:55:09,196 --> 02:55:15,075
But you must tell your children
tales of our friendship and exploits.

1347
02:55:15,395 --> 02:55:16,995
You won't forget that, will you?

1348
02:55:16,995 --> 02:55:20,154
What nonsense are you talking?!

1349
02:55:22,953 --> 02:55:26,193
Look there, Veeru...

1350
02:55:31,029 --> 02:55:34,390
There's yet another
incomplete story, Veeru.

1351
02:55:34,390 --> 02:55:37,628
What had I dreamed of;
and what has come to be?

1352
02:55:37,628 --> 02:55:43,188
No, Jai!
You can't leave me like this!

1353
02:55:43,627 --> 02:55:45,027
No!

1354
02:55:45,027 --> 02:55:49,025
No, Jai! Please don't!

1355
02:55:49,025 --> 02:55:55,384
No, Jai!
You can't do this to me!

1356
02:58:32,018 --> 02:58:39,136
Jai! You have cheated me
to save my life?

1357
02:58:44,055 --> 02:58:47,694
I swear upon the blood
that you have shed!

1358
02:58:47,694 --> 02:58:52,253
I will pick and choose each
one of them, and give them death!

1359
02:58:53,092 --> 02:58:58,451
Gabbar Singh!
I'm coming after you!

1360
02:59:47,155 --> 02:59:49,756
Run! But how far
will you go, you swine!

1361
02:59:56,353 --> 03:00:00,154
Gabbar! Come out in the open!

1362
03:00:00,154 --> 03:00:03,191
Face me like a man,
you bastard!

1363
03:00:03,191 --> 03:00:07,550
I've come to avenge every drop
of blood that my friend has shed!

1364
03:00:08,111 --> 03:00:12,948
You can't escape death today!

1365
03:01:40,443 --> 03:01:47,441
Hand him over to me, Veeru.

1366
03:01:47,961 --> 03:01:52,759
No, Thakur! I'm not going to
let this bastard live anymore!

1367
03:01:53,360 --> 03:01:55,239
Don't forget your promise, Veeru!

1368
03:01:55,239 --> 03:01:57,079
I don't remember anything!

1369
03:01:57,079 --> 03:02:01,397
All I know is that this bastard's
men have killed my friend!

1370
03:02:02,197 --> 03:02:04,877
And I'm going to have
his blood for that!

1371
03:02:04,877 --> 03:02:10,515
It was that very friend of yours
who had made a promise to me.

1372
03:02:10,515 --> 03:02:14,075
Leave him alone.

1373
03:02:22,110 --> 03:02:28,549
I wish it was I who had made the
promise; I'd have broken it today!

1374
03:02:29,509 --> 03:02:33,387
But it was my friend
who gave you his word.

1375
03:02:33,387 --> 03:02:36,068
So...

1376
03:03:18,656 --> 03:03:25,293
You can't fight me, Thakur!
I've already cut your arms!

1377
03:03:26,733 --> 03:03:31,811
One uses his feet, not his hands,
to crush the snake, Gabbar!

1378
03:03:32,730 --> 03:03:36,690
My feet are enough
to deal with you!

1379
03:03:58,683 --> 03:04:04,041
Your arms are full of
strength, aren't they?

1380
03:04:56,946 --> 03:05:01,025
Gabbar! Give your hands to me!

1381
03:05:01,025 --> 03:05:02,745
No!

1382
03:05:02,745 --> 03:05:05,664
Give me this hand, Gabbar!

1383
03:05:05,664 --> 03:05:09,023
No!

1384
03:06:25,401 --> 03:06:28,280
Let him go!

1385
03:06:28,800 --> 03:06:33,359
It is up to the justice system to...
punish a criminal.

1386
03:06:33,559 --> 03:06:36,638
Justice needs Gabbar...

1387
03:06:36,638 --> 03:06:41,116
Dead or alive!

1388
03:06:41,397 --> 03:06:46,995
Your emotions have overcome your...
duties and responsibilities?

1389
03:06:48,673 --> 03:06:53,473
Justice does not have any respect left?

1390
03:06:56,672 --> 03:07:00,830
Thakur Sahib... I know of your sufferings.

1391
03:07:00,830 --> 03:07:04,309
But don't forget... that you've been...
such a police officer...

1392
03:07:04,309 --> 03:07:08,028
that you are still idolized today.

1393
03:08:41,920 --> 03:08:46,880
Well, Thakur...
I must leave now.

1394
03:08:50,079 --> 03:08:54,437
I know I can't share your grief;
But I do

1395
03:09:33,600 --> 03:09:59,999
