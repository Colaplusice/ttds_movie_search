1
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,854
Come on, boys!

2
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:44,493
The way you're lollygagging around here
with them picks and them shovels...

3
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,440
...you'd think it was 120...

4
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:50,990
It can't be more than 114.

5
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:57,299
Dock that Chink a day's pay
for napping on the job.

6
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:04,433
Now, come on, boys, where's your
spirit? I don't hear no singing.

7
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,307
When you were slaves,
you sang like birds.

8
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,374
Go on. How about a good
old nigger work song?

9
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:23,984
"I get no kick from champagne.

10
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:31,344
"Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all.

11
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:36,556
"So tell me why should it be true...

12
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,378
"...that I get a belt out of you?

13
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,453
"Some get a kick from cocaine."

14
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,311
What the hell is that shit?

15
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:00,689
I meant a song. A real song.

16
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,252
Something like...

17
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:07,179
"Swing low, sweet chariot..."

18
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:11,919
Swing low? Sweet chariot?

19
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:13,552
Don't know that one, huh?

20
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:17,900
How about "De Camp Town Ladies"?

21
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,447
"De Camp Town Ladies"?

22
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:25,705
Ah, you know.

23
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:31,274
"De Camp Town Ladies sing this song,
doo-dah, doo-dah.

24
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:35,630
"De Camp Town race track five
miles long, all the doo-dah day!

25
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:39,625
"Gonna run all night,
gonna run all day.

26
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:43,467
"Bet my money on the bobtailed
nag, somebody bet on the bay!"

27
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:56,429
What in the wide, wide world
of sports is going on here?

28
00:04:56,688 --> 00:04:59,208
I hired you people to try to get
a little track laid...

29
00:04:59,536 --> 00:05:02,503
...not to jump around like a
bunch of Kansas City faggots!

30
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,545
Sorry, Mr. Taggart. I, I guess
we kind of got caught up.

31
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,069
Dummy, the surveyors say they may
have run into some quicksand up ahead.

32
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:10,346
Better check it out.

33
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:13,612
Okay, I'll send down a team of
horses to check out the ground.

34
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:18,408
Horses! We can't afford to lose
any horses, you dummy!

35
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:20,486
Send over a couple of niggers.

36
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:25,766
You and you.

37
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:31,210
Sir, he specifically requested
two niggers...

38
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:36,295
...but to tell a family secret,
my grandmother was Dutch.

39
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:39,684
Get on that hand car and take it
down to the end of that line!

40
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:41,421
Just trying to help you out.

41
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,738
I didn't know your grandma was Dutch!

42
00:05:49,454 --> 00:05:53,927
"Oh, de Camp Town Ladies sing
this song, doo-dah, doo-dah.

43
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:59,044
"Camp Town race track five
miles long, oh, doo-dah day.

44
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,206
"Going to run all night,
going to run all day.

45
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:07,210
"I waged my money on the bobtail nag,
somebody bet on the bay!"

46
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,121
Am I wrong...

47
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:17,444
...or is the world rising?

48
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,969
I don't know, but whatever
it is, I hate it.

49
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:25,701
Let me ask you something.

50
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:31,044
What is it that's not exactly water,
and it's not exactly earth?

51
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:33,481
Quicksand!

52
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,227
Oh, shit, quicksand!

53
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:43,745
Goddang, now we are in trouble!

54
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:45,735
They're in trouble!

55
00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:49,640
Get your rope there.
Get over there quick.

56
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:04,767
Dang, that was lucky.

57
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:08,095
Doggone near lost a $400 hand cart.

58
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:19,169
Yeah, we can take it right off to the,
just a little bit to the left of that hill.

59
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:22,879
But we're going to die, Bart.
They're going to leave us here to die!

60
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:26,951
Take it easy, Charlie.
My foot is on the rail.

61
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:35,590
Then maybe down that canyon.
I think it's pretty level off there.

62
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:39,143
We can't swing back to the right
'cause of that hill there.

63
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:41,603
That looks like the way
we'll have to go from here.

64
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:45,439
Yes, we'll put her right down
through there over that ridge.

65
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,291
Well, boys, the break is over.

66
00:07:52,615 --> 00:07:54,786
Don't just lay there getting a suntan.

67
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:57,052
Won't do you any good, anyhow!

68
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:01,283
Take that shovel and put
her to some good use!

69
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:10,334
What?

70
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:11,909
Don't do that now!

71
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:16,037
I have to.

72
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:20,003
Send a wire to the main office
and tell them I said... OW!

73
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:25,759
Send wire, main office,
tell them I said, "Ow". Gotcha.

74
00:08:32,614 --> 00:08:35,909
And right here, Mr. Lamarr, is
where we ran into quicksand.

75
00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:38,171
Quicksand. Splendid.

76
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:42,074
And so the railroad has got
to go through Rock Ridge.

77
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,477
Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge. Splendid.

78
00:08:45,253 --> 00:08:46,398
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

79
00:08:46,757 --> 00:08:48,732
Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge.

80
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,467
Be still, Taggart. Be still.

81
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:55,521
My mind is aglow with whirling,
transient nodes of thought...

82
00:08:55,844 --> 00:08:58,878
...careening through a
cosmic vapor of invention.

83
00:08:59,204 --> 00:08:59,836
Ditto!

84
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,329
Ditto? Ditto, you provincial putz!

85
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:08,088
I'm sorry, sir.

86
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:11,170
A plan. We need a plan.

87
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:13,692
What in the hell was that?

88
00:09:21,315 --> 00:09:22,875
We can't hear ourselves think!

89
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:31,004
Sorry, your Worship, but I've got
two men home sick with the flu...

90
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:33,535
...and it's utter chaos down here.

91
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:35,806
I'll try to keep it
as quiet as possible.

92
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:38,043
But as you can see...

93
00:09:40,802 --> 00:09:42,711
...this one is a doozey.

94
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:48,062
Yes, the Doctor Gillespie killings.
Well, do your best.

95
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:54,391
Now, let's see. Where were we?

96
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:55,649
Rock Ridge.

97
00:09:57,506 --> 00:10:00,735
Yes, when that railroad
goes through Rock Ridge...

98
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:04,090
...that land will be worth
millions, and I want it!

99
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:09,020
I want that land so badly,
I can taste it.

100
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,535
There must be a way.

101
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:16,730
Clumsy fool!

102
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:20,759
Wait a minute! There might
be a legal precedent.

103
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:25,439
Of course! Land-snatching!

104
00:10:25,472 --> 00:10:28,505
Land. La-land. "See 'Snatch'."

105
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:35,220
Haley vs. United States.
Haley, seven. United States, nothing.

106
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,169
You see, it can be done.
It can be done.

107
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:42,740
Unfortunately, there is one thing that
stands between me and that property.

108
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,348
The rightful owners.

109
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:47,865
There must be some way of scaring
them off, driving them out.

110
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:50,358
Getting rid of every human being
alive in that...

111
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:53,140
It's down the hall and to the left.

112
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:55,643
I've got it!

113
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:56,665
What? What?

114
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,768
I know how we can run
everybody out of Rock Ridge.

115
00:11:00,254 --> 00:11:03,549
We'll kill the first-born male
child in every household!

116
00:11:05,406 --> 00:11:06,682
Too Jewish.

117
00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:13,781
We'll work up a Number Six on them!

118
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:15,511
I'm afraid I'm not familiar
with that one.

119
00:11:15,614 --> 00:11:17,785
That's where we go
riding into town...

120
00:11:18,109 --> 00:11:19,865
...and a-whapping and a-whooping
every living thing...

121
00:11:19,964 --> 00:11:22,583
...that moves within an inch
of its life!

122
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:24,667
Except the women folks, of course.

123
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:25,937
You spare the women?

124
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:30,098
No, we rape the shit out of them
at the Number Six dance later on!

125
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:32,500
That's marvelous! That's so creative!

126
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:35,282
Why, Taggart, you've been hurt!

127
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,579
That uppity nigger hit me
on the head with a shovel.

128
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,126
I'd sure appreciate it, sir, if
you could find it in your heart...

129
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,321
...to hang him up by his
neck until he was dead.

130
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:48,080
Got him locked up downstairs.

131
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:50,483
Consider it done, stout fellow.

132
00:11:58,747 --> 00:12:00,689
I've got a special.
When can you work him in?

133
00:12:01,051 --> 00:12:05,207
I couldn't possibly fit him in
until Monday, sir. I'm booked solid.

134
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:06,960
Monday. Splendid.

135
00:12:12,762 --> 00:12:15,315
Thank you, sir.
And don't you worry.

136
00:12:15,706 --> 00:12:19,001
We'll make Rock Ridge
think it's a chicken...

137
00:12:19,162 --> 00:12:21,813
...that got caught in a tractor's nuts!

138
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:30,135
It's all right, Taggart. Just a man
and a horse being hung out there.

139
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:39,536
"There was a peaceful town
called Rock Ridge,

140
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:43,700
"...where people lived in harmony.

141
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:48,559
"They never had no kind of trouble.

142
00:12:50,264 --> 00:12:52,882
"There was no hint of misery.

143
00:12:58,968 --> 00:13:01,302
"The town saloon was always lively...

144
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:05,143
"...but never nasty or obscene.

145
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:08,980
"Behind the bar stood Anal Johnson.

146
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:12,397
"He always kept things nice and clean!

147
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:17,394
"And all at once the trouble started.

148
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,428
"A pack of murderers and thieves...

149
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:23,436
"...like swarms of locusts
they descended...

150
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:26,444
"...their aim to make
the townsfolk flee."

151
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,562
Well, that's the end of this suit!

152
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:06,515
Have you ever seen such cruelty?

153
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,609
"Now is a time of great decision.

154
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,009
"Are we to stay or up and quit?

155
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:26,601
"There's no avoiding this conclusion.

156
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:33,768
"Our town is turning into shit!"

157
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:44,232
Well, I don't have to tell you
good folks...

158
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:47,695
...what has been happening
here in our beloved town.

159
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:52,653
Sheriff murdered, crops burned...

160
00:14:53,138 --> 00:14:56,520
...stores looted, people stampeded...

161
00:14:56,882 --> 00:14:58,572
...and cattle raped!

162
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:05,194
Now the time has come to act.
And act fast!

163
00:15:08,401 --> 00:15:09,448
I'm leaving.

164
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:14,569
You get back here, you old
pious, candy-ass sidewinder!

165
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,794
There ain't no way that nobody
is going to leave this town!

166
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:24,009
Hell, I was born here
and I was raised here...

167
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:26,508
...and goddamn it,
I'm going to die here!

168
00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:30,279
And no sidewinder,
bushwhacking, hornswoggling...

169
00:15:30,608 --> 00:15:34,732
...cracker croaker, is going
to ruin my biscuit-cutter!

170
00:15:41,168 --> 00:15:42,990
Now who can argue with that?

171
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:48,651
I think we're all indebted
to Gabby Johnson...

172
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,756
...for clearly stating
what needed to be said.

173
00:15:52,655 --> 00:15:54,662
I'm particularly glad that
these lovely children...

174
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:56,424
...were here today to hear that speech.

175
00:15:57,038 --> 00:16:00,072
Not only was it authentic
frontier gibberish...

176
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:04,011
...it expressed a courage
little seen in this day and age!

177
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:07,212
What are we made of?

178
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:10,602
Our fathers came across the prairie...

179
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:14,567
...fought Indians, fought drought,
fought locusts, fought Dix!

180
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:18,406
Remember when Richard Dix came in here
and tried to take over this town?

181
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:20,966
Well, we didn't give up then...

182
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:25,383
...and by gum, we're not
going to give up now!

183
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:32,005
Olson Johnson is right!

184
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:37,349
What kind of people are we, anyhow?
I say we stay and fight it out!

185
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:42,919
Dr. Samuel Johnson is right about
Olson Johnson's being right.

186
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:45,066
And I'm not giving up
my ice cream parlor...

187
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:47,717
...that I built with these two hands
for nothing or nobody!

188
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:50,885
Howard Johnson is right!

189
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:58,916
Well, if we're going to stay, and
I think it's a big mistake...

190
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:04,170
...we're going to need a new sheriff.
Now, who is it going to be?

191
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:08,194
Why don't we wire the governor
to send us a sheriff?

192
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:10,662
Why should we get our own men killed?

193
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:14,410
Howard Johnson is right.
We'll wire the governor.

194
00:17:15,787 --> 00:17:19,910
Then let us pray for the deliverance
of our new sheriff.

195
00:17:20,554 --> 00:17:22,823
Will the congregation please rise?

196
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:28,899
I shall now read from the books
of Matthew, Mark, Luke...

197
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:32,318
...and duck!

198
00:17:42,153 --> 00:17:44,063
We've got to do something at once!

199
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:49,092
Governor, may I disturb
you for a moment, sir?

200
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:53,253
If you will just sign this, governor.
Right here.

201
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:54,917
Yes, what the hell is it?

202
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,550
Well, under the provisions
of this bill...

203
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,715
...we would snatch 200,000 acres
of Indian territory...

204
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:01,992
...which we have deemed unsafe
for their use at this time.

205
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:03,943
They're such children.

206
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:06,687
200,000 acres!
200,000 acres!

207
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,735
What will it cost, man?
What will it cost?

208
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,353
A box of these.

209
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:15,557
Are you crazy? They'll never go
for it, and then again they might.

210
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:18,367
The little red devils, they
love toys. May I try one?

211
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,690
These things are defective.

212
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,493
Right as usual, sir.

213
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:29,412
Show-off!

214
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:31,709
Just sign this, sir. Right here.

215
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,446
Okay, give us a hand here.

216
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:35,549
Work, work, work.

217
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,556
Hello, boys, have a good night's rest?
I missed you.

218
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:42,267
Just one more bill for you to sign, sir.

219
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,547
What is this?

220
00:18:43,814 --> 00:18:46,115
This is the bill that will convert
the State Hospital for the Insane...

221
00:18:46,438 --> 00:18:49,733
...into the William J. Le Petomane
Memorial Gambling Casino for the Insane.

222
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:50,850
Gentlemen, this...

223
00:18:51,174 --> 00:18:53,378
...this bill will be
a giant step forward...

224
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:55,649
...in the treatment
of the insane gambler.

225
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,563
Yes, bravo! Beautiful.

226
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:01,887
Thank you, Hedy. Thank you.

227
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:05,082
It's not Hedy. It's Hedley.
Hedley Lamarr.

228
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:07,617
What the hell are you worried about?

229
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:09,889
This is 1874.
You'll be able to sue her.

230
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:22,561
All right, help me in with this.

231
00:19:23,844 --> 00:19:25,120
Just, ah, think of your secretary.

232
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:27,359
Ah, that was a very good suggestion.

233
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:31,010
Okay, is that it? Anything else?

234
00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:33,468
Just this urgent telegram
from Rock Ridge.

235
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,004
It arrived last Friday.

236
00:19:36,387 --> 00:19:37,402
Read it, read it.

237
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:42,621
"Sheriff murdered. Church meeting
bombed. Reign of terror must cease.

238
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:44,482
"Send new sheriff immediately."

239
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:46,207
Holy underwear!

240
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:49,944
Sheriff murdered. Innocent women
and children blown to bits!

241
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,632
We've got to protect our
phony-baloney jobs, gentlemen.

242
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:56,155
We must do something about this
immediately, immediately, immediately!

243
00:19:59,202 --> 00:20:00,511
I didn't get a "hrumph" out of that guy!

244
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:01,946
Give the governor a "hrumph."

245
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:04,121
You watch your ass.

246
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,593
Gentlemen, please, rest your sphincters.

247
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:07,710
Well put.

248
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,906
As Attorney General, I can assure you...

249
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,551
...that a suitable sheriff will be found
to restore the peace in Rock Ridge.

250
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,158
Meeting is adjourned.

251
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,710
Oh, I am sorry, sir. I didn't mean
to overstep my bounds. You say that.

252
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:20,665
What?

253
00:20:20,993 --> 00:20:21,789
- Meeting is adjourned.
- It is?

254
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:23,741
No. You say that, governor.

255
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,341
- What?
- Meeting is adjourned.

256
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:26,041
It is?

257
00:20:26,273 --> 00:20:29,142
Here, play around with this for a while.
They are sweeping the country.

258
00:20:30,592 --> 00:20:32,218
Why don't you give these out
to some of the boys...

259
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,171
...in lieu of pay? Here you go.

260
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,901
And one for Miss Stein,
my beloved secretary.

261
00:20:39,232 --> 00:20:42,199
Play with these, boys,
in lieu of the other things.

262
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,141
This friggin' thing is warped.

263
00:20:47,136 --> 00:20:48,925
Why do I always get a warped one?

264
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:56,190
A sheriff! But law and order
is the last thing I want.

265
00:20:57,887 --> 00:21:02,360
Wait a minute. Maybe I could
turn this thing to my advantage.

266
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:07,799
If I could find a sheriff who so
offends the citizens of Rock Ridge...

267
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:11,060
...that his very appearance
would drive them out of town...

268
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:15,223
But where would I find such a man?

269
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,783
Why am I asking you?

270
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:31,031
Welcome to Hanging House.
Not to worry...

271
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,590
...everyone is equal in my eye.

272
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:52,533
Oh, not my ear!

273
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,274
Governor!

274
00:21:59,612 --> 00:22:00,757
Official business, sir.

275
00:22:01,116 --> 00:22:02,228
Is it important?

276
00:22:02,683 --> 00:22:03,960
It's very crucial.

277
00:22:05,244 --> 00:22:06,192
Be with you in a minute.

278
00:22:07,068 --> 00:22:08,977
Throw something on
and stay in that position.

279
00:22:11,483 --> 00:22:15,312
Forgive me, I was just, ah, walking
the parapet, taking a look around.

280
00:22:15,643 --> 00:22:16,472
What can I do for you?

281
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,071
Governor, as per your instructions...

282
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,724
...I'd like you to meet
the new sheriff of Rock Ridge.

283
00:22:21,403 --> 00:22:22,864
I'd be delighted... Wow!

284
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,106
I've got to talk to you. Come here.
Have you gone berserk?

285
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,723
Can't you see that man is a nig...

286
00:22:32,346 --> 00:22:35,029
Wrong person. Forgive me.
No offense intended.

287
00:22:36,698 --> 00:22:39,927
Have you gone berserk?
Can't you see that man is a nig?

288
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,654
Don't worry, sir.

289
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:44,146
Now, Hedley, I've always
trusted your judgment before...

290
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:46,356
...but haven't you taken a giant leap
away from your good senses?

291
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,661
Please, don't fly off the handle, sir.

292
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,062
I'm about to make you
an historic figure.

293
00:22:51,993 --> 00:22:54,229
Maybe even get you a cabinet post.

294
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:55,698
A cabinet post!

295
00:22:56,313 --> 00:22:57,142
Did you say that?

296
00:22:57,945 --> 00:22:58,741
Wonderful!

297
00:22:59,064 --> 00:23:03,090
Yes, the first man ever to appoint
a black sheriff! Just think, sir...

298
00:23:03,545 --> 00:23:04,690
...Washington, Jefferson...

299
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:05,616
...Lincoln.

300
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:06,992
Le Petomane!

301
00:23:08,056 --> 00:23:10,195
Sir, you have the seeds
of greatness in you.

302
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,462
Nurse them, caress them,
pour water on them.

303
00:23:14,072 --> 00:23:16,046
Don't short-change yourself, sir.

304
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,793
It will never work.
They'll kill him dead in one day!

305
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,179
One day is all we'll need to secure your
name in the annals of Western history.

306
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,959
And to get for you
a nomination for, dare I say?

307
00:23:27,384 --> 00:23:28,147
Dare, dare!

308
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:29,453
The Presidency!

309
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,788
Hail to the Chief!
Hail to the Chief!

310
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:43,311
"Four score and seven years ago...

311
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:46,638
"...our forefathers
brought forth on this..."

312
00:23:47,062 --> 00:23:48,010
Are you coming back?

313
00:23:48,342 --> 00:23:49,138
In a moment, dear.

314
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:54,351
Gentlemen, affairs of state must take
precedent over the affairs of state.

315
00:23:55,094 --> 00:23:56,500
Yes, of course, sir, we understand.

316
00:23:57,206 --> 00:23:58,253
Will you make all the arrangements?

317
00:23:58,581 --> 00:23:59,858
I will make all the arrangements.

318
00:24:00,118 --> 00:24:01,459
Especially the funeral.

319
00:24:03,254 --> 00:24:07,345
Good luck, good luck, boys.
Wonderful working with you. Good luck!

320
00:25:09,778 --> 00:25:12,811
Hurry up, get those flags up.
He'll be here soon.

321
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,464
I just got a telegram from
the governor's office.

322
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:18,315
The sheriff will be here at noon!

323
00:25:19,025 --> 00:25:22,374
Noon! I'd better rehearse my speech!

324
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:27,565
"As Honorary Chairman of
the Welcoming Committee...

325
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:32,361
"...it is my privilege to extend to you
a laurel and hearty handshake!"

326
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:34,987
Wonderful!

327
00:25:35,313 --> 00:25:36,109
Excellent!

328
00:25:37,073 --> 00:25:38,349
Can you see him yet?

329
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:44,357
The sheriff is coming!

330
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,784
Ring out the church bell!

331
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,029
Hey, the sheriff is a n...

332
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:08,012
What did he say?

333
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:09,742
The sheriff is near!

334
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:14,606
No, no, dag blame it, gol darn
it, the sheriff is a n...

335
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:37,993
As Chairman of the
Welcoming Committee...

336
00:26:38,285 --> 00:26:42,791
...it is my privilege to extend a laurel
and hearty handshake to our new...

337
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:47,687
...nigger.

338
00:27:15,756 --> 00:27:18,145
Excuse me while I whip this out.

339
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:26,212
"By the power vested in me by...

340
00:27:26,475 --> 00:27:29,672
"...the Honorable
William J. Le Petomane...

341
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:36,549
"...I hereby assume the duties...

342
00:27:36,715 --> 00:27:39,846
"...of the Office of Sheriff in and for
the Township of Rock Ridge."

343
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:43,362
Gentlemen, let us not allow anger
to rule the day.

344
00:27:43,818 --> 00:27:46,207
As your spiritual leader,
I implore you...

345
00:27:46,538 --> 00:27:48,807
...to pay heed to this good
book and what it has to say.

346
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:54,725
Son, you're on your own!

347
00:27:59,497 --> 00:28:00,196
Hold it!

348
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:03,554
The next man makes a move,
the nigger gets it!

349
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:10,562
Hold it, men. He's not bluffing.

350
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,639
Listen to him, men.
He's just crazy enough to do it.

351
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:17,190
Drop it! Or I swear I'll blow this
nigger's head all over this town!

352
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:23,299
Oh, Lordy, Lord, he's desperate!
Do what he say! Do what he say!

353
00:28:39,815 --> 00:28:42,270
Isn't anybody going to
help that poor man?

354
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:45,116
Hush, Harriet. That's a
sure way to get him killed.

355
00:28:46,823 --> 00:28:47,902
Help me, help me...

356
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:50,468
...somebody help me!

357
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,662
Shut up!

358
00:28:57,894 --> 00:29:02,204
Oh, baby, you are so talented.

359
00:29:02,727 --> 00:29:04,799
And they are so dumb!

360
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:13,914
Goddamn it!

361
00:29:14,246 --> 00:29:15,424
I said, "Order"!

362
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:21,182
You know, Nietzsche says,
"Out of chaos comes order."

363
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:23,391
Oh, blow it out your ass, Howard!

364
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:28,123
Now everyone be quiet...

365
00:29:28,965 --> 00:29:33,437
...whilst we listen to Harriet van
Johnson, our esteemed schoolmarm...

366
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:39,677
...as she reads a telegram that she
herself has composed to the governor...

367
00:29:41,252 --> 00:29:45,725
...expressing our feelings
about the new sheriff.

368
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:55,385
"To the Honorable William J.
Le Petomane, Governor."

369
00:29:55,716 --> 00:29:57,145
Louder! Speak up! We can't hear you!

370
00:29:59,108 --> 00:30:00,863
I'm not used to public speaking.

371
00:30:03,075 --> 00:30:07,548
"We, the white, God-fearing
citizens of Rock Ridge...

372
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:12,544
"...wish to express
our extreme displeasure...

373
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:14,776
"...with your choice of sheriff.

374
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:18,241
"Please remove him immediately.

375
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,646
"The fact that you
have sent him here..."

376
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:28,923
"...just goes to prove that you are
the leading asshole in the state."

377
00:30:52,193 --> 00:30:54,559
The drunk in number two must be awake.

378
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:01,438
Are we awake?

379
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:07,221
We're not sure.

380
00:31:08,608 --> 00:31:10,811
Are we black?

381
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,148
Yes, we are.

382
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:18,072
Then we're awake.
But we're very puzzled.

383
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:22,683
I think I better straighten myself out.

384
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:27,126
Need any help?

385
00:31:30,303 --> 00:31:31,579
All I can get.

386
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,397
That's okay. Sit down over here.

387
00:31:56,189 --> 00:31:58,098
Hey, maybe you should
eat something first.

388
00:31:58,621 --> 00:32:01,304
No, thanks. Food makes me sick.

389
00:32:10,557 --> 00:32:14,648
A man drinks like that and doesn't eat,
he is going to die.

390
00:32:17,244 --> 00:32:18,007
When?

391
00:32:21,244 --> 00:32:22,072
What's your name?

392
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,067
Well, my name is Jim,
but most people call me...

393
00:32:28,987 --> 00:32:29,718
...Jim.

394
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:36,058
Okay, Jim, since you are my
guest and I am your host...

395
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:39,030
...what is your pleasure?
What do you like to do?

396
00:32:39,803 --> 00:32:42,356
Oh, I don't know. Play chess...

397
00:32:44,347 --> 00:32:45,361
...screw.

398
00:32:46,683 --> 00:32:47,959
Well, let's play chess.

399
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:52,565
Checkmate.

400
00:32:55,578 --> 00:32:56,309
Checkmate.

401
00:32:56,954 --> 00:32:59,289
Why, you devious son-of-a-bitch!

402
00:33:00,122 --> 00:33:01,202
Happy days!

403
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:12,276
Man, why do you do that to yourself?

404
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:15,634
Oh, you don't really want to know that.

405
00:33:16,185 --> 00:33:17,046
I do, I do!

406
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:19,088
Well, if you must pry.

407
00:33:19,449 --> 00:33:20,528
I must, I must!

408
00:33:22,072 --> 00:33:24,625
I don't know if you ever
heard of me before, but...

409
00:33:25,497 --> 00:33:29,523
...I used to be called the Waco Kid.

410
00:33:31,032 --> 00:33:34,610
The Waco Kid. He had the
fastest hands in the West!

411
00:33:36,312 --> 00:33:37,490
In the world!

412
00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:40,624
Well, if you're the Kid,
then show me something.

413
00:33:42,296 --> 00:33:46,802
Maybe a couple of years ago I could
have shown you something, but today...

414
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,287
...look at that.

415
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:51,891
Steady as a rock.

416
00:33:52,471 --> 00:33:54,479
Yes, but I shoot with this hand.

417
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:59,472
See, I knew you weren't the Waco Kid.
You were just pulling my lariat.

418
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,891
See that king?

419
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,444
Put your hands on both sides of it.

420
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:26,635
Now when I say, "go,"
you try to grab it first.

421
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:30,292
Man, that's no contest.
You're a mile away.

422
00:34:34,325 --> 00:34:38,634
Anyway, when you hear the word
"go," you just try to grab it.

423
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:40,620
Ready?

424
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,096
You looking for this?

425
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,863
Well, raise my rent!
You are the Kid!

426
00:35:11,187 --> 00:35:14,089
Was. Yeah, I was the Kid.

427
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:17,808
What happened?

428
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:21,455
Well, it got so that every
piss-ant prairie punk...

429
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:23,661
...who thought he could
shoot a gun...

430
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,640
...would ride into town
to try out the Waco Kid.

431
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:32,622
I must have killed more men
than Cecil B. DeMille.

432
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,180
It got pretty gritty.

433
00:35:36,018 --> 00:35:38,570
I started to hear the
word "draw" in my sleep.

434
00:35:41,394 --> 00:35:42,408
Then one day...

435
00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:47,818
...I was just walking down the street
and I heard a voice behind me say...

436
00:35:49,777 --> 00:35:53,323
..."Reach for it, mister!"
I spun around.

437
00:35:55,793 --> 00:35:57,898
And there I was face to face...

438
00:36:00,272 --> 00:36:02,825
...with a 6-year-old kid!

439
00:36:07,088 --> 00:36:10,317
Well, I just threw my guns
down and walked away.

440
00:36:13,456 --> 00:36:16,172
The little bastard shot me in the ass!

441
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:23,399
So I limped to the nearest saloon,
crawled inside a whiskey bottle...

442
00:36:25,903 --> 00:36:27,529
...and I've been there ever since.

443
00:36:31,983 --> 00:36:32,682
Have a drink.

444
00:36:39,566 --> 00:36:44,039
Anyway, that's all ancient history.
Now you tell me your story.

445
00:36:44,398 --> 00:36:48,490
What's a dazzling urbanite like you
doing in a rustic setting like this?

446
00:36:49,742 --> 00:36:51,018
If you really must pry.

447
00:36:51,982 --> 00:36:53,444
I must, I must!

448
00:36:58,094 --> 00:37:00,647
Well, back in '56...

449
00:37:01,101 --> 00:37:04,614
...my folks and I were part
of this long wagon train...

450
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:06,114
...moving West.

451
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:21,289
Well, not exactly part of it.

452
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:26,148
You might say we were bringing up
the rear, when suddenly,

453
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,955
...from out of the West,
came the entire Sioux Nation!

454
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:34,059
And let me tell you, baby,
they were open for business!

455
00:37:37,996 --> 00:37:41,640
Naturally, the white folks
didn't let us travel in their circle...

456
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:43,106
...so we made our own.

457
00:38:18,249 --> 00:38:19,656
Shvartzes?

458
00:38:27,497 --> 00:38:30,147
Luzem gayen!

459
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,484
Cop a walk. It's all right.

460
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:37,509
Thank you.

461
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:41,667
Abi gezunt. Take off.

462
00:38:49,896 --> 00:38:52,067
They're darker than us!

463
00:38:55,431 --> 00:38:57,602
And the rest is history.

464
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:00,479
Impressed?

465
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:08,517
Always like to keep my audience riveted.

466
00:40:00,228 --> 00:40:01,723
How about some more beans,
Mr. Taggart?

467
00:40:02,052 --> 00:40:03,743
I'd say you've had enough!

468
00:40:07,556 --> 00:40:11,647
I understand there's a new sheriff
in town. Who wants to kill him?

469
00:40:18,051 --> 00:40:21,313
Why don't we give him to Mongo?

470
00:40:25,027 --> 00:40:26,936
Holy shit, that's too cruel!

471
00:40:28,003 --> 00:40:31,036
I'll be danged! That is a unique idea!

472
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:41,248
Down, boy, down, boy,
down, Mongo!

473
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:43,098
Hey, it's me. Taggart.

474
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:45,179
Here, smell. Smell.

475
00:40:48,961 --> 00:40:50,717
That's a good Mongo.

476
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:55,896
Hey, how about it? How would you
like to mutilate that new sheriff?

477
00:41:01,185 --> 00:41:02,297
Have a cigar.

478
00:41:41,503 --> 00:41:43,542
Oh, by the way,
I got a note this morning.

479
00:41:43,903 --> 00:41:44,699
From who?

480
00:41:45,023 --> 00:41:49,016
Well, I'm not sure.
It was addressed to the Deputy Spade.

481
00:41:53,118 --> 00:41:55,835
Well, once I establish
myself in this town...

482
00:41:56,158 --> 00:41:59,354
...Deputy Spade might turn
out to be a groovy position.

483
00:42:09,085 --> 00:42:11,987
Listen, Bart,
I want you to do me a favor.

484
00:42:13,181 --> 00:42:15,036
I don't want you going
out there this morning.

485
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:17,561
You can't win these people
over, no matter what you do.

486
00:42:17,918 --> 00:42:19,412
They're just not going to accept you.

487
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,530
I'm glad those fingers ain't loaded!

488
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,620
Just like old times.

489
00:42:41,756 --> 00:42:46,229
Like I told you, once you establish
yourself, they've got to accept you.

490
00:42:47,676 --> 00:42:48,624
Catch you later.

491
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:54,133
Good luck.

492
00:43:02,427 --> 00:43:03,376
Ah, good morning, ma'am.

493
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:07,088
And isn't it a lovely morning?

494
00:43:07,898 --> 00:43:09,272
Up yours, nigger!

495
00:43:13,754 --> 00:43:16,688
What did you expect?
"Welcome, sonny."

496
00:43:17,914 --> 00:43:19,256
"Make yourself at home."

497
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:25,171
"Marry my daughter." You've got to
remember these are just simple farmers.

498
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:28,694
These are people of the land.

499
00:43:29,658 --> 00:43:32,756
The common clay of the new West.

500
00:43:34,425 --> 00:43:35,407
You know.

501
00:43:37,497 --> 00:43:38,445
Morons!

502
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,022
What the hell is that?

503
00:43:58,776 --> 00:44:01,645
Mongo! Santa Mara!

504
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,782
I believe in it.
And if any one of you...

505
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,470
...friends and neighbors,
kind of gather around and...

506
00:44:08,056 --> 00:44:09,910
Holy shit!

507
00:44:14,871 --> 00:44:19,378
And they say that now in Paris,
France, even as we speak...

508
00:44:20,342 --> 00:44:23,539
...Louis Pasteur has devised
a new vaccine...

509
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,420
...that will obliterate anthrax
once and for all.

510
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,259
Hey, you can't park
that animal over there!

511
00:44:34,614 --> 00:44:35,661
It's illegal.

512
00:44:43,093 --> 00:44:47,403
Think of it, gentlemen. Hoof-and-
mouth disease a thing of the past!

513
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:51,476
Never mind that shit,
here comes Mongo!

514
00:44:57,493 --> 00:44:58,769
I don't know what it is.

515
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,507
Sheriff, Mongo's back!
He's breaking up the whole town!

516
00:45:07,573 --> 00:45:09,395
You've got to help us, please!

517
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,664
Did you hear that? Now it's "please."

518
00:45:11,988 --> 00:45:16,265
This morning I couldn't get the time
of day. Who is this Mongo, anyway?

519
00:45:16,596 --> 00:45:19,498
Well, Mongo ain't exactly a "who."
He's more of a "what."

520
00:45:19,956 --> 00:45:20,817
What he said.

521
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,187
Well, I don't know...

522
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:24,943
Oh, thank you very much!

523
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,269
The fool's going to...

524
00:45:29,139 --> 00:45:30,994
I mean, the sheriff's going to do it.

525
00:45:36,755 --> 00:45:40,846
No, no, don't do that! If you shoot
him, you'll just make him mad.

526
00:45:51,826 --> 00:45:53,103
Candygram for Mongo!

527
00:46:05,874 --> 00:46:06,506
Me, Mongo.

528
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:08,042
Sign, please.

529
00:46:18,545 --> 00:46:20,105
Mongo like candy.

530
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,902
A little further down, to the right.

531
00:46:29,648 --> 00:46:32,103
I thought sure that Mongo
would mash him up...

532
00:46:32,176 --> 00:46:34,085
...into little bitty sheriff meatballs.

533
00:46:34,768 --> 00:46:36,110
I just don't understand it.

534
00:46:36,432 --> 00:46:37,544
Be still, Taggart.

535
00:46:38,544 --> 00:46:41,064
My mind is a raging torrent...

536
00:46:41,392 --> 00:46:43,214
...flooded with rivulets of thought...

537
00:46:43,312 --> 00:46:46,508
...cascading into a waterfall
of creative alternatives.

538
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:49,798
Gol darn it, Mr. Lamarr...

539
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:53,420
...you use your tongue prettier
than a $20 whore.

540
00:46:58,478 --> 00:47:01,031
Wait a minute, that's it!

541
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:04,330
And it will work!

542
00:47:04,687 --> 00:47:07,076
You bet it will! What will work?

543
00:47:07,502 --> 00:47:08,931
Elementary, cactus-head!

544
00:47:09,262 --> 00:47:10,538
The beast has failed.

545
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:13,419
And when the beast fails,
it's time to call in beauty.

546
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,262
Beauty?

547
00:47:18,605 --> 00:47:21,704
She's never failed me before.
She'll turn him into jelly!

548
00:47:22,029 --> 00:47:23,938
She'll bring him to his knees!

549
00:47:26,381 --> 00:47:29,196
Where's my froggie?
Where's my froggie?

550
00:47:29,517 --> 00:47:31,557
I don't know.
I didn't see it when I came in.

551
00:47:31,885 --> 00:47:33,346
Damn your eyes, look for it!

552
00:47:41,101 --> 00:47:41,994
Oh, there it is.

553
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:52,039
That was a close one! Daddy loves
Froggie. Froggie love Daddy?

554
00:48:01,803 --> 00:48:03,297
I don't know how you did it.

555
00:48:03,787 --> 00:48:05,031
He was nothing.

556
00:48:05,355 --> 00:48:07,777
The bitch was inventing
the candygram.

557
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:10,239
They probably won't give me
credit for it.

558
00:48:19,178 --> 00:48:20,585
Good evening, sheriff.

559
00:48:20,906 --> 00:48:23,241
Sorry about the "Up yours, nigger."

560
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:27,142
I hope this apple pie will in some
small way say thank you for your...

561
00:48:27,466 --> 00:48:30,979
...ingenuity and courage in
defeating that horrible Mongo.

562
00:48:31,466 --> 00:48:33,855
Thank you. Much obliged.
Good night.

563
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:47,519
Of course, you'll have the good taste
not to mention that I spoke to you.

564
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:57,064
I'm rapidly becoming a big
underground success in this town.

565
00:48:57,384 --> 00:49:01,061
See, in another 25 years you'll be able
to shake their hands in broad daylight.

566
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:03,783
Well, I'm not going to
hold my breath for it.

567
00:49:04,136 --> 00:49:08,358
Come on, I don't want to be late.
Lili von Shtupp is opening tonight.

568
00:49:09,064 --> 00:49:10,340
Lili von who?

569
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:28,511
Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome.
Come on in.

570
00:49:33,383 --> 00:49:35,717
It's Hedley. For you, my dear.

571
00:49:37,094 --> 00:49:39,909
Oh, how ordinary.

572
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:46,339
Oh, Lili, Lili, Lili, legs, Lili, Lili!

573
00:49:47,942 --> 00:49:50,811
I can't find the words to
truly express my joy...

574
00:49:51,014 --> 00:49:52,989
...at the rekindling of our association.

575
00:49:53,734 --> 00:49:56,254
Bullshit, what's the job?

576
00:49:58,501 --> 00:50:00,094
I love it when you talk dirty.

577
00:50:12,196 --> 00:50:14,880
Come on, Lamarr, let's get down to
bwass tacks.

578
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:17,085
What do you want me to do?

579
00:50:18,628 --> 00:50:22,370
I want you to seduce and abandon
the sheriff of Rock Ridge.

580
00:50:22,948 --> 00:50:24,060
You think you can do it?

581
00:50:26,692 --> 00:50:28,098
Is Bismark a hewwing?

582
00:50:28,452 --> 00:50:31,452
Oh, Lili, you're magnificent! Kiss me!

583
00:50:43,203 --> 00:50:47,578
And now, folks, the gal
you've all been waiting for...

584
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:52,509
...the Bavarian Bombshell herself!
Let's hear it for Lili von Shtupp!

585
00:51:05,058 --> 00:51:08,254
"Here I stand, the goddess of desire...

586
00:51:08,898 --> 00:51:12,672
"...set men on fire.
I have this power.

587
00:51:14,401 --> 00:51:17,718
"Morning, noon and night,
it's drink and dancing...

588
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:22,682
"...some quick romancing,
and then a shower.

589
00:51:23,777 --> 00:51:27,126
"Stage door Johnnies
constantly surround me...

590
00:51:27,457 --> 00:51:30,806
"...they always hound
me with one request.

591
00:51:32,832 --> 00:51:35,799
"Who can satisfy their lustful habit?

592
00:51:36,672 --> 00:51:41,145
"I'm not a rabbit. I need some rest.

593
00:51:48,768 --> 00:51:50,294
"I'm tired...

00:51:51,712 --> 00:51:54,778

603
00:52:37,438 --> 00:52:39,347
"...and always too soon."

604
00:52:40,253 --> 00:52:41,530
Right, girls?

605
00:52:41,949 --> 00:52:46,421
"I'm tired.
Tired of playing the game.

606

00:52:52,893 --> 00:52:55,762

Goddamn it, I'm exhausted!

609
00:53:00,828 --> 00:53:03,130
Hello, cowboy, what's your name?

610
00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:07,001
"Tex ma'am"? Tell me, Tex ma'am...

611
00:53:07,324 --> 00:53:08,698
...are you in show business?

612
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:09,651
Nope.

613
00:53:09,883 --> 00:53:12,730
Well, then, why don't you get your
friggin' feet off the stage?

614
00:53:26,043 --> 00:53:30,516
Hello, handsome. Is that a 10-gallon
hat, or are you just enjoying the show?

615
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:41,945
Oh, Miss Lili, oh, my lovely lady!

616

of men again and again.

628
00:54:39,063 --> 00:54:41,037
"They sing the same tune!

629
00:54:42,007 --> 00:54:45,203
"They start with Byron and Shelley...

630
00:54:45,526 --> 00:54:49,519
"...then jump on your belly,
and bust your balloon.

631
00:54:56,086 --> 00:54:58,639
"Tired of playing the game.

632
00:55:00,277 --> 00:55:02,830
"Ain't it a friggin' shame?

633
00:55:04,662 --> 00:55:05,938
"I'm so..."

634
00:55:06,709 --> 00:55:11,216
Let's face it. Everything
below the waist is kaput!

635
00:55:45,043 --> 00:55:46,123
What does it say?

636
00:55:46,931 --> 00:55:51,209
"I must see you alone in my dwessing
woom right after the show."

637
00:56:05,747 --> 00:56:07,983
Wie gehts, meine schatzie?

638
00:56:08,914 --> 00:56:09,929
Faw out!

639
00:56:14,866 --> 00:56:18,062
A wed wose. How womantic!

640
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,035
Have a seat, shewiff.

641
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:28,296
Won't you excuse me for a moment...

642
00:56:28,465 --> 00:56:31,335
...while I slip into something
a little bit more comfortable?

643
00:56:34,545 --> 00:56:35,920
Bitte, baby.

644
00:56:43,121 --> 00:56:46,055
Why don't you loosen your bullets?

645
00:56:52,112 --> 00:56:54,567
Ahh, I feel wefweshed!

646
00:56:55,471 --> 00:56:57,381
Isn't it bwight in here?

647
00:57:03,536 --> 00:57:06,318
There! Isn't that better?

648
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,566
Pardon me, I'll be back in a moment.

649
00:57:14,479 --> 00:57:15,307
How is it going?

650
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:19,853
He's like wet sauerkraut in my hands.
By morning he will be my slave.

651
00:57:20,174 --> 00:57:20,905
Splendid.

652
00:57:21,423 --> 00:57:22,852
Oh, just let me have a little feel.

653
00:57:24,238 --> 00:57:26,377
Where were we? Where are you?

654
00:57:28,398 --> 00:57:30,471
Let me sit down next to you.

655
00:57:32,878 --> 00:57:34,154
Tell me, schatzie...

656
00:57:35,022 --> 00:57:39,277
...is it, ah, twu what they say
about the way you people are gifted?

657
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:44,743
Oh, it's twu, it's twu!

658
00:57:50,701 --> 00:57:52,708
Vill you care for
another schnitzengruben?

659
00:57:53,037 --> 00:57:56,931
No, thank you. Fifteen is my
limit on schnitzengruben.

660
00:57:57,741 --> 00:58:00,228
Well, then, how about a little?

661
00:58:03,596 --> 00:58:06,793
Baby, please, I am not from Havana.

662
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,969
Excuse me, honey...

663
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:13,032
...besides, I'm late for work.
I've got some heavy chores to do.

664
00:58:13,612 --> 00:58:16,165
Vill I, vill I see you later?

665
00:58:17,067 --> 00:58:21,224
That all depends on how much
Vitamin E I can get my hands on.

666
00:58:21,515 --> 00:58:22,693
Nein, nein, achtung!

667
00:58:23,435 --> 00:58:26,053
No, no, you mustn't go! I need you!

668
00:58:26,219 --> 00:58:29,088
I never met nobody like you!
I can't live without you!

669
00:58:31,818 --> 00:58:35,648
Please, you're making
a German spectacle of yourself.

670
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:39,652
Auf wiedersehen, baby.

671
00:58:46,634 --> 00:58:48,609
Oh, what a nice guy.

672
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:59,654
Oh, deary, dear.
Look what the cat dragged in.

673
00:59:12,392 --> 00:59:14,148
What's happening in the clean world?

674
00:59:14,985 --> 00:59:15,912
Bad news.

675
00:59:16,584 --> 00:59:20,774
I've got a writ here for Mongo's
release signed by Hedley Lamarr himself.

676
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,546
Why would a dude like
Hedley Lamarr care about Mongo?

677
00:59:31,496 --> 00:59:32,292
It's legal.

678
00:59:35,048 --> 00:59:38,309
Oh, those schnitzengrubens
can wipe you out!

679
00:59:45,543 --> 00:59:46,819
Wake up time!

680
00:59:52,871 --> 00:59:55,423
Okay, Mongo. You're free to go.

681
00:59:57,062 --> 00:59:58,077
Mongo no go.

682
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:04,155
Oh, come on, Mongo.
You're a free man.

683
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:10,366
Mongo stay with Sheriff Bart.
Sheriff first man ever whip Mongo.

684
01:00:12,102 --> 01:00:15,844
Mongo impressed, have deep
feelings for Sheriff Bart.

685
01:00:17,925 --> 01:00:19,998
Oh, you better watch out, big fella.

686
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:23,167
I think Mongo's taken
a little fancy to you.

687
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:28,606
Mongo straight.

688
01:00:33,284 --> 01:00:35,488
Maybe you know why a high-roller...

689
01:00:35,556 --> 01:00:37,760
...like Hedley Lamarr is interested
in Rock Ridge.

690
01:00:38,565 --> 01:00:42,623
Don't know. Got to do
with where choo-choo go.

691
01:00:45,988 --> 01:00:49,883
Mongo, why would Hedley Lamarr care
about where the choo-choo goes?

692
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:51,899
Don't know.

693
01:00:53,732 --> 01:00:57,758
Mongo only pawn in game of life.

694
01:01:01,412 --> 01:01:02,840
I think this might be a good time
to mosey out...

695
01:01:03,011 --> 01:01:05,248
...to where they're building
the railroad...

696
01:01:05,507 --> 01:01:07,100
...and maybe do a little snooping.

697
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,095
Damn, damn, damn!

698
01:01:53,441 --> 01:01:56,474
Hey, how are you doing Bart?
Get down off that horse!

699
01:02:02,336 --> 01:02:05,184
Oh, you shifty nigger!
They said you were hung!

700
01:02:05,504 --> 01:02:06,518
And they were right!

701
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:09,662
Look at that star, hoo-ee!
Civil service!

702
01:02:13,248 --> 01:02:14,677
Wait. Back off, scamp.

703
01:02:14,847 --> 01:02:17,717
You are addressing the duly appointed
sheriff of Rock Ridge.

704
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:21,372
Rock Ridge? Hey, the railroad
is going through there!

705
01:02:36,734 --> 01:02:39,996
Back up off your brother!
Don't mess up your brother!

706
01:02:56,862 --> 01:02:58,618
Holy mother of pearl!

707
01:02:59,453 --> 01:03:02,355
It's that nigger that hit me
on the head with the shovel!

708
01:03:03,101 --> 01:03:06,362
Now what the hell do you think you're
doing with that tin star, boy?

709
01:03:06,685 --> 01:03:11,157
Watch that "boy" shit, redneck! You're
talking to the sheriff of Rock Ridge.

710
01:03:13,596 --> 01:03:15,123
Well, now if that don't beat all!

711
01:03:15,932 --> 01:03:18,136
Here we take the good time
and trouble...

712
01:03:18,204 --> 01:03:20,440
...to slaughter every last Indian
in the West, and for what?

713
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:26,133
So they can appoint a sheriff
that's blacker than any Indian!

714
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:28,601
I am depressed.

715
01:03:29,051 --> 01:03:32,313
Excuse me, Mr. Taggart, sir, but I
sure do hate to see you like this.

716
01:03:32,635 --> 01:03:35,155
What if me and the boys were to
shoot that nigger dead?

717
01:03:35,227 --> 01:03:37,234
Would that pep you up some?

718
01:03:37,276 --> 01:03:38,323
Well, it might help.

719
01:03:38,715 --> 01:03:41,268
All right, boys. On the count of three.

720
01:03:41,979 --> 01:03:44,216
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

721
01:03:45,083 --> 01:03:46,676
Don't pay no attention to that alky.

722
01:03:46,842 --> 01:03:49,079
He can't even hold a gun,
much less shoot it.

723
01:03:52,123 --> 01:03:53,813
Like I said. On the count of three.

724
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:56,755
One...

725
01:03:58,970 --> 01:03:59,602
...two...

726
01:04:00,442 --> 01:04:01,074
...three!

727
01:04:12,377 --> 01:04:16,850
Well, just don't sit there looking
stupid, grasping your hands in pain.

728
01:04:17,657 --> 01:04:21,072
How about a little applause
for the Waco Kid?

729
01:04:31,737 --> 01:04:34,387
All right, I'm through being
Mr. Goodbar!

730
01:04:34,456 --> 01:04:37,140
The time has come to act
and act quickly!

731
01:04:37,272 --> 01:04:38,548
All my plans have backfired!

732
01:04:38,648 --> 01:04:40,884
Instead of the people leaving,
they're staying in droves!

733
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:45,069
Vhy don't you admit it?
He's too much of man for you. I know.

734
01:04:45,432 --> 01:04:47,188
You going to need an army to beat him!

735
01:04:47,735 --> 01:04:49,164
You're finished.

736
01:04:49,495 --> 01:04:53,968
Fertig! Fahrblunged! Fahrcocked!

737
01:05:00,183 --> 01:05:02,736
Shut up! You Teutonic twat!

738
01:05:04,086 --> 01:05:05,712
I must think.

739
01:05:13,942 --> 01:05:18,066
Wait a minute. She said army.
Of course!

740
01:05:18,646 --> 01:05:23,118
An army of the worst dregs ever
to soil the face of the West!

741
01:05:26,646 --> 01:05:30,802
I've decided to launch an attack that
will reduce Rock Ridge to ashes!

742
01:05:31,445 --> 01:05:32,722
What do you want me to do, sir?

743
01:05:33,141 --> 01:05:36,337
I want you to round up every vicious
criminal and gunslinger in the West.

744
01:05:36,437 --> 01:05:37,385
Take this down.

745
01:05:38,549 --> 01:05:42,771
I want rustlers, cutthroats,
murderers, bounty hunters...

746
01:05:43,092 --> 01:05:47,183
...desperados, mugs, pugs, thugs,
nitwits, half-wits, dimwits...

747
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:51,884
...vipers, snipers, con men,
Indian agents, Mexican bandits...

748
01:05:52,212 --> 01:05:55,343
...muggers, buggerers,
bushwackers, hornswagglers...

749
01:05:55,636 --> 01:05:59,345
...horse thieves, bull dykes, train
robbers, bank robbers, ass kickers...

750
01:05:59,476 --> 01:06:01,777
...shit kickers and Methodists!

751
01:06:04,244 --> 01:06:06,000
Could you repeat that, sir?

752
01:06:15,411 --> 01:06:16,688
Where's everybody going?

753
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:19,341
Read this.

754
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:33,033
Well, can't you see that's the
last act of a desperate man?

755
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:38,123
We don't care if it's the First Act of
Henry the Fifth! We're leaving!

756
01:06:39,186 --> 01:06:42,601
Now, wait a minute!
Wait just one doggoned minute!

757
01:06:43,825 --> 01:06:48,298
Just give me 24 hours to come up
with a brilliant idea to save our town.

758
01:06:48,849 --> 01:06:51,599
Just 24 hours, that's all I ask.

759
01:06:52,081 --> 01:06:53,128
No!

760
01:06:54,161 --> 01:06:56,016
You'd do it for Randolph Scott.

761
01:07:01,489 --> 01:07:04,271
All right, sheriff. 24 hours.

762
01:08:02,349 --> 01:08:03,015
Next!

763
01:08:04,494 --> 01:08:05,421
Qualifications?

764
01:08:05,933 --> 01:08:08,104
Rape, murder, arson and rape.

765
01:08:08,781 --> 01:08:10,025
You said rape twice.

766
01:08:10,925 --> 01:08:11,873
I like rape.

767
01:08:14,541 --> 01:08:16,843
Charming. Sign right here.

768
01:08:18,252 --> 01:08:19,529
Take that badge.

769
01:08:23,468 --> 01:08:24,362
Qualifications?

770
01:08:25,036 --> 01:08:28,036
Arson, armed robbery, mayhem.

771
01:08:28,397 --> 01:08:31,745
Wait a moment. What have
you got in your mouth?

772
01:08:34,732 --> 01:08:36,837
Nothing, eh? Lyle.

773
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:40,710
Gum!

774
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:43,875
Chewing gum on line, eh?

775
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,983
I hope you brought enough
for everybody.

776
01:08:48,811 --> 01:08:50,567
I didn't know there was
going to be so many.

777
01:08:55,883 --> 01:08:57,793
Boy, is he strict!

778
01:08:58,283 --> 01:09:00,901
We've got to get in there close
and find out what's happening.

779
01:09:02,699 --> 01:09:03,779
There's our ticket!

780
01:09:10,762 --> 01:09:11,809
Hey, boys!

781
01:09:13,386 --> 01:09:14,760
Look what I've got there!

782
01:09:16,842 --> 01:09:18,565
Hey, where are the white women at?

783
01:09:32,553 --> 01:09:34,244
Man, that was pretty! I liked that.

784
01:09:35,369 --> 01:09:39,013
Be ready to attack Rock Ridge at
noon tomorrow. Here's your badge.

785
01:09:42,665 --> 01:09:45,348
We don't need no stinkin' badges!

786
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,032
Next!

787
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:49,476
Qualifications?

788
01:09:50,216 --> 01:09:51,557
Stampeding cattle.

789
01:09:52,008 --> 01:09:53,437
That's not much of a crime.

790
01:09:53,768 --> 01:09:55,044
Through the Vatican!

791
01:09:55,528 --> 01:09:56,476
Kinky!

792
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:01,923
Why, Rhett, how many times
have I told you...

793
01:10:01,991 --> 01:10:04,195
...to wash up after
weekly cross-burning?

794
01:10:04,807 --> 01:10:05,887
See, it's coming off.

795
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:11,804
And now, for my next impression,
Jesse Owens!

796
01:10:13,511 --> 01:10:14,721
Catch them!

797
01:10:15,655 --> 01:10:19,877
Hold up, men,
we'll head them off at the pass!

798
01:10:21,126 --> 01:10:25,282
Head them off at the pass?
I hate that clich!

799
01:10:43,013 --> 01:10:44,028
Say, "hello."

800
01:10:44,517 --> 01:10:45,248
Hello.

801
01:10:46,277 --> 01:10:48,100
Listen to me, and listen to me good.

802
01:10:48,229 --> 01:10:50,465
I want you to get
all the brothers together...

803
01:10:50,789 --> 01:10:54,585
...round up all the lumber, canvas, paint
and nails you can lay your hands on...

804
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:59,390
...and meet me tonight 3 miles
due east of Rock Ridge at midnight.

805
01:11:00,165 --> 01:11:00,895
You understand?

806
01:11:01,572 --> 01:11:02,401
Say, "goodbye."

807
01:11:04,132 --> 01:11:05,277
Thanks a lot, brother.

808
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:36,089
All right, folks, I know you're a bit
confused wondering what you're doing...

809
01:11:36,162 --> 01:11:38,301
...out in the middle of the prairie
in the middle of the night.

810
01:11:38,434 --> 01:11:39,514
You bet your ass!

811
01:11:40,706 --> 01:11:41,633
I'm hip.

812
01:11:42,274 --> 01:11:43,801
Now, before the sun comes up...

813
01:11:44,098 --> 01:11:49,629
...we're going to build on this sight an
exact replica of the town of Rock Ridge.

814
01:11:52,514 --> 01:11:55,863
Every building, every storefront,
every rock and every tree...

815
01:11:56,194 --> 01:11:59,455
...right down to the orange roof
on Howard Johnson's outhouse.

816
01:12:00,993 --> 01:12:01,942
I get it!

817
01:12:02,273 --> 01:12:04,891
And tomorrow when Hedley Lamarr
and his men come riding in...

818
01:12:05,025 --> 01:12:06,170
...to destroy the real Rock Ridge...

819
01:12:06,305 --> 01:12:08,215
...they'll actually be destroying
the fake Rock Ridge!

820
01:12:08,289 --> 01:12:10,623
But they'll think
it's the real Rock Ridge!

821
01:12:10,689 --> 01:12:12,511
But we'll know it's the fake Rock Ridge!

822
01:12:12,832 --> 01:12:16,029
How're we going to do it? We don't
have the time nor the people.

823
01:12:16,353 --> 01:12:18,524
Wrong! There's why.

824
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,102
Who the hell are they?

825
01:12:26,816 --> 01:12:31,323
Railroad workers. They've agreed
to help us make our dream come true.

826
01:12:31,808 --> 01:12:34,175
And all they ask in return
is a little plot of land...

827
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:36,212
...they can call their own to homestead.

828
01:12:36,543 --> 01:12:37,623
What do you say?

829
01:12:44,767 --> 01:12:48,149
We'll give some land to the niggers
and the chinks...

830
01:12:48,767 --> 01:12:50,872
...but we don't want the Irish!

831
01:12:56,094 --> 01:12:57,141
No deal.

832
01:12:58,143 --> 01:13:01,558
Ah, prairie shit! Everybody!

833
01:13:06,174 --> 01:13:07,102
Oh, Lord...

834
01:13:08,286 --> 01:13:12,759
...do we have the strength to carry on
this mighty task in one night?

835
01:13:15,389 --> 01:13:17,626
Or are we just jerking off?

836
01:13:27,933 --> 01:13:32,406
Okay, okay, we have done it.
Now, let's see what we have done.

837
01:14:11,035 --> 01:14:15,507
Men, you are about to embark
on a great crusade...

838
01:14:16,474 --> 01:14:18,863
...to stamp out runaway
decency in the West.

839
01:14:19,546 --> 01:14:21,684
Now you will only
be risking your lives...

840
01:14:22,106 --> 01:14:26,481
...whilst I will be risking an almost
certain Academy Award nomination...

841
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:28,984
...for Best Supporting Actor.

842
01:14:29,849 --> 01:14:31,758
Now raise your right
hand for the pledge.

843
01:14:34,105 --> 01:14:34,966
Right!

844
01:14:36,729 --> 01:14:39,380
And repeat after me. I...

845
01:14:40,921 --> 01:14:41,848
...your name...

846
01:14:42,201 --> 01:14:43,445
...your name...

847
01:14:43,769 --> 01:14:46,703
Schmucks!
...pledge allegiance...

848
01:14:47,032 --> 01:14:48,309
...pledge allegiance...

849
01:14:48,665 --> 01:14:50,159
...to Hedley Lamarr...

850
01:14:50,489 --> 01:14:51,983
...to Hedy Lamarr...

851
01:14:52,313 --> 01:14:53,261
That's Hedley!

852
01:14:53,592 --> 01:14:54,737
...that's Hedley...

853
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,720
...and to the evil...

854
01:14:57,048 --> 01:14:58,477
...and to the evil...

855
01:14:58,808 --> 01:15:00,401
...for which he stands!

856
01:15:00,728 --> 01:15:02,069
...for which he stands!

857
01:15:02,424 --> 01:15:06,897
Now go do that voodoo
that you do so well!

858
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:22,162
Hold the happiness. We are in trouble.

859
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:25,877
Yep! We forgot one little detail.

860
01:15:26,103 --> 01:15:29,681
Nothing is missing. Everything is here,
down to the last hitching post.

861
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:32,302
People. There are no people.

862
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:34,965
Now don't panic. Don't panic.

863
01:15:35,702 --> 01:15:38,385
We just made a perfect copy
of Rock Ridge.

864
01:15:38,678 --> 01:15:41,994
Now all we've got to do is make
perfect copies of ourselves.

865
01:15:43,286 --> 01:15:45,358
But they'll be here in half an hour.

866
01:15:45,685 --> 01:15:47,758
Right, so we've got to
start working fast.

867
01:15:48,117 --> 01:15:51,695
You men start working on the dummies.
Jim and Mongo, come with me.

868
01:15:52,246 --> 01:15:55,758
I've got an idea that will
slow them down to a crawl.

869
01:15:56,085 --> 01:15:56,947
All right, let's go!

870
01:16:04,821 --> 01:16:06,730
Yeah, that's nice.

871
01:16:27,987 --> 01:16:32,460
Le Petomane Thruway! Now what
will that asshole think of next?

872
01:16:34,963 --> 01:16:36,872
Has anybody got a dime?

873
01:16:38,515 --> 01:16:41,548
Somebody's got to go back
and get a shit-load of dimes.

874
01:16:50,386 --> 01:16:54,161
Hurry up. Speed it up or we're
never going to get to Rock Ridge!

875
01:16:54,706 --> 01:16:57,356
Come on, move them through!

876
01:17:03,345 --> 01:17:05,200
Well, they're through the tollbooth.

877
01:17:07,601 --> 01:17:09,990
Look at this, they're buying it!

878
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,216
All right, here we go.
Hold your ears, folks!

879
01:17:23,664 --> 01:17:25,191
It's show time!

880
01:17:29,744 --> 01:17:30,540
Nothing!

881
01:17:30,864 --> 01:17:32,075
What are we going to do?

882
01:17:32,496 --> 01:17:35,659
Any minute now they're going to discover
the town is fake and pull out!

883
01:17:38,064 --> 01:17:40,485
You think you could squeeze off
a little shot from here...

884
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,469
...and set off the dynamite down there?

885
01:17:43,536 --> 01:17:44,812
I'll give it a try.

886
01:17:55,022 --> 01:17:58,219
Oh, Lord, keep this man's eye keen...

887
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:00,388
...and may God grant...

888
01:18:12,078 --> 01:18:13,256
It's a fake!

889
01:18:13,582 --> 01:18:15,109
We've been suckered in!

890
01:18:31,597 --> 01:18:34,893
Okay, folks, let's wipe them out!

891
01:18:58,476 --> 01:18:59,850
Forgive me, Lord!

892
01:20:00,424 --> 01:20:02,333
"Throw out your hands,
stick out your tush.

893
01:20:02,408 --> 01:20:04,318
"Hands on your hips,
give them a push.

894
01:20:04,616 --> 01:20:07,812
"You'll be surprised, you're doing
the French Mistake. Voil!"

895
01:20:10,375 --> 01:20:11,652
All right, cut!

896
01:20:16,551 --> 01:20:17,500
Wrong!

897
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:23,899
Just watch me. It's so simple!

898
01:20:24,231 --> 01:20:25,507
You sissy Marys!

899
01:20:26,151 --> 01:20:30,341
Give me the playback.
And watch me, faggots!

900
01:20:43,174 --> 01:20:44,068
Have you got it?

901
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:45,568
Yessssssss.

902
01:20:46,502 --> 01:20:48,127
Sounds like steam escaping!

903
01:20:48,646 --> 01:20:51,679
Action! Okay, wait until I get out.

904
01:21:21,188 --> 01:21:24,963
Cut! What in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

905
01:21:25,284 --> 01:21:27,106
This is a closed set!

906
01:21:28,131 --> 01:21:30,684
Piss on you!
I'm working for Mel Brooks.

907
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:32,866
Not in the face!

908
01:21:34,724 --> 01:21:35,617
Thank you.

909
01:21:36,131 --> 01:21:38,979
They've hit Buddy!
Come on, girls!

910
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:49,883
You vulgar shit!

911
01:21:50,307 --> 01:21:52,860
Why, you miserable pansy!

912
01:21:57,379 --> 01:21:58,939
I'm parked over by the commissary.

913
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:06,967
You brute, you brute,
you vicious brute!

914
01:22:08,642 --> 01:22:10,551
All right, all right...

915
01:22:24,897 --> 01:22:26,490
How many days do you have left, Joey?

916
01:22:26,849 --> 01:22:29,215
They lose me right
after the bunker scene.

917
01:22:31,681 --> 01:22:32,728
What the hell is that?

918
01:22:38,272 --> 01:22:41,054
Get your pies for the great pie fight!

919
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,902
This is our Studio commissary
where some Hollywood stars...

920
01:22:47,968 --> 01:22:49,593
...come to eat. Keep in line.

921
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,287
And now we'll go to the
Special Effects Department.

922
01:23:03,999 --> 01:23:07,065
Yankee bean soup, cole slaw
and tuna surprise.

923
01:23:45,853 --> 01:23:46,802
Taxi!

924
01:23:52,028 --> 01:23:53,522
Drive me off this picture!

925
01:24:21,755 --> 01:24:22,802
You dropped your beads.

926
01:24:23,131 --> 01:24:24,080
One, please.

927
01:24:25,851 --> 01:24:27,127
Uh, student.

928
01:24:27,611 --> 01:24:28,559
Are you kidding?

929
01:24:31,034 --> 01:24:32,147
Pain in the ass.

930
01:24:32,762 --> 01:24:34,999
Look, Herman,
I'm in Hedy Lamarr's shoes!

931
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:36,086
Hedley!

932
01:25:03,993 --> 01:25:04,789
Freeze it!

933
01:25:05,753 --> 01:25:07,924
Okay, Lamarr, go for your gun.

934
01:25:08,249 --> 01:25:11,183
Wait, wait, I'm unarmed.

935
01:25:11,672 --> 01:25:14,487
All right, we'll settle it like men.

936
01:25:15,993 --> 01:25:16,920
With our fists.

937
01:25:18,232 --> 01:25:21,876
Sorry, I just remembered. I am armed.

938
01:25:29,143 --> 01:25:33,616
How did he do such fantastic stunts
with such little feet?

939
01:25:39,351 --> 01:25:40,944
You shot the bad guy!

940
01:25:43,382 --> 01:25:44,789
Well, what do you want to do now?

941
01:25:45,462 --> 01:25:47,699
Come on, let's check out
the end of the flick.

942
01:25:48,567 --> 01:25:51,217
I sure hope there's a happy ending.
I love a happy ending.

943
01:25:56,566 --> 01:25:59,500
Sheriff, you can't go now.
We need you.

944
01:26:00,182 --> 01:26:03,597
My work here is done.
I'm needed elsewhere now.

945
01:26:04,342 --> 01:26:07,189
I'm needed wherever
outlaws rule the West.

946
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:11,339
Wherever innocent women and children
are afraid to walk the streets.

947
01:26:11,989 --> 01:26:14,640
Wherever a man cannot
live in simple dignity.

948
01:26:14,965 --> 01:26:18,543
Wherever people cry out for justice.

949
01:26:19,349 --> 01:26:20,626
Bullshit!

950
01:26:23,317 --> 01:26:24,593
All right, you caught me.

951
01:26:24,693 --> 01:26:27,791
To speak the plain truth, it's getting
pretty damn dull around here.

952
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,599
Good luck, Bart, and God bless you.

953
01:26:36,628 --> 01:26:37,905
'Bye, baby brother.

954
01:26:39,956 --> 01:26:41,582
Keep the faith, brothers!

955
01:26:57,394 --> 01:26:58,823
Where are you headed, cowboy?

956
01:27:00,243 --> 01:27:01,355
Nowhere special.

957
01:27:04,243 --> 01:27:08,715
Nowhere special.
I always wanted to go there.

958
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:11,373
Come on!
