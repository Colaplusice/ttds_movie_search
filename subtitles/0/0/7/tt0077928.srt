Its a frisbee.

10
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:29,219
You throw it and catch it.
Its a game.

11
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:32,935
A game ...

12
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:25,541

00:10:19,026 --> 00:10:22,985

00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:30,659
Yes, American. United States.

00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:33,386
American.

00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:50,304

32
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:56,905

33
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:38,655
Howdy, BiIIy.
How are you doing? Okay?

34
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:47,135
I think these gentIemen
have finished for the time being.

35
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:51,060
If youd Iike
to put your cIothes on.

36
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,944
The officer wants to know
if youre afraid.

37
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:19,223
No, Im not afraid.

38
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:36,660
The officer said
theres nothing to be afraid of.

39
00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:40,580
Co-operate,
and youII be on the pIane home.

40
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:54,615
- Where did you get the hashish?
- From a cab driver.

41
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:57,664
In the pIaying shop at the bazaar.

42
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:15,823
- WouId you recognise him again?
- I think so.

43
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:25,698
You decided to fIy at a bad time.

44
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:31,259
GuerriIIas aII over the pIace,
bIowing up pIanes ...

45
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:36,022
Four pIanes in four days.
Dont you read the newspapers?

46
00:14:36,186 --> 00:14:40,179
Theres been a shit storm
over the fIow of heroin from Turkey.

47
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:44,055
- I didnt have heroin.
- A drug is a drug.

48
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:48,663
It was my first time.
It was onIy two kiIos.

49
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:52,216
It doesnt matter
if it was 2 or 200 kiIos.

50
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:56,504
Catching you shows the worId
Turkey is fighting the drug trade.

51
00:14:56,666 --> 00:15:02,024
- Are you with the ConsuIate?
- Something Iike that. Cigarette?

52
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:07,542
- What did you pay this cab driver?
- $200. My Iast 200.

53
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:11,938
- How much did you figure to make?
- Id onIy seII it to my friends.

54
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:16,099
- Im not a pusher. Honest.
- It beats working.

55
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:21,386
- Have you got a famiIy?
- Mother, father, brother, sister.

56
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:25,459
- Long IsIand.
- ItII be tough on them.

57
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:29,778
- GirIfriend?
- Yeah, she was on the pIane.

58
00:15:32,106 --> 00:15:38,739
- She didnt know anything about it.
- Lucky girI.

59
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:43,422
- She used to say I was Iucky.
- Lets hope so, BiIIy.

60
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:47,264
You seem Iike a nice enough kid.

61
00:19:47,426 --> 00:19:52,295
But you try it,
and III bIow your brains out.

62
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:26,699
Mom and Dad, this is the hardest
letter l've ever had to write.

63
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:33,101
l hoped to get out of this quickly,
so you'd never know about it.

64
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:39,375
But thatjust isn't possible now.
l don't know what's going to happen.

65
00:20:39,546 --> 00:20:43,744
What can l say to you?
Will "l'm sorry" make a difference?

66
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:48,696
Will it ease the pain,
the shame you must be feeling?

67
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:52,142
Forgive me, please.

68
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:09,903
CouId I have a bIanket?

69
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:13,422
Its coId.
CouId I have a bIanket?

70
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:19,582
- A bIanket!
- Too Iate. Tomorrow.

71
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:26,697
HeII be here tomorrow, I think.
Goodnight.

72
00:22:00,226 --> 00:22:04,299
- Can you speak EngIish?
- Your ceII is open.

73
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:08,664
BIankets, three ceIIs down.
You get me one.

74
00:23:23,626 --> 00:23:26,060
I needed a bIanket.

75
00:23:28,946 --> 00:23:31,824
WiIIiam Hayes.

76
00:23:46,506 --> 00:23:49,543
I needed a bIanket, I was coId!

77
00:25:01,906 --> 00:25:04,215
Jesus ...

78
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:07,503
Come on, you must stand.

79
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:12,260
Youd better waIk around,
or your feet wiII sweII up.

80
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:19,298
- Youve got to be crazy.
- We aII are. Smoke some of this.

81
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:26,460
Youve been out for days,
taIking aII kinds of shit.

82
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:30,016
- How does it feeI?
- About as good as it Iooks.

83
00:25:30,186 --> 00:25:37,297
Gecmis olsun. Its Turkish.
It means, May it pass quickIy.

84
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:42,705
- It Iooks Iike a cheap hoteI.
- The room service is Iousy.

85
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:46,984
Im Jimmy Booth.
This is Erich ... something Swedish.

86
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:50,104

- He cIeaned you up.

87
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:54,657
Thanks. Im BiIIy Hayes ...
at Ieast I used to be.

88
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:35,539
- Why peacocks?
- They use them instead of dogs.

89
00:26:35,706 --> 00:26:42,100
They scream Iike mad if theyre
disturbed and they dont get rabies.

90
00:26:43,146 --> 00:26:48,220
- Who are the kids?
- LittIe fuckers ...

91
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:52,777
Thieves, rapists, murderers ...
You name it, they do it.

92
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:56,859
Dont trust any of them.
They teII Rifki everything.

93
00:26:57,026 --> 00:27:00,177
Hes the squeaI around here.
He seIIs tea, -

00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:09,015

96
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:13,304
- Where?

00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:19,382
Thats heavy.
This aint the good oId USA.

98
00:27:19,546 --> 00:27:23,175
In Turkey, its a fucking accident
if youre innocent.

99
00:27:23,346 --> 00:27:27,817
- Nobody here is innocent.
- Dont pay too much attention.

100
00:27:27,986 --> 00:27:33,379
Anything is possibIe in Turkey.
They may not hit you for smuggIing.

101
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:37,425
If they make it possession,
you might even get baiI.

102
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:42,740
If you make baiI, youre free.
Sneak across the border to Greece.

103
00:27:42,906 --> 00:27:48,697
Sure, keep dreaming.
See where it gets you. Like Max.

104
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:53,018
Its going to be a whiIe
before you taste a hamburger again.

105
00:27:53,186 --> 00:27:57,498
- You broke the Iaw.
- The Iaw is sometimes wrong.

106
00:27:57,666 --> 00:28:00,464
The Iaw is never wrong!

107
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:05,056
The fucking Iaw is.

108
00:28:12,426 --> 00:28:16,260
- PeopIe get on his nerves.
- Whats he in for?

109
00:28:16,426 --> 00:28:19,224

110
00:28:19,386 --> 00:28:22,537
- What did he steaI?
- Two candIesticks.

111
00:28:22,706 --> 00:28:25,857
- Thats aII?

112
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:30,816
He was in for a year and a haIf
before he even toId his parents.

113
00:28:30,986 --> 00:28:36,185
- What about you?
- Hashish, Iike most foreigners.

114
00:28:36,346 --> 00:28:40,862
- What did they give you?
- 1 2 years. I had 1 00 grams.

115
00:28:41,026 --> 00:28:47,022
Youve got to get a good Iawyer.
TaIk to the EngIishman. Max.

116
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:50,895
Hes been in the Iongest.
Seven years.

117
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:11,744
Gastro. Stomach medicine.

118
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:18,335
Its got codeine in it.
Its the best I can do around here.

119
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,781
Max ...

120
00:29:20,946 --> 00:29:24,985
- Lawyers ..?
- Oh, yeah.

121
00:29:26,106 --> 00:29:30,019
Theres no straight Iawyers
in Turkey.

122
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:33,656
Theyre aII bent.

123
00:29:33,826 --> 00:29:38,900
Bent as hairpins.
OccupationaI necessity.

124
00:29:39,066 --> 00:29:43,662
They have speciaI cIasses
in corruption at night schooI.

125
00:29:44,986 --> 00:29:48,661
If youre suspected of honesty,
youre disbarred.

126
00:29:53,586 --> 00:29:57,943
I knew a Iawyer feIIow once.

127
00:29:58,106 --> 00:30:02,577
He got that Frenchman off.
La Roche.

128
00:30:05,786 --> 00:30:08,778
A big smuggIer.

129
00:30:08,946 --> 00:30:12,143
200 kiIos.

130
00:30:13,506 --> 00:30:18,022
He put enough bread
in enough pockets. Got baiI.

131
00:30:18,186 --> 00:30:21,656
Vanished.

132
00:30:21,826 --> 00:30:26,502
- His name?
- Who?

133
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:31,865
- The Iawyer.
- Lawyer?

134
00:30:32,026 --> 00:30:36,542
Who got the Frenchman off.

135
00:30:38,346 --> 00:30:43,943
YesiI is his name.

136
00:30:45,746 --> 00:30:49,580
I dont know anything eIse
about him.

137
00:30:49,746 --> 00:30:53,022
YesiI.

138
00:30:54,826 --> 00:30:59,616
The best thing to do
is get your ass out of here.

139
00:30:59,786 --> 00:31:04,018
- Yeah, but how?
- Catch the midnight express.

140
00:31:04,186 --> 00:31:07,223
Whats that?

141
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:18,461
Its not a train.
Its a prison word for ... escape.

142
00:31:22,946 --> 00:31:25,904
It doesnt stop around here.

143
00:32:10,986 --> 00:32:13,784
Dad, Im sorry.

144
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:17,018
Forget it.

145
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:23,705
III punch you in the nose Iater.
Weve got to get you out of here.

146
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:28,382
This is a suit I brought for you.

147
00:32:29,586 --> 00:32:32,976
Smarten you up a IittIe.

148
00:32:35,906 --> 00:32:39,945
- Are you aII right?
- Yeah.

149
00:32:40,106 --> 00:32:43,337
Hows Mom?

150
00:32:43,506 --> 00:32:47,340
WeII, shes bad.

151
00:32:47,506 --> 00:32:52,136
She couIdnt make the trip.
You know Mom. Her boy ...

152
00:32:54,866 --> 00:32:58,415
Susan toId us

153
00:32:58,586 --> 00:33:01,658
Shes saving to come back here ...

154
00:33:01,826 --> 00:33:07,264
Dont Iet her come.
Hows Rob? Hows Peg?

155
00:33:07,426 --> 00:33:10,577
Theyre the same. You know.

156
00:33:10,746 --> 00:33:15,740
We toId the neighbours
you were in hospitaI in Europe.

157
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:22,141
This is StanIey DanieIs.
Hes the American ConsuI here.

158
00:33:22,306 --> 00:33:29,781
BiIIy, were going to do everything
in our power to get you out of here.

159
00:33:29,946 --> 00:33:36,579
Thats Necdit YesiI,
the Iawyer you asked for.

160
00:33:36,746 --> 00:33:40,739
I know exactIy what you feeI,
but you must not worry.

161
00:33:40,906 --> 00:33:44,945
WeII get the right court
and the right judge.

162
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,416
III arrange everything, just right.

163
00:33:49,786 --> 00:33:55,941
I understand that if you get baiI,
its easy to get across the border.

164
00:33:56,106 --> 00:34:02,215
Thats what were shooting for.
Ive spoken to the State Department.

165
00:34:02,386 --> 00:34:07,460
Right now, reIations with the Turks
arent too good. Nixon upset them.

166
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:13,656
- Our best bet is right here.
- Dad, III pay you back for this.

167
00:34:13,826 --> 00:34:18,024
Money doesnt matter, BiIIy.
Not at this stage.

168
00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:29,497
- Where did you get that Iimp?
- I twisted my ankIe.

169
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:34,456
- Where are you staying?
- The HiIton.

170
00:34:34,626 --> 00:34:39,905
- How do you Iike IstanbuI?
- Interesting pIace.

171
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:45,299
The food is Iousy. The crap
they seII in the restaurants ...

172
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:50,460
I had to run to the toiIet.
You shouId have seen the toiIet.

173
00:34:50,626 --> 00:34:57,702
III eat at the HiIton every night.
Steak, French fries and ketchup.

174
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:07,823
BiIIy ...

175
00:35:07,986 --> 00:35:14,061
- Why did you do it?
- Money.

176
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:18,861
I know you kids smoke that stuff
and we drink booze, -

177
00:35:19,026 --> 00:35:23,144
- but taking it across the border,
thats stupid.

178
00:35:23,306 --> 00:35:25,661
I know.

179
00:35:25,826 --> 00:35:31,423
Dad ... get me out of here.

180
00:35:31,586 --> 00:35:36,216
I promise you. Just sit tight.

181
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:41,096
Let me work with Mr. DanieIs
and Mr. YesiI here.

182
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:44,383
WeII get you out, okay?

183
00:35:44,546 --> 00:35:48,334
Hey, BiIIy ... Okay?

184
00:35:50,986 --> 00:35:53,341
Okay.

185
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:34,298
- What did that prosecutor say?
- Its not important.

186
00:37:34,466 --> 00:37:39,586
We made our case. You spoke weII.
The judge Iiked you.

187
00:37:57,826 --> 00:38:01,455
Mr. Hayes, the judge is coming back.

188
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:45,945
- Four years, two months.
- Four years?

189
00:38:46,106 --> 00:38:48,097
WeII appeaI.

190
00:38:48,266 --> 00:38:54,102
ItII be reduced for good behaviour.
It is onIy for possession.

191
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:58,942
The prosecutor wanted
a Iife sentence for smuggIing.

192
00:38:59,106 --> 00:39:04,419
To be honest, Mr. Hayes,
it is a great victory.

193
00:39:14,346 --> 00:39:20,501
With good time,
it works out to about three years.

194
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:23,703
And then theres the appeaI.

195
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:31,944
DanieIs and YesiI
are aII working for you.

196
00:39:32,106 --> 00:39:35,735
Were trying to get you transferred.

197
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:41,538
DanieIs thinks there might be
a poIiticaI amnesty any month now.

198
00:39:45,026 --> 00:39:48,780
AII right, BiIIy ...

199
00:39:48,946 --> 00:39:54,384
I know it sounds tough,
but we are going to get you out.

200
00:39:54,546 --> 00:39:59,666
I promise you.
Dont do anything stupid.

201
00:39:59,826 --> 00:40:03,375
They couId pIay with your sentence.

202
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:08,178
AII right, now ...

203
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:16,781
Im putting $500 in the bank.
Anything you need, you write.

204
00:40:16,946 --> 00:40:21,940
Theres food here,
candy, writing paper, -

205
00:40:22,106 --> 00:40:29,137
- books, cigarettes, soap,
toothbrush ...

206
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:37,298
Ive soId insurance for 30 years.

207
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:40,936
Now Ive got to see my own son ...

208
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:45,463
Jesus!

209
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:55,938
If I couId be where you are ...
Id be there.

210
00:40:58,586 --> 00:41:02,056
I Iove you, Dad.

211
00:41:30,586 --> 00:41:34,898
You take good care of my boy,
or III have your fucking head!

212
00:43:04,066 --> 00:43:09,982
Dear Susan,
1970 has now passed into 1971.

213
00:43:10,146 --> 00:43:13,980
You can drift in here
and never know you're gone.

214
00:43:14,146 --> 00:43:20,142
You can fade so far out, you
don't know where you are anymore.

215
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:28,384
l find loneliness is a physical pain
that hurts all over.

216
00:43:58,506 --> 00:44:01,657
To the Turks
everything is "syle byle".

217
00:44:01,826 --> 00:44:05,614
lt means "like this, like that. "
You never know what will happen.

218
00:44:07,306 --> 00:44:11,458
All foreigners are "ayip. "
They're considered dirty.

219
00:44:11,626 --> 00:44:16,575
So is homosexuality, but they
do it every chance they get.

220
00:44:16,746 --> 00:44:21,183
There are about 1,000 things
that are "ayip".

221
00:44:21,346 --> 00:44:26,374
You can stab or shoot somebody
below the waist but not above.

222
00:44:27,506 --> 00:44:32,580
Stabbing somebody in the ass
is considered Turkish revenge.

223
00:44:34,946 --> 00:44:39,861
l know it must sound crazy to you,
but this place is crazy.

224
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:49,502
One day,
one of the new kids was raped.

225
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:53,898
So they picked out
four of the worst kids.

226
00:46:21,026 --> 00:46:25,497
Then there's Rifki. The more
l know of him, the more l hate him.

227
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:29,375
$1 0 for this shit? You pig.

228
00:46:29,546 --> 00:46:33,016
There are no pigs in Turkey.

229
00:46:33,186 --> 00:46:39,056
- This shit is shit.
- No, its good. Good shit.

230
00:46:39,226 --> 00:46:43,060
- You big shit.
- Yeah, me big shit.

231
00:47:01,506 --> 00:47:04,498
You asshoIe.

232
00:47:08,706 --> 00:47:13,177
What is it with you?
Just what the heII is it, man?

233
00:47:16,106 --> 00:47:19,815
You dont fuck with me,
I dont fuck with you.

234
00:47:19,986 --> 00:47:23,820
You fuck with me aII the time.
You make crummy tea.

235
00:47:23,986 --> 00:47:30,744
- You rip us off on the hash.
- I make speciaI tea for you.

236
00:47:30,906 --> 00:47:35,616
We have to Iive Iike brothers.
We have to be in here together.

237
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:39,461
For aII the money youve got,
youve got nothing.

238
00:47:39,626 --> 00:47:44,302
- You are American, you dont know.
- Know what?

239
00:47:44,466 --> 00:47:46,536
Dog eat dog.

240
00:47:46,706 --> 00:47:50,779
You fuck other man before he
fucks you. And you must fuck Iast.

241
00:47:58,866 --> 00:48:02,654
Come on down.

242
00:48:08,186 --> 00:48:14,739
Egbert ...
Sodding cat.

243
00:50:38,826 --> 00:50:41,021
WiIIiam!

244
00:50:41,186 --> 00:50:45,418
Are you aII right?

245
00:50:45,586 --> 00:50:50,057
The new American Ambassador
is foIIowing your case.

246
00:50:50,226 --> 00:50:54,856
He says there is progress.
You want a cigarette?

247
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:58,578
But there is another route ...

248
00:51:00,546 --> 00:51:03,663
... that is quite possibIe.

249
00:51:03,826 --> 00:51:07,296
For a proper amount of money,
it is possibIe -

250
00:51:07,466 --> 00:51:12,017
- to convince the ten officiaIs
to Iose track of your papers -

251
00:51:12,186 --> 00:51:16,737
- before the High Court in Ankara
confirms your sentence.

252
00:51:16,906 --> 00:51:24,779
And you couId be in Greece by
the time they discover the mistake.

253
00:51:27,266 --> 00:51:34,581
But I have to act before the
officiaI sentence is handed down.

254
00:51:35,946 --> 00:51:42,818
And for that
I must pay certain officiaIs.

255
00:51:54,626 --> 00:51:56,856
Whats that?

256
00:52:03,106 --> 00:52:07,816
The bIueprints to the prison, man.

257
00:52:07,986 --> 00:52:13,856
There was this German architect
in the hospitaI.

258
00:52:14,026 --> 00:52:16,699
He Iet me copy them.

259
00:52:16,866 --> 00:52:20,745
Its too bad
you didnt have a Xerox machine.

260
00:52:22,106 --> 00:52:24,984
There are two ways out of here.

261
00:52:25,146 --> 00:52:30,015
One is over the roof,
but thats kind of risky.

262
00:52:30,186 --> 00:52:35,783
The other way, III need your heIp,
and that is under.

263
00:52:38,426 --> 00:52:40,621
A tunneI?

264
00:52:40,786 --> 00:52:46,418
- Are you serious?
- This is not StaIag 1 7.

265
00:52:46,586 --> 00:52:51,535
Thats where youre wrong.
The tunneI is aIready buiIt.

266
00:52:51,706 --> 00:52:55,619
Theres a basement
where they used to keep weapons.

267
00:52:55,786 --> 00:53:02,464
Beneath that are the catacombs the
Christians buiIt to bury their dead.

268
00:53:02,626 --> 00:53:07,063
Were sitting
right on top of it ... here.

269
00:53:08,066 --> 00:53:13,584
The kraut says that theres
a bunch of hoIIow shafts.

270
00:53:13,746 --> 00:53:17,944
Theyre Iike dumbwaiters,
aII aIong these waIIs.

271
00:53:18,106 --> 00:53:21,940
One of them
is right next to our shower.

272
00:53:22,106 --> 00:53:25,655
If we get in there,
we can get down into the catacombs.

273
00:53:25,826 --> 00:53:29,614
With three of us working,
it shouIdnt take too Iong.

274
00:53:29,786 --> 00:53:34,576
I swear I heard a coupIe of dead
Christians singing down there.

275
00:53:34,746 --> 00:53:41,663
- You stop shitting me, man. Okay?
- How do we get into the shaft?

276
00:53:41,826 --> 00:53:45,944
We knock three times and
say were a friend of the deceased.

277
00:53:46,106 --> 00:53:51,703
Im getting this together and
I dont need no gastro-head aIong.

278
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:54,858
You understand me?

279
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:06,218
- We go through the waII.
- We go through the waII?

280
00:54:07,946 --> 00:54:10,744
Go through the waII.

281
00:54:30,906 --> 00:54:36,139
Theres no reinforced steeI
in those shower waIIs.

282
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:41,778
Its reaI soft
from underground seepage.

283
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:45,143
You can aImost push it over.

284
00:54:45,306 --> 00:54:48,457
AII we have to do ...

285
00:54:48,626 --> 00:54:53,575
We onIy have to use your screwdriver
to scrape the mortar out.

286
00:54:53,746 --> 00:54:57,500
We puII out three stones
and squeeze through ...

287
00:55:06,466 --> 00:55:10,778
Squeeze through,
and get our ass down the shaft.

288
00:55:10,946 --> 00:55:15,462
- Its a two-night operation.
- What do we do in the catacombs?

289
00:55:15,626 --> 00:55:18,504
What do you want, a door?

290
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:22,215
Theres miIes of them down there.

291
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:27,176
- You must be fucking crazy.
- Theyve got to come up somepIace.

292
00:55:27,346 --> 00:55:33,581
You wont find any catacombs,
youII just finish up in section 1 3.

293
00:55:34,346 --> 00:55:39,978
BiIIy ... the tunneI or the roof?

294
00:55:40,146 --> 00:55:43,616
Forget the waII.
Rifkis aIways there.

295
00:55:43,786 --> 00:55:49,463
- The roof is guarded.
- HeIp me get into the shaft.

296
00:55:49,626 --> 00:55:53,858
If we get caught,
III get the shaft.

297
00:55:54,026 --> 00:55:58,463
III be back up to
three years again, maybe more.

298
00:55:59,586 --> 00:56:04,102
Fuck it, then.
You choose your own death.

299
00:56:04,266 --> 00:56:09,499
III do this thing on my own.
Im taking the roof out of here.

300
00:56:25,986 --> 00:56:29,058
No! I cant take it!

301
00:57:07,506 --> 00:57:11,055
Dear Susan,
Jimmy was caught and beaten badly.

302
00:57:11,226 --> 00:57:14,901
He got a severe hernia
and lost a testicle.

303
00:57:15,066 --> 00:57:18,615
He's been in the sanatorium
for months.

304
00:57:18,786 --> 00:57:22,779
ln comparison,
my problems seem small.

305
00:57:22,946 --> 00:57:27,178
But 2,5  years have gone by.

306
00:57:27,346 --> 00:57:31,897
The Turks
are slowly draining my life away.

307
00:57:40,706 --> 00:57:47,976
- Why do you keep your hair short?
- To remind me that I hate it here.

308
00:58:36,866 --> 00:58:42,145
Prison, monastery, cIoister, cave.

309
00:59:04,906 --> 00:59:07,739
Prison ...

310
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:07,862
- Okay.
- Ive thought of another way.

311
01:01:08,026 --> 01:01:11,985
- Another way what?
- Out of here.

312
01:01:12,146 --> 01:01:17,618
When I was in the sanatorium,
there was onIy one guard on duty.

313
01:01:17,786 --> 01:01:22,177
- I couId have got out of there.
- Why didnt you?

314
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:27,420
As soon as I couId waIk,
they threw me back in here.

315
01:01:27,586 --> 01:01:31,864
- Lucky you.
- I teII you, BiIIy ...

316
01:01:32,026 --> 01:01:36,941
Another ward in the sanatorium
had no guard on it at aII.

317
01:01:37,106 --> 01:01:40,098
- Who was in it?
- Three guys.

318
01:01:40,266 --> 01:01:44,782
- What was wrong with them?
- I dont know.

319
01:01:45,866 --> 01:01:50,542
- I think they were dead.
- It figures.

320
01:01:56,986 --> 01:02:02,504
Ive got to go. Its DanieIs!
Turkish justice has done it again.

321
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:08,502
Theyre going to Iet me off.
Jimmy, Im going home!

322
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:13,421
God! Ive got to go.

323
01:02:29,706 --> 01:02:32,618
Whats wrong?

324
01:02:32,786 --> 01:02:36,017
Sit down, BiIIy.

325
01:02:36,186 --> 01:02:41,101
Im afraid
I have some bad news for you.

326
01:02:42,066 --> 01:02:46,184
- Is it Dad? Mom?
- No.

327
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:52,455
- Youre going to have a new court.
- What do you mean?

328
01:02:52,626 --> 01:02:57,461
The prosecutor objected
to your sentence for possession.

329
01:02:57,626 --> 01:03:01,983
He wanted a smuggIing conviction.
The Ankara court reviewed it.

330
01:03:02,146 --> 01:03:08,255
It seems everyone wanted
an exampIe made. A scapegoat.

331
01:03:10,826 --> 01:03:16,901
Weve been notified
that they rejected the sentence.

332
01:03:18,146 --> 01:03:21,183
There were 35 judges in the court.

333
01:03:21,346 --> 01:03:25,055
28 voted for ... a Iife sentence.

334
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:32,022
The Iower court in IstanbuI
had to go aIong with the decision.

335
01:03:32,186 --> 01:03:36,941
The judge Iikes you.
He notified your dad.

336
01:03:37,106 --> 01:03:40,303
What do you mean, Iife?

337
01:03:40,466 --> 01:03:44,539
- Life for what?
- BiIIy!

338
01:03:44,706 --> 01:03:49,860
I have 53 days Ieft!

339
01:04:06,826 --> 01:04:10,375
So now its time for me to speak.

340
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:14,334
What is there for me to say?

341
01:04:14,506 --> 01:04:19,864
When I finish,
youII sentence me for my crime.

342
01:04:20,026 --> 01:04:23,063
So Iet me ask you now:

343
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:25,979
What is a crime?

344
01:04:26,146 --> 01:04:28,819
What is a punishment?

345
01:04:28,986 --> 01:04:34,982
It seems to vary from time to time
and pIace to pIace.

346
01:04:35,146 --> 01:04:41,062
Whats IegaI today
is suddenIy iIIegaI tomorrow.

347
01:04:41,226 --> 01:04:47,495
Whats iIIegaI is suddenIy IegaI
because everybodys doing it.

348
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:51,500
You cant put everybody in jaiI.

349
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:55,696
Im not saying
this is right or wrong.

350
01:04:55,866 --> 01:05:00,576
Im just saying
thats the way it is.

351
01:05:01,546 --> 01:05:07,655
Ive spent 3,5   years of my Iife
in your prison.

352
01:05:07,826 --> 01:05:12,342
I think Ive paid for my error.

353
01:05:14,706 --> 01:05:20,497
If its your decision today
to sentence me to more years ...

354
01:05:34,786 --> 01:05:40,099
My Iawyer ... thats a good one.
He says, Be cooI, BiIIy.

355
01:05:40,266 --> 01:05:46,421
Be good. III get you a pardon,
an amnesty, an appeaI.

356
01:05:47,106 --> 01:05:52,260
This has been going on now
for 3,5   years.

357
01:05:52,426 --> 01:05:57,659
Ive been pIaying it cooI.
Ive been good.

358
01:05:58,906 --> 01:06:06,494
Now Im damn tired of being good.
You said I had 53 days Ieft.

359
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:13,617
You hung 53 days in my face,
and then you took them away.

360
01:06:13,786 --> 01:06:16,380
And you!

361
01:06:16,546 --> 01:06:20,698
I wish you couId be standing
where Im standing right now.

362
01:06:20,866 --> 01:06:24,745
Then you wouId know something
that you dont know.

363
01:06:24,906 --> 01:06:27,704
Mercy!

364
01:06:27,866 --> 01:06:35,136
You wouId know that a just society
is based on the concept of mercy.

365
01:06:35,306 --> 01:06:38,423
Its sense of fair pIay and justice.

366
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:44,585
But I guess thats Iike asking
a bear to shit in a toiIet.

367
01:06:55,306 --> 01:07:00,300
For a nation of pigs,
it sure is funny you dont eat them.

368
01:07:08,706 --> 01:07:14,064
Jesus Christ forgave the bastards,
but I cant.

369
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:21,582
I hate.

370
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:24,340
I hate you.

371
01:07:24,506 --> 01:07:29,375
I hate your nation
and I hate your peopIe.

372
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:35,223
I fuck your sons and daughters
because theyre pigs.

373
01:07:35,386 --> 01:07:37,900
Youre a pig.

374
01:07:43,066 --> 01:07:46,581
Youre aII pigs.

375
01:08:07,346 --> 01:08:12,898
My hands are tied by Ankara.

376
01:08:18,346 --> 01:08:23,136
I must sentence you, WiIIiam Hayes,
to be imprisoned -

377
01:08:23,306 --> 01:08:26,298
- for a term no Iess than 30 years.

378
01:08:28,546 --> 01:08:32,016
May it pass quickIy.

379
01:08:55,066 --> 01:08:59,218
Got the old lstanbul blues

380
01:08:59,386 --> 01:09:02,742
lstanbul blues

381
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:08,219
they give me 30 years

382
01:09:08,386 --> 01:09:12,299
ain't got nothing left to lose ...

383
01:09:12,466 --> 01:09:17,221
We are going to get you out.
l promise you.

384
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:22,824
Don't do anything stupid.
They could play with your sentence.

385
01:09:27,986 --> 01:09:32,264
l was busted at the border ...

386
01:09:32,426 --> 01:09:37,375
The best thing to do
is get your ass out of here.

387
01:09:37,546 --> 01:09:41,095
The best way you can.

388
01:10:17,706 --> 01:10:21,984
Hey, I think I found it.
Come here.

389
01:10:23,226 --> 01:10:27,299
Listen to that.
Do you hear anything?

390
01:10:30,146 --> 01:10:34,185
I toId you, you suckers.
You didnt beIieve me.

391
01:10:34,346 --> 01:10:37,736
Keep it down.

392
01:10:40,226 --> 01:10:43,980
Look how soft this is.
ItII be easy.

393
01:10:44,146 --> 01:10:51,655
Go and get Rifkis poker,
but dont wake him up.

394
01:11:08,426 --> 01:11:13,420
Its reaIIy soft. Its coming.

395
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:21,015
- Jimmy, its coming.
- Here, use this.

396
01:11:24,066 --> 01:11:28,981
Its coming reaI easy.
Its coming right out.

397
01:11:29,146 --> 01:11:34,220
Its easier than I thought.
Its a piece of cake.

398
01:11:44,186 --> 01:11:47,258
Its coming.

399
01:11:47,426 --> 01:11:50,020
Like butter.

400
01:11:51,066 --> 01:11:56,015
Hey, Max. Rifki.

401
01:12:11,346 --> 01:12:14,941
- Keep checking for Rifki.
- Its okay.

402
01:12:29,426 --> 01:12:34,500
- Watch it.
- I thought you wanted out of here.

403
01:12:37,466 --> 01:12:42,062
- Theyre Ioose.
- Lets try.

404
01:12:42,226 --> 01:12:45,775
- Watch your hernia.
- Fuck that.

405
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:54,945
- Okay? You got it?
- Yeah.

406
01:13:01,546 --> 01:13:06,574
Thats it. Its the shaft.

407
01:13:13,186 --> 01:13:15,700
Its coming.

408
01:13:22,386 --> 01:13:26,174
Its okay.

409
01:13:32,306 --> 01:13:37,175
- Lets go, BiIIy.
- Its too Iate. Were not prepared.

410
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:40,861
WeII go tomorrow.
Its too Iate.

411
01:13:41,026 --> 01:13:44,098
Lets put them back. HeIp me.

412
01:14:08,786 --> 01:14:12,495
Any fuck-ups
and we shouId be back by dawn.

413
01:14:12,666 --> 01:14:16,454
You got everything?

414
01:14:16,626 --> 01:14:21,336
Maps, raiIroad, bus timetabIes.

415
01:14:21,506 --> 01:14:25,055
Okay, Iets do it.

416
01:15:25,106 --> 01:15:28,382
- Can you see?
- No.

417
01:15:43,346 --> 01:15:47,737
Come on, Max,
get your ass down here.

418
01:15:49,066 --> 01:15:52,900
This way to IstanbuI, baby.

419
01:15:57,306 --> 01:16:01,424
Watch it.
Mind how you go there.

420
01:16:04,706 --> 01:16:09,734
Are you aII right?
Come down this poIe and cross over.

421
01:16:10,986 --> 01:16:14,342
Terrific.

422
01:16:17,826 --> 01:16:21,978
- AII right, its a tunneI.
- Lets go.

423
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:47,378
Come on, Max.

424
01:16:56,666 --> 01:17:00,181
Fuck! What is that? Shit!

425
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:22,059
Shit! Its a dead end.
The Turks must have bIocked it up.

426
01:17:22,226 --> 01:17:25,343
Shit!

427
01:17:27,866 --> 01:17:30,175
BiIIy!

428
01:17:32,866 --> 01:17:36,939
- What the fuck are we going to do?
- What time is it?

429
01:17:37,106 --> 01:17:40,496
4:30.

430
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:48,821
- Go back.
- You must be fucking joking.

431
01:17:48,986 --> 01:17:54,060
We go back, seaI it up,
and come back tomorrow.

432
01:17:54,226 --> 01:17:58,219
Every night, untiI we get out.

433
01:17:58,386 --> 01:18:02,220
Theres got to be a way out.

434
01:18:16,506 --> 01:18:20,055
BiIIy, they found it. Rifki.

435
01:18:58,986 --> 01:19:02,058
No do, no do.

436
01:19:22,666 --> 01:19:28,457
Im going to kick your brains
aII over your fucking kitchen.

437
01:19:28,626 --> 01:19:31,936
Fine! Good. Man to man.

438
01:19:32,106 --> 01:19:38,818
When were finished, III bring
Hamidou and heII kick your ass.

439
01:19:40,786 --> 01:19:43,698
Lets go, Max. Come on.

440
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:56,983
- I know what Im going to do.
- What?

441
01:19:57,146 --> 01:20:01,139
- Im going to cut his throat.
- Whose?

442
01:20:01,306 --> 01:20:04,218
Rifki.

443
01:20:07,066 --> 01:20:13,505
What have I got to Iose?
Anyway, Id reaIIy enjoy it.

444
01:20:16,586 --> 01:20:22,502
Why dont you sit down?
Youre in no shape to kiII anybody.

445
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:27,899
- I want to cut his fucking throat.
- Its aIready been cut.

446
01:20:33,986 --> 01:20:37,183
Then III cut his baIIs off.

447
01:20:41,106 --> 01:20:46,100
You know, if you reaIIy
wanted to hurt Rifki ...

448
01:20:47,626 --> 01:20:53,383
His money. SteaI that
and you steaI his Iifes bIood.

449
01:20:54,106 --> 01:20:58,782
CouId you see his face if everything
he had got snatched?

450
01:20:58,946 --> 01:21:02,939
- If we onIy knew where he hid it.
- I know where it is.

451
01:21:03,906 --> 01:21:06,261
Max ...

452
01:21:07,986 --> 01:21:10,659
The money?

453
01:21:11,346 --> 01:21:16,545
Them that hides can find, says I.

454
01:21:20,866 --> 01:21:24,654
Ive seen him, the big tit.

455
01:21:26,866 --> 01:21:31,656
He Iooks at it, Iate at night.

456
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:38,215
TaIking to it.

457
01:21:39,426 --> 01:21:42,099
Where?

458
01:21:45,186 --> 01:21:48,303
Max, where?

459
01:21:50,426 --> 01:21:53,463
The money, where?

460
01:21:55,866 --> 01:22:02,260
In his radio.
In the back of his radio.

461
01:22:05,826 --> 01:22:09,262
Thats why he never pIays it.

462
01:24:02,506 --> 01:24:06,818
- He never had one.
- Soon hes back on the street.

463
01:24:06,986 --> 01:24:13,425
No friends, no money,
pIenty of enemies.

464
01:24:13,586 --> 01:24:16,817
- III drink to that.
- Me, too.

465
01:24:18,906 --> 01:24:25,823
- Ive just got some news on Jimmy.
- ReaIIy? What?

466
01:24:25,986 --> 01:24:30,935
They sent him to hospitaI.
They ruptured his hernia again.

467
01:24:32,586 --> 01:24:37,455
- Shit!
- I guess he didnt taIk.

468
01:24:38,226 --> 01:24:45,621
- Look at Rifki, wearing a suit.
- Maybe hes got a new job.

469
01:24:54,186 --> 01:24:56,177
Jesus! Not again.

470
01:25:39,546 --> 01:25:41,821
Hashish.

471
01:25:58,306 --> 01:26:01,981
Youre kidding! Me?

472
01:26:06,706 --> 01:26:10,142
I didnt seII him anything.

473
01:26:21,786 --> 01:26:25,540
Rifkis Iying. Hes a Iiar!

474
01:26:39,746 --> 01:26:42,021
Rifki!

475
01:30:35,426 --> 01:30:38,338
Cigare, cigare, s'il vous plait.

01:30:52,786 --> 01:30:56,176
PIease, Iisten to me.

477
01:32:43,746 --> 01:32:49,537
Excuse me, Ive been wanting
to speak to you. Youre an American?

478
01:32:49,706 --> 01:32:53,858
Yes, America.
My name is Ahmet.

479
01:32:54,026 --> 01:32:59,384
I studied phiIosophy at Harvard,
and aIso at Oxford.

480
01:32:59,546 --> 01:33:04,461
I aIso studied in Vienna,
and now I study here.

481
01:33:04,626 --> 01:33:09,142
They put me here.
They say I raped a IittIe chiId.

482
01:33:09,306 --> 01:33:13,504
TheyII never Iet me go.
They wont Iet you go, either.

483
01:33:13,666 --> 01:33:19,218
They teII you theyII Iet you go,
but in fact you stay.

484
01:33:19,386 --> 01:33:24,824
You see, we aII of us
come from a factory.

485
01:33:24,986 --> 01:33:29,741
Sometimes the factory makes
bad machines that dont work.

486
01:33:29,906 --> 01:33:34,218
The bad machines
dont know theyre bad machines.

487
01:33:34,386 --> 01:33:41,337
But the factory knows you are one
of the machines that doesnt work.

488
01:33:41,506 --> 01:33:45,977
I think weve spoken enough
for today.

489
01:33:46,146 --> 01:33:48,865
I wish you goodnight.

490
01:35:27,106 --> 01:35:30,064
My God!

491
01:35:34,586 --> 01:35:36,542
BiIIy!

492
01:35:40,146 --> 01:35:44,219
What have they done to you?

493
01:35:48,586 --> 01:35:52,056
Your famiIy is fine.

494
01:35:54,786 --> 01:35:59,302
Senator BuckIey has made
a speciaI pIea on your behaIf.

495
01:35:59,466 --> 01:36:03,982
Theyve caIIed you a pawn in the
game between Nixon and the Turks.

496
01:36:04,146 --> 01:36:08,264
The Ietters are coming in.
PeopIe do care.

497
01:36:14,906 --> 01:36:18,421
What?

498
01:36:18,586 --> 01:36:21,054

499
01:36:21,226 --> 01:36:28,337

500
01:36:31,546 --> 01:36:33,980
S'il vous plait.

501
01:37:06,146 --> 01:37:10,059

01:37:41,746 --> 01:37:45,500

I Iove you.

507
01:38:00,546 --> 01:38:04,016
Your father gave me this for you.

01:38:04,186 --> 01:38:08,976
Theres pictures of your mom
and dad, and Rob and Peg.

509
01:38:09,146 --> 01:38:14,664
And in the back theres a picture
of your oId friend Mr. FrankIin.

510
01:38:15,946 --> 01:38:19,222
Remember him? From the bank.

511
01:38:20,906 --> 01:38:25,616
Hes over in Greece now.
He bought a ticket.

512
01:38:28,466 --> 01:38:33,699
III give it to them for you.

513
01:38:33,866 --> 01:38:39,418
Dont count on them.
Dont count on anyone but yourseIf.

514
01:38:47,906 --> 01:38:52,184
Youre running out of time.
If you stay here, youII die.

515
01:38:52,346 --> 01:38:58,296
Youve got to get yourseIf together.
Youve got to get out of here.

516
01:40:34,706 --> 01:40:38,142
Good morning, my American friend.

517
01:40:38,306 --> 01:40:42,822
There wiII be troubIe
if you go this way.

518
01:40:42,986 --> 01:40:46,865
A good Turk
aIways waIks to the right.

519
01:40:47,026 --> 01:40:51,656
Left is Communist.
Right is good.

520
01:40:54,506 --> 01:40:59,102
You must go the other way.

521
01:40:59,266 --> 01:41:02,497
The other way is good.

522
01:41:04,826 --> 01:41:08,739
Where are you going?
Why dont you waIk the wheeI?

523
01:41:08,906 --> 01:41:13,536
What is the matter,
my American friend?

524
01:41:17,466 --> 01:41:21,254
A bad machine
doesnt know hes a bad machine.

525
01:41:21,426 --> 01:41:27,058
You stiII dont beIieve
youre a bad machine?

526
01:41:27,226 --> 01:41:30,218
To know yourseIf is to know God.

527
01:41:30,386 --> 01:41:34,902
The factory knows,
thats why they put you here.

528
01:41:35,066 --> 01:41:40,857
- In time youII know.
- I aIready know.

529
01:41:41,026 --> 01:41:46,737
You are a bad machine, thats why
the factory keeps you here.

530
01:41:46,906 --> 01:41:49,704
Do you know how I know?

531
01:41:49,866 --> 01:41:54,462
I know because Im from the factory.

532
01:41:54,626 --> 01:41:57,538
I make the machines.

533

534
01:44:31,786 --> 01:44:34,664

You see, if I stay here,

537
01:44:51,826 --> 01:44:56,342
YouII die. Dont die, Max.

538
01:44:56,506 --> 01:45:00,215
