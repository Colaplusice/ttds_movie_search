1
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,520
- I'm Statler.
- I'm Waldorf.

2
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,656
We're here to heckle
<i>The Muppet Movie.</i>

3
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,497
That's straight ahead,
private screening room "D."

4
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,733
- Private screening?
- They're afraid to show it in public!

5
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,710
Look at this place.
What a dump!

6
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,439
Bunch of weirdos around here.
Look at 'em.

7
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:25,212
- Yes, I know you all want to...
- Lady, is this seat taken?

8
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:28,652
What... Hey, you!
Bring that back!

9
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:33,249
I'm so nervous. If I'm not funny,
I won't be able to live with myself.

10
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,318
Well, then you'll have to get
another apartment, won't you?

11
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:39,832
I hear this movie is dynamite.

12
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,528
Get your fresh organic popcorn,
only a buck.

13
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,538
- Buy me some, please.
- Sure, Mama.

14
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:52,476
- Nothin's too good for my woman.
- Woman! Woman! Woman!

15
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,776
- I like the movie fine so far.
- It hasn't started yet.

16
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,113
That's what I like about it!

17
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,143
Do it!

18
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,290
Oh, hey, Mr. Defrog!

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,558
Is it okay for me and my boomerang fish
to be in your movie?

20
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,859
Hey!

21
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,730
I told you, Luke, not in the movie
or at the screening.

22
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,134
Hey, but watch.

23
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:22,072
Kermit, does this film have
socially redeeming value?

24
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,372
I certainly hope so, Sam.

25
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,275
Sorry about that.

26
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,213
- Kermie!
- Hi, Piggy.

27
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:32,115
I tried to save you a seat,
but somebody took it.

28
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:36,053
Hi, everybody, and welcome to
the first screening of <i>The Muppet Movie.</i>

29
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:42,654
But before we begin, I'd like to thank
everyone who contributed to this film...

30
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,254
starting with the little people,
from the hairdressers...

31
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,162
to special effects...

32
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:52,361
- That's enough of that, Harry!
- Blow it up! Blow it up!

33
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,937
To the costume designers,
to the prop makers...

34
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,106
Speeches are not necessary, dear.
Roll the film.

35
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,910
But I'd like
to thank everybody...

36
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:06,213
for all of their hard work
and patience...

37
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,754
Roll film! Roll film!

38
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,721
Roll film!

39
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,099
Excuse me.

40
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:31,633
Uncle Kermit, is this about how
the Muppets really got started?

41
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,408
Well, it's sort of
approximately how it happened.

42
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:50,086
<i>Why are there so many</i>

43
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:53,125
<i>Songs about rainbows</i>

44
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:57,754
<i>And what's on the other side</i>

45
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,466
<i>Rainbows are visions</i>

46
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,561
<i>But only illusions</i>

47
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:10,337
<i>And rainbows have nothing to hide</i>

48
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,171
<i>So we've been told</i>

49
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:18,274
<i>And some choose to believe it</i>

50
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:22,845
<i>I know they're wrong</i>
<i>Wait and see</i>

51
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,626
<i>Someday we'll find it</i>

52
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,686
<i>The rainbow connection</i>

53
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:35,359
<i>The lovers, the dreamers and me</i>

54
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,170
<i>Who said that every wish</i>

55
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:46,211
<i>Would be heard and answered</i>

56
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,978
<i>When wished on the morning star</i>

57
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,711
<i>Somebody thought of that</i>

58
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:59,053
<i>And someone believed it</i>

59
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:03,494
<i>Look what it's done so far</i>

60
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,825
<i>What's so amazing</i>

61
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,336
<i>That keeps us stargazing</i>

62
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:15,932
<i>And what do we think</i>
<i>we might see</i>

63
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,612
<i>Someday we'll find it</i>

64
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,808
<i>The rainbow connection</i>

65
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:28,718
<i>The lovers, the dreamers and me</i>

66
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:32,918
<i>All of us under its spell</i>

67
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:36,553
<i>We know that it's probably</i>

68
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:41,328
<i>Magic</i>

69
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,268
<i>Have you been half asleep</i>

70
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,771
<i>And have you heard voices</i>

71
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:52,010
<i>I've heard them calling my name</i>

72
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,606
<i>Is this the sweet sound</i>

73
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,810
<i>That calls the young sailors</i>

74
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:04,550
<i>The voice might be one and the same</i>

75
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,726
<i>I've heard it too many times</i>

76
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,196
<i>To ignore it</i>

77
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,964
<i>It's something</i>
<i>that I'm supposed to be</i>

78
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,573
<i>Someday we'll find it</i>

79
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,542
<i>The rainbow connection</i>

80
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,638
<i>The lovers, the dreamers and me</i>

81
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,794
Help! Hello!
This is a serious call for help.

82
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,729
- Yeah?
- Someone help!

83
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:00,504
You with the banjo,
can you help me?

84
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,707
I have lost
my sense of direction.

85
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,409
Have you tried Hare Krishna?

86
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,186
No, I mean, I'm really lost!

87
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:12,122
One second.
Darn, I missed.

88
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,751
That's the first thing
to go on a frog, his tongue.

89
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,091
The tongue goes and you
can't catch flies.

90
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,860
I'm sorry about your tongue,
but I have to get out of this swamp.

91
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,391
- I have to catch a plane.
- With that tongue? No way.

92
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,465
- There's a boat dock just downstream.
- Thank you.

93
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:33,137
- Just watch out for the alligators.
- I will.

94
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,043
- Alligators?
- That's right.

95
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:39,608
- Did you say alligators?
- Read my lips... alligators.

96
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,313
I'm not used to alligators
where I come from.

97
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:46,586
See, I'm an agent.
I winged in from Hollywood.

98
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,422
- Hollywood?
- That's right.

99
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:52,590
- Did you say Hollywood?
- Read my lips... Hollywood.

100
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:56,226
You know... <i>Hollywood</i>
The dream factory. The magic store.

101
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,862
Hey, don't you ever
go to the movies?

102
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,805
Sure, there's a double feature
in town every Saturday.

103
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,009
- Wait a minute.
- What?

104
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,912
There's an ad in here that you
should be very interested in.

105
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,213
Feast your eyes on that.

106
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:18,121
"World Wide Studios announces
open auditions for frogs...

107
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,919
wishing to become rich and famous."

108
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:24,258
Thanks anyway, but I'm really
pretty happy where I am.

109
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,562
If I were you, I would give this
audition very careful consideration.

110
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,262
You've got talent, kid...
singin', tellin'jokes.

111
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,805
I mean, if you get your tongue fixed,
who knows?

112
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,807
You could make
millions of people happy.

113
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,710
Millions of people happy.

114
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,303
Millions!
If you ever come west...

115
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,577
to Hollywood, look me up...
Bernie, the agent.

116
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,017
Listen, Bernie the agent, why don't
you say hello to Arnie the alligator?

117
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,722
- What!
- Arnie!

118
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:57,189
- Arnie, wait a minute. Careful.
- Stay! Stay!

119
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:01,529
Arnie, leave him alone.
He's from Hollywood.

120
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,372
Hollywood. Gee.

121
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,708
Well, I'd miss
this old swamp, but...

122
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,679
millions of people happy.

123
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,846
What the...

124
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,973
Okay, you guys,
do what I tell you.

125
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,915
I don't know where your...

126
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,954
Don't step on that asphalt!

127
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,252
We gotta get this...
Off the asphalt!

128
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,725
I told you, stay off the asphalt!
Hey, look at him.

129
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,563
- What are those big legs?
- Hey, you on the bike!

130
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,330
Watch out! Watch out!

131
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,304
Oh, my gosh!

132
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,573
That's pretty dangerous, building a road
in the middle of the street.

133
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:26,277
I mean, if frogs couldn't hop,
I'd be gone with the Schwinn.

134
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,289
"The El Sleezo Cafe."

135
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,194
Foreign food.

136
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,530
Doesn't smell promising,
but...

137
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,762
a frog's gotta eat.

138
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,441
Wow.

139
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,917
Rough place, huh?

140
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,979
That the toughest, meanest, filthiest
pest hole on the face of the Earth!

141
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,891
- Why not complain to the owner?
- I am the owner.

142
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,744
Watch out. Hot plates
comin' through. Look out.

143
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,310
You got your french-fried
frog legs au gratin...

144
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,186
you got your frog legs almandine,
you got your frog legs stroganoff.

145
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,351
Everybody happy?
All right.

146
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,899
Hello, sailor.
Buy me a drink?

147
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,873
I'm not a sailor,
I'm a frog.

148
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,775
- Cut the small talk and buy me a drink.
- I don't even know you.

149
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,144
Hey, you makin'
a move on my girl?

150
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:06,150
- No, sir.
- He did too. He touched me.

151
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,277
Go wash!
You'll get warts.

152
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,551
- No, that's just a myth.
- Yeah, but she's my "mith"!

153
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,216
No, no, myth, myth!

154
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,784
- Yes?
- What the hey?

155
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:23,363
Show time!
Show time at the El Sleezo.

156
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:30,168
And now, filling in for the vacationing
El Sleezo dancing girls...

157
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,473
the funny, furry, fabulous...

158
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,538
Fozzie Bear!

159
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:46,253
You're a great crowd!
Thank you, thank you and thank you!

160
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,762
Here I am, Fozzie Bear,
to tell you jokes both old and rare!

161
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,295
Get off the stage!

162
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:03,102
Let's start things off
with a bang!

163
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,939
Thank you, sir.

164
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,741
This guy's lost.

165
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,907
Maybe he should try
Hare Krishna.

166
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,452
Good grief.
It's a running gag.

167
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,152
There was this sailor
who was so fat...

168
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,819
How fat was he?

169
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:25,830
He was so fat
that everybody liked him...

170
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,366
and there was nothing
funny about him at all.

171
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,496
No problem!

172
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,562
Please!
Oh, please!

173
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,541
I'm trying so hard.
Please don't get mad.

174
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,137
I'm a professional.
I've had three performances.

175
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,204
- Curtain! Curtain!
- Do you know any dance routines?

176
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,842
What? Not really. Do you?

177
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,410
- Play something snappy.
- You got it.

178
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,452
- Now dance!
- What?

179
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,959
Dance!

180
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,333
It's too bad the dancing girls
are on vacation.

181
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,036
The crowd is getting ugly.

182
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,239
You think this crowd's ugly,
you should see the dancing girls!

183
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,677
Two, three, four.

184
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,356
- Two, three, kick!
- Kick. Yeah, sorry.

185
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,790
Comin' home!

186
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,609
I just cleaned the fur, please!

187
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:12,395
I hope you appreciate that
I'm doing all my own stunts.

188
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,772
Okay, everybody,
drinks on the house!

189
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,647
- Drinks on the house!
- Yeah! Go, go! On the house!

190
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,751
I don't see no drinks up here.
What's he talkin' about?

191
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,092
The bartender said there
were drinks on the house.

192
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:45,426
- Works every time.
- Huh. Wow.

193
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,031
My name is Kermit the Frog,
and I'm on my way to Hollywood.

194
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,803
- Hollywood?
- You want to join me?

195
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:54,471
Big-time show biz!
That's always been my dream.

196
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,447
They're holding auditions
for frogs next week.

197
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,145
And if they need frogs,
they must need bears too.

198
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,211
My car's right outside!

199
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:08,359
Gee, a Studebaker.
Where'd you get it?

200
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,021
- My uncle left it to me.
- Is he dead?

201
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,030
No, he's hibernating.

202
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,446
You know, Fozzie, you really
do have a lot of talent.

203
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:35,817
- Thank you.
- How about we put together an act?

204
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,153
Nope. Sorry.
I only work as a single.

205
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,158
Okay.

206
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,364
All right, you talked me into it!
We'll be a team!

207
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,062
- Oh, good.
- What's this?

208
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,536
- You better pull over here.
- Yes, sir.

209
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,678
Hey, what's goin' on?

210
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,615
Howdy, Mr. Frog.

211
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,550
- I'm a businessman with a proposition.
- What?

212
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,986
Let me show you somethin' that
might change your whole life.

213
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,523
Hop right over here,
my little green friend.

214
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,088
- Listen, mister...
- That's it.

215
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,260
This is the kind of chance
you can't afford to pass up.

216
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:29,073
Now, now, don't be afraid.
Watch the window.

217
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,175
What's that?

218
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,706
<i>Hi, I'm Doc Hopper...</i>

219
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,945
<i>invitin'you to hop on down and get</i>

<i>Frog legs so fine</i>

<i>Hopper's is the place</i>
<i>you should dine</i>

225

<i>There's cheese legs</i>
<i>bacon legs, chili legs too</i>

226

- Oh, Fozzie.

- <i>If you want just a snack</i>
- Don't worry.

228

<i>Then here is the one</i>

229
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,875
<i>A frog-leg burger</i>
<i>on a bright green bun</i>

230
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:17,513
That is terrible! That's the most
revolting thing I've ever seen!

231
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,955
I know. I'm a great businessman
and a sweet fella...

232
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,993
but I do lack the skills
of a performer.

233
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,028
You also make a lousy frog!

234
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,929
You, on the other hand,
make a terrific frog!

235
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,025
- What?
- He's right. You are very likable.

236
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,037
The bear's right.
You, my little likable friend...

237
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,437
are gonna do all our
television commercials!

238
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,032
- No way!
- Just a minute.

239
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,341
There's $500 in it for you,
up front.

240
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:45,110
$500 is just the beginnin'.

241
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,278
You could be earnin'
this much every year.

242
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,346
- Let's go, Fozzie.
- $500?

243
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,790
Would you consider
a bear in a frog suit?

244
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,829
- Fozzie!
- I just lost my head.

245
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:01,354
Just a minute, Mr. Frog.
Everything's negotiable.

246
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,893
- Okay, here we go. Sorry!
- Hey, that's my Caddy!

247
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,270
- Just get it in gear, Fozzie!
- Yes, sir. Here we go!

248
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,504
This is money we're talkin' about.
Max!

249
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,380
Follow that frog!

250
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,982
Max!

251
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,287
Follow that frog
with me in the car!

252
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:30,658
I'm sorry, Doc, I just got excited.
Isn't the frog terrific?

253
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,527
- Terrific. Now go!
- But you promised me a reward.

254
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,591
Later, Max.
Now follow that frog!

255
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,576
- It's a gorgeous day.
- Yep, certainly is.

256
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:48,443
- Yep, terrific day for a drive.
- Beautiful country out here.

308
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,100
Kermit, that's you!

309
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,176
You got the picture, boy?
You see what I mean?

310
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:10,510
Kermit the Frog, symbol of
Doc Hopper's French-Fried Frog Legs.

311
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:14,916
Isn't that splendid?
Just take a look at it.

312
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:18,387
All I can see are millions
of frogs on tiny crutches.

313
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:23,420
Now listen, boy, don't you
want to be rich and famous?

314
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,429
- Not workin' for you, I don't!
- That's right.

315
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,898
- Crutches?
- Shut up, Max!

316
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,901
We're a small-time operation...

317
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,769
but we're expandin',
just like you frogs expand!

318
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,401
- Don't you frogs expand?
- That's a myth!

319
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,968
- What?
- Myth, myth!

320
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,775
Yes?

321
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:47,811
- Burn rubber.
- Yes, sir.

322
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,718
Hey, frog!

323
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,593
That's the second time!

324
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,185
Max, I've done
my best with that frog.

325
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,458
Now's the time to do my worst.
Open the door.

326
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,432
- No, you open the door!
- What?

327
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,969
I'm through, Doc.
The frog is right.

328
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:07,698
You're asking him to do something
terrible. I can't be a part of it.

329
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,899
It's a moral decision,
and I'll stand by it!

330
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,603
- I'll double your percentage.
- I'll open the door.

331
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,710
- Kermit, where are we?
- Well, let's see.

332
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,948
We were just travelling down
this little black line here...

333
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:27,014
and we just crossed that
little red line over there.

334
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:29,458
Let's take the blue line, huh?

335
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:33,362
- We can't take that. That's a river.
- I knew that.

336
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:37,367
- Yeah, sure.
- Listen, why don't we just go...

337
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,868
- Fozzie?
- Yeah?

338
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,370
Who's driving?

339
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,973
- Look out! Stop!
- No problem!

340
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,048
- Okay, back it up.
- Yes, sir.

341
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,674
Fozzie, where did you
learn to drive?

342
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,311
I took a correspondence course.

343
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,883
- This looks like a nice, quiet spot.
- Uh-huh.

344
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,821
It feels like we've been
driving for days.

345
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,595
- Funny, I'm still wide awake.
- Me too.

346
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,597
Me too.

347
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,679
I'm up! I'm up!

348
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,012
What's that?

349
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:37,059
They don't look like
Presbyterians to me.

350
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,367
Hey, cool it, everybody!

351
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:59,716
Our gentle mornin' melodies have
attracted wanderin' admirers.

352
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:03,345
- Hey, who are you guys?
- We am, is, are and be...

353
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:07,152
they whom as are known as
the Electric Mayhem.

354
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,920
For sure!

355
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,326
He's Dr. Teeth!

356
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:15,765
Golden teeth and golden tones.
Welcome to my presence.

357
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,893
- Thank you.
- Fozzie...

358
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,994
I'm Floyd.
I blow bass.

359
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,904
And I'm...

360
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,942
Zoot.
Sax is your axe.

361
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,002
Uh-oh, Zoot skipped a groove again.

362
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,981
Wow, like, I'm Janice
on lead guitar, for sure.

363
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,618
That's Animal.
Show 'em what you do, Animal!

364
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,490
I want to eat drums!

365
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,051
No, no, beat drums!
Beat drums!

366
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,265
Beat drums! Beat drums!

367
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:54,734
- Down, Animal! Back! Sit!
- Down, back, sit!

368
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,673
Hey, don't forget about me.

369
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:00,074
I'm Scooter,
the band's road manager.

370
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,603
Yeah, we couldn't go
anywhere without him.

371
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,015
- He's the man with the contacts?
- No, he's the man with the van!

372
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,783
We're takin' this old church
and turnin' it into a coffee house.

373
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:16,088
Yeah, with real good music
and organic refreshments.

374
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:20,598
Boy, it'll be so fine and laid back
and mellow and profitable.

375
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,426
Yeah, but what
brings you dudes here?

376
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:28,063
Listen, see, Kermit here
was living in the swamp.

377
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,073
- Fozzie...
- Then a fisherman came along.

378
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,406
You can't tell 'em the whole story.
You'll bore the audience.

379
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,714
Oh, sorry.
But, Kermit.

380
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:41,149
- The band here wants to know.
- Let 'em read the screenplay.

381
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,915
Yes, sir!

382
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:49,657
See, it starts here on page one.

383
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,719
<i>The Muppet Movie,</i> huh?

384
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:56,665
Let's see.
"Exterior. Swamp. Day.

385
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,603
In a long helicopter shot
we discover Kermit the Frog...

386
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,640
playin' his banjo and singin'.

387
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,699
A Hollywood agent starts
the frog traveling west.

388
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:09,042
Doc Hopper comes on strong
and they get to this church.

389
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,912
Interior. Church. Day. Fozzie.

390
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,952
They don't look like
Presbyterians to me.

391
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,046
Kermit and Fozzie come walkin'
down the aisle...

392
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,592
to the thunderously loud music...

393
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,787
of Dr. Teeth
and the Electric Mayhem."

394
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,297
Which am us!
Yeah! Yeah!

395
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:32,530
This is a narrative of
very heavy-duty proportions.

396
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:37,667
Cosmic, man. We gotta keep this little
froggy away from this Hopper dude.

397
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,801
Too true.
Too true.

398
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:43,974
It is indeed a problem for
us to "probosculate" upon.

399
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:48,747
But it seems the frog and the bear
are temporarily out of service.

400
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,746
Wow, like, what
can we do to help them?

401
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,759
- Well, if this were the movies...
- Which it is.

402
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,920
We'd think of
a clever plot device.

403
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:02,023
Like disguising their car
so they won't be recognized.

404
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,863
Right, two, three, four.

405
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,038

00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,768

I don't know how
to thank you guys.

447
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:38,353
- I don't know why to thank you guys.
- Our pleasure, green stuff.

448
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,516
Are you sure you won't come
with us to Hollywood?

449
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:43,560
Can't, baby.
But when you get rich and famous...

450
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,324
maybe we'll show up
and exploit your wealth.

451
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,498
Movin' right along, Fozzie.

452
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,697
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

Hollywood! Hollywood!

454
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,550
Remember,
this frog does everything.

455
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,109
He talks, he sings,
he dances, he tells jokes.

456
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,486
He even rides a bicycle.

457
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,025
Max, find me a frog and a bear
in a tan Studebaker.

458
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:20,292
Gee, Doc, all I can see is a frog and
a bear in a rainbow-colored Studebaker.

459
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,095
- What?
- What?

460
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,534
- Fozzie, they're right behind us!
- I know! I know!

461
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:29,164
- How did they recognize us?
- They recognized you.

462
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,174
- What do you mean?
- There's a hundred bears around.

463
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,176
I'm gaining on 'em, Doc!

464
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,940
- Can't you drive any faster?
- No, sir.

465
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,504
Pull in front of that sign.

466
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,312
- Now duck.
- What?

467
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,478
- Get down, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.

468
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:57,560
Oh, yeah?

469
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,569
Uh-huh, yeah.

470
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,709
I tell ya, Camilla.
Great plumbers are born, not made.

471
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,508
I'm a prince of the plunger,
fair maiden.

472
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:15,818
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. We'll do that.
Just wait till we get there.

473
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,355
Fozzie, look at that
funny little truck.

474
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:21,153
- Yeah. Cute, huh?
- No, it's coming straight at us.

475
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:25,895
We're gonna hit!

476
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:32,032
- We missed it.
- Oh? You call that a miss?

477
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,632
I'm getting in your car.

478
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:44,237
- You guys okay?
- Why are you hopping up and down?

479
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:47,716
- Because I'm hopping mad.
- Guy's got a sense of humor.

480
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,512
- Hey, why don't you join us?
- Where are you going?

481
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:56,083
- We're following our dream.
- Really? I have a dream too.

482
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,628
- Oh?
- But you'll think it's stupid.

483
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,630
- No, I won't.
- Tell us. Tell us.

484
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:04,259
I wanna go to Bombay, India,
and become a movie star.

485
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,964
You don't go to Bombay
to become a movie star.

486
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,098
You go where we're going...
Hollywood!

487
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:14,304
Sure, if you wanna do it
the easy way.

488
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,142
We picked up a weirdo.

489
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,443
Hey, look up ahead.
There's Mad Man Mooney's.

490
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,851
- What's that?
- That's a used car lot.

491
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:26,856
Maybe we can trade in both
these old cars and get one big one.

492
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,916
- Wait, trade in my uncle's Studebaker?
- Sure.

493
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:33,987
- When he wakes up, he'll kill me.
- You're swingin' this turn very wide.

494
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,226
Hold it, will ya?
Here we go. Up the bump.

495
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,996
Okay, here we go. Hold on.

496
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,005
- Pull it up ahead there.
- Look at these cars!

497
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:45,873
- Are you gonna sell my plunger too?
- No, he's not.

498
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:48,571
Look at 'em up there.
Pull it up a little farther.

499
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,137
Where shall I stop?
How should I stop?

500
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,274
- A little bit farther.
- Okay. Here?

501
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,680
- Everybody out of the car.
- Okay. Chickens first.

502
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:02,385
My dear friends, welcome to
Mad Man Mooney's hubcap heaven.

503
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,985
Today is your lucky day.

504
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,360
- It is?
- Yes, it is. You, for example.

505
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,865
- You're drivin' the wrong car.
- I am?

506
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:14,166
I can put you in this German
street machine for only $2,000.

507
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:17,674
Less a $12 trade-in
on your old vehicle.

508
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,972
Now, this car is one
of the greatest...

509
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:26,213
Detachable fenders
for narrow garages.

510
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:27,444
No, thanks.

511
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,612
What is this pile of...
Jack, get rid of this heap.

512
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,747
Come out here!

513
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,415
What?
What, what?

514
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,518
What's the matter with you?
That's myJack.

515
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:41,531
- Hi, Jack.
- Jack not name. Jack job.

516
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,830
How many times have I told you
not to talk to the customers?

517
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:49,236
- Yeah, I know...
- Just move this. You understand?

518
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,477
Wow!

519
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:07,049
Friends, Mad Man Mooney doesn't believe
in all that dealing and wheeling.

520
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,684
No, the price on the sticker
is the price you pay.

521
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,921
And never more and never less.

522
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,893
We'll take that one for $11.95.

523
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,932
- What?
- Less our $12 trade-in.

524
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,996
You owe us a nickel.

525
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:30,741
Thank you very much. Hey, we're
all going to Hollywood. Wanna come?

526
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:35,275
- Hollywood!
- That's strange. He just ran away.

527
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,583
- Moving right along, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.

528
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:47,893
- Watch where you're going now, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.

529
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:51,196
Hey! Wait!
Where are ya goin'?

530
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:56,138
Hey! Wait for me!
I wanna go to Hollywood!

531
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,141
Hey! Wait for me!

532
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:01,042
Come on, guys!
Wait, please!

533
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,444
I wanna go to Hollywood!

534
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,714
Testing, one, two, three.
Testing. Can you hear me?

535
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:48,418
It's time to announce the winner of
this year's Bogen County Beauty Pageant.

536
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:54,555
- <i>We sure grow 'em pretty around here.</i>
- What's that?

537
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,566
<i>All right, here they are.</i>

538
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,932
- <i>The first runner-up...</i>
- What's over there?

539
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,461
- <i>is Debbie Sue Anderson.</i>
- See?

540
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:10,275
Nice-looking girls, huh?

541
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,714
- Wow! Nice-looking chickens.
- What?

542
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:16,014
- No hard feelings, honey.
- <i>Before announcing the winner...</i>

543
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,920
I think we should thank
the judges of today's contest...

544
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,480
Edgar Bergen
and Charlie McCarthy.

545
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:28,289
You're not gonna believe
who the winner is, folks.

546
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:32,097
- Come now, Charlie. It's their movie.
- So 'tis.

547
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:40,769
And here she is, folks,
this year's Miss Bogen County...

548
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:43,313
Miss Piggy!

549
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,485
Thank you.

550
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,817
Wow! It's a pig!
Did you see that?

551
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,382
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you.

552
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,356
Oh, Debbie Sue.

553
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:06,494
Oh, Ama Jane.
Thank you. Thank you.

554
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,067
Thank you.

555
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,900
Thank you.
Kissy-kissy.

556
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,537
Kissy-kissy.
Thank you.

557
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:18,275
- Kermit, you know...
- Not right now, Fozzie.

558
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:21,978
I just want to say one thing.

559
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:25,852
This is the happiest
moment of my...

560
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:41,966
<i>Never before</i>

561
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:45,270
<i>Have two souls joined so freely</i>

562
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:48,778
<i>And so fast</i>

563
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:54,341
<i>For me this is the first time</i>
<i>and the last</i>

564
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:58,752
<i>Is this an angel's wish</i>

565
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,417
<i>For men</i>

566
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,586
<i>Never before</i>

567
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:08,792
<i>And never again</i>

568
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:14,031
<i>And where to find the words</i>
<i>to sing its won'th</i>

569
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:18,703
<i>This love was bound for Heaven</i>

570
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,267
<i>Not for Earth</i>

571
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,575
<i>This love was meant</i>

572
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:28,346
<i>To light the stars</i>

573
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,353
<i>But when we touched</i>

574
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:35,290
<i>We made it ours</i>

575
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,520
<i>And could they take it back</i>

576
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:41,156
<i>Oh, no, they wouldn't dare</i>

577
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:44,531
<i>Why should they take it back</i>

578
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:48,003
<i>When there's enough</i>

579
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,371
<i>To share with all the world</i>

580
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:56,243
<i>And fill the heavens above</i>

581
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,611
<i>With leftover love</i>

582
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:02,209
<i>Never before</i>

583
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:05,346
<i>A love that keeps on growing</i>

584
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:08,755
<i>On and on</i>

585
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:11,420
<i>To fill each lover's heart</i>

586
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:14,623
<i>And light the dawn</i>

587
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,657
<i>Is this an angel's wish</i>

588
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:21,637
<i>For men</i>

589
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,572
<i>Never before</i>

590
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:29,978
<i>And never again</i>

591
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:37,314
<i>Never before</i>

592
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:43,293
<i>And never again</i>

593
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,145
Excuse me.

594
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,947
- Yes. Of course.
- Listen.

595
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,784
Congratulations on winning
the beauty contest.

596
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:17,987
Thank you. Of course, normally,
I don't do anything so trivial.

597
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:21,623
- I am an actress/model.
- Oh, is that right? Well, um...

598
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,997
I'm gonna be a performer too.

599
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,204
Hey, Kermit,
who's the cute-lookin' pig?

600
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,297
I beg your pardon.

601
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,740
If you were a chicken,
you'd be impeccable.

602
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,972
Hey, I thought we were
gonna go get some ice cream.

603
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:38,378
In a minute.
I'll join you.

604
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:46,846
Well, what are you doing in town...

605
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:50,189
short, green and handsome?

606
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:54,390
- Well, we're headed west.
- Really?

607
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,957
Yeah, but I should join
my friends for ice cream.

608
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,633
You want to come along?

609
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:05,197
Me? You mean it?
I'll be right back.

610
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:07,607
Don't move!

611
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:10,547
Hello, I'd like an ice cream.

612
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:12,947
Hello, I'd like an ice cream.

613
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,952
What do you want?
Chocolate, vanilla, coffee, peach fudge?

614
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,453
- Rum banana?
- Honey.

615
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:21,958
Honey? I beg your pardon.
I hardly know ya.

616
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,757
But seriously, I'd like
a honey ice-cream cone for me...

617
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,696
and a dragonfly ripple
for my friend, the frog.

618
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:33,135
Okay, one honey cone
for the bear.

619
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:35,865
- One dragonfly ripple for the frog.
- Yucky.

620
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,635
- Don't get 'em mixed up.
- Gotcha.

621
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,644
All right, Camilla,
I'll get you a balloon.

622
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:54,282
But you have to pick the color.
Red or green?

623
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,987
- Can I give you a word of advice?
- What?

624
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,463
Why not take both?

625
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,536
What a wild idea!

626
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:09,436
Yeah, a beautiful chicken
like that deserves two balloons.

627
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,838
You're right.
I have guys in all the time.

628
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,002
Sometimes they get a bunch
of balloons for their girls.

629
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:17,946
- They go gaga for it.
- Gaga? I'll take the whole bunch.

630
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:33,254
I wonder where they went?

631
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,967
- Where's your pig friend?
- I'm not really sure.

632
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,197
She said she was coming
for ice cream, but...

633
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:43,899
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!
Here I am!

634
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,534
Here I am! I'm packed!
I'm packed!

635
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:52,480
- Yeah, so I see. What for?
- You said I could come with you.

636
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:55,313
Yeah, but, to buy ice cream,
not to Hollywood.

637
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:59,048
- We're going to Hollywood!
- No! I mean, listen.

638
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,615
When I said...
Well, when you heard...

639
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,126
Oh, brother.

640
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:06,895
What?

641
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:16,798
- What are you doing?
- About seven knots.

642
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:22,710
- We'll follow you. To the car!
- Yes, sir!

643
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,305
Gonzo, we're coming!

644
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,976
- Step on it, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.

645
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:31,714
- Kermit, you're a born leader.
- Where is he?

646
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:36,989
Isn't this great?
Here I am, floating in space.

647
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:41,957
This is the place to be.
Whoopee!

648
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:45,195
- Fozzie, bear left.
- What?

649
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,896
- Bear left.
- Right, frog.

650
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,995
- What? That's cute.
- Never mind.

651
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:53,103
This is...
Look at our little car down there.

652
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:55,645
This is like flying.

653
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,874
Maybe this is flying.

654
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,713
I'm flying! Whoopee!

655
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:04,015
Doc, isn't that a frog up there?

656
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,318
No, that's a frog down here.

657
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,859
He's caught in a crosswind, Fozzie.
We're gonna lose him.

658
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,189
Oh, no!

659
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:17,496
- What are you doin', Doc?
- I'm goin' after their tires.

660
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:21,664
We're okay now. The wind shifted.
Wait a minute.

661
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:25,174
Stay with him, Fozzie.
He's right above us.

662
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,345
- He's okay.
- Yeah. Hi, Gonzo!

663
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:32,871
- Fozzie, come back in here!
- What? Yes, sir.

664
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:37,247
- Watch down the road!
- Kermit!

665
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:42,191
Look out for the billboard!

666
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:50,527
- Take off, Fozzie!
- Yes, sir!

667
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:53,536
Come back, you!

668
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,801
No frog's gonna make
a monkey outta me!

669
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:03,777
- I'm back.
- I don't understand any of this.

670
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,811
I just gotta
catch up with those guys!

671
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:19,628
Kermit. You were so courageous,
so magnificent.

672
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,455
Gee, I don't know what to say.

673
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:25,797
Say the bear was magnificent.
After all, I did the driving.

674
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:29,361
And I took a 100-foot belly flop
onto a moving car.

675
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:33,842
Yes, but, Kermit assumed
the awesome responsibility...

676
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,572
of command.

677
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:38,979
- Gee.
- Oh, brother.

678
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:43,015
Why don't we stop
somewhere for the night...

679
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:47,250
and have a quiet,
little dinner for two?

680
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:50,316
Terrific!
I'll eat with you, Miss Piggy.

681
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:53,192
Not you, buzzard beak!

682
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,197
Just <i>mon capitaine...</i>

683
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,290
and <i>moi.</i>

684
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:02,065
Well,
that might be nice.

685
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,475
Wow.

686
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:20,987
Good evening, Miss Piggy.
You look lovely tonight.

687
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,185
Thank you.

688
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,163
I'm so sorry
if I kept you waiting.

689
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,264
It was won'th it.

690
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,333
How charming of <i>vous.</i>

691
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:53,386
I took the liberty
of ordering us some wine.

692
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,251
Oh, waiter.

693
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,820
Yes?
May I help you?

694
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:04,162
The wine, please.

695
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:11,436
You mad, impetuous fink.
It's champagne.

696
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,238
Not exactly.
Sparkling muscatel.

697
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:18,407
One of the finest wines of Idaho.

698
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:23,078
- You may serve us now, please.
- May I?

699
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:29,251
- Look how he does that.
- Yeah. Pretty suave.

700
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:42,064
Don't you want to smell
the bottle cap?

701
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,033
- Smells good.
- Yeah.

702
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:49,772
Would you like
to taste it first?

703
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:52,076
Well...

704
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:56,984
- I think he's supposed to.
- Would you taste it for us, please?

705
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,933
Excellent choice.

706
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,096
Should be for 95 cents.

707
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:22,102
- And may we have straws, please?
- Yes.

708
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:25,171
I expected that.

709
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,443
Thank you.
That'll be all for now.

710
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:33,751
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

711
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:35,451
Thank you!

712
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:40,092
Here's to you, Miss Piggy.

713
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:41,755
Drink up.

714
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,618
Makes me giggly.

715
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:05,820
The wine?

716
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,991
Everything.

717
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,189
It's a beautiful evening,
isn't it?

718
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,894
Uh-huh.

719
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,597
And the moon
is just lovely.

720
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,935
But you know, Miss Piggy...

721
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:31,105
the moon doesn't look like you.

722
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:43,257
Miss Piggy! Miss Piggy!

723
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,762
- Are you Miss Piggy?
- Yes?

724
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,388
Telephone.

725
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:57,998
I did place one phone call
to my agent.

726
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:02,238
It'll only be
an eensy-teensy moment.

727
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,851
What the hey.

728
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:32,106
Evenin'.
Rowlf. Rowlf the Dog.

729
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:34,405
Sit yourself down.

730
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:37,105
- Kermit. Kermit the Frog.
- Pleased to meet ya.

731
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,978
I'm no Heifetz,
but I get by.

732
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,318
That was...
That was very nice.

733
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,291
Whoa, hey,
broken heart, right?

734
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,488
Does it show?

735
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:56,965
Listen, when you've been ticklin'
the ivories as long as I have...

736
00:53:57,033 --> 00:54:00,059
you've seen a broken heart
for every drop of rain.

737
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:03,003
A shattered dream
for every fallen star.

738
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,873
Exactly.
She just walked out on me.

739
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:12,210
- Typical. That's why I live alone.
- You do, huh?

740
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:14,147
You bet.

741
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:17,084
I finish work,
I go home, read a book...

742
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:20,748
have a couple of beers,
take myself for a walk and go to bed.

743
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,792
Nice and simple.

744
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:27,193
- Stay away from women. That's my motto.
- But I can't.

745
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,199
Neither can I.
That's my trouble.

746
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,127
<i>You can't live with 'em</i>

747
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,468
<i>You can't live without 'em</i>

748
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:40,805
<i>There's something</i>
<i>irresistible-ish about 'em</i>

749
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:44,404
<i>We grin and bear it</i>
<i>'cause the nights are long</i>

750
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:47,279
<i>I hope that somethin'better</i>
<i>comes along</i>

751
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:50,542
I see what you mean.

752
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,420
<i>It's no good complainin'</i>
<i>and pointless to holler</i>

753
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:58,523
<i>If she's a beauty</i>
<i>she'll get under your collar</i>

754
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:02,288
<i>She made a monkey</i>
<i>out of old King Kong</i>

755
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:05,630
<i>I hope that somethin'better</i>
<i>comes along</i>

756
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:10,738
<i>Still, it's fun</i>
<i>when you're fetchin'</i>

757
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,741
<i>And agree to see an etching</i>

758
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:16,438
<i>That you keep at your lily pad</i>

759
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:20,449
<i>There is no solution</i>
<i>It's part of evolution</i>

760
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:22,451
<i>The pitter patter of soles</i>

761
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:24,612
<i>The little feet of tadpoles</i>

762
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:27,623
Rowlf, tadpoles don't have feet.

763
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:30,683
Sorry about that.
Two, three, four.

764
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:35,254
<i>There's no limitation</i>
<i>to mixin'and matchin'</i>

765
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:39,063
<i>Some get an itchin'for a critter</i>
<i>they've been scratchin'</i>

766
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:42,627
<i>A skunk was badgered</i>
<i>The results were strong</i>

767
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:44,640
<i>I hope that something better</i>

768
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,699
<i>I hope that something better</i>

769
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:52,681
<i>I hope that something better</i>
<i>comes along</i>

770
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:03,292
Phone call for Kermit the Frog!

771
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,227
- You Kermit the Frog?
- Yeah.

772
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:07,388
Phone.

773
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:17,533
It's not that often you see a guy
that green have the blues that bad.

774
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:24,012
Kermie, please!

775
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:28,478
- Piggy, is that you?
- <i>Yes, that's her.</i>

776
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:32,749
<i>And this is Doc Hopper.</i>
<i>Now you listen, frog, and listen good.</i>

777
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:37,691
Step outside the motel right now.
My guys'll meet you there.

778
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:41,387
Well,
what if I don't?

779
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:44,797
Then your girlfriend
will be ham hocks by breakfast.

780
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,337
Kermie, don't, don't!

781
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,414
Are you the guys
I'm supposed to meet?

782
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:13,160
Good, Glen. That's good.
Nice and tight.

783
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:19,364
- The professor's here, Doc.
- Show him in. Show him in.

784
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:24,437
Kermie, I'm not a bit worried.

785
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:28,841
I know you're planning
something bold and clever.

786
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:31,676
Well, I got us
this far, didn't I?

787
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,785
- How are you?
- Professor Krassman.

788
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:42,086
It's good to see you, Doc,
you little rustic devil, you.

789
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:45,821
Where's my victim?
I mean, patient.

790
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:47,829
- Step this way, Professor.
- Of course.

791
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:50,957
Let me introduce you
to your patient.

792
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:53,298
Prof. Krassman is
the world's leading authority...

793
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:55,769
on mind control in frogs.

794
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:00,469
It's a very rapidly growing field.
You like garlic, don't you?

795
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:03,444
Tell us what you're gonna do
to our little Kermit.

796
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:08,473
Well, we're going to perform
an electronic "cerebrectomy."

797
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:11,816
- A what?
- An electronic cerebrectomy!

798
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:16,058
What's that?

799
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:19,788
It's something so sensational
that you'll have to hold on to your hat.

800
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,024
- Yes?
- When a German scientist says...

801
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:24,259
"Hold on to your hat,"
it's not casual conversation.

802
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,894
Hold on to your hat!
Hat, hold! Good!

803
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:30,337
Now, what we're going to do is bring out
a machine that's going to wow you.

804
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:33,170
Bertram, Bertram,
bring out the machine!

805
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,609
Wait till you see this. You think
we're sleeping in Dusseldorf?

806
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,909
You think we're taking a nap
in Cologne? No, we're working at night.

807
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:42,349
Each night, a new dial,
a new knob, a diode.

808
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:45,683
- Electronic ce...
- Cerebrectomy.

809
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:49,191
- Electronic cerebrectomy.
- What does it do?

810
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:51,352
What does it do?

811
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:54,191
It turns the brains into guacamole.

812
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,835
First of all,
I'll pull out of this, okay?

813
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:01,837
Wonderful.

814
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:04,999
Second?

815
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:11,044
Halt!

816
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:13,708
I detest the surfeit
of provincial laughter.

817
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:17,480
Now, we take your friend,
the little "F-O-R-G"...

818
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,318
put him in the chair,
clamp on the terminals...

819
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,585
drop the electronic yarmulke...

820
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:25,594
and throw, what we call
in German, the switch.

821
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:30,724
Yes, you little green devil...

822
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,930
soon it'll be a hot time
at the old skull tonight.

823
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:38,303
Thank you, Herr Machine.
Now, the frog will do your bidding.

824
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:42,037
He will do your every whim, He will do
your television commercial, yes.

825
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:46,207
He will sell your frogs' legs.

826
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:48,614
- Zaparooni.
- Head full of jelly.

827
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:52,883
- A noggin full of library paste!
- Let's fry them brains!

828
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:56,050
- You've got a fun job.
- I love it, I love it.

829
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:59,925
If I could inflict a little pain during
the afternoon, I sleep good at night.

830
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,464
- We'll let you get on with it, then.
- My pleasure.

831
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,762
Max.

832
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:09,100
I'll be back later
to pick up what's left of the frog.

833
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:12,835
"What's left of the frog." You can have
everything, excuse the brain.

834
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:15,434
All right.
Bring over the frog.

835
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:19,875
Kermie, whatever happens next...

836
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:23,646
I wouldn't give up
this evening together for anything.

837
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,655
- Would you?
- Make me an offer.

838
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:34,920
Okay, I got him.
I got him.

839
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:37,466
Good, good.

840
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:40,024
And why don't we take
a little seat, Kermit?

841
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:42,594
Hold his hands down.

842
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:45,664
Get your feeties in place.

843
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:48,040
Will you
stop whimpering?

844
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:50,739
Go out like a frog,
not a little toad.

845
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:55,477
Okay, Herr Machine, this is
big time here. Ready to go to work?

846
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:57,746
Hand clamps!

847
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,685
Foot clamps!

848
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,620
You can struggle
all you want now, frog.

849
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:08,061
It'll do you
very little good.

850
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:11,225
All right. And now
it's time to drop...

851
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,234
the electronic beanie.

852
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:18,429
Soon there'll be enough voltage coursing
through your little frog brain...

853
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,375
to light up Cincinnati.

854
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:25,039
- Here we go.
- Oh, please! Not my frog, please!

855
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:29,244
- Say good-bye to the frog, pig.
- Why should I?

856
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:34,381
Because in ten seconds,
he won't know you from kosher bacon.

857
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,391
That does it!

858
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:03,585
What the heck's goin' on here?

859
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:06,713
A pig that goes bananas?
What is this, a luau?

860
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:08,757
Where'd she go?

861
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,850
Oh, boys.

862
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:12,918
There she is! Get her!

863
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,533
I must reach the switch.
I must!

864
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,591
- Switch... I must reach...
- Oh, no.

865
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,144
- Now, Kermie.
- Thank you.

866
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:42,691
Well...

867
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,727
shall we go now, Kermie?

868
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:50,792
Well...
Just a second.

869
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:58,666
What?
Piggy, it's your agent.

870
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:02,777
Thank you.

871
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:06,607
Yeah, Morty.
What have you got?

872
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:07,979
Commercial?

873
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:13,488
How much? When?

874
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:15,683
Take it.

875
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:26,201
Good-bye!

876
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:46,377
What happened?

877
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:51,189
Flip, flip, flip, flip.

878
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,655
Don't worry, Animal.
Your big scene is coming up.

879
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:01,328
Yeah, yeah. Just be cool and
eat another seat cushion.

880
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,338
Seat cushion!

881
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:08,944
Well, how do you
like the film?

882
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:13,107
I've seen detergents that
leave a better film than this.

883
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:17,380
I don't care what anybody else says.
I'm having a great time.

884
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,284
Oh, good.

885
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:24,186
- The "flim" is okey-dokey.
- Good. Roll film.

886
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,251
"Flim" is "rooling."

887
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,297
Quiet, quiet.

888
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:33,165
This is the patriotic part.

889
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:36,069
- Should we stand up?
- No.

890
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:41,772
<i>Oh, beautiful</i>
<i>for spacious skies</i>

891
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:45,940
<i>For amber waves of grain</i>

892
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:50,281
<i>For purple mountains'majesties</i>

893
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:54,756
<i>Above the fruited plain</i>

894
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:59,124
<i>America, America</i>

895
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:03,564
<i>God shed His grace on thee</i>

896
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:08,070
<i>And crown thy good</i>
<i>with brotherhood</i>

897
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:10,537
<i>From sea to</i>

898
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:14,167
<i>Shining sea</i>

899
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,943
Patriotism swells in the heart
of the American bear.

900
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:38,028
Hold it, boys. Hold it!

901
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,034
Hold your fire!

902
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,937
Now, boys, no reflection
on the job you been doin'...

903
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:47,441
but I decided
to bring in a specialist.

904
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,222
Now, boys,
this is Snake Walker.

905
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,486
Tell 'em what you do, Snake.

906
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,354
Kill frogs.

907
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:18,502
- How long is it to Hollywood?
- We gotta be there by tomorrow.

908
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:21,509
Hey, Kermit! Are you going to
get an agent like that pig had?

909
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:24,307
Gonzo, you know
he's touchy about that.

910
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,041
- Hey, who's that? I don't believe that.
- Oh, no.

911
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:34,887
- That's Piggy.
- Yeah, I know.

912
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,782
Do you think we should
help her with her bag?

913
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:46,530
Oh, Kermie!
What an unbelievable coincidence!

914
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:53,170
Hello again.
It's me!

915
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,506
Would you hold
my laundry case?

916
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:01,045
- Well.
- Well what?

917
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,677
So much has happened to me
since I saw you last.

918
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:08,349
Frankly, Miss Piggy,
I don't give a hoot.

919
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:12,793
My name is Rowlf the Dog, and I was
playin' the piano in a... Oh, never mind.

920
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:20,535
I missed you.

921
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:25,998
Don't I get
one kissy-kissy?

922
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:29,408
I don't think so, Miss Piggy.

923
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,878
Just one little hug?

924
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:41,579
<i>You've been listening</i>
<i>to music to hug frogs by...</i>

925
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:44,148
<i>and this is Doc Hopper sayin'</i>
<i>that if Kermit the Frog...</i>

926
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,353
don't stop right now and call me...

927
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:50,388
and agree to be my national spokesman,
he will soon be a frogburger.

928
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:57,566
- We'll be okay.
- Oh, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

929
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:06,905
Oh, boy. Yeah.
What? No problem!

930
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:10,748
It's okay, it's okay.
No problem. Hey, all right!

931
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:16,482
We're in trouble.

932
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:19,119
I wish I still had
my Studebaker.

933
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:21,663
There's probably somethin'
broken about the engine.

934
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:24,563
Hey, don't worry.
Someone's bound to come along.

935
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:26,066
Yeah?

936
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,987
Well, I guess we blew it,
huh, Gonzo?

937
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:49,991
Yeah.

938
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:54,687
But the sky sure is
beautiful out here.

939
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:56,697
Look at that.

940
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:03,938
We're gonna miss
the auditions tomorrow, right?

941
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:18,416
Boy, you could get lost
in a sky like that.

942
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:23,047
I wish I had
those balloons again.

943
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:26,322
So much for Hollywood.

944
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:30,792
Listen, gang.
I never promised we'd make it.

945
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:33,767
I never promised anything.

946
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:45,372
<i>This looks familiar</i>

947
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:49,747
<i>Vaguely familiar</i>

948
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:54,380
<i>Almost unreal, yet</i>

949
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:58,825
<i>It's too soon to feel yet</i>

950
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:02,057
<i>Close to my soul</i>

951
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:06,761
<i>And yet so far away</i>

952
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:12,296
<i>I'm going to go</i>
<i>back there someday</i>

953
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:19,808
<i>Sun rises, night falls</i>

954
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:24,046
<i>Sometimes the sky calls</i>

955
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,850
<i>Is that a song there</i>

956
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:31,188
<i>And do I belong there</i>

957
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:35,788
<i>I've never been there</i>

958
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:38,833
<i>But I know the way</i>

959
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:43,668
<i>I'm going to go back there</i>

960
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,866
<i>Someday</i>

961
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:51,807
<i>Come and go with me</i>

962
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,849
<i>It's more fun to share</i>

963
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:59,577
<i>We'll both be completely</i>

964
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:03,022
<i>At home in midair</i>

965
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:07,358
<i>We're flyin', not walking</i>

966
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:10,830
<i>On featherless wings</i>

967
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:14,801
<i>We can hold on to young</i>

968
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:18,533
<i>Like invisible string</i>

969
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:27,907
<i>There's not a word yet</i>

970
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:32,511
<i>For old friends who've just met</i>

971
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:36,547
<i>Part heaven, part space</i>

972
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:41,187
<i>Or have I found my place</i>

973
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:44,755
<i>You can just visit</i>

974
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:48,701
<i>But I plan to stay</i>

975
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:54,072
<i>I'm going to go back there</i>

976
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:57,078
<i>Someday</i>

977
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:04,583
<i>I'm going to go back there</i>

978
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:07,121
<i>Someday</i>

979
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:44,524
I didn't promise anybody anything.

980
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,963
What do I know
about Hollywood anyway?

981
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:52,899
Just the dreams I got from sitting
through too many double features.

982
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:55,869
<i>So why did you leave the swamp</i>
<i>in the first place?</i>

983
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:59,101
'Cause some agent fella
said I had talent.

984
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:01,165
He probably says that
to everybody.

985
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:03,768
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>if you hadn't left the swamp...</i>

986
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:06,474
<i>you'd be feeling</i>
<i>pretty miserable anyhow.</i>

987
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:10,882
Yeah, but then it would
just be me feelin' miserable.

988
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:14,047
Now I got a lady pig
and a bear and a chicken...

989
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:17,217
a dog, a thing...
whatever Gonzo is.

990
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:21,092
- He's a little like a turkey.
- Yeah, A little like a turkey.

991
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,563
- But not much.
- No, I guess not.

992
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:26,226
Anyhow, I brought 'em all out here
into the middle of nowhere.

993
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:28,269
It's all my fault.

994
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,771
Still...

995
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:32,830
whether you promised them
something or not...

996
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:36,571
you gotta remember
they wanted to come.

997
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:39,079
But that's because
they believed in me.

998
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:41,673
No, they believed
in the dream.

999
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:44,913
- Well, so do I, but...
- You do?

1000
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:48,514
- Yeah. Of course I do.
- Well, then?

1001
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,990
Well, then...

1002
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:53,926
I guess I was wrong
when I said I never promised anyone.

1003
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,065
I promised me.

1004
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,776
Hey, now, wait a minute.

1005
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:25,259
Hey, what's happening?

1006
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:28,125
At the moment,
we're what's happening.

1007
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:32,592
Oh, great!
Wonderful! Yeah!

1008
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:35,102
Zoot! Hey, Zoot!

1009
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:38,503
Hold it, hold it.
Animal, cool it back there.

1010
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:41,008
Yeah.

1011
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:43,772
All right, yeah.

1012
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:47,179
Hey, it's wonderful to see you,
but how did you ever find us?

1013
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:50,343
Oh, easy. We just read
the screenplay you left us.

1014
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:53,855
"Exterior desert, night."
We knew right where you were.

1015
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:55,947
Like, can you get behind it?

1016
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:58,584
Hey, when you dudes
have to be at that audition?

1017
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,686
- 2:00 tomorrow afternoon.
- Well, climb aboard the bus.

1018
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:04,197
We'll have breakfast
at Hollywood and Vine.

1019
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,573
<i>Movin'right along</i>

1020
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:15,940
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1021
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,876
Here we go.

1022
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:22,106
<i>Movin'right along</i>

1023
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:36,127
Kermie, whisper sweet nothings
into my ear.

1024
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,632
Motorcycle cop.

1025
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,827
"Motorcycle cop"
is a sweet nothing?

1026
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:43,337
A motorcycle cop is chasing us.

1027
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,141
Hey, Dr. Teeth,
you better pull over.

1028
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:51,043
Hey, easier done than said.

1029
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:56,482
- Drag city.
- What do we do now?

1030
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,085
Oh, dear.

1031
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:03,090
Hey, hey. The man with the badge.
The police.

1032
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:05,854
The cops, the fuzz, the P-l...

1033
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:09,557
- Don't you dare.
- I wouldn't think of it.

1034
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,568
Did we do something
wrong, Officer?

1035
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:21,571
- Kermie, it's him!
- Okay, gang. Let him explain.

1036
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:24,669
This whole disguise is
only so I could warn you.

1037
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,771
Yeah. Sure, sure.

1038
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:31,012
I never thought Doc would hurt Kermit.
I thought he was gonna lean on him.

1039
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,953
But now he's got this
frog killer in from the coast...

1040
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:35,956
and the man is deadly!

1041
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:38,049
Oh, no. Kermit,
what are we gonna do?

1042
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:40,924
It's time to beat feet,
green stuff.

1043
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:43,692
I love it. Chase music is
one of our best riffs.

1044
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:46,233
Hold it, Dr. Teeth.
What's up ahead?

1045
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:49,498
- Only an old ghost town.
- Fine.

1046
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:52,870
Listen, you go tell Doc Hopper
I'll be waiting for him there.

1047
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:56,104
- What?
- Kermit, you'll get killed!

1048
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:59,113
Listen, guys. Listen.

1049
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:01,809
I can't spend my whole life
running away from a bully.

1050
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:04,317
It's time for a showdown.

1051
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:22,695
Chugga, chugga.

1052
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:36,475
Hey, listen.
I'm gonna check things out.

1053
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:38,985
Everybody stay
on the bus, okay?

1054
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,352
- Hey, Kermit?
- Yeah?

1055
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:47,827
Can I take Animal for a walk?
He needs some exercise.

1056
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:49,830
Yeah, sure.

1057
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:09,308
What is that?

1058
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:13,946
That's one of my latest inventions...
a musical rotating rain barrel.

1059
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,490
- Oh, yeah.
- You see...

1060
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:21,052
I'm Dr. Bunsen Honeydew,
and this is my assistant, Beaker.

1061
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:23,757
We live here,
perfecting useful inventions.

1062
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:25,823
Come in, come in.

1063
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:32,540
Welcome to our laboratory.

1064
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:37,435
Please don't touch anything.

1065
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:43,912
Is this the only street into town?

1066
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:45,919
Yes, yes.

1067
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,917
Hey, what are you dudes
doin' in here?

1068
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,117
I'm so glad you asked!

1069
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:53,593
We're perfecting
our latest invention...

1070
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:56,392
insta-grow pills.

1071
01:18:56,465 --> 01:19:00,060
Well, what in the name
of Fats Waller is that?

1072
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:04,133
A four-foot prune!

1073
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:06,504
A four-foot prune.

1074
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:10,238
Yeah, man. Well, what else
do these pills make big?

1075
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:12,280
They work on anything.

1076
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:14,645
But the effect is,
sadly, temporary.

1077
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:16,479
Sadly temporary.

1078
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:28,662
Hey, Kermit!
Here comes Doc Hopper!

1079
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:31,324
I know.
I'll be ready for him.

1080
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:39,939
Okay, frog. Where are ya?

1081
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,335
I'm here. I'll meet you
in the middle of the street.

1082
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:47,438
- Oh, yeah?
- Man to frog.

1083
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:10,732
- All right, Hopper.
- All right, frog.

1084
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,934
One last chance.

1085
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:17,467
You can do my TV commercials
live or stuffed.

1086
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:22,449
What's the matter with you?

1087
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:24,883
You gotta be crazy chasin' me
halfway across the country.

1088
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:26,887
Why are you doin' this to me?

1089
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:31,987
'Cause all my life I wanted to own
a thousand frog-leg restaurants...

1090
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,994
and you're the key, greenie.

1091
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:36,257
Yeah, well,
I've got a dream too.

1092
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:39,858
But it's about singing and
dancing and making people happy.

1093
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:43,530
The kind of dream that gets better
the more people you share it with.

1094
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:51,205
And, well, I've found a whole bunch
of friends who have the same dream.

1095
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:54,305
And it kind of
makes us like a family.

1096
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:56,247
You have anybody
like that, Hopper?

1097
01:20:56,318 --> 01:20:59,515
Once you get all those restaurants,
who're you gonna share it with?

1098
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:03,922
Who are your friends, Doc?
Those guys?

1099
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:10,591
I got lots of friends.

1100
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:14,368
Max, for instance.

1101
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:20,440
- Max.
- I don't think you're a bad man, Doc.

1102
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:22,738
I think if you look
in your heart...

1103
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:25,541
you'll find you really want
to let me and my friends go...

1104
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:27,741
to follow our dream.

1105
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:31,377
But if that's not
the kind of man you are...

1106
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:34,786
and if what I'm saying
doesn't make any sense to you...

1107
01:21:34,856 --> 01:21:38,656
well, then,
go ahead and kill me.

1108
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,841
All right, boys.

1109
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,171
Kill him.

1110
01:21:57,178 --> 01:21:58,304
No, wait, please!

1111
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:54,858
- Everybody goin' to Hollywood?
- Yeah!

1112
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,843
Next stop is
Hollywood and Vine.

1113
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:20,259
Look at the ocean!
The ocean!

1114
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:26,463
Yes, Mr. Lord. I'll have those
deal memos for you in a jiffy.

1115
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:34,297
I'm sorry.

1116
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:38,107
Mr. Lord can't be disturbed by anyone.
He's packaging a blockbuster.

1117
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:45,084
Look! It's wonderful!
Like a dream come true.

1118
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:48,919
Don't count your tadpoles until they're
hatched. I still have to audition.

1119
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:51,515
Hey, ain't nothin' to it
but to do it.

1120
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:57,529
And where do you think
you're going?

1121
01:23:57,599 --> 01:24:01,262
Hi, there!
I'm going to audition for Lew Lord.

1122
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:04,271
You can't just walk in here
off the street, you know.

1123
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:06,432
Especially not with
all these animals.

1124
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:08,601
Animals?
What's wrong with animals?

1125
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:15,310
This is a movie studio,
not a zoo!

1126
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:17,248
Besides...

1127
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:23,318
I'm allergic to animal hair.
Now, get along, all of you.

1128
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,723
Now, wait a second.
See here, miss.

1129
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:29,252
I may not be one of your fancy
Hollywood frogs, but I deserve a chance.

1130
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:32,891
We're going to stay here until you let
us in to see Lew Lord, aren't we, gang?

1131
01:24:32,967 --> 01:24:35,060
Yes! Yes!

1132
01:24:35,136 --> 01:24:38,128
- Yeah, come on!
- We're gonna sit right down and wait.

1133
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:41,972
Yes, Security? Miss Tracy.

1134
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:44,204
I want to report a...

1135
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:46,713
Shake! Shake, everyone!

1136
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:49,375
- That's it!
- Look what it's doing!

1137
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:51,976
- Go get 'em, man!
- Way to go!

1138
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:54,487
Allergies are nothing
to sneeze at.

1139
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:56,717
I'm allergic to cats, myself.

1140
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:09,603
Okay, way to go, guys!

1141
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:11,605
Thanks, miss.

1142
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:16,443
Well, friends...

1143
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:19,036
this is it.

1144
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:39,366
Mr. Lord? Forgive the interruption,
but I'm here to audition.

1145
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:41,197
Yes, yes.

1146
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:45,035
We've come over 2,000 miles just...

1147
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:47,770
Oh, boy.

1148
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:54,243
We're all with you.

1149
01:25:56,718 --> 01:26:00,051
Please, sir, my name is Kermit the Frog,
and we read your ad...

1150
01:26:00,121 --> 01:26:03,284
and, well, we've come
to be rich and famous.

1151
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,604
Miss Tracy...

1152
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:25,043
prepare the standard
"Rich and Famous" contract...

1153
01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:27,741
for Kermit the Frog and company.

1154
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:47,896
Just look at all this.

1155
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:51,029
How did a frog
make the big time?

1156
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:03,611
It starts when we're kids.

1157
01:27:04,686 --> 01:27:07,553
<i>A show-off at school</i>

1158

<i>and bad imitations</i>

<i>There's that dedication</i>

<i>Working the mirror</i>

All right, everybody,
production number, okay?

1172
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:57,901
Off the trucks
and on the job!

1173
01:27:57,972 --> 01:28:00,463
- On the job!
- Hey, whoa! Aw, geez...

1174
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:03,009
Wow, let's do it!

1175
01:28:03,077 --> 01:28:05,102
- Do what?
- The movie!

1176
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:08,273
- Yes, sir! A footstomper!
- Makeup!

1177

- Yes! Let's do it!
- Fozzie, take those wagons out of there.

1178
01:28:13,421 --> 01:28:15,582
Yes, sir. I'm off.

Scenery over there. Great.

1180

Moving right along. Hey!

1181
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:30,326
Hey, those are
the trees for the swamp.

1182
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:32,839
Mellow and profitable.

1183

- Let's make the scene!
- Okay, hon.

1184

- Watch the tree, Rowlf.
- Careful, Scooter.

1185
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:47,621
Watch it!

1186
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:50,089
Miss Piggy,
you look beautiful.

1187
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:52,524
- Thank you!
- Hollywood talk.

1188
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,031
Good.

1189

The lights... Yeah.

1190
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:01,935
Good. Save those arcs.
