{3533}{3626}"Even if you accept the belief that a high|Trendex means a rising sales curve...."
{3627}{3663}-Mr. Thornhill?|-Good night, Eddie.
{3664}{3723}-Say hello to the missus.|-We're not talking.
{3724}{3771}"My recommendation is still the same.
{3773}{3846}"Spread the good word in as many|small time segments as we can.
{3848}{3939}"Let the opposition have their high ratings|while we cry all the way to the bank.
{3941}{4008}"Let's colonize at the Colony|one day next week for lunch.
{4010}{4072}"Let me hear from you, Sam.|Happy thoughts, etc...."
{4074}{4112}You better walk me to the Plaza.
{4114}{4191}-I didn't put a coat on.|-Use your blood sugar, child. Come on.
{4193}{4229}-Next?|-Gretchen Sabinson.
{4231}{4248}Oh, yes.
{4250}{4320}Send her a box of candy from Blum's.|$10. You know the kind.
{4322}{4407}Each piece wrapped in gold paper.|She'll think she's eating money.
{4409}{4475}Just tell her:|"Darling, I count the days, the hours--"
{4476}{4526}-You sent that one last time.|-I did?
{4527}{4626}Put: "Something for your sweet tooth,|baby, and all your other sweet parts! "
{4631}{4651}I know.
{4653}{4683}Could we take a cab?
{4685}{4737}-For two blocks?|-You're late and I'm tired.
{4739}{4803}That's your trouble, Maggie,|you don't eat properly.
{4805}{4830}Here. Taxi.
{4856}{4921}I have a very sick woman here.|You don't mind, do you?
{4923}{4952}Thank you very much.
{4954}{4990}Perfectly all right.
{5000}{5055}First stop, the Plaza. Don't throw the flag.
{5056}{5080}Poor man.
{5108}{5185}I made him a happy man.|I made him feel like a good Samaritan.
{5187}{5227}He knew you were lying.
{5257}{5326}In the world of advertising,|there's no such thing as a lie.
{5327}{5410}There's only "the expedient exaggeration."|You ought to know that.
{5420}{5467}Do I look heavyish to you?
{5469}{5491}What?
{5492}{5525}I feel heavyish.
{5528}{5592}Put a note on my desk in the morning:|"Think thin."
{5594}{5625}"Think thin."
{5640}{5695}Better make it the 59th Street entrance.
{5696}{5715}Okay.
{5740}{5787}Soon as you get back, call my mother.
{5788}{5846}Remind her we have theatre tickets|for tonight.
{5847}{5891}Dinner at 21, 7:00.
{5894}{5993}I'll have had two martini's at the Oak Bar|so she needn't bother to sniff my breath.
{5995}{6062}-She doesn't do that.|-Sure she does. Like a bloodhound.
{6063}{6154}Bigelow at 10:30 is your first for tomorrow.|The Skin Glow rehearsal's at noon.
{6156}{6202}Then lunch with Falcon and his wife.
{6204}{6266}-Where was that?|-Larry and Arnold's, 1 :00.
{6276}{6336}-Will you check in later?|-Absolutely not.
{6370}{6435}Here, Driver. Take this lady|back where she belongs.
{6437}{6485}-Right.|-That ought to cover it.
{6505}{6564}-Don't forget, call my mother right away.|-I won't.
{6566}{6631}-Good night, Mr. Thornhill.|-Good night.
{6700}{6772}Wait, Maggie! You can't call her.|She's at Mrs.--
{7307}{7341}Good evening, Mr. Thornhill.
{7343}{7401}I'm looking for Mr. Weltner|and two other gentlemen.
{7403}{7444}Yes, sir. Right this way.
{7470}{7488}Herman.
{7490}{7531}-Hello, Roger.|-I'm a little late.
{7533}{7575}Roger Thornhill. Fanning Nelson.
{7625}{7703}-We've gotten a head start here.|-That won't last long.
{7705}{7811}I was saying that you may be slow|in starting, but there's nobody faster.
{7813}{7865}What's the matter? You've got the fidgets.
{7867}{7983}I told my secretary to call Mother and|I realized she won't be able to reach her.
{7989}{8007}Why not?
{8009}{8063}She's playing bridge at one of her cronies'.
{8064}{8105}-Your secretary?|-No. My mother.
{8107}{8129}Mr. Kaplan?
{8131}{8206}It's one of those new apartments,|wet paint and no telephone yet.
{8211}{8259}Perhaps if I send her a telegram.
{8260}{8293}Mr. George Kaplan?
{8295}{8315}Boy!
{8454}{8472}Kaplan.
{8474}{8510}I have to send a wire.
{8512}{8571}Could you send it for me|if I write it out for you?
{8573}{8647}I'm not permitted to do that, sir,|but if you'll follow me....
{8651}{8703}-Will you excuse me?|-Go right ahead.
{8790}{8834}-Right through there, sir.|-Thanks.
{8835}{8867}Thank you, sir.
{8923}{8964}What's that supposed to be?
{8966}{9050}The car is waiting outside.|You'll walk between us saying nothing.
{9051}{9107}-What are you talking about?|-Let's go.
{9114}{9147}Go where? Who....
{9163}{9185}Who are you?
{9187}{9240}Mere errand boys,|carrying concealed weapons.
{9242}{9336}His is pointed at your heart, so, please,|no errors of judgment, I beg of you.
{9338}{9382}What is this? A joke or something?
{9383}{9442}Yes, a joke. We'll laugh in the car.
{9447}{9467}Come.
{9469}{9504}This is ridiculous.
{10009}{10082}Don't tell me where we're going.|Surprise me.
{10128}{10194}I left some friends|back there in the Oak Bar.
{10195}{10243}They'll think I'm awfully rude.
{10245}{10315}Could we stop off|at a drugstore for a moment...
{10317}{10394}...so that I could explain|I'm being kidnapped?
{10423}{10483}Well, that is what's happening, isn't it?
{10707}{10732}Locked.
{10836}{10880}TOWNSEND
{11046}{11078}Who's Townsend?
{11136}{11160}Really?
{11179}{11207}Interesting.
{12275}{12323}-Where is he?|-Upstairs, dressing.
{12325}{12386}-Tell him I'm here.|-The dinner guests are expected.
{12387}{12437}Never mind that. Say to him: "Kaplan."
{12439}{12495}By the way,|what are we having for dessert?
{12496}{12537}-Is anyone in the library?|-No.
{12539}{12563}This way.
{12843}{12871}You will wait here.
{12873}{12944}Don't hurry. I'll catch up on my reading.
{13410}{13467}MR. LESTER TOWNSEND|169 BAYWOOD, GLEN COVE, N.Y.
{13971}{14004}Good evening.
{14558}{14616}Not what I expected. A little taller...
{14642}{14702}...a little more polished than the others.
{14725}{14794}I'm so glad you're pleased, Mr. Townsend.
{14795}{14853}But, I'm afraid, just as obvious.
{14889}{14958}What the devil is all this about?|Why was I brought here?
{15010}{15058}Games? Must we?
{15101}{15209}Not that I mind a slight case of abduction,|but I have tickets for the theatre tonight.
{15211}{15255}To a show I was looking forward to.
{15256}{15316}I get unreasonable about things like that.
{15327}{15417}With such expert play-acting,|you make this very room a theatre.
{15449}{15526}Leonard, have you met|our distinguished guest?
{15572}{15616}He's a well-tailored one, isn't he?
{15626}{15705}My secretary is a great admirer|of your methods, Mr. Kaplan.
{15715}{15759}Elusiveness, however misguided--
{15761}{15795}Wait a minute.
{15813}{15847}Did you call me "Kaplan"?
{15849}{15954}I know you're a man of many names,|but I'll accept your current choice.
{15957}{15987}Current choice?
{15991}{16076}My name is Roger Thornhill.|It's never been anything else.
{16078}{16107}Of course.
{16126}{16220}Your friends picked up the wrong package|when they bundled me out here in the car.
{16222}{16265}Sit down, Mr. Kaplan.
{16275}{16344}I told you, I'm not Kaplan, whoever he is.
{16361}{16391}-Excuse me.|-Yes?
{16392}{16426}The guests are here, dear.
{16427}{16494}Look after them.|I'll be with you in a few minutes.
{16549}{16600}Now, shall we get down to business?
{16602}{16628}I'm all for that.
{16630}{16713}Simply, I'd like you to tell me|how much you know of our arrangements...
{16715}{16766}...and how you've come by|this information.
{16768}{16831}-I don't expect to get this for nothing.|-Of course not.
{16833}{16860}Don't misunderstand.
{16862}{16924}I don't expect you to fall in|with the suggestion...
{16926}{17031}...but the least I can do is afford you|the opportunity of surviving the evening.
{17111}{17158}What is that supposed to mean?
{17159}{17225}Why don't you surprise me,|Mr. Kaplan, and say yes?
{17227}{17254}I've told you--
{17255}{17296}We know where you're headed for.
{17298}{17379}I know where I'm headed.|The Winter Garden Theatre in New York.
{17380}{17433}And I think I'd better get going.
{17638}{17689}Townsend,|you're making a serious mistake.
{17701}{17786}This is not going to lead|to a very happy conclusion, Mr. Kaplan.
{17792}{17827}I'm not Kaplan!
{17828}{17868}I do wish you would reconsider.
{17870}{17966}We also know your contact in Pittsburgh|since Jason committed suicide.
{17983}{18056}What contact?|I've never been in Pittsburgh.
{18078}{18161}On June 16, you checked|into the Sherwyn Hotel in Pittsburgh...
{18163}{18222}...as Mr. George Kaplan|of Berkeley, California.
{18224}{18295}A week later, you registered|at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel...
{18296}{18356}...in Philadelphia|as Mr. George Kaplan of Pittsburgh.
{18358}{18411}On August 11,|you stayed at the Statler in Boston.
{18413}{18510}On August 29, George Kaplan of Boston|registered at the Whittier in Detroit.
{18511}{18567}At present, you are registered|in Room 796...
{18569}{18655}...at the Plaza Hotel in New York|as Mr. George Kaplan of Detroit.
{18659}{18748}In two days, you are due|at the Ambassador East in Chicago.
{18758}{18844}And then at the Sheraton-Johnson Hotel|in Rapid City, South Dakota.
{18846}{18864}Not me!
{18866}{18940}There's no sense in maintaining|that you are deceiving us...
{18942}{18992}...any more than we are deceiving you.
{18994}{19069}I suppose it wouldn't do any good|to show you ID cards...
{19071}{19116}...a driver's license, things like that?
{19118}{19164}They provide you with such good ones.
{19190}{19241}It's getting late. I have guests.
{19255}{19339}Do you intend to cooperate with us?|I'd like a simple yes or no.
{19342}{19371}A simple no.
{19375}{19471}For the simple reason that I simply|don't know what you're talking about.
{19565}{19615}Give Mr. Kaplan a drink, Leonard.
{19620}{19661}A pleasant journey, sir.
{19928}{19970}Scotch? Rye?
{19974}{20015}Bourbon? Vodka?
{20029}{20085}Nothing. I'll take a quick ride|back to town.
{20087}{20127}That has been arranged.
{20129}{20187}But first, a libation.
{20218}{20242}Bourbon!
{20258}{20328}You drink it.|I've had enough stimulation for one day.
{20330}{20436}It'll be easier if you take this yourself.|Otherwise, we'll have to insist.
{20779}{20804}Cheers!
{21973}{22024}Don't worry about me. I'll take the bus.
{26145}{26181}Thanks for the lift.
{26183}{26251}I want this man examined for driving|while intoxicated.
{26252}{26278}Really?
{26284}{26334}You see, they tried to kill me.
{26344}{26379}He won't listen to me.
{26380}{26436}In a big house. They tried to kill me.
{26438}{26513}-All right. Let's just go inside.|-I don't want to go inside.
{26515}{26549}Somebody call the police.
{26551}{26589}Come on. Come on now.
{26608}{26634}Okay.
{26843}{26871}Sit down.
{26895}{26931}I don't want to sit.
{26943}{26985}Perfectly all right. See?
{26994}{27090}We'll get 'em. We'll throw the book|at them. Assault and kidnapping.
{27096}{27156}Assault with a gun and a bourbon|and a sports car.
{27158}{27182}We'll get 'em.
{27183}{27272}You'll be fine after a good night's sleep.|We got a nice cell all made up.
{27275}{27326}I don't want a cell. I want a policeman.
{27328}{27379}The car was just reported stolen.
{27409}{27460}A Mrs. Babson up on Twining Road.
{27478}{27530}I got to call someone. Where's the phone?
{27531}{27571}You're allowed one call.
{27583}{27610}Over here.
{27613}{27638}Thanks.
{27650}{27707}You better make it your lawyer.
{27720}{27772}Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.
{27777}{27826}What am l, a telephone operator?
{27828}{27870}Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.
{28193}{28228}Just a minute, please.
{28230}{28268}-Here.|-Thank you.
{28327}{28357}Hello, Mother?
{28381}{28447}Mother, this is your son, Roger Thornhill.
{28508}{28554}Wait a minute, I'll find out.
{28572}{28602}Where am l?
{28603}{28652}Glen Cove Police Station.
{28667}{28719}Glen Cove Police Station.
{28765}{28824}No, Mother, I have not been drinking.
{28830}{28938}No, these two men, they poured|a whole bottle of bourbon into me.
{28974}{29024}No, they didn't give me a chaser.
{29063}{29103}Come on, let's go.
{29139}{29211}-Wait, I'm not finished yet.|-Yes, you are. Come on.
{29222}{29288}Mother, I got to go now.
{29299}{29363}Get my lawyer right away|and come and bail me out.
{29365}{29411}Tomorrow morning, tell her.
{29418}{29459}Tomorrow morning, he says.
{29491}{29522}I don't know. I'll ask him.
{29523}{29566}She wants to know who says.
{29567}{29612}Sergeant Emil Klinger.
{29620}{29656}Sergeant Emil....
{29670}{29694}Emil?
{29732}{29777}Sergeant Emil Klinger.
{29818}{29866}No. I didn't believe it either.
{29903}{29971}I'm all right, Mother. Good night.
{30091}{30124}That was Mother.
{30142}{30168}Let's go.
{30330}{30370}Here's your man, Doctor.
{30449}{30474}What's your name?
{30480}{30517}Roger Thornhill.
{30523}{30573}Stick out your tongue and say: "ah."
{30575}{30612}You better move back.
{30659}{30696}Have you been drinking?
{30698}{30747}Doctor, I am gassed.
{30762}{30794}What were you drinking?
{30795}{30848}Well, bourbon. See, these two fellas--
{30850}{30914}-How much would you say you drank?|-What?
{30915}{30993}-How much would you say you drank?|-About this much.
{31008}{31097}Mr. Thornhill, my opinion|is that you are definitely intoxicated.
{31099}{31128}No question about it.
{31130}{31182}I won't ask your permission to draw blood.
{31183}{31208}How disgusting!
{31210}{31270}"You may refuse to permit a blood test|to be made...
{31272}{31332}"...but if you do,|your license will be revoked."
{31388}{31467}It was at this point|that Mr. Thornhill succeeded in escaping...
{31468}{31542}...from his would-be assassins,|and when they gave chase...
{31544}{31642}...he, naturally, had to drive|as best he could under the circumstances.
{31672}{31711}How long have you known your client?
{31716}{31750}Seven years, Your Honor.
{31751}{31803}Do you know him to be a reasonable man?
{31809}{31840}Absolutely.
{31887}{31911}Mother!
{31917}{31987}Do you believe there is some credence|to this story?
{31999}{32020}Credence!
{32022}{32096}Yes, Your Honor. If my client says|this is what happened...
{32099}{32143}...I'm certain it must've happened.
{32144}{32166}Damn right.
{32192}{32273}I want this turned over|to the County Detectives for investigation.
{32275}{32329}Call them and have them|come here immediately.
{32331}{32357}Right, Your Honor.
{32359}{32473}Counselor, I'm going to set this over|for final disposition tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.
{32491}{32578}I expect you and the defendant to be here,|ready to go to trial.
{32579}{32679}In the meantime, the County Detectives'll|determine if his story has any basis in fact.
{32701}{32791}"Basis in fact"? lf I were brought in dead,|you still wouldn't believe--
{32792}{32816}Wait a minute.
{32818}{32887}After all, Your Honor,|would I make up such a story?
{32893}{32980}That is precisely what were intending|to find out, Mr. Thornhill.
{33444}{33472}Remember me?
{33475}{33508}-Yes, sir.|-Good.
{33510}{33594}-Is Mr. Townsend at home?|-No, I'm sorry he's left for the day.
{33595}{33625}Mrs. Townsend?
{33643}{33714}-Who shall I say is calling?|-County Detectives.
{33715}{33751}Come in, please.
{33991}{34028}This way, please.
{34278}{34311}This is the room.
{34313}{34342}I'll call Madam.
{34343}{34367}You do that.
{34368}{34418}Here's the sofa where they held me down.
{34419}{34498}They spilled bourbon all over it.|I'll show you the stains.
{34563}{34614}Somebody must've cleaned them off.
{34623}{34681}This is the cabinet|where they keep the liquor.
{34683}{34722}Scotch, gin, vodka....
{34769}{34800}And bourbon.
{34860}{34920}I remember when it used to come|in bottles.
{35022}{35103}Dear, we were so worried about you!
{35123}{35163}Did you get home all right?
{35165}{35191}Of course you did.
{35193}{35277}Let me look at you.|A little pink-eyed, but aren't we all?
{35279}{35343}It was a dull party.|You didn't miss a thing.
{35353}{35446}I want you all to know,|I never saw this woman before last night.
{35449}{35523}Mrs. Townsend, I'm Capt. Junket|of the Nassau County Detectives.
{35525}{35554}This is Lt. Harding.
{35592}{35649}You haven't gotten into trouble, Roger?
{35651}{35711}-Stop calling me Roger.|-Has he gotten into trouble?
{35713}{35819}Mr. Thornhill was picked up last night|driving under the influence of alcohol...
{35820}{35865}...incidentally, in a stolen car...
{35867}{35890}Stolen car!
{35891}{35951}...belonging to Mrs. Babson|of Twining Road.
{35953}{36011}Roger, you said you were going|to call a cab.
{36012}{36070}You didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes?
{36075}{36131}No, I didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes!
{36135}{36240}Mr. Thornhill has told us that he was|brought here against his will last night...
{36242}{36358}...and forcibly intoxicated by some friends|of your husband and set out on the road.
{36359}{36408}Do you know anything about this?
{36423}{36503}Roger was a bit tipsy|when he arrived here by cab for dinner.
{36505}{36527}She's lying.
{36528}{36610}And I'm afraid he became even worse|as the evening wore on.
{36611}{36689}Finally, he told us he had to go home|to sleep it off.
{36692}{36751}I knew I should've served dinner earlier.
{36753}{36788}What a performance!
{36795}{36879}Mrs. Townsend, does the name|George Kaplan mean anything to you?
{36883}{36912}George Kaplan?
{36937}{36975}-No.|-I didn't think so.
{36997}{37066}Where's her husband?|He's the one you should be questioning.
{37067}{37110}Is there any place he can be reached?
{37111}{37155}Yes. The United Nations.
{37206}{37275}He's addressing the General Assembly|this afternoon.
{37325}{37386}All right. So he's addressing|the General Assembly.
{37387}{37455}-Sorry we had to bother you.|-No bother at all.
{37531}{37572}Now, wait a minute.
{37712}{37779}Do you want to get in touch|with my husband, Captain?
{37780}{37836}No, Mrs. Townsend,|that won't be necessary.
{37838}{37911}Do you mean you're not going|to do any more about this?
{37935}{37979}Pay the two dollars.
{38358}{38381}Goodbye.
{39033}{39123}-I don't see why you want me along.|-You lend a certain air of respectability.
{39125}{39167}Don't be sarcastic, Roger.
{39440}{39500}There you are, dear. Park yourself there.
{39510}{39543}Well, here it goes.
{39569}{39595}Hello, Operator.
{39597}{39659}Have you got a George Kaplan|staying here?
{39695}{39725}That's right.
{39742}{39766}You have?
{39769}{39800}Room 796.
{39826}{39867}Ring it, will you please?
{39875}{39918}-You see?|-I see.
{39920}{40011}I hope he clears up this silly business.|You're ruining my whole day.
{40063}{40116}Did he leave word when he'd be back?
{40144}{40171}Really?
{40179}{40206}Thank you.
{40232}{40306}That's odd. He hasn't answered|his telephone in two days.
{40308}{40355}Maybe he got locked in the bathroom.
{40356}{40404}Mother, do me a favor, will you?
{40407}{40514}Put on that innocent look you do so well|and go to the desk and get the key to 796.
{40516}{40559}I wouldn't do such a thing!
{40561}{40616}-$10?|-Not for all the money in the world.
{40619}{40677}-$50?|-Roger, you are disgraceful.
{40791}{40890}Car theft, drunk driving,|assaulting an officer, lying to a judge...
{40900}{40937}...and now, house-breaking.
{40939}{41018}-No, hotel-breaking. There's a difference.|-Of five to ten years.
{41019}{41052}Just a minute, please.
{41115}{41178}Will you be wanting me|to change your bedding, sir?
{41179}{41227}Yes. Well, but not right now.
{41229}{41308}I mention it, because the bed|doesn't seem like it's been slept in...
{41310}{41383}...and I was wondering|if I ought to change the linens.
{41386}{41430}Thank you for your interest.
{41467}{41491}Come on.
{41579}{41630}She seemed to think I'm Kaplan.
{41651}{41698}I wonder if I look like Kaplan.
{41960}{42007}-Look who's here.|-Who? Where?
{42015}{42100}Our friend who's assembling|the General Assembly this afternoon.
{42111}{42155}Roger, I think we should go.
{42163}{42188}Don't be nervous.
{42190}{42287}-I'm not. I'll be late for the bridge club.|-Good. You'll lose less than usual.
{42648}{42713}Bulletin, Kaplan has dandruff.
{42715}{42762}In that case, I think we should leave.
{42763}{42791}Too late.
{42923}{42995}-You rang for me, sir?|-Yes. Come in for a moment.
{43020}{43074}-What's your name?|-Elsie, sir.
{43136}{43200}-Do you know who I am?|-You're Mr. Kaplan.
{43220}{43280}When did you first see me?
{43289}{43315}Outside the door.
{43331}{43406}Out in the hall a couple of minutes ago.|Don't you remember?
{43407}{43460}Is that the first time you laid eyes on me?
{43462}{43520}Can I help it if you're never around,|Mr. Kaplan?
{43522}{43570}Then how do you know I'm Mr. Kaplan?
{43572}{43624}-What?|-How do you know I'm Mr. Kaplan?
{43626}{43660}Of course you are.
{43662}{43704}This is Room 796, isn't it?
{43711}{43779}So, you're the gentleman in Room 796,|aren't you?
{43805}{43839}All right, Elsie, thanks.
{43841}{43908}-Will that be all, sir?|-For the time being, yes.
{44050}{44074}Valet.
{44077}{44106}Yes, come in.
{44135}{44210}-Should I hang it in the closet, Mr. Kaplan?|-Yes, please.
{44361}{44388}Tell me....
{44395}{44452}What time did I give you that suit?
{44479}{44527}Last night. Around 6:00.
{44552}{44615}-Did I give it to you personally?|-Personally?
{44617}{44702}No. You called down on the phone|and described the suit to me.
{44704}{44783}Said it would be hanging in your closet.|Like you always do.
{44792}{44850}-Anything wrong?|-No, I'm just curious.
{44861}{44903}-Here. Thanks.|-Thank you.
{44913}{44959}Nice to meet you, Mr. Kaplan.
{45065}{45109}Isn't that the damnedest thing?
{45111}{45195}I'm beginning to think that no one|in the hotel has actually seen Kaplan.
{45197}{45269}Maybe he has his suits mended|by invisible weavers.
{45417}{45454}Let me see something.
{45608}{45667}I don't think that one does|anything for you.
{45794}{45828}Now, that's much better.
{45848}{45927}Obviously they've mistaken me|for a much shorter man.
{46031}{46077}-Should l?|-Certainly not.
{46122}{46154}Hold that.
{46268}{46328}It's good to find you in, Mr. Kaplan.
{46337}{46366}Who is this?
{46367}{46444}We met only last night and still|you do not recognize my voice.
{46446}{46492}I should feel offended.
{46498}{46575}Yes, I know who you are|and I'm not Mr. Kaplan.
{46583}{46670}Of course not. You answer his telephone,|you live in his hotel room...
{46672}{46724}...and yet you are not Mr. Kaplan.
{46726}{46791}Nevertheless,|we are pleased to find you in.
{46815}{46844}Now wait....
{46880}{46911}Operator?
{46929}{47007}Operator, this is Mr. Thorn....|Kaplan in 796.
{47015}{47102}Where did that call come from?|From the outside or from the lobby?
{47103}{47163}-Just a minute. I'll see.|-Hurry, please.
{47164}{47188}Who was it?
{47191}{47247}One of the men|who tried to kill me last night.
{47248}{47288}We're back to that one, are we?
{47340}{47421}-That call was made from the lobby, sir.|-It was?
{47438}{47490}They're probably on their way up here.
{47492}{47577}-Let's get out of here.|-I think I'd like to meet these killers.
{48633}{48711}You gentlemen aren't really trying|to kill my son, are you?
{49268}{49317}Lobby, please. Watch your step.
{49339}{49420}Gentlemen, please. Ladies first.|Come along, ladies.
{49422}{49469}That's right. Come along. Good.
{49505}{49552}Roger, will you be home for dinner?
{49647}{49709}-Where to?|-I don't know. Just keep going.
{50091}{50154}-Take me to the United Nations.|-Right.
{50156}{50197}General Assembly Building.
{50199}{50223}Right.
{50225}{50295}-I'm being followed. Can you do anything?|-Yes, I can.
{50296}{50309}Do it.
{51107}{51146}-May I help you?|-Yes, please.
{51148}{51199}Where will I find Mr. Lester Townsend?
{51201}{51255}Mr. Lester Townsend of UNIPO?
{51264}{51319}Did you have an appointment, sir?
{51332}{51378}Well, yes. He expects me.
{51379}{51417}Your name, please?
{51419}{51458}-My name?|-Yes, please.
{51475}{51513}Kaplan. George Kaplan.
{51570}{51610}One moment, please.
{51753}{51803}Wait for me at the corner of 47th.
{51979}{52078}If you'd give this to one of the attendants|in the public lounge, she'll page him.
{52080}{52148}-Thank you very much.|-You're welcome, Mr. Kaplan.
{52687}{52738}Page Mr. Lester Townsend, please?
{52740}{52785}Certainly, Mr. Kaplan.
{52791}{52830}Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.
{52832}{52877}Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.
{52880}{52968}Please call at the communications desk|of the Public Lounge.
{53183}{53212}You paged me?
{53218}{53251}-Mr. Kaplan?|-Yes.
{53252}{53329}You wanted to see Mr. Townsend.|This is Mr. Townsend.
{53331}{53375}How do you do, Mr. Kaplan?
{53386}{53429}This isn't Mr. Townsend.
{53432}{53463}Yes, it is.
{53487}{53548}There must be some mistake.|Mr. Lester Townsend?
{53550}{53610}That's me. What can I do for you?
{53703}{53755}Are you the Townsend|who lives in Glen Cove?
{53757}{53811}That's right. Are we neighbors?
{53834}{53906}A large, red-brick house|with a curved, tree-lined driveway?
{53907}{53943}That's the one.
{53967}{54012}Were you at home last night?
{54014}{54057}-You mean in Glen Cove?|-Yes.
{54059}{54127}I've been staying in my apartment|in town for the last month.
{54128}{54185}I always do when we're in session here.
{54187}{54221}What about Mrs. Townsend?
{54233}{54292}My wife has been dead for many years.
{54295}{54346}Mr. Kaplan, what's this all about?
{54358}{54411}Who are those people living in your house?
{54413}{54472}What people?|The house is completely closed up.
{54483}{54554}There's just a gardener and his wife|living on the grounds.
{54555}{54619}Now, Mr. Kaplan, tell me who you are|and what you want.
{54743}{54782}Do you know this man?
{54981}{55005}Look!
{55118}{55154}He's got a knife! Look out!
{55156}{55217}Listen to me.|I had nothing to do with this.
{55224}{55282}-Call the police.|-Don't come any nearer!
{55286}{55310}Get back!
{55693}{55766}UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
{55776}{55856}"The photograph has been identified|as that of Roger Thornhill...
{55859}{55972}"...a Manhattan advertising executive,|indicating that the name George Kaplan...
{55975}{56054}"...which he gave to an attendant|in the General Assembly Building...
{56056}{56085}"...was false.
{56104}{56191}"A possible motive for the slaying|was suggested by the discovery...
{56198}{56291}"...that earlier today, Thornhill appeared|in a Glen Cove police court...
{56291}{56366}"...charged with drunk driving|with a stolen car...
{56392}{56476}"...and in his defense he charged|that the murder victim, Mr. Townsend...
{56478}{56540}"...had tried to kill him the night before."
{56544}{56567}Brother!
{56574}{56608}What about that?
{56628}{56684}Does anyone know this Thornhill?
{56697}{56723}No, not me.
{56725}{56755}Never heard of him.
{56767}{56793}Professor?
{56797}{56883}Apparently, the poor sucker got mistaken|for George Kaplan.
{56893}{56974}How could he be mistaken for|George Kaplan when he doesn't even exist?
{56976}{57055}Don't ask me how it happened,|but obviously it happened.
{57056}{57148}Vandamm's men must have grabbed him|and tried to put him away...
{57152}{57198}...using Lester Townsend's house.
{57200}{57280}And the unsuspecting Townsend winds up|with a stray knife in his back.
{57308}{57345}C'est la guerre.
{57352}{57415}It's so horribly sad.|Why is it I feel like laughing?
{57417}{57458}What are we going to do?
{57460}{57481}Do?
{57488}{57531}About Mr. Thornhill?
{57547}{57607}We...do nothing!
{57634}{57651}Nothing?
{57660}{57698}That's right. Nothing.
{57713}{57811}We could congratulate ourselves|on a marvelous stroke of good fortune.
{57840}{57939}Our non-existent decoy, George Kaplan,|created to divert suspicion...
{57940}{58035}...from our actual agent,|has fortuitously become a live decoy.
{58037}{58072}Yes, Professor.
{58074}{58131}How long do you think he'll stay alive?
{58154}{58193}That's his problem.
{58196}{58236}What Mrs. Finley means--
{58241}{58272}I know what she means.
{58274}{58351}We can't sit back calmly and wait to see|who kills him first!
{58352}{58400}Vandamm and company or the police?
{58432}{58515}What can we do to save him|without endangering our own agent?
{58523}{58583}Aren't we being just a wee bit callous?
{58589}{58651}No, my dear woman,|we're not being callous.
{58661}{58761}We didn't invent our non-existent man|and give him the name of George Kaplan...
{58763}{58835}...establish elaborate behavior patterns|for him...
{58837}{58947}...move his prop belongings in and out|of hotel rooms, for our private amusement.
{58968}{59011}We created George Kaplan...
{59014}{59074}...and labored successfully|to convince Vandamm...
{59076}{59171}...that this was our agent hot on his trail|for a desperately important reason.
{59189}{59227}Nobody's denying that!
{59232}{59260}Very well, then.
{59262}{59370}If we make the slightest move to suggest|there's no such agent as George Kaplan...
{59372}{59479}...give any hint to Vandamm he's pursuing|a decoy instead of our own agent...
{59480}{59561}...then our agent, working right under|Vandamm's very nose...
{59575}{59639}...will immediately face suspicion,|exposure...
{59655}{59694}...and assassination.
{59725}{59770}Like the two others who went before.
{59777}{59852}Goodbye, Mr. Thornhill, wherever you are.
{60058}{60113}Train number 25...
{60127}{60202}...the 20th Century Limited...
{60223}{60327}...due to leave in 6:00 p.m. for Chicago....
{60448}{60484}Yes, dear. I know.
{60495}{60570}Now, listen to me, Mother,|I called the Plaza.
{60580}{60658}Kaplan checked out and went|to the Ambassador East in Chicago.
{60660}{60694}That's why I'm--
{60712}{60775}I can't go to the police. At least not yet.
{60778}{60845}You saw the newspapers.|My fingerprints are on the knife.
{60847}{60921}I'm a car thief, a drunk driver,|and a murderer.
{60925}{60961}I wouldn't have a chance.
{60963}{61075}I won't have, until I find George Kaplan|who obviously knows what this is about.
{61079}{61127}No, the train. It's safer.
{61143}{61238}Because there's no place to hide on a plane|if anyone should recognize me.
{61258}{61316}You want me to jump off a moving plane?
{61347}{61411}Well, thank you so much, Mother.|Goodbye.
{61744}{61787}MANHUNT ON FOR U. N. KILLER
{62348}{62409}Give me a bedroom|on the 20th Century, please.
{62411}{62448}It's leaving in five minutes.
{62450}{62492}I know. Will you make it snappy?
{62494}{62540}I think they're all sold out.
{62544}{62566}Sold out?
{62568}{62608}You can always go coach.
{62612}{62676}No, I can't do that.|What time is the next train?
{62678}{62749}Nothing till 10:00. You're in a hurry, huh?
{62766}{62827}Could you call them|and see what they have?
{62828}{62868}Something wrong with your eyes?
{62870}{62945}Yes, they're sensitive to questions.|Will you call them?
{62949}{62981}Sure. Sure.
{63057}{63081}Don't go away!
{63309}{63374}He's at Window 15, upper level. Hurry.
{63421}{63463}You're in luck, mister.
{63639}{63699}-Ticket?|-I'm just seeing some friends off.
{63742}{63779}I have to know their names.
{63805}{63833}Come here!
{64615}{64635}I'm sorry.
{64636}{64679}-I'm sorry.|-My fault.
{64704}{64728}Sorry.
{64958}{65008}He went that way. I think he got off.
{65026}{65062}All aboard!
{65153}{65208}-Thank you.|-Quite all right.
{65209}{65254}Seven parking tickets.
{67167}{67220}-Good evening, sir. One?|-Please.
{67559}{67593}A cocktail before dinner?
{67595}{67648}-Yes, please. A Gibson.|-Right away.
{67887}{67915}Here we are again.
{67935}{67957}Yes.
{68005}{68037}You recommend anything?
{68039}{68127}The brook trout.|A little "trouty" but quite good.
{68148}{68171}Sold.
{68224}{68255}"Brook...
{68261}{68286}"...trout."
{68300}{68341}-There you are.|-Yes, sir.
{68636}{68681}I know. I look vaguely familiar.
{68683}{68705}Yes.
{68716}{68773}You feel you've seen me|somewhere before.
{68818}{68886}I have that effect on people.|It's something about my face.
{68918}{68956}It's a nice face.
{68979}{69050}-You think so?|-I wouldn't say it if I didn't.
{69071}{69114}Oh, you're that type.
{69116}{69142}What type?
{69151}{69176}Honest.
{69192}{69216}Not really.
{69234}{69291}Good. Because honest women|frighten me.
{69293}{69316}Why?
{69333}{69396}Somehow they seem to put me|at a disadvantage.
{69403}{69477}-Because you're not honest with them?|-Exactly.
{69483}{69559}Like that business about|the seven parking tickets?
{69561}{69639}What I mean is,|the moment I meet an attractive woman...
{69672}{69757}...l have to start pretending I've no desire|to make love to her.
{69765}{69817}What makes you think|you have to conceal it?
{69833}{69880}She might find the idea objectionable.
{69897}{69942}Then again, she might not.
{70022}{70080}Think how lucky I am|to have been seated here.
{70082}{70132}Luck had nothing to do with it.
{70146}{70162}Fate?
{70217}{70303}I tipped the steward $5 to seat you here|if you should come in.
{70411}{70442}Is that a proposition?
{70483}{70537}I never discuss love on an empty stomach.
{70560}{70590}You've already eaten.
{70608}{70634}But you haven't.
{70818}{70871}Don't you think it's time|we were introduced?
{70882}{70959}I'm Eve Kendall. I'm 26 and unmarried.
{70988}{71029}Now you know everything.
{71047}{71135}What do you do besides lure men|to their doom on the 20th Century Limited?
{71141}{71184}I'm an industrial designer.
{71230}{71257}Jack Phillips.
{71259}{71328}Western sales manager|for Kingby Electronics.
{71332}{71389}No, you're not. You're Roger Thornhill...
{71399}{71432}...of Madison Avenue...
{71433}{71507}...and you're wanted for murder|on every front page in America.
{71517}{71558}Don't be so modest.
{71632}{71654}Don't worry.
{71667}{71717}-I won't say a word.|-How come?
{71749}{71782}I told you.
{71796}{71821}It's a nice face.
{71834}{71868}Is that the only reason?
{71881}{71919}It's going to be a long night.
{71958}{71980}True.
{71987}{72046}I don't particularly like the book|I've started.
{72092}{72121}You know what I mean?
{72157}{72191}Let me think.
{72288}{72327}I know exactly what you mean.
{72564}{72599}R.O.T.
{72635}{72675}That's my trademark. R.O.T.
{72696}{72753}Roger O. Thornhill.|What does the "O" stand for?
{72780}{72807}Nothing.
{73367}{73435}I'd invite you to my bedroom|if I had a bedroom.
{73449}{73470}A roomette?
{73472}{73508}Nothing, not even a ticket.
{73512}{73601}I've been playing hide-and-seek|ever since the train left New York.
{73626}{73656}How awkward for you.
{73660}{73684}Yes, isn't it?
{73688}{73715}No place to sleep.
{73752}{73804}I have a large drawing-room all to myself.
{73824}{73863}That doesn't seem quite fair.
{73892}{73924}Drawing-room E.
{73944}{73986}Car 3901 .
{74009}{74042}Such a nice number.
{74080}{74124}It's easy to remember.
{74127}{74162}3901 .
{74194}{74214}See?
{74252}{74275}No luggage.
{74363}{74383}So?
{74388}{74463}You wouldn't happen to have|an extra pair of pajamas, would you?
{74469}{74496}Wouldn't l?
{74546}{74600}I wouldn't order any dessert if I were you.
{74625}{74653}I get the message.
{74675}{74715}That isn't exactly what I meant.
{74732}{74792}The train seems to be making|an unscheduled stop.
{74794}{74879}I saw two men get out of a police car|as we pulled into the station.
{74896}{74926}They weren't smiling.
{75462}{75528}You better go out|and tell those police to hurry.
{75530}{75568}Patience is a virtue.
{75571}{75607}So is breathing.
{75610}{75646}Just lie still.
{75686}{75729}Have you got any olive oil?
{75731}{75760}Olive oil?
{75765}{75837}I want to be packed in olive oil|if I'm going to be a sardine.
{75879}{75898}Come in.
{75942}{75995}-Who are you?|-State Police.
{76024}{76060}Your name please?
{76061}{76119}Eve Kendall. Is anything wrong?
{76123}{76185}There was a man at your table tonight|in the dining car.
{76204}{76227}Yes.
{76231}{76267}Friend of yours?
{76280}{76313}I never saw him before.
{76346}{76379}Is this the man?
{76415}{76486}Yes, I think so.|It's not a very clear picture.
{76496}{76569}It's a wire-photo.|We just got it from the New York police.
{76571}{76592}Police?
{76594}{76626}He's wanted for murder.
{76657}{76696}Good heavens, no!
{76708}{76767}The steward said|you left the dining car together.
{76782}{76868}We might have happened to leave|at the same time but not together.
{76888}{76924}What did you two talk about?
{76949}{76972}Talk about?
{76973}{77047}The waiter said you were getting along fine|with this Thornhill.
{77050}{77089}Is that his name? Thornhill?
{77122}{77154}He didn't tell you?
{77180}{77231}He didn't tell me anything.
{77236}{77315}All we did was chat about|different kinds of food...
{77316}{77391}...train travel versus plane travel,|that sort of thing.
{77404}{77499}Rather innocuous, I must say,|considering he was a fugitive from justice.
{77512}{77538}Who did he kill?
{77541}{77584}He didn't say where he was going?
{77608}{77632}No.
{77635}{77674}I assumed Chicago.
{77684}{77733}Perhaps he got off when you got on?
{77764}{77816}If you happen to see him again, Miss...
{77826}{77850}Kendall.
{77854}{77895}...will you let us know?
{77910}{78019}I'm going to bed and I'll lock my door.|I doubt if I'll see anybody else tonight.
{78024}{78108}In case you do, we'll be in|the observation car at the rear of the train.
{78131}{78168}It's comforting to know that.
{78205}{78231}Good night.
{78280}{78314}Still breathing?
{78316}{78371}Either hurry up or get me a snorkel.
{78396}{78479}I'm looking for the can opener|I stole from the porter.
{78605}{78639}Hello, there.
{78646}{78671}Hello.
{78971}{79024}Tell me, why are you so good to me?
{79056}{79104}Shall I climb up and tell you why?
{79444}{79479}I've been thinking...
{79495}{79591}...it's not safe for you to roam Chicago|looking for this George Kaplan...
{79593}{79642}...you've been telling me about.
{79653}{79739}You'll be picked up by the police|the moment you show your face.
{79750}{79790}It's such a nice face, too.
{79857}{79974}Don't you think it'd be a better idea|if you stayed in my hotel room...
{79986}{80072}...while I located him for you|and brought him to you?
{80092}{80156}I can't let you get involved.|It's too dangerous.
{80183}{80216}I'm a big girl.
{80249}{80309}Yeah, and in all the right places, too.
{80432}{80501}You know, this is ridiculous.|You know that, don't you?
{80503}{80525}Yes.
{80533}{80582}I mean, we've hardly met.
{80587}{80616}That's right.
{80634}{80687}How do I know you aren't a murderer?
{80700}{80730}You don't.
{80744}{80828}Maybe you're planning to murder me,|right here, tonight.
{80850}{80877}Shall l?
{80908}{80938}Please do.
{81438}{81479}Beats flying, doesn't it?
{81538}{81574}We should stop.
{81582}{81614}Immediately.
{81628}{81676}I ought to know more about you.
{81694}{81732}What more could you know?
{81801}{81855}You're an advertising man,|that's all I know.
{81869}{81899}That's right.
{81961}{82015}The train's a little unsteady.
{82016}{82046}Who isn't?
{82068}{82112}What else do you know?
{82145}{82223}You've got taste in clothes, taste in food....
{82292}{82361}And taste in women. I like your flavor.
{82565}{82616}You're very clever with words.
{82624}{82688}You can probably make them|do anything for you.
{82716}{82770}Sell people things they don't need...
{82774}{82847}...make women who don't know you|fall in love with you.
{82907}{82971}I'm beginning to think I'm underpaid.
{83299}{83328}Look out.
{83607}{83674}-Don't bother with the washroom.|-Yes, ma'am.
{83676}{83746}By the way, I found this on the floor.|Does it belong to you?
{83748}{83799}Yes, ma'am. I've been looking for it.
{83800}{83852}-I'll wait outside.|-Thank you.
{84261}{84287}Thank you, Porter.
{84296}{84340}Thank you, ma'am. Good night now.
{84342}{84372}Good night.
{84477}{84532}Come out, come out, wherever you are.
{84653}{84680}The porter.
{84734}{84764}So I see.
{84967}{85001}Where were we?
{85004}{85031}Here.
{85162}{85210}Nice of him to have opened the bed.
{85261}{85292}Only one bed.
{85349}{85405}That's a good omen, don't you think?
{85407}{85436}Wonderful.
{85471}{85515}Do you know what that means?
{85535}{85566}What? Tell me.
{85592}{85658}It means you'll sleep on the floor.
{86180}{86228}A message from the lady in 3901 .
{86355}{86451}What do I do with him|in the morning? Eve.
{87285}{87345}-You keep walking. I'll catch up.|-Yes, ma'am.
{87384}{87416}Anything to report?
{87440}{87485}Yes. I had a fine night's sleep.
{87504}{87562}I mean, have you seen the man|we're looking for?
{87579}{87607}Mr. Thornycroft?
{87630}{87652}Thornhill.
{87693}{87740}No, no. I'm awfully sorry.
{87753}{87796}But good luck to you both.
{87906}{87984}-How are we doing?|-I may collapse at any moment.
{87995}{88063}Not yet. First we have to run the gauntlet.|Look.
{88204}{88298}I'm accustomed to having a load on,|but what have you got in these bags?
{88300}{88361}-Bowling balls, naturally.|-Oh, naturally.
{88369}{88418}Which one of these has my suit in it?
{88420}{88477}The small one underneath your right arm.
{88479}{88537}Thanks. That ought to do the suit|a lot of good.
{88540}{88596}I'm sure Mr. Kaplan won't mind|a few wrinkles.
{88601}{88663}Yeah, if he's still there. What time is it?
{88673}{88699}9:10.
{88701}{88773}9:10! He may have left|his hotel room by now.
{88775}{88843}I'll call him for you as soon|as we get inside the station.
{88844}{88879}Thank you. I can do it.
{88880}{88952}A redcap in a phone booth?|Slightly suspicious.
{88986}{89052}All right. Do you know|what you'll tell him?
{89060}{89147}You want to see him right away.|Terribly urgent. Matter of life and death.
{89149}{89191}-No explanations.|-Right.
{89204}{89263}While I'm calling,|you can change your clothes.
{89265}{89348}Where do you propose I do that?|In Marshall Field's window?
{89350}{89405}I sort of had the men's room in mind.
{89412}{89443}Did you, now?
{89467}{89551}You're the smartest girl|I ever spent the night with on a train.
{89831}{89866}I think we made it.
{89959}{89987}Where did he go?
{89989}{90042}-Which way did he go?|-Where did he go?
{90044}{90117}I don't know. He took my clothes.|He went up that way.
{93371}{93402}What took you so long?
{93404}{93484}I have a big face. Small razor.|Tell me, did you get Kaplan?
{93486}{93508}Yes.
{93513}{93547}Fine. What did he say?
{93548}{93622}He'll see you but not at the hotel|under any circumstances.
{93624}{93680}-He'll see you on the outside.|-Where? When?
{93682}{93742}-I've got it all written down for you.|-Thanks.
{93744}{93803}Take the Greyhound Bus|that leaves Chicago...
{93804}{93924}...for Indianapolis at 2:00 and ask the driver|to let you off at Prairie Stop, Highway 41 .
{93950}{93998}Prairie Stop, Highway 41 . Good.
{94000}{94059}It's about an hour-and-a-half's drive|from Chicago.
{94060}{94092}Fine. I'll rent a car.
{94094}{94192}No car. Mr. Kaplan said bus.|He wants to be sure you're alone.
{94204}{94267}All right. What'll I do when I get there?
{94269}{94328}Just wait beside the road.|He'll be there at 3:30.
{94330}{94379}-How will I know him?|-He'll know you.
{94381}{94431}You made the Chicago papers, too.
{94476}{94527}Have you set your watch for Central time?
{94531}{94575}Yes, I did that. Thanks.
{94596}{94632}What's the matter?
{94633}{94652}Matter?
{94664}{94722}Yes, you seem.... I don't know.|You seem tense.
{94724}{94784}You better go before the police|run out of red caps.
{94797}{94844}We'll see each other again, won't we?
{94864}{94905}Sometime, I'm sure.
{94932}{94992}I never had a moment|to thank you properly.
{94993}{95049}-Please go.|-But where will I find you?
{95073}{95114}I've got to pick up my bags now.
{95128}{95198}Yes. These are the checks|for the large cases.
{95200}{95230}Wait a minute.
{95247}{95272}Please.
{95316}{95340}They're coming.
{101758}{101803}-Hot day.|-I've seen worse.
{101881}{101936}Are you supposed|to be meeting someone here?
{101938}{102003}I'm waiting for the bus.|It's due any minute.
{102040}{102121}Some of them crop-duster pilots get rich|if they live long enough.
{102228}{102275}Then your name isn't Kaplan?
{102292}{102341}Can't say it is, 'cause it ain't.
{102364}{102414}Here she comes. Right on time.
{102505}{102543}-That's funny.|-What?
{102559}{102622}That plane's dusting crops|where there ain't no crops.
{108225}{108285}Get out of here! The other tank may blow!
{108556}{108588}What happened?
{109221}{109247}Come back!
{109266}{109311}Come back! Come back!
{110560}{110639}Could you let me have|Mr. George Kaplan's room number, please?
{110641}{110669}Kaplan?
{110676}{110719}I think he checked out.
{110748}{110773}Checked out?
{110775}{110843}That's right.|He checked out at 7:10 this morning.
{110845}{110881}7:10? Are you sure?
{110886}{110935}Yes. He left a forwarding address.
{110936}{111009}Hotel Sheraton-Johnson,|Rapid City, South Dakota.
{111014}{111040}7:10?
{111062}{111124}Then how come I got a message|from him at 9:00....
{111126}{111153}What's that?
{111238}{111267}Nothing.
{111940}{111989}Sorry to bother you again.
{111993}{112067}Miss Eve Kendall is expecting me.|She's in room four-something.
{112068}{112128}I've forgotten the number.|Would you mind?
{112355}{112415}-She's in 463.|-Yes, that's right. Thanks.
{113052}{113077}Hello.
{113233}{113257}Surprised?
{113284}{113307}Yes.
{113336}{113380}No getting rid of me, is there?
{113666}{113708}I could use a drink.
{113751}{113784}I have some scotch.
{113785}{113827}With water. No ice.
{113944}{114031}Two Die As Crop-Duster Plane Crashes|Craft Hits Oil Tanker, Drivers Escape
{114040}{114083}How did it go today?
{114162}{114209}The meeting with Kaplan?
{114259}{114299}He didn't show up.
{114360}{114397}It's funny, isn't it?
{114420}{114440}Why funny?
{114456}{114559}After all those explicit directions|he gave you on the phone.
{114597}{114639}Maybe I copied them down wrong.
{114653}{114748}I don't think you got them wrong.|I think you sent me to the right place.
{114821}{114894}Why don't you call him back again|and see what happened?
{114896}{114969}I did. He checked out.|Went to South Dakota.
{114997}{115027}South Dakota?
{115041}{115072}Rapid City.
{115120}{115160}What are you going to do next?
{115184}{115222}I haven't made my mind up yet.
{115232}{115275}It may depend on you.
{115314}{115339}On me?
{115347}{115373}Sure.
{115401}{115454}You're my little helper, aren't you?
{115461}{115487}Thank you.
{115489}{115571}To us. To a long and lasting friendship.
{115587}{115693}Meaning, from now on, I'm not going|to let you out of my sight, sweetheart.
{115704}{115771}-I'm afraid you'll have to.|-Oh, no.
{115778}{115875}I do have plans of my own, you know.|And you do have problems.
{115893}{116005}Wouldn't it be nice if my problems|and your plans were somehow connected?
{116015}{116074}Then we could always stay close|to each other...
{116076}{116181}...and not have to go in separate directions.|Togetherness. You know what I mean?
{116280}{116325}Go ahead, it can't be for me.
{116606}{116649}No, not yet. I'm not ready.
{116673}{116700}What time?
{116716}{116771}I'll meet you. What's the address?
{116854}{116888}Yes. Goodbye.
{116968}{116996}Business?
{117008}{117025}Yes.
{117027}{117082}Industrial designing business?
{117168}{117211}All work and no play.
{117226}{117340}You should be enjoying yourself tonight|instead of taking phone calls from clients.
{117388}{117443}What about having dinner with me?
{117447}{117501}You can't afford to be seen anyplace.
{117503}{117562}Let's have it up here. Nice and cozy.
{117564}{117591}No, l....
{117624}{117647}I can't.
{117687}{117715}I insist.
{117764}{117822}I want you to do a favor for me.
{117835}{117885}-A big, big favor.|-Name it.
{117916}{117959}I want you to leave right now.
{117978}{118039}Stay far away from me|and don't come near me again.
{118124}{118164}We're not going to get involved.
{118180}{118242}Last night was last night|and that's all there was.
{118259}{118336}That's all there is. There won't be|anything more between us.
{118352}{118382}So, please....
{118399}{118422}Goodbye.
{118435}{118497}Good luck. No conversation. Just leave.
{118511}{118534}Right away?
{118549}{118569}Yes.
{118586}{118619}No questions asked?
{118633}{118653}Yes.
{118695}{118723}I can't do that.
{118728}{118752}Please.
{118765}{118788}After dinner.
{118792}{118815}Now.
{118822}{118858}After dinner. Fair is fair.
{118923}{118950}All right.
{118968}{119001}On one condition.
{119030}{119120}That you let the hotel valet|do something with this suit first.
{119122}{119180}You belong in the stockyards|looking like that.
{119182}{119205}Okay.
{119248}{119283}There's the phone.
{119416}{119457}Valet service, please.
{119643}{119693}-Where are we?|-463.
{119708}{119740}Room 463.
{119756}{119818}How quickly can you get a suit|sponged and pressed?
{119820}{119846}Yes, fast.
{119864}{119911}20 minutes? Fine.
{119920}{119953}Okay. 463.
{120035}{120070}He'll be right up.
{120073}{120126}Better take your things off.
{120197}{120278}Now, what could a man do|with his clothes off for 20 minutes?
{120280}{120319}Couldn't he have taken an hour?
{120321}{120374}You could always take a cold shower.
{120376}{120405}That's right.
{120435}{120520}When I was a little boy,|I wouldn't even let my mother undress me.
{120522}{120554}You're a big boy now.
{120665}{120757}Tell me, how does a girl like you|get to be a girl like you?

{120913}{120939}Ever kill anyone?
{120978}{121060}Because I bet you could tease a man|to death without half trying.

{121523}{121552}Trousers, please.

{125387}{125451}-I haven't had the pleasure.|-You disappoint me, sir.
{125473}{125520}I was just going to say that to her.
{125521}{125593}I've always understood you were|a shrewd fellow at your job.
{125595}{125664}What possessed you to come|blundering in here like this?
{125665}{125717}Could it be an overpowering|interest in art?
{125729}{125771}Yes. The art of survival.
{125822}{125847}Have you poured any good drunks lately?
{125904}{125948}He followed me here from the hotel.
{125973}{126009}He was in your room?

{127101}{127150}Oh, Mr. Vandamm.
{127181}{127301}Has anyone told you that you overplay|your various roles rather severely?
{127311}{127371}First, you're the outraged|Madison Avenue man...
{127372}{127432}...who claims he's been mistaken|for someone else.
{127433}{127472}Then, you play the fugitive...
{127474}{127539}...trying to clear his name of a crime|he didn't commit.
{127561}{127619}Now you play the peevish lover...
{127621}{127667}...stung by jealousy and betrayal.
{127694}{127766}It seems you fellows could stand|less training from the FBI...
{127768}{127814}...and more from the Actors' Studio.
{127842}{127931}Apparently, the only performance|that will satisfy you is when I play dead.
{127942}{128024}Your very next role.|You'll be quite convincing, I assure you.
{128054}{128101}Thank you. $375 is bid.

{128324}{128386}Am I to be dropped|into a vat of molten steel...
{128388}{128444}...and become part of a new skyscraper?
{128456}{128558}Or are you going to ask this female|to kiss me again and poison me to death?
{128633}{128714}Who are you kidding?|You have no feelings to hurt.
{128916}{128963}We've had just about enough of you.
{128965}{129015}Then, why don't you send for the police?
{129064}{129148}That's the last thing you'd want, isn't it?|Me in the hands of the police.
{129150}{129195}There's something I might tell them.
{129196}{129263}That's why you had her hustle me|on the train last night.
{129271}{129362}Something tells me I've got a better|chance of survival if I go to the police.
{129400}{129468}Good night, sweetheart.|Don't think it wasn't nice.
{129487}{129570}$1,200 there. $1,200 is bid. Say $1,300?

{131986}{132083}One thing we know. You're no fake.|You're a genuine idiot.
{132095}{132116}Thank you.
{132136}{132171}I wonder if I could...
{132173}{132251}...ask the gentleman to get into the spirit|of the proceedings.
{132252}{132295}All right. I'll start it at $800.

{136000}{136066}You're about to become heroes.|Don't you know who I am?
{136099}{136189}We'll find out as soon as we book you|for being drunk and disorderly.
{136198}{136274}That's chicken feed. You've hit the jackpot.

{136853}{136887}Code 76.

{137398}{137427}Are you sure?
{137460}{137496}Okay. Right.
{137508}{137539}Yeah, I got it.

{137650}{137700}-Where are we going?|-The airport.
{137720}{137759}-For what?|-Orders.
{137779}{137882}Airport? I'm not going to any airport.|I want to be taken to police headquarters.
{137888}{137915}You do, huh?
{137931}{137974}Why do you think I sent for you?
{137976}{138038}How about this guy? He sent for us!
{138046}{138068}Sit back!
{138069}{138138}Didn't you hear? I want to be taken|to police headquarters.
{138140}{138212}I'm a dangerous assassin.|I'm a mad killer on the loose!
{138214}{138267}You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
{138542}{138654}NORTHWEST
{138901}{138932}They said right here.
{138934}{139011}Does anyone mind if I sit down?|I've been running all day.
{139281}{139356}Thought I'd never make it.|Getting too old for this kind of work.
{139370}{139406}All right, men. Thank you.
{139420}{139490}This way, Mr. Thornhill.|We haven't got much time.
{139500}{139543}This way is more private.
{139637}{139679}I don't think I caught your name.
{139684}{139727}I don't think I pitched it.
{139745}{139802}You're police, aren't you? Or is it FBI?
{139812}{139901}FBI, CIA, ONI.|We're all in the same alphabet soup.
{139919}{140019}You can stick this in your alphabet soup.|I had nothing to do with that killing.
{140020}{140067}-We know that.|-You know it?
{140070}{140138}Then why did you let the police|chase me all over the map?
{140140}{140230}We never interfere with the police|unless absolutely necessary.
{140244}{140284}It has become necessary.
{140304}{140355}Then, I take it I'm to be cleared.
{140359}{140431}I wish you'd walk faster, Mr. Thornhill.|We'll miss the plane.
{140432}{140487}Where are we going?|New York or Washington?
{140488}{140537}Rapid City, South Dakota.
{140546}{140591}Rapid City? What for?
{140596}{140632}It's near Mt. Rushmore.
{140634}{140683}No, thank you. I've seen Mt. Rushmore.
{140684}{140732}So has your friend Mr. Vandamm.
{140756}{140783}Vandamm?
{140800}{140843}A rather formidable gentleman.
{140869}{140928}What about that treacherous|little tramp with him?
{140930}{140959}Miss Kendall?
{140964}{141018}His mistress. We know all about her.
{141054}{141105}Tell me, what's Vandamm up to?
{141107}{141175}You could say he's a sort|of importer-exporter.
{141181}{141206}Of what?
{141249}{141285}Government secrets, perhaps.
{141299}{141339}Then why don't you grab him?
{141342}{141412}There's still too much we don't know|about his organization.
{141414}{141502}I see. What's all this got to do|with Mt. Rushmore?
{141517}{141565}Vandamm has a place near there.
{141568}{141650}We think it's his jumping-off point|to leave the country tomorrow night.
{141652}{141710}-Are you going to stop him?|-No.
{141712}{141747}Then why are we going there?
{141760}{141811}To set his mind at ease|about George Kaplan.
{141851}{141879}Oh, you, huh?
{141880}{141925}You're George Kaplan, aren't you?
{141927}{141993}There is no such person as George Kaplan.
{141995}{142051}What do you mean? I've been in his room.
{142052}{142124}I've tried on his clothes.|He's got short sleeves and dandruff!
{142125}{142174}Believe me, he doesn't exist.
{142196}{142307}Which is why I'm going to have to ask you|to go on being him for the next 24 hours.
{142342}{142400}Come on! We'll discuss it on the plane.
{142929}{143015}You started the decoy business|without me, you finish it without me!
{143017}{143071}We might have|if you hadn't stumbled into it.
{143072}{143164}You should give me a medal and a vacation|instead of asking me to be a target...
{143166}{143233}...just so your special agent|doesn't get shot at!
{143240}{143296}Not shot at, Mr. Thornhill. Found out.
{143303}{143359}Once found out they're as good as dead.
{143365}{143444}Thanks to you,|clouds of suspicion are already forming.
{143460}{143491}Thanks to me?
{143523}{143559}You listen to me.
{143564}{143620}I'm an advertising man, not a red herring!
{143622}{143674}I've got a job, a secretary, a mother...
{143676}{143746}...two ex-wives and several bartenders|dependent upon me...
{143748}{143823}...and I don't intend to disappoint them|by getting myself killed!
{143836}{143869}The answer is no.
{143891}{143927}-Is that final?|-Yes.
{143949}{143989}-Goodbye, then.|-Goodbye.
{144001}{144086}If there was a chance of changing|your mind I'd talk about Miss Kendall...
{144108}{144156}...of whom you so obviously disapprove.
{144158}{144244}Yes, for using sex|like some people use a fly-swatter.
{144256}{144302}I suppose it doesn't matter to you...
{144304}{144401}...that she was probably forced to do|whatever she did to protect herself.
{144408}{144461}To protect herself from what?
{144463}{144515}Exposure, assassination.
{144555}{144608}You see, Mr. Thornhill, she's....
{144624}{144670}She's one of our agents.
{144695}{144718}Oh, no!
{144720}{144759}I know you didn't mean it...
{144761}{144856}...but I'm afraid you have put her|in an extremely dangerous situation.
{144900}{144958}And much more than her life is at stake.
{145308}{145342}Suppose they don't come?
{145353}{145387}They'll come.
{145426}{145503}I don't like the way Teddy Roosevelt|is looking at me.
{145510}{145604}Perhaps he's trying to give you|one last word of caution, Mr. Kaplan.
{145605}{145654}"Speak softly, and carry a big stick."
{145665}{145752}He's trying to tell me not to go through|with this harebrained scheme.
{145754}{145838}He doesn't know to what extent|you are the cause of our present trouble.
{145840}{145902}I don't know that I care|to accept that charge.
{145909}{146025}If you hadn't made yourself so attractive|to Miss Kendall that she fell for you...
{146027}{146055}And vice versa.
{146056}{146135}...our friend Vandamm wouldn't be|losing faith in her loyalty now.
{146146}{146241}It was quite obvious to him last night|that she had become emotionally involved.
{146243}{146331}Worst of all, with a man he thinks|is a government agent.
{146354}{146411}Are you trying to tell me|that I'm irresistible?
{146412}{146475}I'm trying to remind you|that it's your responsibility...
{146477}{146541}...to help us restore her|to Vandamm's good graces...
{146543}{146593}...until he leaves the country tonight.
{146613}{146644}All right, all right.
{146658}{146696}But, after tonight....
{146720}{146768}My blessings on you both!
{147119}{147142}Here they are!
{148439}{148474}Good afternoon, Mr. Kaplan.
{148476}{148500}Not her!
{148730}{148797}Did I misunderstand you|about bringing her here?
{148799}{148852}We'll get to that later.
{148871}{148924}I suppose you were surprised|to get my call.
{148926}{149016}Not at all. I knew the police|would release you, Mr. Kaplan.
{149022}{149095}By the way, I want to compliment you|on your colorful exit...
{149097}{149144}...from the auction gallery.
{149153}{149181}Thank you.
{149183}{149256}And now what little drama|are we here for today?
{149258}{149351}I don't for a moment believe that|you invited me to these gay surroundings...
{149352}{149407}...to come to a business arrangement.
{149444}{149548}Suppose I tell you that I not only know|when you're leaving the country tonight...
{149550}{149611}...but the latitude and longitude|of your rendezvous...
{149613}{149663}...and your ultimate destination.
{149674}{149737}You wouldn't care to carry my bags,|would you?
{149743}{149818}Perhaps you'd be interested in the price,|just the same.
{149823}{149849}The price?
{149851}{149899}For doing nothing to stop you.
{149938}{149993}How much did you have in mind?
{150008}{150035}I want the girl.
{150106}{150155}I want her to get what's coming to her.
{150180}{150266}Turn her over to me. I'll see there's|enough pinned on her to keep her...
{150268}{150319}...uncomfortable for the rest of her life.
{150349}{150418}You do that,|and I'll look the other way tonight.
{150431}{150478}She really did get under your skin.
{150487}{150556}We're not talking about my skin.|We're talking about yours.
{150557}{150637}-I'm offering you a chance to save it.|-To exchange it!
{150668}{150701}Put it any way you like.
{150713}{150762}I'm curious, Mr. Kaplan.
{150775}{150878}What made you think that my feelings|for her may have deteriorated...
{150880}{150960}...to the point where I would trade her in|for a little peace of mind?
{150992}{151027}I don't deduce.
{151032}{151059}I observe.
{151124}{151203}Phillip, if you don't mind,|I'm going back to the house now.
{151502}{151531}Just a second, you.
{151532}{151602}Stay away from me! Let go!|Let go of me!
{151628}{151676}Stay away from me! Let go!
{151680}{151710}Let go of me!
{151724}{151759}Save the phony tears.
{151760}{151796}You just get back.
{151850}{151876}You little fool!
{151878}{151921}You just stay away from me.
{152056}{152109}No good. You can't get involved in this.
{152218}{152269}-Don't touch anything.|-Stand back.
{152277}{152299}Stand back.
{153768}{153799}Don't be long.
{153893}{153918}Hello.
{153950}{153975}Hello.
{153995}{154028}Are you all right?
{154058}{154095}Yes, I think so.
{154109}{154174}I asked the Professor|if I could see you again.
{154233}{154278}There's not much time.
{154313}{154345}Isn't there?
{154366}{154412}I wanted to tell you....
{154421}{154456}I mean, apologize.
{154492}{154518}No need.
{154552}{154584}I understand.
{154643}{154683}All in the line of duty.
{154721}{154771}I did treat you miserably.
{154824}{154865}I hated you for it.
{154883}{154932}I didn't want you to go on thinking....
{155000}{155059}I used some pretty harsh words, I'm sorry.
{155069}{155134}-They hurt deeply.|-Naturally, if I'd known....
{155144}{155183}I couldn't tell you.
{155204}{155237}-Of course not.|-Could l?
{155282}{155315}No, I guess not.
{155364}{155419}You didn't get hurt. I'm so relieved.
{155421}{155468}Of course I was. How would you have felt?
{155469}{155552}I mean in the cafeteria, when you fell.|When I shot you with the blanks.
{155554}{155590}Oh, that. No.
{155612}{155659}You did it rather well, I thought.
{155660}{155715}Yes, I thought I was quite graceful.
{155729}{155791}Considering it's not really|your kind of work.
{155824}{155905}No, I got into it by accident.|What's your excuse?
{155959}{156051}I met Phillip Vandamm at a party one night|and saw only his charm.
{156134}{156204}I guess I had nothing to do that weekend...
{156205}{156260}...so I decided to fall in love.
{156275}{156307}That's nice.
{156350}{156446}Eventually, the Professor and his|Washington colleagues approached me...
{156482}{156571}...with a few sordid details about Phillip|and he told me that...
{156595}{156690}...my relationship with him|made me "uniquely valuable" to them.
{156731}{156779}So you became a Girl Scout?
{156809}{156888}It was the first time anyone ever asked me|to do anything worthwhile.
{156945}{156979}Has life been like that?
{157057}{157077}How come?
{157144}{157173}Men like you.
{157213}{157268}What's wrong with men like me?
{157275}{157330}They don't believe in marriage.
{157332}{157375}I've been married twice.
{157376}{157408}See what I mean?
{157462}{157527}I may go back to hating you.|It was more fun.
{157691}{157729}Goodbye, darling.
{157762}{157790}Wait. Not so soon.
{157799}{157843}I must get back and convince them...
{157845}{157917}...that I took the long way|so nobody would follow me.
{157966}{158023}Couldn't we stand like this|for just a few hours?
{158024}{158086}Just this time you're supposed|to be critically wounded!
{158088}{158128}I never felt more alive.
{158137}{158168}Whose side are you on?
{158198}{158230}Yours, always, darling.
{158257}{158342}Please don't undermine my resolve,|just when I need it most.
{158548}{158640}I guess it's off to the hospital for me|and back to danger for you.
{158644}{158686}I don't like it a bit.
{158692}{158776}It's much safer now, thanks to you,|my darling decoy.
{158790}{158843}Don't thank me. I couldn't stand it.
{158844}{158885}All right. I won't.
{158887}{158964}After your malevolent friend Vandamm|takes off tonight...
{158968}{159067}...we'll get together and do a lot of|apologizing to each other, in private.
{159070}{159107}You know that can't be.
{159108}{159151}Of course it can be!
{159229}{159279}He has told you, hasn't he?
{159292}{159321}Told me what?
{159336}{159371}You've got to get moving.
{159394}{159447}-What didn't you tell me?|-Why didn't you?
{159472}{159540}She's going off with Vandamm tonight|on the plane.
{159589}{159627}She's going off with Vandamm?
{159628}{159710}That's why we went to such lengths|to make her a fugitive from justice.
{159712}{159780}So that Vandamm couldn't decline|to take her along.
{159784}{159854}I needn't tell you how valuable|she can be to us over there.
{159872}{159926}You lied to me!|You said that after tonight--
{159931}{159960}I needed your help.
{159962}{159993}You got it, all right.
{159995}{160024}Don't be angry.
{160026}{160096}-You think I'll let you go through with this?|-She has to.
{160104}{160148}Nobody has to do anything!
{160152}{160200}I don't like the games you play!
{160224}{160293}War is hell, Mr. Thornhill,|even when it's a cold one.
{160317}{160373}If you can't lick the Vandamms|of this world...
{160384}{160454}...without asking girls to bed down|and fly away with them...
{160459}{160499}...and probably never come back...
{160501}{160567}...perhaps you should learn|how to lose a few cold wars.
{160582}{160617}We're already doing that.
{160801}{160890}-I won't let you do this. Get out.|-Please don't spoil everything.
{161022}{161124}...shot Mr. Kaplan twice in full view|of horrified men, women and children...
{161126}{161207}...who had come to the park|to see the famed Mt. Rushmore monument.
{161208}{161343}Witnesses described the assailant as|an attractive blonde in her late twenties.
{161348}{161440}Kaplan, who was taken to the hospital|in critical condition...
{161442}{161540}...has been tentatively identified|as an employee of the federal government.
{161542}{161604}The tragedy developed|with startling suddenness.
{161606}{161682}Chris Swenson,|a busboy in the Mt. Rushmore cafeteria...
{161684}{161755}...stated that he heard voices raised in--
{161901}{161929}Here we are.
{161955}{162011}Slacks, a shirt and these.
{162024}{162053}Thanks.
{162055}{162133}That'll do for you around here|for the next couple of days.
{162157}{162204}The next couple of days?
{162233}{162268}Hey, what's this?
{162285}{162363}That's where I hit the chair|doing that phony fall in the cafeteria.
{162364}{162422}You and your dopey schemes. Shooting.
{162424}{162495}-Otherwise, feeling all right?|-Oh, yes. Fine.
{162516}{162593}Considering your driver has|a sledgehammer for a hand.
{162597}{162641}Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
{162645}{162706}That's all right. I guess I deserved it.
{162724}{162780}I guess I deserve that locked door, too.
{162782}{162874}If you were seen wandering about healthy,|it could prove fatal to Miss Kendall.
{162898}{162963}-I've begun to forget her already.|-Good.
{162976}{163028}-Better that way.|-Yeah, much.
{163039}{163091}Inside of an hour, she'll be gone.
{163164}{163209}How's everything out in Rapid City?
{163211}{163251}Everything's fine.
{163260}{163352}Mr. Kaplan's untimely shooting has|acquired the authority of the printed word.
{163364}{163422}Everyone's been cooperating beautifully.
{163424}{163457}Now you can include me.
{163474}{163526}-I'm a cooperator.|-I'm most grateful.
{163545}{163617}-Care to do me a favor in return?|-Anything.
{163619}{163684}I'd like a drink.|Will you get me some bourbon?
{163693}{163727}A pint will do.
{163747}{163775}Can I join you?
{163776}{163855}If you're gonna join me,|you better make it a quart.
{163856}{163898}See you in a few minutes.
{165465}{165505}-Stop!|-Excuse me.
{165536}{165560}Stop.
{166140}{166238}-Don't you want me to take you up there?|-No, thanks. Never mind. This is fine.
{170200}{170273}-There's nothing to worry about.|-I just lost my head.
{170287}{170354}I'm not just saying this|to make you feel better.
{170358}{170387}I mean it.
{170398}{170448}I just didn't know what I was doing.
{170450}{170513}He wants to destroy you.|You had to protect yourself.
{170515}{170551}But not endanger you!
{170553}{170576}Rubbish.
{170590}{170686}Soon we'll be off together and I shall|dedicate myself to your happiness.
{170725}{170771}What's the situation, Leonard?
{170777}{170831}-About the plane, you mean?|-Of course.
{170833}{170871}What was the last report?
{170875}{170948}Over Whitestone on the hour.|6,000. Descending.
{170954}{171004}-About ten minutes?|-At the most.
{171030}{171056}And now....
{171074}{171146}I wonder if I might have a few words|of parting with you, sir?
{171148}{171177}Certainly.
{171197}{171228}In private?
{171264}{171293}I'll get my things.
{171357}{171399}How does one say goodbye...
{171407}{171444}...to one's right arm?
{171605}{171666}In your case,|you'll wish you had cut it off sooner.
{171780}{171834}I know you're terribly fond|of Miss Kendall....
{172923}{172971}It couldn't have been anything.
{173052}{173116}You must've had some doubts|about her yourself.
{173153}{173177}And still do.
{173185}{173212}Rubbish.
{173227}{173288}Why else would you've decided|not to tell her that...
{173295}{173360}...our little treasure here|has a bellyful of microfilm?
{173362}{173425}You seem to be trying to fill mine|with rotten apples.
{173427}{173492}Sometimes the truth does taste|like worms.
{173493}{173539}I've heard nothing but innuendoes.
{173541}{173630}Call it my "woman's intuition" if you will,|but I've never trusted neatness.
{173632}{173693}Neatness is always the result|of deliberate planning.
{173695}{173754}She shot him in a moment|of fear and anger.
{173758}{173803}You were there, you saw it yourself.
{173809}{173831}Yes.
{173887}{173985}And thereby wrapped everything up|into one very neat and tidy bundle.
{174039}{174107}A: She removed any doubts|you may have had about her.
{174109}{174172}What did you call it? Her "devotion"?
{174178}{174277}B: She gave herself an urgent reason|to be taken to the other side with you...
{174279}{174331}...in case you decided to change your mind.
{174392}{174431}I think you're jealous.
{174437}{174488}No, I mean it. I'm very touched.
{174580}{174607}Leonard!
{174786}{174824}The gun she shot Kaplan with.
{174841}{174875}I found it in her luggage.
{174908}{175003}It's an old trick. Shoot one of your own|to show that you're not one of them.
{175016}{175083}They've just freshened it up a bit|with blank cartridges.
{175424}{175452}What was that noise?
{175521}{175593}Yes, we wondered what it was, too.|Didn't we, Leonard?
{175625}{175676}Hurry down, darling. It's time to leave.
{175687}{175711}In a moment.
{175934}{175993}You're not taking her on that plane|with you?
{175994}{176022}Of course I am.
{176050}{176123}Like our friends,|l, too, believe in neatness, Leonard.
{176142}{176220}This matter is best disposed of|from a great height...
{176243}{176272}...over water.
{177400}{177452}How about a little champagne|before we go?
{177454}{177486}I'd love it.
{177489}{177527}It may not be cold enough.
{177529}{177571}On the rocks it'll be all right.
{177573}{177600}Are you sure?
{177865}{177892}R.O.T.
{178276}{178326}They're on to you.
{178449}{178512}I'm in your room.
{179446}{179472}To you, my dear...
{179474}{179532}...and all the lovely moments|we've had together.
{179559}{179579}Thank you.
{179605}{179626}There he is.
{179816}{179873}Jump in, Leonard. The champagne's fine.
{179882}{179919}There isn't time.
{179921}{179981}You always were a spoilsport, weren't you?
{179991}{180037}One of my most valuable attributes...
{180041}{180073}...as it now turns out.
{180133}{180228}It would please me if you'd think of me|as being along on this journey...
{180245}{180282}...if only in spirit.
{180286}{180310}I shall.
{180502}{180575}He's heading pretty far out|on the north flag and awfully high.
{180601}{180680}I guess he's going to play it safe|with a long, slow descent.
{180705}{180761}You couldn't ask|for a better night than this.
{180763}{180817}Ceiling and possibilities unlimited.
{180868}{180921}There he goes, starting his turn.
{180953}{180992}We'd better get moving.
{181038}{181119}He should have his wheels on the ground|inside of three minutes.
{181215}{181259}-Come along, Eve.|-All right.
{181318}{181399}I think I left my earrings upstairs.|I'll be right down.
{181714}{181778}We can go through the window.|There's a car downstairs!
{181780}{181834}What are you doing?|You'll ruin everything!
{181836}{181897}They know about the fake shooting!|They'll kill you!
{181899}{181925}What?
{181928}{181980}Leonard found the gun in your luggage!
{181983}{182060}The figure they got at the auction|is filled with microfilm!
{182062}{182120}That's how he's been getting it.
{182140}{182191}Whatever you do, don't get on that plane!
{182372}{182445}Don't worry, Anna.|Arrangements have been made.
{182451}{182516}You and your husband will be|in Canada by morning.
{182517}{182564}-Thank you very much, sir.|-Be careful.
{182565}{182584}We will.
{182594}{182618}God bless you!
{184189}{184217}Stay where you are!
{184496}{184519}Sit down.
{184636}{184716}As soon as the plane leaves,|my husband and Mr. Leonard will be back.
{185390}{185421}What is it?
{185453}{185496}I was wondering about my earrings.
{185498}{185531}They'll turn up.
{185639}{185711}When you return to New York,|say goodbye to my sister.
{185719}{185775}Thank her for her performance|as Mrs. Townsend.
{185800}{185882}Tell your knife-throwing chum|that I've reassured his wife.
{185896}{185926}That's all, Leonard.
{186307}{186336}Get that figure back!
{186510}{186568}The housekeeper had me pinned down|for five minutes...
{186570}{186627}...before I realized|it was that silly gun of yours.
{186629}{186672}-I see you've got the pumpkin.|-Yes.
{187619}{187684}This is no good.|We're on top of the monument.
{188120}{188162}-What'll we do?|-Climb down.
{188164}{188187}We can't.
{188190}{188242}Here they come. We have no choice.
{189436}{189482}If we ever get out of this alive...
{189484}{189543}...let's go back to New York|on the train together.
{189545}{189572}All right?
{189584}{189622}Is that a proposition?
{189653}{189696}It's a proposal, sweetie.
{189725}{189784}What happened to the first two marriages?
{189806}{189849}My wives divorced me.
{189862}{189882}Why?
{189884}{189945}I think they said I led too dull a life.
{189972}{189992}Come on.
{190241}{190267}Are you all right?
{190521}{190544}Come on.
{194641}{194659}Help!
{194671}{194698}Help me!
{195461}{195489}Thank you, Sergeant.
{195491}{195557}That wasn't very sporting,|using real bullets?
{195564}{195599}Here, reach. Now.
{195629}{195656}I'm trying.
{195661}{195692}Come on, I've got you.
{195695}{195744}-Up!|-I can't make it!
{195753}{195776}Yes, you can.
{195777}{195796}Come on.
{195797}{195819}Pull harder!
{195829}{195868}Come along, Mrs. Thornhill.
{195973}{196012}Roger, this is silly.
{196020}{196069}I know, but I'm sentimental.
