1
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:17,805
You told me... "I love you. "
I told you... "Wait. "

2
00:00:17,913 --> 00:00:21,110
I almost said... "Yes. "
You said... "Go. "

3
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:31,885
JULES AND JIM

4
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:46,136
With the Little
SABINE HAUDEPIN

5
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:49,802
With
And the voice of

6
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:53,740
Based on the novel by

7
00:00:54,316 --> 00:00:59,276
Adaptation and Dialogue by
Directed by

8
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:02,187
Edited by

9
00:01:02,524 --> 00:01:05,357
Jammin' tunes by

10
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:08,595
Song written by

11
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:11,496
Director of Photography

12
00:01:18,707 --> 00:01:20,299
It was around 1912.

13
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:23,002
Jules, a foreigner in Paris,
asked Jim, whom he hardly knew,

14
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:24,840
together into the Art Students' Ball.

15
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:28,006
Jim got him a ticket
and a costume.

16
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:32,075
While Jules was hunting for
a slave costume...

17
00:01:32,187 --> 00:01:34,417
their friendship was born.

18
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:39,118
It grew as Jules watched the ball
with his kind tender eyes.

19
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:43,692
The next day, they had
their first real conversation.

20
00:01:43,798 --> 00:01:46,824
Each taught the other his language
and his culture until late at night.

21
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:49,699
They translated
each other's poetry.

22
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:53,068
They shared
an indifference for money.

23
00:01:53,174 --> 00:01:56,803
They talked,
and they listened to each other.

24
00:01:56,912 --> 00:01:59,745
Jules had no girls in Paris
and he wanted one.

25
00:01:59,848 --> 00:02:03,477
Jim had several.
He introduced Jules to musician.

26
00:02:03,585 --> 00:02:07,282
They were in love for about a week.

27
00:02:07,389 --> 00:02:12,258
Then came a sweet thing
who loved to talk all night.

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,523
And a pretty blonde widow
who made them a trio.

29
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,825
She confused Jules.
She found him nice, but clumsy.

30
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:21,164
She brought him a quiet friend
who was too quiet.

31
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:24,466
Despite Jim's advice, Jules
got in contact with professionals...

32
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:26,733
but found no satisfaction.

33
00:02:32,247 --> 00:02:33,680
Let's get to work.

34
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,390
"Down with everything"

35
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:53,467
No more paint, you bitch.

36
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,593
They'll say
anarchists can't spell, again.

37
00:02:57,973 --> 00:02:59,565
Save me! He's after me!

38
00:02:59,674 --> 00:03:01,835
He's stronger than you!
Let's run!

39
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:05,270
Can you put me up for the night?

40
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,439
- I'm Therese.
- Of course, Therese.

41
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:09,779
You can't stay with me.
I've got a date.

42
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:14,116
Gilberte? But Jules can...
That's me...

43
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:16,588
And who're you?
Jim and Jules, then?

44
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:18,625
No, Jules and Jim.

45
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:43,643
What's that?

46
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:49,446
It's better than a clock.
When the sand stops, I must go to sleep.

47
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,676
-You'll sleep here and me there.
- I see.

48
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:11,371
- Got a cigarette?
- Of course.

49
00:04:14,315 --> 00:04:16,476
- Are you Jim?
- No, Jules.

50
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:19,448
You're sweet.

51
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,759
I'll show you a steam engine.

52
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,442
It's almost dawn.

53
00:04:46,548 --> 00:04:49,813
Jim, you might stay here
with me for once.

54
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:51,408
No, Gilberte.

55
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,579
If I stayed only once,
I'd feel guilty.

56
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:58,090
If I stayed longer,
we'd be almost married.

57
00:04:58,193 --> 00:05:01,356
- That's against our rules!
- What a twisted mind.

58
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:04,330
And the cat doesn't like
to stay at home alone.

59
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:07,026
Besides, it's morning.

60
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:10,104
Just imagine that I'm going to work.

61
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:18,374
You're going home to sleep until noon.

62
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:43,670
No, it was Shakespeare.

63
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:50,171
Give me a dime for the music.

64
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:53,543
It was Shakespeare,
I tell you.

65
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:03,220
Do you have a cigarette?

66
00:06:11,032 --> 00:06:14,092
Can you put me up for the night?
I'm Therese.

67
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:27,238
Forget it. There are more
where she came from.

68
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:31,679
I wasn't in love with her.

69
00:06:31,786 --> 00:06:34,482
She was both mother and daughter to me.

70
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:39,151
I'm not lucky in Paris.

71
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,127
Good thing I know girls back home.

72
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:44,592
I love one, Lucie.

73
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,997
She refused to marry me.

74
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:50,264
I've decided to wait 6 months,
and ask her again.

75
00:06:51,506 --> 00:06:54,270
There's another, too.
Birgitta.

76
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,605
And there's Elga.

77
00:06:56,711 --> 00:07:00,044
I'd love her
if I didn't love Lucie.

78
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:02,639
This is what she looks like.

79
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:10,615
Jules sketched a woman's face
on the table.

80
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:15,322
Jim wanted to buy the table...

81
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,263
but the owner wanted
to sell the whole set.

82
00:07:21,936 --> 00:07:22,903
Albert.

83
00:07:24,405 --> 00:07:26,066
This is Jim, a French friend.

84
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:34,080
Hello. I think we've met before.

85
00:07:36,184 --> 00:07:37,742
Sit down.

86
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:44,084
-Jim had asked...
- Who is Albert?

87
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:46,922
The artists' friend.

88
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:50,794
He knows everyone
who'll be famous in ten years.

89
00:07:55,036 --> 00:07:57,231
This is more exotic.

90
00:07:57,338 --> 00:08:00,330
She looks like an Incan statue.

91
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:05,443
This one is somewhat Romanesque.

92
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:09,607
It's weathered because
I found it in the garden.

93
00:08:09,717 --> 00:08:11,776
It was out in the rain for years.

94
00:08:11,886 --> 00:08:15,947
This one is very touching.

95
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:20,994
Reminds you of a decaying face.

96
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:25,259
Strange to see stone
worked so flabbily.

97
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:32,999
This face has beautiful lips.

98
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:35,837
They're scornful.
Admirable eyes, too.

99
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,840
May we see that last one again?

100
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:47,553
I made a close-up of it, too.

101
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:49,885
The slide showed
a woman's face...

102
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:52,482
whose tranquil smile gripped them.

103
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:57,898
The statue was in an outdoor museum
on an Adriatic island.

104
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:00,467
They left immediately to see it.

105
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:02,559
They wore
the same white outfits.

106
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:12,874
They stared at the face
for an hour.

107
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,107
It stunned them into silence.

108
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:18,913
They were speechless.
Had they ever met such a smile?

109
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,581
No. If they ever met it,
they would follow it.

110
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:26,956
Jules and Jim
returned home dazzled.

111
00:09:27,795 --> 00:09:28,853
Paris greeted them gently.

112
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:50,747
- How is your book?
- It's coming along.

113
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:56,119
It will be rather autobiographical.

114
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:58,954
Our friendship had
a major part in it.

115
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,527
I'd love to have you read
an excerpt from it.

116
00:10:00,628 --> 00:10:01,720
Please do.

117
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:11,294
"Jacques and Julien were inseparable.

118
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:13,636
Julien's last novel
was successful.

119
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:16,608
In it, he described
the enchanting women he had known...

120
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:19,407
...before he had met Jacques
and even Lucienne.

121
00:10:19,514 --> 00:10:21,379
Jacques was proud of Julien.

122
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:23,312
People called them
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza...

123
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:26,751
and they never knew that neighbors
found their friendship ambiguous.

124
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:28,913
They ate together
in small restaurants.

125
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:32,652
They bought for one another
the best cigars."

126
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,557
It's beautiful.

127
00:10:34,662 --> 00:10:39,258
Let me translate it into German.

128
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:41,096
Now, for a shower.

129
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,200
My cousin just wrote me.

130
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:51,267
Three girls he knows
are coming to Paris.

131
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:54,212
One is German, one is Dutch,
and one is French.

132
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:57,307
They're coming to dinner tomorrow.

133
00:10:57,418 --> 00:10:59,352
I want you to join us.

134
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:08,518
Catherine, the French girl,
was the statue.

135
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:10,859
She had the same smile, nose,
mouth, chin, and forehead.

136
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:13,262
As a child, she had
been idolized in her hometown...

137
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:14,732
during religious celebration.

138
00:11:14,836 --> 00:11:16,167
It started almost like a dream.

139
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,331
As your host, I propose...

140
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:25,401
that we would abolish
all formalities forever...

141
00:11:25,713 --> 00:11:30,309
by drinking my best wine
in brotherhood.

142
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:34,184
Instead of linking arms
in the usual way...

143
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:37,815
let us touch feet under the table.

144
00:11:37,925 --> 00:11:41,520
Jules was happy
and moved his feet away.

145
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:44,029
Jim's foot stayed near Catherine's.

146
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:46,395
She moved hers away first.

147
00:11:47,902 --> 00:11:50,336
Jules smiled happily...

148
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:52,668
as he beamed at the others.

149
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:56,133
Jules vanished for a month.

150
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:57,711
He saw Catherine alone...

151
00:11:57,812 --> 00:12:01,077
but the two friends
met at the gymnasium.

152
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:05,847
Excellent.

153
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:09,653
Why don't you spend the evening
with Catherine and me?

154
00:12:13,594 --> 00:12:15,323
I've talked about you so much...

155
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:19,490
Catherine is anxious
to know you better...

156
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,263
but not this one, Jim. Okay?

157
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:32,439
Hello, Mr. Jim.

158
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,113
Pronounce his name in English,
not French.

159
00:12:43,057 --> 00:12:45,821
"Jeem" doesn't suit him.

160
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:55,426
Do you like our friend Thomas?

161
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,097
Can we go out with him?

162
00:12:58,773 --> 00:13:02,402
Not bad. A moustache would help.

163
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:17,148
Now for a test in the street.

164
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:30,902
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a match?

165
00:13:36,277 --> 00:13:37,642
Thank you, sir.

166
00:13:40,748 --> 00:13:42,841
She was proud
of her clever disguise.

167
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,113
The men were moved,
but didn't really understand why.

168
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,519
- Either it's raining or I'm dreaming!
- It might be both.

169
00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:00,294
Then if it's raining,
let's go to the seashore.

170
00:14:00,868 --> 00:14:01,857
We go tomorrow.

171
00:14:03,904 --> 00:14:06,896
Let's have a race.

172
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:09,704
First one to the end of the bridge.

173
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:37,529
- You cheated.
- But I won.

174
00:14:37,638 --> 00:14:38,935
Thomas always wins.

175
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,907
He speaks three languages,
he swims like a fish.

176
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:43,567
Can he stand on his hands?

177
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:45,009
You'll teach him.

178
00:14:46,647 --> 00:14:49,411
Can you come to my flat tomorrow...

179
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:52,918
to help take my baggage
to the station?

180
00:14:55,022 --> 00:14:56,182
She's a strange breed.

181
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,851
Her father was an aristocrat,
her mother wasn't.

182
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,260
He came from Burgundy.
Her mother was English.

183
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:06,856
That's why she's not average...

184
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:09,299
and she teaches everyone.

185
00:15:09,403 --> 00:15:11,871
- Teaches what?
- Shakespeare.

186
00:15:14,508 --> 00:15:18,171
Jim took it for granted
that she belonged to Jules.

187
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:21,043
Catherine wore that calm smile.

188
00:15:21,148 --> 00:15:24,083
It was natural and said everything.

189
00:15:28,823 --> 00:15:31,417
I'm almost ready.
I just have to put on my dress.

190
00:15:32,126 --> 00:15:34,492
- Never put a hat on a bed.
- Do we take the bike?

191
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:44,563
And the bag, too?

192
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:50,839
- What are you doing?
- I want to burn lies.

193
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:53,676
Give me a match.

194
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:06,549
- Oh, my God!
- Don't move.

195
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:21,169
- Are you alright?
- Hand me the dress.

196
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:22,537
It's by the bed.

197
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:31,440
- Got a broom?
- It's under your nose.

198
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,802
Can you help me?

199
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:04,384
Thanks.

200
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:12,018
We'll take this, too.

201
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:14,685
What is it?

202
00:17:14,795 --> 00:17:17,525
Vitriol, for the eyes of men who lie.

203
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:20,433
That bottle will break
and ruin your things.

204
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:22,695
Besides, you can buy Vitriol anywhere.

205
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:24,930
- Is that true?
- Yes.

206
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,030
But not this bottle.

207
00:17:27,141 --> 00:17:29,439
I swore I'd only use this bottle.

208
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:11,950
It took them a while...

209
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:15,510
to find the house of their dreams
along the coast.

210
00:18:15,623 --> 00:18:18,786
It was too big and isolated,
solemn, white, and empty.

211
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:24,393
- Sleep well?
- Very well.

212
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:27,763
- Is Jim awake?
- I don't know.

213
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,638
- How is everyone else?
- Everyone else is fine.

214
00:18:37,544 --> 00:18:38,772
What a nice day.

215
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,705
Hurry, let's go to the beach.

216
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:51,249
Let's find the last signs
of civilization.

217
00:18:51,358 --> 00:18:53,087
A piece of tire.

218
00:18:56,397 --> 00:19:01,130
- Look, a bottle!
- An old shoe.

219
00:19:10,577 --> 00:19:14,536
A can!
Watch out back there.

220
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:22,282
Look, Catherine.

221
00:19:28,028 --> 00:19:30,496
Watch out, it's steep.

222
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:36,233
A postcard.

223
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:43,709
A piece of porcelain.

224
00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:47,813
A cup and a cigarette butt.

225
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:57,981
- A pack of English cigarettes.
- I'm afraid we're lost, kids.

226
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,470
Do you think I should marry her?

227
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:17,567
Answer me honestly.

228
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:20,112
Is she cut out
to be a wife and mother?

229
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:23,877
I'm afraid she will never
be happy on this earth.

230
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:27,351
She has a vision. Maybe
she can't belong to just one man.

231
00:20:27,454 --> 00:20:29,581
- Let's go.
- No.

232
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,420
This time, I won't move.
I give up.

233
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:51,438
Help me, kids.

234
00:21:07,494 --> 00:21:10,258
Let's go, kids.

235
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:37,086
At last, I read a book I liked.

236
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:39,819
A writer, a German, of course...

237
00:21:39,927 --> 00:21:42,623
who dares to say out loud
what I think inside.

238
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:46,358
The sky that we see is merely
a small hollow ball...

239
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:48,435
no bigger than that.

240
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:52,562
And we walk
with our heads towards the center.

241
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:07,314
The attraction pulls towards
the outside under our feet...

242
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:11,619
towards that solid crust
in which the bubble is enclosed.

243
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:13,693
How thick is the crust
and what's beyond it?

244
00:22:13,794 --> 00:22:14,761
Go and see.

245
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:17,490
That's not a question
to discuss between gentlemen.

246
00:22:30,244 --> 00:22:32,303
Answer me tomorrow, Catherine.

247
00:22:32,412 --> 00:22:33,811
If you say no...

248
00:22:33,914 --> 00:22:38,578
I will ask you every year again
on your birthday.

249
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:40,243
You've known few women.

250
00:22:40,354 --> 00:22:43,255
I've known plenty of men.
It averages out.

251
00:22:43,357 --> 00:22:46,292
We might make an honest couple.

252
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,003
I've proposed to her.
She almost said yes.

253
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:13,384
At fifteen,
I was in love with Napoleon.

254
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,487
I dreamt I met him in an elevator.

255
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,525
We had a child
and I never saw him again.

256
00:23:21,061 --> 00:23:22,892
Poor Napoleon.

257
00:23:23,297 --> 00:23:25,925
I was taught:
Our father who arts in heaven.

258
00:23:26,033 --> 00:23:28,763
I thought it said arts.

259
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:33,704
I imagined my father with an easel
painting in Paradise.

260
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:38,444
I believe I've said something funny.

261
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:43,245
At least, amusing.
You might try to smile.

262
00:23:51,892 --> 00:23:55,487
Will anyone present
scratch my back?

263
00:23:55,596 --> 00:23:57,962
The Lord scratches
those who scratch themselves.

264
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,234
The Lord scratches those...

265
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,735
You two taught me how to laugh.

266
00:24:08,842 --> 00:24:10,571
Before, I always looked glum.

267
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:20,578
But that's all over.

268
00:24:30,697 --> 00:24:33,996
It's raining. Come and see.

269
00:24:38,105 --> 00:24:40,835
I miss Paris.
Let's go back, please.

270
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:43,068
We'll be there tomorrow night.

271
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:08,394
I've sold my book.

272
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:11,362
This is for Catherine.

273
00:25:11,938 --> 00:25:13,303
This is for both of you.

274
00:25:16,677 --> 00:25:20,443
- What is it?
- A back-scratcher.

275
00:25:28,722 --> 00:25:31,589
I'm taking you
to the theater tonight.

276
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:37,559
- What will we see?
- A new Swedish play.

277
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:40,696
It starts at nine.

278
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:43,964
When the sand stops,
we'll get dressed.

279
00:25:46,473 --> 00:25:49,067
Jim saw his friends often.

280
00:25:49,176 --> 00:25:51,610
He liked to be with them.

281
00:25:51,712 --> 00:25:55,739
Jules' two pillows
were now side by side.

282
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:58,283
Catherine learned to live again.

283
00:26:11,131 --> 00:26:13,099
I still like that girl.

284
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:17,535
She wants to be free.
She invents her own life.

285
00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:20,003
- Doesn't Jim agree?
- No.

286
00:26:20,974 --> 00:26:22,441
It's a confused
and self-indulging play.

287
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:25,170
The writer revels in vice
to preach virtue.

288
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,509
We don't even know
when or where it's taking place.

289
00:26:28,615 --> 00:26:31,607
He doesn't say
if the heroine is a virgin.

290
00:26:32,252 --> 00:26:33,776
That's not important.

291
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:38,551
Usually not, but since he explains
that the hero is impotent...

292
00:26:38,658 --> 00:26:40,990
that his brother is gay
and that the sister is a nymphomaniac...

293
00:26:41,094 --> 00:26:43,562
why should he dismiss the heroine?

294
00:26:43,663 --> 00:26:45,597
That's all in your mind.

295
00:26:45,699 --> 00:26:48,224
Yes, and you help us think of it.

296
00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:50,798
No psychology tonight.

297
00:26:50,904 --> 00:26:53,702
It's not psychology,
it's metaphysics.

298
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:57,243
In a couple,
the wife must be faithful.

299
00:26:57,344 --> 00:26:59,710
The husband doesn't count.

300
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:04,045
Who wrote: "Woman is natural,
therefore abominable?"

301
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:07,120
Baudelaire. But he meant
a certain class.

302
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,587
Not at all.
He meant women in general.

303
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,885
Here's how he describes
a young girl:

304
00:27:12,993 --> 00:27:17,760
"Monster, assassin of the arts.
Little fool, little slut.

305
00:27:17,864 --> 00:27:21,391
A blend of idiocy and depravity."

306
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:24,698
Wait, that's not all.
This is marvelous:

307
00:27:24,805 --> 00:27:29,174
"I wonder why women are
allowed to enter churches.

308
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:33,440
What could they hope
to say to God?"

309
00:27:34,881 --> 00:27:37,145
- You're a pair of fools.
- I haven't said anything.

310
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,811
And I don't approve
of what Jules says at 2 in the morning.

311
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:45,189
- Then protest!
- I am protesting.

312
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:56,168
Jim never forgot that jump.

313
00:27:56,269 --> 00:27:59,534
He drew it the next day,
though he was not an artist.

314
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:02,699
His admiration for Catherine
struck him like lightning...

315
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:04,777
as he blew her an invisible kiss.

316
00:28:04,878 --> 00:28:05,845
He didn't worry.

317
00:28:05,946 --> 00:28:09,609
He was swimming with her mentally,
and held his breath to frighten Jules.

318
00:28:10,717 --> 00:28:11,911
Catherine, why?

319
00:28:15,956 --> 00:28:17,116
You're crazy.

320
00:28:29,135 --> 00:28:31,330
Her hat drifted away.

321
00:28:41,615 --> 00:28:44,607
Jules was pale, silent,
unsure of himself, and more handsome.

322
00:28:44,718 --> 00:28:49,348
Catherine had a triumphant smile.

323
00:28:49,456 --> 00:28:50,980
No one spoke about her jump.

324
00:28:53,627 --> 00:28:56,858
- I've arrived.
- Please, Mr. Jim.

325
00:28:56,963 --> 00:29:00,126
- No, just Jim.
-Just Jim.

326
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,292
I want to ask you some advice.

327
00:29:04,838 --> 00:29:08,467
Can you meet me tomorrow
at 7 in our caf?

328
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:09,667
Yes.

329
00:29:09,776 --> 00:29:14,042
- She wants to talk to you.
- Right, I'll be there at 7.

330
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:36,435
- Are you joking?
- I never joke.

331
00:29:36,536 --> 00:29:38,800
I've no sense of humor.

332
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,701
I know people who have.
My wife's friends, working relations.

333
00:29:44,811 --> 00:29:47,575
But personally, I never joke.

334
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,647
Jim was late, as usual,
Because he was an optimist.

335
00:29:53,753 --> 00:29:56,847
He was afraid she had already left.

336
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,323
Jim thought.. 'A girl like that...

337
00:30:00,427 --> 00:30:03,055
would probably not have waited.

338
00:30:03,163 --> 00:30:05,256
A girl like that
might have just walked in...

339
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:08,493
without noticing me
behind my newspaper, and left. "

340
00:30:08,602 --> 00:30:11,503
He kept repeating...
"A girl like that."

341
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:13,266
But what was she like?

342
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:16,536
For the first time,
he began to think of her.

343
00:30:20,714 --> 00:30:22,682
Another coffee, please.

344
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:27,719
Another glass.

345
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:19,530
Did I wake you up, Jim?

346
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:23,097
We're going to my country,
to get married.

347
00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:29,571
Tell her I'm sorry I was late.
I waited almost till 8.

348
00:31:29,683 --> 00:31:32,117
She's more optimistic than you.

349
00:31:32,218 --> 00:31:35,187
She was at the hairdresser...

350
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:37,654
andarrivedat8
to have dinner with you.

351
00:31:37,757 --> 00:31:41,124
If I had known she'd come,
I could have waited until midnight.

352
00:31:41,227 --> 00:31:45,061
Catherine wants to speak to you.

353
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:49,066
I'm very happy, Jim.

354
00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:51,763
Jules will teach me French boxing.

355
00:31:51,871 --> 00:31:54,601
With an Austrian accent.

356
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:58,906
I've lost my accent!
My French is perfect!

357
00:31:59,012 --> 00:32:00,604
Listen to the Marseillaise.

358
00:32:35,115 --> 00:32:36,946
A few days later, war was declared.

359
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,985
Jules and Jim were separated
by their uniforms...

360
00:32:40,086 --> 00:32:41,781
and lost touch for along time.

361
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:46,778
The war was never ending.

362
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:49,218
Gradually, it became
like a normal life...

363
00:33:49,322 --> 00:33:51,313
tempered by the different seasons.

364
00:33:51,424 --> 00:33:55,622
A normal life with deadbeats, routines,
pauses, and even distractions.

365
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:08,537
Gilberte sent parcels to Jim.

366
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:12,372
He almost saw her a few times,
but each time his leave was canceled.

367
00:34:14,147 --> 00:34:17,275
Then, in 1916,
he spent a week in Paris.

368
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:23,054
Don't marry me for my parcels.
We're fine as we are.

369
00:34:23,156 --> 00:34:26,091
All right,
but I know this will last.

370
00:34:26,192 --> 00:34:30,253
- How is Jules?
- No news of him since his wedding.

371
00:34:30,363 --> 00:34:33,355
Sometimes, I'm afraid
I'll kill Jules during a battle.

372
00:34:44,744 --> 00:34:46,109
My darling...

373
00:34:47,146 --> 00:34:49,171
I never stop thinking of you.

374
00:34:49,782 --> 00:34:52,717
Not of your soul.
I don't believe in it anymore.

375
00:34:53,386 --> 00:34:56,549
But of your body...

376
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,589
and our son who is inside you.

377
00:35:01,995 --> 00:35:05,897
I've no more envelopes.
I don't know how to mail this letter.

378
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,767
I am going to the Russian front.

379
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:12,872
It will be tough...

380
00:35:14,073 --> 00:35:18,533
but I prefer it because
I was afraid to kill Jim here.

381
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:21,277
My darling...

382
00:35:22,982 --> 00:35:25,314
let me kiss you.

383
00:36:24,243 --> 00:36:27,371
Jules' country lost the war.
Jim's had won.

384
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,971
But they were both victorious
since they were alive.

385
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:34,213
They began to write each other again.

386
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,948
Catherine and Jules lived
in a cottage near the Rhine.

387
00:36:37,056 --> 00:36:39,456
They had a daughter, Sabine.

388
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:44,519
Jim wrote Jules.. "Tell me,
should I marry and have children, too?"

389
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,724
Jules replied..
"Come and judge for yourself. "

390
00:36:47,834 --> 00:36:49,734
Catherine signed the invitation.

391
00:36:49,836 --> 00:36:53,431
Jim left,
but he delayed his arrival.

392
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:55,973
He walked along the Rhine,
and stopped inseveral towns.

393
00:36:56,075 --> 00:36:59,909
He was writing about Germany
after the war for a Paris paper.

394
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:04,214
He wanted to see
his battlegrounds again.

395
00:37:06,652 --> 00:37:08,916
In some places, the land
had been bombarded so heavily...

396
00:37:09,022 --> 00:37:13,288
that no thing could ever
grow on it again.

397
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,322
They became cemeteries where Jim
looked on graves for familiar names...

398
00:37:18,431 --> 00:37:21,662
cemeteries that were being shown
to schoolchildren.

399
00:37:37,383 --> 00:37:40,045
Catherine was waiting at the station
with her daughter.

400
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:43,088
Her eyes were shining with joy.

401
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:56,766
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, Catherine.

402
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:00,896
- This is Sabine.
- Hello, Mr. Jim.

403
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:04,035
Let's go.
Jules is anxious to see you.

404
00:38:04,944 --> 00:38:08,675
Her deep voice made Jim think
she had finally made their date...

405
00:38:08,781 --> 00:38:10,749
and had dressed up
especially for him.

406
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:14,877
She took him, to their cottage,
surrounded by pines and near a hill.

407
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:48,179
- How are the others?
- Oh, the others, you know.

408
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:57,423
- You haven't changed, Jim.
- You haven't changed, Jules.

409
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,225
So, no one has changed.

410
00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:14,303
Sit down.

411
00:39:16,716 --> 00:39:17,740
Come here, Sabine.

412
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:38,036
No, thanks.

413
00:39:38,704 --> 00:39:40,797
- You want some?
-Just a little.

414
00:39:46,379 --> 00:39:50,406
No, thanks. I stopped smoking
when I started to love plants.

415
00:39:58,758 --> 00:40:01,056
An angel is passing by.

416
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:08,901
Of course, it's twenty past one.

417
00:40:11,103 --> 00:40:12,263
So?

418
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:15,135
Angels always pass by
at twenty past.

419
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:21,572
- I didn't know that.
- Neither did I.

420
00:40:28,621 --> 00:40:30,646
At twenty past
and twenty to as well.

421
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:38,389
So you won the war, you louse.

422
00:40:38,497 --> 00:40:41,227
I'd rather have won this.

423
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,361
You must be hungry. Let's eat.

424
00:40:48,975 --> 00:40:51,535
Afterwards, I'll show you the house.

425
00:40:56,582 --> 00:41:00,575
Jim here, Jules over there.
And Sabine next to me.

426
00:41:04,824 --> 00:41:06,519
How is your new novel?

427
00:41:06,626 --> 00:41:09,459
These articles won't let me finish it.

428
00:41:09,562 --> 00:41:13,692
I work on them all week,
write them Friday night...

429
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:16,597
and send them airmail
the next day. And you?

430
00:41:16,702 --> 00:41:19,603
I am doing a book on dragonflies.

431
00:41:19,705 --> 00:41:22,037
I am writing it for a publisher.

432
00:41:22,141 --> 00:41:24,871
Catherine is illustrating it.

433
00:41:24,977 --> 00:41:29,937
Even Sabine helps.
She goes with me into the swamps.

434
00:41:30,283 --> 00:41:34,276
I'm going to build
a pond in the garden.

435
00:41:34,387 --> 00:41:39,324
One day, perhaps, I may become literary
and write a love story...

436
00:41:39,425 --> 00:41:43,020
with insects as characters.

437
00:41:43,896 --> 00:41:48,492
I have a bad tendency to specialize.

438
00:41:49,201 --> 00:41:52,659
I admire your versatility, Jim.

439
00:41:53,739 --> 00:41:57,937
Oh, me, I'm a failure. Sorel,
my teacher, taught me all I know.

440
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:01,041
"What do you want to do," he asked me.
I said I wanted to be a diplomat.

441
00:42:01,147 --> 00:42:03,240
"Do you have money?"
"No."

442
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:08,252
"Are you related to anyone famous?"
"No."

443
00:42:08,354 --> 00:42:12,256
"Then forget about diplomacy!"
"But what can I become?"

444
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:14,223
"Curious."
"That's no career."

445
00:42:14,327 --> 00:42:15,988
"Not yet.

446
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,355
Travel, write, translate.

447
00:42:19,465 --> 00:42:22,696
Learn to live anywhere,
beginning now.

448
00:42:22,802 --> 00:42:24,827
There's a future in it.

449
00:42:24,937 --> 00:42:27,872
The French have ignored the world
for too long.

450
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:31,142
A paper will always
pay for your fun."

451
00:42:33,946 --> 00:42:36,642
Jules thinks you have
a bright future.

452
00:42:36,749 --> 00:42:40,651
So do I,
but it may not be spectacular.

453
00:42:43,155 --> 00:42:45,817
Jules works and sleeps here.

454
00:42:45,925 --> 00:42:48,860
We're as organized as a monastery.

455
00:42:48,994 --> 00:42:50,791
Jules writes his books...

456
00:42:50,896 --> 00:42:54,354
and hunts his insects.

457
00:42:54,467 --> 00:42:57,732
Mathilde, who you saw,
comes from a nearby farm.

458
00:42:57,837 --> 00:43:00,635
She helps me
with the house and Sabine.

459
00:43:03,442 --> 00:43:04,409
My room.

460
00:43:09,248 --> 00:43:10,374
That's Jules!

461
00:43:10,483 --> 00:43:15,250
Yes, his father liked Mozart so much
that he once disguised him as Mozart.

462
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:19,114
Here is the balcony.

463
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:27,631
Over there is the inn
where you'll sleep.

464
00:43:27,733 --> 00:43:29,701
Jules will take you there later.

465
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,674
Jules and Jim
carried on their conversation.

466
00:44:45,776 --> 00:44:49,177
They talked about the war.
Jules avoided talking about his family.

467
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,372
Catherine was kind and tough...

468
00:44:51,482 --> 00:44:54,110
but Jim felt something was wrong.

469
00:45:03,494 --> 00:45:06,588
To bed, sleepyhead.

470
00:45:06,697 --> 00:45:09,222
Once upon a time...

471
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,900
there was a little sleepyhead...

472
00:45:14,471 --> 00:45:17,998
- Good night, Sabine.
- Good night, Jim. See you tomorrow.

473
00:45:20,978 --> 00:45:23,310
- Good night, Jules.
- I want to talk to you.

474
00:45:28,452 --> 00:45:32,479
- What do you think of her?
- Marriage and motherhood suit her.

475
00:45:32,589 --> 00:45:35,717
She's less of a grasshopper
and more of an ant.

476
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:40,719
Be careful.

477
00:45:41,498 --> 00:45:44,365
True, she keeps order in our home.

478
00:45:44,902 --> 00:45:48,895
But if things go too smoothly,
she changes.

479
00:45:49,473 --> 00:45:52,772
She becomes a tyrant in her words.

480
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:55,174
Yes, she has a Napoleonic side.

481
00:45:56,113 --> 00:45:58,604
She believes the world is rich...

482
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:02,048
and that one can cheat a little.

483
00:46:02,152 --> 00:46:04,848
She begs God
to forgive her in advance.

484
00:46:04,955 --> 00:46:06,217
She is sure that He will.

485
00:46:08,392 --> 00:46:10,826
I'm afraid she'll leave us.

486
00:46:11,995 --> 00:46:15,487
- Impossible!
- No, she has done it already.

487
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:19,297
It lasted 6 months.
I gave up hope.

488
00:46:19,403 --> 00:46:21,667
She's ready to do it again.

489
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,272
She's not really my wife, Jim.

490
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:27,809
She has had three lovers.

491
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:32,348
One was a fling the day before
our wedding, to bury her youth.

492
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:35,179
And one as revenge
for something I did.

493
00:46:35,285 --> 00:46:36,752
I don't know what.

494
00:46:39,156 --> 00:46:41,147
I'm not the man she needs...

495
00:46:41,258 --> 00:46:43,556
and she won't accept that.

496
00:46:44,328 --> 00:46:48,025
I'm used to her
being unfaithful to me at times...

497
00:46:48,799 --> 00:46:51,290
but I couldn't stand to see her go.

498
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:56,865
- But there's Albert.
- The singer who found the statue?

499
00:46:56,974 --> 00:47:00,432
Yes, it was he who showed it to us.

500
00:47:00,544 --> 00:47:02,068
He was wounded in the war.

501
00:47:02,179 --> 00:47:05,205
He's convalescing
in a village near here.

502
00:47:05,749 --> 00:47:09,082
Catherine encourages him
and gives him hope.

503
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,253
He has spoken about her to me.

504
00:47:13,357 --> 00:47:15,951
He wants to marry her
and take the child.

505
00:47:17,094 --> 00:47:19,392
I hold no grudge against him.

506
00:47:19,496 --> 00:47:21,726
I have nothing against him nor her.

507
00:47:22,933 --> 00:47:25,060
I am slowly renouncing her...

508
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:29,294
and all I had expected from the world.

509
00:47:29,873 --> 00:47:33,639
That's what she likes about you.
That Buddhist side of yours.

510
00:47:34,778 --> 00:47:37,338
She's usually kind and generous...

511
00:47:37,948 --> 00:47:42,146
but when she thinks
she is not appreciated...

512
00:47:42,252 --> 00:47:45,710
she becomes terrible, and suddenly
goes from one extreme to the other...

513
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:47,653
with sudden attacks.

514
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:52,226
Listen to that mole-cricket.

515
00:47:52,863 --> 00:47:55,093
It's like a mole.

516
00:47:56,934 --> 00:47:59,459
Jim could see the cottage
from his bedroom window.

517
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:03,006
Catherine was there,
a queen ready to flee.

518
00:48:03,106 --> 00:48:04,835
Jim wasn't surprised.

519
00:48:04,942 --> 00:48:07,877
He recalled Jules' mistakes
with other girls.

520
00:48:07,978 --> 00:48:10,310
Catherine, he knew, was precise.

521
00:48:10,414 --> 00:48:13,645
Jim felt sorry for Jules,
but he could not condemn her.

522
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,617
She jumped at men
the way she had jumped into the river.

523
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,813
The house was under a cloud.

524
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:21,991
Another week began.

525
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:33,765
- Time to go to bed, Sabine.
- Okay, Mommy.

526
00:48:56,126 --> 00:48:59,892
I need to speak to you later, Jim.
Will you be free?

527
00:49:07,938 --> 00:49:12,875
Words change meaning
from one language to another...

528
00:49:12,976 --> 00:49:14,568
when they change gender.

529
00:49:14,678 --> 00:49:19,638
In German, war and death are masculine,
unlike in French...

530
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:23,780
while sun and love are feminine.

531
00:49:28,959 --> 00:49:31,587
- Life is neuter.
- Life is neuter?

532
00:49:31,695 --> 00:49:34,789
Very pretty and very logical.

533
00:49:40,704 --> 00:49:43,673
Skirts became short in France, too,
during the war.

534
00:49:43,774 --> 00:49:46,436
Married soldiers hated that.

535
00:49:46,543 --> 00:49:48,841
They felt betrayed...

536
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:52,005
but it was because
the fabric was scarce.

537
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:54,447
Yes, and women
cut their hair short...

538
00:49:54,551 --> 00:49:57,349
to avoid danger in factories.

539
00:49:57,454 --> 00:50:01,686
It's time you start to
appreciate German beer, Jim.

540
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:04,955
Jim is like me! He's French.
He couldn't care less about German beer.

541
00:50:05,062 --> 00:50:06,927
- Not at all.
- What?

542
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:10,488
French wines are the best in Europe,
in the world even.

543
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,969
Look at the clarets:
Chteau Lafitte, Chteau Margaux.

544
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:21,739
That's not all. There are others.

545
00:50:21,845 --> 00:50:24,712
The burgundies: Romane, Chambertin...

546
00:50:24,815 --> 00:50:27,409
Beaume, Pommard, Chablis, Volnais.

547
00:50:27,517 --> 00:50:30,509
And Beaujolais wines:
Pouilly-Fuiss...

548
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,817
Moulin  Vent, Fleurie,
Morgon, Saint Amour.

549
00:50:33,924 --> 00:50:38,520
We stared at the shell
as it rolled down the steps.

550
00:50:38,628 --> 00:50:41,825
Three steps, two steps.
Lie down.

551
00:50:42,566 --> 00:50:43,555
Catch me.

552
00:51:09,626 --> 00:51:12,857
- What do you want to know?
- Nothing. I want to listen.

553
00:51:12,963 --> 00:51:15,989
- To judge me?
- Certainly not.

554
00:51:18,902 --> 00:51:22,394
I have nothing to tell you.
I want to question you.

555
00:51:23,273 --> 00:51:26,071
The question is:
tell me about Jim.

556
00:51:27,244 --> 00:51:32,011
- Okay, but tell you what?
- Anything, but tell me point-blank.

557
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:34,744
Jim told of two young men
which he didn't name...

558
00:51:34,851 --> 00:51:38,309
and told the story
of their friendship in Paris...

559
00:51:38,422 --> 00:51:42,188
and how they met a certain girl.

560
00:51:42,292 --> 00:51:47,059
He told of... Not that one, Jim.
There, he had to say his own name.

561
00:51:47,164 --> 00:51:49,826
He told of their friendship,
of their trip by the sea.

562
00:51:49,933 --> 00:51:53,460
Catherine saw that Jim remembered
everything about her.

563
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:56,403
She argued on a few points
and added other details.

564
00:51:56,506 --> 00:52:00,533
He described their date, told her
how he perceived all three of them.

565
00:52:00,644 --> 00:52:05,604
He said he always knew
that Jules could never keep Catherine.

566
00:52:06,516 --> 00:52:09,610
- You'd have said that in the caf?
- Yes.

567
00:52:10,454 --> 00:52:13,423
- Go on.
- That's all there is.

568
00:52:14,157 --> 00:52:15,556
There was the war...

569
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,293
my joy to see Jules again,
my seeing you at the station...

570
00:52:19,396 --> 00:52:21,694
the happy days
I've spent with you here...

571
00:52:22,566 --> 00:52:25,399
what I have seen, what I have learned,
what I have guessed...

572
00:52:25,502 --> 00:52:28,938
that pending cloud, I mean Albert.

573
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:32,975
- Are you against me?
- No more than Jules is.

574
00:52:33,844 --> 00:52:37,211
Let me tell
my side of the story now.

575
00:52:37,314 --> 00:52:41,011
Jules conquered me
with his generosity...

576
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:43,847
his innocence, and his vulnerability.

577
00:52:43,954 --> 00:52:46,422
He was such a contrast to other men.

578
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:50,487
I hoped to cure him
of his insecurities...

579
00:52:50,594 --> 00:52:53,461
but I learned
they were part of him.

580
00:52:54,064 --> 00:52:57,727
We were happy,
but our happiness did not last...

581
00:52:57,834 --> 00:53:02,794
and we became two people, not one.

582
00:53:04,608 --> 00:53:07,839
His family was torture for me.

583
00:53:07,944 --> 00:53:10,378
At a reception before our wedding...

584
00:53:10,947 --> 00:53:14,007
Jules' mother
offended me very deeply.

585
00:53:14,117 --> 00:53:16,176
Jules said nothing.

586
00:53:16,286 --> 00:53:21,246
I punished him by spending a few hours
with an old lover, Harold.

587
00:53:21,525 --> 00:53:23,186
Yes, a lover.

588
00:53:23,293 --> 00:53:27,787
So I was able to marry Jules
with all accounts squared.

589
00:53:28,999 --> 00:53:31,991
Luckily, his family moved away.

590
00:53:32,702 --> 00:53:36,194
The war broke out.
Jules went to the Russian front.

591
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,908
He wrote me love letters,
wonderful letters.

592
00:53:41,578 --> 00:53:44,570
I loved him more at a distance.
He became a saint again.

593
00:53:44,681 --> 00:53:48,276
Things really went wrong
during his first leave.

594
00:53:48,385 --> 00:53:50,910
I felt as if I was
in the arms of a stranger.

595
00:53:51,021 --> 00:53:53,922
He left: Sabine was born
nine months later.

596
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:55,514
She doesn't look very much like Jules.

597
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:57,889
Believe what you want,
but she's his.

598
00:53:57,994 --> 00:54:01,327
I said, "I've given you a child.
That's enough.

599
00:54:01,431 --> 00:54:04,958
I want my own bedroom.
I want my own freedom."

600
00:54:05,068 --> 00:54:07,536
Remember our friend, Fortunio?

601
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:11,272
He was free. So was I.

602
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:14,775
He was a sweet partner.
What a vacation.

603
00:54:14,878 --> 00:54:18,041
But he was too young to be serious.

604
00:54:18,848 --> 00:54:20,645
One day, to my surprise...

605
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:24,979
I missed Jules and his indulgence.

606
00:54:25,088 --> 00:54:28,148
My daughter attracted me
like a magnet.

607
00:54:28,258 --> 00:54:29,691
I left.

608
00:54:30,293 --> 00:54:32,318
I've been back for three months.

609
00:54:34,864 --> 00:54:37,765
Jules is no longer my husband.

610
00:54:37,867 --> 00:54:42,327
Don't feel sorry for him.
My presence alone satisfies him.

611
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,267
Then there is Albert.

612
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:49,436
He told me of that statue you loved
which resembles me.

613
00:54:49,546 --> 00:54:51,013
I flirted with him.

614
00:54:51,114 --> 00:54:54,845
He can be strange, but he has
a natural strength that Jules doesn't.

615
00:54:54,951 --> 00:54:58,785
He wants to leave everything,
marry me and take me and my daughter.

616
00:54:58,888 --> 00:55:01,288
So far, I like him. That's all.

617
00:55:01,391 --> 00:55:04,258
He's coming to lunch tomorrow.
I'll see.

618
00:55:04,361 --> 00:55:07,023
I talked more than you did.

619
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:10,031
I didn't say everything.
Neither did you.

620
00:55:10,133 --> 00:55:12,294
Perhaps I've had other men.
That's my business.

621
00:55:12,402 --> 00:55:15,132
I spoke only of what you mentioned.

622
00:55:15,238 --> 00:55:17,798
- I understand.
- I don't want you to.

623
00:55:18,408 --> 00:55:20,239
It's almost dawn.

624
00:55:20,977 --> 00:55:24,538
Jim desired her,
but he kept repressing that desire.

625
00:55:24,648 --> 00:55:28,516
She had to stay.
Was Jim acting for Jules?

626
00:55:28,618 --> 00:55:31,587
Or for himself?.
He would never know.

627
00:55:39,796 --> 00:55:42,230
Perhaps she was seducing him,
although Jim was unsure.

628
00:55:42,332 --> 00:55:47,292
But she revealed her goals
only when she achieved them.

629
00:55:59,716 --> 00:56:01,616
- Hello, Sabine.
- Hello, Albert.

630
00:56:01,718 --> 00:56:05,279
- How are you? How is your mother?
- Fine.

631
00:56:13,396 --> 00:56:14,795
Hello, Albert.

632
00:56:16,966 --> 00:56:20,458
- You sacrificed your moustache?
- Yes, everyone did.

633
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:22,868
But I don't like it.
Now I feel naked.

634
00:56:22,972 --> 00:56:24,564
I'll let it grow back.

635
00:56:24,674 --> 00:56:27,040
Albert was wounded...

636
00:56:27,143 --> 00:56:28,542
in the trenches.

637
00:56:28,645 --> 00:56:30,875
I'm all right now,
but when I woke up...

638
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:34,677
and saw the doctors probing inside
my skull, I thought of Oscar Wilde.

639
00:56:34,784 --> 00:56:36,945
God, spare me physical pain.

640
00:56:37,053 --> 00:56:39,283
I'll take care of the moral pain.

641
00:56:39,389 --> 00:56:41,516
What's revolting about war...

642
00:56:41,624 --> 00:56:44,889
is that it deprives man
of his own individual battle.

643
00:56:44,994 --> 00:56:49,488
Yes, but even in the midst of war,
he can fight it.

644
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,091
I knew a soldier in the hospital.

645
00:56:53,203 --> 00:56:56,661
On leave, he met a girl on a train.

646
00:56:56,773 --> 00:56:59,037
They talked between Nice and Marseilles.

647
00:56:59,142 --> 00:57:02,043
She left and gave him her address.

648
00:57:02,145 --> 00:57:06,241
Well, he wrote her every day
for two years from the trenches...

649
00:57:06,349 --> 00:57:08,579
by candlelight, during battles.

650
00:57:08,685 --> 00:57:11,552
His letters became more intimate.

651
00:57:11,654 --> 00:57:16,353
At first, he wrote: "Dear Miss,"
and ended with, "Yours truly."

652
00:57:16,459 --> 00:57:20,020
Soon he called her "My little lamb"
and asked for her picture.

653
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:23,497
Then she became "My adorable lamb."
First: "I kiss your hand."

654
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,364
Then: "Your forehead."

655
00:57:26,469 --> 00:57:29,233
She sent him a picture...

656
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:32,399
and he wrote that he could see
her breasts through her robe.

657
00:57:32,509 --> 00:57:36,172
He became more blunt.
"I love you terribly."

658
00:57:36,279 --> 00:57:40,045
He wrote to her mother
and proposed marriage.

659
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:44,246
He became her fianc
without having seen her again.

660
00:57:44,354 --> 00:57:48,256
As the war continued,
his letters became more intimate.

661
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:52,590
"I take you, my love.
I hold your adorable breasts.

662
00:57:52,695 --> 00:57:55,528
I hold you naked against my body."

663
00:57:55,632 --> 00:57:59,659
She wrote a cold letter,
and he begged her to be serious...

664
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:02,567
for he could die at any time,
and he was right.

665
00:58:02,672 --> 00:58:07,302
This mad affair
by correspondence could exist...

666
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:10,277
only in the violence
of trench warfare...

667
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:13,781
with death always nearby.

668
00:58:14,918 --> 00:58:17,887
So this man fought the war...

669
00:58:17,987 --> 00:58:21,479
but he fought
his own battle as well...

670
00:58:21,591 --> 00:58:24,856
and he won a woman by mail.

671
00:58:26,129 --> 00:58:29,098
He had a head wound, too,
when he arrived at the hospital...

672
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:31,167
but he was less lucky.

673
00:58:31,267 --> 00:58:34,600
He died the day
before the Armistice.

674
00:58:35,705 --> 00:58:38,606
In his last letter, he wrote her...

675
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:41,677
"Your breasts are
the only bombs I've loved."

676
00:58:41,778 --> 00:58:44,338
I'll show you some photos of him.

677
00:58:44,447 --> 00:58:46,540
If you flip through them quickly,
he seems to be moving.

678
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:48,139
Pretty story.

679
00:58:48,251 --> 00:58:51,084
Jules wrote me
beautiful letters too.

680
00:58:52,188 --> 00:58:54,816
Hello, Albert.
Have you finished my song?

681
00:58:54,924 --> 00:58:57,825
Let's go upstairs
and work on it together.

682
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:24,918
A rocking chair
has a rhythm of its own.

683
00:59:26,122 --> 00:59:29,285
- What about the song?
- It's almost ready.

684
00:59:29,392 --> 00:59:32,054
Yes. Let's go.

685
00:59:38,968 --> 00:59:41,266
It's too good for them...

686
00:59:41,371 --> 00:59:43,566
but we've no other audience.

687
00:59:48,778 --> 00:59:51,713
She wore rings on every finger

688
00:59:51,814 --> 00:59:54,408
More bracelets than I can tell

689
00:59:54,517 --> 00:59:57,077
And she was the kind of singer

690
00:59:57,186 --> 00:59:59,984
To put me under a spell

691
01:00:00,089 --> 01:00:02,887
She had eyes, eyes of opal

692
01:00:02,992 --> 01:00:05,358
They fascinated me

693
01:00:05,461 --> 01:00:07,793
Her pale face was an oval

694
01:00:07,897 --> 01:00:09,956
What a fatal femme fatale

695
01:00:13,303 --> 01:00:15,533
We met with a kiss

696
01:00:15,638 --> 01:00:17,902
A hit then a miss

697
01:00:18,007 --> 01:00:20,237
It wasn't all bliss

698
01:00:20,343 --> 01:00:22,777
And we parted

699
01:00:22,879 --> 01:00:25,211
We went our own ways

700
01:00:25,315 --> 01:00:27,613
In life's whirlpool of days

701
01:00:27,717 --> 01:00:30,083
I saw her again one night

702
01:00:30,186 --> 01:00:32,654
Again she was an enchanted sight

703
01:00:35,925 --> 01:00:38,587
I recognized her after a while

704
01:00:38,695 --> 01:00:40,959
By her mysterious smile

705
01:00:41,064 --> 01:00:43,328
Her face in an oval
Her eyes of opal

706
01:00:43,433 --> 01:00:45,799
Affected me more than ever

707
01:00:45,902 --> 01:00:48,234
I drank as I heard her sing

708
01:00:48,338 --> 01:00:50,636
Alcohol lets time lose its sting

709
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:53,004
I drank far too much

710
01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:55,600
I awoke to her touch

711
01:00:58,448 --> 01:01:01,110
We met with a kiss

712
01:01:01,217 --> 01:01:03,344
A hit, then a miss

713
01:01:03,453 --> 01:01:05,683
It wasn't all bliss

714
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:08,154
But we started

715
01:01:08,257 --> 01:01:10,589
We went our own ways

716
01:01:10,693 --> 01:01:12,888
In life's whirlpool of days

717
01:01:12,996 --> 01:01:15,226
Again I saw her one night

718
01:01:15,331 --> 01:01:17,799
Again her smile was a light

719
01:01:21,371 --> 01:01:23,339
When you kiss

720
01:01:23,439 --> 01:01:25,532
Why miss

721
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:27,632
When you return

722
01:01:27,744 --> 01:01:30,212
Why be stern

723
01:01:30,313 --> 01:01:32,508
Together, we make our ways

724
01:01:32,615 --> 01:01:34,742
In life's whirlpool of days

725
01:01:34,851 --> 01:01:37,081
We go round and round

726
01:01:37,186 --> 01:01:41,885
Together bound
Together bound

727
01:01:48,898 --> 01:01:53,528
Each saw her in his own light.
She couldn't please them all.

728
01:01:53,636 --> 01:01:57,299
Jim could only admire
Catherine alone.

729
01:01:57,407 --> 01:01:59,898
He felt he was in the way.

730
01:02:16,292 --> 01:02:18,192
- Good night.
- Good night.

731
01:02:19,529 --> 01:02:23,693
Our affection is new. We should
let it rest like a newborn baby.

732
01:02:24,834 --> 01:02:28,292
You were in love, Jim.
I can feel that.

733
01:02:28,404 --> 01:02:31,271
- Why didn't you marry her?
- It didn't work out.

734
01:02:31,374 --> 01:02:34,070
- What is she like?
- Quiet and patient.

735
01:02:34,177 --> 01:02:37,305
Gilberte says she'll wait
for me forever.

736
01:02:37,413 --> 01:02:39,381
You still love her,
and she loves you?

737
01:02:40,783 --> 01:02:45,743
- Don't make her suffer.
- I need adventures and risks.

738
01:02:47,123 --> 01:02:49,717
There's been a change too.

739
01:02:53,396 --> 01:02:57,059
I admire you.
I enjoy seeing you.

740
01:02:57,166 --> 01:03:00,431
- I'm afraid I'll forget Jules.
- You must not forget him.

741
01:03:00,536 --> 01:03:01,935
Warn him.

742
01:03:10,313 --> 01:03:11,803
Translate that!

743
01:03:11,914 --> 01:03:16,351
The yearnings of two hearts
create such heavenly pain.

744
01:03:16,452 --> 01:03:18,943
Not bad.

745
01:03:19,055 --> 01:03:23,185
Though you added the heavenly.
Good night.

746
01:03:23,292 --> 01:03:25,988
Give my regards to the others.

747
01:03:26,095 --> 01:03:29,223
I'd like to read Goethe tonight.
May I have it?

748
01:03:29,332 --> 01:03:32,529
- I lent it to Jim.
- Too bad.

749
01:03:33,636 --> 01:03:36,230
- Good night, Jim.
- Good night.

750
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,274
I'll bring it tomorrow.

751
01:03:56,425 --> 01:03:58,950
You must bring it now.

752
01:03:59,061 --> 01:04:01,222
She insists on reading it tonight.

753
01:04:02,498 --> 01:04:05,467
Jim, she doesn't want me anymore.

754
01:04:06,669 --> 01:04:10,105
I'm afraid she will disappear
from my life.

755
01:04:10,206 --> 01:04:13,300
The last time I saw you with her...

756
01:04:13,409 --> 01:04:15,673
you looked like a couple.

757
01:04:15,778 --> 01:04:17,905
Love her, marry her...

758
01:04:18,014 --> 01:04:20,039
and let me see her.

759
01:04:20,149 --> 01:04:23,607
I mean, if you love her,
don't think I'm an obstacle.

760
01:05:38,127 --> 01:05:40,425
Jim had waited for her all day.

761
01:05:40,529 --> 01:05:42,895
She came into his arms gravely.

762
01:05:43,766 --> 01:05:46,291
Their first kiss lasted all night.

763
01:05:46,402 --> 01:05:48,768
They were silent
as they drew close.

764
01:05:48,871 --> 01:05:50,805
Later, they remained silent.

765
01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:54,342
Her face expressed
strange joy and curiosity.

766
01:05:54,443 --> 01:05:56,343
Jim was prisoner.

767
01:05:56,445 --> 01:05:58,675
No other woman existed for him.

768
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:04,317
Your turn.

769
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:27,937
I've asked Jim
to move into the house.

770
01:06:28,044 --> 01:06:30,103
He'll take the small room.

771
01:06:35,651 --> 01:06:37,710
Careful, Jim.

772
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:40,789
Be careful for both of you.

773
01:07:12,021 --> 01:07:13,921
This is your room.

774
01:07:15,024 --> 01:07:19,154
The books are in German,
but I've got others in my room.

775
01:07:21,564 --> 01:07:24,727
I'll unpack your bag.
I think it will do.

776
01:07:25,835 --> 01:07:28,895
The rest is a mess...

777
01:07:29,004 --> 01:07:30,938
but we can't help that.

778
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:35,773
- What is on the other side?
- Sabine and Mathilde's room.

779
01:07:42,351 --> 01:07:44,717
The bed isn't too bad.

780
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:47,015
Sit down next to me.

781
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,890
I've always liked
the nape of your neck.

782
01:07:53,996 --> 01:07:57,659
That was the only part of you
I could look at without being seen.

783
01:08:25,361 --> 01:08:27,124
What about Jules?

784
01:08:27,229 --> 01:08:29,197
He loves us both.

785
01:08:29,298 --> 01:08:33,496
This won't surprise him.
He won't suffer.

786
01:08:33,602 --> 01:08:36,594
We shall love him and respect him.

787
01:08:39,575 --> 01:08:43,102
In the village they were
known as the three lunatics...

788
01:08:43,212 --> 01:08:45,146
but they were accepted.

789
01:08:45,247 --> 01:08:48,307
When she found that out, Catherine
invented a game.. the village idiot.

790
01:08:48,417 --> 01:08:51,750
The village was the table.
They took turns as the idiot.

791
01:08:51,854 --> 01:08:54,322
Sabine made them laugh.

792
01:09:26,689 --> 01:09:29,920
Catherine believed
that love was short...

793
01:09:30,025 --> 01:09:32,585
but constantly recurring.

794
01:09:32,695 --> 01:09:34,754
Life was a vacation
for all of them.

795
01:09:34,864 --> 01:09:38,231
Jules and Jim
had never lived so intensely.

796
01:09:38,334 --> 01:09:40,302
Time went by.

797
01:09:40,402 --> 01:09:43,462
Happiness can't be told, but
it wears off without anyone noticing it.

798
01:09:45,241 --> 01:09:47,641
One day, she decided
to seduce Jules.

799
01:09:47,743 --> 01:09:49,734
While Jim was reading downstairs...

800
01:09:49,845 --> 01:09:52,075
she took Jules into her room.

801
01:09:52,181 --> 01:09:55,412
Jules said no,
but Catherine said yes.

802
01:10:22,244 --> 01:10:26,510
Jim said he wasn't jealous,
but he was.

803
01:10:26,615 --> 01:10:30,415
She saw this and never
repeated the experiment.

804
01:10:31,887 --> 01:10:34,117
One day, they walked around a lake...

805
01:10:34,223 --> 01:10:37,420
hidden in the mist of a green valley.

806
01:10:37,526 --> 01:10:39,585
The harmony between them was perfect.

807
01:10:39,695 --> 01:10:43,461
Catherine had a headache,
so did Jim.

808
01:10:43,566 --> 01:10:46,694
If they had children, he thought,
they would be tall...

809
01:10:46,802 --> 01:10:49,168
thin and have headaches too.

810
01:10:49,271 --> 01:10:51,671
They played on the shore
Of the lake.

811
01:10:51,774 --> 01:10:55,938
She made him throw stones. She and
Jules learned how to skip stones.

812
01:10:57,046 --> 01:10:59,037
The sky was so close to them.

813
01:11:10,292 --> 01:11:12,726
Jim had to return to Paris.

814
01:11:12,828 --> 01:11:14,728
His paper needed him.

815
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:18,266
But they knew he would return...

816
01:11:18,367 --> 01:11:20,267
and things would remain the same.

817
01:11:20,369 --> 01:11:24,362
Their perfect month
was engraved into them.

818
01:11:26,008 --> 01:11:28,841
They waved at each other as he left.

819
01:11:28,944 --> 01:11:33,472
Jules gave them his blessings
And promised to take care of her...

820
01:11:33,582 --> 01:11:36,073
for they wanted to marry.

821
01:11:44,693 --> 01:11:47,253
Jules is willing to divorce.

822
01:11:47,363 --> 01:11:49,729
I'm going to marry Catherine.

823
01:11:49,832 --> 01:11:52,392
I want to have children with her.

824
01:11:52,501 --> 01:11:55,129
Jules will find me work
in his country.

825
01:11:55,237 --> 01:11:59,367
Right now, I'm translating
an Austrian play.

826
01:12:01,677 --> 01:12:03,577
Where are you going?

827
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:05,613
- Home.
- I'll go with you.

828
01:12:05,714 --> 01:12:08,239
I'd rather you didn't.

829
01:12:13,422 --> 01:12:15,356
Hello, Jim.

830
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:18,790
It's me, Therese.
The steam engine.

831
01:12:18,894 --> 01:12:21,488
Therese, how are you?
How is...

832
01:12:21,597 --> 01:12:24,157
It lasted two weeks.
I cheated on him.

833
01:12:24,266 --> 01:12:27,429
He found out, got jealous,
stopped trusting me.

834
01:12:27,536 --> 01:12:30,027
He locked me up for three weeks.

835
01:12:30,139 --> 01:12:32,573
I was flattered, then furious.

836
01:12:32,675 --> 01:12:34,973
I got out on a painter's ladder
with the painter.

837
01:12:35,077 --> 01:12:37,637
I got impatient.
A guy wants to make me rich.

838
01:12:37,746 --> 01:12:40,647
I follow him to Cairo
where he puts me up in a house.

839
01:12:43,786 --> 01:12:46,152
An Englishman rescues me.

840
01:12:46,255 --> 01:12:49,952
I move into his villa by the Red Sea,
play tennis, ride horses.

841
01:12:50,059 --> 01:12:52,619
Then I get a letter.

842
01:12:52,728 --> 01:12:55,356
- Hello, is Jules in Paris?
- No, he didn't come.

843
01:12:55,464 --> 01:12:59,298
I go to wreck the wedding.
I marry him.

844
01:12:59,401 --> 01:13:02,393
Hello, Jim. How is your buddy?

845
01:13:02,504 --> 01:13:05,769
- Still with the same girl?
- Always.

846
01:13:05,874 --> 01:13:08,775
He was serious.
He thought I wasn't.

847
01:13:08,877 --> 01:13:11,402
My husband divorced me finally.

848
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:13,743
My undertaker married me.

849
01:13:13,849 --> 01:13:15,976
It's a perfect marriage,
but no children.

850
01:13:16,085 --> 01:13:20,647
I've neither time nor energy
to be unfaithful.

851
01:13:20,756 --> 01:13:24,886
So I'm writing my memoirs for
the Sunday Times Magazine in Europe.

852
01:13:24,993 --> 01:13:27,223
My husband.

853
01:13:29,631 --> 01:13:31,792
- What about you, Jim?
- I'm getting married.

854
01:13:41,276 --> 01:13:44,211
- How's Jules?
- All right.

855
01:13:46,648 --> 01:13:50,140
Interesting, isn't she?
Her name is Denise.

856
01:13:50,252 --> 01:13:52,652
She won't talk to you.

857
01:13:52,755 --> 01:13:55,622
She never talks.
She's not stupid.

858
01:13:55,724 --> 01:13:59,353
She's empty.
It's all empty in there.

859
01:13:59,461 --> 01:14:02,021
- She's a thing.
- Pretty thing.

860
01:14:02,131 --> 01:14:05,032
Yes, beautiful. It's just sex.

861
01:14:05,134 --> 01:14:07,034
Pure sex.

862
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:11,835
- Say good-bye, Denise.
- Sir.

863
01:14:16,612 --> 01:14:19,274
Catherine spent the winter at home
in front of the fireplace.

864
01:14:19,381 --> 01:14:21,941
She was Jim's fiance,
on loan to Jules.

865
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:23,950
Every day she asked Jules...

866
01:14:24,052 --> 01:14:26,020
"Do you think Jim loves me?"

867
01:14:27,923 --> 01:14:30,323
Listen to me, Gilberte.

868
01:14:30,425 --> 01:14:33,258
If Catherine wants something...

869
01:14:33,362 --> 01:14:36,229
and she thinks
no one will be hurt...

870
01:14:36,331 --> 01:14:38,959
she may be wrong,
but she'll do it...

871
01:14:39,067 --> 01:14:41,535
to learn from the experience.

872
01:14:41,637 --> 01:14:44,470
It's her way of achieving wisdom.

873
01:14:44,573 --> 01:14:46,666
That can last a long time.

874
01:14:46,775 --> 01:14:48,675
Don't be mean.

875
01:14:49,778 --> 01:14:52,406
I'm not mean. I'm jealous.

876
01:14:54,183 --> 01:14:57,050
I knew it would end this way.

877
01:14:59,121 --> 01:15:01,487
Don't leave tomorrow.

878
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:04,889
You'll give her your life,
so just give me one more week.

879
01:15:05,994 --> 01:15:09,293
Jim couldn't leave Gilberte.
Catherine couldn't leave Jules.

880
01:15:09,398 --> 01:15:11,866
They couldn't hurt
Jules or Gilberte...

881
01:15:11,967 --> 01:15:15,528
who be longed to the past
and who each played the same role.

882
01:15:15,637 --> 01:15:19,869
"Tell Jules I saw Therese.
She's married and is writing.

883
01:15:19,975 --> 01:15:22,170
I have to delay
my trip back once again...

884
01:15:22,277 --> 01:15:24,837
but soon I'll be free,
ready for you.

885
01:15:24,947 --> 01:15:27,939
I must still say a few good-byes.

886
01:15:29,251 --> 01:15:31,481
A few good-byes."

887
01:15:34,489 --> 01:15:36,514
Do you think Jim loves me?

888
01:15:40,829 --> 01:15:43,889
- Hello, Jules.
- Hello.

889
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,796
What's wrong?

890
01:15:45,901 --> 01:15:48,734
Why didn't Catherine
come to meet me?

891
01:15:48,837 --> 01:15:53,001
She disliked your letters. You talked
about your work, your good-byes.

892
01:15:53,108 --> 01:15:56,566
She didn't like your absence.
You were gone too long.

893
01:15:56,678 --> 01:15:59,476
When she is in doubt,
she can do anything.

894
01:15:59,581 --> 01:16:03,278
- Is she waiting for us?
- Yes, I think so.

895
01:16:32,514 --> 01:16:34,914
I didn't want to tell you.

896
01:16:35,017 --> 01:16:38,646
She left yesterday morning
without saying a word.

897
01:16:38,754 --> 01:16:42,383
I had hoped that she would
be back before your arrival.

898
01:16:42,491 --> 01:16:44,482
Aren't you worried?

899
01:16:44,593 --> 01:16:47,824
You mean, is she in danger?

900
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:54,892
She is merely doing
something irreparable.

901
01:16:56,004 --> 01:16:59,201
I told you,
she disliked your letters.

902
01:16:59,308 --> 01:17:01,799
"Therese is married
and has become a writer.

903
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:03,878
I must say a few good-byes."

904
01:17:05,047 --> 01:17:09,643
No, Catherine never
does anything halfway.

905
01:17:09,751 --> 01:17:13,687
She's an irresistible force
that can't be stopped.

906
01:17:13,789 --> 01:17:16,758
Her harmony is never
shaken because...

907
01:17:16,858 --> 01:17:19,383
she knows she is always innocent.

908
01:17:19,494 --> 01:17:23,123
-You speak of her as if she was a queen.
-She is a queen.

909
01:17:23,999 --> 01:17:26,194
Let me be frank.

910
01:17:26,301 --> 01:17:30,237
She's not especially beautiful
or intelligent or sincere...

911
01:17:30,339 --> 01:17:32,307
but she is a real woman.

912
01:17:32,407 --> 01:17:34,534
And that is why we love her...

913
01:17:34,643 --> 01:17:36,907
and all men desire her.

914
01:17:38,981 --> 01:17:42,348
Despite this,
why did she make us a gift...

915
01:17:42,451 --> 01:17:44,578
of her presence?

916
01:17:44,686 --> 01:17:48,486
Because we treated her
like a queen.

917
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:51,559
You know, I almost stayed in Paris.

918
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:54,458
I knew it could never last.

919
01:17:55,564 --> 01:17:58,556
Even our friendship suffers.

920
01:17:58,667 --> 01:18:01,431
At times, I'm jealous
of your years with her.

921
01:18:01,536 --> 01:18:04,266
And I hate you
for not being jealous of me.

922
01:18:04,373 --> 01:18:06,568
Do you believe that?

923
01:18:06,675 --> 01:18:10,975
I'll do anything
not to lose her completely.

924
01:18:11,079 --> 01:18:13,343
You will, too, when she returns...

925
01:18:13,448 --> 01:18:15,382
for she always returns.

926
01:18:15,484 --> 01:18:18,920
Listen, I'm going back to Paris.

927
01:18:19,021 --> 01:18:22,013
Tell her you didn't see me
at the station.

928
01:18:22,124 --> 01:18:24,422
It's the only solution.

929
01:18:26,895 --> 01:18:31,457
I see. I met the train,
but you weren't on it.

930
01:18:40,409 --> 01:18:43,776
Hello. What's the matter?

931
01:18:50,252 --> 01:18:52,152
You've just arrived.

932
01:18:54,022 --> 01:18:57,719
You're mine and I'm yours.
All is well.

933
01:18:57,826 --> 01:19:00,386
But in your letters,
you said you had things to do.

934
01:19:00,495 --> 01:19:04,022
So did I.
You said good-bye to your loves.

935
01:19:04,132 --> 01:19:06,896
I decided to say good-bye to mine.

936
01:19:07,002 --> 01:19:10,961
You'll hold me in your arms
all night long, but that's all.

937
01:19:11,073 --> 01:19:14,201
We want a child, don't we?

938
01:19:14,309 --> 01:19:18,439
Well, if I had one now,
I wouldn't know if it was yours.

939
01:19:18,547 --> 01:19:20,447
Do you understand?

940
01:19:21,583 --> 01:19:24,677
- I had to do it.
- Do you love Albert?

941
01:19:24,786 --> 01:19:27,254
- No.
- Does he love you?

942
01:19:27,355 --> 01:19:33,089
Yes. You must believe me.
It was your only chance.

943
01:19:33,195 --> 01:19:36,130
Albert equals Gilberte.

944
01:19:36,231 --> 01:19:38,358
You don't say anything?

945
01:19:38,467 --> 01:19:40,799
We must start with a clean slate.

946
01:19:40,902 --> 01:19:45,202
A clean slate and no debts.
That was her creed.

947
01:19:45,307 --> 01:19:47,798
And nothing happened.

948
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:51,037
She slept,
but Jim's eyes remained open.

949
01:19:51,146 --> 01:19:55,242
He realized that they were
being drawn together.

950
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:58,911
So they started all over again,
flying high like birds of prey.

951
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:03,582
They restrained until she was sure
she didn't bear Albert's child.

952
01:20:03,692 --> 01:20:07,458
This restraint exalted them.
They were always together.

953
01:20:07,562 --> 01:20:10,224
They never cheated.
The promised land was in view.

954
01:20:14,169 --> 01:20:16,501
And The Promised Land Faded

955
01:20:16,605 --> 01:20:21,372
They realized that Catherine
was not pregnant with their child.

956
01:20:21,476 --> 01:20:24,172
They saw a specialist who told them
that this was not uncommon...

957
01:20:24,279 --> 01:20:26,770
and that these things took time
with most couples.

958
01:20:34,055 --> 01:20:35,955
What's wrong?

959
01:20:36,057 --> 01:20:38,252
I want to sleep alone tonight.
Go to your room.

960
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,885
- Why?
- I just want to.

961
01:20:40,996 --> 01:20:43,794
- Explain.
- There's nothing to explain.

962
01:20:43,899 --> 01:20:46,424
I'll just stay with you.
That's all.

963
01:20:46,535 --> 01:20:48,469
That's not true.

964
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:51,971
I don't want you to stay.
I'm disgusted.

965
01:20:52,073 --> 01:20:54,007
It's a nightmare
when the night comes.

966
01:20:54,109 --> 01:20:57,442
When I think of that child we will
never have, I feel I'm taking a test.

967
01:20:57,546 --> 01:21:01,107
- I can't stand it.
- Our love is all that counts.

968
01:21:01,216 --> 01:21:03,684
No, because I count too...

969
01:21:03,785 --> 01:21:06,083
and I love you less.

970
01:21:06,188 --> 01:21:08,748
Let's stay away from each other.

971
01:21:08,857 --> 01:21:12,452
I may still love you,
but I'll run that risk.

972
01:21:12,561 --> 01:21:16,258
Go to Gilberte
since she writes you every day.

973
01:21:16,364 --> 01:21:21,233
- You are not fair.
- I know, but I'm heartless.

974
01:21:21,336 --> 01:21:25,397
That's why I don't love you
and why I'll never love anyone.

975
01:21:25,507 --> 01:21:27,998
Besides, I'm 32, and you are 29.

976
01:21:28,109 --> 01:21:32,011
When I'm 40,
you'll want a girl of25...

977
01:21:32,113 --> 01:21:34,911
and I'll be left alone
like a fool.

978
01:21:36,251 --> 01:21:40,051
You may be right.
I'll leave for three months.

979
01:21:41,756 --> 01:21:43,986
Are you hurt?

980
01:21:44,092 --> 01:21:46,253
I'm not anymore.

981
01:21:46,361 --> 01:21:48,829
We should never be hurt
both at once.

982
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:52,263
When you stop suffering,
I'll start.

983
01:21:59,074 --> 01:22:01,099
Am I disturbing you?

984
01:22:07,682 --> 01:22:09,877
I can't stand it.

985
01:22:09,985 --> 01:22:14,183
- Did you hear us arguing?
- No, I was working.

986
01:22:14,289 --> 01:22:17,656
I can't stand him.
I'm going mad.

987
01:22:17,759 --> 01:22:20,455
I'm glad he's going tomorrow.
Good riddance.

988
01:22:20,562 --> 01:22:22,962
Don't be unfair.

989
01:22:23,064 --> 01:22:24,998
You know he loves you.

990
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:28,501
I really don't know anymore.

991
01:22:29,704 --> 01:22:31,604
He lied to me.

992
01:22:31,706 --> 01:22:35,073
He didn't drop Gilberte. He doesn't
even know what he wants himself.

993
01:22:35,176 --> 01:22:39,135
I love her. I don't love her,
but I will, maybe.

994
01:22:40,582 --> 01:22:43,813
I can't help it
if we didn't have a child.

995
01:22:43,918 --> 01:22:47,410
- Got a cigarette?
- You want one?

996
01:22:58,733 --> 01:23:02,169
- Want me to talk to him?
- No, please don't.

997
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:05,137
I'm half for him
and half against him.

998
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,708
But I want him to go.

999
01:23:07,809 --> 01:23:11,006
We've decided to separate
for three months.

1000
01:23:11,112 --> 01:23:13,046
What do you think?

1001
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:17,141
I don't know.
It may be a good idea.

1002
01:23:17,252 --> 01:23:19,584
You won't say what you think.

1003
01:23:20,689 --> 01:23:22,589
I know you despise me.

1004
01:23:24,659 --> 01:23:28,527
No, I shall never despise you.

1005
01:23:31,666 --> 01:23:33,827
I shall always love you...

1006
01:23:33,935 --> 01:23:37,029
no matter what you do,
no matter what happens.

1007
01:23:37,939 --> 01:23:39,839
Is that true?

1008
01:23:43,712 --> 01:23:45,839
I love you too.

1009
01:23:49,851 --> 01:23:52,843
We were happy, weren't we?

1010
01:23:52,954 --> 01:23:54,922
But we are happy.

1011
01:23:55,023 --> 01:23:58,686
I mean, I am.

1012
01:23:58,793 --> 01:24:00,818
Is that true?

1013
01:24:02,297 --> 01:24:05,994
Yes, let's always stay together...

1014
01:24:07,102 --> 01:24:10,071
like an old couple,
with Sabine...

1015
01:24:10,171 --> 01:24:12,503
and our grandchildren.

1016
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:20,514
Stay near me.

1017
01:24:21,816 --> 01:24:25,252
I don't want to see him
before he goes.

1018
01:24:25,353 --> 01:24:27,787
Then stay here.

1019
01:24:27,889 --> 01:24:30,551
I'll sleep downstairs.

1020
01:24:46,207 --> 01:24:48,141
My little Catherine.

1021
01:24:49,411 --> 01:24:51,845
Often you remind me...

1022
01:24:52,981 --> 01:24:57,008
of a Chinese play I saw
before the war.

1023
01:24:57,118 --> 01:24:59,951
The curtain rises
and the emperor...

1024
01:25:00,054 --> 01:25:03,182
turns to the audience and says...

1025
01:25:04,492 --> 01:25:07,757
"I am the unhappiest man on Earth...

1026
01:25:07,862 --> 01:25:10,296
because I have two wives.

1027
01:25:10,398 --> 01:25:13,925
My first wife and my second wife."

1028
01:25:39,594 --> 01:25:43,724
Their love was now relative,
but to Jules it was absolute.

1029
01:25:45,567 --> 01:25:47,626
The next morning
Jim left the house.

1030
01:25:47,735 --> 01:25:50,226
Catherine took him to the station.

1031
01:25:50,338 --> 01:25:52,932
A mist settled over the valley.

1032
01:25:53,041 --> 01:25:57,068
The hive felt that Jim
has lost favor with its queen.

1033
01:25:57,178 --> 01:25:59,078
He had to go.

1034
01:26:26,274 --> 01:26:28,606
We can't see the house.

1035
01:26:36,284 --> 01:26:39,117
The railway schedule had been changed.

1036
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:41,415
The train left the next day.

1037
01:26:48,997 --> 01:26:51,932
One always feels guilty
in a hotel room.

1038
01:26:52,033 --> 01:26:55,969
I'm not very moral,
but I dislike it.

1039
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:58,971
Don't tell me you don't.
I wouldn't believe you.

1040
01:27:10,552 --> 01:27:13,419
Jim thought of their children.

1041
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:16,581
He imagined a houseful
of beautiful children.

1042
01:27:16,691 --> 01:27:19,353
He knew that if they had none...

1043
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:21,394
Catherine would have affairs again.

1044
01:27:22,497 --> 01:27:25,398
They were silent in the gloomy
hotel room, but they made love.

1045
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:29,596
They didn't know why. Maybe
it was their way to end their story.

1046
01:27:29,704 --> 01:27:33,731
It was like a funeral
and as if they were already dead.

1047
01:27:52,927 --> 01:27:57,227
The next day she took him
to his train, but they did not wave.

1048
01:27:57,332 --> 01:28:00,893
They separated,
though nothing forced them.

1049
01:28:01,002 --> 01:28:04,301
It's all over now,
Jim told himself once again.

1050
01:28:25,493 --> 01:28:29,725
- Your medicine and a letter.
- Thanks.

1051
01:28:34,435 --> 01:28:37,666
I think I'm pregnant.
Come. Catherine.

1052
01:28:37,772 --> 01:28:40,673
Gilberte, please give me
some writing paper.

1053
01:28:40,775 --> 01:28:43,835
Catherine, I am in bed
and very ill.

1054
01:28:43,945 --> 01:28:47,005
Besides, I doubt
that your child is mine.

1055
01:28:47,115 --> 01:28:51,518
One night could not succeed
where love failed.

1056
01:28:51,619 --> 01:28:55,350
"Where love failed."

1057
01:28:55,456 --> 01:28:59,153
You are right.
That illness is a joke.

1058
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:02,855
I'll write and say
you want to see him.

1059
01:29:02,964 --> 01:29:07,162
Dear Hypochondriac,
come as soon as you can.

1060
01:29:07,268 --> 01:29:09,566
Catherine awaits a letter.

1061
01:29:09,671 --> 01:29:12,071
Write in big letters
for her eyes are tired...

1062
01:29:12,173 --> 01:29:15,665
and she cannot read
small handwriting.

1063
01:29:17,378 --> 01:29:19,710
She doesn't think I was ill.

1064
01:29:19,814 --> 01:29:21,748
I don't think she is pregnant.

1065
01:29:21,849 --> 01:29:24,215
In any case,
I doubt that I'm the father.

1066
01:29:24,318 --> 01:29:26,286
I've got reasons to doubt.

1067
01:29:26,387 --> 01:29:28,878
Our past, Albert and the rest.

1068
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:31,891
Since you're going out,
could you mail this letter?

1069
01:29:31,993 --> 01:29:33,392
Certainly.

1070
01:29:42,503 --> 01:29:44,994
Oh, there's a letter for you.

1071
01:29:46,541 --> 01:29:49,032
I'm late. See you later.

1072
01:29:52,814 --> 01:29:54,509
I love you, Jim.

1073
01:29:54,615 --> 01:29:58,483
So many unbelievable things
turn out to be true.

1074
01:29:58,586 --> 01:30:00,554
I'm going to have a child.

1075
01:30:00,655 --> 01:30:05,683
Let us thank God, Jim.
I am sure you are the father.

1076
01:30:05,793 --> 01:30:09,923
I beg you to believe me.
Your love is now alive within me.

1077
01:30:10,031 --> 01:30:12,329
You must believe me.

1078
01:30:12,433 --> 01:30:14,867
This paper is your skin.
This ink is my blood.

1079
01:30:14,969 --> 01:30:18,063
I'm pressing on my pen.
Please, answer me.

1080
01:30:33,488 --> 01:30:36,980
Darling, I believe you.
I am going to you.

1081
01:30:37,091 --> 01:30:40,083
All that is good within me
comes from you.

1082
01:30:41,295 --> 01:30:43,786
They had promised
never to call each other.

1083
01:30:43,898 --> 01:30:46,264
They couldn't talk
if they couldn't touch each other.

1084
01:30:46,367 --> 01:30:49,530
The mail took three days.
Their letters crossed.

1085
01:30:49,637 --> 01:30:54,802
I've got reasons to doubt.
Our past, Albert and the rest.

1086
01:30:54,909 --> 01:30:57,742
I will stop thinking of you,
so that you can stop thinking of me.

1087
01:30:57,845 --> 01:31:00,837
You disgust me, but that is wrong.

1088
01:31:00,948 --> 01:31:03,007
Nothing should ever be disgusting.

1089
01:31:06,888 --> 01:31:09,254
My Jim, your long letter
changes everything.

1090
01:31:09,357 --> 01:31:13,418
In two days you'll be here.
Not a letter, but you.

1091
01:31:13,528 --> 01:31:17,157
Let's forget our differences.
They are gone.

1092
01:31:17,265 --> 01:31:21,292
Comeback to me soon,
even late at night.

1093
01:31:21,402 --> 01:31:23,461
At last, Jim received
a letter from Jules.

1094
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:27,904
"Your child died
before it could be born.

1095
01:31:28,009 --> 01:31:30,375
To Catherine, you died with it."

1096
01:31:31,479 --> 01:31:33,709
They had created nothing.

1097
01:31:33,815 --> 01:31:37,148
Jim thought,
new laws are beautiful...

1098
01:31:37,251 --> 01:31:40,880
but it's more practical
to obey old ones.

1099
01:31:40,988 --> 01:31:43,422
We played with life and lost.

1100
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:01,440
I don't believe it.

1101
01:32:01,542 --> 01:32:03,806
- You gave up your cottage?
- Yes.

1102
01:32:03,911 --> 01:32:05,902
We're living in France now.

1103
01:32:06,013 --> 01:32:08,880
We've rented an old mill
on the Seine.

1104
01:32:08,983 --> 01:32:12,714
We must see each other.
Drop in tomorrow.

1105
01:32:14,589 --> 01:32:16,580
Please tell me about Catherine.

1106
01:32:16,691 --> 01:32:19,524
For a long time,
I feared she'd commit suicide.

1107
01:32:19,627 --> 01:32:21,822
She had bought a gun.

1108
01:32:21,929 --> 01:32:24,989
She would say,
"So-and-so killed himself'...

1109
01:32:25,099 --> 01:32:28,728
like others say,
"So-and-so died of cholera."

1110
01:32:28,836 --> 01:32:33,170
She seemed to be in mourning.
She looked like she'd been ill.

1111
01:32:33,274 --> 01:32:38,075
She moved in slow motion
with a dead smile on her face.

1112
01:32:39,881 --> 01:32:41,974
Gilberte, this is my friend Jules.

1113
01:32:43,417 --> 01:32:48,548
Jim has told me so much about you.
I feel like I know you.

1114
01:32:52,894 --> 01:32:54,919
Does Catherine know
you've come to see me?

1115
01:32:55,029 --> 01:32:58,260
Yes. She's inviting you
for a ride in her car.

1116
01:32:58,366 --> 01:33:01,062
I'd like you
and may be your wife to come.

1117
01:33:01,168 --> 01:33:05,605
- She won't accept, but I will.
- I've got to go now.

1118
01:33:07,108 --> 01:33:10,600
No, Jules! You can't wear a hat
like that, at least not in France.

1119
01:33:10,711 --> 01:33:13,202
Here. Take mine.

1120
01:33:17,118 --> 01:33:19,518
- Hello.
- Hi.

1121
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:21,713
Come. It's over there.

1122
01:33:34,802 --> 01:33:36,963
She's in a good mood today.

1123
01:33:37,071 --> 01:33:39,005
Don't jar her.

1124
01:33:40,675 --> 01:33:42,575
Your place is beautiful.

1125
01:33:42,677 --> 01:33:45,510
Look at her car.

1126
01:33:54,388 --> 01:33:55,787
It's Jim.

1127
01:34:11,205 --> 01:34:14,697
Catherine smiled,
but she looked mysterious.

1128
01:34:14,809 --> 01:34:19,269
She took her white pajamas
and wrapped them in a neat parcel.

1129
01:34:20,581 --> 01:34:23,414
Jim wondered why
and then forgot about it.

1130
01:34:23,517 --> 01:34:25,712
They went for a drive.

1131
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,411
I'm hungry. Let's eat here.

1132
01:35:31,952 --> 01:35:34,216
Albert, what are you doing here?

1133
01:35:34,321 --> 01:35:36,221
Getting some fresh air.

1134
01:35:38,726 --> 01:35:41,217
Besides, I live here.

1135
01:35:41,328 --> 01:35:44,195
- Will you eat with us?
- Sure, if we eat now.

1136
01:35:44,298 --> 01:35:47,426
- You got a date?
- Perhaps.

1137
01:36:07,988 --> 01:36:11,480
Please give me my parcel.
Good night.

1138
01:36:21,268 --> 01:36:24,169
She's done it again.

1139
01:36:24,271 --> 01:36:26,171
I didn't expect it.

1140
01:36:26,273 --> 01:36:29,299
I thought she'd use
a new leading man.

1141
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:33,039
- Albert is an old story.
- He was perfect for tonight.

1142
01:36:33,147 --> 01:36:35,581
Leave her the car.

1143
01:36:35,683 --> 01:36:40,382
She thinks that in a couple, at least
only one person needs to be faithful.

1144
01:36:40,488 --> 01:36:43,821
- The other--
- I must go home.

1145
01:36:43,924 --> 01:36:46,449
You saw that I'm not living alone.

1146
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,859
- I'm going to marry Gilberte.
- You're wiser than I am.

1147
01:36:49,964 --> 01:36:53,730
You've realized that when it's over
with Catherine, it's all over.

1148
01:36:53,834 --> 01:36:56,359
Gilberte will make a good wife.

1149
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:58,370
She's very beautiful.

1150
01:37:08,983 --> 01:37:12,248
Jim recognized Catherine's car.

1151
01:37:12,353 --> 01:37:15,083
First he saw nothing.

1152
01:37:15,189 --> 01:37:19,148
Then he saw the car
weaving on the empty square...

1153
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:22,696
like a riderless horse,
like a ghost ship.

1154
01:37:51,492 --> 01:37:54,859
What a night.
I made a mistake.

1155
01:37:54,962 --> 01:37:57,795
That life was dead for me.

1156
01:37:57,898 --> 01:38:00,264
It was a desert, Jim.

1157
01:38:00,367 --> 01:38:02,767
I kept looking for you.

1158
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:05,031
Then come right away.

1159
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:23,954
Lie down next to me.
Kiss me.

1160
01:38:24,058 --> 01:38:27,323
There's something I must tell you.

1161
01:38:27,428 --> 01:38:28,827
Say it.

1162
01:38:33,601 --> 01:38:37,298
I found a passage
you had marked in a book.

1163
01:38:38,405 --> 01:38:40,566
"On a ship, a woman made love...

1164
01:38:40,674 --> 01:38:44,075
to a stranger in her mind."

1165
01:38:44,178 --> 01:38:46,840
It struck me as a confession.

1166
01:38:46,947 --> 01:38:49,882
That's how you explore the universe.

1167
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:52,475
I feel that curiosity too.

1168
01:38:52,586 --> 01:38:54,520
Perhaps everyone does.

1169
01:38:54,622 --> 01:38:58,217
I overcome it for your sake,
but you don't.

1170
01:38:59,927 --> 01:39:02,054
In love, I agree with you...

1171
01:39:02,162 --> 01:39:04,630
a couple is not ideal.

1172
01:39:06,133 --> 01:39:09,125
Just look around you.

1173
01:39:09,236 --> 01:39:11,704
You wanted something better...

1174
01:39:11,805 --> 01:39:14,273
by refusing to submit
to hypocrisy.

1175
01:39:15,442 --> 01:39:19,003
You wanted to invent love.

1176
01:39:20,481 --> 01:39:24,042
But pioneers must be
humble and unselfish.

1177
01:39:24,151 --> 01:39:27,177
Let's face it.

1178
01:39:27,288 --> 01:39:30,689
We have failed in everything.

1179
01:39:33,127 --> 01:39:35,357
You tried to change me.

1180
01:39:36,697 --> 01:39:40,292
I tried to spread joy,
but I've created only pain.

1181
01:39:42,169 --> 01:39:45,468
I promised to marry Gilberte...

1182
01:39:45,572 --> 01:39:48,541
but I can't postpone
my promise endlessly.

1183
01:39:48,642 --> 01:39:50,940
It's counterfeit.

1184
01:39:51,045 --> 01:39:54,173
I've no longer any hope
of marrying you.

1185
01:39:54,281 --> 01:39:58,183
Catherine, I am going
to marry Gilberte.

1186
01:39:58,285 --> 01:40:00,879
We can still have children.

1187
01:40:01,989 --> 01:40:04,685
How touching.

1188
01:40:06,593 --> 01:40:10,552
What about me?
What about me?

1189
01:40:12,232 --> 01:40:14,928
What about the children I wanted?

1190
01:40:15,035 --> 01:40:18,232
- You didn't want any.
- I did.

1191
01:40:21,275 --> 01:40:23,835
They would have been beautiful.

1192
01:40:33,454 --> 01:40:35,388
You are going to die.

1193
01:40:35,489 --> 01:40:38,424
You disgust me, Jim.
I'm going to kill you.

1194
01:40:43,697 --> 01:40:46,461
You're a coward. You're scared.

1195
01:42:05,913 --> 01:42:10,976
Jim was glad to see Jules
and to see that Catherine left him cold.

1196
01:42:11,084 --> 01:42:14,281
She tried not to leave them alone
and suggested a ride.

1197
01:42:14,388 --> 01:42:16,549
Jim agreed.
But where to?

1198
01:42:17,658 --> 01:42:21,754
Catherine drove fast
and carelessly.

1199
01:42:21,862 --> 01:42:26,765
Something was in the air,
just like the day they met Albert.

1200
01:42:26,867 --> 01:42:30,303
They stopped in a caf by a pond.

1201
01:42:30,404 --> 01:42:34,773
- Now they're burning books.
- It's unbelievable.

1202
01:42:41,982 --> 01:42:45,383
Catherine found
you were easy to get...

1203
01:42:45,486 --> 01:42:47,681
and hard to keep.

1204
01:42:47,788 --> 01:42:51,485
Your love vanished and returned...

1205
01:42:51,592 --> 01:42:54,288
with hers.

1206
01:42:54,394 --> 01:42:57,886
I never knew those ups and downs.

1207
01:42:57,998 --> 01:43:00,796
Mr. Jim, I've something to tell you.

1208
01:43:00,901 --> 01:43:02,926
Will you come with me?

1209
01:43:08,542 --> 01:43:10,635
Watch us, Jules.

1210
01:43:36,103 --> 01:43:38,697
Jules would no longer dread,
as he had from the beginning...

1211
01:43:38,805 --> 01:43:40,966
her unfaithfulness
and that he might lose her...

1212
01:43:41,074 --> 01:43:43,065
since she was gone now.

1213
01:43:43,176 --> 01:43:45,644
Their bodies were found
in the river.

1214
01:43:45,746 --> 01:43:47,873
Jim's coffin was huge.

1215
01:43:47,981 --> 01:43:50,176
It dwarfed Catherine's.

1216
01:43:50,284 --> 01:43:54,050
They left nothing of themselves.
But Jules had his daughter.

1217
01:43:55,222 --> 01:43:58,419
Did Catherine merely
seek excitement? No.

1218
01:43:58,525 --> 01:44:00,789
But she had dazed Jules.

1219
01:44:00,894 --> 01:44:03,226
He was overcome with relief.

1220
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:09,794
The friendship of Jules and Jim
had no equivalent in love.

1221
01:44:09,903 --> 01:44:12,098
They enjoyed little things together.

1222
01:44:12,205 --> 01:44:14,696
They accepted their differences
with tenderness.

1223
01:44:14,808 --> 01:44:19,040
Everyone called them
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.

1224
01:45:24,044 --> 01:45:27,536
The ashes were placed in an urn.

1225
01:45:28,649 --> 01:45:30,844
Jules might have mixed them.

1226
01:45:30,951 --> 01:45:34,648
Catherine wanted hers
to be cast to the wind...

1227
01:45:34,755 --> 01:45:37,155
but that was not permitted.
