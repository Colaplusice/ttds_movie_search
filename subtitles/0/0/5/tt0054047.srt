1
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:13,324
Hilario.

2
00:02:46,474 --> 00:02:48,518
Papa!

3
00:03:26,714 --> 00:03:28,966
Sotero! My good friend.

4
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,344
How are ya?

5
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:40,978
You have a drink?

6
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:46,734
I can't tell you what a pleasure
it is to see a village like this.

7
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:55,743
Santos!

8
00:03:55,827 --> 00:03:58,788
So much restlessness
and change in the outside world.

9
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,041
People no longer content
with their station in life.

10
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,044
Women's fashions? Shameless.

11
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:07,713
Cigar.

12
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:09,799
Mire! Religion!

13
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:14,095
You'd weep if you saw how true religion
is now a thing of the past.

14
00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:19,934
Last month we were in San Juan -
a rich town. Sit down.

15
00:04:21,436 --> 00:04:24,021
Rich town, much blessed by God.

16
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:26,607
Big church.

17
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:31,737
Not like here - little church,
priest comes twice a year. Big one!

18
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:35,741
You think we find gold candlesticks,
poor box filled to overflowing?

19
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:37,785
You know what we found?

20
00:04:37,869 --> 00:04:41,247
Brass candlesticks,
almost nothing in the poor box.

21
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,208
But we took it anyway.

22
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:47,420
I know we took it anyway.

23
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:51,591
I'm trying to show him how little religion
some people now have.

24
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:54,051
That I could see for myself.

25
00:04:56,637 --> 00:04:58,681
Don't see!

26
00:04:59,724 --> 00:05:01,934
What if you had to carry my load, huh?

27
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:06,230
The need to provide food, like a father,
to fill the mouths of his hungry men.

28
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:08,399
Guns. Ammunition.

29
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:13,613
You know how much money
that costs? Huh? Huh?!

30
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:15,323
No.

31
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:17,658
The days of good hunting are over.

32
00:05:17,742 --> 00:05:22,789
Once there was horses, cattle,
gold, fruit from the trees. No more.

33
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:28,753
Now I must hunt with a price
on my head, rurales at my heels.

34
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,010
I'll be back.

35
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,348
Enough!

36
00:05:48,397 --> 00:05:51,067
We'll get the rest when we come back.

37
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:59,325
I love this village.

38
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:04,664
- I know you have your problems...
- Murderer! Thief!

39
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:08,668
(gunshots)

40
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:13,673
Rafael!

41
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,716
Rafael!

42
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,093
Rafael...

43
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:19,429
(sobs) Rafael!

44
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:22,849
Stupid!

45
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:26,436
Stupid!

46
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,399
We have to have
another discussion very soon.

47
00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:35,736
It's always a pleasure to hear
the views of my good friend Sotero.

48
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,533
Maybe when I come back, hm?

49
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:41,617
Adis!

50
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,578
Let's go!

51
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:18,070
Help me bring him in.

52
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,762
If he steals our harvest again...

53
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:46,474
...we might as well
cut our throats and be done with it!

54
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:50,186
Leave the valley. That's what we must do.

55
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:55,483
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us? Our farms?

56
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:58,236
We... could hide some food.

57
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:03,366
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.

58
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,079
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.

59
00:08:08,162 --> 00:08:10,206
We could beg him to leave us more.

60
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:14,710
No, no. That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.

61
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,630
We must do something!

62
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:20,466
Like Rafael? Talk sense.

63
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,220
We break our backs in the fields,
and our bellies stay empty.

64
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:28,182
- We must do something!
- We must do something.

65
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:30,476
But what?

66
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,645
I don't know.

67
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:41,404
We'll ask the old man.

68
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,740
He'll know.

69
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:47,910
Fight.

70
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,663
You must fight. Fight!

71
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:54,917
With machetes and bare hands
against guns?!

72
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,587
- Buy guns.
- Buy?

73
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,883
Go to the border. Guns are plentiful there.

74
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:04,844
But what are we going to use for money?

75
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:18,483
Sell that.

76
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:21,277
And anything else you can collect.

77
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:25,531
Even if we had the guns...

78
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:30,495
...we know how to plant and grow -
we don't know how to kill.

79
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:32,955
Then learn.

80
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,124
Or die.

81
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,517
Hey! I've been waiting for you.

82
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,438
Oh, you did a wonderful job.

83
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:41,816
- I'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?!

84
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:46,320
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as
ready as the embalmer can make him...

85
00:10:46,404 --> 00:10:49,949
...but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?

86
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:54,829
It's not a question of money. For $20, I'd
plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.

87
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:57,874
But the funeral's off.

88
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,042
Well, how would you like that?!

89
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:04,630
I want him buried. You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.

90
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:09,427
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...

91
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,138
Now, look. I'm not looking for any praise.

92
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:14,640
I'm a traveling salesman - ladies' corsets.

93
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:17,435
I'm walking down the street
and a man drops dead.

94
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:21,147
For two hours people stepped over him,
without lifting a finger.

95
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,399
I'm doing what any decent man would.

96
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:26,319
- Come on, Henry...
- No! This man has to be buried.

97
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:30,656
- Soon. He's not turning into a nosegay.
- I know. I would if I could, but...

98
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,369
...there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects? To what?

99
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:39,749
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What? In Boot Hill?

100
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:43,461
There's nothing there but murderers,
cutthroats and barflies.

101
00:11:43,544 --> 00:11:46,506
And if they ever felt exclusive,
they're past it now.

102
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:49,300
They happen to be white, friend.

103
00:11:49,383 --> 00:11:51,469
And old Sam...

104
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:55,139
Well, old Sam was an Indian.

105
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,434
Well, I'll be damned!

106
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:02,396
I never knew you had to be anything
but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.

107
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,651
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilized.

108
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:09,570
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it. No, sir.

109
00:12:09,654 --> 00:12:13,032
I've always treated every man
as another future customer.

110
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:16,369
- In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.

111
00:12:16,452 --> 00:12:20,623
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- If it comes to getting his head blown off.

112
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:24,418
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it! So here.

113
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:28,798
Oh, hell! If that's all that's
holding things up, I'll drive the rig.

114
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,435
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?

115
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:42,854
You're more than welcome.

116
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:53,990
Hey! Wait a minute there. This hearse cost
me $840. It's the only one in the county.

117
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,869
- I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- I'll pay for the damages.

118
00:12:57,952 --> 00:13:01,038
- I wanna see this.
- Me, too!

119
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,794
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.

120
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:22,101
Let her buck.

121
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,636
- New in town?
- Yeah.

122
00:13:56,719 --> 00:14:00,723
- Where are you from?
- Dodge. You?

123
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:04,977
- Tombstone. See any action up there?
- Uh-uh.

124
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:09,107
- Tombstone?
- Same. People all settled down, like.

125
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,692
- Same all over.
- (man) Injun lovers!

126
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:14,487
Easy. Just wind.

127
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:19,117
- We'll get there.
- It's not getting up there that bothers me.

128
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,702
It's staying up there that I mind.

129
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,544
Coming up behind us on the left.

130
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,757
I don't think so.

131
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:43,724
Second-storey window. Curtain moved.

132
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:47,186
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.

133
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:54,360
- You elected?
- No.

134
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:56,946
I got nominated real good.

135
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:04,078
Boys, why don't you just turn around
now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?

136
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:07,081
Soon, huh?

137
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:12,587
The reception committee is forming.

138
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,983
Hold it.

139
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,402
Hold it right there.

140
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:41,157
Anything wrong?

141
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:50,333
Turn that rig around
and get it down the hill.

142
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:08,226
I need six men up here.

143
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,588
Yahoo!

144
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,512
- Boys, the drinks are on me!
- (cheering)

145
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,923
Hey! Hey!

146
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:24,177
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.

147
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:29,265
Thanks.

148
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,642
Where are you from?

149
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:35,146
Oh, yeah. Where are you goin'?

150
00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:40,651
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.

151
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:45,490
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.

152
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:48,618
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!

153
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:52,955
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.

154
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,416
Henry! The stage! Come on!

155
00:17:57,418 --> 00:17:59,670
You keep this.

156
00:18:25,947 --> 00:18:30,535
- Where are you headed?
- I'm drifting south, more or less.

157
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:32,495
You?

158
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,497
Just driftin'.

159
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,082
- Any action here?
- Yeah.

160
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:41,129
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those
bars across the street, if that's your taste.

161
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:43,756
- Ah.
- Yeah.

162
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,925
Well... see ya.

163
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,888
Say, uh... what's your name?

164
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,517
Make it Vin.

165
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,186
- What's yours?
- Chris.

166
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,082
(knock at door)

167
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,427
Yes?

168
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:40,980
We think you are a man we can trust.

169
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:45,109
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.

170
00:19:45,193 --> 00:19:48,571
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief. A murderer.

171
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:52,492
He and his men, they steal our food,
and then they leave us to starve.

172
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:56,037
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait. Just a minute.

173
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,249
- If you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did. Twice.

174
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:05,421
But they can't station men in a small
village for... who knows how long?

175
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:06,714
So they left.

176
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,968
And when they left, he came again -
Calvera - and every year since.

177
00:20:11,052 --> 00:20:13,971
He will do so until he is stopped.

178
00:20:15,556 --> 00:20:17,642
Sit down.

179
00:20:22,939 --> 00:20:27,068
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.

180
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:30,154
We know nothing about them.

181
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:32,615
Will you buy guns for us?

182
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,827
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.

183
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,580
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?

184
00:20:39,664 --> 00:20:43,334
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.

185
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:47,296
- Will you go?
- It will be a blessing if you help us.

186
00:20:47,964 --> 00:20:51,884
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no. We offer more than that.

187
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:54,971
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.

188
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:57,140
What's that?

189
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:00,309
We can sell this for gold.

190
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,520
Everything we own.

191
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:04,856
Everything of value in the village.

192
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:11,654
I've been offered a lot for my work,
but never everything.

193
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,865
Will it be enough?

194
00:21:13,948 --> 00:21:17,785
You see,
if we could drive the bandits away...

195
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:20,621
...life could be very good in our village.

196
00:21:20,705 --> 00:21:25,501
But as it is, we ourselves
could stand it a little longer...

197
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:29,255
...but the children,
they cry because they're hungry.

198
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:34,010
Do you understand what it means
when you start something like this?

199
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:36,345
We will fight, too. Every one of us.

200
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:39,515
When Calvera comes,
the church bell will ring the alarm.

201
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,185
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.

202
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:46,105
If we don't, with machetes,
axes, clubs, anything!

203
00:21:50,818 --> 00:21:52,779
Once you begin...

204
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:55,990
...you have to be prepared
for killing and more killing.

205
00:21:56,073 --> 00:21:58,910
And still more killing -
until the reason for it has gone.

206
00:21:58,993 --> 00:22:02,038
- We understand.
- We've considered that.

207
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:04,999
Does every man in the village
feel the same?

208
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,168
Every man.

209
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:12,173
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias. You know...

210
00:22:12,256 --> 00:22:15,093
Now, wait. I didn't say I'll go.

211
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:18,471
I'll pass the word around
that you're looking for men.

212
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:23,518
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.

213
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:27,063
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.

214
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:30,566
But good men?
That's something else again.

215
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,152
How can you tell they are good?

216
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:37,031
There are ways.

217
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,744
(knocking)

218
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,127
Come in.

219
00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:54,590
The word is out you're looking for men.

220
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:57,427
That's right. Men who are good with that.

221
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,638
- I'm good with it.
- Fast?

222
00:23:01,722 --> 00:23:04,684
- Try me.
- I aim to. Step in closer.

223
00:23:07,228 --> 00:23:09,897
Now, hold your hands like that.

224
00:23:10,982 --> 00:23:13,025
Now, clap.

225
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:14,777
Faster.

226
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:17,155
Now, as fast as you can.

227
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:29,083
Now you try it.

228
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:05,328
Very young and... and very proud.

229
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:11,584
The graveyards are full of boys
who were very young and very proud.

230
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,504
(knocking)

231
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:23,971
Come in.

232
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:48,079
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry! It's good to see you again.

233
00:24:48,162 --> 00:24:50,623
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?

234
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:54,293
- I heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.

235
00:24:54,377 --> 00:24:57,505
A dollar bill always looks
as big to me as a bedspread.

236
00:24:57,588 --> 00:24:59,173
It's just eating money.

237
00:24:59,257 --> 00:25:03,678
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.

238
00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:08,224
You old Cajun! You don't talk so good,
but you always know what's going on.

239
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,393
Oh, Harry.

240
00:25:12,603 --> 00:25:14,856
With your permission.

241
00:25:15,898 --> 00:25:19,694
All right. All that's on top.
What's underneath?

242
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:23,739
- Only what I told you.
- Gold? Cattle? Payroll?

243
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:27,827
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind. Tell me when you can.

244
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:31,038
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!

245
00:25:31,122 --> 00:25:33,750
I said never mind. I'm in.

246
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,918
You dirty dog!

247
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,815
Place your bets.

248
00:26:05,615 --> 00:26:07,658
Five.

249
00:26:10,828 --> 00:26:12,872
Five.

250
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:19,295
Eight.

251
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:25,510
Eights again. Ten at the point.

252
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:33,142
The cowpoke that just walked in
in the stovepipe chaps...

253
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:36,562
...I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!

254
00:26:36,646 --> 00:26:40,566
Vlgame Dios. There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.

255
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,861
The man for us
is the one who gave him that face.

256
00:26:43,945 --> 00:26:46,405
Hey... you learn fast.

257
00:26:47,824 --> 00:26:50,076
Next bet coming up.

258
00:26:59,544 --> 00:27:01,587
Crap.

259
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,845
Next man.

260
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:14,517
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.

261
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:24,444
- Vin.
- Howdy.

262
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:28,322
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whiskey.

263
00:27:28,406 --> 00:27:30,783
Have you anything lined up?

264
00:27:30,867 --> 00:27:34,704
Yeah. I'm gonna take a job
in a grocery store.

265
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:38,624
Fella says I'm gonna
make a crackerjack clerk.

266
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:40,585
Crackerjack.

267
00:27:40,668 --> 00:27:42,962
If that's your taste...

268
00:27:44,547 --> 00:27:48,760
I heard of a job shooing some flies away
from a village, but I don't know the pay.

269
00:27:48,843 --> 00:27:50,762
$20.

270
00:27:50,845 --> 00:27:53,931
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.

271
00:27:54,015 --> 00:27:56,058
Well, that's ridiculous.

272
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:01,856
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.

273
00:28:01,939 --> 00:28:05,318
Shooing some flies away
from a little village.

274
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,862
Their village.

275
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:11,449
It pays $20?

276
00:28:12,408 --> 00:28:14,911
I'm looking for men right now.

277
00:28:16,454 --> 00:28:20,249
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.

278
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:23,586
We understand. You could get
much more in a grocery store...

279
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:25,755
...and it's good, steady work.

280
00:28:26,506 --> 00:28:28,549
Yep.

281
00:28:30,384 --> 00:28:32,678
How many you got?

282
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,708
Looking for O'Reilly.

283
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:08,089
Don't know his name, but there's a fella
in back chopping wood for his breakfast.

284
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,524
Mornin'.

285
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:31,028
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.

286
00:29:31,112 --> 00:29:33,197
He tells me you're broke.

287
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:36,909
Nah, I'm doing this because
I'm an eccentric millionaire(!)

288
00:29:36,993 --> 00:29:41,998
There's a job for six men, watching over
a village, south of the border.

289
00:29:42,832 --> 00:29:45,418
How big's the opposition?

290
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:47,795
Thirty guns.

291
00:29:51,132 --> 00:29:54,719
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.

292
00:29:54,802 --> 00:29:58,264
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds
in the Travis County war.

293
00:29:58,347 --> 00:30:02,101
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.

294
00:30:02,185 --> 00:30:05,146
He said you got that Salinas thing
cleared up.

295
00:30:05,229 --> 00:30:07,774
They paid me $800 for that one.

296
00:30:07,857 --> 00:30:11,402
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...

297
00:30:11,486 --> 00:30:14,071
That's right, I cost a lot.

298
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:17,325
The offer is $20.

299
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:34,008
$20?

300
00:30:38,596 --> 00:30:41,182
Right now, that's a lot.

301
00:30:41,265 --> 00:30:44,727
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.

302
00:30:50,691 --> 00:30:53,361
- I still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.

303
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:56,989
- If he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud. He might hear you.

304
00:30:57,073 --> 00:30:59,826
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.

305
00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:02,995
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.

306
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:05,665
- Well, you ain't betting with me.
- Me either.

307
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:07,875
I told you what he said, and I believe him.

308
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:11,295
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.

309
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:13,923
Ha! Ha! Ha!

310
00:31:21,264 --> 00:31:23,516
Britt. Britt, wake up.

311
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:27,854
I'm talking to ya! Look at me!

312
00:31:31,315 --> 00:31:36,070
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong. What would you say?

313
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:41,242
Ha! Ha! Ha!

314
00:31:43,494 --> 00:31:47,707
What's the matter? You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?!

315
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:28,706
Call it.

316
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,719
Well, you see, I won.

317
00:32:41,803 --> 00:32:44,013
Well, how about it?

318
00:32:47,683 --> 00:32:49,727
Well?

319
00:32:52,772 --> 00:32:55,817
- Filene, how about it?
- I don't know. It was mighty close.

320
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,780
Close? What do you mean, close? You all
got eyes. You saw what happened. I won!

321
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,414
You tell 'em. I won, didn't I?

322
00:33:09,497 --> 00:33:11,582
You lost.

323
00:33:29,058 --> 00:33:31,352
You're a liar.

324
00:33:33,604 --> 00:33:36,149
I said you're a liar!

325
00:33:37,525 --> 00:33:40,027
I said you're a coward and a liar!

326
00:33:43,906 --> 00:33:46,909
Get up. Let's do it for real.

327
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,662
Get up!

328
00:33:49,746 --> 00:33:52,373
Get up, I said!

329
00:33:52,457 --> 00:33:56,377
So help me, I'll let you have it
right where you are.

330
00:34:08,598 --> 00:34:10,641
- Call it!
- I want nothing to do with this.

331
00:34:10,725 --> 00:34:12,935
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace. Forget it.

332
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:15,688
Get away from me.

333
00:34:28,826 --> 00:34:30,870
Call it.

334
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,369
- Britt.
- Chris.

335
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:15,373
Can I have a word with you?

336
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:27,009
Did you have any luck?

337
00:35:27,093 --> 00:35:30,304
Found a man
who would have been perfect.

338
00:35:30,388 --> 00:35:35,101
Gun or knife, you couldn't
want any better. Wasn't interested.

339
00:35:35,184 --> 00:35:37,437
The money? It wasn't enough?

340
00:35:37,854 --> 00:35:40,106
He doesn't care a hoot about money.

341
00:35:40,189 --> 00:35:43,651
A man in this line of work
who doesn't care about money?!

342
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:48,656
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.

343
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:52,201
Others, for reasons of their own,
enjoy only the danger.

344
00:35:52,285 --> 00:35:54,245
And the competition.

345
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:59,125
If he's the best with a knife and a gun,
with whom does he compete?

346
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,877
Himself.

347
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,254
(doors swing open)

348
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:07,341
You.

349
00:36:11,804 --> 00:36:15,266
- I've been looking for you!
- Uh-oh! What have we got here?

350
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:17,185
Never mind.

351
00:36:17,268 --> 00:36:19,353
He knows.

352
00:36:20,188 --> 00:36:23,316
Clap hands, he says.

353
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:27,111
Clap your hands,
and let's see how fast you are.

354
00:36:27,987 --> 00:36:30,031
Clap hands!

355
00:36:30,907 --> 00:36:33,993
A man comes to him...
cos he respects him...

356
00:36:35,787 --> 00:36:38,873
...cos he'd be proud to work with him.

357
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:44,253
He makes me look like two cents
with some damned kids' game!

358
00:36:44,337 --> 00:36:48,633
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?

359
00:36:55,807 --> 00:36:58,142
Come on, now...

360
00:36:58,226 --> 00:37:00,770
...and let's see how fast you are.

361
00:37:02,897 --> 00:37:07,026
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!

362
00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:09,779
Just draw.

363
00:37:09,862 --> 00:37:12,448
Come on. Come on, draw!

364
00:37:13,908 --> 00:37:17,036
- Campesino. Come on!
- You say campesino to me?!

365
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,124
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!

366
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,514
You don't think I mean it, huh?

367
00:37:39,142 --> 00:37:41,769
You... think I'm just talking, huh?

368
00:37:58,536 --> 00:38:00,538
Hey... get up.

369
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:04,709
Do you hear me?

370
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:09,547
Get up and face me!

371
00:38:10,631 --> 00:38:12,842
Do you hear?!

372
00:38:53,257 --> 00:38:55,301
Hey...

373
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,598
...give him my gun, huh?

374
00:39:14,612 --> 00:39:17,323
Sorry this happened, friend.

375
00:39:17,406 --> 00:39:19,867
Let him sleep it off.

376
00:39:19,951 --> 00:39:23,871
When he wakes up,
let him have his gun back.

377
00:39:23,955 --> 00:39:26,791
And give him a drink.

378
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:31,254
I changed my mind.

379
00:39:38,886 --> 00:39:43,433
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.

380
00:40:02,535 --> 00:40:04,871
Remember me?

381
00:40:11,043 --> 00:40:13,171
Yep.

382
00:40:13,254 --> 00:40:15,465
You need men to do a job in Mexico.

383
00:40:15,548 --> 00:40:17,717
- That's right.
- How long?

384
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,510
Four, six weeks.

385
00:40:19,594 --> 00:40:23,306
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?

386
00:40:24,932 --> 00:40:28,394
I thought you were looking
for the Johnson brothers.

387
00:40:28,478 --> 00:40:30,855
I found them.

388
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:34,859
- How much does the job pay?
- 20. We leave tomorrow.

389
00:40:35,568 --> 00:40:38,529
I'll have the money before I leave.

390
00:40:38,613 --> 00:40:41,699
It'll just take care of
my last two days' rent.

391
00:40:41,783 --> 00:40:45,495
$20? You must be living in style.

392
00:40:45,578 --> 00:40:47,080
Yes.

393
00:40:47,163 --> 00:40:52,043
I have the most stylish corner
of the filthy storeroom out back.

394
00:40:52,126 --> 00:40:54,378
That, and one plate of beans:

395
00:40:55,254 --> 00:40:56,923
$10 a day.

396
00:40:57,006 --> 00:41:00,843
Yeah, things do get high when
they find out you're on the run.

397
00:41:00,927 --> 00:41:03,304
There's a dry wash south of town.

398
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:07,350
Pick me up there.

399
00:41:14,315 --> 00:41:16,901
He's a good gun.

400
00:41:17,735 --> 00:41:20,321
And we aren't heading for a church social.

401
00:41:41,634 --> 00:41:43,678
Chris.

402
00:41:44,762 --> 00:41:47,640
Yeah. He picked us up at dawn.

403
00:41:49,517 --> 00:41:53,104
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah. That kid from the saloon.

404
00:41:53,187 --> 00:41:57,608
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?

405
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:18,629
I'm getting a stiff neck
keeping track of him.

406
00:42:18,713 --> 00:42:21,883
If you can't forget him,
why don't you ride side-saddle?

407
00:42:21,966 --> 00:42:24,844
Ah, well... he won't last much longer.

408
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:27,221
That so?

409
00:42:28,181 --> 00:42:32,185
Riding out there in all that dust and heat -
what a chucklehead!

410
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:34,604
Yeah. Not smart like us(!)

411
00:42:36,522 --> 00:42:38,566
Yep.

412
00:42:45,448 --> 00:42:48,493
Suppose our friend over there
has got anything to eat?

413
00:42:48,576 --> 00:42:52,288
- How about I bring him some?
- Ah, it isn't food he's hungry for.

414
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:56,709
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.

415
00:42:56,793 --> 00:43:00,046
Ah, leave him alone. It's a free country.

416
00:43:00,129 --> 00:43:02,215
And it's his.

417
00:43:34,455 --> 00:43:38,334
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.

418
00:45:23,397 --> 00:45:25,691
Where is everybody?

419
00:45:26,734 --> 00:45:30,947
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis! Asuncin! Demetrio!

420
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:34,534
Emilio! Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?

421
00:45:34,617 --> 00:45:39,539
(Hilario) Come out! Come out and make
them welcome, before we die of shame.

422
00:45:39,622 --> 00:45:42,083
Hilario, stop your shouting.

423
00:45:50,425 --> 00:45:53,803
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?!

424
00:45:53,886 --> 00:45:56,305
Come in. You must be thirsty.

425
00:45:57,974 --> 00:46:01,102
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.

426
00:46:01,185 --> 00:46:03,688
They are afraid of everyone
and everything.

427
00:46:03,771 --> 00:46:06,482
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...

428
00:46:06,566 --> 00:46:10,570
The summer may be too hot,
the winter - too cold.

429
00:46:10,653 --> 00:46:14,323
The sow has no pigs,
the farmer is afraid he may starve.

430
00:46:14,407 --> 00:46:17,535
She has too many,
he's afraid she may starve.

431
00:46:18,578 --> 00:46:23,291
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.

432
00:46:23,374 --> 00:46:27,128
Tomorrow is the anniversary
of the founding of the village.

433
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:31,382
They will be celebrating -
then, you will see them in a better light.

434
00:46:31,507 --> 00:46:33,551
(bell ringing)

435
00:46:48,775 --> 00:46:51,486
Who sounded the alarm?

436
00:46:54,822 --> 00:46:57,366
Who sounded the alarm?!

437
00:47:00,828 --> 00:47:03,331
I did.

438
00:47:16,344 --> 00:47:19,931
Thank you, amigos,
for coming out to greet us.

439
00:47:20,014 --> 00:47:22,809
Thank you for letting us see
your beautiful faces(!)

440
00:47:22,892 --> 00:47:25,853
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!

441
00:47:26,562 --> 00:47:29,232
You come running out like chickens!

442
00:47:30,108 --> 00:47:35,404
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.

443
00:47:35,488 --> 00:47:37,407
And you?

444
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:39,742
You hide from us!

445
00:47:43,162 --> 00:47:44,914
Hide... from us!

446
00:47:50,253 --> 00:47:54,048
Ah... but it's a different story
when you're in danger, huh?

447
00:47:55,341 --> 00:47:58,094
You might lose your precious crops.

448
00:47:58,177 --> 00:48:00,596
Then you flock to us. Huh?

449
00:48:04,267 --> 00:48:07,812
Well... we're here, my compadres and I.

450
00:48:08,688 --> 00:48:11,524
And here we stay.

451
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:14,277
And you?

452
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:18,781
You prove to us
that you're worth fighting for.

453
00:48:18,865 --> 00:48:22,785
Now get back to your houses,
back to work. Go on! Go back.

454
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:27,665
We'll let you know when to fight and how
to fight. Go back! All of you, go back!

455
00:48:27,749 --> 00:48:29,625
Go back!

456
00:48:42,138 --> 00:48:44,182
Now we're seven.

457
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:46,934
(drumbeats)

458
00:49:13,503 --> 00:49:17,924
You know, I've been in some towns
where the girls aren't very pretty.

459
00:49:18,007 --> 00:49:22,220
As a matter of fact, I've been in some
towns where they were downright ugly.

460
00:49:22,303 --> 00:49:25,932
But this is the first time I've been
in a town where there's no girls at all.

461
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,101
Except little ones.

462
00:49:28,184 --> 00:49:31,938
If we're not careful,
we can have quite a social life here(!)

463
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:36,609
Oh, it's not so bad. I fell in with a fast
crowd that hangs out near the fountain.

464
00:49:36,692 --> 00:49:41,072
We got to predicting the weather for today
and didn't break up till twilight.

465
00:49:49,414 --> 00:49:52,959
Stop the music! Bring out the other bull!

466
00:49:53,084 --> 00:49:55,128
(cheering)

467
00:49:57,713 --> 00:49:59,757
(firecrackers bang)

468
00:50:15,022 --> 00:50:17,066
(high-pitched note)

469
00:51:11,412 --> 00:51:12,413
Hilario!

470
00:51:12,538 --> 00:51:14,582
(whispering)

471
00:52:06,092 --> 00:52:08,136
Britt.

472
00:52:09,011 --> 00:52:13,683
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.

473
00:52:13,766 --> 00:52:15,935
(Britt) Lee.

474
00:52:16,018 --> 00:52:19,147
- Get one alive.
- Yes.

475
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,650
I'll show you where.

476
00:52:23,484 --> 00:52:26,571
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.

477
00:52:40,334 --> 00:52:42,378
(festivities continue)

478
00:52:44,714 --> 00:52:46,758
(whispers)

479
00:55:39,764 --> 00:55:44,018
- I'm sorry, Britt. I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!

480
00:55:52,902 --> 00:55:57,657
Oh... That... that was
the greatest shot I've ever seen.

481
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,784
The worst.

482
00:55:59,867 --> 00:56:02,286
I was aiming at the horse.

483
00:56:24,058 --> 00:56:27,270
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.

484
00:56:27,353 --> 00:56:30,189
It's almost certain they saw us.

485
00:56:36,779 --> 00:56:39,323
Whatever they learned
will be buried with them.

486
00:56:39,407 --> 00:56:41,868
Vlgame Dios! If he comes now...

487
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:46,622
He'd never send men ahead
if he was near enough to see for himself.

488
00:56:46,706 --> 00:56:51,586
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.

489
00:56:52,253 --> 00:56:56,966
If he rides in with no idea of
the reception we can prepare for him...

490
00:56:57,049 --> 00:57:00,845
...I promise you, we'll all teach him
something about the price of corn.

491
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:03,681
Aim...

492
00:57:03,765 --> 00:57:06,058
...squeeze...

493
00:57:06,142 --> 00:57:07,935
...cock.

494
00:57:09,228 --> 00:57:11,022
Aim...

495
00:57:11,105 --> 00:57:13,191
...squeeze...

496
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,234
...cock.

497
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:21,532
Settle down. Now, you miss the first
chance, you may not get a second.

498
00:57:23,117 --> 00:57:27,288
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.

499
00:57:27,371 --> 00:57:31,000
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.

500
00:57:31,084 --> 00:57:36,589
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.

501
00:57:38,299 --> 00:57:39,467
Fire.

502
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,469
That rock?

503
00:57:41,552 --> 00:57:43,888
No, that man you're gonna kill.

504
00:57:47,725 --> 00:57:49,602
Good!

505
00:57:49,685 --> 00:57:52,313
If only we had more guns,
think what we could do!

506
00:57:52,396 --> 00:57:55,108
- You'll get more guns.
- How?

507
00:57:55,191 --> 00:57:58,403
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.

508
00:57:58,486 --> 00:58:01,030
The ones who spied on us brought them.

509
00:58:01,114 --> 00:58:03,533
Like three kings bearing gifts.

510
00:58:11,916 --> 00:58:15,586
If Calvera does not come now,
after all of this...

511
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,880
...what a waste!

512
00:58:24,178 --> 00:58:26,639
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?

513
00:58:26,722 --> 00:58:29,767
Seor, not a fox. A coyote!

514
00:58:31,894 --> 00:58:35,022
How did he ever find out
about the gold mine?

515
00:58:35,106 --> 00:58:37,191
Gold mine?

516
00:58:38,776 --> 00:58:43,698
- What gold mine, seor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.

517
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:48,244
- In our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.

518
00:58:49,328 --> 00:58:53,082
Say, come to think of it,
it was a silver mine.

519
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:57,086
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.

520
00:58:57,170 --> 00:59:01,174
- I mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.

521
00:59:01,257 --> 00:59:04,844
Where did you hear
of this gold and silver, hm?

522
00:59:06,262 --> 00:59:09,807
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?

523
00:59:53,309 --> 00:59:55,478
Toro.

524
00:59:58,231 --> 01:00:00,066
Toro.

525
01:00:00,149 --> 01:00:01,943
Toro!

526
01:00:02,902 --> 01:00:05,154
Come on, little bull!

527
01:00:10,618 --> 01:00:12,662
Toro.

528
01:00:23,714 --> 01:00:25,758
Toro.

529
01:00:37,895 --> 01:00:40,064
(twig snaps)

530
01:01:24,859 --> 01:01:28,279
You do anything to me
and I'll kill you while you are doing it.

531
01:01:28,362 --> 01:01:33,117
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go. Let me go!

532
01:01:33,201 --> 01:01:36,079
Oh, you bite me and I'll bite you!

533
01:01:36,954 --> 01:01:39,290
I got a good mind
to throw you in the water.

534
01:01:39,373 --> 01:01:42,043
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!

535
01:01:42,168 --> 01:01:44,420
Shut up. Shut up!

536
01:01:47,381 --> 01:01:51,427
- Where are the others? Huh?
- I'll never tell you.

537
01:02:26,254 --> 01:02:28,548
Look what I found.

538
01:02:37,849 --> 01:02:41,227
- Who is she?
- From our village.

539
01:02:46,399 --> 01:02:49,444
So that's where they were. You hid them.

540
01:02:49,527 --> 01:02:52,238
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.

541
01:02:52,321 --> 01:02:55,825
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him... all of us.

542
01:02:55,908 --> 01:02:59,704
Farmers! Their families
told them we'd rape them.

543
01:03:01,706 --> 01:03:04,000
Well, we might.

544
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:08,546
In my opinion, though, you might have
given us the benefit of the doubt.

545
01:03:08,629 --> 01:03:11,215
But... just as you please.

546
01:03:12,341 --> 01:03:16,012
As long as you were out there,
why didn't you bring 'em all in?

547
01:03:16,095 --> 01:03:18,723
What for? Leave them out there.

548
01:03:18,806 --> 01:03:21,434
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.

549
01:03:21,517 --> 01:03:22,727
Bring them in.

550
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:24,896
Show him the way.

551
01:03:24,979 --> 01:03:26,731
Ma'am.

552
01:03:32,987 --> 01:03:35,782
Come on, little angel(!)

553
01:03:42,747 --> 01:03:44,791
Gently, boy.

554
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:47,710
Gently.

555
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:32,588
I can't tell you how wonderful it was
for you seoritas to fix dinner for us.

556
01:04:44,851 --> 01:04:47,895
- How's the food?
- Great.

557
01:04:47,979 --> 01:04:51,649
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada
and Spanish rice. Looks good.

558
01:04:51,733 --> 01:04:55,153
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.

559
01:04:55,236 --> 01:04:58,823
Do you know what the villagers
have been eating since we got here?

560
01:04:58,906 --> 01:05:01,784
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.

561
01:05:05,246 --> 01:05:07,373
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

562
01:05:07,915 --> 01:05:09,876
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

563
01:05:10,835 --> 01:05:12,795
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

564
01:05:12,879 --> 01:05:15,256
Do you have an older,
grateful sister at home?

565
01:05:15,339 --> 01:05:18,801
- No, sir. Many thanks.
- You're welcome.

566
01:05:18,885 --> 01:05:20,178
Many thanks.

567
01:05:20,678 --> 01:05:23,431
One, two, three, four.

568
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:26,684
One, two, three, four.

569
01:05:27,268 --> 01:05:29,771
One, two, three, four.

570
01:05:30,104 --> 01:05:33,024
One, two, three, four.

571
01:05:33,357 --> 01:05:36,360
One, two, three, four.

572
01:05:36,444 --> 01:05:37,862
One, two...

573
01:05:37,945 --> 01:05:39,322
...three, four.

574
01:05:39,405 --> 01:05:42,325
One, two, three, four.

575
01:05:42,742 --> 01:05:44,786
Squeeze.

576
01:05:45,536 --> 01:05:48,915
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze? Hm?

577
01:05:48,998 --> 01:05:51,501
Just like when
you're milking a goat, Miguel.

578
01:05:51,584 --> 01:05:55,046
- It's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!

579
01:05:55,755 --> 01:05:59,717
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.

580
01:05:59,801 --> 01:06:02,136
All right... squeeze.

581
01:06:06,349 --> 01:06:08,017
Squeeze!

582
01:06:08,101 --> 01:06:11,813
I'll tell you what. Don't shoot the gun.

583
01:06:11,896 --> 01:06:15,733
You take the gun like this
and you use it like a club. All right?

584
01:06:15,817 --> 01:06:16,859
Right.

585
01:06:16,943 --> 01:06:19,028
Flaco!

586
01:06:19,779 --> 01:06:21,823
Muchas gracias.

587
01:06:50,393 --> 01:06:51,769
Good afternoon.

588
01:06:51,853 --> 01:06:53,187
Howdy.

589
01:06:53,271 --> 01:06:56,023
We've come to move you into the village.

590
01:06:56,107 --> 01:07:00,153
- Move into the village?! Me?!
- Everybody who lives outside.

591
01:07:00,236 --> 01:07:02,572
Oh, no.

592
01:07:02,655 --> 01:07:04,365
We can't protect you out here.

593
01:07:04,449 --> 01:07:07,201
Rojas is making room for you in his home.

594
01:07:07,285 --> 01:07:11,414
Rojas?! His conversation
would bore me to death!

595
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,084
Yeah, well, uh...

596
01:07:16,419 --> 01:07:19,255
...maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.

597
01:07:19,338 --> 01:07:23,217
Farmers talk of nothing
but fertilizer and women.

598
01:07:23,301 --> 01:07:27,263
I've never shared
their enthusiasm for fertilizer.

599
01:07:27,346 --> 01:07:32,310
As for women...
I became indifferent when I was 83.

600
01:07:33,269 --> 01:07:35,438
I am staying here.

601
01:07:38,775 --> 01:07:42,111
Yeah, well, uh... what are you
gonna do when Calvera comes?

602
01:07:42,195 --> 01:07:45,156
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.

603
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:48,826
Don't worry. Why would he kill me?

604
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:51,788
Bullets cost money.

605
01:07:51,871 --> 01:07:54,832
All right. Have it your way.

606
01:07:55,541 --> 01:07:57,627
You worry about yourself.

607
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:59,921
Are you ready for him?

608
01:08:00,004 --> 01:08:02,256
What if he comes now, eh?

609
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:05,259
It's like that fella
who fell off a ten-storey building.

610
01:08:05,343 --> 01:08:07,178
What about him?

611
01:08:07,261 --> 01:08:11,474
As he was falling, people on each floor
heard him say "So far, so good."

612
01:08:11,557 --> 01:08:13,851
So far, so good!

613
01:08:41,337 --> 01:08:44,090
First of all, they'll see that ditch.

614
01:08:44,173 --> 01:08:46,467
More water for the corn.

615
01:08:49,971 --> 01:08:54,308
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.

616
01:08:55,726 --> 01:08:57,770
Hey, Chris...

617
01:08:58,855 --> 01:09:01,315
...what about that net, eh?

618
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:04,110
Well, if he's not looking for it...

619
01:09:04,193 --> 01:09:06,529
If he rides in unsuspecting.

620
01:09:07,405 --> 01:09:09,449
If, brother!

621
01:09:09,532 --> 01:09:11,617
If!

622
01:09:13,202 --> 01:09:14,537
Yeah.

623
01:09:15,413 --> 01:09:17,331
Yeah!

624
01:11:50,777 --> 01:11:55,615
I should have guessed. When my men
didn't come back, I should have guessed.

625
01:11:56,616 --> 01:11:59,911
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.

626
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:07,919
New wall!

627
01:12:08,002 --> 01:12:10,463
There are lots of new walls. All around.

628
01:12:14,467 --> 01:12:16,803
They won't keep me out.

629
01:12:16,886 --> 01:12:19,514
They were built to keep you in.

630
01:12:29,524 --> 01:12:33,111
Did you hear that? We're trapped!

631
01:12:33,194 --> 01:12:36,489
All forty of us! By these three.

632
01:12:36,572 --> 01:12:40,243
Or is it four? They couldn't afford
to hire more than that.

633
01:12:40,326 --> 01:12:42,954
We come cheaper by the bunch.

634
01:12:43,037 --> 01:12:44,789
Five!

635
01:12:44,872 --> 01:12:47,625
Even five won't give us too much trouble.

636
01:12:49,127 --> 01:12:52,088
There won't be any trouble -
if you ride on.

637
01:12:52,171 --> 01:12:53,673
Ride on?

638
01:12:53,756 --> 01:12:58,177
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?

639
01:12:58,261 --> 01:13:00,513
Buy it or grow it.

640
01:13:00,596 --> 01:13:02,974
Or maybe even work for it!

641
01:13:03,057 --> 01:13:05,226
Seven!

642
01:13:05,309 --> 01:13:08,563
Somehow, I don't think
you've solved my problem.

643
01:13:08,646 --> 01:13:11,274
Solving your problems isn't our line.

644
01:13:11,357 --> 01:13:13,735
We deal in lead, friend.

645
01:13:14,902 --> 01:13:18,865
So do I. We're in the same business, huh?

646
01:13:18,948 --> 01:13:22,785
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?

647
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:25,997
Suppose I offer you equal shares?

648
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,625
- In what?
- Everything. To the last grain.

649
01:13:29,709 --> 01:13:32,712
And the people in the village?
What about them?

650
01:13:34,714 --> 01:13:36,758
I leave it to you.

651
01:13:36,841 --> 01:13:40,428
Can men of our profession
worry about things like that?

652
01:13:40,511 --> 01:13:43,389
May even be sacrilegious.

653
01:13:44,807 --> 01:13:49,979
If God didn't want them sheared,
he would not have made them sheep.

654
01:13:50,063 --> 01:13:53,107
- What do you say?
- Ride on.

655
01:13:57,862 --> 01:14:00,156
You hear that, Sotero?

656
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,618
You hear what he said?

657
01:14:03,701 --> 01:14:05,661
Ride on.

658
01:14:05,745 --> 01:14:07,830
To me!

659
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:14,921
You tell him to ride on
before I become angry.

660
01:14:15,004 --> 01:14:17,173
Him, and the others!

661
01:14:19,092 --> 01:14:21,177
Because, if I leave with empty hands...

662
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:25,973
...everybody in this village
will answer to me - when I come back!

663
01:14:26,057 --> 01:14:29,352
- You won't come back.
- Why not?

664
01:14:29,435 --> 01:14:31,813
You won't have any guns.

665
01:14:32,647 --> 01:14:35,483
Take them off right now and drop them.

666
01:14:39,904 --> 01:14:42,824
Generosity. That was my first mistake!

667
01:14:43,783 --> 01:14:49,122
I leave these people a little bit extra
and they hire these men to make trouble.

668
01:14:49,205 --> 01:14:54,168
It shows you... sooner or later,
you must answer for every good deed.

669
01:17:28,823 --> 01:17:30,533
You were safe.

670
01:17:30,616 --> 01:17:35,288
I was face to face with them as they
rode toward me. Ten of them, screaming.

671
01:17:35,371 --> 01:17:39,167
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!

672
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,377
Ten. Ten!

673
01:17:46,174 --> 01:17:47,884
Yeh-hey!

674
01:17:47,967 --> 01:17:51,637
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- If they try it again, they'll get another!

675
01:17:51,721 --> 01:17:56,142
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all. Calvera too, huh?!

676
01:17:58,936 --> 01:18:00,813
Any sign of 'em?

677
01:18:00,897 --> 01:18:04,400
- No.
- That is bad luck.

678
01:18:04,484 --> 01:18:07,945
Can you imagine? I knew him
when he was a mouse!

679
01:18:11,282 --> 01:18:14,368
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.

680
01:18:14,452 --> 01:18:18,664
- I would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.

681
01:18:18,748 --> 01:18:20,666
- You think so?
- Of course.

682
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:23,711
He'll go away. There are other villages -

683
01:18:23,795 --> 01:18:26,506
other villages that don't sting
the way we do.

684
01:18:26,589 --> 01:18:27,757
Seor!

685
01:18:35,973 --> 01:18:39,143
Neighbours... I drink to our friends.

686
01:18:40,186 --> 01:18:45,483
They armed us, fought at our sides,
and will forever live in our hearts.

687
01:18:45,608 --> 01:18:47,902
(gunshots)

688
01:18:56,702 --> 01:18:59,163
They haven't gone, then.

689
01:19:02,792 --> 01:19:04,836
(gunshots)

690
01:19:14,262 --> 01:19:17,348
- See the gun flashin'?
- No.

691
01:19:17,432 --> 01:19:18,474
(gunshot)

692
01:19:18,558 --> 01:19:21,686
- I make it two of them.
- Three.

693
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:28,484
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.

694
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,751
Chico! Stay put.

695
01:19:48,171 --> 01:19:50,757
- Three?
- Three.

696
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:58,639
O'Reilly? Do you see them?

697
01:19:58,723 --> 01:20:02,769
No... They're too far back in the trees.

698
01:20:03,311 --> 01:20:04,979
- Chris.
- Yeah?

699
01:20:05,063 --> 01:20:09,734
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.

700
01:20:14,322 --> 01:20:16,783
(Chris) Chico... cover the back door.

701
01:20:46,187 --> 01:20:48,231
Get back!

702
01:20:49,565 --> 01:20:51,818
Get back! Go on!

703
01:20:51,901 --> 01:20:54,445
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?

704
01:20:54,529 --> 01:20:56,989
Get down. Now stay down!

705
01:21:01,369 --> 01:21:03,454
Crazy kids! You might have been hurt.

706
01:21:03,538 --> 01:21:06,916
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.

707
01:21:06,999 --> 01:21:10,420
- This is my work.
- It's our work, too.

708
01:21:10,503 --> 01:21:14,132
Everyone tells us
"Hide! Get back! Stay out of sight!"

709
01:21:14,215 --> 01:21:17,885
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave. It's the truth.

710
01:21:17,969 --> 01:21:22,014
So is he. We all are -
every boy in the village.

711
01:21:26,519 --> 01:21:29,981
We had a meeting
and we drew straws and we got you.

712
01:21:31,816 --> 01:21:34,569
You got me?
What would you mean, you got me?

713
01:21:34,652 --> 01:21:37,155
If you get killed, we avenge you.

714
01:21:37,238 --> 01:21:41,701
And we see to it that there's always
fresh flowers on your grave.

715
01:21:44,871 --> 01:21:47,665
That's a mighty big comfort(!)

716
01:21:47,749 --> 01:21:50,752
I told you he would appreciate that.

717
01:21:50,835 --> 01:21:54,338
Don't you kids be too disappointed
if your plans don't work out.

718
01:21:54,422 --> 01:21:57,467
We won't. If you stay alive,
we'll be just as happy.

719
01:21:57,550 --> 01:21:59,594
Maybe even happier.

720
01:22:00,303 --> 01:22:02,388
Maybe.

721
01:22:20,198 --> 01:22:22,658
Can you see them?

722
01:22:22,742 --> 01:22:24,827
No.

723
01:22:33,336 --> 01:22:35,755
Do your, uh...

724
01:22:35,838 --> 01:22:38,549
...hands sweat before a fight?

725
01:22:41,928 --> 01:22:45,765
- Every time.
- Mine are sweating now.

726
01:22:46,766 --> 01:22:48,810
Funny...

727
01:22:49,769 --> 01:22:52,397
Hands sweat...

728
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,108
...mouth is dry.

729
01:22:55,191 --> 01:22:58,528
You'd think it would be
the other way around.

730
01:23:02,365 --> 01:23:05,868
Does my... talking annoy you?

731
01:23:07,495 --> 01:23:08,830
Mm-mm.

732
01:23:09,539 --> 01:23:11,666
It's because I'm...

733
01:23:13,042 --> 01:23:15,211
...I'm frightened, you know?

734
01:23:16,462 --> 01:23:20,425
Yeah. I guess you kinda wish
you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?

735
01:23:20,508 --> 01:23:22,552
Yes...

736
01:23:23,886 --> 01:23:25,930
...and no.

737
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:29,100
Both at the same time.

738
01:23:30,852 --> 01:23:32,854
Yes, when I think of...

739
01:23:32,937 --> 01:23:35,022
...of what he might do.

740
01:23:37,066 --> 01:23:41,863
No, when I remember the feeling
in my chest this morning...

741
01:23:41,946 --> 01:23:44,115
...as I saw him run away.

742
01:23:45,032 --> 01:23:47,076
From us.

743
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:50,163
Man...

744
01:23:51,205 --> 01:23:53,916
...that's a feeling worth dying for!

745
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:57,837
Have you ever... felt something like that?

746
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,256
Not for a long, long time.

747
01:24:02,842 --> 01:24:04,343
I, uh...

748
01:24:05,428 --> 01:24:07,555
...envy you.

749
01:24:18,316 --> 01:24:21,360
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.

750
01:24:21,444 --> 01:24:24,197
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.

751
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:26,741
All right, I won't. But go back.

752
01:24:30,036 --> 01:24:32,872
- Does it hurt?
- What?

753
01:24:45,343 --> 01:24:47,095
No.

754
01:24:47,678 --> 01:24:50,723
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...

755
01:24:51,849 --> 01:24:55,395
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes. I know.

756
01:24:56,145 --> 01:24:59,107
I wasn't afraid of you. It's my father.

757
01:25:00,274 --> 01:25:02,652
He says "Stay away from those men."

758
01:25:03,736 --> 01:25:06,197
"They are brutes. They are cruel."

759
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:09,242
He's right. Do you know that? He's right.

760
01:25:10,743 --> 01:25:12,995
Well... go back home now.

761
01:25:14,038 --> 01:25:15,748
He is wrong.

762
01:25:18,793 --> 01:25:20,837
Well... go home anyway...

763
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,256
...before he finds out you're here.

764
01:25:24,757 --> 01:25:26,926
He already knows.

765
01:25:27,009 --> 01:25:30,471
He said he'd punish me
for being so shameless.

766
01:25:31,556 --> 01:25:33,599
But I don't care.

767
01:25:45,903 --> 01:25:48,698
They got them. They got them all!

768
01:25:48,781 --> 01:25:51,284
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?

769
01:25:51,367 --> 01:25:56,122
I doubt it. For all they know,
we're still out there ready to jump them.

770
01:25:56,205 --> 01:25:58,541
He didn't go. Calvera didn't go?

771
01:25:58,624 --> 01:26:01,210
Did you think it would be that easy?

772
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:05,757
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?

773
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,051
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.

774
01:26:09,719 --> 01:26:12,388
What else is there to do but... wait?

775
01:26:12,972 --> 01:26:15,433
- It's Calvera's move.
- Right.

776
01:26:15,516 --> 01:26:18,603
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.

777
01:26:18,686 --> 01:26:20,521
- If you were Calvera...
- Yes?

778
01:26:20,605 --> 01:26:25,735
...you'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.

779
01:26:25,818 --> 01:26:28,154
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?

780
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:31,449
Only I'm not Calvera.

781
01:26:32,784 --> 01:26:35,745
Take the rifles and the bandoleers
and pass 'em out.

782
01:26:35,828 --> 01:26:38,289
Now, let's get out there on duty.

783
01:26:49,342 --> 01:26:51,302
Food, woman.

784
01:26:51,385 --> 01:26:53,471
They'll be hungry.

785
01:27:19,455 --> 01:27:22,041
That was... that was the greatest...

786
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:24,669
New hat for you, sonny.

787
01:27:26,629 --> 01:27:28,089
Hey!

788
01:27:29,173 --> 01:27:32,552
- How do I look? Huh?
- Big improvement.

789
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:41,060
You know what? They'll make up a song
about you and this hat.

790
01:27:41,144 --> 01:27:46,482
Villages like this make up a song about
every big thing. They sing them for years.

791
01:27:46,566 --> 01:27:49,652
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?

792
01:27:49,736 --> 01:27:54,949
It's only a matter of knowing how
to shoot a gun. Nothing big about that.

793
01:27:59,829 --> 01:28:02,415
Hey... how can you talk like this?

794
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:07,211
Your gun has got you
everything you have. Isn't that true?

795
01:28:07,962 --> 01:28:10,131
Mm?

796
01:28:10,214 --> 01:28:13,718
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure. Everything.

797
01:28:13,801 --> 01:28:18,598
After a while you can call bartenders
by their first name. Maybe 200 of 'em.

798
01:28:18,681 --> 01:28:22,977
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.

799
01:28:23,061 --> 01:28:25,688
Home: none. Wife: none. Kids:

800
01:28:27,106 --> 01:28:29,317
none.

801
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,569
Prospects: zero.

802
01:28:32,945 --> 01:28:36,991
- Suppose I left anything out?
- Yeah.

803
01:28:37,075 --> 01:28:39,702
Places you are tied down to: none.

804
01:28:40,536 --> 01:28:42,914
People with a hold on you: none.

805
01:28:42,997 --> 01:28:45,708
Men you step aside for: none.

806
01:28:46,876 --> 01:28:49,128
Insults swallowed:

807
01:28:49,212 --> 01:28:51,089
none.

808
01:28:51,172 --> 01:28:53,466
Enemies: none.

809
01:28:55,802 --> 01:28:57,386
No enemies?

810
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:01,808
Alive.

811
01:29:01,891 --> 01:29:05,395
Well! This is the kind of arithmetic I like!

812
01:29:05,478 --> 01:29:07,730
Yeah, so did I at your age.

813
01:29:07,814 --> 01:29:10,566
Give these to someone
who knows how to use them.

814
01:29:10,650 --> 01:29:12,985
Yeah.

815
01:29:13,069 --> 01:29:16,155
Why don't you ask Calvera
what he has in mind for tonight?

816
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:19,617
Yes, do that. And I'll
write a song for you myself.

817
01:29:26,666 --> 01:29:29,168
Andrs,
Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.

818
01:29:29,252 --> 01:29:31,337
That's three.

819
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,758
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.

820
01:29:37,009 --> 01:29:41,097
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where
they were caught by that cursed net.

821
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:42,432
Damn them!

822
01:29:42,515 --> 01:29:45,017
Five and six.

823
01:29:45,101 --> 01:29:48,229
Emilio going over the wall.

824
01:29:48,312 --> 01:29:49,856
Seven.

825
01:29:49,939 --> 01:29:52,358
Jos near the fountain.

826
01:29:57,405 --> 01:29:59,031
Eight.

827
01:29:59,115 --> 01:30:01,743
Gregorio near the fountain.

828
01:30:07,749 --> 01:30:09,792
That's nine.

829
01:30:11,335 --> 01:30:13,129
Nine.

830
01:30:13,212 --> 01:30:15,423
Fortuno by the water ditch.

831
01:30:15,506 --> 01:30:19,385
Rico in the fields,
where they slashed him to pieces!

832
01:30:20,887 --> 01:30:22,847
That's... 10 and 11.

833
01:30:25,391 --> 01:30:26,726
Go on.

834
01:30:26,809 --> 01:30:28,603
Talk.

835
01:30:28,686 --> 01:30:30,772
Talk! Talk!

836
01:30:33,483 --> 01:30:36,778
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.

837
01:30:37,278 --> 01:30:40,740
There's still plenty of us here...
to make them pay.

838
01:30:42,450 --> 01:30:44,702
Our friends down below.

839
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:52,794
(moaning)

840
01:30:56,047 --> 01:30:58,091
Please, no!

841
01:31:10,895 --> 01:31:13,356
It's all right. You're all right.

842
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:16,442
You had a dream. Just a bad dream.

843
01:31:22,907 --> 01:31:25,076
Have no fear.

844
01:31:27,662 --> 01:31:29,705
"Have no fear"?

845
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:34,335
My very words.

846
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:37,463
10,000 times a day.

847
01:31:38,172 --> 01:31:40,883
Seor, don't punish yourself.

848
01:31:40,967 --> 01:31:45,513
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.

849
01:31:54,605 --> 01:31:57,066
Until the day you lose your nerve.

850
01:31:58,735 --> 01:32:00,778
You feel it.

851
01:32:02,155 --> 01:32:04,198
And then you wait...

852
01:32:05,283 --> 01:32:08,661
...for the bullet in the gun
that is faster than yours.

853
01:32:08,745 --> 01:32:12,749
- Seor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.

854
01:32:14,625 --> 01:32:17,128
No enemies:

855
01:32:17,211 --> 01:32:19,297
alive.

856
01:32:21,507 --> 01:32:24,594
I have lost count of my enemies.

857
01:32:25,344 --> 01:32:29,098
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.

858
01:32:29,182 --> 01:32:31,976
The final, supreme idiocy:

859
01:32:33,352 --> 01:32:35,605
coming here to hide.

860
01:32:37,315 --> 01:32:42,278
The deserter... hiding out
in the middle of a battlefield.

861
01:32:59,796 --> 01:33:01,839
One.

862
01:33:03,549 --> 01:33:06,928
There was a time
when I would have caught all three.

863
01:33:19,941 --> 01:33:22,527
We know what fear is.

864
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:25,196
We live with it all our lives.

865
01:33:26,572 --> 01:33:28,741
Only the dead are without fear.

866
01:33:39,669 --> 01:33:41,712
Rico!

867
01:33:46,551 --> 01:33:47,677
Rico!

868
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,096
One minute, Mother!

869
01:33:50,638 --> 01:33:54,559
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep,
and then we'll be back on duty.

870
01:33:54,642 --> 01:33:58,229
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.

871
01:33:58,312 --> 01:34:00,606
You're too young. Come on.

872
01:34:04,694 --> 01:34:06,738
Bernardo O'Reilly!

873
01:34:07,447 --> 01:34:09,782
You've been adopted.

874
01:34:10,742 --> 01:34:12,452
Yeah, it's my real name.

875
01:34:12,535 --> 01:34:16,956
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other,
and me in the middle.

876
01:34:20,501 --> 01:34:22,837
Now, watch carefully. Here we go.

877
01:34:24,714 --> 01:34:27,550
See? All three, right side up.

878
01:34:27,633 --> 01:34:31,054
- Think you can do it?
- Of course. That's very easy.

879
01:34:31,137 --> 01:34:34,891
Would you, uh... care to make
a friendly wager? A little bet?

880
01:34:34,974 --> 01:34:38,144
- You know we have no money.
- It doesn't have to be money.

881
01:34:38,227 --> 01:34:42,523
Whatever you have hidden away,
buried out where Calvera can't find it.

882
01:34:42,607 --> 01:34:44,108
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?!

883
01:34:44,192 --> 01:34:48,821
Yeah. They tell me a lot of precious stones
have been dug out of the mountains.

884
01:34:48,905 --> 01:34:51,699
Opals, emeralds... sapphires.

885
01:34:51,783 --> 01:34:55,453
- Oh, yes. Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denying it.

886
01:34:55,536 --> 01:34:58,414
(Harry) Well, then!

887
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:04,087
No! When you're finished,
they should all be right side up.

888
01:35:04,170 --> 01:35:06,464
Let me try it again, eh?

889
01:35:11,094 --> 01:35:14,263
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?

890
01:35:14,347 --> 01:35:17,058
(Flaco) As you say, seor,
in the mountains.

891
01:35:17,141 --> 01:35:20,436
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.

892
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:22,355
There! I got it!

893
01:35:22,438 --> 01:35:25,566
Never mind that. Why can't you tell me?

894
01:35:25,650 --> 01:35:28,361
Because I never have found
any precious stones.

895
01:35:28,444 --> 01:35:34,450
Wait. You mean Aztec treasure buried in
the hills, from when the Spaniards came?

896
01:35:34,534 --> 01:35:39,247
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure. Have you found some?

897
01:35:39,330 --> 01:35:42,250
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.

898
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:45,169
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.

899
01:35:45,253 --> 01:35:48,840
Then tell me this - how come Calvera
keeps hanging around here?

900
01:35:48,923 --> 01:35:53,010
Calvera... We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.

901
01:35:53,094 --> 01:35:55,304
No, he will not.

902
01:35:57,348 --> 01:36:00,226
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?

903
01:36:00,309 --> 01:36:02,812
Calvera isn't worried
about food for winter.

904
01:36:02,895 --> 01:36:07,150
He's worried about the food his men
haven't eaten for the last three days.

905
01:36:08,568 --> 01:36:11,404
The price of corn is going up.

906
01:36:11,487 --> 01:36:14,824
- They're starving.
- How do you know?

907
01:36:14,907 --> 01:36:18,953
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?!

908
01:36:19,829 --> 01:36:21,873
Oh...

909
01:36:22,915 --> 01:36:25,042
I've been up there.

910
01:36:26,794 --> 01:36:29,505
Well, we'd better be ready for them.

911
01:36:29,589 --> 01:36:34,260
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Vlgame Dios if they do win.

912
01:36:34,343 --> 01:36:38,056
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?

913
01:36:38,139 --> 01:36:40,892
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered. What are we to do?

914
01:36:40,975 --> 01:36:43,436
Keep on fighting.

915
01:36:43,519 --> 01:36:45,813
Do you want to see us
killed off one by one?

916
01:36:45,897 --> 01:36:48,524
That is not what you were hired for.

917
01:36:49,067 --> 01:36:52,653
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!

918
01:36:52,737 --> 01:36:54,280
I don't care.

919
01:36:54,363 --> 01:36:57,825
Go away. All of you.
Get on your horses and go.

920
01:36:57,909 --> 01:37:00,495
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.

921
01:37:00,578 --> 01:37:03,956
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet! And listen to me!

922
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:06,542
No! It is easy for them to say fight.

923
01:37:06,626 --> 01:37:10,129
They have no sons,
no daughters, no wives.

924
01:37:10,213 --> 01:37:12,632
Go. Now, before it's too late.

925
01:37:19,389 --> 01:37:21,724
Is that what you want?

926
01:37:22,308 --> 01:37:23,810
Answer me!

927
01:37:23,893 --> 01:37:29,065
Who's for going on and who's for
giving up? I want to know now.

928
01:37:35,113 --> 01:37:38,825
Don't be fools! You'll turn our village
into a graveyard.

929
01:37:38,908 --> 01:37:42,203
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.

930
01:37:42,286 --> 01:37:44,539
I'll tell you what I can do.

931
01:37:44,622 --> 01:37:48,584
I can kill the first man who so much
as whispers a word about giving up.

932
01:37:48,668 --> 01:37:52,630
The very first man,
so help me, I'll blow his head off!

933
01:38:17,780 --> 01:38:22,118
We started this fight...
and we're gonna finish it!

934
01:38:22,201 --> 01:38:24,203
With or without you.

935
01:38:39,302 --> 01:38:41,345
I'm not saying we bit off
more than we can chew...

936
01:38:41,429 --> 01:38:44,599
...but we ought to talk about
what we're gonna do.

937
01:38:44,682 --> 01:38:47,268
We start acting like
we had some good sense.

938
01:38:47,351 --> 01:38:51,272
We figured to raise the ante just enough
to make Calvera play someplace else.

939
01:38:51,355 --> 01:38:54,776
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.

940
01:38:54,859 --> 01:38:57,361
- A man can't call 'em all.
- I didn't say he could.

941
01:38:57,445 --> 01:39:01,824
All I'm saying is that sometimes
you bend with the breeze... or you break.

942
01:39:04,619 --> 01:39:06,329
Do you wanna go?

943
01:39:06,412 --> 01:39:11,918
There comes a time to get out. The village
will be no worse off than before we came.

944
01:39:12,001 --> 01:39:15,463
You forget one thing. We took a contract.

945
01:39:15,546 --> 01:39:19,842
- It's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.

946
01:39:19,926 --> 01:39:23,096
A noble thought,
but the way things are right now...

947
01:39:25,098 --> 01:39:28,559
...I don't know.
- The odds are too high.

948
01:39:28,643 --> 01:39:30,686
- Much too high.
- Then we go?

949
01:39:30,770 --> 01:39:32,814
No.

950
01:39:34,399 --> 01:39:36,275
We lower the odds.

951
01:39:36,984 --> 01:39:39,237
Right up into the hills...

952
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:41,406
...past the men on guard...

953
01:39:41,489 --> 01:39:43,658
...right into their camp.

954
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:50,706
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette
with them, we discussed a few things.

955
01:39:52,959 --> 01:39:55,002
We... you know...

956
01:39:56,087 --> 01:39:59,215
All of a sudden,
there was Calvera himself.

957
01:40:01,175 --> 01:40:04,846
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news...

958
01:40:04,929 --> 01:40:09,600
...you should have seen the look I got
from Britt - and from Chris.

959
01:40:09,684 --> 01:40:13,688
They have seen a thing or two
in their time, and done them too.

960
01:40:13,771 --> 01:40:17,692
They're not men
you can impress easily. Oh, no.

961
01:40:17,775 --> 01:40:22,113
But when they looked at me,
I knew I was one of them at last.

962
01:40:27,493 --> 01:40:29,370
Well...

963
01:40:29,454 --> 01:40:32,206
...you'd better take a look at me, too.

964
01:40:32,290 --> 01:40:36,419
Am I the kind of man
who'd live in a place like this? Hm?

965
01:40:37,378 --> 01:40:39,922
Digging my life away out in the fields?

966
01:40:40,006 --> 01:40:42,300
Me, a farmer - a peasant?

967
01:40:44,594 --> 01:40:47,305
You know what I'm saying, huh?

968
01:40:47,388 --> 01:40:51,184
Wherever they go -
Chris, Vin, Britt, the others -

969
01:40:52,351 --> 01:40:54,645
I go with them.

970
01:40:55,980 --> 01:41:01,611
And if you think you, or anything you do,
could make me change my mind, forget it.

971
01:41:03,988 --> 01:41:06,324
I want you to understand that.

972
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:10,828
I... want you to understand that...

973
01:41:14,082 --> 01:41:16,125
...this...

974
01:41:24,092 --> 01:41:26,677
...will get you nothing but this.

975
01:41:29,555 --> 01:41:32,475
We're going to hit Calvera...

976
01:41:32,558 --> 01:41:35,686
...maybe drive off some of his horses.

977
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:38,398
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.

978
01:41:38,481 --> 01:41:40,858
I'll go with you. I know every rock.

979
01:41:40,942 --> 01:41:43,444
No, you stay. You're in charge here.

980
01:41:43,528 --> 01:41:45,863
You can count on me.

981
01:41:47,573 --> 01:41:49,617
I know I can.

982
01:42:45,548 --> 01:42:49,594
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.

983
01:42:49,677 --> 01:42:52,096
We'd have heard shots.

984
01:42:54,766 --> 01:42:56,642
They've gone.

985
01:43:29,884 --> 01:43:32,053
Good evening.

986
01:43:54,325 --> 01:43:56,577
You'll be dead. All of you!

987
01:43:57,412 --> 01:43:58,871
Like that!

988
01:43:58,955 --> 01:44:01,416
If that's what you want.

989
01:44:01,499 --> 01:44:03,876
Do we have a choice?

990
01:44:06,712 --> 01:44:08,965
Of course.

991
01:44:09,048 --> 01:44:11,008
Sit down.

992
01:44:11,092 --> 01:44:13,177
Let's talk.

993
01:44:15,847 --> 01:44:18,850
Things are turned around now, uh?

994
01:44:18,933 --> 01:44:21,811
You're wondering how.

995
01:44:21,894 --> 01:44:25,189
Your friends, they don't like you
very much any more.

996
01:44:25,273 --> 01:44:27,692
You force them
to make too many decisions.

997
01:44:27,775 --> 01:44:30,570
With me... only one decision.

998
01:44:30,653 --> 01:44:32,780
Do what I say.

999
01:44:32,864 --> 01:44:35,158
You should not be surprised.

1000
01:44:35,241 --> 01:44:39,746
My good friend Sotero,
he arranged to let me come in.

1001
01:44:40,538 --> 01:44:42,582
Understand?

1002
01:44:45,752 --> 01:44:48,129
Well, anyway...

1003
01:44:48,212 --> 01:44:50,798
...to business!

1004
01:44:50,882 --> 01:44:53,676
I could kill you all. You agree?

1005
01:45:05,188 --> 01:45:07,523
Well... you don't disagree.

1006
01:45:08,941 --> 01:45:13,654
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?

1007
01:45:14,781 --> 01:45:17,867
Practical. They hear about it up north.

1008
01:45:17,950 --> 01:45:21,120
Maybe some friends of yours
make more trouble for me.

1009
01:45:21,204 --> 01:45:24,123
A man who never wants no trouble.

1010
01:45:25,374 --> 01:45:27,877
We have a saying here.

1011
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:32,298
A thief who steals from a thief
is pardoned for 100 years.

1012
01:45:32,382 --> 01:45:36,469
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing. I pardon you.

1013
01:45:38,012 --> 01:45:41,182
- Ride on.
- Just like that?

1014
01:45:41,265 --> 01:45:43,476
Mm, just like...

1015
01:45:43,559 --> 01:45:47,855
I'll make it easy for you. You want food?

1016
01:45:47,939 --> 01:45:49,649
Give them food.

1017
01:45:49,732 --> 01:45:52,235
Water? All right. Water.

1018
01:45:52,318 --> 01:45:55,321
Horses? Saddled and waiting.

1019
01:45:55,405 --> 01:45:57,490
Guns?

1020
01:45:59,117 --> 01:46:02,954
The guns... the gun belts,
you take off and put here now.

1021
01:46:09,335 --> 01:46:12,004
What about these people?

1022
01:46:12,088 --> 01:46:17,218
What happens to these people will
happen whether I kill you first or not.

1023
01:46:25,017 --> 01:46:27,228
Just a little gesture, huh?

1024
01:46:28,354 --> 01:46:32,024
To show these people
who the real boss is.

1025
01:46:32,108 --> 01:46:35,236
You go, then I give you the guns back.

1026
01:46:36,195 --> 01:46:39,073
I know you won't
use those guns against me.

1027
01:46:39,157 --> 01:46:42,577
Only a crazy man
makes the same mistake twice.

1028
01:47:10,438 --> 01:47:16,027
I don't understand why a man like you
took the job in the first place. Hm? Why?

1029
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:20,656
- I wonder myself.
- No, come on. Come on, tell me why.

1030
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:24,535
A fella I knew in El Paso took all
his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.

1031
01:47:24,619 --> 01:47:26,829
I asked him the same question: why?

1032
01:47:27,622 --> 01:47:29,040
And?

1033
01:47:29,123 --> 01:47:33,086
He said "It seemed to be
a good idea at the time."

1034
01:48:11,582 --> 01:48:13,626
Good!

1035
01:48:14,502 --> 01:48:16,212
Right.

1036
01:48:16,295 --> 01:48:20,550
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.

1037
01:48:20,633 --> 01:48:23,302
Your friends in there
owe you at least that much.

1038
01:48:23,386 --> 01:48:27,098
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.

1039
01:48:42,155 --> 01:48:45,408
You know, the first time
I took a job as a hired gun...

1040
01:48:45,491 --> 01:48:49,370
...a fella told me
"Vin, you can't afford to care."

1041
01:48:50,079 --> 01:48:51,831
There's your problem.

1042
01:48:51,914 --> 01:48:54,959
One thing I don't need
is somebody telling me my problem.

1043
01:48:55,042 --> 01:48:57,462
Like I said before, that's your problem.

1044
01:48:57,545 --> 01:49:01,507
You got involved in this village
and the people in it.

1045
01:49:02,842 --> 01:49:06,387
Do you ever get tired
of hearing yourself talk?

1046
01:49:06,471 --> 01:49:10,600
The reason I understand
your problem so well...

1047
01:49:10,683 --> 01:49:13,853
...is that I walked into
the same trap myself.

1048
01:49:14,812 --> 01:49:16,397
Yeah.

1049
01:49:16,481 --> 01:49:19,901
The first day we got here,
I started thinking...

1050
01:49:19,984 --> 01:49:24,113
...maybe I could put my gun away
and settle down and get a little land...

1051
01:49:24,197 --> 01:49:25,907
...raise some cattle.

1052
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:30,703
The things that these people know
about me wouldn't work against me.

1053
01:49:30,787 --> 01:49:35,833
I, uh... just didn't want you to think
you were the only sucker in town.

1054
01:49:54,102 --> 01:49:56,729
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.

1055
01:49:56,813 --> 01:49:59,690
- You like us, don't you?
- I guess so.

1056
01:49:59,774 --> 01:50:03,486
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.

1057
01:50:03,569 --> 01:50:06,114
- Take us with you! Please?!
- No!

1058
01:50:06,197 --> 01:50:10,535
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are... cowards.

1059
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:17,708
Don't ever say that again
about your fathers.

1060
01:50:17,792 --> 01:50:19,585
They are not cowards!

1061
01:50:22,296 --> 01:50:24,882
You think I am brave
because I carry a gun.

1062
01:50:24,966 --> 01:50:28,803
Your fathers are much braver
because they carry responsibility.

1063
01:50:28,886 --> 01:50:31,723
For you, your brothers,
your sisters and your mothers.

1064
01:50:31,806 --> 01:50:35,476
This responsibility
is like a big rock that weighs a ton.

1065
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:39,856
It bends and it twists them until finally
it buries them under the ground.

1066
01:50:39,939 --> 01:50:44,277
Nobody says they have to do it. They do it
because they love you and they want to.

1067
01:50:46,112 --> 01:50:49,657
I have never had this kind of courage.

1068
01:50:50,825 --> 01:50:52,744
Running a farm...

1069
01:50:52,827 --> 01:50:58,332
...working like a mule, with no guarantee
what will become of it - this is bravery.

1070
01:51:00,710 --> 01:51:03,588
That's why I never
even started anything like that.

1071
01:51:03,671 --> 01:51:05,757
That's why I never will.

1072
01:51:20,730 --> 01:51:23,900
You'll do much better
on the other side of the border.

1073
01:51:23,983 --> 01:51:27,195
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.

1074
01:51:27,278 --> 01:51:31,282
All you have to face is a sheriff,
a marshal.

1075
01:51:31,365 --> 01:51:33,701
Once I rob a bank in Texas.

1076
01:51:33,785 --> 01:51:37,455
Your government got after me
with a whole army. A whole army!

1077
01:51:37,538 --> 01:51:41,042
One little bank. It's clear, the meaning?

1078
01:51:41,125 --> 01:51:44,545
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!

1079
01:51:53,137 --> 01:51:54,597
Adis!

1080
01:52:40,476 --> 01:52:42,395
Adis!

1081
01:52:51,571 --> 01:52:54,449
I could have told you they'd sell us out.

1082
01:53:09,839 --> 01:53:11,883
Farmers...

1083
01:53:12,467 --> 01:53:13,718
Farmers!

1084
01:53:13,801 --> 01:53:16,637
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.

1085
01:53:18,222 --> 01:53:23,311
All they care about is their precious crops
and the miserable dirt they dig in.

1086
01:53:25,855 --> 01:53:28,024
I hate 'em.

1087
01:53:29,317 --> 01:53:32,528
- I hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.

1088
01:53:34,655 --> 01:53:38,159
Because you come
from a village just like that one.

1089
01:53:38,242 --> 01:53:40,578
You yourself are a farmer.

1090
01:53:43,122 --> 01:53:44,624
Yes.

1091
01:53:45,583 --> 01:53:47,835
Yes, I'm one of them.

1092
01:53:49,212 --> 01:53:51,923
But who made us the way we are? Hm?

1093
01:53:52,673 --> 01:53:54,926
Men with guns.

1094
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:57,637
Men like Calvera and...

1095
01:53:59,263 --> 01:54:01,432
...men like you.

1096
01:54:02,266 --> 01:54:04,310
And now me.

1097
01:54:08,356 --> 01:54:10,858
So what would you expect us to be?

1098
01:54:17,824 --> 01:54:21,077
Nobody throws me my own guns
and says run. Nobody.

1099
01:54:22,203 --> 01:54:26,582
It took me a long, long time
to learn my elbow from a hot rock.

1100
01:54:27,625 --> 01:54:32,296
Right now, I belong back in that
border town, sleeping on white sheets.

1101
01:54:35,425 --> 01:54:38,594
I think I'll ride back to that village.

1102
01:54:39,345 --> 01:54:44,517
You're crazy, all of ya! They won't lift
a finger to help. Think of the odds.

1103
01:54:45,852 --> 01:54:49,439
Harry... Nobody's asking you to go back.

1104
01:54:50,064 --> 01:54:52,942
Ride on, Harry. It's all right.

1105
01:54:53,025 --> 01:54:55,737
Bet your sweet life, I will!

1106
01:55:01,909 --> 01:55:05,204
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed? Let 'em.

1107
01:55:05,288 --> 01:55:09,041
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.

1108
01:55:10,626 --> 01:55:12,879
Except to myself.

1109
01:55:26,059 --> 01:55:28,352
You're crazy! All of ya!

1110
01:55:28,436 --> 01:55:30,813
Come on. Ya!

1111
01:56:44,679 --> 01:56:46,723
(gunshots)

1112
01:57:05,825 --> 01:57:07,869
(gunshots)

1113
01:57:25,720 --> 01:57:27,764
(gunshots)

1114
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:14,227
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!

1115
01:58:54,225 --> 01:58:56,769
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?

1116
01:58:56,853 --> 01:58:58,938
I'd hate to die a sucker.

1117
01:58:59,021 --> 01:59:02,942
We didn't come here just to keep an eye
on a lot of corn and chilli peppers.

1118
01:59:03,025 --> 01:59:05,987
There was something else
all the time, wasn't there?

1119
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:09,866
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.

1120
01:59:09,949 --> 01:59:11,701
I knew it.

1121
01:59:11,784 --> 01:59:13,911
What was it?

1122
01:59:13,995 --> 01:59:15,955
Gold.

1123
01:59:16,038 --> 01:59:20,418
- Sacks of it.
- Oh... sounds beautiful!

1124
01:59:21,210 --> 01:59:24,839
- How much?
- At least a half a million.

1125
01:59:24,922 --> 01:59:28,843
- My cut would have been what?
- About 70,000.

1126
01:59:29,969 --> 01:59:33,973
- I'll be damned!
- (kicking at door)

1127
01:59:40,897 --> 01:59:44,150
- Maybe you won't be.
- (window smashes)

1128
01:59:57,663 --> 01:59:59,707
(gunshots continue)

1129
02:00:54,929 --> 02:00:56,973
(gunshot)

1130
02:01:44,645 --> 02:01:46,689
(gunshot)

1131
02:02:16,594 --> 02:02:19,055
You came back.

1132
02:02:19,138 --> 02:02:21,641
For a place like this.

1133
02:02:22,308 --> 02:02:24,435
Why?

1134
02:02:24,519 --> 02:02:26,521
A man like you?!

1135
02:02:27,855 --> 02:02:29,899
Why?

1136
02:03:03,975 --> 02:03:08,187
- Bernardo! Bernardo!
- No. No, get back. Go on! Get back.

1137
02:03:11,524 --> 02:03:13,568
(gunshot)

1138
02:03:19,615 --> 02:03:22,034
We didn't... We didn't mean to do it.

1139
02:03:22,118 --> 02:03:24,495
We didn't mean to do it.

1140
02:03:29,167 --> 02:03:31,502
You see?

1141
02:03:31,586 --> 02:03:34,881
I told you. You see your fathers?

1142
02:03:41,054 --> 02:03:43,097
(gasps in pain)

1143
02:03:44,140 --> 02:03:46,184
What's my name?

1144
02:03:46,267 --> 02:03:49,395
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!

1145
02:03:51,022 --> 02:03:53,441
You're damn right.

1146
02:04:43,116 --> 02:04:45,368
You could stay, you know.

1147
02:04:45,451 --> 02:04:48,496
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.

1148
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:54,377
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes. The fighting is over.

1149
02:04:54,460 --> 02:04:56,546
Your work is done.

1150
02:04:56,629 --> 02:04:59,507
For them, each season has its tasks.

1151
02:05:01,092 --> 02:05:05,179
If there were a season for gratitude,
they'd show it more.

1152
02:05:06,305 --> 02:05:10,143
We didn't get any more
than we expected, old man.

1153
02:05:11,227 --> 02:05:13,563
Only the farmers have won.

1154
02:05:14,647 --> 02:05:17,066
They remain for ever.

1155
02:05:17,150 --> 02:05:19,902
They are like the land itself.

1156
02:05:21,154 --> 02:05:23,740
You helped to rid them of Calvera...

1157
02:05:24,198 --> 02:05:27,869
...the way a strong wind
helps rid them of locusts.

1158
02:05:29,704 --> 02:05:31,914
You are like the wind...

1159
02:05:31,998 --> 02:05:35,793
...blowing over the land and passing on.

1160
02:05:40,089 --> 02:05:42,383
God be with you.

1161
02:05:44,594 --> 02:05:47,180
Adis.

1162
02:06:29,555 --> 02:06:31,599
Adis.

1163
02:06:37,605 --> 02:06:38,898
Adis.

1164
02:07:11,180 --> 02:07:13,683
The old man was right.

1165
02:07:13,766 --> 02:07:15,935
Only the farmers won.

1166
02:07:16,018 --> 02:07:18,104
We lost.

1167
02:07:18,813 --> 02:07:21,107
We always lose.
