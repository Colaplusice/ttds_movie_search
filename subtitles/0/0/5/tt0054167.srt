{20193}{20240}I say. Look.
{20457}{20526}It's that chap|from upstairs.
{20872}{20955}Hello. I don't know how many times|we've passed each other on the stairs,
{20957}{21056}but tonight I'm determined at least|to say hello to you, so, hello.
{21117}{21163}I'm Helen Stephens.|I'm having a party,
{21165}{21213}and the other tenants are there|and a few friends.
{21215}{21287}We'd like you to join us.
{21289}{21353}- I'm Mark.|- Pardon?
{21396}{21460}- I am Mark.|- Oh, hello, Mark.
{21462}{21526}Please come in. You'll meet|the others who live here and...
{21528}{21600}Sorry, but... work.
{21603}{21678}Oh, well, I hope to keep it|going for ages yet,
{21680}{21748}so when you finish,|why not look in...
{21750}{21853}- Mark?|- Come on, Helen. The cake.|Everyone's waiting.
{21949}{21995}Hap-Happy birthday.
{23049}{23151}- A minute.
{23655}{23729}Oh l... I hope I'm not|disturbing you.
{23730}{23788}I knew you wouldn't|come down, so...
{23834}{23890}I brought you this.
{23892}{23990}Thank you... very much.
{23993}{24086}Well, l-I musn't|keep you from your work.
{24088}{24185}- Oh, would you...|- Oh, thank you.
{24310}{24407}- I'd like to offer you a drink.|- Oh, thank you.
{24490}{24606}- I haven't got one.|- Oh, well, I'd adore some water.
{24607}{24696}You see, a hostess can't|drink water at her own party.
{24698}{24756}It looks like|a hint to the guests.
{24758}{24835}- There's milk if you'd like some.|- Oh, very much, if you can spare it.
{24837}{24888}- Oh, yes.|- Thank you.
{25055}{25129}- Here.|- Oh, thank you very much.
{25226}{25335}This is a nice room,|and is there another inside?
{25378}{25482}- Yes.|- How long have you lived here?
{25484}{25576}- Nearly all my life.|l-I was born in this house.|- Oh?
{25619}{25714}- It's my father's.|- Do you mean at last I've|found out who our landlord is?
{25715}{25785}Your father?
{25786}{25890}Well, no. He-He's dead.|I'm the landlord.
{25891}{25938}- You?|- Yes.
{25939}{25989}But you walk about as if|you haven't paid the rent.
{26022}{26089}- I haven't.|- Oh, l-I meant...
{26091}{26137}I know.
{26138}{26212}It's his house,|and I'll never sell it.
{26215}{26272}But I can't afford the upkeep,|so I let rooms.
{26311}{26406}If I charge you too much, please|tell me, and l-I'll tell the agents.
{26406}{26459}The rent's very reasonable,|but don't say anything to the others...
{26461}{26530}or you'll have no peace.
{26531}{26645}- Peace.|- Mark, what do you do?
{26679}{26777}- Oh, thank you.|- Most of the time,|I work in a film studio.
{26778}{26825}On the photographic side|I'll bet.
{26826}{26901}- I hope to be a director very soon.|- Oh, how exciting.
{26903}{26966}When I came in, were you|looking at some films?
{26967}{27029}- Yes.|- Of yours?
{27030}{27077}- Yes.|- I'd like to see them.
{27078}{27141}Oh, I know|I'm being rude,
{27143}{27188}but I really would like|to see them.
{27190}{27272}It would be a birthday present|from you to me.
{27274}{27332}- Would it?|- Mmm.
{27334}{27442}- Oh.|- But I'm-I'm sure you're too busy and...
{27444}{27493}Will you...
{27535}{27630}- Would you like to see them now?|- Oh, thank you.
{27709}{27764}I'll go first.
{27951}{28025}Oh, it's dark.
{28027}{28118}Is that better?
{28120}{28200}But it's enormous.
{28201}{28295}Oh. Terribly sorry.
{28390}{28457}- What are these?|- Chemicals.
{28458}{28505}Oh.
{28642}{28729}This is, well...|It's so many things, but...
{28730}{28841}above all, it's so|completely unexpected.
{29081}{29151}- These all yours?|- Yes.
{29153}{29243}I mean, did you|do all this?
{29245}{29309}Mark, tell me|about this room.
{29310}{29375}- It-lt belonged to my father.|- Oh?
{29378}{29452}- What was he?|- A scientist.
{29454}{29533}Oh. Then this|equipment was his?
{29534}{29599}No, l-I sold his|to buy it.
{29601}{29648}- Sit down.|- Oh!
{29649}{29733}This all seems so,|well, terribly technical.
{29735}{29829}If this is where you work,|I can't wait to see what you work at.
{29862}{29908}Mark?
{29957}{30074}- Don't know what to show you.|- Well, what were you looking at|when I interrupted you?
{30075}{30130}All right.
{31327}{31372}Helen,
{31374}{31510}this is the first 21st birthday present|I'll ever have given.
{31540}{31613}And it's the first|I've ever asked for.
{31774}{31820}Thank you.
{32226}{32289}Mark, what|a beautiful little boy.
{32291}{32368}- Who is he?|- Me.
{32370}{32423}Of course it is.
{32425}{32538}- Then who took this film?|- My father.
{32539}{32597}What a wonderful idea.
{32598}{32645}You'll be able to show it|to your own chil...
{32646}{32735}Oh, you must've had|a bad dream.
{32737}{32797}What was the light|in your eye?
{32799}{32878}Camera, I suppose.
{33023}{33090}Whatever are you after?
{33341}{33446}Naughty boy.|I hope you were spanked.
{33600}{33709}Mark, what a strange thing|for your father to photograph.
{33711}{33757}- Switch it off?|- No.
{33759}{33838}No.
{33962}{34008}Again?
{34039}{34104}Mark, this isn't|some sort of a joke, is it?
{34123}{34204}No, Helen.
{34430}{34522}What's that?
{34780}{34874}- Mark, what are you doing?|- Wanted to photograph you watching.
{34875}{34965}No. No. Please help me|to understand this thing.
{35239}{35306}That will do, Mark.
{35307}{35422}Dry your eyes|and stop being silly.
{35493}{35546}All right now, Mark.|What was all that about?
{35548}{35608}That was a lizard,|wasn't it, or a...
{35664}{35749}A li...
{35751}{35826}Well, how'd it|get there, Mark?
{35827}{35904}How did it get there?|Was it a pet?
{35947}{36062}- Not mine.|- Won't you try to explain?
{36102}{36181}- You better go.|- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.
{36182}{36254}What was your father trying to do|to you, photographing you at night?
{36531}{36595}You better go.
{36947}{37029}Mark, what's this?
{37031}{37090}I'm saying good-bye...
{37091}{37212}to my... mother.
{37261}{37313}He photographed that?
{37316}{37388}Yes.
{37416}{37490}And this:|her funeral.
{37492}{37552}And this:|her burial.
{37553}{37632}- And this.|- Who's that?
{37634}{37714}Her successor.
{37715}{37787}Successor?
{37984}{38116}He married her six weeks after the...|previous sequence.
{38220}{38279}She filmed|what comes now.
{38307}{38374}It's out of focus.
{38376}{38454}Is that your father?
{38456}{38574}The morning he left|for his honeymoon.
{38615}{38706}But what's he doing?
{38708}{38770}Giving me a present.
{38772}{38819}What is it?
{38820}{38868}Can't you guess?
{38940}{39009}The camera.
{39496}{39558}Switch it off, Mark!
{39590}{39652}Mark, switch it off!
{39783}{39831}Let's get out of here.
{39833}{39879}Mark?
{40186}{40233}So, he was a scientist?
{40234}{40305}What kind|of a scientist, Mark?
{40306}{40410}- Biologist.|- What was he trying to do to you?
{40412}{40474}Mark, what was he trying|to do to you?
{40477}{40572}Watch me grow up.
{40574}{40644}He wanted a record|of a growing child,
{40646}{40732}complete in|every detail,
{40735}{40793}if such a thing|were possible.
{40795}{40911}And he tried to make it possible|by training a camera on me at all times.
{40913}{41009}I never knew the whole of my childhood|one moment's privacy.
{41011}{41113}And those lights in your eyes|and that thing.
{41115}{41170}He was interested|in the reactions...
{41171}{41266}of the nervous system|to... to fear.
{41267}{41318}Fear?
{41355}{41401}Fear.
{41505}{41642}Especially fear in children|and how they react to it.
{41643}{41731}I think he learned|a lot from me.
{41731}{41795}I'd wake up|sometimes screaming.
{41796}{41910}He'd be there|taking notes and pictures,
{41911}{41975}and I'm sure good|came of it...
{41977}{42032}for some people.
{42034}{42124}- He was brilliant.|- A scientist drops a lizard|onto a child's bed,
{42126}{42173}and good comes of it?
{42433}{42479}Excuse me, but...
{42481}{42528}Oh, there you are, Helen.
{42530}{42578}The party looks like breaking up,|and we were wondering if...
{42580}{42638}Oh, I'm coming.
{42640}{42707}I wish you'd join us.
{42709}{42776}Thank you.|Work.
{42778}{42862}I hope that you...
{42862}{42920}have a sweet tooth.
{42922}{42986}Thank you for my present.
{42988}{43038}Good night, Mark.
{43039}{43086}Good night, old boy.
{43422}{43478}Cut!
{43551}{43640}Look, I tell you, Mr. Jarvis, this|picture is a commercial proposition,
{43642}{43740}and that's why I want you|to do it because I know it's|the type of thing you handle.
{43742}{43831}Look, you know I've talked|to Johnnie already. I've talked|to him, and he's crazy to do it.
{43833}{43903}These are the figures|you wanted, Mr. Jarvis.
{43904}{43956}Oh, it's terrific, Mr. Jarvis.|This script is gonna...
{43958}{44041}- Still behind schedule.|...way back where it belongs.
{44043}{44090}And you know|that Paramount want it.
{44091}{44181}Yeah. Paramount want it.|MGM want it. Columbia want it.
{44183}{44258}- But is it commercial?|- Anglo want it.
{44260}{44327}Send me a memo.|We'll discuss it next week.
{44329}{44382}Now, Miss Simpson,|take a memo:
{44384}{44455}To all producers|and directors.
{44457}{44509}In light|of the new economy drive,
{44511}{44569}if you can see it and hear it,|the first take's okay.
{44571}{44627}Slate 99, take 49.|Clappers on end.
{44672}{44729}And darling,|just this once,
{44731}{44795}will you please make an effort|to forget that you're stunning,
{44797}{44858}and just try|to look stunned?
{44860}{44906}One kind word|and I would be.
{44908}{44954}All right.|Positions, everybody.
{44956}{45030}Cut.|Roll once again, please.
{45032}{45079}No, no, no, dear.
{45080}{45127}Cut. Cut.|Cut it.
{45128}{45183}- Slate 99, take 53.|- We'll run it once more, please.
{45184}{45250}Cut it!|Once again, please.
{45251}{45309}If I have to faint once more,|I will faint.
{45311}{45366}- Slate 99, take 57.|- All right. Quiet, everybody.
{45367}{45415}All right. Action!
{45415}{45537}No, no, no, no, no. Cut it.|Cut it. Cut it. It's hopeless.
{45591}{45644}- Oh, miss.|- Cut!
{45646}{45751}- Cut! How was it?|Phil? Sam? Mark?
{45753}{45841}Print it!|Hold take one.
{45843}{45905}- Okay. Alex, that's it.|- All right, boys and girls. Wrap it up.
{45906}{46007}8:30 in the morning. You're wonderful,|darling. You were really feeling it.
{46081}{46205}- Catching the bus?|- Not tonight.|Meeting someone for a drink.
{46207}{46269}Oh. I wanted to discuss|that film at the Everyman.
{46271}{46317}- Tomorrow then?|- I hope so.
{46319}{46435}- How's my favorite stand-in today, huh?|- Standing it.
{46437}{46483}8:30 in the morning.
{46485}{46557}Viv, how about having a drink|with me on the way home?
{46559}{46622}I've got a date,|Mr. Tate.
{46846}{46903}Good night,|Miss Vivian.
{47123}{47193}Yeah, Sergeant,|who's working late tonight then?
{47196}{47248}That Indian picture,|The Elephant with Two Tails.
{47250}{47308}- A bit crowded, aren't you?|- She'll take eight at a pinch.
{47310}{47362}- Which is what we'll probably get.|- Go on.
{47364}{47454}Well, I don't mind. Might as well get|pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.
{51236}{51283}Mark?
{52319}{52365}Mark?
{52568}{52622}Mark!
{52825}{52871}Well, are you there?
{52962}{53082}- Well, where are you?|- Here, Viv.
{53204}{53279}Oh, you frightened me.|Now listen.
{53281}{53329}They're working late|on the lot.
{53332}{53407}I know. They've branched|off this stage.
{53409}{53506}- We're using their power.|- We must call it off.|They're bound to see us.
{53508}{53621}They might, but they won't|interrupt us while we're filming.
{53664}{53749}- I've put the red light on.|- You've what?
{53751}{53822}- I've put the red light on. Would you...|- But...
{53825}{53883}Would you please stand|over there?
{53884}{53971}But then they'll know|someone's here.
{53972}{54069}- They won't come in.|- Well, they'll wait outside.|What's the difference?
{54071}{54161}The difference is|a perfect film.
{54163}{54304}I've waited a long time|for this and so have you.
{54305}{54408}- No one must interrupt it.|- We'll be caught.
{54410}{54487}- What does that matter?|- Oh, matter!
{54488}{54591}- You stand to lose a job as an extra.|- Extra? Stand-in.
{54593}{54646}I stand to lose nothing.
{54717}{54811}The result must be|so perfect...
{54813}{54875}that the risks don't count.
{54878}{54956}So perfect...
{54958}{55009}that even he...
{55011}{55070}even he would say...
{55072}{55179}- Who's he? Don Jarvis?|- Hmm?
{55182}{55314}- Hmm.|- Oh, he'd say, "Sign on|the dotted line, kiddies.
{55316}{55399}You can use my pen,|but bring your own ink."
{55401}{55466}Well, if you're sure|it's worth it.
{55582}{55631}It's time to find out,|Viv.
{55632}{55679}Do you mind|if I warm up?
{55681}{55750}Go ahead.
{56933}{56983}You belong there.
{57301}{57348}Oh, I do feel alone|in front of it.
{57349}{57436}- I suppose stars never do.|- They feel alone without it.
{57437}{57527}And the great ones...|feel alone all the time.
{57529}{57602}Then I'm great, boy.
{57604}{57675}What is it you want me to act?|Being frightened to death?
{57677}{57726}You remembered?
{57728}{57791}Yes, and I have a go.
{57825}{57888}- What are you doing?|- Building us a set.
{57925}{57980}Well, why don't you pull down|the studio while you're about it?
{57981}{58052}They can only|hang you once.
{58053}{58119}Exactly.
{59281}{59374}If only Don Jarvis|could see me now.
{59376}{59473}If only I could see|Don Jarvis now.
{59475}{59534}I warn you, Mark. I'm hysterical.
{59536}{59621}I'd rather act dying of laughter|if it's all the same with you.
{59713}{59844}I'll be a little lovelier each day|with fabulous pink.
{60227}{60322}- What are you doing?|- Be patient, Viv.
{60324}{60371}It's going to be|worth it.
{60428}{60517}Oh, well. I've stood alone|in front of a studio camera.
{60519}{60578}That's more than most have.
{60580}{60629}Ever stood behind one?
{60631}{60722}- No.|- Help yourself.
{60887}{60998}- Oh, I can see you, Mark. Perfectly.|- Good.
{61000}{61109}Yes, sir. I bet I'm the best|camerawoman in the business.
{61170}{61216}Now what are you doing?
{61217}{61307}Photographing you|photographing me.
{61309}{61396}Oh, Mark,|you're brilliant.
{61441}{61488}Oh, I've lost you.
{61588}{61658}Ah, welcome, stranger.
{61695}{61775}- I've lost you again.|- Never mind.
{61776}{61842}I'm ready now, Viv.
{61919}{62015}Will you... go and stand|on your cross, please?
{62017}{62106}Yes, sir,|Mr. Director, sir.
{62341}{62428}Am I supposed to imagine|someone's gonna put me in there?
{62430}{62508}- Yes, Viv.|- Oh, Mark, l...
{62508}{62559}I hope I won't|let you down.
{62561}{62642}I know you're trying to create|atmosphere for me, but...
{62644}{62703}well, I just don't feel|frightened, that's all.
{62705}{62756}Oh, wouldn't it be better|if I just did my number?
{62784}{62840}Later.
{62842}{62923}The trouble is I feel so relaxed.|That's due to you.
{62925}{63000}You're so at home with that camera,|you make me feel at home too.
{63003}{63056}You have it in you, boy.
{63114}{63185}Ready, Viv?
{63226}{63303}Oh, well, I'll try.
{63496}{63563}What would frighten|me to death?
{63637}{63700}Oh, set the mood|for me, Mark.
{63749}{63796}Imagine...
{63857}{63956}someone coming|towards you...
{64002}{64080}who wants to kill you...
{64081}{64191}regardless of|the consequences.
{64193}{64261}- A madman?|- Yes.
{64263}{64370}But he knows it,|and you don't.
{64372}{64505}And just to kill you|isn't enough for him.
{64566}{64636}- But how does that...|- Stay there, Viv.
{64638}{64692}You're just right.
{64786}{64845}But I can't imagine|what you've thought of.
{64846}{64936}Imagine... this...
{64937}{65005}would be one|of his weapons.
{65007}{65076}That?
{65077}{65145}Yes.
{65147}{65257}- That.|- Mark.
{65259}{65333}Yes, that|would be frightening.
{65334}{65381}There's something else.
{65441}{65512}Well, what is it?
{65698}{65745}That?
{65838}{65885}Mark.
{65918}{65994}Mark, no.
{65995}{66042}Take it away.
{66044}{66131}Take it away.
{66133}{66192}Mark!
{66193}{66263}Mark!
{66265}{66325}And that, darling,|is the end of the news.
{66328}{66414}- Oh, unless you want|the football results.|- Hm.
{66570}{66643}- What are you looking at?|- The ceiling.
{66645}{66740}- Wondering if that young man is home?|- Yes.
{66741}{66836}Well, he is.|I heard him come in four paragraphs ago.
{66886}{66976}He's late tonight.
{66977}{67024}- Do you like him?|- Yes.
{67025}{67088}- Why?|- Well, he has a quality.
{67090}{67136}I wish this had.
{67138}{67204}And I think he could|help me with my book.
{67289}{67374}- Helen?|- Yes?
{67376}{67462}- Doesn't matter.|- Mother, what's worrying you?
{67464}{67534}- The price of whiskey.|- What else?
{67536}{67612}- What else matters?|- Don't you like Mark?
{67615}{67668}Haven't met him.
{67670}{67742}You don't like him.|Why not?
{67744}{67833}I don't trust a man|who walks quietly.
{67834}{67898}Well, he's shy.
{67900}{68002}- His footsteps aren't. They're stealthy.|- Now, really, Mother.
{68089}{68157}- You going up to see him?|- May I?
{68205}{68299}We both have the key of the door.|Mine needs oiling.
{68301}{68423}- Yours needs exercise. Off you go.|- Thank you.
{68468}{68556}- Remember you lost the draw.|- Mm-hmm.
{68557}{68623}- Helen?|- Yes?
{68624}{68753}If you're back in five minutes,|I won't even finish this.
{68755}{68803}Done.
{69146}{69195}- Who is it?
{69197}{69269}- It's Helen.|- Oh.
{69271}{69336}Come in, Helen.
{69338}{69409}Would you just|wait in there?
{69410}{69457}Developing.
{69579}{69663}Mother heard you come in,|so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed.
{69726}{69797}Are you sure|this is convenient?
{69799}{69864}- Won't be long!
{70381}{70465}I wish to express|my gratitude to the following people...
{70466}{70525}for their|valuable contributions:
{70526}{70597}Professor A.D. Smith|of New York University,
{70599}{70722}Mr. Edward Paton of the Belgravia|Institute of Nervous Diseases...
{70724}{70808}and Mark Lewis,|my son.
{70834}{70888}- Hello.|- Oh, hello, Mark.
{70889}{70964}l-I hope|you don't mind.
{71102}{71221}I'm sure I'm being a nuisance,|but, Mark, I very much want to...
{71270}{71389}- Happy birthday.|- Mark, that's very sweet|of you, but really.
{71391}{71486}It isn't much.|l-I don't know anything about...
{71488}{71546}21st birthday presents,
{71547}{71596}but I saw it|this morning, so...
{71598}{71653}- Please.|- Mark.
{71655}{71705}Thank you.
{71707}{71766}Oh, it's beautiful.
{71767}{71830}I liked it.
{71832}{71879}- More milk?|- More?
{71881}{71934}- Milk?|- Oh, no thank you.
{71936}{72004}I'm gonna put|it on now.
{72006}{72081}There or... or there?
{72082}{72207}- Uh... first place.|- Yes, I think so too.
{72409}{72528}- Oh, I am keeping you.|- Oh. Oh, no.
{72529}{72602}l... I promise.
{72603}{72679}Mark, I'm here|for some advice.
{72681}{72787}- F-From me?|- Please.
{72826}{72921}You see, I work in a public library|in the children's section.
{72921}{73016}I'm telling you that to postpone|admitting what always embarrasses me.
{73018}{73090}- In my spare time, I write.|- What's embarr...
{73092}{73202}I write short stories for|children, but so did Grimm,|Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.
{73204}{73270}- Had any published?|I'd like to read them.|- Some short stories.
{73272}{73371}I learned today that|my first book has been accepted|for publication in the spring.
{73373}{73480}- But... But Helen, th-that's wonderful.|- Yes.
{73482}{73559}- What is it about?|- A magic camera and what it photographs.
{73617}{73718}What... Whatever made|you think of that?
{73720}{73801}I'll tell you one day.|I promise.
{73870}{73973}- W-What does it photograph?|- I'll tell you that too,|but Mark, this is the problem.
{73975}{74059}The children who read the book will want|to see the pictures the camera takes,
{74061}{74142}but the publishers say they're|impossible to photograph,|and they suggest drawings.
{74144}{74237}- But you see, I don't agree.|- Oh, no. Nothing's impossible.
{74238}{74285}Oh, I was hoping|you'd say that.
{74286}{74341}There must be photographs,|however difficult to take,
{74343}{74389}- And Mark, I was wondering if...|- Oh, yes.
{74391}{74437}- You'll discuss it with me?|- Take them.
{74439}{74485}Well, I can't ask you|to do that.
{74487}{74548}I mean, the publishers|mightn't agree.
{74550}{74617}- I'd like to take them for you.|- But the money.
{74618}{74712}There are some things|which I...
{74714}{74841}- Photograph for nothing.|- I didn't mean to offend you.
{74843}{74911}- Offend?|- Then you'll talk it over with me?
{74913}{74960}- When, please?|- That's up to you.
{74961}{75009}- Are you free tomorrow night?|- Yes.
{75009}{75086}- I hope I am.|- Well, I'll understand if you're not.
{75088}{75181}I'll try.|I'll try my hardest to be.
{75182}{75259}Thank you for listening...
{75261}{75343}and for my present.
{75420}{75500}- Good night.|- Good night.
{76085}{76183}- Looking for a trunk?|- Uh, yes. I'd like to see that one.
{76186}{76231}Certainly, Madam.
{76318}{76454}No. No, no,|no, no, no, no.
{76456}{76529}We must have some comedy|in this scene.
{76531}{76627}- We'll retake it today.|- Very good, sir.
{76629}{76694}The thing about this scene is|I must have some comedy in it.
{76696}{76753}Now you do understand, darling,|don't you? You see,
{76754}{76847}that instead of taking the first trunk,|I want you to ask to see a red one.
{76849}{76896}And when he brings that,|I want you to look around...
{76898}{76948}- And ask... excuse me a second, darling...|- Sorry.
{76949}{77028}for a white one,|then when he brings the white one,
{77030}{77159}then you ask for a different one...|this one, the blue one.
{77161}{77224}And you, Michael, bring the trunks one|by one, getting more and more fed up.
{77226}{77272}- I'll keep it light.|- I'm sure you will.
{77274}{77338}Then we'll end up on some sort of|a gag I'll think of in a minute.
{77339}{77429}- Understand? What?|- I don't feel it.
{77431}{77530}- Don't feel it.|- Don't feel it, just do it!
{77532}{77603}- All right. Positions, everybody.|- Anyone seen Viv?
{77605}{77686}- Who?|- Oh, Diane's stand-in.|I want to light the set.
{77686}{77758}- No, Phil. I want to run it first.|- All right, quiet.
{77760}{77807}All right. Ready? Action.
{77809}{77880}- Here we are, Madam.|- Oh, I'd like to see one in red.
{77882}{77937}Certainly, Madam.
{78098}{78150}Do you remember|doing it?
{78152}{78242}Right. Ready for you,|and back you go.
{78244}{78332}- Play for a close-up there.|- Um, do you have one in white?
{78334}{78405}Certainly, Madam.
{78407}{78462}There's a white one there behind you.
{78464}{78520}Right here. Again.
{78580}{78659}Good, Michael.|Excellent.
{78661}{78720}All right.|Back again.
{78722}{78834}- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?|- Certainly, Madam.
{78886}{78944}That's it, and back you go.
{78999}{79115}That's it. Just take what you can|without overdoing it.
{79191}{79258}Play it lightly, Michael.
{79259}{79354}Right. When it's in position,|keep it tight, enter him there.
{79356}{79404}Very good.
{79585}{79672}The silly bitch.|She's fainted in the wrong scene.
{79827}{79892}- Excuse me, Chief?|- Mmm?
{79894}{79941}Um, we pass my place|at the end of the bypass.
{79943}{79994}Do you mind if I|drop in for a moment?
{79995}{80064}- To collect your kid's autograph book?|- That's it, Chief.
{80066}{80121}- If the nipper finds out|where I've been...|- All right, Dawson.
{80123}{80174}Anything to help|the sergeant.
{80176}{80280}It's about time the sergeant|helped me. We're not getting|anywhere with this Soho murder.
{80283}{80359}Well, what about that chap|the landlady passed on the stairs?
{80361}{80431}She couldn't describe him except|to say that he was carrying|something she couldn't see.
{80433}{80538}- Oh, that's a help.|- Sergeant, I've been|on the force 30 years,
{80541}{80656}and I've never seen such fear|on anyone's face as on this girl's.
{80658}{80797}- What was it she saw?|- Well, surely, a man coming|at her with a sharp weapon.
{80799}{80861}Mmm. I'm familiar with|that kind of terror.
{80863}{80949}This is something new to me.|But what?
{81016}{81086}That's the one, sir.
{81390}{81458}- Chief, the expression. It's exactly...|- I know.
{81459}{81508}Don't say anything.
{81733}{81801}Well, sir, we shall probably|have to interview everyone,
{81802}{81886}so we better plan a campaign|that won't interfere too much|with your productions.
{81888}{82006}Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.|If you knew what even|a single day's delay could cost.
{82007}{82086}Oh, uh, we do, sir.
{82188}{82248}- Hello, Mark.|- Hello.
{82333}{82401}- Hey, I don't think|you ought to do that.|- Sorry, sir.
{82402}{82520}- Do what?|- Make me famous.|Some chap's giving me a screen test.
{82522}{82614}Gerry, you're next. Don't look|so scared. They can't eat you.
{82615}{82702}Looks as though it's going|to be an early night tonight.
{82704}{82779}- I've been watching you.|- Oh.
{82781}{82862}- Have you been filming those policemen?|- Hmm.
{82863}{82924}I have a few quite|interesting shots of them.
{82926}{83032}- It's a chance I never expected.|- Chance for what?
{83034}{83097}To photograph|an investigation...
{83098}{83169}or as much of it|as I can get.
{83170}{83216}What on Earth for?
{83217}{83294}It will complete|a documentary.
{83296}{83354}- Documentary, huh? What's it about?|- Mmm.
{83356}{83408}- Hmm?|- What's it about?
{83409}{83480}I'd rather not tell you|till it's finished,
{83482}{83528}and it will be soon.
{83530}{83615}- Suppose they catch you?|- Oh, they will.|They look very efficient.
{83617}{83680}- Don't you mind?|- No.
{83682}{83766}- Mark, are you crazy?|- Yes.
{83768}{83816}Do you think|they'll notice?
{83817}{83914}- Mark, you're next.|- Don't get into trouble|for heaven's sake.
{83916}{83988}I want to discuss|that film at the Everyman.
{83990}{84062}Oh, yes, I'd like that.
{84119}{84189}- Come in!
{84249}{84353}Mr. Lewis?|Ah, my photographer.
{84355}{84466}I brought you the camera in case|you wanted to take the film away.
{84521}{84590}- Chief?|- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.
{84593}{84718}As long as we don't appear at the local|next week in place of the cartoon.
{84720}{84795}I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.|This is Sergeant Miller.
{84797}{84853}Grab a chair.
{84893}{84984}Well, now, have you|anything to tell us?
{84986}{85046}- I don't think so, sir.|- Did you know the girl?
{85047}{85115}- Yes, sir.|- How well?
{85117}{85211}- Mainly by sight.|- Mm-hmm.
{85213}{85345}- When did you last see her?|- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.
{85347}{85473}- Did you speak to her?|- I called out good night.
{85475}{85544}Don't know if she heard me.
{85579}{85698}- What'd you do then?|- Oh, taking some shots.
{85700}{85771}I'm making a film.
{85773}{85867}- Oh? Where?|- Oh, all over the place.
{85869}{85915}It's a documentary.
{85917}{85992}Mm-hmm.|Anyone with you?
{85994}{86080}No, sir. Just my...|Just my camera.
{86201}{86280}Sergeant Miller.
{86282}{86340}Right.|I'll tell 'im.
{86342}{86421}The doctor's finished|his examination,
{86423}{86469}and he wants|to see you.
{86471}{86558}- Right. You'd better go on first.|- Right, sir.
{86657}{86723}Got ya.
{86724}{86771}- Nice job.|- Thank you, sir.
{86931}{86998}What time did you arrive home|last night, Mr. Lewis?
{87000}{87085}About 10:00, 10:30.
{87086}{87180}- Anyone see you?|- Yes. The people who live downstairs.
{87182}{87243}I see.
{87245}{87335}Right. That's all.|Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
{87336}{87382}- Thank you, sir.|- Okay.
{87417}{87463}Wait a minute!
{87523}{87576}Direct me to that set of yours,|would you?
{87578}{87647}I'd probably end up|on location.
{87649}{87706}- Yes, sir.|- Thank you.
{87909}{87955}I warned 'im.
{88104}{88178}Well, I think I can find my way now.|Thanks for the escort.
{89442}{89518}- No doubt at all.|Wounds caused by the same instrument.|- Mm-hmm.
{89519}{89583}Both women subjected|to the most violent shock.
{89585}{89675}- What sort of shock?|- Up to you to find out, Inspector.
{89677}{89737}Not my department.
{89739}{89822}- Can we move the body?|- Yes. L-I have finished.
{89824}{89870}That's all fellows.
{90171}{90235}Hello.|What's this she's lying on?
{90268}{90335}- Oh, a tape recorder.|- Give me a handkerchief.
{90658}{90705}Baxter!
{90827}{90897}- Get it tested for fingerprints.
{90899}{90966}- Get all the reels played back.|- Right.
{91091}{91150}Quiet, everyone.|Quiet!
{91247}{91306}I taught I heard a putty tat.
{91344}{91415}I don't want to spoil|anyone's fun,
{91417}{91466}but we do have|a maniac on our hands.
{91468}{91517}And if we don't|get 'im quickly,
{91519}{91598}there'll be a third unsolved murder|to report to the commissioner.
{91600}{91653}So let's hurry things up.|Shall we?
{92149}{92204}"She was appearing|in Arthur Baden's new film...
{92206}{92281}The Walls Are Closing In,|starring Pauline Shields.
{92283}{92375}A spokesman at the studio said|that her performance in the film|showed such promise...
{92377}{92449}that her role was|to have been built up."
{92451}{92525}- Oh, the prime minister...|- Mark is in films, isn't he?
{92526}{92620}- Yes, darling. "Sir Lav..."|- I wonder if he knew her.
{92621}{92720}- I'll ask him tonight.|- Oh. Is he taking you out?
{92722}{92816}- Yes, if he's free.|- Hmm. That's very chivalrous of 'im.
{92818}{92917}- Where is he taking you?|- I have no idea,|and I don't suppose he has.
{92942}{92994}Which studio|does he work at?
{92996}{93094}- I don't know. I'll ask him.|- If he's free.
{93096}{93162}Shall I bring him in|and introduce you?
{93163}{93249}- I feel as if I know him.|- Now, darling.
{93251}{93298}He's here.
{93366}{93434}Why don't we make him|a present of that window?
{93436}{93495}He practically lives there.
{93496}{93543}How did you know|he was there?
{93544}{93599}- The back of my neck told me.
{93684}{93745}The part that|I talk out of.
{93747}{93797}Hello.
{93798}{93871}- Free? Good. So am I.|- Yes.
{93873}{93949}I'd like you to come in|for a moment and meet my mother.
{94029}{94075}Yes, please.
{94144}{94207}Darling, this is Mark.
{94278}{94328}H-How do you do,|Mrs. Stephens?
{94330}{94376}Hello, Mark.
{94378}{94459}- Have you been running, young man?
{94460}{94547}Yes. Didn't want|to be late for Helen.
{94549}{94603}Thank you.|You deserve a drink for that.
{94605}{94696}- What would you like?|- Uh, nothing. Thank you very much.
{94698}{94760}- Hmm. Tell me, young man,|- Mother, I've left your supper...
{94762}{94826}which studio|do you work at?
{94828}{94895}Chipperfield Studio.
{94897}{94957}That poor girl,|where did she work?
{94958}{95053}- Brookwood, I think.|- Hmm.
{95055}{95104}We were wondering|if you knew her.
{95107}{95162}No.
{95164}{95220}No.|I didn't know her.
{95221}{95309}Pity.|I do like firsthand information.
{95310}{95368}Darling, may I tell you|about your supper?
{95370}{95466}No.|Go and be told about yours.
{95467}{95553}Good-bye, Mark.|I expect we shall meet again.
{95555}{95601}I hope so,|Mrs. Stephens.
{95702}{95766}- Mother, we forgot to cut the cards.
{95768}{95820}Your supper's|laid out in the kitchen.
{95822}{95886}If you're not back early,|you'll find me laid out with it.
{95887}{95973}- We'll be early. Bye, darling.|- Night.
{96244}{96323}- Mark, I want to ask you|something rather personal.|- Yes?
{96325}{96406}- How long is it since you've|gone out without that?|- Without what?
{96408}{96457}That camera.
{96459}{96551}Oh. L... I don't|think I know.
{96553}{96635}Exactly. I don't think|I've ever seen you without it.
{96637}{96694}But are you going|to need it tonight?
{96732}{96789}Well, are you?
{96792}{96856}And if so, shall I bring|some work with me too?
{96893}{96964}- I'm not going to need it tonight.|- Good, then give it to me.
{96965}{97046}- Well, I'll put it away for you.|It'll be quite safe.|- No.
{97049}{97114}Then take it upstairs|if you can't trust me with it.
{97211}{97263}I trust you.
{97357}{97404}Then let's put it|in here.
{97445}{97538}Come in and see for yourself.|We'll put it in there and lock it.
{97788}{97874}This was my...|my mother's room.
{97876}{97958}- Was it, Mark?|- Hmm.
{97999}{98049}I am being tactless,|aren't I?
{98051}{98154}It's just that I thought it was|growing into an extra limb, and l...
{98179}{98237}But bring it with you,|if you want to.
{98239}{98307}- You.|- Thank you.
{98595}{98642}- I feel...|- Yes?
{98695}{98777}I can't describe it.|Could only photograph it.
{98779}{98835}- Shall I tell you what I feel?|Famished!|- Hmm. Good.
{98862}{98907}I know a small place|around the corner.
{98909}{98955}- It's awfully good on Christmas Day.|- Is it?
{98957}{99006}- Yes. There aren't too many open then.|- No.
{99008}{99054}- Sounds fun.
{99163}{99214}- Helen?|- Yes?
{99243}{99302}Come on.|This way.
{99360}{99412}- What does your|magic camera photograph?|- People.
{99415}{99497}It's owned by a little boy,|and it sees grown-ups as they|were when they were children.
{99499}{99563}I was hoping you'd be able|to when you were...
{99807}{99867}Where is|this restaurant?
{99868}{99923}- Around the corner.|- Come along then.
{99948}{99994}Thank you.
{101018}{101087}There isn't a single face in the crowd|that doesn't look like a child.
{101089}{101175}- Don't say that.|- If you catch it at the right moment.
{101342}{101438}Oh, Helen. I would like|to find those faces for you, with you.
{101440}{101487}Well, let's try.
{101589}{101669}Oh. Mother must have|gone to bed.
{101711}{101792}- Oh, Mark... it was a wonderful evening.|- Eh...
{101841}{101891}That's what I was|going to say.
{101893}{101939}It was a wonderful evening.
{101941}{102000}And you made it wonderful...
{102001}{102088}without your camera.
{102090}{102137}I'll get it for you.
{102283}{102339}It's still here,
{102341}{102388}you're magic camera.
{102389}{102465}I wonder how|this sees grown-ups.
{102466}{102518}- Me, for instance. Now that I am one.|- Not you.
{102519}{102566}Why not?
{102567}{102640}- It will never see you.|- Mark.
{102678}{102732}Whatever I photograph,
{102734}{102780}I always lose.
{102782}{102833}I don't understand.
{103199}{103276}- Oh, he'll wake Mother.
{103337}{103431}Thank you again|for my evening.
{103433}{103526}Will you go to bed now,|and not stop up watching those films?
{103554}{103600}Well, l...
{103602}{103648}I've got some|work to do.
{103681}{103732}Then I'll|go to bed,
{103734}{103780}and try to find|your faces.
{103809}{103855}Faces which l...
{103900}{103959}Faces which...
{105363}{105425}- Good evening, Mark.|- How did you...
{105427}{105546}The young man bathing himself|brought me to your door.
{105549}{105627}I managed the rest|of the adventure alone.
{105661}{105772}This is one room|I expected to find locked.
{105774}{105832}I was never|allowed keys.
{105834}{105881}Can't get used|to them.
{105883}{105955}I brought her home early.
{105957}{106003}Thank you.
{106005}{106112}- Is there something you...|- A talk.
{106113}{106205}- Next door would be more...|- L...
{106207}{106266}I feel at home here.
{106334}{106419}l-I visit this room|every night.
{106420}{106468}Visit?
{106667}{106783}The blind always live|in the rooms they live under.
{107142}{107230}Every night you switch on|that film machine.
{107272}{107370}What are these films|you can't wait to look at?
{107402}{107449}What's the film|you're showing now?
{107506}{107561}Why don't you|lie to me?
{107564}{107635}- I'd never know.|- You would know at once.
{107637}{107737}- Take me to your cinema.|- Yes.
{107979}{108028}What am I seeing, Mark?
{108139}{108185}Why don't you answer?
{108316}{108406}Oh!
{108408}{108455}It's no good.
{108457}{108521}I was afraid|it wouldn't be.
{108524}{108610}- What?|- The lights fade too soon.
{108664}{108755}- They always do.|- L...
{108757}{108836}I have to try again.
{108931}{108992}What do you think|you've spoiled?
{108993}{109048}Opportunity.
{109049}{109122}Now I have to find|another one.
{109303}{109364}What are you doing?
{109367}{109412}Mark?
{109459}{109517}Where are you?
{109544}{109591}Where are you?
{109640}{109691}Why are you putting|that light on my face?
{109764}{109811}Mark?
{109936}{110027}- Please let me finish.
{110028}{110075}It's for Helen.
{110101}{110194}What do you mean,|"It's for Helen"?
{110196}{110264}She wanted to see|something I photographed.
{110266}{110324}My daughter sees enough|of my face without photographs.
{110326}{110432}Please, don't-|don't be frightened.
{110458}{110529}Not frightened.|Hot.
{110567}{110623}So put that|camera away!
{110983}{111029}Yes.
{111352}{111404}In rather a hurry,|aren't you?
{111405}{111465}Must be tired.
{111490}{111544}It's late.|You...
{111545}{111635}You're anxious to get rid|of me all of a sudden.
{111720}{111782}l-I won't be selfish.
{111784}{111848}You-You can take some more pictures,|if you want to.
{111850}{111897}No, thank you.
{111898}{111952}Why not?
{111977}{112027}I ran out of film.
{112029}{112112}Can't you find some more|to please Helen?
{112113}{112175}No. No.
{112204}{112260}You... You don't|trust yourself...
{112262}{112308}to take any more,|do you?
{112360}{112427}Instinct's a wonderful thing,|isn't it, Mark?
{112468}{112539}A pity it|can't be photographed.
{112604}{112672}If I'd listened to it|years ago, l...
{112674}{112734}I might have|kept my sight.
{112778}{112865}I wouldn't have let a man|operate I had no faith in.
{112867}{112949}So, I'm listening|to my instinct now.
{113075}{113199}And it says all this|filming isn't healthy,
{113200}{113265}and that|you need help.
{113267}{113319}Get it, Mark.
{113320}{113378}Get it quickly.
{113380}{113469}And until you do, I don't want you|and Helen to see each other.
{113471}{113518}I will never photograph her,|I promise you.
{113519}{113615}I'd rather you don't have the chance.|I mean it, Mark.
{113660}{113728}And if you don't|listen to me,
{113729}{113796}one of us will move|from this house.
{113797}{113887}It would be a pity, because we'll|never find a cheaper place.
{113888}{113995}You'll never have to move because of me.|l... I promise.
{114269}{114324}Good boy.
{114442}{114522}The stairs are|the difficult part.
{114897}{114957}That's far enough.|Thank you.
{115372}{115419}Taking my picture?
{115452}{115507}Yes.
{115508}{115576}It's a long time|since anyone did.
{115625}{115717}Mark, what's|troubling you?
{115767}{115834}Good night,|Mrs. Stephens.
{115836}{115893}You'll have|to tell someone.
{116000}{116060}You'll have to!
{116714}{116786}Now over here.|Swing over on me. Good.
{116789}{116856}All right. Here we go. First positions,|everybody. Absolute quiet.
{116857}{116944}- Ready to turn, Phil?|- h, yeah. Yeah. Okay.
{117010}{117079}Hey! That sneezer geezer's|a psychiatrist.
{117080}{117137}Heard it|on the grapevine.
{117140}{117208}All right, boys and girls.|First positions, everybody.
{117211}{117299}Now, take it easy, and I know you'll be|absolutely wonderful, darling.
{117301}{117356}- It's simply just...|Do you mind standing...|- Oh, I'm sorry.
{117358}{117404}- Who is this, Alex?|- It's the detective, sir.
{117406}{117506}Oh-Oh, yes. Of course it is. Everybody's|here just to help you, darling.
{117508}{117595}Now, take it easy.|It's exactly the same as it was before,
{117596}{117644}only one or two|slight changes.
{117645}{117705}This time it's hats|instead of...
{117754}{117804}of, um, of trunks.
{117806}{117876}- You will help, Michael, won't you?|You know.|- Yes, sir.
{117878}{117991}Now, darling, be very brave. You're|wonderful, and we shall all be with you.
{117992}{118094}- Just as... Oh, please!|- All right. Clear the set!|Please, makeup.
{118096}{118160}- Now, take it easy, darling. Just relax.|- All right.
{118195}{118270}All right.|And camera!
{118272}{118323}Hat, madam?
{118325}{118376}Yes. L-I'd like|to see that one.
{118378}{118424}Certainly, madam.
{118529}{118577}Thank you.
{118577}{118625}Oh.
{118626}{118689}Uh, have you|one in red?
{118691}{118737}Certainly, madam.
{118828}{118916}In red? In red?|Have you one in blue?
{118918}{118973}In blue. In blue.
{119005}{119060}Ye gods!
{119094}{119161}- Break for half an hour, sir?|- No. Break forever!
{119162}{119240}All right, boys and girls.|Break it up. Back in half an hour.
{119305}{119377}- Hmm?
{119411}{119482}Yes.
{119484}{119560}- Could you, uh, suggest something?|- Oh, it's jolly interesting.
{119561}{119616}No. I mean to help her...|psychologically.
{119618}{119699}Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.|Half an hour is useless.
{119701}{119748}Yes.|Thanks very much.
{119826}{119885}Psst!|What's your job?
{119887}{119948}- I'm... a focus puller.
{119951}{119999}Oh. So am l,|in a way.
{120025}{120090}- I wonder...|- Hmm?
{120232}{120313}I wonder if you knew|my father, Professor Lewis?
{120314}{120361}- A...|- A. N. Lewis.
{120362}{120435}Oh, of course|I knew him.
{120437}{120484}He lectured to me.|An extraordinary man.
{120485}{120556}Brilliant!|Quite brilliant!
{120557}{120646}Do you know what he was interested in...|before he died?
{120648}{120694}No. Tell me.|Tell me.
{120779}{120861}l-I don't remember|what he called it,
{120864}{120959}but it has something|to do with what...
{120960}{121048}what causes people|to be Peeping Toms.
{121051}{121158}Scoptophilia, that would interest him.|Most fertile mind.
{121160}{121282}- Scopto...|- Philia. The morbid urge to gaze.
{121285}{121368}Coined since his day. Now tell me,|are there any of his manuscripts left?
{121369}{121420}- I thought it could be cured.|- Usually. Yeah.
{121421}{121472}- Now about his manuscripts.|- Quickly.
{121474}{121567}The cure. Oh, very quick. A couple|of years' analysis three times a week,
{121569}{121645}an hour a time|and soon it's uprooted.
{121671}{121722}Now, are there any|of his papers left?
{121724}{121788}I should be most grateful|if I could see them.
{121789}{121843}l-I'll give you|my address.
{122052}{122112}Yes, Doctor.
{122113}{122208}- I wonder what all that's about?|- I don't know.
{122210}{122257}We'll find out afterwards.
{122722}{122769}Hey, Mark.
{122832}{122883}Can't wait|to show you this.
{122885}{122933}I should charge ya.
{122935}{123003}You don't get that|in Sight and Sound.
{123004}{123055}Oh, she's terrific.
{123081}{123135}I got some more,|if you're interested.
{123161}{123259}You've given me...|an idea.
{123261}{123347}Hey, I'll bet|I have.
{123349}{123408}He asked me if I knew his father,|which I did.
{123409}{123471}- Brilliant man.|- Is that all he wanted?
{123473}{123560}I think so. Oh, we had|a little chat about scoptophilia.
{123562}{123628}- And he's going to... Voyeurism.|- About what?
{123629}{123709}- Eh?|- What makes people into Peeping Toms,
{123711}{123775}one of his father's|subjects, and...
{123777}{123823}Peeping Tom?
{123825}{123896}Interesting boy.|He has his father's eyes.
{123898}{123963}You don't suspect him,|do you?
{123965}{124016}I suspect them all.
{124017}{124077}- Action!|- What about you?
{124078}{124161}I'm interested in this fantastic|extrovert who brought the girl in.
{124164}{124212}There's something|on his mind.
{124214}{124287}No wonder.|He's the director.
{124289}{124353}Can't manage Saturday, sir.
{124355}{124461}But... But they're|letting us off early today.
{124463}{124556}This afternoon after work...|might be my only chance.
{124557}{124624}Well, uh, be here|at 6:00, Mark.
{124625}{124672}I'll have Milly waiting.
{124673}{124755}- 6:00?|- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.
{124757}{124817}- I'll be there.|- You'd better be.
{124820}{124889}- The last shot of the day.|Make it a good one.|- Okay.
{124890}{124942}- You got your list, Sergeant?|- Yes, sir.
{124944}{125017}I want to see how some of them|spend their spare time.
{125019}{125091}- Which ones?|- Exactly, Sergeant.
{126628}{126711}- Oh, there you are.|Now, don't make a habit of this.|- I won't, sir.
{126712}{126765}- Milly's upstairs.|- Thank you, sir.
{126767}{126817}Now, I've got to go out.|If you finish before I'm back,
{126819}{126867}Iock up and put this|through the letter box.
{126869}{126934}What are you looking at?|Haven't you seen a key before?
{126936}{127010}The till will be empty,|if that's what you're smiling about.
{127012}{127087}Now, remember what I said.|No more of this fancy stuff.
{127487}{127572}You've spoiled my whole evening,|you have.
{127573}{127661}- And I had a date with my new boyfriend.|- Sorry, Milly.
{127662}{127708}Well, what's the idea?
{127768}{127824}I may not be here tomorrow.
{127825}{127917}Why? Going on maneuvers with the|Boy Scouts? Now what are you doing?
{127919}{128032}- I thought so.|- Come on. We haven't got all night.
{128033}{128094}There's all that nude stuff|on the bed to finish.
{128254}{128334}Well, of all the...
{128336}{128395}- Have you gone completely crazy?
{128397}{128494}I'm just completing|a documentary.
{128497}{128556}You're a documentary|and a half, you are.
{128557}{128608}- I didn't stand up|my gentleman friend...
{128609}{128705}and come back here and take my clothes|off for you to start filming the street.
{128871}{128942}I might as well|talk to a zombie.
{128944}{129005}Is it safe to be alone|with you, I wonder?
{129007}{129072}Might be more fun|if it wasn't.
{130445}{130508}Drive straight on.
{130723}{130778}- Hello.|- Oh, hello, Tony.
{130779}{130858}- Where are you going? You...|- To leave something for Mark.
{130861}{130929}- You haven't much time|for me these days.|- Oh, Tony, l...
{130930}{131000}It's all right.|I'll be here if you want me.
{131002}{131074}Oh, by the way, your mother|was yelling out before you came in.
{131076}{131136}Something about Mark|photographing her.
{131137}{131209}Photographing Mother?|You must be mistaken.
{131211}{131281}- Of course. Uh, see you sometime.|- Yeah.
{131437}{131492}Mark?
{131527}{131573}Mark?
{131626}{131674}Mark.
{133125}{133171}I don't know|what to make of it, sir.
{133173}{133274}He went to a public library,|and then to a newsagent's shop.
{133276}{133342}For private photography,|if you ask me.
{133345}{133399}Shall I hang around|outside the house, sir?
{133401}{133477}No. I don't|think so either.
{133478}{133567}All right, sir. I'll give you|the details when I get back. Bye, sir.
{135234}{135293}Don't let me|see you are frightened.
{135294}{135374}- So, leave. Hurry up!|- No!
{135375}{135422}Leave!
{135459}{135511}Not till I know.
{135513}{135586}- Now.|- That film...
{135588}{135645}That film is...
{135647}{135694}just a film,|isn't it?
{135696}{135757}It's horrible.
{135759}{135836}Horrible. But it's|just a film, isn't it?
{135862}{135911}No.
{135988}{136034}No.
{136037}{136082}I killed them.
{136294}{136366}You'll be safe, as long as I can't|see you frightened.
{136368}{136428}So stand in|the shadows, please.
{136454}{136500}Please.
{136676}{136765}Inspector Gregg.|What?
{136766}{136817}Put him on the line.
{136819}{136941}Peters here. Yes. I went upstairs|to look around, and I found her lying.
{136942}{137000}What's the address?
{137002}{137048}Newsagent's shop!
{137050}{137147}Your mother is right.
{137174}{137243}Must tell someone everything.
{137278}{137342}Sorry it has to be you.
{137438}{137487}This was his workshop.
{137523}{137583}And you know|some of what he did,
{137622}{137667}but not all.
{137837}{137891}- Aged five.
{138039}{138086}Aged seven.
{138157}{138238}All the rooms|were wired for sound,
{138240}{138294}and they still are.
{138325}{138372}- Your room.
{138373}{138440}- Happy birthday.|- Here. Open this one.
{138442}{138537}- Your mother's.
{138626}{138696}- Tony's.|- No one will come in,|honestly, darling.
{138698}{138749}- I don't care.|- But, darling.
{138752}{138811}- Tony, stop it!|- The door is locked.
{138813}{138864}- I don't care. I'm scared.
{138865}{138961}- Turn it off.
{138964}{139035}- Look at me, Mark.|- Not if you're frightened.
{139035}{139133}Look at me!|What did you do to those girls?
{139134}{139199}- No.|- What did you do?
{139201}{139277}If you want to torment me for the rest|of my life, then make me imagine.
{139278}{139340}What did you do|to those girls?
{139342}{139392}l... I can't.
{139394}{139440}Show me.
{139484}{139536}But if you're|frightened...
{139538}{139609}Show me, or I'll remain frightened|for the rest of my life.
{139610}{139657}Show me!
{140088}{140169}Do you know what the most frightening|thing in the world is?
{140329}{140375}It's fear.
{140401}{140471}So I did something|very simple.
{140507}{140554}Very simple.
{140588}{140690}- When they felt the spike...
{140692}{140738}touching their throat,
{140778}{140852}and knew I was going|to kill them,
{140854}{140954}I made them watch|their own deaths.
{140989}{141043}I made them see...
{141045}{141132}their own terror|as the spike went in.
{141134}{141204}And if death has a face,
{141206}{141266}they saw that too.
{141297}{141353}But not you.
{141354}{141433}I promised I'd never|photograph you.
{141434}{141496}Not you.
{141498}{141573}Frightened for you.
{141978}{142024}- Got the men all right?|- Yes, sir.
{142026}{142072}- Okay, let's go.|- Look out!
{142112}{142184}- It's only a camera.|- Only?
{142316}{142438}- Give yourself up, Mark!|- I've been ready for this|for such a long time.
{142440}{142534}- What are you doing?|- That's all right.
{142630}{142680}All right. He's there!|All right. Come on, then!
{142682}{142734}I can beat that.
{142883}{142929}Give yourself up, Mark!
{143010}{143057}Watch them, Helen.
{143058}{143106}Watch them say good-bye.
{143109}{143206}One by one.|I've timed it so often.
{143256}{143340}I wish I could have|found your faces for you.
{143517}{143612}Helen! Helen!|I'm afraid.
{143614}{143682}No. No. Mark.
{143756}{143848}And I'm glad|I'm afraid.
{144994}{145041}Girl's alive.
{145102}{145157}Go get an ambulance.
{145158}{145250}All right.|All right. Don't be a silly boy.
{145252}{145328}There's nothing|to be afraid of.
{145574}{145663}Good night, Daddy. Hold my hand.
