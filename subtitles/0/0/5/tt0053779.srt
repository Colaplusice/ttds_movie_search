1
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,956
Leondina, whas the matter?

2
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,919
Look, is Jesus!
Where are they going?

3
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,878
Where are you taking
the statue?

4
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,719
- What?
- Where are you taking it?

5
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,555
They're taking it to the Pope!

6
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,518
He wants the phone number! No!

7
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,155
Hey, you, come here, please.

8
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,038
What did they eat at table N 16?

9
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,076
The prince ate snails.

10
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,676
- What wine?
- Soave.

11
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,713
- No, Valpolicella! Hi, Marcello!
- Hi.

12
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,872
Snails and Valpolicella.
Let me take a picture.

13
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,076
Is not possible!

14
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,119
Why do you pay him?
I give out information!

15
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,599
Manager, stop that photographer!

16
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,159
- Give me the film!
- Oh, come on!

17
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,996
A light.

18
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,837
- Listen, honey, come here.
- Me?

19
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,879
- I'm talking to you. - Whas
the matter? - I must talk to you.

20
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,956
Good evening, how are you?

21
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,475
- Sit down.
- There's no chair.

22
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,120
- Squat down!
- Sorry.

23
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,040
- Naughty!
- Why?

24
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,076
You're naughty.

25
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,598
And I'll break your little face!

26
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,316
Just a little publicity.

27
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,790
You got her into trouble
with her husband.

28
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,156
Do I worry
about your being cuckold?

29
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,630
- You're not a journalist.
- Great journalism!

30
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,350
- Shut up! Be careful!
- You'll kill me!

31
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,633
- Has he arrived?
- Not yet.

32
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,156
Tell him he's an idiot!
Whisky!

33
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,400
This place is unbearable!

34
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,872
Good evening, Maddalena.
Alone? Want to dance?

35
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,916
No.

36
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,636
Want to drink some Vodka?

37
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,190
No. Everything's wrong tonight.
I'm leaving.

38
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,239
- Can I accompany you?
- I don't know...

39
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,110
- Your friends.
- Marcello, where are you going?

40
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,953
- Miss Maddalena!
- Leave me alone tonight!

41
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,794
Welcome back!
More beautiful than a star!

42
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,917
Always the same song.
They never change?

43
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,949
Paparazzo, stop it!
You're a public figure!

44
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,112
Marcello, where are you going?

45
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,472
I'd like to live in a new city.

46
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,676
I like Rome very much.

47
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,470
Is a jungle
where one can hide well.

48
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,078
I'd like to hide too, but I can't.

49
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,439
- Whall we do?
- Take a ride.

50
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,314
- I'm fed up with Rome! I'd like
an island. - If you buy one.

51
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,349
I considered the possibility.
Would I really go there?

52
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,030
Your problem is
you have too much money.

53
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,078
Your problem is
you don't have enough.

54
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,638
Meanwhile here we are,
the two of us.

55
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,475
Thas not a problem. We're among
the few people to be unhappy.

56
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,632
- What did you do here?
- Nothing.

57
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,952
You're so rich, if you fall,
you'll land standing up.

58
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,508
- You think so?
- Sure.

59
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,955
I can't even stand up!

60
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,952
I need an enthusiastic push.

61
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,708
When I make love there's tension.

62
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,759
- Only love gives me strength.
- Long live love!

63
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,676
Annamaria, look here!

64
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,800
That car looks like an apartment!

65
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,998
- Are you Liliana?
- I'm not Liliana.

66
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,833
- And who are you?
- Good evening.

67
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,469
- Good evening.
- Who are you talking to?

68
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,516
Who's there?

69
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,876
Liliana went to Milan.

70
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,838
- Are you coming with us?
- Me?

71
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,753
Yes... you, come with us.

72
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,519
She says if I go with her.
Should I?

73
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,874
Les take a ride with this girl.

74
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,110
What do you want to do?

75
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,512
Nothing. I'll take her home.
You know her?

76
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,275
No. I don't think so.

77
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,152
I'm going to eat.
I'll see you there.

78
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,800
Turn off the lights, fanatic!

79
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,113
Get paid.
They're richer than Onassis.

80
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,679
- Are you coming? - If you
take me home, I'd appreciate it.

81
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,718
- Are you coming?
- Nope.

82
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,916
But I live far.

83
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,558
- Sit on the back.
- Thanks.

84
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,834
- Are you okay there? - Yes.
- Bye! - Bye, Annamaria.

85
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,879
- Where do you live?
- At Cessati Spiriti.

86
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,478
- Is that your car?
- Yes.

87
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,756
- Did you buy it for her?
- Her father.

88
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,310
All my father gave me
were beatings!

89
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,393
- Do you know my father?
- You introduced him to me.

90
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,278
Where do your parents live?

91
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,831
- In Cesena.
- Is there the sea? - No.

92
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,876
Well, how is it going?

93
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,795
So, so...

94
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,470
Things didn't go well tonight?

95
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,314
A truffle gave me
1,000 lira and cigarettes.

96
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,309
- Was he young or old?
- I didn't look at him in the face!

97
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,433
- Would you go with a woman
like this one? - No.

98
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,308
Why?
She's not worse than many others.

99
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,951
- You don't go with women
like this? - Yes, sometimes.

100
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:28,676
Listen, Gregory Peck... I'd like
to know something. Whall we do?

101
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,436
- We'll take you home, okay?
- Yes.

102
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,789
- Why? What did you think?
- Me, nothing!

103
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,510
We'll wake everyone up.
Turn off the radio!

104
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,229
- We'll leave immediately.
- Is someone home?

105
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,392
- Whas she saying?
- If someone is home.

106
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:05,157
- No, my cousin is in Velletri.
- Will you offer us some coffee?

107
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,834
Gladly. I make good coffee.

108
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,550
Don't expect a palace!

109
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,076
I'll lead the way.

110
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,236
The coffee.

111
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,276
Watch out for the stairs.
The other evening a man...

112
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,718
Darn! Is flooded again!

113
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,430
Wait a moment.

114
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,638
"The engineer!"
He should have been a grave-digger!

115
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,510
Thall be the day! I've been
absolving all the devil's sins!

116
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,676
Damn!

117
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,109
I'll take you to the bedroom.

118
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,838
Is flooded here too.
I'll make some coffee.

119
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,832
Some recommendation is needed.

120
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,869
- I made a request two years ago
but... - Don't worry.

121
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,480
I make some coffee, okay?

122
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,076
Would you close the door?

123
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,756
You want to make love here?

124
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,076
No?

125
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,716
I'll leave your coffee here.

126
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,790
You didn't agree before?
Are you crazy?

127
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,352
They did everything!
I hope they give me 2,000 lira!

128
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,477
2,000? I set the price!

129
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,519
- Are they husband and wife?
- Oh, come on!

130
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,513
Here. Many thanks.
Must I back up?

131
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,037
No. Turn right at the end.
Can I give you a little kiss?

132
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,875
- Thanks. Come back when you want!
- Bye.

133
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,916
Slow down with that car!

134
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,478
Oh, my God!

135
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,636
Emma!

136
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,791
Emma! Emma!
Emma, answer, what happened?

137
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,029
What did you do? Crazy fool!

138
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,068
Emma!

139
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,154
Is nothing. Keep calm!
I'll take you to the hospital.

140
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,038
Why are you so crazy?

141
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,476
You want to ruin me, huh?

142
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,916
One day I'll just let you die!

143
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,311
Emma... stop it now.

144
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,756
Emma, darling...

145
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,628
My love... Emma...

146
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,996
Hurry up!

147
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,630
Did you bring that woman
that poisoned herself?

148
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,553
Giannelli,
don't write anything, please.

149
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,756
I'll get involved with the police.

150
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,718
What happened?
What is her name?

151
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,678
I can't tell you.
Leave me alone.

152
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,832
- You can come in.
- Thanks.

153
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,272
- Emma!
- Don't tire her. She must rest.

154
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,269
In two hours
you can take her back home.

155
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,238
Go to the brigadier for the report.
Is obligatory.

156
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,276
Emma!

157
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,557
Emma, why did you do it? Why?

158
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,596
The brigadier is waiting for you.

159
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,996
I'll be right back.

160
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,430
Wait, he'll be right in.

161
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,159
- Sister, can I use the phone?
- Sure.

162
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,799
- You can't stay here!
- I just want to take a picture!

163
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,436
Take your glasses off.

164
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,592
The producer Toto Scalise
has just arrived.

165
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,878
He's signed up the star
for a great picture.

166
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,951
Is it the Swedish woman?

167
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,032
I'd better not see her,
otherwise I'll kill my wife!

168
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,236
Long live Sweden!

169
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:46,476
The beautiful Swedish actress
tastes a typical Italian product,

170
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,588
which is as colourful
and joyful as our country.

171
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,717
Hi, Marcello,
great piece of meat, huh?

172
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,759
Toto Scalise is leading the star
through the customs...

173
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,790
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, thank you.

174
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,836
What a confusion!

175
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,998
- Come on Marcello, pass him!
- Stop it!

176
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,039
I want to take a picture!
Pass him!

177
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,118
Is it true you always bathe in ice?

178
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,237
Which Italian historical figure
would you like to play?

179
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,675
Do you like bearded men?

180
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,718
What do you think
about Italian actresses?

181
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,190
Do you think Italian Neorealism
is dead or alive?

182
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,238
Do you believe
in friendship among peoples?

183
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,837
I couldn't call you before. Thanks.

184
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,395
I'm working, dear.
Did you take your medicine?

185
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,713
- Are you alone with her?
- There are at least 50 people!

186
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:52,750
- Swear on your mother's life!
- Yes, I swear on my mother.

187
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,755
Beautiful
if you like American beauty.

188
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,434
She's like a big doll!

189
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,316
Yes.

190
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,077
I'll come there
and rip your eyes out!

191
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,119
Marcello, why don't you
come here immediately?

192
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,953
- I can't!
- I want to make love.

193
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,076
- Pardon me?
- I want to make love!

194
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,309
Where shall we take her?

195
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,358
First to St. Peter's,
then to the Quirinale.

196
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,196
Here's our Robert!

197
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,354
- Marcello?
- What! Are you going out today?

198
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,036
No, I'll wait for you
all day at home.

199
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:19,513
What would you like to eat?
Something light. You want ravioli?

200
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,989
I've got everything.
I'll just go down for vegetables.

201
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,390
Then we'll go to the movies.
Whatever you want.

202
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,436
Marcello, do you love me?

203
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,796
Don't leave her alone!

204
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,198
Wait, I take one more picture!

205
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,196
She never stops a minute!

206
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,798
I finished the film.
I'll be right back.

207
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,199
- Where did she go?
- She's an elevator!

208
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,237
Sylvia, you know you're everything?

209
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,676
You're the first woman of creation.

210
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,477
You're mother, sister,
lover, friend,

211
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,233
an angel, a devil,
the earth, the home.

212
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,278
Thas what you are: the home!

213
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,196
Why did you come here?

214
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,349
Go back to America, please.
What will I do now?

215
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,676
Our Robert is even a painter.
Bravo!

216
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,719
I must see you!
I must talk to you at all costs!

217
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,039
- Who's that idiot?
- Frankie Stout, a divine actor!

218
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,593
Please.

219
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,679
- Will you excuse me a moment?
- Go, honey, go!

220
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,316
He's dancing with the lady!

221
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,556
Hi, darling.

222
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,828
He's a good dancer, very good!

223
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,710
Banana flamb, huh?

224
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,872
- The lady's shoes.
- I'll take them, thank you.

225
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,838
- I found them...
- Thas fine, thank you.

226
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,593
Excuse me... one moment.

227
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,598
- What do you want?
- Some rock music!

228
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,392
Good! Bravo! Divine!

229
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,556
Good!

230
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,838
Thank you, madam.
You're divine!

231
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,876
Thank you, sir!

232
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,956
Marcello, open the champagne!

233
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,393
Thanks.

234
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,869
I don't know.
I'll bring her back immediately.

235
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,679
Give me the shoes.
I'll be right back.

236
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,355
- Why did she get upset?
- Stay here. I'll take care of it.

237
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,000
- Here she is!
- Sylvia! - Sylvia!

238
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,469
- Sylvia, the shoes!
- Marcello, what happened?

239
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,516
Nothing happened. Go away!

240
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,676
Marcello, wait!

241
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,356
Great idea, Marcello!

242
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,275
Paparazzo, get out of the car!

243
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,796
Incredible scoop.
I'll give you 50 percent.

244
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,829
I don't give a damn
about the 50 percent. Get out!

245
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,553
Get lost!

246
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,837
Marcello,
tell me where you're going!

247
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,876
Hurry. Les follow them!

248
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,796
We lost them.

249
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,556
Yes... no... of course!

250
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,676
What?

251
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,836
Is full of holes there!

252
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,596
We'd better leave.

253
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,793
Sergio will be back on the 12th.
I'm his mother.

254
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,476
- Do you have the studio key?
- No, he takes it with him.

255
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,790
I'm his mother. Was it for work?

256
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,351
Yes, for work...

257
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,352
I'll call on the 12th.
It doesn't matter.

258
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,396
Excuse me, madam. Goodnight.

259
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,878
- Excuse me, isn't she
the American actress? - Yes.

260
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,916
- How beautiful!
- Goodnight.

261
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:11,832
I can't bring you home.
The madwoman wouldn't understand.

262
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,876
Un-der-stand?

263
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,716
Wait. I've got an idea!

264
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,117
- Miss, a phone call for you.
- Hello?

265
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,673
Marcello! Sure you don't have
the wrong number?

266
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,479
Can I come with someone?

267
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,394
Someone? Who?

268
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,436
Someone!

269
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,191
- You're not alone?
- I'm playing cards with my father.

270
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,954
- Your father's there?
- Tell me...

271
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,270
What do you want?

272
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,557
Nothing.
I'll call you soon. Goodnight.

273
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,956
Sylvia, what are you doing?

274
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,238
Where can I find milk
at this hour?

275
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,156
Sylvia!
Where are you going with that cat?

276
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,993
Come here. Stop!

277
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,191
Come on!

278
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,829
I'll go get the milk.
Wait in the car.

279
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,638
I'm going... go!

280
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,708
Excuse me,
where can I buy some milk?

281
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,756
It doesn't matter...

282
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,436
Yes, I'm coming too...

283
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,036
I'm coming too!

284
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,556
Yes, you're right.
I'm making a mistake.

285
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,596
We're making a mistake!

286
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,636
Sylvia, who are you?

287
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,877
Turn him...

288
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,194
And to think he did Tarzan.

289
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,236
Put him back.

290
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,797
I'll take this one from the mirror.

291
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,838
I'll take one
while you're photographing him.

292
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,676
Here's Marcello!

293
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,676
Hey, wake up!

294
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,431
- Do me a favour. Leave!
- But I've got to work!

295
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,476
Enough!

296
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,276
Enough!

297
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,438
This will end up in a fight!

298
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,119
Follow her, Mr. Robert!

299
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,676
Is not over yet.

300
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,190
Marcello, hit him too, no?

301
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,955
Marcello, raise your head a bit!

302
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,635
Mr. Robert, where are you going?
Marcello, what happened?

303
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,869
Marcello!
Is done. Now what do I do?

304
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,989
Put the horse on the table,
and her on the ground.

305
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:05,836
- I'll be right back. - Are you
coming out with me tonight?

306
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,516
I thought I saw you enter. How are
you? What are you doing here?

307
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,149
And you?
I'm happy to see you again.

308
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,236
I'm at home here.

309
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:41,229
Father Franz found this book for me.

310
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,675
Is an old Sanskrit grammar book.

311
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,076
How long! How's your book?

312
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,516
Is going.
I finished gathering the material.

313
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,036
I thought I'd let you read it.
And you?

314
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,078
I liked your recent
article very much.

315
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:05,113
- No.
- Why? It was fine.

316
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,598
It was vivid, passionate...
the best of you.

317
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,990
A quality you insist on hiding.

318
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,878
I don't think I know how to write.

319
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,919
Why don't you come
some evening to see me?

320
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,599
- Can you stay another
five minutes? - Sure.

321
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,277
- Father, can I come up
with a friend? - Yes. Come on!

322
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,158
- Are you sure?
- Come on!

323
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:39,678
As you see,
these priests don't fear the devil.

324
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,718
They even let me play the organ.

325
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,710
Don't be too noisy.

326
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:50,271
Don't worry.
You'll hear some jazz at the most.

327
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,715
If is jazz, I like it.

328
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,676
Sorry, I won't do it again.

329
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,836
You want to try, Marcello?

330
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,072
We're not used to hearing it.
Anymore.

331
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,233
Mysterious voice. It seems
to come from inside the earth.

332
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,278
- What song?
- You choose?

333
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,318
Where is it?
At the end of a wall?

334
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,391
Hey, paparazzo!

335
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,438
They told me at the 47th kilometre.

336
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,993
- I don't want an egg at this hour!
- Eat it.

337
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,036
- No!
- Eat it!

338
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,190
- Chew slowly!
- Yes.

339
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,638
We shoulve come yesterday.
Ill be full of photographers.

340
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:02,669
- Do you have some coffee?
- Marcello needs it!

341
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,754
I don't want a banana!

342
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,798
- I don't want it!
- Eat it!

343
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,516
- Chew slowly!
- Yes!

344
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,996
- The Madonna's children?
- Yes!

345
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:30,349
- Where is the miracle tree?
- Over there!

346
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,476
Stay here.
There's too much confusion.

347
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,789
Norman! Stay here! Norman!

348
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,156
Where are the children?

349
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,708
Locked up
in the carabineers' headquarters.

350
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:13,112
Take me with you.
I'll tell you about the Communists.

351
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,159
- Where is the miracle tree?
- Over there.

352
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:25,149
Damned them!
Damned them!

353
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,073
Free those creatures.
Is an abuse!

354
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,355
- Where?
- This way!

355
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,000
- Where are the children?
- I don't know.

356
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,038
- Where is the marshal?
- Who knows.

357
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,432
What about the 500 lira that you
received by that journalist?

358
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,910
Can I go home, brigadier?

359
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,191
I'll feel shaky
the rest of my life!

360
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,236
Yes, I understand...

361
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,876
Look over there.

362
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,110
The grandfather's here too!

363
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,670
- What are the children's names?
- Dario... - Pardon me?

364
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,593
- Dario and Maria.
- Dario and Maria. Great!

365
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,272
Good, cry!

366
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:47,399
Is a miracle.
The Madonna remembers everyone!

367
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:51,314
- Do I look good like this?
- You're perfect!

368
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,358
- The cigar?
- Sing first.

369
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,152
- Then is not a miracle?
- I don't believe it.

370
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:07,190
The Lord can do it anywhere,
but they are very rare events.

371
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,636
Those youngsters aren't honest.

372
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,840
Who sees the Madonna
doesn't speculate on her!

373
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:21,711
Miracles are born out of silence
not in this confusion!

374
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:27,360
- Who did you see next to the tree?
- The Madonna.

375
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,273
- Who saw her first?
- I did! - I did!

376
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:35,354
- Simultaneously!
- No, he saw her first!

377
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,396
They are my nephews.

378
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,554
The Madonna looked at us and smiled.
Her feet didn't touch the ground.

379
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,677
Did she tell you
she was the Madonna?

380
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,797
They don't want to believe it!

381
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,189
Could it really
have been the Madonna?

382
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,236
It doesn't matter.

383
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,556
What do you mean?
Why do you say that?

384
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,631
Yes, it doesn't matter.

385
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:04,840
Your Italy is filled
with supernatural forces.

386
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,639
Everyone feels their influence.

387
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,757
He who looks for God,
finds him where he wants.

388
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,990
Did you come for a miracle too?

389
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:17,631
No, I'm with my fiance.
He's a journalist.

390
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,551
All these people frighten me.

391
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,596
You stay here. And don't laugh!

392
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:32,036
Higher!

393
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,590
I made a mistake.
Get down!

394
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,989
Les try the children's scene!

395
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:43,154
The children are smaller.
Can you see me?

396
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,515
Come on! Hurry up!

397
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,396
Hurry up!

398
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,476
- Here's my fiance.
- Fine. - I'll be right back.

399
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,596
Ready? Go!

400
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:01,638
Speak up!
Why don't you pray?

401
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,629
Is 7 p.m.
We'll meet in 2 hours.

402
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,474
Thank you.
See you this evening.

403
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:31,191
Holy Madonna,
make this creature get well.

404
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,238
I ask you with all my soul!

405
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,316
Marcello...

406
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,718
Don't worry.
The Madonna hears us. She's good!

407
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,396
A large crowd
has gathered in this area.

408
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,313
Many are believers,
many are curious.

409
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,790
Among the curious,
journalists, photo reporters

410
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,156
from papers all over the world.

411
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,312
There is an innumerable number
of cars piled up.

412
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:46,076
The weather is nice
after so much rain.

413
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,038
The two children
are still held by the police.

414
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:52,032
We await further word from Rome.

415
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:55,715
We're interviewing
the children's uncle.

416
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:02,148
The first time they saw...
the miracle?

417
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:10,750
They first saw the Madonna
on March 15 of... next year.

418
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,912
- You mean this year.
- This year.

419
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,231
Permission from Rome arrived.
The children are coming!

420
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:22,314
- Really? - Yes, they are coming.
- The children are coming!

421
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,791
- Stay here... I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

422
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,996
- I'm going up there.
- I'm coming too.

423
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,834
No, stay here with the lady.

424
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,756
Stay here.

425
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,870
Marcello, get down!

426
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,110
I just came up!

427
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,236
I'm coming up too.

428
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,149
Marcello,
why did you change so much?

429
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,475
Why don't you love me anymore?

430
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,951
Holy Madonna, if only he married me,

431
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:39,828
I'd come here on foot
every day to thank you.

432
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,388
I'm not asking you that.

433
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,552
I'd like him to be mine
as he was once.

434
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,596
Here they are!

435
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:54,189
Here they are!
As soon as they arrive, take shots.

436
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,640
Wait for my sign!

437
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:37,276
Hi, darling, how are you?
Focus on them and then on the crowd.

438
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,716
My wife is there too.

439
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,598
Sometimes she makes me so upset,
and sometimes...

440
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,956
Calm down... keep calm.

441
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,276
One at a time.

442
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,675
- Is raining.
- Is dangerous.

443
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:36,639
Water makes lights have short
circuits. Shut everything off!

444
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,873
We took shelter in the bus
because it started to rain again.

445
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,636
The Madonna is over there!

446
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,198
The children are getting up.

447
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,555
They're running
in the opposite direction.

448
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,835
They cry out
that they see the Madonna.

449
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,150
The wild crowd is following them.

450
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,190
They're headed to another area!

451
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,596
There she is!

452
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:35,597
They'll catch pneumonia!

453
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:43,111
She said if you don't build a church
here she won't come anymore.

454
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:48,320
She said if you don't build a church
here she won't come anymore.

455
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,437
Good night. Go home!

456
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,998
Leave me!

457
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:06,390
- Paparazzo, stop it!
- Thas a nice shot!

458
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:11,076
Leave me!
Is impossible to be like you!

459
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:17,508
You're worse than hyenas!
You don't respect anyone! Slimes!

460
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,196
Alfonso!

461
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:52,312
Alfonso!

462
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:35,519
Good evening, I'm Steiner's wife.
We were waiting for you.

463
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,630
Good evening, Marcello.
How are you?

464
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,314
Good. What a lovely home!

465
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:59,871
This is Emma.
I've been wanting to meet you.

466
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:04,511
- Thanks for coming.
- I'll be right back. - Come here!

467
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,478
- Hi, Anna, how are you?
- Did you finish your book?

468
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,279
- This is Margherita. You know
her paintings? - Of course.

469
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,830
You didn't even come
to my exhibition!

470
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,869
She's an admirer of your writings
but she doesn't speak Italian.

471
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,316
- She said you're very decorative.
- She's right.

472
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,195
I think I know you well.

473
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:33,678
When you understand that you love
Marcello more than he does...

474
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,716
you'll be happy.

475
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,518
The only real woman
is the oriental one.

476
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:48,434
Where was Eve?
In the Garden of Eden!

477
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:51,273
Where was the Garden of Eden?
In the orient!

478
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:55,239
- There is love there!
- Why did you marry me?

479
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,390
I made a big mistake!

480
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:01,519
Mysterious, motherly,
both lover and daughter.

481
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:07,152
She huddles at your feet
like a tiger in love.

482
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,949
Why doesn't he stay in the Orient?

483
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,918
- Will you introduce Emma to me?
- Of course.

484
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,471
What a lovely face!
Don't lose hold of that guy!

485
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,235
I'm saying it in his interests,
naturally...

486
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:27,348
The Oriental submits
both her spirit and her flesh.

487
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:31,956
May I introduce Marcello
and his fiance?

488
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,510
I'm pleased to meet you.
I agree with your concept on women.

489
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,354
The Oriental woman
can teach us much!

490
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,431
She's remained close to nature,

491
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,557
the nature she conquered after
centuries of civilization.

492
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,916
What use is civilization to you?

493
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,470
You can't make love anymore!

494
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,915
Speak for yourself!

495
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,150
- Would you like something
to drink? - Yes, please.

496
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:00,836
I envy you:
I've read all your stories.

497
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:06,552
I'd like to travel too,
meet women of all races.

498
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,792
I'd like to have children
of all colours: red, yellow...

499
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,395
- Like a bouquet of country flowers.
- You can't say anything else!

500
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,755
You must have incredible memories.

501
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:22,153
Memories?
Above all, I have projects!

502
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:26,028
- What a magnificent creature!
Are you his fiance? - Yes.

503
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,111
Are you from the South?

504
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,156
What an extraordinary person!

505
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,800
He's written many important books

506
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,519
and has maintained
a childish candour.

507
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,513
I wonder
where he finds so much optimism.

508
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,637
I always watch him with stupor.

509
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:45,598
At times maybe I envy him.

510
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:49,958
I see that you have
a beautiful Morandi.

511
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,270
Yes, he's my favourite painter.

512
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,238
The objects are flooded with light

513
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:59,996
and yet painted with detachment,
precision, rigour...

514
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:04,915
Is an art
where nothing is coincidental.

515
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,356
Steiner said
that you have two loves,

516
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,829
and you don't know
which one to choose.

517
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:15,277
Journalism or literature.
Look out for prisons!

518
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,193
Stay free, available, like me.

519
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:23,119
Never get married. Never choose.

520
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,158
Even in love,
is better to be chosen.

521
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:34,840
I read your poetry. I like it.
Is strong, precise.

522
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,911
It doesn't look like
a woman's writing.

523
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,355
What do you know about women?

524
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:43,789
Is the art I prefer.

525
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:50,115
A clear, crystal art
that doesn't lie and tempt.

526
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:55,035
I work at a job I don't like now,
but I'm thinking about tomorrow.

527
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:58,795
Les not forget to live today!

528
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:05,038
I think if a person lives
intensively in fullness of spirit

529
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:09,671
he gets younger every year!

530
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:20,269
- You're a prophet tonight!
- An alcoholic prophet!

531
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,678
Friends, you think too much
about the future.

532
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:28,753
But you seem so different.
What do you do?

533
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,196
What do you like to do most?

534
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,080
I don't know. And you?

535
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:42,679
I like the three big evasions:
drinking, smoking, and going to bed.

536
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:47,709
- Such wisdom!
- You never understood me.

537
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:52,715
You are a true primitive,
as primitive as a gothic spire.

538
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:57,510
You're so tall you can't hear
any voices up there!

539
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,071
If you could see my real height...
I'm not taller than this.

540
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,236
<i>As primitive as a gothic spire. </i>

541
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:19,075
<i>You're so tall you can't hear</i>
<i>any voices up there! </i>

542
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:23,711
<i>If you could see my real height... </i>
<i>I'm not taller than this. </i>

543
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:32,710
Is an old recording.
I'll shut it off.

544
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,031
Why, can't we hear it?

545
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,998
I don't want to bore you.

546
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,640
They're nature sounds he's recorded.

547
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:45,349
- Play them again, please.
- No. - Please.

548
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,000
If they don't interest you,
why did you record them?

549
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,914
I thought they were beautiful.
Do you really want to hear them?

550
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,959
- I already know how interesting
they are. - As you wish.

551
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,316
Birds!

552
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,636
Thas exactly the way they sound.

553
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,516
This is a forest.

554
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,358
What are you doing here?

555
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:56,152
- Why did you get out of bed?
- You'll get a cold!

556
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,595
Your storm woke him up.

557
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:05,714
- Did you want one more kiss?
- Dad, you've got a huge head!

558
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:11,716
A huge head?!
Everyone knows now!

559
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,756
Such lovely children!

560
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,428
- Such intelligent eyes!
- Yes, is true.

561
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,829
When one says something
that catches his interest

562
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:25,471
first he thinks about it, seriously,
then he laughs cheerfully.

563
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:30,789
If you give him a flower,
first he looks at it,

564
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,031
then laughs because he understands
that is beautiful.

565
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:37,908
The way you smile
when you listen to music.

566
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,199
Now back to sleep!
Then I'll come say goodnight.

567
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,829
- Say goodnight to everyone.
- Goodnight.

568
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:52,631
The girl is different.
She likes combinations of words.

569
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,915
A new phrase enchants her.

570
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,913
At times she invents them.
I noted some of them.

571
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,198
For example:
"Who is the sun's mother?".
