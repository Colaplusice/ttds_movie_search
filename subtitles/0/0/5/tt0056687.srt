00:00:09.00,00:00:12.10
Want to see it again, little girl?[br]It shouldn't frighten you.

00:00:30.70,00:00:33.90
I'm sorry. Nothing until[br]matinee tomorrow.

00:00:45.10,00:00:46.90
Lady,[br]would ya mind takin' off your hat?

00:00:47.00,00:00:48.20
Excuse me.

00:01:00.20,00:01:02.60
Atta girl, Janey. Show 'em how!

00:01:29.50,00:01:32.40
Oh, thank you, folks.[br]Thank you very much, thank you...

00:01:34.70,00:01:36.40
One final request, all right?

00:01:44.20,00:01:45.80
"I've Written a Letter to Daddy!"

00:01:46.50,00:01:48.70
All right, thank you.

00:01:49.50,00:01:51.40
"I've Written a Letter to Daddy."

00:02:09.40,00:02:15.00
"I've written a letter to Daddy.

00:02:16.10,00:02:21.30
"His address is heaven above.

00:02:22.30,00:02:28.00
"I've written, Dear Daddy,[br]we miss you...

00:02:28.70,00:02:34.30
"...and wish you were with us to love.

00:02:35.20,00:02:40.00
"Instead of a stamp I put kisses.

00:02:41.60,00:02:47.30
"The postman says that's best to do.

00:02:48.10,00:02:52.80
"I've written this letter to Daddy...

00:02:53.40,00:02:59.30
"...saying, I love you.

00:03:21.80,00:03:26.90
"I've written a letter to Daddy...

00:03:27.50,00:03:34.40
"...saying, I love you!"

00:03:52.30,00:03:53.70
Well, what do you have here?

00:03:54.60,00:03:55.70
All for you.

00:03:56.00,00:03:58.20
Jane, isn't that a beautiful doll?

00:03:58.50,00:04:00.30
Thank you, young man,[br]that's a gorgeous doll!

00:04:00.50,00:04:03.70
Folks, have you ever seen[br]such a lovely doll?

00:04:15.60,00:04:17.80
Don't forget, there's a genuine...

00:04:17.90,00:04:20.70
...Baby Jane doll waiting for each and[br]every one of you right out in the foyer.

00:04:20.90,00:04:23.80
All you have to do is go out there[br]and collect it. And kids, remember...

00:04:24.00,00:04:26.80
...you can tell your moms that[br]each and everyone of these...

00:04:27.00,00:04:29.10
...genuine, beautiful, great[br]big dolls...

00:04:29.40,00:04:33.50
...is an exact replica of your own[br]Baby Jane Hudson.

00:04:37.00,00:04:39.80
Baby Jane dolls.[br]Only $3.25.

00:04:53.90,00:04:57.00
I won't, I don't wanna[br]go back to that ol' hotel!

00:04:57.40,00:05:00.00
I don't have to take a nap[br]and you can't make me!

00:05:00.10,00:05:01.60
Now, Jane, don't act up, sweetheart.

00:05:01.70,00:05:03.40
You've got to take your nap.[br]You know that.

00:05:03.50,00:05:06.00
No, I don't know and I'm not going to!

00:05:07.00,00:05:09.10
You don't want all these[br]nice friends of yours out here...

00:05:09.20,00:05:11.30
...to think that you're[br]a bad little girl, do ya?

00:05:11.30,00:05:14.30
I don't care! I want an ice cream!

00:05:14.40,00:05:16.70
Janey, I told you...

00:05:16.70,00:05:19.90
I make the money,[br]so I can have what I want!

00:05:21.40,00:05:23.10
Leave me alone! I need an ice cream!

00:05:25.30,00:05:26.80
Well, if you need an ice cream...

00:05:27.30,00:05:28.80
...I guess you better have some.

00:05:28.90,00:05:30.70
I mean, it's pretty hot and all.

00:05:30.90,00:05:33.20
But remember, this is[br]the last time this week.

00:05:33.70,00:05:37.50
All right, Daddy.[br]Blanche wants some, too.

00:05:37.80,00:05:39.60
We gotta have some[br]ice cream for Blanche.

00:05:42.40,00:05:43.80
I don't want anything.

00:05:44.20,00:05:46.00
What do you think you're tryin' to do?!

00:05:46.30,00:05:48.90
I always said it's the parents' fault[br]in cases like this.

00:05:49.30,00:05:50.90
I'm really disappointed!

00:05:51.50,00:05:53.90
It sure is a hot day today.

00:06:08.00,00:06:10.50
You're the lucky one, though,[br]Blanche, really you are.

00:06:10.80,00:06:13.60
Someday it's going to be you[br]that's getting all the attention.

00:06:13.90,00:06:15.40
And when that happens, I...

00:06:17.40,00:06:19.70
...I want you to try to be kinder[br]to Jane and your father...

00:06:19.80,00:06:21.80
...than they are to you now.

00:06:23.90,00:06:25.40
You know what I mean?

00:06:29.00,00:06:31.60
I hope you'll try'n remember that.

00:06:32.70,00:06:34.50
I won't forget.

00:06:34.90,00:06:37.20
You bet I won't forget!

00:06:44.30,00:06:45.80
The Seltzer Agency sent you?

00:06:46.80,00:06:48.60
Think there's any chance for me?

00:06:48.70,00:06:51.30
There's a chance if Mr. Weber likes you.

00:06:51.80,00:06:53.60
What type does he like?

00:06:55.70,00:06:57.10
A lot of personality.

00:06:58.10,00:07:00.60
I'll catch on, watch me.

00:07:03.10,00:07:05.10
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

00:07:08.00,00:07:11.00
With my money[br]I should make a picture like that, huh?

00:07:14.30,00:07:16.50
Good morning, Mr. Weber.[br]I'm Ms. Brent.

00:07:16.60,00:07:18.90
Yes. Won't you come a little closer,[br]please?

00:07:19.00,00:07:22.00
She's got a southern accent[br]like I got a southern accent.

00:07:26.90,00:07:30.10
I know it's 11:00![br]I'll be there when I get there!

00:07:34.30,00:07:35.80
Gardner is here to see you.

00:07:36.00,00:07:38.00
Gardner?

00:07:38.10,00:07:39.10
I'll come out.

00:07:40.20,00:07:41.90
I'll be right back, Ms. Brent.

00:07:41.90,00:07:43.70
Have yourself a cigarette.

00:07:43.80,00:07:44.90
Make yourself at home.

00:07:44.90,00:07:46.50
Then the job is mine?

00:07:46.90,00:07:48.10
Need you ask?

00:08:26.30,00:08:27.30
Kill it!

00:08:31.10,00:08:33.00
What do you think, Ben?

00:08:33.60,00:08:36.00
What's thinking got to do with it, huh?

00:08:36.90,00:08:39.00
She stinks, doesn't she?

00:08:39.80,00:08:43.00
They say the end's pretty good.[br]Maybe we should've seen it through.

00:08:44.80,00:08:47.40
You gonna want that picture[br]again today, Mr. Feldman?

00:08:49.40,00:08:53.50
I don't think anybody's ever gonna want[br]that picture again!

00:09:00.30,00:09:02.50
When the old man hired them[br]Hudson sisters...

00:09:02.80,00:09:05.30
...how come he had to hire[br]the back end of the act, too?

00:09:05.50,00:09:08.10
Boy, what a no-talent broad[br]that Baby Jane is!

00:09:08.40,00:09:10.70
Why can't she stay sober?

00:09:12.20,00:09:15.20
Jane's got her pride.[br]She's a very sensitive girl.

00:09:15.50,00:09:19.00
Your "very sensitive girl" guzzled[br]her way through six cases of Scotch...

00:09:19.30,00:09:20.80
...and slugged two studio cops.

00:09:20.90,00:09:24.20
Not to mention one or two other[br]less savory items of publicity...

00:09:24.50,00:09:26.50
...before we got that so-called[br]epic in the can.

00:09:26.80,00:09:28.50
Anyway, you don't have to talk to Jane.

00:09:28.80,00:09:31.10
If Blanche will only let us out[br]of that clause in the contract...

00:09:31.10,00:09:33.40
...which says that we have to make[br]a picture with Baby Jane...

00:09:33.50,00:09:35.30
...for every picture that we make[br]with Blanche.

00:09:35.40,00:09:37.50
Then Baby Jane's contract[br]won't be any problem.

00:09:37.80,00:09:39.70
You see, that's what we pay lawyers for.

00:09:39.80,00:09:40.70
Possibly.

00:09:40.90,00:09:44.10
But somehow,[br]I can't see Blanche doing that.

00:09:44.30,00:09:45.40
You know, I don't get it!

00:09:45.50,00:09:47.40
Blanche Hudson's the biggest thing[br]in movies today.

00:09:47.60,00:09:50.10
She can write her own ticket.[br]She's got a script approval.

00:09:50.30,00:09:52.70
She's got more money than she knows[br]what to do with...

00:09:54.10,00:09:57.80
You know, she just bought that[br]tremendous place Valentino used to have.

00:09:57.80,00:09:59.20
It's gonna take her a year[br]to fix it up...

00:09:59.40,00:10:01.80
...the way she wants it[br]before they move in.

00:10:02.00,00:10:05.40
Well I guess they can manage[br]to struggle on where they are now.

00:10:05.50,00:10:07.60
But, my point is she ought to have[br]sense enough to know that...

00:10:07.70,00:10:11.40
...she can't make a star[br]out of Baby Jane again.

00:10:11.50,00:10:14.60
Blanche doesn't have[br]any illusions like that.

00:10:15.30,00:10:18.50
But she's a very fine person, Ben.

00:10:18.80,00:10:20.90
She's never gonna forget[br]those early years.

00:10:21.20,00:10:23.20
What her sister did for her.[br]She told me that herself.

00:10:23.30,00:10:27.30
Well, I tell you, she's not doin'[br]Baby Jane any favor.

00:10:27.50,00:10:30.50
Someday, sooner or later,[br]that girl's gonna end up in a home.

00:10:32.90,00:10:35.20
Look, you're going to their party[br]at the Grove tonight, aren't you?

00:10:35.80,00:10:39.10
Did you ever try refusing[br]one of Blanche's invitations?

00:10:39.40,00:10:41.70
Do me a favor, Marty, will ya?[br]You talk to Blanche.

00:10:42.00,00:10:44.00
Try to make her understand, huh?

00:10:44.70,00:10:46.40
- Do my best.[br]- Thanks...

00:10:48.20,00:10:50.50
Remind me to send you[br]one of those...

00:10:50.60,00:10:53.00
...Baby Jane dolls for Christmas.

00:10:54.10,00:10:56.10
I've got mine for this year.

00:10:58.00,00:10:59.90
I don't get it, Marty.

00:11:00.40,00:11:02.60
What do they make monsters[br]like this for?

00:11:02.90,00:11:04.70
For Blanche Hudson.

00:11:08.30,00:11:10.50
That's our problem.

00:14:59.90,00:15:01.60
You go to bed!

00:15:10.90,00:15:13.00
- Hi, Mom![br]- Oh, hi, dear.

00:15:26.00,00:15:27.30
Hello, beautiful![br]How 'bout a little souvenir?

00:15:27.30,00:15:28.70
Let go of that, will ya, let go!

00:15:29.20,00:15:31.50
Come on, don't be like that.[br]Who do you think you are?

00:15:34.90,00:15:35.90
Thanks.

00:15:42.60,00:15:44.50
Isn't she great?

00:15:45.80,00:15:49.10
Sorry to break in on this fine old[br]Blanche Hudson movie, folks.

00:15:49.40,00:15:50.90
But you'll be glad I did...

00:15:51.00,00:15:52.70
...when you see what I have[br]right here...

00:15:52.80,00:15:55.00
...for that favorite pooch of yours.

00:15:55.10,00:15:56.60
And Iliad means quality.

00:15:57.20,00:16:01.00
So when your dog says, "woof woof"...

00:16:01.00,00:16:02.90
...feed him Iliad,[br]the classic dog food.

00:16:02.90,00:16:04.20
Oh, shut up!

00:16:04.70,00:16:06.30
Iliad will bring the sheen[br]back to your dog's coat...

00:16:06.40,00:16:09.50
Oh, my goodness, I remember[br]the first time I saw that picture.

00:16:09.70,00:16:12.10
I thought it was just wonderful.

00:16:12.60,00:16:13.40
When was that?

00:16:14.00,00:16:18.20
Let's see now, as I recall, your father[br]took me to see it at the old Majestic.

00:16:18.40,00:16:20.30
It was before we were married.

00:16:20.60,00:16:24.10
She must be about 150 by now!

00:16:25.70,00:16:27.70
As a matter of fact, dear,[br]I think Blanche Hudson is...

00:16:27.80,00:16:29.50
...just a few years older than I am.

00:16:30.30,00:16:31.10
Really?!

00:16:31.20,00:16:33.30
Yes, dear, "really."

00:16:33.60,00:16:35.90
Well, how come[br]we never see her around?

00:16:36.30,00:16:38.90
We've been living next door to them[br]for six months now...

00:16:39.10,00:16:42.40
...and the only one I ever see[br]is that fat sister slouching around.

00:16:42.60,00:16:44.60
Don't they ever have company?

00:16:44.80,00:16:46.20
I mean it must be awful.

00:16:46.50,00:16:50.80
You know, Julie says[br]that sister's kind of peculiar.

00:16:51.10,00:16:52.40
Did you ever notice that?

00:16:52.70,00:16:54.30
No, I never have.

00:16:55.10,00:16:56.60
Well, that's what Julie told me.

00:16:56.70,00:16:59.30
She said that she was supposed[br]to be responsible for the accident...

00:16:59.50,00:17:01.70
...that crippled her sister Blanche.

00:17:02.00,00:17:04.90
That all happened[br]a very long time ago, dear.

00:17:05.00,00:17:06.70
And maybe you shouldn't[br]pay too much attention...

00:17:06.80,00:17:08.10
...to everything that Julie Fowler[br]tells you.

00:17:08.20,00:17:10.90
There's too many people in this town[br]with nothing else to do but talk.

00:17:11.20,00:17:14.30
Maybe so, but Julie's folks[br]have lived here a long time.

00:17:14.50,00:17:16.00
I guess she should know.

00:17:16.30,00:17:19.00
Turn up the volume, dear.[br]We're missing the picture.

00:17:20.90,00:17:23.20
- Will you have a little champagne?[br]- No, thank you.

00:17:26.20,00:17:28.40
You wanna tell Poppa your troubles?

00:17:29.90,00:17:31.20
Somebody you love?

00:17:32.10,00:17:35.10
Oh, Jack, please try to understand.

00:17:35.40,00:17:36.90
I married you because...

00:17:37.20,00:17:40.40
...I was knocked silly[br]and it was a refuge.

00:17:41.70,00:17:45.60
I found out tonight that this boy's[br]in trouble, maybe alone.

00:17:46.20,00:17:48.00
It's blinding me.

00:17:48.50,00:17:50.40
I can't think of anything else...

00:17:52.70,00:17:54.30
Oh! He should've held that shot...

00:17:54.40,00:17:55.40
...Ionger.

00:17:55.80,00:17:59.40
I told him that when we were rehearsing,[br]also when it was shot!

00:17:59.70,00:18:00.80
But he wouldn't listen!

00:18:08.10,00:18:10.40
- Hiya?[br]- Swell.

00:18:12.30,00:18:14.60
It's still a pretty good picture.

00:18:16.80,00:18:19.00
...and Gemini...

00:18:59.60,00:19:02.00
Tommy, you don't have to stay here,[br]do you?

00:19:03.60,00:19:05.40
I'll just sit here.

00:19:07.00,00:19:09.10
Enjoying yourself?

00:19:09.40,00:19:11.60
Jane, what are you doing?

00:19:13.40,00:19:14.70
I was watching!

00:19:16.10,00:19:17.10
Then you're an idiot!

00:19:17.80,00:19:20.50
I won't have you speak to me like that!

00:19:29.80,00:19:31.60
Ah, the poor thing!

00:19:33.10,00:19:35.50
Poor baby.

00:19:38.50,00:19:40.30
Quiet down.

00:20:03.30,00:20:06.40
Oh, good morning, Ms. Hudson.[br]I hope I'm not intruding.

00:20:06.90,00:20:09.30
I just couldn't resist cutting[br]these flowers for your sister...

00:20:09.50,00:20:11.70
...after seeing her show yesterday.

00:20:12.70,00:20:15.00
You must be very proud[br]of her new success...

00:20:15.30,00:20:17.10
...on television, I mean.

00:20:19.80,00:20:21.40
I can't tell you how nice it is...

00:20:21.50,00:20:23.90
...to be seeing all of[br]her old pictures like this.

00:20:24.50,00:20:26.00
I'll tell 'er you said so.

00:20:27.60,00:20:31.70
You know, my daughter and I[br]would just love to meet her one day.

00:20:31.80,00:20:32.80
Perhaps she could...

00:20:33.40,00:20:35.20
Mrs. Bates,[br]my sister doesn't ever go out.

00:20:35.30,00:20:38.40
She's not fit to receive visitors.

00:20:39.00,00:20:41.20
Oh, I am sorry to hear that.

00:20:41.70,00:20:43.80
I'd no idea that, well...

00:20:46.90,00:20:49.30
I hope she likes the flowers.

00:20:53.20,00:20:54.60
Thanks.

00:21:18.30,00:21:20.90
You miserable...

00:22:02.80,00:22:03.80
Oh, Jane, I'm sorry.

00:22:04.00,00:22:06.00
I didn't mean to ring for my breakfast.

00:22:06.40,00:22:09.00
I was just wondering who all those[br]people were at the back door.

00:22:09.50,00:22:11.30
Wasn't anything.

00:22:11.60,00:22:15.20
Just that nosey Mrs. Bates going on[br]about your picture last night.

00:22:16.10,00:22:18.30
Oh, really? Did she like it?

00:22:18.90,00:22:21.60
Oh, really? Did she like it?

00:22:24.00,00:22:25.90
She liked it.

00:22:28.60,00:22:30.60
I remember, when it first came out...

00:22:30.80,00:22:33.30
...it had a tremendous reception.

00:22:34.00,00:22:37.60
The critics described it as... brilliant!

00:22:38.40,00:22:41.40
Do you remember what year[br]you made that picture?

00:22:42.90,00:22:46.10
Well, of course, you must, too.[br]In 1934, right after I did "Moonglow."

00:22:46.60,00:22:49.10
I made a picture that year, too!

00:22:50.10,00:22:53.80
Oh, yes, it was that comedy[br]directed by Lloyd, wasn't it?

00:22:54.50,00:22:56.60
No, it wasn't. It was a love story.

00:22:56.80,00:22:58.20
"The Longest Night."

00:22:58.50,00:23:00.70
Marty McDonald said[br]it was the best thing I ever did!

00:23:02.30,00:23:05.40
They never even released it[br]in the United States!

00:23:06.90,00:23:08.20
Feldman was very upset.

00:23:08.30,00:23:09.80
He told me the company had...

00:23:09.90,00:23:11.70
...a very bad year and[br]they couldn't afford...

00:23:11.70,00:23:12.80
No, they didn't![br]They had a great year!

00:23:12.90,00:23:14.60
They didn't want to show my films.

00:23:15.30,00:23:17.60
They were too busy[br]giving a "big build-up"...

00:23:17.80,00:23:20.30
...to that crap you were turning out.

00:23:24.20,00:23:25.30
I'll clean the cage.

00:23:29.20,00:23:30.50
Oh, that would be Elvira.

00:24:04.70,00:24:05.80
Come in, Elvira!

00:24:07.90,00:24:10.20
- How are you today?[br]- Fine.

00:24:11.00,00:24:12.80
Oh, you've seen Jane.

00:24:15.00,00:24:17.10
I don't think she's feeling[br]very well today.

00:24:17.30,00:24:20.70
Did you speak to that Dr. Shelby[br]about Ms. Jane like you said?

00:24:21.30,00:24:24.20
No, I haven't yet.[br]It's rather difficult.

00:24:24.40,00:24:26.90
I don't want to upset her again,[br]if I can help it.

00:24:27.20,00:24:29.00
But she'll be upset anyway,[br]Ms. Blanche.

00:24:29.20,00:24:32.10
And the longer you leave it,[br]the worse it's gonna be.

00:24:32.90,00:24:33.90
I know.

00:24:34.90,00:24:37.80
But I was just hoping[br]it wouldn't be necessary.

00:24:38.30,00:24:40.80
I think she seems much better lately.

00:24:41.10,00:24:42.50
It's none of my business...

00:24:42.60,00:24:45.00
...but she's been drinkin' again.[br]You know that, don't ya?

00:24:45.20,00:24:47.20
No, I hadn't noticed.

00:24:48.90,00:24:51.40
Oh, I don't think[br]it does her any real harm.

00:24:51.60,00:24:53.60
I think I understand her.

00:24:53.90,00:24:55.00
Oh, you do, huh?

00:24:55.30,00:24:57.40
Well, then, you ought[br]to take a look at this.

00:25:02.00,00:25:03.10
What are these?

00:25:03.20,00:25:05.20
I guess it's what you'd call fan mail.

00:25:07.50,00:25:10.80
Oh, how kind people are.

00:25:11.50,00:25:12.70
You better look at them...

00:25:12.70,00:25:16.10
...and then you can tell me[br]whether or not you've seen them before.

00:25:16.50,00:25:18.10
- Did you read that?[br]- No.

00:25:19.20,00:25:20.40
But they've been opened.

00:25:20.50,00:25:22.10
That's right, they all have.

00:25:22.40,00:25:25.20
And there's one in here[br]marked "Personal."

00:25:31.90,00:25:35.80
"The other night my husband and I[br]watched that lovely movie of yours...

00:25:36.10,00:25:37.20
"...'Last Honeymoon.'

00:25:37.40,00:25:40.40
"I remember saying to my husband[br]at the time that seeing you again...

00:25:40.50,00:25:42.70
"...was just like[br]meeting an old friend."

00:25:43.80,00:25:47.10
Oh, that's charming.[br]That's really charming!

00:25:47.40,00:25:50.00
The point is, you never[br]saw them before, did you?

00:25:53.90,00:25:55.60
I thought not.

00:25:56.50,00:25:59.40
I'm sorry, I thought you ought to know.

00:26:00.00,00:26:02.80
But, I don't understand.

00:26:03.40,00:26:05.20
Where'd they come from?[br]Where'd you find them?

00:26:05.50,00:26:07.40
In the trash barrel, that's where!

00:26:07.60,00:26:09.10
They're from that television station...

00:26:09.20,00:26:11.20
...that's been running[br]your old movies, aren't they?

00:26:20.10,00:26:21.60
You mean Jane?

00:26:21.90,00:26:23.80
Who else?

00:26:25.10,00:26:27.50
Oh, well, she must have thought[br]they were advertisements.

00:26:27.70,00:26:30.00
Then why would she open[br]the one marked "Personal"?

00:26:30.20,00:26:33.20
And what about this?[br]You might as well see this, too.

00:26:35.10,00:26:36.80
Writing those dirty words!

00:26:37.10,00:26:41.30
I can even remember the last time[br]I saw words like that written down!

00:26:41.90,00:26:43.90
But, why would she do a thing like this?

00:26:44.30,00:26:46.40
You know what makes her[br]do things like this!

00:26:46.60,00:26:49.80
She's sick, and she's not[br]getting any better.

00:26:50.50,00:26:52.90
In fact, the last month[br]she's been getting a lot worse.

00:26:56.00,00:26:57.40
If you don't believe me, then...

00:26:57.50,00:27:00.40
...why are you selling this house[br]and planning to move out?

00:27:00.80,00:27:02.80
You said this last month...

00:27:03.50,00:27:05.20
...she's been a lot worse.

00:27:06.00,00:27:07.30
Do you think she knows?

00:27:07.60,00:27:09.00
About selling the house?

00:27:09.40,00:27:12.90
How could she?[br]You don't have anything in writing.

00:27:13.50,00:27:15.60
We're sisters, Elvira.

00:27:16.20,00:27:17.80
We know each other very well.

00:27:17.90,00:27:18.90
I think she's jealous...

00:27:19.00,00:27:22.90
...because of those old movies of yours[br]they're showing on television this week.

00:27:23.40,00:27:25.80
Anyway, in six weeks you'll have to[br]hand over the house and then...

00:27:26.00,00:27:27.70
...she'll have to know.

00:27:29.40,00:27:30.60
How do I tell her?

00:27:30.80,00:27:31.50
How?!

00:27:32.60,00:27:36.70
Well, if you'd just speak to that[br]Dr. Shelby, maybe he could tell her.

00:27:42.40,00:27:44.50
No, it ought to be me.

00:27:46.80,00:27:49.00
I can't let a stranger tell her.

00:27:49.30,00:27:52.90
But he's a doctor, Ms. Blanche.[br]And she's a sick woman.

00:27:53.70,00:27:57.80
Elvira, you didn't know her[br]when she was a child.

00:27:58.60,00:27:59.50
When she was young.

00:27:59.70,00:28:02.50
I've seen those pictures she keeps.

00:28:03.90,00:28:07.30
It wasn't that she was just pretty.

00:28:08.10,00:28:09.90
She was different.

00:28:10.00,00:28:11.70
She was so alive.

00:28:18.20,00:28:20.40
I was cleaning the cage.

00:28:21.10,00:28:22.30
The bird got out.

00:28:23.70,00:28:25.10
But where is it now?

00:28:25.60,00:28:27.40
It flew out the window.

00:28:28.50,00:28:31.10
You let that bird out[br]on purpose, Ms. Jane!

00:28:31.50,00:28:36.30
I just told ya, I was cleaning the cage[br]and the bird flew out the window.

00:28:38.40,00:28:39.70
I'm sorry!

00:28:40.50,00:28:44.50
She did that on purpose![br]Believe me, she did it on purpose!

00:28:44.80,00:28:46.10
Never mind.

00:28:46.90,00:28:48.30
Maybe he'll come back.

00:29:03.10,00:29:04.70
You won't change your mind, will you?

00:29:04.80,00:29:06.50
I mean about coming to live with me?

00:29:06.60,00:29:09.00
You know I don't go back[br]on my word, Ms. Blanche.

00:29:09.30,00:29:12.40
But you've got to make up your mind[br]about finding somewhere for Ms. Jane...

00:29:12.60,00:29:15.00
...where they can[br]look after her properly.

00:29:18.50,00:29:20.40
I have made up my mind.

00:29:21.10,00:29:23.40
I'm going to call Dr. Shelby today.

00:29:33.90,00:29:35.90
I know, Ms. Blanche, I know.

00:29:39.50,00:29:41.10
It's just that I have to be sure...

00:29:41.20,00:29:43.10
...I'm doing the right thing for her.

00:30:09.80,00:30:11.30
Hello, is this Johnson's?

00:30:12.20,00:30:14.70
I want to order some liquor.[br]It's Jane Hudson.

00:30:17.30,00:30:20.20
Waddaya mean you can't fill[br]any more orders for me?

00:30:21.00,00:30:22.70
My sister did?

00:30:29.10,00:30:32.70
Well, wait a minute,[br]I'll put 'er on.

00:30:35.10,00:30:39.40
Blanche, would you speak[br]to this man from Johnson's?

00:30:45.10,00:30:47.70
Hello, who is this, please?

00:30:49.70,00:30:52.90
Oh, yes, Mr. Carlston.

00:30:53.00,00:30:55.90
Yes, this is Blanche Hudson.[br]What seems to be the trouble?

00:31:00.50,00:31:03.70
I'm afraid there's been some[br]misunderstanding.

00:31:04.10,00:31:05.80
I certainly didn't mean to suggest...

00:31:06.10,00:31:09.00
...that you shouldn't fill[br]any orders for her.

00:31:11.30,00:31:13.70
After all, we do pay[br]our bills, don't we?

00:31:17.90,00:31:19.70
Yes, fine.

00:31:20.70,00:31:21.70
Would you please?

00:31:24.60,00:31:26.60
I'll put her on.

00:31:32.30,00:31:33.90
Okay, then?

00:31:34.90,00:31:35.60
Good...

00:31:35.60,00:31:40.10
...I'd like to order six bottles[br]of Scotch and three bottles of gin.

00:31:40.80,00:31:44.60
The same brands,[br]and as soon as possible.

00:31:53.60,00:31:58.40
I just told Ms. Blanche. I'm going[br]downtown to see a man about jury duty.

00:32:04.80,00:32:06.60
I'll be back tomorrow.

00:33:18.70,00:33:23.10
"I've written a letter to Daddy.

00:33:25.60,00:33:29.30
"His address is heaven above.

00:33:32.10,00:33:36.80
"I've written, Dear Daddy,[br]we miss you...

00:33:38.90,00:33:44.40
"...and wish you were with us to love.

00:33:45.30,00:33:50.20
"Instead of a stamp, I put kisses.

00:33:52.10,00:33:54.90
"The postman says...

"The postman says...

"...that's best to do.

"...I'm Mama's little angel.

"And Papa says I'm good as gold.

00:35:08.20,00:35:10.00
"But when I'm very bad...

00:35:11.30,00:35:13.50
"...and answer back and sass...

00:35:14.20,00:35:15.80
"...then I'm Mama's little devil.

00:35:16.60,00:35:19.50
"And Papa says I've got the brass.

00:35:21.60,00:35:24.30
"Now I wish that you would tell me...

00:35:25.60,00:35:28.60
"...'cause I'm much too young[br]to know..."

00:36:11.60,00:36:14.10
All right, Blanche Hudson!

00:36:14.40,00:36:17.30
Ms. Big, Fat, Movie Star!

00:36:17.70,00:36:20.70
Ms. Rotten, Stinking Actress!

00:36:21.00,00:36:22.60
Press a button, ring a bell...

00:36:22.90,00:36:27.10
...and you think the whole damn world[br]comes running, don't you?!

00:36:29.40,00:36:31.00
Lunch, Ms. Hudson?

00:36:31.40,00:36:34.70
Why, certainly, Ms. Hudson!

00:36:35.00,00:36:39.60
I'm sure we can find something[br]appropriate for you, Ms. Hudson!

00:37:16.20,00:37:19.40
Oh, you brought my lunch.[br]A bit early, isn't it?

00:37:19.60,00:37:21.10
Then what were you ringing for?

00:37:21.50,00:37:24.80
Oh, I wanted to tell you,[br]something's wrong with the telephone.

00:37:25.00,00:37:27.00
Maybe it's been left off[br]the hook downstairs.

00:37:27.00,00:37:28.80
Is that so?

00:37:28.90,00:37:31.10
Who'd you wanna call, Blanche?

00:37:31.40,00:37:35.20
Well, actually I wanted[br]to call Bert Hanley.

00:37:36.50,00:37:38.80
Oh, our business manager?

00:37:40.80,00:37:45.20
There's something I've been[br]meaning to discuss with you.

00:37:52.60,00:37:55.90
Well, I'm afraid I have bad news...[br]about money.

00:37:56.60,00:38:01.10
You see the point is, Bert thinks[br]we'll probably have to sell the house.

00:38:03.00,00:38:05.80
Why should we have to[br]sell the house, Blanche?

00:38:08.60,00:38:11.00
Well, that's what I'm trying[br]to tell you.

00:38:11.50,00:38:14.50
Our financial position[br]is such that we just...

00:38:14.80,00:38:16.00
...we can't afford to...

00:38:16.30,00:38:18.20
We've got plenty of[br]money invested. I know.

00:38:18.50,00:38:21.20
Yes... yes, that's quite true, but...

00:38:21.70,00:38:24.70
...some of those investments[br]aren't paying much.

00:38:27.10,00:38:31.00
When did our business manager[br]tell you all this?

00:38:32.30,00:38:33.80
Early last week, I think.

00:38:35.20,00:38:38.00
He didn't call here last week.[br]I know that, too.

00:38:38.30,00:38:42.50
No, we didn't actually speak[br]on the telephone.

00:38:42.80,00:38:43.80
He wrote me a letter.

00:38:43.90,00:38:45.60
He didn't write you any letter either.

00:38:45.90,00:38:47.20
There hasn't been a letter[br]from his office since...

00:38:47.20,00:38:48.20
Yes, Jane, there has.

00:38:48.30,00:38:51.50
Oh, you're a liar! You're just a liar![br]You always were!

00:38:53.10,00:38:56.00
Bert Hanley never wrote you any letter[br]and never called you on the phone...

00:38:56.20,00:38:57.80
...tellin' you to sell the house.

00:38:58.00,00:39:01.40
You called him four weeks ago[br]and told him to sell it!

00:39:03.70,00:39:05.80
I did nothing of the sort.

00:39:06.60,00:39:10.50
Don't you think I know everything[br]that goes on in this house?

00:39:14.00,00:39:15.80
You've been spying on me!

00:39:17.50,00:39:19.30
What do you think?!

00:39:19.90,00:39:21.40
You are disgusting!

00:39:22.90,00:39:24.40
After all I've done for you!

00:39:24.70,00:39:26.30
When all I'm trying to do is help.

00:39:26.40,00:39:28.60
Who are you tryin' to help, Blanche?

00:39:29.10,00:39:31.80
What were you plannin' to do with me[br]when you sold the house?

00:39:32.10,00:39:33.60
What'd you have in mind...

00:39:33.80,00:39:36.70
...some nice little place[br]where they could look after me?

00:39:48.90,00:39:52.40
Better not tire yourself out[br]using the phone anymore.

00:39:53.10,00:39:56.20
If there are any calls,[br]I'll take them downstairs.

00:39:59.70,00:40:02.30
Eat your lunch, it'll get cold!

00:41:29.10,00:41:31.50
Jane! Please wait.

00:41:36.80,00:41:39.90
Jane, I want to talk to you... please!

00:41:40.50,00:41:42.00
Jane, I want to talk to...

00:43:16.10,00:43:17.50
Telephone, mother.

00:43:18.30,00:43:19.70
All right, dear.

00:44:18.30,00:44:20.30
I called this morning and placed an ad.

00:44:20.60,00:44:22.30
Did we give you a reference number?

00:44:22.30,00:44:23.20
Oh, yeah.

00:44:33.50,00:44:36.50
Here it is.[br]You want to check the copy?

00:44:42.20,00:44:43.40
That's fine.

00:44:43.60,00:44:45.90
Did you want this to go in the[br]"Personal" column or in the want ads?

00:44:46.10,00:44:48.80
Well, I always think the "Personal"[br]column's nicer, don't you.

00:44:52.80,00:44:56.20
That's an eight-line ad.[br]That'll be $6.30.

00:45:04.80,00:45:06.50
Who's placing this ad?

00:45:08.10,00:45:09.10
We have to know.

00:45:09.70,00:45:10.70
Why, I am!

00:45:11.90,00:45:13.80
Yeah, I know, but who for?

00:45:14.10,00:45:16.00
You see, when you're placing[br]an advertisement for someone...

00:45:16.00,00:45:18.50
...to do a job for you, we have to[br]have your name for the record.

00:45:18.70,00:45:21.50
Well, my name is... Jane Hudson.

00:45:26.70,00:45:30.70
Maybe you remember me.[br]I'm Baby Jane Hudson!

00:45:32.70,00:45:33.50
Sure.

00:45:34.60,00:45:37.10
Thank you. This will be[br]in the paper tomorrow.

00:45:41.60,00:45:44.60
Who the hell was Baby Jane Hudson?

00:45:47.00,00:45:50.30
"Please call Dr. Shelby[br]at OL6-1656 and...

00:45:50.50,00:45:53.10
"...ask him to come[br]to the house immediately."

00:46:01.90,00:46:05.40
"Under no circumstances...

00:46:08.50,00:46:11.30
"...let my sister...

00:46:12.60,00:46:17.20
"...see the contents...

00:46:17.40,00:46:21.50
"...of this note.

00:46:22.20,00:46:24.50
"...Blanche Hudson."

00:47:33.90,00:47:35.60
Oh, Ms. Hudson, how nice to see you.

00:47:36.00,00:47:38.20
- I was just going to call on you.[br]- Why?

00:47:38.40,00:47:41.30
I just wanted to ask you about the[br]flowers I brought over for your sister.

00:47:41.50,00:47:43.80
I'm afraid they don't last very long[br]this time of year and...

00:47:44.00,00:47:46.10
...I thought perhaps[br]you'd like some more.

00:47:48.60,00:47:49.80
You could've saved yourself[br]the trouble.

00:47:49.90,00:47:51.30
Oh, but it's no trouble at all.

00:47:51.40,00:47:54.10
I've just been cutting some,[br]that's why I came over.

00:47:54.50,00:47:56.10
I always think it's so nice[br]to have flowers...

00:47:56.20,00:47:57.60
...in the house...[br]- Mrs. Bates!

00:47:58.10,00:48:01.00
I guess if my sister needed flowers,[br]we could afford to buy them!

00:48:45.70,00:48:48.40
What's the matter, Mother? You look[br]as though you've been in a fight.

00:48:48.70,00:48:50.50
I'm not sure that I haven't been.

00:48:50.80,00:48:54.00
Jane Hudson makes me so mad,[br]I could kill her!

00:48:55.30,00:48:56.70
That's a good idea.

00:48:57.00,00:48:58.50
What'll we use?

00:49:55.90,00:49:57.90
Did you have a nice drive?

00:49:58.70,00:50:00.10
What are you talking about?

00:50:00.40,00:50:03.10
Nothing, dear. It's been so long[br]since you were out of the house.

00:50:03.40,00:50:05.90
I though perhaps you'd gone[br]for a drive or something.

00:50:06.20,00:50:07.80
You know, I was thinking...

00:50:09.00,00:50:12.10
...it's been so long since[br]we had a talk...

00:50:12.90,00:50:15.70
...you know, a real talk[br]about the future and everything.

00:50:20.20,00:50:22.60
I didn't want you to be worried[br]about the house.

00:50:22.90,00:50:25.80
Even if I do have to sell it,[br]we'll still be together.

00:50:26.10,00:50:28.50
Blanche, you're not going[br]to sell this house.

00:50:29.90,00:50:31.80
Daddy bought this house.

00:50:32.10,00:50:33.70
And he bought it for me.

00:50:36.00,00:50:38.30
You don't think I remember that,[br]do you?

00:50:39.30,00:50:41.20
You're wrong, Jane.

00:50:41.30,00:50:42.80
You've just forgotten.

00:50:43.70,00:50:45.70
I bought this house for the two of us...

00:50:45.90,00:50:47.40
...when I signed my first contract.

00:50:47.50,00:50:50.20
You don't think I remember anything,[br]do you?

00:50:51.20,00:50:53.00
There're a whole lot of things[br]I remember.

00:50:53.30,00:50:55.40
And you never paid for this house.

00:50:56.30,00:51:00.60
Baby Jane paid for this house,[br]that's who!

00:51:01.00,00:51:03.00
You don't know what you're saying.

00:51:07.10,00:51:10.00
You aren't ever gonna[br]sell this house.

00:51:10.40,00:51:12.90
And you aren't ever[br]gonna leave it...

00:51:14.30,00:51:15.70
...either.

00:51:29.00,00:51:32.40
Do you remember when[br]I first came back after the accident?

00:51:37.70,00:51:41.00
You promised you wouldn't ever[br]talk about that again.

00:51:41.20,00:51:42.50
I know I did...

00:51:43.30,00:51:45.30
...but I'm still in this chair.

00:51:45.50,00:51:48.60
After all those years[br]I'm still in this chair.

00:51:48.90,00:51:52.00
Doesn't that give you[br]some kind of responsibility?

00:51:52.50,00:51:55.60
Jane, I'm just trying to explain[br]to you how things really are.

00:51:56.20,00:51:58.30
You wouldn't be able to do[br]these awful things to me...

00:51:58.40,00:52:00.50
...if I weren't still in this chair!

00:52:05.60,00:52:09.20
But you are, Blanche![br]You are in that chair!

00:52:10.20,00:52:15.00
And tell me what are these awful things[br]I'm supposed to be doing to you?

00:52:17.90,00:52:19.20
Well I meant...

00:52:20.20,00:52:22.70
...you wouldn't have to work so hard.

00:52:23.30,00:52:25.60
And I was thinking maybe...

00:52:25.70,00:52:28.40
...maybe Elvira could come in[br]more often.

00:52:29.00,00:52:31.20
Maybe she could even live with us.

00:52:32.10,00:52:34.40
We don't need Elvira!

00:52:36.00,00:52:38.00
But you get so tired, you...

00:52:39.00,00:52:41.50
There's so much to do,[br]and you're not well.

00:52:42.50,00:52:44.00
Maybe you're right.

00:52:45.30,00:52:48.10
Maybe I should get[br]a check-up or something.

00:52:49.50,00:52:51.60
That would be wonderful!

00:52:52.80,00:52:56.80
Perhaps we can, we can find[br]a really good doctor.

00:52:57.60,00:53:01.60
We could get hold of that[br]nice Dr. Shelby, couldn't we?

00:53:03.20,00:53:04.80
Let's see...

00:53:05.70,00:53:07.70
...what's his number again?

00:53:17.20,00:53:20.10
"...Under no circumstances...

00:53:20.60,00:53:24.70
"...tell my sister the contents[br]of this note."

00:53:26.20,00:53:29.00
It's not me that needs[br]a doctor, Blanche!

00:55:30.90,00:55:32.80
Hello, lovey.

00:55:33.70,00:55:35.90
Now, don't stop for me.

00:55:36.20,00:55:37.80
What did the doctor say?

00:55:39.00,00:55:43.70
He says it's no use my trying[br]to go back to work for six months.

00:55:44.00,00:55:45.90
Didn't he even give you[br]anything new to take?

00:55:46.10,00:55:48.40
Oh, he says it's arthritis.

00:55:48.70,00:55:53.00
An' the only thing for me to do is[br]not to try an' work until it clears up.

00:55:53.30,00:55:56.90
Did he suggest what we're going[br]to use for money in the meantime?

00:55:57.80,00:56:01.20
No, dear.[br]But he's ever such a nice man.

00:56:03.70,00:56:06.10
Now, lovey, never you mind, anyway.

00:56:06.60,00:56:09.80
You know, we've still got[br]a bit of savings.

00:56:10.20,00:56:12.60
You're my little worrier.

00:56:13.80,00:56:16.70
That's nice.[br]You've found something, have you?

00:56:17.00,00:56:20.60
You don't have to get so excited.[br]You haven't even seen what it is yet.

00:56:21.50,00:56:23.80
No, dear but it's a possibility,[br]isn't it?

00:56:24.00,00:56:26.90
I mean, there aren't that many jobs[br]that'd be suitable...

00:56:27.20,00:56:30.00
...I mean for someone[br]with your qualifications.

00:56:30.30,00:56:33.40
What qualifications?

00:56:34.50,00:56:37.40
Well, you know... serious music[br]and that...

00:56:37.60,00:56:41.50
Oh, this sounds like[br]just the ticket, doesn't it?

00:56:45.30,00:56:47.70
- You're gonna call?[br]- Call who?

00:56:48.40,00:56:50.00
These people.

00:56:51.00,00:56:51.80
Might as well.

00:56:51.90,00:56:52.90
Now?

00:56:53.20,00:56:57.70
Well, it wouldn't be a lot of bloody use[br]calling next week, would it?

00:57:03.00,00:57:06.70
Mom, tell you what.[br]Why don't you call for me?

00:57:07.50,00:57:09.40
Tell them you're my secretary[br]or something.

00:57:09.50,00:57:11.90
All right, dear, I'll do that.

00:57:13.10,00:57:15.30
And listen, I won't let on who I am.

00:57:15.60,00:57:19.60
You see, I'll just tell 'em[br]I'm Mr. Flagg's "secketary."

00:57:19.90,00:57:23.50
- Secretary.[br]- Sec-re-tary.

00:57:26.10,00:57:27.30
Well, do you know...

00:57:27.50,00:57:29.50
...I do believe yer old mum'd...

00:57:29.70,00:57:32.90
...be a jolly good "secketary" at that.

00:57:33.90,00:57:36.20
Don't you think?

00:57:52.50,00:57:54.30
This is Jane Hudson.

00:57:56.30,00:57:58.40
Oh, about the ad!

00:58:00.20,00:58:01.30
Who is this?

00:58:01.60,00:58:04.50
This is Mr. Flagg's "secketary."

00:58:05.30,00:58:07.30
Oh, his secretary.

00:58:09.00,00:58:11.00
Mr. Flagg is very interested.

00:58:11.30,00:58:13.60
And he'd like to know if[br]he can have an appointment.

00:58:13.90,00:58:17.90
I think you'll find[br]he's very well qualified.

00:58:18.80,00:58:21.80
Well, sure, I'd be glad to give[br]Mr. Flagg an appointment.

00:58:22.80,00:58:24.70
Well, now, let me see...

00:58:25.30,00:58:27.00
...how 'bout 4:00 this afternoon?

00:58:30.00,00:58:32.50
I think that would be fine.

00:58:34.00,00:58:36.00
Well, I'll be expecting him then.

00:58:44.60,00:58:46.80
It's all fixed, lovey.

00:58:47.10,00:58:51.20
Ah, yer old mum's managed everything...

00:58:51.80,00:58:53.30
...hasn't she?

00:59:00.60,00:59:01.80
Oh, shut up!

00:59:13.60,00:59:14.90
What do you want this time?

00:59:15.20,00:59:16.50
Who was on the telephone?

00:59:16.70,00:59:18.90
None of your business![br]What were you ringing for?

00:59:19.20,00:59:20.20
I'm hungry, Jane.

00:59:20.50,00:59:22.30
Well, of course you're hungry.[br]You didn't eat your dinner.

00:59:22.40,00:59:23.70
That's why you're hungry.

00:59:24.90,00:59:26.40
But you forgot my breakfast.

00:59:26.90,00:59:29.20
I didn't forget your breakfast.

00:59:30.00,00:59:31.80
I didn't bring your breakfast...

00:59:32.10,00:59:34.60
...because you didn't eat your din-din.

00:59:38.30,00:59:40.00
We're right back where we started.

00:59:40.30,00:59:43.20
When I was on the stage, you had[br]to depend on me for everything...

00:59:43.50,00:59:46.00
...even the food you ate[br]came from me.

00:59:46.30,00:59:48.70
Now you have to depend on me[br]for your food again.

00:59:49.00,00:59:50.90
So you see, we're right back[br]where we started.

00:59:51.50,00:59:53.40
Why are you doing this to me?

00:59:53.40,00:59:54.30
Why?

00:59:55.40,00:59:56.40
Doing what?

00:59:56.80,00:59:59.90
Making me afraid to eat,[br]trying to make me starve myself.

01:00:01.10,01:00:02.50
Don't be silly.

01:00:03.10,01:00:05.20
If you starve, you die.

01:00:05.40,01:00:07.90
I don't know what you're talking about.[br]You really must be sick!

01:00:11.40,01:00:13.30
Did you ever stop to think that...

01:00:13.90,01:00:17.10
...if anything happened to me,[br]I mean anything bad...

01:00:18.20,01:00:20.10
...there wouldn't be any money for you?

01:00:20.30,01:00:22.20
I wouldn't be here to sign the checks.

01:00:22.50,01:00:24.40
You wouldn't even have pocket money.

01:00:25.50,01:00:27.50
Did you ever think of that?

01:00:28.40,01:00:30.20
I've thought about that.

01:00:35.10,01:00:37.20
Why didn't you eat your dinner?

01:00:38.50,01:00:40.10
Because I'm afraid.

01:00:40.30,01:00:42.00
You made me afraid.

01:00:42.80,01:00:46.40
I thought you were supposed to be[br]the big girl in this family.

01:00:49.40,01:00:51.30
Nothing wrong with it.

01:00:52.10,01:00:54.20
You're just a neurotic, Blanche!

01:00:56.60,01:00:57.50
D'you know that...

01:00:57.60,01:00:59.40
...you're just a neurotic?

01:01:06.20,01:01:08.40
- Good morning, Elvira.[br]- Good morning.

01:01:16.60,01:01:19.30
- Please, Jane, I'm so hungry.[br]- I have to go now.

01:01:19.50,01:01:21.40
But just a little, please!

01:01:21.80,01:01:26.00
No. You didn't eat your din-din,[br]so you'll have to wait till lunchtime.

01:01:26.20,01:01:30.10
Jane, please... don't do this to me.[br]Jane! Please!

01:01:54.40,01:01:57.30
- Good morning, Elvira.[br]- Good morning, Ms. Jane.

01:01:59.10,01:02:01.00
I wanna talk to you.

01:02:01.20,01:02:03.20
- I want to apologize.[br]- Apologize?

01:02:03.90,01:02:07.60
I wasn't feeling so well yesterday,[br]so I was unkind to you.

01:02:08.60,01:02:10.40
I want to make it up.

01:02:10.50,01:02:13.00
I got up this morning[br]and fixed the house.

01:02:14.30,01:02:16.20
So you can have the whole day off.

01:02:17.10,01:02:18.90
Here's your $15.

01:02:19.50,01:02:22.30
Well, thanks, but does Miss...[br]What I mean, is...

01:02:22.60,01:02:24.40
...does Ms. Blanche know[br]about my taking the day off?

01:02:24.50,01:02:26.00
Oh, sure, she knows.

01:02:26.90,01:02:29.00
All right... if you say so.

01:02:29.30,01:02:31.40
See you next Tuesday then.

01:02:32.50,01:02:33.80
Have a good time.

01:02:35.00,01:02:36.10
Goodbye.

01:02:47.00,01:02:47.90
Bye!

01:04:12.60,01:04:14.50
Who was that at the door earlier?

01:04:14.60,01:04:15.60
Elvira.

01:04:16.40,01:04:18.50
Where is she now? In the kitchen?

01:04:19.50,01:04:22.10
No. I gave her the day off.

01:04:22.40,01:04:24.80
She has a pretty hard time, considering.

01:04:25.00,01:04:26.90
I told her to come back next week.

01:04:34.80,01:04:36.40
You know we got rats in the cellar?

01:07:11.60,01:07:12.80
Good afternoon.

01:07:17.30,01:07:18.50
Mr. Flagg?

01:07:18.80,01:07:21.10
Yes, I'm Edwin Flagg.

01:07:22.80,01:07:26.80
I have an appointment with[br]Ms. Hudson for 4:00 o'clock.

01:07:27.40,01:07:29.50
I'm Jane Hudson.

01:07:30.50,01:07:33.60
My, you're... you're right on time,[br]aren't you?

01:07:33.90,01:07:35.70
Yes, I believe I am.

01:07:36.80,01:07:37.80
Come in.

01:07:58.40,01:08:00.40
We can talk here in the living room.

01:08:05.60,01:08:09.70
Oh, I say... what a perfectly[br]charming room.

01:08:12.90,01:08:15.80
- So, you're Edwin Flagg?[br]- Yes, that's right.

01:08:17.30,01:08:19.20
I'll bring you some tea. You like tea?

01:08:19.70,01:08:22.10
Oh, yes. I'm quite fond of tea.

01:08:22.30,01:08:24.40
You must've guessed that I'm English.

01:08:25.20,01:08:27.30
Oh, really? How nice for you.

01:09:41.50,01:09:44.20
Oh, here, let me help you.

01:09:39.00,01:09:40.10
That's a terribly big...

01:09:40.20,01:09:42.40
...burden for such a little girl.

01:09:42.80,01:09:45.10
Thank you. You're very kind.

01:09:47.00,01:09:49.70
It's so hot today.[br]Did you drive here in your car?

01:09:49.90,01:09:51.80
Well, actually I took a cab.

01:09:51.90,01:09:55.70
It's a bit of a nuisance, but I had[br]to put my car in for servicing.

01:09:56.70,01:09:58.20
- Oh. Cream or lemon?[br]- Cream.

01:10:00.50,01:10:01.70
Sugar?

01:10:07.50,01:10:09.70
My, it looks good.

01:10:10.90,01:10:14.90
I always think it's nice[br]to break bread...

01:10:15.10,01:10:17.60
...with strangers, don't you?[br]- Oh, yes, indeed.

01:10:19.80,01:10:22.80
I don't think you actually mentioned[br]the exact nature of...

01:10:23.70,01:10:25.40
Well, I've been retired[br]for some time now.

01:10:25.70,01:10:28.60
I've been taking care of someone[br]in my family who's sick.

01:10:28.70,01:10:30.90
And now you're free to return[br]to your profession?

01:10:30.90,01:10:31.80
Yes.

01:10:32.80,01:10:34.30
And what exactly...

01:10:34.90,01:10:37.80
I mean, I take it you are a soloist.[br]Some instrument?

01:10:40.70,01:10:42.80
I wonder if you can guess who I am.

01:10:46.90,01:10:48.30
Can you give me a hint?

01:10:48.70,01:10:51.70
Well, it's not fair to make you guess.

01:10:53.00,01:10:55.20
I'm Baby Jane Hudson!

01:11:04.30,01:11:07.90
Oh! Do you mean you're really[br]the Baby Jane Hudson?

01:11:08.40,01:11:09.50
Yes, I am!

01:11:09.80,01:11:13.00
And I'm going to revive my act[br]exactly as I used to do it.

01:11:13.30,01:11:15.90
Of course, some of the arrangements[br]will have to be brought up to date.

01:11:16.00,01:11:18.70
Music changes so much, doesn't it?

01:11:19.00,01:11:20.80
And you know, they're desperate[br]for new acts. Television...

01:11:20.90,01:11:23.30
...Las Vegas and all the clubs and...

01:11:23.50,01:11:26.50
...there are a lot of people[br]who remember me, lots of them.

01:11:28.00,01:11:30.00
I don't see how you could fail.

01:11:37.20,01:11:39.20
You know, I had a kind of a feeling...

01:11:39.30,01:11:41.50
...the minute I opened that door[br]and saw you standing there.

01:11:41.90,01:11:44.70
I just knew we were going to be friends.

01:11:45.00,01:11:46.90
I've been thinking about costumes.

01:11:47.50,01:11:48.30
Costumes...

01:11:48.40,01:11:49.50
Yes. I took some of my old ones...

01:11:49.60,01:11:52.10
...down to be copied.[br]You think that's a good idea?

01:11:52.30,01:11:53.70
Of course.

01:11:54.10,01:11:56.50
But I don't quite remember...

01:11:56.70,01:11:58.50
How silly of me, Edwin.[br]How could you?

01:11:58.70,01:12:01.30
But I do want your opinion.[br]I really do.

01:12:01.40,01:12:03.50
All my scrap books and stuff[br]are in the rehearsal room and...

01:12:03.60,01:12:05.80
...you can look at them[br]and tell me what you think.

01:12:07.90,01:12:09.90
- You'd like to see them, wouldn't you?[br]- Well, of course.

01:12:12.40,01:12:15.60
Oh, I wish Daddy could be here[br]right now!

01:12:16.30,01:12:19.10
"You can never lose your talent,"[br]he used to tell me.

01:12:19.40,01:12:22.70
"You can lose everything[br]but you can't lose your talent!"

01:12:30.40,01:12:31.70
I think you'll find these clippings...

01:12:31.80,01:12:33.40
...very interesting.

01:12:33.60,01:12:35.70
Daddy saved them for me[br]from the very first.

01:12:36.00,01:12:38.40
He used to put them in special books.

01:12:41.10,01:12:43.30
I always liked that picture.

01:12:44.50,01:12:45.20
It's so sad.

01:12:54.30,01:12:56.20
- Will you excuse me?[br]- Yes, certainly.

01:13:09.20,01:13:12.30
You always spoil everything![br]Don't you?!

01:13:12.80,01:13:15.60
- No, Jane. I just wanted to know...[br]- Who is down there? I'll tell ya!

01:13:16.30,01:13:19.20
I got a friend down there.[br]Someone who's come to see me!

01:13:19.50,01:13:22.50
He doesn't even know you exist![br]And you don't like that, do you?

01:13:22.60,01:13:24.90
But you're wrong, Jane.[br]I've always wanted you to have friends.

01:13:25.00,01:13:26.40
That's what I've always wanted, really.

01:13:26.50,01:13:27.90
Then how come I never had any?

01:13:28.10,01:13:29.60
Well, maybe you weren't...

01:13:30.10,01:13:32.30
...I've, I mean, you were[br]just too independent...

01:13:32.60,01:13:33.60
No, that's not why!

01:13:33.70,01:13:35.90
You always stopped me[br]from having friends, that's why!

01:13:36.50,01:13:38.40
Not anymore, Jane, not anymore.

01:13:38.70,01:13:42.30
I'm pleased that you have a friend.[br]That's what you need.

01:13:42.40,01:13:44.80
- Oh, sure![br]- I was just hoping maybe...

01:13:45.00,01:13:48.40
...I could meet him and we could have[br]a nice talk just the three of us.

01:13:48.70,01:13:50.10
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:13:50.30,01:13:52.50
Then you could tell him[br]a whole lot of lies about me.

01:13:52.80,01:13:54.10
Scare him off...

01:13:54.30,01:13:55.40
...or maybe have him...

01:13:55.50,01:13:57.20
...for yourself!

01:14:37.20,01:14:41.70
"I've written a letter to Daddy.

01:14:42.30,01:14:46.40
"His address is heaven above."

01:14:48.20,01:14:49.80
That's wonderful!

01:15:01.70,01:15:05.80
"I've written a letter to Daddy.

01:15:06.70,01:15:10.90
"His address is heaven above.

01:15:12.70,01:15:16.90
"I've written, Dear Daddy,[br]we miss you...

01:15:18.00,01:15:22.00
"...and wish you were with us to love.

01:15:24.90,01:15:28.90
"Instead of a stamp I put kisses.

01:15:29.90,01:15:34.00
"The postman says that's best to do.

01:15:36.50,01:15:40.60
"I've written a letter to Daddy...

01:15:40.70,01:15:45.60
"...saying, I love you.

01:16:39.00,01:16:43.20
"I've written a letter to Daddy...

01:16:43.30,01:16:47.60
"...saying, I love you!"

01:17:09.00,01:17:10.90
Oh, Edwin, you certainly[br]can play, can't you?

01:17:11.20,01:17:14.10
- And you certainly can sing.[br]- Oh, thank you.

01:17:14.70,01:17:17.10
I can see you've done[br]this kind of work before.

01:17:17.40,01:17:18.60
No. Not really.

01:17:18.90,01:17:21.60
Actually, I've spent most of my time[br]on serious music.

01:17:21.70,01:17:23.30
Composing, and that sort of thing.

01:17:23.40,01:17:25.60
You mean, this will be your[br]first contact with show business?

01:17:25.90,01:17:27.00
Not exactly.

01:17:27.30,01:17:30.20
You see, my father was[br]quite well known as an actor.

01:17:30.50,01:17:32.70
In the movies?[br]Maybe I worked with him.

01:17:33.00,01:17:35.40
I shouldn't think so.

01:17:35.70,01:17:38.20
He's been dead quite a long time now.

01:17:38.40,01:17:41.10
I lost my daddy when[br]I was quite young, too.

01:17:41.30,01:17:44.30
Of course, he was more in the[br]classical tradition, I mean as an actor.

01:17:44.50,01:17:46.20
Shakespeare and that sort of thing.

01:17:46.40,01:17:49.30
People used to say Daddy could've been[br]a star in his own right.

01:17:49.60,01:17:51.30
He was a musician, too.

01:17:51.50,01:17:52.50
Oh? What instrument?

01:17:52.60,01:17:53.90
Piano and banjo.

01:17:56.80,01:17:59.10
Oh, that's very interesting.

01:17:59.40,01:18:02.30
You know, the banjo's a very[br]native American instrument.

01:18:02.70,01:18:04.50
Of course, my father was British...

01:18:05.00,01:18:06.00
...but he never...

01:18:06.10,01:18:08.80
...really got a chance[br]out here in Hollywood.

01:18:09.10,01:18:10.80
Oh, that's too bad.

01:18:22.30,01:18:23.40
It's funny, really.

01:18:23.70,01:18:26.80
Because actually he came from a[br]rather distinguished family, socially...

01:18:27.10,01:18:30.40
...and yet nearly all the parts he had[br]were playing menials, butlers and such.

01:18:31.20,01:18:32.20
- Oh, really?[br]- Yes.

01:18:33.50,01:18:34.70
I don't think my mother...

01:18:34.90,01:18:37.80
...ever really appreciated[br]what he was trying to do.

01:18:38.30,01:18:39.90
Oh, I know what you mean.

01:18:40.10,01:18:43.70
It's very hard for an artist[br]when people don't understand.

01:18:44.00,01:18:44.90
I remember when...

01:18:45.00,01:18:47.40
I sometimes try to explain to her...

01:18:47.50,01:18:49.70
...that if you're going to produce[br]anything decent in the way...

01:18:49.80,01:18:51.50
...of serious music...

01:18:52.30,01:18:55.40
...you must have the right atmosphere.

01:18:55.80,01:18:57.90
But of course.[br]Delia can't understand that.

01:18:59.30,01:19:01.60
Delia? Who's Delia?

01:19:02.70,01:19:05.70
You might not think it to look at her,[br]but she is my mother.

01:19:08.60,01:19:10.60
For a minute I thought you had...

01:19:10.80,01:19:12.70
...a wife or a lady friend...

01:19:12.90,01:19:14.50
...tucked away somewhere.

01:19:16.70,01:19:21.50
Oh, no. Nothing like that. How much[br]were you actually thinking of paying?

01:19:22.00,01:19:23.00
Paying?

01:19:28.00,01:19:29.20
Well, what do you think?

01:19:33.80,01:19:35.20
How about a $100?

01:19:36.10,01:19:38.10
A week, of course.

01:19:40.80,01:19:42.30
Oh. I think that would be fair.

01:19:42.50,01:19:44.30
Then that's settled.

01:19:44.50,01:19:46.20
I don't like talking about money,[br]do you?

01:19:46.50,01:19:50.00
No. It's not that important, is it?[br]Not like relationships between people...

01:19:50.30,01:19:53.00
...but the thing is, if I'm going to[br]move out and give up my pupils...

01:19:53.30,01:19:55.20
...I'll have to know for sure.

01:19:55.60,01:19:57.70
When were you thinking of starting?

01:19:58.50,01:20:01.10
Just when could you let me[br]have some money?

01:20:02.30,01:20:06.80
Well, I've some family matters[br]to take care of...

01:20:07.90,01:20:10.80
...that should take about a week or so.

01:20:11.10,01:20:14.50
Well, then I don't see why[br]we couldn't start rehearsing right away.

01:20:17.70,01:20:19.00
Tell you what, Edwin...

01:20:19.30,01:20:23.60
...I'll pay you first thing Wednesday,[br]a month in advance.

01:20:25.20,01:20:26.40
It's done.

01:20:26.70,01:20:29.10
How about going to dinner[br]somewhere nice?

01:20:29.40,01:20:31.10
Oh, it sounds fine.

01:20:31.70,01:20:33.10
Why don't you come with me now?

01:20:33.20,01:20:35.10
I've got to go down and pick up[br]my costumes and then...

01:20:35.10,01:20:37.10
...we could go on to dinner from there.

01:20:37.90,01:20:42.40
Oh, I promised my mo...[br]...Delia I'd be home for supper.

01:20:43.60,01:20:45.80
Oh. Well, I'll drive you home then.

01:20:47.10,01:20:48.90
Oh, I'm so excited.

01:20:49.20,01:20:52.80
You know, I know everything[br]is going to go just marvelously.

01:20:53.40,01:20:56.50
I have to go up and change.[br]I won't be a minute.

01:21:17.50,01:21:18.40
This is really...

01:21:18.70,01:21:20.90
...a rather charming neighborhood.

01:21:23.90,01:21:26.70
Yes, I've always found it very nice.

01:23:34.00,01:23:35.90
I just can't wait to get started now,[br]rehearsing.

01:23:36.20,01:23:38.00
We're going to be a great team,[br]the two of us.

01:23:38.30,01:23:40.50
Oh, I'm sure we are.

01:23:42.50,01:23:44.30
I'll see you Wednesday. Bye.

01:26:39.70,01:26:41.70
This is Blanche, Blanche Hudson.

01:26:42.90,01:26:46.10
I need your help. Is the doctor there?[br]I must talk to him.

01:26:46.50,01:26:48.20
Well, he's with a patient right now.

01:26:48.80,01:26:51.40
But I have to talk to him.[br]I've got to.

01:26:52.00,01:26:54.70
Hold on, please.[br]I'll see if I can interrupt him.

01:26:58.80,01:27:02.20
Ms. Hill tells me you're a little upset.[br]What seems to be the trouble?

01:27:03.60,01:27:05.90
You must come. I need you here.

01:27:12.70,01:27:14.70
No. It's about my sister.

01:27:15.50,01:27:18.00
I need your help. I need you here.

01:27:18.50,01:27:19.90
Here at the house.

01:27:20.60,01:27:22.70
No. It's nothing like that.

01:27:24.10,01:27:26.30
It's the way she's behaving.

01:27:27.30,01:27:31.00
You've got to come over right away.[br]Please, before she comes back.

01:27:31.20,01:27:32.60
I don't quite understand.

01:27:32.80,01:27:35.30
Is this some kind of emotional[br]disturbance you're talking about?

01:27:35.60,01:27:39.00
Yes, she's emotionally disturbed.

01:27:39.50,01:27:41.30
She's unbalanced.

01:27:43.00,01:27:45.10
I don't know, doctor.

01:27:45.80,01:27:47.70
Are you trying to tell me[br]that she's violent?

01:27:48.50,01:27:49.40
Yes!

01:27:50.00,01:27:51.20
Yes, she is!

01:28:08.70,01:28:10.90
I'm... not sure.

01:28:24.20,01:28:26.90
We aren't getting anywhere like this.[br]I'll come over right away.

01:28:32.80,01:28:34.70
I know who it was.

01:28:35.00,01:28:36.40
No, Jane, that really was...

01:28:36.70,01:28:39.00
And I know what you're trying to do.

01:28:39.20,01:28:41.70
I'm not trying to do anything.[br]Honestly, Jane.

01:29:44.80,01:29:47.00
This is Blanche Hudson again.

01:29:47.40,01:29:48.80
Could I speak to the doctor?

01:29:49.10,01:29:52.50
Oh, yes, certainly. Hold on, please.[br]I'll try and catch him.

01:30:01.80,01:30:03.60
Hello, Blanche. I'm on my way now.

01:30:04.50,01:30:07.20
Oh, I'm so glad I caught you in time.

01:30:07.50,01:30:10.50
Dr. Shelby, we're not going[br]to need you after all.

01:30:12.10,01:30:15.70
I know, but Jane has gone[br]to another doctor.

01:30:16.60,01:30:19.70
- Another doctor?[br]- Yes. Another doctor.

01:30:20.60,01:30:22.80
Well, of course, if she's chosen[br]to go to someone else...

01:30:25.50,01:30:28.70
Well, after all,[br]we really can't interfere, can we?

01:30:28.90,01:30:31.50
If Jane's chosen to go[br]to another doctor...

01:30:32.30,01:30:34.10
I'm very sorry.

01:30:40.80,01:30:42.90
Goodbye, doctor.

01:31:22.50,01:31:24.90
I thought I told you not to come back[br]until next week.

01:31:25.00,01:31:28.10
Yes, but I had a free day today[br]so I thought I'd come by and see...

01:31:28.20,01:31:30.60
...if there was anything needed doin'.[br]- Well, there isn't anything.

01:31:30.60,01:31:32.70
So you could've saved yourself[br]the trouble.

01:31:33.30,01:31:36.00
I was gonna write you a note, but now[br]you're here I may as well tell you.

01:31:36.20,01:31:38.00
We're not gonna be[br]needing you anymore.

01:31:38.70,01:31:40.40
But I don't understand.

01:31:40.60,01:31:41.90
We're closing up the house.

01:31:42.20,01:31:44.20
Blanche wants to take[br]a smaller place at the beach.

01:31:44.30,01:31:47.10
The doctor thinks that's best for her[br]so that's what we're going to do.

01:31:47.60,01:31:50.70
Oh, don't worry, you'll be paid[br]for today. I'll send you a check.

01:31:51.00,01:31:52.50
I'm not worried about any pay.

01:31:52.60,01:31:54.60
I'd just like to see[br]Ms. Blanche before I go.

01:31:55.80,01:31:58.20
Well, you can't. She's asleep.

01:32:00.40,01:32:02.40
That's all right. I don't mind waiting.

01:32:02.80,01:32:05.30
Well, I do, I gotta leave,[br]so just gimme the keys to the house.

01:32:08.10,01:32:11.00
I'm sorry, I don't have the keys.[br]I must've left 'em at home.

01:32:11.30,01:32:12.90
Anyway, go. You're fired.

01:34:03.10,01:34:06.40
Ms. Blanche, are you awake?

01:34:28.20,01:34:30.30
Are you all right in there?

01:34:33.80,01:34:36.50
Wait now, and I'll go find the key.

01:34:41.10,01:34:42.00
Thank you.

01:34:45.70,01:34:47.80
Good morning, Ms. Hudson.

01:34:48.70,01:34:50.30
How's Ms. Blanche these days?

01:34:51.50,01:34:53.50
She's just fine.

01:34:54.00,01:34:55.80
Your deposit slip?

01:34:56.50,01:34:59.40
Well, Blanche wanted me[br]to get it all in cash this time.

01:34:59.60,01:35:03.30
- I guess she has some special reason.[br]- Yes, but doesn't she normally...?

01:35:03.60,01:35:06.90
I mean if she isn't going to deposit[br]her monthly check, she usually...

01:35:07.00,01:35:09.80
...gives us a call and tells us what[br]she wants us to do, doesn't she?

01:35:10.20,01:35:11.80
- Didn't she call?[br]- I don't think so.

01:35:12.80,01:35:16.50
Oh, I guess she must still be asleep.[br]She gave me that check last night.

01:35:16.80,01:35:19.40
I see. Just a moment, please.

01:35:34.20,01:35:36.70
I guess that'll be all right,[br]Ms. Hudson.

01:35:37.60,01:35:40.00
- Fifty and twenties, all right?[br]- Yes, please.

01:35:47.30,01:35:50.40
- There you are.[br]- Thank you.

01:35:58.40,01:36:01.40
Ms. Blanche, I'll tell you right now,[br]if that sister of yours...

01:36:01.50,01:36:04.50
...has gone and given you[br]sleeping pills to keep you quiet...

01:36:04.50,01:36:06.50
...while she's out doin'[br]I don't know what...

01:36:06.70,01:36:10.00
...I'm sure as hell[br]gonna call the police on her.

01:36:10.70,01:36:12.40
It's all right, Ms. Blanche.

01:36:26.20,01:36:27.30
I'm glad I caught you.

01:36:27.40,01:36:30.70
I hope you don't mind, but there's[br]something I've been meaning to ask you.

01:36:30.80,01:36:33.50
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm kind of[br]short of help around the house and...

01:36:33.50,01:36:35.60
...I was wondering if you'd mind me[br]asking your cleaning lady...

01:36:35.70,01:36:37.60
...if she could give me[br]a couple of days a week.

01:36:37.90,01:36:40.50
As far as I'm concerned,[br]you can have her as often as you want.

01:36:40.80,01:36:42.00
My sister and I are moving.

01:36:42.10,01:36:43.40
So we won't want her anymore.

01:36:43.50,01:36:45.70
But you'll have to call her[br]because she isn't here.

01:36:45.80,01:36:47.30
I've already sent her home.

01:36:48.00,01:36:49.70
But I just saw her.

01:36:50.00,01:36:52.10
Yes, but I sent her home.

01:36:52.20,01:36:54.10
Oh, no, but that's impossible.

01:36:54.30,01:36:57.20
I saw her go into the house[br]a few minutes ago.

01:37:02.10,01:37:03.80
- In the house?[br]- Yes.

01:37:28.10,01:37:29.80
So, you finally decided to come back.

01:37:31.40,01:37:32.80
What're you doing here?

01:37:34.40,01:37:36.60
- I told you, you were fired.[br]- Never mind all that.

01:37:36.70,01:37:38.60
I want to know what's goin' on[br]around here.

01:37:38.90,01:37:41.70
But you said you didn't have your key.

01:37:42.20,01:37:43.80
It just so happened that I did.

01:37:43.90,01:37:47.10
So now you can tell me what you mean[br]by lockin' Ms. Blanche in her room.

01:37:50.30,01:37:52.70
This isn't Blanche's house, this is[br]my house. And I can do what I like.

01:37:52.80,01:37:54.80
It doesn't make a bit of difference[br]whose house it is.

01:37:54.90,01:37:57.30
You've got to act like a grown woman,[br]the same as everybody else.

01:37:57.40,01:37:58.90
Suppose there'd been a fire[br]or somethin'...

01:37:58.90,01:38:00.50
...and Ms. Blanche locked up[br]in her room like that?

01:38:00.60,01:38:01.80
Well, there wasn't.

01:38:02.00,01:38:05.10
You open that door and[br]stop all this nonsense.

01:38:05.50,01:38:07.00
Then give me the key!

01:38:07.50,01:38:10.10
She's asleep. I gave her a pill.

01:38:10.70,01:38:12.00
You did, huh?

01:38:12.20,01:38:14.70
Then you better give me that key[br]and be quick about it.

01:38:15.40,01:38:18.10
I won't, and you can't make me.

01:38:18.40,01:38:19.50
I'm not afraid of you.

01:38:20.10,01:38:23.50
All right, Ms. Hudson.[br]I'm not going to fool with you.

01:38:23.60,01:38:25.10
If you won't give me that key...

01:38:25.10,01:38:27.60
...I'll go right and call the police.

01:38:29.60,01:38:31.00
You'll be sorry.

01:38:31.60,01:38:33.10
Give me that key.

01:38:45.90,01:38:47.40
I didn't mean her any harm.

01:38:47.70,01:38:49.60
You better not have done her any harm.

01:38:58.90,01:39:00.80
What has she done to you?

01:39:09.10,01:39:10.60
Get it off in a minute.

01:39:11.20,01:39:13.80
Don't worry, Ms. Blanche.[br]I'll get you down from there.

01:39:17.50,01:39:19.00
You just rest easy.

01:39:35.60,01:39:37.50
Going out are you, dear?

01:39:40.00,01:39:41.10
You know I am.

01:39:41.20,01:39:43.10
Having dinner with her?

01:39:45.10,01:39:47.20
I'm forgotten.

01:39:47.50,01:39:51.00
Now you won't be back too late,[br]will you, lovey? Huh?

01:39:57.80,01:39:59.60
Who knows?

01:40:17.20,01:40:20.40
You could've been[br]better than all of 'em.

01:40:21.30,01:40:24.00
But they didn't want that.

01:40:32.60,01:40:35.00
They just didn't love you enough.

01:40:36.70,01:40:40.10
Do you know that?[br]They just didn't love you enough.

01:41:39.70,01:41:41.80
I'm sorry, Edwin.

01:41:42.50,01:41:44.90
I can't let you in.

01:41:45.60,01:41:47.00
Not now.

01:42:02.70,01:42:04.40
Go to hell!

01:42:15.30,01:42:17.50
I can't let you in.

01:42:23.90,01:42:25.50
Not now.

01:42:52.90,01:42:56.40
What am I going to do?

01:45:12.30,01:45:15.00
I thought... I didn't know[br]there was anyone in here.

01:45:16.00,01:45:17.70
I just came home and saw a light...

01:45:18.00,01:45:20.70
...and I thought perhaps you'd left[br]the lights of your car on.

01:45:21.00,01:45:22.60
You know, I've had that happen to me.

01:45:22.70,01:45:24.10
That's all right, Mrs. Bates.

01:45:24.80,01:45:27.70
I had that happen to me once,[br]it's no joke.

01:45:28.00,01:45:30.80
Wake up in the morning and find[br]you've got a dead battery.

01:45:31.70,01:45:32.80
No joke.

01:45:35.00,01:45:37.70
Well, as long as everything's[br]all right...

01:45:38.90,01:45:40.60
...I guess I'll just say good night.

01:45:40.80,01:45:41.60
Good night.

01:47:34.40,01:47:36.60
That doesn't prove anything.

01:47:36.60,01:47:38.60
Now what do you think you'll do?

01:47:38.70,01:47:40.50
I'll manage, lovey.

01:47:40.50,01:47:41.90
I suppose you think[br]I'm making all this up.

01:47:42.00,01:47:43.20
I wouldn't know.

01:47:43.50,01:47:45.30
Well, Hazel should know, shouldn't she?

01:47:45.30,01:47:47.80
She worked right in the same studio[br]and that's when it all happened.

01:47:48.00,01:47:50.50
Just after one of those studio parties.

01:47:50.80,01:47:52.50
And right in front of her own house.

01:47:52.80,01:47:56.40
Jane Hudson drove a car straight at her[br]own sister and crippled her for life.

01:47:56.70,01:47:58.50
Come on. You mean,[br]she tried to kill her?

01:47:58.80,01:48:01.70
Yes, she did. She tried[br]to murder her own sister.

01:48:02.00,01:48:03.90
How is it they didn't arrest her then?

01:48:04.10,01:48:06.60
Oh, they would've, but the studio[br]had it all hushed up...

01:48:06.80,01:48:08.70
...on account[br]of Blanche Hudson's career.

01:48:08.90,01:48:10.40
That sounds very likely.

01:48:10.70,01:48:13.40
Yes, doesn't it. So the fine woman[br]you've chosen to run around with...

01:48:13.50,01:48:17.30
...turns out to be broke[br]and a murderer as well.

01:48:17.60,01:48:18.50
Well, it's true.

01:48:18.60,01:48:21.70
All right then, if it's true, I'll ask[br]her about it when I see her again.

01:48:21.90,01:48:24.20
You wouldn't see a woman[br]like that again?

01:48:24.30,01:48:26.30
Why not? You just told me,[br]she's got a rich sister.

01:48:26.40,01:48:29.00
You haven't heard the worst of it yet.

01:48:29.30,01:48:31.20
- You mean there's more?[br]- Yes, there is.

01:48:31.50,01:48:35.90
After she'd run down her own sister,[br]your precious Jane Hudson ran off and...

01:48:36.20,01:48:39.20
...left her there to die,[br]like some poor animal.

01:48:39.50,01:48:42.70
She ran off and disappeared[br]for three whole days.

01:48:42.90,01:48:45.40
So what happened then?[br]Don't tell me they couldn't find her.

01:48:45.70,01:48:48.40
Oh, they found her all right.[br]They found her all right.

01:48:48.70,01:48:51.00
They found her in some hotel room...

01:48:51.20,01:48:53.50
...with a man that she'd[br]never even seen before.

01:48:53.80,01:48:57.00
Why should that upset you?

01:48:58.00,01:49:00.90
Isn't that how I was conceived?

01:49:25.90,01:49:28.00
Yes, this is Ms. Hudson.

01:49:44.20,01:49:46.10
She left.

01:49:49.30,01:49:50.80
About a week ago.

01:49:52.20,01:49:56.40
We have a report here, filed by her[br]cousin, listing her as a missing person.

01:49:56.70,01:49:59.60
Did she tell you what her plans were,[br]anything like that?

01:50:01.80,01:50:04.30
No, I don't know a thing.

01:50:04.50,01:50:06.20
Well, we have a couple of[br]other addresses to check.

01:50:06.30,01:50:07.80
Maybe we'll come up with something.

01:50:07.90,01:50:10.90
Otherwise, we'll probably be[br]getting in touch with you again.

01:50:11.10,01:50:14.50
Meanwhile, if you do hear from her,[br]we would appreciate you letting us know.

01:50:44.20,01:50:47.00
The police are looking for Elvira.

01:50:47.80,01:50:48.90
It wasn't my fault.

01:50:49.20,01:50:52.00
She wouldn't go away, you heard her,[br]she wouldn't leave me alone.

01:50:52.20,01:50:55.90
I don't know what to do, Blanche.[br]What am I going to do?

01:51:01.20,01:51:03.20
What am I going to do?

01:51:06.60,01:51:09.00
If they find her,[br]we'll have to run away.

01:51:09.30,01:51:12.50
That's what we'll do.[br]We'll go away.

01:51:13.80,01:51:16.60
Oh, but then I wouldn't[br]see Edwin anymore.

01:51:16.90,01:51:19.30
He wouldn't like what I did.

01:51:19.60,01:51:23.40
It wasn't my fault,[br]but he wouldn't like it.

01:51:24.60,01:51:25.80
I don't care.

01:51:26.00,01:51:27.60
We'll just go to the beach.

01:51:27.70,01:51:30.00
We'll go and live at the seashore[br]all the time, like we used to...

01:51:30.60,01:51:32.80
...when I was little[br]and Daddy was there.

01:51:33.00,01:51:35.40
And maybe we'll have friends.

01:51:35.70,01:51:39.20
People would come and see us.[br]Oh, I'd like that.

01:51:48.30,01:51:50.30
Blanche, listen to me.

01:51:51.70,01:51:54.40
You know, I always wanted[br]everything to be nice, don't you?

01:51:55.10,01:51:58.10
I don't see how Elvira could[br]make me do a thing like that.

01:51:58.30,01:52:00.30
I just don't understand.

01:52:00.80,01:52:03.10
It was like that time[br]in the hotel room...

01:52:03.40,01:52:07.20
...when they came and told me that[br]you were hurt and that I'd done it.

01:52:07.40,01:52:10.80
And there was a big man there,[br]a policeman.

01:52:11.00,01:52:13.00
And he hit me and[br]he slapped me and...

01:52:13.20,01:52:16.80
...I tried to tell him that[br]I couldn't do a thing like that.

01:52:16.90,01:52:19.30
Not to my own sister.

01:52:26.10,01:52:28.30
He said I was a liar.

01:52:29.70,01:52:31.50
The accident, it...

01:52:32.40,01:52:34.60
No, it wasn't an accident.

01:52:34.80,01:52:38.20
I did it. You told me so yourself.

01:52:42.20,01:52:44.00
I must tell you.

01:52:44.70,01:52:46.80
I don't want to talk about it.

01:52:47.10,01:52:50.40
Every time I think about something nice,[br]you remind me of all the bad things.

01:52:50.60,01:52:53.30
I only want to talk about[br]the nice things.

01:52:58.90,01:53:02.40
Remember when Daddy and I[br]used to rehearse at the beach?

01:53:03.90,01:53:06.20
I'd be dancing on the sand...

01:53:06.90,01:53:09.60
...and all the people[br]would come and watch...

01:53:10.10,01:53:13.80
...all crowd around to see[br]Baby Jane Hudson.

01:53:23.90,01:53:25.30
What'll I do?

01:53:26.30,01:53:28.20
- Let them in.[br]- Oh, but what if...?

01:53:30.00,01:53:32.00
It may be Edwin.

01:53:35.20,01:53:38.00
Of course, Edwin.

01:53:48.00,01:53:50.10
You want to make him tell on me.

01:54:16.60,01:54:18.30
Wait for me!

01:54:29.00,01:54:31.40
I'm sorry, Ms. Hudson but we just[br]picked up this young man...

01:54:31.50,01:54:32.80
...in front of your house.

01:54:32.90,01:54:35.10
Says he's on his way in[br]to see you. Is that right?

01:54:37.30,01:54:38.70
I don't understand.

01:54:38.90,01:54:41.00
They're trying to say I'm drunk.

01:54:41.30,01:54:43.50
Let's just say you're[br]a little happy, okay?

01:54:43.70,01:54:45.40
Who's happy?

01:54:45.90,01:54:47.40
I'm not happy.

01:54:54.70,01:54:55.80
So now you know.

01:54:56.70,01:54:59.10
That's right. So now we know.

01:55:00.20,01:55:02.30
Sorry to have bothered you,[br]Ms. Hudson. Good night.

01:55:26.70,01:55:31.10
I have the money. Really, I have.[br]But don't be mean to me.

01:55:31.60,01:55:33.00
You promised me.

01:55:33.00,01:55:36.20
I know I did, and I have the money.

01:55:36.40,01:55:40.00
Look, let's go in the kitchen[br]and have a drink together.

01:55:40.30,01:55:41.70
It's nice there.[br]And then...

01:55:41.90,01:55:44.80
...we can be friends again,[br]and everything.

01:55:45.40,01:55:46.60
And everything...

01:55:47.00,01:55:48.80
- I've got something else for you, too.[br]- What?

01:55:48.80,01:55:51.80
It's a surprise. Would you like to...?

01:55:59.30,01:56:01.20
You're gonna like your present.

01:56:03.50,01:56:05.50
You're really gonna like it.

01:56:05.70,01:56:07.50
Drink your drink, Edwin.

01:56:11.10,01:56:13.50
I'll go and get it for you.

01:56:44.70,01:56:47.00
This is my very own.

01:56:48.20,01:56:51.10
It's a genuine Baby Jane Doll.

01:56:52.50,01:56:55.60
I used to give them[br]to all my really good friends...

01:56:55.80,01:56:58.70
...the people that I worked with.

01:56:59.00,01:57:00.80
- They made them for me.[br]- Marvelous.

01:57:00.90,01:57:02.30
Specially.

01:57:02.70,01:57:04.30
Very lifelike.

01:57:04.60,01:57:07.70
Now Jane, you talk[br]to nice Mr. Flagg, and...

01:57:08.20,01:57:12.40
...nice Mr. Flagg will have[br]his money in a minute.

01:57:26.10,01:57:29.20
Oh, you're not comfy[br]like that, are you?

01:57:46.90,01:57:48.40
Shall we go bye-bye?

01:58:02.30,01:58:04.60
Here comes the Super Chief.

01:58:17.30,01:58:18.90
What was that?

01:58:19.00,01:58:22.00
Nothing. Nothing.[br]I didn't do anything.

01:58:28.20,01:58:30.80
She'll take you away from me.

01:58:41.50,01:58:43.00
Please...

01:58:44.20,01:58:45.40
...help me.

01:59:01.00,01:59:02.80
She's dying.

01:59:04.90,01:59:07.60
For God's sake.

01:59:09.60,01:59:10.70
She's dying.

01:59:11.60,01:59:13.90
Get away from me![br]Get away from me!

01:59:15.90,01:59:18.70
Edwin, I've got your money.

01:59:21.10,01:59:23.50
Edwin, you forgot your money!

01:59:33.30,01:59:35.20
He hates me.

01:59:41.40,01:59:43.40
He hates me.

02:00:07.30,02:00:09.70
He's going to tell.

02:00:33.10,02:00:35.90
You've got to help me.

02:00:36.70,02:00:38.70
We've got to leave.

02:00:41.40,02:00:43.70
Please, Blanche.

02:00:45.60,02:00:48.30
Help me, please.

02:03:14.50,02:03:17.00
I like this place.

02:03:17.20,02:03:19.80
We can just sit here for a while.

02:03:20.00,02:03:23.90
And pretty soon the sun will[br]come up and it will be nice.

02:03:25.50,02:03:27.90
You should look at the sea.

02:03:28.20,02:03:31.10
It has all lights on it.

02:03:31.50,02:03:33.80
You used to like that.

02:04:02.10,02:04:05.10
We interrupt this program to bring you[br]a special news bulletin.

02:04:05.30,02:04:08.20
At 11:25 this morning all local[br]law-enforcement agencies...

02:04:08.30,02:04:09.60
...had assigned special details...

02:04:09.70,02:04:13.40
...to the kidnap-slaying mystery that[br]surrounds the famed Hudson sisters.

02:04:13.70,02:04:16.60
It is believed that Blanche Hudson,[br]film great of the early Thirties...

02:04:16.90,02:04:18.90
...has been forcibly abducted[br]by her sister...

02:04:18.90,02:04:21.00
...former child star,[br]Baby Jane Hudson...

02:04:21.20,02:04:23.60
...from the family home on[br]Northwood Avenue in Hollywood...

02:04:23.70,02:04:27.10
...sometime between the hours of[br]10:00 p.m. And 10:30 p.m. Last evening.

02:04:27.80,02:04:29.60
With the exception of one witness...

02:04:29.70,02:04:33.50
...who reportedly saw the Hudson car,[br]a 1940 or 1941 black convertible...

02:04:33.70,02:04:36.00
...heading west on Wilshire[br]and Santa Monica...

02:04:36.30,02:04:38.80
...no report has been received.

02:05:07.80,02:05:09.80
I see you found that colored woman.

02:05:10.00,02:05:11.20
They found her all right.

02:05:11.60,02:05:14.50
Sure is a rotten way to get[br]your picture in the papers.

02:05:15.00,02:05:17.50
You reckon you'll ever find that[br]Baby Jane, or whatever her name is?

02:05:17.80,02:05:20.90
Sure, we'll find her.[br]But I guess maybe it'll be too late.

02:05:57.50,02:06:00.50
Oh, officer, there's a car down there[br]parked right out in the road.

02:06:00.80,02:06:03.10
I almost got stuck in the sand[br]when I tried to get around it.

02:06:03.80,02:06:06.40
- You mean that old Lincoln convertible?[br]- That's right.

02:06:06.80,02:06:09.80
That was parked there when[br]we opened up this morning.

02:06:10.20,02:06:12.60
The keys are there, but I didn't want[br]to move it. I thought maybe...

02:06:14.90,02:06:16.20
How do you figure?

02:06:16.50,02:06:18.90
Cops. How do you figure cops?

02:06:33.10,02:06:34.10
This is it.

02:07:06.40,02:07:08.20
You must be hot.

02:07:16.10,02:07:17.60
Help me.

02:07:19.30,02:07:20.90
I'm afraid.

02:07:26.10,02:07:28.00
Find someone...

02:07:29.50,02:07:30.40
...a doctor.

02:07:31.00,02:07:32.60
I can't.

02:07:35.20,02:07:36.70
If I die...

02:07:39.10,02:07:40.40
...you'll be alone.

02:07:40.60,02:07:42.70
But they'd be mean to me,[br]like they were before.

02:07:44.20,02:07:46.10
They'll be kind.

02:07:48.10,02:07:50.00
I don't want to hear.

02:07:51.80,02:07:53.40
Jane, I'm dying.

02:07:54.80,02:07:57.10
There's no time.

02:07:57.80,02:07:59.80
You must listen.

02:08:00.50,02:08:02.00
I made you...

02:08:02.50,02:08:04.70
...waste your whole life...

02:08:05.90,02:08:08.50
...thinking you'd crippled me.

02:08:08.70,02:08:10.40
Please, stop.

02:08:12.50,02:08:15.10
You didn't do it.

02:08:17.50,02:08:19.90
I did it myself.

02:08:21.80,02:08:23.80
Don't you understand?

02:08:25.40,02:08:28.70
I crippled myself.

02:08:29.70,02:08:31.00
You weren't driving...

02:08:31.10,02:08:33.00
...that night.

02:09:00.50,02:09:03.00
You weren't driving.

02:09:04.40,02:09:06.30
You were too drunk.

02:09:06.60,02:09:08.80
I wouldn't let you drive.

02:09:10.70,02:09:13.60
I made you go open the gates.

02:09:14.00,02:09:16.70
I watched you get out of the car.

02:09:18.10,02:09:21.10
You'd been so cruel to me at the party.

02:09:22.20,02:09:23.90
Imitating me...

02:09:24.40,02:09:26.90
...making people laugh at me.

02:09:27.70,02:09:30.10
I watched you get out of the car and...

02:09:31.60,02:09:34.20
...I wanted to run you down...

02:09:34.50,02:09:36.30
...crush you.

02:09:37.00,02:09:39.40
You saw the car coming.

02:09:42.00,02:09:44.00
I hit the gates.

02:09:49.10,02:09:51.80
Snapped my spine.

02:09:53.30,02:09:55.10
Then, you mean...

02:09:58.10,02:10:02.20
...all this time[br]we could've been friends?

02:10:03.80,02:10:07.80
You were frightened and ran away.

02:10:09.70,02:10:13.70
I managed to crawl out[br]of the car and up to the gates.

02:10:14.40,02:10:16.40
When they found me...

02:10:17.10,02:10:19.90
...they assumed it was your fault.

02:10:22.40,02:10:25.90
Oh, you were so drunk and confused.

02:10:26.20,02:10:28.10
You didn't know any better.

02:10:32.40,02:10:35.00
You weren't ugly then.

02:10:36.10,02:10:38.40
I made you that way.

02:10:40.00,02:10:42.70
I even did that.

02:10:45.20,02:10:48.20
There's a place up there[br]that sells things.

02:10:51.50,02:10:53.70
You like ice cream.

02:10:57.00,02:10:59.00
I'll get you some.

02:11:13.40,02:11:14.90
Do you have ice cream?

02:11:15.10,02:11:16.00
Yes, what flavor?

02:11:19.60,02:11:22.00
Vanilla, coffee, strawberry, lemon...

02:11:22.30,02:11:25.40
Strawberry. Strawberry, please.[br]Two big strawberries, please.

02:11:35.10,02:11:37.70
- That'll be forty cents.[br]- Thanks.

02:11:39.60,02:11:42.70
Right. You better send some more help.

02:11:53.30,02:11:55.00
We've been looking all over for you.

02:11:55.60,02:11:57.60
I'm sorry, but we must find your sister.

02:12:02.00,02:12:03.70
Is she down here on the beach with you?

02:12:04.20,02:12:06.10
- Yes, she is.[br]- I'll take these for you.

02:12:06.20,02:12:09.40
Oh, no, they're mine.[br]They're for my sister, Blanche.

02:12:09.90,02:12:11.80
She's going to be[br]a movie star, you know.

02:12:12.40,02:12:13.40
That's right, miss.

02:12:13.80,02:12:17.20
We want to find your sister, because[br]I think maybe she needs help.

02:12:17.40,02:12:18.80
I think maybe she's in trouble.

02:12:18.80,02:12:21.20
Won't you show us where she is, please?

02:12:21.70,02:12:24.30
Won't you take us to her?[br]Please, Ms. Hudson.
