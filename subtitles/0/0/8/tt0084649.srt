00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,858
Jonathan Brisby was killed today while helping with the Plan

3
00:00:56,339 --> 00:01:00,775
It is four years since our departure from NIMH

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,177
and our world is changing

5
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,608
We cannot stay here much longer

6
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,942
Jonathan was a dear friend

7
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,404
I am lost in knowing how to help his widow.

8
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:25,933
She knows nothing of us, or the Plan

9
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,015
Perhaps best that I do nothing at present

10
00:01:36,586 --> 00:01:38,325
I shall miss him

11
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,255
Johnason

12
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,028
wherever you are

13
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:51,837
your thoughts must comfort her tonight

14
00:01:53,268 --> 00:01:58,405
She'll be waiting, and you will not return.

15
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:15,894
Farewell...my friend

16
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,944
Mr. Ages?

17
00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:45,789
Mr. Ages, is anybody home?

18
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,611
Go away!

19
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,736
Mr. Ages!

20
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:52,953
What is it?

21
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,553
Mr. Ages, may I please speak to you?

22
00:03:56,554 --> 00:03:57,554
What?

23
00:03:57,555 --> 00:04:00,579
I said, may I please speak...

24
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,922
with you

25
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:05,162
Oh, thank goodness

26
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:07,080
I'm so glad you're home

27
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:10,456
Confounded machine!

28
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:12,792
You never know when it's going to up and blow!

29
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:13,326
yes

30
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,924
I don't suppose you would remember me..

31
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:18,309
Yes, you're Mrs. Brisby.

32
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:20,814
And I am sorry about your husband's death.

33
00:04:21,114 --> 00:04:23,008
Now if you'll excuse me...

34
00:04:23,093 --> 00:04:24,663
Mr. Ages!

35
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:26,889
Great Jupiter woman, what do you want?

36
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:29,052
Mr. Ages, I know you don't like visitors

37
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:30,700
but this is an emergency!

38
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:32,399
Please!

39
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:46,060
Madam, that is an emergency.

40
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:49,532
Oh Mr. Ages, my son Timothy is so sick!

41
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:52,116
Timmy? The one with the spider bite?

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,812
Oh, just give him some pepsissiwa root and...

43
00:04:55,813 --> 00:04:57,001
No!

44
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,606
No, he's sick with a fever!

45
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:02,217
Well...I suppose I could fix up something...

46
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:03,097
Oh thank you!

47
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:05,375
Follow me, but don't touch anything!

48
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,687
Understand?

49
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:09,694
I do appreciate it...

50
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:11,221
Just how high is his fever?

51
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:12,571
He's burning hot to the touch.

52
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:13,782
Hmmmmmm, yes.

53
00:05:13,782 --> 00:05:15,462
He's soaking wet with perspiration...

54
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:15,977
..yes?

55
00:05:15,977 --> 00:05:18,028
...and there's a raspy sound when he breathes.

56
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:20,569
A raspy sound you say? Well..

57
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:24,995
Does he have a chill?

58
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:26,010
Yes, he does.

59
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:27,925
Have you wrapped him in a blanket?

60
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:28,566
Yes.

61
00:05:29,385 --> 00:05:31,411
Now step inside, but keep your hands to yourself!

62
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:35,498
I'm right in the middle of...something very important.

63
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:36,210
I understand.

64
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,196
Oh, do you?

65
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,134
Look at this mess...

66
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:44,037
Oh, shoo, shoo, go on!

67
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:47,895
Your son has pneumonia.

68
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:48,724
Pneumonia?

69
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,425
It's not uncommon, but you can die from it.

70
00:05:52,157 --> 00:05:53,187
Oh please dear God, no.

71
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:56,123
Your son must stay in bed. Bundle him up.

72
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:56,802
Yes.

73
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:01,426
Not to go outside...

74
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:02,401
But how long must...

75
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:03,213
Three weeks.

76
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:07,119
He cannot be moved for at least three weeks.

77
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,730
But Moving Day is nearly here!

78
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:11,831
You asked my advice, and I gave it to you!

79
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:12,667
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:13,859
He must stay in bed.

81
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:18,532
Now, mix this...this powder in a broth and make him drink it.

82
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:19,754
It'll bring down the fever.

83
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,800
Oh, bless you sir!

84
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,225
And bless yourself, you'll need it.

85
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:25,822
Now, you must excuse me...

86
00:06:25,822 --> 00:06:26,986
You know the way out.

87
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,395
Oh, of course.

88
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,787
Thank you once again...

89
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:32,119
Shoo shoo shoo. Go on now. Go on.

90
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:33,107
Thank you so....

91
00:06:34,031 --> 00:06:37,925
...much. Goodbye.

92
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,000
Is everything all right here?

93
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:13,588
What the...
Oh! Lady, don't sneak up on me like that!

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,813
I didn't mean to frighten you...

95
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:20,018
Oh, you didn't frighten me, I was just sort of...

96
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:21,345
working out.

97
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:23,888
You just broke my concentration, that's...

98
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:25,888
You look more like you're all tangled up.

99
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:27,817
Er, yeah

100
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:29,861
I guess that's enough exercise for one day.

101
00:07:29,862 --> 00:07:33,482
Besides, I'm really after this terrific string!

102
00:07:33,482 --> 00:07:35,642
I'm working on a love nest for two.

103
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:37,016
You know what I mean?

104
00:07:37,017 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh I see...

105
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,362
you have a girl.

106
00:07:40,363 --> 00:07:42,100
Well, not really, I mean...

107
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,734
I haven't found Miss Right yet.

108
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:45,004
But when I do

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,389
the whole world will hear us singing.....

110
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:54,010
Excuse me, pardon me.

111
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:58,578
Well, you keep making all that noise and Dragon will hear you.

112
00:07:58,579 --> 00:07:59,992
If he hasn't already.

113
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:01,787
Wouldn't you sing too? I mean

114
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:03,827
if you felt... heh heh ...

115
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:06,809
if you felt the call of the wild, but...

116
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,765
I would... I would not

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,709
if I knew there was a cat nearby.

118
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:12,360
but..

119
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:15,483
but SHE'S out there...somewhere...

120
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:20,060
and when I find her I'll feel
it way down in my wishbone!

121
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:21,231
I...What cat?

122
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:24,334
Dragon! He belongs to Farmer Fitzgibbons.

123
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:28,213
Look towards the house. See
if you can see him.

124
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:32,824
Come back down here!

125
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:34,629
He'll see you for sure up there!

126
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,059
Hey, there's a cat out there!

127
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,400
Quiet! Does he see you?

128
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:40,627
No.

129
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,619
Yes!

130
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,975
Stand perfectly still.

131
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:48,118
Everything's fine...he's headed right for us.

132
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:50,303
Don't panic! Fast or slow?

133
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:53,868
Medium. Make that fast. Very f...

134
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:56,559
I have to go now! Excuse me, I really....

135
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,584
Break!

136
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,328
Oh my goodness.

137
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,861
It's a rabbit!

138
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,104
Well of all the silly nincompoops!

139
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:34,072
You got yourself all worked up over a rabbit!

140
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:37,060
You should have seen yourself!

141
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:38,604
Will you keep quiet?

142
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:40,861
You were scared stiff!

143
00:09:40,862 --> 00:09:43,155
A rabbit! I knew it all along!

144
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:45,769
Will you hush up?

145
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:49,000
Admit it! You were scared!

146
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:52,219
Oh...fiddlesticks. Hold still.

147
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,974
If I had actually been near a cat, I'd be sneezing my brains out.

148
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:57,639
See, I'm allergic to ca...

149
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,558
I'm allergic to caaaaa...

150
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,308
I'm allergic to caaaaa...

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,917
I'm allerg...AHHH-CHOOOO!

152
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,336
Excuse me, pardon me.

153
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,954
The string, quick! Grab the string!

154
00:11:44,794 --> 00:11:47,800
Hey, Miss Mouse, don't worry, I'm ok.

155
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:52,800
See? I'm alright.

156
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:54,979
That's not the reason I'm crying.

157
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,757
I lost Timmy's medicine.

158
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:01,496
Aw, don't cry. I hate to see a woman cry...

159
00:12:02,327 --> 00:12:05,676
Hey! Was I great, or was I
great? Did you see that cat out there?

160
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:09,976
All dripping, and...and wet.....with water....

161
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:15,304
I'll...go back to Mr. Ages tommorow, and....

162
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:16,305
You weren't so bad yourself.

163
00:12:16,306 --> 00:12:18,225
Hey, we make a pretty good team!

164
00:12:18,225 --> 00:12:20,046
Oh, here, you dropped this back there.

165
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:23,054
Nobody messes with ol' Jeremy, boy. Nobody!

166
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:26,667
That's it! Timmy's medicine!

167
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:30,387
Oh, thank you! Thank you so much!

168
00:12:30,864 --> 00:12:35,025
Huh? It i... what? It is? I mean, it is.

169
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:37,553
Well, I saw it lying there, and I said uh......

170
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,830
My name is Jeremy.

171
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:44,061
I'm Mrs. Brisby.

172
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:45,062
Thanks again!

173
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:47,680
I have to go home now.

174
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:50,958
Uh, where's home?

175
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:54,227
In the garden patch, by the stone.

176
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:57,557
do you like me?

177
00:12:57,558 --> 00:13:00,000
Of course I like you!

178
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:00,959
Bye now.

179
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,730
No! I mean...I mean, um....I mean

180
00:13:03,765 --> 00:13:05,811
you don't think I'm clumsy or anything?

181
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,291
Oh...sorry. Excuse me, pardon me.

182
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:15,568
Oh. Well, if you're going to feather a nest

183
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:18,574
you've got a lot to learn about how to treat a lady!

184
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:21,016
Right. When you're right, you're right.

185
00:13:21,328 --> 00:13:22,523
And you're right.

186
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,338
None of the girls I meet want to get serious!

187
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:27,514
I doubt they'd survive.

188
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:30,433
Huh? Maybe it's my approach.

189
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,733
Say! You were a girl once!

190
00:13:32,734 --> 00:13:34,493
You could teach me how to...

191
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:35,338
you know, how to.....

192
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:36,778
Behave yourself?

193
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,741
I'm not that bad!

194
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:41,897
I just need a few pointers to polish my style.

195
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:46,025
Jeremy, I have got to go home!

196
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,364
Well let me...Let me fly you home!

197
00:13:48,365 --> 00:13:49,643
We can talk on the way!

198
00:13:49,644 --> 00:13:53,849
Oh, no thank you. I'm afraid of heights.

199
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,367
OK, then we'll walk.

200
00:13:56,772 --> 00:13:57,873
Bye now.

201
00:14:11,236 --> 00:14:12,555
I think I got real potential

202
00:14:12,556 --> 00:14:14,892
I mean, girls go for the athletic type, don't they?

203
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,117
Jeremy, you're stepping on my tail.

204
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,064
Excuse me, pardon me...

205
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,453
Maybe I should go look for Mom.

206
00:14:28,787 --> 00:14:30,705
I don't think so, Martin.

207
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:34,089
Brisby! Briiiiiisby!

208
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,138
Oh! Auntie Shrew!

209
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:37,502
Oh Auntie!

210
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:38,826
Oh no....

211
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,352
She'll wake up Timothy!

212
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:44,945
She's not here

213
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,986
Why is she always coming around here,
poking her nose in where she's not wanted?

214
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:52,498
Martin!

215
00:14:56,824 --> 00:15:00,610
Thank you child. I must speak with your mother.

216
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,144
Your Auntie is exhausted!

217
00:15:05,868 --> 00:15:14,187
Why me? That I alone should be responsible
for the welfare of the entire field is monstrous!

218
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:15,848
Brisby!

219
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,080
mother isn't here

220
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:19,875
Auntie Shrew, Timmy's sick!

221
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:22,992
Cynthia dearest, don't pull me.

222
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:25,622
She's not here?

223
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:28,292
She left you children alone then?

224
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:29,478
I'm old enough.

225
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:32,964
...rats in the field up to heaven knows what sort of mischief...

226
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,134
Cynthia dear, don't fidgit!

227
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,837
You're so like your mother!

228
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:38,397
I ain't scared of nuthin!

229
00:15:38,398 --> 00:15:40,521
She went to see Mr. Ages.

230
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,429
To Ages? That old flim-flam!

231
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,452
Whatever for?

232
00:15:44,453 --> 00:15:46,465
Auntie Shrew, Timmy's sick!

233
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:48,353
Patience, my pet.

234
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:50,223
Why to Ages?

235
00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:52,884
-Timmy's sick!
-Timothy is very ill.

236
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,544
Timmy ill? How dreadful!

237
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:57,458
I'm not afraid of the dark!

238
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm not afraid of the farmer!

239
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:00,962
I can't hear!

240
00:16:00,963 --> 00:16:02,625
I'm not even scared of Dragon.

241
00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:06,486
I'm not even afraid of...of...of the Great Owl!

242
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:07,436
Will you hush up?

243
00:16:07,436 --> 00:16:08,527
Aw, you hush up!

244
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:09,328
Martin!

245
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:10,612
Precocious monster!

246
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:12,121
Bossing bullfrog!

247
00:16:12,122 --> 00:16:13,687
Spoiled brat!

248
00:16:13,688 --> 00:16:14,960
Loudmouth!

249
00:16:17,398 --> 00:16:20,475
That will be quite enough, thank you!

250
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:28,214
Cast not pearls before swine, I always say...

251
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:33,074
and that includes impudent piglets! Good day!

252
00:16:37,902 --> 00:16:40,463
Oh! You impertinent little...

253
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:43,413
Martin! Auntie Shrew, what's going on!?

254
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:44,485
Indeed!

255
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:46,903
Please...come back inside...

256
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:48,590
Not for a king's ransom!

257
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,535
I have just one thing to say

258
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:52,653
That child is a brat!

259
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:54,502
Yes, I will speak to him.

260
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:56,229
I came here to inform you...

261
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,216
that the frost is off the ground...

262
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,276
and Moving Day is at hand.

263
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:05,014
Prepare to move your very very odd family.

264
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:06,532
Good day.

265
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:10,444
You never know what might be lurking about out here

266
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:12,114
what with rats and.....

267
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:15,194
Well, children. now you've done it.

268
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,195
It was Martin.

269
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,950
The Shrew means well.

270
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:20,654
She only wants to help.

271
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,667
Gosh, I'm sorry, Mom.

272
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,386
# Dream by night, wish by day #

273
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:46,872
# Love begins this way #

274
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:52,614
# Night's a friend with love to send #

275
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:57,208
# Each new day #

276
00:17:57,803 --> 00:18:02,499
# Bless your heart, bless your soul #

277
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,982
# Let your dreams come true #

278
00:18:07,332 --> 00:18:12,699
# Future songs and flying dreams #

279
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:16,697
# Wait for you #

280
00:18:16,924 --> 00:18:18,456
# Love it seems #

281
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,552
# made flying dreams #

282
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:25,232
# So hearts could soar #

283
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:27,724
# Heaven sent #

284
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,386
# these wings were meant #

285
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:34,952
# to prove once more #

286
00:18:34,987 --> 00:18:40,780
# that love is the key #

287
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:45,255
Is Timmy gonna die?

288
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:48,731
No, sweetheart. He's just very sick.

289
00:18:48,732 --> 00:18:50,584
What's the matter with him, Mother?

290
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:53,952
Mr. Ages called it...pneumonia.

291
00:18:53,953 --> 00:18:54,953
pneumonia?

292
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:58,459
When will he get better?

293
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,704
Soon....I hope.

294
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:06,794
# As you wish, as you will #

295
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:10,882
# Dreaming a flying star #

296
00:19:11,414 --> 00:19:16,072
# Love and care, the power is there #

297
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:20,692
# Trust your heart #

298
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,127
# Trust your heart #

299
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,309
Off to bed with you now.

300
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,592
Dear, a man came by today, from NIMH.

301
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:49,813
NIMH?

302
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:50,768
Yes, you know!

303
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,126
The National Institute of Mental Health.

304
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,567
He was asking if we had noticed...

305
00:19:55,602 --> 00:19:58,403
anything strange...about the rats on the farm

306
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,356
Well, I said 'No, nothing unusual.'

307
00:20:01,357 --> 00:20:04,166
Beth, I have to get up early.

308
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,911
Oh, it gave me goosebumps to hear him carry on that way!

309
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:09,512
Like the rats might have some horrible disease!

310
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:10,555
Night, Beth...

311
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,551
I told him you'd call him back.

312
00:21:00,947 --> 00:21:04,141
What did I tell you? Moving!

313
00:21:04,142 --> 00:21:05,038
It can't be!

314
00:21:05,143 --> 00:21:06,347
It certainly can!

315
00:21:06,382 --> 00:21:08,390
I don't suppose you've packed!

316
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:09,828
What about Timmy?

317
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:12,247
The chill in the air could kill him!

318
00:21:12,282 --> 00:21:14,908
Well child, that tractor surely will.

319
00:21:14,943 --> 00:21:18,168
For the last time, get your children out of here

320
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,298
before it's too late!

321
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:30,856
Run! The plow is here, run!

322
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:33,319
It's Moving Day!

323
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,214
Run!

324
00:21:40,318 --> 00:21:41,674
The plow is here!

325
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:44,052
Run!

326
00:21:55,418 --> 00:21:57,447
Run! Get out!

327
00:22:16,765 --> 00:22:17,801
Brisby!

328
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:20,855
Go get...Timothy!

329
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:23,003
Please! Take the children out of here!

330
00:22:23,004 --> 00:22:24,152
Mommy, we can't leave Timmy!

331
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:25,594
Go with Auntie Shrew.

332
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:27,794
I've got to try to stop that thing!

333
00:22:27,852 --> 00:22:30,523
Wait! You're out of your mind!

334
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:32,723
Brisby, come back!

335
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,531
Brisby! Hang on!

336
00:23:01,532 --> 00:23:02,815
Hang on!

337
00:23:41,743 --> 00:23:42,916
Brisby!

338
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,538
Come on! Come on!

339
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,752
Well of all the rotten luck...

340
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,759
fuel line's cut.

341
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,627
He'll come back tomorrow...

342
00:24:00,494 --> 00:24:02,769
I wish Jonathan were here.

343
00:24:03,686 --> 00:24:04,888
Well, he's not.

344
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:08,594
Stop it!

345
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,446
What am I going to do?

346
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:15,674
We'll think of something.

347
00:24:16,215 --> 00:24:18,494
Come on, let's get out of here.

348
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,382
The Great Owl would know what to do about this.

349
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,284
You must go see him.

350
00:24:29,858 --> 00:24:30,901
Oh I...I couldn't do that.

351
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,720
Owls eat mice!

352
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,033
Well my child, show a little courage!

353
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:38,399
We're fighting for Timmy's life!

354
00:24:39,905 --> 00:24:44,277
Jonathan, your wife, I fear..

355
00:24:44,312 --> 00:24:45,808
is in desperate trouble.

356
00:24:47,183 --> 00:24:51,212
A visit to the Great Owl
may indeed be profitable.

357
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,452
Go to the Owl then, Mrs. Brisby.

358
00:24:59,227 --> 00:25:00,591
Go there!

359
00:25:14,378 --> 00:25:15,508
Nice evening huh?

360
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:17,279
I told you you'd love flying.

361
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,075
I don't know how
I let you talk me into this!

362
00:25:20,123 --> 00:25:22,117
Aw, don't thank me, Mrs. Briz.

363
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:26,309
When we get to the Great Owl

364
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,106
he'll know just what to
do about everything!

365
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:31,217
Owls eat mice!

366
00:25:31,218 --> 00:25:34,587
Ummmm...only after dark....

367
00:26:05,143 --> 00:26:08,071
That must be the Owl's tree over there.

368
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,550
Hello?

369
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:40,095
Hello?

370
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,317
Anybody home?

371
00:26:43,015 --> 00:26:44,899
Well, the place looks deserted.

372
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,048
I guess we'd better get outta here.

373
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,192
Step inside my house....

374
00:27:14,857 --> 00:27:18,029
Come inside, or go away.

375
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:30,000
Timothy...remember Timothy.

376
00:28:43,268 --> 00:28:44,773
Why have you come?

377
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:52,300
Please forgive me for disturbing you...

378
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,455
but my son's life is in great danger.

379
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,299
The plow has come early this year and...

380
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:07,649
Move your family.

381
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:16,205
Yes...I would move,

382
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,548
but Timothy has pneumonia.

383
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:21,088
He can't even get out of bed.

384
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,954
You must move it to a place
where it will be safe from the plow.

385
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,305
Please...there must be another way.

386
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,957
There is no other way.

387
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:40,827
I must bid you good evening, Mrs...?

388
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:42,530
Mrs. Brisby.

389
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,206
Brisby? Mrs. Jonathan Brisby?

390
00:29:48,129 --> 00:29:51,054
Why yes! He was my husband!

391
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,640
But...how do you know about him?

392
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:56,192
That is not important.

393
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,894
I will say this...

394
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:04,026
his name is not unknown in these woods.

395
00:30:04,061 --> 00:30:05,375
Please sir...

396
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,957
I'll do anything to save Timmy.

397
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,789
Anything.

398
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,895
There is a way.

399
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,187
Go to the rats.

400
00:30:17,222 --> 00:30:19,171
But I don't know any rats!

401
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,618
In the rosebush.

402
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,731
Oh yes...

403
00:30:23,311 --> 00:30:24,845
near the farmhouse.

404
00:30:24,984 --> 00:30:26,351
Go there.

405
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,765
Ask for Nicodemus.

406
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,628
Nicodemus?

407
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,338
But how can they help?

408
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:38,472
They must move your house
to the lee of the stone.

409
00:30:38,507 --> 00:30:41,188
No rat could move my house! It's...

410
00:30:41,223 --> 00:30:43,387
They have ways!

411
00:30:44,598 --> 00:30:46,170
I don't understand...

412
00:30:46,205 --> 00:30:48,029
but I will do as you say.

413
00:30:48,532 --> 00:30:52,049
It is night. I must go.

414
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:09,496
Remember...the lee of the stone.

415
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:22,978
What...what did he say?

416
00:31:23,803 --> 00:31:26,082
He said to go to the rats.

417
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,670
Rats. What rats?

418
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:34,480
The lee of the stone....

419
00:32:02,806 --> 00:32:04,432
Mrs. Briz! Briz!

420
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:08,151
Oh, excuse me, pardon me.

421
00:32:08,186 --> 00:32:11,598
Jeremy? What on earth?

422
00:32:11,982 --> 00:32:14,371
I'm in disguise!

423
00:32:14,372 --> 00:32:17,866
Jeremy, please, not now!

424
00:32:18,613 --> 00:32:20,571
I'm trying to find the entrance,

425
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,023
and these thorns are very dense.

426
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:23,104
Here, let me help you...

427
00:32:24,505 --> 00:32:26,038
Will you be quiet?

428
00:32:26,385 --> 00:32:27,427
They'll hear you!

429
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:30,625
I've got to find this Nicodemus

430
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,425
before the farmer gets that tractor fixed!

431
00:32:33,426 --> 00:32:34,601
I'll keep a lookout!

432
00:32:37,827 --> 00:32:41,698
Will you...! You're going to get us both killed!

433
00:32:41,699 --> 00:32:43,141
I don't see anybody coming.

434
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,936
If you really wanted to help me,

435
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:48,394
you'd go away.

436
00:32:48,395 --> 00:32:50,133
Why that's very brave of you, Mrs. Briz

437
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:55,065
but I can't....I can't leave you here alone.

438
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,495
Why, if anything were to happen,

439
00:32:56,602 --> 00:32:58,495
think...think of the children!

440
00:32:59,126 --> 00:32:59,994
That's it!

441
00:32:59,994 --> 00:33:01,246
huh? That's what?

442
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:02,380
Jeremy

443
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:06,196
someone strong should be protecting my children.

444
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:08,633
In case that tractor starts up again.

445
00:33:08,634 --> 00:33:10,603
Oh, in case the tra...

446
00:33:10,604 --> 00:33:12,842
Hey! How 'bout me?

447
00:33:12,843 --> 00:33:14,737
Oh, would you?

448
00:33:14,772 --> 00:33:17,618
Yeah, sure! That'd be terrific practice!

449
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:19,934
Girls can't resist a guy who's good with kids,

450
00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:21,244
you know, domestic type.

451
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,786
Play games, help out, domestic!

452
00:33:22,787 --> 00:33:24,559
Yes. Yes, domestic.

453
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,070
Now whatever you do
don't tell them where I am.

454
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:29,600
My lips are sealed, Mrs. Briz.

455
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:30,572
Bye.

456
00:33:31,115 --> 00:33:32,602
Good luck with the rats!

457
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:41,285
Where do you live?

458
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,879
By that big stone in the garden.

459
00:33:43,914 --> 00:33:45,952
Just stay out of trouble?

460
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,132
Not to worry, Mrs. Briz.

461
00:33:47,363 --> 00:33:49,123
I love kids and kids love me.

462
00:33:49,175 --> 00:33:52,523
Kids love me and I love kids

463
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:08,927
Dragon! You lazy kitty!

464
00:34:08,962 --> 00:34:11,391
Go catch some of those
rats out in the barn!

465
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:14,210
I've never seen a cat sleep so much.

466
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:02,873
Er....hello.

467
00:36:03,749 --> 00:36:05,780
I'm...I'm Mrs. Brisby.

468
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:09,979
Umm...I was told to see Nicodemus.

469
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,215
Are you Nicodemus?

470
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:16,419
Please, I need help!

471
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,444
Who goes there?

472
00:36:58,479 --> 00:36:59,421
Me!

473
00:36:59,422 --> 00:37:01,217
Mrs...Brisby?

474
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:04,808
what are you doing here?

475
00:37:04,824 --> 00:37:08,370
Oh! Oh thank goodness it's you!

476
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:10,511
How in thunder did you get in here?

477
00:37:10,546 --> 00:37:13,167
The plow has come early to the field....

478
00:37:13,202 --> 00:37:15,737
you had better march straight
back out the way you came!

479
00:37:15,772 --> 00:37:19,921
...I can't bring Timothy out.
The chill in the air will kill him!

480
00:37:19,956 --> 00:37:22,000
That's another matter.
That doesn't explain what you're doing here.

481
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:23,595
...and that big rat chased me away.

482
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,123
But I must see Nicodemus!

483
00:37:26,158 --> 00:37:28,997
The Owl told me to see Nicodemus!

484
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:30,206
Well, yes, perhaps you should....

485
00:37:32,023 --> 00:37:33,976
The owl said?

486
00:37:35,581 --> 00:37:36,607
Here now, what owl?

487
00:37:36,642 --> 00:37:38,194
What are you talking about?

488
00:37:38,229 --> 00:37:40,779
I went to see the Great Owl.

489
00:37:40,814 --> 00:37:46,000
The Owl? You say you saw...the Owl?

490
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:49,805
Yes, and he said I should ask for Nicodemus.

491
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,610
Er, yes, I know Nicodemus.

492
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:52,887
He lives with the rats.

493
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:54,501
More specifically, he is the leader of the rats.

494
00:37:54,502 --> 00:37:55,456
You know him?

495
00:37:55,456 --> 00:37:58,032
No one has ever seen the Owl...

496
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,640
and lived to tell about it!

497
00:38:00,675 --> 00:38:03,810
Please...could you take me to see Nicodemus?

498
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:04,763
Well...

499
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:09,883
ye-e-ess, yes.

500
00:38:09,918 --> 00:38:13,283
But for your sake, I hope you're telling the truth!

501
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:15,300
Come on.

502
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:18,977
What about the large rat at the entrance?

503
00:38:19,012 --> 00:38:21,701
I can't go back there. I can't.

504
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:25,266
Oh, that's just Brutus. Follow me.

505
00:38:27,257 --> 00:38:29,586
Well? Come on!

506
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,978
Jonathan, your wife has come at last.

507
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,211
Perhaps now I can repay you
for your kindness to me.

508
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:51,065
Yet Mrs. Brisby, who served the rats
of NIMH far more than we her

509
00:38:52,573 --> 00:38:56,699
Jenner I fear may do her harm...

510
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,357
He is consumed by a lust for power.

511
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:07,192
Thus far, the amulet has remained safely hidden.

512
00:39:08,065 --> 00:39:09,819
But if he finds it...

513
00:39:11,438 --> 00:39:13,026
heaven help us.

514
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:24,021
Forgive me, I just noticed you're limping.

515
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,745
That's none of your affair.

516
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,294
Now, to what you are
about to see and hear

517
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:32,244
you must swear absolute secrecy.

518
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,463
-Yes, I unders...
-Swear it!

519
00:39:34,464 --> 00:39:35,547
I promise.

520
00:39:36,732 --> 00:39:38,461
If any of this ever got out

521
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:41,570
we'd have humankind bulldozing
their way down here

522
00:39:41,605 --> 00:39:43,559
to blow the place apart.

523
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,057
Is it always so dark?

524
00:39:45,058 --> 00:39:46,929
We're down three feet.

525
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:56,659
It's the most beautiful sight I've ever seen!

526
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:13,969
Reveal thy name!

527
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,514
Justin, you featherhead!

528
00:40:16,822 --> 00:40:17,953
Get your hands off me!

529
00:40:17,954 --> 00:40:21,267
Ok, ok, just a joke! I didn't mean any harm.

530
00:40:21,762 --> 00:40:23,268
The meeting's already in progress.

531
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:24,656
What's this all about?

532
00:40:24,736 --> 00:40:26,198
Who, may I ask?

533
00:40:26,233 --> 00:40:28,194
Yes, yes, she can be trusted.

534
00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:29,503
This is no stranger.

535
00:40:29,538 --> 00:40:31,960
My dear, may I present Justin,

536
00:40:31,995 --> 00:40:34,150
the Captain of the Guard.

537
00:40:34,185 --> 00:40:35,630
Justin, Mrs. Brisby.

538
00:40:35,665 --> 00:40:39,082
Not...Mrs. Jonathan Brisby!

539
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:39,563
Yes, the same.

540
00:40:39,598 --> 00:40:43,287
It is an honor and a privilege, milady.

541
00:40:43,322 --> 00:40:45,970
If we could dispense with the formalities...?

542
00:40:46,005 --> 00:40:47,412
How beautiful...

543
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:48,263
Ma'am?

544
00:40:48,298 --> 00:40:51,488
Oh! Er...the lights! They're quite lovely.

545
00:40:51,523 --> 00:40:52,797
Yes, they are.

546
00:40:52,832 --> 00:40:55,400
We've had electricity for four years now.

547
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:56,096
Five.

548
00:40:56,173 --> 00:40:58,527
Jonathan often spoke of electricity.

549
00:40:58,614 --> 00:41:01,607
But you see, our shame is that we're stealing it

550
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:03,459
from Farmer Fitzgibbons.

551
00:41:03,763 --> 00:41:04,472
Stealing?

552
00:41:04,473 --> 00:41:05,952
All of that is going to change.

553
00:41:06,027 --> 00:41:07,600
He means we're working on a Plan.

554
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:09,592
I mean, that we have a Plan.

555
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:11,686
And this stealing will stop.

556
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,474
Now...

557
00:41:14,299 --> 00:41:16,238
Oh yes. Why did you send for me?

558
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:22,306
It's Jenner. He's at it again.

559
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:24,192
Hmmm. There blows an ill wind.

560
00:41:25,084 --> 00:41:26,565
He's before the Council now.

561
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,241
This time he's attacking Nicodemus openly.

562
00:41:29,276 --> 00:41:30,753
And the Plan, no doubt.

563
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,116
Nothing will come of it. It'll pass.

564
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,273
Beware, boy, he's dangerous.

565
00:41:37,715 --> 00:41:40,223
Jenner will be the undoing of the Rats of NIMH.

566
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,933
I'm sorry to come here at such a bad time.

567
00:41:50,934 --> 00:41:51,788
I suppose...

568
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:54,901
No, sweet lady, you are welcome here.

569
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:58,985
We tend to take ourselves a bit too seriously.

570
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,066
The Plan is nothing but folly!

571
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,406
A doddering old fool's fantasy!

572
00:42:10,407 --> 00:42:14,540
Nicodemus would have us destroy this colony

573
00:42:14,575 --> 00:42:18,811
only to lead us to starvation in some wilderness!

574
00:42:18,888 --> 00:42:20,786
Ahem. Good ol' Jenner.

575
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,972
Wait. Listen.

576
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:26,382
Moving to Thorn Valley is a good plan!

577
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:29,236
Fie! We have everything we need right here!

578
00:42:29,371 --> 00:42:31,612
You mean we steal everything we need.

579
00:42:31,647 --> 00:42:34,175
Well come on, you suspicious old goat!

580
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,219
If we stay here, humans are
bound to discover us.

581
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,395
They'd destroy us on the spot!

582
00:42:39,396 --> 00:42:40,000
I agree!

583
00:42:40,001 --> 00:42:41,618
He's right. We'll be killed.

584
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:44,000
Not if we got them first!

585
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:45,007
He means war!

586
00:42:45,008 --> 00:42:46,928
We'd be outnumbered.

587
00:42:46,963 --> 00:42:48,188
There are too many of them!

588
00:42:48,189 --> 00:42:49,194
Hear me!

589
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:53,956
The Thorn Valley Plan is the aspiration
of idiots and dreamers!

590
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:54,552
We....

591
00:42:56,427 --> 00:42:58,736
We were just talking about you.

592
00:42:58,771 --> 00:43:00,342
That's refreshing, Jenner

593
00:43:00,343 --> 00:43:02,213
Usually you're screaming about us.

594
00:43:02,324 --> 00:43:03,805
Who is that?

595
00:43:03,806 --> 00:43:05,288
You know the rules

596
00:43:05,323 --> 00:43:07,141
there are no visitors allowed here.

597
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:11,388
May I present Mrs. Jonathan Brisby.

598
00:43:12,863 --> 00:43:14,535
Jonathan Brisby is dead!

599
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:15,962
She's not one of us.

600
00:43:15,997 --> 00:43:17,553
What's the meaning of this?

601
00:43:17,588 --> 00:43:18,792
Send her away.

602
00:43:18,827 --> 00:43:20,402
Let's get back to business!

603
00:43:20,403 --> 00:43:21,115
Wait, wait!

604
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:24,755
She has been to see the Great Owl!

605
00:43:26,034 --> 00:43:30,110
He has told her that we could move
the Brisby home to safety.

606
00:43:31,024 --> 00:43:33,565
Her home was Jonathan's home.

607
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,301
We have urgent problems of our own.

608
00:43:35,336 --> 00:43:37,872
Let the lower creatures fend for themselves!

609
00:43:40,176 --> 00:43:41,500
Order, order!

610
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:45,476
Wait, my friend. I smell an opportunity.

611
00:43:45,511 --> 00:43:46,270
What?

612
00:43:46,271 --> 00:43:48,874
Manoeuvers of this nature are dangerous.

613
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:51,718
Accidents could happen...

614
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:52,727
Accidents?

615
00:43:52,728 --> 00:43:53,107
Jenner?

616
00:43:53,108 --> 00:43:54,692
I'll explain later.

617
00:43:54,727 --> 00:43:57,918
Mrs. Brisby! A thousand pardons, my dear!

618
00:43:57,953 --> 00:44:00,830
Forgive the ill temper of my colleague.

619
00:44:00,865 --> 00:44:05,744
It would be an honor to assist
Jonathan's widow in any way.

620
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:09,307
We are but your humble servants.

621
00:44:09,585 --> 00:44:10,471
Th..thank-you.

622
00:44:10,506 --> 00:44:12,315
I second the motion.

623
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:12,959
Hear hear!

624
00:44:12,994 --> 00:44:14,719
Motion has been moved and seconded.

625
00:44:14,754 --> 00:44:17,028
Those in favor make a show of hands.

626
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:18,932
He's up to something....

627
00:44:18,967 --> 00:44:21,508
Take Mrs. Brisby to the library.

628
00:44:21,543 --> 00:44:24,617
-We'll approach Nicodemus when the meeting's over.
-Motion carried.

629
00:44:32,076 --> 00:44:33,673
Ok now, wait a minute

630
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:34,896
this isn't what you think.

631
00:44:35,663 --> 00:44:37,809
You don't understand
what I'm doing here!

632
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:41,628
Think you can come snooping
about looting and pilfering,

633
00:44:41,663 --> 00:44:43,664
just when everyone's away?

634
00:44:43,665 --> 00:44:45,790
Well uh...Let me explain about...

635
00:44:45,825 --> 00:44:48,149
Oh! What a lovely hat you're wearing!

636
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:50,193
Don't you sweettalk me!

637
00:44:50,228 --> 00:44:53,635
I know you're in league with those awful rats!

638
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,654
Rats? Ummm...what rats?

639
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:58,301
Hoodlums, the lot of you!

640
00:44:58,336 --> 00:45:00,110
Ummmm...why did you say rats?

641
00:45:00,145 --> 00:45:03,208
You think the world owes you a living, right?

642
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:03,869
Right.

643
00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:04,806
Wrong!

644
00:45:04,841 --> 00:45:05,828
Wrong! Ohhhh..

645
00:45:06,549 --> 00:45:10,151
look, nice lady, you're making a mistake!

646
00:45:10,186 --> 00:45:14,123
The sooner you delinquents learn that
you must earn your own way....

647
00:45:14,193 --> 00:45:15,788
Wait! Wait, can't we uh...

648
00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:18,337
Can't we talk this over?

649
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,596
...the sooner, the better.

650
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:23,848
You can't leave me like this! There's a ca...ca...

651
00:45:23,883 --> 00:45:25,528
There's a ca...He's a very big...

652
00:45:25,563 --> 00:45:27,606
and he might..and he might...mlfffp!

653
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,977
Good! Good riddance!

654
00:45:31,012 --> 00:45:33,350
Teresa! Martin!

655
00:45:33,385 --> 00:45:36,806
That's the least you deserve.

656
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:37,648
Auntie?

657
00:45:37,683 --> 00:45:39,186
There you are!

658
00:45:40,399 --> 00:45:42,496
Keep an eye on this hooligan.

659
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:46,430
Make sure he doesn't get away
until I can fetch help.

660
00:45:47,105 --> 00:45:50,097
And as for you, you black buzzard.

661
00:45:50,132 --> 00:45:52,781
I wouldn't try anything!

662
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:56,478
I shall return!

663
00:45:59,997 --> 00:46:02,249
Well, I guess we'd better untie him.

664
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,259
But Martin...

665
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,752
Hey, Mom helped a crow in the field
the day before yesterday...

666
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:10,318
He's trying to talk!

667
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:11,983
He looks like a loony.

668
00:46:12,977 --> 00:46:15,782
...He even took her to see
the...the Great Owl!

669
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:16,344
So?

670
00:46:16,345 --> 00:46:18,188
This could be the same crow!

671
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,875
That's me all...Whew! I am the crow.

672
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:26,600
Untie me quick, I can't stand it!

673
00:46:26,635 --> 00:46:28,598
What are you doing here?

674
00:46:28,633 --> 00:46:30,059
Oh, it's a good question, but don't ask.

675
00:46:30,094 --> 00:46:32,709
The legs...the legs...THE LEGS!

676
00:46:33,381 --> 00:46:36,241
Aw, the poor turkey fell down.

677
00:46:36,486 --> 00:46:39,515
I'm not a turkey! Your mother...

678
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:41,239
Where's our mother!

679
00:46:41,274 --> 00:46:43,650
You big buzzard, where's our mother?

680
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:44,950
-What have you done with her?
-You'd better tell me

681
00:46:44,978 --> 00:46:47,000
or I'll tie you back up again!

682
00:46:47,001 --> 00:46:49,130
The...the rosebush! To...to see the rats!

683
00:46:49,165 --> 00:46:50,788
Did you take our mother to the rats?

684
00:46:50,823 --> 00:46:51,906
Well I'm going to go look for her.

685
00:46:51,941 --> 00:46:53,696
No, no, listen, hold it, waitaminute.

686
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:55,592
The rats, they're friendly!

687
00:46:55,627 --> 00:46:57,236
Good! Tonight...Stay!

688
00:46:57,271 --> 00:47:01,907
They're coming here to move
your house where it's safe!

689
00:47:01,942 --> 00:47:02,991
Understand?

690
00:47:03,026 --> 00:47:03,903
Sta-a-ay....

691
00:47:03,938 --> 00:47:06,339
The Owl said they're good and smart.

692
00:47:06,374 --> 00:47:07,465
Get it?

693
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,907
You're right. He's a loony.

694
00:47:10,942 --> 00:47:12,793
Oh no..no, don't...

695
00:47:13,026 --> 00:47:13,626
You must...

696
00:47:13,627 --> 00:47:15,459
No, don't do this!...

697
00:47:22,211 --> 00:47:23,845
Now don't tire him out.

698
00:47:23,846 --> 00:47:24,714
No.

699
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,943
Be brief.

700
00:47:25,978 --> 00:47:27,015
Yes.

701
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,953
Say what you want...and leave.

702
00:47:28,988 --> 00:47:30,068
I won't be a bother.

703
00:47:31,578 --> 00:47:34,358
Justin bothers him enough
with all his silly nonsense.

704
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,510
Here we are.

705
00:47:36,511 --> 00:47:38,112
Thank you, Mr. Ages.

706
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,706
I don't know what Nicodemus sees in that boy...

707
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:42,341
I'll come back for you.

708
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,973
Brief!

709
00:47:48,008 --> 00:47:49,047
Brief.

710
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:26,403
Come closer, my child.

711
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,130
Don't be frightened.

712
00:48:30,772 --> 00:48:31,698
Sir...

713
00:48:33,382 --> 00:48:36,955
the Great Owl sent me to you.

714
00:48:37,053 --> 00:48:39,206
Oh, did he?

715
00:48:41,307 --> 00:48:43,815
He is a dear comrade...

716
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,243
Closer.

717
00:48:48,919 --> 00:48:52,739
Ahhh, Mrs. Jonathan Brisby.

718
00:48:53,789 --> 00:48:55,753
What an honor this is.

719
00:48:55,754 --> 00:48:56,754
How...

720
00:48:56,755 --> 00:49:00,878
how is it that everyone knows Jonathan?

721
00:49:00,879 --> 00:49:04,253
He was a great friend to the Rats of NIMH.

722
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:08,213
He himself came from NIMH.

723
00:49:08,214 --> 00:49:10,743
Your majesty, my family is...

724
00:49:10,744 --> 00:49:13,072
I know of your needs.

725
00:49:14,472 --> 00:49:18,859
There is a book there. Read the words.

726
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,554
I can read, a little.

727
00:49:21,252 --> 00:49:22,476
Jonathan taught me.

728
00:49:23,888 --> 00:49:25,091
The children are better....

729
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,000
than I am...

730
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,212
Read

731
00:49:36,295 --> 00:49:50,910
Jonathan...Brisby...made...possible...the rats
escape...from the t...terrible cruelty of NIMH

732
00:49:51,311 --> 00:49:52,445
Jonathan?

733
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:55,013
He was ki..

734
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,296
killed today....

735
00:50:01,278 --> 00:50:06,169
while drugging the farmer's cat, Dragon.

736
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,712
Oh, I....I never knew...
just what happened.

737
00:50:17,221 --> 00:50:21,226
Why did he never tell me about any of you?

738
00:50:22,209 --> 00:50:22,926
Why?

739
00:50:22,927 --> 00:50:27,000
To answer that, I must tell you about NIMH

740
00:50:27,001 --> 00:50:28,706
and our Plan.

741
00:50:30,835 --> 00:50:31,449
Go!

742
00:50:32,886 --> 00:50:34,029
Look there!

743
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,840
In the beginning, we were ordinary street rats.

744
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:08,723
stealing our daily bread and
living off the efforts of man's work.

745
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:15,727
We were captured, put in cages

746
00:51:15,762 --> 00:51:17,932
and sent to a place called NIMH.

747
00:51:19,073 --> 00:51:23,339
There were many animals
there...in cages

748
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:28,101
They were put through the most unspeakable tortures

749
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:32,916
to satisfy some scientific curiosity.

750
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:39,054
Often at night I would hear
them crying out in anguish

751
00:51:41,608 --> 00:51:45,788
Twenty rats and eleven mice were given injections.

752
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,622
our world began changing...

753
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,922
Then

754
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,321
one night

755
00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:28,827
I looked upon the words under the cage door...

756
00:52:30,288 --> 00:52:32,345
and understood them.

757
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,856
We had become intelligent.

758
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,210
We could read.

759
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,493
The miracle was kept secret from the scientists.

760
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:54,485
and in the quiet of the night

761
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,906
we escaped through the ventilation system.

762
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,876
The mice were blown away

763
00:53:09,564 --> 00:53:13,086
sucked down dark air-shafts to their deaths.

764
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,993
All except two...

765
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,199
Jonathan and Mr. Ages.

766
00:53:23,006 --> 00:53:26,041
We were trapped by a locked door on the roof.

767
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:32,117
It was Jonathan who made
possible the unlocking of the door.

768
00:53:39,598 --> 00:53:42,536
I have a gift. Come.

769
00:53:43,501 --> 00:53:45,319
Jonathan meant it for you.

770
00:53:50,178 --> 00:53:52,062
It's so beautiful!

771
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:53,538
It sleeps.

772
00:53:53,573 --> 00:53:55,130
Sleeps?

773
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:56,348
Yes.

774
00:53:57,454 --> 00:53:59,982
When worn by one with a courageous heart

775
00:54:00,134 --> 00:54:03,223
the Stone glows red.

776
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,286
It becomes a blinding radiance.

777
00:54:07,916 --> 00:54:10,865
Courage of the heart is very rare.

778
00:54:11,826 --> 00:54:15,903
The Stone has a power when it's there.

779
00:54:17,008 --> 00:54:19,404
Look! An inscription.

780
00:54:21,376 --> 00:54:25,126
You can...unlock any door...

781
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:28,139
if you only have the key.

782
00:54:30,442 --> 00:54:31,663
Oh, thank you.

783
00:54:32,395 --> 00:54:35,021
I will treasure it always.

784
00:54:36,012 --> 00:54:38,723
Jonathan couldn't tell you about NIMH

785
00:54:38,758 --> 00:54:43,033
because the injections slowed the aging process.

786
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:49,780
You see, you would have grown old
while he remained young.

787
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:51,296
Nicodemus

788
00:54:52,654 --> 00:54:54,102
The boats are ready and waiting.

789
00:54:55,279 --> 00:54:56,305
We can leave any time.

790
00:54:56,368 --> 00:54:57,434
Good.

791
00:54:58,718 --> 00:55:02,996
My child, shall we journey to your home?

792
00:55:03,031 --> 00:55:03,992
Sir?

793
00:55:04,027 --> 00:55:10,313
Tonight we must move your house
to the protected side of the stone.

794
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,520
The lee of the stone!

795
00:55:12,555 --> 00:55:13,672
Yes.

796
00:55:20,171 --> 00:55:22,210
I don't get it, Jenner.

797
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:25,801
With Nicodemus out of the way

798
00:55:25,836 --> 00:55:29,170
what's to stop us from taking over?

799
00:55:29,205 --> 00:55:31,511
Jenner, you can't kill Nicodemus!

800
00:55:31,546 --> 00:55:33,577
No taste for blood, eh?

801
00:55:33,612 --> 00:55:36,687
They've taken the animal out of you.

802
00:55:36,722 --> 00:55:38,529
What if we're discovered?

803
00:55:38,564 --> 00:55:39,822
Ach, listen.

804
00:55:39,857 --> 00:55:43,421
The Brisby house is a large cement block.

805
00:55:43,456 --> 00:55:46,739
In the moving, what if it should fall?

806
00:55:46,774 --> 00:55:48,332
An accident?

807
00:55:48,367 --> 00:55:49,448
Of course!

808
00:55:49,483 --> 00:55:55,348
Cut the lines, and the weight of it
will crush his bones!

809
00:55:55,693 --> 00:55:56,750
It's risky..

810
00:55:56,785 --> 00:56:00,230
Once rid of Nicodemus, the Plan will die.

811
00:56:00,265 --> 00:56:03,822
We can stay here as long as we like!

812
00:56:03,857 --> 00:56:05,796
What...what about Justin?

813
00:56:05,831 --> 00:56:08,003
Leave him to me...

814
00:56:16,695 --> 00:56:20,963
Sometimes, when we have a large project
that takes us into the open

815
00:56:21,348 --> 00:56:24,329
Mr. Ages makes up a sleeping powder to give to Dragon.

816
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:26,004
How do you get him to take it?

817
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:30,090
Someone must go into the farmhouse kitchen

818
00:56:31,085 --> 00:56:32,473
and put it in his dish.

819
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,457
The only way into the kitchen

820
00:56:36,154 --> 00:56:38,365
is through a tiny hole in the floor.

821
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,774
Ages tried it yesterday.

822
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,446
That's how he broke...

823
00:56:42,481 --> 00:56:43,850
Broke his leg.

824
00:56:44,764 --> 00:56:45,604
Right.

825
00:56:51,306 --> 00:56:52,207
That was close.

826
00:56:53,189 --> 00:56:53,847
What's up there?

827
00:56:53,882 --> 00:56:56,449
The mill. It's falling apart.

828
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:58,612
Hope it stays up there

829
00:56:59,196 --> 00:57:00,915
at least until we've done with the Plan.

830
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:04,327
Plan...what is the Plan?

831
00:57:06,235 --> 00:57:08,913
To live without stealing, of course.

832
00:57:08,948 --> 00:57:11,581
It's wrong to take electricity from the farmer.

833
00:57:12,249 --> 00:57:16,988
My child, we can no longer live as rats.

834
00:57:18,298 --> 00:57:20,063
We know too much.

835
00:57:21,203 --> 00:57:21,900
We're almost there.

836
00:57:22,243 --> 00:57:25,121
Um...your Majesty

837
00:57:25,159 --> 00:57:27,767
I should go prepare the children, for tonight.

838
00:57:29,509 --> 00:57:32,168
We shall wait here until dark...

839
00:57:32,937 --> 00:57:35,635
Um....About Dragon, maybe...

840
00:57:38,332 --> 00:57:40,281
Oh nothing. Goodbye!

841
00:57:53,196 --> 00:57:56,817
I volunteer! For Dragon.

842
00:57:57,188 --> 00:57:58,783
Oh no, Mrs. Brisby!

843
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:00,992
Nicodemus, this is no job for her!

844
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,213
Please.

845
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,061
As you wish.

846
00:58:04,809 --> 00:58:06,144
All right.

847
00:58:07,393 --> 00:58:10,642
I'll meet you at the west
side of the farmhouse at dusk.

848
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,586
Thank you.

849
00:58:12,588 --> 00:58:13,902
Oh I must be crazy.

850
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:17,095
Goodbye!

851
00:58:17,096 --> 00:58:18,353
I must be crazy...

852
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:38,272
Excuse me...pardon me.

853
00:58:38,273 --> 00:58:39,367
Jeremy?

854
00:58:39,361 --> 00:58:41,433
Shhh! I'm being followed

855
00:58:42,087 --> 00:58:42,981
Followed?

856
00:58:43,006 --> 00:58:45,636
Shhh-hhh! There's a crazy lady with a hat!

857
00:58:45,637 --> 00:58:46,611
She's got big teeth!

858
00:58:46,638 --> 00:58:48,585
She tied me up! And then I...oh!

859
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,020
Ooooo! A sparkly!

860
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,718
What?

861
00:58:53,753 --> 00:58:56,816
You're wearing a sparkly!

862
00:58:56,851 --> 00:58:59,000
Can I hold? Oh, please, can I?

863
00:58:59,001 --> 00:59:00,028
Jeremy, listen...

864
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,870
...I need lots and lots of string.

865
00:59:02,905 --> 00:59:04,015
Stuh...ring...

866
00:59:04,016 --> 00:59:05,316
To move the block!

867
00:59:05,351 --> 00:59:07,549
Move....the block...

868
00:59:07,584 --> 00:59:10,239
Hey! I got string! I've been saving 'em!

869
00:59:10,364 --> 00:59:10,789
You do?

870
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:12,080
Oh sure, red ones, blue ones

871
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,586
-green, yellow
-Pay attention!

872
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:15,226
Go get all the string you can.

873
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:16,617
Ok.

874
00:59:18,545 --> 00:59:19,700
But that'll take all day!

875
00:59:19,701 --> 00:59:21,797
Good! Get going!

876
00:59:26,147 --> 00:59:29,424
I just thought I'd mention in passing....

877
00:59:29,459 --> 00:59:33,684
I've always wanted a sparkly of my very own.

878
00:59:33,685 --> 00:59:34,700
Will you get going?

879
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:35,444
Sure!

880
00:59:35,479 --> 00:59:36,620
Uh...Excuse me. Pardon me.

881
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:37,568
Bye!

882
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:47,000
It won't be long now.

883
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:48,339
She's washing the dishes.

884
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,188
Here's the powder.

885
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:52,789
Very.

886
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:53,630
Don't be.

887
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:54,663
You'll be ok.

888
00:59:54,664 --> 00:59:56,750
I hope I haven't upset your plans.

889
00:59:56,751 --> 00:59:58,045
Nonsense!

890
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,360
What makes you say that?

891
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:01,738
I thought I might have caused an argument.

892
01:00:01,773 --> 01:00:02,715
Oh you mean Jenner.

893
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:03,856
No problem.

894
01:00:04,622 --> 01:00:05,600
Justin?

895
01:00:06,479 --> 01:00:09,312
I sincerly hope you make it to Thorn Valley.

896
01:00:09,313 --> 01:00:10,385
We will.

897
01:00:10,386 --> 01:00:12,134
Shh! Listen.

898
01:00:14,521 --> 01:00:16,756
Mrs. Fitzgibbons is filling Dragon's bowl.

899
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Get ready.

900
01:00:19,001 --> 01:00:20,006
Oh my...

901
01:00:21,565 --> 01:00:22,748
Better leave that cape.

902
01:00:22,783 --> 01:00:24,471
Could get caught on something.

903
01:00:27,473 --> 01:00:28,539
Here's the powder.

904
01:00:31,792 --> 01:00:32,999
I don't think I can do this!

905
01:00:33,001 --> 01:00:33,999
Yes you can!

906
01:00:35,143 --> 01:00:36,645
Now take a deep breath.

907
01:00:38,008 --> 01:00:39,159
Concentrate on the bowl.

908
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,150
Don't look at the door!

909
01:00:41,402 --> 01:00:42,409
Steady...

910
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,565
Ok Dragon, I'm coming.

911
01:00:47,112 --> 01:00:48,168
steady....

912
01:00:48,594 --> 01:00:49,770
There we go.

913
01:00:50,523 --> 01:00:52,858
Now! Now!

914
01:00:58,172 --> 01:00:59,831
Coming, coming!

915
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,999
Get back!

916
01:01:05,169 --> 01:01:07,000
Mom! Don't let the cat in yet

917
01:01:07,001 --> 01:01:08,136
I've caught a mouse!

918
01:01:08,136 --> 01:01:09,173
A mouse?

919
01:01:09,174 --> 01:01:10,861
Can I keep it? Can I?

920
01:01:10,896 --> 01:01:13,900
No, Billy. Put it outside.

921
01:01:13,901 --> 01:01:14,998
Damn!

922
01:01:14,999 --> 01:01:16,393
Aw Mom, please?

923
01:01:16,428 --> 01:01:18,555
I can keep it in Porgy's old cage.

924
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:20,666
Oh...all right.

925
01:01:20,701 --> 01:01:22,000
Come on, Dragon.

926
01:01:22,001 --> 01:01:23,758
I'll have to come back for you later.

927
01:01:27,051 --> 01:01:29,400
Rats, rats?

928
01:01:29,401 --> 01:01:31,187
They'll be here any minute...

929
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,287
...to move our house over there by the stone!

930
01:01:33,288 --> 01:01:34,666
Wrong!

931
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:36,276
...Actually move it!

932
01:01:36,311 --> 01:01:38,745
Not while I'm keeping watch!

933
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,554
Auntie Shrew? I'm not afraid.

934
01:01:41,589 --> 01:01:42,905
Afraid, child?

935
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:46,485
I have no fear of those great hulking beasts.

936
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:51,594
And should one of those hairy
barbarians come through that door...

937
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,593
Oh! The rats!

938
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,901
I'm coming, I'm coming, hold your horses.

939
01:02:10,815 --> 01:02:11,895
Hello?

940
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:13,439
Who?

941
01:02:14,623 --> 01:02:15,682
NIMH.

942
01:02:15,717 --> 01:02:17,523
Oh! Oh yeah, NIMH!

943
01:02:17,558 --> 01:02:20,475
Yes, yes, I know, you called about the rats.....

944
01:02:21,284 --> 01:02:23,800
Well, I don't know nothing about any special behavior

945
01:02:23,801 --> 01:02:26,851
but the traps sure don't work....

946
01:02:27,491 --> 01:02:28,400
In the morning?

947
01:02:29,524 --> 01:02:30,705
Suits me fine...

948
01:02:31,267 --> 01:02:34,404
Oh no, no, you can bulldoze that rosebush right outta there

949
01:02:34,405 --> 01:02:36,220
I want those rats exterminated!

950
01:02:36,221 --> 01:02:38,870
Uh, well, there's no...charge....?

951
01:02:39,805 --> 01:02:40,892
Good. Ok,

952
01:02:40,893 --> 01:02:43,000
well, I'll see you tomorrow then...

953
01:02:43,001 --> 01:02:44,866
Uh-huh... bye-bye.

954
01:02:45,101 --> 01:02:47,975
NIMH...They're coming here?

955
01:02:48,286 --> 01:02:49,873
I must warn Justin!

956
01:03:18,189 --> 01:03:19,465
Teresa!

957
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,162
Martin!

958
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,670
Auntie's afraid!

959
01:03:29,141 --> 01:03:30,529
Pull on the end-haul.

960
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:33,660
Careful. Careful!

961
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:35,703
Easy does it...

962
01:03:35,704 --> 01:03:38,254
Nicodemus is cooperating beautifully...

963
01:03:38,255 --> 01:03:39,010
Jenner...

964
01:03:39,256 --> 01:03:41,792
...he's standing in just the right spot!

965
01:03:43,188 --> 01:03:44,910
Jenner, I...I can't do it!

966
01:03:44,911 --> 01:03:47,317
When that block reaches midway, you cut the line.

967
01:03:47,318 --> 01:03:48,389
I...

968
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:52,159
Don't get any ideas, my friend.

969
01:03:52,194 --> 01:03:55,007
You're in this up to your neck!

970
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:56,552
Come on mates!

971
01:03:57,093 --> 01:03:58,803
Put your backs into it!

972
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,800
Ready with the knife...

973
01:04:41,939 --> 01:04:42,947
Ready....

974
01:04:45,728 --> 01:04:46,800
Cut now!

975
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,261
-I...I...
-Now! Cut it!

976
01:04:49,262 --> 01:04:50,262
Don't!

977
01:05:08,999 --> 01:05:10,000
Ok, help.

978
01:05:10,001 --> 01:05:11,001
We've got to hurry!

979
01:05:11,002 --> 01:05:12,022
That's it.

980
01:05:14,136 --> 01:05:15,126
Come on, come on!

981
01:05:15,127 --> 01:05:16,132
We're coming!

982
01:05:17,859 --> 01:05:21,120
Ok, I see him!

983
01:05:25,822 --> 01:05:27,176
Nicodemus...

984
01:05:28,579 --> 01:05:29,800
oh no!

985
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,068
No!

986
01:06:28,295 --> 01:06:29,296
Friends...

987
01:06:29,603 --> 01:06:32,014
we cannot move the Brisby home.

988
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:34,770
But we...we just can't leave it here

989
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:36,800
in the mud.

990
01:06:36,901 --> 01:06:38,901
The equipment is a shambles.

991
01:06:39,102 --> 01:06:40,152
Justin!

992
01:06:40,336 --> 01:06:44,972
One day we shall journey to
Thorn Valley just as Nicodemus wanted...

993
01:06:45,307 --> 01:06:46,682
but not now.

994
01:06:46,683 --> 01:06:47,683
Justin!

995
01:06:48,085 --> 01:06:49,807
Mrs....Brisby?

996
01:06:50,042 --> 01:06:53,199
Come. Let us return to the rosebush.

997
01:06:53,777 --> 01:06:55,009
Where we belong.

998
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,158
Oh, Mr. Ages!

999
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:00,404
What happened?

1000
01:07:00,727 --> 01:07:01,747
The children!

1001
01:07:01,782 --> 01:07:03,555
They...they're fine.

1002
01:07:05,664 --> 01:07:09,325
Nicodemus is...dead.

1003
01:07:09,326 --> 01:07:12,138
Oh...oh, no.

1004
01:07:17,007 --> 01:07:18,322
You're in great danger.

1005
01:07:18,357 --> 01:07:19,764
NIMH is coming!

1006
01:07:19,799 --> 01:07:21,615
Come come, let's return to the rosebush...

1007
01:07:21,616 --> 01:07:22,600
NIMH is coming!

1008
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:23,800
-NIMH?
-In the morning!

1009
01:07:23,801 --> 01:07:24,950
-NIMH!
-Yes.

1010
01:07:24,951 --> 01:07:27,311
You will all die unless you leave the farm tonight.

1011
01:07:27,312 --> 01:07:28,315
Lies!

1012
01:07:28,316 --> 01:07:30,245
Please! You must believe me!

1013
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,300
What if it's true?

1014
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:32,588
-We'll all be killed!
-Don't panic!

1015
01:07:32,589 --> 01:07:34,402
Don't listen! She's hysterical!

1016
01:07:34,403 --> 01:07:35,501
Get out now...

1017
01:07:36,284 --> 01:07:37,800
You get out! I've had enough!

1018
01:07:37,801 --> 01:07:38,771
Jenner!

1019
01:07:39,106 --> 01:07:40,474
Justin! Justin!

1020
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:47,300
Jenner, stop this!

1021
01:07:50,003 --> 01:07:51,095
The Stone....

1022
01:07:51,224 --> 01:07:51,987
Jenner...

1023
01:07:51,988 --> 01:07:53,147
Get out of my way!

1024
01:07:58,186 --> 01:07:59,857
I want that Stone!

1025
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:03,613
Jenner!

1026
01:08:07,657 --> 01:08:09,485
Justin, Justin!

1027
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:10,318
my sword!

1028
01:08:32,887 --> 01:08:33,895
It was you...

1029
01:08:36,184 --> 01:08:37,379
You did it!

1030
01:08:37,634 --> 01:08:38,816
You killed Nicodemus.

1031
01:08:39,652 --> 01:08:41,054
That was no accident!

1032
01:08:41,519 --> 01:08:43,161
Yes. I killed him!

1033
01:09:01,674 --> 01:09:03,465
He wanted to destroy everything!

1034
01:09:05,612 --> 01:09:07,112
I've learned this much

1035
01:09:07,113 --> 01:09:11,060
Take what you can, when you can!

1036
01:09:11,122 --> 01:09:13,444
Then you've learned nothing!

1037
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:31,200
Friends...

1038
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,620
tonight we journey to Thorn Valley.

1039
01:09:37,185 --> 01:09:38,676
We will leave no tracks.

1040
01:09:41,639 --> 01:09:44,711
No evidence that the Rats of NIMH ever existed...

1041
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,951
Come.

1042
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,788
Hello, is anybody up there?

1043
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,234
-Martin?
-Momma!

1044
01:10:27,469 --> 01:10:29,800
Mother, are we almost moved?

1045
01:10:30,235 --> 01:10:31,268
Soon now...

1046
01:10:43,585 --> 01:10:44,353
It's sinking...

1047
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:45,975
it's sinking...

1048
01:10:48,121 --> 01:10:51,000
Justin, the block! It's sinking!

1049
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:51,999
What?

1050
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,400
Come on!

1051
01:10:55,401 --> 01:10:56,729
Oh no, it's sinking!

1052
01:10:56,730 --> 01:10:59,874
There must be a...a cave in below!

1053
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,550
Here, tie these lines together.

1054
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,076
I'll get a line around the stone.

1055
01:11:03,077 --> 01:11:04,200
now!

1056
01:11:04,201 --> 01:11:05,230
Brutus, quick, get some rope.

1057
01:11:05,231 --> 01:11:06,511
Tie off those blocklines.

1058
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:07,892
Hurry it up, come on!

1059
01:11:08,174 --> 01:11:09,242
Move it!

1060
01:11:10,364 --> 01:11:12,073
Mother! Mother!

1061
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,479
What's all that black stuff?

1062
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,214
Come on, Teresa, get up on the table!

1063
01:11:17,215 --> 01:11:18,264
Cynthia...!

1064
01:11:18,299 --> 01:11:19,598
What about Timmy?

1065
01:11:19,633 --> 01:11:21,200
Get us out of here!

1066
01:11:21,535 --> 01:11:22,661
Mother!

1067
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,749
Another line! Get some rope!

1068
01:11:30,391 --> 01:11:31,284
Justin!

1069
01:11:34,096 --> 01:11:35,099
Justin!

1070
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:39,870
Hang on! Don't let go!

1071
01:11:44,582 --> 01:11:45,900
Grab onto my foot!

1072
01:11:45,951 --> 01:11:47,255
I can't breathe!

1073
01:11:59,176 --> 01:12:00,633
Oh no! Come on!

1074
01:12:01,057 --> 01:12:03,007
-It's sinking farther!
-We're losing it!

1075
01:12:34,629 --> 01:12:37,319
Courage of the heart is very rare...

1076
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:42,539
the Stone has a power when it's there.

1077
01:12:42,599 --> 01:12:43,739
The stone...

1078
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Momma, I'm tired of bed. I want to get up!

1079
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,086
Well, you're not getting up.

1080
01:15:15,367 --> 01:15:17,321
Miss Briz! Oh Briz!

1081
01:15:17,556 --> 01:15:18,633
Where are ya?

1082
01:15:18,634 --> 01:15:19,700
Over here!

1083
01:15:21,021 --> 01:15:22,130
Here it is!

1084
01:15:23,075 --> 01:15:24,410
I brought the whole mess!

1085
01:15:24,445 --> 01:15:26,008
There's plenty more where this came from too.

1086
01:15:26,009 --> 01:15:27,412
I got connections!

1087
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:30,708
Hey! Your house is moved!

1088
01:15:30,743 --> 01:15:34,244
Oh no! What am I gonna do with all this string?

1089
01:15:34,579 --> 01:15:36,121
You'll think of something.

1090
01:15:36,701 --> 01:15:39,445
Ah, what's the use?

1091
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,363
What's a guy like me going to
do with a love nest anyway?

1092
01:15:48,783 --> 01:15:50,434
-Excuse me, pardon me
-Excuse me, pardon me

1093
01:15:51,229 --> 01:15:53,785
Look Mommy! Another turkey!

1094
01:15:57,871 --> 01:15:59,689
Stay right there.

1095
01:16:00,098 --> 01:16:01,704
Miss Briz! Miss Briz!

1096
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:04,835
Lemme have the sparkly! I gotta have the sparkly!

1097
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:06,533
Miss B, I gotta have it!

1098
01:16:06,568 --> 01:16:09,200
Girls can't resist a sparkly, oh please! Pleease!

1099
01:16:09,201 --> 01:16:10,480
I gave it to Justin.

1100
01:16:10,481 --> 01:16:12,280
Justin? Who the heck is Justin?

1101
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:13,378
The leader of the rats.

1102
01:16:13,379 --> 01:16:15,995
The leader of the rats!? How could you do this to me?

1103
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:19,464
What'll I say? Mrs. B, what'll I do?

1104
01:16:19,465 --> 01:16:20,467
Well...

1105
01:16:21,056 --> 01:16:24,277
just be, ummm...Be athletic!

1106
01:16:24,278 --> 01:16:26,699
Ah! That's right! Athletic!

1107
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:30,286
I'll just be a little...AAUUGHHH!

1108
01:16:47,981 --> 01:16:50,850
Mother, did the rats really go to Thorn Valley?

1109
01:16:50,851 --> 01:16:51,950
Yes, they did.

1110
01:16:51,951 --> 01:16:53,100
Will we ever see them?

1111
01:16:53,101 --> 01:16:53,998
Perhaps.

1112
01:16:53,999 --> 01:16:54,899
Today!

1113
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:57,826
No...when you're older.

1114
01:16:57,861 --> 01:16:59,275
Brisby!

1115
01:16:59,276 --> 01:17:00,479
Oh! Auntie Shrew!

1116
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:01,934
Oh Auntie!

1117
01:17:01,935 --> 01:17:03,544
Oh no!

1118
01:17:38,464 --> 01:17:42,130
# Dream by night, wish by day #

1119
01:17:42,131 --> 01:17:45,487
# Love begins this way #

1120
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:50,448
# Lovin' starts when open hearts #

1121
01:17:51,408 --> 01:17:53,681
# Touch and stay #

1122
01:17:54,575 --> 01:17:58,209
# Sleep for now, dreamings how #

1123
01:17:58,515 --> 01:18:01,797
# Lovers' lives are planned #

1124
01:18:02,649 --> 01:18:06,729
# Future songs and flying dreams #

1125
01:18:07,164 --> 01:18:10,127
# Hand in hand #

1126
01:18:10,874 --> 01:18:14,563
# Love it seems, made flying dreams #

1127
01:18:14,564 --> 01:18:18,354
# So hearts could soar #

1128
01:18:18,766 --> 01:18:22,413
# Heaven sent these wings were meant #

1129
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:25,990
# To prove once more #

1130
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:30,000
# That love is the key #

1131
01:18:30,878 --> 01:18:34,416
# Love is the key #

1132
01:18:34,951 --> 01:18:38,619
# You and I, touch the sky #

1133
01:18:38,654 --> 01:18:41,952
# The eagle and the dove #

1134
01:18:43,065 --> 01:18:47,061
# Nightingales, we keep our sails #

1135
01:18:47,818 --> 01:18:49,791
# Filled with love #

1136
01:18:50,857 --> 01:18:54,491
# And love it seems, made flying dreams #

1137
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,475
# To bring you home to me. #

1138
01:19:31,495 --> 01:19:34,920
# Love it seems, made flying dreams #

1139
01:19:34,955 --> 01:19:38,297
# So hearts could soar #

1140
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:42,841
# Heaven sent these wings were meant #

1141
01:19:43,373 --> 01:19:46,655
# To prove once more #

1142
01:19:47,322 --> 01:19:50,212
# That love is the key #

1143
01:19:51,327 --> 01:19:54,966
# Love is the key #

1144
01:19:55,807 --> 01:19:59,274
# You and I, touch the sky #

1145
01:19:59,309 --> 01:20:03,236
# The eagle and the dove #

1146
01:20:03,563 --> 01:20:07,576
# Nightingales, we keep our sails #

1147
01:20:08,385 --> 01:20:10,660
# Filled with love #

1148
01:20:11,778 --> 01:20:15,156
# Ever strong, our future song #

1149
01:20:15,547 --> 01:20:18,730
# To sing it must be free #

1150
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,308
# Every part is from the heart #

1151
01:20:23,309 --> 01:20:27,004
# And love is still the key #

1152
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:31,388
# And love it seems, made flying dreams #

1153
01:20:31,598 --> 01:20:37,000
# To bring you home to me #
