1
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,597
It's still on, and we're going.

2
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,400
Cyrus sent an emissary
this afternoon to make sure.

3
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,509
Now, Cyrus don't want
anybody packed.

4
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,236
He don't want anybody
flexing any muscle.

5
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:31,508
I gave him my word that the Warriors
would uphold the truce.

6
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:36,544
Everybody says that Cyrus
is the one and only.

7
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,894
I think we'd better go have
a look for ourself.

8
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,131
- We ain't been to the Bronx before.
- No sweat.

9
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,398
This conclave's gonna be
a real big item.

10
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,974
Every gang in the city
is gonna be there.

11
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,893
We're going in with nothing.

12
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,397
We're going in there
like everybody else.

13
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,535
Nine guys, no weapons.

14
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,909
You got the stuff?

15
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,074
I want you to hit everything in sight.

16
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,806
I want everybody to know
the Warriors were there.

17
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,813
You never know what's out there.

18
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,013
- Wearing our colors, we can't hide.
- Who wants to hide?

19
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,389
Maybe we'll get to waste
a few heads along the way.

20
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,894
You just soldier
and keep your mouth shut.

21
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,870
When we get there,
you stick close by, okay?

22
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,100
Don't worry.
I don't feel like getting wrecked.

23
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,973
One thing we might get out
of Cyrus' little get-together...

24
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,013
...is meeting some strange wool.

25
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,447
I wouldn't mind laying something down
on the way back.

26
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,746
You got a one-track brain,
you know that?

27
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,513
What's the matter?
You going faggot?

28
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,657
What do you know about Cyrus?

29
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,521
Magic.

30
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,554
A whole lot of magic.

31
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:16,067
- What do you know about Cyrus?
- He's the one and only.

32
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,896
When you're president
of the biggest gang in the city,

33
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,629
you don't have to take any shit.

34
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,535
Fuck him.

35
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,487
I'll tell you something,
I'll bet nobody's even gonna be there.

36
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:05,132
Can you count, suckers?!

37
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:11,406
I say the future is ours...

38
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,977
...if you can count!

39
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,388
- Come on, Cyrus, we're with you!
- Go ahead, bro!

40
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,069
Now, look what we have
here before us.

41
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,903
We've got the Saracens...

42
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,405
...sitting next to
the Jones Street Boys.

43
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,778
We've got the Moon Runners...

44
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,211
...right by the Van Courtland Rangers.

45
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:49,019
Nobody is wasting nobody.

46
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,984
That...

47
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,987
...is a miracle.

48
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,923
And miracles

49
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,756
is the way things ought to be.

50
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,694
- Yeah!
- I heard that!

51
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:06,168
- I heard that.
- Come get answered!

52
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:15,472
You're standing right now
with nine delegates from 100 gangs.

53
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,478
And there's over 100 more.

54
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:22,382
That's 20,000 hard-core members.

55
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,914
Forty thousand, counting affiliates,

56
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:31,028
and 20,000 more,
not organized but ready to fight.

57
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,756
Sixty thousand soldiers.

58
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:43,601
Now, there ain't but 20,000 police
in the whole town. Can you dig it?

59
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,902
Can you dig it?

60
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:50,674
- Can you dig it?
- Yeah!

61
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,599
Now here's the sum total.

62
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,769
One gang could run this city.

63
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,365
One gang.

64
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,374
Nothing would move
without us allowing it to happen.

65
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,377
We could tax the crime syndicates,

66
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,979
the police,

67
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,345
because we got the streets, suckers!

68
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,953
Can you dig it?

69
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,532
Right on!

70
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,684
The problem in the past

71
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,412
has been the man turning us
against one another.

72
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,886
We have been unable
to see the truth,

73
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:10,825
because we've been fighting
for 10 square feet of ground,

74
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:16,434
our turf, our little piece of turf.

75
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,830
That's crap, brothers.

76
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,734
The turf is ours by right

77
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,375
because it's our turn.

78
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,246
All we have to do

79
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,075
is keep up the general truce.

80
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,844
We take over one borough at a time.

81
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,556
Secure our territory,

82
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,686
secure our turf

83
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:48,264
because it's all our turf.

84
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,997
The other way, against the crowd!

85
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,830
And keep your ass down!

86
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,938
Down!

87
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,206
Get out of the way.

88
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,321
They'll kill us all. Watch out, man.
Watch his head.

89
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,863
There wasn't supposed to be
no guns!

90
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,731
Come on, move it!

91
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,373
- Is Cleon all right?
- He's up there.

92
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,099
- Are you sure?
- No.

93
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,005
Come on! Move it!

94
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,844
There he is! That's him!

95
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,043
That's the Warrior!

96
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:26,382
- He shot Cyrus!
- Man, you're crazy. I didn't do nothing.

97
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,186
- We saw him!
- Yeah, that's him.

98
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:33,195
He's the one. He's the one!
The Warriors did it!

99
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,368
The Warriors did it!
The Warriors did it!

100
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,900
The Warriors did it!
The Warriors did it!

101
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,609
Kill him!

102
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,476
Down. Everybody down!

103
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,943
- Shit!
- You all right?

104
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,411
Yeah.

105
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,253
Everybody quiet.

106
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,381
Everybody make it?

107
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,324
Just Cleon's missing.

108
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,994
- Fuzz must've got him.
- Did you see him get busted?

109
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,992
I seen him,
then he wasn't there no more.

110
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,391
I was hauling ass.

111
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,498
Why don't you look around,
make sure we're okay.

112
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,133
This is a graveyard.

113
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,232
What are we gonna do now?

114
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,371
We're going back.

115
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,544
You mind telling us how?

116
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,683
Fucking Coney Island must be
50 to 100 miles from here.

117
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,352
- It's the only choice we got.
- Yeah, real simple.

118
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:12,012
Except that every cop in the city
is looking to bust our heads.

119
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,886
- We got something to think about.
- Yeah? What?

120
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,288
The truce.

121
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,723
Is it still on?

122
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,191
If it ain't, we're gonna have to bop
our way back.

123
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,365
Shit, I wish we was packed.

124
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:36,242
If this truce is off, anything could hit us
between here and that train.

125
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,143
If you get separated,

126
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,545
make it to the platform
at Union Square.

127
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,653
- That's where we change trains.
- I only got one question:

128
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,795
Who named you leader?

129
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,790
I got as much right
to take over as you.

130
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,265
It was Cleon's choice.
Swan's war chief.

131
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,770
Right now Cleon's most likely got
a nightstick shoved halfway up his ass.

132
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:07,676
Shit. I bet you can't even
find the subway.

133
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,273
Maybe we ought to talk
about this later, huh?

134
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,644
Well, what's wrong with right now?

135
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,683
I wanna be warlord.

136
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,619
Make your move.

137
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,523
- Hey, Ajax, lighten up.
- Big boy, Swan's war chief.

138
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,157
We better stick together.

139
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,125
Hey, you guys!
The train's right over there.

140
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,235
Come on. Hurry up. Let's go!

141
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,437
Let's move.

142
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,003
Hey, man, don't worry about it.
Stay loose.

143
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,648
Fuck.

144
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,352
Rembrandt, mark this spot.

145
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,636
Hey! Wait for me!

146
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,890
Riffs!

147
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,787
Yeah, right!

148
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,839
Who are the Warriors?

149
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,214
There must be some word.

150
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,418
I want them all.

151
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,465
I want all the Warriors!

152
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:45,262
I want them alive, if possible.
If not, wasted.

153
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,006
But I want them.

154
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,241
Send the word.

155
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,958
All right, now, for all you boppers
out there in the big city,

156
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,924
all you street people
with an ear for the action,

157
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:15,088
I've been asked to relay a request
from the Gramercy Riffs.

158
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,268
It's a special for the Warriors.

159
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,233
That's that real,
live bunch from Coney.

160
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,408
And I do mean the Warriors.

161
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,099
Here's a hit with them in mind.

162
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,016
Be looking good, Warriors.

163
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:51,082
All the way back to Coney.

164
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,120
You hear me, babies?

165
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,590
Good. Real good.

166
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,592
<i>Adis.</i>

167
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:12,465
- Come on. What kind of crap is this?
- Yeah. What are we waiting for?

168
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:13,904
A train would help,

169
00:25:14,111 --> 00:25:17,012
unless you wanna go up there and
get japped on an open platform.

170
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:19,205
Bullshit, man.
There ain't nobody on the street.

171
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:22,112
He's right. We're acting like faggots.

172
00:25:27,391 --> 00:25:29,416
Just keep talking.

173
00:25:44,174 --> 00:25:45,869
Move.

174
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:57,145
That's the Turnbull A.C.'s.

175
00:25:58,355 --> 00:26:00,414
I think they forgot about the truce.

176
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:01,852
No shit.

177
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,388
Those lousy skinheaded fucks.

178
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:25,275
That's our train. We gotta make it.

179
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,945
Oh, Jesus Christ!

180
00:26:40,664 --> 00:26:42,291
Are we gonna go for it?

181
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,310
Hold the fucking train!

182
00:28:20,397 --> 00:28:22,490
Those guys were some
desperate dudes.

183
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,498
- So was we!
- Even fight. We could take them.

184
00:28:26,737 --> 00:28:28,295
Bunch of chickenshits!

185
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:30,700
Those cats didn't look
too chicken shit to me.

186
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:32,341
Me neither.

187
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:38,311
Well, we made it. And in an hour,
it is C.I., the Big Coney.

188
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:40,813
You got it. Give me that fist, buddy.

189
00:28:41,485 --> 00:28:43,680
When we get there,
that's when we've made it.

190
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:49,818
Hey, no sweat, war chief.

191
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:52,859
- Hey! I've got Coney Island!
- Yeah!

192
00:28:53,063 --> 00:28:55,258
Figure out how many stops
to the Union Square?

193
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:58,299
Hey, come on, man.
That's high math for Rembrandt.

194
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:01,562
It's all right. Nobody can read
these maps anyway.

195
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:04,798
Hey, forget it. What's the difference?
We're home free.

196
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,748
We just heard from the Turnbulls.

197
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,747
They blew it.

198
00:29:33,637 --> 00:29:36,037
Shit. This train's had it.

199
00:29:36,406 --> 00:29:37,930
This is fucking impossible.

200
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:40,804
What the shit are we gonna do?
This sucks.

201
00:29:41,011 --> 00:29:42,444
Why couldn't it rain now?

202
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:46,104
Maybe we ought to worry about
who set that goddamn fire.

203
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:48,175
Come on.

204
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,669
Yeah.

205
00:30:17,881 --> 00:30:19,348
How are you?

206
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,745
I was just checking in.

207
00:30:22,452 --> 00:30:24,682
Yeah, it was a real mess up there.

208
00:30:24,888 --> 00:30:26,981
This guy, Cyrus,

209
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:29,625
had an accident.

210
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:32,856
They did?

211
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:35,856
Well, that's okay.

212
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:39,935
These guys, the Warriors...

213
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:42,596
Yeah, they deserve it.

214
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,969
Yeah, we will.

215
00:30:45,642 --> 00:30:47,701
Take care of yourself.

216
00:30:50,747 --> 00:30:54,012
- We set?
- We're set, all right.

217
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:56,550
Somebody should pick their ass up.

218
00:30:56,753 --> 00:30:57,879
The Riffs sent out the word.

219
00:30:58,088 --> 00:31:00,454
They want them alive.
We don't.

220
00:31:00,657 --> 00:31:02,420
The sooner someone grabs them,
the better.

221
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:06,824
You afraid the Warriors will shoot their
mouths off before they get racked?

222
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,327
Yeah. Right. I'm worried.

223
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:11,023
- I just don't want the Riffs on my ass.
- No sweat.

224
00:31:11,235 --> 00:31:14,261
They're looking for the Warriors,
remember?

225
00:31:16,073 --> 00:31:18,769
We can do some looking too.

226
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:21,206
Ought to make you feel better.

227
00:31:23,847 --> 00:31:25,178
Hey.

228
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:28,442
- What about the money you owe?
- For what?!

229
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:51,404
We've had it.

230
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,609
Yeah, I made them.

231
00:31:54,811 --> 00:31:56,142
Two there, one there.

232
00:31:56,346 --> 00:31:57,870
I think they just made us.

233
00:31:59,216 --> 00:32:00,706
You recognize them?

234
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:02,044
Orphans.

235
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:04,516
So far down,
they ain't even on the map.

236
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:06,211
Real low-class.

237
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:09,586
- Numbers?
- Full strength, maybe 30.

238
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:11,418
Thirty's a lot more than eight.

239
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:14,722
Not if they're wimps.
And I'm sick of this running crap.

240
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:20,932
Come on. This way.

241
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,123
Hey.

242
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:54,831
- You know where that cat's headed.
- Yeah. Reinforcements.

243
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:57,768
We're gonna get japed here.
We're gonna get japped.

244
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:06,506
No matter what he says,
nobody lip-off.

245
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:10,153
Nobody get hot.
I'm gonna see what I can do.

246
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:13,050
- When did you turn into a diplomat?
- Yeah.

247
00:33:13,256 --> 00:33:15,656
You ain't exactly
the State Department type.

248
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:17,952
Fox, you come with me.

249
00:33:26,803 --> 00:33:32,002
- You ought to show me your invitation.
- How do you figure?

250
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:36,475
Well, you come armying down here,
invading our territory.

251
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,671
No permits, no parley.

252
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,518
We're not invading.
And I'm parleying right now.

253
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:44,880
We were just at that big meeting
up in the Bronx.

254
00:33:45,088 --> 00:33:46,282
We're going home to Coney.

255
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,926
The train gets messed up by the fire
and dumps us here.

256
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:53,119
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

257
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,197
How could this be a big meeting
if the Orphans wasn't there?

258
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,494
You didn't miss anything. There was a
lot of hassle. A lot of heads got busted.

259
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:03,195
You think the Orphans ain't with it?
You think we ain't well-known?

260
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:06,069
- We didn't say that.
- Well, we got a heavy rep.

261
00:34:06,276 --> 00:34:08,141
You mess with us,
and you'll find that out.

262
00:34:17,654 --> 00:34:19,087
You see that?

263
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:23,316
They write about our raids
in the paper.

264
00:34:23,794 --> 00:34:25,421
Yeah.

265
00:34:26,696 --> 00:34:28,721
That's really heavy.

266
00:34:28,932 --> 00:34:30,559
The Orphans, right?

267
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:33,895
Yeah, our youth worker,
she talks about you guys all the time.

268
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:36,072
We ain't got one.

269
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:41,003
That must be because you guys
are so bad, they're afraid of you.

270
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:54,380
You can make it through our territory,
as long as you're coming in peace.

271
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:09,463
Cut it, Mercy.

272
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:13,599
You know what that is, don't you?

273
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:15,438
Yeah.

274
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:17,844
Trouble.

275
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:26,949
Those vests are real nice.

276
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:29,884
Lighten up, Mercy.
Stop looking for trouble now.

277
00:35:30,093 --> 00:35:33,460
- I should've slapped your mouth
- So who stopped you?

278
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:40,332
Come on. Give me one.

279
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:43,906
Just one.

280
00:35:44,674 --> 00:35:48,838
I just want one vest.
You can get another one, man.

281
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:51,312
No chance.

282
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,715
Are you just gonna let an army walk
through here any time they feel like it?

283
00:36:00,924 --> 00:36:03,950
- How's it gonna look?
- Get lost.

284
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:07,426
You know, pretty soon, every gang
is just gonna boogie right in,

285
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:08,996
soldier right through.

286
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,294
I'll tell you, some man you are.

287
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:22,438
Take your colors off,
you can walk through.

288
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:29,016
- We don't do that.
- It's just our mark. It don't mean war.

289
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:32,484
You go as civilians, okay? Go as
soldiers, I gotta come down on you.

290
00:36:32,689 --> 00:36:34,122
Now take off your colors.

291
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:38,822
You hear me?

292
00:36:44,234 --> 00:36:45,826
Fuck you.

293
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:04,050
We're not gonna hide who we are just
because some whore shakes her ass.

294
00:37:04,254 --> 00:37:06,381
Don't call me no whore.

295
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,682
I ain't no whore!

296
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:11,922
Let's go.

297
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:25,537
We're marching to the next station
through these lame fucks's territory.

298
00:37:25,742 --> 00:37:27,539
Now let's move.

299
00:37:29,212 --> 00:37:31,339
Yeah. That's right, Warriors.

300
00:37:31,548 --> 00:37:33,709
Just keep walking.

301
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:36,579
Real tough mothers, ain't you?

302
00:37:36,786 --> 00:37:39,050
You guys don't show me much.

303
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:43,215
Why don't you dickheads
just walk all the way back home!

304
00:37:47,063 --> 00:37:50,226
- Boy, that chick's got some mouth.
- You two were terrific back there.

305
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:55,097
- You guys let them down, but good.
- His ass gonna be ringing for a month.

306
00:37:55,305 --> 00:37:59,503
- I say we should have wasted them.
- Come on. The station's this way.

307
00:39:18,254 --> 00:39:20,984
Let me go! Let me be.

308
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,295
Okay, what do you got in mind?

309
00:39:34,104 --> 00:39:36,470
Well, maybe I'm looking
for some real action.

310
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:40,235
Hey, what about me?
I got the big one.

311
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:43,473
I'll give it to you, baby.

312
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,648
Let her go.

313
00:39:49,486 --> 00:39:51,750
You gonna jump me?

314
00:39:51,955 --> 00:39:56,153
Maybe we ought to pull a train on you.
You look like you might even like it.

315
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:59,760
- Fuck you!
- Real tough chick.

316
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,105
You see what you get, Warriors?!

317
00:40:16,312 --> 00:40:18,473
You see what you get
when you mess with the Orphans?!

318
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:30,050
We're gonna rain on you, Warriors!

319
00:40:39,469 --> 00:40:41,937
- Holy shit!
- Now!

320
00:40:55,685 --> 00:40:58,848
- Move, move!
- Where is everybody?

321
00:40:59,055 --> 00:41:00,784
Come on!

322
00:41:26,716 --> 00:41:29,514
Hey, wait a minute.
I gotta ask a question.

323
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:32,018
How come we're running?

324
00:41:33,723 --> 00:41:36,624
I told you, they're a bunch of wimps.

325
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:39,158
Union Station, here we come.

326
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:40,727
Hey, what about me?

327
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:48,930
So, what about you?

328
00:42:01,584 --> 00:42:03,711
We got a report from the Bronx.

329
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,445
Some smalltime clique
ran into them.

330
00:42:06,656 --> 00:42:07,987
The Orphans.

331
00:42:08,191 --> 00:42:11,957
- They're not in our network.
- They rumble anyway.

332
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:14,726
They got wasted.

333
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:25,637
Okay, let's get down to it, boppers.

334
00:42:25,842 --> 00:42:27,742
We're gonna have to do
better out there.

335
00:42:27,944 --> 00:42:31,778
Our friends just made it past
one of the minor league teams.

336
00:42:31,981 --> 00:42:33,710
Remember, boppers,

337
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:36,317
be looking good.

338
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:39,819
All that's going on?

339
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:43,583
Right. Great.

340
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,687
Great.

341
00:42:46,296 --> 00:42:48,196
Yeah.

342
00:42:54,337 --> 00:42:55,304
Well?

343
00:42:55,505 --> 00:42:58,599
Some two-bit outfit almost got them,
but bopped their way past.

344
00:42:58,808 --> 00:43:03,370
- We can meet them at 96th Street.
- The platform's crawling with cops.

345
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,708
Cops are trying to rack up
every gang in this town.

346
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:11,410
- Me and you included.
- How come you're so happy?

347
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:14,613
I'm having a good time.

348
00:43:14,824 --> 00:43:17,224
Let's go!

349
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:37,971
How much longer we gotta wait?
We might be here forever.

350
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:40,672
I'm sick of waiting for trains.

351
00:43:40,883 --> 00:43:43,477
Vermin, sit down and shut up.

352
00:43:44,153 --> 00:43:46,485
Okay, okay.

353
00:44:25,962 --> 00:44:27,691
- Let's go!
- Where are we going?

354
00:44:31,968 --> 00:44:33,560
Hey, hold it!

355
00:44:34,337 --> 00:44:36,828
- Right there.
- Come on.

356
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,530
- Hold it.
- Hey.

357
00:44:43,913 --> 00:44:45,210
Take the uptown.

358
00:44:45,415 --> 00:44:47,713
- Make it! Make it!
- Move!

359
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:51,478
- Hey! Move! Move!
- Wait up!

360
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:54,987
- Come back here!
- Hold it!

361
00:45:04,233 --> 00:45:06,292
Let's double back!

362
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,828
- This way!
- No. Come on. Over here.

363
00:45:09,038 --> 00:45:10,699
That way! Go!

364
00:45:12,475 --> 00:45:13,874
- Down the stairs!
- Hurry up.

365
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:21,379
- The street!
- Far enough, already.

366
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,019
This way.

367
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,484
Oh, shit!

368
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:30,751
Run!

369
00:45:31,294 --> 00:45:33,125
Just get out of here!

370
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:34,523
Move!

371
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:39,725
- Goddamn you!
- Let go of me!

372
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,218
Where are they?

373
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:04,021
- Union Square! Union Square!
- What about the others?

374
00:46:04,227 --> 00:46:05,285
We gotta go!

375
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:08,662
Keep after them! Keep on!

376
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:42,590
Maybe we'd better take off.

377
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:44,289
Yeah. Right.

378
00:47:11,227 --> 00:47:14,162
- Did we lose these fucking clowns?
- Look.

379
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:17,261
Holy shit!

380
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,091
Snow, with me!

381
00:48:57,533 --> 00:48:58,727
Hey!

382
00:49:16,852 --> 00:49:18,717
I can't make it.

383
00:49:18,921 --> 00:49:21,719
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

384
00:49:22,124 --> 00:49:24,888
Good. I'm sick of running
from these wimps.

385
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:46,012
I'm gonna shove that bat up your ass
and turn you into a Popsicle.

386
00:49:46,515 --> 00:49:47,675
Come on.

387
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,265
- Fucking-A.
- Hey!

388
00:51:04,093 --> 00:51:05,754
Come on, cowboy.

389
00:51:14,937 --> 00:51:17,599
Shit, I figured they were wimps.

390
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:24,211
The latest sports news
off the street, boppers.

391
00:51:24,413 --> 00:51:28,110
The Baseball Furies dropped the ball,
made an error.

392
00:51:28,317 --> 00:51:32,481
Our friends are on second base
and trying to make it all the way home.

393
00:51:32,688 --> 00:51:36,283
But the inside word is that
the odds are against them.

394
00:51:36,492 --> 00:51:37,982
Stay tuned, boppers.

395
00:51:38,861 --> 00:51:40,988
Stay tuned.

396
00:52:03,919 --> 00:52:07,446
- Where is everybody?
- Looks like we're the first ones here.

397
00:52:07,656 --> 00:52:10,386
We're just gonna
have to sit and wait.

398
00:52:10,593 --> 00:52:12,390
They'll show up.

399
00:52:12,595 --> 00:52:14,995
Looks like something else
showed up.

400
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:17,390
Well, hey, hey, hey.

401
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,899
Now look at what you find here
in the big city.

402
00:52:21,103 --> 00:52:23,594
- Man, you guys. We ain't got time.
- You kidding?

403
00:52:23,806 --> 00:52:26,934
Time's what we got plenty of.

404
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,815
Hi.

405
00:52:55,304 --> 00:52:56,896
Hey.

406
00:53:15,057 --> 00:53:16,547
Hey.

407
00:53:22,464 --> 00:53:24,193
Hey.

408
00:53:26,235 --> 00:53:28,795
I guess she don't know
that parks ain't safe after dark.

409
00:53:29,004 --> 00:53:33,464
- We ain't got time for this right now.
- We've got to get to Union Square.

410
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:37,575
You go ahead if you want.
I'm gonna get a little exercise.

411
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,078
You never were very smart.

412
00:53:41,517 --> 00:53:43,815
I'll tell you something, warlord.

413
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:45,611
I'm smart enough.

414
00:53:45,821 --> 00:53:47,482
And it's there for free.

415
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,817
You two coming?

416
00:53:50,426 --> 00:53:54,522
- Come on, man.
- There's plenty of women back home.

417
00:53:56,298 --> 00:53:58,562
Maybe all of you just going faggot.

418
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:17,579
You feeling all right, lady?

419
00:54:17,786 --> 00:54:19,549
You need a little help or something?

420
00:54:19,755 --> 00:54:23,213
Why don't you sit down.
Keep me company.

421
00:54:26,962 --> 00:54:28,361
Whatever you say, lady.

422
00:54:31,066 --> 00:54:33,364
Look at those muscles.

423
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:37,061
I bet the chicks like
all those muscles.

424
00:54:46,682 --> 00:54:48,206
Hey.

425
00:54:49,918 --> 00:54:52,216
We better go back
and look out for him.

426
00:54:54,823 --> 00:54:56,916
He saved my ass back there.

427
00:54:57,126 --> 00:54:58,787
I owe him.

428
00:54:59,328 --> 00:55:02,388
Okay, I'll go look for the others.

429
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:15,669
You wanna show me how you play
with the chicks?

430
00:55:17,413 --> 00:55:19,108
Yeah.

431
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:23,678
- I'll show you how I play.
- Hey!

432
00:55:23,886 --> 00:55:25,911
Not so rough. Come on.

433
00:55:26,121 --> 00:55:30,524
- We'll get it on.
- You don't get it. I like it rough.

434
00:55:41,804 --> 00:55:45,069
Your nights in the park
are over for a while, honey.

435
00:55:45,274 --> 00:55:47,105
- You're under arrest.
- Hey, lady--

436
00:55:47,309 --> 00:55:49,038
Come on, lady.

437
00:55:49,578 --> 00:55:51,876
Kiss my ass.

438
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:55,283
Come on, lady.

439
00:55:59,288 --> 00:56:03,418
Come on. Quit playing around.
You don't wanna play around with me!

440
00:56:06,695 --> 00:56:08,595
Let me out of this thing!

441
00:56:08,797 --> 00:56:10,355
You hear me?!

442
00:56:15,337 --> 00:56:17,965
Goddamn it! Let me go!

443
00:56:22,244 --> 00:56:24,337
Let me go!

444
00:56:24,546 --> 00:56:28,573
You can't do this to me!
Come on, you lousy bitch!

445
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:56,673
Fucking wimp.

446
00:57:37,453 --> 00:57:39,011
Hey, wait!

447
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:45,121
Still cops all over the place.

448
00:57:47,529 --> 00:57:49,087
Where's the Fox?

449
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:51,129
A cop grabbed him.

450
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:54,967
So how come you hung around?

451
00:57:57,306 --> 00:57:58,705
I don't know.

452
00:58:00,442 --> 00:58:03,775
- Where did you get the coat?
- You ask a lot of questions.

453
00:58:03,979 --> 00:58:05,970
Don't give me that.

454
00:58:08,116 --> 00:58:10,175
I stole it.

455
00:58:10,552 --> 00:58:13,419
Cops are looking for somebody
in a pink top.

456
00:58:14,156 --> 00:58:15,783
Real tough chick.

457
00:58:15,991 --> 00:58:18,459
Right. You said that before.

458
00:58:20,095 --> 00:58:23,428
If you still wanna get to Union Square,
I can show you where to grab the train.

459
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,567
Okay.

460
00:58:26,768 --> 00:58:28,167
Come on.

461
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,930
Hey.

462
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,181
Hey!

463
00:59:35,137 --> 00:59:36,661
- What is that?
- Hold it!

464
00:59:36,872 --> 00:59:38,533
- Freeze!
- Go on.

465
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:40,235
Move it!

466
00:59:40,442 --> 00:59:41,875
- Jesus!
- Come on!

467
00:59:42,077 --> 00:59:43,840
Run!

468
01:00:03,432 --> 01:00:05,457
Is this the place?

469
01:00:06,268 --> 01:00:10,432
Hey, I hate asking the questions,
but where's the dudes?

470
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:12,800
Chicks like you always got
dudes around.

471
01:00:13,008 --> 01:00:15,806
They took the night off.
Went up to the Bronx.

472
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:17,501
Don't worry about them.

473
01:00:17,713 --> 01:00:20,773
They're lame, real cripples.

474
01:00:30,993 --> 01:00:32,517
Come on.

475
01:00:36,131 --> 01:00:38,656
When I got off that subway
and I saw you, I thought:

476
01:00:38,867 --> 01:00:40,562
"Oh, baby, throw it my way."

477
01:00:40,769 --> 01:00:43,067
I mean, it's really great
of you chicks taking us in.

478
01:00:43,271 --> 01:00:47,367
We know about the Warriors.
They're a heavy outfit. We know you.

479
01:00:47,576 --> 01:00:50,704
- How'd you hear about us?
- You know how. Word gets around.

480
01:00:52,347 --> 01:00:56,716
- I guess we are pretty well-known.
- Come on.

481
01:01:27,282 --> 01:01:29,773
You're the first friendly faces
we've seen all night.

482
01:01:29,985 --> 01:01:31,418
That's the way we are.

483
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:34,020
Let's party a little.
Get something going.

484
01:01:34,222 --> 01:01:38,784
- Yeah, sure. Hey, I can dig that.
- Hey, you came to the right guys.

485
01:01:41,329 --> 01:01:42,956
Oh, hurt me, hurt me.

486
01:01:43,165 --> 01:01:46,430
Don't thank us, man. Just relax.

487
01:01:46,635 --> 01:01:48,296
Fall out.

488
01:01:48,503 --> 01:01:50,596
Take your pick.

489
01:01:58,814 --> 01:02:00,975
Thanks. This is a great outfit.

490
01:02:01,183 --> 01:02:04,152
- What clique is this?
- We're the Lizzies.

491
01:02:05,287 --> 01:02:07,016
Lizzies. Hey, great.

492
01:02:07,222 --> 01:02:09,281
Just great. I like that. I like it.

493
01:02:09,758 --> 01:02:11,055
Glad to hear it.

494
01:02:14,796 --> 01:02:17,856
Man, we got to come
to this part of town more often.

495
01:02:18,066 --> 01:02:19,761
Yeah, right.

496
01:02:22,504 --> 01:02:24,938
That's right. Got to.

497
01:02:28,543 --> 01:02:29,567
Thanks a lot.

498
01:02:34,049 --> 01:02:36,574
- Looks like you're the winner.
- Yeah, right.

499
01:02:47,028 --> 01:02:48,859
How much longer are we
gonna hang around here?

500
01:02:49,998 --> 01:02:53,525
- What's your hurry? We just got here.
- We ought to get to Union Square.

501
01:02:53,735 --> 01:02:56,932
- They're gonna be worried about us.
- Yeah, sure. In a minute.

502
01:02:57,439 --> 01:02:58,565
Quit breaking the action.

503
01:03:27,636 --> 01:03:32,335
Can we stop for a minute? I'm sick
of this crap. My legs are getting tired.

504
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:35,567
- Come on. Just keep walking.
- Well, what's your hurry?

505
01:03:35,777 --> 01:03:39,110
Trying to set some kind of
a world record or something?

506
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:46,314
Hey.

507
01:03:51,526 --> 01:03:54,256
- Just walk.
- I'm walking.

508
01:03:54,462 --> 01:03:57,488
Jesus, why don't you give me
a break.

509
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,901
Be a little friendly.
I don't even know your name.

510
01:04:02,103 --> 01:04:04,469
My name's Swan.

511
01:04:04,873 --> 01:04:07,569
What do you care about
names so much for?

512
01:04:07,776 --> 01:04:10,711
I like telling my friends
I been with somebody particular.

513
01:04:10,912 --> 01:04:12,504
You know what I mean?

514
01:04:12,714 --> 01:04:15,774
Why don't you just
tie a mattress to your back.

515
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:19,415
You don't care where it is, do you?

516
01:04:19,621 --> 01:04:23,751
Look, what do you got against me?
You been picking on me all night.

517
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:25,790
You want me to tell you the truth?

518
01:04:25,994 --> 01:04:27,461
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

519
01:04:27,662 --> 01:04:29,823
I don't like the way you live.

520
01:04:30,699 --> 01:04:32,496
- The way I live?
- Yeah.

521
01:04:33,034 --> 01:04:36,299
I keep hoping I'm gonna run into
something a little better.

522
01:04:36,504 --> 01:04:38,904
What kind of crap is this?

523
01:04:39,107 --> 01:04:41,098
Who are you?
You ain't any better than me.

524
01:04:41,309 --> 01:04:43,504
I guess you like the way
everything's going for you.

525
01:04:43,712 --> 01:04:45,304
Well, maybe I do.

526
01:04:45,513 --> 01:04:48,778
Friday nights are pretty good.
Saturday nights are better.

527
01:04:48,984 --> 01:04:52,147
I don't think you can remember
who you get on Friday and Saturday.

528
01:04:52,354 --> 01:04:54,481
I don't think you can remember
what they look like.

529
01:04:54,689 --> 01:04:58,785
Sometimes I can, and sometimes
I can't. Who gives a damn?

530
01:05:01,363 --> 01:05:04,264
I see what's happening next door
and down the block,

531
01:05:04,466 --> 01:05:07,128
belly hanging down, five kids,

532
01:05:07,335 --> 01:05:09,769
cockroaches in the cupboard.

533
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:13,639
I'll tell you what I want.

534
01:05:14,109 --> 01:05:16,577
I want something now.

535
01:05:16,778 --> 01:05:20,214
This is the life I got left.
You know what I mean?

536
01:05:21,516 --> 01:05:23,950
You get it, Warrior?

537
01:05:25,453 --> 01:05:26,943
Get it?

538
01:05:43,939 --> 01:05:45,839
How do you like it?

539
01:06:29,617 --> 01:06:30,982
Come on. What's wrong?

540
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:34,812
Let's just get
to the next station, okay?

541
01:06:35,523 --> 01:06:36,717
No.

542
01:06:36,925 --> 01:06:38,358
Please?

543
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,289
Come on.

544
01:06:40,895 --> 01:06:42,829
Come on.

545
01:06:43,431 --> 01:06:49,063
You're just part of everything that's
happening tonight, and it's all bad.

546
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:54,431
Just go back to wherever it was
you came from.

547
01:07:41,823 --> 01:07:44,155
Hey, little man, you wanna dance?

548
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:24,626
I'll be right with you, babe.

549
01:08:38,646 --> 01:08:42,047
So you're the famous Warriors,
the guys that shot Cyrus.

550
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:44,775
Shit! The chicks are packed.
The chicks are packed!

551
01:08:46,087 --> 01:08:47,179
Shit!

552
01:09:14,616 --> 01:09:16,607
Shit.

553
01:09:30,465 --> 01:09:32,296
She cut me. She cut me.

554
01:09:33,134 --> 01:09:34,863
Look. Look, man.

555
01:09:35,069 --> 01:09:38,470
Now we gotta hold ourselves together.
We got to.

556
01:09:38,673 --> 01:09:42,803
See, man, now if we go to pieces,
somebody out there's gonna get us.

557
01:09:43,011 --> 01:09:44,444
They think we shot Cyrus.

558
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,916
- What are you talking about?
- They think we shot Cyrus.

559
01:09:49,117 --> 01:09:51,244
Every gang in this city
must be looking for us.

560
01:09:51,452 --> 01:09:53,647
Holy shit!

561
01:09:54,355 --> 01:09:56,823
We're not gonna be able
to make it back.

562
01:09:57,025 --> 01:09:58,754
We're gonna make it back.

563
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,985
We came this far.
We'll go the rest of the way.

564
01:10:01,496 --> 01:10:05,830
Let's go to Union Square, okay?
We gotta tell the rest of the guys.

565
01:12:20,635 --> 01:12:22,398
Hey.

566
01:12:23,104 --> 01:12:25,504
Where's the rest of them?

567
01:12:27,508 --> 01:12:29,373
Yeah, right.

568
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:37,813
Where's everybody else?

569
01:12:38,019 --> 01:12:41,819
Cops got Ajax.
We don't know about Swan.

570
01:12:42,023 --> 01:12:45,515
- Oh, Jesus!
- Are you sure about Ajax?

571
01:12:46,027 --> 01:12:47,995
Real sure.

572
01:12:49,097 --> 01:12:50,894
I bet he went out swinging.

573
01:12:51,766 --> 01:12:53,461
We better go look for Swan.

574
01:12:56,604 --> 01:12:59,038
God, I can't believe it.

575
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,038
Yeah. What is this shit?

576
01:13:26,234 --> 01:13:28,532
I need to talk to you.

577
01:13:29,504 --> 01:13:32,302
See that dude over there
with the skates?

578
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:35,637
Over there.

579
01:13:36,411 --> 01:13:39,574
He's after you.
And he's got some guys with him.

580
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:45,078
I know they're on my ass.

581
01:13:49,724 --> 01:13:51,419
But now they know I know it.

582
01:13:53,227 --> 01:13:55,024
Well, what are you gonna do?

583
01:14:30,331 --> 01:14:31,593
Come on.

584
01:14:31,799 --> 01:14:34,233
You sure change your mind fast.

585
01:14:34,936 --> 01:14:38,872
- I was kind of rough on you there.
- Listen, I can take care of myself.

586
01:14:39,073 --> 01:14:41,098
Sure. Come on.

587
01:14:49,617 --> 01:14:51,812
Wait a minute. I can't go in there.

588
01:14:52,019 --> 01:14:54,078
It's a men's room.

589
01:14:54,856 --> 01:14:56,790
Are you kidding?

590
01:16:46,233 --> 01:16:47,495
Get him!

591
01:18:21,662 --> 01:18:22,890
What about our patrols?

592
01:18:24,065 --> 01:18:25,327
So far, nothing.

593
01:18:26,901 --> 01:18:29,131
But we've got somebody here
you ought to talk to.

594
01:18:29,837 --> 01:18:31,998
He says he saw who shot Cyrus.

595
01:18:51,392 --> 01:18:55,158
Big Cyrus,
he was gonna run the whole city.

596
01:18:55,362 --> 01:18:57,796
What crap that was.

597
01:18:57,998 --> 01:19:00,967
Cyrus was right about one thing.

598
01:19:01,168 --> 01:19:03,830
It's all out there.

599
01:19:04,038 --> 01:19:06,632
All we gotta do is just figure out
a way to go steal it.

600
01:19:07,274 --> 01:19:08,536
Sounds great.

601
01:19:08,743 --> 01:19:12,270
All you gotta do is figure out
what's worth stealing.

602
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:39,365
Okay, come on. Let's go.

603
01:19:41,976 --> 01:19:44,638
Come on, let me get some breakfast
or something.

604
01:20:53,247 --> 01:20:55,579
- Let's get off here.
- Yeah.

605
01:22:11,759 --> 01:22:13,624
What's this for?

606
01:22:14,461 --> 01:22:17,430
I just hate seeing anything
go to waste.

607
01:22:27,908 --> 01:22:31,469
This is what we fought all night
to get back to?

608
01:22:33,847 --> 01:22:36,145
Maybe I'll just take off.

609
01:22:37,384 --> 01:22:39,750
Well, you know I like traveling too.

610
01:22:40,888 --> 01:22:42,583
Where have you ever been?

611
01:22:44,191 --> 01:22:46,125
I never been anywhere.

612
01:22:46,327 --> 01:22:48,727
I just know I'd like it.

613
01:22:51,899 --> 01:22:53,992
Come on. Let's go.

614
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,841
Stay right on their ass.

615
01:23:54,261 --> 01:23:58,197
Wait a couple seconds after we move,
then cut out the other way.

616
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:00,993
- Why can't I stay with you?
- Just do what I tell you.

617
01:24:01,201 --> 01:24:03,431
- Okay?
- Come on.

618
01:24:03,637 --> 01:24:06,128
I can take care of myself.

619
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:08,308
I proved that.

620
01:24:09,777 --> 01:24:11,506
Come on.

621
01:25:07,568 --> 01:25:09,593
Warriors.

622
01:25:09,803 --> 01:25:13,364
Come out to play!

623
01:25:14,308 --> 01:25:16,936
Warriors.

624
01:25:17,144 --> 01:25:21,205
Come out to play!

625
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:24,750
Warriors.

626
01:25:24,952 --> 01:25:28,752
Come out to play.

627
01:25:29,556 --> 01:25:31,319
Warriors.

628
01:25:31,525 --> 01:25:35,689
Come out to play.

629
01:25:35,896 --> 01:25:37,727
Warriors.

630
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:39,831
Come out to play!

631
01:25:44,805 --> 01:25:46,363
Everybody packed?

632
01:25:47,808 --> 01:25:49,366
Yeah.

633
01:25:50,544 --> 01:25:54,605
All of you stay behind me.
I'm gonna take them out to the sand.

634
01:25:54,848 --> 01:25:56,816
What about you? You ready?

635
01:26:01,522 --> 01:26:03,319
Let's do it.

636
01:27:10,457 --> 01:27:14,894
When we see the ocean,
we figure we're home, we're safe.

637
01:27:15,596 --> 01:27:17,826
This time, you got it wrong.

638
01:27:21,468 --> 01:27:23,368
Why did you do it?

639
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:25,731
Why did you waste Cyrus?

640
01:27:25,939 --> 01:27:27,770
No reason.

641
01:27:28,842 --> 01:27:32,005
I just like doing things like that.

642
01:27:38,185 --> 01:27:41,245
Let's do it, me and you.

643
01:27:41,455 --> 01:27:43,753
One on one?

644
01:27:43,957 --> 01:27:46,084
You're crazy.

645
01:27:49,129 --> 01:27:51,097
You're dead,

646
01:27:51,298 --> 01:27:53,960
all of you, and you know it.

647
01:27:55,569 --> 01:27:56,866
- You're dead.
- Swan!

648
01:28:25,766 --> 01:28:28,257
- Riffs!
- Yeah, right!

649
01:28:56,730 --> 01:28:58,698
You still looking for us?

650
01:29:01,168 --> 01:29:03,534
We found what we're looking for.

651
01:29:05,172 --> 01:29:07,037
No.

652
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:09,208
No.

653
01:29:09,409 --> 01:29:11,240
It wasn't us.

654
01:29:11,445 --> 01:29:15,040
It was them, the Warriors.

655
01:29:15,849 --> 01:29:17,817
You Warriors are good.

656
01:29:18,985 --> 01:29:20,953
Real good.

657
01:29:22,989 --> 01:29:24,513
The best.

658
01:29:25,892 --> 01:29:27,189
The rest is ours.

659
01:29:57,991 --> 01:30:00,755
No!

660
01:30:03,430 --> 01:30:07,196
Good news, boppers.
The big alert has been called off.

661
01:30:07,401 --> 01:30:11,895
It turns out that the early reports
were wrong, all wrong.

662
01:30:12,105 --> 01:30:16,439
Now for that group out there that had
such a hard time getting home,

663
01:30:16,643 --> 01:30:18,508
sorry about that.

664
01:30:18,712 --> 01:30:22,773
I guess the only thing we can do
is play you a song.
