1
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:57,074
It was 1947,
two years after the war...

2
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:00,077
when I began my journey
to what my father called...

3
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,080
the "Sodom" of the north:
New York.

4
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:08,085
Call me Stingo, which was the
nickname I was know by those days.

5
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,087
If I was called anything at all.

6
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:15,092
I've barely saved enough
money to write my novel...

7
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:20,097
for I wanted to be and hoped
or dreamed to be a writer.

8
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,100
But my spirit had remained locked...

9
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,104
unacquainted with love
and a stranger to death.

10
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:34,111
Even back then cheap apartments
were hard to find in Manhattan.

11
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:39,116
And so began my voyage of discovery...

12
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,120
in a place as strange as Brooklyn.

13
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,145
I know...

14
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:12,149
You're thinking about the pink.
Everybody does.

15
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:16,154
See, my late husband Saul,
he's got his bargain.

16
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:21,159
Hundreds and hundreds of gallons
of this... navy surplus paint.

17
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:26,164
See, I guess they didn't have
any use for pink on those boats.

18
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,168
Ok, I'll take it.

19
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,215
Walt Whitman.

20
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:25,223
"Yetta has heralded the arrival in the
Ethnic Kingdom of the pink palace...

21
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,225
of a young novelist from the south.

22
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:31,229
Your neighbors invite you upstairs
to dine with us in Sophie's room...

23
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,232
directly above yours tonight at eight.

24
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,234
The book is a token of welcome...

25
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:40,238
from one of Brooklyn's earliest
bards to Brooklyn's newest.

26
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,240
Sophie and Nathan".

27
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,276
- Whore!
- Don't go! Don't go!

28
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,286
Nathan, wait!

29
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,289
Wait! Believe me, Nathan!

30
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,297
I told you to get go away!

31
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,299
Stay away from my work!

32
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,301
Nathan, no!

33
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,305
- I'm not lying, you know!
- You're Lying.

34
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,307
- I'm not!
- You're Lying.

35
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,310
please, don't go!
Don't go away from me, please!

36
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,313
You know we need each other!
We need each other!

37
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,316
Me, need you?
Let me tell you something!

38
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,320
I need you like a goddamn
disease I can't name!

39
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:05,323
I need you like a case
of Anthrax, hear me?

40
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,325
Like "triquonosys"!

41
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:11,329
I need you like a biliary calculus,
palegra, encephalitis...

42
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,332
"Bright's" disease,
for Christ's sake!

43
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,334
"parsinoma" of the brain!

44
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,336
I need you... like death!

45
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,340
- Hear me? Like death!
- No, Nathan!

46
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,343
Go back to Krakow, baby.

47
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,345
Back to Krakow!

48
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,353
Well, good evening

49
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,355
Did you have a good time?

50
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,357
Did you enjoy our little show?

51
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,360
Do you get off on a little bit
of eve's dropping?

52
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,363
My door was open. I just
wondered what was going on.

53
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,366
Your door was open?
You wondered what was going on?

54
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:53,371
Well, shut my mouth if it isn't our
new literate figure from the South.

55
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:57,375
Too bad I won't be around for
a little lively conversation.

56
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,378
We would've had great time
shooting this shit.

57
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,381
We could've talked about sports...

58
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,383
Southern sports like...

59
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:09,387
lynching niggers, or coons
I think you all call them there.

60
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:14,392
So long cracker.
See you in another life.

61
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,396
Are you OK?

62
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,398
Yes.

63
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,401
Yeah.

64
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,410
I'm very sorry.

65
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,418
That's not the way he...

66
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,421
he really is, you know?

67
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,424
Don't apologize, all right?

68
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,428
I live downstairs here.
If there's anything you want...

69
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,429
Thank you.

70
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,434
You're very kind.

71
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,438
- Come on downstairs here.
- No, I'm all right.

72
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,445
I'm Stingo.

73
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,452
please... forgive us.

74
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,467
Yeah?

75
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,489
We had invited you to dinner.

76
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,492
That's very thoughtful of you.

77
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:59,497
Listen, I'm very often
working and I type at night.

78
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,500
But if it's going to bother you,
I don't want to...

79
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,503
Oh, no! When I was
little girl my father...

80
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,507
type and I go to sleep
to that sound.

81
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,511
It'll make me fell...

82
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,516
How do you say that?
Secure. Secured.

83
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,521
- Your father was a writer?
- You know, my father was...

84
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:27,525
my father was professor of law.
He wrote articles...

85
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:31,529
warning college people
of the Nazi threat...

86
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:36,534
and trying to get help for those
Jews that "was" persecuted. So...

87
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,538
Yeah, that sound of typing
will make me think of my father...

88
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,541
and of his goodness.

89
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,544
You wouldn't want to
come in, would you?

90
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,547
Maybe some other time.

91
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,549
So, if you forgive me...

92
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,509
Good night.

93
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,554
So, "Stinko", yeah?

94
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,557
- "Stingo".
- "Stingo", yes!

95
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,561
I never hear that name.

96
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,563
There's no "K" in there, though.

97
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,565
- I got it.
- It's a "G".

98
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,568
Yeah, it's nice!

99
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,572
It's a friendly...
you know, happy sound.

100
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,574
I like it.

101
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:11,647
Nathan!

102
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,694
Oh, Nathan!

103
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,702
Oh, God!

104
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,714
Why can't you see, Sophie?
We are dying.

105
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:46,724
Rise and shine, honey child.
Lift up your bones.

106
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,727
The grit is on the brittle,
the corn is on the pone.

107
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,730
Hurry up.

108
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:56,734
You're going to have a picnic
out and down by the seashore.

109
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,737
- Good morning, Stingo.
- Good morning.

110
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,740
We wanted to make friends...

111
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:06,744
and to take you out on
this beautiful summer day!

112
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,747
We want you to come up and
to have breakfast with us.

113
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,749
- And then...
- Yes.

114
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,751
- Coney Island.
- Coney Island! Oh, boy!

115
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,755
Sorry about last night.

116
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:53,791
I know what you're thinking:
"These people are strange".

117
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,795
On Sundays we like to dress up
a bit differently and go out.

118
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,799
- OK.
- OK?

119
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,801
I knew you'd understand!

120
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,804
You see, everybody out
there dresses the same.

121
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,807
Look at those poor, pathetic
people out there. Look at them.

122
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,811
Drones. All walking down the
streets looking alike, wearing...

123
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,813
the same dread, boring uniform.

124
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,816
You're boring!
"Good morning"!

125
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,820
Look at this God's gift!

126
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,823
Give me a kiss.

127
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,826
- One kiss.
- All right, one kiss.

128
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,828
- That's all you deserve.
- One more.

129
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,830
- I need one more.
- No.

130
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,832
- I have to have one more.
- Nathan!

131
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,834
Look where my hands have to go.

132
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,837
This is...
No, Nathan Landau!

133
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,839
What do you think of that, Stingo?

134
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,841
Here I am, a nice Jewish boy...

135
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,843
pushing thirty...

136
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,847
I fall crazy in love
with a polish Shiksa.

137
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,849
What is that?
What is a Shiksa?

138
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:56,854
A Shiksa? Is a "goee" girl.
A lady of a gentile persuasion.

139
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:58,814
She's a...

140
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,860
All right. I'd just assumed
that she was not...

141
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,862
- Jewish, Jewish?
- Yeah.

142
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:06,823
Jewish?

143
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,867
No, no, no...
Sophie is Catholic.

144
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,872
That's OK. But I'm
not anymore Catholic, so...

145
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,875
Catholic issue.

146
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,879
When I first met this one here...

147
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,882
she was a rag and bone
and hank of hair.

148
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:28,886
That was 1 year and a half after the
Russians liberated the camp she was in.

149
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,890
Yeah, it looked like
something that...

150
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,893
scares the birds.
You know, what is that?

151
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,895
Scare... scarecrow.

152
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,898
- I had "scurbut".
- No, no, no!

153
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,902
She means scurvy.
And typhus, anemia, fever...

154
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:48,906
It was a miracle she's
emerged from that camp alive.

155
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,908
Right! I mean...

156
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,911
He thought that I had leukemia.

157
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,915
I thought I was dying.

158
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,919
But it was Nathan that see
that it was only anemia.

159
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,922
- Are you a doctor?
- No, no.

160
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,924
That's my brother's domain.

161
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,926
- But I'm a biologist.
- Yeah!

162
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,929
I graduated in Science from Harvard.

163
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,932
And he made MA...

164
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,936
in Developmental
and Cellular Biology.

165
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,940
- I do research now.
- He works at Pfizer.

166
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,942
A big pharmaceutical
house in Brooklyn.

167
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,946
Anyway, I took her to
this friend of my brother's...

168
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,949
a doctor who teaches
at Columbia Presbyterian.

169
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,951
- Yeah.
- He confirmed my diagnosis.

170
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,954
And we put the little sweetie here...

171
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,956
on a massive doses
of ferrous sulphate...

172
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,959
and she'd bloomed like a rose.

173
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:44,921
A rose.

174
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:47,924
A rose...

175
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,969
A beautiful fucking rose.

176
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,974
You're something!

177
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,977
Thank you for making me
"to" bloom like a rose.

178
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,989
Not "to" bloom, just "bloom".

179
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,992
She's so good.
It's about time she was perfect.

180
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,995
So what? I mean, this is
a ridiculous language!

181
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,997
There's too many words!

182
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,000
The word for "velocity":
OK, there's "fast", "quick"...

183
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,003
"rapid" and they all
mean the same thing.

184
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,005
- "Swift", "Speedy"...
- "Hasty".

185
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,007
- "Flit".
- "Brisk".

186
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,009
- "Expeditious".
- "Accelerated".

187
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:32,969
"Winged".

188
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,013
No, no! Stop it!

189
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,016
It's ridiculous!

190
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:43,020
Oh, in French it's so easy.
You say: "vit".

191
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:47,024
Or in polish, "szybko"
and in Russian, "bistroy"

192
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:50,027
It's only in English
that it's so complicated!

193
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,029
How many languages do you know?

194
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,031
Well, my father was a Linguistic,
so I mean, I...

195
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:58,035
He taught me German, French,
Russian, Hungarian...

196
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,037
the Slavic Languages...

197
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,041
So, what language
I'm butchering now?

198
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,002
English!

199
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:09,046
I bet your father was
a very interesting man.

200
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,053
Yeah, my father was...

201
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,057
a civilized man.

202
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:28,065
- That's the word, yeah? "Civilized"?
- Very good word.

203
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:33,070
Yeah? My father was a civilized man
living in a non civilized time.

204
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,073
The civilized,
they "was" the first to die.

205
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,078
Do you play the piano?

206
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,080
No. I used to play, but I...

207
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,086
I no longer play.

208
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,090
I don't, anymore...

209
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,093
My mother was a beautiful pianist.

210
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,103
Nathan surprised me with
that piano on my birthday!

211
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,132
I love that piece.

212
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,149
When I was a little girl, I...

213
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,152
I remember, I'd lay in bed...

214
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:59,157
and I'd hear my mother
downstairs playing the piano...

215
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,162
and the sound of my
father's typewriter.

216
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:11,169
I think no child had a more
wonderful father and mother.

217
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,178
And a more beautiful life.

218
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,197
Do you know that song, right?

219
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,215
Stingo, hit it!

220
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,284
Suddenly, I shivered violently.

221
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:11,289
I remembered Nathan's voice
that night before.

222
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:16,294
"Dont you see, Sophie?
We 're dying".

223
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,297
I longed desperately to escape...

224
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,300
to pack my bags and flee.

225
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,303
But I did not.

226
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:29,307
I stayed at Yetta Zimmerman's...

227
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,311
and I helped fulfill Sophie's
prophecy about the three of us.

228
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,314
We became the best of friends.

229
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:17,415
Here's an example of how
emotionally evocative English can be

230
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:20,418
Sophie loved to tell
how Nathan saved her life.

231
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,421
Their meeting was, for her...

232
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,423
a miracle.

233
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:30,428
Because I could not stop for
death, he kindly stopped for me.

234
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:35,433
The carriage held but just
our selves and Immortality.

235
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:40,438
Rhymes, rhymes... It's not hard
enough to understand the language?

236
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:44,442
Just everyday life talk.
He has to read us rhymes!

237
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:47,445
...what the beauty of
the language can be...

238
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,447
when written by artists.

239
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,451
I look forward to seeing you
next week. And remember...

240
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,454
You must not get discouraged.

241
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,456
You'll see.

242
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:02,460
One morning you'll wake up and find
you've been dreaming in English!

243
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,464
Excuse me. Who did he
say wrote that poem?

244
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:07,423
Dickens.

245
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,467
- Emile Dickens.
- Thank you.

246
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,484
Are you all right, Miss Zawistowska?

247
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:34,450
Yes.

248
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:41,499
Thank you, I'm very fine.
I'm a little tired.

249
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,501
I noticed that you've been looking...

250
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,504
Well... a little delicate lately.

251
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:51,467
- I hope I'm not being too personal.
- No! No, I...

252
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,470
Could you help me with that?

253
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,479
Thank you.

254
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,484
Thank you for your...

255
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,486
concern.

256
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,496
Good bye.

257
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:48,524
Excuse me, sir.
Could you tell me what...

258
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:54,530
Where would be that listing
in catalog file...

259
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:56,532
for...

260
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,538
19th century American poet...

261
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:08,544
- Emile Dickens, please?
- In the catalog room on the left.

262
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,548
But you wont find any such listing.

263
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,552
I wont find that listing?

264
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,557
Why won't I... find it?

265
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,563
Charles Dickens is
an English writer.

266
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:31,567
There's no American poet
by the name of Dickens.

267
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:39,575
I'm sorry. No, that is,
I'm sure, American poet.

268
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,580
- Emile Dickens.
- Listen!

269
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,583
- "D-I...
- I told you!

270
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:51,587
There's no such person. Do you
want me to draw you a picture?

271
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,589
- I'm telling you, you hear me?
- All right.

272
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,609
It's all right, it's all right...

273
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,617
Just lie still.

274
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,620
Let the doctor take
care of everything.

275
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,625
You're so beautiful.

276
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,629
Yes! How did you get
to be so beautiful?

277
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:36,632
I think...

278
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,636
I think that I'm going to die.

279
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:44,640
No, no, no...

280
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,643
No, your pulse...

281
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,647
Your pulse is fine.
It's steady.

282
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,651
You're going to live to be a hundred.

283
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:01,717
Why I am so tired?

284
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:05,721
The doctor thinks you
need to get some color...

285
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:07,723
in that beautiful
white skin of yours.

286
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:10,726
I'm going to take you
to see my brother.

287
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:13,729
He is the best doctor going.

288
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:19,735
- No, let you...
- You thought I was a doctor?

289
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,737
No, I'm a biologist.

290
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:26,742
- You've been eating properly lately?
- Yes! Oh, yes! I am...

291
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,748
I am six months in
here, in U.S. and...

292
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:39,755
so I eat "more good"
now than in my life.

293
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:44,760
You could've fallen behind with iron
and never had a chance to catch up.

294
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:47,763
Look, I'm going to go now.

295
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:51,767
But may I come back later?
Don't answer that. I'll be back.

296
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:58,774
OK?

297
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:02,778
Yeah, OK!

298
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,808
- How long you have been there?
- Enough to get dinner started.

299
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:37,813
You look much better.

300
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,817
What did you do here?

301
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:45,822
It looks beautiful.

302
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:47,824
We're having calf's liver...

303
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,829
prepared "Veneziano" and
special vinaigrette sauce...

304
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,831
loaded with iron.

305
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,834
And leeks... filled with iron.

306
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,837
Also will improve the
timber of your voice.

307
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:06,843
You know, Nero had
leek served every day...

308
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:09,846
- to deepen his voice.
- I didn't know that.

309
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:14,851
So that he could croon while he
had Seneca drown and squirted.

310
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:19,856
- Let me help you with that.
- No! You're not to move.

311
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,865
The "madame" taste the wine?

312
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:32,869
"Chateaux Margoux de...

313
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:35,872
1937"?

314
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,874
My God!

315
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,876
Special day...

316
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,878
special wine.

317
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,905
You know, when you...

318
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:14,911
When you live a good life...

319
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:19,916
like a saint and then you die...

320
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:27,924
that must be what they make
you "to" drink in paradise.

321
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:43,940
Thomas Wolfe!

322
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:54,951
It's written in polish!

323
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,959
Oh God! What does Wolfe
sound like in polish?

324
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,978
a stone, a leaf, an unfound door.

325
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,984
Of a stone...

326
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:33,990
- The door.
- The door.

327
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,998
- Of all the forgotten faces.
- Forgotten faces.

328
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:45,001
God! This is a first...

329
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:53,009
hearing Thomas Wolfe
read aloud in polish.

330
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:58,014
The first for me too, hearing
Wolfe read in English.

331
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:06,022
If that poor bastard have heard
you read this aloud in polish...

332
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:09,025
- he would've written in polish.
- I don't think so.

333
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,027
Oh, yeah! Oh, yes!

334
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:20,036
You were... You were in
that concentration camp?

335
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,042
Yeah, I can't...

336
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:31,047
- I can't talk about that, though.
- I'm sorry.

337
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:36,052
I have a neck to stick my big
nose where it's got no business.

338
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,056
I...

339
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:43,059
want so much to know you.

340
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:47,063
To be close to you.

341
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:57,073
Emily Dickenson?

342
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:00,076
That's the woman?

343
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:02,078
Oh, no!

344
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:07,083
"property of Nathan Landau".

345
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,085
- That's you?
- That's me.

346
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:12,088
- It's your book?
- No, it's yours.

347
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:17,093
Thank you!

348
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:19,095
Thank you.

349
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:35,111
"Ample make this bed.

350
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:39,115
Make this bed with awe;

351
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:44,120
In it wait till judgment break...

352
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:47,123
excellent and fair.

353
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:52,128
Be its mattress straight.

354
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:55,131
Be its pillow round;

355
00:36:57,258 --> 00:37:00,136
Let no sunrise yellow noise...

356
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,140
interrupt this ground".

357
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:20,156
Nathan, my new and
dear beloved friend...

358
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:24,160
introduced me to what seemed
the answer to my relentless...

359
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,162
all consuming "hornyness".

360
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:30,166
Before I went into analysis,
I was completely frigid.

361
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:34,170
Can you imagine? Now all I
can do is think about fucking.

362
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:37,173
Wilhelm Reich has turned
me into a nympho.

363
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:40,176
I mean, sex on the brain!

364
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:44,180
Her name still crawls
across my tongue.

365
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:46,182
Lesley Lapidus.

366
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:50,186
The door is open, came in!

367
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:54,190
Hello!

368
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:13,209
- Boy, look excellent.
- Thanks.

369
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:20,216
- What would like to drink?
- I'll have a...

370
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:25,221
I don't know, let's see...

371
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:31,227
- I'd like a red wine.
- Oh, my God!

372
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:33,229
Fuck!

373
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:36,232
Fucking fantastic fucking!

374
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,244
Wait! Just let it ring!

375
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:55,251
Hello, mother.

376
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:58,254
Fine, fine. I told
you I'd be just fine.

377
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,259
Yeah, plenty. And I'll make sure
that the plants are watered...

378
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:06,262
and that the dog is fed.
Well, mother...

379
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:09,265
Yes, Daddy. Your little
princess will be good.

380
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,267
OK. Bye!

381
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:16,272
They'll go away for the weekend
and the maid is out sick.

382
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:20,276
And they care about how I will
survive for a weekend in this...

383
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:26,324
apartment by myself. So they stocked
the fridge, put a lock on every door...

384
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,284
and who knows what else!

385
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:36,292
Thus I realized that Lesley and I
would be left to frolic here alone.

386
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,294
My cup ran over.

387
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:43,299
Oh, my cup turned into a spillway
flooding across the spotless carpet...

388
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:46,302
out the door down
Pierrepot Street...

389
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:50,306
across all the twilit
carnal reaches of Brooklyn.

390
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:56,312
Lesley. A weekend
alone with Lesley.

391
00:39:57,438 --> 00:40:01,317
Have you ever read D.H. Lawrence,
"Lady Chatterley's Lover"?

392
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:03,319
No.

393
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:06,322
He has the answer.

394
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:09,325
He knows so much about fucking.

395
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:11,327
He says...

396
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:16,332
He says that when you fuck
you go to the Dark Gods.

397
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,335
Stingo, I really mean it.

398
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:23,339
To fuck is to go to the Dark Gods.

399
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,344
Let's go to the Dark Gods!

400
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:09,385
What is going on?

401
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:12,388
You don't understand...

402
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:15,391
I can't go all the way.

403
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,397
I've reached a plateau
in my analysis.

404
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:26,402
Before I reach this plateau of
vocalization I could never say...

405
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:28,404
any of those words.

406
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:34,410
those Anglo-Saxon four letter words
that everybody should be able to say

407
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:37,413
Now I'm completely able to vocalize.

408
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:45,421
Lesley Lapidus could say "fuck"
but she could not do it.

409
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:54,430
Nathan!? I'm so glad you're...

410
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:58,434
Yep, little Stingo.

411
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:02,438
- Stingo?
- Yeah?

412
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:08,444
You want to come up and
have a night cup with me?

413
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:09,445
Sure.

414
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:14,450
When Nathan gets involved
he forgets all about the time...

415
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:24,460
Stingo, you look... very nice.
You're wearing your "cock sucker".

416
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:28,464
My seersucker.

417
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:31,467
Oh yeah.
Right, "seersucker".

418
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:46,482
I love it here.

419
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:53,489
I'm glad you couldn't sleep.

420
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:01,497
You hurt your mouth?
You talk funny.

421
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:03,499
I bit my tongue.

422
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:07,503
- You want me to get you something?
- No, please, no.

423
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:09,505
It just needs to be left alone.

424
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:14,510
You changed all
the furniture around?

425
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:19,515
Yeah, you like it? I do that
when I can't sleep, you know?

426
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,518
It's good, because
then you don't have...

427
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:25,521
You don't have to
think about anything.

428
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:30,526
- Well, then I'll try that.
- Oh, no.

429
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:36,532
Stingo... You do not
have to move furniture.

430
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:44,540
- You will move mountains.
- I can't even move my tongue.

431
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:46,542
Maybe you moved it too much.

432
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:53,549
Why aren't all the women
in the world like you?

433
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:57,553
You'd better thank God they're not.
I see many women in your life.

434
00:43:57,678 --> 00:43:59,555
Many beautiful women...

435
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,559
who adore you and that make
all that love with you.

436
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:05,561
Sometimes...

437
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:10,566
I can see myself just
being alone forever.

438
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:14,570
Oh, Stingo...
I'm not fair with you.

439
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:18,574
I think Stingo is so young,
he is a talented American.

440
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:24,580
He doesn't have any real,
real problems, but...

441
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:26,582
You don't know if I'm talented.

442
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:29,585
You've never read
anything I've written.

443
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,588
I don't ask about your work...

444
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:36,592
and what it is about because
I know a writer likes to...

445
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:39,595
be quite about his work.

446
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:43,599
It's about a boy...

447
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:46,602
a twelve-year-old boy...

448
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:50,606
- And...
- So it's autobiographical?

449
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:56,612
To a certain extant, maybe it is.

450
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:02,618
It takes places in a year,
which is the year his mother dies...

451
00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:10,626
I didn't know your mother died.

452
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:14,630
- When I was 12.
- You loved her very much?

453
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:16,632
Not enough.

454
00:45:16,757 --> 00:45:20,636
- What do you mean, "Not enough"?
- I mean: "Not enough".

455
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:28,644
And that's what is
so terrible about...

456
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:36,652
outliving those people
that we love, I mean that...

457
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:40,656
- that quilt.
- Your father?

458
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:43,659
My father, my mother, my husband.

459
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:47,663
You were married?

460
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:52,668
Yeah, I was married.

461
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:56,672
And I was very young.
I was married to a...

462
00:45:57,798 --> 00:45:59,675
disciple of my father.

463
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,678
Assistant at the University.

464
00:46:03,804 --> 00:46:06,682
Your father was writing
Nazi articles?

465
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:09,685
That probably got him into trouble.

466
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:13,689
One day I was at the Mass and...

467
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:16,692
they have a...

468
00:46:19,821 --> 00:46:21,697
I had a...

469
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:23,699
"presentiment" and I...

470
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:26,702
have money for you and I...

471
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:31,707
I run out of the church and
I go to the University...

472
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:34,710
and I see that the
gate is locked and...

473
00:46:34,836 --> 00:46:37,713
there were many Germans there...

474
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:42,718
and I saw the professors. They
"was" loading them into the truck...

475
00:46:42,844 --> 00:46:46,722
and this one part of canvas
has moved away...

476
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:52,728
and I see my father's face and
the face of my husband behind him.

477
00:46:53,855 --> 00:46:54,730
And...

478
00:46:57,859 --> 00:46:59,735
I looked and the...

479
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:03,739
But the Germans
pulled that away and...

480
00:47:03,865 --> 00:47:06,742
I never saw those faces again.

481
00:47:06,868 --> 00:47:13,749
They took them to Sachsenhausen,
but they shot them the next day.

482
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,757
- And your mother?
- My mother...

483
00:47:21,883 --> 00:47:23,759
My mother got...

484
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:29,765
t- t-tuberculosis.
Tuberculosis and...

485
00:47:31,893 --> 00:47:36,772
She is very sick, you know?
She's dying. I can't do anything.

486
00:47:39,901 --> 00:47:44,780
But I think if I could get
that meet for my mother...

487
00:47:44,906 --> 00:47:48,784
I would make her strong, so
I go to the country and...

488
00:47:49,911 --> 00:47:52,788
the peasants,
they're selling... ham.

489
00:47:53,915 --> 00:47:58,794
And I go with that black market
money and I buy that and...

490
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,799
I bring it back. But it's forbidden
for all the meet goes to the Germans

491
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:05,801
If you get caught...

492
00:48:06,928 --> 00:48:10,806
So I hid the ham under
my skirt on the train.

493
00:48:10,932 --> 00:48:13,809
I'm pretending that I'm
pregnant, you know?

494
00:48:13,935 --> 00:48:15,811
I was so afraid!

495
00:48:16,938 --> 00:48:19,815
I was shaking.
And then that German...

496
00:48:22,944 --> 00:48:25,822
who was in the front of
the train and he saw me.

497
00:48:25,947 --> 00:48:28,825
And I'm sitting there
and he "come" up to me...

498
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:31,828
and he "take" under
my skirt that ham and...

499
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,837
So they sent me to Auschwitz.

500
00:48:43,965 --> 00:48:47,844
You were sent to Auschwitz
because you stole a ham?

501
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:51,848
No. I was sent to Auschwitz
because they saw that I was afraid.

502
00:48:57,979 --> 00:48:59,856
- You know what that means.
- Yeah.

503
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:03,860
You tried to commit
suicide in Auschwitz.

504
00:49:04,986 --> 00:49:06,863
No, it was after that.

505
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:09,866
After that, I was in...

506
00:49:12,994 --> 00:49:15,872
- After liberation.
- After you were safe?

507
00:49:15,997 --> 00:49:17,874
Yes, safe, yeah.

508
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:23,880
I was safe, I was in Sweden.
I was in that refugee camp.

509
00:49:26,007 --> 00:49:29,886
I mean, that was good.
They try to help you, you know?

510
00:49:31,012 --> 00:49:32,889
They try... but...

511
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,897
I knew that...

512
00:49:43,024 --> 00:49:47,904
Christ had turned his
face away from me...

513
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:53,910
and that only a Jesus who
no longer cared for me could...

514
00:49:54,035 --> 00:49:56,913
kill those people
that I love, but...

515
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,917
leave me alive...

516
00:50:02,043 --> 00:50:05,922
with my shame? Oh, God.
So I went to that church...

517
00:50:07,048 --> 00:50:09,926
and I took the glass
I knew was there and I...

518
00:50:11,052 --> 00:50:13,930
I've cut my wrist.

519
00:50:14,055 --> 00:50:16,933
But I didn't die, of course!

520
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:19,936
Of course, not.

521
00:50:32,073 --> 00:50:33,950
Stingo...

522
00:50:34,075 --> 00:50:36,953
there's so many things
you don't understand.

523
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,958
There's so many things
that I can't...

524
00:50:44,085 --> 00:50:46,963
that I cannot... tell you.

525
00:50:47,088 --> 00:50:48,965
I want you to trust me.

526
00:50:53,094 --> 00:50:54,971
I want you to trust me.

527
00:50:57,098 --> 00:50:58,975
Just trust me.

528
00:51:11,112 --> 00:51:13,990
Oh, God! There's Nathan!

529
00:51:16,117 --> 00:51:16,993
Nathan!

530
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:21,998
- Sophie!
- Astrid?

531
00:51:23,124 --> 00:51:27,003
I'm working night duty at
Brooklyn Hospital this week.

532
00:51:27,128 --> 00:51:31,007
My patient is this old lady
who's meaner than my mother!

533
00:51:31,132 --> 00:51:34,010
Well, good night, Astrid.
I'll go to sleep.

534
00:51:35,136 --> 00:51:37,013
That was Astrid, you know.

535
00:51:38,139 --> 00:51:42,018
Maybe I'll leave the door open in
case he comes, we could hear him.

536
00:51:42,143 --> 00:51:44,020
So you want another drink?

537
00:51:45,146 --> 00:51:47,023
- Your bottle is empty.
- Well...

538
00:51:48,149 --> 00:51:51,027
I know where Nathan
keeps another bottle.

539
00:51:55,156 --> 00:51:57,033
Be careful, it's dark in here.

540
00:52:03,164 --> 00:52:04,040
Oh, God.

541
00:52:04,165 --> 00:52:08,044
You'll feel better if we
just call him at the lab.

542
00:52:10,171 --> 00:52:14,050
I can't do that. He doesn't
like for me to call him.

543
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:16,052
You know, at work.

544
00:52:17,178 --> 00:52:19,055
So, anyway...

545
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:22,058
I did it an hour ago!

546
00:52:22,183 --> 00:52:24,060
And there was no answer, so...

547
00:52:24,185 --> 00:52:26,062
I'm sure the switchboard
just shot off.

548
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:28,064
Yes, I think that's right.

549
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:33,069
I'm sure of that. You know,
sometimes when he can't sleep...

550
00:52:33,194 --> 00:52:35,071
he goes and walks
all over the city.

551
00:52:36,197 --> 00:52:39,075
He goes into all
these neighborhoods...

552
00:52:40,201 --> 00:52:44,080
I don't know where he goes, but...
Once he came back, he had a...

553
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:49,085
black eye and his jaw
was all swollen there.

554
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:52,088
I thought it was broken!

555
00:52:56,217 --> 00:52:58,094
You know, he could be hurt.

556
00:52:58,219 --> 00:53:02,098
I don't know where he is, but I
think we should call the police.

557
00:53:02,223 --> 00:53:05,101
- Right now.
- I think we'd better wait 2 hours.

558
00:53:05,226 --> 00:53:08,104
Wait till someone is
on the switchboard there.

559
00:53:08,229 --> 00:53:10,106
We'll just call him then.

560
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:13,109
His working lady probably got
tired and fell asleep there.

561
00:53:14,235 --> 00:53:17,113
Yeah. She's probably asleep there.

562
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,117
- I'm sure.
- I'm sure you're right.

563
00:53:27,248 --> 00:53:29,125
Look at this. Nazi primer.

564
00:53:32,253 --> 00:53:36,132
He must have everything written
about the Nazis in those news.

565
00:53:36,257 --> 00:53:40,136
He is obsessed with the Nazis
who are escaping justice.

566
00:53:41,262 --> 00:53:44,140
Do you suppose all this
started after he met you?

567
00:53:44,265 --> 00:53:48,144
Look, I know I shouldn't tell
him about that place, but...

568
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:52,148
what could I do? I know
it's not my fault that he...

569
00:53:52,273 --> 00:53:55,151
I can understand.
After all, he is a Jew.

570
00:53:56,277 --> 00:53:59,155
Yes, but don't you think
that I'm angry too?

571
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,159
That these men, these terrible
Nazi leaving my father...

572
00:54:04,285 --> 00:54:08,164
Such a good man who tries
to help Jews is killed!

573
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:12,168
Don't you think that I am angry?
But you don't understand Nathan.

574
00:54:14,295 --> 00:54:16,172
You don't know...

575
00:54:22,303 --> 00:54:24,180
...him.
What he might do, you know?

576
00:54:24,305 --> 00:54:27,183
- Sometimes I think...
- What do you think?

577
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:34,190
- What do you think, polish baby?
- Oh, Nathan!

578
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:41,197
- You're all right?
- I am. What about the two of you?

579
00:54:42,323 --> 00:54:45,201
I was so frightened, you know?

580
00:54:45,326 --> 00:54:47,203
I was stupid!

581
00:54:47,328 --> 00:54:51,207
I got so scared that something
had happened to you.

582
00:54:51,332 --> 00:54:54,210
I would've called
but I didn't want to wake you.

583
00:54:54,335 --> 00:54:57,213
We're on to something in our work.
Something big. Very big.

584
00:54:57,338 --> 00:54:59,215
That's wonderful, Nathan.

585
00:55:02,343 --> 00:55:04,220
Yeah, wonderful.

586
00:55:15,356 --> 00:55:17,233
But you were here...

587
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,237
with Sophie.

588
00:55:22,363 --> 00:55:27,243
Stingo, you know, he...
Stingo came home from his date!

589
00:55:28,369 --> 00:55:31,247
So I heard the door
and thought it was you.

590
00:55:31,372 --> 00:55:33,249
So I run out, but...

591
00:55:33,374 --> 00:55:38,254
Anyway, I called him and said
why don't you come up for a drink?

592
00:55:38,379 --> 00:55:42,258
Because I was worried and
he was a very good friend...

593
00:55:42,383 --> 00:55:45,261
and he was keeping me company.

594
00:56:01,402 --> 00:56:05,281
So now you've seen my
"sanctum sanctorum".

595
00:56:06,407 --> 00:56:10,286
Now you know all of Nathan's
darkened hours secrets.

596
00:56:11,412 --> 00:56:12,288
Hardly.

597
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:23,299
You wipe out six million Jews...

598
00:56:23,424 --> 00:56:30,306
and the world left them escape.

599
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:33,309
Enjoying our Lynching
party southern boy?

600
00:56:33,434 --> 00:56:37,313
I expect you might have
a lot to teach me there.

601
00:56:38,439 --> 00:56:40,316
I'm going to call it tonight.

602
00:56:41,442 --> 00:56:46,322
Stingo, wait. Stingo is our
best friend, why do you do that?

603
00:56:47,448 --> 00:56:51,327
He is our best friend, he deserves
only our thanks. Listen to me.

604
00:56:52,453 --> 00:56:56,332
I was frightened,
I didn't know what to do here.

605
00:57:03,464 --> 00:57:05,341
It's true.

606
00:57:15,476 --> 00:57:17,353
Forgive me old buddy. I'm sorry.

607
00:57:18,479 --> 00:57:20,356
Of course my beloved Sophie is right

608
00:57:21,482 --> 00:57:24,360
I must've got crazy
with the work, you know?

609
00:57:24,485 --> 00:57:27,363
- We're on to something big.
- I know, darling.

610
00:57:27,488 --> 00:57:29,365
I'm just another mad scientist.

611
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:31,367
I'm leaving.

612
00:57:32,493 --> 00:57:33,369
Tomorrow.

613
00:57:34,495 --> 00:57:36,372
Thank you.

614
00:57:37,498 --> 00:57:40,376
- Thanks for taking care of Sophie.
- All right.

615
00:57:47,508 --> 00:57:50,386
- Ah, Nathan!
- I'm sorry.

616
00:57:50,511 --> 00:57:52,388
I said I'm sorry already!

617
00:57:57,518 --> 00:57:59,395
Darling, I'm home.

618
00:58:04,525 --> 00:58:06,402
- Right!
- Are you all right?

619
00:58:07,528 --> 00:58:09,405
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

620
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:11,407
Don't you catch things in the South?

621
00:58:14,535 --> 00:58:17,413
- How's it going?
- Fine. What's going on?

622
00:58:17,538 --> 00:58:18,414
Think fast!

623
00:58:23,544 --> 00:58:25,421
You came and wreck everything.

624
00:58:25,546 --> 00:58:28,424
Yetta, you know,
always provides the best...

625
00:58:28,549 --> 00:58:31,427
the best you can find in Brooklyn!

626
00:58:31,552 --> 00:58:33,429
Oh, shit!

627
00:58:35,556 --> 00:58:37,433
Sophie should be taking
a nap after work.

628
00:58:40,561 --> 00:58:44,440
She just doesn't sleep anymore.
Not since the war. How's it going?

629
00:58:44,565 --> 00:58:47,443
- Fine. Thank you.
- Let me take a look at those.

630
00:58:47,568 --> 00:58:49,445
.- No.
- Come on!

631
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:53,449
I won't interfere, I won't make
any comments, I won't even...

632
00:58:53,574 --> 00:58:56,452
Look, I'll show this to no one!
No one is seeing this.

633
00:58:56,577 --> 00:59:00,456
I'm not no one. I'm a friend.
Don't you have those down South?

634
00:59:00,581 --> 00:59:05,461
"Friend", a person attached to
another by feeling and affection.

635
00:59:05,586 --> 00:59:08,464
- A supporter.
- I vowed to my self when I started..

636
00:59:08,589 --> 00:59:11,467
this I was not going to show it
to anyone 'till I finish it.

637
00:59:11,592 --> 00:59:14,470
- Then I'd go for that comfort person.
- Well...

638
00:59:16,597 --> 00:59:20,476
OK. Youre just terrified
that somebody don't like it.

639
00:59:20,601 --> 00:59:25,481
Terrified as in filled with terror.
As sharp over mastering intense fear

640
00:59:25,606 --> 00:59:27,483
All right, all right!

641
00:59:31,612 --> 00:59:34,490
- That will give you some idea.
- Oh, my God!

642
00:59:36,617 --> 00:59:40,496
- What about the page in the typewriter?
- No, this is a...

643
00:59:40,621 --> 00:59:42,498
Nathan! Stop!

644
00:59:43,624 --> 00:59:44,500
All right.

645
00:59:46,627 --> 00:59:49,505
Stingo! What is the
worst that can happen?

646
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:52,508
I may discover you can't write!

647
00:59:52,633 --> 00:59:55,511
- Bye! Shit! Fuck!
- Nathan, get back here!

648
00:59:55,636 --> 00:59:57,513
I'll give it back, old buddy!

649
01:00:00,641 --> 01:00:02,518
Fine, right!

650
01:00:04,645 --> 01:00:06,522
Stingo, wait a minute!

651
01:00:07,648 --> 01:00:11,527
Wait! Nathan has ordered me
to take you to the movies.

652
01:00:11,652 --> 01:00:14,530
He made me your guardian
while to read that.

653
01:00:14,655 --> 01:00:18,534
Yes, so you can't do no
violence to yourself now.

654
01:00:23,664 --> 01:00:26,542
- Nathan must have finished that.
- Yeah.

655
01:00:26,667 --> 01:00:29,545
- Come on, let's go see.
- I think I'll wait here alone.

656
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,548
- No, come on!
- If he's got something to say...

657
01:00:32,673 --> 01:00:35,551
- let him come down and tell me.
- Don't be silly.

658
01:01:20,721 --> 01:01:21,597
Bravo!

659
01:02:43,804 --> 01:02:45,681
On this bridge on which...

660
01:02:46,807 --> 01:02:50,686
so many great Americans writers
stood and reached out for words...

661
01:02:50,811 --> 01:02:52,688
to give America its voice...

662
01:02:55,816 --> 01:02:58,694
looking toward the land
that gave them Whitman...

663
01:02:58,819 --> 01:03:03,699
from its Eastern edge dreamt his
country's future and gave it words...

664
01:03:05,827 --> 01:03:07,703
on this span of which...

665
01:03:09,831 --> 01:03:11,707
Thomas Wolfe
and Hart Crane wrote...

666
01:03:14,836 --> 01:03:18,714
we welcome Stingo
into that pantheon of the Gods...

667
01:03:20,842 --> 01:03:24,720
whose words are
all we know of immortality.

668
01:03:30,852 --> 01:03:32,728
To Stingo!

669
01:03:44,866 --> 01:03:49,745
How could I've failed to have
the most helpless crush on such...

670
01:03:49,871 --> 01:03:52,748
a generous mind
and life enlarging mentor?

671
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:57,753
Nathan was utterly,
fatally glamorous.

672
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,757
Sophie!

673
01:04:02,967 --> 01:04:04,886
Where are you?

674
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:06,888
- Stingo!
- Nathan!

675
01:04:11,976 --> 01:04:14,896
- We did it!
- What? What did you do?

676
01:04:21,986 --> 01:04:23,905
Nathan!

677
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:30,912
Remember I told you we were on to
something big? Today we cracked it.

678
01:04:30,995 --> 01:04:32,914
What? What, what?

679
01:04:34,999 --> 01:04:37,919
I can't tell you.
You'll hear about it all tonight.

680
01:04:38,002 --> 01:04:41,923
- No, what's a few hours make?
- No, I can't tell you!

681
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,926
pretty soon the whole world
will know...

682
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:49,931
one of the greatest medical
advances of all time.

683
01:04:52,016 --> 01:04:53,935
I can't tell you!

684
01:04:57,021 --> 01:05:00,942
I'm talking about Stockholm.
Next year, the three of us together.

685
01:05:01,025 --> 01:05:02,944
I'm talking to go
nobel-fucking-prize!

686
01:05:03,027 --> 01:05:05,947
- All right!
- Sorry, kid. I'm going to get there first!

687
01:05:07,031 --> 01:05:09,951
Wait! I got something
for you to celebrate!

688
01:05:10,034 --> 01:05:11,953
Oh, Nathan! What's that?

689
01:05:13,037 --> 01:05:15,957
- One for you.
- What is it?

690
01:05:17,041 --> 01:05:19,961
- These go with that one.
- Oh, God!

691
01:05:21,045 --> 01:05:24,966
- Oh, Nathan! What a beautiful dress!
- Do you like it?

692
01:05:29,053 --> 01:05:32,974
Try it on. put it on.
Come on, try it on!

693
01:05:34,058 --> 01:05:35,977
- Oh, Nathan!
- Come on!

694
01:05:38,062 --> 01:05:40,982
Try it on.
please, I want to see it.

695
01:05:41,065 --> 01:05:43,985
- I'm not going to do that.
- I just want to see it on you!

696
01:05:44,068 --> 01:05:45,987
Hold it up.

697
01:05:47,071 --> 01:05:49,991
- It doesn't have a top.
- You're the top.

698
01:05:50,074 --> 01:05:51,993
Nathan, it's beautiful!

699
01:05:54,078 --> 01:05:57,999
- I've to get back to the laboratory.
- Why don't you stay with us?

700
01:05:58,082 --> 01:06:00,001
- Tonight we'll celebrate.
- Look at all this.

701
01:06:00,084 --> 01:06:03,004
I can't.
I got to get back to work.

702
01:06:03,087 --> 01:06:07,008
Tonight we'll celebrate.
Make sure Sophie gets back home safe.

703
01:06:07,091 --> 01:06:10,011
- Wear those clothes tonight.
- Look at these shoes!

704
01:06:10,094 --> 01:06:12,013
Tonight.
Tonight Ill look at it.

705
01:06:13,097 --> 01:06:16,017
Oh, my darling.
I'm so proud of you.

706
01:06:20,104 --> 01:06:21,022
Tonight!

707
01:06:22,106 --> 01:06:26,027
You were the one who gave
me the idea to get it.

708
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:30,031
- I think it's like mine.
- It's a beautiful watch, yes?

709
01:06:32,116 --> 01:06:35,036
Dr. Kats, my boss, and his wife...

710
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:40,041
Her family is in the jewellery
business, so he took me there...

711
01:06:40,124 --> 01:06:43,044
- to get it engraved.
- It opens at the top, like mine.

712
01:06:43,127 --> 01:06:45,046
What? Don't get you fingers...

713
01:06:45,129 --> 01:06:48,049
- You got your fingerprints all over it.
- Nathan won't know.

714
01:06:48,132 --> 01:06:51,052
- Anyway, do you think he will like it?
- Sure, he will.

715
01:06:51,135 --> 01:06:54,055
I think he'll be very pleased.

716
01:06:55,139 --> 01:06:58,059
It... you know, it cost...

717
01:06:58,142 --> 01:07:02,063
a great deal of money.
More than I could afford.

718
01:07:02,146 --> 01:07:04,065
Anyway, who cares?

719
01:07:04,148 --> 01:07:07,068
Today, money doesn't
seem very important.

720
01:07:08,152 --> 01:07:10,071
Get the champagne!
