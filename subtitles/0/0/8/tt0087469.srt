1
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:49,639
Anything goes

2
00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:59,661
Anything goes

3
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:20,613
Anything goes

4
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:42,318
Anything goes

5
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:02,605
Be careful.

6
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:20,049
You never told me you spoke
my language, Dr.Jones.

7
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:22,933
Only on special occasions.

8
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:25,900
So, it is true?

9
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:27,829
You found Nurhachi?

10
00:03:27,894 --> 00:03:29,301
You know I did.

11
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:32,814
Last night one of your boys
tried to get Nurhachi

12
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,838
without paying for him.

13
00:03:34,902 --> 00:03:36,309
You have insulted my son.

14
00:03:36,374 --> 00:03:38,382
No, you have insulted me.

15
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:40,755
I spared his life.

16
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:43,440
Aren't you going
to introduce us?

17
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:48,588
This is Willie Scott.

18
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:53,235
This is Indiana Jones,
famous archaeologist.

19
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:56,085
Well, I thought archaeologists
were always funny little men

20
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:58,672
searching for their mommies.

21
00:03:58,743 --> 00:03:59,920
Mummies.

22
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:02,512
Dr.Jones found Nurhachi for me,

23
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:05,005
and he's going to deliver him...

24
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,094
now.

25
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:08,977
Say, who is the Nurhac...

26
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:10,192
...hachi?!

27
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:11,987
Put the gun away, sonny.

28
00:04:15,704 --> 00:04:18,322
I suggest you give me
what you owe me

29
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,602
or anything goes.

30
00:04:19,672 --> 00:04:20,566
Ooh.

31
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:31,188
Open it.

32
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:38,872
The diamond, Lao.

33
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:41,490
The deal was for the diamond.

34
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:05,493
Oh, Lao...

35
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:07,023
Ow!

36
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:10,614
To your very good health.

37
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:11,990
Lao!

38
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:12,985
He put a hole...

39
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,279
he put two holes in my dress
from Paris!

40
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:17,589
Sit down!

41
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,265
Now, you bring me Nurhachi.

42
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:26,712
My pleasure.

43
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:30,324
Who on Earth is this Nurhachi?

44
00:05:33,563 --> 00:05:34,992
Here he is.

45
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:41,657
This Nurhachi's
a real small guy.

46
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:47,986
Inside are the remains
of Nurhachi...

47
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:52,053
first Emperor of Manchu Dynasty.

48
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:55,254
Welcome home, old boy.

49
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:07,185
And now, you give me
the diamond.

50
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,748
Are you trying to develop
a sense of humor,

51
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,707
or am I going deaf?

52
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:18,164
What's that?

53
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:20,092
Antidote.

54
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:22,044
To what?

55
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:25,687
The poison you just drank,
Dr.Jones.

56
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:32,883
The poison works fast,
Dr.Jones.

57
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:42,714
- Lao.
- Lao!

58
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:44,570
You keep the girl.

59
00:06:44,702 --> 00:06:45,781
I find another.

60
00:06:48,894 --> 00:06:50,934
Good service here.

61
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:52,216
That's not a waiter.

62
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,457
Wu Han's an old friend.

63
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:56,435
Game's not over, Lao.

64
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,168
Antidote.

65
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,598
Indy...

66
00:07:17,118 --> 00:07:19,453
Don't worry, Wu Han,
I'll get you out of here.

67
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,592
Not this time, Indy.

68
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:25,274
I followed you
on many adventures...

69
00:07:25,342 --> 00:07:27,612
but into the great
unknown mystery...

70
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,566
I go first, Indy.

71
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:35,833
Don't be sad, Dr.Jones.

72
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:38,107
You will soon be joining him.

73
00:07:43,104 --> 00:07:46,268
Too much to drink, Dr.Jones?

74
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:37,182
Oh, nuts!

75
00:08:42,753 --> 00:08:43,801
Oh!

76
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,578
The antidote.

77
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,697
Where's the diamond?

78
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:18,969
No!

79
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:24,224
Stay there!

80
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:05,402
Come on.

81
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:09,380
I don't want to die!

82
00:10:19,654 --> 00:10:21,629
Who are you?

83
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:27,461
Wow! Holy smoke!

84
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,533
Crash landing!

85
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:32,454
Short Round, step on it.

86
00:10:32,518 --> 00:10:33,925
Okey-dokey, Dr.Jones.

87
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,681
Hold on to your potatoes.

88
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,757
For crying out loud,
there's a kid driving the car!

89
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,729
Wow!

90
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,846
Wow.

91
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:59,005
Where's the antidote?
Let me have it.

92
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:00,704
Listen, I just met you,
for Christ's sakes.

93
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:02,150
Give me...

94
00:11:02,215 --> 00:11:03,459
Oh, I'm not that kind of girl.

95
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:05,916
Hey, Dr.Jones,
no time for love.

96
00:11:05,992 --> 00:11:07,421
We got company.

97
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,503
Oh, I hope you choke.

98
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,240
No shooting.

99
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:35,431
Okay, you asked for it.

100
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:56,903
This is fun!

101
00:11:58,378 --> 00:12:00,352
Here, hold this.

102
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:06,728
Where's my gun?

103
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:07,841
Where's my gun?!

104
00:12:07,914 --> 00:12:11,078
I burnt my fingers,
and I cracked a nail!

105
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,279
Ah, Dr.Jones...

106
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:22,248
I'm Art Weber.

107
00:12:22,314 --> 00:12:23,743
I spoke with your assistant.

108
00:12:23,818 --> 00:12:25,673
Uh, we've managed
to secure three seats,

109
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:27,745
but there might be
a slight inconvenience

110
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:30,982
as you will be riding
on a cargo full of live poultry.

111
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,163
Is he kidding?

112
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:35,202
Madam, it's the best I could do
on such short notice.

113
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:36,769
Heavens, aren't you
Willie Scott,

114
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:38,818
the famous American
female vocalist?

115
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:42,211
Owe you a gin.

116
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:52,900
Nice try, Lao Che.

117
00:12:57,004 --> 00:12:59,208
Good-bye, Dr.Jones.

118
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:38,727
So, what are you supposed to be,
a lion tamer?

119
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:41,099
I'm allowing you to tag along,

120
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,362
so why don't you give
your mouth a rest?

121
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:46,437
Okay, doll?

122
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,233
What do you mean, "tag along"?

123
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:50,090
Ever since
you got into my club,

124
00:13:50,158 --> 00:13:52,013
you haven't been able
to take your eyes off me.

125
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:53,900
Oh, yeah?

126
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:27,207
Oh, no...

127
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:28,655
Oh, no!

128
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:30,412
Mister, mister...

129
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:31,976
Oh, mister, wake up.
Please, mister...

130
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:33,992
You call him Dr.Jones, doll!

131
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:35,920
Okay, Dr.Jones, Dr.Jones.

132
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:37,415
Oh, wake up, please!

133
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:38,537
Are we there already?

134
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,503
Oh, good.

135
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,497
No.

136
00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:41,490
Huh?

137
00:15:43,218 --> 00:15:44,974
No one's flying the plane!

138
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,089
Oh, boy...

139
00:15:47,602 --> 00:15:48,812
They've all gone!

140
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:54,571
You know how to fly,
don't you?

141
00:15:54,642 --> 00:15:56,715
No. Do you?

142
00:15:56,786 --> 00:15:57,680
Oh, no.

143
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:59,153
- Oh, my God!
- How hard can it be?

144
00:15:59,218 --> 00:16:00,167
- I'm gonna faint.
- Altimeter!

145
00:16:00,243 --> 00:16:01,388
Okay.

146
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:02,636
Air speed.

147
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:03,754
Uh, okay.

148
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:04,720
Fuel...

149
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:06,578
Fuel?

150
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:08,619
Fuel?!

151
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:24,110
I think we got a big problem.

152
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:25,586
Dr.Jones!
Shorty!

153
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,466
Dr.Jones!
No more parachutes!

154
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:31,378
- Oh...
- Shorty!

155
00:16:31,444 --> 00:16:32,655
- Come on, give me a hand!
- What's that?

156
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:34,098
Move the box!

157
00:16:34,164 --> 00:16:35,920
Dr.Jones, you're crazy!

158
00:16:40,468 --> 00:16:42,029
Shorty, get our stuff!

159
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:47,433
A boat?

160
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:49,614
We're not sinking.

161
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:50,633
We're crashing!

162
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:53,587
Grab on, Shorty!

163
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:54,546
Grab on!

164
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,271
- Lady, I can't breathe!
- Tight!

165
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:35,696
Slow it down!

166
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:38,704
That wasn't so bad, was it?

167
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:54,998
Aah! Put on the brakes!

168
00:17:57,848 --> 00:18:02,038
I hate the water,
and I hate being wet,

169
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:03,118
and I hate you!

170
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:04,785
Good.

171
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:06,132
Good!

172
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,499
Dr.Jones?

173
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:34,292
I'm all right, Shorty.

174
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:35,635
You okay?

175
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:46,670
Oh, where are we, anyway?

176
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:52,401
India.

177
00:18:52,473 --> 00:18:53,902
How do you know that?

178
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,675
Oh, I sure hope
this means dinner.

179
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:44,821
God, I'm starving.

180
00:20:45,982 --> 00:20:47,225
Thank you.

181
00:20:54,526 --> 00:20:55,638
I can't eat this.

182
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,572
That's more food than these
people eat in a week.

183
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:01,620
They're starving.

184
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,931
Oh, I'm sorry.
You can have...

185
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:06,169
Eat it.

186
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:08,828
I'm not hungry.

187
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,446
You're insulting them,

188
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:14,780
and you're embarrassing me.

189
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:17,149
Eat it.
Eat it.

190
00:21:17,215 --> 00:21:18,524
Eat.

191
00:21:32,063 --> 00:21:33,590
Bad news coming.

192
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:38,328
Can you provide us with a guide
to take us to Delhi?

193
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,294
I'm a professor.

194
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,302
I have to get back
to my university.

195
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:43,547
Yes. Sajnu will guide you.

196
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:51,162
On the way to Delhi,
you will stop at Pankot.

197
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,232
Pankot is not
on the way to Delhi.

198
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,476
You will go to Pankot Palace.

199
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:58,170
I thought the palace
had been deserted

200
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,833
since, uh... the 1850s.

201
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:02,457
No. Now there is
a new maharaja,

202
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:07,351
and again the palace
has the power of the Dark Light.

203
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:11,254
It is that place
kill my people.

204
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,856
What has happened here?

205
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:15,711
The evil start in Pankot...

206
00:22:15,777 --> 00:22:19,672
then like monsoon...

207
00:22:19,745 --> 00:22:24,185
it moves darkness...

208
00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:27,257
over all country...

209
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:29,751
over all country.

210
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:31,549
The evil?

211
00:22:34,497 --> 00:22:35,545
What evil?

212
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:36,992
See? Bad news.

213
00:22:37,058 --> 00:22:39,392
You listen to Suwamu.
You leave Lanka.

214
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,313
Shh...

215
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:46,304
They came from palace...

216
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,988
and took Sivalinga...

217
00:22:49,058 --> 00:22:51,229
from our village.

218
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:52,673
Took what?

219
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:53,883
It's a stone--

220
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:56,442
a sacred stone from the shrine
that protects the village.

221
00:22:56,515 --> 00:22:59,198
It is why Siva brought you here.

222
00:23:08,675 --> 00:23:10,530
We weren't brought here.

223
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:12,765
Our plane crashed.

224
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:14,494
It crashed.

225
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:16,799
No, no.

226
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:21,756
We prayed to Siva
to help us find the stone.

227
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:23,770
It was Siva

228
00:23:23,844 --> 00:23:28,765
who made you fall
from the sky.

229
00:23:28,836 --> 00:23:36,289
So you will go to Pankot Palace
to find Sivilinga and bring back

230
00:23:36,356 --> 00:23:37,730
to us.

231
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:42,052
Bring back to us.
Bring back to us.

232
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:44,255
Bring back to us.

233
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:47,193
Dr.Jones, did they
make the plane crash

234
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:49,505
to get you here?

235
00:23:49,573 --> 00:23:51,100
No, Shorty,
it's just a ghost story.

236
00:23:51,173 --> 00:23:52,634
Don't worry about it.

237
00:23:57,253 --> 00:23:59,937
They took the stone from here.

238
00:24:03,781 --> 00:24:07,937
Was the stone very smooth
like a rock from a sacred river?

239
00:24:08,005 --> 00:24:09,249
Yes.

240
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:10,397
With three lines across it

241
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:12,324
representing the three levels
of the universe.

242
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:14,080
That's right.
Yes.

243
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:16,866
I've seen stones
like the one you lost.

244
00:24:16,934 --> 00:24:20,796
But why would Maharaja
take the sacred stone from here?

245
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,125
They says we must pray
to their evil god.

246
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,638
We says we will not.

247
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,790
Excuse me,

248
00:24:29,862 --> 00:24:32,382
I don't understand how one rock
could destroy a whole village.

249
00:24:36,774 --> 00:24:39,108
He's saying when
the sacred stone was taken,

250
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:40,189
the village wells dried up,

251
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:41,691
and the river turned to sand.

252
00:24:46,215 --> 00:24:48,070
The crops were swallowed
by the earth,

253
00:24:48,135 --> 00:24:51,518
and the animals laid down
and turned to dust.

254
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:54,820
Then one night there
was a fire in the fields.

255
00:24:54,887 --> 00:24:58,051
The men went out
to fight the fire.

256
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:01,218
When they came back, the women
were crying in the darkness.

257
00:25:11,495 --> 00:25:13,983
Children.

258
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:16,958
He says
they stole their children.

259
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:06,630
Sankara! Sankara...

260
00:26:09,738 --> 00:26:11,713
Ranjit!

261
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:13,890
Ranjit!

262
00:26:38,827 --> 00:26:40,715
Sankara.

263
00:26:54,956 --> 00:26:59,593
Little boy escaped
from the evil palace.

264
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,246
Many other children
still there.

265
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:05,447
What we do, Dr.Jones?

266
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:14,372
What you think?

267
00:27:14,444 --> 00:27:16,517
I think that somebody believes

268
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:19,240
the good luck rock
from this village

269
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:21,731
is one of the lost
Sankara stones.

270
00:27:21,804 --> 00:27:24,455
What is Sankara?

271
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:26,598
Fortune and glory, kid.

272
00:27:27,949 --> 00:27:30,186
Fortune and glory.

273
00:27:52,686 --> 00:27:55,588
Willie, quit monkeying around
on that thing.

274
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,310
Oh, wait a second! Indy!

275
00:28:06,382 --> 00:28:08,619
I can't go to Delhi like this!

276
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,149
We're not going to Delhi, doll.

277
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:12,459
We're going to Pankot Palace.

278
00:28:12,527 --> 00:28:14,469
Pankot?!

279
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:16,583
I can't go to Pankot!
I'm a singer.

280
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,117
Oh, I need to call my agent.

281
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,173
Is there a phone?

282
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:20,654
Anybody, I need a phone!

283
00:28:54,865 --> 00:28:55,879
Eww!

284
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:12,364
Oh, quit complaining.
This is expensive stuff.

285
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:16,492
You come to America with me,
and we get job in circus.

286
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:18,416
You like that?
You like America?

287
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:20,107
You're my best friend.

288
00:29:20,178 --> 00:29:22,218
You're my best friend.

289
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:25,585
Ooh, what big birds!

290
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:28,845
Those aren't big
birds, sweetheart.

291
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:31,761
They're giant vampire bats.

292
00:29:31,826 --> 00:29:33,167
Bats?

293
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,080
Oh, pipe down, you big baboon.
This doesn't hurt.

294
00:29:44,146 --> 00:29:45,488
You know what you really need?

295
00:29:45,554 --> 00:29:47,725
You really need a bath.

296
00:29:56,915 --> 00:29:59,054
Ha-ha, very funny.

297
00:29:59,123 --> 00:30:00,432
Very funny.

298
00:30:01,747 --> 00:30:03,176
Very funny.

299
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:05,160
All wet.

300
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:08,847
I was happy in Shanghai.

301
00:30:08,915 --> 00:30:12,428
I had a little house...
and a garden.

302
00:30:13,684 --> 00:30:14,698
My friends were rich.

303
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,870
We went to parties
all the time in limousines.

304
00:30:17,939 --> 00:30:20,459
I hate being outside!

305
00:30:22,068 --> 00:30:23,529
I'm a singer!

306
00:30:23,603 --> 00:30:25,970
I could lose my voice!

307
00:30:27,348 --> 00:30:29,803
I think
we'll camp here tonight.

308
00:30:31,188 --> 00:30:32,268
Cut it out.

309
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:39,755
What do you got?

310
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:40,777
Two sixes.

311
00:30:40,852 --> 00:30:42,096
Aha-ha, three aces.

312
00:30:42,164 --> 00:30:43,212
I win.

313
00:30:43,285 --> 00:30:45,139
Two more game,
I have all your money.

314
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:46,285
Ha, ha, ha!

315
00:30:47,797 --> 00:30:50,547
It's poker, Shorty,
anything can happen.

316
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:53,428
Where did you find your,
uh, little bodyguard?

317
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:55,882
I didn't find him,
I caught him.

318
00:30:55,957 --> 00:30:57,102
What?

319
00:30:57,173 --> 00:30:58,351
Shorty's family were killed

320
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:00,112
when the Japanese
bombed Shanghai.

321
00:31:00,181 --> 00:31:02,319
He's been living on the streets
since he was four.

322
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:05,553
I caught him trying to pick my
pocket, didn't l, short stuff?

323
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:11,185
Biggest trouble with her
is the noise.

324
00:31:18,806 --> 00:31:20,661
Hey! You cheat, Dr.Jones.

325
00:31:20,726 --> 00:31:21,773
You cheat!

326
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,340
What do you mean?
You take four card.

327
00:31:25,782 --> 00:31:27,157
- You pay now.
- Oh, they were stuck together.

328
00:31:27,222 --> 00:31:28,116
No stuck. No mistake.

329
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:29,426
They were stuck together.
It's a mistake.

330
00:31:29,494 --> 00:31:31,469
I'm very little.
You cheat very big.

331
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:34,449
Dr.Jones, you cheat!

332
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,275
You pay money.
You owe me ten cent.

333
00:31:36,343 --> 00:31:38,896
Look at this.
Look at this.

334
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:42,933
You accuse me of cheating.

335
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:44,755
You're cheating.

336
00:31:50,103 --> 00:31:51,280
You make me poor.

337
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:52,595
No fun.

338
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:53,874
Play with you no fun.

339
00:31:53,943 --> 00:31:56,877
- I quit.
- I quit, too.

340
00:31:56,951 --> 00:31:59,090
Oh, this place is
completely surrounded.

341
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:01,264
The entire place is crawling
with living things.

342
00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:03,310
That's why they call it
the jungle, sweetheart.

343
00:32:03,384 --> 00:32:04,726
Oh, my God,
what else is out there?

344
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:05,719
Willie, wait...

345
00:32:05,848 --> 00:32:06,895
Oh!

346
00:32:11,032 --> 00:32:13,006
Willie, Willie...

347
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,062
What is that?

348
00:32:14,136 --> 00:32:16,275
Is that short for something?

349
00:32:16,408 --> 00:32:19,823
"Willie" is my
professional name, Indiana.

350
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,547
Hey, lady,
you call him Dr.Jones.

351
00:32:22,616 --> 00:32:25,137
My professional name.

352
00:32:26,296 --> 00:32:28,751
Why are you dragging us off
to this deserted palace?

353
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:30,231
Fortune and glory?

354
00:32:30,297 --> 00:32:31,671
Fortune and glory.

355
00:32:33,145 --> 00:32:37,204
Well... this is a piece
of an old manuscript.

356
00:32:37,273 --> 00:32:39,891
This pictograph
represents Sankara,

357
00:32:39,961 --> 00:32:41,172
a priest.

358
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:43,095
Scram.

359
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,535
Gentle. Gentle.

360
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:45,976
This is hundreds of years old.

361
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:47,535
Is that some kind of writing?

362
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:49,332
Yeah, it's Sanskrit.

363
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:50,350
Cut it out.

364
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,881
It's part
of the legend of Sankara.

365
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:53,936
He climbs Mount Kalisa

366
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,668
where he meets Siva,
the Hindu god.

367
00:32:55,738 --> 00:32:57,265
That's Siva?

368
00:32:57,338 --> 00:32:59,312
And what's he handing
the priest?

369
00:32:59,385 --> 00:33:01,044
Rocks.

370
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:02,291
Stop.

371
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:04,817
He told him to go
forth and combat evil.

372
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,002
And to help him, he gave him

373
00:33:06,074 --> 00:33:09,009
five sacred stones
with magical properties.

374
00:33:09,146 --> 00:33:10,706
Magic rocks?

375
00:33:10,778 --> 00:33:12,240
My grandpa was a magician.

376
00:33:12,314 --> 00:33:14,386
He spent his entire life
with a rabbit in his pocket

377
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:15,735
and pigeons up his sleeves.

378
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:18,769
He made a lot of children happy
and died a very poor man.

379
00:33:18,842 --> 00:33:21,592
Magic rocks.
Fortune and glory.

380
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,252
Sweet dreams, Dr.Jones.

381
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:25,906
Where are you going?

382
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:29,110
I'd sleep closer, if I were you.

383
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:30,805
For safety's sake.

384
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:34,420
Dr.Jones, I'd be safer
sleeping with a snake.

385
00:33:35,643 --> 00:33:38,578
I said, cut it out!

386
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,238
I hate that elephant.

387
00:34:11,452 --> 00:34:12,947
Indy, look!

388
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,508
I see it, Shorty.

389
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,450
That's it: Pankot Palace.

390
00:35:32,352 --> 00:35:34,937
Dr.Jones, what you look at?

391
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,724
Don't come up here.

392
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:45,143
No! No, no, no, no!

393
00:35:45,216 --> 00:35:46,393
Don't leave! No!

394
00:35:46,464 --> 00:35:48,188
No, no, no, no, no!

395
00:35:48,256 --> 00:35:50,744
Oh, baby elephant, stay here!

396
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:52,475
Oh, no! Indy!

397
00:35:52,544 --> 00:35:54,748
They're stealing our rides!

398
00:35:54,816 --> 00:35:57,751
We walk from here.

399
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,370
Hello.

400
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:36,257
I should say
you look rather lost.

401
00:36:36,322 --> 00:36:37,696
But then I cannot imagine

402
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:40,893
where in the world the three
of you would look at home.

403
00:36:40,962 --> 00:36:41,856
We're not lost.

404
00:36:41,922 --> 00:36:43,515
We're on our way to Delhi.

405
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:45,310
This is Miss Scott.

406
00:36:45,379 --> 00:36:47,419
This is Mr.Round.

407
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,920
Short Round.

408
00:36:48,994 --> 00:36:50,489
My name is Indiana Jones.

409
00:36:50,562 --> 00:36:53,978
Dr.Jones, the eminent
archaeologist?

410
00:36:54,051 --> 00:36:55,577
Hard to believe, isn't it?

411
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,544
Ah.

412
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,399
I remember first
hearing your name

413
00:36:58,467 --> 00:36:59,744
when I was up at Oxford.

414
00:36:59,811 --> 00:37:00,705
Oh.

415
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:02,593
I'm Chattar Lal, Prime Minister

416
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:05,245
to His Highness,
the Maharaja of Pankot.

417
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:07,038
I'm enchanted.

418
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:08,962
Enchanted.
Thank you very much.

419
00:37:09,028 --> 00:37:10,238
Thank you very much.

420
00:37:10,307 --> 00:37:12,347
Welcome to Pankot Palace!

421
00:37:14,915 --> 00:37:16,704
Enchanted, huh?

422
00:37:28,036 --> 00:37:30,850
Shorty, where's my razor?

423
00:37:54,213 --> 00:37:55,587
We are fortunate tonight

424
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:58,239
to have so many
unexpected visitors.

425
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,454
This is Captain...

426
00:37:59,525 --> 00:38:01,729
...Blumburtt.
11th Poona Rifles.

427
00:38:01,797 --> 00:38:04,644
And you, sir, are
Dr.Jones, I presume.

428
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,303
I am, Captain.

429
00:38:06,374 --> 00:38:07,934
Captain Blumburtt and his troops

430
00:38:08,005 --> 00:38:09,663
are on a routine
inspection tour.

431
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:11,108
The British find it amusing

432
00:38:11,174 --> 00:38:13,029
to inspect us
at their convenience.

433
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:14,304
I do hope, sir,

434
00:38:14,373 --> 00:38:18,018
that it's not, uh,
inconvenient to you, uh... sir.

435
00:38:18,086 --> 00:38:21,664
The British worry so
about their empire.

436
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:24,582
Makes us all feel like
well-cared-for children.

437
00:38:33,095 --> 00:38:34,305
Ah...

438
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:36,579
you look beautiful.

439
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,102
I think the maharaja
is swimming in loot.

440
00:38:39,175 --> 00:38:42,306
Maybe it wasn't such a bad
idea coming here after all.

441
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:44,611
You look like a princess.

442
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:48,957
Mr.Lal, what do they call
the maharaja's wife?

443
00:38:49,032 --> 00:38:51,333
His Highness
has not yet taken a wife.

444
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,926
How interesting.

445
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:55,934
Well, uh, maybe it's because
he hasn't found the right woman.

446
00:39:08,648 --> 00:39:11,582
His Supreme Highness,

447
00:39:11,656 --> 00:39:15,748
guardian of Pankot tradition,

448
00:39:15,816 --> 00:39:18,947
the Maharaja of Pankot,

449
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:21,569
Zalim Singh.

450
00:39:41,193 --> 00:39:44,160
That's the maharaja?

451
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:45,760
A kid?!

452
00:39:47,946 --> 00:39:51,077
Maybe he like older women.

453
00:39:58,474 --> 00:40:00,230
Captain Blumburtt
was just telling me

454
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:02,818
something of the interesting
history of the palace--

455
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,778
the importance it played
in the mutiny.

456
00:40:04,842 --> 00:40:09,315
It seems the British never
forget the Mutiny of 1857.

457
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,962
Yes, well, you know, I think
there are other events--

458
00:40:13,066 --> 00:40:14,888
before the mutiny,
going back a century,

459
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:17,604
back to the time of Clive--
that are more interesting.

460
00:40:17,674 --> 00:40:20,358
And what events are those,
Dr.Jones?

461
00:40:20,427 --> 00:40:22,183
Well, if memory
serves me correctly,

462
00:40:22,251 --> 00:40:23,625
this area, this province,

463
00:40:23,691 --> 00:40:25,829
was the center of activity
for the Thuggee.

464
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:27,622
Ah!

465
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:31,139
Snake... Surprise.

466
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:32,933
What's the surprise?

467
00:40:42,027 --> 00:40:44,962
Dr.Jones,
you know perfectly well

468
00:40:45,036 --> 00:40:47,883
the Thuggee cult has been dead
for nearly a century.

469
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:48,962
Yes, of course.

470
00:40:49,036 --> 00:40:52,811
The Thuggee was an obscenity
that worshipped Kali

471
00:40:52,876 --> 00:40:54,338
with human sacrifices.

472
00:40:54,412 --> 00:40:57,511
The British Army
nicely did away with them.

473
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:03,975
Well, I suppose stories
of the Thuggee die hard.

474
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,313
There are no stories anymore.

475
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,453
I'm not so sure.

476
00:41:08,525 --> 00:41:10,499
We came from a small village.

477
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:12,327
The peasants there told us

478
00:41:12,396 --> 00:41:15,015
Pankot Palace
was growing powerful again

479
00:41:15,085 --> 00:41:17,027
because of some ancient evil.

480
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:19,075
Village stories, Dr.Jones.

481
00:41:19,149 --> 00:41:22,761
They're just fear and folklore.

482
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:25,993
You're beginning to worry
Captain Blumburtt.

483
00:41:26,061 --> 00:41:29,542
I'm not worried,
Mr. Prime Minister, just, uh...

484
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:32,002
just, um, interested.

485
00:41:34,477 --> 00:41:35,459
Ah...

486
00:41:46,862 --> 00:41:49,677
What? You are not eating?

487
00:41:49,742 --> 00:41:53,320
I had bugs for lunch.

488
00:41:56,591 --> 00:41:58,379
Give me your hat.

489
00:41:59,663 --> 00:42:01,124
Why?

490
00:42:01,198 --> 00:42:03,369
'Cause I'm gonna
puke in it. Oh!

491
00:42:05,327 --> 00:42:07,269
You know,
the villagers also told us

492
00:42:07,343 --> 00:42:09,198
Pankot Palace
had taken something.

493
00:42:09,263 --> 00:42:11,980
Dr.Jones, in our country,

494
00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:15,364
it's not usual for a guest
to insult his host.

495
00:42:15,439 --> 00:42:18,058
I'm sorry.

496
00:42:18,127 --> 00:42:20,461
I thought we were talking
about folklore.

497
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,894
Excuse me, sir, do you have
anything simple, like soup?

498
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:29,066
What exactly was it
they say was stolen?

499
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:31,437
A sacred rock.

500
00:42:33,072 --> 00:42:34,282
Ha!

501
00:42:34,352 --> 00:42:36,872
You see, Captain, a rock!

502
00:42:38,352 --> 00:42:40,174
Ah!

503
00:42:44,368 --> 00:42:45,513
Ah...

504
00:42:50,256 --> 00:42:53,420
Something connected--

505
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,343
the villagers' rock

506
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:58,572
and the old legend
of the Sankara Stones.

507
00:42:58,641 --> 00:43:02,438
Dr.Jones, we are all vulnerable
to vicious rumors.

508
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:04,422
I seem to remember
that in Honduras

509
00:43:04,497 --> 00:43:06,734
you were accused
of being a grave robber

510
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:08,427
rather than an archaeologist.

511
00:43:08,497 --> 00:43:11,792
Well, the newspapers greatly
exaggerated the incident.

512
00:43:11,857 --> 00:43:13,450
And wasn't it
the Sultan of Madagascar

513
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:14,983
who threatened
to cut your head off

514
00:43:15,058 --> 00:43:16,487
if you ever returned
to his country?

515
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:17,489
No, it wasn't my head.

516
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,797
Then your hands, perhaps.

517
00:43:18,865 --> 00:43:21,037
No, it wasn't my hands,

518
00:43:21,106 --> 00:43:22,960
it was my...

519
00:43:23,026 --> 00:43:24,400
my misunderstanding.

520
00:43:24,465 --> 00:43:26,505
Exactly what we have
here, Dr.Jones.

521
00:43:26,578 --> 00:43:30,473
I have heard the evil stories
of the Thuggee cult.

522
00:43:30,546 --> 00:43:33,841
I thought the stories were told
to frighten children.

523
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:36,973
Later, I learnt
the Thuggee cult was once real

524
00:43:37,043 --> 00:43:39,977
and did of unspeakable things.

525
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,793
I am ashamed of what happened
here so many years ago,

526
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:45,004
and I assure you

527
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:48,970
this will never happen again
in my kingdom.

528
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,359
If I offended you...

529
00:43:52,435 --> 00:43:54,802
then I am sorry.

530
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:05,579
Ah, dessert!

531
00:44:18,612 --> 00:44:21,362
Chilled monkey brains.

532
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:37,647
Uh, I think I'll
just check on Willie.

533
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:40,973
That's all you better do.

534
00:44:42,357 --> 00:44:44,626
Tell me later what happened.

535
00:44:44,693 --> 00:44:46,864
Am-scray.

536
00:44:55,061 --> 00:44:56,654
Ah.

537
00:44:56,726 --> 00:44:58,864
I've got something for you.

538
00:44:58,933 --> 00:45:02,381
There's nothing you have
that I could possibly want.

539
00:45:02,453 --> 00:45:04,755
Right.

540
00:45:10,134 --> 00:45:11,628
Oh.

541
00:45:11,702 --> 00:45:14,451
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

542
00:45:14,517 --> 00:45:16,427
Mmm.

543
00:45:16,502 --> 00:45:18,290
Oh, you're a very nice man.

544
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:20,878
Maybe you could be
my palace slave.

545
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,525
Wear your jewels to bed,
Princess?

546
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:35,446
Yeah.

547
00:45:35,511 --> 00:45:38,228
And nothing else.

548
00:45:38,295 --> 00:45:39,953
That shock you?

549
00:45:40,023 --> 00:45:41,998
Nothing shocks me.

550
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:44,460
I'm a scientist.

551
00:45:44,535 --> 00:45:48,080
So, as a scientist, you
do a lot of research?

552
00:45:48,151 --> 00:45:50,453
Always.

553
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:52,886
And what sort of research
would you do on me?

554
00:45:55,832 --> 00:45:57,741
Nocturnal activities.

555
00:45:57,815 --> 00:46:00,685
You mean like what sort of cream
I put on my face at night,

556
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,418
what position
I like to sleep in?

557
00:46:02,488 --> 00:46:03,895
Mating customs.

558
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,975
Love rituals?

559
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:07,535
Primitive sexual practices.

560
00:46:07,608 --> 00:46:09,616
So you're an authority
in that area?

561
00:46:09,688 --> 00:46:11,249
Years of fieldwork.

562
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,530
Oh.

563
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:22,962
I don't blame you
for being sore at me.

564
00:46:23,032 --> 00:46:26,229
I can be hard to handle.

565
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:28,152
I've had worse.

566
00:46:28,217 --> 00:46:31,152
But you'll never have better.

567
00:46:33,177 --> 00:46:35,032
I don't know.

568
00:46:35,097 --> 00:46:37,366
As a scientist, I don't want
to prejudice my experiment.

569
00:46:37,433 --> 00:46:39,888
I'll let you know
in the morning.

570
00:46:39,961 --> 00:46:42,678
Why, you conceited ape.

571
00:46:42,745 --> 00:46:45,647
I'm not that easy.

572
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:48,755
I'm not that easy, either.

573
00:46:48,826 --> 00:46:50,167
Trouble with you is, Willie,

574
00:46:50,233 --> 00:46:52,819
you're too used
to getting your own way.

575
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,778
And you're just
too proud to admit

576
00:46:54,873 --> 00:46:57,841
that you're crazy about me,
Dr.Jones.

577
00:46:57,914 --> 00:47:01,329
If you want me, Willie,
you know where you can find me.

578
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:02,831
Five minutes.

579
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:05,273
You'll be back over here
in five minutes.

580
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:06,800
I'll be asleep in five minutes.

581
00:47:06,874 --> 00:47:07,954
Five.

582
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:10,165
You know it, and I know it.

583
00:47:24,891 --> 00:47:26,800
Five minutes.

584
00:47:28,731 --> 00:47:30,487
Four and a half.

585
00:48:21,917 --> 00:48:23,063
"Palace slave."

586
00:48:24,253 --> 00:48:27,100
"Nocturnal activities."

587
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:29,304
I'm a "conceited ape"?

588
00:48:30,461 --> 00:48:32,087
"I'll tell you in the morning."

589
00:48:33,886 --> 00:48:35,511
I can't believe it.

590
00:48:35,614 --> 00:48:37,337
He's not coming.

591
00:48:37,406 --> 00:48:37,501
She's not coming.

592
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:39,389
She's not coming.

593
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,775
I can't believe I'm not going.

594
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:03,576
Indiana Jones!

595
00:49:03,647 --> 00:49:06,298
This is one night
you'll never forget!

596
00:49:06,367 --> 00:49:07,261
This is the night

597
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,302
I slipped right through
your fingers!

598
00:49:11,295 --> 00:49:12,724
Sleep tight...

599
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:14,294
and pleasant dreams!

600
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,673
I could have been
your greatest adventure.

601
00:49:29,824 --> 00:49:30,871
Dr.Jones, your whip!

602
00:49:51,872 --> 00:49:52,570
- Shorty...
- Huh?

603
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,688
turn off the switch.

604
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,184
Oh, Indy.

605
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:03,422
Oh, be gentle with me.

606
00:50:03,489 --> 00:50:04,601
Be gentle with me.

607
00:50:10,817 --> 00:50:12,475
But I'm here.

608
00:50:23,874 --> 00:50:24,822
There's nobody here.

609
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:27,713
No, I'm here.

610
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:31,290
Indy, you're acting
awfully strange.

611
00:50:55,426 --> 00:50:58,045
Hey, I'm right here.

612
00:51:09,731 --> 00:51:14,204
"Follow in the footsteps
of Siva."

613
00:51:14,275 --> 00:51:16,380
What does that mean?

614
00:51:18,436 --> 00:51:22,178
"Do not betray these truths."

615
00:51:22,244 --> 00:51:24,699
Shorty, go get our stuff.

616
00:51:52,453 --> 00:51:54,788
Stay behind me, Short Round.

617
00:51:54,853 --> 00:51:59,360
Step where I step,
and don't touch anything.

618
00:52:10,982 --> 00:52:12,607
I step where you step.

619
00:52:12,678 --> 00:52:15,329
I touch nothing.

620
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:17,406
Indy!

621
00:52:37,479 --> 00:52:39,868
I step on something.

622
00:52:39,943 --> 00:52:42,365
Yeah, there's something
on the ground.

623
00:52:42,439 --> 00:52:44,479
Feel like step
on fortune cookies.

624
00:52:45,959 --> 00:52:47,650
It's not fortune cookies.

625
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,108
Let me take a look.

626
00:53:04,584 --> 00:53:06,340
That's no cookies.

627
00:53:06,408 --> 00:53:07,717
It's all right.
I got him.

628
00:53:11,528 --> 00:53:11,997
Ow!

629
00:53:12,072 --> 00:53:13,599
Go. There, go.

630
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:53,056
Stop.

631
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,301
Look, just stand up
against the wall,

632
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:56,777
will you?

633
00:54:10,634 --> 00:54:12,576
You say to stand
against the wall!

634
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:13,828
I listen to what you say!

635
00:54:13,899 --> 00:54:14,597
Not my fault! Not my fault!

636
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:16,259
Willie, get down here!

637
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:18,021
We're in trouble!

638
00:54:18,091 --> 00:54:21,353
Willie!
Willie!

639
00:54:21,419 --> 00:54:23,841
Bet I get all dirty again.

640
00:54:23,915 --> 00:54:25,409
- Willie, get down here!
- Not my fault!

641
00:54:25,483 --> 00:54:26,497
We're in trouble!

642
00:54:26,571 --> 00:54:27,465
Trouble?

643
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:28,425
Trouble?

644
00:54:28,523 --> 00:54:29,832
What sort of...?

645
00:54:44,171 --> 00:54:46,113
This is serious!

646
00:54:46,188 --> 00:54:49,604
There are two dead people
down here!

647
00:54:49,675 --> 00:54:51,585
There're going to be
two dead people in here!

648
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,587
Hurry!

649
00:54:52,652 --> 00:54:54,824
I've almost had enough
of you two.

650
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:56,037
Willie!

651
00:54:56,108 --> 00:54:57,799
What's the rush?!

652
00:54:57,868 --> 00:54:59,078
It's a long story, Willie.

653
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:00,969
Hurry, or you don't get
to hear it.

654
00:55:02,156 --> 00:55:05,702
Ooh, God, what is this?

655
00:55:06,893 --> 00:55:08,965
Indy, what is this?

656
00:55:09,036 --> 00:55:10,116
I can't see a thing!

657
00:55:11,437 --> 00:55:13,030
Hurry!

658
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,173
All right!

659
00:55:15,244 --> 00:55:16,259
Oh, I broke a nail.

660
00:55:22,701 --> 00:55:27,273
Uh... Uh...

661
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:31,626
Willie, hurry!

662
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:33,636
They're in my hair!

663
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:35,368
Aw, shut up, Willie!

664
00:55:37,454 --> 00:55:38,152
Indy, let me in!

665
00:55:38,222 --> 00:55:39,051
No, let us out!

666
00:55:39,118 --> 00:55:40,230
Let me in!

667
00:55:40,302 --> 00:55:41,033
Let us out!

668
00:55:41,102 --> 00:55:41,963
Shut up!

669
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:44,102
I'm down here!
They're all over me!

670
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,469
There's got to be a fulcrum
release lever somewhere.

671
00:55:47,534 --> 00:55:48,482
What?!

672
00:55:48,558 --> 00:55:50,468
A handle that opens the door.

673
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:51,590
Go on!

674
00:55:51,663 --> 00:55:52,873
They're just,
just square holes!

675
00:55:52,942 --> 00:55:53,836
Go to the right hole.

676
00:55:53,902 --> 00:55:56,106
Hurry, Willie!

677
00:55:57,838 --> 00:55:58,951
Ooh...

678
00:56:03,023 --> 00:56:03,950
The other one!

679
00:56:04,015 --> 00:56:06,087
The other right.
Your other right!

680
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:07,020
The one on your right!

681
00:56:07,086 --> 00:56:08,264
Oh, there's slime inside!

682
00:56:08,335 --> 00:56:10,190
I can't do it.

683
00:56:10,255 --> 00:56:11,204
You can do it.

684
00:56:11,279 --> 00:56:12,261
Feel inside.

685
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:13,546
Okay.

686
00:56:16,399 --> 00:56:18,123
You feel inside!

687
00:56:18,192 --> 00:56:20,014
Do it now!

688
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,323
Okay!

689
00:56:24,912 --> 00:56:26,505
Ooh!

690
00:56:26,576 --> 00:56:28,583
Ew!

691
00:56:31,152 --> 00:56:35,462
Willie, we are going to die!

692
00:56:35,536 --> 00:56:37,259
It's soft.

693
00:56:39,473 --> 00:56:41,229
It's moving!

694
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,960
Got it!

695
00:57:04,177 --> 00:57:06,032
Get 'em off of me!
Get 'em off of me!

696
00:57:06,098 --> 00:57:07,308
They're all over me!

697
00:57:07,377 --> 00:57:08,806
Get 'em off me!

698
00:57:10,001 --> 00:57:11,211
Huh?

699
00:57:11,281 --> 00:57:12,623
No!

700
00:57:14,353 --> 00:57:16,492
It wasn't me! It's her!

701
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:17,390
Huh?!

702
00:57:17,458 --> 00:57:19,051
Come on!

703
00:57:19,122 --> 00:57:20,496
Go! Move!

704
00:57:20,561 --> 00:57:21,739
Come on, move!

705
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:23,534
Come on!

706
00:58:19,924 --> 00:58:22,478
It's a Thuggee ceremony.

707
00:58:22,548 --> 00:58:24,491
They're worshipping Kali.

708
00:58:32,341 --> 00:58:35,690
Have you ever seen anything
like this before?

709
00:58:35,765 --> 00:58:38,448
Nobody's seen this
for a hundred years.

710
01:00:08,728 --> 01:00:14,260
Kali Ma.
Kali Ma...

711
01:00:14,329 --> 01:00:16,271
Kali Ma!

712
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:53,175
He's still alive.

713
01:02:13,949 --> 01:02:16,469
Kali Ma.

714
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:19,705
Kali Ma...

715
01:03:14,111 --> 01:03:17,755
That's the rock they
took from the village.

716
01:03:17,824 --> 01:03:20,474
It's one of the Sankara Stones.

717
01:03:26,591 --> 01:03:28,021
Why they glow like that?

718
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:30,431
Shh, shh.

719
01:03:30,496 --> 01:03:31,870
The legend says

720
01:03:31,936 --> 01:03:33,343
when the rocks are
brought together,

721
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:36,376
the diamonds inside
them will glow.

722
01:03:36,448 --> 01:03:38,041
Diamonds?

723
01:03:38,112 --> 01:03:39,159
Diamonds.

724
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,377
- Diamonds!
- Shh.

725
01:03:40,448 --> 01:03:41,463
Diamonds.

726
01:03:57,217 --> 01:03:59,072
Hey, hey.

727
01:03:59,137 --> 01:04:01,755
Look, I want you two
to stay up here and keep quiet.

728
01:04:01,825 --> 01:04:03,386
Shorty, you keep an eye on her.

729
01:04:03,457 --> 01:04:04,668
Why, where are you going?

730
01:04:04,738 --> 01:04:05,632
Down there.

731
01:04:05,698 --> 01:04:06,745
Down there?!

732
01:04:06,817 --> 01:04:08,191
Are you crazy?!

733
01:04:08,258 --> 01:04:11,389
I'm not leaving here
without the stones.

734
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:12,505
You could get killed

735
01:04:12,577 --> 01:04:14,432
chasing after your damn
fortune and glory!

736
01:04:14,497 --> 01:04:16,156
Maybe.

737
01:04:16,226 --> 01:04:19,193
But not today.

738
01:05:31,396 --> 01:05:33,404
Be careful.

739
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,114
Where's he going?

740
01:06:44,712 --> 01:06:46,916
Let me go!

741
01:06:49,032 --> 01:06:52,774
Run, Willie! Run!

742
01:08:21,387 --> 01:08:23,078
Dr.Jones!

743
01:08:24,715 --> 01:08:26,373
I keep telling you,

744
01:08:26,443 --> 01:08:29,542
you listen me more,
you live longer.

745
01:08:29,675 --> 01:08:32,545
Please, let me die.

746
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,791
I pray to Siva,

747
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:38,341
"Let me die," but I do not.

748
01:08:38,412 --> 01:08:41,281
Now... now the evil
of Kali take me.

749
01:08:42,924 --> 01:08:44,102
How?

750
01:08:44,172 --> 01:08:47,019
They will make me drink
the blood of the Kali.

751
01:08:47,085 --> 01:08:49,223
Then I'll fall
into the black sleep

752
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:50,667
of the Kali Ma.

753
01:08:50,765 --> 01:08:51,910
What is that?

754
01:08:51,981 --> 01:08:54,282
We become like them.

755
01:08:55,981 --> 01:08:59,778
We'll be alive,
but like a nightmare.

756
01:08:59,853 --> 01:09:03,748
You drink blood,
you not wake up from nightmare.

757
01:09:14,509 --> 01:09:19,016
You were caught trying to steal
the Sankara Stones.

758
01:09:19,085 --> 01:09:21,955
There were five stones
in the beginning.

759
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:25,259
Over the centuries, they
were dispersed by wars,

760
01:09:25,326 --> 01:09:27,235
sold off by thieves like you.

761
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:29,318
Thieves like me, huh?

762
01:09:29,389 --> 01:09:30,283
Ha!

763
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:33,000
Still missing two.

764
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:36,038
A century ago, when the
British raided this temple

765
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:37,637
and butchered my people,

766
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:40,045
a loyal priest hid
the last two stones

767
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:41,637
down here in the catacombs.

768
01:09:41,711 --> 01:09:44,199
So that's what you've got
these slaves digging for, huh?

769
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:46,245
They're innocent children.

770
01:09:46,318 --> 01:09:49,002
They dig for the gems
to support our cause.

771
01:09:50,991 --> 01:09:55,595
They also search
for the last two stones.

772
01:09:55,662 --> 01:09:58,924
Soon we will have
all the five Sankara Stones,

773
01:09:58,991 --> 01:10:02,734
and the Thuggees will be
all powerful.

774
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:05,581
What a vivid imagination.

775
01:10:09,807 --> 01:10:11,662
You...

776
01:10:11,727 --> 01:10:13,996
don't believe me?

777
01:10:14,063 --> 01:10:18,122
You will, Dr.Jones.

778
01:10:18,192 --> 01:10:21,258
You will become...

779
01:10:21,327 --> 01:10:23,499
a true believer.

780
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:41,324
Hi.

781
01:11:04,945 --> 01:11:05,993
Dr.Jones!

782
01:11:06,065 --> 01:11:07,495
Don't drink-- it's bad!

783
01:11:07,569 --> 01:11:09,479
Don't drink!

784
01:11:09,554 --> 01:11:10,928
Spit it out!

785
01:11:43,379 --> 01:11:44,307
Dr.Jones...

786
01:12:02,804 --> 01:12:06,895
You dare not do that.

787
01:12:22,997 --> 01:12:25,201
Leave him alone, you bastards!

788
01:12:35,285 --> 01:12:37,521
The British in India
will be slaughtered.

789
01:12:37,589 --> 01:12:40,175
Then we will overrun
the Muslims.

790
01:12:40,245 --> 01:12:42,700
Then the Hebrew God will fall.

791
01:12:42,773 --> 01:12:44,267
And then the Christian God

792
01:12:44,341 --> 01:12:46,283
will be cast down and forgotten.

793
01:12:48,566 --> 01:12:51,501
Soon, Kali Ma
will rule the world.

794
01:12:57,334 --> 01:12:59,243
Dr.Jones...

795
01:14:37,817 --> 01:14:40,720
Kali Ma protects us.

796
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:43,733
We are her children.

797
01:14:43,802 --> 01:14:46,836
We pledge our devotion to her

798
01:14:46,906 --> 01:14:48,466
with an offering of flesh...

799
01:14:48,538 --> 01:14:50,578
What are you doing?!

800
01:14:52,603 --> 01:14:55,701
...and blood.

801
01:15:03,931 --> 01:15:09,266
Your friend has seen...
and she has heard.

802
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:13,430
Now she will not talk.

803
01:15:20,796 --> 01:15:22,868
I'm not going to have
anything nice to say

804
01:15:23,003 --> 01:15:24,662
about this place
when I get back.

805
01:15:24,732 --> 01:15:27,579
Indy! For God sakes, help me!

806
01:15:27,643 --> 01:15:30,426
Wh-What's the matter with you?

807
01:15:45,148 --> 01:15:47,570
No... no.

808
01:16:16,957 --> 01:16:18,518
Come.

809
01:16:21,086 --> 01:16:23,028
Come.

810
01:16:43,551 --> 01:16:45,241
Indiana...

811
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:52,571
Indiana... help us.

812
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,495
Please, snap out of it.

813
01:17:06,591 --> 01:17:09,494
You're not one of them.

814
01:17:11,712 --> 01:17:14,909
You're not one of them.

815
01:17:16,384 --> 01:17:19,199
Please come back to us.

816
01:17:19,264 --> 01:17:21,981
Don't leave me.

817
01:17:34,081 --> 01:17:36,448
No!

818
01:17:38,656 --> 01:17:41,078
What are you doing?!

819
01:17:41,153 --> 01:17:42,680
Are you mad?!

820
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:55,611
Oh...

821
01:18:55,684 --> 01:18:59,328
Oh, this can't be happening,
this can't be happening.

822
01:18:59,395 --> 01:19:02,395
Wake up, Willie, wake up.

823
01:19:32,165 --> 01:19:34,915
No! No! No!

824
01:19:45,477 --> 01:19:46,371
No!

825
01:19:46,437 --> 01:19:48,259
No, no, no!

826
01:19:48,326 --> 01:19:52,100
Wake up, Dr.Jones,
wake up!

827
01:19:55,238 --> 01:19:56,514
Dr.Jones!

828
01:20:10,438 --> 01:20:13,308
Indy, I love you.

829
01:20:14,246 --> 01:20:16,516
Wake up, Indy!

830
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:17,346
Wake up!

831
01:20:19,175 --> 01:20:20,964
You're my best friend!

832
01:20:21,031 --> 01:20:22,176
Wake up, Indy!

833
01:20:26,919 --> 01:20:29,308
Wait! Wait!

834
01:20:29,384 --> 01:20:32,384
He's mine!

835
01:20:34,632 --> 01:20:36,519
I'm all right, kid.

836
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:20,869
Mola Ram!

837
01:22:39,341 --> 01:22:41,031
Give me some slack!

838
01:22:59,245 --> 01:23:02,147
Willie, Willie, wake up!

839
01:23:04,397 --> 01:23:06,667
Willie, Willie, it's me!
I'm back!

840
01:23:09,133 --> 01:23:11,075
Oh, Indy.

841
01:23:37,295 --> 01:23:40,710
Indy... my friend.

842
01:23:40,783 --> 01:23:43,816
I'm sorry, kid.

843
01:23:48,718 --> 01:23:49,798
Indy...

844
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:52,937
now, let's get out of here.

845
01:23:53,007 --> 01:23:57,263
Right. All of us.

846
01:25:07,314 --> 01:25:07,881
No!

847
01:25:24,659 --> 01:25:25,739
I've got to save him!

848
01:25:25,811 --> 01:25:27,240
He can take care of himself.

849
01:25:27,314 --> 01:25:28,208
He needs me.

850
01:25:30,355 --> 01:25:31,948
I've got to save Indy!

851
01:25:43,795 --> 01:25:45,202
Okay, save him.

852
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:50,736
Drop him down!

853
01:25:50,803 --> 01:25:52,210
I kill you!

854
01:25:52,275 --> 01:25:54,796
Drop him down!

855
01:25:57,523 --> 01:25:58,800
Whoa!

856
01:26:23,092 --> 01:26:24,587
What's the matter with him?

857
01:27:06,006 --> 01:27:07,894
Here. Try this.

858
01:28:19,929 --> 01:28:21,522
Go, Indy!

859
01:29:21,372 --> 01:29:23,706
It was the Black Sleep of Kali.

860
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:37,329
Short Round!

861
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:40,056
Quit fooling around
with that kid!

862
01:29:40,124 --> 01:29:41,531
Get down in the cart, now!

863
01:29:41,597 --> 01:29:43,190
Okey-dokey, Indy!

864
01:29:43,261 --> 01:29:44,341
Please listen.

865
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:46,420
To get out,
you must take the left tunnel.

866
01:29:46,493 --> 01:29:47,638
Thank you.

867
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:34,332
Shorty!

868
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:35,326
Quit stalling!

869
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:37,459
Come on, Indy!

870
01:30:37,535 --> 01:30:38,647
Go!

871
01:30:38,718 --> 01:30:40,213
Go! Go!

872
01:30:43,006 --> 01:30:44,217
Shorty, look out!

873
01:30:53,631 --> 01:30:55,093
- Come on!
- Indy!

874
01:30:59,775 --> 01:31:00,604
Hurry!

875
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,774
Hurry!

876
01:31:06,848 --> 01:31:07,644
Hurry up!

877
01:31:13,056 --> 01:31:14,583
Indy, take the left tunnel!

878
01:31:14,656 --> 01:31:16,063
The left tunnel!

879
01:31:16,128 --> 01:31:17,338
No, Indy!

880
01:31:17,408 --> 01:31:19,099
You missed it!
Left tunnel!

881
01:31:46,914 --> 01:31:50,427
We got company!

882
01:31:54,497 --> 01:31:55,391
Stop.

883
01:31:55,457 --> 01:31:56,188
Let her go!

884
01:31:56,258 --> 01:31:57,949
- Let go of the brake.
- What?

885
01:31:58,018 --> 01:31:59,065
What?

886
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:01,309
Let her go. Our only chance
is to outrun them.

887
01:32:17,666 --> 01:32:18,714
- Shorty?
- Huh?

888
01:32:18,787 --> 01:32:20,313
Come up here
and take the brake.

889
01:32:21,475 --> 01:32:22,522
Watch it on the curves,

890
01:32:22,594 --> 01:32:24,121
or we'll fly
right off the track.

891
01:32:24,195 --> 01:32:25,504
Okay.

892
01:33:19,173 --> 01:33:20,766
Yay!

893
01:33:43,430 --> 01:33:44,477
What are you doing?

894
01:33:44,549 --> 01:33:45,629
Short cut.

895
01:33:45,702 --> 01:33:47,164
- Yes, Indy.
- Short, cut.

896
01:34:10,151 --> 01:34:12,606
Watch it!

897
01:34:15,719 --> 01:34:16,897
Indy, help!

898
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:21,565
- Hang on!
- Indy!

899
01:34:22,439 --> 01:34:23,367
Pull him in.

900
01:34:23,431 --> 01:34:24,860
Let me go!
Let me go!

901
01:34:26,087 --> 01:34:27,265
Let go of him!

902
01:34:28,456 --> 01:34:30,147
No! No!

903
01:34:30,216 --> 01:34:31,972
Pull him in!

904
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:33,087
- I'll catch him!
- No!

905
01:35:17,897 --> 01:35:18,758
Duck!

906
01:35:37,578 --> 01:35:38,626
All right.

907
01:35:38,698 --> 01:35:39,942
- What?
- Brakes. Brakes.

908
01:35:40,042 --> 01:35:41,733
Slow us down.

909
01:35:41,802 --> 01:35:42,882
Okay.

910
01:35:46,634 --> 01:35:48,128
Uh-oh. Big mistake.

911
01:35:48,202 --> 01:35:49,347
Big mistake, Indy.

912
01:35:49,418 --> 01:35:51,109
Figures.

913
01:36:11,499 --> 01:36:12,961
We're going too fast!

914
01:36:13,036 --> 01:36:14,083
Too fast!

915
01:36:14,156 --> 01:36:15,683
We're going to crash!

916
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:29,220
Water, water, water!

917
01:36:29,292 --> 01:36:30,819
Oh, look!
Look there!

918
01:36:30,924 --> 01:36:32,615
- Water!
- Fire! You're on fire!

919
01:36:32,684 --> 01:36:33,578
Water, water!

920
01:36:33,644 --> 01:36:34,538
Look...

921
01:36:34,604 --> 01:36:35,532
Water, water.

922
01:36:37,549 --> 01:36:39,403
Water, water.

923
01:36:39,469 --> 01:36:41,858
Come on...
Come on!

924
01:36:54,605 --> 01:36:55,914
Let's go!

925
01:36:59,693 --> 01:37:00,969
Run, run!

926
01:37:13,166 --> 01:37:15,206
Willie, look out!

927
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:25,478
No!

928
01:37:25,614 --> 01:37:27,850
Head for the bridge. Go!

929
01:37:30,095 --> 01:37:31,305
Come on, Willie, this way.

930
01:37:43,823 --> 01:37:44,968
Oh, God.

931
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:46,697
Come on, let's go.

932
01:37:46,767 --> 01:37:47,814
Strong bridge.

933
01:37:47,887 --> 01:37:49,131
Come on, let's go.

934
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:50,214
Strong bridge.

935
01:37:50,287 --> 01:37:52,840
Look-- strong wood.

936
01:37:52,911 --> 01:37:54,318
Come on!

937
01:37:54,383 --> 01:37:55,015
Look!

938
01:37:55,791 --> 01:37:56,838
Shorty!

939
01:37:59,823 --> 01:38:00,717
Help!

940
01:38:00,783 --> 01:38:01,732
I'm falling down.

941
01:38:03,471 --> 01:38:05,610
Help!

942
01:38:06,928 --> 01:38:08,815
Not very funny.

943
01:38:32,625 --> 01:38:33,934
Back!

944
01:38:58,674 --> 01:39:01,358
Welcome.

945
01:39:10,578 --> 01:39:11,723
Ow!

946
01:39:11,794 --> 01:39:14,762
Let her go, Mola Ram.

947
01:39:14,834 --> 01:39:17,169
You are in a position
unsuitable

948
01:39:17,234 --> 01:39:18,990
to give orders.

949
01:39:19,058 --> 01:39:20,269
Watch your back!

950
01:39:27,571 --> 01:39:30,702
You want the stones,
let 'em go.

951
01:39:35,091 --> 01:39:36,433
Let her go!

952
01:39:38,195 --> 01:39:40,267
Drop them, Dr.Jones.

953
01:39:40,339 --> 01:39:42,379
They will be found.

954
01:39:42,451 --> 01:39:44,753
You won't.

955
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:48,911
Indy!

956
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:51,347
Behind you!

957
01:39:58,324 --> 01:40:00,713
Oh, shit.

958
01:40:10,261 --> 01:40:12,148
Go on.

959
01:40:12,212 --> 01:40:14,929
Go.

960
01:40:23,829 --> 01:40:26,033
Go on!
Go on!

961
01:40:26,101 --> 01:40:28,468
That way.

962
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:33,521
Shorty...

963
01:40:38,837 --> 01:40:39,765
Hang on, lady.

964
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:41,259
We going for a ride.

965
01:40:42,710 --> 01:40:44,783
Oh, my God!

966
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:48,139
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

967
01:40:48,214 --> 01:40:49,872
Oh, my God!

968
01:40:49,942 --> 01:40:51,830
Is he nuts?

969
01:40:51,894 --> 01:40:54,098
He no nuts.

970
01:40:54,166 --> 01:40:55,922
He's crazy.

971
01:40:55,990 --> 01:41:00,268
Mola Ram,
prepare to meet Kali...

972
01:41:00,406 --> 01:41:02,545
in hell.

973
01:41:03,383 --> 01:41:04,463
What are you doing?!

974
01:41:04,535 --> 01:41:05,549
You fool!

975
01:42:04,024 --> 01:42:05,683
Indy, cover your heart!

976
01:42:05,753 --> 01:42:08,142
Cover your heart!

977
01:42:08,217 --> 01:42:09,940
Oh, my God!

978
01:42:19,449 --> 01:42:20,660
Oh, my God.

979
01:43:02,011 --> 01:43:03,288
- Look out!
- No!

980
01:43:28,252 --> 01:43:29,266
No!

981
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:35,543
Hurry! Let's go!

982
01:43:35,613 --> 01:43:38,002
The stones are mine!

983
01:43:38,076 --> 01:43:40,859
You've betrayed Siva.

984
01:43:44,957 --> 01:43:46,451
You betrayed Siva.

985
01:43:55,261 --> 01:43:56,723
You betrayed Siva!

986
01:44:27,615 --> 01:44:29,306
Well, it's about time.

987
01:44:46,399 --> 01:44:48,407
Hold your fire.

988
01:46:45,059 --> 01:46:48,125
We know you are coming back

989
01:46:48,195 --> 01:46:51,043
when life return to our village.

990
01:46:54,500 --> 01:47:01,408
Now you can see the magic
of the rock you bring back.

991
01:47:01,477 --> 01:47:05,405
Yes, I understand its power now.

992
01:47:10,405 --> 01:47:11,998
You could've kept it.

993
01:47:12,069 --> 01:47:13,214
Ah, what for?

994
01:47:13,285 --> 01:47:14,692
They'd just put it in a museum.

995
01:47:14,757 --> 01:47:16,513
It'd be another rock
collecting dust.

996
01:47:16,581 --> 01:47:19,396
But then it would've given you
your fortune and glory.

997
01:47:19,461 --> 01:47:21,316
Anything could happen.

998
01:47:21,381 --> 01:47:23,105
It's a long way to Delhi.

999
01:47:23,173 --> 01:47:24,733
No, thanks.

1000
01:47:24,805 --> 01:47:27,194
No more adventures
with you, Dr.Jones.

1001
01:47:27,269 --> 01:47:30,750
Sweetheart, after all the fun
we've had together?

1002
01:47:30,822 --> 01:47:34,204
If you think I'm going to Delhi
with you, or anyplace else

1003
01:47:34,277 --> 01:47:34,437
after all the trouble
you've gotten me into,

1004
01:47:34,437 --> 01:47:36,641
after all the trouble
you've gotten me into,

1005
01:47:36,709 --> 01:47:38,302
think again, buster!

1006
01:47:38,373 --> 01:47:40,829
I'm going home to Missouri where
they never feed you snakes,

1007
01:47:40,901 --> 01:47:43,552
before ripping your heart out
and lowering you into hot pits!

1008
01:47:43,621 --> 01:47:46,938
This is not my idea
of a swell time!

1009
01:47:47,078 --> 01:47:48,322
Excuse me, sir.

1010
01:47:48,390 --> 01:47:49,797
I need a guide to Delhi.
If you could...

1011
01:48:03,655 --> 01:48:05,477
Oh...

1012
01:48:08,838 --> 01:48:11,010
Very funny.

1013
01:48:16,327 --> 01:48:17,734
Very funny.

1014
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,145
Uh-oh.
