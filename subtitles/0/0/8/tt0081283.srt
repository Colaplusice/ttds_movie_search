Well. Regionally.

I think he moved to Skokie.

203

This new mechanic is so awkward.

Is that shirt ripped?

205

Leave it on the table
in the hallway.

in the hospital from Skokie?

345
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,240
Are you having fun?

346
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,600
Fun?

347
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,200
There's no point
if you're not having fun.

348
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,200
Yeah. I guess so.

349
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,640
You guess so.

350
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,200
Are you on medication?

351
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,680
Tranquilizers?

352
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,000
Anything?

353
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,600
No. No. Sir.

354
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,280
Did I ask you
if they gave you shock?

355
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,840
Yeah.

356
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,440
Yeah what?

357
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,320
Yeah. You asked me.

358
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,840
Yeah. They did.

359
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,000
Don't look at us. Lazenby.

360
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,000
Get in the water!

361
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,240
I'm no doctor. Jarrett.

362
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,040
I wouldn't let them
put electricity in my head.

363
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,080
He drives me nuts!

364
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,840
Everybody drives you nuts.

365
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,080
Don and Fenetch looked good.

366
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,000
They looked very good.

367
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,000
Is he giving you a hard time?

368
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,000
Want a clarinet?

369
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,000
Van Buren wants a clarinet.

370
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,520
Who's selling it?

371
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,520
My brother.
He needs a motorcycle.

372
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,040
You stand behind me
in the choir.

373
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,720
Oh. I do?
Is that you?

374
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,160
You have a lot of energy.

375
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,240
I do?

376
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,040
I mean. That's good.

377
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,080
My name's Jeannine Pratt.

378
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,560
Nice. Hi.

379
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,080
You're Conrad Jarrett.

380
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,280
Right.

381
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,080
Yeah. Um. Bye.

382
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,560
Bye-bye.

383
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,560
"You've got a lot of energy."

384
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,560
[Children]
Trick or treat!

385
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,080
You're the scariest
ghost I've ever seen!

386
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,600
You look wonderful.

387
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,600
Thank you.

388
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,600
There you go.

389
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,080
Be careful.

390
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,080
Thank you.
Good-bye.

391
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,600
The Cabots.
Julie's first time.

392
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,600
She's so cute!

393
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,000
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

394
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,280
Know what I've been thinking?

395
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,280
That Christmas in London...

396
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,800
would be like something
out of Dickens.

397
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,280
We've never done that before.

398
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,800
Maybe we shouldn't plan
to go away right now.

399
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,800
We talked about it.

400
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,800
We decided on that.

401
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,800
Yeah. I know that.

402
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,800
But the timing
doesn't seem right.

403
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,800
We've always gone away
at Christmas.

404
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,520
It'd be good for him. Too.

405
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,040
Let's get back to normal.

406
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,800
He's just started
with this doctor.

407
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,800
He'll miss three weeks.

408
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,320
Why interrupt it?

409
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,320
Because I want to get away.

410
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,320
I think we should.
It's important.

411
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,840
Not if he doesn't
go through with this now.

412
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,320
He might change his mind.

413
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,840
If he changes his mind...

414
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,080
it wasn't right for him.

415
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,440
Does he want to go?

416
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,440
He doesn't know what he wants.

417
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,400
Ahh!

418
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,160
Don't do that!

419
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,680
I'm sorry.

420
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,680
I didn't think you were here.

421
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,680
I just got in.

422
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,680
No golf today.
Too cold.

423
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,160
How was golf?

424
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,680
I didn't play.

425
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,160
It's colder today.

426
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,680
I mean. For the year.
It's colder.

427
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,320
Weren't you swimming?

428
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,800
Yeah. Sorry I scared you.

429
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,320
How'd it go?

430
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,320
Good. I swam well.

431
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,320
Good.

432
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,840
I could swim the 50 if my...

433
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,840
my timing got better.

434
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,840
I'm a little off.

435
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,320
You must work at that.

436
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,320
Yeah.

437
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,440
I got 74 on a Trig quiz.

438
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,960
74?

439
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,960
Gee. I was awful at Trig.

440
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,480
Oh. Yeah? Did you...

441
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,720
You took Trig?

442
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,640
Wait a minute.

443
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,600
Did I take Trig?

444
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,960
I bought you two shirts.
They're on your bed.

445
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,560
Who'll be there?

446
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,680
Well. The Murrays.
The Gunthers. And the Caines.

447
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,520
Let's go to the movies instead.

448
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,280
Don't be negative.

449
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,680
That's not negative.
That's unpredictable.

450
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,080
Let's go to the movies.

451
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,560
Okay.

452
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,160
Really?

453
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,000
Okay. Yeah.
Come on. Let's go.

454
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,520
What's our excuse?

455
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,360
Beth wanted to go
to the movies.

456
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,520
Good.

457
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,120
Very good.

458
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,640
All right now. Smile.

459
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,560
Remember. Not too many martinis.

460
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,640
Will you put that
with the others?

461
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,640
Look. We're in time.

462
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,160
Look who's here!

463
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,160
Three blocks away
and the last to arrive.

464
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,640
Come on in.

465
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,160
Happy birthday!
You look wonderful.

466
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,680
Is that new?

467
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,680
Yes. It is.
Do you like it?

468
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,080
You did the mousse?

469
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,480
It turned out well?

470
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,080
Hey. Partner.
How are you?

471
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,840
Hi there.

472
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,800
Hi. Beth.

473
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,400
Good to see you.

474
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,800
Borrow the money.

475
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,320
I'll go public.

476
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,480
I wouldn't do it now
because the market's low.

477
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,320
Your hair looks wonderful.

478
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,920
It's shorter. You like it?

479
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,600
I said.
"Please put out your cigar."

480
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,480
He says. "Huh?
I don't have another one."

481
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,080
Good to see you!

482
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,440
You look beautiful. As ever.

483
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,920
In school...

484
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,120
they think they've got
to walk on the edge of danger.

485
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,280
What are these hushed tones?

486
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,400
He told the funniest joke!

487
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,080
I'm not talking to you.

488
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,440
Why?

489
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,200
I have my fingers crossed
on this merger.

490
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,440
Let's have lunch.

491
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,800
I don't know my schedule.

492
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,120
I'm free most days.

493
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,800
Bob McLean's leaving
Coles and Johnson.

494
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,800
Where is he going?

495
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,840
He doesn't know.

496
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,120
Jesus.

497
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,680
No. You didn't.

498
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,080
Isn't he the meanest man
you've met?

499
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,440
When a ball is in play.

500
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,480
If a player or caddy
accidentally move it...

501
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,680
#Jolly good fellow #

502
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,200
# For he's a jolly good fellow ##

503
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,480
# Won't regret. Can't forget #

504
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,880
# What we did #

505
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,480
# For #

506
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,320
# Love ##

507
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,160
Hi. Annie. What's your boy up to?

508
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,680
Oh. Who knows?

509
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,520
How's Conrad doing?

510
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,520
He's great. Just great.

511
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,800
I asked Donald.
He says they haven't talked much.

512
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,520
I said maybe he's self-conscious.

513
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,520
Oh!

514
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,520
No. No. No.

515
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,520
No. He's...

516
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,120
There's a doctor
in Highland Park...

517
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,520
that he sees twice a week.

518
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,880
He's great. Just great.

519
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,120
Is he still having some problems?

520
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,040
No. Nothing like that.

521
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,560
Just somebody to talk to...

522
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,960
to polish off the rough edges.

523
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,600
How are you. Darling?

524
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,120
Is he falling asleep on you?

525
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,920
Nah. He's great.

526
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,000
[Mimicking "Mr. Wonderful"]
# Mr. Great. That's me #

527
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,000
Hey.

528
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,800
You drank too much.

529
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,320
I'm not drunk.

530
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,960
Why did you tell Annie
about Conrad's psychiatrist?

531
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,480
Why not?

532
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,640
People don't hear
that thing easily.

533
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,160
For most people.
It's a status symbol.

534
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,640
Well. Your blurting it out...

535
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,640
was a violation of privacy.

536
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,160
Whose privacy?

537
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,040
The family's privacy!

538
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,040
I think it is
a very private matter.

539
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,080
I tell you my dreams?

540
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,560
I don't believe in dreams.

541
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,080
What kind of
a psychiatrist are you?

542
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,560
What's happening?

543
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,000
What's going on?

544
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,000
I just feel...

545
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
I feel so...

546
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,120
What?

547
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,000
Jumpy. I don't know.

548
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,560
Look. Kiddo...

549
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,200
I lied.

550
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,240
I believe in dreams.

551
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,240
Sometimes I want to know
what's happening when you're awake.

552
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,640
Something's making you nervous.

553
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,160
Maybe I need a tranquilizer.

554
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,320
Tranquilizer?

555
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,720
What do you think?

556
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,240
You look like something
out of The Body Snatchers.

557
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,560
It's not my impression
that you need a tranquilizer.

558
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,120
What is this?

559
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,920
A clock.

560
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,440
You can tell the time.
But I can't.

561
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,600
So you know when
the hour's up?

562
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,960
Right.

563
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,640
50. 55 minutes?

564
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,160
Maybe I don't want
to swim anymore.

565
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,680
My timing is for shit.

566
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,200
Two guys better than me
swim the 50.

567
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,200
They're a bunch of boring jocks.

568
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,240
And him...
I can't stand him.

569
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,040
Thought about quitting?

570
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
You telling me to?

571
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,720
Nope.

572
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,920
It wouldn't look good.

573
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,360
How does it feel?

574
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,400
How does it feel?

575
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,880
Yes.
How does it feel?

576
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,160
It's the same damn thing
I did last year.

577
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,960
Are you the same
person now?

578
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,120
That's why you need
a tranquilizer?

579
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,240
You're a doctor.

580
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,600
I'm supposed to
feel better. Right?

581
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,160
Not necessarily.

582
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,080
Is it getting any easier
with your friends?

583
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,200
No. It's still hard.

584
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,200
Is anyplace easy?

585
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,440
The hospital was.

586
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,320
It was? Why?

587
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,680
Because nobody
hid anything there.

588
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,400
Was there anyone there
you could talk to?

589
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,560
Uh-huh.

590
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,080
I mean, beside Dr. Crawford?

591
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,600
Uh-huh.

592
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,200
Whoa!

593
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,800
Hi.

594
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,800
Karen!

595
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,320
How are you?

596
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,480
Good.

597
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,960
Sit down. Please.

598
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,080
Thank you.

599
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,520
Wow.

600
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,360
When did you get back?

601
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,360
The end of August.

602
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,360
Good.

603
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,360
It's great to see you.

604
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,400
Oh. You. Too.

605
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,880
Listen. I've got a meeting
over at the school.

606
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,400
Drama Club meeting.

607
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,880
We're doing
A Thousand Clowns.

608
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,400
You know it?

609
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,080
Anyway. We're going crazy
getting it together.

610
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,400
Don't let me hang you up.

611
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,120
No. I wanted to see you.

612
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,120
I didn't know what to expect.

613
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,120
You sounded funny on the phone.

614
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,120
It was just a gray day.

615
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,200
Everything's great.
I'm on the swim team.

616
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,880
Oh. You're swimming?

617
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
Terrific. Conrad.

618
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,560
That's really wonderful.

619
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,040
I could be benched all year.

620
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,440
You'll do great.

621
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,840
I'll bet your folks
are real proud of you.

622
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,840
Yeah.

623
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,200
What can I get you?

624
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,680
Are you hungry?

625
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,200
Just a coke.

626
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,640
Two cokes. Please.

627
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,480
Did we offend him?

628
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,680
Something I said?

629
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,920
A low self-image day.

630
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,520
So. Uh...

631
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,880
- Are you...
- What did...

632
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,920
I can't believe
how beautiful you look.

633
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,320
You really look beautiful.

634
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,640
So do you.

635
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,360
Do you miss it?

636
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,600
Miss what?

637
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,840
The hospital.

638
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,920
No.

639
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,680
Thank you.

640
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,480
You don't miss it?

641
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,680
No.

642
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,480
You don't miss Leo's corny jokes?

643
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,160
Are you seeing a doctor?

644
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,160
Yeah. I'm seeing one. Are you?

645
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,320
Uh. Dr. Crawford gave me a name.

646
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,800
I went for a while.

647
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,800
It didn't work.

648
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,320
He told me the things
I already knew.

649
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,840
Finally. I decided...

650
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,960
the only one who
can help me is myself.

651
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,800
At least. That's what
my dad says.

652
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,480
If it's something
you want to do.

653
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,320
That's what you
should be doing.

654
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,160
I don't know
how long I'll keep it up.

655
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,760
Your hair grew in.

656
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,160
Oh. That was such
a dumb thing to do.

657
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,840
I like it.

658
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,360
You do?

659
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,840
Yeah.

660
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,360
I don't know.
I just...

661
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,360
I miss it sometimes.

662
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,880
The hospital.

663
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,600
I really do.

664
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,440
Things have to change. You know?

665
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,720
But that's where we laughed.

666
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,120
But that was a hospital.

667
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,680
This is the real world.

668
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,600
I guess you're right.

669
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,360
I really have to go.

670
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,680
I'm sorry.

671
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,120
I have a meeting at the school.

672
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,640
We're doing A Thousand Clowns.

673
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,640
You told me.

674
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,280
Did I?

675
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,640
Yeah.

676
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,120
I better hurry.

677
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,640
Don't want to be late.

678
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,320
Thanks for seeing me.

679
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,640
Conrad?

680
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,240
Let's have a great Christmas.

681
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,680
Okay?

682

00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,600
a great year.

684

Let's have the best year
of our lives.

685
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,560
This could be
the best year ever.

Will you call me?

690
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,920
Yeah.

691
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,400
You mean it?

692
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,400
Yep.

693
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,400

700
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,720
It's cold.

701
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,200
You should put that on.

702
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,200
Do you want a sweater?

703
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,600
Do I need one?

704
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,720
What are you doing?

705
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,240
Nothing.

706
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,840

707
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,520
About what?

708
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,040
Not about anything.

709
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,040
Your hair is starting to grow out.

710
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,040
It's looking... looking better.

711
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,840
I was thinking
about the pigeon...

712
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,320
that hung around the garage.

713
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,160
How it used to get
on top of your car.

714
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,720
Oh. Yeah.
I remember.

715
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,320
I remember
how scared I got...

716
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,320
That wsssshhhhh!
Flap. Flap. Flap...

717
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,320
Every time I started the car.

718
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,520
That was the closest
we came to having a pet.

719
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,000
Buck tried to talk you
into getting a dog.

720
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,520
He said. "If it's the size
of a football?"

721
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,520
You know.
That animal next door...

722
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,600
that Pepper or Pippin...

723
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,440
Pippin. Pippin. Pippin.

724
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,280
He's not friendly...

725
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,840
whatever Mr. McGreary says.

726
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,000
He wanted the retriever.

727
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,920
Each time that dog comes here.
I try to get him out.

728
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,120
Arf!

729
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,720
Arf! Arf!

730
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,560
Put that on
if you're staying out here.

731
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,720
Can I help?

732
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,240
With this?

733
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,400
No.

734
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,480
I will.

735
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,320
You can go to your room...

736
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,280
and clean the closet.

737
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,240
Mom.

738
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,320
Okay?

739
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,160
Because it's really a mess.

Oh. Hi.

I didn't get there.

No. I'm not doing anything.

Mary Ann Ramon started
just to scream. Right?

752
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,760
We got so drunk.
We couldn't talk.

753
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,040
It was the last day of school.

We walked out

No. Stop!

00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,840
We just don't connect.

00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,280
That I jack off a lot.

763
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,320
So what else is new?

00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,800
Does it help?

He didn't
know what to say.

773
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,840
He put his
arm around me.

774
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,800
We just sat there.

775
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,800
I remember watching his shoe.
And thinking...

776
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,280
His shoe was turned
over on its side.

777
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,680
I was thinking. He's so uptight!
It's gonna crack off.

778
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,000
I knew I should've
felt something.

00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,800
I didn't know what to feel.

On TV. They say stuff
like. "Oh. No!"

781

But I didn't say that...

782
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,320
because I didn't feel sad...

so much as...

So much as what?

785
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,840
I kept thinking John-Boy
would've said something...

786
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,680
about how he felt.

787

What would he say?

does the hiring.

I don't know
what else to do.

853
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,880
I'm not asking for anything.

854
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,400
You're kidding me.

855
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,880
I don't get it.

856
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,880
You're excused from practice...

857
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,800
to see some shrink;

858
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,320
I work with you
at your convenience.

859
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,720
What more should I do?

860
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,840
Nothing.

861
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,720
A bright kid like you.

862
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,760
I don't get it.

863
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,800
Why keep messing up your life?

864
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,160
I don't think that
quitting swimming...

865
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,760
will mess up my life.

866
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,760
Okay.

867
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,040
Okay. Now. This is it.

868
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,200
Yeah.

869
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,080
You're a big kid.

870
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,040
Actions have consequences.

871
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,240
I'm not taking you back.

872
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,720
I won't ask you to.

873
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,800
[Laughing]

874
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,840
What happened?
You all right?

875
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,200
Yeah.

876
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,800
You quit the swim team.

877
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,320
Yeah.

878
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,840
Why?

879
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,320
It was a bore.

880
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,320
That's no reason!

881
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,840
What's going on?

882
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,320
Nothing.

883
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,840
Talk to me.

884
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,840
Swimming's a bore. That's all.

885
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,840
I talked to...

886
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,680
Quit talking to people!

887
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,320
Okay?

888
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,360
Holy shit.

889
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,360
Yeah. Sure.

890
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,360
Fuck you. Jarrett.

891
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,360
Ooh! Ohh!

892
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,840
Shut up.

893
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,360
Leave it alone.

894
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,360
I told you. The guy's a flake.

895
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,280
- What did your dad say?
- I haven't told him.

896
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,920
How come?

897
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,080
The timing isn't right.

898
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,680
He sweats everything.

899
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,880
He'll just get worried.

900
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,880
Can you tell your mother?

901
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,320
My mother?

902
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,800
I told you we don't connect.

903
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,320
What do people have
in common with mothers anyway?

904
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,800
It's all surface junk.

905
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,320
You know?

906
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,320
"Clean your room.
Brush your teeth...

907
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,920
get good grades."

908
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,360
I'm not feeling anything today.

909
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,960
I'm sorry.

910
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,600
No. Sorry's out.

911
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,760
Something's on your mind.

912
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,320
What time is it?

913
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,840
Never mind. There's time.

914
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,240
Remember the contract?
Control?

915
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,360
Maybe there's some connection...

916
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,600
between control
and lack of feeling.

917
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,600
I said I feel things.

918
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,840
When?

919
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,360
Come on.

920
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,360
When?

921
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,080
Sometimes. I don't know.

922
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,840
I thought you didn't
like fooling around.

923
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,640
What do you want?

924
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,480
Don't say. "I don't know."

925
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,040
Should I make up answers?

926
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:42,160
Make one up about
there's no feelings there.

927
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,680
I have feelings.

928
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,280
Get it together. Jarrett.

929
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,520
You're trying to make me mad.

930
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,040
Are you mad?

931
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,800
No!

932
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,800
You don't like being pushed.

933
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,320
Do something about it!

934
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,320
What?

935
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,320
No. I can't do this.

936
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,080
Why not?

937
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,840
Getting mad takes too much energy.

938
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,320
It takes more holding it back.

939
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,840
When I let myself feel.
I feel lousy.

940
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,880
# I never promised you
a rose garden #

941
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,200
Fuck you. Berger.

942
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,720
Fuck you.

943
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,720
Yeah?

944
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,480
That's it.

945
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,480
What do you feel?
Do you jack off?

946
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,520
What do you think?

947
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,840
You married a fat lady...

948
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,360
and you fuck
the daylights out of her!

949
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,000
Sounds good to me.

950
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,960
Little advice
about feeling...

951
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,480
Don't expect it always to tickle.

952
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,160
Do you know how
to aim that?

953
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,960
Be quiet. I have to concentrate.

954
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,520
Be quiet.

955
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,560
Is it in focus?

956
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,560
Smile. Smile.
Okay. Good.

957
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,640
I want to take
the three young ones.

958
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,200
Dad. Get out of there.

959
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,560
All right.

960
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,080
Connie.

961
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,640
Be quiet.

962
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,640
Conrad. Where are you?

963
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,200
Between your mother and father.

964
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,240
You're taller than
your mother is!

965
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,680
Will you be quiet?

966
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,120
This is beautiful.

967
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,840
Shut up.

968
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,360
Wonderful.

969
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,400
Now Cal and Beth.

970
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,440
Sure.

971
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,360
Go on.

972
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,560
You can do better than that.

973
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,840
I want one of Connie and Beth.

974
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,400
Let's get the three men in there.

975
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,960
Move closer to your mother.

976
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,000
Prize winner.

977
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,840
Yeah. That's great.

978
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,280
Do it.

979
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,800
Isn't it marvelous?

980
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,280
Yes. It is.

981
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,280
It isn't cocked.

982
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,720
Calvin.

983
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,000
Hold it. Connie. Smile.

984
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,880
Calvin!

985
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,120
Smile.

986
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,280
Give me the camera.

987
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,880
Give me the camera.

988
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,120
I want a really good picture.

989
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,520
I want a shot of you three men.

990
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,560
Not until I get you two.

991
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,320
Give her
the goddamn camera!

992
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,720
Smile.

993
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,680
Who's hungry?
I'll make the sandwiches.

994
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,120
[Crash]

995
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,080
Beth!

996
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,160
It can be saved.

997
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,840
That was so dumb.

998
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,000
I don't think
he's happy in school.

999
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,120
Have you talked to his teachers?

1000
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,240
People don't want
to be with him.

1001
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,800
He provokes people.

1002
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,360
Well. It's an awkward age.

1003
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,880
Thank you.

1004
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,480
Maybe he needs a change.

1005
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,560
Is he eating enough?

1006
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,480
Yes. Mother.

1007
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,520
He'll be all right.

1008
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,040
If you're firm with him.

1009
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:42,040
I think he should
go away to school.

1010
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,560
I can't deal with him.

1011
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,760
Who'd make that decision?

1012
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:51,040
I suppose this doctor he's seeing.

1013
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,280
What sort of doctor...

1014
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,680
would make that decision for you?

1015
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,200
A psychiatrist.

1016
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,680
I thought that was finished.

1017
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,280
No.

1018
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,280
What's his name?

1019
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,280
Berger.

1020
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,280
Jewish doctor?

1021
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,320
I suppose he's Jewish.

1022
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,800
Maybe just German.

1023
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,800
What does Cal say
about all this?

1024
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,320
This can be saved.

1025
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,080
It's a nice clean break.

1026
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,400
# Amen. Amen. Alleluia #

1027
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,960
# Amen #

1028
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:34,240
# Amen ##

1029
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,760
Okay.

1030
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,280
That last "E" natural
could be higher.

1031
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,240
Officers. Don't forget
your meeting tonight.

1032
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,440
# Mmm mm mmm #

1033
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,480
# Mmm mm mmm #

1034
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,280
# Mmm mmm #

1035
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,120
# Mmm mm mmm #

1036
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,920
Hi. Jeannine.

1037
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,480
You're really a terrific tenor.

1038
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,040
In fact. You should be
doing the solo.

1039
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,080
No. L...

1040
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,640
No. I'm serious.

1041
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,160
You sing well.

1042
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,240
I'm getting to know your voice.

1043
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,800
How can you hear me
if you're singing?

1044
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,360
Well...

1045
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,360
I don't always sing.

1046
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,440
Sometimes I just listen.

1047
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,520
For instance. Marcia Blair
can't sing a note.

1048
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,560
Janet Fox mouths the words
and never sings.

1049
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,160
A detective.

1050
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,760
[Jeannine]
Do you like Vivaldi?

1051
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,240
Telemann?

1052
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,920
[Conrad]
Telemann? Um...

1053
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
What kind of music do you like?

1054
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,400
Oh. Uh...

1055
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,480
Modern jazz. I like.

1056
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:54,000
Folk rock. Spoon on a glass.

1057
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,080
Spoon on a glass?

1058
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,520
Oh. You mean.
Like. Table spoons?

1059
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,600
Oh. Dear.

1060
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,640
Why do I ask dumb questions?

1061
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,680
I'm just showing off.

1062
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,800
Why is it so hard...

1063
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,800
the first time you talk
to somebody?

1064
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,800
You make it look easy.

1065
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,960
Really?

1066
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,800
That's my bus.
I got to go.

1067
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,840
I'll see you later!

1068
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,800
You're really a terrific tenor.

1069
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,640
# Ah. You're
just saying that #

1070
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,320
# Alleluia #

1071
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,560
# Alleluia #

1072
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,560
# Alleluia #

1073
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,600
# Alleluia #

1074
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,960
# Ah ha ha ha

1075
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,160
# Ha ha ha ha

1076
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,040
# Alleluia. Alleluia #

1077
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,760
# Alleluia #

1078
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,960

01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,640

01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,680
# Alleluia ##

1083
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,760
Hello.

1084
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,280
Is Karen there?

1085
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,800
Who's calling?

1086
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,840
A friend of hers from Hillsboro.

1087
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,560
Oh.

1088
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,600
She's not home from school yet.

1089
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,280
Oh. Um...

1090
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,840
Hmm. Tell her I called.

1091
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,360
This is Conrad.

1092
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,920
Tell her I'm feeling great...

1093
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,960
and I wanted to talk to her.

1094
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,480
Yes. I will.

1095
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,560
Thank you.

1096
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,200
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Conrad.

1097
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,400
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Conrad.

1098
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:09,040
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Conrad.

1099
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,800
Conrad.

1100
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,200
Conrad?

1101
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,080
What a dumb name.

1102
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,920
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Bill.

1103
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,240
Uuuuugh!

1104
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,880
Hello.

1105
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:28,360
Hello. This is...

1106
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,360
Hello. This is Conrad calling.

1107
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,840
Jarrett.

1108
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,280
Oh.

1109
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,280
Oh. Hi!

1110
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,800
Listen. I was...

1111
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,800
I was wondering
if maybe you'd like...

1112
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,280
to go out sometime.

1113
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,320
Like on a date?

1114
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:46,800
We wouldn't have
to call it a date.

1115
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,320
We could see how it goes.

1116
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:53,320
That was dumb.
Now start over.

1117
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,800
This is Conrad Jarrett.

1118
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,600
I'd love to. When?

1119
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,800
I didn't see you.

1120
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,640
What do you think?

1121
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,000
Fine.

1122
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,840
Rawlins used to have
great scotch pines.

1123
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:42,640
They look like
skeletons this year.

1124
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,200
Hi. What do you think?

1125
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,640
It's very nice.

1126
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,600
What is wrong?

1127
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,120
Ask him what's wrong.

1128
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,920
Maybe you won't have to
hear it from Carol Lazenby.

1129
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,360
Hear what?

1130
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,560
I quit the swim team.

1131
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,760
Carol thought I knew.

1132
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,840
It happened over a month ago.

1133
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,280
Quit? When?

1134
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,040
Where have you been every night?

1135
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,040
Nowhere.
The library mostly.

1136
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,840
I didn't think it mattered.

1137
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,320
That was meant for me.

1138
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,640
It's important to hurt me. Right?

1139
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,600
You have that backwards.

1140
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:32,640
Do I embarrass you
in front of friends?

1141
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,720
"Poor Beth believes
every lie her son tells."

1142
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,280
I didn't lie.

1143
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:42,360
You did when
you came home at 6:30!

1144
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:46,520
If the lying's starting again.
I can't stand it!

1145
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,840
Then go to Europe!

1146
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:54,280
She only gives a fuck because
someone else knew about it first!

1147
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,680
She never came
to the hospital...

1148
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,280
because she's busy going
to goddamn Spain and Portugal!

1149
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:05,880
She doesn't care if I'm hung up
by the balls out there.

1150
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,760
They may talk like this
at the hospital...

1151
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,320
but we're not at the hospital.

1152
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,840
You never came to the hospital!

1153
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,600
She had the flu
and couldn't come inside.

1154
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,640
She would've visited Buck
in the hospital!

1155
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:22,640
Buck never would've been
in the hospital!

1156
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,360
That is enough!

1157
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:27,160
I won't do it again.

1158
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,840
What in hell has happened?

1159
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,440
Somebody better go up there.

1160
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,880
He walks all over us...

1161
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,120
then you apologize to him.

1162
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,920
You've been apologizing to him...

1163
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,080
since he returned from the hospital!

1164
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,600
I'm trying to
goddamn understand him!

1165
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,320
Don't talk to me...

1166
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,960
the way he talks to you.

1167
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,480
Let's not fight. Okay?

1168
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,120
No fighting. Okay?

1169
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,080
Please.

1170
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,800
Let's go upstairs.

1171
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,320
I want to talk to you.

1172
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,960
I didn't mean any of it.

1173
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,200
Please don't be mad.

1174
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,160
I'm trying to
understand what happened.

1175
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,720
I don't know what happened.

1176
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,720
I didn't mean it.

1177
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,960
Tell her I'm sorry. Will you?

1178
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,120
Why don't you?

1179
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,960
God. I can't!

1180
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,520
I can't talk to her!

1181
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,040
Why not?

1182
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,080
It doesn't change anything.

1183
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:49,720
It doesn't change
the way she looks at me.

1184
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:53,800
She was hurt because
you quit the team.

1185
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,360
I don't mean just now.

1186
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,920
I don't mean just today.

1187
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Explain it to me.

1188
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,040
I can't. You don't see things.

1189
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,600
What things?

1190
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,280
What things?

1191
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,360
I want you to tell me.

1192
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,520
Can't you see she hates me?

1193
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,520
She doesn't hate you.

1194
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,080
You're right.
She doesn't.

1195
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,160
Please leave me alone.

1196
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,440
Do you think Dr. Berger's helping you?

1197
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,400
It's not his fault.

1198
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,520
I'll be downstairs if you need me.

1199
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,920
Tuesday everything was hunky-dory.

1200
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,440
You're the doctor.

1201
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:03,400
Don't take refuge
in one-liners. Okay?

1202
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,400
Because that pisses me off.

1203
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,880
Okay. Okay.

1204
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,400
Everything was fine...

1205
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,400
till you had the fight
with your mother?

1206
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:13,880
I don't blame her.

1207
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,400
She's got her reasons.
It's impossible...

1208
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,400
after all the shit I've pulled.

1209
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,400
What shit have you pulled?

1210
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,320
I'm talking about proportion.

1211
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,320
Now. What shit?

1212
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:34,360
You can find one example.

1213
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,360
Don't say you tried suicide.

1214
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,360
What have you done lately?

1215
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:42,040
I'll never be forgiven for that.

1216
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,600
Never.

1217
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:47,800
You can't get out
the blood in her towels...

1218
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,880
and in her rug.

1219
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,480
Everything
had to be pitched.

1220
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,160
The bathroom tile
had to be regrouted.

1221
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,960
She fired the maid...

1222
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,880
because she couldn't dust right.

1223
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,480
If you think I'll forgive...

1224
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,040
she's gonna forgive me...

1225
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,200
What?

1226
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:38,080
I think I just figured
something out.

1227
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,600
What?

1228
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,640
Who it is who can't forgive who.

1229
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,360
[Berger]
A real problem has a real solution.

1230
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,440
[Conrad]
I've heard this before.

1231
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,520
Doesn't make it any less true.

1232
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,080
I'm so tired.

1233
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:02,200
That's some secret
you've been keeping.

1234
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,280
So what do I do now?

1235
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,920
Recognize her limitations.

1236
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,520
Like she can't love me.

1237
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:16,560
No. Like she can't
love you enough.

1238
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,800
Don't blame her
for not loving you...

1239
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,840
more than she's able.

1240
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,920
She loves my father.

1241
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
She loved my brother.

1242
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,720
It's me.

1243
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,880
We're back to
the rotten kid routine.

1244
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,800
She can't love you
because you're unlovable.

1245
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,960
How come your Dad loves you?

1246
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,520
He feels responsible.

1247
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,560
Besides. He loves everybody.

1248
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,160
The guy's got no taste.

1249
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,240
He loves you. But he's wrong.

1250
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,800
Look...

1251
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,840
maybe she can't express it...

1252
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,880
the way you'd like.

1253
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,240
Maybe she's afraid
to show her feelings.

1254
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,520
What do you mean?

1255
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,920
There's someone
besides your mother...

1256
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,600
you've got to forgive.

1257
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,440
You mean me?

1258
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,840
For trying to off myself?

1259
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,960
Don't stare.
What for?

1260
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:19,000
Why don't you let yourself
off the hook?

1261
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,080
What did I do?

1262
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,760
What did I do?

1263
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,280
We'll talk Thursday.

1264
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,280
Come on!

1265
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,080
Time's up.

1266
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,600
What did I do?

1267
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,080
You know the rules.

1268
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,640
What rules?

1269
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:35,400
Think about it.

1270
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,040
Just think about it.

1271
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,480
Jesus!

1272
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:48,240
Say. After going to a new high...

1273
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,680
it falls to 1121/4...

1274
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,760
and then rallies on good volume.

1275
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,240
I order to buy 4.000.

1276
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,600
If I get the 4.000 at 1133/4.
I know something's wrong.

1277
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:04,600
But suppose I order
to buy the 4.000 shares...

1278
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,520
and I plug in at 1133/4...

1279
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,480
I get 2.000 at 114.
500 at 1141/4...

1280
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,400
and the rest on the way up.

1281
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,480
Then I know I'm right.

1282
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,440
I'm going to peel off here.

1283
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,440
See you later.

1284
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,800
[Voice Echoing]
Suppose the order to buy...

1285
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,840
[Beth's Voice]
You let him walk all over us...

1286
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,160
and you apologize.

1287
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,880
[Man's Voice]
500 at 114...

1288
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,920
[Conrad's Voice]
Dad, you don't see things.

1289
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,800
[Beth]
You've been apologizing...

1290
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:41,160
since he returned from the hospital.

1291
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,160
Tell her to stop it!

1292
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:46,280
Buck never would've
been in the hospital!

1293
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,720
She hates me!

1294
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,720
I want to be clear.

1295
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,600
That's good.

1296
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:20,080
In the car.
I was thinking. "be clear."

1297
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,960
I suppose that's what
psychiatry's about.

1298
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,400
Being precise and clear.

1299
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,440
And honest, of course.

1300
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:35,800
I'm not a great believer
in psychiatry.

1301
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,600
Okay.

1302
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:41,320
What happens here
is between you and him...

1303
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,400
and I respect that.

1304
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,880
He's better.
I can see that.

1305
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,760
I just don't believe in psychiatry...

1306
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,080
as a panacea for everybody.

1307
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,640
Neither do I.

1308
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:01,160
I wish I knew what
I was doing here.

1309
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:05,200
You said you could shed
some light on some things.

1310
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,840
I meant in terms of Conrad.

1311
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,400
I knew something was wrong...

1312
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,960
even before he tried suicide.

1313
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,040
But I thought that...

1314
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:20,120
It's clear that he's very smart.

1315
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,200
He's always been
an "A" student.

1316
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,760
Naturally. I thought
intelligent people...

1317
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,240
could work out their problems.

1318
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,920
But you still feel responsible?

1319
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,000
Yeah, sure I do.

1320
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,120
It's hard not to.

1321
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:39,760
It was just luck that
I happened to be there...

1322
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,800
when he tried it.

1323
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,560
We both could've been away.

1324
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,600
You think of yourself
as a lucky man?

1325
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,200
No. No. No.

1326
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:55,280
I used to think that
I was a lucky person...

1327
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,040
before the accident.

1328
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:04,720
I guess the whole of life...

1329
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,280
is nothing but an accident...

1330
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,200
what happens to you.

1331
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,200
That sounds like
the philosophy of a drifter.

1332
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,120
Yeah. Maybe.

1333
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,520
Maybe I am drifting a little.

1334
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,120
I can see the two of them...

1335
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,200
drifting away from me...

1336
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,800
and I just stand watching.

1337
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:29,040
What would you want
to do about that?

1338
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,600
Something.
I don't know what.

1339
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:35,120
I feel like
I'm sitting on a fence.

1340
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:38,240
They're on opposite sides
of this fence?

1341
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,040
Yeah... No.

1342
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,320
I don't know.

1343
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:46,960
I see her not being able
to forgive him.

1344
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,560
For what?

1345
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,560
I don't know exactly.

1346
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,120
Being too much like her.

1347
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:59,240
People always think that
she and Buck are... were alike.

1348
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,320
But it's really she and Conrad.

1349
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,880
They were the only two...

1350
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,960
that didn't cry at the funeral.

1351
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:13,080
It's not easy for me to admit this...

1352
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,600
but. Um...

1353
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,160
she didn't...

1354
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:23,680
His mother doesn't
show him much affection.

1355
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,400
I'm not trying
to put her down.

1356
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:31,000
Did she give Buck
much affection?

1357
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,520
God. Yes.
She loved Buck.

1358
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,560
Bucky got so much.

1359
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:39,160
What she felt for him was special.

1360
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,760
He was her first-born.

1361
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,600
And you?

1362
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,160
I loved Buck.

1363
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,360
I mean your wife's affection.

1364
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,920
For me?

1365
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,280
Yes.

1366
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,160
She's very...

1367
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:57,320
No. There's no problem
with her for me.

1368
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:01,080
We've been married
nearly 21 years.

Everybody loves Beth.

1370
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:07,120
For Conrad. It's been difficult.

1371
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,000
He didn't talk about that?

1372
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:13,080
We don't know what happens here.

1373
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,120
It doesn't come up.

1374
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,560
I guess that's what it is.

1375
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,960
It's private here. Isn't it?

1376
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,440
Mm-hmm.
Very private.

1377
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:34,160
I think I know why I came here.

1378
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:39,600
I think I came here
to talk about myself.

1379
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:42,440
Okay. Why don't we?

1380
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,280
Hi.

[Buzzing Continues]

1384
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,920
What's the matter?

1385
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,560
This will sound strange.

1386
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:14,120
What I'm going to say
will sound strange.

1387
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,680
What happened?

1388
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,160
Come inside.

1389
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,280
Could we talk about
Buck's funeral?

1390
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,920
What?

1391
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,000
It'll seem trivial.
But it's on my mind.

1392
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:30,040
I'd like to talk about it.

1393
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:34,040
When I was getting dressed
for Buck's funeral...

1394
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:37,560
What could getting dressed
for Buck's funeral...

1395
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,120
have to do with anything?

1396
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,800
I was wearing a blue shirt.

1397
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,440
You said. "Wear a white shirt
and other shoes."

1398
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:52,600
It was nothing. But
it seemed to stay with me.

1399
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:55,160
What difference did it make...

1400
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:58,280
what I wore to Buck's funeral?

1401
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,320
Hear me out. Beth!

1402
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,440
No one would listen to that.

1403
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,400
I just want to talk about it.

1404
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,360
Why do you want to remind me?

1405
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:14,240
Because I've wondered what
it mattered what I wore.

1406
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,800
I was crazy that day.

1407
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,960
We were going
to our son's funeral.

1408
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:27,200
You were worried about
what I wore on my feet.

1409
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:30,080
It sticks with me...

1410
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:33,760
and I wanted to
tell you about it.

1411
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,400
It's all right.

1412
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,880
Beth! How are you?

1413
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,920
Fine. How are you?

1414
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I haven't seen you.

1415
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,560
I'll call you. How's Brad?

1416
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:14,120
Fabulous! Is everything okay?

1417
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,720
Isn't this madness?

1418
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:18,280
It gets worse every year.

1419
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,840
Good-bye.

May I show you this?

1423
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,160
Oh. No. No. Thanks.

Bennetts. Grants. And Foleys.

1425

Conrad should get something
for my parents.

1426
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,600
He's not getting something
for his doctor. Is he?

1427
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,920
We should go see Dr. Berger.

1428
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,240
What?

1429
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:03,280
We could all go see him.

1430
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,720
Why?

1431
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,760
He thinks it's a good idea.

1432
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,320
What's he know about me?

1433
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:13,040
I've never even met him.

1434
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:17,800
Wouldn't it be easier
if we all talked about it?

1435
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,360
What will we talk about?

1436
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,960
Don't try to change me.

1437
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,480
Hasn't enough happened?

1438
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:28,160
Let's hold on to what we've got.

1439
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,640
That's what this is for.

1440
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,120
Maybe you'll be surprised.

1441
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,880
I don't want surprises.

1442
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,760
I know I'm not perfect.

1443
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:42,440
If I can't hug everybody
like you. I'm sorry.

1444
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,840
You're missing the point.

1445
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,960
I don't want to see counselors.

1446
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,520
This is my family.

1447
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,560
We will solve our problems...

1448
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:56,160
in the privacy of our own home...

1449
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,760
not by running to some...

1450
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,400
Ready to order?

1451
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:04,000
Could you give me
a few minutes?

1452
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:08,120
Running to experts every time
something goes wrong.

1453
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,200
I know you mean well.

1454
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:19,920
I want this to be
a nice Christmas.

1455
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,480
I want them all to be nice.

1456
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:26,880
You and I need time together.

1457
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,400
We must get away.

1458
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:32,800
New Years'. We'll spend
time in Houston...

1459
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,320
with my brother.

1460
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,960
Play some golf. Relax.

1461
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,920
I've talked to Mother.

1462
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,480
Conrad can stay with them.

1463
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,120
Please don't worry about it.

1464
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:48,440
Please. For his sake.
Don't indulge him.

1465
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:51,000
We need time together.

1466
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:52,680
Okay?

1467
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,440
Okay.

1468
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,640
Okay.

1469
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,360
I love you.

1470
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,960
I love you. Too.

1471
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:11,320
Let's just give things time. Okay?

1472
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,720
Okay.

1473
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,320
Conrad.

1474
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,440
Hmm?

1475
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,160
I don't bowl.

1476
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,920
I'm a horrible bowler.

1477
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,440
That's all right.

1478
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,720
Yeah. Well...

1479
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,880
I got it.

1480
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:39,400
The thing is.
I'm a funny bowler.

1481
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,440
Listen. We don't
have to go bowling.

1482
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,880
I'm not a bowling nut.

1483
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,520
How funny are you?

1484
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:50,920
On a scale from 1 to 10...
About a 10.

1485
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,400
That's pretty funny.

1486
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,880
I promise you won't look silly.

1487
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,600
Guarantee it?

1488
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,000
Guarantee it.

1489
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:26,320
Can you break the ball?

1490
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,920
Can't break anything
in a bowling alley.

1491
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,880
That's what I like
about bowling alleys.

1492
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,120
Can't even break the record.

1493
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,360
Anyway...

1494
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,240
Hmm? What?

1495
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,600
It's a conversation starter.

1496
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:50,960
Catchy.

1497
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,280
You like it?

1498
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:56,040
I've been working on it all day.

1499
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:59,600
Are people punished
for things they do?

1500
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,120
By God?

1501
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,160
Yeah.

1502
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,720
I don't believe in God.

1503
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,280
Not at all?

1504
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,720
Either you do or don't.

1505
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,960
I believe in God.

1506
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:15,360
You afraid he'll punish you
for something?

1507
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:19,400
I've done many things
I'm ashamed of.

1508
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,440
Yeah? So have I.

1509
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,280
Did it hurt?

1510
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,280
I don't remember really.

1511
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,800
You don't want
to talk about it?

1512
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,960
I've never really
talked about it.

1513
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:52,640
To doctors.
But not to anyone else.

1514
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:54,120
You're the first who's asked.

1515
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:56,800
Why did you do it?

1516
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,240
Uh...

1517
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,880
I don't know.
It was like...

1518
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,920
falling into a hole.

1519
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:13,520
It was like falling into a hole.

1520
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,600
It keeps getting bigger...

1521
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,640
and you can't escape.

1522
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:21,080
All of a sudden, it's inside...

1523
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:22,760
and you're the hole.

1524
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,920
You're trapped.
And it's all over.

1525
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,880
Something like that.

1526
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:29,920
It's not really scary...

1527
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,600
except when
you think back on it.

1528
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:37,040
'Cause you know
what you were feeling...

1529
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,480
# Like McDonald's can #

1530
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,960
# Nobody can do it #

1531
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,680
# Like McDonald's can #

1532
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:46,560
# You deserve
a break today #

1533
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,560
# So get up
and get away #

1534
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,400
Hey. Jarrett.

1535
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:54,560
How you doing?
How about some fries?

1536
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:56,520
What are you doing?

1537
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,960
Hey. Lighten up.

1538
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:04,120
Hey. I don't like your attitude.

1539
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,400
Energetic. Those guys.

1540
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,360
They were pretty funny.

1541
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:35,880
No.

1542
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,960
You thought they were.

1543
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:39,480
No. L...

1544
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,280
I'm sorry.

1545
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,800
What for?

1546
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:57,440
Anyway...

1547
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,880
Do you want to talk?

1548
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:17,440
About what?

1549
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,000
Are you okay?

1550
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,520
Yeah.

1551
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,080
Yeah. I'm fine.

1552
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:28,120
I'll give you a call.

1553
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:31,400
Will you? I want you to.

1554
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,400
Sure.

1555
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,000
Well...

1556
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:46,560
I'll see you in choir.

1557
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,080
Okay. Yeah.

1558
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:50,320
Thanks.

1559
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,200
Okay.

1560
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:54,760
I mean. Good night.

1561
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,320
Good night.

Seven.

1563
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:13,720
In preparation
for our landing in Houston,

1564
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,800
observe the fasten
seat belt sign,

1565
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:20,040
and no smoking until
well inside the terminal.

1566
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,520
Watch this.

1567
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,040
Pessimistic golfer.

1568
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,600
Pessimistic golfer.

01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,200
Oh. Damn!

1570
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,160
Are we two up?

1571
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,760
Two.

1572
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,320
Let's hustle up.

1573
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,360
It is flat here.

1574
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:50,560
But we decided
to teach you to love it.

He wants everybody to move here.

1576
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,280
It's good to see you.

01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:59,560
- You look tired. Cal.
- Airplane scotch.

1578
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,280
Why am I still hungry?

1579
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,240
'Cause you're in Texas.

1580
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,280
We'll get you home.

1581
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,360
Get some steaks on.

1582
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,560
A baked potato. Too?

1583
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:14,200
How long has he had
that drawl?

1584
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,320
Since joining the club.

It sure wasn't funny.

We weren't that bad.

1588
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:12,880
I can't listen to that
Buck Jarrett lecture again.

1589
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:16,480
He bugs me
when he does that.

1590
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:20,120
Will he ever stop
kissing his picture?

1591
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,640
Stillman. Shut up.

1592
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,080
Connie. Want a ride?

1593
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:26,640
Oh. No. Thanks.

1594
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:29,200
We could've used you today.

1595
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,280
I don't think so.

1596
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:34,320
Nobody could've helped us.

1597
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:37,400
I hear you got eyes for Pratt.

1598
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:39,240
Made it with her yet?

1599
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:40,720
Don't be a prick.

1600
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,880
You're the prick.

1601
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,520
You give me a goddamn
pain in the ass.

1602
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,560
Connie. Come on!
Come on!

No!

No!

01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:07,000
Let go! Let go!

1608
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,440
It's all right!

1609
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,920
Just calm down.

You're crazy!
You know that?

1611
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,440
Send him back
where he came from!

It's over. It's over.

Here's your hat.

You want to talk?

The guy's a nothing.

1618
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,040
He's a zero upstairs.

1619
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:58,080
Since fourth grade,
you've known that.

1620
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:00,120
So you look stupid...

1621
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:03,160
when you let him get to you!

So I look stupid?

What's with you?

1624
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:11,920
Why do you want
to be in this alone?

01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,240
You know. I miss him. Too.

The three of us
were best friends.

to be around you.

01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,800
Good. You're here.

1684
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,320
Something happened.

1685
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,840
Just a minute.

1686
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,400
Wait till we get inside.

1687
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,480
There.

1688
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,640
Shit.

1689
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:48,400
You'd think they'd assume
there'd be emergencies.

1690
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,320
Don't take it off.
Just sit down.

1691
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:56,000
Something happened.

1692
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,120
What?

1693
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,600
It's...

1694
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,080
It's what?

1695
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:01,600
Oh. God!

1696
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:04,760
I need something.

1697
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:05,960
What?

1698
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:07,520
It keeps coming.

1699
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:09,480
I can't stop it!

1700
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,160
Don't try.

1701
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:13,760
Got to get off the hook.

1702
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,440
For what?

1703
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,600
What I did to him!

1704
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:18,800
What?

1705
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,320
It must be somebody's fault...

1706
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,560
or there's no point!

1707
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:25,640
What point? It happened!

1708
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:28,760
Oh. No. I don't mean that.

1709
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:30,320
It's just that...

1710
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,920
Bucky. I didn't mean it.

1711
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Bucky, I didn't mean it.

1712
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,880
Bucky!

1713
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:38,960
It wasn't your fault.

1714
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,360
You said. "Get the sail down!"

1715
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,560
I couldn't! It jammed!

1716
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:45,320
And then the halyard jammed!

1717
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:47,320
Because the goddamned
halyard jammed!

1718
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:50,320
Then you're sittin' here
screwing around!

1719
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,120
Until it's too late!

1720
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:55,360
And I'm supposed
to take care of it!

1721
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,640
That wasn't fair.

1722
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:59,640
No! And then
you say. "Hang on!"

1723
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:00,800
"Hang on!"

1724
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,520
Then you let go!

1725
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,120
Why'd you let go?

1726
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,440
I got tired!

1727
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,160
Yeah? Well. Screw you. You jerk!

1728
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:24,040
It hurts to be mad at him.

1729
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:25,560
Yeah.

1730
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,880
He just wasn't careful.

1731
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:33,840
He didn't see how
a bad thing might happen.

1732
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:37,680
Bad things happen even
when people are careful.

1733
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,680
We should've come in...

1734
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,360
when it started to look bad.

1735
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,760
So you made a mistake.

1736
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:47,120
Why did he let go?

1737
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:48,680
Why?

1738
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:51,800
Maybe you were stronger.

1739
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:55,120
Did that ever occur to you?

1740
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:06,080
How long will you
punish yourself?

1741
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:07,280
When will you quit?

1742
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,040
I'd like to.

1743
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:10,440
Why don't you?

1744
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:13,240
It's not that easy.

1745
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,280
God...

1746
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,320
I loved him.

1747
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,440
I know.

1748
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:47,160
What happened?
What started all this?

1749
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:48,720
Karen.

1750
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,800
She killed herself.

1751
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:55,920
I just found out she's dead.

1752
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,040
Jesus.

1753
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:00,320
She was fine.

1754
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,720
No. She wasn't.

1755
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:06,280
She told me!
She said she was...

1756
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:07,320
What?

1757
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:10,160
She was busy and
feeling good and...

1758
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:11,280
What?

1759
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,240
What?

1760
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,720
If I'd known...

1761
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,280
I could've done something.

1762
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:20,160
You're taking her on. Too?

1763
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:21,160
No!

1764
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:22,160
No?

1765
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,680
No. I just...

1766
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:24,680
What?

1767
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:26,200
That isn't it.

1768
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:29,360
I feel really bad about this.

1769
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:32,760
Just let me feel bad about this!

1770
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:35,240
Okay.

1771
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,800
Listen. I feel
bad about it. Too.

1772
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:47,360
Why do things
happen to people?

1773
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,840
It isn't fair.

1774
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:52,600
You're right.
It isn't fair.

1775
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:55,080
You just do one wrong thing...

1776
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:56,600
and...

1777
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:59,280
Um-hmm.

1778
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:03,200
And what was the one
wrong thing you did?

1779
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,640
You know.

1780
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:26,400
You know.

1781
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,320
I hung on.

1782
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:34,520
I stayed with the boat.

1783
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:36,200
Exactly.

1784
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:45,920
Now. You can live
with that. Can't you?

1785
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,040
I'm scared!

1786
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:56,320
I'm scared.

1787
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:58,600
Feelings are scary.

1788
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:00,760
And sometimes they're painful.

1789
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:03,120
If you can't feel pain...

1790
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:06,160
you won't feel
anything else.

1791
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,840
You know what I'm saying?

1792
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:13,520
I think so.

1793
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,200
You're here. You're alive.

1794
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:21,080
Don't say you don't feel that.

1795
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:23,360
It doesn't feel good.

1796
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,880
It is good.

1797
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,400
Believe me.

1798
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,680
How do you know?

1799
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:36,960
Because I'm your friend.

1800
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:44,680
I don't know
what I would've done...

1801
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:47,200
if you hadn't been here.

1802
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:53,480
You're really my friend?

1803
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,400
I am. Count on it.

1804
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:52,600
Hi.

1805
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,080
I would've called...

1806
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:57,080
but I didn't
want to wake anyone.

1807
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:58,600
About the other night...

1808
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,120
I liked being with you.

1809
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:03,600
I didn't like myself.

1810
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:05,600
Conrad. I was stupid.

1811
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:08,600
That was dumb of me to laugh.

1812
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:10,600
It was my fault.

1813
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:12,720
I was embarrassed.

1814
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:13,960
Really?

1815
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,760
You were embarrassed?

1816
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,080
When those boys came in...

1817
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:20,640
it was awful and awkward.

1818
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:23,000
When I'm embarrassed. I laugh.

1819
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:26,360
They were just having
a good time.

1820
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:30,400
I let them interfere
with what was happening.

1821
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:31,920
It was dumb.

1822
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,520
I've done lots of
dumb things lately.

1823
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:40,320
I just didn't know if you were
being straight with me.

1824
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:44,920
Yeah?

1825
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,360
Anyway. I'd like
to try it again.

1826
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:49,840
It worked okay...

1827
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,040
except for the bowling.

1828
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:53,600
Yes.

1829
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:55,520
Yes?

1830
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:58,680
Yes.

1831
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:02,240
Are you going to school?

1832
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:05,160
No. Not on Sunday.

1833
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Have you eaten?

1834
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,080
No. I haven't.

1835
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:14,600
Do you want some breakfast?

1836
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,000
Okay.

1837
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,040
Mom!

1838
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:37,280
All right.
How about that?

1839
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:38,800
Boy. Oh. Boy.

1840
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,840
I do love that.

1841
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:43,880
These holes sure do love you.

1842
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:47,960
We should spend more time
playing golf together.

1843
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:51,000
Maybe our next vacation...
strictly golf.

1844
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:52,560
Pinehurst.
Myrtle Beach.

1845
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:54,600
Pinehurst would be nice.

1846
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:57,640
I think Connie would
like Pinehurst.

1847
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:01,160
Is that deliberate
or just a reflex?

1848
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:04,240
I assumed you meant him. Too.

1849
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:07,280
I'm surprised you
haven't called him.

1850
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,320
I'll call him tonight.

1851
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:12,400
Can we have a little drink?

1852
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:14,440
Drink. Yes. Little. No.

1853
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:15,960
Let's finish this.

1854
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:16,960
What?

1855
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:18,520
What you started.

1856
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,560
Me? There's no point.

1857
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,080
He controls you.

1858
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:24,120
He isn't the problem.

1859
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:25,640
Isn't he?

1860
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:29,120
No. Let's talk about
what's bothering you.

1861
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:32,160
No. Let's discuss
what's bothering you.

1862
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:36,240
How did I make you
so angry with me?

1863
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,800
You blame me
for everything.

1864
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:41,320
Can't you see
beyond yourself?

1865
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:42,880
No. I can't!

1866
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:45,920
Neither can you
or anybody else!

1867
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,440
I'm just honest.

1868
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:48,960
Stop being honest...

1869
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:51,000
and start being generous!

1870
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:52,520
Think about him!

1871
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:55,560
What does he expect from me?

1872
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:59,640
He wants a hug
when he passes exams?

1873
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:02,720
I can't respond
when someone says...

1874
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,760
"I did something
great. Love me."

1875
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:09,800
He wants to know
you don't hate him.

1876
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:12,400
Mothers don't hate their sons.

1877
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:15,440
Is that what he told you?

1878
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:19,480
You accept what he says
with no questions.

1879
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:22,560
I'm trying to
keep this family...

1880
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:25,600
What does everyone
want from me?

1881
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:30,120
Listen. We all just
want you to be happy.

1882
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:31,640
Happy?

1883
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:32,680
Yes.

1884
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:36,440
You tell me
the definition of happy.

1885
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:39,800
First. Be sure your kids are safe...

1886
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:43,360
that nobody's been hit by a car...

1887
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:46,400
or drowned in your swimming pool!

1888
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:50,000
Then tell me how to be happy!

1889
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:46,000
I'm turning in.

1890
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:47,520
Dinner was good.

1891
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:49,040
Really good.

1892
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:51,560
It's early. You tired?

1893
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:53,880
It was a rough week.

1894
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:57,680
Your grandmother
wasn't too tough on you?

1895
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:59,720
No. She was fine.

1896
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,840
I'm glad you're back.

1897
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,640
Good night.

1898
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:43,840
[Sobbing]

1899
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:52,000
Calvin?

1900
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:05,840
Why are you crying?

1901
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:14,160
Can I. Uh...

1902
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,720
Can I get you something?

1903
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:20,280
I don't...

1904
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:22,320
What did you say?

1905
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:28,760
Calvin. What did you say?

1906
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:30,360
[Sighing]

1907
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:35,520
Tell me.

1908
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:43,640
You are beautiful.

1909
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:49,720
And you are unpredictable.

1910
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,800
But you're so cautious.

1911
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:57,840
You're determined. Beth...

1912
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:00,040
but you know something?

1913
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:03,960
You're not strong.

1914
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:09,320
I don't know
if you're really giving.

1915
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:14,000
Tell me something.

1916
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:16,160
Do you love me?

1917
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:20,720
Do you really love me?

1918
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:26,920
I feel the way I've always
felt about you.

1919
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:42,040
We would've been all right...

1920
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:45,600
if there hadn't been any mess.

1921
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:49,680
But you can't handle mess.

1922
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:54,720
You need everything neat and easy.

1923
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,320
I don't know.

1924
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:59,840
Maybe you can't love anybody.

1925
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:02,360
It was so much Buck.

1926
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:07,440
It's as if you buried
all your love with him.

1927
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:09,480
I don't understand that.

1928
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:14,560
Maybe it wasn't even Buck.

1929
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:17,040
Maybe it was just you.

1930
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:22,760
Maybe, finally, it was
the best of you that you buried.

1931
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:27,320
But whatever it was...

1932
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:33,920
I don't know who you are.

1933
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:38,480
I don't know what
we've been playing at.

1934
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:43,200
So I was crying.

1935
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:51,800
Because I don't know
if I love you anymore.

1936
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:59,320
And I don't know
what I'll do without that.

1937
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:30,040
[Door Slams]

1938
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:31,680
Dad?

1939
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:37,920
The yard looks smaller
without leaves.

1940
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:40,960
Dad. What happened?

1941
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:46,560
Your mother's
going away for a while.

1942
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:47,800
Where?

1943
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:49,080
Why?

1944
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:50,640
Back to Houston.

1945
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:53,160
I don't know.

1946
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:55,720
Why? What...

1947
01:58:57,800 --> 01:58:59,280
I know why.

1948
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:01,320
It's me. Isn't it?

1949
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:02,360
No.

1950
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,840
It's my fault.

1951
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:06,200
Don't do that to yourself!

1952
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:07,680
It's nobody's fault!

1953
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:11,160
Things happen.
People don't always have answers.

1954
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:18,760
I don't know why
I'm yelling at you.

1955
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:21,920
You should do
that more often.

1956
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,720
Haul my ass a little.

1957
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:25,240
Get after me.

1958
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:29,400
Like you did for him.

1959
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:31,000
He needed it.

1960
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:32,000
You didn't.

1961
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:35,000
You were always
so hard on yourself.

1962
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:37,400
I never had the heart.

1963
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:40,000
Oh. Dad. Don't.

1964
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:42,320
Well. It's the truth.

1965
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:46,520
I never worried about you.

1966
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:49,520
I just wasn't listening.

1967
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:52,880
I wasn't sending
many signals then.

1968
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,880
You couldn't do anything.

1969
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:58,480
I should've got
a handle on it somehow.

1970
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:07,560
I used to figure you had
a handle for everything.

1971
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,840
You knew it all.

1972
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:13,920
You always made us feel
everything would be all right.

1973
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,960
I've thought about that
a lot lately.

1974
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:20,480
I really admire you for it.

1975
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:22,560
Don't admire people too much.

1976
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:25,720
They'll disappoint you sometimes.

1977
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:28,720
I'm not disappointed.

1978
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:34,480
I love you.

1979
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:41,520
I love you. Too.
