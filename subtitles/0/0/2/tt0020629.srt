1
00:00:00,352 --> 00:00:03,288
You can go out without
asking anyone.

2
00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:06,291
You can even play piano
if you want to.

3
00:00:10,364 --> 00:00:15,301
Oh... Oh, but, Franz, you must
try to sleep now.

4
00:00:31,387 --> 00:00:33,321
O God...

5
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,325
this is Franz Kemmerick...

6
00:00:37,394 --> 00:00:39,328
only 19 years old.

7
00:00:40,397 --> 00:00:42,331
He doesn't want to die.

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,335
Please don't let him die.

9
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:47,336
Paul.

10
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:49,339
- Paul.
- Franz.

11
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:54,345
Take my boots home
for Mueller.

12
00:00:55,414 --> 00:00:57,348
Oh, no, Franz, no.

13
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,285
And if... Paul...

14
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:06,291
you find my watch,
send it home.

15
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,291
Franz!

16
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:13,299
Doctor! Doctor!

17
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:15,301
Doctor!

18
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:18,304
Doctor! Where's the doctor?

19
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:21,308
Why isn't there a doctor here?

20
00:01:21,376 --> 00:01:23,310
Doctor, come quick!

21
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:25,312
- Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that?

22
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,314
- Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.

23
00:01:27,382 --> 00:01:29,317
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.

24
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:31,319
I'm due in the operating room.

25
00:01:32,388 --> 00:01:35,323
One operating after another since
5:00 this morning.

26
00:01:36,392 --> 00:01:39,328
Sixteen dead today, and
yours is the 17th.

27
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:41,330
There'll probably be 20
by the morning.

28
00:02:02,354 --> 00:02:05,290
You're looking good.
Very good today.

29
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,311
What's your hurry? Hey! I'll bet
he stole those boots!

30
00:02:27,382 --> 00:02:29,316
I got it, Kat.

31
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:34,322
Listen: "The sum of an
arithmetic series...

32
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,325
is S = A + L x N over 2."

33
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:39,328
Interesting, isn't it?

34
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:41,330
What do you wanna learn
that stuff for?

35
00:02:41,398 --> 00:02:44,333
One day you'll stop a bullet
and it'll all be worthless.

36
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:46,335
I get a lot of fun out of it.

37
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:07,293
My boots!

38
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:15,302
Mueller.

39
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:18,305
I saw him die.

40
00:03:22,377 --> 00:03:25,313
I didn't know what it was like
to die before.

41
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:29,317
And then... then I
came outside...

42
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:31,319
and it felt...

43
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:38,327
it felt so good to be alive that
I started in to walk fast.

44
00:03:39,396 --> 00:03:41,331
I began to think of the
strangest things...

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,334
like being out in the fields.

46
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:46,336
Things like that.

47
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:50,341
You know... girls.

48
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:54,345
And it felt as if
there were...

49
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:58,282
something electric running from
the ground up through me.

50
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:01,286
And I started. I began
to run hard.

51
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:04,289
I passed soldiers and I heard
voices calling to me.

52
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:06,291
I ran and I ran.

53
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,295
I felt as if I couldn't breathe
enough air into me.

54
00:04:12,366 --> 00:04:16,303
And... And now I'm hungry.

55
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,309
I don't mind the war now.

56
00:04:22,377 --> 00:04:25,313
Be a pleasure to go to the front
in boots like these.

57
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:19,306
It's a good invention
just the same.

58
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:23,310
If you crack each separate louse, think
of all the energy you use up. Watch.

59
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,315
Burned to death.

60
00:05:29,385 --> 00:05:31,319
How was patrol? Bad?

61
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:34,322
Must've been terrible if they had
time to gather the harvest.

62
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,326
We passed a cherry tree and when
he saw it, he went crazy.

63
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:39,328
I could hardly drag him away.

64
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:42,331
It was... beautiful.

65
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,336
I have a big orchard with cherry
trees at home.

66
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:50,340
When they're in full blossom...

67
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:53,344
from the hayloft it looks
like one single sheet.

68
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:56,347
So white.

69
00:05:58,351 --> 00:06:00,285
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent...

70
00:06:00,353 --> 00:06:02,288
back as a farmer.

71
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:06,292
A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know?

72
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,295
No matter how hard
she works.

73
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:13,300
Harvest coming on again.

74
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:16,303
What's the matter
with him?

75
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:20,308
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.

76
00:06:20,376 --> 00:06:23,311
We'd all like to get
back home.

77
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:25,313
I wonder what we'd do if it were
suddenly peacetime again?

78
00:06:25,381 --> 00:06:28,317
Get drunk and look
for women!

79
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:30,319
I'd go looking for
a Cinderella...

80
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:33,322
that could wear this
for a garter.

81
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,325
And when I'd found her, nobody'd
see me for two weeks.

82
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:40,330
I'll go back to the
peat fields...

83
00:06:40,398 --> 00:06:44,334
and those pleasant hours
in the beer gardens.

84
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:48,339
And there's worse things
than cobbling too.

85
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,342
Look. My family.

86
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,382
I oughta give you a kick in the
backside for starting all this.

87
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:01,285
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to.

88
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,289
Wives, children, jobs.

89
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:07,293
But what about us? What have
we got to go back to?

90
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:09,295
- School?
- Why not?

91
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:11,297
You know everything already.

92
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:14,301
A man can't take all that rubbish
they teach you seriously...

93
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:17,304
after three years of
shells and bombs.

94
00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:20,307
You can't peel that
off easily.

95
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:23,311
They never taught us anything
really useful...

96
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:26,314
like how to light a cigarette in the
wind or make a fire out of wet wood...

97
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:29,318
or bayonet a man in the belly instead
of the ribs where it gets jammed.

98
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:32,321
What can happen to us
afterwards?

99
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:35,324
I'll tell you. Take our class.

100
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:39,329
Out of 20, three are officers...

101
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:41,331
nine dead...

102
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,334
Mueller and three others
wounded...

103
00:07:44,402 --> 00:07:46,336
and one in the madhouse.

104
00:07:46,404 --> 00:07:49,340
We'll all be dead someday,
so let's forget it.

105
00:07:53,412 --> 00:07:55,346
Hurry up! Get in there!
Hurry up!

106
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,350
Himmelstoss!

107
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:07,360
What's up?

108
00:08:07,428 --> 00:08:10,363
- What are you, crazy?
- It's Himmelstoss!

109
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:14,368
Himmelstoss? There is justice
in the army!

110
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:20,374
Well, well. So, we are
all here, huh?

111
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:22,377
A bit longer than you,
Himmie.

112
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:24,379
Since when have we become
so familiar?

113
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:27,382
Stand up and click your heels
together! All of you!

114
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,387
- Take a running jump at yourself!
- Who's your friend?

115
00:08:31,455 --> 00:08:34,390
Would somebody get General
Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?

116
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:38,394
I command you as your
superior officer!

117
00:08:38,462 --> 00:08:40,397
- Do you want to be court-martialed?
- I do!

118
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:42,399
There's going to be a big
attack tonight...

119
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:45,402
and I'd just love to
get out of it.

120
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:49,407
Kiss my butt!

121
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,450
It isn't customary to ask for
salutes here.

122
00:08:57,451 --> 00:08:59,350
But I'll tell you what we'll do.

123
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:02,354
We're going to attack a town that
we tried to take once before.

124
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:04,356
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.

125
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:07,360
This time you're
going with us.

126
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:10,363
If any of us stops a bullet,
before we die...

127
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:13,366
we're going to come to you, click
our heels together and ask stiffly...

128
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:15,369
"Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss,
may we go?"

129
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:17,371
You'll...

130
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:19,373
You'll pay for this,
you...

131
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:26,381
There it is.

132
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:33,389
Right on time. Better
get ready, boys.

133
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:33,388
I'm wounded!
I'm wounded!

134
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:37,393
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat!
Up! Get out with the others!

135
00:10:37,461 --> 00:10:39,395
- Up!
- No! No! No!

136
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:42,398
You yellow rat!

137
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:45,402
Stinking yellow rat! Let the
others do it, eh?

138
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,405
Get up!
Get up!

139
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:50,407
Get up! Forward!

140
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:55,413
- Get out here.
- Command... was forward.

141
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:00,353
Command was forward!

142
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:02,355
Forward!

143
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:06,359
Forward! Forward!

144
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:10,364
Forward!

145
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:13,367
Forward!

146
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:57,416
Counterattack.

147
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:32,388
I want to help you.

148
00:15:32,456 --> 00:15:34,391
I want to help you.

149
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:31,387
Stop that! Stop it, stop it.

150
00:16:31,455 --> 00:16:36,393
I can bear the rest of it.
I can't listen to that!

151
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,407
Why do you take so long dying?
You're going to die anyway!

152
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:52,410
Oh, no.

153
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:57,450
Oh, no. You won't die.

154
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:01,354
Oh, no. You won't die. They're
only little wounds.

155
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:04,357
You'll get home. You'll be
all right.

156
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:07,360
You'll get home long
before I will.

157
00:18:10,498 --> 00:18:13,434
You know I can't run away. That's
why you accuse me.

158
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:18,439
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
I tried to keep you alive.

159
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:22,444
If you jumped in here again,
I wouldn't do it.

160
00:18:22,512 --> 00:18:27,449
When you jumped in here you were my
enemy, and I was afraid of you.

161
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:31,454
But you're just a man like me,
and I killed you.

162
00:18:32,523 --> 00:18:34,457
Forgive me, comrade.

163
00:18:35,526 --> 00:18:38,462
Say that for me. Say you
forgive me.

164
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:42,466
Oh, no. You're dead.

165
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:47,472
You're better off than I am.
You're through.

166
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,474
They can't do any more
to you now.

167
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:54,479
Oh, God, why did they
do this to us?

168
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:57,483
We only wanted to live,
you and I.

169
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:01,420
Why should they send us out
to fight each other?

170
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:04,424
If we threw away these rifles
and these uniforms...

171
00:19:04,492 --> 00:19:07,427
you could be my brother just
like Kat and Albert.

172
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:11,431
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.

173
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:15,436
I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to...

174
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:45,469
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.

175
00:19:46,538 --> 00:19:49,474
I promise she'll not want
for anything.

176
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:52,477
I'll help her and your
parents too.

177
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:56,482
Only forgive me.
Forgive me!

178
00:19:58,486 --> 00:20:00,420
Forgive me. Forgive me.

179
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:02,422
Forgive me.

180
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:49,475
Terrible thing happened
yesterday.

181
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:53,479
I stabbed a man. With my own
hands, stabbed him.

182
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:57,516
I know how it is.
Your first time.

183
00:20:57,517 --> 00:21:00,419
Never mind. The stretcher-bearers
will find him.

184
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:04,424
- He's dead. I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it.

185
00:21:04,492 --> 00:21:07,428
We have to kill. We
can't help it.

186
00:21:07,496 --> 00:21:12,433
That's what we are here for.
Look there, for instance.

187
00:21:14,503 --> 00:21:17,439
That got him. You should've seen how
he leaped in the air.

188
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:22,444
That fellow had to shoot with us
for today with three hits.

189
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:25,448
If he keeps it up, he'll have a
decoration for his...

190
00:21:25,516 --> 00:21:27,450
buttonhole this evening.

191
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:30,453
Don't you lose any more sleep
over this business.

192
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:34,458
Maybe it was because I was out
there with him so long, huh?

193
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,460
Sure, that's it.

194
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,463
After all, war is war.

195
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:15,436
March! Forward!

196
00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:17,439
Forward, march!

197
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:32,455
Quick there! Forward!

198
00:22:34,525 --> 00:22:36,460
Company... halt!

199
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:39,463
Dismissed!

200
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:43,468
Uncommissioned officers,
enlisted men...

201
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:45,470
dismiss!

202
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,473
Come on! Let's get outta here!

203
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:19,442
- Give me your best sausage.
- Two.

204
00:23:21,512 --> 00:23:23,446
Give me a beer.

205
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:33,457
One, two, three!

206
00:23:39,532 --> 00:23:41,466
Hey, come on. A beer.

207
00:23:44,537 --> 00:23:46,472
Hey, get out of here!

208
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,474
Come on. Give me a beer.

209
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:54,481
A beer. One b...

210
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:04,425
here's hoping we get falling-down
drunk tonight.

211
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:06,427
Here's how it started.

212
00:24:22,513 --> 00:24:24,447
I'd forgotten there were
girls like that.

213
00:24:24,515 --> 00:24:26,449
There aren't.

214
00:24:27,518 --> 00:24:30,454
Just look at those thin,
little shoes.

215
00:24:30,522 --> 00:24:32,456
She couldn't march many
miles in those.

216
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:38,463
Paul! Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.

217
00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:42,467
A thousand pardons.

218
00:24:44,537 --> 00:24:49,475
- How old you think she is?
- Oh, about 22.

219
00:24:49,543 --> 00:24:52,478
No, that'd make her
older than us.

220
00:24:54,548 --> 00:24:56,483
She's... 17.

221
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:01,421
A girl like that.

222
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:03,423
That'd be good,
Albert?

223
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:11,432
We wouldn't have much of a
chance with him around.

224
00:25:27,518 --> 00:25:30,454
We could take a bath wash
our clothes...

225
00:25:30,522 --> 00:25:31,454
All right.

226
00:25:31,523 --> 00:25:34,458
And I might even go so far
as to get deloused.

227
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:38,462
Wait a minute! She's a long way
from here now.

228
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,466
Look at the date.
May, 1917.

229
00:25:41,534 --> 00:25:44,469
- Four months ago.
- That's true.

230
00:25:44,537 --> 00:25:48,474
Well, here's to her anyway.

231
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:51,477
Here's to them all,
everywhere.

232
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:56,481
Albert...

233
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,420
- We might as well wash up anyway.
- All right.

234
00:26:04,492 --> 00:26:07,428
Personally, I like them
bigger around.

235
00:26:07,496 --> 00:26:10,431
This conversation was on a high
moral plane up to now.

236
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:12,433
Now we do need a bath.

237
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:15,437
- A bath?
- For what?

238
00:26:17,507 --> 00:26:19,441
You wouldn't understand.

239
00:26:24,366 --> 00:26:27,302
This water is freezing. This romantic
business has gone too far.

240
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,305
Ahh, but think of her
beautiful eyes!

241
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:32,309
Oh, and her hair.

242
00:26:33,378 --> 00:26:35,312
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing!

243
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,312
Go away!

244
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:38,316
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing!

245
00:26:38,384 --> 00:26:42,253
They tell me there's some people in
this world takes a bath every week!

246
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:45,259
Women!

247
00:27:00,347 --> 00:27:02,281
Mademoiselle, you want to swim?

248
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:17,301
Mademoiselle!

249
00:27:40,365 --> 00:27:42,266
Aw, baby!

250
00:27:43,336 --> 00:27:46,272
Aw, no, girls! Don't go away!

251
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,274
Aw, mama!

252
00:27:56,353 --> 00:27:59,289
- Please don't go!
- Don't go away!

253
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:13,307
Food! Food!

254
00:28:36,406 --> 00:28:39,341
Halt! You know you're forbidden
to cross.

255
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:41,275
You fellows stay on this side
or you'll get...

256
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,279
yourselves in a lot of trouble.

257
00:28:57,366 --> 00:28:59,300
What are they jabbering
about?

258
00:28:59,368 --> 00:29:01,303
They want us to swing over tonight.
They're expecting us.

259
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,306
- That's fine!
- We'll do it!

260
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,308
That blonde's crazy about me.

261
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,311
But there's four of us and
only three of them.

262
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,313
I was the one that
stopped them!

263
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:12,318
That blonde piece of work is mine.
You three fight for what's left.

264
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:16,323
Fight's the word. All's fair
in love and war.

265
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:18,325
What do you mean? What're
you gonna do?

266
00:29:19,395 --> 00:29:21,330
You'll find out.
Au revoir!

267
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:23,332
Au revoir!

268
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:45,295
- C'est moi, blondie!
- Bon ami! Bon ami!

269
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:48,299
Vos camarades!
Vos camarades!

270
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,305
She means the door.

271
00:30:15,402 --> 00:30:18,338
Not only modest, but dashing!
A perfect fit.

272
00:30:18,406 --> 00:30:21,342
It might've been made for me.
An officer's coat.

273
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,345
We're calling distinguished
company.

274
00:31:00,394 --> 00:31:02,328
Merci.

275
00:31:34,438 --> 00:31:36,373
Have another little drink,
comrade.

276
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:41,312
Is this your birthday
or mine?

277
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:43,315
Why?

278
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:48,321
You've been buying me drink
after drink for two hours.

279
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,326
What I'm trying to figure
out is why.

280
00:31:53,396 --> 00:31:55,331
Why?

281
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:57,334
Why?

282
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:06,346
Oh. I it's just that the boys...

283
00:32:06,414 --> 00:32:11,352
told me to amuse you
for a little while.

284
00:32:12,421 --> 00:32:15,357
Oh, nice boys.

285
00:32:16,427 --> 00:32:19,362
They... They said you'd
understand.

286
00:32:27,441 --> 00:32:29,375
I've been betrayed!

287
00:32:30,444 --> 00:32:33,381
Yeah, you certainly have.

288
00:32:33,449 --> 00:32:35,383
Take that for a minute!

289
00:32:35,451 --> 00:32:37,386
I'll give you more!

290
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:50,336
It's too loud.

291
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,375
Suzanne. And I wouldn't even
know you if I did.

292
00:33:21,444 --> 00:33:27,386
And yet, I'll remember
you always.

293
00:33:29,455 --> 00:33:30,387
Toujours.

294
00:33:31,457 --> 00:33:34,394
Oh, if you could only know how
different this is...

295
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:36,396
from the women we
soldiers meet.

296
00:33:39,468 --> 00:33:41,402
You. That's what I'm
talking about. Vous.

297
00:33:44,475 --> 00:33:48,412
It seems as though all war and
terror and grossness...

298
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,414
had fallen away from me...

299
00:33:51,484 --> 00:33:53,419
like a miracle.

300
00:33:54,488 --> 00:33:56,422
Like something I never believed.

301
00:33:57,491 --> 00:34:00,428
Pauvre garon.
Pauvre garon.

302
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,432
Frau Paul.

303
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,435
We're going, Paul.

304
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:35,474
Have a look. Nice, new coffins.
Huh! For us.

305
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:40,515
I must say, that's a very cheerful
preparation for this offensive.

306
00:34:40,516 --> 00:34:43,416
That's very considerate of them.
But I don't see any long...

307
00:34:43,485 --> 00:34:45,421
enough for our comrade Tjaden.

308
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:49,426
Mind you, I'm not speaking
to you, you traitors.

309
00:34:49,494 --> 00:34:54,432
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.

310
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,436
You'll be thankful if they slip
a waterproof sheet...

311
00:34:57,504 --> 00:35:00,440
around that Aunt Sally of a
carcass of yours.

312
00:35:30,548 --> 00:35:32,482
Oh... Oh, my side!

313
00:35:36,555 --> 00:35:38,490
My side.

314
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:14,470
Catholic hospital,
Albert.

315
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:18,475
They say you always get good
food and good treatment.

316
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:22,481
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station...

317
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:25,484
and 24 hours on the train, we
deserve to have some luck.

318
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:32,494
I'm Hamacher.

319
00:36:36,566 --> 00:36:38,502
Yeah, that's my name.

320
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:42,439
I got a crack in the head and they
gave me a certificate stating...

321
00:36:42,508 --> 00:36:45,443
"Josef Hamacher is
periodically...

322
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:48,448
not responsible for
his actions."

323
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:54,455
And ever since then, Hamacher has
been having a grand time.

324
00:37:03,535 --> 00:37:07,472
I hope you boys are not too
badly wounded.

325
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:12,478
The others die off so quickly we
don't have time to get acquainted.

326
00:37:13,548 --> 00:37:16,484
You'll get to know us...
very well.

327
00:37:17,553 --> 00:37:20,489
Thank you.
You too.

328
00:37:25,564 --> 00:37:30,502
I'm sorry, my dear. It's
time to go now.

329
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,505
Yes, sister.

330
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:41,449
Watch.

331
00:37:44,522 --> 00:37:48,458
If they take his clothes away,
you've seen the last of him.

332
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:51,463
See? They're taking him to
the dying room.

333
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:53,465
Dying room?

334
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:57,470
When you're ready to kick the
bucket, they get you out...

335
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:00,475
of the way so they can
use the bed.

336
00:38:00,543 --> 00:38:02,477
In the corner of the building
there's a little room...

337
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:04,480
right next to the morgue!

338
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:07,484
It's so convenient. It saves
a lot of trouble.

339
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:09,487
But suppose he gets well?

340
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:12,490
I've seen a lot of them go
in that dying room...

341
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:15,495
but nobody ever
comes back.

342
00:38:41,531 --> 00:38:42,463
Sister.

343
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:45,468
Sister. Sister.

344
00:38:54,547 --> 00:38:56,482
- Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Yes.

345
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:01,489
- Is something going on?
- I think I have a haemorrhage.

346
00:39:01,557 --> 00:39:05,493
The bandage is all wet. I've been
ringing forever and nobody comes.

347
00:39:06,563 --> 00:39:08,498
I think I'm bleeding.

348
00:39:08,566 --> 00:39:11,502
Sister, get me a sterile dressing
and an ice pack.

349
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,504
- Why didn't someone call me?
- He's been ringing.

350
00:39:13,572 --> 00:39:15,506
Nobody can walk, Sister.

351
00:39:15,574 --> 00:39:19,512
- Sister, is it bad?
- No. No, we'll be all right.

352
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,515
We've got it in time.

353
00:40:11,581 --> 00:40:14,517
What's the matter? What
are you doing?

354
00:40:14,585 --> 00:40:16,519
We must rearrange
your bandages.

355
00:40:19,592 --> 00:40:21,526
Where are you
taking me?

356
00:40:21,594 --> 00:40:23,529
To the bandaging ward.

357
00:40:30,606 --> 00:40:34,543
No, no! I'm not going!
I'm staying here!

358
00:40:34,611 --> 00:40:36,546
Paul! Paul!

359
00:40:36,614 --> 00:40:38,549
- Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!

360
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:40,586
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?

361
00:40:40,587 --> 00:40:44,489
You're lying to me! But I'll come
back. I won't die!

362
00:40:44,558 --> 00:40:46,492
I'll come back!
I won't die!

363
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,496
I'll come back!
I won't die!

364
00:40:49,564 --> 00:40:52,499
I'm not going to die!
I'll come back!

365
00:41:03,582 --> 00:41:05,517
Sister Libertine, how is he?

366
00:41:05,585 --> 00:41:08,520
Poor boy. They had to
amputate his leg.

367
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:27,545
Paul. Paul.

368
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:31,550
Paul.

369
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,552
Oh, he is...

370
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:35,555
gone.

371
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:37,558
Gone.

372
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,504
Hello. Welcome home,
Albert!

373
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:52,511
- How do you fell, kid?
- All right.

374
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:55,516
But I've got such
an awful pain.

375
00:41:55,584 --> 00:41:57,518
My foot hur...

376
00:42:01,591 --> 00:42:04,527
Hamacher. Did they cut
my leg off?

377
00:42:04,595 --> 00:42:08,532
Of course not! How many did
you have? Two?

378
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,535
You still got them!
One, two!

379
00:42:11,604 --> 00:42:15,542
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.

380
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,545
Of course not. And
you look fine.

381
00:42:21,618 --> 00:42:23,552
Look. See?

382
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,074
- I won't be a cripple.
- Now, now.

383
00:42:40,075 --> 00:42:42,510
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm.

384
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:44,513
I'll kill myself the first
chance I get!

385
00:42:44,581 --> 00:42:45,513
Albert!

386
00:42:45,582 --> 00:42:48,519
- I won't live! I won't live!
- Yes, you will.

387
00:42:48,587 --> 00:42:50,521
Albert! Albert!

388
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:53,525
Albert, I've come back!

389
00:42:53,593 --> 00:42:57,531
I told you I'd come back. Look,
everybody! I've come back!

390
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,533
Paul. Paul.

391
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:01,535
That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.

392
00:43:01,603 --> 00:43:03,538
Paul, I'm so happy.

393
00:43:03,606 --> 00:43:06,542
Hamacher, I've come back
from the dead!

394
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:08,545
It's most irregular. Never
happened before.

395
00:43:08,613 --> 00:43:10,547
Albert, get well quickly...

396
00:43:10,615 --> 00:43:12,550
so we can go home soon.

397
00:43:12,618 --> 00:43:15,554
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul.

398
00:43:15,622 --> 00:43:17,557
Everything will be all right...
now.

399
00:44:49,678 --> 00:44:52,614
Oh! Paul! Paul!

400
00:44:55,686 --> 00:44:56,618
Paul.

401
00:44:57,688 --> 00:45:00,625
- What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.

402
00:45:00,693 --> 00:45:01,625
Nothing.

403
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:25,656
Paul.

404
00:45:25,725 --> 00:45:27,660
Give me your hanky chief.

405
00:45:37,741 --> 00:45:41,610
- Mother?
- Here I am, Paul. Here I am.

406
00:45:44,683 --> 00:45:46,618
Mother's ill.

407
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:07,645
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother. I got leave.

408
00:46:15,723 --> 00:46:18,660
Here I am crying instead
of being glad.

409
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,666
Anna, get down the jar
of blackberries.

410
00:46:23,734 --> 00:46:26,669
You still like them,
don't you?

411
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:31,676
Yes, Mother. I haven't had
any for a long time.

412
00:46:34,748 --> 00:46:37,685
We might almost have known
you were coming.

413
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:41,621
- I'm making potato cakes.
- Don't let them burn.

414
00:46:43,694 --> 00:46:45,629
Paul... sit down...

415
00:46:45,697 --> 00:46:47,632
beside me.

416
00:46:51,704 --> 00:46:53,639
My Paul.

417
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:57,645
My baby.

418
00:47:00,716 --> 00:47:04,654
I almost forgot, Mother. I've got
some little presents for you.

419
00:47:19,741 --> 00:47:23,679
Look, Mother. Bread,
sausage and rice.

420
00:47:23,747 --> 00:47:26,682
Paul, you've been starving
yourself.

421
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,687
Hadn't I better go and tell
father Paul's home?

422
00:47:29,755 --> 00:47:32,690
Paul could watch the things
on the stove.

423
00:47:32,758 --> 00:47:34,693
No, I'm getting up.

424
00:47:34,761 --> 00:47:38,699
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now,
aren't you?

425
00:47:39,768 --> 00:47:43,636
But somehow, I don't seem
to know you.

426
00:47:44,707 --> 00:47:46,642
I'll take these off,
mother.

427
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:49,646
I'll get your suit. It's in the
wardrobe, just where you left it.

428
00:47:49,714 --> 00:47:52,649
Are you really here,
Paul?

429
00:47:52,717 --> 00:47:54,652
You won't...

430
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,656
You won't disappear,
will you?

431
00:47:58,725 --> 00:48:01,661
No. I'm here.

432
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,686
Your things are ready
for you, Paul.

433
00:48:21,756 --> 00:48:23,690
I remember when you
caught that one.

434
00:48:23,758 --> 00:48:26,694
Yes. And you took it away from
me, didn't you?

435
00:48:26,762 --> 00:48:28,696
Yes, I did.

436
00:48:42,716 --> 00:48:45,652
We're behind the lines, but we know
how to honour the soldier...

437
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,656
who goes on in spite of
blood and death.

438
00:48:48,724 --> 00:48:50,659
Gentlemen, my son.

439
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:51,659
- Prosit.
- Prosit.

440
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:52,660
Cheers.

441
00:48:56,734 --> 00:48:59,670
I'm glad to know you, young man,
I am glad to know you.

442
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:05,678
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh? Terrible.

443
00:49:05,747 --> 00:49:08,682
But we must carry on.

444
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:12,687
After all, you do at least get
decent food out there.

445
00:49:12,755 --> 00:49:15,691
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally.

446
00:49:15,759 --> 00:49:20,697
But the best for our soldiers all
the time. That's our motto.

447
00:49:20,765 --> 00:49:23,702
The best for our soldiers.

448
00:49:25,772 --> 00:49:26,705
But...

449
00:49:26,774 --> 00:49:29,709
you must give the Frenchies
a good licking!

450
00:49:34,784 --> 00:49:37,720
And, if you boys want to
come home...

451
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:43,660
let me show you what you must
do before you can come home.

452
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:46,664
Give us a hand there,
men.

453
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:50,670
Now, then, there's the line.

454
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:54,675
Runs so,
in a "V".

455
00:49:54,743 --> 00:49:57,679
Here is St. Quentin. You can
see for yourself.

456
00:49:57,747 --> 00:49:59,682
You're almost through now.
All right?

457
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,686
Shove ahead out there and
don't stick to that...

458
00:50:02,754 --> 00:50:04,688
everlasting French warfare!

459
00:50:04,756 --> 00:50:09,695
Smash through the johnnies! And
then you will have peace.

460
00:50:09,763 --> 00:50:14,701
When you get in it... the war isn't
the way it looks back here.

461
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,706
Oh! You don't know
anything about it.

462
00:50:17,774 --> 00:50:19,708
Of course, you know about
the details...

463
00:50:19,776 --> 00:50:22,712
but this relates
to the whole!

464
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,716
You can't judge that.

465
00:50:25,784 --> 00:50:29,721
Of course, you do your duty
and you risk your life.

466
00:50:29,789 --> 00:50:32,724
But for that, you receive
the highest honour.

467
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:36,730
I said that every man in the war
ought to have the Iron cross.

468
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:40,770
First, the enemy lines must be
broken through in Flanders.

469
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:43,673
- On to Paris! Push on to Paris!
- Right.

470
00:50:43,742 --> 00:50:45,676
No, not in Flanders. I'll tell you
just where the...

471
00:50:45,744 --> 00:50:47,678
break should come.

472
00:50:47,746 --> 00:50:48,679
Here.

473
00:50:48,748 --> 00:50:50,682
The enemy has too many
reserves there.

474
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:53,687
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that...

475
00:50:53,755 --> 00:50:56,690
when they're halfway through
St. Quentin already?

476
00:50:56,758 --> 00:50:59,694
Because Flanders is
a flat country!

477
00:50:59,762 --> 00:51:02,698
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!

478
00:51:19,789 --> 00:51:21,723
From the farms they
have gone;...

479
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:24,727
from the schools, from
the factories.

480
00:51:24,795 --> 00:51:27,731
They have gone bravely,
nobly, ever forward...

481
00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:34,730
realizing there is no other duty
now but to save the fatherland.

482
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:39,747
Paul! How are you,
Paul?

483
00:51:39,815 --> 00:51:41,680
Glad to see you,
Professor.

484
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:46,689
You've come at the right moment,
Baumer! Just at the right moment.

485
00:51:46,757 --> 00:51:51,695
And as if to prove all have said,
here is one of the first to go.

486
00:51:51,763 --> 00:51:54,699
A lad who sat before me on
these very benches...

487
00:51:54,767 --> 00:51:58,704
who gave up all to serve in the
first year of the war...

488
00:51:58,772 --> 00:52:04,713
one of the iron youth who have made
Germany invincible in the field.

489
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:08,717
Look at him... sturdy and bronze
and clear-eyed.

490
00:52:08,785 --> 00:52:12,723
The kind of soldier every one
of you should envy.

491
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:15,727
Oh, lad, you must
speak to them.

492
00:52:15,795 --> 00:52:19,732
You must tell them what it means
to serve your fatherland.

493
00:52:21,803 --> 00:52:24,738
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.

494
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:29,745
Just a word... Just tell them how
much they're needed out there.

495
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,749
Tell them why you went and
what it meant to you.

496
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,751
I can't say anything.

497
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:39,758
You can remember some deed of
heroism, some touch of nobility.

498
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:41,692
Tell about it.

499
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:50,705
I can't tell you anything
you don't know.

500
00:52:51,775 --> 00:52:54,711
We live in the trenches
out there. We fight.

501
00:52:54,779 --> 00:52:58,716
We try not to be killed,
sometimes we are.

502
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:02,721
That's all.

503
00:53:06,795 --> 00:53:08,729
No. No, Paul.

504
00:53:08,797 --> 00:53:11,733
I've been there! I know
what it's like.

505
00:53:11,801 --> 00:53:14,737
That's not what one
dwells on, Paul.

506
00:53:14,805 --> 00:53:17,741
I heard you in here reciting
that same old stuff...

507
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:21,746
making more iron men,
more young heroes.

508
00:53:21,814 --> 00:53:23,749
You still think it's beautiful
and sweet to die...

509
00:53:23,817 --> 00:53:25,751
for your country, don't you?

510
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,755
We used to think
you knew.

511
00:53:28,823 --> 00:53:31,759
The first bombardment
taught us better.

512
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:35,764
It's dirty and painful to die
for your country.

513
00:53:35,832 --> 00:53:37,767
When it comes to dying for
your country...

514
00:53:37,835 --> 00:53:39,770
it's better not to die at all!

515
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:42,774
There are millions out there dying
for their countries...

516
00:53:42,842 --> 00:53:44,776
and what good is it?

517
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:48,781
Paul!

518
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,785
You asked me to tell them how
much they're needed out there.

519
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,788
He tells you,
"Go out and die."

520
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:56,792
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's
easier to say "Go out and die"

521
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,795
than it is to do it.

522
00:53:58,863 --> 00:54:00,797
Coward!

523
00:54:00,865 --> 00:54:03,801
And it's easier to say it than
to watch it happen.

524
00:54:05,872 --> 00:54:08,808
No! No! Boys, boys!

525
00:54:09,877 --> 00:54:13,815
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say...
- It's no use talking like this.

526
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,817
You won't know
what I mean.

527
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:19,822
Only, it's been a long while since we
enlisted out of this classroom.

528
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:23,828
So long I thought maybe the whole
world had learned by this time.

529
00:54:23,896 --> 00:54:27,832
Only now they're sending babies,
and they won't last a week!

530
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,835
I shouldn't have come
on leave.

531
00:54:29,903 --> 00:54:33,840
Up at the front you're alive or
you're dead, and that's all!

532
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:36,844
You can't fool anybody
about that very long.

533
00:54:36,912 --> 00:54:40,885
Up there we know we're lost and done
for whether we're dead or alive.

534
00:54:40,886 --> 00:54:43,786
Three years we've had
of it... four years.

535
00:54:43,854 --> 00:54:47,791
Every day a year and every
night a century.

536
00:54:47,859 --> 00:54:50,796
Our bodies are earth and our
thoughts are clay...

537
00:54:50,864 --> 00:54:53,799
and we sleep and
eat with death.

538
00:54:53,867 --> 00:54:56,803
We're done for because you
can't live that way...

539
00:54:56,871 --> 00:54:58,806
and keep anything
inside you!

540
00:54:58,874 --> 00:55:01,810
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.

541
00:55:01,878 --> 00:55:04,814
I've got four days more, but
I can't stand it here!

542
00:55:04,882 --> 00:55:06,817
I'll go back tomorrow!

543
00:55:06,885 --> 00:55:08,819
Sorry.

544
00:55:20,903 --> 00:55:23,839
Mother, you'll catch clod here.
You must go to sleep.

545
00:55:23,907 --> 00:55:26,843
There'll be plenty of time
to sleep...

546
00:55:26,911 --> 00:55:28,845
when you're gone.

547
00:55:29,914 --> 00:55:33,852
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?

548
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,855
Yes, Mother. Orders were
changed.

549
00:55:38,926 --> 00:55:41,795
Are you very much afraid,
Paul?

550
00:55:41,865 --> 00:55:43,799
No, Mother.

551
00:55:47,872 --> 00:55:49,806
There's something I want to
say to you, Paul.

552
00:55:49,874 --> 00:55:50,808
It's...

553
00:55:51,878 --> 00:55:55,814
Just be on your guard against
the women out there.

554
00:55:55,882 --> 00:55:57,817
They're no good.

555
00:55:58,887 --> 00:56:00,821
Where we are, there aren't
any women, Mother.

556
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:05,827
Be very careful at the
front, Paul.

557
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:07,831
Yes, Mother,
I will.

558
00:56:07,899 --> 00:56:10,834
I'll pray for you
every day.

559
00:56:10,902 --> 00:56:15,840
And if you could, get a job that's
not quite so dangerous.

560
00:56:17,912 --> 00:56:21,849
Yes, Mother. I'll try and get
in the cookhouse.

561
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:24,852
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if...

562
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,857
- The others say anything...
- That won't worry me, Mother.

563
00:56:28,926 --> 00:56:30,860
Now, you must go to bed and
you must get well...

564
00:56:30,928 --> 00:56:32,863
quickly before I come back.

565
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:39,872
I put two sets of underwear...
new ones... in your pack.

566
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:42,809
They'll keep you nice
and warm.

567
00:56:42,878 --> 00:56:44,812
They're all wool.

568
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,814
That's sweet of you.

569
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:50,819
Good night...
my son.

570
00:56:57,897 --> 00:56:59,831
Good night,
Mother.

571
00:57:22,929 --> 00:57:24,864
Oh, Mother, Mother.

572
00:57:24,932 --> 00:57:27,868
You still think
I'm a child.

573
00:57:28,938 --> 00:57:32,874
Why can't I put my head
in your lap and cry?

574
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:57,840
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Yes, sir.

575
00:58:20,939 --> 00:58:23,874
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.

576
00:58:23,942 --> 00:58:26,878
We had 150 men, but this is all
that came back yesterday.

577
00:58:26,946 --> 00:58:29,883
But now they're going to give us
enough to make 150 again.

578
00:58:30,952 --> 00:58:32,886
How old are you?

579
00:58:33,955 --> 00:58:35,890
Sixteen.

580
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:57,852
No use. I couldn't
find anything.

581
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,854
We'll have to eat the
sawdust.

582
00:59:00,924 --> 00:59:04,861
Not me! I'll go hungry first.
It makes me sick.

583
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:23,886
Now it's gonna be a
real war again.

584
00:59:23,954 --> 00:59:25,888
Paul! How's old Paul?

585
00:59:25,956 --> 00:59:27,891
Here I am.

586
00:59:27,959 --> 00:59:29,894
You know, the 2nd Company's
getting hard to find.

587
00:59:29,962 --> 00:59:31,897
Nobody seemed to know
where you were.

588
00:59:31,965 --> 00:59:34,900
I'm glad you found it.

589
00:59:38,974 --> 00:59:40,908
I guess I don't get
much of this.

590
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:49,854
There used to be some food in the
sawdust. Now it's all sawdust.

591
00:59:50,923 --> 00:59:53,859
No joke, either. Eats ya
up inside.

592
00:59:54,928 --> 00:59:56,863
This doesn't look much like
the old 2nd Company.

593
00:59:56,932 --> 00:59:59,867
The replacements are
all like that.

594
00:59:59,935 --> 01:00:01,869
Not even old enough to
carry a pack.

595
01:00:01,937 --> 01:00:03,872
All they know how
to do is die.

596
01:00:04,942 --> 01:00:08,879
I guess... some of the old-timers
are here yet.

597
01:00:08,947 --> 01:00:13,886
Paul, they're trying to invent
something to kill me right now.

598
01:00:14,955 --> 01:00:16,889
Where's Westhus?

599
01:00:16,957 --> 01:00:21,895
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it.

600
01:00:22,966 --> 01:00:26,902
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.

601
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:28,905
You mean they want us to
go on fighting?

602
01:00:28,973 --> 01:00:30,907
That's what they say.

603
01:00:30,975 --> 01:00:32,911
They're crazy!

604
01:00:32,979 --> 01:00:34,913
Germany'll be empty
pretty soon.

605
01:00:36,983 --> 01:00:38,918
Where is... Where is Detering?

606
01:00:39,987 --> 01:00:43,857
He got homesick. You remember
about the cherry blossoms?

607
01:00:43,926 --> 01:00:45,860
I guess he never got
over that.

608
01:00:45,928 --> 01:00:49,866
He started out one night to go home
and help his wife with the farm.

609
01:00:49,934 --> 01:00:53,871
They got him behind the lines, and
we never heard of him since.

610
01:00:53,939 --> 01:00:57,876
He was just homesick, but probably
they couldn't see it that way.

611
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:02,882
Where's Kat? Is he...

612
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,888
Not Kat! If he were out, the
war would be over.

613
01:01:06,956 --> 01:01:10,893
You remember what he always says:
They're saving him for the last.

614
01:01:10,961 --> 01:01:12,895
- Where is he?
- He's out looking for food...

615
01:01:12,963 --> 01:01:14,898
something to make
soup with.

616
01:01:14,966 --> 01:01:17,902
- Which way?
- Down the road about...

617
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:19,905
two miles that way.

618
01:01:19,973 --> 01:01:21,907
I'll see you later.

619
01:01:34,993 --> 01:01:35,925
Kat!

620
01:01:40,967 --> 01:01:41,866
Paul!

621
01:01:57,955 --> 01:01:59,890
Hello, Paul.

622
01:02:01,961 --> 01:02:04,896
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now. It's fine.

623
01:02:06,967 --> 01:02:09,903
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been...

624
01:02:09,971 --> 01:02:11,906
over this country
with a rake.

625
01:02:11,974 --> 01:02:13,908
Let's sit down there.

626
01:02:16,981 --> 01:02:20,918
Tell me, Paul... how was
it at home?

627
01:02:20,986 --> 01:02:22,920
Have a good leave?

628
01:02:22,988 --> 01:02:25,925
- In spots.
- What's the matter?

629
01:02:27,995 --> 01:02:30,931
I'm no good for back
there anymore, Kat.

630
01:02:30,999 --> 01:02:34,936
None of us are. We've been
in this too long.

631
01:02:35,004 --> 01:02:37,940
The young men thought I was a
coward because I told them that...

632
01:02:38,008 --> 01:02:41,877
we learn that death is stronger
than duty to one's country.

633
01:02:42,948 --> 01:02:45,884
The old men said
"Go on. Push on to Paris."

634
01:02:45,952 --> 01:02:47,887
My father even wanted me to
wear my uniform around him.

635
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:52,894
It's not home back
there anymore.

636
01:02:52,962 --> 01:02:57,900
All I could think of was, "I'd like
to get back and see Kat again."

637
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:01,906
You're all I've got left,
Kat.

638
01:03:01,974 --> 01:03:04,909
I'm not much to have left.

639
01:03:04,977 --> 01:03:06,912
I missed you, Paul.

640
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:10,917
At least we know what it's all about
out here. There're no lies here.

641
01:03:11,987 --> 01:03:13,921
Push on to Paris?

642
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:16,925
You ought to see what they've
got on the other side.

643
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:18,928
They eat white bread
over there.

644
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:21,931
They've got dozens of
airplanes to our one...

645
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:24,935
and tanks that'll go
over anything.

646
01:03:25,003 --> 01:03:26,937
What've we got left?

647
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:30,943
Guns so worn they drop shells
on our own men.

648
01:03:31,011 --> 01:03:33,947
No food, no ammunition,
no officers.

649
01:03:35,016 --> 01:03:36,951
Push on to Paris!

650
01:03:38,021 --> 01:03:39,955
So that's the way they talk
back there.

651
01:03:42,025 --> 01:03:43,960
I guess we'd better
be going.

652
01:03:51,037 --> 01:03:53,974
How I lied to my
poor mother.

653
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:56,977
I told her it wasn't so bad
out here because there was...

654
01:03:57,045 --> 01:03:58,980
always a lot of us together.

655
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:03,987
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning
to believe that I told her the truth.

656
01:04:05,056 --> 01:04:05,988
Down!

657
01:04:15,069 --> 01:04:18,004
That's another one that missed us.
Come on. Let's go.

658
01:04:18,072 --> 01:04:22,010
Wait a minute. Looks like the old
bread wagon's broke down.

659
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:25,014
I guess I don't walk the
rest of the way.

660
01:04:25,082 --> 01:04:27,016
Did that get ya, Kat?

661
01:04:27,084 --> 01:04:29,020
Aah, I think it broke my shin.

662
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:34,026
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.

663
01:04:34,094 --> 01:04:37,029
- Just my luck?
- Good luck.

664
01:04:37,097 --> 01:04:39,033
That means the war is over.

665
01:04:39,101 --> 01:04:41,068
Oh, no, sir!

666
01:04:41,069 --> 01:04:43,970
This war don't end till
they really get me.

667
01:04:44,039 --> 01:04:45,974
Now this one...

668
01:04:46,042 --> 01:04:47,977
Easy, now.

669
01:04:48,045 --> 01:04:49,980
- Hey!
- Easy!

670
01:04:50,048 --> 01:04:50,980
Easy!

671
01:04:53,051 --> 01:04:55,988
Come on. I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.

672
01:05:00,061 --> 01:05:00,993
Easy.

673
01:05:02,063 --> 01:05:02,995
All right.

674
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:18,016
Well, kid... now we're gonna
be separated.

675
01:05:18,084 --> 01:05:22,022
Maybe we can do something together
later on when the war is over.

676
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,022
Yes, kid.

677
01:05:23,091 --> 01:05:26,027
You give me your address,
I'll give you mine.

678
01:05:32,103 --> 01:05:35,038
You can't get both of us
in one day.

679
01:05:35,106 --> 01:05:38,042
Ah, we'll surely see each
other again, Kat.

680
01:05:39,112 --> 01:05:42,981
Remember that day when you brought
the whole pig into the factory?

681
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:46,987
And that day in the woods when you
taught us how to dodge shells?

682
01:05:47,055 --> 01:05:50,993
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.

683
01:05:52,062 --> 01:05:53,996
I was a young recruit then.

684
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:01,006
Here we are.
Here we are.

685
01:06:05,078 --> 01:06:07,014
All right now, Kat.

686
01:06:11,086 --> 01:06:14,022
You could've spared yourself
the trouble. He's dead.

687
01:06:14,091 --> 01:06:17,027
Oh, no. He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.

688
01:06:17,095 --> 01:06:19,029
He's dead.

689
01:06:32,115 --> 01:06:35,050
Would you like to take
his pay book?

690
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:40,056
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.

691
01:06:49,069 --> 01:06:52,005
Your deal. Get his name
and number?

692
01:06:52,073 --> 01:06:55,009
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus
Katczinsky, 306.

693
01:09:08,118 --> 01:09:15,049
THE END
