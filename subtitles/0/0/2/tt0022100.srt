1
00:01:54,114 --> 00:02:03,498
Just you wait a little while,
The nasty man in black will come

2
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:12,174
With his little chopper,
He will chop you up!

3
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,800
You're out

4
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,558
Stop singing that awful song

5
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,228
Don't you hear me?

6
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,775
Always that awful song

7
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:46,166
Just you wait a little while,
The nasty man in black will come

8
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:18,782
What's the matter?

9
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,287
I told those kids to stop
singing that awful song

10
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,831
But they keep singing
it over and over

11
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,250
As if we haven't heard
enough of that murderer

12
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:32,337
Oh, leave them be

13
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,799
If they're singing, at
least we know they're okay

14
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,719
Yes, I guess you're right

15
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,898
10,000 Marks Reward
WHO lS THE MURDERER?

16
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,985
Since June 11, little
KLAUS KLAWlTZKY and

17
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,737
his sister KLARA have disappeared

18
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,032
Evidence leads us to believe
the children were victims

19
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,077
of a similar crime
committed last fall

20
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,789
against the DOERlNG sisters

21
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,626
What a pretty ball!

22
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,756
What's your name?

23
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,634
Elsie Beckmann

24
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,457
Did Elsie come with you?

25
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:17,002
No, she didn't

26
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,034
Thank you

27
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,840
A thrilling new chapter!
Passionate, moving, sensational

28
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,844
Just a moment, Mr. Gehrke

29
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,391
-Tell me, Mr. Gehrke.
-Yes?

30
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,601
Have you seen Elsie?

31
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,896
Didn't she just come up
the stairs?

32
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,233
No, she isn't here yet

33
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,402
She won't be long now.
Good-bye, Mrs. Beckmann

34
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,405
Good-bye, Mr. Gehrke

35
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:39,371
Extra! Extra! Extra!

36
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,165
New crime!

37
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,168
Who is the murderer?

38
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:54,720
Because the police have not
published my first letter

39
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:58,307
I am writing today
directly to the NEWSPAPERS

40
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,018
Continue your investigations

41
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:03,395
Everything will happen

42
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:07,232
just as I have told you.
But I have not yet finished

43
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,618
10,000 MARKS REWARD
Who is the murderer?

44
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:22,039
Christ! Here we go again.
It's horrible

45
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,625
10,000 Marks
The lettering is too small

46
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,585
We can't read it

47
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,921
Hey, you, read it out loud

48
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,632
-"The unknown murderer".
-Let him read! Hey! Quiet!

49
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,968
"The terror in our town
has found a new..."

50
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,725
Certain evidence leads us
to believe that the murderer

51
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:47,606
is the same one who has
already killed eight children

52
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,816
We must remind you again

53
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:55,113
that a mother's first duty
is to guard her children

54
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,450
from the danger which
always threatens

55
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:04,581
Also, the danger is often
hidden in some attractive bait

56
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:11,880
Candy, a toy, and fruit can be
the murderer's weapons

57
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,466
True, true!

58
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,513
Come on! Come on!
Read, read on

59
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,724
Okay, okay. "The anxiety of
the general public is very high

60
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,144
because the police have not yet
completed their investigations

61
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,189
But the police are faced
with an almost impossible problem."

62
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:36,488
"The criminal has left no clue.
Who is the murderer?"

63
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:44,162
What is he like?
Where is he hiding?

64
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,499
No one knows.
Still, he is one of us

65
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,335
Is it your neighbor?

66
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,508
Yes, that's right

67
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,219
Why look at me when you say that?

68
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,431
-You know very well.
-What do I know very well?

69
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:08,395
-Think about it.
-What are you saying?

70
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:14,526
I saw you go up those stairs
behind that little girl

71
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,154
What?! You are crazy,
you dirty swine!

72
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,908
Who's a swine? Me?
Or a man who chases little girls?

73
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,452
You bastard! You swine!

74
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,245
Murderer!

75
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,373
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

76
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:32,169
I'll see you in court.
I'll see you in court

77
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,881
Now, now, gentlemen! Calm down!

78
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,176
Slanderer!

79
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,304
Trying to ruin my reputation

80
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,181
Slanderer! Terrible man!

81
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:48,644
The police listen to him!
They're searching my house!

82
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,355
How awful! What a shame!

83
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:53,982
Searching a man's house
because of an anonymous letter

84
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:58,278
Mr. Jager, calm down!
We're only doing our job

85
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:02,991
When we are so upset?
Scared about the children

86
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:07,246
Look, that's why the police
must follow every clue

87
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,082
Any man in the street
could be the guilty one

88
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,170
Can you please tell me
what time it is?

89
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,463
Yes, my child

90
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:27,224
Now, my child, go home.
Where do you live?

91
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:31,270
What's it to you
where the kid lives?

92
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,108
Why were you bothering that kid?

93
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:41,697
But - but - I did nothing!
What do you want with me?

94
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,283
Just you wait and see

95
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,452
Let me go!
It's an outrage!

96
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,830
-What's going on?
-It's an outrage!

97
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,415
What does he want?

98
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,000
Don't get so excited

99
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,043
Punch him in the face!

100
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:58,046
-Bothering children.
-Acting like a big shot!

101
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,966
Let me go! I did nothing!

102
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:03,135
You wanted to get her
alone, didn't you?

103
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,679
Yes, then kill her like
all the others, right?

104
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:10,726
It's the murderer! It's him!
Hold him! Call the police!

105
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:14,479
No police around when you
need them. Officer, officer!

106
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:20,152
Move along please,
move along now. Don't block!

107
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:24,448
You can catch pickpockets but
you'd better get the murderer

108
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,242
What? Is he the murderer?

109
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,872
Move along now.
Come on, get a move on

110
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:48,889
MURDERER WRlTES TO NEWSPAPERS

111
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,573
It's a terrible scandal

112
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,535
This will have a bad effect

113
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:15,082
on public opinion, lnspector.
It's very serious

114
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:20,546
But, sir, we cannot stop the
murderer from writing letters!

115
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,382
This man is a mental case

116
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:25,634
He gets a kick from

117
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:29,596
seeing himself in the papers

118
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:33,559
We immediately got in touch
with the newspaper

119
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:38,188
They sent us the original letter.
The lab is working on it

120
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:42,025
Of course, you can't get good
fingerprints from a postcard

121
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:46,738
which went through so many hands

122
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:51,869
We'll compare the results
with our archives

123
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:58,166
We must try everything
to find a clue or a lead

124
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,961
Then, we'll send the letter
to the graphologist

125
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:13,390
The very particular shape
of the letters...

126
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:14,975
do you follow me?

127
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:21,857
indicates in this man a very
strong and pathological sexuality

128
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:32,201
Some of the broken letters

129
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:37,331
reveal an actor's personality

130
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:44,796
which can be indolent
or even lazy

131
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:58,268
In the whole, the handwriting
shows clear signs of insanity

132
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:06,693
Yes, lnspector, certainly.
You and your men are very good

133
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,948
But, nevertheless, results,
we must have results

134
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,616
Results!

135
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:20,457
Minister, my men are only
getting 12 hours sleep a week

136
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:24,503
as well as searches
on the spot, Minister

137
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:29,424
They start their shift
already tired

138
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,972
Don't forget, this job
is nervously trying

139
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:39,268
especially when the success
rate is so low

140
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,980
The homicide officers work
restlessly

141
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:47,484
They're always on alert

142
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:53,073
following any clue,
even the slightest one

143
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,076
that may lead us to our man

144
00:17:56,451 --> 00:18:00,414
Minister, consider their findings
on the scene of the crime

145
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:08,797
We find, for instance,
behind a hedge

146
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:14,761
a little white paper bag

147
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,891
Clearly it held the candy

148
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:28,025
In a corner, we found some
crumbs and some sugar grains

149
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:32,863
Within a radius of 2 kilometers,
we have searched

150
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:37,242
in all the candy shops to find out
where the bag came from

151
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,036
But in vain

152
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,999
Every day the search widens

153
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:55,511
but, of course, no one
remembers anything

154
00:18:56,303 --> 00:19:05,729
Nevertheless, we keep on
searching, getting nowhere

155
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:14,613
without much hope of
finding a solution. Our men...

156
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,618
What good is that?
I know you're trying

157
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:27,292
but an unknown murderer
terrorizes the town

158
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:30,754
A town of four million
and your police are failing

159
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:40,931
Minister, you don't seem to
understand the difficulties

160
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:48,188
Only on the way home
of the missing child

161
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:54,987
we got fifteen different
testimonies

162
00:19:55,153 --> 00:20:00,200
Just listen: "Testimony 1478
in the Beckmann murder case..."

163
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,661
-You know nothing.
-More than you, Sir!

164
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,165
Gentlemen! Can't you agree
what color hat

165
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:12,004
that little girl wore
when you saw her?

166
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,506
Of course, lnspector, it was red

167
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,009
-lnspector, it was green.
-lt was a red hat!

168
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,635
It was a green hat!

169
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:27,561
Stop! It's hopeless.
Thank you, gentlemen

170
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:31,356
-Next witness.
-Of course, lnspector

171
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:36,361
if you listen
to a color-blind man!

172
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:43,452
The police have investigated
over 1,500 clues

173
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:48,957
Documents fill 60 volumes.
We have all available men

174
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:53,462
We have systematically
combed all adjoining areas

175
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:57,382
Every thicket, every piece
of undergrowth, every bush

176
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:04,556
in every hole,
we might find something

177
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:10,270
We sent out police dogs.
The best trackers are on the scent

178
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:14,233
to no avail.
Since the murderer's first crime

179
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:20,572
police have inspected all
the flop-houses every night

180
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:23,617
and checked the identity
of every vagrant

181
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:28,580
Such measures hurt our popularity
and make people nervous

182
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:34,378
But we watch all railway stations
and raid the underworld hangouts

183
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:40,759
Despite all this, the police haven't
succeeded in finding anything

184
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:14,853
The police. Get back!

185
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:48,971
Let me go, you dirty bastard!
Let me go!

186
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:55,769
Please let me go, won't you?
You son of a bitch! Let go!

187
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:03,735
Let her go, you filthy pig!

188
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:05,112
Quiet! Quiet!

189
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,574
The head cop!

190
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:13,996
Quiet!
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

191
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:17,249
Police orders: nobody leaves.
Get your papers ready

192
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:35,893
Quiet! C'mon kids,
let's not be stupid

193
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,145
It's Fatty Lohmann!

194
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:41,315
Loh-mann, Loh-mann, Loh-mann!

195
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:44,067
Loh-mann! Loh-mann!

196
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:51,950
Quiet! Quiet!

197
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,871
You'll wear yourselves out

198
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:57,414
It would be better if
you got the murderer

199
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:59,499
Yes! Much better!

200
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:05,797
Quiet! Be reasonable!

201
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:14,306
Spread out. All of you spread out.
C'mon, papers out!

202
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,934
-I haven't got any.
-Show me your papers

203
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,978
Please let me go, lnspector

204
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:26,276
Show me your papers

205
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,862
-I think we know each other.
-Yes, we do

206
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,698
To the headquarters!

207
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,659
With all this mess, not a client!

208
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:39,748
Don't make any trouble. No papers
and you go to headquarters

209
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:43,001
I am innocent

210
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,795
Don't talk nonsense

211
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:50,217
Quiet! Show me your papers

212
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:54,763
Don't push. It's everybody's turn

213
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:01,103
-Have you got your papers?
-I can't go around

214
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,605
with my birth certificate.
That's asking too much

215
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:06,066
-Don't mess with me.
-That's asking too much, lnspector

216
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:07,609
Headquarters for you

217
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,528
Look here, it's disgusting

218
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:04,917
Poor workmanship, old boy.
You've had it. To headquarters

219
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:07,669
Better luck next time, Willie

220
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:08,837
Shut your face!

221
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:10,714
Next

222
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,927
Fancy boy

223
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,695
What's wrong?

224
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,324
Pop Lohmann's got him

225
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:42,913
"Unsolved burglary at a fur shop."

226
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,752
Well, I guess I'd better
take you down to headquarters

227
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:52,631
But... my papers are in order

228
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:53,757
Next

229
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,635
No luck, huh?

230
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,015
Papers

231
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:03,141
I have none

232
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:04,685
Headquarters

233
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:06,061
No luck

234
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:08,772
Next, come on, let's go

235
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:27,351
This is wrecking our business,
Sarge, trouble every night

236
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,437
You can't have ten minutes
peace anymore. Give us a break!

237
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:36,818
It's no joke for us either,
out every night

238
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,738
Of course, but you're
drivin' away my clientele

239
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:42,241
and the guy you're looking
for ain't here

240
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:47,621
Do you know how mad everyone
is about this guy who's causing

241
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:53,585
a raid every night? 'Specially
the girls. Sure, they solicit

242
00:29:53,794 --> 00:30:01,343
but believe me, everyone
is a little mother at heart

243
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:07,391
I know a lot of crooks, get sort
of tender when they see kids

244
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:14,147
If they catch that bastard
they'll wring his neck

245
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:16,441
Ready to go, Sarge?

246
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:18,068
Good night

247
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:33,750
So it's the Crocodile tonight.
Two loads for the nick

248
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,176
What's keeping Schranker?

249
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:47,598
Is it three o'clock yet?

250
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:49,183
I'll find out

251
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:59,776
Hello, the exact time, please.
Two minutes to three

252
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:01,028
Thank you

253
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:54,164
There are more police on
the street tonight than whores

254
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,126
Wherever you spit, cops

255
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:01,255
Even when you've got a broad,
they don't leave you alone

256
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,382
They've gone nuts. All they
think about is the murderer

257
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:06,760
I have a little six-year-old and
every night I have to look under

258
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:10,848
the bed and in the closet to see
if the murderer is hiding there

259
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:16,061
You can't even do your job.
The police are everywhere

260
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:19,398
There's no privacy anymore.
I'm fed up with it

261
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:21,942
Tell us something new

262
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:29,908
What's keeping Schranker?

263
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:31,577
Maybe he's been caught

264
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:39,418
Not him. He did a bank job in
London. Scotland Yard trapped him

265
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:47,342
There he was, hands up, back to
the wall, millions of cops around

266
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:52,222
two seconds later there were
two corpses and he'd beat it!

267
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:54,308
The best man between
Berlin and San Francisco

268
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:58,270
Six years they've looked and they
haven't caught him yet

269
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:01,106
Haven't caught him yet,
but dogs can kill wolves

270
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:02,232
Shut up

271
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:19,124
The suspense is killing me.
He's always right on time

272
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:24,046
God be praised!

273
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:25,297
At last!

274
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:28,926
Well, hello! You've finally come.
Good afternoon

275
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:31,345
Are you crazy? Close the curtains

276
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,620
Gentlemen, the meeting
can now begin

277
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:59,623
According to regulations,
I confirm that the leadership of

278
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,417
every organization in
our union is represented

279
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:06,421
I assume you are all authorized
to vote on behalf of your members

280
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:11,468
Good. Let's not be held up
by procedure

281
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:17,432
We all know why we are here.
Some non-member is screwing up

282
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:25,732
our affairs. Daily raids by
the police for the child murderer

283
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:31,572
interfere with our business.
We can't put up

284
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:40,747
with this pressure any longer
in every hotel, cafe or pad

285
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:44,877
This state of affairs must not
be allowed to continue

286
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:48,672
We have to put things right
again or we'll all be ruined

287
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:56,513
Our funds are exhausted.
We'll have to use money allocated

288
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:04,730
for our colleagues' wives who
are being "hosted" by the state

289
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,608
Furthermore, our reputation
is suffering

290
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:10,360
Gentlemen, the cops are looking
for the murderer in our ranks!

291
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,449
When I run into a cop while on
business, he knows the risk

292
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:20,662
and so do l. If one of us dies,
OK, that's a risk one takes

293
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:25,250
It can happen. But you and I are
not on the level of this murderer

294
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:27,461
Absolutely!

295
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:30,088
We are doing our job,
we have to make a living

296
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:33,717
But this monster has no right
to live. He must disappear!

297
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:36,637
He must be eliminated,
without pity, without scruples

298
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:46,772
Gentlemen, our members have
to carry on normal business

299
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:51,527
without being handicapped
by nervous policemen

300
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:57,449
I ask you for advice

301
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:04,748
I suggest a closer watch on
lD cards, systematic searches

302
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:08,627
and police raids. More raids,
and much tougher ones

303
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:15,259
Spies. We need spies among
the police to give us warnings

304
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:18,136
The girls must take a little more
notice of the cops

305
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,848
We get into trouble because one
of the girls has talked too much

306
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:24,226
to her cop boyfriend. Now the girls
have to tell us what gives

307
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:38,615
We must be allowed to search
any house, apartment, back yard

308
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:42,286
in order to find a clue

309
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:52,129
We have contacts, we have to make
a statement to the press

310
00:36:52,588 --> 00:37:00,470
we have to tell them that
we condemn the bastard too

311
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:06,143
We should make it known that
he isn't in the underworld

312
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:18,614
I'm sure it's a man who looks
like he wouldn't hurt a fly

313
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:23,577
In his normal state, he might
even play marbles with the kids

314
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:35,964
or cards with his wife.
Otherwise, murderers like Grossmann

315
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:39,801
or Haarmann couldn't live
for years like they did

316
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:43,222
without their neighbors
suspecting them at all

317
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:47,643
We have to get that across
to the public. They must help

318
00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:53,774
Don't talk to me about the
public helping. It disgusts me

319
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:56,818
just to hear them talk.
Excuse me, Chief!

320
00:37:58,529 --> 00:38:05,911
But it's the truth. Christ! Help
from the public brings no clues!

321
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:11,250
Just a pile of letters with
the most incredible accusations!

322
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:12,459
Quite true

323
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,130
Calls to the police the moment
a garbage man crosses a yard!

324
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:23,762
But when we need accurate
information, they can't remember!

325
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:31,311
They've seen nothing. That's
help from the public for you

326
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:38,944
You're exaggerating
a little, Lohmann

327
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:41,780
No, he isn't

328
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:48,579
Most of the people
don't feel concerned

329
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:53,041
The majority of them
doesn't realize

330
00:38:53,208 --> 00:39:01,466
that a child disappearance
is also their problem

331
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:12,811
I've got an idea! Let's get
one of those guys, a telepath

332
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:16,273
one who finds handkerchiefs and
pocketbooks that have been hidden

333
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,234
I don't think the reward is enough

334
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:24,823
Chief, we have to offer a real
fortune for the murderer

335
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:26,867
None of this is getting
us anywhere

336
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:30,495
-That won't do any good.
-What's your idea?

337
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:33,373
Well, we just can't wait until the
police decide to arrest the fellow

338
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:44,718
The difficulty in solving crimes
like this comes from the fact

339
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:50,015
that the criminal and the victim
are connected only by chance

340
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:54,353
An instantaneous impulse
is the killer's only motive

341
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:58,357
We find the victim, we
identify him, then we find out

342
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:06,823
when he was last seen.
Then, nothing more

343
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:11,370
Children disappear

344
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:16,416
and you know what state
we find them in

345
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,925
if we find them

346
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:34,560
And the killer... as we know,
in this kind of crime

347
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:38,146
never leaves a mark behind

348
00:40:38,564 --> 00:40:42,526
This is what makes our job so hard
and our success so rare

349
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:45,904
The police have been looking
for eight months

350
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:50,325
Now, they'll catch him
only by luck

351
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:53,954
-We can't wait for that.
-We'll be ruined before then

352
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:55,581
Then what will we do?

353
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:15,976
We'll have to catch him ourselves

354
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:23,775
Yes! We must. That's it

355
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:33,535
There is still one possible way!
The guilty man must have

356
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:43,086
a record somewhere. A man
that disturbed must have come

357
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:52,179
upon the law before. We've
got to contact every clinic

358
00:41:52,346 --> 00:42:00,687
every prison, every asylum.
We'll have to make inquiries

359
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:07,027
about everyone freed as harmless
but with the same

360
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:15,285
pathological condition
as the killer

361
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:24,211
Every square foot must
be permanently watched

362
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:27,798
From now on, no child takes a
step without us being warned

363
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:30,342
OK, but how do we do it?

364
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:34,012
There must be people who can
go everywhere, not be noticed

365
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:37,099
who can follow children
without arousing suspicion

366
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:41,144
who can follow children
right up to their front doors

367
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:45,899
People no one would suspect

368
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:50,362
But who? People like that don't
exist. Who could do it? Who?

369
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,328
The beggars.
The beggars' union can do it

370
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:46,418
-Sausage going up.
-God! This cheese smells good

371
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,592
That finishes you

372
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:05,562
Stop snoring!
You'll wake up the lice

373
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:20,911
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16

374
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:07,916
Now we must take the back yards

375
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:12,296
Yes, from number 1 to 88

376
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:17,134
Next

377
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:26,560
You are responsible for the
courtyards in every block, 1 to 88

378
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:27,644
Right!

379
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:34,526
-What's next?
-89 to 196 High Street

380
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:43,869
89 to 196 High Street.
What's your union number?

381
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:47,206
3, 7, 95, Emil Dustermann

382
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:57,549
3, 7, 95, Dustermann, Emil

383
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,225
There you are, Emil.
Maybe you'll win 15,000

384
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:10,771
Touch wood!

385
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:55,148
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen

386
00:46:57,693 --> 00:46:59,361
Thank you

387
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:55,667
"When searching homes, we must
look for any clue which could

388
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:58,629
establish where the murderer's
letter to the papers originated

389
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:01,298
If there is an old wooden table,
if there is a red pencil

390
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:05,177
or writing paper of the same type.
Inquiries must be discreet."

391
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:06,345
Idiot

392
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:27,199
And here's a list of mental
patients who have been let out

393
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:31,370
as cured or harmless
in the last five years

394
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,415
Reports from every institute,
private and public

395
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:52,057
And that's a list
of their present addresses

396
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:28,844
Good morning

397
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:30,762
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

398
00:49:31,013 --> 00:49:32,097
What?

399
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,058
Does Mr. Beckert live here?

400
00:49:35,225 --> 00:49:38,437
I'm afraid I can't hear you.
I'm a bit hard of hearing

401
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:42,024
As if I couldn't tell.
Does Mr. Beckert live here?

402
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:47,613
Oh, Mr. Beckert... Yes...
But he has just gone out

403
00:49:47,946 --> 00:49:50,908
Too bad, I wanted to see him

404
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,203
I'm from the lncome Tax office

405
00:49:54,453 --> 00:49:59,583
Oh, good God! Tax people?
Would you like to wait?

406
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,460
Yes, thank you

407
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:12,262
-Please take a seat.
-Thank you

408
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:27,986
Like something to read?

409
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:29,112
Thank you. You're most kind

410
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:37,246
Tell me, Mrs. Winkler, does
Mr. Beckert take this paper?

411
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:40,666
Mr. Beckert?
No, he always borrows mine

412
00:53:46,643 --> 00:53:50,147
Mom! I was looking for you

413
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:54,735
You don't have to do this!
You know why

414
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:41,448
Good evening.
What would you like?

415
00:54:41,657 --> 00:54:43,283
Coffee

416
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:46,662
No... a vermouth... no, a brandy

417
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,231
There you are

418
00:55:19,653 --> 00:55:20,821
Another one

419
00:55:55,397 --> 00:55:56,481
The bill!

420
00:55:57,316 --> 00:55:59,860
Two brandies. 1.65, please

421
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:04,323
Thank you very much

422
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:14,458
Number 24: Beckert.
He does not take the Courier

423
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:19,129
A walnut table with a cloth.
No red pencil or traces of one

424
00:56:19,338 --> 00:56:24,009
No writing paper. In the waste
basket, a printed ad and

425
00:56:24,176 --> 00:56:27,679
a postcard with flowers
and "Regards, Paul" on it

426
00:56:27,888 --> 00:56:30,432
but no address of sender.
An empty cigarette pack

427
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:33,435
Ariston brand, a bag of candy
with the candy store name on it

428
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:38,607
Wait a moment...

429
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:45,072
Ariston, did you say?

430
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:54,456
Ar-is-ton...

431
00:56:55,165 --> 00:57:01,088
That rings a bell... Ariston

432
00:57:07,094 --> 00:57:12,766
Hello. Get me the file on
the Marga Perl murder. Hurry

433
00:57:15,394 --> 00:57:16,520
Thank you very much

434
00:57:25,112 --> 00:57:30,659
That's funny.
I've heard that before

435
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:39,585
It was... it was...

436
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,607
Hey! Henry!

437
00:58:08,739 --> 00:58:10,240
What is it?

438
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:16,914
Listen a moment. Someone
whistling. Can you hear him?

439
00:58:17,915 --> 00:58:19,124
There

440
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:27,549
He's just stopped. Did you see him,
the guy who was whistling?

441
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:30,969
-Yes, I can still see him.
-Yes?

442
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:35,474
Yes. He's talking to a little
girl and walking her down the street

443
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:39,186
-After him and don't let him go!
-But why?

444
00:58:39,353 --> 00:58:47,361
The day Elsie Beckmann was killed,
someone bought a balloon

445
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:50,155
He was with a little girl

446
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:58,956
and he whistled just like that!

447
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:32,174
Damn it, man! Are you crazy
throwing peels on the ground?

448
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:35,010
I might have broken my neck!
Unbelievable

449
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:39,932
I should report you to the police,
you're a menace to the public

450
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:43,310
Uncle

451
01:00:57,783 --> 01:01:02,704
There! That's it. They found
three cigarettes butts

452
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:07,125
at the scene of the crime.
Aristons!

453
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:14,842
Yes, the cigarettes are the same,
but there's no old wooden table

454
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:23,976
Of course, he could have written
that letter somewhere else

455
01:01:26,728 --> 01:01:30,566
Heavens, the windowsill!

456
01:01:44,663 --> 01:01:46,540
You're right

457
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,960
Just a minute

458
01:01:57,676 --> 01:01:59,094
A red pencil!

459
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:07,311
God, at last we're getting
somewhere

460
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:13,483
Yes, yes, what?
They have his trial!

461
01:02:14,651 --> 01:02:18,155
-Have they found him?
-The beggars found him

462
01:02:18,363 --> 01:02:20,991
-He was talking to a little girl.
-They put a mark on him

463
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:23,827
Can't you be quiet?
What's that?

464
01:02:24,703 --> 01:02:28,332
They are following the sign.
He isn't out of sight for a second

465
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:32,252
He's being watched

466
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:41,989
-Uncle.
-What is it?

467
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:43,907
You're all dirty

468
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:45,450
Where?

469
01:03:45,951 --> 01:03:47,578
There, on your shoulder

470
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:53,876
Here, I'll wipe it off

471
01:04:00,883 --> 01:04:03,635
-What's the matter?
-Come on, let's go

472
01:05:35,853 --> 01:05:38,355
He hasn't come out yet
or we would have seen him

473
01:05:38,564 --> 01:05:41,650
He must be in the courtyard,
he didn't come out this way

474
01:05:41,817 --> 01:05:43,110
He must be somewhere

475
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:51,451
Maybe he's hiding
inside the building

476
01:06:11,555 --> 01:06:12,389
Closing time!

477
01:06:12,806 --> 01:06:15,392
He mustn't get out
with everyone leaving

478
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:17,519
Christ! Here come
the first ones already

479
01:06:17,728 --> 01:06:19,396
Let's go out in the street

480
01:06:19,563 --> 01:06:20,939
Keep a sharp lookout

481
01:06:46,048 --> 01:06:50,594
Turn off the light or he'll suspect
something when he comes back

482
01:06:55,766 --> 01:06:57,267
What time is it?

483
01:06:59,186 --> 01:07:00,437
Nearly 6:30

484
01:07:19,164 --> 01:07:24,670
He must still be in the building,
anyway, he didn't come out

485
01:07:25,921 --> 01:07:34,346
Ok, Ok, yes... No, just a moment

486
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:38,225
The beggars have gone for more
help to search the whole area

487
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:40,519
The murderer must still be
in the building

488
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:48,026
What sort of place is it?

489
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:57,995
Nothing but offices. I don't
know what's in the cellar

490
01:07:58,996 --> 01:08:01,874
There's a branch of the savings
bank on the ground floor

491
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:06,336
and from the first to the fifth,
nothing but offices

492
01:08:06,503 --> 01:08:08,672
above that are lofts

493
01:08:14,136 --> 01:08:15,262
Look at that. It ain't possible

494
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:18,849
Anyone there?

495
01:08:27,524 --> 01:08:28,901
Anyone there?

496
01:08:47,753 --> 01:08:51,006
What next? Anyone there?

497
01:09:01,975 --> 01:09:08,148
Damn carelessness,
all that trouble for one door

498
01:09:29,545 --> 01:09:32,047
Yes, good

499
01:09:32,214 --> 01:09:34,842
Looks like that guy
is really cornered now

500
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:37,010
I think we should tip off
the cops right away

501
01:09:37,177 --> 01:09:39,638
-I agree.
-Now then, listen carefully

502
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:44,518
Hello. Just a moment. What?
Ok, call me right back

503
01:09:44,685 --> 01:09:46,228
What is it? What's the matter?

504
01:09:46,395 --> 01:09:48,647
Are you crazy or something?

505
01:09:48,814 --> 01:09:51,024
The police? No. We're going
to get that guy ourselves

506
01:09:51,608 --> 01:09:52,985
Listen... now, the time is

507
01:09:54,862 --> 01:09:55,696
8:00

508
01:09:57,447 --> 01:10:01,243
Good. Then at 9:00, 10:00, 11:00!

509
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:28,770
Good evening. Did you know
your gates are not closed?

510
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:31,607
What? But that's impossible!

511
01:10:32,566 --> 01:10:35,444
I've only just... But it is

512
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:40,240
Open up, and no noise!

513
01:10:41,366 --> 01:10:43,202
Are you going to open up?

514
01:10:43,535 --> 01:10:44,786
Come on, get it open

515
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:46,914
Get a move on!

516
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:17,569
How many watchmen are
there in the building?

517
01:11:21,073 --> 01:11:23,158
Ok, so you don't want to answer?

518
01:12:00,237 --> 01:12:02,406
There are two watchmen
on their rounds

519
01:12:26,013 --> 01:12:27,556
Bloody hell!

520
01:12:30,309 --> 01:12:31,560
Damn it

521
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,334
Shit!

522
01:13:50,806 --> 01:13:55,727
Careful with the lights.
And don't walk like elephants

523
01:13:56,436 --> 01:13:58,313
-What's the story?
-He isn't in the basement.

524
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,566
We went through it
and found nothing

525
01:14:01,233 --> 01:14:03,735
Friede and Auguste are still
going through the boiler rooms

526
01:14:04,695 --> 01:14:05,654
Wait

527
01:14:05,863 --> 01:14:07,155
That's the last one

528
01:14:07,573 --> 01:14:09,241
Go up and join Emile.
He needs help

529
01:14:09,408 --> 01:14:10,242
Go on, get a move on!

530
01:14:17,124 --> 01:14:18,500
Schranker sent me

531
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:22,171
Good. Listen carefully

532
01:14:22,629 --> 01:14:26,550
It's a new type of time switch

533
01:14:27,759 --> 01:14:31,722
Here's a general plan here.
If the time switches aren't set

534
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:36,560
they automatically go off at the
nearest police station. Get it?

535
01:14:39,646 --> 01:14:40,981
Have you got it?

536
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:43,066
What do you think I am,
some kind of a nut?

537
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:49,198
-He isn't in the boiler room.
-Fine

538
01:14:49,615 --> 01:14:51,450
We moved all the coal

539
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:58,373
Are you nuts?

540
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:04,087
What if the door is wired up?
Want to get the police here?

541
01:15:05,464 --> 01:15:09,426
Well, we have to get in if we're
going to search the whole place

542
01:15:09,635 --> 01:15:13,388
But not by the door, you ass!
Use the office on the floor above

543
01:15:13,555 --> 01:15:14,723
Go through the ceiling

544
01:15:58,183 --> 01:16:00,018
Right, let's go

545
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:52,029
Hey! What's up?

546
01:16:53,614 --> 01:16:56,241
Hey! Answer me. What's happening?
Paul - tell us

547
01:16:56,408 --> 01:16:57,868
What's going on?

548
01:16:57,993 --> 01:16:59,828
I heard some banging!

549
01:16:59,953 --> 01:17:01,997
-What did you say?
-What's the hurry?

550
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:13,258
I must see Schranker!

551
01:17:14,468 --> 01:17:19,598
He's in the attic! I heard him
knocking. He's in the attic!

552
01:17:35,197 --> 01:17:36,490
Keep quiet

553
01:18:25,205 --> 01:18:26,665
Get on with it, then

554
01:18:26,832 --> 01:18:27,958
He must be there

555
01:18:29,585 --> 01:18:30,919
There's the switch

556
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,173
Force the locks

557
01:18:39,803 --> 01:18:41,388
Come on. Hurry up!

558
01:18:48,353 --> 01:18:51,815
I've got him.
He's in the attic

559
01:18:52,024 --> 01:18:54,276
I heard someone hammer
I told Schranker immediately

560
01:18:54,443 --> 01:18:57,237
He's up there with 8 men.
They'll get him any moment

561
01:18:57,404 --> 01:18:59,656
I just came down to tell you

562
01:19:00,032 --> 01:19:03,035
If I hadn't been alert, we'd
have looked for him for hours

563
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:04,077
Look out! The watchman!

564
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:12,169
3... 1... 4

565
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:14,046
314

566
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,392
Let's get out of here!

567
01:19:27,559 --> 01:19:31,897
The cops will be here any
moment. The watchman rung in

568
01:19:32,064 --> 01:19:34,024
Let's get out of here!

569
01:19:34,483 --> 01:19:40,739
Stop! Quiet! We've got
5 more minutes and 6 more

570
01:19:40,906 --> 01:19:43,659
compartments to search. Carry on.
Get on with it. Only hurry!

571
01:19:43,825 --> 01:19:45,661
Out of the way.
You can't do it that way

572
01:19:53,752 --> 01:19:54,878
He's not in here

573
01:19:55,045 --> 01:19:55,879
Next door!

574
01:19:56,338 --> 01:19:57,714
Come on. Quicker

575
01:20:03,178 --> 01:20:04,388
Not here either

576
01:20:04,596 --> 01:20:05,848
Come on, keep it up! Next door

577
01:20:12,312 --> 01:20:14,356
Quick! We've only got
about 3 minutes left

578
01:20:14,523 --> 01:20:15,732
Hurry up! Quickly!

579
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:20,195
This one hasn't got a padlock,
he must be here. Go on, open it!

580
01:20:20,362 --> 01:20:22,823
It's locked from the inside,
let me do it!

581
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:24,533
Hurry up, only one minute left!

582
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:31,123
Here he is, here he is,
the dirty bastard!

583
01:20:32,624 --> 01:20:34,585
Get going, hurry up -
Everybody out!

584
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:41,258
Go on - move!
Hurry up, quickly!

585
01:20:44,845 --> 01:20:46,555
Christ! Get out while
you can, you fool!

586
01:20:48,849 --> 01:20:50,934
-Anybody left?
-A few up top, they're on the way

587
01:20:52,728 --> 01:20:54,855
No reason for you to wait for them.
With or without that guy

588
01:20:55,939 --> 01:20:58,442
It doesn't matter, get away.
What are they up to? Christ!

589
01:20:59,484 --> 01:21:02,196
Bloody hell! At last! Thank God!

590
01:21:40,108 --> 01:21:46,532
Hey! He's not down here.
Who's pulled up the ladder?

591
01:21:48,075 --> 01:21:51,370
Who's pulled up the ladder?

592
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:54,706
Bunch of morons

593
01:22:10,514 --> 01:22:11,390
Hello

594
01:22:11,723 --> 01:22:13,016
Hands up

595
01:22:13,517 --> 01:22:17,145
How can I put my hands up when
I'm trying to hang onto the ladder?

596
01:22:17,396 --> 01:22:18,438
Get out of there

597
01:22:28,907 --> 01:22:30,868
For once, I'm innocent

598
01:22:32,244 --> 01:22:33,704
As a newborn babe

599
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:43,714
This will surprise you, Franz,
but I believe you

600
01:22:46,758 --> 01:22:51,847
Well, then everything
is in order. I can leave then

601
01:22:52,097 --> 01:22:53,640
One minute

602
01:22:56,768 --> 01:22:57,895
Cigarette?

603
01:22:58,562 --> 01:22:59,730
Oh, boy

604
01:23:11,783 --> 01:23:13,911
I'll take your word for it

605
01:23:15,495 --> 01:23:21,877
On condition you tell me

606
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:30,427
who was the man you were
looking for and found there?

607
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:36,433
I don't understand, lnspector.
A man, you said?

608
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:42,606
I know nothing about that.
There must be some mistake

609
01:23:43,148 --> 01:23:47,277
I know nothing, nothing at all

610
01:23:48,195 --> 01:23:54,701
Of course. Only I don't understand
why you are covering up

611
01:23:54,910 --> 01:24:00,832
for the gang who left you
in the lurch. Funny friends!

612
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:05,629
Leaving you right in
it and running off. Bah!

613
01:24:08,882 --> 01:24:13,011
That won't wash with me,
lnspector

614
01:24:47,004 --> 01:24:48,755
After all, I'm not risking
very much

615
01:24:49,715 --> 01:24:54,261
Maybe a little bit of damage.
But nothing was stolen

616
01:24:54,428 --> 01:24:58,724
Of course, something was stolen.
In fact, a good deal

617
01:24:58,891 --> 01:25:04,563
What? Stolen? How much?

618
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:07,941
If you talk, I'll tell you

619
01:25:09,067 --> 01:25:11,570
I've already told you,
I don't know anything

620
01:25:14,156 --> 01:25:25,918
All right. Well, think about it.
It's amazing what one remembers

621
01:25:27,336 --> 01:25:34,760
when one is left alone
for an hour or two

622
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:37,763
Take him away!

623
01:25:54,321 --> 01:25:56,114
Send the night watchman in here

624
01:25:59,618 --> 01:26:01,578
Get the watchman Damowitz

625
01:26:08,544 --> 01:26:09,545
Sit down

626
01:26:12,297 --> 01:26:17,886
Now then, you said in your
statement - Listen carefully

627
01:26:18,095 --> 01:26:20,806
You may have to repeat it
under oath

628
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:25,185
You clearly heard

629
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:30,399
one of the burglars say to another,
"we've found him

630
01:26:30,858 --> 01:26:34,236
I've discovered the guy.
He's in the attic." Is that correct?

631
01:26:35,028 --> 01:26:44,121
Yes, lnspector. Yes, I'll swear
to whatever you want

632
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:51,795
Right. You may go home now.
But please be ready to testify

633
01:26:52,337 --> 01:26:58,093
Of course, lnspector.
Good day, lnspector

634
01:27:14,026 --> 01:27:16,987
Tell me, is lnspector Lohmann
in the building?

635
01:27:18,447 --> 01:27:23,869
He's talking to someone? No,
it doesn't matter. I'll come up

636
01:27:27,206 --> 01:27:36,006
What? Good. Hasn't come in yet.
You're watching Mrs. Winkler?

637
01:27:39,092 --> 01:27:40,385
Come in

638
01:27:46,767 --> 01:27:49,228
We've surrounded the whole block

639
01:27:49,394 --> 01:27:51,730
If he wanted to get home,
he'd run into us

640
01:27:52,314 --> 01:27:54,608
Now you have to wait

641
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,694
I'll be in my office
if you have some news

642
01:28:02,866 --> 01:28:03,742
Hell...

643
01:28:10,666 --> 01:28:11,750
What do you want?

644
01:28:12,668 --> 01:28:17,548
I wanted to ask you a favor

645
01:28:21,385 --> 01:28:22,803
Disgusting

646
01:28:23,595 --> 01:28:26,348
I wanted to ask you

647
01:28:26,515 --> 01:28:28,767
Anyway, read a bit of that

648
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:37,442
-Reports?
-Yes

649
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:40,112
Burglary in an office block

650
01:28:47,619 --> 01:28:48,787
Bennostrasse?

651
01:28:49,788 --> 01:28:51,498
That's a very quiet neighborhood

652
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:55,669
Perhaps it's not as quiet
as all that

653
01:28:57,629 --> 01:28:59,423
Hell, this is becoming serious

654
01:29:08,015 --> 01:29:10,642
Did they intend to empty
the whole place, then?

655
01:29:12,311 --> 01:29:15,147
What can they have been
looking for in the coal?

656
01:29:16,982 --> 01:29:19,776
Look at that. It's incredible

657
01:29:22,821 --> 01:29:24,781
Good Lord!

658
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,786
This is madness!

659
01:29:33,165 --> 01:29:37,920
Ah, now it makes sense.
They were after the safe

660
01:29:38,253 --> 01:29:40,088
Good God! What's it all about?

661
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,134
I don't understand it at all

662
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:49,640
They haven't even attacked
that one. Are they all crazy?

663
01:29:52,351 --> 01:29:54,311
Well, I'll be damned!

664
01:29:54,853 --> 01:30:01,693
Well, what have you got to say?
Nothing stolen, but a man taken

665
01:30:02,819 --> 01:30:03,612
Fantastic!

666
01:30:04,738 --> 01:30:07,824
And Franz the burglar
was arrested. Isn't talking

667
01:30:08,033 --> 01:30:11,620
Frightened, evidently.
Actually, I know him well

668
01:30:11,787 --> 01:30:14,248
He's one who'd rather jump
from the fifth floor

669
01:30:14,414 --> 01:30:16,041
than get mixed up in a murder

670
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:23,674
Could we set a trap for him?

671
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:28,095
Could you help me, Lohmann?

672
01:30:31,932 --> 01:30:35,519
I see what you're getting at

673
01:30:37,938 --> 01:30:41,024
Let's take a look at this Franz

674
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:45,988
You're wanted for questioning

675
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:52,619
What? Four people for me?

676
01:30:52,786 --> 01:30:53,787
Come on

677
01:31:16,894 --> 01:31:23,609
The murder squad?
Inspector Karl Lohmann

678
01:31:29,615 --> 01:31:34,745
What do you want with me?
What's the murder squad want?

679
01:31:46,173 --> 01:31:51,220
Yes, old boy, your case has been
passed over to me now

680
01:31:52,846 --> 01:32:00,437
But why? What for?

681
01:32:03,148 --> 01:32:06,568
You did your work
a little too well

682
01:32:12,908 --> 01:32:14,952
One of the watchmen

683
01:32:25,003 --> 01:32:26,213
Dead?

684
01:32:31,218 --> 01:32:36,306
Planning and assisting with a
murder. It's a bad show, Franz

685
01:32:36,515 --> 01:32:41,103
I can't go on with it. I don't
want to have anything to do with it

686
01:32:41,687 --> 01:32:44,523
I'll tell you everything,
everything I know

687
01:32:45,524 --> 01:32:48,026
Very wise, but unfortunately
too late

688
01:32:48,193 --> 01:32:51,530
Inspector, it can't be too late...
Please, lnspector

689
01:32:51,697 --> 01:32:55,784
It isn't possible! Listen,
I'm going to tell you everything

690
01:32:56,702 --> 01:33:00,163
Even who we were looking for
in that damn building

691
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:01,248
Well, then

692
01:33:03,292 --> 01:33:04,543
The child murderer

693
01:33:14,553 --> 01:33:19,349
What? What? Who?

694
01:33:19,558 --> 01:33:21,935
The child murderer, lnspector

695
01:33:28,233 --> 01:33:29,401
Wait

696
01:33:48,086 --> 01:33:49,671
This had to happen to me!

697
01:33:53,717 --> 01:33:56,220
Of all people

698
01:34:04,269 --> 01:34:05,604
Sit down

699
01:34:10,108 --> 01:34:13,987
Now, we're going
to have a little talk

700
01:34:14,738 --> 01:34:16,532
If you want to, lnspector

701
01:34:16,698 --> 01:34:20,869
And mind you, don't lie.
OK, let's start

702
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:26,333
What have you do to with the
murderer, and where'd you take him?

703
01:34:29,711 --> 01:34:35,300
Well, lnspector, you know the old

704
01:34:35,467 --> 01:34:37,970
distillery of Kuntz and Levy?

705
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:43,559
-The one that went bankrupt?
-Yes. Since then

706
01:34:43,725 --> 01:34:47,271
the building's been abandoned
and nobody cares

707
01:35:23,807 --> 01:35:29,479
What do you want with me?
Let me go! Let me go!

708
01:35:29,646 --> 01:35:33,275
I've done nothing to you,
let me go, you swine!

709
01:35:33,442 --> 01:35:34,651
Let me go!

710
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:39,156
What do you bastards want with me?
What do you want?

711
01:36:11,021 --> 01:36:12,064
Help!

712
01:36:12,731 --> 01:36:16,860
Help! Let me go. I want to
get out. Get me out of here

713
01:36:17,069 --> 01:36:18,695
Let me out!

714
01:36:21,323 --> 01:36:23,534
You will not get out of here

715
01:36:25,577 --> 01:36:30,916
But gentlemen, I don't even
know what you want me for

716
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:37,047
I beg you, set me free.
There must be some mistake

717
01:36:41,969 --> 01:36:49,393
No, no. No mistake.
Impossible. There's no mistake

718
01:36:55,566 --> 01:36:58,902
No mistake

719
01:37:03,949 --> 01:37:08,620
Do you recognize it? It's a
balloon like the one you gave

720
01:37:08,787 --> 01:37:10,455
Iittle Elsie Beckmann!

721
01:37:10,789 --> 01:37:12,583
A balloon like that

722
01:37:20,966 --> 01:37:23,260
Where did you bury little Martha?

723
01:37:29,057 --> 01:37:34,563
But I never...
I never even knew her

724
01:37:35,647 --> 01:37:38,609
You never knew her?

725
01:37:41,403 --> 01:37:42,738
And what about this one?

726
01:37:45,032 --> 01:37:46,909
And this one?

727
01:37:49,661 --> 01:37:50,954
You didn't know
this one either, huh?

728
01:37:52,289 --> 01:37:55,667
Stop him, stop him...
Don't let him get away

729
01:38:02,466 --> 01:38:04,343
Let me go!

730
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:28,784
You have no right
to treat me this way!

731
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,869
We'll show you what right we have!

732
01:38:31,036 --> 01:38:33,247
You have no right to hold me here

733
01:38:33,956 --> 01:38:36,792
Right? Someone like you
has no rights. Kill him!

734
01:38:36,959 --> 01:38:38,919
Yes, kill him!

735
01:38:40,379 --> 01:38:42,506
We must treat him like
a mad dog. Crush him!

736
01:38:54,101 --> 01:38:59,648
You talk of rights.
You will get your rights

737
01:39:00,732 --> 01:39:04,570
We are all law experts here

738
01:39:07,739 --> 01:39:10,242
from 6 weeks in Tegel prison

739
01:39:10,576 --> 01:39:13,287
to 15 years in Brandenburg

740
01:39:16,415 --> 01:39:22,546
You will get your rights,
you will even get a lawyer

741
01:39:24,423 --> 01:39:26,383
Everything will be done
according to the rule of law

742
01:39:27,134 --> 01:39:30,220
A lawyer? A lawyer?
I don't need a lawyer

743
01:39:30,387 --> 01:39:33,223
Who is accusing me?
You, maybe? You?

744
01:39:36,476 --> 01:39:41,148
Just a moment. If I were
you, sir, I'd keep quiet

745
01:39:41,648 --> 01:39:45,235
Your life's at stake,
in case you didn't know it

746
01:39:46,486 --> 01:39:48,197
Who are you?

747
01:39:50,991 --> 01:39:55,662
I have the dubious honor
of being your defense counsel

748
01:39:56,955 --> 01:39:58,999
But I'm afraid it won't be
much use to you

749
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:05,964
But, but... Do you want to kill
me? Murder me, just like that?

750
01:40:06,173 --> 01:40:09,218
We just want to render you harmless

751
01:40:10,969 --> 01:40:13,472
But you'll only be that way
when you are dead

752
01:40:13,639 --> 01:40:16,016
But if you kill me,
it'll be cold-blooded murder!

753
01:40:19,353 --> 01:40:22,272
I demand that you hand me over
to the police

754
01:40:25,734 --> 01:40:30,447
I demand to be handed over to
the jurisdiction of common law

755
01:40:33,742 --> 01:40:38,497
That would suit you, wouldn't it?
Then you'll invoke paragraph 51

756
01:40:38,664 --> 01:40:42,501
And spend the rest of your life
in an institution at state expense

757
01:40:42,793 --> 01:40:47,297
And then you'd escape,
or else get a pardon, then

758
01:40:47,506 --> 01:40:50,676
there you are, free as air,
with a law-protected pass

759
01:40:50,843 --> 01:40:57,140
because of mental illness,
off again, chasing little girls

760
01:40:57,307 --> 01:40:59,184
We're not going
to let that happen

761
01:40:59,476 --> 01:41:01,979
We must make you powerless.
You must disappear

762
01:41:02,187 --> 01:41:02,813
Yes, disappear!

763
01:41:03,021 --> 01:41:06,191
I can't help what I do

764
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:18,203
I can't help it, I can't...

765
01:41:19,329 --> 01:41:24,835
The old story, we never
can help it in court

766
01:41:31,675 --> 01:41:35,512
What do you know about it?
Who are you anyway?

767
01:41:36,555 --> 01:41:48,901
Who are you? Criminals?
Are you proud of yourselves?

768
01:41:49,443 --> 01:41:54,072
Proud of breaking safes
or cheating at cards?

769
01:41:54,865 --> 01:41:59,036
Things you could just as
well keep your fingers off

770
01:41:59,369 --> 01:42:03,874
You wouldn't need to do all that
if you'd learn a proper trade

771
01:42:04,082 --> 01:42:08,212
or if you'd work. If you
weren't a bunch of lazy bastards

772
01:42:08,378 --> 01:42:14,510
But l... I can't help myself!
I have no control over this

773
01:42:14,676 --> 01:42:22,351
this evil thing inside me,
the fire, the voices, the torment!

774
01:42:26,063 --> 01:42:30,692
You mean to say
that you have to murder?

775
01:42:36,114 --> 01:42:41,578
It's there all the time, driving
me out to wander the streets

776
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:51,964
following me, silently,
but I can feel it there

777
01:42:52,965 --> 01:43:01,765
It's me, pursuing myself

778
01:43:02,391 --> 01:43:07,271
I want to escape, to escape
from myself! But it's impossible

779
01:43:07,437 --> 01:43:16,655
I can't escape. I have to obey it.
I have to run... endless streets

780
01:43:17,656 --> 01:43:20,784
I want to escape, to get away

781
01:43:21,577 --> 01:43:26,707
And I'm pursued by ghosts.
Ghosts of mothers

782
01:43:26,874 --> 01:43:29,960
And of those children...
They never leave me

783
01:43:30,502 --> 01:43:40,846
They are there, always there...
Always, except when I do it

784
01:43:42,222 --> 01:43:44,266
When l...

785
01:43:51,815 --> 01:43:53,817
Then I can't remember anything

786
01:43:55,652 --> 01:44:04,494
And afterwards I see those posters
and read what I've done

787
01:44:05,704 --> 01:44:10,250
Did I do that? But I can't
remember anything about it

788
01:44:11,376 --> 01:44:16,673
But who will believe me?
Who knows what it's like to be me?

789
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:25,390
How I'm forced to act... How l
must... Must... Don't want to

790
01:44:25,557 --> 01:44:29,728
Must! Don't want to, but must!
And then... a voice screams

791
01:44:29,895 --> 01:44:32,189
I can't bear to hear it

792
01:44:32,773 --> 01:44:37,194
I can't go on

793
01:44:44,785 --> 01:44:49,081
The accused has said that
he cannot help himself

794
01:44:50,249 --> 01:44:56,922
That is to say, he has to murder.
As this is the case

795
01:44:57,089 --> 01:44:58,882
he has pronounced
his own death sentence

796
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:06,723
Someone who admits to being
a compulsive murderer

797
01:45:06,932 --> 01:45:10,644
should be snuffed out,
like a candle

798
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:15,357
This man must be
wiped out, eliminated

799
01:45:15,607 --> 01:45:18,318
Perfect! Just what I think!

800
01:45:24,199 --> 01:45:26,743
I wish to speak

801
01:45:26,952 --> 01:45:28,579
The defense lawyer will speak

802
01:45:31,331 --> 01:45:39,298
Our very honorable president,
who is, I believe, wanted

803
01:45:39,464 --> 01:45:42,092
by the police for three murders -

804
01:45:42,301 --> 01:45:43,594
That's got nothing to do with it

805
01:45:44,887 --> 01:45:49,808
...claims that because my client
acts under an irresistible impulse

806
01:45:49,975 --> 01:45:51,810
he is condemned to death

807
01:45:51,977 --> 01:45:53,228
He is right!

808
01:45:54,354 --> 01:45:59,735
He is mistaken. Because it is
that very fact that clears him

809
01:45:59,902 --> 01:46:01,111
Just a minute, enough!

810
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:03,155
Mad old drunk!

811
01:46:03,447 --> 01:46:08,952
Is this very obsession which
makes my client not responsible

812
01:46:09,411 --> 01:46:14,917
And nobody can be punished
for something he can't help

813
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:17,336
-Ridiculous!
-Do you suggest

814
01:46:17,503 --> 01:46:19,463
that this brute should get off?

815
01:46:20,964 --> 01:46:25,344
I mean this man is sick.
A sick man should be handed over

816
01:46:25,511 --> 01:46:29,097
not to the executioner,
but to the doctor

817
01:46:29,348 --> 01:46:31,183
Can you promise he'd be cured?

818
01:46:31,350 --> 01:46:33,185
What use are asylums, then?

819
01:46:33,519 --> 01:46:35,687
And what would happen
if he escaped?

820
01:46:35,854 --> 01:46:38,565
Yes. Or if they released him
as harmless? And what if

821
01:46:38,732 --> 01:46:42,152
the compulsion to kill returns?
Another man-hunt for months

822
01:46:42,361 --> 01:46:45,656
Paragraph 51 again. The asylum,
then another escape or release

823
01:46:45,822 --> 01:46:50,202
Then the compulsion all over again,
and so on, and on

824
01:46:51,745 --> 01:46:59,169
No one can kill a man who isn't
responsible for his actions

825
01:46:59,336 --> 01:47:03,048
Not the state,
and certainly not you

826
01:47:04,633 --> 01:47:09,847
The state must see that this man
becomes harmless and no longer

827
01:47:10,013 --> 01:47:13,767
is a danger to his fellow citizens

828
01:47:18,313 --> 01:47:22,526
You've never had children, huh?
So you haven't lost any

829
01:47:24,778 --> 01:47:33,370
But if you knew what it's like
to lose one... Go ask the parents!

830
01:47:34,288 --> 01:47:38,125
Ask them what those days
and nights were like when

831
01:47:38,292 --> 01:47:43,755
they didn't know what had happened.
And then when they finally knew

832
01:47:44,131 --> 01:47:46,216
-Ask the mothers!
-She's right!

833
01:47:49,595 --> 01:47:53,432
Do you think they'll have mercy?

834
01:47:53,849 --> 01:47:56,018
-She's right.
-I'll say she is

835
01:47:56,185 --> 01:47:58,687
-No mercy! No pardon!
-Give the murderer to us

836
01:47:59,021 --> 01:48:00,772
Kill the beast!

837
01:48:00,939 --> 01:48:04,109
-Crush the brute!
-Kill him! Beat him!

838
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:14,995
All that won't silence me

839
01:48:18,790 --> 01:48:25,255
I won't allow a crime to be
committed in my presence

840
01:48:25,964 --> 01:48:28,967
I demand that this man...

841
01:48:30,135 --> 01:48:35,766
that this man be granted
the protection of the law

842
01:48:36,892 --> 01:48:41,104
I demand that this man be
handed over to the police

843
01:48:41,355 --> 01:48:44,733
-To the police!
-Filthy stooge

844
01:49:11,343 --> 01:49:13,220
In the name of the law

845
01:49:36,869 --> 01:49:38,078
In the name of the people

846
01:49:39,246 --> 01:49:43,208
This won't bring back
our children

847
01:49:48,755 --> 01:49:57,347
We, too, should keep a closer
watch on our children
