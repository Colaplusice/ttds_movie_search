1
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,319
How beautifully dramatic.

2
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:12,281
The crudest, savage, exhibition
of nature at her worst, without,

3
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:16,368
and we three, we elegant three, within.

4
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:19,372
I should like to think that an irate Jehovah

5
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:22,792
was pointing those arrows
of lightning directly at my head.

6
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:28,422
The unbowed head of George Gordon,
Lord Byron, England's greatest sinner.

7
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:31,550
But I cannot flatter myself to that extent.

8
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:34,219
Possibly those thunders
are for our dear Shelley.

9
00:02:34,303 --> 00:02:37,014
Heaven's applause
for England's greatest poet.

10
00:02:37,514 --> 00:02:41,017
- What of my Mary?
- She is an angel.

11
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:44,312
- You think so?

12
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:47,272
You hear?

13
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,900
Come, Mary. Come and watch the storm.

14
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,527
You know how lightning alarms me.

15
00:02:52,862 --> 00:02:56,699
Shelley, darling, will you please
light these candles for me?

16
00:02:56,783 --> 00:02:58,784
Mary, darling.

17
00:02:58,868 --> 00:03:01,120
Astonishing creature.

18
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:05,623
- I, Lord Byron?
- Frightened of thunder, fearful of the dark.

19
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:09,753
And yet you have written a tale
that sent my blood into icy creeps.

20
00:03:10,462 --> 00:03:15,550
Look at her, Shelley. Can you believe that
lovely brow conceived of Frankenstein?

21
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:19,762
A monster created from
cadavers out of rifled graves.

22
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:23,723
- Isn't it astonishing?
- I don't know why you should think so.

23
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:25,641
What do you expect?

24
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:29,729
Such an audience needs something
stronger than a pretty little love story.

25
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:32,065
So why shouldn't I write of monsters?

26
00:03:32,316 --> 00:03:36,278
No wonder Murray's refused to publish
the book. His public would be shocked.

27
00:03:36,362 --> 00:03:38,613
It will be published, I think.

28
00:03:38,697 --> 00:03:41,783
Then, darling, you will have
much to answer for.

29
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:46,995
The publishers did not see that
my purpose was to write a moral lesson

30
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,459
of the punishment that befell
a mortal man who dared to emulate God.

31
00:03:52,543 --> 00:03:57,505
Whatever your purpose was, I take great
relish in savouring each separate horror.

32
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:59,632
I roll them over on my tongue.

33
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:02,886
Don't, Lord Byron.
Don't remind me of it tonight.

34
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,181
What a setting in that
churchyard to begin with!

35
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:12,937
The sobbing women, the first clod of earth
o"n the coffin. That was a pretty chill."

36
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:17,192
Frankenstein and the dwarf stealing
the body out of its new-made grave.

37
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:22,112
Cutting the hanged man down from
the gallows, where he swung in the wind.

38
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:25,240
The cunning of Frankenstein
in his mountain laboratory,

39
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:29,828
picking dead men apart and
building up a human monster

40
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:34,540
so fearful and so horrible that only
a half-crazed brain could have devised.

41
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,795
And then the murders,
the little child who "drowned.

42
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:43,591
Henry Frankenstein himself
thrown from the top of the burning mill

43
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:46,051
by the very monster he had created.

44
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:51,682
And it was these fragile white fingers
that penned the nightmare.

45
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:54,893
Ah! You've made me prick myself, Byron.

46
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,979
It's bleeding.

47
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:03,651
There, there. I do think it a shame, Mary,
to end your story quite so suddenly.

48
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:08,573
That wasn't the end at all. Would you
like to hear what happened after that?

49
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:10,908
I feel like telling it.

50
00:05:10,993 --> 00:05:13,954
It's a perfect night for mystery and horror.

51
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:17,498
The air itself is filled with monsters.

52
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:23,586
I'm all ears. While heaven blasts the night
without, open up your pits of hell.

53
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:28,716
Well, then, imagine yourselves
standing by the wreckage of the mill.

54
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,386
The fire is dying down.

55
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,514
Soon the bare skeleton
o"f the building rolls over,"

56
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:38,142
the gaunt rafters against the sky.

57
00:05:56,201 --> 00:06:01,580
Well, I must say, that's the best fire
I ever saw in all me life.

58
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:07,002
- What are you cryin' for?
- It's terrible.

59
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:11,966
I know. But after all them murders and
poor Mr Henry being brought home to die,

60
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:16,721
I'm glad to see the monster
roasted to death before my very eyes.

61
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:19,056
It's too good for him.

62
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,687
It's all the devil's work, and you'd better
cross yourself quick before he gets you.

63
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:29,608
Come along, come along. It's all over.

64
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:32,276
Get back to your homes and go to sleep.

65
00:06:34,488 --> 00:06:37,406
There it goes again.
It ain't burnt out at all.

66
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,909
- There's more yet.
- Isn't the monster dead yet?

67
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:44,455
It's high time every decent
man and wife was in bed.

68
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,917
That's his insides caught at last.

69
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:50,878
Insides is always the last to be consumed.

70
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:53,505
Move on. You've had enough
excitement for one night.

71
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:57,133
This strange man
you call a monster is dead.

72
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:59,511
Monster, indeed!

73
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:05,140
You may thank your lucky stars they sent
for me to safeguard life and property.

74
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:08,269
Why didn't you safeguard
those drownded and murdered?

75
00:07:08,353 --> 00:07:12,231
Come, now. We want no rallying, no riots.

76
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:14,650
- Who's riotin'?
- Move on, move on.

77
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,443
Good night all, and pleasant dreams.

78
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:19,946
Ah, pleasant dreams yourself.

79
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:24,951
Thinks he's everybody just because
he's a burgomaster. Huh!

80
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:35,586
Poor Mr Henry. He was to have been
married today to that lovely girl Elizabeth.

81
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:40,174
Cover him up. Someone must
break the news to the poor girl.

82
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:42,676
Ride as fast as you can to the castle,

83
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,513
and tell the old Baron Frankenstein
we are bringing his son home.

84
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:50,517
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, shut up.

85
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:55,980
Come home, Hans.
The monster is dead now.

86
00:07:56,064 --> 00:08:00,526
Nothing could be left alive in that furnace.
Why do you stay here?

87
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,029
I want to see with my own eyes.

88
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:06,448
Oh, Hans, he must be dead.

89
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:10,870
And, dead or alive, nothing can
bring our little Maria back to us.

90
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:15,999
If I can see his blackened bones,
I can sleep at night.

91
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,253
Come back, Hans!
You will be burned yourself!

92
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:24,466
Maria drowned to death and
you burned up! What should I do then?

93
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:26,635
No!

94
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:09,132
Hans. Hans!

95
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:13,178
Where are you? Hans!
Are you all right?

96
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:19,309
I hear you. Here,
give me your hand, Hans.

97
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,229
Here.

98
00:10:27,582 --> 00:10:30,418
Oh, heaven, what is this?

99
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:36,423
Henry? Tell me.

100
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:40,261
Oh, milady, how can we tell you?

101
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,477
Bring him in.

102
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,198
- Albert.
- What do you want?

103
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:06,618
It's alive. The monster, it's alive!

104
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:11,123
- Ah, shut up, you old fool.
- I saw it.

105
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:14,251
It ain't turned to no skeleton at all.

106
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:16,545
It lived right through the fire.

107
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:19,965
Ah, go bite your tongue off.
We don't believe in ghosts.

108
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:22,050
Nobody'll believe me.

109
00:11:22,134 --> 00:11:24,636
All right, I'll wash my hands of it.

110
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,348
Let 'em all be murdered in their beds.

111
00:11:58,126 --> 00:12:03,255
- Speak to me, Henry.
- Oh, milady, he'll never speak again.

112
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:06,216
I was foretold of this.

113
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,178
I was told beware my wedding night.

114
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:21,231
Oh, look, milady! He's alive!

115
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,610
Henry, darling.

116
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,656
Elizabeth.

117
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:34,284
Oh, what a terrible wedding night.

118
00:12:49,716 --> 00:12:51,800
You can go to bed now, Mary.

119
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:04,438
- You'll soon be better.
- I feel almost myself again.

120
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:08,650
When you're strong enough, we'll go
away and forget this horrible experience.

121
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:12,196
Forget? If only I could forget.

122
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,615
But it's never out of my mind.

123
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:18,327
I've been cursed for delving
into the mysteries of life.

124
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,372
Perhaps death is sacred,
and I've profaned it.

125
00:13:22,456 --> 00:13:25,667
For what a wonderful vision it was.

126
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:32,423
I dreamed of being the first to give to the
world the secret that God is so jealous of.

127
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:35,300
The formula for life.

128
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:38,971
Think of the power to create a man.

129
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:42,683
And I did. I did it. I created a man.

130
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:46,103
And who knows? In time I could
have trained him to do my will.

131
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:50,481
I could have bred a race. I might even
have found the secret of eternal life.

132
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:55,277
Henry, don't say those things. Don't
think them. It's blasphemous and wicked.

133
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:57,238
We are not meant to know those things.

134
00:13:57,321 --> 00:14:00,615
It may be that I'm intended
to know the secret of life.

135
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:04,078
It may be part of the divine plan.

136
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:07,706
No, no. It's the devil that prompts you.

137
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:11,501
It's death, not life, that is in it all
and at the end of it all.

138
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:16,798
Listen, while you've been lying here,
tossing in your delirium, I couldn't sleep.

139
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:19,300
And when you rave of your insane desire

140
00:14:19,384 --> 00:14:22,262
to create living men
from the dust of the dead,

141
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:26,849
a strange apparition has
seemed to appear in the room.

142
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:32,103
It comes, a figure like Death. And
each time it comes more clearly, nearer.

143
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:35,941
It seems to be reaching out for you,
as if it would take you away from me!

144
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:38,402
There it is. Look.

145
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:42,822
- There.
- I see nothing, Elizabeth. Where?

146
00:14:42,906 --> 00:14:45,033
There's nothing there.

147
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,994
There! There! It's coming for you!

148
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,206
Nearer! Henry! Henry! Henry! Henry!

149
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,417
Henry!

150
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:08,431
Albert! Drat the man.
He's never here when he's wanted.

151
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:12,350
- What's the good of footmen anyway?

152
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:15,020
All right. All right!

153
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:18,774
Don't knock the castle over!
We're not all dead yet.

154
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:32,203
- There's nobody at home.
- Let me in, my good woman.

155
00:15:32,286 --> 00:15:35,330
I know the young
Baron Frankenstein is at home.

156
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:39,917
He's sick. He's in his bed, where all
decent folk should be at this time of night.

157
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:45,507
Tell him that Dr Pretorius is here
on a secret matter of grave importance,

158
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,593
and must see him alone, tonight.

159
00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:53,430
Dr Pretorius?

160
00:15:53,515 --> 00:15:55,433
Pretorius?

161
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:03,357
- What was it? What was the name?
- Dr Pretorius.

162
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:07,236
There ain't no such name.

163
00:16:15,493 --> 00:16:17,495
Now, you stay there.

164
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:26,671
- Who's there?
- It's Minnie, milady.

165
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:28,840
Oh, come in.

166
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:32,884
It's Dr Pretorius.

167
00:16:32,969 --> 00:16:37,013
He says he wants to see
the master. Most insistent.

168
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,640
Pretorius?

169
00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:41,268
He's a very queer-looking
old gentleman, sir.

170
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:45,439
And must see you, on a secret,
grave matter, he said.

171
00:16:45,522 --> 00:16:47,483
Tonight. Alone.

172
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:51,027
- Bring him in.
- Henry, who is this man?

173
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,071
Dr Pretorius.

174
00:16:56,657 --> 00:16:59,451
Baron Frankenstein now, I believe?

175
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:01,954
Won't you come in, Doctor?

176
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:06,041
I trust you will pardon
this intrusion at so late an hour.

177
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,836
I would not have ventured to come,
had I not a communication to make

178
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,673
which I suspect may be
of the utmost importance to yourself.

179
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:18,803
This is Professor Pretorius. He used to be
Doctor of Philosophy at the university.

180
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:21,596
- But, uh...
- But was booted out.

181
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:24,350
Booted, my dear Baron, is the word.

182
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:26,435
For knowing too much.

183
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:29,855
Henry's been very ill, Professor.
He shouldn't be disturbed.

184
00:17:29,939 --> 00:17:32,273
I am also a doctor, Baroness.

185
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:34,485
Why have you come here tonight?

186
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:37,571
My business with you, Baron, is private.

187
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:39,739
Elizabeth, please.

188
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:48,163
I do hope he won't upset Henry.

189
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,378
- What do you want?
- We must work together.

190
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:57,755
Never. This is outrageous.

191
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,635
I'm through with it.
I'll have no more of this hell-spawn.

192
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,723
As soon as I'm well,
I'm to be married, and I'm going away.

193
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:08,975
I must beg you to reconsider.

194
00:18:09,143 --> 00:18:11,852
You know, do you not,
that it is you, really,

195
00:18:11,937 --> 00:18:15,106
who are responsible
for all those murders?

196
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:19,861
There are penalties
to pay for killing people.

197
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:23,197
And with your creature
still at large in the countryside...

198
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:25,408
Are you threatening me?

199
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:27,618
Don't put it so crudely.

200
00:18:27,702 --> 00:18:32,581
I had ventured to hope that you and I
together, no longer as master and pupil,

201
00:18:32,664 --> 00:18:37,293
but as fellow scientists, might probe
the mysteries of life and death...

202
00:18:37,378 --> 00:18:39,087
Never. No further.

203
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:42,214
...and reach a goal
undreamed of by science.

204
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:46,220
I can't make any further experiments.
I've had a terrible lesson.

205
00:18:46,302 --> 00:18:48,513
That is sad, very sad.

206
00:18:49,055 --> 00:18:51,724
But you and I have gone too far to stop.

207
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:54,810
Nor can it be stopped so easily.

208
00:18:54,894 --> 00:18:57,812
I also have continued
with my experiments.

209
00:18:57,897 --> 00:19:00,399
That is why I am here tonight.

210
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:02,985
You must see "my" creation.

211
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:07,281
Have you also succeeded
in bringing life to the dead?

212
00:19:07,364 --> 00:19:10,785
If you, Herr Baron, will do me the honour
of visiting my humble abode,

213
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:14,245
I think you will be interested
in what I have to show you.

214
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:19,583
After 20 years of secret scientific
research, and countless failures,

215
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:25,715
I also have created life,
as we say, in God's own image.

216
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:29,176
I must know. When can I see it?

217
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,721
I thought you might change your mind.

218
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,722
Why not tonight? It is not very late.

219
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:39,686
- Is it far?
- No, but you will need a coat.

220
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:52,573
I think your coachman
had better wait here.

221
00:20:12,801 --> 00:20:15,010
Won't you sit down, Herr Baron?

222
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:23,768
Before I show you the results
of my trifling experiments,

223
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:26,480
I would like to drink to our partnership.

224
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:30,860
Do you like gin? It is my only weakness.

225
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:38,074
To a new world of gods and monsters.

226
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:45,498
Creation of life is enthralling,

227
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:48,293
distinctly enthralling, is it not?

228
00:20:48,376 --> 00:20:52,337
I cannot account precisely
for all that I am going to show you.

229
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:56,467
But perhaps now that
you are my partner, you can.

230
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:40,549
My experiments did not turn out
quite like yours, Henry.

231
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,849
But science, like love, has her
little surprises, as you shall see.

232
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:51,018
Good heavens, Doctor. What are these?

233
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:54,105
There is a pleasing variety
about my exhibits.

234
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,065
My first experiment was so lovely

235
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,402
that we made her a queen.

236
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,617
Charming, don't you think?

237
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,412
Then, of course, we had to have a king.

238
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:18,377
Now he's so madly in love with her
that we have to segregate them.

239
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:23,924
Now now. I have to be
very careful with the king.

240
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:29,429
Now, behave.

241
00:22:29,513 --> 00:22:33,432
My next production looked
so disapprovingly at the other two

242
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,186
that they made him an archbishop.

243
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:38,730
He seems to be asleep.
I must wake him up.

244
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:45,819
The next one is the very devil.

245
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:48,280
Very bizarre, this little chap.

246
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:52,868
There's a certain resemblance to me,
don't you think? Or do I flatter myself?

247
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:55,454
I took a great deal of pains with him.

248
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:59,373
Sometimes I have wondered whether
life wouldn't be much more amusing

249
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,669
if we were all devils,

250
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:05,629
and no nonsense about
angels and being good.

251
00:23:06,256 --> 00:23:08,465
Oh, there's the king out again.

252
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:13,638
Even royal amours are a nuisance.

253
00:23:25,024 --> 00:23:27,943
Poor Archbishop. He has his hands full.

254
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,029
There. That'll keep you quiet.

255
00:23:32,156 --> 00:23:35,617
My little ballerina is charming,
but such a bore.

256
00:23:35,701 --> 00:23:38,537
She'll only dance to
Mendelssohn's "Spring Song",

257
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:40,705
and it gets so monotonous.

258
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:43,707
My next is very conventional, I'm afraid.

259
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:46,793
But you can never tell
how these things will turn out.

260
00:23:46,878 --> 00:23:49,880
It was an experiment with seaweed.

261
00:23:49,964 --> 00:23:52,508
Normal size has been my difficulty.

262
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:54,843
You did achieve size.

263
00:23:54,927 --> 00:23:57,179
I need to work that out with you.

264
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:07,271
But this isn't science.

265
00:24:07,355 --> 00:24:09,398
It's more like black magic.

266
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:12,735
You think I'm mad. Perhaps I am.

267
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,737
But listen, Henry Frankenstein,

268
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:18,949
while you were digging in your graves
piecing together dead tissues,

269
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:23,202
I, my dear pupil, went for my material
to the source of life.

270
00:24:23,454 --> 00:24:30,209
I grew my creatures, like cultures.
Grew them as nature does, from seed.

271
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:35,382
But, still, you did achieve
results that I have missed. Now, think.

272
00:24:35,465 --> 00:24:39,136
What a world-astounding
collaboration we should be,

273
00:24:39,468 --> 00:24:41,554
you and I, together.

274
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:45,432
No. No, no, no.

275
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,978
Leave the charnel house
and follow the lead of nature,

276
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:52,188
or of God, if you like your Bible stories.

277
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:56,693
Male and female, created He them.

278
00:24:57,736 --> 00:25:00,405
Be fruitful and multiply.

279
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:06,577
Create a race, a man-made race
upon the face of the earth. Why not?

280
00:25:06,662 --> 00:25:09,539
I daren't. I daren't even think
of such a thing.

281
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:12,666
Our mad dream is only half realised.

282
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,502
Alone you have created a man.

283
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:20,173
Now together we will create his mate.

284
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,093
You mean...?

285
00:25:23,386 --> 00:25:26,847
Yes, a woman.

286
00:25:26,931 --> 00:25:29,975
That should be really interesting.

287
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:55,763
Please don't touch me!

288
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:03,896
- There she is! Quick!

289
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,940
There he is. Shoot.

290
00:27:14,991 --> 00:27:19,828
Run to the village, quick.
It's the monster. Tell the burgomaster.

291
00:27:34,634 --> 00:27:37,177
- What is it now?
- The monster! He's in the woods.

292
00:27:37,262 --> 00:27:40,890
Get the bloodhounds. Raise all the
men you can, lock the women indoors

293
00:27:40,973 --> 00:27:43,059
and wait for me.

294
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:50,232
Now then! Monster, indeed!
I'll show him. Follow me.

295
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,749
Where is he?

296
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,924
Bind him securely.
I don't want anything slipshod.

297
00:29:02,008 --> 00:29:05,719
Tie his feet first. His feet first!

298
00:29:05,803 --> 00:29:09,014
I get no cooperation. None at all.

299
00:29:09,098 --> 00:29:11,976
Have you got him? That's what
I want to know. Have you got him?

300
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,186
Of course we've got him,
my good woman.

301
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:17,397
A good job too.
Mind he don't get loose again.

302
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:20,442
He might do some damage
and hurt somebody.

303
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:25,071
- Bring him down when you've bound him.
- You want any help there? I'll bind him!

304
00:30:19,581 --> 00:30:23,000
Now take him down to the old dungeon
and put him in chains.

305
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,229
There you are.
Find some rope and tie him up.

306
00:30:45,564 --> 00:30:47,816
Come on, then. Get back to your work.

307
00:30:56,992 --> 00:30:58,451
Keep still.

308
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:10,003
That's quite enough. Come and lock your
doors. We can't take all day over this.

309
00:31:14,508 --> 00:31:19,345
I'd hate to find him under my bed at night.
He's a nightmare in the daylight, he is.

310
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:22,056
Get away, there! Clear that window!

311
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,644
Hah! You mind your own business and
see he doesn't get out. He's dangerous.

312
00:31:26,727 --> 00:31:29,313
Now I can get back
to more important duties.

313
00:31:29,397 --> 00:31:30,939
- Way past our hours.
- Hm?

314
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:34,317
- The night, sir.
- Monster, indeed.

315
00:31:34,402 --> 00:31:36,486
Tush, tush.

316
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,466
He's loose! Shoot him!

317
00:32:15,316 --> 00:32:17,317
Help! He's loose!

318
00:32:19,694 --> 00:32:22,196
Go to your homes.
Just an escaped lunatic.

319
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:26,117
Merely wanted someone to handle it,
that's all. Quite harmless.

320
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:37,836
Shoot him! Why don't you shoot him?

321
00:32:49,764 --> 00:32:51,932
Where's Frieda?

322
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,102
Frieda! Frieda!

323
00:32:58,063 --> 00:33:01,232
- Frieda? Where's Frieda?
- She just left.

324
00:33:01,317 --> 00:33:03,860
- Oh, look!

325
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:09,033
Frieda! Oh, what have they done to you?

326
00:33:11,493 --> 00:33:13,954
Mrs Newman. Oh! Come on!

327
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:26,090
- Poor old Newman.
- Where's his wife, Frau Newman?

328
00:33:26,174 --> 00:33:27,632
Frau Newman.

329
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,803
- Frau Newman!
- Frau Newman!

330
00:33:31,888 --> 00:33:33,931
Frau Newman!

331
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,270
There's another one in there.

332
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:43,773
- Frau Newman.

333
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,819
Aurora, you stay close to me.

334
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,951
We'd better get away from these parts.

335
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:57,870
- It isn't safe.
- Why?

336
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:01,081
I'm frightened. The monster.

337
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:04,961
Ah, there's no danger. He's safe in jail
and they'll keep him there.

338
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,462
Where's the pepper and salt?
We got no pepper and salt.

339
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,840
All right, Mother. I'll get it.

340
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,385
Don't worry. You shall have your meat.

341
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,927
Ah.

342
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:36,156
Get away from there.

343
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:49,476
Who's there?

344
00:36:36,603 --> 00:36:39,021
Who is it?

345
00:36:39,147 --> 00:36:42,108
You're welcome, my friend,
whoever you are.

346
00:36:46,363 --> 00:36:48,447
Who are you?

347
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,409
I think you're a stranger to me.

348
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:57,748
I cannot see you. I cannot see anything.

349
00:36:58,707 --> 00:37:02,001
You must please excuse me,
but I am blind.

350
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,261
Come in, my poor friend.

351
00:37:11,344 --> 00:37:13,430
No one will hurt you here.

352
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,599
If you're in trouble,
perhaps I can help you.

353
00:37:17,684 --> 00:37:21,521
But you need not tell me about it
if you don't want to.

354
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:23,730
- What's the matter?

355
00:37:26,734 --> 00:37:28,818
You're hurt, my poor friend.

356
00:37:29,445 --> 00:37:30,778
Come.

357
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:53,091
Sit down.

358
00:37:54,677 --> 00:37:57,513
Now tell me, who are you?

359
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:02,475
I don't understand.

360
00:38:04,436 --> 00:38:06,522
Can you not speak?

361
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:10,775
It's strange.

362
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:13,902
Perhaps... perhaps you're afflicted too.

363
00:38:16,072 --> 00:38:19,284
I cannot see and you cannot speak.

364
00:38:19,409 --> 00:38:21,493
Is that it?

365
00:38:23,371 --> 00:38:27,458
If you understand what I'm saying,
put your hand on my shoulder.

366
00:38:31,671 --> 00:38:33,755
That is good.

367
00:38:36,008 --> 00:38:38,551
No, you stay here.

368
00:38:39,678 --> 00:38:41,762
I'll get you some food.

369
00:38:53,023 --> 00:38:55,442
We shall be friends.

370
00:38:55,902 --> 00:39:02,032
I have prayed many times
for God to send me a friend.

371
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,621
It's very lonely here,
and it's been a long time

372
00:39:07,704 --> 00:39:11,207
since any human being came into this hut.

373
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:14,293
I shall look after you,

374
00:39:14,377 --> 00:39:17,588
and you will comfort me.

375
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:26,931
Now you must lie down,

376
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,224
and go to sleep.

377
00:39:37,774 --> 00:39:41,611
Yes, yes, now you must sleep.

378
00:39:47,784 --> 00:39:49,868
Our Father, I thank thee,

379
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:56,583
that, in thy great mercy, thou hast
taken pity on my great loneliness.

380
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:59,378
And now, out of the silence of the night,

381
00:39:59,419 --> 00:40:03,215
hath brought two
of thy lonely children together,

382
00:40:03,298 --> 00:40:05,842
and sent me a friend

383
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:11,889
to be a light to mine eyes
and a comfort in time of trouble.

384
00:40:11,974 --> 00:40:13,766
Amen.

385
00:40:36,496 --> 00:40:39,248
And now for our lesson.

386
00:40:39,332 --> 00:40:42,460
Remember, this is bread.

387
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:44,127
Bread.

388
00:40:46,673 --> 00:40:48,757
Bread.

389
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:54,054
And this is wine... to drink.

390
00:40:55,014 --> 00:40:57,098
- Drink.
- Drink.

391
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:05,607
Good. Good.

392
00:41:05,691 --> 00:41:08,277
We are friends, you and I.

393
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:11,528
- Friends.
- Friends.

394
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:14,615
- Good.
- Good!

395
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:18,995
And now for a smoke.

396
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:30,547
No, no. This is good.

397
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,591
Smoke. You try.

398
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,594
Smoke.

399
00:41:41,891 --> 00:41:43,975
Good, good.

400
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,604
Good.

401
00:41:49,732 --> 00:41:53,068
Before you came, I was all alone.

402
00:41:53,152 --> 00:41:55,570
It is bad to be alone.

403
00:41:55,654 --> 00:41:57,781
Alone.

404
00:41:57,865 --> 00:41:59,616
Bad.

405
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:04,995
Friend. Good. Friend. Good.

406
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:09,207
Now, come here.

407
00:42:13,129 --> 00:42:15,213
And what is this?

408
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:18,759
This is wood for the fire.

409
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,594
Wood.

410
00:42:23,597 --> 00:42:25,806
- And this is fire.

411
00:42:27,017 --> 00:42:30,144
No, no. Fire is good.

412
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:33,606
Fire no good.

413
00:42:35,483 --> 00:42:38,527
There is good and there is bad.

414
00:42:38,612 --> 00:42:41,280
Good. Bad.

415
00:42:43,907 --> 00:42:45,993
Good.

416
00:42:48,705 --> 00:42:50,831
Music?

417
00:43:15,646 --> 00:43:18,858
Can you tell us how to get out
of this wood? We've lost our way.

418
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,234
Come in, friends, and rest a while.

419
00:43:26,824 --> 00:43:28,908
- Look.
- It's the monster.

420
00:43:36,749 --> 00:43:40,502
What are you doing? This is my friend.

421
00:43:40,587 --> 00:43:44,215
Friend? This is the fiend that's
been murdering half the countryside.

422
00:43:44,298 --> 00:43:46,675
Good heavens, man, can't you see?

423
00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:49,136
Oh, he's blind.

424
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:53,348
He isn't human. Frankenstein
made him out of dead bodies.

425
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:11,823
My friend. Why do you do this?

426
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:23,919
Friend.

427
00:44:31,343 --> 00:44:32,677
Look.

428
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:32,983
Which way did he go?

429
00:45:33,068 --> 00:45:36,362
This way! He's gone this way!

430
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:03,470
Friend.

431
00:46:22,656 --> 00:46:26,159
- I can smell the ghosts already.
- I never could stand graves.

432
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:28,119
Shut up and follow me.

433
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,728
Read the inscription. What does it say?

434
00:46:59,899 --> 00:47:04,694
"Died 1899. Maddalena Ernestine,
beloved daughter of..."

435
00:47:04,779 --> 00:47:07,490
Oh, never mind that. How old was she?

436
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:11,285
"Aged 19 years, three months."

437
00:47:11,368 --> 00:47:13,704
Well, that's the one. Get to work.

438
00:47:14,622 --> 00:47:17,458
- What are you waiting for?
- Mercy on us.

439
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:21,462
- You want me to send you to the gallows?
- Could be no worse than this.

440
00:47:21,545 --> 00:47:24,254
- Well, are you ready?
- Yes.

441
00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:26,423
Here goes.

442
00:47:45,234 --> 00:47:48,653
Pretty little thing, in her way, wasn't she?

443
00:47:48,738 --> 00:47:50,530
I hope her bones are firm.

444
00:47:52,157 --> 00:47:55,034
- It seems lighter now.
- Yes.

445
00:47:57,203 --> 00:47:59,580
Well, Doctor, I guess that's all for tonight.

446
00:47:59,664 --> 00:48:02,916
- Can we go home now?
- Yes. I shall wait here for a bit.

447
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,168
I rather like this place.

448
00:48:05,253 --> 00:48:07,839
- Be careful nobody sees you leave.
- We know.

449
00:48:07,921 --> 00:48:11,925
- And leave me that lantern down there.
- All right, all right.

450
00:48:23,312 --> 00:48:25,689
If there's more like this,
what do you say, pal?

451
00:48:25,772 --> 00:48:28,065
We give ourselves up
and let 'em hang us?

452
00:48:28,149 --> 00:48:32,195
- That goes for me too.
- This is no life for murderers.

453
00:48:41,412 --> 00:48:43,621
I give you the monster.

454
00:49:08,187 --> 00:49:10,230
Oh.

455
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:14,651
I thought I was alone. Good evening.

456
00:49:14,735 --> 00:49:16,819
Smoke.

457
00:49:18,905 --> 00:49:22,408
- Friend.
- Yes, I hope so.

458
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:26,204
Have a cigar. They are my only weakness.

459
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:30,792
Good, good.

460
00:49:41,927 --> 00:49:44,304
Drink. Good.

461
00:49:44,388 --> 00:49:46,472
Good.

462
00:50:00,695 --> 00:50:05,365
You make man like me?

463
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:07,952
No. Woman.

464
00:50:08,953 --> 00:50:12,747
- Friend for you.
- Woman?

465
00:50:12,832 --> 00:50:15,584
Friend. Yes.

466
00:50:16,502 --> 00:50:20,421
I want friend. Like me.

467
00:50:20,505 --> 00:50:22,882
I think you can be very useful.

468
00:50:22,966 --> 00:50:27,511
And you will add a little force
to the argument, if necessary.

469
00:50:27,595 --> 00:50:32,224
Do you know who Henry Frankenstein is?
And who you are?

470
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:34,476
Yes. I know.

471
00:50:35,687 --> 00:50:38,355
Made me from dead.

472
00:50:39,815 --> 00:50:41,899
I love dead.

473
00:50:43,194 --> 00:50:45,362
Hate living.

474
00:50:45,445 --> 00:50:48,114
You're wise in your generation.

475
00:50:48,198 --> 00:50:53,327
We must have a long talk, and then
I have an important call to make.

476
00:50:57,415 --> 00:51:01,584
Woman. Friend.

477
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:05,588
Wife.

478
00:51:09,802 --> 00:51:12,261
That Dr Pretorius is here again, sir.

479
00:51:12,346 --> 00:51:14,514
There, I knew it.

480
00:51:14,598 --> 00:51:18,267
- Send him away. I won't see him.
- I certainly will.

481
00:51:21,688 --> 00:51:23,606
Good evening, Henry.

482
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:27,944
Baroness, I've not yet had the opportunity

483
00:51:28,027 --> 00:51:31,488
of offering you
my congratulations on your marriage.

484
00:51:31,572 --> 00:51:35,284
- Pray accept them now.
- Dr Pretorius.

485
00:51:35,367 --> 00:51:38,370
I don't know what your business is
but, whatever it may be,

486
00:51:38,453 --> 00:51:41,497
I tell you frankly
that I am not frightened of it or of you.

487
00:51:41,582 --> 00:51:45,960
Henry's been very ill. He's in no state
to be alarmed or annoyed.

488
00:51:46,044 --> 00:51:48,421
Your visit now is most unwelcome.

489
00:51:51,091 --> 00:51:55,094
Henry, I heard the carriage drive up.
I'll see that the baggage is put in.

490
00:51:55,386 --> 00:51:57,930
Then we're leaving.

491
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:06,230
I think you know why I am here, Henry.

492
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:12,694
All the necessary preparations are made.
My part in the experiments is complete.

493
00:52:12,777 --> 00:52:18,741
I have created, by my method, a perfect
human brain-already living, but dormant.

494
00:52:18,825 --> 00:52:22,662
Everything is now ready for you and me
to begin our supreme collaboration.

495
00:52:22,746 --> 00:52:26,790
No, no. Don't tell me of it.
I don't want to hear.

496
00:52:26,874 --> 00:52:31,294
I've changed my mind. I won't do it.

497
00:52:31,336 --> 00:52:33,088
I expected this.

498
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:37,092
I thought we might need
another assistant.

499
00:52:38,302 --> 00:52:40,386
Perhaps "he" can persuade you.

500
00:52:41,012 --> 00:52:44,181
- Nothing can persuade me.
- We shall see.

501
00:52:46,143 --> 00:52:51,313
- No! Not that!
- Oh, he's harmless, except when crossed.

502
00:52:58,196 --> 00:53:00,030
Frankenstein.

503
00:53:01,282 --> 00:53:04,743
Yes, there have been developments
since he came to me.

504
00:53:14,419 --> 00:53:16,671
Sit down.

505
00:53:19,674 --> 00:53:23,345
- What do you want?
- You know.

506
00:53:23,427 --> 00:53:25,846
- This is your work.
- Yes.

507
00:53:25,929 --> 00:53:28,097
I'll have no hand
in such a monstrous thing.

508
00:53:28,182 --> 00:53:31,601
- Yes. Must.
- Get him out.

509
00:53:31,685 --> 00:53:33,687
I won't even discuss it until he's gone.

510
00:53:34,147 --> 00:53:36,231
Go now.

511
00:53:40,026 --> 00:53:42,112
Go.

512
00:53:52,914 --> 00:53:58,084
- Must do it.
- Nothing can make me go on with it.

513
00:54:03,549 --> 00:54:05,801
Now.

514
00:54:23,735 --> 00:54:26,653
Put the bags in the carriage
and I'll be out in a moment.

515
00:54:26,778 --> 00:54:30,782
Go and tell the master to hurry,
Minnie, or we shall lose the train.

516
00:54:33,702 --> 00:54:36,705
Excuse me for being so nervous, milady,

517
00:54:36,788 --> 00:54:39,374
but I don't like leaving you alone.

518
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:43,795
- Oh, nonsense, Minnie, I shall be all right.
- I hope so, milady.

519
00:54:49,758 --> 00:54:51,844
Is that you, Henry?

520
00:55:10,987 --> 00:55:12,989
Henry! Henry, help!

521
00:55:13,072 --> 00:55:15,783
Henry!

522
00:55:15,867 --> 00:55:18,076
Milady!

523
00:55:19,579 --> 00:55:23,791
- Elizabeth.

524
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:29,254
What is it? What's the matter?

525
00:55:29,337 --> 00:55:31,631
Oh, sir, she's gone!

526
00:55:31,882 --> 00:55:34,425
The monster, he's got her!

527
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:37,554
I saw it. The baroness is gone!

528
00:55:37,929 --> 00:55:43,058
This is Pretorius' doing. Quick, search
parties. There's not a moment to lose.

529
00:55:45,979 --> 00:55:49,065
I charge you,
as you value your mistress' life,

530
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:52,443
to do nothing
and say nothing of this episode.

531
00:55:52,526 --> 00:55:55,738
I assure you that the baroness
will be safely returned,

532
00:55:55,821 --> 00:55:58,323
if you will leave everything to me.

533
00:55:59,283 --> 00:56:03,202
Nothing, that is, except what he demands.

534
00:56:26,767 --> 00:56:28,853
I can find no trace of Elizabeth.

535
00:56:30,313 --> 00:56:33,190
Oh, I admit I'm beaten.

536
00:56:34,107 --> 00:56:36,901
But if you can bring her back,

537
00:56:36,985 --> 00:56:39,237
I'll do anything that you want.

538
00:56:39,321 --> 00:56:42,907
Are you ready to complete with me
this final experiment?

539
00:56:42,991 --> 00:56:45,618
- What about Elizabeth?
- She is well,

540
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:49,539
and will be safely returned
if you will proceed.

541
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,374
- I'm ready.
- Ah.

542
00:57:06,763 --> 00:57:09,515
Mind the steps.
They're a bit slimy, I expect.

543
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,683
I think it's a charming house.

544
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,784
It is interesting to think
that once upon a time

545
00:57:28,867 --> 00:57:32,996
we should have been burnt at the stake
as wizards for this experiment.

546
00:57:33,122 --> 00:57:36,166
Doctor, I think the heart is beating.

547
00:57:40,336 --> 00:57:43,297
Look. It's beating.

548
00:57:43,381 --> 00:57:47,677
- But the rhythm of the beat is uneven.
- Increase the saline solution.

549
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:55,893
- Is there any life yet?
- No, not life itself yet.

550
00:57:55,977 --> 00:57:58,645
This is only the simulacrum of life.

551
00:57:58,729 --> 00:58:02,357
This action only responds
when the current is applied.

552
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:07,194
We must be patient. The heart is more
complex than any other part of the body.

553
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,907
Look. The beat is increasing.

554
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:13,409
Yes...

555
00:58:13,993 --> 00:58:16,954
- It's stopped.
- Shall I increase the current?

556
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:22,417
This heart is useless.

557
00:58:22,543 --> 00:58:28,006
I must have another.
And it must be sound and young.

558
00:58:30,217 --> 00:58:32,301
Karl.

559
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:36,597
You must go to your friend
at the accident hospital.

560
00:58:36,682 --> 00:58:41,144
What we need is a female victim
of sudden death. Can you do it?

561
00:58:41,228 --> 00:58:43,855
If you promise me a thousand crowns.

562
00:58:43,939 --> 00:58:47,358
It will be well worth it,
and the baron will pay.

563
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:51,028
- Yes, yes. Go and get it.
- I'll try.

564
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:02,622
There are always
accidental deaths occurring.

565
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,999
Always.

566
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,252
I'll get your heart.

567
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:10,713
I'll go into that room, I'll go into that room
and I'll take my knife out.

568
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,590
I'll get her. I'll hold her down
and there she'll be.

569
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,092
Where, I ask you? Where will she be?

570
00:59:17,594 --> 00:59:19,680
A thousand crowns.

571
00:59:32,442 --> 00:59:35,986
It's beating perfectly. Just as in life.

572
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:39,699
- Oh, if only I can keep it going until...
- It was a very fresh one.

573
00:59:41,993 --> 00:59:44,329
Where did you get it?

574
00:59:44,412 --> 00:59:47,498
I gave the gendarme 50 crowns.

575
00:59:47,581 --> 00:59:51,084
- What gendarme?
- It was a...

576
00:59:52,961 --> 00:59:55,880
- police case.
- Yes, very sad.

577
00:59:55,965 --> 00:59:59,593
Only, we can't bother about that now.
Can I do anything?

578
00:59:59,676 --> 01:00:04,221
No, no, no! I can work better alone.

579
01:00:22,364 --> 01:00:24,741
- Work.
- Where's Elizabeth?

580
01:00:24,826 --> 01:00:28,662
- Have you brought her?
- She wait. I wait.

581
01:00:28,745 --> 01:00:31,747
I'm exhausted. I must get sleep.

582
01:00:31,831 --> 01:00:35,459
Work. Finish. Then sleep.

583
01:00:35,544 --> 01:00:39,297
But I can't work like this.
He must go away. Send him away.

584
01:00:39,381 --> 01:00:41,757
I'll settle him for a little while.

585
01:00:44,052 --> 01:00:46,136
Drink.

586
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:02,236
Drink.

587
01:01:05,781 --> 01:01:07,990
Good.

588
01:01:26,758 --> 01:01:28,842
That'll keep you quiet.

589
01:01:30,094 --> 01:01:32,680
Elizabeth-she's dead.

590
01:01:32,764 --> 01:01:35,391
Elizabeth is alive and she is well.

591
01:01:35,891 --> 01:01:39,310
- I don't believe you.
- I have proof.

592
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,398
- Proof?
- In a few moments from now,

593
01:01:42,481 --> 01:01:46,443
she will speak to you from where she is
through this electrical machine.

594
01:01:46,777 --> 01:01:49,696
- Where is she?
- Not far from here.

595
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:55,160
Speak, and she will hear you and answer.

596
01:01:55,953 --> 01:01:59,205
Yes, yes, this is Henry.

597
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:04,668
Henry, yes, I'm safe. But, oh, Henry,
how long? Come for me. I'm in...

598
01:02:04,752 --> 01:02:07,213
Elizabeth? Elizabeth!

599
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:11,382
- She's gone.
- That is all now. But you heard her.

600
01:02:11,467 --> 01:02:13,844
Yes, she's alive.

601
01:02:13,928 --> 01:02:17,514
As soon as our work is completed
she will be returned to you.

602
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:24,021
The heart is beating more regularly now.

603
01:02:26,022 --> 01:02:29,150
Yes, it's been beating for nine hours.

604
01:02:30,568 --> 01:02:33,362
Not yet, but soon...

605
01:02:33,446 --> 01:02:37,325
- And the brain?
- Perfect and already in position.

606
01:02:37,408 --> 01:02:40,786
- Then we are almost ready.
- Almost.

607
01:02:42,455 --> 01:02:44,664
Shall we put the heart in now?

608
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,126
- Yes.
- Ludwig.

609
01:03:05,351 --> 01:03:07,560
It's beating quite normally now.

610
01:03:07,645 --> 01:03:09,731
Bring it over.

611
01:03:23,202 --> 01:03:26,329
- The storm is rising.
- All right.

612
01:03:29,082 --> 01:03:31,416
The air is heavy with electricity.

613
01:03:31,501 --> 01:03:33,628
It's going to be a terrific storm.

614
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:37,716
We shall be ready.

615
01:03:43,012 --> 01:03:47,641
Isn't it amazing, Henry,
that lying here within this cowl

616
01:03:47,725 --> 01:03:50,893
is an artificially developed human brain?

617
01:03:50,977 --> 01:03:56,106
Each cell, each convolution ready,
waiting for life to come.

618
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:01,822
Look. The storm is coming up
over the mountains.

619
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:05,532
- It will be here soon.
- The kites. Are the kites ready?

620
01:04:05,617 --> 01:04:08,536
- Yes.
- Send them up as soon as the wind rises.

621
01:04:08,619 --> 01:04:12,163
- Hurry, hurry!
- The kites, the kites, get 'em ready.

622
01:04:14,792 --> 01:04:16,918
Ludwig!

623
01:04:29,055 --> 01:04:30,973
He wants the kites!

624
01:04:35,436 --> 01:04:37,520
Stand back.

625
01:04:48,532 --> 01:04:50,618
Careful on the roof!

626
01:04:57,999 --> 01:05:00,042
The big diffuser!

627
01:05:10,469 --> 01:05:12,596
Wires! Slip down your wires!

628
01:05:20,729 --> 01:05:23,315
All right. Stop your winches.
I'm coming up!

629
01:05:33,115 --> 01:05:36,659
- Now, off with the kites!
- You take number two, Ludwig.

630
01:05:37,704 --> 01:05:40,497
- Have you made your connections?
- Yes.

631
01:05:40,581 --> 01:05:42,665
Stand by!

632
01:05:43,584 --> 01:05:45,586
Let go of number one!

633
01:05:48,631 --> 01:05:50,715
Let her go!

634
01:06:50,021 --> 01:06:52,273
It's coming up!

635
01:07:57,001 --> 01:07:58,919
- Go back. Go back down!

636
01:07:59,003 --> 01:08:01,087
Go back!

637
01:08:01,964 --> 01:08:04,925
No! Get away! Frankenstein!

638
01:08:05,009 --> 01:08:07,677
Get away! Get away!

639
01:08:12,641 --> 01:08:14,600
Don't come near me!

640
01:08:16,186 --> 01:08:19,272
Get away! Don't! No! No!

641
01:08:21,733 --> 01:08:23,859
Don't! Don't!

642
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:56,557
Raise the cosmic diffuser.

643
01:09:02,563 --> 01:09:04,731
Remove the diffuser bands.

644
01:09:28,254 --> 01:09:31,090
She's alive! Alive!

645
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:23,515
The bride of Frankenstein.

646
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:17,522
Friend?

647
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,194
Friend?

648
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,466
- Stand back. Stand back.

649
01:12:12,243 --> 01:12:16,371
She hate me. Like others.

650
01:12:29,759 --> 01:12:32,636
- Look out! The lever!
- Get away from that lever!

651
01:12:33,095 --> 01:12:35,722
You'll blow us all to atoms.

652
01:12:37,725 --> 01:12:39,309
Henry!

653
01:12:39,392 --> 01:12:42,144
Open the door! Henry!

654
01:12:42,228 --> 01:12:46,065
- Get back! Get back!
- I won't unless you come!

655
01:12:47,276 --> 01:12:49,610
But I can't leave them! I can't!

656
01:12:49,694 --> 01:12:53,488
Yes, go! You live!

657
01:12:53,781 --> 01:12:55,990
Go!

658
01:12:57,076 --> 01:12:59,369
You stay.

659
01:12:59,454 --> 01:13:01,705
We belong dead.

660
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,002
Darling, darling.
