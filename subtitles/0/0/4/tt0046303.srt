169

What about me, Ma?

170
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:35,159
What's the matter, Marian?

171
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:37,592
Nothing.

172

Where's Mr. Shane going?

175
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,359
He didn't
even say goodbye.

176
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,362
He's not going, Joey.

177
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,024
He wouldn't go
without taking that.

178
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,033
I'm going outside
with him.

Did you ask him to stay the night,
Joe?

180
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,673
Well, I'll... I'll
do that right now.

00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,713
Well, I'll be doggone.

Joe, why don't you
hitch up a team?

00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:26,277

it beat us.

nothing that'll do

it was me?

You're to stay

I wish you'd stay here.

Come in and put
your clothes on.

to hitch up the team

Get off the bed, Joey.
Go on.

Well, he's trading at the store,
not holding it up.

But why, Pa? Honest.
Why didn't he?

493
00:30:17,171 --> 00:30:20,106
if you get
to liking him too much.

494
00:30:22,978 --> 00:30:24,411
All right, Marian,

495
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,913
you're pretty enough!

496
00:30:25,981 --> 00:30:28,779
Come on, now,
you're holding everybody up!

497
00:30:28,851 --> 00:30:31,786
I vish she vould hurry
so ve could get going.

498
00:30:31,854 --> 00:30:34,084
I don't like
this business.

499
00:30:35,392 --> 00:30:37,826
Joey, get in the wagon, Son!

500
00:30:48,773 --> 00:30:51,708
One thing a married man
has got to get used to

501
00:30:51,776 --> 00:30:53,209
is waiting for women.

502
00:30:53,277 --> 00:30:55,472
Hurry up, Ma!

503
00:30:55,546 --> 00:30:56,979
[Joe]
Here she comes.

504
00:30:57,048 --> 00:30:58,481
Good afternoon,
Mrs. Starett.

505
00:30:58,549 --> 00:30:59,538
Hello.

506
00:30:59,617 --> 00:31:01,983
Sometimes the waiting
is worth it.

507
00:31:02,053 --> 00:31:03,487
Take care, Shane,

508
00:31:03,555 --> 00:31:06,683
you get a woman
that's worth waiting for.

509
00:31:06,758 --> 00:31:08,453
Water is sure good.

510
00:31:13,098 --> 00:31:14,531
Think I can get ready

511
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:17,535
in the time it takes
to hitch up a team?

512
00:31:17,603 --> 00:31:20,538
Hold on. We wanted to see
how pretty you were.

513
00:31:20,606 --> 00:31:22,198
Couldn't wait.
Come on in.

514
00:31:25,178 --> 00:31:27,373
All set?

515
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:38,253
[Thunder]

516
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:40,690
Hyah! Hyah!

517
00:31:40,761 --> 00:31:41,693
Come on!

518
00:31:41,762 --> 00:31:42,694
Hyah!

519
00:31:42,763 --> 00:31:43,695
Hyah!

520
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:05,177
Come on, girl!

521
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:07,085
Hello, Ernie!

522
00:32:07,156 --> 00:32:08,623
Good morning, Joe.

523
00:32:08,691 --> 00:32:10,124
You all set, Fred?

524
00:32:10,192 --> 00:32:11,625
Yeah, reckon we are.

525
00:32:11,694 --> 00:32:12,787
Where's Stonewall?

526
00:32:12,863 --> 00:32:14,888
Thought he was
coming with us.

527
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:16,899
He got thirsty
and went on.

528
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:19,458
Said he had business
that couldn't wait.

529
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:23,028
I'd like to go, too,
but I got to mind the girls.

530
00:32:23,106 --> 00:32:24,539
Bye.

531
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:26,634
Goodbye.

532
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,144
Come on.

533
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:29,645
Come on, Red.

534
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:30,646
Come on.

535
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:31,807
Goodbye, Marian.

536
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,282
Bye-bye.

537
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,784
We'll come out later.

538
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:35,978
Goodbye.

539
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:41,056
Bye-bye.

540
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,320
Goodbye.

541
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:45,829
Goodbye.

542
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,951
Stonewall, what are you doing
in town ahead of us?

543
00:33:45,027 --> 00:33:47,325
I had some business
to attend to.

544
00:33:47,396 --> 00:33:49,160
We can't buy a drink.

545
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:50,461
Get off that horse.

546
00:33:50,534 --> 00:33:52,525
You're acting
like a fool.

547
00:33:54,738 --> 00:33:56,228
[Bell Rings]

548
00:34:03,448 --> 00:34:05,382
A whole bunch came in.

549
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,543
They brought
their women with them

550
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:09,018
to protect them.

551
00:34:09,087 --> 00:34:10,520
My jars come yet?

552
00:34:10,588 --> 00:34:12,283
Heard you were
coming in.

553
00:34:12,357 --> 00:34:14,621
What can I
do you for?

554
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:17,059
My, my, my.

555
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:21,361
What will they
think of next?

556
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:23,094
Susan.

557
00:34:24,603 --> 00:34:27,333
You bring that list of things
your mother wanted?

558
00:34:27,406 --> 00:34:29,806
The coal-oil cars
in the wagon.

559
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,241
Run and get it.

560
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:34,144
My voman wanted we should
get together on the 4th of July.

561
00:34:34,214 --> 00:34:36,079
Ja, we make
big celebration.

562
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:38,083
I already
tell your wife.

563
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:40,085
That's just
what we need...

564
00:34:40,153 --> 00:34:41,415
a real get-together.

565
00:34:41,488 --> 00:34:42,921
It's Joe Starett's
anniversary.

566
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,321
Got to celebrate that.

567
00:34:44,392 --> 00:34:46,121
We'll have a big party.

568
00:34:46,193 --> 00:34:48,787
Oh, and... and... and,
Mr. Grafton...

569
00:34:48,863 --> 00:34:50,296
Have you got gunpowder?

570
00:34:50,364 --> 00:34:52,059
We need it
for fireworks.

571
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:55,569
I'll barter the two chickens
I brought for it.

572
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,331
We'll talk
about that later.

573
00:34:57,405 --> 00:34:59,670
What do I get
for the empty?

574
00:34:59,741 --> 00:35:00,799
The usual.

575
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:03,409
Thank you.

576
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:05,275
Give the bottle to Will.

577
00:35:05,347 --> 00:35:09,249
I need white flour
and 4 pounds of coffee.

578
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:10,649
Joey...

579
00:35:14,357 --> 00:35:16,291
Let me take it in.

580
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:18,259
You come, too, Shane.

581
00:35:18,328 --> 00:35:19,761
Thank you.

582
00:35:21,898 --> 00:35:24,162
Ve'll talk
about that later.

583
00:35:29,406 --> 00:35:32,136
Well, now, look
what we got.

584
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:43,317
That's one
of the new ones.

585
00:35:43,388 --> 00:35:46,152
They call him Sody Pop.

586
00:35:46,224 --> 00:35:48,021
Deal me out.

587
00:35:48,093 --> 00:35:50,027
Why, what's the matter,
Pete?

588
00:35:50,095 --> 00:35:51,824
Just say
I'm superstitious,

589
00:35:51,896 --> 00:35:53,262
that's all.

590
00:35:59,171 --> 00:36:02,607
I guess you don't
hear very well, sodbuster.

591
00:36:02,675 --> 00:36:05,610
I thought I told you if you wanted
to keep healthy,

592
00:36:05,678 --> 00:36:07,442
to stay out of here.

593
00:36:07,514 --> 00:36:09,141
Now, get going.

594
00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:16,154
Look, pig farmer.

595
00:36:16,223 --> 00:36:19,124
You better get back inside
with the women and kids

596
00:36:19,192 --> 00:36:20,751
where it's safe.

597
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,361
Don't push it, Calloway.

598
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:26,966
Did you hear me?

599
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:28,467
I said, get going.

600
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:35,643
Did you think you was
going to come in here

601
00:36:35,711 --> 00:36:37,645
and drink with the men?

602
00:36:37,713 --> 00:36:39,146
Set 'em up, bartender.

603
00:36:39,214 --> 00:36:40,306
Two whiskeys.

604
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,585
You bought me a drink
last time I was in.

605
00:36:44,653 --> 00:36:47,645
Now I want
to buy you one.

606
00:36:47,723 --> 00:36:50,784
You ain't gonna
drink that in here.

607
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:57,381
You guessed it.

608
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,329
Let me have him.

609
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:19,928
Let him go.

610
00:37:20,006 --> 00:37:21,940
Go get him, Chris.

611
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,981
Tear him apart.

612
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:33,509
Tear that sodbuster
in half.

613
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:35,521
Hang one on him,
Chris.

614
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:38,114
Bust that mug
of his.

615
00:37:38,192 --> 00:37:39,853
Let him have it.

616
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:41,360
This is bad.

617
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,123
This is bad.

618
00:37:43,197 --> 00:37:44,529
I'm going in there.

619
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:46,362
You're gonna
stay right here.

620
00:37:46,434 --> 00:37:47,867
This ain't our fight.

621
00:37:47,936 --> 00:37:50,131
We'll get run out
of this country.

622
00:37:50,205 --> 00:37:52,070
Go get him,
Chris.

623
00:37:57,613 --> 00:37:59,274
That's the trouble
around here...

624
00:37:59,348 --> 00:38:01,475
ain't a marshal
within 100 miles.

625
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,882
Get after him,
Chris.

626
00:38:05,554 --> 00:38:07,283
Plow him under,
Chris.

627
00:38:12,395 --> 00:38:14,829
Beat his brains out.

628
00:38:25,276 --> 00:38:26,243
Get him.

629
00:38:30,715 --> 00:38:32,342
Now land that right,
Chris.

630
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,646
Knock him
into that pigpen.

631
00:38:42,594 --> 00:38:44,323
Dirty pig farmer.

632
00:38:53,606 --> 00:38:54,538
Stop this, men.

633
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:55,699
Here, men!

634
00:38:55,775 --> 00:38:57,208
Here, stop this!

635
00:39:02,248 --> 00:39:04,148
Settle it outside.

636
00:39:40,122 --> 00:39:42,750
Well, it looks like
it's all over.

637
00:39:42,825 --> 00:39:45,521
I think ve should
get out of here.

638
00:39:45,594 --> 00:39:47,027
Let's all go now.

639
00:39:47,096 --> 00:39:48,154
Ja.

640
00:39:48,231 --> 00:39:50,665
Maybe you'd like
to draw str...

641
00:39:50,734 --> 00:39:52,167
Hold on, young fella.

642
00:39:52,235 --> 00:39:53,668
Cool off a bit.

643
00:39:53,737 --> 00:39:57,503
You may have a friend
you don't know you've got.

644
00:39:57,574 --> 00:39:59,405
I need a man like you.

645
00:39:59,476 --> 00:40:01,341
I'm working for Starett.

646
00:40:01,411 --> 00:40:04,540
You don't belong
on the end of a shovel.

647
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:07,106
Anything to keep you
from drawing your time?

648
00:40:07,185 --> 00:40:09,585
I like working
for Starett.

649
00:40:09,654 --> 00:40:11,884
Whatever he's paying,

650
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:13,389
I'll double.

651
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:14,891
It's no use.

652
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,428
What are you
looking for?

653
00:40:17,496 --> 00:40:19,691
Nothing.

654
00:40:25,137 --> 00:40:27,196
Pretty wife Starett's got.

655
00:40:27,272 --> 00:40:29,137
You dirty,
slinking old man!

656
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:31,200
Nobody talks
to me that way.

657
00:40:31,277 --> 00:40:32,642
I'm talking that way.

658
00:40:32,712 --> 00:40:34,145
You had your chance.

659
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:37,445
Nobody messes up
one of my boys.

660
00:40:37,517 --> 00:40:40,213
We're gonna ride you
out of this valley.

661
00:40:40,286 --> 00:40:43,312
We're gonna rough you up,
and you're gonna stay out.

662
00:40:47,495 --> 00:40:48,928
Shane, come on.

663
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:50,463
Joey, get out of here.

664
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:55,901
But, Shane,
there's too many.

665
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,668
You wouldn't want me
to run away, would you?

666
00:41:03,779 --> 00:41:05,804
But there's
too many, Shane.

667
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:12,552
Go on, son. Please.

668
00:41:20,663 --> 00:41:22,756
Here, men, stop this.

669
00:41:22,832 --> 00:41:24,094
I'll pay the damages.

670
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:25,499
No more fighting here.

671
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:26,661
You keep out of this.

672
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:27,726
This man's unarmed.

673
00:41:27,805 --> 00:41:29,932
It ain't a shooting.

674
00:41:30,007 --> 00:41:31,565
Quit butting in.

675
00:41:31,642 --> 00:41:33,507
I'll take him.

676
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:41,141
Stop it, men!

677
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:42,584
Stop fighting!

678
00:41:57,803 --> 00:41:59,065
Stop it, men!

679
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:02,933
Stop this!

680
00:42:16,456 --> 00:42:18,549
Break his neck.

681
00:42:20,495 --> 00:42:22,656
Where's Joey?

682
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,664
They're going
to kill Shane!

683
00:42:24,732 --> 00:42:27,565
They're all trying
to kill him in there.

684
00:42:27,635 --> 00:42:28,966
Stay with your mother.

685
00:42:29,036 --> 00:42:30,469
Joe, don't go in.

686
00:42:30,538 --> 00:42:32,563
What Ryker's got coming to him

687
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,302
ain't fit
for women to see.

688
00:42:34,376 --> 00:42:35,308
Bust him.

689
00:42:35,377 --> 00:42:37,743
You'll get us
in trouble.

690
00:42:37,813 --> 00:42:40,043
Kick his brains in.

691
00:43:42,081 --> 00:43:43,913
Stop it!

692
00:43:43,984 --> 00:43:46,248
Stop it, men! Stop it!

693
00:43:47,988 --> 00:43:49,080
Stop it!

694
00:43:49,156 --> 00:43:51,920
You fools,
you've had enough of it.

695
00:43:51,992 --> 00:43:53,425
You'll all
get killed.

696
00:43:53,493 --> 00:43:57,315
Starett, Shane,
back on out of here.

697
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:03,445
That's making
some sense, Starett.

698
00:44:03,521 --> 00:44:04,783
You've won.

699
00:44:07,826 --> 00:44:09,453
Get out of here.

700
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:12,622
Ryker ain't paying
for this damage.

701
00:44:12,698 --> 00:44:15,462
I'll pay you
for what's broke.

702
00:44:15,534 --> 00:44:17,900
No. We're paying
for what's broke,

703
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,403
Me and Shane.

704
00:44:28,482 --> 00:44:33,146
Morgan, put one of the boys
on a good horse.

705
00:44:34,488 --> 00:44:36,422
He's got a long trip,

706
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:38,424
All the way to Cheyenne.

707
00:44:39,994 --> 00:44:41,928
I'm through fooling, Grafton.

708
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:43,429
From now on,

709
00:44:43,498 --> 00:44:45,432
when we fight with them,

710
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,958
the air is gonna be filled
with gun smoke.

711
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,775
I saw it all, Mother,
every bit of it.

712
00:44:54,843 --> 00:44:57,073
It was no place for you, Joey.

713
00:44:57,146 --> 00:44:59,273
No place for you, either, Marian.

714
00:44:59,348 --> 00:45:00,781
I was scared.

715
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:02,282
Then Pa came in,

716
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:05,286
picked up that man,
and slung him on the floor.

717
00:45:05,354 --> 00:45:06,788
I didn't do much.

718
00:45:06,856 --> 00:45:08,289
It was all Shane.

719
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:09,791
How you feeling, Shane?

720
00:45:09,859 --> 00:45:11,121
Much better.

721
00:45:11,194 --> 00:45:12,627
You did, Joe.

722
00:45:12,695 --> 00:45:14,128
It was ugly,

723
00:45:14,197 --> 00:45:15,892
and you were
both wonderful.

724
00:45:15,965 --> 00:45:18,229
When that chair hit you, Shane,

725
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:20,736
I thought
you were a goner.

726
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:23,238
It was an easy chair, Joey.

727
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:30,845
I bet you two
could lick anyone.

728
00:45:30,915 --> 00:45:32,849
Well, one thing for sure...

729
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:34,351
Ryker's going to think twice.

730
00:45:34,419 --> 00:45:35,852
Don't talk about Ryker,

731
00:45:35,921 --> 00:45:37,411
not anymore tonight.

732
00:45:37,489 --> 00:45:39,923
I wish we could forget him.

733
00:45:45,497 --> 00:45:47,727
This turpentine's
going to hurt.

734
00:45:47,799 --> 00:45:49,233
He wouldn't say nothing,

735
00:45:49,302 --> 00:45:52,032
no matter
how much it hurt.

736
00:45:52,104 --> 00:45:54,436
Well, I'm afraid I would, Joey,

737
00:45:54,507 --> 00:45:56,839
if it hurt bad enough.

738
00:45:56,909 --> 00:45:58,934
Stings like anything.

739
00:45:59,011 --> 00:46:00,945
Joey, go on to bed.

740
00:46:04,117 --> 00:46:05,550
It does smart.

741
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:06,881
I know.

742
00:46:06,954 --> 00:46:08,046
Ouch!

743
00:46:08,121 --> 00:46:09,452
Gosh.

744
00:46:09,523 --> 00:46:12,287
Joey, for the last time,
go to bed.

745
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:14,452
Yeah, me, too.

746
00:46:14,528 --> 00:46:16,394
Come on, Son.

747
00:46:16,464 --> 00:46:17,897
Will you come in

748
00:46:17,966 --> 00:46:19,900
and kiss me good night, Mother?

749
00:46:19,968 --> 00:46:21,060
All right.

750
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:23,903
Your head...

751
00:46:23,972 --> 00:46:26,133
your head
needs a bandage.

752
00:46:26,207 --> 00:46:28,903
Oh, it's good enough,
Marian.

753
00:46:28,977 --> 00:46:30,275
It's fine.

754
00:46:30,346 --> 00:46:32,075
Thanks very much.

755
00:46:34,483 --> 00:46:36,576
You want to know something,
Mother?

756
00:46:36,652 --> 00:46:38,085
What is it?

757
00:46:44,261 --> 00:46:45,694
What is it, Joey?

758
00:46:45,762 --> 00:46:49,721
Mother, I just love Shane.

759
00:46:51,334 --> 00:46:52,426
Do you?

760
00:46:52,502 --> 00:46:56,438
I love him almost as much
as I love Pa.

761
00:46:56,506 --> 00:46:58,941
That's all right,
isn't it?

762
00:47:00,678 --> 00:47:02,612
He's a fine man.

763
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,444
He's so good.

764
00:47:06,851 --> 00:47:08,785
Don't you like him,
Mother?

765
00:47:10,521 --> 00:47:13,457
Yes, I like him,
too, Joey.

766
00:47:13,525 --> 00:47:15,288
Good night, Joey.

767
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:31,242
What's the matter,
honey?

768
00:47:33,413 --> 00:47:34,641
Joe...

769
00:47:36,983 --> 00:47:38,075
hold me.

770
00:47:40,988 --> 00:47:42,421
Don't say anything.

771
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:44,582
Just hold me... tight.

772
00:47:57,005 --> 00:47:58,939
Good night, Ma.

773
00:47:59,007 --> 00:48:00,804
Good night, Joey.

774
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:03,743
Good night, Pa.

775
00:48:03,812 --> 00:48:05,279
Good night, Son.

776
00:48:07,016 --> 00:48:08,950
Night, Shane!

777
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,239
Where's Ryker?

778
00:49:10,517 --> 00:49:12,712
He's getting
a little sleep.

779
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:15,220
He sent for me.

780
00:49:15,288 --> 00:49:17,883
Won't you sit down
for a minute?

781
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,892
We're having
a celebration today.

782
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:24,396
Where's the coffee?

783
00:49:24,465 --> 00:49:26,399
I'll put it right on.

784
00:49:34,976 --> 00:49:36,409
What's going on here?

785
00:49:36,478 --> 00:49:37,911
Plenty.

786
00:49:37,979 --> 00:49:39,913
Going somewhere?

787
00:49:39,981 --> 00:49:42,779
Well, it looks that way,
don't it?

788
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:44,547
Don't let them bluff you,
Ernie.

789
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,214
Bluff, huh?

790
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:49,019
See that?

791
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,222
They killed my sow
last night.

792
00:49:53,296 --> 00:49:54,422
Kept shooting

793
00:49:54,497 --> 00:49:56,932
and yelling what
they'd do next.

794
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,433
Woke up the kids

795
00:49:58,502 --> 00:50:00,902
and scared the missus
half to death.

796
00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:03,948
We're gonna put
a stop to that.

797
00:50:04,082 --> 00:50:06,880
I said I'd stay
for one more hand.

798
00:50:06,951 --> 00:50:08,384
Well, this is it.

799
00:50:08,453 --> 00:50:10,387
I had enough of Ryker.

800
00:50:10,455 --> 00:50:12,981
[Yelling]

801
00:50:14,393 --> 00:50:15,826
Here they come again!

802
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:39,285
Right through
my plowed ground.

803
00:50:41,822 --> 00:50:44,791
Well, what do you think of that,
Stonewall Torrey?

804
00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:47,293
Well, Starett and the rest of us

805
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:50,296
are gonna take the juice
out of them...

806
00:50:50,364 --> 00:50:51,797
one of these days.

807
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:56,795
I'm going into Grafton's
and get a bottle for the picnic.

808
00:50:56,872 --> 00:50:59,807
I'm going to show them
it's Independence Day.

809
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:01,467
Ma, you getting ready?

810
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:04,911
Good luck, anyway.

811
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,643
Hope good luck for you, too.

812
00:51:07,717 --> 00:51:09,150
[Laughter]

813
00:51:09,218 --> 00:51:12,153
I don't see
a pig in sight.

814
00:51:13,489 --> 00:51:14,922
I don't see none,

815
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:17,152
but I sure can
smell 'em.

816
00:51:17,226 --> 00:51:19,353
[Laughter]

817
00:51:25,402 --> 00:51:27,962
They cut
Mr. Wright's fence

818
00:51:28,038 --> 00:51:29,835
and Mr. Shipstead's,
too.

819
00:51:29,907 --> 00:51:31,602
They did?

820
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:34,338
Shane, what would you do

821
00:51:34,412 --> 00:51:37,609
if you caught them
cutting our fence?

822
00:51:37,682 --> 00:51:39,115
Well, I'd ask them

823
00:51:39,184 --> 00:51:42,153
to please go around
by the gate.

824
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:43,881
Aw, Shane.

825
00:51:45,924 --> 00:51:48,155
I'll race you

got himself hooked,

What do you say, Joe?

1001
01:02:02,774 --> 01:02:08,007
I gave up my independence
10 years ago today.

1002
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:12,073
But, uh, no man ever gave
it up as easy as I did.

And... and what's more,

we can talk over
right here.

1105

I'll just lay it
on the barrel head.

1106
01:07:29,306 --> 01:07:32,241
How would you like
to work for me?

1107

I'm working
for myself.

for others.

I haven't said it all.

1114

1116
01:07:53,765 --> 01:07:55,859
I'll buy your homestead.

1117
01:07:55,934 --> 01:07:58,869
Set a price you
think is reasonable,

1118
01:07:58,937 --> 01:08:00,370
and you'll find
me reasonable.

1119
01:08:00,439 --> 01:08:01,565
Is that fair?

1120
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:05,235
You've made things
pretty hard for us, Ryker,

1121
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:07,301
and us in the right.

1122
01:08:07,379 --> 01:08:10,679
Right?
You in the right?

1123
01:08:13,887 --> 01:08:16,185
Look, Starett,

1124
01:08:16,256 --> 01:08:20,352
when I come to this country,
you weren't older than your boy.

1125
01:08:20,427 --> 01:08:23,260
We had rough times.

1126
01:08:23,329 --> 01:08:26,766
Me and other men
that are mostly dead now.

1127
01:08:26,834 --> 01:08:31,203
I got a bad shoulder yet
from a Cheyenne arrowhead.

1128
01:08:31,272 --> 01:08:33,706
We made this country.

1129
01:08:33,774 --> 01:08:36,800
We found it,
and we made it.

1130
01:08:36,877 --> 01:08:39,904
Work, blood,
and empty bellies...

1131
01:08:39,981 --> 01:08:44,714
Cattle we brought in were hazed off
by Indians and rustlers.

1132
01:08:44,786 --> 01:08:48,119
They don't bother you much anymore
because we handled them.

1133
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:52,218
We made a safe range
out of this.

1134
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:56,231
Some of us died doing it,
but we made it.

1135
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,233
And then people move in

1136
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:01,532
who never had to rawhide
it through the old days.

1137
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:04,596
They fence off my range

1138
01:09:04,674 --> 01:09:06,768
and fence me off
from water.

1139
01:09:09,513 --> 01:09:11,447
Some of them like you
plow ditches

1140
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:13,449
and take out
irrigation water,

1141
01:09:13,517 --> 01:09:16,384
and so the creek
runs dry sometimes,

1142
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:20,754
and I've got to move
my stock because of it.

1143
01:09:20,825 --> 01:09:24,761
And you say we have
no right to the range.

1144
01:09:24,829 --> 01:09:28,925
The men that did the work
and ran the risks have no rights?

1145
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,064
I take you for a fair man,
Starett.

1146
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:37,234
I'm not belittling what
you and the others did.

1147
01:09:37,309 --> 01:09:39,743
But you didn't find
this country.

1148
01:09:39,812 --> 01:09:43,748
There was trappers here
and Indian traders long before you.

1149
01:09:43,816 --> 01:09:46,547
They tamed this country
more than you.

1150
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,485
They weren't ranchers!

1151
01:09:48,555 --> 01:09:49,715
You talk about rights.

1152
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:51,587
You think you've
got the right

1153
01:09:51,658 --> 01:09:53,751
to say nobody
else has any.

1154
01:09:53,827 --> 01:09:56,728
That ain't the way
the government looks at it.

1155
01:09:56,797 --> 01:09:59,595
I didn't come to argue.

1156
01:09:59,666 --> 01:10:02,101
I made you
a fair proposition.

1157
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:05,264
What about the others?

1158
01:10:05,339 --> 01:10:08,604
Shane already knows
he can work for me.

1159
01:10:08,676 --> 01:10:10,109
The other homesteaders.

1160
01:10:10,178 --> 01:10:11,611
Look, be reasonable.

1161
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:15,548
After all, there's just so many hands
in a deck of cards.

1162
01:10:19,388 --> 01:10:21,515
Then I've got to say no.

1163
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:25,822
You don't give a man much choice,
do you, Starett?

1164
01:10:32,435 --> 01:10:35,336
How do you feel about it, son?

1165
01:10:35,405 --> 01:10:37,999
Wouldn't you like
to go partners with me?

1166
01:10:38,074 --> 01:10:41,339
I don't want trouble
with your father.

1167
01:10:41,411 --> 01:10:44,347
We don't want anyone
to get hurt.

1168
01:10:44,415 --> 01:10:46,508
Joey ain't quite of age.

1169
01:10:46,584 --> 01:10:49,109
How about it, son?

1170
01:10:49,186 --> 01:10:50,619
[Marian]
Come here, Joey.

1171
01:11:00,031 --> 01:11:02,966
I don't want you
to be sorry, Starett.

1172
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:07,604
I'll see ya.

1173
01:11:25,292 --> 01:11:27,692
What do you make of him?

1174
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:31,253
He's no cowpuncher.

1175
01:11:31,331 --> 01:11:35,028
No... he doesn't look the part,
sure enough.

1176
01:12:05,568 --> 01:12:07,001
I like Starett, too,

1177
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:10,562
but I'll kill him
if I have to.

1178
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,007
I tell you,
I'll kill him if I have to.

1179
01:12:14,077 --> 01:12:17,171
You mean I'll kill him
if you have to.

1180
01:12:17,247 --> 01:12:20,684
I can't have any
run-in with the law.

1181
01:12:20,751 --> 01:12:22,184
You heard Grafton.

1182
01:12:22,253 --> 01:12:24,687
You just get
Starett in here.

1183
01:12:24,755 --> 01:12:28,555
It wouldn't take
much to bait him.

1184
01:12:32,464 --> 01:12:35,943
Well, lookee here.

1185
01:12:42,216 --> 01:12:44,116
Lookee here.

1186
01:13:02,405 --> 01:13:07,342
Why don't we just gun him
and get on with it?

1187
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:08,843
One's run already.

1188
01:13:08,911 --> 01:13:11,846
It won't take much to stampede
the rest.

1189
01:13:15,452 --> 01:13:18,012
Remember, Wilson,

1190
01:13:18,088 --> 01:13:22,024
we've got to make this
look right to Grafton.

1191
01:13:33,104 --> 01:13:35,197
[Thunder]

1192
01:14:08,975 --> 01:14:10,944
[Thunder]

1193
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,588
Hey! Come here.

1194
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,731
Torrey... I vouldn't go over there,
Torrey.

1195
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:37,739
Nobody's going to buffalo me.

1196
01:14:52,856 --> 01:14:54,983
What can I do for you?

1197
01:14:55,059 --> 01:14:58,324
Where do you think
you're going?

1198
01:14:58,395 --> 01:15:00,329
Well, to get a whiskey.

1199
01:15:00,397 --> 01:15:01,921
Torrey.

1200
01:15:07,839 --> 01:15:09,238
Torrey.

1201
01:15:10,909 --> 01:15:14,037
[Thunder]

1202
01:15:21,253 --> 01:15:22,311
Torrey?

1203
01:15:43,543 --> 01:15:47,674
[Thunder]

1204
01:15:52,053 --> 01:15:56,114
They tell me they call you
Stonewall.

1205
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:59,023
Anything wrong with that?

1206
01:15:59,093 --> 01:16:00,925
That's just funny.

1207
01:16:04,299 --> 01:16:07,791
I guess they named
a lot of that...

1208
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:12,569
southern trash
after old Stonewall.

1209
01:16:14,744 --> 01:16:16,905
Who'd they name you after...

1210
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:18,811
or would you know?

1211
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:26,780
I'm saying that Stonewall Jackson
was trash himself.

1212
01:16:26,856 --> 01:16:31,794
Him and Lee and all the rest
of them rebs.

1213
01:16:34,231 --> 01:16:36,791
You, too.

1214
01:16:36,867 --> 01:16:39,631
You're a low-down lying Yankee.

1215
01:16:41,406 --> 01:16:42,464
Prove it.

1216
01:16:44,409 --> 01:16:46,536
No, Torrey!

1217
01:17:10,471 --> 01:17:12,496
[Brown]
One less sodbuster.

1218
01:17:14,942 --> 01:17:15,806
What?

1219
01:17:15,876 --> 01:17:17,366
He tried to pull
on Wilson.

1220
01:17:17,444 --> 01:17:19,241
Ain't that right,
Swede?

1221
01:17:19,313 --> 01:17:20,302
Vell, he...

1222
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:22,439
he tried to reach for a...

1223
01:17:22,516 --> 01:17:24,849
[Morgan]
All right...

1224
01:17:24,919 --> 01:17:26,853
get him out of here.

1225
01:17:26,921 --> 01:17:30,357
Then you can go back
and tell your friends

1226
01:17:30,425 --> 01:17:34,361
we'll be waiting right here
for any more of them

1227
01:17:34,429 --> 01:17:36,329
that comes in looking
for trouble.

1228
01:17:36,397 --> 01:17:40,266
You understand that,
Swede?

1229
01:17:40,336 --> 01:17:42,896
Now, get him out of here.

1230
01:17:42,972 --> 01:17:43,904
What happened?

1231
01:17:43,973 --> 01:17:46,771
A sodbuster
tried to kill Wilson.

1232
01:17:46,842 --> 01:17:48,537
What's the shooting?

1233
01:17:48,611 --> 01:17:53,413
A sodbuster
tried to pull on Wilson.

1234
01:17:53,483 --> 01:17:55,815
[Morgan]
Ha ha ha.

1235
01:18:00,557 --> 01:18:02,218
Lewis!

1236
01:18:03,927 --> 01:18:05,862
Lewis!

1237
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:07,955
Pa...

1238
01:18:08,032 --> 01:18:10,592
what's happened?

1239
01:18:10,668 --> 01:18:13,068
Lewis!

1240
01:18:13,137 --> 01:18:15,401
Fred!

1241
01:18:15,473 --> 01:18:16,838
Fred!

1242
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:35,527
Lewis, he is dead.

1243
01:18:35,595 --> 01:18:37,620
Ryker did it.

1244
01:18:41,034 --> 01:18:43,161
I go for Starett.

1245
01:18:47,608 --> 01:18:50,543
Shane, we've sure enough
earned our keep today.

1246
01:18:50,611 --> 01:18:53,045
If they just
leave us alone,

1247
01:18:53,113 --> 01:18:57,550
we're going to make a farm
out of this place yet.

1248
01:18:57,618 --> 01:18:59,313
Somebody's coming, Pa.

1249
01:19:02,958 --> 01:19:04,391
It looks like Shipstead.

1250
01:19:04,459 --> 01:19:07,087
It's Mr. Shipstead.

1251
01:19:07,162 --> 01:19:08,424
Starett!

1252
01:19:09,865 --> 01:19:13,426
Torrey... he is dead!

1253
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:15,798
Torrey.

1254
01:19:17,773 --> 01:19:20,503
Torrey, he is dead!

1255
01:19:21,944 --> 01:19:23,172
Torrey's dead.

1256
01:19:23,246 --> 01:19:25,180
The new man shot him.

1257
01:19:25,248 --> 01:19:28,685
The new man that works for Ryker
did it.

1258
01:19:30,554 --> 01:19:34,991
I vas across the street
and hear anger in the voices.

1259
01:19:35,058 --> 01:19:38,494
And they reach
for their pistols,

1260
01:19:38,562 --> 01:19:44,001
but the new man is quick,
terribly quick.

1261
01:19:44,068 --> 01:19:47,970
One shot, Torrey's dead,

1262
01:19:48,039 --> 01:19:49,199
One shot.

1263
01:19:49,274 --> 01:19:50,206
What happened?

1264
01:19:50,275 --> 01:19:54,803
Vell, ve go to town together.

1265
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:57,280
He say it be safe.

1266
01:19:57,349 --> 01:19:58,714
Vas all quiet.

1267
01:19:58,784 --> 01:20:00,251
Ve separate.

1268
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:03,254
Then the anger
in the voices I hear,

1269
01:20:03,322 --> 01:20:05,847
only the anger,
not the words.

1270
01:20:05,925 --> 01:20:09,555
Ryker's men
vas all around.

1271
01:20:09,629 --> 01:20:11,062
What started it?

1272
01:20:11,131 --> 01:20:14,567
I pass Lewis, him and his missus,
and Yohnson.

1273
01:20:14,634 --> 01:20:16,363
They scared.

1274
01:20:16,436 --> 01:20:17,869
Who saw it?

1275
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:20,372
Just the Ryker men and me.

1276
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,635
Morgan say
they vait in town

1277
01:20:22,709 --> 01:20:26,173
for any more that vant to come around
looking for trouble.

1278
01:20:26,307 --> 01:20:27,604
Marian...

1279
01:20:27,675 --> 01:20:29,108
honey, you get ready.

1280
01:20:29,176 --> 01:20:31,235
Mrs. Torrey
will need you.

1281
01:20:31,312 --> 01:20:33,678
Shane, hitch up the team.

1282
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:37,782
What are you
going to do?

1283
01:20:37,852 --> 01:20:40,844
Go to town.
I'm going to see about this.

1284
01:20:40,922 --> 01:20:42,355
You can't go alone.

1285
01:20:42,424 --> 01:20:43,857
Marian, I'm going.

1286
01:20:43,925 --> 01:20:46,223
She's right, Joe.

1287
01:20:46,294 --> 01:20:49,229
But the others
are all in this.

1288
01:20:49,297 --> 01:20:51,232
It's not just you, Joe.

1289
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,733
Wait. Wait for them.

1290
01:20:52,802 --> 01:20:55,362
Sooner or later,
someone's got to go.

1291
01:20:55,438 --> 01:20:56,871
[Marian]
But not now.

1292
01:20:56,939 --> 01:21:00,306
Don't you go alone.

1293
01:21:00,376 --> 01:21:03,311
The other homesteaders,
I think they run.

1294
01:21:03,379 --> 01:21:06,315
I think they
get out of here.

1295
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:10,152
Here comes Joe Starett.

1296
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:13,678
Wish he'd tend to his own business.

1297
01:21:17,294 --> 01:21:18,887
What goes on, Fred?

1298
01:21:18,963 --> 01:21:20,897
Just us.
We're going on.

1299
01:21:20,965 --> 01:21:22,398
I've had enough.

1300
01:21:22,467 --> 01:21:25,402
I sure figured you
for a better man.

1301
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:28,405
You've already saw what happened,
haven't you?

1302
01:21:28,473 --> 01:21:29,906
Torrey's dead, ain't he?

1303
01:21:29,974 --> 01:21:32,910
Just going to pile up your plunder
and skip.

1304
01:21:32,978 --> 01:21:36,641
Too scared to even see Torrey
get a decent funeral.

1305
01:21:36,715 --> 01:21:38,546
I don't want him killed.

1306
01:21:38,617 --> 01:21:39,811
We're going.

1307
01:21:39,885 --> 01:21:44,288
Martha, it ain't a question
of who stays or who runs.

1308
01:21:44,356 --> 01:21:48,691
The thing is, we've got to see Stonewall
get a Christian burial.

1309
01:21:48,762 --> 01:21:52,528

01:32:06,298 --> 01:32:08,233
Tell him he can't go.

1471
01:32:08,301 --> 01:32:10,132
It won't work.
Tell him.

1472
01:32:10,203 --> 01:32:11,295
Shane!

1473
01:32:12,805 --> 01:32:13,897
Wait, Joe.

1474
01:32:13,973 --> 01:32:15,838
Wait till things
cool off.

1475
01:32:15,908 --> 01:32:17,205
Wait that long anyway.

1476
01:32:17,276 --> 01:32:19,676
That's right,
isn't it, Shane?

1477
01:32:21,581 --> 01:32:24,517
I can't tell Joe
what's right, Marian.

1478
01:32:57,453 --> 01:32:59,216
Please wait, Joe.

1479
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:03,053
Won't you do...

1480
01:33:03,125 --> 01:33:05,390
even this for me?

1481
01:33:12,636 --> 01:33:14,069
[Dog Barks]

1482
01:33:15,071 --> 01:33:16,971
[Barking]

1483
01:33:29,086 --> 01:33:30,417
Starett!

1484
01:33:32,591 --> 01:33:34,525
Mr. Starett!

1485
01:33:58,618 --> 01:34:00,246
Who is it?

1486
01:34:00,321 --> 01:34:02,721
Peace party from Ryker.

1487
01:34:05,626 --> 01:34:08,493
One of you can
come across and talk.

1488
01:34:20,575 --> 01:34:22,475
Stay out of
that garden.

1489
01:34:22,544 --> 01:34:24,011
We ain't armed.

1490
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:34,184
Brother Rufe
wants to see you.

1491
01:34:37,259 --> 01:34:40,855
He says to tell you
he's a reasonable man.

1492
01:34:40,931 --> 01:34:44,025
Your brother's responsible for killing
my friend Torrey.

1493
01:34:44,101 --> 01:34:46,035
My brother wouldn't
kill anybody.

1494
01:34:46,103 --> 01:34:48,697
He don't want
to go to jail.

1495
01:34:48,772 --> 01:34:50,205
Torrey was a hothead.

1496
01:34:50,273 --> 01:34:52,173
He picked on a stranger.

1497
01:34:52,242 --> 01:34:54,711
Torrey didn't want
to be reasonable.

1498
01:34:54,779 --> 01:34:58,180
You want to be reasonable,
don't you, Starett?

1499
01:34:58,249 --> 01:35:00,945
I always figured
on being reasonable.

1500
01:35:01,018 --> 01:35:02,451
My brother's waiting.

1501
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,488
He'll see you
at Grafton's.

1502
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:06,952
Who else?

1503
01:35:08,627 --> 01:35:10,390
Not us.

1504
01:35:10,462 --> 01:35:12,054
We're heading home.

1505
01:35:15,567 --> 01:35:17,330
I'll see your brother.

1506
01:36:04,053 --> 01:36:05,213
Shane.

1507
01:36:12,795 --> 01:36:14,194
Shane.

1508
01:36:15,398 --> 01:36:17,162
Who is it?

1509
01:36:17,234 --> 01:36:18,326
Calloway.

1510
01:36:18,402 --> 01:36:19,664
Chris Calloway.

1511
01:36:19,736 --> 01:36:21,670
Stay there.
I can drill you.

1512
01:36:21,738 --> 01:36:23,171
Hold it, Shane.

1513
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:24,832
Something to tell you.

1514
01:36:28,245 --> 01:36:29,678
What do you want?

1515
01:36:29,746 --> 01:36:33,183
Starett's up against
a stacked deck.

1516
01:36:33,251 --> 01:36:35,242
Bang, bang.

1517
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:36,582
Bang, bang, bang.

1518
01:36:36,654 --> 01:36:38,849
Bang, bang, bang.

1519
01:36:38,923 --> 01:36:40,515
Why you telling me?

1520
01:36:40,592 --> 01:36:42,025
I don't know.

1521
01:36:42,093 --> 01:36:44,527
I reckon something's
come over me.

1522
01:36:44,596 --> 01:36:46,360
I don't figure you.

1523
01:36:46,432 --> 01:36:48,957
I'm quitting Ryker.

1524
01:36:49,034 --> 01:36:50,831
Bang, bang.

1525
01:36:50,903 --> 01:36:51,870
So long.

1526
01:36:51,937 --> 01:36:53,029
Chris...

1527
01:36:55,407 --> 01:36:56,533
Thanks.

1528
01:36:58,945 --> 01:37:00,708
Be seeing you.

1529
01:37:02,782 --> 01:37:04,340
Bang, bang, bang.

1530
01:37:12,793 --> 01:37:14,727
No use to argue, Marian.

1531
01:37:14,795 --> 01:37:17,662
I'm going into this
with my eyes open.

1532
01:37:18,733 --> 01:37:20,928
No!

1533
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:24,563
Isn't there anything
I can say that will change things?

1534
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:27,575
Can't you see maybe
this is a chance?

1535
01:37:27,643 --> 01:37:29,702
Morgan and them boys
went home.

1536
01:37:29,778 --> 01:37:31,746
You don't really
believe that.

1537
01:37:31,813 --> 01:37:34,077
That's not the reason.

1538
01:37:34,149 --> 01:37:36,743
It's just too much
to give up...

1539
01:37:36,818 --> 01:37:39,252
This place and our valley...

1540
01:37:39,321 --> 01:37:41,552
all the things
that will be.

1541
01:37:41,624 --> 01:37:43,091
Will be...

1542
01:37:43,159 --> 01:37:44,251
Bang!

1543
01:37:44,327 --> 01:37:47,228
Bang, bang, bang,
bang, bang!

1544
01:37:47,297 --> 01:37:48,696
Bang, bang, bang!

1545
01:37:48,765 --> 01:37:50,630
Don't point that thing.

1546
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:52,065
Go play outside!

1547
01:37:52,135 --> 01:37:53,067
Bang, bang!

1548
01:37:53,136 --> 01:37:54,570
Play outside, Joey!

1549
01:37:54,638 --> 01:37:56,196
Bang, bang...

1550
01:37:59,843 --> 01:38:00,935
Please, dear...

1551
01:38:01,011 --> 01:38:02,876
go outside and play.

1552
01:38:06,684 --> 01:38:08,619
It's just pride, that's all.

1553
01:38:09,921 --> 01:38:11,718
A silly kind of a pride.

1554
01:38:11,789 --> 01:38:15,156
Don't I mean anything
to you, Joe?

1555
01:38:15,226 --> 01:38:17,421
Doesn't Joey?

1556
01:38:19,063 --> 01:38:20,155
Marian...

1557
01:38:24,269 --> 01:38:26,066
honey...

1558
01:38:26,138 --> 01:38:30,666
it's because you mean so much to me
that I've got to go.

1559
01:38:30,742 --> 01:38:33,836
Do you think I could
go on living with you,

1560
01:38:33,912 --> 01:38:37,679
and you thinking
that I'd showed yellow?

1561
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:39,183
Then what about Joey?

1562
01:38:39,252 --> 01:38:41,846
How would I ever
explain that to him?

1563
01:38:41,921 --> 01:38:43,513
Oh, Joe...

1564
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:44,955
Joe...

1565
01:38:48,094 --> 01:38:50,359
I-I've been
thinking a lot,

1566
01:38:50,431 --> 01:38:51,898
and...

1567
01:38:51,966 --> 01:38:55,197
I know I'm kind of
slow sometimes, Marian,

1568
01:38:55,269 --> 01:38:57,703
but I see things...

1569
01:38:57,771 --> 01:39:00,706
and I know if anything
happened to me,

1570
01:39:00,774 --> 01:39:02,901
you'd be took care of.

1571
01:39:04,613 --> 01:39:09,209
You'd be took care of
better than I could do it myself.

1572
01:39:10,785 --> 01:39:14,721
I never thought I'd live
to hear myself say that,

1573
01:39:14,789 --> 01:39:19,989
but I guess now's a pretty good time
to lay things bare.

1574
01:39:20,062 --> 01:39:24,396
You talk as though
I'd be glad for you to go.

1575
01:39:24,467 --> 01:39:26,662
Honey, you're the most honest

1576
01:39:26,736 --> 01:39:29,330
and the finest girl
that ever lived,

1577
01:39:29,405 --> 01:39:32,170
and I couldn't do
what I got to do

1578
01:39:32,242 --> 01:39:36,008
if I hadn't always knowed
that I could trust you.

1579
01:39:45,623 --> 01:39:48,854
Now, don't you go
counting me out.

1580
01:39:48,926 --> 01:39:52,862
I wouldn't have lived
as long as I have already

1581
01:39:52,930 --> 01:39:54,921
if I wasn't pretty tough.

1582
01:40:17,824 --> 01:40:20,987
Pa! Shane's got his gun on.
He's coming!

1583
01:40:22,128 --> 01:40:23,060
Gun?

1584
01:40:24,998 --> 01:40:26,330
What's the idea?

1585
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,163
Don't let him go, Shane.

1586
01:40:28,235 --> 01:40:30,169
Don't anybody go.

1587
01:40:30,237 --> 01:40:32,671
This is my kind of game, Joe.

1588
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:34,503
Except it ain't yours.

1589
01:40:34,575 --> 01:40:36,668
Maybe you're a match
for Ryker...

1590
01:40:36,744 --> 01:40:37,836
maybe not.

1591
01:40:37,912 --> 01:40:39,937
But you're no match
for Wilson.

1592
01:40:40,015 --> 01:40:42,176
Well, then I'll outlast him.

1593
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:44,309
But I do appreciate it, Shane.

1594
01:40:44,386 --> 01:40:46,411
You're both out of your senses.

1595
01:40:46,488 --> 01:40:48,422
This isn't worth
anybody's life.

1596
01:40:48,490 --> 01:40:50,185
What are you
fighting for,

1597
01:40:50,258 --> 01:40:51,691
this little
piece of ground

1598
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,318
and nothing but work,
work, work?

1599
01:40:53,395 --> 01:40:56,194
I'm sick of it.
I'm sick of trouble.

1600
01:40:56,265 --> 01:40:58,699
Joe, let's move.
Let's go on. Please?

1601
01:40:58,768 --> 01:41:00,201
Marian, don't say that.

1602
01:41:00,269 --> 01:41:01,702
That ain't the truth.

1603
01:41:01,771 --> 01:41:03,204
You love this place.

1604
01:41:03,272 --> 01:41:04,204
Not anymore.

1605
01:41:04,273 --> 01:41:05,865
Even if that was true,

1606
01:41:05,942 --> 01:41:07,000
it wouldn't change things.

1607
01:41:07,076 --> 01:41:09,102
There must be some way, Shane.

1608
01:41:09,179 --> 01:41:10,373
Some way?

1609
01:41:12,983 --> 01:41:13,915
It's no use, Joe.

1610
01:41:13,984 --> 01:41:16,509
No use?
Well, what's stopping me?

1611
01:41:16,587 --> 01:41:17,576
I am.

1612
01:41:17,654 --> 01:41:20,316
You get out of my way.

1613
01:41:20,390 --> 01:41:23,519
Am I going to have
to fight you, too?

1614
01:41:23,595 --> 01:41:25,153
That depends on you.

1615
01:41:26,498 --> 01:41:27,988
Aah!

1616
01:41:30,268 --> 01:41:31,701
No!

1617
01:41:33,271 --> 01:41:35,331
[Whinny]

1618
01:41:59,132 --> 01:42:00,565
Stop!

1619
01:43:43,611 --> 01:43:44,578
Oh...

1620
01:43:47,815 --> 01:43:48,747
Hyah.

1621
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:55,217
Shane! You hit him with your gun.

1622
01:43:55,291 --> 01:43:57,054
I hate you!

1623
01:44:04,633 --> 01:44:06,726
Have him walk around
when he comes to.

1624
01:44:06,802 --> 01:44:09,567
Joey, bring some
water and a towel.

1625
01:44:11,308 --> 01:44:13,003
Here, Marian.
Hide this.

1626
01:44:15,912 --> 01:44:17,402
He'll be all right.

1627
01:44:18,648 --> 01:44:22,346
No one can blame him
for not keeping that date.

1628
01:44:23,921 --> 01:44:25,684
Shane...

1629
01:44:25,756 --> 01:44:27,189
wait.

1630
01:44:30,428 --> 01:44:33,363
You were through
with gunfighting.

1631
01:44:33,431 --> 01:44:34,989
I changed my mind.

1632
01:44:36,935 --> 01:44:40,029
Are you doing this
just for me?

1633
01:44:40,105 --> 01:44:43,370
For you, Marian...

1634
01:44:43,442 --> 01:44:45,740
for Joe and little Joe.

1635
01:44:49,115 --> 01:44:51,743
Then we'll never
see you again?

1636
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:56,555
Never's a long time,
Marian.

1637
01:44:56,622 --> 01:44:59,056
Tell him...

1638
01:44:59,125 --> 01:45:01,150
tell him I was sorry.

1639
01:45:01,227 --> 01:45:03,753
No need to tell him that.

1640
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:07,697
Please, Shane...

1641
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:11,669
Mother...

1642
01:45:17,345 --> 01:45:18,676
Please...

1643
01:45:23,585 --> 01:45:26,213
Take care of yourself.

1644
01:45:40,436 --> 01:45:41,698
Mother...

1645
01:45:41,771 --> 01:45:44,205
Pa's coming along
all right.

1646
01:45:47,611 --> 01:45:49,374
Yes, Joey.

1647
01:45:49,446 --> 01:45:50,538
Why did Shane...

1648
01:45:50,614 --> 01:45:52,844
Shane did what he had to do,
Joey.

1649
01:45:52,916 --> 01:45:55,214
You don't hate Shane.

1650
01:45:56,453 --> 01:45:58,422
I know, Mother.

1651
01:46:01,626 --> 01:46:02,718
Shane.

1652
01:46:04,796 --> 01:46:06,559
I'm sorry.

1653
01:46:08,132 --> 01:46:10,032
He didn't hear you.

1654
01:46:19,411 --> 01:46:21,072
Shane!

1655
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:28,414
Shane, I'm sorry!

1656
01:50:46,623 --> 01:50:49,388
I came to get
your offer, Ryker.

1657
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:51,052
I'm not dealing
with you.

1658
01:50:51,128 --> 01:50:52,720
Where's Starett?

1659
01:50:54,164 --> 01:50:56,223
You're dealing
with me, Ryker.

1660
01:50:56,300 --> 01:50:59,064
I got no quarrel
with you, Shane.

1661
01:50:59,136 --> 01:51:00,728
You can walk out now

1662
01:51:00,804 --> 01:51:02,568
and no hard feelings.

1663
01:51:02,641 --> 01:51:04,336
What's your offer, Ryker?

1664
01:51:04,409 --> 01:51:06,036
To you...

1665
01:51:06,111 --> 01:51:07,578
not a thing.

1666
01:51:07,646 --> 01:51:09,409
That's too bad.

1667
01:51:09,481 --> 01:51:11,676
Too bad?

1668
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:14,082
Yeah. You've lived too long.

1669
01:51:14,152 --> 01:51:16,587
Your kind of days are over.

1670
01:51:16,656 --> 01:51:17,588
My days?

1671
01:51:17,657 --> 01:51:19,921
What about yours,
gunfighter?

1672
01:51:19,992 --> 01:51:22,085
The difference is,
I know it.

1673
01:51:22,161 --> 01:51:23,253
All right.

1674
01:51:23,329 --> 01:51:26,264
So we'll all
turn in our guns,

1675
01:51:26,332 --> 01:51:30,099
and we'll all start hoeing spuds.
Is that it?

1676
01:51:30,170 --> 01:51:31,762
Not quite yet.

1677
01:51:34,007 --> 01:51:36,942
We haven't heard
from your friend here.

1678
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:48,956
I wouldn't push too far
if I were you.

1679
01:52:10,579 --> 01:52:13,105
Our fight
ain't with you.

1680
01:52:15,986 --> 01:52:18,250
It ain't with me,
Wilson?

1681
01:52:18,321 --> 01:52:20,789
No, it ain't, Shane.

1682
01:52:20,857 --> 01:52:24,088
I wouldn't pull on Wilson,
Shane.

1683
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:26,595
Will, you're witness to this.

1684
01:52:28,833 --> 01:52:31,324
So you're Jack Wilson.

1685
01:52:31,402 --> 01:52:34,565
What's that mean to you, Shane?

1686
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:37,107
I've heard about you.

1687
01:52:40,345 --> 01:52:42,506
What have you heard, Shane?

1688
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:56,594
I've heard that you're
a low-down Yankee liar.

1689
01:53:05,071 --> 01:53:06,003
Prove it.

1690
01:53:37,707 --> 01:53:39,106
Shane, look out!

1691
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:16,713
Shane.

1692
01:54:18,851 --> 01:54:20,580
I knew you could, Shane.

1693
01:54:20,652 --> 01:54:21,914
I knew it.

1694
01:54:21,987 --> 01:54:24,581
I knew it just as well
as anything.

1695
01:54:24,656 --> 01:54:26,089
Was that him?

1696
01:54:26,158 --> 01:54:27,591
Was that Wilson?

1697
01:54:27,659 --> 01:54:29,593
That was him.

1698
01:54:29,661 --> 01:54:32,597
That was Wilson,
all right.

1699
01:54:32,665 --> 01:54:34,792
He was fast,

1700
01:54:34,868 --> 01:54:37,462
fast on the draw.

1701
01:54:37,537 --> 01:54:39,801
Joey, what are you doing here?

1702
01:54:42,675 --> 01:54:45,042
I'm sorry, Shane.

1703
01:54:45,112 --> 01:54:47,603
You don't have to be.

1704
01:54:47,681 --> 01:54:49,979
You better run back.

1705
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:52,450
Can't I ride home behind you?

1706
01:54:54,688 --> 01:54:56,952
Afraid not, Joey.

1707
01:54:57,024 --> 01:54:59,186
Please? Why not?

1708
01:55:00,862 --> 01:55:03,456
I got to be going on.

1709
01:55:06,301 --> 01:55:08,132
Why, Shane?

1710
01:55:09,704 --> 01:55:12,902
A man has to be
what he is, Joey.

1711
01:55:12,975 --> 01:55:14,909
Can't break the mold.

1712
01:55:16,145 --> 01:55:19,137
I tried it,
and it didn't work for me.

1713
01:55:19,215 --> 01:55:22,207
We want you, Shane.

1714
01:55:23,653 --> 01:55:25,588
Joey, there's no living with...

1715
01:55:25,656 --> 01:55:27,248
with a killing.

1716
01:55:27,324 --> 01:55:30,191
There's no going back from one.

1717
01:55:30,260 --> 01:55:32,592
Right or wrong,
it's a brand...

1718
01:55:32,663 --> 01:55:34,187
and a brand sticks.

1719
01:55:35,999 --> 01:55:38,866
There's no going back.

1720
01:55:38,936 --> 01:55:41,599
Now, you run on home
to your mother

1721
01:55:41,673 --> 01:55:45,268
and tell her
everything's all right,

1722
01:55:45,343 --> 01:55:48,608
and there aren't any more guns
in the valley.

1723
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:49,772
Shane...

1724
01:55:51,749 --> 01:55:53,274
it's bloody.

1725
01:55:53,352 --> 01:55:55,047
You're hurt.

1726
01:55:57,857 --> 01:56:00,621
I'm all right, Joey.

1727
01:56:00,693 --> 01:56:03,457
You go home to your
mother and your father

1728
01:56:03,529 --> 01:56:06,988
and grow up to be
strong and straight.

1729
01:56:10,370 --> 01:56:12,395
And, Joey...

1730
01:56:12,472 --> 01:56:15,566
take care of them.

1731
01:56:15,642 --> 01:56:17,439
Both of them.

1732
01:56:21,983 --> 01:56:23,575
Yes, Shane.

1733
01:56:35,163 --> 01:56:39,065
He'd never been able to shoot you
if you'd seen him.

1734
01:56:39,134 --> 01:56:40,863
Bye, little Joe.

1735
01:56:45,173 --> 01:56:49,110
He'd never even have cleared
the holster, would he, Shane?

1736
01:56:58,688 --> 01:57:01,851
Pa's got things
for you to do!

1737
01:57:01,925 --> 01:57:04,019
And mother wants you!

1738
01:57:06,196 --> 01:57:08,130
I know she does!

1739
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:11,133
Shane!

1740
01:57:19,477 --> 01:57:20,910
Shane!

1741
01:57:22,814 --> 01:57:25,078
Come back!
