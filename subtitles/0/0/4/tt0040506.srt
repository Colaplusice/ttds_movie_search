1
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:05,917
-Hello, Eddie.
-Hello, Ben.

2
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:06,965
What gives?

3
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:09,882
We're looking for a couple
of lndians broke out of jail.

4
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:12,248
Young bucks in fancy shirts.

5
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:15,646
If you see anything of them,
phone my office at Palm Grove.

6
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:26,484
Those lndians must be from around here.
They always head for home.

7
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:28,999
Home being Key Largo.

8
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:11,728
Want something, Jack?

9
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:13,368
Mr. Temple around?

10
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,400
He ain't here. Hotel is closed.

11
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:17,048
When will he be back?

12
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:19,002
I don't know.

13
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:33,245
Have a beer?

14
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:34,922
-The bar is closed.
-That's right.

15
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:37,000
I told you, didn't l?
Hotel's closed.

16
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,246
In the summer,
everything's closed.

17
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,481
Give him a drink.

18
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:45,281
Give him a drink!

19
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:50,083
You heard me!
Give him a drink!

20
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:53,806
You said beer?

21
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:55,604
Thank you.

22
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:58,520
Think nothing of it.

23
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:04,607
Bargain Lass on the outside
is running very fast and very hard.

24
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:08,248
Come on, Lady Bountiful.

25
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:10,081
Come on, Lady Bountiful!

26
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,240
Come on!

27
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:17,804
How's that for picking them?
Can l pick them or can't l?

28
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:23,803
That's him.

29
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:29,557
I'll take it up.

30
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:31,481
If he wants you,
he'll send for you.

31
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:40,206
I like Fancy Free.

32
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:42,281
Carrying 1 1 8 pounds.

33
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:45,168
That's a lot of weight.
What do you think?

34
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:46,962
Fancy Free.

35
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:48,767
-You play the ponies?
-No.

36
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:51,398
-Why not?
-I haven't the money.

37
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:54,759
Angel, another beer
for the gentleman.

38
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:56,801
I play the long shots.

39
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:59,085
Betting on a favorite,
what do you win?

40
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:01,604
When a horse comes in for me,
he pays plenty.

41
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:03,521
Take Fancy Free:

42
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:06,922
"Morning Line, 1 2-1 . "

43
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:08,522
That's ridiculous.

44
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:12,045
He should be 4-1 , even less.
Look at that breeding.

45
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:16,448
"By Chance Play, out of
Misconstrue by Omaha. "

46
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:18,600
He hasn't won in 1 1 starts, true.

47
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:20,760
But he's been twice on the money. . .

48
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:25,161
. . .and today he's running a $3000
claiming race. Ought to be a cinch!

49
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:27,158
What's your name?

50
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:30,321
McCloud. Frank.
By John, out of Helen.

51
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:32,084
I'm Miss Dawn.

52
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:33,565
Miss Gaye Dawn.

53
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:35,925
You. He wants you.

54
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,807
Please excuse me.

55
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,164
Who's that?

56
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:52,962
-I don't know.
-What's he want?

57
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:54,642
Old man Temple.

58
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,769
Look, mister, if you're
thinking of putting up here. . .

59
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,237
. . .the hotel's closed.

60
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:02,322
-Won't be open for another month.
-Why are you here?

61
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:03,763
-We're guests.
-But you said--

62
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,318
We're here by special arrangement.

63
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:09,403
I don't plan to stay.
I just wanna see Mr. Temple.

64
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:11,287
Oh, well, why didn't you say so?

65
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:13,247
He's out by the boathouse.

66
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:35,917
Mr. Temple?

67
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:38,007
My name's McCloud.
Frank McCloud.

68
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:39,728
McCloud, huh?

69
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:42,608
Not Major McCloud?

70
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:43,645
Yes, sir.

71
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:44,645
Nora!

72
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:47,044
Nora! Nora!

73
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:49,280
Come here!
When did you get here?

74
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:51,406
A few minutes ago.
I'm on my way to Key West.

75
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,640
Did you come on the bus?
l saw it stop.

76
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,242
Hey, Nora!

77
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:56,478
Hurry up!

78
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:57,639
Come here!

79
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:00,361
Look who's here!

80
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:02,201
This is George's wife.

81
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:03,802
This is Major Frank McCloud.

82
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:04,999
How do you do?

83
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:07,683
Your husband and l were
in the same outfit overseas.

84
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,408
As if she didn't know.

85
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:11,401
I wrote you a letter, major,
to St. Louis.

86
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:15,608
It was sent on to Portland, St. Paul
and Memphis before it came back.

87
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:17,919
-Ever been down here before?
-No, sir.

88
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,718
George was right.

89
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:22,847
The Keys are different than
anything l've seen. And hotter.

90
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:26,122
Don't look for it to get
any cooler before November.

91
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:28,998
The thermometer will go
down to about 1 00.

92
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,480
The sand flies and mosquitoes
will disappear.

93
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:35,841
It'll be right livable for about
three months on the Keys.

94
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,158
Except for tourists.

95
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:41,044
-That Black Caesar's Rock?
-How'd you know?

96
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:44,168
For one who's never been here,
l know a lot about these Keys.

97
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,400
They were a favorite subject
with George.

98
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:49,607
He used to dig for pirate gold
right over there.

99
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:53,728
He never lost hope of finding
Blackbeard's own treasure.

100
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:56,119
He must've dug 1 0,000 holes.

101
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,479
-Ever find anything?
-Oh, sure.

102
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:01,044
Salt water, every time.

103
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:03,200
How long will you be with us?

104
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,360
-An hour or so.
-An hour?

105
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:09,045
You can spare more time than that.
We got a lot to talk about.

106
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,281
-I'll talk as long as you like.
-Then you'll stay overnight.

107
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:14,642
He can have George's room.

108
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,242
Yes, Dad.

109
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:19,481
-May l help you?
-If you will.

110
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:23,081
Afternoon, Mrs. Temple.

111
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:29,760
Mr. Temple.
Any news of the Osceola brothers?

112
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,681
Oh, l'm sorry, Ben.

113
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:35,444
I want you to meet my son's
commanding officer, Major McCloud.

114
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:38,328
-How do you do?
-Officer Ben Wade. Sawyer.

115
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:41,564
We'd like to have a look around.

116
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:44,966
You won't find those lndians,
because they ain't here.

117
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:48,401
Maybe they're in the
mangrove swamps. Maybe.

118
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:51,721
Or maybe if you wanna go wading,
you might find them.

119
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:55,087
But if l was you,
l'd save myself the trouble.

120
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:58,162
No doubt they'll give
themselves up before morning.

121
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:02,206
They sure enough ought to.
That's a fact, Mr. Temple.

122
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,207
The longer they stay at large,
the tougher it'll be on them.

123
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:07,804
Fool lndians. 30 days to do
and they bust out.

124
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:10,005
Thirty days in jail for an lndian. . .

125
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,524
. . .is like 30 years for somebody else.

126
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:14,646
Anyway, l'd like to have
a look around.

127
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,767
Clyde, if Mr. Temple says
they ain't here, they ain't.

128
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:20,045
His word's good enough for me.

129
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:22,962
Sorry to bother you.
Come on, Clyde.

130
00:09:23,969 --> 00:09:27,439
Those two brothers and my boy, George,
grew up together.

131
00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:29,088
There's no harm in them.

132
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:32,844
They just went to Palm Grove
and got a little snootful. . .

133
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:35,557
. . .and started to take Florida
back for the lndians.

134
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,925
Came mighty near succeeding too.

135
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:40,888
I sent word for them to
come in and give themselves up.

136
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:44,485
Not that l'm supposed to know where
they are, you understand.

137
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:48,239
Major, l want you to meet Mr. . . .

138
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:49,798
-Bass.
-Garcia.

139
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,004
We've met.

140
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:54,246
My son's commanding officer overseas.

141
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:56,884
They were in the
ltalian campaign together.

142
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,438
From Salerno to Cassino.

143
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:03,645
My boy, George, was killed
in Cassino.

144
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:16,687
What's going on here?

145
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:17,918
Nothing, Mr. Temple.

146
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:19,602
What's the matter with her?

147
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:23,001
-Nora? Nora!
-Yes, Father.

148
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:25,001
What ails that girl? She hurt?

149
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:27,760
Case of one too many, that's all.

150
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:31,604
Look here! lf you people can't
behave yourselves, you gotta leave.

151
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:33,521
What did you hit her for?

152
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:36,278
I'll let you in on something.
She's a lush.

153
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:39,601
After she bends the elbow a few times,
she sees things:

154
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:42,204
Rats, roaches, snakes,
bats, you know.

155
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:45,646
A sock in the kisser is the only
thing that'll bring her out of it.

156
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:49,241
Your room's ready, major.

157
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:53,727
How long have they been here?

158
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:56,039
That one, Curly, and the woman
showed up first.

159
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,881
Dad Temple told them
we were closed. . .

160
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:00,199
. . .but he offered to rent
the whole hotel for a week.

161
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:03,009
It was so much money,
Dad couldn't turn it down.

162
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:05,843
Mr. Brown and the others arrived
in that boat four days ago.

163
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:07,238
Which one is Brown?

164
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:10,287
He's in number 1 1 .
Never comes out except at night.

165
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:11,598
What's he like?

166
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:13,487
He's a lady-killer,
or thinks so.

167
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:16,687
Rich, l guess. The others jump
when he lifts a finger.

168
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:18,806
Out of season in this heat.

169
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:21,961
Why would they decide
to sit down on Key Largo?

170
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:24,918
They'll be leaving here
tonight or tomorrow.

171
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:26,519
Major?

172
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:31,199
Were you with George when he died?

173
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:33,438
Was he in much pain?

174
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:35,641
He never knew what hit him.

175
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:38,879
I was afraid he might have suffered.

176
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:43,517
Come down to Dad's room
when you're ready.

177
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:15,562
Excuse me.

178
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,288
Staying the night, huh?

179
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:18,757
I'm Curly Hoff.

180
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:22,160
I heard how you were with
old man Temple's son in ltaly.

181
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,603
The kid got it?

182
00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:25,248
Too bad.

183
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:28,083
I hope you didn't take offense
how we handled you.

184
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:30,524
You caught Toots and me
at a bad time.

185
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:32,685
We were ready to bite
anybody's head off.

186
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:35,084
Especially a certain blond's.

187
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:38,082
Five of us come down here
for the deep-sea fishing.

188
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:39,808
All the way from Milwaukee.

189
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:44,088
More than a year, we'd been planning
to come here and fish our brains out.

190
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:46,763
So what happens?
One guy brings a blond.

191
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:49,239
And after we all swore
up and down, no dames!

192
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:51,286
But he's gotta bring her, this guy.

193
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:54,885
If she isn't drunk and crying,
she's got a hangover and arguing.

194
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:57,723
One minute she gets sore at you
and won't talk.

195
00:12:57,969 --> 00:13:00,722
Next she's making a play for you
right in front of the guy!

196
00:13:00,969 --> 00:13:03,199
And he gets sore at us,
mind you, not her.

197
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:06,481
Everything's spoiled,
including our dispositions.

198
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:09,243
It's cost us all this dough,
and for what?

199
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,320
The world's worst time.

200
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:13,799
I ask you, can you blame us
for getting rude?

201
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:16,279
-I don't blame you.
-How about a drink?

202
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:17,598
Not now, thanks.

203
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:18,884
Hotel Largo.

204
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,727
Just to show there's
no hard feelings.

205
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:22,004
No, thank you.

206
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:24,006
Thank you very much.

207
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:27,005
-Storm signals are up.
-What's that mean?

208
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:28,682
Hurricane's on its way.

209
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:31,159
See what l mean?
Hurricanes yet!

210
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:33,206
Dad's in here, major.

211
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:39,159
Sit down, major.

212
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:42,607
The war's over, Mr. Temple.
I'm not a major anymore.

213
00:13:42,849 --> 00:13:47,047
I know the men that went don't
like talking about the war. . .

214
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:50,087
. . .and l don't like imposing on you.

215
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,884
But this letter here
from the War Department. . .

216
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:55,165
. . .is the only facts we have.

217
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:58,799
And it leaves us in the dark
about a few things.

218
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:00,801
I'll tell you everything l know.

219
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,607
Will you, Frank? Will you?

220
00:14:02,849 --> 00:14:04,202
I'd be most grateful.

221
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:06,804
-Where shall l start?
-Anywhere.

222
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,198
He was a good soldier
from start to finish.

223
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,327
You'd have been proud.
Every man in his regiment was.

224
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:15,287
-Were they, Frank?
-With good reason.

225
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,959
It wasn't just a matter
of doing his duty.

226
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,359
He was always looking
for a way to do more.

227
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:23,247
And finding it.

228
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:25,400
George was a born hero.

229
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:28,569
He couldn't imagine his death.
Only dishonor.

230
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:30,447
No, of course not.

231
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:32,520
It's a wonder he lasted
till Cassino.

232
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:36,758
When you believe like George believed,
dying isn't very important.

233
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:42,482
Once, outside San Pietro,
George and a couple others. . .

234
00:14:42,729 --> 00:14:44,720
. . .established an observation post.

235
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:47,363
They got a direct hit,
and the others were killed.

236
00:14:47,609 --> 00:14:48,837
That left it up to George.

237
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:52,758
Three days and three nights
he stayed awake directing our fire.

238
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:56,401
Most of that time, l was on
the other end of the line.

239
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:59,561
To keep himself awake,
he talked into the phone.

240
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:02,159
Talked and talked.

241
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,525
Most of his talk
was about you two.

242
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:07,678
You'd be surprised how much
l know about you both.

243
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:11,286
For instance, inside your
wedding ring there's an inscription:

244
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:12,564
"Evermore. "

245
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:14,518
That's right.

246
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:15,964
And you, Mr. Temple.

247
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:19,800
Remember telling George what
this hollow is above the upper lip?

248
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:21,808
Before he was born,
you said. . .

249
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:24,244
. . .he knew all the secrets
of life and death.

250
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:28,808
And then at his birth, an angel
came and put his finger right here.

251
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:30,203
And sealed his lips.

252
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,561
I remember that.

253
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,845
He couldn't have been more
than 7 years old. . .

254
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:39,319
. . .when l told him that fairy story.

255
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:41,807
What's it like where he's buried?

256
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:45,843
Just crosses on a slope.

257
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:48,884
High up, there's
what's left of a church.

258
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:51,484
You can see a river
from where George is.

259
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:55,283
I'd like to pay a visit to that place.

260
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:57,886
Yep, l would.

261
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:01,480
Nora, maybe we'll do just that.

262
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:05,439
Go to ltaly and see
where George is buried.

263
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:09,002
It belongs to us, don't it?
That plot of ground?

264
00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:12,959
I'm very grateful to you, Frank.

265
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:14,085
Thank you.

266
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:21,960
There was a storm warning, Dad.

267
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:23,927
You better see to the boat.

268
00:16:55,969 --> 00:16:57,288
What brought you here?

269
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:59,759
Thought l might make
my living on the sea.

270
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:02,638
-Doing what?
-Doesn't matter. Hand on a boat.

271
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,801
Life on land's become
too complicated for my taste.

272
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:07,528
What'd you do before the war?

273
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:09,441
I was circulation manager
for a newspaper.

274
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,118
-You never went back to it?
-I couldn't stick it.

275
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:16,042
I've done lots since the paper.

276
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:19,008
Driving taxis, waiting on tables.
Anything to make a dollar.

277
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:20,927
Including day labor.

278
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,447
Getting kind of rough.

279
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:25,008
Major, this is Mr. Feeney.

280
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:26,523
-Hi.
-How do you do?

281
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,887
How's your ground tackle
off the stern?

282
00:17:31,129 --> 00:17:32,403
Plenty heavy.

283
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:35,641
Then we'd just better double up
on these bowlines.

284
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:41,760
Where'd you learn about boats?

285
00:17:41,969 --> 00:17:44,437
My first sweetheart was a boat.

286
00:17:48,249 --> 00:17:50,046
How do you like that boat?

287
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:54,005
Nice. She should be away from
those reefs with this blow coming.

288
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:55,841
That so?

289
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,405
Put that on that piling over there.

290
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:34,559
Charlie!

291
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:37,684
Charlie Wenoka and his family
from Crawfish lsland.

292
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,401
The Wenokas are royalty.
Charlie's a Seminole prince.

293
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:44,199
His ancestors go back to the gods.

294
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:47,168
He sells seashells by the seashore.

295
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:17,681
Hello, Mama Ochobee.

296
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:20,523
Every lndian here is
a descendent of Mama Ochobee.

297
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:24,398
She admits to being 1 08 years old.
But she has a son who's 1 1 2.

298
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:27,322
We suspect Mama doesn't tell
the truth about her age.

299
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:31,562
Him new husband? No, Mama.
Not new husband.

300
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:36,161
You got cigarette?

301
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:48,243
Pretty big blow coming?

302
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:57,203
Indians always know.
Don't ask me how, but they do.

303
00:19:57,449 --> 00:20:00,919
More will be along. They come to
us from as far as Matecumbe Key.

304
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:04,286
This one was born in our lobby
during the last big blow.

305
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,517
Hello, Tom.
Hello, John.

306
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:10,282
Tom and John are Osceola.

307
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:12,121
How do you do?

308
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:15,959
We get Mr. Temple message.
We hear give ourself up to police.

309
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:17,562
He thinks it's the best.

310
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:19,561
What Mr. Temple say, we do.

311
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:21,288
Him good friend to lndian.

312
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:24,441
Why don't you go to the hotel?
Dad'll call Palm Grove.

313
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,202
Thanks, Miss Nora.

314
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:36,648
Poor fellas got into some trouble
and were arrested.

315
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:38,925
I know.
Mr. Temple told me about them.

316
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:41,637
They really trust Dad Temple.
All the lndians.

317
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:45,000
As far as they're concerned,
he's the United States of America.

318
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:46,881
You're very happy here,
aren't you?

319
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:49,404
-Very.
-You're never lonely?

320
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:53,437
Did George tell you?
l met him at a USO dance.

321
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:55,725
He was lonesome.
He wanted company.

322
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:57,841
I was working at a defense plant.

323
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:00,523
I knew lots of people,
but l was lonesome too.

324
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,244
Before George, my life
hadn't made much sense.

325
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:06,640
I never had much of a home,
and l didn't like what l had.

326
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:08,444
George. . .

327
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,122
. . .gave me roots.

328
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,008
When he went overseas,
l came here to stay with his father. . .

329
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:14,688
. . .and the roots took hold.

330
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:18,001
Now l'm like one of those mangroves.

331
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:31,247
Our police always get their lndian.

332
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:34,083
Close the shutters
while l get the oil lamps.

333
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:12,603
Hey, pal.
Getting ready for the hurricane?

334
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:15,568
-Join me for that little drink now?
-No, thanks.

335
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:17,959
-Not a drinking man?
-Not right now.

336
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:19,039
Hey, Curly.

337
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:21,086
What all happens in a hurricane?

338
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:24,207
The wind blows so hard
the ocean gets up on its hind legs. . .

339
00:22:24,449 --> 00:22:26,087
. . .and walks right across the land.

340
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:27,762
And singing a song:

341
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:31,081
Rain, rain go away
Little Ralphie wants to play

342
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:34,920
Isn't that Ben Wade's car?

343
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:36,761
Nora! Have you seen him?

344
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:38,641
No, Dad. I haven't.

345
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:42,888
They're snooping around looking
for these two boys, and here they are.

346
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:46,360
Better go out there and sit
in his car and wait for him.

347
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:49,197
Better yet, go and find him.

348
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:53,964
What's so funny, Toots?

349
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:55,642
There are two cons in a cell.

350
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:58,124
One tries to sell the other
a fountain pen.

351
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:01,003
And he says,
"This pen is guaranteed for life. "

352
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:02,964
Don't you get it?

353
00:23:03,489 --> 00:23:04,444
A con.

354
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:06,202
Guaranteed for life.

355
00:23:06,449 --> 00:23:07,598
We get it, all right.

356
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:10,647
Have you seen Wade or Sawyer
anywhere around, Frank?

357
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:11,645
No, l haven't.

358
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,682
-His car's out there in the rain.
-Yes, l know.

359
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:16,078
It's funny.

360
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:18,923
How about a drink, everybody?
What'll it be, Miss Temple?

361
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:20,238
Nothing, thanks.

362
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:21,604
How about you, Pop?

363
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:24,044
He's not supposed to drink anything.

364
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:26,245
That leaves it up to you, pal.

365
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:27,882
Another time.

366
00:23:28,129 --> 00:23:29,198
Don't you like me?

367
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,327
I'm beginning to think
l got smallpox or something.

368
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:36,840
Still laughing at that
stinking joke?

369
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:37,999
Here's another one.

370
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:39,921
Elevator's busting through a roof.

371
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:42,803
The elevator boy says
to a couple passengers:

372
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:44,806
"l told you there was
no 1 1 th floor. "

373
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:49,561
Explain it for us, Toots.

374
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:51,959
Wise guy.

375
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:57,207
What's the idea of them?

376
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:00,601
They shut the electricity off,
we still have light.

377
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:04,645
I hear a hurricane blows off roofs
and puts the snatch on people.

378
00:24:04,889 --> 00:24:07,767
And they all fly around
in the sky together. Is that right?

379
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:09,244
Absolutely.

380
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,799
It's raining in on Ben's car.
Better close the windows, Nora.

381
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:15,205
Ralph, go put up the windows
in that car.

382
00:24:15,449 --> 00:24:18,759
And get caught out in that hurricane?
Not me, brother.

383
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:20,397
I'll take it.

384
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:25,602
Don't you answer it.

385
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:34,238
No, Mr. Temple's not here now.

386
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:36,885
No, she's not here either.

387
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:38,239
Me?

388
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:40,719
I'm a guest at the hotel.

389
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:42,922
No, we haven't seen him.

390
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:44,761
Give me that phone!

391
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:49,204
Yes. If Sawyer shows up,
l'll have him call you right back.

392
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:57,441
Easy does it, soldier.

393
00:25:31,449 --> 00:25:34,646
The phone rang, and the girl
started for it and l stopped her.

394
00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:37,801
The soldier wants to get rough,
so we show him our rods.

395
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:41,246
I'm glad the old man's in a wheelchair.
He'd be lots of trouble.

396
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:43,559
-Who was on the phone?
-The law.

397
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,127
That means he won't be long.

398
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:47,245
Then what?

399
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:48,683
We'll see.

400
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:57,328
You'd think this rain would
cool things off, but it don't.

401
00:25:58,249 --> 00:26:00,717
-Gonna have a hurricane?
-So they say.

402
00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:02,607
I'm not afraid of that gun!

403
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:04,567
Go ahead! Shoot!

404
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:06,846
You haven't got the nerve.

405
00:26:10,209 --> 00:26:11,085
Brown!

406
00:26:11,329 --> 00:26:13,206
Hey, you! Brown!

407
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:33,962
Are you thieves?
You want money? ls this a robbery?

408
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:36,439
That's right.
We'll steal all your towels.

409
00:26:36,689 --> 00:26:40,398
That big gun in your hand
makes you look grown-up, you think!

410
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:44,198
I'll bet you spend hours posing
in front of a mirror holding it.

411
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:45,723
Trying to look tough!

412
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:47,687
-Shut up.
-You scum!

413
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:53,559
-Tell him to stop calling me names.
-Shut up, Toots.

414
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,638
Now listen.

415
00:26:57,809 --> 00:26:59,527
I don't want any trouble.

416
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:04,688
With you. With anybody.
How about it, gonna act sensible?

417
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:06,487
Why are they pointing guns?

418
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:08,003
Forget the questions.

419
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:10,160
What you don't know won't hurt you.

420
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:12,445
We'll be out of here
in a couple of hours.

421
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:14,800
Try to put up with us that long.

422
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:17,358
What'll we eat tonight?

423
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:18,678
Pompano, maybe?

424
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:21,403
Am l to understand
we're your prisoners?

425
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:23,287
Well, put it this way, Pop. . .

426
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:26,487
. . .you're gonna be my guests
for a little while.

427
00:27:27,969 --> 00:27:32,087
Back in Chi, in the old days, we'd pay
$1 0 for an order of pompano.

428
00:27:33,209 --> 00:27:35,882
They used to fly it in.
The way they served it. . .

429
00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:38,120
. . .done up in a brown paper bag. . . .

430
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:40,239
Got any champagne?

431
00:27:41,969 --> 00:27:42,879
No champagne.

432
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:45,085
Well, that's too bad.

433
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:47,479
Champagne and pompano.

434
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:49,606
They really go together.

435
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,283
This one's coming around.

436
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:00,801
Still feel tough?

437
00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:16,887
You won't get away
with it, Rocco.

438
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:28,043
Why'd you hurt him?

439
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:30,203
He's a cop, that's why.

440
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:31,558
Well, who are you?

441
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:33,208
Why are you here?

442
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:36,249
-Answer me!
-Stop hollering, old man.

443
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:38,521
Johnny Rocco, of course.

444
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:41,318
Hot water.

445
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:45,678
Get some.

446
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:49,842
Yeah, that's right.

447
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:51,808
Johnny Rocco.

448
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:54,404
-I know that name.
-Sure, who doesn't?

449
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,038
Johnny Rocco the gangster,
Mr. Temple.

450
00:28:57,289 --> 00:28:58,961
The one and only Rocco.

451
00:28:59,209 --> 00:29:01,200
Rocco. Rocco?

452
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:03,886
What's that, Pop?
l'm kind of deaf.

453
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:05,244
Rocco!

454
00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:08,767
He said, "Rocco. "

455
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:14,521
But they threw you
out of the country.

456
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:18,323
Yeah, that's right.

457
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:21,763
After living in the U.S.A.
for more than 30 years. . .

458
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:23,647
. . .they called me
an undesirable alien.

459
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:25,927
Me, Johnny Rocco!

460
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:29,009
Like l was a dirty Red or something!

461
00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:30,602
Then how could you be here?

462
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:33,560
Well, maybe l'm not, Pop.

463
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:36,198
This ain't real.
You're having a dream.

464
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:37,723
Wake up. You're snoring.

465
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,203
You're right!

466
00:29:39,449 --> 00:29:41,485
You shouldn't have been deported.

467
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:43,526
You should've been exterminated!

468
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:51,959
I apologize for Mr. Temple. He
doesn't know what he's talking about.

469
00:29:53,729 --> 00:29:56,197
Rocco was more than a king.
He was an emperor.

470
00:29:56,449 --> 00:29:59,282
His rule extended over beer,
slot machines, the numbers racket. . .

471
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:01,247
. . .and other forbidden enterprises.

472
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:03,282
He was a master of the fix.

473
00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:06,800
Whom he couldn't corrupt,
he terrified or murdered.

474
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:10,041
You filth! You city filth!

475
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:13,406
Mr. Temple, you're
hopelessly old-fashioned.

476
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:16,999
Your ideas date back years
to the time when America thought. . .

477
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:19,638
. . .it could get along
without the Johnny Roccos.

478
00:30:19,849 --> 00:30:22,204
Welcome back.
It was all a mistake.

479
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:24,919
America's sorry for what
it did to you.

480
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:27,166
On the level, boss,
were you that big?

481
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,161
On the level,
are you that dumb?

482
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:34,567
Yeah, that's me.

483
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:37,640
Sure, l was all of those things.

484
00:30:37,889 --> 00:30:38,958
And more!

485
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:41,679
When Rocco talked,
everybody listened!

486
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:43,647
What Rocco said, went!

487
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:45,726
Nobody was as big as Rocco!

488
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:48,719
It'll be like that again,
only more so!

489
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:52,359
I'll be back up there one day.
Then you'll really see something!

490
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:55,077
If the time ever comes
when your kind. . .

491
00:30:55,329 --> 00:30:57,399
. . .can walk a city street
in daylight. . .

492
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,605
. . .with nothing to fear
from the people--

493
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:02,283
The time has come, Mr. Temple.
It's here.

494
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:06,287
You know all about me.

495
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:09,200
Now, what's with you, wise guy?

496
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:11,599
Well, give.

497
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:13,887
In the war, weren't you?

498
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:16,878
-Get any medals?
-A couple.

499
00:31:17,729 --> 00:31:19,959
-Brave?
-Not very.

500
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,524
-Why'd you stick your neck out?
-No good reason.

501
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:24,202
What are you saying?

502
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:27,445
I believed some words.

503
00:31:27,689 --> 00:31:29,202
Words? What words?

504
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:31,201
Well, they went like this:

505
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:35,078
"But we aren't making all this
sacrifice of human effort and lives. . .

506
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:39,527
. . .to return to the kind of a world
we had after the last world war.

507
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:51,965
We're fighting to cleanse
the world of ancient evils.

508
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:53,562
Ancient ills. "

509
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,278
What's that about?

510
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:58,762
I remember those words.

511
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:00,078
That makes two of us.

512
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:04,646
We rid ourselves of your kind
once and for all!

513
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,607
You ain't coming back!

514
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:08,885
Who's gonna stop me, old man?

515
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:10,921
If l wasn't a cripple--

516
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:13,637
You wouldn't be talking this way.
Right, Pop?

517
00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:16,005
Filth! You filth!

518
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:17,045
Get him, will you!

519
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:18,921
-Sic him, Pop!
-Stand your ground!

520
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:21,046
You're killing me, Pop!

521
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:24,998
Come on, Pop!
You're not quitting, are you?

522
00:32:25,249 --> 00:32:27,922
My boy, George, never quit,
and l ain't quitting!

523
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:30,319
That's the spirit, Pop!
Never say die!

524
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,601
You little wildcat!

525
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,482
Smelled blood, huh?

526
00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:50,561
Got your appetite up, huh?

527
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:53,365
Hey, boss.

528
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:55,440
Miami wants you on the phone.

529
00:33:15,449 --> 00:33:17,724
The people on the porch
look like lndians.

530
00:33:17,969 --> 00:33:19,880
-What do they want?
-They want in.

531
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:21,403
-What for?
-The hurricane.

532
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:22,923
Keep them out.

533
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:26,527
Yeah, this is Mr. Brown.

534
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:30,169
Hello, Ziggy! How are you?

535
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:32,520
I recognized your voice.

536
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,880
Well, swell hearing it again.

537
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:38,078
How's every little thing?

538
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,800
-Maybe it's the law.
-Show him in.

539
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:42,118
That's swell.

540
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:43,688
This end too.

541
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:45,806
Look, when are you coming down?

542
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:49,242
What hurricane? That right?

543
00:33:54,729 --> 00:33:56,924
-I want to see the boss.
-It's the skipper!

544
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:58,761
Mr. Temple, please!

545
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:01,887
You're only two hours away.
You can beat the hurricane out.

546
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:03,961
No, it's gotta be tonight.

547
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:06,206
Yeah, see you in a couple of hours.

548
00:34:06,449 --> 00:34:07,245
Bye.

549
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:11,083
Storm warning. Big blow on the way.

550
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:13,604
-So what?
-This coral reef not safe.

551
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:15,805
Got to make for deep water
right away.

552
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:17,323
That boat stays here.

553
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:19,878
Too dangerous. Boat break up on reef.

554
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:22,324
I tell you when to move that boat.

555
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:23,797
I am skipper.

556
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:25,604
Now, look.

557
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:26,958
I paid you.

558
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:29,166
-You do what l say.
-Please, senor.

559
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:31,240
You want half money back? l give.

560
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:33,047
But got to move boat.

561
00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:34,648
Give me your rod.

562
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,203
See this?

563
00:34:37,729 --> 00:34:40,243
You move that boat,
l'll blow your brains out.

564
00:34:43,569 --> 00:34:45,207
We'll be out of here in two hours.

565
00:34:45,569 --> 00:34:46,604
I'll be ready.

566
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:49,124
Go out and move that car
around the back.

567
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:52,368
I come back here looking
for those Osceola boys.

568
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:54,804
I knew they were somewhere around here.

569
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:57,764
Down the lobby,
l ran up against these two.

570
00:34:58,009 --> 00:35:01,240
They didn't look right to me,
so l asked them a few questions.

571
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:03,957
By the way they answered,
there was something fishy.

572
00:35:04,209 --> 00:35:08,327
So l put in a call to Ben Wade,
but the lights went out on me.

573
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:12,086
I woke up in there.

574
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:13,848
Rocco was standing over me.

575
00:35:14,169 --> 00:35:16,808
I recognized him right away
from pictures.

576
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:19,882
I made a break for the door,
and the lights went out again.

577
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:21,524
I'm the electrician.

578
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:34,005
Angel.

579
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:35,204
Shave.

580
00:35:36,089 --> 00:35:37,920
What did Miami have to say?

581
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:39,727
Everything's okay.

582
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:41,841
How soon will they be down?

583
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:44,086
They were leaving right away.

584
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:50,161
How're you feeling, copper?

585
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:53,159
I'll say one thing,
you sure can take it.

586
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:57,206
By the way Toots poured it on,
l'm surprised you ever woke up.

587
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,440
Boy, sure is hot.

588
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:02,722
Not too close.

589
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:05,920
So l won't get away with it, huh?

590
00:36:06,689 --> 00:36:09,157
How many times l heard that
from dumb coppers.

591
00:36:09,409 --> 00:36:10,444
I still say it.

592
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:15,047
You'd give your left eye
to nail me, wouldn't you?

593
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:18,600
You can see the headlines, can't you?

594
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:21,727
"Local Deputy Captures Johnny Rocco. "

595
00:36:21,969 --> 00:36:24,358
Your picture would be
in all the papers.

596
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:27,919
You might even get to tell on
the newsreel how you pulled it off.

597
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:31,128
Well, listen, hick.

598
00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:34,680
I was too much for any big-city
police force to handle.

599
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:37,045
They tried, but they couldn't.

600
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,489
Took the U.S. government
to pin a rap on me.

601
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:43,118
Yeah, and they won't make it stick!

602
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:45,362
You hick!

603
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:48,248
I'll be getting guys elected
mayor and governor. . .

604
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:50,719
. . .before you ever get a $1 0 raise!

605
00:36:51,969 --> 00:36:54,961
How many of those guys in office
owe everything to me?

606
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:56,604
I made them.

607
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:00,319
I made them, just like a tailor
makes a suit of clothes.

608
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:03,879
I take a nobody, teach him what to say,
get his name in the papers.

609
00:37:04,129 --> 00:37:05,881
I pay for his campaign expenses.

610
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:09,521
Dish out a lot of groceries and coal.

611
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,805
Get my boys to bring the voters out.

612
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:13,562
Then count the votes again. . .

613
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:16,118
. . .till they added up right,
and he was elected.

614
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:18,962
Then what happened?

615
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:22,483
Did he remember
when the going got tough?

616
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:24,003
When the heat was on?

617
00:37:24,249 --> 00:37:26,001
No, he didn't want to.

618
00:37:26,249 --> 00:37:28,558
All he wanted was
to save his own dirty neck.

619
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:31,562
That's enough of that.
Give me a towel, will you?

620
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:34,644
"Public Enemy," he calls me!

621
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:39,408
Me, who gave him his public
all wrapped up with a fancy bow on it!

622
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:41,168
Angel, lay my clothes out.

623
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:43,206
-What suit?
-The gray one.

624
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:46,566
-What color shirt?
-A white one, of course.

625
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:53,445
Some little wildcat.

626
00:37:56,249 --> 00:37:58,683
I knew one like you a long time ago.

627
00:37:59,169 --> 00:38:01,444
Scratched, kicked, bit.

628
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:03,128
Regular hellion.

629
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:06,685
She even stuck a knife in me once.

630
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:09,088
Irish kid.

631
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,763
Little and kind of skinny she was. . .

632
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:13,886
. . .but a real fireball.

633
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:16,960
Her name was Maggie Mooney.

634
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:21,645
But for professional reasons,
l had to change it to Gaye Dawn.

635
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,125
She was a knockout in those days.

636
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:52,721
Why, you--

637
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:15,727
Go ahead, boss, smack her.
Get it out of your system.

638
00:39:15,969 --> 00:39:18,324
Look at him. The great Johnny Rocco.

639
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:21,003
With Nora's spittle
hanging from his face!

640
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:22,159
Shut up, old man!

641
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:24,843
Come over here.
I'd like to spit on you.

642
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:26,124
Give me!

643
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:27,444
Give me!

644
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:32,841
Nothing to stop me from
wiping you all out!

645
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:35,887
What good'll that do?
Her kind's a dime a dozen.

646
00:39:36,129 --> 00:39:37,881
Smack her and let it go at that.

647
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:40,206
That'd be right for you,
not for him.

648
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:42,482
I didn't ask for your advice!

649
00:39:42,729 --> 00:39:44,447
The Roccos don't, or they
wouldn't be Roccos.

650
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:48,606
No, smacking her isn't enough.
He'd have to kill her.

651
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:51,445
Then he'd have to kill
those who witnessed it.

652
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:54,522
Not just Mr. Temple and me,
but all the witnesses.

653
00:39:55,449 --> 00:39:56,723
It's all or nothing.

654
00:39:56,969 --> 00:39:59,608
He needs you and Curly and Angel.

655
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:00,884
So it'll be nothing.

656
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,758
Wise guy.

657
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:07,122
Unlock this door!

658
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:10,008
Unlock this door! l want out!

659
00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:13,008
Let her out.

660
00:40:22,729 --> 00:40:24,640
I take off my hat to you, soldier.

661
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:28,404
It's good you said what you said,
or he'd have started shooting.

662
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:32,437
Close shave for you folks.
Closer than the one he got from Angel.

663
00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:37,997
Where is everybody? Downstairs?

664
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:45,008
Hello, everybody.

665
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:46,644
Hi, fella.

666
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:51,003
Where's Johnny?

667
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,602
He's in there getting dressed.

668
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:54,407
I need a drink.

669
00:40:54,649 --> 00:40:56,799
What's everybody doing upstairs?

670
00:40:58,329 --> 00:40:59,284
Honey?

671
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:02,886
Have you been crying?

672
00:41:03,209 --> 00:41:05,404
Why? Has somebody been
mean to you?

673
00:41:05,649 --> 00:41:08,686
Did you make her cry?
lf you did, you ought to be ashamed!

674
00:41:08,929 --> 00:41:11,204
-How about a little drink?
-No, thanks.

675
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:14,168
Oh, come on.
It'll chase the blues away.

676
00:41:15,049 --> 00:41:16,562
-I'll have one.
-The boss said--

677
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:19,164
I don't care what the boss said.
I need a drink.

678
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:22,204
-Good evening, Mr. Temple.
-Miss.

679
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:24,002
You got a cigarette?

680
00:41:26,169 --> 00:41:27,648
Did your horse win?

681
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:28,719
My horse?

682
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:30,687
No, l'm afraid he
ran out of the money.

683
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:32,248
I'm sorry.

684
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:46,404
I think l'll go to my room.

685
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:51,522
I feel faint.

686
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:54,167
What l need is a drink.

687
00:41:54,649 --> 00:41:56,082
That's what l need.

688
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:57,399
Say, how about it?

689
00:41:57,649 --> 00:41:58,764
How many times do l
have to tell--?

690
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:00,488
The boss say no more drink.

691
00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:02,242
Oh, he did, did he?

692
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:03,717
Well, this is a free country.

693
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:05,960
If l want a drink, l can have one.

694
00:42:06,729 --> 00:42:08,845
I can buy my own. There!

695
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:09,885
Sorry.

696
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:13,401
-The boss say--
-The boss! The boss! He can go to--

697
00:42:14,129 --> 00:42:15,482
Hello, darling.

698
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:18,557
How come it's hotter at night
than in the day?

699
00:42:19,249 --> 00:42:21,285
And when it's raining
than when it ain't?

700
00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:23,277
Huh, wise guy?

701
00:42:23,489 --> 00:42:24,285
I don't know.

702
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:26,968
You don't know.

703
00:42:27,209 --> 00:42:29,359
I thought you knew
all the answers.

704
00:42:29,609 --> 00:42:31,759
I thought you was a wise guy
from way back.

705
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:33,965
Darling, you've hurt yourself!

706
00:42:34,209 --> 00:42:36,404
Your face! How in the world--?

707
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:45,163
-What's funny?
-Nothing.

708
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:46,958
Why'd you laugh?

709
00:42:47,209 --> 00:42:48,642
I don't know.

710
00:42:48,889 --> 00:42:50,447
Dumbbell.

711
00:42:51,809 --> 00:42:53,481
What's worse, Curly?

712
00:42:53,729 --> 00:42:56,084
A dumbbell or a wise guy?

713
00:42:56,329 --> 00:42:58,399
A wise guy, l guess.

714
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:01,966
Got a million dollars?

715
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:05,801
-How much?
-Nothing.

716
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:06,959
But you're a wise guy.

717
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:11,002
You see, l was educated
only in impractical things.

718
00:43:11,249 --> 00:43:12,648
With you, it's the opposite.

719
00:43:15,809 --> 00:43:17,322
I'm afraid. I hate thunder.

720
00:43:17,569 --> 00:43:18,797
Is this it? ls it?

721
00:43:19,049 --> 00:43:21,244
-It's the beginning.
-I'm afraid!

722
00:43:21,489 --> 00:43:23,366
Can cars get through
during a hurricane?

723
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:25,685
Maybe. Maybe not.

724
00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:27,887
I think l'll have. . .

725
00:43:28,129 --> 00:43:30,165
. . .a scotch and water, please.

726
00:43:31,169 --> 00:43:33,205
-Please, darling!
-No!

727
00:43:34,049 --> 00:43:35,687
What you were saying is true.

728
00:43:36,089 --> 00:43:38,045
Only you don't believe it.
I see through you.

729
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:40,166
You think,
"l'm better than Rocco.

730
00:43:40,769 --> 00:43:43,966
He's filth! "
Like the old man said. Right?

731
00:43:44,209 --> 00:43:45,039
Right!

732
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,086
"He has a gun," you think,
"l haven't. "

733
00:43:47,289 --> 00:43:48,961
You figure it's the gun.

734
00:43:49,689 --> 00:43:51,042
Well, listen, soldier. . .

735
00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:54,804
. . .thousands of guys got guns,
but there's only one Johnny Rocco!

736
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,198
How do you account for it?

737
00:43:56,489 --> 00:43:57,717
He knows what he wants.

738
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,482
-Don't you, Rocco?
-Sure!

739
00:43:59,729 --> 00:44:00,559
What's that?

740
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:02,162
Tell him, Rocco.

741
00:44:02,569 --> 00:44:04,048
Well, l want. . . .

742
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:06,678
He wants more. Don't you, Rocco?

743
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:08,686
That's it! More.

744
00:44:08,929 --> 00:44:10,248
That's right, l want more!

745
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:11,888
Will you ever get enough?

746
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:13,562
Will you, Rocco?

747
00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:15,288
Well, l never have.

748
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:17,247
No, l guess l won't.

749
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:19,488
Do you know what you want?

750
00:44:20,009 --> 00:44:22,728
Yes, and l had hopes once,
but l gave them up.

751
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:24,197
Hopes for what?

752
00:44:24,409 --> 00:44:26,969
A world in which there's
no place for Johnny Rocco.

753
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,000
Okay, soldier.

754
00:44:35,129 --> 00:44:36,084
Here's your chance.

755
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:37,524
Give me!

756
00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:43,688
Okay, soldier, you can make
your hopes come true.

757
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:46,201
But you gotta die for it.

758
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:48,246
See where l'm aiming?
At your belly.

759
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:50,165
Go ahead, shoot.

760
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:53,687
-Get away, sister.
-Get away.

761
00:44:53,929 --> 00:44:54,884
Shoot!

762
00:44:55,969 --> 00:44:58,847
All right, you got a gun now.
You gonna use it or not?

763
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:00,564
Kill him, major!

764
00:45:00,809 --> 00:45:02,527
Yeah, kill him, major!

765
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:05,366
Show them how you're
not afraid to die.

766
00:45:05,609 --> 00:45:06,724
Shoot!

767
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:17,200
Looks like you don't
want it enough.

768
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:23,485
He laughs when something's
funny for a change.

769
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:27,399
One Rocco more or less
isn't worth dying for.

770
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:30,117
Give me that gun.

771
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:31,882
No, l'm afraid you'd use it.

772
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:35,726
One old man more or less
isn't worth dying for.

773
00:45:36,569 --> 00:45:37,968
What's the matter, sister?

774
00:45:39,009 --> 00:45:41,682
You look like you
lost somebody near and dear.

775
00:45:44,489 --> 00:45:45,842
A live war hero.

776
00:45:47,089 --> 00:45:49,080
Now l know how you did it.

777
00:45:50,689 --> 00:45:51,883
Curly, Gaye, anybody!

778
00:45:52,129 --> 00:45:53,005
Want a hero?

779
00:45:53,249 --> 00:45:54,967
Here's one for sale, cheap!

780
00:45:55,649 --> 00:45:57,526
All right, Rocco.

781
00:45:57,769 --> 00:45:58,645
All right!

782
00:45:59,609 --> 00:46:01,759
Let's you and me play
that game now!

783
00:46:02,649 --> 00:46:05,209
You can stop me
from going out that door.

784
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:07,565
But you gotta die first.

785
00:46:08,249 --> 00:46:10,558
If he shoots me,
you still get it.

786
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:12,438
Get out of my way.

787
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:20,087
Get away from that door!

788
00:46:45,049 --> 00:46:46,880
The gun wasn't loaded.

789
00:46:48,649 --> 00:46:50,640
He didn't have a chance.

790
00:46:51,889 --> 00:46:53,004
Murderer.

791
00:46:54,089 --> 00:46:55,761
Had to do it, old man.

792
00:46:56,449 --> 00:46:58,724
Or he would've been
out that door and gone.

793
00:46:58,969 --> 00:47:00,038
He's gone now.

794
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:04,401
That's right, sister.
The gun wasn't loaded.

795
00:47:04,649 --> 00:47:06,002
But our hero didn't know it.

796
00:47:16,089 --> 00:47:18,808
You knew the gun was empty,
didn't you, son?

797
00:47:19,049 --> 00:47:20,562
You could tell by the weight.

798
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:22,037
No, sir. I didn't know.

799
00:47:22,289 --> 00:47:23,768
He just didn't have
the nerve.

800
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,038
Let's face it.

801
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:26,608
You were smart, fella.

802
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:28,805
What happened to him
would've happened to you.

803
00:47:29,049 --> 00:47:31,961
It's better to be a live coward
than a dead hero.

804
00:47:33,249 --> 00:47:34,568
Excuse me.

805
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:37,725
You weren't afraid.
We all know that.

806
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:39,448
Oh, yes, l was afraid.

807
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:41,327
But that's not why
l didn't shoot.

808
00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:44,083
What do l care whether
Johnny Rocco lives or dies?

809
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:46,320
I only care about me!
Me and mine!

810
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:49,886
Rocco wants to come back to America,
let him! Let him be President!

811
00:47:50,129 --> 00:47:52,199
I fight nobody's battles but my own.

812
00:47:52,409 --> 00:47:54,206
I can't see it your way, Frank.

813
00:47:54,889 --> 00:47:56,447
Sawyer didn't either.

814
00:47:56,689 --> 00:47:57,678
He was a fool!

815
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:01,167
Me, die to rid the world
of a Johnny Rocco?!

816
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:02,845
No, thanks!

817
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:05,439
If l believed your way. . .

818
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,999
. . .I'd want to be dead too.

819
00:48:10,009 --> 00:48:11,124
It's true.

820
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:12,997
You are a coward.

821
00:48:13,249 --> 00:48:15,558
What you're saying now
is only to save face!

822
00:48:16,049 --> 00:48:17,038
Now, Nora. . .

823
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:19,200
. . .maybe Frank's right.

824
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:21,603
Maybe he's right.

825
00:49:14,609 --> 00:49:17,407
What's the idea, Ziggy?
Why ain't you started yet?

826
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:19,117
So what?

827
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:23,443
What's the matter, you guys?
Didn't l take chances?

828
00:49:23,689 --> 00:49:27,204
I make the run from Cuba, risk my
neck, my boat and the shipment. . .

829
00:49:27,409 --> 00:49:29,001
. . .and you won't come out
in the rain?

830
00:49:29,249 --> 00:49:32,764
Listen to me. Either you show
tonight or the deal is off.

831
00:49:33,009 --> 00:49:36,399
I know a dozen guys who'd break
their necks to get this shipment.

832
00:49:36,649 --> 00:49:38,446
Look, my watch says. . .

833
00:49:38,689 --> 00:49:39,485
. . .8:00.

834
00:49:39,689 --> 00:49:42,806
I give you two hours.
You ain't here by 1 0, the deal is off.

835
00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:44,688
Hello!

836
00:50:03,009 --> 00:50:04,647
Downstairs, everybody.

837
00:50:36,449 --> 00:50:37,882
Didn't l say no drinking?

838
00:50:38,129 --> 00:50:40,438
Please, honey. Just one?

839
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:56,441
Bring down the shipment.

840
00:50:58,449 --> 00:50:59,768
In there.

841
00:51:12,609 --> 00:51:14,486
Mr. Temple! Mr. Temple!

842
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:16,078
Wait.

843
00:51:16,569 --> 00:51:18,525
Is that someone calling?

844
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:21,084
Indians were at the door.
I sent them away.

845
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:22,682
You'd no right!

846
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:30,605
Listen to it.

847
00:51:30,849 --> 00:51:34,603
The upstairs shutters gotta be closed,
or the roof might come off.

848
00:51:34,849 --> 00:51:36,077
Go close them.

849
00:51:47,489 --> 00:51:50,401
One thing l can't stand
is a dame that's drunk.

850
00:51:51,129 --> 00:51:53,484
What l mean, they turn my stomach.

851
00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:56,563
No good to themselves
or anybody else.

852
00:51:58,969 --> 00:52:00,288
She got the shakes, see?

853
00:52:00,849 --> 00:52:03,886
So she has a drink to get rid of them.
Then she has another.

854
00:52:04,129 --> 00:52:06,040
First thing you know,
she's stinko again.

855
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,200
You gave me my first drink.

856
00:52:08,449 --> 00:52:10,326
Oh, so it's all my fault now?

857
00:52:10,889 --> 00:52:14,518
Everybody has their first drink,
but everybody ain't a lush!

858
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:17,647
If l'd known you'd act this way,
l wouldn't have come here.

859
00:52:17,889 --> 00:52:20,847
If l'd known what you're like,
you wouldn't have been asked.

860
00:52:22,649 --> 00:52:24,924
Eight years since l seen her.

861
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:31,126
You wouldn't know it's
the same dame.

862
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:35,202
You certainly haven't changed one bit.

863
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:37,163
Meaning what?

864
00:52:37,809 --> 00:52:38,958
Nothing.

865
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:41,885
Gee, you're as mean as can be.

866
00:52:43,049 --> 00:52:45,927
Mean as can be.
Now what does that remind me of?

867
00:52:46,169 --> 00:52:47,079
Don't you remember?

868
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:49,365
That was in a song.
She used to sing it.

869
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:51,281
Yeah, that's right!

870
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:54,277
I gave her her first chance,
made her a singer.

871
00:52:54,529 --> 00:52:57,760
Mention that. Why ain't you
a singing star instead of a lush?

872
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:00,440
Johnny, l didn't mean anything.

873
00:53:00,689 --> 00:53:02,919
Yeah, she could've had a future.

874
00:53:03,169 --> 00:53:04,397
She had everything.

875
00:53:04,609 --> 00:53:05,405
Voice.

876
00:53:05,609 --> 00:53:06,598
Looks.

877
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:07,798
Plenty of class.

878
00:53:08,729 --> 00:53:10,606
I was the rage.

879
00:53:11,209 --> 00:53:12,244
Gee, honey.

880
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:16,686
Now, look, Gaye. . .

881
00:53:17,889 --> 00:53:20,119
. . .why don't you give us your
old song?

882
00:53:22,169 --> 00:53:24,080
You mean, right now?

883
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:29,483
-I can't.
-Sure you can!

884
00:53:29,729 --> 00:53:31,128
Please don't make me.

885
00:53:31,649 --> 00:53:33,879
I won't make you do anything.

886
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:37,240
I got a proposition for you.

887
00:53:37,489 --> 00:53:39,127
Sing a song,
you can have a drink.

888
00:53:43,129 --> 00:53:44,448
Can l have the drink first?

889
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:46,008
No! The song.

890
00:53:46,249 --> 00:53:47,568
Then the drink.

891
00:53:50,609 --> 00:53:52,042
Without any accompaniment?

892
00:53:52,289 --> 00:53:54,678
Now, look, do you want a drink
or don't you?

893
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:00,205
All right.

894
00:54:10,009 --> 00:54:10,805
Well?

895
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:13,685
My gowns were gorgeous.

896
00:54:13,929 --> 00:54:14,759
Always low-cut.

897
00:54:15,009 --> 00:54:16,886
Very dcollet.

898
00:54:17,249 --> 00:54:19,444
I wore hardly any makeup.

899
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,600
Just some lipstick, that's all.

900
00:54:22,089 --> 00:54:25,047
No lights, just a baby spot.

901
00:54:25,649 --> 00:54:29,483
I wouldn't have any entrance.
They'd play the intro in the dark. . .

902
00:54:29,729 --> 00:54:31,481
. . .and a spot would come on. . .

903
00:54:31,729 --> 00:54:32,764
. . .and there l'd be.

904
00:54:44,169 --> 00:54:45,443
Go ahead! Sing!

905
00:54:52,049 --> 00:54:54,609
Moaning low

906
00:54:54,849 --> 00:54:58,683
My sweet man, l love him so

907
00:54:59,489 --> 00:55:03,528
Though he's mean as can be

908
00:55:05,089 --> 00:55:07,842
He's the kind of man

909
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:11,041
Needs the kind of woman

910
00:55:11,649 --> 00:55:13,844
Like me

911
00:55:15,809 --> 00:55:17,686
Gonna die

912
00:55:17,929 --> 00:55:20,966
If sweet man should pass me by

913
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:25,687
If l die, where will he be?

914
00:55:27,049 --> 00:55:29,643
He's the kind of man

915
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:33,728
Needs the kind of woman

916
00:55:34,169 --> 00:55:36,683
Like me

917
00:55:38,729 --> 00:55:40,447
Don 't know any reason

918
00:55:40,689 --> 00:55:42,884
Why he treats me so poorly

919
00:55:44,449 --> 00:55:47,486
What have l gone and done?

920
00:55:49,089 --> 00:55:52,240
Makes my trouble double
With his worries

921
00:55:52,489 --> 00:55:54,127
When surely

922
00:55:55,209 --> 00:55:58,281
I ain 't deserving of none

923
00:56:01,489 --> 00:56:03,605
Moaning low

924
00:56:03,849 --> 00:56:06,682
My sweet man is gonna go

925
00:56:07,529 --> 00:56:11,078
When he goes, oh, Lordy

926
00:56:12,729 --> 00:56:14,765
He's the kind of man

927
00:56:14,969 --> 00:56:17,483
Needs the kind of woman

928
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:20,488
Like me

929
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:25,960
Give me that drink now.

930
00:56:31,009 --> 00:56:33,477
-But you promised!
-So what?

931
00:56:33,729 --> 00:56:36,402
-You said that--
-But you were rotten.

932
00:57:21,049 --> 00:57:22,641
Thanks, fella.

933
00:57:26,969 --> 00:57:28,448
You're welcome.

934
00:57:46,649 --> 00:57:47,923
Play a little gin?

935
00:57:48,449 --> 00:57:49,598
-For how much?
-Name it.

936
00:57:49,849 --> 00:57:51,282
Nickel a point.

937
00:58:12,169 --> 00:58:13,443
Hey, old man.

938
00:58:14,249 --> 00:58:15,762
How bad can it get?

939
00:58:17,209 --> 00:58:19,518
I asked you a question!
Did you hear me?

940
00:58:20,409 --> 00:58:24,197
Worst storm we ever had
was back in '35.

941
00:58:24,409 --> 00:58:26,798
Wind whipped up a big wave
and sent it busting. . .

942
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:29,279
. . .right over Matecumbe Key.

943
00:58:30,449 --> 00:58:33,521
Eight hundred people
were washed out to sea.

944
00:58:34,169 --> 00:58:36,239
How far away was that
from here?

945
00:58:36,489 --> 00:58:38,081
A few miles.

946
00:58:56,209 --> 00:58:57,198
Listen to it.

947
00:59:03,049 --> 00:59:05,005
Sorry about the things
l said upstairs.

948
00:59:05,249 --> 00:59:07,365
They aren't true.
Will you forgive me?

949
00:59:07,609 --> 00:59:08,758
Of course.

950
00:59:09,009 --> 00:59:12,046
He might've killed you,
but you had to help her.

951
00:59:12,289 --> 00:59:15,247
Your head said one way,
but your whole life said another.

952
00:59:15,449 --> 00:59:18,839
The other things, maybe they're true.
Maybe it is a rotten world.

953
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:21,728
But a cause isn't lost if
someone's willing to fight.

954
00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:23,721
I'm not that someone.

955
00:59:25,409 --> 00:59:26,205
But you are.

956
00:59:26,449 --> 00:59:28,758
You may not want to be,
but you can't help yourself.

957
00:59:29,009 --> 00:59:30,567
Your whole life's against you.

958
00:59:30,769 --> 00:59:32,805
What do you know about my life?

959
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:35,723
A whole lot.

960
00:59:35,969 --> 00:59:39,644
From the way you look and talk,
and from things George wrote me.

961
00:59:39,969 --> 00:59:43,245
Most of his last letter was
all about you and him on the phone.

962
00:59:43,489 --> 00:59:46,606
Only he had it the other way.
You were the one on the hill.

963
01:00:34,409 --> 01:00:35,319
What's the matter?

964
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:36,765
Nothing.

965
01:00:40,529 --> 01:00:41,678
Why's everybody so quiet?

966
01:00:43,089 --> 01:00:44,488
Talk, why don't you?

967
01:00:47,129 --> 01:00:48,198
Curly, say something!

968
01:00:48,449 --> 01:00:51,407
-What do you want me to say?
-Anything, just so it's talk.

969
01:00:51,649 --> 01:00:54,482
-Go ahead!
-I'm trying to think.

970
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:58,401
I bet you two or three years,
we get Prohibition back.

971
01:00:59,209 --> 01:01:01,200
This time we make it stick.

972
01:01:02,129 --> 01:01:04,768
I bet you two or three years,
Prohibition comes back.

973
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:06,761
Absolutely, yeah.

974
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:11,243
The trouble was, before,
too many guys wanted to be top dog.

975
01:01:12,129 --> 01:01:13,847
That was the trouble.

976
01:01:14,489 --> 01:01:16,445
One mob gets to
massacring another.

977
01:01:16,849 --> 01:01:18,919
The papers play it up big.
Big, see?

978
01:01:19,169 --> 01:01:21,160
-So what happens?
-So what?

979
01:01:21,489 --> 01:01:23,639
The papers play it up big,
and the public. . .

980
01:01:23,969 --> 01:01:26,199
. . .gets the idea that
Prohibition's no good.

981
01:01:27,089 --> 01:01:28,886
That if they can get rid of it. . . .

982
01:01:29,129 --> 01:01:31,245
-Prohibition, l mean--
-I don't believe it.

983
01:01:31,489 --> 01:01:34,208
Eight hundred guys washed out to sea.
You're a liar!

984
01:01:34,449 --> 01:01:36,201
Nobody would live here
after that!

985
01:01:36,449 --> 01:01:39,282
-Would they?
-I remember reading it in the papers.

986
01:01:39,649 --> 01:01:42,163
A relief train was
dispatched from Miami.

987
01:01:42,569 --> 01:01:45,686
The barometer was down
to about 26 inches. . .

988
01:01:45,929 --> 01:01:48,727
. . .when that train
pulled into Homestead.

989
01:01:48,969 --> 01:01:52,848
Engineer backed his string of empty
coaches into the danger zone. . .

990
01:01:53,089 --> 01:01:55,000
. . .and the hurricane hit.

991
01:01:55,649 --> 01:01:59,085
Knocked those coaches
right off the track.

992
01:01:59,329 --> 01:02:03,083
Two hundred miles an hour,
that wind blew.

993
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:08,724
A tidal wave 1 2 feet high
went right across the Key.

994
01:02:09,009 --> 01:02:10,806
Whole towns were wiped out.

995
01:02:11,049 --> 01:02:13,882
Miles and miles of track
were ripped up. . .

996
01:02:14,129 --> 01:02:16,120
. . .and washed away.
Nothing was left.

997
01:02:16,729 --> 01:02:21,564
More than 500 bodies were
recovered after the storm.

998
01:02:22,129 --> 01:02:23,926
And for months afterwards. . .

999
01:02:24,169 --> 01:02:27,241
. . .corpses were found
in the mangrove swamps.

1000
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:34,285
You don't like it, do you?
The storm?

1001
01:02:35,089 --> 01:02:36,681
Show it your gun, why don't you?

1002
01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:38,323
If it doesn't stop, shoot it.

1003
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:46,365
So the public votes out Prohibition.

1004
01:02:46,649 --> 01:02:48,605
And that's the end of the mobs.

1005
01:02:49,089 --> 01:02:50,442
Next time, it'll be different.

1006
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:53,039
We learned our lesson, all right.

1007
01:02:53,289 --> 01:02:55,598
Next time, the mobs'll get together.

1008
01:02:59,049 --> 01:03:00,402
Make the big wave.

1009
01:03:00,649 --> 01:03:02,605
Send it crashing down on us.

1010
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:05,966
Destroy us all, if need be.
But punish him.

1011
01:03:06,209 --> 01:03:08,040
Shut up, old man!
l'm warning you!

1012
01:03:08,289 --> 01:03:10,120
Hear me. Hear me!

1013
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:11,478
I'll kill you!

1014
01:03:11,689 --> 01:03:12,838
Make a big wave.

1015
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:14,841
Send it against us.
Take us all.

1016
01:03:15,089 --> 01:03:16,727
But destroy him.

1017
01:04:23,409 --> 01:04:24,888
Mr. Temple!

1018
01:04:37,329 --> 01:04:38,648
Mr. Temple!

1019
01:05:29,209 --> 01:05:31,404
The storm's passing.

1020
01:05:32,049 --> 01:05:35,280
A torn shutter or two,
some trash on the beach. . . .

1021
01:05:35,529 --> 01:05:38,805
In a few hours, there'll be little
to remind you of what happened.

1022
01:05:40,329 --> 01:05:42,524
Will we ever see you again?

1023
01:05:42,769 --> 01:05:44,566
The storm.

1024
01:05:45,009 --> 01:05:46,328
It's passing.

1025
01:05:47,089 --> 01:05:49,603
-Will we?
-I hope so.

1026
01:05:49,849 --> 01:05:51,805
Why don't you stay here with us?

1027
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:53,721
You're most welcome.

1028
01:05:53,969 --> 01:05:55,607
Go on, tell him.

1029
01:05:56,009 --> 01:05:59,240
If he decides to stay here with us,
we'd be most happy.

1030
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:01,207
Go on, tell Frank.

1031
01:06:03,289 --> 01:06:04,244
Have you any folks?

1032
01:06:05,689 --> 01:06:08,647
I'd be proud to have you
regard us as your family.

1033
01:06:10,569 --> 01:06:12,161
Maybe that isn't what Frank wants.

1034
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:14,127
I don't mean to set onto you.

1035
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:16,918
Think it over.
Don't give your answer right away.

1036
01:06:17,289 --> 01:06:18,642
Hey, boss! Hey, boss!

1037
01:06:18,889 --> 01:06:21,005
-What's the matter?
-The boat's gone!

1038
01:06:32,009 --> 01:06:33,158
He did it.

1039
01:06:33,569 --> 01:06:35,924
I told him l'd kill him.
He did it just the same.

1040
01:06:36,169 --> 01:06:37,807
Maybe he'll come back.
The storm's over.

1041
01:06:38,049 --> 01:06:38,845
Why not?

1042
01:06:39,089 --> 01:06:40,442
He believed l'd kill him.

1043
01:06:40,689 --> 01:06:41,565
What'll we do?

1044
01:06:41,809 --> 01:06:44,323
-We can't stay here!
-Can we?

1045
01:06:48,169 --> 01:06:48,965
Hey, boss?

1046
01:06:55,489 --> 01:06:56,888
Your mistake, sister.

1047
01:06:57,129 --> 01:06:59,484
-We're not in any trouble.
-Got something?

1048
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:03,559
There's another boat out there.
It ain't much, but it'll get us to Cuba.

1049
01:07:03,809 --> 01:07:05,083
Who's going to run it?

1050
01:07:10,169 --> 01:07:11,284
Him.

1051
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:14,288
Mr. Temple!
You not good man!

1052
01:07:14,529 --> 01:07:15,962
You not let nobody in!
That's no good!

1053
01:07:16,329 --> 01:07:17,284
Tom Osceola.

1054
01:07:17,529 --> 01:07:18,678
-Tom! Tom--
-Shut up!

1055
01:07:18,929 --> 01:07:21,363
You leave women and baby out in storm?
That no good!

1056
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:23,884
You no more friend.
We no do like you say anymore!

1057
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:27,286
No go Ben Wade!
You no good friend to lndian!

1058
01:07:29,449 --> 01:07:30,928
You told me you sent them away.

1059
01:07:31,169 --> 01:07:34,525
You lied to me. They were outside
my door during the whole storm.

1060
01:07:34,769 --> 01:07:36,600
-So what?
-They might've died out there.

1061
01:07:36,849 --> 01:07:38,168
And who cares?

1062
01:07:38,409 --> 01:07:39,842
You filth.

1063
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:42,728
What he said, you can run a boat.
That's a fact?

1064
01:07:43,129 --> 01:07:45,040
His first sweetheart was a boat.

1065
01:07:46,489 --> 01:07:47,842
You're taking us to Cuba.

1066
01:07:48,089 --> 01:07:50,523
-Why should l?
-You know what'll happen if you don't.

1067
01:07:51,969 --> 01:07:53,004
I won't take you.

1068
01:07:53,409 --> 01:07:54,762
You'd rather die than take us?

1069
01:07:55,009 --> 01:07:56,601
I didn't say that.

1070
01:07:57,209 --> 01:07:59,928
You won't kill me.
I'm your only chance of getting away.

1071
01:08:01,009 --> 01:08:03,921
There's other ways of getting
at you. Right, Toots?

1072
01:08:04,209 --> 01:08:05,005
Right.

1073
01:08:05,249 --> 01:08:07,922
-Maybe l'm up to them.
-You wouldn't be.

1074
01:08:08,449 --> 01:08:12,158
After a few minutes of Toots,
you'll begin to ask questions like:

1075
01:08:12,409 --> 01:08:14,161
"What if l come out of this
a cripple?"

1076
01:08:14,769 --> 01:08:19,001
And "Do l care whether they make
their getaway or don't?"

1077
01:08:19,249 --> 01:08:21,046
All your answers
would be right ones.

1078
01:08:21,289 --> 01:08:23,405
-I'm not so sure.
-I am.

1079
01:08:23,929 --> 01:08:25,999
Of course, if you're anxious
to find out. . .

1080
01:08:26,249 --> 01:08:29,321
. . .just how good you are at taking it,
we'll accommodate you.

1081
01:08:29,529 --> 01:08:30,325
But l warn you. . .

1082
01:08:31,169 --> 01:08:32,648
. . .Toots hasn't had much practice.

1083
01:08:32,889 --> 01:08:34,561
Kind of rusty.
Might slip.

1084
01:08:34,929 --> 01:08:36,647
And that would be too bad.

1085
01:08:37,129 --> 01:08:40,280
Because you made real sense
upstairs when you said. . .

1086
01:08:40,529 --> 01:08:43,566
. . .one Rocco more or less
ain't worth dying for.

1087
01:08:46,249 --> 01:08:47,523
Ziggy!

1088
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:57,243
The law!

1089
01:08:58,249 --> 01:09:00,399
One wrong word out of anybody
and he gets it. . .

1090
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:01,923
. . .the same as Sawyer did.

1091
01:09:02,649 --> 01:09:04,640
Understand me, old man?

1092
01:09:08,609 --> 01:09:10,565
Now, you, sister, let him in.

1093
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:23,518
Good evening.

1094
01:09:23,769 --> 01:09:26,124
I'm looking for Sawyer.
Is he here?

1095
01:09:27,529 --> 01:09:29,008
Has he been here?

1096
01:09:30,169 --> 01:09:33,081
That's funny. He put a call
into me from here about 7:00.

1097
01:09:33,329 --> 01:09:34,842
Did he?

1098
01:09:35,769 --> 01:09:36,565
Good evening.

1099
01:09:36,809 --> 01:09:37,719
Folks.

1100
01:09:37,969 --> 01:09:39,687
Pretty good blow.

1101
01:09:40,569 --> 01:09:42,287
Did some damage, l see.

1102
01:09:42,529 --> 01:09:44,485
Power lines are down
in a couple of places.

1103
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:46,879
-How's the road?
-Passable.

1104
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:48,598
I'm trying to locate Sawyer.

1105
01:09:49,049 --> 01:09:50,482
Seen him, anybody?

1106
01:09:58,849 --> 01:10:00,567
Have you seen Sawyer?

1107
01:10:02,689 --> 01:10:05,328
He was here. I know
because he called me from here.

1108
01:10:05,689 --> 01:10:06,917
About 7:00.

1109
01:10:07,569 --> 01:10:09,241
I called back
a few minutes later.

1110
01:10:09,489 --> 01:10:12,322
Somebody answered.
Was it one of you?

1111
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:14,328
I did.

1112
01:10:14,529 --> 01:10:15,325
Oh, you?

1113
01:10:16,449 --> 01:10:18,599
I came down from upstairs
when you called.

1114
01:10:18,849 --> 01:10:20,601
Nobody was around,
so l answered.

1115
01:10:21,729 --> 01:10:23,447
Probably he stopped in to call.

1116
01:10:23,689 --> 01:10:26,078
Then he went on and got caught
in the storm.

1117
01:10:26,329 --> 01:10:28,684
He's stalled along the road
right now, probably.

1118
01:10:28,929 --> 01:10:31,238
He ain't between here
and Palm Grove.

1119
01:10:31,489 --> 01:10:34,128
And he wouldn't have called me
unless it was special.

1120
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:36,087
Seen the Osceola brothers?

1121
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:38,837
Have you?

1122
01:10:39,729 --> 01:10:42,527
I figured that was what it was about.
His call, l mean.

1123
01:10:42,769 --> 01:10:44,441
The Osceola brothers.

1124
01:10:44,689 --> 01:10:47,840
Couple of lndians busted out of jail,
and we're looking for them.

1125
01:10:48,209 --> 01:10:50,245
I'll take a run down Matecumbe Way.

1126
01:10:50,489 --> 01:10:53,162
If Sawyer shows up, tell him
to wait. I'll be back.

1127
01:10:53,409 --> 01:10:54,888
See you later.

1128
01:10:59,249 --> 01:11:00,921
First visit to the Keys, Mr. . .?

1129
01:11:01,169 --> 01:11:02,318
Brown.

1130
01:11:02,849 --> 01:11:05,966
Late in the season for a storm.
They usually hit early summer.

1131
01:11:06,209 --> 01:11:09,360
-Is that so?
-Been doing any fishing?

1132
01:11:09,609 --> 01:11:11,725
There's no better fishing
than on the Keys.

1133
01:11:11,969 --> 01:11:13,448
See you later.

1134
01:12:12,769 --> 01:12:13,963
It's him!

1135
01:12:14,209 --> 01:12:15,324
Sawyer!

1136
01:12:15,769 --> 01:12:16,758
He's murdered!

1137
01:12:17,009 --> 01:12:19,443
I didn't wanna say anything.
It's not my business.

1138
01:12:19,689 --> 01:12:22,408
But those lndians you were
talking about, they were here.

1139
01:12:22,649 --> 01:12:23,559
The Osceolas?

1140
01:12:23,809 --> 01:12:27,563
They were here during the storm.
They left a couple of minutes ago.

1141
01:12:56,569 --> 01:12:57,763
Stop!

1142
01:12:58,129 --> 01:12:59,642
Stop or l'll shoot!

1143
01:13:03,409 --> 01:13:05,718
Watch yourselves.
Stay in line.

1144
01:13:24,289 --> 01:13:25,085
He's dead!

1145
01:13:26,009 --> 01:13:28,398
Your lndians murdered Sawyer!

1146
01:13:29,089 --> 01:13:30,761
You lied to me.

1147
01:13:31,009 --> 01:13:33,398
You said you hadn't
seen the Osceolas. You lied.

1148
01:13:34,249 --> 01:13:37,639
Sawyer was here. He called
because he'd found the Osceolas.

1149
01:13:37,889 --> 01:13:39,959
They tried to hide it
by sinking his body. . .

1150
01:13:40,209 --> 01:13:42,598
. . .but the storm tore his body loose
and threw it up!

1151
01:13:42,849 --> 01:13:44,646
Right at your door!

1152
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,438
And that's where the crime belongs,
at your door.

1153
01:13:48,249 --> 01:13:51,878
You probably knew they killed Sawyer.
I wouldn't put it past you!

1154
01:13:52,129 --> 01:13:55,246
And l'm gonna lay charges
naming you as accessory.

1155
01:13:55,449 --> 01:13:56,768
What was the shooting?

1156
01:13:57,009 --> 01:13:58,488
The Osceolas tried to get away.

1157
01:13:59,169 --> 01:14:00,887
I killed them both.

1158
01:14:16,209 --> 01:14:18,359
Brown, what's your first name?

1159
01:14:18,609 --> 01:14:19,439
Howard.

1160
01:14:22,169 --> 01:14:22,965
Address?

1161
01:14:24,249 --> 01:14:26,001
Hotel Central, Milwaukee.

1162
01:14:27,889 --> 01:14:30,323
-How long you gonna be here?
-A week.

1163
01:14:33,209 --> 01:14:35,598
Haven't l seen you
someplace before?

1164
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:37,162
I don't think so.

1165
01:14:38,169 --> 01:14:39,318
You.

1166
01:14:40,449 --> 01:14:42,838
Hoff. Richard.

1167
01:14:44,129 --> 01:14:46,324
Hotel Central, Milwaukee.

1168
01:14:47,129 --> 01:14:48,721
We're all together.

1169
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:50,922
Your full name.

1170
01:14:51,289 --> 01:14:53,598
Frank McCloud.
No address.

1171
01:14:54,129 --> 01:14:55,482
What are you doing here?

1172
01:14:55,729 --> 01:14:57,287
Passing through.

1173
01:14:59,409 --> 01:15:00,205
You.

1174
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:03,448
Bass. Edward Bass.
Hotel Central, Milwaukee.

1175
01:15:03,689 --> 01:15:05,202
We're all together.

1176
01:15:10,329 --> 01:15:12,206
How far to Key West?

1177
01:15:13,489 --> 01:15:15,207
How far to Key West?

1178
01:15:16,009 --> 01:15:17,237
About 1 00 miles.

1179
01:15:17,569 --> 01:15:18,718
Some hurricane.

1180
01:15:18,969 --> 01:15:21,403
Thought it would blow us
right out into the ocean.

1181
01:15:21,649 --> 01:15:24,846
Had to pull up on the road for
a couple of hours till it blew over.

1182
01:15:25,089 --> 01:15:26,647
That's some hurricane.

1183
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:28,641
I'll be back in the morning.

1184
01:15:30,009 --> 01:15:31,681
Can we get something to eat?

1185
01:15:32,409 --> 01:15:33,558
Can we?

1186
01:15:54,129 --> 01:15:55,721
In there, everybody.

1187
01:16:14,329 --> 01:16:15,808
Hi, Ziggy!

1188
01:16:16,049 --> 01:16:18,404
Johnny-boy! How are you?

1189
01:16:19,569 --> 01:16:21,082
What do you know?

1190
01:16:21,489 --> 01:16:23,207
You're a sight for sore eyes!

1191
01:16:23,409 --> 01:16:24,205
Come on in.

1192
01:16:25,689 --> 01:16:27,839
Hey, boys!
Ziggy!

1193
01:16:28,489 --> 01:16:30,605
It's sure great
to see you again, pal.

1194
01:16:30,849 --> 01:16:32,840
Well, it sure is swell.

1195
01:16:35,529 --> 01:16:37,406
You put on a little weight.

1196
01:16:37,929 --> 01:16:38,725
Now wait a minute.

1197
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:41,324
-Look who's talking!
-Oh, look out!

1198
01:16:43,289 --> 01:16:44,802
Say, guess who's here.

1199
01:16:45,049 --> 01:16:46,038
Who?

1200
01:16:47,649 --> 01:16:48,638
Gaye, where are you?

1201
01:16:48,889 --> 01:16:50,641
Gaye Dawn!
Don't tell me!

1202
01:16:53,289 --> 01:16:54,927
Well, l'll be--

1203
01:16:55,169 --> 01:16:58,639
Say, she's as pretty as ever.

1204
01:17:01,009 --> 01:17:03,682
Where you been all the time
Johnny was away?

1205
01:17:04,409 --> 01:17:05,478
Around.

1206
01:17:05,729 --> 01:17:08,846
If l'd have known that, l'd have
tried to beat Johnny's time.

1207
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:10,841
Same old Ziggy!

1208
01:17:11,409 --> 01:17:12,888
All right, baby.

1209
01:17:15,209 --> 01:17:17,279
I know you fellas
are in a hurry, huh?

1210
01:17:33,209 --> 01:17:34,244
Lou!

1211
01:17:39,929 --> 01:17:41,567
Paper has a good feel.

1212
01:17:57,449 --> 01:17:59,280
Lathe work's okay.

1213
01:18:00,129 --> 01:18:02,643
Portrait's good.
No breaks in the lines.

1214
01:18:02,889 --> 01:18:04,208
Serial numbers check out?

1215
01:18:04,409 --> 01:18:05,762
Yeah, naturally.

1216
01:18:12,969 --> 01:18:14,687
Back color's okay.

1217
01:18:16,889 --> 01:18:18,641
High-class merchandise.

1218
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:43,124
Hey, fella, what are you gonna do?

1219
01:18:44,809 --> 01:18:45,878
Don't go with them.

1220
01:18:46,129 --> 01:18:48,597
They'd wait till you get them
to Cuba, then kill you.

1221
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:50,840
You'd never walk off that boat.

1222
01:18:51,729 --> 01:18:54,243
She's right. Tell them you'll go,
or they'll hurt you.

1223
01:18:54,489 --> 01:18:57,481
Then when you get outside, run.
Try to get away.

1224
01:18:57,729 --> 01:18:59,606
It's your only chance, fella.

1225
01:19:00,889 --> 01:19:02,641
Frank, what are you thinking?

1226
01:19:04,409 --> 01:19:05,683
You were right.

1227
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:08,479
Your head says one thing. . .

1228
01:19:08,729 --> 01:19:10,606
. . .and your whole life says another.

1229
01:19:11,089 --> 01:19:12,886
Your head always loses.

1230
01:19:13,969 --> 01:19:16,529
Out there in the dark,
make a break for it.

1231
01:19:16,769 --> 01:19:18,043
Run, fella!

1232
01:19:18,529 --> 01:19:21,089
Yeah, that's what my head says.

1233
01:19:21,329 --> 01:19:22,967
You gonna make a fight of it?

1234
01:19:23,209 --> 01:19:24,722
I've got to.

1235
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:28,598
Not that one Rocco more or less makes
any difference in this world.

1236
01:19:28,849 --> 01:19:30,646
What l said upstairs still goes.

1237
01:19:30,889 --> 01:19:32,720
I haven't changed my tune.

1238
01:19:33,049 --> 01:19:34,243
It's just that. . .

1239
01:19:35,409 --> 01:19:36,558
. . .I've got to.

1240
01:19:36,809 --> 01:19:40,404
Well, if you're a fighter,
you can't walk away from a fight.

1241
01:19:40,649 --> 01:19:42,560
That's the answer, l guess.

1242
01:19:45,689 --> 01:19:46,963
Here you are, Curly.

1243
01:19:47,609 --> 01:19:49,361
Well, Johnny, pal. . .

1244
01:19:49,609 --> 01:19:50,883
. . .when are you coming back again?

1245
01:19:51,129 --> 01:19:52,039
It won't be long now.

1246
01:19:52,289 --> 01:19:55,486
With you back again,
it'll be like old times.

1247
01:19:59,409 --> 01:20:00,762
You know something?

1248
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:04,240
I bet inside of two years
we have Prohibition back again.

1249
01:20:04,449 --> 01:20:07,839
Only this time, it'll be different.
The mobs will be together.

1250
01:20:08,049 --> 01:20:10,882
-No more blasting each other!
-You said it!

1251
01:20:13,409 --> 01:20:14,524
So long, Johnny.

1252
01:20:14,769 --> 01:20:15,679
So long, Ziggy.

1253
01:20:15,889 --> 01:20:17,242
See you when!

1254
01:20:30,529 --> 01:20:31,484
Let's get started.

1255
01:20:31,729 --> 01:20:34,448
Bring everything down.
The soldier's stuff too.

1256
01:20:34,689 --> 01:20:35,838
Soldier?

1257
01:20:36,049 --> 01:20:37,767
Give Ralph a hand.

1258
01:20:38,609 --> 01:20:39,724
Coming with us?

1259
01:20:39,969 --> 01:20:41,561
Yes or no? l'm in a hurry.

1260
01:20:42,409 --> 01:20:44,240
Toots, go to work on him.

1261
01:20:46,769 --> 01:20:47,599
You win.

1262
01:20:47,889 --> 01:20:49,959
I thought you'd change your mind.

1263
01:20:51,489 --> 01:20:53,605
What's the damage, old man?

1264
01:20:54,609 --> 01:20:56,520
That ought to take care of it.

1265
01:20:57,769 --> 01:20:59,521
Want to come along, sister?

1266
01:21:24,169 --> 01:21:25,568
Okay, boys.

1267
01:21:36,329 --> 01:21:37,648
Give me.

1268
01:21:43,529 --> 01:21:44,518
Where are my things?

1269
01:21:44,769 --> 01:21:46,964
I forgot to tell you.
You're not coming.

1270
01:21:47,529 --> 01:21:49,565
On this, you can
stay drunk for a month.

1271
01:21:49,809 --> 01:21:51,879
-Please take me with you.
-Get away!

1272
01:21:52,129 --> 01:21:54,597
You got to, Johnny.
You got to! Please!

1273
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:57,323
I'll stop drinking.
I'll do anything.

1274
01:21:57,569 --> 01:21:59,287
Please! l love you!
l need you!

1275
01:21:59,529 --> 01:22:00,882
I'll kill myself!

1276
01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:03,086
Johnny, please! Please!

1277
01:22:03,329 --> 01:22:05,684
I'll be good to you,
like l was before.

1278
01:22:05,929 --> 01:22:09,808
I won't let you go without me!
You've got to take me with you!

1279
01:22:11,289 --> 01:22:12,642
Come on, soldier!

1280
01:22:19,729 --> 01:22:21,321
Get going, soldier.

1281
01:22:25,729 --> 01:22:27,526
Good luck, son!

1282
01:22:27,729 --> 01:22:29,401
Yeah. Good luck.

1283
01:22:48,409 --> 01:22:49,842
Why doesn't he run?

1284
01:22:50,489 --> 01:22:51,638
Run, fella, run!

1285
01:22:54,689 --> 01:22:55,724
Why doesn't he run?

1286
01:23:47,129 --> 01:23:48,562
Will you cast off that bowline?

1287
01:23:49,689 --> 01:23:51,566
Stand by that stern line.

1288
01:24:00,529 --> 01:24:02,326
Okay, let her go.

1289
01:24:35,569 --> 01:24:37,924
That was his only chance.

1290
01:24:38,209 --> 01:24:39,927
He didn't take it.

1291
01:24:40,569 --> 01:24:42,446
He should've run.

1292
01:24:48,929 --> 01:24:50,726
The lines are dead.

1293
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:21,444
How we doing?

1294
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:23,407
We're right on course.

1295
01:25:23,809 --> 01:25:25,527
Well, keep us that way.

1296
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:35,967
How you feeling, Toots?

1297
01:25:36,889 --> 01:25:37,924
I feel awful.

1298
01:25:38,169 --> 01:25:39,602
Why don't you go downstairs?

1299
01:25:39,849 --> 01:25:41,043
It's too hot down there.

1300
01:25:42,769 --> 01:25:44,088
What time is it?

1301
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:47,248
A little after 4.

1302
01:25:47,489 --> 01:25:49,081
We're not halfway there yet.

1303
01:25:49,329 --> 01:25:51,797
-Johnny's sleeping?
-Yeah.

1304
01:26:14,649 --> 01:26:16,241
Dog, Unit, Man, Roger.

1305
01:26:16,449 --> 01:26:18,519
Numeral 0-2-2-4...

1306
01:26:18,769 --> 01:26:20,680
... 0-0-Z.

1307
01:26:20,929 --> 01:26:22,647
Man, Roger, X-ray, George.

1308
01:26:22,889 --> 01:26:25,403
Group numerals 4-5.
Missing fishing boat...

1309
01:26:25,609 --> 01:26:27,964
. . .Santana is being taken to Cuba.

1310
01:26:28,329 --> 01:26:32,038
X-ray. Sea search of area B
immediately. X-ray.

1311
01:26:32,249 --> 01:26:34,558
Is us they are talking about
on the radio?

1312
01:26:34,809 --> 01:26:35,844
Let them.

1313
01:26:36,569 --> 01:26:39,322
In a fog like this,
they couldn't find the Queen Mary.

1314
01:26:40,769 --> 01:26:41,884
Hey, Curly!

1315
01:26:44,849 --> 01:26:46,407
What time is it?

1316
01:26:46,809 --> 01:26:48,640
A little after 4.

1317
01:26:50,329 --> 01:26:51,478
Say, Johnny.

1318
01:26:51,729 --> 01:26:53,242
I've been thinking.

1319
01:26:54,449 --> 01:26:56,644
-About Gaye.
-What about her?

1320
01:26:56,889 --> 01:26:59,528
Do you think it was such a good idea
not to bring her?

1321
01:26:59,769 --> 01:27:00,838
She's pretty sore.

1322
01:27:01,089 --> 01:27:02,761
So she's sore.

1323
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:04,886
Yeah, but she might squeal.

1324
01:27:05,529 --> 01:27:06,848
Just for spite.

1325
01:27:07,089 --> 01:27:08,920
On Ziggy, l mean.

1326
01:27:10,689 --> 01:27:11,519
Well?

1327
01:27:15,529 --> 01:27:17,440
I get it.

1328
01:27:17,689 --> 01:27:20,123
There's only one Johnny.

1329
01:27:46,689 --> 01:27:47,804
Hey, you!

1330
01:27:48,569 --> 01:27:51,481
Look over the stern.
See if we picked up any kelp.

1331
01:28:00,489 --> 01:28:01,808
I feel awful.

1332
01:28:12,649 --> 01:28:14,685
Toots! Help!

1333
01:28:50,849 --> 01:28:52,123
What's the matter?

1334
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:03,799
My gun. It's gone!

1335
01:29:05,169 --> 01:29:06,318
Gaye!

1336
01:29:14,049 --> 01:29:15,038
Toots!

1337
01:29:16,169 --> 01:29:17,238
Ralph!

1338
01:29:19,289 --> 01:29:20,722
Soldier!

1339
01:29:20,969 --> 01:29:21,765
Hey there, soldier!

1340
01:29:34,329 --> 01:29:36,126
Angel, you go up.

1341
01:29:36,529 --> 01:29:38,008
Go on! Do you hear me?

1342
01:29:38,729 --> 01:29:39,684
I get killed.

1343
01:29:39,889 --> 01:29:41,880
You gonna go up there?
Are you?

1344
01:29:42,329 --> 01:29:44,843
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Toots killed him.

1345
01:29:45,089 --> 01:29:46,442
Then you go, John--

1346
01:29:54,649 --> 01:29:55,638
Soldier!

1347
01:29:56,009 --> 01:29:56,805
Listen to me.

1348
01:29:57,889 --> 01:29:59,322
Angel and Curly are dead.

1349
01:29:59,569 --> 01:30:01,082
There's just me and you.

1350
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:03,645
We'll be partners.
Everything will be 50-50.

1351
01:30:03,889 --> 01:30:05,242
What do you say?

1352
01:30:06,009 --> 01:30:07,488
Can you hear me?

1353
01:30:08,129 --> 01:30:09,801
What do you say? ls it a deal?

1354
01:30:13,529 --> 01:30:15,087
I know what you're thinking.

1355
01:30:15,329 --> 01:30:17,684
You'll get rid of me and take all
the money, is that it?

1356
01:30:18,009 --> 01:30:19,203
Is it?

1357
01:30:19,449 --> 01:30:20,484
Answer me!

1358
01:30:23,849 --> 01:30:25,282
I'll tell you what.

1359
01:30:26,409 --> 01:30:28,320
Suppose l say the money is yours.

1360
01:30:33,289 --> 01:30:34,165
Here, look!

1361
01:30:36,769 --> 01:30:37,963
It's yours.

1362
01:30:38,209 --> 01:30:39,483
All yours, soldier!

1363
01:30:39,689 --> 01:30:41,486
Plenty more when we get to Cuba.

1364
01:30:42,689 --> 01:30:44,008
Okay, soldier?

1365
01:30:45,009 --> 01:30:46,237
You hear me?

1366
01:30:46,489 --> 01:30:47,922
I'll make you rich!

1367
01:30:50,409 --> 01:30:51,398
Soldier!

1368
01:30:55,449 --> 01:30:57,963
You're not big enough
to do this to Rocco. I'll kill you!

1369
01:30:58,209 --> 01:31:00,245
You'll never bring me in.
Never!

1370
01:31:03,209 --> 01:31:05,769
Look, soldier, l know what it is.

1371
01:31:06,729 --> 01:31:08,845
You figure l got a gun,
so you can't trust me.

1372
01:31:09,049 --> 01:31:09,845
Right?

1373
01:31:18,649 --> 01:31:19,843
Look!

1374
01:31:20,569 --> 01:31:21,638
See?

1375
01:31:22,009 --> 01:31:23,442
I'm leveling with you.

1376
01:31:24,089 --> 01:31:25,568
Okay, soldier?

1377
01:31:26,609 --> 01:31:28,167
I'm coming out.

1378
01:31:29,209 --> 01:31:30,688
Okay, soldier?

1379
01:31:32,129 --> 01:31:34,006
I got no gun. . .

1380
01:31:34,249 --> 01:31:36,080
. . .and l'm coming out.

1381
01:31:37,289 --> 01:31:38,608
Soldier!

1382
01:33:07,409 --> 01:33:09,479
Mayday. Mayday.

1383
01:33:13,729 --> 01:33:14,844
Calling Nan, Mike, Abel.

1384
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:17,205
Calling Nan, Mike, Abel.

1385
01:33:17,449 --> 01:33:19,644
This is Abel, Sugar, Abel, Nan.

1386
01:33:19,889 --> 01:33:22,687
Calling Nan, Mike, Abel.

1387
01:33:22,929 --> 01:33:24,408
Come in, please.

1388
01:33:24,649 --> 01:33:27,800
This is Nan, Mike, Abel.
Go ahead.

1389
01:33:28,689 --> 01:33:30,805
This is Abel, Sugar, Abel, Nan.

1390
01:33:31,209 --> 01:33:32,881
The Santana.

1391
01:33:33,169 --> 01:33:35,478
My name is Frank McCloud.

1392
01:33:35,729 --> 01:33:39,642
I'm about 1 2 miles off
Boot Key Harbor, on my way in.

1393
01:33:39,889 --> 01:33:40,844
Over.

1394
01:33:41,089 --> 01:33:43,922
Are you all right?
Are you all right? Over.

1395
01:33:44,569 --> 01:33:48,005
Yes, but l need medical attention.
Over.

1396
01:33:48,929 --> 01:33:50,203
Continue on course.

1397
01:33:50,409 --> 01:33:52,320
Stand by on this frequency.

1398
01:33:52,769 --> 01:33:54,327
I'm standing by.

1399
01:33:55,449 --> 01:33:57,201
Will you put me through to. . .

1400
01:33:57,729 --> 01:33:59,447
. . .the Largo Hotel?

1401
01:33:59,689 --> 01:34:00,405
Stand by.

1402
01:34:03,009 --> 01:34:06,684
State police picked up Ziggy and
his men crossing into Georgia.

1403
01:34:06,929 --> 01:34:09,397
You'll have to go up
and identify him, miss.

1404
01:34:12,169 --> 01:34:16,606
Mr. Temple, l'm mighty grateful to you
for saving my life and all. . .

1405
01:34:16,849 --> 01:34:19,409
. . .but those two boys, the Osceolas. . . .

1406
01:34:19,929 --> 01:34:23,046
I'd rather been killed than have
innocent blood on my hands.

1407
01:34:23,249 --> 01:34:24,762
I'm the one to blame.

1408
01:34:25,249 --> 01:34:27,763
If they hadn't trusted me,
they wouldn't have come here. . .

1409
01:34:27,969 --> 01:34:29,721
. . .and they'd still be alive.

1410
01:34:29,929 --> 01:34:32,568
We can't do anything but harm
to those people. . .

1411
01:34:32,769 --> 01:34:34,441
. . .even when we go to help them.

1412
01:34:34,769 --> 01:34:36,999
No, Mr. Temple, it wasn't you.

1413
01:34:37,249 --> 01:34:39,205
It wasn't the law or anybody.

1414
01:34:39,449 --> 01:34:41,041
It was only Johnny Rocco.

1415
01:34:41,289 --> 01:34:44,520
Nobody in the whole world is safe
as long as he's alive.

1416
01:34:46,689 --> 01:34:48,327
We better go, miss.

1417
01:35:06,169 --> 01:35:07,807
Hotel Largo.

1418
01:35:09,729 --> 01:35:10,957
Frank!

1419
01:35:18,049 --> 01:35:19,448
Oh, thank God!

1420
01:35:41,449 --> 01:35:43,804
He's all right, Dad.
He's coming back to us.
