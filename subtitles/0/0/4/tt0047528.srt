1
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,492
You must go home! Mama said that 
you should come home immediately!

2
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,773
There is a man, with a 
big, big motorcycle!

3
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,131
He said Rosa is dead.

4
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,058
Gelsomina! You know Zampano,
Rosa's husband?

5
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,011
My poor daughter! She died far from 
home. I'll never see her grave!

6
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,177
She is dead, the poor thing!
She was so beautiful, worked so hard!

7
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,019
She could do everything!

8
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,615
Look at her, Zampano,
she looks like Rosa.

9
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,610
This is Gelsomina.
How miserable we are!

10
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,091
Of course, Zampano,

11
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,535
she isn't Rosa, but she's of 
good nature and disciplined,

12
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,090
just a little bit strange,

13
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,770
but if she gets food every 
day, she'll get better.

14
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,212
Do you want to go with Zampano
and take Rosa's place?

15
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,969
You can learn something, 
earn money,

16
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,651
and we'd have one hungry 
soul less to feed.

17
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,490
Zampano is a kind man,
he'll be good to you.

18
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,409
You will see the world, 
learn to sing and dance,

19
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,216
and look what he did:
He gave me 10.000 Lire!

20
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:38,656
We could repair the roof and 
buy some food again...

21
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,733
Why did your father have to 
leave us so early...

22
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,458
You've already grown
but never worked.

23
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,415
It's not your fault, that you're 
not like the other girls.

24
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,729
Don't you want to help your mother?
Zampano, will she learn something?

25
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,899
Sure, I can teach things 
even to a dog!

26
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,492
All right,

27
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,413
buy salami, 1/2 cheese

28
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,455
and two bottles of wine.

29
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,696
- That's how I am.
- Thank him, children.

30
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,892
Where are you going?
Come here!

31
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,975
What are you doing?

32
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,251
- You'll go away, Gelsomina?
- I'll work, learn something

33
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,657
and send some money home.
I'll become an artist,

34
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,215
will dance and sing like Rosa...

35
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,493
- And, when you'll return?
- When she'll return?

36
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,736
Don't go away!

37
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,250
My dear child! Stay with me!

38
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,375
We'll be back soon!

39
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,169
Departure!

40
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,498
Your things, Gelsomina!
Your scarf!

41
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,498
Get in!

42
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,052
My daughter!

43
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,453
My poor daughter!

44
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,015
This chain is 0.5 cm thick,

45
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,018
pure iron, stronger then steel!

46
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,371
With a simple expansion of 
the chest muscles...

47
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,458
I'll blow up the hook!

48
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,459
Thanks.

49
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,096
For that I have to blow up 
my lungs like a hose!

50
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,815
There is a danger that a vein 
bursts and I spit blood!

51
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,011
Once in Milan,

52
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,340
a 70 kg man lost his eyesight, 
when he tried it.

53
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,896
The eyeballs have to 
stand the pressure!

54
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,615
And when the eyesight is 
lost, then it's over!

55
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,859
Those, who have weak nerves, 
should better look away.

56
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,970
It could bleed!

57
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,930
You never used to cook 
at home, didn't you?

58
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,091
What a rank shit!

59
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,251
Here are enough clothes for ten 
people. Shoes, dresses, anything.

60
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,497
Come here, maybe some of 
them will suit you right.

61
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,452
You have to look exquisite. You don't 
travel with Zampano in rags.

62
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,413
My ladies always looked tasteful!

63
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,892
Now say: "Here comes Zampano!"

64
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,971
Here comes Zampano.

65
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,534
Here comes Zampano.

66
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,571
Here comes Zampano.

67
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,251
Come here!

68
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,498
That's a trumpet.

69
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,656
You do only, what I tell you.

70
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,415
This is a tambour.

71
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,929
Here comes Zampano!

72
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,056
Here comes Zampano.

73
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,579
Here comes Zampano!

74
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,133
Zampano is here.

75
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,299
Once again!

76
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,335
Here comes Zampano.

77
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,693
Come here.

78
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,619
Here.

79
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,539
Again!

80
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,138
Zampano is here!

81
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,653
That's how you have to say it:

82
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,659
Here comes Zampano!

83
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,369
Come on!

84
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,695
Here comes Zampano...

85
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,817
Fire which burns, sparks in heaven,
night without an end... Booh, booh...

86
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,499
What are you doing?

87
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,336
It'll rain in two days.

88
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,939
- How do you know?
- It'll rain!

89
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,329
Come here.

90
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,539
Get in.

91
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,771
- I'll sleep outside.
- Oh really?

92
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,212
Now listen:

93
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,529
- What's your name?
- Di Costanzo Gelsomina.

94
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,650
Come on, Gelsomina, move.

95
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,932
- Tomorrow.
- Come on, get in!

96
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,133
Thank You.

97
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,773
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time in this city,

98
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,370
a new posse, about which you 
can laugh from the heart!

99
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,616
Enjoy it!

100
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,456
Those, who have a weak 
heart shouldn't watch,

101
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,571
they could die from laughter!

102
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,977
And because not even the greatest 
artist can live with air only,

103
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,013
my wife will reach the 
hat around afterwards.

104
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,132
Go, go!

105
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,692
Quickly!

106
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,893
Good day, Signorina Gelsomina!

107
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,977
Zampano!

108
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:27,174
Pardon my question, aren't You 
afraid of my "Rufle"?

109
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,936
I said, aren't You afraid 
of my "Rufle"?!

110
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,691
All right, then we'll go and 
hunt some with my "Rufle".

111
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,179
Ha-ha-ha, that's not a "Rufle",
that's a "Rifle"! Dummy!

112
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,614
Where are the ducks?

113
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:05,130
If here are no ducks, you're 
the duck and I am the hunter!

114
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,450
No! That's a donkey, not a duck!

115
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,334
Thank You!

116
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,339
My wife asks you now 
for a small donation.

117
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,056
Whoever gives something and those, who can't 
afford anything, all are appreciated.


118
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,493
- Good evening.
- Close the door!

119
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,970
- What's up, fatso?
- Hi, Zampano.

120
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,049
- Hey, Zingaro, you're here too?
- Zampano, how is it goin'?

121
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,978
That's my wife.

122
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,809
wife? A new girlfriend,
I'm glad to hear.

123
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,092
- Sit down.
- It's fine, we'll sit there.

124
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,652
Waiter!

125
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,099
- Should I leave?
- No, stay here!

126
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,054
- Waiter!
- I'm coming.

127
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,699
Give us some food.

128
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,935
Lamb roast and ragout are 
ready to be served.

129
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,537
What would you have?

130
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,411
- This.
- Lamb or ragout?

131
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,373
Both of them.

132
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,298
- Both?
- Yes, both.

133
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,936
- Lamb roast with noodles for me.
- All right.

134
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,650
And one litre of red wine.

135
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,019
- Where are you from?
- From my home village.

136
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,860
You speak different from the people 
here. Where were you born?

137
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,931
In my father's home.

138
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,257
Waiter, one more bottle!

139
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,496
That supposed to be wool? It's wadding!
It'll hang between the toes!

140
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,491
Hey, redhead! Come here!

141
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,538
- You're talking to me?
- Yea, come here!

142
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,533
Good evening.

143
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,571
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

144
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,657
Sit down there.

145
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,655
- You want something to drink?
- Gladly.

146
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,570
- Wine, but fast!
- This restaurant doesn't please me at all.

147
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,372
A cigarette?

148
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,420
- I know you from somewhere.
- It's possible, I have been around.

149
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,855
Here, the wine.

150
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,699
- Have you already eaten?
- Yes.

151
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,178
Here to you!

152
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,853
Where have I seen you?
What do you work?

153
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,051
I'm a travelling artist.

154
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,099
She's my assistant.
I taught her everything,

155
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,655
She couldn't even say 
"I-A" on her own!

156
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,540
Here, feel it.

157
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,690
What a nasty guy you are!

158
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,812
Here, look at this.

159
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,416
Earned all of it within 
an hour with those.

160
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,576
May I?

161
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,334
She's a real brand!

162
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,494
Let's go outside, it stinks here!

163
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,339
- Let's watch the fireworks.
- Let's go then.

164
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,213
Waiter, two more bottles!

165
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,689
- What do you get?
- 4.200 with these two.

166
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,536
Still here at this time?

167
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,138
- How's the business?
- It's okay.

168
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,169
Put the bottles in the wagon.

169
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,375
Redhead, where do you go?

170
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,813
- Get in!
- Is this your car?

171
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,492
- Are you crazy?
- That's an American,

172
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,851
never failed in seven years!

173
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,657
- Oh my God, what are you doing?
- Do you hear, what motor it is?

174
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,778
- Should I enter in the back?
- You wait here.

175
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,016
Where do you go?

176
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,209
Still here?

177
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,131
Why you don't eat the soup?

178
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,329
Why she doesn't eat?

179
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,690
She doesn't want to, something 
is wrong with her.

180
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,334
No, I won't eat my soup!

181
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,054
Do you see? Ingratitude 
is the world's wage.

182
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:42,812
Is that not your husband
with that strange car?

183
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,859
That's surely him.

184
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,291
His vehicle is near the sand pits.

185
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,458
- Where?
- Where the city ends.

186
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,288
You have to climb over.

187
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,816
Are You awake?

188
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,855
I sowed some tomatoes.

189
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,019
Tomatoes!

190
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:12,899
I found some real tomato seeds
and put them into earth.

191
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,817
Get in, let's go!

192
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:26,098
- We move along?
- You want to wait for the tomatoes to grow?!

193
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,972
Go and push.

194
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,937
You did it the same way with Rosa?

195
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,459
What?

196
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,577
With Rosa.

197
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,416
What are you talking about?

198
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,130
Why You left with that woman?

199
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,253
- You did it the same way with Rosa?
- Stop it!

200
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,614
What do you want?

201
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,778
So You go with other women?

202
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,209
What?

203
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,729
You go with other women?

204
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,615
If you want to stay with me, you'll
need to learn one thing before all:

205
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,334
to shut your mouth!

206
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,178
Tomatoes!

207
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,018
What thoughts you got in your head?!

208
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,779
Here.

209
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,295
Dear guests!

210
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,415
To the wedding couple!

211
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,010
To the wedding couple!

212
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,333
The funny Bajazzo.

213
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,490
- Hey, you there!
- She calls us.

214
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,413
- You have to eat something too.
- Thank You, we're coming

215
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,896
- Where are You?
- Come and sit with us!

216
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,010
No time.

217
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,698
Come with me!

218
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,653
- I have to eat first.
- Come!

219
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,738
Where are you taking me?

220
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,216
I'll slap you, if you 
won't let me go.

221
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,371
Oswaldo, look who's here!

222
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,696
This is Oswaldo, he's ill
and may not go outside.

223
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,733
No one visits him. Make 
him laugh a little.

224
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,736
How?

225
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,500
The way you did before, downstairs.

226
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,930
Birdie-bird...

227
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,371
What are you dong here?
I'll teach you manners!

228
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,335
And what do You want? Out!

229
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,210
Do You always eat standing, 
like a horse?

230
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,090
I always eat that way.

231
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:07,451
I saw enough marriages, was married 
twice myself, both husbands are dead.

232
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,579
I'm standing in the kitchen since three 
o'clock, but I'm not tired yet!

233
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,535
I could dance the whole night long,
the youngsters can't handle it anymore.

234
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,816
Why You won't marry?

235
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:27,332
One more husband? No, thanks.
I like to decide on my own!

236
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,770
Do You need men only to make...
decisions?

237
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,692
Why? I'm not made of stone,
everybody needs some joy, or not?

238
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,136
What do you want? Get lost!

239
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,378
My first husband was as big 
and strong as You are.

240
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,970
I still have his suits,
they fit for no one.

241
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,378
There, upstairs...!

242
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,976
I'll bring You some.

243
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,491
There is a boy with a inspectrice...

244
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,177
Here, eat some.

245
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,099
Help me to get some wine - 
there is not much left.

246
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,213
Tell me, all the suits...
are just hanging there?

247
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:22,619
- There are no big men anymore.
- Is there a hat too?

248
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:28,850
- I could use one.
- Yes, come and see for yourself.

249
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,530
Good bye!

250
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,012
Zampano, do You remember, 
how beautiful it sounded?

251
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,813
The day when it rained...

252
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:04,497
Teach me to play the trumpet,
I'll learn it fast for sure.

253
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,091
You taught it to Rosa too?
She worked the same like me?

254
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,976
And, how do I look?

255
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,296
Right for the women!

256
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,370
May I smoke in here?

257
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,978
- What's up with you?
- Nothing!

258
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,456
- Why are you blubbering then?
- Because...

259
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,773
Come up!

260
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,132
Come on.

261
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,376
- You want to stay there the whole night?
- Yes, the whole night!

262
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,938
I go away.

263
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,009
Back to my village. I don't like 
it here with You anymore!

264
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:30,173
It's not because of the work:
I like this work.

265
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,575
I like being an artist!

266
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,334
But I don't like You!

267
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,339
What?

268
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,538
I leave!

269
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,530
- I go home.
- Stop the bullshit.

270
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,369
I let the shoes here. And 
this coat I leave too.

271
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,059
I let everything here.

272
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:21,650
Enough! Always the same!

273
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,937
I leave!

274
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,171
And now "Il Matto" will show us
his most dangerous attraction!

275
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,170
He'll eat spaghetti standing 
in a forty meter height!

276
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,295
We ask for absolute silence,
already the smallest distraction

277
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,936
can let it end deadly!

278
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,289
Dear audience!

279
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,937
Now you'll see "Il Matto"
with his unique performance!

280
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,416
Hey, how are you up there?
Everything is fine?

281
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:44,455
I'm fine, but it freshens up a little,
additionally I have a hunger!

282
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,340
You can say, I'm 2 
times hungrier now!

283
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,419
This wind! It stole my napkin!

284
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:57,058
Why You don't ask, whether someone 
want to take a place with You?

285
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,091
Who wants to come, is welcome!

286
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,096
Thanks, thank You very much.

287
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,938
One moment!

288
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,692
- Anna, I'll wait for you at the tavern.
- All right.

289
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,739
Watch out!

290
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,331
Make some room!

291
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,016
Soldats! Attention!

292
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,975
- One, two, one...
- A crazy girl!

293
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,736
I go home.

294
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:59,688
- Hey, you want to drink some?
- She already drank more then us!

295
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,648
Get in.

296
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,611
I don't want to go with You.
I don't want it anymore!

297
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,613
No, never!

298
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,619
Get in!

299
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,539
Come here!

300
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,372
Move!

301
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,254
Quickly!

302
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,617
And be quiet!

303
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,056
You want to say something?

304
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,698
Good, already thought you don't!

305
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,212
Good morning.

306
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,492
Good morning.

307
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,533
Come over here!

308
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,415
Please, take a seat!

309
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,616
Say hello to the boss and his wife.

310
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,735
Everything she knows,
she learned from me.

311
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,053
Do You want some coffee?

312
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,490
Come on! Drink it.

313
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,575
When I picked her up, she 
didn't even have shoes.

314
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,133
But she didn't come around 
much in the world yet.

315
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:39,655
Strong wind today. Do not 
let the tent fly away!

316
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:45,539
There is no wage, you'll get anything, 
what you'll be able to collect.

317
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,858
Every artist goes around with 
the hat, no one gets short.

318
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:54,850
- I never had any controversies.
- You'll start today then.

319
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,455
I can see, You have one 
for the hat already.

320
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,618
Take care of the tent, it flies away!

321
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:05,049
- Where are we here?
- In Rom, this is St. Paul.

322
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,295
And we'll work in a circus?

323
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,651
- Good material it is.
- Come with me, please.

324
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:21,409
- How many people go here altogether?
- 400 places, and ones, who stand...

325
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,448
Do You know him?

326
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,013
Good morning.

327
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,496
Who we've got here! Mr. "Rufle"!

328
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,777
It's great, that You gave him an appointment, 
a good circus needs animals!

329
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,213
Sorry, I'm just kidding.
A cigarette?

330
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:45,016
Oh, you got one already.
He's really a great artist.

331
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:48,337
A great programme, but 
your best piece is

332
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,815
that chain thing, this is phenomenal.

333
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:54,535
I give you a good advice:
Don't speak to me. Never!

334
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,859
Otherwise there'll be a tragedy.
Got it?

335
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:01,973
- It was just a joke...
- I warned you.

336
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,219
Madame!

337
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,456
Well done!

338
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,253
Be brave, "Rufle"!

339
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,459
What a poseur!

340
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,694
Stay calm, otherwise you'll fail!

341
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:08,769
And now a new attraction in
the world famous circus "Girafa":

342
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,332
Zampano! A man with lungs of steel.

343
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:28,414
Dear audience!
Here is a chain, from what each

344
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:33,011
limb is thicker then 0.5 cm, pure 
iron, stronger than steel!

345
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:39,571
I'll put it around my chest and 
close it with this hook.

346
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,615
By a simple expansion of the chest 

347
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:47,699
muscles, I'll blow up the hook.

348
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,654
You think the hook is a fake?
Wait a moment!

349
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,689
Convince yourself!

350
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,971
This patch I got for
protectional purposes...

351
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,012
Bravo! Bravissimo!

352
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:10,375
...but not to let you see how the 
hook bores itself in the meat.

353
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,210
You don't need to have 
the strength of 4 bulls,

354
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,416
You don't have to be a professor,

355
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,930
in order to understand, that 
for this unique attraction

356
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:27,931
only three things are necessary:
steel muscles, iron lungs

357
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,651
and superhuman strength.

358
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,375
Leave the audience!

359
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:36,851
Those, who have weak nerves, 
should better look away...

360
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,216
It starts with a dull drumroll.

361
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,456
Signorina Gelsomina, please!

362
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,813
Zampano, excuse me, 
a phone call for you!

363
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,452
You bastard! 
It's your turn now, come on, quick!

364
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,773
Don't get angry, let me talk to him.

365
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,413
I'll kill him!

366
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,658
I'll kill him!

367
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,533
Where is he?

368
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,650
Where are you?

369
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,729
- Where are you?
- Be reasonable! Stay here!

370
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:33,689
- Did he hide here somewhere?
- Nobody's here.

371
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,495
Behind which stone did you crawl?

372
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:45,657
You'll have enough of 
your dumb jokes!

373
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,012
This coward hides from me...

374
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,209
- Why is he so hostile to You?
- I don't know.

375
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,689
- You did something to him?
- Nothing, never did!

376
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:19,370
He insults me, but one day
there'll be a payoff!

377
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,212
Who is he?

378
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,210
A son of a gipsy.

379
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,693
- You know him from former times?
- Unfortunately I do.

380
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,256
Did Rosa know him too?

381
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,771
He doesn't know anybody - neither 
Rosa nor me, understood?

382
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:47,209
I don't want to hear anything about 
him anymore. I go to bed.

383
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,576
Here she comes! Look, how she walks!

384
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:56,972
And what a face she has!
You see?

385
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,058
You take this. Let's go.

386
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,012
Put the bucket away.

387
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:06,735
I've got my own methods, 
they always work.

388
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,211
- Gelsomina works with us!
- Calm down.

389
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,496
Try it.

390
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:19,017
Wonderful, what a talent!

391
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,619
And now, attention!

392
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:24,335
I play the violin, and 
when you hear this...

393
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:29,696
you sneak quietly behind 
me 'till there,

394
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,936
and blow the trombone.

395
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,173
- Got it? Let's try.
- I can't.

396
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,648
- Why?
- Zampano doesn't want me to.

397
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,859
Do You hear that? Afterwards 
I'll be accused again.

398
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,259
Get Zampano. Let's see, who 
decides here about whom.

399
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,974
- He went to the city.
- I'll talk to him later then.

400
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:52,172
Don't be afraid, we're one family,

401
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,452
we work together. What you 
learn is good for all of us.

402
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,334
Attention: when I play this...

403
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,459
Got it? Really?

404
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:11,732
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'll play a very,

405
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,374
very sad melody for you.

406
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,851
Come on, now!

407
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:31,932
Wonderful! Very good.

408
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:35,098
Travelling with Zampano
harms the intelligence!

409
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,610
You should interrupt me

410
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:41,130
and come where I am standing!

411
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,138
We try it again. Now!

412
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,853
Nice, you see?

413
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,574
Watch out: we do it three times.

414
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,896
Then I go around the manege,

415
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,897
while you walk behind me
and blows the trombone.

416
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,534
Got it?
It's very simple.

417
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:12,814
One finger here and the other there.

418
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,574
Bravo, Gelsomina!

419
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,340
And now let's go:
One, two...

420
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:35,290
What's the problem, Zampano? 
I told her to work with him.

421
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,650
She works only with me.

422
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:44,136
You weren't here, or I 
would have ask You.

423
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,774
What's the big deal?
We work together here.

424
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,891
She won't work with him!

425
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,056
You will leave her in peace!

426
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,775
I don't talk with you. You've 
forbidden me to do it.

427
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:54,890
Although I won't say anything.

428
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:58,293
Go to my wife, Gelsomina,
I'll deal with this.

429
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:01,413
She stays here. I decide, 
what she's got to do.

430
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,615
And she's not allowed to 
work with this vagabond!

431
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,651
- Why not?
- Because I want it that way.

432
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,896
I want it that way.

433
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,455
If I'll see you once 
again with him...

434
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,579
Zampano, let off him!

435
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,499
Hold him back!

436
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,260
Run after them!

437
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,617
These goddamn gypsies!

438
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,410
He's got a knife!

439
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,536
Calm down, nothing bad will happen.

440
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:53,011
Be careful, he's got a knife!

441
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:00,612
Don't make a step, or I'll kill you!

442
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,252
Open up the door!

443
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,734
Open up!

444
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,012
Stay back!

445
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,608
- What's the problem here?
- Nothing.

446
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:18,380
Hey you, put the knife away!

447
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:23,735
Nothing like that ever 
happened in my circus!

448
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,250
The police handcuffed 
and arrested him!

449
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:32,056
- But it wasn't his fault...
- We never had problems with police!

450
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,573
What do you want to do now?

451
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:37,658
You stay with us, otherwise 
she'll look for this rude.

452
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:42,650
You can be lucky, that it happened 
this way, now you're free.

453
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:46,974
What will you do alone? With us 
you finally won't be hungry.

454
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,408
But the motorcycle?

455
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:52,659
- The police will keep an eye on it.
- Gelsomina, stay with us.

456
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:56,899
- Where should I sleep?
- There's some room in my wagon.

457
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:01,457
Now move it! The tractor will 
arrive at half past four.

458
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,255
You can come with us,

459
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,257
but if you want to wait, then tell him,

460
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:10,294
that I'll never work with him anymore.
And not with the other one! Never!

461
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,172
Let it down!

462
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,333
You were asleep already?

463
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:43,098
It stinks awful in here!
How you can stand it?

464
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:48,448
No, Zampano is still in jail.
He'll be free by tomorrow, perhaps.

465
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,850
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, perhaps.

466
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:57,617
It's all Your fault. Zampano 
didn't do anything to You.

467
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,534
And they let You go first.

468
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:05,177
I agree, in a certain way I'm 
the cause of his misfortune.

469
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,974
But he had the knife.

470
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,615
Come out.

471
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:13,654
Come!

472
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:17,100
Perhaps the prison will 
be of use for him.

473
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,768
He still got so many years to live!

474
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:22,175
But with me it'll be over soon.

475
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:26,617
Nice gown you have!
Take a seat.

476
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,219
Come on. Sit down

477
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,339
What a strange face!

478
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:45,890
Are you really a woman?
You look like an artichoke!

479
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:53,374
I don't know yet, if I'll
stay with Zampano.

480
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,218
I can go with the circus.

481
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,332
The best chance to get rid of him.

482
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:08,498
He'll look funny, when he'll be 
released from jail and all are away!

483
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:14,410
That's how you have to do it!
That will be fun!

484
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,616
I don't have anything against him.

485
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:22,938
But when I see his face, all 
my limbs itch to hit him.

486
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:25,173
I don't know why at all.

487
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,573
I just can't hold me back.

488
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:35,295
But you, how you two came together?

489
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,937
He gave 10.000 Lire to my mother.

490
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:39,849
That much?

491
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,456
I've got four sisters,
all younger than me.

492
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,177
Do you like him?

493
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:49,650
- Me?
- Yes, you! Who else?

494
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:52,295
Why you won't run away from him?

495
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:57,210
I tried already, but I can't.

496
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,572
What do you mean, "but I can't"?

497
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:05,889
You can stay with him 
or go with the circus.

498
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,494
If I go with them or with Zampano,

499
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,612
it's the same for me.

500
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,539
It doesn't make a difference.

501
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:20,130
Nobody needs me.

502
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:24,819
What for do I live?

503
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,650
- Can you cook?
- What?

504
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:34,814
You're a good cook?

505
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,653
No.

506
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:40,378
What can you do then? 
Dancing? Singing?

507
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:42,411
A little.

508
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:44,693
Maybe...

509
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:49,618
it's love, which brings you joy?

510
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,329
You have to enjoy anything.

511
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,254
If you would be not that ugly...

512
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:05,133
Why am I born to this world?

513
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:12,010
And if I'll offer you 
to come with me?

514
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:14,017
I'll teach you to become a ropedancer.

515
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:17,417
High above, in the spotlights!

516
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:20,174
I've got a car, we can drive around,

517
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:24,453
we'll have a lot of fun!
What do you think?

518
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,288
You don't want to...

519
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:34,176
You have to stay with Zampano, to be 
involved in all his stupid things

520
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:38,373
and let him hit you like a donkey!

521
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,775
That's life.

522
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:50,895
But, Zampano must keep you only,
because he's got something on you.

523
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:55,776
You already ran away once,
what he did then?

524
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,494
He's beaten me up.

525
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,017
Why he didn't let you go?

526
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,413
Strange,

527
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:11,977
I won't keep you one day 
more then necessary!

528
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:14,492
Maybe...

529
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,616
Maybe he likes you?

530
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,456
Zampano? Me?

531
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:25,812
Yes, he's like a dog:

532
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:30,412
a dog, who looks like he's trying 
to speak, but can only bark.

533
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,850
Poor Zampano.

534
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,129
Yea, poor...

535
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,055
But...

536
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:46,815
if you won't stay with him,
who else will?

537
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:51,850
I'm not educated well, just 
read a couple of books.

538
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:56,731
Every existing thing,
is here on purpose.

539
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,737
For example...

540
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:01,738
- This stone here...
- Which one?

541
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:05,455
This one. It's here for some reason.

542
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:07,491
And this little stone...

543
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:10,130
- For what?
- For...

544
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:12,014
What do I know?!

545
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:14,131
If I knew that, then I would be...

546
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:16,854
the almighty God, who knows everything.

547
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:21,178
When you're born, when you 
die, who knows that.

548
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:28,730
I don't know for what that stone is 
good, but it has got its function.

549
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:32,171
Or everything would be meaningless.

550
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,211
Even the stars.

551
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,538
That's, what I believe at least.

552
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,618
And you...

553
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,734
You're good for something as well.

554
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:47,091
With your artichokelike face.

555
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:08,975
I'll buy some matches tomorrow
and lit everything!

556
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,535
Mattresses, sheets, everything!

557
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,493
So he'll understand!

558
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,214
I didn't say, I don't 
want to go with him.

559
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:20,129
He paid 10.000 Lire, I do the 
whole work and he sleeps!

560
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:26,131
That's his nature. He 
doesn't think at all.

561
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,649
I tell him that and 
he says: "Whatever."

562
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,339
What is that good for?

563
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:33,134
And he'll get some poison either!
In his soup.

564
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,571
No, I better burn it all up!

565
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,898
And if I won't stay with him,
who else will do?

566
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:47,576
So they said, that you 
can stay with them?

567
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,493
Wake up!

568
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:56,488
Did they really say, that 
you could stay with them?

569
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:00,215
They didn't say anything about me?

570
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:05,411
They didn't want to work with 
You anymore. Or with Zampano.

571
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:11,817
As if it is of a big value 
for me, to work with them.

572
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:14,659
They need me, but I 
don't need anybody!

573
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:16,532
Today I'm here, tomorrow somewhere else!

574
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:20,619
I get bored too fast. Freedom is 
the most important thing for me.

575
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:23,129
That's how I am.

576
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:27,094
I don't even need a warm place to sleep.

577
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:30,936
Why did You say, that You'll die soon?

578
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:36,018
I am often thinking  about death.
Must be the profession.

579
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:39,778
...and suddenly it's over.

580
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:42,858
Once I'll break my neck,
no one will cry for me.

581
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:44,689
- And Your mother?

582
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:50,417
So, will you wait for him?
Or you'll go with them?

583
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:57,530
So you want to be with him,
I'll bring you to the police.

584
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:01,177
Then you'll be right there,
when they release him.

585
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:05,418
He'll be surprised!

586
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,691
What a hell of a device!

587
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,612
Get out!

588
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,371
There are the barracks.

589
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:43,250
So long.

590
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:45,294
You're leaving?

591
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:49,659
Yes, or do you want to come with me?

592
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:58,612
What should I do with a girl,
who isn't good for anything?

593
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:09,019
Gelsomina...

594
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:12,691
Here is...

595
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:17,016
a little souvenir.

596
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,615
So long, Gelsomina!

597
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:11,098
Zampano, here I am.

598
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:20,174
The circus people wanted to keep me,

599
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,775
- but...
- You could have gone then.

600
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:32,055
- In which direction is our house?
- There.

601
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,771
I wanted to go back home once,

602
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:50,575
but now it's not important anymore.

603
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:56,608
Now my home is with You.

604
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:59,935
Really?
What a great discovery,

605
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:04,816
you were hungry at home!
You're better with me.

606
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:09,296
You're an animal!
Nothing in your head!

607
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:16,770
- Then it'll be a time for fasting?
- Never!

608
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:23,172
A storm is coming up, where 
is the next village?

609
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:28,695
Magliano, 18 km from here,
but it's behind the mountains.

610
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:33,093
We won't get there - not 
enough fuel in tank!

611
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:38,459
There is our monastery.

612
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,219
Please, wait.

613
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:52,490
Matron, I've got the oil.

614
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:56,488
May this man stay with 
us for one night?

615
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:01,410
Excuse me, we don't have 
enough fuel left,

616
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:05,369
it's getting dark soon, it's still
far until we reach the village

617
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,457
and my wife doesn't feel well...

618
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:12,575
- He can sleep in the barn, maybe?
- Well, but only for one night.

619
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:16,932
She allowed it, there is 
enough room in the barn.

620
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,173
Thank You, matron.

621
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:30,459
- I've got something else for You.
- Thanks.

622
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:40,249
- And You, You want some more?
- Come on and take it.

623
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:48,212
She works with You?

624
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:51,214
She helps me a little bit.

625
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:54,890
Blows the trumpet, plays the tambourine.

626
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:57,654
Show, what you can do to the sister.

627
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,531
Great!

628
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:46,370
- How well you can play!
- Yes, now do the dishes!

629
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,855
- No, I'll do it.
- That's her job to do.

630
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:54,054
We'll do it together.
How beautiful it sounded!

631
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:58,372
- What's this melody?
- I don't know.

632
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,730
What are you trying to do?

633
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:05,138
That's not the right work to 
do for a sister like You.

634
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:09,379
- Hand it over.
- I'm doing this every day.

635
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:17,848
You always sleep inside of it?

636
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:22,576
It's enough space. I got a lamp,
some pottery, like in a real home.

637
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:27,296
Very nice. Do You like the travelling?

638
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:31,732
- That's his work.
- We use to move along as well.

639
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:34,215
Every two years we have to 
move to another monastery.

640
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,570
- This is my second already.
- And why?

641
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:39,817
So we can't get used to secular things.

642
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:44,730
If you stay longer at one place,
you start to like it

643
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:49,536
and forgets, what's more important, 
then anything on earth, God.

644
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:54,939
We both are travellers: she 
follows her God, I follow mine.

645
01:14:55,140 --> 01:15:00,339
- Yes, each one follows her own.
- You would like to inspect the monastery?

646
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:04,579
Please, accompany me. The monastery 
is over 1000 years old.

647
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,931
Why are You taking me with You?

648
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:25,450
I don't look good, I can't cook,
can't do anything...

649
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:27,932
What happened?

650
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:31,971
Go to sleep.

651
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:35,733
What strange things you're 
thinking about?

652
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:52,138
It's raining.
It is nice here.

653
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:01,138
Will You be sorry about 
me, if I'll die?

654
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:06,335
Why do you want to die?

655
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,609
I wanted to die once.

656
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:13,654
Be dead is better then to 
stay with him, I thought.

657
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:22,089
Now I'm ready even to marry You.

658
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:28,978
We'll stay together. Even a 
stone is good for anything.

659
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:34,050
You have to consider sometimes.
But You never reflect on things!

660
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:37,377
- There is nothing to think about.
- But yes, there is!

661
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:41,856
And what do you want to think?!
Sleep immediately.

662
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,853
I don't want to listen 
to this crap anymore!

663
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:47,290
Sleep, I'm tired.

664
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:05,540
Do You like me a little bit?

665
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:23,652
Stop it!

666
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:02,292
There are silver hearts hangin,

667
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,934
but my hands are too big,
you have to try!

668
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:09,732
- No, I don't want to.
- What has got into you?

669
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,977
- No, You can't do this!
- Be quiet!

670
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:29,852
Thank You, venerable matron.

671
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,335
Thank You, good bye.

672
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,290
She cries! Wait a moment.

673
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,699
Why are you crying?

674
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:43,976
Do You want to stay here?

675
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:47,648
I'll speak to the matron.

676
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,819
Sisters!

677
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,653
Here, put that away.

678
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:58,650
Thank You for Your kind heart
and the hospitality.

679
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:02,656
Thank You very much from 
a modest artist like me.

680
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,215
Push!

681
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:14,051
"Rufle"! You're right on time.

682
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:28,013
I would also help you.

683
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:38,892
But, "Rufle"!

684
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:45,377
Throw that thing away!

685
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:54,090
That's for your dumb jokes!

686
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:57,289
Zampano, stop it! That's enough!

687
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:02,578
You're trying to kill me?

688
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:11,292
- That was the gift from the "Rufle"!
- Come on! Please!

689
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:14,533
- Next time you'll have more!
- Any more?

690
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:22,176
He broke my watch!

691
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:47,693
Zampano, come quick, he's really bad!

692
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:54,376
He's bad...

693
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:03,739
He dies...

694
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:11,933
- Don't be a fool!
- He dies...

695
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:15,859
He dies...

696
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,451
Be quiet!

697
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,449
Hey, you?

698
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:40,613
Be quiet!

699
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:46,414
Be quiet finally!

700
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:55,010
I'm in deep shit now.

701
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:37,296
Those, who are sensible,
should look away,

702
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:40,617
when the hook gets into 
the flesh, it can bleed!

703
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:43,050
Here comes the announcing drum roll!

704
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:45,330
Gelsomina, please!

705
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:51,179
Signorina Gelsomina!
Drum roll, please!

706
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:59,298
"Il Matto", he feels bad...

707
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:05,256
"Il Matto", he feels bad...

708
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:34,612
What do you think?
What has got into you?

709
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:41,051
Nobody have seen us,
nobody is looking for us!

710
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,939
No one think about it, not even us.

711
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:50,493
I'm hungry.

712
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,612
Stay here.

713
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:56,858
I'll deal with it.

714
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:25,253
Where are you going?

715
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:30,777
Where are you going?

716
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,935
Where are you heading? Tell me.

717
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:47,608
You want to go back home?

718
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:08,739
Here.

719
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:12,332
Eat something.

720
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:17,858
Stop the blubbering! That's enough!

721
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:21,815
I can't hear it any longer!

722
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:27,214
- I'll take a rest now.
- No!

723
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:30,578
Don't come in!

724
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:34,214
All right, I'll sleep outside.

725
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:11,776
- It's nice here.
- It's cold.

726
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:17,258
Sit down.

727
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:20,171
Get some sunlight.

728
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:57,295
Let's eat some soup.

729
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:11,328
Something's missing.

730
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:14,732
No need, I'll do it.

731
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:22,258
Finally! You didn't make 
a move for ten days!

732
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:35,130
I didn't want to kill him.
I only hit him twice.

733
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:40,256
He was fine, just some nose bleeding.

734
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,489
Then I let off him.

735
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:47,412
Do I have to end in jail 
because of some fight?

736
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:50,851
I only want to do my work.
Do I not have a right to live?

737
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:09,296
Finally we can move along once again.

738
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:12,414
There is a big fair,

739
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:17,138
a couple of kilometers ahead.
We can earn good money there.

740
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:20,900
What? What do you have again?

741
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:25,137
"Il Matto", he feels bad.

742
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:40,414
I'll bring you back home.

743
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:43,649
You want back to your mother?

744
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:48,329
You don't want back to your mother?

745
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:51,777
If I won't stay with you,
who else will do?

746
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:54,608
But it can't go on like that.

747
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:57,653
I have to earn money again!

748
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:00,534
You're crazy! Crazy!

749
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:14,578
If you want to sleep, then go 
inside, it's too cold here.

750
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:17,372
We have to move on.

751
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:29,814
You have killed him.
It's really nice here, outside.

752
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:35,895
I wanted tog o away from You,
but he said, I should stay.

753
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:44,850
We need more wood for the fire.

754
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:59,732
Today, Gala performance by the
world famous circus "Medini"!

755
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:04,855
International attractions!
Oriental artists!

756
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:09,576
and sketches, from which You'll
fall off the chairs!

757
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:15,978
Our name means a

758
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:19,456
quality obligation for us!

759
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:23,818
Let's go home now, children.

760
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:28,536
Come with your parents today!
Children pay half entrance.

761
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:31,618
- Where do you go?
- Just a bit.

762
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:34,377
Should I accompany you?

763
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:37,537
No, I'll be back n a minute.

764
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:50,851
One for 30.

765
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:58,057
And some lemon.

766
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:51,694
Hey, You there!

767
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:55,213
Where do You know it from?
That melody.

768
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:59,289
- Which melody?
- One You just sang.

769
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,013
Oh, You mean this one...

770
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:07,657
It's from a girl, who stayed with us.

771
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:09,373
When?

772
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:12,617
That was long time ago.
Four or five years back.

773
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:16,938
She always played it on her 
trumpet, I'll never forget it.

774
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:19,819
And where is she now?

775
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:23,055
She has died.

776
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:28,734
Are You a circus artist? She was 
of the same kind, a vagabond.

777
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:31,329
Maybe you have known her. Nobody 
around here used to know her.

778
01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:33,337
She never have spoken.

779
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:39,013
She was a little bit crazy.
My father found her near the beach.

780
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:42,573
She was ill. Some sort of fever.

781
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:46,614
We took her to us, but 
she never said anything,

782
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:50,608
only cried. She hasn't 
eaten anything too.

783
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:53,732
When she felt better, she used to 
sit outside and play the trumpet.

784
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:56,852
And one morning. she didn't wake up.

785
01:36:57,060 --> 01:37:01,451
Our mayor tried to find 
some relatives of her.

786
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:05,294
Do You want to see the mayor?

787
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:46,378
And now Zampano, the 
man with iron lungs!

788
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:50,368
After him a posse, You'll 
laugh about a lot!

789
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:51,729
Music!

790
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,416
Ladies and gentlemen,

791
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:11,569
a chain and a hook, 0.5 cm thick,

792
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:17,093
pure iron, stronger then steel,
through an expansion...

793
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:20,849
of my breast muscles...
and my lungs...

794
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:25,611
I blow up this hook. This 
here is not to protect me,

795
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:29,096
but to spare You

796
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:33,248
the view of a blood stained 
hook in my flesh.

797
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:37,013
If somebody has got weak nerves,

798
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:39,656
then look away, please.

799
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:48,170
- Finish, you had enough.
- Leave me alone.

800
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:51,053
- Then go somewhere else.
- I said leave me alone!

801
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:52,579
I'll bring you out!

802
01:38:52,780 --> 01:38:54,498
- You're disturbing other guests.
- Waiter!

803
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:59,296
Go now, come on.
And stop the drinking!

804
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:02,458
Please, get reasonable.
Come, I'll bring you out.

805
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:04,139
Go to hell, I'll go alone!

806
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:07,571
- Don't touch me!
- There is the exit.

807
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:10,369
- He gets drunk like this every day.
- Son of a bitch!

808
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:14,698
- Stop it, please!
- Damn vagabond!

809
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:22,613
I'll break all your bones...

810
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:24,890
Let off me!

811
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:29,610
Let me...

812
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:32,380
Go away!

813
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:36,129
Come here, I'll get done 
with all of you!

814
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:39,853
Let off me, I'll show it to 
that son of a bitch!

815
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:43,172
Teach him a lesson, so 
he'll have enough.

816
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:50,176
Miserable drinker! You 
still haven't had enough?

817
01:39:56,300 --> 01:40:00,930
- Zampano, get calm.
- Let off me!

818
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:07,179
- It has no point...
- Don't touch me!

819
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:13,978
If I wouldn't be your friend,
I've already called the police.

820
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:16,740
I don't want any friends!

821
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:26,819
Why all of you don't come out?

822
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:30,090
Come out now!

823
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:32,697
I'll show you!

824
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:34,455
I'll finish you all!

825
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:45,692
I don't need anybody!

826
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:49,254
I want to be alone!

827
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:50,973
Alone!
