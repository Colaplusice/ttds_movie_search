00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,076
# Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,551
# On this, our weddin' day

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,595
# Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

4
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,193
# Wait, wait along

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,714
# The noon day train will bring Frank Miller

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,230
# If I'm a man, I must be brave

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,957
# And I must face that deadly killer

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,874
# Orlie a coward
a craven coward

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,154
# Orlie a coward in my grave

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,830
# Oh, to be torn 'tweenst love and duty
S'pposin'I lose my fair-hairbeauty

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,194
# Look at that big hand move along
Nearin' high noon

12
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,831
# He made a vow while in state prison
That it would be my life or his

13
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,838
# I'm not afraid of death, but oh

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,830
# What will I do if you leave me

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,757
# Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,557
# You made that promise when we wed

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,909
# Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,913
# Although you're grievin', I can't be leavin'

19
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,955
# Unti'l I shoot Frank Miller dead

20
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,073
# Wait along, wait along

21
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,154
Did you see what I saw? Come on,
open her up. We'll have a big day today.

22
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,113
- You're in a hurry?
- Yeah, I sure am.

23
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,108
You're a fool Come on.

24
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,233
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Let us begin.

25
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,436
Would the bride and groom
kindly step forward?

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,956
Will Kane and Amy Fowler,

27
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,836
you appear before me in my capacity
as Justice of the Peace of this township

28
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,749
to be joined together
in the bounds of holy matrimony.

29
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,114
- Man, it sure is hot
- Hot? You call this hot?

30
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,108
Well, I'll be...
I thouht I saw Ben Miller.

31
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,357
- He's down Texas somewhere.
- I know.

32
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,599
Looked Like Pierce and Colby, too.
Oh, it couldn't be.

33
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,317
My goodness gracious

34
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,518
- Noon train on time?
- Yes, sir. That is, I think so, sir.

35
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,838
Don't know reason why
it shouldn't be...Mr Pierce.

36
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,319
How're you,
Mr Miller...Mr Pierce...Mr Colby?

37
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,390
Do you, Will Kane, take Amy
to be your lawful wedded wife

38
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,798
to have and to hold from this day forward
until death do you part?

39
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,399
I do.

40
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,672
Do you Amy take Will
to be your lawful wedded husband

41
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,476
to have and to hold from this day forward
until death do you part?

42
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,956
- I do.
- The ring, please.

43
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,519
Then by the authority invested in me
by the laws of this territory,

44
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,679
I pronounce you man and wife.

45
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,276
I can't speak for the rest of you,
but I claim an ancient privilege.

46
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,274
Moving mighty fast for a Sunday.

47
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,996
- Will'
- All those people...

48
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,635
Amy, people ought to be alone
when they get married.

49
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,910
I know.

50
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,999
I'm gonna try, Amy. I'll do my best.

51
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,712
I will too.

52
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,912
Honeymoon is officially over.
Come on, everybody.

53
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,352
- Don't look so shocked.
- No privacy on his wedding day.

54
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,793
Well, one more ceremony,
and Will's a free man, more or less.

55
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,195
Marshal, turn in your badge.

56
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,915
I hate to do this
without your new marshal being here.

57
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,272
Fuller, Haland I are the entire board
of selectmen in this community.

58
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,630
We're also your very good friends.

59
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,356
With the fine job you've done I feel free
to say, and the judge will bail me out,

60
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,109
this town will be safe 'til tomorrow.

61
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,711
You win. But don't marry a Quaker,
she'll have you running a store.

62
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,957
- I can't picture you doing that, Will
- I can.

63
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,038
So can I, and a good thing, too.

64
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,117
Thank you.

65
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,357
You didn't talk that way
when you wore a star.

66
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,229
All right, it's coming off.
But I gotta to be paid first.

67
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,790
- Let me down!
- Not until you kiss me.

68
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,310
Will, let me down, you fool!

69
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,034
-

70
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,718
- You should have been a lawyer.
- I was meant to be a storekeeper.

71
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,673
Marshal, a telegram for you.

72
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,793
It's terrible, it's shocking.

73
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,514
- They've pardoned Frank Miller.
- I don't believe it.

74
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,836
We could go too.

75
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,600
- Nice of them to let you know.
- That ain't all.

76
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,792
Ben Miller is down the depot
with Pierce and Colby.

77
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,310
- He asked about the noon train.
- The noon train?

78
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,917
Well.. You get out of this town.
Get out of this town this very minute.

79
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,069
- What is it?
- Never mind that now.

80
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,354
- What is it, Mr Howe?
- Just get out, and everything will be fine.

81
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,710
- We'll take care of everything.
- I ought to stay.

82
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,117
Are you crazy?
Think of Amy.

83
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,279
Goodbye, Amy.
Don't worry, everything will be allright

84
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,039
Hm... That's funny.

85
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,992
- What?
- Oh, you can't see now.

86
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,679
Kane and his new wife
just took off in a big hurry.

87
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,190
- What's so funny?
- I mean, a big hurry.

88
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,636
Hey, you don't suppose
Kane's scared of those three gunnies?

89
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,236
I never saw him whip a horse that way.

90
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,908
- Sam?
- Come in, Helen.

91
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,240
Ben Miller is in town.
He has two of the old bunch with him.

92
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,912
I guess I'll take a look around.

93
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,151
- Why are you stopping?
- It's no good. I've got go back, Amy.

94
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,557
- Why?
- This is crazy. I haven't got any guns.

95
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,150
- Then let's go on. Hurry.
- No.

96
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,316
That's what I've been thinking.

97
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,193
They're making me run.
I've never run from anybody before.

98
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,712
- I don't understand any ofthis.
- I don't have time to tell you.

99
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,879
- Then don't go back, Will
- I've got to. That's the whole thing.

100
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,672
Kane's back!

101
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,269
- Don't believe it.
- Just seen him!

102
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,556
- How many coffins have we got?
- Two.

103
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,955
We'll need at least two more,
no matter how you figure it.

104
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,196
You better get busy, Fred.

105
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,874
Please, Will, if you'd just tell me
what this is all about.

106
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,959
I sent a man up five years ago for murder.
He was supposed to hang.

107
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,551
But up north, they commuted it to life
and now he's free.

108
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,149
I don't know how.
It looks like he's coming back.

109
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,555
- I still don't understand.
- He's a...

110
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,754
He was always wild and kind of crazy.
He'll probably make trouble.

111
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,157
But that's no concern of yours.
Not any more.

112
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,430
I'm the one who sent him up.

113
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,316
But that was part of your job.
They've got a new marshal

114
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,435
He won't be here until tomorrow.
Seems to me I've got to stay.

115
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,872
- I'm the same man with or without this.
- That isn't so.

116
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,675
He'll come looking for me.
Three of his old bunch are waiting for him.

117
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,475
- That's why we ought to go.
- They'll just come after us.

118
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,832
Four of them...
And we'd be all alone in the prairie.

119
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,277
- We've got an hour.
- What's an hour?

120
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,836
We'd never be able to keep that store, Amy.

121
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,634
We'd have to run again
as long as we live.

122
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,594
No, you wouldn't.
Not, if they didn't know where to find us.

123
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,238
- I'm begging you, please, let's go.
- I can't.

124
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,149
Don't try to be a hero.
You don't have to be a hero, not for me.

125
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,069
I'm not not trying to be a hero.
If you think I like this, you're crazy.

126
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,636
Look, Amy. This is my town.
I've got friends here.

127
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,311
I'll swear in deputies, and with a posse
behind me, maybe there won't be trouble.

128
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,911
- You know there'll be trouble.
- Then, it's better to have it here.

129
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,319
I'm sorry, honey.
I know how you feel about it.

130
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,911
- Do you?
- Of course I do. It's against your religion.

131
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,910
- Sure I know how you feel
- But you're doing it just the same.

132
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,750
Oh, Will..
We were married just a few minutes ago.

133
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,238
We've got our whole lives ahead of us.
Doesn't that mean anything?

134
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,989
You know I've only got an hour,
and I've got lots to do.

135
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,475
Stay at the hotel until it's over.

136
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,035
No, I won't be here when it's over.

137
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,869
You're asking me to wait an hour to find out
if I'll be a wife or a widow.

138
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,277
- It's too long to wait. I won't do it.
- Amy...

139
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,871
If you won't go with me now,
I'll be on that train when it leaves here.

140
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,317
I've got to stay.

141
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,790
- Glad you got hero, Percy.
- Are you?

142
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,155
Have you forgotten
that I passed sentence on Frank Miller?

143
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,920
You shouldn't have come back, Will

144
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,795
I figured I had to. I figured I had to stay.

145
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,073
- You figured wrong.
- I can deputise a posse, 10-12 guns.

146
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,273
- My intuition tells me otherwise.
- Why?

147
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,396
No time for a lesson in civics, my boy.

148
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,875
In the 5th century BC
the citizens of Athens,

149
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,675
having suffered under a tyrant,
managed to banish him.

150
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,190
When he returned years later
with an army of mercenary,

151
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,154
those same citizens
not only opened their gates for him,

152
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,831
but stood by while he executed
members of the League of Government.

153
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,990
Similar thing happened eight years ago
in a town called Indian Falls.

154
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,150
I escaped death only through the intercess on
of a lady of somewhat dubious reputation,

155
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,512
and the cost of a handsome ring
which once belonged to my mother.

156
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,790
Unfortunately, I have no more rings.

157
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,630
- You're a judge.
- Been a judge many times and many towns.

158
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,198
- I hope to live to be a judge again.
- I can't tell you what to do.

159
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,430
Why must you be so stupid? Have you forgotten
what he's done? That he's crazy?

160
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,835
Don't you rememher
when he sat there and said:

161
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,512
''You'll never hang me. I'll come back
I swear it. I'll kill you, Kane!''

162
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,035
Here you are, ma'am.
This will take you to St. Louis.

163
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,800
Thank you.

164
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,395
Maybe you'd rather wait somewhere else.
Like at the hotel, maybe.

165
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,876
- All right thank you.
- I'm sorry about all this, Mrs Kane.

166
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,356
Don't you worry.
The marshal'll take care of himself.

167
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,028
Thank you very much.

168
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,149
Hey, that wasn't here five years ago.

169
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,831
- So what?
- Nothing...yet.

170
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,436
Harvey, don't you think
Kane will be looking for you right now?

171
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,518
- You're really sore at him.
- Wouldn't you be if you wore me?

172
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,437
I suppose...if I wore you.

173
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,635
I'll be back in a while.

174
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,154
-

175
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,788
- Goodbye, Will
- Goodbye.

176
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,270
- You think I'm letting you down?
- No.

177
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,631
Look, this is just a dirty little village
in the middle of nowhere.

178
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,071
Nothing that happens here
is really important. Get out.

179
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,999
There isn't time.

180
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,272
What a waste. Good luck.

181
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,990
 Johnny!

182
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,789
- Why ain't you in church?
- Why ain't you?

183
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,353
Will you do somethin' for me?

184
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,235
Go find Anderson, Howe and Fuller,
and tell them I want them here.

185
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,989
- Then find Harv Pell!
- Don't have to do that. I'm right here.

186
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,272
- Where have you been?
- Busy.

187
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,948
You know what's doing?
We've got lots to do.

188
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,948
Hold up a second.
This ain't really your job, you know.

189
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,073
- That's what everybody keeps telling me.
- Just listen a second.

190
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,512
- All right, I'm listening.
- This is the way I see it.

191
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,953
If you'd gone with the new marshal
not due till tomorrow, I'd be in charge, right?

192
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,508
If I'm good enough to hold down the job
when there's trouble,

193
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,950
how come the city fathers
didn't trust me with it permanently?

194
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,628
- I don't know.
- Don't you?

195
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,913
- No.
- I figure you carry a lot of weight.

196
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,795
Maybe they didn't ask me.
Maybe they figured you were too young.

197
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,709
- You think I'm too young too?
- You sure act like it sometimes. Come on.

198
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:25,637
It's very simple, Will You just tell
the old boys that I'm the new marshal.

199
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,515
Tomorrow they can tell the other fellow
that the job's filled.

200
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,110
- You really mean it, don't you?
- Sure.

201
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,910
- But I can't do it.
- Why not?

202
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,669
- If you don't know, it's no use me tellin' you.
- You mean you won't do it?

203
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,394
- Have it your way.
- All right

204
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,832
The truth is, you probably
talked against me from the start.

205
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,272
You've been sore about me
and Helen Ramirez right along, ain't you?

206
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,552
You and Helen Ramirez? I...

207
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,550
I didn't know and it doesn't mean
anything to me, you ought to know that.

208
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,830
Yeah, you've been washed up
for more than a year.

209
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,716
You get married, only, you can't stand
anybody taking your place there...

210
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,753
- ...especially me.
- You're...

211
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,675
- I haven't got time, Harv.
- Okay, let's get down to business.

212
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,189
You want me to stick,
you put a word in for me.

213
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,712
Sure I want you to stick, but I'm not buying it.
It's gotta be up to you.

214
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,599
I thought you'd grown up by now.

215
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,918
I thought your disposition might've
sweetened up a little down in Abeline.

216
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,634
I guess we're both wrong.

217
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,830
What's so funny?

218
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,349
Did you really think
you could put that over on Kane?

219
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,791
- Why not?
- When are you going to grow up?

220
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,468
- I'm getting tired of that kind of talk.
- Then grow up.

221
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,035
Cut it out!

222
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,029
- All right
- Why should he have gone for it?

223
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,073
He needs me plenty
when Frank Miller gets here.

224
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,714
- That's possible.
- He should've had me made marshal.

225
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,674
- He's just sore. Sore about you and me.
- Is he?

226
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,154
Sure.

227
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,432
- You told him?
- Sure.

228
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,995
You're a fool.

229
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,877
Why? Didn't you want him to know?

230
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,514
Hey... Who did the walking out anyway,
you or him?

231
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,788
Get out, Harvey.

232
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,639
- I might just do that.
- Then do it!

233
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,400
- You don't mean that.
- Try me.

234
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,228
You're gonna talk different
when Frank gets here.

235
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,318
You might want somebody around,
when you try to explain about Kane.

236
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,193
- I can take care of myself.
- Sure.

237
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,032
I've heard that you might not be so pretty
when he gets through with you.

238
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,590
- I won't be back.
- Good.

239
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,358
-  

240
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,596
Come in.

241
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,756
- I just saw Harvey. Is everything allright?
- I think I have to talk with Mr Weaver.

242
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,753
- You're getting out?
- Yes.

243
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,918
You want me to give Kane a hand?

244
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,278
- No.
- All right

245
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,109
May I wait here for the noon train?

246
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,673
I said, may I wait in the lobby until noon?

247
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,316
- Sure, lady.
- Thank you.

248
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,356
- You're Mrs Kane, ain't you?
- Yes.

249
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,473
You're leaving on the noon train,
but your husband ain't.

250
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,516
- No, why?
- No reason, but it's mighty interesting.

251
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,638
Now me, I wouldn't leave this town at noon
for all the tea in China.

252
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,150
No, sir.
It's going to be quite a sight to see.

253
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,836
# My eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord

254
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,913
#He's trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored

255
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,113
# He has loosed the fruitful lightening
of His terrible swift sword

256
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,518
# His truth is marching home

257
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:36,558
# Glory, glory, halleluja
Glory, glory, halleluja

258
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,069
# Glory, glory

259
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:45,992
#Halleluja
His truth is marching home

260
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,749
# He has sonded forth the trumpet
that shall never call retreat

261
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,635
# He is shifting out the hearts of men
before His judgement seat

262
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,038
- Will, I just heard...
- Hello.

263
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,913
You can count on me,
you know that, don't you?

264
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,873
- I was figuring I could.
- You cleaned this town up.

265
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,150
You made it fit
for women and kids to live in.

266
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,510
Miller or nobody else'll never
drag it down again.

267
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,395
- I hoped people'd feel that way.
- What other way is there?

268
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,878
- How many men you got Lined up?
- None yet.

269
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,713
Well, you better get going, man.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

270
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,869
- Where is he?
- He's coming up the back way. A careful man.

271
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,036
 -  

272
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,799
Come in, Mr Weaver. Hello.
Sit down, please.

273
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,912
Is there anything wrong, Mrs Ramirez?
Why did you send for me?

274
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,509
I'm leaving town.
I want to sell the store.

275
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,076
- You want to buy me out?
- How much did you want?

276
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,999
Two thousand. I think that's fair.

277
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,670
It's fair allright, but
I couldn't raise that much now.

278
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,668
- How much can you raise?
- Oh... 1000 dollars.

279
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,354
All right you can pay Sam the rest
in six months.

280
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,519
- He'll get it to me. A deal?
- Yes, ma'am.

281
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,917
All right, Mr Weaver. Thank you.

282
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,358
Mrs Ramirez, I want to
thank you for everything, I mean...

283
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,838
When you first put the deal to me
about staking me in the store,

284
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,794
and being a silent partner,
you know, my wife thought..

285
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,676
Err... What I really mean to say is that
you've been real decent to me right along,

286
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,791
and I want you to know
that I've been honest with you.

287
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,639
I know you have, MrWeaver.
Goodbye.

288
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,072
Goodbye, Mrs Ramirez.
And good luck to you.

289
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,631
- Will..
- Amy. You've changed your mind.

290
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,191
I thought you'd changed yours.

291
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,635
No, Will, I have my ticket.

292
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,076
I see.

293
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,629
Clean number 19.
Mrs Miller is very particular.

294
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,515
- Is Helen Ramirez in?
- I guess so.

295
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,317
Think you can find it allright?

296
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,195
Come in.

297
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,750
What are you looking at?
You think I have changed?

298
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,190
What do you want?
You want me to help you?

299
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,631
You want me to ask Frank to let you go?
Beg for you?

300
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,150
I would not do it.
I would not lift a finger for you.

301
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,235
I came to tell you he was coming.
I should've figured you know about it.

302
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,953
I know about it.

303
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,711
You ought to get out of town
or I might not be able to...well..

304
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,912
- Anything can happen.
- I'm not afraid of him.

305
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,910
I know you're not
but you...you know how he is.

306
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,230
I know how he is.

307
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,952
Maybe he doesn't know.

308
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,994
- He's probably got letters.
- What about it?

309
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,636
Nothing in life is free.
I'm getting out. I'm packing now.

310
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,876
That's good.

311
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,991
-

312
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,879
- Goodbye, Helen.
- Kane...

313
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,117
If you're smart, you will get out, too.

314
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,149
- I can't.
- I know.

315
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,354
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

316
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,836
- Who is Miss Ramirez?
- Mrs Ramirez?

317
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,912
She used to be a friend of your husband's
a while back.

318
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,510
Before that she was a friend of Frank Miller's.

319
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,871
I see. Thank you.

320
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,032
- You don't Like my husband, do you?
- No.

321
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,913
- Why?
- Lots of reasons.

322
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,635
This place was always busy
when Frank Miller was around.

323
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,273
I'm not the only one.

324
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,029
A plenty of people think
he's got a comeuppance coming.

325
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,471
You asked me, ma'am, so I'm telling you.

326
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,870
- I'll go and get some liquor.
- You have to have it?

327
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,116
- Yeah.
- If you're going after that...

328
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,108
- I said I was going for liquor.
- Keep away from Kane.

329
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,038
Sure.

330
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,590
- 

331
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,830
Hello, Harv. Where's the tin star?

332
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,435
- I turned it in and quit.
- Smart move.

333
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,114
I didn't ask for your opinion.

334
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,874
Hey, Ben! How are you?

335
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,038
Hey, look who's here!

336
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,560
- How are you, Ben?
- Give me a bottle.

337
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,515
- It's been a long time, Ben.
- Yeah.

338
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,597
Yes, sir. How's Frank?

339
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:20,309
- He's not complaining.
- It'll be a hot time in the old town tonight, eh?

340
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,793
I wouldn't be surprised.

341
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,993
-

342
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,634
Kane's dead by minutes after
Frank gets off the train.

343
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,389
- It's not much time.
- That's all Frank'll need, because...

344
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,316
You carry a badge and a gun, marshal
You ain't no call to do that.

345
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,950
You're right

346
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,916
No.

347
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,236
I guess you all know why I am here.

348
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,513
I need deputies. I take all I can get.

349
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,838
You must be crazy comin' in here
to raise a posse.

350
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,271
Frank's got friends in this room.
You ought to know that.

351
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,354
Some of you wore special deputies when we
broke this bunch. I need you again...now.

352
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,031
Things wore different then.
You had six steady deputies to start off with.

353
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,199
Every one a top gun.
You ain't got but two now.

354
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,359
You ain't got two.
Harv Pell says he just quit. Why?

355
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,438
That's between the two of us.

356
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,269
You're asking an awful lot,
considering the kind of man Frank is.

357
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,075
All right
We all know what Miller's like.

358
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,874
That's why I'm here. How about it?

359
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,669
- 

360
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,353
Mildred, he's coming.
Now you do like I told you.

361
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,358
I'm not home.
No matter what he says, I'm not home.

362
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,916
- Sam, he's your friend.
- Don't argue with me. He'll be here soon.

363
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,270
He won't believe me. He'll know I'm lying.

364
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,233
You do like I tell you.

365
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,280
-   

366
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,590
- Hello, Mrs Fuller. Is Sam in?
- No, he isn't.

367
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,116
Do you know where he is?
It's important to me, to find him.

368
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,757
I think... He's in church, Will.
He's gone to church.

369
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,753
- Without you?
- I'm gonna go as soon as I dress.

370
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,036
Thank you, Mrs Fuller. Goodbye.

371
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,916
What do you want?
Do you want me to get killed?

372
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,636
- Do you want to be a widow?
- No, Sam. No.

373
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,630
Kane!

374
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,233
- What's the matter, Jimmy?
- Nothin'. I've been lookin' for you.

375
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,115
I wanna a gun. I wanna be with you
when that train comes in.

376
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,675
- Can...can you handle a gun?
- Sure I can. I used to be good.

377
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,519
Honest. It ain't just gettin' even.

378
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,679
It's a chance. This is what I need.
Please, let me get in on this.

379
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,275
All right, Jimmy.
I'll call you if I need you.

380
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,789
Get yourself a drink meanwhile.

381
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,079
-   

382
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,635
Come in, Sam.

383
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,550
You're leavin' town?

384
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,190
- Where are you going?
- I don't know yet.

385
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,153
That doesn't make much sense.

386
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,998
- You're afraid, huh? Afraid of Miller.
- No.

387
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,316
Sure you are.
You wouldn't be runnin'.

388
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,637
You don't have to worry
as long as I'm around, you know that.

389
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,913
- I'll take Milleron any time.
- I believe you.

390
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,954
Then why are you goin'?
You're cuttin' out with Kane.

391
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,673
- Oh, Harvey...
- Why are you goin'?

392
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,155
- What difference does it make?
- I know it's Kane!

393
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:09,593
It isn't Kane. I'm going to tell you something
about you and your friend Kane.

394
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,951
You're a good-looking boy,
you have big broad shoulders.

395
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,878
But he is a man.

396
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,753
It takes more than broad shoulders
to make a man, Harvey,

397
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,155
and you have a long way to go.

398
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,072
You know something?
I don't think you'll ever make it.

399
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,595
Let me tell you something.
You're not goin' anywhere.

400
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,475
You're stayin' with me.
It's gonna be just like it was before.

401
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,913
You want to know why I'm leaving?
Then listen.

402
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,432
Kane will be dead in half an hour.
And nobody's going to do anything about it.

403
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,838
And when he dies, this town dies too.
I can feel it.

404
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,476
I'm all alone in the world,
I have to make a living.

405
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,717
So I'm going someplace else,
that's all.

406
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,875
And as for you, I don't like anybody to put
his hands on me unless I want him to.

407
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,913
And I don't like you to...anymore.

408
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,314
Our text today
is from Malachi, chapter four.

409
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:35,358
''For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn
as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all..''

410
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,194
Yes?

411
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,710
I'm sorry, parson,
I don't want to disturb the services...

412
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,516
You already have. You don't
come to this church very often, marshal,

413
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,917
and today
you didn't see fit to be married here.

414
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,795
What can be so important
to bring you here now?

415
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,355
I need help.

416
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,673
It's true, I haven't been a churchgoing man,
and maybe that's a bad thing.

417
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,919
I didn't get married here today
because my wife is a Quaker,

418
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,999
but I came here for help
because there are people here.

419
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,639
I'm sorry, marshal
Say what you have to say.

420
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,115
Maybe some of you already know it
but if you don't...

421
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,357
It looks like Frank Miller
is coming back on a noon train.

422
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,436
I need all the specialdeputies I can get.

423
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,835
Well, what are we waiting for?

424
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,511
Let's go.

425
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,749
Hold it a minute, hold it!

426
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,758
Before we rush out into something
that isn't so pleasant,

427
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,713
let's make sure we know
what this is all about.

428
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,549
What I want to know is this: ain't it true
that Kane ain't no longer a marshal?

429
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,549
And that there's personal trouble
with Kane and Miller?

430
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,909
All right, allright!
Quiet, everybody!

431
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,112
If there's a difference of opinion,
let everybody have a say.

432
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,518
But let's do it like grown-up people,
and get the kids out of the building.

433
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,599
- Anything on the train?
- It's on time as far as I know, sir.

434
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,031
It don't really matter if there's anything
personal between Miller and Kane.

435
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,800
We all know who Miller is,
and what Miller is.

436
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,835
- We're wasting time.
- All right Coy!

437
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,149
We all know who Miller is
and we put him away once.

438
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,716
And who saved him from hanging?
The politicians up north.

439
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,469
I say, this is their mess.
Let them take care of it.

440
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,955
- Fryer?
- Well, I say this:

441
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,436
We've been paying good money
for a marshal and deputies.

442
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,394
The first time there's any trouble,
we're supposed to take care of it ourselves.

443
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,556
What have we been paying for
all this time?

444
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,116
We're not peace officers,
and this ain't our job!

445
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,233
I've been saying right along,
we ought to have more deputies.

446
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,069
If we did, we wouldn't be facing this now.

447
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,909
Just a minute, just a minute!
Everybody, quiet!

448
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,873
Keep it orderly.
You had your hand up.

449
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,229
I can't believe I've heard
some of the things said here.

450
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,192
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

451
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,756
We paid this man,
and he was the best marshal we ever had.

452
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,030
It ain't his trouble, it's ours.

453
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,232
If we don't do what's right,
we're gonna have more trouble.

454
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,399
There ain't but one thing to do,
and you all know what that is.

455
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,876
- Go ahead, Kibbee.
- This thing has been handled wrong.

456
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,072
Those three killers
walking the streets bold as brass...

457
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,716
Why didn't you put them in jail
where they ought to be?

458
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,514
Then we'd only have Miller to worry about.

459
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,713
I haven't anything to arrest them for.
They haven't done anything.

460
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,593
There's no law against them
sitting on a bench at the depot.

461
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,473
I can't listen to any more of this.
What's the matter with you people?

462
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,673
Remember when a decent woman
couldn't walk down the street in broad daylight?

463
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,111
When this wasn't a fit place
to bring up a child?

464
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,949
How can you sit and talk, and talk,
and talk like this?

465
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,551
What are we getting so excited about?
How do we know Miller's on that train?

466
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:06,075
We can be pretty sure he's on it.
Time's getting short.

467
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,792
- Parson, you got anything to say?
- I don't know.

468
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,753
The commandment says
''thou shalt not kill''

469
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,594
but we hire men to do it for us.

470
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,031
The right and the wrong
seem pretty clear here,

471
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,879
but if I should tell my people
to go out and kill,

472
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:31,191
and maybe get themselves killed, I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

473
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,315
All right, I'll say this.

474
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:39,548
What this town owes Will Kane, it can never
pay with money. Don't forget it.

475
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,594
He's the best marshal we've ever had,
and maybe the best we'll ever have.

476
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:48,316
So if Miller comes back here today,
it's our problem, not his.

477
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,478
It's our problem
because this is our town.

478
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,955
We made it with our own hands,
out of nothing.

479
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:58,472
If we want to keep it decent
we gotta think mighty clear today.

480
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,117
We gotta have the courage to do what is right,
no matter how hard it is.

481
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:08,030
All right! There's gonna be fighting
when Kane and Miller meet.

482
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,357
And somebody's going to get hurt,
that's for sure.

483
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:16,190
Now... People up north
are thinking about this town.

484
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:22,589
Thinking about sending money down here,
to put up stores and factories.

485
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,076
It would mean a lot to this town, an awful lot,

486
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:32,276
but if they'll read about shooting in the streets,
what are they going to think?

487
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,235
I'll tell you. They'll think
this is just another wide-open town,

488
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,034
and everything we worked for
will be wiped out.

489
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,155
In one day, this town
will be sat back five years,

490
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,999
and I don't think we can let that happen.

491
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,909
Mind you, you all know
how I feel about this man.

492
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:57,194
He's a mighty brave man, a good man.
He didn't have to come back today.

493
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:03,108
And for his sake, and a sake of this town,
I wish he hadn't.

494
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,595
Because if he's not here when Miller comes,

495
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,917
my hunch is,
there won't be any trouble, not one bit.

496
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:14,035
Tomorrow we'll have a new marshal
and if we offer him our services,

497
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,435
I think we can handle anything
that comes along.

498
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:22,236
To me that makes sense.
To me that's the only way out of this.

499
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:28,238
Will, I think you better go
while there's still time.

500
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,951
It's better for you and...it's better for us.

501
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,639
Thanks.

502
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,230
Why don't you put that thing away?

503
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,950
- Bang, bang, bang!
- You're dead, Kane.

504
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,237
I just sent the kid to find you.
Didn't he come?

505
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,034
He was here.

506
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,278
You've been my friend all my life.
You got me this job.

507
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,153
You made them send for me.

508
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,670
Ever since I was a kid
I wanted to be like you, Mart.

509
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:37,716
- You've been a law man all your life.
- Yeah, all my life. It's a great life.

510
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,878
You risk your skin catching killers,
and the juries turn them loose,

511
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,719
so they can come back
and shoot at you again.

512
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,639
If you're honest,
you're poor your whole life.

513
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,958
In the end you wind up dying all alone
on some dirty street.

514
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:56,188
For what?
For nothing. For a tin star.

515
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,349
The judge's left town, Harvey's quit,
and I'm having trouble getting deputies.

516
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,552
It figures. It's all happened too sudden.

517
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,356
People got to talk themselves into law and order
before they do anything.

518
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:14,395
Maybe because down deep they don't care.
They just don't care.

519
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,189
What'll I do, Mart?

520
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,960
I was hopin' you wouldn't come back

521
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,676
- You know why I came back
- But not to commit suicide.

522
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,395
Sometimes... Sometimes
prison changes a man.

523
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:41,435
Not him. This is all planned,
that's why they're all here.

524
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,313
Get out, Will! Get out.

525
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,356
Will you come down
to that depot with me?

526
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,835
No.

527
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,237
You know how I feel about you,
but I ain't goin' with you.

528
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,956
Seems like a man with busted knuckles
didn't need arthritis, don't it?

529
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,876
No, I couldn't do nothin' for you.

530
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:17,790
You'd get yourself killed
worryin' about me.

531
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,116
It's too one-sided like it is.

532
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,040
- So long, Martin.
- So long.

533
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,718
It's all for nothin', Will.
It's all for nothin'.

534
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,158
Excuse me, what is
Mrs Ramirez's room number?

535
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,960
- Three.
- Thank you.

536
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,274
 Come in.

537
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,877
- Yes?
- Mrs Ramirez? I'm Mrs Kane.

538
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,116
I know.

539
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,676
- May I come in?
- If you like.

540
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,152
- Sit down, Mrs Kane.
- No, thank you.

541
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,316
- What do you want?
- Please...

542
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,637
I'm afraid that if I sat down,
I wouldn't be able to get up again.

543
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,832
- Why?
- It wasn't easy for me to come here.

544
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,191
- Why?
- Look, Mrs Ramirez...

545
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,757
Will and I were married an hour ago.
We were ready to leave...

546
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,235
...then this thing happened
and he wouldn't go.

547
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:59,468
I did everything. I pleaded, I threatened,
I just couldn't reach him.

548
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:04,231
- And now?
- That man downstairs, the clerk..

549
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,159
He said things about you and Will

550
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,920
I've tried to understand
why he wouldn't go with me,

551
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,032
and it's got to be because of you.

552
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,399
- What do you want from me?
- Let him go.

553
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,795
He still has a chance. Let him go.

554
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,515
- I can't help you.
- Please.

555
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,950
He isn't staying for me.

556
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,835
I haven't spoken to him for a year,
until today.

557
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,516
- I'm leaving on the same train you are.
- Then why is he staying?

558
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,149
If you don't know,
I can't explain it to you.

559
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,676
Thank you anyway.
You've been very kind.

560
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,197
What kind of woman are you?
How can you leave him like this?

561
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,994
Does the sound of guns
frighten you that much?

562
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,397
No, Mrs Ramirez. I've heard guns.

563
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,558
My father and my brother
were killed by guns.

564
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,958
They were on the right side, but that
didn't help them when the shooting started..

565
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,789
My brother was 19. I watched him die.

566
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:16,993
That's when I became a Quaker.
I don't care who's right or who's wrong.

567
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,079
There's got to be some better way
for people to live.

568
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,391
Will knows how I feel about it.

569
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,878
Just a minute.
Are you going to wait for the train downstairs?

570
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,436
- Yes.
- Why don't you wait here?

571
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,470
I've got no use for Kane,
but he's got guts.

572
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,478
You're mighty broadminded, Joe.

573
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:04,751
I always figured you had guts, but
I never gave you credit for brains until now.

574
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,475
What does that mean?

575
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,752
It takes a smart man
to know when to back away.

576
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,549
If I can't pick my company when I drink,
I ain't coming in here anymore.

577
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:25,436
Okay... All right
The boy with a tin star.

578
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,388
Put a saddle on him, Kane.
Go on, saddle him up.

579
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,830
He'd go a long way before he tires.

580
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,349
- You were thinking that.
- Kind of.

581
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,269
- You're scared?
- I guess so.

582
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,669
Sure. Stands to reason.

583
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,433
Come on. Let me help you.

584
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,391
Seems like everybody
wants to get me out of town.

585
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,717
Nobody wants to see you get killed.

586
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,115
- Where're you going?
- Back to the office, I guess.

587
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,278
Oh, no. You're getting on that horse
and getting out.

588
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,671
What's the matter with you?
You were ready to do it yourself.

589
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,555
Look, Harv. I thought about it
because I was tired.

590
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,514
You think about a lot of things
when you're tired. I can't do it.

591
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,871
- Why?
- I don't know.

592
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,389
Get on that horse, Will!

593
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,153
Why is this so important?
You don't care if I live or die.

594
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:03,840
- Come on.
- Don't shove me. I'm tired of being shoved.

595
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:52,472
I hate this town.
I've always hated it.

596
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,831
To be a Mexican woman
in a town Like this...

597
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:00,238
- I understand.
- You do?

598
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:05,514
That's good. I don't understand you,
no matter what you say.

599
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:09,349
If Kane was my man,
I'd never leave him. I'd get a gun.

600
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,790
- I'd fight
- Why don't you?

601
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,353
He's not my man. He's yours.

602
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:41,878
- You have some clean water?
- Why, sure, marshal sit down.

603
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:53,998
- Running some kind of trouble?
- No, not trouble.

604
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,910
-   

605
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,351
- What're you building?
- Just fixing things.

606
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,791
Now, take it easy. Settle back, that's it.

607
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:12,112
Fred, Fred! Hold it awhile.
Stop 'til I tell you to start again.

608
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,828
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, marshal

609
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,158
- Oh, no...
- Tell your man he can go back to work now.

610
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,556
- Will!
- I guess I forgot about you, Herb.

611
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:11,311
- I'm sure glad you're here.
- Time's getting pretty short.

612
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,353
- Sure is.
- When are the other boys coming?

613
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,915
- We gotta make plans.
- The other boys?

614
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,953
There aren't any others
It's just you and me.

615
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:24,392
- You're joking.
- No, I couldn't get anybody.

616
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,672
I don't believe it!
This town ain't that low.

617
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,634
- I couldn't get anybody.
- Then it's just you and me.

618
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:35,150
- I guess so.
- You and me against all of them?

619
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,077
- That's right. Do you want out, Hern?
- Well..

620
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,510
It isn't that I want out, no. You see...

621
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:50,077
- I didn't figure on anything like this.
- Neither did I.

622
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,511
I volunteered, you know I did.
I was ready.

623
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:59,078
I...I'm ready now, but this ain't like
what you said it was gonna be.

624
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,670
This is just committing suicide.
I'm no law man.

625
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,190
I just live here.
I got nothing personal against nobody.

626
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,029
- I got no stake in this.
- I guess not.

627
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:15,237
There's a limit how much you can ask a man.
What about my kids?

628
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,790
Go on home to your kids, Herb.

629
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,718
You get some of the other fellows,
and I go through with it.

630
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,957
Go on home, Herb.

631
01:06:55,320 --> 01:07:01,236
- What do you want?
- I found them, all but Mr Henderson.

632
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,194
- I found him. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

633
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,395
Marshal, let me fight with you.
I ain't afraid.

634
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,555
- No.
- Please, let me, marshal!

635
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,558
- You're a kid, you're a baby.
- I'm 16!

636
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,231
- I can handle a gun, too.
- You're 14. What do you wanna lie for?

637
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:25,750
I'm big for my ago. Please, marshal!

638
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:30,590
Well, you're big for your age,
but no, go on, get out of here.

639
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,915
-

640
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,429
-

641
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,597
-

642
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:34,313
-

643
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:43,271
Hey, Charlie. You can go home now.

644
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,868
Thanks, marshal!

645
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,917
Sure appreciate it. Certainly do.

646
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,278
You don't happen to know
if the saloon's open?

647
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:05,278
- I said, go home, Charlie.
- Yes, sir.

648
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,554
- So long, Helen.
- Goodbye, Sam.

649
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,716
Take care.

650
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,434
-

651
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,470
-

652
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,555
- Hello, Frank.
- How are you, Frank?

653
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,710
- Everything ready?
- Just the way you wanted.

654
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,357
- We've got your gun over here.
- Let's get started then.

655
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,316
- Can't you wait?
- Just wanna be ready.

656
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,952
Miller!

657
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:43,999
-

658
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:09,078
-   

659
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:44,437
-

660
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,552
-

661
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:53,996
Kane, come on out...or your friend
will get it the way Pierce did.

662
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,555
I'll come out, let her go.

663
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,991
As you soon as you walk through that door.
I'll hold my fire.

664
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,835
# Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

665
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:57,878
# You made that promise when we wed

666
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,753
# Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

667
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:11,716
# Although you''re grievin',
I can't be leavin'

668
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:16,630
# Until I shoot Frank Miller dead

669
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:24,272
# Wait along, wait along
