1
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,007
It is a beautiful day in Chicago.
Temperatures in the upper 70's.

2
00:00:23,217 --> 00:00:29,550
Right now, 75 at the lakefront,
74 at Midway, 73 at O'Hare.

3
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:38,146
Tom!

4
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:44,151
- What's the matter?
- It's Ferris Look at him

5
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,408
Ferris?

6
00:00:50,828 --> 00:00:54,528
He doesn't have a fever, but his
stomach hurts and he's seeing spots

7
00:00:54,748 --> 00:00:58,696
- What's the matter, Ferris?
- Papa?

8
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:02,915
Feel his hands,
they're cold and clammy

9
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:11,095
- I'm fine I'll get up
- No!

10
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:14,554
- I have a test today
- No

11
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:20,140
I must take it I want to go to a good
college, so I can have a fruitful life

12
00:01:20,357 --> 00:01:23,725
Honey, you're not
going to school like this

13
00:01:23,944 --> 00:01:29,566
- What's his problem?
- He doesn't feel well

14
00:01:29,784 --> 00:01:31,657
Dry that one out,
you can fertilise the lawn

15
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:36,078
Jeanie, is that you?

16
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,908
I can't see that far Jeanie?

17
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:43,910
Jeanie, I

18
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:51,424
- Bite the big one, junior
- Jeanie, you get to school

19
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:56,762
If I was bleeding out my eyes, you'd
make me go to school It's so unfair

20
00:01:56,976 --> 00:02:04,520
Jeanie, don't be upset with me
You have your health, be thankful

21
00:02:06,903 --> 00:02:11,314
That's it! I want out of this family

22
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:20,037
I'm okay I'll just sleep
I'll have an aspirin around noon

23
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:24,660
I'm showing some houses
to that family from Vermont today

24
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,422
My office will know just where I am
if you need me

25
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:35,671
- I'll check on you too, pal
- I have such loving, caring parents

26
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:40,681
You're both very special people

27
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:48,608
- You get better, pumpkin
- Okay, pumpkin

28
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,899
I'll be home at six sharp
If you need anything, call

29
00:02:53,116 --> 00:02:55,487
Ringy-dingy

30
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:02,320
- We love you, sweetie
- I love you, too

31
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,039
Call if you need us

32
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:17,387
They bought it

33
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:32,317
Incredible! A terrible performance,
and they never doubted it for a second

34
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:41,072
How could I be expected
to handle school on a day like this?

35
00:03:51,256 --> 00:03:56,082
This is my ninth sick day It's tough
coming up with new illnesses

36
00:03:56,303 --> 00:04:02,174
If I go for ten, I'll have to barf up a lung
So I'd better make this one count

37
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:08,145
The key to faking out the parents
is the clammy hands

38
00:04:08,357 --> 00:04:12,816
It's a good non-specific symptom
I'm a big believer in it

39
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:16,693
A lot of people will tell you
to go for a phoney fever

40
00:04:16,907 --> 00:04:23,525
But if you get a nervous mother, you
could wind up in a doctor's office

41
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:26,367
You fake a stomach cramp

42
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:31,327
When you're bent over wailing,
you lick your palms

43
00:04:31,547 --> 00:04:34,880
It's childish and stupid,
but then, so is high school

44
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:39,464
Life moves pretty fast

45
00:04:41,056 --> 00:04:45,467
If you don't stop and look around
once in a while, you could miss it

46
00:04:47,146 --> 00:04:50,479
I do have a test today,
that wasn't bullshit

47
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:55,102
It's on European socialism
What's the point?

48
00:04:55,321 --> 00:05:00,824
I'm not European, so who
gives a crap if they're socialists?

49
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,900
They could be fascist anarchists,
it still wouldn't buy me a car

50
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,999
I recall Central Park in fall

51
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:16,623
how you tore your dress
what a mess, I confess...

52
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:28,386
It's not that I condone fascism,
or any "ism"

53
00:05:28,603 --> 00:05:34,605
A person should not believe in an
"ism", he should believe in himself

54
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:39,609
I quote John Lennon: "I don't believe
in Beatles I just believe in me"

55
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:43,571
A good point there
After all, he was the walrus

56
00:05:43,785 --> 00:05:47,781
I could be the walrus,
I'd still have to bum rides off people

57
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:50,666
Adams
Adamly

58
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:55,786
- Here
- Adamowlsky, Adamson

59
00:05:56,006 --> 00:05:59,421
- Adler
- Here

60
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:04,093
- Anderson Anderson?
- Here

61
00:06:04,306 --> 00:06:06,428
Bueller

62
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:10,175
Bueller

63
00:06:10,395 --> 00:06:14,060
Bueller Bueller

64
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:21,355
He's sick My best friend's sister's
boyfriend's brother's girlfriend -

65
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:25,900
- saw Ferris pass out at 31 Flavours
last night I guess it's pretty serious

66
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:30,067
- Thank you, Simone
- No problem whatsoever

67
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,779
Frye

68
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,874
Frye Frye

69
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:48,550
- Hello?
- Cameron, what's happening?

70
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:54,135
- Very little
- How do you feel?

71
00:06:54,355 --> 00:06:57,521
- Shredded
- Is your mother in the room?

72
00:06:57,734 --> 00:07:01,600
She's in Decatur
Unfortunately she's not staying

73
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:08,192
- Where are you?
- I'm taking the day off, come on over

74
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:11,910
- I can't, stupid, I'm sick.
- That's all in your head

75
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:16,867
- Come on over.
- I feel like shit I can't go anywhere

76
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:23,040
I'm sorry to hear that
Now come on over and pick me up

77
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:35,302
I'm dying

78
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:44,018
You're not dying. Youjust
can't think of anything good to do.

79
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:49,151
Cameron really needs a day off

80
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:55,536
He has a lot of things to sort out
before he goes to college

81
00:07:55,749 --> 00:08:02,914
When Cameron was in Egypt's land

82
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:07,377
let my Cameron go.

83
00:08:07,594 --> 00:08:10,594
Cameron is so tight -

84
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:14,008
- that a lump of coal stuck up his ass
would turn into a diamond

85
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:25,358
- Katie Bueller
- Edward Rooney, Dean of Students.

86
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:31,858
I'm so sorry
I completely forgot to call

87
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:38,114
- You know your son isn't in school?
- Yes. Ferris is home sick.

88
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:43,955
I had a meeting this morning.
I forgot to call. I'm very sorry.

89
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:47,173
Are you also aware -

90
00:08:47,385 --> 00:08:52,509
- that Ferris does not have
an exemplary attendance record.

91
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:54,181
What?

92
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:58,009
He has missed an unacceptable
number of school days.

93
00:08:58,229 --> 00:09:02,012
Ferris is not taking
his academic growth seriously.

94
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:06,893
I've spent my morning
examining his records

95
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:13,945
If Ferris thinks he can coast through
to graduation, he is sorely mistaken

96
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:17,245
I have no reservation whatsoever-

97
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:21,618
- about holding him back
another year

98
00:09:21,835 --> 00:09:26,246
- This is all news to me
- It usually is

99
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:33,048
- He has been absent nine times
- Nine times?

100
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:37,508
- Nine times
- He hasn't been sick nine times

101
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:43,015
That's probably because he
wasn't sick, he was skipping school

102
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:45,983
Wake up and smell the coffee

103
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:49,976
It's a fool's paradise He's leading
you down the primrose path

104
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:54,193
- I can't believe it.
- It's right here in front of me

105
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:56,733
He has missed nine days

106
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:09,748
I asked for a car I got a computer
How's that for being born unlucky?

107
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:15,338
Grace!

108
00:10:17,223 --> 00:10:21,634
Mr Rooney, Ferris is home
and he is very ill

109
00:10:21,853 --> 00:10:26,098
- I debated even leaving him.
- Grace!

110
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:30,099
At this time of year, children
are prone to taking the day off

111
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,696
But I can assure you
that Ferris is a very sick boy

112
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:43,074
Never had one lesson

113
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:52,419
In 1930 the House of Representatives,
in an effort to alleviate the effects of

114
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:54,257
Anyone?

115
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:00,258
The Great Depression
Passed the anyone?

116
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:04,851
The Holly-Smoot Tariff Act

117
00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:08,099
Which raised or lowered?

118
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:13,985
Raised tariffs in an effort to collect
more government revenue

119
00:11:14,196 --> 00:11:18,572
Did it work?
Anyone know the effects?

120
00:11:18,784 --> 00:11:23,195
It did not work and the United States
sank deeper into the Depression

121
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:28,371
Today, we have a similar debate
over this Anyone know what this is?

122
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:32,629
Anyone seen this before?

123
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,674
The Laffer curve
Anyone know what this says?

124
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:40,213
It says that at this point
on the revenue curve -

125
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:45,507
- you will get exactly the same
amount of revenue as at this point

126
00:11:45,728 --> 00:11:50,934
Does anyone know
what Bush called this in 1980?

127
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:57,651
Anyone? Something-doo economics
Voodoo economics

128
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:13,335
Jeanie, I'm really sorry
about your brother

129
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:16,216
What are you sorry for?
I have to live with him

130
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:21,002
- I heard he's really sick
- Who said he's sick?

131
00:12:21,222 --> 00:12:24,341
A bunch of people
say he's close to death

132
00:12:24,558 --> 00:12:30,595
I heard that if Ferris dies, he's
giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder

133
00:12:30,814 --> 00:12:34,562
He's such a sweetie Got to go

134
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:37,776
- Hi, Jeanie
- Shut up

135
00:12:37,988 --> 00:12:41,107
How desperate is the situation?

136
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:44,111
Did you see "Alien"?

137
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:48,028
When the creature
was in that guy's stomach?

138
00:12:48,248 --> 00:12:51,414
It feels like that
Freshman

139
00:12:51,628 --> 00:12:56,538
- Are you kidding?
- Do I sound like I'm kidding?

140
00:12:56,757 --> 00:13:00,587
- It's Ferris Bueller
- He got me out of summer school

141
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:05,796
We appreciate you letting us
know how you're doing.

142
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:10,808
I hope he doesn't die
I can't handle summer school

143
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:15,932
- Give me somebody else
- Sure, hold on

144
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:20,194
- Did you see "Alien"?
- Yeah, why?

145
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:24,614
Hello? Hi, Ferris, how's your bod?

146
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:28,195
You're dying?

147
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:36,830
- Is it serious?
- I hope not

148
00:13:37,047 --> 00:13:41,957
- I may need a kidney transplant
- Shit! Are you upset?

149
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:46,168
- Excuse me
- Will you be alive this weekend?

150
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:50,516
- Yeah, I'd say so
- Great Maybe I'll see you

151
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:10,162
I don't trust this kid
any further than I can throw him

152
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:17,252
With your bad knee, Ed,
you shouldn't throw anybody It's true

153
00:14:17,462 --> 00:14:23,131
What is so dangerous about him
is that he gives good kids bad ideas

154
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:30,389
The last thing I need is 1,500 Bueller
disciples running around these halls

155
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,218
He jeopardises my ability
to govern this student body

156
00:14:34,437 --> 00:14:40,973
- He makes you look like an ass
- Thank you, but you're wrong

157
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:43,980
He's very popular

158
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:48,691
Sportoes, motorheads, geeks,
sluts, bloods, wasteoids, -

159
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,820
- dweebies, dickheads,
they all adore him

160
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:59,001
That is why I have got to catch him

161
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:04,122
To show these kids that his example
is a first-class ticket to nowhere

162
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:08,919
Ed! You sounded
like Dirty Harry just then

163
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:13,052
Really?

164
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:18,557
Thanks, Grace

165
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:24,395
- You can't make me wait like this
- Let me rot in peace.

166
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:31,362
It's my ninth sick day If I get caught,
I won't graduate I'm doing this for you

167
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:35,787
- Do you know what my diastolic is?
- Take some Pepto Bismal

168
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:39,581
- Get dressed and come on over
- Shut up

169
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:46,460
Hold your water for a second
I've got another call Hello?

170
00:15:46,676 --> 00:15:53,971
- Ferris. You sound terrible.
- Darn, I thought I was improving.

171
00:15:54,183 --> 00:15:57,682
- Were you sleeping?
- Dad, can you hang on for a second?

172
00:15:57,895 --> 00:16:00,848
- Sure, pal
- Hang on

173
00:16:01,065 --> 00:16:04,813
- Cameron, it's my dad
- Great Keep me out of it

174
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:11,065
If you're not over here in 15 minutes,
you can find a new best friend

175
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:18,245
Dad, all this talking has made me
kind of light-headed

176
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:24,044
- I think I ought to lie down
- Wrap a hot towel round your head

177
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:32,083
- Wrap a hot towel round my head?
- Make some soup, then get a nap

178
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:36,715
- Ferris, I love you, pal
- I love you, too

179
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:45,605
I bet Cameron is sitting in his car
debating whether or not to go out

180
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:53,857
He'll keep calling me until I come over

181
00:16:54,075 --> 00:16:57,111
He'll make me feel guilty

182
00:16:57,328 --> 00:17:00,910
This is ridiculous I'll go I'll go

183
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,576
I'll go Shit!

184
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:13,342
Goddammit!

185
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:26,016
Forget it That's it

186
00:17:44,084 --> 00:17:50,287
In what way

187
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:58,338
does the author's
use of the prison

188
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:05,308
symbolise

189
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:16,147
the protagonist's struggle?

190
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:19,782
And how does this relate -

191
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:25,498
- to our discussion
of the uses of irony?

192
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:30,833
Mr Nolan, may I interrupt, please?

193
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:42,011
Sloane Peterson,
may I have a word with you, dear?

194
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:47,562
I'm afraid that I am the bearer
of bad tidings

195
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:52,813
Your father called
Your grandmother has just passed

196
00:18:55,113 --> 00:19:00,948
- No
- Oh, darling! Honey

197
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,868
- Dead grandmother?
- That's what Mr Peterson said

198
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:10,079
I had Florence Sparrow
notify the poor little lamb

199
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:15,455
- Who is this girl going out with?
- It's so hard to tell these days

200
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:20,466
I do see her with Ferris Bueller
quite a bit

201
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:25,009
Would you get me
Mr Peterson's daytime number?

202
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:31,682
- Ed Rooney's Office
- This is George Peterson.

203
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,644
Please hold
What do you know, it's Mr Peterson

204
00:19:36,863 --> 00:19:40,196
Do you still want
his daytime number?

205
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:48,283
- Ed Rooney
- Ed, this is George Peterson.

206
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,410
- How are you today, sir?
- Well, we've had a bit of bad luck.

207
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:58,835
Yeah, I heard I'm all broken up
Boy, what a blow

208
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:02,917
Yeah, it's been a tough morning.

209
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:05,807
We've got a lot of family business.

210
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:09,799
If you wouldn't mind excusing Sloane,
I'd appreciate it.

211
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:12,772
Sure, I'd be happy to

212
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:17,477
You just produce a corpse,
and I'll release Sloane

213
00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:21,444
I want to see this dead grandmother
first-hand

214
00:20:21,658 --> 00:20:26,899
It's all right, it's Ferris Bueller
I'm setting a trap for him

215
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,451
Ed, I'm sorry, did you say
you wanted to see a body?

216
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:39,292
Yeah, roll her old bones over here
and I'll dig up your daughter

217
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:43,126
That's school policy
Was this your mother?

218
00:20:43,345 --> 00:20:47,093
No, my wife's mother.

219
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:53,345
- Ed Rooney's Office
- This is Ferris Bueller for Mr Rooney

220
00:20:56,734 --> 00:20:59,189
Hold

221
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:03,613
I'll tell you what, dipshit,
if you don't like my policies, -

222
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:08,485
- you can come down here
and smooch my big old white butt

223
00:21:08,704 --> 00:21:13,578
- Pucker up, Buttercup What?
- Ferris Bueller is on line two

224
00:21:24,678 --> 00:21:29,884
Mr Rooney,
I'm not feeling very well today.

225
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:35,260
Could my sister bring home
any assignments from my classes?

226
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:38,232
Have a nice day.

227
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:57,615
Mr Peterson
I think I owe you an apology

228
00:21:57,836 --> 00:22:02,331
- I should say you do
- I

229
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:05,633
I think you should be sorry,
for Christ's sake

230
00:22:05,844 --> 00:22:10,054
A family member dies and you
insult me! What's wrong with you?

231
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:14,307
Well I really don't know

232
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,853
I didn't think I was talking to you.

233
00:22:18,065 --> 00:22:25,727
You know that I would never
deliberately insult you like that

234
00:22:25,948 --> 00:22:30,988
Pardon my French,
but you're an asshole! Asshole!

235
00:22:31,203 --> 00:22:36,160
You're absolutely right, sir
Find out where she is

236
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:40,870
- This isn't over yet Do you read me?
- Loud and clear, Mr Peterson

237
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:45,379
- Call me sir, goddammit!
- Yes, sir

238
00:22:45,592 --> 00:22:47,797
That's better.

239
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:52,304
You mind your P's and Q's,
and remember who you're dealing with

240
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:56,049
Bueller Ferris Bueller

241
00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:00,597
I'm scared
What if he recognises my voice?

242
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:04,183
Impossible You're doing great

243
00:23:11,117 --> 00:23:16,110
Rooney!
Rooney, calm down

244
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:24,205
- Just a moment
- Just a little office difficulty

245
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:30,009
I don't have all day to bark at you,
so I'm going to make this short

246
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:36,507
I want my daughter out
in front of the school by herself

247
00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:39,597
- What?
- That's too suspicious

248
00:23:39,813 --> 00:23:42,184
- Talk
- You!

249
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:50,102
- Talk!
- Rooney! Pay attention

250
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:55,363
I want you out there with her
I want a few words with you

251
00:23:58,664 --> 00:24:03,621
We don't have time to talk right now
We'll get together over lunch

252
00:24:03,837 --> 00:24:08,379
- What's wrong with you?
- Wait!

253
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:13,381
- Where's your brain?
- Why did you kick me?

254
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:20,309
How can we pick up Sloane
if Rooney is there with her?

255
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,228
I said for her to be there alone
and you freaked

256
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:30,652
I didn't hit you
I lightly slapped you

257
00:24:30,864 --> 00:24:33,568
You hit me

258
00:24:35,743 --> 00:24:42,195
Don't ask me to participate in your crap
if you don't like the way I do it

259
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:45,287
You make me get out of bed
and come here

260
00:24:45,503 --> 00:24:50,080
You make me make a phoney call
to Edward Rooney

261
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:53,833
The man could squash my nuts

262
00:24:54,053 --> 00:24:56,804
- And you deliberately hurt my feelings
- No

263
00:24:57,014 --> 00:25:03,347
I did not deliberately
hurt your feelings I didn't

264
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:09,893
- What are you doing?
- See you later I'm going home

265
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,481
- Have a nice life
- Cameron, wait a minute

266
00:25:12,697 --> 00:25:19,826
I didn't mean to lose my temper
I'm sorry, it was uncalled for

267
00:25:20,037 --> 00:25:23,121
- Seriously?
- Yeah

268
00:25:30,423 --> 00:25:35,712
- Here you go
- Thank you

269
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:38,929
You did screw up though, right?

270
00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:47,097
- Not that it was completely your fault
- Why?

271
00:25:47,315 --> 00:25:53,648
To fix the situation, I'm going
to have to ask you for a favour

272
00:26:11,755 --> 00:26:16,665
The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California

273
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:23,057
Less than a hundred were made

274
00:26:23,266 --> 00:26:27,393
My father spent
three years restoring this car

275
00:26:27,605 --> 00:26:31,139
It is his love It is his passion

276
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:35,401
It is his fault
he didn't lock the garage

277
00:26:35,613 --> 00:26:39,858
Ferris, what are you talking about?

278
00:26:42,077 --> 00:26:44,484
My father loves this car more than life

279
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:50,742
A man with such priorities
doesn't deserve this fine automobile

280
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,412
No

281
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:58,587
Apparently you don't understand

282
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:03,842
He never drives it
He just rubs it with a diaper

283
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:08,883
Remember how insane he went
when I broke my retainer?

284
00:27:09,104 --> 00:27:12,140
That was a piece of plastic
This is a Ferrari

285
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:19,605
We can't pick up Sloane in your car

286
00:27:19,822 --> 00:27:22,822
Mr Rooney would never believe
Mr Peterson drives that piece of shit

287
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:27,326
- It's not a piece of shit
- It is

288
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:32,959
Don't worry I don't even have
a piece of shit I have to envy yours

289
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:38,543
I'm sorry
There's nothing else we can do

290
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:53,270
- He knows the mileage
- He doesn't trust you?

291
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:57,976
- Never has, never will
- This is real simple

292
00:27:58,194 --> 00:28:01,894
Whatever miles we put on,
we'll take off

293
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:05,649
- We'll drive home backwards
- No

294
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:12,534
No, Ferris, forget it
I'm putting my foot down

295
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:17,707
How about we rent a nice Cadillac?
My treat

296
00:28:17,922 --> 00:28:24,540
We could call a limo
A stretch job with a TV and a bar

297
00:28:28,557 --> 00:28:31,557
Come on, live a little

298
00:28:34,356 --> 00:28:38,483
Let me tell you how deeply saddened
I am by your loss

299
00:28:38,694 --> 00:28:43,520
I had a grandmother once
Two, actually

300
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:52,491
"Man hath but a short time to live
and is full of misery"

301
00:28:52,707 --> 00:28:56,289
"He cometh up
and is cut down like a flower"

302
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:59,751
"He fleeth as if it were a shadow -

303
00:28:59,964 --> 00:29:03,297
- and never continueth in one stay"

304
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:07,174
Oh, dear

305
00:29:10,557 --> 00:29:15,134
Between grief and nothing,
I'll take grief

306
00:29:17,065 --> 00:29:19,555
Great

307
00:29:26,907 --> 00:29:32,991
Sloane, dear, hurry along now

308
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:38,282
I guess that's my dad
I've got to go

309
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:45,131
Mr Rooney Ed

310
00:29:45,343 --> 00:29:48,676
- You're a beautiful man
- Thank you

311
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:55,340
I want to thank you
for your warmth and compassion

312
00:30:02,193 --> 00:30:05,727
Shit!

313
00:30:05,946 --> 00:30:10,939
- Do you have a kiss for Daddy?
- Are you kidding?

314
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:24,711
So that's how it is in their family

315
00:30:28,552 --> 00:30:34,340
- Hi, Cameron, are you comfortable?
- Hi, Sloane No

316
00:30:36,227 --> 00:30:42,145
- What are we going to do?
- What aren't we going to do?

317
00:30:42,358 --> 00:30:46,058
Don't say
we're not going to take the car home

318
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:51,615
If you had access to a car like this,
would you take it back right away?

319
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:54,446
Neither would I

320
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:28,606
Ferris, don't go so fast

321
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,001
Save Ferris
God bless you You're very generous

322
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:37,171
Save Ferris Bueller

323
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,463
- Save Ferris?
- What?

324
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:45,267
We're collecting money
to buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney

325
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,480
- Go piss up a flagpole
- I'm sorry?

326
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:52,060
- You should be
- Hey!

327
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:56,357
What if you need a favour someday
from Ferris Bueller?

328
00:32:56,574 --> 00:33:01,911
Peterson home on line one
Watch your mouth this time

329
00:33:02,122 --> 00:33:05,621
Go suck your hat

330
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:12,037
We can't come to the phone now.
We've had a death in the family.

331
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:17,497
Ferris Bueller is behind this,
there is no doubt in my mind

332
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:21,764
- Now Sloane Peterson is involved
- Her grandmother, too

333
00:33:21,974 --> 00:33:24,381
You pinhead

334
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:29,144
If you need to reach us,
we'll be at the following number.

335
00:33:36,113 --> 00:33:41,486
I did not achieve my position by having
a punk leave my cheese in the wind

336
00:33:41,702 --> 00:33:47,157
You have reached
the Carlton Brothers Mortuary.

337
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:51,703
If you leave your name and number,
we'll get back to you.

338
00:33:56,258 --> 00:34:01,251
Something is going on,
and I'm going to find out what it is

339
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:05,551
I'm going to catch this kid
and put a dent in his future

340
00:34:05,768 --> 00:34:10,892
15 years from now, when he looks back
on the ruin his life has become, -

341
00:34:11,107 --> 00:34:14,309
- he will remember Edward Rooney

342
00:34:35,547 --> 00:34:38,120
- Wrong
- What?

343
00:34:38,341 --> 00:34:42,089
Not here
We're not leaving the car here

344
00:34:42,303 --> 00:34:46,133
- Why not?
- I want the car home where it belongs

345
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,015
- Let's go
- What can happen in a garage?

346
00:34:50,229 --> 00:34:55,982
It could get wrecked, stolen,
scratched, breathed on wrong

347
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:59,693
- A pigeon could shit on it
- Calm down

348
00:34:59,906 --> 00:35:02,443
I'll give the guy a fiver to watch it

349
00:35:02,658 --> 00:35:05,777
What guy?

350
00:35:10,582 --> 00:35:16,417
Hey, how are you doing?
You speak English?

351
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:20,626
What country do you think this is?

352
00:35:20,842 --> 00:35:25,835
Okay, I want you to take
extra special care of this vehicle

353
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:28,724
No problem Trust me

354
00:35:28,934 --> 00:35:34,354
- Sir
- Come on

355
00:35:45,116 --> 00:35:48,069
Relax

356
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:58,211
You have nothing to worry about
I'm a professional

357
00:35:58,421 --> 00:36:01,789
A professional what?

358
00:36:09,974 --> 00:36:13,473
See what a finski
can do to a guy's attitude?

359
00:36:13,686 --> 00:36:17,351
Come on

360
00:37:32,181 --> 00:37:37,091
Bless his little heart

361
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,020
Nine times.

362
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,986
- You think the car's all right?
- Sure

363
00:38:36,203 --> 00:38:40,246
- This is the world's tallest building
- I don't feel too good

364
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:47,158
Here, climb up on this

365
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:52,089
Come on, everybody Cameron

366
00:38:52,302 --> 00:38:57,757
Okay, lean forward
against the glass like this

367
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:02,721
- Oh, my God!
- Isn't that great?

368
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:06,604
The city looks so peaceful
from up here

369
00:39:06,817 --> 00:39:10,647
Anything is peaceful from 1,353 feet

370
00:39:10,863 --> 00:39:17,825
- I think I see my dad
- We've got a lot to do Let's go

371
00:39:18,037 --> 00:39:23,492
Shit! The son of a bitch
is down there somewhere

372
00:39:44,688 --> 00:39:48,021
- You want to get married?
- Sure

373
00:39:48,858 --> 00:39:52,688
Today? I'm serious

374
00:39:52,904 --> 00:39:57,280
- I'm not getting married
- Why not?

375
00:39:57,492 --> 00:40:02,236
- Think about it
- Besides being too young

376
00:40:02,456 --> 00:40:05,160
Having no place to live

377
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:09,041
You being the only cheerleader
with a husband

378
00:40:09,255 --> 00:40:14,081
- Give me one good reason why not?
- Look at my mother and father

379
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:20,133
- They hate each other
- So what?

380
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:26,517
It's like that car
He loves the car, he hates his wife

381
00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:36,648
Thank you

382
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:56,580
Can we please get out of here?
This place gives me the creeps

383
00:40:56,842 --> 00:41:01,087
Why didn't you tell me?

384
00:41:01,305 --> 00:41:04,970
- Hello, may I help you?
- You can sure as hell try

385
00:41:05,185 --> 00:41:10,890
I'm Abe Froman, party of three for 12

386
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:17,111
- Is there a problem?
- You're Abe Froman?

387
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:23,988
- The sausage king of Chicago?
- Yeah, that's me

388
00:41:24,204 --> 00:41:30,704
I'm very busy Why don't you kids
go back to the clubhouse?

389
00:41:30,918 --> 00:41:34,748
Are you suggesting
I'm not who I say I am?

390
00:41:34,964 --> 00:41:40,253
I'm suggesting that you leave
before I have to get snooty

391
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,383
- Okay, Abe, let's go
- I'm not going anywhere

392
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:51,728
- No, we'd like to be seated
- I'm going to have to call the police

393
00:41:51,939 --> 00:41:55,473
- You're going to call the police?
- Yes

394
00:41:55,693 --> 00:42:00,069
- Fine! I'll call them myself
- Yes

395
00:42:00,281 --> 00:42:04,740
Call the police This'll be a hoot

396
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:16,043
Give me the phone
I have another call

397
00:42:16,255 --> 00:42:20,465
You touch me, I yell rat
Find another phone

398
00:42:20,676 --> 00:42:24,258
Wonderful

399
00:42:24,472 --> 00:42:28,599
I weep for the future

400
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:35,227
- Ferris, let it go
- Please, you've gone too far

401
00:42:35,441 --> 00:42:38,560
You're going to get busted

402
00:42:38,777 --> 00:42:44,232
You can never go too far,
and I won't be busted by a guy like that

403
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:48,660
- Come on, Abe!
- Ask for Abe Froman

404
00:42:48,871 --> 00:42:53,282
- Chez Quis?
- May I speak to Abe Froman?

405
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:59,455
- The sausage king of Chicago
- Let me check the restaurant

406
00:42:59,673 --> 00:43:03,421
- Could you describe him for me?
- Leatherjacket

407
00:43:03,635 --> 00:43:06,968
White T-shirt, sweater vest.

408
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,382
Devastatingly handsome

409
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:14,549
- Hold on one moment.
- Thank you

410
00:43:24,823 --> 00:43:28,571
Froman, this is Sergeant Peterson,
Chicago Police.

411
00:43:32,581 --> 00:43:36,329
- I appreciate your understanding
- Don't think twice

412
00:43:36,543 --> 00:43:43,043
Understanding allows people like us
to tolerate a person like yourself

413
00:43:45,803 --> 00:43:48,720
- Thank you
- Don't mention it

414
00:43:51,725 --> 00:43:53,966
Enjoy your luncheon

415
00:43:55,687 --> 00:44:00,431
Darling, you were wonderful

416
00:44:07,532 --> 00:44:13,367
Cameron, you thought we wouldn't
have any fun Shame on you

417
00:44:19,169 --> 00:44:24,410
Maybe I'm overreacting.
Maybe Ferris isn't such a bad guy.

418
00:44:24,633 --> 00:44:28,961
After all, I got a car.
He got a computer.

419
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:35,264
Still, why should he get
to do whatever he wants?

420
00:44:35,477 --> 00:44:38,347
Why should everything
work out for him?

421
00:44:38,563 --> 00:44:41,978
What makes him
so goddam special?

422
00:44:42,192 --> 00:44:43,982
Screw him

423
00:44:44,194 --> 00:44:47,230
I used to think that my family was
the only one with weirdness in it

424
00:44:47,447 --> 00:44:55,987
Then I saw Cameron's family
His home life is really twisted

425
00:44:56,205 --> 00:45:00,071
That's why he's sick all the time
It really bothers him

426
00:45:00,293 --> 00:45:03,875
He feels better when he's sick

427
00:45:04,088 --> 00:45:09,045
If I had to live in that house,
I'd pray for a disease, too

428
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:14,384
The place is like a museum
It's very beautiful and very cold

429
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,517
You're not allowed to touch anything

430
00:45:17,728 --> 00:45:23,267
Can you appreciate what it must
have been like to be there as a baby?

431
00:45:23,483 --> 00:45:31,393
I'm amazed that I got the car out
I caught Cameron digging the ride

432
00:45:31,616 --> 00:45:35,067
It's good for him
It teaches him to deal with his fear

433
00:45:37,372 --> 00:45:40,325
Plus, I must be honest here

434
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:44,124
I love driving it It is so choice

435
00:45:44,337 --> 00:45:49,496
If you have the means,
I highly recommend picking one up

436
00:45:49,717 --> 00:45:52,883
- Thank you
- Yes, sir

437
00:46:04,773 --> 00:46:07,346
Jeanie, who's bothering you now?

438
00:46:07,568 --> 00:46:10,687
- Is Mr Rooney in?
- No, can I help you?

439
00:46:10,905 --> 00:46:15,150
- I doubt it When is he back?
- I don't know

440
00:46:15,368 --> 00:46:19,411
- He's out on personal business
- What's that supposed to mean?

441
00:46:19,623 --> 00:46:23,833
I suppose it means
it's none of your business, young lady

442
00:46:24,043 --> 00:46:27,956
Nice attitude

443
00:46:28,172 --> 00:46:33,331
- Is Mrs Hagel expecting you in class?
- Probably

444
00:46:37,765 --> 00:46:39,887
What an asshole

445
00:46:40,101 --> 00:46:45,011
- Raise your advertising budget
- We don't have the money

446
00:46:45,231 --> 00:46:50,105
If you want to sell, you have
to spend It's as simple as that

447
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,399
4,000 restaurants in the area
I pick the one my father goes to

448
00:46:54,615 --> 00:46:56,986
We're pinched for sure

449
00:46:57,201 --> 00:47:01,577
Only the meek get pinched
The bold survive Let's go

450
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:05,323
- Let's surrender
- Never

451
00:47:09,505 --> 00:47:13,715
Dave, I'm telling you
that it's not the case

452
00:47:13,925 --> 00:47:19,380
- We don't have the money
- Dave, you know what it takes

453
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:25,767
We're going to go heavy on TV
We'll lighten up on radio and print

454
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,980
Come on back to my office

455
00:47:29,191 --> 00:47:32,690
We know you've got the money
We just have to spend it bonehead!

456
00:48:27,124 --> 00:48:30,742
Bueller.

457
00:48:40,429 --> 00:48:45,718
Lesjeux sont faits.
Translation: The game is up

458
00:48:45,934 --> 00:48:49,349
Your ass is mine

459
00:49:15,921 --> 00:49:18,328
Runner at first base, nobody out.

460
00:49:20,051 --> 00:49:28,140
The first hit since the fifth inning,
only the fourth hit in the game.

461
00:49:28,352 --> 00:49:33,262
0 and 2 the count. There's a drive.
Left field.

462
00:49:33,482 --> 00:49:38,522
Twisting into foul territory.

463
00:49:38,736 --> 00:49:44,738
I'm really surprised
they didn't go for it in that inning.

464
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:47,571
- What's the score?
- Nothing-nothing

465
00:49:47,787 --> 00:49:51,452
- Who's winning?
- The Bears

466
00:50:06,764 --> 00:50:11,555
- I think I broke my thumb
- Hey, batter, batter Swing, batter

467
00:50:22,863 --> 00:50:30,240
Do you realise that if we played by
the rules, right now we'd be in gym?

468
00:50:34,668 --> 00:50:40,041
Come on, boys, let's go

469
00:50:40,256 --> 00:50:44,252
We'll never get out of here Move!

470
00:50:51,851 --> 00:50:54,388
I hate him

471
00:51:36,062 --> 00:51:38,517
Who is it?

472
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:47,229
It's Ed Rooney, Ferris
I'd like to have a word with you

473
00:51:47,448 --> 00:51:52,737
I'm sorry, I can't come to the door
right now. In my weakened condition -

474
00:51:52,953 --> 00:51:58,029
- I could take a spill down the stairs
and suffer further school absences.

475
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:02,827
- Save it, Ferris Come down here
- You can reach my parents at work.

476
00:52:03,047 --> 00:52:07,755
Thank you for stopping by.
I appreciate your concern.

477
00:52:07,968 --> 00:52:13,554
- Come down here and talk to me
- Have a nice day.

478
00:52:13,766 --> 00:52:17,015
You're in big trouble

479
00:52:19,104 --> 00:52:21,559
Ferris

480
00:52:21,774 --> 00:52:24,893
Ferris

481
00:52:32,577 --> 00:52:36,620
- Who is it?
- You know damn well who it is

482
00:52:36,831 --> 00:52:42,037
I'm sorry, I can't come to the door
right now. In my weakened condition -

483
00:52:42,252 --> 00:52:47,957
- I could take a spill down the stairs
and suffer further school absences.

484
00:52:48,968 --> 00:52:53,925
You can reach my parents at work.

485
00:52:54,139 --> 00:53:01,019
Thank you for stopping by.
I appreciate your concern.

486
00:53:01,229 --> 00:53:04,395
Have a nice day.

487
00:53:24,043 --> 00:53:26,118
Mud

488
00:53:53,115 --> 00:53:56,151
Son of a bitch!

489
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:09,044
My shoe

490
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,846
Hi, doggy

491
00:55:52,399 --> 00:55:55,019
Stay, boy

492
00:55:55,236 --> 00:55:58,402
Stay
Stay!

493
00:55:59,616 --> 00:56:02,236
Sit!

494
00:56:03,077 --> 00:56:06,907
Sit! Heel! Stay!

495
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:33,962
- We'd better go and get the car
- We have until six

496
00:58:34,185 --> 00:58:40,768
I know you don't care,
but it does mean my ass

497
00:58:40,983 --> 00:58:44,102
That hurts, Cameron

498
00:58:45,613 --> 00:58:49,195
- What have you seen today?
- Nothing good

499
00:58:49,409 --> 00:58:55,826
Nothing!
What do you mean, nothing good?

500
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,408
We've seen everything good,
we've seen the whole city

501
00:58:59,627 --> 00:59:04,335
We went to a museum
and saw priceless works of art

502
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:10,800
What? What's wrong?

503
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:20,304
Look over there

504
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:55,595
- What's he doing?
- He's making obscene gestures

505
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:59,224
What?

506
01:00:34,763 --> 01:00:39,388
- He didn't leave
- It really busts my hump

507
01:00:39,601 --> 01:00:44,594
- He didn't ditch us
- He might be back at school

508
01:00:44,815 --> 01:00:52,395
- He would not go back to school
- He'd do it just to make me sweat

509
01:00:52,614 --> 01:00:59,945
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'd like to play a little tune for you.

510
01:01:00,164 --> 01:01:05,537
I dedicate it to a man who doesn't think
he's seen anything good today.

511
01:01:05,752 --> 01:01:08,705
Cameron Frye, this one is for you.

512
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:18,756
- Get off the float!
- What are you doing?

513
01:02:00,975 --> 01:02:04,675
As long as I've known him,
everything works for him

514
01:02:04,895 --> 01:02:09,472
There's nothing he can't handle
I can't handle anything

515
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:15,112
School, parents, the future
Ferris can do anything

516
01:02:18,867 --> 01:02:24,108
- I don't know what I'm going to do
- College

517
01:02:24,331 --> 01:02:28,079
Yeah, but to do what?

518
01:02:29,544 --> 01:02:33,492
What are you interested in?

519
01:02:33,715 --> 01:02:37,297
Nothing

520
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:40,795
Me neither

521
01:02:46,477 --> 01:02:49,810
You're crazy!

522
01:02:50,523 --> 01:02:54,519
What do you think
Ferris is going to do?

523
01:02:54,736 --> 01:02:58,021
He's going to be a fry cook

524
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:57,909
Christ

525
01:06:03,673 --> 01:06:08,749
Look what Uncle Ed has for you,
you little fucker

526
01:06:15,894 --> 01:06:18,811
Jesus!

527
01:06:24,611 --> 01:06:27,445
Sleep tight, pooch

528
01:06:52,222 --> 01:06:54,379
I knew it!

529
01:07:04,734 --> 01:07:08,399
Well, where is she?
This is her daughter

530
01:07:13,493 --> 01:07:17,988
Do you know where she is?
Do you know when she'll be back?

531
01:07:18,207 --> 01:07:21,291
Do you know anything?

532
01:08:09,464 --> 01:08:14,504
- Ferris
- Bueller

533
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:38,108
You're psychotic
You're out of your mind

534
01:08:38,328 --> 01:08:43,119
I can't believe you went
on a goddam parade float!

535
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:46,166
Okay, wait

536
01:08:46,377 --> 01:08:52,046
"Yeah, this tune
is one of my personal favourites"

537
01:08:52,257 --> 01:08:56,253
- A lot of people saw you
- You are nailed

538
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:59,554
Who'd believe I was in a parade?

539
01:08:59,765 --> 01:09:05,054
Anybody who would nail me
wouldn't go to a parade

540
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:08,805
That was so quick

541
01:09:09,024 --> 01:09:16,438
- This looks okay to me, Cameron
- It looks great Let's roll

542
01:09:16,658 --> 01:09:19,148
Here you go Thank you

543
01:09:19,368 --> 01:09:25,452
You're a very generous individual
Come back anytime

544
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:30,042
- Watch the seat
- Sorry

545
01:09:32,923 --> 01:09:37,749
See you later

546
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:43,556
We've got to do this again

547
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:50,812
This is not a phoney call
There is an intruder, -

548
01:09:51,025 --> 01:09:56,445
- male Caucasian,
possibly armed, in my kitchen

549
01:09:56,655 --> 01:10:01,031
My name's Bueller

550
01:10:01,284 --> 01:10:05,446
You hope my brother's feeling better?
I'm in danger!

551
01:10:05,664 --> 01:10:11,867
I am very protective of my body
I do not want it violated or killed

552
01:10:12,086 --> 01:10:14,706
I need help!

553
01:10:14,922 --> 01:10:18,788
Speak any English? Dickhead

554
01:10:31,982 --> 01:10:38,066
Excuse me, if you're still in the
house, I'vejust called the police.

555
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:43,735
If you have any brains whatsoever,
you'll get out real quick.

556
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:50,036
I also have my father's gun
and a scorching case of herpes.

557
01:10:57,382 --> 01:11:01,924
Wait, that's my car!
I'll move it

558
01:11:02,136 --> 01:11:06,381
He got my keys

559
01:11:06,599 --> 01:11:09,718
You shithead!

560
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:23,480
I feel pretty good I feel real good

561
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:28,277
Those guys at the garage were nice
I was a little worried about them

562
01:11:28,496 --> 01:11:32,362
It turned out good

563
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:39,497
Hey

564
01:11:41,218 --> 01:11:43,922
- Cameron
- Yeah?

565
01:11:44,137 --> 01:11:48,050
How many miles did you say
this thing had on it when we left?

566
01:11:48,266 --> 01:11:52,974
126 and halfway
between three and four tenths

567
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:58,643
Why? How many miles are on it now?

568
01:12:02,029 --> 01:12:05,859
Here's where Cameron goes berserk

569
01:12:24,303 --> 01:12:27,505
Cameron, are you okay?

570
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:31,138
Cut that out

571
01:12:33,895 --> 01:12:36,302
Who is it?

572
01:12:36,522 --> 01:12:41,598
I'm sorry, I can't come to the door
right now. In my weakened condition -

573
01:12:41,819 --> 01:12:44,605
- I could take a spill
down the stairs...

574
01:12:44,822 --> 01:12:50,776
God bless the police
I'm saved Thank you, God

575
01:12:50,995 --> 01:12:56,071
- Thank...
- I heard that you were feeling ill

576
01:12:56,292 --> 01:12:59,376
headache, fever and a chill

577
01:12:59,586 --> 01:13:02,586
I came to help restore your pluck

578
01:13:02,798 --> 01:13:05,632
'cause I'm the nurse who likes to...

579
01:13:12,725 --> 01:13:16,176
This may very well be for real

580
01:13:16,395 --> 01:13:20,095
He might have blown
a microchip or two

581
01:13:20,315 --> 01:13:25,189
He's always been a little keyed up
I just wanted to give him a good day

582
01:13:25,403 --> 01:13:28,771
We're going to graduate soon

583
01:13:28,992 --> 01:13:34,233
We'll have the summer
He'll work and I'll work

584
01:13:34,455 --> 01:13:37,906
We'll see each other at night
and on the weekends

585
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:41,908
Then he'll go to one school
and I'll go to another

586
01:13:42,129 --> 01:13:45,829
Basically that will be it

587
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:50,711
Sloane's as big a problem

588
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:55,721
She has another year of high school
How do I deal with that?

589
01:13:55,934 --> 01:13:59,930
I was serious
when I said I'd marry her I would

590
01:14:00,147 --> 01:14:02,518
Cameron?

591
01:14:02,733 --> 01:14:06,978
Can you hear me?

592
01:14:07,196 --> 01:14:11,940
Cameron, blink if you understand me

593
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:17,447
Cameron has never been in love
Well, nobody has been in love with him

594
01:14:17,664 --> 01:14:23,748
If things don't change for him, he's
going to marry the first girl he lays

595
01:14:23,962 --> 01:14:28,504
And she's going to treat him like shit,
because she will have given him -

596
01:14:28,718 --> 01:14:34,173
- what he has built up in his mind as
the end all, be all of our existence

597
01:14:34,389 --> 01:14:36,796
She won't respect him

598
01:14:37,018 --> 01:14:42,224
You can't respect somebody who
kisses your ass It just doesn't work

599
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:48,642
Ferris, we'd better try something else
This isn't working

600
01:14:52,157 --> 01:14:56,367
Are you feeling better, Cameron?

601
01:14:56,578 --> 01:15:01,867
Why don't you come in here?
It's really nice

602
01:15:04,919 --> 01:15:11,288
Cameron, I can flip out real easy, too
It's okay

603
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:16,218
Sooner or later,
everybody goes to the zoo

604
01:15:20,393 --> 01:15:25,766
Maybe he's really sick
Maybe he isn't just torturing himself

605
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:13,902
Hey! Hey, Cameron!

606
01:16:14,113 --> 01:16:19,070
Cameron, wake up

607
01:16:19,285 --> 01:16:24,159
Come on, Cameron Wake up!

608
01:16:28,086 --> 01:16:33,459
- What is that?
- Ferris Bueller, you're my hero

609
01:16:33,675 --> 01:16:39,510
- That was pretty impressive, man
- You son of a bitch

610
01:16:46,646 --> 01:16:49,219
It's not funny

611
01:17:14,423 --> 01:17:17,874
Drugs?

612
01:17:18,094 --> 01:17:21,178
Thank you, no I'm straight

613
01:17:21,389 --> 01:17:25,848
I meant, are you in here for drugs?

614
01:17:26,059 --> 01:17:29,558
- Why are you here?
- Drugs

615
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:34,230
- I don't know why I'm here
- Why don't you go home?

616
01:17:34,443 --> 01:17:38,486
Why don't you
put your thumb up your butt?

617
01:17:42,034 --> 01:17:46,030
You wear too much eye make-up

618
01:17:48,749 --> 01:17:53,410
My sister wears too much
People think she's a whore

619
01:17:58,926 --> 01:18:03,053
- You don't want to talk about it?
- With you? Are you serious?

620
01:18:03,264 --> 01:18:06,679
- I'm serious
- Blow yourself

621
01:18:11,105 --> 01:18:15,896
All right,
you want to know what's wrong?

622
01:18:16,109 --> 01:18:20,520
I know what's wrong
I just want to hear you say it

623
01:18:20,739 --> 01:18:23,941
In a nutshell, I hate my brother
How's that?

624
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:28,701
That's cool Did you
blow him away or something?

625
01:18:28,914 --> 01:18:33,325
No, not yet

626
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:40,161
He was ditching school When I went
home to check, some guy was there

627
01:18:40,384 --> 01:18:43,301
The cops picked me up
for making a phoney call

628
01:18:43,512 --> 01:18:46,963
What do you care
if your brother ditches school?

629
01:18:47,182 --> 01:18:51,261
- Everybody else has to go
- You could ditch

630
01:18:51,478 --> 01:18:57,147
- I'd get caught
- Yes

631
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:02,233
You're pissed off because he ditches
and doesn't get caught, is that it?

632
01:19:03,824 --> 01:19:06,492
- Basically
- Basically

633
01:19:06,702 --> 01:19:11,778
- Your problem is you
- Excuse me?

634
01:19:11,999 --> 01:19:17,288
Worry about yourself,
not about what your brother does

635
01:19:18,839 --> 01:19:23,464
- That's just an opinion
- What are you, a psychiatrist?

636
01:19:23,677 --> 01:19:27,176
Keep your opinions to yourself

637
01:19:30,308 --> 01:19:34,885
There's somebody you should talk to

638
01:19:37,315 --> 01:19:41,263
If you say Ferris Bueller,
you lose a testicle

639
01:19:41,486 --> 01:19:43,691
Oh, you know him

640
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:56,821
That whole time
I was just thinking things over

641
01:19:57,044 --> 01:20:00,459
I was like meditating

642
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:08,754
Then I sort of watched myself
from inside

643
01:20:08,972 --> 01:20:13,680
I realised it was ridiculous
being afraid

644
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:17,889
Worrying about everything
Wishing I was dead

645
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:22,184
All that shit I'm tired of it

646
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:27,603
It was the best day of my life

647
01:20:30,785 --> 01:20:34,319
I'm going to miss you guys next year

648
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:47,675
Cameron, can I ask you a question?

649
01:20:47,886 --> 01:20:51,171
Yeah

650
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:56,134
Did you see me change
out of my clothes by the jacuzzi?

651
01:20:57,353 --> 01:21:00,057
Did you?

652
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:06,986
You saw me?
I thought you were catatonic

653
01:21:08,948 --> 01:21:13,941
That's okay I'm not embarrassed

654
01:21:14,162 --> 01:21:18,704
I better check on the car

655
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:35,597
Hey, Ferris!

656
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:38,927
Yeah?

657
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:45,181
The miles aren't coming off
going in reverse

658
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:54,321
No
I thought that might be a problem

659
01:21:54,535 --> 01:22:00,240
We have to open the odometer,
roll it back by hand

660
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:03,707
No, forget it

661
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:07,205
Forget it

662
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:14,751
I've got to take a stand

663
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:21,299
I'm bullshit

664
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:26,934
I put up with everything

665
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:33,898
My old man pushes me around

666
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:38,527
I never say anything

667
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:46,244
He's not the problem
I'm the problem

668
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:55,049
I've got to take a stand

669
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:59,045
I've got to take a stand against him

670
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:05,100
I am not going to sit on my ass -

671
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:08,765
- as the events that affect me unfold
to determine the course of my life

672
01:23:08,985 --> 01:23:13,942
I'm going to take a stand and defend it

673
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:19,742
Right or wrong,
I'm going to defend it

674
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:32,706
I'm so sick of this shit

675
01:23:32,924 --> 01:23:35,331
I can't stand him
and I hate this goddam car

676
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:39,797
Who do you love? You love a car

677
01:23:40,014 --> 01:23:43,714
You son of a bitch

678
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:06,906
Shit

679
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:12,250
I dented the shit out of it

680
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:19,417
Good

681
01:24:19,637 --> 01:24:25,508
My father will see what I did
I can't hide this

682
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:32,186
He'll come home
and he'll have to deal with me

683
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,400
I don't care I really don't

684
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:39,478
I'm just tired of being afraid

685
01:24:45,287 --> 01:24:48,323
The hell with him

686
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:53,664
I can't wait to see the look
on his face

687
01:25:23,325 --> 01:25:26,859
What did I do?

688
01:25:35,671 --> 01:25:41,340
- What did I do?
- You killed the car

689
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:20,881
Whoa!

690
01:26:21,091 --> 01:26:25,383
Holy shit!

691
01:26:38,317 --> 01:26:42,527
It's my fault
I'll take the heat for it

692
01:26:42,738 --> 01:26:48,775
When he comes home, we'll tell him
that I did it He hates me anyway

693
01:26:53,081 --> 01:26:56,247
No, I'll take it

694
01:26:56,460 --> 01:27:00,539
- I'll take it
- No, you don't want this much heat

695
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:03,591
If I didn't want it,
I wouldn't have let you take the car

696
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:10,882
- I made you take that car
- I could have stopped you

697
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:15,428
I want it
I'm going to take it, that's it

698
01:27:15,646 --> 01:27:22,858
When Morris comes home,
he and I will just have a little chat

699
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:27,814
It's cool
No, it's going to be good

700
01:27:28,033 --> 01:27:31,318
Thanks anyway

701
01:27:38,669 --> 01:27:43,080
This is a shock to me
I don't know why she left school

702
01:27:43,298 --> 01:27:47,626
And why would she come up
with a story about an intruder?

703
01:27:47,844 --> 01:27:52,552
For whatever reason she did it,
she's had a scare

704
01:27:52,765 --> 01:27:59,348
I appreciate you calling We'll have
a long talk with her at home

705
01:27:59,563 --> 01:28:01,970
Thank you

706
01:28:02,192 --> 01:28:05,643
- I hope your son is feeling better
- Pardon?

707
01:28:05,863 --> 01:28:10,358
Tell him all the guys at the station
are pulling for him

708
01:28:10,575 --> 01:28:13,030
Right

709
01:28:20,627 --> 01:28:23,746
- Hi
- Don't "hi" me, young lady

710
01:28:23,964 --> 01:28:25,956
I want to get out of here now
Now

711
01:28:26,174 --> 01:28:30,585
Okay Fine!

712
01:28:37,518 --> 01:28:43,769
- She's a little hyper
- Yeah

713
01:28:43,984 --> 01:28:48,810
Let's not ruin this
with a lot of talk, okay?

714
01:28:49,029 --> 01:28:54,782
- You didn't tell me your name
- It's Jean

715
01:28:54,994 --> 01:28:58,409
But a lot of guys call me Shauna

716
01:28:58,623 --> 01:29:02,571
- Okay, Jean
- Cool

717
01:29:02,794 --> 01:29:05,414
That's great

718
01:29:05,629 --> 01:29:09,495
I'll see you, okay?

719
01:29:12,428 --> 01:29:14,965
Jeanie, now!

720
01:29:15,182 --> 01:29:19,558
- Now!
- Okay

721
01:29:26,610 --> 01:29:31,187
- I had a great time today
- Yeah, it was pretty cool

722
01:29:33,742 --> 01:29:36,612
Will Cameron be okay?

723
01:29:36,828 --> 01:29:41,156
Yeah, sure,
for the first time in his life

724
01:29:41,374 --> 01:29:43,745
He's going to be just fine

725
01:29:50,966 --> 01:29:55,045
You knew what you were doing
when you woke up this morning

726
01:29:55,262 --> 01:29:58,962
Me? No

727
01:30:17,118 --> 01:30:19,869
Oh, shit!

728
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,997
I have to go

729
01:30:23,208 --> 01:30:26,208
- I'll call you tonight
- Okay

730
01:30:28,796 --> 01:30:32,923
- I love you
- I love you, too

731
01:30:33,134 --> 01:30:37,047
He's going to marry me

732
01:30:39,015 --> 01:30:45,099
Do you know what it's like to pick up
your daughter at the police station?

733
01:30:45,312 --> 01:30:51,480
I was about to close the deal
with the Vermont people

734
01:30:54,488 --> 01:30:59,825
I was going to take my commission
and buy Ferris a car

735
01:31:00,035 --> 01:31:04,612
What the hell are you doing?
Are you trying to kill us?

736
01:31:04,831 --> 01:31:09,242
Look at this mess I'll never
get these papers back in order

737
01:31:26,437 --> 01:31:30,932
- Slow down
- I can't drive with you yelling at me!

738
01:32:02,097 --> 01:32:05,715
Hi, I'm Ferris Bueller

739
01:33:31,894 --> 01:33:36,186
No, don't get up
That smells delicious

740
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:39,483
- Dinner's ready
- What? Who was that?

741
01:34:12,268 --> 01:34:14,639
What's wrong?

742
01:34:14,853 --> 01:34:21,104
Everything I just picked up Jeanie
at the police station

743
01:34:21,319 --> 01:34:26,276
She got a speeding ticket and I lost
the Vermont deal because of her

744
01:34:33,748 --> 01:34:37,282
Looking for this?

745
01:34:48,012 --> 01:34:49,671
I got you, Ferris

746
01:34:49,889 --> 01:34:53,837
How's Ferris?
Let's go in and check on him

747
01:34:55,394 --> 01:35:00,268
I have dreamed about this
And this time

748
01:35:00,482 --> 01:35:06,270
you little bastard,
I've got you right where I want you

749
01:35:06,488 --> 01:35:09,524
Ferris, we're home

750
01:35:09,742 --> 01:35:17,914
How would you feel
about another year at high school?

751
01:35:18,124 --> 01:35:22,915
Under my close,
personal supervision?

752
01:35:23,130 --> 01:35:27,209
Hi

753
01:35:27,426 --> 01:35:32,336
Thank God you're all right
We've been worried sick about you

754
01:35:36,102 --> 01:35:40,478
Thank you, Mr Rooney,
for driving him home

755
01:35:40,690 --> 01:35:44,900
Go upstairs and get in bed

756
01:35:54,954 --> 01:35:57,409
Scoot!

757
01:35:57,622 --> 01:36:03,042
Can you imagine someone that sick
trying to walk home from hospital?

758
01:36:03,253 --> 01:36:05,577
Kids!

759
01:36:07,715 --> 01:36:13,170
By the way, you left your wallet
on the kitchen floor

Honey

761
01:37:20,997 --> 01:37:24,945

- How do you feel?

762
01:37:25,167 --> 01:37:28,749
150% better, thank you

763
01:37:28,964 --> 01:37:35,297
Don't make me stay home again
I want to go to school

764
01:37:35,512 --> 01:37:40,386
I have to graduate in June,
and I

765
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:45,841
Ferris, you're sick Don't push it
and make yourself worse

766
01:37:46,064 --> 01:37:50,475
- Maybe you're right, Dad
- I know I'm right, pal

767
01:37:50,693 --> 01:37:57,311
- How did you get to be so sweet?
- From years of practice

I'm going to get myself settled,
then I'll bring you a hot cup of soup

771
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:45,783
I've said it before and I'll say
it again: Life moves pretty fast

772
01:38:45,999 --> 01:38:50,660
If you don't stop and look around
once in a while, you could miss it

773
01:39:00,679 --> 01:39:04,130
Four years I've been chasing this kid

774
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:09,556
Four years he's been
making a fool of me

775
01:39:17,989 --> 01:39:23,409
Hey, Mr Rooney, what's going on?

776
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:27,988
Did you get in a fight?

777
01:39:28,207 --> 01:39:31,575
Do you want a lift?

778
01:41:15,230 --> 01:41:20,389
I bet you never smelled
a real school bus before

779
01:41:33,247 --> 01:41:36,117
Gummi bear?

780
01:41:36,333 --> 01:41:40,792
They've been in my pocket
They're real warm and soft

781
01:42:27,218 --> 01:42:31,428
You're still here?

782
01:42:31,639 --> 01:42:34,805
It's over

783
01:42:35,017 --> 01:42:37,970
Go home

784
01:42:40,524 --> 01:42:42,646
