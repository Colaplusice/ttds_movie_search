1
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:08,216
I'll bring you back a slice of cake,

2
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,847
<i>Get away from the window,</i>

3
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,653
Punch, you will call me, won't you?

4
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,463
This way, please,

5
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,236
No, no, I'll take them,

6
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:06,244
Look, Ma, it's gorgeous,

7
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,907
Well, you're very welcome, Christy,
very welcome,

8
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,213
<i>To your humble abode,</i>

9
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,116
Hm?

10
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,781
Oh, my humble abode, Yes...

11
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:29,763
Hello, My name is Mary,
I'll be with you till you go on this evening,

12
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,669
I have to take him into the library,

13
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,068
<i>- I'll see you later,
- See you later,</i>

14
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,116
Be careful of that fella,

15
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,174
I'll be OK,

16
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:50,055
I wouldn't be too sure about that,

17
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:11,005
Well, now, you're all very welcome
to my humble abode,

18
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:16,982
and to this benefit organized
by my friend Dr Eileen Cole,

19
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,109
Dr Eileen Cole,

20
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:27,655
<i>Now I'm not going to ask you to put
your hands in your pockets, not yet,</i>

21
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:33,165
<i>because we're going to start
the evening with a little concert.</i>

22
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,792
Do you want to go out and watch?

23
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,127
No,

24
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,951
Do you want to see the original?

25
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,419
The original?

26
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,479
Of the book,

27
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,644
It looks good,

28
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,347
Looks can be deceivin',

29
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,019
It's a bit sentimental,

30
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,554
Did you paint this?

31
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,622
Yes,

32
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,558
That's very good,

33
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,954
Mr Brown?

34
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:47,989
Your son was born a couple of hours ago,
There's been some complications,

35
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,433
<i>- Where's the small one?
- A pint and a small one?</i>

36
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:02,607
- That's what I said,
- So long as you're payin' for it,

37
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,485
Are you gonna put him in a home, Paddy?

38
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:21,124
He'll go in a coffin before
any son of mine will go in a home,

39
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:27,139
Ah, Paddy... I believe it's the end of
the road for you in the breedin' stakes,

40
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,805
Who told you that?

41
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:37,215
Ah, now... What are you goin' to do, huh?

42
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,279
You goin' to tie a knot in it?

43
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,488
Now, Paddy, there was no need for that,

44
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,588
A shut mouth catches no flies,

45
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,600
Where's Tom?

46
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,146
<i>Is Tom not up yet?</i>

47
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,821
<i>It's all right! I'm up! I'm up ages!</i>

48
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,294
Say goodbye to Christy, Father,

49
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,893
<i>Goodbye, Christy,</i>

50
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,405
<i>Good girl, See you later,</i>

51
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,134
See you, Christy,

52
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,143
- See you, Christy,
- Bye, Christy,

53
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,624
Something for the money box, Christy,

54
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,747
Another pound saved, Christy,

55
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,952
Here, Christy,

56
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,701
Good boy, That's it,

57
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,477
I have to go away, Christy,

58
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,020
To hospital,

59
00:10:56,088 --> 00:11:00,684
Don't worry, Sheila's going
to look after you while I'm gone,

60
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,219
Do you understand, Christy?

61
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,170
That's my ma, That's my da,

62
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,209
<i>I was their baby,</i>

63
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,188
It's only for a few days, Christy,

64
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,188
I'd better get this house
organized before I go,

65
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:43,499
You can't be stickin' to me
like stickin' plaster forever, Christy,

66
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,093
Nearly there, Christy,

67
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:43,352
Christy, I have to go and make
a phone call, Stay there,

68
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,134
Oh, my God... Nan...

69
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,201
Nan! Nan!

70
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:31,359
- But what really happened?
- I heard this bangin' and rushed over,

71
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:35,134
She was carryin' Christy
down the stairs when she fell,

72
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:40,873
And there he was,
lyin' at the bottom of the stairs like a moron,

73
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,279
God help her,
He's a terrible cross to the poor woman,

74
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,842
Ah, sure he has the mind
of a three-year-old,

75
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,181
<i>A is for apples,</i>

76
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,889
<i>B is for butter,</i>

77
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,194
<i>C is for carrot,</i>

78
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,841
<i>And D... is for dunce,</i>

79
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,577
Ya poor, unfortunate gobshite,

80
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:23,182
Enough to feed an army,
God, you'll never go hungry, Christy,

81
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,896
Would you like to come back with me
till your mammy comes home?

82
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,653
<i>What's 25 percent of a quarter?</i>

83
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,419
<i>25 percent of a quarter?</i>

84
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,219
Now that's a stupid question,

85
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:12,596
<i>I mean, 25 percent is a quarter,
You can't have a quarter of a quarter,</i>

86
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,435
You can, Can't you, Christy?

87
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,975
What would he know?

88
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,190
Ma, Ma, Christy picked up the chalk,

89
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,939
Go on, Christy, Go on, make your mark,

90
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,145
<i>It's a Y.</i>

91
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,550
<i>It's an X.</i>

92
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,823
- What's that, Christy?
- That's only an oul' squiggle,

93
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,077
There's something in that,

94
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,485
Nah, don't be gettin' notions
into your head, woman,

95
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,546
The child's a cripple, Face facts,

96
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:42,890
It won't do anybody any good
trying to put ideas in his head,

97
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:55,668
Right, Now come on,
We're gonna put the engine on now,

98
00:17:55,741 --> 00:18:00,269
- You're puttin' an engine in it?
- Yeah, Come on till you see,

99
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,046
Come on, engine,
All he needs now is a license,

100
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,349
It's great,

101
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:19,394
Take it easy, will ya?
Ah, go on, take it easy,

102
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,926
He'll play in that all day now,

103
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,435
He can go out with the other boys now,

104
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,002
Look at those! They're massive!

105
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,810
- What's that?
- That's her thing,

106
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,318
You put your thing in there
for a half an hour and you get a baby,

107
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,445
If you do it for an hour you get twins,

108
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,990
My cousin's a twin,

109
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,289
- Benny! Brian!
- There's your ma,

110
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,693
Quick, Tom, Here's Ma!

111
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,526
- It's not mine!
- Is Benny in there?

112
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,567
- Hide it!
- Where?

113
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,761
Are you deaf? Come in for your tea!

114
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,236
- Hide it under Christy,
- Are yis all deaf?

115
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,002
I've been calling you for 20 minutes
to come in for your tea,

116
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,943
- It's OK, Mam, we'll take him in,
- Well, take him in now,

117
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,709
It's been on the table
for at least a half an hour,

118
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,422
See?

119
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,515
Why won't he go to bed?

120
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,053
He loves that oul' chariot,

121
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:54,321
Come on, get him up,
I want to go and have a pint,

122
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,088
Come on, Christy,
It's way past your bedtime,

123
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,792
It's nearly closin' time,

124
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:20,015
Now, son, you know
you can never get out of hell,

125
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:25,113
You can get out of purgatory,
but you can never get out of hell,

126
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,656
Do you know that?

127
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,956
Do you?

128
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,360
Mrs Brown?

129
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:46,835
I don't think you should
bring him to the altar just yet,

130
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:51,207
You've been very helpful, Father,

131
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:24,078
Do you know about All Souls' Night?
Did I ever tell you about that?

132
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:29,212
It's a really special night, Every time
you light a candle on All Souls' Night,

133
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:34,521
and you have to say five Our Fathers
and five Hail Marys and five Glory Be's,

134
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:39,496
and then a soul flies up
out of the flames of purgatory

135
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,226
and goes straight up to heaven,

136
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:47,199
Say some prayers
for the poor souls in purgatory,

137
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,839
Right,

138
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,821
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

139
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,849
Christy, keep your voice down,
What's wrong with you, son?

140
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,555
What's the matter? What do you want?

141
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:17,928
Do you want to light another candle,
is that it? Do you? For the poor souls?

142
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,266
Good boy, That's a good boy,

143
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,769
And don't forget, even if we
can't understand you, God can,

144
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:49,330
See, Christy?
Even God has to lock his house,

145
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:09,580
Look, Christy, there it is!
There's a soul going up to heaven!

146
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,851
Oh, look! Look, Christy, Oh, look,

147
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,259
- Oh, you'll frighten the life out of him!
- Here, Christy, You're king of the bonfire,

148
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:28,238
Don't be frightened, Christy,
It's only your brother, Tom,

149
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,934
This way, Christy, This way,

150
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,285
You all right, Christy?

151
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:19,483
<i>What's Christy doin', Sheila?
Is he all right?</i>

152
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,859
He's drawin',

153
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,258
He's drawin' a triangle,

154
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,064
No, Christy, you don't start there,

155
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,965
Here, son,

156
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,084
Now that's a triangle,

157
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,256
That's not a triangle,

158
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,889
<i>That's an A.</i>

159
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,526
<i>- What's up?
- Keep quiet,</i>

160
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,368
- All I said was "What's up?"
- Sit down!

161
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,908
Here, Paddy,
Why don't you go and have a pint?

162
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,009
- What?
- Here,

163
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,247
- What's that?
- It's money,

164
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:26,552
- Where'd you get it?
- From the fairies,

165
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,921
- Go and have a drink,
- I don't need a drink,

166
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:33,362
All I need is to be obeyed
in me own house!

167
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,073
Mother,

168
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,828
Sweet Jesus...

169
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,205
Jesus sufferin' Christ...

170
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:37,015
He's a Brown! He's a Brown, all right,
Christy's a Brown!

171
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,690
- Coat,
- Where are you goin', Paddy?

172
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,786
Where do you think?
This man deserves a jar!

173
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,833
This is Christy Brown,

174
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:02,539
My son, Genius,

175
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,279
Hello,

176
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,952
Is he OK?

177
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,995
- He's grand,
- Good,

178
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:21,055
It's just that he can be a bit...

179
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,461
- What?
- A bit... a bit like Christy,

180
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,571
No, he's fine, He's asleep now,

181
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:36,674
Well... I'll leave you alone then,

182
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,819
14,

183
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,730
15, 16...

184
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,701
- Keep your voice down,
- ... 17...

185
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,328
Great,

186
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,710
Happy birthday to you

187
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:14,440
Happy birthday to you

188
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:19,316
Happy birthday, dear Christy

189
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:24,225
Happy birthday to you

190
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,330
Go on, Go on now, me boy,

191
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,233
He's a man now, Father,
Come on, Christy, 17 candles,

192
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,863
<i>Now take a deep breath, Come on,</i>

193
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,204
Will you shut that baby up,
for Christ's sake?

194
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,143
- Take it easy, Christy,
- Go on,

195
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,513
Go on, Christy, Go on,

196
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,245
Go on, Christy,

197
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,623
Go on,

198
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:03,395
- It's like the bleedin' fire of hell, that one,
- Come on, Christy, Here,

199
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,800
There you are, now, Go on,

200
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:11,240
That's it, Well done, Don't worry,
you'll get your wheelchair, Christy,

201
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,047
Get the fuckin' ball!

202
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,946
Save it, Christy!

203
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:29,120
Well saved, Christy!

204
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,024
He bit me! He bit me!

205
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,667
- It's a free out! A free out!
- Right, OK,

206
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:44,037
- We're takin' it, right?
- OK, come on,

207
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,099
Pass it, will ya?

208
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,578
Stay away from them sheets,

209
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:57,011
He handled it!
Penno for the Browns, Give us it,

210
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,888
Let Christy take it,

211
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,638
- You can't hold him up!
- Right,

212
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:03,415
If it stops at Tom, I'll kill ya,

213
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:12,023
- Nobody,
- No, nobody,

214
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,722
It's pointin' at Christy,

215
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:19,431
- He's not in the game,
- He is if it's pointin' at him,

216
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,337
I don't think it's pointin' at me,

217
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,324
Sure you're the nicest of the lot,

218
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,893
And you've nice eyes too,

219
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:55,899
Let's go, Ah, Christy, ya boy, ya!
Chasin' the women!

220
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,305
- See you, Tom,
- See you, Rachel,

221
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,368
See you, Tom,

222
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,283
She's mad about you, Christy!

223
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,472
Not here, Brendan, Later,

224
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,084
<i>This is a fine time of night
to be comin' in,</i>

225
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,689
- What's wrong, Ma?
- I don't like these late nights, Sheila,

226
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,536
What's this?

227
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,781
Holiday pay, isn't it?

228
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,045
I got laid off,

229
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,420
What about Christy's wheelchair?

230
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:33,287
Christy will get his wheelchair, OK?

231
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,663
Why did you get laid off?

232
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:43,367
Don't you question me
in front of the children,

233
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:50,778
A brick hit the foreman on the head
accidentally on purpose,

234
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,221
It's Rachel,

235
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,296
- How are ya?
- What?

236
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:20,706
"Your beautiful eyes are splendid pools
of blue in whose depths I swim regularly,"

237
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:24,805
It's lovely, isn't it?
He even signed it himself,

238
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,818
Even signed it himself,

239
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:40,159
CB, That's not Tom Brown,

240
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:44,657
That's Christy,
Sure he does it with his left foot!

241
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:51,168
You're in love with a cripple!
She's in love with a cripple!

242
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,875
Rachel, come back!

243
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:04,687
Could I speak to Christy Brown, please?

244
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,989
Christy! You're wanted,

245
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,303
Did you paint that?

246
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,366
Yeah,

247
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,143
I can't take it,

248
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,039
I'm sorry,

249
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,053
Tell your brother Tom
we were askin' for him,

250
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:07,181
<i>- What's this?
- What does it look like?</i>

251
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,785
But we had porridge for breakfast,

252
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,650
So?

253
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,260
And we had it for dinner,

254
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,958
So?

255
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,278
I'm not eatin' any more,

256
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,111
You get that into ya,

257
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,244
I can't,

258
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,420
Get it into ya,

259
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,343
Go on, more,

260
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:12,280
<i>Who's been eating my porridge?</i>

261
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,652
<i>What did you say?</i>

262
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,154
- What did he say, missus?
- He just said the porridge is lovely,

263
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,664
Burst his brain, the barbarian,

264
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,069
Keep quiet!

265
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,805
Aw, come on, Christy,
Everybody has to go to bed,

266
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,216
I have to do my painting,

267
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,651
I know, but everybody has to go to bed
because there's no coal,

268
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:30,956
Now, Christy, don't push me nerves
any further, all right?

269
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:34,027
I'm sorry, Mam,

270
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:40,101
Yeah, Oh, Christy, someday
you'll have a place of your own,

271
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:46,675
Right, come on, you lot, come on in,

272
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,678
Mind my paintings,

273
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,681
<i>- Are all those kids in bed?
- Right,</i>

274
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:38,084
- What's up, Christy?
- Coal,

275
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,824
- What?
- Coal!

276
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:45,565
Coal? It's too early,

277
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:50,631
- Coal!
- All right, all right!

278
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,846
Mister!

279
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:04,013
Mister! Me driver abandoned me,
Could you push me out of the way?

280
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:27,074
- Your plan's not working, Christy,
- Wait till it goes up the hill,

281
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,790
Margaret, hold the baby,

282
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,397
Come on, Christy!

283
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:03,802
We'll be warm for the whole winter,
Christy!

284
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,850
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
What's happened to you?!

285
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,916
It's all right, Ma, It's only coal,

286
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:19,929
I know where you got that coal,

287
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,522
You know it's a sin to steal,

288
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:26,464
And you know that God
is looking down on you right now,

289
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:29,700
And that coal is not coming
into this house!

290
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:39,271
Come on in here
and sit by the fire, woman,

291
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:51,318
- Do you want me to wash you, Christy?
- No,

292
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,791
- Good night, Christy,
- Don't you be late,

293
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:13,372
Ma! There's somethin' wrong
with Christy!

294
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,543
There's somethin' wrong with him,

295
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,179
What's wrong with you, Christy?

296
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,255
The fire,

297
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,355
The fire,

298
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,998
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

299
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,659
Aagh!

300
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,943
- Ma, what are you trying to do?!
- Get water, quick,

301
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,168
Hurry up,

302
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,676
What's wrong with you? Are you mad?!

303
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,343
What have you got in the box, woman?

304
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,782
Christy's money,

305
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,980
- What?
- Money for Christy's wheelchair,

306
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:40,498
- Must be 20 in there,
- 28, seven and threepence,

307
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:47,740
We've been freezin' cold, eatin' porridge
for breakfast, dinner and tea,

308
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:52,612
and you have 28, seven and threepence
up the fuckin' chimney?!

309
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:17,070
Tom, Brian, everybody, upstairs,

310
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,032
Now,

311
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,775
- Mam, what's going on?
- You too, Christy,

312
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:51,568
Your daughter's gettin' married,

313
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:02,443
Oh, that's wonderful news,

314
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:07,082
- When?
- Friday,

315
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,193
What's the rush?

316
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:17,592
- She's pregnant,
- That's great news,

317
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:24,597
I mean, that's wonderful,
That's just what we need,

318
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,810
Who's the father? Or do you know?

319
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:32,979
Leave me alone, It's not my fault,

320
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,349
And whose fault is it, then? Is it mine?

321
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,015
That's a lovely picture,
The oul' woman that lives in the shoe

322
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,320
and the daughter
that can't keep her knickers on!

323
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:45,361
Stop it, Stop it!

324
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:49,798
<i>- Ya dirty sleeveen bitch!
- Stop it! Stop it, Father!</i>

325
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,699
<i>- Get out of here, Sheila,
- She should be thrown out!</i>

326
00:47:56,773 --> 00:48:00,038
Her and her swollen belly!
I'll give her fornication!

327
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,169
<i>Get away from me,</i>

328
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:06,205
<i>- That'll keep your legs shut for ya!
- Paddy, leave her!</i>

329
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:11,984
I'll get hold of you!
I'll break every bone in your fuckin' body!

330
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:16,686
- I'll fuckin' kill him,
- Oh, Christy, stop,

331
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,661
<i>Jesus Christ! What am
I going to do in this fuckin' house?!</i>

332
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,324
Tom, Benny, stop him,

333
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,698
<i>For Christ's sake stop, Christy!</i>

334
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:28,465
Christy, stop!
Christy!

335
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:32,406
Stop, Christy, stop,
Please, stop!

336
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:56,061
He's gone now,
Christy,

337
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:00,428
Come on, Christy,
Christy,

338
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,472
Christy,

339
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,530
It's OK,

340
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:08,477
Christy, I'm going away,

341
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:14,814
I'll miss you too,

342
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:21,217
Look after me ma for me,

343
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:54,523
I need a light,

344
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:56,855
- What?
- I need a light,

345
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,361
I don't smoke,

346
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,590
I need a light,

347
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:05,328
I'm not deaf, I can hear ya,
You need a light,

348
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:11,864
I haven't got any matches, so you'll just
have to wait here while I go and get one,

349
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,373
Don't think I'm your mother
just cos I'm looking after you,

350
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:25,820
I don't need a fuckin' psychology lesson,
I just need a fuckin' light,

351
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:45,396
- Light,
- Have you got a cigarette?

352
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:48,535
I'm just after tellin' ya I don't smoke,

353
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,605
Was there anything else I can do for you?

354
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:09,855
Glass,

355
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:14,767
No point in drinkin' out of the bottle, huh?

356
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:39,560
Hello, Dr Cole, please,

357
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:42,955
Hello, Eileen,

358
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,234
Yes, Yeah,

359
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,794
Athetoid cerebral palsy,

360
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,008
- He's 19?
- Yes, 19,

361
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,108
Yes, 19,

362
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,545
Yes, that's correct,

363
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,048
Mm, Mm,

364
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,278
I'll get his address,

365
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:04,343
OK, OK,

366
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:13,954
Dr Cole thinks that...
this model would be the best for your son,

367
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,460
- Which one?
- This one here,

368
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,995
That is grand,

369
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:26,232
See that there?
He won a prize for that,

370
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,710
- It's lovely,
- Wait till I show you now...

371
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,343
- What's that there?
- Oh, that's nothing, Isn't that lovely?

372
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:37,853
And that one,
That got torn, but we put it together again,

373
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:41,550
Ah, that's his first one he ever did, there,

374
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:51,991
Christy, there's someone to see ya,

375
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,433
This is Dr Cole,

376
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,869
Hello, Christy,

377
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:08,144
You're a great painter,

378
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,809
Thanks,

379
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:19,257
Look, I'm a doctor, like your mother says,
and I specialize in cerebral palsy,

380
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:26,832
We've just started a clinic here in Dublin
and, I wonder, would you like to attend it?

381
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,404
No, we don't have to pay, Christy,
We don't have to pay,

382
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,980
Well?

383
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:50,392
- He said "Hope deferred...
- ... maketh the heart sick,"

384
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,792
I understood that,

385
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:58,329
Ah, come on,

386
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,392
Maybe,

387
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:03,469
Good,

388
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:12,945
- Good morning, Christy,
- Good morning,

389
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:14,643
No!

390
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,717
You have to, What do you
want me to do, tow you behind?

391
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:21,814
Do you wanna ride up front
with the driver?

392
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:24,359
Come on, come up the front with me,

393
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,590
- I'm all right,
- He said he's all right,

394
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,783
Eileen,

395
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,496
Eileen, Will you come here?

396
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:40,132
Come on, relax,

397
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:43,263
- What?
- I want to go home,

398
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,002
- Are you sure?
- Yeah,

399
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,106
<i>The door's been locked
for two days now,</i>

400
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:00,585
I'll tell him you're here,

401
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:04,618
- Christy?
- Go away,

402
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:09,529
Christy, there's somebody
here to see you,

403
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:17,963
<i>Christy?</i>

404
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,576
I'm not a child,

405
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:28,743
<i>"I'm not a child" he says,
It's only children at the clinic,</i>

406
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:35,715
<i>Christy, if you like,
we can work here,</i>

407
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,726
Fuck off,

408
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:45,132
With speech therapy, I could teach you
how to say "fuck off' more clearly,

409
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:14,455
One, two, three, four, five,

410
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:16,294
And over again,

411
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,630
One, two...

412
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,635
Just relax with it,

413
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:24,332
Three, four, five, That's it,

414
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,672
One, two, three, and out,

415
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:35,644
Breathe,

416
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,182
No, Your lungs are too weak,

417
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,283
Try this instead,

418
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,630
Right, now you have a go,

419
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,691
Blow,

420
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:57,329
Steady, steady... And one big breath,

421
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:02,605
That's very good, That's very good,

422
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:05,714
Now focus the breath,

423
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:11,486
Breathe slowly, and...

424
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:16,987
He's been like that for three days, I don't
know what's wrong, he won't talk to me,

425
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,188
Go on up and see him, Go on,

426
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,837
I've brought you a present,

427
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:38,370
Thanks,

428
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,646
There's a speech in there
I'd love you to look at,

429
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,712
<i>It's "To be, or not to be", Hamlet.</i>

430
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:52,951
I wish you'd stop
feeling sorry for yourself,

431
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:58,760
You know, I don't want
to be a failure either,

432
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,995
Will you have a look at it for me?

433
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,266
Maybe,

434
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:31,892
<i>To be...</i>

435
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:36,133
or not to be...

436
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:45,178
To be, or not to be,

437
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:48,274
that is the question,

438
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:52,681
To be, or not...

439
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:04,261
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind...

440
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:14,170
To be, or not to be,

441
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:17,508
that is the question,

442
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,880
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind...

443
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:26,855
to have to fuckin' suffer listenin' to that...

444
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:32,259
He's in love with this girl Eileen,

445
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:37,866
Well, so long as he's gettin' better,

446
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:42,335
Could get hurt, Paddy,

447
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:48,168
A broken body's nothin'
to a broken heart,

448
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:05,958
<i>Yeah,</i>

449
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:08,224
Eileen, How's it goin'?

450
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:10,492
Very, very well,

451
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:15,031
- I've got some news for you,
- What?

452
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:19,200
Well, remember I told you
about Peter and his gallery?

453
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:23,211
Well, he's offered you
an exhibition of your own,

454
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,407
What do you think about that?

455
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:34,018
- I think you're brilliant,
- Yeah,

456
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:37,025
I'm only as brilliant as my patients,

457
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:48,031
<i>...consummation devoutly
to be wish'd, To die, to sleep...</i>

458
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:53,600
...to sleep, perchance to dream...

459
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:02,613
- Is that our Christy up there?
- What?

460
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:06,045
Does that sound like our Christy?

461
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:08,716
Sounds a lot better,

462
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,593
Not to me, it doesn't,

463
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:18,623
Are ya mad, woman? You can
understand your child for the first time,

464
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:23,798
- I always understood him,
- Ah, well, nobody else ever did,

465
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:26,501
At least he can function now,

466
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:32,137
There's somethin' in that voice that...
that disturbs me,

467
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,980
What do you mean?

468
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:39,352
Too much hope in it,

469
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,514
What?

470
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,187
There's too much hope in it,

471
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:52,557
"... fly to others that we know not of?"

472
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:57,197
"Thus conscience
doth make cowards of us all... "

473
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:02,203
- "And thus the native hue... "
- "And thus the native hue of resolution

474
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:05,714
is sicklied o'er
with the pale cast of thought,

475
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,684
and enterprises of great pitch
and moment with this regard

476
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:13,688
their currents turn awry
and lose the name of action,"

477
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:17,355
What do you think about Hamlet?

478
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:20,190
A cripple, Can't act,

479
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:24,529
- He did in the end,
- Too late,

480
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:32,230
Eileen...

481
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:36,135
I like you very much,

482
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:41,807
And I like you, Christy,
You've the heart of a poet,

483
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:43,875
No...

484
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:46,718
Well...

485
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,849
What?

486
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:55,720
Nothin',

487
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:02,832
I'd better go,

488
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:15,049
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you,

489
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:23,216
It gives me great pleasure to open this
exhibition of the work of Christy Brown,

490
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:29,323
A lot of people say that Christy
is a great crippled painter,

491
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:33,528
- I think that's an insult to Christy,
- That's right,

492
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:36,436
Christy is simply a great painter, full stop,

493
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:42,238
He has struggled with his material,
as every painter must do,

494
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:44,802
to bring it under control,

495
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:49,107
If you look around the walls today,

496
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:53,645
you'll see the forces
that shaped Christy Brown,

497
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,850
His mother,

498
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:59,759
His father, His brothers and sisters,

499
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:03,959
And the lady who brought him
to public recognition, Dr Eileen Cole,

500
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:05,295
Yes!

501
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:21,250
What do you think...

502
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:24,718
There's only two kinds of painting:

503
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:27,449
religious and the circus,

504
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,583
Give us a drink,

505
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:38,600
You know, on each side of the mouth...

506
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,881
There you are,

507
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:07,360
And you've had enough to drink,
D'you hear me?

508
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:11,491
I'm all right, I'm goin' for a meal, Ma,
Are you comin'?

509
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:15,697
No, no, I'm... I'll take your father home,
He's not feeling well,

510
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:19,699
There's no pints, you mean,
It's good wine, tell him,

511
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:24,269
Your father never drank anything but pints
in his life, No, I'll take him home,

512
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:28,113
- You gettin' a taxi?
- Eileen's givin' us a lift,

513
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:29,173
Right,

514
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:32,186
- I'll see ya later, Mam,
- I'll see ya later,

515
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:38,117
I think Mulcahy is a great painter,

516
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:40,924
Inside, Soul,

517
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,431
You see? I agree with Christy,

518
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,626
No, He's too uncontrolled for me,

519
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:52,463
Ah, Let Christy try the wine,

520
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:06,182
<i>Intro ibo ad altare Dei.</i>

521
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:09,957
- What's he saying?
- The Latin mass,

522
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:15,325
I thought it was James Joyce,
The wine's A1,

523
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:20,028
- Can you tell us which year it is, Christy?
- I'm not that sophisticated,

524
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:22,093
Not yet,

525
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,215
I love you, Eileen,

526
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:49,790
- And I love you, Christy,
- No, I really love you,

527
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,501
I love you all,

528
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:05,142
- That's good,
- I even love Peter,

529
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:16,222
Well, I'm glad you like Peter, because
we're going to get married in six months,

530
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:19,284
Well, Christy, what do you think of that?

531
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:38,169
<i>Con...</i>

532
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:44,342
Con...

533
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,381
Con...

534
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,118
gra...

535
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:56,688
tu...

536
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:05,429
lations, Peter and Eileen,

537
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:07,635
on the wonder...

538
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:13,008
wonderful news,

539
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:30,364
I'm glad you taught me how to speak...
so I could say that, Eileen,

540
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:40,141
Thanks, Christy,

541
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:43,610
Well, where were we then?

542
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,341
- Discussing Mulcahy,
- Mulcahy is empty,

543
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:51,409
- I thought you said he was full of soul,
- I said he was empty, Whiskey!

544
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,454
Take it easy, Christy,

545
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:02,824
You're not my mother,

546
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,930
Never forget that,

547
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:28,948
<i>And you know, I know what age that is,</i>

548
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:33,094
That's ten-year-old,

549
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,593
Same age as me,

550
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,827
- Don't give him any more,
- Pour,

551
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:44,498
- Take that whiskey from him, Tony,
- Touch it, and I'll kick you

552
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:51,979
in the only part of your anatomy
that's animated,

553
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,907
Stop it,

554
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:06,684
Why did you say you loved me?

555
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:11,597
- Because I do love you,
- Ah, you mean platonic love,

556
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:18,634
I've had nothing but platonic love
all me life,

557
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:22,700
Do you know what I say? Fuck Plato!

558
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:29,280
Fuck all love that is not
100 percent commitment!

559
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,783
Pour,

560
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:47,168
- I can't let you go any further,
- Let's discuss nature,

561
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:51,636
- Christy...
- What are you going to do about it, Peter?

562
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:55,666
You're a nice man,
What are you going to do about it?

563
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,613
Peter, sit down,

564
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:02,117
I'm gonna wheel you
out of this restaurant,

565
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:08,621
Wheel out the cripple! Wheel out...

566
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:10,420
Stop, Stop it,

567
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:14,053
Where's the feckin' brake
on this stupid thing?!

568
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:16,461
Stop it! Stop it!

569
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:19,296
Stop it, you bastard, stop it!

570
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,675
Sharon!

571
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:41,348
Sharon? Come on in
for your tea, will ya?

572
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:46,718
Sharon, come in now
for your tea, please, Come on,

573
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:48,990
All right, all right, Ma,

574
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:31,391
Get up, Christy,

575
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:35,870
You've got a hangover,
that's all that's wrong with ya,

576
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:44,640
You get more like your father every day,

577
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:49,309
All hard on the outside
and putty on the inside,

578
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:53,846
<i>It's in here battles are won,</i>

579
01:14:55,757 --> 01:15:00,751
Not in the pub, pretending
to be a big fella in front of the lads,

580
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,733
Right, if you've given up, I haven't,

581
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,560
What do you think you're doin', Mam?

582
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,324
Buildin' a room for ya,

583
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:14,258
Don't be mad,

584
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:19,069
Maybe if you have a room of your own,
you might start paintin' again,

585
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:31,750
You have me heart broken, Christy Brown,

586
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:36,288
<i>Sometimes I think you are me heart,</i>

587
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:42,329
Look, if I could give you my legs,
I would gladly take yours,

588
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:47,958
What's wrong with you, Christy?

589
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:53,905
I'm sorry, Mam,

590
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:12,886
What in the name of God
is goin' on here?

591
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:15,452
Christy and me is buildin' a room,

592
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:18,962
- Yis are buildin' a room?
- Yeah,

593
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:25,372
Will ya have a look at this?

594
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:32,444
Ah, Christy, you may be a great painter,
but you'll never be a brickie,

595
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:34,914
Fair play to ya, missus,

596
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:39,847
Right, lads, You bring in some
more bricks, mix up a bit of muck,

597
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:45,757
Bring me in me level, will ya? Brown
and Son contractors are on the job,

598
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:51,225
Here, you start there, I'll start here, and
by the time you have three courses up

599
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:55,099
- I'll be finished and havin' me tea,
- Not at all!

600
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:59,129
Water, More water,

601
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:03,103
I'm not beaten yet, bejasus!

602
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:11,947
Listen, Brian, boys, listen to me,
Let your father win, He needs it,

603
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:16,414
Here, Take it easy, Father, will ya?

604
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:19,550
Take it easy!

605
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:26,023
Sure I was never able to take it easy,
And you, of all people, ought to know that,

606
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:27,898
Right, lads?

607
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:32,536
That's her finished,

608
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:39,042
They've a long way to go
to be a better man than their father,

609
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:54,285
Well, Christy, that's the nearest
he'll ever come to sayin' he loves you,

610
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:09,833
I'm parched, I'm going to make a nice
cup of tea, and I have a cherry cake here,

611
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,902
Oh, Christy!

612
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:18,519
I'll just put the kettle on and get
the cherry log, and we'll be away,

613
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:24,389
Ah, come on, who's in there?
Those kids, their tomfoolery!

614
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:27,792
- What's happening?
- Ah, come on, let me in!

615
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:30,630
What's goin' on?

616
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:33,567
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph! Christy!
- What?

617
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:37,071
Your father's lying on the floor
and I can't open the door,

618
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:41,735
Jesus, Mary and Joseph! Paddy!
Christy, I can't open the door!

619
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:53,678
- Get out the way, Mam,
- I can't open the door, Oh, Jesus...

620
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:56,319
Push, Christy, push!

621
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:09,897
Paddy? Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
Paddy!

622
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:20,615
Seven pounds five shillings and sixpence
he owed, missus,

623
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:26,749
And whenever there was
a bit of a scrimmage

624
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,916
I was the toughest of all

625
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:34,251
Sure I was the toughest of all

626
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:37,928
Fair play to ya, Christy,

627
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:42,833
- Drinks for everyone,
- Take it easy, Christy,

628
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:46,904
Get some drinks in, Get one
for Sadie, shut the oul' bitch up,

629
01:20:46,975 --> 01:20:49,569
Fair play to ya,
Your oul' fella will never be dead,

630
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:52,238
How's me ma going to survive?

631
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:56,045
Don't be worryin' about that,
We'll be all right,

632
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:01,989
Terry, will ya tell us
about when you and me oul' fella

633
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:05,584
carried the foreman
up the ladder, will ya?

634
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,060
- Later,
- Yeah...

635
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:18,401
Give us a song, somebody,
for Jesus' sake! Tom, give us a song,

636
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:21,738
Christy... Sing Paddy's favorite
for me, would ya?

637
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,801
All right, yeah,

638
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:33,314
It was down the glen one Easter morn

639
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:37,823
To a city fair rode I

640
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:44,423
There armored lines of marching men

641
01:21:44,499 --> 01:21:46,865
In squadrons passed me by

642
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:49,403
Will somebody shut him up?

643
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:52,167
No fife did hum

644
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:59,737
No battle drum did sound its loud tattoo

645
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:04,251
And the Angelus bell
o'er the Liffey's swell

646
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:09,848
- You'll have to keep it down a bit, lads,
- Rang out in the foggy dew

647
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:16,030
- He was singin' that for his father,
- His father was nothin' but a mouth,

648
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:19,499
Like all the Browns,

649
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:24,968
All right, lads, take it easy,

650
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:28,442
In respect for Da,

651
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:40,888
I don't fight cripples,

652
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:49,795
Wreck the pub!

653
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,161
Come on!

654
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:02,643
Somebody get the till!
Get the till, get the money!

655
01:23:04,212 --> 01:23:06,203
Get the till!

656
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:15,412
Drinks are on the house!

657
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:29,701
That's great, Christy,

658
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:33,899
- No, it's not,
- Why not?

659
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:37,167
It's not there, I've no eye,

660
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:41,371
- What?
- I'm not a painter,

661
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:46,820
I think it's brilliant, It's the image of Da,

662
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:57,759
- Poor Tom, what?
- Yeah,

663
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:03,962
"All is nothing,
Therefore nothing must end,"

664
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:08,169
- What's all this, Christy?
- Nothing,

665
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:10,404
Sorry I asked,

666
01:24:17,185 --> 01:24:20,086
Benny, would you help us?

667
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:23,556
- Doin' what?
- Writin',

668
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:27,390
Yeah, Writin' what?

669
01:24:27,462 --> 01:24:29,726
Me own story,

670
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:33,490
Yeah, Course I will,

671
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:41,137
Don't worry, Christy, the book is... great,

672
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:44,076
Well, it's not bad,

673
01:24:44,145 --> 01:24:47,137
Do you know what I was going to call it?

674
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:50,616
<i>- What?
- The Reminiscences...</i>

675
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:54,648
Reminiscences?

676
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:57,691
<i>...of a Mental Defective.</i>

677
01:24:59,394 --> 01:25:03,888
- That's a terrible title,
- It was my blue period,

678
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:10,069
And you typed all of it with your left foot?

679
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:13,639
I didn't do it with me nose,

680
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:19,837
- I really wanted to finish it,
- You'll hear it later,

681
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:22,644
I have an appointment, I told you,

682
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,082
Is he good-lookin'?

683
01:25:26,154 --> 01:25:29,123
- Who?
- Your appointment,

684
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:33,158
Yeah, in his own way, he's nice,

685
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:39,057
Oh, it doesn't matter to me,
You can meet who you like,

686
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,797
But is he, now?

687
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:45,669
- What?
- Is he good-lookin'?

688
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:51,034
Yeah,

689
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:56,747
Are you in love with him?

690
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:08,353
You're very bloody nosy, Christy Brown,

691
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:10,624
I was only askin',

692
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:17,595
Would you like a drink?

693
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:20,470
- I'm workin', I can't,
- Later,

694
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,451
- I have a date, I told ya,
- Yeah, I forgot,

695
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:41,621
- You're a fast worker, aren't ya?
- Read your book,

696
01:26:55,176 --> 01:26:57,440
I can't with you starin' at me,

697
01:26:58,012 --> 01:27:00,173
I'll look away,

698
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:04,641
Oh, God...

699
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:20,060
- She's very pretty, isn't she?
- Prettier than that bloody picture,

700
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:29,132
Who's in there?

701
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:31,905
Ma, are you in?

702
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:35,138
Go on, then,

703
01:27:46,194 --> 01:27:49,095
Jesus! 800, Christy,

704
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:56,201
That was scrumptious, Ma, Like you,

705
01:27:57,505 --> 01:28:00,838
I fancy somethin' sweet now,
What have you for dessert, Mam?

706
01:28:00,908 --> 01:28:04,002
- Mam, what have you for dessert?
- Dessert?!

707
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:08,745
Kids, kids, do you not fancy
a drop of ice cream now?

708
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:12,775
- Yeah, ice cream, Mam!
- Yeah, Mam, get some ice cream,

709
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:18,017
Some raspberry ripple,
No, get us some Neapolitan,

710
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:19,787
All right!

711
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:22,955
- All right, all right, yeah,
- The pink and green stuff,

712
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:28,025
But just this once, mind, I've more things
to spend me money on than ice cream,

713
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,576
Jesus, Mary and Joseph, what's this?!

714
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:51,181
- What's this?
- Christy's money,

715
01:28:51,259 --> 01:28:53,386
Bring it out and count it,

716
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,430
800,

717
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:04,535
That's more money than your poor father
ever earned in a whole year,

718
01:29:05,573 --> 01:29:07,632
I can't take it,

719
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:11,473
It's for you, It's yours,

720
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:15,579
I can't take it, son,

721
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:21,454
Da was a bricklayer, Ma, and I'm a writer,

722
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:23,956
I know it's mad money,

723
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:27,959
I want you to have it,

724
01:29:30,431 --> 01:29:32,729
What would I do with it?

725
01:29:33,634 --> 01:29:39,095
Well, for a start, get yourself a dress
and a new pair of shoes,

726
01:29:41,309 --> 01:29:43,300
Will ya?

727
01:29:53,988 --> 01:29:56,456
Christy? You have a visitor,

728
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:04,992
You look well,

729
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:08,968
- So do you,
- Thank you,

730
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:11,027
Sit down,

731
01:30:18,012 --> 01:30:22,244
- Look, I won't stay very long,
- Stay as long as you like,

732
01:30:24,185 --> 01:30:26,983
I need to ask you a favor,

733
01:30:27,054 --> 01:30:29,045
What?

734
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:32,118
A benefit,

735
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:36,120
- Where?
- Lord Castlewelland's,

736
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:39,325
Him?! He's mad,

737
01:30:43,004 --> 01:30:45,996
- Posh,
- Filthy rich,

738
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:52,477
Look, I know you don't like appearing
in public, but... it's for a good cause,

739
01:30:53,481 --> 01:30:55,608
For the cripples,

740
01:30:55,683 --> 01:31:01,246
- For the cripples,
- Yeah, I'll try to behave meself,

741
01:31:03,524 --> 01:31:07,961
- You sure it won't upset you too much?
- So I'll anesthetize meself,

742
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:11,521
No, Not too much,

743
01:31:13,901 --> 01:31:16,062
How's Peter?

744
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:56,533
- We have to get goin', Christy,
- Yeah,

745
01:32:01,582 --> 01:32:05,279
What do you think? Too much self-pity?

746
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:10,518
No, I think he's a lovely man,
and not in the least sentimental,

747
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:13,585
Mary, do you really think so?

748
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:15,652
Yeah,

749
01:32:16,631 --> 01:32:20,328
- And would you go out with him?
- Certainly,

750
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:22,494
<i>Now listen, everyone...</i>

751
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:25,471
<i>So you'd go out with me?</i>

752
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:29,067
<i>- ... Christy Brown,
- I might, Shh, he's talkin' about ya,</i>

753
01:32:29,644 --> 01:32:33,307
I want to introduce you
to one of the brav...

754
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:36,782
Well, no, no, quite the bravest chap
I've ever come across,

755
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:41,413
Yes, well, now when
Christy Brown was born

756
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:44,788
the doctors told his mother
that... just no good...

757
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:49,922
<i>- Stay with us for a couple of hours,
- ... a vegetable for all of his life,</i>

758
01:32:50,364 --> 01:32:55,165
But Bridget Brown,
she wouldn't take that, oh, no,

759
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:57,397
Would you go out with me tonight?

760
01:32:58,706 --> 01:33:01,436
I told you, Christy, I have an appointment,

761
01:33:01,509 --> 01:33:05,172
And so we have with us here tonight...

762
01:33:05,546 --> 01:33:07,844
Are ya in love with him?

763
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:12,676
What?

764
01:33:13,888 --> 01:33:16,823
I asked ya did ya love him, Mary?

765
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:21,351
<i>...introduce to you
Christy Brown, man of genius,</i>

766
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:23,727
- Mary,
- Christy,

767
01:33:24,498 --> 01:33:29,367
Mary, I asked you a question, Do ya?

768
01:33:29,904 --> 01:33:33,465
- It's none of your business,
- So you won't answer me?

769
01:33:34,075 --> 01:33:36,908
- Why should I?
- What are you afraid of?

770
01:33:36,978 --> 01:33:41,108
You imagine that people are afraid of ya,
I'm not afraid of ya, OK?

771
01:33:41,182 --> 01:33:45,551
- You're afraid of yourself,
- Aw, come on, Look, just...

772
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,248
- You're afraid of me,
- We can't talk about this now,

773
01:33:48,322 --> 01:33:51,314
Why can't we talk now?
Now is a good enough time for me,

774
01:33:51,392 --> 01:33:55,021
- I'll see you again sometime,
- I've heard that before, Mary,

775
01:33:55,096 --> 01:33:59,089
Why is it always "some fuckin' time"?
Mary, stay,

776
01:34:02,003 --> 01:34:03,994
Stay!

777
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:13,637
Christy,

778
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:17,644
We've got to go,

779
01:34:25,393 --> 01:34:28,885
Take me out to the firing squad, so,

780
01:35:08,436 --> 01:35:13,533
I must say, I'm honored to be asked to
give voice to the words of Christy Brown,

781
01:35:17,344 --> 01:35:22,407
"I was born in the Rotunda Hospital,
on June 5th, 1932,"

782
01:35:24,118 --> 01:35:30,921
"There were 22 children in all,
of which 13 survived,"

783
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:37,425
<i>"It would not be true to say
that I am no longer lonely. "</i>

784
01:35:37,498 --> 01:35:39,557
<i>"I have made myself articulate</i>

785
01:35:39,633 --> 01:35:42,124
<i>and understood to people
in many parts of the world,</i>

786
01:35:42,203 --> 01:35:47,505
<i>and this is something we all wish to do
whether we're crippled or not. "</i>

787
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:50,370
"Yet, like everyone else,

788
01:35:50,444 --> 01:35:54,744
I am acutely conscious sometimes
of my own isolation,

789
01:35:55,349 --> 01:35:58,182
even in the midst of people,

790
01:35:58,252 --> 01:36:03,155
and I often give up hope of ever being
able to really communicate with them,"

791
01:36:03,224 --> 01:36:05,488
Sheila, what's the matter with Christy?

792
01:36:05,559 --> 01:36:10,121
"... that every writer or artist must
experience in the creative mood

793
01:36:10,197 --> 01:36:12,893
if he is to create anything at all,"

794
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:17,632
"It's like a black cloud
sweeping down on me unexpectedly,

795
01:36:18,305 --> 01:36:22,969
cutting me off from others,
a sort of deaf-muteness,"

796
01:36:28,015 --> 01:36:34,477
"I lay back in my chair while my old
left foot beat time to a new rhythm,"

797
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:39,582
"Now I could relax
and enjoy myself completely,"

798
01:36:40,594 --> 01:36:42,824
"I was at peace,"

799
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:45,722
"Happy,"

800
01:36:59,947 --> 01:37:02,507
Come on, Ma, stand up,

801
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:06,309
Mother,

802
01:37:06,954 --> 01:37:09,422
Mother, come here,

803
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:11,822
Ah, Christy, no, don't,

804
01:37:40,921 --> 01:37:43,685
Give us one of them flowers, Ma,

805
01:38:00,441 --> 01:38:03,410
- Are you not comin' in the car, Christy?
- No,

806
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:06,310
You're mad, Christy! It's great,

807
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:10,043
Get in the car before I kick your arse,

808
01:38:10,117 --> 01:38:12,312
Good luck, Christy,

809
01:38:21,462 --> 01:38:23,794
<i>Good night, Christy,</i>

810
01:38:23,864 --> 01:38:25,855
Good night, Ma,

811
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,571
Go on, I'm all right,

812
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:39,641
Will ya get in the car now, Ma? I'm fine,

813
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:47,451
Good night, Christy,

814
01:38:47,521 --> 01:38:50,388
- Be careful,
- Ah, you're not me Da, Tom,

815
01:38:50,457 --> 01:38:54,416
- You take it easy, Christy,
- Take it easy yourself,

816
01:38:54,795 --> 01:38:56,786
Let's go,

817
01:38:59,633 --> 01:39:02,261
Christy, Now, tuck that under you,

818
01:39:03,037 --> 01:39:05,471
Great stuff,

819
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:09,967
I hope to see you again,

820
01:39:10,044 --> 01:39:13,207
<i>Yes, I hope to see you again, Christy,</i>

821
01:39:15,549 --> 01:39:17,915
Before closing time,

822
01:39:59,393 --> 01:40:01,884
- I thought I'd lost ya,
- Not at all,

823
01:40:01,962 --> 01:40:06,262
You can just see
Joyce's Tower down there,

824
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:11,134
And that's where JM Synge was born,
at the foot of the mountains,

825
01:40:13,273 --> 01:40:15,639
What'll we drink to?

826
01:40:17,277 --> 01:40:19,268
Let's drink to Dublin,

827
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:21,837
To Dublin? Why?

828
01:40:23,417 --> 01:40:26,147
Because Christy Brown was born there,
