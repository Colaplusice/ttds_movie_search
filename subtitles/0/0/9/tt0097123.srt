00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,520
We're all very proud of
Judah Rosenthal's philanthropic efforts.

3
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,680
His endless hours of fundraising
for the hospital, the new medical centre,

4
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,880
and now the ophthalmology wing which,
until this year, had just been a dream.

5
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,400
But it's Judah Rosenthal, our friend,
that we most appreciate.

6
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,240
The husband, the father,
the golf companion.

7
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,800
- Naturally for a medical problem...
- You're blushing, darling.

8
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,880
...weekends or holidays.

9
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,640
But you can also call Judah to find out
which is the best restaurant in Paris.

10
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,440
Or Athens.

11
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,200
Or which hotel to stay at in Moscow.

12
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,160
Or the best recording
of a particular Mozart symphony.

13
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,480
My father is so nervous
about having to get up and speak.

14
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,760
I knew he was nervous when you didn't
eat any of those cocktail weenies.

15
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,640
He was so courageous all week,
then suddenly, tonight, stage fright.

16
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,560
Really, Judah, you were fine
till you got home from work today.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,880
- Any mail?
- It's exactly where I left it this morning.

18
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,040
I haven't had a free second all day.

19
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,320
If you're gonna take a shower, you better
do it, because I have to use it, too.

20
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,360
I dread making that speech tonight.

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,840
Dear Miriam Rosenthal.

22
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,960
I'm at the lowest point of my life
as I write you this letter.

23
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,240
I wish to cause no suffering

24
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,840
but, because I'm going through pure hell,
I ask if you can meet me one time.

25
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,200
Your husband and I
are more than intimate friends

26
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,040
and have been deeply in love
for over two years now.

27
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,560
This must be faced, as there are so many
ramifications and complications.

28
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,280
Many promises were made, etc.

29
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,560
I need an open exchange
with you to clear things.

30
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,640
For all three of us to go on,

31
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,760
the situation has got to be
confronted in some fashion.

32
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Please contact me at this number.

33
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,160
I want what's best for everyone.

34
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Dolores Paley.

35
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,360
That the new ophthalmology wing is now
a reality is not just a tribute to me,

36
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,000
but to a spirit of community, generosity,

37
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,000
of mutual caring

38
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,000
and answered prayers.

39
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,520
Now, it's funny I use the term "answered
prayers". You see, I'm a man of science.

40
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
I've always been a sceptic.

41
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,600
But I was raised quite religiously.
And while I challenged it, even as a child,

42
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,680
some of that feeling
must have stuck with me.

43
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,360
I remember my father telling me
"The eyes of God are on us always."

44
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,200
The eyes of God.

45
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,960
What a phrase to a young boy.

46
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,800
I mean, what were God's eyes like?

47
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,880
Unimaginably penetrating,
intense eyes, I assumed.

48
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,120
And I wonder if it was just a coincidence
that I made my specialty ophthalmology.

49
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,040
I'm so proud of you, Judah.
Sharon is. We all are.

50
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,800
Let's get one of
Miriam and Judah together.

51
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,960
- Why did you write that letter?
- You know why.

52
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,640
- You wanna destroy my life? My family?
- I want her to know what you're like.

53
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,320
It was lying on the table all day.
By a miracle, I got it first.

54
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,360
You told me over and over again
you'd leave Miriam.

55
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,840
- I didn't!
- You did!

56
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,600
- I gave up business opportunities.
- Pipe dreams.

57
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,600
- And other men wanted me.
- What do you want from me?

58
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,960
- You think this was easy?
- I want what you told me you wanted.

59
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,800
To be together. Otherwise
I don't know what I'll do.

60
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,960
I'll jump out the window, I swear!

61
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,160
You've been my whole life for two years.
I can't go back to the way things were.

62
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,680
I was at a low point when we met.
You changed that.

63
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,640
I never said I'd leave Miriam.
It's wishful thinking.

64
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,880
"There's no passion. It's boring."
Those are your words.

65
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,920
Unless you were lying to me
or there's more to this that I don't know.

66
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,520
- Have you met someone else?
- What? Oh, come on.

67
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,000
- For God's sake, Dolores. Dolores...
- What?

68
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,680
Now, look. I've lived with her 25 years.
The roots are very deep.

69
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,680
I can't go on leading two lives.

70
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,320
Well, you're not doing her any favour by
pretending. I'm not gonna be without you.

71
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,080
I'm not gonna let this happen to me
without a fight. I wanna speak to Miriam.

72
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,640
- Dolores, nothing is happening. All right?
- No!

73
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,200
Yes! Now listen to me, please. Just
bear with me. We'll work something out.

74
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Let me get my thoughts together.

75
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,560
Just don't do anything rash.

76
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Dolores...

77
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
What?

78
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
It's gonna be OK.

79
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,240
Oh, God.

80
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,000
You were gonna throw me aside
like a squeezed lemon!

81
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,680
- Don't dramatise this!
- I've given you the best years of my life

82
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,520
and you were willing to go on and on.
Get out of here.

83
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,640
I know you for what you are.
I'm lucky I found you out.

84
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Those are my clothes!

85
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,320
That was great, wasn't it?
With the tuxedos and the evening gowns.

86
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,760
- Great.
- It was wonderful to live like that.

87
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,000
This is awful. Let me see
if I can get a cab. You stay here.

88
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,680
- Wanna see a movie again tomorrow?
- Sure, Uncle Cliff.

89
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,160
Jesus.

90
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,360
Unless... Maybe we should make it
a museum day. You know?

91
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,040
I promised your father on his deathbed
I'd give you a well-rounded education.

92
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,880
We probably shouldn't go to the movies
every day, just once in a while.

93
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,840
Even though I'd love to. You know?

94
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,520
So while we wait for a cab,
I'll give you your lesson for today. OK?

95
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,680
Your lesson is this: Don't listen
to what your schoolteachers tell you.

96
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,800
Just see what they look like. That's how
you'll know what life is gonna be like.

97
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,160
You heard it here first. I think I see a cab.

98
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,440
If we run quickly, we can kick the crutch
from that old lady and get it.

99
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,080
- I'm back!
- Where were you?

100
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,920
You know. Just out and around.

101
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,560
- You took your niece to the movies again.
- I'm crazy about that kid. She's just great.

102
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,320
My brother's in town. He wants us
to join him for a dinner party tonight.

103
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,520
Jesus.

104
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,760
- Please. You gonna make another scene?
- I didn't last time.

105
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,920
You did. You were not nice
and your resentment showed.

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I don't resent him. I told you that.

107
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,240
I think he's a pompous ass.
You don't see it cos you love him.

108
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,240
- What are you muttering?
- Nothing.

109
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,440
You are. You're running down Lester.

110
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,120
- Hey, I like your brother Ben.
- Sure. You're not jealous of Ben.

111
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,920
You think I'm jealous of Lester
cos he's a TV producer?

112
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,840
No, because he's a much-honoured,
highly respected multimillionaire.

113
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,840
- And he does what you'd like to be doing.
- I can't watch his stuff. It's sub-mental.

114
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,280
- He wants to talk to you about a job.
- I don't need a job.

115
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,240
I got honourable mention
at that festival in... in...

116
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,240
Cincinnati? The documentary film
festival? This is what you're clinging to?

117
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,880
Everybody got honourable mention
who showed up.

118
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,840
Boy, things have really
changed around here.

119
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,000
Wendy, Cliff, come here.
I want you to meet Lisa.

120
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,440
My sister Wendy.
My brother-in-law Clifford.

121
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,920
Lisa Crosley.
She's starring in my new series.

122
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,560
- Not really starring.
- You're one of the stars.

123
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,000
It's an ensemble.
Tell 'em who you're playing.

124
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,640
- Hello, Lester.
- Hi, darling. So glad you came.

125
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,800
Thank you for inviting me.
It's a beautiful party.

126
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,120
Thank you. Why don't you have a drink?
Be right there.

127
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,400
She gave a bundle
to the Museum of Broadcasting.

128
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,000
She plays a...

129
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,440
A lawyer for the ACLU, with a husband
who writes for a conservative magazine.

130
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,320
- It gives us a chance to get into issues.
- We'll try to be fair but, knowing Lester,

131
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,440
- it'll be heavily slanted to the left.
- Let's hope so.

132
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,800
- You know we're gonna shoot it here?
- You'll be here? I couldn't be happier.

133
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,840
Me, too. I love this town.

134
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,640
Out there it's such a Mickey Mouse
environment. I'm not interested.

135
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,120
- That's why I'm in this week.
- Hello, Lester.

136
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,840
I wanna talk to you. Don't go away.

137
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,600
A bunch of us are getting together
to build major studio space

138
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,800
for production right here in the city.

139
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,040
In fact... I'm sorry.
Just give me one second.

140
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,840
Idea for series:

141
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,040
A wealthy builder always trying to realise
grandiose dreams a la Donald Trump.

142
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,320
- To be shot in New York.
- Look who's here.

143
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,440
This is my brother Ben.
Ben. Carol. Come here.

144
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,320
Hi, Cliff.

145
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,960
- How are your eyes?
- Not so good. It's not so optimistic.

146
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,240
- You're kidding.
- I've been seeing Dr Rosenthal.

147
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,440
Lester, I'm sorry. Don't you
want to talk to Clifford?

148
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,560
Yeah. Step into my office.

149
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,120
- Hi. I'm Lisa.
- Hi. We didn't meet. I'm sorry.

150
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,880
So, are you in TV, too?

151
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,520
No. No, I'm a rabbi.

152
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,560
You don't have to wear
an outfit or anything?

153
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Public television wants
to do a documentary on me.

154
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,880
Follow me around,
the way I talk, the way I think.

155
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,720
It's part of their Creative Mind series.

156
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,160
So... I told them about you.

157
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,840
Thank you. But I'm workin'
on a thing of my own. A little film.

158
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,360
Yeah, Wendy told me. A film about some
philosophy professor, which is admirable.

159
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,120
But I'm offering you the chance to earn
decent money and reach a big audience.

160
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,400
The last thing you need
is for me to be your biographer.

161
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,320
I make these little films
on toxic waste and starving children...

162
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,600
Look, I'll be frank with you.
You're not my first choice.

163
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,560
I'm doing this for Wendy. She says
you haven't worked in a long time.

164
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,160
I've worked. It's just that
nobody's paying me.

165
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,840
Look, I know you don't respect what I do.
But I've got a closet full of Emmys.

166
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,480
OK, you think that's bullshit. Fine.
I understand.

167
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,760
I don't know. Maybe I could
use the money to finish my movie.

168
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,840
I do have some debts and things.

169
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,640
Idea for farce:

170
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,400
A poor loser agrees to do
the story of a great man's life

171
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,640
and in the process
comes to learn deep values.

172
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,560
- What are you doing in Boston?
- I'm lecturing at a symposium.

173
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,160
Incidentally, my name's Dolores.

174
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,880
- Hello, Dolores.
- Hello.

175
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,120
- Pretty name.
- Thank you very much.

176
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,960
- Do you go to Boston often?
- Not very often, no.

177
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,400
- I don't know anyone in Boston, actually.
- Really?

178
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,920
- Good morning.
- Hi. Miss Paley called. Said it was urgent.

179
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,040
Why did you phone me?
I told you I'd call you.

180
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,840
I couldn't help it.
I was going out of my skin.

181
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,040
I have to see you later. I have to.

182
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,840
OK.

183
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,000
After work is OK.

184
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,160
I see it.

185
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,880
Yeah. I see it.

186
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,840
Oh, God.

187
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,440
What?

188
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,960
I need to take a minute.

189
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,080
What's wrong, Judah?

190
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm in such trouble, Ben.

191
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,480
What is it?

192
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,080
I need to talk to someone.

193
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,440
Sure.

194
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,440
We've known each other many years.
You're a religious man. OK, I'm not.

195
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,560
We've differed on many points,
but you're somebody I do respect.

196
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,080
- May I confide in you?
- Of course.

197
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,160
Go ahead. Everything's confidential.

198
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,320
I've done a foolish thing.

199
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,800
Senseless, vain, dumb.

200
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,960
Another woman.

201
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,680
Maybe I was flattered, vulnerable.

202
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,240
Maybe because she was
helpless and alone.

203
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,720
Now my life's about to go up in smoke.

204
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,760
- Can't you break it off?
- The woman won't allow it.

205
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,840
She's young. She's very unstable.
She's an hysteric.

206
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,280
And vindictive.

207
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,560
And it's my fault.
I instigated it. I prolonged it.

208
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,400
Many times I tried to back off
but I was too weak.

209
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,920
But I promised her nothing.

210
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,920
Or did I?
See, I don't even know any more.

211
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,400
In the heat of passion, you say things.

212
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,240
But, after two years of
shameful deceit in this double life,

213
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,320
I awakened as if from a dream
and realised what I'd be losing.

214
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,720
It's called wisdom.
It comes to some suddenly.

215
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,520
We realise the difference between
what's real and deep and lasting

216
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,160
versus the superficial
payoff of the moment.

217
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,360
You know, I kidded myself about
loving her but deep down I knew.

218
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,320
And knowing, I behaved selfishly.
For pleasure, for adventure, for lust.

219
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,320
Sometimes, when there's real love
and true acknowledgement of a mistake,

220
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,000
there can be forgiveness, too.

221
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,800
I know Miriam.

222
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,680
Her values, her feelings. Our place
among our friends and colleagues.

223
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,080
But what choice do you have
if the woman is going to tell her?

224
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,240
You have to confess the wrong
and hope for understanding.

225
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,280
Maybe Miriam was responsible
in some ways, too.

226
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,280
You have to discuss it
and hope for the best.

227
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,200
Maybe you can never
go back to the old life,

228
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,920
but maybe there's a new one with
maturity and understanding. Maybe...

229
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,000
Maybe even a richer one.

230
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,760
You know what's funny?

231
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,840
Our entire adult lives,

232
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,800
you and I have been having this same
conversation in one form or another.

233
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,960
It's a fundamental difference
in the way we view the world.

234
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,800
You see it as harsh and
empty of values and pitiless,

235
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,680
and I couldn't go on living
if I didn't feel with all my heart

236
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,400
a moral structure with real meaning and

237
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,040
forgiveness,
and some kind of higher power.

238
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,400
Otherwise there's no basis
to know how to live.

239
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,480
And I know you well enough to know that
the spark of that notion is inside you, too.

240
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,640
Now you're talkin' to me
like your congregation.

241
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,520
It's true. We went from a small infidelity
to the meaning of existence.

242
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:06,240
Miriam won't think two years of scheming
and dishonesty is a... is a small infidelity.

243
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:25,280
How can you do it? I give up.
God, you're in such wonderful shape.

244
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,560
- For a man my age?
- For any age.

245
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,800
- I was quite athletic as a young student.
- You still make love like a young student.

246
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,840
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

247
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,480
You know, I don't think
we should do this here.

248
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,720
- Why not? We're all alone.
- I don't know. I feel a little self-conscious.

249
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,520
Let's go back to the cottage and light
a fire. You can play me the Schumann.

250
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,080
Schubert. Schumann is flowery.

251
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,000
Schubert is...
He reminds me of you. The sad one.

252
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,320
Schubert. God, you have to teach me all
that. I'm so ignorant in classical music.

253
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,600
I'll teach you.
Someday we'll have a lot of time.

254
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,920
Would you like a drink?

255
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,760
Yeah. Fix me whatever you're having.

256
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,920
Why'd you call the house last night
and hang up, Del?

257
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,960
I'm not playing games, Judah.

258
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,440
Just because you've decided we're
through doesn't mean I'll roll over and die.

259
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,120
What the hell happened to us? I mean...

260
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,240
We had a wonderful few years.
We both knew it couldn't go on for ever.

261
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,360
- I gave up things for you.
- Come on. That's poppycock.

262
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,440
Don't give me that, will ya?
For God's sakes.

263
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,800
There were no business opportunities.
It's all in your head.

264
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,120
No lovers beggin' for your hand.

265
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,480
I prevented nothing. I...

266
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,560
Can we not argue? I just wanted to talk.

267
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,640
I'm just so rattled.

268
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,160
I had an idea.

269
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,440
I thought if we could get away, just
for a little while, on one of our trips.

270
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,360
Our trips are
the warmest memories I have.

271
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,760
Not just in our relationship, but
some of the loveliest times I've ever had.

272
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,760
You're always so much more relaxed
away from home.

273
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,000
You come to life.
Your whole face changes.

274
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,200
I thought if we could just get away
to Boston or Washington,

275
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,400
- just without any preconceived notions.
- I can't go away, Del.

276
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,080
- Just a weekend.
- I can't, Del.

277
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,160
- Why not?
- I can't.

278
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,000
- You won't.
- Of course I won't. Right.

279
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,040
Why not?

280
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,520
Because you're very unrealistic.
You know that?

281
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,760
Sit... Sit down for a second. Let's talk.

282
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,520
Look. I've been...

283
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,640
I've been thinking, too.

284
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,720
And it occurs to me,

285
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,400
if I caused you to miss any opportunities
that might have been lucrative for you,

286
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,960
I'm perfectly prepared to reimburse you.

287
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,400
- I don't want to feel I've cost you any...
- I'm not after your goddamn money.

288
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,960
I want to speak to Miriam.
It's her problem, too.

289
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,440
- I want her to know the truth.
- Keep her out of it. All right?

290
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,040
I think she should know
her husband is a liar and an embezzler.

291
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,600
Don't you dare call me an embezzler.

292
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,280
I'm not blind. I know what went on with
those philanthropies and your stocks.

293
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,400
I took nothing. Not a nickel.
My conscience is completely clear.

294
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,720
You needed money
to cover your losses. I was there.

295
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,520
OK, OK. I needed some temporary help.
I mean, for Christ's sake.

296
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,920
After a life of hard work, a man doesn't
let himself go down the toilet. Does he?

297
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,040
And moving funds is not stealing.

298
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,320
Without telling anyone?

299
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,240
Every cent was accounted for,
with interest.

300
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,720
I don't think they would see it that way.

301
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,120
So this is what you plan on doing? You're
gonna hold on to me with threats, right?

302
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,440
Stupid threats and slander.
This is your idea of love, right?

303
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,680
I will not be tossed out.
I want to speak to Miriam.

304
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,000
Think, for Christ's sake! Think what
the hell you're doing to me. Please.

305
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,200
I can't figure it out.

306
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,280
I need you.

307
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,880
Del...

308
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,840
I love New York.
I was born in that building.

309
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,200
Behind the guy... the statue there.
The guy on the pedestal.

310
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,160
I love New York. It's like thousands of
straight lines just lookin' for a punch line.

311
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,760
And what makes New York
such a funny place is that

312
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,440
there's so much tension and pain
and misery and craziness here.

313
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,520
And that's the first part of comedy.
But you gotta get some distance from it.

314
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,400
The thing to remember about comedy is:
If it bends, it's funny.

315
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,360
If it breaks, it's not funny.

316
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,720
So you gotta get back from the pain.
See what I mean?

317
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,160
They asked me up at Harvard, a bunch
of kids asked me "What's comedy?"

318
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,840
So I said... And this is part of
what I said about getting back from it.

319
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,840
I said "Comedy is tragedy plus time."

320
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,720
Tragedy plus time.

321
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,600
The night Lincoln was shot, you couldn't
make a joke about it. You just couldn't.

322
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Now, time has gone by,
and now it's fair game.

323
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,520
See what I mean? It's tragedy plus time.

324
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,640
- OK, we're out.
- That's it? So fast?

325
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,280
I shot up ten rolls on your first question.

326
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,280
I've gotta get to CBS anyway.
We'll start this again tomorrow.

327
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,880
Just remember what I was saying.
What do you think?

328
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,880
- Excellent. Absolutely.
- I think I'm too cute.

329
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,200
I'll be more relaxed tomorrow.
I'll do that tragedy stuff.

330
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,960
- This is Halley Reed for Mr Kurnitz.
- Would you excuse me one second?

331
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,520
Listen, if you play your cards right,
you could have my body.

332
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,640
- Wouldn't you rather leave it to science?
- I offer you my heart, you squash it.

333
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,240
Come on. When are you gonna quit
this organisation, come work for me?

334
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,040
- You'd fire me. I'm much too opinionated.
- No, no.

335
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,160
- That's OK. I'll wait.
- I like mental stimulation.

336
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,400
- You tried shock therapy?
- That's good. That's funny.

337
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,200
- Listen, Lester. We've gotta go.
- OK. I'll be right with you.

338
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,440
- It's five o'clock.
- Wait in the car.

339
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,600
- Would you please come?
- Yes. Wait in the car, Arthur.

340
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,840
Yes, I was holding for Mr Kurnitz,
please. It's Halley Reed.

341
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,520
Why don't you come with me
down to Barbados?

342
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,560
We'll swim, we'll get some sun.

343
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,640
Sorry. I freckle.

344
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,000
That's my best shot. I can't do any better.

345
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,000
- That's OK. I'll wait.
- Think about it. OK? Please.

346
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,080
Talk to you tomorrow.

347
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,480
Yeah, it's Halley Reed. You cut me off.

348
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,400
- OK.
- Excuse me. We haven't officially met.

349
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,560
- I'm Halley Reed, an associate producer.
- I'm Clifford Stern.

350
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,840
Can I ask you what I asked the producer?
What do you bother with this guy for?

351
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,840
He's such a pompous bore,
and your show does such great profiles.

352
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,600
Just between you and me,
I wanted to do Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

353
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,480
- That's perfect.
- They like a little variety.

354
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,240
- He is an American phenomenon.
- Yeah, but so is acid rain.

355
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,320
Boy, you really don't like him, do you?

356
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,240
I love him like a brother -
David Greenglass.

357
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,640
So why are you doing this? It's unusual
for them to bring in an outside person.

358
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,680
Yes, I know. I'm doing it
strictly for the money.

359
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,840
I'm trying to make my own documentary.

360
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,160
I'm doing a profile on a guy who'd be
absolutely perfect for your show.

361
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,680
- Yeah? Who's that?
- His name is Louis Levy.

362
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,760
Do you have a little time?

363
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,080
The unique thing that happened

364
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,320
to the early Israelites

365
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,400
was that they conceived a God that cares.

366
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
He cares but, at the same time,

367
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,480
he also demands
that you behave morally.

368
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,560
But here comes the paradox.

369
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,480
What's one of the first things
that that God asks?

370
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,800
That God asks Abraham
to sacrifice his only son,

371
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,200
his beloved son, to him.

372
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,120
In other words,
in spite of millennia of efforts,

373
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,800
we have not succeeded to create
a really and entirely loving image of God.

374
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,600
This was beyond our capacity to imagine.

375
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,440
- Boy, he's really interesting.
- A fascinating guy.

376
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,000
- He could be wonderful for the series.
- You wanna dump Lester and do him?

377
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,920
- Cos I would love to...
- We can't dump Lester.

378
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,320
But I think I could talk them into
a little financing for you.

379
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,560
And if all this comes together right,
and it should,

380
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,960
we got some free spots
in the fall schedule.

381
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,160
Wonderful. For me to get on your series
would be such a feather in my cap.

382
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,760
That would be
the biggest audience I ever had.

383
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,440
Great. Let's work on it.
Let's make it happen.

384
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,080
Really? You know, even though we just
met, I've taken an instant liking to you.

385
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,880
And I to him.

386
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,960
Hi. I thought I'd come by
on my way home. I got Jenny a present.

387
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,760
- Is that you, Uncle Cliff?
- Yes, Jenny. I got you something.

388
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,080
I got you a great book,
an absolutely terrific book.

389
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,600
How are you? I got you this great book
with great pictures of old New York in it.

390
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,120
- Look at this. This is old Fifth Avenue.
- This is great.

391
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
Carriages and top hats. I told you.

392
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,600
There's a section on speakeasies,
which is really interesting.

393
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,520
That's the Flatiron Building,
which is very famous.

394
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,480
I'm in a great mood.
I had a creative breakthrough.

395
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,200
I heard you got some action
on your ad in the personals.

396
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,120
- This is the old Madison Square Garden.
- Jen... Don't you have some homework?

397
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,560
- Yeah, I have to go do that.
- We'll look at this later. Great pictures.

398
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,240
Cliff...

399
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
What's the matter?

400
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,600
- I'm a wreck.
- What is it?

401
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,080
- I'm a wreck.
- Barbara...

402
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Barbara, what's the matter?

403
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,440
I feel sick.

404
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,640
- What is it?
- I've been shaking like this for days.

405
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
What's wrong?

406
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,120
I've been going out with this man
that I met through the personal columns.

407
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,960
Very attractive.

408
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
It was very nice.

409
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,680
I went out with him three times.

410
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,400
He was never fresh.
He was always a perfect gentleman.

411
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,680
So... we both came back here,

412
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,960
and Jenny was away.

413
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,600
She was sleeping over
at a friend's house.

414
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,800
And it was, like, one o'clock
in the morning or something

415
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,280
and we both had had a little to drink.

416
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,440
You know, I wanna tie you to the bed.

417
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,560
- Really?
- And rip your dress off.

418
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,880
Have you ever been bound up,
tied up and made love to?

419
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,880
I'm... I'm a...

420
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,960
I'm a sensible gal.

421
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
No more you're not.

422
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,720
God, Murray. God...

423
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,400
Barbara, I'm shocked at what I'm hearing.

424
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,320
You're my sister.
A nice, middle-class mother.

425
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,760
What are you telling me?

426
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,960
I couldn't move.
I was tied tightly to the bedposts.

427
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,720
Jesus. By a stra...
a guy that you didn't know?

428
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,960
And now you're gonna tell me
that he robbed you, right?

429
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
No.

430
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,920
He got on top of me and... and...

431
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,040
- And what?
- I can't say it. I just... I can't say it.

432
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,360
What? Tell me. What's so terrible?

433
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,120
He sat over me...
and went to the bathroom.

434
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
That's so disgusting!

435
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,800
Oh, my God! That's the worst thing
I ever heard in my life.

436
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,440
- Then he took his clothes and left.
- Barbara! You idiot!

437
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,560
This guy could've cut your throat!
Murdered you!

438
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,600
- I would've preferred it.
- Jesus. You're such a dope!

439
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,200
I wish I could have sympathy for this.

440
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,640
That's so easy for you to say,
but I'm so lonely.

441
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,360
You don't know what it's like
to be by yourself all the time.

442
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,880
I'm sure you're lonely. I know it's painful.

443
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,640
But promise me that you're never gonna
place another ad again. It's ridiculous!

444
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,720
My whole life is passing me by,
and I don't have anyone to love.

445
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,560
I know that's so hard for you
to comprehend because you're married.

446
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
But it's so lonely out there.

447
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,680
I mean, you have a wife,
and you love her, and that's so nice.

448
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,200
Let me tell you. Things are not so good
between my wife and myself,

449
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,280
just so you don't get any illusions.

450
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,960
We've been coming apart for the last year.

451
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:18,800
It's just that neither of us has the energy
to do anything about it. It's not so great.

452
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,600
A strange man defecated on my sister.

453
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,440
Why?

454
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,040
I don't know.

455
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,760
Is there any reason I could give you
that would answer that satisfactorily?

456
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,800
You know, it's just so...

457
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,920
Human sexuality is just...
it's so mysterious.

458
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,800
Which I guess is... you know.
I guess it's good in a way.

459
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,360
Yeah, well, I gotta be up at seven.

460
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,720
I knew it had to be some deep,
dark secret for you to stoop to call me,

461
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,720
- to actually invite me to your home.
- Jack, who should I turn to but a brother?

462
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,400
- I've been there for you.
- I'm here, aren't I?

463
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,120
Don't make sharp cracks. I didn't
stoop to call you. I'm in serious trouble.

464
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,920
She won't take money.
She won't listen to reason.

465
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,840
I even thought of telling everything to
Miriam, but she could never live with it.

466
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,320
Add to that her blabbing
about my financial indiscretions.

467
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,640
Not that I stole, but I was indiscreet.

468
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,560
And, if they look hard enough,
who knows what they'll find?

469
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,920
- What would you like me to do?
- I don't know, but she's killing me.

470
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,360
Want me to have somebody talk to her?

471
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,920
- Like what?
- Straighten her out.

472
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,000
What do you mean? Threaten her?
That's all I need.

473
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,240
How else do you expect
to keep her quiet?

474
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,320
I don't know. Jack, I don't know.

475
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,200
- Well...
- Christ, Jack. What are you suggesting?

476
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
What did you call me for?

477
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,000
I don't know. I hoped you'd have
more experience with something like this.

478
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,080
You called because you need some dirty
work done. That's all you ever call for.

479
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
Look how bitter you are.

480
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,440
You've staked me plenty of times.
I don't forget my obligations.

481
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,520
Threatening will only make it worse, Jack.

482
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,440
OK. Forget about it.
What do you want me to say?

483
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,480
How the hell can I forget about it?
I'm fighting for my life.

484
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,560
This woman's gonna destroy
everything I've built.

485
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:54,600
That's what I'm saying. If she won't listen
to reason, then you go on to the next step.

486
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,480
Threats? Violence?
What are we talking about here?

487
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,680
She can be gotten rid of. I know people.
Money'll buy whatever's necessary.

488
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,480
I won't even comment on that.
That's mind-boggling.

489
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,720
What did you want me to do
when you called me?

490
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,800
Not to do dirty work,
despite what you think.

491
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,280
Anyway, it's gone beyond
just Miriam now.

492
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,520
She's talking financial doings.

493
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,040
I'm out of ideas. I don't know what I
expected from you, Jack, but some help.

494
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,360
You know, you're not aware of
what goes on in this world.

495
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,640
You sit up here with your four acres and
your country club and your rich friends.

496
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,960
- Out there in the real world, it's different.
- Come on.

497
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,400
- I've met a lot of characters...
- I've heard these stories before.

498
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,760
...from Seventh Avenue, from Atlantic City.

499
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,800
And I'm not so high-class that I can avoid
looking at reality. I can't afford to be aloof.

500
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,360
You come to me with a hell of a problem,
and then you get high-handed on me.

501
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,080
I don't mean to be high-handed.
I haven't been sleeping. I'm irritable.

502
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,360
OK. Forget I said anything.

503
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,200
Let me just get something straight here.

504
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,680
Am I understanding you right?

505
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,760
Are you suggesting getting rid of her?

506
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,480
You won't be involved.
But I'll need some cash.

507
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,280
What will they do?

508
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,760
What'll they do? They'll handle it.

509
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,600
I can't believe I'm talking about
a human being. She's not an insect.

510
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,680
You don't just step on her.

511
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,200
I know. Playing hardball
was never your game.

512
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,360
You never liked to get your hands dirty.

513
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,440
But, apparently, this woman is for real,
and this thing isn't just gonna go away.

514
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
I can't do it.

515
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,240
I can't think that way.

516
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,600
Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know anything about it.

517
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,840
This is a work of art.

518
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,880
The ropes come off. I tie sash weights
to her ankles with soft catgut.

519
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,120
- Please! That's a horrible word.
- Get the angle on this.

520
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,720
She disappears. Two weeks, maybe three.

521
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,560
Then up she pops. None of this stuff
on her any more, no marks. A suicide.

522
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,720
- Now isn't that beautiful?
- It's loathsome.

523
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,200
- Be sure no one sees you.
- Don't worry.

524
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,920
This only happens in the movies.

525
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,040
Listen, we should get back.
Lester's gonna be leaving the hotel soon.

526
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,160
We'll make it. We've been shooting Lester
all week. I'm tired of it. We'll catch him.

527
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,560
I shouldn't have told you my weakness
is going to the movies in the daytime.

528
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,840
I go all the time with my niece.
It's wonderful. It's like playing hooky.

529
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,160
You said that yesterday and we were late.

530
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,840
We weren't late. We didn't miss anything.

531
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,080
Have another cheeseburger.
It's our lunch hour.

532
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,400
I've got everyone up at the network
very excited over Professor Levy.

533
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,960
I have some great stuff to show you later.

534
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,880
Listen.

535
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
I bought you a present.

536
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,760
Great. Now I can get rid of
my few remaining teeth.

537
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,760
# Happy birthday to you

538
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,080
# Happy birthday to you

539
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,040
A treadmill. Are you trying
to tell me something?

540
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,760
- You said you were bored with the bike.
- You may find this just as boring.

541
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,680
- I think you're in great shape already.
- Yeah, for a man my age.

542
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,000
Great to see you enjoying yourself.
You've been so depressed.

543
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,000
This thing's great for tension.

544
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,080
- I'll go get it.
- It's just like the one you saw at the club.

545
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,720
- Where are we gonna put this?
- I'm gonna have 20 men take it upstairs.

546
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,120
- It looks like a kinetic sculpture.
- It's not gonna stay down here.

547
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,400
- It tells you how many calories...
- Dad, it's for you.

548
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,480
Miss Paley.

549
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,160
- She's a patient.
- On this phone?

550
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,280
Yeah. She's going through a crisis.
I'll be right back.

551
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,880
- Why couldn't the service pick it up?
- It's probably an emergency.

552
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,120
I'm calling from the gas station
down the road from your house.

553
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,600
I can be there in five minutes.

554
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,120
I'm going to,
unless you meet me right now.

555
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,000
No, Judah. No, Judah.

556
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,760
No. I wanna talk to you in person,
or I'm coming over.

557
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,240
- Just calm down, OK?
- You said we were going away.

558
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,920
I wanna be alone with you.
And when we get back,

559
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,560
I want you to bring everything
to a conclusion with Miriam.

560
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,760
I can't go on like this! I can't wait for ever!
You don't know what it's like!

561
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,600
Maybe it would help if you
talked to somebody, like a therapist.

562
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,760
Don't trick me, Judah! Christ, I'm shaking.

563
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
Listen.

564
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,240
I brought you a birthday present.

565
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,280
I know how much you love Schubert.

566
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:36,000
Sometimes, when there's real love
and true acknowledgement of a mistake,

567
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,480
there can be forgiveness, too.

568
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
I know Miriam.

569
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,280
Her values, her feelings. Our place
among our friends and colleagues.

570
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,760
But what choice do you have
if the woman is going to tell her?

571
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,800
You have to confess the wrong
and hope for understanding.

572
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,840
I couldn't go on living
if I didn't feel with all my heart

573
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,480
a moral structure with real meaning and

574
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,200
forgiveness,
and some kind of higher power.

575
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,480
Otherwise,
there's no basis to know how to live.

576
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,640
And I know you well enough to know that
the spark of that notion is inside you, too.

577
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,640
Could you really go through with it?

578
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,360
What choice do I have, Ben?

579
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Tell me.

580
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,440
Give the people that you've hurt
a chance to forgive you.

581
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,920
Miriam won't forgive me. She'll be broken.

582
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
She worships me.

583
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,000
She'll be humiliated before our friends.
This woman plans to make a stink.

584
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,000
- Did you make promises to her?
- No.

585
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,360
Maybe I led her on more than I realised.

586
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,120
She's so emotionally hungry.

587
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,080
- But it's deeper than just Miriam now.
- Meaning financial improprieties?

588
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,320
No.

589
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,600
Maybe I... Maybe I did
make some questionable moves.

590
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,640
Only you would know that, Judah.

591
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,720
I don't any more, Ben.

592
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,000
Sometimes it's worse than...
worse than jail.

593
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,640
It's a human life.

594
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,920
You don't think God sees?

595
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,920
God is a luxury I can't afford.

596
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,800
Now you're talking like your brother Jack.

597
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,320
Jack lives in the real world.

598
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,800
You live in the kingdom of heaven.

599
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,800
I managed to keep free of that real world
but... suddenly it's found me.

600
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,080
You fool around with her for pleasure
and then, when you think it's enough,

601
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,560
you wanna sweep her under the rug?

602
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,080
There's no other solution but Jack's, Ben.

603
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,280
I push one button and
I can sleep again nights.

604
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,360
Could you sleep with that?

605
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,360
Is that who you really are?

606
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,720
I will not be destroyed
by this neurotic woman.

607
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,760
But the law, Judah.

608
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,680
Without the law, it's all darkness.

609
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,960
You sound like my father.

610
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,560
What good is the law if it prevents me
from receiving justice?

611
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,160
Is what she's doing to me just?
Is this what I deserve?

612
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,320
Jack? It's Judah.

613
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,240
I think we should move ahead
with what we discussed.

614
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,400
How much will you need?

615
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,640
Not funny. It's not funny, guys.

616
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,440
No, it's not. You're not thinking funny.
You gotta think with your ear.

617
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,720
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
Here's the difference. It's very easy.

618
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,120
If it bends, it's funny.

619
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,560
If it breaks, it's not funny.

620
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,040
It's very simple. Wait a minute. Here.

621
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,440
- Jeff, this is Alva.
- Hi. Pleased to meet you.

622
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,520
Don't... Don't shoot this part.

623
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,360
Alva will play a small part in the new
series. I don't know what. I just want her.

624
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,800
- It's wonderful. You look great.
- Thank you.

625
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,320
They love you. Wonderful. Be right out.

626
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,080
OK. Don't do that while they're shooting.
It's messing my hair up.

627
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,720
Understand what I'm saying?
Think of Oedipus. Oedipus is funny.

628
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,080
That's the structure of funny, right there.

629
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,520
"Who did this terrible thing?"
"Oh, God - it was me." That's funny.

630
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:06,680
But the difference is... Not while they're
shooting. What the hell are you doing?

631
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:12,600
You will notice that what we are aiming at

632
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,400
when we fall in love
is a very strange paradox.

633
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,120
The paradox consists of the fact
that, when we fall in love,

634
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,440
we are seeking to re-find

635
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,840
all or some of the people
to whom we were attached as children.

636
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,160
On the other hand, we ask our beloved

637
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,840
to correct all of the wrongs

638
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,080
that these early parents or siblings
inflicted upon us.

639
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,320
So that love contains in it
the contradiction:

640
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,000
The attempt to return to the past

641
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,040
and the attempt to undo the past.

642
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,200
See? No limos, no bimbos,
no awards or anything.

643
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,800
This guy's just a thinker, an intellect.

644
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,720
I was just thinking, when you show this to
the people that make the final decision,

645
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,560
you should emphasise
his overall view of life.

646
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,560
It's great. It's life-affirming.
They love a positive statement.

647
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:14,560
See, this is what I need. A little interest
in my work. A little encouragement. It's...

648
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,000
Let me ask you something. I got a bottle
of champagne as a prize, from Paris.

649
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:24,640
I got honourable mention for a little
documentary I did on leukaemia, and...

650
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,960
- You want some champagne?
- I never say no to champagne, or caviar.

651
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,960
OK. That's perfect. I have no caviar.
I have oat bran. It's better for your heart.

652
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,760
He was very eloquent on the subject
of love, didn't you think?

653
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,960
Yeah. I wish I'd read him
before I got married. You know?

654
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,280
Would've saved me
a gall bladder operation.

655
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,800
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

656
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,680
You know, he wrote a very interesting
book on human relationships.

657
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,840
He speaks very, very highly
of love at first sight.

658
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,520
My ex-husband and I fell in love at first
sight. I should've taken a second look.

659
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,480
No. Actually, it was my fault
as much as his.

660
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,840
I notice you still wear a wedding ring.
Any reason for that?

661
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,920
Well... I don't know. I guess
I'm just not ready to take it off.

662
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,320
It's good. It keeps me
from being asked out on dates.

663
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,080
You must have had a terrible marriage
if you don't want any dates.

664
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,480
Well, no... I mean, he was great.
He was very brilliant. He's an architect.

665
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,560
Real handsome and everything.

666
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,160
But if you're gonna have an affair, not
with my best friend in my four-poster bed.

667
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,360
And they didn't have to finish
all my pistachio nuts.

668
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,440
That inconsiderate?

669
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,080
I hope it hasn't soured you
on marriage or men.

670
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,360
- I can hear myself sounding like a bore.
- Just the opposite. Hello.

671
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,840
Yeah, she's here. How'd you know?

672
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,600
Hold on one second.

673
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,680
It's Lester.

674
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,240
Hello.

675
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,240
Yeah?

676
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
Sure, if you want me to.

677
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,360
OK. At the office? At what time?

678
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,560
- Nine?
- Nine o'clock? The building'll be dark.

679
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,400
The floor's dark. There's nobody
at the office. The office is closed.

680
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,720
You'll be in a dark room with Lester.

681
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,280
Yeah, the office is
kind of spooky at nine o'clock.

682
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,440
- Definitely.
- Sure. The hotel's even nearer.

683
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,400
- Don't go to the hotel.
- What was that?

684
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,480
OK. Room 1911. Sure.

685
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,760
OK, I'll see you there. OK.

686
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,200
You're not gonna go to the hotel with him.
It's crazy. I'd better go with you.

687
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,880
- Come on. Don't be ridiculous.
- He won't keep his hands off you.

688
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,040
He'll get you in a room, read you your
Miranda rights and tear your clothes off.

689
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,880
- He wants to produce something of mine.
- Your first child.

690
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,480
I've never been seduced by a guy
who wears loafers and no socks.

691
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,560
- Much less one who says "nucular".
- He also says "foilage".

692
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,000
- I don't like this.
- Why have you got Singin' in the Rain?

693
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,080
It's the one print that I own.

694
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,360
It's a very good 16mm print. I play it every
couple of months to get my spirits up.

695
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,520
You know, I saw it I don't know how many
years ago. I remember loving it.

696
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,800
They play it on television frequently.

697
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,400
You wanna watch it? I could
play it on this thing reel by reel.

698
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,080
- Wanna have dinner?
- Don't you have anything to do?

699
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,920
No, no. And, you know,
you got till nine o'clock.

700
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Why not? There's an Indian restaurant
right near. I'll send out. We could...

701
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,600
# All I do is dream of you
the whole night through

702
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,920
# With the dawn, I still go on
dreaming of you

703
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,320
I love this Indian food.

704
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,160
It's great.
Want some more tandoori mouse?

705
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,960
Just kidding.

706
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,400
- You want some of the curry?
- Too hot, too hot.

707
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,040
My teeth are melting.

708
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,240
Boy, this is the perfect way
to see this movie.

709
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,800
It's great, isn't it?

710
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,080
When you see Lester later, be careful.

711
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,000
This guy tells you
he wants to exchange ideas

712
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,880
when what he wants is to exchange fluids.

713
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,040
- Yes?
- I have a delivery of some flowers.

714
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,000
So Chris and you
can't agree on your honeymoon.

715
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,880
We can agree. We've talked about a lot
of different places. It's just that...

716
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,320
I told Chris, and I told you before,
I want to go someplace warm.

717
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,200
But I also wanna do things like hike...

718
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,680
- You know, I hadn't thought of Australia.
- Not Australia.

719
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,760
I should've done what my friends told me.
Just go where we first wanted to go.

720
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,920
- Where did you first wanna go?
- We wanted to go to Italy.

721
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,960
Dad, it's Jack. He's on the phone.

722
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,720
- Who?
- Jack.

723
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,400
Well, go to Venice, Florence, Rome,
and do what you want to.

724
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,480
We can have sun, we can have snow,
we can have everything we want.

725
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:39,000
- All my friends have gone to Italy.
- You won't go there cos your friends did?

726
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,280
I just wanted you to know
everything came out fine.

727
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,440
It's over and done with,
so you can forget about it.

728
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,880
Oh, my God.

729
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,600
Oh, my God.

730
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,960
I'm in shock, Jack.

731
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,960
Judah, I'm telling you,
it's like the whole thing never existed.

732
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,040
It's a small burglary. Nothing more.

733
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,120
Yeah. So go on back to your life
and... put it behind you.

734
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,520
I can't speak.

735
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,160
I need a drink.

736
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,440
What am I gonna do?
I've got guests here now.

737
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,960
Jack... God have mercy on us, Jack.

738
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,960
Mom, you told me that Mary
has been having acupuncture.

739
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,560
- She's tried it.
- Yeah, for a few months.

740
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,600
She hasn't gone back. She stopped.

741
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,840
Is everything OK, sweetheart?
You look kind of upset.

742
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,360
I'm fine. It's just Jack.

743
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,240
She still wears a collar when she drives.
She can't look around.

744
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:31,040
- But it's done a lot. I'd consider trying it.
- What about Oriental medicine?

745
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,560
I have a friend who consulted
a Chinese physician with an eye problem.

746
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,480
And he inserted a cat's whisker
into her tear duct.

747
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,560
She's been tellin' this story all week long.

748
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,640
- Well, it cured her.
- It did?

749
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,600
But you told me also he uses wires, too.

750
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,120
In acupuncture, you use needles.

751
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,600
- But very fine.
- That's a different procedure.

752
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,680
What do you think, Judah?

753
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,760
Judah?

754
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,880
Judah, what do you think?

755
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,960
I think I've done

756
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,440
a terrible thing.

757
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,520
What's wrong, honey?

758
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,040
I...

759
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:15,120
I left these papers at the office
which I absolutely need tonight.

760
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,400
I can't believe I did this. How negligent
of me. I've never done this before.

761
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,920
- I've got a major conference tomorrow...
- No, darling, you can't get them tonight.

762
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,560
I have to because
I've got an hour's work to do.

763
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,640
- But we're in the middle of a dinner party.
- I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

764
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,560
- Don't apologise.
- I don't like him driving at night.

765
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,880
Stanley, I'm so sorry about this,
but I have to get these papers.

766
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,440
- Would you like some company?
- No, not at all.

767
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,160
- Darling, forgive me.
- Chris will take you.

768
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,280
It was a wonderful evening,
and if you're here when I get back...

769
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,640
- Thank you.
- Don't worry. We're fine.

770
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:58,000
I do apologise. Let's just finish the coffee,
sit down and... he'll be back.

771
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I'll say it once again:

772
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,840
The eyes of God see all.

773
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,880
Listen to me, Judah. There is
absolutely nothing that escapes his sight.

774
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:17,040
He sees the righteous
and he sees the wicked.

775
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,480
And the righteous will be rewarded,

776
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,120
but the wicked will be punished

777
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,200
for eternity.

778
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,680
Hello?

779
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Hello?

780
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,600
Hello. Hello?

781
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:27,480
I want your opinion. I'm doing a special
on jazz. I'd like to know what you think.

782
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,480
I admire her opinion so. Did you tell him
I wanna produce your idea for a series?

783
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,120
- No.
- It's great.

784
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,760
She wants to do a different Chekhov story
every month. He wrote a million of 'em.

785
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,640
- That's very sweet of you.
- I'm putty in your hands.

786
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,160
- What'll I do with a handful of putty?
- She's always got a zinger.

787
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,240
This vixen, this minx.

788
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,760
We should be going cos we have to pick
up those airsick bags we talked about.

789
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,600
I've got to get up at dawn

790
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,960
and teach Emily Dickinson to
upper-middle-class crack addicts.

791
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,640
- One of my favourite poets.
- Me, too.

792
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,200
- Because I could not stop for Death...
- He kindly stopped for me.

793
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,280
The word "kindly", right?

794
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:08,160
The carriage held but just ourselves
And lmmortality.

795
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,240
We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
And I had put away

796
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,200
My labour, and my leisure too,
For his civility.

797
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,680
- Lester was a great English student.
- Not that I graduated.

798
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,840
It's amazing. I couldn't graduate, and
the same school now teaches a course

799
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,520
in existential motifs
in my situation comedies.

800
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,440
- Really?
- Where'd you go to college, Halley?

801
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,680
- Columbia.
- You went to Columbia?

802
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,120
- What'd you major in?
- Law. I graduated from the law school.

803
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,440
- You didn't practise?
- Yes, I did. But then, you know,

804
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,200
I met my husband and...
we moved to Europe for a while.

805
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,440
It's a long, boring story.

806
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,840
I wish you'd go back to your old job.

807
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,920
I used to edit newsreel footage so...

808
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,720
You know, floods and fires
and famines. It's depressing.

809
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,960
- We don't all have to go, you know.
- No, I do.

810
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,360
We'll go. You two stay.
You have business to talk over, right?

811
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,160
- I could go with you, if you like.
- Let's just go, OK?

812
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,440
- Let's go someplace quiet for a drink.
- I wouldn't mind that.

813
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,800
- I'm just exhausted.
- From what? It's early.

814
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,960
- Some other time.
- One little drink.

815
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,440
Really. Some other time.

816
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,160
Jesus. Lester was so pushy tonight.

817
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,520
He comes on with Halley like
it's business, but he's after her.

818
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,280
Oh, please. She really likes him. I can tell.

819
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,840
- You've gotta be kidding. She likes him?
- What's not to like?

820
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,560
- He's attractive, he's rich, he's charming.
- He's your brother. You're prejudiced.

821
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,200
She put him down pretty good
when he said "Let's go have a drink."

822
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,120
I loved the way she said
"Some other time."

823
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,040
- Fine. Enough already.
- That was pretty witty.

824
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,760
- What makes you think she likes him?
- Didn't you see her staring at him?

825
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,160
She probably can't believe her eyes.

826
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,920
You wouldn't pick up on it
if it hit you over the head.

827
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,640
You're not at all romantic.
That's the problem.

828
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,720
Hey, honey, you're the one
who stopped sleeping with me.

829
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:01,120
It'll be a year on April 20. I remember the
date exactly, cos it was Hitler's birthday.

830
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,440
I'm not discussing that any more.
I don't wanna talk about it.

831
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,680
I'll bet she's having a drink with him now.

832
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,800
For how much?
I'm serious. For how much?

833
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,280
You really know how to get my goat!

834
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,640
Hi. It's Clifford.

835
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,720
Yes, I knew you'd be in.

836
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,520
I just... You know.
Tonight was a lot of fun.

837
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,600
Wasn't Lester... so silly?

838
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:49,400
I mean, the guy is so self-important.
He was pushing all night.

839
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,880
I was frankly embarrassed for him.

840
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,840
What is he doing there?

841
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,960
You're talkin' business at 12 midnight?

842
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,160
Well... Gee, that could be very dangerous.

843
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,640
You want me...
You want me to come over?

844
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,720
OK. If you can handle it.

845
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,800
OK. I'll see you tomorrow.

846
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,120
I'm completely in love with Halley,
and Lester is startin' to make his move.

847
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,720
He wants her just
for a conquest. I can tell.

848
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,560
You know, it's so shallow,
and I'm crazy about her.

849
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,120
How can I compete with the guy?
He's rich and famous and successful.

850
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:46,520
- Come on. He's no competition for you.
- God bless you for saying that.

851
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:51,120
But you'll find, as you go through life, that
great depth and smouldering sensuality

852
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,640
does not always win, I'm sorry to say.

853
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:57,280
Meanwhile, his brother Ben, the rabbi,
he's a wonderful guy.

854
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,480
He called me last night. He's going blind.

855
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:03,960
He's got a terrible eye disease.
He's gonna be blind in a few months.

856
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:07,080
And he's got a great attitude.
He's really a mensch.

857
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,280
All right. Look left.

858
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,040
Now straight ahead, Ben.

859
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,120
Now to the right.

860
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,200
That's good.

861
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:31,480
My mother said that
I should go to the doctor,

862
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,080
because I was... My eyes weren't so good.

863
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,240
Well, you're an ophthalmologist.

864
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,960
Do you agree the eyes
are the windows of the soul?

865
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:44,160
Well, I believe they're windows,
but I'm not sure it's a soul I see.

866
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,680
My mother taught me I have a soul,

867
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,960
and it'll live on after me when I'm gone,

868
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:53,840
and if you look deeply enough
in my eyes, you can see it.

869
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,920
So what's the verdict?

870
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,960
Cos I'd like to get this resolved
before my daughter's wedding.

871
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,680
- Julie's getting married?
- Time passes quickly, doesn't it?

872
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,960
Remember she was just a baby?
Well, yours, too.

873
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,440
- Yes.
- Are you OK, Judah?

874
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,520
- Yeah.
- You don't look so good.

875
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:23,120
I'm fine.
I just haven't been sleeping that well.

876
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:28,480
Tell me... if I'm not prying... did you ever
resolve your personal difficulties?

877
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,360
Yes, actually.

878
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,400
It resolved itself.
The woman listened to reason.

879
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,360
Did she?

880
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:39,360
That's wonderful. So you got a break.

881
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,720
Sometimes to have a little good luck
is the most brilliant plan.

882
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,960
Judah, relax. You're white.
You're gonna have a breakdown. It's over.

883
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,440
What do you expect me to be?
My old self?

884
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,760
I jump when the phone rings.

885
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:56,880
- No good can come of this, Jack.
- Don't be so guilty. I kept you uninvolved.

886
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,320
The guy who's responsible is gone.
He's back in New Orleans.

887
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,760
It's pure evil, Jack.

888
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:06,560
A man kills for money.
He doesn't even know his victims.

889
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:10,200
He kills, you pay him
and then he... he kills again.

890
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,720
What was your alternative?

891
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,200
How did I get in so deep? I...

892
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,040
What dream was I following?

893
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:23,560
Judah, you said it yourself a million
times. You only go around once.

894
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,320
Jack, I went to her place after.

895
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,880
I had to retrieve
some incriminating things.

896
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,200
I saw her there... just staring up.

897
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,280
An inert object.

898
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:41,720
There was nothing behind her eyes
if you looked into them.

899
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,400
All you saw was a

900
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,480
black void.

901
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,480
Can I help you?

902
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,720
I used to live in this house once.

903
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,800
Really? When?

904
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,680
Many years ago.

905
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,440
My brother and I
used to race through these rooms.

906
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,880
He was a wonderful kid, my brother.
We were very close in those days.

907
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:50,560
My father had high hopes for him,
but it never seemed to... work out for him.

908
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,200
Would you mind if I just take a minute?

909
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,440
Everything seems to be
flooding through me.

910
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,520
Sure.

911
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,200
Come on, Sol. Get on with it. I'm hungry.

912
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,280
- Do you mind, May?
- It's nonsense anyway.

913
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:30,520
Why put us through this mumbo jumbo?
Bring on the main course.

914
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,200
I apologise for my disrespectful sister.

915
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,600
This is the twentieth century.
You have young boys sitting here.

916
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:41,040
- Don't fill their heads with superstition.
- The intellectual. The schoolteacher.

917
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,760
Spare us your Leninist philosophy
just this once.

918
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,560
Afraid if you don't obey the rules
God'll punish you?

919
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,840
- Not me, May. He punishes the wicked.
- Who? Like Hitler?

920
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,720
- We're having a Seder!
- Six million Jews burned to death

921
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,720
- and they got away with it.
- How did they get away with it?

922
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,320
Come on, Sol, open your eyes!
Six million Jews and millions of others.

923
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,000
- And they got off.
- How could humans do such a thing?

924
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,080
Because might makes right.

925
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,480
- Until the Americans marched in...
- I don't like this talk at my Seder.

926
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,680
OK, OK! All right!

927
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,760
I think this is interesting.

928
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,560
You know, there's this joke about
the prizefighter who enters the ring.

929
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:21,040
And his brother says to the family priest
"Father, pray for him."

930
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,960
The priest said "I will.
But if he can punch, it'll help."

931
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:28,440
What are you saying, May? You challenge
the whole moral structure of everything?

932
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,560
What moral structure? Is that the kind
of nonsense you use on your pupils?

933
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,000
Do you not find human impulses
basically decent?

934
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,800
- There's basically nothing.
- Such a cynic, my sister. A nihilist.

935
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,160
- Back to Russia!
- Well... Listen.

936
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:46,120
I happen to agree with May
when it comes to all that mumbo jumbo.

937
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:50,280
How can you say that? You come
to every Seder. You pray in Hebrew.

938
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:54,240
Yes. I'm going through the motions.
It's like any ritual. It's a habit.

939
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:58,160
What are you saying, May? There's
no morality anywhere in the whole world?

940
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,960
For those who want morality,
there's morality.

941
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,880
- Nothing's handed down in stone.
- Sol's kind of faith is a gift.

942
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,960
It's like an ear for music,
or the talent to draw.

943
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,320
He believes. You can use logic
on him and he still believes.

944
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,200
Must everything be logical?

945
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,840
And if a man commits a crime,

946
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,120
if he... if he kills...

947
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:23,760
- One way or another he will be punished.
- If he's caught, Sol.

948
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:28,440
If he's not, that which originates from a
black deed will blossom in a foul manner.

949
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,560
- You're relying too heavily on the Bible.
- No, no, no.

950
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:35,680
Whether it's the Old Testament
or Shakespeare, murder will out.

951
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:39,640
- Who said anything about murder?
- You did.

952
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,920
Did I?

953
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,840
And I say,
if he can do it and get away with it

954
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,640
and he chooses
not to be bothered by the ethics,

955
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,120
then he's home free.

956
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,160
Remember,
history is written by the winners.

957
01:09:55,240 --> 01:10:00,520
If the Nazis had won, future generations
would see World War II quite differently.

958
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,760
Your aunt is a brilliant woman, Judah,
but she's had a very unhappy life.

959
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,440
And if all your faith is wrong, Sol?

960
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,040
Just what if, huh? If?

961
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,120
I'll still have a better life
than all of those that doubt.

962
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:17,240
Wait a minute. Are you telling me
that you prefer God to the truth?

963
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,160
If necessary,
I will always choose God over truth.

964
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,600
I agree with him.

965
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,440
I say what goes around comes around.

966
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,640
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

967
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,560
- I was worried. It's late.
- I had some business.

968
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,080
- Mrs Ames is waiting.
- Any messages?

969
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:40,000
Yeah. An odd one.
A Detective O'Donnell called.

970
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,200
He wanted to talk to you about something.

971
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:46,840
I tried to get him to tell me what,
but he said he only wants to talk with you.

972
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,520
# He says "Murder", he says

973
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,040
# Every time we kiss,
he says "Murder", he says

974
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,720
# Keep it up like this
and then "Murder", he says

975
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,080
# In that impossible tone

976
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:04,320
# Will bring on
nobody's murder but his own

977
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,080
That was not such a great movie,
but it was fun.

978
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:11,600
Yeah, I liked it. I think maybe
when I'm older, I wanna be an actress.

979
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:16,040
Don't be an actress. I want you to be
on the Supreme Court, or a doctor.

980
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,680
You know, show business is dog-eat-dog.

981
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:23,520
It's worse than dog-eat-dog. It's dog
doesn't return other dog's phone calls.

982
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,920
Which reminds me,
I should check my service.

983
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,600
Though I haven't had a message
in seven years.

984
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,880
I call up and I hear the girls giggling.

985
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,000
- How's Halley?
- She's great.

986
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,080
I'm gonna make my move there, I think.

987
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:39,440
But I have this ethical dilemma cos I'm
married. You shouldn't know about that.

988
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,400
Clifford Stern. Any messages?
Can you check, please?

989
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,760
My heart says one thing.
My head says another.

990
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,800
Very hard to get your heart and head
together in life. Let me teach you that.

991
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,520
Mine aren't even friendly.

992
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,600
Yes.

993
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,640
Really?

994
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,240
No.

995
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,240
OK, thank you.

996
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,120
What's wrong?

997
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,480
Professor Levy

998
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,960
committed suicide.

999
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,520
But we must always remember

1000
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,560
that we, when we are born,

1001
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:33,400
we need a great deal of love
in order to persuade us to stay in life.

1002
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,640
Once we get that love

1003
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,280
it usually lasts us.

1004
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,920
But the universe is a pretty cold place.

1005
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,040
It's we who invest it with our feelings.

1006
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:46,360
And, under certain conditions,

1007
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,960
we feel that the thing
isn't worth it any more.

1008
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:54,240
I came as soon as I heard.
I thought you might not wanna be alone.

1009
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,440
God, it's been terrible. You know?

1010
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,160
I called... The guy was not sick at all.

1011
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,600
And he left a note, a simple note:
"I've gone out the window."

1012
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:07,040
This is a major intellectual, and this is
his note. What the hell does that mean?

1013
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:10,360
This guy was a role model.
You'd think he'd leave a decent note.

1014
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,000
Did he have family or anything?

1015
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,280
No. They were all killed in the war.
That's what's so strange.

1016
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,360
He's seen the worst side of life.
He always was affirmative.

1017
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,680
Always said yes to life. Yes, yes.
Now today, he said no.

1018
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,160
Can you imagine his students?
How shattered they're gonna be?

1019
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,120
I don't know from suicide.
Where I grew up in Brooklyn,

1020
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,960
nobody committed suicide.
Everyone was too unhappy.

1021
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,400
Boy, this will put a damper on the show.

1022
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:38,720
I got 600,000 feet of film on this guy
and he's telling how great life is,

1023
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,800
and now what am I gonna do?

1024
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,280
I'll cut it up and make it into guitar picks.

1025
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:48,880
I was thinking. No matter how elaborate
a philosophical system you work out,

1026
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,880
in the end, it's gotta be incomplete.

1027
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,200
I've been so annoyed all day.
I'm sorry for seeming cranky.

1028
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,280
- I understand.
- This was such a blow.

1029
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,080
I just thought
you might want some company.

1030
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,000
No, don't do that.

1031
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:09,320
It's something that
I've wanted to do now for weeks.

1032
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,560
- You must know that.
- You're married.

1033
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,280
Yes, I'm married,
but that's not gonna... last.

1034
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,160
- I mean, you know...
- Well, you know, I'm... I'm not ready.

1035
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,160
Is there something you're not telling me?

1036
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,400
- No.
- Is there anybody else?

1037
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:30,280
- I just don't want you to say it's Lester.
- It's me. It's just me.

1038
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:35,000
I... I guess I haven't
gotten over my divorce yet.

1039
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,560
And also, I feel unsettled about my career.

1040
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,000
You don't know this
but I'm very ambitious,

1041
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,400
and that's an area
that I'd like to get consolidated.

1042
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,120
I just feel, you know, unsettled.

1043
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,960
- Don't confuse me.
- I'm not trying to confuse you.

1044
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,040
I don't know what I'm doing.

1045
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:10,080
I better go. I should just leave.

1046
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:13,280
- You just got here.
- I know, but I... you know.

1047
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:17,640
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- No, that's OK. It's not... I'll see you soon.

1048
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,960
I'll just... I'll be seeing you.

1049
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,640
Please come in.

1050
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:30,080
We read about it in the paper.
It's a terrible thing.

1051
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,080
She'd been coming here for years.

1052
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,160
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

1053
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,720
Just a couple of questions, Doctor.

1054
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:43,000
The record shows that she phoned you
here and at your home a number of times.

1055
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,960
She was worried about her eyes.

1056
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,760
- What was she suffering from?
- Nothing serious. She...

1057
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,960
She had light flashes
and they alarmed her.

1058
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,520
I could never find
anything very wrong with her.

1059
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,360
And I told her that
it's just a common occurrence.

1060
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,560
- She was a hypochondriac?
- No, I wouldn't say that but

1061
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,640
she was concerned.

1062
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,160
And there's nothing she ever said
that might be relevant to the case?

1063
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,240
Personal life? Friends?

1064
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,320
No. Not really.

1065
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,120
How did she come to you?

1066
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,600
You know, I honestly can't remember.

1067
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:20,600
- Possibly another patient.
- Can I get that name?

1068
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,960
Well, it was a while ago
and I... I treat so many patients.

1069
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,240
Might it be in your records?

1070
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,320
No. No, I... I doubt it very much.

1071
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,760
- Well, I'm sorry to take up your time.
- That's all right.

1072
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,160
If you remember anything,
will you give me a call?

1073
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,520
Sure.

1074
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,600
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

1075
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:52,160
Judah, you're having a breakdown.

1076
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,400
The police know she phoned me.
I lied, but they saw through it.

1077
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:59,000
- I can't take this, Jack.
- Pull yourself together or you'll blow it.

1078
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:02,200
I did it, and it's irrevocable,
and now I'm gonna pay.

1079
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:05,960
I had to fight an urge to confess
to the police. I want this off my mind.

1080
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:10,600
Listen. I'm in this with you. I helped you
out and I don't wanna go to jail for it.

1081
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:16,920
You may not care if you drag me down
with you, but I'm not letting that happen.

1082
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,800
- What the hell is that? A threat?
- Just be a man. You're in the clear.

1083
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,200
- You'll rub me out, too?
- Don't talk nonsense.

1084
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,840
What did you mean by saying
you won't let it happen?

1085
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,640
You're my brother.
You've helped me out financially.

1086
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,800
I did you a favour when you needed it.

1087
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,880
Now all of a sudden you want to confess?

1088
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,440
The time to confess was to Miriam,
about your mistress. Not about this.

1089
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:41,240
This is murder. You paid for it,
I engineered it. It's over. Forget about it.

1090
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,280
One sin leads to a deeper sin.

1091
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:49,120
- Now you sound like Papa.
- Adultery, fornication, lies, killing.

1092
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:52,440
- Shut up already.
- Or you'll have your friends shut me up?

1093
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:55,360
One phone call,
like pushing a button, right?

1094
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:35,000
Judah, I don't know what's wrong with
you these days. You're a different person.

1095
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,080
I believe in God, Miriam.

1096
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:42,720
I know it... because without God
the world is a cesspool.

1097
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,560
You're drinking steadily and every day.
You never used to. It's something new.

1098
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,040
- God, it's hot in here.
- Well, maybe we should go.

1099
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:54,320
- Don't tell me what I should do, dammit!
- Judah, will you calm down!

1100
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,520
I don't feel well. I'm gonna get a little air.

1101
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,600
No, you stay here.

1102
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,320
Look, this story on the homeless,
it's too long.

1103
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,760
I want five pages. Make sure
he gets five real pages out of it.

1104
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,360
He tells the secretary to type it tighter.
He doesn't take anything out.

1105
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,240
I want Joe Hanson off the show.

1106
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:40,720
He doesn't write funny. If he has cancer,
I'll send him flowers. I want him off.

1107
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,320
Jesus! Doesn't anybody
know how to write funny any more?

1108
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,360
Am I supposed to write it myself?
Direct it myself? Produce it myself?

1109
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:52,800
I can't believe this! Look at those people
out there! Look out the window at them.

1110
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,120
These people are lookin'
for something funny in their lives!

1111
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:00,360
You're givin' 'em straight lines!
They're waitin' for something funny!

1112
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,120
This is terrible.

1113
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,200
What are you doing to me?

1114
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,000
This is supposed to be
the profile of a creative mind.

1115
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:30,200
It's tough for a woman in this profession.
I can make it easier for you.

1116
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,240
What is this? When did you shoot that?

1117
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:36,520
I was lurking around the corner.
I couldn't resist.

1118
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:41,680
I don't wanna do it in kind of a vulgar way
and just take it off what I see here.

1119
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,920
I wanna find out what's in here,
so I gotta spend some time with you.

1120
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,520
We'll have a little dinner together, just...

1121
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,000
OK, step aside. I'm taking over this film.

1122
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:54,560
- What? You can't finish my film.
- I can't? Read your contract.

1123
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:58,000
- You promised.
- Look, the idea was to show the real me.

1124
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:02,920
I may not be perfect, but I don't promote
values that... Let me quote you exactly:

1125
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,040
"That deaden the sensibilities
of a great democracy".

1126
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:08,840
You're fired, Cliff!
You're out! Get outta here!

1127
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:11,280
Go! Thank you! Goodbye!

1128
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:15,560
If it bends, it's funny. If it breaks, it isn't.

1129
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:20,160
Come on now. Don't get discouraged.
You have your own personal vision.

1130
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:24,280
Why is he so upset? You'd think nobody
was ever compared to Mussolini before.

1131
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:29,400
I had no idea you would cut the film like
this. I'd have told you they'd never use it.

1132
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,880
They want an upbeat profile of Lester.

1133
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:35,560
Now he's gonna re-cut it
and make himself into a saint.

1134
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:39,880
Wendy's right. I'm probably jealous
of him. His limos, his money, his women.

1135
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,960
You have your own style.

1136
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:46,200
Hey, listen. Marry me. I'm serious.
That's the only thing that'll satisfy me.

1137
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:49,440
I'm crazy about you. You're single.
My marriage won't last.

1138
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,280
I gotta talk to you. Can we just...
Can we sit down here for a second?

1139
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:56,440
I'm not joking. I'm really nuts about you.

1140
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,520
I'm going away.

1141
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,560
Yeah? Meaning what?

1142
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:07,920
I've... I'm... I've got a chance
to produce a couple of shows in London

1143
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
and I couldn't say no.

1144
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,960
So how long are you going for?

1145
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,680
Well, probably three or four months.

1146
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,760
Three or four months?

1147
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,480
Jesus, you're kidding.

1148
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,560
What a discouraging thought.

1149
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:28,560
But, you know,
I think it's a good thing, because I ne...

1150
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:31,160
Well, it'll give me a little distance.

1151
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,800
About 3,000 miles, to be exact.

1152
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:37,360
- When are you leaving?
- I guess... ten days or so.

1153
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,080
God, I'm...

1154
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:49,360
God, I'm gonna miss you.
I don't know what to say. I just...

1155
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I'm not gonna see you
for three or four months?

1156
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,920
I feel like I... you know,
like I've been handed a prison sentence.

1157
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:29,960
Ben, your daughter
will make a beautiful bride.

1158
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:33,880
This is Barbara,
the sister of my brother-in-law.

1159
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:38,760
Congratulations.
I wish your daughter all the happiness.

1160
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,800
Jesus. I'm so self-conscious.

1161
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,040
Every single thing on me is rented.

1162
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:51,560
I got a rented tux,
rented shoes, rented underwear.

1163
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,880
You look terrific. Cliff, do me a favour.

1164
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,840
This is your last occasion with my family.
Could we try to get along?

1165
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,480
And this is Dr Rosenthal.

1166
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,560
I'm Miriam.

1167
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:07,200
- And this is Marion, and this is Peter.
- How do you do? A pleasure to meet you.

1168
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,520
- Judah?
- Yes, Ben.

1169
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,640
Judah, I'm so glad you could make it.
It means a lot.

1170
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:18,840
What is the matter with you?
You seem so depressed.

1171
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,680
Wendy and I finally decided
to call it quits.

1172
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:26,840
Even though the last couple of years have
been terrible, it just makes me feel sad.

1173
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,760
- I'll have a vodka and tonic.
- I'll have one, too.

1174
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:33,200
But, you know, you told me
it's been platonic for a year.

1175
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,680
And I say once the sex goes, it all goes.

1176
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:40,520
It's true. Last time I was inside a woman
was when I visited the Statue of Liberty.

1177
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:52,520
Look at your father.
He's celebrating enough for two.

1178
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:56,200
He and Ben will get high
and argue about belief and God.

1179
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,440
My father takes after his Aunt May.

1180
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:03,880
She rejected the Bible because she said
it had an unbelievable central character.

1181
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:08,240
I walked in. I said "The Waldorf-Astoria.
The centrepieces." Did you see them?

1182
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,640
- Beautiful.
- Everything matches. Lester paid for it.

1183
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:14,360
Hard to believe
a brother would pay for a wedding.

1184
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:18,520
Hard to believe, but that's the sort of thing
Lester is always doing. Isn't it?

1185
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,800
He must be a good brother.

1186
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:39,280
I'm gonna get one like that.
It's much better. This is very square.

1187
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,600
- Hi, Cliff.
- Cliff. Hello.

1188
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,320
Lester. How are you? Good to see you.

1189
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:48,720
- My fiancee, Halley Reed.
- Congratulations. My wife Nancy.

1190
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:55,040
- When'd you get back?
- Got back this morning.

1191
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:58,880
- I've been trying to call you all day.
- I finally won her heart.

1192
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,600
What a romantic story.
We ran into each other in London

1193
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:07,520
and I sent her white roses
around the clock, all the time, for days.

1194
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,200
For days. And then
I found out she was allergic.

1195
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:13,720
- Hi, Lester.
- Hi. Good to see you.

1196
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:19,080
So, I started pleading with her. I begged
her. I just... begged her day and night.

1197
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:22,000
And I think it was the caviar that did it.

1198
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,840
I tell you, I've envied this guy for years.

1199
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:29,320
He'd show up with a beautiful woman
every time. But I envy you more now.

1200
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,120
Thank you.

1201
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,800
Standing here in the presence of God,

1202
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,920
the guardian of our homes,

1203
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,440
ready to enter into the bonds of wedlock,

1204
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:07,080
answer each of you in reverence for God

1205
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:12,240
and in the hearing of the assembly that
have gathered here so joyously with you.

1206
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,840
- I know the perfect guy for you.
- Who?

1207
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:26,880
- He's brilliant. He's attractive.
- There's a hitch. I'm waiting.

1208
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:30,720
There's a hitch, but it sounds
worse than it is. He's in prison.

1209
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,800
- Rita, I would say that's a drawback.
- Nothing terrible. Insider trading.

1210
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:38,160
He made a fortune in the market.
And he'll be out soon.

1211
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,600
Very soon. A couple of years.

1212
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,680
You mean with good behaviour.

1213
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,760
Cliff?

1214
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,760
I wanted to talk to you.

1215
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,320
What is there really to say?
You know, I'm just stunned still.

1216
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,200
He's not what you think.

1217
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:23,080
He's wonderful. He's...
He's warm and caring and...

1218
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,800
- romantic...
- He's a success. That's what he is.

1219
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,240
- He's rich and he's a success.
- Give me a little credit.

1220
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:33,880
I always did give you
a little credit, until today.

1221
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:38,920
We used to laugh at this guy. The silly
shows he puts on, the way he talks.

1222
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
He's endearing.

1223
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,840
This is my worst fear realised.

1224
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,600
I wanted to give you this letter back.

1225
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:59,440
- It's my one love letter.
- It's beautiful.

1226
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,920
I'm just... the wrong person.

1227
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,880
It's probably just as well.

1228
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,320
I plagiarised most of it from James Joyce.

1229
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:16,920
You probably wondered
why all the references to Dublin.

1230
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,800
Look, I...

1231
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:21,800
I hope we can always be friends.

1232
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,920
Off by yourself, huh? You're like me.

1233
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:12,240
I always get sad at these kind of events.

1234
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,320
You look very deep in thought.

1235
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,400
I was plotting the perfect murder.

1236
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,560
Yeah? Movie plot?

1237
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,320
Movie?

1238
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,760
Ben... That's what Ben told me.
He says you make films.

1239
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,760
Yeah, but not that kind... You know.

1240
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,840
A different kind.

1241
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,200
I have a great murder story.

1242
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,800
- Yes?
- Great plot.

1243
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,080
Yeah.

1244
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:49,880
Hey, I've had too many to drink.
I mean, forgive me.

1245
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,960
I know you want your privacy.

1246
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:55,680
No, it's OK. You know.
I'm not doing anything special.

1247
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:59,680
Except my murder story has

1248
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,760
a very strange twist.

1249
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,680
Yeah?

1250
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:10,680
Let's say there's this man
who's very successful.

1251
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:13,040
He has everything.

1252
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,560
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

1253
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,160
Am I a phoney?

1254
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,560
- What?
- Am I a phoney?

1255
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:28,760
- Are you a little high or something?
- No, I'm... I think he hates me.

1256
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,920
- Who hates you?
- Your annoying husband.

1257
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,240
Every time I'm with him, I get tense.

1258
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,920
- It's just that he's angry.
- At what?

1259
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,440
Are you kidding me? He's got these
fantasies about changing the world.

1260
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,920
He makes these films
and they come to nothing.

1261
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:47,520
Listen, honey. He's gotta grow up.
This is the real world. This is the big time.

1262
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,840
They don't pay off on high aspirations.
You gotta deliver.

1263
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:56,640
Not to mention... You're still young.
You're not gettin' the life that you deserve.

1264
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,720
Lester, I met somebody.

1265
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,360
That...

1266
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:04,240
That is music to my ears.

1267
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,480
And after the awful deed is done,

1268
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:11,880
he finds that he's plagued
by deep-rooted guilt.

1269
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:17,080
Little sparks of his religious background,
which he'd rejected,

1270
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:19,160
are suddenly stirred up.

1271
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,680
He... hears his father's voice.

1272
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:26,760
He... imagines that God
is watching his every move.

1273
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:32,920
Suddenly it's not an empty universe at all,
but a just and moral one, and...

1274
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,800
he's violated it.

1275
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:38,760
Now he's panic-stricken.

1276
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:41,520
He's on the verge of a mental collapse.

1277
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:45,600
An inch away from confessing
the whole thing to the police.

1278
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:52,200
And then, one morning, he awakens and

1279
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:55,920
the sun is shining and
his family is around him and

1280
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,520
mysteriously the crisis has lifted.

1281
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:06,120
He takes his family on a vacation to
Europe and as the months pass he finds

1282
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,200
he's not punished.

1283
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,280
In fact, he prospers.

1284
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:15,200
The killing gets attributed to a drifter who
has several other murders to his credit

1285
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:18,400
so, what the hell,
one more doesn't even matter.

1286
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,960
Now he's scot-free.

1287
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:24,640
His life is completely back to normal.

1288
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:29,480
Back to his protected world
of wealth and privilege.

1289
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:33,480
Yes, but can he ever really go back?

1290
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:39,640
Well... People carry sins
around with them.

1291
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:43,680
Maybe once in a while
he has a bad moment, but it passes.

1292
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,840
And, with time, it all fades.

1293
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:53,320
Yeah, but... so then, you know,
his worst beliefs are realised.

1294
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:57,080
Well, I said it was a chilling story, didn't I?

1295
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:02,520
I don't know. It'd be tough
for somebody to live with that.

1296
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:06,840
Very few guys could actually
live with that on their conscience.

1297
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:09,280
People carry awful deeds
around with them.

1298
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:12,680
What do you expect him to do?
Turn himself in?

1299
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,760
I mean, this is reality.

1300
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:19,600
In reality, we rationalise, we deny,
or we couldn't go on living.

1301
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,720
Here's what I would do.
I would have him turn himself in.

1302
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:30,280
Cos then, you see, your story
assumes tragic proportions

1303
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,720
because, in the absence of a God,

1304
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,760
he is forced to assume
that responsibility himself.

1305
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,840
Then you have tragedy.

1306
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,120
But that's fiction. That's movies.

1307
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,200
You see too many movies.
I'm talkin' about reality.

1308
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:50,080
I mean, if you want a happy ending,
you should go see a Hollywood movie.

1309
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:55,040
Come on, darling.
Let's think about going home, huh?

1310
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,240
Nice talkin' to you. Good luck.

1311
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:01,880
Miriam, we're gonna make a wedding
like this for Sharon. And I can't wait.

1312
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,960
She'll be radiant.

1313
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:08,480
- You're looking very handsome tonight.
- And you look beautiful.

1314
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:37,080
We are all faced throughout
our lives with agonising decisions.

1315
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:39,160
Moral choices.

1316
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:42,120
Some are on a grand scale.

1317
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:45,640
Most of these choices
are on lesser points.

1318
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:51,520
But we define ourselves
by the choices we have made.

1319
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:56,520
We are, in fact,
the sum total of our choices.

1320
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:00,560
Events unfold so unpredictably,

1321
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:03,160
so unfairly.

1322
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:07,280
Human happiness does not
seem to have been included

1323
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,760
in the design of creation.

1324
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:14,320
It is only we, with our capacity to love,

1325
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:18,120
that give meaning
to the indifferent universe.

1326
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:25,200
And yet, most human beings seem
to have the ability to keep trying,

1327
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,840
and even to find joy,

1328
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,920
from simple things,

1329
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,440
like their family,

1330
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,400
their work,

1331
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:41,480
and from the hope that future
generations might understand more.
