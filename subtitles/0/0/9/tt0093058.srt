1
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:39,520
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
your senior drill instructor.

2
00:01:39,698 --> 00:01:42,759
From now on,
you will speak only when spoken to...

3
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,531
...and the first and last words
out of your filthy sewers will be ""sir.""

4
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,571
Do you maggots understand that?.

5
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:49,969
Sir, yes, sir.

6
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:53,443
Bullshit. I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.

7
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,979
Sir, yes, sir.

8
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:59,506
If you ladies leave my island,
if you survive recruit training...

9
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,019
...you will be a weapon.

10
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:04,215
You will be a minister of death
praying for war.

11
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:07,190
But until that day, you are pukes.

12
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:09,729
You are the lowest form of life on Earth.

13
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,265
You are not even human-fucking-beings.

14
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:17,327
You are nothing but unorganized,
grabasstic pieces of amphibian shit.

15
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,374
Because I am hard, you will not like me.

16
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,240
But the more you hate me,
the more you will learn.

17
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:25,506
I am hard but I am fair.

18
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:27,946
There is no racial bigotry here.

19
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:32,249
I do not look down on niggers,
kikes, wops or greasers.

20
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:34,914
Here, you are all equally worthless.

21
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:38,052
And my orders are to weed out
all non-hackers...

22
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,063
...who do not pack the gear
to serve in my beloved Corps.

23
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,224
Do you maggots understand that?.

24
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:44,630
Sir, yes, sir.

25
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:46,532
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

26
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:48,697
Sir, yes, sir!

27
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:52,140
-What's your name, scumbag?.
-Sir, Private Brown, sir!

28
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,868
Bullshit. From now on
you're Private Snowball.

29
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:57,381
-Do you like that name?.
-Sir, yes, sir!

30
00:02:57,551 --> 00:03:00,247
Well, there's one thing
that you won't like, Snowball:

31
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:02,582
They don't serve fried chicken
and watermelon...

32
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:04,850
...on a daily basis in my mess hall.

33
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:06,517
Sir, yes, sir!

34
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:10,257
Is that you, John Wayne?. Is this me?.

35
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:12,127
Who said that?.

36
00:03:12,301 --> 00:03:14,257
Who the fuck said that?.

37
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:17,895
Who's the slimy little communist-shit,
twinkle-toed cocksucker down here...

38
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:20,702
...who just signed
his own death warrant?.

39
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:23,069
Nobody, huh?.

40
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:26,944
The fairy-fucking-godmother said it.
Out-fucking-standing.

41
00:03:27,117 --> 00:03:29,711
I will P.T. you all until you fucking die.

42
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:32,651
I'll P.T. you until your assholes
are sucking buttermilk.

43
00:03:32,823 --> 00:03:35,679
-Was it you, you scroungy little fuck?.
-Sir, no, sir.

44
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,057
You piece of shit. You look
like a fucking worm. I'll bet it was you.

45
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,586
-Sir, no, sir.
-Sir, I said it, sir.

46
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:46,459
Well, no shit.

47
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,972
What have we got here?.
A fucking comedian. Private Joker.

48
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:52,030
I admire your honesty.

49
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:55,670
Hell, I like you. You can come over
to my house and fuck my sister.

50
00:03:57,317 --> 00:04:01,549
You little scumbag.
I've got your name. I've got your ass.

51
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:03,748
You will not laugh. You will not cry.

52
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:06,155
You will learn by the numbers.
I will teach you.

53
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:08,892
Now get up. Get on your feet.

54
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:13,797
You best unfuck yourself or I will unscrew
your head and shit down your neck.

55
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:17,325
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Private Joker, why did you join my Corps?.

56
00:04:17,506 --> 00:04:19,565
-Sir, to kill, sir.
-So you're a killer?.

57
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:22,598
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Let me see your war face.

58
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:25,168
-Sir?.
-You've got a war face?.

59
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:30,180
That's a war face.
Now let me see your war face.

60
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:34,882
Bullshit. You didn't convince me.
Let me see your real war face.

61
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,649
You don't scare me. Work on it.

62
00:04:37,828 --> 00:04:39,420
Sir, yes, sir!

63
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:40,859
What's your eXcuse?.

64
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,397
Sir, eXcuse for what, sir?.

65
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:45,400
I'm asking the fucking questions, private.
Do you understand?.

66
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,595
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Well, thank you very much.

67
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:50,333
-Can I be in charge for a while?.
-Sir, yes, sir.

68
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:53,638
-Are you shook-up?. Are you nervous?.
-Sir, I am, sir.

69
00:04:53,813 --> 00:04:55,872
-Do I make you nervous?.
-Sir....

70
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:58,744
Sir what?.
Were you about to call me an asshole?.

71
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:01,251
-Sir, no, sir.
-How tall are you, private?.

72
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:02,912
Sir, 5'9"", sir.

73
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:05,854
Five-foot-9. I didn't know
they stacked shit that high.

74
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:08,324
You trying to squeeze an inch
in on me somewhere?.

75
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:11,488
-Sir, no, sir.
-Bullshit. It looks like the best part of you...

76
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:15,397
...ran down the crack of your mama's ass
and ended up as a stain on the mattress.

77
00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:16,900
I think you've been cheated.

78
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:19,169
Where the hell are you from, private?.

79
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:21,832
-Sir, TeXas, sir.
-Holy dogshit. TeXas?.

80
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:25,071
Only steers and queers
come from TeXas, Private Cowboy.

81
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:28,739
And you don't much look like a steer to me,
so that kind of narrows it down.

82
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,910
-Do you suck dicks?.
-Sir, no, sir.

83
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:33,385
-Are you a peter puffer?.
-Sir, no, sir.

84
00:05:33,557 --> 00:05:35,980
I'll bet you would fuck
a person in the ass...

85
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:39,789
...and not even have the goddamn common
courtesy to give him a reach around.

86
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,057
I'll be watching you.

87
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:45,827
Did your parents have any children
that lived?.

88
00:05:46,003 --> 00:05:48,234
-Sir, yes, sir.
-I'll bet they regret that.

89
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:51,331
You're so ugly you could be
a modern-art masterpiece.

90
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,104
-What's your name, fat-body?.
-Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir.

91
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,974
Lawrence?. Lawrence what, of Arabia?.

92
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,778
-Sir, no, sir.
-That name sounds like royalty. You royalty?.

93
00:05:59,953 --> 00:06:01,909
-Sir, no, sir.
-Do you suck dicks?.

94
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:05,012
-Sir, no, sir.
-Bullshit. I'll bet you could suck a golf ball...

95
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:07,148
-...through a garden hose.
-Sir, no, sir.

96
00:06:07,328 --> 00:06:08,761
I don't like the name Lawrence.

97
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:11,056
Only faggots and sailors
are called Lawrence.

98
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:13,860
-From now on you're Gomer Pyle.
-Sir, yes, sir.

99
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:16,697
Do you think I'm cute, Private Pyle?.
You think I'm funny?.

100
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:19,966
-Sir, no, sir.
-Wipe that disgusting grin off your face.

101
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:22,029
Sir, yes, sir.

102
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,337
Well, any-fucking-time, sweetheart.

103
00:06:24,813 --> 00:06:28,204
-Sir, I'm trying, sir.
-Private Pyle, I'll give you three seconds...

104
00:06:28,384 --> 00:06:30,477
...eXactly three fucking seconds...

105
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:33,213
...to wipe that stupid-looking grin
off your face...

106
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:37,383
...or I will gouge out your eyeballs
and skull-fuck you.

107
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:40,086
One. Two. Three.

108
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:44,895
-Sir, I can't help it, sir.
-Bullshit. Get on your knees, scumbag.

109
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:48,601
Now choke yourself.

110
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:52,833
Goddamn it, with my hand, numb-nuts.

111
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:57,040
Don't pull my fucking hand over there.
I said, choke yourself.

112
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,049
Now lean forward and choke yourself.

113
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:06,049
-Are you through grinning?.
-Sir, yes, sir.

114
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,784
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

115
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,159
Sir, yes, sir.

116
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,153
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.
Sound off like you've got a pair.

117
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,132
Sir, yes, sir.

118
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:19,193
That's enough. Get on your feet.

119
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:26,773
Pyle, you had best square your ass away
and start shitting me Tiffany cuff links...

120
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,543
...or I will definitely fuck you up.

121
00:07:29,718 --> 00:07:31,674
Sir, yes, sir.

122
00:07:32,855 --> 00:07:36,279
Left, right, left, right
left, right, left.

123
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,791
Left, right, left, right, left.

124
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:40,589
Left, right, left, right, left....

125
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:43,392
Parris Island, South Carolina...

126
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:46,798
...the United States Marine Corps
Recruit Depot.

127
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:50,600
An eight-week college
for the phony-tough and the crazy-brave.

128
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:53,608
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

129
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:56,542
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

130
00:07:56,715 --> 00:07:59,548
Mama rolled over
And this is what she said

131
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:02,085
Mama rolled over, this is what she said

132
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:05,178
-Oh, give me some, give me some
-Oh, give me some, give me some

133
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:06,655
-P. T.
-P. T.

134
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:08,157
-P. T.
-P. T.

135
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:09,658
-Good for you
-Good for you

136
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:11,320
-And good for me
-And good for me

137
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:12,762
-Good
-Good

138
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:15,663
Up in the morning to the rising sun

139
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:18,327
Up in the morning to the rising sun

140
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:21,270
Gonna run all day till the running's done

141
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:24,570
Gonna run all day till the running's done

142
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:27,579
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

143
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:30,173
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

144
00:08:30,352 --> 00:08:33,241
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

145
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:36,482
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

146
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,187
Left, right, left, right, left.

147
00:08:40,363 --> 00:08:43,287
Your left shoulder.

148
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,328
Left, right, left. Port.

149
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:52,305
Left, right. Attack. Halt.

150
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:56,173
Left shoulder.

151
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:02,015
Private Pyle, what are you trying to do
to my beloved Corps?.

152
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:04,712
-Sir, I don't know, sir.
-You are dumb, Private Pyle...

153
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,156
...but do you eXpect me to believe
that you don't know left from right?.

154
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:10,693
-Sir, no, sir.
-Then you did that on purpose.

155
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:13,752
-You wanna be different.
-Sir, no, sir.

156
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:16,822
-What side was that, Private Pyle?.
-Sir, left side, sir.

157
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:20,531
-Are you sure, Private Pyle?.
-Sir, yes, sir.

158
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:24,269
-What side was that, Private Pyle?.
-Sir, right side, sir.

159
00:09:24,445 --> 00:09:26,812
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle.

160
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:28,608
Pick up your fucking cover.

161
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:30,011
Sir, yes, sir.

162
00:09:30,185 --> 00:09:33,018
Your left shoulder.

163
00:09:33,988 --> 00:09:37,254
Left, right, left. Port.

164
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:41,288
Left shoulder.

165
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:45,790
Your right shoulder.

166
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,960
Left, right, left, right.
Your left shoulder.

167
00:09:53,243 --> 00:09:55,872
Left, two, three, four.

168
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:58,572
Your right shoulder.

169
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:05,346
Tonight you pukes will sleep
with your rifles.

170
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:09,016
You will give your rifle a girl's name.

171
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:14,394
Because this is the only pussy
you people are going to get.

172
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:19,027
Your days of finger-banging
old Mary Jane Rottencrotch...

173
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:23,369
...through her purty pink panties
are over.

174
00:10:23,544 --> 00:10:25,603
You're married to this piece.

175
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,442
This weapon of iron and wood.

176
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:31,813
And you will be faithful.

177
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:34,350
Arms.

178
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,722
Prepare to mount.

179
00:10:42,698 --> 00:10:44,256
Mount.

180
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:50,630
Port.

181
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:56,707
Pray.

182
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:59,439
This is my rifle.

183
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:03,109
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

184
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,950
My rifle is my best friend.

185
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,785
It is my life.

186
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:12,249
I must master it
as I must master my life.

187
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:15,389
Without me, my rifle is useless.

188
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:18,423
Without my rifle, I am useless.

189
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:21,469
I must fire my rifle true.

190
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:25,668
I must shoot straighter than my enemy,
who is trying to kill me.

191
00:11:25,846 --> 00:11:28,804
I must shoot him before he shoots me.

192
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:30,507
I will.

193
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:33,347
Before God, I swear this creed.

194
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:37,218
My rifle and myself are defenders
of my country.

195
00:11:37,391 --> 00:11:39,656
We are the masters of our enemy.

196
00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:42,319
We are the saviors of my life.

197
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:46,696
So be it until there is no enemy,
but peace.

198
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:48,564
Amen.

199
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:50,899
Arm.

200
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:56,372
At ease.

201
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,771
Good night, ladies.

202
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,578
Good night, sir.

203
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:04,546
-Hit it, sweetheart.
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.

204
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:07,877
Right shoulder.

205
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:15,651
That is not
your daddy's shotgun, Cowboy.

206
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,034
Left shoulder.

207
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:27,703
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle.

208
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,379
Port.

209
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:38,217
Four inches from your chest, Pyle.
Four inches.

210
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:41,353
This is my rifle, this is my gun

211
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:44,020
This is for fighting, this is for fun

212
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,622
This is my rifle, this is my gun

213
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:49,191
This is for fighting, this is for fun

214
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:51,862
This is my rifle, this is my gun

215
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,464
This is for fighting, this is for fun

216
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:57,067
This is my rifle, this is my gun

217
00:12:57,247 --> 00:12:59,670
This is for fighting, this is for fun

218
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:02,215
This is my rifle, this is my gun

219
00:13:02,385 --> 00:13:05,150
This is for fighting, this is for fun

220
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:12,057
You ' re bouncing.

221
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:29,109
T en fucking seconds.

222
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:34,141
It should take you no less than 1 0
fucking seconds to negotiate this obstacle.

223
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:35,811
Quickly, move it out.

224
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:39,618
There ain't one swinging-dick private
in this platoon's gonna graduate...

225
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:44,060
...until they can get this obstacle down
to less than 1 0 fucking seconds.

226
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:09,548
NeXt two privates. Quickly.

227
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:12,491
Get over that goddamn obstacle. Move it.

228
00:14:12,663 --> 00:14:14,722
NeXt two privates. Quickly.

229
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:16,264
Hurry up. Get up there.

230
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:19,130
-Private Joker, are you a killer?.
-Sir, yes, sir.

231
00:14:19,303 --> 00:14:21,169
Let me hear your war cry.

232
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:25,071
NeXt two privates, go. Quickly.

233
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:27,371
Get your fat ass over there, Private Pyle.

234
00:14:27,546 --> 00:14:29,275
Oh, that's right, Private Pyle.

235
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:33,340
Don't make any fucking effort
to get up to the top of the fucking obstacle.

236
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,014
If God wanted you up there, he would have
miracled your ass up by now, wouldn't he?.

237
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:40,922
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Get your fat ass up there, Pyle.

238
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:43,290
-Sir, yes, sir.
-What is the matter with you?.

239
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:47,662
I'll bet if there was some pussy up there on
top of that obstacle, you could get up there.

240
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:49,531
-Couldn't you?.
-Sir, yes, sir.

241
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:53,902
Your ass looks like about 1 50 pounds
of chewed bubble gum. Do you know that?.

242
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:55,509
Sir, yes, sir.

243
00:14:57,913 --> 00:15:00,246
One for the commandant.

244
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,443
One for the Corps.

245
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,384
Get up there. Pull.

246
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,256
I guess the Corps don't get theirs.
Get up there, Pyle.

247
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:14,454
Pull. Pull, Pyle, pull.

248
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:17,156
One pull-up, Pyle. Come on, pull.

249
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:20,930
You gotta be shitting me, Pyle.
Get your ass up there.

250
00:15:21,106 --> 00:15:24,769
Do you mean to tell me that you cannot
do one single pull-up?.

251
00:15:24,943 --> 00:15:29,301
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle.
Get out of my face.

252
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:31,473
Get up there, Snowball.

253
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:34,280
Get up here, fat-boy.

254
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:37,719
Quickly. Move it up.
Move it up, Pyle. Move it up.

255
00:15:37,891 --> 00:15:42,089
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?.

256
00:15:42,262 --> 00:15:45,561
Get up here. You're too slow.
Move it. Move it.

257
00:15:45,732 --> 00:15:49,260
Private Pyle, whatever you do,
don't fall down.

258
00:15:49,437 --> 00:15:51,632
That would break my fucking heart.

259
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:55,264
Quickly. Up and over. Up and over.

260
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:58,971
Well, what in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?.

261
00:15:59,148 --> 00:16:02,879
Get up and over.
Move it, move it, move it.

262
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:05,577
Are you quitting on me?.

263
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:07,780
Well, are you?.

264
00:16:07,957 --> 00:16:12,246
Then quit, you slimy fucking
walrus-looking piece of shit.

265
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:14,919
Get the fuck off of my obstacle.

266
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,829
Get the fuck down off of my obstacle.

267
00:16:18,002 --> 00:16:20,197
Now. Move it.

268
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:25,730
I'm gonna rip your balls off so you
cannot contaminate the rest of the world.

269
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:28,539
I will motivate you, Private Pyle...

270
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:33,309
...if it short-dicks every cannibal
on the Congo.

271
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,914
Pick them up and set them down, Pyle.

272
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:39,148
Quickly. Move it out.

273
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:43,922
Were you born a fat, slimy,
scumbag puke piece of shit, Private Pyle?.

274
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:46,429
Or did you have to work on it?.

275
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,195
Move it up. Quickly. Hustle up.

276
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,933
The fucking war will be over by the time
we get out there, won't it, Private Pyle?.

277
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:56,667
Move it.

278
00:16:56,844 --> 00:17:01,008
Are you going to fucking die, Pyle?.
Are you going to die on me?.

279
00:17:01,182 --> 00:17:03,208
Do it now.

280
00:17:03,385 --> 00:17:06,843
Move it up. Hustle it up.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

281
00:17:07,923 --> 00:17:10,483
Do you feel dizzy?.

282
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:12,992
Do you feel faint?.

283
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,690
Jesus H. Christ,
I think you've got a hard-on.

284
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,330
Quickly, ladies. Assholes and elbows.
Move it out.

285
00:17:24,508 --> 00:17:26,032
Get up here.

286
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,873
Move it. Move it, move it, move it.

287
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:32,006
Quickly.

288
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:35,972
Quickly. Get up here.
Hurry up. Move it out.

289
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,236
Reveille. Reveille. Reveille.

290
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,271
Drop your cocks and grab your socks.

291
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:57,330
Today is Sunday.
Divine worship at 0800.

292
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:59,901
Get your bunks made
and get your uniforms on.

293
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:03,005
Police call will commence
in two minutes.

294
00:18:03,184 --> 00:18:04,583
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.

295
00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:06,311
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Sir, yes, sir.

296
00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:10,050
As soon as you finish your bunks,
I want you two turds to clean the head.

297
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:13,286
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.
-I want that head so sanitary...

298
00:18:13,462 --> 00:18:17,523
...that the Virgin Mary herself would be
proud to go in there and take a dump.

299
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,066
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Sir, yes, sir.

300
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:21,466
Private Joker, do you believe
in the Virgin Mary?.

301
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:23,435
Sir, no, sir.

302
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:30,307
Well, Private Joker,
I don't believe I heard you correctly.

303
00:18:30,481 --> 00:18:32,676
Sir, the private said, "" No, sir,"" sir.

304
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,013
Why, you little maggot.
You make me wanna vomit.

305
00:18:36,187 --> 00:18:40,352
You goddamn communist heathen.
Sound off that you love the Virgin Mary...

306
00:18:40,526 --> 00:18:42,721
...or I'm gonna stomp your guts out.

307
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:45,227
Now, you do love the Virgin Mary,
don't you?.

308
00:18:45,397 --> 00:18:46,659
Sir, negative, sir.

309
00:18:46,832 --> 00:18:49,324
Private Joker,
are you trying to offend me?.

310
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:50,833
Sir, negative, sir.

311
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:54,064
Sir, the private believes that
any answer he gives will be wrong...

312
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,132
...and the senior drill instructor will
beat him harder if he reverses himself, sir.

313
00:18:58,312 --> 00:18:59,870
Who's your squad leader, scumbag?.

314
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:02,880
Sir, the private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir.

315
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,938
Private Snowball.

316
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,748
Sir, Private Snowball
reporting as ordered, sir.

317
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:11,620
Private Snowball, you're fired.
Private Joker is promoted to squad leader.

318
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:14,216
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.
-Disappear, scumbag.

319
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:17,127
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.
-Private Pyle.

320
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,224
-Sir, Private Pyle reporting as ordered, sir.
-From now on...

321
00:19:20,403 --> 00:19:23,702
...Private Joker is your new squad leader
and you will bunk with him.

322
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:25,171
He'll teach you everything.

323
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:27,537
-He'll teach you how to pee.
-Sir, yes, sir.

324
00:19:27,711 --> 00:19:31,807
Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant,
but he's got guts and guts is enough.

325
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:33,711
Now, you ladies, carry on.

326
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:36,080
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

327
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,053
The bolt. The bolt goes in the receiver.

328
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:51,798
Operating-rod handle.

329
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:54,463
Operating-rod guide.

330
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,106
And the left one over the right.

331
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:00,371
Right one over the left.

332
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:05,048
Left one over the right.

333
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:07,483
The right one over the left.

334
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:13,290
Just throw your other leg over.

335
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:19,794
Attaboy.

336
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:25,862
That's it. Now just pull the neXt one over
and you're home free.

337
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,368
Ready?.

338
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:35,373
Just throw it over.

339
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:44,022
Attaboy.

340
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:46,160
Set it down.

341
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,490
All right?.

342
00:20:51,637 --> 00:20:53,525
There you go.

343
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:57,336
Congratulations, Leonard.

344
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,102
You did it.

345
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:02,905
Fold the blanket
and the sheet back together.

346
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,415
Make a four-inch fold.

347
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,280
Okay?. Got it?.

348
00:21:08,455 --> 00:21:10,344
You do it.

349
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:14,218
Right shoulder.

350
00:21:14,395 --> 00:21:16,488
Your left shoulder.

351
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:21,664
Port.

352
00:21:26,175 --> 00:21:27,972
Order.

353
00:21:50,536 --> 00:21:53,494
Your right shoulder.

354
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:59,503
Square these weapons away.

355
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,534
My Corps' arms should be
parallel to the....

356
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:07,981
The deadliest weapon in the world...

357
00:22:08,155 --> 00:22:12,012
...is a Marine and his rifle.

358
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:15,684
It is your killer instinct
which must be harnessed...

359
00:22:15,863 --> 00:22:19,925
...if you eXpect to survive in combat.

360
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:23,628
Your rifle is only a tool.

361
00:22:23,805 --> 00:22:26,366
It is a hard heart that kills.

362
00:22:27,176 --> 00:22:32,000
If your killer instincts
are not clean and strong...

363
00:22:32,181 --> 00:22:35,208
...you will hesitate
at the moment of truth.

364
00:22:35,385 --> 00:22:37,376
You will not kill.

365
00:22:37,554 --> 00:22:39,920
You will become dead-Marine.

366
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,423
And then you will be in a world of shit.

367
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:45,324
Because Marines...

368
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:49,091
...are not allowed to die
without permission.

369
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,928
Do you maggots understand?.

370
00:22:51,102 --> 00:22:52,626
Sir, yes, sir.

371
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,004
I love working for Uncle Sam

372
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,940

I don 't know, but I've been told

385
00:23:30,145 --> 00:23:32,910
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

386
00:23:33,082 --> 00:23:35,880
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

T oe jam.

397
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:01,577
Pop that blister.

398
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:13,146
Jesus H. Christ.

399
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:17,325
Private Pyle,
why is your footlocker unlocked?.

400
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,657
Sir, I don't know, sir.

401
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:22,291
Private Pyle, if there is one thing
in this world that I hate...

402
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,769
...it is an unlocked footlocker.
You know that, don't you?.

403
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,500
-Sir, yes, sir.
-lf it wasn't for dickheads like you...

404
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:31,237
...there wouldn't be thievery
in the world, would there?.

405
00:24:31,413 --> 00:24:33,369
-Sir, no, sir.
-Get down.

406
00:24:37,753 --> 00:24:41,576
Well, now, let's just see
if there's anything missing.

407
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:46,355
Holy Jesus.

408
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:48,327
What is that?.

409
00:24:48,499 --> 00:24:51,093
What the fuck is that?.

410
00:24:51,268 --> 00:24:52,963
What is that, Private Pyle?.

411
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:54,399
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir.

412
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:56,938
-A jelly doughnut?.
-Sir, yes, sir.

413
00:24:57,108 --> 00:25:00,169
-How did it get here?.
-Sir, I took it from the mess hall, sir.

414
00:25:00,345 --> 00:25:02,472
Is chow allowed in the barracks,
Private Pyle?.

415
00:25:02,647 --> 00:25:06,378
-Sir, no, sir.
-Are you allowed to eat jelly doughnuts?.

416
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:08,918
-Sir, no, sir.
-And why not, Private Pyle?.

417
00:25:09,088 --> 00:25:10,749
Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir.

418
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:15,951
-Because you are a disgusting fat-body.
-Sir, yes, sir.

419
00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:19,691
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut
in your footlocker, Private Pyle?.

420
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:21,823
Sir, because I was hungry, sir.

421
00:25:22,002 --> 00:25:25,096
Because you were hungry.

422
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:32,298
Private Pyle has dishonored himself...

423
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,108
...and dishonored the platoon.

424
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:39,243
I have tried to help him,
but I have failed.

425
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:44,313
I have failed
because you have not helped me.

426
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:48,555
You people have not given Private Pyle...

427
00:25:48,732 --> 00:25:50,927
...the proper motivation.

428
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:56,596
So from now on,
whenever Private Pyle fucks up...

429
00:25:56,774 --> 00:25:59,038
...I will not punish him.

430
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,701
I will punish all of you.

431
00:26:01,846 --> 00:26:03,939
And the way I see it, ladies...

432
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:07,176
...you owe me for one jelly doughnut.

433
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:10,048
Now get on your faces.

434
00:26:11,456 --> 00:26:13,185
Open your mouth.

435
00:26:13,358 --> 00:26:15,850
They're paying for it, you eat it.

436
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:18,395
Ready, eXercise.

437
00:26:18,565 --> 00:26:21,193

00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,983
You really look like shit today, Leonard.

447
00:26:52,336 --> 00:26:54,065
Joker.

448
00:26:56,473 --> 00:26:59,237
Everybody hates me now.

449
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:03,644
Even you.

450
00:27:06,684 --> 00:27:09,016
Nobody hates you, Leonard.

451
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:11,683
You just keep making mistakes.

452
00:27:11,857 --> 00:27:14,155
Getting everybody in trouble.

453
00:27:17,062 --> 00:27:19,622
I can't do anything right.

454
00:27:22,135 --> 00:27:24,057
I need help.

455
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:29,940
I'm trying to help you, Leonard.

456
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,806
I'm really trying.

457
00:27:35,983 --> 00:27:38,110
Tuck your shirt in.

One, two, three, 30.

470
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,138
Do it.

471
00:29:36,283 --> 00:29:37,511
Do it.

472
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:49,991
Remember, it's just a bad dream, fat-boy.

473
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:20,127
Port.

474
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:24,358
Left shoulder.

475
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:29,369
Right shoulder.

476
00:30:32,979 --> 00:30:34,537
Port.

477
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:40,507
Do we love our beloved Corps, ladies?.

478
00:30:40,688 --> 00:30:45,011
Semper fi, do or die.
Gung ho. Gung ho. Gung ho.

479
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:47,319
What makes the grass grow?.

480
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,461
Blood, blood, blood.

481
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:52,361
What do we do for a living, ladies?.

482
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:54,229
Kill, kill, kill.

483
00:30:54,402 --> 00:30:55,994
I can't hear you.

484
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:57,866
Kill, kill, kill.

485
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:01,100
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.

486
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:02,904
Kill, kill, kill.

487
00:31:03,846 --> 00:31:07,612
Do any of you people know
who Charles Whitman was?.

488
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,610
None of you dumb-asses knows?.

489
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:13,950
Private Cowboy.

490
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:18,482
Sir, he was that guy who shot all those
people from that tower in Austin, TeXas, sir.

491
00:31:18,663 --> 00:31:21,496
That's affirmative.
Charles Whitman killed 1 2 people...

492
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:25,864
...from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of TeXas.

493
00:31:26,037 --> 00:31:28,927
From distances of up to 400 yards.

494
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:32,940
Anybody know
who Lee Harvey Oswald was?.

495
00:31:33,112 --> 00:31:34,170
Private Snowball.

496
00:31:34,947 --> 00:31:36,676
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir.

497
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,683
That's right.
And do you know how far away he was?.

498
00:31:39,853 --> 00:31:44,176
Sir, he was pretty far.
From that book-suppository building, sir.

499
00:31:44,357 --> 00:31:46,314
All right, knock it off.

500
00:31:46,494 --> 00:31:48,382
Two hundred and fifty feet.

501
00:31:48,563 --> 00:31:52,761
He was 250 feet away
and shooting at a moving target.

502
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:58,532
Oswald got off three rounds with an old
ltalian bolt-action rifle in only siX seconds...

503
00:31:58,707 --> 00:32:02,165
...and scored two hits,
including a head shot.

504
00:32:02,344 --> 00:32:06,509
Do any of you people know where
these individuals learned how to shoot?.

505
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,044
Private Joker.

506
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:11,141
Sir, in the Marines, sir.

507
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:13,846
In the Marines. Outstanding.

508
00:32:14,023 --> 00:32:18,984
Those individuals showed what one
motivated Marine and his rifle can do.

509
00:32:19,163 --> 00:32:21,723
And before you ladies leave my island...

510
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:25,233
...you will all be able
to do the same thing.

511
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:46,987
Today...

512
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,321
...is Christmas.

513
00:32:49,496 --> 00:32:54,696
There will be a magic show at 0930.

514
00:32:55,069 --> 00:32:58,630
Chaplain Charlie will tell you...

515
00:32:58,806 --> 00:33:03,369
...about how the free world
will conquer communism...

516
00:33:03,545 --> 00:33:08,175
...with the aid of God and a few Marines.

517
00:33:08,717 --> 00:33:12,643
God has a hard-on for Marines...

518
00:33:12,822 --> 00:33:17,486
...because we kill everything we see.

519
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:20,050
He plays his games...

520
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,927
...we play ours.

521
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,958
To show our appreciation
for so much power...

522
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:33,498
...we keep heaven packed
with fresh souls.

523
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:38,238
God was here before the Marine Corps.

524
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:41,410
So you can give your heart to Jesus...

525
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:45,284
...but your ass belongs to the Corps.

526
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:47,414
Do you ladies understand?.

527
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:50,586
-Sir, yes, sir.
-I can't hear you.

528
00:33:50,764 --> 00:33:52,595
Sir, yes, sir.

529
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:01,672
It's been swabbed and brushed.

530
00:34:03,044 --> 00:34:04,841
Everything...

531
00:34:05,747 --> 00:34:07,578
...is clean.

532
00:34:11,487 --> 00:34:13,250
Beautiful.

533
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:17,485
So that it slides perfect.

534
00:34:19,863 --> 00:34:21,091
Nice.

535
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,561
Everything clean.

536
00:34:26,403 --> 00:34:27,996
Oiled.

537
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:33,230
So that your action is beautiful.

538
00:34:37,215 --> 00:34:39,446
Smooth Charlene.

539
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:04,200
Leonard talks to his rifle.

540
00:35:06,448 --> 00:35:08,075
Yeah.

541
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:18,518
I don't think Leonard
can hack it anymore.

542
00:35:19,796 --> 00:35:22,458
I think Leonard's a Section Eight.

543
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:27,991
It don't surprise me.

544
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:41,882
I wanna slip my tube steak
into your sister.

545
00:35:44,957 --> 00:35:47,152
What will you take in trade?.

546
00:35:49,361 --> 00:35:51,283
What do you got?.

547
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,540
Outstanding, Private Pyle.

548
00:36:07,715 --> 00:36:10,411
I think we finally found
something that you do well.

549
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,451
Sir, yes, sir.

550
00:36:15,824 --> 00:36:17,621
What's your siXth general order?.

551
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:20,284
Sir, the siXth general order
is to receive and obey...

552
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,853
...and pass on to the sentry
who relieves me...

553
00:36:23,032 --> 00:36:24,795
...all orders....

554
00:36:24,968 --> 00:36:26,731
Sir, the private's siXth general....

555
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:29,325
The private has been instructed
but does not know.

556
00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:32,772
You slimy scumbag,
get on your face and give me 25.

557
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:35,036
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

558
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:41,616
How many counts in that movement
you just eXecuted?.

559
00:36:41,786 --> 00:36:44,949
-Sir, four counts, sir.
-What's the idea of looking in the chamber?.

560
00:36:45,123 --> 00:36:49,389
Sir, to guarantee the private is not giving
the inspecting officer a loaded weapon, sir.

561
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:51,052
What's your fifth general order?.

562
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:55,257
Sir, the fifth general order is to quit my post
only when properly relieved, sir.

563
00:36:55,434 --> 00:36:57,231
What's this weapon's name,
Private Pyle?.

564
00:36:57,403 --> 00:37:00,237
Sir, the private's weapon's name
is Charlene, sir.

565
00:37:00,407 --> 00:37:03,171
Private Pyle, you are definitely
born-again hard.

566
00:37:03,343 --> 00:37:06,938
Hell, I may even allow you to serve
as a rifleman in my beloved Corps.

567
00:37:07,114 --> 00:37:09,207
Sir, yes, sir.

568
00:37:11,653 --> 00:37:14,315
I don 't want no teenage queen

569
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:17,083
I don 't want no teenage queen

570
00:37:17,258 --> 00:37:19,921
I just want my M14

571
00:37:20,095 --> 00:37:22,689
I just want my M14

572
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,561
If I die in a combat zone

573
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:28,294
If I die in a combat zone

574
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:31,031
Box me up and ship me home

575
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,835
Box me up and ship me home

576
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,638
Pin my medals upon my chest

577
00:37:36,813 --> 00:37:39,408
Pin my medals upon my chest

578
00:37:39,584 --> 00:37:42,178
Tell my mom I done my best

579
00:37:42,004 --> 00:37:44,495
Tell my mom I done my best

580
00:37:46,008 --> 00:37:49,604
Graduation is only a few days away...

581
00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:54,341
...and the recruits of Platoon 3092
are salty.

582
00:37:54,517 --> 00:37:58,477
They are ready to eat their own guts
and ask for seconds.

583
00:37:59,056 --> 00:38:04,483
The drill instructors are proud to see
that we are growing beyond their control.

584
00:38:04,862 --> 00:38:08,253
The Marine Corps does not want robots.

585
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:11,391
The Marine Corps wants killers.

586
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:15,336
The Marine Corps wants to build
indestructible men.

587
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:18,306
Men without fear.

588
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:24,840
T oday, you people are
no longer maggots.

589
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,982
T oday, you are Marines.

590
00:38:30,557 --> 00:38:33,390
You 're part of a brotherhood.

591
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,657
From now on, until the day you die...

592
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:40,130
...wherever you are...

593
00:38:40,302 --> 00:38:43,794
...every Marine is your brother.

594
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:48,001
Most of you will go to Vietnam.

595
00:38:48,177 --> 00:38:51,408
Some of you will not come back.

596
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,775
But always remember this:

597
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,815
Marines die.

598
00:38:55,986 --> 00:38:58,511
That's what we're here for.

599
00:38:58,689 --> 00:39:01,783
But the Marine Corps lives forever...

600
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:06,692
...and that means you live forever.

601
00:39:10,568 --> 00:39:12,229
-Peckett.
-Sir, yes, sir.

1 800, Engineers.

607
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,305
You go out and find mines.

608
00:39:23,483 --> 00:39:25,280
-Cowboy.
-Sir, yes, sir.

-Joker.
-Sir, yes, sir.

613
00:39:32,793 --> 00:39:35,921
421 2, Basic Military Journalism.

614
00:39:36,097 --> 00:39:38,156
You gotta be shitting me, Joker.

615
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:39,856
You think you're Mickey Spillane?.

616
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:42,060
You think you're some kind
of fucking writer?.

617
00:39:42,237 --> 00:39:44,660
Sir, I wrote for
my high school newspaper, sir.

618
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,503
Jesus H. Christ.
You're not a writer, you're a killer.

619
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,905
A killer, yes, sir.

620
00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:51,637
Gomer Pyle.

621
00:39:51,814 --> 00:39:54,408
-Gomer Pyle.
-Sir, yes, sir.

622
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:58,509
You forget your fucking name?.
0300, lnfantry. You made it.

623
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,816
-Perkins.
-Sir, yes, sir.

624
00:40:04,995 --> 00:40:07,828
Our last night on the island.

625
00:40:07,998 --> 00:40:10,524
I draw fire watch.

626
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:16,466
Hi, Joker.

627
00:41:38,465 --> 00:41:41,992
Are those live rounds?.

628
00:41:48,009 --> 00:41:51,831
Seven-siX-two millimeter.

629
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:56,872
Full metal jacket.

630
00:42:05,462 --> 00:42:07,384
Leonard...

631
00:42:07,564 --> 00:42:11,421
...if Hartman comes in here
and catches us...

632
00:42:12,602 --> 00:42:15,663
...we'll both be in a world of shit.

633
00:42:18,943 --> 00:42:21,241
I am...

634
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,970
...in a world...

635
00:42:26,518 --> 00:42:29,043
...of shit.

636
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:33,520
Left shoulder.

637
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,494
Right shoulder.

638
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,862
Lock and load.

639
00:42:46,674 --> 00:42:48,039
Order.

640
00:42:50,878 --> 00:42:52,676
This is my rifle.

641
00:42:52,847 --> 00:42:55,611
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

642
00:42:56,885 --> 00:43:00,184
My rifle is my best friend.
It is my life.

643
00:43:00,355 --> 00:43:02,847
Get back in your bunks.

644
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:05,186
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?.

645
00:43:05,361 --> 00:43:10,219
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals doing in my head?.

646
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:13,733
Why is Private Pyle out of his bunk
after lights out?.

647
00:43:13,904 --> 00:43:16,737
Why is Private Pyle
holding that weapon?.

648
00:43:16,907 --> 00:43:20,264
Why aren't you stomping
Private Pyle's guts out?.

649
00:43:20,445 --> 00:43:23,642
Sir, it is the private's duty
to inform the senior drill instructor...

650
00:43:23,815 --> 00:43:28,548
...that Private Pyle has a full magazine
and has locked and loaded, sir.

651
00:43:36,128 --> 00:43:39,860
Now you listen to me, Private Pyle...

652
00:43:40,033 --> 00:43:42,797
...and you listen good.

653
00:43:43,236 --> 00:43:45,500
I want that weapon...

654
00:43:45,672 --> 00:43:48,300
...and I want it now.

655
00:43:48,809 --> 00:43:53,075
You will place that rifle
on the deck at your feet...

656
00:43:53,247 --> 00:43:56,080
...and step back away from it.

657
00:44:03,525 --> 00:44:07,017
What is your major malfunction,
numb-nuts?.

658
00:44:07,195 --> 00:44:11,462
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you
enough attention when you were a child?.

659
00:44:37,029 --> 00:44:39,088
Easy, Leonard.

660
00:44:42,568 --> 00:44:44,627
Go easy, man.

661
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,560
No!

662
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:13,728
Hey, baby.

663
00:46:13,903 --> 00:46:16,929
You got girlfriend Vietnam?.

664
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:19,734
Not just this minute.

665
00:46:19,909 --> 00:46:23,209
Well, baby, me so horny.

666
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,541
Me so horny.

667
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:28,275
Me love you long time.

668
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,048
You party?.

669
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:32,348
Yeah, we might party.

670
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:35,321
-How much?.
-Fifteen dollar.

671
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:39,521
-Fifteen dollars for both of us.
-No. Each you $1 5.

672
00:46:39,698 --> 00:46:41,620
Me love you long time.

673
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,428
Me so horny.

674
00:46:44,603 --> 00:46:46,901
Fifteen dollar too beaucoup.

675
00:46:47,072 --> 00:46:50,338
-Five dollars each.
-Me sucky-sucky.

676
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:53,104
Me love you too much.

677
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:57,813
Five dollars is all my mom
allows me to spend.

678
00:46:57,984 --> 00:47:00,909
Okay. Ten dollar each.

679
00:47:01,088 --> 00:47:03,579
What do we get for $1 0?.

680
00:47:03,757 --> 00:47:06,555
Everything you want.

681
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:09,891
-Everything?.
-Everything.

682
00:47:10,932 --> 00:47:15,028
Well, old buddy, feel like spending
some of your hard-earned money?.

683
00:47:15,203 --> 00:47:17,091
Just a minute.

684
00:47:17,439 --> 00:47:21,570
You know, half these gook whores
are serving officers in the Vietcong.

685
00:47:21,744 --> 00:47:23,507
The other half have got TB.

686
00:47:24,347 --> 00:47:27,203
Be sure you only fuck
the ones that cough.

687
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:18,869
That little sucker really had
some moves on him, didn't he?.

688
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:20,702
Yeah.

689
00:48:22,511 --> 00:48:25,106
You know what really pisses me off
about these people?.

690
00:48:25,281 --> 00:48:26,612
What?.

691
00:48:26,816 --> 00:48:30,638
We're supposed to be helping them, and
they shit all over us every chance they get.

692
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,776
I just can't feature that.

693
00:48:32,956 --> 00:48:36,415
Don't take it too hard, Rafterman.
It's just business.

694
00:48:38,228 --> 00:48:41,584
I hate Da Nang, Joker.
I wanna go out into the field.

695
00:48:41,765 --> 00:48:43,722
I've been in country
almost three months...

696
00:48:43,902 --> 00:48:46,666
...and all I do is take handshake shots
at award ceremonies.

697
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:49,864
You'd get wasted your first day in the field
and it'd be my fault.

698
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:52,339
A high school girl could do my job.

699
00:48:52,511 --> 00:48:54,308
I wanna get out into the shit.

700
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,074
I wanna get some trigger time.

701
00:48:57,984 --> 00:49:01,476
If you get killed, your mom will find me
after I rotate back to the world...

702
00:49:01,654 --> 00:49:03,418
...and she'll beat the shit out of me.

703
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:06,081
That's a negative, Rafterman.

704
00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:12,789
Okay, guys. Let's keep it short and sweet
today. Anybody got anything new?.

705
00:49:15,136 --> 00:49:18,799
There's a rumor going around that
the Tet ceasefire is gonna be canceled.

706
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,730
Rear-echelon paranoia.

707
00:49:21,076 --> 00:49:25,206
A bro in intelligence says Charlie might try
to pull off something big during Tet.

708
00:49:25,381 --> 00:49:27,872
They say the same thing every year.

709
00:49:28,017 --> 00:49:29,814
There's a lot of talk about it, sir.

710
00:49:29,985 --> 00:49:31,783
I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.

711
00:49:31,955 --> 00:49:36,119
The Tet holiday is like the Fourth of July,
Christmas and New Year all rolled into one.

712
00:49:36,292 --> 00:49:39,648
Every zipperhead in Nam,
North and South, will be banging gongs...

713
00:49:39,829 --> 00:49:42,685
...barking at the moon
and visiting his dead relatives.

714
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,456
Right. Ann-Margret
and entourage are due here neXt week.

715
00:49:46,637 --> 00:49:49,903
I want someone on the airfield
and stick with her for a couple of days.

716
00:49:50,075 --> 00:49:52,566
-Rafterman, you take it.
-Aye, aye, sir.

717
00:49:52,711 --> 00:49:54,406
And get some good low-angle stuff.

718
00:49:54,579 --> 00:49:58,640
Don't make it too obvious,
but I wanna see fur and early-morning dew.

719
00:49:58,817 --> 00:50:01,082
-Yes, sir.
-""Diplomats in dungarees.

720
00:50:01,254 --> 00:50:04,951
Marine engineers lend a helping hand
rebuilding Dong Phuc village recently....""

721
00:50:05,124 --> 00:50:08,423
Chili, if we move Vietnamese,
they are evacuees...

722
00:50:08,595 --> 00:50:11,689
...if they come to us to be evacuated,
they are refugees.

723
00:50:11,865 --> 00:50:13,628
I'll make a note of it, sir.

724
00:50:14,301 --> 00:50:16,826
""NVA soldier deserts
after reading pamphlets.

725
00:50:17,004 --> 00:50:21,032
A young North Vietnamese Army regular,
who realized his side could not win...

726
00:50:21,209 --> 00:50:24,007
...deserted from his unit after reading
Open Arms pamphlets.""

727
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:27,273
That's good, Dave. But why say
North Vietnamese Army regular?.

728
00:50:27,449 --> 00:50:31,181
Is there an irregular?.
How about North Vietnamese Army soldier?.

729
00:50:31,353 --> 00:50:32,411
I'll fiX it up, sir.

730
00:50:32,855 --> 00:50:34,880
Lawrence Welk Show
is out on TV in two weeks.

731
00:50:35,057 --> 00:50:36,217
Dave, do 1 00 words on it.

732
00:50:36,392 --> 00:50:38,918
-AFTV will give you some background stuff.
-Sir.

733
00:50:39,096 --> 00:50:40,859
"" Not while we're eating.

734
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:43,556
NVA learned Marines
on a search-and-destroy mission...

735
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:46,065
...don't like to be interrupted
while eating chow.""

736
00:50:46,236 --> 00:50:50,128
Search-and-destroy. We have a new
directive from MAF on this.

737
00:50:50,408 --> 00:50:54,902
In future, in place of search-and-destroy,
substitute the phrase sweep-and-clear.

738
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:58,379
-Sweep-and-clear, got it?.
-Got it. Very catchy.

739
00:50:59,218 --> 00:51:01,482
And, Joker, where's the weenie?.

740
00:51:02,054 --> 00:51:03,612
Sir?.

741
00:51:03,789 --> 00:51:07,715
The kill, Joker. The kill. I mean, all that fire,
the grunts must have hit something.

742
00:51:07,894 --> 00:51:09,156
Didn't see them.

743
00:51:10,196 --> 00:51:13,586
Joker, I've told you,
we run two basic stories here.

744
00:51:13,766 --> 00:51:17,225
Grunts who give half their pay to buy
gooks toothbrushes and deodorants.

745
00:51:17,404 --> 00:51:19,668
Winning of hearts and minds. Okay?.

746
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,435
And combat action that results in a kill.
Winning the war.

747
00:51:23,611 --> 00:51:27,309
Now, you must have seen blood trails.
Drag marks?.

748
00:51:27,482 --> 00:51:29,143
It was raining, sir.

749
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:32,484
Well, that's why God passed
the law of probability.

750
00:51:32,654 --> 00:51:35,749
Now rewrite it and give it
a happy ending. Say, one killed.

751
00:51:35,925 --> 00:51:38,291
Make it a sapper or an officer. Which?.

752
00:51:38,794 --> 00:51:40,125
Whichever you say.

753
00:51:40,296 --> 00:51:42,787
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

754
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:46,164
Okay, an officer. How about a general?.

755
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:47,934
Joker...

756
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:51,495
...maybe you'd like our guys
to read the paper and feel bad.

757
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:54,804
I mean, in case you didn't know it,
this is not a very popular war.

758
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:57,106
Now, it is our job to report the news...

759
00:51:57,282 --> 00:52:00,342
...that these why-are-we-here
civilian newsmen ignore.

760
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,715
Sir, maybe you should go out
on some ops yourself.

761
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:08,621
I'm sure you could find a lot more
blood trails and drag marks.

762
00:52:09,228 --> 00:52:11,219
Joker, I've had my ass in the grass.

763
00:52:11,397 --> 00:52:13,354
Can't say I liked it much.

764
00:52:13,533 --> 00:52:16,525
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

765
00:52:16,703 --> 00:52:19,729
As it happens, my present duties
keep me where I belong...

766
00:52:19,906 --> 00:52:22,102
...in the rear with the gear.

767
00:52:29,817 --> 00:52:32,616
Tet. The year of the monkey.

768
00:52:32,788 --> 00:52:35,916
Vietnamese Lunar New Year's Eve.

769
00:52:36,091 --> 00:52:41,189
Down in Dogpatch, the gooks are
shooting off fireworks to celebrate.

770
00:52:49,906 --> 00:52:53,570
I am fucking bored to death, man.

771
00:52:54,178 --> 00:52:56,669
I gotta get back in the shit.

772
00:52:56,814 --> 00:52:59,909
I ain't heard a shot fired
in anger in weeks.

773
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,084
Joker's so tough...

774
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,710
...he'd eat the boogers
out of a dead man's nose...

775
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:07,778
...then ask for seconds.

776
00:53:08,293 --> 00:53:10,353
Listen up, pilgrim.

777
00:53:10,529 --> 00:53:15,023
A day without blood is
like a day without sunshine.

778
00:53:15,501 --> 00:53:16,798
Shit.

779
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:20,861
Joker thinks the bad bush is between
an old mama-san's legs.

780
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:22,963
He's never been in the shit.

781
00:53:23,143 --> 00:53:25,873
It's hard to talk about it, man.
It's like on Hastings.

782
00:53:26,046 --> 00:53:28,572
You weren't on
Operation Hastings, Payback.

783
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,412
-You weren't even in country.
-Eat shit and die...

784
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:34,441
...you fucking Spanish-American.
You fucking pogue.

785
00:53:34,622 --> 00:53:36,021
I was there, man.

786
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:37,920
I was in the shit with the grunts.

787
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:41,881
Don't listen to
any of Payback's bullshit, Rafterman.

788
00:53:42,064 --> 00:53:45,454
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.

789
00:53:46,168 --> 00:53:47,659
You listen to Joker, new guy.

790
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:49,431
He knows ti ti.

791
00:53:49,606 --> 00:53:51,130
Very little.

792
00:53:51,308 --> 00:53:54,106
You know he's never been in the shit.
He ain't got the stare.

793
00:53:54,277 --> 00:53:57,805
-The stare?.
-The thousand-yard stare.

794
00:53:57,982 --> 00:54:00,974
A Marine gets it after he's been
in the shit for too long.

795
00:54:01,152 --> 00:54:02,676
It's like--

796
00:54:03,087 --> 00:54:04,975
It's like you're really seeing beyond.

797
00:54:05,723 --> 00:54:06,952
I got it.

798
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:08,956
All field Marines got it.

799
00:54:09,127 --> 00:54:10,617
And you'll have it too.

800
00:54:10,796 --> 00:54:12,093
I will?.

801
00:54:12,264 --> 00:54:13,822
Hey, Payback...

802
00:54:13,999 --> 00:54:17,094
...how do you stop five black dudes
from raping a white chick?.

803
00:54:17,704 --> 00:54:20,593
-Fuck you, Stork.
-Throw them a basketball.

804
00:54:25,612 --> 00:54:27,705
-lncoming.
-Oh, shit.

805
00:54:29,383 --> 00:54:31,271
Them are outgoing.

806
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,451
-That ain't outgoing.
-That ain't outgoing.

807
00:54:35,623 --> 00:54:37,250
Now, what did I just say?.

808
00:55:15,367 --> 00:55:18,598
Hey, I hope they're just fucking with us.

809
00:55:18,771 --> 00:55:22,036
-I ain't ready for this shit.
-Amen.

810
00:56:14,966 --> 00:56:16,854
Cease fire.

811
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,067
-Cease fire.
-Cease fire.

812
00:56:26,712 --> 00:56:28,704
Cease fire.

813
00:56:39,694 --> 00:56:41,685
The enemy...

814
00:56:41,863 --> 00:56:44,354
...has very deceitfully...

815
00:56:44,532 --> 00:56:47,387
...taken advantage
of the Tet ceasefire...

816
00:56:47,568 --> 00:56:50,902
...to launch an offensive
all over the country.

817
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,903
So far, we 've had it pretty easy here.

818
00:56:55,077 --> 00:56:57,273
But we seem to be the exception.

819
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:02,769
Charlie has hit every major military target
in Vietnam and hit them hard.

820
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:08,812
In Saigon the United States Embassy
has been overrun by suicide squads.

821
00:57:08,993 --> 00:57:10,915
-Shit.
-Jesus Christ, man.

822
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:14,622
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.

823
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,461
We also have reports
that a division of NVA...

824
00:57:18,637 --> 00:57:23,563
...has occupied all of the city of Hue
south of the Perfume River.

825
00:57:23,742 --> 00:57:26,803
In strategic terms,
Charlie's cut the country in half...

826
00:57:26,979 --> 00:57:29,743
...the civilian press
are about to wet their pants...

827
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:34,842
...and we've heard even Cronkite's
gonna say the war is now unwinnable.

828
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:37,184
In other words...

829
00:57:37,357 --> 00:57:42,181
...it's a huge shit sandwich
and we're all gonna have to take a bite.

830
00:57:45,066 --> 00:57:46,829
Sir.

831
00:57:47,135 --> 00:57:49,990
Does this mean that Ann-Margret's
not coming?.

832
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:59,167
Joker, I want you
to get straight up to Phu Bai.

833
00:57:59,648 --> 00:58:02,845
Captain January will need all his people.

834
00:58:03,018 --> 00:58:05,283
-Yes, sir.
-And, Joker...

835
00:58:05,455 --> 00:58:08,447
...you will take off that damn button.

836
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:12,049
How's it gonna look if you get killed
wearing a peace symbol?.

837
00:58:12,228 --> 00:58:13,719
Sir.

838
00:58:13,864 --> 00:58:16,059
Permission to go with Joker?.

839
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:18,723
-Permission granted.
-Thank you, sir.

840
00:58:18,903 --> 00:58:21,827
Sir, permission not to take
Rafterman with me?.

841
00:58:22,006 --> 00:58:24,100
You still here?.

842
00:58:24,276 --> 00:58:27,905
Vanish, Joker, most ricky-tick,
and take Rafterman with you.

843
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,412
You're responsible for him.

844
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:07,882
Get some.

845
00:59:08,724 --> 00:59:10,454
Get some.

846
00:59:13,063 --> 00:59:15,952
Get some. Get some. Yeah. Yeah.

847
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:20,699
Get some. Get some.
Come on. Come on.

848
00:59:24,742 --> 00:59:26,334
Get some.

849
00:59:33,852 --> 00:59:36,013
Get some, baby.

850
00:59:36,355 --> 00:59:38,745
Get some. Get some. Get some.

851
00:59:39,759 --> 00:59:42,387
Get some. Get some, come on.
Get it, come on.

852
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:45,053
Get some. Get some. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

853
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:47,426
I've got you, mother.

854
00:59:52,273 --> 00:59:55,401
Anyone who runs is a VC.

855
00:59:55,976 --> 00:59:58,502
Anyone who stands still...

856
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,604
...is a well-disciplined VC.

857
01:00:03,552 --> 01:00:07,181
You guys ought to do a story
about me sometime.

858
01:00:08,357 --> 01:00:11,417
Why should we do a story about you?.

859
01:00:11,794 --> 01:00:13,887
Because I'm so fucking good.

860
01:00:14,063 --> 01:00:16,190
That ain't no shit neither.

861
01:00:16,365 --> 01:00:20,826
I've done got me 1 57 dead gooks killed.

862
01:00:21,004 --> 01:00:23,768
And 50 water buffaloes too.

863
01:00:23,941 --> 01:00:26,740
Them are all certified.

864
01:00:26,911 --> 01:00:29,766
Any women or children?.

865
01:00:30,281 --> 01:00:31,908
Sometimes.

866
01:00:33,051 --> 01:00:36,749
How can you shoot women and children?.

867
01:00:37,356 --> 01:00:38,653
Easy.

868
01:00:38,824 --> 01:00:41,213
You just don't lead them so much.

869
01:00:42,762 --> 01:00:44,718
Ain't war hell?.

870
01:01:21,304 --> 01:01:23,432
Top, we wanna get in the shit.

871
01:01:23,607 --> 01:01:25,097
Down the road. Two-Five.

872
01:01:25,276 --> 01:01:28,040
Two-Five. Outstanding. Thanks, Top.

873
01:01:52,806 --> 01:01:54,433
EXcuse me.

874
01:01:54,608 --> 01:01:55,973
Sir.

875
01:01:56,143 --> 01:01:59,237
We're looking for 1 st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

876
01:01:59,413 --> 01:02:00,846
I got a bro named Cowboy there.

877
01:02:01,014 --> 01:02:02,414
You people one-one?.

878
01:02:02,584 --> 01:02:04,882
No, sir.
We're reporters from Stars and Stripes.

879
01:02:05,053 --> 01:02:06,884
-Stars and Stripes?
-Yes, sir.

880
01:02:07,055 --> 01:02:09,080
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

881
01:02:09,257 --> 01:02:12,056
Cowboy's just down the road
in the platoon area.

882
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:15,891
-You mind if we tag along, sir?.
-No problem. Welcome aboard.

883
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:19,296
By the way, my name's Schinoski.
Walter J. Schinoski.

884
01:02:19,468 --> 01:02:21,699
My people call me Mr. Touchdown.

885
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:23,362
I played ball for Notre Dame.

886
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:24,837
-Notre Dame?.
-Yeah.

887
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:27,704
-All right.
-You here to make Cowboy famous?.

888
01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:29,470
Never happen, sir.

889
01:02:29,646 --> 01:02:33,913
Well, if you people came looking for a story,
this is your lucky day.

890
01:02:34,085 --> 01:02:37,248
We got Condition Red
and we're definitely eXpecting rain.

891
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:40,186
Outstanding, sir.
We taking care of business?.

892
01:02:40,359 --> 01:02:41,849
Well, the NVA are dug in deep.

893
01:02:42,027 --> 01:02:44,552
Hotel Company's still working
this side of the river...

894
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,925
...street by street and house by house.

895
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:49,091
Charles definitely
got his shit together...

896
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:51,533
...but we're still getting
some decent kills here.

897
01:02:51,704 --> 01:02:55,902
We heard some scuttlebutt, sir, about
the NVA eXecuting a lot of gook civilians.

898
01:02:56,075 --> 01:02:57,508
That's affirmative.

899
01:02:57,677 --> 01:03:01,307
I saw some bodies about a half a klick
this side of Phu Cam Canal.

900
01:03:01,482 --> 01:03:03,643
Will you show me where, sir?.

901
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,578
Here's the canal.

902
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:33,743
The dead have been covered with lime.

903
01:03:34,952 --> 01:03:37,808
The dead know only one thing:

904
01:03:38,489 --> 01:03:41,014
It is better to be alive.

905
01:03:47,333 --> 01:03:48,925
EXcuse me?.

906
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:51,365
-Good morning, lieutenant.
-Morning.

907
01:03:51,537 --> 01:03:55,098
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?.

908
01:03:55,275 --> 01:03:56,708
What outfit are you men with?.

909
01:03:56,876 --> 01:03:59,003
Sir, we're reporters
from Stars and Stripes.

910
01:03:59,279 --> 01:04:00,803
-Oh, I see.
-I'm Sergeant Joker...

911
01:04:00,981 --> 01:04:03,279
...and this photographer is Rafterman.

912
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:06,045
I'm Lieutenant Cleves
and I'm from Hartford, Connecticut.

913
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:09,144
-Have you got a body count, sir?.
-We think it's 20.

914
01:04:09,323 --> 01:04:11,416
Do you know how it happened, sir?.

915
01:04:11,792 --> 01:04:15,559
Well, it seems the NVA came in
with a list of gook names.

916
01:04:15,731 --> 01:04:20,293
Government officials, policemen,
ARVlN officers, school teachers.

917
01:04:20,469 --> 01:04:22,460
They went around
to their houses real polite...

918
01:04:22,637 --> 01:04:25,971
...and asked them to report
the neXt day for political reeducation.

919
01:04:26,476 --> 01:04:28,740
Everybody who turned up got shot.

920
01:04:28,911 --> 01:04:30,538
Some they buried alive.

921
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:32,077
Ready.

922
01:04:33,684 --> 01:04:35,117
Colonel.

923
01:04:36,653 --> 01:04:39,349
Marine, what is that button
on your body armor?.

924
01:04:39,523 --> 01:04:40,785
A peace symbol, sir.

925
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:43,553
-Where did you get it?.
-I don't remember, sir.

926
01:04:43,995 --> 01:04:45,860
What is that written on your helmet?.

927
01:04:46,031 --> 01:04:47,521
Born to kill, sir.

928
01:04:47,732 --> 01:04:50,690
You write born to kill on your helmet
and wear a peace button.

929
01:04:50,869 --> 01:04:53,202
What's that supposed to be,
some kind of sick joke?.

930
01:04:53,372 --> 01:04:55,932
-No, sir.
-What is it supposed to mean?.

931
01:04:56,108 --> 01:04:57,473
I don't know, sir.

932
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:59,133
-You don't know much.
-No, sir.

933
01:04:59,278 --> 01:05:02,544
Get your head and your ass wired together
or I will take a shit on you.

934
01:05:02,716 --> 01:05:04,445
-Yes, sir.
-Now answer my question...

935
01:05:04,618 --> 01:05:06,984
...or you'll be standing tall
before the man.

936
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:10,112
I was trying to suggest something
about the duality of man, sir.

937
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:13,886
-The what?.
-The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir.

938
01:05:15,096 --> 01:05:17,326
-Whose side are you on, son?.
-Our side, sir.

939
01:05:17,498 --> 01:05:19,125
-You love your country?.
-Yes, sir.

940
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,893
How about getting with the program.

941
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:23,493
Jump on the team and come on in
for the big win.

942
01:05:23,672 --> 01:05:24,696
Yes, sir.

943
01:05:24,873 --> 01:05:29,333
All I've asked of my Marines is for them to
obey my orders as they would God's word.

944
01:05:29,511 --> 01:05:31,241
We are here to help the Vietnamese...

945
01:05:31,414 --> 01:05:35,339
...because inside every gook
there is an American trying to get out.

946
01:05:35,518 --> 01:05:37,179
It's a hardball world, son.

947
01:05:37,353 --> 01:05:40,983
We've gotta try to keep our heads
until this peace craze blows over.

948
01:05:41,158 --> 01:05:42,182
Aye, aye, sir.

949
01:05:52,637 --> 01:05:56,368
Hey, bro. We're looking for 1 st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

950
01:05:56,541 --> 01:05:58,338
Around the back.

951
01:06:06,953 --> 01:06:10,048
-First Platoon?.
-Yeah, through there.

952
01:06:33,749 --> 01:06:35,808
Hey, Lone Ranger.

953
01:06:39,856 --> 01:06:43,519
-Holy shit. It's the Joker.
-You old motherfucker.

954
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:49,588
What's happening?.

955
01:06:49,767 --> 01:06:53,589
Thought I hoped I'd never see you again,
you piece of shit.

956
01:06:54,105 --> 01:06:55,629
What's happening, man?.

957
01:06:55,807 --> 01:06:59,197
Oh, just waiting to get back
to the land of the big PX.

958
01:06:59,378 --> 01:07:01,334
Yeah?. Well, why go back?.

959
01:07:01,513 --> 01:07:03,037
Here or there, samey-same.

960
01:07:03,215 --> 01:07:04,910
-Been getting any?.
-Only your sister.

961
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:09,180
Well, better my sister than my mom,
though my mom's not bad.

962
01:07:09,789 --> 01:07:12,383
Hey, you Hogs, listen up.

963
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:15,723
This is my bro, Joker, from the lsland,
and this is...?.

964
01:07:15,896 --> 01:07:17,852
-Rafterman.
-Rafterman.

965
01:07:18,032 --> 01:07:20,865
They're from Stars and Stripes.
They'll make you famous.

966
01:07:21,035 --> 01:07:22,332
-Fucking A.
-Yeah.

967
01:07:22,503 --> 01:07:24,426
We're the Lusthog Squad.

968
01:07:24,606 --> 01:07:27,166
We're life-takers and heartbreakers.

969
01:07:27,342 --> 01:07:30,834
We shoot them full of holes
and fill them full of lead.

970
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:37,980
You a photographer?.

971
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:41,982
No, I'm a combat correspondent.

972
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:45,484
Oh, you seen much combat?.

973
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:50,598
Well, I've seen a little on TV.

974
01:07:54,939 --> 01:07:57,703
You're a real comedian.

975
01:07:58,977 --> 01:08:01,707
Well, they call me the Joker.

976
01:08:02,982 --> 01:08:05,473
Well, I got a joke for you.

977
01:08:05,618 --> 01:08:08,883
I'm gonna tear you a new asshole.

978
01:08:12,092 --> 01:08:13,957
Well, pilgrim...

979
01:08:14,127 --> 01:08:19,258
...only after you eat the peanuts
out of my shit.

980
01:08:24,672 --> 01:08:26,765
You talk the talk.

981
01:08:27,975 --> 01:08:30,808
Do you walk the walk?.

982
01:08:35,217 --> 01:08:36,707
Now, you might not believe it...

983
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:42,148
...but under fire, Animal Mother's one of
the finest human beings in the world.

984
01:08:42,325 --> 01:08:46,455
All he needs is somebody to throw
hand grenades at him the rest of his life.

985
01:08:46,629 --> 01:08:50,794
That's a roger, come on.
Sit down. Come on, new guy.

986
01:08:53,537 --> 01:08:55,801
Hey, jungle-bunny.

987
01:08:55,973 --> 01:08:58,771
Thank God for the sickle cell, huh?.

988
01:08:58,942 --> 01:09:00,774
Yeah, Mother.

989
01:09:02,047 --> 01:09:03,844
Hey, photographer.

990
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,275
You wanna take a good picture?.

991
01:09:08,553 --> 01:09:09,987
Here, man.

992
01:09:10,323 --> 01:09:11,813
Take this.

993
01:09:20,667 --> 01:09:23,522
This is my bro.

994
01:09:33,114 --> 01:09:35,207
This is his party.

995
01:09:35,383 --> 01:09:37,545
He's the guest of honor.

996
01:09:38,487 --> 01:09:41,149
Today is his birthday.

997
01:09:41,757 --> 01:09:44,555
Happy birthday, zipperhead.

998
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:47,951
I will never forget this day.

999
01:09:48,131 --> 01:09:53,421
The day I came to Hue City
and fought 1 million NVA gooks.

1000
01:09:53,903 --> 01:09:57,203
I love the little commie bastards, man,
I really do.

1001
01:09:57,675 --> 01:10:00,906
These enemy grunts are as hard
as slant-eyed drill instructors.

1002
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,839
These are great days we're living, bros.

1003
01:10:06,985 --> 01:10:11,012
We are jolly green giants,
walking the earth with guns.

1004
01:10:11,757 --> 01:10:14,146
These people we wasted here today...

1005
01:10:14,326 --> 01:10:17,558
...are the finest human beings
we will ever know.

1006
01:10:19,365 --> 01:10:21,026
After we rotate back to the world...

1007
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,499
...we're gonna miss not having
anyone around who's worth shooting.

1008
01:11:30,977 --> 01:11:33,640
-Stay put, keep your heads down.
-Stay put.

1009
01:11:33,814 --> 01:11:35,441
Stay put.

1010
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,659
Shit.

1011
01:12:00,544 --> 01:12:04,036
Delta SiX Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

1012
01:12:05,749 --> 01:12:09,413
Delta SiX Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

1013
01:12:10,555 --> 01:12:11,920
Delta Six.

1014
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:15,218
Delta SiX, we are receiving incoming fire
from the vill.

1015
01:12:15,693 --> 01:12:17,285
The lieutenant is down.

1016
01:12:17,462 --> 01:12:20,421
We're going to stop here
and check out what's in front of us. Over.

1017
01:12:26,071 --> 01:12:28,563
Okay, Lusthog Squad, listen up.

1018
01:12:29,242 --> 01:12:31,335
Gonna move up these roads
and check the vill.

1019
01:12:31,511 --> 01:12:33,877
I want the third team up this road here.

1020
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:37,939
First and second fire team behind me
up this other road, okay?.

1021
01:12:38,419 --> 01:12:41,274
Let's go. Let's get it done.

1022
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,996
Is that you, John Wayne?. Is this me?.

1023
01:17:11,169 --> 01:17:14,333
Hey, start the cameras.
This is Vietnam: The Movie.

1024
01:17:14,507 --> 01:17:16,873
Yeah, Joker can be John Wayne,
I'll be a horse.

1025
01:17:17,043 --> 01:17:19,705
-T.H.E. Rock can be a rock.
-I'll be Ann-Margret.

1026
01:17:19,879 --> 01:17:21,801
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo.

1027
01:17:21,981 --> 01:17:24,473
-I'll be General Custer.
-Who'll be the lndian?.

1028
01:17:24,652 --> 01:17:27,678
Hey, we'll let the gooks play the lndians.

1029
01:18:05,863 --> 01:18:07,854
You're going home now.

1030
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:13,701
Semper fi.

1031
01:18:16,675 --> 01:18:19,269
We're mean Marines, sir.

1032
01:18:22,649 --> 01:18:24,776
Go easy, bros.

1033
01:18:28,922 --> 01:18:30,982
Better you than me.

1034
01:18:34,695 --> 01:18:37,357
Well, at least they died
for a good cause.

1035
01:18:38,165 --> 01:18:40,396
What cause was that?.

1036
01:18:41,903 --> 01:18:43,461
Freedom.

1037
01:18:44,272 --> 01:18:47,196
Flush out your headgear, new guy.

1038
01:18:48,911 --> 01:18:51,766
You think we waste gooks for freedom?.

1039
01:18:52,915 --> 01:18:55,110
This is a slaughter.

1040
01:18:56,352 --> 01:18:59,880
If I'm gonna get my balls
blown off for a word...

1041
01:19:00,958 --> 01:19:03,847
...my word is poon tang.

1042
01:19:06,597 --> 01:19:09,328
Tough break for Hand Job.

1043
01:19:10,235 --> 01:19:13,693
He was all set
to get shipped out on a medical.

1044
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,197
What was the matter with him?.

1045
01:19:19,545 --> 01:19:22,742
He was jerking off 1 0 times a day.

1046
01:19:23,849 --> 01:19:27,445
It's no shit. At least 1 0 times a day.

1047
01:19:29,389 --> 01:19:34,713
Last week he was sent down to Da Nang
to see the Navy head shrinker.

1048
01:19:35,128 --> 01:19:39,190
The crazy fucker starts jerking off
in the waiting room.

1049
01:19:39,734 --> 01:19:42,294
Instant Section Eight.

1050
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:46,395
He was just waiting
for his papers to clear Division.

1051
01:19:48,911 --> 01:19:51,766
You ready?. Turn over.

1052
01:19:53,315 --> 01:19:55,614
Hue City interviews, roll 34.

1053
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:01,713
Well, like-- Like you see, you know,
it's a major city...

1054
01:20:01,891 --> 01:20:05,419
...so we have to assault with tanks,
we roll in the streets.

1055
01:20:05,596 --> 01:20:07,985
So they send us in first to squat...

1056
01:20:08,165 --> 01:20:11,896
...make sure that there are no little....

1057
01:20:13,037 --> 01:20:16,269
No Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets
to blow the tanks away.

1058
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:18,932
So we clear it out
and we roll the tanks in...

1059
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:21,442
...and basically blow the place to hell.

1060
01:20:22,047 --> 01:20:25,643
When we're in Hue,
when we're in Hue City...

1061
01:20:25,818 --> 01:20:27,774
...it's like a war, you know...

1062
01:20:27,954 --> 01:20:29,842
...Iike what-- What--

1063
01:20:30,022 --> 01:20:33,015
What I thought about a war,
what I thought a war was--

1064
01:20:33,193 --> 01:20:35,684
You know, was supposed to be.

1065
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:39,059
There's the enemy, you kill them.

1066
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:42,795
I don't think there's any question about it.
I mean, we're the best.

1067
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:45,098
I mean, all that bullshit
about the Air Cav....

1068
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:47,400
When the shit hits the fan,
who do they call?.

1069
01:20:47,575 --> 01:20:50,908
They call Mother Green
and her killing machine.

1070
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:54,072
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?.

1071
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:58,675
I don't know.
I belong in Vietnam, I'll tell you that.

1072
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:01,084
Can I quote LBJ?.

1073
01:21:02,626 --> 01:21:06,118
"" I will not send American boys...

1074
01:21:06,296 --> 01:21:08,560
...8 or 1 0,000 miles
around the world...

1075
01:21:08,732 --> 01:21:12,931
...to do a job that Asian boys
ought to be doing for themselves.""

1076
01:21:14,839 --> 01:21:19,162
Personally think they don't really
want to be involved in this war...

1077
01:21:19,343 --> 01:21:23,110
...you know, I mean, like they--
It's sort of like...

1078
01:21:23,649 --> 01:21:27,039
...they took away our freedom
and gave it to the gookers, you know.

1079
01:21:27,219 --> 01:21:28,777
But they don't want it.

1080
01:21:28,954 --> 01:21:31,378
They'd rather be alive than free, I guess,
you know.

1081
01:21:31,557 --> 01:21:33,548
Poor, dumb bastards.

1082
01:21:34,427 --> 01:21:39,160
Well, the ones I'm fighting at
are some pretty-- Pretty bad boys.

1083
01:21:39,332 --> 01:21:41,096
I'm not real....

1084
01:21:42,269 --> 01:21:45,102
I'm not real keen
on some of these fellas...

1085
01:21:45,272 --> 01:21:48,696
...that are supposedly on our side.

1086
01:21:48,876 --> 01:21:51,710
I keep meeting them
coming the other way.

1087
01:21:53,782 --> 01:21:54,806
Yeah.

1088
01:21:55,383 --> 01:21:57,578
I mean, we're getting killed
for these people...

1089
01:21:57,752 --> 01:21:59,914
...and they don't even appreciate it.

1090
01:22:00,589 --> 01:22:02,511
They think it's a big joke.

1091
01:22:03,159 --> 01:22:05,150
Well, if you ask me...

1092
01:22:05,628 --> 01:22:07,653
...we're shooting the wrong gooks.

1093
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:11,658
Well, it depends on the situation.
I mean, I'm here to take combat photos.

1094
01:22:11,835 --> 01:22:15,396
But if the shit gets too thick,
I mean, I'll go to the rifle.

1095
01:22:16,406 --> 01:22:19,171
What do I think about
America's involvement in the war?.

1096
01:22:19,344 --> 01:22:21,107
Well, I think we should win.

1097
01:22:21,746 --> 01:22:23,737
I hate Vietnam.

1098
01:22:23,915 --> 01:22:25,940
There's not one horse
in this whole country.

1099
01:22:26,117 --> 01:22:28,245
They don't have one horse in Vietnam.

1100
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:31,014
There's something
basically wrong with that.

1101
01:22:32,424 --> 01:22:34,380
Well, if they'd send us
more guys, maybe...

1102
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,588
...and bomb the hell out of the North,
they might give up.

1103
01:22:39,366 --> 01:22:44,895
I wanted to see eXotic Vietnam,
the jewel of Southeast Asia.

1104
01:22:45,505 --> 01:22:49,863
I wanted to meet interesting and
stimulating people of an ancient culture...

1105
01:22:50,044 --> 01:22:51,341
...and kill them.

1106
01:22:51,779 --> 01:22:56,604
I wanted to be the first kid on my block
to get a confirmed kill.

1107
01:23:15,305 --> 01:23:17,466
Ten-hut.

1108
01:23:19,276 --> 01:23:20,800
-All right.
-My, oh, my.

1109
01:23:20,978 --> 01:23:23,867
-Good morning, little schoolgirl.
-Look at this lady.

1110
01:23:24,049 --> 01:23:26,142
I'm a little schoolboy too.

1111
01:23:26,518 --> 01:23:27,815
My, my, my.

1112
01:23:28,386 --> 01:23:31,685
-What you got there, chief?.
-Do you want number one fucky?.

1113
01:23:32,857 --> 01:23:35,691
Hey, any of you boys
want number one fucky?.

1114
01:23:35,861 --> 01:23:38,250
I'm so horny,
I can't even get a piece of hand.

1115
01:23:38,431 --> 01:23:41,628
-Me want sucky.
-Sucky, fucky, smoke cigarette in her pussy.

1116
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:44,362
She give you everything you want,
long time.

1117
01:23:44,571 --> 01:23:48,496
Everything you want.
Hey, how much there, chief?.

1118
01:23:48,675 --> 01:23:50,939
-Fifteen dollars each.
-No.

1119
01:23:53,281 --> 01:23:55,943
Fifteen dollar beaucoup money.

1120
01:23:56,117 --> 01:23:57,379
Five dollar each.

1121
01:23:57,552 --> 01:23:59,349
Come on, she love you good.

1122
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,044
Boom-boom long time.

1123
01:24:01,222 --> 01:24:02,918
-Ten dollars.
-Five dollars.

1124
01:24:03,092 --> 01:24:04,582
No. Ten dollars.

1125
01:24:04,726 --> 01:24:06,921
Be glad to trade you some ARVlN rifles.

1126
01:24:07,096 --> 01:24:09,929
Ain't never been fired
and only dropped once.

1127
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:12,597
Okay, $5. You give me.

1128
01:24:12,769 --> 01:24:15,101
-Okay, okay.
-All right.

1129
01:24:16,372 --> 01:24:17,737
Let's get mounted.

1130
01:24:23,147 --> 01:24:24,705
Something wrong there, chief?.

1131
01:24:24,882 --> 01:24:26,838
She says no boom-boom
with soul brother.

1132
01:24:27,017 --> 01:24:28,575
What the motherfuck?.

1133
01:24:28,752 --> 01:24:31,278
She says soul brother too beaucoup,
too beaucoup.

1134
01:24:31,456 --> 01:24:32,787
What is this, man?.

1135
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:38,021
I think what he's trying to tell you
is you black boys pack too much meat.

1136
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:41,727
Too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1137
01:24:41,901 --> 01:24:43,562
Oh, shit.

1138
01:24:43,736 --> 01:24:47,433
This baby-san looks like she could
suck the chrome off a trailer hitch.

1139
01:24:47,607 --> 01:24:50,668
She say too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1140
01:24:50,844 --> 01:24:52,766
EXcuse me, ma'am.

1141
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:55,471
What we have here, little yellow sister...

1142
01:24:55,649 --> 01:25:00,075
...is a magnificent specimen
of pure Alabama blacksnake.

1143
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,848
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

1144
01:25:03,892 --> 01:25:05,814
Okay, okay.

1145
01:25:06,528 --> 01:25:08,484
Okay, okay.

1146
01:25:09,832 --> 01:25:12,096
All right. Yeah. This is my boogie.

1147
01:25:12,268 --> 01:25:14,463
-Hey, we need a batting order.
-I'm going first.

1148
01:25:14,637 --> 01:25:18,027
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.

1149
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:21,507
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

1150
01:25:21,678 --> 01:25:24,806
-Hey, Animal, man.
-You son of a--

1151
01:25:24,981 --> 01:25:29,112
Hey, hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

1152
01:25:29,287 --> 01:25:31,585
-I don't want it after you, man.
-Fuck you.

1153
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:07,091
Intelligence passed the word down...

1154
01:26:07,262 --> 01:26:10,823
...that during the night
the NVA had pulled out of our area...

1155
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:13,957
...to positions across the Perfume River.

1156
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:18,527
Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.

1157
01:26:50,009 --> 01:26:52,773
Face outboard and take cover. Do it.

1158
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:07,784
Shit.

1159
01:27:16,371 --> 01:27:18,259
He ain't gonna make it.

1160
01:27:21,176 --> 01:27:22,804
Shit.

1161
01:27:29,319 --> 01:27:32,585
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1162
01:27:34,024 --> 01:27:37,516
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1163
01:27:38,395 --> 01:27:39,885
Hotel One. Over.

1164
01:27:40,064 --> 01:27:42,090
Murph, this is Cowboy.

1165
01:27:42,267 --> 01:27:45,600
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

1166
01:27:46,805 --> 01:27:48,500
Wait, One.

1167
01:27:49,674 --> 01:27:54,135
Okay. You're senior NCO, Cowboy.
You're in charge.

1168
01:27:54,447 --> 01:27:56,039
-Continue with the patrol...
-Shit.

1169
01:27:56,215 --> 01:27:58,513
-...and call in at the next checkpoint.
-Shit.

1170
01:27:58,684 --> 01:28:01,415
Roger. Out.

1171
01:28:07,828 --> 01:28:09,694
I ' m squad leader.

1172
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:15,089
Follow you anywhere, scumbag.

1173
01:28:16,204 --> 01:28:17,762
All right.

1174
01:28:18,573 --> 01:28:20,132
He's dead.

1175
01:29:01,254 --> 01:29:02,778
Cowboy.

1176
01:29:09,596 --> 01:29:10,858
What's up?.

1177
01:29:11,131 --> 01:29:14,362
I think we made a mistake
at the last checkpoint.

1178
01:29:14,535 --> 01:29:16,925
Here, see what you think.

1179
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:22,066
I think we're here...

1180
01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:25,535
...and we should be here.

1181
01:29:27,149 --> 01:29:29,276
-We're here?.
-Yeah.

1182
01:29:29,452 --> 01:29:32,717
-We should be here?.
-Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

1183
01:29:38,862 --> 01:29:40,591
Fuck.

1184
01:29:45,937 --> 01:29:47,564
What do you think?.

1185
01:29:49,207 --> 01:29:51,971
Well, I think we should change direction.

1186
01:30:05,925 --> 01:30:07,483
Okay.

1187
01:30:08,127 --> 01:30:10,152
We'll change direction.

1188
01:30:20,808 --> 01:30:22,367
What's up?.

1189
01:30:22,544 --> 01:30:24,466
Changing direction.

1190
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:26,408
What are we, lost?.

1191
01:30:26,581 --> 01:30:29,675
Joker, shut the fuck up.

1192
01:30:29,985 --> 01:30:32,113
Okay, listen up.

1193
01:30:32,288 --> 01:30:34,381
-Can you hear me?.
-Yeah.

1194
01:30:34,557 --> 01:30:36,388
Okay, we're changing direction.

1195
01:30:36,559 --> 01:30:38,288
We're heading over that way.

1196
01:30:38,461 --> 01:30:41,659
Eightball's gonna go over there
and see can he find a way through.

1197
01:30:42,165 --> 01:30:44,554
-Got it?.
-Got it.

1198
01:30:45,269 --> 01:30:48,261
Eightball, let's dance.

1199
01:30:48,839 --> 01:30:51,138
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

1200
01:31:52,242 --> 01:31:53,766
Fuck.

1201
01:32:09,495 --> 01:32:10,894
Cease fire.

1202
01:32:11,063 --> 01:32:12,951
Cease fire, goddamn it.

1203
01:32:13,132 --> 01:32:15,657
Cool it, goddamn it. Cool it. Cease fire.

1204
01:32:15,835 --> 01:32:17,360
-Hold it.
-Cease fire.

1205
01:32:17,537 --> 01:32:18,765
-Cease fire.
-Cease fire.

1206
01:32:18,939 --> 01:32:22,466
Okay, listen up. Did anybody see a sniper?.
Did anybody see anything?.

1207
01:32:22,643 --> 01:32:24,304
Anybody see a sniper?.

1208
01:32:24,478 --> 01:32:25,969
-Nothing.
-Negative.

1209
01:32:26,147 --> 01:32:30,038
Okay, then save your ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you.

1210
01:32:30,985 --> 01:32:32,145
Eightball.

1211
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,914
No, no. Cease fire. Cease fire.

1212
01:32:35,089 --> 01:32:36,785
Animal, cease fire.

1213
01:32:36,959 --> 01:32:39,086
Cowboy, it's Sergeant Murphy.

1214
01:32:39,261 --> 01:32:40,751
This is Cowboy. Over.

1215
01:32:40,896 --> 01:32:44,354
This is Murphy.
What is your present position? Over.

1216
01:32:44,533 --> 01:32:46,832
Murph, we're receiving enemy sniper fire.

1217
01:32:47,003 --> 01:32:48,265
Eightball is down.

1218
01:32:48,438 --> 01:32:51,327
Our position is about half a klick
north of Checkpoint Four.

1219
01:32:51,508 --> 01:32:55,206
Believe possible strong enemy forces
occupying buildings in front of us.

1220
01:32:55,379 --> 01:32:58,871
Request immediate tank support. Over.

1221
01:32:59,383 --> 01:33:00,782
Roger. Understand.

1222
01:33:00,951 --> 01:33:03,442
I'll see what I can do. Over.

1223
01:33:03,621 --> 01:33:05,988
Roger. Over and out.

1224
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:08,456
-Stay close.
-Got it.

1225
01:33:09,094 --> 01:33:13,121
Okay, listen up.
I think we're being set up for an ambush.

1226
01:33:13,299 --> 01:33:16,860
I think there may be strong enemy forces
in those buildings over there.

1227
01:33:17,036 --> 01:33:18,901
I've requested tank support.

1228
01:33:19,072 --> 01:33:22,337
We're gonna sit tight till it comes,
but keep your eyes open.

1229
01:33:22,508 --> 01:33:26,536
If they decide to hit us,
we'll have to pull back fast.

1230
01:33:27,581 --> 01:33:30,311
Goddamn it. Halt.
Cease your fire, Mother.

1231
01:33:30,484 --> 01:33:32,373
-Cease your fucking fire.
-Cowboy.

1232
01:33:32,554 --> 01:33:34,317
-What?.
-We can't leave him out there.

1233
01:33:34,489 --> 01:33:37,253
We're not leaving him,
we'll get him when the tank comes up.

1234
01:33:37,425 --> 01:33:40,087
He's hit three fucking times.
He can't wait that long.

1235
01:33:40,261 --> 01:33:42,287
I seen this before.

1236
01:33:42,465 --> 01:33:45,696
That sniper's just trying to suck us in,
one at a time.

1237
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:50,733
Goddamn it. No.

1238
01:33:50,906 --> 01:33:53,831
-Goddamn it, cease fire. Cease fire.
-Man, fuck this--

1239
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:56,103
Fuck this shit.
I'm going in to bring him out.

1240
01:33:56,279 --> 01:33:59,840
-No, you sit the fuck down, goddamn it.
-Cover me.

1241
01:34:15,768 --> 01:34:20,263
Cease fire, he's there.
Cease fire, he's there.

1242
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:22,704
Cease fire.

1243
01:34:34,088 --> 01:34:35,385
Hold your fire.

1244
01:34:35,556 --> 01:34:37,581
Hold your fire.

1245
01:34:37,758 --> 01:34:40,250
Cease fire, you can't see the sniper.

1246
01:34:40,428 --> 01:34:44,785
Save the ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you. Nobody.

1247
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:52,036
Hold your fire.

1248
01:34:52,742 --> 01:34:55,233
What the fuck do we do now, Cowboy?.

1249
01:34:56,479 --> 01:34:58,471
Give me that fucking radio.

1250
01:35:02,686 --> 01:35:05,280
Murph?. This is Cowboy. Over.

1251
01:35:05,455 --> 01:35:06,945
This is Murphy. Over.

1252
01:35:07,090 --> 01:35:09,457
Murph, we're in some deep shit.
I got two men down.

1253
01:35:09,661 --> 01:35:12,550
What's the story
on that fucking tank?. Over.

1254
01:35:13,631 --> 01:35:17,090
Sorry, Cowboy.
No luck so far with the tank.

1255
01:35:17,269 --> 01:35:19,533
Will advise. Over.

1256
01:35:20,539 --> 01:35:22,495
Roger. Out.

1257
01:35:22,908 --> 01:35:25,206
Numb-nut bastards.

1258
01:35:25,377 --> 01:35:28,472
-Okay, listen up.
-Listen up.

1259
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:31,408
Can't afford to wait for the tank.

1260
01:35:31,585 --> 01:35:33,507
I think they're gonna hit us any minute.

1261
01:35:33,687 --> 01:35:35,883
When they do,
we won't have time to pull out.

1262
01:35:36,057 --> 01:35:39,015
We gotta do it now.
Let's get ready to move.

1263
01:35:39,193 --> 01:35:41,457
-Ready to pull out.
-Wait a minute. Hold it.

1264
01:35:41,863 --> 01:35:45,652
Hold it, nobody's pulling out.
There's only one sniper there.

1265
01:35:45,834 --> 01:35:47,096
Back off, Mother.

1266
01:35:47,269 --> 01:35:50,227
I'm calling the plays.
I say we're pulling out.

1267
01:35:50,405 --> 01:35:52,202
Well, what about Doc Jay and Eightball?.

1268
01:35:52,374 --> 01:35:56,163
I know it's a shitty thing to do,
but we can't refuse to accept the situation.

1269
01:35:56,346 --> 01:35:58,610
We're not leaving
Doc Jay and Eightball out there.

1270
01:35:58,781 --> 01:36:00,612
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1271
01:36:00,783 --> 01:36:03,513
-You know that.
-Bullshit. Come on, you guys.

1272
01:36:03,686 --> 01:36:06,178
We gotta bring them back.
Let's get them, let's do it.

1273
01:36:06,323 --> 01:36:08,689
Stand down, Mother.
That's a direct order.

1274
01:36:12,897 --> 01:36:17,028
Fuck you, Cowboy.
Fuck all you assholes.

1275
01:36:19,137 --> 01:36:22,163
-Goddamn it.
-Fucking son of a bitch.

1276
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:25,037
You motherfucker.

1277
01:36:40,694 --> 01:36:43,425
Doc. Doc. Doc.

1278
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:47,188
Where's the sniper?.

1279
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:53,335
Doc, where's the sniper?.

1280
01:37:02,052 --> 01:37:03,781
Shit.

1281
01:37:05,388 --> 01:37:07,913
Shit. Fuck.

1282
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,832
Fuck.

1283
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:57,637
Hey, Cowboy.

1284
01:37:57,979 --> 01:37:59,743
Yeah?.

1285
01:38:00,616 --> 01:38:04,108
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1286
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:08,213
There's only one sniper, nothing else.

1287
01:38:08,592 --> 01:38:12,449
Move up the squad,
you're clear up to here.

1288
01:38:13,296 --> 01:38:14,786
Come on.

1289
01:38:17,402 --> 01:38:19,597
Son of a bitch.

1290
01:38:23,374 --> 01:38:25,934
-Okay, listen up.
-Listen up.

1291
01:38:26,979 --> 01:38:31,211
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock,
you come with me, we'll take a look.

1292
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:34,039
The rest of you all stay put
and cover our ass.

1293
01:38:34,219 --> 01:38:37,018
We may be coming back in a big hurry.

1294
01:38:37,891 --> 01:38:40,223
-I'm going with you.
-I'm coming too.

1295
01:38:40,393 --> 01:38:42,224
Okay.

1296
01:38:42,395 --> 01:38:44,056
-You all set?.
-Yeah.

1297
01:38:44,230 --> 01:38:45,254
Let's move out.

1298
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:46,691
Let's do it.

1299
01:39:24,909 --> 01:39:26,240
Hey, Cowboy.

1300
01:39:26,411 --> 01:39:28,902
Top of the black building,
around the corner.

1301
01:39:48,668 --> 01:39:51,364
Donlon, give me that radio.

1302
01:39:53,908 --> 01:39:55,637
Murphy, this is Cowboy. Over.

1303
01:40:06,155 --> 01:40:08,544
-Cowboy.
-Holy shit. That sniper's got a clean shot.

1304
01:40:08,724 --> 01:40:10,612
Get him the fuck out of here.

1305
01:40:17,333 --> 01:40:20,029
-I ain't got a first aid.
-I don't believe this shit.

1306
01:40:20,203 --> 01:40:22,331
-Give me your hand.
-Shut up.

1307
01:40:22,506 --> 01:40:24,098
-Take it easy, Cowboy.
-Don't move.

1308
01:40:24,275 --> 01:40:25,572
-Shit.
-That son of a bitch.

1309
01:40:25,743 --> 01:40:27,608
-You'll be all right.
-You're going home.

1310
01:40:27,778 --> 01:40:30,612
-Shut up.
-Don't shit me.

1311
01:40:30,782 --> 01:40:34,411
You know I'm not gonna shit you, man.
You're my favorite turd.

1312
01:40:35,053 --> 01:40:36,247
Come on. Easy.

1313
01:40:36,655 --> 01:40:37,781
Here you go.

1314
01:40:39,491 --> 01:40:43,383
-Cowboy.
-Hang on, man. Hang on.

1315
01:40:47,233 --> 01:40:50,260
I can hack it. I can hack it.

1316
01:40:56,343 --> 01:40:59,768
-I can hack it.
-You can hack it, man.

1317
01:41:55,843 --> 01:41:58,403
Let's go get some payback.

1318
01:42:04,318 --> 01:42:05,911
Okay.

1319
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:13,789
Okay.

1320
01:42:21,237 --> 01:42:23,330
Watch that fucking hole.

1321
01:42:24,608 --> 01:42:25,836
Throw some smoke.

1322
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:44,158
Okay, ready?.

1323
01:43:25,174 --> 01:43:28,905
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.

1324
01:43:33,984 --> 01:43:36,646
Joker, in there. New guy.

1325
01:45:40,657 --> 01:45:43,581
We got the sniper.

1326
01:46:17,298 --> 01:46:18,822
Joker?.

1327
01:46:19,366 --> 01:46:20,856
Yo.

1328
01:46:21,201 --> 01:46:22,760
What's up?.

1329
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:26,400
We got the sniper.

1330
01:46:38,955 --> 01:46:40,912
I saved Joker's ass.

1331
01:46:41,091 --> 01:46:42,888
I got the sniper.

1332
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:45,722
I fucking blew her away.

1333
01:46:46,563 --> 01:46:48,519
Am I bad?.

1334
01:46:49,132 --> 01:46:53,126
Am I a life-taker?. Am I a heartbreaker?.

1335
01:47:10,690 --> 01:47:12,851
What's she saying?.

1336
01:47:16,496 --> 01:47:18,327
She's praying.

1337
01:47:22,203 --> 01:47:25,502
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.

1338
01:47:28,409 --> 01:47:30,833
There's nothing we can do for her.

1339
01:47:32,414 --> 01:47:34,507
She's dead meat.

1340
01:47:38,988 --> 01:47:40,421
Okay.

1341
01:47:41,724 --> 01:47:43,885
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1342
01:47:48,399 --> 01:47:50,264
What about her?.

1343
01:47:54,038 --> 01:47:55,699
Fuck her.

1344
01:47:57,042 --> 01:47:58,737
Let her rot.

1345
01:48:15,061 --> 01:48:17,394
We can't just leave her here.

1346
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,488
Hey, asshole.

1347
01:48:22,969 --> 01:48:25,199
Cowboy's wasted.

1348
01:48:25,673 --> 01:48:28,233
You're fresh out of friends.

1349
01:48:29,343 --> 01:48:31,174
I'm running this squad now...

1350
01:48:31,345 --> 01:48:35,612
...and I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

1351
01:48:39,455 --> 01:48:42,515
I'm not trying to run this squad.

1352
01:48:44,359 --> 01:48:48,319
I'm just saying
we can't leave her like this.

1353
01:48:57,842 --> 01:49:00,800
Shoot me.

1354
01:49:02,747 --> 01:49:04,773
Shoot...

1355
01:49:05,283 --> 01:49:06,875
...me.

1356
01:49:07,452 --> 01:49:09,545
Shoot...

1357
01:49:10,055 --> 01:49:11,647
...me.

1358
01:49:12,124 --> 01:49:14,116
Shoot.

1359
01:49:15,795 --> 01:49:17,490
Shoot.

1360
01:49:18,698 --> 01:49:21,997
If you wanna waste her, go on...

1361
01:49:23,871 --> 01:49:25,964
...waste her.

1362
01:49:26,140 --> 01:49:27,767
Shoot...

1363
01:49:29,943 --> 01:49:31,376
...me.

1364
01:49:35,483 --> 01:49:38,247
Shoot me.

1365
01:49:40,188 --> 01:49:41,416
Shoot...

1366
01:49:42,691 --> 01:49:44,420
...me.

1367
01:49:44,794 --> 01:49:46,887
Shoot...

1368
01:49:47,596 --> 01:49:49,029
...me.

1369
01:49:49,632 --> 01:49:51,828
Shoot.

1370
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:55,495
Shoot.

1371
01:49:59,142 --> 01:50:00,667
Shoot.

1372
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:03,271
Shoot.

1373
01:50:40,589 --> 01:50:42,420
Joker...

1374
01:50:42,591 --> 01:50:47,346
...we're gonna have to put you up
for the Congressional Medal of Ugly.

1375
01:50:51,133 --> 01:50:53,260
Hard-core, man.

1376
01:50:55,271 --> 01:50:57,797
Fucking hard-core.

1377
01:51:14,792 --> 01:51:19,856
We have nailed our names
in the pages of history enough for today.

1378
01:51:20,466 --> 01:51:25,130
We hump down to the Perfume River
to set in for the night.

1379
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:07,879
My thoughts drift back
to erect-nipple wet dreams...

1380
01:52:08,052 --> 01:52:14,185
...about Mary Jane Rottencrotch
and the great homecoming-fuck fantasy.

1381
01:52:14,826 --> 01:52:17,522
I am so happy that I am alive...

1382
01:52:17,696 --> 01:52:21,223
...in one piece and short.

1383
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:25,200
I am in a world of shit, yes...

1384
01:52:25,371 --> 01:52:27,327
...but I am alive.

1385
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:29,731
And I am not afraid.
