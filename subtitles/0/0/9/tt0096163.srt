{2582}{2618}Let's get off the highway...
{2642}{2726}see some local color.
{2750}{2865}Only if you drive.
{3946}{3965}What is it?
{3984}{4037}I'm just looking at the gas meter.
{4039}{4085}Just look in your mirror.
{4191}{4296}If you sat behind the wheel,|you'd see the meter better.
{4368}{4390}Look!
{4406}{4442}There's one tree.
{4473}{4500}A tree.
{4536}{4639}Unbelievable!|Another one tree.
{4804}{4859}Peel an orange for me.
{5396}{5454}Well, so much for your|"Local color."
{5615}{5691}My nightmare.|I had it again last night.
{5703}{5792}That you're inside a golden egg|and you can't get out,
{5806}{5878}and you float all alone|through space forever.
{5914}{5986}Yes, the loneliness is unbearable.
{6073}{6178}No. This time there was another|golden egg flying through space.
{6212}{6363}And if we were to collide,|it'd all be over.
{6483}{6519}Rex, what's that?
{6670}{6727}- Gasoline.|- No, no, no!
{6737}{6794}Take it easy.|I know it's my fault.
{6806}{6852}This is really dangerous.
{6977}{7039}- Calm down.|- Is the warning light on?
{7041}{7106}There's no warning light in this car.
{7120}{7195}See what happens when|you don't listen to me?
{7199}{7250}Don't panic, dammit!
{7250}{7336}What got us here doesn't matter.|We just have to get out.
{7336}{7396}- And if you get hysterical...|- I'm not hysterical!
{7444}{7475}I'm scared.
{7588}{7626}The golden egg...
{7689}{7749}This is no time to talk|about dreams.
{7761}{7794}We have to get out of here.|C'mon!
{7799}{7849}Nobody can see us.|We're gonna be run over.
{7852}{7888}The flashlight! I brought one.
{7895}{7955}- What flashlight?|- I packed one.
{7957}{8024}Christ! A car's gonna plow|over us any minute!
{8029}{8072}I have to find the flashlight.
{8077}{8103}C'mon, godammit!
{8127}{8173}Don't touch me! You go.
{8185}{8247}Saskia, you won't find|the flashlight in this mess.
{8254}{8276}I'm going.
{8310}{8372}Rex wait! I'll find it!
{8463}{8509}Rex, don't leave me here alone!
{8813}{8866}You can't leave me here alone!
{9101}{9142}Rex, wait!
{12033}{12067}That way.
{13512}{13591}...one has only to be better|than his opponent...
{13625}{13733}- Good day, sir. What'll it be?|- Fill it up, please. And this too.
{14162}{14224}If you want, we can go back|to Amsterdam.
{14383}{14435}I'm sorry about earlier.
{14471}{14524}I didn't know what to do.
{14548}{14610}Still, I shouldn't have left you alone.
{14675}{14750}- I also have gas in the bidon.|- What?
{14776}{14802}The jerry can.
{14915}{14951}I love you.
{15032}{15068}In the tunnel,
{15068}{15140}when you called for me,|I felt I loved you more than ever.
{15143}{15169}I hated you.
{15411}{15462}We're going to have|a wonderful holiday,
{15476}{15531}together in my little house.
{15538}{15570}Well, what are we waiting for?
{15572}{15615}I have to go to the ladies' room first.
{15617}{15661}Okay, I'll wait for you over there.
{15759}{15864}...and here comes the bunch|with Delgado, Bernaudeau...
{15869}{15951}...and Hinault in front...
{15965}{16027}Here you go. 300 francs, please.
{16102}{16155}- Here.|- Thanks.
{16190}{16217}Move on, please.
{16490}{16531}Rex, catch!
{16682}{16773}A frisbee for 13.50 francs?|What on earth for?
{16773}{16879}You've been driving all this time.|It's good for stiffness.
{16967}{17075}From the girl who loves roses.|Especially when they come in 8!
{17121}{17195}- But I don't smoke.|- You can give me a light!
{17420}{17447}What did I do?
{17634}{17684}May I still go on vacation?
{17773}{17811}Two conditions.
{17828}{17859}And they are...?
{17888}{17946}That I drive to Bois Vieux.
{18128}{18228}You'd give a key ring this ugly|to a lovely lady like me?
{18231}{18286}Yes, yes, yes.|And the second condition?
{18291}{18315}Counting trees.
{18317}{18368}5... 6... 7... 8...
{18370}{18456}Fignon is climbing|in a very fluid style...
{18459}{18526}Fignon, yes, Fignon is engaging|Herrera and Dietzen.
{18531}{18605}He's flanking Hinault. Fignon's|climbing very smoothly...
{18610}{18658}...and we're right there with him.
{18660}{18720}Hinault's been left behind...
{18722}{18792}Now he's paying for his repeated|attacks all the way up.
{18797}{18864}Fignon... uh, Fignon... pardon...
{18866}{18941}masters the situation|with supreme confidence...
{18943}{19017}Hinault's gained distance...|I'm tripping over my words...
{19020}{19058}he's leading... Fantastic!
{19063}{19137}Hinault, Fignon, Herrera,|Dietzen... in the rear Millar.
{19142}{19214}Hinault's suffering,|but his champion of Brittany
{19216}{19274}has life in him yet.
{19279}{19310}It's anybody's game.
{19312}{19365}An important chapter|in the history of the Tour...
{19367}{19415}is unfolding before our eyes.
{19442}{19511}I, me, Rex Hofman
{19526}{19569}I, Rex Hofman...
{19607}{19686}swear that the wonderful...
{19727}{19804}swear the wonderful...
{19816}{19854}exquisite and sweet...
{19871}{19924}exquisite and...
{19969}{20012}almost always sweet...
{20019}{20082}the always sweet Saskia Wagter...
{20096}{20144}the always sweet Saskia Wagter...
{20175}{20238}will never be abandoned by me.
{20278}{20336}will never be abandoned by me.
{20722}{20808}I'll keep them.|So I can get used to them.
{20859}{20883}Stop exaggerating.
{20916}{20990}Let's grab something to drink,|then I'll drive to Bois Vieux.
{20998}{21046}Want me to go and buy something?
{21046}{21086}No, it's on me.
{21089}{21163}- Want a beer?|- Sounds good. Got any money?
{21297}{21405}I'm exaggerating again.|Who on earth has to get used to car keys?
{22089}{22165}- Have a good trip, you guys.|- Thanks. Same to you.
{22175}{22194}Thanks.
{22386}{22405}Bye.
{23618}{23724}CAR GETTING USED TO SASKIA
{24016}{24134}...Hinault's really suffering.|He's been passed by Herrera,
{24136}{24218}who's finished this last|ascent in the lead,
{24220}{24270}and by Fignon who's on his|way to winning
{24275}{24323}the yellow jersey of the Tour,|1984...
{24328}{24381}Fignon, who's just caught up|with Hinault...
{24383}{24424}has now overtaken him|in the final stretch!
{26107}{26280}SASKIA, I'M LOOKING FOR YOU.|WAIT IN THE CAR.
{26809}{26845}- Saskia!|- Get out of the way!
{26865}{26915}- I'm looking for my wife.|- You can't stand here.
{27263}{27306}Sir, that's not the men's room.
{27469}{27495}Saskia!
{27603}{27675}- I can't find my wife.|- This isn't the ladies' room.
{28143}{28207}Sir, customers aren't allowed here.
{28255}{28310}Miss. Excuse me. Miss?
{28332}{28356}I'm looking for my wife.
{28370}{28425}She came to buy a beer|and a Coke.
{28442}{28502}She's got reddish hair|with little...
{28557}{28639}She's wearing white jeans|and a yellow jersey.
{28641}{28677}Fignon has the yellow jersey.
{28711}{28752}You mean a yellow top.
{28759}{28797}Yeah, with gold thread.
{28802}{28831}Wait, I've got a photo.
{28898}{28946}Here you go.
{28982}{29030}- Yeah, I've seen her.|- When?
{29030}{29070}About... half an hour ago.
{29073}{29118}She was by the coffee machine.
{29121}{29183}The coffee machine? But...
{29185}{29238}she wanted something cold.
{29265}{29351}She was by the coffee machine|and came over to get change.
{29353}{29420}But was she alone|or talking to somebody?
{29423}{29497}You know how many folks come|through here everyday? 10,000.
{29497}{29545}And they're all strangers.
{29548}{29610}Excuse me,|have you seen this woman?
{29663}{29759}Yes, I saw her leaving|with a man a few minutes ago.
{29787}{29864}- Minutes?|- About 1 5 minutes ago.
{29866}{29941}Your girl was leaving the shop|with a drink in each hand.
{29950}{29977}A Coke and a beer.
{30020}{30053}Was she alone or with someone?
{30073}{30113}All alone... I think... I dunno.
{30169}{30257}- And then?|- Then I did an oil change...
{30260}{30320}But where'd you see her last?
{30341}{30394}At that door, over there.
{30545}{30641}If she was here with the cans,|then she was on her way back.
{30653}{30686}So, she must have seen me.
{30734}{30792}Which means I could also see her.
{30809}{30833}The Polaroid!
{30873}{30931}Look! Here she is.
{31010}{31041}Here, the little red dot.
{31051}{31159}See? It's her.|It can't be anyone else.
{31168}{31257}And there's somebody here,|beside her.
{31264}{31291}We've got to find him.
{31310}{31353}A cyclist isn't just a pair of legs...
{31355}{31406}He's got a head...|You've gotta be able to think...
{31408}{31434}The bikes!
{31444}{31511}Yes, this Jean-Paul Brouchon says:|It's a duel between 2 men...
{32202}{32226}Dad!
{32501}{32588}We're tempted to say, at the end|of this 17th day of the Tour...
{32590}{32698}Mr. Hofman, believe me,|I'm taking you seriously.
{32760}{32827}You know very well that|you didn't fight with your wife,
{32827}{32890}but how do you expect|the police to know that?
{32904}{32947}She's disappeared, right?
{32959}{33007}Your wife's only been gone|a few hours.
{33014}{33070}To them, it's just|a domestic quarrel.
{33084}{33177}Imagine if they had to investigate|every time...
{33180}{33230}If she's not back by 8:00 a.m.|tomorrow,
{33233}{33281}you can get them to open a case.
{33281}{33317}Tomorrow morning's too late.
{33333}{33391}We have to do something now!
{33400}{33460}She might have been kidnapped.
{33482}{33537}He must've left a clue somewhere.
{33549}{33573}Listen, in the morning I'll...
{33575}{33674}You listen! We don't have to wait|for the police.
{33705}{33801}She was by the coffee machine,|she was talking to someone.
{33842}{33916}If he got coffee,
{33933}{33993}he must have left his prints|on a coin.
{34017}{34105}We have to keep an eye on all that|change 'til the police get here.
{34276}{34302}You can't be serious!
{34343}{34364}That's absurd.
{34395}{34451}- Tomorrow morning...|- Sir...
{36184}{36273}HOUSE FOR SALE
{36829}{36889}Careful! That doesn't look|very steady.
{37205}{37251}I'm not surprised,|this is an old dump.
{37251}{37325}Denise, you're unbelievable!|lf your grandma heard you...
{37508}{37599}As a reward for your patience with me,|look what I've brought.
{37608}{37697}Ah... Gaby, get the corkscrew|from the drawer, please.
{37858}{37879}Spiders!
{37901}{37949}Such adorable, lovable animals.|And so useful too.
{37956}{38006}That was a really beautiful scream!|Let's hear it again.
{38011}{38033}I can do it louder.
{38342}{38366}And mommy?
{38649}{38706}How's the house coming along?
{38730}{38754}We're doing our best.
{38759}{38838}Why don't you cut more trees down?|You'll get more sunlight.
{38841}{38877}And thieves too.
{38889}{38958}When one has a beautiful house,|it's never for oneself alone.
{38968}{39052}Tell me, Mr. Laurent, I was here|yesterday with my wife and kids...
{39056}{39109}- I'm not sure if you noticed...?|- No.
{39116}{39176}Because as we drove up,|we thought we heard screams
{39179}{39207}coming from my place.
{39224}{39311}- Did you hear anything?|- No, not a thing.
{39929}{39979}- You going to Nmes?|- Yes.
{39982}{40006}Louis!
{40023}{40049}I'm with a friend.
{40090}{40111}Yes, I see.
{40126}{40181}Listen, you're scam artists.|I'm not.
{40183}{40248}There's space for two,|but I stopped for her and her alone.
{40262}{40296}So, see ya!
{42917}{42950}I'll do it in the blink of an eye.
{43099}{43120}Let's see...
{43125}{43209}12cc is equal to...
{43257}{43286}How much do I have...?
{43341}{43449}Yes, 18 minutes, 54 seconds.
{43502}{43552}18 minutes, 54 seconds|is equal to...
{43600}{43655}17 miles, more or less.
{43696}{43825}That leaves me a margin|of 3 or 4 minutes.
{43837}{43868}That's not bad.
{43948}{43976}Not bad.
{44909}{44931}Good day, madam.
{45000}{45110}What a coincidence!
{45132}{45173}You may as well get in my car.
{45420}{45463}Handkerchief...
{45650}{45681}It's a little small...
{45765}{45839}Madam. Yes, like this.
{46024}{46074}Well. I'll start over.
{46304}{46331}What a coincidence!
{46355}{46393}You may as well get in my car.
{46419}{46441}Good.
{46547}{46573}There!
{46753}{46777}And here!
{46928}{46956}Excuse me.
{48438}{48477}Why'd you do that?
{48484}{48534}Because I love you. See?
{48537}{48582}No, I mean the lock.
{48611}{48656}Didn't you read about|that girl in the paper?
{48656}{48714}She fell out of a car|on the highway recently.
{48728}{48771}That's terrible! ls she dead?
{48781}{48815}Come now, think about it.
{48815}{48899}The tar, cars traveling|at high speeds...
{48901}{48937}Of course she's dead.
{49064}{49114}Daddy, do you have a mistress?
{49146}{49179}Don't be so shocked.
{49179}{49227}At your age you're allowed to, right?
{49253}{49323}At the house at St. Cme.|I'm not dumb.
{49862}{49944}Excuse me.|The Prisunic drug store...?
{49946}{50021}The Prisunic? What a coincidence,|I'm heading there myself.
{50021}{50052}I can take you;
{50107}{50148}make the best of your luck!
{50176}{50224}Yes, but...|I think I'd rather walk.
{50260}{50320}You're right.|It's a beautiful day.
{50344}{50390}So... the Prisunic...|go down the avenue,
{50397}{50459}and to your right.|It's in front of the square.
{50903}{50953}3:42 p.m.
{50992}{51037}Pulse rate: 90.
{51080}{51133}The euphoria of victory|in this royal display...
{51138}{51258}Zoetemelk at 76 and 79,|Kuilper at 77 and 78,
{51260}{51366}Winnen at 81 and 83 to carry on|the Dutch tradition.
{51881}{51970}- Is there someone else?|- No.
{52147}{52214}WILL FIGNON SCORE THE YELLOW?
{52277}{52334}Don't you want to know|why I asked?
{52423}{52531}If it wasn't me who was going there,|I'd see it the same way.
{52531}{52620}All the time I seem to spend at St. Cme,|all the mileage I do...
{52620}{52660}But Simone, I love you.
{52684}{52728}And I love our two daughters.
{52797}{52912}And without a doubt,|I'm the last Frenchman who can be proud
{52917}{52996}of having known|only one woman in his life.
{53224}{53269}It's the mileage.
{53277}{53392}It's 8 miles from here to the house.|16 roundtrip.
{53392}{53495}Lately, you've been averaging|31 miles a day.
{53504}{53574}I used to dream of having|a wife who loved numbers.
{53574}{53612}Well, here she is.
{53617}{53641}Denise.
{53655}{53706}Denise. Go to your room.
{53770}{53838}The house at St. Cme|is like a passion.
{53938}{54017}Because it's perfect,|it has become a passion.
{54034}{54085}You start with an idea|in your head.
{54123}{54209}And you take a step...|then a second...
{54248}{54341}Soon, you realize you're up to|your neck in something intense,
{54377}{54415}but that doesn't matter.
{54435}{54519}You keep at it for the sheer|pleasure of it.
{54523}{54590}For the pure satisfaction|it might bring you.
{54684}{54761}And that, my dear...|that can't be measured in miles.
{54823}{54936}Today, the 140 survivors of the|Tour enter their final week...
{54941}{54996}Excuse me, madam,|I'm looking for the Prisunic...?
{54996}{55029}You going by car?
{55048}{55120}Aren't you Mr. Lemorne|from Nmes?
{55156}{55199}Don't you recognize me?
{55216}{55259}Gisle Marzin.
{55274}{55367}I know your daughter Gabrielle very well.|I was her volleyball coach.
{55372}{55403}Oh, yes... of course.
{55410}{55461}We often met at the games.
{55463}{55518}Do you come to Remoulins a lot?
{55533}{55571}I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.
{55571}{55578}I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.
{55595}{55660}We could have a quick coffee.|Just for 5 minutes.
{55662}{55705}No, I really am in a rush.
{55722}{55765}Mr. Lemorne...
{55765}{55804}the Prisunic...
{55811}{55907}Take the highway in any direction.|I was just there. It's full of foreigners.
{55907}{56031}Stop at any gas station,|you'll find hundreds of women,
{56036}{56099}and there's no danger|of being recognized.
{56135}{56194}It's Laurent Fignon in the lead.
{56197}{56252}He's become the favorite...
{57324}{57379}very demanding... the best, surely.
{57391}{57463}The Fignon/Hinault duel is|getting more intense...
{57468}{57549}...in fact, on this day, it's|not a question of finesse...
{58156}{58189}She's never there.
{58199}{58264}I'll see her mother next week.
{58266}{58350}THIS YOUNG WOMAN DISAPPEARED|3 YEARS AGO
{58774}{58822}That guy and his posters again.
{58822}{58849}What guy?
{58870}{58935}Try to remember.|We've already argued about this.
{58935}{58966}We argue about everything...
{58966}{59057}At Martinez's, you wanted to crucify|anyone who kidnapped young girls.
{59057}{59110}I even asked, "What if I'd done it?"|You laughed in my face!
{59112}{59148}Ah yes, the Dutch girl.|And so?
{59148}{59232}Nothing. I admire his perseverance.
{59261}{59323}You mean his obsession. 3 years...
{59331}{59402}Exactly. I don't get it.|He's some guy.
{60263}{60290}Good glue, isn't it?
{60316}{60349}Yeah, it's a good glue.
{60450}{60510}Sometimes I imagine she's alive.
{60541}{60608}Somewhere far away.|She's very happy.
{60649}{60700}And then, I have to make a choice.
{60726}{60855}Either I let her go on living|and never know,
{60884}{60987}or I let her die and|find out what happened.
{61090}{61138}So... I let her die.
{61167}{61241}I don't feel like being|part of a mnage  trois.
{61474}{61496}Sir?
{61522}{61565}Good morning, sir.|A Perrier, please.
{61570}{61601}A Perrier, sure.
{61603}{61642}Excuse me, sir.
{61656}{61752}- You know a Montmejean?|- Yeah: me.
{61771}{61834}- What?|- I'm Mr. Montmejean.
{61908}{61977}- Ah, all right... Thank you.|- A Perrier.
{61982}{62049}I want to see you.|September 13th. 3:00 p.m.
{62049}{62097}Caf Des Beaux Arts, Nmes.
{62105}{62131}Montmejean.
{63713}{63776}He's watching me. I can feel it.
{63848}{63888}I think he's a lunatic.
{63896}{63996}If he's really involved,|he wouldn't put himself in such danger.
{64054}{64131}This is the fifth time|he's made me run after him,
{64147}{64231}and it's always within 62 miles|of that gas station.
{64286}{64327}He's building up courage.
{64375}{64473}He knows I could've seen him then,|and that I might recognize him now.
{64490}{64512}And then?
{64658}{64680}No idea.
{64763}{64809}Know what I'm afraid of?
{64838}{64910}That he'll stop sending postcards.
{64955}{64989}What if he's dead?
{65006}{65056}Then I'll never know.
{65245}{65284}You won't ever know.
{65308}{65399}He's playing with you.|He's followed the story through the papers,
{65404}{65466}and wants to see how far you'll go.
{65502}{65574}He just needs to send a postcard|and you obey him.
{65610}{65648}He's having a blast.
{65694}{65715}We'll see.
{66133}{66166}Quarter to four.
{66245}{66281}Shall we go?
{66322}{66358}Let him go to hell.
{66360}{66483}- He's here. Saskia was...|- Saskia's gone, Rex. She's gone.
{66485}{66590}Show this nutcase, or whatever he is,|that you're not interested anymore.
{66595}{66650}And if you want to do something|meaningful in your life,
{66653}{66725}come lie with me in the sun.|And do nothing.
{66873}{66962}If Saskia were here now,|I'd still go with you.
{66976}{67027}But if it were possible|to really choose,
{67027}{67116}I'd rather be at that gas station...|3 years ago.
{67890}{67912}Lieneke!
{68693}{68727}Where do you want to go?
{68772}{68830}To Anduze, Bois Vieux.
{68883}{68940}I've never been there.
{68940}{68983}Then it's time you went.
{69048}{69115}I've had enough of your|"sacred places."
{69803}{69858}There might be people up there.
{71376}{71482}Crocodile... chameleon...|caterpillar...
{71496}{71518}Here we are.
{73663}{73783}Golden egg... golden egg...
{73858}{73894}What egg?
{74059}{74124}Saskia! Saskia!
{75133}{75212}Come on! Come on!
{75270}{75291}Here I am!
{75315}{75342}Rex Hofman!
{75356}{75414}Come on!
{75454}{75493}Come and show yourself.
{75526}{75560}Hey, piss off, man!
{75581}{75627}Come and show yourself!
{75641}{75687}What's all this crap about?
{75723}{75756}You finished, you prick?
{75764}{75804}Yes! I'm here, Rex Hofman!
{75828}{75898}Don't you get it?|Do I have to come down there?
{75905}{75958}Come and show yourself!
{75975}{76044}Last equation: benzoic acid...
{76111}{76159}plus NH2...
{76255}{76282}H20...
{76327}{76358}30 seconds.
{76512}{76545}Mr. Lemorne.
{76620}{76639}15.
{76826}{76859}Mr. Lemorne.
{76879}{76903}5.
{77013}{77051}Finish.
{77128}{77221}- Where are you standing?|- Next to the fountain.
{77262}{77404}In this crowded square in Arles,|there might be a murderer.
{77416}{77476}You might see him,|but you won't realize it.
{77476}{77535}He's just another face|in the crowd.
{77550}{77663}A gripping situation|which Mr. Hofman
{77665}{77713}has experienced 5 times.
{77715}{77754}Daddy, look! There we are!
{77758}{77850}-How many times did the police videotape it?|-Didn't you see?
{77854}{77888}Only the first 2 times.
{77917}{78015}Now they're convinced|it's just a bad joke.
{78029}{78073}And you don't agree, right?
{78109}{78195}No. And I hope this gentleman|is listening.
{78219}{78279}There's something|I want to tell him.
{78317}{78365}I want to meet you.
{78394}{78466}I want to know what happened|to my friend.
{78490}{78566}To know that,|I'm prepared to do anything.
{78598}{78631}I don't hate you.
{78648}{78715}I don't hate anything.|But I need to know.
{78761}{78794}I need to know.
{80686}{80705}I'm sorry.
{80827}{80878}I hope you'll eventually|learn something.
{81031}{81089}She's working in a brothel|in Marseilles.
{81269}{81405}I'll see her in 3 days.|Mrs. Phoenix, Montelimar.
{82009}{82096}- Take a look?|- Okay.
{82611}{82757}In this crowded square in Arles,|there might be a murderer.
{82765}{82815}You might see him,|but you won't realize it.
{82827}{82889}He's just another face|in the crowd.
{82899}{83002}A gripping situation|which Mr. Hofman
{83007}{83052}has experienced 5 times.
{83182}{83218}I need to know.
{83254}{83338}Do you have any idea what|kind of person he could be?
{83376}{83400}I think...
{83431}{83496}no, I'm sure... he's...
{83520}{83577}he's very intelligent,
{83585}{83645}can go unnoticed,
{83676}{83736}and is a total perfectionist.
{83752}{83820}Mr. Hofman, an important question:
{83863}{83973}this new campaign must cost|at least 100,000 guilders.
{83987}{84093}That means you've had to borrow|about 300,000 francs.
{84103}{84172}Why now? After 3 years?
{84186}{84268}Not long ago, I had a dream.
{84273}{84424}The exact same dream my friend had|the night before she disappeared.
{84465}{84501}She dreamed
{84532}{84656}that we'd meet somewhere in space,
{84673}{84712}each of us
{84712}{84764}imprisoned inside a golden egg.
{84822}{84963}In my dream we also found each other,|out there in space.
{85021}{85090}And I've interpreted this dream|as a sign.
{85112}{85157}Do you have any hope...
{85169}{85234}Of finding her? No!
{85261}{85328}Then, Mr. Hofman, why|don't you give up?
{85371}{85424}It's an homage, sir.
{85467}{85493}Nice.
{85505}{85603}An homage to the vanished loved one.
{85603}{85678}If you have any information|about this young woman,
{85687}{85728}please contact us.
{85742}{85783}Thank you, Mr. Hofman.
{86126}{86172}You're quite photogenic.
{86464}{86483}I'm sorry.
{86541}{86579}How are you?
{86606}{86644}Okay.
{86656}{86690}Really?
{86805}{86862}Don't you know "Lieneke's Law"?
{86877}{86939}Relationship Law #1 :
{87018}{87140}"Getting over the separation lasts|half the time the relationship did."
{87143}{87217}So I'll be over it in about 4 months.
{87373}{87411}It's a pity.
{87459}{87517}If there'd been no Saskia...
{87521}{87622}True, if there'd been no Saskia.|But there was and is a Saskia.
{87649}{87687}Understand that.
{87943}{87982}I'll call you.
{90571}{90607}Mr. Hofman.
{90662}{90708}I'm the man you're looking for.
{90804}{90857}Caf des Beaux Arts, in Nmes.
{90861}{90945}I saw you, but you weren't alone,|so I didn't dare bother you.
{91053}{91106}Is she de... dead?
{91111}{91166}Come with me to France|and you'll know everything.
{91166}{91271}- Even how she died?|- I offer you this unique chance.
{92082}{92101}Finished?
{92372}{92427}I'm warning you,|I've taken precautions.
{92458}{92525}If anything happens to me,|if you speak to anyone,
{92528}{92602}my offer's no longer valid.|And you won't know a thing!
{92602}{92657}I'm going back to France|with or without you.
{92660}{92705}I'm off in 5 minutes.
{93444}{93515}All this time,|I was afraid you might be dead.
{94326}{94379}If you're hungry,|I've prepared everything.
{94796}{94849}Passport. Passport.
{95079}{95163}If they don't stop us,|I promise I'll tell you everything.
{95712}{95736}Go on.
{95978}{96019}Lemorne, Raymond.
{96031}{96076}6 Place aux Herbes, Nmes.
{96114}{96218}Last time you made me go to your place.
{96335}{96409}True, I don't like the idea|that you know my name.
{96412}{96462}I have to limit my risks.
{96465}{96539}But you could have traced it|from my license plate.
{96592}{96644}You won't gain anything by|opening an investigation.
{96644}{96695}You have nothing on me.
{96707}{96824}The coins in the coffee machine.|Your prints are on them.
{96851}{96927}If I'd been thirsty, and if I had coffee,
{96930}{96994}I'd have held the coins by the edge.
{97040}{97167}You're on a Polaroid I took|at the gas station!
{97177}{97203}That's a lie.
{97205}{97287}You would have recognized me at|the caf in Nmes. I was there.
{97371}{97426}Second table on the right.
{97529}{97553}Passport.
{97944}{98028}I've thought a lot about|our meeting, Mr. Hofman.
{98028}{98102}Since the beginning,|I felt the need to see you.
{98104}{98157}When you left the caf,
{98160}{98210}I realized I couldn't wait any longer.
{98246}{98306}What you said on television pursuaded me.
{98306}{98371}I gathered the courage you spoke of.
{98426}{98474}You can kill me.
{98502}{98553}I acknowledge your right to do so.
{98553}{98586}I'll take the risk.
{98632}{98704}But I'm banking on your curiosity.
{98723}{98800}You want to know what|happened to Miss Saskia.
{99231}{99296}When I was 16,|I discovered something.
{100835}{100902}Everyone has those thoughts,|but no one ever jumps.
{100941}{101006}I told myself:|"Imagine you're jumping."
{101039}{101101}Is it predestined that I won't jump?
{101121}{101176}How can it be predestined|that I won't?
{101207}{101267}So, to go against what is|predestined, one must jump.
{101269}{101293}I jumped.
{101360}{101396}The fall was a holy event.
{101396}{101497}I broke my left arm and lost 2 fingers.|Why did I jump?
{101499}{101555}A slight abnormality in my personality,
{101564}{101617}imperceptible to those around me.
{101619}{101691}You can find me listed|in the medical encyclopedias
{101694}{101766}under "Sociopath" in the new editions.
{101766}{101814}Did you rape Saskia?
{101833}{101859}Come now, Mr. Hofman!
{101938}{102027}It was 26 years before a new|experience came to mind.
{102032}{102061}First place!
{102099}{102147}Denise! I thought so.
{102149}{102200}A bit to the left. There.
{102214}{102245}To the left.
{102248}{102288}Leave a space between you and mom...
{102291}{102341}Good. Keep still.
{102461}{102526}Smile! Or no pocket money.
{102660}{102677}Stay there.
{102710}{102770}Dad, there's a little girl|in the water!
{103904}{103943}Bidule drowned!
{103969}{104000}Who's Bidule?
{104007}{104048}My dolly.
{104065}{104137}The man won't save her.
{104269}{104321}- Goodbye.|- Thank you very much.
{104501}{104588}Dad, you're a hero!|Jumping in without a second thought!
{104590}{104643}Of course! I'm a hero.
{104676}{104715}But never trust a hero.
{104717}{104799}A hero is capable of rash gestures.
{104818}{104899}My daughter was bursting|with pride.
{104921}{105036}But I thought that her admiration|wasn't worth anything...
{105055}{105141}unless I could prove myself|absolutely incapable
{105156}{105206}of doing anything evil.
{105206}{105261}And as black cannot exist|without white,
{105264}{105336}I logically conceived|the most horrible deed
{105336}{105396}that I could envision|right at that moment.
{105412}{105499}But I want you to know,|for me killing is not the worst thing.
{105628}{105686}Could we stretch our legs?
{106594}{106645}Do you always come to France to cycle?
{106733}{106789}You were amateur, weren't you?
{106856}{106923}In cycling, "amateur" is a category.
{106925}{106978}I cycled for pleasure.
{106985}{107052}That's what I said:|you're an amateur.
{107072}{107179}The way up to Ventoux is the best place|to watch the Tour de France go by.
{107179}{107247}About a mile before the top
{107247}{107326}you can see who'll give way|and who'll try for a breakaway.
{107342}{107405}That's where I saw Zoltemque.
{107417}{107496}One of your compatriots, Zoltemque.
{107510}{107529}Know him?
{107558}{107637}Doesn't sound Dutch.|Sounds more like a Mexican god.
{107640}{107681}It's Zoetemelk.
{107688}{107728}Zoe-te-melk.
{107748}{107781}Couldn't be more Dutch.
{107784}{107827}It means "sweet milk."
{107827}{107877}Mr. Sweetmilk?
{107899}{107942}Some weird names you've got there.
{107947}{108007}Naaktgeboren , "born naked."
{108040}{108098}My neighbor has a dog called Rex.
{108206}{108242}Dodeman.
{108268}{108316}Mrs. Deadman.
{108330}{108412}Marriage produces some|strange combinations.
{108448}{108527}I know a woman called Friar-Towes.
{108527}{108568}"Fry-her-toes."
{108611}{108690}In the Nmes phone book,|there's a guy called Poof!
{108920}{109004}Ah, yes, we're not big on languages|in France. It's difficult.
{110596}{110644}Oh, it's impossible...
{110704}{110747}I'm wasting time...
{111011}{111040}That's better.
{111126}{111147}My car!
{111946}{111991}I'll wait for you there.
{113336}{113356}Asshole.
{113370}{113389}Pardon?
{113408}{113430}Nothing.
{113538}{113595}I see you speak very good French.
{113598}{113646}It certainly makes things easier.
{113730}{113792}My method wasn't very successful.
{113816}{113900}I couldn't get the women|I wanted into my car.
{113902}{113993}Prostitutes, yes.|But they don't interest me.
{114008}{114058}They're more obvious victims.
{114070}{114116}And nobody cares.
{114166}{114231}So I was getting high blood pressure.
{114245}{114291}Frustration.
{114785}{114823}And now, the presents!
{114857}{114892}Here's mine.
{115144}{115204}Tiles, for the house at St. Cme.
{116072}{116180}For your car keys.|And all the miles you have to drive...
{116240}{116262}Thanks, darling.
{116420}{116441}More?
{116499}{116561}YOUR LIFE
{116628}{116652}My glasses.
{116952}{117007}- Look at his ears.|- Oh, he's so cute.
{117012}{117048}A bit pudgy, huh?
{117134}{117197}That's when you fell|from the balcony.
{117468}{117530}It wasn't the trailer|that should be heavier...
{117530}{117580}It was me who should be weaker!
{117671}{117738}Here's the course of the Tour.|We're at the uphill climb
{117741}{117801}of Col du Coq,|the most important stretch
{117806}{117844}in this section of mountain passes.
{117844}{117897}The game gets serious now,|on this 17th day.
{117899}{117976}The Colombian Herrera, who'd left|the group behind has been overtaken...
{117976}{118041}The close fight between Fignon|and Hinault is starting again.
{118041}{118079}Hinault's pushing down hard...
{118081}{118163}It's the third time he's tried|to break away from Fignon.
{118165}{118228}But Fignon's not giving in.
{118230}{118316}He's sure he'll be wearing|the yellow jersey tonight at I'Alpe d'Huez.
{118316}{118374}The 2 men have now openly|drawn their swords...
{118374}{118434}but they're stabbing each other|with "banderillas".
{118594}{118683}But Fignon's not weakening...
{118685}{118757}and now, going by the summit...
{118760}{118944}Arroyo in front of Delgado,|Millar, Fignon and Hinault...
{118949}{118985}The fight begins...
{119016}{119069}One only has to top his adversary!
{119072}{119110}It's a battle of the giants...
{119124}{119151}And then you arrived.
{119177}{119244}Your friend even kissed you|before she got out.
{120059}{120177}Yes, we're 12 miles from the finish|line at the summit of I'Alpe d'Huez.
{120179}{120232}We're part of an extraordinary event!
{120237}{120330}I was right... Herrera wasn't to be|dismissed... I told you so.
{120335}{120395}Hinault's putting on a brave face,|fighting with exceptional courage.
{120400}{120462}He's giving Fignon|an open challenge.
{120465}{120508}In a few words,|this is the situation...
{120512}{120596}Herrera and Fignon will certainly|wear the yellow jersey tonight...
{120599}{120640}barring catastrophe.
{120711}{120738}Easy there!
{121090}{121114}Broken?
{121241}{121318}In Germany it's forbidden|to drive like that.
{121356}{121402}Even as a passenger?
{121426}{121541}I broke my arm when I was 1 1|years old. That was in 1 940.
{121555}{121608}59. You're 59.
{121625}{121723}I will be in November.|Right now, I'm still 58.
{121728}{121774}Yes, but most of the year has passed,
{121776}{121834}so there's more chance|that you'd be 59.
{121846}{121903}Therefore, my assumption|was correct.
{121932}{121958}Sorry.
{121975}{122025}Excuse me, miss.
{122030}{122073}- Do you speak French?|- Of course.
{122104}{122143}Could you help me?
{122148}{122222}I have a trailer. I need to hitch it|onto my car, but I can't do it alone.
{122236}{122256}My car!
{122268}{122315}Where's the trailer?
{122325}{122387}Over there. I'll bring the car.
{122407}{122474}I can come with you,|if you don't mind.
{122490}{122512}Sure.
{122663}{122713}But how can you drive?
{122716}{122764}You'll see, no problem.
{123394}{123423}Excuse me!
{124399}{124433}Destiny, Mr. Hofman.
{124454}{124497}If I hadn't sneezed...
{125025}{125046}Excuse me, sir.
{125085}{125111}Do you speak French?
{125135}{125159}I am French.
{125183}{125269}I don't have enough francs|for the vending machine.
{125272}{125303}Do you have any change?
{125363}{125444}Yes, so... I have 1 coin for 1 franc...
{125485}{125519}and 2 coins for 2 francs...
{125523}{125562}Do you have 5 francs?
{125672}{125713}No, I don't have 5...
{125737}{125816}But I do have 1 0,|and if you have 5...
{125826}{125921}I don't have 5, but... 6... 7...
{125945}{126020}Good, good. Sorry, sorry...|it's very kind but...
{126025}{126111}I'd get change... I'd rather... Bye!
{127269}{127379}I'm going to drive on the|highway for the first time.
{127415}{127477}It's very good to speak French.
{127482}{127559}My friend always says I must trying.
{127559}{127581}Try.
{127669}{127698}Your French is very good.
{127703}{127775}No, you are...
{127835}{127887}...a liar. Liar?
{127904}{127931}Correct.
{127995}{128031}Yes, look at me.
{128079}{128139}In your hand, very pretty!
{128194}{128271}Because my amigo , my amigo...
{128290}{128326}I love him very much,
{128333}{128417}and also has a name with...
{128422}{128511}Rex, Roel, Roger...
{128513}{128595}- Raymond.|- Raymond? Good.
{128621}{128643}Is it possible...
{128667}{128748}...for me buying a... a thing?
{128851}{128890}I'm a salesman for these.
{128928}{128993}I sell them.|I've got plenty in my car.
{128998}{129022}Here?
{129029}{129069}No, I don't...
{129081}{129105}Yes?
{129139}{129223}I... want... can...
{129290}{129316}Shit.
{129348}{129408}Want can to buy this thing?
{129415}{129436}Why not?
{129456}{129542}An "R"? Roel, Rex, Ray... Yes?
{129547}{129580}- Why not?|- But... a lot?
{129631}{129655}1 3.50 francs.
{129700}{129724}Like the frisbee?
{129786}{129818}I want very much!
{130213}{130237}Tiles.
{130256}{130297}- Oh, is called tiles?|- Yes.
{130302}{130347}I want a tile with an "R".
{130590}{130618}- Get in!|- Excuse me?
{130630}{130654}Get in!
{132505}{132570}Even the best laid plans can be...
{132630}{132675}What's happening...?
{133011}{133040}Just a bad connection.
{133054}{133105}You weren't wearing|your seat belt, sir.
{133121}{133148}I have a permit,
{133193}{133225}a medical certificate.
{133325}{133364}I'm claustrophobic.
{133464}{133486}Correct.
{133551}{133587}See what I was saying?
{133596}{133714}The best plans can be wiped out at|any moment by what we call fate.
{133721}{133771}I confess, that saddens me.
{134960}{134984}Mr. Hofman!
{135375}{135423}What did you do to her?
{135445}{135497}I'll tell you.|I promised you that.
{135497}{135605}But the only way to tell you, is to make|you share the exact same experience
{135615}{135663}You're completely insane.
{135680}{135723}It doesn't matter, really.
{135737}{135797}So she isn't dead?
{135819}{135855}Drink.
{135915}{135960}What's in it?
{135965}{136011}A sleeping pill.
{136011}{136082}I drugged her and now|I'm going to drug you.
{136111}{136135}And after?
{136186}{136269}After, you'll experience|exactly what she did.
{136368}{136473}If she's dead,|I'm also going to die.
{136516}{136540}You're crazy.
{136593}{136634}It's the only way.
{136677}{136725}You can't be serious!
{136759}{136816}I don't want to punish you.
{136819}{136847}I'm not saying another word.
{136866}{136900}I don't care about you.
{136922}{136998}All I want to know is|what happened to her.
{137003}{137042}I understand, Mr. Hofman.
{137042}{137089}I've put myself in your shoes.
{137106}{137185}In fact, I believe that you|don't want to punish me.
{137193}{137274}But I'm not so certain I should.|Understand?
{137284}{137377}I believe you,|but I must pretend that I don't.
{137435}{137463}So, drink.
{137497}{137552}It's truly the only way.
{137617}{137646}What's in it?
{137665}{137754}I've already told you:|a sleeping pill dissolved in coffee.
{137998}{138075}The car keys.|I'd love to look at them one more time.
{138283}{138387}Mr. Hofman, understand once|and for all:
{138437}{138490}what use are these keys to you?
{138514}{138542}You're powerless.
{138547}{138571}You're bluffing!
{138593}{138667}Assume you're right.|Can you be absolutely sure?
{138698}{138744}That's where your problem lies.
{138804}{138907}You must keep in mind the possibility|that there's no proof against me.
{138916}{138972}That could spoil all your chances.
{138979}{139070}Mr. Hofman, I've been analyzing|what goes in your head for the last 3 years.
{139072}{139142}You can leave.|Even go to the police with the keys.
{139144}{139252}But then, you'll never know|what happened to Miss Saskia.
{139281}{139386}On the other hand, drink...|and you'll know.
{139403}{139458}In less than 1 hour, I guarantee you.
{139511}{139542}I know all I need to know.
{139557}{139629}I don't care about the rest.|I'm leaving.
{139748}{139787}And the uncertainty?
{139806}{139871}The eternal uncertainty,|Mr. Hofman?
{139878}{139919}That's the worst.
{139983}{140034}I wanted to help you out!
{143048}{143064}So?
{143155}{143263}I told myself:|"Imagine you're drinking."
{143280}{143383}Where is it predestined|I won't drink?
{143390}{143505}So, to go against what is|predestined, I must drink.
{143553}{143604}It takes 10 minutes to work.
{143678}{143731}I drank it for her!
{143769}{143889}Sure! She never left you the time|to fall out of love!
{144874}{144970}Help! Help!
{145318}{145373}Help!
{145781}{145841}Oh no, it can't be!
{146920}{147018}My name is Rex Hofman|and that's a bit weird...
{147095}{147246}Rex Hofman... Rex Hof...
{148109}{148140}Saskia!
{148349}{148380}Saskia!
{150382}{150470}MYSTERIOUS DOUBLE|DISAPPEARANCE
{150473}{150643}AFTER SASKIA WAGTER|HER FRIEND REX HOFMAN...
