{25404}{25441}Don't you feel that way?
{25442}{25502}Who, me? Oh, yeah, sure.
{25503}{25543}Only I didn't know Macy's did.
{25544}{25586}KRIS:|As long as I'm here, they do.
{25587}{25633}WOMAN: I don't get it.
{25634}{25718}No, I just don't get it.
{26216}{26252}KRIS: I quite understand.
{26252}{26294}Your little girl|would like some skates.
{26295}{26333}But of course,|you must get her the best...
{26334}{26393}'cause their little ankles|want protecting.
{26394}{26474}Our skates are very good,|but not quite good enough.
{26475}{26524}You go to Gimbels.
{26525}{26561}They'll have exactly what|you're looking for.
{26562}{26619}There you are, dear.|That's for you.
{26620}{26647}Merry Christmas.
{26648}{26675}SHELLHAMMER: Gimbels.
{26676}{26765}KRIS: Hello, my little girl.|How old are you?
{26817}{26870}Gimbels.
{26871}{26923}Gimbels!
{26924}{26968}WOMAN: Pardon me.|The guard said to speak to you.
{26969}{27005}You're the head|of the toy department?
{27005}{27039}SHELLHAMMER: Yes, madam...
{27040}{27105}WOMAN: Listen. I want to|congratulate you and Macy's...
{27106}{27167}on this wonderful new stunt|you're pulling.
{27169}{27230}Imagine, sending people|to other stores.
{27231}{27271}I don't get it. Why, it's...
{27272}{27334}- It certainly is.|- You said it.
{27334}{27385}Imagine a big outfit|like Macy's...
{27386}{27446}putting the spirit of Christmas|ahead of the commercial.
{27448}{27491}It's wonderful.
{27492}{27542}I never done|much shopping here before...
{27543}{27643}but from now on, I'm going|to be a regular Macy customer.
{27644}{27678}All right, dear.
{27679}{27717}SHELLHAMMER: Thank you, madam.
{27799}{27869}SECRETARY: There are six more|women who want to thank you.
{27870}{27948}Not now. I've got|to think this thing over.
{27949}{28024}Personally, I think|it's a wonderful idea, too.
{28025}{28094}You think so.|Those women think so.
{28095}{28164}The point is,|will Mr. Macy think so?
{28243}{28317}SUZIE: This seems awfully silly,|Mr. Gailey.
{28318}{28385}GAILEY: I thought as long|as we're in the store...
{28386}{28437}you might as well|say hello to Santa Claus.
{28438}{28474}SUZIE: Why?
{28475}{28526}GAILEY: Because when|you talk to him...
{28527}{28575}you might feel|differently about him.
{28711}{28782}KRIS: Good-bye, Elmer.|Be a good boy now.
{28783}{28812}Merry Christmas!
{28838}{28875}Well, young lady,|what's your name?
{28876}{28926}SUZIE: Susan Walker.|What's yours?
{28927}{28981}KRIS: Mine? Kris Kringle.
{28982}{29029}I'm Santa Claus.
{29030}{29110}Oh, you don't believe that,|do you?
{29111}{29207}SUZIE: My mother's Mrs. Walker,|the lady who hired you.
{29209}{29244}KRIS: Oh.
{29245}{29318}SUZIE: But I must say,|you're the best one I've seen.
{29319}{29349}KRIS: Really?
{29350}{29412}SUZIE: Your beard doesn't have|those things over your ears.
{29413}{29488}KRIS: That's because it's real,|like I'm really Santa Claus.
{29518}{29566}Oh, go ahead, pull it.
{29597}{29628}Ouch.
{29694}{29741}CLERK: All right, folks,|don't crowd.
{29742}{29782}You have all day|to see Santa Claus.
{29783}{29839}Now, children, behave.|This way, please.
{29840}{29874}Get back in the line there.
{29875}{29947}KRIS: What would you like me|to bring you for Christmas?
{29948}{29994}SUZIE: Nothing, thank you.
{29995}{30047}KRIS: Oh, come now.|You must want something.
{30048}{30104}SUZIE: Whatever I want,|my mother will get for me...
{30105}{30164}if it's sensible and doesn't|cost too much, of course.
{30165}{30192}Hello, Mother.
{30193}{30227}DORIS: Hello, Susan, Mr. Gailey.
{30228}{30308}I think you've taken up enough|of this gentleman's time.
{30309}{30388}GAILEY: The explanation for this|is all very simple.
{30389}{30427}Cleo's mother|sprained her ankle.
{30428}{30488}She had to go home and asked me|to bring Suzie down to you.
{30489}{30548}DORIS: Yes, Cleo called me.|I was wondering where you were.
{30550}{30613}GAILEY: As long as we're here,|we should say hello to Santa.
{30614}{30704}SUZIE: He's a nice old man,|and those whiskers are real.
{30705}{30775}DORIS: Yes, dear. Many men|have long beards like that.
{30775}{30819}Susan, would you stand|over here a minute?
{30820}{30880}I want to talk to Mr. Gailey.
{30881}{30952}GAILEY: I shouldn't have brought|Suzie to see Santa Claus?
{30953}{31023}DORIS: You're making me feel|like the proverbial stepmother.
{31024}{31076}GAILEY: I'm sorry, but I just|couldn't see any harm...
{31077}{31123}in just saying hello|to the old fellow.
{31124}{31167}DORIS:|But I think there is harm.
{31168}{31231}I tell her Santa Claus is|a myth, you bring her here...
{31232}{31283}and she sees hundreds|of gullible children...
{31284}{31354}meets a very convincing|old man with real whiskers.
{31355}{31432}This sets up a very harmful|mental conflict within her.
{31433}{31497}What is she going to think?|Who is she going to believe?
{31634}{31669}And by filling them|full of fairy tales...
{31670}{31752}they grow up considering life|a fantasy instead of a reality.
{31753}{31824}They keep waiting for|Prince Charming to come along.
{31825}{31872}And when he does,|he turns out to be a...
{31873}{31939}GAILEY: We were talking|about Suzie, not about you.
{31940}{31984}DORIS:|Whether you agree or not...
{31985}{32063}I must ask you to respect|my wishes regarding Susan.
{32063}{32106}She's my responsibility...
{32107}{32152}and I must bring her up|as I see fit.
{32153}{32180}GAILEY: OK.
{32368}{32415}- Say "Thank you."|- Thank you.
{32416}{32458}KRIS: Bye. Merry Christmas!
{32519}{32570}Well, young lady,|what's your name?
{32571}{32622}MOTHER: I'm sorry.|She doesn't speak English.
{32623}{32689}She's Dutch. She just came over.
{32689}{32740}She's been living|in an orphans home...
{32741}{32804}in Rotterdam ever since...
{32805}{32834}We've adopted her.
{32835}{32895}I told her you wouldn't|be able to speak to her...
{32896}{32943}but when she saw you|in the parade yesterday...
{32944}{33007}she said you were|"Sinter Claes"...
{33008}{33054}and you could talk to her.
{33055}{33082}I didn't know what to do.
{33083}{33154}KRIS: Hello. [Speaking Dutch]
{33155}{33212}[Speaking Dutch]
{33718}{33789}[Singing in Dutch]
{34263}{34302}DORIS: Now do you understand?
{34303}{34346}SUZIE: Yes, I see what|you mean, Mother.
{34347}{34377}DORIS: Good.
{34378}{34459}SUZIE: But when he spoke Dutch|to that girl, he was so...
{34460}{34543}DORIS: Susan, I speak French,|but I'm not Joan of Arc.
{34544}{34615}What I'm trying|to explain is... Come in.
{34615}{34660}KRIS: They said you wanted|to see me, Mrs. Walker.
{34661}{34696}DORIS: Come right in.
{34697}{34734}KRIS: Hello there!|Good to see you again.
{34735}{34768}SUZIE: It's nice to see you.
{34769}{34803}KRIS: You're awfully lucky,|Mrs. Walker.
{34803}{34845}Lovely little girl|you have here.
{34846}{34916}DORIS: Thank you. Susan's why|I asked you to drop down.
{34917}{34947}She's a little confused...
{34948}{34985}and I thought you could help|straighten her out.
{34987}{35016}KRIS: Oh, glad to.
{35017}{35109}Would you please tell her|you're not really Santa Claus...
{35110}{35174}that there actually|is no such person?
{35175}{35221}KRIS: I'm sorry to disagree|with you, Mrs. Walker.
{35222}{35290}Not only is there such a person,|but here I am to prove it.
{35291}{35340}No, you misunderstand.
{35341}{35412}I want you to tell her|the truth. What's your name?
{35412}{35461}Kris Kringle. I'll bet|you're in the first grade.
{35462}{35489}SUZIE: Second.
{35490}{35529}I mean your real name.
{35530}{35584}That is my real name.|Second grade?
{35585}{35619}SUZIE:|It's a progressive school.
{35620}{35684}KRIS: Oh,|it's a progressive school.
{35685}{35742}DORIS: May I have this man's|employment card, please?
{35743}{35770}WOMAN: Yes, Mrs. Walker.
{35771}{35806}KRIS: This dress is very cute.
{35807}{35851}Where did you get|such a lovely outfit?
{35852}{35917}SUZIE: Here at Macy's.|We get 10% off.
{35918}{35990}DORIS: Please don't feel|you have to pretend for Susan.
{35990}{36037}She's a very|intelligent child...
{36038}{36088}and always wants to know|the absolute truth.
{36089}{36135}KRIS: Good, because I always|tell the absolute truth.
{36135}{36207}About your school...|What's the name of your teacher?
{36208}{36258}SUZIE: Mrs. Haley.
{36259}{36322}- Here it is, Mrs. Walker.|- Thank you.
{36323}{36379}KRIS: What else do you do|besides read and play games?
{36380}{36456}SUZIE: We have rest periods|for one half-hour.
{36457}{36507}KRIS: I don't suppose|you care for that, eh?
{36508}{36582}SUZIE: No. We're not allowed|to talk or anything.
{36583}{36666}SUZIE: Tuesday, Chester Richards|kept talking all the time.
{36667}{36717}KRIS: My, that was bad, eh?
{36718}{36802}SUZIE: Mrs. Haley made him rest|all alone for nearly an hour.
{36803}{36903}DORIS: Susan, would you go out|and talk to Miss Adams?
{36904}{36943}I'll be right with you.
{36944}{36979}SUZIE: All right. Good-bye.
{36980}{37023}KRIS: Good-bye, young lady.|Hope to see you again.
{37024}{37079}SUZIE: Thank you.|I hope so, too. Bye.
{37080}{37107}KRIS: Good-bye.
{37108}{37191}DORIS:|I'm sorry, Mr., uh... Mr...
{37191}{37223}KRIS: Kringle.
{37224}{37271}DORIS: I'm sorry, but we're|going to have to make a change.
{37272}{37299}KRIS: Change?
{37300}{37351}DORIS: The Santa Claus|that we had two years ago...
{37352}{37402}is back in town,|and I feel we owe it to him...
{37403}{37439}KRIS:|Have I done something wrong?
{37440}{37489}DORIS: Oh, no, no.
{37491}{37529}Well...
{37530}{37567}[Buzz]
{37568}{37595}DORIS: Yes?
{37596}{37658}WOMAN: Mr. Macy wants|to see you immediately.
{37659}{37694}DORIS: I'll be right up.
{37742}{37782}DORIS: Would you sit down...
{37783}{37857}and I'll be right back|and sign your pay voucher.
{37898}{37934}SECRETARY: Yes, indeed.
{37934}{38019}Go right in.|Mr. Macy's waiting.
{38055}{38114}MACY: The effect this will|have on the public is...
{38115}{38149}Come in, Mrs. Walker.
{38150}{38241}- Hello, Mrs. Walker.|- Sit over here.
{38242}{38316}MACY: I've been telling these|gentlemen the new policy...
{38317}{38358}you and Mr. Shellhammer|initiated.
{38359}{38425}I can't say that I approve|of your not consulting...
{38426}{38470}the advertising department|first...
{38471}{38552}but in the face of this|tremendous public response...
{38553}{38600}I can't be angry with you.
{38601}{38657}- What's he talking about?|- Tell you later.
{38658}{38691}MACY:|Now, to continue, gentlemen.
{38691}{38783}I admit this plan sounds|idiotic and impossible.
{38783}{38871}Imagine Macy's Santa Claus|sending customers to Gimbels.
{38872}{38982}Ho ho. But, gentlemen,|you cannot argue with success.
{38983}{39031}Look at this.
{39032}{39079}Telegrams,|messages, telephone calls.
{39080}{39128}The governor's wife,|the mayor's wife...
{39129}{39176}over 500 thankful parents...
{39177}{39230}expressing|undying gratitude to Macy's.
{39231}{39289}Never in my entire career...
{39290}{39347}have I seen such a tremendous|and immediate response...
{39347}{39390}to a merchandising policy.
{39391}{39479}And I'm positive, Frank,|if we expand our policy...
{39480}{39527}we'll expand|our results as well.
{39528}{39588}Therefore, from now on...
{39589}{39647}not only will our Santa Claus|continue in this manner...
{39648}{39714}but I want every salesperson|in this store...
{39714}{39757}to do precisely the same thing.
{39758}{39829}If we haven't got exactly|what the customer wants...
{39832}{39882}we'll send him|where he can get it.
{39883}{39930}No high pressuring|and forcing a customer...
{39930}{39969}to take something|he doesn't really want.
{39970}{40050}We'll be known|as the helpful store...
{40051}{40115}the friendly store,|the store with a heart...
{40116}{40204}the store that places|public service ahead of profits.
{40205}{40276}And, consequently, we'll make|more profits than ever before.
{40277}{40345}Yes, I know it's late,|and we're all tired...
{40345}{40378}and we want to go to dinner...
{40379}{40433}so we'll continue first thing|in the morning.
{40433}{40487}In the meantime,|you fellas get together...
{40488}{40539}and figure out the best way|to promote this thing.
{40540}{40593}ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE:|We'll do that. Good night, R.H.
{40594}{40621}MACY: Good night.
{40622}{40699}I want to thank you two again.
{40700}{40740}And in your|Christmas envelopes...
{40741}{40804}you'll find a more practical|expression of my gratitude.
{40805}{40832}SHELLHAMMER:|Thank you, Mr. Macy.
{40834}{40881}MACY: Tell that Santa|I won't forget him, either.
{40882}{40928}SHELLHAMMER: Yes, Mr. Macy.
{41014}{41078}SHELLHAMMER: Lmagine, a bonus!
{41079}{41157}He just assumed it was our idea.|What's the matter?
{41158}{41206}- I fired him.|- Who?
{41207}{41261}- Santa Claus.|- What?
{41262}{41313}DORIS: He's crazy.|He thinks he is Santa Claus.
{41314}{41368}SHELLHAMMER: I don't care if|he thinks he's the Easter Bunny.
{41369}{41397}Get him back.
{41398}{41434}DORIS: He's insane, I tell you.
{41435}{41494}We'll hire somebody else|and have him do the same thing.
{41495}{41555}SHELLHAMMER: You heard Mr. Macy.|We've got to keep him.
{41556}{41608}DORIS: What if he should have|a sudden fit?
{41609}{41662}Oh, no.|I've got to tell Mr. Macy.
{41663}{41721}SHELLHAMMER: But maybe|he's only a little crazy...
{41722}{41770}like painters or composers...
{41770}{41816}or some of those men|in Washington.
{41817}{41863}We can't be sure|until he's been examined.
{41864}{41944}If you fire him, and we find out|he wasn't really crazy...
{41945}{42026}Mr. Macy will have us|examined and fired.
{42027}{42083}DORIS: I suppose|we ought to be sure.
{42084}{42128}We could if Mr. Sawyer|talked to him.
{42129}{42170}SHELLHAMMER: Of course.|He's a psychologist.
{42171}{42229}He's paid to examine employees.
{42230}{42297}Until we get his report,|we won't say a word.
{42298}{42356}DORIS: I'll get in touch|with him right away.
{42357}{42400}SHELLHAMMER: First,|get that Santa Claus back!
{42401}{42458}The examination is worthless|without the patient.
{42489}{42554}DORIS: It was just because|I felt we owed it to him...
{42555}{42617}but Mr. Macy suggested|that we find something else...
{42618}{42693}for the other Santa Claus|and keep you on by all means.
{42693}{42766}KRIS: Oh, well, thanks.|That's mighty good news.
{42768}{42826}DORIS: You'll be here|in the morning then?
{42826}{42854}KRIS: Certainly I will.
{42855}{42922}Mrs. Walker, this is|quite an opportunity for me.
{42923}{42969}For the past 50 years or so...
{42970}{43022}I've been getting more|worried about Christmas.
{43023}{43112}Seems we're all so busy trying|to beat the other fellow...
{43113}{43185}in making things go faster,|look shinier, and cost less...
{43185}{43262}that Christmas and I are sort of|getting lost in the shuffle.
{43263}{43330}DORIS: I don't think so.|Christmas is still Christmas.
{43331}{43382}KRIS:|Christmas isn't just a day.
{43383}{43456}It's a frame of mind.|That's what's been changing.
{43457}{43533}That's why I'm glad I'm here.|Maybe I can do something.
{43534}{43574}And I'm glad|I met you and your daughter.
{43575}{43624}You two are a test case for me.
{43625}{43655}DORIS: We are?
{43656}{43718}KRIS: Yes. You're sort of|the whole thing in miniature.
{43719}{43791}If I can win you over,|there's still hope.
{43791}{43882}If not,|then I guess I'm through.
{43883}{43958}But I'm warning you,|I don't give up easily.
{43959}{43996}Good night.
{43997}{44024}DORIS: Good night.
{44025}{44080}Oh, Mr. Kringle,|first thing in the morning...
{44081}{44136}would you report|to Mr. Sawyer's office?
{44137}{44203}He'll give you|a little examination.
{44204}{44270}Oh, we do it|with all our employees.
{44271}{44314}KRIS: A mental examination?
{44343}{44392}Well...
{44393}{44457}KRIS: I don't mind.|I've taken dozens of them.
{44458}{44532}Never failed one yet.|Know them by heart.
{44533}{44621}- How many days in the week?|- Seven.
{44622}{44684}- How many fingers do you see?|- Four.
{44684}{44732}Muscular coordination test.
{44838}{44880}No damage|to the nervous system.
{44881}{44939}Who was the first president|of the United States?
{44940}{44972}George Washington.
{44973}{45051}Who was vice president|under John Quincy Adams?
{45075}{45131}Daniel D. Tompkins.
{45132}{45188}I'll bet your Mr. Sawyer|doesn't know that.
{45189}{45217}Good night.
{45531}{45577}Miss Adams, would you get me...
{45578}{45656}the Brooks' Memorial Home|in Great Neck?
{45657}{45719}It's a home for old people.|That's right.
{45720}{45781}I want to talk|to the doctor in charge.
{45989}{46052}- How many days in the week?|- Seven.
{46053}{46113}SAWYER: The first president|of the United States?
{46114}{46141}KRIS: George Washington.
{46142}{46174}SAWYER: Three times five?
{46174}{46237}You asked me that before.|The answer's at the bottom...
{46238}{46290}I'm conducting this examination.
{46291}{46334}How much is three times five?
{46335}{46404}Same as before... 15.
{46478}{46554}You're rather nervous,|aren't you, Mr. Sawyer?
{46555}{46594}Do you get enough sleep?
{46595}{46643}SAWYER: My personal habits|are of no concern to you.
{46644}{46719}KRIS: Oh, I'm sorry.|I hate to see someone tied up...
{46720}{46783}- How many fingers do you see?|- Three.
{46784}{46843}You bite your nails, too.|Tsk tsk tsk.
{46844}{46925}I want you to stand|with your feet together...
{46926}{46974}and your arms extended.|Then I want you to...
{46975}{47010}KRIS:|Muscular coordination test?
{47011}{47092}Surely. Be glad to. Ha ha.
{47147}{47230}KRIS: Sometimes the cause|of nervous habits like yours...
{47231}{47286}is not obvious. No.
{47287}{47355}Often they're the result|of an insecurity.
{47356}{47396}Are you happy at home?
{47397}{47431}SAWYER: That will be all!
{47432}{47485}The examination's over.|You may go.
{47486}{47513}KRIS: Thank you.
{47514}{47545}SAWYER:|You may go out that way.
{47621}{47669}And it may|interest you to know...
{47670}{47727}that I've been happily|married for 26 years.
{47727}{47800}Really? Delighted to hear it.
{47801}{47834}Good-bye.
{47945}{47972}Get me Mrs. Walker.
{47973}{48039}Yes, sir. Your wife's on 672.
{48040}{48083}She says it's very important.
{48127}{48220}How many times have I told you|not to bother me at the office?
{48221}{48292}No. Not a penny.|I give you a liberal allowance.
{48293}{48334}It's up to you|to run the house on it.
{48335}{48382}If your stupid brother|would get a job...
{48383}{48434}you wouldn't have to|pester me all the time.
{48435}{48495}[Buzz]
{48495}{48577}Mrs. Walker, I'd like to talk|to you about this Kringle.
{48578}{48652}Oh, yes. Dr. Pierce|from the Brooks' home is here.
{48654}{48698}It would be a good time|to settle the matter.
{48699}{48749}Sorry, Doctor,|but that was Mr. Sawyer...
{48750}{48797}the gentleman|I was telling you about.
{48798}{48851}He's just down the hall.
{48851}{48935}I can't tell you how|we appreciate your time.
{48936}{49013}PIERCE: Matter of fact,|I was going to call you today.
{49014}{49104}I had a feeling about now|you'd be wondering about Kris.
{49105}{49175}DORIS: Dr. Pierce, Mr. Sawyer.
{49176}{49207}PIERCE: How do you do?
{49208}{49275}SAWYER: After giving this man|a comprehensive examination...
{49275}{49324}it's my opinion he should|be dismissed immediately.
{49325}{49406}Really? He failed|to pass the examination?
{49407}{49467}- Yes.|- He didn't answer correctly?
{49468}{49539}SAWYER: Yes, he did,|but he lacked concentration.
{49540}{49598}He kept changing the subject.|Even questioned me.
{49599}{49646}I don't think|there's any doubt about it.
{49646}{49694}He should be placed|in a mental institution.
{49694}{49767}PIERCE: I don't agree.|People are institutionalized...
{49768}{49821}to prevent them from|harming themselves or others.
{49825}{49869}Mr. Kringle|is incapable of either.
{49870}{49905}His is a delusion for good.
{49906}{49952}He only wants|to be friendly and helpful.
{49953}{49999}SHELLHAMMER:|That's what I feel, too.
{49999}{50049}PIERCE: Thousands of people|have similar delusions...
{50050}{50096}living perfectly normal lives|in every other respect.
{50097}{50166}A famous example|is that fellow...
{50167}{50226}I can't think of his name.
{50227}{50284}For years, he's insisted|he's a Russian prince.
{50285}{50333}There's been much evidence|to prove him wrong...
{50334}{50379}but nothing|has shaken his story.
{50380}{50416}Is he in an institution?
{50417}{50472}No. He owns a famous restaurant|in Hollywood...
{50473}{50504}and is a highly|respected citizen.
{50505}{50583}SAWYER: I've made a great study|of abnormal psychology...
{50584}{50664}and I've found from experience|when a delusion is challenged...
{50665}{50702}the deluded|is apt to become violent.
{50703}{50751}PIERCE: I'll have to disagree|with you again.
{50751}{50818}If you tell Kris|there is no Santa Claus...
{50819}{50878}I grant he'll argue the point,|but he'll not become violent.
{50879}{50932}His whole manner|suggests aggressiveness!
{50933}{51002}Look how he carries that cane!|He's never without it.
{51003}{51060}I know Kris|always carries a cane...
{51060}{51119}but surely you're not implying|he'd use the cane as a weapon?
{51120}{51218}SAWYER: Mrs. Walker, naturally|I can't discharge this man.
{51219}{51305}That's up to you.|But you asked my opinion.
{51306}{51351}So when he exhibits his latent|maniacal tendencies...
{51352}{51398}which I assure you he will...
{51399}{51462}please realize|the responsibility is yours.
{51593}{51647}Speaking of delusions...
{51648}{51704}Now we're right back|where we started.
{51705}{51740}No, we're not.
{51740}{51799}After listening to Dr. Pierce,|I feel perfectly confident.
{51800}{51871}But if anything happens,|you won't get blamed. I will.
{51872}{51935}PIERCE:|Nothing's going to happen.
{51936}{51999}Please don't feel what I've said|was prompted by affection.
{52000}{52047}My specialty is geriatrics.
{52048}{52079}Huh?
{52080}{52117}PIERCE: Treatment|of the diseases of old age.
{52118}{52167}I've had quite a bit|of experience...
{52168}{52268}and I assure you Kris has|no latent maniacal tendencies.
{52269}{52309}You'll want to discuss this|with Mr. Shellhammer...
{52310}{52371}so I'll be on my way.|May I see Kris?
{52372}{52408}DORIS: Why, certainly, Doctor.
{52409}{52454}Use the employees' elevator.|It's much quicker.
{52455}{52489}SHELLHAMMER:|The same one you came up on.
{52490}{52547}- Where is that?|- I'll show you.
{52548}{52590}PIERCE: That isn't necessary.|I'll find my way.
{52591}{52650}DORIS: You understand|my position, Doctor.
{52651}{52689}If there's the slightest|possibility...
{52690}{52751}of him becoming violent|or getting into trouble...
{52752}{52798}SHELLHAMMER:|What trouble could he get into?
{52799}{52864}DORIS: All that's got to happen|is a policeman to ask his name.
{52865}{52933}A big argument.|Clang, clang! Bellevue!
{52934}{52981}PIERCE: You can prevent that|very simply.
{52982}{53032}If he could|stay with an employee...
{53033}{53086}they could ride|to and from work together.
{53087}{53161}I'd prefer he didn't take the|train to Great Neck twice a day.
{53162}{53197}SHELLHAMMER:|That would solve everything.
{53198}{53248}They could steer him away|from trouble.
{53249}{53284}DORIS:|Sort of take custody of him.
{53284}{53322}Do you think|he'd agree to that?
{53323}{53363}PIERCE: I'll talk to him.|I'm sure he will.
{53364}{53399}DORIS:|In that case, he can stay.
{53399}{53438}PIERCE: Good. Thank you.
{53439}{53508}DORIS: It's the seventh floor,|and thank you very much.
{53509}{53537}- Bye, Doctor.|- Bye.
{53574}{53635}SHELLHAMMER: I'm sure|you made a wise decision.
{53636}{53703}Now, let's see...|who could rent him a room?
{53704}{53731}DORIS: You.
{53733}{53795}Your son's away at school.|What about his room?
{53796}{53868}Well, I don't mind.|I'd be glad to.
{53869}{53928}I'm positive Mrs. Shellhammer|wouldn't like it.
{53929}{53967}She's a little...
{53968}{54015}Say, I have an idea.
{54016}{54062}We always have martinis|before dinner.
{54063}{54125}I'll make them|double-strength tonight.
{54126}{54198}I'll bet after a couple of them,|she'll be more receptive.
{54199}{54239}But Kris is through work|at 6:00.
{54240}{54282}What about|the in-between time?
{54283}{54324}Take him home to dinner.
{54325}{54398}I'll call soon as my wife's|plastered... feeling gay.
{54399}{54432}DORIS: Oh, no.
{54432}{54470}SHELLHAMMER: If I'm willing|to let my wife...
{54471}{54517}have a big headache|in the morning...
{54517}{54562}you can have|a little headache tonight.
{54563}{54604}DORIS: All right.
{54605}{54660}SHELLHAMMER: Won't take an hour.|Everything will be OK.
{54684}{54746}KRIS: Good. Very good.
{54747}{54832}What sort of games do you play|with the other children?
{54833}{54922}I don't play much with them.|They play silly games.
{54923}{54953}They do?
{54954}{55018}Like today. They were|in the basement playing zoo...
{55019}{55070}and all of them were animals.
{55071}{55150}When I came down, Homer...|he was the zookeeper...
{55151}{55226}he said, "What animal are you?"
{55227}{55304}I said,|"I'm not an animal, I'm a girl."
{55305}{55354}And he said,|"Only animals allowed."
{55355}{55400}So I came upstairs.
{55401}{55454}Why didn't you tell him|you were a lion or a bear?
{55455}{55501}SUZIE: Because|I'm not a bear or a lion.
{55502}{55572}KRIS: But the other children|were only children...
{55573}{55620}and they were pretending|to be animals.
{55621}{55677}SUZIE: That's what makes|the game so silly.
{55678}{55707}KRIS: I don't think so.
{55708}{55766}Sounds like|a wonderful game to me.
{55767}{55899}Of course, in order to play it,|you need an imagination.
{55899}{55960}Do you know|what the imagination is?
{55961}{55991}Oh, sure.
{55992}{56056}That's when you see things,|but they're not really there.
{56057}{56143}That can be caused|by other things, too.
{56144}{56229}No, to me the imagination|is a place all by itself...
{56230}{56277}a separate country.
{56278}{56352}You've heard of the French|or the British nation.
{56353}{56400}Well, this is|the lmagine nation.
{56401}{56452}It's a wonderful place.
{56453}{56603}How would you like to make|snowballs in the summertime?
{56604}{56703}Or drive a big bus|right down 5th Avenue?
{56704}{56765}How would you like to have|a ship all to yourself...
{56767}{56862}that makes daily trips|to China and Australia?
{56863}{56925}How would you like to be|the Statue of Liberty...
{56926}{56981}in the morning,|and in the afternoon...
{56982}{57026}fly south with a flock of geese?
{57082}{57163}It's very simple.|Of course, it takes practice.
{57164}{57272}The first thing you've got|to learn is how to pretend.
{57274}{57369}And the next time Homer says,|"What kind of animal are you?"
{57370}{57417}Tell him you're a monkey.
{57418}{57465}I don't know how to be a monkey.
{57466}{57524}Sure you do.|Here, I'll show you.
{57525}{57573}Now just bend|your body over a little.
{57573}{57621}Let your arms hang loose, see?
{57621}{57682}Now put your right hand|up here... under here.
{57684}{57767}Now scratch yourself, see?|That's right.
{57768}{57838}Put your tongue under your lips,|over your teeth.
{57839}{57910}- Like this?|- That's right.
{57911}{57957}Now scratch yourself|and chatter, see?
{57958}{58034}- Bla bla bla!|- Eeek!
{58035}{58068}Eeek erp!
{58069}{58148}Haislip, Haislip, Sherman,|Mackenzie, and Haislip...
{58149}{58185}have been very kind to me.
{58186}{58271}But being an exceptional lawyer,|I want to open my own office.
{58272}{58332}DORIS: Put this in|Susan's place for me, please.
{58333}{58387}GAILEY: Take the meat out.|It should be done.
{58441}{58484}KRIS: Don't forget to scratch.
{58485}{58545}Put your tongue up|in front of your teeth.
{58545}{58603}Talk to the other monkeys.
{58604}{58659}GAILEY: What's going on here?
{58660}{58711}KRIS: We're having|our first lesson in pretending.
{58712}{58760}Doing quite well at it, too.
{58761}{58832}That's right.|Call the other monkeys.
{58833}{58941}No. You mustn't be a goose.|Be a monkey.
{58942}{59008}- Mr. Kringle...|- Yes?
{59009}{59058}Mrs. Walker|just happened to mention...
{59059}{59110}that they're looking|for a room for you.
{59111}{59143}KRIS: That's right.
{59144}{59206}Dr. Pierce doesn't want me|making the long trip daily.
{59207}{59251}GAILEY: I was just thinking.
{59251}{59322}I'm all alone in my apartment.
{59323}{59382}Twin beds, plenty of room.
{59383}{59455}If you'd like|to move in with me...
{59456}{59503}I'd be only too happy|to have you.
{59504}{59543}KRIS:|That's awfully nice of you.
{59544}{59613}You could ride to and from|work with Mrs. Walker.
{59614}{59691}Yes. That would|give me a chance...
{59692}{59754}to really talk things|over with her.
{59758}{59812}[Suzie chattering]
{59813}{59910}KRIS: Don't forget to scratch.|You're not scratching.
{59911}{59976}Besides, I could see|Suzie now and then.
{59977}{60020}Mr. Gailey, it's a deal.
{60021}{60055}- Good!|- [Telephone rings]
{60055}{60135}We'll get your things|after dinner.
{60136}{60190}Hello.|Oh, yes, just a moment.
{60191}{60227}It's a Mr. Shellhammer.
{60228}{60255}DORIS: Thanks.
{60281}{60324}Hello, Mr. Shellhammer.
{60324}{60375}Yes. Just a moment.
{60376}{60429}Mrs. Shellhammer|wants to talk to you.
{60461}{60523}I made the martinis|triple-strength...
{60524}{60571}and she feels wonderful.
{60603}{60643}Here, my pet.
{60644}{60686}MRS. SHELLHAMMER: Ha ha.
{60687}{60722}Hello?
{60759}{60793}Hello?
{60793}{60841}SHELLHAMMER: No, no. No, dear.
{60841}{60897}MRS. SHELLHAMMER:|Thank you, darling.
{60898}{60941}[Giggles]
{60942}{60987}Hello?
{60987}{61054}SHELLHAMMER:|No, no, dear. There.
{61055}{61131}MRS. SHELLHAMMER:|Oh, darling, how silly of me!
{61171}{61211}Hello!
{61253}{61362}We'd love to have Santa Claus|come and stay with us.
{61363}{61406}[Giggles]
{61407}{61484}I think it would be|simply charming.
{61485}{61541}Oh, and so do I,|Mrs. Shellhammer.
{61542}{61589}Just a moment.
{61590}{61661}It's Mrs. Shellhammer.|They have the loveliest room.
{61663}{61713}They'd be so happy|if you'd stay with them.
{61714}{61761}That's very sweet of them.
{61762}{61794}Please thank them very much...
{61795}{61878}but I'm going to stay|with Mr. Gailey.
{61879}{61906}DORIS: Mr. Gailey.
{61907}{61971}I think|I'd better get the meat.
{62038}{62077}KRIS: Yes, I understand that...
{62078}{62129}but there must be something|you want for Christmas...
{62130}{62189}something you haven't|even told your mother.
{62190}{62244}Oh, come on, now.
{62245}{62292}Why don't you give me a chance?
{62330}{62378}Well...
{62781}{62834}SUZIE: That's what|I want for Christmas.
{62835}{62874}KRIS:|A doll's house like this?
{62875}{62937}No, a real house.
{62938}{62990}If you're really Santa Claus,|you can get it for me.
{62991}{63020}And if you can't...
{63021}{63085}you're only a nice man with|a white beard, like mother said.
{63086}{63124}Now wait a minute, Suzie.
{63125}{63181}Just because every child|can't get his wish...
{63182}{63217}doesn't mean|there isn't a Santa Claus.
{63218}{63274}That's what I thought you'd say.
{63274}{63317}But don't you see, dear?
{63318}{63388}Some children wish for things|they couldn't possibly use...
{63389}{63453}like real locomotives|or B-29s.
{63454}{63539}But this isn't like|a locomotive or a B-29.
{63540}{63602}It's awful big|for a little girl like you.
{63602}{63668}What could you do|with a house like this?
{63669}{63713}SUZIE:|Live in it with my mother.
{63713}{63767}KRIS: But you've got|this lovely apartment.
{63768}{63807}I don't think it's lovely.
{63808}{63914}I want a backyard with a great|big tree to put a swing on...
{64000}{64046}I guess you can't get it, huh?
{64046}{64104}I didn't say that.
{64105}{64141}Well...
{64253}{64324}Well, it's a tall order...
{64325}{64372}but I'll do my best.
{64373}{64411}May I keep this picture?
{64413}{64453}Mm-hmm.
{64454}{64536}Thank you. Good night, Susan.
{64537}{64584}SUZIE: Good night, Mr. Kringle.
{65727}{65774}KRIS:|Nice place you've got here.
{65775}{65822}GAILEY: Was I lucky to get it!
{65823}{65904}KRIS: You like living|in Manhattan?
{65905}{65952}GAILEY: It's all right.
{65953}{66009}Someday I'd like to get|a place on Long Island.
{66010}{66042}Not a big house.
{66043}{66120}One of those junior-partner|deals around Manhasset.
{66121}{66205}KRIS: I know just|the kind of place you mean.
{66207}{66287}One of those|little Colonial houses.
{66288}{66346}GAILEY: Either that or Cape Cod.
{66347}{66407}KRIS:|You're right about Mrs. Walker.
{66408}{66456}A little more effort|on your part...
{66457}{66528}and she might crawl out|of that shell.
{66529}{66576}Take her to dinner, the theater.
{66577}{66616}GAILEY: I've tried that.
{66617}{66671}She's always too busy|with her job.
{66672}{66736}KRIS: Try a little harder.|Those two are lost souls.
{66737}{66781}It's up to us to help them.
{66781}{66853}I'll take care of Suzie|if you take care of her mother.
{66854}{66901}- It's a deal.|- Ready?
{66902}{66960}Oh, no, you don't.|I'm not gonna be cheated.
{66961}{67011}All my life|I've wondered something.
{67013}{67060}Now's my chance to find out.
{67061}{67119}It's a question that's puzzled|the world for centuries.
{67120}{67235}Does Santa Claus sleep|with his whiskers outside or in?
{67236}{67283}KRIS:|Always sleep with them out.
{67284}{67332}Cold air makes them grow.
{67486}{67524}MAN: Joe, we're running|out of books.
{67525}{67563}JOE: I'll get some right away.
{67564}{67608}WOMAN:|I need some more Wanamakers.
{68184}{68242}SALESMAN:|Yes, I know just what you want.
{68243}{68315}We don't carry that brand,|but I think Gimbels does.
{68315}{68399}Let me see. Yes, here it is.
{68400}{68462}I thought I noticed it before.|2.98.
{68463}{68507}Looks like|an exceptional bargain.
{68508}{68555}WOMAN: Yes, it does. Thank you.
{68556}{68599}SALESMAN: Not at all.
{68804}{68854}Why didn't one of you|think of this idea?
{68855}{68938}It's the greatest|goodwill policy I ever heard of.
{68938}{68985}Every shopper|in New York City...
{68986}{69059}suddenly thinks of Macy|as a benevolent soul...
{69060}{69132}thinking only of the welfare|of the public.
{69133}{69177}And what does that make Gimbel?
{69178}{69225}Nothing but a profiteering|moneygrubber.
{69226}{69273}Two can play at this game.
{69274}{69345}From now on, if we haven't got|what the customer wants...
{69346}{69381}send him back to Macy's.
{69382}{69440}And what's more, we'll do|the same thing in our stores...
{69441}{69504}in Philadelphia,|Milwaukee, and Pittsburgh.
{69505}{69552}Get to work on it right away.
{69599}{69664}MACY: So, Gimbel's doing it|in Philadelphia...
{69665}{69705}Pittsburgh, and Milwaukee, eh?
{69706}{69741}MAN: And very successfully.
{69742}{69791}MACY: Well, we can cover|the country, too.
{69792}{69840}Notify our stores|in San Francisco...
{69841}{69924}Atlanta, Toledo, and Newark|to get going right away.
{69925}{69960}MEN: All right, Mr. Macy.
{69989}{70064}- Look this way, Mr. Gimbel.|- Hold it, Mr. Gimbel.
{70064}{70106}One more.
{70107}{70150}That's fine.
{70151}{70208}GIMBEL: Now we'll take some|at my store.
{70209}{70244}MACY: Just a minute.
{70245}{70327}I have something I'd like|to give our friend here.
{70328}{70423}This is a little something|to show my appreciation...
{70423}{70451}for all you've done.
{70452}{70505}KRIS: Thank you, Mr. Macy.
{70506}{70576}Ooh! That's very kind of you.
{70577}{70651}I didn't think|you were that generous.
{70652}{70699}That's a bit of money.
{70700}{70747}What are you going|to do with it?
{70748}{70836}Well, I have a friend.
{70837}{70904}A doctor.|He's been very kind to me.
{70905}{70952}He needs an x-ray machine.
{70953}{71010}MACY: I don't think|that's going to be enough.
{71014}{71076}GIMBEL:|I'll make up the difference.
{71077}{71125}MACY: Buy it through the store.|Get 10% discount.
{71125}{71183}I can get it for cost.
{71333}{71375}CLEO: Good night, Susan.
{71376}{71417}SUZIE: Good night, Cleo.
{71418}{71500}KRIS: Like me to sing you|a good night song?
{71502}{71549}SUZIE: If you want to.
{71550}{71621}KRIS: Doesn't your mother|ever sing to you at night?
{71622}{71687}SUZIE: Uh-uh. Why should she?
{71688}{71804}Oh, no reason.|I just think it's kind of nice.
{71805}{71884}- Do you like "Market"?|- All right.
{71885}{71982}[Singing] To market, to market|to buy a fat pig
{71983}{72060}Home again, home again,|jiggidy jig

{72144}{72236}Home again, home again,|jiggidy...
{72348}{72406}Amazing.
{72406}{72458}Do you happen|to have a spare piece?
{72459}{72490}SUZIE: Mm-hmm.
{72731}{72775}Well, here goes.
{72945}{72973}[Loud pop]
{73044}{73108}Oh!
{73483}{73528}- Hello, Alfred.|- Hello, Kris.
{73528}{73595}KRIS: How about a game|of checkers after lunch?
{73596}{73671}ALFRED: Leave us not today.|I don't feel like it.
{73672}{73716}KRIS: Oh? What's the matter?
{73716}{73758}ALFRED: Nothing. Nothing.
{73759}{73822}KRIS: Something is wrong.|What is it?
{73860}{73928}ALFRED: Well,|remember I was telling you...
{73928}{74008}how I like to play Santa|at the "Y" on Christmas...
{74009}{74064}and give out packages|to the young kids?
{74065}{74124}I was telling that|to Mr. Sawyer, see...
{74125}{74193}and he says that's very bad.
{74194}{74235}KRIS: Sawyer. You mean, uh...
{74236}{74307}ALFRED: That's the one.|He's a psychologist.
{74308}{74379}KRIS: Ohh,|that's a debatable poin...
{74380}{74425}Why is it bad, does he say?
{74425}{74535}ALFRED: He says guys who dress|like Santa Claus, see...
{74536}{74571}and give presents away...
{74572}{74619}do it because|when they was young...
{74620}{74655}they must have|did something bad...
{74656}{74690}and they feel guilty about it.
{74691}{74742}So now they do something|they think is good...
{74743}{74773}to make up for it.
{74774}{74841}It's what he calls|a guilt complex.
{74894}{74936}KRIS: How old are you, Alfred?
{74937}{74973}ALFRED: Seventeen.
{74974}{75026}KRIS: Seventeen.
{75027}{75090}Doesn't seem you've had time|to be guilty of anything...
{75091}{75127}except overeating.
{75128}{75182}It's nothing to laugh about.
{75183}{75233}It's pretty serious, he says.
{75234}{75288}It's a lot of rubbish, Alfred.|Don't listen.
{75289}{75337}Oh, he knows|what he's talking about.
{75338}{75405}He's been studying that stuff|for a long time.
{75406}{75494}KRIS: Well, what's the basis|of this guilt complex...
{75495}{75534}you're supposed to have?
{75535}{75571}Does he say that?
{75572}{75650}Well, he ain't found out yet.
{75651}{75733}It's probably way down|inside of me someplace, see?
{75734}{75811}Maybe something that happened|when I was a baby, he says.
{75812}{75886}It takes time,|but he'll do it, he says.
{75887}{75955}KRIS: You mean|you're going to him again?
{75956}{76030}ALFRED: Sure.|I go every day after lunch.
{76031}{76087}Oh, he don't soak me nothin'.
{76088}{76175}He's doing it for free|'cause I'm an interesting case.
{76176}{76205}KRIS: Yes.
{76206}{76275}What else has he found|wrong with you, Alfred?
{76301}{76346}Anything else?
{76347}{76421}No. Oh, just|that I hate my father.
{76422}{76493}I didn't know it,|but he says I do.
{76494}{76550}And he sees you every day?
{76551}{76634}Yeah. I say anything|that comes into my head.
{76635}{76680}Excuse me, Alfred.
{76681}{76720}A few things|have just come into my head...
{76721}{76759}and I'm going to say them.
{77035}{77078}SAWYER:|Why are you busting in here?
{77079}{77129}KRIS:|Are you a licensed psychiatrist?
{77130}{77182}SAWYER:|What business is it of yours?
{77183}{77231}KRIS: I have great respect|for psychiatry...
{77233}{77304}and great contempt for amateurs|who go around practicing it.
{77305}{77352}You have no more right|to analyze Alfred...
{77353}{77408}than a dentist has|to remove a gallbladder!
{77409}{77440}SAWYER: I beg your pardon.
{77440}{77519}KRIS: Your job here, I gather,|is to give intelligence tests.
{77520}{77565}Passing yourself off|as a psychologist.
{77566}{77619}You ought to be horsewhipped...
{77620}{77674}taking a normal, impressionable|boy like Alfred...
{77675}{77718}and filling him with complexes.
{77719}{77774}SAWYER: I'm better equipped|to judge that than you are.
{77775}{77831}KRIS: Just because the boy|wants to be kind to children...
{77831}{77879}you tell him|he has a guilt complex.
{77880}{77921}SAWYER: Sharing his delusion,|you couldn't understand.
{77922}{77978}Alfred's definitely maladjusted,|and I'm helping.
{77979}{78014}KRIS: Maladjusted?!|You talk about maladjusted.
{78015}{78071}It seems to me the patient|is running the clinic here.
{78072}{78130}SAWYER: I won't stand...|Leave this office immediately.
{78131}{78183}KRIS: Now either|you stop analyzing Alfred...
{78184}{78219}or I go straight to Mr. Macy...
{78220}{78274}and tell him what a contemptible|fraud you are.
{78275}{78315}SAWYER:|Leave or I'll call security.
{78316}{78410}KRIS: There's only one way|to handle a man like you.
{78410}{78468}You won't listen to reason.|You're heartless.
{78469}{78495}You have no humanity.
{78496}{78549}SAWYER: Are you going to leave?
{78550}{78579}KRIS: Yes.
{78799}{78830}- Kris.|- Mr. Sawyer!
{78831}{78891}DORIS: Mr. Sawyer,|are you all right?
{78891}{78920}SHELLHAMMER: Look at that bump!
{78921}{78950}Mr. Sawyer...|He's unconscious!
{78951}{78997}Better get a wet towel.
{78998}{79032}DORIS: No, better get a doctor.
{79033}{79093}DORIS: You must have done|something to him.
{79094}{79141}I tell you|we were merely talking...
{79142}{79219}but when I mentioned Santa Claus|and attacked his delusion...
{79219}{79248}he became violent.
{79249}{79309}I told you he had|latent maniacal tendencies.
{79310}{79357}Well, I think this proves it.
{79358}{79417}SHELLHAMMER: Have Dr. Pierce|give him another examination.
{79418}{79445}SAWYER: Dr. Pierce...
{79446}{79500}He doesn't know anything|about this sort of thing.
{79501}{79537}He's a general practitioner.
{79538}{79585}SHELLHAMMER: You must admit|this is rather serious.
{79586}{79620}Perhaps we'd better get|a competent psychiatrist.
{79621}{79681}DORIS: But he's taken dozens|of those examinations...
{79682}{79717}and passed them all 100%.
{79717}{79782}SAWYER: It's possible|his condition has changed.
{79783}{79837}SHELLHAMMER: I don't think|we can take any chances.
{79838}{79885}I can't see any harm in it.
{79886}{79946}If he passes the test,|he can return to work at once...
{79947}{80005}and if he doesn't,|it's better if we find out.
{80006}{80064}SAWYER: You better have|the examination right away...
{80065}{80137}before he tells Mr. Ma...|before Mr. Macy finds out.
{80137}{80164}SHELLHAMMER: Oh, my, yes.
{80166}{80233}You explain to Mr. Kringle.|After all, you're his friend.
{80233}{80296}DORIS: I won't do it.|I've grown very fond of him.
{80297}{80377}This would be like telling him|I thought he was insane.
{80378}{80436}SAWYER: You don't call this|acting normal, do you?
{80437}{80473}DORIS: Of course I don't...
{80474}{80531}but there are thousands|of elderly who aren't normal.
{80532}{80604}This will hurt Kris deeply,|and I don't want to do it!
{80792}{80839}SHELLHAMMER:|That wouldn't be fair to him.
{80840}{80875}I'll tell him the truth.
{80876}{80927}I believe in being truthful|with people.
{80929}{80983}SAWYER: If he sees me|or you mention psychiatrist...
{80984}{81047}it's more or less attacking|his delusion again.
{81048}{81083}He's apt to become violent.
{81084}{81119}SHELLHAMMER:|But in front of the children?
{81120}{81155}Oh, that would be terrible.
{81156}{81223}SAWYER: Get him out of the store|on some other pretext.
{81224}{81275}Then once outside,|I'll explain it to him.
{81276}{81324}SHELLHAMMER: If you think|it's better that way.
{81361}{81430}CLERK: Keep a straight line.|All day long to see Santa Claus.
{81492}{81523}Oh!
{81588}{81619}- Mr. Kringle.|- Yes?

{81708}{81775}this afternoon|down at the city hall...
{81776}{81803}you and the mayor.
{81804}{81840}KRIS: Good. Like to meet him.
{81840}{81897}A few things|I'd like to discuss with him.
{81898}{81982}Oh, but I made an appointment|with Mr. Macy at 4:00.
{81982}{82029}I want to tell him|about something.
{82030}{82090}SHELLHAMMER: You'll be back|in plenty of time.
{82091}{82125}There's a car waiting|downstairs.
{82126}{82172}It's starting to drizzle.|You'll need a coat.
{82173}{82200}I'll get it.
{82201}{82236}KRIS: Thanks. Be right with you.
{82237}{82306}I just want to take care|of a few kiddies first.
{82307}{82342}SHELLHAMMER: All right.

{84159}{84230}He's going to be with us|for a few days...

{84302}{84385}Yes, in view|of his examination...

{84489}{84536}Yes, I know, Mr. Gailey...

{85184}{85253}GAILEY: Why'd you do it, Kris?
{85254}{85325}You deliberately failed|that examination, didn't you?
{85373}{85404}Why?
{85405}{85501}KRIS: Because the last few days|I've had great hope.
{85502}{85586}I had a feeling Doris was|beginning to believe in me.
{85587}{85669}And now I find out she was just|humoring me all the time.
{85670}{85705}GAILEY: I just telephoned her.
{85706}{85771}She didn't know anything about|taking pictures with the mayor.
{85772}{85819}That was Sawyer's idea.
{85820}{85860}KRIS: Well, I'm glad of that.
{85861}{85946}But why didn't she come to me|and explain the whole thing?
{85947}{86006}GAILEY:|She didn't want to hurt you.

{86084}{86119}GAILEY: That's not true.
{86120}{86165}KRIS: Yes, it is.|She had doubts.
{86166}{86196}That's why she was just sorry.
{86197}{86243}If you'd been dragged off here|instead of me...
{86244}{86282}she wouldn't have been sorry.

{89655}{89700}The man calls himself|Kris Kringle...
{89701}{89742}thinks he's Santa Claus.
{89743}{89774}Uh-oh.
{89809}{89836}[Knock on door]
{89837}{89868}Come in.
{89895}{89949}Mr. Gailey to see you,|Your Honor.
{89950}{89981}He represents Mr. Kringle.
{90016}{90049}Better show him in.
{90117}{90149}GAILEY: Good morning.
{90150}{90212}Your Honor, there seems to be|undue haste in this case.
{90213}{90271}I wish to protect my client's|rights, as I'm sure you do.
{90272}{90299}HARPER: Of course.
{90300}{90352}GAILEY:|I request a formal hearing...
{90353}{90392}to which I may bring witnesses.
{90393}{90457}- This is cut and dried?|- That's what I was told.
{90458}{90503}I didn't know anything|about a protest.
{90504}{90573}GAILEY: Of course, you may sign|the commitment papers now...
{90574}{90613}but I'll bring|a habeas corpus later.
{90614}{90673}There's no point in signing.
{90674}{90786}We'll have a hearing|on Monday morning at 10:00.
{90787}{90835}GAILEY: Thank you. Good day.
{90948}{90984}Thank you.
{91106}{91137}SAWYER: That man...
{91137}{91212}I heard him say something|about Mr. Kringle before.
{91213}{91249}Who is he?
{91250}{91284}MARRAH: His name is Gailey,|Kringle's lawyer.
{91285}{91357}Probably grabbed the case|to get some cheap publicity.
{91357}{91429}SAWYER: We can't have that.|Mr. Macy would rather drop this.
{91429}{91465}MARRAH: It can't be done.|It's too late now.
{91465}{91525}Kringle has been examined by|city hospital psychiatrists.
{91526}{91563}It has to follow due process.
{91564}{91611}SAWYER: We must avoid publicity.
{91612}{91648}I, uh... Oh.
{91859}{91923}SAWYER: Mr. Gailey,|I represent Mr. Macy.
{91924}{91957}My name's Sawyer.
{91958}{91993}GAILEY: Oh, so you're Sawyer.
{91994}{92043}SAWYER: Yes.|Regarding this Kringle matter...
{92044}{92095}We're very anxious|to avoid any publicity.
{92096}{92125}GAILEY: Naturally.
{92126}{92203}SAWYER: So if you would agree|to put this through quietly...
{92204}{92282}we'd surely find a generous way|to express our appreciation.
{92283}{92310}GAILEY: Very interesting.
{92311}{92354}SAWYER: Then you'll cooperate?
{92355}{92423}GAILEY: Very interesting.|Publicity. Hmm.
{92424}{92466}That's not a bad idea.
{92467}{92511}If I'm going to win this case...
{92512}{92567}I'll have to have plenty|of public opinion.
{92567}{92623}And publicity's|just the way to do it.
{92679}{92738}Thanks, Mr. Sawyer.
{92739}{92826}SAWYER:|Oh, Mr. Gailey, wait a minute.
{92827}{92887}Mr. Gailey, one moment, please!
{93494}{93561}HARPER: I don't see what|they're making a fuss about.
{93562}{93597}After all, he's an old man.
{93598}{93645}CHARLEY:|How've you been feeling lately?
{93646}{93685}You look a little run-down.
{93686}{93757}HARPER: Me? Why, I feel fine.|Never better.
{93758}{93817}CHARLEY: Why not see the doc?|Take a few weeks off.
{93817}{93889}Go fishing, go hunting.|Go anyplace.
{93890}{93937}HARPER: Why should I?
{93938}{93985}CHARLEY: Because|this Kringle case is dynamite.
{93986}{94058}Let some judge handle it that|isn't coming up for reelection.
{94059}{94092}HARPER: I can't do that.
{94093}{94129}CHARLEY:|I'm no legal brain trust.
{94130}{94198}I don't know|a habeas from a corpus.
{94199}{94257}But I do know politics.|That's my racket.
{94258}{94298}I got you elected, didn't I?
{94298}{94349}And I'm gonna try|to get you reelected.
{94350}{94441}HARPER: I appreciate everything|that you've done for me.
{94442}{94485}CHARLEY: Then get off this case.
{94485}{94521}HARPER: But why?
{94522}{94599}CHARLEY: You're a Pontius Pilate|the minute you start.
{94600}{94662}Oh, I don't believe it.
{94663}{94701}I'm an honest man...
{94702}{94749}and nobody's going|to hold it against me...
{94750}{94796}for doing my duty as I see it.

{94972}{95007}Good night, Alice.
{95008}{95043}Now, straight to bed.
{95044}{95102}I promised your mother|you'd be in bed by 8:00...

{95131}{95174}ALICE: Aren't you coming, too?
{95175}{95237}MRS. HARPER: I'll be up soon|to tuck you in. Now, scoot!
{95238}{95345}How about a great big kiss|for Grandpa, hmm?
{95397}{95423}ALICE: Hmmph!
{95424}{95452}TERRY: Hmmph!
{95476}{95536}HARPER: Fine way|to treat their grandfather!
{95537}{95576}No hug, no kiss, no anything.
{95577}{95611}MRS. HARPER: I don't blame them.

{95705}{95750}CHARLEY: See what I mean?
{95877}{95916}POLICEMAN: Hey.
{96294}{96322}KRIS: Don't worry about me.
{96323}{96367}I've got the best lawyer|in the world.
{96368}{96410}SAWYER: How long do you think|this will take?
{96411}{96440}MARRAH: Maybe a week.
{96441}{96482}SAWYER:|A week?! That seems impossible!
{96483}{96530}MARRAH: That lawyer|won't be stupid enough...
{96531}{96593}to let him admit anything.|He'll deny everything.
{96594}{96643}I'll bring witnesses,|and he'll bring witnesses.

{97078}{97161}I'd like to call|the first witness.
{97162}{97246}Mr. Kringle,|will you take the stand?
{97531}{97566}KRIS: Good morning, Your Honor.
{97567}{97615}BAILIFF:|You do solemnly swear...
{97616}{97710}the testimony you'll give|shall be the whole truth...
{97710}{97758}so help you God?
{97759}{97787}KRIS: I do.
{97787}{97861}HARPER: Before you begin, I want|to explain to the witness...
{97862}{97903}this is a hearing, not a trial.
{97904}{97940}Mr. Kringle...
{97942}{97998}you don't have to answer|against your wishes...
{97999}{98062}or even testify at all.
{98063}{98105}We have no objection,|Your Honor.
{98147}{98205}I'll be glad to answer|any questions I can.
{98254}{98302}What is your name?
{98302}{98330}Kris Kringle.
{98370}{98405}Where do you live?
{98405}{98465}That's what this hearing|will decide.
{98466}{98518}[Audience laughing]
{98519}{98559}[Gavel pounding]
{98600}{98661}A very sound answer,|Mr. Kringle.
{98705}{98757}MARRAH: Do you believe|that you're Santa Claus?
{98758}{98798}KRIS: Of course.
{98926}{98986}The state rests, Your Honor.
{99171}{99206}Well, Mr. Gailey...
{99207}{99266}do you wish to cross-examine|the witness?
{99267}{99319}I believe he was employed|to play Santa Claus.
{99320}{99382}Perhaps he didn't understand|the question correctly.
{99383}{99446}Oh, I understood perfectly,|Your Honor.
{99548}{99608}No further questions|at this time.
{99692}{99730}Thank you.
{99812}{99851}HARPER:|In view of this statement...
{99852}{99923}do you still wish|to put in a defense?
{99924}{99971}GAILEY: I do, Your Honor.
{99972}{100051}I'm fully aware|of my client's opinions.
{100052}{100083}That's the entire case|against him.
{100084}{100169}All these complicated tests|boil down to this:
{100170}{100222}Mr. Kringle is not sane...
{100223}{100267}because he believes himself|to be Santa Claus.
{100267}{100299}An entirely logical...
{100300}{100362}and reasonable assumption,|I'm afraid.
{100363}{100443}It would be if the clerk,|Mr. Marrah, or I...
{100444}{100481}believed we were Santa Claus.
{100482}{100546}Anyone who thinks|he's Santa Claus is not sane.
{100547}{100584}GAILEY: Not necessarily.
{100585}{100644}You believe yourself|to be Judge Harper...
{100645}{100723}yet no one questions your sanity|because you are Judge Harper.
{100724}{100788}I know all about myself,|young man.
{100789}{100832}Mr. Kringle is the subject|of this hearing.
{100833}{100861}GAILEY: Yes, Your Honor...
{100862}{100933}and if he is the person|he believes himself to be...
{100934}{101009}just as you are,|then he's just as sane.
{101010}{101038}Granted, but he isn't.
{101039}{101065}GAILEY: Oh, but he is.
{101066}{101109}HARPER: Is what?
{101111}{101182}I intend to prove|that Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus.
{101225}{101275}MARRAH: He's crazy, too!
{101276}{101324}[Gavel banging]
{101509}{101538}[Doorbell buzzes]
{101538}{101573}[Doorbell buzzes]
{101574}{101632}GAILEY: Hi, darling.
{101633}{101701}Sorry I'm late. Get your coat.|I reserved our table at Luigi's.
{101702}{101729}We're gonna celebrate.
{101730}{101765}DORIS: What are we celebrating?
{101765}{101824}GAILEY: Read all about it.|"Gailey Throws Court Bombshell."
{101825}{101872}DORIS: Yes, I read that.
{101873}{101944}GAILEY: I didn't see this...|Front page! Good. Good.
{101945}{101992}DORIS:|You're not serious about this?
{101992}{102027}GAILEY: Of course I am.
{102028}{102088}DORIS: But you can't possibly|prove he's Santa Claus.
{102088}{102148}GAILEY: Why not? You saw Macy|and Gimbel shaking hands.
{102149}{102208}That wasn't possible either,|but it happened.
{102209}{102243}It's the best defense I can use.
{102244}{102304}Completely logical|and completely unexpected.
{102305}{102340}DORIS: And completely idiotic.
{102341}{102376}What about your bosses...
{102376}{102420}Haislip and Mackenzie|and the rest?
{102421}{102447}What do they say?
{102448}{102495}GAILEY: That I'm jeopardizing|the prestige and dignity...
{102496}{102543}of an old, established|law firm...
{102544}{102604}and either I drop this|impossible case immediately...
{102604}{102639}or they will drop me.
{102640}{102677}I beat them to it. I quit.
{102678}{102713}DORIS: Fred, you didn't.
{102714}{102766}GAILEY: Of course I did.|I can't let Kris down.
{102767}{102833}He needs me,|and all the rest of us need him.
{102834}{102876}DORIS: Darling,|he's a nice old man...
{102877}{102970}and I admire you|for wanting to help him...
{102971}{103031}but you've got to be realistic|and face facts.
{103031}{103078}You can't just|throw your career away...
{103079}{103120}because of a sentimental whim.
{103121}{103168}GAILEY: But I'm not|throwing my career away.
{103169}{103216}DORIS:|If Haislip feels that way...
{103217}{103264}so will every other law firm.
{103265}{103323}GAILEY: I'm sure they will.|I'll open my own office.
{103324}{103383}DORIS:|What kind of cases will you get?
{103384}{103455}GAILEY: Probably people like|Kris who are being bullied.
{103456}{103503}That's the only fun in law|anyway.
{103504}{103573}If you believe in me|and have faith in me...
{103574}{103617}everything will...
{103653}{103729}You don't have any faith in me,|do you?
{103730}{103818}It's not about faith.|It's just common sense.
{103862}{103914}Faith is believing in things...
{103915}{103982}when common sense|tells you not to.
{103983}{104044}It's not just Kris|that's on trial.
{104045}{104082}It's everything he stands for.
{104083}{104132}It's kindness, joy, love,|and all other intangibles.
{104132}{104177}DORIS: Fred,|you're talking like a child.
{104177}{104213}You're living|in a realistic world!
{104214}{104249}Those lovely intangibles|aren't worth much.
{104249}{104286}You don't get ahead that way.
{104287}{104354}GAILEY: That all depends|on what you call getting ahead.
{104355}{104402}Evidently,|we have different definitions.
{104403}{104461}DORIS: We've talked|about wonderful plans.
{104462}{104513}Then you go|on an idealistic binge.
{104514}{104581}You give up your job,|throw away your security...
{104582}{104658}and then you expect me|to be happy about it!
{104659}{104738}GAILEY: Yes,|I guess I expected too much.
{104739}{104789}Someday,|you're going to find out...
{104790}{104834}that your way of facing|this realistic world...
{104834}{104870}just doesn't work.
{104871}{104905}And when you do...
{104905}{104948}don't overlook|those lovely intangibles.
{104949}{104992}You'll discover|they're the only things...
{104993}{105025}that are worthwhile.
{105228}{105289}MARRAH: These reporters make me|look like a sadistic monster...
{105290}{105325}who likes to drown cats...
{105326}{105372}and tear the wings|off butterflies.
{105372}{105400}Why, this old man...
{105401}{105484}MRS. MARRAH: Tommy, go get|mother's scissors, will you?
{105485}{105533}They're in the bedroom.
{105533}{105581}That's a good boy.
{105615}{105675}I don't want to discuss|this case in front of him.
{105676}{105720}It'll break his heart.
{105721}{105769}While we're on the subject,|I agree with the reporters.
{105769}{105817}Mr. Kringle seems|to be a nice old man.
{105817}{105876}I don't see why you have|to keep persecuting him.
{105877}{105924}MARRAH: Firstly,|I am not persecuting him.
{105925}{105960}I am prosecuting him.
{105961}{106024}And secondly,|I like the old man, too.
{106025}{106080}I wish|I'd never gotten into this.
{106081}{106140}But it's too late now. There's|nothing I can do about it.
{106141}{106189}It's up to the state|of New York.
{106189}{106224}I'm their duly appointed|legal representative.
{106225}{106272}Kringle has been declared|a menace to society...
{106273}{106312}by competent doctors.
{106313}{106366}It's my duty to protect|the state of New York...
{106367}{106406}and see that he's put away.
{106407}{106453}No matter what they say|about me...
{106453}{106491}I've got to do it.
{106492}{106570}Sometimes I wish I'd married|a butcher or a plumber.
{106571}{106634}MARRAH: Well, my dear,|if I lose this case...
{106635}{106690}it's very possible|that you'll get your wish.
{106980}{107013}Hello, Kris.

{108112}{108193}MARRAH: Do you really believe|he's Santa Claus?
{108393}{108430}MACY: I do.
{108431}{108458}MARRAH: You do?
{108459}{108494}GAILEY: That's all.
{108495}{108527}[Gavel pounding]
{108798}{108838}MACY: Psychologist!
{108839}{108913}Where'd you graduate from,|a correspondence school?
{108938}{108974}You're fired.
{109016}{109065}Your Honor,|I object to this testimony.
{109066}{109113}It's ridiculous, irrelevant,|and immaterial.
{109114}{109165}Mr. Gailey is making|a circus of this court.
{109166}{109208}There is no such person|as Santa Claus...
{109209}{109243}and everybody knows it.
{109244}{109304}GAILEY: I submit|it's purely a matter of opinion.
{109305}{109361}Can Mr. Marrah disprove|Santa's existence?
{109362}{109403}MARRAH: No. I don't intend to.
{109404}{109463}This isn't a nursery. It's the|New York State Supreme Court.
{109464}{109523}I'll not waste this court's time|with such nonsense!
{109524}{109571}GAILEY: Mr. Marrah seems to have|appointed himself judge.
{109572}{109642}He's ruling on what testimony|I may introduce.
{109643}{109710}MARRAH: We request an immediate|ruling from this court.
{109711}{109772}Is there or is there not|a Santa Claus?
{109823}{109859}Well...
{109859}{109903}CHARLEY: Ahem!
{110040}{110122}The court will take a recess|to consider the matter.
{110193}{110264}I don't care what you do|with old whisker puss...
{110265}{110323}but if you rule|that there's no Santa Claus...
{110324}{110383}you better start looking|for that chicken farm.

{110686}{110734}CHARLEY: Why don't you...
{110770}{110805}All right.
{110805}{110889}Tell them the New York|State Supreme Court rules...
{110890}{110925}there's no Santa Claus.
{110926}{110955}It's all over the papers.
{110956}{111009}The kids don't hang up|their stockings.
{111010}{111065}Now, what happens|to all the toys...
{111065}{111116}that are supposed to be|in those stockings?
{111117}{111152}Nobody buys them.
{111153}{111212}The toy manufacturers|are going to like that.
{111213}{111289}So they have to lay off|a lot of their employees...
{111290}{111337}union employees.
{111338}{111426}Now you got the C.I.O.|And the A.F.L. Against you.
{111427}{111487}And they're gonna adore you|for it.
{111490}{111564}And they're gonna say it|with votes.
{111565}{111635}And the department stores|will love you, too...
{111636}{111699}and the Christmas card makers...
{111700}{111735}and the candy companies.
{111736}{111851}Oh, Henry, you're going to be|an awful popular fellow.
{111852}{111908}And what about|the Salvation Army?
{111909}{111969}Why, they got a Santa Claus|on every corner...
{111971}{112010}and they take in a fortune.
{112011}{112043}But you go ahead, Henry.
{112044}{112097}You do it your way.
{112098}{112158}You go on back in there|and tell them...
{112159}{112232}that you rule|there's no Santa Claus.
{112256}{112313}But if you do, remember this:
{112314}{112358}You can count on getting|just two votes...
{112359}{112425}your own and that|district attorney's out there.

{113200}{113249}The question of Santa Claus...
{113250}{113304}seems to be largely|a matter of opinion.
{113305}{113374}Many people|firmly believe in him.
{113375}{113422}Others do not.

{117181}{117228}personal opinion as evidence.
{117229}{117297}We could bring witnesses|with opposite opinions...
{117298}{117353}but we desire|to shorten this hearing...
{117354}{117397}rather than prolong it.
{117398}{117446}I request that Mr. Gailey...

{117483}{117521}that Mr. Kringle...
{117522}{117584}is the one-and-only Santa Claus.
{117615}{117660}Your point's well taken.
{117661}{117725}I'm afraid we must agree.

{117938}{117992}on the basis|of competent authority?
{118033}{118080}Not at this time, Your Honor.
{118081}{118143}I ask for an adjournment|until tomorrow.

{118670}{118741}They're having a trial|about him.
{118741}{118788}SUZIE: You mean like for murder?
{118789}{118836}DORIS: No, it isn't that kind|of a trial.
{118837}{118897}It's just because|he says he's Santa Claus.
{118898}{118970}SUZIE: I've got a feeling|he is Santa Claus.
{118971}{119041}DORIS: Some people don't|believe that. That's why...

{119114}{119173}He's not like anyone else.
{119173}{119221}He must be Santa.
{119221}{119275}DORIS: I think|perhaps you're right, Suzie.
{119276}{119351}SUZIE: Is Mr. Kringle sad now,|Mother?
{119352}{119399}DORIS: I'm afraid he is.
{119400}{119460}I'm sure he misses you.
{119461}{119548}SUZIE: Then I'll write him|a letter and cheer him up.
{121272}{121327}WORKER: Hey, Lou, come here!
{121328}{121355}LOU: Yeah?
{121356}{121391}WORKER: Here's a new one.

{123310}{123406}GAILEY: Kris, I'm afraid|I've got bad news for you.
{123407}{123490}I've tried every way to get|some competent authority.
{123491}{123545}I've wired the governor,|the mayor. I even...
{123546}{123591}KRIS:|This is worth more to me...
{123592}{123648}than all the governors|and mayors in the world.
{123649}{123700}MARRAH:|It's all over. Look at him.
{123701}{123745}He hasn't got a thing.
{124138}{124214}MARRAH: And furthermore,|the defense has yet to offer...
{124215}{124274}one concrete|piece of evidence...
{124275}{124335}to substantiate|this preposterous claim.
{124335}{124411}Not one authoritative proof|that this man is Santa Claus.
{124412}{124442}In view of these facts...
{124443}{124502}and especially since|today is Christmas Eve...
{124503}{124567}we're, naturally,|all anxious to get home...
{124568}{124615}I ask that you sign|the commitment papers...
{124616}{124645}without further delay.
{124646}{124699}Mr. Gailey...
{124700}{124759}have you anything further|to offer?
{124759}{124795}Yes, I have, Your Honor.
{124796}{124868}I'd like to submit the following|facts in evidence.
{124869}{124913}It concerns|the Post Office Department...
{124914}{124996}an official agency|of the United States government.
{124997}{125057}"The Post Office Department|was created...
{125058}{125105}"by the Second|Continental Congress...
{125106}{125140}"on July 26, 1776.
{125141}{125207}"The first postmaster general|was Benjamin Franklin.
{125208}{125249}"The Post Office...
{125250}{125314}"is one of the world's|largest business concerns.
{125315}{125362}"Last year,|under Robert Hannigan...
{125363}{125508}"it did a gross business|of $1,112,877,174."
{125509}{125579}We're all gratified to know...
{125580}{125627}the Post Office|is doing nicely...
{125628}{125690}but it hardly has|any bearing on this case.
{125691}{125766}It has a great deal, Your Honor,|if I may be allowed to proceed.
{125766}{125828}By all means, Mr. Gailey.
{125863}{125932}Your Honor, the figures|I have just quoted...
{125933}{126006}indicate an efficiently run|organization.
{126007}{126081}United States postal laws|and regulations...
{126082}{126160}make it a criminal offense|to willfully misdirect mail...
{126161}{126225}or intentionally deliver it|to the wrong party.
{126226}{126256}Consequently...
{126257}{126309}the Department uses|every possible precaution.
{126310}{126438}The state of New York|admires the Post Office.
{126439}{126494}It is efficient, authoritative,|and prosperous.
{126495}{126570}We're happy to concede|Mr. Gailey's claims.
{126571}{126603}GAILEY: For the record?
{126604}{126673}MARRAH: For the record.|Anything to get this case going.
{126674}{126717}GAILEY: Then I want|to introduce this evidence.
{126718}{126774}I'll take them, please.
{126775}{126873}GAILEY: I have three letters|addressed simply "Santa Claus."
{126874}{126909}No other address whatsoever.
{126910}{126984}Yet these were just now|delivered to Mr. Kringle...
{126985}{127049}by bona fide employees|of the Post Office.
{127050}{127104}I offer them|as positive proof that...
{127105}{127189}MARRAH: Uh, three letters|are hardly positive proof.
{127190}{127279}I understand the Post Office|receives thousands of these.
{127280}{127362}GAILEY: I have further exhibits,|but I hesitate to produce them.
{127364}{127411}MARRAH:|We'll be very happy to see them.
{127412}{127459}Yes, yes.|Produce them, Mr. Gailey.
{127460}{127510}Put them here on my desk.
{127511}{127559}But, Your Honor...
{127560}{127605}HARPER:|Put them here on the desk.

{135353}{135444}I believe. I believe.
{135528}{135584}Stop, Uncle Fred! Stop!
{135584}{135632}Stop! Stop!
{135719}{135748}DORIS: Suzie!
{135773}{135801}Suzie!
{135853}{135892}Suzie, where are you going?
{135893}{135929}GAILEY: What is she doing?
{135930}{135978}- Suzie!|- Suzie!
{136033}{136091}GAILEY: Suzie, where are you?
{136092}{136126}SUZIE: I'm upstairs!
{136127}{136174}DORIS: You shouldn't run around|in other people's houses.
{136175}{136210}You know better than that.
{136211}{136307}SUZIE: But this is my house,|the one I asked Mr. Kringle for.
{136308}{136351}It is! I know it is!
{136352}{136422}My room upstairs is like|I knew it would be!
{136423}{136451}You were right, Mommy.
{136452}{136550}Mommy said if things|don't turn out right at first...
{136551}{136600}you've still got to believe.
{136601}{136647}I kept believing.|You were right, Mommy!
{136648}{136705}Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus!
{136706}{136748}DORIS: Where are you going?
{136749}{136785}SUZIE:|To see if there's a swing!
{136818}{136864}There is one! There is one!
{136978}{137026}GAILEY: You told her that?
{137241}{137329}The sign outside|said it's for sale.
{137330}{137371}We can't let her down.
{137416}{137462}DORIS:|I never really doubted you.
{137463}{137528}It was just|my silly common sense.
{137529}{137601}GAILEY: It even makes sense|to believe in me now.
{137601}{137661}I must be a pretty good lawyer.
{137661}{137697}I take a little old man...
{137698}{137745}and legally prove|that he's Santa Claus.
{137746}{137781}Now, you know that...
{138032}{138091}DORIS: Oh, no. It can't be.
{138092}{138155}It must have been left|by the people that moved out.
{138180}{138208}GAILEY: Maybe.
{138238}{138343}Maybe I didn't do such|a wonderful thing after all.
