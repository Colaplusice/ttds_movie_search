1
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:12,519
I shall never forget
the weekend Laura died.

2
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:18,322
A silver sun burned through the sky
like a huge magnifying glass.

3
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:22,624
It was the hottest Sunday
in my recollection.

4
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,728
I felt as if I were the only human being
left in New York.

5
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,031
For with Laura's
horrible death, I was alone.

6
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:36,434
I, Waldo Lydecker...

7
00:01:36,535 --> 00:01:39,537
was the only one
who really knew her...

8
00:01:41,138 --> 00:01:45,240
and I had just begun
to write Laura's story when...

9
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:48,543
another of those detectives
came to see me.

10
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:51,645
I had him wait.

11
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:57,548
I could watch him
through the half-open door.

12
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:14,061
I noted that his attention
was fixed upon my clock.

13
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:17,664
There was only one other
in existence...

14
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,365
and that was
in Laura's apartment...

15
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:23,367
in the very room
where she was murdered.

16
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,472
Careful there.
That stuff is priceless.

17
00:02:31,674 --> 00:02:33,574
Come in here, please.

18
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,280
Mr. Lydecker?

19
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:44,782
Ah, you recognize me.
How splendid.

20
00:02:44,882 --> 00:02:46,884
Sit down, please.

21
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:52,187
Nice little place
you have here, Mr. Lydecker.

22
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,390
It's lavish,
but I call it home.

23
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,592
I suppose you're here
about the Laura Hunt murder.

24
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:00,893
Yesterday morning,
after Laura's body was found...

25
00:03:00,993 --> 00:03:04,296
I was questioned
by Sergeants McAvity and Schultz...

26
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:06,298
and I stated...

27
00:03:06,497 --> 00:03:09,600
"On Friday night, Laura had a dinner
engagement with me...

28
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:13,002
"after which she was ostensibly
going out of town.

29
00:03:13,103 --> 00:03:17,306
"She phoned and canceled
our engagement at exactly 7:00.

30
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,306
- After that I-"
- You "ate a lonely dinner...

31
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,709
then got into the tub to read."

32
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,710
Why did you
write it down?

33
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,912
Afraid you'd forget it?

34
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:30,615
I am the most widely
misquoted man in America.

35
00:03:30,714 --> 00:03:33,216
When my friends do it,
I resent it.

36
00:03:33,316 --> 00:03:36,718
From Sergeants McAvity and Schultz,
I should find it intolerable.

37
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:39,520
Hand me that washcloth,
please, Mr.--

38
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,822
Mr.--

39
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,824
McPherson.

40
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,626
McPherson. McPherson.

41
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,529
Mark McPherson--
the siege of Babylon, Long Island.

42
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:52,029
The gangster with the machine gun.
Killed three policemen.

43
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,531
I told the story over the air
and wrote a column about it.

44
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:56,633
Are you the one
with the leg full of lead...

45
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:59,034
- the man who walked right in and got him?
- Yeah.

46
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:01,836
Well, well.
Hand me my robe, please.

47
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,941
You have a pretty good memory,
Mr. Lydecker.

48
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,843
I always liked that detective
with the silver shinbone.

49
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:17,246
Thanks. I hope you won't have any reason
to change your mind about me.

50
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:20,250
- Have you any more questions?
- Yeah, just one.

51
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,851
Two years ago,
in your October 17 column...

52
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:25,053
you started out
to write a book review...

53
00:04:25,153 --> 00:04:28,755
but at the bottom of the column, you
switched over to the Harrington murder case.

54
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:33,058
Are the processes of the creative mind
now under the jurisdiction of the police?

55
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:37,862
You said Harrington was rubbed out with
a shotgun loaded with buckshot...

56
00:04:37,962 --> 00:04:40,664
the way Laura Hunt was murdered
night before last.

57
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,665
- Did I?
- Yeah.

58
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:45,767
But he was really killed
with a sash weight.

59
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:49,770
How ordinary.
My version was obviously superior.

60
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:51,871
I never bother
with details, you know.

61
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,874
I do. Well, so long.

62
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:58,376
Mind if I go with you?

63
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:01,878
- What for?
- Murder is my favorite crime.

64
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:04,080
I write about it regularly...

65
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,182
and I know you'll have to visit everyone
on your list of suspects.

66
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:10,384
I'd like to study
their reactions.

67
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:13,186
- You're on the list yourself, you know.
- Good.

68
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:16,788
To have overlooked me
would have been a pointed insult.

69
00:05:16,888 --> 00:05:20,591
You're not the sort of man
one would insult, Mr. Lydecker.

70
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:23,593
- Do you really suspect me?
- Yes.

71
00:05:23,693 --> 00:05:27,696
McPherson, if you know anything
about faces, look at mine.

72
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:33,400
How singularly innocent
I look this morning.

73
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:36,502
Have you ever seen
such candid eyes?

74
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:44,307
Something you confiscated
in a raid on a kindergarten?

75
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:48,611
Takes a lot of control.
Would you like to try it?

76
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,112
No, thanks.

77
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:53,913
Were you in love
with Laura Hunt, Mr. Lydecker?

78
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:58,917
Was she in love with you?

79
00:05:59,118 --> 00:06:01,419
Laura considered me
the wisest, the wittiest...

80
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,522
the most interesting man
she'd ever met.

81
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:07,324
I was in complete accord
with her on that point.

82
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:10,426
She thought me also
the kindest...

83
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:12,728
the gentlest...

84
00:06:12,828 --> 00:06:15,230
the most sympathetic man
in the world.

85
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,831
Did you agree
with her there too?

86
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:20,333
McPherson,
you won't understand this...

87
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:25,336
but I tried to become
the kindest, the gentlest...

88
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:28,338
the most sympathetic man
in the world.

89
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:30,940
Have any luck?

90
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,143
Let me put it this way.

91
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:38,846
I should be sincerely sorry to see my
neighbors' children devoured by wolves.

92
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:40,849
Shall we go?

93
00:07:04,063 --> 00:07:06,365
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning, Mrs. Treadwell.

94
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:08,366
- Waldo.
- Good morning, Ann.

95
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:11,669
- I've just taken over the Laura Hunt case.
- Won't you sit down?

96
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:14,170
Thanks. I have
all the reports...

97
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,672
but there are a few more questions
I'd like to ask.

98
00:07:16,672 --> 00:07:18,874
Certainly. I'll do anything
I can to help.

99
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:20,875
You were fond of your niece,
Mrs. Treadwell?

100
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,877
Why, I adored her.
Cigarette?

101
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,778
No, thanks. You collapsed when
you identified the body.

102
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:29,981
I can quite understand that. A shotgun
loaded with buckshot, close range.

103
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:33,184
- It's not very nice to look at.
- It was horrible.

104
00:07:33,284 --> 00:07:35,885
Her maid Bessie, I suppose
she was devoted to Miss Hunt?

105
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:39,288
Oh, she worshipped her.
Laura had had her for years.

106
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:42,690
I'll never forget her scream
when she saw Laura lying there.

107
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,793
Did you approve of Miss Hunt's coming
marriage to Mr. Carpenter?

108
00:07:46,793 --> 00:07:50,296
Why? Shouldn't I approve?

109
00:07:50,396 --> 00:07:54,399
I don't know. What is your relationship
with Mr. Carpenter?

110
00:07:54,498 --> 00:07:56,501
What do you mean?

111
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,503
What I mean is, he's been
a frequent guest in your home.

112
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:02,304
Is he an acquaintance? Friend?
Are you in love with him?

113
00:08:02,304 --> 00:08:04,806
This is beginning to assume
fabulous aspects.

114
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:07,608
Oh, shut up, Waldo!
What are you driving at?

115
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:10,409
The truth, Mrs. Treadwell.
Are you in love with him?

116
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:16,714
Why, no. I'm-- I'm very fond
of Mr. Carpenter, of course.

117
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:19,315
- Everybody is.
- I'm not. I'll be hanged if I am.

118
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:21,618
Oh, don't be
so annoying, Waldo!

119
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:23,720
Did you give
Mr. Carpenter money?

120
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,322
- What do you mean? - A couple of checks
went through your account endorsed by him.

121
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:32,725
One on May 15 for $250.
One on May 22 for $400.

122
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:36,028
Oh, that. I--

123
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:38,929
I asked him to do
some shopping for me. That's all.

124
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,130
Shelby's a very obliging fellow.

125
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,834
For some time, also, you've been
withdrawing various amounts in cash.

126
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,936
Sometimes 1,500.

127
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:49,937
Sometimes 1,700 at a clip.

128
00:08:50,038 --> 00:08:52,339
Yes. I needed that money.

129
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:58,944
The day you took out $1,500,
Mr. Carpenter deposited 1,350.

130
00:08:59,044 --> 00:09:02,247
When you withdrew 1,700,
he deposited 1,550.

131
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:04,348
Maybe they were shooting crap.

132
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:07,349
Oh, must I be insulted like this?

133
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:13,353
I'm sorry, Mrs. Treadwell, but I have
to find out about these things.

134
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:18,057
Shelby needed some money, and I lent it to
him. That's all. After all, it is my money.

135
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,759
- I suppose I can do as I please with it.
- Sure. Of course.

136
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:23,861
Now, on Friday night, Mrs. Treadwell,
you stayed home alone all evening?

137
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:26,963
- Yes. - Why didn't you go
to the concert with Shelby?

138
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:30,165
Because he didn't ask me.

139
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:32,367
We were just talking
about you, Carpenter.

140
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:35,369
- What a coincidence to find you here.
- This is Lieutenant McPherson.

141
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:38,972
- Oh, how do you do, Lieutenant?
- I didn't know you were here, Mr. Carpenter.

142
00:09:39,072 --> 00:09:41,673
As a matter of fact,
I was just lying down here.

143
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:45,477
My hotel room was so hot, and then all
the people and reporters and telephone.

144
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:47,578
You know how it is,
Lieutenant.

145
00:09:47,677 --> 00:09:50,479
I've hardly slept a wink
since it happened.

146
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:53,382
Is that a sign of guilt or innocence,
McPherson?

147
00:09:53,382 --> 00:09:56,984
I'm at your disposal, Lieutenant. I'm as
eager to find the murderer as you are.

148
00:09:56,984 --> 00:09:59,486
But what possible motive
could I have for killing Laura?

149
00:09:59,586 --> 00:10:02,488
Miss Hunt and I were going to be married
this week, you know.

150
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:04,589
No, he doesn't know,
and neither do I...

151
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:08,193
- or you or anyone else alive.
- What do you mean by that?

152
00:10:08,393 --> 00:10:11,395
Laura had not definitely made up
her mind to marry him.

153
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:15,398
She told me so herself last Friday when she
called up to cancel our dinner engagement.

154
00:10:15,497 --> 00:10:18,999
As a matter of fact, she was going
to the country to think it over.

155
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:23,102
She was extremely kind,
but I was always sure...

156
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:25,904
she would never have thrown her life
away on a male beauty in distress.

157
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:28,506
I suppose you've heard
losers whine before...

158
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:30,508
especially in your
profession, eh?

159
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:32,308
Would you like
a bite of lunch, Lieutenant?

160
00:10:32,308 --> 00:10:34,810
That's very thoughtful--
the perfect host.

161
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,612
- Waldo.
- You'd almost think he was in his own home.

162
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:40,715
Shelby knows how distracted I am.
Would you, Lieutenant?

163
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:42,917
Thank you, Mrs. Treadwell,
but I've got to be going.

164
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:46,619
But, Lieutenant, I-- Well, I rather thought
you'd want to ask me some questions.

165
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:49,822
Oh, yes. What did they play
at the concert Friday night?

166
00:10:49,922 --> 00:10:52,623
Oh, Brahms's First
and Beethoven's Ninth.

167
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:56,126
Uh-huh. Have you got a key
to Miss Hunt's house up in the country?

168
00:10:56,226 --> 00:10:59,028
No, but I think there's one
up in her apartment.

169
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:01,629
- Okay, I'll have a look.
- Perhaps I could help you?

170
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:03,630
All right. Come along.

171
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,232
I'll be seeing you,
Mrs. Treadwell.

172
00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:13,537
Extra! Extra!
Girl victim in brutal slaying!

173
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:16,039
Extra! Girl victim
in brutal slaying!

174
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,641
Read all about it!
Girl victim in brutal slaying!

175
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:21,344
Girl victim
in brutal slaying! Read all about it!

176
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,848
All right.
Break it up. Break it up.

177
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:31,951
Ice-cold drinks!

178
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:01,372
- The doorbell rang.
- What?

179
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:04,774
As she opened the door,
the shot was fired.

180
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:06,875
And how do you deduce that?

181
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:10,377
She fell backward.
The body was there.

182
00:12:11,378 --> 00:12:14,480
I thought you hadn't
been up here before.

183
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,681
I saw the police photos.

184
00:12:25,688 --> 00:12:28,290
I guess I better
try and find that key.

185
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:33,494
McPherson, tell me, why did they have to
photograph her in that horrible condition?

186
00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:36,396
When a dame gets killed,
she doesn't worry about how she looks.

187
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:39,297
Will you stop calling her a dame?
Look around.

188
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:42,800
Is this the home of a dame?

189
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:46,603
Look at her.

190
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:52,106
Not bad.

191
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:55,208
Jacoby was in love with her
when he painted it...

192
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,010
but he never captured
her vibrance, her warmth.

193
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,914
Have you ever been in love?

194
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:05,316
A doll in Washington Heights
once got a fox fur out of me.

195
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:09,018
Ever know a woman who wasn't
a "doll" or a "dame"?

196
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,322
Yeah, one, but she kept walking me
past furniture windows...

197
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:17,824
to look at the parlor suites.

198
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:20,626
- Would you mind turning that off?
- Why? Don't you like it?

199
00:13:20,626 --> 00:13:24,430
It was one of Laura's favorites.
Not exactly classical, but sweet.

200
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,631
- You know a lot about music?
- I don't know a lot about anything...

201
00:13:27,631 --> 00:13:29,933
but I know a little
about practically everything.

202
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:31,933
Yeah? Then why did you say...

203
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:36,037
they played Brahms's First and Beethoven's
Ninth at the concert Friday night?

204
00:13:36,037 --> 00:13:39,340
They changed the program at the last
minute and played nothing but Sibelius.

205
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,841
I suppose I should have
told you in the first place.

206
00:13:41,841 --> 00:13:44,543
I'd been working on that
advertising campaign with Laura.

207
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:47,945
Well, we'd been working so hard, I--
I just couldn't keep my eyes open.

208
00:13:47,945 --> 00:13:50,647
I didn't hear a note at the concert.
I fell asleep.

209
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:53,649
Next he'll produce
photographic evidence of his dreams.

210
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:56,751
I know it sounds suspicious,
but I'm resigned to that by now.

211
00:13:56,751 --> 00:14:00,454
I'm a natural-born suspect just because
I'm not the conventional type.

212
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:02,654
I wouldn't worry about it,
Mr. Carpenter.

213
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:06,358
It sounds reasonable.
I fall asleep at concerts myself.

214
00:14:06,358 --> 00:14:08,159
Thank you.

215
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:11,062
You found
that key yet?

216
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:15,565
No. I looked for it in the den,
but it wasn't there. It may be in here.

217
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,672
Yes, here it is.

218
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,173
I knew there must be
one around somewhere.

219
00:14:27,273 --> 00:14:29,974
The police are very fussy
about their inventories.

220
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:33,477
That key isn't on the list of things
that were in that drawer yesterday.

221
00:14:33,477 --> 00:14:35,978
Then it's made
a recent reappearance.

222
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:38,280
You put it there,
didn't you?

223
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,782
- Yes.
- Why?

224
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:44,083
It's just that I didn't want to give it
to you while Waldo was present.

225
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,886
- Oh. - I have private reasons
that don't concern him.

226
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,089
Everything about Laura
concerns me.

227
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,090
You have private reasons,
no doubt, to lie about the key.

228
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,194
Waldo, for your own good,
I'm warning you to stop implying...

229
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:58,695
that I had anything to do
with Laura's death.

230
00:14:58,695 --> 00:15:01,097
Very well.
I'll stop implying.

231
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:03,097
I'll make
a direct statement.

232
00:15:03,097 --> 00:15:04,999
All right,
you asked for it.

233
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:07,901
I wouldn't.

234
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:10,503
Will you please stop dawdling
with that infernal puzzle?

235
00:15:10,602 --> 00:15:14,906
- It's getting on my nerves.
- I know, but it keeps me calm.

236
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:17,007
Okay, let's go.

237
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:34,720
This was our table--

238
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:36,822
Laura's and mine.

239
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:40,724
We spent many quiet evenings
here together.

240
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:46,528
I remember we dined here the night
before her 22nd birthday.

241
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:49,230
Just we two--

242
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,432
happy, making plans
for her future.

243
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:57,436
- Good luck.
But this was a far cry...

244
00:15:57,436 --> 00:16:02,539
from the girl who walked into my life
at the Algonquin Hotel five years before.

245
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,741
Pardon me.
Excuse me.

246
00:16:08,044 --> 00:16:10,045
Excuse me.

247
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,053
Mr. Lydecker,
how do you do?

248
00:16:22,252 --> 00:16:25,755
My name is Laura Hunt,
and I'm with Bullitt and Company.

249
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,156
You know,
the big advertising firm.

250
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:31,160
And I'd like to talk
something over with you, if I may.

251
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:35,563
You can hardly fail to realize that
I am engaged in eating my lunch.

252
00:16:35,563 --> 00:16:39,466
Yes, I know. I'm awfully sorry
to interrupt this way...

253
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:42,568
but it's so hard to get to see you
the regular way, and...

254
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,969
this will only
take a minute, really.

255
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,673
- Now, this is--
- Young woman...

256
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:53,674
either you have been raised
in some incredibly rustic community...

257
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:56,276
where good manners
are unknown...

258
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:58,779
or you suffer from the common
feminine delusion...

259
00:16:58,678 --> 00:17:00,779
that the mere fact
of being a woman...

260
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:04,283
exempts you from the rules
of civilized conduct.

261
00:17:04,784 --> 00:17:06,885
Or possibly both.

262
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:09,687
Possibly, but here's
what I wanted to show you.

263
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:11,688
It's for
the Wallace Flow-Rite pen.

264
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:16,090
I know my company would be glad to pay
you $5,000 if you'll endorse the ad.

265
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,093
I don't use a pen.

266
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:20,293
I write with a goose quill
dipped in venom.

267
00:17:20,293 --> 00:17:23,296
Yes, but this is a very fine pen,
Mr. Lydecker...

268
00:17:23,395 --> 00:17:25,297
the best on the market.

269
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:27,998
Wouldn't you at least
consider endorsing it?

270
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:32,402
I'll neither consider, endorse
or use the Wallace pen.

271
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:34,904
I hate pens.

272
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:38,307
If your employers wish me to publish
that statement in my column...

273
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,108
you may tell them that I shall be
delighted to oblige.

274
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:45,211
Oh, no.
You mustn't do that.

275
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:47,612
Don't blame Bullitt and Company,
Mr. Lydecker.

276
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:51,515
They don't know anything about this.
It was my idea to see you.

277
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:54,317
Indeed?

278
00:17:54,317 --> 00:17:58,721
Yes. I know they'd give anything down
at the office to get your endorsement...

279
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:01,322
only they think
there's no use asking.

280
00:18:01,322 --> 00:18:04,325
So I had this ad made up
all on my own...

281
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:08,127
because I thought, well,
what's the harm in trying?

282
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:10,728
There was always a chance
that you might, Mr. Lydecker.

283
00:18:10,728 --> 00:18:12,530
Just think what
it would mean--

284
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:17,033
You seem to be completely disregarding
something more important than your career.

285
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:19,235
- What?
- My lunch.

286
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:23,438
Do you really believe that?

287
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:26,040
Implicitly.

288
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,641
I never heard
of anything so selfish.

289
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:33,444
In my case, self-absorption
is completely justified.

290
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:37,147
I have never discovered any other
subject quite so worthy of my attention.

291
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:39,749
But you write about people...

292
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:43,350
with such real understanding
and sentiment.

293
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:46,752
That's what makes
your column so good.

294
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:50,356
Sentiment comes easily
at 50 cents a word.

295
00:18:51,658 --> 00:18:53,859
Well, if that's the way
you really feel...

296
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,963
you must be very lonely.

297
00:18:58,162 --> 00:19:02,065
Will you kindly continue
this character analysis elsewhere?

298
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,466
- You begin to bore me.
- You're a poor man.

299
00:19:05,466 --> 00:19:07,669
I'm very sorry for you.

300
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,972
Naturally,
I was annoyed by the incident...

301
00:19:14,273 --> 00:19:16,574
but she had something
about her, that girl.

302
00:19:17,776 --> 00:19:21,878
I had to speak to her again.
I had to see her.

303
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:24,281
- Miss, would you mind if I--
- Just a moment, please.

304
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,782
I'll tell Mr. Bullitt right away.
He's on the telephone.

305
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:29,183
Thank you.

306
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:54,400
Boy, Waldo Lydecker
to see Miss Laura Hunt.

307
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:58,205
Announce me.

308
00:19:58,205 --> 00:20:01,307
Johnny, please tell
the gentleman I'm busy.

309
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:09,211
Miss Hunt, I have something
to say to you.

310
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:11,713
You've already said it,
Mr. Lydecker.

311
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:15,515
I wish to point out that you caught me
at my most difficult moment.

312
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:18,317
Ordinarily I am not
without a heart.

313
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,319
Really?

314
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,621
Shall I produce
X-ray pictures to prove it?

315
00:20:26,223 --> 00:20:28,524
I wish to apologize.

316
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,625
Your apology is accepted.

317
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:34,930
Good-bye, Mr. Lydecker.

318
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:37,231
If you come
a little bit closer, my boy...

319
00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:39,834
I can just crack your skull
with my stick.

320
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:47,538
And now, for reasons
which are too embarrassing to mention...

321
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:51,140
I'd like to endorse that pen.

322
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:53,342
Mr. Lydecker!

323
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:55,444
Thank you.

324
00:20:57,945 --> 00:21:01,047
- You're a very strange man.
- What?

325
00:21:01,148 --> 00:21:05,150
You're really sorry
for the way you acted, aren't you?

326
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,853
Let's not be psychiatric,
Miss Hunt...

327
00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:11,255
but in a word, yes.

328
00:21:12,155 --> 00:21:14,057
It's very kind of you,
you know.

329
00:21:14,158 --> 00:21:17,959
I'm not kind. I'm vicious.
It's the secret of my charm.

330
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:23,063
But if you choose
to think me kind...

331
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:26,565
I'll call for you at 6:00.

332
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,868
All right?

333
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:32,069
All right.

334
00:21:35,572 --> 00:21:38,573
Her career began
with my endorsement of the pen.

335
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:41,777
I secured other endorsements for her...

336
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:43,978
introduced her
to important clients.

337
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:47,880
I gave her her start...

338
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,082
but it was her own talent
and imagination...

339
00:21:50,182 --> 00:21:52,684
that enabled her to rise
to the top of her profession...

340
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:55,186
and stay there.

341
00:21:56,086 --> 00:21:59,388
She had an eager mind always.

342
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:03,191
She was always quick to seize upon
anything that would improve her mind...

343
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,492
or her appearance.

344
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,895
Laura had innate breeding.

345
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:17,202
But she deferred
to my judgment and taste.

346
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:21,504
I selected a more attractive
hairdress for her.

347
00:22:23,506 --> 00:22:26,908
I taught her what clothes
were more becoming to her.

348
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:31,511
Through me, she met everyone.

349
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:34,312
The famous and the infamous.

350
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:38,616
Her youth and beauty, her poise
and charm of manner...

351
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,917
captivated them all.

352
00:22:41,017 --> 00:22:44,419
She had warmth, vitality.

353
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,021
She had authentic magnetism.

354
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:51,826
Wherever we went,
she stood out.

355
00:22:52,025 --> 00:22:55,828
Men admired her.
Women envied her.

356
00:22:56,028 --> 00:23:00,031
She became as well known
as Waldo Lydecker's walking stick...

357
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:02,432
and his white carnation.

358
00:23:02,532 --> 00:23:05,734
But Tuesday and Friday nights
we stayed home...

359
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:09,237
dining quietly,
listening to my records.

360
00:23:10,237 --> 00:23:13,240
I read my articles to her.

361
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,343
The way she listened
was more eloquent than speech.

362
00:23:19,043 --> 00:23:20,845
These were the best nights.

363
00:23:22,346 --> 00:23:25,950
Then one Tuesday, she phoned
and said she couldn't come.

364
00:23:26,951 --> 00:23:29,452
It didn't matter, really.

365
00:23:29,452 --> 00:23:33,455
But when it happened again
the following Friday, I was disturbed.

366
00:23:35,356 --> 00:23:39,358
I couldn't
understand it. I felt betrayed...

367
00:23:40,158 --> 00:23:43,761
and yet I knew Laura
would never betray anyone.

368
00:23:49,665 --> 00:23:52,467
I walked for a long time.

369
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:57,471
Then I found myself
before her apartment building.

370
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:02,375
The lights were on.
It pleased me to know she was home...

371
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,676
till I saw she was not alone.

372
00:24:06,477 --> 00:24:10,781
But I waited.
I wanted to see who he was.

373
00:24:15,684 --> 00:24:19,386
It was Jacoby, who had recently
painted her portrait.

374
00:24:19,686 --> 00:24:22,087
I never liked the man.

375
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:27,092
He was so obviously conscious of looking
more like an athlete than an artist.

376
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:30,593
I sat up the rest of the night
writing a column about him.

377
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:32,095
I demolished his affectations...

378
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,397
exposed his camouflaged
imitations of better painters...

379
00:24:35,498 --> 00:24:38,199
ridiculed his theories.

380
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:42,303
I did it for her,
knowing Jacoby was unworthy of her.

381
00:24:42,303 --> 00:24:45,905
It was a masterpiece
because it was a labor of love.

382
00:24:45,905 --> 00:24:49,507
Naturally, she could never
regard him seriously again.

383
00:24:50,207 --> 00:24:53,209
There were others,
of course...

384
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:55,611
but her own discrimination
ruled them out...

385
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:58,812
before it became necessary
for me to intercede...

386
00:25:00,014 --> 00:25:03,416
until one night at a party
at Ann Treadwell's.

387
00:25:03,516 --> 00:25:07,919
It was one of her usual roundups
of bizarre and nondescript characters...

388
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,122
- corralled from every stratum of society.
- How are you this evening?

389
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:12,523
This is Mr. and Mrs. Preston.
They've been waiting to meet you.

390
00:25:12,623 --> 00:25:14,525
How do you do?

391
00:25:17,627 --> 00:25:19,829
- Hello, Shelby.
- Excuse me, honey.

392
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:26,333
You're Laura Hunt.

393
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:29,936
- Yes?
- Hello. I'm Shelby Carpenter.

394
00:25:30,136 --> 00:25:33,338
- Want to dance?
- I'm not alone.

395
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:38,140
Oh, him? I'll bet
he's still doing the polka.

396
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,742
Excuse me, please. Yes.

397
00:25:40,742 --> 00:25:42,845
Betsy Ross taught it to me.

398
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:44,846
- Hello, Waldo. Darling, how are you?
- Hello, darling.

399
00:25:44,846 --> 00:25:46,947
- I see you've met Shelby.
- Hello, Ann.

400
00:25:46,947 --> 00:25:50,049
- Unavoidably. - He was awfully nice
to me in Louisville at the Derby.

401
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,052
His family's from Kentucky.

402
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,153
Sharecroppers, no doubt.

403
00:25:59,256 --> 00:26:02,458
Louise. Louise, for the last time,
will you marry me?

404
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:05,260
I won't, but I've saved
some chicken livers for you.

405
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,161
Oh, you're an angel.
In the meantime, darling...

406
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:09,362
you think you could
get this spot out for me?

407
00:26:09,362 --> 00:26:12,265
I can afford a blemish on my character
but not on my clothes.

408
00:26:12,265 --> 00:26:14,865
- Mmm. Couldn't eat another mouthful.
- I'm afraid it's rouge.

409
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:17,068
- I'm afraid it's liquor.
- Louise. Oh.

410
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:20,372
- May I have a glass of milk for Mr. Lydecker?
- Of course, Miss Hunt.

411
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:22,473
I forgot to tell you.
I also read palms.

412
00:26:22,473 --> 00:26:26,575
I cook, I swallow swords, I mend my own
socks, I never eat garlic or onions.

413
00:26:26,575 --> 00:26:28,477
What more can you want
of a man?

414
00:26:28,477 --> 00:26:31,579
- Don't listen to that scalawag.
- I didn't expect to find him here, Louise.

415
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:33,380
What do you mean?
We're old friends.

416
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,181
She feeds me,
humors me, repairs me...

417
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:37,282
and refuses to marry me,
don't you, honey?

418
00:26:37,282 --> 00:26:39,284
- I do.
- She has good sense.

419
00:26:39,284 --> 00:26:42,286
- Now, wait just a minute. Thanks, Louise.
- You're wasting your time.

420
00:26:42,286 --> 00:26:44,888
- She's got good sense too.
- You're jealous.

421
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:49,290
And what does it feel like,
Mr. Carpenter?

422
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,092
What does what feel like,
Miss Hunt?

423
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,495
Living on the income
from an estate.

424
00:26:54,495 --> 00:26:56,596
- Well, I, uh--
- Or don't you know?

425
00:26:56,596 --> 00:27:01,099
Well, I did, until the sheriff
took it over 10 years ago.

426
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:03,401
Why maintain the fiction?
Why not work?

427
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:07,004
Believe it or not, I asked
one of my many friends for a job once--

428
00:27:07,004 --> 00:27:09,705
executive of a big company--
2,500 employees.

429
00:27:09,705 --> 00:27:12,707
He could have pressed a button
and done it, but he just laughed.

430
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:14,708
- He thought I was joking.
- Weren't you?

431
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:17,710
No. When I convinced him, he got
embarrassed, said he'd phone me.

432
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:23,314
That was months ago. Now whenever
he sees me, he looks the other way.

433
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,421
- Do you really want a job?
- Yes.

434
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:37,324
Oh, here you are.

435
00:27:37,425 --> 00:27:41,127
Laura, dear, I cannot stand
these morons any longer.

436
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:45,030
If you don't come with me
this instant, I shall run amok.

437
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,030
All right, Waldo.

438
00:27:48,132 --> 00:27:50,633
10:30 tomorrow,
Bullitt and Company.

439
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:53,535
You've got a job.

440
00:27:53,735 --> 00:27:58,039
I concealed my
annoyance with masterly self-control...

441
00:27:58,638 --> 00:28:02,541
but I sensed a situation
which would bear watching.

442
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:06,445
Laura, take a look at this.

443
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:10,147
Do you like it? Do you think it'll make
people want to bathe more often?

444
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,649
It should. It's excellent.

445
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,550
- There you are.
- Good night, Miss Hunt.

446
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,552
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Carpenter.

447
00:28:16,652 --> 00:28:19,654
- Good night, honey.
- It's really very good. Who's the model?

448
00:28:19,754 --> 00:28:22,656
A girl named Diane Redfern.
You hired her yourself last week.

449
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,557
- Don't you remember?
- Oh, yeah.

450
00:28:24,557 --> 00:28:27,759
Well, let's go, moon of my delight.
I am starved.

451
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:29,961
You usually are.

452
00:28:29,961 --> 00:28:31,762
- I approve of that hat.
- You do?

453
00:28:31,762 --> 00:28:34,564
Mm-hmm.
And the girl in it too.

454
00:28:34,564 --> 00:28:36,565
Thank you.

455
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:41,570
I knew there was
something on my mind.

456
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:44,972
What is it? Oh, yes.
Will you dine with me tomorrow night?

457
00:28:45,172 --> 00:28:47,574
- Maybe.
- No, that isn't what's worrying me.

458
00:28:47,673 --> 00:28:49,774
- It's the next night.
- But, Shelby, I can't be--

459
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,876
Good. What about three weeks from
tonight and all the nights in between?

460
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:55,279
Don't you think
I have any other engagements?

461
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,281
What about two months
from now and the month after that?

462
00:28:58,281 --> 00:29:01,583
- What about next year?
- That's all settled. What about breakfast?

463
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:04,585
What about dancing?

464
00:29:04,686 --> 00:29:06,586
What about lunch?
Beautiful lunches...

465
00:29:06,686 --> 00:29:09,488
- day after day after day after day?
- What about work?

466
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:12,391
Beautiful work,
day after day after day?

467
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:14,492
Why, Miss Hunt,
the way you talk.

468
00:29:14,492 --> 00:29:16,594
You'd think I was
in love with you.

469
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,199
Yes, Laura,
I heard everything he said.

470
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:30,803
I went to call for you.

471
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:34,005
I'm sorry, Waldo.

472
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:36,007
And that reminds me.

473
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:42,610
Old Mother Hubbard has
something in the cupboard.

474
00:29:43,612 --> 00:29:47,416
The results of
my private investigation...

475
00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:49,217
of that sterling character,
Mr. Shelby Carpenter.

476
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:53,519
By stooping so low, you only
degrade yourself, Waldo.

477
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,023
Did you know that he almost went to jail
for passing rubber checks...

478
00:29:58,023 --> 00:30:00,425
that he was suspected of stealing
his hostess's jewels...

479
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,826
when he was a houseguest
in Virginia?

480
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:05,828
Naturally they'd suspect him,
because he isn't rich.

481
00:30:06,528 --> 00:30:08,629
Those are only insinuations...

482
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,832
the cheapest kind.

483
00:30:11,031 --> 00:30:13,533
These aren't only
insinuations, my dear.

484
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:15,634
There you are.
Read them.

485
00:30:17,635 --> 00:30:19,638
What of it?

486
00:30:19,737 --> 00:30:23,740
I know his faults.
A man can change, can't he?

487
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,643
People are always ready
to hold out a hand to slap you down...

488
00:30:26,643 --> 00:30:28,844
but never to pick you up.

489
00:30:28,844 --> 00:30:31,045
All right,
I'm helping Shelby.

490
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:33,146
His past is his own affair.

491
00:30:33,347 --> 00:30:36,150
I only care about the present.

492
00:30:36,349 --> 00:30:39,451
Speaking of the changed Mr. Carpenter
in the present tense...

493
00:30:40,952 --> 00:30:43,855
he's now running around
with a model from your own office.

494
00:30:43,855 --> 00:30:46,055
Her name is Diane Redfern.

495
00:30:48,358 --> 00:30:51,860
I'm closer to despising you
than I thought I ever would be.

496
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:02,068
I'm sorry. I should have
told you before.

497
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:05,069
Shelby and I are going to be
married next week.

498
00:31:08,972 --> 00:31:13,175
I believe you presented him with
a cigarette case on his last birthday.

499
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:17,778
Rather valuable, isn't it?

500
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:19,979
Where did you get it?

501
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,682
From the pawnshop where Diane Redfern
took it after he gave it to her.

502
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:27,184
I don't believe it. He probably needed
money and was too proud to borrow.

503
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:29,186
Carpenter proud?

504
00:31:30,186 --> 00:31:32,890
Perhaps that's why
the pawn ticket was in her name.

505
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,991
Before this goes any further,
why, I'll just--

506
00:31:37,191 --> 00:31:39,194
He isn't home.

507
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:48,799
He's dining
at Ann Treadwell's.

508
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,302
He can't be.
He asked me to dinner.

509
00:31:51,302 --> 00:31:54,904
He would have canceled his appointment
with her if you had accepted.

510
00:31:54,904 --> 00:31:57,807
He treats her
rather badly these days.

511
00:31:59,407 --> 00:32:02,108
I'm afraid she'll say
he isn't there.

512
00:32:11,116 --> 00:32:13,117
Waldo...

513
00:32:14,218 --> 00:32:16,219
why are you doing this?

514
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,523
For you, Laura.

515
00:32:25,426 --> 00:32:28,327
Shall we pay them a visit?

516
00:32:28,427 --> 00:32:31,930
He won't be there, Waldo.
I know he won't.

517
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,932
All right. We'll see.

518
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:40,936
Don't you want to take this little
bauble along in case he is there?

519
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,243
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

520
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,445
- I'm sorry. Mrs. Treadwell is not home.
- We know, dear.

521
00:33:06,054 --> 00:33:07,954
Good evening.

522
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:15,961
Hello, darling. I didn't expect
to see you tonight.

523
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,962
There you are, my dear.

524
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,764
In a moment of supreme disaster,
he's trite.

525
00:33:20,764 --> 00:33:23,566
You've been reading
too many melodramas, Waldo.

526
00:33:23,665 --> 00:33:26,768
I was just telling Ann
about our getting married.

527
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:28,970
Well, have you two
had dinner?

528
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,872
Would you like
a glass of wine?

529
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:34,073
Why don't you sit down?

530
00:33:42,578 --> 00:33:46,382
I couldn't find out
if she saw Carpenter in the meantime.

531
00:33:46,581 --> 00:33:50,485
All I know is that on Friday
she had lunch with Diane Redfern.

532
00:33:51,486 --> 00:33:54,588
What came of it,
I hoped to hear that night.

533
00:33:54,588 --> 00:33:58,290
- I alternated between moods of
overoptimism and overpessimism.

534
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,392
When the phone rang,
I had a foreboding of disaster.

535
00:34:04,994 --> 00:34:07,997
I called to tell you, Waldo,
I'm frightfully sorry.

536
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:10,399
I can't have dinner
with you tonight.

537
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:14,100
Oh, no, no. I'm not sick.
I'm just dreadfully nervous.

538
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:16,803
I'm going to the country
for a few days.

539
00:34:16,903 --> 00:34:19,305
Yes. I'm afraid
it's about Shelby.

540
00:34:20,006 --> 00:34:22,206
Oh, no. Please.
There's nothing you can do.

541
00:34:22,206 --> 00:34:24,910
I've got to think
this thing out for myself.

542
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:29,212
I'm sorry. I'll call you
when I get back. Good-bye.

543
00:34:30,713 --> 00:34:33,414
It was the last time
I ever heard her voice.

544
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:37,918
I was sure she had
too much pride to forgive him.

545
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,321
But--

546
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,423
Where does
this Diane Redfern live?

547
00:34:44,523 --> 00:34:47,825
Brooklyn somewhere.
She's in the phone book.

548
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:51,627
Come on. It's late.
Let's get going.

549
00:34:52,227 --> 00:34:54,429
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir.

550
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:59,733
- All right.
- Thank you, Mr. Lydecker.

551
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:05,938
Good night.

552
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,243
I shall never forgive myself for
letting her become involved with Shelby.

553
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:16,645
It was my fault.

554
00:35:16,545 --> 00:35:19,147
I should have
stopped it somehow.

555
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:21,248
Well, it's too late now.

556
00:35:25,051 --> 00:35:27,152
Thanks for the wine.

557
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:46,666
Hello. Mosconi's?

558
00:35:46,766 --> 00:35:49,968
This is Lieutenant McPherson,
Homicide Bureau.

559
00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:54,171
Laura Hunt had been buying her liquor
from you for several years, hadn't she?

560
00:35:54,272 --> 00:35:56,472
Yeah.

561
00:35:56,573 --> 00:36:00,275
Did she ever buy a brand of scotch
called Black Pony?

562
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:03,378
Yeah.

563
00:36:04,378 --> 00:36:07,080
I see.

564
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,282
Well, that's all
I wanted to know. Thanks.

565
00:36:09,382 --> 00:36:11,283
She's here, McPherson--
the maid.

566
00:36:11,383 --> 00:36:13,585
Okay.

567
00:36:13,685 --> 00:36:16,887
- Come in, Miss Clary.
- Never mind the "Miss Clary" stuff.

568
00:36:16,887 --> 00:36:20,890
My name's Bessie, and I'm a domestic,
and I got nothin' to be ashamed of.

569
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:22,691
Sit down, Bessie.

570
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:25,994
Her letters.

571
00:36:26,094 --> 00:36:27,994
And her private diary.

572
00:36:29,196 --> 00:36:31,197
You've been reading them,
pawing over them.

573
00:36:31,297 --> 00:36:34,699
It's a shame in the face of the dead.
That's what it is. It's a shame.

574
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:37,400
- Sit down, Bessie.
- I'll stand on my own two feet.

575
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:39,602
Don't you go
ordering me around.

576
00:36:39,702 --> 00:36:44,507
I ain't afraid of cops. I was
brought up to spit whenever I saw one.

577
00:36:44,507 --> 00:36:48,608
Okay, go ahead and spit
if that'll make you feel better.

578
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:56,215
What do you want to know?

579
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,816
What we all want to know--
who killed Laura Hunt.

580
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:00,618
How would I know?

581
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:04,520
You don't think I done it?

582
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,222
I know you cops
get crazy notions...

583
00:37:07,422 --> 00:37:09,724
but if you got any notion
concerning me--

584
00:37:09,824 --> 00:37:13,326
Ask anyone--
anyone who ever come to this house.

585
00:37:13,326 --> 00:37:15,528
I would have
worked for her.

586
00:37:15,528 --> 00:37:17,228
I would have washed,
ironed, scrubbed...

587
00:37:17,328 --> 00:37:21,032
done everything she wanted of me,
whether she paid me for it or not.

588
00:37:21,132 --> 00:37:25,135
And it wasn't only on account of the
thousand sweet things she done for me.

589
00:37:25,235 --> 00:37:27,737
It was because she was
so sweet herself...

590
00:37:27,836 --> 00:37:31,439
because she was
a real fine lady.

591
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,241
But you cops
wouldn't know about that.

592
00:37:36,442 --> 00:37:41,646
But you do. That's all the more reason
why you should help me, Bessie.

593
00:37:41,747 --> 00:37:44,748
Do you happen to know how this got into
her liquor cabinet?

594
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:48,251
I put it there.

595
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,253
But she never bought cheap stuff like
that-- not a lady like Miss Hunt.

596
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:55,255
- No.
- When did you put it in the cabinet?

597
00:37:55,255 --> 00:37:57,158
- Saturday.
- Before the police came.

598
00:37:57,158 --> 00:38:00,959
- Was it there Friday night before you left?
- No.

599
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:03,061
Are you sure of that?

600
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:05,863
I cleaned out
the cabinet on Friday...

601
00:38:05,863 --> 00:38:07,964
and put the empties
in the basement.

602
00:38:08,765 --> 00:38:11,666
Then somebody was with her
in the apartment Friday night...

603
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,468
someone
who brought that bottle.

604
00:38:13,468 --> 00:38:15,269
- Yes.
- Who?

605
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:18,071
I don't know,
but I didn't want anyone...

606
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:21,473
getting any wrong ideas about her,
God rest her soul.

607
00:38:18,472 --> 00:38:24,375
That's why I took it out of the bedroom
and put it in the cabinet...

608
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:26,177
before the police got here.

609
00:38:26,277 --> 00:38:28,780
And that ain't all I done.

610
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,882
I washed out the glasses
and cleaned off the bottle too.

611
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:34,483
Do you know what happens to people
who destroy evidence?

612
00:38:34,483 --> 00:38:37,385
I don't care.

613
00:38:37,486 --> 00:38:39,386
You ain't gonna tell
the newspaper reporters, are ya...

614
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:41,588
and let them make up
their nasty stories...

615
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:44,190
and drag her name
through the mud?

616
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,893
Go ahead,
but it won't do you any good.

617
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:50,894
- I'll say you lied. I'll say--
- Take it easy, Bessie.

618
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:54,096
Get me some ice
and a setup, will you?

619
00:38:54,096 --> 00:38:56,197
All right.

620
00:38:56,197 --> 00:38:58,299
A couple of highball glasses.

621
00:39:02,903 --> 00:39:04,805
Good morning.
Lieutenant McPherson sent for us.

622
00:39:04,904 --> 00:39:06,806
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Hello, McPherson.

623
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:09,908
- This is quite a delegation.
I only sent for you, Carpenter. - I know.

624
00:39:09,908 --> 00:39:12,309
Shelby's dropping me off
at the hairdresser's later...

625
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:15,712
- so I thought I might as well come along.
- My excuse is equally feeble.

626
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,013
I just popped in
to pay my dubious respects...

627
00:39:18,013 --> 00:39:20,114
and inquire as to
the state of your health.

628
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:22,617
- Insipid, I trust.
- I was just going to pour myself a drink.

629
00:39:22,617 --> 00:39:26,219
- Care to join me? - A very nice idea.
Shelby, wouldn't you like one?

630
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:28,220
- I'll get it.
- Never mind.

631
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,622
- Bessie, would you bring a
couple more glasses? - Yes, sir.

632
00:39:30,622 --> 00:39:32,723
Hi, Bessie.
What are you doing here?

633
00:39:32,723 --> 00:39:34,825
I'm paid up for the week,
and I'm working, regardless.

634
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:38,129
- Would you like one, Lydecker?
- I see no reason to exclude myself...

635
00:39:38,129 --> 00:39:40,129
if the host provides scotch.

636
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:42,730
- This do?
- I presume it'll have to.

637
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,832
How about you, Carpenter?
It's cheap, but it's potent.

638
00:39:44,832 --> 00:39:48,635
As a matter of fact, I don't think I care
for any. I'm not much of a daytime drinker.

639
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:53,138
- Uh-huh. That'll be all for you, Bessie.
You can go home now. - But I-- Yes, sir.

640
00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:56,440
I remember when Laura
bought these glasses.

641
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,941
She loved them.
She loved all her things so.

642
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:01,443
What are you going to do?
Sell them?

643
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:04,345
I don't know.
I suppose so. Thank you.

644
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:08,448
If I'm appointed administrator of the estate,
I shall probably just call in Corey.

645
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,749
You mean Lancaster Corey,
the art dealer?

646
00:40:10,749 --> 00:40:12,753
Yes. He was
a friend of Laura's.

647
00:40:12,753 --> 00:40:16,155
Let him dispose of everything.
It'll be less gruesome that way.

648
00:40:16,155 --> 00:40:19,156
Not quite everything, Ann.

649
00:40:19,256 --> 00:40:21,558
Two or three things in here
belong to me.

650
00:40:21,658 --> 00:40:23,859
This vase, for instance...

651
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,861
and that, uh, clock,
of course...

652
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:29,863
and the antique fire screen.

653
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:32,765
- I only lent them to Laura, you know.
- Oh, really, Waldo.

654
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:36,568
Yes, really. This vase is the gem of my
collection. I intend to have it back.

655
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:38,370
And the clock and the screen too.

656
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,271
But they aren't yours. You gave them
to Laura. I won't permit it.

657
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:44,874
Does an alleged fiance
have any voice in this matter?

658
00:40:44,874 --> 00:40:49,878
I'll take the vase with me now
and send someone to collect
the other things this very day.

659
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:53,580
Nothing is leaving here
except you, Lydecker.

660
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,883
Is that your quaint way
of indicating dismissal?

661
00:40:56,883 --> 00:41:00,185
We're all going anyway. I have to be
back at headquarters by noon.

662
00:41:00,185 --> 00:41:03,788
Lieutenant, I don't understand.
You sent for me, didn't you?

663
00:41:03,788 --> 00:41:06,088
- Yeah.
- Well, don't you want to see me?

664
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,791
- Don't you want to ask me some questions?
- I'll be seeing you.

665
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:11,092
- Well--
- I bid you good day.

666
00:41:11,092 --> 00:41:14,795
- Come along, Shelby. - Are you making
any progress on the case, Lieutenant?

667
00:41:16,396 --> 00:41:18,397
We're doing all right.

668
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,909
- Hello, Mark.
- Go get something to eat. I'll take over.

669
00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:38,312
- Thanks.
- Take your time.

670
00:44:38,037 --> 00:44:40,238
Fred?

671
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:46,842
- Yes?
- What's the matter? Did you go to sleep?

672
00:44:47,043 --> 00:44:49,745
This is McPherson.
Any calls come through?

673
00:44:51,546 --> 00:44:53,548
Well, keep listening.

674
00:44:53,648 --> 00:44:55,649
No. Nothing new.

675
00:45:01,854 --> 00:45:04,255
I happened to see
the lights on.

676
00:45:05,156 --> 00:45:07,357
Have you sublet
this apartment?

677
00:45:07,357 --> 00:45:09,359
You're here often enough
to pay rent.

678
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,761
- Any objections?
- Yes.

679
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:14,862
I object to you prying
into Laura's letters...

680
00:45:14,862 --> 00:45:16,863
especially those from me.

681
00:45:16,863 --> 00:45:19,865
- Why? Yours are the best in the bunch.
- Thanks.

682
00:45:19,865 --> 00:45:22,168
But I didn't
write them to you.

683
00:45:22,267 --> 00:45:24,870
Haven't you any sense
of privacy?

684
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,072
Murder victims have
no claim to privacy.

685
00:45:29,072 --> 00:45:33,075
Have detectives who buy portraits
of murder victims a claim to privacy?

686
00:45:34,577 --> 00:45:38,079
Lancaster Corey told me
that you've already put in a bid for it.

687
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,480
That's none of your business.

688
00:45:40,581 --> 00:45:44,584
McPherson, did it ever strike you
that you're acting very strangely?

689
00:45:44,682 --> 00:45:48,185
It's a wonder you don't come here like a
suitor, with roses and a box of candy--

690
00:45:48,285 --> 00:45:50,287
drugstore candy, of course.

691
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,890
Have you ever dreamed
of Laura as your wife...

692
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:57,092
by your side at the policeman's ball,
or in the bleachers...

693
00:45:57,192 --> 00:46:00,295
or listening to the heroic story of how
you got a silver shinbone...

694
00:46:00,395 --> 00:46:02,697
from a gun battle
with a gangster?

695
00:46:04,397 --> 00:46:08,000
- I see you have.
- Why don't you go home? I'm busy.

696
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,102
Perhaps we can
come to terms now.

697
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:15,605
You want the portrait.
Perfectly understandable.

698
00:46:15,705 --> 00:46:19,108
I want my possessions--
my vase, my clock and my screen.

699
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:21,509
Also perfectly understandable.
Now, if you--

700
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:23,509
Get going.

701
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:28,214
You better watch out, McPherson,
or you'll end up in a psychiatric ward.

702
00:46:28,214 --> 00:46:32,416
I don't think they've ever had a patient
who fell in love with a corpse.

703
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,780
What are you doing here?

704
00:48:07,082 --> 00:48:08,984
You're alive.

705
00:48:09,084 --> 00:48:12,387
If you don't get out at once,
I'm going to call the police.

706
00:48:12,486 --> 00:48:14,888
You are Laura Hunt,
aren't you?

707
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:18,491
Aren't you?

708
00:48:18,591 --> 00:48:21,393
- I'm going to call the police.
- Well, I am the police.

709
00:48:23,094 --> 00:48:25,296
Mark McPherson.

710
00:48:26,496 --> 00:48:28,598
What's this all about?

711
00:48:28,598 --> 00:48:30,900
Don't you know?

712
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,602
- Don't you know what's happened?
- No.

713
00:48:34,602 --> 00:48:37,304
Haven't you seen the papers?
Where have you been?

714
00:48:37,404 --> 00:48:41,606
Up in the country.
I-- I don't get a newspaper.

715
00:48:41,706 --> 00:48:45,710
- Haven't you got a radio?
- It was broken.

716
00:48:45,909 --> 00:48:47,811
What--

717
00:49:05,924 --> 00:49:08,626
Somebody was murdered
in this room.

718
00:49:08,726 --> 00:49:10,626
Do you have any idea
who it was?

719
00:49:10,727 --> 00:49:12,629
No.

720
00:49:12,728 --> 00:49:15,330
Who had a key
to your apartment?

721
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,331
Nobody.

722
00:49:17,431 --> 00:49:19,333
Are you sure?

723
00:49:20,433 --> 00:49:24,237
- When did it happen?
- Friday night.

724
00:49:27,138 --> 00:49:29,140
What are you
going to do now?

725
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,442
Find out
who was murdered...

726
00:49:31,442 --> 00:49:34,645
and then find the murderer.

727
00:49:37,046 --> 00:49:40,548
You'd better take off those wet clothes.
You might catch cold.

728
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,852
Yeah.

729
00:49:56,459 --> 00:49:58,360
I found this in my closet.

730
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,461
It's Diane Redfern's.

731
00:50:00,561 --> 00:50:03,764
It wasn't here when I left.
She's one of our models.

732
00:50:03,764 --> 00:50:06,066
Just about my size.

733
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:09,069
Beautiful, wasn't she?

734
00:50:09,168 --> 00:50:11,269
Do you suppose--

735
00:50:15,673 --> 00:50:17,674
Sit down, please.

736
00:50:21,777 --> 00:50:24,679
This is Monday night.
You left on Friday.

737
00:50:24,779 --> 00:50:28,581
- Rather a long weekend, isn't it?
- Yes.

738
00:50:28,681 --> 00:50:30,683
What train did you take?

739
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,683
The 7:26.

740
00:50:32,784 --> 00:50:35,886
- See anybody you knew on the train?
- No.

741
00:50:35,986 --> 00:50:40,190
- Then what?
- Then I got off the train at Norwalk.

742
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:43,693
- Saw nobody you knew at the station either?
- No.

743
00:50:43,892 --> 00:50:48,095
- Go on. - Then I went to the
garage where I keep my car.

744
00:50:48,095 --> 00:50:51,998
It's a private garage.
Nobody saw me there either.

745
00:50:52,098 --> 00:50:54,099
Then I drove to my house.

746
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:57,001
You were there three days.
What did you do?

747
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,703
Work in my garden.

748
00:50:59,804 --> 00:51:01,804
You didn't go out
in all that time?

749
00:51:01,905 --> 00:51:05,607
No. I had everything
I needed in the house.

750
00:51:05,707 --> 00:51:07,909
- Nobody came to see you?
- Nobody.

751
00:51:08,008 --> 00:51:09,909
I went there to be alone.

752
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:13,413
Police were there on Saturday.
There was no one in the house.

753
00:51:14,514 --> 00:51:18,117
Oh, yes. Saturday,
I took a long walk.

754
00:51:18,216 --> 00:51:20,218
I walked for hours
in the woods.

755
00:51:20,418 --> 00:51:25,421
Mm-hmm. You were going to
marry Shelby Carpenter this week.

756
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,423
Thursday, if I'm not mistaken.

757
00:51:28,923 --> 00:51:30,825
Yes.

758
00:51:30,925 --> 00:51:33,827
Yet you went away
just before your wedding...

759
00:51:34,027 --> 00:51:37,129
for a long weekend
to be alone.

760
00:51:37,229 --> 00:51:39,631
I was tired.
I'd been working hard.

761
00:51:39,631 --> 00:51:43,033
You know Shelby Carpenter has a key to
this apartment. Why didn't you tell me?

762
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,534
I know nothing of the sort.
He hasn't.

763
00:51:45,534 --> 00:51:47,636
How else did the girl
get into the apartment?

764
00:51:47,636 --> 00:51:50,738
You knew she was in love with Carpenter,
that he'd given her your cigarette case.

765
00:51:50,738 --> 00:51:52,840
You know all that,
don't you?

766
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,742
I knew that she was in love with him.
She told me so herself.

767
00:51:55,742 --> 00:51:58,945
- When did she tell you?
- At lunch last Friday.

768
00:51:58,945 --> 00:52:02,747
I also know she meant nothing to Shelby.
I understand him better than you do.

769
00:52:02,747 --> 00:52:05,149
She was found in your
dressing gown and slippers.

770
00:52:05,149 --> 00:52:07,950
That's hardly the regulation costume
for an impersonal chat...

771
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,852
between a man and woman
who mean nothing to each other.

772
00:52:10,852 --> 00:52:13,755
Did you know or did you suspect he was
going to bring her here Friday night?

773
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:16,656
How could I? I don't know that he
brought her here. Neither do you.

774
00:52:16,656 --> 00:52:19,058
- You merely assume it.
- What other assumption is possible?

775
00:52:19,058 --> 00:52:22,561
Do you love Carpenter so much you'd risk
your own safety to protect him?

776
00:52:22,561 --> 00:52:25,463
My own safety?
Do you suspect me?

777
00:52:25,463 --> 00:52:28,665
I suspect nobody and everybody.
I'm merely trying to get at the truth.

778
00:52:28,765 --> 00:52:30,968
I see you have been trying
to get at the truth.

779
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:33,769
You've read things I never meant
anyone else to look at.

780
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:35,871
Strictly routine.

781
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:37,871
I'm sorry. Really.

782
00:52:40,674 --> 00:52:43,576
I'd better be going. I'll see you
in the morning, Miss Hunt.

783
00:52:43,776 --> 00:52:47,778
Oh, I must ask you not to leave
the house or use the phone.

784
00:52:47,878 --> 00:52:51,281
But-- But I've got
to let my friends know I'm alive.

785
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,882
Sorry, Miss Hunt,
but I must insist you do as I say.

786
00:52:53,982 --> 00:52:56,885
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

787
00:52:56,985 --> 00:53:00,587
But if anything should happen
to you this time, I wouldn't like it.

788
00:53:01,588 --> 00:53:03,589
All right.
I promise.

789
00:53:03,689 --> 00:53:06,592
There's one more thing.
You may as well know what I know--

790
00:53:06,692 --> 00:53:08,593
some of it, at any rate.

791
00:53:08,694 --> 00:53:12,096
It'll save time and a lot
of unnecessary fencing.

792
00:53:12,196 --> 00:53:14,897
I know that you went away
to make up your mind...

793
00:53:17,999 --> 00:53:21,502
whether you'd marry
Shelby Carpenter or-- or not.

794
00:53:22,803 --> 00:53:25,404
What did you decide?
I want the truth.

795
00:53:27,606 --> 00:53:29,808
I decided
not to marry him.

796
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:33,611
I'll see you in the morning.
Good night.

797
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:35,612
Good night.

798
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:53,024
Really?
Does McPherson know that?

799
00:53:53,124 --> 00:53:55,826
Uh-huh. Well, okay.
Good-bye.

800
00:53:57,226 --> 00:53:59,729
Say, Mark, that was
the medical examiner's report.

801
00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:03,130
It wasn't Laura Hunt. It was Diane
Redfern that was bumped off upstairs.

802
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:05,834
- Kinda balls things up, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

803
00:54:05,933 --> 00:54:08,235
Say, you're not taking it too hard.

804
00:54:08,336 --> 00:54:10,637
Wait a minute.

805
00:54:10,837 --> 00:54:13,239
- Hello?
- This is Laura. I've--

806
00:54:13,338 --> 00:54:15,341
Don't say anything on the phone.
Meet me right away.

807
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,442
I'll wait for you in my car
in front of Bullitt's.

808
00:54:18,543 --> 00:54:20,544
- Was that--
- Yeah.

809
00:54:20,644 --> 00:54:22,945
Dames are always
pulling a switch on you.

810
00:54:23,045 --> 00:54:24,946
Stand by.

811
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:44,360
You follow her.
I'm gonna tail him.

812
00:55:36,796 --> 00:55:39,498
Are you taking it down
or putting it away, Carpenter?

813
00:55:52,008 --> 00:55:55,410
- It's been fired lately.
- Yes. I killed some rabbits with it.

814
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:58,212
- When?
- Oh, a while back. I don't know exactly.

815
00:55:58,312 --> 00:56:00,313
You know about guns,
don't you?

816
00:56:00,413 --> 00:56:03,115
- Yes.
- How come you didn't clean it afterward?

817
00:56:03,314 --> 00:56:05,917
I don't know.
I forgot, I suppose.

818
00:56:06,018 --> 00:56:09,618
- Your initials?
- Yes. I gave it to Laura for protection.

819
00:56:09,819 --> 00:56:12,022
She didn't want it,
but I insisted.

820
00:56:12,221 --> 00:56:14,522
This house is rather isolated,
as you see.

821
00:56:14,923 --> 00:56:17,424
- Did you teach her how to use it?
- No.

822
00:56:17,525 --> 00:56:21,027
- Does she know how?
- I don't know. It didn't occur to me to ask.

823
00:56:21,227 --> 00:56:23,328
You're a vague sort of a fellow,
aren't you, Carpenter?

824
00:56:23,328 --> 00:56:27,132
I've spent very little time in observing
my own character, Mr. McPherson.

825
00:56:27,132 --> 00:56:29,934
You haven't borrowed it lately?
You didn't just bring it back tonight?

826
00:56:29,934 --> 00:56:33,937
You followed me here.
You saw me come in. You ought to know.

827
00:56:33,937 --> 00:56:37,638
You, uh, realize
the spot you're in, Carpenter?

828
00:56:37,738 --> 00:56:39,641
You took that poor girl
to Miss Hunt's apartment.

829
00:56:39,841 --> 00:56:42,342
You knew all along
it was she who was murdered.

830
00:56:44,143 --> 00:56:47,445
Didn't you know Laura Hunt would come
back any day and spill the whole thing?

831
00:56:49,147 --> 00:56:50,747
Or did you plan
to kill her too...

832
00:56:50,747 --> 00:56:54,350
hide the body someplace
and cover up your first crime?

833
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:57,853
You're being fantastic,
McPherson.

834
00:56:57,952 --> 00:57:00,555
You took a bottle of Black Pony
to her house Friday night.

835
00:57:00,655 --> 00:57:02,758
I took it there
over a week ago.

836
00:57:02,856 --> 00:57:06,259
Bessie said it wasn't there Friday
night. It was Saturday morning.

837
00:57:06,259 --> 00:57:08,460
I can't help what Bessie said.

838
00:57:10,962 --> 00:57:13,864
- Where's the key to her apartment?
- I haven't got it.

839
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:18,867
- What did you do with it,
give it back to her tonight? - I never had one.

840
00:57:18,867 --> 00:57:21,670
You didn't take the bottle
of scotch to her house Friday night.

841
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,971
You haven't got a key to her apartment.
How did you get in?

842
00:57:23,971 --> 00:57:25,973
- Well, I--
- You had a key, and I know it.

843
00:57:26,072 --> 00:57:28,473
- Now, come on, Carpenter. Spill it.
- I--

844
00:57:28,574 --> 00:57:32,978
Laura kept a duplicate key
at her office. I went over and got it.

845
00:57:33,077 --> 00:57:37,182
I'd asked Diane to dine with me. I wanted
to have it out with her once and for all.

846
00:57:37,281 --> 00:57:41,783
You know, she thought-- Well,
she thought she was in love with me.

847
00:57:41,884 --> 00:57:45,086
Well, we couldn't go on talking
in public places. She was too upset.

848
00:57:45,286 --> 00:57:47,788
I couldn't go to her room, and I didn't
want to take her to my hotel.

849
00:57:47,788 --> 00:57:50,589
- So we went to Laura's.
- Yeah?

850
00:57:50,589 --> 00:57:52,492
We talked there
for about three hours...

851
00:57:52,592 --> 00:57:55,994
- and then the doorbell rang and--
- Go on.

852
00:57:56,094 --> 00:57:58,896
Diane was frightened.
But knowing Laura as I've known her...

853
00:57:58,896 --> 00:58:00,997
I've learned to be
surprised at nothing.

854
00:58:00,997 --> 00:58:04,500
- What do you mean by that? - Her friends
would come to her with their troubles...

855
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,901
at all hours
of the day or night.

856
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:09,404
I asked Diane
to answer the door.

857
00:58:09,404 --> 00:58:13,406
- Why didn't you go yourself? - Supposing
one of Laura's friends had found me there.

858
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:16,107
- Why open the door at all?
- They must have seen the light.

859
00:58:16,107 --> 00:58:18,909
What about the girl? Diane--
what about her reputation?

860
00:58:18,909 --> 00:58:22,812
I asked her to tell them Laura had let
her the apartment while she was away.

861
00:58:22,812 --> 00:58:25,013
Anybody that knew Laura
would have believed that.

862
00:58:25,013 --> 00:58:28,416
- Yeah. Go on.
- Well, then the doorbell rang again.

863
00:58:28,516 --> 00:58:31,318
I could hear Diane's mules--
Laura's they were--

864
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:34,319
clattering across the bare boards
between the rugs.

865
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:37,522
Then there was a moment's silence
and then a shot.

866
00:58:38,123 --> 00:58:40,824
It was an awful explosion.

867
00:58:40,925 --> 00:58:43,927
By the time I reached her,
the door was closed.

868
00:58:44,028 --> 00:58:47,129
- She lay there on the floor.
- Did you go out to see who it was?

869
00:58:47,129 --> 00:58:50,531
No. I was too confused, too horrified,
incapable of doing anything.

870
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:53,633
The room was dark. I saw only
a vague heap lying on the floor.

871
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:57,937
I-- I don't think
I fully grasped the situation.

872
00:58:57,937 --> 00:59:01,039
I think I called her name,
but I'm not sure. I--

873
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:04,742
I remember kneeling on the floor,
feeling her heart.

874
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:07,943
My first instinct
was to call the police.

875
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,945
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.

876
00:59:10,145 --> 00:59:13,347
Or rather, I was afraid--
not only for myself, but for Laura.

877
00:59:13,347 --> 00:59:17,851
In a panicky sort of way, I felt I must
keep out of this to keep Laura out of it.

878
00:59:17,851 --> 00:59:20,253
I know now how foolish
and hopeless it was...

879
00:59:20,253 --> 00:59:22,955
but there was only
one thing on my mind--

880
00:59:22,955 --> 00:59:25,856
the safety of a person whose life
was dearer to me than my own.

881
00:59:25,856 --> 00:59:27,758
Don't you understand that?

882
00:59:27,758 --> 00:59:30,260
Did you think
Laura had done it?

883
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:33,161
- Did you?
- I don't remember what I thought.

884
00:59:33,161 --> 00:59:36,164
- Do you think so now?
- No.

885
00:59:36,164 --> 00:59:38,365
- But you didn't?
- No.

886
00:59:38,365 --> 00:59:41,667
On Saturday, when our men went to the
hotel to tell you that Laura was dead...

887
00:59:41,767 --> 00:59:45,670
- you seemed sincerely shocked.
- I was. I hadn't expected that mistake.

888
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:47,871
But you had your alibi ready
no matter who was dead.

889
00:59:47,871 --> 00:59:50,773
Yet you knew the minute
Laura got back it wouldn't stick.

890
00:59:50,773 --> 00:59:53,576
Don't you see? I was incapable
of thinking that far ahead.

891
00:59:53,576 --> 00:59:56,179
I was incapable
of thinking at all.

892
00:59:56,179 --> 00:59:59,680
I was groping for some way
to keep Laura's name out of it.

893
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:04,183
I was heartbroken about Diane
and panic-stricken about Laura.

894
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,885
I haven't slept a full two hours
since this thing happened.

895
01:00:06,885 --> 01:00:09,987
Let's get back to the present. What did
you and Laura talk about tonight?

896
01:00:09,987 --> 01:00:13,189
I told her the whole story,
just as I've told you.

897
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:16,792
She phoned you after she promised me
she wouldn't call anybody.

898
01:00:16,892 --> 01:00:20,194
- What did she want? - It's perfectly
natural she should want to see me...

899
01:00:20,194 --> 01:00:21,894
especially
after what's happened.

900
01:00:21,995 --> 01:00:25,097
Why don't you tell the truth? She sent
you here to get rid of this gun.

901
01:00:25,097 --> 01:00:28,900
She did not. It was my own idea.
She doesn't even know I'm here.

902
01:00:34,904 --> 01:00:39,208
- It works fine, doesn't it?
- Yes. Did you think it wouldn't?

903
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:41,810
I hoped it wouldn't.
All right. Let's go.

904
01:00:43,211 --> 01:00:47,613
- Well, am I under arrest?
- No, but you're not to leave town...

905
01:00:47,613 --> 01:00:50,315
and it would be
foolish of you to try it.

906
01:01:07,427 --> 01:01:10,029
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

907
01:01:12,931 --> 01:01:14,833
- What's that?
- Breakfast.

908
01:01:14,933 --> 01:01:17,634
You didn't buy any food
when you went out last night.

909
01:01:23,238 --> 01:01:27,241
I'll fix some bacon and eggs.
Can you make coffee?

910
01:01:27,241 --> 01:01:31,043
Suppose you set the table
while I get breakfast.

911
01:01:31,143 --> 01:01:33,145
Do you always sound like this
in the morning?

912
01:01:33,145 --> 01:01:35,146
Don't tell me
you can cook.

913
01:01:35,246 --> 01:01:39,450
My mother always listened sympathetically
to my dreams of a career...

914
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:41,952
and then taught me
another recipe.

915
01:01:42,152 --> 01:01:44,653
Shh! Don't move.

916
01:01:49,557 --> 01:01:51,958
It's all right, Bessie.
It's all right, Bessie.

917
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:55,561
She's alive.

918
01:01:55,662 --> 01:01:57,662
It's all been
a mistake, Bessie.

919
01:01:57,763 --> 01:02:00,564
I'm not a ghost. Really.

920
01:02:00,664 --> 01:02:03,566
I found you,
and you were dead.

921
01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:05,667
It was Miss Redfern's
body you found.

922
01:02:07,869 --> 01:02:10,071
How about
taking over here--

923
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,572
fixing us some
coffee and eggs.

924
01:02:12,673 --> 01:02:16,976
But I-- I saw it
with my own eyes.

925
01:02:17,077 --> 01:02:19,378
I-- I don't
understand it.

926
01:02:19,478 --> 01:02:22,379
Have you ever
heard a ghost ask for eggs?

927
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,481
No, miss.

928
01:02:24,581 --> 01:02:26,483
You'll be all right,
Bessie.

929
01:02:36,489 --> 01:02:39,792
Somebody should have warned her.
Poor Bessie.

930
01:02:39,992 --> 01:02:43,094
By the way, I've asked Waldo Lydecker
to come here this morning.

931
01:02:43,194 --> 01:02:45,495
- Did you tell him?
- No.

932
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,597
Why not?
It's brutal.

933
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:51,000
I'm not doing it for fun.

934
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:54,502
Why did you break your promise
and go out and see Shelby last night?

935
01:02:54,602 --> 01:02:56,803
You forced me
to give you my word.

936
01:02:56,904 --> 01:02:59,305
I never have been and I
never will be bound by anything...

937
01:02:59,305 --> 01:03:01,707
I don't do
of my own free will.

938
01:03:01,707 --> 01:03:04,509
Redfern was in love
with Carpenter.

939
01:03:04,609 --> 01:03:06,510
You admitted that
last night.

940
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:09,512
- May I have a match, please?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

941
01:03:09,512 --> 01:03:13,015
I also told you that
he wasn't in love with her.

942
01:03:13,214 --> 01:03:15,616
Just sit still.

943
01:03:23,122 --> 01:03:25,924
Hello, Lieutenant.

944
01:03:26,025 --> 01:03:28,626
- Morning, my darling.
- Hello, dear.

945
01:03:28,726 --> 01:03:31,427
Ah. Thank you.

946
01:03:31,528 --> 01:03:33,630
Oh. It's on again.

947
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:37,532
Do I have to get a permit from
the police department to kiss
my fiancee good morning?

948
01:03:37,532 --> 01:03:39,533
So he made you
change your mind.

949
01:03:39,634 --> 01:03:41,935
Speaking of changing one's mind,
Mr. McPherson...

950
01:03:41,935 --> 01:03:44,136
I have just come
from my lawyer.

951
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:47,038
Yeah? Did he tell you how much
you'll get off for good behavior?

952
01:03:47,038 --> 01:03:49,240
No, but he told me that anything
I may have said last night...

953
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:52,242
was said under duress
and can't be used against me.

954
01:03:52,343 --> 01:03:54,343
Besides, none of it was true.

955
01:03:54,444 --> 01:03:58,247
Smart lawyer you've got. Maybe he told you
how that scotch got up here Friday night...

956
01:03:58,247 --> 01:04:00,248
after you'd bought it
at Mosconi's.

957
01:04:00,248 --> 01:04:02,449
Maybe it was the lawyer
who brought Diane Redfern up here.

958
01:04:02,449 --> 01:04:04,451
Maybe--

959
01:04:09,954 --> 01:04:11,657
Well, McPherson...

960
01:04:11,756 --> 01:04:14,558
have you thought over
the deal I suggested?

961
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,763
Waldo.

962
01:04:20,862 --> 01:04:22,763
Waldo.

963
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:28,567
Right-hand pocket.

964
01:04:28,567 --> 01:04:30,670
You want a doctor?

965
01:04:30,769 --> 01:04:33,272
Right-hand pocket.

966
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:35,873
We'd better take him
into the bedroom.

967
01:04:47,881 --> 01:04:49,782
- What--
- Don't try and say anything, dear.

968
01:04:49,882 --> 01:04:51,884
Just be quiet.

969
01:04:54,386 --> 01:04:56,487
I think this is
carrying things too far.

970
01:04:56,586 --> 01:04:58,989
Your methods are vicious.
There ought to be a law against it.

971
01:04:58,989 --> 01:05:01,591
- Yeah?
- How does he feel now?

972
01:05:01,591 --> 01:05:03,692
It was a terrible shock.
Poor darling.

973
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:05,794
Don't tell me you're in love
with him too.

974
01:05:05,794 --> 01:05:07,996
Look here, fella. You're not to talk
that way to Miss Hunt.

975
01:05:07,996 --> 01:05:10,197
Shut up. Why do you cover up
for a guy like him?

976
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:12,899
- Don't answer him, Laura.
- What story did he tell you last night?

977
01:05:12,899 --> 01:05:15,600
- Don't answer him.
Let him talk to our lawyer. - Our lawyer?

978
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,702
- So now you're covering up for each other.
- Look at him, Laura.

979
01:05:17,702 --> 01:05:20,504
He's beginning to crack up.
He'd use anything to make an arrest...

980
01:05:20,504 --> 01:05:22,605
just so he can be a big shot
in the headlines.

981
01:05:22,605 --> 01:05:24,807
I've got enough on you
to arrest you right now.

982
01:05:24,807 --> 01:05:26,808
Quick, McPherson,
the handcuffs.

983
01:05:26,808 --> 01:05:29,310
- Trundle him off to the hoosegow.
- You keep out of this.

984
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:32,712
- You'll look nice in bracelets. - Why don't
you get down on all fours again, Waldo?

985
01:05:32,712 --> 01:05:35,413
It's the only time you've ever
kept your mouth shut.

986
01:05:35,413 --> 01:05:38,516
I hope you'll forgive
my wee touch of epilepsy, my dear.

987
01:05:38,516 --> 01:05:40,618
It's an old family custom.

988
01:05:40,718 --> 01:05:44,021
Well, McPherson, what does
Laura's resurrection do to you?

989
01:05:44,021 --> 01:05:47,122
Too bad Diane Redfern
can't be resurrected.

990
01:05:47,122 --> 01:05:49,724
I'm afraid I've interrupted
what you call "a pinch."

991
01:05:49,724 --> 01:05:52,826
Do your duty, McPherson.

992
01:05:52,826 --> 01:05:56,128
You know, Lydecker,
you've made me change my mind.

993
01:05:56,128 --> 01:05:58,131
- For the moment.
- Well, in that case...

994
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:00,331
we'll have time
for a little get-together.

995
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:04,335
- You'd better order some liquor
and some food, Laura. - What for?

996
01:06:04,435 --> 01:06:06,436
People are coming
to celebrate your return.

997
01:06:06,536 --> 01:06:08,637
Ann and Bullitt and Corey.
Everybody.

998
01:06:08,736 --> 01:06:11,939
- Who asked them to come?
- I did, when I was in there.

999
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:14,042
I phoned my man,
and he's calling everyone.

1000
01:06:14,142 --> 01:06:18,144
- Why did you do that, Waldo?
- A sense of the fitness of things, my dear.

1001
01:06:18,144 --> 01:06:21,947
Perhaps our friend can weave all the
loose ends into a noose. Eh, McPherson?

1002
01:06:21,947 --> 01:06:25,049
Sorry you went to all that trouble.
I've already called them.

1003
01:06:28,952 --> 01:06:31,153
You're working yourself
to death, darling.

1004
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:34,655
- I haven't had a moment with you all day.
- It's a very thirsty crowd.

1005
01:06:34,655 --> 01:06:37,157
Oh, after all,
it isn't your homecoming.

1006
01:06:37,157 --> 01:06:39,760
Aren't you being
a little bit nasty, Ann?

1007
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,161
I feel nasty
when I don't see you.

1008
01:06:42,161 --> 01:06:45,563
Well, you look very sweet. That's
a completely wonderful hat, darling.

1009
01:06:45,563 --> 01:06:48,665
Now, if you'll forgive me,
Laura wants a cocktail.

1010
01:06:48,665 --> 01:06:51,067
- So do I.
- Well, here you go.

1011
01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:54,569
Shelby, why don't you
come to your senses?

1012
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:58,172
You know it's all over between you
and Laura, or it soon will be.

1013
01:06:58,273 --> 01:07:01,574
But you haven't lost me.
Why don't we get married now?

1014
01:07:01,775 --> 01:07:04,477
- Ann, dear, you don't seem to
realize the situation. - Yes, but I do.

1015
01:07:04,577 --> 01:07:07,880
That's why you need me. We'll get
the best lawyer that money can buy.

1016
01:07:07,979 --> 01:07:11,781
When it's all over, we'll go away-- anywhere
you want-- and forget about all this.

1017
01:07:11,781 --> 01:07:15,383
Thanks, Ann, but you see,
Laura needs me. Sorry.

1018
01:07:17,786 --> 01:07:19,787
Uh-uh.

1019
01:07:21,988 --> 01:07:24,291
- Laura.
- Thanks.

1020
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:27,193
If you don't mind,
I'd like a word with Miss Hunt.

1021
01:07:27,193 --> 01:07:29,795
I don't mind.
Talk to her as much as you like.

1022
01:07:31,195 --> 01:07:34,498
- I see he's taking a new tack.
- What do you mean?

1023
01:07:34,498 --> 01:07:38,400
Trying to make you like him
to make you talk.

1024
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,503
Shelby, tell me,
why did you go to--

1025
01:07:43,104 --> 01:07:45,105
Excuse me.

1026
01:07:46,406 --> 01:07:48,907
Why did you go
to the cottage last night?

1027
01:07:48,907 --> 01:07:51,109
But don't you know?
I was afraid...

1028
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:53,910
you wouldn't think
of hiding that shotgun.

1029
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:57,713
- What shotgun?
- The one I gave you.

1030
01:07:57,713 --> 01:08:00,216
You don't have to lie
to me, darling.

1031
01:08:00,216 --> 01:08:02,317
I'll stand by you.

1032
01:08:09,221 --> 01:08:11,523
What's the matter,
Laura?

1033
01:08:11,723 --> 01:08:15,026
Oh, I guess I'm just nervous.
That's all.

1034
01:08:15,026 --> 01:08:17,827
So am I.

1035
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:20,229
McPherson suspects Shelby.

1036
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,331
He seems to suspect me too.

1037
01:08:24,432 --> 01:08:26,433
And so do
some of my friends.

1038
01:08:26,534 --> 01:08:28,534
You?
Don't be absurd.

1039
01:08:28,635 --> 01:08:31,336
- You could never do a thing like that.
- And Shelby?

1040
01:08:31,437 --> 01:08:33,439
Oh, I don't think
he did it.

1041
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,441
But he's capable of it.

1042
01:08:37,241 --> 01:08:40,043
Are you as interested in McPherson
as he is in you?

1043
01:08:40,043 --> 01:08:42,145
But, Ann, I only
met him last night.

1044
01:08:42,245 --> 01:08:44,547
That's more than
long enough sometimes.

1045
01:08:44,646 --> 01:08:49,250
Anyway, he's better for you
than Shelby. Anybody is.

1046
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:52,751
- Shelby's better for me.
- Why?

1047
01:08:52,751 --> 01:08:55,754
Because I can afford him,
and I understand him.

1048
01:08:56,854 --> 01:08:59,857
He's no good,
but he's what I want.

1049
01:08:59,957 --> 01:09:02,858
I'm not a nice person,
Laura. Neither is he.

1050
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:06,561
He knows I know he's...
just what he is.

1051
01:09:06,661 --> 01:09:09,664
He also knows
that I don't care.

1052
01:09:09,864 --> 01:09:14,268
We belong together because we're
both weak and can't seem to help it.

1053
01:09:14,468 --> 01:09:17,270
That's why I know
he's capable of murder.

1054
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:19,371
He's like me.

1055
01:09:21,371 --> 01:09:23,274
No, dear, I didn't...

1056
01:09:24,273 --> 01:09:26,275
but I thought of it.

1057
01:09:43,588 --> 01:09:47,491
Hello? Yes. Yes.

1058
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:50,192
Oh, it's for you, Lieutenant.

1059
01:09:50,292 --> 01:09:52,694
Thank you, Bessie.

1060
01:09:52,694 --> 01:09:54,695
McPherson.

1061
01:09:55,796 --> 01:09:58,399
Yeah, I know.
Don't worry.

1062
01:09:58,498 --> 01:10:00,900
I told you I'd bring in
the killer today.

1063
01:10:02,301 --> 01:10:04,802
Yeah. I was just gonna
make the arrest when you called.

1064
01:10:04,802 --> 01:10:08,504
No, I can't tell you now.
I'm not alone.

1065
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:12,707
You'll see when I come in.

1066
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:14,809
Right. See you later.

1067
01:10:34,723 --> 01:10:36,724
All right. Let's go.

1068
01:10:36,824 --> 01:10:38,225
- You mean--
- Yeah.

1069
01:10:38,326 --> 01:10:40,327
Oh, no!

1070
01:10:42,229 --> 01:10:44,530
No. No, no.

1071
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:46,631
Not Miss Hunt.

1072
01:10:46,832 --> 01:10:48,733
Please!

1073
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:51,836
Thank you, Bessie.

1074
01:10:52,836 --> 01:10:54,838
Thank you.

1075
01:10:56,338 --> 01:10:59,741
Now will you please be good enough
to go and get me my things?

1076
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,142
- Yes, miss.
- Laura.

1077
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:06,345
Don't worry, darling.
Let them accuse you.

1078
01:11:06,446 --> 01:11:08,346
We'll fight them.

1079
01:11:08,447 --> 01:11:12,149
I have every weapon--
money, connections, prestige.

1080
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:17,554
And my column. Every day, millions will
read about you and rally to your defense.

1081
01:11:17,554 --> 01:11:20,355
You talk as if you wanted
to see her tried for murder.

1082
01:11:20,355 --> 01:11:25,858
Yes. Rather than let you blacken
her name with suspicions and rumors.

1083
01:11:25,858 --> 01:11:31,263
Try to prove her guilty. Get on the witness
stand with your poor shreds of evidence.

1084
01:11:31,263 --> 01:11:35,466
I'll expose your cheap methods
you used on her.

1085
01:11:35,566 --> 01:11:38,568
- Thank you, Bessie.
- Laura, I told you to watch out for this fella.

1086
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:40,969
- Can we go now?
- I warned you.

1087
01:11:43,071 --> 01:11:46,473
It's too bad you didn't
open that door Friday night, Carpenter.

1088
01:11:46,473 --> 01:11:49,475
- Wait a minute.
- Shelby!

1089
01:11:51,978 --> 01:11:54,079
Oh, did he hurt you, darling?

1090
01:11:54,178 --> 01:11:56,180
Darling.

1091
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:59,381
Ann.

1092
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:06,087
Come in.

1093
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:08,188
Sit down.

1094
01:12:09,289 --> 01:12:11,491
- That'll be all, Gallagher.
- Yes, sir.

1095
01:12:14,893 --> 01:12:19,196
All right. Let's have it.
Look at me.

1096
01:12:21,297 --> 01:12:23,898
What are you trying to do,
force a confession out of me?

1097
01:12:23,898 --> 01:12:26,701
You've been holding out,
and I want to know why.

1098
01:12:26,701 --> 01:12:29,303
It'll be easier for you
if you tell the truth.

1099
01:12:30,004 --> 01:12:32,505
What difference
does it make what I say?

1100
01:12:32,505 --> 01:12:34,707
You've made up your mind
I'm guilty.

1101
01:12:34,707 --> 01:12:38,510
- Are you?
- Don't tell me you have any doubts.

1102
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:41,312
Since you--
Oh, I can't.

1103
01:12:41,312 --> 01:12:44,213
Please. Do I have to have
those lights in my face?

1104
01:12:49,717 --> 01:12:54,020
Thanks. No, I didn't
kill Diane Redfern...

1105
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:56,221
or anyone else.

1106
01:12:57,522 --> 01:12:59,925
Then why--

1107
01:13:00,024 --> 01:13:03,327
Why did you tell me the radio
at your country place was broken?

1108
01:13:03,327 --> 01:13:05,628
- Because it was broken.
- Not when I tried it.

1109
01:13:05,728 --> 01:13:08,830
Just as I was leaving the village,
I asked the local handyman to fix it.

1110
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:12,834
- How did he get in? - I always leave a
key under the flowerpot on the porch.

1111
01:13:12,834 --> 01:13:17,836
You're too intelligent to make up
something I could check so easily...

1112
01:13:17,836 --> 01:13:22,841
but you're intelligent enough to have
broken it yourself to strengthen your story.

1113
01:13:22,841 --> 01:13:26,844
The main thing I want to know is why you
pulled that switch on me about Carpenter.

1114
01:13:26,844 --> 01:13:30,446
You told me last night
you decided not to marry him.

1115
01:13:30,446 --> 01:13:34,949
- Yes, I guess I did.
- But today it was on again. Why?

1116
01:13:34,949 --> 01:13:38,852
Well, I--
I changed my mind.

1117
01:13:38,852 --> 01:13:43,854
What are you trying to hide? Don't you
realize you're involved in a murder?

1118
01:13:43,854 --> 01:13:47,358
You've got yourself in a jam it's not
going to be easy to get out of...

1119
01:13:47,358 --> 01:13:49,159
unless you're on the level
with me.

1120
01:13:49,159 --> 01:13:51,661
This is no time for secrets.

1121
01:13:51,661 --> 01:13:53,762
Now, did you really decide
to call it off...

1122
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:57,865
or did you just tell me that because
you knew I wanted to hear it?

1123
01:14:01,568 --> 01:14:04,970
What went on between you and Carpenter
when you saw him last night?

1124
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:07,873
Did he persuade you to make up?

1125
01:14:08,272 --> 01:14:10,774
Or did you agree
to pretend you had?

1126
01:14:10,774 --> 01:14:14,275
- Was that it?
- Well, we-- That is, both of us thought--

1127
01:14:14,275 --> 01:14:17,379
He convinced you that if you
broke the engagement now...

1128
01:14:17,379 --> 01:14:19,980
people would think
you believed he was guilty.

1129
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:23,383
Yes, but now I know it was only
because he thought I was.

1130
01:14:23,383 --> 01:14:26,386
- Did you believe he was guilty?
- No. I'm sure he isn't.

1131
01:14:26,386 --> 01:14:29,488
But he'd gotten himself
into an awfully suspicious position...

1132
01:14:29,488 --> 01:14:33,589
and he's the sort of man that people are
always ready to believe the worst about.

1133
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:36,492
Are you in love with him?

1134
01:14:40,795 --> 01:14:43,297
I don't see how
I ever could have been.

1135
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,601
Come on.
You're going home.

1136
01:14:51,903 --> 01:14:55,405
- But I thought I was--
- That's-- That's what I wanted you to think.

1137
01:14:55,405 --> 01:14:58,708
You and a few others.
I didn't even book you.

1138
01:14:58,708 --> 01:15:01,010
You mean this was
some sort of a game?

1139
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:03,912
I was 99% certain
about you...

1140
01:15:03,912 --> 01:15:06,313
but I had to get rid of
that one percent doubt.

1141
01:15:06,313 --> 01:15:09,515
Wasn't there
an easier way to make sure?

1142
01:15:09,515 --> 01:15:13,418
I'd... reached a point
where I needed official surroundings.

1143
01:15:15,619 --> 01:15:18,221
Then it was worth it, Mark.

1144
01:15:20,622 --> 01:15:22,624
I'll call a cab for you.

1145
01:15:35,934 --> 01:15:38,035
Good night.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1146
01:15:38,135 --> 01:15:40,136
Good night, Mark.

1147
01:15:41,338 --> 01:15:43,338
I'm going over
to Lydecker's apartment.

1148
01:17:06,597 --> 01:17:08,698
It still doesn't
make sense to me, Laura.

1149
01:17:08,698 --> 01:17:11,400
He's playing some sort
of a game with you.

1150
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:14,402
- I don't think so.
- I don't deny that he's infatuated with you...

1151
01:17:14,402 --> 01:17:17,604
in some warped way
of his own.

1152
01:17:17,705 --> 01:17:21,807
But he isn't capable of any normal,
warm human relationship.

1153
01:17:21,807 --> 01:17:24,509
He's been dealing
with criminals too long.

1154
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:29,413
When you were unattainable--
when he thought you were dead--

1155
01:17:29,413 --> 01:17:31,314
that's when
he wanted you most.

1156
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:33,315
But he was glad
when I came back...

1157
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,517
as if he were
waiting for me.

1158
01:17:35,517 --> 01:17:38,919
Do you know what
he calls women? "Dames."

1159
01:17:38,919 --> 01:17:42,322
A "dame" in Washington Heights
got a fox fur out of him.

1160
01:17:42,322 --> 01:17:45,923
- His very words.
- That doesn't mean anything.

1161
01:17:45,923 --> 01:17:48,126
He isn't like that.

1162
01:17:48,226 --> 01:17:51,128
Laura, you have
one tragic weakness.

1163
01:17:51,228 --> 01:17:54,231
With you, a lean, strong body
is the measure of a man...

1164
01:17:54,431 --> 01:17:56,332
and you always get hurt.

1165
01:17:57,933 --> 01:18:00,535
No man is ever
going to hurt me again.

1166
01:18:00,635 --> 01:18:03,537
No one, not even you.

1167
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:07,039
I? Hurt you?

1168
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,241
Laura, look at me.

1169
01:18:11,542 --> 01:18:14,844
When a man has everything
in the world that he wants...

1170
01:18:14,944 --> 01:18:18,046
except what he wants most...

1171
01:18:18,146 --> 01:18:20,547
he loses his self-respect.

1172
01:18:20,647 --> 01:18:23,551
It makes him bitter, Laura.

1173
01:18:23,651 --> 01:18:26,753
He wants to hurt someone
as he's been hurt.

1174
01:18:28,354 --> 01:18:31,957
You were a long time
in finding out about Shelby...

1175
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:36,159
but... that's over now.

1176
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,962
We'll be back together again.

1177
01:18:39,962 --> 01:18:43,664
Haven't you heard of science's
newest triumph-- the doorbell?

1178
01:18:45,065 --> 01:18:46,967
I don't like to remind her.

1179
01:18:48,868 --> 01:18:53,571
- That was the murderer's signal.
- Did you eavesdrop too? I hope.

1180
01:18:53,671 --> 01:18:57,674
I thought you'd like to know. We
tested your shotgun. It isn't the one.

1181
01:18:57,774 --> 01:19:00,176
Now, that's what I call
a typical move--

1182
01:19:00,176 --> 01:19:03,278
a real key
to the man's character.

1183
01:19:03,278 --> 01:19:05,680
First he tells you that
he thinks you're innocent...

1184
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,881
then proceeds
to check up on you.

1185
01:19:07,881 --> 01:19:10,584
When I report that I think
she's innocent...

1186
01:19:10,584 --> 01:19:12,285
that's my own personal opinion.

1187
01:19:12,285 --> 01:19:15,087
When I submit proof, it becomes
the opinion of the department.

1188
01:19:15,087 --> 01:19:17,988
This entire maneuver could be a trick
to get you off your guard.

1189
01:19:17,988 --> 01:19:19,690
It could be, but it isn't.

1190
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:23,591
- I believe you, Mark.
- It's the same obvious pattern, Laura.

1191
01:19:23,591 --> 01:19:27,094
If McPherson weren't muscular and
handsome in a cheap sort of way...

1192
01:19:27,094 --> 01:19:29,397
you'd see through him
in a second.

1193
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:32,899
Waldo, I mean to be
as kind about this as I know how...

1194
01:19:32,899 --> 01:19:37,402
but I must tell you-you're the one who
follows the same obvious pattern.

1195
01:19:37,402 --> 01:19:39,904
First it was Jacoby, then Shelby.
And now I suppose--

1196
01:19:39,904 --> 01:19:42,505
- Laura, I-- - I don't think
we should see each other again.

1197
01:19:42,505 --> 01:19:46,609
- You're not yourself, darling.
- Yes, I am.

1198
01:19:46,609 --> 01:19:50,411
For the first time in ages,
I know what I'm doing.

1199
01:19:52,412 --> 01:19:54,614
Very well.

1200
01:19:54,715 --> 01:19:57,817
I hope you'll never regret
what promises to be...

1201
01:19:57,817 --> 01:20:00,418
a disgustingly
earthy relationship.

1202
01:20:01,918 --> 01:20:04,720
My congratulations, McPherson.

1203
01:20:04,821 --> 01:20:08,024
Listen to my broadcast
in 15 minutes.

1204
01:20:08,123 --> 01:20:10,925
I'm discussing
great lovers of history.

1205
01:20:30,538 --> 01:20:35,942
- It was the most difficult thing
I ever had to do in my life.

1206
01:20:36,042 --> 01:20:38,445
All I need is the gun.

1207
01:20:42,848 --> 01:20:46,851
- What are you doing?
- Do you know the combination to this thing?

1208
01:20:46,951 --> 01:20:50,553
- I never knew it had one.
- It must be somewhere. Oh.

1209
01:21:02,461 --> 01:21:06,565
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.

1210
01:21:06,764 --> 01:21:09,466
Waldo gave you that clock,
didn't he?

1211
01:21:09,566 --> 01:21:11,567
Yes.

1212
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:14,970
The doorbell rang...

1213
01:21:15,069 --> 01:21:18,273
and Diane Redfern
went to the door in your negligee.

1214
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:22,977
She opened the door.
The room was dark.

1215
01:21:24,476 --> 01:21:27,679
Waldo saw a girl standing there,
and he assumed it was you.

1216
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:30,581
He figured that if
he couldn't have you himself...

1217
01:21:30,581 --> 01:21:33,083
he was gonna make sure
that nobody else did.

1218
01:21:33,083 --> 01:21:34,984
So he let her have it...

1219
01:21:38,887 --> 01:21:40,788
with both barrels,
right in the face.

1220
01:21:42,789 --> 01:21:45,591
She fell here.

1221
01:21:45,691 --> 01:21:48,593
Waldo heard Shelby running
from the next room...

1222
01:21:48,693 --> 01:21:51,095
so he hid
in the stairway outside.

1223
01:21:52,697 --> 01:21:55,899
Shelby was scared,
so he ran out as fast as he could.

1224
01:21:55,899 --> 01:21:59,501
Then Waldo came back
and placed the gun in that clock.

1225
01:22:01,503 --> 01:22:03,404
I knew it.

1226
01:22:03,504 --> 01:22:06,006
I've felt it
ever since I came back...

1227
01:22:06,106 --> 01:22:08,508
but I didn't want
to believe it.

1228
01:22:08,607 --> 01:22:11,409
I couldn't make myself
believe that...

1229
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:14,311
Waldo was a murderer.

1230
01:22:14,411 --> 01:22:18,514
- Well, he is.
- He didn't really kill Diane Redfern.

1231
01:22:18,514 --> 01:22:20,715
- I killed her.
- What are you talking about?

1232
01:22:20,816 --> 01:22:25,219
But I did, Mark. I did as surely
as if I'd pulled the trigger myself.

1233
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:27,321
That's nonsense.
Forget it.

1234
01:22:27,421 --> 01:22:31,324
No, Mark, I can't.
I'm as guilty as he is--

1235
01:22:31,324 --> 01:22:35,926
not for anything I did,
but for what I didn't do.

1236
01:22:37,027 --> 01:22:41,431
But I couldn't help myself.
I owed him too much.

1237
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:48,735
I can understand that,
Laura...

1238
01:22:48,735 --> 01:22:52,538
but I can't understand why you've tried so
hard to protect Shelby these last few days.

1239
01:22:52,538 --> 01:22:54,939
I was nearly frantic for fear
you'd arrest Shelby.

1240
01:22:54,939 --> 01:22:58,041
I knew he wasn't guilty.
He hasn't enough courage to kill a fly.

1241
01:22:58,041 --> 01:23:01,244
And Waldo was doing everything
he could to incriminate him.

1242
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:03,547
It was his way
of getting rid of Shelby...

1243
01:23:03,547 --> 01:23:05,848
just as he did Jacoby.

1244
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:11,552
I must say, for a charming,
intelligent girl...

1245
01:23:11,552 --> 01:23:14,053
you've certainly surrounded yourself
with a remarkable collection of dopes.

1246
01:23:15,755 --> 01:23:18,857
Don't touch anything.
Fingerprints will be important.

1247
01:23:20,857 --> 01:23:22,960
I'll have the clock
picked up tomorrow.

1248
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,061
- What are you going to do?
- Arrest Waldo.

1249
01:23:25,061 --> 01:23:27,862
- Mark.
- Can't be helped.

1250
01:23:34,267 --> 01:23:36,870
That's to make sure
you're not disturbed.

1251
01:23:36,969 --> 01:23:39,371
If the doorbell rings,
don't answer it.

1252
01:23:39,471 --> 01:23:43,274
- I'll phone you in the morning.
- Good night, Mark.

1253
01:23:43,474 --> 01:23:46,576
Get some sleep. Forget
the whole thing like a bad dream.

1254
01:25:38,954 --> 01:25:43,057
And thus,
as history has proved, love is eternal.

1255
01:25:43,057 --> 01:25:47,060
It has been the strongest motivation
for human actions...

1256
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:49,461
throughout centuries.

1257
01:25:49,461 --> 01:25:51,862
Love is stronger than life.

1258
01:25:51,862 --> 01:25:54,466
It reaches beyond
the dark shadow of death.

1259
01:25:55,666 --> 01:25:58,067
I close this evening's
broadcast...

1260
01:25:58,168 --> 01:26:01,170
with some favorite lines
from Dowson.

1261
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:03,272
"Brief Life.'"

1262
01:26:05,072 --> 01:26:09,076
"They are not long,
the weeping and the laughter...

1263
01:26:09,275 --> 01:26:12,278
"love and desire
and hate.

1264
01:26:13,578 --> 01:26:16,080
"I think they have
no portion in us...

1265
01:26:16,181 --> 01:26:18,983
after we pass the gate.'"

1266
01:26:19,082 --> 01:26:22,685
- Who's tailing Lydecker?
- I was going to, when he came out.

1267
01:26:22,685 --> 01:26:25,587
- He left five minutes ago.
- He didn't come out this way.

1268
01:26:25,587 --> 01:26:28,989
Must've gone out the back way.
Come on. Let's check.

1269
01:26:28,989 --> 01:26:34,594
"They are
not long, the days of wine and roses.

1270
01:26:34,694 --> 01:26:38,796
"Out of a misty dream,
our path emerges for a while...

1271
01:26:38,896 --> 01:26:41,499
then closes within a dream.'"

1272
01:26:43,299 --> 01:26:45,500
- That's the way it is, isn't it, Laura?
- Waldo!

1273
01:26:45,601 --> 01:26:47,903
You have
heard the voice of Waldo Lydecker...

1274
01:26:48,003 --> 01:26:49,904
by electrical transcription.

1275
01:26:50,004 --> 01:26:54,207
Waldo, you've taken one life.
Isn't that enough?

1276
01:26:54,307 --> 01:26:58,910
The best part of myself--
that's what you are.

1277
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:01,812
Do you think I'm going to leave it
to the vulgar pawing...

1278
01:27:01,812 --> 01:27:05,115
of a second-rate detective
who thinks you're a dame?

1279
01:27:05,115 --> 01:27:08,417
Do you think I could bear the thought
of him holding you in his arms--

1280
01:27:08,417 --> 01:27:10,819
kissing you, loving you?

1281
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:14,120
Laura! It's Mark.
Open the door!

1282
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,123
- There he is now.
- Laura!

1283
01:27:16,222 --> 01:27:19,724
He'll find us together, Laura...

1284
01:27:19,724 --> 01:27:23,627
as we always have been, as we always
should be, as we always will be.

1285
01:27:30,932 --> 01:27:32,833
Mark!

1286
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:46,844
Good-bye, Laura.

1287
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:58,552
Good-bye, my love.
