1
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:01,592
What are you reading?

2
00:02:02,108 --> 00:02:05,270
- Nothing. I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

3
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:06,744
- Will that be all?
- Yes.

4
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:18,158
This machine drives me crazy.
I'll register it later.

5
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:23,824
- 1.25 plus 3.75...
- 5.

6
00:02:23,892 --> 00:02:28,080
Yes, five, of course.
Don't you have a smaller bill?

7
00:02:28,146 --> 00:02:30,992
- Not enough change.
- I'll make it.

8
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:43,333
What an idiot! I do have it.
The change from the taxi.

9
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:47,199
The taxi-driver's change.
I took it all from him.

10
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:51,974
10, 20, 30, 40, 50.
I'm sure you need the change.

11
00:02:52,904 --> 00:02:56,645
If you have a 100 bill, I'll give
you 50, and 50, 100, in change.

12
00:02:58,438 --> 00:02:59,616
Yes.

13
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:13,367
- Bye, thanks.
- Bye.

14
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:28,273
- Bye.
- Bye.

15
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:01,485
- Hi.
- Hi.

16
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:12,673
We'll put it over there.

17
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:18,017
- He did that to me.
- What?

18
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:22,593
You know, the change.
Be careful, Betina.

19
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:24,865
He's pulling a trick
to take money from you.

20
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:27,354
- What the fuck's going on?
- He pulled a trick on me!

21
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:32,641
- He took money from me!
- Son of a bitch! Call the police!

22
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:35,325
- That won't be necessary. Don't call.
- Who the hell are you?

23
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,948
You thought I'd forget, right?

24
00:04:41,023 --> 00:04:45,462
You think I'm a prick,
just like all the assholes you swindle?

25
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:46,961
Is that it? You fucking thief!

26
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:52,597
- Freeze, motherfucker! Don't resist.
- I won't resist.

27
00:04:56,538 --> 00:04:58,064
Stop it, goddamit, look... !

28
00:04:58,137 --> 00:05:00,111
Who the fuck do you think
you are talking to?

29
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:03,636
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

30
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:09,771
Is this the money you took from her?
Is this it?

31
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,526
You'll get a call from the precinct.

32
00:05:16,594 --> 00:05:19,310
To file your report
and to return this to you.

33
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,447
Don't move from here.

34
00:05:50,436 --> 00:05:52,410
Do you smoke?

35
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:55,740
- Smoke these?
- No.

36
00:05:56,227 --> 00:05:58,331
A pity. I no longer smoke.

37
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:09,555
Crunchy...

38
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:13,303
made in Greece.

39
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:17,107
This country is going to hell.

40
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,239
Do you want?

41
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:23,956
I'm such an asshole!

42
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,955
What an asshole!

43
00:06:44,977 --> 00:06:46,186
It's not that bad.

44
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,319
I should know when someone's
pulling a trick on me.

45
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:52,810
Depends on who's doing it.

46
00:06:54,252 --> 00:06:57,448
- It was the gun that convinced me.
- The gun?

47
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:01,663
The only thing handy.

48
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:08,196
Are you mad, kid?

49
00:07:11,174 --> 00:07:13,988
"He pulled a trick on me! "

50
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:22,653
Why did you help me out?

51
00:07:23,714 --> 00:07:26,680
It was a pity you'd get canned
for 45 lousy bucks.

52
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:31,673
- How d'you know it's 45?
- I did that trick a million times.

53
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:34,610
And I know you can't
do it twice at the same store.

54
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:37,619
You get in, you do it
and you get out... that's it.

55
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:40,377
Unless you want
to get beaten and canned...

56
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:42,581
not necessarily in that order.

57
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:45,586
- You are a swindler.
- A dentist.

58
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:50,606
- The professional felt pity for the asshole.
- Beginner.

59
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:55,690
I hope one day
I'm as good as you, teacher.

60
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:58,131
Thanks anyway. Goodbye.

61
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:00,778
Hold it!

62
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:05,997
What do you want?

63
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:09,352
That's a strange way
of saying thanks.

64
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:11,333
I said thanks.
What else do you want?

65
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,836
Not me, what do you want?

66
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:15,496
- What do I want?
- Survive, I guess.

67
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:21,800
- I can teach you a couple of tricks.
- Why?

68
00:08:22,188 --> 00:08:25,667
Because otherwise...
you're headed for trouble.

69
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:29,381
- Thanks a lot, but I'm doing fine.
- Yeah, I can see that.

70
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,612
I'm not the smartest
but I'm street-wise...

71
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,361
and I know that nobody gives
you anything for free...

72
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,859
especially someone like you.

73
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,842
- What d'you want?
- I already told you.

74
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:40,835
Try telling me the truth.

75
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:50,774
I work with another guy,
a partner, Turco.

76
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:56,568
He disappeared a week ago, completely.

77
00:08:59,677 --> 00:09:01,881
The thing is, I need a partner.

78
00:09:03,131 --> 00:09:05,171
I don't know how
to work on my own, I can't.

79
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:08,371
I saw you at the gas station
and I thought...

80
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:11,954
perhaps...

81
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:15,315
Why me?

82
00:09:16,631 --> 00:09:18,386
Why not?

83
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:25,963
No, look... I work alone,
and besides, I don't know you.

84
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:28,910
I'm Marcos... and you are... ?

85
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:32,297
Juan.

86
00:09:32,368 --> 00:09:34,441
Juan. But you've
always wanted to be called...

87
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:38,756
Sebastin.

88
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,480
Guys called Juan
always want another name.

89
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,859
Let's do business, Sebastin?

90
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:45,160
- Juan.
- Juan.

91
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,159
Just for today, one day only.
Then you can decide.

92
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:55,424
- No, thanks.
- It's up to you to do it.

93
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:58,310
If you want to keep on
playing in the little leagues.

94
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,086
Here, kid.
Don't lose your money.

95
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,961
Hey... Marcos...

96
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,215
Just for today.

97
00:10:19,008 --> 00:10:19,519
- Who is it?
- Auntie?

98
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,013
- Who is it?
- Auntie?

99
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,387
- No, who is it?
- I'm sorry.

100
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:25,362
- Who is it?
- Auntie?

101
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:26,713
- No. What auntie?
- Excuse me.

102
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:30,421
- Hello?
- Auntie?

103
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,103
- No, wrong floor.
- Excuse me.

104
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:36,687
- Who is it?
- Auntie?

105
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,253
Who is it?

106
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,635
Wait, wait...

107
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:50,378
Hang on.

108
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,606
- Do you have kids?
- No.

109
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,418
- And that?
- It's for me.

110
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:08,681
I had one like it when I was a kid.
A bit larger than this one.

111
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:10,852
It belonged to my father.

112
00:11:10,923 --> 00:11:13,289
When there was
a game on TV...

113
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:15,623
it was one of the few
days Dad stayed at home.

114
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,161
I'd set my wooden racetrack
and play with the car.

115
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:23,166
Mum would listen
to her favorite record by Rita Pavone.

116
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:26,082
- Rita Pavone?
- Yes.

117
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,465
A real fan. She wouldn't
acknowledge she was outdated.

118
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,018
When we were together
at home we listened...

119
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:36,887
to Rita Pavone. "II Ballo
del Mattone." Know the song?

120
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,239
- Who is it?
- Auntie?

121
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:40,443
- No, wrong floor.
- Excuse me.

122
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:43,422
It was very popular.
They used the song for a movie...

123
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,203
Mom told me.
It went...

124
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:54,610
- Who is it?
- I see.

125
00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:57,748
- Auntie?
- Yes. Who is it?

126
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,496
You can't recognize
your favorite nephew?

127
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:03,284
- Fabin, is that you?
- Yes, Auntie, it's Fabin.

128
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:06,384
It's been a long time, dear.
What a miracle!

129
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:10,708
You got a cold? I can't hear you well.
I hardly recognize you.

130
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:12,458
You came to visit me?

131
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:15,466
No, you'll be mad at me.
I'm with a friend...

132
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:20,589
We came to visit someone
near here and my car broke down.

133
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,867
The car?

134
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:23,943
- Yes.
- You bought a car?

135
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:26,731
You didn't know?
You gotta see it. You'll love it.

136
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,572
- Guess what color it is.
- What color? Don't tell me.

137
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,521
Turquoise.

138
00:12:32,588 --> 00:12:36,362
No, I wanted turquoise
but I got a blue one.

139
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:40,102
The thing is, they're about
to tow it to the garage...

140
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,485
...and after checking my wallet
I realized I got no money.

141
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,469
It was then I noticed
I was close to your place...

142
00:12:45,544 --> 00:12:49,089
How could you?
You have to check before going out.

143
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,132
Don't give me a hard time.

144
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:55,993
Could you lend me some money?
Say 50, 60 pesos.

145
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,935
I'll go to the garage,
get the cash and bring it back to you.

146
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,937
You needn't do it so fast.
But we could have a coffee.

147
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,107
I promise, auntie.
We'll have a coffee together.

148
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:08,825
Look, I don't want
to leave the car alone.

149
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:11,130
My friend's staying here,
give him the money.

150
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:13,052
Don't worry.

151
00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:15,320
I'm coming down.
Your friend can be trusted?

152
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:33,876
She gave me a hundred.

153
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:38,354
- Nice old lady.
- She sends her love to your mother.

154
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:42,505
I'd have to go to the cemetery,
too much trouble.

155
00:13:42,577 --> 00:13:44,943
And she gave me this
to give back to her.

156
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:50,958
- Why didn't you keep it?
- I'm not a crook.

157
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:53,928
- What is it?
- Nothing.

158
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,745
- You want the ring?
- No, it's not that.

159
00:13:56,813 --> 00:13:59,016
- What is it?
- The old lady...

160
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:02,403
Let me get this straight:
gas station clerks, it's okay...

161
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,776
trusting old ladies, never.

162
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:07,878
It's not that. She told me
I looked like her grandson.

163
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:11,969
Give her back the money
and set up a grocery store.

164
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,893
What's wrong with you?

165
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,706
How can you work the streets
with such a conscience?

166
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:20,666
- That's my problem.
- No, that's our problem. For today.

167
00:14:27,457 --> 00:14:30,304
Hang on. Since we are here...

168
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:37,946
Go in, order a coffee...

169
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:43,097
pay with this, and get out.

170
00:14:43,163 --> 00:14:44,886
You don't know me.

171
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:28,038
I need money.

172
00:15:28,618 --> 00:15:30,526
That's original.

173
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:32,706
No, I need money, now...

174
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:36,484
Lots of it.
That's why I'm on the streets.

175
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:38,558
You feel ambitious today?

176
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,177
No, it's my father.
I'm gathering money for him.

177
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:44,316
- How much?
- A lot.

178
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:46,176
Come on, how much?

179
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:49,630
Seventy grand.

180
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,640
Holy shit!
What is it with your father?

181
00:15:53,473 --> 00:15:56,635
- He's in trouble.
- And you solve your dad's problems?

182
00:15:58,431 --> 00:16:03,285
Yes, we get along fine.
He taught me the tricks for working.

183
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:05,298
When I was a kid, as a game.

184
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:08,720
- "Mosqueta", "Toco Mocho"...
- The basics...

185
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:12,978
Then something happened,
I don't know what.

186
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:16,529
He regretted having taught me.
He said it was wrong.

187
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:21,685
He told me not to screw up
my life like he had screwed his.

188
00:16:22,134 --> 00:16:25,198
He told me to do
something else. Anything.

189
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:28,239
I did as he said.
I did something.

190
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:31,241
- And it didn't work.
- Everything I did was a failure.

191
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:36,492
What did you say when asked
what you wanted to be?

192
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:39,428
- Left wing.
- I wanted to be an accomplice.

193
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,779
I heard it a lot at home...

194
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:48,039
and what can you do
for a living with such a vocation?

195
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,089
Minister?

196
00:16:49,163 --> 00:16:53,024
Now that my Dad needs
the money the only way...

197
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:56,128
to get it is to use
the tricks he taught me.

198
00:16:56,744 --> 00:17:00,572
I try hard to remember each phrase,
and each flick of the hands.

199
00:17:00,647 --> 00:17:02,686
I sold my apartment to start...

200
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:05,885
an import business that
didn't even get off the ground.

201
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:10,690
Well, the 7 0 grand is still there,
like the carrot...

202
00:17:10,756 --> 00:17:14,170
I'm an asshole, the 50 grand
I scraped are good for nothing.

203
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:23,353
You were saying?

204
00:17:30,492 --> 00:17:33,425
- My change, please. I've got to go.
- What change, Sir?

205
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:35,886
The change for the $1 00
I gave you ten minutes ago.

206
00:17:35,962 --> 00:17:39,375
- No, you gave me nothing.
- Come on, I'm in a hurry.

207
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:43,474
- You didn't pay me.
- Are you serving too many tables?

208
00:17:43,702 --> 00:17:45,076
Shall I help you? Manager!

209
00:17:45,142 --> 00:17:49,331
- You didn't pay. Don't shout.
- Don't tell me what to do.

210
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:50,324
- Manager!
- What is it?

211
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:52,297
This gentleman says
he paid me but it's not true.

212
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:55,469
- Are you calling me a liar?
- No, sir. There must be a confusion.

213
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:58,255
No. I had a coffee and paid
with a $1 00 bill.

214
00:17:58,322 --> 00:18:00,263
I had two,
now I've got one.

215
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:02,408
Check.
Maybe you got confused.

216
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,894
Don't insist with the confusion bit.
There's no confusion. Look.

217
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:10,024
I had two bills, now I have one.
Look, that's it.

218
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:12,971
The tip is cut off.
The bill I paid with is missing the tip.

219
00:18:13,036 --> 00:18:16,069
Check in your register box
if there's a bill with a missing tip.

220
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:17,926
Cut it, I'm in a hurry.

221
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:19,554
- Come.
- I'm not going anywhere.

222
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:23,780
Go get my change.
I'm not going anywhere. Are you nuts?

223
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,077
What is it?

224
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:32,226
Your cut. Like it?

225
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:34,240
- I knew this trick.
- You do it?

226
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:35,681
- No.
- Why?

227
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,753
Too many people around.
You have to make a scandal.

228
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:41,207
- It's not my style.
- But that's the point, pal.

229
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:44,830
They are not prepared to get
into a scandal. What's the key?

230
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:47,066
The more offended you are,
the less suspicious you look.

231
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:49,621
If things get tough,
you accuse the rest of them.

232
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:50,970
Not my style.

233
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:53,884
- What part?
- The exposure, I don't like it.

234
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:56,248
The risk of something going wrong.

235
00:18:56,316 --> 00:18:59,249
- Lf the going gets rough, I can't do it.
- You chose the wrong job.

236
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:01,779
I didn't choose.

237
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:12,308
D'you have some small change?
I have to make a call.

238
00:19:17,203 --> 00:19:19,723
It's private... you know...

239
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:31,016
Arrange it. Bye.

240
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:37,163
Who were you talking to?

241
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:42,597
With my lawyer.
I still have some outstanding business.

242
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:52,669
- Who was it?
- A friend.

243
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:56,832
Okay, what's next?

244
00:19:57,508 --> 00:19:59,263
I don't know.

245
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:04,153
In fact I've been thinking...
I don't know if it's worth it.

246
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:08,856
All this... perhaps it's best
that you go on with your stuff.

247
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:12,795
Turco must be coming
back soon and...

248
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:15,381
if he finds out I've replaced him,
he'll get mad.

249
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,393
Turco is a bit jealous.

250
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:20,887
No, wait, what is it?

251
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:27,056
Nothing... this is not for you.
You're not into it.

252
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:30,319
- You could fuck up, and if that happens...
- What could I fuck up?

253
00:20:30,392 --> 00:20:32,944
What kind of an idiot d'you think I am?

254
00:20:33,015 --> 00:20:35,501
- The kind who thinks too much.
- Is that a liability?

255
00:20:35,573 --> 00:20:36,980
- It's a liability.
- Why?

256
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:40,589
If you think too much,
you won't do some things.

257
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:44,455
Look, I need the money.

258
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:48,206
Splitting 50% with you, I'll make more
than 1 00% if I were on my own.

259
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:50,760
This is not about learning
a couple of tricks.

260
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:54,605
Any asshole knows it.
You need something else for this job.

261
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:56,260
Talent...

262
00:20:57,197 --> 00:20:58,626
and you've got it.

263
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:01,292
Otherwise, I wouldn't be alive.

264
00:21:01,356 --> 00:21:04,453
Are you that good?
Can you achieve anything you set out for?

265
00:21:04,523 --> 00:21:05,863
Anything.

266
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:13,570
Can you get that purse
in less than two minutes?

267
00:21:14,311 --> 00:21:17,343
- She has to voluntarily hand me her purse?
- In two minutes.

268
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:19,715
No, not that.

269
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,976
- I can.
- No, you can't.

270
00:21:23,044 --> 00:21:24,832
I bet you the ring.

271
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:44,114
- Hi.
- Hi.

272
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:52,343
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

273
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:56,428
- What floor, madam?
- Fourth.

274
00:21:56,502 --> 00:21:58,891
- And you?
- The penthouse.

275
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:15,916
- What is it?
- I don't know.

276
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,868
These old elevators,
they break down, they fall down.

277
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,516
- Please, don't say that.
- It happens all the time.

278
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,363
Holy shit!

279
00:22:40,582 --> 00:22:43,515
- Let's get help.
- Makes sense.

280
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,035
No, we'll do something else.

281
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:52,537
- We're going out and we'll use the stairs.
- That way?

282
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:56,444
Let me help you.

283
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:01,719
Your purse,
I'll place it here.

284
00:23:02,718 --> 00:23:04,921
Shall I hold it for you?

285
00:23:12,282 --> 00:23:15,893
- I didn't know that one.
- Neither did I.

286
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:18,677
- You improvised?
- Yes.

287
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,286
- Really?
- Yes.

288
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,332
That was fast.

289
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:31,794
And you have another asset
that'll make your life easier.

290
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:35,534
Something money can't buy.
You look like a nice guy.

291
00:23:35,602 --> 00:23:40,269
Incredible! Once again you've
sent me the wrong paper!

292
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,244
I'm sick and tired of
coming myself to get it!

293
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,449
- What's your address?
- Viamonte 1 2 42, 2nd. "B".

294
00:23:53,995 --> 00:23:56,961
- You're so cheap. Can't you buy it?
- Don't call me cheap.

295
00:23:57,801 --> 00:24:00,070
Are you upset?

296
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,200
Of course I can buy it,
but I can also not buy it.

297
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,539
As everybody else would do if they could.

298
00:24:05,606 --> 00:24:09,249
- D'you think everybody is like you?
- Like me? Most.

299
00:24:09,318 --> 00:24:13,090
- The thing is they don't have enough balls.
- At least it's most.

300
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:15,675
Then there's the decent folk,
and then there's you...

301
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:18,266
and you would be... what?

302
00:24:18,338 --> 00:24:19,995
What's up, man?

303
00:24:21,281 --> 00:24:23,800
You wouldn't have gotten her out
of the elevator, would you?

304
00:24:24,574 --> 00:24:26,581
- What are you talking about?
- The purse.

305
00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:29,914
- You would have walked away with it.
- What do you mean?

306
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,649
You think I'm a thief?

307
00:24:34,268 --> 00:24:37,878
I don't kill people.
I don't use a piece. Anyone can do that.

308
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:40,531
Do you want to see thieves?
Come.

309
00:24:41,752 --> 00:24:43,029
Those two are...

310
00:24:43,096 --> 00:24:46,259
waiting for someone
with a briefcase on the street side.

311
00:24:47,894 --> 00:24:51,668
That one,
sizing up loaded victims.

312
00:24:52,276 --> 00:24:54,643
They are there,
but you can't see them.

313
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:57,576
That's what it's all about.
They're there, but they aren't.

314
00:24:57,651 --> 00:25:00,966
So mind your briefcase,
your case, your door...

315
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:05,480
your window, your car,
your savings.

316
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:09,227
Mind your ass. Because they're
there and they'll always be.

317
00:25:09,294 --> 00:25:13,254
- Thieves.
- No... that's what everybody calls them.

318
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:18,559
They are spitters, breakers,
skin workers, blind fronts...

319
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:24,262
hoisters, hooks, stalls, petermans,
night raiders, spitters...

320
00:25:24,328 --> 00:25:31,134
mustard chuckers, fences,
operators, swindlers...

321
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:36,926
I'm hungry.
Let's go to my office to get a meal.

322
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,098
What is it?

323
00:26:02,713 --> 00:26:05,014
Sit there, wait for me.

324
00:26:05,144 --> 00:26:08,788
- Anibal, could you clear my desk?
- Your sister called.

325
00:26:09,463 --> 00:26:11,121
How d'you know it was my sister?

326
00:26:11,192 --> 00:26:13,329
She said she was
your sister, Valeria.

327
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:15,023
I didn't know you had a sister.

328
00:26:15,092 --> 00:26:17,939
- Yes, I got a sister.
- What time did she call?

329
00:26:18,004 --> 00:26:21,483
- About an hour ago.
- Did she say what she wanted?

330
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:24,422
Get an office with a secretary
and stop busting my balls.

331
00:26:24,497 --> 00:26:26,570
Get me something to eat,
something tasty.

332
00:26:30,543 --> 00:26:33,193
If you don't mind,
I'll choose the meal next time.

333
00:26:33,263 --> 00:26:35,302
You're a pain in the ass, kid.

334
00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:37,738
- When?
- This morning.

335
00:26:37,836 --> 00:26:41,131
- What did you say?
- That you were hospitalized.

336
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,885
- Why were you hospitalized?
- No...

337
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:51,676
I think I'm running out of credit.

338
00:26:54,502 --> 00:26:57,884
I'm a mess with money.
It's hard for me to...

339
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,455
- A mess?
- Your sister.

340
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:05,402
Hello.

341
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:10,461
Either we never get to talk
or we speak twice the same day.

342
00:27:11,807 --> 00:27:14,327
No, I can't now.

343
00:27:15,486 --> 00:27:17,525
And why should it concern me?

344
00:27:17,758 --> 00:27:19,797
If you're fucking with me
to get me to go and talk about...

345
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:21,810
our grandparents' estate

346
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,953
Wait. Wait a minute!

347
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:29,718
Alright, I'm on my way.
Yes!

348
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:36,363
- Problems?
- I don't know. Maybe.

349
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:39,569
I'm going to see my sister.

350
00:27:39,637 --> 00:27:41,261
And what shall I do?

351
00:27:43,156 --> 00:27:45,359
Come along.
You never know with my sister.

352
00:27:45,427 --> 00:27:48,394
Maybe I might need a witness.
Pay for this. I'll pay you later.

353
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,541
- Your sister works here?
- Yes.

354
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:01,803
- Does she... ?
- No.

355
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:04,675
My sister is a responsible person.

356
00:28:57,752 --> 00:29:02,419
- A miracle. I called and you came.
- I'm fine, thanks. And you?

357
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:05,354
Fine, we are fine.
Thanks for your concern.

358
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:06,922
You called to give me shit?

359
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:09,167
I'm trying to keep the party going,
to be polite.

360
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:11,601
I wish it was a party.
You needn't be polite.

361
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,513
It'd be enough if you just
carried out your responsibilities.

362
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:16,552
I heard that song before.
I think it was your mother singing it.

363
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:19,819
- You're a bastard!
- Watch your mouth.

364
00:29:19,887 --> 00:29:23,432
Be careful your bosses might listen.
How many are they? Ten, twenty?

365
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:26,632
Never seen a woman
with as many bosses as she has.

366
00:29:27,244 --> 00:29:29,317
- Who is this?
- Juan, a friend.

367
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:32,486
- I called you.
- And I came with him. What d'you want?

368
00:29:32,778 --> 00:29:34,021
Come here.

369
00:29:38,313 --> 00:29:40,930
How many times did I ask you
not to meddle with the hotel...

370
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,908
and its guests, that you do
your business elsewhere?

371
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:43,930
Too many.

372
00:29:44,006 --> 00:29:46,143
I was at the lobby and
that partner of yours, the old man...

373
00:29:46,213 --> 00:29:47,325
what was his name?

374
00:29:47,397 --> 00:29:49,119
- Sandler?
- That's it.

375
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:51,096
- I thought he had died.
- Don't fuck with me.

376
00:29:51,172 --> 00:29:53,080
I'm not. I haven't seen him
in six or seven years.

377
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:55,576
Besides, he wasn't my partner.
He does something else.

378
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,390
He was at the lobby insisting
on seeing a guest.

379
00:29:59,456 --> 00:30:01,561
I thought it was one of your affairs.

380
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:02,743
You're wrong.

381
00:30:02,815 --> 00:30:06,556
I had you called, they didn't find you,
and I had him sent out.

382
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:08,214
You've become a snitch?

383
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:13,498
This is my job and I work my ass off
1 2 hours a day to keep it.

384
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,693
I hope you don't
mean it literally.

385
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:23,758
When the old man was being
thrown out, he had a seizure...

386
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:25,391
He fainted.

387
00:30:25,462 --> 00:30:27,317
The house doctor
has already seen him...

388
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:30,062
and they'll call an ambulance shortly.

389
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:32,042
What does all this have
to do with me?

390
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:36,238
The old man recognized me and
asked me, begged me to call you...

391
00:30:36,306 --> 00:30:38,727
that it was urgent,
he needed to talk to you.

392
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,841
My life is quite a mess as it is.

393
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:48,109
Make sure he doesn't come back.
Neither do you.

394
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:50,345
- You called me.
- He did.

395
00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:52,491
Whatever you have to settle,
do it and go away.

396
00:30:52,557 --> 00:30:54,312
It makes me nervous
to see you here.

397
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,964
You're as loving as always.

398
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,544
By the way, are you dating someone,
did you get married?

399
00:31:02,313 --> 00:31:04,864
I'm dating.
It will be one year tomorrow.

400
00:31:05,575 --> 00:31:09,851
- Congratulations. I know him?
- I don't think so. He's decent.

401
00:31:15,364 --> 00:31:17,468
Nice ass, right?

402
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:27,987
Marquitos, you came.

403
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:32,700
- You called me, Sandler.
- I thought... you know...

404
00:31:34,044 --> 00:31:35,418
And him?

405
00:31:35,484 --> 00:31:38,385
He's with me. If you want to
I can ask him to leave.

406
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,343
Juan?

407
00:31:53,461 --> 00:31:56,014
Aren't you Juan, Ramiro's kid?

408
00:31:58,195 --> 00:32:00,104
I worked with
your father many years ago.

409
00:32:01,107 --> 00:32:05,644
I would forge the papers for him,
and he pushed them.

410
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:10,058
- Sandler is an artist.
- Yes, an artist.

411
00:32:11,855 --> 00:32:14,407
- I made you make big money.
- Those were other times.

412
00:32:16,172 --> 00:32:19,138
- You don't remember me?
- No.

413
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,457
You were a little kid then.

414
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:27,495
Perhaps ten, twelve.

415
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:33,371
- Good memory.
- He was a smart kid.

416
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:38,427
This is all very touching
but why did you have me called?

417
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,303
Hand me the briefcase.

418
00:32:48,864 --> 00:32:55,898
Esteban Vidal Gandolfo is
a guest at this hotel.

419
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:57,717
Do you know him?

420
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:04,953
DEPORTATION
OF VI DAL GANDOLFO

421
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,856
"Owns a holding."

422
00:33:10,424 --> 00:33:12,911
"Must leave the country in a hurry."

423
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:16,714
"Parliamentary investigation.
Deportation to Venezuela."

424
00:33:19,156 --> 00:33:21,327
Five hundred million dollars?

425
00:33:23,732 --> 00:33:25,934
Whatever it is, it's too big for you.

426
00:33:26,002 --> 00:33:28,653
He's got a hobby.
He's worth 500 million...

427
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:31,247
and he's got a hobby.

428
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:34,316
- Which one?
- Stamps.

429
00:33:41,964 --> 00:33:45,345
- Didn't you have a... ?
- Brother-in-law. A stamp collector.

430
00:33:45,418 --> 00:33:48,733
A very good one.
The husband of my sister, Berta.

431
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:51,743
- The one who lives at the Kavanagh.
- My rich sister.

432
00:33:51,816 --> 00:33:55,907
He died eight, nine years ago,
and left her the whole collection...

433
00:33:55,975 --> 00:33:58,429
including the "Nine Queens".

434
00:33:58,502 --> 00:33:59,581
Nine Queens?

435
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:04,313
The Nine Queens is a sheet
of stamps from the Weimar Republic.

436
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:09,503
- Defective, rare and very valuable.
- How much?

437
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:12,921
I don't know.
I didn't have time to establish a price.

438
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:16,285
You wanted to sell them
to Vidal Gandolfo?

439
00:34:16,351 --> 00:34:20,725
My sister's stamps? No, not hers.

440
00:34:20,798 --> 00:34:23,033
She wouldn't sell them.

441
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:27,125
She says they remind her
of her husband. No.

442
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,875
So?

443
00:34:30,425 --> 00:34:32,945
But I got to see them.

444
00:34:33,336 --> 00:34:36,433
I studied them.
I took photographs.

445
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:40,851
- You copied them.
- My best work ever.

446
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:46,383
Original paper.
1 920.

447
00:34:47,187 --> 00:34:49,836
Hand-cut.
One perforation at a time.

448
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:54,214
This is one of your photos?

449
00:34:55,824 --> 00:34:58,124
The trick is the time.

450
00:34:58,575 --> 00:35:00,746
I know they wouldn't pass a lab test.

451
00:35:02,381 --> 00:35:06,176
But they're taking the guy
to the airport tomorrow.

452
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,733
He doesn't have the time
to check them thoroughly.

453
00:35:10,283 --> 00:35:12,224
That's why they must be sold today.

454
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:18,337
He'll go for it.
He must believe it's now or never.

455
00:35:21,798 --> 00:35:24,219
Please, take me to the toilet.

456
00:35:30,691 --> 00:35:32,217
Easy.

457
00:35:40,032 --> 00:35:44,056
- Do you know this Spaniard?
- I read something about him.

458
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:45,814
Then he exists.

459
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:49,364
Yes, of course he exists.

460
00:35:52,571 --> 00:35:54,872
Let me get this straight.

461
00:35:54,938 --> 00:35:57,555
You came to the hotel
asking for the Spaniard.

462
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,796
When you couldn't get through,
you got nervous...

463
00:35:59,864 --> 00:36:03,058
because you thought you'd blown it.
Is that so?

464
00:36:03,574 --> 00:36:05,810
It was then that you blew your fuse.

465
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:16,618
So you need someone
to sell the goods for you...

466
00:36:16,881 --> 00:36:17,829
today.

467
00:36:19,376 --> 00:36:20,805
Why me, of all people?

468
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,842
When I fell ill I saw
your sister and I thought...

469
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:29,159
Why not?
It's been a long time.

470
00:36:31,404 --> 00:36:35,712
You didn't expect this, did you?
Here I am, trusting you again.

471
00:36:35,786 --> 00:36:40,257
You're desperate.
You had no one else to call.

472
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,130
I can give you 20%.

473
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:46,082
No.

474
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,272
No, look...

475
00:36:51,172 --> 00:36:53,953
Let me tell you what the situation is...

476
00:36:54,115 --> 00:36:57,278
You don't set the percentages, I do.

477
00:36:57,346 --> 00:36:59,516
Because if I leave now...

478
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:02,846
all you'll get will be
an enema at a public hospital.

479
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:05,973
Listen, I'm 73.

480
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:08,405
I don't have many opportunities left...

481
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:11,128
and this one is mine, rightfully.

482
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:15,062
Don't fuck with me, Marcos.
I can call someone else.

483
00:37:15,131 --> 00:37:18,545
If you could call someone else,
you'd have already done so.

484
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:20,879
How much do you want?

485
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:24,082
90%.

486
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:27,061
You are crazy.

487
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:31,053
No, the thing is I got you by the balls.

488
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:35,146
- Let's do it 50-50.
- I'm not negotiating.

489
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,542
I'm making you
the only offer you'll ever get.

490
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:41,006
1 0% for you...

491
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,078
or nothing, zip.

492
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:45,573
I didn't come to you, Sandler.

493
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:49,091
It was the other way round.

494
00:37:49,774 --> 00:37:52,555
I never learn.

495
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:55,590
- I'm an asshole.
- You're not an asshole. You are fucked up.

496
00:37:59,595 --> 00:38:01,220
Well?

497
00:38:30,335 --> 00:38:33,116
The wife has the stamps at their place.

498
00:38:33,182 --> 00:38:35,353
If I tell her he sends me,
she'll give them to me.

499
00:38:35,421 --> 00:38:38,136
He asked me not to mention the hospital.
He doesn't want to scare her.

500
00:38:38,203 --> 00:38:40,112
D'you know anything
about stamps?

501
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:42,423
They're small square papers
you stick on envelopes.

502
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,944
- You'll go ahead with it?
- Sure!

503
00:38:45,017 --> 00:38:46,609
- What?
- Nothing.

504
00:38:46,681 --> 00:38:48,720
- I find it a bit strange.
- Which part?

505
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:52,086
- All of it.
- Strange? You find it strange?

506
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:55,156
Kid, I've sold barbed wire seeds
and got thanked for it.

507
00:38:55,221 --> 00:38:58,068
D'you think I can get scared
with some stamps?

508
00:38:58,133 --> 00:39:03,216
What can I lose? I risk nothing.
If I sell, I keep everything.

509
00:39:03,283 --> 00:39:05,649
And if the cops get involved?

510
00:39:06,705 --> 00:39:08,493
No, kid.
This is something else.

511
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,907
This is something you can wait for your
entire life and could never happen.

512
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:14,121
One in a million.

513
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,012
The old man is a good artist.

514
00:39:16,077 --> 00:39:20,418
He's the best.
And I can sell those stamps.

515
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:25,347
- I can probably get... thirty grand.
- Thirty grand?

516
00:39:26,346 --> 00:39:29,126
- More, you think?
- Come.

517
00:39:32,551 --> 00:39:35,899
What is it?
What do you want?

518
00:39:36,038 --> 00:39:38,426
- I want in.
- In where?

519
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,533
The deal. I need the cash.
I want a part.

520
00:39:41,603 --> 00:39:43,676
A part? Are you crazy?

521
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,080
I don't mean much.
Just a percentage.

522
00:39:46,146 --> 00:39:47,640
We're together for the day.

523
00:39:47,714 --> 00:39:50,168
Why should I give you a percentage?

524
00:39:50,241 --> 00:39:53,720
This reached me through my sister.

525
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,180
- Who the fuck d'you think you are?
- Well, I was there.

526
00:39:56,254 --> 00:39:58,774
Fuck that! You don't even
know Sandler's address.

527
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,376
I'll need help. Stay with me
for a lump sum... a grand.

528
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:07,028
- Three.
- One and a half.

529
00:40:07,098 --> 00:40:09,464
- Two and a half.
- Okay, two.

530
00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:11,699
- Two and a half.
- Alright!

531
00:40:12,248 --> 00:40:14,386
Only if we pull it off.

532
00:40:55,017 --> 00:40:57,471
- What was the name of the guy?
- None of your business.

533
00:40:57,544 --> 00:41:00,193
- Vidal Garafalo?
- Gandolfo.

534
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:02,299
Gandolfo. He likes you.

535
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:05,220
I'd like to talk to you about...
Why do you ask?

536
00:41:05,284 --> 00:41:06,843
It's nothing.

537
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:09,729
- Don't mess with that guy...
- I'll be back.

538
00:41:22,973 --> 00:41:26,834
D'you remember a song by R. Pavone,
II Ballo del Mattone?

539
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,664
That's it, let's go.
We won't bother you again.

540
00:41:39,735 --> 00:41:42,319
What about
our grandparent's estate?

541
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,277
Not again.
Talk to your lawyer.

542
00:41:44,341 --> 00:41:46,512
Don't fuck with me,
your lawyer's delaying it.

543
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:49,427
- That's what lawyers are for.
- Do it for Federico.

544
00:41:49,492 --> 00:41:51,946
- What does he have to do?
- You're screwing him too.

545
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:54,384
- The third part is his.
- I'm not screwing anybody.

546
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:58,027
You wanted to sue me? You did.
D'you want my blood now?

547
00:41:58,097 --> 00:42:00,038
Look at the victim.
You're a bastard!

548
00:42:00,112 --> 00:42:03,241
Don't insult me.
And leave the boy out of this.

549
00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:05,611
He is not staying out.
You explain it to him.

550
00:42:06,893 --> 00:42:08,452
- How are you?
- What's up, boy?

551
00:42:08,524 --> 00:42:09,953
- Fine?
- How are you?

552
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,394
Didn't you say he never came,
he didn't care? How are you?

553
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:14,978
- Fine. And you?
- Okay.

554
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:18,976
Finally your sister got to have you
working with her all dressed up.

555
00:42:19,048 --> 00:42:22,343
Yes, we need the money.
We still have debts.

556
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:25,122
You don't have to explain.
You shouldn't feel ashamed.

557
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,742
Explain to him why he can't
collect his grandparents' money.

558
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:30,015
- Valeria, cut it out.
- Yes.

559
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:33,661
- Don't be naive, Federico.
- Don't involve me in this mess.

560
00:42:34,114 --> 00:42:36,022
He's already explained what
happened with the inheritance.

561
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:38,715
- You believe him?
- Of course, he's my brother.

562
00:42:38,785 --> 00:42:40,726
Do what you have to do,
sue him. I don't care.

563
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,424
But don't bust my balls.

564
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,060
- I have to go back to work. See you.
- Okay.

565
00:42:52,476 --> 00:42:53,816
Bye.

566
00:43:06,775 --> 00:43:08,715
- Good afternoon.
- What d'you want?

567
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:12,648
Your husband sent us to pick
up an envelope he left for us.

568
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:15,112
It's a yellow,
large envelope on the shelf...

569
00:43:15,187 --> 00:43:17,869
in the living room
under the Chinese jar.

570
00:43:17,938 --> 00:43:19,847
- My husband is not in.
- Yes, I know.

571
00:43:19,922 --> 00:43:21,645
He said that
even if he wasn't home...

572
00:43:21,713 --> 00:43:23,402
we could come by
to pick up the envelope.

573
00:43:23,471 --> 00:43:26,819
He's not in!
Come back later.

574
00:43:26,894 --> 00:43:29,031
We'd love to, but we can't.

575
00:43:29,102 --> 00:43:32,516
- Sandler, Mr. Sandler said that...
- He's not in!

576
00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:36,864
He's not in!
My husband is not in!

577
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,548
Who are you?
What do you want from me?

578
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:45,187
- Nothing, it's just...
- Go away or I'll call the police.

579
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:48,069
- Madam, please...
- Go away!

580
00:43:48,135 --> 00:43:53,468
I know your kind. You take
advantage of old ladies like me.

581
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:54,969
But I won't allow it.

582
00:43:55,044 --> 00:43:57,793
That's why I don't open
my door to anyone.

583
00:43:57,859 --> 00:43:59,768
Let's go, the lady's right.
There's no point.

584
00:43:59,842 --> 00:44:01,784
Your mother will understand.
It's not that bad.

585
00:44:01,857 --> 00:44:04,246
If we ever visit her again,
we'll take her the photos...

586
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,327
otherwise we won't.

587
00:44:06,399 --> 00:44:10,587
Bye.
Forgive us, madam.

588
00:44:10,653 --> 00:44:13,687
My brother gets all worked up
when he's going to visit mother.

589
00:44:13,757 --> 00:44:16,124
And she was looking forward
to seeing these photos...

590
00:44:16,476 --> 00:44:18,068
but never mind.

591
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,026
We'll fix it somehow.
Goodbye.

592
00:44:25,368 --> 00:44:27,124
Listen...

593
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:32,781
No, not you. You stay there.
Come here.

594
00:44:37,748 --> 00:44:38,544
Yes?

595
00:44:38,612 --> 00:44:41,644
In that envelope there
are photos for your Mum?

596
00:44:41,714 --> 00:44:44,298
Some old photos of my Uncle Liver
and his family in Poland.

597
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:48,203
Your husband promised us
some copies of the originals.

598
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:51,402
We wanted to give them to
Mum now that we'll visit her.

599
00:44:51,726 --> 00:44:54,279
- Where does your mother live?
- In Entre Ros.

600
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,666
Entre Ros!

601
00:44:57,741 --> 00:45:01,765
Entre Ros.
Would you wait a minute?

602
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,614
- Okay, twenty percent.
- 50-50.

603
00:45:07,689 --> 00:45:09,444
No fucking way, I'd kill you first.
Twenty-five percent.

604
00:45:09,512 --> 00:45:10,940
You can't do it without me.

605
00:45:11,015 --> 00:45:13,883
I'm not Sandler and
you really need the dough.

606
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:16,957
Thirty percent.
That's it, minus expenses.

607
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:25,887
Do you know Entre Ros?
Mom would never leave there.

608
00:45:25,953 --> 00:45:27,294
She always says...

609
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,077
"A Meckler stays in the land
where he was born."

610
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,353
Meckler?

611
00:45:31,424 --> 00:45:34,390
Is she related to Rabbi Meckler,
of Basavilbaso?

612
00:45:34,463 --> 00:45:37,243
Her cousin.
I'm his nephew.

613
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:47,831
Vidal Gandolfo will be at the hotel
the whole afternoon.

614
00:45:49,401 --> 00:45:53,360
- They ordered drinks for 3:30p.m.
- How will you approach him?

615
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:57,746
I don't know.

616
00:45:59,028 --> 00:46:01,417
- We must think of something.
- Think fast.

617
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,761
He's leaving tomorrow.
You don't have much time.

618
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:07,567
We, I mean, you could
contribute 30% of an idea.

619
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:10,382
How are you, dear Marcos?

620
00:46:10,512 --> 00:46:13,807
I'm sorry, Washington.
We're busy.

621
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:17,001
It'll take you longer to dismiss
me than to check my goods.

622
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:21,099
You're right.
What do you have?

623
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,973
Whatever you want.

624
00:46:25,643 --> 00:46:28,259
National, Buenos Aires,
Crdoba, Cooperative...

625
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:29,922
- Third parties?
- And blank checks.

626
00:46:29,993 --> 00:46:31,880
I have some
complete check books.

627
00:46:32,808 --> 00:46:36,549
- I want for you to leave.
- Don't you wanna make a gift?

628
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:38,338
You could impress your loved ones.

629
00:46:38,407 --> 00:46:42,179
Nothing better than
a Paraguayan Rolex to do that.

630
00:46:42,244 --> 00:46:45,789
And you, young man?
Anything else?

631
00:46:45,923 --> 00:46:48,857
Perfumes, clothing, imported sneakers?

632
00:46:49,282 --> 00:46:53,404
Computer software, paintings,
electronic devices?

633
00:46:54,176 --> 00:46:57,208
I have an excellentJapanese
bike, with minor damages.

634
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,904
- What damages?
- A hole in the tank.

635
00:46:58,974 --> 00:47:01,940
- A perforation?
- Small caliber.

636
00:47:02,012 --> 00:47:04,346
That's it, I need a gun
but something large.

637
00:47:04,412 --> 00:47:05,841
D'you have a .3 57?

638
00:47:06,651 --> 00:47:08,211
Marcos...

639
00:47:08,315 --> 00:47:10,584
I'm not a crook.

640
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:14,193
Have a nice day.

641
00:47:16,184 --> 00:47:19,053
Excuse me,
do you have cell phones?

642
00:47:19,607 --> 00:47:20,981
Any make in particular?

643
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:24,499
An idea?

644
00:47:36,976 --> 00:47:39,495
Easy, he'll go.

645
00:48:26,973 --> 00:48:28,248
Hello...

646
00:48:28,828 --> 00:48:31,096
Yes, it's me.

647
00:48:31,163 --> 00:48:35,569
What's up? It's not a good time.
I'm about to take a leak.

648
00:48:36,185 --> 00:48:38,324
At the hotel.

649
00:48:38,521 --> 00:48:40,592
I came because
I was given a tip...

650
00:48:40,664 --> 00:48:42,867
but I doubt it'll work out.

651
00:48:44,182 --> 00:48:47,280
No, no, I'm going
to Montevideo on Saturday.

652
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:51,091
I'll try to sell them there. Yes.

653
00:48:52,978 --> 00:48:56,752
The thing is not when but how much.

654
00:48:58,705 --> 00:49:02,413
Are you crazy?
For the "Nine Queens"?

655
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:06,093
I tell you what.

656
00:49:06,158 --> 00:49:08,579
For that amount go
to the post office and...

657
00:49:08,653 --> 00:49:10,343
get as many stamps as you like.

658
00:49:10,413 --> 00:49:12,353
Not even close.
Forget it.

659
00:49:17,002 --> 00:49:19,457
Now, that's better.

660
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:25,124
- What the fuck are you doing here?!
- Talking on the phone.

661
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:27,839
Don't fuck with me!

662
00:49:28,645 --> 00:49:30,619
It's the second time today
I see you around.

663
00:49:30,694 --> 00:49:32,154
You and that prick.

664
00:49:32,228 --> 00:49:33,690
What d'you want?

665
00:49:33,764 --> 00:49:36,381
I do the asking, you just answer.
What're you doing here?

666
00:49:36,451 --> 00:49:39,200
- What's the trick this time?
- I have something to sell.

667
00:49:39,266 --> 00:49:42,079
- It's legal, no strings attached.
- In the hotel restroom?

668
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,729
Don't fuck with me!
D'you want me to get really mad?

669
00:49:45,887 --> 00:49:50,293
We're all here now.
Look at the face of this guy.

670
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:52,372
Where did you find him?

671
00:49:52,668 --> 00:49:55,002
The people at the hotel
are worried.

672
00:49:55,068 --> 00:49:57,009
Come and explain everything to me.

673
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:58,805
That won't be necessary.

674
00:49:58,874 --> 00:50:02,102
I'm sure you won't mind
showing me your I D.

675
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,333
- Put the gun down.
- And who are you?

676
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:10,634
A guest at the hotel.

677
00:50:10,709 --> 00:50:12,596
These gentlemen
are here because...

678
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:14,319
- I called them.
- You called them?

679
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:18,861
Please, put the gun away.

680
00:50:18,931 --> 00:50:23,599
You might be a guest here,
the king of Spain, but I don't

681
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,204
You come with me.
And you, wait for me.

682
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:40,518
- You bastard!
- You liked it! You liked it!

683
00:50:40,587 --> 00:50:42,659
Fucking asshole!
Who said you had to hit me?

684
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:45,379
I should go to Hollywood.
He bought it!

685
00:50:45,577 --> 00:50:49,699
- I should do this for a living.
- We must go back.

686
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:52,254
Take whatever he gives you
and consider yourself paid.

687
00:50:52,325 --> 00:50:55,641
No, you have to give me
your part. You owe me 200.

688
00:50:55,716 --> 00:50:58,333
- I'll give you a hundred now...
- Two hundred.

689
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:14,364
My pleasure.

690
00:51:15,965 --> 00:51:18,484
I'd like to have a word
with you. Follow me.

691
00:51:18,556 --> 00:51:21,206
My partners are waiting for me.

692
00:51:22,171 --> 00:51:23,795
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

693
00:51:23,866 --> 00:51:25,873
Where did your friend get the I D?

694
00:51:25,945 --> 00:51:28,432
He gets it at his job,
together with the gun.

695
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,501
Let's not waste time.

696
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:42,158
Let's not waste time.

697
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,449
You told the cop
you have something to sell.

698
00:51:45,522 --> 00:51:48,521
A legal deal, as you said.

699
00:51:49,489 --> 00:51:52,073
And from what I heard of
your phone conversation...

700
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:55,110
- I might be interested.
- Who are you?

701
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,666
If what you have to offer
is what I believe it is...

702
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:59,234
Excuse me.
Who are you?

703
00:51:59,308 --> 00:52:02,209
The person you were tipped off
about. The one you came to see.

704
00:52:03,211 --> 00:52:05,829
I've nothing to sell
nor did I ask any favor.

705
00:52:05,899 --> 00:52:07,392
We're here to be polite.

706
00:52:07,466 --> 00:52:10,661
You helped us out in the
restroom, a misunderstanding.

707
00:52:10,729 --> 00:52:12,703
But the truth is
I don't know who you are.

708
00:52:12,775 --> 00:52:15,905
- What d'you say?
- My partner speaks for me too.

709
00:52:16,295 --> 00:52:21,988
Professionals. D'you see, idiots,
how these things are handled?

710
00:52:22,148 --> 00:52:25,692
If you had something to sell to
me you'd knock on my door...

711
00:52:25,762 --> 00:52:28,412
...just like a book peddler.

712
00:52:29,985 --> 00:52:32,570
But if you were a smart Argentinian...

713
00:52:33,536 --> 00:52:35,868
...you'd try to interest me.

714
00:52:36,574 --> 00:52:38,940
You'd find a way
to have me look for you...

715
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:40,914
and not the other way round.

716
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:44,059
You could, for example, have
a telephone conversation...

717
00:52:44,124 --> 00:52:49,010
with an alleged buyer
and make sure I'd listen to it.

718
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:52,504
But you have to be subtle.

719
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:55,540
You shouldn't say anything like...

720
00:52:55,607 --> 00:52:59,402
"What? For the Nine Queens?
You are crazy! "

721
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:04,013
And then the cop, "Please,
don't hit me. I've something to sell.

722
00:53:04,084 --> 00:53:09,200
But it's legal. I promise."
Do you understand?

723
00:53:09,522 --> 00:53:11,344
It was so ridiculous!

724
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,697
I don't know
what you are talking about.

725
00:53:18,767 --> 00:53:21,449
Look, man. There's no point
in insisting on that.

726
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:26,567
It is true that if you had
approached me directly...

727
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,838
I would've never talked with you.

728
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:31,972
I don't care
that you did it this way.

729
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,212
As long as what you have
is good and interests me.

730
00:53:34,728 --> 00:53:36,833
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

731
00:53:36,903 --> 00:53:39,456
Man, cut it out!
The show is over!

732
00:53:39,527 --> 00:53:41,501
You're here
and I'm listening.

733
00:53:41,574 --> 00:53:44,801
If you have something
to offer me, do it or fuck off.

734
00:53:44,869 --> 00:53:47,137
I have little time left and much to do.

735
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:08,632
Do you have this?

736
00:54:10,171 --> 00:54:12,079
And where did you get it?

737
00:54:12,155 --> 00:54:14,804
My grandfather gave them
to me shortly before he died...

738
00:54:14,873 --> 00:54:16,302
a few months ago.

739
00:54:16,376 --> 00:54:18,742
He got them from a German
guy he met on a ship.

740
00:54:18,808 --> 00:54:21,937
- He paid seven pesos for them.
- Seven pesos...

741
00:54:22,007 --> 00:54:25,834
I told my cousin. He suggested
I should sell them to a collector.

742
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:28,330
- Are you interested?
- Don't push me.

743
00:54:28,404 --> 00:54:31,021
I mean, as you have
so little time left and so much to do...

744
00:54:32,979 --> 00:54:34,888
I might want to buy them.

745
00:54:36,369 --> 00:54:41,189
- That would be good, for all of us.
- Come back, in an hour.

746
00:54:41,423 --> 00:54:43,691
I want to see the stamps
and then we'll talk about money.

747
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:46,659
- Today.
- Today, yes.

748
00:54:46,766 --> 00:54:48,587
I don't have much time.

749
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:52,098
Unfortunately, I have to leave
your city tomorrow morning.

750
00:54:53,098 --> 00:54:55,716
- You didn't know that?
- I didn't know.

751
00:54:55,850 --> 00:55:00,005
That's the way it is.
And believe me, I'll miss this country.

752
00:55:00,072 --> 00:55:03,583
I've never seen such good will
for doing business.

753
00:55:04,391 --> 00:55:06,147
In my room, at 4 o'clock.

754
00:55:10,404 --> 00:55:12,956
Let go of that phone!
Goddamit!

755
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,952
I told you not to fuck
around in the hotel.

756
00:55:25,023 --> 00:55:27,705
- Don't worry.
- Stay out of this.

757
00:55:27,774 --> 00:55:29,366
Really, it has nothing to do...

758
00:55:29,438 --> 00:55:30,899
What is it with you, asshole?

759
00:55:30,972 --> 00:55:32,881
D'you know how
my brother's partners end up?

760
00:55:32,956 --> 00:55:34,711
You believe you'll
get money out of him?

761
00:55:34,779 --> 00:55:36,534
- Don't come back.
- We'll be back.

762
00:55:36,602 --> 00:55:39,384
- I'll call the police.
- Call them. What will you say?

763
00:55:48,534 --> 00:55:50,028
Excuse me.

764
00:55:50,101 --> 00:55:52,075
By any chance,
do you remember a song...

765
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:54,701
by Rita Pavone,
"II Ballo del Mattone"?

766
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:05,965
Come on... let's go.

767
00:56:09,709 --> 00:56:13,320
- What did your sister mean?
- About what?

768
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:15,780
- How your partners end up.
- How could I know?

769
00:56:16,683 --> 00:56:19,464
- Why did you stop working with Sandler?
- It's not your business.

770
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:22,790
For this day, I'm your partner.
It's my business.

771
00:56:23,529 --> 00:56:27,683
Technically we could say
I unilaterally readjusted dividends.

772
00:56:27,975 --> 00:56:31,170
- You fucked your partner.
- "You fucked your partner."

773
00:56:31,653 --> 00:56:33,562
Sandler was always an asshole.

774
00:56:33,637 --> 00:56:36,156
It couldn't have been that bad
if he called me again.

775
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:38,081
Don't worry. I won't fuck you.

776
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:39,259
Why not?

777
00:56:39,331 --> 00:56:41,305
I'm getting old,
I'm sure you run faster than I do.

778
00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:44,246
- I'm not convinced.
- Doesn't bother me.

779
00:56:57,756 --> 00:57:00,122
No, goddamit, no.

780
00:57:03,993 --> 00:57:07,734
Because I won't maintain
an unfavorable position.

781
00:57:11,607 --> 00:57:13,428
How much?

782
00:57:14,613 --> 00:57:16,587
That's better.

783
00:57:16,661 --> 00:57:20,303
Offer an option at 1 9,000
and freeze.

784
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:27,944
Yes, we'd only be losing...
Let me see...

785
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:35,307
...two and a half,
three million.

786
00:57:36,909 --> 00:57:38,664
That's better.

787
00:57:43,018 --> 00:57:46,879
I'll call you later.

788
00:57:49,416 --> 00:57:50,877
Alright.

789
00:58:00,005 --> 00:58:00,952
Give me that.

790
00:58:22,076 --> 00:58:23,024
Do your stuff.

791
00:58:24,507 --> 00:58:28,051
Mr. Vidal, I must insist.
These are not the right conditions.

792
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:32,113
We should run lab tests
on the ink and a spectography.

793
00:58:32,185 --> 00:58:34,093
I don't have time, goddamit!

794
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:37,679
You're supposed to be the best,
at least I'm paying you as if you were.

795
00:58:37,942 --> 00:58:42,131
Cut it out and tell me
if they're good or not.

796
00:58:42,196 --> 00:58:44,845
Should I pay for them
or is someone with a lot of guts...

797
00:58:44,914 --> 00:58:46,092
trying to screw me?

798
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,574
Go ahead, do whatever is necessary.
The stamps are good.

799
00:59:49,338 --> 00:59:51,672
Excuse me, do any of you
remember a song by...

800
01:00:05,588 --> 01:00:06,865
How's the game going?

801
01:00:30,443 --> 01:00:32,417
A sheet of stamps
of the Weimar Republic...

802
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:34,399
with a rare distribution of the edges.

803
01:00:34,953 --> 01:00:36,164
You're right, Mr. Vidal.

804
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:39,362
No more tests are necessary.
These are the Nine Queens.

805
01:00:45,062 --> 01:00:46,752
You, pay him.

806
01:00:50,307 --> 01:00:53,056
Let's talk about money.

807
01:00:55,841 --> 01:01:00,214
- What I had thought...
- Don't think. You just listen.

808
01:01:00,384 --> 01:01:03,350
I don't know what you do
for a living and I don't care.

809
01:01:03,423 --> 01:01:06,105
One thing is for sure,
you don't sell stamps for a living.

810
01:01:06,174 --> 01:01:08,377
These stamps
were dropped on your lap...

811
01:01:08,445 --> 01:01:10,714
and whatever you get for them
is like a gift from heaven.

812
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:15,534
- Am I wrong?
- No, it's true.

813
01:01:16,218 --> 01:01:18,900
We don't know much about stamps.

814
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,878
Nevertheless...

815
01:01:20,952 --> 01:01:24,813
we'd rather sell them here,
now, without any further delays.

816
01:01:24,886 --> 01:01:28,333
But I could also get financing
or go to the States.

817
01:01:28,404 --> 01:01:32,364
I can auction them.
I mean, we won't give them away.

818
01:01:32,436 --> 01:01:35,751
- Lf we check the catalogues...
- Fuck the catalogues!

819
01:01:35,827 --> 01:01:39,174
What is it? You've turned
into an expert all of a sudden?

820
01:01:39,249 --> 01:01:44,168
It's me who's gonna buy those stamps.
The rest is bullshit.

821
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:45,897
I tell you the price and you accept it.

822
01:01:51,308 --> 01:01:53,991
I won't give you a cent more than...

823
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,735
three hundred thousand.

824
01:02:02,345 --> 01:02:06,118
This is not what we had agreed.
I will not be robbed.

825
01:02:06,247 --> 01:02:09,594
My grandfather kept
these stamps all his life...

826
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:12,156
and I won't give them away
to the first one who comes along.

827
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:13,177
Listen...

828
01:02:13,253 --> 01:02:16,252
You listen. We have
an agreement, but I decide.

829
01:02:16,323 --> 01:02:18,232
I won't blow them and that's final.

830
01:02:18,306 --> 01:02:19,898
Well, well, well...

831
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:22,816
What amount would
please your grandfather?

832
01:02:40,154 --> 01:02:42,706
- Four hundred and fifty grand.
- What?

833
01:02:42,777 --> 01:02:45,460
This guy is going
to buy the stamps from us.

834
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:49,618
We deliver them at ten and
he'll pay us $450,000.

835
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:54,164
Ten percent for Sandler,
and thirty percent of the balance is mine.

836
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:57,642
- Minus expenses.
- Where's the trick?

837
01:02:58,035 --> 01:03:01,263
- What?
- You're screwing me.

838
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:02,955
This is a trick.
You're pulling a trick.

839
01:03:03,025 --> 01:03:05,642
- You think I'm screwing you? How?
- I don't know.

840
01:03:05,713 --> 01:03:09,835
I can't understand it
and it makes me mad.

841
01:03:09,903 --> 01:03:14,025
- This is not real.
- It's not real? Give me that.

842
01:03:14,094 --> 01:03:17,605
This is as real as it gets,
asshole. It's 450 grand.

843
01:03:17,676 --> 01:03:20,990
It's more real than you and I.
What is it, kid?

844
01:03:21,675 --> 01:03:25,415
Something keeps you from enjoying life?
Do you need assurances?

845
01:03:25,481 --> 01:03:31,740
Look, you can be sure I'll kill you
if I lose this deal because of you.

846
01:03:31,814 --> 01:03:35,642
Does it look suspicious?
Okay. You're out. That's it.

847
01:03:35,717 --> 01:03:38,236
Get out.
Leave me alone. Bye.

848
01:03:38,308 --> 01:03:40,413
Get out, come on.

849
01:03:40,771 --> 01:03:44,119
Have a good life.
Why would I need you?

850
01:03:53,822 --> 01:03:57,334
- I should get rid of you now.
- You are starting to love me.

851
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:00,790
What do you want?

852
01:04:02,299 --> 01:04:04,633
How did it go?

853
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:07,598
- How did what go? What do you want?
- Did he buy them?

854
01:04:08,312 --> 01:04:10,515
- What is he talking about?
- I don't know.

855
01:04:10,584 --> 01:04:13,266
- What do you want?
- My cut. What you owe me.

856
01:04:13,335 --> 01:04:16,149
What the fuck are you talking about?

857
01:04:16,566 --> 01:04:20,273
Look, you know very well
those stamps are worth nothing.

858
01:04:20,339 --> 01:04:23,884
The originals, yes,
but what you're trying to sell to Vidal...

859
01:04:23,955 --> 01:04:26,605
They are not bad.
They are well done.

860
01:04:26,674 --> 01:04:28,942
- You want your cut?
- Yes.

861
01:04:29,009 --> 01:04:30,470
How much?

862
01:04:30,544 --> 01:04:34,885
- Well... 1 5%. I rendered a service to you.
- I didn't ask for it.

863
01:04:34,959 --> 01:04:36,998
I'll tell him.
I'll go and tell them they're fake.

864
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:39,589
If you tell him,
I'll pull your liver out of your ass...

865
01:04:39,661 --> 01:04:41,962
and make you swallow it.

866
01:04:42,028 --> 01:04:43,718
Who d'you think you're talking to?

867
01:04:45,003 --> 01:04:46,562
- 1 0%.
- 2%.

868
01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:48,870
- 7.5%.
- 5%. Alright?

869
01:04:48,937 --> 01:04:50,911
- Alright?
- Yes.

870
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,431
Give me an address
and a phone number.

871
01:04:54,503 --> 01:04:56,607
- I'll get in touch with you.
- How do I know you'll call?

872
01:04:56,679 --> 01:04:57,922
D'you want me to sign an IOU?

873
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:00,891
Among thieves, this is the way
it's done. It's based on trust.

874
01:05:00,964 --> 01:05:02,655
I'm no thief.

875
01:05:02,724 --> 01:05:05,024
Sure. I'm sorry.
Come on.

876
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:08,703
- I'm at this number in the mornings.
- At what time?

877
01:05:08,769 --> 01:05:13,208
- Eight to eleven. Except Wednesdays.
- Go. I'll call you.

878
01:05:15,135 --> 01:05:20,468
Goddamit! Is it this way everywhere?
We are fucked.

879
01:05:20,829 --> 01:05:23,348
You are handing out too many shares.

880
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:26,517
I mean, 1 0% for one guy,
5% for another...

881
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:31,638
No!

882
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:45,619
What a mess.

883
01:06:45,948 --> 01:06:47,540
It lasted...

884
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:50,840
four hours.

885
01:06:50,907 --> 01:06:53,393
- Dreams don't last that long.
- It wasn't a dream.

886
01:06:53,466 --> 01:06:56,880
- It is now.
- What is it? Everyday you lose a fortune?

887
01:06:56,953 --> 01:07:00,051
No, but... there's nothing
we can do, it's over.

888
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,508
These stamps are fucked up,
the others...

889
01:07:06,613 --> 01:07:09,907
- What is it?
- The others, the originals...

890
01:07:10,707 --> 01:07:13,226
Sandler's sister has them
at the Kavanagh.

891
01:07:13,298 --> 01:07:16,559
- Yes, but Sandler said...
- Sandler's an asshole.

892
01:07:17,649 --> 01:07:19,077
We offer her a share.

893
01:07:19,152 --> 01:07:20,843
We tell them they are already sold...

894
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:23,082
...and that we only need
to deliver them and collect.

895
01:07:23,151 --> 01:07:25,637
- And if she doesn't want to?
- She'll want.

896
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,652
The old bag will do it.

897
01:07:27,725 --> 01:07:30,179
If not, you can do
your crone seducer part. Come.

898
01:07:33,739 --> 01:07:35,461
So...

899
01:07:36,362 --> 01:07:38,248
the Nine Queens.

900
01:07:38,314 --> 01:07:39,971
Exactly.

901
01:07:41,832 --> 01:07:44,034
And what did my brother tell you?

902
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:49,730
He suggested that you were
very fond of the collection...

903
01:07:49,796 --> 01:07:52,763
and that it was a memory to you.

904
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:55,006
Of my husband, of course.

905
01:07:55,075 --> 01:07:58,685
It's true. The stamps
remind me of my husband.

906
01:07:58,753 --> 01:08:02,330
Square, sticky.

907
01:08:02,815 --> 01:08:06,905
Anyway, we dared to come
because we thought that...

908
01:08:06,974 --> 01:08:09,875
the possibility
of an immediate operation

909
01:08:09,949 --> 01:08:14,868
My brother thinks
I'd never sell those fucking stamps?

910
01:08:14,939 --> 01:08:16,913
What an asshole!
I wouldn't give them to him.

911
01:08:16,987 --> 01:08:21,425
It doesn't mean I wouldn't sell them
if I needed the money.

912
01:08:35,507 --> 01:08:39,630
I've been thinking of turning
them into something useful.

913
01:08:41,554 --> 01:08:44,073
I'm running expenses...

914
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,072
- Your commission is... ?
- 1 5%.

915
01:08:48,143 --> 01:08:50,564
We would do the operation today.

916
01:08:51,213 --> 01:08:54,627
How convenient.
What is the price?

917
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,609
Fifty thousand, cash.

918
01:09:11,909 --> 01:09:14,243
Who do you take me for, stooge?

919
01:09:14,341 --> 01:09:18,168
- Excuse me, honestly I don't...
- Cut the acting with me.

920
01:09:18,244 --> 01:09:21,144
You think I don't know
those stamps are valuable?

921
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:25,052
What's your line of work,
swindling old ladies?

922
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,316
I don't know the exact value,
and I don't care.

923
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:31,993
Let me explain it to you.
I set a price that makes me happy.

924
01:09:32,061 --> 01:09:35,737
Whoever wants the stamps
gives me that amount...

925
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:37,713
and he can take them.

926
01:09:37,788 --> 01:09:38,867
That's all.

927
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:42,450
No percentages,
no down payments, no consignments.

928
01:09:42,522 --> 01:09:45,041
Whoever wants them,
pays for them and takes them.

929
01:09:46,201 --> 01:09:48,470
And what is the figure to get happiness?

930
01:09:49,464 --> 01:09:51,372
He speaks...

931
01:09:52,055 --> 01:09:53,964
- Beautiful virtue.
- How much?

932
01:09:56,949 --> 01:09:59,915
Let's say... 500,000 dollars.

933
01:10:02,226 --> 01:10:03,567
Sit down.

934
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,908
Look...

935
01:10:12,815 --> 01:10:15,018
That amount is too high.

936
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:17,669
- The stamps are not worth that much.
- No?

937
01:10:17,741 --> 01:10:21,416
No. Listen...

938
01:10:22,763 --> 01:10:27,016
- I think we could reach 7 5,000.
- No way.

939
01:10:27,081 --> 01:10:29,055
- 450.
- 1 00,000.

940
01:10:29,129 --> 01:10:32,543
- 400.
- 1 50.

941
01:10:32,616 --> 01:10:35,997
- We should go.
- 3 50,000.

942
01:10:36,613 --> 01:10:38,620
- 200,000 perhaps.
- Let's go now.

943
01:10:39,876 --> 01:10:43,323
250,000 dollars.
That's final.

944
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,925
If we were to bring the money today...

945
01:10:48,993 --> 01:10:51,480
would the stamps be available?

946
01:10:51,648 --> 01:10:52,858
Sure.

947
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:56,155
- You have them here?
- That's none of your business.

948
01:10:56,222 --> 01:10:58,458
If you pay today,
you have them today.

949
01:11:14,007 --> 01:11:16,854
- What is it?
- We are fucked, aren't we? This is it.

950
01:11:16,918 --> 01:11:19,884
We must go on. It'd be crazy to let go.
We must go on.

951
01:11:19,957 --> 01:11:22,411
- What d'you mean?
- Buying the stamps from the old bitch.

952
01:11:22,484 --> 01:11:27,752
- Are you nuts?
- No, she wants 250 grand.

953
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:29,930
They are sold for 450 grand.

954
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:32,521
One day of work,
200 grand profit.

955
01:11:32,592 --> 01:11:35,144
Where are you going to get 250 grand?

956
01:11:36,911 --> 01:11:40,587
I have some money.
I could use it.

957
01:11:41,454 --> 01:11:44,038
- 250 grand.
- No, less.

958
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:48,681
Ah, your sister's... that thing.

959
01:11:49,002 --> 01:11:51,041
I saw an opportunity
and I grabbed it.

960
01:11:51,113 --> 01:11:53,022
I was swifter than she was, that's all.

961
01:11:53,096 --> 01:11:55,779
- Otherwise she would've done it to you.
- No doubt.

962
01:11:56,071 --> 01:11:58,558
I planned not to use it
for a year or so until...

963
01:11:58,631 --> 01:12:01,477
the whole thing calmed down,
the lawsuit forgotten.

964
01:12:01,669 --> 01:12:03,840
Then we are saved.

965
01:12:03,908 --> 01:12:08,576
We buy, we sell,
200 grand profit like you say.

966
01:12:08,643 --> 01:12:10,551
30% for me without risking a cent.

967
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:12,480
But I don't have all the money.

968
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:14,390
I have...

969
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:18,391
the inheritance plus something
I can get from the lawyer...

970
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:22,515
plus my money totals...

971
01:12:23,261 --> 01:12:24,886
200 grand.

972
01:12:26,396 --> 01:12:28,402
Where will we get the rest?

973
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:35,124
- Well, you have 50 grand for your old man...
- You said it.

974
01:12:35,193 --> 01:12:37,102
- You are a bastard!
- Stop it!

975
01:12:37,175 --> 01:12:39,149
Son of a bitch!
D'you think I'm an asshole?

976
01:12:39,223 --> 01:12:41,841
That I'll give you 50 grand,
everything I have for my dad...

977
01:12:41,911 --> 01:12:43,950
that I'll give it to you?

978
01:12:44,021 --> 01:12:46,224
For you to do business! Fuck off!

979
01:12:46,293 --> 01:12:48,975
You're nuts!
I wouldn't try to fuck you with money.

980
01:12:49,043 --> 01:12:51,595
Would I show you the way
I do business, how I work?

981
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:55,211
- What kind of an idiot would that make me?
- A smart one.

982
01:12:55,281 --> 01:12:58,760
You arranged it with the old girl?
What does she get, 30%?

983
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:01,548
How much does Sandler get,
less? 1 5%, 20%?

984
01:13:01,615 --> 01:13:03,524
- How much d'you give him?
- You're an idiot.

985
01:13:03,597 --> 01:13:05,506
You have an opportunity
and you can't see it.

986
01:13:05,613 --> 01:13:07,521
You have 200 grand!

987
01:13:07,597 --> 01:13:09,984
I have 50!
The lady wants 250!

988
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:14,400
- Fuck you!
- Exactly, shithead. Listen. Listen.

989
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:17,407
Nobody could invent something
like this unless it's true.

990
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:21,281
These things happen, man.

991
01:13:21,351 --> 01:13:24,550
It's a one in a million chance.
Once in a lifetime.

992
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:28,770
It's happening to you and me,
here and now. One in a million.

993
01:13:31,523 --> 01:13:33,497
Fuck you, asshole!

994
01:13:33,571 --> 01:13:36,733
I'll give you 50%,
whatever amount you contribute.

995
01:13:36,801 --> 01:13:38,045
Fucking hell!

996
01:14:13,747 --> 01:14:14,163
Thanks for the cigars.
You didn't forget my favorite.

997
01:14:14,163 --> 01:14:17,010
Thanks for the cigars.
You didn't forget my favorite.

998
01:14:42,825 --> 01:14:44,831
- How are you?
- Fine.

999
01:14:45,895 --> 01:14:48,480
Although I think I'd be better at home.

1000
01:14:51,142 --> 01:14:53,596
This place is full of crooks.

1001
01:14:54,276 --> 01:14:56,861
- What about the money?
- Tough.

1002
01:14:57,411 --> 01:14:59,582
I no longer have two or three months.

1003
01:15:00,226 --> 01:15:03,224
- What happened?
- Vizcardi will be inhibited...

1004
01:15:03,296 --> 01:15:05,684
an issue of venues.

1005
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:08,212
The case will be drawn again
and anyone could be the judge.

1006
01:15:08,287 --> 01:15:10,391
Not anyone accepts a bribe.

1007
01:15:11,645 --> 01:15:14,514
If I don't get the money
in ten days...

1008
01:15:15,259 --> 01:15:17,233
I lose the train.

1009
01:15:17,307 --> 01:15:19,030
Only ten days?

1010
01:15:20,698 --> 01:15:25,039
Ten days... three months...
What difference does it make?

1011
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:28,751
Where am I going to get 7 0,000?

1012
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:32,691
You can't stay here, Dad.

1013
01:15:33,045 --> 01:15:35,019
- I could...
- Don't even think about it.

1014
01:15:45,329 --> 01:15:46,855
Am I losing it?

1015
01:15:49,743 --> 01:15:52,077
- Why?
- Why, what?

1016
01:15:52,142 --> 01:15:55,969
- Why can't I try to help you?
- Not the way you're thinking.

1017
01:15:57,229 --> 01:15:59,399
- Listen...
- No, you listen.

1018
01:15:59,467 --> 01:16:01,441
I told you a thousand times.

1019
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:04,580
I've already made those mistakes.
Don't you do it again.

1020
01:16:05,962 --> 01:16:07,815
Do you think it's a game?

1021
01:16:08,584 --> 01:16:11,365
Do you think the guys
who do this are easy?

1022
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:16,866
I got fucked a thousand times,
and you didn't see what I saw.

1023
01:16:17,925 --> 01:16:21,239
I mean it, don't be stupid.

1024
01:16:22,307 --> 01:16:24,411
Don't do anything that could land you here.

1025
01:16:44,187 --> 01:16:46,193
You wouldn't survive.

1026
01:18:34,896 --> 01:18:36,903
What must I do for you to understand?

1027
01:18:36,976 --> 01:18:41,197
If you give me a hard time,
it'll take me longer to finish my business.

1028
01:18:41,262 --> 01:18:43,301
That's it.
I'll call the police.

1029
01:18:43,373 --> 01:18:46,242
I don't know what I'll say,
but you won't stay in my hotel.

1030
01:18:46,668 --> 01:18:48,042
Your hotel?

1031
01:18:48,107 --> 01:18:50,823
Is this your hotel?
You'll call the police?

1032
01:18:50,890 --> 01:18:52,831
Wasn't it enough
to bust my balls all my life...

1033
01:18:52,906 --> 01:18:54,693
taking Mom's place
as soon as she died...

1034
01:18:54,761 --> 01:18:56,354
and now you want
to fuck me with this?

1035
01:18:56,425 --> 01:18:59,620
I'm only going to say it once. Once.

1036
01:18:59,687 --> 01:19:02,588
I'm not fucking around in your hotel.

1037
01:19:02,662 --> 01:19:06,273
My hard luck is that the guy
is staying here. That's it.

1038
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:08,030
If you interfere in any way...

1039
01:19:08,099 --> 01:19:11,415
lf, because of you, this falls
through, I promise I'll kill you.

1040
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:14,075
- You don't kill people.
- You don't know me.

1041
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:19,737
- What are you doing?
- Ah, friends!

1042
01:19:20,192 --> 01:19:23,867
You are here already.
And in good company.

1043
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:26,164
The best in the hotel.

1044
01:19:26,237 --> 01:19:30,708
- Have you met?
- We've known each other for a long time.

1045
01:19:30,779 --> 01:19:36,276
- The lady is my sister.
- Really? How interesting!

1046
01:19:36,345 --> 01:19:41,013
I'm about to close a fantastic
deal with your brother.

1047
01:19:41,079 --> 01:19:44,787
- I'm going to make you rich.
- Him, I'm sure not me.

1048
01:19:44,854 --> 01:19:47,920
Shit! I seem to notice
some tension in the air.

1049
01:19:47,989 --> 01:19:52,461
The best would be for us to go
to your room and finish our business.

1050
01:19:52,531 --> 01:19:53,993
Let us.

1051
01:19:54,066 --> 01:19:56,432
Let's finish our business, yes.

1052
01:19:59,184 --> 01:20:02,445
- You okay? Did he hurt you?
- No, he didn't hurt me. I'm okay.

1053
01:20:06,446 --> 01:20:10,600
I've just made a change
in our agreement. An addition.

1054
01:20:10,669 --> 01:20:13,537
- In the price?
- No, in the package.

1055
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:16,774
- I want to include her.
- Valeria?

1056
01:20:16,842 --> 01:20:21,509
Valeria, yes. Knowing she's
your sister makes me hornier.

1057
01:20:22,695 --> 01:20:26,043
Man, it's only one night. Tonight.

1058
01:20:26,727 --> 01:20:30,816
I've been wanting to fuck her
since I got here but I couldn't.

1059
01:20:30,884 --> 01:20:34,363
And now I can.
Do you want the money?

1060
01:20:34,436 --> 01:20:37,434
- Convince her.
- Lf she doesn't want?

1061
01:20:37,506 --> 01:20:39,293
Then the deal is off.

1062
01:20:39,361 --> 01:20:41,979
You are willing to give up
the stamps for a piece of ass?

1063
01:20:42,048 --> 01:20:44,949
More than you are willing
to give up the money.

1064
01:20:45,023 --> 01:20:48,666
Have her bring me the stamps.
But it's got to be her.

1065
01:20:48,733 --> 01:20:51,035
I won't receive anyone else.

1066
01:21:02,713 --> 01:21:04,370
What happened?

1067
01:21:13,749 --> 01:21:17,610
If it were any other woman,
I'd have 50 ways to convince her.

1068
01:21:17,843 --> 01:21:19,566
And all good.

1069
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:23,526
But not her.
It's different with her.

1070
01:21:24,752 --> 01:21:27,817
- Valeria won't go for it.
- How do you know?

1071
01:21:28,975 --> 01:21:31,210
From what I've seen so far...

1072
01:21:32,078 --> 01:21:34,084
You like her, shithead.

1073
01:21:34,157 --> 01:21:38,792
I saw you looking at her.
You must believe she's a saint.

1074
01:21:39,626 --> 01:21:41,535
Can't you see the way
she swings her ass?

1075
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:43,333
There are no saints.

1076
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:50,016
There are different tariffs.

1077
01:21:51,494 --> 01:21:53,403
Do you like men?

1078
01:21:55,205 --> 01:21:58,335
- Would you fuck a guy?
- No.

1079
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:07,453
- You wouldn't fuck a guy for 1 0,000?
- No.

1080
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,461
1 0,000, it's a lot of money.

1081
01:22:10,207 --> 01:22:11,767
No.

1082
01:22:12,574 --> 01:22:15,094
If I gave you 20,000?

1083
01:22:15,261 --> 01:22:17,497
- Real money. All for you.
- No.

1084
01:22:19,132 --> 01:22:21,781
- 50,000 dollars.
- No.

1085
01:22:26,553 --> 01:22:28,374
500,000.

1086
01:22:30,743 --> 01:22:32,652
You see?

1087
01:22:32,951 --> 01:22:35,983
We are not lacking pillow biters,
just financiers.

1088
01:22:42,483 --> 01:22:45,264
- Have you seen Valeria?
- Over there.

1089
01:22:54,542 --> 01:22:55,786
Valeria.

1090
01:22:55,885 --> 01:22:57,892
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Give me a minute.

1091
01:22:57,964 --> 01:23:01,312
- I don't want to listen.
- It's about our grandparents' money.

1092
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:06,145
Chito, go get Federico.
Tell him to come.

1093
01:23:06,218 --> 01:23:09,250
- No need to bring in the kid.
- Why not? We share expenses.

1094
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,621
We are roommates.
He's got a right to know.

1095
01:23:11,688 --> 01:23:13,117
To know what?

1096
01:23:13,191 --> 01:23:17,565
Whatever it is you are going
to propose. I know you.

1097
01:23:17,638 --> 01:23:20,419
What do I have that interests you?

1098
01:23:23,843 --> 01:23:26,014
I have a big deal going on
with Vidal Gandolfo.

1099
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:45,235
What is it? You again?
What happened?

1100
01:23:45,307 --> 01:23:46,833
How are you?

1101
01:23:46,906 --> 01:23:49,010
You tell him or shall I?

1102
01:23:50,584 --> 01:23:53,747
Your brother wants me to sleep with a guy,
so that he can make a deal.

1103
01:23:53,815 --> 01:23:55,953
He wants to give me money for it.

1104
01:23:56,023 --> 01:23:57,997
- Some of the money he stole from us.
- It's not true.

1105
01:23:58,070 --> 01:24:01,745
Bastard! What do you need
to tell the truth just once?

1106
01:24:01,812 --> 01:24:05,837
- Not again. Why did you call?
- Listen to your brother's proposal.

1107
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:07,816
This is between you and I.
Leave him out of it.

1108
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:10,922
- He's right. Bye.
- Fede, Fede!

1109
01:24:22,733 --> 01:24:26,409
Tell him the truth.
I'll win the lawsuit.

1110
01:24:26,476 --> 01:24:29,670
I don't want money,
I want you to tell him the truth.

1111
01:24:29,737 --> 01:24:32,006
He'll decide the rest.

1112
01:24:36,679 --> 01:24:40,507
If I tell him the truth,
you'll go with Vidal?

1113
01:24:41,382 --> 01:24:42,330
Yes.

1114
01:24:44,484 --> 01:24:46,818
And how do I know you'll do your part?

1115
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:50,626
Give me your word.

1116
01:24:51,075 --> 01:24:53,462
That has always been your weak spot.

1117
01:24:54,177 --> 01:24:56,631
I give you my word.

1118
01:25:05,181 --> 01:25:06,903
Fede, come!

1119
01:25:12,602 --> 01:25:14,227
Now what?

1120
01:25:15,129 --> 01:25:18,673
Are you sure?
The truth can hurt.

1121
01:25:22,422 --> 01:25:25,072
It's a complicated matter.

1122
01:25:25,141 --> 01:25:27,955
Your sister is right
about our grandparent's estate.

1123
01:25:29,012 --> 01:25:32,208
My lawyer blocked the estate in Italy...

1124
01:25:32,306 --> 01:25:35,087
and submitted me as the only heir.

1125
01:25:35,345 --> 01:25:37,897
We bribed some officers...

1126
01:25:38,736 --> 01:25:40,939
and split the money.

1127
01:25:41,167 --> 01:25:42,573
Don't give me that.

1128
01:25:47,565 --> 01:25:49,287
Tell me it's not true.

1129
01:25:50,124 --> 01:25:52,359
I'd love to but I can't.

1130
01:25:54,026 --> 01:25:57,373
That thing about the middle man
in Italy stealing the money, the taxes?

1131
01:25:57,450 --> 01:25:58,877
I didn't want you to find out...

1132
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:01,668
That my big brother robbed me
and lied to me.

1133
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:03,844
It was a lot of money.

1134
01:26:04,103 --> 01:26:06,523
What's that about screwing a guy?

1135
01:26:06,598 --> 01:26:08,507
She's a grown-up,
she knows what she's doing, Fede.

1136
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:09,857
Don't call me Fede.

1137
01:26:10,691 --> 01:26:12,513
Don't call me anything.

1138
01:26:19,584 --> 01:26:21,656
That's it then.

1139
01:26:21,728 --> 01:26:23,288
Go to Vidal's.
Remember...

1140
01:27:05,999 --> 01:27:09,575
Make sure the money is good.

1141
01:27:09,709 --> 01:27:13,734
And count it.
I don't want to be screwed.

1142
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:16,582
Then put it here.

1143
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:48,149
Let's go downstairs.
What can we do here?

1144
01:28:31,567 --> 01:28:33,159
Hey, hey!

1145
01:28:53,158 --> 01:28:55,427
- Is she out?
- No.

1146
01:28:56,997 --> 01:28:58,852
- Did you sleep at all?
- No.

1147
01:28:58,948 --> 01:29:01,468
Not everybody is so lucky
to have a clean conscience.

1148
01:29:01,539 --> 01:29:02,816
What?

1149
01:29:45,587 --> 01:29:48,008
- Watch it, man.
- Vidal... Vidal!

1150
01:29:48,081 --> 01:29:51,560
My dear friend, you came
to say goodbye. Nice gesture.

1151
01:29:51,632 --> 01:29:55,941
- The money...
- The girl's got it like I told you.

1152
01:29:56,014 --> 01:29:58,403
By the way, I don't know
what her cut is in this...

1153
01:29:58,477 --> 01:30:00,713
but whatever it is, it's not enough.

1154
01:30:00,877 --> 01:30:03,876
- What a woman!
- Mr. Vidal...

1155
01:30:04,364 --> 01:30:06,599
No, he can't leave.
She hasn't come down yet...

1156
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:08,259
- Hear that?
- Vidal...

1157
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:10,239
This is fun. I can't leave!

1158
01:30:10,313 --> 01:30:13,345
"The girl hasn't come down yet."
I can't leave?

1159
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:39,226
A check?

1160
01:30:45,596 --> 01:30:49,043
A check? You are such
an asshole! What is it?

1161
01:30:49,114 --> 01:30:51,535
The guy is hung like a horse?
How can you take a check?

1162
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:53,584
A registered check.

1163
01:30:53,656 --> 01:30:56,951
A check certified by the bank.
It's the same as cash.

1164
01:30:57,015 --> 01:30:59,829
I know what a certified check is.
He didn't have time to do it.

1165
01:30:59,894 --> 01:31:01,803
He fixed the price yesterday afternoon.

1166
01:31:01,877 --> 01:31:04,527
He had several
checks with different figures.

1167
01:31:04,596 --> 01:31:07,017
He must have fixed yours
considering the checks he had.

1168
01:31:08,659 --> 01:31:12,073
He had one for 600 and another for 650.

1169
01:31:12,754 --> 01:31:16,102
- You came out cheap.
- How do you know that?

1170
01:31:16,176 --> 01:31:19,045
The hotel has
an executive assistance service.

1171
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:23,108
- We did it for him.
- The same as cash.

1172
01:31:34,697 --> 01:31:36,933
It's 45 minutes before the bank opens.

1173
01:31:37,001 --> 01:31:39,650
Have a drink.
I have to make a couple of calls.

1174
01:31:47,269 --> 01:31:51,229
- It's over.
- This will never be over.

1175
01:31:52,034 --> 01:31:55,578
- No, I referred to this business.
- Me too.

1176
01:31:57,697 --> 01:32:01,557
- How is Federico?
- He'll be fine.

1177
01:32:10,684 --> 01:32:13,846
- It's the Banco Sudamericano de Crdito.
- I've noticed.

1178
01:32:13,914 --> 01:32:16,215
A friend of mine works there.
Not a friend.

1179
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:19,891
A guy I once did a favor to.
I put him into business.

1180
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:24,333
I wanted to say something.
I wanted to apologize.

1181
01:32:25,717 --> 01:32:28,237
- Why?
- Because I didn't trust you.

1182
01:32:28,469 --> 01:32:30,890
The truth is I thought you were fucking me.

1183
01:32:46,222 --> 01:32:47,912
I wanted...

1184
01:32:49,741 --> 01:32:51,977
to thank you.

1185
01:32:52,779 --> 01:32:54,601
After all...

1186
01:32:58,345 --> 01:33:00,549
You're welcome.

1187
01:33:25,758 --> 01:33:28,311
I forgot the cigarettes.
Wait.

1188
01:33:38,394 --> 01:33:39,954
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

1189
01:33:52,566 --> 01:33:54,092
Let's go.

1190
01:33:57,203 --> 01:34:01,195
- I thought the bank was nearby.
- It's not that bad.

1191
01:34:01,650 --> 01:34:04,682
Turco, son of a bitch.
It serves him right for disappearing.

1192
01:34:04,752 --> 01:34:06,856
He'll want to die when he finds out.

1193
01:34:07,663 --> 01:34:10,630
- We're a good pair, you and I.
- Yes, but no.

1194
01:34:11,086 --> 01:34:14,434
- We settle the numbers, collect and that's it.
- Really?

1195
01:34:14,509 --> 01:34:18,663
Yes, sir. It's over.
We split the cash and that's it.

1196
01:34:18,731 --> 01:34:20,870
You're offended because
I made you make a fortune?

1197
01:34:20,939 --> 01:34:23,425
- You and I are different, Marcos.
- Different?

1198
01:34:24,009 --> 01:34:26,496
Of course we are.
You know what the difference is?

1199
01:34:26,568 --> 01:34:30,212
I can handle what I do.
You're afraid of being singled out.

1200
01:34:30,918 --> 01:34:33,121
Do you think you are better than I am?

1201
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:35,610
You are the worst kind.
You are a coward.

1202
01:34:35,685 --> 01:34:37,593
You want the money but you
don't want to get your hands dirty.

1203
01:34:37,669 --> 01:34:39,162
Do you know the difference?

1204
01:34:39,236 --> 01:34:41,145
To be a bastard
you need guts.

1205
01:34:41,218 --> 01:34:43,835
To be a real bastard...

1206
01:34:45,857 --> 01:34:49,467
No, wait, Castrito,
let me explain. Please!

1207
01:34:50,048 --> 01:34:52,152
Over there.
Come!

1208
01:34:52,223 --> 01:34:53,651
Get in there!

1209
01:34:55,613 --> 01:34:59,605
Let me explain! I was going
to pay you! My mother got sick.

1210
01:34:59,676 --> 01:35:02,260
- Your mother is dead!
- Right, she got sick and died...

1211
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:04,053
Shut up! Piece of shit!

1212
01:35:04,122 --> 01:35:06,391
For a year you've been giving me
the same old story!

1213
01:35:06,458 --> 01:35:08,432
I want my money, now!
Or I'll fuck you up!

1214
01:35:08,504 --> 01:35:12,299
- Please, I beg you!
- Stop begging! I want my money now.

1215
01:35:12,376 --> 01:35:14,415
Or I'll kill you like a dog.

1216
01:35:16,724 --> 01:35:18,033
Kid...

1217
01:35:30,608 --> 01:35:32,266
Are you kidding?

1218
01:35:32,751 --> 01:35:35,172
You want to get killed for a fucking check?

1219
01:35:35,247 --> 01:35:37,864
The thing is...
What did you do with the money?

1220
01:35:39,853 --> 01:35:43,780
I hid it. I didn't want
to risk being robbed again.

1221
01:35:44,747 --> 01:35:48,041
- Give it to me.
- No, if you kill me, there's no money.

1222
01:35:49,416 --> 01:35:51,685
- Then I'll kill him.
- Go ahead.

1223
01:35:51,752 --> 01:35:54,817
- Please!
- I'll kill him.

1224
01:35:56,486 --> 01:35:58,274
- Shit happens.
- Juan!

1225
01:35:58,597 --> 01:36:00,091
- No.
- No?

1226
01:36:00,164 --> 01:36:02,236
- No.
- Why?

1227
01:36:02,308 --> 01:36:05,274
- Because he said "fucking check".
- What?

1228
01:36:05,347 --> 01:36:08,477
- You said "check" instead of"dough".
- I didn't say check.

1229
01:36:08,545 --> 01:36:11,479
- Yes, you did.
- I didn't say check.

1230
01:36:11,552 --> 01:36:15,512
Yes, you said check.
Goddamn you!

1231
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:18,744
You called me on short notice.
I had no time to prepare.

1232
01:36:18,814 --> 01:36:22,554
Fuck off, nitwit!
You are an asshole, get out!

1233
01:36:22,908 --> 01:36:25,460
And my fifty?
I need fifty to pay for the gun.

1234
01:36:25,531 --> 01:36:30,134
Shove that gun up your ass.
Fucking shithead!

1235
01:36:31,129 --> 01:36:33,516
Do you understand why I need you?

1236
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:48,880
Why do you give me that
raped virgin's look? What is it?

1237
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:51,406
You know my business.
What did you expect?

1238
01:36:51,793 --> 01:36:53,615
A miracle.

1239
01:37:03,212 --> 01:37:05,579
Let's go.
The bank is already open.

1240
01:37:05,644 --> 01:37:08,774
- I carry the check.
- No... the deal is mine.

1241
01:37:08,843 --> 01:37:11,624
Give me the check.

1242
01:38:08,659 --> 01:38:10,961
Crdenas! Crdenas!

1243
01:38:21,168 --> 01:38:23,785
- What happened, Crdenas?
- What are you doing here?

1244
01:38:23,854 --> 01:38:25,130
You're lucky.

1245
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:27,270
At any other time I'd have gone out
and beaten the hell out of you.

1246
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:29,674
I'll give it back to you. A problem
with my accountant. What happened?

1247
01:38:30,476 --> 01:38:35,394
We were all royally screwed.
We found out this morning.

1248
01:38:35,594 --> 01:38:38,276
They held as long as possible,
and when the going got rough...

1249
01:38:38,345 --> 01:38:40,417
they sold all the assets and took off.

1250
01:38:40,488 --> 01:38:41,535
- Who?
- The Board.

1251
01:38:41,608 --> 01:38:44,705
All eleven.
They took 1 3 5 million.

1252
01:38:46,822 --> 01:38:50,268
The Central Bank did know
but they only took part today.

1253
01:38:51,012 --> 01:38:53,694
- I've got to go.
- Wait... Come. This is good?

1254
01:38:56,482 --> 01:38:59,579
- Wow! What are you into?
- Crdenas! Is it good or not?

1255
01:39:00,737 --> 01:39:03,670
Maybe. But what difference
does it make?

1256
01:39:05,311 --> 01:39:07,579
Wait...
This is for you?

1257
01:39:14,107 --> 01:39:16,627
You were going to cash this?

1258
01:39:18,842 --> 01:39:21,459
You'll have to shove it
up your ass, Marquitos.

1259
01:42:07,546 --> 01:42:09,073
Hey...

1260
01:42:57,254 --> 01:43:00,352
- How many?
- Give me two.

1261
01:43:00,422 --> 01:43:03,268
- None for me.
- Who said you could use my chips?

1262
01:43:03,332 --> 01:43:06,081
- NI NE QUEENS
- Not yours, your father's.

1263
01:43:06,147 --> 01:43:09,943
- Don't interrupt.
- Are you tired, Sebastin, or in a bad mood?

1264
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:12,569
Boris, at the theatre
do you also drink that much?

1265
01:43:12,833 --> 01:43:16,825
Know what? I do a better
Spaniard when drunk.

1266
01:43:18,495 --> 01:43:22,170
The guy from the bank called,
the one who tipped you about the closing.

1267
01:43:22,237 --> 01:43:23,666
Crdenas?

1268
01:43:24,445 --> 01:43:28,305
Yes, he says he'll come
to collect later today.

1269
01:43:29,115 --> 01:43:31,700
- What about Turco?
- He also called.

1270
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:35,152
He wants to know if he can stay
another week with your cousin.

1271
01:43:45,653 --> 01:43:48,270
What are you staring at?

1272
01:43:54,610 --> 01:43:57,064
You were scared, kid.

1273
01:43:58,352 --> 01:44:00,010
Never.

1274
01:44:00,334 --> 01:44:03,116
By any chance,
do you remember a song by...

1275
01:44:03,182 --> 01:44:07,937
Rita Pavone, a song they used
for a film a long time ago?

1276
01:44:10,699 --> 01:44:12,607
Come on, Berta.

1277
01:44:32,002 --> 01:44:34,784
Nice kiss you gave me
at the hotel.

1278
01:44:35,553 --> 01:44:37,560
I couldn't help it.

1279
01:44:44,222 --> 01:44:47,069
- Happy first anniversary.
- Isn't it too much?

1280
01:44:47,134 --> 01:44:49,271
- It's yours.
- And yours.

1281
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:51,958
- Minus expenses?
- What?

1282
01:44:53,403 --> 01:44:55,344
Nothing, nothing...

1283
01:44:57,241 --> 01:44:59,063
And this?

1284
01:45:01,143 --> 01:45:03,117
It belonged to my mother.

1285
01:45:03,191 --> 01:45:05,330
My grandmother gave it to her.

1286
01:45:05,398 --> 01:45:07,569
It's been in the family for...

1287
01:45:07,798 --> 01:45:10,098
a hundred years.

1288
01:45:10,805 --> 01:45:12,429
I remembered!

1289
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:13,482
I remembered it!
