At the time of release

2

this film was certified 15

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,715
by the Board of Classification

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,675

"making it unsuitable for those

6
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,889

BATTLE ROYALE
SPEClAL EDlTlON 2001

12
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:11,445
At the dawn of the millennium,
the nation collapsed.

13
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:17,576
At 15% unemployment,
10 million were out ofwork.

14
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:24,041
800,000 students boycotted school
and juvenile crime rates soared.

15
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:28,128
Adults had lost all confidence,
and now fearing the youth

16
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:32,674
they eventually passed
the Millennium Educational Reform Act.

17
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,554
AKA: the BR Act.

18
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:46,480
This year Zentsuji Middle School's
Class E was chosen

19
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,983
from among 43,000 9th grade classes.

20
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:54,321
This year's game was
even more blistering than the last.

21
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,032
Look, there she is!

22
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,493
The winner is a girl!

23
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:05,833
Surviving a battle that raged
for 2 days, 7 hours and 43 minutes,

24
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,252
the winner is a girl!

25
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,338
Look, she's smiling! Smiling!

26
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,757
That's clearly a smile!

27
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,096
Certificate 15:
Under 15s will not be admitted

SPEClAL EDlTlON

29
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,457
My mum left when I was in 4th grade,

30
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,626
and on my first day of 7th grade,

31
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,963
Dad hung himself.

32
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:07,019
"Go Shuya!
You can do it, Shuya!"

33
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,325
Everything went totally crazy.

34
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,915
I didn't have a clue what to do
and no one else helped me.

35
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,877
- Good morning.
- What?

36
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:38,926
Sorry, l'm late...
What's going on?

37
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,054
"TAKlN' THE DAY OFF
'CAUSE WE WANT TO - CLASS B"

38
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:31,395
Soon after,
this particular teacher left the school.

39
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,528
But no matter how crazy
the world became,

40
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,657
we all managed to have fun.

41
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:09,057
Before we knew it, our compulsory
education was coming to an end.

42
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,618
- Teacher!
- Sorry!

43
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,706
- Let's go.
- No...

44
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,666
Come on, let's go.

45
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,294
Sorry, let us through.

46
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,716
Nanahara, l've made some cookies.
l thought l could share them out.

47
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,927
- Would you like some, Nobu?
- Really? Thanks!

48
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,388
- Look over here.
- OK.

49
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,140
Say "cheese"!

50
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,269
Noriko's been waiting ages
to give them to you.

51
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,065
- Megumi!
- Shuya, you have some too.

52
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,192
l'm fine. You eat them, Nobu.

53
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:04,446
Nakagawa, you know what...?
l'm glad l came.

54
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,990
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it, Nobu.

55
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,077
- The picture is ready!
- l'm hardly in it!

56
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,516
Hey, Nakagawa!

57
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,900
- Nobu.
- Huh? What...?

58
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,008
After you.

59
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,480
- Kitano!
- Kitano?

60
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,108
Can't be...!

61
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,195
- OK, sit down.
- Sit down!

62
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,829
lt's been a while.

63
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:26,207
lt's me, Kitano,
your teacher from back in 7th Grade.

64
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:31,046
l'm taking Class B over again.
Let's all be friends.

65
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:36,509
Two transfer students are joining us
from today. That's Kawada over there.

66
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,096
And Kiriyama over there.

67
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,016
Be nice to them.

68
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,605
THE BR ACT

69
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,774
Hey, don't mess about.
What is this place?

70
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,525
Where the hell are we?

71
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,445
Who are these people?

72
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,947
Do you know about this law?

73
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,414
No good. Not good at all.

74
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:12,253
This country is now good for nothing.
Want to know why?

75
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,756
l said no whispering!

76
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,884
That hurt!

77
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,263
When someone's talking,
shut up and listen.

78
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,101
Can l go to the bathroom?

79
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,063
Chigusa, can you wait a little?

80
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,108
l missed you guys.

81
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,780
Kuninobu.

82
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,574
You really hurt my ass.

83
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:48,206
l told you not to bother with school,
didn't l? That you were a lost cause.

84
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,210
But then you really did
just stop going to school!

85
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,587
That's no good.

86
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:03,012
And now you come back
just for the class trip!

87
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,186
Listen up!

88
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,690
Because of folks like Kuninobu here,

89
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,110
this country is now a total wreck.

90
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:22,282
So the bigwigs got together
and passed this law:

91
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,368
Battle Royale.

92
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,832
So today's lesson is
you kill each other off...

93
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:36,379
...till there's only one of you left.
Nothing is against the rules.

94
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,259
What's so funny?

95
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,553
Teacher...

96
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,891
What are you talking about?
This can't possibly...

97
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:57,400
Your teacher, Mr Hayashida, was very
opposed to the selection of Class B.

98
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,492
Calm down.

99
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,536
We have here a failure as an adult.

100
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,623
Be careful that you don't become
an adult like him.

101
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:18,797
Time to watch the video.
Don't fall asleep now.

102
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,049
The Correct Way to Fight
in Battle Royale

103
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,927
By the BR Law Promotion Committee

104
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,555
Hello to everyone in Shiroiwa
Junior High School, 9th Grade Class B.

105
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,141
Everyone, say hello!

106
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:35,480
You are the lucky class chosen
for this year's Battle Royale!

107
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,274
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

108
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,694
Now l'm going to explain the rules.

109
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:46,157
Listen carefully,
then fight correctly and with energy.

110
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:50,703
You have all been brought
to this uninhabited island.

111
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:56,668
lt's about 10km in diameter, but we
evacuated everyone, so it's deserted.

112
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,338
Fujiyoshi, l said no whispering!

113
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,557
All right, move, move.

114
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,982
Sorry, it's against the rules
for me to kill, isn't it?

115
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:24,529
Girl #18 Fujiyoshi - dead
41 to go

116
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,802
Noriko!

117
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,388
- Asshole!
- Nobu!

118
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,186
Nobu!

119
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,899
Shit!

120
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,363
Right! Back to the video!

121
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,825
This island has been divided
into all these little areas.

122
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,288
Your teacher will make announcements
at 12:00 and 6:00 am and pm.

123
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,165
Four times a day!

124
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:22,253
These will tell you which areas are going
to be dangerous and from what time.

125
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:26,090
lf you are in one of the areas, move!

126
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,301
You want to know why?

127
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:32,263
That's where these necklaces
we have you wearing come into it!

128
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:36,059
They are completely
water and shock proof...

129
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,269
And there's no way to get them off.

130
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,190
This sensor monitors your pulse,

131
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,777
telling us exactly where you are
and what you're doing.

132
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,197
lf you're still in a danger area
when the time runs out

133
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:54,619
or are doing something naughty,
we will send our own signal to you!

134
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:58,206
The necklace will sound an alarm
and then... boom!

135
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,416
lt will explode!

136
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:05,755
Trying to force it offwill also make
it explode. Don't even try it, OK?

137
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,341
You assholes!

138
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,802
- Shut up!
- We can't hear the video.

139
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,096
Cut it out, Nobu!

140
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,393
Cut it out! Quiet!

141
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,440
There's no helping you, is there...?

142
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,784
- Better run, guys.
- What is this?!

143
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,668
Help me!

144
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,177
- Shuya!
- Nobu!

145
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,825
Nobu...

146
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:32,175
Hey, Shuya, do you
have a crush on anyone right now?

147
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:37,055
Boy #7 Kuninobu - dead
40 to go

148
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,238
What a shame.

149
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,784
l liked the kid, in my own way.

150
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,960
What's that look for, Nanahara?

151
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,309
Ah, something else l need to tell you.

152
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:27,063
This game has a time limit. Three days.

153
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,108
lf a single survivor
isn't determined in that time

154
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,069
all the necklaces
will automatically explode!

155
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,613
No one will win!

156
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,825
So you may as well fight
as hard as you can

157
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,661
and make sure
that doesn't happen, OK?

158
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,705
OK, any questions so far?

159
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,249
Yes.

160
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,584
Yes, Motobuchi.

161
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,296
lf l survive can l go home?

162
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,344
Sure, but only
if everyone else is dead.

163
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,224
- Yes.
- Yeah, Mimura.

164
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,351
How were we chosen?

165
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,896
By random selection.

166
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,774
- One more?
- Sure.

167
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,861
Why are you doing this?

168
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,738
lt's your own damned fault.

169
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,992
You don't respect adults, do you?

170
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:27,206
That's fine, if you like.
But don't forget.

171
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,543
Life is a game.

172
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:36,757
So fight for survival...
and find out if you're worth it.

173
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,611
Now you're going to leave
the classroom one by one.

174
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:01,449
But before that you'll be given a bag.
lnside is food and water.

175
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:08,372
A map, compass, flashlight
and weapon. Check it for yourself later.

176
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,501
This one is for the girls - you can take
your personal stuffwith you, too!

177
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:17,548
Each bag contains a different weapon.
Not everyone will get a gun or knife!

178
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,927
lt's random, with some good
and some not so good at all!

179
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:24,263
This will give everyone
a fighting chance.

180
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,309
Wow! Someone got lucky with this one!

181
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,939
We've notified your parents.
Just go for it!

182
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,984
OK, you'll be leaving
by class number.

183
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:42,406
When l call your name,
l want to hear a nice big "here"!

184
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,535
Boy #1 Akamatsu.

185
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,204
Here!

186
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:59,674
The Game Begins
Day One - 1 :40am

187
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,468
- Girl #1 lnada.

188
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,765

189
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,356
Boy #2 lijima.

190
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,866
Girl #2 Utsumi.

191
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,671
Boy #3 Oki.

192
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,972
Girl #3 Eto.

193
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,726
- l'm going, Noriko.
- Megumi...

194
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,066
Boy #4 Oda.

195
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,579
Girl #4 Ogawa.

196
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,094
Boy #5 Kawada.

197
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,514
Kawada!

198
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,939
Girl #5 Kanai.

199
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,946
Boy #6 Kiriyama.

200
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,329
On the double!

201
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,169
That's my bag.

202
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,338
What the...?

203
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:08,552
You probably guessed, but our new
transfers are a little dangerous.

204
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,857
Girl #14 Tendo.

205
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:30,533
Boy #15 Nanahara.

206
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,701
Nanahara!

207
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,627
l'll wait for you...

208
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,656
Nanahara...

209
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,076
What happened...?

210
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:19,582
What am l going to do...?
What is this...?

211
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,292
Tendo!

212
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,598
Don't, Nakagawa!

213
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,607
Shit, what am l doing?

214
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,737
What are you doing...?

215
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,200
ls this yours?

216
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,999
No way...!

217
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:08,088
Boy #1 Akamatsu,
Girl #14 Tendo - dead

218
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:08,881
38 to go

219
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,143
- ls your arm OK?
- l just had to get out of there.

220
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,937
Show it to me.

221
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:29,568
lt's just a scratch.
l'll wash off the blood.

222
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:35,115
What's this?
l can't fight with a pot lid!

223
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,620
This is mine...

224
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,331
Those bastards... Goddamn it!

225
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:46,669
Maybe Mimura and Sugimura
and us could all escape.

226
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,088
- l don't think so.
- Why not?

227
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,633
You won't like me for saying this

228
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:57,054
but l don't trust any of them either.

229
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,267
Noriko, Noriko!
Shorty, ugly, die!

230
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,195
"Noriko, shorty, ugly, die!"

231
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,990
- What about me?
- What?

232
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,200
Are you scared of me too?

233
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,582
You're the only one l trust, Shuya.
Oh, l'm sorry.

234
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,458
Why?

235
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,545
l called you Shuya, just like Nobu...

236
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,760
Nobu...

237
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,517
Hey, Shuya?

238
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,899
Do you have a crush
on anyone at the moment?

239
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,444
Why? Do you?

240
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,034
Maybe l kind of like someone...

241
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,202
Who?

242
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,664
Noriko Nakagawa.

243
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,753
- From our class?
- Yeah.

244
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,382
Yeah, she's nice.

245
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,010
You agree?

246
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,308
She's really sweet.

247
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:31,815
She wrote to me saying,
"Come back to school.

248
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:37,154
"Let's all go
on the school trip together."

249
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,367
Even if she didn't really mean it...

250
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,954
lt's nice to have someone
waiting for you.

251
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:51,126
We were roommates
in the foster home after Dad died.

252
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,798
When l was depressed
after l quit baseball

253
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,384
he taught me the guitar.

254
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,471
l had to invite him...

255
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,974
No, he was happy he came back.

256
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,186
Really happy...

257
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:14,608
But l couldn't help Nobu either.

258
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:20,364
He needed my help
but l couldn't do a thing.

259
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:29,623
l can't give this up.
l'll take revenge for him.

260
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:35,045
l'll protect you right to the end,
just like he would have done.

261
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:40,217
Thank you... Nanahara.

262
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:49,143
You never got to taste
those cookies, did you?

263
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,995
Numai's gang took Kiriyama.

264
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,253
They're not wasting any time.

265
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,658
What's this?

266
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,911
You got a good one!

267
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:53,040
Some transfer student!
Are you in this together with Kitano?

268
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:58,629
- Going to make us kill each other.
- None of us is killing anyone.

269
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:01,423
You might as well come clean now.

270
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,467
Are you listening?

271
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,763
Asshole!

272
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,065
Why? Stop...

273
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,676
Boys #9 Kuronaga, #10 Sasagawa,
#14 Tsukioka, #1 7 Numai,

274
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,761
Girl #5 Kanai - dead
33 to go

275
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,749
l'm sorry, Sakura.
l'm not much help, am l?

276
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,712
No, l'm grateful you came with me.

277
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,965
What will happen to us?

278
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,217
- l know one thing.
- What?

279
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:32,055
l'll never play this game.

280
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,814
Maybe someone will save us!

281
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,611
No.

282
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,407
Let's go.

283
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,210
Here goes...

284
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,465
Boy #21 Yamamoto,
Girl #4 Ogawa - dead

285
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,216
31 to go

286
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,695
Mimura...

287
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,373
Who's there?

288
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,168
Oh, it's you, Megumi.

289
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,587
Who is it?

290
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,594
Mitsuko...

291
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,806
Were you going to kill me
with that stun gun?

292
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,809
What...? Oh, l'm sorry.

293
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:04,731
l was never friendly with your group,
but you're OK.

294
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,318
- So l can come in?
- Sure, come in.

295
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,121
Pictures of Mimura.

296
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,540
Oh, no...!

297
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,585
ls this your weapon?

298
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,046
Not much use, huh?

299
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,382
Not necessarily.

300
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:34,845
One zap at someone with a bad heart
and they'll pretty much be a goner.

301
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,055
Have you used one before?

302
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,642
Of course not, sorry!

303
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,937
Here.

304
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,481
Mitsuko! Don't!

305
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:57,367
This is my weapon.
l thought it was so-so.

306
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,078
But actually it's not so bad.

307
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,541
l found Yoshimi and Kuramoto
dead next door.

308
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,210
Strung up all cosy together.

309
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,463
Not my scene!

310
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,840
l'll never die like that!

311
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,344
Girls #3 Megumi, #21 Yoshimi,
Boy #8 Kuramoto - dead

312
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,096
28 to go

313
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:49,169
First Report 6:00am

314
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:54,633
lt's now 6:00am.
Time for sleepyheads to wake up!

315
00:34:56,552 --> 00:35:00,889
Here's the list of your dead friends
in the order they died.

316
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,561

317
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,981

Girl #4 Ogawa.

322
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,416
Boy #8 Kuramoto.

323
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:33,588
Girls #21 Yoshimi, #3 Megumi.

324
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,298
Megumi...

325
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,301
No... why?

326
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,470
Now, the danger zones.

327
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:45,100
I'll read off zones and times,
so check your maps.

328
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:50,856
Listen up! Starting at 7:00, B-5.
That's B-5.

329
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,942
Next, at 9:00, E-8.

330
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,695
Then at 1 1 :00, F-2. Got that?

331
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:05,537
lt's tough when friends die on you,
but hang in there! We'll talk again soon!

332
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,042
- Nakagawa.
- Megumi...

333
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,961
This is going to be a danger zone.

334
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,505
We've got to head south, quick.

335
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,276
Oki?

336
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,404
l'll get you! l'll get you!

337
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,597
Oki...

338
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,941
Are you OK?

339
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,027
l'm sorry.
l'm fine, l'm fine...

340
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,702
Nanahara!

341
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:32,374
Did l kill him? Tell me the truth.
You were watching.

342
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,585
- Did l?
- lt was an accident.

343
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:43,468
X = -b over 2a...
No, b squared minus 4ac.

344
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,429
Everybody's serious, huh? Fine.

345
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,641
l'll survive
and get into a good school.

346
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,518
Stop it!

347
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,068
Don't try and stop me!

348
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,872
What weapons have you got?

349
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,501
- A pot lid.
- And binoculars.

350
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:28,471
Everybody! Stop fighting!

351
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,516
Please hear us out!

352
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:39,107
This is Kusaka, with Yukiko,
on the cliffs of the north mountain.

353
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:43,653
Everybody come here.
We'll figure this out together.

354
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:48,241
We don't want to fight.
Right, Yukiko?

355
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:53,288
This is Yukiko! Please join us.

356
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,458
Let's think this through together.

357
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,626
That's the right tactic.

358
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,962
- Where are you going?
- To go and get them.

359
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,756
You don't even have a weapon!

360
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,258
Not everyone
wants to play nice out there!

361
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,725
lf they're in danger
then all the more reason to go!

362
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,358
No!

363
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,943
Stop shooting!

364
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,073
- ldiots!
- Run!

365
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:32,619
- That's...
- Nanahara? That was his voice, right?

366
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:37,165
Nanahara!
Over here, come here!

367
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:40,043
Yukiko's always had a crush on...

368
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,878
You idiot...

369
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,998
Kusaka!

370
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,877
Kusaka!
Yukiko!

371
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:28,091
Tell me it's not true!
Answer me! Kusaka!

372
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,510
He'll come here next. Let's move.

373
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:34,764
Go wherever you like...
You're a murderer yourself!

374
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,851
- Nanahara...
- They were my friends!

375
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:43,356
This is crazy! How can you all
kill each other so easily?

376
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,484
There's a way out of this game.

377
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:50,155
Commit suicide, both of you.
Here, now.

378
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:55,326
lf you can't do that
then stop trusting anyone and just run.

379
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,124
Boys #3 Oki, #20 Motobuchi,
Girl #6 Yukiko, #7 Kusaka - dead

380
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,667
24 to go

381
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,991
Second Report - 12:00pm

382
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:42,624
lt's noon.
Are you all getting hungry?

383
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:46,085
Take a little lunch break from killing.

384
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:50,131
Now for the list of those
who went down this morning.

385
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,010
Boy #3 Oki.

386
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,638
Boy #20 Motobuchi.

387
00:41:56,722 --> 00:42:00,975
Girls #6 Yukiko, #7 Kusaka.

388
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,852
Four in total.

389
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:07,357
Calling for peace was a good idea.
But you can't have them all.

390
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:11,653
Now for the danger zones and hours.

391
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:15,782
An hourfrom now at 13:00, l-4.

392
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:19,077
Then from 1 5:00, E-9.

393
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,330
From 17:00, F-1 ...

394
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,177
Mitsuko...

395
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,304
Hirono.

396
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:42,058
Oh, great.
l finally found you.

397
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,604
ls this your weapon, Mitsuko?

398
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:50,733
- Yeah.
- Kind of lame, huh?

399
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:56,364
Yoshimi's dead, isn't she?

400
00:42:56,448 --> 00:43:00,577
- With Kuramoto.
- So you saw.

401
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:05,498
Well, l saw Megumi's throat slit.

402
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,377
With a sickle or something.

403
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:14,674
Mitsuko!
Have you got Megumi's weapon?

404
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,092
Of course not.

405
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,387
But it looked like someone
was there all night.

406
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,307
l found a tampon in the toilet.

407
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,435
l checked Megumi.
She wasn't having hers.

408
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,314
But you started yesterday, right?

409
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:34,944
- That doesn't prove anything!
- Cut the crap, murderer!

410
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:39,324
Fucking all the boys
but you still had to steal mine!

411
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,743
You made Yoshimi date all those
old pervs for cash, too, didn't you!

412
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:45,788
- You probably hung them yourself!
- That's horrible...!

413
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,541
You've always pissed me off!
l'll kill you!

414
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:52,587
Come on, what is this?

415
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,131
Stop joking, forgive me...

416
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,758
Stop faking it!

417
00:43:56,842 --> 00:44:00,595
l've had it! Why does
everybody gang up on me?

418
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,722
What did l do?

419
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:08,645
Think about what you did!
Think you can get away with it?

420
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:12,774
Cry, damn you! Beg for forgiveness
from Megumi and Yoshimi!

421
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,908
This was Megumi's.

422
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,410
But this is what l was after.

423
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,580
You bitch! Murderer!

424
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:32,001
Why not kill?
Everyone has their issues.

425
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:40,677
Girl #10 Hirono - dead
23 to go

426
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,958
Nakagawa, are you OK?

427
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,086
l'm OK, just a little tired.

428
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:19,465
You're dripping with sweat.
You've got a terrible fever.

429
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:24,595
Yukiko had a crush on you, right?

430
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,556
This is hardly the time...

431
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,226
Sorry, l'm just a bit jealous.
That's all.

432
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:34,355
There's a clinic outside the village.
Can you get up?

433
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:41,320
Hey, Nakagawa!
Come on, now...

434
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,864
Nakagawa!

435
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,441
Pot Lid and Binoculars,
what do you two want?

436
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:40,213
Nice. The drugs have expired
but they're still working.

437
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,966
Can l ask?

438
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,553
- What?
- Why are you helping us?

439
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:51,682
My dad's a doctor,
believe it or not.

440
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:31,347
Ready, lift!

441
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,437
- What are you doing, Mimura?
- Sugimura!

442
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:56,789
Great, it still works.
How did you find us?

443
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,834
- This is my weapon.
- A tracking device?

444
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,544
Great weapon.

445
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,005
Have you seen Chigusa or Kotohiki?

446
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:06,632
No, l haven't.

447
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:10,219
- Right... then l'm off.
- Already?

448
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:14,390
Sugimura, there may be a way out.

449
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,267
Won't you help us?

450
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:20,062
Sorry, but l've got to find them.

451
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:23,482
lf you find Nanahara,
tell him where we are.

452
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,652
OK. l'm off.

453
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:33,409
Always was a loner.

454
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:38,247
He said Chigusa and Kotohiki, right?
Why both them?

455
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,499
l thought he was into Chigusa.

456
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:55,014
Shit, so that's their trick!

457
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,266
What is it?

458
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,982
They're listening.

459
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:10,196
A mic' in the necklace.

460
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:15,368
Now to business.

461
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:19,038
Find the following:

462
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,165
1 . Fertilizer

463
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,376
2. Pesticide

464
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,003
3. Charcoal

465
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,588
4. Sulphur

466
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,548
5. Kerosene

467
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,427
- Hey, what is this?
- Just go!

468
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,659
Chigusa, how far
are you planning to run?

469
00:49:56,743 --> 00:50:00,579
Ahead of you, forever.

470
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,000
l'll watch your back forever.

471
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,294
Promise?!

472
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,666
Hiroki.

473
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,961
Hey, Chigusa.

474
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,463
What are you doing?

475
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,382
Training, at a time like this?

476
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,468
Hey, wait.

477
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:59,305
- They all gossiped about us.
- You made it all up.

478
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,265
But you liked it.

479
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,976
Come on, Chigusa, wait.
Stay with me.

480
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:08,064
Don't touch me!
You're disgusting!

481
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,232
Run and l'll shoot.

482
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,194
What was that?
Pathetic!

483
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:18,449
l'm in love with you,
for real, from before...

484
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:24,121
Wow, great! Wash your face
and try again, if you survive.

485
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:28,000
Wait! You're a virgin, right?

486
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,087
No way.

487
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:34,381
Did l just hear this idiot right?

488
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,676
Sugimura isn't man enough to actually
sleep with a woman, after all!

489
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,845
Keep Hiroki out of this.

490
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,849
We're going to die anyway.

491
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:49,480
Don't you want to do it once,
before you die?

492
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:52,483
l think you should be
worried about your life

493
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:56,195
instead of that flaccid thing
in your pants.

494
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:03,494
l'm taking this game very seriously.
l'm playing it for real.

495
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,913
So am l.

496
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:09,375
Put that down right now
and let me go.

497
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:15,923
Or l'll assume you want to kill me
and l'll fight back with all l've got.

498
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,469
You've been warned.

499
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,346
Cut the crap!

500
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:26,767
l've already killed.
l could just force myself on you!

501
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,352
Try it then!

502
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,106
Are you OK?

503
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,863
You've injured my face.

504
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:43,868
lt's your fault.
You made me mad.

505
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:49,665
Always blaming someone else!
That's why l hate your guts!

506
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,593
Come at me.

507
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:04,597
Every inch of me will resist you!

508
00:53:56,942 --> 00:54:01,111
Boy #16 Niida - dead
22 to go

509
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,756
Hiroki...

510
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:25,678
Chigusa... don't die.
Hang on.

511
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:30,683
God, if this is a bad joke,
please stop messing with me.

512
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,018
lt's really me, Chigusa.

513
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,064
Hiroki...

514
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:38,691
Who got you?

515
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,360
Mitsuko.
Watch out for her.

516
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,947
- l'm sorry.
- For what?

517
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:51,745
Last night, l waited for you
outside the school.

518
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:56,583
But you ran out of there
at top speed, didn't you?

519
00:54:56,668 --> 00:55:00,087
l called, but couldn't catch up.

520
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:05,968
l didn't know...
Help me sit up.

521
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:21,150
Hiroki...
Are you in love with anyone?

522
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,486
Yeah.

523
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,281
Not me, right?

524
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,368
No...

525
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:37,750
Then stay with me like this.

526
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,752
lt won't be long.

527
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:50,095
God, can l say one more thing?

528
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,728
You look really cool, Hiroki...

529
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:04,151
You, too.
You're the coolest girl in the world.

530
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,114
Thank you...

531
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,502
Chigusa...

532
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:41,438
Girl #13 Chigusa - dead
21 to go

533
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:04,628
lt's 6 o'clock.
Here's the list of goners.

534
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:07,923
Girl #10 Hirono.

535
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:11,051
Boy #16 Niida.

536
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:14,930
Girl #13 Chigusa. Three in total.

537
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:18,600
You're slacking.
l'm disappointed in you.

538
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,728
l'm adding more danger zones.

539
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:26,191
There'll be a new one every hour
from now on, so pay close attention!

540
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:31,488
From 19:00, D-1 ,
from 20:00, C-4.

541
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,366
l-3 from 21 :00.

542
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:43,167
- This is good.
- Sure is. My dad's a chef.

543
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,298
Hey...

544
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,344
Thank you for everything.

545
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,474
Have a drink?

546
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,225
No.

547
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,822
l wasn't going to say anything...

548
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:18,994
But l guess l want you to know.

549
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,837
She's pretty...

550
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:32,382
- Are you the same age?
- Same class.

551
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:36,386
9th Grade Class C,
Kobe Junior High.

552
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,640
We were in this game
three years ago.

553
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:43,101
- So you're...?
- A survivor...

554
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,438
...of this fucking game.

555
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:51,902
l was desperate to protect Keiko.

556
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,864
l turned a gun on my best friend

557
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,784
so the two of us could survive.

558
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:19,763
But as the time limit approached

559
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,473
something changed.

560
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,871
Keiko! Keiko!

561
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:57,426
Really trusting someone...
is a hard thing to do.

562
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,722
But l've never understood...

563
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:07,769
...the meaning in the smile
she left behind.

564
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,116
Thank you...

565
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,935
l'll have that drink.

566
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:01,990
But why play all over again?

567
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:06,286
They kept me back in school
and then dragged me here...

568
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,082
...to shake things up during the game.

569
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:14,378
But when l woke up here, l vowed

570
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:18,048
that l wasn't going to die
on this island.

571
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:21,927
lnstead, l'm going to figure out
what Keiko's last smile meant.

572
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,432
l don't...

573
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:30,018
What?

574
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:36,441
l don't know exactly
how Keiko felt.

575
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:40,737
But she must have...

576
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:46,993
- Er...
- My name? Kawada.

577
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,830
l think she really loved you, Kawada.

578
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:55,460
Or she couldn't have smiled
as she did in that photo.

579
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,214
You think...?

580
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:03,885
l'm sure if l were Keiko,

581
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:09,933
l'd want to trust and thank you for
giving me a reason to smile like that.

582
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:13,729
l think l'd have said
thank you, too...

583
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:24,823
- l do know a way off this island.
- What? But how?

584
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:28,243
l can only tell you
when the time comes.

585
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,955
Until then, take this as my word.

586
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:36,001
Use it to protect yourself and...

587
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,920
Noriko Nakagawa.

588
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,547
Shuya Nanahara.

589
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,010
The candles!

590
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,266
Get down!

591
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,560
lt's that same noise.
Who is that?

592
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:57,189
Probably the one guy
who signed up willingly for this shit.

593
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,191
We had one of those, too.

594
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:20,295
Give me your map.

595
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:24,216
lfwe get separated,
let's meet at the Takano Shrine.

596
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,636
Don't forget! Stay down!

597
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:38,146
Why? What did l ever do to you?

598
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:19,479
Yes, l made it!
What a sweet bulletproof vest!

599
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:38,498
Boy #4 Oda - dead
20 to go

600
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,631
Hurry!

601
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:45,190
- You OK?
- Fine. She's all right, too.

602
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,570
Take care of her!

603
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,908
Don't be crazy!

604
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,161
Nanahara!

605
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,918
Run, Nanahara!

606
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,436
There's your order.

607
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:08,023
Fertilizer... pesticide...
and kerosene.

608
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,233
Sulphur and charcoal...

609
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:12,902
l even found a truck to carry it all in.

610
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:17,157
What are you going to do
with all this crap?

611
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:26,458
"The Ticking Clock?"
What is this?

612
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:34,674
My uncle's postcards.

613
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:37,552
My uncle is an old-time fighter.

614
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:40,847
He taught me stuff
they never teach you in school.

615
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:44,809
He's still off fighting
in some corner of the world.

616
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:49,564
"l hope you smile like this, too."

617
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,108
You're kidding, this is why...

618
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,236
Shinji!

619
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:08,041
This is the trigger from a bomb.

620
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:09,959
He was going to use it
to blow up Parliament.

621
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:14,839
lt's time we started our own struggle,
but there's not much time.

622
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,175
Are you in?

623
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:22,847
Or would you rather
we just kill each other?

624
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:30,105
Can we really
all go home together?

625
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:33,274
Yeah. We'll destroy this stupid system.

626
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:36,903
Then we'll all escape together.

627
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:46,538
Day Two 12:30pm

628
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:03,263
- Are you awake?
- Where am l?

629
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:06,975
- The lighthouse.
- Utsumi, why are you...?

630
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:10,645
You really gave me a surprise.

631
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:14,315
This morning, when l was on lookout,
Sugimura carried you in, soaked.

632
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:31,124
- Where's Sugimura?
- He said he had to see someone.

633
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:34,752
l see...
What time is it?

634
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:38,882
Noon.
He just finished the noon report.

635
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,134
And Kawada and Nakagawa?

636
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:43,845
They weren't on the lists.

637
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:50,226
Who died?
l've missed three reports.

638
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:54,689
Five altogether.
Oda was on last night's list.

639
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:02,614
On this morning's update,
Kaori and Mizuho.

640
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,327
We'll always be friends.

641
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:09,829
l know.

642
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:18,713
Girls #1 Mizuho, #12 Kaori - dead

643
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:23,384
And on the noon update,

644
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:25,720
Takiguchi and Hatagami.

645
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,441
Boys #13 Takiguchi,
#18 Hatagami - dead

646
01:10:38,525 --> 01:10:40,401
16 to go

647
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,154
And a message from Sugimura.

648
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,323
Mimura and the guys are in the west.

649
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:47,367
They're waiting to see you.

650
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:49,661
- Mimura...?
- Yeah.

651
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:53,122
Here's your map.
l marked it for you.

652
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:57,543
You're safe here.
Everyone here is my friend.

653
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:03,007
There's Haruka, Satomi,
Yuka, Chisato and Yuko.

654
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,097
Nanahara...

655
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:14,769
About that thing with Oki...
Yuko saw it happen.

656
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:18,773
Yeah, we fell down a hill together.

657
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:20,984
- An accident?
- Of course it was!

658
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:24,529
- l'm sorry...
- Let's all go and join Kawada.

659
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:27,949
- He knows a way out.
- Can we trust him?

660
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:30,785
He's survived
one of these games before.

661
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:33,329
But you can't even walk yet.

662
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:36,082
- l'm fine...
- Right now, just rest.

663
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:40,295
Haruka and Chisato
are fixing lunch.

664
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,215
You did this for me?

665
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:46,718
Yeah.

666
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:51,389
lt was my first time
touching a man's body.

667
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:58,938
Do you like Noriko?

668
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:04,402
- Why...?
- l know all about you...

669
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:08,740
Do you know what that means?

670
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,742
What?

671
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:14,370
Forget it...
l have to lock you in, OK?

672
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:17,206
Some of them
didn't want to let a guy inside.

673
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:19,375
Lunch in a minute!

674
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,074
Hey, guys!
Nanahara's awake.

675
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:52,784
Really? Can he talk?

676
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,994
Yeah. He seems hungry, too.

677
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:59,332
Don't worry, Yuko. l locked his door.

678
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:02,668
No, l'm sorry.
l'm not worried any more.

679
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:06,255
What happened with Oki
was an accident.

680
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:09,634
Of course.
Shuya would never kill anyone.

681
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:11,803
The spaghetti is almost done.

682
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:14,806
Haruka, bring Yuka in from watch.

683
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,432
We need to discuss something.

684
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:18,434
Roger that.

685
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:25,274
We're all...

686
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:29,278
...going to die tomorrow, aren't we?

687
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:31,572
Don't start with that.

688
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:35,701
We can't just give up.

689
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:41,332
l think... we'd better feed
Nanahara first, don't you?

690
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,501
- Right.
- l'll serve him.

691
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:44,919
Thanks, Yuko.

692
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:56,681
Hey!

693
01:13:56,765 --> 01:14:01,352
There are still some painkillers.
l'll get some for Nanahara.

694
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,855
- ln the cupboard.
- l'll get them.

695
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,815
Yukie!

696
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:10,486
l hear Nanahara's awake!
That's so great! You lucky thing!

697
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:15,950
Don't pretend, l know you're happy.
Smells great... Great job, Chisato.

698
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:17,952
Let me have a taste.

699
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:20,288
Super!
Marry me, Chisato!

700
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:23,249
- Cut it out, Yuka!
- Let's have some quiet.

701
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:26,544
What did you want
to discuss, Yukie?

702
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:32,258
Nanahara says Kawada
knows a way off the island.

703
01:14:32,342 --> 01:14:34,635
- The transfer kid?
- Can we trust him?

704
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:41,142
l hope so. Once Nanahara can walk,
let's join Kawada and Noriko...

705
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:44,395
What's wrong?

706
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:47,356
What's wrong!

707
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:50,193
Yuka!

708
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,113
- She's dead...
- Why...?

709
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,324
Could it be food poisoning?

710
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:59,744
- That kills instantly?
- l tasted it, l'm fine.

711
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,871
lt must be... poison!

712
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:03,873
Poison!

713
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,336
Who did it?

714
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:11,589
- Satomi, don't!
- This is all just a mistake!

715
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:15,593
We're the only ones here!
Chisato, you cooked it, right?

716
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:19,096
- No! Haruka cooked too!
- Me? No way!

717
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:24,310
Nobody did it. Just cut it out!
Put that gun down!

718
01:15:24,394 --> 01:15:27,021
- You're acting the most suspicious!
- Haruka!

719
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:30,233
You didn't sleep last night,
or the night before, did you?

720
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:34,529
- You don't trust us, do you?
- l forgot my sleeping pills!

721
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:39,408
- That's even more suspicious!
- Come on! Satomi, put the gun down!

722
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:41,494
Shut up, damn it!

723
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:47,792
- Yukie, quit playing leader!
- Chisato...

724
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:52,046
- You're covering your own tracks!
- How can you say that?

725
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:55,841
You've been scheming with Nanahara
to escape together!

726
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:57,635
lt was you!

727
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,557
Chisato!

728
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:21,909
Ouch! That hurts! You assholes!
l'm bleeding, damn it!

729
01:16:23,495 --> 01:16:25,538
Different story now, isn't it?

730
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:28,082
- Murderer!
- Shut the fuck up!

731
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:32,753
She tried to steal the gun!
That makes her guilty!

732
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,338
Take that!

733
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:56,485
Not you, right...?
You're not one of the killers...?

734
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:04,493
At least... l thought
l'd live until tomorrow.

735
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:16,422
ldiots...
We might have all survived...

736
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:20,051
We're all so stupid...

737
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:22,637
Stupid!

738
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:36,901
lt's not my fault...
lt's not my fault...

739
01:17:37,694 --> 01:17:40,112
lt's not my fault!

740
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:43,949
What happened! Utsumi?

741
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:47,370
What happened? Hey, Utsumi!

742
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:02,426
l'm sorry, Nanahara.

743
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:08,808
l forgot how much
l liked all of them!

744
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:35,084
Why?

745
01:18:35,168 --> 01:18:36,877
Utsumi...

746
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,506
Why...?

747
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,843
Do you know what that means?

748
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,989
How should l know?

749
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:12,913
l don't know what any of it means!

750
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:23,549
Girls #2 Yukie, #9 Yuko, #12 Haruka,
#1 7 Satomi, #19 Chisato - dead

751
01:19:23,633 --> 01:19:25,259
10 to go

752
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:10,197
There's a call for you.

753
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:20,124
- Hello.
- Hello, mister.

754
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,001
Oh, Shiori?

755
01:21:22,085 --> 01:21:24,587
Where are you?
Mum's feeling bad again.

756
01:21:25,755 --> 01:21:29,550
l'm on a business trip.
l can't get home till tomorrow.

757
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:34,138
Don't hurry back on my account.

758
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:38,601
I'm hanging up.

759
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:43,022
And can you not breathe
on the phone?

760
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:46,358
I can smell your stinking breath.

761
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:02,541
Are you OK?

762
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:05,336
l had a dream...

763
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,922
What dream?

764
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:12,301
l was alone with Kitano
on an empty riverbank.

765
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:14,720
Must have been scary.

766
01:22:14,804 --> 01:22:17,348
But Kitano...

767
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,600
...just seemed lonely.

768
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:35,115
Before this, l always just
thought of myself as normal.

769
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:43,290
l'd get married, grow old,
just like my own mum...

770
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:51,966
But taking part in this game,
l've come to see...

771
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:55,344
l just didn't have a clue.

772
01:22:55,428 --> 01:22:57,888
There are some things
you're better off not knowing.

773
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:02,226
lt's going to rain.

774
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:07,272
l hope Nanahara can find us here.

775
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:23,455
I told you to wait!

776
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:31,505
Another day wasted.
The phone never rings.

777
01:23:31,589 --> 01:23:35,384
Even my mobile is useless.
See, it's out of range.

778
01:23:35,468 --> 01:23:38,262
- May l take your order?
- Just a minute.

779
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,723
As you wish.

780
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:45,352
All those CVs written for nothing.
l'm just wiped out.

781
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,771
l'm sick of them hanging up on me, too.

782
01:23:49,065 --> 01:23:53,110
- Miss, some water please.
- Of course. One minute.

783
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:59,199
Anyway, order whatever you want.
You start 7th grade tomorrow.

784
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:04,538
l'd say, "Go for it",
but l never taught you anything.

785
01:24:04,664 --> 01:24:07,458
- Your order?
- l said just a minute!

786
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:11,545
Shall we try somewhere else?

787
01:24:26,352 --> 01:24:30,314
"Go Shuya!
You can do it, Shuya!"

788
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:48,415
Shuya...

789
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:53,587
Look after Nakagawa, OK?
Promise you'll protect her.

790
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:15,526
- Where are you going?
- To meet Nanahara.

791
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:18,529
Hey! We're near a danger zone!

792
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:34,169
Where are you? Nakagawa!

793
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,725
Mitsuko.

794
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,270
What's up?

795
01:25:51,354 --> 01:25:55,941
- l'm looking for Nanahara.
- You got separated?

796
01:25:56,025 --> 01:25:59,111
Nakagawa, where are you?

797
01:25:59,195 --> 01:26:01,905
- Who's that?
- Kawada.

798
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:09,079
Two princes protecting you.
A real princess!

799
01:26:10,206 --> 01:26:13,667
- Mitsuko!
- Die, ugly.

800
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:22,676
Hey.

801
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:26,638
You don't look so bad.

802
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:31,685
Oh, you've got Nanahara with you.

803
01:26:33,062 --> 01:26:35,022
Nanahara!

804
01:26:50,246 --> 01:26:55,292
Shuya!

805
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:04,134
Don't catch cold.

806
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:15,479
You came to meet me?

807
01:27:22,278 --> 01:27:24,363
l brought weapons.

808
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:30,160
Weapons... why?

809
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:34,498
l'm weak

810
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,502
and useless

811
01:27:40,129 --> 01:27:42,381
but l'll stay by your side...

812
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:48,262
l'll protect you.

813
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,348
That's why

814
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:54,768
l brought weapons...

815
01:27:57,063 --> 01:27:58,897
Shuya...

816
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:28,320
Kotohiki, is that you?

817
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:34,284
Kotohiki.
Answer me!

818
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:51,635
- Quick, run away!
- What?

819
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:57,391
Someone will come,
because of the gunshots... run!

820
01:29:58,017 --> 01:29:59,935
Why?

821
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:03,480
Sugimura, why?

822
01:30:04,315 --> 01:30:07,651
You're so cute.

823
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:13,323
What are you talking about?
What is this?

824
01:30:14,867 --> 01:30:16,785
l wanted to see you.

825
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:21,832
To save you, actually...

826
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:29,840
- Don't tell me.
- l've been in love with you, Kotohiki...

827
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:34,594
...for a long, long... time...

828
01:31:12,216 --> 01:31:15,844
But you never even talked to me.

829
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:22,225
How could l have known?
You never said a thing!

830
01:31:23,519 --> 01:31:26,605
What am l supposed to do now?

831
01:31:28,107 --> 01:31:29,983
Die.

832
01:31:35,239 --> 01:31:37,407
Boy #1 1 Sugimura,
Girl #8 Kotohiki - dead

833
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:39,159
8 to go

834
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:43,497
Bye, Mitsuko!

835
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:45,540
- See you tomorrow!
- Bye-bye!

836
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,919
l'm home!

837
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:54,758
- Who are you?
- Who am l? Well, l'm...

838
01:31:57,678 --> 01:31:59,638
What happened to Mummy?

839
01:32:00,723 --> 01:32:03,266
Mummy's tummy hurts.

840
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:06,811
How about we play together,
instead.

841
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:08,813
No!

842
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:13,026
Be strong, Mitsuko.

843
01:32:14,403 --> 01:32:19,449
lf you're not strong,
you'll end up just like me.

844
01:32:20,576 --> 01:32:23,036
Hello there, Mitsuko.

845
01:32:23,162 --> 01:32:27,207
This little girl's name
is Mitsuko, too.

846
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:29,417
lsn't she cute?

847
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:32,170
She's cute and really fun.

848
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:34,172
See?

849
01:32:38,844 --> 01:32:41,304
All her clothes are off.

850
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:44,349
Now it's our other Mitsuko's turn.

851
01:32:44,433 --> 01:32:46,601
Let's take them all off.

852
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:48,603
No!

853
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:11,543
No one is going to save you.

854
01:33:11,627 --> 01:33:13,795
That's just life.

855
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:42,907
Die!

856
01:34:11,103 --> 01:34:16,316
l just didn't want to be a loser any more.

857
01:34:26,952 --> 01:34:31,373
Girl #1 1 Mitsuko - dead
7 to go

858
01:34:41,217 --> 01:34:44,094

01:34:44,178 --> 01:34:46,638

860
01:34:46,722 --> 01:34:49,391
#12 Haruka,

861
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:53,603

862
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:57,732

863
01:34:57,817 --> 01:35:00,151
#11 Mitsuko,

864
01:35:00,236 --> 01:35:04,531
and only one of the boys,
#11 Sugimura,

865
01:35:04,615 --> 01:35:06,533
making nine in total.

866
01:35:08,327 --> 01:35:12,706
Let's head west. We can still avoid
the new danger zones.

867
01:35:13,624 --> 01:35:17,210
l've got to see Mimura.

868
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:20,088
All right...

869
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,760
Got it! l got it!

870
01:36:48,844 --> 01:36:50,762
- We're done too!
- Excellent!

871
01:36:50,846 --> 01:36:54,140
- Two bombs, 100 Molotovs.
- And three propane tanks.

872
01:36:54,225 --> 01:36:58,853
lt took time to rewrite, but my Third
Man hacker programme is ready to go!

873
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:03,608
- Hackers!
- From where?

874
01:37:03,692 --> 01:37:05,652
- Can't tell!
- Can't you trace it?

875
01:37:05,736 --> 01:37:08,655
- There are too many connections!
- They're into the root index!

876
01:37:08,739 --> 01:37:12,534
- Files are being replaced!
- GPS monitoring is frozen!

877
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:23,878
- Virus invasion!
- lt's rewriting everything!

878
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:26,589
- lt's too fast!
- Satellite system frozen!

879
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:28,925
- Collar control monitor, lost!
- All connections down!

880
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:32,971
- Danger zones have been cleared!
- Do something!

881
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:37,517
- Goddamn it!
- Sir!

882
01:37:37,601 --> 01:37:40,311
What are you...?

883
01:37:42,064 --> 01:37:45,483
- Sir!
- Restart it.

884
01:37:45,568 --> 01:37:47,861
OK, here goes!

885
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:04,294
We've got to ram this into the school
in the 15 minutes before they recover.

886
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:08,047
l just saw someone over there.

887
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:10,174
- What?
- Nanahara?

888
01:38:10,259 --> 01:38:14,178
- Nanahara?
- l bet Sugimura told him about us.

889
01:38:14,263 --> 01:38:18,600
Hey, Nanahara, come on out! Hurry!

890
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:29,068
Shit, who is that?

891
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:32,405
The transfer student!

892
01:38:36,952 --> 01:38:40,038
- l can't hit him.
- Stay calm!

893
01:38:41,248 --> 01:38:43,333
- You missed again!
- Shut up!

894
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:49,464
No good, back inside!

895
01:38:53,636 --> 01:38:55,762
lijima! lijima!

896
01:38:57,306 --> 01:39:00,767
When we escape,
it'll all be together...

897
01:39:00,851 --> 01:39:04,187
Shit! Goddamn it!

898
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:21,913
Boys #2 lijima, #12 Yutaka,
#19 Mimura - dead

899
01:39:21,997 --> 01:39:23,873
4 to go

900
01:39:53,112 --> 01:39:55,446
lt's him.

901
01:40:08,377 --> 01:40:10,253
Stay here.

902
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:52,336
Boy #6 Kiriyama - dead
3 to go

903
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:03,765
Are you hurt?

904
01:41:03,849 --> 01:41:05,767
lt's no big deal.

905
01:41:06,894 --> 01:41:11,898
All that matters now
is that we're the only ones left.

906
01:41:11,982 --> 01:41:13,566
Yeah.

907
01:41:13,692 --> 01:41:16,778
What will you do after this?

908
01:41:17,112 --> 01:41:19,072
l don't know.

909
01:41:20,115 --> 01:41:23,743
l've never really trusted adults.

910
01:41:25,871 --> 01:41:30,583
My dad and my mum...

911
01:41:31,794 --> 01:41:36,130
...ran off or died,
just because they felt like it.

912
01:41:40,135 --> 01:41:45,014
But l'll keep fighting,
even though l don't know how...

913
01:41:47,309 --> 01:41:50,228
Until l become a real adult.

914
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:53,981
You won't make it.

915
01:41:54,566 --> 01:41:56,651
Why not?

916
01:41:56,777 --> 01:42:01,155
l told you, didn't l?
Don't trust anyone.

917
01:42:01,865 --> 01:42:07,495
- Yeah.
- Well, you both trusted me too much.

918
01:42:07,579 --> 01:42:10,665
- You lose.
- Cut the sickjoke.

919
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:13,584
This was my way off the island.

920
01:42:13,669 --> 01:42:17,213
Sorry, but l used you guys
to save myself.

921
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:21,843
l don't believe it.
What about Keiko?

922
01:42:21,927 --> 01:42:26,055
There's no Keiko.
She was just a story to suck you in.

923
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,849
But why us?

924
01:42:27,933 --> 01:42:33,020
You were perfect.
Just gullible enough.

925
01:42:35,774 --> 01:42:40,820
Hey, Nanahara.
Can you really kill me with that gun?

926
01:42:45,284 --> 01:42:47,952
Game over.
For real, this time.

927
01:42:52,624 --> 01:42:55,543
- Move out and confirm their bodies.
- Roger!

928
01:42:55,627 --> 01:42:57,587
Operation complete.

929
01:42:57,671 --> 01:43:00,673
- But sir...
- Operation complete.

930
01:43:12,186 --> 01:43:14,604
Game Over
Day Three 4:30am

931
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:17,440
The Winner: Boy #5 Kawada

932
01:43:50,432 --> 01:43:52,558
BR Radio Exercises

933
01:43:56,980 --> 01:44:01,525
Raise your arms in front of you
and stand on your toes.

934
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:06,364
1 , 2, 3, 4...

935
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:10,243
Move your arms and legs.

936
01:44:22,089 --> 01:44:23,965
Rotate your arms.

937
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:41,565
Stand with legs apart
and push out your chest.

938
01:44:59,626 --> 01:45:04,839
Nice job.
Glad you and Kiriyama were in the mix.

939
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:07,550
- Not going home?
- There's no rush.

940
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:10,177
l want to check one thing first.

941
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:24,859
- You know how to stop the necklaces.
- l don't know what you mean.

942
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:30,114
Someone hacked in and stole that data.
lt was you, not Mimura, wasn't it?

943
01:45:31,616 --> 01:45:33,617
Why? To avenge Keiko?

944
01:45:34,828 --> 01:45:38,581
That's fine.
That's why you played the game, right?

945
01:45:39,791 --> 01:45:42,835
But cheating is no good.

946
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:52,595
Hey! How was it? Fun?

947
01:45:53,472 --> 01:45:56,557
Two lovebirds, surviving together.

948
01:45:57,559 --> 01:46:00,019
l've had it.

949
01:46:00,103 --> 01:46:04,982
The kids make fun of me at school
and my own kid hates me.

950
01:46:05,067 --> 01:46:07,568
There's nowhere l want to go back to.

951
01:46:08,195 --> 01:46:12,656
So we're all going down together.

952
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:46,899
The only one worth dying with,
would be you, Nakagawa.

953
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:56,117
lf l had to choose one of you,
it would have to be you, Nakagawa.

954
01:47:01,581 --> 01:47:04,708
What? Go ahead, shoot.

955
01:47:08,296 --> 01:47:16,512
Nakagawa, you can do it.

956
01:47:24,938 --> 01:47:28,232
"Go Shuya!
You can do it, Shuya!"

957
01:47:32,487 --> 01:47:36,365
What's up?
Shoot me or l'll shoot you.

958
01:47:40,328 --> 01:47:42,621
Ouch!

959
01:47:42,706 --> 01:47:44,999
That hurt, damn it!

960
01:47:54,634 --> 01:48:00,389
l made a promise
to protect Noriko...

961
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:03,976
l know...

962
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:06,687
l know.

963
01:48:36,468 --> 01:48:38,761
Hello...

964
01:48:38,845 --> 01:48:40,888
Shiori?

965
01:48:40,972 --> 01:48:46,227
Listen, l'm not coming home.

966
01:48:48,021 --> 01:48:53,567
lf you hate someone then you
have to live with the consequences.

967
01:48:54,903 --> 01:48:57,780
lrresponsible?
Who the hell asked you?!

968
01:49:11,586 --> 01:49:13,379
The last one...

969
01:49:16,383 --> 01:49:18,259
Damn good cookies.

970
01:49:55,714 --> 01:50:00,634
lt's beautiful... even though
it's where everyone died.

971
01:50:04,014 --> 01:50:06,015
You can even steer a ship?

972
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:09,435
Sure, my dad's a fisherman.

973
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:16,942
Just keep going straight
and you have to hit land.

974
01:50:17,027 --> 01:50:18,652
Give it a try?

975
01:50:23,283 --> 01:50:28,495
We part soon.
l doubt we'll see each other again.

976
01:50:28,997 --> 01:50:33,083
- Why not?
- lt's for the best.

977
01:50:33,168 --> 01:50:37,921
lt was only three days, but a lot
of memories l'd rather forget.

978
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:47,640
- Kawada...
- Yeah?

979
01:50:49,726 --> 01:50:51,769
Thank you so much.

980
01:50:53,104 --> 01:50:56,774
- Nanahara!
- Yeah?

981
01:50:56,858 --> 01:50:59,652
lt's going to be tough going.

982
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:04,365
Yeah... l know.

983
01:51:07,827 --> 01:51:12,164
l feel sleepy, all of a sudden.
Time for a nap.

984
01:51:14,042 --> 01:51:16,293
Meeting you guys,

985
01:51:16,378 --> 01:51:21,507
l finally solved
the riddle of Keiko's smile.

986
01:51:21,591 --> 01:51:23,759
What's the answer?

987
01:51:23,843 --> 01:51:26,303
Her parting words.

988
01:51:28,056 --> 01:51:31,684
"Thank you... at the end..."

989
01:51:34,688 --> 01:51:36,563
At the end...?

990
01:51:40,902 --> 01:51:44,571
Kawada?

991
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:54,081
At the end,
I'm glad I found a true friend.

992
01:51:59,963 --> 01:52:02,673
At the end,

993
01:52:02,757 --> 01:52:08,262
l'm glad l found a true friend.

994
01:52:17,647 --> 01:52:21,024
Wanted on suspicion of murder

995
01:52:21,109 --> 01:52:25,571
and aiding and abetting a murderer.

996
01:52:51,556 --> 01:52:55,684
Noriko slipped home last night

997
01:52:55,769 --> 01:52:58,687
to bid her sleeping parents farewell.

998
01:52:58,772 --> 01:53:05,486
She took the knife that Nobu
used to stab Kitano from her desk.

999
01:53:07,572 --> 01:53:11,575
Each of us has a weapon now.

1000
01:53:13,077 --> 01:53:16,288
Even if the time comes
to use them again,

1001
01:53:17,207 --> 01:53:21,043
it'll never be an easy choice.

1002
01:53:23,463 --> 01:53:28,592
But we have no choice
but to keep moving forward.

1003
01:53:38,228 --> 01:53:39,853
Let's run, Noriko.

1004
01:53:39,938 --> 01:53:41,647
Yes.

1005
01:53:43,274 --> 01:53:47,319
No matter how far,
run for all you're worth.

1006
01:53:49,113 --> 01:53:53,033
RUN!

1007
01:53:56,162 --> 01:54:02,084
Requiem l
9th Grade Class B - Friends

1008
01:54:54,345 --> 01:55:00,058
Requiem ll
Shuya's Dream

1009
01:55:18,536 --> 01:55:20,037
Nobu...

1010
01:55:20,955 --> 01:55:23,123
Shuya...

1011
01:55:23,207 --> 01:55:28,420
Look after Nakagawa, OK?
Promise you'll protect her.

1012
01:55:34,218 --> 01:55:40,933
Requiem lll
Noriko's and Kitano's Dream

1013
01:55:54,572 --> 01:55:57,199
- Are you OK with this?
- What?

1014
01:55:57,283 --> 01:56:02,120
lf anyone sees us together
you'll get locked in the toilet again.

1015
01:56:02,205 --> 01:56:05,415
No, l've had my turn for now.

1016
01:56:05,875 --> 01:56:08,502
- Are my classes boring?
- Yes.

1017
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:10,462
How dare you!

1018
01:56:11,965 --> 01:56:13,840
Coming into the classroom...

1019
01:56:14,634 --> 01:56:18,011
All the kids look the same.
Like lumpy, ugly potatoes.

1020
01:56:18,096 --> 01:56:22,808
Slapping them around helped me
tell them apart, to grow to like them.

1021
01:56:22,934 --> 01:56:25,143
But not any more.

1022
01:56:25,228 --> 01:56:28,522
Lay your hands on a student now
and you're fired.

1023
01:56:28,648 --> 01:56:32,734
Now, you can't even get angry
when a student stabs you!

1024
01:56:33,736 --> 01:56:36,905
- Can l tell you something?
- What?

1025
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:39,533
The knife that stabbed you...

1026
01:56:39,659 --> 01:56:44,246
To tell you the truth,
l keep it in my desk at home.

1027
01:56:45,707 --> 01:56:49,084
When l picked it up
l wasn't sure what do with it.

1028
01:56:49,168 --> 01:56:52,879
But now, for some reason,
l really treasure it.

1029
01:56:57,427 --> 01:57:00,262
That's our secret.
Just between us.

1030
01:57:02,724 --> 01:57:05,559
- Tell me, Nakagawa.
- Yes?

1031
01:57:05,685 --> 01:57:16,028
ln this moment,
what should an adult say to a kid?
