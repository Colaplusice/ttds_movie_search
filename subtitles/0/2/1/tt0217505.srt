1
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,054
No, son. Never.

2
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:56,682
The blood stays on the blade.

3
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:01,854
One day you'll understand.

4
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,157
Some of it I half remember.

5
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,701
And the rest...

6
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,038
The rest I took from dreams.

7
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:26,045
St. Michael, the archangel,
defend us in battle.

8
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:30,800
Be our protector against the snares...

9
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,553
...and the wickedness of the devil.

10
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,555
Now, son, who's that?

11
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,474
- St. Michael.
- Who is it?

12
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,559
- St. Michael!
- And what did he do?

13
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,521
He cast Satan out of paradise.

14
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,856
Good boy.

15
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:59,013
May God put the steel
of the Holy Spirit in your spine...

16
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,058
...and the love of the Blessed Virgin
in your heart.

17
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,545
- Hey, boyo!
- Johnny.

18
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,632
- What's the battle?
- Natives against the Dead Rabbits.

19
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,469
- Which are you?
- What do you think? Dead Rabbits.

20
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,970
Well, well, Monk.

21
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,222
Are you with us or not?

22
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,600
For the last time, Vallon,
I'm with you if the money is right.

23
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,563
I'll give you 10 per notch.

24
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,400
- Ten?
- You have my word.

25
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,408
- Ten per notch?
- Per new notch.

26
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,955
Then I'm your man.

27
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:39,650
Is this it, Priest?
The pope's new army?

28
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:43,195
A few crusty bitches
and a handful of ragtags?

29
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:46,907
Now, now, Bill, you swore this was
a battle between warriors...

30
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,410
...not a bunch of Miss Nancys.

31
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:52,413
So warriors is what I brought.

32
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,751
The O'Connell Guard.

33
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,419
The Plug Uglies.

34
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:01,047
The Shirt Tails.

35
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,595
The Chichesters.

36
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:10,556
The forty Thieves.

37
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:29,408
On my challenge...

38
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:35,373
...by the ancient laws of combat,
we have met at this chosen ground...

39
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,958
...to settle, for good and all...

40
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,088
...who holds sway over the Five Points:

41
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:48,135
Us Natives, born right-wise
to this fine land...

42
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,138
...or the foreign hordes defiling it.

43
00:07:55,685 --> 00:08:00,856
By the ancient laws of combat, I accept
the challenge of the so-called Natives.

44
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,442
You plague our people at every turn.

45
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:06,487
But from this day out,
you shall plague us no more.

46
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:10,449
For let it be known that the hand
that tries to strike us from this land...

47
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,326
...shall be swiftly cut down.

48
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:17,957
Then may the Christian Lord
guide my hand...

49
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:20,376
...against your Roman popery!

50
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:23,337
Prepare to receive the true Lord!

51
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:28,295
Priest!

52
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:18,763
Look to me.

53
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:23,184
Who is this under my knife?

54
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:33,694
Father, get up. Get up!

55
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:37,448
Where are you? Where are you?

56
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:40,326
Oh, my son.

57
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:47,291
Don't never look away.

58
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:57,134
Soon be over, Priest.

59
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,138
Finish it.

60
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:22,076
You may need this across the river.

61
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:34,422
Ears and noses will be
the trophies of the day.

62
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:39,093
But no hand shall touch him!

63
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,015
No hand shall touch him!

64
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,686
He'll cross over whole...

65
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:51,397
...in honor.

66
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:54,275
Not before I get what's owed.

67
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,908
No!

68
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:08,456
Lt's fair. A touch indelicate, but fair.

69
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,087
My sympathies.

70
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:17,631
What will we do with the boy?

71
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,259
Look at me.

72
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,600
Give him to the law.

73
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:30,478
See he gets a good education.

74
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:34,106
Okay, boy, say goodbye to your father.

75
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:43,366
- Get him!
- Get him!

76
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:45,785
Don't let him get away.

77
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,454
Hurry, come in here!

78
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:52,249
He's going downstairs.

79
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:09,892
Come here, boy.

80
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,978
- You're going to Hellgate, son.
- There he is. Get him.

81
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:16,148
- Priest Vallon died a noble death...
- Let go of me!

82
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:21,737
...but his Dead Rabbits
is done and outlawed!

83
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:28,577
Let no one even speak their name
from this time on.

84
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:18,753
In this place, you have grown
from a boy into a man.

85
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:24,300
Put to death the earthly things in you:
Immorality, impurity...

86
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:27,094
...passion, vengeance.

87
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:30,598
The Lord has forgiven you.

88
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:34,101
You also must forgive.

89
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:37,563
You go forth to a country torn apart
by civil strife.

90
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,942
Thank you, Reverend.

91
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,782
Lend your hand to the work
that yet remains...

92
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,159
...that this war may end...

93
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:53,704
...and the plague of slavery
that brought this conflagration...

94
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:59,293
...down upon us vanish forever
from the earth.

95
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,826
In the second year of the Civil War...

96
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,578
...when the Irish Brigade
marched in the streets...

97
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:37,790
...New York was a city full of tribes...

98
00:16:37,957 --> 00:16:41,335
...war chiefs, rich and poor.

99
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:45,297
- Down with Lincoln!
- Lincoln will make all white men slaves.

100
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:47,174
It wasn 't a city really.

101
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,847
It was more a furnace where a city
someday might be forged.

102
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:54,682
That's the spirit, boys.

103
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:59,186
- Go off and die for your blackie friends.
- Down with the abolitionists!

104
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:02,523
We shoulve run a better man against
Lincoln when we had the chance.

105
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,525
New York should secede
from the Union!

106
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:07,445
They trying to say we're
no different than niggers?

107
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:10,531
You ain't. Good evening, brother.

108
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,950
- Praise the Union.
- The Union forever!

109
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:15,953
Go back to Africa, nigger!

110
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:19,373
- Go back to Africa!
- Leave him alone. We're free.

111
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,626
The angriest talk was of the
new Conscription Act...

112
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,628
...the first draft in Union history.

113
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:41,395
Join the Army, lads. Three square meals
a day and good pay in your pocket.

114
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:44,982
When the Irish came,
the city was in a fever.

115
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:49,737
Since the time of the great famine,
they'd come streaming off the boats.

116
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:51,655
And they got a right warm welcome.

117
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:55,242
- Go back to Ireland, you dumb micks!
- Remember that, you Irish gyps!

118
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,328
Get back on the boat, Paddy!

119
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:01,207
I only came two hours downriver
from Hellgate.

120
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:03,751
But they all took me for an immigrant.

121
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:07,004
Why not? There were a thousand
different accents in New York.

122
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:11,884
And to the Natives, you see,
we was all the same.

123
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:20,559
Welcome to America, son.
Your long, arduous journey is over.

124
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,104
- Go back to your own country!
- Vote Tammany!

125
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:35,116
New York loved William Tweed
and hated him.

126
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:39,578
And those of us trying to be thieves,
well, we couldn 't help but admire him.

127
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:43,249
Mr. Cutting, gentlemen,
thank you for coming. Lt's an honor.

128
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,292
Mr. Tweed.

129
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:49,630
Sir, please. Excuse me.

130
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:52,216
- I think you're frightening them.
- So?

131
00:18:52,383 --> 00:18:56,137
Don't mind him.
He used to be an Irishman.

132
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,306
Ah, the Five Points.

133
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:04,687
Murderers ' Alley. Brickbat Mansion.
The Gates of Hell.

134
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:10,735
Here in this vile place.
Look upon the face of this poor child.

135
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,529
She lives in squalor...

136
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:18,075
...in this godforsaken den
of vice and misery behind me.

137
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,953
Every year the reformers came.

138
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,830
Every year the Points got worse...

139
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,001
...as if it liked being dirty.

140
00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:31,213
- Where am I going to go?
- The Reverend wants you out of here.

141
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,632
You can't do this!

142
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:38,846
A glorious resurrection will spring
from the filthy depths...

143
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:42,475
...to which these miserable creatures
have fallen.

144
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:45,353
In God, they will find their true home.

145
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,148
You may or may not know, Bill,
that every day I go to the waterfront...

146
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:51,984
...with hot soup for the Irish
as they come ashore.

147
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:54,236
Lt's part of building a political base.

148
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:57,323
I've noticed you there.
You may have noticed me.

149
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,743
Indeed I have. Throwing torrents
of pavers and withering abuse...

150
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,497
...on everyone stepping off those boats.
- Lf only I had the guns...

151
00:20:04,664 --> 00:20:09,502
...I'd shoot each and every one of them
before they set foot on American soil.

152
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:37,446
Mulberry Street...

153
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:39,949
...and Worth.

154
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:44,870
Cross and Orange and Little Water.

155
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:47,957
Each of the Five Points is a finger.

156
00:20:48,124 --> 00:20:52,461
When I close my hand,
it becomes a fist.

157
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:56,716
And any time that I wish,
I can turn it against you.

158
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:59,135
I know, but we're talking
about different things.

159
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:02,763
I'm talking about civic duty,
responsibilities we owe to the people.

160
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,808
Schools and hospitals,
sewers and utilities.

161
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:08,310
Street construction,
repairs and sweeping.

162
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:10,730
Business licenses, saloon licenses...

163
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:36,464
St. Michael, the archangel,
defend us in battle.

164
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,468
Be our protector against the snares
and the wickedness of the devil.

165
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:43,262
Street cars, ferries, rubbish disposal.

166
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:46,307
There's a power of money
to be made in this city, Bill.

167
00:21:46,474 --> 00:21:50,519
With your help, the people
must be made to understand...

168
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:54,774
...that all these things are best kept
within the Tammany family...

169
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,151
...which is why I'm proposing
an alliance...

170
00:21:57,318 --> 00:21:59,737
...between our two great organizations.

171
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:04,241
- You're talking about muscle work.
- That too. Muscle to match our spirit.

172
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,285
You own the crushers.
Get them to do it.

173
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:08,412
The police? Oh, no. Jesus, no!

174
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:12,416
The appearance of the law
must be upheld...

175
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,127
...especially while it's being broken.

176
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:30,017
Give me the strength
for what I must do.

177
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,855
Who are you?

178
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:39,235
- Hey!
- No!

179
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:42,655
I said, who are you?
What are you doing here?

180
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:53,124
I just like it down here is all.

181
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:56,377
See what's in his pockets, Jimmy.

182
00:22:56,544 --> 00:23:00,047
- Look, boys, I really don't want a fight.
- Don't want a fight?

183
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:03,467
Don't worry, son,
ain't gonna be much a fight.

184
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:12,560
Don't kill me.

185
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:22,570
Where'd you get that?

186
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:25,156
I told you I didn't want a fight!

187
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:28,034
Why not? Look how good you done.

188
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:40,171
- You're the Priest's son, aren't you?
- You, get away from me, understand?

189
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:45,009
You don't remember me, do you?
I's the one tried to help you.

190
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:49,764
- What?
- I's the one tried to help you...

191
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,266
...when the Natives took you.

192
00:23:55,853 --> 00:24:00,858
- Oh, that was you?
- Yeah. I thought you was killed.

193
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:05,571
They just locked me up,
you know that?

194
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:07,740
This long?

195
00:24:07,907 --> 00:24:12,745
Well, I kept trying to escape, you know.
They add on time for that.

196
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:16,415
So, what are you doing back here?

197
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,126
I guess I missed the place.

198
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,718
Bowery Boys.

199
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:41,607
Get back here!

200
00:24:41,774 --> 00:24:44,610
The Five Points, Paradise Square.

201
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:47,822
The streets here are always lively
of an evening.

202
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:50,533
Who are the gangs around now?

203
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,660
The Daybreak Boys
and the Swamp Angels.

204
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:54,996
They work the river, looting ships.

205
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,873
The frog Hollows shanghai sailors
by the Bloody Angle.

206
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,544
The Shirt Tails was rough,
but they've become a bunch of dandies...

207
00:25:01,711 --> 00:25:04,630
...Iolling around Murderers' Alley,
looking like Chinamen.

208
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,591
Hell-Cat Maggie, she tried to open
her own grog shop.

209
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:10,386
She drunk her own liquor
and got throwed on the street.

210
00:25:10,553 --> 00:25:13,097
- Beautiful.
- Now she's on the lay for anything.

211
00:25:13,264 --> 00:25:15,808
The Plug Uglies are from deep
in the old country.

212
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:18,227
Got their own language
no one understands.

213
00:25:18,394 --> 00:25:21,772
They love to fight the cops.
The Night Walkers of Ragpicker's Row.

214
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:24,900
They work on their backs
and kill with their hands.

215
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:28,821
They're so scurvy only the Plug Uglies
talk to them. But who understands them?

216
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:31,532
The Slaughter Housers
and the Broadway Twisters.

217
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:34,827
They're a fine bunch of bingo boys.
And the Little forty Thieves.

218
00:25:34,994 --> 00:25:36,412
I used to run with them...

219
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:39,498
...till they got took over
by Bendrick the Cockroach.

220
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:41,167
Bendrick carries a germ.

221
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:44,253
If you try to leave the gang,
he hacks up blood on you.

222
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,840
The lime-juicers are nothing but
a bunch of rapacious grab-ups.

223
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:50,885
The True Blue Americans
say they're a gang...

224
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:53,804
...but all they do is stand on corners
damning England.

225
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:57,266
If you believe one word
the British say, you're a fool.

226
00:25:57,433 --> 00:26:00,770
Do any of them got the sand
of the Dead Rabbits?

227
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:06,567
You don't say that name.

228
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:11,405
That name died with your...
They been outlawed.

229
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:13,908
In the blockhouse,
the Chinks told me...

230
00:26:14,075 --> 00:26:18,412
...that the Natives celebrate their victory
every year. Is that true?

231
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:21,457
Aye, that they do. Lt's quite the affair.

232
00:26:21,624 --> 00:26:24,502
The Butcher himself's got to invite you,
or you don't go.

233
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:38,015
Look where you're going, Johnny.

234
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,604
You look stunned and poorly, sir.

235
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:51,112
Quite a pair of conversationists,
aren't you?

236
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:56,951
Maybe not, but we're deep thinkers.

237
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:06,460
Well, gentlemen, I leave you
in the grace and favor of the Lord.

238
00:27:13,551 --> 00:27:16,220
Jenny, the finest bludget
in all the Points.

239
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:18,973
She is a prim-looking stargazer.

240
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:23,978
But I'd check my pockets if I was you...

241
00:27:24,145 --> 00:27:27,398
...because I do believe she lifted
your timepiece.

242
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:33,821
Well, I let her take it.

243
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:36,741
I let her take things all the time.

244
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,785
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

245
00:27:44,332 --> 00:27:46,751
We always liked a good fire
in the Points.

246
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:53,674
You could pick up a little swag. And
if the cops came, you really got a show.

247
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:57,261
The Municipal Police fought
the Metropolitan Police.

248
00:27:57,428 --> 00:28:00,181
The Metropolitan Police,
they fought the street gangs.

249
00:28:00,348 --> 00:28:02,767
Hurry up, men,
before the Black Joke get there!

250
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:06,687
There were 37 amateur fire brigades,
and they all fought each other.

251
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:12,777
The Black Joke are on their way, Tweed,
and they'll beat the shite out of you.

252
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:21,035
Okay, boys, get the hose out!

253
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:28,793
Lt's the Black Joke!

254
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,379
Go get them, boys!

255
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:34,507
Give those Bowery Boys hell!

256
00:28:34,674 --> 00:28:38,302
- Quick, before there's nothing left.
- Go back to the Bowery, you bums!

257
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:41,305
Stop them. For Gos sake,
they're taking everything!

258
00:28:41,472 --> 00:28:44,225
In your next time of trouble,
call on Tammany first.

259
00:28:44,392 --> 00:28:47,728
But it's not too late.
You can still save my house.

260
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:50,064
Let's go.

261
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:53,734
I thought you said you was hungry.

262
00:28:57,154 --> 00:29:00,700
Grab what you can, Johnny.
Let's get out of here.

263
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:04,245
May I point out that this building
is burning to ashes?

264
00:29:04,412 --> 00:29:08,749
May I point out this area is the province
of my own Americus fire Brigade...

265
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:12,378
...and that you lot belong
only in the Bowery?

266
00:29:13,546 --> 00:29:16,590
May I point out that you're outmanned,
outmaneuvered...

267
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:18,884
...and, in a moment, outfought?

268
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:20,886
Am I?

269
00:29:26,726 --> 00:29:29,895
There's the Black Joke!
Let's take them on the cobbles.

270
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:34,442
Go spill some claret, boys.
Go on, Shorty, have a nice muss.

271
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:37,278
Clear the way for Bill the Butcher.

272
00:29:37,445 --> 00:29:39,613
Okay, boys, to work.

273
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,452
What's the point? The fire's near burned
anything of value inside.

274
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:47,913
Boys, forget that one.
Next building over.

275
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,916
Mustn't let it spread.
Take what you want from that one.

276
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,126
What are you doing?

277
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:55,087
There's nothing wrong with this one.
This is my house.

278
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:00,384
- Johnny!
- Help!

279
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,054
- Johnny!
- Help!

280
00:30:04,472 --> 00:30:07,266
Help! Help!

281
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:13,022
Help!

282
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:19,153
Come on. Come on, Johnny, get up.

283
00:30:19,612 --> 00:30:21,530
Leave that!

284
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:30,247
You two, out of the way!

285
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,850
His name's Amsterdam.

286
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:55,356
- How's the beak?
- Ain't so bad.

287
00:30:55,523 --> 00:30:59,610
You. You got anything,
you give it up or you get out.

288
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,707
Is that it?

289
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:15,084
That's it.

290
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:19,880
Right. Here's the rake.
Everything comes here. We fence it.

291
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:23,509
Johnny takes our tribute to the Natives,
and we chop up the winnings...

292
00:31:23,676 --> 00:31:27,179
...each to his equal portion,
amongst the gang.

293
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:30,850
Does that meet
with your approval, Hellgate?

294
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:32,643
My approval?

295
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,688
What's the matter, Jack Sprat?
Can't think for yourself?

296
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:40,359
- I'll slit your fucking throat!
- Hey, come on!

297
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:41,736
Hey!

298
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:49,243
You boys will settle with me
before settling with each other.

299
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:55,416
I come for my due and proper.

300
00:32:14,352 --> 00:32:16,520
Well, this ain't a bad haul.

301
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:20,566
When folks start in to saying
to where the country is going to hell...

302
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:23,694
...I always tell them,
"You just look at all the hard work...

303
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:27,281
...our fine young lads is doing
down in the Five Points."

304
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:31,494
Oh, yeah. Now this is just
the thing for Mrs. Mulraney.

305
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:33,996
All right there, Happy Jack,
leave us something...

306
00:32:34,163 --> 00:32:36,540
...to quarter to Bill the Butcher, eh?

307
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:38,292
Would you?

308
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:52,473
Not my favorite tune.

309
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:01,899
Thank you, boys.

310
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:05,444
You keep out of trouble now.

311
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:27,633
Every year the Natives celebrated
the killing of my father all over again...

312
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,348
...at Sparrow's Chinese Pagoda
in Mott Street.

313
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:38,185
The Chinks hated the Natives
worse than we did.

314
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:45,359
The drum rolls, and the Butcher
drinks a glass of fire.

315
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:51,907
When you kill a king...

316
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,411
...you don 't stab him in the dark.

317
00:33:56,829 --> 00:34:02,084
You kill him where the whole court
can watch him die.

318
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:08,549
Hey, you got any timber?

319
00:34:58,516 --> 00:35:02,353
- Hey, Maggie. Right ear or left ear?
- Give us a drink, you idiot.

320
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,146
Help yourself.

321
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:06,190
- Final bets!
- To health.

322
00:35:06,357 --> 00:35:09,443
Place your bets.
Betting closes in two minutes.

323
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,903
Place your bets.

324
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:15,241
Gentlemen, the match
is due to commence.

325
00:35:15,408 --> 00:35:18,953
The count to beat is 25 rodents
in three minutes.

326
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,414
Towser against the vermin.

327
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,290
- Are the enumerators satisfied?
- Fifty!

328
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:25,584
- Yes!
- Let them go!

329
00:35:39,432 --> 00:35:42,560
- Where you going, boy?
- I'm here to pay tribute to Bill.

330
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:45,146
Are you now? Give it to me.
I'll give it to him.

331
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:48,107
No, thanks. I'll give it to him myself.

332
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:52,236
What do you want to keep,
the money or your teeth?

333
00:35:52,403 --> 00:35:54,113
John.

334
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:56,657
Welcome.

335
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:07,168
From me and me lads, sir.

336
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:17,094
Mate of yours? Where's he from?

337
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,014
Oh, he's not from here, sir.

338
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:24,393
You.

339
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:43,954
That's close enough.

340
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:59,553
Your friend can't look me in the eye.
That's not an admirable characteristic.

341
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,641
No one can look you in the eye, Bill.
Not when you're playing cards.

342
00:37:22,243 --> 00:37:25,913
This is whist. Lt's a gentleman's game.
Make a gentleman's bet.

343
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:30,543
- I'm betting large, Bill.
- That ain't large.

344
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:42,179
Please, don't make that noise again,
Harvey.

345
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:48,019
I like a man who's willing
to burn for his swag.

346
00:37:51,397 --> 00:37:54,066
How do you fare on water?
Come closer.

347
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:57,570
Close, John. I ain't gonna bite. Close.

348
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:04,952
There's a Portuguese ship lying low
in the harbor, quarantined three weeks.

349
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,288
Get there before
the Daybreak Boys strip her...

350
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:09,123
...maybe you and me will talk more.

351
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,834
- Consider it done, sir.
- Good boy.

352
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,630
And you, whatever your name is...
What is your name?

353
00:38:20,301 --> 00:38:26,682
- Amsterdam, sir.
- Amsterdam. I'm New York.

354
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:29,435
Don't you never come in here
empty-handed again.

355
00:38:29,602 --> 00:38:32,980
You gotta pay for the pleasure
of my company.

356
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:35,066
Take him for a boat ride, John.

357
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:38,361
Who knows, but he might
save your life again.

358
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:44,784
The Daybreak Boys catch us,
they'll slit our throats.

359
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,662
I'll do it myself in a minute
if you don't keep quiet.

360
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:50,998
I never liked the harbor after dark.

361
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:54,543
And now each night they brung ashore
the bodies of the soldiers.

362
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,629
Many mothers have not
even the solace...

363
00:38:56,796 --> 00:38:59,173
...of knowing where
their sons have fallen.

364
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,051
I lost my own eldest at Antietam.

365
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:04,845
His mother and I were unable
to recover his remains.

366
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:07,723
- It was a mournful sight.
- The war can't last forever.

367
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,601
But we had business of our own.

368
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:24,323
The Daybreak Boys have been here,
and there's nothing left. Let's go back.

369
00:39:27,952 --> 00:39:30,496
What the hell?

370
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:39,463
Jimmy, get down!

371
00:39:41,674 --> 00:39:45,553
Jesus, that'll bring the harbor cops
for sure. Fuck off.

372
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:55,354
Let's take a look.

373
00:39:58,065 --> 00:40:00,401
Jesus, they killed everybody.

374
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:03,404
There's nothing here but a bunch
of dead sea-crabs.

375
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:05,865
Come on, let's go.

376
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,910
- Shove off.
- No, wait for Amsterdam.

377
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:12,246
Where's Amsterdam?

378
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:17,251
- No, you damn fool, take him!
- What in the hell for?!

379
00:40:17,418 --> 00:40:19,545
Look in my glims.
I said no less than 15.

380
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,090
- Is this fresh?
- Four hours most.

381
00:40:23,424 --> 00:40:26,010
Much obliged, gents.

382
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:35,186
What's that word?

383
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:38,439
- It means body snatchers.
- I didn't ask the meaning.

384
00:40:38,606 --> 00:40:39,940
I asked the word.

385
00:40:40,608 --> 00:40:42,109
Ghoul.

386
00:40:43,653 --> 00:40:47,073
Ghoul? That's a good word.

387
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:53,579
"Ghoul Gang Slaughters.
A fresh Outrage in the Five Points."

388
00:40:53,746 --> 00:40:56,207
- That's a notice you can be proud of.
- Thank you.

389
00:40:56,374 --> 00:41:00,127
A low thing, to do that to a body.
Low.

390
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:02,588
Why? They could have left
that ship with nothing.

391
00:41:02,755 --> 00:41:06,967
Instead they made The Police Gazette,
a periodical of note.

392
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:09,512
A body's supposed to stay
beneath the earth...

393
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,848
...wearing a wooden coat
until the Resurrection.

394
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:15,976
These two are a pair of sons
of Irish bitches, same as you.

395
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:18,187
It don't seem to bother them none.

396
00:41:18,354 --> 00:41:21,273
But then maybe they don't share
your religious scruples.

397
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,235
Maybe they're just a couple
of fidlam Bens.

398
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:33,828
I've been called a lot of things, mister,
but I ain't never been called...

399
00:41:33,995 --> 00:41:37,665
- fidlam Bens.
- Fidlam Bens. Right.

400
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:44,213
Well, if I knew what in the hell that
meant, I'd be inclined to take offense.

401
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:48,634
A fidlam Bens is a fellow
who steals anything, dead or alive...

402
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:51,846
...because he's too low to work up
a decent lay for himself.

403
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:54,306
Count that careful, Bill.
Count that careful.

404
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:57,518
- I'm telling you, that's all there is...
- Now, chiseler...

405
00:41:57,685 --> 00:42:01,230
If you'd said "chiseler," now there's
a word I understand. You know?

406
00:42:01,397 --> 00:42:05,526
- Now, is that what you're calling us?
- I can think of many things to call you.

407
00:42:05,693 --> 00:42:08,988
Right. But I asked
if you was calling us chiselers.

408
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:11,907
Supposing I am?

409
00:42:13,868 --> 00:42:16,537
Well, then we got business.

410
00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:19,749
That we do.

411
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:29,508
- A fight! There's a fight!
- Two bucks on McGloin.

412
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:32,136
- Four bits on the kid.
- Five bits on the kid.

413
00:42:32,303 --> 00:42:35,181
I got two on Amsterdam.

414
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:47,068
Come on, McGloin, he's just a kid.

415
00:42:47,652 --> 00:42:50,237
Four bits to back Amsterdam.

416
00:42:56,911 --> 00:42:59,830
Watch his left, McGloin. Watch his left.

417
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:42,581
- All right, that'll do. That'll do.
- Anything to say now, huh?!

418
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:45,376
That'll do, for chrissake.
Drag him off.

419
00:43:45,543 --> 00:43:48,713
- That's enough, kid.
- You got him. Come on, kid, you won.

420
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:51,716
McGloin. He's a kid too, McGloin.

421
00:43:51,882 --> 00:43:54,468
You're getting too old for it, McGloin.

422
00:44:16,032 --> 00:44:21,495
McGloin, how would that head look
without the ears and the nose on it?

423
00:44:22,747 --> 00:44:25,166
You'd better leave
that head alone, Bill.

424
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:28,836
I think I'm gonna trim the ears
and the beak off of that head.

425
00:44:30,171 --> 00:44:32,340
Make a nice pot of soup of that head.

426
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:35,259
You could find a tastier head
than that, Bill.

427
00:44:35,426 --> 00:44:38,846
I ain't got the stomach for no Irish stew.

428
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:46,354
The mighty McGloin
almost fishhooked by a sprat.

429
00:44:55,029 --> 00:44:59,200
On the seventh day, the Lord rested,
but before that he did...

430
00:44:59,367 --> 00:45:05,247
...he squatted over the side of England,
and what came out of him was Ireland.

431
00:45:05,414 --> 00:45:09,460
- No offense, son.
- Oh, none taken, sir. I grew up here.

432
00:45:09,627 --> 00:45:14,173
All I ever knew of Ireland was in the
talk of the others at the orphan asylum.

433
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:19,303
In which part of that excrementitious
isle were your forebears spawned?

434
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:25,101
I've been told Kerry, but I lost proof
of it in my language at the asylum.

435
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:28,562
I was raised in a very similar
establishment myself.

436
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:32,149
Now everything you see belongs to me,
to one degree or another.

437
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:35,403
The beggars and newsboys
and quick thieves here in Paradise.

438
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:39,115
The sailor dives and gin mills
and blind tigers on the waterfront.

439
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:42,243
The anglers and amusers,
the she-hes and the Chinks.

440
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:44,245
Everybody owes, everybody pays...

441
00:45:44,412 --> 00:45:50,292
...because that's how you stand up
against the rising of the tide.

442
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:53,713
- Is that right, boys?
- Yeah, Bill. That's right.

443
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:56,048
Enlist. Join up. Serve your country.

444
00:45:56,882 --> 00:45:59,677
Come on in out of the draft, boys.

445
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:02,096
Volunteer and get your $50 bonus.

446
00:46:03,973 --> 00:46:08,269
We need 30,000 volunteers, and we're
prepared to pay $677 per volunteer.

447
00:46:08,436 --> 00:46:10,771
- Please read this. Thank you.
- Thanks.

448
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:13,399
Would you like to take
one of these to fill out?

449
00:46:13,566 --> 00:46:17,111
Three square meals a day.
Three square meals a day.

450
00:46:17,278 --> 00:46:20,072
Young man, enlist
and serve your country.

451
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:22,199
Three square meals a day, gentlemen.

452
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:25,036
If you're interested,
read this and consider joining.

453
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:28,039
Everywhere you went
people talked about the draft.

454
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:31,417
Now, you could buy
your way out for $300...

455
00:46:31,584 --> 00:46:33,669
...but who had $300?

456
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:36,630
For us it might as well
have been 3 million.

457
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:40,801
The recruiters? They was too scared
of the gangs to come after us.

458
00:46:40,968 --> 00:46:45,806
Besides, we never dreamt the war
would ever touch New York.

459
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:47,391
Good morning, sir.

460
00:46:49,352 --> 00:46:50,811
You!

461
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:52,980
Don't you run into me.

462
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:56,067
Fair enough.

463
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,990
I said, don't run into me!

464
00:47:03,157 --> 00:47:05,326
Well, sorry.

465
00:47:11,123 --> 00:47:14,502
- Everything in place?
- It seems so.

466
00:47:14,669 --> 00:47:17,630
Well, then I leave you
in the grace and favor of the Lord.

467
00:47:17,797 --> 00:47:19,965
- Thank you.
- That's right.

468
00:47:27,515 --> 00:47:30,851
Oh, the dirty mab!

469
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:36,107
Oh, no.

470
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:38,734
- I'm sorry.
- Allow me.

471
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:44,532
- Thank you kindly, sir.
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

472
00:47:45,282 --> 00:47:47,493
I hope you won't think
me rude if I speak.

473
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,870
I wouldn't want to appear forward.

474
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:54,875
Well, sir, that depends
on what you say.

475
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,221
Would you call me reckless if I said
you were the prettiest girl in New York?

476
00:48:07,388 --> 00:48:10,099
Only New York?

477
00:48:11,934 --> 00:48:13,185
This is my stop.

478
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:18,316
May I walk with you a little then?

479
00:48:18,482 --> 00:48:21,235
That, sir, would be too bold.

480
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:40,004
Good morning.

481
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:51,932
For every lay we had a different name.

482
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:54,393
An "angler" put a hook
on the end of a stick...

483
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,688
...to drop behind
store windows and doors.

484
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,442
An "autumn diver"
picked your pocket in church.

485
00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:04,153
A "badger" gets a fellow
into bed with a girl...

486
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,281
...then robs his pockets
while they're on the go.

487
00:49:07,782 --> 00:49:11,535
Jenny was a "bludget,"
a girl pickpocket...

488
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:15,623
...and a "turtledove."

489
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:20,503
A turtledove goes uptown
dressed like a housemaid...

490
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:24,423
...picks out a fine house
and goes right through the back door.

491
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,133
Robs you blind.

492
00:49:28,094 --> 00:49:31,389
It takes a lot of sand
to be a turtledove.

493
00:49:53,494 --> 00:49:57,456
I'll have my medal back. Oh, Jesus!

494
00:50:04,046 --> 00:50:06,048
Don't do that again.

495
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:09,051
Listen! I said, don't do that...

496
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:11,846
Go back to the Points
and leave me to my business...

497
00:50:12,013 --> 00:50:14,974
...or I will open your throat,
so help me God.

498
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:20,271
All right.

499
00:50:21,856 --> 00:50:23,816
Go on then.

500
00:50:26,027 --> 00:50:27,945
I would.

501
00:50:29,488 --> 00:50:30,865
Go on then.

502
00:50:53,179 --> 00:50:55,848
Now give me back my medal.

503
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:58,476
Make it quick!

504
00:51:05,608 --> 00:51:08,569
I don't know which one's yours.

505
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:17,536
Suppose I help myself to everything?

506
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:22,083
Suppose you do.

507
00:52:01,247 --> 00:52:04,041
May I walk with you a little then?

508
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:15,302
What do you suppose a fellow
could earn here in a day?

509
00:52:15,636 --> 00:52:18,806
- Maybe we could pal in together.
- Oh, I think you're a bit...

510
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:23,602
...rough for this sort of game.
Besides, I work alone.

511
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:26,689
Alone? Well, what do you quarter
to the Butcher?

512
00:52:26,856 --> 00:52:29,150
- Me? Nothing.
- Nothing?

513
00:52:29,317 --> 00:52:31,819
The Butcher and me
have a special arrangement.

514
00:52:39,285 --> 00:52:43,122
- I don't want to see you again.
- Well, I don't blame you.

515
00:52:43,956 --> 00:52:46,667
Pennies in their pockets
and hope in their eyes...

516
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:48,919
...they peer to the west...

517
00:52:49,086 --> 00:52:53,674
...searching the horizon
for a glimpse of land and salvation.

518
00:52:55,468 --> 00:52:57,053
A glimpse of America.

519
00:52:57,219 --> 00:53:00,556
Seeing all this poverty must be
most unsettling, Miss Schermerhorn.

520
00:53:00,723 --> 00:53:04,352
Some days, of course,
the uptown gangs come down to us.

521
00:53:04,935 --> 00:53:08,606
The Schermerhorns was one
of the oldest families in New York.

522
00:53:08,773 --> 00:53:10,358
They didn 't run the city...

523
00:53:10,524 --> 00:53:12,943
...but they was listened
to carefully by them that did.

524
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,904
Commissioner Brunt
said you wished to view...

525
00:53:15,071 --> 00:53:17,448
...the Points in all
its splendor and squalor.

526
00:53:17,615 --> 00:53:19,867
"Spare nothing concerning
the conditions," said he.

527
00:53:20,034 --> 00:53:22,953
Yeah, nothing except
our safety, constable.

528
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,707
I'm sure we can be in no danger
while we're in the constable's company.

529
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:30,461
Quite so, madam. Witness.

530
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:40,721
- Shall we continue on?
- What, you dare to leave it there?

531
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:45,476
Safe as a bank, Mr. Greeley,
since all know it's mine.

532
00:53:45,643 --> 00:53:50,898
- Is that man drunk?
- Dead as Good friday, miss.

533
00:53:55,152 --> 00:53:57,530
- Good day to you, Mulraney.
- Boys.

534
00:53:57,697 --> 00:53:59,407
- Jack.
- Slum sociable?

535
00:53:59,573 --> 00:54:02,076
Fact-finding. Reforms-studying.

536
00:54:02,243 --> 00:54:04,704
- May I present...?
- The Schermerhorns of fifth Avenue...

537
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:07,081
...scarcely require
an introduction from you.

538
00:54:07,248 --> 00:54:10,584
Schermerhorn, indeed. Their daughter.
This gentleman, of course...

539
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:14,005
Horace Greeley, the famous publisher.
A pleasure and an honor.

540
00:54:14,422 --> 00:54:17,216
- Of the Tribune.
- I'm William Cutting.

541
00:54:18,592 --> 00:54:20,928
How do you do, Mr. Cutting?

542
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:26,600
As of this moment, extremely well,
thank you. How do you do?

543
00:54:27,101 --> 00:54:29,145
Orange blossom. Delicious.

544
00:54:29,312 --> 00:54:31,605
- Mr. Cutting is...
- What a peach.

545
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:33,774
She could have a fine career
on the stage.

546
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:36,527
...one of Five Points' local...
- A pleasure to meet you.

547
00:54:36,694 --> 00:54:38,237
...leaders.
- Mr. Greeley.

548
00:54:38,404 --> 00:54:40,448
- Pleased to meet you.
- The Points welcomes you.

549
00:54:40,614 --> 00:54:43,576
You are welcome to these streets
and will pass in safety.

550
00:54:44,702 --> 00:54:49,457
Oh, I'll see to their safety.
Thank you, Bill. There we are.

551
00:54:49,623 --> 00:54:53,044
Good day, lads.
Criminal's braggadocio, you see.

552
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:57,465
- He knows who I am.
- You're well-known in these parts.

553
00:54:57,798 --> 00:55:01,052
I must say that I find
that strangely flattering.

554
00:55:01,218 --> 00:55:03,929
- I never did like crushers.
- Well, draw it mild, son.

555
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:08,642
Happy Jack don't fill his lungs
without I tell him he may do so.

556
00:55:21,197 --> 00:55:25,159
Do you think my watch
would be safe up on that lamppost, Bill?

557
00:55:26,494 --> 00:55:28,913
Why don't you hang it up there and see?

558
00:55:31,749 --> 00:55:32,917
Someday.

559
00:55:34,752 --> 00:55:36,253
Someday is right.

560
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:40,091
This a new lad?

561
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:46,055
Just another bastard son of Erin
I folded in the warmth of my embrace.

562
00:55:48,933 --> 00:55:51,560
- Hey!
- I just want to see your face, son.

563
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:53,896
No harm intended.

564
00:56:17,003 --> 00:56:20,131
You get to know a lot butchering meat.

565
00:56:21,424 --> 00:56:23,968
We're made up of the same things:
Flesh and blood...

566
00:56:24,135 --> 00:56:27,430
...tissue, organs.

567
00:56:27,596 --> 00:56:30,307
I love to work with pigs.

568
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:35,771
The nearest thing in nature to the flesh
of a man is the flesh of a pig.

569
00:56:35,938 --> 00:56:38,107
- Pig, huh?
- That's right.

570
00:56:38,274 --> 00:56:40,818
This is for you, mother.

571
00:56:43,321 --> 00:56:44,655
There you go.

572
00:56:44,822 --> 00:56:47,867
- God bless you, Mr. Cutting.
- God bless you.

573
00:56:48,034 --> 00:56:52,496
- She ain't really my mother.
- I knew that, Bill.

574
00:56:56,584 --> 00:56:58,919
This is the liver.

575
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,213
The kidneys.

576
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,215
The heart.

577
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:06,761
This is a wound.
The stomach will bleed and bleed.

578
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:10,264
This is a kill. This is a kill.

579
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:14,518
The main artery. This is a kill.

580
00:57:15,895 --> 00:57:17,855
You try.

581
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,360
Go ahead.

582
00:57:48,177 --> 00:57:50,680
The lung. Good.
Don't foul the blade on the rib.

583
00:57:50,846 --> 00:57:53,015
Very good. Main artery.

584
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:55,977
Bleed him slow.
Let him think about it for a while.

585
00:57:56,143 --> 00:57:58,980
Slow death. Good.

586
00:58:00,398 --> 00:58:03,734
You'll each bill the city $5000
a month for supplies and services...

587
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:05,695
...of which you'll receive 10%.

588
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:09,699
Bill! Mr. Killoran will work out
the details. Thank you, gentlemen.

589
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:12,910
That's how we do things
around Tammany, gentlemen.

590
00:58:13,077 --> 00:58:14,996
Who's this then?

591
00:58:15,997 --> 00:58:17,915
Thank you, boys.

592
00:58:18,082 --> 00:58:20,167
Good day, sir.

593
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:34,306
You got something on your mind?

594
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:39,145
Bill's taken quite a liking to you.

595
00:58:41,856 --> 00:58:45,651
Now, if you're up to something, bene.

596
00:58:45,818 --> 00:58:48,029
Only I don't want no part in it.

597
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:56,203
I was in Hellgate for 16 years.

598
00:58:56,579 --> 00:58:58,956
I'm just trying to make my way is all.

599
00:58:59,123 --> 00:59:01,334
Just like you.

600
00:59:02,376 --> 00:59:04,545
Unless, of course,
you got a better notion?

601
00:59:06,047 --> 00:59:07,173
No.

602
00:59:08,132 --> 00:59:12,219
Bill, I can't get a day's work done
for all the good citizens...

603
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:15,890
...coming in here to harass me
about crime in the Points.

604
00:59:16,057 --> 00:59:18,517
Some even go so far
as to accuse Tammany...

605
00:59:18,684 --> 00:59:22,438
...of connivance in this so-called
rampant criminality.

606
00:59:22,605 --> 00:59:25,733
What am I to do? I can't have this.
Something has to be done.

607
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,277
- What do you have in mind?
- I don't know.

608
00:59:28,444 --> 00:59:30,738
I think maybe we should
hang someone.

609
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:34,116
- Who?
- No one important, necessarily.

610
00:59:34,283 --> 00:59:38,871
Average men will do.
Back-alley amusers with no affiliations.

611
00:59:39,038 --> 00:59:42,750
- How many?
- Three or four.

612
00:59:43,084 --> 00:59:46,629
- Which?
- Four.

613
00:59:47,213 --> 00:59:50,800
You stand here convicted varyingly...

614
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:54,095
...of lewdness, jack-rolling...

615
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:58,015
...sneak-thievery,
chloral-hydrating...

616
00:59:58,182 --> 01:00:00,893
...sodomy, strangulation...

617
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:05,982
...and enthusiastic corruption
of the public good.

618
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:09,360
- We all go someday, huh?
- Chin up.

619
01:00:09,527 --> 01:00:11,737
Handsome bunch of gallows fruit.
There's my old friend.

620
01:00:11,904 --> 01:00:14,865
- How are you feeling, Arthur?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

621
01:00:15,032 --> 01:00:18,077
Say hello to Amsterdam. Nearly
fishhooked McGloin the other day.

622
01:00:18,244 --> 01:00:19,412
- How do you do?
- Nearly.

623
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:21,288
See you dressed for the occasion.

624
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:23,624
You know me,
always like to look me best.

625
01:00:23,791 --> 01:00:25,292
That's the spirit.

626
01:00:26,794 --> 01:00:29,714
Nice locket.
I'll give you a dollar for it.

627
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,549
Lt's me mother's.

628
01:00:31,716 --> 01:00:33,134
Dollar and a half?

629
01:00:34,093 --> 01:00:35,428
Done.

630
01:00:38,973 --> 01:00:40,474
We'll miss you, Arthur.

631
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:42,810
- See you in the hot country, Seamus.
- Hot corn!

632
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:46,147
Ears of early white corn!
Hot corn!

633
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:52,320
Is my son present here?

634
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:55,656
Where's my little fella?

635
01:00:57,825 --> 01:00:59,618
Look at your dad.

636
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:01,829
Farewell, dear boy.

637
01:01:03,247 --> 01:01:08,127
I never struck a foul blow,
nor turned a card.

638
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:13,174
May God greet me as a friend.

639
01:01:37,198 --> 01:01:40,701
And grace my fears relieved

640
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:44,872
How precious
Did that grace appear

641
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:47,875
That night,
the reformers held a dance.

642
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:50,544
That was the Five Points, all right.

643
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:54,006
Hangings of a morning,
dancings of an evening.

644
01:01:54,173 --> 01:01:56,092
- Sure meself, but...

645
01:01:56,258 --> 01:01:59,095
...it's not a matter of words.
I can tell by the way she smiles at me.

646
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:01,222
- She smiles at a lot of people.
- Sir.

647
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:02,682
You don't know her.

648
01:02:02,848 --> 01:02:06,394
A penny of gratitude
for a fighting Irishman, young sir.

649
01:02:09,605 --> 01:02:12,984
- You from Kerry?
- I am, sir. I am.

650
01:02:13,943 --> 01:02:16,570
- It ain't much.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

651
01:02:16,737 --> 01:02:19,323
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are delighted to see...

652
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:22,952
...so many young faces
at our first annual Mission dance.

653
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:24,996
This'll be a real ballum rancum, eh?

654
01:02:25,162 --> 01:02:28,207
The Mission welcomes Christians
of every stamp...

655
01:02:28,374 --> 01:02:31,961
...and we are particularly happy
to greet our Roman Catholic friends...

656
01:02:32,128 --> 01:02:34,088
...who join us here tonight.

657
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:38,134
- Ladies! Come with me. Come with me.
- Shall we dance?

658
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:41,137
We're going to start the dancing
in just a moment.

659
01:02:41,303 --> 01:02:42,346
No.

660
01:02:43,097 --> 01:02:46,934
- Good evening, Reverend.
- Good evening, Your Holiness.

661
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,229
Good evening, Reverend.

662
01:02:50,563 --> 01:02:53,482
Looks as though
you should have shaved closer.

663
01:02:57,278 --> 01:03:00,614
Good evening, Reverend.
I do beg your pardon.

664
01:03:04,952 --> 01:03:06,787
Miss...?

665
01:03:10,624 --> 01:03:13,878
- Everdeane.
- Miss Everdeane.

666
01:03:26,015 --> 01:03:30,978
Now, gentlemen, over here,
if you don't mind. Thank you.

667
01:03:31,145 --> 01:03:33,981
Open it. Hold it up.

668
01:03:36,192 --> 01:03:38,152
Into the mirror.

669
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:32,331
That one.

670
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,336
Our queen has chosen.

671
01:04:55,896 --> 01:04:57,440
Sir...

672
01:04:57,606 --> 01:05:00,067
...your lady.
- Right.

673
01:05:00,234 --> 01:05:03,154
Regular services are held
at the church at 6 and 8.

674
01:05:03,321 --> 01:05:04,405
Go to hell.

675
01:05:13,831 --> 01:05:16,000
- What do you think you're doing?
- Dancing.

676
01:05:16,167 --> 01:05:19,420
- I said, why'd you pick me?
- That's none of your business.

677
01:05:19,587 --> 01:05:21,464
Would you mind telling me?

678
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:23,591
I'm sorry.

679
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:26,635
Goddamn it!

680
01:05:27,219 --> 01:05:30,931
I'm sorry.
I'm not much of a dancer.

681
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:32,933
Just try to keep calm.

682
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:37,355
- I never been to a stepping-ken before.
- Lt's best not to look down.

683
01:05:39,482 --> 01:05:42,151
You can hold me tighter if you like.

684
01:05:49,659 --> 01:05:51,619
- All right?
- Aye.

685
01:05:53,454 --> 01:05:56,290
So why didn't you dance with Johnny?

686
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:59,251
Because...

687
01:06:01,837 --> 01:06:04,006
...I didn't want him.

688
01:07:02,273 --> 01:07:04,567
I'm not wanting this.

689
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:12,825
- Wait.
- What?

690
01:07:12,992 --> 01:07:14,535
Wait.

691
01:07:15,411 --> 01:07:16,620
How does this open?

692
01:07:16,787 --> 01:07:20,791
It takes too long to lace back up.
We'll be here all night.

693
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:35,139
Sure, all right, I'll take it off.

694
01:07:56,619 --> 01:07:59,455
There was a baby.
They cut it out.

695
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:05,670
I'm sorry.

696
01:08:06,754 --> 01:08:08,798
Oh, it's fine.

697
01:08:12,593 --> 01:08:15,054
Have you got any scars?

698
01:08:16,555 --> 01:08:18,349
One or two.

699
01:09:16,532 --> 01:09:18,492
What's that, then?

700
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:20,036
That?

701
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:22,663
Lt's a gift from Mr. Cutting.

702
01:09:27,001 --> 01:09:28,753
A gift?

703
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,297
A gift.

704
01:09:32,465 --> 01:09:34,008
Was it your birthday?

705
01:09:35,343 --> 01:09:37,011
No.

706
01:09:41,182 --> 01:09:43,559
What'd you give him, then?

707
01:09:45,686 --> 01:09:48,522
The answer to that
has nothing to do with you.

708
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:57,823
- Don't tell me you're angry with me.
- No.

709
01:09:58,366 --> 01:10:00,534
I'm through with you.

710
01:10:04,538 --> 01:10:07,249
Well, you're quicker
than most fellows.

711
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:09,710
Generally, they wait till afterwards.

712
01:10:09,877 --> 01:10:12,880
I ain't interested
in the Butcher's leavings.

713
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:35,152
Hey! Bill says
keep clear of the pikers.

714
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:38,239
- Fifteen to one, Bug-Eye Moran.
- Amsterdam!

715
01:10:39,073 --> 01:10:41,409
Everyone was working
for the Butcher.

716
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:43,411
We ran his errands,
made his money...

717
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:45,579
...took a piece and said,
"Thank you, sir."

718
01:10:45,746 --> 01:10:48,332
- Gentlemen, it's a raid!
- Even Tweed.

719
01:10:48,499 --> 01:10:50,918
- The fight's over.
- Even me.

720
01:10:51,085 --> 01:10:53,754
- All right, you stupid...
- My father's son.

721
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:56,382
- What the hell is this?
- Sorry, Bill.

722
01:10:56,549 --> 01:11:00,386
The city ordinance against boxiana's
a blight, I grant you, but some...

723
01:11:00,553 --> 01:11:03,556
I'm losing revenue while you speechify.
Collect those bets!

724
01:11:03,723 --> 01:11:05,766
How do I collect
if no one won the fight?

725
01:11:05,933 --> 01:11:08,769
This counts as a "no decision."
You got that covered, right?

726
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:10,855
Didn't anybody pay off the police?

727
01:11:11,022 --> 01:11:13,691
We paid the Municipal Police.
This is Metropolitan.

728
01:11:13,858 --> 01:11:15,901
- You'll repay me every cent.
- Mr. Tweed...

729
01:11:16,068 --> 01:11:18,279
- Who asked for your opinion?
- Let him speak!

730
01:11:18,446 --> 01:11:19,780
He don't answer to you.

731
01:11:20,072 --> 01:11:22,616
The law says there's no boxing
in the city, right?

732
01:11:22,783 --> 01:11:26,078
- That's right. In the city.
- Well, where does the city end?

733
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:37,298
The winner, in the 75th round...

734
01:11:37,465 --> 01:11:42,386
Allow me to acknowledge the man whose
vision and enterprise made possible...

735
01:11:42,553 --> 01:11:45,389
...the staging of this noble combat...

736
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:49,560
...in these awe-inspiring
and entirely legal surroundings:

737
01:11:49,727 --> 01:11:52,730
Mr. William Cutting!

738
01:11:55,232 --> 01:11:59,612
And... And his young associate!

739
01:11:59,987 --> 01:12:01,697
That's you, boy.

740
01:12:03,658 --> 01:12:05,493
Come on, get in there.
Come on, son.

741
01:12:08,204 --> 01:12:10,748
You done very good.
How do you like them apples?

742
01:12:10,915 --> 01:12:12,750
We done good.
We done all right.

743
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:15,961
- While I have your attention...
- It was a good show.

744
01:12:16,128 --> 01:12:18,506
...may I remind you of the wonders
that await you...

745
01:12:18,673 --> 01:12:22,635
...at my muzeum located on Broadway!

746
01:12:22,802 --> 01:12:26,180
P.T. Barnum's Gallery of Wonders!

747
01:12:28,474 --> 01:12:32,520
- That's my money!
- Get your hands out of me pockets!

748
01:12:35,106 --> 01:12:39,193
Lt's a funny feeling being took
under the wing of a dragon.

749
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:41,946
Lt's warmer than you think.

750
01:12:42,822 --> 01:12:45,866
That's the building of our country
right there, Mr. Cutting.

751
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:47,910
Americans aborning.

752
01:12:48,077 --> 01:12:51,747
I don't see no Americans.
I see trespassers.

753
01:12:51,914 --> 01:12:55,543
Irish harps will do a job for a nickel
what a nigger does for a dime...

754
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:57,670
...and a white man used to get
a quarter for.

755
01:12:57,837 --> 01:13:00,214
What have they done?
Name one thing they've contributed.

756
01:13:00,381 --> 01:13:02,800
- Votes.
- Votes, you say?

757
01:13:02,967 --> 01:13:06,053
They vote how the archbishop
tells them. And who tells him?

758
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:10,474
Their king in the pointy hat
what sits on his throne in Rome.

759
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:13,686
Bill's got mixed feelings
as regards the Irish.

760
01:13:14,687 --> 01:13:18,899
Deliver these good and fervent folk
to the polls on a regular basis...

761
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:23,571
...and there'll be a handsome price
for each vote goes Tammany's way.

762
01:13:26,032 --> 01:13:29,994
My father gave his life
making this country what it is.

763
01:13:30,161 --> 01:13:35,416
Murdered by the British with all his men
on the 25th of July, anno Domini 1814.

764
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:38,377
You think I'm gonna help you
befoul his legacy...

765
01:13:38,544 --> 01:13:42,173
...by giving this country over to them
what's had no hand in fighting for it?

766
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:46,344
Why? Because they come off a boat,
crawling with lice and begging for soup?

767
01:13:47,178 --> 01:13:51,265
You're a great one for the fighting,
I know, but you can't fight forever.

768
01:13:51,432 --> 01:13:54,685
- I can go down doing it.
- And you will.

769
01:13:58,189 --> 01:14:00,191
What did you say?

770
01:14:00,358 --> 01:14:03,527
I said, you're turning your back
on the future.

771
01:14:05,738 --> 01:14:07,948
Not our future.

772
01:14:13,329 --> 01:14:17,291
That document makes you a citizen. This
makes you a private in the Union Army.

773
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:19,293
Now go fight for your country.

774
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:21,170
Next.

775
01:14:21,545 --> 01:14:24,465
Sign here, son.
Or make your mark.

776
01:14:24,632 --> 01:14:26,967
You're in the Army now.
Three square meals a day.

777
01:14:27,134 --> 01:14:30,304
Uniforms first, then weapons.

778
01:14:31,055 --> 01:14:33,933
- I haven't eaten in two days.
- Keep moving, men.

779
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:45,277
There's your musket.
Keep it dry on the boat.

780
01:14:45,444 --> 01:14:47,863
- Same for this cartridge case.
- Where are we going?

781
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:49,782
- I heard Tennessee.
- Where's that?

782
01:15:03,337 --> 01:15:06,340
Do they feed us now, do you think?

783
01:15:15,683 --> 01:15:20,271
My children! My children!

784
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:24,775
We must heal the divisions
between us.

785
01:15:24,942 --> 01:15:26,027
This war must cease.

786
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:32,199
North and South must stand united!

787
01:15:36,746 --> 01:15:40,041
You're a liar! Rubbish!

788
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:46,380
- What happens at the finish, then?
- Then we have ourselves a rowdy-dow.

789
01:15:46,797 --> 01:15:50,301
- Ain't you been to the theater before?
- No.

790
01:15:50,468 --> 01:15:54,555
Mr. Legree, lay down your whip.

791
01:15:54,722 --> 01:15:58,559
Miss Eliza,
join hands with Mr. Shelby.

792
01:15:58,726 --> 01:16:05,149
And, Topsy, dear little Topsy,
cradle Uncle Tom's head.

793
01:16:05,733 --> 01:16:07,735
Leave the nigger dead!

794
01:16:17,745 --> 01:16:18,871
Get me down!

795
01:16:19,038 --> 01:16:22,083
Down with the Union!

796
01:16:22,249 --> 01:16:23,918
Down with the Union!

797
01:16:24,085 --> 01:16:25,753
Down with the Union!

798
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,089
- Down with the Union!
- Down with the Union!

799
01:16:46,357 --> 01:16:48,776
- For the blood of the Irish!
- Bill, get down!

800
01:16:57,952 --> 01:17:00,788
Somebody's popped the Butcher!

801
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:14,802
Stifle that rat bastard down!

802
01:17:21,142 --> 01:17:23,811
God, forgive me.

803
01:17:41,495 --> 01:17:43,122
Whose man are you?

804
01:17:43,289 --> 01:17:45,833
Speak smart and speak up.

805
01:17:46,834 --> 01:17:48,294
What's he saying, boy?

806
01:17:50,546 --> 01:17:52,590
I think he's making his peace
with God.

807
01:17:52,757 --> 01:17:54,967
The hell with that.
He makes peace with me.

808
01:17:55,134 --> 01:17:58,763
I'm hearing confession tonight,
you mother-whoring Irish nigger!

809
01:17:58,929 --> 01:18:01,599
Whose man are you?
We speak English in this country.

810
01:18:01,766 --> 01:18:03,517
Whose man are you?
See this knife?

811
01:18:03,684 --> 01:18:06,771
I'm gonna teach you to speak English
with this fucking knife!

812
01:18:06,937 --> 01:18:08,481
Whose man are you?

813
01:18:08,648 --> 01:18:10,900
Whose man are you?

814
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:29,377
Well, that didn't tell us very much.

815
01:18:31,921 --> 01:18:34,090
Fine waistcoat.

816
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:38,219
Shame about it.
I don't think it can be mended.

817
01:18:38,636 --> 01:18:41,973
Will I keep it as a souvenir?

818
01:19:15,339 --> 01:19:18,175
Where's Legree? Where's Mopsy?

819
01:19:18,342 --> 01:19:23,097
Tragedians, let's continue.
Intermission is over!

820
01:19:40,406 --> 01:19:43,242
Now that was bloody Shakespearean.

821
01:19:43,409 --> 01:19:46,954
- What?
- Do you know who Shakespeare was?

822
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:50,041
He was the fellow who wrote
the King James Bible.

823
01:19:50,207 --> 01:19:52,460
I don't know what you're talking about.

824
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:55,588
That's because you're a thick,
ignorant, barbarous Irish whelp.

825
01:19:55,755 --> 01:19:57,548
Just like your father.

826
01:20:01,844 --> 01:20:03,137
That's it.

827
01:20:03,304 --> 01:20:07,725
Tear my head off and destruct the world,
just like the rest of the stupid Irish.

828
01:20:07,892 --> 01:20:13,314
- That's why I never ran with your dad.
- Get off me, you crazy bastard!

829
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:19,820
It means, if you're not strong,
you'd better be smart.

830
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:22,782
I don't know if you're being
too clever or too dumb.

831
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:25,076
Whichever it is,
just remember this much.

832
01:20:25,242 --> 01:20:30,498
For all his faults, your father
was a man who loved his people.

833
01:20:36,671 --> 01:20:39,423
Amsterdam! Amsterdam!

834
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:42,259
New York is calling you.

835
01:20:53,771 --> 01:20:57,942
Look at that.
What in Christ's name is that?

836
01:20:58,609 --> 01:21:04,073
Rhythms of the Dark Continent thrown
into the kettle with an Irish shindig.

837
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:09,161
Stir it around a few times, pull it out,
it's a fine American mess.

838
01:21:09,537 --> 01:21:12,039
A jig doing a jig.

839
01:21:13,082 --> 01:21:15,042
A little keepsake.

840
01:21:18,337 --> 01:21:20,715
- Good on you, sir.
- Come upstairs with me, Bill.

841
01:21:22,675 --> 01:21:25,261
Have I ever had you before?

842
01:21:26,721 --> 01:21:29,223
So you don't call me
by my Christian name.

843
01:21:30,683 --> 01:21:32,893
Bill! Thank God you're all right.

844
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,271
I heard the news
and came as quick as I could.

845
01:21:35,438 --> 01:21:37,606
You're as timely as the Angel of Death.

846
01:21:37,773 --> 01:21:42,403
Bill, you're not suggesting that I would
stoop to what you're suggesting?

847
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:46,240
Stop slabbering. If I thought it was you,
you'd be in a wooden coat.

848
01:21:46,407 --> 01:21:49,744
The hole in my shoulder hurts,
so have a drink and shut up.

849
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:52,246
Or shut up and get out.

850
01:21:52,621 --> 01:21:54,165
I believe I'll have a drink.

851
01:21:54,332 --> 01:21:56,417
Careful, Tweedy,
the mort's frenchified.

852
01:21:57,626 --> 01:22:01,088
No, no, I'm clean.
Come on, let's go to the bar.

853
01:22:13,934 --> 01:22:15,853
- Jenny.
- Bill.

854
01:22:40,127 --> 01:22:42,213
Lt's gotta be tight.

855
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:44,465
She loves to make me cry.

856
01:22:45,341 --> 01:22:46,801
You can take it.

857
01:22:55,935 --> 01:22:57,979
There's my boy.

858
01:23:03,985 --> 01:23:05,569
Lt's all right.

859
01:23:11,242 --> 01:23:13,244
To the Butcher.

860
01:23:17,707 --> 01:23:19,959
We're all much obliged.

861
01:23:21,544 --> 01:23:22,837
Forever.

862
01:23:23,004 --> 01:23:25,840
- Bill the Butcher.
- To the Butcher.

863
01:23:35,057 --> 01:23:37,101
Why don't you get out of here, Johnny?

864
01:23:40,354 --> 01:23:41,522
Go on. Go.

865
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:02,168
Is there anyone in the Five Points
you haven't fucked?

866
01:24:02,335 --> 01:24:03,794
You!

867
01:24:14,263 --> 01:24:16,349
Calm down!

868
01:24:27,568 --> 01:24:29,695
Try it and I'll bite you!

869
01:24:29,862 --> 01:24:33,407
If you were gonna bite me,
I don't think you'd warn me, huh?

870
01:24:33,574 --> 01:24:35,368
Find out.

871
01:25:53,529 --> 01:25:55,156
I can't sleep.

872
01:26:01,370 --> 01:26:05,499
I hope you don't mind us
laying out tonight here, sir.

873
01:26:06,334 --> 01:26:09,253
Whatever takes your fancy,
my young friend.

874
01:26:17,678 --> 01:26:22,183
Is it your shoulder
that's keeping you up?

875
01:26:22,350 --> 01:26:25,102
No, I don't never sleep too much.

876
01:26:25,478 --> 01:26:29,857
I have to sleep with one eye open.
I only got one eye, right?

877
01:26:34,528 --> 01:26:37,365
How old are you, Amsterdam?

878
01:26:42,119 --> 01:26:44,455
I'm not too sure.

879
01:26:44,622 --> 01:26:46,374
I never did figure it.

880
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:49,919
I'm 47.

881
01:26:51,837 --> 01:26:54,215
Forty-seven years old.

882
01:26:57,969 --> 01:27:01,639
You know how I stayed alive this long?
All these years?

883
01:27:04,225 --> 01:27:06,227
Fear.

884
01:27:07,895 --> 01:27:10,898
The spectacle of fearsome acts.

885
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:15,069
Somebody steals from me,
I cut off his hands.

886
01:27:15,236 --> 01:27:18,364
He offends me,
I cut out his tongue.

887
01:27:18,531 --> 01:27:24,036
He rises against me,
I cut off his head, stick it on a pike...

888
01:27:24,203 --> 01:27:28,249
...and raise it high up
so all in the streets can see.

889
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:32,753
That's what preserves
the order of things.

890
01:27:36,299 --> 01:27:38,009
Fear.

891
01:27:40,636 --> 01:27:42,430
That one tonight...

892
01:27:42,596 --> 01:27:44,724
...who was he?

893
01:27:46,309 --> 01:27:48,311
A nobody.

894
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:51,272
A coward.

895
01:27:52,898 --> 01:27:56,902
What an ignominious end
that would have been.

896
01:27:59,905 --> 01:28:05,244
I killed the last honorable man
15 years ago. Since then, it's...

897
01:28:07,455 --> 01:28:10,458
You've seen his portrait downstairs?

898
01:28:13,794 --> 01:28:17,131
Is your mouth glued up with
cunny juice? I asked you a question!

899
01:28:17,298 --> 01:28:19,592
I said, I seen it, sir.

900
01:28:24,847 --> 01:28:27,975
Oh, you got a murderous rage
in you, and I like it.

901
01:28:28,142 --> 01:28:32,313
Lt's life boiling up inside of you.
Lt's good.

902
01:28:35,858 --> 01:28:40,321
The Priest and me,
we lived by the same principles.

903
01:28:42,657 --> 01:28:45,785
It was only faith divided us.

904
01:28:48,162 --> 01:28:49,955
He give me this, you know.

905
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:59,006
That was the finest beating
I ever took.

906
01:28:59,632 --> 01:29:01,175
My face was pulp...

907
01:29:01,342 --> 01:29:05,137
...my guts was pierced
and my ribs was all mashed up.

908
01:29:09,684 --> 01:29:12,478
And when he came to finish me...

909
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:19,235
...I couldn't look him in the eye.

910
01:29:25,157 --> 01:29:30,037
He spared me because
he wanted me to live in shame.

911
01:29:30,204 --> 01:29:32,707
This was a great man.

912
01:29:35,376 --> 01:29:37,420
A great man.

913
01:29:40,339 --> 01:29:43,551
So I cut out the eye that looked away.

914
01:29:46,387 --> 01:29:48,889
Sent it to him, wrapped in blue paper.

915
01:29:49,807 --> 01:29:53,561
I would have cut them both out
if I could have fought him blind.

916
01:29:55,563 --> 01:29:58,649
Then I rose back up again
with a full heart...

917
01:29:58,816 --> 01:30:01,652
...and buried him in his own blood.

918
01:30:10,661 --> 01:30:12,663
Well done.

919
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:19,170
He was the only man I ever killed
worth remembering.

920
01:30:30,765 --> 01:30:33,309
I never had a son.

921
01:30:41,484 --> 01:30:44,403
Civilization is crumbling.

922
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:04,966
God bless you.

923
01:31:35,788 --> 01:31:38,541
If you got anything to say...

924
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:41,877
...now is the time to say it.

925
01:31:42,044 --> 01:31:44,255
Who is he to you, Jenny?

926
01:31:50,469 --> 01:31:53,055
I was 12 years old.

927
01:31:53,222 --> 01:31:56,976
My mother was dead.
I was living in a doorway.

928
01:31:59,312 --> 01:32:03,816
He took me in, took care of me...

929
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:06,736
...in his own way.

930
01:32:11,782 --> 01:32:14,452
After they cut out the baby...

931
01:32:16,996 --> 01:32:20,666
Well, he doesn't fancy girls
that scarred up.

932
01:32:27,506 --> 01:32:32,011
You should know in your own mind...

933
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:37,308
...that he never laid a hand on me
until I asked him to.

934
01:32:59,747 --> 01:33:02,041
Who are you?

935
01:33:02,917 --> 01:33:05,419
Who are you?

936
01:34:22,121 --> 01:34:25,708
Gentlemen. Fine gentlemen,
you are most welcome...

937
01:34:25,875 --> 01:34:29,629
...to this palace of wonder
and enchantment...

938
01:34:29,795 --> 01:34:34,800
...where visions to rival the finest
imaginings of Scheherezade...

939
01:34:34,967 --> 01:34:37,970
...and her tales from
the perfumed nights of Arabia...

940
01:34:38,137 --> 01:34:42,141
...will greet your famished eyes.

941
01:35:00,785 --> 01:35:04,288
What am I bid for this
flaxen-haired Teutonic beauty?

942
01:35:04,789 --> 01:35:10,127
Feast your eyes on the magnificent
plumage of these exotic creatures.

943
01:35:10,294 --> 01:35:13,255
Gentlemen, you've seen
our caged birds.

944
01:35:13,422 --> 01:35:17,635
Well, how'd you like
to make them sing?

945
01:35:17,802 --> 01:35:23,975
Let me see the color of your money,
and they could be singing for you.

946
01:35:29,981 --> 01:35:33,484
May God put the steel of the Holy Spirit
in my spine...

947
01:35:34,777 --> 01:35:38,322
...and the love of the Blessed Virgin
in my heart.

948
01:35:41,283 --> 01:35:43,285
Amen.

949
01:35:47,123 --> 01:35:49,125
Easy now.

950
01:35:49,291 --> 01:35:51,127
What did you say?

951
01:35:51,294 --> 01:35:53,796
He's not who he says he is.

952
01:35:54,672 --> 01:35:56,465
He's not who he says he is?

953
01:35:56,632 --> 01:36:00,678
What am I bid? What am I bid?
What am I bid?

954
01:36:01,053 --> 01:36:04,473
Count your blessings
he considers you a friend.

955
01:36:05,641 --> 01:36:10,813
The only thing he considers, every day
and every night, is how best to kill you.

956
01:36:12,148 --> 01:36:15,985
You got a loose tongue in your head.
You want me to take it out for you?

957
01:36:16,152 --> 01:36:19,405
I'll bury it right up your fundament
where it belongs.

958
01:36:19,572 --> 01:36:21,824
I can read right through you.
You're empty...

959
01:36:21,991 --> 01:36:24,410
His name is Vallon!

960
01:36:25,995 --> 01:36:29,999
Don't do it, Bill. His name's Vallon.

961
01:37:01,530 --> 01:37:04,241
They're curious people,
these Celestials.

962
01:37:04,408 --> 01:37:05,701
Don't trust this guy.

963
01:37:05,868 --> 01:37:07,870
- Know why he wears short sleeves?
- Why?

964
01:37:08,037 --> 01:37:10,373
So everyone can see
he's got nothing stashed.

965
01:37:10,623 --> 01:37:13,751
Jesus, let's hope that never
becomes the fashion.

966
01:37:20,091 --> 01:37:21,926
Johnny.

967
01:37:59,213 --> 01:38:01,007
Get up.

968
01:38:15,730 --> 01:38:20,985
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I may have your kind attention.

969
01:38:21,152 --> 01:38:23,654
As some of you have surely noticed...

970
01:38:23,821 --> 01:38:27,825
...our friend and benefactor
Mr. William Cutting...

971
01:38:27,992 --> 01:38:34,373
...is tonight wearing a waistcoat
of certain distinction.

972
01:38:35,499 --> 01:38:37,126
Might we...

973
01:38:38,794 --> 01:38:42,340
Might we tonight appeal
to him to favor us...

974
01:38:42,506 --> 01:38:46,761
...with another exciting exhibition
of skill...

975
01:38:46,927 --> 01:38:52,266
...courage, daring and drama!

976
01:39:04,528 --> 01:39:09,200
- The Sword of Damascus!
- The Tomahawk!

977
01:39:10,868 --> 01:39:12,536
Bill's going up.

978
01:39:19,543 --> 01:39:21,462
Show us your knives.

979
01:39:21,629 --> 01:39:24,173
Strut your stuff, Billy boy.

980
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:26,717
Sword of Damascus!

981
01:39:40,564 --> 01:39:43,734
- The Spider's Kiss!
- The River of Blood!

982
01:39:43,901 --> 01:39:47,530
- The Morning Glory!
- The Wheel of Death!

983
01:39:47,697 --> 01:39:49,907
- William Tell!
- The Butterfly!

984
01:39:50,241 --> 01:39:52,034
- The Tomahawk!
- The Spider's Kiss!

985
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:54,245
The Butcher's Apprentice!

986
01:39:54,412 --> 01:39:55,788
The Butcher's Apprentice.

987
01:39:55,955 --> 01:39:59,250
- Command performance.
- Command performance.

988
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:01,752
- Command performance.
- Where have you been?

989
01:40:01,919 --> 01:40:04,422
A command performance indeed!

990
01:40:04,588 --> 01:40:06,257
- Get out of here.
- Don't do it.

991
01:40:06,424 --> 01:40:11,053
And for this I must beg the indulgence
of my former assistant...

992
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:13,681
...in matters of impalement.

993
01:40:13,848 --> 01:40:17,268
The Butcher's original apprentice.

994
01:40:18,102 --> 01:40:23,232
What do you say, Jen?
One more time for the sweet souvenir?

995
01:40:23,399 --> 01:40:25,276
Come on.

996
01:40:34,618 --> 01:40:36,746
Don't you do it.

997
01:40:37,413 --> 01:40:39,623
Good girl, Jenny.

998
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:43,628
- Don't be afraid.
- What a woman.

999
01:40:46,255 --> 01:40:48,090
Good evening, Bill.

1000
01:40:48,257 --> 01:40:50,301
She'll be all right.

1001
01:40:53,095 --> 01:40:56,265
- Remember this?
- Of course.

1002
01:41:04,982 --> 01:41:10,154
You may feel more comfortable
without that garment, Miss Everdeane.

1003
01:41:11,322 --> 01:41:14,492
You'll have to filch me a new one, Bill.

1004
01:41:27,797 --> 01:41:30,299
Anything in your pockets tonight?

1005
01:41:30,466 --> 01:41:32,802
Oh, I ain't started working yet.

1006
01:41:35,972 --> 01:41:38,849
What about that locket
that I gave you?

1007
01:41:54,156 --> 01:41:57,535
Apologies, my dear. Pick it up.

1008
01:42:02,373 --> 01:42:04,333
Whoopsie-daisy!

1009
01:42:06,335 --> 01:42:08,838
Now it's good and broke.

1010
01:42:09,839 --> 01:42:12,341
I can't seem to get anything
right tonight.

1011
01:42:20,016 --> 01:42:23,853
You got the sand to give them
a grand finale?

1012
01:42:32,028 --> 01:42:35,281
Maybe when you're aiming
a little straighter.

1013
01:42:42,955 --> 01:42:47,543
Still got some blood in you, Jen?
Enough of this heathen music!

1014
01:42:47,710 --> 01:42:50,880
Get rid of these goddamn monkeys.
Strike up, boys!

1015
01:42:51,047 --> 01:42:56,469
Ready? This is a night for Americans!

1016
01:43:03,476 --> 01:43:05,978
- Jenny!
- Get your hands off me.

1017
01:43:06,145 --> 01:43:09,231
- Go away.
- Get your hands off me!

1018
01:43:12,276 --> 01:43:13,569
Move.

1019
01:43:13,736 --> 01:43:15,821
Amsterdam!

1020
01:44:00,992 --> 01:44:03,202
Hats off!

1021
01:44:09,709 --> 01:44:14,422
We hold in our hearts the memory
of our fallen brothers...

1022
01:44:14,672 --> 01:44:18,175
...whose blood stains the very streets
we walk today.

1023
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:25,516
Also on this night, we pay tribute
to the leader of our enemies...

1024
01:44:27,268 --> 01:44:32,189
...an honorable man
who crossed over bravely...

1025
01:44:32,356 --> 01:44:35,026
...fighting for what he believed in.

1026
01:44:41,198 --> 01:44:45,870
To defeat my enemy,
I extinguish his life...

1027
01:44:46,037 --> 01:44:50,041
...and consume him
as I consume these flames.

1028
01:44:51,459 --> 01:44:53,711
In honor of Priest Vallon.

1029
01:45:02,219 --> 01:45:03,763
That's a wound.

1030
01:45:04,138 --> 01:45:06,474
God!

1031
01:45:13,022 --> 01:45:18,152
I want you all to meet
the son of Priest Vallon.

1032
01:45:18,319 --> 01:45:20,988
I took him under my wing...

1033
01:45:21,155 --> 01:45:22,907
...and see how I'm repaid?

1034
01:45:23,074 --> 01:45:25,242
- You bastard!
- Saves my life one day...

1035
01:45:25,409 --> 01:45:27,995
...so he can kill me the next
like a sneak-thief...

1036
01:45:28,162 --> 01:45:31,165
...instead of fighting like a man.

1037
01:45:31,582 --> 01:45:35,878
A base defiler,
unworthy of a noble name.

1038
01:45:38,255 --> 01:45:40,716
God! Jesus!

1039
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:52,186
All right, that'll do, McGloin.
Splay him out.

1040
01:45:53,312 --> 01:45:58,109
This show ain't for blackies.
You! You get to watch.

1041
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:02,279
Don't you hear, nigger?

1042
01:46:03,698 --> 01:46:07,451
This is fresh meat.
You know what I mean?

1043
01:46:07,618 --> 01:46:10,955
We need to tenderize this meat
a little bit.

1044
01:46:11,122 --> 01:46:14,959
All right, let's kiss good night
to that pretty young face of yours.

1045
01:46:19,588 --> 01:46:20,798
No!

1046
01:46:25,344 --> 01:46:27,305
No!

1047
01:46:28,431 --> 01:46:32,310
What'll it be, then? Rib or chop?
Loin or shank?

1048
01:46:32,476 --> 01:46:34,478
- The liver!
- The spleen!

1049
01:46:34,645 --> 01:46:36,355
- The tongue!
- Kidneys!

1050
01:46:42,653 --> 01:46:44,822
- The lungs!
- The liver!

1051
01:46:44,989 --> 01:46:46,824
- The tongue!
- The kidneys!

1052
01:46:46,991 --> 01:46:49,327
- The stomach!
- The heart! The heart!

1053
01:46:49,493 --> 01:46:51,996
The heart? This boy has no heart.

1054
01:46:52,163 --> 01:46:54,957
- Then kill him!
- Kill him!

1055
01:47:00,171 --> 01:47:04,842
He ain't earned a death.
He ain't earned a death at my hands.

1056
01:47:05,134 --> 01:47:09,639
No. He'll walk amongst you
marked with shame...

1057
01:47:09,805 --> 01:47:15,186
...a freak worthy of Barnum's
Muzeum of Wonders.

1058
01:47:15,353 --> 01:47:18,814
Gos only man spared
by the Butcher.

1059
01:47:18,981 --> 01:47:20,399
No, Bill!

1060
01:47:21,567 --> 01:47:24,570
No! No!

1061
01:47:24,904 --> 01:47:28,407
No! No! No!

1062
01:47:28,574 --> 01:47:32,036
No! No! No!

1063
01:47:58,437 --> 01:48:00,606
Here. Here!

1064
01:48:00,773 --> 01:48:03,234
This way. Come on. Come on!

1065
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,574
I wanna show you something.

1066
01:48:56,454 --> 01:48:59,624
My mother's bones share this grave.

1067
01:49:01,626 --> 01:49:06,297
I've saved 10 cents out of every dollar
I've ever earned since I was 13.

1068
01:49:06,464 --> 01:49:08,591
That's $ 215.

1069
01:49:08,758 --> 01:49:14,555
That's $215 for bludgeting
and the rest.

1070
01:49:17,975 --> 01:49:21,812
This is what I wanted to show you.

1071
01:49:21,979 --> 01:49:24,649
This is where we're gonna go
as soon as you get well.

1072
01:49:25,399 --> 01:49:29,862
San francisco, California.

1073
01:49:32,573 --> 01:49:35,242
You can have anything you want
out there.

1074
01:49:35,409 --> 01:49:41,290
These men are pulling gold right out
of the river with their own hands.

1075
01:49:43,084 --> 01:49:47,421
We're here, and we need to get there.

1076
01:49:48,172 --> 01:49:53,678
We start here, go down around here...

1077
01:49:55,763 --> 01:49:58,391
...to San francisco.

1078
01:49:59,934 --> 01:50:01,978
Shortest way to go.

1079
01:50:02,770 --> 01:50:05,272
Would you go with me?

1080
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:33,634
No need to fire that, miss.
Or even aim it.

1081
01:50:34,135 --> 01:50:37,555
An audience with your mangled friend
is all I want.

1082
01:50:52,987 --> 01:50:55,072
I got 44 notches in my club.

1083
01:50:57,408 --> 01:50:59,327
Do you know what they're for?

1084
01:51:01,495 --> 01:51:04,415
To remind me of what I owe God
when I die.

1085
01:51:11,422 --> 01:51:14,258
My father was killed in battle too.

1086
01:51:14,925 --> 01:51:17,928
In Ireland, in the streets...

1087
01:51:19,597 --> 01:51:22,350
...fighting those who would take
as their privilege...

1088
01:51:22,516 --> 01:51:26,771
...what could only be got and held
by the decimation of a race.

1089
01:51:27,438 --> 01:51:30,775
That war is 1000 years old or more.

1090
01:51:31,442 --> 01:51:34,362
We never expected it to follow us here.

1091
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:38,366
It didn't.

1092
01:51:38,532 --> 01:51:41,202
It was waiting for us when we landed.

1093
01:51:44,872 --> 01:51:49,293
Your father tried to carve out a corner
in this country for his tribe.

1094
01:51:51,087 --> 01:51:53,965
That was him.
That was his Dead Rabbits.

1095
01:51:56,884 --> 01:52:00,471
I often wondered,
if he'd lived a bit longer...

1096
01:52:01,305 --> 01:52:03,975
...would he have wanted a bit more?

1097
01:52:15,319 --> 01:52:18,614
Why'd you rifle through
his pockets then?

1098
01:52:35,673 --> 01:52:38,134
For safekeeping.

1099
01:52:41,012 --> 01:52:43,472
I thought maybe you could do with it.

1100
01:53:05,036 --> 01:53:08,164
The blood stays on the blade.

1101
01:54:24,782 --> 01:54:26,951
That's a sorry-looking pelt.

1102
01:54:31,497 --> 01:54:35,501
And it's been so nice and quiet
for the last three months.

1103
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:41,299
Tell me, this charge,
does it sit uneasy with you?

1104
01:54:42,466 --> 01:54:44,635
No, it's...

1105
01:54:45,511 --> 01:54:48,014
...not uneasy, Bill.

1106
01:54:48,806 --> 01:54:51,350
No, I wouldn't say that.

1107
01:54:53,311 --> 01:54:58,482
But my allegiance is to the law.

1108
01:54:59,525 --> 01:55:02,194
I'm paid to uphold the law.

1109
01:55:18,085 --> 01:55:21,589
What in heaven's name
are you talking about?

1110
01:55:25,676 --> 01:55:28,429
You may have misgivings,
but don't go believing that.

1111
01:55:28,596 --> 01:55:31,265
That way lies damnation.

1112
01:55:34,435 --> 01:55:37,521
I'm in no danger of damnation, Bill.

1113
01:55:48,699 --> 01:55:50,952
Here's the thing.

1114
01:55:52,036 --> 01:55:54,997
I don't give a tuppenny fuck
about your moral conundrum...

1115
01:55:55,164 --> 01:55:58,125
...you meatheaded shit-sack.

1116
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:02,213
That's more or less the thing.

1117
01:56:03,547 --> 01:56:06,717
And I want you to go out there...
You, nobody else.

1118
01:56:06,884 --> 01:56:11,305
None of your little minions.
I want you to go out there...

1119
01:56:11,472 --> 01:56:13,641
...and I want you...

1120
01:56:14,558 --> 01:56:18,479
...to punish the person...

1121
01:56:18,646 --> 01:56:21,148
...who's responsible...

1122
01:56:23,234 --> 01:56:27,989
...for murdering
this poor little rabbit.

1123
01:56:33,995 --> 01:56:36,163
Is that understood?

1124
01:56:40,001 --> 01:56:41,752
Right.

1125
01:56:43,004 --> 01:56:46,590
Help yourself to some decent meat
on the way out.

1126
01:57:23,753 --> 01:57:25,588
Damn it.

1127
01:57:27,256 --> 01:57:29,300
Is that you, boy?

1128
01:57:30,301 --> 01:57:32,845
I didn't mean nothing
by that shot, you know.

1129
01:57:34,305 --> 01:57:37,099
You scared me is all.

1130
01:57:39,268 --> 01:57:42,146
Sure you know I'd never do you harm.

1131
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:45,441
Come out now, lad.

1132
01:57:47,652 --> 01:57:50,446
Remember your father and me.

1133
01:57:53,491 --> 01:57:57,286
Are you too young to remember
your old Uncle Jack?

1134
01:57:59,121 --> 01:58:01,791
Oh, the times we had.

1135
01:58:07,338 --> 01:58:09,799
You know I won't hurt you.

1136
01:58:31,404 --> 01:58:33,489
Is he dead?

1137
01:58:33,656 --> 01:58:37,076
I'm gonna get Andrew.
Andrew, come see.

1138
01:58:37,243 --> 01:58:41,497
Andrew, come see, quick!
Everybody, quick!

1139
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:46,335
This is bad for everybody.
What's next? Dead politicians?

1140
01:58:47,253 --> 01:58:52,425
I could spare half a dozen of you
easier than I can spare him.

1141
01:58:53,175 --> 01:58:56,929
Still, I think it shows dash.

1142
01:58:57,096 --> 01:59:01,100
Give the boy some time.
We'll settle with a good dustup.

1143
01:59:44,477 --> 01:59:47,980
There's more of us coming
off these ships every day.

1144
01:59:48,648 --> 01:59:52,318
I heard 15,000 Irish a week.

1145
01:59:53,319 --> 01:59:55,780
And we're afraid of the Natives.

1146
01:59:57,782 --> 02:00:02,286
Get all of us together,
we ain't got a gang. We got an army.

1147
02:00:02,453 --> 02:00:05,122
And all you nees a spark, right?
Just one spark.

1148
02:00:05,289 --> 02:00:07,833
Something to wake us all up.

1149
02:00:24,392 --> 02:00:27,061
It was me played you false.

1150
02:00:28,896 --> 02:00:32,483
- I'd take it back if I could.
- Take it back?

1151
02:00:36,070 --> 02:00:38,656
Johnny, I gotta kill you.

1152
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:55,673
Get out of the Points
and don't come back.

1153
02:01:03,180 --> 02:01:05,599
Where you going, boyo?

1154
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:08,102
Come along.

1155
02:01:08,269 --> 02:01:10,104
Come on.

1156
02:01:12,523 --> 02:01:15,443
Tell us, John, what's the trouble?

1157
02:01:16,277 --> 02:01:18,070
No trouble, Bill.

1158
02:01:21,115 --> 02:01:23,743
Still hiding out with your friends?

1159
02:01:26,871 --> 02:01:31,542
No, I'm... I'm not with them, Bill.

1160
02:01:31,709 --> 02:01:34,837
I'm with you. I'm with the Natives.

1161
02:01:39,383 --> 02:01:43,638
You always was a Native
as far as I'm interested, John...

1162
02:01:45,973 --> 02:01:48,893
...till you became a stag.

1163
02:01:52,313 --> 02:01:55,983
You tell me you're a Native.
Do you want to know what a Native is?

1164
02:01:57,818 --> 02:02:01,322
A Native is a man...

1165
02:02:01,489 --> 02:02:06,202
...what's willing to give his life
for his country...

1166
02:02:08,079 --> 02:02:10,414
...like my father done.

1167
02:02:13,501 --> 02:02:17,505
Are you willing to do that,
my young friend?

1168
02:02:26,430 --> 02:02:29,684
John. Johnny!

1169
02:02:37,191 --> 02:02:39,193
Johnny?

1170
02:02:48,619 --> 02:02:50,621
John...

1171
02:03:02,883 --> 02:03:05,720
It hurts too much.

1172
02:03:11,767 --> 02:03:13,936
Just kill me.

1173
02:03:18,482 --> 02:03:20,943
Just kill me.

1174
02:03:22,486 --> 02:03:25,781
Please, please.

1175
02:03:33,289 --> 02:03:35,333
Please.

1176
02:03:37,585 --> 02:03:39,503
Please.

1177
02:03:43,633 --> 02:03:46,135
I'm sorry, Johnny.

1178
02:04:01,525 --> 02:04:03,986
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

1179
02:04:04,153 --> 02:04:07,657
...now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

1180
02:04:08,366 --> 02:04:10,701
Rest in peace, Ma.

1181
02:04:13,412 --> 02:04:15,831
What're you doing here, boyo?

1182
02:04:22,088 --> 02:04:25,424
What's a nigger doing in this church?

1183
02:04:29,679 --> 02:04:31,931
What's a Dead Rabbit doing
with the Natives?

1184
02:04:32,098 --> 02:04:35,267
There's no niggers in the Natives.
Natives and Rabbits is one thing.

1185
02:04:35,434 --> 02:04:37,436
A nigger in the church
is something else!

1186
02:04:37,603 --> 02:04:39,522
You run with the Natives,
pray with them!

1187
02:04:39,689 --> 02:04:42,817
You're gonna wind up on a stake
like your man did!

1188
02:04:43,567 --> 02:04:44,860
McGloin.

1189
02:04:45,027 --> 02:04:49,448
Father! Jesus, did you know
there's a nigger in your church?

1190
02:05:07,466 --> 02:05:09,969
Jesus.

1191
02:05:32,450 --> 02:05:34,994
The earth turns...

1192
02:05:35,786 --> 02:05:38,497
...but we don 't feel it move.

1193
02:05:41,125 --> 02:05:43,961
Then one night you look up.

1194
02:05:44,962 --> 02:05:50,134
One spark, and the sky is on fire.

1195
02:06:01,354 --> 02:06:04,315
Lt's a touching spectacle.

1196
02:06:06,025 --> 02:06:09,153
We'll come back
when you're ready for us.

1197
02:06:15,409 --> 02:06:19,246
The past is the torch
that lights our way.

1198
02:06:19,497 --> 02:06:24,919
Where our fathers have shown us
the path, we shall follow.

1199
02:06:26,754 --> 02:06:31,092
Our faith is the weapon most feared
by our enemies.

1200
02:06:31,342 --> 02:06:36,263
For thereby shall we lift our people up
against those who would destroy us.

1201
02:06:36,430 --> 02:06:41,352
Our name is called the Dead Rabbits
to remind all of our suffering...

1202
02:06:41,519 --> 02:06:45,398
...and as a call to those who suffer still
to join our ranks...

1203
02:06:45,564 --> 02:06:50,361
...however so far they may have strayed
from our common home across the sea.

1204
02:06:50,528 --> 02:06:54,198
For with great numbers
must come great strength...

1205
02:06:55,950 --> 02:06:58,119
...and the salvation of our people.

1206
02:06:58,619 --> 02:07:00,997
- We don't want your business.
- How many men live here?

1207
02:07:01,163 --> 02:07:03,708
- You have to register.
- You can't force me to join.

1208
02:07:03,874 --> 02:07:05,543
- Have you got $300?
- Of course not.

1209
02:07:05,710 --> 02:07:09,171
- Who's got $300?
- Lf you're drafted, release from service...

1210
02:07:09,338 --> 02:07:12,758
...can only be secured for $300,
according to the Conscription Act.

1211
02:07:12,925 --> 02:07:15,553
- Otherwise, you have to serve!
- Who the hell's got $300?

1212
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:19,390
You have to serve, sir,
unless you have $300!

1213
02:07:19,557 --> 02:07:21,517
- Boys!
- Go back to where you came from!

1214
02:07:21,684 --> 02:07:26,063
I'm born in this country. You immigrated
here. You will fight for this country!

1215
02:07:26,230 --> 02:07:28,899
Sweet Jesus!
War does terrible things to men.

1216
02:07:29,066 --> 02:07:35,072
- Get back uptown where you belong!
- $300? So it's another rich man's war.

1217
02:07:35,239 --> 02:07:38,367
Sir, I request an audience
with this man.

1218
02:07:40,411 --> 02:07:42,580
No one speak English
in New York anymore?

1219
02:07:42,747 --> 02:07:44,874
- Don't understand.
- You do speak English.

1220
02:07:46,792 --> 02:07:51,213
I wonder if Miss Everdeane could
angle her rifle in some other direction.

1221
02:07:56,552 --> 02:08:01,307
I wonder, Mr. Vallon, if you understand
the true value of this sort of publicity.

1222
02:08:05,227 --> 02:08:09,190
The archbishop himself, shoulder to
shoulder with the Irish in the Five Points.

1223
02:08:09,732 --> 02:08:12,902
I'm offering to form an alliance
with you against Bill Cutting...

1224
02:08:13,069 --> 02:08:15,780
...and his slate
of Nativist candidates.

1225
02:08:15,947 --> 02:08:19,951
I'll negotiate a handsome fee for every
Irish vote you send Tammany's way...

1226
02:08:20,117 --> 02:08:22,453
...in the coming elections.

1227
02:08:23,913 --> 02:08:27,083
I need a new friend
in the Five Points, son.

1228
02:08:30,127 --> 02:08:32,588
I'd like that friend to be you.

1229
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:38,511
Now, just a moment, Mr. Tweed.

1230
02:08:38,678 --> 02:08:41,889
Suppose we do
get you those votes.

1231
02:08:44,225 --> 02:08:46,477
Would you back an Irish candidate
of my choosing?

1232
02:08:46,644 --> 02:08:49,647
- I don't think so.
- What if we get you all the Irish votes?

1233
02:08:49,939 --> 02:08:53,651
That will only happen
in the reign of Queen Dick.

1234
02:08:55,653 --> 02:08:57,863
- Beg your pardon?
- It will never happen.

1235
02:08:58,030 --> 02:09:01,492
I might be persuaded to back an
Irish candidate for, say, alderman.

1236
02:09:01,659 --> 02:09:04,453
- Alderman?
- We've already got Irish aldermen.

1237
02:09:04,620 --> 02:09:07,999
- So we have. That's why...
- Well, what's bigger than alderman?

1238
02:09:09,458 --> 02:09:13,254
Sheriff. Sheriff.
All right, Mr. Tweed.

1239
02:09:13,421 --> 02:09:17,383
You back an Irishman for sheriff
of the city and county of New York...

1240
02:09:17,550 --> 02:09:18,926
...and we'll get him elected.

1241
02:09:19,093 --> 02:09:22,471
I love the Irish, but higher than alderman
you shall never climb.

1242
02:09:22,638 --> 02:09:25,141
- Well, why not?
- For one thing, no man living...

1243
02:09:25,308 --> 02:09:27,101
...can consolidate the Irish vote.
- I can.

1244
02:09:27,268 --> 02:09:29,478
And for another,
I mean no effrontery...

1245
02:09:29,645 --> 02:09:33,899
...no one's yet found an Irish candidate
for sheriff worth voting for.

1246
02:09:36,277 --> 02:09:37,653
Monk.

1247
02:09:38,696 --> 02:09:40,031
Here.

1248
02:09:44,535 --> 02:09:47,204
He's to have me looking as sober
as me own grandfather.

1249
02:09:47,371 --> 02:09:51,542
- Another great man, I'm sure.
- A thorough drunken bastard.

1250
02:09:53,544 --> 02:09:55,338
Could I say what I want?

1251
02:09:56,505 --> 02:09:58,841
Well, that's why I wanted you.

1252
02:09:59,008 --> 02:10:01,927
Our elected representatives
are a gang of thieves...

1253
02:10:02,094 --> 02:10:03,846
...who swear to better our lot...

1254
02:10:04,013 --> 02:10:06,891
...while dipping their hands deep
into our pockets.

1255
02:10:07,058 --> 02:10:10,770
I stand shoulder to shoulder with
community leaders like Bill Cutting...

1256
02:10:11,187 --> 02:10:15,066
...against any and all inroads
into our fine democracy.

1257
02:10:15,232 --> 02:10:19,445
I'll see to it that no one takes away what
you've earned by pluck and application.

1258
02:10:19,612 --> 02:10:21,697
- To invading hordes of Hibernians!

1259
02:10:21,864 --> 02:10:25,910
You go to the polls and you put your
mark next to the name Walter McGinn.

1260
02:10:26,077 --> 02:10:30,748
- Against the potato eaters, like them
over there, thieving our jobs!

1261
02:10:30,915 --> 02:10:33,292
Why should so many
Irish die down south...

1262
02:10:33,459 --> 02:10:38,089
...when the first war to win is not down
in Dixie, but right here in these streets?

1263
02:10:39,924 --> 02:10:42,718
And who's the finest street fighter
in the Five Points?

1264
02:10:42,927 --> 02:10:45,096
- Monk!
- That's right.

1265
02:10:45,262 --> 02:10:48,015
Now, let the whole damn city hear it!

1266
02:10:49,433 --> 02:10:51,268
That man was right born for this.

1267
02:10:51,435 --> 02:10:54,480
Well, he's killed 44 men,
laid low a couple hundred more.

1268
02:10:54,647 --> 02:10:56,315
- Is that right?
- That's right.

1269
02:10:56,482 --> 02:10:58,567
I should have run him for mayor.

1270
02:11:00,778 --> 02:11:04,073
All right, line them up.
Lt's election day!

1271
02:11:04,573 --> 02:11:07,910
Not so fast,
you little yellow bastard!

1272
02:11:08,119 --> 02:11:09,954
Come on!

1273
02:11:13,666 --> 02:11:15,668
Come on, you bastard,
we need your vote.

1274
02:11:15,835 --> 02:11:19,255
Bastard? I fought for you, nigger.
I lost an arm for you.

1275
02:11:19,422 --> 02:11:21,257
Well, that's a start.
Now, come on.

1276
02:11:21,424 --> 02:11:23,175
Rise and shine.
Rise and shine.

1277
02:11:23,342 --> 02:11:26,512
In this great country of ours,
even the hop fiends get to vote!

1278
02:11:27,805 --> 02:11:29,640
Less art and more haste, Don.

1279
02:11:29,807 --> 02:11:32,310
- Where are you going?
- I already voted today.

1280
02:11:32,476 --> 02:11:35,479
Cast for Monk and Tammany,
by God. Twice.

1281
02:11:35,646 --> 02:11:39,483
Twice? Only twice? You call that doing
your civic duty? Come with me.

1282
02:11:39,650 --> 02:11:42,278
Oh, no, you don't.
Get back and sit down.

1283
02:11:42,445 --> 02:11:44,530
Here's another one.
Clean him up good.

1284
02:11:44,697 --> 02:11:47,366
Shave their beards and send them back
to vote again.

1285
02:11:47,533 --> 02:11:50,411
All right, boys. Vote Monk, Tammany.
Monk, Tammany!

1286
02:11:50,578 --> 02:11:53,664
So, gentlemen, what our great city
needs is a new courthouse.

1287
02:11:53,831 --> 02:11:56,709
I propose it should be a modest,
economical structure.

1288
02:11:56,876 --> 02:11:58,669
Excuse me one moment.

1289
02:11:58,836 --> 02:12:02,381
Monk's already won by 3000
more votes than there are voters.

1290
02:12:02,548 --> 02:12:06,093
Three? Make it 20, 30. We don't need
a victory. We need a Roman triumph!

1291
02:12:06,260 --> 02:12:10,514
- But we don't have any more ballots.
- Remember the first rule of politics:

1292
02:12:10,681 --> 02:12:14,060
The ballots don't make the results,
the counters make the results.

1293
02:12:14,226 --> 02:12:15,353
Keep counting.

1294
02:12:47,218 --> 02:12:49,220
Lt's from Bill.

1295
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:54,225
Monk.

1296
02:13:13,953 --> 02:13:16,956
Citizens of the Five Points...

1297
02:13:17,456 --> 02:13:21,377
...Mr. Bill Cutting is attempting
to draw me into an argument...

1298
02:13:21,544 --> 02:13:26,132
...that would no doubt end in bloodshed
and the compromising of my office.

1299
02:13:26,799 --> 02:13:28,759
What do you think?

1300
02:13:29,677 --> 02:13:33,347
Should I engage in silence
this relic of the ancient law?

1301
02:13:33,514 --> 02:13:39,937
Or shall I be your chosen voice
in a new testament, in the new world?

1302
02:13:45,901 --> 02:13:47,695
There you are, Bill.

1303
02:13:49,322 --> 02:13:51,324
The people have spoken.

1304
02:13:52,825 --> 02:13:56,912
The very notion of violent reprisal
benumbs them.

1305
02:13:59,165 --> 02:14:00,791
Come on up.

1306
02:14:01,375 --> 02:14:04,795
Let's see if we can resolve
our grievances the democratic way.

1307
02:14:28,069 --> 02:14:32,865
That, my friends,
is the minority vote.

1308
02:14:33,908 --> 02:14:37,954
Now you've tasted my mutton.
How do you like it?

1309
02:14:38,120 --> 02:14:39,497
Look.

1310
02:14:39,664 --> 02:14:42,208
I want you to see this.

1311
02:14:45,044 --> 02:14:47,171
This is you. Right here.

1312
02:14:47,338 --> 02:14:51,217
Notch 45, you Irish bog bastard.

1313
02:15:02,687 --> 02:15:06,190
Why don't you burn him,
see if his ashes turn green.

1314
02:15:11,487 --> 02:15:13,864
Fortune favors the bold!

1315
02:15:26,294 --> 02:15:30,381
- You killed an elected official?
- Who elected him?

1316
02:15:30,548 --> 02:15:33,718
You don't know what
you've done to yourself.

1317
02:15:39,223 --> 02:15:41,767
I know your works.

1318
02:15:42,393 --> 02:15:44,603
You are neither cold nor hot.

1319
02:15:44,770 --> 02:15:49,066
So because you are lukewarm,
I will spew you out of my mouth.

1320
02:15:50,651 --> 02:15:53,154
You can build your filthy world
without me.

1321
02:15:53,321 --> 02:15:55,781
I took the father.
Now I'll take the son.

1322
02:15:55,948 --> 02:16:00,870
You tell young Vallon I'm gonna
paint Paradise Square with his blood.

1323
02:16:01,120 --> 02:16:02,705
Two coats.

1324
02:16:03,289 --> 02:16:05,958
I'll festoon my bedchamber
with his guts.

1325
02:16:06,125 --> 02:16:08,586
As for you,
Mr. Tammany-fucking-Hall...

1326
02:16:08,753 --> 02:16:10,671
...you come down
to the Points again...

1327
02:16:10,838 --> 02:16:14,342
...and you'll be dispatched
by mine own hand.

1328
02:16:16,135 --> 02:16:21,515
Now get back to your celebration
and let me eat in peace. I paid you fair.

1329
02:16:45,331 --> 02:16:47,041
Stop.

1330
02:16:48,042 --> 02:16:49,627
Raise.

1331
02:17:32,712 --> 02:17:34,964
You son of a bitch!

1332
02:17:38,801 --> 02:17:40,803
Challenge.

1333
02:17:42,179 --> 02:17:44,557
Challenge accepted.

1334
02:18:36,233 --> 02:18:39,654
And then it came,
the first day of the draft.

1335
02:18:39,820 --> 02:18:45,201
Thomas O'Neill. Andrew Lewis.
Joseph flynn.

1336
02:18:45,368 --> 02:18:48,579
They read out the draftees ' names
like they was dead already.

1337
02:18:48,746 --> 02:18:53,084
Andrew Martin. J.B. Gleason.

1338
02:18:53,250 --> 02:18:56,003
- The O'Connell Guard.
- The Plug Uglies.

1339
02:18:56,170 --> 02:18:59,423
- As for us, the tribes were gathered.
- Forty Thieves.

1340
02:18:59,757 --> 02:19:02,259
- The Chichesters.
- The drums was beating.

1341
02:19:02,426 --> 02:19:03,761
The Dead Rabbits.

1342
02:19:03,928 --> 02:19:06,889
- The American Guard.
- The Atlantic Guard.

1343
02:19:07,056 --> 02:19:09,725
- The Slaughter Housers.
- The Bowery Boys.

1344
02:19:09,892 --> 02:19:12,228
The Confederation
of American Natives.

1345
02:19:13,646 --> 02:19:14,772
James Mooney.

1346
02:19:14,939 --> 02:19:18,442
But all we could see
was the hand in front of us.

1347
02:19:18,609 --> 02:19:20,611
Sean O'Connell.

1348
02:19:20,778 --> 02:19:24,949
G.W. Morris. John Doyle.

1349
02:19:25,116 --> 02:19:27,785
- When?
- Whenever you like.

1350
02:19:27,952 --> 02:19:30,162
- Daybreak tomorrow.
- Ground?

1351
02:19:30,329 --> 02:19:32,456
Paradise Square.

1352
02:19:32,623 --> 02:19:34,417
Weapons?

1353
02:19:34,583 --> 02:19:39,839
- That I leave up to you.
- Bricks, bats, axes, knives...

1354
02:19:40,172 --> 02:19:41,632
Pistols?

1355
02:19:43,175 --> 02:19:44,635
No pistols.

1356
02:19:45,761 --> 02:19:47,805
Good boy.

1357
02:19:50,349 --> 02:19:53,394
The terms are resolved.
The council's concluded.

1358
02:19:55,313 --> 02:19:59,358
Thomas McEvoy. W.H. Miles.

1359
02:19:59,525 --> 02:20:02,612
- To hell with your damned draft!
- Give them hellfire, boys!

1360
02:20:02,778 --> 02:20:04,322
Rip them apart!

1361
02:20:11,370 --> 02:20:13,914
Kill the rich bastards!

1362
02:20:20,129 --> 02:20:21,756
Uptown!

1363
02:20:23,341 --> 02:20:25,134
You're not getting my son!

1364
02:20:30,681 --> 02:20:33,351
Uptown at the draft office...

1365
02:20:33,517 --> 02:20:38,564
...the cops broke a few skulls,
and everybody run away.

1366
02:20:39,565 --> 02:20:41,984
But the word was spreading...

1367
02:20:42,151 --> 02:20:44,028
...and the dark.

1368
02:20:45,196 --> 02:20:46,572
Up on Fifth Avenue...

1369
02:20:46,739 --> 02:20:50,076
...the Schermerhorns and their mob
breathed a little easy.

1370
02:20:50,242 --> 02:20:53,245
Just a brief burst of anger
over Mr. Lincoln's draft.

1371
02:20:53,412 --> 02:20:55,665
Entirely justifiable in my view.

1372
02:20:55,831 --> 02:20:59,543
- There are two sides to that question...
- There are several sides...

1373
02:20:59,710 --> 02:21:02,254
...but only one right side,
as with any question...

1374
02:21:02,421 --> 02:21:04,715
...that involves the abuse
of executive power.

1375
02:21:04,882 --> 02:21:07,218
In any case, Mr. Greeley...

1376
02:21:07,385 --> 02:21:10,096
...we can all be thankful
that it wasn't any worse.

1377
02:21:10,262 --> 02:21:13,391
It may be worse yet. I saw them.
I don't know what to think.

1378
02:21:13,557 --> 02:21:16,769
Now what is it that you are
so fond of saying, Mr. Tweed?

1379
02:21:16,936 --> 02:21:19,397
Mr. Greeley, you won't like this.
But what is it?

1380
02:21:19,563 --> 02:21:20,606
I don't remember.

1381
02:21:20,773 --> 02:21:25,528
"You can always hire one half
of the poor to kill the other half."

1382
02:21:35,788 --> 02:21:38,124
I've come to say goodbye.

1383
02:21:38,291 --> 02:21:41,252
I've booked passage for California.

1384
02:21:43,754 --> 02:21:46,549
Jenny, give me one more day,
and I'll go with you.

1385
02:21:46,716 --> 02:21:49,051
You'll be dead by then.

1386
02:21:49,593 --> 02:21:53,055
- Well, what would you have me do?
- I don't know.

1387
02:21:55,683 --> 02:21:59,437
- This will all be finished tomorrow.
- No, it won't.

1388
02:22:01,063 --> 02:22:02,606
No.

1389
02:22:03,024 --> 02:22:06,152
This whole place
is gonna burn anyway.

1390
02:22:14,201 --> 02:22:18,956
I've heard that the poor are going
from door to door in the Five Points...

1391
02:22:19,123 --> 02:22:22,668
...asking those supporters
who wish to see further riots...

1392
02:22:22,835 --> 02:22:25,963
...to place a lighted candle
in the window.

1393
02:22:26,380 --> 02:22:28,466
Irish, Poles, Germans, all of them.

1394
02:22:29,258 --> 02:22:35,473
Mr. Greeley, the city is not mad.
I prophesy a very dark night.

1395
02:22:57,703 --> 02:23:01,540
Nobody goes to work today!
We'll shut the factories down!

1396
02:23:01,707 --> 02:23:06,128
When the sun rose next,
the city had split in half.

1397
02:23:06,295 --> 02:23:08,130
From all over New York they came:

1398
02:23:08,297 --> 02:23:11,133
Ironworkers, factory boys,
street cleaners...

1399
02:23:11,300 --> 02:23:12,885
...Irish, Polish, German...

1400
02:23:13,052 --> 02:23:15,846
...anyone who never cared
about slavery or the Union...

1401
02:23:16,013 --> 02:23:18,599
...anyone who couldn 't buy his way out.

1402
02:23:18,766 --> 02:23:21,769
"Let the sons of the rich
go and die, " they cried.

1403
02:23:21,936 --> 02:23:24,981
"Let the sons of the poor stay home."

1404
02:23:26,357 --> 02:23:28,526
The earth was shaking now.

1405
02:23:28,693 --> 02:23:31,404
But I was about my father's business.

1406
02:23:36,492 --> 02:23:38,703
A bunch of fifth Avenue scums!

1407
02:23:45,876 --> 02:23:50,381
Almighty Lord,
you are the dagger in my hand.

1408
02:23:51,674 --> 02:23:54,051
Guide my hand
on this day of vengeance.

1409
02:23:54,218 --> 02:23:58,222
We give thanks to the Lord,
for he is good.

1410
02:23:58,389 --> 02:24:02,727
With you, the swift cannot flee,
nor the strong escape.

1411
02:24:02,893 --> 02:24:07,064
Let my sword devour until its thirst
is quenched with blood...

1412
02:24:07,231 --> 02:24:09,233
...and my enemies sleep forever.

1413
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:11,777
For you are the Lord God of Retribution.

1414
02:24:11,944 --> 02:24:14,405
For the Lord crushes the wicked.

1415
02:24:14,572 --> 02:24:17,199
The Lord is merciful...

1416
02:24:17,825 --> 02:24:21,621
...and his love endures forever.

1417
02:24:22,163 --> 02:24:23,539
- Amen.
- Amen.

1418
02:24:23,706 --> 02:24:24,874
Amen.

1419
02:24:30,880 --> 02:24:33,924
- Run away, you sons of bitches!
- Come on out!

1420
02:24:36,469 --> 02:24:40,598
- Upstairs! Get the women upstairs!
- Father! Father!

1421
02:24:44,435 --> 02:24:46,937

1424
02:24:53,653 --> 02:24:56,948
16th Precinct: All the stores
are closing on Eighth Avenue...

1425
02:24:57,114 --> 02:24:59,116
...from fear of the mob in 17th Street.

1426
02:24:59,283 --> 02:25:01,786
Show us what you got,
you cowardly bastards!

From 4th: The rioters are robbing

- Tear Tammany down!

1431
02:25:21,013 --> 02:25:24,225
The marshal's office is burning down.
The police is of no avail.

1432
02:25:24,392 --> 02:25:25,476
Show yourself, Tweed!

in almost dead.

They're being attacked all over.

1435

Hey! There's a $300 man.
Get him!

1436
02:25:34,944 --> 02:25:38,072

Bill!

1485
02:30:25,401 --> 02:30:26,777
Fire!

1486
02:30:27,445 --> 02:30:28,946
Advance!

1487
02:30:29,697 --> 02:30:31,616
Bill!

1488
02:30:34,702 --> 02:30:36,120
I can't walk!

1489
02:30:37,913 --> 02:30:39,457
Get up!

1490
02:31:43,020 --> 02:31:44,397
Fire!

1491
02:32:12,717 --> 02:32:16,554
- Bastards!
- Shang! Shang, hold off!

1492
02:32:48,919 --> 02:32:51,047
Thank God.

1493
02:32:52,006 --> 02:32:54,842
I die a true American.

1494
02:34:56,839 --> 02:34:59,383
Tomorrow morning,
get our people down to the docks.

1495
02:35:00,468 --> 02:35:05,014
I want every man and woman coming off
the boats given hot soup and bread.

1496
02:35:09,518 --> 02:35:13,022
We're burying a lot of votes
down here tonight.

1497
02:35:30,539 --> 02:35:35,378
In the end, they put candles
on the bodies so 's their friends...

1498
02:35:35,544 --> 02:35:39,757
...if they had any,
could know them in the dark.

1499
02:35:40,925 --> 02:35:44,387
The city did this free of charge.

1500
02:35:45,429 --> 02:35:51,477
Shang, Jimmy Spoils,
Hell-Cat, McGloin and more.

1501
02:35:52,979 --> 02:35:57,441
Friend or foe,
it didn 't make no difference now.

1502
02:36:16,961 --> 02:36:22,967
It was four days and nights before the
worst of the mob was finally put down.

1503
02:36:24,010 --> 02:36:26,679
We never knew how many
New Yorkers died that week...

1504
02:36:26,846 --> 02:36:29,640
...before the city was finally delivered.

1505
02:36:31,017 --> 02:36:36,105
My father told me we was all born
of blood and tribulation.

1506
02:36:37,231 --> 02:36:41,527
And so then too was our great city.

1507
02:36:44,447 --> 02:36:49,201
But for those of us what lived
and died in them furious days...

1508
02:36:49,368 --> 02:36:54,832
...it was like everything we knew
was mightily swept away.

1509
02:36:55,625 --> 02:36:58,753
And no matter what they did
to build the city up again...

1510
02:37:01,005 --> 02:37:03,674
...for the rest of time...

1511
02:37:04,634 --> 02:37:08,929
...it would be like no one even knew
we was ever here.
