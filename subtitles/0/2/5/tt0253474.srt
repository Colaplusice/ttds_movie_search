1
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,313
- Mr. Szpilman?
- Hello.

2
00:01:58,522 --> 00:02:00,899
I came specially to meet you.
I love your playing.

3
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:04,820
- Who are you?
- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.

4
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:07,406
- You're bleeding!
- It's nothing.

5
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:11,410
You can write him a fan letter later.
This isn't the best time. Come on.

6
00:02:11,618 --> 00:02:14,079
Jurek, where have you been
hiding her?

7
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,752
- I don't know what to take.
- You always take too much.

8
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:24,881
How many suitcases are you taking?

9
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,926
What do you think, should I take
uncle Szymon's portrait?

10
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:31,138
Take it, don't take it,
take what you like.

11
00:02:31,304 --> 00:02:33,682
Can't you see I'm worried sick?

12
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,559
He'll come home, he'll be alright.

13
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:39,563
- I should have another case.
- Mama, Wladek is home!

14
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:43,859
Thank God.
Wladek! You're wounded?

15
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:47,070
- No, it was nothing.
- I've been worried sick.

16
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:49,698
I told her not to worry.
You had your papers on you.

17
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:51,700
If you'd been hit by a bomb,
they'd know where to take you.

18
00:02:52,075 --> 00:02:56,747
Henryk, don't say things like that.
God forbid. God forbid.

19
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:58,915
- Papa, Wladek is home.
- What did I tell you?

20
00:02:59,124 --> 00:03:02,377
- What are you doing?
- Where's my hat with the wide brim?

21
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:07,090
- They've bombed us. We're off the air.
- Warsaw is not the only radio station.

22
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:09,050
Pack, darling.
Get your things packed.

23
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:11,219
- Where are we going?
- Out of Warsaw.

24
00:03:11,428 --> 00:03:13,930
- Out of Warsaw where?
- You haven't heard?

25
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:16,683
- Heard what?
- Haven't you seen the paper?

26
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:19,269
- Where's the paper?
- I used it for packing.

27
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:21,855
- She used it for packing.
- The government has moved to Lublin.

28
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,318
All men must leave the city, go across
the river, set up a new line of defense.

29
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:30,280
There isn't anybody left here, only
the women. The men are all gone.

30
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:32,991
What do you think you'll do while
they set up a new line of defense?

31
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,328
- Wonder around with your suitcases?
- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

32
00:03:36,536 --> 00:03:40,165
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Good. I'm not going anywhere either.

33
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:42,918
Don't be ridiculous,
we've got to keep together.

34
00:03:43,126 --> 00:03:46,296
Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to
die in my own home, staying put.

35
00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:50,217
- God forbid.
- Shut up, I've got something. Listen.

36
00:03:50,383 --> 00:03:54,429
...from the BBC in London.
The British government...

37
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:58,767
having received no reply
to the observations presented...

38
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:01,144
to the German government...

39
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:05,148
has declared war on nazi Germany.

40
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:08,944
- That's wonderful! Wonderful!
- It is expected that...

41
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:18,620
...within the next few hours, France
will make a similar declaration.

42
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:22,082
Poland is no longer alone.

43
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:29,172
Wonderful, wonderful!

44
00:04:30,757 --> 00:04:34,594
- Mama, that was a great dinner.
- It certainly was.

45
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:37,180
When there's something to celebrate,
you've got to make an effort.

46
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:40,225
Here's to Great Britain and France!

47
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:44,062
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?
All will be well.

48
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:18,054
Five thousand and three.

49
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:23,185
- Is that all?
- Yes. It's all we've got left.

50
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:26,438
- It's 3,003 too much.
- Look.

51
00:05:26,646 --> 00:05:29,858
"Further restrictions
regarding liquid assets.

52
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:33,153
Jews will be allowed to keep a
maximum of 2,000 zlotys at home. "

53
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,657
- What do we do with the rest?
- Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.

54
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:41,453
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough
to deposit money in a German bank?

55
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,124
We could hide the money. Look here.
We can hide it under the flowerpots.

56
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:49,211
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll use try and tested methods.

57
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:51,755
You know what we did
in the last war?

58
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:55,675
We made a hole in the table leg,
and hid the money in there.

59
00:05:55,884 --> 00:05:58,220
- Suppose they take the table away?
- What do you mean?

60
00:05:58,386 --> 00:06:02,808
Germans go into Jewish homes and
take furniture, valuables, anything.

61
00:06:03,016 --> 00:06:05,685
- Do they?
- Why'd they want a table like this?

62
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:09,773
- What on earth are you doing?
- Listen. Look.

63
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:13,902
This is the best place. No-one would
think of looking under the flowerpot.

64
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:17,114
- No, listen. I've been thinking...
- Really? That's a change.

65
00:06:17,322 --> 00:06:20,450
- You know what? We use psychology.
- We use what?

66
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:25,372
We leave the money and the watch
on the table, covered. In full view.

67
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,919
- Are you stupid?
- The Germans will never notice it.

68
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:34,881
That's the stupidest thing I've ever
seen. Of course they'll notice. Look.

69
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:37,342
Look here.

70
00:06:37,843 --> 00:06:39,344
Idiot.

71
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:42,264
- And you call me stupid.
- Very good. That's the last place...

72
00:06:42,472 --> 00:06:44,474
- This would take hours.
- We're not in a hurry.

73
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:47,727
- It won't take hours.
- How will you get them out? Tell me.

74
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:50,856
- How will you get them out?
- Quiet! Order, please!

75
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:53,650
- You reach them out individually.
- No-one listens to me!

76
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:56,570
Quiet, please, quiet.
Order, order, please.

77
00:06:56,778 --> 00:07:00,866
- The lawyer, she likes order.
- Listen, just listen. Look.

78
00:07:01,074 --> 00:07:04,494
The watch we put under the flowerpot
and the money we stuff in the violin.

79
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:10,917
- But I'll still be able to play?
- You'll find out.

80
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:14,713
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.
- Wladek, how are you?

81
00:07:15,422 --> 00:07:16,882
We're fine, thank you.
And you?

82
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:22,095
Fine, under the circumstances.
I guess I know why you're calling.

83
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:26,308
There's nothing we can do.
They won't reopen the station.

84
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:31,062
- Yes, I know, but I...
- No music, no radio for the Polish.

85
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:34,441
But sure you'll find work.
A pianist like you.

86
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:36,943
Maybe, maybe not, but...

87
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:42,074
don't be offended, but I didn't call
to discuss my future carrier.

88
00:07:42,282 --> 00:07:45,327
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,
and at last he gave in and said...

89
00:07:45,535 --> 00:07:48,580
"All right, come with me tomorrow",
so I came and...

90
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:51,083
they bombed the station.

91
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,628
- Meeting you like that was wonderful.
- Really?

92
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:58,131
Yes, it was unforgettable.

93
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:01,802
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
- Call me Wladek, please.

94
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,097
- No-one plays Chopin like you.
- I hope it's a compliment.

95
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:08,809
- Of course, I mean it.
- I was... trying to be funny.

96
00:08:09,643 --> 00:08:13,146
- Should we go and have a coffee?
- I'd like that.

97
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:18,235
- And you, what do you do?
- I finished with the conservatoire.

98
00:08:18,443 --> 00:08:21,279
- You're a musician?
- Yes. But only just.

99
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:23,949
- What instrument?
- The cello.

100
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:26,618
I love to see women
playing the cello.

101
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:30,872
JEWS FORBIDDEN

102
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:34,167
This is disgraceful.
How dare they?

103
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:37,087
You know what people are like, they
want to be better nazis than Hitler.

104
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:41,007
- I'm going in there to complain.
- It's better not, believe me.

105
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:44,386
- It's humiliating. Someone like you!
- Good-bye.

106
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:50,892
We'll find somewhere else.

107
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:54,271
- We can walk in the park.
- No, we can't.

108
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:57,649
Official decree.
No Jews allowed in the park.

109
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:00,861
- My God. Are you joking?
- I'm not joking, it's true.

110
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:05,741
We could sit in a bench, but
"no Jews allowed on public benches".

111
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:07,701
This is absurd.

112
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:13,582
We can just stand here and talk.
I think we're allowed to do that.

113
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:18,920
So, you play the cello. That's nice.
And who's your favorite composer?

114
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:21,339
Chopin? Really? Well...

115
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:24,342
you'll have to learn to play
his cello sonata, won't you?

116
00:09:24,551 --> 00:09:26,595
What about you, Wladek?

117
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:29,639
Perhaps I could accompany.
Me on the piano, you on the cello.

118
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:33,977
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,
quite wonderful.

119
00:09:36,021 --> 00:09:38,106
Call me Wladek, please.

120
00:09:38,315 --> 00:09:41,818
"Free emblems for Jews
in the Warsaw district.

121
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:44,821
I hereby order that all Jews
in the Warsaw district...

122
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,158
will wear visible emblems
when out of doors.

123
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:52,996
This decree will come into force
on the first of December, 1939...

124
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:56,458
and applies to all Jews
over 12 years of age.

125
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,920
The emblem will be worn
on the right sleeve...

126
00:10:00,128 --> 00:10:03,715
and will represent the blue star
of David on a white background.

127
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:07,260
The background must be
sufficiently large...

128
00:10:07,427 --> 00:10:11,056
for the star to measure eight
centimeters from point to point.

129
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,602
The width of the arms of the star
must be one centimeter.

130
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:20,899
The Jews that do not respect this
decree will be severely punished.

Governor of the Warsaw district,
Dr. Fischer. "

132
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:32,869
- I won't wear it.
- I'm not going to be branded.

133
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:38,708
Let me see this.

134
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:46,508
Does it say that we have to provide
these armbands ourselves?

135
00:10:47,134 --> 00:10:51,263
- Where will we get them?
- We're not going to wear them.

136
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:01,732
You!

137
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:04,818
Come here.

138
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:12,784
Why haven't you greeted us?

139
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,746
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:26,047 --> 00:11:28,508
The sidewalk is forbidden for you.

141
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:30,719
Go to the gutter.

142
00:11:46,443 --> 00:11:50,238
- Have you seen this?
- What? What? I'm working. What?

143
00:11:51,907 --> 00:11:53,366
What is this?

144
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:58,121
- It's where they're going to put us.
- What do you mean "put us"?

145
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:04,002
"By order of the governor of the
Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer...

the Jewish district in Warsaw.

00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:17,808
Look here. "Jews living outside
of the prescribed area...

149
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:23,105
will have to move to the Jewish
district by 31 of October, 1940."

150
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:26,400
They won't get all of us.
It's too small.

151
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:28,485
There's 400 thousand of us
in Warsaw.

152
00:12:28,735 --> 00:12:32,114
No, 360 thousand.
So it will be easy.

153
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:36,034
What am I supposed to do?
You tell me.

154
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:41,331
Mama?

155
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,501
Mama, what is it?

156
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:48,922
20 zlotys!

157
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:52,217
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.

158
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:58,723
What can I buy with 20 zlotys?

159
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:03,186
I'm sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.

160
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:13,405
That's the price.
That's what I'm offering.

161
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:16,241
My advice is to accept.
You won't get more from anyone else.

162
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,203
- But it's a Bechstein!
- 2 thousand. My advice is to take it.

163
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,248
What are you going to do when
you're hungry? Eat the piano?

164
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:26,126
- Get out!
- What's the matter with you?

165
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:28,170
- Stop it!
- We'd rather give it away. Get out!

166
00:13:28,378 --> 00:13:31,423
Haven't you eaten today?
What are you suffering from?

167
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,176
You people are crazy.

168
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:38,221
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand
and I'm paying for the removal.

169
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,891
I'm not even charging
for the removal!

170
00:13:41,975 --> 00:13:44,227
You haven't eaten today.
You're crazy.

171
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:46,188
Take it.

172
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:20,931
Hello.

173
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:24,267
Hello. Hi.

174
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:28,522
I didn't want to come.

175
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,110
I didn't want to see all this, but...
I couldn't stop myself.

176
00:14:33,318 --> 00:14:35,153
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

177
00:14:35,362 --> 00:14:37,280
Good.

178
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:40,992
No, not really.
They arrested my cousin.

179
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:43,453
Jurek says they'll let him out.

180
00:14:44,704 --> 00:14:49,084
- This is disgraceful.
- It won't last long. Don't worry.

181
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:52,087
That's what I said myself.

182
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,881
It's too absurd.

183
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:01,763
I... I should go.

184
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:06,351
Well, I'll see you...

185
00:15:06,977 --> 00:15:08,228
soon.

186
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:14,735
Good-bye.

187
00:15:28,498 --> 00:15:30,375
Well...

188
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:34,504
to tell you the truth,
I thought it would be worse.

189
00:15:40,552 --> 00:15:44,723
- Where will we sleep?
- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

190
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:47,768
You, Henryk and papa, in here.

191
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:51,188
Look.

192
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:54,566
Come and look.

193
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:27,432
Go away.

194
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,768
Go away! Go away!

195
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:33,855
Papa! Papa!

196
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:52,374
- Sell anything?
- Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".

197
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,085
- 3 zlotys.
- It's better than yesterday.

198
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:59,381
Three lousy zlotys. And there are
people there making millions.

199
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:02,134
- I know.
- You don't know, believe me.

200
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:05,637
They bribe the guards,
the guards turn a blind eye.

201
00:17:05,846 --> 00:17:10,434
They bring cartloads of food,
tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

202
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:12,352
And the poor are dying all around
and they don't give a damn.

203
00:17:12,728 --> 00:17:16,189
Excuse me, have you seen
my husband, Izaak Szerman?

204
00:17:16,898 --> 00:17:20,444
A tall handsome man,
with a little gray beard.

205
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:24,990
- I'm afraid not.
- Excuse me. Good-bye.

206
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:28,702
Sleep well. But if you see him,
write to me, yes?

207
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:30,871
Izaak Szerman.

208
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,346
Why do we have to have a gentile
street running through our area?

209
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:50,640
Why can't they go around?

210
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:54,394
Don't worry. They're about to build
a bridge. Haven't you heard?

211
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,189
A bridge! Those idiots.

212
00:17:58,482 --> 00:18:00,817
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

213
00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:04,404
But do you know what I think?
I think they're totally stupid.

214
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:07,449
I have a family to feed.
I spend half of my time here...

215
00:18:07,657 --> 00:18:09,826
waiting for them to let us through.

216
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,163
Maybe they think I come here
to listen to the music?

217
00:18:13,622 --> 00:18:18,293
- What is it? Are you in a hurry?
- What's wrong with you?

218
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,631
- Come on, do something.
- Right. Dance!

219
00:18:22,923 --> 00:18:25,467
- Dance!
- Dance!

220
00:18:25,675 --> 00:18:28,470
Come on, come on! Dance!

221
00:18:31,598 --> 00:18:33,308
Very well.

222
00:18:33,517 --> 00:18:35,394
What about you?
Dance with him.

223
00:18:36,812 --> 00:18:40,899
Let's clear the street,
so the Jews can dance.

224
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:46,279
Come on. And you.

225
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,745
Go on.

226
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:56,164
Faster!

227
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,876
Come on!

228
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,462
Faster!

229
00:19:06,174 --> 00:19:07,843
Come on!

230
00:19:08,677 --> 00:19:11,179
Faster!

231
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:17,811
Come on, move! I said faster!
Come on, Jews!

232
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:20,897
- Keep dancing.
- Dance.

233
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:40,584
Good, they're here.

234
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:45,046
Itzak Heller has been
waiting for you.

235
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:52,512
- What's this about?
- Sit down, have tea.

236
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:55,056
I'll start lunch
when the girls get here.

237
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:03,899
- So, what are you doing here?
- He brought cakes.

238
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:09,488
His father is back in the jewellery
business. He's doing well.

239
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:14,284
Amazing, jewellery.

240
00:20:14,785 --> 00:20:16,745
- We're recruiting.
- Who is recruiting?

241
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:19,289
Don't be clever with me.
I'm coming as a friend.

242
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:21,625
They're bringing Jews in
from all over the country.

243
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,794
Soon there will be half million people
in the ghetto.

244
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:27,798
- We need more Jewish police.
- More Jewish police!

245
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:31,343
You want me to beat up Jews
and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.

246
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:33,970
- Someone has got to do it.
- But why me?

247
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:36,473
I thought you only recruited boys
with rich fathers.

248
00:20:36,681 --> 00:20:38,600
Look at my father, look at us...

249
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:41,770
I'm looking at you, that's why I'm
here. You can have a better life.

250
00:20:41,978 --> 00:20:45,273
- You want to survive selling books?
- Yes, please.

251
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:48,693
I'm doing you people a favor.

252
00:20:49,152 --> 00:20:51,530
What about you?
You're a great pianist.

253
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,116
We've got a police jazz band.
They'd welcome you with open arms.

254
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:57,327
- Join us. You've got no work.
- Thank you, I've got work.

255
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,460
I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.

256
00:21:48,837 --> 00:21:51,214
Who wants me to stop?

257
00:22:40,388 --> 00:22:42,140
I always say,
look on the bright side.

258
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:45,644
You're in a small ghetto with
intellectuals, professional people.

259
00:22:45,852 --> 00:22:49,231
You're better off than us. Here in
the large ghetto it's a cesspool.

260
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:52,442
- You have to give me something.
- You're an artist...

261
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:54,569
you keep peoples' spirits up.
You do enough.

262
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,198
- I want to help, do something.
- You're too well known.

263
00:22:58,407 --> 00:23:03,120
And you know what? You musicians
don't make good conspirators.

264
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:07,249
You're too... too musical.

265
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:13,964
- Who is that?
- Symche.

266
00:23:14,172 --> 00:23:16,216
Majorek.

267
00:23:17,217 --> 00:23:20,262
There are notices going up. City is
to be cleansed of the undesirables.

268
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,348
- There's always notices going up.
- Hello, Symche.

269
00:23:24,391 --> 00:23:27,561
Dyrek. Mrs. Ysken.

270
00:23:29,187 --> 00:23:31,231
Jehuda, working hard?

271
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,235
This is the greatest pianist in
Poland. Maybe the whole world.

272
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:38,238
Wladyslaw Szpilman,
meet Majorek.

273
00:23:38,447 --> 00:23:40,198
- How do you do?
- I know your name.

274
00:23:41,283 --> 00:23:43,744
- I've never heard you play.
- Majorek used to be in the Army.

275
00:23:44,453 --> 00:23:48,749
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got
against him is he's not a socialist.

276
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:53,295
You better go now, Wladek.
It's nearly curfew.

277
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:57,090
You know how many copies
we print of our newspaper?

278
00:23:57,507 --> 00:23:59,217
Five hundred.

279
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:02,596
You know how many people on
average read one copy? Twenty.

280
00:24:02,804 --> 00:24:07,225
That makes 10 thousand readers.
This will start the uprising.

281
00:24:07,434 --> 00:24:10,562
Majorek hides them in his underpants
and leaves them in toilets.

282
00:24:10,771 --> 00:24:13,482
- Toilets?
- As many toilets as I can find.

283
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,109
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

284
00:24:16,318 --> 00:24:18,236
They're too clean for them.

285
00:24:24,242 --> 00:24:26,620
Please, mister, please.

286
00:24:53,563 --> 00:24:56,900
Hold it!
You little bastard!

287
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:01,655
Take this!

288
00:25:01,822 --> 00:25:03,782
Stop it! Stop it!

289
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:05,700
Stop it!

290
00:25:08,412 --> 00:25:11,415
Come on, come on.
Come on, boy.

291
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:21,007
Stand up! Stand up.

292
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:54,207
Please, tonight for once, I don't
want anything bad talked about.

293
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:57,836
- Enjoy your meal.
- Then I'll tell you something funny.

294
00:25:58,044 --> 00:26:00,922
- You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?
- The surgeon.

295
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:05,761
The Germans allowed him into
the ghetto to perform an operation.

296
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:08,972
On a Jew? They let a Pole
to come in to operate on a Jew?

297
00:26:09,181 --> 00:26:12,476
He got a pass, that's all I know.
Anyway, so...

298
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:14,936
he puts the patient to sleep
and starts the operation.

299
00:26:15,103 --> 00:26:17,355
He'd just made the first incision
when the SS burst in...

300
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:21,943
shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja
and everybody else who was there.

301
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:26,531
Isn't that a laugh?

302
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:30,494
The patient didn't feel a thing,
he was anesthetized.

303
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,412
I said nothing bad.

304
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,666
What's the matter with you all?
You lost your sense of humor?

305
00:26:37,751 --> 00:26:39,419
It's not funny.

306
00:26:39,628 --> 00:26:42,923
You know what's funny? You're
funny, with that ridiculous tie.

307
00:26:44,216 --> 00:26:47,094
What are you talking about? What's
my tie have to do with anything?

308
00:26:47,427 --> 00:26:49,471
- I need this tie for my work.
- Your work?

309
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,767
- That's right, I work.
- Playing the piano for the parasites.

310
00:26:53,975 --> 00:26:57,020
- Parasites...
- Boys. Boys!

311
00:26:57,187 --> 00:26:59,648
- They don't give a damn.
- And you blame me for their apathy?

312
00:26:59,856 --> 00:27:03,235
I see it everyday. They don't even
notice what's going around them.

313
00:27:03,443 --> 00:27:05,320
- I blame the Americans.
- For what? For my tie?

314
00:27:05,862 --> 00:27:08,532
The American Jews,
and there are lots of them.

315
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:12,661
What do they think they're doing?
People here are dying.

316
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:15,080
Haven't got a bite to eat.

317
00:27:15,664 --> 00:27:20,335
The Jewish bankers should persuade
America to declare war on Germany.

318
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,645
The lights! The lights!

319
00:27:55,829 --> 00:27:59,916
Turn on the lights.

320
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:05,046
Come on!

321
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:12,012
Open the door!
We want to go in!

322
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:15,724
Open the door!

323
00:28:28,945 --> 00:28:30,947
Stand up!

324
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:36,453
You, stand up! Come on!

325
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,539
Throw him out!

326
00:28:52,177 --> 00:28:54,262
Mama...

327
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:09,444
Come on, run!

328
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:17,763
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.
- Go in. Not you.

329
00:30:36,782 --> 00:30:38,784
- What?
- Come. It's terrible.

330
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:41,995
- What?
- They're hunting people in the streets.

331
00:30:42,245 --> 00:30:44,331
They've taken Henryk.

332
00:30:45,874 --> 00:30:48,794
Go home, alright? Go home,
I'll take care of it.

333
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:03,517
Excuse me. Have you seen
my husband? Izaak Szerman?

334
00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:07,437
- I'm afraid not.
- Tall, handsome, little gray beard.

335
00:31:07,646 --> 00:31:11,191
If you see him, write to me.
Don't forget. Izaak Szerman.

336
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:22,452
What happened here?

337
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:26,248
They've got my grandson. They
pick them up and take them away.

338
00:31:26,456 --> 00:31:30,043
What they do to them,
I've stopped believing in God.

339
00:31:30,877 --> 00:31:33,588
Excuse me. Excuse me.

340
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:36,383
Itzak?

341
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:38,427
Itzak?

342
00:31:38,635 --> 00:31:41,972
Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.

343
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:50,439
- Henryk is in there.
- I haven't seen him.

344
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:52,691
Believe me.
They picked him up.

345
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,699
- Can you help?
- Now you need me. Now you need me!

346
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:03,034
Can you help us?

347
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,246
- It costs.
- I have no money.

348
00:32:06,455 --> 00:32:08,957
Then there's nothing I can do.
You should have joined us.

349
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:13,378
- They told me you had influence.
- Who told you?

350
00:32:13,545 --> 00:32:16,965
People I know. They said
you're an important man.

351
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:21,887
Itzak...

352
00:32:37,152 --> 00:32:39,988
- Hands up.
- How are you?

353
00:32:40,197 --> 00:32:43,742
- How are you?
- You, bandit.

354
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,036
Dead! Dead!

355
00:32:46,244 --> 00:32:49,289
- He's crazy.
- Hands up.

356
00:32:49,498 --> 00:32:52,501
- Want a cigarette?
- Cigarette?

357
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:55,879
Thank you.

358
00:32:56,546 --> 00:33:00,342
Everything is alright!

359
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,594
He looks very happy.

360
00:33:02,803 --> 00:33:05,555
Everything is alright.

361
00:33:05,764 --> 00:33:09,017
Everything is alright.

362
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:12,979
Hands up! Hands up!

363
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,773
It's alright.

364
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:18,610
Help! Help!

365
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:22,322
Let go! Help!

366
00:34:13,415 --> 00:34:16,752
- Why did they pick you up?
- So you go to Itzak Heller?

367
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,338
- Did I ask you to talk to him?
- You're out, aren't you?

368
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:25,260
- Did you beg to that piece of shit?
- I asked him to help you.

369
00:34:25,886 --> 00:34:28,013
What did you pay him?

370
00:34:28,972 --> 00:34:33,268
With what could I pay him? Every
zloty I earn we spend on food.

371
00:34:33,477 --> 00:34:36,396
- I can look after myself.
- They were taking you away.

372
00:34:36,605 --> 00:34:40,358
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's me they wanted, not you.

373
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:43,737
Why do you have to interfere
with other people's business?

374
00:34:43,904 --> 00:34:47,908
- You're mad. That's your trouble.
- That's also my business.

375
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,961
What's the matter?
Are you sick?

376
00:35:00,962 --> 00:35:03,256
Hungry.

377
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:14,351
Employment certificate. What's that
mean, no employment certificate?

378
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:17,270
You have to have an
employment certificate...

379
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:19,940
to work for the Germans
in the ghetto, otherwise...

380
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:22,859
- Otherwise what?
- You'll be deported.

381
00:35:23,068 --> 00:35:26,279
- So the rumors were true.
- They're going to resettle us...

382
00:35:27,155 --> 00:35:30,158
and send us to labor camps,
in the East.

383
00:35:31,993 --> 00:35:34,871
- They're closing the small ghetto.
- Oh, God!

384
00:35:49,553 --> 00:35:51,388
Wladek? Wladek?

385
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:56,143
I thought you were on tour playing
in London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

386
00:35:56,351 --> 00:35:59,020
- Not this week.
- You look terrible.

387
00:35:59,354 --> 00:36:02,065
Have you heard the rumors? They're
going to resettle us in the East.

388
00:36:02,274 --> 00:36:06,236
Rumors! You take it all too much
to heart. What's the trouble?

389
00:36:06,445 --> 00:36:10,657
I've been trying to get the certificate
of employment for my father.

390
00:36:10,824 --> 00:36:14,119
I managed to get one for me and my
family, but I need one for my father.

391
00:36:14,327 --> 00:36:17,372
- I've been to all the firms and shops...
- Why didn't you come to me?

392
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:19,666
I didn't know you were
in the certificate business.

393
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:22,210
I'm not, but Majorek is.

394
00:36:24,254 --> 00:36:26,339
Can you help?
I have no money.

395
00:36:26,506 --> 00:36:29,801
Please, don't insult us.
Can you do something for him?

396
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,304
Be at the Schultz workshop
tomorrow, four o'clock.

397
00:36:32,596 --> 00:36:35,140
See what a wonderful piece
of luck you've had today?

398
00:36:35,348 --> 00:36:39,061
That's the historical imperative in
action! That's why I always say:

399
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:41,563
- "Look on the bright side!"
- Yes, I know.

400
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,620
- How's your back?
- Better.

401
00:36:56,828 --> 00:36:58,747
Better?

402
00:36:58,914 --> 00:37:00,832
Better not ask.

403
00:37:13,345 --> 00:37:18,266
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

404
00:37:20,644 --> 00:37:22,854
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

405
00:38:30,881 --> 00:38:33,884
At least we got work
in the ghetto.

406
00:38:34,718 --> 00:38:37,095
At least we are still together.

407
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:53,111
Everybody out!
To the courtyard!

408
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,572
Move, move!

409
00:38:56,156 --> 00:39:00,327
We are workers. We have
employment certification.

410
00:39:03,997 --> 00:39:06,041
Wait.

411
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,709
Here.

412
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:11,004
Go over there. Hurry.

413
00:39:11,213 --> 00:39:13,090
You.

414
00:39:13,465 --> 00:39:16,051
You. You.

415
00:39:17,803 --> 00:39:19,513
You.

416
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:22,974
You.

417
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:26,436
You.

418
00:39:34,903 --> 00:39:38,198
The others, put your clothes on
and come back here.

419
00:39:38,407 --> 00:39:41,451
Bring your things with you.
15 kilos only.

420
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,454
Where are you taking us?

421
00:40:07,227 --> 00:40:09,646
I'm sorry, I did my best.

422
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,818
- I thought the certificates'd save us.
- Stop it, Wladek.

423
00:40:14,985 --> 00:40:18,447
Let's just hope that Henryk
and Halina will be better off.

424
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:47,100
- Where will we be going?
- You're going to work.

425
00:40:47,267 --> 00:40:50,562
You'll be much better off than
in the stinking ghetto. Move.

426
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:58,779
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

427
00:40:59,488 --> 00:41:04,618
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?

428
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:09,247
Why did I do it?

429
00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:53,291
Don't you have a bottle of water?
He's dying.

430
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,335
My child is dying of thirst.

431
00:41:55,502 --> 00:41:57,337
- I beg you.
- I'm sorry.

432
00:41:57,504 --> 00:42:01,258
- Don't you have water? I beg you.
- Can you hear what I'm saying?

433
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:03,677
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.
- I can hear you.

434
00:42:03,885 --> 00:42:06,096
Letting them take us to our death
like sheep to the slaughter.

435
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:08,348
- Not so loud.
- Why don't we attack them?

436
00:42:08,557 --> 00:42:11,601
There's half a million of us here.
We can break out of the ghetto.

437
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:14,396
At least we can die honorably, not
as a stain on the face of History.

438
00:42:14,604 --> 00:42:17,190
Why are you so sure they're
sending us to our death?

439
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:19,860
You know why I'm not sure?
Because they didn't tell me.

440
00:42:20,402 --> 00:42:23,947
- They're going to wipe us all out.
- What do you want me to do? Fight?

441
00:42:24,156 --> 00:42:26,658
To fight, we need organization,
plans, guns.

442
00:42:26,825 --> 00:42:29,369
He's right. Do you think I'm going
to fight with my violin bowl?

443
00:42:29,578 --> 00:42:32,289
The Germans would never squander
a huge labor force like this.

444
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,833
They're sending us to a labor camp,
it's obvious.

445
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,334
Sure.

446
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:40,756
Look at that cripple, the old people,
the children. They're going to work?

447
00:42:41,006 --> 00:42:44,593
Look at you. You're going to carry
logs on your back?

448
00:43:24,841 --> 00:43:28,011
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!

449
00:43:37,562 --> 00:43:41,775
I missed you.
I wanted to be with you!

450
00:43:50,242 --> 00:43:52,661
I wanted to be with you!

451
00:43:52,828 --> 00:43:54,871
Stupid. Stupid.

452
00:43:55,247 --> 00:43:59,292
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

453
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:02,629
She's getting on my nerves.

454
00:44:06,466 --> 00:44:11,221
- What did she do, for God's sake?
- She smothered her baby.

455
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,560
They prepared a hiding place
and of course they went there.

456
00:44:16,768 --> 00:44:19,521
The baby cried
just as the police came.

457
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:23,692
She smothered the cries with
her hands, the baby died.

458
00:44:24,901 --> 00:44:28,530
A policeman heard the death rattle
and found where they were hiding.

459
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:54,848
What are you reading?

460
00:44:57,184 --> 00:45:01,855
"If you prick us, de we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

461
00:45:02,022 --> 00:45:04,191
If you poison us, do we not die?

462
00:45:04,399 --> 00:45:07,402
And, if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?"

463
00:45:14,701 --> 00:45:18,080
- Very appropriate.
- Yes. That's why I brought it.

464
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,683
Idiot. What does he think
he's gonna do with the money?

465
00:45:39,726 --> 00:45:42,354
Boy, come here.

466
00:45:43,063 --> 00:45:44,773
Come here.

467
00:45:46,066 --> 00:45:47,984
- How much for a caramel?
- 20 zlotys.

468
00:45:48,735 --> 00:45:51,488
For one caramel? What do you think
you're gonna do with the money?

469
00:45:51,696 --> 00:45:53,907
20 zlotys.

470
00:45:55,409 --> 00:45:57,494
We've got 20 between us.

471
00:45:57,661 --> 00:46:00,163
I've got 10, I think.

472
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:05,460
5, 10, 20.

473
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:27,501
- Halina?
- What?

474
00:47:28,835 --> 00:47:32,631
- It's a funny time to say this, but...
- What?

475
00:47:33,632 --> 00:47:36,968
I wish I knew you better.

476
00:47:39,596 --> 00:47:41,556
Thank you.

477
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,907
Szpilman?

478
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:10,544
Papa? Papa?

479
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:15,132
Mama? Halina?

480
00:48:15,716 --> 00:48:18,176
Halina? Mama?

481
00:48:18,802 --> 00:48:23,598
What do you think you're doing?
I've saved your life. Just go! Go!

482
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,271
Don't run!

483
00:48:30,814 --> 00:48:32,774
Anna!

484
00:48:32,941 --> 00:48:35,235
Anna!

485
00:48:54,129 --> 00:48:57,132
Off they go to the melting pot.

486
00:49:00,093 --> 00:49:04,639
- This stays.
- Give it to me!

487
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:12,147
What are you doing?
She's pregnant.

488
00:51:33,163 --> 00:51:35,040
Wladek?

489
00:51:52,474 --> 00:51:55,435
Why are you here, Wladek?

490
00:51:55,644 --> 00:51:58,230
It's like this, I...

491
00:51:59,815 --> 00:52:01,650
We...

492
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,655
All of them, all of them.

493
00:52:06,822 --> 00:52:08,990
All of them.

494
00:52:10,075 --> 00:52:13,870
Perhaps they're lucky.
The quicker, the better.

495
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,124
It's not finished yet. We'll stay
here for a couple of days...

496
00:52:17,332 --> 00:52:19,209
until things die down.

497
00:52:19,418 --> 00:52:22,796
I've bribed the policeman,
he'll come when it's over.

498
00:52:24,923 --> 00:52:28,510
Attention!
On the march!

499
00:52:38,103 --> 00:52:39,980
Onward!

500
00:52:42,274 --> 00:52:45,277
My God, I haven't been outside in,
it must be two years.

501
00:52:45,485 --> 00:52:48,363
Don't get overexcited.

502
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:06,757
It's gold.
Very good price.

503
00:53:26,943 --> 00:53:28,820
Someone you know?

504
00:53:28,987 --> 00:53:30,906
A beauty.
Who is she?

505
00:53:31,114 --> 00:53:35,035
She's a singer. I knew her well.
Her husband is an actor.

506
00:53:35,243 --> 00:53:37,579
They're good people.
I'd like to talk to her.

507
00:53:37,746 --> 00:53:41,458
Don't forget, Wladek.
They hang them for helping Jews.

508
00:54:07,192 --> 00:54:09,486
Turn left!

509
00:54:09,694 --> 00:54:12,072
On the march!

510
00:54:16,076 --> 00:54:18,745
Stop! Halt!
Attention!

511
00:54:25,794 --> 00:54:28,588
At ease.

512
00:54:32,509 --> 00:54:35,178
Turn right!

513
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:44,646
Step forward.

514
00:54:45,188 --> 00:54:46,690
You.

515
00:54:48,859 --> 00:54:51,361
You. You.

516
00:54:52,028 --> 00:54:53,780
You.

517
00:54:57,576 --> 00:54:59,578
Down on the ground!

518
00:54:59,745 --> 00:55:02,789
Down on the ground!

519
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,984
Turn left!

520
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:34,446
On the march.

521
00:56:12,859 --> 00:56:15,028
How long have you been here?

522
00:56:15,237 --> 00:56:18,031
Since last night.

523
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,534
I was pleased to see you.

524
00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:27,499
They're going to start
the final resettlement now.

525
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:31,503
We know what it means.

526
00:56:32,546 --> 00:56:36,299
We sent someone out.
Zygmund, a good man.

527
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:42,055
His orders were to follow
the trains out of Warsaw.

528
00:56:43,348 --> 00:56:45,475
He got to Sokolow.

529
00:56:45,684 --> 00:56:50,230
A man told him the tracks divided,
one branch's leading to Treblinka.

530
00:56:51,898 --> 00:56:55,610
He said everyday freight trains
carrying people from Warsaw...

531
00:56:55,819 --> 00:56:59,656
branch off to Treblinka
and return empty.

532
00:56:59,823 --> 00:57:02,743
No transports of food
are ever seen on that line.

533
00:57:03,535 --> 00:57:06,830
The civilians are forbidden
to approach the Treblinka station.

534
00:57:10,709 --> 00:57:12,919
They're exterminating us.

535
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:19,134
It won't take them long.

536
00:57:20,469 --> 00:57:23,889
We are 60 thousand left,
out of half a million.

537
00:57:24,681 --> 00:57:27,142
Mostly young people.

538
00:57:28,351 --> 00:57:31,313
And this time we're gonna fight.

539
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:35,650
We're in good shape.

540
00:57:35,859 --> 00:57:39,654
Organized.
We're prepared.

541
00:57:39,821 --> 00:57:42,574
If you need help, I...

542
00:58:01,259 --> 00:58:04,471
You! Come here!

543
00:58:05,472 --> 00:58:07,182
Shit!

544
00:58:14,898 --> 00:58:17,192
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

545
00:58:18,276 --> 00:58:20,695
I don't know what I was thinking.

546
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:33,834
Take this! Take this!

547
00:58:47,889 --> 00:58:50,600
Take him away.

548
00:59:05,365 --> 00:59:09,119
I hope you play the piano better
than you carry bricks.

549
00:59:10,704 --> 00:59:13,165
He won't last long
if he goes on like this.

550
00:59:13,373 --> 00:59:16,168
I'll see if I can get him
something better.

551
00:59:37,939 --> 00:59:39,608
Trouble.

552
00:59:39,858 --> 00:59:42,235
Round up only the Jews!

553
00:59:42,486 --> 00:59:45,280
Round up!
Only the Jews.

554
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:48,784
The Polish keep working.
Only the Jews.

555
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:53,705
I have good news for you.

556
00:59:53,914 --> 00:59:58,627
There are rumors going around
that we like to...

557
00:59:58,835 --> 01:00:01,630
to resettle you.

558
01:00:03,465 --> 01:00:08,303
I promise you that now
and in the future...

559
01:00:08,512 --> 01:00:11,932
nothing else is planned.

560
01:00:12,933 --> 01:00:18,980
For this reason, we put
information posters on the wall.

561
01:00:20,273 --> 01:00:23,485
To show you our goodwill...

562
01:00:23,652 --> 01:00:27,447
you should vote one of you
to be allowed...

563
01:00:27,656 --> 01:00:30,534
to go in town daily...

564
01:00:30,951 --> 01:00:36,873
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes...

565
01:00:37,082 --> 01:00:41,378
and one loaf of bread
for each of your workers.

566
01:00:41,545 --> 01:00:46,800
So, why should we do something
like this if we'd resettle you?

567
01:00:47,968 --> 01:00:53,098
You can make good business
out of the things you don't eat.

568
01:00:54,558 --> 01:00:59,980
Isn't that something that you Jews
are good in? Making money?

569
01:01:03,817 --> 01:01:04,901
Dismiss them.

570
01:01:20,584 --> 01:01:24,379
That one, with the string.
The others, tied by wire.

571
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,446
Now!

572
01:03:07,441 --> 01:03:09,359
Majorek.

573
01:03:10,986 --> 01:03:13,822
I have a favor to ask.

574
01:03:14,448 --> 01:03:16,700
I want to get out of here.

575
01:03:19,327 --> 01:03:23,623
It's easy to get out. It's how you'll
survive on the other side that's hard.

576
01:03:23,832 --> 01:03:26,043
I know.

577
01:03:26,793 --> 01:03:30,505
Last summer, I worked for a day
in the Zelazna Brama Square.

578
01:03:30,714 --> 01:03:34,051
I saw someone I knew,
she's an old friend.

579
01:03:34,217 --> 01:03:37,596
A singer, her husband
is an actor.

580
01:03:39,056 --> 01:03:42,976
I've filled their names down and
their address, if they're still there.

581
01:03:43,143 --> 01:03:47,898
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej
Bogucki. They're good people.

582
01:03:48,899 --> 01:03:51,693
Would you try to make contact?

583
01:03:52,778 --> 01:03:58,283
You go to town everyday. Ask them
if they'd help me get out of here.

584
01:04:29,898 --> 01:04:32,484
Have you got any plaster?

585
01:04:41,451 --> 01:04:44,579
What are you up to?

586
01:04:46,123 --> 01:04:48,542
What have you got there?

587
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:52,546
We are allowed to take
food to the ghetto.

588
01:04:52,754 --> 01:04:55,465
Three kilos of potato and bread.

589
01:04:55,632 --> 01:04:57,676
Open it.

590
01:05:01,263 --> 01:05:06,059
- It's only potatoes and bread.
- You're lying. That's not true.

591
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:09,521
Open it.

592
01:05:36,339 --> 01:05:38,425
Potatoes!

593
01:05:41,928 --> 01:05:44,848
You Jews are all alike.

594
01:05:45,057 --> 01:05:48,602
We reach you with a finger...

595
01:05:48,769 --> 01:05:51,688
and you take the whole hand.

596
01:06:04,451 --> 01:06:08,622
If you lie to me again,
I'll kill you. Personally.

597
01:06:31,645 --> 01:06:33,814
I've tried your friends.

598
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:37,275
- They don't live there anymore.
- Did you make contact?

599
01:06:37,818 --> 01:06:39,820
- Be ready to leave.
- When?

600
01:06:40,028 --> 01:06:41,863
- Soon.
- Halt!

601
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:45,325
Shit! Shit!

602
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:48,078
Wait. What's going on here?

603
01:06:48,286 --> 01:06:51,790
Take this! Take this!

604
01:06:57,796 --> 01:07:01,675
I'll teach you some discipline,
you dirty Jews.

605
01:07:05,846 --> 01:07:08,098
Do you know why
you're being hit?

606
01:07:08,265 --> 01:07:11,309
- No.
- Do you know why you're being hit?

607
01:07:11,518 --> 01:07:15,856
- Why?
- To celebrate New Year.

608
01:07:18,066 --> 01:07:20,235
On the march!

609
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,946
March and sing!

610
01:07:23,363 --> 01:07:25,031
Sing something nice!

611
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:28,577
Loud and clear!

612
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:33,248
Reunite tonight
And follow the white eagle

613
01:07:33,457 --> 01:07:37,377
Stand up and fight
Our mortal enemies

614
01:07:37,544 --> 01:07:41,256
Rise on the day
Let's give them fire and brimstone

615
01:07:41,423 --> 01:07:45,260
We'll do away
The Yoke of slavery

616
01:07:45,427 --> 01:07:49,056
Punish and rout
The rapists of our nation

617
01:07:49,222 --> 01:07:53,226
We'll slash them out
To save our dignity

618
01:08:25,509 --> 01:08:27,469
Come.

619
01:09:38,957 --> 01:09:40,584
I'm sorry.

620
01:09:40,792 --> 01:09:43,420
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

621
01:10:07,444 --> 01:10:10,280
We haven't much time.
Come on.

622
01:10:17,662 --> 01:10:19,456
We must hurry.

623
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:21,875
Here. See if this fit.

624
01:10:22,084 --> 01:10:26,046
We have to keep moving you. Germans
are hunting down indiscriminately.

625
01:10:26,254 --> 01:10:29,341
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

626
01:10:29,508 --> 01:10:33,303
You better shave.
Use my razor on the shelf.

627
01:10:47,609 --> 01:10:50,445
You'll be looked after
by Gebczynski.

628
01:10:50,654 --> 01:10:52,572
He's on the other side of town.

629
01:10:52,739 --> 01:10:56,410
You stay there tonight,
then we'll find you somewhere else.

630
01:10:56,868 --> 01:11:01,164
- I'll bring you food.
- Alright, let's go.

631
01:11:38,869 --> 01:11:41,663
I'll show you where
you're going to sleep.

632
01:12:10,817 --> 01:12:13,612
You have to stay here
until tomorrow afternoon.

633
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:18,533
We have a flat for you near
the ghetto wall. But it's safe.

634
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,959
It's not going to be very comfortable.

635
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,379
I'll be fine.

636
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:41,973
Thank you.

637
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:59,366
Here. Here. Give it to me.

638
01:12:59,991 --> 01:13:03,787
Go as near to the front as possible,
to the German section.

639
01:13:21,388 --> 01:13:23,098
DO NOT PASS

640
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:55,589
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

641
01:14:00,886 --> 01:14:04,473
But you leave them open
during the day. Don't forget.

642
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:10,562
Must feel better on
this side of the wall, eh?

643
01:14:10,771 --> 01:14:12,230
Yes.

644
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,819
But sometimes I'm still not sure
which side of the wall I'm on.

645
01:14:19,613 --> 01:14:23,116
Some bread, potatoes, onions.

646
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:26,578
I'll come again.
Janina will visit you twice a week.

647
01:14:26,745 --> 01:14:29,164
To bring more food,
see how you are.

648
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,541
Thank you.

649
01:14:33,752 --> 01:14:36,880
This is very important.
In case of emergency...

650
01:14:37,089 --> 01:14:41,176
I mean emergency,
go to this address.

651
01:15:22,008 --> 01:15:24,094
What do you mean you forgot?

652
01:15:24,261 --> 01:15:27,139
What do you think I mean?
I forgot, that's what I mean.

653
01:15:27,264 --> 01:15:32,644
- You know, you treat me like dirt.
- Because you are a dirt.

654
01:15:32,853 --> 01:15:35,188
- Pig! Pig!
- Bitch!

655
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:38,066
- Dirty pig!
- You are a dirty pig!

656
01:15:38,275 --> 01:15:40,861
Takes one to know one. Pig.

657
01:15:44,781 --> 01:15:49,411
- You play like an angel.
- Then why don't you listen?

658
01:15:49,619 --> 01:15:51,747
- I'm listening.
- Liar.

659
01:15:51,913 --> 01:15:55,125
You fell asleep. Pig.

660
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:19,483
Spread out!
We're being attacked!

661
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:24,196
Take cover!

662
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:26,740
Shoot!

663
01:16:38,377 --> 01:16:41,129
Take cover! Fire!

664
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:47,803
Come on, get out!

665
01:18:11,762 --> 01:18:13,930
The attack was successful.

666
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:18,018
That building...

667
01:18:25,484 --> 01:18:27,486
Turn that way!

668
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:35,744
Shoot!

669
01:18:59,017 --> 01:19:00,894
Thank you.

670
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:07,025
- I wanted to come earlier, but...
- No, thank you.

671
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:14,574
No-one thought
they'd hold out so long.

672
01:19:14,741 --> 01:19:17,202
I never should've come out. I should
have stayed and fought with them.

673
01:19:17,411 --> 01:19:20,706
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

674
01:19:20,872 --> 01:19:23,667
Just be proud of them.

675
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:27,254
- My God, did they put up a fight!
- Yes.

676
01:19:29,256 --> 01:19:31,967
- So did the Germans.
- They are in shock!

677
01:19:32,175 --> 01:19:37,681
They didn't expect it. Nobody
expected it. Jews fighting back.

678
01:19:37,848 --> 01:19:42,477
- Who would have thought?
- What good did it do?

679
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:44,604
What good?

680
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:47,107
Wladek, I'm surprised with you.

681
01:19:47,274 --> 01:19:51,903
They died with dignity.
And you know something else?

682
01:19:52,779 --> 01:19:56,783
Now the Poles will rise.
We are ready.

683
01:19:56,992 --> 01:20:00,245
We'll fight too.
You'll see.

684
01:20:13,925 --> 01:20:16,470
Get your things together.
You have to leave.

685
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:19,181
What? What's happened?

686
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:23,727
- I'm on the run.
- What's happened?

687
01:20:23,935 --> 01:20:27,856
The Gestapo found our weapons.
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

688
01:20:28,732 --> 01:20:32,444
They're bound to find out about this
place too. You must get away at once.

689
01:20:32,652 --> 01:20:34,946
Where do you want me to go?

690
01:20:35,113 --> 01:20:38,492
Look at me, I'm not leaving.

691
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:42,788
- Can I take my chances here?
- That's your decision.

692
01:20:42,954 --> 01:20:45,624
But when they storm the flat,
throw yourself out the window...

693
01:20:45,832 --> 01:20:47,584
don't let them get you alive.

694
01:20:47,751 --> 01:20:50,879
I have poison on me.
They won't get me alive either.

695
01:23:58,942 --> 01:24:01,153
Open up!

696
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:07,868
Open the door
or we'll call the police!

697
01:24:34,644 --> 01:24:38,565
Are you from this flat?
You're not registered.

698
01:24:38,774 --> 01:24:41,860
It belongs to a friend of mine. I just
came to visit, but I missed him.

699
01:24:42,027 --> 01:24:44,404
Have you got your identity card?

700
01:24:44,988 --> 01:24:47,824
- Let me see your identity card.
- Yes, of course.

701
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:52,788
- I want to see your identity card!
- What's happening?

702
01:24:52,996 --> 01:24:55,540
He's a Jew! A Jew!

703
01:24:55,749 --> 01:24:57,542
Stop the Jew!

704
01:24:58,502 --> 01:25:01,129
Don't let him out!
Stop him!

705
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:15,495
- Yes?
- Mr. Gebczynski sent me.

706
01:26:21,418 --> 01:26:25,255
- Wladyslaw Szpilman.
- Dorota.

707
01:26:26,506 --> 01:26:28,425
Come in.

708
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:36,683
I'm sorry.

709
01:26:36,892 --> 01:26:40,228
I was given this address and
I'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.

710
01:26:40,437 --> 01:26:43,940
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.

711
01:26:44,107 --> 01:26:45,776
Come in.

712
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:55,369
Sit.

713
01:26:58,205 --> 01:27:00,457
I need help.

714
01:27:02,209 --> 01:27:05,003
He'll be back before curfew.

715
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:07,672
I've been in hiding.

716
01:27:08,799 --> 01:27:12,177
- I need somewhere to stay.
- He'll be here soon.

717
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:17,307
- How long have you been married?
- Just over a year.

718
01:27:20,018 --> 01:27:22,521
And how is Jurek?

719
01:27:22,729 --> 01:27:24,356
Dead.

720
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:34,449
- When is your baby due?
- Christmas.

721
01:27:35,075 --> 01:27:38,704
This is not a good time to
have children, but then...

722
01:27:40,872 --> 01:27:44,209
This is my husband.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.

723
01:27:44,376 --> 01:27:49,005
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.
- Yes, I remember.

724
01:27:50,799 --> 01:27:53,385
He said to contact you
only in case of emergency.

725
01:27:53,593 --> 01:27:55,387
Don't worry now.

726
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:08,024
We can't move you tonight.
You'll sleep on the sofa.

727
01:28:12,529 --> 01:28:14,281
Excuse me.

728
01:28:18,076 --> 01:28:20,996
I'm sorry,
could I have a piece of bread?

729
01:28:21,204 --> 01:28:23,832
Yes, of course.
We will eat.

730
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:27,961
Sit. Please, sit.

731
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:29,880
Thank you.

732
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:35,714
You're on a very German area.

733
01:30:35,922 --> 01:30:40,135
On the opposite is a hospital taking
wounded from the Russian front.

734
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:45,140
And next door is the
Schutzpolizei.

735
01:30:46,516 --> 01:30:48,769
Safest place to be.

736
01:30:48,977 --> 01:30:51,730
Right at the heart
of the lion's den.

737
01:30:56,651 --> 01:30:58,737
I'll be locking you in.

738
01:30:58,904 --> 01:31:02,783
No-one knows you're here,
so keep as quiet as possible.

739
01:33:07,074 --> 01:33:08,950
All well?

740
01:33:09,493 --> 01:33:11,661
Thank you.

741
01:33:15,707 --> 01:33:19,378
This is Antek Szalas.
He'll be looking after you.

742
01:33:19,544 --> 01:33:21,296
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

743
01:33:21,463 --> 01:33:23,215
Thank you.

744
01:33:23,465 --> 01:33:28,220
I've given him a second key. He'll
bring food, see that you're alright.

745
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:31,223
He's with the underground,
he's a good man.

746
01:33:35,143 --> 01:33:39,189
- You don't remember me?
- I don't think so.

747
01:33:39,398 --> 01:33:42,734
Warsaw Radio.
I was a technician.

748
01:33:43,318 --> 01:33:46,363
I saw you almost everyday.

749
01:33:46,905 --> 01:33:50,242
- I'm sorry, I don't remember.
- It doesn't matter.

750
01:33:52,411 --> 01:33:55,956
You've nothing to worry about.
I'll visit often.

751
01:33:56,748 --> 01:33:59,418
You'll be pleased to hear that
the Allies are bombing Germany...

752
01:33:59,584 --> 01:34:01,545
night after night,
after night.

753
01:34:01,753 --> 01:34:04,131
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.

754
01:34:04,381 --> 01:34:07,551
And the Russians are giving them
hell. It's the beginning of the end.

755
01:34:07,759 --> 01:34:09,261
Let's hope so.

756
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:21,815
Come here.

757
01:34:21,982 --> 01:34:24,109
Be careful with it.

758
01:34:24,985 --> 01:34:27,821
That's it. Be careful.

759
01:34:53,472 --> 01:34:56,224
Still alive then?

760
01:34:59,436 --> 01:35:03,440
Here. Sausage, bread.

761
01:35:03,648 --> 01:35:05,734
You still got that vodka?

762
01:35:19,539 --> 01:35:23,293
- How long is this meant to last?
- Not long now.

763
01:35:23,835 --> 01:35:26,880
I think I've got jaundice.

764
01:35:27,089 --> 01:35:30,759
Don't worry about that.
It just makes you look funny.

765
01:35:31,802 --> 01:35:35,680
My grandfather was jilted by
his girlfriend when he got jaundice.

766
01:35:35,889 --> 01:35:37,724
Drink up.

767
01:35:38,517 --> 01:35:41,436
Why didn't you come sooner?
It's been over two weeks...

768
01:35:41,645 --> 01:35:43,355
Problems.

769
01:35:43,563 --> 01:35:45,565
Money.

770
01:35:45,941 --> 01:35:48,485
I've got to raise money
to buy the food.

771
01:35:48,694 --> 01:35:52,406
I need things to sell,
it's not easy.

772
01:35:56,118 --> 01:35:58,662
Here. Sell this.

773
01:36:00,914 --> 01:36:03,041
Food is more important than time.

774
01:36:08,046 --> 01:36:11,049
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you!
The Allies have landed in France.

775
01:36:11,258 --> 01:36:13,427
Russians will be here soon.

776
01:36:13,885 --> 01:36:16,763
They'll beat the shit
out of the Germans...

777
01:36:17,556 --> 01:36:19,516
any day now.

778
01:37:01,641 --> 01:37:03,602
Wladek?

779
01:37:12,527 --> 01:37:15,447
I knew it.
I knew this would happen.

780
01:37:17,616 --> 01:37:19,826
- I'll get a doctor.
- You can't. It's too dangerous.

781
01:37:20,035 --> 01:37:23,538
- Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.
- Ridiculous. He's a pediatrician.

782
01:37:23,705 --> 01:37:26,083
- He's still a doctor.
- No.

783
01:37:26,291 --> 01:37:29,336
You stay. I'll go.

784
01:38:01,118 --> 01:38:03,829
We came to say goodbye.

785
01:38:04,037 --> 01:38:06,915
We're going to stay
with my mother in Otwocks.

786
01:38:07,124 --> 01:38:10,293
The baby is already there.
It's safer.

787
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:14,423
There's talk that the uprising
will begin any day now.

788
01:38:15,674 --> 01:38:18,552
That man Szalas should be shot.

789
01:38:19,094 --> 01:38:23,056
He's been collecting money
on your behalf all over Warsaw.

790
01:38:23,849 --> 01:38:28,687
Apparently people gave generously,
so he collected a tidy sum.

791
01:38:32,858 --> 01:38:35,569
My God.

792
01:38:38,613 --> 01:38:43,702
The liver the size of a football.
Inflammation of the gall bladder...

793
01:38:44,369 --> 01:38:46,705
but he'll leave.

794
01:38:48,665 --> 01:38:52,753
I'll try to get him some laevulose,
but it's not easy.

795
01:38:52,961 --> 01:38:56,465
- Can you visit him again?
- Who knows.

796
01:38:56,673 --> 01:39:00,635
- Doctor, thank you.
- Don't speak, rest.

797
01:39:04,056 --> 01:39:06,516
Thank you so much for coming.

798
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:10,228
We've brought you some food.

799
01:39:10,437 --> 01:39:14,107
I'll prepare something now
for you, then we must go.

800
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:56,233
I'll throw a grenade!

801
01:40:04,157 --> 01:40:06,576
There's a wounded man over there!

802
01:40:07,077 --> 01:40:09,496
Come.

803
01:40:09,621 --> 01:40:11,957
Watch out! Watch out!

804
01:40:13,041 --> 01:40:15,877
- I'll go get help!
- Hurry!

805
01:40:16,503 --> 01:40:20,340
Come on! Bring the litter!

806
01:40:24,052 --> 01:40:26,555
Go back inside!

807
01:42:11,159 --> 01:42:13,704
Get out, get out in the streets!

808
01:42:13,912 --> 01:42:17,541
Get out now! The Germans
have surrounded the building!

809
01:42:56,955 --> 01:43:01,084
Somebody...
Somebody help me!

810
01:43:56,598 --> 01:43:59,643
Are you alright?
There's too much dust.

811
01:44:00,018 --> 01:44:04,398
I'll check this side.
Don't worry.

812
01:44:04,606 --> 01:44:06,942
Be careful!

813
01:44:12,155 --> 01:44:14,700
- Heinrich?
- I'm checking!

814
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:19,579
Is there anybody here?

815
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:27,462
- Come on down!
- Alright, I'm coming.

816
01:48:25,534 --> 01:48:27,285
Come on, pile them up.

817
01:48:33,375 --> 01:48:35,460
Throw it.

818
01:49:56,291 --> 01:49:59,127
We have to mark everything.

819
01:50:00,128 --> 01:50:01,046
Come on.

820
01:56:44,991 --> 01:56:47,285
What are you doing here?

821
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:53,792
Who are you?

822
01:56:57,754 --> 01:57:01,174
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

823
01:57:03,218 --> 01:57:05,387
What are you doing?

824
01:57:10,934 --> 01:57:12,811
I was...

825
01:57:12,978 --> 01:57:15,897
trying to open this can.

826
01:57:16,565 --> 01:57:19,109
Do you live here?

827
01:57:21,445 --> 01:57:23,321
Do you work here?

828
01:57:23,530 --> 01:57:25,157
No.

829
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:31,079
What do you do for a living?

830
01:57:33,999 --> 01:57:35,709
I am...

831
01:57:37,294 --> 01:57:40,130
I was a pianist.

832
01:57:42,174 --> 01:57:44,301
Pianist?

833
01:58:02,319 --> 01:58:04,237
Come.

834
01:58:28,178 --> 01:58:30,305
Play something.

835
02:03:36,445 --> 02:03:39,114
Are you hiding here?

836
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:45,287
Jew?

837
02:03:48,165 --> 02:03:50,459
Where are you hiding yourself?

838
02:03:52,044 --> 02:03:53,962
In the attic.

839
02:03:57,090 --> 02:03:59,301
Show it to me.

840
02:04:21,823 --> 02:04:24,034
Have you got anything to eat?

841
02:05:08,495 --> 02:05:13,834
According to them,
it's very important that...

842
02:05:20,298 --> 02:05:22,008
Attention!

843
02:05:23,635 --> 02:05:26,555
- At ease.
- At ease.

844
02:06:29,117 --> 02:06:31,036
Jew?

845
02:06:44,883 --> 02:06:46,259
Please.

846
02:06:46,676 --> 02:06:48,637
What does it mean,
all that shooting?

847
02:06:49,179 --> 02:06:51,807
The Russians,
on the other side of the river.

848
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:56,436
You just have to hold on
a couple of weeks, not more.

849
02:08:24,191 --> 02:08:26,860
- What's going on?
- We're leaving.

850
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:32,866
- Are the Russians here?
- Not yet.

851
02:08:35,660 --> 02:08:39,373
I don't know how to thank you.

852
02:08:40,791 --> 02:08:42,918
Thank God, not me.

853
02:08:43,335 --> 02:08:48,715
He wants us to survive. At least,
we have to believe in that.

854
02:08:58,141 --> 02:09:01,353
Here. Take it.

855
02:09:02,354 --> 02:09:06,483
- And you?
- I have another one. Warmer.

856
02:09:10,737 --> 02:09:14,157
What are you going to do
when this is over?

857
02:09:15,909 --> 02:09:20,080
I'll play piano again at
the Polish radio station.

858
02:09:20,914 --> 02:09:22,624
Tell me your name.

859
02:09:22,833 --> 02:09:25,377
Maybe I'll listen to you playing.

860
02:09:25,544 --> 02:09:27,587
Szpilman.

861
02:09:31,633 --> 02:09:34,386
Perfect name for a pianist.

862
02:10:53,298 --> 02:10:55,842
German! German!

863
02:11:18,031 --> 02:11:20,575
Don't shoot, I'm Polish!

864
02:11:21,576 --> 02:11:23,495
I'm Polish!

865
02:11:24,287 --> 02:11:26,873
- Come out with your hands up!
- Please! I beg of you!

866
02:11:27,541 --> 02:11:32,045
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
I beg you, I'm a Polish.

867
02:11:32,254 --> 02:11:34,131
Come down!

868
02:11:37,551 --> 02:11:41,513
Please, I'm Polish.
Please.

869
02:11:41,722 --> 02:11:43,807
He's Polish.

870
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:48,729
Yes, he's Polish.

871
02:11:49,938 --> 02:11:52,274
Why the fucking coat?

872
02:11:53,316 --> 02:11:55,485
I'm cold.

873
02:12:13,712 --> 02:12:16,590
Look at them.
German fuckers!

874
02:12:17,132 --> 02:12:20,010
Murderers! Murderers!

875
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:23,347
- Dirty bastards!
- Assassins!

876
02:12:23,555 --> 02:12:26,850
- Bastards!
- Look at you now!

877
02:12:27,059 --> 02:12:30,812
You took everything I had.
Me, a musician.

878
02:12:31,021 --> 02:12:34,316
You took my violin,
you took my soul.

879
02:12:38,987 --> 02:12:40,572
Musician?

880
02:12:41,740 --> 02:12:43,617
Are you a musician?

881
02:12:44,576 --> 02:12:46,620
Do you know...

882
02:12:46,953 --> 02:12:49,998
a pianist called Szpilman,
from the Polish radio station?

883
02:12:50,207 --> 02:12:55,170
- Of course I know him.
- I helped him to hide himself.

884
02:12:55,962 --> 02:12:58,006
Tell him I'm here.

885
02:12:58,757 --> 02:13:00,842
Ask him to help me.

886
02:13:03,804 --> 02:13:06,431
- What's your name?
- Hosenfeld.

887
02:13:06,682 --> 02:13:07,849
What?

888
02:14:45,739 --> 02:14:48,241
It was here, I'm certain of it.

889
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:52,245
Well, it's not here now.

890
02:14:52,454 --> 02:14:56,375
I shouted, abused them. I'm not
proud of it, but that's what I did.

891
02:14:56,625 --> 02:14:58,001
I stood where you are now.

892
02:14:59,169 --> 02:15:02,339
There was a barbed wire
and this German came up to me.

893
02:15:03,632 --> 02:15:07,135
- You didn't catch his name?
- No.

894
02:15:09,221 --> 02:15:12,391
I'll ask at the factory.
They may know something.
