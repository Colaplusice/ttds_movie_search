00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,360
JANG Dong-gun

2
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,240
WON Bin

00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,080
LEE Eun-joo

4
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,660
Memorial Site for souls
of the Korean War

5
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,040
We're contacting the families
of those we've identified

6
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,910
We'll call you soon

7
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,080
Who received the file for
LEE Jin-seok, number B-38?

8
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,710
LEE Jin-seok?
I did, Why?

9
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,380
I checked the list of
remains and the photos

10
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,510
He's not on K.I.A.
or M.I.A. list

11
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,350
Not even on
the survivors' list?

12
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,600
LEE Jin-seok...

13
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,310
Identity search for participating soldier

14
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,350
the list of participants...

15
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,230
Still alive?

16
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,570
Grandpa!

17
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,700
The Army Headquarters
is on the phone!

18
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,120
hello?

19
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,540
I'm with the Korean War
excavation team

20
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,120
I'm calling to
confirm some information

21
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,840
Are you LEE Jin-seok
who fought at the battle of Dumillyong?

22
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,550
That's right

23
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,640
We've identified some remains
as LEE Jin-seok's

24
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,100
Oh... you did?

25
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,520
But I am LEE Jin-seok

26
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,480
Is there any chance...
it is LEE Jin-tae?

27
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,480
No, it's definitely
LEE Jin-seok

28
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,990
I'm sorry to have
bothered you, sir

29
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,530
It's probably someone
with the same name

30
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,330
What did they say?
Was it about your brother?

31
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,590
I thought it would be since

32
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,090
it was a call from the army

33
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,680
Grandpa, can I help
with the garden?

34
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,690
Could you drive for me?

35
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,490
I can drive him

36
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,490
Don't worry, Mom

37
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,620
The site is on a mountain and
you aren't well

38
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,330
I'll call her later

39
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,500
You got sick after your trip to China
to look for your brother

40
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,500
Yes

41
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,130
Why don't you go
start the car

42
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,010
- Yeah
- Make sure you've got an ID

43
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,470
It's a restricted area

44
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,020
Don't worry
I've got enough IDs

45
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,400
OK then

46
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,770
Are you going to wear
your sneakers?

47
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,690
I'll shine shoes instead

48
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,440
Jong-Ro, Seoul 1950

49
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,430
Shoe shine!

50
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,890
Shoe shine!

51
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,390
Shoe shine!

52
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,480
Shoe shine!

53
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,610
Shoe shine!

54
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,400
Shoe shine!

55
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,490
Shoe shine!

56
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,490
Shoe shine!

57
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,900
Shoe shine!

58
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:38,160
The middle ones are new from Italy

59
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,670
They're beautiful

60
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,540
It's a work of an art

61
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,630
The heels are high and
the stitching is superb

62
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:50,140
Well... I like low heels better
They look more comfortable

63
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,010
- Really?
- But

64
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,270
I bet you can make
so much better than those

65
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,310
It'll take a few more years

66
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:05,530
I'll be so proud when you make shoes
at a shop like this someday

67
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,540
- What did you buy this for?
- You wanted to have one

68
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,500
You look great!

69
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,380
Thanks, Jin-tae

70
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,800
Ice cream!

71
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,590
Ice cream!

72
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,510
- Hey, ice cream!
- Yeah!

73
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,020
- Give me a real cold one
- Why don't you buy two?

74
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,350
- Just one is enough
- OK

75
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,600
Here's one, nice and cold

76
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,270
Take it

77
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,780
- You've already spent too much
- Take it!

78
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,110
- Yours?
- I don't want my teeth to rot

79
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,700
- How much is it?
- It's 2 won

80
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,450
- Thank you
- Have a nice day!

81
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,950
- Take a bite first
- No way!

82
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,960
- Come on, it's melting!
- You eat it

83
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,420
Jin-tae! The tram!

84
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,300
Shoe shine

85
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,010
Where are you going?

86
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,430
We have to go home!

87
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,270
I've finished
the math homework

88
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,350
I'll teach you
something new

89
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,730
You have to teach me tomorrow!

90
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,280
Mom!

91
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,330
You haven't finished yet?

92
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,790
What does it look like to you?
We're busy!

93
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,170
- Jin-seok's here, too
- Hi, Young-Shin!

94
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,090
Stop that
I'll put some on a plate

95
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,260
It's okay, Young-Shin

96
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,230
I told you not to do that

97
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,190
Come here

98
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,520
- Come on, I'm not a child
- Come here

99
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,860
Thank you!

100
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,900
See you next time!

101
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,240
Where did you get
this barley?

102
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,490
I got it for signing up for some
kind of National Correction League

103
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,460
- National Correction League?
- I think barley

104
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,960
for my name is
a good deal

105
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,500
I wish mother had done it, too

106
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,090
Nothing's ever free

107
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,090
I could kill for free food

108
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,140
Hurry up and close the shop
Dad's waiting!

109
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,190
Dad, Jin-seok scored the
top for his last exam

110
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,230
Isn't that a good job?

111
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,190
He'll make your dream come true

112
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,650
Please help him enter the
best university next year

113
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,570
And please keep him healthy

114
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,990
He was very sick last spring

115
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,210
No, but I'm fine now

116
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,260
Young-shin, Mom says
to come in!

117
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,800
Remember her, dad?

118
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,350
Jin-tae is going to marry
her this fall

119
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,980
Mom's worried about such a nice girl
marrying such a rough boy

120
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,610
It'd have made
you so proud...

121
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,120
Mom, the kids must be hungry

122
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,080
Jin-seok, let's clear
the table

123
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,250
Why don't you
go help mom

124
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,000
Open the pot!

125
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,560
Again!

126
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,600
Here, use this from now on

127
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,110
I made it from my skirt

128
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,400
Don't lose it

129
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,880
What did you like
the most?

130
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,380
The meat!

131
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,470
- I liked the cookies
- I liked the fruit!

132
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,970
Can we go swimming?

133
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,100
No, it's too late
We have to go home and sleep

134
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,310
But tomorrow is Sunday
We have no school...

135
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,770
It's too hot to go to bed

136
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,400
- No...
- Please, please...

137
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,290
You look really happy

138
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:19,380
I wish everyday were like this
No more, no less

139
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:31,310
I know, Jin-tae is a little rough
but has a warm heart...

140
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,020
Don't worry. It's not cold

141
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,570
Shall I show you?

142
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,190
Jin-tae, I don't want to do it!

143
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,580
Why are you changing the heels?
The high ones look great!

144
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,710
They look great!
Are you gonna sell them?

145
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,800
You wanna buy them?

146
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,050
If the price is right
I just might

147
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,010
You'll never have enough money
to buy those shoes!

148
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:13,810
Hey, why is this pronunciation
different form the spelling?

149
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,560
Didn't I tell you not to ask me
about spellings?

150
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,280
You don't know the
second grade's stuff?

151
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,940
Shut up and go
get more shoes

152
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,740
Okay, I was going to

153
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,870
Hi, you're gonna teach me
math today, right?

154
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,080
- Why aren't you at the library?
- You haven't heard?

155
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,170
A war has broken out

156
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,430
Any soldiers on leave are
to report to duty right away

157
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,560
This morning the armed forces of
North Korea attacked South Korea

158
00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:01,020
But our brave soldiers are fighting
courageously and pushing them back

159
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,030
Citizens should not be deceived by
the groundless propaganda of the north

160
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,780
Informing you once again

161
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,580
at the 38th parallel...

162
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,040
What are all these?
Are we moving?

163
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,250
We have to carry all these

164
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,300
Only food and clothes
I told you!

165
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,220
Don't worry
I won't ask you to carry

166
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,550
Uncle's house is way too far

167
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,930
- Put that stuff back
- No, I'll carry them

168
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,470
We can't carry all these!

169
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,520
I'll carry them!
I'll carry them all!

170
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,350
Don't be stupid!

171
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,020
I told you I will!

172
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,110
We'll be back soon
I told you

173
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,150
How do you know that?

174
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,150
No one knows what will happen!

175
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,490
The shop is just
starting to do well

176
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,330
Somebody will take it
while we're gone

177
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,790
What about the KIMchi pots
buried in the yard?

178
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,630
And the vegetables
I planted in spring?

179
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,840
They all will be fine
until we get back

180
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,630
What if you're drafted?

181
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,220
Only if they need their boots shined

182
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,390
We have to hurry

183
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,270
The North's solders
are getting close

184
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,400
And the streets are
packed with refugees

185
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,030
Hurry up, Young-ja

186
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,200
Let's go

187
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,290
Mother!

188
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,010
Mom says we must
stay together all the time

189
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,800
- Put Young-min on here
- Young-min

190
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,430
Hold on tight

191
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,940
We won't be long, okay?

192
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,690
Jin-seok, come on!

193
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,690
Jin-seok!

194
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,820
Hold hands tight!

195
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,410
Young-ja!

196
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,630
Dae-gu, July 1950

197
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,470
What the hell is that train
sitting over there for?

198
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,260
I told you
trains for civilians are not running!

199
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,900
Where's a pharmacy?

200
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,190
I don't know

201
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,610
Let's go to the war front

202
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,660
And destroy the communists!

203
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,990
We must protect our country!

204
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,540
I think we have to
give up the train

205
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,420
- What about that one?
- It's leaving for the front

206
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,710
- Is Jin-tae back?
- Not yet

207
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,590
Jin-tae will bring you

208
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,720
some medicine in a minute

209
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,020
Salute!

210
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,910
Excuse us, but we're
on official business

211
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:40,240
Men between 18 and 30
step forward

212
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,790
Between 18 and 30!

213
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,500
It's nothing serious

214
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,130
Just step forward

215
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,960
- What's going on?
- It's nothing serious, don't worry

216
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,960
- What year were you born?
- I was born in 1921

217
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,800
Step forward then

218
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,800
It will be over soon
so please cooperate

219
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,510
Between 18 and 30!

220
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,020
How old are you?

221
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,690
- Ei... eighteen
- Step forward

222
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,650
- What's going on?
- and also people at the back...

223
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,860
step forward

224
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,240
- Men between 18 and 30
- Don't go

225
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,400
You don't need to follow
their orders

226
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,450
Don't worry, It's just some
questions, I guess

227
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,990
- It's going to be okay
- Come on, let's go

228
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,830
Everything will be fine
I'm still a student

229
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,920
- I'll be fine
- No, Jin-seok!

230
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,880
You aren't allowed to go

231
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,550
- Jin-seok!
- No, Jin-seok!

232
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,560
To position!

233
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,230
- Salute!
- student soldier

234
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,980
Loyalty!

235
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,030
Back to position!

236
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,870
Don't worry
It's going to be Okay

237
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,790
Give this to Young-min

238
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,120
- What happened?
- Jin-seok...

239
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,880
What happened to Jin-seok?

240
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,630
The soldiers took him
with all the young men

241
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,260
he's not back yet

242
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,630
Jin-tae!

243
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,640
- We'll go
- We'll fight

244
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,010
We'll win!

245
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,200
- student soldier!
- student soldier!

246
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,080
- volunteer soldier!
- volunteer soldier!

247
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,460
Brave volunteer student soldiers

248
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:57,010
long live Korea
but now brave soldiers

249
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,840
Where are you going?

250
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,260
I'm looking for my brother

251
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,220
You're not permitted in here
You'll have to leave

252
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,400
- Jin-seok! Jin-seok!
- Stop right there!

253
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,690
Jin-tae!

254
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,610
Let's go!
This isn't the train to uncle's house

255
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,200
We're leaving soon
Sit down

256
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,120
My brother got on the wrong train
We're getting off

257
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,410
I said sit down

258
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,210
You must be mistaken

259
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,880
We're refugees

260
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,500
not soldiers

261
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,630
You've just been drafted, too

262
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:41,300
Then who's gonna look
after my mother? You?

263
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,340
Sit down!
That is an order

264
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,010
You order your soldiers
We are leaving

265
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,810
I told you to sit down!

266
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,730
You must be mistaken

267
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,900
Why can't you understand

268
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,820
Jin-seok
get off now!

269
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,500
Jin-seok
go, now!

270
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,220
Stay still!

271
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,310
Jin-tae!

272
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,400
Jin-tae!

273
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,410
Jin-tae!

274
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,750
My brother has a problem

275
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,550
with his heart
He can't even run

276
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,260
Tell that at the
training camp

277
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,010
Only those without arms or legs
or who can't talk or hear

278
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,510
At war, they're
called patients

279
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,830
Jin-seok, Jin-tae!

280
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,420
Jin-tae!

281
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,340
What are you doing, you bastard!

282
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,100
Mom!

283
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,770
- Mom!
- Mom

284
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,180
Jin-seok, Jin-tae!

285
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,610
Mom, Young-shin!

286
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,150
- Jin-tae!
- Mom, here, here!

287
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,110
Mom!

288
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:08,820
Mom, here!

289
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,240
- Jin-seok!
- Here, here!

290
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,580
- Jin-seok!
- Mom! Mom, here!

291
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,700
Mom!

292
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,460
Go to uncle's home first
We will meet you later

293
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,290
I'll take care of Jin-seok

294
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,710
Don't worry!

295
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,880
- What happened to your face?
- Take care of mom

296
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,010
Don't worry about us

297
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,260
You take care of yourselves

298
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,600
You must come home!

299
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,600
You must come home!

300
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,940
Jin-tae...

301
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:46,610
Mom!

302
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,360
Mom!

303
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,910
Jin-tae! Jin-seok!

304
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,160
Mom!

305
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,230
Hey, help me

306
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,950
Fucking bastards!

307
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,160
Pour that all over!

308
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,620
You communist dogs...

309
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,880
I should have burn them
to death Fucking bastards...

310
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,130
- KANG Yong-jin!
- Yes sir!

311
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,340
- KIM Ki-tae
- Yes, sir!

312
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,550
- LEE Jin-seok!
- Yes, sir!

313
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,520
Excuse me, sir

314
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,850
- May I have a word with you sir?
- Go ahead

315
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,440
This is my younger brother
Please let us stay close

316
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,980
He's just a student and
knows nothing about war

317
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,900
I'll teach him
Please

318
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,400
Alright

319
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,200
Here, Nakdong River
is our last line of defense

320
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,290
If this place is taken
the next is Busan, and then...

321
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,710
we've got nowhere to go
but into the sea

322
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,710
If you retreat
I'll kill you myself

323
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,300
This is where we
live or die

324
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,630
Write your wills and

325
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:38,810
whatever you wanna leave
put it in here, Got it?

326
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,480
- Attention, salute!
- Sir!

327
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,110
Damn young punk

328
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,450
What does he know about
death and wills?

329
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,660
Okay, let's say hello

330
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,570
- I am GO Yong-man
- I am LEE Jin-tae

331
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,160
Let me ask you something
Are you two related?

332
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,170
- He's my older brother
- You're brothers? Damn!

333
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,670
I thought they were only supposed
to take one per family!

334
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,300
Who's going to carry on
the family name?

335
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,880
Is the country going to?

336
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,590
Those bastards

337
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,890
Forget the will!

338
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,720
Forget it!

339
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,390
You never know when

340
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,390
the next meal will come

341
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,020
Eat this shit

342
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,860
Just call me Uncle Yang

343
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,520
He's the eldest
in our platoon

344
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,990
He's a self-proclaimed fortuneteller
but he's never right

345
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,410
Welcome

346
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,950
Don't ever take your helmet off

347
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,500
Many get their heads
blown off while sleeping

348
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,290
I'm Sergeant LEEM

349
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,580
I hate anything red
especially the reds!

350
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,000
I am Tae-soo, I escaped
from North Korea

351
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,220
But don't mistake me as a commie

352
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,880
I'm Seung-chul

353
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,600
I was a student but
I volunteered to fight

354
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,430
Say 'Hello', PFC Jo

355
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,020
Whatever for, We'll all be
dead soon anyway

356
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,980
- I'm PFC Jo
- I am Yong-goo

357
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,770
Just call me radio man

358
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,650
I am KIM Cheol-soo
I go by Ban

359
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:19,570
They are asking me
to fight, eating this?

360
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,910
No water or soup at all?

361
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,040
And mine's so damn small!

362
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,790
You don't want it?
Give it to me

363
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,000
Eat it

364
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,600
Jin-seok!

365
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,770
Jin-seok, are you okay?

366
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,490
Jin-seok, you okay?

367
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,320
Stay right there

368
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,910
Stay put

369
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,500
Jin-tae

370
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:16,560
I told you to
stay there!

371
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,950
Jin-seok, Jin-seok!

372
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,030
Hang on, Jin-seok!

373
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,870
Please keep breathing!
Jin-seok, You can do it

374
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,000
Jin-seok, breathe in!

375
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,420
Now breathe out

376
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,800
More, more!

377
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,220
Spit it out!

378
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,430
Now breathe in!
Jin-seok, You can do it

379
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,100
Deeper, deeper, Jin-seok!

380
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,200
You're okay!

381
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,570
Okay, okay

382
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,580
You're fine

383
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,750
Please send my brother
to the hospital

384
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,590
I'll blow up their tanks or
bring you their commanders

385
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,800
I'll even carry a bomb

386
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,890
- into their camp
- There is one with an epileptic

387
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:35,440
Another has pulmonary tuberculosis
One in 3rd platoon has rheumatism

388
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,900
Another with with heart disease
And one with pulmonary tuberculosis

389
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,980
Need more?

390
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:44,530
Should I send them all?
Who'll fight then?

391
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,410
Life and death crosses

392
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,620
here every second

393
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,410
If you do
what you've said

394
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,620
and I can even send
your brother home!

395
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,420
I'll do whatever I can do
if I can send him home

396
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:04,010
That's the spirit we need

397
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,670
You have to give to
your country

398
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,720
before asking for something

399
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,890
Just for your information

400
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,020
it's been done before

401
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,770
There, a father and son
were in the same unit

402
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,940
who could send his son home

403
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,900
Wanna know how?

404
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,000
Wills are for dying people

405
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,460
You've got to be strong

406
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,010
I wish all this
would just be a dream

407
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,930
I want to wake up in my room

408
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:01,020
I'd tell you about this
over breakfast

409
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,780
I would tell you that
I had a strange dream

410
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,030
Then I would go to school

411
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,080
and you and mom would go to work

412
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,790
Don't worry
We will be just fine

413
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,510
Urgent call from
the battalion bunker, sir!

414
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,260
What is it?

415
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,840
The 2nd and 3rd have
lost their positions

416
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,010
Damn it!

417
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,010
- Wake them up!
- Yes, sir!

418
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,930
Everybody, wake up!
Everybody up! Up!

419
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,480
Area 721 and

420
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,690
area 734 have

421
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,530
fallen into the enemy's hands

422
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:53,280
Additionally, our supply route
has been cut off

423
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,790
This means
we're isolated

424
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,500
Remove all the rocks

425
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,370
They're shrapnel
waiting to happen

426
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,250
Area 731 and 732 are gone
We're next!

427
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,920
The bastards are gonna
hit us hard, like dogs

428
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,510
There won't be anyone
left to bury us

429
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,510
Let the commies come!

430
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,470
I'll kill everyone I can!

431
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,810
Attention!

432
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,310
Sergeant HUH, KOH Yong-man
LIM Tae-soo, KANG Hyo-Yul

433
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:25,480
YANG, JANG, LEE Seung-chul
Get armed and come with me

434
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,650
What's going on?

435
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,190
There's an order to plant mines
on the defense line

436
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:33,110
Shit, that's right
under their noses

437
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,610
So what?

438
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,490
I have to go there?

439
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,830
I'm going, too

440
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,750
Yong-man is out
Jin-tae is going, instead

441
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,620
Rest of you get back to

442
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,500
what you were doing

443
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,250
Yes, sir!

444
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,670
- Damn, I always get the shit
- Jin-tae!

445
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,470
- Jin-tae!
- Hurry up!

446
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,450
Those commies will
take over anytime

447
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:24,080
They slaughter the families
of soldiers and cops

448
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,040
That's why we've got to

449
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,090
win this war!

450
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,090
If we lose, the commies
will kill us all!

451
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,590
Win to live

452
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,220
Win how?
Eating mud?

453
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,800
Get back to work!

454
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,700
Aimed fire!

455
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,790
Hide yourselves quick!

456
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:14,710
- Get down!
- Seung-chul! Don't move!

457
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,300
Be careful of the land mine
Seung-chul!

458
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,440
Yang and I will
go get him!

459
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,900
Cover us!

460
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:46,000
Seung-chul, hang on
hang on there!

461
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,840
I'll be there soon
so don't move!

462
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:06,100
crazy bastards, don't shoot
don't shoot!

463
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,060
the kid's gonna die!
we have to go quick!

464
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,320
Let's go!

465
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,360
Where's private LEE
you bastard!

466
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,070
I don't know sergeant

467
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,410
- Jin-tae!
- Only a few left

468
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,870
Let's finish them!

469
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,830
Jin-tae!
No, retreat! Now!

470
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,000
Jin-tae! are you
out of your mind?

471
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,430
Hey! LEE Jin-tae

472
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,390
Quick, you bastard

473
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,400
He was shot in the stomach
and on his leg

474
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,610
Hold on

475
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,980
- Hurry up!
- Hold him tight!

476
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,150
Hold tight, you bastard

477
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,320
Take it easy
Seung-chul!

478
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,320
We must take him
to the hospital

479
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,530
Hey, you bastard! There's
no way to carry him out!

480
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,240
Sew him up right now!

481
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,290
- Hurry up
- Sew him up!

482
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:22,880
- What should I do with this?
- Hold on, bastard!

483
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,820
You okay?

484
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,400
LEE Jin-tae

485
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,490
I'll kill you if you
do that again

486
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,200
I mean it

487
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,500
One more minute
he would have died

488
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,210
Got it?

489
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,380
Why the hell did you
go for that mission?

490
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,000
Tell me

491
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,010
You weren't on the list
but you volunteered for it

492
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,010
Why is that?

493
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,930
I don't understand
why you did that

494
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,180
Just forget it

495
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,810
What if it was you
laying there

496
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,600
with your guts open!

497
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,980
Promise me
you won't do that again

498
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,770
Promise!

499
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,610
Alright

500
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,620
All I need is
just water

501
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:40,130
Why the hell are they
playing that music?

502
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,800
They know we're isolated

503
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,510
They're gonna drive us crazy

504
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:56,100
Remember the ice cream?

505
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,110
It was so good

506
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,990
Back home, you can eat it
till your teeth go numb

507
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,620
I wonder what mom

508
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,370
and Young-shin are doing...

509
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:21,420
I bet... Mom is really
worried about us

510
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,260
Uncle would be taking
good care of them

511
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,220
I miss them all

512
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,010
Young-guk, Young-ja
Young-min...

513
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,100
I should've...

514
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,100
set the dog free

515
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,320
- Seung-chul
- What's wrong?

516
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,030
Okay there?
Make him lie down

517
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:56,040
Uncle Yang...
my stomach hurts

518
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,160
Don't worry
You'll be okay

519
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,380
Where's my leg?

520
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,220
You call yourself doctor?

521
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,090
Don't see the maggots?

522
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,300
What are you good for?

523
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,720
Food?

524
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,020
Why no more?
Damn! It's about time!

525
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,570
Give us more!

526
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,820
Stop, you bastards!

527
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,700
My ears are exploding!

528
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,290
Are you gonna make us
go through hell?

529
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,170
You want to give up
Nak-dong River?

530
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,300
Seung-chul!

531
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,930
Seung-chul
Put it down

532
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,790
Seung-chul

533
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:21,000
Why couldn't you wait
just a little longer?

534
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,420
Dismiss

535
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:32,130
- Go back to the trench
- Shit!

536
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:35,050
We're going to die
here like dogs?

537
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:37,680
Starve to death
or shot to death

538
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,390
Who says we're gonna die?

539
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:43,560
They haven't given us food
or water for days!

540
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,190
We'll die
an honorable death

541
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,320
Soldiers are human, too!

542
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,490
What's the honor when
starving to death?

543
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,070
- Shut up!
- You crazy bastard

544
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:55,200
You'd go to them for
a piece of bread

545
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,780
It's better than
starving to death

546
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,950
Okay then, go on!

547
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,460
Go join the commies
I'll kill you before you get there

548
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,540
Surrendering is better than

549
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,130
starving to death like animals!

550
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:09,380
Who gives a shit who wins!

551
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,800
Is that ideology
important enough

552
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,260
to kill each other over?

553
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,090
You finished?

554
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,560
This is totally different from

555
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,430
our fight against Japan!

556
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,060
You damn communist!

557
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:25,770
Fuck, give back your badge!
you crazy fuck!

558
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,810
Stop it, son of a bitch

559
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:50,300
- Let go, let go!
- You son of a bitch!

560
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,720
Stop it, son of a bitch

561
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,930
Okay, let's die, you bastard
today, okay?

562
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,310
We're gonna die anyway

563
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:02,430
- Die, fucking bastard!
- Take it easy!

564
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:06,850
The communists slaughtered

565
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,270
- his entire family
- I didn't do it!

566
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,610
This ain't circus!
Go back to the bunker!

567
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:15,780
This is it?

568
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,280
Let's attack them

569
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,830
We're so weak we can

570
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,410
- barely lift our guns
- One more day

571
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:26,460
and we'll be eating corpses

572
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,630
Or surrender to
the commies

573
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:31,750
They wouldn't expect us
to attack them

574
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:34,340
We've got nothing to lose
haven't we?

575
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,340
Let's go in and
wipe them out

576
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,970
I will fight!

577
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,470
I will, too!

578
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,810
I will follow too

579
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,680
- I will go too
- I will go along

580
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,560
- I will go
- Hey, count me in

581
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,480
- I'll go too
- Me too

582
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,610
One mistake can

583
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:54,530
- kill us all
- Let's go and kill 'em all!

584
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,460
Sir!

585
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,840
I don't understand

586
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,550
why I'm out of the mission

587
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,260
You're not qualified

588
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,300
I am!
Let me join them!

589
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,680
- I have to be with my brother
- It's too late

590
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,020
I'm begging you, I want to
fight with others

591
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,230
Your brother begged me to sit you out

592
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:30,730
and now you wanna go?

593
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,730
What are you risking
your life for?

594
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:37,490
- You need a medal, too?
- What medal, sir?

595
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,480
Attack!

596
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,940
Attack!

597
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,890
Fucking bastard!

598
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,450
Fuck, kill 'em all!

599
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:23,130
Die all of you...
die!

600
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,030
Please... don't kill me

601
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:50,820
I'm only 15

602
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:53,320
I just got drafted

603
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:55,450
Please don't kill me

604
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,120
Please...

605
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,540
Die...

606
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,060
Die!

607
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,540
Watch out!
They are coming from side!

608
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,260
Jin-tae, where are
you going?

609
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,470
Come back, Jin-tae!

610
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,390
Jin-tae!

611
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,770
I said come back!

612
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,730
Jin-tae!

613
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,650
Jin-tae!

614
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:12,540
Jin-tae!

615
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,160
Son of a bitch!

616
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,420
If they take this bunker

617
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,880
we are finished, Got it?

618
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,050
Yes, sir!

619
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:03,760
You fucking babies

620
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:06,760
How dare you betray us
like that?

621
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,340
Hurry up!

622
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,750
You are lucky to be alive

623
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,170
Jin... tae!

624
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:12,470
Jin-tae!

625
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,520
- Jin-tae!
- Jin-seok!

626
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:35,870
Are you okay?

627
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,950
Good

628
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,000
Let's go get some water

629
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,250
Jin-tae...

630
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:48,750
Why do you volunteer for

631
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,960
every single risky mission?

632
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:53,130
For a Medal...

633
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,100
To send me home?

634
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,600
What the hell are you doing?

635
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,440
You think you're bulletproof?

636
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:06,860
Every second I see
someone killed!

637
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,440
Are you mad?

638
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,650
Suppose you get the medal!

639
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,740
I'd be happy to go home
with leaving you dead?

640
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:19,240
How could I look at
mom and Young-shin?

641
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,040
You're still young and ill

642
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,790
But I'm a soldier now

643
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,960
Don't ask them to sit
me out again

644
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:28,920
You and I should be together

645
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,340
We live and die
together

646
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,510
Ifyou do this again
I wont' forgive you

647
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:38,140
Don't get me wrong

648
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,770
Already 15 dead
from our unit alone

649
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:45,520
but no one knows
who's gonna die next...

650
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,150
If I can live
staying behind

651
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:49,770
I will stay behind

652
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,820
- Please understand me
- No way!

653
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:55,700
You want me to
watch you die?

654
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:59,410
I won't die, until I get you
back home safely

655
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,830
- Let's go
- Jin-tae!

656
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:06,120
You know

657
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:08,380
I want both of us to live

658
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,420
But if only one gets to go

659
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,840
I want it to be you

660
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,260
You alright?

661
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:27,770
You all did a great job!

662
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:30,520
Besides our victory

663
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:32,940
there is one more good news!

664
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:34,730
The U.S marines made

665
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:37,450
a successful landing
at Incheon

666
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:44,540
We'll push in as they make

667
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:47,250
the 2nd attack into Incheon

668
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:04,430
Your bravery exemplifies

669
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,560
the men of this battalion

670
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:10,940
Raise this flag on Mt. Baekdu
by the Chinese border

671
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,940
Yes, sir!

672
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:44,350
Seoul, September 1950 Mr LEE, Could you look
at the camera when you are taking the picture?

673
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:47,220
Mr LEE, Could you look at the camera
when you are taking the picture?

674
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,520
Why were two brothers from
the same family in the same battle?

675
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,020
We had no other choice
but to volunteer the army

676
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:57,650
in order to protect
our country

677
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:58,860
from danger

678
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:02,360
We heard you did
a great job at Nak-dong river

679
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,830
Any other motivation
for fighting so bravely?

680
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,250
My only motivation
as a soldier

681
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:12,830
is to fight to prevent

682
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,130
my family from
suffering under

683
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,840
the oppression of
the communists!

684
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,970
Jin-tae!

685
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,430
I'm going to send
a letter home

686
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,470
Tell me what you
wanna write

687
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:28,810
We have to send it
with a local

688
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:30,310
Do I have to do it now?

689
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:31,810
- Sergeant LEE
- Yeah!

690
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,850
Let's do it later
I have to go to the reception

691
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:35,900
We've got to ask one of
the people on the street!

692
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,440
- Sergeant LEE
- Yeah!

693
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,230
You write something for me
See you later!

694
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:40,570
Jin-tae!

695
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,950
What is this?
Are you kidding me?

696
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:51,410
Give me some eggs!

697
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:56,540
Give me the eggs

698
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,840
Behave yourself!

699
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,760
Come on YANG!

700
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,340
Come on, an egg!

701
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,430
Is there anyone from
in Manri-dong?

702
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,600
Who lives in Manri-dong?

703
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,440
I don't remember
the last time I ate like this!

704
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,820
Nothing but vegetables!

705
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:21,030
Where's my egg?

706
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,780
So, do you like it?

707
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,030
You know, Jin-tae is

708
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,240
really going to be on TV?

709
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:29,030
You saw him

710
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,750
with the American officers

711
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:33,290
and the cameras flashing

712
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:36,040
That's Sergeant LEE
as of today

713
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:39,090
And he's squad leader
of the 1 st

714
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:42,420
He was talking well
'For the families oppressed by the reds... '

715
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,050
A hero is born

716
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:45,760
You envy him?

717
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,180
Then kill the communists!

718
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:52,020
He sure does have
a face for TV

719
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,890
My gosh, this guy
doesn't know anything

720
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,270
What do you know
about photogenic?

721
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:59,610
That kind of face is
good for nothing practical

722
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,730
He's nothing
compared to this

723
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:06,240
Damn, what a knock out!

724
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,990
How did you get
a wife like this!

725
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:11,620
I told you to look at
my son, not my wife

726
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:14,660
I saw you looking
at her breasts!

727
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,290
Give it to me

728
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:19,540
My son'll be a General like
MacArthur someday

729
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:22,130
I also have a wife in
the North

730
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,800
- MacArthur!
- When'll this

731
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,170
damn war be over?

732
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,930
I thought it'd last
only a week

733
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:33,100
When you go home
you go back to school

734
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,600
It'll be soon, since
the U.S has joined

735
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,140
Yeah, right

736
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:41,520
Your home is near here
isn't it?

737
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:46,240
If your mom's back in Seoul
she'll be searching for you two

738
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,360
Just one each!

739
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,120
- Congratulations
- Thank you

740
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:00,750
Jin-seok!

741
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:04,090
You know what this is?

742
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:08,130
This is the chocolate

743
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,760
you wanted so much

744
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:17,140
Just tell me
if you want more

745
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,440
They will

746
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:24,770
give me more
any time I tell them

747
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:30,200
Yes, I drank a little

748
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,120
Don't worry

749
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,950
You'll be home soon

750
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:41,330
It's only a matter of days before
I put this flag on Mt. Baekdu

751
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,510
You should be sleeping

752
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,800
It will get rough
from tomorrow

753
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,180
- Did you send the letter?
- I asked someone

754
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,900
I don't think
they're back in Seoul

755
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,530
It's getting cold
at night

756
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:51,360
You should go inside

757
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:56,450
You felt like
a stranger today

758
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:58,540
I kept worrying

759
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,870
I've been thinking
about things

760
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:08,670
There's one thing
I want you to do

761
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:12,050
Please forget about the medal

762
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:14,720
It's not worth it

763
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:19,760
You're the only
brother I have...

764
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:23,440
And we have to
go back alive

765
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,520
You know, right?

766
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:31,230
I was so scared

767
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,240
when dad died and

768
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:37,450
mom couldn't speak anymore

769
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:41,870
But you helped me
get through it all

770
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,420
Jin-tae

771
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:48,130
The day after tomorrow

772
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:54,050
You were supposed to get
married to Young-shin

773
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:59,720
I hope you think about Young-shin

774
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:06,060
And all our family
not only me

775
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,450
Pyongyang, North Korea
October 1950

776
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:41,140
3rd unit, block off the back road

777
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,640
He surely didn't get out yet

778
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:45,560
2nd unit, 2nd unit!

779
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,480
You can't let him go!

780
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,110
You must get him alive, got it?

781
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:10,460
The commies are
hitting back hard!

782
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:12,750
Where's their captain?

783
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,630
Shit, sons of bitches!

784
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,940
- Cover me
- What?

785
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:36,230
Sergeant LEE!

786
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:39,360
Jin-tae!

787
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,650
A few more up there!

788
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,230
I saw them!

789
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,610
- Cover me
- Too dangerous!

790
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:21,570
- My brother's in danger
- Sit down!

791
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:24,660
Get down

792
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,870
It's dangerous!

793
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:13,620
Come with me

794
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:09,760
Yong-man and KIM
come with me!

795
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,020
- What's going on?
- The captain is escaping

796
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,180
This isn't your business

797
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:14,770
The 3rd platoon is
here for that!

798
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:16,310
The 3rd is waiting
on the way out!

799
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:17,730
This is an order!

800
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:21,520
- Don't go
- Come on!

801
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:22,940
Sergeant LEE!

802
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:26,200
Damn!

803
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,230
Sergeant LEE!

804
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,030
Sergeant LEE!

805
01:11:33,370 --> 01:11:34,660
Sergeant LEE!

806
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:39,330
Stay still, don't move
you son of a bitch

807
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:41,830
Stay still, don't move!

808
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,580
you son of a bitch!

809
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,230
Yong-man

810
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:04,810
- Don't move!
- Shoot me

811
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:05,730
Not now!

812
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:08,020
You think I'm gonna
say a thing?

813
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:10,030
Get up!

814
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:14,320
Yong-man, please wake up
Yong-man!

815
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:17,780
Am I gonna die?

816
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:19,160
Yong-man

817
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:20,410
Medic!

818
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:24,710
Kill me now!

819
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:27,250
Yong-man, don't give up!
I won't let you go!

820
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:28,380
Yong-man! you okay?

821
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:31,300
- Yong-man, come on!
- No, Yong-man!

822
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,220
Yong-man!

823
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:42,060
- Get up!
- He is the captain!

824
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:54,360
I got him!

825
01:12:54,490 --> 01:12:56,240
I got him alright!

826
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:58,580
- Yong-man
- Yong-man!

827
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:00,700
- Come on!
- Yong-man...

828
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,580
GO Yong-man

829
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:28,440
To position, salute

830
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:35,530
Back to position

831
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,030
We'll continue over
to Aprok River

832
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:43,370
near the Chinese border

833
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:47,620
I hope every one of you get
there safe and alive

834
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:49,080
Let's leave

835
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:28,370
What's wrong?

836
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:37,510
The medal... who are you
really doing this for?

837
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:42,930
You love being a hero
don't you?

838
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:46,470
Promotions, parties
interviews...

839
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:52,560
Who knows? You might even
be battalion commander, right?

840
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:54,770
Keep this in mind

841
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:58,570
Yong-man's son, Min-seok

842
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:01,030
will grow up without
a father

843
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:04,200
And bear a grudge
against you forever

844
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:09,000
- Stop it
- If you'd listened to me back there!

845
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,790
He wouldn't be dead!

846
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:14,210
Do you know why he died?

847
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:17,090
Do you know what you
were doing

848
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:19,260
while he was dying?

849
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:23,600
What good is the medal
when people are dying for it!

850
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:26,890
Not another word

851
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,400
What the...

852
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:25,370
This is Seagull One

853
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:27,580
The communists have

854
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,950
slaughtered all
the villagers

855
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,160
Roger

856
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:39,590
Report to headquarters

857
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,340
Let's take care
of the bodies

858
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,340
This is Seagull One

859
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:50,180
We will take off after recovering
the bodies at Dongjin, Over!

860
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:10,700
Help me
Please find my mom

861
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:13,370
Please find my mom

862
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:18,210
- Don't cry, I will help you
- Help me

863
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,060
Medic! Medic!

864
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:38,480
They even left traps!

865
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,820
Don't let even one of
those bastards live!

866
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,550
Get up, you communist bastard

867
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:10,640
Son of a bitch!

868
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:14,980
Die!

869
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:24,990
You dirty pawn of
American imperialism!

870
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:34,200
Please, don't kill me

871
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:56,470
Fuck, son of a bitch

872
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:03,770
Get up, you fucks!

873
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:10,110
Go on and sit down!

874
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:31,070
I surrender

875
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:33,490
- Hey, you!
- I surrender

876
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:38,120
- How many are in there?
- There are five

877
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,950
They'll come out, too
Please don't kill us

878
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:42,620
You killed them, right?

879
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:45,920
No, they were dead
when we came

880
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,880
One more lie, you're
dead, got it?

881
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,130
You killed them?

882
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:50,960
- Don't shoot!
- Shut up!

883
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,050
Don't lie to me!

884
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:55,970
Oh, please!

885
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:01,980
Yong-seok!

886
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:04,100
Jin-seok!

887
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:08,480
- What happened?
- Jin-seok!

888
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:13,030
I was forced to join the North
Korean army or be killed

889
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,360
Now it's okay
don't cry

890
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,500
Drink this

891
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,460
Should I report?

892
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:30,460
Jin-tae!

893
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:33,130
Report that all the enemies
were killed in battle

894
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:35,970
- What are you talking about?
- They'll be excess baggage

895
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:39,470
This is Yong-seok!
He was like your own brother!

896
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:42,180
All I see now is
a communist

897
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:44,890
I am Yong-seok
your friend!

898
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:49,480
I know shoeshine boy Yong-seok
but that's not you

899
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:53,570
PFC LEE, move away!

900
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:55,700
We're not communists

901
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:58,070
He was forced
to come here!

902
01:21:58,110 --> 01:21:59,280
You step back!

903
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:01,160
- Did you kill them?
- No!

904
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,620
we didn't! Really!

905
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:04,250
He says he didn't!

906
01:22:04,330 --> 01:22:06,670
- I don't believe a commie
- They are animals!

907
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:08,250
- Get out of the way!
- Jin-seok!

908
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:10,250
- Come out!
- Let go!

909
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,960
Don't kill me! Jin-tae

910
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,050
Please don't kill me
Jin-tae... Jin-tae

911
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:15,590
Get your hands off!

912
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:20,510
Kneel down!

913
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:23,970
- You dirty pig!
- Don't kill me

914
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,810
Go ahead

915
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:30,560
and I'll report that you kill

916
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,690
unarmed soldiers

917
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:35,650
We're no better than
the commies killing civilians!

918
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,450
You are all crazy!
They're hostages!

919
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:40,240
You saw what they did!

920
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,990
They're animals!

921
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:44,450
If we kill them
we are animals, too

922
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:47,790
It was them who
started the war!

923
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:51,170
We're the same
No better, no worse!

924
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:54,880
Okay, kill them
Shoot!

925
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:58,680
What are you waiting for?
Shoot!

926
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:04,970
Shoot, shoot!
Go on and shoot!

927
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:07,270
Today's your lucky day!

928
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:09,390
Get up!
go, you bastards

929
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:20,860
Hye-San-Jin, far northern Korea
November 1950

930
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:32,580
Yong-seok

931
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:36,210
Jin-seok!

932
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:37,880
Take it

933
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,260
Boys! Have some

934
01:23:49,810 --> 01:23:52,480
- Are you okay?
- I feel fine

935
01:23:58,030 --> 01:23:59,400
Take your time

936
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:04,780
I filed a report about you
with the regimental office

937
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,120
Thanks a lot

938
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:12,960
Jin-tae is... not who he was

939
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,580
He's so changed

940
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,090
Just before I left, I met
your mom and Young-shin

941
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:21,970
Really?

942
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:25,050
How are they? When did
they come back home?

943
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,220
Just after you
were drafted

944
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:29,600
She wanted to be home

945
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,980
in case you came back

946
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:35,610
She asked people about you

947
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:40,610
Whenever she saw me
she cried

948
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:42,780
I reminded her of you two

949
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:48,490
And the noodle stand?

950
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:51,290
Frankly... she isn't well

951
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:52,710
What's wrong?

952
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:55,420
Is it serious?

953
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:58,880
I don't know exactly...

954
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,880
but she couldn't move well

955
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:06,470
Young-shin was
having a hard

956
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,600
time, caring for everyone

957
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:11,890
The commies wouldn't
let her run the stand

958
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:15,190
She attends rallies all day long

959
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:17,810
It's the only way
to get food

960
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:20,980
Don't worry, though

961
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:24,990
Things may be
getting better

962
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,620
I miss the noodles

963
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:33,290
your mom cooks

964
01:25:38,670 --> 01:25:41,550
The loser doesn't eat
for two days!

965
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:45,090
Do it right, bastards!

966
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:49,930
- Won't you do it right?
- Kill him! kill him!

967
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:52,270
Do it right, bastards!

968
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:55,770
2 days aren't bad enough?
You want 5?

969
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:58,560
You ain't hungry?

970
01:25:58,730 --> 01:26:02,070
You crazy bastard
do it right!

971
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,700
You see now?

972
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:10,280
Like this! Like this!

973
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:14,200
Think of him
as South Korean pig

974
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:16,210
Like this!

975
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:19,210
Fight until one gets
knocked out

976
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:21,380
If not, I'll kill
both of you

977
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:22,380
You got it?

978
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:23,880
You got it!

979
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:27,380
Who's going to be
the damn South Korean?

980
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:30,100
You do it!

981
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:31,680
You don't need to

982
01:26:33,810 --> 01:26:36,940
You don't have to
It's you and me now

983
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:39,980
- What the hell are you doing?
- Isn't this a game?

984
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:42,730
Fight, or you'll die
of starvation

985
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:44,780
- Stop it!
- Come on

986
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:47,780
Come on, son of a bitch!

987
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:51,410
Come on!

988
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:57,290
There you go
that's the way

989
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:14,010
We're not done yet!

990
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:31,620
We fight until one
of us can't get up!

991
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:33,490
We fight until the end!

992
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,280
- You are killing him
- Let go!

993
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:16,410
Anyone tries to stop me
I'll kill you, too!

994
01:28:16,910 --> 01:28:20,710
Get up, or you'll
starve to death!

995
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:25,710
Come on!
Fight or you're dead

996
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,880
I said, fight, you pig!

997
01:28:29,130 --> 01:28:31,880
Bring it on!
Bastard!

998
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:14,590
Many of our brave soldiers

999
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:17,260
sacrificed their lives
for their country

1000
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:19,430
And the long awaited victory

1001
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:21,980
Is very close

1002
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:25,270
- Just stay still!
- It hurts!

1003
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,610
I can't help it

1004
01:29:26,610 --> 01:29:28,570
When the hell can we go home?

1005
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:31,150
And General MacArthur
has ordered

1006
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:33,780
UN forces to advance
to the north

1007
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:36,410
The victory is ours

1008
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:38,120
You all did a great job

1009
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,740
Reunification is right before us...

1010
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:42,290
Victory!

1011
01:29:45,870 --> 01:29:49,210
2nd battalion!
What's going on over there?

1012
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,800
We're going home!
home!

1013
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,810
Ok, let's kick some ass!

1014
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:04,100
It looks like the war

1015
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:05,600
may be over soon

1016
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:08,770
I wouldn't be so sure
I heard Chinese will back the north

1017
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:12,110
That's just commie propaganda

1018
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,610
Uncle Yang
what do you think?

1019
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:19,780
The Sunspot and Great Bear

1020
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:22,370
are losing energy now and...

1021
01:30:22,490 --> 01:30:26,370
We will be home
before the New Year

1022
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,580
You really sure this time?

1023
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:30,380
What the hell!

1024
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,300
Okay, I believe you

1025
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:35,090
Sergeant LEE

1026
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:37,340
Sergeant LEE

1027
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,050
Congratulations!

1028
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:44,980
He'll get the Medal of Honor!

1029
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:50,520
I expected it
you would get it

1030
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:53,440
You got it for catching
the captain alive

1031
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:55,860
The commander is
really pleased

1032
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:59,610
- What is that medal of honor?
- You idiot!

1033
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:02,080
Any time 'honor' is in
the medal's name, it's good

1034
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:05,870
Tomorrow the commander will

1035
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,000
award it himself tomorrow

1036
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:12,170
Let's give him a big hand!

1037
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:21,600
Sergeant LEE, now you can
be a soldier forever

1038
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:30,190
Jin-seok!

1039
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:32,980
Let's talk

1040
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,980
Make it short
I'm on duty

1041
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:38,900
You can go home soon

1042
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:41,570
Then go back to school
right away

1043
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:43,070
You missed a lot

1044
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,240
You're the one that needs

1045
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,200
to go home
You're sick

1046
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:49,250
I'm not going home

1047
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:52,000
You'll do what I say

1048
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:55,920
- I don't want anything from you
- Listen to me

1049
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:58,050
What's wrong with you?

1050
01:31:58,590 --> 01:32:01,470
I worked my ass off
for that medal!

1051
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:03,260
This is a great chance
for us!

1052
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:05,390
For you, not for me

1053
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:08,350
Have you thought about
what the medal means?

1054
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:10,100
I don't care

1055
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:12,600
I needed one to
send you home

1056
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:15,230
That medal costs Yong-man's life!

1057
01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:16,980
I won't go

1058
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:18,820
You have to go to college!

1059
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:20,610
What good is college now?

1060
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:23,070
I hate everything
you stand for

1061
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:24,820
Don't tell me what to do

1062
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:26,740
Do you really mean that?

1063
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:28,370
I will make my own decisions

1064
01:32:28,370 --> 01:32:29,910
Don't tell me what to do

1065
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:32,830
You really want
either of us to die?

1066
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:35,380
Then, you go home instead!

1067
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,880
What did I risk my life for?

1068
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,090
I didn't ask you to!

1069
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:52,310
I want... you to go home alive

1070
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:57,320
I also want to go home
y'know

1071
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:00,110
But you are our family's...

1072
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:02,200
dream and hope!

1073
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:06,280
I never regretted
giving up school

1074
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:08,910
and shining shoes for you

1075
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:14,170
Mom happily broke
her back for you

1076
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:16,790
Do you know our sacrifices?

1077
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:20,090
I know all

1078
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:23,680
Why am I the only one you
think about?

1079
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:26,340
If you think about
Young-shin and

1080
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:29,220
Yong-man, you couldn't have done it

1081
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:34,690
I don't care what you think
as long as you can go home

1082
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:46,910
The command post will leave first

1083
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:49,580
Take the classified documents
and burn the others

1084
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:50,870
Yes, sir!

1085
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,370
One more telegram

1086
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:56,170
Retreat to 2nd rendezvous point
Date of Order 09:00 hours

1087
01:33:56,170 --> 01:33:59,090
Regiments 12, 13 and 25
are already retreating

1088
01:33:59,090 --> 01:34:00,920
US army is retreating, too

1089
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,090
How many Chinese
reinforcements are coming?

1090
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:05,260
For Woon-san city alone
at least 100,000

1091
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:08,050
They'll fire on
us any minute, sir

1092
01:34:19,610 --> 01:34:21,860
Hurry, they're
getting close

1093
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,860
Sergeant LEE
what are you doing?

1094
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:28,660
What the hell!
Everything was going so well

1095
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:30,780
People of Chosun fucking liberated

1096
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:32,990
We'll never get home
before New Year!

1097
01:34:32,990 --> 01:34:35,160
We're just gonna leave?
How stupid!

1098
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:38,080
Shouldn't we die here?

1099
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:41,090
This is wrong!
We should be fighting

1100
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:43,880
Stop bitching and hurry up!

1101
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:48,800
I wanted to believe your shit
but look at this!

1102
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,500
Hey, make it fast!

1103
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:23,090
Get the jeep ready!

1104
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,930
How far are we
gonna carry them?

1105
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:48,740
- Don't move!
- Who the fuck are you?

1106
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:57,290
Get him!

1107
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:02,290
Oh fuck!

1108
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,170
Hold!

1109
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:14,680
- Sergeant Huh!
- I'm alright, retreat

1110
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:17,600
Medic!
Call the medic!

1111
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,020
Sergeant Huh!

1112
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,070
Bastards...

1113
01:36:26,110 --> 01:36:29,070
Where's my arm?

1114
01:36:36,910 --> 01:36:39,120
Stay back
or I'll kill him!

1115
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,870
- Put the dagger away!
- You come closer and I'll kill you!

1116
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:44,290
Kill them all!

1117
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,750
Don't come any closer

1118
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:50,260
Don't come any closer

1119
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:54,390
Hurry, just kill them!

1120
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:56,100
Don't come any closer

1121
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:57,510
Shoot him!

1122
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:59,180
Step back!

1123
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:04,060
Ifyou come closer
this bastard is dead!

1124
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,580
No!

1125
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:25,790
Yong-seok, come on!

1126
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:31,170
Yong-seok! Yong-seok!

1127
01:37:48,610 --> 01:37:51,780
Are you crazy?

1128
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:55,780
How could you...
How could you do that to...

1129
01:37:56,820 --> 01:38:00,290
You bastard!

1130
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:07,460
Stop this!

1131
01:38:10,210 --> 01:38:13,090
Bring him back!

1132
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:15,470
You're a murderer!

1133
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:22,390
What the hell are you doing?

1134
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:25,690
You two knock it off!

1135
01:38:25,810 --> 01:38:27,690
We're all gonna die!

1136
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:34,570
We've got to get out of here!

1137
01:38:46,850 --> 01:38:50,390
How come... we're
retreating without fighting?

1138
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:21,680
Jang-Dan, near the 38th parallel

1139
01:39:44,490 --> 01:39:46,030
Line up, line up!

1140
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:48,540
Line up, line up!

1141
01:39:57,590 --> 01:39:59,500
Staff Sergeant LEE Jin-tae

1142
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:03,970
You're awarded the Medal of Honor
for your actions

1143
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:08,510
in Pyongyang your remarkable bravery
and actions at many battles

1144
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:10,470
and for going beyond
the call of duty

1145
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:14,520
'December1 st 1950
President RYEE Syng-man'

1146
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:27,570
Staff Sergeant Lee Jin-tae!

1147
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:30,040
Congratulations
you've finally made it!

1148
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:30,910
Thank you!

1149
01:40:30,910 --> 01:40:34,750
This should have been
a formal occasion, Sorry

1150
01:40:38,170 --> 01:40:42,090
1 st battalion, proceed
to the 3rd rendezvous site

1151
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:44,130
2nd, 3rd and 4th battalions

1152
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:45,760
to the 5th rendezvous point

1153
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,510
Be at your locations
by 18:00 hours tomorrow

1154
01:40:47,510 --> 01:40:50,430
All forces will be
reorganized there

1155
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:54,140
Now you'll go to your
assembly areas

1156
01:40:54,270 --> 01:40:55,440
Dismiss

1157
01:40:56,690 --> 01:40:58,940
See you at the next site

1158
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:05,950
- Sir, may I have a word with you?
- Go ahead

1159
01:41:05,950 --> 01:41:08,450
Sir, it's about my
younger brother

1160
01:41:08,450 --> 01:41:10,740
I'll make an official request

1161
01:41:10,870 --> 01:41:13,120
with the division commander

1162
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:15,330
Thank you, sir

1163
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:18,330
I'm afraid we'll be
pushed down to Seoul

1164
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:21,460
I'm afraid we're going further
to the south, across Nakdong

1165
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:23,550
You know where Jin-seok is?

1166
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:25,130
He left a minute ago

1167
01:41:25,970 --> 01:41:27,550
- By himself?
- Yes

1168
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:30,720
He said he was going to
see your mom

1169
01:41:30,890 --> 01:41:32,640
She is sick

1170
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:14,430
- Get on quick!
- Let's go!

1171
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:22,860
Mom!

1172
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,780
Mom!

1173
01:42:39,330 --> 01:42:40,580
Jin-seok!

1174
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,210
Young-shin!

1175
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,300
Jin-seok...

1176
01:42:55,810 --> 01:42:57,640
Thank God, You're alive

1177
01:42:57,810 --> 01:42:59,980
This isn't a dream, is it?

1178
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:07,230
I'm on my way
to reassemble

1179
01:43:07,230 --> 01:43:11,280
I ran into Yong-seok
He said mom is sick

1180
01:43:11,610 --> 01:43:15,450
She's feeling much better now
She's back at work

1181
01:43:15,450 --> 01:43:20,370
How is Jin-tae?
Why didn't he come?

1182
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:24,170
He's fine
He's really busy right now

1183
01:43:25,290 --> 01:43:29,970
That's good
Mother is so worried

1184
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:38,180
Are you KIM Young-shin?

1185
01:43:38,430 --> 01:43:39,640
Yes, I am but?

1186
01:43:39,770 --> 01:43:42,020
Come with me
You're under investigation

1187
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:43,480
For what?

1188
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:45,610
What?

1189
01:43:45,730 --> 01:43:47,860
- What's this, who the hell are you?
- Jin-seok!

1190
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:51,110
- Tell me what this is about
- Step away!

1191
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:53,030
Stop!
Stop right there!

1192
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:55,490
Shoot if you dare
Put her on

1193
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:59,540
Put the son of a bitch on!
Check if he's a communist

1194
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:04,670
Young-guk, go home!
Don't follow me!

1195
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:22,310
Get off!

1196
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:28,820
- Young-shin, Young-shin!
- Jin-seok, Jin-seok!

1197
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:33,320
What is this place?

1198
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:36,030
This is where we investigate
commies like Young-shin!

1199
01:44:36,030 --> 01:44:37,870
You're making a mistake

1200
01:44:37,990 --> 01:44:40,080
We'll see about that

1201
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,500
Get in there!

1202
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:58,680
LEE Jung-ja, JUNG Kook-sup
KIM Young-shin

1203
01:44:58,850 --> 01:45:00,180
Get up!

1204
01:45:14,030 --> 01:45:15,200
Aim!

1205
01:45:18,910 --> 01:45:20,950
Don't even think about it

1206
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:23,870
Let's not hurt each other

1207
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:27,580
Get up, Young-shin

1208
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:30,000
Jin-tae...

1209
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:31,880
Where is Jin-seok?

1210
01:45:33,210 --> 01:45:35,670
He was taken into
the front building

1211
01:45:35,670 --> 01:45:37,180
What's going on?

1212
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:43,720
They just said I was under
investigation and took me here

1213
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:46,640
We're executing traitors
according to the law

1214
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,810
I don't care what you're doing

1215
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:51,570
- I'm taking her
- Then you're a commie, too!

1216
01:45:51,570 --> 01:45:54,480
- I don't think so!
- KIM Young-shin, 23

1217
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:57,360
signed up for the communist
party on June 23

1218
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,360
We have her signature!

1219
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:02,870
I did it only for food
I didn't know what it was!

1220
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:05,910
She worked for
the communist party 35 times

1221
01:46:05,910 --> 01:46:09,040
And participated in
numerous communist rallies!

1222
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:13,750
We were starving
I have to get food somehow!

1223
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:17,340
The South Korean government
gave us nothing!

1224
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:19,970
Shut up!
You step away

1225
01:46:20,090 --> 01:46:23,060
- Don't be stupid
- You're dead, too

1226
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:25,020
Touch her you're all dead!

1227
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:26,980
This is the last warning
Step aside

1228
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:28,190
Don't move!

1229
01:46:31,230 --> 01:46:32,860
Or you won't walk
out of here in piece

1230
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:35,400
Do you know what
you are doing?

1231
01:46:35,530 --> 01:46:38,570
I'm stopping you from
killing innocent people

1232
01:46:38,570 --> 01:46:40,410
Get her out of here!

1233
01:46:40,450 --> 01:46:42,320
You wanna save a whore?

1234
01:46:42,450 --> 01:46:44,580
She was with every single
North Korean officer!

1235
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:46,660
Shut your damn mouth
before I'll blow it off!

1236
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:48,960
That's why she isn't fleeing

1237
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:52,330
- That's not true
- Don't pretend you don't know

1238
01:46:52,330 --> 01:46:55,460
- It's no use denying it
- No, that's a lie

1239
01:46:55,460 --> 01:46:57,590
- Go now!
- Last warning

1240
01:46:57,710 --> 01:47:01,180
If you take her out of here
you two are commies too

1241
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:03,760
No, Jin-tae

1242
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:06,100
Jin-tae, believe me

1243
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:09,060
Get the hell out of here!
Bring them out and go!

1244
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:11,100
- Now!
- Stop right there!

1245
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:41,990
Young-shin!

1246
01:48:48,830 --> 01:48:51,500
Young-shin, hold on!

1247
01:48:55,620 --> 01:48:57,960
Hold on, Young-shin!

1248
01:49:00,710 --> 01:49:04,590
You... still have
the handkerchief

1249
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:10,390
You don't know...
how much I missed you

1250
01:49:10,930 --> 01:49:17,400
I... didn't do anything
shameful, Believe me

1251
01:49:17,810 --> 01:49:19,480
Nothing, Jin-tae

1252
01:49:21,230 --> 01:49:23,780
Young-shin!

1253
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:27,280
I can't die now...

1254
01:49:29,450 --> 01:49:32,870
How can I die now?

1255
01:49:33,290 --> 01:49:34,910
Our young brothers...

1256
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:37,580
people...

1257
01:49:40,210 --> 01:49:41,880
Jin-tae...

1258
01:49:46,430 --> 01:49:47,680
Young-shin!

1259
01:49:49,930 --> 01:49:51,180
Young-shin...

1260
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:15,290
Young-shin!

1261
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:19,580
Young-shin!

1262
01:50:55,830 --> 01:50:58,000
Why did you question her?

1263
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:04,710
You know you killed her

1264
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:07,800
you killed her, you...

1265
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:12,470
You killed her
you murderer...

1266
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:16,520
You shot members of
the Anti-communist Federation?

1267
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:21,350
The Medal of honor doesn't give
you the right to shoot anyone

1268
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:26,190
How can we fight this war
with screw ups like you?

1269
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:29,280
What happen to contact with
the headquarters?

1270
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,570
I'm still trying, sir

1271
01:51:32,110 --> 01:51:36,200
How can we hold out for
72 hours with those losers!

1272
01:51:36,330 --> 01:51:37,990
Send my brother home!

1273
01:51:40,250 --> 01:51:43,750
My former commander
promised to

1274
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:46,340
What kind of
bullshit is this?

1275
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:50,800
You earn a damn medal and
your brother is discharged?

1276
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:52,840
You only have to report it

1277
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:54,300
I don't believe this!

1278
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:58,890
I don't give a shit
what he promised you!

1279
01:51:59,430 --> 01:52:03,060
You think this is
a business deal or something?

1280
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:04,900
He started it

1281
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:07,400
How dare you talk back?

1282
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:09,610
Think of what you've done!

1283
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:11,780
Lock him up!

1284
01:52:11,950 --> 01:52:14,200
What a waste of Medals!

1285
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:17,280
Urgent message
from the 1 st company!

1286
01:52:17,410 --> 01:52:19,080
Put him in the cell!

1287
01:52:33,930 --> 01:52:37,970
I don't give a shit about
the order. Just retreat!

1288
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:42,390
I'll take responsibility
All companies, retreat!

1289
01:52:42,730 --> 01:52:44,480
God damn!

1290
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:47,810
- Open the cell
- You're crazy!

1291
01:52:47,940 --> 01:52:49,320
Give the order!

1292
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:52,070
Those commies will
kill you first

1293
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:53,900
I only want my brother out

1294
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:57,490
Not until we finish examining
your heads first

1295
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:03,370
Give the order, Now!

1296
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:07,500
One more thing...
the hostages...

1297
01:53:07,830 --> 01:53:08,880
Burn them!

1298
01:53:14,010 --> 01:53:15,930
- Change that order!
- Put the gun away

1299
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:18,890
- I said, change the order!
- This is an order, Remove the gun!

1300
01:53:18,890 --> 01:53:20,310
Change the order!

1301
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:24,810
Burn the warehouse down
it's an order!

1302
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:36,990
Medic! Medic!

1303
01:53:45,870 --> 01:53:47,000
Open the door!

1304
01:54:19,030 --> 01:54:20,490
Jin-seok...

1305
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:22,200
Jin-seok...

1306
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:27,430
Let go, you bastards
I'm the chief

1307
01:56:18,690 --> 01:56:22,570
Military Hospital, Tae-Jeon
South Korea, July 1951

1308
01:56:32,330 --> 01:56:34,500
Jin-seok!

1309
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:40,380
You look well

1310
01:56:41,050 --> 01:56:43,090
Thanks, You saved my life

1311
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:46,760
I thought I was dead
in that cell

1312
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:52,270
I did too when you got shot
as we were coming out

1313
01:56:52,390 --> 01:56:54,390
Someone up there likes you

1314
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:57,150
- When do you get out of here?
- Next week

1315
01:56:57,150 --> 01:57:01,570
How nice to be discharged!

1316
01:57:02,110 --> 01:57:04,910
I bet your mom needs your help

1317
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:09,990
This damn war should be over

1318
01:57:10,540 --> 01:57:14,250
The battle around the 38th
parallel is still bloody

1319
01:57:14,250 --> 01:57:19,670
Everyday so many lives are lost
but we can't take any ground

1320
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:25,180
I bought them on my way

1321
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,470
Thank you again

1322
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:33,390
And... your brother sent...

1323
01:57:33,810 --> 01:57:38,110
This letter home... but it was
returned to the camp

1324
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:39,900
You keep this

1325
01:57:42,820 --> 01:57:45,700
I doubt he retreated then

1326
01:57:45,820 --> 01:57:47,660
I've searched everywhere, but...

1327
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:49,370
I don't want to know

1328
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:53,370
- I don't care
- PFC Lee Jin-seok!

1329
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:55,540
You're wanted
in the counseling room

1330
01:57:55,540 --> 01:57:56,870
Thank you

1331
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:12,060
Our decorated hero
turned into a communist

1332
01:58:12,930 --> 01:58:17,270
It's a serious problem for us and
a good propaganda tool for them

1333
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:19,520
At first we didn't believe it

1334
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:22,270
But his fiancee was executed
as a communist

1335
01:58:22,270 --> 01:58:24,190
That must have affected him

1336
01:58:24,190 --> 01:58:27,150
He doesn't know what
communism or democracy is

1337
01:58:27,150 --> 01:58:30,410
Then how come he
turned into a communist!

1338
01:58:30,410 --> 01:58:34,240
He wouldn't have done this
If he thought of his family

1339
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:36,200
I suppose there must be a reason

1340
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:40,670
You, too are a suspect, unless
you give us a good explanation

1341
01:58:40,670 --> 01:58:42,840
I don't care about Jin-tae

1342
01:58:45,210 --> 01:58:49,470
The Jin-tae I knew was just
an innocent shoeshine boy...

1343
01:58:49,470 --> 01:58:52,800
who loved his family
especially his brother

1344
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:56,480
The one who's got the medal
and leads 'Flag unit'...

1345
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,100
He is not my brother

1346
01:59:00,810 --> 01:59:02,560
What happened to Jin-tae?

1347
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:04,270
I was questioned, too

1348
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:05,690
You had lunch?

1349
01:59:06,530 --> 01:59:08,450
How can you eat right now?

1350
01:59:08,450 --> 01:59:09,490
Unthinkable!

1351
01:59:09,610 --> 01:59:11,740
We expected him to
become a captive, but

1352
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:13,620
how can he become a communist?

1353
01:59:13,620 --> 01:59:17,540
After seeing his fiancee
shot to death and then...

1354
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:21,830
He must have thought that
you were killed in the fire

1355
01:59:22,420 --> 01:59:24,500
He loved you so much

1356
01:59:26,050 --> 01:59:27,880
I don't care about him

1357
01:59:29,220 --> 01:59:31,470
He's crazy about medals

1358
01:59:31,590 --> 01:59:34,260
they must have offered him
a good post!

1359
01:59:34,260 --> 01:59:36,770
Maybe the damn commies

1360
01:59:36,890 --> 01:59:38,980
Offered him a better post!

1361
01:59:39,020 --> 01:59:40,270
You see?

1362
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:19,890
Dear Mother
I miss you every day

1363
02:00:20,730 --> 02:00:23,480
Please stay well until
we get back

1364
02:00:23,730 --> 02:00:26,980
And don't worry about Jin-seok
I will definitely keep Jin-seok safe

1365
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:31,280
War is tough but Jin-seok
is doing fine, don't worry

1366
02:00:31,950 --> 02:00:34,990
Please say hello
to Young-shin

1367
02:00:35,990 --> 02:00:39,040
When I'm back home

1368
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:41,710
I'll make you happier
I promise

1369
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:45,130
Be careful in this
cold weather

1370
02:00:45,330 --> 02:00:47,630
It's very cold

1371
02:00:47,790 --> 02:00:49,840
Take care of yourself, mom

1372
02:01:44,770 --> 02:01:47,690
All these patients came from

1373
02:01:47,850 --> 02:01:50,270
the battle near
the 38th parallel

1374
02:01:50,270 --> 02:01:52,820
Your are crazy
to go back there

1375
02:01:53,150 --> 02:01:55,740
How can you be sure that
you'll even find him?

1376
02:01:55,740 --> 02:02:00,030
You'll be discharged in a week
Think about your mom!

1377
02:02:00,660 --> 02:02:02,790
Please listen to me, Jin-seok!

1378
02:02:02,790 --> 02:02:04,040
See you soon

1379
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:08,080
You've to take care of
Young-shin's brother and sisters!

1380
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:10,290
Jin-seok!
PFC LEE Jin-seok!

1381
02:02:13,050 --> 02:02:14,840
Take care, you bastard!

1382
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:32,400
We attack up the middle of hills
931 and 851 dividing them

1383
02:02:32,570 --> 02:02:40,070
Then battalions 1 and 2 flank
the hills from both directions

1384
02:02:40,870 --> 02:02:43,490
As I said before
in this strategy

1385
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:45,120
We have to take out

1386
02:02:45,250 --> 02:02:47,410
'Flag unit' at all costs!

1387
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:49,960
Don't forget we've moved
the operation up 1 day

1388
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:50,630
A question?

1389
02:02:50,630 --> 02:02:52,790
When will PFC Lee join the mission?

1390
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:54,710
He'll sit this one out

1391
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:57,970
Since the Americans
moved the attack up 24 hours

1392
02:02:57,970 --> 02:02:59,300
there's no time

1393
02:02:59,630 --> 02:03:02,220
He'll speak over
the microphone

1394
02:03:05,470 --> 02:03:07,350
- Sir!
- What is it?

1395
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:09,560
I'm LEE Jin-tae's brother

1396
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:12,520
It's an honor to meet
the brother of the traitor!

1397
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:14,320
Unless he sees me, he won't
believe it's me

1398
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:15,440
I have to go

1399
02:03:15,610 --> 02:03:17,650
We start the attack
in an hour

1400
02:03:17,650 --> 02:03:19,650
There's not enough time

1401
02:03:19,780 --> 02:03:22,950
If he sees I am alive
he'll come back for sure!

1402
02:03:22,950 --> 02:03:25,410
- Please let me go
- Out of the question!

1403
02:03:25,410 --> 02:03:28,250
Sir, please!

1404
02:03:28,370 --> 02:03:30,080
Answer me one question

1405
02:03:30,170 --> 02:03:33,460
Is this for your country
or your brother?

1406
02:03:33,670 --> 02:03:36,630
Just read the script
over the speaker

1407
02:03:39,090 --> 02:03:40,840
40 minutes to go!

1408
02:03:40,970 --> 02:03:44,550
No enemy movements
detected, sir!

1409
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:47,350
F-86 Sabres are standing

1410
02:03:47,470 --> 02:03:49,850
by Artillery units
are standing by

1411
02:03:49,850 --> 02:03:51,480
- Loyalty!
- Loyalty!

1412
02:03:51,690 --> 02:03:53,520
- Where is the script?
- It's not been delivered yet

1413
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:56,440
We thought the Headquarters
would give it to us

1414
02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:57,730
Wait a moment

1415
02:04:04,660 --> 02:04:09,620
Check personal arms, a dagger
grenades, extra magazines

1416
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:12,790
- To position!
- To position!

1417
02:04:12,790 --> 02:04:16,500
- One, two, four, eight, six
- one, two, four...

1418
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:20,010
931 Highland
move military power

1419
02:04:22,090 --> 02:04:25,100
K-9 Osan first arrival formation
landing begun

1420
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:28,930
Military power and all present
stationing complete

1421
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:40,940
Sir, PFC Lee is running
toward the enemy unit

1422
02:04:52,870 --> 02:04:55,130
- What's going on?
- He just surrendered

1423
02:04:55,130 --> 02:04:57,960
What?
Surrendered?

1424
02:05:01,300 --> 02:05:04,220
If you lie, you're dead
Why are you here?

1425
02:05:04,220 --> 02:05:06,300
I came here to see my brother

1426
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:08,350
The leader of 'Flag unit'

1427
02:05:08,470 --> 02:05:10,970
- What!
- Please let me see him

1428
02:05:11,060 --> 02:05:13,560
I'll kill you
if you're lying

1429
02:05:14,350 --> 02:05:15,020
Check it out

1430
02:05:15,020 --> 02:05:19,440
A yellow dog is here saying
he's the brother of mother owl

1431
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:20,860
Confirm

1432
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:23,280
- Let me talk to him!
- Confirm

1433
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:25,740
- He doesn't know I'm alive!
- Shut up!

1434
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:28,450
Negative
Says his brother is dead

1435
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:30,660
Please, let me talk!

1436
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:33,960
Jin-tae, it's me
Jin-seok!

1437
02:05:34,790 --> 02:05:38,630
You're a damn spy
What's your mission?

1438
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:43,130
Spit it out before
I blow your head off!

1439
02:05:43,130 --> 02:05:44,720
Let me talk to him

1440
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:46,090
He'll know it's me

1441
02:05:46,090 --> 02:05:47,260
Stop screwing with me!

1442
02:05:47,260 --> 02:05:49,930
- I'm begging you!
- What are you here for!

1443
02:05:49,930 --> 02:05:52,430
- Oh, please!
- Speak up!

1444
02:05:52,770 --> 02:05:54,940
- I'm begging you
- Sir!

1445
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:59,820
We've got an order to
bring him to the security unit

1446
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:03,070
Get him out of here!

1447
02:06:04,190 --> 02:06:08,160
Dearfellow North Korean citizens
despite months of struggle

1448
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:10,910
our army is stil
holding on strong

1449
02:06:11,950 --> 02:06:15,870
- How far away is 'Flag unit'?
- Ask the security!

1450
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:20,130
Reckless behavior will

02:09:30,650 --> 02:09:33,740
Fix bayonet! Fix bayonet!

1456
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:52,170
Where the hell are you going?

1457
02:09:53,170 --> 02:09:55,340
He's a dog from the south!

1458
02:10:56,610 --> 02:10:59,160
It's 'Flag unit'!

1459
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:23,470
I'm gonna kill you, you crybaby

1460
02:11:52,420 --> 02:11:55,380
Kill 'em all!

1461
02:12:40,050 --> 02:12:41,380
Son of a bitch!

1462
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:11,500
Jin-tae!

1463
02:13:21,050 --> 02:13:23,260

1467
02:13:30,970 --> 02:13:32,180
Jin-tae!

1468
02:14:06,130 --> 02:14:08,720
Jin-tae, please!
Please, brother!

1469
02:14:32,700 --> 02:14:33,830
Jin-tae!

1470
02:15:24,420 --> 02:15:26,090
Sons of bitches!

1471
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:29,890
You South Korean piece of shit!

1472
02:15:30,050 --> 02:15:33,260
- Jin-tae, please!
- State guard bastards!

1473
02:15:33,260 --> 02:15:35,350
Please come to your senses!

1474
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:39,060
Look at me, I am Jin-seok
your only brother!

1475
02:15:39,230 --> 02:15:41,860
- Die!

1476
02:15:42,020 --> 02:15:46,690
Die, all you pieces of shit!

1477
02:15:47,030 --> 02:15:48,650
- Retreat!
- Bastards

1478
02:15:48,700 --> 02:15:49,950
Retreat!

1479
02:15:53,580 --> 02:15:55,330
State guard bastards...

1480
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:22,100
Jin-tae, get up!

1481
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:31,410
You have to come with me!

1482
02:16:33,030 --> 02:16:35,200
Let's go, we have no time!

1483
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:40,000
Bro, get up! We have to go!
We have to go now!

1484
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,170
We have to get out of here

1485
02:16:42,750 --> 02:16:45,090
Please, get up!

1486
02:16:48,300 --> 02:16:51,170
Don't you think of mom?

1487
02:16:55,010 --> 02:16:59,600
You have to take care of
Young-shin's grave!

1488
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:05,770
You promised many things!

1489
02:17:05,900 --> 02:17:08,070
You can't die here!

1490
02:17:08,610 --> 02:17:16,990
You have to live to see me
go to college, come on!

1491
02:17:24,790 --> 02:17:27,460
- Jin-seok?
- Jin-tae!

1492
02:17:28,590 --> 02:17:33,050
You're really alive

1493
02:17:43,690 --> 02:17:45,190
Go!

1494
02:17:45,980 --> 02:17:48,440
No, Jin-tae!
I won't go alone

1495
02:17:48,610 --> 02:17:51,320
- Just go
- No way!

1496
02:17:51,490 --> 02:17:54,860
- Get up and come with me
- Listen

1497
02:17:54,990 --> 02:17:58,490
I will surrender and
come home after the war

1498
02:17:58,870 --> 02:18:02,250
I was making shoes I'd give
to you when you go to college

1499
02:18:02,250 --> 02:18:06,040
I haven't finished them
so I won't die, Hurry!

1500
02:18:09,090 --> 02:18:12,960
- I won't!
- I am okay

1501
02:18:13,090 --> 02:18:15,050
- Do as I told you, go!
- I wont' go without you

1502
02:18:15,050 --> 02:18:17,340
- Go!
- Let's go, we must go together

1503
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:19,430
Then both of us will die

1504
02:18:19,470 --> 02:18:21,560
- No!
- Listen to me!

1505
02:18:23,980 --> 02:18:26,940
Look at me, Believe me

1506
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:35,450
I found this after the fire

1507
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:45,660
Give it to me...
when we meet again

1508
02:18:48,500 --> 02:18:51,170
You have to come back...

1509
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:53,710
You have to come back!

1510
02:21:29,290 --> 02:21:34,460
You promised... to come back
and finish the shoes...

1511
02:21:37,090 --> 02:21:39,340
But what are you doing here?

1512
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:45,760
I've waited for so long!

1513
02:21:47,760 --> 02:21:50,100
What happened to your promise?

1514
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:51,980
Say something!

1515
02:21:52,980 --> 02:21:55,350
Please say something...

1516
02:21:58,270 --> 02:22:01,400
I've been waiting to see
for 50 years!

1517
02:22:01,860 --> 02:22:04,910
Please say something

1518
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:12,120
I shouldn't have left
you alone back then!

1519
02:22:14,580 --> 02:22:15,960
Jin-tae...

1520
02:22:17,580 --> 02:22:18,590
Jin-tae!

1521
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:28,200
Jin-seok!

1522
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:31,120
Jin-seok!

1523
02:24:13,740 --> 02:24:16,700
Jin-seok
Let's go to get some water

1524
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:19,330
Let's go to get some water

1525
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:22,290
Let's go to get some water

1526
02:24:23,290 --> 02:24:24,540
Go!

1527
02:24:27,260 --> 02:24:31,300
How have you been?

1528
02:24:32,550 --> 02:24:35,810
We are going back
to school, y'know

1529
02:24:35,930 --> 02:24:39,520
- School?
- I can't wait to go to school

1530
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:44,310
- How about you?
- Me too, of course
