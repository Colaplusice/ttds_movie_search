00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,500
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

3
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,800
<i>We clear on that?</i>

4
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,900
<i>This is a live project.
You're a go.</i>

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,200
<i>You're a go.</i>

6
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,800
<i>Training is over.
Training is over.</i>

7
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,300
I'm okay. It's fine.

8
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,100
Just a headache.

9
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,200
<i>You're burning up.</i>

10
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,300
It's okay.

11
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,900
Just a headache.

12
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Anything new?
No.

13
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,900
It's just bits and pieces.

14
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,700
I can hear Conklin's voice,

15
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,800
And there's that photograph, but...

16
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,000
I just can't stay with it.

17
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,300
But you're sure it's not
just a bad dream? It happened.

18
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,700
It was a mission.

19
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,900
And I was there.

20
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,100
You should write it down.

21
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,500
Two years we're scribbling in that
notebook... it hasn't been two years.

22
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,900
It's always bad, and now it's just
the same thing over and over again.

23
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,400
But that's why we write it down.
Because sooner or later, you remember something good.

24
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,700
I do remember something good.

25
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,900
All the time.

26
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,600
<i>I want one final go around.
All teams listen up.</i>

27
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,500
<i>- We are standing by for final green.
- Survey two, I need to know when you've got eyes.</i>

28
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,900
<i>This is survey two. I have eyes.
- Copy that.</i>

29
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,300
<i>Survey one, this is hub.
Do you have visual contact?</i>

30
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,800
<i>Hub, this is survey one.
Mobile one is in motion.</i>

31
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,800
<i>Survey three, that is good.</i>

32
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,700
Hub.
Director marshall from langley.

33
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,500
- Langley.
- Stand by, please.

34
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,600
<i>- Martin?
- I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller.</i>

35
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,300
We understand you're using
the full allocation for this buy.

36
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,500
It's where we came out.
It's a lot of money, Pam.

37
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,400
For a thief, a mole. If it does nothing more than narrow
the list of suspects, it's a bargain at 10 times the price.

38
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,700
<i>Hub, this is survey two.
Escort is breaking off.</i>

39
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,400
<i>Mobile one is entering the building.</i>

40
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,600
Gentlemen, I have the seller on-site and in play.
Quite frankly, there's nothing much more to discuss.

41
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,000
- All right, Pam. Your call.
- Go.

42
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,100
<i>- We're on.
Audio contact only.</i>

43
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,100
<i>Switching to channel one now.</i>

44
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,000
<i>Copy that. It's affirmative.</i>

45
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,500
You have it?

46
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,000
I have it.

47
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,200
<i>Hub, mobile one and seller
have entered the office.</i>

48
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,700
Copy that.

49
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,000
Everything is there.
These files will prove who stole you your money.

50
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,500
<i>This is everything?</i>

51
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,300
<i>Those were shots.</i>

52
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,200
Survey one, come in. Survey one, I need
to know what happened. What do you see?

53
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,300
<i>- Do you see any shadows? I see nothing.
- What is your visual?</i>

54
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,300
<i>- Get some men in there. Get some men in there right now.
- Pull it up, Kurt.</i>

55
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,600
<i>Eye contact. I don't care if it's visual...
mobile one, can you copy, please?</i>

56
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,600
- Are you there, mobile one?
- I'm sorry.

57
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,200
<i>What do you see?</i>

58
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,300
...petroleum association's annual
conference here in Berlin...

59
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Is pekos oil chief executive officer
Yuri Gretkov.

60
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,000
<i>In just six years, gretkov has turned
pekos into an oil empire, which in turn...</i>

61
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,500
He's become one of
the wealthiest men in Russia...

62
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,100
After consolidating drilling rights in the
caspian sea and gaining control of one of the wo...

63
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,300
You are late.

64
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,400
Files.

65
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,100
You will have the remainder when you finish the job.

66
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,300
I must clean up first time.

67
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Quickly, your plane leaves in one hour.

68
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,300
Are you sure that the information is correct?

69
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,800
It will be there.

70
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,600
How much?

71
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,200
Good morning, sir.
Morning.

72
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,800
He is my friend.
There's been a death in the family.

73
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,000
I wonder if you've seen him.

74
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,400
- Hey.
- Get in.

75
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,400
<i>- What's wrong?
- We're blown.</i>

76
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
How? We pushed it. We got lazy.

77
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,100
<i>Idiot!</i>

78
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,800
- All right. That's twice now
I've seen the same guy.

79
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
I saw him in town.
He was at the telegraph office.

80
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,200
Are you sure? How-How can
you be sure? It's just wrong.

81
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,200
The guy, the car he's driving,
what he's wearing... it's just wrong.

82
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,000
<i>Look, Jason, let's stay calm. It
could be anybody. This is real.</i>

83
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,700
This is real. That's him.
That's him right there.

84
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,700
<i>- Get your head down.
Silver Hyundai. Get your head down.</i>

85
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,200
How far is he?

86
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
How far?

87
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,000
A hundred meters.

88
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,900
Here, take the wheel.
You're gonna drive.

89
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,800
Switch.

90
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Just head to the bridge.

91
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,700
<i>- Turn here. Cut through the field.
- Hang on.</i>

92
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,600
All right, you keep going to the shack.
I'll meet you there in one hour.

93
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm gonna bail out on the other side of this
bridge. It's the only way he can follow us.

94
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,400
What if it's not who you think
it is? It's them. It's Treadstone.

95
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,000
Jason, don't do it.
Look, marie, I warned 'em.

96
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,400
I don't want you to do it. I told them what
would happen if they didn't leave us alone.

97
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,100
- It's never gonna be over like this. I don't want...
- We don't have a choice.

98
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,100
Yes, you do.

99
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,800
Thank you.

100
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,800
Two of these explosive charges placed on
the power lines, and one of them failed.

101
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,000
The fingerprints from the one
that didn't go off.

102
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,200
<i>And the germans can't match it?
No. Nobody's got it.</i>

103
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,600
<i>We checked out every database we could
access. But we're hooked into Langley now.</i>

104
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,000
Run it.
Okay.

105
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,300
What the hell's Treadstone?

106
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,900
All right. Get me a flight.
We're going to Langley.

107
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,400
It is done.

108
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Are sure for you that he died?

109
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,200
Because there is no room for--

110
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,900
It is done. Bourne.
The files. The fingerprint.

111
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,800
I will make contact with
you in one month.

112
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Two men dead, three million
in cash gone, no Neski files,

113
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,300
<i>And all very public.</i>

114
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,500
This is still a clandestine agency, no?

115
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
I don't view this event
as a failure.

116
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,300
You call it a success?
We have a lead.

117
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,400
A fingerprint left by the assassin.
He's one of us.

118
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,800
- Who is it?
- What can you tell me about Treadstone?

119
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,900
Treadstone?
It's where the trail dead-ends.

120
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,900
If you want an answer,
you're going to have to give me...

121
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,200
A level-five S.C.I. Access.

122
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,700
We have a lead, marty.

123
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,900
All right.
You've got your clearance.

124
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,600
But you're on
a very short leash.

125
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,700
And you'll give a full report to the group.
I wanna know where you're going with this.

126
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,400
Sir.

127
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,300
<i>Ward?</i>

128
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,000
Yes?
Pamela Landy.

129
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,500
Hey, Pam.
What can I do for you?

130
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,000
I was hoping you had some
time for me. Time for what?

131
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:31,400
- I'm free right now, actually.
- That sounds ominous. Let me check my schedule.

132
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,400
<i>Excuse me. I need to, uh...
excuse me. Can I help you?</i>

133
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,800
<i>Yeah, I'm here to see mr. Abbott.
Twenty minutes?</i>

134
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,700
See ya.

135
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,900
Operation Treadstone.
Never heard of it.

136
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,700
That's not gonna fly. With all due respect, Pam,
i think you might've wandered past your pay grade.

137
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,400
That's a warrant from director marshall
granting me unrestricted access to...

138
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,500
<i>All personnel and materials
associated with Treadstone.</i>

139
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,000
So, what are we looking at?
I wanna know about it.

140
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,100
Know about it? It was a
kill squad. Black-On-Black.

141
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,600
We closed it down two years ago. Nobody wants
to know about Treadstone. Not around here.

142
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,400
<i>So I think you better take this back to marty
and let him know exactly what you're doing.</i>

143
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,600
He does. I've been down to the
archives. I have the files, ward.

144
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,100
<i>- Let's talk about Conklin.
- What are you after, Pam?</i>

145
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,700
You wanna fry me?
You want my desk. Is that it?

146
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,600
I wanna know what happened.
What happened?

147
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,600
Jason Bourne happened. You got
the files. Then let's cut the crap.

148
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,700
<i>Conklin had these guys wound so tight,
they were bound to snap.</i>

149
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
<i>Bourne was his number-One. The guy went
for a job, screwed the op, never came back.</i>

150
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,200
<i>Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find
Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways.</i>

151
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,500
So you had Conklin killed?
I mean, if we're cutting the crap.

152
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,100
I've given 30 years
and two marriages to this agency.

153
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,000
I've shoveled shit on four continents.
I'm due to retire next year.

154
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,100
But if you think I'm gonna sit here
and let you dangle me with this,

155
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,700
You can go to hell... and marshall too.

156
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,400
<i>It had to be done.</i>

157
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,300
<i>And Bourne? Where is he now?
- Dead in a ditch.</i>

158
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,100
<i>- Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu. Who knows?
- I think I do.</i>

159
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,600
<i>I had a deal going down
in Berlin last week.</i>

160
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,300
<i>During the buy, both our case officer
and the seller were killed.</i>

161
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,400
They were killed by Jason Bourne.

162
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,700
They're ready for us upstairs.

163
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:22,000
Seven years ago, $20 million of C.I.A. funds
disappeared during a wire transfer through Moscow.

164
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:27,500
In the investigation that followed, we were
contacted by a russian politician, Vladimir Neski.

165
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Neski claimed we had a leak and that
we'd been ripped off by one of our own.

166
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,000
And were we?
We never found out.

167
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,400
We were negotiating a meet
with mr. Neski when he was killed.

168
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
- By who?
- His wife.

169
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,100
<i>The case had gone cold until a month ago
when we found a source.</i>

170
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,800
Another russian in Berlin who claimed
to have access to the neski murder files.

171
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,000
<i>We thought we had
another bite at the apple.</i>

172
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,400
<i>Turns out the assassin
was one of our own... Jason Bourne.</i>

173
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,700
<i>I know Treadstone's not
a very popular subject around here,</i>

174
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,300
But we found some interesting things
when we dug a little deeper.

175
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,800
This is Conklin's personal computer.

176
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:10,300
<i>His Treadstone files are bloated with code keys and
case files that he neither needed nor had clearance for.</i>

177
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Buried in the hard drive, we found a deleted
file with an account number to a bank in zurich.

178
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:20,200
<i>At the time ofhis death, he was sitting on a
personal account in the amount of $ 760,000.</i>

179
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,000
You know what his budget was? We were throwing
money at him and asking him to keep it dark.

180
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,100
- It was his own account. He was up to something.
- This is supposed to be definitive?

181
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,100
<i>What's definitive is that I just lost two
people in Berlin. So what's your theory?</i>

182
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,700
Conklin's reaching out from the grave to
protect his good name? The man is dead.

183
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,000
- No one's disputing that, ward.
- For christ's sake, marty, you knew Conklin.

184
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,100
Does this scan? I mean, at all?

185
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,100
Cut to the chase, Pam.

186
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,500
<i>I think that Bourne and Conklin
were in business together,</i>

187
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,700
That Bourne's still involved and that whatever
information I was trying to buy in Berlin...

188
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Was big enough to bring Bourne
out from hiding to kill again.

189
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,000
How's that scan?

190
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,900
<i>Excuse me, sir,
but you're not gonna believe this.</i>

191
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Jason Bourne's passport
just popped up on the grid in naples.

192
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,100
Okay. Contact naples. They need
to know who they're dealing with.

193
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,900
Find out what kind of local assets
we have in place there.

194
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Nah, it's nothing. Some guy's name
came up on the computer.

195
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,900
Yeah. Hey, listen, tom,
I'm gonna call you back, okay?

196
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,300
All right.

197
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,100
Mr. Bourne, I'm John Nevins.
I'm with the U.S. Consulate.

198
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,600
I just have a few questions for you.

199
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,600
You're coming out oftangier.
Is that correct?

200
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,300
What's the, uh, nature
of your visit to naples?

201
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,000
Look, I don't know what you did, and
i don't know who you're working for.

202
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,000
But I promise you this...

203
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,000
You're gonna play ball
one way or the other.

204
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,900
This is nevins.

205
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,100
This is tom cronin, C.I. Operations officer
calling from Langley, Virginia.

206
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,600
- Do you have a Jason Bourne in custody?
- Yes, I do.

207
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,400
Listen, he's an agency priority target.

208
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,300
Call me back as soon as
he's secure. I understand.

209
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,800
He's been detained.
Here's the number.

210
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,900
<i>- He's being interrogated by
a field officer out of the consulate.</i>

211
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,200
- Hello.
- This is Pamela Landy, C.I. Supervisor.

212
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,900
<i>Where do we stand?</i>

213
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,800
I, uh, think he got away.

214
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,600
Damn it.

215
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,300
- Have you locked down the area?
- Locked it down? No. No.

216
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,400
This is, uh... this is italy.
They don't exactly lock down...

217
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,900
- How long have you worked for the agency?
- Me? For four years.

218
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,800
<i>If you ever wanna make it to five, you're gonna listen
to me real close. Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

219
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,200
Last week in Berlin he assassinated two
men... one a highly experienced field officer.

220
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,500
I want you to secure that area. I want any
evidence secured, and I want it done right now.

221
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,900
Is that clear?
Yes, sir... ma'am.

222
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,400
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes,
which means you're gonna call me back in 30.

223
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,100
<i>And when I ask you where we stand,
i had better be impressed.</i>

224
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,000
- Berlin?
- I already have a team in place there.

225
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,700
<i>I doubt that Bourne's in naples
ready to start a family.</i>

226
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,400
<i>- You have no idea what you're getting into.
- Do you have any idea?</i>

227
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,800
<i>From the minute he left Treadstone, he's killed and
eluded every single person that you've sent to find him.</i>

228
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,400
You read a couple of files on Jason Bourne, and
that makes you an expert? This is my case, ward.

229
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,100
<i>Enough. I want you both
on that plane.</i>

230
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,400
<i>We are, all of us, going to do what we were either
too lazy or inept to do the last time around.</i>

231
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,600
We're gonna find this son of a bitch
and take him down.

232
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,300
I'm not having Jason Bourne
destroy any more of this agency.

233
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,300
- Is that definitive enough for you?
- Yes.

234
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,000
<i>Jason Bourne
is armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

235
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,800
<i>Last week in Berlin he assassinated two
men... one a highly experienced field officer.</i>

236
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,600
I want that area...

237
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,300
<i>...he assassinated two men...
one a highly experienced field officer.</i>

238
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,100
<i>I want that area secured. I want any evidence
secured, and I want it done right now...</i>

239
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,600
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

240
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,100
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.
This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

241
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,000
<i>We clear on that?
We clear on that?</i>

242
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,300
<i>You'd been working at Treadstone
for three years,</i>

243
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
<i>And your cover at the time was what?</i>

244
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,100
That I was an american student in paris.

245
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,100
And what exactly did your job
with Treadstone in paris consist of?

246
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,900
<i>I had two responsibilities. One was
to coordinate logistical operations.</i>

247
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,200
The other was to monitor
the health of the agents.

248
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,700
<i>Health, meaning what?
Their mental health.</i>

249
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,700
- Because of what they had been through, they were prone to a variety of problems.
- What kind?

250
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,800
Depression, anger,
compulsive behaviors.

251
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,800
They had physical symptoms.
Headaches, sensitivity to light.

252
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,200
- Amnesia?
- Before Bourne? No.

253
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,600
The plane's ready.
There's a car waiting for you.

254
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,700
- Good luck.
- No. You were his local contact.

255
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,300
You were with him the night Conklin died.
You're coming with us.

256
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,600
- Langley pulled an image out of naples.
It's uploading right now.

257
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,500
It's coming in now.

258
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,400
<i>I need clearance.
- He's not hiding, that's for sure.</i>

259
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,900
- Why naples? Why now?
- Could be random.

260
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,100
- Maybe he's running.
- On his own passport?

261
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,800
- What is he actually doing?
- He's making his first mistake.

262
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,600
It's not a mistake.

263
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,200
They don't make mistakes.
They don't do random.

264
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,700
There's always an objective.
Always a target.

265
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,300
<i>The objective and targets always came
from us. Who's giving them to him now?</i>

266
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,700
Scary version?

267
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,100
He is.

268
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,000
- I emptied it.
- It felt a little light.

269
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,700
Put it down.

270
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
- Front.
- Sorry. Old habits.

271
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,000
Use your teeth.
Ah.

272
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,600
Word in the ether was
you'd lost your memory.

273
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,700
You still should've moved.

274
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,500
- What do you want?
- Conklin.

275
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,500
He's dead.

276
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,300
Shot dead in paris. Dead the night you
walked out. So who's running Treadstone now?

277
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,000
Nobody. They shut it down.

278
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,100
It's over. We're the last two.

279
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,200
If it's over,
then why are they still after me?

280
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,900
- I don't know.
- Ever heard the name Pamela Landy?

281
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,200
- I don't know who that is.
- Pamela Landy and Berlin. What's going on in Berlin?

282
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,100
<i>I don't know.</i>

283
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,700
Why would I lie?

284
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,400
I thought you were here to kill me.

285
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,200
What'd you do?
I'm sorry.

286
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,300
Did you call it in?

287
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,300
Get up. Come on.

288
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,800
You have a car out front? The
keys are in my coat pocket.

289
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,800
But we should...
what?

290
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,300
<i>- Go out the back.
I have another car.</i>

291
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,400
Pamela Landy.

292
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,100
<i>Nein, mein herr.
Danke.</i>

293
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,500
Pamela Landy.

294
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,900
<i>Nein.</i>

295
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,900
<i>Pamela Landy, bitte.</i>

296
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,600
<i>Ja.</i>

297
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,400
Pamela Landy, please.
One moment, please.

298
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,200
Thank you.

299
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,200
I wanted to call a guest.
Pamela Landy.

300
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,200
<i>Just one second, please.</i>

301
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,400
Hello?

302
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,500
Hello?

303
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:13,300
I'm sorry, sir. The phone's busy
right now. Just try later. Thank you.

304
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,200
<i>Okay. Let's take a look at the timeline.
What's Bourne's objective?</i>

305
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,900
<i>Now, I wanna break this out
in boxes.</i>

306
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,900
<i>Naples outbound. Check everything. Flights,
trains, police reports. That's box one.</i>

307
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,700
- Teddy, that's yours.
- Got it.

308
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,400
<i>Box number two.
Call it 'prior connections. "</i>

309
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,200
I want to rerun all Bourne's
Treadstone material. Every footstep.

310
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,600
<i>Kim, box three.
I want to identify his method of travel.</i>

311
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,200
<i>Stay on the local cops. We need a
vehicle, a parking ticket, something.</i>

312
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,900
Langley's offered to upload any satellite
imaging we need, so let's find a target for them.

313
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,600
<i>Danny, box four. I need fresh eyes. Review
the buy where we lost the Neski files.</i>

314
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,300
Timeline it with what we know about Bourne's
movements. Turn it upside down and see what we find.

315
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,400
<i>Come on, guys. We ran this guy's life with total control
for all those years. We should be a step ahead ofhim.</i>

316
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,100
You wanna go home?
Find Jason Bourne.

317
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,900
- Pamela Landy.
- This is Jason Bourne.

318
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,500
<i>- Bourne?
- It's Bourne. We need 90 seconds to triangulate his position.</i>

319
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,000
What do you want?

320
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,800
Are you running Treadstone?

321
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,100
Treadstone was closed down
two years ago. You know that.

322
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,800
Then who's planning
the missions now?

323
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,200
There are no missions. It's over.

324
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,100
- Then what do you want with me?
- Berlin.

325
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,500
Have you forgotten
what happened in Berlin?

326
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,200
<i>You killed two people, Bourne.
You killed two people, Bourne.</i>

327
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,900
<i>You killed two people, Bourne.</i>

328
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,100
<i>- Neski... Vladimir Neski...
Vladimir Neski...</i>

329
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,700
Bourne?

330
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,200
<i>I wanna come in.</i>

331
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,400
<i>- Okay. How do you wanna do it?
- We need 35 seconds.</i>

332
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,200
- I need someone I know to bring me in.
- Who?

333
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,200
<i>There was a girl in paris.
She was part of the program.</i>

334
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,700
<i>She used to handle logistics. Alexander
Strasse, 30 minutes, under the world clock.</i>

335
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,900
<i>Send her alone.
Give her your phone.</i>

336
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,600
What if I can't find her?

337
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,800
It's easy.
She's standing right next to you.

338
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,300
- There's just so many areas...
- It's a very simple layout.

339
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,300
<i>Get the second quadrant.
Pull it out.</i>

340
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,800
<i>Where is it? Get the second quadrant,
please. Pull it all the way up.</i>

341
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,600
<i>Clock is right here...
shit, he's put her in the middle of everything.</i>

342
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,600
This is a security nightmare. There is
no way we are going to get her covered...

343
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:23,600
Call a mayday into Berlin station. We
need snipers, D.O.D., whatever they've got.

344
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,800
No snipers. You put snipers on the roof
and it'll scare him off, and I need answers.

345
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:32,000
- You can't really believe he wants to come in.
- He knows something about the neski case.

346
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,900
- I'm not gonna pass up this chance to find out what it is.
- Don't be a fool. Not when we're this close.

347
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,100
Are we talking about protecting Nicky
or killing Bourne?

348
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,200
- We're talking about killing Bourne.
- We're talking about the next dead body. It might be nicky. It will be someone.

349
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,600
You're not hearing me.
Bourne dead gives me nothing.

350
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,800
Can I talk to you privately?

351
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,800
- What?
- I know how you're feeling.

352
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,500
You lost two men in Berlin
and you want it to mean something.

353
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,500
But nothing Bourne gives you
will bring your men back.

354
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:09,000
Nothing in those files makes their
sacrifice worthwhile. You have to let go.

355
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:12,700
We're professionals.
When an operation goes bad, we tie it off.

356
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,900
If there's something you're not telling me, I want it
now before I send that girl out there. Do you understand?

357
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,200
You talk about this stuff
like you read it in a book.

358
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,600
What do you want to do?

359
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,300
Put the snipers in place.

360
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,600
If things go bad,
we take him out.

361
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,400
You got it.

362
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,100
Hub, this is survey one.
We have a crowd moving in.

363
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,400
<i>- It's some sort of protest march.
- I'm sorry. This is as close as I can get.</i>

364
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,400
<i>- Survey two, can you get in any closer?
- Kurt, make sure the south end is covered.</i>

365
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,500
<i>Roger. Affirmative. Copy that.</i>

366
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,200
Hello. There's a tram coming
towards you. Get on it.

367
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,100
- She's moving to the tram.
- Where's it going?

368
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,300
<i>The tram is going
to Alexanderplatz station.</i>

369
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,800
<i>Survey five, I can't see him.
I don't see him.</i>

370
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,300
<i>Hub, this is survey two,
she's getting on a tram.</i>

371
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,500
- She's getting on the tram.
- Zoom in on the tram.

372
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,200
<i>- Bourne's on the tram.
- I don't think he's on the tram.</i>

373
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,700
<i>He's on the tram.</i>

374
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,000
- Send them in to follow.
Tell them to keep their distance.

375
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
<i>Okay, delta, let's go.
Get on it.</i>

376
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:40,400
Come on. Let's go.

377
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,100
<i>- Tell her to hurry.
- There's nothing on the south side.</i>

378
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:02,200
Alexanderplatz station,
25 seconds.

379
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,600
<i>This is survey three. There's a lot of protesters
here. There's no way we can cover out there.</i>

380
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,400
- Get her out of there.
- Go! Delta, move! Now!

381
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:49,100
<i>- She's not here. She's gone.
- Goddamn it!</i>

382
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,400
<i>- They are not on the tram.
- He's one guy!</i>

383
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,700
<i>Jason, please don't hurt me.
What were my words?</i>

384
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,400
I said leave me alone,
leave me out of it.

385
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,900
I did. I swear. Jason, i
told them that I believed you.

386
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,400
I'm gonna ask you
some some simple questions.

387
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,200
You're gonna answer me honestly,
or I swear to god I'm gonna kill you.

388
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,000
- Delta, give me something.
- They're on it! They're on it!

389
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,300
Who's pamela landy?

390
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,800
<i>She's a task force chief.
- Is she running Treadstone?</i>

391
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,600
No, she's the deputy director.
Why is she trying to kill me?

392
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:22,700
<i>Last week an agency field officer tried
to make a buy off of one ofher ops.</i>

393
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,400
He was trying to sell out a mole or
something and you got to him before we did.

394
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,600
<i>- I killed him?
- You left a print.</i>

395
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,700
<i>There were partial prints that trace
back to Treadstone. They know it was you.</i>

396
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,500
<i>- That is insane.
- Why are you doing this? Why come back now?</i>

397
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,100
Landy will find...
Stop. Stop.

398
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,400
Last week I was 4,000 miles away
in India, watching Marie die.

399
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,400
<i>They came for me,
and they killed her instead.</i>

400
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,400
<i>This ends now.</i>

401
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,600
<i>Find her.</i>

402
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:59,600
- What do you people want with me?
Why are you trying to frame me?

403
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:03,400
- Please! I'm only here because of paris. Abbott dragged us...
- Abbott? Who's abbott?

404
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,500
Conklin's boss.
He-He shut down Treadstone.

405
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,300
Is he here in berlin?
Yes.

406
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,300
Did he run Treadstone?

407
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,500
Did he run Treadstone? Yes.
Conklin reported to him.

408
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,500
Please. Please, I swear...

409
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:18,600
What was landy buying? What kind of
files? Conklin... stuff on Conklin.

410
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,600
It was something to do
with a russian politician.

411
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,100
Neski. Wh-What? What
are you talking about?

412
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,900
<i>Training is over... training is over...
training is over...</i>

413
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,500
When... when was I here in Berlin?

414
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,500
What are you talking about? For
Treadstone. I did a job here.

415
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,400
When? No, you never
worked in Berlin before.

416
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,800
My first job. In berlin.
You know my file.

417
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,800
- You've never worked Berlin before.
- My first job!

418
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,500
No, your first assignment was
Geneva. You fucking people!

419
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,700
I swear! I swear!
I know I was here, nicky!

420
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,900
It's not in your file!
- I know I was here!

421
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,800
<i>No, I swear... oh, please.!</i>

422
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,200
Pam, I want to show you something.
It's Alexanderplatz.

423
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:27,100
<i>We got three levels, we got 15 tunnels.
They're all converging in a five-block radius.</i>

424
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,200
Over here, luftschulzbunker.
That was an old war shelter.

425
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,600
How many men are out there? Two coming down the back
stairs. The rest, they're fanned out for a search.

426
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,500
<i>- What's our security situation here?
- Where, "here"? The ground?</i>

427
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:39,500
<i>Here here. In the building. Check everything, and
recheck all the stairwells, hallways, everything.</i>

428
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,000
It's done.

429
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:46,500
<i>Okay, let's go public.
Release his photo to the Berlin police.</i>

430
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,900
- And check out his story about the girlfriend in India too.
- I'm on it.

431
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,700
You're in a big puddle of shit, Pamela,
and you don't have the shoes for it.

432
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,800
- He said he didn't know anything about Berlin.
- He knew that nicky was wearing a wire.

433
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,800
- Don't you think that was for our benefit?
- He didn't sound like a man in control to me.

434
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,100
<i>We know he was in Berlin.</i>

435
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,500
His mind is broken.
We broke it. And now...

436
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,600
What now? Terminate him? You've been
pushing that agenda ever since we got here.

437
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,200
- He also said you were running Treadstone. Should we believe that too?
- I'm convinced bourne knows something.

438
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,300
He knows that you're after him,

439
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:19,600
And in the interest of self-Preservation
you might start with that.

440
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,400
Check on those photos.
Have they gone out?

441
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,500
I need to show you
something.

442
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,600
All right, I finished my box work, but i
wanted to show you before I showed landy.

443
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,600
Came down here last night...

444
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,600
Because none of this
is making any sense.

445
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,100
I'm with you... conklin was a nut.
But a traitor?

446
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,900
I just can't get there.
What do you have, Danny?

447
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,400
All right, you put a four-gam Kel on here,
it's gonna take out power to the building.

448
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,700
You know that.

449
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:48,800
There were two charges that were supposed to go off
simultaneously. The second one, over here, didn't go off.

450
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:52,800
Now, first of all, this is nothing.
It's a sub-line for the breaker above.

451
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,300
And second, why put the charge
all the way down here?

452
01:01:55,300 --> 01:02:00,000
If you're good enough to get in here and handle the
gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.

453
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,000
Bourne would know.

454
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,600
It was staged?
Is it a slam dunk? No.

455
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:08,600
But what if somebody were trying to cover
their tracks by blaming conklin and bourne?

456
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,700
What if bourne didn't have
anything to do with this?

457
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,900
- Show me again.
- All right.

458
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,100
Well, you put...

459
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,200
<i>Pull over. He's getting out.</i>

460
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,500
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.
We clear on that?</i>

461
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:57,400
This is a live project,
and you're a go.

462
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,900
<i>I'll see you on the other side.</i>

463
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,500
- Good evening, sir. How can I help you?
- I want to get a room for the night.

464
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,600
Do you have a reservation?
No.

465
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:37,100
Actually, is room 645 available?
I've stayed there before.

466
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,900
<i>I'm sorry, sir. That room is
occupied. How about room 644?</i>

467
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,500
<i>It's right across the hall.</i>

468
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,500
<i>Sir?</i>

469
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:53,800
644?
That's fine. Thank you.

470
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,900
I just need your passport
and signature right here, please.

471
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,400
Have a nice night.

472
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,600
<i>Ja.</i>

473
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,800
<i>Berlin polizei.</i>

474
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,300
Where?
Brecker hotel.

475
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,200
Okay, we're there.
Take the van!

476
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,600
- Brecker? How far?
- About five or six minutes.

477
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,900
<i>Hi!</i>

478
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,900
Hey!

479
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,000
<i>Congratulations, soldier.</i>

480
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,500
Training is over.

481
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,800
<i>Polizei! Polizei!</i>

482
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,900
Go!

483
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,500
Black coat, possibly leather,
dark t-shirt, dark pants.

484
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:28,800
The cops out there wanna corral all the
guests together and check 'em out one by one.

485
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,000
That will really work.

486
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:34,100
What the hell's he doing here? Maybe
he just wanted to stay the night.

487
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,100
<i>Polizei!</i>

488
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,600
Polizei! Polizei!

489
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,000
<i>Polizei! Polizei!</i>

490
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,900
<i>Polizei! Polizei!</i>

491
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,600
They missed him?
Yeah, so far.

492
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,600
But they found Nicky. She's back
at the Westin. Bourne let her go.

493
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,400
He let her go?
Yeah.

494
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,800
Where's danny zorn? He ought to
head over there and debrief her.

495
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:27,800
Why did Bourne come here?

496
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:31,100
We don't know yet. Landy's
upstairs in one of the rooms.

497
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,600
<i>She said she'd call you
when she's done.</i>

498
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,300
Okay.

499
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:44,400
I think I'll, uh... take a cab
back to the hotel.

500
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,100
<i>So, the room he checked into
was across the hall.</i>

501
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,100
Mmm.

502
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,400
Why would he come in here?

503
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:08,100
What are you thinking? I
recognize this room from a photo.

504
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:13,100
There was a chalk outline right here
around the body of Vladimir Neski.

505
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,300
This is where
his wife killed him?

506
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,700
Do you still think
his wife killed him?

507
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,800
Guess he got out
through this window.

508
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:35,300
We just got word
from the berlin police.

509
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,200
They found Danny Zorn's body.

510
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:46,200
I want you two to stay on Bourne.
Check everything that's out there.

511
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,800
Call Abbott. Tell him to
wait for me in his hotel.

512
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,000
I'm coming to see him.

513
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,200
<i>- Da.
- It's me.</i>

514
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,200
They're onto Neski.

515
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,500
This is not a clean phone. They
can't prove anything without bourne.

516
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,500
Kill Bourne,
and you kill this investigation.

517
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:36,000
I'm afraid, ward, the time has
come for us to part company.

518
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,600
Listen, Yuri, you bought those oil leases
with 20 million in stolen C.I.A. Seed money.

519
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,100
You owe me.
I gave you your cut.

520
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,300
We both got rich.

521
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,500
I don't owe you anything.

522
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,100
The plan can still be salvaged.
Just get Bourne. You hear me?

523
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,100
He's still out there.
Now get him.

524
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,800
Get Jason...

525
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I don't suppose it would do me
much good to cry for help, huh?

526
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Not much.

527
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,800
You killed her.

528
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,800
It was a mistake.

529
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,700
It was supposed to be you.

530
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:34,700
There were files linking me
to the Neski murder.

531
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:38,700
If the files disappeared
and they suspected you,

532
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,800
They'd be chasing a ghost
for 10 years.

533
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,800
So we got in the way.

534
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:46,300
Is that why Neski died?
Is that why you killed Marie?

535
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:48,300
You killed marie...

536
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,300
The minute
you climbed into her car.

537
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:53,300
The minute you entered her life,
she was dead.

538
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:56,300
I told you people
to leave us alone.

539
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,800
I fell off the grid.
I was halfway around the world.

540
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:01,700
<i>There's no place
it won't catch up to you.</i>

541
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,200
It's how every story ends.

542
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,500
It's what you are, Jason...
a killer.

543
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,000
<i>You always will be.</i>

544
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:15,100
<i>Go ahead. Go on. Go on!
Do it! Do it!</i>

545
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,800
She wouldn't want me to.

546
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,900
That's the only reason
you're alive.

547
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,100
I'm a patriot.
I serve my country.

548
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:44,400
And danny zorn? What was he? Unlucky.

549
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,200
Collateral damage.

550
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:53,000
So, what do we do now?

551
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,200
I'm not sorry.

552
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,400
<i>No, no, no, forget it.
Call me as soon as he's here.</i>

553
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,400
No, that's nothing.

554
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,800
<i>- Good synch-Up.
- Who's this guy?</i>

555
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:05,100
<i>Platform "B"</i>

556
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,300
<i>Go ahead. Go on. Go on!
Do it! Do it!</i>

557
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,900
<i>She wouldn't want me to.</i>

558
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,500
That's the only reason
you're alive.

559
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,900
Got a call from langley.

560
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:29,900
<i>They're, uh, going through
Abbott's records,</i>

561
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:33,100
<i>And marshall wants to know
what's going on with bourne.</i>

562
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,400
<i>Wait, teddy. Teddy, who's
this? Look at this guy.</i>

563
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,600
<i>He's about to enter...
Right there! There!</i>

564
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:42,900
<i>Right through there.
That's bourne.</i>

565
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,100
<i>- Get down here! We got something!
- We got a sighting.! Check it out.!</i>

566
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,100
There. I got it on the big monitor.
Hold on.

567
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,800
Here it comes again.

568
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,600
<i>- Whoa, whoa. Hold on. He's just entered frame.
- It's the coat. That's him!</i>

569
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,200
What train is that?

570
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:00,900
- That's the train to Moscow.
- Why the hell would he go to Moscow?

571
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:06,400
Get me
the russian interior ministry.

572
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,500
Your telephone is dead.
What hell is happening?

573
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:59,700
You gave me one month.

574
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,100
You said to me that Jason Bourne had died.

575
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:18,900
Can you take me to this address?

576
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,300
Roubles?

577
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:53,000
Passenger picked up, taxi 34 - Leaving the station.

578
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,000
<i>Da.</i>

579
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,600
Wait here.

580
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,300
<i>- The American, yes?
- Da.</i>

581
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:37,800
Hello.

582
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,700
I'm looking for the girl who
lives with number 48.

583
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,500
The Neski girl? She does not
live here any more.

584
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,300
She left the city.

585
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,400
The Orannyi area. Number 16, I believe.

586
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:53,000
I am secret service!
I am secret service!

587
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,100
You get down!

588
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:52,200
Get away from my taxi, Asshole!

589
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:22,800
Requesting reinforcement.
High-speed pursuit.

590
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,200
Stay calm. Completely quietly. Okay?

591
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:03,800
I don't have money or drugs.
What do you want?

592
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,200
You sit.
You sit.

593
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:13,100
Sit down on the chair.

594
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:33,300
I speak english.

595
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:35,300
I'm not gonna hurt you.

596
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:39,100
I won't hurt you.

597
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,800
You're older.

598
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,800
Older than I thought you'd be.

599
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:00,800
That picture.

600
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:06,300
<i>Does that mean a lot to you?</i>

601
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:11,200
It's nothing.
It's just a picture.

602
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:13,300
No.

603
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:17,500
It's 'cause you don't know
how they died.

604
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,500
I do.

605
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,800
No, you don't.

606
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:30,300
I would want to know.

607
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:39,800
I would want to know that my...
that my mother didn't kill my father,

608
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:43,000
That she didn't kill herself.

609
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,100
What?

610
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:51,000
It's not what happened
to your parents.

611
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:59,700
I killed them.

612
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:05,200
I killed them.

613
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:09,400
It was my job.

614
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:14,200
It was my first time.

615
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:22,100
Your father
was supposed to be alone.

616
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,500
But then your mother...

617
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:32,700
<i>Came out of nowhere,</i>

618
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:39,200
<i>And I had to change my plan.</i>

619
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,600
It changes things,

620
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:49,600
That knowledge.

621
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:51,700
Doesn't it?

622
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,200
When what you love
gets taken from you,

623
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,200
You wanna know the truth.

624
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:27,700
I'm sorry.

625
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:29,200
Pamela Landy.
I hear you're still looking for me.

626
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:35,700
Bourne?
What do you want?

627
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:42,300
I wanted to thank you...

628
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,500
For the tape.

629
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:49,000
<i>We got what we needed.
It's all tied off. It's over.</i>

630
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,500
I guess I owe you an apology.

631
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:55,800
Is that official?

632
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:59,500
<i>No. Off the record.
You know how it is.</i>

633
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:01,400
Good-Bye.

634
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:04,100
Wait. Wait.

635
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:10,200
David webb.

636
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:12,200
That's your real name.

637
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:16,900
<i>You were born 4-15-71
in Nixa, Missouri.</i>

638
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:21,100
<i>Why don't you come in
and we'll talk about it.</i>

639
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:26,700
Bourne?

640
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:32,900
Get some rest, Pam.
You look tired.
