THE RETURN

4
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:23,053
Sunday

5
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:38,820
Let's jump, like we said!

6
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:41,691
Use the ladder if
you're a stupid chicken.

7
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:45,373
- Go on, Vityok. You're next.
- Why me?

8
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,212
- Scared?
- Go on, go on...

9
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:54,331
- It's scary!
- Don't chicken out!

10
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:03,930
Don't hurt your armpits!

11
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,930
- Andrei, let's use the ladder.
- You want to be called a chicken?

12
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,891
What if something happens?

13
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:19,210
Quiet! You jump after me, got it?

14
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:51,728
- Did you hurt your armpits?
- No.

15
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,368
Come on, Shorty. Jump!

16
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:03,928
Hey! What's wrong?

17
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:09,247
If you're scared, climb down.
We're not waiting!

18
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,848
Wait! He's jumping!
He just needs to focus!

19
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,687
Vanya,

20
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:18,607
jump! Come on!

21
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,085
Andrei, let's go!

22
00:03:25,846 --> 00:03:28,966
It's already late!
Jump or climb down!

23
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,446
To hell with you then!

24
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,803
Vanya, my son!

25
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,364
Mum! Mummy!

26
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:18,723
I told you not to come here!

27
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:25,684
Oh Lord!

28
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,843
- Get dressed.
- I can't.

29
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:32,242
- Let's go home!
- I can't.

30
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:35,163
- Why?
- I have to jump.

31
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:38,003
- I can't climb down.
- Why?

32
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,362
If I climb down,
they'll call me stupid and a chicken.

33
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,242
No one will know! Don't worry!

34
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,681
But you'll know

35
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:56,242
I climbed down instead of jumping.

36
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:59,601
Don't be silly, I won't tell anyone.

37
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:02,110
You can jump another time.

38
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,401
- Really?
- Of course.

39
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:06,961
Mum, I was sitting here
and I was scared.

40
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,080
If you hadn't come, I'd have died.

41
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:13,681
Don't be silly, dear!
Really, I'm here with you!

42
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,700
Monday

43
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,320
Hello everyone!

44
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:39,080
Hello!

45
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,278
We don't talk to chickens.

46
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,758
- What? Who's a chicken?
- You! A stupid chicken.

47
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,678
You're a chicken. aren't you?

48
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:53,199
Go on, Andrei, what is he?

49
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:56,038
A chicken.

50
00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:59,118
- Got it?
- You're a jerk!

51
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:20,477
- You ripped my shirt, arse!
- You busted my lip, idiot.

52
00:06:20,676 --> 00:06:22,677
Mum'll kill you!

53
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:30,395
Go on, catch me! Go on!

54
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:28,149
Mum! He ripped my shirt!

55
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:31,070
He's lying! He busted my lip!

56
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:34,390
- Hush, both of you.
- Mum...

57
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:35,710
I said quiet! Dad's sleeping!

58
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:37,790
Who?

59
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:39,109
Who's sleeping?

60
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:41,869
Your father.

61
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:49,628
Go in.

62
00:10:48,062 --> 00:10:51,022
That's definitely him.

63
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:47,498
Pour them some wine.

64
00:12:29,056 --> 00:12:30,736
Well, hello.

65
00:12:31,177 --> 00:12:32,376
Hello.

66
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,736
Hello, Dad.

67
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:36,376
Let's drink.

68
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:45,735
Like it?

69
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:48,095
Not really.

70
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:51,854
I liked it.
Can I have some more?

71
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:54,735
That's enough. Eat.

72
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,374
- Is that your car in the yard?
- Yes.

73
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,333
- Will you give us a ride?
- Of course.

74
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,934
- We're going on a trip.
- Really?

75
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:20,830
Really. Tomorrow morning.

76
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:23,734
- Really, Mum?
- Really, son.

77
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:30,372
- Are we going fishing?
- Of course, if you want.

78
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:26,770
Shorty!

79
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,929
Listen, Shorty!

80
00:14:30,729 --> 00:14:33,250
- What?
- Did you put the sinkers in?

81
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,170
Yes.

82
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,180
Good.

83
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:41,688
- You packed them yourself.
- Right.

84
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:45,889
Did you see how big he is?
Probably works out.

85
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:47,928
Probably.

86
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:53,848
- Where did he come from?
- He just came.

87
00:14:54,048 --> 00:14:58,287
- Aren't you happy?
- Yes, I'm happy.

88
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,648
But Mum said he's a pilot.
Doesn't look like one.

89
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:03,780
Why?

90
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:05,967
Well, you know how pilots are.

91
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,770
Uniforms, their caps...

92
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:18,606
He's on holiday,
why would he wear a uniform?

93
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:20,486
Maybe.

94
00:15:22,206 --> 00:15:24,087
Did you pack the camera?

95
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:27,687
Yes, and a notebook.

96
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:32,046
What for? Homework?

97
00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:35,406
To keep a diary, stupid!
We'll take turns.

98
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:37,646
Yes, we can keep a diary!

99
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:40,246
What's all this talk?
Why aren't you sleeping?

100
00:15:40,445 --> 00:15:42,286
Alright, Mum. We'll sleep.

101
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:46,605
What did you put in here, bricks?

102
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:50,326
- You'll be home in two days!
- We need all that!

103
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,045
Alright. Sleep.

104
00:15:57,445 --> 00:15:59,444
Where did he come from?

105
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:03,484
He just came.
Get to sleep, you're getting up early.

106
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,879
Tuesday

107
00:18:36,076 --> 00:18:36,796
Ivan...

108
00:18:38,396 --> 00:18:41,676
- What?
- "What, Dad?"

109
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,116
What?

110
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:46,756
You should say, "What, Dad".

111
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:50,755
What... Dad?

112
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:53,394
That's better. What's the problem?

113
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:57,835
Are you ashamed of calling
your father "Dad"?

114
00:18:58,154 --> 00:19:00,435
- No...
- Don't lie to me!

115
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:01,794
I'm not lying!

116
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:06,034
Call me Dad, like a son should!
Got it?

117
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:09,274
- Yes, Dad!
- Well done, son.

118
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:36,232
- Andrei, where are we?
- Are you awake, Shorty?

119
00:19:36,432 --> 00:19:38,072
I thought you'd sleep the whole way!

120
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:41,713
- You're the one who slept the whole way.
- What?

121
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,020
Are we there yet?

122
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:49,752
I think another thirty kilometres.

123
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:52,712
Yes.

124
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:57,352
- Who's he ringing?
- How should I know?

125
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:05,230
- I'm hungry.
- Hold on.

126
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:08,911
The town's not far, we'll eat there.

127
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,710
Dad said so.

128
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:12,630
- Dad did?
- Yes.

129
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,070
But I'm hungry now!

130
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,829
Ivan, get the flask from the rucksack.

131
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,630
Not there, in the pocket!

132
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:37,909
Thank you.

133
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,988
Drinking and driving?

134
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:45,869
- Yes, want some?
- No.

135
00:21:16,227 --> 00:21:18,707
Don't take a picture of that rubbish!

136
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:21,200
Take a picture of me.

137
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:22,267
Hang on.

138
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,424
Closed.

139
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,385
- Dad, the cafe's closed.
- I can see.

140
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:58,144
Andrei, go find out where we can eat.

141
00:21:58,345 --> 00:22:02,000
- How?
- Ask someone, stupid!

142
00:22:01,705 --> 00:22:04,784
Hurry, get moving!

143
00:23:17,181 --> 00:23:20,020
- Where's Andrei?
- I'm hungry.

144
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,900
He can find us, he's not a baby.

145
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,059
Andrei!

146
00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:49,819
Come here!

147
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,899
Closer!

148
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:57,098
- What're you doing here?
- Me?

149
00:23:58,498 --> 00:24:02,018
Yes, you.
What are you doing here?

150
00:24:02,618 --> 00:24:04,697
Dad, I found a restaurant.

151
00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:08,457
- It took you 3 hours!
- I just wanted to have a look.

152
00:24:09,418 --> 00:24:13,337
While we were waiting
you're standing here wasting time?

153
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:18,870
This won't happen again, right?

154
00:24:19,737 --> 00:24:22,416
- I just wanted...
- Answer me! Right?

155
00:24:25,057 --> 00:24:27,056
I won't do it again, Dad.

156
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:31,256
Good. Let's go eat.

157
00:24:31,456 --> 00:24:33,696
- lvan, let's go!
- I'm not coming.

158
00:24:33,897 --> 00:24:36,337
- Why?
- I am not hungry anymore.

159
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:38,417
You said you were starving.

160
00:24:39,296 --> 00:24:41,735
It went away

161
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:45,215
Ignore him, Dad.
He's as stubborn as a mule.

162
00:24:45,455 --> 00:24:49,975
- You go eat, I'll wait here.
- You're coming with us.

163
00:24:58,495 --> 00:24:59,854
Thank you.

164
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:16,293
Ivan, you have two minutes to eat.

165
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:19,613
I'm not hungry.

166
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,333
Your time's running out.

167
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,892
Eat that bread.

168
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:45,820
It's dirty.

169
00:25:46,492 --> 00:25:48,732
Who do you think is going to eat it?

170
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:52,932
Nobody. We'll just throw it away.

171
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:01,612
You've got thirty seconds left.

172
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:04,371
Eat your soup and bread.

173
00:26:07,011 --> 00:26:08,491
I'll be waiting in the car.

174
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:14,210
Sit down and eat your bread and soup.
Got it?

175
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:16,970
Yes.

176
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,210
"Yes, Dad."

177
00:26:23,491 --> 00:26:24,690
Yes.

178
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,690
Alright, sit down.

179
00:27:00,928 --> 00:27:04,780
- Is everyone happy and full?
- Yes. Thanks, Dad.

180
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:07,328
- Yes.
- Good.

181
00:27:08,087 --> 00:27:10,728
Here, call the waitress over and pay.

182
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:14,007
No, sit down and call her over!

183
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:17,327
- But how?
- With your mouth!

184
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:19,447
Lady!

185
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:21,087
Lady!

186
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:24,167
Andrei! "Excuse me."

187
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,646
- Excuse me.
- Just a moment.

188
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:32,847
Wait for me outside!

189
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:53,326
Hello? Hi, it's me.

190
00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:57,724
What was that fit about the food?
Trying to be funny?

191
00:27:57,925 --> 00:27:59,445
Get lost.

192
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:02,964
Did you see all this money?

193
00:28:03,165 --> 00:28:05,445
- So what?
- Never mind.

194
00:28:05,645 --> 00:28:06,964
Alright, boys!

195
00:28:09,844 --> 00:28:11,924
- Got any money?
- No.

196
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,164
What if I find some?

197
00:28:16,243 --> 00:28:17,484
All right, then.

198
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:23,724
Sergei, let's go!

199
00:28:25,964 --> 00:28:28,243
They stole the wallet! Get them.

200
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:30,203
Can't you do it yourself?

201
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,803
Wait for me here!

202
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:37,683
I don't know how it happened.
They just attacked us.

203
00:28:53,722 --> 00:28:57,322
If he finds them, he'll kill them!
I would.

204
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,090
Follow me!

205
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:43,358
- Is it him?
- He stole the money!

206
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,639
- He's yours.
- What do you mean?

207
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:48,690
He hit you.
Do what you want with him.

208
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:51,199
- Please, don't!
- Shut up!

209
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,398
Go to it, he hit you.

210
00:29:56,118 --> 00:29:58,478
No, I don't want to!

211
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,717
- lvan, he hit you too. Come on, son!
- Let him go!

212
00:30:06,078 --> 00:30:09,470
- What was the money for?
- I was hungry.

213
00:30:11,438 --> 00:30:13,237
Get out of here!

214
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,036
You have no guts!

215
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:21,718
- I wasn't ready.
- You should always be ready.

216
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:24,756
- What if I hadn't got the money back?
- I don't know.

217
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:29,117
- Why didn't you come out?
- I was on the phone.

218
00:30:34,116 --> 00:30:36,476
Andrei, lvan, come here!

219
00:30:37,396 --> 00:30:39,316
Get your stuff.

220
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:43,796
Don't forget the rods.

221
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,196
Andrei,
here's enough for two tickets home.

222
00:30:48,395 --> 00:30:49,660
There's your bus.

223
00:30:51,395 --> 00:30:54,475
- Why?
- I've got business to do!

224
00:30:54,715 --> 00:30:57,875
- What about the waterfalls?
- Next time!

225
00:30:58,076 --> 00:31:00,035
Next time...

226
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:02,035
In another 12 years?

227
00:31:02,674 --> 00:31:04,395
What did you say?

228
00:31:04,795 --> 00:31:09,794
It will be another twelve years before
you take us to the waterfalls again.

229
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:13,450
Did I say something wrong?

230
00:31:16,954 --> 00:31:18,714
- Dad!
- Go with your brother.

231
00:31:18,914 --> 00:31:20,114
Go, go...

232
00:31:36,713 --> 00:31:40,913
- It must be about the money.
- No, it's not.

233
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:47,020
Then because you threw a fit
in the restaurant.

234
00:31:47,832 --> 00:31:49,033
That's not why!

235
00:31:49,271 --> 00:31:52,912
- What then, brainy?
- He couldn't care less about us.

236
00:31:53,152 --> 00:31:55,952
Only an idiot like you can't see it.

237
00:31:56,151 --> 00:31:58,992
- Who's an idiot?
- You!

238
00:32:00,872 --> 00:32:02,471
You're a chicken!

239
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:10,031
You're a dick!

240
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:16,991
Get off!

241
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,030
See what an idiot you are!

242
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:32,069
What about your business?
Are we going to the falls?

243
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,990
I've got exactly three days

244
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:37,910
to get somewhere for business.

245
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:40,389
Then we'll go to the falls. Alright?

246
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:43,189
Mum's expecting us tomorrow morning.

247
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:47,269
Don't you want to spend
three more days with your dad?

248
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,829
Or wait another 12 years?

249
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,949
What do you think?

250
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,428
We wanted to fish.

251
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:57,869
And Mum knows we're with you.
So it's fine with me.

252
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:02,668
Unanimous!

253
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,418
Andrei, get in, we're off!

254
00:36:07,177 --> 00:36:09,258
I'm hungry!

255
00:36:09,938 --> 00:36:13,270
- Andrei, are you hungry?
- No.

256
00:36:12,857 --> 00:36:15,737
Me neither. Wait for supper.

257
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:31,696
I'm off to get one...

258
00:36:37,056 --> 00:36:40,176
- There're so much fish here!
- There are loads!

259
00:36:43,697 --> 00:36:46,055
- Get me one!
- Get it yourself.

260
00:36:46,296 --> 00:36:49,736
I dare you to ask me for something else.

261
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,830
Here, eat this!

262
00:37:16,974 --> 00:37:18,734
What do I do with it?

263
00:37:19,014 --> 00:37:22,693
We could make fish soup.
Do you know how?

264
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:26,174
Yes, but I don't eat fish.

265
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:31,613
- Why?
- I've had too much fish.

266
00:37:33,013 --> 00:37:34,454
Where?

267
00:37:36,293 --> 00:37:37,693
Far away.

268
00:37:38,013 --> 00:37:40,453
Don't forget to put the fire out.

269
00:37:41,653 --> 00:37:45,172
Hey, geniuses!
Who puts a tent up like this?

270
00:37:46,493 --> 00:37:48,452
Stretch it out!

271
00:38:09,972 --> 00:38:11,490
Andrei.

272
00:38:13,611 --> 00:38:16,011
- Andrei!
- What?

273
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:20,211
What did he say about fish?
Where could that happen?

274
00:38:20,771 --> 00:38:23,890
In the North, maybe.

275
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:28,410
Did you see how quiet he got
when you asked him where?

276
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,290
Why?

277
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:36,190
Who knows?
Maybe he wants to forget.

278
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:42,449
- Why?
- "Why, why"! How would I know?

279
00:38:49,169 --> 00:38:52,169
- He lies about everything!
- He's not lying.

280
00:38:52,408 --> 00:38:55,128
Who knows where he's been.

281
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:58,088
Why do you suck up to him?

282
00:38:58,288 --> 00:39:03,128
- Who sucks up?
- You do! "Dad this, Dad that."

283
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:07,488
- He's a grownup.
- So? Are we short of grownups?

284
00:39:08,728 --> 00:39:10,767
You believe every word he says.

285
00:39:11,888 --> 00:39:16,247
And who is he?
He could be a gangster!

286
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,127
He could slit our throats in the forest!

287
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:22,047
- What?
- You heard!

288
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:26,207
You're stupid, Shorty.

289
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:30,806
We'll see who's stupid
when he gets his knife out.

290
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:33,447
Go ahead and laugh.

291
00:39:36,366 --> 00:39:38,366
Ivan the fool is about to get slit!

292
00:39:38,605 --> 00:39:42,366
- What're you doing?
- Little lvan's going to get slit!

293
00:39:43,245 --> 00:39:46,166
Knock it off!

294
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,806
- Do you give up?
- Get off!

295
00:39:50,006 --> 00:39:52,885
- Give up!
- Don't you get it?

296
00:39:53,085 --> 00:39:57,750
How do I know he's our dad?
Why do you believe him?

297
00:39:58,365 --> 00:40:02,005
Idiot! Mum said he's our father.

298
00:40:03,004 --> 00:40:05,725
Our father! Got it?

299
00:40:06,365 --> 00:40:07,645
Idiot!

300
00:40:16,285 --> 00:40:17,604
Shorty?

301
00:40:18,765 --> 00:40:22,044
Vanya! Are you crying?

302
00:40:22,284 --> 00:40:23,740
Get lost!

303
00:40:23,763 --> 00:40:26,004
You got these crazy ideas in your head.

304
00:40:26,284 --> 00:40:28,604
I want to go home.

305
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:42,362
Let's go fishing tomorrow.

306
00:40:43,123 --> 00:40:46,163
Early in the morning, while he's asleep.

307
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:49,203
They bite a lot at dawn!

308
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:52,082
Okay, Vanya?

309
00:40:53,682 --> 00:40:55,082
Alright.

310
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,281
Sleep then.

311
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,082
What's that?

312
00:41:02,322 --> 00:41:05,161
The diary, it's your turn.

313
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:09,241
Tomorrow, it's late now.

314
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,920
Get the torch, we said every day!

315
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,880
Nothing ever gets past you, does it?

316
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,480
Just write!

317
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,680
Wednesday

318
00:42:24,238 --> 00:42:27,716
Shorty, get the rods ready.

319
00:42:27,957 --> 00:42:28,957
To go where?

320
00:42:29,476 --> 00:42:32,437
- Further on.
- Is that what Dad said?

321
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:34,477
Yes, Dad said. Let's go!

322
00:43:17,793 --> 00:43:22,674
Why did we have to go?
They just started biting.

323
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,233
Leave that channel.

324
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,873
I wasted all the bait.

325
00:43:46,472 --> 00:43:48,312
Turn it off.

326
00:43:51,272 --> 00:43:53,472
I saw a huge pike there!

327
00:43:53,953 --> 00:43:56,711
We could have tried the spinning rod.

328
00:43:58,431 --> 00:44:02,232
Andrei,
check how much further to Beketovo.

329
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:07,071
Who needs this Beketovo?
There's great fishing here!

330
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,431
Why are you complaining?

331
00:44:16,631 --> 00:44:20,990
We could have fished more,
we're on holiday.

332
00:44:32,351 --> 00:44:34,270
Get out!

333
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,710
Here, fish.

334
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,220
So, are they biting?

335
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:36,420
Here, get changed.

336
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,379
Tell me why you came.

337
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:48,378
What for?

338
00:47:50,298 --> 00:47:53,019
Why did you make us come?

339
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:57,379
You don't need us!

340
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:02,880
We were fine without you!
With Mum and Granny!

341
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:04,738
Why did you come?

342
00:48:04,938 --> 00:48:07,778
Why did you take us with you?

343
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:12,898
What do you need us for?
Answer me!

344
00:48:13,097 --> 00:48:17,337
- Mum asked me to spend time with you.
- Mum did?

345
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,097
- What about you?
- I want to spend time with you too.

346
00:48:21,297 --> 00:48:24,657
Why? To taunt us?

347
00:48:28,297 --> 00:48:30,097
Get changed.

348
00:48:56,456 --> 00:48:58,856
Are we stuck, Dad?

349
00:49:14,294 --> 00:49:17,253
Alright, get out of the car.

350
00:49:20,614 --> 00:49:22,654
You can at least take your shoes off!

351
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:24,174
What?

352
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:26,694
Ivan, take your shoes off!

353
00:49:36,493 --> 00:49:38,830
Here, put your coat on!

354
00:49:44,613 --> 00:49:46,092
Cut some branches.

355
00:49:57,413 --> 00:50:02,772
Andrei, let's tell him
that we're not going anywhere else!

356
00:50:03,252 --> 00:50:05,732
Let's make him take us back home!

357
00:50:05,931 --> 00:50:07,451
I don't want to.

358
00:50:07,652 --> 00:50:10,291
- How much longer?
- One second.

359
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:20,690
Put the branches under the wheels.

360
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,291
I said under, not in front!

361
00:50:28,011 --> 00:50:29,450
But how?

362
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:33,170
With your hands, with your hands!

363
00:50:34,649 --> 00:50:37,190
I'll show you once.

364
00:50:38,489 --> 00:50:39,490
- Got it?
- Yes.

365
00:50:39,689 --> 00:50:42,410
Now, do the same with the other wheel.

366
00:50:50,729 --> 00:50:52,209
What are you doing now?

367
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:56,190
What?
Why don't you just do it yourself!

368
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:06,848
Stand behind and push!

369
00:51:08,768 --> 00:51:11,608
Push. On the count of three.

370
00:51:11,808 --> 00:51:14,248
One, two, three, push. Got it?

371
00:51:14,647 --> 00:51:15,887
Got it!

372
00:51:19,848 --> 00:51:21,287
Had enough?

373
00:51:28,407 --> 00:51:30,047
Go and steer.

374
00:51:30,847 --> 00:51:33,406
Throttle on the right,
clutch on the left.

375
00:51:33,646 --> 00:51:34,607
I know.

376
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,207
Do it!

377
00:51:49,846 --> 00:51:51,685
Good work, Andrei!

378
00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:53,645
Move it.

379
00:51:55,086 --> 00:51:57,045
Ivan, get in!

380
00:52:28,363 --> 00:52:30,323
Thursday

381
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,843
Dad, what is this place?
Where are we?

382
00:52:48,043 --> 00:52:52,842
- Is there anyone here?
- No. Just us.

383
00:52:53,042 --> 00:52:56,802
- What are we doing here?
- Nothing.

384
00:52:57,001 --> 00:52:59,642
- We're going to an island.
- An island?

385
00:52:59,841 --> 00:53:02,202
Which one? That one?

386
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:04,841
No, another one.

387
00:53:07,922 --> 00:53:09,481
Get out.

388
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:45,799
Wind it up tight,
so it won't rock.

389
00:53:46,279 --> 00:53:50,079
Found it? Good, put it on the fire.

390
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:55,878
- Dad, what's next?
- We'll tar boat and set sail.

391
00:53:56,679 --> 00:53:59,399
- Will it take a long time?
- Yes.

392
00:54:23,318 --> 00:54:26,877
Andrei, spread it better
so there are no gaps.

393
00:54:28,477 --> 00:54:30,317
That seam there.

394
00:54:42,476 --> 00:54:44,716
Let the boat down to the water.

395
00:54:45,196 --> 00:54:47,316
Put the things in.

396
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:23,271
Start rowing!

397
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,000
What are you staring at? Row!

398
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,870
- Where to?
- Straight ahead.

399
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,749
Ivan, keep the bow towards the wave,
blockhead!

400
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:47,709
I can't!

401
00:56:49,869 --> 00:56:52,949
Row on my command!
Oars up!

402
00:56:53,429 --> 00:56:56,270
I said oars up!

403
00:56:56,988 --> 00:56:57,948
Row!

404
00:56:58,469 --> 00:57:01,749
Heave! Heave!

405
00:57:01,948 --> 00:57:04,388
That's it, Andrei!

406
00:57:04,628 --> 00:57:07,389
Heave, heave!

407
00:57:15,147 --> 00:57:19,188
- I can't go on!
- Yes, you can!

408
00:57:19,868 --> 00:57:22,667
You row, you're stronger!

409
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,067
Heave, heave!

410
00:58:11,624 --> 00:58:13,345
We're here.

411
00:59:53,859 --> 00:59:57,699
- Did you hang your wet clothes up?
- Of course, Dad.

412
01:00:01,498 --> 01:00:03,658
Hold your breath and drink.

413
01:00:17,817 --> 01:00:20,017
- Drink!
- I don't want to.

414
01:00:21,098 --> 01:00:22,880
Drink!

415
01:00:28,337 --> 01:00:30,057
Wash it down.

416
01:00:45,337 --> 01:00:46,860
What, Dad?

417
01:00:49,056 --> 01:00:50,936
Go to sleep.

418
01:01:16,694 --> 01:01:18,814
How are you, Shorty?

419
01:01:19,174 --> 01:01:22,254
If he touches me again, I'll kill him.

420
01:01:30,455 --> 01:01:32,214
Damn, it's soaking wet!

421
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:36,230
- Are you serious?
- What?

422
01:01:35,894 --> 01:01:39,973
- About killing him?
- If he touches me, I will.

423
01:01:42,213 --> 01:01:43,653
I see.

424
01:01:56,812 --> 01:01:59,052
Friday

425
01:02:09,812 --> 01:02:13,810
- Where did you get that?
- From the tent.

426
01:02:13,811 --> 01:02:16,731
- Is he sleeping?
- He's not there.

427
01:02:16,971 --> 01:02:18,810
Where is he?

428
01:02:21,891 --> 01:02:24,650
- Did you steal that?
- Yes.

429
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:31,930
- Put it back now!
- No, I want it with me.

430
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:33,371
Why?

431
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:39,690
- What if he notices his knife's gone?
- I don't care.

432
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,169
I didn't do it, he lost it.

433
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:47,410
- You won't tell him, will you?
- Of course not.

434
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:49,170
Then what's the problem?

435
01:02:50,889 --> 01:02:54,008
I saw a fish jumping by the shore.

436
01:02:55,729 --> 01:02:57,010
It was this big!

437
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,769
We need worms though.
That one won't go for bread.

438
01:03:01,408 --> 01:03:04,328
Don't bring the knife.
Not now, later.

439
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:06,488
No, I want to have it with me.

440
01:03:06,609 --> 01:03:07,649
Let's go, sleepy-heads!

441
01:03:08,008 --> 01:03:11,409
I'll show you the island.

442
01:03:13,329 --> 01:03:17,888
- What about breakfast?
- You can have it later. Let's go!

443
01:03:20,328 --> 01:03:22,648
- lvan, what's wrong?
- My leg hurts.

444
01:03:23,767 --> 01:03:27,287
Your leg?
It probably fell asleep, let's go.

445
01:03:27,607 --> 01:03:30,170
My leg hurts!

446
01:03:32,087 --> 01:03:35,447
If it doesn't go away you can come back.

447
01:05:27,681 --> 01:05:29,601
Follow me, kids!

448
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,760
Now you'll see.

449
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:44,639
- Well, are you coming up?
- Go on, go on...

450
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,490
Are you scared?

451
01:05:47,439 --> 01:05:49,079
My leg hurts.

452
01:06:26,998 --> 01:06:30,237
- Give me your hand. Where's lvan?
- He didn't come.

453
01:06:32,957 --> 01:06:35,357
He's scared of heights, Dad.

454
01:06:35,877 --> 01:06:36,837
Cool!

455
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:38,637
Come here!

456
01:06:42,717 --> 01:06:44,716
Look over there!

457
01:06:45,396 --> 01:06:46,317
Wow!

458
01:07:08,314 --> 01:07:11,115
Andrei, get down, quickly!

459
01:07:30,793 --> 01:07:32,873
Do you know this joke?

460
01:07:33,154 --> 01:07:38,192
A guy rings:
"Hello, is that the missile base?"

461
01:07:38,393 --> 01:07:39,954
"You got the wrong number."

462
01:07:40,153 --> 01:07:43,313
"No, you're the one
who got the wrong number, dear!"

463
01:07:44,993 --> 01:07:48,313
Another one. A guy is riding a camel...

464
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:53,420
Okay, that's enough.
Thanks for the company.

465
01:07:52,872 --> 01:07:56,792
Andrei and I will get some wood,
you wash dishes, lvan.

466
01:07:56,992 --> 01:08:01,312
- Why do I have to wash up?
- Last one cleans up.

467
01:09:13,028 --> 01:09:17,300
Not bad, for the first time.

468
01:09:17,148 --> 01:09:18,388
You know...

469
01:09:21,188 --> 01:09:23,107
your bowl sank.

470
01:09:24,027 --> 01:09:25,307
Sank?

471
01:09:28,627 --> 01:09:30,747
A wave carried it away.

472
01:09:32,707 --> 01:09:34,386
A wave?

473
01:09:35,467 --> 01:09:37,748
How am I supposed to eat now?

474
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:40,466
I didn't do it on purpose.

475
01:09:42,026 --> 01:09:45,970
Alright, I'll show you how
to make a bowl from wood.

476
01:09:45,746 --> 01:09:49,226
- I won't be able to.
- I'll teach you.

477
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:17,385
- Now what's wrong?
- Nothing.

478
01:10:18,305 --> 01:10:19,944
Look after yourselves for a bit.

479
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:24,064
- Where are you going, Dad?
- For a walk.

480
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:29,064
We need worms.
The fish here won't go for bread.

481
01:10:29,304 --> 01:10:30,424
Find some.

482
01:10:30,664 --> 01:10:33,343
Easier said than done...

483
01:10:33,984 --> 01:10:35,423
It's all sand round here!

484
01:10:35,663 --> 01:10:39,744
- Why did he take the rucksack?
- Maybe to pick mushrooms.

485
01:10:43,383 --> 01:10:47,462
Why don't we go into the forest
to get some worms?

486
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:52,623
- It's too far.
- But we need the worms.

487
01:10:52,983 --> 01:10:54,383
Then let's go.

488
01:10:54,823 --> 01:10:56,422
Bring a jar.

489
01:10:59,702 --> 01:11:02,182
- Will this do?
- It will do fine!

490
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:32,420
- Is this really an island?
- Yes, I'm telling you it is.

491
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:35,860
I was up on the tower,
there is water all around.

492
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:40,260
- No one else is here?
- Looks that way.

493
01:12:50,896 --> 01:12:53,856
- It's probably 100 years old.
- Probably.

494
01:13:07,455 --> 01:13:10,455
- Andrei, where are you?
- I'm coming.

495
01:13:15,855 --> 01:13:17,175
Come here.

496
01:13:18,214 --> 01:13:22,094
- Look.
- How did this pit get here?

497
01:13:22,295 --> 01:13:25,334
Who cares, it's full of worms!

498
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:32,294
Where's the jar?

499
01:13:54,052 --> 01:13:56,292
The fish will be begging for these worms.

500
01:13:56,492 --> 01:14:00,012
- Shall we cast from the shore?
- No, from the boat.

501
01:14:00,252 --> 01:14:03,132
Wait, we have to get Dad's permission.

502
01:14:04,092 --> 01:14:05,853
- Vanya!
- Why?

503
01:14:06,091 --> 01:14:08,492
Can't we row on our own?

504
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:10,412
Come on, push.

505
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:28,970
- Where are you going? Get back here!
- We won't go far.

506
01:14:29,851 --> 01:14:31,971
Dad, we won't be long!

507
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:44,410
Here, be back in an hour.

508
01:14:44,649 --> 01:14:47,730
- At 3:30. We have to leave.
- Got it, Dad.

509
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:50,050
Come on, sit down.

510
01:14:57,969 --> 01:15:00,790
Be back here in an hour!

511
01:15:01,969 --> 01:15:05,328
- And stay where I can see you.
- Got it, Dad.

512
01:15:07,248 --> 01:15:09,328
"Got it, Dad!"

513
01:15:10,008 --> 01:15:13,208
You're asking for it, Shorty!
I'm warning you!

514
01:15:26,408 --> 01:15:29,887
Shorty, let's go.
It's already three o'clock.

515
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:32,887
Dad said to be back in half an hour.

516
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:35,687
I'll just cast a couple more times.

517
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:41,447
There's no point.
They're not biting today.

518
01:15:41,887 --> 01:15:45,086
Andrei, let's go a little further.

519
01:15:45,646 --> 01:15:48,406
- Dad said to go back!
- Will you stop nagging?

520
01:15:48,606 --> 01:15:51,647
Just a bit further then we'll go back.

521
01:15:53,646 --> 01:15:55,805
Alright, come on then.

522
01:17:17,361 --> 01:17:19,641
Andrei! Come here!

523
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:21,681
Hurry!

524
01:17:27,641 --> 01:17:28,841
What's wrong?

525
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,000
I saw a huge fish there!

526
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:32,841
Where?

527
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:36,640
- Andrei, run and get the rod!
- Why me?

528
01:17:36,841 --> 01:17:38,160
- Hurry!
- Shit!

529
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,400
What'll we tell dad?

530
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,700
That we caught a fish
but it wasn't your idea.

531
01:18:28,757 --> 01:18:32,357
- Look what we caught!
- Andrei, what time is it?

532
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:36,037
- What?
- What time does your watch say?

533
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,357
Seven o'clock, Dad...

534
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:43,437
- When were you supposed to be back?
- At half past three...

535
01:18:43,676 --> 01:18:45,396
Did you see this fish?

536
01:18:45,636 --> 01:18:48,070
I'm not talking to you.

537
01:18:50,276 --> 01:18:52,660
Why were you late?

538
01:18:52,755 --> 01:18:53,996
Well, you see...

539
01:18:54,795 --> 01:18:55,875
What are you doing?

540
01:18:56,117 --> 01:18:58,755
- Did you hear me calling you?
- No!

541
01:19:00,156 --> 01:19:03,450
Don't even think about hitting me!

542
01:19:02,795 --> 01:19:04,235
Let me explain, the fish...

543
01:19:04,436 --> 01:19:07,675
- Why did I give you the watch?
- So, I'd have the time.

544
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:09,915
- And what happened?
- We caught a fish!

545
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:14,476
Don't touch him, it was me!
We found a ship!

546
01:19:14,715 --> 01:19:18,035
Daddy, it's true!
It was lvan.

547
01:19:18,234 --> 01:19:20,154
But you had the watch!

548
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:24,274
What do you want from me?
You're a coward, scum!

549
01:19:25,354 --> 01:19:28,040
Kill me then, just kill me!

550
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,050
You're a bastard! I hate you!

551
01:19:30,754 --> 01:19:32,634
- Kill you?
- Yes!

552
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:35,034
- Kill you?
- Yes!

553
01:19:35,634 --> 01:19:39,313
Stop! Touch him and I'll kill you!

554
01:19:40,073 --> 01:19:43,440
- You'll kill me?
- Get back!

555
01:19:45,234 --> 01:19:46,874
Get back!

556
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:49,273
Don't move!

557
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:54,153
If you weren't so evil
I could love you like a father!

558
01:19:54,393 --> 01:19:58,032
I hate you!
Don't even think about hurting us!

559
01:19:58,353 --> 01:20:00,232
You're no one!

560
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:04,031
- You're wrong, son...
- No, no, no!

561
01:20:05,353 --> 01:20:07,420
Ivan!

562
01:20:07,712 --> 01:20:09,392
Stay here!

563
01:20:20,311 --> 01:20:21,432
Ivan!

564
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:40,310
Ivan!

565
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:48,400
Dad!

566
01:21:00,269 --> 01:21:03,390
Ivan, wait for me.

567
01:21:12,149 --> 01:21:14,469
Stop, lvan!

568
01:21:39,867 --> 01:21:43,200
Go away! I hate you!

569
01:21:42,787 --> 01:21:44,827
Son, open up! Let me in!

570
01:21:45,146 --> 01:21:48,347
- What do you want, go away!
- Son, please.

571
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,026
If you don't leave, I'll jump!
Hear that, I'll jump!

572
01:21:52,227 --> 01:21:56,426
- Don't move, wait for me.
- Did you hear me, I'll jump!

573
01:22:04,266 --> 01:22:05,985
I can do it!

574
01:22:06,226 --> 01:22:08,000
I can!

575
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:10,425
You hear, I can!

576
01:22:12,825 --> 01:22:14,344
Did you hear me?

577
01:22:14,665 --> 01:22:17,745
Hear that? I can do anything!

578
01:22:18,464 --> 01:22:20,825
Asshole, I can do it!

579
01:22:24,185 --> 01:22:25,950
Vanya, son...

580
01:22:56,742 --> 01:22:58,183
Andrei...

581
01:22:58,942 --> 01:23:00,302
He's dead.

582
01:23:15,101 --> 01:23:17,942
We have to take him away.

583
01:23:18,142 --> 01:23:19,862
Where to?

584
01:23:21,662 --> 01:23:23,221
The boat.

585
01:23:24,102 --> 01:23:25,861
How?

586
01:23:26,061 --> 01:23:27,781
"With your hands"!

587
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:38,101
What are you looking at?
Take him by his legs.

588
01:23:53,259 --> 01:23:54,780
I can't.

589
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:58,290
Come here.

590
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:01,100
We'll drag him by his arms.

591
01:24:28,657 --> 01:24:32,137
- Get the axe.
- What for?

592
01:24:32,337 --> 01:24:35,337
I said get the axe, idiot!

593
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,694
I can't, Andrei.

594
01:25:33,894 --> 01:25:36,294
Hang on, we can rest a little.

595
01:25:50,093 --> 01:25:53,333
- It's the wrong way, Andrei.
- It's the right way.

596
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,693
We're lost, I'm telling you.

597
01:25:55,893 --> 01:25:57,932
Get up, let's go.

598
01:26:00,413 --> 01:26:02,220
Andrei!

599
01:26:04,012 --> 01:26:04,853
What?

600
01:26:05,052 --> 01:26:07,251
What should we do?

601
01:26:08,332 --> 01:26:10,372
His eyes are open.

602
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:26,371
Get up, let's go.

603
01:27:32,288 --> 01:27:34,770
Saturday

604
01:29:12,842 --> 01:29:14,922
Let's load everything in.

605
01:31:17,115 --> 01:31:22,115
- What was that?
- I don't know. We hit a stone.

606
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:06,386
Let's take the stuff to the car.

607
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,263
Wait.

608
01:35:01,183 --> 01:35:03,303
We'll put him inside.

609
01:35:28,181 --> 01:35:29,381
Dad!

610
01:35:30,101 --> 01:35:31,221
Dad!

611
01:35:32,421 --> 01:35:34,100
Dad!

612
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:37,600
Dad!

613
01:37:04,296 --> 01:37:05,735
Look!

614
01:37:12,455 --> 01:37:13,415
Hide it.

615
01:37:18,375 --> 01:37:22,655
- Andrei, my feet are wet.
- Take your shoes off.
