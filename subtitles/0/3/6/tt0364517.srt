2
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:41,152
Love Me If You Dare

3
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,160
I like jacks, Monopoly,

4
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,160
but only when I am the banker.
I love marbles. I always win.

5
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,152
Snakes and ladders is dumb.

6
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,153
But less than checkers,
Rubik's cube and puzzle blocks.

7
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,153
Riddles aren't my thing; the
house-jumping is quite good for two persons.

8
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,160
Hide-and-seek is
quite good too.

9
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,160
Yet there's one game you must never play.

10
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,160
And I mean never!

11
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,160
Even if your best buddy wants you to.

12
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,153
And that's burying yourself in a block of cement!

13
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,154
This game started with a pretty house.

14
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,153
A pretty bus with no driver.

15
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,160
A pretty box...

16
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,153
and a pretty girlfriend.

17
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:59,160
No, in fact, I'm wrong.
It began a little earlier

18
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,153
with a disgusting,
meaningless word, like...

19
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,160
Metastasis!

20
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,160
Sure! Why not "mammoth" while you're at it?

21
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,161
And, it made Mommy cry.

22
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:17,161
Anyway, doctors suck.

23
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:21,160
Their words suck.

24
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,160
Their trousers suck.

25
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,153
So what could they know about moms?

26
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:32,154
And then, there are other nasty words.
Like, "Kowalsky".

27
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:37,160
Don't ask.
It means nothing either.

28
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Kowalsky...

29
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,160
and also... Polack!

30
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
And... Dirty Polack!
Not forgetting.. Polack! Brassneck!

31
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,161
But all that means pretty much the same:

32
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,161
It means:
"l hurt, like nothing on Earth,

33
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:51,154
Mars, or even Altair lV!"

34
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:54,161
You like it, eh?

35
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:58,153
Me too, I find it pretty.

36
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,161
Let me see.
It's a treasure? A real one?

37
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:07,161
I've never seen such
a pretty merry-go-round, ever!

38
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:09,161
Never ever.

39
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:12,161
Maybe on Altair lV, but not on Earth.

40
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,160
I have.

41
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,154
Where? A real merry-go-round? It really exists?

42
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:21,161
Yes.. my angel, here...

43
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,152
and here.

44
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:26,152
And here too!

45
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:30,161
Julien, take the bus today,
I have to stay with your mom.

46
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:33,161
Off you go, my Ju-Ju...

47
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:35,161
Let's go.

48
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:39,154
Go, go, My Juju, go.

49
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:45,161
Your treasure!

50
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:49,155
Keep it.
My only treasure is you.

51
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,161
(screams)

52
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:58,152
(children cheer)

53
00:05:04,161 --> 00:05:06,162
Dirty Polack!

54
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:09,162
Dirty Polack!

55
00:05:09,162 --> 00:05:13,161
Sophie?
You must be mistaken, I'm Dirty Polack.

56
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:15,161
Dirty Polack!

57
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:19,161
Sophie had nothing precious that day either.

58
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:23,155
So, I had to share.

59
00:05:24,162 --> 00:05:28,162
You'll lend it sometimes?

60
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:32,161
Give and take back.
You really want it, prove it. Game or not?

61
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:34,161
That was it!

62
00:05:34,161 --> 00:05:38,155
I think that's how it all really began.

63
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:51,154
My bus! My bus!

64
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:57,153
Game!

65
00:05:58,162 --> 00:06:02,162
What did you do? What did you do?
Answer me!

66
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,162
Nothing!

67
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,162
Don't let him hit me!
He won't! Stop!

68
00:06:06,162 --> 00:06:08,161
You've no right!
You shut up!

69
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:11,162
Answer me!
Don't let him hit me!

70
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,162
He will not. He dare not..

71
00:06:13,162 --> 00:06:15,162
He won't! Game!

72
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:16,162
You don't have the right to beat him.

73
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:19,162
Stop! Be quiet!

74
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:21,162
Thinking back,
Dad never did like Sophie much,

75
00:06:21,162 --> 00:06:23,162
right from the start.

76
00:06:23,162 --> 00:06:26,163
The game just fell into place.

77
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:30,162
If Sophie had the box,
I'd do her every dare.

78
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:34,162
I do it to win the box back.

79
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:38,155
Then I'd get the box back,
and give her a dare.

80
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:42,163
Foolish game? Perhaps.

81
00:06:42,163 --> 00:06:46,155
But this is our game.

82
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:18,154
One times seven!

83
00:07:19,163 --> 00:07:21,154
Two times seven!

84
00:07:22,163 --> 00:07:24,162
Three times seven!

85
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:26,153
21.

86
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:29,162
Four times seven! 
28.

87
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:31,154
Five times seven!

88
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:35,163
35.
Six times seven!

89
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,154
42.

90
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:40,163
Seven times seven!

91
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:42,153
49.

92
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,162
Please show me some common
nouns that begin with "A".

93
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:46,153
A.

94
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:49,163
"An animal!"

95
00:07:49,163 --> 00:07:52,163
"Animals".

96
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:55,163
Anybody else? Sylvie?

97
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:59,163
Apricot!

98
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:02,162
Very good, apricots!

99
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:05,163
Now, "B"...

100
00:08:05,163 --> 00:08:07,163
Nouns beginning with "B"?

101
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:08,163
Yes, Sophie?
"B" for...

102
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:11,163
"Big-dick", "bonk"...

103
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:13,163
"B" for "beat the beaver", "bordello"...

104
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:17,163
"balls", "blow-job"...
Enough!

105
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,164
"Bug-eyed baboon", "Bitchbag"..

106
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:20,163
"Beat it bitchbag!"...

107
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:23,163
Think you're funny, miss?
What language!

108
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:25,163
I'm giving you zero,
"Z" for "zero"!

109
00:08:25,163 --> 00:08:27,163
Go to the headmaster's office.

110
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:29,163
We'll see if the headmaster thinks it's funny.

111
00:08:29,163 --> 00:08:32,163
Julien! What's going on?

112
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:35,164
To the headmaster's with Sophie!

113
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:37,164
"Boner".

114
00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:40,163
What? "B" for "boner".
Didn't have time!

115
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:42,154
Discipline.

116
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:46,163
Discipline is the basic of respect.

117
00:08:46,163 --> 00:08:50,163
Without respect, 
it's the end of civilization.

118
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,164
The decay of the fundaments of the city.

119
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,164
Loutocracy!

120
00:08:54,164 --> 00:08:58,163
And all thanks to who?

121
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:02,156
Miss Kowalsky and Mr Janvier, eh?

122
00:09:03,163 --> 00:09:07,163
Game. 
Say it again, Mr. Janvier.

123
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:10,164
If it's of interest, pray tell me.

124
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:14,164
What half-baked idea
crossed your sickly brain

125
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:17,163
to dare interrupt me?

126
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:21,156
You surely imagine,
Mr Janvier...

127
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:28,157
It was a great game,
only no one found it funny.

128
00:09:29,164 --> 00:09:31,155
Separate them!

129
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:34,164
Separate them, Miss!

130
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:35,163
Separate us?

131
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:39,156
They were never game for that!

132
00:09:56,164 --> 00:10:00,164
Mr Janvier... Come join your comrade,
Miss Kowalsky.

133
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:04,164
Great minds think alike, no?

134
00:10:04,164 --> 00:10:07,164
Know the meaning of the
word punishment?

135
00:10:07,164 --> 00:10:10,164
What future will she have if you don't

136
00:10:10,164 --> 00:10:13,164
inculcate a minimum of education?

137
00:10:13,164 --> 00:10:15,164
Hey, I'm not her mother!

138
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:18,164
Vulgarity is not on the curriculum

139
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:20,164
of the Academy,
Miss Kowalsky!

140
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:23,164
So I must, once again,
summon your parents.

141
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:27,164
Our parents don't speak French.
For them, "dick" means..

142
00:10:27,164 --> 00:10:31,158
"hammer". 
Anything else?

143
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:36,164
And you won't know what's hit you!

144
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:38,164
You're deprived of dessert,
outings, TV...

145
00:10:38,164 --> 00:10:41,164
No more sweets,

146
00:10:41,164 --> 00:10:43,164
no more comics,
and no more light in the corridor!

147
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:47,158
Now, go get your coat.

148
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:52,164
That's enough!

149
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:56,157
Cool, you too!

150
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:08,165
Straight to your room!
Julien, don't wake your mom!

151
00:11:08,165 --> 00:11:10,155
Julien!

152
00:11:11,164 --> 00:11:15,157
Julien...Mother!

153
00:11:16,164 --> 00:11:20,165
We ate this neat thing in the canteen!
You stayed in bed all day?

154
00:11:20,165 --> 00:11:22,156
Lucky you!

155
00:11:28,164 --> 00:11:32,157
I had dictation!
Listen, Julien... A doctor came to see me today.

156
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:36,165
I made five mistakes. 
And guess what?

157
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:39,165
Juju...
I got 10 in recitation. 

158
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,156
Wanna hear it?

159
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:47,157
And I did something really silly.

160
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:54,165
Friends are like spectacles.

161
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:58,165
They make you look clever,
but it gets scratched,

162
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:02,158
and you tire.
Luckily, sometimes, you hit on far-out specs.

163
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:07,158
Me... I've got Sophie.

164
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:28,165
Now..

165
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,165
words beginning with "A".
Aardvark... Good.

166
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:33,165
Austria... Very good.
Ass... 

167
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:36,165
Altair lV. Continue.
Game or not?

168
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:38,166
Game!
I'm giving you a zero, you hear?

169
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:41,166
Zero. Go to the headmaster's office.

170
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,166
Discipline.

171
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,165
Forever discipline.

172
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,165
Don't say I didn't tell you!

173
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:50,156
This time you're being warned!

174
00:12:51,165 --> 00:12:54,165
You can kiss Eden goodbye!

175
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:58,166
Now sparks will really fly!

176
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:02,166
You, my dear, 
in pain hall you bring forth children,

177
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:06,165
wear high heels,
undergo diets,

178
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:09,165
exfoliation,
face-lifts,

179
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:11,166
and what's more,

180
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,166
you'll have to cook!

181
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,166
And that's not all!

182
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:21,166
For you, my boy,
I've reserved the worst,

183
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,165
scourges and torments,

184
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:27,159
dinosaurs and volcanoes!
Godzilla, the A-bomb, Liz Taylor, Hitler, dead lndians,

185
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:32,166
noisy washing machines,
oil-slicks,

186
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:36,166
but above all...
moms, pretty and ill.

187
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,166
...And that way,
lives a March Hare.

188
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:43,159
Visit either you like,
they're both mad.

189
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,166
But I don't want to go
among the mad, Alice remarked.

190
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,166
Oh you can't help that, said the cat, we're all mad here.
I'm mad, you're mad.

191
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:54,159
Mother, will you die?

192
00:13:56,166 --> 00:14:00,166
I don't read well?
Are you going to die?

193
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,166
Yes. Like everybody.

194
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:06,166
Is it because of me?
Because I do silly things?

195
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,157
Here!

196
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,166
Ask me to do something intelligent,

197
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,166
I swear I will.

198
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,167
I'm game.

199
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:20,159
Be quiet. Not for that.
Block your ears. Hard, harder.

200
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,166
Can you hear how I love you?

201
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,166
Nothing else matters.

202
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,167
Where were we?

203
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:36,160
Sophie can write with
her teeth, that matters!

204
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,166
It seems neither Alice, nor your mother

205
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:43,159
interest you as much as Sophie.

206
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,166
So... With her teeth. Easy!

207
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:50,167
And how about with her ears?

208
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:54,160
Can you? And flick spiders into the mashed-potato?
And rope-climb, blind-folded?

209
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,166
A glass on your head?

210
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,157
I don't believe you!

211
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:11,160
Think you're
the first to play dares?

212
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,158
Ok. Good night.

213
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:25,167
Mom!

214
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:29,167
What's the craziest thing you ever did?
Flew.

215
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,167
Flew? Flew where?

216
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,167
Across the sky.

217
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:36,166
Show me, come on!
Fly, fly!

218
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:40,160
Game!

219
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:50,167
Later. When?

220
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:51,167
Soon.

221
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,158
I promise.

222
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:04,167
The idea of reading him a story!

223
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:08,167
In your condition!
It's you who should be in bed.

224
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,168
Mom!

225
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,167
Will I be punished seriously or lightly?

226
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:14,167
It's just that...

227
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:18,160
Sophie invited me to her sister's wedding.
No!

228
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,158
Shh...

229
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:37,167
Her dress is awful!

230
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:38,167
So is her guy!

231
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:41,168
Anyway, if we wed one day...
You'll say no on the altar, game?

232
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,159
Game! Of course.

233
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:46,168
What'll you be when you grow up?

234
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:47,168
A tyrant!

235
00:16:47,168 --> 00:16:50,167
A tyrant!
Your people subjugated?

236
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:54,167
Totally!
With a harem and slaves.

237
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:58,168
I'll torture them every
Thursday, what about you?

238
00:16:58,168 --> 00:17:02,168
Well, l...No, it's too silly.

239
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:03,168
Tell me!
You won't like it.

240
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:05,159
I told you. Tell me!

241
00:17:06,168 --> 00:17:10,160
I'd like to be a flan.
A flan with apricots, or even plain.

242
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:15,168
Lukewarm, at the baker's.
In the window.

243
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,168
A flan? As in cake?

244
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:21,161
Of course! What else?
A flan is a flan!

245
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:26,161
A flan... a flan...

246
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:32,168
Yeah, of course, a flan!

247
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:36,161
That's brilliant!
Game or not?

248
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:41,161
Yes, game...

249
00:17:46,168 --> 00:17:48,168
Not bad.
Not bad?

250
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:51,168
That's why men earn more than women?

251
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:55,168
Good workers have good tools.

252
00:17:55,168 --> 00:17:57,168
My turn.
Show me your fanny.

253
00:17:57,168 --> 00:18:00,168
No, that was my dare,
You have no right to copy.

254
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:02,160
Game or not?

255
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:11,168
Game!

256
00:18:11,168 --> 00:18:14,168
That's it?
Can't see a thing!

257
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:18,161
See, women are smarter than men.

258
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:30,168
It's easier to just be friends.

259
00:18:30,168 --> 00:18:34,161
Pull the cloth.
Game!

260
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:39,162
Now you. Harder!
Game!

261
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:59,169
Julien, I looked all over for you.

262
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:03,161
The violin teacher is ill...
We will discuss it later. Please come.

263
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:12,160
Mom!

264
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:23,169
My Julien...
My brave boy.

265
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:27,169
You'll get better!

266
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:31,169
You'll get better?
Game or not?

267
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:35,162
You don't have the box, darling.
It's not your turn to dare.

268
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:39,168
I'll go get it!

269
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:43,162
Stay, Julien.
Kiss your mother.

270
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:55,162
I'll go later, then you'll
show me how you fly.

271
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:42,169
What're you doing here?

272
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:43,169
Julien...

273
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:46,170
Please leave. Father doesn't like it.

274
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,163
Sure, I am only a partner to play with.

275
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:55,162
Hop for the next hour!
Game or not?

276
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:13,162
I do two and Mom gets better.

277
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,163
I do three, and she
comes home for my birthday.

278
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,160
Good!

279
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,163
I do four, and she will come
back home tonight healthily.

280
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,161
Mom!

281
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,170
Mom!

282
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,162
Mom!

283
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,161
Mom!

284
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,170
Mom!

285
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,170
Mom!

286
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,161
Mom!

287
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,161
Mom!

288
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:41,164
Hello,

289
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:27,164
I'm Julien's dad.
Are you Sophie's mom?

290
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:31,162
I'm her sister.

291
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:34,162
I'd like to... Could...

292
00:23:37,171 --> 00:23:39,171
It is or not?

293
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:43,165
Can Sophie sleep over... tonight?

294
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:48,164
You asleep?
Officially, yes.

295
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:53,171
It's rumored that you are pretending.

296
00:23:53,171 --> 00:23:56,171
Yes, so I read in Paris Match.
Pure gossip.

297
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:58,171
Now, goodnight.

298
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:02,172
Tomorrow, can I sleep over at your place?
Can l?

299
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:06,171
No, never!
You must never come to my place, promise!

300
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:08,171
Why not? It'd be...

301
00:24:08,171 --> 00:24:09,171
Promise!

302
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:11,171
Okay, then.

303
00:24:11,171 --> 00:24:13,162
Good night.

304
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:32,172
That's how you get bad habits.

305
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:36,172
I don't mean breaking cups.
That's kinda fun!

306
00:24:36,172 --> 00:24:38,163
I meant sleeping.

307
00:24:39,172 --> 00:24:43,164
Sophie and me, from that night on,
have slept together for ten years.

308
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:51,165
On the morning, 
something serious happened.

309
00:24:57,172 --> 00:25:01,164
Right! On the morning,
something serious happened.

310
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:08,165
Shit and damn!

311
00:25:09,172 --> 00:25:10,172
What's the time?

312
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:12,172
My exam!

313
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:13,172
What exam?

314
00:25:13,172 --> 00:25:14,172
Math.

315
00:25:14,172 --> 00:25:16,163
You need not to take the examination. You'll fail.

316
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:22,172
I told you, I hate that!

317
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:26,165
Hey, watch it!

318
00:25:28,172 --> 00:25:30,163
You're sick!

319
00:25:33,172 --> 00:25:35,163
The feathers...

320
00:25:36,173 --> 00:25:38,172
Julien!

321
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:41,172
What's all that noise?

322
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,172
Julien!

323
00:25:43,172 --> 00:25:45,172
Open up!

324
00:25:45,172 --> 00:25:47,172
Shit and double damn...

325
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:51,165
Julien! 
Open, or I'll come in!

326
00:25:52,173 --> 00:25:54,164
Julien!

327
00:26:11,173 --> 00:26:13,173
Give me that.

328
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:15,172
Game or not?

329
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:18,172
No, not this morning.
I've butterflies in the tummy as it is.

330
00:26:18,172 --> 00:26:20,163
What if this morning,

331
00:26:22,172 --> 00:26:26,166
Sophie were to wear the bra?

332
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:30,173
Game starts again.

333
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:32,173
Miss Kowalsky.

334
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:36,165
Kowalsky,
Sophie Kowalsky.

335
00:26:40,172 --> 00:26:42,173
The rules of the game hadn't changed.

336
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:46,166
What was called teasing as kids
might now be called perversion.

337
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:50,173
Pervasion?
It's a matter of taste, like Chinese food.

338
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:54,165
You like it, or don't.
Only if you're Chinese, you've no choice.

339
00:26:56,172 --> 00:26:58,173
I'm Julien.
And I'm "Take a Hike"!

340
00:26:58,173 --> 00:27:02,173
Life for me was like

341
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:06,166
playing Beethoven's 5th
with fingernails on a blackboard.

342
00:27:07,173 --> 00:27:10,173
Miss Kowalsky.

343
00:27:10,173 --> 00:27:13,173
Vectorial functions?

344
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:17,173
So, V1 by V2 is equal to
the product of their modules

345
00:27:17,173 --> 00:27:21,166
multiplied by the cosine of
the angle of their two bodies.

346
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:26,166
You seem good at
vectorial functions.

347
00:27:27,173 --> 00:27:30,174
Tell me if I'm wrong

348
00:27:30,174 --> 00:27:34,173
Miss Kowalsky.

349
00:27:30,174 --> 00:27:34,173
Tell me whether I was wrong.

350
00:27:34,173 --> 00:27:37,173
Your vector is defined by an origin,

351
00:27:37,173 --> 00:27:39,173
but above all by size in vectorial space.

352
00:27:39,173 --> 00:27:43,166
Some vectorial spaces are hotter than others.

353
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:48,174
Care to develop
your theory with me?

354
00:27:48,174 --> 00:27:50,173
It could be exponential.

355
00:27:50,173 --> 00:27:54,173
You usually revise alone?

356
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,164
This makes me deaf.

357
00:28:00,173 --> 00:28:02,174
The answer to intrinsic function

358
00:28:02,174 --> 00:28:04,174
The solution of sub-function delta

359
00:28:04,174 --> 00:28:06,174
Kowalsky

360
00:28:06,174 --> 00:28:10,173
Minus 3m squared,

361
00:28:10,173 --> 00:28:12,164
Minus 2m, plus 1.

362
00:28:13,173 --> 00:28:16,173
Minus 2m, plus 1.

363
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:18,174
Miss Kavasky...

364
00:28:18,174 --> 00:28:20,174
I didn't authorize you to leave!

365
00:28:20,174 --> 00:28:23,174
Fx has two distinct roots

366
00:28:23,174 --> 00:28:27,173
If m is between -1 and 1/3

367
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:30,173
Gotta go, that's my sister.

368
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:34,167
You jerk.
Louder, I'm deaf.

369
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:38,174
It worked, didn't it? I did it!
Don't keep such a straight face.

370
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:42,174
What else can you do except seduce women?

371
00:28:42,174 --> 00:28:44,174
Don't you see?
The examiner had the wrong name.

372
00:28:44,174 --> 00:28:47,173
She thought you are Kawasaky

373
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:50,174
I fiddled the roll.

374
00:28:50,174 --> 00:28:53,174
No result, you get no mark!
For her you're Kawasaky.

375
00:28:53,174 --> 00:28:56,174
But it was fun, no?
A 20-minute firing squad, all eyes on my bra!

376
00:28:56,174 --> 00:29:00,167
But what do you care! Your sugar-lumps.
Don't even know the chick!

377
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:04,174
I was just passing time.
And she knows nothing about math.

378
00:29:04,174 --> 00:29:05,173
Aurelie Miller, a total bimbo!

379
00:29:05,173 --> 00:29:09,167
Her twin claim to fame:
she laid lgor, the gym coach

380
00:29:10,174 --> 00:29:13,174
and she's got really wild earrings.

381
00:29:13,174 --> 00:29:15,174
Now you know all.
Jealous?

382
00:29:15,174 --> 00:29:16,174
Me?
Yeah, you!

383
00:29:16,174 --> 00:29:20,174
Lay all the sluts you like!
I just wanna pass, despite this!

384
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:24,174
Hey! You are jealous. Forgive me!
Just drop it!

385
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:28,174
As for Aurelie Miller, you have my blessing.
Hear she fucks great. Not much she hasn't.

386
00:29:28,174 --> 00:29:31,174
You two seems like a pair to death.

387
00:29:31,174 --> 00:29:34,174
Stop, Sophie.
I mean, why deprive yourself?

388
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:38,174
Just bring me back her earrings.
Game?

389
00:29:38,174 --> 00:29:42,168
Miss Miller! Aurelie Miller?

390
00:29:49,174 --> 00:29:51,174
Got a boyfriend?  Yes.

391
00:29:51,174 --> 00:29:54,174
Now, you have two.

392
00:29:54,174 --> 00:29:57,175
And you? Is that really your sister?

393
00:29:57,175 --> 00:30:01,175
It's she who asked me to come.
Well, beat it!

394
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:05,174
Or I'll scream the place down.

395
00:30:05,174 --> 00:30:09,167
Hey!

396
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:13,166
Yes, what is it?

397
00:30:14,175 --> 00:30:17,175
Cute place you got.

398
00:30:17,175 --> 00:30:20,175
I've shitty taste,
that's why I like you.

399
00:30:20,175 --> 00:30:22,174
Miller Aurelie

400
00:30:22,174 --> 00:30:24,174
Still no sign?

401
00:30:24,174 --> 00:30:28,175
When will we meet again?
The third semester, maybe.

402
00:30:28,175 --> 00:30:31,175
Aurelie, I beg you.
Give me your earrings.

403
00:30:31,175 --> 00:30:34,175
They reflect your golden hair,
yet pale before your breasts.

404
00:30:34,175 --> 00:30:38,168
Abandon your numbed
slave to their contemplation.

405
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:44,168
You're weird!

406
00:30:46,175 --> 00:30:50,175
Really crazy.
Now be nice, let me go.

407
00:30:50,175 --> 00:30:54,168
We've revised our functions, Iet's not get linear.
That's not like us.

408
00:30:56,175 --> 00:30:59,174
Believe in love at first sight?
Yeah...

409
00:30:59,174 --> 00:31:01,166
Naive!

410
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:09,168
Aurelie Miller, you failed the exam.

411
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:27,175
That's docked from my pay!

412
00:31:27,175 --> 00:31:31,168
How was it?
I don't like blondes.

413
00:31:32,176 --> 00:31:35,176
You did it! You bastard!

414
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:37,175
Tyrant.

415
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:41,175
That's enough! 
Now she has nothing.

416
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:45,168
Except lgor, the gym coach,
with biceps bigger than his brain.

417
00:31:46,175 --> 00:31:50,176
I already fucked him.

418
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:54,176
So how big is his biceps?
As big as your lQ.

419
00:31:54,176 --> 00:31:58,168
You're into that?
As second choice, yeah!

420
00:31:59,175 --> 00:32:03,168
What do you mean, second choice?
Who's first choice?

421
00:32:05,176 --> 00:32:09,169
Your turn.
Your turn, quick!

422
00:32:10,176 --> 00:32:11,176
Beat it, twerp!
Easy, lgor.

423
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:15,175
Heard of crazy wagers?
Blaise Pascal?

424
00:32:15,175 --> 00:32:17,175
Seems not.

425
00:32:17,175 --> 00:32:21,169
You're nuts!

426
00:32:43,176 --> 00:32:45,167
Let's talk something else.

427
00:32:46,176 --> 00:32:50,169
Kick his ass.

428
00:33:02,176 --> 00:33:04,167
Say you regret it!

429
00:33:05,176 --> 00:33:06,176
Come on, it was fun!

430
00:33:06,176 --> 00:33:08,176
Say it!

431
00:33:08,176 --> 00:33:09,176
It's not part of the game.
You should not have went.

432
00:33:09,176 --> 00:33:13,176
Look, I'm in this state because I'm game for anything!
Now apologize!

433
00:33:13,176 --> 00:33:17,176
You will get nothing from me.

434
00:33:17,176 --> 00:33:21,169
Jerk, give me the box.

435
00:33:25,176 --> 00:33:29,176
Kiss me.
Game?

436
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:31,167
Game!

437
00:33:38,176 --> 00:33:42,170
I said, kiss me.

438
00:33:45,177 --> 00:33:48,176
Are you off your rockers?

439
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:52,176
Get off my car, and I'll tell you.

440
00:33:52,176 --> 00:33:56,176
Do you hear me? Get off and I tell you.

441
00:33:56,176 --> 00:33:59,177
They're totally mad!

442
00:33:59,177 --> 00:34:01,177
Get down! You hear?

443
00:34:01,177 --> 00:34:05,170
Bloody idiots!

444
00:34:17,177 --> 00:34:19,168
Hold me.

445
00:34:27,176 --> 00:34:29,167
Love me.

446
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:32,168
Game!

447
00:34:34,177 --> 00:34:38,170
For you this is a game?

448
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:43,177
No, a wager.
You threw it out.

449
00:34:43,177 --> 00:34:46,176
Well if I did,
you didn't catch it.

450
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:50,170
Poor jerk,
you'll miss your bus.

451
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:56,177
It was time to grow up.

452
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,177
As a kid you think it happens gently.

453
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:03,178
But it whips you,
Iike a branch on the rebound,

454
00:35:03,178 --> 00:35:07,170
or when your father says:

455
00:35:08,177 --> 00:35:10,177
It's over, Julien!

456
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:14,177
Playtime's over.
You've an exam in two months. Remember? An exam!

457
00:35:14,177 --> 00:35:16,177
So don't mess up,
or you'll mess with me.

458
00:35:16,177 --> 00:35:19,178
Hey, Dad!
It's no big deal. Be Zen!

459
00:35:19,178 --> 00:35:21,169
Zen!

460
00:35:23,177 --> 00:35:27,177
You little lout!
You think I'm not Zen enough?

461
00:35:27,177 --> 00:35:28,177
I'll tell you that

462
00:35:28,177 --> 00:35:31,177
Your games killed the woman I loved

463
00:35:31,177 --> 00:35:33,177
who you may recall was your mother!

464
00:35:33,177 --> 00:35:36,178
You are so contemptible!
I didn't kill Mom.

465
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:40,178
I'm a contemptible person, 
not a gentleman.

466
00:35:40,178 --> 00:35:41,177
I'm so contemptible that
I brought you up alone! Shit!

467
00:35:41,177 --> 00:35:44,177
You bastard, l didn't kill her! 
Yes, I'm a bastard.

468
00:35:44,177 --> 00:35:47,177
I can tear your face.

469
00:35:47,177 --> 00:35:51,170
I can't believe that
Sophie poisoned you

470
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:55,178
To the point
that we never talk

471
00:35:55,178 --> 00:35:59,171
Unless your girlfriend
has a wager on me.

472
00:36:02,177 --> 00:36:03,177
You choose.

473
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:06,177
It's her or me, so...

474
00:36:06,177 --> 00:36:08,178
Game...

475
00:36:08,178 --> 00:36:10,169
Or not?

476
00:36:38,177 --> 00:36:40,178
Sophie!

477
00:36:40,178 --> 00:36:44,171
Hi, Julien. Looking for Sophie?
She's not in.

478
00:36:48,178 --> 00:36:52,178
What are you doing here?
I told you never to come here.

479
00:36:52,178 --> 00:36:56,179
You satisfied? Now that you've seen it?

480
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:57,178
You promised, we wagered.

481
00:36:57,178 --> 00:37:00,178
Who cares? Listen...
I care!

482
00:37:00,178 --> 00:37:04,178
I'm packing it in.
Sorry, I didn't know.

483
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:07,178
"Sorry",
that changes everything.

484
00:37:07,178 --> 00:37:11,178
Come on, let's go. 
Go where?

485
00:37:11,178 --> 00:37:13,179
Stuff your pity.

486
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:15,170
You go by yourself.

487
00:37:17,178 --> 00:37:19,178
Sophie, forgive me!

488
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:21,178
Beat it!

489
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:23,178
Game or not?

490
00:37:23,178 --> 00:37:25,169
Beat it!

491
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:11,172
To forgive me, 
One of the toughest dares I'd ever given Sophie.

492
00:38:12,178 --> 00:38:16,178
But she never liked things easy.

493
00:38:16,178 --> 00:38:19,179
This took her a long
time, maybe it's too long.

494
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:23,172
Meanwhile my dad's
bluntness had gotten to me.

495
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:25,179
Hello...

496
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:29,172
Is Julien in?

497
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:37,179
Please, Mr Janvier...

498
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:41,179
I've come to see Julien.

499
00:38:41,179 --> 00:38:43,179
Is he there?

500
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:47,172
Julien? Can you hear me?

501
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:18,172
Not a word,
it's for me to speak.

502
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:20,179
You missed me?

503
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:23,180
Because I miss you, you tyrant.

504
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,180
You're a real tyrant.
It's so hard to be mad at you.

505
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,179
But don't kid yourself,
I still am.

506
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:34,179
I wanted to talk, forgetting the game,
just for once.

507
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:38,180
Like my dress?
I hesitated.

508
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,180
Nabbed it off my sister.
She has another red one,

509
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,180
like a thermonuclear warhead...

510
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,179
That's the one I should've worn.

511
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:52,179
I must've spent, I dunno,
3 hours before the mirror.

512
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:56,180
But I got there, see?
I'm pretty.

513
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:00,180
So, like it or I'll kill you!

514
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,171
No, wait...

515
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:08,179
Where was l?

516
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:10,179
The problem is, that...

517
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:14,180
even if you said
"l love it" I'd not believe you.

518
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,180
Julien, I no longer know
when you're playing...

519
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,180
And when you are not.

520
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,180
I'm lost.

521
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,172
Wait, I'm not finished.

522
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:28,180
Tell me you love me.

523
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,180
Tell me, because if I tell you first

524
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,173
I'm afraid you'll think it's a game.

525
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:41,173
Help me, please.

526
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,171
Thank you.

527
00:41:01,181 --> 00:41:03,171
Hi.

528
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,180
Hi.

529
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,180
Julien

530
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,180
Come to revise?

531
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,180
You got it!
It seems you are not.

532
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,180
Not now, please

533
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,181
When, then? Tomorrow?

534
00:41:18,181 --> 00:41:21,180
One year later. I'm sorry.

535
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:25,180
Spare me your "sorrys"!

536
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,180
Urbanism! Do you really like this?

537
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:32,174
Just remember, Iow-cost housing,
that's my expertise.

538
00:41:35,181 --> 00:41:37,181
We never did
speak about the future.

539
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:39,181
Us two.

540
00:41:39,181 --> 00:41:42,180
I mean, both our futures.

541
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,180
"Both our futures"?

542
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,180
Funny,
I'd have said "our future".

543
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:51,181
But then I only live for now.
I guess...

544
00:41:51,181 --> 00:41:55,174
I saw us going on
like this years.

545
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,180
You are an idiot.

546
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,173
OK, pass the exam.
Game or not?

547
00:42:04,181 --> 00:42:06,181
I'm sorry.

548
00:42:06,181 --> 00:42:09,181
"I'm sorry, Sophie".
Sure.

549
00:42:09,181 --> 00:42:12,181
In fact,
we did talk about the future

550
00:42:12,181 --> 00:42:15,181
once...
and weren't too far wrong:

551
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:19,173
You're becoming a tyrant,
and me a flan.

552
00:42:27,181 --> 00:42:31,181
Stay. No, I don't want to delay you.
Stop your nonsense.

553
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:35,174
Go study, it's no problem. I've exams to pass too.
I'm studying men.

554
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:40,181
So you're taking sociology!
Not humans...


555
00:42:40,181 --> 00:42:42,181
but men.

556
00:42:42,181 --> 00:42:45,181
Males, guys.
I've a lot of catching up to do.

557
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:48,181
Well, this is a library

558
00:42:48,181 --> 00:42:52,181
There is no better place to learn, is there?

559
00:42:52,181 --> 00:42:54,173
Game?
Game!

560
00:42:58,181 --> 00:43:01,181
Stop, you are doing something stupid.

561
00:43:01,181 --> 00:43:03,181
Quit it!
Why? It was just a dare.

562
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:07,181
It's just a bet. Come
on, let me work over it.

563
00:43:07,181 --> 00:43:11,175
I'll go study.
See you in a year.

564
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:22,172
What happened?

565
00:43:23,181 --> 00:43:25,173
Hmm

566
00:43:27,182 --> 00:43:29,182
You know what I am saying clearly.

567
00:43:29,182 --> 00:43:33,174
No, I don't. Say it!

568
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:39,181
It is not easy to say that.

569
00:43:39,181 --> 00:43:43,175
Can't it wait a year?

570
00:43:46,182 --> 00:43:48,182
Here! Study with care.

571
00:43:48,182 --> 00:43:49,182
Be careful.

572
00:43:49,182 --> 00:43:53,174
You want to hurt me?
Don't be a fool, you never could.

573
00:44:06,182 --> 00:44:08,182
You'll wait for me?

574
00:44:08,182 --> 00:44:11,181
Is that a dare?

575
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:13,181
No.

576
00:44:13,181 --> 00:44:17,175
Then, you'll see.

577
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:48,176
Sophie! Sophie, I love you!

578
00:44:51,182 --> 00:44:55,175
I love you, I love you, come down.

579
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:27,182
What an idiot!

580
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,182
Look at the fool sitting on the chair.

581
00:45:29,182 --> 00:45:31,182
wheezing as
an excuse or grimacing!

582
00:45:31,182 --> 00:45:33,182
Excuses!

583
00:45:33,182 --> 00:45:37,176
Wouldn't it be easier
to go take her in your arms,

584
00:45:38,183 --> 00:45:42,183
whispering words of love every day?

585
00:45:42,183 --> 00:45:46,175
While at the very sight
of her, your heart misses a beat.

586
00:45:50,182 --> 00:45:52,183
Hey, I'm talking to you!
You hear me?

587
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:56,176
Of course you do.
That's just it.

588
00:45:57,183 --> 00:46:01,176
What a total idiot!
And his troubles have only begun.

589
00:46:16,183 --> 00:46:20,183
Yes?

590
00:46:20,183 --> 00:46:22,183
Got an evening dress?

591
00:46:22,183 --> 00:46:25,183
Not even an evening.
They're on me.

592
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:28,183
I've something
important to ask you.

593
00:46:28,183 --> 00:46:30,183
What do you like to drink?

594
00:46:30,183 --> 00:46:31,183
A coffee and...

595
00:46:31,183 --> 00:46:35,183
And that's it.

596
00:46:35,183 --> 00:46:37,183
Can we talk? 
No.

597
00:46:37,183 --> 00:46:41,177
Sorry, but we never
hit it off in certain things.

598
00:46:42,183 --> 00:46:45,183
Stupid things... For
example, your shoes.

599
00:46:45,183 --> 00:46:48,183
My shoes? Yes, it is funny.

600
00:46:48,183 --> 00:46:52,183
Yeah... You look a right prat
in your Doc's and pressed pants.

601
00:46:52,183 --> 00:46:56,184
It's such an eyeful,
I can't even listen.

602
00:46:56,184 --> 00:46:58,175
Here, it's on the house.

603
00:46:59,184 --> 00:47:01,183
I can't just take them off.

604
00:47:01,183 --> 00:47:04,183
Up to you.
You wanted to talk.

605
00:47:04,183 --> 00:47:07,183
On Mondays I finish at 7.
Come by later.

606
00:47:07,183 --> 00:47:10,183
Okay. No.
In fact,

607
00:47:10,183 --> 00:47:12,184
I've got my singing lesson.

608
00:47:12,184 --> 00:47:13,184
You sing?

609
00:47:13,184 --> 00:47:17,184
Yes, this is not my
life, it is only a job.

610
00:47:17,184 --> 00:47:21,183
I guess it doesn't
fit our saving hero image,

611
00:47:21,183 --> 00:47:24,183
but these past years,
I have lived!

612
00:47:24,183 --> 00:47:27,183
I'd no idea.

613
00:47:27,183 --> 00:47:30,184
Glad to hear that
you're taking lessons.

614
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:34,177
Want to be a singer?
That's you all over, profitability!

615
00:47:36,184 --> 00:47:38,183
Lessons equals singing career!

616
00:47:38,183 --> 00:47:40,183
Like giving 100 pounds to the
starving means you're Mother Theresa!

617
00:47:40,183 --> 00:47:44,184
Damn it, I said I wouldn't talk to you.

618
00:47:44,184 --> 00:47:48,177
Your shoes, your pants, they put me off.
Now let me work.

619
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,183
Hi.
Hello.

620
00:47:58,183 --> 00:48:00,184
Okay?
Fine, and you?

621
00:48:00,184 --> 00:48:02,175
Very well.

622
00:48:04,184 --> 00:48:08,177
So, can I ask you to dinner now?

623
00:48:09,184 --> 00:48:11,175
No.

624
00:48:12,184 --> 00:48:14,184
Where are you going?
Ask less, get more answers.

625
00:48:14,184 --> 00:48:17,184
You said you finish
at 7 on Mondays!

626
00:48:17,184 --> 00:48:20,184
Today is Tuesday.

627
00:48:20,184 --> 00:48:22,175
Today is Tuesday.

628
00:48:27,184 --> 00:48:29,175
Wait for me.

629
00:48:30,184 --> 00:48:34,178
I want to invite you for dinner.

630
00:48:36,184 --> 00:48:40,177
Go away! You too?

631
00:49:00,184 --> 00:49:03,184
Never seen such a jam!
A truck doing a U-turn...

632
00:49:03,184 --> 00:49:07,185
Got someone?
What?

633
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:09,176
Have you got a lover?

634
00:49:10,185 --> 00:49:14,184
Why did you ask me so? 
No reason.

635
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:17,184
Just head-on dialectic
on the state of the heart.

636
00:49:17,184 --> 00:49:21,178
Head-on dialectic!
Don't we say "conversation"?

637
00:49:26,185 --> 00:49:30,178
So, you're in love?

638
00:49:31,185 --> 00:49:35,184
You don't have to answer,
it is only a question.

639
00:49:35,184 --> 00:49:38,185
I don't have someone else in my bed,
if you're wondering.

640
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:42,185
No one I can't change with the sheets.
He's a footballer, Sergei Nimov-Nemovich.

641
00:49:42,185 --> 00:49:46,178
Or was,
ditched him this morning.

642
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:50,184
How could you
date a name like that?

643
00:49:50,184 --> 00:49:54,185
I was sick of naming dates.

644
00:49:54,185 --> 00:49:57,185
And since this morning?

645
00:49:57,185 --> 00:50:01,185
Apart from Sergei?
Greg, his buddy, Jerome, his father,

646
00:50:01,185 --> 00:50:04,185
A French, two and three Kevin's

647
00:50:04,185 --> 00:50:06,185
Cinderella's prince,
the robots from Star Wars,

648
00:50:06,185 --> 00:50:10,178
nothing too serious,
a heart up for grabs!

649
00:50:11,185 --> 00:50:13,185
Chic restaurant, champagne!

650
00:50:13,185 --> 00:50:17,178
You do things well,
I swear you were coming on to me.

651
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:22,178
Seems so unlikely?

652
00:50:26,186 --> 00:50:28,185
Have you seen the girl downstairs?

653
00:50:28,185 --> 00:50:29,185
She's wearing

654
00:50:29,185 --> 00:50:32,185
the same dress I did last time.

655
00:50:32,185 --> 00:50:35,185
How long ago was that?
Four years?

656
00:50:35,185 --> 00:50:37,176
I saw.

657
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:41,185
Doesn't suit her.
A real blob!

658
00:50:41,185 --> 00:50:44,186
Did I look that dumb in it?

659
00:50:44,186 --> 00:50:47,185
Don't say that, you don't know her.

660
00:50:47,185 --> 00:50:49,185
You didn't either.

661
00:50:49,185 --> 00:50:53,185
Does it matter?

662
00:50:53,185 --> 00:50:56,185
What brings you?
Got your diploma?

663
00:50:56,185 --> 00:51:00,179
No, my diploma was
pure chronology...

664
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:05,186
Cheers.

665
00:51:05,186 --> 00:51:09,178
Cheers for this moment, and
the things I have done for you.

666
00:51:10,185 --> 00:51:13,185
I have waited for
years to tell you this.

667
00:51:13,185 --> 00:51:17,179
Tell me what?

668
00:51:18,186 --> 00:51:20,186
To tell you about myself.

669
00:51:20,186 --> 00:51:24,186
But you have been talking about youself.

670
00:51:24,186 --> 00:51:28,178
Then, let's say...

671
00:51:29,185 --> 00:51:31,177
about my heart.

672
00:51:33,186 --> 00:51:36,186
Sophie, I'm in love.

673
00:51:36,186 --> 00:51:40,179
In love? Just like that?
No, not like this.

674
00:51:43,186 --> 00:51:47,179
It's been years.
Years of silence.

675
00:51:52,186 --> 00:51:54,177
I want to get married.

676
00:51:58,186 --> 00:52:00,177
Do you agree?

677
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:07,186
You are asking me ?

678
00:52:07,186 --> 00:52:08,186
Remember at my sister's wedding

679
00:52:08,186 --> 00:52:12,186
when I asked you to say "no",
you said "game".

680
00:52:12,186 --> 00:52:16,179
What do you say today?

681
00:52:17,186 --> 00:52:21,179
You... you really want to marry?

682
00:52:23,186 --> 00:52:25,186
For that, I need you.

683
00:52:25,186 --> 00:52:29,179
Sure, can't marry by yourself.

684
00:52:38,187 --> 00:52:42,179
I'm entrusting
them to you until the ceremony.

685
00:52:43,186 --> 00:52:45,186
Listen...

686
00:52:45,186 --> 00:52:47,177
Do you agree?

687
00:52:51,186 --> 00:52:54,187
You agree?

688
00:52:54,187 --> 00:52:56,187
You agreed.

689
00:52:56,187 --> 00:53:00,179
She agrees! She agrees.

690
00:53:02,186 --> 00:53:06,179
You will be my chief
witness at the wedding ceremony

691
00:53:07,186 --> 00:53:09,187
Thank you, Sophie. 
I will now introduce you.

692
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:12,187
My fiancee, Christelle.
She is beautiful, isn't she?

693
00:53:12,187 --> 00:53:13,187
No.

694
00:53:13,187 --> 00:53:17,187
That same dress, I bought it for her.
Remember?

695
00:53:17,187 --> 00:53:21,179
You said I could never hurt you.

696
00:53:23,186 --> 00:53:25,178
I can!

697
00:53:27,187 --> 00:53:29,187
Gift.

698
00:53:29,187 --> 00:53:31,178
It's yours. Now we're quits.

699
00:53:36,187 --> 00:53:39,186
Introduce us.

700
00:53:39,186 --> 00:53:41,187
Christelle, Sophie...

701
00:53:41,187 --> 00:53:43,187
My future

702
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:45,178
My past

703
00:53:53,187 --> 00:53:57,187
Rise, my children.

704
00:53:57,187 --> 00:54:01,187
You will now exchange your vows.

705
00:54:01,187 --> 00:54:02,187
Christelle

706
00:54:02,187 --> 00:54:04,187
My child

707
00:54:04,187 --> 00:54:06,187
Christelle Louise Bouchard

708
00:54:06,187 --> 00:54:10,187
You wish to exchange vows

709
00:54:10,187 --> 00:54:12,178
in the house of the Lord...

710
00:54:13,188 --> 00:54:15,187
Christelle

711
00:54:15,187 --> 00:54:18,187
Will you take as husband

712
00:54:18,187 --> 00:54:22,187
Julien Antoine Janvier

713
00:54:22,187 --> 00:54:26,187
to love and to cherish,
till death you do part?

714
00:54:26,187 --> 00:54:27,187
I will

715
00:54:27,187 --> 00:54:28,187
Yes, I will

716
00:54:28,187 --> 00:54:30,188
And you

717
00:54:30,188 --> 00:54:32,188
My son

718
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:36,187
Julien Antoine Janvier,
will you take as wife

719
00:54:36,187 --> 00:54:40,187
Christelle Louise Bouchard

720
00:54:40,187 --> 00:54:43,187
to love and to cherish,

721
00:54:43,187 --> 00:54:47,181
till death you do part?

722
00:54:50,188 --> 00:54:51,188
Julien!

723
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:54,187
Wake up, my boy,
your fiancee is waiting.

724
00:54:54,187 --> 00:54:56,187
Will you..

725
00:54:56,187 --> 00:54:58,187
take..

726
00:54:58,187 --> 00:55:00,187
Christelle Louise Bouchard as...

727
00:55:00,187 --> 00:55:03,188
Yes, I will

728
00:55:03,188 --> 00:55:05,188
Good, so my children

729
00:55:05,188 --> 00:55:07,188
if any know of a reason...

730
00:55:07,188 --> 00:55:09,188
I do! I oppose this marriage.

731
00:55:09,188 --> 00:55:11,187
on this marriage

732
00:55:11,187 --> 00:55:14,187
Julien is already engaged to me.

733
00:55:14,187 --> 00:55:15,187
Get her out of here!

734
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:17,187
Julien!

735
00:55:17,187 --> 00:55:18,188
When will
she leave us in peace!

736
00:55:18,188 --> 00:55:22,188
Julien, tell them!
Game or not?

737
00:55:22,188 --> 00:55:23,188
Julien!

738
00:55:23,188 --> 00:55:26,188
You've got a real problem.
Your mother died and left you in Oedipus.

739
00:55:26,188 --> 00:55:29,188
You never fucked mom,
never killed dad.

740
00:55:29,188 --> 00:55:32,187
And now at 25
you're begging instead of living.

741
00:55:32,187 --> 00:55:33,187
No, dad.

742
00:55:33,187 --> 00:55:36,188
Stop, Dad, stop!
Yes, I'll stop!

743
00:55:36,188 --> 00:55:38,188
The whole damn lot!

744
00:55:38,188 --> 00:55:42,188
Look at me,
Julien. And look well.

745
00:55:42,188 --> 00:55:45,188
It's the last time you'll see me.

746
00:55:45,188 --> 00:55:49,187
You pissed me about
once too often, now it's over.

747
00:55:49,187 --> 00:55:51,179
Over! The game,
the humiliation.

748
00:55:52,188 --> 00:55:56,188
From now on,
you don't exist!

749
00:55:56,188 --> 00:56:00,181
You're out of my life.

750
00:56:05,188 --> 00:56:08,188
Don't mind her,
it's a childish game.

751
00:56:08,188 --> 00:56:12,181
Don't do this, it's a game!
Let go of me

752
00:56:13,188 --> 00:56:15,188
What a bitch!

753
00:56:15,188 --> 00:56:19,188
A first rate soul mate.

754
00:56:19,188 --> 00:56:22,188
Isn't she just superb?

755
00:56:22,188 --> 00:56:26,189
Ever ready to get splattered by a train.
It was just a joke!

756
00:56:26,189 --> 00:56:28,179
A kids' dare!

757
00:56:29,188 --> 00:56:31,179
Julien!

758
00:56:34,188 --> 00:56:37,188
I mean, what's a wedding?
But fancy suits and champagne.

759
00:56:37,188 --> 00:56:40,189
Just freeze the petit-fours
and foil-wrap the foie gras.

760
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:44,182
I already did. You can eat it next week.

761
00:56:46,188 --> 00:56:48,188
Julien!

762
00:56:48,188 --> 00:56:52,181
You love each other,
that's what matters.

763
00:56:55,189 --> 00:56:59,189
Julien,do you hear me?

764
00:56:59,189 --> 00:57:02,189
I can be a real chief
witness at your wedding.

765
00:57:02,189 --> 00:57:04,188
I'll behave, I swear.

766
00:57:04,188 --> 00:57:06,179
I won't spit, honest.

767
00:57:09,188 --> 00:57:11,189
What's this?

768
00:57:11,189 --> 00:57:13,189
Julien!

769
00:57:13,189 --> 00:57:16,189
Julien, can I move?

770
00:57:16,189 --> 00:57:20,182
Julien, don't joke.

771
00:57:32,189 --> 00:57:34,180
Go to hell.

772
00:57:35,189 --> 00:57:39,182
Okay. But you come with me.

773
00:57:45,189 --> 00:57:48,189
We don't meet for ten years.
Game.

774
00:58:08,189 --> 00:58:10,180
Hey!

775
00:58:11,189 --> 00:58:12,189
Sophie...

776
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:16,183
Not a word, Sergei.

777
00:58:23,189 --> 00:58:26,189
Game...
What?

778
00:58:26,189 --> 00:58:28,180
Nothing.

779
00:58:29,189 --> 00:58:33,190
So, how's that
First Division offer shaping up?

780
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:36,190
I don't know,
I've not called them.

781
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:40,189
Okay, then we'd better stop
seeing each other again.

782
00:58:40,189 --> 00:58:43,189
Ditch me every week,

783
00:58:43,189 --> 00:58:47,189
and I give a discount.
I'm sick of living cheap.

784
00:58:47,189 --> 00:58:50,190
I won't spend my life
with a foot-dragger.

785
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:54,190
Think you'll keep me with
your crap apartment and two-bit wages?

786
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:58,189
I'll make money.
No, you don't get it.

787
00:58:58,189 --> 00:59:02,182
I want the jackpot, the bonanza!
The Friday, the 13th super sweepstake!

788
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:09,190
I'm at least worth that?

789
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:13,183
You sure are.

790
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,190
Game,
set and match, Sophie.

791
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:26,190
Nothing could've been worse.
Nothing... Nothing for 10 years.

792
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:29,190
Nothing for
3652 days and 3653 nights.

793
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:33,190
The match was over,
the games, the spice of my life.

794
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,189
I wandered through life

795
00:59:35,189 --> 00:59:38,190
just like in a Racine tragedy.

796
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:39,190
Hermione, for guys:

797
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:43,190
Where am I? What have I
done? What should I do?

798
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:45,190
What kind of passion has catched me?

799
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,190
What woe devours?

800
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:51,190
"May I not know if I do love or hate?"

801
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:52,190
Sophie me did bait,
flay me and slay me,

802
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,190
fuck me, chuck me,
and other silly rhymes...

803
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:57,190
And I ended up thinking
in the past,

804
00:59:57,190 --> 01:00:00,190
resigning myself
to a bland existence...

805
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:03,190
Bring me the happiness that I've never
experienced since I was born.

806
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:07,183
Love, family, work...
the satellite dish.

807
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:09,191
Racine, I said.

808
01:00:09,191 --> 01:00:10,191
Pure Racine!

809
01:00:10,191 --> 01:00:14,190
Julien! The bin!

810
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:18,183
Julien! The garbage!

811
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:31,184
Julien! A kiss!

812
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:41,190
Julien... Children!

813
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:45,184
There you go.

814
01:00:46,191 --> 01:00:49,191
What's the present for?
Shhh.

815
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:50,191
Don't say anything.

816
01:00:50,191 --> 01:00:53,190
It's for
Mommy's wedding anniversary.

817
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:57,190
Can you keep a secret?
A dinosaur secret.

818
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:01,184
The secrets of espionage?

819
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:05,191
A spy secret. Or how about... Ectoplasm!
Right! An ectoplasm secret!

820
01:01:05,191 --> 01:01:07,191
Here. Hide that for Mom

821
01:01:07,191 --> 01:01:10,190
we'll surprise her tonight.

822
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:11,190
Mommy...

823
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:15,184
Don't look at what we're hiding for you.
I won't, I promise.

824
01:01:16,191 --> 01:01:19,191
Meet my life at 35.
I had everything!

825
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:23,191
1 wife, 2 kids, 3 buddies,
4 loans, 5 weeks' vacation,

826
01:01:23,191 --> 01:01:24,191
In the same box.

827
01:01:24,191 --> 01:01:26,191
6 years, same company,
7 times my weight in hi-fi,

828
01:01:26,191 --> 01:01:27,191
8 coitions per quarter,

829
01:01:27,191 --> 01:01:31,191
9 times the earth in plastic, polystyrene,
and other non-biodegradables...

830
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:34,191
Using the packing which can't be untied.

831
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:36,191
10 years... 

832
01:01:36,191 --> 01:01:38,191
of not seeing my father.

833
01:01:38,191 --> 01:01:40,191
Bliss!

834
01:01:40,191 --> 01:01:44,184
The tyrant outfit
I'd dreamt of as a kid...

835
01:01:49,191 --> 01:01:51,191
and now adult.

836
01:01:51,191 --> 01:01:55,184
Having a speedo up to 210
and never doing more than 60.

837
01:02:18,191 --> 01:02:20,183
Hello!

838
01:02:23,192 --> 01:02:25,182
Hello!

839
01:02:31,191 --> 01:02:35,185
About 40 such
botch-ups with my dad.

840
01:02:41,192 --> 01:02:43,192
96 fibs to my boss.

841
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:47,191
Yes, yes, Dorzac, here I come.

842
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:50,191
I'm on my way.
Be there in 10 years, I mean, 10 minutes!

843
01:02:50,191 --> 01:02:53,192
Start without me.

844
01:02:53,192 --> 01:02:55,192
Monday morning traffic...

845
01:02:55,192 --> 01:02:59,185
Now 97. See you later.

846
01:03:03,191 --> 01:03:06,191
Hi, Sophie? Game! 
123 nightmares in which 

847
01:03:06,191 --> 01:03:10,185
I was a tyrant at last.

848
01:03:11,192 --> 01:03:15,185
Yeah, I'm listening...

849
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:20,185
Yes, I will be right there.. okay.

850
01:03:26,192 --> 01:03:28,192
The city had changed.

851
01:03:28,192 --> 01:03:30,183
So has death.

852
01:03:42,192 --> 01:03:44,192
489 hours in the cemetery

853
01:03:44,192 --> 01:03:48,192
hoping she'd return to
sing me "La vie en rose".

854
01:03:48,192 --> 01:03:52,185
Should have believed that I don't need her.

855
01:03:55,192 --> 01:03:56,193
We can say...

856
01:03:56,193 --> 01:03:58,193
That Mom flew thanks to the game...

857
01:03:58,193 --> 01:04:02,185
I was way off the mark.

858
01:04:27,192 --> 01:04:31,193
Sorry about this. Got the plans?

859
01:04:31,193 --> 01:04:34,193
Gimme two seconds. 
The clients are here!

860
01:04:34,193 --> 01:04:37,192
Hello, sorry I'm late.

861
01:04:37,192 --> 01:04:40,192
Let me show you the plans.
It's a 10-year study...

862
01:04:40,192 --> 01:04:43,192
6 months. Just divide by 20!

863
01:04:43,192 --> 01:04:46,193
What did I say? 10 years!

864
01:04:46,193 --> 01:04:50,193
Sorry! It's a 10-month study,
I mean 6 months...

865
01:04:50,193 --> 01:04:54,193
Hadn't heard from Sophie for 10 years.

866
01:04:54,193 --> 01:04:56,192
The wager ended today
with metronomic urgency,

867
01:04:56,192 --> 01:05:00,192
and no news, no sign of her.

868
01:05:00,192 --> 01:05:01,193
Seems she'd forgotten me.

869
01:05:01,193 --> 01:05:03,193
Not l.

870
01:05:03,193 --> 01:05:05,193
Her.

871
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:08,193
How can I forget her?

872
01:05:08,193 --> 01:05:11,193
When I see her husband all over.
He'd become a national hero.

873
01:05:11,193 --> 01:05:15,185
"Sexy Sergei" of the women's press,
top goal-scorer of the year.

874
01:05:16,192 --> 01:05:19,193
How I hated football.

875
01:05:19,193 --> 01:05:23,193
I'm on my way.
Take a right, please.

876
01:05:23,193 --> 01:05:27,186
Hi, it's Sergei.
I'm running late.

877
01:05:28,193 --> 01:05:32,186
Sorry, but that's my private life.

878
01:05:33,194 --> 01:05:35,193
Well?

879
01:05:35,193 --> 01:05:39,186
Well...
I really can't say...

880
01:05:42,193 --> 01:05:46,186
Is that the final cut?

881
01:05:49,193 --> 01:05:53,193
I don't know... I...
Do you like it?

882
01:05:53,193 --> 01:05:55,193
Yes.

883
01:05:55,193 --> 01:05:59,193
As for Sophie's life,
I could just picture it:

884
01:05:59,193 --> 01:06:01,193
It isn't like this...
It sucked.

885
01:06:01,193 --> 01:06:03,184
Right, it sucks.

886
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:07,194
Yeah, the snippet sucks.

887
01:06:07,194 --> 01:06:10,194
Sophie, we're working here.
I can't bear it...

888
01:06:10,194 --> 01:06:14,193
It was hell dealing that contract.

889
01:06:14,193 --> 01:06:17,193
Do you know who directed this snippet?

890
01:06:17,193 --> 01:06:19,193
Steph and Daniel.

891
01:06:19,193 --> 01:06:23,187
But even if it was Daffy Duck, Gandhi and the Pope,
it'd still suck.

892
01:06:24,194 --> 01:06:28,194
This is not a game, Sophie.

893
01:06:28,194 --> 01:06:31,193
Sergei! Yes?

894
01:06:31,193 --> 01:06:35,186
I have the right to refuse,
haven't I? Haven't I?

895
01:06:36,193 --> 01:06:38,185
Yes, you have.

896
01:06:42,194 --> 01:06:46,187
Then, how can I decide?

897
01:06:47,194 --> 01:06:51,186
You decide this snippet sucks.

898
01:06:54,194 --> 01:06:57,194
Wait, something's digging into my back.

899
01:06:57,194 --> 01:07:00,194
What's your teddy doing here?

900
01:07:00,194 --> 01:07:04,187
Teddies aren't
usually made of tin.

901
01:07:14,194 --> 01:07:18,187
Tell me Mr Sergei Nimov-Nemovich,
have you said hello to your wife recently?

902
01:07:19,194 --> 01:07:22,194
Not since yesterday, 
and have you Mrs Nimov-Nemovich,

903
01:07:22,194 --> 01:07:25,194
Said you love your husband?

904
01:07:25,194 --> 01:07:27,194
No, not for a 100 years.

905
01:07:27,194 --> 01:07:30,194
Nor have l
ever said ornithorhynchus.

906
01:07:30,194 --> 01:07:33,194
And I think it's high time I did:

907
01:07:33,194 --> 01:07:35,185
Ornithorhynchus.

908
01:07:40,194 --> 01:07:41,194
Ornithorhynchus.

909
01:07:41,194 --> 01:07:44,195
No doubt about it,
she'd forgotten me.

910
01:07:44,195 --> 01:07:48,187
You have to go out tonight?

911
01:07:50,194 --> 01:07:53,194
I hate football!
Dad, can you do this?

912
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,194
And this?

913
01:07:54,194 --> 01:07:56,194
And this?

914
01:07:56,194 --> 01:07:57,194
And this?

915
01:07:57,194 --> 01:07:59,195
And this?

916
01:07:59,195 --> 01:08:03,195
And this? And this?

917
01:08:03,195 --> 01:08:06,194
Can you make a girl
cry on her wedding day?

918
01:08:06,194 --> 01:08:08,194
Can you smile in the
unfortunate moment?

919
01:08:08,194 --> 01:08:12,187
Keep silent for 10 years?

920
01:08:15,195 --> 01:08:18,195
Just been on the phone with Margaret

921
01:08:18,195 --> 01:08:21,195
about her insurance story.

922
01:08:21,195 --> 01:08:24,194
I mean, I only did it as a favor.

923
01:08:24,194 --> 01:08:26,194
Just because I head the agency

924
01:08:26,194 --> 01:08:29,194
doesn't mean I'm the Salvation Army.

925
01:08:29,194 --> 01:08:32,195
Are you even listening?

926
01:08:32,195 --> 01:08:35,195
Yes? No more than
in the past ten years, no.

927
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:37,186
So, it's no.

928
01:08:38,195 --> 01:08:42,188
Life after work does exist.

929
01:08:43,194 --> 01:08:46,194
Got problems with Dorzac?

930
01:08:46,194 --> 01:08:48,195
Look at me!

931
01:08:48,195 --> 01:08:52,195
You should've married Dorzac.

932
01:08:52,195 --> 01:08:56,195
Look what he brought you,
by courier.

933
01:08:56,195 --> 01:09:00,188
The samples?
Why here and not the office?

934
01:09:01,194 --> 01:09:03,194
I'd held my breath 10 years.

935
01:09:03,194 --> 01:09:05,195
I felt like a dog

936
01:09:05,195 --> 01:09:09,195
who'd pissed on the rug,
awaiting a thrashing.

937
01:09:09,195 --> 01:09:12,195
And one Monday evening,
the blow fell.

938
01:09:12,195 --> 01:09:16,188
How is it going?

939
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:20,195
Let me give you a hug.
Come meet Julien...

940
01:09:20,195 --> 01:09:24,195
So great to see you!
And on our 10th anniversary!

941
01:09:24,195 --> 01:09:25,195
Are the children here?

942
01:09:25,195 --> 01:09:28,195
Yes, everyone is here.

943
01:09:28,195 --> 01:09:29,195
Look who's here!

944
01:09:29,195 --> 01:09:31,195
Sophie!

945
01:09:31,195 --> 01:09:35,195
Hello, Julien.

946
01:09:35,195 --> 01:09:39,188
Hello, Clo, I am delighted...

947
01:09:40,195 --> 01:09:44,188
Be right back.

948
01:09:56,196 --> 01:10:00,188
( Game or not? )

949
01:10:01,195 --> 01:10:03,195
Can't you send an email from home?

950
01:10:03,195 --> 01:10:07,188
Clo is here, why won't you stay?
Julien I want you to stay!

951
01:10:33,196 --> 01:10:35,187
Sophie?

952
01:10:49,196 --> 01:10:51,187
Sophie?

953
01:10:52,196 --> 01:10:54,187
You okay?

954
01:10:57,196 --> 01:11:00,196
Police?
Mrs Nimov-Nemovich here.

955
01:11:00,196 --> 01:11:03,196
Come quick,
the maniac is back!

956
01:11:03,196 --> 01:11:07,189
I already timed them before.
Takes a minute.

957
01:11:29,196 --> 01:11:30,197
Not that!

958
01:11:30,197 --> 01:11:33,196
It was my grandmother's!

959
01:11:33,196 --> 01:11:35,187
Please!

960
01:11:42,196 --> 01:11:46,190
10 years is long.

961
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:10,196
That way!

962
01:12:10,196 --> 01:12:13,196
Good old Sophie!
We were back in the game!

963
01:12:13,196 --> 01:12:15,196
Pure, raw,
explosive pleasure!

964
01:12:15,196 --> 01:12:17,196
Better than drugs,

965
01:12:17,196 --> 01:12:19,197
better than smack!

966
01:12:19,197 --> 01:12:23,197
Better than a
dope-coke-crack-fix shit-shoot-sniff!

967
01:12:23,197 --> 01:12:26,197
A ganja-marijuana-blotter
acid-ecstasy!

968
01:12:26,197 --> 01:12:30,196
Better than sex, head,
sixty-nine, orgies, masturbation...

969
01:12:30,196 --> 01:12:34,196
Better than banana
milk-shakes!

970
01:12:34,196 --> 01:12:37,197
Better than the George Lucas box-set,
the Muppets and 2001!

971
01:12:37,197 --> 01:12:41,197
Better than Emma Peel, Marilyn Monroe,
and Cindy Crawford's beauty spot!

972
01:12:41,197 --> 01:12:44,197
Better than B-side of Abbey Road!

973
01:12:44,197 --> 01:12:47,197
Better than Jimmy
Hendrix, the first man on the moon!

974
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:50,196
Better than the
Space-mountain, Santa Claus,

975
01:12:50,196 --> 01:12:53,197
Bill Gates' fortune, the Dalai Lama, 
Lazarus raised from the dead!

976
01:12:53,197 --> 01:12:57,190
Schwarzenegger's testerone
shots, Pam Anderson's lips!

977
01:12:58,197 --> 01:13:02,197
Woodstock, rave parties,
Sade, Rimbaud, Morrison and Castaneda!

978
01:13:02,197 --> 01:13:04,197
Better than freedom,

979
01:13:04,197 --> 01:13:06,188
better than life!

980
01:13:21,197 --> 01:13:22,197
Hello? Yes?

981
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:26,197
It's Hospital Saint-Antoine.
May I speak to Mrs Janvier?

982
01:13:26,197 --> 01:13:30,197
It's her speaking. 
Your husband had a car crash.

983
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:34,190
Listen, I told you!
He's my oldest friend, we go way back.

984
01:13:35,197 --> 01:13:38,197
Oldest friend?
And you never introduced me?

985
01:13:38,197 --> 01:13:42,191
Have you introduced your team
to me? You see them everyday.

986
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:45,197
You mean,
you see this guy every day?

987
01:13:45,197 --> 01:13:47,197
Sophie, who is this?

988
01:13:47,197 --> 01:13:49,197
If it's who I think,
I'll kill him!

989
01:13:49,197 --> 01:13:53,190
Too late for that.

990
01:14:02,198 --> 01:14:06,190
You'll be alright,
Mrs Janvier?

991
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:19,198
To be honest,

992
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:23,197
I was real mad at Sophie for that one.

993
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:26,197
I swore that once up and
about I'd knock her for six!

994
01:14:26,197 --> 01:14:29,198
And over time, you forgive.
Laugh about it, even.

995
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:32,198
After all, it's only a game.

996
01:14:32,198 --> 01:14:34,189
Go!

997
01:14:36,198 --> 01:14:38,189
Sophie!

998
01:14:40,198 --> 01:14:43,197
Where have you been, Julien?
We were all looking for you.

999
01:14:43,197 --> 01:14:45,198
I went to the toilet.

1000
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:49,191
You okay?
I'm fine.

1001
01:14:50,198 --> 01:14:52,198
A night in casualty,
for our 10th anniversary!

1002
01:14:52,198 --> 01:14:56,191
Is this your idea of "pleasantly surprised"?

1003
01:14:57,198 --> 01:14:58,198
Does that hurt?

1004
01:14:58,198 --> 01:15:02,198
No, that's nothing.

1005
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:04,198
Sorry for earlier on,

1006
01:15:04,198 --> 01:15:07,198
I don't know why l...

1007
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:11,191
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1008
01:15:12,198 --> 01:15:14,198
Everything'll be fine.

1009
01:15:14,198 --> 01:15:16,198
I'm here.

1010
01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:18,199
I don't care about the break-in.

1011
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:21,198
I just feel sorry for you.

1012
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:25,191
Damn!

1013
01:15:28,198 --> 01:15:31,198
Prepare some Atarax for me.

1014
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:35,192
Don't worry,
these things happen.

1015
01:15:38,198 --> 01:15:41,198
The after-shock.
What have I done?

1016
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:43,189
Sophie!

1017
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:49,190
Julien?

1018
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,199
Sophie, forgive me.

1019
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,190
Julien!

1020
01:16:00,198 --> 01:16:02,198
What an idiot!

1021
01:16:02,198 --> 01:16:04,189
Take me back to the hospital.

1022
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:07,199
Take me back to the hospital.

1023
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:09,190
Sophie!

1024
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:14,190
Sophie!

1025
01:16:16,198 --> 01:16:18,189
Sophie!

1026
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:29,192
Take your umbrella!

1027
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:33,190
You'll be soaked.

1028
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:49,192
Game!

1029
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:54,199
Julien! Look at me.

1030
01:16:54,199 --> 01:16:57,199
Say it!

1031
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:01,192
Hold me close and
hold me near

1032
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,199
the magic spell you cast

1033
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:08,199
this is la vie en rose...

1034
01:17:08,199 --> 01:17:11,200
When you speak, everyday words seem...

1035
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,199
...to turn into love...

1036
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,190
Sophie, come back.

1037
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:18,190
Shut up!

1038
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:22,199
It's important to me.

1039
01:17:22,199 --> 01:17:25,199
Problem was,
I couldn't quite remember the words.

1040
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:28,200
But my heart was in it.
All that could stop me 

1041
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,199
was a fist in the face!

1042
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,199
You're sick!

1043
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:37,192
Really sick!

1044
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,191
Julien?

1045
01:17:58,199 --> 01:18:00,191
Julien?

1046
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,191
Please wake up.

1047
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:12,199
Don't leave me alone.

1048
01:18:12,199 --> 01:18:16,193
Wake up, wake up!
I beg you!

1049
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:21,193
Come back!
Please! I beg you!

1050
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:29,192
Don't leave me alone.

1051
01:19:23,201 --> 01:19:27,193
No, that's too easy.

1052
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,191
You don't deserve it.

1053
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,192
Come.

1054
01:19:39,201 --> 01:19:41,192
Come and get it.

1055
01:19:42,201 --> 01:19:44,200
Julien!

1056
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,200
Do you hear me? I know you do.

1057
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:50,200
Come and get it.

1058
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:54,194
Don't leave me.
Game or not?

1059
01:20:01,201 --> 01:20:03,191
Game or not?

1060
01:20:10,201 --> 01:20:12,192
The last game.

1061
01:20:17,201 --> 01:20:21,193
We'll never leave each other.
Never.

1062
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:43,201
To win this game,
you need a pretty box

1063
01:20:43,201 --> 01:20:45,201
And a pretty girlfriend.

1064
01:20:45,201 --> 01:20:49,194
The rest doesn't matter.

1065
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:16,202
There were a few things I was game for
even if you never asked.

1066
01:21:16,202 --> 01:21:18,201
For example?

1067
01:21:18,201 --> 01:21:20,201
Eating ants.

1068
01:21:20,201 --> 01:21:23,201
Insulting the unemployed...

1069
01:21:23,201 --> 01:21:27,194
Loving you like crazy.

1070
01:22:16,201 --> 01:22:20,202
And that's how we won...

1071
01:22:20,202 --> 01:22:23,202
Together... happy for
a long time, a very long time.

1072
01:22:23,202 --> 01:22:27,195
And deep in concrete.
We shared one last dream, a childhood dream,

1073
01:22:28,202 --> 01:22:32,195
the dream of an endless love.

1074
01:22:36,202 --> 01:22:38,202
"B"

1075
01:22:38,202 --> 01:22:40,202
"B"

1076
01:22:40,202 --> 01:22:43,202
"Bollocks" or "Bonk"...

1077
01:22:43,202 --> 01:22:45,202
but they're not worth much.

1078
01:22:45,202 --> 01:22:48,202
How's it spelt?

1079
01:22:48,202 --> 01:22:50,203
Never wrote it.

1080
01:22:50,203 --> 01:22:53,202
Anything else?

1081
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:55,202
"Boner" won't work?

1082
01:22:55,202 --> 01:22:57,202
Does yours?

1083
01:22:57,202 --> 01:22:59,202
I'm sure you have demands.

1084
01:22:59,202 --> 01:23:02,202
And your children,
have you thought of them?

1085
01:23:02,202 --> 01:23:06,196
What'll they say when...

1086
01:23:17,202 --> 01:23:19,202
An orange one for you...

1087
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:22,202
and one for me.
Like blue ones?

1088
01:23:22,202 --> 01:23:24,203
Because there's only one blue colored.

1089
01:23:24,203 --> 01:23:28,203
I'll give you the blue,
as you're cute.

1090
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:32,202
and me the purple.

1091
01:23:32,202 --> 01:23:34,193
Okay?

1092
01:24:03,203 --> 01:24:05,194
I love you.

1093
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:39,196
Sophie, is my best buddy.

1094
01:25:02,204 --> 01:25:04,194
End.
