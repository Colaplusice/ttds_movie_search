1
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:44,426
M-Mr. Cash?

2
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:46,835
M-Mr. Cash?

3
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:50,771
Mr. Cash?

4
00:02:50,877 --> 00:02:51,935
J.R...

5
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:56,505
J.R., turn it off
and get to sleep!

6
00:02:56,616 --> 00:02:58,345
Change it, J.R.

7
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:00,009
Turn it off.

8
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:08,794
Guess which Carter that is.

9
00:03:10,997 --> 00:03:12,157
Anita?

10
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:13,698
- That's fine.
- Nope. June.

11
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,631
That was little ten-year-old
June singing for you.

12
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:17,362
And what was the name
of that number now?

13
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:20,103
Turn it off!

14
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:21,969
Do I have to come in there?!

15
00:03:24,744 --> 00:03:26,371
Let's get to bed.

16
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:41,626
It's hot.

17
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:44,219
It's going to be hotter
tomorrow.

18
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,059
Maybe Daddy will
quit us early

19
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:48,633
and we can
go fishin'.

20
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:52,193
We'll go fishin'
Saturday.

21
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:55,172
Daddy needs a good day from us
tomorrow, J.R.

22
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:57,573
I know.

23
00:04:00,547 --> 00:04:01,445
Jack?

24
00:04:01,548 --> 00:04:02,913
Mm-hmm?

25
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:07,952
How come you're so good?

26
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:11,919
I ain't.

27
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:15,918
You pick five times
more than me.

28
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,656
Well, I'm bigger than you are.

29
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:21,564
You know every story
in Scripture.

30
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:24,432
You know every song
in Mama's hymnal.

31
00:04:24,537 --> 00:04:25,663
Songs are easy.

32
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:28,569
They ain't for me.

33
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:32,042
There's more words in the Bible
than in Heavenly Highway Hymns.

34
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:34,978
Look, J.R., if I'm gonna be
a preacher one day...

35
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:36,981
I got to know the Bible
front to back.

36
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,449
I mean, you can't help nobody
if you can't tell them

37
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:41,383
the right story.

38
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:52,958
Said by noon
it's gonna be 104.

39
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:54,397
Them radio stations
will say anything

40
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,435
to get
them niggers off.

41
00:04:57,537 --> 00:05:01,405
Ray, why don't you let J.R.
Take the babies in?

42
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:03,873
I told Roz we'd have a crop
yesterday.

43
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:06,912
What do I say when he pulls up
here and we're shy?

44
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:08,310
You ready to unload that piano?

45
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,111
We're not selling Daddy's piano.

46
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,148
And I'm not the one in Bartstown

47
00:05:15,254 --> 00:05:17,654
drinking every
Saturday.

48
00:05:46,452 --> 00:05:49,944
Eh, what's up, Doc?

49
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:12,500
Whoa!

50
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:24,080
What, what did
that rooster say

51
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,782
when he was all
blown up by the TNT

52
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:29,384
and picking his feathers
up outside that henhouse?

53
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:31,656
"F-Fortunately, boy,
I keep my feathers numbered

54
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:34,028
for just such an emergency."

55
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:10,968
I got it, I got it.

56
00:07:16,476 --> 00:07:17,909
Can we go soon?

57
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,945
Mr. Coles gave me a dollar
to cut the whole pile...

58
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:22,036
and not half.

59
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:25,015
Go on ahead, J.R.

60
00:07:25,118 --> 00:07:27,484
Catch a fish.

61
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:37,527
The worm on a hook.

62
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,326
Drop it in a brook.

63
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:47,529
If things go right...

64
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,835
you'll fry some fish tonight.

65
00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:11,960
Where you been?
Where you been?

66
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:14,794
Throw that pole down.

67
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:16,334
Get in the car! In the car!

68
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,552
J.R.

69
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:53,804
You hear them, J.R.?

70
00:08:53,906 --> 00:08:56,966
You hear them angels?

71
00:08:57,076 --> 00:08:59,670
I can hear 'em, Jack.

72
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:02,339
They're so beautiful.

73
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:04,916
Beautiful.

74
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:07,212
Jack?

75
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,015
Do something!

76
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:12,549
Do something!

77
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,184
You know what that is, J.R.?

78
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:49,955
You know that is
coming out of there?

79
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:50,960
Stop it, Ray.

80
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:52,030
Nothing!

81
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:06,040
Nothing, that's what that is.

82
00:10:06,145 --> 00:10:07,612
That's what that's worth.

83
00:10:07,713 --> 00:10:09,578
And that's what you are.

84
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:11,240
Leave it alone, Ray.

85
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,374
He didn't do this.

86
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:13,816
The devil did this!

87
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,682
He took the wrong son!

88
00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:17,779
- Stop it, Ray.

89
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,448
He was my best, and now he's gone!

90
00:10:19,558 --> 00:10:21,958
Jack, please,
don't leave me alone.

91
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,559
- Ray!
- Quiet! Quiet!

92
00:10:24,597 --> 00:10:26,030
Everybody quiet!

93
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:38,237
You're going to miss your bus.

94
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,716
Communist troops have been driven out of Seoul, Korea...

95
00:10:45,818 --> 00:10:47,683
by U.S. Forces led
by General Douglas MacArthur.

96
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:53,652
What's that?

97
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,957
Anybody seen Tommy?

98
00:10:58,064 --> 00:10:59,554
He's leaving, Ray. Come on.

99
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:04,092
Don't start crying, Mama.

100
00:11:04,203 --> 00:11:06,728
Be careful
with that rifle, J.R.

101
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,864
Yeah, I will, Mama.

102
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:11,910
Last month, that Pervis boy
got confused and shot himself.

103
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:14,741
Ain't going to be no battles, Carrie.

104
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:16,144
He's going to Germany.

105
00:11:16,248 --> 00:11:17,442
The war is in Korea.

106
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,177
I love you.

107
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:20,616
I love you, too.

108
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:22,445
Take this.

109
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,956
Thanks, Mama.

110
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:32,196
Take care of yourself,
Donzil.

111
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:33,322
Take care
of my sister, too.

112
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:34,421
I will.

113
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:37,764
Hey, Tommy, be a good boy.

114
00:11:43,142 --> 00:11:44,404
You're gonna miss your bus.

115
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,909
Yeah.

116
00:12:57,883 --> 00:13:01,114
I saw this church in Dusseldorf...

117
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,280
made of limestone,
big as a train station.

118
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,255
We could get married there
and go to Venice.

119
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:08,155
That's in Italy, Viv.

120
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,718
The streets are made
of water, I ain't kiddin'.

121
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:16,768
Johnny, I haven't seen you for two years.

122
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:20,361
We only dated for a month.

123
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:24,034
My daddy says there's
something wrong with you.

124
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:27,306
Well... what do you say, Viv?

125
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:31,747
I mean...
I thought you said you loved me.

126
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:33,546
I do.

127
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:36,120
Oh, I do.

128
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:37,484
Then don't be scared.

129
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,818
You tell him that.

130
00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:40,357
You tell him I love you, too.

131
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:42,552
He says that's impossible.

132
00:13:42,661 --> 00:13:44,629
He says that you hardly know me.

133
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,561
Well, I know perfect
when I meet it.

134
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:48,326
Let's go, Cash!

135
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:51,900
Viv, listen, baby...

136
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:53,767
you tell your daddy
I'm your man.

137
00:13:53,873 --> 00:13:55,306
Tell him we're
gonna make a family

138
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:57,432
and I'm gonna be on the radio,
'cause I am.

139
00:13:57,543 --> 00:13:59,340
You tell him we're
gonna have a nice house

140
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:00,537
and we're gonna be happy.

141
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:01,874
And we're gonna live in Memphis.

142
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:03,642
And you tell him I'm
gonna love you forever.

143
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:05,011
- Do you promise?
- That's a promise, Viv.

144
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:06,015
Do you hear me?

145
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:07,210
That's a pro...

146
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:10,846
Five minutes was up
five minutes ago.

147
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:20,458
I am Folsom Prison.

148
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:24,502
At one time they called me
"Bloody Folsom."

149
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:25,831
And I earned the name.

150
00:14:25,938 --> 00:14:26,996
My own prisoners built me.

151
00:14:27,106 --> 00:14:29,734
Every block of my granite

152
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:31,810
is cemented by
the blood of many men.

153
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:34,038
Is it any wonder a man
sometimes went berserk

154
00:14:34,146 --> 00:14:37,638
and fought the hated walls
that shut him in?

155
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,648
Knock it off!

156
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:40,742
You knock it off
and get to sleep!

157
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:43,617
This was a common thing in those old days.

158
00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:46,623
I had so little work for them to do...

159
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:31,920
You gonna try
today, John?

160
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:34,499
Really try to sell something?

161
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,589
What does that mean?

162
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:36,827
I cleaned out

163
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:40,166
your case last night,
and, baby, all I found

164
00:16:40,272 --> 00:16:42,672
were peanut bags
and music magazines.

165
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:45,266
I need you
to think about

166
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:47,174
what my daddy offered.

167
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:52,311
Viv, I'm trying.

168
00:16:52,418 --> 00:16:56,684
I mean, I'm really
trying to sell stuff.

169
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:10,025
Hello, ma'am.

170
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:11,432
I'm from Home Equipment Company

171
00:17:11,537 --> 00:17:14,335
over on Summer,
and we have a lot of...

172
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,772
...enamel colors
that you can choose from

173
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,002
that we can...

174
00:17:19,111 --> 00:17:20,669
Hello. I'm John Cash

175
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:23,339
and I'm from the Home Equipment
Company on Summer.

176
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:25,576
LaQuisha!

177
00:17:25,684 --> 00:17:28,517
LaQuisha, who is it!?

178
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:10,919
You are late, man.

179
00:19:48,627 --> 00:19:51,619
Little higher.

180
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,563
A little...
yeah, a little higher.

181
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,997
Now play the chord.

182
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:04,035
Let's hear your E, Marshal.

183
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:07,368
There's my E.

184
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:10,175
Lulubelle, time to come in!

185
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:14,742
Jack! Jack, get in here!

186
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:16,548
- Let's go.
- Jack!

187
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:18,282
Let's go, John.

188
00:21:21,286 --> 00:21:22,310
Viv?

189
00:21:29,595 --> 00:21:32,120
- Viv, open the door.

190
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,822
Viv.

191
00:21:37,402 --> 00:21:39,495
Viv, don't embarrass me.

192
00:21:39,605 --> 00:21:42,369
You know who's out there
watching.

193
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:50,441
I want to see my daddy.

194
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:52,847
I want to go
home, John.

195
00:21:52,951 --> 00:21:54,612
Please.

196
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,154
He's just got a job,
sitting in there in San Anton...

197
00:21:57,255 --> 00:21:58,847
just waiting for us.
It's just sitting there...

198
00:21:58,957 --> 00:21:59,946
it's just sitting there
waiting...

199
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:01,150
Viv, the guys are here.

200
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:03,250
My band is here in Memphis.

201
00:22:03,362 --> 00:22:06,024
Your band?

202
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:07,359
John, your band?

203
00:22:07,466 --> 00:22:12,096
Your band is two mechanics
who can't hardly play.

204
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:16,504
Baby, can't you hear the
difference between you and that?

205
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:17,802
You have your wife

206
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:21,208
and your baby in a dump, John...

207
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:22,940
and another one on the way...

208
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:27,747
and we can't even
make rent, John.

209
00:22:51,276 --> 00:22:52,766
Excuse me, sir.

210
00:22:52,878 --> 00:22:54,345
Are you the owner
of this place?

211
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:55,606
That's me.

212
00:22:55,714 --> 00:22:57,477
Hello, I'm J.R. Cash.

213
00:22:57,582 --> 00:22:58,708
Sam Phillips.

214
00:22:58,817 --> 00:23:00,148
Well, good to meet
you, Mr. Phillips.

215
00:23:00,252 --> 00:23:01,844
I'm a singer
and I've got a band...

216
00:23:01,953 --> 00:23:03,420
and we've been
working on some songs.

217
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:05,513
You want to cut a record, son?
It's four dollars.

218
00:23:05,624 --> 00:23:09,025
What about the guys there
on the wall in the pictures?

219
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:10,788
I mean, they pay four dollars?

220
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:12,124
They're on my label.

221
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,198
How do I get
on there?

222
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:15,391
You audition.

223
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,492
Right now?

224
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:20,969
Call my secretary, Marion,
when she comes back.

225
00:23:21,073 --> 00:23:22,165
She's at the salon.

226
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:23,798
She'll set you up
an appointment next month.

227
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:25,240
I can't wait that long,
Mr. Phillips.

228
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:27,470
Excuse me?

229
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:30,412
I can't wait that long.

230
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:34,508
What about this one?

231
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:36,917
I can iron it.

232
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:38,649
John, you can't
wear that one.

233
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:39,985
It's black.

234
00:23:40,092 --> 00:23:41,753
It's the only color shirt
we all have.

235
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,191
Nothing wrong with black.

236
00:23:43,295 --> 00:23:45,126
It looks like you're
going to a funeral.

237
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,998
Maybe I am.

238
00:23:46,998 --> 00:23:47,521
Maybe I am.

239
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:12,623
Hold on.

240
00:24:12,724 --> 00:24:13,713
Hold on.

241
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:15,417
I hate to interrupt...

242
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:17,757
but do you guys
got something else?

243
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:22,724
I'm sorry.

244
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:24,392
I can't market gospel.

245
00:24:24,503 --> 00:24:25,765
No more.

246
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:29,640
So that's it?

247
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:35,376
I don't record material
that doesn't sell, Mr. Cash...

248
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,040
and gospel like that
doesn't sell.

249
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,381
Was it the gospel
or the way I sing it?

250
00:24:41,486 --> 00:24:42,885
Both.

251
00:24:42,988 --> 00:24:45,548
Well, what's wrong with
the way I sing it?

252
00:24:45,657 --> 00:24:48,057
I don't believe you.

253
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,220
You saying
I don't believe in God?

254
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:53,593
J.R., come on,
let's go.

255
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:55,563
No.
I want to understand.

256
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:58,067
I mean, we come down here,
we play for a minute...

257
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,603
and he tells me
I don't believe in God.

258
00:24:59,704 --> 00:25:01,604
You know exactly
what I'm telling you.

259
00:25:01,706 --> 00:25:06,643
We've already heard that song
a hundred times...

260
00:25:06,745 --> 00:25:10,408
just like that,
just like how you sang it.

261
00:25:10,515 --> 00:25:12,779
Well, you didn't let us
bring it home.

262
00:25:12,884 --> 00:25:17,014
Bring... bring it home?

263
00:25:17,122 --> 00:25:19,283
All right, let's bring it home.

264
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:21,518
If you was hit by a truck

265
00:25:21,626 --> 00:25:23,423
and you were lying out
in that gutter dying...

266
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:27,794
and you had time to sing
one song, huh, one song...

267
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:30,299
people would remember
before you're dirt...

268
00:25:30,402 --> 00:25:31,994
one song that would let

269
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:36,540
God know what you felt about
your time here on earth...

270
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:38,905
one song that would sum you up...

271
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,308
you telling me
that's the song you'd sing?

272
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:46,112
That same Jimmie Davis tune
we hear on the radio all day?

273
00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:49,676
About your peace within
and how it's real

274
00:25:49,788 --> 00:25:52,222
and how you're
gonna shout it?

275
00:25:52,324 --> 00:25:55,384
Or would you sing
something different?

276
00:25:55,493 --> 00:25:58,121
Something real,
something you felt?

277
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,720
Because I'm telling you
right now...

278
00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:01,799
that's the kind of song
people want to hear.

279
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,735
That's the kind of song
that truly saves people.

280
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:10,501
It ain't got nothing to do with
believing in God, Mr. Cash.

281
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:13,237
It has to do with
believing in yourself.

282
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:24,250
Well, I've got a couple songs
I wrote in the Air Force.

283
00:26:24,356 --> 00:26:27,086
You got anything against
the Air Force?

284
00:26:27,192 --> 00:26:29,422
No.

285
00:26:29,527 --> 00:26:33,258
I do.

286
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:37,734
J.R., whatever
you're about to play...

287
00:26:37,836 --> 00:26:39,201
we ain't never heard it.

288
00:29:03,248 --> 00:29:04,772
Where you been?

289
00:29:06,418 --> 00:29:08,477
Are you drunk?

290
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:13,319
What happened?

291
00:29:13,425 --> 00:29:16,189
He didn't like our gospel.

292
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:20,398
So I played him some
songs that I wrote.

293
00:29:20,498 --> 00:29:23,661
We made a record, Viv.

294
00:29:23,768 --> 00:29:26,202
I mean, a real,
real record.

295
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:33,033
We did it like,
like six times.

296
00:29:33,144 --> 00:29:35,135
I had to sing the song
over and over again.

297
00:29:35,246 --> 00:29:36,713
And, uh, and playin' it.

298
00:29:36,815 --> 00:29:38,043
And you should have
seen Marshall.

299
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:39,081
He was so nervous.

300
00:29:39,184 --> 00:29:41,243
But I mean, we made
a real record

301
00:29:41,352 --> 00:29:42,420
- of my song.
- Oh, baby.

302
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:42,852
- Of my song.
- Oh, baby.

303
00:30:10,982 --> 00:30:13,815
Never seen nobody
play like that.

304
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:46,575
Ladies and gentlemen...

305
00:30:46,684 --> 00:30:49,380
The Killer Jerry Lee Lewis!

306
00:30:50,788 --> 00:30:52,949
Get yourselves
a pine box, boys...

307
00:30:53,057 --> 00:30:55,525
nobody follows The Killer.

308
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:57,322
These next boys have just put out

309
00:30:57,428 --> 00:31:00,022
their first record
called "Cry, Cry, Cry"

310
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:02,463
- and it is selling like hotcakes.
- Shoot, now I'm late.

311
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:03,966
Oh, my gosh!

312
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:05,660
Excuse me.
That's my cue.

313
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,533
Oh, no, you...
oh, that's stuck...

314
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:08,697
right on my dress.

315
00:31:08,806 --> 00:31:10,137
Hey, Bill!

316
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:11,799
- Let me get...
- Hold on, Bill... I'm comin'!

317
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,969
- Uh... Oh, my.

318
00:31:14,078 --> 00:31:16,979
I think I hear June Carter's
voice, ladies and gentlemen.

319
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,983
I'll be right there, Bill,
I'll be right there.

320
00:31:22,086 --> 00:31:24,213
- Uh, reckon when, June?

321
00:31:24,322 --> 00:31:27,655
Well, Bill,
I got tangled.

322
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,693
- Yeah, in what, June Bug?

323
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:32,228
Johnny Cash's
guitar strap.

324
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:35,127
Don't worry,
I can keep this funny

325
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:36,200
for at least two minutes.

326
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:38,292
And I tell you what, Bill.

327
00:31:38,403 --> 00:31:40,496
He's a strapping boy,
that Johnny Cash.

328
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:43,870
And his guitar strap is
pretty strappin', too.

329
00:31:45,543 --> 00:31:47,306
Here. I love that
Cry song by the way.

330
00:31:47,412 --> 00:31:49,972
Thanks.

331
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:51,309
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss June Carter.

332
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:52,815
- Bill!

333
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:54,748
Bill, I had to come
and tell you.

334
00:31:54,852 --> 00:31:56,444
I had to tell you...

335
00:31:56,554 --> 00:31:58,454
I had to tell you

336
00:31:58,556 --> 00:31:59,716
I just can't
sing tonight.

337
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:04,089
You best be getting out here.

338
00:32:04,195 --> 00:32:06,288
Well, Bill...

339
00:32:06,397 --> 00:32:08,126
I got the laryngitis.

340
00:32:10,101 --> 00:32:11,227
- June, we...
- I do!

341
00:32:11,336 --> 00:32:12,769
Y'all laughing,
but I do.

342
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:17,938
We all just heard you
hollering up a storm backstage.

343
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:21,034
Well, I didn't have it then,
Bill.

344
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:25,379
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss June Carter.

345
00:32:33,424 --> 00:32:34,823
All right.

346
00:32:34,926 --> 00:32:36,450
June's going to be back
to sing later.

347
00:32:36,561 --> 00:32:38,426
Her family is also
with us tonight.

348
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:41,293
But like I was saying,
these boys up next

349
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:42,696
are hotter than a pistol.

350
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,267
They are burning up the radio

351
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:45,700
with their new hit,
"Cry, Cry, Cry."

352
00:32:45,803 --> 00:32:47,236
We want to make sure we

353
00:32:47,338 --> 00:32:49,499
give them
a big Texarkana welcome.

354
00:32:49,607 --> 00:32:50,699
So here they are, folks.

355
00:32:50,808 --> 00:32:53,276
New passengers on
the Sun Rocking Railway-

356
00:32:53,378 --> 00:32:55,744
Johnny Cash
and the Tennessee Two.

357
00:33:08,226 --> 00:33:10,387
Hello.

358
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:12,963
I'm Johnny Cash.

359
00:35:19,223 --> 00:35:22,715
Thank you, thank you very much.

360
00:35:30,735 --> 00:35:31,895
Viv, I'm telling you...

361
00:35:32,003 --> 00:35:33,971
I think this is the best show
we've ever done.

362
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:36,039
Hell, it might be the best show
I've ever seen.

363
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,402
No kidding!

364
00:35:37,508 --> 00:35:38,532
Where are you?

365
00:35:38,643 --> 00:35:39,632
Texarkana.

366
00:35:39,744 --> 00:35:41,336
Baby, I miss you.

367
00:35:41,445 --> 00:35:43,037
Hey, do you hear Orbison
doing our song?

368
00:35:43,147 --> 00:35:44,512
He turned it into
a two-step, listen.

369
00:35:45,883 --> 00:35:47,646
You hear that?

370
00:35:47,752 --> 00:35:48,719
Oh, damn it!

371
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,617
- What's the matter?

372
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:52,621
Damn it!
Oh, it's Roseanne.

373
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:54,247
She just ran her head
into the table.

374
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:55,347
Roseanne!

375
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,553
Roseanne, here, talk to Daddy.

376
00:35:57,662 --> 00:35:59,220
Hey, Roseanne.
Hey, it's Daddy.

377
00:36:00,798 --> 00:36:02,425
Honey, don't, don't cry.

378
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:04,296
Daddy's going to be home real soon.

379
00:36:04,402 --> 00:36:05,892
- John, I have to go.
- Huh?

380
00:36:06,003 --> 00:36:07,470
I have to go, John.

381
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,265
Bye.

382
00:36:37,902 --> 00:36:40,166
You're sounding
good tonight, Cash.

383
00:36:40,271 --> 00:36:41,636
Real tight.

384
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:44,071
Oh, thanks, man.

385
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:46,735
You want some chili fries?

386
00:36:46,844 --> 00:36:49,142
Oh, no, that's all right.

387
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:50,908
She's been in the spotlight

388
00:36:51,015 --> 00:36:53,882
since you and me
was bitin' ankles.

389
00:36:53,985 --> 00:36:55,816
They say Maybelle
had a crib at the Ryman...

390
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,787
so she could pull her out
and let her whoop and holler

391
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,858
and pop her back in
to go to sleep.

392
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,037
We're leaving
in an hour, John.

393
00:37:21,145 --> 00:37:22,669
All right.

394
00:37:24,782 --> 00:37:27,615
Aw, that's a sweet story, honey.

395
00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:32,885
No.

396
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,083
Within, like, five minutes.

397
00:37:35,192 --> 00:37:37,490
All right.

398
00:37:37,595 --> 00:37:39,256
Everything else
all right?

399
00:37:39,363 --> 00:37:40,728
Okay.

400
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:42,230
I love you, too.

401
00:37:44,302 --> 00:37:45,633
Bye-bye.

402
00:37:45,736 --> 00:37:46,760
How you doing?

403
00:37:46,871 --> 00:37:47,803
Bye.

404
00:37:47,905 --> 00:37:49,304
Coffee?

405
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:52,501
Yeah, and some toast, please.

406
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:56,206
Hey.

407
00:37:56,314 --> 00:37:58,441
- Hey, how are you?
- Good. Do you mind?

408
00:37:58,549 --> 00:37:59,982
No, not at all.

409
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:01,016
Did you lose your voice?

410
00:38:01,118 --> 00:38:02,210
I did.

411
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,880
I was just singing my
heart out up there.

412
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:08,891
I've got to ask you how
you came up with that sound.

413
00:38:08,993 --> 00:38:10,756
What sound?

414
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:11,885
That sound everybody's
talking about.

415
00:38:11,996 --> 00:38:14,464
Steady like a train,
sharp like a razor.

416
00:38:14,565 --> 00:38:18,558
Well, we'd play
faster if we could.

417
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:19,829
I guess it just...

418
00:38:19,937 --> 00:38:23,134
come out like that.

419
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,798
I got to close my register.

420
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:26,399
Oh, yeah, sure.

421
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:31,609
Thank you.

422
00:38:31,716 --> 00:38:32,842
Here's a picture

423
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,679
of my wife, Viv...

424
00:38:34,785 --> 00:38:37,083
- my baby, Roseanne.
- Oh, look at her.

425
00:38:37,188 --> 00:38:39,349
She's beautiful.

426
00:38:39,457 --> 00:38:41,584
Thanks. Got another one
on the way.

427
00:38:41,692 --> 00:38:43,023
- I got a little girl, too.
- Yeah?

428
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:44,958
Her name's Carlene, yeah.
She's about the same age.

429
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,931
You know when I was
in the service...

430
00:38:51,035 --> 00:38:52,730
I used to look at
pictures of you...

431
00:38:52,837 --> 00:38:53,861
you know, in magazines.

432
00:38:53,971 --> 00:38:55,996
Oh.

433
00:38:56,107 --> 00:38:59,838
No... no, it
wasn't like that.

434
00:38:59,944 --> 00:39:02,412
I mean, I... I liked
your music, you know?

435
00:39:02,513 --> 00:39:03,480
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

436
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:06,311
I mean, I... you were,
well, you are...

437
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:08,146
I mean, l-I kept
track of you.

438
00:39:08,252 --> 00:39:10,914
You and
your family.

439
00:39:11,022 --> 00:39:13,388
I listened to your voice
my whole life, you know?

440
00:39:13,491 --> 00:39:16,187
Me and my brother, Jack...

441
00:39:16,293 --> 00:39:18,659
we always listened
to your songs.

442
00:39:18,763 --> 00:39:20,094
Like "Swallerin' Place."

443
00:39:20,197 --> 00:39:21,459
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

444
00:39:21,565 --> 00:39:24,466
We liked it when
you'd sing one alone.

445
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:27,503
Well, you and Jack
are the only ones.

446
00:39:27,605 --> 00:39:29,004
What do you mean?

447
00:39:29,106 --> 00:39:32,166
I'm not really much
of a singer, Johnny.

448
00:39:32,276 --> 00:39:36,076
I mean, I got a lot
of personality, I got sass...

449
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,671
I give it my all,
but my sister Anita's

450
00:39:38,783 --> 00:39:40,341
really the one
who's got the pipes.

451
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:41,475
Well, who said that?

452
00:39:41,585 --> 00:39:43,177
Everybody.
My mama, my daddy.

453
00:39:43,287 --> 00:39:46,279
That's how come I learned
to be funny...

454
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,551
so I'd have something
to offer.

455
00:39:50,628 --> 00:39:53,563
Well... parents
aren't always

456
00:39:53,664 --> 00:39:54,756
the best judge
of things...

457
00:39:54,865 --> 00:39:57,595
if you want
my opinion.

458
00:40:01,205 --> 00:40:03,696
So how long you on the tour?

459
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:05,605
Another couple
of weeks.

460
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,644
We just got
on board, but...

461
00:40:07,745 --> 00:40:10,305
I tell you it feels
like a lot longer.

462
00:40:10,414 --> 00:40:12,109
I'm sure.

463
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:14,013
I'm headed off,
I'm going to the Ryman.

464
00:40:14,118 --> 00:40:16,143
Why don't you tell
your brother, Jack, to tune in...

465
00:40:16,253 --> 00:40:17,277
and I'll
sing him something.

466
00:40:17,388 --> 00:40:18,650
What does he like?

467
00:40:18,756 --> 00:40:23,193
Oh, that's-that's sweet,
but, uh, he passed.

468
00:40:23,294 --> 00:40:25,091
I'm sorry.

469
00:40:25,196 --> 00:40:26,527
Were y'all real close?

470
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,098
Yeah.

471
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,566
Yeah, he's, uh...

472
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,102
It's funny, I ain't talked about
Jack in a long time, you know?

473
00:40:40,211 --> 00:40:45,046
After he died, I...
I talked about him all the time...

474
00:40:45,149 --> 00:40:50,451
but, uh... I guess people
grew tired of it.

475
00:40:50,554 --> 00:40:53,614
So I just stopped.

476
00:40:59,163 --> 00:41:01,461
John?

477
00:41:05,102 --> 00:41:09,471
You're tired,
aren't you?

478
00:41:09,573 --> 00:41:11,803
Yeah.

479
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:16,141
It'll slow down.

480
00:41:16,247 --> 00:41:18,340
It will.

481
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:22,146
I better get going.

482
00:41:22,253 --> 00:41:23,845
It's good to talk to you.

483
00:41:23,954 --> 00:41:25,012
You, too.

484
00:41:25,122 --> 00:41:26,589
Take care.

485
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,657
I'll see you soon.

486
00:41:27,758 --> 00:41:28,850
You better tune in...

487
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:30,517
I'm going to sing you
that "Swallerin' Place."

488
00:41:30,628 --> 00:41:32,357
I will, I
really will.

489
00:41:32,463 --> 00:41:36,160
Okay.

490
00:41:46,944 --> 00:41:49,105
That's fine, that's perfect.

491
00:41:49,213 --> 00:41:51,238
Yes, ma'am.

492
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:56,151
When was the last time you heard him
moving around in there?

493
00:41:56,253 --> 00:41:57,720
I don't know.

494
00:42:07,331 --> 00:42:09,697
Thought you were going
to help me today, John.

495
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:19,799
You head out tomorrow.

496
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,207
Yeah.

497
00:42:21,312 --> 00:42:22,506
Yeah.

498
00:42:22,613 --> 00:42:26,879
Better start living life
here with us when you come home...

499
00:42:26,984 --> 00:42:29,384
before you have to leave again.

500
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:33,650
Hey, you know, I was thinking.

501
00:42:33,757 --> 00:42:37,523
You know, maybe I could get Bob
to push my dates.

502
00:42:37,628 --> 00:42:41,257
I'm happy
when I'm here.

503
00:42:41,365 --> 00:42:45,358
I like waking up
and seeing your face.

504
00:42:55,279 --> 00:42:57,509
John, those bags over there?

505
00:42:57,615 --> 00:42:58,912
Hmm.

506
00:42:59,016 --> 00:43:02,782
Those letters in there
are ten to one from girls.

507
00:43:02,887 --> 00:43:06,846
Ten to one, and they're obscene.

508
00:43:06,957 --> 00:43:08,857
Reba's been trying
to answer some of them...

509
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:10,927
but, you know,
half of them ain't even 15...

510
00:43:11,028 --> 00:43:14,623
and they are sending pictures
of themselves in bathing suits.

511
00:43:14,732 --> 00:43:16,029
Pictures for you to look at

512
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:18,397
while you're doing time
at Folsom.

513
00:43:18,502 --> 00:43:21,130
Oh, Viv.

514
00:43:21,238 --> 00:43:22,569
This one girl,
she sent you...

515
00:43:22,673 --> 00:43:26,074
Viv, you know, don't even read
those letters, you know...

516
00:43:26,176 --> 00:43:28,701
It's just crazy right now,
that's all.

517
00:43:28,812 --> 00:43:30,609
You know?

518
00:43:30,714 --> 00:43:33,615
Hell, you should have seen
last week.

519
00:43:33,717 --> 00:43:36,049
We was at the fair, and, uh...

520
00:43:36,153 --> 00:43:38,781
this bus full of 4H girls
pulls up, you know...

521
00:43:38,889 --> 00:43:40,550
and they come piling
out of there...

522
00:43:40,658 --> 00:43:42,148
and they go running
and screaming

523
00:43:42,259 --> 00:43:44,454
after Carl and Roy,
I mean running.

524
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:47,826
John... I have a casserole
in the oven and your sister

525
00:43:47,931 --> 00:43:51,731
in the kitchen, and I don't want
to talk about the tour.

526
00:43:51,835 --> 00:43:56,499
Viv, you're the one who brought it up.

527
00:43:56,607 --> 00:43:58,837
In fact,
that's my new rule.

528
00:43:58,943 --> 00:44:00,570
When you come home,
I want to get

529
00:44:00,678 --> 00:44:03,875
right down to talking
about regular things.

530
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:05,972
Viv, don't give
me no rules.

531
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:07,573
All I got are rules.

532
00:44:07,685 --> 00:44:10,119
All I got is to be at this place
at this time.

533
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,586
I'm trying to go there,
and I'm trying to be back here

534
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,214
and spend time
with you and the kids...

535
00:44:14,325 --> 00:44:15,314
and write songs, do this-

536
00:44:15,426 --> 00:44:17,394
I mean, what do you want
from me, all right?

537
00:44:17,494 --> 00:44:20,122
I got you your dream house,
all of your things...

538
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,458
all the pretty little things.

539
00:44:21,565 --> 00:44:22,793
I got you your car.

540
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,094
What do you want from me?!

541
00:44:24,201 --> 00:44:26,795
I want you, John, I want you!

542
00:44:26,904 --> 00:44:30,203
And I want everything
that you promised to me.

543
00:44:30,307 --> 00:44:33,538
Well, what if I can't do that?

544
00:45:01,772 --> 00:45:03,296
Got your mind on something?

545
00:45:05,542 --> 00:45:07,169
What are you doing up there, man?

546
00:45:07,277 --> 00:45:10,440
I'm building a bomb.

547
00:45:10,547 --> 00:45:12,777
Where we going again?

548
00:45:12,883 --> 00:45:16,114
Tyler. The
George Jones show.

549
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,654
Where was it we just was?

550
00:45:18,756 --> 00:45:20,451
Have another one, Carl.

551
00:45:20,557 --> 00:45:21,546
Austin, Carl.
That's where

552
00:45:21,658 --> 00:45:23,455
y'all picked me up.

553
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,120
Hey, Johnny, you see
the new charts?

554
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:28,095
"Cry, Cry, Cry"
was 14, I think.

555
00:45:28,198 --> 00:45:30,098
Yeah, I heard that.
I haven't seen it.

556
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,796
Wherever we been, I can
tell you where we're going.

557
00:45:34,905 --> 00:45:38,807
Everybody in this car
is going to hell.

558
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:41,139
What about the
car up there?

559
00:45:41,245 --> 00:45:44,009
We're all going to hell
for the songs we sing.

560
00:45:44,114 --> 00:45:46,139
People that listen to them,
they're going to hell, too.

561
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,514
Shut up with that.

562
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:50,951
God gave us a great
big apple, see, and He said...

563
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:52,214
"Don't touch it."

564
00:45:52,322 --> 00:45:54,313
He didn't say
touch it once in a while.

565
00:45:54,425 --> 00:45:56,086
He didn't say take a nibble
when you're hungry.

566
00:45:56,193 --> 00:45:58,218
He said, "Don't touch it.

567
00:45:58,328 --> 00:46:00,523
Don't think
about touching it.

568
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:01,928
Don't sing about touching it.

569
00:46:02,032 --> 00:46:07,971
Don't think about singing
about touching it."

570
00:46:08,072 --> 00:46:10,438
Well, what about me,
Jerry Lee?

571
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:12,406
Am I going to hell?

572
00:46:12,509 --> 00:46:16,206
No, June, you're beautiful.

573
00:46:16,313 --> 00:46:18,838
Sleepy is what I am.

574
00:46:22,553 --> 00:46:24,885
She's making me fall
in love with her.

575
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:30,189
Feel my heart. Come here.

576
00:46:30,294 --> 00:46:31,318
Sincerely.

577
00:46:31,428 --> 00:46:32,554
Feel my heart, baby.

578
00:46:32,663 --> 00:46:34,130
It's just a-beating for you.

579
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:35,220
Stop it, Jerry.

580
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:37,232
Come on, I'm falling
for you, June.

581
00:46:38,735 --> 00:46:39,633
Hey. Jerry Lee.

582
00:46:39,736 --> 00:46:40,794
Jerry Lee, stop it.

583
00:46:40,904 --> 00:46:42,132
Jerry Lee, just sit your ass down.

584
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:44,139
Just sit down.

585
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:46,675
The 1957 Chevrolet...

586
00:46:46,777 --> 00:46:48,768
- Looks like we're here.

587
00:46:51,048 --> 00:46:52,481
Oh, thank goodness.

588
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:54,642
Get me out of this car
and all these boys.

589
00:47:07,698 --> 00:47:09,359
Let's go,
home sweet home, boys.

590
00:47:11,101 --> 00:47:13,399
If you could just put those
right there, that'd be great.

591
00:47:15,439 --> 00:47:16,633
Oh, wait.

592
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,640
I wanted
to give you that Billboard.

593
00:47:18,742 --> 00:47:20,710
Oh, right.

594
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,948
It's in here somewhere.

595
00:47:26,216 --> 00:47:28,878
You got a library
in there, June.

596
00:47:30,821 --> 00:47:32,118
Here it is.

597
00:47:32,222 --> 00:47:33,519
I circled it for you.

598
00:47:33,624 --> 00:47:34,989
- Hmm.
- It's right there.

599
00:47:35,092 --> 00:47:36,184
Yeah.

600
00:47:36,293 --> 00:47:38,625
Fourteen.

601
00:47:38,729 --> 00:47:40,253
- I don't believe it.

602
00:47:43,066 --> 00:47:45,591
Um, I wanted to
give you this.

603
00:47:46,904 --> 00:47:48,804
Yeah, I just finished it.

604
00:47:48,906 --> 00:47:50,498
It's really amazing.

605
00:47:50,607 --> 00:47:51,801
The Prophet?

606
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:53,809
Yeah.

607
00:47:53,911 --> 00:47:55,105
Keep it.

608
00:47:55,212 --> 00:47:56,406
Oh, no, you don't want to...

609
00:47:56,513 --> 00:47:58,947
Whenever I finish a book,
I give it away to somebody.

610
00:47:59,049 --> 00:48:00,516
Just lightens my load.

611
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:04,180
John.

612
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,950
I just went through
a terrible divorce.

613
00:48:13,964 --> 00:48:16,990
I got a world of
judgment on me right now.

614
00:48:20,871 --> 00:48:22,771
And, um...

615
00:48:22,873 --> 00:48:24,500
it's really none
of my business...

616
00:48:24,608 --> 00:48:27,736
but you seem like
you have a nice family.

617
00:48:29,746 --> 00:48:31,873
I'm sorry.
It just happened.

618
00:48:32,883 --> 00:48:35,249
Just happened?

619
00:48:35,352 --> 00:48:37,513
Yeah.

620
00:48:37,621 --> 00:48:42,081
You wear black 'cause you can't
find anything else to wear?

621
00:48:42,192 --> 00:48:45,787
You found your sound
'cause you can't play no better?

622
00:48:45,896 --> 00:48:48,797
You just tried to kiss me,
because...

623
00:48:48,899 --> 00:48:50,890
it just happened?

624
00:48:54,204 --> 00:48:56,263
You should try taking credit
for something

625
00:48:56,373 --> 00:48:58,967
every once in a while.

626
00:49:00,644 --> 00:49:03,306
John.

627
00:49:12,656 --> 00:49:13,748
Hey, Lou.

628
00:49:13,857 --> 00:49:15,154
Hey, John.

629
00:49:15,259 --> 00:49:16,988
You okay?

630
00:49:17,094 --> 00:49:18,391
I'll let you know
in a few minutes.

631
00:49:18,495 --> 00:49:19,621
How you doing?

632
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:20,890
Okay.

633
00:49:20,998 --> 00:49:23,592
That boy Elvis sure likes
to talk poon.

634
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,464
That's all I heard
since Lubbock.

635
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:27,764
Ease off, ease off.

636
00:49:27,871 --> 00:49:29,270
Do you want some?

637
00:49:29,373 --> 00:49:30,806
What is it?

638
00:49:32,609 --> 00:49:33,906
Well, it'll just make you want

639
00:49:34,011 --> 00:49:35,774
to drive all the way
to Jacksonville

640
00:49:35,879 --> 00:49:37,779
and enjoy yourself
once you get there.

641
00:49:37,881 --> 00:49:39,712
Elvis takes 'em.

642
00:49:41,551 --> 00:49:43,781
Yeah.

643
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:49,820
Yes, sir...

644
00:49:49,926 --> 00:49:51,860
Be careful.

645
00:49:51,962 --> 00:49:53,657
Here comes Marshall
with his bomb.

646
00:49:53,764 --> 00:49:54,992
Hey, you got your
lighter, J.R.?

647
00:49:56,066 --> 00:49:57,363
Yeah.

648
00:49:57,467 --> 00:49:59,628
All right, you help
me get up in there.

649
00:49:59,736 --> 00:50:01,499
- Grab that fuse.
- All right.

650
00:50:01,605 --> 00:50:03,300
How long we got us
after we light it?

651
00:50:03,407 --> 00:50:05,500
About 30 seconds
a foot.

652
00:50:05,609 --> 00:50:06,871
All right.

653
00:50:09,946 --> 00:50:12,881
Does your wife know how much
you like to blow stuff up?

654
00:50:12,983 --> 00:50:14,109
Sure she does.

655
00:50:14,217 --> 00:50:16,117
That's why
I married her, John.

656
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:17,709
Did you light it?

657
00:50:17,821 --> 00:50:20,688
There's a bomb up here,
ladies and gentlemen.

658
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:22,588
It'll go...

659
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:29,731
Way to go, Johnny boy.

660
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:29,217
Thank you.

661
00:51:29,326 --> 00:51:30,725
Thank you very much.

662
00:51:34,664 --> 00:51:36,962
How about them boys, huh?

663
00:51:37,067 --> 00:51:39,262
Johnny Cash
and the Tennessee Three.

664
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,001
You kicked it good
tonight, John.

665
00:51:42,105 --> 00:51:43,163
Thanks, man.

666
00:51:43,273 --> 00:51:45,002
That's right,
kiss his ass.

667
00:51:45,108 --> 00:51:46,336
Hey, Jerry Lee, your
mama know you're out?

668
00:51:46,443 --> 00:51:47,501
She knows.

669
00:51:48,612 --> 00:51:49,636
She knows.

670
00:51:49,746 --> 00:51:52,374
How about that Johnny Cash,
everybody?

671
00:51:52,482 --> 00:51:54,950
- Johnny Cash!

672
00:52:38,228 --> 00:52:39,422
Okay, now.

673
00:52:56,146 --> 00:52:57,408
Mr. Cash?

674
00:52:57,514 --> 00:52:58,981
Yeah?

675
00:52:59,082 --> 00:53:00,982
There's a Miss Audrey
Parks here to see you.

676
00:53:02,485 --> 00:53:03,952
Who?

677
00:53:04,054 --> 00:53:06,113
Audrey Parks.

678
00:53:13,597 --> 00:53:15,030
Well, hey.

679
00:53:32,115 --> 00:53:34,208
Oh, get it now.!

680
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:43,119
Ray, why don't you say grace?

681
00:53:43,226 --> 00:53:45,057
Mama, it's J.R.'s table.

682
00:53:45,161 --> 00:53:47,629
Why don't you say grace, J.R.?

683
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:49,358
No, go ahead.

684
00:53:59,442 --> 00:54:01,069
Mm-hmm.

685
00:54:06,016 --> 00:54:07,210
Yeah.!

686
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:14,587
Hi.

687
00:54:14,691 --> 00:54:16,921
Hi.

688
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:25,896
You're June Carter,
ain't ya?

689
00:54:26,002 --> 00:54:27,230
Oh, my.

690
00:54:27,337 --> 00:54:28,531
Betsy Pervis.

691
00:54:28,638 --> 00:54:29,662
Hi, Betsy.
So nice to meet you.

692
00:54:29,773 --> 00:54:30,933
Well, we're coming
to see the show tonight.

693
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:31,939
Oh, wonderful.

694
00:54:32,042 --> 00:54:33,407
This is my husband, Lloyd.

695
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:34,909
Hi, Lloyd. So
nice to meet you.

696
00:54:35,011 --> 00:54:36,103
Y'all wouldn't know

697
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:37,645
where the fishin' tackle is,
would you?

698
00:54:37,747 --> 00:54:39,681
Back of... back
of them footballs on the corner.

699
00:54:39,783 --> 00:54:41,250
Oh. All
right, great.

700
00:54:41,351 --> 00:54:43,478
Well, y'all enjoy the show,
and if you have any requests...

701
00:54:43,586 --> 00:54:44,712
just holler 'em out.

702
00:54:44,821 --> 00:54:46,152
- Morning.
- Hey.

703
00:55:08,044 --> 00:55:09,477
Oh, can I help you?

704
00:55:09,579 --> 00:55:11,638
Oh, um, I'm looking
for some lace.

705
00:55:11,748 --> 00:55:15,081
Oh, the sewing store
on Saticoy's got lace.

706
00:55:15,185 --> 00:55:16,652
Thank you.

707
00:55:18,054 --> 00:55:21,114
You know, your ma and pa
are good Christians

708
00:55:21,224 --> 00:55:22,555
in a world gone to pot.

709
00:55:22,659 --> 00:55:24,354
Well, I'll tell 'em
you said that.

710
00:55:24,461 --> 00:55:26,588
I'm surprised
they still speak to you

711
00:55:26,696 --> 00:55:29,529
after that stunt
with Carl Smith.

712
00:55:29,632 --> 00:55:31,623
Divorce is an abomination.

713
00:55:31,735 --> 00:55:33,703
Marriage is for life.

714
00:55:36,139 --> 00:55:38,505
I'm sorry I let you down, ma'am.

715
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:56,383
Hey.

716
00:55:56,493 --> 00:55:57,653
Hey.

717
00:55:57,761 --> 00:55:58,955
What's funny?

718
00:55:59,062 --> 00:56:01,189
Well, you've just been standing
in that same spot

719
00:56:01,297 --> 00:56:03,959
for about ten minutes staring
at that Polly Pepper book.

720
00:56:04,067 --> 00:56:05,796
Well... well, I can't...

721
00:56:05,902 --> 00:56:08,769
I can't figure out which one
Roseanne would like more.

722
00:56:08,872 --> 00:56:11,500
She got brown hair, which
makes me think this one.

723
00:56:11,608 --> 00:56:14,372
- Right.
- But this is baby sister's...

724
00:56:14,477 --> 00:56:16,570
and she got a baby
sister, and...

725
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:19,512
Well, I got that one
for Carlene, and she liked it.

726
00:56:19,616 --> 00:56:21,311
Oh, yeah?

727
00:56:21,418 --> 00:56:23,352
I missed her birthday.

728
00:56:23,453 --> 00:56:25,921
- Oh.
- So I wanted to get her something more...

729
00:56:26,022 --> 00:56:28,217
you know,
like one of these dollhouses.

730
00:56:28,324 --> 00:56:29,689
But I don't know how

731
00:56:29,793 --> 00:56:31,283
to get it out to her.

732
00:56:31,394 --> 00:56:33,453
You want me to help you?

733
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:39,897
I think there's a lake
right up around the corner.

734
00:56:48,478 --> 00:56:51,641
- Got a hitch in your giddy-up?
- Yeah.

735
00:57:11,701 --> 00:57:15,034
Forgot how much
I like this.

736
00:57:15,138 --> 00:57:16,605
Hey, June?

737
00:57:16,706 --> 00:57:19,903
I never used one of these
fancy reels before.

738
00:57:20,009 --> 00:57:21,943
Well, what'd you
use, a sapling?

739
00:57:22,045 --> 00:57:23,945
- Yeah.

740
00:57:24,047 --> 00:57:26,607
Okay, hold on,
I'll help you.

741
00:57:26,716 --> 00:57:29,708
- It's like there's some kind of a lock on it or...
- No.

742
00:57:29,819 --> 00:57:32,185
My daddy taught me how to do this;
I'll show you.

743
00:57:32,288 --> 00:57:33,983
Keep your thumb down
on the button.

744
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,250
That loosens the line.

745
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:37,019
And then you're gonna
bring it back...

746
00:57:37,127 --> 00:57:38,958
and then you're gonna
throw it out there...

747
00:57:39,062 --> 00:57:40,256
and then when you're ready...

748
00:57:40,363 --> 00:57:43,821
if you got a good spot for it,
you let go of the button.

749
00:57:43,933 --> 00:57:45,298
- All right?
- Side-arm?

750
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:46,459
Yeah, side-arm.

751
00:57:46,569 --> 00:57:48,196
All right.

752
00:57:50,907 --> 00:57:53,603
See? There you go.

753
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:50,363
Hey, folks, what do you say
we get June Carter out here again?

754
00:58:50,466 --> 00:58:52,366
Maybe she'll, uh,
sing with me.

755
00:58:52,468 --> 00:58:54,459
- No, no, no, no.

756
00:58:54,571 --> 00:58:56,698
Now, come on, June,
I never sing with you.

757
00:58:56,806 --> 00:58:59,366
I have my slippers on.
I'm not coming out there.

758
00:58:59,475 --> 00:59:01,773
Well, they don't care
if you got your slippers on.

759
00:59:01,878 --> 00:59:03,675
Come on, it's for the sake of the evening.

760
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,146
Folks, let's hear it: June, June...

761
00:59:06,249 --> 00:59:09,548
June, June, June, June...

762
00:59:09,652 --> 00:59:12,314
- June, June, June, June...
- Come on, June.

763
00:59:12,422 --> 00:59:14,151
Prove Elvis wrong.

764
00:59:14,257 --> 00:59:17,488
He says you can't do nothing that ain't
written in your calendar.

765
00:59:17,594 --> 00:59:20,757
- June, June, June, June, June, June...

766
00:59:20,864 --> 00:59:22,832
June, June, June...

767
00:59:22,932 --> 00:59:27,494
June, June, June, June,
June, June, June, June...

768
00:59:30,373 --> 00:59:32,364
- You see, June?

769
00:59:32,475 --> 00:59:34,534
- They want to see us together.
- All right, well...

770
00:59:34,644 --> 00:59:37,044
quit that clutching on me,
and I'll sing with you...

771
00:59:37,146 --> 00:59:39,046
but you got to quit
clutching on me.

772
00:59:39,148 --> 00:59:40,877
Hi, folks.
How y'all doing again?

773
00:59:40,984 --> 00:59:43,316
I hope y'all don't mind
my bare feet.

774
00:59:43,419 --> 00:59:45,717
So, what are we
gonna sing, Johnny?

775
00:59:45,822 --> 00:59:47,255
You got me out here.

776
00:59:47,357 --> 00:59:49,257
Is that where
your plan ends?

777
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:51,452
- Well, uh... I always liked

778
00:59:51,561 --> 00:59:53,222
that song of yours,
"Time's a Wastin'."

779
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:54,523
- Let's do that one.

780
00:59:54,631 --> 00:59:56,599
Oh, come on,
I don't know about that.

781
00:59:56,699 --> 00:59:58,462
How about your hit song,
"Big River"?

782
00:59:58,568 --> 01:00:00,160
- That's a good song.

783
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,135
Well, "Big River"
ain't a duet.

784
01:00:02,238 --> 01:00:04,035
Uh, let's do
"Time's a Wastin"'.

785
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,971
John, I am not
gonna sing that song.

786
01:00:06,075 --> 01:00:06,973
It's inappropriate.

787
01:00:07,076 --> 01:00:08,202
I recorded it with
my ex-husband.

788
01:00:08,311 --> 01:00:09,801
- I'm not going to sing it.

789
01:00:09,913 --> 01:00:11,710
There's no better way
to put it behind you.

790
01:00:11,814 --> 01:00:13,304
I'm not gonna do it.

791
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:14,781
June, let's sing.

792
01:01:10,707 --> 01:01:13,335
Don't do that!

793
01:01:13,443 --> 01:01:15,673
Hey, June.

794
01:01:26,389 --> 01:01:28,653
June?

795
01:01:28,758 --> 01:01:29,986
Open up.

796
01:01:30,093 --> 01:01:31,355
June, open the door.

797
01:01:31,461 --> 01:01:34,658
Just leave me be,
John, all right?

798
01:01:34,764 --> 01:01:36,857
What?

799
01:01:36,966 --> 01:01:39,867
W-What did I do?

800
01:01:39,969 --> 01:01:41,129
June, it's a song.

801
01:01:41,237 --> 01:01:45,571
Just please get away from me.

802
01:02:49,939 --> 01:02:52,874
I think I hear Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Three.

803
01:02:52,975 --> 01:02:55,102
They'll be playing
all weekend long at the Malco.

804
01:02:55,211 --> 01:02:57,509
Matinees and evening shows,
along with Jerry Lee Lewis...

805
01:02:57,613 --> 01:03:00,582
June Carter and Carl Perkins.

806
01:03:23,573 --> 01:03:24,471
It's the candy man.

807
01:03:24,574 --> 01:03:26,235
Is the candy man
like Jerry Lee, there?

808
01:03:26,342 --> 01:03:28,469
How come you don't never try
this brand of picking, Luther?

809
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:36,444
What you're looking for,
Waylon, I already found.

810
01:03:45,528 --> 01:03:47,962
Well, hey, June.

811
01:03:48,064 --> 01:03:50,225
Hey, Jerry Lee.

812
01:03:54,604 --> 01:03:55,866
How you doin', John?

813
01:03:59,308 --> 01:04:01,674
Uh...

814
01:04:01,777 --> 01:04:02,675
Well, okay, June.

815
01:04:02,778 --> 01:04:04,109
How you doing?

816
01:04:04,213 --> 01:04:07,046
I surmise you've
never been to bed.

817
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:08,310
Surmise...

818
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:10,044
We've got a show at 2:00, a matinee.

819
01:04:10,152 --> 01:04:11,813
- You remember that?
We were just practicing.

820
01:04:11,921 --> 01:04:13,980
Oh, come on,
June, sit down.

821
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:14,988
It's slick here.

822
01:04:15,091 --> 01:04:16,615
Not today, Jerry Lee.

823
01:04:16,726 --> 01:04:18,216
Why not?

824
01:04:18,327 --> 01:04:19,419
'Cause you're drunk.

825
01:04:19,529 --> 01:04:20,461
Uh-oh!

826
01:04:20,563 --> 01:04:22,497
- Whoo!

827
01:04:24,433 --> 01:04:27,163
Come on, Junie,
just come have a beer with us.

828
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:29,704
I'm going home tonight
after the show.

829
01:04:29,805 --> 01:04:32,205
I'm not here
to look after y'all.

830
01:04:34,277 --> 01:04:35,744
You're not?

831
01:04:39,448 --> 01:04:42,281
You got somebody
to do that for you, John.

832
01:04:42,385 --> 01:04:44,012
You got a wife somewhere,
you remember that?

833
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,678
Ooh!

834
01:04:45,788 --> 01:04:47,483
What if I didn't?

835
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:50,616
There's too many "ifs"
in that sentence.

836
01:04:50,726 --> 01:04:52,159
Only one, actually.

837
01:04:52,261 --> 01:04:55,492
There's only one "if"
in that sentence, June.

838
01:04:57,967 --> 01:05:00,265
L-I thought it
was a good point.

839
01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:01,336
There is only one.

840
01:05:01,437 --> 01:05:03,837
Really?

841
01:05:07,777 --> 01:05:10,075
How dare you
talk to me like that!

842
01:05:10,179 --> 01:05:12,704
We surrender!
We surrender!

843
01:05:12,815 --> 01:05:13,804
What was I thinking?

844
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,440
I must have been crazy.

845
01:05:15,551 --> 01:05:17,781
Y'all are gonna blow this tour.

846
01:05:17,887 --> 01:05:21,379
You can't walk no line.

847
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:22,821
June, we ain't blowing the tour.

848
01:05:22,925 --> 01:05:24,222
I am not gonna be

849
01:05:24,327 --> 01:05:27,694
that little Dutch boy with my
finger in the dam no more!

850
01:05:27,797 --> 01:05:29,162
You're lying to yourself
if you think

851
01:05:29,265 --> 01:05:30,425
this is about a tour, honey.

852
01:05:30,533 --> 01:05:32,364
This isn't about a tour!

853
01:05:32,468 --> 01:05:34,570
This isn't about a song!

854
01:06:25,288 --> 01:06:26,778
John.

855
01:06:26,889 --> 01:06:29,050
Honey, let's take a picture
of Roseanne.

856
01:06:29,158 --> 01:06:31,183
C'mon, say cheese!

857
01:06:52,248 --> 01:06:54,113
What do you think of California, Mr. Cash?

858
01:06:54,216 --> 01:06:56,548
We like it. We just
bought a house.

859
01:07:33,186 --> 01:07:35,518
Lunch time!

860
01:07:35,622 --> 01:07:37,783
Come on in, everybody.

861
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:48,527
What is this?

862
01:07:48,635 --> 01:07:50,034
I've been looking for that.

863
01:07:50,136 --> 01:07:52,229
That's the letter I wrote
to Bob Dylan on a plane.

864
01:07:52,338 --> 01:07:53,430
Hey, Mama, that's
that folk singer

865
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:54,768
I was telling you about.

866
01:07:54,874 --> 01:07:57,570
You wrote it on
an air sickness bag, honey.

867
01:07:57,677 --> 01:07:58,803
So what?

868
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,609
What's so funny?

869
01:08:02,715 --> 01:08:04,307
I was thinking
maybe you ought

870
01:08:04,417 --> 01:08:05,441
to try sleeping
at night.

871
01:08:05,552 --> 01:08:09,488
Maybe eating,
maybe both.

872
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:14,082
Hey, uh, Viv, have you made
your mind up about tonight?

873
01:08:15,862 --> 01:08:16,954
You coming?

874
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,834
Okay- 'cause you're asking
so nice.

875
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:25,462
I got it.

876
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:31,706
- Hello?
- Music awards.

877
01:08:31,811 --> 01:08:33,779
We got a British Invasion...

878
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:38,112
a beautiful girl from Brazil,
a matchmaker from New York.

879
01:08:38,218 --> 01:08:39,981
We even had a flying nanny.

880
01:08:40,086 --> 01:08:42,077
In 1964...

881
01:08:42,188 --> 01:08:43,086
Hey, Johnny.

882
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:44,247
Hey, Randy, how are you?

883
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:47,783
June? Hey.

884
01:08:47,894 --> 01:08:49,691
Hi, John.

885
01:08:49,796 --> 01:08:50,854
Been a long time.

886
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:52,591
Yeah.

887
01:08:52,699 --> 01:08:53,688
Hi, Vivian, how are you?

888
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,030
Hello, June.

889
01:08:56,135 --> 01:08:57,363
I saw you got married.

890
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:00,633
Uh, yes, I did.

891
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:01,900
Congratulations, June.

892
01:09:02,008 --> 01:09:02,872
- Thank you, I appreciate that.
- You're welcome.

893
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:04,068
So you think
this one will stick?

894
01:09:04,177 --> 01:09:05,405
John!

895
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:07,172
What is this, your second or your third?

896
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,440
- John!
- I'm just asking a question.

897
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:12,111
Do not do this to me.

898
01:09:12,218 --> 01:09:13,185
John!

899
01:09:19,525 --> 01:09:21,220
Oh!

900
01:09:21,327 --> 01:09:23,192
Hey! June, wait up.
I need to talk to you.

901
01:09:23,296 --> 01:09:24,661
I don't want
to talk to you, John.

902
01:09:24,764 --> 01:09:26,755
Hey, excuse me, fella,
do you mind?

903
01:09:29,235 --> 01:09:30,395
You don't look good, John.

904
01:09:30,503 --> 01:09:33,233
Well, you look real nice.

905
01:09:33,339 --> 01:09:36,103
So where's
your truck driver?

906
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:37,233
Stock car driver.

907
01:09:37,343 --> 01:09:38,605
And you'll be happy to know

908
01:09:38,711 --> 01:09:40,338
that things aren't really
working out between us.

909
01:09:40,446 --> 01:09:44,041
It doesn't make me happy.

910
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:46,311
Well, a little it does.

911
01:09:49,022 --> 01:09:52,583
I want to tour
with you again, June.

912
01:09:52,692 --> 01:09:54,660
I miss the tour.

913
01:09:54,761 --> 01:09:56,058
I mi... I miss the music.

914
01:09:56,162 --> 01:09:58,062
I got two grown girls, John.

915
01:09:58,164 --> 01:09:59,131
I can't tour.

916
01:09:59,232 --> 01:10:01,029
So you're just going
to do a comedy act

917
01:10:01,134 --> 01:10:02,123
the rest of your life?

918
01:10:02,235 --> 01:10:04,066
You've got a voice,
June, use it.

919
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:07,003
One week a month,
that's all, all right?

920
01:10:07,106 --> 01:10:08,334
You'll work for me.

921
01:10:08,441 --> 01:10:09,908
You don't have to worry
about bookings

922
01:10:10,009 --> 01:10:11,567
or agents, or publicists
or anything.

923
01:10:11,678 --> 01:10:13,543
All right, one of
your girls gets sick...

924
01:10:13,646 --> 01:10:16,749
you stay home,
and I pay you, anyways.

925
01:10:16,749 --> 01:10:16,976
You stay home,
and I pay you, anyways.

926
01:11:35,-176 --> 01:11:35,722
Thank you.

927
01:11:36,-175 --> 01:11:38,055
That's my mama's favorite song.

928
01:11:40,-171 --> 01:11:42,263
So y'all sit down,
squat down, or lie down...

929
01:11:42,365 --> 01:11:43,764
but make yourselves at home.

930
01:11:44,-133 --> 01:11:45,300
'Cause here's
the one and only...

931
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:47,631
Mr. Johnny Cash!

932
01:12:-2,314 --> 01:12:01,283
Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.

933
01:14:-2,-66 --> 01:14:-1,-77
Thank you.

934
01:14:-1,035 --> 01:14:00,502
Good to see y'all.

935
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:01,501
It's all June.

936
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:02,593
It's all June.

937
01:14:03,706 --> 01:14:05,196
Thank you.

938
01:14:05,308 --> 01:14:06,536
Hi, good to see you.

939
01:14:06,643 --> 01:14:08,-197
Thanks for coming.

940
01:14:08,-90 --> 01:14:09,-192
What's next?

941
01:14:09,-89 --> 01:14:10,-100
Vegas, we're booked in Vegas.

942
01:14:10,013 --> 01:14:11,-89
Hey, June?

943
01:14:11,014 --> 01:14:12,-88
Yeah?

944
01:14:12,015 --> 01:14:13,073
I want you to meet my parents.

945
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:14,080
Oh!

946
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:15,514
This is my mama
and my daddy.

947
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:16,516
Hi!

948
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:17,608
How you doing?

949
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,483
It's so nice
to meet you, finally.

950
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:20,521
Hi, I'm June Carter.

951
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:21,521
Miss Carter.

952
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:23,-79
Nice to meet you.

953
01:14:23,026 --> 01:14:25,-177
And you haven't met
my little girls, have you?

954
01:14:25,-73 --> 01:14:26,019
This is Roseanne
and...

955
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,-176
- Oh, they're asleep...

956
01:14:28,-70 --> 01:14:29,-81
Ain't they sweet?

957
01:14:29,032 --> 01:14:31,-34
Oh, you girls are
all dressed alike.

958
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:32,432
I love those yellow ribbons.

959
01:14:32,535 --> 01:14:33,433
June?

960
01:14:33,536 --> 01:14:34,696
Yeah?

961
01:14:35,-196 --> 01:14:36,203
Stay clear
of my children.

962
01:14:36,306 --> 01:14:37,204
Vivian, I...

963
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:38,205
I was just
saying hello.

964
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:39,206
You heard me.

965
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:40,276
Viv.

966
01:14:41,411 --> 01:14:43,242
- Vivian, please.
- No.

967
01:15:43,-95 --> 01:15:44,-71
Oh, wait, catch it.

968
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,-62
Come on, y'all.

969
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,-162
I got these
cookies...

970
01:15:47,-57 --> 01:15:48,205
you're going
to love 'em, man.

971
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:50,370
Highfalutin'
high rollers out there.

972
01:16:-1,389 --> 01:16:01,-19
Say, Officer...

973
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:03,285
how do you get your shirts
to stay that way?

974
01:16:03,393 --> 01:16:06,658
So stiff?

975
01:16:06,763 --> 01:16:07,730
Just starch.

976
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,498
Huh.

977
01:16:11,601 --> 01:16:13,-102
It's real nice.

978
01:16:16,706 --> 01:16:18,173
What?

979
01:16:18,274 --> 01:16:19,206
What?

980
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:21,173
Are you out of
your rabid-ass mind?

981
01:16:24,414 --> 01:16:25,346
All right, boys,
good night.

982
01:16:25,448 --> 01:16:26,380
Good night, y'all.

983
01:16:26,482 --> 01:16:27,506
- God night.
- Let me take one.

984
01:16:27,617 --> 01:16:28,641
I am
so sleepy...

985
01:16:33,423 --> 01:16:34,617
That was a fun show
tonight.

986
01:16:34,724 --> 01:16:36,-184
Yeah, it was.

987
01:16:36,-75 --> 01:16:37,085
- This is my room.
- Yeah.

988
01:16:39,-39 --> 01:16:41,-14
Hey, you want to have
one of these with me?

989
01:16:42,532 --> 01:16:45,433
Uh...

990
01:16:45,535 --> 01:16:46,661
I don't know.

991
01:17:16,-02 --> 01:17:17,397
Can I have one?

992
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,-60
John!

993
01:17:29,045 --> 01:17:30,444
John, that's mean!

994
01:17:30,546 --> 01:17:31,570
All right.

995
01:17:31,681 --> 01:17:33,205
Wait, wait, wait, here.

996
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:34,340
I'll get
a good one.

997
01:17:44,-140 --> 01:17:45,521
- You are...

998
01:17:45,628 --> 01:17:46,754
You know what?
You're just mean.

999
01:17:47,-137 --> 01:17:47,761
That's what you are.

1000
01:17:48,-136 --> 01:17:48,762
You're mean!

1001
01:17:49,-135 --> 01:17:49,763
Here, here.

1002
01:17:50,-134 --> 01:17:51,390
You're a mean man.

1003
01:17:51,501 --> 01:18:-7,-202
- Don't say that.
- And I knew it.

1004
01:18:-7,-98 --> 01:18:-5,-107
I've known it
all along.

1005
01:18:-5,004 --> 01:18:-4,198
Wait a minute.

1006
01:18:-4,305 --> 01:18:-3,272
Here.

1007
01:18:01,444 --> 01:18:03,742
Come on, open your mouth.

1008
01:18:04,-154 --> 01:18:04,744
No.

1009
01:18:05,-153 --> 01:18:06,280
I don't trust you.

1010
01:18:06,382 --> 01:18:07,610
Don't say that.

1011
01:18:07,717 --> 01:18:09,412
I don't,
I don't trust you.

1012
01:18:09,519 --> 01:18:10,486
Yes, you do.

1013
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:14,385
Open your mouth.

1014
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:17,-178
Open your mouth.

1015
01:18:21,631 --> 01:18:23,496
You are so evil!

1016
01:18:23,599 --> 01:18:26,500
- Terrible!

1017
01:18:26,602 --> 01:18:28,365
Oh...

1018
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:33,-126
I best better answer it.

1019
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,345
Hello?

1020
01:18:41,017 --> 01:18:43,417
Oh, hey, Carlene,
what's wrong?

1021
01:18:45,521 --> 01:18:46,647
Okay, sweetie...

1022
01:18:46,756 --> 01:18:48,-118
I can't understand
what you're saying...

1023
01:18:48,-10 --> 01:18:50,390
you're crying so hard.

1024
01:18:50,493 --> 01:19:-8,552
I know, but you got
to calm down, honey.

1025
01:19:-4,666 --> 01:19:-3,655
All right.

1026
01:19:-3,767 --> 01:19:01,032
But everything's okay?

1027
01:19:01,137 --> 01:19:02,468
Yeah, I know,
sweetie...

1028
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:04,472
sometimes
that happens.

1029
01:19:04,574 --> 01:19:05,666
- Sweetie, little sisters

1030
01:19:06,-225 --> 01:19:06,764
do stuff like that,
sometimes.

1031
01:19:07,-124 --> 01:19:09,367
You got to learn
to be patient with her.

1032
01:19:20,022 --> 01:19:22,-113
Um...

1033
01:19:22,-09 --> 01:19:23,515
okay, well, um...

1034
01:19:23,626 --> 01:19:26,-144
tell Linda that Mommy said
it's all right for you

1035
01:19:26,-38 --> 01:19:27,259
to have pancakes
on Saturdays.

1036
01:19:27,363 --> 01:19:29,263
- Hey, June... I'm gonna go to my room.
- All right?

1037
01:19:32,-133 --> 01:19:33,-144
Yeah, I know,
sweetie.

1038
01:19:33,-31 --> 01:19:34,527
I'm going
to come home soon.

1039
01:19:34,637 --> 01:19:36,127
Yeah, so please don't cry.

1040
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:40,233
Front desk.

1041
01:19:40,343 --> 01:19:42,402
Hi, could I have
June Carter's room, please?

1042
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:44,035
Certainly.
One moment, sir.

1043
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:02,292
June?

1044
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:07,325
It's not wrong, June.

1045
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:08,596
This ain't wrong.

1046
01:20:09,672 --> 01:20:10,639
June!

1047
01:20:12,-193 --> 01:20:14,037
I'm not gonna
do this, John.

1048
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,111
I'm not gonna do this.

1049
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:37,595
Thank you so much.

1050
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,-03
- Thank you.

1051
01:20:39,101 --> 01:20:41,433
Thank you so much.

1052
01:20:41,537 --> 01:20:44,734
Where's Johnny?!

1053
01:20:45,-160 --> 01:20:47,104
Well, Johnny Cash will be
out in just a minute.

1054
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:48,107
He's been detained

1055
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:49,370
for just a minute.

1056
01:20:49,478 --> 01:20:51,173
But we're gonna keep you
entertained till then.

1057
01:20:51,280 --> 01:21:-7,111
And we're gonna play, uh...
a wonderful song...

1058
01:21:-7,215 --> 01:21:-5,649
Wait, hold on, hold on. Johnny's here.

1059
01:21:-2,220 --> 01:21:-1,244
Here he is!

1060
01:21:-1,355 --> 01:21:02,085
Mr. Johnny Cash!

1061
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:04,591
Hi, folks, I'm Johnny Cash.

1062
01:21:04,694 --> 01:21:07,162
What about that June Carter?
Ain't she a sweetheart.

1063
01:21:07,263 --> 01:21:08,594
How ya'll doing?

1064
01:22:09,759 --> 01:22:12,-148
Get it on, man!

1065
01:22:12,-39 --> 01:22:14,-139
Play the fucking thing!

1066
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:39,-51
I'm okay.

1067
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:44,353
Oh, my God, John?

1068
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,358
Close the curtain.

1069
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:48,-173
- Get a doctor!
- John! John!

1070
01:22:48,-70 --> 01:22:49,454
Pull the curtain back!

1071
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:51,032
Come on, pull it back!

1072
01:22:51,133 --> 01:23:-8,623
- Pull it back.
- Are you okay?

1073
01:23:-8,735 --> 01:23:-5,-35
- Here, here, look at me.
- John? John?

1074
01:23:-5,070 --> 01:23:-2,164
Look at me.

1075
01:23:-2,274 --> 01:23:01,004
Fortunately, I was keeping
my feathers numbered

1076
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:03,237
for just such an emergency.

1077
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:09,-187
- Let's get some help!

1078
01:23:09,-82 --> 01:23:10,-24
Well, get him some help!

1079
01:23:19,562 --> 01:23:22,-106
The tour's been canceled.

1080
01:23:22,-03 --> 01:23:24,261
Who says?

1081
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:29,633
We got your ticket
home, John, tomorrow.

1082
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:31,000
See where I'm putting it?

1083
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:34,-198
Right here
by the phone.

1084
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:42,147
Take care of yourself, John.

1085
01:24:-3,700 --> 01:24:00,726
You're burning up.

1086
01:24:02,638 --> 01:24:07,075
Got hotter places
than my forehead.

1087
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:13,-125
Tell me you don't love me.

1088
01:24:17,-48 --> 01:24:19,318
I don't love you.

1089
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:23,-178
You're a liar.

1090
01:24:23,-75 --> 01:24:27,-173
Well, then I guess you ain't
got no problems, do you?

1091
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,-30
Where's my pills?

1092
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,097
Flushed them all.

1093
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:40,197
June.

1094
01:24:40,309 --> 01:24:41,333
Junie, don't say that.

1095
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:43,104
Hold on, all right?

1096
01:24:43,212 --> 01:24:44,144
L-I need those.

1097
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,510
I need those pills!

1098
01:24:46,615 --> 01:24:49,-190
Listen, that's just...
baby, it's just...

1099
01:24:49,-82 --> 01:24:51,409
Th-Those are my prescriptions,
from the doctor, okay?

1100
01:24:51,520 --> 01:25:-6,489
L-I nee...
I need those.

1101
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:33,-147
It burns.

1102
01:25:33,-38 --> 01:25:35,396
It burns, it burns.

1103
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:41,532
Mommy!

1104
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:44,-168
Mommy!

1105
01:26:-6,350 --> 01:26:-4,284
Few more minutes, pal.

1106
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:03,625
There you go.

1107
01:27:02,284 --> 01:27:04,184
Mr. Cash.

1108
01:27:15,264 --> 01:27:19,030
You want to take these strings
off or you want us to break it?

1109
01:28:33,142 --> 01:28:35,133
Your mama was here...

1110
01:28:35,244 --> 01:28:37,712
your daddy, too.

1111
01:28:38,-187 --> 01:28:40,-94
What'd he say?

1112
01:28:40,015 --> 01:28:42,176
He said now you won't
have to work so hard

1113
01:28:42,284 --> 01:28:44,252
to make people think
you've been to jail.

1114
01:29:-4,131 --> 01:29:-3,325
Hey, Daddy.

1115
01:29:-3,432 --> 01:29:-1,297
Hey, baby.

1116
01:29:-1,401 --> 01:29:00,368
You okay?

1117
01:29:02,437 --> 01:29:07,306
Yeah, I'm fine...

1118
01:29:07,409 --> 01:29:09,206
I'll see you in the morning.

1119
01:29:34,303 --> 01:29:36,271
Cindy doesn't
like mustard.

1120
01:29:43,178 --> 01:29:45,-230
The pills were legal, Viv.

1121
01:29:45,-120 --> 01:29:46,609
You know, I got prescriptions,
it's just...

1122
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:49,309
You're not supposed to buy them
across the border, that's all.

1123
01:29:49,418 --> 01:30:-7,548
Other than that, it's... fine.

1124
01:30:-7,655 --> 01:30:-5,088
So the radio's lying?

1125
01:30:-5,190 --> 01:30:-4,350
Yeah.

1126
01:30:-4,458 --> 01:30:-2,-177
The TV's lying?

1127
01:30:-2,-74 --> 01:30:-1,-107
Baby, they'll say
anything to...

1128
01:30:-1,-06 --> 01:30:00,222
Your lawyer's lying?

1129
01:30:00,329 --> 01:30:04,629
Luther's lying, Marsh is
lying, your manager...

1130
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:06,496
Viv, I don't want to fight.

1131
01:30:06,602 --> 01:30:11,-29
What about June?

1132
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:13,371
Does she think it's fine
her new boy's a drug addict?

1133
01:30:13,475 --> 01:30:17,309
She left the tour,
Viv, in Vegas.

1134
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:23,183
Well, that explains
everything, doesn't it?

1135
01:30:38,-134 --> 01:30:40,528
John!

1136
01:31:-5,050 --> 01:31:-3,-153
John, what are you doing?

1137
01:31:-3,048 --> 01:31:-1,548
It's 7:00 a.m.

1138
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:05,-143
The kids are getting
ready for school.

1139
01:31:05,-40 --> 01:31:07,-72
I was hanging pictures.

1140
01:31:16,605 --> 01:31:19,130
John, please don't hang these.

1141
01:31:19,241 --> 01:31:22,699
Viv, they're pictures
of my band.

1142
01:31:23,-189 --> 01:31:25,336
Don't hang these.

1143
01:31:26,381 --> 01:31:28,440
No, I don't want you
to hang these.

1144
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:29,414
Viv, let go

1145
01:31:29,518 --> 01:31:30,610
- of the damn picture.
- No.

1146
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:32,414
- No, I said, please don't hang these, John.
- Viv!

1147
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:34,751
No!

1148
01:31:35,-144 --> 01:31:37,-85
Viv, get back here!

1149
01:31:37,025 --> 01:31:38,287
Viv?

1150
01:31:38,393 --> 01:31:41,328
Viv, get back here.

1151
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:44,-170
Viv, I ain't kidding!

1152
01:31:49,-96 --> 01:32:-8,635
Vivian, give me
the damn picture.

1153
01:32:-8,741 --> 01:32:-7,765
Viv.

1154
01:32:-6,-125 --> 01:32:-5,433
Give me the...

1155
01:32:-5,544 --> 01:32:-2,138
No!

1156
01:32:-2,246 --> 01:32:01,-24
Viv. Wai...

1157
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:02,243
Don't...

1158
01:32:02,351 --> 01:32:04,717
- You! You!
- Now, stop it. Baby, stop it!

1159
01:32:05,-180 --> 01:32:08,-52
- You pathetic excuse for a man!
- All right, ba...

1160
01:32:08,056 --> 01:32:09,614
She will find out,
you liar...

1161
01:32:09,725 --> 01:32:11,-183
She'll find out!

1162
01:32:11,-74 --> 01:32:13,724
She'll find out, John!

1163
01:32:14,-171 --> 01:32:15,421
You liar!

1164
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:16,554
- Stop it!
- No!

1165
01:32:16,665 --> 01:32:18,-107
You think you're perfect?!

1166
01:32:18,-01 --> 01:32:19,694
You think you're perfect? Huh?!

1167
01:32:20,-199 --> 01:32:24,-69
- Huh?!

1168
01:32:25,574 --> 01:32:27,-164
No!

1169
01:32:32,-187 --> 01:32:34,-196
No.

1170
01:32:34,-85 --> 01:32:35,212
No.

1171
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:40,186
No!

1172
01:33:-8,134 --> 01:33:-7,761
Shut the door.

1173
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:07,475
Hey, you leaving all this?

1174
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:09,015
Viv?

1175
01:33:09,117 --> 01:33:10,448
You leaving all this?

1176
01:33:10,552 --> 01:33:11,746
Girls!

1177
01:33:12,-147 --> 01:33:14,117
Girls! No!

1178
01:33:14,222 --> 01:33:17,214
- Girls!

1179
01:34:04,706 --> 01:34:06,571
- Hey, did June call?

1180
01:34:06,675 --> 01:34:07,733
Waylon!

1181
01:34:08,-157 --> 01:34:10,-98
Did June call?

1182
01:34:10,011 --> 01:34:12,673
Woman won't return
my damn calls.

1183
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:23,149
They disconnected it
yesterday.

1184
01:34:23,258 --> 01:34:26,-46
Insufficient
fundulation.

1185
01:34:26,061 --> 01:34:28,222
Now, come on, man,
I gave you money for that.

1186
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:30,059
Well, that was last month.

1187
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:31,757
This is this month.

1188
01:34:34,503 --> 01:34:36,403
You see, I'm...

1189
01:34:36,505 --> 01:34:38,439
I'm a little behind

1190
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:42,032
right now,
and-and I need this

1191
01:34:42,143 --> 01:34:44,-128
to turn my
phone back on...

1192
01:34:44,-21 --> 01:34:46,072
because I need to
talk to my woman.

1193
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:48,274
See, I'm-I'm in love
with a woman...

1194
01:34:48,383 --> 01:34:50,146
and I need to talk
to her, you understand?

1195
01:34:50,252 --> 01:34:51,344
I need this

1196
01:34:51,453 --> 01:35:-7,011
to get my car
out of the shop.

1197
01:35:-7,121 --> 01:35:-4,-46
She lives way, way out
on the edge of town.

1198
01:35:-4,057 --> 01:35:-2,423
It's the Bataan death
march to get there.

1199
01:35:-2,527 --> 01:35:02,258
You see? So, if you just go
ahead and-and-and cash this.

1200
01:35:02,364 --> 01:35:04,730
Um, I'm sorry, Mr. Cash.

1201
01:35:05,-167 --> 01:35:06,391
- You know who I am?
- I...

1202
01:35:06,501 --> 01:35:07,763
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

1203
01:35:08,-131 --> 01:35:09,359
Then just please cash

1204
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:11,029
the check for me.

1205
01:35:11,139 --> 01:35:14,370
The bank puts an automatic hold
on checks like this.

1206
01:35:14,476 --> 01:35:17,-124
It's a large amount.

1207
01:35:17,-22 --> 01:35:18,343
Well, if you
can't cash it...

1208
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:21,006
- then it's just a piece of paper. See?
- Oh, don't do that.

1209
01:35:21,116 --> 01:35:23,710
- Please, don't.
- Why, you can't cash it, it ain't nothing.

1210
01:35:24,-182 --> 01:35:25,149
It ain't nothing.

1211
01:35:25,253 --> 01:35:27,-189
Just a damn piece of paper.

1212
01:35:35,764 --> 01:35:39,165
Mama, Johnny Cash is here!

1213
01:35:42,-164 --> 01:35:45,135
Hey, girls.

1214
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,538
Hey, Carlene, you
look real look nice.

1215
01:35:47,642 --> 01:35:50,-197
Hey, Johnny.

1216
01:35:50,-89 --> 01:35:51,401
Mama, Johnny Cash
is here!

1217
01:35:51,513 --> 01:36:-8,571
Hi, Mother Maybelle.

1218
01:36:-8,681 --> 01:36:-5,047
Hey, John.

1219
01:36:-5,150 --> 01:36:-4,583
How are you doing?

1220
01:36:-4,685 --> 01:36:-1,745
I'm doing all right.

1221
01:36:00,-146 --> 01:36:02,-212
Hi, June.

1222
01:36:02,-110 --> 01:36:03,016
Hi, John.

1223
01:36:03,124 --> 01:36:04,318
Hey, girls...

1224
01:36:04,426 --> 01:36:06,690
can you go inside the living
room and clean up that mess?

1225
01:36:07,-205 --> 01:36:08,319
All right, honey.

1226
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:10,762
I tried to call, June, but I
think there's something wrong

1227
01:36:11,-135 --> 01:36:12,-146
with your phone.

1228
01:36:12,-33 --> 01:36:14,060
Look at you.

1229
01:36:14,169 --> 01:36:16,262
Have you looked
in a mirror lately?

1230
01:36:16,371 --> 01:36:19,135
How are you gonna sing,
when you can't even talk?

1231
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,231
I got the laryngitis.

1232
01:36:21,343 --> 01:36:24,-63
Remember?

1233
01:36:24,045 --> 01:36:25,569
Marry me, June.

1234
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:26,704
Oh, please.

1235
01:36:27,-185 --> 01:36:28,373
Get up off your knees.
You look pathetic.

1236
01:36:28,483 --> 01:36:29,609
Come on.

1237
01:36:29,718 --> 01:36:31,583
I don't want my girls
seeing somebody like this.

1238
01:36:31,686 --> 01:36:34,120
Come on, baby.

1239
01:36:34,222 --> 01:36:35,621
Where's my friend John?

1240
01:36:35,724 --> 01:36:37,555
What, did he get high?

1241
01:36:37,659 --> 01:36:39,-181
Or is he incognito?

1242
01:36:39,-73 --> 01:36:40,-49
Is he gone?

1243
01:36:40,061 --> 01:36:42,120
'Cause I don't like
this guy, Cash.

1244
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:45,256
I ain't incognito.

1245
01:36:45,367 --> 01:36:47,164
I'm right here.

1246
01:36:47,268 --> 01:36:49,065
You see?
I'm here.

1247
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:51,661
Fine, where's your car?

1248
01:37:-8,-227 --> 01:37:-7,138
Kiss and make up.

1249
01:37:-7,241 --> 01:37:-5,072
You walked here?

1250
01:37:-5,176 --> 01:37:-4,541
Yeah.

1251
01:37:-4,645 --> 01:37:-1,-23
You walked here all
the way from Nashville?

1252
01:37:-1,080 --> 01:37:01,071
Yeah, walking's
good for you.

1253
01:37:01,182 --> 01:37:03,207
See, I'm trying to
get into shape, June.

1254
01:37:03,318 --> 01:37:05,445
It cleans out your system.

1255
01:37:05,553 --> 01:37:07,145
Well, it's a spiritual thing.

1256
01:37:07,255 --> 01:37:09,723
I'm on a love walk.

1257
01:37:10,-176 --> 01:37:11,758
The June Carter Love Walk.

1258
01:37:12,-140 --> 01:37:13,725
- And memorial.
- You know what?

1259
01:37:14,-172 --> 01:37:16,353
I'm supporting
more than myself right now.

1260
01:37:16,464 --> 01:37:18,625
Please, do not blow
another tour.

1261
01:37:18,733 --> 01:37:21,-140
Aw, June, love's more
important than a tour.

1262
01:37:21,-31 --> 01:37:22,300
- Is that right?
- Yes, it is.

1263
01:37:22,404 --> 01:37:24,634
Well, then start
loving yourself...

1264
01:37:24,739 --> 01:37:27,606
so we can go
back to work.

1265
01:37:27,709 --> 01:37:29,677
All right, June.

1266
01:37:30,-222 --> 01:37:32,576
Hey, you keep your phone on,
and I will, too.

1267
01:37:32,681 --> 01:37:34,342
I'll call.

1268
01:37:36,484 --> 01:37:39,647
I'll call you.

1269
01:37:39,754 --> 01:37:42,222
When you're feeling better,
I'll call.

1270
01:39:10,078 --> 01:39:12,740
Hey, that's a beautiful house!

1271
01:39:25,727 --> 01:39:29,026
Hey, man.

1272
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:30,392
Beautiful place, man.

1273
01:39:30,498 --> 01:39:32,227
- Yeah? Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

1274
01:39:42,744 --> 01:39:43,711
Hello.

1275
01:39:44,-188 --> 01:39:46,280
June? Hey, it's John.

1276
01:39:46,381 --> 01:39:47,507
Hey.

1277
01:39:47,615 --> 01:39:49,-157
Hey.

1278
01:39:49,-50 --> 01:39:50,281
How you doing?

1279
01:39:50,385 --> 01:40:-7,513
I'm fine, John,
how are you?

1280
01:40:-7,621 --> 01:40:-3,-114
Uh, yeah, doing a lot better
than the last time you saw me.

1281
01:40:-3,-09 --> 01:40:-2,049
Well, that's good.

1282
01:40:-2,159 --> 01:40:-1,683
I'm glad to hear that.

1283
01:40:00,-206 --> 01:40:02,-11
You still taking those pills?

1284
01:40:02,096 --> 01:40:03,654
No, that was...

1285
01:40:03,765 --> 01:40:06,097
no, that was
a rough patch, uh, June.

1286
01:40:06,201 --> 01:40:09,762
I just needed to, uh,
you know, get some time.

1287
01:40:10,-129 --> 01:40:11,304
I'm doing better, though, now,
you know?

1288
01:40:11,406 --> 01:40:15,-102
I, uh, got out of that apartment
and got this place

1289
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:16,476
out in Hendersonville
on a lake.

1290
01:40:16,578 --> 01:40:18,011
Big spread.

1291
01:40:18,112 --> 01:40:19,477
I heard that.

1292
01:40:19,581 --> 01:40:23,608
Yeah, I'm...
trying to get things together.

1293
01:40:23,718 --> 01:40:26,186
Mm-hmm.

1294
01:40:26,287 --> 01:40:29,279
Are you alone
on Thanksgiving, John?

1295
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:31,517
Yeah.

1296
01:40:31,626 --> 01:40:34,-179
My folks are coming down
with Reba and Roseanne...

1297
01:40:34,-72 --> 01:40:36,-13
and, uh, I got this big bird...

1298
01:40:36,097 --> 01:40:38,429
but I don't know
when to put it in the oven

1299
01:40:38,533 --> 01:40:41,-33
or really what temperature
to set it at or...

1300
01:40:41,069 --> 01:40:42,661
Uh-huh.

1301
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:46,640
It is beautiful.

1302
01:40:46,741 --> 01:40:48,003
Really lucky.

1303
01:40:48,109 --> 01:40:49,201
I'm really
proud of you.

1304
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:51,073
- You see, it goes from right up there...
- Mm-hmm.

1305
01:40:51,179 --> 01:41:-8,407
Clear across
halfway around the lake.

1306
01:41:-8,513 --> 01:41:-7,639
Yeah.

1307
01:41:-7,748 --> 01:41:-5,682
What's going on down
there with that tractor?

1308
01:41:-2,-215 --> 01:41:00,276
Uh, I got it stuck.

1309
01:41:00,388 --> 01:41:03,-144
I was trying to pull out
that stump, and I couldn't...

1310
01:41:03,-43 --> 01:41:04,481
- Doing something dangerous.
- Yeah, but...

1311
01:41:04,592 --> 01:41:06,082
That's a fine
piece of equipment

1312
01:41:06,194 --> 01:41:07,684
to leave sinking
in that mud.

1313
01:41:08,-205 --> 01:41:11,-145
Is that the way you
take care of your things?

1314
01:41:13,-66 --> 01:41:15,402
Well...

1315
01:41:15,503 --> 01:41:17,494
Hey.

1316
01:41:19,641 --> 01:41:21,541
- Hey!
- There's John.

1317
01:41:21,643 --> 01:41:23,-26
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Oh!

1318
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:24,704
Here, Carlene.

1319
01:41:25,-188 --> 01:41:26,473
- Happy Thanksgiving!
- Hello, John.

1320
01:41:26,581 --> 01:41:28,-54
- Hi.
- I like this place out here.

1321
01:41:28,049 --> 01:41:29,073
Oh, thanks.

1322
01:41:29,183 --> 01:41:30,707
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Hey, Rosie.

1323
01:41:31,-182 --> 01:41:32,-215
Thank you.

1324
01:41:32,-114 --> 01:41:33,547
- Hey.
- Let's go over and meet John's...

1325
01:41:33,655 --> 01:41:35,122
House is beautiful.

1326
01:41:35,223 --> 01:41:37,521
Thanks. Thanks for coming.

1327
01:41:37,625 --> 01:41:39,-181
Hey, how you folks doing?

1328
01:41:39,-73 --> 01:41:40,690
- John, how are you doing?
- Let me help you out.

1329
01:41:41,-205 --> 01:41:42,-147
- All right.
- Oh, thank you, Carrie.

1330
01:41:42,-37 --> 01:41:43,055
Mother Maybelle,
that's my mama, Carrie.

1331
01:41:43,164 --> 01:41:44,358
Maybelle Carter,
happy to meet you.

1332
01:41:44,465 --> 01:41:45,693
This is my daddy...

1333
01:41:46,-200 --> 01:41:46,698
- Ray.
- Ray, how you doing?

1334
01:41:47,-199 --> 01:41:48,325
- How are you doing?
- Good to meet you.

1335
01:41:48,436 --> 01:41:50,-06
- My mama, Carrie.
- How are you doing?

1336
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:51,628
Carrie was going to cook
for y'all, but, uh...

1337
01:41:51,739 --> 01:42:-6,537
J.R., he doesn't have
a pot or a pan, so...

1338
01:42:-6,642 --> 01:42:-4,405
Well, we're more than happy to
share our food with you folks.

1339
01:42:-4,511 --> 01:42:-3,569
I just moved in, you know?

1340
01:42:-3,679 --> 01:42:-1,-59
- Okay, thanks, Carrie.
- Come on inside.

1341
01:42:-1,047 --> 01:42:01,-122
If you're gonna get out
on some big water

1342
01:42:01,-18 --> 01:42:03,507
like the lakes or river,
you're gonna need something

1343
01:42:03,618 --> 01:42:05,609
that you can cast out there
a pretty good ways.

1344
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:09,053
Now if you haven't gotten one
yet, what I want to tell you is...

1345
01:42:09,157 --> 01:42:10,681
you need to get you
a Zebco 33.

1346
01:42:11,-208 --> 01:42:12,589
That's about the best
reel that you can get.

1347
01:42:12,694 --> 01:42:13,626
They don't tangle up

1348
01:42:13,728 --> 01:42:15,025
very much, and you
can cast 'em

1349
01:42:15,129 --> 01:42:17,-142
about as far
as you want to throw 'em.

1350
01:42:17,-35 --> 01:42:19,024
Of course, around the house
there, them little farm ponds...

1351
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:21,-104
you don't need nothing
but a cane pole and a float...

1352
01:42:21,002 --> 01:42:24,631
and maybe some crickets or
worms, if you can dig them up.

1353
01:42:24,739 --> 01:42:26,070
That's all we ever had.

1354
01:42:26,174 --> 01:42:27,471
Zebco 33 is probably
your best bet.

1355
01:42:27,575 --> 01:42:28,667
I bought June one

1356
01:42:29,-224 --> 01:42:31,-29
when she was about 12 years old.
You remember that?

1357
01:42:31,079 --> 01:42:33,-21
- That's right, I caught a lot of fish with that.
- Mm-hmm.

1358
01:42:33,081 --> 01:42:35,276
You sure did.

1359
01:42:35,383 --> 01:42:38,113
So wha...
what do you think, Daddy?

1360
01:42:38,219 --> 01:42:41,245
About what?

1361
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:44,689
About the house.

1362
01:42:50,531 --> 01:43:-8,294
It's a fine,
big house, John.

1363
01:43:-6,369 --> 01:43:-5,563
It's not as big

1364
01:43:-5,670 --> 01:43:-3,001
as Jack Benny's.

1365
01:43:-3,105 --> 01:43:00,-165
You been to Jack Benny's, Ray?

1366
01:43:00,-59 --> 01:43:02,171
Saw it on the TV.

1367
01:43:02,276 --> 01:43:04,-166
Carrie, I was meaning to ask you...

1368
01:43:04,-55 --> 01:43:05,-66
did you teach the boys

1369
01:43:05,046 --> 01:43:06,343
to play?

1370
01:43:06,447 --> 01:43:09,177
Well, J.R.
Always sang pretty...

1371
01:43:09,283 --> 01:43:11,308
but I don't think
I could take credit for it.

1372
01:43:11,419 --> 01:43:12,613
I bet you did.

1373
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,415
I bet you learned
the same way I did.

1374
01:43:14,522 --> 01:43:16,-11
- Oh, out of the hymnals, sure.
- Hymnals.

1375
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:18,422
I knew you'd
say that.

1376
01:43:18,526 --> 01:43:20,-212
But you know,
you'd be surprised

1377
01:43:20,-106 --> 01:43:21,452
how many musicians
can't read

1378
01:43:21,562 --> 01:43:22,494
shaped notes nowadays.

1379
01:43:22,597 --> 01:43:23,757
I can't imagine.

1380
01:43:24,-135 --> 01:43:25,423
I know, I know, but my husband's uncle...

1381
01:43:25,533 --> 01:43:28,468
E.M. Bays, he taught me
with hymnals, too.

1382
01:43:28,569 --> 01:43:30,264
How about you, John?
You know how to read

1383
01:43:30,371 --> 01:43:34,273
shaped notes?

1384
01:43:34,375 --> 01:43:36,468
John?

1385
01:43:36,577 --> 01:43:38,602
Mama asked you
a question, John.

1386
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:42,-22
I'm really glad
y'all could be here today...

1387
01:43:42,083 --> 01:43:44,051
especially you, Daddy.

1388
01:43:44,152 --> 01:43:45,551
I'm glad you came.

1389
01:43:45,653 --> 01:43:48,645
To dinner, and
Thanksgiving and all.

1390
01:44:-6,429 --> 01:44:-3,455
Not everybody's here.

1391
01:44:01,-198 --> 01:44:04,-172
Jack's not here, is he?

1392
01:44:04,-62 --> 01:44:07,135
Huh?

1393
01:44:09,277 --> 01:44:11,370
"Where you been?"

1394
01:44:15,-118 --> 01:44:16,281
That's what you said to me.

1395
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,351
Remember?

1396
01:44:22,523 --> 01:44:24,514
And I was 12 years old.

1397
01:44:26,661 --> 01:44:31,030
You's got Jack's
bloody clothes...

1398
01:44:31,132 --> 01:44:33,532
And you said to me,
"Where you been?"

1399
01:44:35,136 --> 01:44:37,730
Well?

1400
01:44:38,-161 --> 01:44:39,272
Where were you?

1401
01:44:41,-125 --> 01:44:43,-66
Where were you?

1402
01:44:48,583 --> 01:44:51,746
I quit drinking
a long time ago, J.R.

1403
01:45:-8,-147 --> 01:45:-8,751
What about you?

1404
01:45:-7,-146 --> 01:45:-5,414
You still taking them pills?

1405
01:45:-5,523 --> 01:45:-4,512
That'll kill you, ya know.

1406
01:45:-4,624 --> 01:45:00,082
Yeah, well, so will a car wreck.

1407
01:45:02,063 --> 01:45:06,363
You're sitting
on a high horse, boy.

1408
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:07,399
I never had talent;

1409
01:45:07,502 --> 01:45:09,697
I did the best I could
with what I had.

1410
01:45:10,-196 --> 01:45:12,-137
Can you say that?

1411
01:45:12,-27 --> 01:45:13,-38
Mr. Big Shot.

1412
01:45:13,074 --> 01:45:14,268
Mr. Pill-popping rock star?

1413
01:45:14,375 --> 01:45:16,-135
Ray.

1414
01:45:16,-23 --> 01:45:17,-91
Who are you
to judge?

1415
01:45:17,011 --> 01:45:18,638
You ain't got nothin'.

1416
01:45:18,746 --> 01:45:20,213
Big, empty house.

1417
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:21,212
Nothin'.

1418
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:23,010
Children
you don't see.

1419
01:45:23,117 --> 01:45:24,744
Nothing.

1420
01:45:25,-148 --> 01:45:28,253
Big old, expensive tractor
stuck in the mud.

1421
01:45:28,356 --> 01:45:29,254
Ray...

1422
01:45:29,357 --> 01:45:30,324
Nothin'.

1423
01:46:-7,281 --> 01:46:-6,248
Come on!

1424
01:46:-4,584 --> 01:46:-2,347
Do it!

1425
01:46:-2,452 --> 01:46:00,147
Come on...

1426
01:46:00,254 --> 01:46:02,279
You son of a bitch, you.

1427
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:03,379
Come on!

1428
01:46:06,627 --> 01:46:07,594
Do it!
Do it!

1429
01:46:07,695 --> 01:46:10,061
Come on!

1430
01:46:12,-134 --> 01:46:13,299
Come on!

1431
01:46:19,-227 --> 01:46:20,638
Sit in the middle this time.

1432
01:46:20,741 --> 01:46:22,368
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1433
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:25,436
John?

1434
01:46:25,546 --> 01:46:27,-89
Oh, here's a fine
piece of equipment!

1435
01:46:27,014 --> 01:46:28,-19
John!

1436
01:46:32,-14 --> 01:46:34,147
You should go down there to him, June.

1437
01:46:34,255 --> 01:46:35,153
Mama.

1438
01:46:35,256 --> 01:46:36,348
He's mixed up.

1439
01:46:36,457 --> 01:46:37,287
I am not going down there.

1440
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:38,221
If I go down...

1441
01:46:38,326 --> 01:46:40,317
You already are
down there, honey.

1442
01:46:49,-164 --> 01:46:50,064
Do it!
Do it!

1443
01:47:-8,-27 --> 01:47:-7,-60
More, more, more!

1444
01:47:-5,476 --> 01:47:-4,568
John!

1445
01:47:02,350 --> 01:47:03,248
John!

1446
01:47:04,652 --> 01:47:05,550
John!

1447
01:47:06,654 --> 01:47:07,552
John!

1448
01:47:07,655 --> 01:47:09,054
Ah!

1449
01:47:09,156 --> 01:47:10,123
John!

1450
01:47:10,625 --> 01:47:11,557
John.

1451
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:20,592
June?

1452
01:47:20,701 --> 01:47:21,599
Come on.

1453
01:47:35,-118 --> 01:47:38,113
You should have left me.

1454
01:48:50,-176 --> 01:48:51,291
John?

1455
01:48:51,392 --> 01:49:-6,486
Go on ahead, J.R.

1456
01:49:-6,595 --> 01:49:-3,621
You know what that is, J.R.?

1457
01:49:-3,732 --> 01:49:00,633
Just please, get away from me.!

1458
01:49:00,735 --> 01:49:02,-207
Daddy?

1459
01:49:02,-98 --> 01:49:03,199
John?

1460
01:49:05,272 --> 01:49:06,705
Hey, John?

1461
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:09,-192
Oh, shit! Jesus!

1462
01:49:09,-91 --> 01:49:10,-193
Hey! What?

1463
01:49:10,-90 --> 01:49:11,-192
Hey, John?

1464
01:49:11,-89 --> 01:49:12,310
Get your ass
out of here, boy!

1465
01:49:12,413 --> 01:49:13,311
Hey, John!

1466
01:49:13,414 --> 01:49:14,608
Get out of here!

1467
01:49:14,715 --> 01:49:16,-125
Take your poison with you!

1468
01:49:16,-17 --> 01:49:17,-50
Okay!

1469
01:49:37,037 --> 01:49:38,004
Hey.

1470
01:49:42,343 --> 01:49:45,278
Mama and I picked these up
down the road.

1471
01:49:45,379 --> 01:49:47,-63
They're good.

1472
01:50:11,-195 --> 01:50:13,-204
It's good to see you again.

1473
01:50:14,-59 --> 01:50:16,466
Can I get you
something else?

1474
01:50:16,577 --> 01:50:19,-193
Just stay.

1475
01:50:20,-53 --> 01:50:21,346
Okay.

1476
01:50:25,-181 --> 01:50:27,117
You're an angel.

1477
01:50:29,523 --> 01:50:30,717
No, I'm not.

1478
01:50:31,-175 --> 01:50:33,316
You been here with me.

1479
01:50:35,-38 --> 01:50:37,-207
I had a friend
who needed help.

1480
01:50:38,365 --> 01:50:40,-08
You're my friend.

1481
01:50:42,436 --> 01:50:46,031
But I done so many bad things.

1482
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:47,368
You done a few.

1483
01:50:47,475 --> 01:50:49,-194
That's true.

1484
01:51:-7,280 --> 01:51:-3,239
My daddy's right.

1485
01:51:-3,351 --> 01:51:00,013
Should have been me on that saw.

1486
01:51:07,094 --> 01:51:10,530
Jack was so good.

1487
01:51:10,631 --> 01:51:14,-104
He would have done
so many good things.

1488
01:51:14,001 --> 01:51:18,-97
What have I done?

1489
01:51:18,005 --> 01:51:21,-162
Just hurt everybody I know.

1490
01:51:25,-155 --> 01:51:27,075
I know
I've hurt you.

1491
01:51:34,421 --> 01:51:35,683
I'm nothing.

1492
01:51:39,393 --> 01:51:41,020
You're not nothing.

1493
01:51:44,064 --> 01:51:45,656
You are not nothing.

1494
01:51:48,-199 --> 01:51:50,-140
You're a good man.

1495
01:51:51,272 --> 01:52:-8,466
And God has
given you

1496
01:52:-8,573 --> 01:52:-3,-229
a second chance
to make things right, John.

1497
01:52:-3,-123 --> 01:52:-1,038
This is your chance, honey.

1498
01:52:03,-117 --> 01:52:05,647
This is your chance.

1499
01:52:24,104 --> 01:52:25,002
Morning.

1500
01:52:25,105 --> 01:52:26,572
Hi, how are y'all?

1501
01:52:31,045 --> 01:52:32,342
Hey, June?

1502
01:52:35,149 --> 01:52:36,047
It's okay.

1503
01:52:37,484 --> 01:52:39,-151
Come on.

1504
01:54:29,630 --> 01:54:31,029
What about the Tropicana?

1505
01:54:31,131 --> 01:54:33,497
What's wrong with the Opry?

1506
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,261
He was banned after
he smashed up the footlights.

1507
01:54:35,369 --> 01:54:38,167
Well, if he smashes
lights at Folsom...

1508
01:54:38,272 --> 01:54:40,069
they're going
to keep him there.

1509
01:54:40,174 --> 01:54:41,300
Look, Frank.

1510
01:54:41,408 --> 01:54:44,-158
While Johnny was
out recuperating...

1511
01:54:44,-56 --> 01:54:45,343
the world changed.

1512
01:54:45,446 --> 01:54:47,-155
Dylan's gone electric.

1513
01:54:47,-53 --> 01:54:49,074
The Byrds
are electric.

1514
01:54:49,183 --> 01:54:50,081
The Beatles
are electric.

1515
01:54:50,184 --> 01:54:51,151
Hell, everybody's
electric.

1516
01:54:51,251 --> 01:55:-7,048
He needs a fresh sound...

1517
01:55:-7,153 --> 01:55:-5,383
and all he wants to do is
cut a live album

1518
01:55:-5,489 --> 01:55:-3,719
with the same old pickers

1519
01:55:-2,-175 --> 01:55:-1,554
at a maximum-security
penitentiary!

1520
01:55:-1,660 --> 01:55:01,025
You can talk to me,
you know.

1521
01:55:01,128 --> 01:55:02,595
I'm standing
right here.

1522
01:55:02,696 --> 01:55:03,754
And what's with
the black?

1523
01:55:04,-136 --> 01:55:05,-112
It's depressing.

1524
01:55:05,-02 --> 01:55:07,330
Looks like
you're going to a funeral.

1525
01:55:08,635 --> 01:55:10,-103
Maybe I am.

1526
01:55:12,106 --> 01:55:14,370
Your fans are
church folk, Johnny.

1527
01:55:14,475 --> 01:55:16,238
Christians.

1528
01:55:16,343 --> 01:55:17,674
They don't want
to hear you singing

1529
01:55:18,-222 --> 01:55:20,-129
to a bunch of murderers
and rapists...

1530
01:55:20,-20 --> 01:55:21,277
trying to cheer
them up.

1531
01:55:25,-115 --> 01:55:27,080
Well, they're
not Christians, then.

1532
01:55:28,288 --> 01:55:30,085
I'm fine with you
doing a live record.

1533
01:55:30,190 --> 01:55:32,283
Just not at a prison.

1534
01:55:32,392 --> 01:55:34,155
That's my compromise.

1535
01:55:40,167 --> 01:55:42,397
January 13...

1536
01:55:42,503 --> 01:55:44,368
I'll be at Folsom Prison

1537
01:55:44,471 --> 01:55:47,065
with June and the boys.

1538
01:55:47,174 --> 01:55:49,472
You listen to the tapes.

1539
01:55:49,576 --> 01:55:51,544
You don't like 'em...

1540
01:55:51,645 --> 01:56:-7,704
you can toss 'em.

1541
01:56:02,-11 --> 01:56:04,150
Pardon me, Mr. Cash?

1542
01:56:04,258 --> 01:56:07,-12
M-Mr. Cash?

1543
01:56:07,094 --> 01:56:09,619
Mr. Cash?

1544
01:56:11,265 --> 01:56:14,-05
Might I suggest you refrain
from playing any more tunes

1545
01:56:14,101 --> 01:56:17,366
that remind them- the, uh,
the-the inmates, that is-

1546
01:56:17,471 --> 01:56:20,634
well, that they're in prison?

1547
01:56:22,709 --> 01:56:25,007
You think they forgot?

1548
01:56:25,112 --> 01:56:28,-21
Perhaps you and your wife
could do another spiritual.

1549
01:56:29,049 --> 01:56:31,017
That's not my wife, Warden.

1550
01:56:33,220 --> 01:56:36,212
Keep asking her, and
she keeps saying no.

1551
01:56:42,596 --> 01:56:44,757
You ever drink this water,
Warden?

1552
01:56:45,-135 --> 01:56:47,-201
No.

1553
01:56:47,-100 --> 01:56:49,-109
I'm a Coca-Cola man.

1554
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:09,680
All right!

1555
01:57:21,735 --> 01:57:24,397
I want to remind you,
we're recording live here today...

1556
01:57:24,504 --> 01:57:27,-28
so you can't say "hell" or
"shit" or anything like that.

1557
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:32,-29
I got to tell you,
I can't tell you

1558
01:57:32,079 --> 01:57:34,-158
how many shows we done...

1559
01:57:34,-53 --> 01:57:36,313
but this is the best audience
we ever had.

1560
01:57:36,416 --> 01:57:38,350
I want to thank you for that.

1561
01:57:42,155 --> 01:57:43,486
You know...

1562
01:57:43,590 --> 01:57:46,115
standing back there in your
shop, catching my breath...

1563
01:57:46,226 --> 01:57:48,160
I come to admire
you even more.

1564
01:57:48,262 --> 01:57:49,752
Yeah!

1565
01:57:50,-137 --> 01:58:-8,-203
You see, I never had
to do hard time like you...

1566
01:58:-8,-101 --> 01:58:-7,264
Yeah!

1567
01:58:-7,367 --> 01:58:-5,392
...although I have on occasion...

1568
01:58:-5,502 --> 01:58:-3,-201
gotten myself busted.

1569
01:58:-1,-94 --> 01:58:02,-159
Once in El Paso,
I had this bag of... Oh...

1570
01:58:02,-58 --> 01:58:03,000
you heard about that?

1571
01:58:03,110 --> 01:58:04,236
You been in El Paso, too?

1572
01:58:04,344 --> 01:58:05,606
Well, anyways...

1573
01:58:05,712 --> 01:58:07,612
I felt tough, you know?

1574
01:58:07,714 --> 01:58:10,706
Like I'd seen a thing or two,
you know?

1575
01:58:13,-147 --> 01:58:15,-20
Well, that was
till a moment ago...

1576
01:58:15,088 --> 01:58:18,023
'cause I got to tell you,
my hat's off to you now.

1577
01:58:18,125 --> 01:58:22,357
'Cause I ain't never had
to drink this yellow water

1578
01:58:22,462 --> 01:58:23,690
you got here at Folsom.

1579
01:58:24,-203 --> 01:58:25,389
- All right.

1580
01:58:34,-160 --> 01:58:37,-134
This song's for your warden.

1581
01:59:22,456 --> 01:59:23,616
Boom!

1582
02:00:14,708 --> 02:00:16,073
In the back.

1583
02:00:35,162 --> 02:00:38,359
Hey, June.

1584
02:00:40,467 --> 02:00:42,-43
June.

1585
02:00:45,272 --> 02:00:47,365
What's wrong, John?

1586
02:00:47,474 --> 02:00:49,601
Oh...

1587
02:00:49,709 --> 02:01:-8,576
bad dreams, memories.

1588
02:01:-7,713 --> 02:01:-4,079
Well, you need
to get some rest, sweetie.

1589
02:01:-3,651 --> 02:01:-1,551
You did good tonight.

1590
02:01:-1,653 --> 02:01:01,211
Well, we got another show

1591
02:01:01,321 --> 02:01:02,379
tomorrow.

1592
02:01:02,489 --> 02:01:03,751
Yeah.

1593
02:01:04,-143 --> 02:01:06,724
Hey, listen.

1594
02:01:07,-173 --> 02:01:09,-114
The thing is...

1595
02:01:09,-05 --> 02:01:11,555
I think it's time
now, you know?

1596
02:01:11,665 --> 02:01:13,064
I think it's
about time.

1597
02:01:13,166 --> 02:01:14,633
Time for what?

1598
02:01:14,734 --> 02:01:16,634
For you and me

1599
02:01:16,736 --> 02:01:18,670
to get married.

1600
02:01:21,374 --> 02:01:24,036
Go to sleep, John.

1601
02:01:24,144 --> 02:01:26,078
I don't want to sleep.

1602
02:01:26,179 --> 02:01:28,-194
I want to marry you...

1603
02:01:28,-86 --> 02:01:30,246
and I'm telling you,
it's the time.

1604
02:01:30,350 --> 02:01:34,-55
Well, I am telling you,
with 100% certainty...

1605
02:01:34,054 --> 02:01:36,-81
that it is not the time.

1606
02:01:36,022 --> 02:01:37,683
It's not about time.

1607
02:01:38,-209 --> 02:01:39,053
It's not the right time.

1608
02:01:39,159 --> 02:01:41,286
It's not even quarter
to the right time.

1609
02:01:43,363 --> 02:01:45,331
June.

1610
02:01:47,-200 --> 02:01:48,700
How do you know? I mean...

1611
02:01:49,-198 --> 02:01:50,429
You haven't been clean
even six months.

1612
02:01:50,537 --> 02:02:-8,004
Come on.

1613
02:02:-8,105 --> 02:02:-6,039
Except for a honeymoon,
you have not even thought

1614
02:02:-6,141 --> 02:02:-5,631
about what you're asking me.

1615
02:02:-5,742 --> 02:02:-2,506
Yes, I have.

1616
02:02:-2,612 --> 02:02:01,274
I have. That's all
I've thought about.

1617
02:02:01,381 --> 02:02:03,440
Well, how's it going to work,
John?

1618
02:02:03,550 --> 02:02:05,450
Where we going to live?

1619
02:02:05,552 --> 02:02:07,019
What about my girls?

1620
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:09,088
- What about your girls?
- Well...

1621
02:02:09,189 --> 02:02:11,089
What about
your parents, John?

1622
02:02:11,191 --> 02:02:14,-215
Your daddy won't
even look at me.

1623
02:02:14,-106 --> 02:02:16,158
June, that stuff will just
work itself out.

1624
02:02:16,263 --> 02:02:17,355
No, it does not work itself out.

1625
02:02:17,464 --> 02:02:18,624
People work it out for you...

1626
02:02:18,732 --> 02:02:20,199
and you think
it works itself out.

1627
02:02:22,235 --> 02:02:24,203
You're scared.

1628
02:02:24,304 --> 02:02:25,430
What?

1629
02:02:25,539 --> 02:02:29,305
You're scared of being in love.

1630
02:02:29,409 --> 02:02:31,172
You're scared of losing control.

1631
02:02:31,278 --> 02:02:33,-130
And you know what, June Carter?

1632
02:02:33,-21 --> 02:02:36,278
I think you're scared of living
in my big fat shadow.

1633
02:02:36,383 --> 02:02:38,214
- That's your problem.
- Oh, really?

1634
02:02:38,318 --> 02:02:40,-124
- Yeah. Yeah, it is.
- Is that my problem?

1635
02:02:40,-123 --> 02:02:42,477
My problem is it's 2:00 a.m.

1636
02:02:42,522 --> 02:02:44,-45
My problem is I'm asleep.

1637
02:02:44,057 --> 02:02:46,025
I'm on a tour bus
with eight stinking men.

1638
02:02:46,126 --> 02:02:48,185
Rule number one- don't propose
to a girl on a bus.

1639
02:02:48,295 --> 02:02:49,523
You got that?

1640
02:02:49,629 --> 02:02:51,028
Rule number two-
don't tell her

1641
02:02:51,131 --> 02:03:-7,258
it's because
you had a bad dream.

1642
02:03:-6,668 --> 02:03:-4,-172
June?

1643
02:03:-4,-64 --> 02:03:-3,233
What?

1644
02:03:-3,337 --> 02:03:-1,-173
Marry me.

1645
02:03:04,477 --> 02:03:06,445
Okay.

1646
02:03:08,381 --> 02:03:09,712
Well, that's...

1647
02:03:10,-184 --> 02:03:12,-91
that's the last time I'm asking.

1648
02:03:12,018 --> 02:03:13,144
Well, good.

1649
02:03:13,253 --> 02:03:15,221
I hate reruns.

1650
02:03:29,302 --> 02:03:31,-37
Hey, June?

1651
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:36,-133
June?

1652
02:03:36,-24 --> 02:03:37,102
What's that, dear?

1653
02:03:37,210 --> 02:03:38,302
June?

1654
02:03:38,411 --> 02:03:40,538
I said...

1655
02:03:42,015 --> 02:03:43,209
What's that, dear?

1656
02:03:44,718 --> 02:03:47,-155
What, you're not talking to me?

1657
02:03:47,-47 --> 02:03:49,-113
You are not allowed
to speak to me tonight.

1658
02:03:49,-11 --> 02:03:50,513
After that stunt you
pulled on the bus...

1659
02:03:50,624 --> 02:04:-8,717
the only place you're allowed
to speak to me is on stage.

1660
02:04:-7,-174 --> 02:04:-5,158
- Do you understand?
- What did I do?

1661
02:04:-5,262 --> 02:04:-3,-43
I don't know.
Why don't you ask your big fat shadow?

1662
02:04:-3,063 --> 02:04:-2,121
Come on, baby.

1663
02:04:-2,231 --> 02:04:-1,323
Come on, baby.

1664
02:04:-1,432 --> 02:04:01,559
Baby, baby, baby,
baby, baby.

1665
02:05:-4,056 --> 02:05:-2,115
All right, thank you.

1666
02:05:00,694 --> 02:05:03,527
I don't know if y'all know
who wrote that song...

1667
02:05:03,630 --> 02:05:06,-175
but it's this long-legged gal
standing right here...

1668
02:05:06,-68 --> 02:05:08,-203
Miss June Carter.

1669
02:05:09,135 --> 02:05:11,194
Thanks, ya'll.
Thank you very much.

1670
02:05:11,304 --> 02:05:14,364
So, uh, June, you going
to stand over there all night...

1671
02:05:14,474 --> 02:05:16,704
or you want to come over here
and sing with me?

1672
02:05:17,-190 --> 02:05:18,710
I'll sing with you,
Mr. Cash.

1673
02:05:19,-188 --> 02:05:20,074
You sure
that's what you want?

1674
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:21,306
Yeah.

1675
02:05:21,414 --> 02:05:22,676
All right. Okay.

1676
02:05:27,487 --> 02:05:30,-215
Well, folks, what do you say?

1677
02:05:31,157 --> 02:05:32,590
You want to hear, uh, "Jackson"?

1678
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:35,426
All right.

1679
02:05:38,565 --> 02:05:40,533
Thought you was gonna
wax poetic a little bit longer.

1680
02:05:40,633 --> 02:05:43,-206
No, I'm done with that, June.

1681
02:05:43,-98 --> 02:05:44,699
Oh, okay, good.

1682
02:07:-6,140 --> 02:07:-5,607
Sorry for
the interruption, folks...

1683
02:07:-5,708 --> 02:07:00,-94
but, uh, I got to ask
June here a question

1684
02:07:00,013 --> 02:07:03,-120
before we finish this song.

1685
02:07:03,-18 --> 02:07:05,-187
What's that, John?

1686
02:07:07,-80 --> 02:07:10,321
Will you marry me?

1687
02:07:12,425 --> 02:07:14,620
Why don't we just
sing the song, John?

1688
02:07:14,727 --> 02:07:16,661
No, darling.

1689
02:07:18,765 --> 02:07:20,630
Come on, finish the song.

1690
02:07:20,733 --> 02:07:22,724
People want to hear us sing.

1691
02:07:25,-162 --> 02:07:26,669
Sorry folks, but, uh...

1692
02:07:27,-227 --> 02:07:28,638
I just can't do
this song anymore...

1693
02:07:28,741 --> 02:07:31,335
unless she's
gonna marry me.

1694
02:07:31,444 --> 02:07:34,538
It'd just be like
we're lying.

1695
02:07:34,647 --> 02:07:36,274
You got these people
all revved up, John.

1696
02:07:36,382 --> 02:07:40,-160
- Now come on, let's sing "Jackson" for 'em.
- You got me all revved up.

1697
02:07:40,-47 --> 02:07:41,386
I've asked you 40 different ways

1698
02:07:41,488 --> 02:07:43,581
and it's time you come
up with a fresh answer.

1699
02:07:45,658 --> 02:07:48,-215
Please, sing.

1700
02:07:48,-106 --> 02:07:51,352
I'm asking you to marry me.

1701
02:07:51,464 --> 02:08:-7,489
I love you, June.

1702
02:08:-3,537 --> 02:08:00,301
Now I know I said
and done a lot of things...

1703
02:08:00,406 --> 02:08:05,173
that I hurt you, but I promise
I'll never do that again.

1704
02:08:05,278 --> 02:08:07,143
I only want to take care of you.

1705
02:08:07,247 --> 02:08:10,341
I will not leave you
like that Dutch boy

1706
02:08:10,450 --> 02:08:13,283
with your finger in the dam.

1707
02:08:15,388 --> 02:08:18,221
You're my best friend.

1708
02:08:18,324 --> 02:08:22,658
Marry me.

1709
02:08:27,767 --> 02:08:30,361
All right.

1710
02:08:30,470 --> 02:08:33,735
Yeah?

1711
02:09:-7,459 --> 02:09:-4,519
In case none of y'all
heard, she said "yes"!

1712
02:09:02,335 --> 02:09:05,304
She's finally said "yes".

1713
02:09:40,106 --> 02:09:42,301
Grandpa, here,
let's talk on this.

1714
02:09:42,408 --> 02:09:44,205
What do you want me
to do with it?

1715
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:46,210
Well, you... you
listen and you talk.

1716
02:09:46,312 --> 02:09:47,574
It's a tin can telephone.

1717
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:50,171
And the sound goes
up the string.

1718
02:10:-8,118 --> 02:10:-5,747
Hello, grandgirls.
Hello, grandgirls.

1719
02:10:-4,-145 --> 02:10:-4,753
Can you hear us?

1720
02:10:-3,-144 --> 02:10:-1,256
Hello, Roseanne.

1721
02:10:-1,359 --> 02:10:00,656
Hello, Carlene.

1722
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:02,318
You got to pull
it tight, Daddy.

1723
02:10:02,428 --> 02:10:03,360
Come on, Grandpa.
Talk.

1724
02:10:03,463 --> 02:10:04,760
Speak, Grandpa.

1725
02:10:05,-136 --> 02:10:06,-169
- Tell us a story.
- Speak.

1726
02:10:06,-68 --> 02:10:07,-44
- Grandpa!
- Tell us a story.

1727
02:10:07,066 --> 02:10:08,397
Here, you take it,
talk to them.

1728
02:10:08,501 --> 02:10:10,093
No, they want to talk
to their grandpa.

1729
02:10:10,203 --> 02:10:12,535
I don't got no stories.
You got all the stories, Shooter.

1730
02:10:15,642 --> 02:10:17,303
Why don't you tell
them about the flood?

1731
02:10:17,410 --> 02:10:20,004
Tell them about how you made
a boat out of the front door

1732
02:10:20,113 --> 02:10:21,478
and got us all
out of there.

1733
02:10:21,581 --> 02:10:23,276
They'll like that.

1734
02:10:23,383 --> 02:10:24,281
Tell us!

1735
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:25,316
Come on, tell 'em.

1736
02:10:25,418 --> 02:10:27,682
You got to pull
the string tight.

1737
02:10:28,-213 --> 02:10:31,348
It was 1937...

1738
02:10:31,457 --> 02:10:33,288
There was a flood.
