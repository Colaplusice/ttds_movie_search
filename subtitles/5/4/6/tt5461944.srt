1
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,539
Taxi!

2
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:45,374
Taxi!

3
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,173
Okay, okay.

4
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,267
Ohh. Ohyo.

5
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,001
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

6
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,066
Bye.

7
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,943
Bye, Bubu.

8
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,613
Baba, goodbye. Bye, bye!

9
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,085
More hot water.
Make it 48 degrees, exactly 48.

10
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,256
- What is this?
- What?

11
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:05,050
A blue jumpsuit. It's a boy.
Blue, blue!

12
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,970
Um, but Sanjay said it's a girl.

13
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,555
The baby in 440, boy or girl?

14
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,849
Zahra Kashani, did she have
a boy or girl?

15
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,892
- Boy.
- Girl.

16
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,228
Put one of each.

17
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,578
Dilip? Dilip?
Where am I tonight?

18
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,955
Shamiana. Shamiana Restaurant.

19
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,250
Yeah, okay. Thank you very much.
I'll call. Bye.

20
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,961
Prahba? We have another
VIP guest on the way.

21
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,046
Mrs Kashani's daughter's
arriving shortly.

22
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,257
<i>Zahra Kashani.</i>

23
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,092
<i>She's just had a child
with an American.</i>

24
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,052
- He's just sleepy.
<i>- David Duncan.</i>

25
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,388
- Hey, how far to the hotel?
<i>- He's an architect.</i>

26
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,599
- About two blocks, sir.
- Perfect, thank you.

27
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,309
I think it's like 45 minutes?

28
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:56,602
<i>Their suite is ready</i>

29
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,437
<i>so head to the main lobby
and greet them.</i>

30
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,939
<i>They should be arriving
any minute now.</i>

31
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:06,653
Namaste.

32
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,363
<i>Congratulate them
on the baby</i>

33
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,199
<i>but do not mention the wedding.</i>

34
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,034
<i>They're not married?</i>

35
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,495
<i>They are, but Zahra was
already pregnant</i>

36
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,872
<i>so the mother insisted
on a private ceremony.</i>

37
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,373
<i>No publicity.</i>

38
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,167
Oh, wow!

39
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,298
- Hello.
- Namaste.

40
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,465
- How are you, Prahba?
- Splendid to have you back.

41
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,676
- Oh, thank you.
- Namaste.

42
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,678
And this is Sally,
our nanny.

43
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,180
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

44
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,848
Namaste.

45
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,851
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

46
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,770
- And welcome. Namaste.
- Namaste.

47
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,396
- Thank you.
- This is cool.

48
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:45,442
- We hope you have a good stay.
- Thank you. Thanks, Prahba.

49
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,945
And so, please,
if you'd follow me.

50
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,241
Everything that you ordered
has been placed

51
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,618
but if you need anything else,
please feel free to ask.

52
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:55,827
<i>Prahba?</i>

53
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,496
Nisha's taking them up now, sir.

54
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:59,373
<i>Have you booked
their dinner reservations?</i>

55
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,958
Yes, sir. 9pm at the Shamiana.

56
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,502
<i>Just book a table for
them in all our restaurants.</i>

57
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,509
<i>If she changes her mind
and we don't have room,</i>

58
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,047
<i>her mother is going to kill me.</i>

59
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,549
<i>Doing it now, sir.</i>

60
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,717
This way.

61
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,970
Welcome back to the Taj!

62
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,263
Wow!

63
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,473
I've drawn a bath just
to your liking, 48 degrees.

64
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,850
Thank you, Jomon,
that's too kind.

65
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,270
- Oh, look at that!
- Where's my little boy?

66
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,939
- Want to go see Mum?
- Hello, my gorgeous boy. Yes!

67
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,404
- My God, how cute is this?
- Champagne!

68
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,197
I still think he's a bit warm.

69
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:35,409
- Oh, you think so?
- Yeah.

70
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,411
- Hey, baby, where's the...
- Corner cupboard.

71
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,579
Corner cupboard.

72
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,582
Shall I call a doctor,
just to be on the safe side?

73
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,042
Yeah. Just to be
on the safe side.

74
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,128
And your 9pm reservation
at the Shamiana?

75
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:47,796
I don't know. What do you think?

76
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,381
You want to just get
room service?

77
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,133
Oh, no, no, you two should go.

78
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,140
You could always nip back up
when he gets here.

79
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,179
I'll keep your reservation and
you come at your convenience

80
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,056
or not, as you wish.

81
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,725
Thank you, Jomon.

82
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,352
Let's go.

83
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,146
You're my sweets.

84
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,187
Come on. I'm going to go change.
Let's go to dinner.

85
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,110
Naughty Daddy, naughty.

86
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,821
There's a whole 'nother room
back here.

87
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,406
What's going on?

88
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:58,969
Hands.

89
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,896
Very good.

90
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,358
Turn around.

91
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,945
Okay, good. Very good.

92
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,531
Show me your socks.

93
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,411
Mm. Okay, relax.

94
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,205
You need a neat cut,
not this stretching down.

95
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,791
Good. Nice. Relax.

96
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,835
Good.

97
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,680
Is this a joke?

98
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,183
Forgive me, sir,
I... I lost my shoes.

99
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,602
They must have fallen
from my bag.

100
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,855
Go home, Arjun.

101
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,607
Everyone else, let's move.

102
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:56,318
- Sir, sir, please.
- Please what?

103
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,986
You look like a beggar.

104
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,238
Sir, please, I'll find some
shoes. I need this shift.

105
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,365
You need to leave.

106
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,409
Sir. Sir, please.

107
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:08,038
My wife's going to give birth
any day now.

108
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,873
Please.

109
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:15,337
There's an extra pair of shoes
in my room.

110
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,130
Under the desk.

111
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,633
- Thank you, sir.
- Hurry up!

112
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,305
<i>..metropolis built

113

<i>on the edge of the Arabian Sea.</i>

114

<i>Security cameras captured

124

<i>The biggest worry at
this point in time</i>

125
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,868
<i>is that there is a fear
amongst the cops</i>

126
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:13,121
<i>who are still trying to figure
out the source of the firing</i>

<i>This is the biggest fear</i>

130
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,631
<i>right now in the minds
of the police because</i>

131
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,342
<i>there was a point where
there... there came a car...</i>

132
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:34,267
<i>Well, there you saw,
you saw a police van,</i>

133
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:38,355
<i>a police Toyota Qualis
being driven...</i>

134

<i>..and indiscriminate fire.</i>

135
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,710
So, these are for the Sindhi
wedding in the Ocean Room.

136
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,213
The kimchis are for the
trade delegation in Wasabi.

137
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,674
The MPs are already

138
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,926
Mm-hm.

139
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,177
More lemongrass, huh?

140
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,762
Arjun!

141
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,473
Stop limping.

142
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,850
Yeah, more lemongrass.

143
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,437
- What about the Russian?
- Booked into the Shamiana, sir.

144
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,398
He has party later,
he wants help.

145
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,400
Okay, everyone.

146
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,652
Everyone listen in, please,
come on. Leave that.

147
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:30,365
Come on, come here, come here.
Yes. Okay, come on, hurry up.

148
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:33,284
Yep.

149
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:36,913

- Sir.
<i>- He can be difficult.</i>

153
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,048
Mr Gordetsky,
so nice to see you again.

just smile, be polite...</i>

<i>..be courteous.</i>

156
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:57,767
Remember always,
here at the Taj, guest is God.

157
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,561
<i>Under no circumstances</i>

158

00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:09,529
<i>Never, ever serve him drink
in a glass, always a bottle.</i>

161
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,176
<i>And make sure that you open
the bottle</i>

162
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,408
<i>in front of him, directly.</i>

163
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:41,811
The tall one. She has
big nipples or small nipples?

164
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,941
Good. Okay, send them both.

165
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,194
Who speaks like that?

166
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,864
<i>After dinner,</i>

167
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:56,451
Mr Gordetsky's having
a private party in his suite.

168
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,244
He will need a waiter.

169
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,121
Of course there will be
large tips.

170
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,415
- Sir? Olga speaks Russian.
- No.

171
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,292
Never a female staff.

172
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,252
We can't have a repeat
of last time.

173
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,837
Sir, I would be honoured
to serve.

174
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,506
No, thank you, Arjun.

175
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,299
Sir, please, I'll ensure that...

176
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,385
You will ensure that you arrive
in the proper footwear.

177
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,767
Sanjay, you will serve
at the Russian's party tonight.

178
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:24,312
Go to Elia's and get two bottles
of Vernier Dejeune.

179
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,815
- Wanjidon. Thank you, sir.
- Hold on. What did you say?

180
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,359
Wanjidon? What is Wanjidon?

181
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,694
It's Vernier Dejeune.

182
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:32,862
Verdijan?

183
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,489
It is Vernier Dejeune.

184
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,658
- With 'V'.
- 'V'. Verrrr...

185
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,202
- With 'V'. Vernier Dejeune.
- 'V'...

186
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,579
Don't repeat 'V'.
Just say Vernier Dejeune!

187
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,706
- 'V'...
- Not 'V', Vernier Dejeune!

188
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,209
Wanjidon!

189
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,045
Vernier Dejeune.
It's a cognac.

190
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,212
Go!

191
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,048
Wanjidon. Wanjidon.
Thank you, sir.

192
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,299
Wanjidon.

193
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,163
You won't believe
the kind of women

194
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,581
he's got coming over tonight.

195
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,040
The Russian guy, yeah.

196
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,043
Ha. I heard they're knockouts.

197
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,962
Ten out of ten, man!

198
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:35,175
Yeah. Coming in an hour. Yeah.

199
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,218
Oi!

200
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,857
What are you looking at?

201
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,901
Go.

202
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,861
Go!

203
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:00,033
Check these
dudes out. He's going off, look!

204
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,534
They are going nuts!

205
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,162
Look at him, look at
the little angry butler!

206
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,831
- Look at him! Check him out!
- Babe, babe, hi. Eddie!

207
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,708
I'm putting money
on the little butler man.

208
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,586
- Taj.
- Taj. Yes, let's go.

209
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,004
- Alright.
- Let's go.

210
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,340
We're going to the Taj.

211
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,383
We're going to the Taj.

212
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,261
Um, hang on. Let's go...
Ah, excuse me, sir.

213
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,890
- Namaste, mate.
- Namaste.

214
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,184
Um, I think we've got
a little problem here

215
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:29,479
because we didn't order
this pork thing.

216
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,481
Yes.

217
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,775
No. No, no, no, no.

218
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,818
I don't think so
because if you just look here,

219
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,528
we didn't actually...

220
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,702
Fuck. Bree, get down!

221
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,108
This way.

222
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,652
Come on! Come on,
come on, go! Go!

223
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,029
Run!

224
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,614
Go, babe. Go!

225
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,744
Come on, go. Come on! Come on!

226
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,872
- Are you hurt?
- I don't know. Don't think so.

227
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:26,346
If I may, ahh, 2003 was
a very good year for Bordeaux

228
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,265
due to the exceptional heat wave
that year.

229
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:32,894
Ah, the Château Latour there,
amazing depth,

230
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:35,438
powerful yet silky dark fruit.

231
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,732
A seamless finish,
it's a very good wine.

232
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:39,984
- That sounds nice.
- Yeah.

233
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,571
Um...

234
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:47,158
You know, why don't you just
bring me a JD and Diet Coke?

235
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,285
- Really?
- Yeah.

236
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:50,912
And you know what?

237
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,914
Bring us a cheeseburger,
for old times' sake.

238
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,582
Chicken or fish, sir?

239
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,334
No, just a regular burger. Beef.

240
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:59,253
Oh. They don't have beef here.

241
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,255
Yeah, they got everything here.

242
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,132
Honey, cows are sacred in India.

243
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,010
I am so sorry,
I completely spaced.

244
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,470
It's OK.

245
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,847
OK, so what do you recommend?
What's...

246
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,808
The lamb kofta is
very popular...

247
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:12,974
Hey, Sally.

248
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,852
Hey, Zahra.

249
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,687
No, I've just checked in
with reception.

250
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,689
They said the doctor's
still on their way.

251
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,235
No, no, he's more than fine.

252
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,530
Yeah, he had a big feed
and I just put him down.

253
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,659
Sure, I'll call you then.

254
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,661
But, really, we're all good.

255
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,539
OK.

256
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:37,083
Enjoy.

257
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,821
- Good evening, Taj Palace Hotel.
- Hi, there.

258
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:09,240
Just checking about the doctor.

259
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:10,992
OK, so next trip,
I have an idea,

260
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,618
let's go, just the two of us.

261
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,203
Yeah, I'd like that.

262
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,456
Bree! Go!

263
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:18,958
Bree, run!

264
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,170
Run! Go! Run!

265
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,055
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait!
Wait!

266
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:42,356
Door, man,
just fucking open the door!

267
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,944
Security.
Can we get security now?

268
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,322
Dilip, look.

269
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:53,659
We've got a reservation, mate.

270
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,746
Let them in!
It's OK, let them all in.

271
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,998
Bree, Bree.
Thank you, thank you.

272
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,550
Bree, come on.
Excuse me.

273
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,427
- Let's go somewhere else.
- Lani, is it?

274
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:14,907
Sir, I have no record
of your booking.

275
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,493
- Please, if we could just...
- Sir...

276
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,079
Listen, can we just please
call our family?

277
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,186
Lights. Switch off the lights.

278
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:47,315
Down. Down. Everyone down! Down.

279
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:49,775
Please. Under the tables. Down.

280
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,238
Bree!

281
00:26:58,618 --> 00:26:59,910
No, no, no.

282
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,708
Under the tables. Down.
Down, down, please.

283
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,044
Please, down, down, sir.

284
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,420
- Who are they?
- Sir, down!

285
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,227
- They have machine guns.
- You must hide!

286
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,914
Go.

287
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,721
It's okay, it's okay.

288
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,728
Pick up, Sally.

289
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:15,421
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello?

290
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,757
Sir, this is the reception.

291
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,383
<i>What?</i>

292
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,177
- This is the reception.
<i>- Sorry?</i>

293
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,179
There's a security issue, here.

294
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,264
No, please don't leave
your room, sir.

295
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,475
I'll be in touch, sir.

296
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,059
Yes, yes.

297
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:47,536
Room service!

298
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:48,913
Laundry.

299
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,625
Laundry.

300
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,439
Hey, hey. Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

301
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,233
Sh, sh, sh.

302
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,318
You're okay. Come on, Cameron.

303
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,278
Sh, sh, sh, sh.

304
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,197
Coming.

305
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,116
David?

306
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,118
Sally, thank God!
Where are you?

307
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,746
Sh, sh, sh. Sorry, what?

308
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,581
- Where's Cameron?
- Where's Cameron?

309
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,667
The doctor's here now.

310
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:38,045
Just a second. Sorry, it keeps
breaking up, I can't hear you.

311
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:40,714
Don't answer the door!

312
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,925
<i>Sally!</i>

313
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:46,178
Oh, my God!

314
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:49,473
Zahra.

315
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,393
Zahra, this woman just...

316
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:56,605
Sally, what's happening?

317
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:10,286
Sh, sh, sh, sh.

318
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,537
Sh, sh, sh.

319
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:33,911
- Houssam.
- Huh?

320
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,835
Come out!

321
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,214
- Come out!
- Imran.

322
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:47,002
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

323
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:49,797
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

324
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,472
Shh.

325
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,935
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

326
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,314
What is happening?
Where's Cameron?

327
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,483
There were men with guns,
just boys.

328
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,443
They came in but we hid.
Shhhh.

329
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,113
<i>- They came in our room?
- Oh, my God, David.</i>

330
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:18,492
And they shot someone, David.
They just came in and they...

331
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,744
Okay, okay.
You stay right where you are.

332
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:23,997
- I'm coming there right now.
- Hey!

333
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:27,042
Shut your fucking mouth!
You'll get us all killed.

334
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:34,174
Look at me. I need you
to stay right here.

335
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,635
I need you to be strong, okay?

336
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:39,471
I love you so much.

337
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,684
We need the police right now.
Right now.

338
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,853
We've called you five times.
Please send someone.

339
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,356
- Sir, please, please.
- My kid's upstairs.

340
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:52,276
Sir, please.
Please, sir. Please, sir.

341
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:55,612
- Do you have a family?
- Yes, sir.

342
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,614
And I hope to stay alive
and see them.

343
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,992
- I'm going out that door.
- No, no, sir. You cannot...

344
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,618
- I need to piss.
- You can't.

345
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:02,828
I need to piss!

346
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,460
- I need to pee!
- Sir.

347
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,462
- Use this, please.
- Huh? You piss in this!

348
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,131
- I'm not an animal!
- Madam, please.

349
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:15,938
- Get out of the way!
- No, madam. Please.

350
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,882
Madam, this way, hurry.

351
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:32,722
Sally!

352
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,272
Oh, God, David.

353
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:42,315
Thank God you're here.
Oh, my God.

354
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,871
Where's Cameron? Where is he?

355
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,457
David.

356
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,252
Hey. Hey.

357
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:04,629
It's okay.

358
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,381
Hi.

359
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,971
It's okay.

360
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:18,727
Thank you. Thank you.

361
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,772
Thank you. Thank you.

362
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,774
Who are these people?

363
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:27,903
What do they want with us?

364
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,654
Hey, sh, sh, sh.

365
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,907
Will you message Zahra for me?

366
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,492
Can you tell her
we made it okay?

367
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,787
Yeah.

368
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:40,665
It's okay.

369
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:44,002
It's okay, it's okay. Shhhh.

370
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,630
It's going to be okay.

371

392
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:47,917
Help!

393
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:57,135
My girlfriend, my girlfriend,
she's still in there. Bree!

394
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:00,764
Bree! Bree!

395
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,682
Bree!

396
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:12,400
Okay, okay. CCTV room.

397
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:31,503
They're still shooting
downstairs

398
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,421
and in the east wing.

399
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,840
The safest would be go up
to the Chambers Lounge.

400
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:39,260
Yes. Sixth floor.

401
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,471
Okay, Arjun.

402
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:43,807
Okay. Call me
if you hear anything.

403
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:51,106
Service stairs are all clear.

404
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:55,527
But our guests are trapped
all through the hotel.

405
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,322
I think we should try and gather
whoever we can

406
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:02,951
and take them
to the Chambers Lounge

407
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:04,703
and wait for the police
to arrive.

408
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,788
Sir, Olga made it
through the back exit.

409
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:08,540
We can do the same.

410
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:10,917
Yes, but our guests can't.

411
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:12,627
Not all of them.

412
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:20,510
- Sir, I have four kids at home.
- I know, Dilip.

413
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,972
Nobody's forcing you to stay.

414
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:29,477
So whoever wants to try
and make it out...

415
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:33,523
..this is your time.

416
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:36,901
I'm sorry, sir.

417
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,070
Don't apologise.

418
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,322
Go.

419
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:57,213
Many of you have wives...

420
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:02,177
..parents,
families at home.

421
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,596
There is no shame in leaving.

422
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:08,892
I've been here 35 years.
This is my home.

423
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,021
- I'm staying too.
- I'm staying too.

424
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:15,064
I'm with you, sir.

425
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:16,983
Guest is God, sir.

426
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:24,282
Follow me.

427
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:35,084
Here. Wrap that
around your head

428
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,504
so they know
you are one of them.

429
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,839
I'm not one of them.

430
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:45,011
Sir, madam,
I just spoke to my boss.

431
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:47,258
He says we should come upstairs
to the Chambers Club.

432
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:50,600
- We'll be safer there.
- Why? You know something?

433
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,811
How many there are,
where they are?

434
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,354
I'm not sure, sir,

435
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:56,582
but the Chambers is the most
secure place in the hotel.

436
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:58,483
I know what
the fucking Chambers is.

437
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,527
Is the passage clear?

438
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:03,822
Yes, sir. We'll go
via the service stairs.

439
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,615
We'll leave
in a couple of minutes, okay?

440
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:23,591

00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:47,920
Mr Vasili, how are you?

481
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:50,715
Come, come this way.

482
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:55,344
Please, please, this way.
Take a seat.

483
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:58,014
You have water?

484
00:50:58,181 --> 00:50:59,640
- Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
- Jomon!

485
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:02,143
I'm so sorry.
Everything will be fine now.

486
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:05,021
You're totally safe.
Sit anywhere you like, okay?

487
00:51:05,188 --> 00:51:06,481
No problem.

488
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,024
Please, please.

489
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:11,903
- Can I help you, sir?
- I'd like a cognac.

490
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,780
- Vernier Dejeune.
- Of course, sir.

491
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:16,866
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

492
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,786
Take a seat, sir.

493
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,802
Ladies and gentlemen,

494
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,678
may I have your attention,
please?

495
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,931
Can you come closer?
Arjun, can you just help them?

496
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:42,642
A little further. I don't want
to speak loudly, please.

497
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:45,311
Can you come closer, sir?
Sir, ma'am? Please?

498
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:47,188
Sir, can you come forward,
please?

499
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:48,648
Thank you.

500
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:57,115
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Hemant Oberoi,

501
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,117
head chef here at the Taj.

502
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,452
We are all terribly sorry

503
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,872
for everything you've
had to endure here tonight.

504
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:09,293
But please be rest assured
the worst is behind us now.

505
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:12,964
The Chambers is
an exclusive club,

506
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:15,842
very difficult to access.

507
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:18,177
As you can see, there are
no internal windows

508
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:20,805
and every entrance
has been secured.

509
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:25,685
We will be safe here until
police comes and fetches us.

510
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:27,979
- When will that be?
- What's taking so long?

511
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:32,316
Ma'am, they're outside right
now. It's just a matter of time.

512
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:37,822
Yes, what's important is that
we remain calm and quiet

513
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:41,159
because we want our position
to remain a secret.

514
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,205
REPORTER, TV:
<i>The situation inside the hotel</i>

515
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,832
<i>is becoming utterly desperate.</i>

516
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,667
<i>Footage just in of this man,</i>

517
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,502
<i>forced to flee on a rope...</i>

518
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,296
Come on. We should get going.

519
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:55,590
Going where?

520
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:56,757
Staff's moving everybody

521
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,684
up to the Chambers Lounge
on the sixth floor.

522
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,595
- They said it'll be safer.
- No way.

523
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,305
Sally, come on.

524
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:04,473
You can go.
I'm not going anywhere.

525
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:08,662
David, there are men with guns
killing people in the hallway.

526
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,730
There's no way
that I'm going out there.

527
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:14,567
I know. And Zahra's out there
and she's by herself.

528
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:16,861
They came in here and they
fucking shot her, David,

529
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:18,696
like a fucking rabbit

530
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,656
and if we move
and if the baby wakes

531
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:23,117
- they're going to shoot us too.
- Okay, okay.

532
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,580
I mean, the cops are already
outside.

533
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:29,707
Can't we just wait for them
to come and get us?

534
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:37,423
Yep. Okay.

535
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:27,598
Kanu!

536
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:29,976
Kanu!

537
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:32,436
Kanu!

538
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:44,240
<i>It's been a night and a morning</i>

539
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:46,450
<i>of gun battles in Mumbai.</i>

540
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:49,161
<i>Perhaps never before has a city
been attacked</i>

541
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:53,457
<i>in a coordinated yet random
and completely mindless manner.</i>

542
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,334
<i>There's been hours and hours</i>

543
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:58,212
<i>of indiscriminate terror
on the streets of Mumbai</i>

544
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:01,966
<i>and we still don't seem to be
at the end of it.</i>

545
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:04,510
<i>Let's get you the big headlines
from Mumbai.</i>

546
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:08,514
<i>At least 78 people are dead
and nearly 200 injured</i>

547
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:10,558
<i>in a series of attacks
in South Mumbai.</i>

548
00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:14,061
<i>Three five-star hotels,
a petrol pump in Colaba,</i>

549
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,439
<i>the CST Station,
the Cama Hospital,</i>

550
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,066
<i>all come under attack.</i>

551
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:22,278
<i>Mumbai's majestic Taj Hotel
is still burning</i>

552
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:27,033
<i>as gun battles continue between
security forces and terrorists.</i>

553
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,035
Would you like a drink?

554
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:31,996
How much longer, Mr Savanth?

555
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:34,081
You're the Chief of Police!
What's going on?

556
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,167
<i>The head of our terror
squad was gunned down</i>

557
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:38,127
<i>in his car tonight, Mr Oberoi,</i>

558
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:40,338
<i>and special forces
are yet to leave Delhi.</i>

559
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:43,341
Still in Delhi?
Then send somebody from here.

560
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,259
Use the police force,
for God's sake.

561
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:47,053
<i>We sent in a local squad
an hour ago</i>

562
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,888
<i>but we haven't heard a word
since.</i>

563
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:03,319
I'm sorry.

564
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:06,655
I just want to be home.

565
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:20,086
Who were you speaking with?

566
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,921
What?

567
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:23,547
Who were you talking to
on the phone?

568
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:25,716
None of your business.

569
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:29,720
She's one of them.

570
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:32,515
- What are you trying to say?
- You're talking that language.

571
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,868
- Are you calling me a terrorist?
- You were talking that language.

572
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:36,560
- Just say it!
- Why won't you answer?

573
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,437
Why won't you tell me
who was on the phone?

574
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:40,314
- She's with me.
- I need you to tell me!

575
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:42,483
- She's one of...
- Hey! Shut your mouth!

576
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:45,027
Shut up! Walk away.

577
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:47,988
- Your behaviour is disgraceful.
- Go fuck yourself. Walk away.

578
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,658
Madam, come. Come.
It's okay, sir. Come.

579
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:52,827
With everything going on,
that's what she tells me?

580
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,370
- You're okay?
- No, seriously.

581
00:56:54,537 --> 00:56:56,247
Don't worry,
she is total bitch.

582
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:58,332
- Come, come.
- Look at that face.

583
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:01,627
She's not been fucked
for ten years. Minimum.

584
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,631
- Hey.
- Thank you.

585
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:07,842
Fine.

586
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:10,928
It's a crazy situation
but we just have to wait.

587
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,013
We'll be fine.

588
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,652
Arjun. Arjun.

589
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:27,945
Sorry.

590
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,240
Yes, sir?

591
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:33,527
See the English woman
over there, at the food station?

592
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:37,580
Yes.

593
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:39,415
She's worried about your beard.

594
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:42,084
My beard?

595
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:44,086
Also, your turban.

596
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:46,464
Hang back in the kitchen
for a little bit, huh?

597
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,257
Good boy.

598
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:05,399
Madam, I'd... I'd like
to show you something.

599
00:58:07,026 --> 00:58:08,903
This is my family.

600
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:14,533
This is my... this is my child.

601
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:18,037
It's Seva.

602
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:23,667
That's my... my wife and her
quite... quite awful sister.

603
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:32,092
This is my... this is my pagri.

604
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:35,471
To us Sikhs it is...

605
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:37,264
It is sacred.

606
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:43,103
It's a... It's a symbol
of... honour.

607
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,939
And courage.

608
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,070
Since I was a small boy,

609
00:58:51,237 --> 00:58:54,532
I've... never gone outside
without it.

610
00:58:57,034 --> 00:59:00,371
To do so would bring shame
to my family.

611
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:07,294
But while we are in this hotel,
you are my guest

612
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,380
and I am your staff,

613
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:14,009
so if it would make you feel
comfortable, I will take it off.

614
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:16,053
Would you like that?

615
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,972
No.

616
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:19,723
No.

617
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:21,559
I'm just scared.

618
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,727
We all are.

619
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:27,773
But... to get through this

620
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:32,570
we must... we must
stick together, okay?

621
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,782
Yes. Indeed.

622
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:38,909
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

623
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:40,744
I will bring you some water,
okay?

624
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,288
Okay.

625
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:50,546
- Hello? Mrs Watson?
<i>- Yes, yes.</i>

626
00:59:50,713 --> 00:59:52,506
This is Lani
from the hotel reception.

627
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:54,091
<i>Yes.</i>

628
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:55,926
Ma'am, the rescue team is
on your floor.

629
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,803
<i>- They are?</i>
- Yes.

630
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:00,347
- They're on their way, ma'am.
<i>- Thank God.</i>

631
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,725
<i>Yes, yes, I can hear them.</i>

632
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:04,685
<i>Alex, Alex, let them in.</i>

633
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:19,677
What are you doing? Don't open
that door. What, you crazy?

634
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:21,929
- You're going to get us killed!
- Be quiet!

635
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:27,142
Mr Oberoi, sir,
it's Prahba.

636
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,395
- It could be a trap!
- I know what I'm doing, sir.

637
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:35,234
Oh, my God, Prahba.

638
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:37,820
It's not my blood. Come.

639
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:39,530
Sh! Sh!

640
01:01:39,697 --> 01:01:41,699
Arjun, attention!

641
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:43,617
It's okay, come, come,
please come.

642
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:50,999
Please.

643
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,168
Please, please.

644
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:54,670
Be quiet!

645
01:01:54,837 --> 01:01:57,631
It's okay. Madam.
It's okay, it's okay.

646
01:01:57,798 --> 01:02:00,300
It's okay.

647
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:03,512
Is there a doctor here, please,
a doctor or a nurse?

648
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:05,264
- I'm an ophthalmologist.
- Please come.

649
01:02:05,431 --> 01:02:07,471
I'm not sure if there's much
I can do but I can try.

650
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:10,728
I need to see the wound.

651
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:13,689
Sh!

652
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:16,150
Quiet! Be quiet!

653
01:02:19,695 --> 01:02:21,572
Okay, we need to tape
this hole shut

654
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:23,657
and we need to make
a sling for her arm.

655
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:26,910
- Elastoplast, Sellotape...
- First-aid box!

656
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,830
Come, hold this, hold tight.

657
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:40,257
It's not good. I think she's
bleeding into her chest cavity.

658
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:42,760
There's no way to save her
without getting her to hospital.

659
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,221
- I'll take her.
- Too risky.

660
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:49,266
If she stays, she'll die.

661
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:56,690
Sir, please let me take her.

662
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:59,651
We'll go down the back stairs,
straight out the service exit.

663
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,779
Arjun, if they find you,
they find us.

664
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:04,114
But if I make it,
we'll have a way out.

665
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:07,409
Sh! Sh!

666
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,996
We can't just let her die here.

667
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:15,000
Okay.

668
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:17,127
Call me when you get out.

669
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:19,087
Deep breath.

670
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:21,089
Shhh. It's okay.

671
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,550
Deep breath.

672
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:26,512
Madam, madam, madam.

673
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,639
I'm going to get you
out of here, okay?

674
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:31,266
But... but there are some stairs.

675
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:33,393
Do you think you can stand?

676
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,064
- Yes.
- Yes? Okay, come on.

677
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:38,732
Slowly. Come on.

678
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:40,734
That's it.

679
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:44,571
- Ma'am, you will be fine.
- Okay.

680
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:46,740
You'll be fine. Arjun is
with you. Don't worry.

681
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:53,181
It's okay. It's okay.

682
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:56,602
It's okay, madam.
It's okay, it's okay.

683
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,858
Sorry.

684
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:28,759
Staff. Staff.

685
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:34,097
Staff, staff. Hotel staff!
Please, please. Hotel staff.

686
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:58,080
Go, go!

687
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:05,689
<i>Imran?</i>

688
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:14,239
Go, go, go.

689
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:19,494
David!

690
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:21,747
Open the door. Open the door!

691
01:08:25,811 --> 01:08:27,020
Sh, sh, sh.

692
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:03,700
Okay, sir.

693
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:05,952
Hey!

694
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:10,248
- Yeah, the front lobby here.
- Uh-huh.

695
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:12,083
Western entrance hall.

696
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,585
Our Ocean Room.

697
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:35,190
There is still some of
the good stuff left.

698
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:40,362
Single malt. 20 years old.

699
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:01,883
What the hell was that?

700
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:08,598
Hey. Stay here and stay down.

701
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,310
<i>It's chaos out here, sir.
We're doing all we can.</i>

702
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:14,729
- Have you sent the men in?
<i>- I'm sorry, what men?</i>

703
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:16,940
- The rescue squad?
<i>- Yes, Mr Oberoi.</i>

704
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:20,068
<i>We sent in a squad hours ago,
but most were killed.</i>

705
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:35,792
Have you sent any Mohit Singh
as part of the squad?

706
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:44,384
Shit.

707
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,890
<i>Yes, Mr Oberoi, Mohit Singh
was part of the squad.</i>

708
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,017
<i>We lost contact hours ago.
We thought he was dead.</i>

709
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:54,644
Okay, thank you.

710
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:03,361
Arjun, I cannot...

711
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:05,155
Don't open the door, it's them!

712
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:24,299
Sir? Sir?

713
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,681
Move! Out!

714
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,600
- Move!
- Down, down, down, down!

715
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,224
Okay.

716
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:19,521
Thank you.

717
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:43,461
Sh, sh, sh,
quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.

718
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:46,631
Down, down, down. Down, down.
Down, down.

719
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:06,711
No, no, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey.

720
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:09,214
It's okay. It's okay.

721
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:16,679
REPORTER, TV:
<i>That was an explosion.</i>

722
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,932
<i>There's lots
of firing inside the hotel.</i>

723

<i>Here they come. They're coming

01:20:33,663 --> 01:20:35,706
Miss Kashani, please, stop it!

747
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,959
- Open it!
- Please come and sit here.

748
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:40,044
I have to be with my family.
Open the door.

749
01:20:40,211 --> 01:20:42,672
I know it's hard but
police are very near now.

750
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:44,590
No-one's coming.

751
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:48,678
We've been here six hours.
Six hours! For what?

752
01:20:48,845 --> 01:20:50,596
No-one's coming for us.

753
01:20:51,848 --> 01:20:55,101
My baby's out there.
Please open the door.

754
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:58,521
She's right.
Open the door.

755
01:20:58,688 --> 01:21:00,147
- I want to go.
- Me too.

756
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:03,109
Please, we cannot evacuate
everyone without being detected.

757
01:21:03,276 --> 01:21:06,946
It's not everyone.
We are six people, that's all.

758
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:08,865
We're going. Open the door.

759
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:10,366
Sir...

760
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:14,078
..if they hear us going,
we will all die.

761
01:21:14,245 --> 01:21:16,998
They know we are here.
If they come back, we all die.

762
01:21:17,164 --> 01:21:19,083
If they bomb the building,
we die.

763
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:21,961
If we leave, maybe we die.
We take our chances.

764
01:21:23,129 --> 01:21:25,798
Open the fucking door.
Now.

765
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:38,895
Very well, sir.

766
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:51,407
- We'll be praying for you, sir.
- Yeah, fuck your prayers.

767
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:53,409
That's what started this shit.

768
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:12,219
Let's go.

769
01:22:40,373 --> 01:22:41,832
Zahra!

770
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:49,256
Hey!

771
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:50,800
This is stupid. Go. Let's go.

772
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:52,677
I'm getting my baby.

773
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:57,098
Run!

774
01:22:58,224 --> 01:22:59,433
Hey!

775
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:13,656
It's okay.

776
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:18,285
They won't kill us.
They want us alive. It's okay.

777
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,720
Where's Cameron?

778
01:24:17,887 --> 01:24:20,014
You don't know me.

779
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:43,621
Indian? Huh?

780
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,501
Animals.

781
01:24:50,503 --> 01:24:51,796
No!

782
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:54,340
No, no, no, no, no! No!

783
01:25:13,651 --> 01:25:15,444
<i>These images,
taken around 4am,</i>

784

<i>show the moment security forces

<i>confronted the two gunmen</i>

786

<i>beating them with sticks.</i>

787

<i>The gunmen had earlier
hijacked a police van,</i>

788
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:28,874
<i>and are thought to have been
behind the CST station attack.</i>

789
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:31,001
<i>Both men suffered
multiple bullet wounds</i>

<i>while the other, Ajmal Kasab,

Sorry, sir. There was
nowhere else to go.

They set fire to the hotel.

839
01:34:42,511 --> 01:34:44,638
It's a baby.
What do you want me to do?

840
01:35:08,704 --> 01:35:11,540
Sally has Cameron.

841
01:35:11,707 --> 01:35:16,169
They're in the utility closet
next to room 415.

- They'll get us killed, Oberoi!
- Please listen, sir.

848
01:35:50,704 --> 01:35:53,039
The central part of the hotel
is burning.

849
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:55,709
Security forces will not be here
in time.

850
01:35:55,876 --> 01:35:57,794
We must leave

851
01:35:57,961 --> 01:35:59,856
by the safety stairs
and out through the kitchens.

852
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,566
They'll find us,
they'll shoot us and kill us.

853
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:03,383
Sir...

854
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:06,219
Sir, the hotel is burning.
This is our only choice.

855
01:36:06,386 --> 01:36:08,764
And everybody trusted you!
We're not safe anymore.

856
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:10,682
Sir, please keep quiet.

857
01:36:10,849 --> 01:36:13,393
Sir. So please switch off
your mobile phones

858
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,562
and be as quiet as possible.

859
01:36:15,729 --> 01:36:17,773
If we are together,
we'll be fine.

860
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,691
Mobile phones off, please.

861
01:36:19,858 --> 01:36:21,985

We're in the Chambers Lounge,
