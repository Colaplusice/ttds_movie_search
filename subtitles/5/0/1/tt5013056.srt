00:00:49,412 --> 00:00:52,404
You.
We surrounded you.

00:02:33,382 --> 00:02:36,351
I'm English. Do not shoot.

4
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:53,334
Go there, take the weapon.

5
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,460
Do not be here.

6
00:07:32,314 --> 00:07:34,305
Where is the air force?

7
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:17,516
The Navy asked for this.

8
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:19,460
We'll be back in 1 hour.

9
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:21,395
That was before.

10
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:25,526
Do not make a mess of
that stuff over there.

11
00:10:23,518 --> 00:10:25,509
It's only for the English.

12
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:28,255
- Can not.
- We can not do this!

13
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:29,484
You have your own ship, back!

14
00:10:30,258 --> 00:10:33,250
Back, you got your ship
Myself, this is a english ship.

15
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:39,256
Bring them here, quick! Move out! Move out!

16
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:41,292
Quick, fast, fast!

17
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:44,330
He will die!

18
00:10:44,373 --> 00:10:48,400
Step aside, step aside, watch everything!

19
00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:05,288
Get ready!

20
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:19,497
All in one! Give more space!

21
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:34,480
Move out!

22
00:11:39,461 --> 00:11:43,488
It's medical, give them a way.

23
00:12:11,526 --> 00:12:14,359
- Lower the rope.
- Yes, Sir!

24
00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:33,440
Their fullness, no
Can you transport them?

25
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:36,342
I have something to say.

26
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,475
I thought you were cornered.

00:13:40,515 --> 00:13:43,416
[VOICE RADIO]

28
00:14:06,508 --> 00:14:09,306
Give the room!

29
00:14:26,328 --> 00:14:28,296
Go ahead.

30
00:15:01,363 --> 00:15:03,490
Get ready up front.

31
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:08,293
Do not we wait for the navy.

32
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:12,364
We're just waiting for
orders, I'm not the captain.

33
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,366
OK.

34
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:19,236
Thank you George.

35
00:15:22,284 --> 00:15:25,344
Heydrick, do you know where we are?

36
00:15:26,554 --> 00:15:31,389
- France.
- No need to wait.

37
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:41,359
How is it there?

38
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:58,285
He's behind me.

39
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,387
I'll take care of him.

40
00:16:49,404 --> 00:16:51,235
Go to the line.

41
00:16:51,272 --> 00:16:53,297
You two go.

42
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:57,368
- Go away!
- We should check the damage.

43
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:37,473
You see..

44
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,349
Whose party is it?

45
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:46,451
Our plane, George.

46
00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:00,231
3, 2, 1 now!

47
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:16,283
Did he fall?

48
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:26,460
Yes, he was destroyed.

49
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:35,198
Our fortress defeated him.

50
00:19:37,505 --> 00:19:40,406
Fortress do you hear me?

51
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,273
Force 2 I have
See the plane, replace it.

52
00:19:49,284 --> 00:19:53,220
Understanding Force 1.

53
00:20:00,395 --> 00:20:01,453
Hello, lieutenant.

54
00:20:01,496 --> 00:20:05,262
- We have to do that, sir.
- Well do that.

55
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:07,359
Go.

56
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:14,332
General, you have to decide how many
Many more have to carry the wounded.

57
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:19,279
No, tell them to
Line up here. Excuse me.

58
00:20:29,324 --> 00:20:32,293
- Let me help you.
- Commander.

59
00:20:33,394 --> 00:20:37,228
- What about our territory?
- Minimizes every day.

60
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:40,325
I have ordered troops
France to hold its ranks.

61
00:20:40,335 --> 00:20:42,303
And his tanks were trapped.

62
00:20:42,337 --> 00:20:44,305
Why get stuck?

63
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:47,365
They think the tank is too
Worth to leave the island.

64
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:50,468
How long do you think they can
Hold it before we get back?

65
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:56,280
Back? Nothing stops here,
We must bring back his troops.

66
00:20:56,351 --> 00:21:00,378
- the next UK and other countries.
- Of course.

67
00:21:00,388 --> 00:21:03,289
We will trust the troops
Bodyguards start from here.

68
00:21:03,324 --> 00:21:07,420
- What?
- Home..

69
00:21:07,428 --> 00:21:08,395
What about France?

70
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:11,421
We are asked to meet
At the meeting place.

71
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:13,434
Prepare the troops
We go together.

72
00:21:13,435 --> 00:21:16,267
- And his new troop?
- We're leaving all.

73
00:21:16,304 --> 00:21:18,465
How many troops
Who's he talking about, sir?

74
00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:23,410
That's only one, 20,000
And we can give 45.

75
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:27,405
There are 400,000 troops
on this beach, sir.

76
00:21:27,415 --> 00:21:29,440
We just have to do our best.

77
00:21:30,485 --> 00:21:33,386
We can not stay here.

78
00:21:34,422 --> 00:21:36,447
We have troops of distance
Far to the western part.

79
00:21:36,457 --> 00:21:38,482
If there is anything else,
Bodyguards are here.

80
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:40,461
They will always be able
Prevent this place.

81
00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:42,395
But it is not possible. Too low.

82
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:48,391
If there is anything to be able to accommodate They
though a small boat, will not Can make them a destroyer.

83
00:21:48,403 --> 00:21:52,237
We will have to reduce that, gentlemen.

84
00:22:38,353 --> 00:22:40,378
Hey!

85
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:42,423
Hey!

86
00:22:42,457 --> 00:22:45,449
Hey! Can you swim?

87
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,429
I can not reach it!

88
00:22:48,463 --> 00:22:51,432
Hold on.

89
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,308
What is your name?

90
00:23:56,364 --> 00:24:00,391
- There's a ship falling down below.
- Did you see anyone?

91
00:24:00,435 --> 00:24:04,303
No .. We'd better leave it alone.

92
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:09,298
- You think he's okay?
- Maybe he should be all right.

93
00:24:09,343 --> 00:24:10,503
Recording position

94
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:15,441
- 1071285.
- 10000?

95
00:24:15,483 --> 00:24:19,317
Let's say 12 to 100 feet.

96
00:24:23,524 --> 00:24:28,291
- Force 2, how much is your fuel?
- 50 gallons, replace.

97
00:24:28,296 --> 00:24:31,356
50 gallons?

98
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:39,239
All right, keep telling me.
Because mine is broken.

99
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,369
- Do you think your fuel is enough?
- I do not know .. I can not see it.

100
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:16,269
- It will be destroyed!
- Thomas!

101
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,430
Go!

102
00:26:23,477 --> 00:26:25,468
- It will be destroyed!
- Thomas!

103
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:28,380
What about the injured?

104
00:26:33,454 --> 00:26:38,323
Hurry up! They will
Sink his ship!

105
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:04,471
Do you want to go inside?
It was much warmer.

106
00:28:04,545 --> 00:28:07,480
A lot of wind here.

107
00:28:10,418 --> 00:28:15,378
Leave him alone, George.
He feels safer here.

108
00:28:15,423 --> 00:28:17,323
He wants to tell us
If we will be in bomb.

109
00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:19,519
Human..

110
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:23,453
I'm still human.

111
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:30,267
Come and help me, George.

112
00:28:43,284 --> 00:28:47,345
OK. We're out for 15 minutes
So it will climb to 2000, replace.

113
00:28:47,388 --> 00:28:48,412
We need more fuel.

114
00:28:48,422 --> 00:28:53,416
No, I do not want to be pursued again.
We'll go up and land there, change.

115
00:28:53,427 --> 00:29:00,390
Understand. Angle 2, replace.

116
00:29:02,403 --> 00:29:06,305
All right, up the stairs .. Let's go
Find you another ship.

117
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:37,493
Welcome.
Keep going down. Down.

118
00:30:37,498 --> 00:30:40,399
Warm and comfortable down there.

119
00:30:40,434 --> 00:30:44,336
Go downstairs.
Grab the blanket.

120
00:30:44,338 --> 00:30:48,240
Make a space. Take a break.

121
00:30:50,477 --> 00:30:53,275
Keep going down there.

122
00:31:38,525 --> 00:31:41,289
So where's your friend?

123
00:31:58,445 --> 00:32:01,278
Maybe we should Find a way out.

124
00:32:02,316 --> 00:32:04,375
This place will be ruined.

125
00:32:38,485 --> 00:32:40,350
Where are our goals?

126
00:32:40,354 --> 00:32:42,379
Dunkirk.

127
00:32:43,524 --> 00:32:47,221
No, they will
Waiting for us there.

128
00:32:47,461 --> 00:32:51,397
We have to go to Dunkirk first.

129
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:54,265
I will not go back there.

130
00:32:54,335 --> 00:32:56,360
I will not be back...

131
00:32:56,537 --> 00:33:01,372
Look, if we go there.
We will die.

132
00:33:07,381 --> 00:33:11,477
I understand, let's change
the direction of the ship.

133
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:18,447
I'm talking to you, hello?
You hear me?

134
00:33:19,526 --> 00:33:24,463
- We have to change the direction of this ship.
- Yes.

135
00:33:29,403 --> 00:33:31,371
This.

136
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:42,280
Your place over there.

137
00:33:47,287 --> 00:33:51,314
Take a break.
It's safe here.

138
00:34:03,504 --> 00:34:05,404
He seemed terrified.

139
00:34:05,406 --> 00:34:09,433
He's in shock, he is
not like usual.

140
00:34:11,478 --> 00:34:15,278
Maybe he will not
Back as before again.

141
00:34:22,456 --> 00:34:25,220
This.

142
00:34:41,308 --> 00:34:44,436
I have to lower my height.

143
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:47,413
40,000 feet.

144
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:54,516
Moves towards 9 o'clock.
Do not let them get mine.

145
00:34:55,255 --> 00:34:59,419
- OK.
- You have to take the right side.

146
00:34:59,493 --> 00:35:02,462
Let's go up first.

147
00:35:53,247 --> 00:35:55,306
Now...!

148
00:36:23,343 --> 00:36:25,334
Oh, my God!

149
00:36:42,496 --> 00:36:44,327
I will fall.

150
00:36:44,331 --> 00:36:47,323
Get out of there.

151
00:37:05,552 --> 00:37:09,420
I'll try to land it.

152
00:37:22,302 --> 00:37:24,293
Yes!

153
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:31,267
Please!

154
00:37:31,278 --> 00:37:35,305
- Help us!
- Please!

155
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:39,410
- Help us!
- Please, someone!

156
00:37:39,419 --> 00:37:43,480
Please..!

157
00:37:47,261 --> 00:37:49,456
Please!

158
00:37:51,298 --> 00:37:54,358
Torpedo...!

159
00:38:00,474 --> 00:38:02,465
No!

160
00:38:02,476 --> 00:38:05,309
What happened?

161
00:38:18,392 --> 00:38:22,453
- Everything goes to the deck.
- Climb to the deck!

162
00:38:44,551 --> 00:38:47,349
There!

163
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,339
Please!

164
00:39:17,284 --> 00:39:18,546
Please!

165
00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:15,435
Hurry up, George.
We do not have time.

166
00:40:19,246 --> 00:40:24,309
- Did you see that?
- Like a Rolls Royce engine.

167
00:40:24,351 --> 00:40:28,310
The sound is normal here.

168
00:40:28,355 --> 00:40:30,516
Hello?

169
00:40:30,524 --> 00:40:35,257
Open the door?
Hello, can you hear me?

170
00:40:36,263 --> 00:40:38,288
Open the door!

171
00:40:38,532 --> 00:40:41,262
You hear me?

172
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:46,269
- What is wrong?
- You're the one who locked him up.

173
00:40:46,306 --> 00:40:49,298
Let him out.
I'll talk to him.

174
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,444
Let me out!

175
00:40:52,479 --> 00:40:57,348
When I was your age, I went to war.

176
00:40:57,384 --> 00:41:02,219
I'm still alive today
To see the children beperang.

177
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,226
There is something strange.
I will continue to follow him.

178
00:41:10,263 --> 00:41:14,427
It decreases to a height of 15,000 feet.

179
00:41:16,503 --> 00:41:19,438
Okay, I understand.

180
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,309
I've recorded it.

181
00:41:25,312 --> 00:41:27,473
Gomez, you accept?

182
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,244
Hey, come on.

183
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:38,350
Come up.

184
00:42:38,385 --> 00:42:41,252
Up!

185
00:42:41,254 --> 00:42:45,315
- We'll help you.
- Please!

186
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:48,384
- They will attack again.
- No!

187
00:42:48,495 --> 00:42:53,455
- Come here!
- They've drowned the ship.

188
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,468
You have to stay calm,
There are many ships here.

189
00:42:55,469 --> 00:42:59,404
You have to help them all!

190
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:02,431
- You got a buoy?
- Correct.

191
00:43:02,475 --> 00:43:07,412
The water is not too cold,
Just swim to the beach.

192
00:43:07,414 --> 00:43:14,343
- There's still a place!
- Just go back to the beach and wait for another boat.

193
00:43:14,387 --> 00:43:19,347
Or just wait here,
We will be back for you guys.

194
00:43:19,392 --> 00:43:21,417
All ready?

195
00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:25,363
Paddle!

196
00:43:25,432 --> 00:43:28,230
Paddle!

197
00:43:29,502 --> 00:43:32,300
Paddle!

198
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:35,274
Paddle!

199
00:43:36,476 --> 00:43:38,376
Paddle!

200
00:43:39,379 --> 00:43:42,246
Paddle!

201
00:43:43,283 --> 00:43:47,310
You can not hide, son.

202
00:43:47,387 --> 00:43:50,322
What do you want to do
there? Seriously.

203
00:43:50,323 --> 00:43:53,383
You're not just an employee there.
Everything is drowning.

204
00:43:53,426 --> 00:43:57,328
Not just you are stranded.

205
00:43:57,364 --> 00:44:01,232
- We have guns.
- Yes, from the exchange of goods.

206
00:44:01,267 --> 00:44:05,294
You can help us
On a rescue boat.

207
00:44:05,338 --> 00:44:08,273
You fools.

208
00:44:08,308 --> 00:44:11,209
I will not go back there.

209
00:44:11,244 --> 00:44:15,203
- Playback.
- I will not spin.

210
00:44:15,248 --> 00:44:17,409
Playback!

211
00:44:17,517 --> 00:44:19,485
Playback!

212
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,284
You're gonna kill us all!

213
00:44:23,323 --> 00:44:26,292
- It is okay...
- Come on, turn back!

214
00:44:27,293 --> 00:44:28,419
George?

215
00:44:28,461 --> 00:44:30,395
George...

216
00:44:32,465 --> 00:44:35,263
She fainted.

217
00:44:35,268 --> 00:44:37,327
Okay, I'll take the medicine.

218
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,270
You'll be all right.

219
00:44:39,272 --> 00:44:41,331
Hold on. Okay...

220
00:44:41,374 --> 00:44:44,241
Okay, I'll keep him here.

221
00:44:44,277 --> 00:44:45,471
This will stop the bleeding.

222
00:44:45,512 --> 00:44:49,278
Yes, so...

223
00:44:49,315 --> 00:44:51,374
Are you all right, George?

224
00:47:13,259 --> 00:47:16,251
Push...!

225
00:49:18,284 --> 00:49:22,414
It's okay, this is it
Part of his war.

226
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,419
You know, that's what I said.

227
00:49:30,496 --> 00:49:32,487
How do you know?

228
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,333
His body was back.

229
00:50:10,336 --> 00:50:11,496
Hey.

230
00:50:17,276 --> 00:50:19,335
Hey, how's it going?

231
00:50:28,421 --> 00:50:32,289
- Hey, how's it going?
- Do not worry.

232
00:50:32,325 --> 00:50:37,422
Come on! It's tied up.
There's no way it can escape.

233
00:50:59,285 --> 00:51:01,412
Do not be afraid.

234
00:51:03,322 --> 00:51:06,519
Hey, young master Dawson.

235
00:51:06,526 --> 00:51:09,290
You never Heard about them.

236
00:51:09,328 --> 00:51:12,422
Are you ok.
Are you alright.

237
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:25,310
I let him go.

238
00:51:27,313 --> 00:51:28,439
I let him go.

239
00:51:28,448 --> 00:51:30,473
That's the only thing
I've done it for him.

240
00:51:30,483 --> 00:51:33,281
It is okay. Drink.

241
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:35,253
I said I got him.

242
00:51:35,288 --> 00:51:38,348
I did what I was taught.

243
00:51:39,325 --> 00:51:42,317
I know one day I will do it.

244
00:51:44,263 --> 00:51:47,391
You know, we can come back.

245
00:51:47,433 --> 00:51:49,526
Maybe they'll see it.

246
00:51:49,535 --> 00:51:52,231
Okay, take a break.

247
00:51:52,271 --> 00:51:55,331
I want you back to
Deck as soon as possible.

248
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:59,401
- Uh ..
- What?

249
00:52:03,282 --> 00:52:06,251
I can not say that.

250
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,410
Sir?

251
00:53:12,451 --> 00:53:15,284
The French army already
Beaten back in the west.

252
00:53:16,289 --> 00:53:19,315
- That's a good development.
- For now.

253
00:53:20,293 --> 00:53:23,387
I want you out of the way.
Get out of the way!

254
00:53:32,538 --> 00:53:36,474
- Where are they?
- They're coming.

255
00:53:37,343 --> 00:53:39,208
No.

256
00:53:39,445 --> 00:53:41,310
No.

257
00:53:42,281 --> 00:53:43,305
What? What?

258
00:53:43,316 --> 00:53:46,251
I think we lost a ship.

259
00:53:46,285 --> 00:53:49,277
The help is here. For
Do they save him?

260
00:53:49,322 --> 00:53:52,314
The next troops,
Who helped England.

261
00:53:52,325 --> 00:53:54,486
They sent her to the same place.

262
00:53:56,395 --> 00:53:59,489
But it's there.

263
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:01,288
They can do it.

264
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,461
Silence alone will not
Helps us to return.

265
00:54:03,502 --> 00:54:06,437
They have to send More ships.

266
00:54:06,439 --> 00:54:09,237
If we are silent,
His enemy will draw near.

267
00:54:09,275 --> 00:54:12,267
Back to the base,
Collect his soldiers.

268
00:54:12,311 --> 00:54:16,338
- What for?
- At least that's what we can do.

269
00:54:16,382 --> 00:54:22,287
Civilians? They
Will destroy it.

270
00:54:22,288 --> 00:54:24,256
The more troops, We can win.

271
00:54:24,257 --> 00:54:25,315
But not in this condition.

272
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:29,294
I prefer like
It is rather than dead.

273
00:54:31,297 --> 00:54:34,289
They're here, they are
Will come here.

274
00:54:36,369 --> 00:54:39,361
They come from the north.

275
00:54:39,372 --> 00:54:42,273
At least we can get ready
To face them.

276
00:54:42,308 --> 00:54:45,300
We're leaving in 6 hours.

277
00:54:45,344 --> 00:54:48,245
I think in three hours.

278
00:54:49,282 --> 00:54:53,343
That's good for your troops, right?

279
00:54:53,386 --> 00:54:56,355
Yes. Of course.

280
00:55:10,403 --> 00:55:14,362
- Where's the crew?
- Maybe apart after being stranded.

281
00:55:14,373 --> 00:55:16,500
Let's check the beach.

282
00:55:16,542 --> 00:55:19,340
- Why?
- Just do my commands.

283
00:55:19,345 --> 00:55:22,212
Anything can be there.

284
00:55:22,281 --> 00:55:25,444
Okay, we check the part
That part. On the other side.

285
00:55:25,451 --> 00:55:27,419
How long?

286
00:55:27,453 --> 00:55:29,478
Maybe 3 hours.

287
00:55:55,481 --> 00:56:00,282
Put pressure on it.
Clean out the blood.

288
00:56:00,486 --> 00:56:03,250
What?

289
00:56:05,391 --> 00:56:08,258
Conditions are bad.

290
00:56:09,395 --> 00:56:11,454
We have to go back.

291
00:56:17,403 --> 00:56:19,462
We've gone this far.

292
00:56:19,505 --> 00:56:22,474
What is our ship?

293
00:56:22,508 --> 00:56:26,274
Right, we're going there.

294
00:56:26,312 --> 00:56:28,280
No, we have to get ready,
There may be survivors.

295
00:56:28,281 --> 00:56:31,340
If we do that, we must
Save ourselves.

296
00:56:35,287 --> 00:56:38,415
I'm going up, looking
Whether they have come.

297
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:46,261
Am I talking too much?

298
00:57:10,356 --> 00:57:12,256
They almost arrived.

299
00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:15,454
Calm down. We'll be back, right?

300
00:57:15,494 --> 00:57:18,361
Yes, but how long?

301
00:57:25,438 --> 00:57:28,464
That's them!

302
00:57:34,246 --> 00:57:36,237
Spitfire plane!

303
00:57:43,289 --> 00:57:45,314
No, no..

304
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:55,230
- See what they do!
- Yes.

305
00:58:02,274 --> 00:58:05,334
They show us direction.

306
00:58:07,546 --> 00:58:10,379
Yes.

307
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:12,350
No, no..

308
00:58:13,385 --> 00:58:16,377
They're heading to the Spitfire!

309
00:58:16,422 --> 00:58:19,357
Get ready!

310
00:58:25,331 --> 00:58:27,231
Hey..

311
00:59:15,247 --> 00:59:16,475
- No, no, no.
- Who is that?

312
00:59:16,515 --> 00:59:20,508
- Are you German?
- No, Netherlands!

313
00:59:21,387 --> 00:59:23,252
I'm Dutch.

314
00:59:23,255 --> 00:59:26,383
- I'm here to help you guys.
- How can we be sure?

315
00:59:26,392 --> 00:59:28,326
I know the Germans are coming.

316
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:32,387
They waited on their shores,
Waiting for the tidal wave.

317
00:59:32,398 --> 00:59:35,265
We will back.

318
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:40,295
They will come. We must
Sailing in a few hours.

319
00:59:40,372 --> 00:59:42,465
A few hours? Why are you back?

320
00:59:43,309 --> 00:59:47,541
I do not have anything, because
That's me not so go.

321
00:59:58,524 --> 01:00:01,357
Seriously!

322
01:00:05,364 --> 01:00:08,265
How's it going, Collins?

323
01:00:34,293 --> 01:00:36,454
His plane crashed.

324
01:01:16,335 --> 01:01:17,359
No.

325
01:01:17,403 --> 01:01:21,271
It's because of the engine,
the engine is dead.

326
01:01:21,273 --> 01:01:23,434
No ships.

327
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,471
Dad, come on, no boats!

328
01:01:27,546 --> 01:01:32,245
- Maybe he's dead.
- Be quiet! I heard you!

329
01:01:33,285 --> 01:01:37,221
Do not be noisy, shut up!

330
01:01:37,256 --> 01:01:40,316
Maybe we can help him.

331
01:02:32,411 --> 01:02:34,504
Do not! They do not know
We are in here.

332
01:02:34,513 --> 01:02:37,243
Why are they shooting at us?

333
01:02:37,282 --> 01:02:40,445
We must hide.

334
01:02:42,354 --> 01:02:45,323
Tommy, you can do this.

335
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,351
Where are you?

336
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:50,311
They're coming ..

337
01:03:50,322 --> 01:03:52,256
Come on, come on, come on.

338
01:04:10,475 --> 01:04:12,272
We have to close it.

339
01:04:12,311 --> 01:04:14,245
How to?

340
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,230
Come on. Hurry up.

341
01:04:43,475 --> 01:04:45,340
How do we get out of here?

342
01:04:45,344 --> 01:04:46,504
We have to open this place.

343
01:04:46,545 --> 01:04:48,512
Wait! We have to wait.

344
01:04:48,513 --> 01:04:51,482
- Wait. Wait.
- Yes.

345
01:04:52,284 --> 01:04:55,412
Someone... Somebody has to get out.

346
01:04:56,255 --> 01:04:57,415
Who wants to volunteer?

347
01:04:57,422 --> 01:04:59,390
I do not need volunteers.

348
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:02,256
I need someone who is brave.

349
01:05:03,528 --> 01:05:05,359
You're the one who goes up.

350
01:05:06,265 --> 01:05:08,495
He's a German spy. Let him alone.

351
01:05:08,533 --> 01:05:14,267
He's a spy and we're not
Telling him who he is.

352
01:05:15,307 --> 01:05:16,501
Do you agree?

353
01:05:17,276 --> 01:05:19,267
You do not speak English.

354
01:05:19,311 --> 01:05:22,371
If he survived to
Germany, we will be finished.

355
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:24,440
Certain. Tell him.

356
01:05:24,449 --> 01:05:26,280
Yes.

357
01:05:29,354 --> 01:05:30,480
Tell me.

358
01:05:57,349 --> 01:05:59,510
Tell me, Gibson.

359
01:06:08,327 --> 01:06:09,453
Tell me!

360
01:06:09,494 --> 01:06:12,224
For God's sake, just let me know.

361
01:06:14,366 --> 01:06:19,201
Austin, he's with Austin.

362
01:06:20,372 --> 01:06:22,237
Shit.

363
01:06:22,407 --> 01:06:24,375
Shit.

364
01:06:24,409 --> 01:06:28,345
Damn coward.

365
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:29,506
It belongs to Gibson, is not it?

366
01:06:29,548 --> 01:06:32,381
It belongs to British soldiers
Who is brave, not yours.

367
01:06:32,384 --> 01:06:35,376
It is not worthy of your use.

368
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:36,352
He's my friend.

369
01:06:36,355 --> 01:06:37,344
Maybe he killed him.

370
01:06:37,389 --> 01:06:38,413
He... he did not kill him.

371
01:06:38,423 --> 01:06:39,355
How do we know?

372
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:42,327
How difficult is it to find a corpse
British soldiers on the beach?

373
01:06:42,361 --> 01:06:46,422
He did not kill anyone.
He's just like all of us.

374
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:53,337
I think he gave Code to them.

375
01:06:53,338 --> 01:06:55,363
Try all sorts, And I'll shoot.

376
01:06:55,374 --> 01:06:56,466
This ship is still drowning.

377
01:06:56,508 --> 01:06:58,237
Correct.

378
01:06:58,243 --> 01:07:00,234
We must trust each other.

379
01:07:00,412 --> 01:07:03,472
When we get out of here
I will interrogate you.

380
01:07:03,515 --> 01:07:04,482
Hurry up.

381
01:07:04,516 --> 01:07:05,483
Come up.

382
01:07:05,517 --> 01:07:08,281
When your head comes out
We will know it.

383
01:07:08,286 --> 01:07:10,447
Are you guys, Or a real soldier

384
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:12,252
That is not fair.

385
01:07:12,257 --> 01:07:13,281
Something to hold on
Life is never fair.

386
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:14,485
That's bullshit.

387
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,418
Hurry up.

388
01:07:16,461 --> 01:07:17,485
I will not hesitate.

389
01:07:17,496 --> 01:07:20,226
It represents thousands of people.

390
01:07:20,265 --> 01:07:21,357
Shit.

391
01:07:22,401 --> 01:07:23,493
He sent something to Lars.

392
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:26,232
I knew it.

393
01:07:27,506 --> 01:07:31,465
Somebody has to get out
So we can all live.

394
01:07:32,244 --> 01:07:33,268
Do you know what that means?

395
01:07:33,311 --> 01:07:36,303
No. I do not know.

396
01:07:36,314 --> 01:07:38,373
This is the price of lies.

397
01:07:42,521 --> 01:07:46,389
I'll go with
he. This is wrong.

398
01:07:46,391 --> 01:07:48,256
Hurry up.

399
01:07:49,394 --> 01:07:51,362
With or without me
Will make a lot of difference.

400
01:07:51,363 --> 01:07:54,491
Of course, if you continue to defend him
I also do not hesitate to shoot you.

401
01:07:56,468 --> 01:07:59,266
Hurry up.

402
01:07:59,304 --> 01:08:01,272
You are stupid.

403
01:08:14,419 --> 01:08:16,444
Turn off the engine.

404
01:08:54,392 --> 01:08:56,257
Thanks.

405
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:48,336
Sorry, I do not understand.

406
01:09:50,282 --> 01:09:52,341
Maybe you're not proven guilty.

407
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,413
You've done your best.

408
01:10:09,301 --> 01:10:10,290
Stop wasting time.

409
01:10:10,335 --> 01:10:12,496
I understand your frustration, colonel.

410
01:10:13,271 --> 01:10:14,363
Johnny.

411
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:20,301
The ship was attacked.

412
01:10:20,345 --> 01:10:22,438
Looks like they're gonna head over here.

413
01:10:26,318 --> 01:10:27,444
Here it is.

414
01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:46,226
What do you see?

415
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,331
Hope.

416
01:13:40,478 --> 01:13:41,467
Is she all right?

417
01:13:41,513 --> 01:13:43,310
Son?

418
01:13:44,482 --> 01:13:46,279
No.

419
01:13:46,317 --> 01:13:47,511
No. She's not all right.

420
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:00,456
Exit!

421
01:14:31,429 --> 01:14:33,488
There are people at sea!

422
01:15:18,376 --> 01:15:19,502
Oil.

423
01:15:20,545 --> 01:15:23,514
Oil. You are all exposed to oil.

424
01:15:58,516 --> 01:16:00,381
They keep coming.

425
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:02,479
Do not hesitate.

426
01:16:07,492 --> 01:16:09,460
All right, crack your hand.

427
01:16:45,263 --> 01:16:47,322
Leave the boat!

428
01:16:47,332 --> 01:16:49,300
Leave the boat!

429
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:10,444
Catch him!

430
01:17:10,455 --> 01:17:12,355
Do not leave him!

431
01:18:04,308 --> 01:18:05,468
Under the deck.

432
01:18:59,263 --> 01:19:05,498
Sergeant, we have to save people
As much as possible before the oil
Reach us and make us burn.

433
01:19:08,372 --> 01:19:09,464
Keep up.

434
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:14,278
Be careful down there.

435
01:19:14,312 --> 01:19:16,371
Be careful down there.

436
01:19:17,381 --> 01:19:19,246
He's dead, man.

437
01:19:24,288 --> 01:19:26,381
Then be more careful.

438
01:19:50,248 --> 01:19:51,476
Are you okay?

439
01:19:52,383 --> 01:19:53,475
Son?

440
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:00,448
Nice.

441
01:21:20,338 --> 01:21:22,329
The plane returned.

442
01:21:22,506 --> 01:21:25,441
The plane is back!

443
01:21:29,413 --> 01:21:31,506
Come on, their opponent, come on.

444
01:21:46,464 --> 01:21:48,398
The ship!

445
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:03,437
- He'll turn around and fight them.
- Come on ..

446
01:22:20,331 --> 01:22:22,390
No!

447
01:22:55,399 --> 01:22:57,299
Let's go.

448
01:23:00,471 --> 01:23:03,338
Street! Street! Come on! Hurry up!

449
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:43,379
Come on.

450
01:23:51,288 --> 01:23:53,313
Thank you very much.

451
01:24:45,276 --> 01:24:47,267
Where are you from

452
01:24:47,311 --> 01:24:49,506
North Dover.

453
01:24:51,449 --> 01:24:53,314
Make a deal.

454
01:24:53,317 --> 01:24:54,375
Yes, sir.

455
01:24:54,418 --> 01:24:57,444
Enter the ship into the port.

456
01:24:58,322 --> 01:25:00,313
And thanks!

457
01:25:44,401 --> 01:25:49,304
- That's an enemy plane.
- Yes. And that's in South, take me there.

458
01:25:49,306 --> 01:25:54,243
This is an instruction from me.
Sailing to the South.

459
01:26:03,487 --> 01:26:05,352
Now!

460
01:26:42,293 --> 01:26:43,260
The plane was gone.

461
01:26:43,294 --> 01:26:44,488
Yes there is a bigger fish to be fried.

462
01:26:44,528 --> 01:26:47,292
How can you know that?

463
01:26:47,298 --> 01:26:51,428
My son is often here. Me
Knew he had done it.

464
01:26:53,404 --> 01:26:55,372
You ever come here?

465
01:26:56,307 --> 01:26:59,504
No. Not me, my brother.

466
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:04,379
Hailed by the storm, died
before going to war.

467
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:46,218
Please, stay below.

468
01:27:46,323 --> 01:27:48,382
I just want to see it.

469
01:27:55,299 --> 01:27:56,266
Beautiful.

470
01:27:56,267 --> 01:27:57,495
Beautiful.

471
01:27:58,235 --> 01:27:59,327
Is that Dover?

472
01:27:59,370 --> 01:28:02,396
No, that's Dorset.

473
01:28:02,406 --> 01:28:04,374
It's home.

474
01:28:06,277 --> 01:28:08,404
We're going to your town, huh?

475
01:28:47,484 --> 01:28:49,213
Oh God.

476
01:28:49,253 --> 01:28:51,312
How can you get there?

477
01:29:08,405 --> 01:29:10,396
Where are we?

478
01:29:17,381 --> 01:29:19,372
Where are we?

479
01:29:26,357 --> 01:29:28,484
They know where you are.

480
01:30:03,527 --> 01:30:05,324
Just wait.

481
01:30:05,362 --> 01:30:07,330
Wait for friends.

482
01:30:07,498 --> 01:30:09,329
Just wait.

483
01:30:09,333 --> 01:30:11,324
Wait a second, guys.

484
01:30:12,403 --> 01:30:14,337
Just wait.

485
01:30:14,471 --> 01:30:17,235
All we do is survive.

486
01:30:17,274 --> 01:30:18,536
That's enough.

487
01:30:26,483 --> 01:30:28,348
Just wait.

488
01:30:28,352 --> 01:30:30,252
Just wait.

489
01:30:44,501 --> 01:30:48,232
The beggar does not even
want to see our eyes.

490
01:31:10,427 --> 01:31:12,486
Is there an officer here?

491
01:31:12,496 --> 01:31:16,330
Any news from the enemy?

492
01:31:16,333 --> 01:31:19,302
This is not the time to be special.

493
01:31:21,538 --> 01:31:22,470
Just wait.

494
01:31:22,473 --> 01:31:24,441
We lost 30 people.

495
01:31:24,475 --> 01:31:26,443
And some others.

496
01:31:27,244 --> 01:31:29,405
Nearly 300ribu.

497
01:31:32,382 --> 01:31:34,407
So far.

498
01:31:35,486 --> 01:31:37,351
So far?

499
01:31:37,354 --> 01:31:39,322
I stay here.

500
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:41,458
For French troops.

501
01:32:32,476 --> 01:32:35,445
Hey! Where do we arrive?

502
