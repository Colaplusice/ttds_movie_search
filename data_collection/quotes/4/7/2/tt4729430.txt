Klaus: We need to show people that a true, selfless act always sparks another.
Klaus: A true selfless act always sparks another.
Jesper: What happened to him after that, how, why, I can't even begin to comprehend. I stopped trying to make sense of it a long time ago. But I do know: once, every year, I get to see my friend.
Klaus: I'm coming, my love.
Klaus: Ho ho ho!
Jesper: Wait, wait, wait. Time out. Really? THAT'S how you laugh?
Klaus: What happen-?
Jesper: Not a word. You just sit there. And be all magical and awesome.
Jesper: Letters. You don't really write many these days, do you? But I bet there's one you never forget. Send it off to a certain plump guy in a red suit and, provided you've kept your act together more or less, he'll drop off a toy or two. And yet, no one seems to wonder how the whole thing got started in the first place. This is a story about letters, and it began .. with this one...
Jesper: Good morning, madam! Ah, and a good morning it is indeed! For, you see, today is the day when progress arrives in this charming little town of yours! Now, let me steal a few moments of your time to introduce to you the novel concept that is the postal service...
Jesper: Awww, aren't you the cutest little thing! Tell me, sweetie, is your mommy home?
Jesper: Hello?
Jesper: Mister Klaus, you have a gift. You were meant for making toys. So, I figured, if you donate your old toys, I'll deliver them for free!
Klaus: Tonight. I go with you.
Jesper: There's no need for you to come with me, really.
Jesper: Tonight then.
Alva: Hey! What do you guys think you're doing? This is Smeerensburg, the unhappiest place on Earth. And you two can't change that!
Jesper: Ha! Eat our snow, you-
Jesper: They're not attached. Why aren't they attached? I thought they were attached. I never in a million years would've done what I just did if I didn't think these were attached.
Mrs. Krum: This town was built on resentment and spite. And it'll stay that way as long as a Krum...
Mr. Ellingboe: Or an Ellingboe!
Mrs. Krum: Ugh. Have something to say about it.
Jesper: Come on! We're running out of time! Those kids are counting on us!
Mrs. Krum: Do you know what this is, little boy?
Mr. Ellingboe: This is tradition!
Mrs. Krum: Centuries of glorious hatred, passed down through generations!There was the hundred-day brawl of '45...
Mr. Ellingboe: ...which we totally won!
Mrs. Krum: The maritime game of chicken.
Mr. Ellingboe: The Great Mooning of '86.
Mrs. Krum: So, if there's something we know...
Mr. Ellingboe: ...going back as far as we can remember...
Mrs. Krum: ...it's that a Krum despises an Ellingboe...
Mr. Ellingboe: ...and an Ellingboe can't stand a Krum!
Mrs. Krum: Look around, Aksel! Where is your clan?
Mr. Ellingboe: Uh...
Mrs. Krum: I'll tell you where they are - they're at block parties! Hayrides! And COOK-OUTS!
Additional Adults Voices: Don't forget about the brunches!
Ellingboe Councilwoman: It was a book club that took my poor Sven!
Mrs. Krum: You see? The postman and that old toy maker are brainwashing everyone!
Mr. Ellingboe: What are you saying?
Mrs. Krum: I'm saying it's time to join forces against a common enemy! I'm saying... we need a TRUCE.
Mr. Ellingboe: A truce? Have you gone mad?
Mrs. Krum: Either we band together to take care of this, or it's gonna be all book clubs and cookouts from here on...
Additional Adults Voices: And brunches! Don't forget about the brunches!
Mrs. Krum: Yes, that. That too.
Mr. Ellingboe: So... we must join together in peace, to stop this peace?
Jesper: He's here to finish the job! Oh no!
Annelise: Mr. Postman? Are you in there?
Jesper: Go away! Go! Leave! He'll hear you!
Mrs. Krum: Well now, isn't this convenient?
Klaus: What are you doing here?
Mrs. Krum: Why, we were just thinking... don't our children also deserve a present?
Mr. Ellingboe: And lookee here - you've already got her favorite thing in the world! A nice, big pi√±ata!
Alva: Hey, you put one hand on those toys, and I swear...!
Klaus: Stand back! All right, do what you will with the toys. But no one gets hurt!
Mrs. Krum: Suits us just fine. How long until children go back to the old ways once there are no toys to bribe them with? How long until they turn against each other? And how long until the grownups follow?
