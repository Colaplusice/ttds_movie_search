Peppe: Eva, how do you know if you're in love?
Eva: Why are you asking me?
Peppe: You study these things.
Bianca: I'll tell you. If you talk to her for 30 minutes a day, you're in love.
Peppe: What if I talk for 60 minutes?
Carlotta: Then you're madly in love.
Lele: Then you stop talking, which means you're married!
Peppe: I want to be the meaning of my own life.
Rocco: Not to turn every argument into a fight for supremacy. I don't believe it's weak to be the one to give in. In fact, I think it's wise. The only couples I see who last are those where one of the two manages to take a step back, but is really a step ahead.
Bianca: I didn't even want to get married. I never believed in marriage. Marriage makes me sad and anxious. I didn't want a child, either. What do I know about bringing kids up? I just wanted to be free. Then that asshole came along and turned my life upside-down. He made me believe we could be happy and I trusted him, but...
Eva: If I were cheating, I wouldn't have suggested this game.
Lele: Or you are and you want to be found out. There's this psychological mechanism according to which serial-killers do all they can to get found out.
Rocco: Exes are dangerous.
Lele: They're like the Japanese, they never give up.
Carlotta: Why haven't we split up? People should learn how to split up.
Peppe: Because if you love someone, you protect them, from everything.
