Rainer Wenger: About the project week...
Dieter Wieland: Yes, and?
Rainer Wenger: Can we switch? I got autocracy.
Dieter Wieland: Alea iacta est. The die has been cast.
Rainer Wenger: You know I wanted anarchy.
Dieter Wieland: A little bit to much. The project week is about teaching the students the benefits of democracy. The making of Molotov Cocktails is a subject for chemistry. Have a nice day.
