Aditya D, Kashyap: Geet. Don't ever do that. Okay?
Geet Kaur Dhillon: I am doing it. Everything is planned. I have come to say bye to you.
Aditya D, Kashyap: You are leaving NOW? As in, RIGHT NOW?

Geet Kaur Dhillon: Big deal. What difference does that make to you?
Aditya D, Kashyap: Correct. What difference does that make to me?
Geet Kaur Dhillon: Come on, let's go.
Geet Kaur Dhillon: Mister, are you convinced or shall I say more?
Geet Kaur Dhillon: You are so selfish. You are thinking only about yourself. What about me?
Aditya D, Kashyap: What about YOU? This is YOUR life. It's YOUR plan. You are going to elope. What am I doing here? I mean, I am taking the risk of running away with the girl, people are looking for me to murder me, and I don't even GET the girl!
