Doris: I'm unhappy.
George Valentin: So are millions of us.
Al Zimmer: Perfect! Beautiful! Could you give me just one more?
George Valentin: With pleasure.
George Valentin: If only he could talk.
Peppy Miller: I won't work anymore. It's either him or me.
Peppy Miller: What I mean is, it's him AND me! Or it's neither of us!
Peppy Miller: Hey, I'm blackmailing you! Get it?
Assistant Director: And... action!
Al Zimmer: You and I belong to another era, George. The world is talking now. People want new faces, talking faces. I wish it wasn't like this, but the public wants fresh meat, and the public is never wrong.
George Valentin: I'm the one people come to see. They never needed to hear me.
George Valentin: Look what's become of you... You've been stupid! You've been proud!
George Valentin: Get back here, you loser!
George Valentin: I won't talk! I won't say a word!
Doris: Why won't you talk?
George Valentin: I've made way for you.
Peppy Miller: Make way for the young!
