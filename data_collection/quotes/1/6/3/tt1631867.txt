Rita Vrataski: What do we do now?
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: I don't know. We've never gotten this far.
Rita Vrataski: Why does it matter what happens to me?
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: I wish I didn't know you, but I do.
Rita Vrataski: Come find me when you wake up!
Rita Vrataski: Yes? What do you want?
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: I'm not a soldier.
Rita Vrataski: Of course not. You're a weapon.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Stop! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Stop! Wait a second, wait a second! I've been thinking... I mean, this thing is in my blood. So maybe there's some way I can transfer it to you.
Rita Vrataski: I've tried everything, it doesn't work.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: I mean have you tried... you know... tried ALL the options.
Rita Vrataski: Oh, you mean sex? Yeah, tried it.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: ...how many times?
Rita Vrataski: Alright...
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Master Sergeant Farell, you're an American.
Master Sergeant Farell: *No,* sir. I'm from *Kentucky.*
Rita Vrataski: You all right, Cage?
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: I think I broke something...
Rita Vrataski: What?
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: My back. The only thing I can feel are my lips.
Rita Vrataski: Now listen carefully. This is a very important rule. This is the only rule. You get injured on the field, you better make sure you die.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Why?
Rita Vrataski: Last time I was in combat, I was hit. I was bleeding out, just not fast enough. I woke up in a field hospital with three pints of someone else's blood and I was out. I lost the power, do you understand? Think we better start over, don't you?
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: What?
Rita Vrataski: Master Sergeant Farell: Battle is the Great Redeemer. It is the fiery crucible in which true heroes are forged. The one place where all men truly share the same rank, regardless of what kind of parasitic scum they were going in.
Cruel Sergeant: On your feet, maggot!
Cage: What I am about to tell you sounds crazy. But you have to listen to me. Your very lives depend on it. You see, this isn't the first time.
Dr. Carter: Have you seen anything strange?
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Is he shitting me?
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: What day is it?
Master Sergeant Farell: For you? Judgement day.
Rita Vrataski: If it's all the same to you, I'm tired, I'm in pain. I'd rather just start fresh.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Tell you what. Take a few minutes. Coffee's ready. I'll look around for the keys. That's productive.
Rita Vrataski: Ten minutes.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Okay.
Rita Vrataski: And then I'm killing you.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Fine.
Rita Vrataski: We should just reset.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Listen, man, I've never been in one of these.
Griff: Yeah, well, I've never been with two girls at the same time before. But you can bet, when that day comes, I'll make it work.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: I'm sorry! I'm trying to save you. We're getting slaughtered, you need to get us off this beach.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: We have to go. This drop ship is about to explode. We have to go now!
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Wait.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Come on!
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Come on!
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Come on! This ship is going to explode!
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: What are you doing?
Rita Vrataski: Find me when you wake up.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: What?
Rita Vrataski: Come find me when you wake up...
Master Sergeant Farell: What the hell were you thinking?
Master Sergeant Farell: two minutes to drop, it's alright to be scared. Remember, there is no courage without fear.
Master Sergeant Farell: Knock off the grab ass!
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Grab this, Sarge!
Master Sergeant Farell: Hold up! Drop and give me...
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Fifty, Sarge?
Master Sergeant Farell: That's right, fifty. Platoon! Drop and give me fifty, compliments of Private Cage.
Skinner: Hey Mate! I think there's something wrong with your suit, There's a dead guy in it
Master Sergeant Farell: Drop or die!
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: I need three more clips of five-five-six, 8 grenades and an extra battery.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Get it.
Master Sergeant Farell: Take care of Private Cage.
Griff: What, all day?
Master Sergeant Farell: Something tells me it won't be nearly that long.
Master Sergeant Farell: I see everyone is having a productive morning. You know it gives me a swell of pride knowing soldiers of your... caliber will be leading the charge tomorrow. Tip of the spear. Edge of the knife.
Master Sergeant Farell: Crack of my ass.
Ford: Hey, you better watch your back out there... Sir.
Nance: Cuz no one else will.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: We've been through worse.
Master Sergeant Farell: Here they come, mean as hell and thick as grass!
Unknown Soldier at Battle of Rorke's Drift, 1879: Here they come, black as hell and thick as grass!
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: I'm hit, I'm hit. How bad is it?
Rita Vrataski: You've got a hole in your chest.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Did you just take my... battery, battery pack?
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: No, no, no, no, no... HOLY FU...
Griff: Where's your helmet?
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Never wear one... It's a distraction.
Master Sergeant Farell: Can I help you, sir?
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Sergeant Farell?
Master Sergeant Farell: That is my name.
Master Sergeant Farell: I think I get it, what was it? Poker night? Bachelor party?
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Lt. Col. Bill Cage: You know, I'm not sure.
Dr. Carter: Rita! Rita! What is this? What are you doing here? Look, who's this guy?
Rita Vrataski: He's me...
Rita Vrataski,Â Lt. Col. Bill Cage: ...before Verdun.
Dr. Carter: What... what do you mean? He's...?
Rita Vrataski: Yes! Yes!
Dr. Carter: When did he die? Where?
Rita Vrataski: On the beach, tomorrow.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: I'm Bill Cage, you're Dr. Carter, we've had this conversation before. You have two fingers behind your back. I've had the visions, I've seen the Omega.
Rita Vrataski: You're a good man, Cage. I wish I had the chance to know you better.
Griff: Why would we follow him into combat?
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: I don't expect you to follow me. I expect you to follow her.
Griff: That's the Full Metal Bitch.
Rita Vrataski: Have I got something on my face soldier?
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: You don't talk much.
Rita Vrataski: I'm not a fan.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: Of talking?
Rita Vrataski: Not a fan of talking. No.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: You know, you eventually do talk to me. It's usually around Lyons. You tell me about the time you went there with your family. Your brother got lost.
Rita Vrataski: I've never been to Lyons.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: You tell me your middle name. Peyton.
Rita Vrataski: That's not my middle name.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: You find your brother in the arcade, by the way.
Lt. Col. Bill Cage: I'm going to tell you a story. It's going to sound ridiculous. The longer I talk, the more rational it's going to appear.
Nance: Oh, for Christ's sake Kimmel!
Kimmel: I gotta be free man!
