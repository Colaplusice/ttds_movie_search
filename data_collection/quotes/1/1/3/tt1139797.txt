Oskar: Are you a vampire?
Eli: I live off blood... Yes.
Oskar: Are you... dead?
Eli: No. Can't you tell?
Oskar: But... Are you old?
Eli: I'm twelve. But I've been twelve for a long time.
Oskar: Eli... Can you and I be together?
Eli: What do you mean?
Oskar: Well... Will you be my girlfriend?
Eli: Oskar... I'm not a girl.
Oskar: You're not?
Oskar: Can we be together?
Eli: Can't we just be how we are?
Oskar: I guess...
Eli: Do you do something special if you're "together"?
Oskar: No.
Eli: We stay just as we were?
Oskar: Yes.
Eli: Then I agree...
Oskar: What?
Eli: We can be "together".
Oskar: Really?
Eli: Yes.
Oskar: Good.
Oskar: How old are you?
Eli: Twelve... more or less.
Eli: What about you?
Oskar: Twelve years, eight months and nine days. What do you mean, "more or less"?
Oskar: When's your birthday?
Eli: I don't know.
Oskar: Don't you celebrate your birthday? Your parents... they've got to know.
Eli: Oskar: Then you don't get any birthday presents, do you?
Eli: No.
Eli: I'm twelve. But I've been twelve for a long time.
Oskar: Who are you?
Eli: I'm like you.
Oskar: What do you mean?
Eli: What are you staring at? Well?
Eli: Are you looking at me?
Eli: So scream! Squeal!
Eli: Those were the first words I heard you say.
Oskar: I don't kill people.
Eli: No, but you'd like to. If you could... To get revenge. Right?
Oskar: Yes.
Eli: Oskar, I do it because I have to.
Eli: Be me, for a while.
Eli: Please Oskar... Be me, for a little while.
Oskar: Squeal like a pig. So, squeal.
Eli: Oskar... Do you like me?
Oskar: Yeah, a lot.
Eli: If I wasn't a girl... would you like me anyway?
Oskar: I suppose so.
Eli: You have to invite me in.
Oskar: What happens if I don't? What happens if you walk in anyway?
Oskar: Is there something in the way?
Jimmy: You stay under water for three minutes. If you can do it, I'll just nick you.
Jimmy: But if you can't, I'll poke one of your eyes out. An eye for an ear, right?
Martin: Let's go, Conny.
Jimmy: I told you to shut up!
Lacke: Thank you again for another evening steeped in merriment and friendship.
