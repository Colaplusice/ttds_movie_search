Mikael Blomkvist: For fuck's sake, Lisbeth. His father trained him to murder at age sixteen. Anyone would be sick in the head with that kind of upbringing.
Lisbeth Salander: Shut up about the victimizisation! He almost killed you. He raped and murdered and he enjoyed it. He had the same chances as us to chose what he wanted to be. He was no victim. He was a sadistic motherfucker who hated women.
Mikael Blomkvist: I would have never done it, Lisbeth, but I understand why you did. I don't know what you have experienced, but I was about to die in that cellar, and you saved my life. Whatever you have seen, you don't need to tell me. I'm just happy that you're here.
Mikael Blomkvist: What has happened to you? How did you turn out this way? You know everything about me. I don't know shit about you. Not a damn thing.
Lisbeth Salander: That's the way it is.
Mikael Blomkvist: Why?
Martin Vanger: Why what?
Mikael Blomkvist: All of this?
Martin Vanger: Why not? I do what every man dreams of. I take what I want.
Mikael Blomkvist: How many women after the first?
Martin Vanger: I don't know. I've lost count. I had a girl in that cage when we were dining upstairs. Those kind of women disappear all the time. No one misses them.
Dirch Frode: What can you tell me about Blomkvist?
Lisbeth Salander: Everything is in the report.
Dirch Frode: The short version.
Lisbeth Salander: Blomkvist got the nickname Kalle Blomkvist when he solved a bank robbery in the 80s. He's a very public person with no major secrets. Read the newspaper articles.
Dirch Frode: But does he have any secrets?
Lisbeth Salander: Everyone has secrets.
Lisbeth Salander: Come and get it, you cunt!
Lisbeth Salander: I've never done this before. Hold still, or it'll get messy.
