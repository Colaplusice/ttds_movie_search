GERTY: I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.
Sam Bell: You'd be okay?
GERTY: Of course. The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I finished rebooting.
Sam Bell: Gerty, we're not programmed. We're people, do you understand?
Sam Bell: You've been up here too long man. You've lost your marbles.
Eve: Hello?
Sam Bell: Is this the Bell residence?
Eve: This is the Bell residence. Could you call back? There's something wrong with the picture.
Sam Bell: I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
Eve: I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
Sam Bell: Are you sure?
Eve: Yeah, I think so. I'm her daughter. Can I help you?
Sam Bell: ...Eve?
Eve: Yeah.
Sam Bell: Hi! Hi, Eve. How old... How old are you now?
Eve: I'm 15. Do I know you?
Sam Bell: Sweetheart... How did mommy die, sweetheart? How did mommy die?
Eve: Dad!
Dad: Yeah.
Eve: There's someone asking about mom.
Dad: Who's asking about mom?
Sam Bell: Are you OK with that?
GERTY: I'm here to keep you safe, Sam. I want to help you.
Sam Bell: Gerty, is there someone else in the room?
GERTY: Sam, I can only account for what occurs on this base.
Sam Bell: You look like a radioactive tampon... like a banana with a yeast infection.
Sam Bell: Well then I'm goin back, that's it for me.
Clone #2: Pfft!
Sam Bell: What?
Clone #2: Is that what you really think?
Sam Bell: Yea, I've got a contract... I'm, I'm goin home.
Clone #2: You're a fuckin' clone, you don't have shit!
Sam Bell: Hey, I'm goin home!
Clone #2: You're not going anywhere! You know you've been up here too long man, you've lost your marbles. Whuddya think, that Tess is back home waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie? What about the original Sam, Uh?
Sam Bell: I'M THE ORIGINAL SAM... I'M SAM FUCKIN' BELL, ME! ME!
Clone #2: Hey, whoa!
Sam Bell: Gerty, am I clone?
GERTY: Are you hungry?
Clone #2: Hey, hey... don't get your fuckin' panties in a twist. I'm in the same boat, asshole!
Sam Bell: Listen, why don't you relax. Why don't you take a pill, bake a cake, go read the encyclopedia.
Talk Show Host: You know what, he's one of two things. He's a whacko or an illegal immigrant. Either way, they need to lock him up. Line two!
GERTY: Sam, get some sleep. You're very tired.
Sam Bell: I wanna go home.
Computer: Searching for long-range comms.
GERTY: Would you like some hot sauce on your beans?
Sam Bell: No, my tummy's a little tender, actually. But, thank you. Thank you, Gerty.
Sam Bell: There was a time when energy was a dirty word. When turning on your light was a hard choice. Cities in brown-out. Food shortages, cars burning fuel to run. But that was the past. Where are we now? How do we make the world so much better? Make deserts bloom? Right now we are the largest producer of fusion energy in the world. The energy of the sun trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon. Today we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3 to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet. Who'd have thought? All the energy we ever needed right above our heads. The power of the moon. The power of our future.
