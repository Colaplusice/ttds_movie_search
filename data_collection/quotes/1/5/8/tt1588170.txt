Kim Soo-hyeon: I will kill you when you are in the most pain. When you're in the most pain, shivering out of fear, then I will kill you. That's a real revenge. A real complete revenge.
Kyung-chul: Hey. Cut the bullshit. You already lost. You think you got me? Huh? Fuck you. I don't know what pain is. Fear? Don't know that either. There's nothing you can get from me. So... You already lost. Got that?
Kyung-chul: The way I see it, I think you're damn unlucky.
Kim Soo-hyeon: Don't act so weak... this is just the beginning. Remember... your nightmare's only getting worse!
Joo-yeon: Can you please not kill me?
Kyung-chul: Why do you look like you stepped in shit? -
Kyung-chul: So, how does it feel? You shouldn't have chased me. Who do you think won, you or me?
Kyung-chul: I ain't your son.
Kim Soo-hyeon: I wish you suffer even after you die.
Kim Soo-hyeon: Forgive me Ju-yeon. I wasn't there for you, always late. And never there for you. But... I promise you this. I'll make him pay for... your pain.
Kim Soo-hyeon: Wait! Stay here, he'll need to be treated!
Kim Soo-hyeon: Close your eyes. Look away and plug your ears.
Kyung-chul: Why you little... Gone insane from eating human flesh? Wake up! I'm Jang Kyung Chul!
Kyung-chul: Should keep in close range while tracking me!
Section Chief Oh: He can't be a monster to kill another monster. You know that's wrong.
Kyung-chul: I'll live no matter what!
Kim Soo-hyeon: Come on! I'm just getting started.
Kim Soo-hyeon: Sorry. I have nothing to say to you.
Kim Soo-hyeon: Hands, feet and head... just like you did. Nothing more, nothing less. You stupid sick psychos!
Kim Soo-hyeon: Are you scared? Say it, are you scared? Now do you realize what you've done?
Kim Soo-hyeon: Heard that many times, haven't you? People begging for their lives. And you enjoyed that, huh?
Kyung-chul: What? You're alone? Are you a cop?
Kyung-chul: Must be right.
Kyung-chul: The cops found me this quick?
Kim Soo-hyeon: You're shitting me.
Kyung-chul: Guess you don't know who you're dealing with.
Kyung-chul: Damn cops.
Kyung-chul: What else do you expect?
Kyung-chul: Anyways...
Tae-joo: I was wondering about you. You don't look like a monster.
Kim Soo-hyeon: Crazy a****le.
