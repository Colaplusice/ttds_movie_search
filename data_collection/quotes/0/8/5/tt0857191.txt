Prof. Walter Vale: We are not helpless children!
Mouna Khalil: It's just like Syria.
Ronald Cole: Sir?
Prof. Walter Vale: Yes? Did you find him?
Ronald Cole: He's been removed.
Prof. Walter Vale: Removed to where?
Ronald Cole: Deported.
Prof. Walter Vale: Deported? When?
Ronald Cole: He was deported this morning.
Prof. Walter Vale: How can that be? No, he - Um, sir, is there any way that I could contact him?
Ronald Cole: I don't think so.
Prof. Walter Vale: You don't think so? What kind of an answer is that?
Ronald Cole: I'm sorry, sir. That's all the information that I have. Now, please step away from the window. You can contact I.C.E. if you have any further questions. The number's on the wall. Sir? Step away from the window, please. Sir. For the last time, step away... from the window.
Prof. Walter Vale: You can't just take people away like that. Do you hear me? He was a good man, a good person. It's not fair! We are not just helpless children! He had a life! Do you hear me? I mean, do YOU hear ME? What's the matter with you?
Mouna Khalil: This feels like Syria.
Tarek Khalil: Oh shit! We have to get home! Zainab's gonna kill me, I'm on Arab time again.
Prof. Walter Vale: What is "Arab time"?
Tarek Khalil: It means I'm late by an hour. All Arabs are late by an hour, it's genetic, we can't help it.
Zainab: Are you okay?
Prof. Walter Vale: Yes, Tarek has been giving me drum lessons and I was just practising.
Prof. Walter Vale: Don't worry I'll keep my pants on.
Zainab: Why did you invite him?
Tarek Khalil: We're staying in his apartment. What could I do?
Zainab: And I'll be stuck with him while you play your drum.
Tarek Khalil: You know you're very sexy when you're mad at me.
Prof. Walter Vale: Hello! If you don't mind, I think I will come.
Tarek Khalil: Cool.
Prof. Walter Vale: Let me get my coat.
Prof. Walter Vale: I've been teaching the same course for 20 years, and it doesn't mean anything to me. None of it does. I pretend. I pretend that I'm busy, that I'm working, that I'm writing. I'm not doing anything.
