Shuya: You know a lot about medicine.
Shougo Kawada: Well, my father was a doctor.
Noriko Nakagawa: Wow! This is pretty good!
Shougo Kawada: It should be. My father was a chef.
Shuya: You even know how to drive a boat?
Shougo Kawada: Hey, my father was a fisherman.
Mitsuko: You just have to fight for yourself; no one's going to save you. That's just life, right?
Teacher Kitano: Life is a game. So fight for survival and see if you're worth it.
Kayoko Kotohiki - Girls #8: You never said a thing!... What am I supposed to do now?
Mitsuko: You die with him.
Kyouichi Motobuchi: If I survive, can I go home?
Teacher Kitano: Yes, but only if everyone else is dead.
Mitsuko: What's wrong with killing? Everyone's got their reasons.
Teacher Kitano: So today's lesson is, you kill each other off till there's only one left. Nothing's against the rules.
Mitsuko: I just didn't want to be a loser anymore.
Shuya: No matter how far, run for all you're worth. RUN.
Niida: I'm in love with you, for real, from before.
Chigusa: Wow, great. Wash your face and try again, if you survive.
Niida: Wait, you're a virgin, right?
Chigusa: Piss... me... off. God, did I just hear this idiot right?
Shougo Kawada: Meeting you guys, I finally solved the riddle of Keiko's smile.
Noriko Nakagawa: What's the answer?
Shougo Kawada: Her parting words - Thank you - and then...
Shuya: And then?
Shuya: Kawada!
Noriko Nakagawa: Kawada!
Shougo Kawada: And then - I'm glad I found true friends.
Chigusa: God, can I tell him one more thing? You look really cool, Hiroki...
Hiroki Sugimura: You too. You're the coolest girl in the world.
Mitsuko: Die, ugly.
Shougo Kawada: There's a way out of this game. Kill yourselves together, here, now. If you can't do that, then don't trust anyone... just run.
Hiroki Sugimura: You're so cute.
Yukie Utsumi: What idiots. We might have all survived. We're all so stupid. *Stupid!*
Shougo Kawada: You OK?
Noriko Nakagawa: I had a dream...
Shougo Kawada: What dream?
Noriko Nakagawa: I was alone with Kitano on an empty riverbank.
Shougo Kawada: Must've been scary.
Noriko Nakagawa: But Kitano just seemed lonely.
Shougo Kawada: Hmmm.
Noriko Nakagawa: Before this, I always just thought of myself as normal. I'd have a normal marriage, age normally, just like my mom... but when this game started, I realized - it's just that I was sheltered.
Shougo Kawada: Some things are better not to know.
Teacher Kitano: The last one... Cookies sure were good.
Chigusa: Come at me. Every inch of me will resist you.
Noriko Nakagawa: Mitsuko.
Mitsuko: What's up?
Noriko Nakagawa: I'm looking for Nanahara.
Mitsuko: Got separated?
Shougo Kawada: Noriko! Where are you?
Mitsuko: Who's that?
Noriko Nakagawa: Kawada.
Mitsuko: Eh? Two princes protecting you. A real princess.
Noriko Nakagawa: Mitsuko...
Mitsuko: Die, ugly bitch.
Hirono: You always pissed me off! I'll kill you!
Teacher Kitano: Are my classes boring?
Noriko Nakagawa: Yes.
Teacher Kitano: How dare you!
Noriko Nakagawa: Teacher Kitano: I go into class, you guys look like a pile of potatoes. Slapping them around helped me tell them apart, even got to like them. But now, not anymore. Now you touch a student, you're fired. Can't even lose it when a student stabs you!
Noriko Nakagawa: I'll tell you just one thing.
Teacher Kitano: What?
Noriko Nakagawa: That knife that stabbed you... actually I keep it in my desk at home. When I picked it up, I wasn't sure... but now, for some reason, I really treasure it. It's our secret, okay? Just between us.
Teacher Kitano: Listen, Nakagawa.
Noriko Nakagawa: Yes?
Teacher Kitano: What do you think a grown-up should say to a kid now?
Shuya: I am weak, and useless.
Shuya: But I'll stay by your side.
Shuya: I'll protect you.
Mitsuko: I've had it! Why does everybody always gang up on me? What did I do?
Hirono: Think about what you did.
Shuya: How should I know? I don't know what any of it means!
Teacher Kitano: Here's your list of friends in the order they died.
Training Video Girl: We have randomly selected weapons to put in your kits, so you might get lucky, and you might not.

Mitsuko: That doesn't prove anythi...
Hirono: Cut the crap, murderer! Fucking all the boys, but had to steal mine! You were pimping Yoshimi! Probably hung 'em both!
