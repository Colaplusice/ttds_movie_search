Zeniba: Once you do something, you never forget. Even if you can't remember.
Lin: What's going on here?
Kamaji: Something you wouldn't recognize. It's called love.
Chihiro: You don't remember your name?
Haku: No, but for some reason I remember yours.
Zeniba: Now, try to remember as much as you can about your old life.
Chihiro: For some reason, I can remember Haku... from a long time ago... but I thought I never met him before!
Zeniba: Oh, that's a wonderful place to start! Once you meet someone, you never really forget them.
Chihiro: Listen, Haku. I don't remember it, but my mom told me... Once, when I was little, I fell into a river. She said they'd drained it and built things on top. But I've just remembered. The river was called... Its name was the Kohaku River. Your real name is Kohaku.
Haku: Chihiro, thank you. My real name is Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.
Chihiro: Nigihayami?
Haku: Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.
Chihiro: What a name. Sounds like a god.
Haku: I remember too, how you fell into me as a child. You had dropped your shoe.
Chihiro: Yes, you carried me to shallow water, Kohaku.
Chihiro: I'm so grateful!
Chihiro's Father: A new home and a new school? It is a bit scary.
Chihiro: I think I can handle it.
Chihiro: I promise I'll be back, Haku. You can't die.
Lin: What's going on here?
Kamajii: Don't you see? It's called... Love.
Haku: Kamaji.
Kamajii: Oh, Haku, you're awake.
Haku: Where's Sen? What happened? Please, tell me.
Kamajii: Don't you remember anything?
Haku: Just little pieces. Chihiro kept calling my name in the darkness. I followed her voice and woke up lying here.
Kamajii: Chihiro, huh? Her real name's Chihiro? Can't beat the power of love.
Chihiro: Granny... I just want you to know my real name! It's Chihiro!
Zeniba: Oh, what a pretty name! Be sure to take good care of it, dear!
Zeniba: The protective seal on my gold charm is gone!
Chihiro: You mean that little black slug? I think I killed in when I stepped on it...
Zeniba: HA HA HA! My sister put that there so she could control Haku... and you killed it! HA HA HA! But it's strange... only love can remove a seal.
Chihiro: Guys, don't take that food! We're gonna get in trouble!
Chihiro's Father: Don't worry, you've got Daddy with you. He's got credit cards and cash!
Chihiro: Haku, listen. I just remembered something from a long time ago, I think it may help you. Once, when I was little, I dropped my shoe into a river. When I tried to get it back I fell in. I thought I'd drown but the water carried me to shore. It finally came back to me. The river's name was the Kohaku river. I think that was you, and your real name is Kohaku River.
Haku: You did it, Chihiro! I remember! I was the spirit of the Kohaku River.
Chihiro: A river spirit?
Haku: My name is the Kohaku River.
Chihiro: They filled in that river, it's all apartments now.
Haku: That must be why I can't find my way home, Chihiro, I remember you falling into the river, and I remember your little pink shoe.
Chihiro: So, you're the one who carried me back to shallow water, you saved me... I knew you were good!
Chihiro: I finally get a bouquet and it's a goodbye present. That's depressing.
Chihiro: Daddy, are we lost?
Chihiro's Father: Don't worry, I've got four-wheel drive.
Chihiro: How did you know my name was Chihiro?
Haku: I have known you since you were very small.
Yubaba: Oh, my baby! Are you all right? Are you emotionally tramautized?
Zeniba: There. Your body matches your brain.
Zeniba: We're identical twins and exact opposites.
Aogaeru: Welcome the rich man, he's hard for you to miss. His butt keeps getting bigger, so there's plenty there to kiss!
Chihiro: There must be some mistake! None of these pigs are my parents!
Haku: Don't be afraid, I just wanna help you.
Chihiro: No... no... no... no... no...
Haku: Open your mouth and eat this. If you don't eat food from this world, you'll disappear.
Zeniba: It will protect you. It's made from the threads your friends wove together.
No-Face: Try this. It's delicious. Want some gold? I'm not giving it to anybody else!
No-Face: Come closer, Sen. What would you like? Just name it.
Chihiro: I would like to leave, sir; there's some place I need to go to right away, please. You should go back to where you came from. Yubaba doesn't want you in the bath house any longer. Where is your home? Don't you have any friends or family?
No-Face: No... no... I'm lonely... I'm lonely.
Chihiro: What is it that you want?
No-Face: I want Sen... I want Sen...
No-Face: Take the gold! Take it!
Chihiro: Are you going to eat me?
No-Face: Take it!
No-Face: Huh? Ow.
Chihiro: If you want to eat me, eat this first. I was going to save it for my parents, but I think you'd better have it.
No-Face: ...Sen! Sen, what did you do to me?
Lin: Sen! I'm sorry I called you a dope before... I take it back!
Zeniba: I'm sorry my sister turned you parents into pigs, but there's nothing I can do. Its just the way things are. You'll have to help your parents and Haku by yourself. Use what you remember about them.
Chihiro: What? Can't you please give me more help than that? It feels like I met Haku, but it was a long time ago...
Zeniba: That's a good start! Once you've met someone you never really forget them. It just takes a while for your memories to return.
No-Face: Hey, boss! It's me! I'm hungry! Why don't you wake everyone up?
Lin: A human! You're in trouble! You're the one everyone's been looking for!
Kamaji: She's my granddaughter.
Lin: *Grand-daughter?*
Zeniba: I'd like to help you, dear, but there's nothing I can do. It's one of our rules here. You've got to take care of your parents and that dragon boyfriend of yours, on your own.
Chihiro: But, um, can't you even give me a hint? I feel like Haku and I met, a long time ago.
Zeniba: In that case, it's easy. Nothing that happens is ever forgotten, even if you can't remember it.
Aogaeru: What an esophagus!
Chihiro's Father: Look, Chihiro! There's your new school!
Chihiro's Mother: It doesn't look so bad.
Chihiro: It's gonna stink. I liked my old school.
Chihiro: What are all those stones? They look like little houses.
Chihiro's Mother: Those are shrines. Some people believe spirits live in them.
Chihiro: I'll miss you, Chihiro. Your best friend, Rumi.
Chihiro: I'm see-through!
Chihiro: Where is Haku... You better get here before I forget what my parents look like. I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.
Lin: You want to lose your nose?
Door Knocker: Aren't you even going to knock? You're the most pathetic little girl I've ever seen.
Zeniba: Where did you learn how to spin, No-Face?
Boh: I'm not afraid of germs. If you don't play with me, I'll cry.
Chihiro: Please don't cry, just wait!
Boh: Right now, or I'll start crying!
Chihiro: Don't cry! Don't cry!
Chihiro: He's following us.
Lin: Just don't look at him.
Chihiro's Father: Everybody, watch your step.
Chihiro's Mother: Chihiro, don't cling like that. You'll make me trip.
Frog Spirit: Lin...
Lin: What?
Frog Spirit: I smell something... a human! You smell like a human!
Lin: Oh, really.
Frog Spirit: You're hiding something, Lin. Come on, spit it out.
Lin: Is this what you smell?
Frog Spirit: Roasted newt!
Lin: Sen! Sen, where are you?
Chihiro: Over here!
Lin: Don't worry... stay right where you are, I'm coming to get you! You're gonna be fine, I won't let him hurt you.
Chihiro: I think he needs help! It feels like there's a thorn in his side!
Yubaba: What did you do with my baby?
Zeniba: Oh, paper cut!
