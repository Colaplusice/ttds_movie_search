Anno Tanaka: Since there's no superiority or inferiority in Wushu, why still have competition?
Huo Yuan Jia: I believe that there's no superiority or inferiority in Wushu. Just the distinction of practitioners with different levels of ability. Through the competition we can discover this and meet the true self. Because indeed the antagonist is namely ourself. Only through competition, can one recognise one's true self.
Huo Yuan Jia: Poison works very quickly. It has worked its way to my heart... Zhensheng, promise me you won't seek revenge. Revenge will only bring us more bloodshed. Please, that's not what I want. We must strive to become triumphant... Nong Jinsun, I only understand wushu. I practiced for many years to understand what Wushu is, what is wushu's real purpose. The competition must continue. One cannot choose how one's life begins. It takes courage to finish the final step.
Huo Yuan Jia: Pussy claw?
Zhao Jian: It's Tiger Claw!
Moon: because, "If you're sad", my Grandma told me "then cry", "After you cry, you still have to live life"
