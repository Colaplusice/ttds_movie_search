Dwayne: You know what? Fuck beauty contests. Life is one fucking beauty contest after another. School, then college, then work... Fuck that. And fuck the Air Force Academy. If I want to fly, I'll find a way to fly. You do what you love, and fuck the rest.
Grandpa: A real loser is someone who's so afraid of not winning he doesn't even try.
Dwayne: I wish I could just sleep until I was eighteen and skip all this crap-high school and everything-just skip it.
Frank: Do you know who Marcel Proust is?
Dwayne: He's the guy you teach.
Frank: Yeah. French writer. Total loser. Never had a real job. Unrequited love affairs. Gay. Spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads. But he's also probably the greatest writer since Shakespeare. Anyway, he uh... he gets down to the end of his life, and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered, Those were the best years of his life, 'cause they made him who he was. All those years he was happy? You know, total waste. Didn't learn a thing. So, if you sleep until you're 18... Ah, think of the suffering you're gonna miss. I mean high school? High school-those are your prime suffering years. You don't get better suffering than that.
Olive: I'd like to dedicate this to my grandpa, who showed me these moves.
Pageant MC: Aww, that is so sweet.
Pageant MC: Is he here? Where's your grandpa right now?
Olive: In the trunk of our car.
Dwayne: You know what? Fuck beauty contests. Life is one fucking beauty contest after another. You know, school, then college, then work, fuck that. And fuck the air force academy. If I wanna fly, I'll find a way to fly. You do what you love, and fuck the rest.
Frank: I'm glad you're talking again, Dwayne. You're not nearly as stupid as you look.
Dwayne: Go Hug Mom
Olive: Do you think there's a Heaven?
Frank: Well, it's hard to say, Olive. I don't think anyone knows for sure.
Olive: I know, but what do *you* think?
Frank: Well... um... uh...
Olive: I think there is.
Frank: Think I'll get in?
Olive: Yeah.
Frank: Promise?
Olive: Yeah.
Richard: Sarcasm is the refuge of losers.
Frank: It is? Really?
Richard: Sarcasm is losers trying to bring winners down to their level.
Frank: Wow, Richard, you've really opened my eyes to what a loser I am. How much do I owe you for those pearls of wisdom?
Richard: Oh, that ones on the house.
Sheryl: I'm so glad you're still here.
Frank: Well, that makes one of us.
Olive: Grandpa, am I pretty?
Grandpa: You are the most beautiful girl in the world.
Olive: You're just saying that.
Grandpa: No! I'm madly in love with you and it's not because of your brains or your personality.
Richard: Oh my God, I'm getting pulled over. Everyone, just... pretend to be normal.
Olive: Do you eat ice cream?
Miss California: Yes. My favorite is Chocolate Cherry Garcia... except technically I think it's a frozen yogurt.
Olive: Why were you unhappy?
Frank: I fell in love with someone...
Frank: ...who didn't love me back.
Olive: Who?
Frank: One of my grad students. I was very much in love with him.
Olive: *Him*? You fell in love with a boy?
Frank: Very much so.
Olive: That's silly.
Frank: You're right it was silly. It was very silly
Grandpa: That's another word for it.
Grandpa: Jesus, I'm tired. I'm so fucking tired. You know how tired I am? If a girl came up to me and begged me to fuck her, I couldn't do it. That's how tired I am.
Grandpa: Are you gettin' any?
Richard: Dad!
Grandpa: You can tell me, Dwayne. Are you gettin' any?
Richard: Come on, please.
Grandpa: No? Jesus. You're what? Fifteen? My God, man!
Richard: Dad!
Grandpa: You should be gettin' that young stuff.
Richard: Dad!
Grandpa: That young stuff is the best stuff in the whole world.
Richard: Hey! Hey! Dad! That's enough! Stop it!
Grandpa: Will you kindly not interrupt me, Richard! See, right now you're jailbait, they're jailbait. It's perfect. I mean, you hit 18, man! You're talkin' about three to five.
Frank: So who do you hang around with?
Dwayne: Frank: No one?
Dwayne: Frank: What about your family?
Dwayne: Grandpa: Fuck a lotta women, kid, I have no reason to lie to you. Not just one, a lotta women.
Richard: Okay, dad, I think we get it.
Grandpa: Are you getting it? Is it going in anywhere? No, don't show me the pad. I don't wanna see the fucking pad.
Richard: There's two kinds of people in this world, there's winners and there's losers. Okay, you know what the difference is? Winners don't give up.
Grandpa: Every night it's the fucking chicken! Holy God Almighty! Is it possible just once we could get something to eat for dinner around here that's not the goddamned fucking chicken?
Sheryl: What did he say?
Richard: I'll tell you when I regain consciousness.
Frank: I am going to get something to drink. You want anything?
Grandpa: Yeah, get me some porn. Get me something really nasty too, I don't want any of that airbrushed shit.
Frank: Okay.
Grandpa: Okay, here's a $20. Get yourself a little treat too, get yourself a fag rag.
Frank: All right, I will.
Frank: Good night Dwayne.
Dwayne: Don't kill yourself tonight.
Frank: Not on your watch Dwayne. I wouldn't do that to you.
Dwayne: Welcome to hell.
Frank: Thanks Dwayne. Coming from you that means a lot.
Sheryl: You know, like it or not, we're still your family, for better or worse...
Dwayne: No, you're *not* my family! I don't wanna *be* your family! I hate you fucking people! Divorce? Bankrupt? Suicide? You're fucking losers, you're losers! No, please just leave me here, Mom. Please, please, please. Please... just leave me here.
Frank: "Where's Olive?"...
Sheryl: Oh!
Officer Martinez: Okay, you're out. On the condition that you never enter your daughter in a beauty pageant in the state of California, ever again. Ever.
Frank: I think we can live with that.
Sheryl: He started snorting heroin.
Frank: You started snorting heroin?
Grandpa: Let me tell ya, don't do that stuff. When you're young, you're crazy to do that shit.
Frank: Well what about you?
Grandpa: What about me? I'm old. When you're old you're crazy not to do it.
Frank: Who is that? Nietzsche? So you stopped talking because of Friedrich Nietzsche? Far out.
Richard: Hey, I will pull this truck over, right now!
Grandpa: So, pull the truck over! You're not gonna shut me up! FUCK YOU! I can say what I want!
Frank: No one gets left behind! No one gets left behind! Outstanding soldier!
Frank: Outstanding!
Frank: You can't fly jets if you're colourblind.
Dwayne: *FUCK!*
Sheryl: What happened?
Frank: He's colourblind. He can't fly.
Sheryl: Oh, Jesus... oh, no.
Sheryl: Dwayne...? Dwayne, honey, I'm sorry. Dwayne, come on. We have to go.
Dwayne: I'm not going.
Sheryl: Dwayne...
Dwayne: I said *I'm not*, okay? I don't care, I'm not getting on that bus again.
Sheryl: Dwayne, for better or worse, we're your family...
Dwayne: No, you're *not* my family, okay? I don't want to *be* your family! I *hate* you fucking people! *I hate you!* Divorce? Bankrupt? Suicide? You're fucking *losers*! You are losers!
Sheryl: Dwayne...
Dwayne: No, *please* just leave me here, Mom. Okay? Please, *please*. Please just leave me here.
Pageant Official Jenkins: What is your daughter doing?
Richard: She's kickin' ass... that's what she's doing.
Dwayne: FUUUUUUCK!
Olive: What are you guys talking about?
Grandpa: Politics.
Richard: Everybody just pretend to be normal.
Pageant Assistant Pam: Are you authorized to be here?
Dwayne: No.
Dwayne: Where are the dressing rooms?
Girl in Hallway: Are you allowed to be here?
Dwayne: Just tell me where the dressing rooms are!
Olive: Mom? Dad?
Richard: What is it, hon?
Olive: Grandpa won't wake up.
Grandpa: Losers are people who are so afraid of not winning, they don't even try.
Frank: He fell in love with another man,a colleague of mine; Larry Sugarman.
Sheryl: Who's Larry Sugarman?
Frank: Probably the second highest regarded Proust scholar in th US.
Richard: Who's number 1?
Frank: That would be me Rich.
Richard: Really?
Grandpa: Again with the fucking chicken.
Richard: Dad.
Grandpa: It's always with the goddamn fucking chicken.
Grandpa: Listen to me, I got no reason to lie to you, don't make the same mistakes I made when I was young. Fuck a lotta women kid, not just one woman, a lotta women.
Frank: Have I mentioned that I am the preeminent Proust scholar in the US?
Richard: It's this Sunday? Why can't Jeff and Cindy take her?
Sheryl: They have some equestrian thing in Santa Barbara.
Richard: You know, they do that horse shit every-single-weekend.
Sheryl: Well, it's the nationals. They're taking both horses, so apparently it's a big deal.
Frank: But. I. Am. Not. Going. To. Have. Any. Fun.
Frank: Yeah, we're all with ya on that one, Dwayne.
Frank: Did you know that "a la mode", in French, translates literally to "in the fashion"? A la moooode... It comes from the latin word modus to do or proper measure.
Richard: Frank shut up.
Dwayne: I apologize for the things I said. I was upset, and I didn't really mean them.
Olive: Mom, Dwayne's got 20/20 vision!
Sheryl: I bet he does...
Olive: Now, let's see if you're colorblind.
Olive: What's the letter in the circle?
Olive: No in the circle. The letter... in the circle?
Frank: Can you see a letter, Dwayne?
Olive: It's an A. See? Right there?
Frank: It's bright green.
Frank: Oh man.
Frank: Dwayne, I think you might be colorblind.
Frank: You can't fly jets if you're colorblind.
Frank: Where are they? I will *kill* those little fuckers!
Richard: There are two kinds of people in this world, winners and losers.
Frank: I take it you didn't like it at Sunset Manor?
Sheryl: Frank...
Grandpa: Are you kidding me? It was a fucking paradise. They got pool... They got golf... Now I'm stuck with Mr. Happy here, sleeping on a fucking sofa. Look, I know you are a homo and all, but maybe you can appreciate this. You go to one of those places, there's four women for every guy. Can you imagine what that's like?
Frank: You must have been very busy.
Grandpa: Ho oh. I had second degree burns on my johnson, I kid you not.
Frank: Really?
Grandpa: Forget about it.
Richard: Sweet sweetness!
Grandpa: Olive, Richard is an idiot. I like a woman with meat on her bones.
Pageant Assistant Pam: Are you authorized to be backstage?
Dwayne: No.
Richard: We were driving for five or six hours... and we thought he was napping...
Frank: I couldn't help noticing Dwayne has stopped speaking.
Sheryl: Oh, yeah, he's taken a vow of silence.
Grandpa: Dwayne? That's your name, right?
Grandpa: Get yourself a fag rag.
Kirby: Your packet has tickets in it, and there's your badge number.
Richard: Okay.
Kirby: Is there anything else?
Richard: Uh, yeah. Is there a funeral home around here?
Richard: You know, Olive, Grandpa would have been proud of you today.
Olive: Really?
Sheryl: You were great.
Frank: You were better than great.
Dwayne: You were incredible.
Frank: Is he always like this? How can you stand it?
Richard: It's stuck or something.
Sheryl: Try pulling it from here.
Richard: I can't slow down. I can't slow down.
Sheryl: Come on, Olive.
Frank: Come on, sweetie, jump. Jump in the car.
Olive: Can I get the, uh, waffles? And, um, what does "a la mode-y" mean?
Diner Waitress: Oh that means it comes with ice cream!
Olive: Ok. A la mode-y then.
Olive: What are you guys talking about?
Grandpa: Politics.
Olive: Oh.
Pageant Official Jenkins: What in the world?
Richard: We're going to California.
