Louison: Nobody is entirely evil: it's that circumstances that make them evil, or they don't know they are doing evil.
Louison: One must always forgive.
Julie Clapet: Depends. It's not always possible.
Louison: Don't say that. No one is entirely evil. It's circumstance. Or they don't realize the wrong.
Julie Clapet: I'm blind as a bat. Everything's all foggy.
Louison: I could get lost in that fog.
Louison: Dr Livingstone... He was my partner.
Julie Clapet: Where is he now?
Louison: He disappeared one night, after a show. We only found his remains... They ate him! Can you believe that? They ate him!
Aurore Interligator: They talk to me about you.
Robert Kube: Who?
Aurore Interligator: The voices in my head.
Robert Kube: Of course, the voices. What do they say?
Aurore Interligator: Let me think... They speak in such a way...
Robert Kube: Do they speak... About love?
Aurore Interligator: They tell me Robert is a pervert, an ass-wipe, a panty-eater.
Robert Kube: No, but you know that's not true?
