Narrator: Man... probably the most mysterious species on our planet. A mystery of unanswered questions. Who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going? How do we know what we think we know? Why do we believe anything at all? Countless questions in search of an answer... an answer that will give rise to a new question... and the next answer will give rise to the next question and so on. But, in the end, isn't it always the same question? And always the same answer?
Herr Schuster: The ball is round, a game lasts 90 minutes, everything else is pure theory. Off we go!
Manni: What if I were in a coma, and the doc says, "One more day?"
Lola: I'd throw you into the ocean... Shock therapy.
Manni: What happened to you? Did you run here?
Manni: What's in the bag?
Lola: Manni - you're not dead yet.
Manni: I'm not?
Herr Schuster: Are you here at last, honey?
Lola: Who's that slut?
Herr Meier: Is everything all right?
Lola: No.
Manni: Help me, Lola! I don't know what to do!
Vater: To think that I could have fathered a loon like you!
Lola: But you did, you jerk!
Vater: Oh, yeah? Your real father didn't even live to see your birth!
