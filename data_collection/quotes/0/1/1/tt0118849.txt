Ali: Zahra, I have good news.
Zahra: What news?
Ali: I am selected for the race.
Zahra: What race?
Ali: Long-Distance Running. The third-best runner gets a pair of new sneakers.
Zahra: Why the third?
Ali: The First and Second prizes are something else. If I come in third, I'll give you the sneakers.
Zahra: But those shoes are for boys.
Ali: I'll exchange them. I'll get a pair of girl's shoes for you.
Zahra: What if you don't come in third?
Ali: I'll be third for sure.
