Sulley: Boo?
Boo: Kitty!
Mike: Can I borrow your odorant?
Sulley: Yeah, I got, uh, Smelly Garbage or Old Dumpster.
Mike: You got, uh, Low Tide?
Sulley: No.
Mike: How about Wet Dog?
Sulley: Yep. Stink it up.
Sulley: I can still hear her little voice.
Boo: Mike Wazowski!
Mike: Hey, I can hear her too.
Kids: Mike Wazowski!
Mike: How many kids you got in there?
Sulley: Mike?
Mike: Look, it's not that I don't care about the kid.
Sulley: Mike, you don't understand.
Mike: Yes, I do. I was just mad, that's all. I needed some time to think, but you shouldn't have left me out there.
Sulley: I'm being attacked!
Mike: No, I'm not attacking you. I'm trying to be honest, just hear me out. You and I are a team. Nothing is more important than our friendship.
Mike: I-I know, kid. He's too sensitive.
Mike: Come on, pal. If you start crying, I'm gonna cry, and I'll never get through this. I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, but I am now. Hey, Sulley, I am baring my soul here. The least you can do is pay attention!
Mike: Hey, look at that, it's Randall. It's... Oh.
Randall: Cheating? Right. Okay, I think I know how to make this all go away. What happens when the whistle blows in five minutes?
Mike: Ah, I get a time-out?
Randall: Everyone goes to lunch! Which means: the scare floor will be...?
Mike: ...Painted?
Randall: EMPTY! It'll be empty, you idiot! You see that clock? When the big hand is pointing up...
Randall: and the little hand is pointing up...
Randall: the kid's door will be in my station. But when the big hand points down...
Randall: the door will be gone. You have until then to put the kid back. Get the picture?
Mike: Good morning, Roz, my succulent little garden snail. And who will we be scaring today?
Roz: Wazowski! You didn't file your paperwork last night.
Mike: Oh, that darn paperwork! Wouldn't it be easier if it all just blew away?
Roz: Don't let it happen again.
Mike: Yes, well, I'll try to be more careful next time.
Roz: I'm watching you, Wazowski. Always watching. Always.
Mike: Ooh, she's nuts.
Charlie: Twenty-three nineteen! We have a Twenty-three nineteen!
Randall: Wazowski! Where is it, you little one-eyed cretin?
Mike: Okay, first of all, it's "creetin". If you're gonna threaten me, do it properly. Second of all, you're nuts if you think kidnapping ME is gonna help YOU cheat your way to the top.
Randall: You still think this is about that stupid scare record?
Mike: Well... I did. Right up until you... chuckled... like that... And now I'm thinking I should just get out of here.
Randall: I am about to revolutionize the scaring industry, and when I do, even the great James P. Sullivan will be working of me. First I need to know where the kid is, and you're gonna tell me.
Mike: I can't believe it...
Sulley: Oh, Mike...
Mike: I was on TV. Ha. Did you see me? I'm a natural.
Mike: Roz, my tender, oozing blossom, you're looking fabulous today. Is that a new haircut? Come on, tell me it's a new haircut, isn't it? It's got to be a new haircut. New makeup? You had a lift? You had a tuck? You had something? Something has been inserted in in you that makes you look... Listen, I need a favor. Randall was working late last night out on the scare floor. I really need the key to the door he was using.
Roz: Well, isn't that nice? But guess what? You didn't turn in your paperwork last night.
Mike: He didn't... I... no paperwork?
Roz: This office is now closed.
Mike: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Sulley: Hey, Mike, this might sound crazy but I don't think that kid's dangerous.
Mike: Really? Well, in that case, let's keep it. I always wanted a pet that could kill me.
Sulley: Mike, that's not her door.
Mike: What are you talking about? Of course it's her door. It's her door.
Sulley: No. Her door was white and it had flowers on it.
Mike: No. It must've dark last night because this is its door.
Mike: You hear that? Sounds like fun in there. Well, see ya kid. Send me a postcard. That's Mike Wazowski, care of 22 Mike Wazowsi-You-Got-Your-Life-Back-Lane.
Boo: Mowki Kowski.
Mike: Very good. Now bon voyage. See ya.
Mike: Look at the stick. See the stick?
Mike: Go get the stick. Go fetch.
Celia: Oh, Michael, I've had a lot of birthdays - well, not a lot of birthdays but this is the best birthday ever.
Celia: What are you looking at?
Mike: I was just thinking about the first time I laid eye on you, how pretty you looked.
Celia: Stop it.
Mike: Your hair was shorter then.
Celia: Mm-hmm. I'm thinking about getting it cut.
Mike: No-no, I like it this length.
Mike: I like everything about you. Just the other day someone asked me who I thought the most beautiful was in all of Monstropolis. You know what I said?
Celia: What did you say?
Mike: I said...
Mike: Sulley?
Celia: Sulley?
Henry J. Waternoose: This has gone far enough, James.
Sulley: She's home now. Just leave her alone!
Henry J. Waternoose: I can't do that, James. She's seen too much. You both have.
Sulley: It doesn't have to be this way.
Henry J. Waternoose: I have no choice. Times have changed. Scaring isn't enough anymore.
Sulley: But kidnapping children?
Henry J. Waternoose: I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die, and I'll silence anyone who gets in my way!
Voice: Simulation terminated. Simulation terminated...
Henry J. Waternoose: Huh? But... What?
Mike: I don't know about you guys, but I spotted several big mistakes. You know what? Let's watch my favorite part again, shall we?
Sulley: How can I do this? How could I be so stupid? This could ruin the company.
Mike: The company? Who cares about the company? What about us? That thing is a KILLING MACHINE!
Mike: I bet it's waiting for us to fall asleep, and then - bam! Oh, we're easy prey, my friend. Easy prey! We're sitting targets!
Sulley: Hey, that looks like Randall. Randall's your monster. You think he's gonna come out of the closet and scare you?
Sulley: Look, it's empty. No monster in here. Okay, NOW there is. I'm not gonna scare you. I'm off duty.
Mike: Psst, Fungus. Fungus, you like cars? Because I got a really nice car. You let me go, I'll give you... a ride... in the car.
Fungus: I'm sorry, Wazowski, but Randall said I'm not allowed to fraternize with victims of his evil plot.
Randall: What are you doing? Where's Wazowski?
Mike: What is that thing? What is that thing? Hey, hey, hey, that thing is moving. I don't like big, moving things that are moving towards me.
Randall: Say hello to the Scream Extractor.
Mike: Hello. Hey, where are you going? C'mon, we'll talk! We'll have a latte!
Flint: All right, Mr. Bile, is it?
Bile: Uh, my friends call me Phlem.
Flint: Uh-huh, Mr. Bile, can you tell me what you did wrong?
Bile: I fell down?
Flint: No, No, before that.
Flint: Can anyone tell me Mr. Bile's big mistake? Anyone?
Flint: Alright let's check footage, right there. The Door! And leaving the door open is the worst mistake that any employee could make, because...
Bile: Uh... it could let in a draft?
Henry J. Waternoose: It could let in a child.
Sulley: Hey, Ted! Good morning!
Sulley: See that, Mikey? Ted's walking to work.
Mike: Big deal. Guy takes five steps and he's there.
Sulley: Oh. So *that's* puce.
Sulley: Mike, this isn't Boo's door.
Mike: Boo? What's Boo?
Sulley: That's... what I decided to call her. Is there a problem?
Mike: Sulley, you're not supposed to name it. Once you name it, you start getting attached to it. Now put that thing back where it came from or so help me...
Mike: Oh, hey. We're rehearsing a - a scene for the upcoming company play called uh, Put That Thing Back Where It Came From Or So Help Me. It's a musical.
Mike: Put that thing back where it came from or so help me... so help me, so help me and cut. We're still working on it, it's a work in progress but, hey, we need ushers.
Henry J. Waternoose: Finally. I shouldn't have trusted you. Because of you, I had to banish my top scarer.
Randall: Ah, with this machine, we won't need scarers. Besides, Sullivan got what he deserved.
Henry J. Waternoose: Sullivan was twice the scarer you'll ever be!
Needleman: So I said, "If you talk to me like that again, we're through."
Smitty: Oh! What did she say?
Needleman: You know my mom. She sent me to my room.
Yeti: You wanna go to the village? Okay, rule number one out here: Always... no, Never go out in a blizzard.
Sulley: We need to get to Boo.
Mike: Boo? What about us?
Mike: Ever since that kid came in, you've ignored everything I've said, and now look where we are!
Mike: Oh, we were about to break the record, Sulley. We would've had it made!
Sulley: None of that matters now.
Mike: None of it matters?
Mike: Wa-wait a second. None of it matters? Oh, okay, that's - no. Good. Great. So now the truth comes out, doesn't it?
Yeti: Oh, would you look at that? We're out of snowcones. Let me... just go outside and make some more.
Mike: Sulley, what about everything we ever worked for? Does that matter? Huh? What about Celia? I am never... never gonna see her again. Doesn't that matter? What about me? I'm your pal, I'm-I'm your best friend. Don't I matter?
Sulley: I'm sorry, Mike. I'm sorry we're stuck out here. I didn't mean all this to happen. But Boo's in trouble. I think there might be a way to save her if we can just get down to that...
Mike: We? Whoa, whoa. We? No. There's no we this time, pal. If-if-if you wanna go out there and freeze to death, you be my guest, because you're on your own.
Boo: Mike Waszowski.
Roz: Hello, Wazowski. Fun-filled evening planned for tonight?
Mike: Well, as a matter of fact...
Roz: Then I'm sure you filed your paperwork correctly, for once.
Roz: Your stunned silence is very reassuring.
Babysitter: Well, hello there. What's your name?
Boo: Mike Wazowski.
Mike: Look at the big jerk. He ruined my life, and for what? A STUPID KID! Because of you, I am stuck in this frozen wasteland!
Yeti: Wasteland? I think you mean "Wonderland"! I mean, how about all this fabulous snow, huh? Oh, and wait until you see the local village, cutest thing in the world. I haven't mentioned all the free yak's milk.
Sulley: Wh... What did you say?
Yeti: Yak's milk. Milking a yak isn't exactly a picnic; but once you pick the hairs out, it's very nutritious.
Sulley: No, No. Something about a Village. Are there any Kids there?
Yeti: Oh, sure. Tough kids, sissy kids, kids who climb on rocks...
Sulley: Where is it?
Yeti: Bottom of the Mountain. A 3 Day hike from here.
Sulley: 3 Days? We need to get there NOW.
Mike: Oh, you should have seen the look on Waternoose's face when that wall went up. Woo-hoo! I hope we get a copy of that tape. Hey, you all right? Come on, we did it. We got Boo home. Sure, we put the company in the toilet, and, gee, hundreds of people will be out of work now, not to mention the angry mob that'll come after us when there's no more power... but hey, at least we had a few laughs, right?
Sulley: Laughs!
Yeti: Aw, poor guy. I understand. It's not easy being banished. Take my buddy Bigfoot. When he was banished he fashioned an enormous diaper out of poison ivy. Wore it on his head like a tiara. Called himself "King Itchy".
Mike: I'm telling you, Big Daddy. You're gonna be seeing this face on TV more often.
Sulley: Yeah, like on "Monstropolis' Most Wanted"?
Mike: Ha, ha, ha. You've been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade, pal.
Mike: Hey, good morning, Monstropolis. It's now five after the hour of 6:00 A.M. in the big monster city. Temperature's a balmy 65 degrees, which is good news for you reptiles, and it looks like it's gonna be a perfect day to maybe, hey, just lie in bed, sleep in, or simply... Work out that flab that's hanging over the bed! Get up, Sulley!
Sulley: I don't believe I ordered a wake-up call, Mikey.
Mike: Hey, less talk, more pain, marshmellow boy!
Henry J. Waternoose: Well hello, little one. Where did you come from?
Sulley: Mr. Waternoose.
Henry J. Waternoose: Ah, James. Is this one yours?
Sulley: Ah, actually that's my uh, cousin's sister's daughter, sir.
Mike: Yeah, it's uh, "Bring an Obscure Relative to Work Day".
Henry J. Waternoose: Hmm, must have missed the memo.
Yeti: Abominable. Can you believe that? Do I look abominable to you? Why can't they call me the Adorable Snowman, or the Agreeable Snowman, for crying out loud? I'm a nice guy. Snow cone?
Mike: Yuck.
Yeti: No, no, no, don't worry. It's lemon. How about you Big Fella? Snow cone?
Sulley: Did you see the way she looked at me?
Mike: Get out of here. You're ruining everything.
Sulley: I went back to get your paperwork and there was a door.
Mike: What? A door?
Sulley: Randall was in it.
Mike: Wait a minute, Randall? That cheater! He's trying to boost his numbers.
Sulley: There's something else.
Mike: What?
Sulley: Ook-lay in the ag-bay.
Mike: What?
Sulley: Look in the bag.
Mike: What bag?
Randall: Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Do you hear that? It's the winds of change.
Sulley: BOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Sulley: No, no! No, no, no, no, NO!
Mike: It's too late! We're banished, genius! We're in the human world! Oh, what a great idea; goin' to your old pal Waternoose! Too bad he was in on the whole thing! All you hadda do, was listen to me, just once! But you didn't, did you?
Mike: YOU'RE STILL NOT LISTENING!
Yeti: Welcome to the Himalayas.
Trailer Son: Mama! 'Nother gator got in the house!
Trailer Mom: Another gator? Gimme that shovel!
Boo: Boo!... Kitty?
Mike: Oh, that's great, blame it on the little guy. How original. He must've read the schedule wrong with his one eye.
Henry J. Waternoose: There's nothing more toxic or deadly than a human child. A single touch could kill you. Leave a door open, and one can walk right into this factory; right into the monster world.
Trainee: I won't go into a kid's room. You can't make me.
Henry J. Waternoose: You're going in there, because we need this.
Henry J. Waternoose: Our city is counting on you to collect those screams. Without scream, we have no power. Yes, it's dangerous work, and that's why I need you to be at your best. I need scarers who are confident, tenacious, tough, intimidating. I need scarers like... like... James P. Sullivan.
Celia: So, uh... are we going anywhere special tonight?
Mike: I-I just got us into a little place called, um... Harryhausen's.
Celia: Harryhausen's? But it's impossible to get a reservation there.
Mike: Not for Googlie Bear. I will see you at quitting time, and not a minute later.
Celia: Okay, sweetheart.
Mike: Think romantical thoughts.
Mike: You and me, me and you, both of us together!
Ward's Assistant: What happened?
Ward: The kid almost touched me. She got this close to me.
Ward's Assistant: She wasn't scared of you? She was only six.
Ward: I could have been dead. I could have DIED.
Ward's Assistant: Keep it together, man.
Ward's Assistant: Hey, we've get a dead door over here.
Needleman: OK, Let her rip!
Henry J. Waternoose: No, no, no, no, no. What was that? You're trying to scare the kid, not lull it to sleep.
Bile: I was going for a snake-slash-ninja approach, with a little hissing.
Henry J. Waternoose: How many times must I tell you? It's all about presence. About how you enter the room.
TV Anchorman: If witnesses are to be believed, there has been a child security breach for the first time in monster history.
CDA Agent: We can neither confirm nor deny the presence of a human child here tonight.
Witness #1: Well the kid flew right over me and blasted a car with its laser vision.
Witness #2: I tried to get away from it, but he picked me up with his mind powers and shook me like a doll.
Witness #3: It's true! I saw the whole thing!
Professor on TV: It is my professional opinion that now it's the time to *panic*!
Mike: Hey, genius. Wanna know why I bought the car?
Sulley: Not really.
Mike: To drive it! You know, like on the street? With the honk-honk and the vroom-vroom, and the no walking involved?
Sulley: Wah, wah, wah. Will you give it a rest, butterball? C'mon, you could use the exercise.
Mike: I could use the exercise? Look at you. You have your own climate.
Mike: Someone else will find the kid. I'll be their problem, not ours. She's out of our hair!
Randall: What are you two doing?
Monster: They're rehearsing a play.
Mike: She's out of our hair...!
Mike: Sir, that's not her door.
Henry J. Waternoose: I know, I know...
Henry J. Waternoose: ...It's yours.
Randall: WAZOWSKI!
Randall: Well what do you know? It scares little kids and little monsters.
Mike: I wasn't scared, I have allergies
Mike: Hello, is this thing on? Hey, good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Nice to be here in... your room. Hi, where are you from?
Mike: You're in kindergarden, right? I used to love kindergarden. Best three years of my life.
Mike: Of my life. But I love sports. Dodgeball was the best. I was the fastest one out there. Course, I was the ball. You see, I... was the ball. All right, kid.
Mike: Thank you! You've been a wonderful audience. I'll be here all week. Don't forget to tip your waitress.
Sulley: Nice job, Mikey. You filled your quota on the first kid of the day.
Mike: You know, only someone with great comedic timing could produce this much energy in one shot.
Sulley: Uh-huh, and the fact that laughter has ten times the energy of scream had nothing to do with it.
Charlie: Now, George, I know you can do this. I picked out an easy door for you, in Nepal. Nice, quiet Nepal.
George Sanderson: You know, you're right. Here, Take this.
Charlie: Go get 'em, Georgie.
Sulley: Gangway! Look out! Coming through! Sorry, George.
Charlie: Hey, you can't just...
Charlie: Twenty-three nine...!
Sulley: Hey that's my bed, you're gonna get your germs all over it.
Mike: Come on, the coast is clear. Ok, all we have to do is get rid of that thing, so wait here while I get its cardkey.
Sulley: But she can't stay here this is the men's room.
Mike: That is the weirdest thing you have ever said. Its fine, it's ok! Look, it loves it here, its dancing with joy!
Mike: I'll be right back with its door key.
Sulley: That's a cute little dance you got. Almost looks like you gotta - Oh.
Henry J. Waternoose: Kids these days. They just don't get scared like they used to.
Boo: Lookit.
Mike: 118. Do you have 119? Do I see 120? Oh, I don't believe it!
Sulley: I'm not even breaking a sweat.
Mike: Not you! Look! The new commercial's on.
CDA Agent: This is the CDA. Come out slowly with the child in plain sight.
Mike: Okay, okay! You got us. Here we are, here's the kid. I'm cooperating. But before you take us away, I have one thing to say.
Mike: Catch!
CDA Agent: 23-19!
Mike: Sulley, what are we doing?
Sulley: We have to get Boo's door and find a station.
Mike: What a plan. Simple, yet insane.
Mike: I think I have a plan here: using mainly spoons, we dig a tunnel under the city and release it into the wild.
Sulley: Spoons?
Mike: That's it, I'm out of ideas. We're closed. Hot air balloon? Too expensive. Giant slingshot? Too conspicuous. Enormous wooden horse? Too Greek.
Sulley: Hey... may the best monster win.
Randall: I plan to.
Mike: Follow the sultry sound of my voice
Mike: Why couldn't we have been banished here?
Sulley: What was that?
Mike Wazowski: I have no idea. But it would be a really good idea if it didn't do it again.
Sulley: The power's out. Make her laugh again.
Mike: All right, I got a move here, it'll bring down the house. Up!
Sulley: Oh, sorry, she didn't see that.
Mike: What? What'd you do, forget to check if her stupid hood was up, you big dope?
Sulley: Uncle Mike, try not to yell in front of her. You know we still need her to laugh.
Mike: Right. He-he! Hey, Boo! Just kidding. Look!
Mike: Funny, right? Huh? With the... These are the jokes, kid.
Sulley: Oh, he's a happy bear, and he's not crying, and neither should you, or we'll be in trouble, 'cause they're gonna find us...
Celia: Michael, if you don't tell me what's going on right now, we are through! You hear me? Through!
Mike: Okay, here's the truth. You know that kid they're looking for? Sulley let her in. We tried to get her back, but Waternoose had a secret plot, and now Randall's right behind us, and he's tring to kill us.
Celia: You expect me to believe that pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?
Boo: Mike Wazowski!
Roz: None of this ever happened, gentlemen. And I don't want to see any paperwork on it.
Mike: She's the one. I'm telling ya, she is the one.
Sulley: I'm happy for you.
Mike: Oh, by the way, thanks for hooking me up with those reservations.
Sulley: No problem. They're under the name Googlie-Bear.
Mike: Thanks, I... you know, that isn't very funny.
Mike: Come on, it slides, it slides!
Needleman: Hey, Mr. Sullivan!
Sulley: Guys, I told you, call me Sulley.
Smitty: I don't think so.
Needleman: We just wanted to wish you good luck today.
Mike: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, get lost, you two. You're making him lose his focus.
Needleman: Oh, sorry.
Sulley: See you later, fellas.
Smitty: Go get 'em, Mr. Sullivan!
Needleman: Quiet! You're making him lose his focus.
Smitty: Oh, no. Sorry!
Needleman: Shut up!
Mike: You know, I am so romantic, sometimes I think I should just marry myself.
Sulley: Give me a break, Mike.
Mike: What a night of romance I got ahead of me. Tonight it's about me and Celia. Ooh, the Love Boat is about to set sail. Toot-toot! Cause I gotta tell you, buddy, that face of hers , it just makes my heart go...
Mike: Yikes!
Sulley: Boo!
Sulley: No!
CDA Agent: Hey you!
CDA Agent: Halt! He's the one! The one's from the commercial! Affirmative. That's him. Can we get an autograph?
Sulley: Oh! Oh sure! No problem!
Randall: So, how about this kid getting loose? Crazy, huh?
Sulley: Uh, yeah, crazy.
Randall: Word on the street is the kid has been traced to the factory. Know anything about that?
Sulley: Uh, no, uh...
Mike: No, no way. But if it was an inside job, I'd put my money on Waxford.
Randall: Waxford?
Mike: Yeah, works over in sector 6, he's got those shifty eyes.
Randall: Hey, Waxford!
Sulley: Mr. Waternoose?
Henry J. Waternoose: James! You're just in time. OK Gentleman. It's time for you to see how scaring really works.
Sulley: But sir, I just wanted to ask...
Boo: Kitty!
Mike: No Boo. I wouldn't...
Henry J. Waternoose: Now, give us a a Great Big Roar.
Sulley: Sir, can I just...
Henry J. Waternoose: Roar!
Sulley: But sir...
Henry J. Waternoose: ROAR!
Henry J. Waternoose: Well done James. Well done. Well Gentleman, I hope you've all learnt a valuable lesson...
Mike: One of these days I am really... gonna let you teach that guy a lesson.
Henry J. Waternoose: I hope you're happy, Sullivan. You destroyed this company. Monsters Incorporated is dead! Where will everyone get their scream now? The energy crisis will only get worse, because of you!
Randall: Look at everybody's favorite scarer now, you stupid, pathetic waste!
Randall: You've been number one for too long, Sullivan. Now your time is up. And don't worry, I'll take good care of the kid.
Boo: Roar! Roar!
Sulley: She's not scared of you any more.
Boo: Roar!
Sulley: Looks like you're out of a job.
Mike: C'mon, fight that plaque! Fight that plaque! Scary monsters don't have plaque!
Mike: I don't know, but it's been said, I love scaring kids in bed!
Mike: Just think about a few names for a second: Bigfoot. Loch Ness. The Abominable Snowman. They all have one thing in common, pal: Banishment! We could be next!
Mike: Oh, Schmootsie-poo?
Celia: Googlie Bear.
Mike: You're the boss! You're the boss! You're the big, hairy boss!
Fungus: Randall?
Randall: What?
Fungus: Look!
Celia: Attention everyone! We have a New Scare Leader. Randall Boggs.
Celia: Nevermind.
Mike: Come on, hop on in.
Sulley: No way, there's a scream shortage. We're walking.
Mike: No, come on, It's just-I... just...
Mike: I-I'll call ya!
Sulley: Boo, I was so worried. Don't you ever run off like that again Young Lady.
Babysitter: Aww, what a nice father.
Sulley: Actually she's my Cousin's Sisters Daughter.
Baby Smitty: Mike Wazowski!
Mike: Hi there, shoo shoo.
Mike: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Sulley: Stop making Boo laugh!
Mike: I didn't!
Henry J. Waternoose: Finish him off!
Randall: You don't know how long I've waited to do that Sullivan!
Sulley: You think that he's gonna come through the closet and scare ya. It's empty, see...
Roz: Guess who?
Sulley: Hey Ted, Good Morning.
Rex: Rrroooaaarrr!
Unknown Offscreen Character: Cut!
Rex: How was that? Was I scary? Do I get the part? Can I do it again? I can be taller.
Mike: Hey, guess which planet I am.
Sulley: I'm gonna go check on the Donuts.
Mike: Don't you even get it, you big Fur Rug?
Mike: Oh, nice doggy. Nice *Big* Doggie.
Mike: Sulley, open the door. Open the door.
Mike: OK, that's it, noone touches Little Mikey.
Celia: Last night was one of the worst nights of my entire life, bar none!
Celia: I thought you cared about me.
Mike: Honey, please. Schmoopsie, I thought you liked sushi.
Celia: Sushi? Sushi? You think this is about sushi?
Randall: I'm in the zone today, Sullivan. I'm gonna do some serious scaring, putting up some big numbers.
Henry J. Waternoose: What a day.
Sulley: It's just a rough patch, sir. Everyone knows you'll get us through it.
Henry J. Waternoose: Tell that to the board of directors.
Mike: Scary feet, scary feet, scary feet, scary feet, oop! The kid's awake!
Mike: Okay, scary feet, scary feet, scary feet, scary feet, kid's asleep!
Mike: Twins! In a bunk bed!
Mike: Darn I thought I had you with that one!
Henry J. Waternoose: James, this company has been in my family for three generations. I would do anything to keep it from going under.
Sulley: So would I, sir.
Henry J. Waternoose: Say, I could use your help with something.
Sulley: Anything, sir.
Henry J. Waternoose: You see, we've recently hired some new recruits, and frankly, they're... um...
Sulley: Inexperienced?
Henry J. Waternoose: Oh, they stink!
Sulley: Uh-huh.
Henry J. Waternoose: I thought you could drop by the simulator tomorrow and give them a little scare demonstration, show them what it takes to be our top scarer.
Sulley: I'll start with the old Waternoose Jump-and-Growl.
