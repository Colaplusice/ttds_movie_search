Volodja: I killed myself and went to heaven and yeah, it's really good in heaven. But I regret it, 'cause I wanted to live on earth a little longer. You remain dead for all eternity, but you're alive only for a brief moment.
Lilja: Sorry, but I'm not sure it's a good present. It's windy, there's a mist. It's so cold. And this world isn't that good.
Lilja: I'm not your property. Think you can buy me? You can't buy me. You can't buy my heart and soul.
Lilja: Where do I go?
Teacher: A golden future awaits you. Just kidding.
Volodja: But it's the only one you've got. This life is the only one you've got.
Lilja: That's stupid. I'm not going to die. I'm going to America.
Lilja: Doesn't matter. I'm off to America.
Lilja: Do you want to buy anything?
Woman at yard sale: There's nothing to buy here!
Witek: You look like shit. Go put on makeup.
Volodja: Everyone's spitting at you, but you're not ready
Volodja: .
Lilja: Bye, potato-hag...!
