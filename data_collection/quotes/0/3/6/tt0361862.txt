Trevor Reznik: Stevie, I haven't slept in a year.
Stevie: Jesus Christ!
Trevor Reznik: I tried him too.
Stevie: Are you okay?
Trevor Reznik: Don't I look okay?
Stevie: If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist.
Trevor Reznik: Right now I wanna sleep. I just want to sleep.
Marie: Trevor, is someone chasing you?
Trevor Reznik: Not yet. But they will when they find out who I am.
Trevor Reznik: A little guilt goes a long way.
Trevor Reznik: Now it all makes sense. I'm fucking you so he's fucking me!
Trevor Reznik: I'd like to report a hit-and-run.
Trevor Reznik: How can you wake up from a nightmare if you are not asleep?
Trevor Reznik: I wish there was some way I could repay you.
Miller: Well, for starters you could give me your left arm.
Ivan: Oh, no. You look like you seen a ghost.
Trevor Reznik: Funny you should say that. The guys at work don't think you exist.
Ivan: That's why I can't get a raise.
Stevie: Well, don't look so surprised. Even a call girl can scramble an egg.
Trevor Reznik: I'm not in that photo!
Stevie: Trevor, I'm looking at a picture of you, standing next to a fat guy with glasses holding a fish.
Trevor Reznik: I know who you are... I know who you are... I know who you are... I know who you are.
DMV Clerk: I'm sorry, sir, but we don't provide motorist information to the general public.
Trevor Reznik: I'm not just a member of the general public. This guy's a friend of mine.
DMV Clerk: But you don't know your friend's address?
Trevor Reznik: We just met. I don't know him that well.
DMV Clerk: Sir, this is the DMV, not a dating service.
Stevie: Trevor, I'm worried about you.
Trevor Reznik: Don't worry. No one ever died of insomnia.
Stevie: I hope not. You're my best client. Can't afford to lose you.
Trevor Reznik: Gee, thanks.
Ivan: Looks like rain. Radio says there's a storm comin' in.
Trevor Reznik: Guess they're right.
Ivan: If you ask me, it's already here.
Trevor Reznik: You know I'm not at National any more?
Miller: Yeah, I heard about it. Sounds like you almost lost an arm yourself.
Trevor Reznik: Don't you find that a bit ironic, Miller?
Miller: Ironic? I'm sorry, kid, I never got out of the sixth grade.
Tucker: Congratulations, Reznik. You just made my shitlist!
Trevor Reznik: You know so little about me. What if I turn into a werewolf or something?
Stevie: I'll buy you a flea collar.
Ivan: You shooting coke or something? You look like a dope fiend to me. No offense.
Trevor Reznik: I don't use drugs. Normally, I don't even drink.
Ivan: How about abnormally?
Ivan: Who are you?
Trevor Reznik: You lying whore!
Stevie: Get the fuck out of here! You fucking freak!
Trevor Reznik: I know who you are. I know who you are. I know who you are.
Mrs. Shrike: There is a leak in my ceiling. It's coming from your apartment.
Trevor Reznik: That's impossible.
Mrs. Shrike: I was gonna leave a note.
Trevor Reznik: A note? What kind of note?
Mrs. Shrike: About the leak.
Trevor Reznik: How they bitin', Reynolds?
'Route 666' Loudspeaker: You're going straight to Hell on Route 666!
