Bobby Sands: I have my belief, and in all its simplicity that is the most powerful thing.
Father Dominic Moran: I want to know whether your intent is just purely to commit suicide here.
Bobby Sands: You want me to argue about the morality of what I'm about to do and whether it's really suicide or not? For one, you're calling it suicide. I call it murder. And that's just another wee difference between us two. We're both Catholic men, both Republicans. But while you were poaching salmon in beautiful Kilrea, we were being burnt out of our house in Rathcoole. Similar in many ways, Dom, but life and experiences focused our beliefs differently. You understand me?
Bobby Sands: I always felt that thief next to Jesus got off lightly.
Father Dominic Moran: Ah, but he recognized his sins.
Bobby Sands: Did he though?
Father Dominic Moran: Aye. Said as much.
Bobby Sands: When you're hung from a cross you're gonna say anything. Jesus offers him a seat next to his daddy in a place called paradise you're always gonna put your hand up and have a piece of that.
Father Dominic Moran: Aye. Even when it's nailed to your cross.
Father Dominic Moran: Bit of a break from smokin' the Bible, eh?
Bobby Sands: Father Dominic Moran: Anyone work out which book is the best smoke?
Bobby Sands: We only smoke the Lamentations. A right miserable cigarette.
Priest: Life must mean nothing to you.
Bobby Sands: God's gonna punish me?
Priest: Well, if not just for suicide, then he'd have to punish you for stupidity.
Father Dominic Moran: So what happened to your eye, Bobby?
Bobby Sands: What?
Father Dominic Moran: Did you get a dig for yourself? Your eye.
Bobby Sands: Difference of opinion.
Father Dominic Moran: Mmm. How's the other fella?
Bobby Sands: Oh, a lot worse. Believe me.
