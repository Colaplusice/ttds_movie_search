Ash: ... Groovy.
Henrietta: I'll swallow your soul! I'll swallow your soul! I'll swallow your soul!
Ash: Swallow this.
Ash: Workshed.
Ash: Groovy.
Ash: I'm fine... I'm fine...
Mirror Ash: I don't think so. We just cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw. Does that sound "fine"?
Ash: Hey, what do you say we have some champagne, huh, baby?
Linda: Sure.
Ash: After all, I'm a man and you're a woman... at least last time I checked. Huh huh.
Annie: In 1300 AD they called this man the uh, 'hero from the sky'. He was prophesied to have destroyed the evil.
Ash: He didn't do a very good job...
Ash: Here's your new home.
Ash: That's right... who's laughing now... who's laughing *now*?
Bobbie Joe: You're holding my hand too tight.
Jake: Baby, I ain't holding your hand!
Annie: The first passage will allow the demon to manifest itself in the flesh.
Ash: Why the hell would we want to do that?
Henrietta: Someone's in my fruit cellar! Someone with a fresh soooul!
Ash: Old double-barrel here, blow your butts to Kingdom Come!
Ash: See if we don't!
Ash: You bastards... you dirty bastards!
Ed Getley: We are the things that were and shall be again! Ahahahaha! Spirits of the book! We want what is yours! LIFE! Dead by dawn! Dead by dawn!
Possessed Henrietta: Dead by dawn! Dead by dawn!
Ash: You're goin' down. Chainsaw.
Ash: Gimme back my hand... GIMME BACK MY HAND!
Ash: Then let's head on down into that cellar and carve ourselves a witch.
Ash: For God's sake! How do you stop it?
Ash: Got you, didn't I, you little sucker!
Linda: Even now we have your darling Linda's soul, as she suffers in torment!
Ash: You're going DOWN!
Ash: You did it kid...
Linda: Yes! Your love was a lie! And now she burns in hell!
Ash: No. Nooo, Noooo... noooo! NOOOOOO!
Bobbie Joe: It's in there...
Ash: We'll all go in together.
Jake: Hell no! You're the curious one!
Narrator: Legend has it it was written by the dark ones. Necronomicon Ex Mortis. Roughly translated - Book of the dead. The book served as a passageway to the evil worlds beyond. It was written long ago, when the seas ran red of blood. It was this blood that was used to ink the book. In the year 1300 AD, the book dissapeared.
Ash: Son of a...!
Ash: Let's go.
Ash: There's something out there. That... that witch in the cellar is only part of it. It lives... out in those woods, in the dark... something... something that's come back from the dead.
Bobbie Joe: I hope you rot down there!
Ash: Open the door. There's something down here!
Annie: Open it. Quickly!
Jake: It's a trick!
Professor Raymond Knowby: Recite the passages... dispel the evil... save my soul... and your own minds!
