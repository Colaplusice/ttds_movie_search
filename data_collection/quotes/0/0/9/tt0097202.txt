Lee: He looks determined... without being ruthless. There's something heroic about him. He doesn't look like a killer. He comes across so calm... acts like he has a dream... eyes full of passion.
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): Easy to pick up, hard to put down.
Johnny Weng: What's going on? Why are you putting yourself out for this schmuck? I don't understand you. You got a serious case of conscience.
Sydney: He's my best friend, Mr. Weng.
Johnny Weng: Buddy, this ain't no kindergarten.
Sgt. Randy Chang: You can't win all the time. But you can't lose forever, either.
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): Are you always so determined?
Lee: Yes, it's my style.
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): Mine too.
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): I always leave one bullet, either for myself or for my enemy.
Lee: You sang beautifully just now.
Jennie: I sing for him, and he isn't here.
Lee: Jeffrey? You sing with such emotion about him. I feel like I know him. Thanks for sharing something so important.
Jennie: I just wish he were here now.
Lee: Wherever he may roam, you'll be in his thoughts, Jenny. The better part of him will always be here.
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): They aren't just gonna let me walk out. I have no future! Can't you see that? Walk out and tell 'em you're a cop; see what happens to you! You think that'll make any difference?
Lee: He's heroic in manner. He doesn't look like a killer
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): I thought those I killed deserved to die. Now I believe everbody has the right to live.
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): You're an unusual cop.
Lee: Well, you're an unusual killer.
Lee: I believe in justice, but nobody trusts me.
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): I have the same problem.
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): Would you rather see me dead or set free?
Lee: Neither, if fate spares us.
Chief Inspector Tu: You always were a pain in the ass, as far as I'm concerned. Just do me a favor and prove me wrong.
Johnny Weng: I'm not interested in any goddamn rules! I want the bastard dead!
Lee: Life's cheap. It only takes one bullet... He's no ordinary assassin; I hope we're just looking for one man. If I'm not mistaken, this man is not a cold-blooded murderer.
Sgt. Randy Chang: It only takes one bullet, cold-blooded or not.
Lee: Do all killers have a sense of honor?
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): The world has changed. Honor is now a dirty word.
Lee: Don't move!
Jennie: Who is it?
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): It's Dumbo. He's come to say bon voyage.
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): We're the same.
Lee: No, we're not the same! I uphold the law and you break it!
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): Arrest me later! Fight now!
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): I think you and I could be friends.
Lee: If I put my gun down, right? That's your condition?
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): Can you do it? (No response) At least we can be temporary friends. We have a common enemy.
Lee: I wish I could have a friend like you.
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): You will, in the next life.
Johnny Weng: Sometimes I think you're not human.
Sydney: Sometimes dogs are superior to men.
Sydney: Don't let me die like this. I hate it. Will you give me a hero's death, old friend? You see, I... I didn't keep one last bullet.
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): I understand, Sydney. I have one.
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): Don't hurt her, you maniac!
Johnny Weng: No, I won't hurt her. I'll blow her head off!
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): I felt someone walk over my grave.
Joe (Cantonese)/Jeffrey (English): I've changed - I don't want to kill.
Sydney: I did it for you, Jeff, the only friend I ever had.
