Sonny: Is there any special country you wanna go to?
Sal: Wyoming.
Sonny: Sal, Wyoming's not a country.
Sonny: Kiss me.
Det. Sgt. Eugene Moretti: What?
Sonny: Kiss me. When I'm being fucked, I like to get kissed a lot.
Sonny: I don't wanna talk to some flunky pig trying to calm me man.
Det. Sgt. Eugene Moretti: Now you don't have to be calling me pig for...
Sonny: What is he doing?
Det. Sgt. Eugene Moretti: Will you get back there!
Sonny: What are you moving in there for?
Det. Sgt. Eugene Moretti: Will you get the fuck back there! Get back there will you!
Sonny: What's he doing? Go back there man! He wants to kill me so bad he can taste it! Huh? ATTICA! ATTICA! ATTICA! ATTICA ATTICA! ATTICA! ATTICA! ATTICA! ATTICA! ATTICA!
Sonny: ATTICA! ATTICA! REMEMBER ATTICA?
Sonny: You'd like to kill me? Bet you would.
Sheldon: I wouldn't like to kill you. I will if I have to.
Sonny: It's your job, right? The guy who kills me... I hope he does it because he hates my guts, not because it's his job.
Sonny: I'm a fuck-up and I'm an outcast. If you get near me you're gonna get it- you're gonna get fucked over and fucked out.
Pizza Boy: I'm a fucking star!
Sonny: Tell them to put their guns down! Put the fucking guns down! Put 'em down! Put 'em down! Put the fucking guns down! Put those guns down! Attica! Attica! You got it, man! You got it, man! You got it, man! You got it! You got it!
Sonny: I'm robbing a bank because they got money here. That's why I'm robbing it.
TV Anchorman: No, what I mean is why do you feel you have to steal for money? Couldn't you get a job?
Sonny: Uh, no. Doing what? You know if you want a job you've got to be a member of a union. See, and if you got no union card you don't get a job.
TV Anchorman: What about non-union occupations?
Sonny: What's wrong with this guy? What do you mean non-union, like what? A bank teller? You know how much a bank teller makes a week? Not much. A hundred and fifteen to start, right? Now are you going to live on that? I got a wife and a couple of kids, how am I going to live on that? What do you make a week?
TV Anchorman: Well I'm here to talk to you Sonny...
Sonny: Well I'm talking to you. We're entertainment, right? What do you got for us?
TV Anchorman: Well what do you want to get for it? Do you expect to be paid because...
Sonny: No, I don't want to be paid, I don't need to be paid. Look, I'm here with my partner and nine other people, see. And we're dying, man. You know? You're going to see our brains on the sidewalk, they're going to spill our guts out. Now are you going to show that on television? Have all your housewives look at that? Instead of As The World Turns? I mean what do you got for me? I want something for that.
TV Anchorman: Sonny, you could give up?
Sonny: Give up? Right. Have you ever been in prison?
TV Anchorman: No!
Sonny: No! Well let's talk about something you fucking know about, okay? How much do you make a week? That's what I want to hear. Are you going to talk to me about that?
Sonny: Hey, what the fuck happened?
Mulvaney: I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.
Sonny: Fuck him.
Leon: He won't listen to anybody. He's been very crazy all summer. Since June he's been trying to kill me.
Sonny: I bark. That man there, see him?
Sonny: He bites.
Sylvia: Why don't you smoke?
Sal: I don't want the cancer.
Leon: I mean, how do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
Sonny: You! Manager! Fucker! Don't get any ideas, you hear?
Sheldon: Believe me, I'm on your side on this one!
Sonny: Yeah, my side, shit!
Sylvia: Look, there are young ladies, here. You could watch your language, you know!
Sonny: I speak what I feel. "Watch my language". Empty the drawer out!
Leon: I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body. So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that? 2500 dollars! My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
Sonny: You see that?
Sonny: Put it in your holster!
Sonny: You know I can call anybody, they'd put it on the phone? The Pope, an astronaut, the wisest of the wise... Who do I have to call?
Sonny: Bank robbing is a federal offense. You got me on kidnapping, armed robbery. You're gonna bury me, man!
Sylvia: Anybody got a cigarette?
Maria: Yeah, I do - Sylvia, you don't smoke!
Sal: You don't smoke?
Sylvia: No.
Sal: Why do you wanna start now?
Sylvia: I'm scared to death, that's why. What, you don't smoke?
Sal: No.
Sylvia: How come?
Sal: I don't want the cancer.
Sylvia: Oh, my God.
Sylvia: Give me the cigarette.
Sal: Go ahead, do what you want. I just think you ought to take care of your body, that's all.
Sylvia: My body? What for?
Sal: The body is the temple of the Lord.
Sylvia: You're serious. So you rob a bank but you keep your body pure. Is that it?
Sal: You gonna smoke the cigarette or what?
Sylvia: Yes. If I die of cancer, it'll be half your fault.
Sal: No, it's because you're weak.
Sylvia: Right. I'm weak.
Sheldon: You handled yourself real well, Sonny. A lot of men would've choked, and we might have had a death or a multiple death on our hands. But you handled it. I respect that. Now don't you try to take Sal. We'll handle him. Just sit tight and you won't get hurt.
Sonny: Wait a minute... What are you talking about?
Sheldon: You just sit quiet. We'll handle Sal.
Sonny: Do you think I'd sell him out? You fuck!
Sonny: I'm a Catholic, I don't want to hurt anybody.
Sal: Sonny? You hear that?
Sonny: What?
Sal: They keep sayin' *two* homosexuals. I am not a homosexual. I want you to stop them saying that. Stop.
Sonny: That's all they're interested in - it's a freak show to them. I can't control it, Sal - let'em say what they want. Forget it. It don't matter.
Sonny: What is this? The FBI? Jesus, now we're talkin', maybe we can get this thing moving. First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
Sheldon: No more favors. That's all over, Sonny.
Sonny: Aw, Jesus... you been doin' us favors all night!
Sheldon: I've got a jet. I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour. I want the hostages.
Sonny: Bullshit!
Sheldon: I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
Sonny: Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
Sheldon: Okay... when do I get them?
Sonny: At the airport. We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
Sheldon: I want them all.
Sonny: I want to talk to Leon.
Sheldon: I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
Sonny: You got guts. You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
Sheldon: I have to see.
Sonny: I'll fly into the tropics, fuck the snow.
Sonny: Sal? Ready to go?
Sal: Tell the TV to stop saying there's 2 homosexuals in here.
Sheldon: I will, Sal.
Sal: What'd he say?
Sonny: He was talkin' about arrangements . we were talkin' about the TV.
Sal: Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Sonny: He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.
