Mutsuta's wife: You're too sharp. That's your trouble. You're like a drawn sword. Sharp, naked without a sheath. You cut well. But good swords are kept in their sheaths.
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: He was exactly like me. A naked sword. He didn't stay in his sheath.
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: See ya around.
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: Stupid friends are dangerous.
Mutsuta's wife: Killing people is a bad habit.
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: If it sounds too good to be true it usually is.
Mutsuta, the Chamberlain: Once as I rode by, someone said "the rider has a longer face than the horse."
Iori Izaka: I met the Superintendent.
Samurai: What did he say?
Iori Izaka: He was cooperative. At first he looked embarrassed, but the story of my uncle shocked him. He pondered. "All right", he said, "I'll help you. I'll talk with your group. Gather them quickly. That's what he said."
Samurai: He's great!
Samurai: Right!
Samurai: A powerful support for us. Not a good-natured scarecrow.
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: Wait.
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: An interesting story.
Iori Izaka: Don't let him go!
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: Fool! If I wanted to run, why would I speak?
Iori Izaka: Why are you here?
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: Free room overnight. By the way, overhearing has a merit.
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: They say outsiders can be good judges. Listen. I say the Chamberlain is alright, but the Superintendent is no good.
Samurai: Don't insult him!
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: Take it easy. I haven't seen them. So I'm not cheated by their looks. The Chamberlain is ugly, isn't he? Right? But from your story I judge he's a great man. He doesn't mind being called a fool. Great! But the Superintendent... you mentioned his name with admiration. That means he looks attractive, right? But people aren't what they seem.
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: Be careful.
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: We can't move like this! We look like a centipede!
Iori Izaka: Let's follow them for now. Circumstances will decide whether we attack or not.
Iori Izaka: What do you say?
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: It's a stupid plan, but some excitement might keep me awake.
Mutsuta's wife: Who's that person?
Iori Izaka: It's hard to explain, but he's on our side.
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: Must we fight?
Hanbei Muroto: Yes. You're treacherous. You made a fool of me.
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: Don't get so mad. I couldn't help it.
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: You tired of being stupid yet?
Sanjûrô Tsubaki: Wait...
