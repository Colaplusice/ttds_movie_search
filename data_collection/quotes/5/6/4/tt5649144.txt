Moonee: You know why this is my favorite tree?
Jancey: Why?
Moonee: 'Cause it's tipped over, and it's still growing.
Moonee: I can always tell when adults are about to cry.
Moonee: Excuse me. Could you give us some change, please? The doctor said we have asthma and we have to eat ice-cream right away.
Moonee: These are the rooms we're not supposed to go in... But let's go anyways!
Moonee: I can't say it!
Bobby: It's only the second week of summer and there's already been a dead fish in the pool.
Moonee: We were performing a science experiment: we were trying to get it back alive.
Moonee: Mmm.
Bobby: Ok, I warned you: one drip and you're out.
Moonee: Oh, come on!
Bobby: 'Out now.
Scooty: It's gonna melt outside.
Bobby: It's melting' inside too.
Moonee: But Bobby!
Bobby: Out.
Bobby: Thank you very much!
Moonee: You're not welcome!
Halley: You just let her get away? And I'm the one who's unfit? FUCK YOU!
Bobby: Thank you very much.
Moonee: You're not welcome!
Jancey: Moonee, why'd you take me on this adventure?
Moonee: I didn't know it was going to rain!
Jancey: Did you not even watch the news?
Moonee: I never watch the news, it's so boring!
Jancey: I watch the news, it's not that boring!
Halley: Aren't you excited? This is so much better than TV!
Moonee: I'm going to eat a strawberry and a raspberry at the same time.
Moonee: Man oh man, that's gross!
Moonee: Wish I had a bigger stomach... like I was pregnant. I'd fit food in there.
