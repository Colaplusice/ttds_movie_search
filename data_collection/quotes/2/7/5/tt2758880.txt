Necla: Philanthropy isn't tossing a bone to a hungry dog, it's sharing when you are just as hungry.
Aydin: Not seeing a man for what he is, idolizing him like a god, and then being mad at him, because he's not a god. Do you think that's fair?
Aydin: Justice doesn't even exist in nature, why should it exist here?
Aydin: Nihal, I didn't go away. I couldn't. Whether it's because I've grown old, or I've gone mad, or because I've become a different man, think what you like. I just don't know. But this new man inside me for a few days won't let me go away. Please, don't ask me to go either. I now understand nothing is calling me to Istanbul. Everything is alien to me there as it is everywhere else. I want you to know that I have no one but you. And I miss you every minute, every second that goes by. But my pride will never let me tell you this. I know very well how to terrible or impossible it would be to part from you. Just as I know that you do not love me anymore. I know we can't go back to the old days. And there is no need to. Take me with you like a servant, like a slave. And let us continue our life even if we do it your way. Forgive me.
