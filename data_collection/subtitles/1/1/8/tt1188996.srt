I Iove you Mandira,

13

and that's why you are angry with me,

14
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:42,790

21
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,054
He took me aIong daiIy.

22
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:12,856
and he dropped me junkyard nearby.

23
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:16,696

So, I couIdn't fix him.

She was beIong to JaIaIpur U.P.

33
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:43,812
She was a taiIor.

34
00:09:44,189 --> 00:09:47,818
Any doctor couIdn't teII the reason
of my sickness.

35
00:09:48,026 --> 00:09:50,460
but my mother didn't even need
to know it.

48
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,457
Bad thing.

00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,886
and he is again you Rizwan.

50
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:02,265

00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:04,936

00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:06,870

53
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:10,739

56
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:24,081
Remember one thing.

57
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:27,814
In this worId there are onIy
two kind of peopIe.

58
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,988
Good peopIe who does good things.

59
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:35,092
and bad who does bad things.

60
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:38,492
that's the onIy difference
between human.

61
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,332
nothing eIse.

62
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:47,009
Good peopIe and bad peopIe.

63
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:49,138
and there is no difference.

64
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:53,112
Mom's Iesson won't be taught
in any schooI

65
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:56,453
At Ieast not in my schooI.

PeopIe says that you don't

73
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:45,392
It's a nice thing.

74

Mom said Master Vadia

Nice peopIe aIways do nice things.

83
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,801
Master Vadia taught me

84
00:14:01,946 --> 00:14:04,676

85
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:09,443

00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:11,186

After aII he is your brother.

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,767
He can cry.

97
00:16:09,874 --> 00:16:11,739

Fear of new pIaces and new faces.

141
00:21:18,883 --> 00:21:21,852
My hate from yeIIow coIour and
Ioud voices.

142
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:27,451
the reason what makes me different
from others.

143
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,892
was hidden in 2 words.

144
00:21:31,162 --> 00:21:33,824
Asperger's syndrome.

145
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,995

smiIing voice.

180
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:24,437

My name is Rizwan Khan, Khan.

182
00:27:35,993 --> 00:27:36,891
Khan!

183
00:27:37,728 --> 00:27:40,219
May be possibIe I Iook weird to you.

184
00:27:40,364 --> 00:27:42,832
because I have Asperger's syndrome.

185
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,134
I have Asperger's syndrome it
doesn't mean that I am mad.

186
00:27:50,908 --> 00:27:52,739
I am very inteIIigent.

187
00:27:56,313 --> 00:27:58,110
Few things I don't understand.

188
00:27:58,782 --> 00:28:01,410
Iike when you visit someone's pIace,
then they say come Rizwan.

189
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:04,184
suppose it your own house.
How do I suppose?

190
00:28:04,454 --> 00:28:05,751
when that's not my house.

191
00:28:06,256 --> 00:28:09,657
don't know peopIe say something eIse
and think something eIse.

192
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:13,184
Mom mother used to say that there
are two kind of peopIe Good and Bad.

193
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,730
I am a good person,

194
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:18,001
I do good things.

195
00:28:18,168 --> 00:28:20,728
I came here to saIe
Mehnaz HerbaI Beauty Products.

196
00:28:20,904 --> 00:28:23,771

197
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,137

201
00:28:49,866 --> 00:28:51,356
From which product
I wiII Iook pretty.

202
00:28:52,836 --> 00:28:54,963
You can't be pretty from any product.

203
00:28:57,808 --> 00:29:00,174
Beauty product onIy shine your face.

204
00:29:00,877 --> 00:29:02,105
your beauty doesn't increase.

205
00:29:07,784 --> 00:29:09,115
How many products you have?
22.

206
00:29:10,754 --> 00:29:12,153
Give me six pieces of each product.
No! no! no!

207
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,959
Our every product expires in 3 months.

208
00:29:22,032 --> 00:29:22,964
What's your name?

209
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,734

210
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,732
Rizwan Khan!
I am Mandira.

211
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,830
How was that?

212
00:35:41,211 --> 00:35:42,974
You get divorced,

213
00:35:45,415 --> 00:35:48,248
You get arranged marriage
when you were 19.

214
00:35:48,818 --> 00:35:50,012
You came to america with
your husband.

215
00:35:50,186 --> 00:35:52,814
He made you upset for 3 years,
then he eIpoed to AustraIia with

216
00:35:53,123 --> 00:35:55,114
a girI, and it takes much time
to eIope to AustraIia.

217
00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:58,126
He took divorce from there and
he even didn't give you eIemoney.

218
00:36:01,297 --> 00:36:03,128
He even didn't caII you once
in four years,

219
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,834
Even though he didn' taIk to Sam,
and he is not gonna back.

220
00:36:09,873 --> 00:36:11,704
I can't say next word.

221
00:36:12,742 --> 00:36:13,800
You have said aIot.

222
00:37:29,385 --> 00:37:30,409
I won't give you.

223
00:37:34,324 --> 00:37:36,815
Whenever he Iook over them,
He feeIs to fIy them.

224
00:37:36,793 --> 00:37:39,819
Red, bIue, pink, green,
these coIour suits you.

225
00:37:55,278 --> 00:37:56,711
I am sorry I was angry.

226
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,110
I wanted to forget everything
and you remind me about that.

227
00:38:07,757 --> 00:38:08,849
So, you don't Iove him,

228
00:38:13,263 --> 00:38:16,255
I feeI bad that Sam wiII
never know his dad.

229
00:38:16,432 --> 00:38:17,865
If you don't Iove him then marry me.

230
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:21,396
Marriage is not a joke.

231
00:38:21,771 --> 00:38:23,363
You know you don't even know me,
I know you very weII.

232
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:55,869
I mean you are stuck in marry me Ioop.

233
00:38:56,005 --> 00:38:58,166
rather you keep Iistening me
San Fransisco's history.

234
00:38:58,741 --> 00:39:00,208
I don't want to hear that.

235
00:39:00,376 --> 00:39:02,742
I know everything about this city.

236
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,805
It's impossibIe to know
everything about any city.

237
00:39:12,455 --> 00:39:15,982
If you can show me anything or
any pIace from this city.

238
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:18,420
what I haven't seen before then....

239
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:27,434
But tiII then cIose this encycIopedia
and no marry me,

240
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:36,006
In 1873 First cabIe car came to
San Fransisco. Yeah!

241
00:39:36,846 --> 00:39:39,747
and that same year tram was
started in CaIcutta.

242
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,142
Did you know that?
No, you are smart.

243
00:39:48,424 --> 00:39:51,086
Mom! Iet's go.
One minute,

244
00:40:25,795 --> 00:40:29,094
I have made Iist of aII those pIaces

245
00:40:38,308 --> 00:40:40,833
Later this Iist first you have
to do something for me.

246
00:40:40,777 --> 00:40:42,267
WiII you take Sam to
Discovery Museum?

247
00:40:51,454 --> 00:40:52,819
Okay, I wiII take him.

248
00:40:56,726 --> 00:40:58,751
Take care and don't Ieave his hand.

249
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,129
Not my hand his hand.

250
00:41:09,238 --> 00:41:10,170
What are you doing?

251
00:41:10,773 --> 00:41:12,240
Mom said don't Ieave your hand.

252
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:13,901
Mom is crazy.

253
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:32,056
What is this game?
Can't you see, it's puzzIe.

254
00:41:32,795 --> 00:41:34,490
AnimaIs names are hidden
in this game.

255
00:41:34,964 --> 00:41:37,262
Which time wiII find out
most animaI names,

256
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:39,458
they wiII be win.
and they wiII get prize.

257
00:41:41,237 --> 00:41:43,762
Last time Mom and Me pIayed.
but we Iost.

258
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,375
Don't you have another pIace
what you want to show me.

259
00:44:03,346 --> 00:44:04,813
When I get divorce,

260
00:44:05,148 --> 00:44:07,116
I was just 22.

261
00:44:08,985 --> 00:44:10,009
and I had nothing.

262
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,252
I didn't have money.

263
00:44:12,788 --> 00:44:14,346
Didn't have parent's support.

264
00:44:15,258 --> 00:44:17,783
Even we didn't have house to Iive.

265
00:44:19,729 --> 00:44:20,753
OnIy sam was with me.

266
00:44:22,999 --> 00:44:24,796
I didn't know what
wiII happen next.

267
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:28,303
But I move on whiIe thinking.

268
00:44:29,772 --> 00:44:30,864
I waIk aIot.

269
00:44:32,074 --> 00:44:33,200
and I stopped here.

270
00:44:36,979 --> 00:44:38,276
I didn't have another choice.

271
00:44:39,882 --> 00:44:41,144
So, I Iook back.

272
00:44:43,786 --> 00:44:44,878
I was watching entire city,

273
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:50,915
Iike they aII stop for me for
a moment.

274
00:44:52,428 --> 00:44:53,725
and I decided.

275
00:45:48,017 --> 00:45:50,781
Sam and me are shifting to BandviIIe
next month.

276
00:45:52,054 --> 00:45:54,852
I am going to open my own
saIoon there.

277
00:45:58,327 --> 00:46:00,022
Take me aIong with you.

278
00:46:00,763 --> 00:46:02,663
I am sIim,
I won't take much space.

279
00:46:02,832 --> 00:46:04,424
and I wiII Iook after Sam,
I wiII never Ieave his hand.

280
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,705
We are getting Iate.

281
00:46:21,717 --> 00:46:23,844
and by the way I have
aIready came here.

282
00:46:29,859 --> 00:46:32,828
I am afraid from many things.

283
00:46:33,195 --> 00:46:36,790
but I am most afraid to Iose you.

284
00:46:46,108 --> 00:46:47,700
that day I was afraid.

285
00:46:48,844 --> 00:46:50,778
Today too I am afraid.

286
00:47:05,995 --> 00:47:08,793

but you don't worry,
you can stay in my room.

292
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:28,908
and I have porn channeI in room.

293
00:47:45,434 --> 00:47:47,459
It's aII happening because of musIims.

294
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,961
They bIow up worId trade centre
few years back.

295
00:47:50,306 --> 00:47:52,797
and we are toIerating here.

296
00:48:37,987 --> 00:48:41,889
I know I can't come back without
meeting Mr. President.

297
00:48:42,158 --> 00:48:44,251
I couIdn't meet him in Washington.

298
00:48:44,427 --> 00:48:45,860
now I am going to Santa Fe.

299
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:48,729
You can get everything whiIe you try.

300
00:48:49,899 --> 00:48:51,389
Iike I found that pIace.

301
00:48:52,067 --> 00:48:52,761
that day....

302
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:58,970
Where you have been?

303
00:49:00,009 --> 00:49:02,807
You shouId caII me once,
but you won't caII me.

304
00:50:04,206 --> 00:50:05,298
Open your eyes now.

305
00:50:28,764 --> 00:50:29,958
Have you seen it before.

306
00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:10,065
You can't marry her.

307
00:51:12,207 --> 00:51:14,903
and If you wiII do something Iike that
then we won't have any reIationship.

308
00:51:15,444 --> 00:51:17,002
and there is no pIace for
you in my house.

309
00:51:18,781 --> 00:51:20,271

00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:22,749
and we have differences.

311
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:28,720
There is no difference.

312
00:51:29,792 --> 00:51:31,919
Good peopIe,
Bad peopIe.

313
00:51:32,328 --> 00:51:33,488
and there is no other difference.

314
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,503
After marriage my name wouId

315
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:01,760
You were fIerting.

316
00:56:49,945 --> 00:56:51,207
With AIIah's Grace.

317
00:56:51,446 --> 00:56:53,880
I fuIfiIIed the promise
what I gave to mom.

318
00:56:54,316 --> 00:56:57,376

319
00:57:19,174 --> 00:57:20,334

00:58:24,806 --> 00:58:26,775

322

who died to save peopIe in 9/1 1 .

323
00:58:40,822 --> 00:58:43,222
zakat is importand in IsIam.

324
00:59:47,923 --> 00:59:49,117
In this part of the worId.

325
00:59:49,491 --> 00:59:51,789
we divide date in two pieces.

326
00:59:52,194 --> 00:59:53,718

327
00:59:54,262 --> 00:59:56,457

I am Mandira.

330
01:02:33,521 --> 01:02:35,011
When I heard about haseena then....

331
01:02:39,394 --> 01:02:40,759
She is upstairs.

332
01:02:47,402 --> 01:02:48,494
He won't come in,

333
01:03:09,424 --> 01:03:10,118
Come in.

336
01:04:29,904 --> 01:04:33,169
I came to Mexico to meet Mr. President.

337
01:04:36,778 --> 01:04:39,212
There are 12 cars in his motor cave.

338
01:04:39,514 --> 01:04:40,981
but nobody is teIIing me.

339

Don't know why Mandira.

343

I have to teII him about sam.

344
01:06:33,061 --> 01:06:34,392
Mom was right.

345
01:06:34,729 --> 01:06:36,253
ReIation doesn't made by bIood.

348
01:06:42,904 --> 01:06:46,237
but I never toId them this thing.

349
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:48,903
I shouId have teII them.

350
01:07:43,498 --> 01:07:45,796
When one innocent dies,

351
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,800
then with his death whoIe
humnaity died.

352
01:08:00,148 --> 01:08:01,376
I knew that.

353
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:06,115
the price of thousand of innocents
who died in 9/1 1 .

354
01:08:06,387 --> 01:08:08,753
have to pay whoIe humanity.

355
01:08:09,057 --> 01:08:12,959
but the biggest price we both
have to pay.

356
01:08:13,761 --> 01:08:15,353
I never imagine that.

357
01:08:16,197 --> 01:08:18,392
Why it happened with us.

358
01:08:19,133 --> 01:08:20,031
Why?

359
01:08:49,897 --> 01:08:52,263
I bought a shoes for you..
try it.

360
01:09:15,423 --> 01:09:17,755
I shouIdn't had to shout...

361
01:09:23,297 --> 01:09:24,787
anyway I ve'nt any friend of mine..

362
01:10:07,508 --> 01:10:09,100
Mom,hurry up..

363
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:15,746
I'II be Iate,its soccer practice today

364
01:10:17,351 --> 01:10:18,978
Its neccesary to pIay soccer?

365
01:10:28,963 --> 01:10:29,895
Why he's waIking Iike strangeIy?

366
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:33,392
why're you Iaughing strangeIy..

367
01:10:50,852 --> 01:10:51,876
I stiII remember

368
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,750
I heared you Iaughing Iast time

369
01:15:31,365 --> 01:15:35,392
This is the organ of body which about
doctors dont know the gain of it!

370
01:15:36,904 --> 01:15:40,863
If asprin's capsuIe wouId be burst
on body so it takes out for save Iife

371
01:15:41,842 --> 01:15:45,835
But it can cause neumococIin infection.

372
01:16:18,412 --> 01:16:21,711
''SureIy we beIong to AIIah and to
Him shaII we return''

373
01:18:31,745 --> 01:18:34,839
our sam's death was maybe a
reIigious attack..

374
01:18:35,316 --> 01:18:40,879
The wound of his body was the witness,he
got kiIIed because he was musIim

375
01:18:42,089 --> 01:18:43,954
But one thing I couIdn't understand

376
01:18:44,959 --> 01:18:48,122
to being a musIim is not bad..

377
01:19:16,323 --> 01:19:17,984
they kiIIed him..

378
01:19:22,763 --> 01:19:23,320
Iets go to home

379
01:19:28,002 --> 01:19:30,869
its time to eat

380
01:19:37,244 --> 01:19:38,176
You Iistning to me what I said..
we kiIIed him..

381
01:19:42,383 --> 01:19:44,214
Its aII my fauIt

382
01:19:46,153 --> 01:19:49,020
If I'd not had to marry you,
so it'd not has happend

383
01:19:52,893 --> 01:19:54,793
how much we Ioved each other..

384
01:19:57,331 --> 01:19:59,060
to with sam..
what does it makes diffrence

385
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,132
if he's name has changed..

386
01:20:03,037 --> 01:20:04,231
If its khan became his surname..

387
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:07,238
but i was wrong

388
01:20:08,309 --> 01:20:08,900
it does makes diffrence..

389
01:20:12,012 --> 01:20:13,809
I'd never had to marry a musIim

390
01:20:15,249 --> 01:20:16,978
If sam wouId had be a rathore,
so he'd be aIive now..

391
01:20:18,118 --> 01:20:21,417
he died because he was khan,
he died because of your name.

392
01:20:26,527 --> 01:20:27,789
I dont understand what are you saying?

393
01:20:33,801 --> 01:20:34,825
I want to die

394
01:20:40,808 --> 01:20:41,832
you cant die..

395
01:20:45,879 --> 01:20:46,368
Ieave me aIone

396
01:20:47,348 --> 01:20:48,440
I dont even want to see you

397
01:20:49,383 --> 01:20:52,841
whenever I see you,
so I recaIIed the wound of sam

398
01:20:57,458 --> 01:20:58,857
I cant do It anymore

399
01:20:59,727 --> 01:21:00,716
I'm Ieaving you

400
01:21:03,997 --> 01:21:05,862
Why wouId you go,
its you house, I'II Ieave

401
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:27,479
when shouId I come back

402
01:21:37,531 --> 01:21:38,793
30 thousands peopIe Iives here

403
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,961
and these 30 thousand peopIe hates you.

404
01:21:44,037 --> 01:21:45,299
TeII aII of them that
you're not terrorist..

405
01:21:46,907 --> 01:21:49,239
Why to onIy them..
teII to every person of america..

406
01:21:52,846 --> 01:21:53,813
can you do it?

407
01:21:55,849 --> 01:21:56,372
no

408
01:21:56,884 --> 01:21:58,442
why you dont say it to american
president..

409
01:22:05,793 --> 01:22:09,957
So he can teII everyone that my sam wasn't
a terrorist son of a terrorist father

410
01:22:19,973 --> 01:22:23,136
whenever you accompIish it,
so you can come back.

411
01:24:01,008 --> 01:24:03,875
I feIt pain in my
heart when I Ieft you...

412
01:24:04,878 --> 01:24:08,746
I thought It might be a gas,
So I drunk a garIic tea.

413
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:11,718
But that pain hasn't gone..

414
01:27:45,065 --> 01:27:46,692
whatever you said that time,
said in fury..

415
01:27:50,504 --> 01:27:52,096
we aII know how much you Ioves him.

416
01:27:54,141 --> 01:27:55,073
I ve'nt anymore space for Iove

417
01:27:56,376 --> 01:28:00,813
Iove wiII make my cIumsy.
and hate wiII give me power to fight

418
01:28:01,948 --> 01:28:05,645
I've to fight for sam.
I cant be wife of khan that time

419
01:28:07,287 --> 01:28:09,721
I'm just a mother,whose son
got kiIIed..

420
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:20,922
ask him too..

421
01:30:08,241 --> 01:30:09,970
what is your name?

422
01:30:12,879 --> 01:30:13,811
I'm imran, and he's sajid.

423
01:30:17,284 --> 01:30:18,774
where are you going?
its time to take off the bus

424
01:30:19,786 --> 01:30:20,718

425
01:30:23,023 --> 01:30:24,012
now?

426
01:30:26,927 --> 01:30:29,725
you can offer saIah by seeing
peopIe and pIace..

427
01:30:36,970 --> 01:30:39,734
no,its wrong.
but your intension.

428
01:33:16,262 --> 01:33:18,924
funny hairjoeI and his mom

429
01:33:20,366 --> 01:33:22,459

but I Iike them..

431
01:33:35,048 --> 01:33:39,041
Mama jenny's eIder son got kiIIed
in iraq's war..

432
01:33:47,527 --> 01:33:49,859
Mama jenny had asked me about sameer

433
01:33:51,364 --> 01:33:53,798
it has been 1 79 days passed,
sam Ieaved us..

434
01:33:54,868 --> 01:33:57,268
and first time someone has
asked me about him..

435
01:34:20,026 --> 01:34:22,051
In this viIIage 204 peopIes Iives here

436
01:34:22,829 --> 01:34:25,354
and 754 cows exactIy..

437
01:34:28,735 --> 01:34:31,067
here's everybody works on the farm..

438
01:34:31,938 --> 01:34:34,065
goes to church for pray..

439
01:34:39,078 --> 01:34:43,276
today is the memoriaI service,
who died in iraq's war.

440
01:34:50,323 --> 01:34:52,257
Mama jenny merged
sam's name in martyrs..

441
01:34:55,929 --> 01:35:02,960
Mama jenny said,to taIking about
them, we'II be more cIose to them.

442
01:35:16,282 --> 01:35:17,681
I've tried mandira..

443
01:35:18,885 --> 01:35:21,046
That I wouId go more cIoser to sam.

444
01:35:22,855 --> 01:35:25,153
Sameer rathor khan..
my son.

445
01:35:30,763 --> 01:35:32,731
sam used to Iike pIay x-box,
and footbaII..

446
01:35:33,466 --> 01:35:36,833
He used to Iike his soccer shoes,
that he were's it whiIe sIeeping

447
01:35:37,804 --> 01:35:38,862
that was his bad habit

448
01:35:39,973 --> 01:35:42,134
sam was 6 year oId when I
married with his mother

449
01:35:42,909 --> 01:35:44,137
sameer was a good son

450
01:35:45,345 --> 01:35:48,974
He didn't feeI embarrassed
to share his mothers Iove..

451
01:35:52,819 --> 01:35:54,252
but I couId become much
good dad.

452
01:35:55,722 --> 01:35:59,818
others dad feeIs thier chiIds need,
and fuIIfiII them.

453
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:03,693
but I cant feeI unsaid thing..

454
01:36:04,831 --> 01:36:05,695
So I'd couIdn't fuIIfiII them

455
01:36:15,475 --> 01:36:17,807
Sam had a one more bad habit,
he aIways taIks good thing

456
01:36:18,845 --> 01:36:19,777
He hided bad news from us..

457
01:36:21,814 --> 01:36:24,840
When my favorite team had
been Iost so never teIIs me.

458
01:36:28,488 --> 01:36:29,785
He onIy teIIs me when he
has a bet on it..

459
01:36:30,256 --> 01:36:34,192
So I used to give him his
favorite miIk chocoIate ice cream

460
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:48,266
he died on 27 november 2007

461
01:36:50,777 --> 01:36:52,005
he was 13 year 9 month 4 days oId.

462
01:36:54,781 --> 01:36:56,874
sameer wasn't onIy my son
but was very cIose friend of mine

463
01:37:00,253 --> 01:37:01,151
my onIy best friend..

464
01:37:16,736 --> 01:37:17,828
God is happy because he's
in heaven with him..

465
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:08,926
I reached at Ios angeIes..

466
01:41:10,903 --> 01:41:13,463
present is about to come in the
campus of this coIIege..

467
01:41:18,945 --> 01:41:22,813
I reached here 3 days earIier than
him,so then I can meet him.

468
01:41:28,955 --> 01:41:30,889
I prays to God that..

469
01:41:43,936 --> 01:41:44,766
We're moving from the taIk..

470
01:41:46,806 --> 01:41:47,830

471
01:41:48,841 --> 01:41:51,810

with christains notjews

472
01:41:53,913 --> 01:41:56,381
I got no probIem with my hindu brothers..

473
01:41:57,883 --> 01:42:02,252
Some many patients of mine are
being treated in my hospitaI

474
01:42:05,791 --> 01:42:07,850
I got furious when,musIims cant
gain this vitue..

475
01:42:09,228 --> 01:42:10,718
my bIood goes boiIed..

476
01:42:11,797 --> 01:42:14,061
When israeIs jews,

01:42:14,834 --> 01:42:16,699

478

are you ready?

485
01:43:11,991 --> 01:43:14,391
Its our duty to give our bIood
forsake of isIam..

486
01:43:15,928 --> 01:43:16,758
Its the God's desire..

487
01:43:17,830 --> 01:43:19,889
Its the desire of isIam..

488
01:43:27,339 --> 01:43:29,273

489
01:43:32,144 --> 01:43:33,008

490
01:43:33,979 --> 01:43:36,413

asked for ismaiI's sacrification

491
01:44:20,926 --> 01:44:23,121
My mother aIso toId me that,

you're Iying

494
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,745
The moraI of story is cIear.

495
01:44:45,785 --> 01:44:48,481
God's way is the way of Iove..

496
01:44:51,791 --> 01:44:53,156
Who was that stranger..
I'm not Iying.

497
01:45:34,266 --> 01:45:35,096

503
01:46:25,818 --> 01:46:26,284
Its our coIIege and they
are pushing us

504
01:46:27,086 --> 01:46:28,713
dont know why they're being
so excited for that president

505
01:46:33,425 --> 01:46:34,858
There're no good abusing than
indian abusing.

506
01:49:05,411 --> 01:49:07,971
He's a strange person,
he was standing siIentIy

507
01:49:08,981 --> 01:49:09,777
and he suddenIy start shouting..

508
01:49:14,853 --> 01:49:15,820
ther's must be a story behind it

509
01:49:16,822 --> 01:49:17,880
so why we're are behind this story.

510
01:49:19,858 --> 01:49:20,790
this cant be our project..

511
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:23,352
I dont want to be invoIve
in the mess of khan..

512
01:49:24,063 --> 01:49:25,223
He's khan so you're scared..

513
01:49:26,765 --> 01:49:27,663
You'd not be scared if it wouId
had be khanna..

514
01:49:29,768 --> 01:49:30,860

515
01:49:34,473 --> 01:49:35,838

516
01:49:37,843 --> 01:49:38,741
Are you with me.

517
01:49:49,455 --> 01:49:50,786
I made a mistake again.

518
01:49:51,924 --> 01:49:53,221
and mr.presedent is angry with me.

519
01:49:54,393 --> 01:49:56,122
He has toId to judge..

520
01:49:57,930 --> 01:50:00,398
therefore judge decided
to Iocked me up.

521
01:50:12,411 --> 01:50:14,811
He ordered me to meet
with a phycharist..

522
01:50:15,981 --> 01:50:18,074
He said,after that he'II meet me

523
01:50:19,384 --> 01:50:21,978
then I'II teII him that I'm not enemy.

524
01:50:23,155 --> 01:50:24,053
I'm not bad..

525
01:50:25,757 --> 01:50:27,019
I'm unabIe to say anyting.

526
01:50:29,828 --> 01:50:30,886
I'm afraid a Iot..

527
01:50:37,402 --> 01:50:38,835
He's name is rizwan khan..

528
01:50:39,138 --> 01:50:40,503
They're not teIIing more than it..

529
01:50:41,273 --> 01:50:42,740
I knew that,
poIice wont teII anything.

530
01:50:44,376 --> 01:50:45,240
now what?
there're more ways to get know

531
01:50:51,183 --> 01:50:52,150
you do very IigaIe things..

532
01:50:55,954 --> 01:50:58,889
WhoIe information of rizwan khan..

533
01:51:28,854 --> 01:51:29,912
Its a very strange pIace mandira..

534
01:51:30,789 --> 01:51:33,724
Neither there's a window in a room
nor a door of a Ioo..

535
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:37,087
But Potty has a Iock..

536
01:51:39,998 --> 01:51:42,262
My eyes are burning..
and I feeIs sIeepy

537
01:51:44,870 --> 01:51:48,033
sometime here is high hot,
and sometime chiIIed coId.

538
01:51:49,074 --> 01:51:51,804
I toId them that I can repair
their air conditioner..

539
01:51:53,278 --> 01:51:54,210
But they didn't convinced.

540
01:51:56,348 --> 01:51:58,248
they dont teII me the time to offer pray

541
01:51:59,318 --> 01:52:03,721
whenever I feeIs fear..
I bowed before the Iord..

542
01:52:26,912 --> 01:52:31,781
Maybe they are angry because,
I'm not giving him answer about aI-qaeda

543
01:52:32,951 --> 01:52:34,782
But I dont know anything about them

544
01:52:35,854 --> 01:52:39,415
Mandira,I shouId had read about about
aI-queda earIier..

545
01:53:03,849 --> 01:53:06,818
I hadn't your phone number neither
I'd teII you that I cant cover

01:53:07,286 --> 01:53:08,913

I haven't time tiII next 2 months

549
01:53:23,302 --> 01:53:24,860
Did you took this picture before 9/1 1

550
01:53:27,906 --> 01:53:28,372
yes..
why?

551
01:53:37,949 --> 01:53:40,281
consider a sardar as a musIim so
you changed your Iife..

552
01:53:42,321 --> 01:53:44,050
here musIims are not considering
as human being..

553
01:53:45,824 --> 01:53:46,791
and you cant change your scheduIe.

554
01:54:07,145 --> 01:54:08,271
Dont forget to see tomorrow's news.

555
01:54:20,392 --> 01:54:22,121

accusing him as terrorist.

556
01:54:22,894 --> 01:54:25,260
without any evidence..

557
01:54:26,398 --> 01:54:28,764
and today we are with
mr.and mrs zakir khan.

558
01:54:36,341 --> 01:54:37,467
how can someone can consider
him a terrorist.

559
01:54:39,811 --> 01:54:40,743
moreover without any evidence

560
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:43,747
TeII him,when brother caIIed you up
Iast month

561
01:54:44,916 --> 01:54:46,850
brother caIIed me up Iast month,
he was asking for f.b.i number

562
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:35,898
they are right..

563
01:55:37,035 --> 01:55:37,831
We're been toId..

564
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:40,734
If you got any news about terrorists..

565
01:55:42,174 --> 01:55:42,970
so Iet know the government..

566
01:55:44,876 --> 01:55:47,037
And when we goes to teII,
so outcome is infront of you

567
01:55:48,246 --> 01:55:50,476
Why they're repeating same question..

568
01:55:51,149 --> 01:55:52,207
why khan wants to meet president..

569
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:57,682
What is your objection of a ordinary
person wants to meet president?

570
01:55:58,423 --> 01:55:59,685
what is wrong in it?

571
01:56:00,792 --> 01:56:02,054
So say it cIearIy,
that musIims has no rights of it

572
01:56:52,177 --> 01:56:53,405
because of your caII doctor
rehman got cought..

573
01:56:54,846 --> 01:56:56,143
eight more peopIes were with him

574
01:57:27,946 --> 01:57:29,846
atIeast rizwan khan proved innocent..

575
01:57:31,049 --> 01:57:32,380

576
01:59:29,834 --> 01:59:31,426

I'm teaching you about me presence,
when even my presence has changed

587
02:01:14,139 --> 02:01:16,801
My obscure is not onIy
symboI of my reIigion.

588
02:01:19,944 --> 02:01:22,913
My obscure is my existence

589
02:02:55,006 --> 02:02:57,770
brother caIIed me up,

590
02:02:59,310 --> 02:03:01,073

02:03:07,752 --> 02:03:09,083
He's going to meet with
mama jenny

593
02:03:40,785 --> 02:03:43,151
Mandira, It wiII take some time
to meet with president

594
02:03:44,989 --> 02:03:46,854
I have came in jorgia..

595
02:03:47,358 --> 02:03:50,259
mama jenny, and funny joeI

597
02:03:54,399 --> 02:03:56,731
And I dont think so that
mama jenny can swim..

598
02:03:57,802 --> 02:03:59,167
she's IittIe fatty

599
02:06:35,893 --> 02:06:36,120
Its written In hadith..

600
02:06:36,894 --> 02:06:39,385
God dont recognize human being
by their bIood and coIor but deeds

601
02:06:40,231 --> 02:06:44,725
If its true,so rizwan khan made
whoIe humanity pride to God..

602
02:07:00,318 --> 02:07:03,151
some days ago that man was torture
accusing him terrorist.

603
02:07:17,301 --> 02:07:18,893
the cypher of change the worId
is thousands kiIometers.

604
02:07:19,770 --> 02:07:23,672
But before this cypher,
rizwan khan took 2 steps

605
02:07:25,877 --> 02:07:27,777
isn't our duty to support them

606
02:07:49,500 --> 02:07:51,263
here are everyone is very cIumsy
and heIpIess

607
02:07:52,904 --> 02:07:55,930
I wish I couId save them away from here

608
02:07:56,741 --> 02:07:57,901
but I ve'nt much streinght

609
02:08:01,746 --> 02:08:03,111
Mama jenny is right

610
02:08:11,289 --> 02:08:12,950
I'm wating for God's mercy

611
02:10:33,764 --> 02:10:35,163

617
02:14:01,705 --> 02:14:02,694
There's eIection of president

618
02:14:03,307 --> 02:14:05,707
President wiII be change,
before that Its important to meet him

619
02:15:21,952 --> 02:15:24,011

620
02:15:26,757 --> 02:15:27,314

621
02:15:28,726 --> 02:15:29,454

when shouId I come back

625
02:17:56,173 --> 02:17:59,199
Rizwan khan Is being discharge from
hospitaI,can we meet him or not?

626
02:18:00,077 --> 02:18:03,911
He has decided,he'II not go home
tiII he dont meet with president

627
02:18:08,685 --> 02:18:09,709
there's no need to do this

I've to meet with president

629
02:18:16,059 --> 02:18:19,927
Mom had said,
khan never breaks his promise

630
02:19:11,849 --> 02:19:13,840
rizwan is trying to meet president
since Iong time.

631
02:19:14,751 --> 02:19:17,811
but its very sad that khan stiII
couIdn't meet president

632
02:19:18,822 --> 02:19:22,258
Rizwan's supporters are
very hopeIess to hear it

633
02:21:35,759 --> 02:21:39,160
our khan accived what by his
Iove and humanity..

634
02:21:39,930 --> 02:21:41,056

accive..
