1
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,939
MEN WHO HATE WOMEN

2
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,092
from the book by Stieg Larsson

3
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,777
Today they pass judgment
against the journalist -

4
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,937
and the responsible publisher
from Millennium, Mikael Blomkvist, -

5
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,822
who is accused
for gross slander -

6
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,817
of the successful financier
Hans-Erik Wennerstrm.

7
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,307
Blomkvist accused of Wennerstrm
Illegal arms trafficking and fraud -

8
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,624
over 60 million.

9
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,617
The Swedes have always had
divided opinions on Blomkvist.

10
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,097
His supporters believe he is
the last idealistic journalist.

11
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,462
But now his long career as
journalistic watchdog may be over.

12
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,500
In the case Wennerstrm Vs. Millennium
Is defendants Mikael Blomkvist declared -

13
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,985
guilty in six of
eight allegations.

14
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,304
The accused is sentenced
three months' imprisonment -

15
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,662
and a compensation of 150,000
dollars to Hans-Erik Wennerstrm.

16
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,462
How do you see the ruling?

17
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,706
We must stop
people like Kalle Blomkvist -

18
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,667
Digging in honest peoples cases
simply because do not agree with their views.

19
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,307
- I have no further comment.
- There he comes.

20
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,307
How is it
to be declared guilty?

21
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,058
Will you continue as a journalist
Mikael Blomkvist?

22
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,497
- Cheers, everybody. God Jul
- Cheers. God Jul

23
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,939
- Cheers.
- How do we appeal the ruling?

24
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,584
We're behind you
one hundred percent, Micke.

25
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,463
We must do something. The advertisers
have lost confidence in us.

26
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,026
- We wont regain that with an appeal.
- An appeal would win us the time.

27
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,619
- We will not appeal.
- This is about Millennium's future.

28
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,662
The sooner this is over
the better for Millennium.

29
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,622
Not to act as the
Devil's advocate -

30
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,584
but it is not an idea
if Mikael left Millennium?

31
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,667
Just until the storm is over?

32
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,861
Merry Christmas

33
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,780
Wait Micke.

34
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,984
- They are in shock.
- Only Janne dare speak the truth.

35
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,341
- I am a liability for the magazine.
- It's about finding a way out.

36
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,222
There are empty here.

37
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,500
I have not written a word
for several months.

38
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,980
Do you?

39
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,665
Wennerstrm
Delivers a knockout to Blomkvist

40
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,819
Jail!

41
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,346
God damn!

42
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,181
It is rare that we show
our research for our clients.

43
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,461
But we have a special relationship with
your client, so we make an exception in this case.

44
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,660
- That we appreciate.
- I must warn you.

45
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,068
- Lisbeth is a special little girl.
- What do you mean by special?

46
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,501
But make no mistake. She is
our very best researcher.

47
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,063
Good morning, Lisbeth.

48
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,498
Good morning.

49
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,540
Dirch Frode.

50
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,943
Prints of SMS.

51
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,981
E- mail. Bank account overview.

52
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,107
How do I get access to it?

53
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,141
You order the product.
I will deliver it.

54
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,940
What can you tell me
About Blomkvist?

55
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,699
- Everything is in the report.
- The short version.

56
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,900
Blomkvist got the nickname
Kalle Blomkvist -

57
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,100
when he solved
a bank robbery in the 80s.

58
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,587
A public person with no major
secrets. Read the newspaper articles.

59
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,260
- But then he does have secrets?
- Everyone has secrets.

60
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,826
How hard is he affected by the
crisis on Millennium?

61
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,737
- Financially?
- Maybe you should read the report.

62
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,418
Miss Salander,
Do you have anything to add?

63
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,145
Do you have any thoughts of your own?

64
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,420
There is something odd
about the Wennerstrm case.

65
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,542
How so?
Is there more in the case?

66
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,979
I must examine him,
not do his job.

67
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,897
I would like to hear
your personal opinion.

68
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,227
Blomkvist is clean. Not one single speeding ticket.
I found nothing on him.

69
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,819
I do not think
he has fabricated false evidence.

70
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,065
Someone caught him in a trap.

71
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,583
Why did you not ask me?

72
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,066
- No lawyer could save me.
- I know. I have read the ruling.

73
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,022
I did not want to get you involved.

74
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,301
But you could have asked me.
I am your sister.

75
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,784
I know.

76
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,424
I'm stuck in the shit.
Why drag the family down with me?

77
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,700
And now your going to jail.
That is far out.

78
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,859
The secret of good meatballs is
that you have to moisten your fingers.

79
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,425
And then
rub your hands against each other.

80
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,746
Shit. Could you take this for me?

81
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,308
- Hello, this is Micke Blomkvist.
- Hey hey, your little terrorist.

82
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,626
- It's Mikael.
- Mikael Blomkvist?

83
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,867
- Yes. Who I am talking too?
- My name is Dirch Frode.

84
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,664
I am a lawyer.
My client would like to speak with you.

85
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,862
- It is Christmas! Is it important?
- My client do not want to wait.

86
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,302
- Call Millennium after the New Year.
- My client does not want to wait.

87
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,307
- Who is your client?
- Henrik Vanger.

88
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,863
From The Vanger Concern?

89
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,379
My client would appreciate it
if you came.

90
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,785
It is Christmas Eve.
It has been a horrible week.

91
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,822
I promise
you will find it interesting.

92
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,588
Blomkvist!

93
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,423
Henrik lives on the island Hedeby,
A few kilometers from Hedestad.

94
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,417
The bridge here is the only connection
to the mainland.

95
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,857
Once everyone came from the top of
Swedish business community to this estate.

96
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,141
Now, its only Henrik
and the housekeeper Anna, who lives here.

97
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,263
Thank you for coming, Mikael.

98
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,739
Frodes call
was somewhat unusual.

99
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,261
- Are you hungry? There is lunch.
- Otherwise, thank you. Let's get down to business.

100
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,143
- I go home this afternoon.
- Then we skip lunch.

101
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,178
Do you remember her?

102
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,461
That is Harriet Vanger,
my brother Gottfried's daughter.

103
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,467
You have met her.

104
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,023
The girl here?

105
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,177
Your father worked for me
in summer 1965.

106
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,905
He was a mechanical engineer in the workshop
and lived in one of our cabins.

107
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,299
You and your mother came to visit -

108
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,624
at weekends.

109
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,986
Harriet liked you.
You often played out there by the water.

110
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,548
I remember her.

111
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,628
- Harriet.
- I never got any children himself.

112
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,542
Harriet was my precious.
She was an incredibly smart girl.

113
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,662
I looked at her
like my own daughter.

114
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,502
What happened to her?

115
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,341
- I think she was murdered.
- Murdered?

116
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,423
This is family Vanger, Mikael.
My family.

117
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,100
22. September 1966. That day
the whole family gathered in this house -

118
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,266
to the annual meeting.

119
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,348
30 petty and greedy people -

120
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,148
who fought over who would
have the largest piece of the cake.

121
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,703
One of these people...

122
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,862
...murdered Harriet.

123
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,018
Harriet was 16 years.
It was Children's Day.

124
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,419
She had been inside the Herdestad
to see the parade on the main street.

125
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,337
That image
was printed in the local newspaper.

126
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,382
Around two she came
back to the island.

127
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,546
She wanted to talk to me
about something, but...

128
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,945
...I was busy
with a board meeting.

129
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,583
How was she murdered?

130
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,946
Nobody knows.
She just disappeared.

131
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,339
You are well prepared.

132
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,707
I have thought of that day in 40 years.

133
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,347
That you can call preparation.

134
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,417
Quarter past two, there was a serious
traffic accidents down on Hedeby Bridge.

135
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,782
A tanker full of gasoline
collided with a car.

136
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,662
Truck was across the bridge.

137
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,828
Tank leaked gasoline
All over the place.

138
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,420
Nobody could get past.
All had to stay on the island.

139
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,985
By accident
the photographer captured it here.

140
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,463
See up there at the curtain.

141
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,778
It is the last picture
made by Harriet.

142
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,823
Commissioner Morell from Hot Hedeby
led the investigation.

143
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,342
He took the film here and had made
Enlargements of this image.

144
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,905
Since then, no-one have seen her.

145
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,861
We waited for her at dinner,
but she never showed up.

146
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,538
- Hello?
- Lisbeth Salander?

147
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,866
- Who is it?
- Svensson from the state administration.

148
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,382
- You have a new guardian. Bjurman.
- I already have a guardian.

149
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,900
Your previous guardian was
hospitalized with a stroke, -

150
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,305
- so I had to
find you a new one.

151
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,228
Good we could meet,
though it's Christmas, Sit down.

152
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,826
It is a bit unfortunate -

153
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,387
that Palmgren has had such a lax
approach to guardianship law.

154
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,263
I see
you've managed your own economy.

155
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,905
- It has not been a problem.
- No, it probably is not.

156
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,705
But as your guardian
I am legally and financially responsible.

157
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,540
That means I get the blame if
you suddenly cannot pay rent.

158
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,708
I have work.
I earn my own money.

159
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,144
Yes, you work for
Milton Security, I see...

160
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,387
- What are you there?
- I make coffee and photocopies.

161
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,699
We do it this way:

162
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,220
From now on, your salary goes into
a new account, which I dispose over.

163
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,467
You get some pocket money every month
for personal expenses -

164
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,265
but all other expenses
I will have to accept. Okay?

165
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,788
How do you manage
your personal hygiene?

166
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,218
What do you mean?

167
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,501
With all those rings.
Don't you get inflammation in the holes?

168
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,459
Do you have a girlfriend?

169
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,181
No.

170
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,107
Have you ever had sexual intercourse?

171
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,464
I am 24 years.

172
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,980
I can choose to write
that you are cooperating, -

173
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,179
or that you create problems
and is being troublesome.

174
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,182
And then your life
quickly become very problematic.

175
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,826
So how many
have you had sex with?

176
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,858
- Two.
- Two?

177
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,828
200. No, 2000.

178
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,386
- 200,000. Are we finished?
- What kind of sex do you have?

179
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,225
Any special preferences?

180
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,667
Have you considered
That might just have left?

181
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,862
No, because of the accident.
The bridge was blocked for 24 hours.

182
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,457
And it was the only way off the island.

183
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,865
Harriet disappeared,
while no one could leave the island.

184
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,938
The day after we thought
that it could be a crime.

185
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,223
But then the bridge was open, and the killer
could have gotten rid of the body.

186
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,386
She may have drowned
have committed suicide.

187
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,458
We searched after her. We put dogs out
and divers in the water.

188
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,581
Even today,
when I take a walk, -

189
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,065
I find myself
looking for her.

190
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,540
When Harriet was eight,
She gave me a birthday present.

191
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,218
A bluebell
from 1958.

192
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,137
Then she gave me
a new flower every year.

193
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,228
1966.
The year when Harriet disappeared.

194
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,417
We have to go to the attic.

195
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,460
Incredible.

196
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,901
Every damn year, I get
a flower on my birthday -

197
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,419
from a new spot
on the world map.

198
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,622
- Who do you think you send them?
- Harriet's murderer.

199
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,781
You do not know my family.
You do not know what they are capable of.

200
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,458
I favored Harriet. It did
her an obvious victim for them -

201
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,104
Those who wanted more power
in The Vanger Concern.

202
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,338
They wanted to crush me.

203
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,547
I am 82 years.
The police have since long given up.

204
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,866
I end up going to the grave
without knowing.

205
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,981
Help me
to make one last attempt.

206
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,180
- Why just me?
- I have followed you.

207
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,107
You are a good journalist. Stubborn.

208
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,586
I do not ask you
to solve the puzzle. Just make an attempt.

209
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,861
There are half a year to
you must serve your sentence.

210
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,779
You have devoted 40 years...

211
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,663
I will pay you
a good fee.

212
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,543
You will be wealthy.
You have nothing to lose.

213
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,059
You have nothing
to return to in Stockholm.

214
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,623
"Blomkvist resigns from the Board
and works no longer for Millennium."

215
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,300
Have you written the press release
without talking to me first?

216
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,825
It is me
who must take the decision.

217
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,818
What happens now?

218
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,898
I will work for Henrik Vanger
in Hedeby.

219
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,818
Aha. So now you
work for large capitalists.

220
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,861
It is not for The Vanger Concern.

221
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,626
Are you going to live there?

222
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,065
In Hedeby?

223
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,467
Good trip.

224
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,057
CONNECTING BLOMKVIST

225
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,226
CONNECTION ACHIEVED
FULL ACCESS

226
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,577
NO NEW ACTIVITIES

227
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,620
I'll crush you.

228
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,899
What are you looking at?

229
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,508
What the fuck are you doing, you pussy?

230
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,188
The whore need to lie down.

231
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,742
- Cunt!
- Down with her!

232
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,104
- The bitch is crazy.
- Come again, pig!

233
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,220
Come on.

234
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,468
Shit.

235
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,585
What did you say?

236
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,466
- I can save the hard disk.
- Good.

237
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,579
And the rest?

238
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,262
You need to go on sales hunting.

239
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,104
- How did that happen?
- Nevermind.

240
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,144
- You stink of beer.
- And you just showered?

241
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,257
You can borrow the desktop PC.

242
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,177
I use it for backup,
so it needs to stay here.

243
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,499
Welcome to Hedeby.

244
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,417
Very refreshing
with this cold weather.

245
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:39,465
You did not want to live in the main building,
so I hope you'll like it here.

246
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,063
If it gets colder,
The water pipes freeze.

247
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,306
Then you must come up to me
and get water.

248
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,502
Yes? Well, it is good.
Just put them here.

249
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:03,541
It is part of the material
I've collected over the years.

250
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,542
There are pictures.
Police Reports.

251
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,987
Newspaper. In addition
some of Harriet's possessions.

252
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,108
It is a start.

253
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,868
You were a beautiful nanny.

254
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,744
What did you experience?

255
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,304
Defending Sweden's purity:

256
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,660
We are the
Swedish national socialists -

257
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,180
Which the Aryan race
can not do without:

258
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,024
Family Vanger is
a pretty unpleasant bunch.

259
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,825
Most of us detest each other,
but are forced together by the company.

260
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,420
In there lives my brother Harald.

261
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,542
To put it mildly
we do not get along together.

262
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,699
Your brothers Richard and Harald
was in a Nazi group in the 30s.

263
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,947
Well, you know that already.

264
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,061
Gottfried was in the Hitler Jugend.

265
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,299
They were all three Nazis.

266
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,384
Yes. Fanatical.

267
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,066
Richard fell in
The Finnish Winter War.

268
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,739
Harald has been a bitter, old
man. He never goes outside of a door.

269
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,303
Harald's daughter Cecilia
Is in Scotland at the moment.

270
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,227
Cecilia and Harald
are not on speaking terms.

271
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,347
In there lives Martin, Harriet's brother.

272
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,463
He took over The Vanger Concern
after me.

273
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,386
Hello.

274
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,900
There you are. It is
the famous Kalle Blomkvist.

275
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,748
Just call me Mikael.

276
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,940
I am curious to hear
why you want to -

277
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,664
spend six months
in this godforsaken town.

278
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,060
Martin and Harriet's father, Gottfried, -

279
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,944
lived a miserable and
alcoholized life with his Isabella.

280
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,097
I have never seen a woman be
as bad a mother as Isabella.

281
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,504
I intervened
and took care of Harriet and Martin.

282
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,906
That was all the family members
who live here.

283
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,021
On the day itself
there was even more.

284
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,062
Cecilia's sister Anita,
who died of cancer.

285
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,387
- Greger Vanger and Ulrika Vanger.
- Stop just a moment.

286
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,864
Who do you suspect?

287
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,099
None.

288
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,507
And everyone.
That is where you come in...

289
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,340
Dear diary. Today I got this
book by my dear uncle Henrik.

290
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,903
A nice, but busy man.

291
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,068
He has finally come home
from his trip and gave me this book.

292
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,338
I sit alone in my father's summer house
and write. Anita is coming soon.

293
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,339
So that is you
who pry into the family's history?

294
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,461
Shit you scared me!

295
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,905
Cecilia Vanger.
Henrik said you were here.

296
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,386
- Mikael Blomkvist.
- I know you from the newspapers.

297
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,660
- What have you there?
- Harriet's bible.

298
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,742
She was often here
with my sister.

299
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,587
- Anita?
- Yes.

300
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,826
The last summer
before she disappeared.

301
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,818
- Strange, since her father died here.
- Gottfried died here?

302
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,305
He got really drunk and fell in the lake.
They found him the next morning.

303
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,182
Down at by the bridge.

304
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,545
This happened
years before Harriet disappeared.

305
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,058
Henrik said you were abroad.

306
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,626
I had to come home
to hide Harriet's body.

307
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,697
We were not allowed to go here when we were small.
It was forbidden.

308
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,508
Thank you.

309
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,668
Dear diary. It is autumn.
The weather has been colder.

310
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,698
Magda 30112.

311
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,068
Sara 32016.

312
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,786
BJ 32027.

313
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,741
LJ 31208.

314
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,500
32018. Mari

315
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,939
I do not understand why
Henrik hired you.

316
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,300
Me neither, to be honest.

317
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,583
With all due respect: There is nothing
to find. Its almost 40 years ago.

318
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,179
I found Harriet's diary
in her father's cottage.

319
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,303
- Yes, but the journal did not help us.
- What with the five phone numbers?

320
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,138
- The phone numbers was a big mystery.
- But 32 is...

321
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,057
32 can be Hedenstad.
30 is Norrbyns area code.

322
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,226
But the names and numbers
do not match.

323
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,217
- Did you ring the numbers?
- We rang. Tried them backwards.

324
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,298
Swapped them, took numbers out.
We tried everything.

325
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,866
The report describes her as
introverted and religious.

326
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,344
Was that also your impression?

327
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,178
Who is not introvert
as a teenager?

328
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,940
But yes, she stayed for herself.
Anita, her cousin, knew her best.

329
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,982
Anita is Cecilia Vanger's sister.
And Anita is dead.

330
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,340
She died many years ago.

331
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,222
Harriet was my first case.

332
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,262
I have thought about the case
every day for almost 40 years.

333
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,588
I retire this summer. It is
only now I can let it go.

334
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,983
There is no answer.

335
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,307
You gain nothing but
keeping Henrik's obsession alive.

336
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,904
Drop the case
Before you become obsessed with it.

337
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,348
What are you working on?

338
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,428
Plague calling WASP.
Plague calling WASP.

339
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,026
Hello.

340
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,458
- Who is this week's victim?
- No one.

341
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,666
Still that journalist?
I thought you were finished with him.

342
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,502
Why do you keep on?

343
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,742
Yes, it is a bit slow.

344
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,225
A new computer?

345
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,185
- Yes, I need 20,000.
- Why do you need a PO for 20.000?

346
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,064
- Game, surf the Internet.
- Do you surf the Internet a lot?

347
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,819
Do you chat?

348
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,618
You know, Lisbeth?

349
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,746
I can not just give you 20,000.

350
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,986
- Not just like that.
- How hard can it be?

351
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,101
Why can I not manage my account?

352
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,537
Hit again. Do it now.

353
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,341
That is what you want, right?
Hit me.

354
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,664
If there are problems with you
I will arrange for -

355
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,622
you are cooped up the
rest of your life.

356
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,982
I know all about your mental
problems and violent background.

357
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,538
Understand me right, Lisbeth...

358
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,585
I would like to give you
the 20.000.

359
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,344
But you know
that any trade -

360
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,422
is based on trust.
I have to feel that I can trust you.

361
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,899
Can I do that, sweetheart?

362
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,987
Can I trust you, Lisbeth?

363
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,864
Can I trust you?

364
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,578
If you're nice to me...

365
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,781
If you're nice to me
I will always be nice to you.

366
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,938
- It's only 7.000.
- More than enough for a computer.

367
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,184
What are you looking at?

368
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,344
You said it was the newspaper's photographer,
who took pictures of the children's parade.

369
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,620
Yes, both that and the traffic accident.

370
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,059
The old part of the archive
is very messy.

371
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,980
We have not scanned it electronically,
so everything is still in negative folders.

372
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,782
20... 30...

373
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,140
...40, 50, 60...

374
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,659
A photographer will take between two and ten
rolls in one day.

375
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,906
Closer to ten,
when we were talking about Children's Day.

376
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,338
Here. September 1966.

377
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,905
I will only need the hour,
of the procession.

378
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,987
- Knock yourself out.
- Is it not sorted?

379
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,704
If you are lucky,
they are roughly chronological.

380
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,697
Do you have a negative scanner
and a light table?

381
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,425
This is the first trace in the case
in 39 years.

382
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,904
It is a start.

383
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,658
It is more than that.

384
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,542
See there.

385
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,900
Thinking about the same as I?

386
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,227
What is it that caught her eye?
What is she afraid of?

387
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,021
Her murderer.

388
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:18,297
About here
on the other side of the street -

389
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,897
Is Harriet's murderer.

390
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:45,098
- Coffee, Mikael?
- What have you found out?

391
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,426
I must have read...

392
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,861
...several thousand pages.
People have been on the case for 40 years.

393
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,021
To be quite honest, -

394
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,781
I have not found anything.

395
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,266
Should you not be in Stockholm
and try to appeal your conviction?

396
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,745
- Leave it.
- No you leave it.

397
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,908
- Mikael is old enough to...
- I was lured into a trap.

398
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,499
One of my old classmates
gave me a tip on Wennerstrm's company.

399
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,986
It was a good story.
Good enough to trap him.

400
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,304
You would think.

401
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,627
Yes, for suddenly there was an even
better history of fraud -

402
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,059
and arms trade for 60 million.

403
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,705
Wennerstrm's name appeared everywhere.
So far so good.

404
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,260
So I wrote the story.
The all my sources disappeared.

405
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,462
And all documents and evidence
proved to be fabricated.

406
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,341
Counterfeit?

407
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,144
It was too lure you
away from the real story?

408
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,466
It was too good to be true.

409
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,180
Do you want something, that
is really too good to be true?

410
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,344
Single malt. 21 years old.

411
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,261
To hell with the past
mischief. Cheers to you.

412
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,744
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

413
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,341
You...
Should we take one last glass of wine?

414
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,422
I had enough.

415
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,017
- Thank you for a pleasant evening.
- Because of the investigation?

416
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,902
My secretive family?

417
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,659
- What do you mean?
- It could be me. Right?

418
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,498
I am also
on your list of suspects.

419
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,902
- Bjurman.
- It is Lisbeth.

420
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,738
- What do you want?
- I need more money.

421
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,578
- That we can talk about.
- I need them now.

422
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,347
Welcome.

423
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,097
Come in and take off your jacket.

424
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,141
- I just need my money.
- You'll get your money.

425
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,545
Thank you for last time.
I hope you also had a nice time.

426
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,344
I will not suck cock
every time I need the money.

427
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,064
Oh you will not?
What would you want to do then?

428
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,905
Should I call
to social services and say -

429
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:30,147
you're breaking into my home
and exhibits threatening behavior?

430
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,740
Then we see how fast you can go
back to the psychiatric hospital.

431
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,945
What say you?

432
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,340
That was better.

433
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,467
There you go.

434
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,386
Come here.

435
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,027
Come on.

436
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,661
No!

437
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,542
I have a... rule
you need to learn.

438
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,183
If you resist, then...

439
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,984
Are you sweet? Are you sweet now?

440
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,145
NORSJ carpentry

441
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,025
NORSJ carpentry

442
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,627
My husband died many years ago.
There is only me here.

443
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,459
He worked in the carpentry
for 24 years.

444
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,344
They did everything from clothes pegs
to Wardrobes.

445
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,667
He has done the cupboard there.
And the lamp, of course.

446
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,741
More cake?

447
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,420
Do you remember whether you were in Hedeby
in September 1966?

448
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,426
Hedeby...

449
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,347
- In 66...
- Yes, 66

450
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,819
- That was our honeymoon.
- How nice. Do you have pictures from it?

451
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,100
We camped.
It was the latest fashion.

452
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:11,386
It was our best trip together.
Honeymoons often is.

453
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,946
- But you have some pictures?
- Yes, I have them.

454
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,468
Who does not store images
from their honeymoon?

455
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,384
On the first part of the journey
we walked in the mountains.

456
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:32,139
My husband had always walked a lot.
So it was some long walks.

457
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,545
He was not exactly
romantic.

458
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,220
Now let's see.

459
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,464
Hedeby...

460
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,468
See there.
How beautiful.

461
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,901
Although the image does not
do the sunset justice.

462
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,100
Now let's see. Here's something.

463
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,346
- There was a parade.
- Did you?

464
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,379
What the hell are you doing here?
I was on the way out.

465
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:25,139
You have misunderstood the rules. You must
agree with me when you come.

466
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,621
Do you hear me?

467
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,583
Let me go.

468
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,143
Do you hear me? Let me go!

469
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,457
Do you like being tied?

470
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:18,260
Or does it turn you on
tying others?

471
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,940
Super nice.

472
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,857
Have you chosen that yourself?
You did not chose it?

473
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,184
I think it is nice.

474
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:15,499
Have you seen the program in which
politicians were filmed with a hidden cameras?

475
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:21,147
We have those cameras at my work.
I had one in the bag last time.

476
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,783
Welcome.

477
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,945
I thought
I had to blow you.

478
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,867
But you are sicker,
than I thought.

479
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:36,938
The products a couple of hours. Think about
what the police and the media would say.

480
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,866
Enjoy.

481
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:42,345
Thanks for last time.
I hope you also had a good time.

482
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,178
I will not suck cock
every time I need the money.

483
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,745
Oh you will not?
What would you like to do?

484
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,782
Now I will tell you,
how we are doing. You nod in response.

485
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,303
I dispose of my own account.
You no longer have access.

486
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,262
I dispose of my own money.

487
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,385
Is that understood?

488
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:48,424
Every month you write in a report
I behave myself exemplary.

489
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,858
Better than ever.

490
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:56,222
In exactly a year you apply for
getting my guardianship terminated.

491
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,307
There will be a mail with instructions.

492
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,424
You should never contact me.

493
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:08,020
If you do, I send copies of the
film to the police and all the newspapers.

494
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:12,219
The same happens
If I have an accident -

495
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,580
or you break my rules.

496
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,780
Is that understood?

497
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,982
I have never tried it before.
Lie still, otherwise you make a mess.

498
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,940
Lie still.

499
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,741
I am a sadistic PIG
AND A rapist

I can not do a damn thing.
It is crazy blurred.

506
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:25,223
- Are you sure?
- Completely sure. I have tried everything.

507
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,546
Well, thanks for the help.
Talk to you later.

Kalle Blomkvist...

510
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,707
Leviticus...

511
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,777
"If a woman
comes an animal near..."

512
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,221
...for them to mate, you must
kill both the woman and the animal.

513
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,022
They must suffer death."

514
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,266
32018. Mari

515
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,383
Magda 30112.

516
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,706
Leviticus,
Chapter 1, verse 12

517
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,627
"...she shall take two doves -

518
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:51,264
- one for burn victim
and the other for a sin sacrifice."

519
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,619
BJ 32027.

520
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,343
"When a man or woman..."

521
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:00,337
"When a man or woman
have a deadcaller's spirit in themselves -

522
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,620
they shall suffer death.
I will stone them."

523
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,863
They must suffer death.

524
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,703
Frode! What happened?

525
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,299
It is Henrik.
He suddenly fell down.

526
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,546
We return,
when we know more.

527
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,784
It is a heart attack.
They operate on him.

528
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,738
- What are the prospects?
- They talk about bypass. This is serious.

529
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,787
- Want a coffee?
- No.

530
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:02,141
You must continue the investigation.

531
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:05,659
- Have you put more on the task?
- No, it is only you.

532
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:10,704
Then there is someone named WASP who
hacking into my computer.

533
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:15,619
I have received a mail with a copy of
one of my own documents.

534
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,537
So he has been
on my hard drive.

535
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,583
Do you know anything about it?

536
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,340
No...

537
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,745
No, but I have a guess -

538
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,667
whom it can be.

539
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,499
You just sleep on.

540
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,739
Lisbeth Salander?

541
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,100
- Who are you?
- You know that. Can I come in?

542
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,305
I have read your report.
Exciting reading.

543
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:29,025
You gained illegally access into my files.
It would interest the police.

544
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:33,984
Like the fact that you still
hack into my computer.

545
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:44,984
If you remove that folder
I'll remove the chain.

546
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,501
What do you want?

547
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,907
- Hi.
- All right?

548
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:15,698
- What do you want?
- Is there coffee in the jug?

549
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,748
How much do you know
about my job?

550
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,861
A 40-year murder
on a 16-year-old girl.

551
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:49,224
Until today I was not sure that
that she was murdered.

552
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,625
Then you showed me
that it was the bible quotes -

553
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,468
on women
to be killed.

554
01:10:55,680 --> 01:11:00,026
- And?
- It is the main trail so far.

555
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:06,425
- And?
- I need your help.

556
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:11,740
- You will be well paid.
- I have a job.

557
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:15,020
You work
as a professional hacker, -

558
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:18,937
but send me a mail
you know I can track.

559
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,741
Why?

560
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,060
What?

561
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,538
But he survives?

562
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,065
Can he have visitors?

563
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,663
Lisbeth Salander is here.

564
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:28,540
It is good Frode.
We talk to you. Thank you.

565
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,547
If a woman
an animal comes near...

566
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:54,298
I assume that you are updated.
We have shared files lately.

567
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,987
Yes.

568
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:04,020
You... What if the quotations
do not have a thing to do with God?

569
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,743
If it is a kind of code?

570
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,384
"Sara Witt was found found
murdered in the family byre -

571
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,342
outside of Vilhelmina in 1962."

572
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,824
Sara? What else doe sit say?

573
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:20,306
"Between two and three o'clock
at night the victim was lured out..."

574
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:26,984
"The young woman's body was mutilate,
possibly after a religious ritual.

575
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,657
Police would not disclose details."

576
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,907
Mutilated, possibly religious...
Was the killer found?

577
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:40,585
No. The case was never solved.

578
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,662
- It's a shot in the dark.
- I know.

579
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:51,385
- How far is it to Vilhelmina?
- A bit too far on a motorcycle.

580
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,905
What are we waiting for?

581
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,862
- Do you want to drive?
- Why?

582
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,907
I have not driven
since the divorce.

583
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,577
Then it is about time.

584
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,706
Female Names
always leads to porno sites.

585
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,899
What are you doing?

586
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:51,739
Sets the computer to search through
some newspaper databases.

587
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,668
We should be in the cowshed.

588
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:45,267
They could not sell the farm after the
murder. It has stood empty since then.

589
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,299
She was found here?

590
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:56,025
Yes. Her husband found her.
Terrible for him. Terrible.

591
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,664
It was here she was.

592
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:08,463
In her crib.
Curbed and beaten.

593
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,263
Animals were also abused?

594
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,743
How did you know?

595
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,947
"If a woman
an animal comes near...

596
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,345
...you must kill
both woman and animal."

597
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,346
- It may be a coincidence.
- Yes.

598
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,864
Damn da, Lisbeth.

599
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,337
If the other also fits...

600
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,345
I have found
an old television program.

601
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:05,382
A program from 1999
about a murder in Dalarna.

602
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,980
"In the series' Swedish murders 'we have
come to Magda Lovisa Sjberg -

603
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,464
from Dalarna."

604
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,420
Magda...

605
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:19,020
"A cruel murder mystery, which caused
police problems in November 1954."

606
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:23,825
- Had we not a Magda-quote?
- Leviticus, Chapter 1, verse 12

607
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:27,180
"So he cut it out
also head and suet, -

608
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:32,178
and the priest shall put it on the
wood over a fire on the altar."

609
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,539
That was literally.

610
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,502
It was quoted word by word.
