{3230}{3380}Karabal Military Base.
{5229}{5328}Ibo, just grab his weapon.
{5332}{5402}Yes, Sir. Sergeant.
{5444}{5543}Are you asleep?
{5548}{5600}Get up, wake up. Go to bed!
{5606}{5635}Ibo give me the weapon.
{5669}{5697}This is not your home.
{5700}{5746}Leave him with the blanket.
{5753}{5805}Get up.
{5844}{5916}Kaya1, Kaya1.
{5926}{6000}Kaya copies.|We reached the station Commander.
{6008}{6086}The second lieutenant is asleep.|Shall I wake him?
{6094}{6151}No. I'm on my way.
{6609}{6711}Sit down, boy! Sit down!
{6760}{6793}Good morning.
{6920}{6976}I am captain of infantry commando,|Mete Horozoglu
{6987}{7094}Turgay Atalay from Kars.|To your command.
{7107}{7186}Gendarme second lieutenant,|Vedat Dinckaya.
{7199}{7282}Communication Sergeant|Kamil Ates, captain.
{7376}{7473}We were expecting you|tomorrow Commander.
{7504}{7548}We came early, didn't we?
{7557}{7631}Why is that so, Turgay?
{7658}{7773}Because of you! To support you!
{7794}{7893}We've been informed yesterday|by radio dispatch.
{7930}{7972}Okan. -Yes, Sir. Commander.
{7978}{8038}Bring me Dogukan, Doruk|and Cemil right now.
{8042}{8106}Our condolences
{8123}{8222}You must be hungry.|Shall have something to prepared?
{8329}{8408}We came to your outpost.
{8417}{8530}Your soldiers were asleep.|We killed them.
{8599}{8698}Then we entered the station, your room.
{8709}{8807}You were asleep as well.
{8923}{8999}We killed you too.
{9052}{9170}Do you know the Subasi Plateau?|We came that way.
{9187}{9240}At the entrance of the plateau|Lieutenant Baris called me...
{9243}{9348}...to come up front.
{9361}{9458}Because he discovered footprints.
{9467}{9510}We need to take go through anyway,|I said.
{9518}{9623}I called Orhan. Told him this.
{9725}{9832}From far away, the sound of Dragunov|sounds like a whistle
{9881}{9980}If you hear it, you're still alive.
{10038}{10137}One of us, Emre from Sivas,|he was at the front.
{10257}{10323}He couldn't hear it.
{10485}{10551}It went right in there.
{10758}{10844}I was paralyzed.
{10861}{10960}Turgay pulled me away.
{10969}{11042}Then I came to myself.|Take cover, I just yelled.
{11163}{11239}Orhan is experienced.|He spoted where the sound comes from
{11252}{11372}He lifted his gun...
{11462}{11532}A bullet hit his left shoulder.
{11562}{11730}He staggered. Wanted to lift his gun...
{11740}{11765}Bam!
{11933}{11997}Orhan!
{12030}{12118}I screamed Orhan!|To make him get back to us.
{12135}{12197}He doesn't hear me.
{12208}{12301}He walked to the center of the plateau,|to the snow.
{12402}{12501}I yelled to the Paramedic|a couple of times...
{12550}{12611}.. but he could not raise his head up.
{12619}{12669}His first combat.
{12678}{12727}He tried a couple of times|but couldn't.
{12736}{12807}Which one of us could anyway?
{12817}{12985}Then the third bullet hit him.|Orhan just collapsed.
{13331}{13408}Roll call in 30 minutes.
{13702}{13801}On the front right part of the skull...
{13809}{13884}...there is a bullet hole, size 1 cm.
{13893}{13992}Another one, 5cm in diameter...
{14002}{14077}...on the back left side of the skull.

{15187}{15247}You know I trust you a lot.|You are responsible for this.
{15259}{15325}Thank you, Commander. Understood. Over.
{15473}{15556}Don't worry.|We will take care of Orhan's family.

{16247}{16293}She's living in the barracks?|-Yes, commander.
{16297}{16332}Give her a call, she needs|to look for another flat.
{16341}{16385}She won't be able to stay|there anymore. Why?
{16399}{16448}You are dead!
{16499}{16558}Are your parents still alive?|-Yes, commander.
{16570}{16637}Good. We'll send your coffin|to them. You?

{17371}{17397}Not anymore.
{17405}{17466}She'll marry another guy.
{17477}{17557}Cause you are dead now, boy.
{17675}{17774}Your mother cries her heart out,
{17783}{17845}the neighbours try to calm her.
{17857}{17914}they are rubbing her wrists|with cologne.
{17919}{17998}My son, she's crying...
{18019}{18094}.. my one and only!
{18177}{18315}Your father is crying as well,|silently inside, in one corner.
{18413}{18479}On his lips only one sentence remains:
{18487}{18546}..long live the Motherland!
{18566}{18611}Long live our Nation!
{18614}{18713}If I had another son I'd send|him too, cries your mother.
{18719}{18818}Long live Motherland, she says.
{18876}{18946}They ambush the station.
{18953}{19019}They kill all of you.
{19033}{19132}We'll send your families your corpses.
{19144}{19243}They wash your bullet holes.
{19268}{19367}Wash off the blood.
{19379}{19478}Then they cover your coffin|with the flag.
{19495}{19526}That's the way they do it, right Turgay?
{19533}{19577}Like you command, captain.
{19583}{19623}That's the way.
{19632}{19731}That's the way the man who|meant the most to me died.
{19739}{19851}He died not because he fell|asleep but because he wanted.
{19910}{19993}They put him in a helicopter|and sent him to his family.
{19996}{20051}That's what they are|going to do with you guys.
{20077}{20137}You? -Ekin Bulut, Ankara.|At your command,
{20140}{20206}Who will carry your picture|on your burial?
{20221}{20265}Do have a sibling?|-Yes, commander.
{20268}{20348}Good, he will carry it then. How old?
{20354}{20381}30. Commander.
{20384}{20461}Then your 30 year old brother|will carry your picture...
{20465}{20543}Your 30 year old brother|will carry your coffin...
{20549}{20608}Does your father smoke?|-No, commander.
{20611}{20706}He'll start because of you.|He will have cancer.
{20812}{20889}You'll even make it into the TV news.
{20897}{20935}2 minutes, bullshit! 45 seconds.
{20938}{21058}You'll be heroes for 45 seconds!
{21098}{21201}A fancy lady will say in a sad tone:
{21209}{21308}Ekin Bulut died a martyr|during station ambush.
{21320}{21389}45 seconds!
{21452}{21528}After that celebrity news.
{21537}{21601}Did you fight bravely?
{21608}{21643}Did you die like that?
{21648}{21758}No, you died because|this guy fell asleep!
{21788}{21859}Why do your parents cry?
{21868}{21951}Because this man fell asleep.
{21983}{22071}Don't be mad at him.
{22077}{22164}Be mad at yourself. You are a unit.
{22177}{22245}You can't act as individuals.
{22274}{22341}You act for your comrades.
{22344}{22508}You don't sleep for him to sleep.|You die, so he does not!
{22538}{22648}You won't just die asleep.|If you sleep, you die.
{22655}{22723}You all die! If you sleep, you die.
{22729}{22805}If you sleep, you die. You too.|You guys all die.
{22812}{22915}You die, if you fall asleep, Sergeant.
{22987}{23079}If you fall asleep everybody dies!
{23185}{23293}Look. We are strong, brave and ready!
{23314}{23384}Ready for what?|-To die in our sleep.
{23391}{23519}You won't sleep! Won't eat!
{23532}{23594}Won't rest!
{23600}{23692}I won't send your corpses,|your coffins...
{23695}{23755}...to your families!
{23763}{23814}I forbid you to die.
{23832}{23925}Understood, soldier?|-Yes, Sir!
{23962}{24066}I forgive your friend|to preserve order in the unit.
{24101}{24251}I forgive him, so you can stand guard|side by side until morning.
{24326}{24466}But if I ever catch you|with your pants down...
{24473}{24560}I'll shoot you by my own hand. I swear.
{24565}{24665}A training accident. That's what|the report is going to say.
{24669}{24827}Understood, soldier?|-Yes Sir, captain!
{25201}{25247}What is the status of this flag?
{25250}{25303}The wind here is too strong.
{25309}{25385}Keeps tearing them apart.
{25394}{25453}We brought a new one. Change it.
{25456}{25515}Yes Sir, captain!
{26501}{26556}How are the boys?
{26563}{26662}Good. They will get over the shock.
{26845}{26915}Every single one of these boys|is different.
{26948}{27141}Their hands, faces, their loves|and fears.
{27187}{27272}You don't notice them.
{27287}{27386}They don't even know why you can't.
{27479}{27617}They come here, because of you.|To become your heroes.
{27623}{27741}They run and don't know why.
{27816}{27895}We make 'em run so it will be|easier for them to walk.
{27945}{28073}All their longings are here, their|sadness. Even their home is here
{28082}{28142}This is their homeland.
{28258}{28357}One goal makes 'em forget everything.
{28365}{28456}They celebrate like they fight.
{28471}{28625}They dance but in a reserved way.|They are men.
{28896}{28945}They laugh.
{29097}{29184}What's going on here?|-A hand grenade exploded.
{29194}{29258}I just came from watch, captain.
{29269}{29345}I tried to adjust the pin to the grenade.|It slid out of my hand
{29355}{29428}I threw it in the toilet.
{29431}{29508}Why the hell is the hand grenade|in the toilet and the pin in your hand
{29543}{29650}They make mistakes, but never lie.|-Have you ever been in love?
{29658}{29713}A long time ago.|-You're not in love right now?
{29716}{29826}They fall in love.|-While I am on watch at night
{29838}{29932}...you light my nights like moonlight|-lf you write poems, you'll fall in love
{29935}{29997}When you emboss my dreams,|I can't sleep in these mountains
{30071}{30139}They express their feelings|through poems.
{30142}{30197}You need to be able to express|your feelings.
{30200}{30249}One a Kurd, the other a painter|and the third a poet.
{30252}{30289}I'm a Kurd too!|-Me too.
{30292}{30352}And you are the guys to watch my back?
{30356}{30416}They come from the most|different places.
{30419}{30492}Tunceli, Eskisehir. Adana, Istanbul.
{30508}{30628}They don't understand each|other. Here they learn.
{30636}{30703}Enjoy your meal, comrades!|-Thank you.
{30712}{30793}His code name is Doctor. Real name Riza.
{30811}{30939}An unknown enemy is coming their way.|You know, the doctor was a student in med school
{30947}{31044}That's all. Departure at 6 am.|Get some rest.
{31060}{31185}They leave to face their enemy.|-Tomorrow we leave on duty
{31205}{31307}Snow is falling silently. -Where are we|heading to, commander? - You'll see, when we get there
{31322}{31509}What will happen to the commando?|Tonight we're in combat
{31517}{31638}Shoot, platoon, shoot!|Shoot, platoon, shoot!
{31641}{31736}They get graded after the degree|of injury of the patient:
{31739}{31787}1. wounded lightly.
{31791}{31851}2. Patient in need of|medical hospital care.
{31858}{31957}3. Patient in need of operation.|-It's urgent.
{31974}{32053}Right. 4. Patient is fatally wounded.
{32058}{32110}They are curious about their fate.
{32116}{32221}Will we treat a wounded terrorist?|-Of course.
{32245}{32379}I want to join the mountain mission.|At home nobody cares about me
{32400}{32488}What am I supposed to tell them|when I get back home?
{32509}{32608}I'm a good-for-nothing. That's|what my dad keeps telling.
{32633}{32735}Do me this favor, captain. Let me join.
{32746}{32899}You need to be brave|to join the mission!
{32907}{33051}This mountain will make a man out of me, commander.|-Take him with you
{33217}{33266}God is almighty.
{33431}{33708}Troop, wake up. Get up!|He's still sleeping! Get up!
{33790}{33999}Pull the pin,|throw the grenade!
{34175}{34281}They leave their warm beds and|start their march to the mountains
{34289}{34415}Snow on my head. Snow on my head.
{34429}{34545}Winds are wild. Winds are wild.
{34561}{34685}Lowlands become too narrow.|Lowlands become too narrow
{34698}{34814}My country. My country...
{34830}{34942}... are the mountains, the mountains.
{34955}{35083}... are the mountains, the mountains.
{35842}{35976}Fate is looking for its hero|and finds him..
{36015}{36045}Orhan!
{37736}{37822}I wrote a report, Mr. District Attorney.
{37830}{37879}Here are the details.
{37889}{37963}Let's type it.
{38050}{38105}Below the shoulder, left and right side,
{38114}{38262}there's a bullet hole, circ.3 cm.
{38443}{38534}Attention, Mr. District Attorney.|The ground is slippery.
{39344}{39443}These boys keep walking,|no matter what.
{39455}{39537}These boys carry their hearts|in their hands.
{39551}{39650}Their distance to you grows|as the distance to the peak diminishes
{39663}{39757}Now they can't understand you anymore|and you can't understand them
{40556}{40655}Who's up there? -They are|cleaning the roof,
{40747}{40844}Did you see Orhans new car?|-No.
{40926}{41019}He was crazy about it.|-I know.
{41094}{41176}He could not enjoy it
{41224}{41293}Life sucks.
{41313}{41426}Come in. You're wife's on the line.|She's waiting.
{41571}{41585}Hello?
{41628}{41747}I hear you. How are you?|-I'm fine, fine. How are you?
{41757}{41815}Do you know when you'll be coming back?
{41824}{41885}Even if I knew I couldn't tell you.
{41897}{41974}I know. I just wanted to know,|whether you know a date or not -No
{42000}{42050}Please take good care of|yourself. -Of course, darling.
{42066}{42180}Commander, Tell your wife, waiting is useless.|She won't see you again
{42192}{42268}Zeynep, hang up there is|interference -I don't understand.
{42282}{42364}The line is no good, hang up.|I'll call later. Hang up.
{42387}{42430}Speak, while you still can, Kaya.
{42434}{42482}Do you listen asshole?
{42495}{42528}What's up?
{42535}{42595}Doesn't Commander Tuna allow|you to leave the station?
{42606}{42647}Don't be such afraid.
{42655}{42703}Why could not you become a man?
{42710}{42765}Instead of living like a wild hog|in the mountains
{42773}{42846}you should have graduated|university and went back to
{42861}{42960}Your cheap propaganda slogans|won't work, captain.
{42972}{43009}Am I not right?
{43021}{43138}Instead of going to your university,|I rather hang out in my mountains
{43144}{43206}Why so angry, Doctor? We're just|having a nice chat.
{43227}{43260}No worries, captain.
{43271}{43341}At the end you'll die like an animal.
{43360}{43400}Wolves and vultures will feast|on your corpse.
{43412}{43519}Screw you, captain.|-Screw you too, pig.
{43597}{43695}The guys who didn't sign their last|will... -Here Cemil,
{43714}{43778}and Dogukan, Polat too.
{43790}{43835}Ibrahim, Resul and you.
{43843}{43930}Muharrem. -I did sign it,|Sergeant. -What? -I signed it
{43942}{44031}Write! In the case of my death...
{44048}{44088}God Forbid.
{44095}{44166}.. I pass on my individual rights...
{44184}{44235}What means individual?|-The rights you own,
{44242}{44312}currently being a soldier.
{44333}{44434}Which means?|-To make it short:
{44457}{44546}If we die a martyr, the government will pay reparation.|- How much?
{44568}{44667}I guess a lot.|-Dogukan whose name will you write?
{44687}{44838}I've got no one to insert here.|-Whose name did you write?
{44849}{44893}My mom. I have a mom but|my father takes everything.
{44896}{44995}Then I'll write my mother's name|in my last will.
{45056}{45158}Whatever, then write your father's|name down. At least there's a name there
{45167}{45276}If anybody wants to donate his|organs, write it down also.
{45285}{45344}Organ donation?|-Yes donation Ibo
{45351}{45404}How's that supposed to work?|Is that an order?
{45417}{45498}No, I won't donate nothing.|That just won't work.
{45506}{45600}Why not?|-Won't my heart die when I die?
{45608}{45725}No it won't. They cut it out,|put it into a box...
{45731}{45802}... and take it to the hospital.|And you do something good.
{45810}{45891}It's an easy thing to say, but you|incur the sin of these boys
{45903}{45945}Do you think that's a good thing|to do? -I don't incur the sin of anyone
{45965}{46013}Suppose they die, shall they|enter the afterlife...
{46031}{46088}...without arms and legs,|even without a heart?
{46092}{46144}He's right. If we die tomorrow...
{46160}{46253}..we enter the afterlife|without our donated organs.
{46260}{46314}That's the word of God,|that's how its written down.
{46326}{46395}God Forbid, if we step on a landmine...
{46408}{46489}...and our arm or leg is shattered,|what then?
{46496}{46552}Then you're a martyr and|you'll go straight to heaven.
{46555}{46666}Your place will be directly|below the prophets.
{46684}{46766}There no one will ask you|about your missing organs.
{46784}{46889}But you just said it. I'm becoming|a martyr if I die here? -Right
{46906}{46999}-So if I'm a martyr anyway|and therefore not accountable in heaven
{47010}{47109}then I'll donate my heart!|-That's right.
{47120}{47203}I'll donate, pal. -That's the spirit.|-Right on, donate!
{47215}{47296}When was the warning shot fired?|-3 months ago, commander
{47303}{47353}What intervals?
{47360}{47453}I'm here since 8 months and|there was only one.
{47461}{47551}One in 8 months? -Yes, commander.|-That's fishy Baris
{47555}{47654}You and Sedat look through|the old files...
{47662}{47818}..and check them for death|zones and shot directions.
{47831}{47930}Calculate the distance and inform|the brigade.
{47944}{48003}In case of an assault we can ask|for an artillery backup.
{48006}{48099}Yes, Sir. Commander.|-Vedat, where are the files?
{48112}{48171}At the information centre.
{48178}{48255}Good, let's check them.|-Yes, Sir. Captain.
{48260}{48361}Why didn't you connect the dugouts?|-The soil is too rocky
{48375}{48460}We weren't able to build|connecting dugouts.
{48465}{48564}Do you send out patrols to secure the area?|-No, commander
{48573}{48699}Weather's too rough. And we|don't have enough men.
{48706}{48815}We'll send out a patrol when the|snow melts. -Yes, Sir.
{48823}{48901}Then we'll see what's going on|out there.
{48904}{48973}Considering this weather,|pigs won't come out either.
{49502}{49573}They're totally shredded.|How are we supposed to sew them?
{49578}{49668}No idea, just sew. It's an order.
{49671}{49764}Yours is even worse.|-Yes.
{50356}{50591}Lock it. Pick up ammo.|Hurry. Hurry. Muzzle into the can
{50602}{50737}Load it, chamber a round,|release the safety, pull the trigger
{50744}{50833}Put in the magazine, lock it.
{50920}{51219}Muzzle into the can, chamber a|round, pull out the magazine
{51241}{51330}Release the safety, pull the trigger,|put in the magazine,
{51339}{51438}Don't point it at me.
{51448}{51503}Pick up your magazine.
{51750}{51800}Come in.
{51860}{51959}Time for you medication. -Thank you.
{53275}{53394}What are you staring at?|There's nothing to see here. Get lost.
{55996}{56048}Put it on the speaker.|-As you wish, commander.
{56700}{56768}Sergeant... Turn it off!...
{56771}{56870}Give me my gun!...|Turn of the generator!...
{56878}{56950}Hurry, hurry... at 2! To the 1 4!
{56956}{57026}Only shoot when you see the enemy!
{57070}{57169}In my right pocket!|What's in your right pocket?
{57179}{57276}Take the lucky charm.
{57302}{57387}He is dead. Turn off the light.
{57415}{57496}What is in your right pocket?
{57514}{57613}We're right under the relay! Right!
{57664}{57763}I can't see anything.|Take the lucky charm.
{58915}{59014}Did you dream?
{59099}{59150}Everythings fine, it's nothing.
{59158}{59272}Sergeant. -Sleep on.|He's as pale as a ghost.
{59303}{59402}Must've been a nightmare.|Go back to bed.
{60786}{60878}The snow is melting.
{60905}{60955}Spring is here!
{60962}{61002}Indeed.
{61006}{61073}I will send you a parcel.|Will you get it?
{61080}{61150}Apricots and stuff you like.
{61160}{61259}Thank you, but not now.|I'll let you know when the time is right, ok?
{61263}{61394}If you need a courier, I'm your man!|-Zeynep, hang up please.
{61408}{61507}I wonder, how long your wife will|continue to live in the barracks after you die
{61514}{61607}Do you hear, Mete? -Zeynep,|would you please hang up?
{61614}{61682}Actually I aimed at you.
{61685}{61769}I hit the boy accidently.|What was his name again?
{61772}{61847}No worries, I'll whisper his name|in your ear next time we see each other
{61864}{61964}After the last attack the|organization will get more aggressive
{61969}{62033}At least this is what it looks like.
{62056}{62172}Every single one of you needs to|act with caution.
{62194}{62293}Follow the orders accurately.
{62300}{62406}Be ready for combat at all hours.|This place will become our grave...
{62413}{62471}...or theirs.
{62478}{62549}Don't you ever forget that.
{62768}{62830}Look under every rock.
{62955}{63032}Clear.|-Clear.
{63056}{63140}They took this path. We secured|this area.
{63143}{63198}Southeast. Southwest.
{63221}{63255}Get down.
{63258}{63334}Their hideout must be|right around here Baris.
{63338}{63410}That's why he's not attacking.
{63474}{63559}We must disturb him. Hurt him.
{63620}{63698}Let's search every mountain, boys. Okan!
{63701}{63763}Yes, Sir.|- Send two men over there.
{63771}{63831}They also cleared|the other side of the path.
{63836}{63954}This area?|-Search completed in this area.
{63959}{64062}He trusts himself a lot.|That's his weak spot.
{64089}{64149}We must make him angry.
{64152}{64209}Let's make him angry then.
{64222}{64307}Go look for a nice|observation spot. -Yes, Sir.
{64338}{64435}We need to find an ambush point.|The 2 of us and two messengers
{64447}{64500}Your medication Commander
{64503}{64561}4 men are enough.
{64639}{64688}This guy is here.
{64737}{64800}You were right, captain.
{64803}{64860}Have you found an appropriate spot?
{64884}{64932}Yes, Sir.
{65036}{65101}He won't attack us until|the end of our assignment.
{65105}{65220}We need to lure him out of his cover.|If we can't find him, he must find us
{65239}{65283}What are we going to tell the|brigade Commander?
{65286}{65341}They don't want us to leave the station.
{65344}{65398}We say nothing.
{65403}{65471}If something goes wrong?
{65474}{65513}It won't.
{65532}{65579}Let me go alone.
{65591}{65636}No, I'll join you.
{65664}{65705}As you wish, captain.
{65742}{65806}I'll revenge Orhan.
{65881}{65957}In this place sin is larger than|man, right?
{66012}{66088}It is written that man...
{66091}{66172}...shall not slay man.
{66186}{66231}Are there men without sin, Ibo?
{66234}{66284}That's what's written.
{66288}{66340}Do you want to read my poem?|-Yes
{66344}{66392}Why don't you write one yourself?
{66397}{66473}If I could, I wouldn't ask for yours.
{66482}{66533}Hello, do you hear me?
{66536}{66603}Follow my words:|I look at stones and rocks.
{66606}{66654}I look at stones and rocks.
{66657}{66714}Look sad, while staring at the stone.
{66719}{66766}Look at the stone.|-Look...
{66786}{66885}I look at stones and rocks.|There they lie.
{66893}{67021}What is their purpose? Alone is|the stone, for a long long time
{67027}{67088}Can he leave? He cannot.
{67091}{67139}Can you?|-No.
{67144}{67243}I ask myself, if somebody waits for them or not.|-Less tragic, slightly melancholic
{67263}{67362}Don't cry, just melancholic
{67369}{67429}Then I think of you.|Your eyes open, they shine.
{67441}{67503}I think of you. I think of you.
{67529}{67627}Don't overdo it. Laugh slightly.
{67644}{67720}I'm glad that the longing will|end someday.
{67725}{67792}We'll be united happily.
{67809}{67838}What's up?
{67868}{67916}What? Why are you laughing?
{67924}{67975}OK?
{67989}{68077}That's it, darling.|-Masallah!
{68080}{68136}Damnit, Ibo!
{68139}{68202}Did you do it how I told you?
{68205}{68284}I did and even swayed with my|head. Just ask Sedat!
{68312}{68376}Did you put feeling in your words?|-Yes, there was feeling
{68438}{68537}Strange. Then you didn't perform it properly.|What's her job?
{68540}{68639}She's as student at a technical|college. -Technical college?
{68642}{68688}Yes.|-Then it won't work with her.
{68700}{68721}Why?
{68724}{68823}She's the materialistic type,|not the romantic. She needs a different poem.
{68834}{68905}Really?|-Go. I'll write another one.
{68948}{69006}Those girls aren't romantic.
{69012}{69089}May I ask you a question, Sir?|-Of course, Kadircan.
{69101}{69212}Rumors are spread... of a doctor|who'll attack the station.
{69217}{69263}Who is this guy?
{69268}{69322}You know, the terrorist|who's intercepting the radio
{69325}{69395}Why is he called Doctor? Is he a doctor?
{69398}{69473}He dropped out of medical college|after 3 years.
{69476}{69545}Then he disappeared in the|mountains. Nickname stayed.
{69548}{69605}Why did he drop out?|Afraid of dead bodies?
{69627}{69711}Is this guy nuts? He should work|in a hospital and earn lots of money.
{69714}{69767}What's he looking for|in the mountains?
{69770}{69826}Commander says,|they'll definitely attack.
{69829}{69879}Then they will.
{69882}{69946}I am your angel of death.
{69968}{70067}Are you out of your mind?|-Put that rifle away.
{70081}{70160}Are you OK?|-Yes, I'm fine.
{70174}{70219}Good god...
{70227}{70281}I thought I heard something...
{70288}{70354}My grandpa made those.
{70362}{70479}Said, they'll protect you.
{70567}{70666}These men are doing a great|and sacred job.
{70753}{70851}As I said before...
{70854}{70953}...we were able to weaken|the terrorists severely.
{70972}{71061}We will increase these efforts...
{71064}{71163}...and as I promised our|distinguished people...
{71166}{71265}terrorism will no longer be|an important topic...
{71303}{71352}... by the end of summer.
{71356}{71414}Even the flag cannot endure|our wind, right?
{71434}{71522}You also fought for this flag.|How could you forget?
{71527}{71626}You forgot! The blood of my|people is also in that flag.
{71634}{71733}It is the blood of all of us|which colors this flag red.
{71741}{71840}But you added the crescent moon|and the star.
{71844}{71921}Just a star would've been better!
{71934}{71988}So you don't like the crescent moon?
{71992}{72091}Go away while you still can.|If not, Zeynep will be very sad
{72096}{72174}No one will be sad if you die?
{72177}{72248}I'll blow your head up, just as I did|with the other two boys
{72251}{72350}You're gonna pay for this.
{72354}{72420}You will die, captain.
{72435}{72534}You dont use the|radio transceiver anymore?
{72537}{72630}No.|-Did you have a fight?
{72638}{72699}We broke up.
{72735}{72787}She's sick of waiting.
{72791}{72890}True. Its hard to wait for|your death news anytime.
{72907}{72973}Then she just shouldn't wait for it.
{72987}{73086}It is a good thing,|if someone waits for you.
{73513}{73560}Open the window.
{73574}{73639}What's wrong. Tell me!
{73647}{73759}Nothing. Don't mind.|-Why are you doing this? Tell me.
{73767}{73865}I don't know. I need to think of Emre...
{73868}{73960}...Sergeant Orhan, my mother, Hlya.
{73964}{74038}I invented some new techniques.|Want to learn?
{74051}{74132}A man is stuck in an elevator.
{74833}{74892}How? Just look.
{75491}{75512}One.
{75582}{75604}Two.
{75906}{76005}Blue. Beret. Does not fall down.
{76141}{76198}Now with just one finger.
{76268}{76313}One, two. That's more easy.
{76345}{76421}Do you know the shop owners son?
{76455}{76517}Mahir?
{76568}{76625}Recently he sent his mom over|to my parents house.
{76635}{76699}They want me to marry their son.|-What the hell?
{76704}{76772}My mom just told me.
{76777}{76854}I'll smack this guy.|That really makes me mad.
{76858}{76911}They proposed to her and stuff...
{76914}{76992}It made my heart race.
{76996}{77071}I guess I'm more in love than I thought.
{77080}{77153}But she said no,|so what else do you want?
{77156}{77235}That's right. But what if we die?
{77240}{77268}Hello? Mom?
{77271}{77304}My son...
{77312}{77411}Nothing, not much to do here.|How are you?
{77418}{77492}I miss you so much. So nice to|hear your voice, my boy.
{77496}{77548}How are the boys?
{77552}{77603}Good. In perfect shape.
{77606}{77655}We don't know anything|about your situation.
{77658}{77735}Me and your father are kinda nervous.
{77740}{77796}We do get bits of information...
{77804}{77903}They aren't related to us,|we are at a different place.
{77907}{77958}We're in Turkey.
{77961}{78034}You'll wrap the newborn in|Besiktas banner for me, will you?
{78038}{78107}Mom, I'm talking to you.|-To me?
{78110}{78150}Yes, of course to you.
{78153}{78236}We're the champions this season.|Don't you get it. Fener is the best.
{78247}{78318}Hello, mom. Im fine and you?
{78327}{78374}Mom? I am alright, how are you?
{78493}{78566}Do you hear me? Is your phone broken?
{78572}{78672}Its getting warmer,|orange blossoms smell lovely.
{78703}{78832}Do you hear the call to prayer?|I pray for you and your friends.
{78855}{78954}I can't stand this much longer.
{78958}{79056}I see you sometimes standing before me.
{79059}{79114}If I blink, you're gone.
{79122}{79221}I guess I am demented.
{79244}{79340}I miss you so much.|-I miss you too.
{79352}{79451}I couldn't wash the t-shirt|you wore last time.
{79454}{79504}Sometimes I smell it.|-Oh, mom.
{79507}{79561}It smells like my boy.
{79564}{79663}I'll send you greetings with music!
{79677}{79776}If we die while asleep.|Will we still become martyrs?
{79782}{79874}If you're confident and|not afraid of death...
{79877}{79936}...you'll become martyrs while sleeping.
{79939}{80015}Is that guy still beating you up?|-It will soon be over, mom
{80019}{80098}No need to worry about us.|-Just 64 days...
{80105}{80169}You serve your country.|You need to endure this.
{80175}{80224}Why? Are you at war?
{80227}{80343}Don't you ever watch TV?|-Your father sold the TV.
{80348}{80396}What did he do?
{80399}{80477}Oh, I really miss you.|-I do miss you too.
{80480}{80526}I really miss your cooking a lot.
{80533}{80614}Since you left, I never|prepared meat balls...
{80618}{80697}... nor stuffed wine leaves.
{80701}{80791}Because you like those so much.
{80803}{80863}Mom, do you cry?
{80866}{80932}No, I'm not crying.
{80937}{80977}Don't cry.
{80992}{81077}Your voice protects me.
{81092}{81188}Your voice soothes me.
{81191}{81254}Do you still have that gold|I bought you?
{81257}{81325}Have you ever thought about me|being in need of you?
{81336}{81434}I too want to be with you.|They won't let me. Do you think, I'm stupid?
{81437}{81536}It was everything I had. I wanted|to start a business with that.
{81548}{81647}You will certainly become mad there!
{81677}{81776}Don't call him dad, he is not my dad!
{81781}{81880}And you will call again in 10 days,|I know.
{81894}{81986}This isn't a hotel. I'm not in the|position to call you more often
{82005}{82016}Hello?
{82025}{82035}Hello.
{82055}{82129}Aunt Hanife. It's me, Soner.|-Hello.
{82132}{82188}Is Esma at home?
{82193}{82233}No, she's not.
{82236}{82284}But I can hear her.
{82288}{82360}Please don't call anymore.
{82363}{82462}Her father scolds me and her too.|-OK, auntie.
{82557}{82656}Are in love with somebody too?
{82709}{82731}Yes.
{82754}{82864}Keep me updated, will you?|We'll be sitting near the phone all the time
{82876}{82968}Is she in love with you?
{82992}{83019}Yes.
{83028}{83094}I love you.|-I love you too.
{83100}{83199}You know I love you very much,|don't you?
{83228}{83281}Yes, I know.
{83285}{83340}It's me. Ahu.
{83435}{83534}You were luckier than me.
{83734}{83814}Will your love die, if we don't see|each other?
{83817}{83893}Love is not the only thing|that plays a part here.
{83899}{83946}You're self-centered.
{83949}{84048}Am I self-centered because|I need to fight for everything?
{84051}{84136}What are you fighting for anyway?
{84141}{84199}What's this snotty remark|supposed to mean?
{84203}{84255}You are there so that I can sleep|at peace right?
{84259}{84345}Youre in the army.
{84363}{84422}Yes I am.|-Of course!
{84451}{84550}So I need to be thankful for every|quiet night. I get it.
{84561}{84650}Do you want to end it?|-That would make it easy for you, right?
{84663}{84737}No, it wouldn't.|But you sound like that.
{84741}{84840}It feels like the right thing to do,|indeed. It is over.
{85153}{85252}Not even a picture of you did I get,|now you hang out with other guys
{85413}{85561}Not even a picture of you did I get,|now you hang out with other guys
{85786}{85885}One day I will knock on your door|with roses.
{86010}{86109}..."get lost" is what I'm going to say.|Live on your street.
{86370}{86527}You tramp, what fun we had with you.
{86569}{86625}You look tired, Vedat.|-No, commander. I'm fine.
{86631}{86678}Didn't you sleep?
{86711}{86756}No.
{86824}{86880}Where does she live?
{86912}{87019}I beg your pardon? Who?|-Your girlfriend, boy.
{87068}{87149}In Istanbul.
{87227}{87286}Are you in love with her?
{87290}{87328}I think so, yes.
{87360}{87459}You know that love is too small|for big cities.
{87487}{87529}I know.
{87658}{87709}She'll cheat on you.
{87836}{87885}Are you prepared for that?
{87941}{88011}I can't change it.
{88017}{88116}Are you ready for the fight?|-I am.
{88160}{88200}Serkan, you?
{88216}{88282}I am ready.
{88296}{88348}You didn't make that impression|on me during the first combat
{88351}{88418}I am now, captain.|-Ready for what?
{88440}{88539}Ready for what you taught us, captain.
{88564}{88628}What did I teach you?
{88643}{88742}Would you treat the man|who shot Orhan...
{88745}{88794}... if we captured him wounded?
{88820}{88884}Yes, I would.
{88971}{89061}Equal treatment for everyone,|right? -Yes, commander.
{89080}{89176}Even this we taught you, right?|-Yes, commander.
{89234}{89299}That was a mistake.
{89302}{89376}I beg your pardon?|-Nothing
{89506}{89605}And if that man killed your|brother? What would you do?
{89680}{89736}I would still treat him.
{89741}{89800}And what would you have|told your mother?
{89804}{89880}A man killed my brother.
{89886}{89967}We captured him but I saved|his life. Why?
{89977}{90076}Because I swore an oath to|uncle Hippocrates, right?
{90092}{90160}These mountains have different oaths.
{90380}{90479}Hakan you are a banker, right?|-Yes, commander.
{90486}{90585}Those guys earn 5 times|the salary we get.
{90589}{90663}Ain't it true?
{90677}{90823}Depends on the bonus.|We have commissions too.
{90833}{90932}What would I need to show you|to get credit?
{90966}{91065}I'm not in the credit department,|but securities I guess.
{91080}{91179}My securities are these mountains here.
{91191}{91307}You would need papers to prove this.
{91451}{91515}I don't have papers...
{91518}{91598}..so these mountains|mean nothing to the bank.
{91683}{91738}When you're discharged|you forget the mountains.
{91746}{91845}Go to the woman you love.|Rest your head on her shoulder
{91868}{91950}And start talking...
{91995}{92065}Oh, you're going to say,|when I was there I shot men.
{92073}{92172}I was shot, I couldn't breathe,|you'll say and cry.
{92212}{92311}Everywhere was blood you'll say.
{92400}{92499}Shed two little tears|on their shoulders, right?
{92521}{92590}And the women will cry.
{92594}{92693}My hero, my national hero.
{92723}{92869}That's how she'll call you.|Just awesome, right?
{92896}{92995}You'll hug each other,|so soft and nothing else matters.
{93000}{93049}Turgay?|-Yes captain.
{93054}{93153}Tell the boy, who is drawing,|to paint not only rocks and stones
{93156}{93232}Tell him to paint flowers,|beetles and butterflies!
{93235}{93285}Yes, Sir. Commander.
{93290}{93345}Maybe then we can get|credit someday, right?
{93367}{93411}Kaya, Kaya 1.
{93423}{93498}Kaya 1 here.
{93506}{93571}We prepared the stake-out.
{93576}{93675}Kaya1, did you ever apply|for credit at a bank?
{93801}{93841}No, Kaya
{93847}{93921}Well, don't. Because they want to|see a entry in the land register
{93926}{93952}Understood.
{94236}{94321}Go now. C'mon.|-Yes, Sir.
{94597}{94679}Turgay. -Yes, Sir?|-Bring me tea.
{95312}{95356}Kaya 1, Kaya.
{95415}{95459}Kaya, Kaya 1.
{95483}{95559}Just come back home.|-Yes, Sir.
{95737}{95836}He said you shouldn't draw stones,|but beetles, flowers and butterflies
{95839}{95938}You will not get credit if you don't.
{96095}{96175}Here, take the sheets.
{96184}{96217}Alright.
{96254}{96355}Take a big pot, add some tea...
{96366}{96431}...and boil them thoroughly.
{96490}{96542}Just wait. In a minute you will|forget that you are here.
{96545}{96581}How?
{96584}{96651}Just close your eyes and concentrate.
{96654}{96715}We concentrate on women, right?
{96728}{96846}No, later. First we concentrate on|the day of discharge.
{96894}{96993}Or leave.
{97013}{97064}Yes, two men.
{97091}{97119}Flowers.
{97126}{97203}Southwest, they are running.
{97280}{97321}Beetles.
{97390}{97439}We will leave this place.
{97445}{97492}1 50m
{97542}{97687}Think of your families.|Birds chirping. Wind.
{97761}{97876}I see them. They are no scouts.|Let's wait.
{97892}{97991}And other things. You see them,|don't you?
{98001}{98042}A woman.
{98070}{98099}Yes.
{98135}{98168}100m
{98172}{98220}Think of Hlya.
{98225}{98259}80m
{98263}{98319}Think of your warm beds.
{98322}{98376}You aim at the man.|-The sound of water.
{98412}{98452}I take the women.
{98456}{98500}Listen.
{98503}{98545}70m
{98548}{98602}Forget that you are even here.|-Stay calm.
{98607}{98678}You are not here.|-60m
{98682}{98737}A slight breeze.|-Very nice.
{98849}{98880}Quiet.
{98890}{98932}50m
{98988}{99077}You fire when I fire.
{99303}{99402}The girl fell behind the tree. Go, run!
{99407}{99462}Yes, Sir.
{99473}{99522}The boy went down. The girl I don't see.
{99875}{99945}He is dead.
{99967}{100015}Does she have a hand grenade|with her? -No.
{100019}{100100}Maybe under her body.|Have a look. Let's leave.
{100281}{100351}Turgay.|-Yes, Sir.
{100359}{100425}Take his ammo. Turgay.|-Yes, Sir. -Yes, Sir.
{100973}{101017}Kaya 1, Karabal.|-Karabal here.
{101029}{101065}During combat...
{101093}{101147}Wait. Don't report.
{101174}{101244}Commander?|-Take that.
{101249}{101318}Will you return?|-Give me the walkie-talkie.
{101330}{101429}Everythings fine. We return.|-Understood.
{101460}{101501}Take it.
{101652}{101751}Turgay, bundle up our stuff.|-Yes, Sir.
{101809}{101887}What are we going to do with them?
{101931}{102030}They'll come and get the man.|We'll take the girl to the base
{102366}{102450}Serkan. How's her condition?
{102453}{102492}Badly injured.
{102498}{102573}I know. I shot her.|Can you stop the bleeding?
{102576}{102632}Well need the helicopter.
{102638}{102737}Which university did you attend?|-Hacettepe.
{102740}{102790}They have the best medical|department, right?
{102796}{102821}I guess so...
{102825}{102912}So you've been a bad student or|what? Do your job.
{102926}{102983}Turn on the TV.
{102987}{103065}We need the helicopter, commander|-There won't be one.
{103069}{103130}We're not the US Army...
{103133}{103189}..which sends a helicopter|for every single wounded soldier
{103192}{103314}I need to talk to her. There are|things I want to hear from her
{103322}{103421}I am trying to save you.|Bring me a sheet.
{103428}{103527}I'm 21, born in Ankara and|go to college.
{103531}{103593}What's that?
{103613}{103681}How was the day of the contest|for you? Were you excited?
{103687}{103754}Just tell us a little about it.
{103765}{103805}Swab.|-Swab. Swab.
{103887}{103924}Let me have it.
{104324}{104423}Here, grab this. Tighter!
{104438}{104535}I can't watch this.|-Then don't, damn it!
{104581}{104680}There were so many other|beautiful girls.
{104686}{104785}And how does it feel to be the|most beautiful girl of Turkey
{104788}{104831}I am very proud.
{104837}{104904}And I want to represent my|country in the best possible way.
{104908}{104966}How did you get that stunning|body and great looks?
{104969}{105040}I exercise a lot. I am an athlete.
{105044}{105122}I'm on a healthy diet.
{105127}{105192}Every morning an apricot,|a glass of water.
{105200}{105272}That's how I start my day.
{105278}{105327}Is there a part of your body|you don't like?
{105331}{105395}I don't like my neck.
{105400}{105461}What changed in your life|after the contest?
{105472}{105540}It still feels like a dream.
{105544}{105630}Nothing much.|Only more people know me now.
{105660}{105748}Commander I can't concentrate.|Can we turn off the TV?
{105754}{105820}Could you stop the bleeding?|-To some extent.
{105981}{106080}Thank you and again, congratulations.
{106299}{106465}Are you in pain? What a pity.
{106589}{106688}You were there|when Orhan and Emre got killed?
{106815}{106914}Orhan had a wife and two kids|and a new car.
{106962}{107084}Did you watch them die?
{107198}{107297}Did I squeeze to tight?|I'll loosen then. Good.
{107371}{107470}Is there anyone who'll miss you,|when you die?
{107473}{107558}Who'll be sad when you die?
{107563}{107633}Commander youll kill her.
{107712}{107766}Not me.
{107776}{107875}Will the Doctor be sad? Do you know him?
{107888}{107928}Commander.
{107933}{107994}He fucks you, doesn't he?
{108005}{108105}You are going to kill her.|-I'll make this Doctor to show up here.
{108120}{108231}Commander you will kill her.|-Be quiet! What?
{108241}{108340}The Doctor wants to talk to you.
{108364}{108463}Tell him the captain is taking care|of his girlfriend. He's busy right now.
{108475}{108521}Yes, Sir.
{108552}{108635}So you know each other.
{108657}{108756}Where is the doctor?
{108764}{108863}You're going to kill her!
{108880}{108928}Where is the doctor?
{108938}{108978}Commander...
{108983}{109082}Commander! Commander!|You'll kill her! Commander!
{109090}{109149}The Doctor is here.
{109321}{109420}Commander! Commander!
{109449}{109548}Enough!
{109600}{109699}Orhan had a wife and two kids|and a new car.
{109808}{109907}Call the helicopter to take her away.
{109941}{110039}Everybody out! Ilker, Soner, out!
{110042}{110131}Yes, Sir.
{110577}{110609}Turgay.
{110615}{110645}Yes, Sir.
{110651}{110733}You go with the helicopter,|take a few days leave.
{110736}{110835}No, we arrived here together and|we're leaving together.
{111126}{111199}The helicopter is here.
{111203}{111263}The boys shall help you carry her.
{111266}{111303}Yes, Sir.
{111343}{111399}Bring the blanket also.
{111403}{111461}Yes, Sir.
{111906}{111965}Let her down, slowly.
{112000}{112064}Let me have it.
{112121}{112161}Sit down.
{114478}{114577}Citizens heatedly protested|against the terror of the PKK.
{114600}{114655}It takes 57 second.
{114688}{114755}What takes 57 seconds?
{114775}{114912}Commander said we would get|45 seconds. But it took 57.
{114939}{115004}General Gres is ordered to|lead the examination...
{115017}{115093}... in Diyarbakir in the southeast|of the country.
{115230}{115351}Don't shed tears, you beauty.
{115367}{115481}Don't hurt yourself, beauty.
{115540}{115632}What does this mean in Turkish?
{115647}{115746}Don't shed tears,|don't hurt yourself, beauty.
{115752}{115814}What shall I do, I love you.
{115818}{115902}I can't cope with my feelings.
{115912}{115980}Do you have a girlfriend?
{115990}{116030}Yes, in the village.
{116034}{116079}What's her name?|-Xece.
{116090}{116120}What?!|-Xece.
{116123}{116175}What's that supposed to mean?|-Hatice in Kurdish.
{116179}{116315}My heart. My only one, my flower.
{116338}{116387}Beloved.
{116409}{116483}I am too far away to say I'm sorry.
{116641}{116740}I wished my breath to be in your face.
{116799}{116898}I'd love to warm your back|with my breath.
{116983}{117071}If only I could whisper the|sweetest love songs in your ear
{117130}{117174}Muzzle into the can!
{117178}{117283}I couldn't, my love.|I was ashamed of these words.
{117353}{117489}My hands caressed your hands,|my lips caressed your neck...
{117497}{117526}Be careful.
{117567}{117646}My eyes, your heart...
{117650}{117757}.. where the sun hides.
{117815}{117923}I always thought the clouds would disappear,|if I would only stare bravely enough at them.
{117972}{118100}I can't change this. Too late.
{118134}{118258}Don't be angry.|A cloud concealed my view.
{118277}{118348}I couldn't help it...
{118465}{118549}I became that cloud.
{118565}{118651}I made it rain in your innermost.
{118734}{118760}Forgive me.
{118859}{118958}I didn't have enough breath|to chase the clouds away.
{118980}{119047}I seem to hear your voice...
{119076}{119175}In my most unprotected moment|I will take your curse.
{119230}{119279}I will ask for forgiveness.
{119485}{119584}My breath was supposed to|give life to yours. I couldn't.
{119623}{119722}I was out of breath.
{119725}{119743}Come.
{119773}{119833}Your medication.
{119903}{120002}I don't need them anymore.|Throw them away.
{120017}{120116}I wished so hard that this breath would be|enough to swallow the love in your chest
{120126}{120192}It wasn't supposed to be that way.
{120205}{120304}I wasn't able to tell you the|fairy tales of my childhood.
{120343}{120442}I would have loved to carry you|away with my fairy tales!
{120496}{120595}Once upon a time... was all I said.
{120619}{120697}Hello? Hello?
{121654}{121725}Kaya, I will avenge the death of my comrade.|-Then come
{121728}{121799}I'll revenge the woman.|-I'll have revenge too.
{121802}{121854}I will raise a statue for her there.
{121857}{121915}Come here, act like a man.|-I'll come soon.
{121918}{121973}I won't leave this place without|having seen you first. You coward.
{121976}{122032}Would a coward fight for 10 years?
{122036}{122096}You live like a boar in the mountains.
{122099}{122162}You killed thousands of youth!|You murderers!
{122165}{122220}We fight against the leeches|that dwell among your own people
{122223}{122287}Did you manage to defeat them|in all these years?
{122290}{122351}You are one who kills his own people.
{122354}{122422}Don't speak out the name of|my people, who you suppress.
{122425}{122480}You were suppressed? What is it,|that this state didn't give?
{122483}{122586}My freedom! You banned my|people from their own land.
{122589}{122687}You don't gain freedom through murder.|-You outlawed my language
{122690}{122742}You went to university in this country!
{122745}{122796}Be patient. I will free you of|all your worries.
{122799}{122848}You are a murderer.|-In fact you are the murderer.
{122851}{122949}What about the teachers, children,|engineers, workers you've killed.
{122952}{123031}This land is tough, this war has rules.
{123034}{123094}You have a rule for killing children?
{123097}{123154}How many villages did you burn down?
{123157}{123224}The blood of the innocent|villagers is on your hands!
{123227}{123318}You never understood us. It is your fault|that poverty became the fate of my people
{123321}{123378}Has every poor man become a|terrorist, like you?
{123381}{123439}This is our land.|-Doctor, this land belongs to us all.
{123442}{123482}These mountains are mine. Off you go!
{123486}{123538}This place shall become your grave.|-Off you go.
{123541}{123605}Not without seeing you first.|-Go to your wife.
{123608}{123652}I'll stay here, Doctor.|-Go.
{123655}{123717}I'm going to kill you.|-You will die here.
{123722}{123808}So long live Motherland!
{123934}{124014}I want you to give that to Zeynep.
{124017}{124063}Commander.
{124077}{124135}This is not an order.|I ask you to do it.
{124343}{124426}I don't think I'll survive the combat.
{124437}{124520}I feel it since Orhan died.
{124649}{124732}I can't accept his death.
{124820}{124919}But you've been in so many combats!
{125081}{125180}I never told Zeynep|how much she means to me.
{125208}{125267}I was ashamed.
{125292}{125414}We are soldiers. Unromantic.|Nothing for me.
{125484}{125583}I wasn't able to say I LOVE YOU.
{125672}{125734}I love you...
{125801}{125900}How hard to say are these 8 letters?
{125912}{125998}Good god.... 8 letters.
{126213}{126295}Everything's black, Baris.
{126373}{126444}I don't find answers to|my questions anymore.
{126479}{126555}I remain here without answers.
{126592}{126691}Without Zeynep, without Orhan.
{126759}{126882}Nothing makes sense and|I don't find words for it.
{127028}{127127}How can I explain that I have as much love|for Ankara, as I have for the mountains here
{127247}{127314}Anyway...
{127442}{127548}Don't you wonder what's the|medication for I take?
{127601}{127694}We can't have children.
{127727}{127798}I'm bleeding on the inside.
{127891}{127965}Give this to her.
{128129}{128247}Tell her, I smell her scent|whenever I see flowers.
{128260}{128341}And... I want her to forgive me.
{128385}{128484}Could you deliver additional ammunition?
{128586}{128685}Good, I'll keep you updated.
{129658}{129757}Sir, yes Sir. Commander.
{130023}{130122}All nights in this place are short...
{130174}{130235}...except one.
{130280}{130369}You pray to make it end.
{130388}{130487}You don't have a chance to think|about why you're here.
{130616}{130715}You just want to survive the night,|still breathing.
{130864}{130963}If I stop breathing, you do too.
{131050}{131122}Do you deserve your breath?
{131161}{131260}I don't know. Commander, l...|-Keep silent!
{131364}{131484}You guys sent me here.|The Turkish soldier is the bravest
{131548}{131602}Martyrs never die, no one will|ever divide this country.
{131752}{131844}My uncle shouted this.
{131856}{131898}My aunt did.
{131929}{132025}Neighbours. You.
{132085}{132156}And I came.
{132251}{132359}This is war. Either you are a|murderer or a victim.
{132372}{132447}In between there's only dishonour.
{132468}{132567}Do you think, I don't know that|we can't win this war like that?
{132623}{132698}Do you think I'm stupid?
{132785}{132859}I know that.
{132881}{132999}What you don't know is that|if I fail here,
{133087}{133179}you lose in Istanbul and Ankara|as well. Do you get that?
{133396}{133495}You don't.|Nobody is ever right at war
{133524}{133616}You don't ask yourself|in the longest night...
{133627}{133743}...who is right or wrong, murderer|or victim.
{133853}{133997}There is only your breath.|You breath in or out.
{134011}{134110}That simple. You get that?
{134363}{134462}If you would've only liked me a little.
{134613}{134712}Sleep now.
{135092}{135187}Don't worry. Every war has|got an end. Even this one.
{135240}{135339}At the end you'll judge me.
{135371}{135470}That doesn't matter.
{135480}{135548}There is no other place for me|to turn to.
{136104}{136196}Damn kiosk owner!
{136240}{136325}Is the captain asleep?
{136423}{136522}Sergeant, I need to call Gksen.

{168053}{168120}When I said "my life for my country"...
{168144}{168227}... my heart screamed|"you are my home!".
{168333}{168432}I became your grave|while trying to be your soil.
{168479}{168578}A trickle instead of your river.
{168641}{168740}Instead of being your sun|I became your shadow.
{168896}{168967}Forgive me, my love...
{169139}{169213}Why didn't I listen to your soul?
{169238}{169330}Listened with my eyes,|see with my heart?
{169367}{169466}Why did I hide my heart|when you reached out for it.
{169546}{169645}If only my tears could rest|on my cheek without shame.
{169732}{169831}My love, I take you with me.
{169948}{170047}How cruel, to be the cloud|in your heart.
{170130}{170229}To devour the light of the|morning forever.
{170328}{170427}Winds! Help me!
{170566}{170686}I hope that one sunny day|a stronger love finds its path...
{170723}{170801}...and I fly away.
{170889}{170988}Then I will scream a thousand times
{170996}{171053}I love you.
{176408}{176507}I'm unemployed. Why do you hit me?
{176519}{176604}This love should not end like this.
