1
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,970
<i>...what has turned into a
classic Formula 1 season.</i>

2
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,949
<i>...with the weather
conditions so uncertain,</i>

3
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,350
<i>the drivers prepare for...</i>

4
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,629
<i>...the track is still
dangerously wet,</i>

5
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,949
<i>but following a drivers meeting,
a decision has been taken.</i>

6
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,620
<i>Three minutes to go.
Everybody off the grid now.</i>

7
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,869
<i>25 drivers start every
season in Formula 1,</i>

8
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,960
<i>and each year, two of us die.</i>

9
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,119
<i>What kind of person
does a job like this?</i>

10
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,659
<i>Not normal men, for sure.</i>

11
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,799
<i>Rebels,</i>

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,159
<i>lunatics,</i>

13
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,830
<i>dreamers.</i>

14
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,699
<i>People who are desperate
to make a Mark</i>

15
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,000
<i>and are prepared to die trying.</i>

16
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,739
<i>My name is Niki Lauda,</i>

17
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,939
<i>and racing people know
me for two things.</i>

18
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,110
<i>The first is my
rivalry with him.</i>

19
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,719
What about Hunt? Has he changed?

20
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,259
No, he's going on wets.

21
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,229
<i>I don't know why it
became such a big thing.</i>

22
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,769
<i>We were just drivers busting
each other's balls.</i>

23
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,969
<i>To me this is perfectly normal,</i>

24
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,199
<i>but other people saw
it differently,</i>

25
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,700
<i>that whatever it was
between us went deeper.</i>

26
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,789
<i>The other thing I'm
remembered for</i>

27
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,459
<i>is what happened on
1st August 1976,</i>

28
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,520
<i>when I was chasing
him like an asshole.</i>

29
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,899
Yeah, that's the one. On the
second shelf. Thank you.

30
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,129
Trauma trolley, please.

31
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,829
I think the racetrack telephoned
ahead that I was coming.

32
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,670
Hunt. James Hunt.

33
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,709
What's the matter? No one ever
seen a spot of blood before?

34
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,470
- Are you all right?
- Absolutely fine.

35
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,469
We all thought you'd
been in an accident.

36
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,549
I have.

37
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,229
If you call a
friendly disagreement

38
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,750
with another driver an accident.

39
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,999
What did you disagree about?

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,860
It's none of your business.

41
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,860
Sorry.

42
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,730
His wife.

43
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,739
That's going to need a
couple of stitches.

44
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,039
- It's a nasty cut.
- It was a nasty blow.

45
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,140
Done with a bloody crowbar.

46
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,779
- Why? What did you do?
- Nothing.

47
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,440
Only what she asked me to do.

48
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,850
Which was...?

49
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,450
I'd be happy to show
you if you like.

50
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,859
Sorry.

51
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,669
<i>I have a theory why women
like racing drivers.</i>

52
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,439
<i>It's not because they
respect what we do,</i>

53
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,939
<i>driving round and
round in circles.</i>

54
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,909
<i>Mostly they think
that's pathetic</i>

55
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,939
<i>and they're probably right.</i>

56
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,430
<i>It's our closeness to death.</i>

57
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,479
<i>The closer you are to death,
the more alive you feel.</i>

58
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,089
<i>The more alive you are. And
they can see that in you.</i>

59
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,080
<i>They feel that in you.</i>

60
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,029
<i>My name is James Hunt.</i>

61
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,159
<i>My father is a stockbroker,</i>

62
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,259
<i>my sister is a barrister</i>

63
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,869
<i>and my brother is an accountant.</i>

64
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,419
<i>And I,</i>

65
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,950
<i>well, I do this.</i>

66
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,709
<i>It's a wonderful way to live.
It's the only way to drive.</i>

67
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,510
<i>As if each day is your last.</i>

68
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,059
I've never been to a
Grand Prix before.

69
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,719
You still haven't.

70
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,630
- This is Formula 3.
- What's that?

71
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,459
That's a lower division,

72
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,229
where idiots like me mess about

73
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,599
in the hop of being
talent-spotted to race in F1.

74
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,769
- You look disappointed.
- No.

75
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,939
You only slept with me because
you thought I was famous.

76
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,640
That's not true!

77
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,449
Don't worry. I will be one day.

78
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,849
Morning, everyone.

79
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,820
- This is Nursie.
- Gemma.

80
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,119
Nursie, this is Bubbles
Horsely, team manager.

81
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,649
How do you do?

82
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,189
- Bubbles?
- Yeah.

83
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,489
Doc Postlethwaite, our designer.

84
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,859
How do you do?

85
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,490
And Alexander, Lord
Hesketh, the team's owner.

86
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,430
How do you do?

87
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,229
Fine, thanks.

88
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,539
Well done, Superstar!

89
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,839
- That's the car?
- Yep, that's her.

90
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,240
Lotus 59.

91
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,439
1000cc. Cosworth Mae engine.

92
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,640
She's no beauty, but
goes like the slappers.

93
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,089
Nothing to be worried about.
Does it before every race.

94
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,729
Good sign, actually.
Means he's stoked.

95
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,429
All Formula 3 cars to
the assembly area.

96
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,830
Now, please.

97
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,970
...drivers please bring them
to the scrutineering bay now.

98
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,509
All right, Superstar?

99
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,079
Never better, patron.

100
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,550
- Have a gargle with this.
- Thank you.

101
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,589
Quick toke of this.

102
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,889
At Crystal Palace today,
James Hunt's on pole,

103
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,459
with Austrian newcomer
Niki Lauda alongside him

104
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,199
and Dave Walker
completing Row 1.

105
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,129
Row 2 is Mike Beuttler
and Dave Morgan,

106
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,899
with Tony Trimmer
and Gerry Birrell.

107
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,039
Who's that?

108
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,090
He's new.

109
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,630
- Some German.
- Austrian.

110
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,909
He's been here since 5 a.m.
walking the track.

111
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,649
You might actually have to
concentrate today, James.

112
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,380
You'll need these.

113
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,720
Okay, start her up.

114
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,730
Ah! What music!

115
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,759
They could never
have imagined it,

116
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,189
those pioneers who
invented the automobile,

117
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,159
that it would possess
us like this,

118
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,729
in our imaginations, our dreams.

119
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,229
Nursie, men love women,

120
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,199
but even more than that,

121
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,790
men love cars!

122
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,910
- Come on, James!
- It's James! Go on, James!

123
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,150
Go, James!

124
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,029
<i>Hunt's still in the lead,</i>

125
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,720
<i>but Niki Lauda is
right on his tail!</i>

126
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,039
<i>Hunt and Lauda are proving to
be in a class of their own.</i>

127
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,169
<i>They're leaving the
pack far behind.</i>

128
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,730
Herr Red Devil's on his tail.

129
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,950
<i>Lauda takes a look
down the inside...</i>

130
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,710
<i>...and he's sold him a dummy!</i>

131
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,129
<i>Lauda is through!
He's in the lead!</i>

132
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,580
<i>Hunt will be determined to
make up for that mistake.</i>

133
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,169
<i>Hunt's in Lauda's slipstream.</i>

134
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,770
<i>Lauda's not leaving any gap.</i>

135
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,109
<i>The Lotus goes for the inside.</i>

136
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,410
<i>It's an aggressive
move from Hunt.</i>

137
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,380
<i>There's contact!</i>

138
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,769
<i>The leaders have spun out!
Lauda's facing the wrong way!</i>

139
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,030
<i>The back marker's gone through!</i>

140
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,739
<i>You can see why Hunter's
fellow drivers call him.</i>

141
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,470
<i>"Hunt the Shunt."</i>

142
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,909
Asshole!

143
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,849
- Go on, James!
- The Kraut's out of it!

144
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,779
<i>Lauda is clearly furious.</i>

145
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,979
<i>There's every reason to expect
sharp words in the pit.</i>

146
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,219
<i>It's going to be
victory for Hunt.</i>

147
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,710
<i>It's going to be an ignominious
defeat for Niki Lauda.</i>

148
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,559
<i>So James Hunt scores his
third major Formula 3 win</i>

149
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,699
<i>of the season here,
at Crystal Palace,</i>

150
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,539
<i>after a desperate
battle with Niki Lauda.</i>

151
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,539
<i>Lauda was unable so restart</i>

152
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,439
<i>after Hunt's aggressive move
caused them both to spin out</i>

153
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,739
<i>in the last lap of the race.</i>

154
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,579
Hard luck. Better
luck next time.

155
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,700
Hey, asshole!

156
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,879
That was my line. I
had that corner.

157
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,649
You mean the one
that you spun out of

158
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,489
and finished facing
the other way?

159
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,259
I think that corner had you.

160
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,989
That move was total suicide.
What if I hadn't braked?

161
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,729
- We'd have crashed.
- But we didn't, did we?

162
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,960
Thanks to your impeccable
survival instincts.

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,230
Fuck you! What's your name?

164
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,900
James Simon Wallis Hunt.

165
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,539
Remember it, my
little Jerry friend.

166
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,639
- Jawohl! Remember ze name.
- It's very simple.

167
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,979
Hunt, it rhymes with cunt!

168
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,240
A word that happens to
describe you perfectly.

169
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,849
Who was that?

170
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,150
I've no idea. He looks
like a rat, doesn't he?

171
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,219
<i>In my hometown, Vienna,</i>

172
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,529
<i>my family's famous
for one thing:</i>

173
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,650
<i>Business.</i>

174
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,659
<i>My grandfather was
a businessman,</i>

175
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,220
<i>my father, too.</i>

176
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,129
<i>So when they heard I wanted
to race cars for a living,</i>

177
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,000
<i>They are a few things to say.</i>

178
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,860
Good.

179
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,519
<i>So if my family wasn't
going to help me,</i>

180
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,059
<i>I decided to risk everything
and take out a Loan myself.</i>

181
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,989
<i>I found a Formula 1
team with an Ok car</i>

182
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,299
<i>and an owner who had
run out of money</i>

183
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,629
<i>and was willing to
accept my terms.</i>

184
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,669
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

185
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,469
I'm delighted to say...

186
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,139
that the winner of the Guild
of Motoring Writers Award.

187
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,439
Driver of the Year...

188
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,840
is James Hunt.

189
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,570
Superb news!

190
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,610
- Well done, James.
- Superstar!

191
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,980
Fantastic!

192
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,519
- Well done.
- Thank you so much.

193
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,659
Yes!

194
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,960
My parents always wanted
me to be a doctor

195
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,199
or a stockbroker or something.
They gave me

196
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,469
the first-class education, but
that went all terribly wrong

197
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,900
and I ended up with you lot.

198
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,970
Thank you. I need it
more than you do.

199
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,109
I mean, I have a hot head,

200
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,179
an inability to
tolerate discipline...

201
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,879
- Yes!
- Very true!

202
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,479
I fall out with people
left and right.

203
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,489
The only creatures
I've ever really loved

204
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,980
or treated honorably
are budgerigars.

205
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,729
So in any normal area of
life, I'd be, or I am,

206
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,229
a total liability.

207
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,699
The only thing I've got going
for me is I'm quick in a car.

208
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,829
So thank you for this and
for acknowledging that.

209
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,699
I'm going to give
it to my father

210
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,169
and tell him to put
it on the mantelpiece

211
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,100
and imagine it's a first-class
degree in medicine.

212
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,519
Well done, Superstar.

213
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,859
Another season like that,

214
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,259
I'll move you up
to the big time.

215
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,029
Come on, you don't
think I'm ready now?

216
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,259
You are.

217
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,599
I'm not. I've got to
find you a car first.

218
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,199
Well, go on, then.

219
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,899
Chop chop. Don't wait too long.

220
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,599
You don't want him to
do what Lauda just did.

221
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,539
- Why? What did he do?
- Got himself a drive, with BRM.

222
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,639
How the hell did he do that?
He's a nobody.

223
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,009
He's never won a bloody thing.

224
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,109
Apparently, took out a
Loan and bought his way in

225
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,979
with two million
Austrian shillings.

226
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,140
Jesus.

227
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,599
Niki Lauda.

228
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,160
Here for pre-season testing.
BRM?

229
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,440
Sign the release form. I'll
let them know you're here.

230
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,519
- Mr. Stanley.
- Good morning.

231
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,450
- Good morning.
- Clay!

232
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,119
Let me introduce you to
our number one driver.

233
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,890
Clay Regazzoni.

234
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,490
- How are you?
- Good.

235
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,969
Pleasure.

236
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,529
And these are your mechanics.

237
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,060
They're reporting
exclusively to you,

238
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,009
as per contract.

239
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,109
Pleasure.

240
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,540
- Do you wanna see the car')
- Sure.

241
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,240
Hello.

242
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,080
There she is. P160.

243
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,380
- Same as Regazzoni's?
- Identical in every detail.

244
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,489
How much does she weigh?

245
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,059
- 600 kilos.
- But that's crazy.

246
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,759
- Why so heavy?
- It's a V12 engine.

247
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,829
That lump weighs
190K on its own.

248
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,800
Okay.

249
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,469
What horsepower are you getting?

250
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,069
- No, no, 450.
- It's not enough.

251
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,509
It needs to be 500.

252
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,139
And the engine needs to be.

253
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,979
- We already tried.
- Tried what?

254
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,979
Everything

255
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,479
We replaced the entire
exhaust system.

256
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,080
- Barely made the difference.
- Are you using magnesium parts?

257
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,229
Now the engine block.

258
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,169
Any mounting or fixing
plates, strip it out also.

259
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,599
When you've done that,

260
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,539
we have to look at
the aerodynamics,

261
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,230
front and rear wing.

262
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,790
Okay, thank you. Good night.

263
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,080
What was Regazzoni's time?

264
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,689
1:53.

265
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,989
Okay, now put him in my car and
he'll go 2 seconds faster.

266
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,960
- Well, that's impossible.
- No chance.

267
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,099
We've been working
on it all night.

268
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,569
Put Regazzoni in the car.
See what happens.

269
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,029
I don't understand. Why
am I supposed to do this?

270
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,039
I don't know, Clay.

271
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,530
He wants you to
take it for a spin.

272
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,930
Gloves, please.

273
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,519
- I'd say we push it...
- All right.

274
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,789
What did you do to the car?

275
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,629
That's information
I'll share with you

276
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,589
under certain conditions only.

277
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,620
Go on.

278
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,869
A guaranteed place in the team.

279
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,569
And a paid contract
on equal terms

280
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,869
with Regazzoni for two years.

281
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,399
Are you crazy?

282
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,769
Clay's a senior figure in F1.

283
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,439
You're just a rookie!

284
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,109
The only reason we took you on
is because you're paying us.

285
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,479
Well, as of now, if
you want me to stay,

286
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,979
we rip up the contract,
I don't pay you a cent.

287
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,819
That's outrageous!

288
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,080
Was he quicker in my car?

289
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,520
He was, wasn't he?

290
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,610
Did he go two seconds faster?

291
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,390
Two point three.

292
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,669
So, have a think,

293
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,800
work out your priorities
and get back to me.

294
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,150
Hey, Niki.

295
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,089
I know what you're going to say,
that it's none of my business.

296
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,060
What?

297
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,830
If it's the track manager you're
taking on your date tonight.

298
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,539
It's none of your business.

299
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,769
Okay, but if you want my advice,

300
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,570
I'd let this one go.

301
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,700
I'm not questioning your taste.
She is a great girl, but...

302
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,909
Agnes' last boyfriend

303
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,079
was a British Formula 2 driver

304
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,489
who has a reputation
for two things,

305
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,049
for being a little
crazy on the track...

306
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,789
and for going all
night and all day

307
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,489
and all night again in bed.
He's a good driver,

308
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,859
but an immortal fuck apparently.

309
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,799
I don't know about you,
but that's not an act

310
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,820
I'd like to follow.

311
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,600
But if that doesn't
bother you...

312
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,700
What's his name, the driver?

313
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,410
Hunt. James Hunt.

314
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,479
You see, you share information

315
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
and I share information.

316
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,120
That's what teammates are for.

317
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,800
- Where the hell are we going?
- I promise it'll be worth it.

318
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,939
Just keep them closed.

319
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,130
Wait for it.

320
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,610
Wait for it.

321
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,549
There.

322
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,810
What do you say?

323
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,710
She's Formula 1.

324
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,219
Yes, she is, Superstar.

325
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,159
Your brother and I got together
with the bean counters.

326
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,219
And since the economics
of F1 are not

327
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,929
so significantly different
to the economics of F2,

328
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,829
well, we thought if we were
going to be losing money,

329
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,969
we might as well be doing it on
the big roulette table in F1.

330
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:54,230
You fat, little, inbred beauty.
Come here.

331
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,179
Actually, credit where it's
due, we got the idea from Niki.

332
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,779
- Who?
- Lauda.

333
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,179
Bought his way in
rather than mess about

334
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,579
in the lower divisions.
I thought

335
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,879
"Bloody hell, he's right."

336
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,789
No sponsorship, Superstar.

337
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,149
I hope you approve.

338
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,880
No vulgar logos for
cigarettes or condoms.

339
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,689
Just plain white with the flags.

340
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,750
And racing overalls

341
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,890
which read

342
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,160
"Sex. Breakfast of champions."

343
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,130
So when do we start?

344
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,909
- Soon as you're ready.
- Ready?

345
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,570
I've been waiting for
this my whole life.

346
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,810
VILLAGE OF WATKINS GLEN

347
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,759
<i>When the season started,
people wondered</i>

348
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,629
<i>whether Lord Hesketh
and his team</i>

349
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,029
<i>of upper-class enthusiasts
were bringing glamour</i>

350
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,830
<i>to the racing community
or just comedy.</i>

351
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,569
<i>Certainly it was the first
time anyone had seen</i>

352
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,700
<i>a Butler sewing oysters
and caviar in the pits.</i>

353
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,869
<i>But they have made
quite an impact.</i>

354
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,479
<i>6th in France, 4th in
Britain and 3rd in Holland.</i>

355
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,609
<i>All drivers on the track,
caution flags are out.</i>

356
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,149
<i>A severe crash at the Esses.</i>

357
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,589
<i>Red flag. There's a
car off the track.</i>

358
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,589
<i>And reports are reaching
me that there's been</i>

359
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,819
<i>a serious accident
in qualifying.</i>

360
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,029
<i>The identity of the driver
we don't currently have,</i>

361
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,899
<i>but as you can tell from
all the activity going on</i>

362
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,629
<i>towards the track, it was clearly
a grave incident indeed.</i>

363
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,199
<i>We will, of course, have more
information as we get it,</i>

364
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,660
<i>but it is the sight and sound
of F1 nobody likes to see.</i>

365
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,670
- Get your hands off me!
- Hey, come on!

366
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,559
<i>Drivers of top stature we've
lost just in the past 4 seasons</i>

367
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,750
<i>have included Piers Courage,</i>

368
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,120
<i>Jochen Rindt,</i>

369
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,190
<i>Jo Siffert,</i>

370
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,599
<i>Roger Williamson</i>

371
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,739
<i>and today, at Watkins Glen,</i>

372
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,640
<i>Formula 1 has claimed
another driver.</i>

373
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,669
<i>The Tyrrell team have
withdrawn from the race.</i>

374
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,979
<i>Their places on the grid
will be left empty.</i>

375
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,649
- Terrible.
- They should cancel the race.

376
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,630
Why?

377
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,149
He made a mistake, went
into the corner too fast.

378
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,519
It's his fault.

379
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,749
- Is that right?
- It's obvious.

380
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,819
Look at the tyre marks.

381
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,159
So says the nobody, who had
to pay for his own drive.

382
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,089
How's that working out
for you, by the way?

383
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,190
Fine.

384
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,629
How is it at the back?

385
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,100
Not planning on being
there for long.

386
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,800
Ten minutes to the warm-up lap.
Ten minutes.

387
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,230
Arsehole.

388
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,279
<i>Heading into the Grand Hotel
hairpin, second gear.</i>

389
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,279
<i>Turn in hard, looking
for late apex,</i>

390
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,940
<i>gentle with the bar.</i>

391
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,089
<i>Heading into Portier,
second gear,</i>

392
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,419
<i>clip the apex,</i>

393
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,159
<i>light brake, stay in second,</i>

394
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,059
<i>looking for a good exit.</i>

395
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,999
<i>Heading through the
tunnel, gradual right,</i>

396
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,959
<i>up through third,
fourth, fifth...</i>

397
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,800
ls Alexander around?

398
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,560
Yes, he was.

399
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,109
He went back to the
house to take a call.

400
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,809
He'll be back shortly.

401
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,809
He only wanted to show
me his pride and Joy.

402
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,509
Rhymes with 'boy' if you ask me.

403
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,770
And 'toy.'

404
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,219
God, it's so flimsy.

405
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,819
For something that
costs so much.

406
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,520
There's no comfort, no
protection, nothing.

407
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,559
No, it's just a little
coffin, really.

408
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,460
Surrounded by high-octane
fuel in here.

409
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,460
Being driven round 170 mph.

410
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:47,100
To all intents and purposes,
this thing's a bomb on wheels.

411
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,930
You're James, aren't you?

412
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,240
Yes.

413
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,610
You fit the description.

414
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,210
Is that right?

415
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,519
Suzy. Friend of Alex's.

416
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,710
Yeah, yeah.

417
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,780
I know exactly.

418
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,059
What was the description?

419
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,719
Mostly positive in
terms of appearance.

420
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,929
Negative only in
terms of character.

421
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,390
I've been told to avoid you.

422
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,790
By whom?

423
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,699
Alexander.

424
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,729
He says you're a bad boy.

425
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,839
Alexander doesn't know
what he's talking about.

426
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,899
I was. I'm not anymore.

427
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,969
The new me is very professional.

428
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,709
Early to bed, early to rise.

429
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,040
All very dull,

430
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,879
but according to the team,

431
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,009
the best way to keep beating
the goose stepper.'

432
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,949
Is that what you were
doing when I came in?

433
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,889
Yes, visualization techniques,
memorising the circuit,

434
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,620
in this case Monaco,
which is up next.

435
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,929
Personally I've always
been a great believer

436
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,859
in getting there on the
day, putting my foot down

437
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,090
and playing chicken
with everyone else.

438
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,169
But they don't want me
doing that anymore.

439
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:58,800
They want my body like a Temple
and my mind like a monk.

440
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,139
And what about your
soul, your heart?

441
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,540
They've got ideas
about that, too.

442
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,119
They want me to stop
messing around,

443
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,449
settle down, get married with
the next nice girl I meet.

444
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,649
They think that'd
be good for me.

445
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,159
What do you think?

446
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,180
It sounds fucking awful.

447
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,199
But sine they're right
about most things,

448
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,660
they're probably right
about that too.

449
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,900
You don't fancy getting
married, do you?

450
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,930
Suzy.

451
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,490
JUST MARRIED

452
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Hey, hey, hey!

453
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,709
- What's going on with him?
- Nothing. Nothing.

454
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,709
Didn't want to ruin your day.

455
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,830
It's...

456
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,610
- it's the Kraut.
- What about him?

457
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,809
He's just been
signed by Ferrari.

458
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,680
You're kidding me?

459
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,849
Jesus. How did that happen?

460
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,649
Did he buy his way in there too?

461
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,519
Well, the old man
took Regazzoni back

462
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,729
and he insisted
on it apparently.

463
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,920
He says that Niki's a
genius setting up the cars.

464
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,840
FERRARI TEST TRACK
FIORANO, ITALY

465
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,679
It's terrible.
Drives like a pig.

466
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,589
- You can't say that.
- Why not?

467
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,089
- It's a Ferrari!
- It's a shitbox!

468
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,119
It understeers like crazy
and the weight distribution

469
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,589
is a disaster.

470
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,989
It's amazing, all
these facilities

471
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,430
and you make a piece
of crap like this.

472
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,629
"Ferrari family,"

473
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,429
"our good friend
Clay Regazzoni."

474
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,759
You are family and friend
to the commendatore

475
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,099
as long as you win.

476
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,699
The minute you
don't, ciao, ciao.

477
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,199
I totally understand.

478
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,599
It's business.

479
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,009
I would do the same.

480
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,209
But it isn't just
business, is it?

481
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,839
What we do. It's passion, love.

482
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,809
Which is why we are prepared
to risk our lives for it.

483
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,849
Not me.

484
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,019
If I had more talent and
could earn better money

485
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,489
with something else, I would.

486
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,489
How do you know you
will make money here?

487
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,159
You haven't yet.

488
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,350
Not yet, but I will.

489
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,520
If you can, I can.

490
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,700
You know, are you
ever not an asshole?

491
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,039
- Why am I an asshole?
- Well...

492
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,609
By now I'm both quicker than you
and better at setting up a car.

493
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,879
You can't deal with it,
so you're the asshole.

494
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,140
Screw you.

495
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,919
I brought you along today

496
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,949
because you seem like
a lonely kind of guy.

497
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,119
I thought if I introduced
you to some nice people,

498
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,819
that could rub off on you.

499
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,989
Forget it.

500
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,629
Make your own friends.

501
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,059
Come on, Clay.

502
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,460
I'm sorry.

503
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,630
Are you leaving?

504
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,470
Yes.

505
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,969
Can you give me a lift
to the nearest town,

506
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,500
anywhere with a train station?

507
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,880
Sure.

508
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,809
Trento's half an hour's drive.

509
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,840
Get in.

510
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,539
What are you doing?

511
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,609
You hear that noise
when you accelerate?

512
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,879
- No.
- Your fan belt is loose.

513
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,110
My What?

514
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,149
And when you brake, your
foot goes all the way down,

515
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,989
which means there's
air in the system.

516
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,150
- Anything else?
- No.

517
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,820
Apart from the rear
brakes are worn out,

518
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,089
the front right
tyre is a bit soft,

519
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,690
which explains why
you're weaving so much.

520
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,729
How can you tell?

521
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,599
- My ass.
- Sorry?

522
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,799
God gave me an Ok mind,

523
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,839
but a really good ass which
can feel everything in a car.

524
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,469
You don't know what
you're talking about.

525
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,939
This car is fine. I just
had a service a week ago.

526
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,009
Not a good one.

527
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,879
Yes, a very good
one, very expensive.

528
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,440
This car's as good as new.
Relax.

529
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:51,059
- You're not in a hurry, are you?
- No.

530
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,890
As long as I'm back in
Maranello Monday morning.

531
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,500
Yes.

532
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,249
- Actually, we do, yeah.
- It's my honor, Niki.

533
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,719
- Thank you.
- My car is your car.

534
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,659
On one condition, though.

535
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,689
It's a piece of shit.
It's dog shit.

536
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,680
But if you drive it, you
make my life, Niki, eh?

537
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,009
Would someone please
tell me what's going on?

538
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,950
- Who are you? Should I know you?
- What, you don't know?

539
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,919
He's Niki Lauda,
Formula 1 driver,

540
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,749
and he just signed with Ferrari.

541
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,089
- Him?
- Yes.

542
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,089
- Impossible.
- Why?

543
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,589
Well, you know,
Formula 1 drivers,

544
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,799
they have long hair, are sexy...

545
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,729
their shins are open to here.

546
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,429
- Thank you.
- Yes.

547
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:14,770
Anyway, look at the way he's
driving, like an old man.

548
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,909
There's no need to drive fast.

549
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,609
It just increases the
percentage of risk.

550
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,779
We're not in a hurry.
I'm not being paid.

551
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,549
Right now, with zero
incentive or reward,

552
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,540
why would I drive fast?

553
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,520
Because I'm asking you to.

554
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,019
<i>This is an incredible
battle between Niki Lauda</i>

555
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,459
<i>in the red Ferrari
and James Hunt</i>

556
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,430
<i>in the white Hesketh.</i>

557
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,929
<i>...the challenge
of Niki Lauda...</i>

558
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:50,969
<i>Lauda attacking Hunt. He
gets through on the inside.</i>

559
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,769
<i>Goes wide at the exit.</i>

560
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,239
<i>Hunt is past again.</i>

561
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,509
<i>Once more, Lauda tries
to sneak up the inside.</i>

562
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,879
<i>They're absolutely side
by side, wheel to wheel.</i>

563
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,839
<i>So evenly matched.</i>

564
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,709
<i>Fantastic battle between
these two great drivers.</i>

565
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,940
<i>Hunt is now ahead once more.</i>

566
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,089
<i>But Lauda's coming
back again now.</i>

567
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,949
<i>Lauda once more
sneaks up the inside.</i>

568
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,959
<i>And again he runs wide.
Again the Hesketh...</i>

569
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,150
- Suzy, we're ready, come on.
- Just one second.

570
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,390
- Can we go, yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

571
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,969
<i>We're in the closing laps of
this race at Watkins Glen.</i>

572
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,830
<i>They come down the hill.</i>

573
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,509
<i>And Hunt's got a problem!</i>

574
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,969
<i>Hunt pulls across to the left!</i>

575
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,810
<i>Lauda goes ahead on his own.</i>

576
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,809
<i>A sad end to a wonderful battle.</i>

577
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:43,510
<i>Hunt pushing off the marshal.</i>

578
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,629
<i>The chequered flag
is waiting for Lauda</i>

579
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,060
<i>and for Ferrari!</i>

580
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,469
<i>The title going to Niki Lauda,</i>

581
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,869
<i>who wins the race,</i>

582
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:05,100
<i>who wins the World Championship.</i>

583
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,640
Do I look like a
racing driver now?

584
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,680
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

585
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,880
Marlene.

586
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,559
With a car like that,
the rest of us

587
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,689
never stood a chance, did we?

588
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,689
Maybe the car being so good
has something to do with me.

589
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,459
Come on, Niki.
You're in a Ferrari.

590
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,729
I'm in a Hesketh.

591
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,569
Equal terms, the way
it was in Formula 3,

592
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,929
- Id' beat you and you know it.
- Never.

593
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,099
You might win one
race, maybe two,

594
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,539
because you're aggressive.

595
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,469
But in the long run, over
the course of a season,

596
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,609
no chance.

597
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:14,879
Right. Why is that?

598
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,539
Because to be a champion,

599
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,849
it takes more than
just being quick.

600
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,479
It's the whole picture.

601
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,749
You're just a charger
and a party guy.

602
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,449
That's why everybody likes you.

603
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,390
Try saying that and tell
me you're not jealous.

604
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,459
Why would I be jealous?
Think about it.

605
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,759
All that affection,
all those smiles,

606
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,729
is a sign of disrespect.

607
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,459
They don't fear you. Whereas
compared that to me.

608
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,869
Yes, compared to you,
whom no one likes.

609
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,699
- Right.
- Not even his own teammates.

610
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,539
Right. Because I'm
a serious guy.

611
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,209
I go to bed early, I look
after myself, after my car.

612
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,209
- Yes, you're very well-behaved.
- Go to work, kick ass.

613
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,839
And then, after the
race, I go home

614
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,449
instead of going to bars

615
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:55,219
and talk all this bullshit
with all these assholes.

616
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,610
Arseholes?

617
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,480
You should go home
more often too.

618
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,690
I heard you got married.

619
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,480
Yes, I did.

620
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,930
So where is she, this
mysterious wife?

621
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,430
In New York, working.

622
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,539
You know, I've never
seen you with her once.

623
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,730
No?

624
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,709
Well, maybe that's because
you're always at home,

625
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,879
on your own, looking
after yourself,

626
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,870
being a good little boy.

627
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,020
Take a drink on me, James.

628
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:38,890
Thank you, Niki. I
might just have two.

629
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,169
Right, Bubbles,

630
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,839
whatever it takes to beat
that prick next year,

631
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,109
just say it,

632
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,879
you're word is my command.

633
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,179
There are no lengths to
which I will not go.

634
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,810
And I mean it.

635
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,780
What the hell's going on?

636
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,519
Where is everybody?

637
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,050
What's the matter?

638
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,129
Do you know what the
date it is today?

639
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,999
Yes. It's November, the 14th.
Why?

640
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,870
Do you have any idea of the
significance of that date?

641
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,070
I don't know. Time to
start killing pheasants?

642
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,249
Actually, it's the deadline
for securing sponsorship

643
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,949
for the forthcoming
Formula 1 season.

644
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:37,949
Yes?

645
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,019
Which elapsed at
midnight last night

646
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,489
- and we didn't attract any.
- Well, so?

647
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,789
We aren't looking
for sponsorship.

648
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:48,630
Like you said, condoms an
cigarettes, vulgar, right?

649
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,930
Right.

650
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:54,130
Except we are, or were.

651
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,130
I've made something
of a miscalculation.

652
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,670
The economics, Formula
1, realities thereof.

653
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,710
It turns out not like the
lower divisions at all.

654
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,550
What are you saying?

655
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,150
I'm saying it's over, Superstar.

656
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,790
The banks have stepped in,
started laying everyone off.

657
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,560
Probably have to
sell this place.

658
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,800
On, Christ.

659
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,770
I need a drive, Pete. I need
you to find me a drive.

660
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,140
I mean, what about Lotus?

661
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,449
You don't wanna know.

662
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,610
- Actually, I do.
- Okay.

663
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,789
They felt your
reputation preceded you.

664
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,730
And what does that mean?

665
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,190
It's my other line. Look,
I'll get back to you.

666
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:34,639
Peter Hunt.

667
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,600
Fuck!

668
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,710
Don't worry. Something
will turn up.

669
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,690
Doubt that will help
in the meantime.

670
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,669
Why don't we go away
at the weekend?

671
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:05,790
Skiing.

672
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,630
Before I go back to New York.

673
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,609
Talk to me, James. Don't
make a stranger of me.

674
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:18,170
You know, Suzy, only a stranger
would invite me skiing

675
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:22,510
when they know I haven't
got a fucking drivel

676
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,780
I can't watch this.

677
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:33,159
What were you hoping for anyway?

678
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,759
A well-adjusted knight
in shining armour?

679
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,490
No danger of that.

680
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,999
- Let me give you some advice.
- I'm all ears.

681
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,969
Don't go to men who are
willing to kill themselves

682
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:44,269
driving in circles
looking for normality.

683
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,939
I never expected normality.

684
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,979
God knows I walked into
this with my eyes open.

685
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,679
I just hoped I'd married someone
who is half as impressive

686
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,709
on the inside as he
is on the outside!

687
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,749
At least there's something
behind the facade.

688
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,819
- James.
- Fuck off to New York, dear.

689
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,119
There must be a moisturiser
or an eye shadow somewhere

690
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,060
that needs your vapid
mush to flog it.

691
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,229
- Hello?
- Hi, James.

692
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:43,420
It's Peter. Something's
up at McLaren.

693
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,469
- What have you heard?
- Nothing. Why?

694
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,469
I heard Emerson's off.
He's dumped them in it.

695
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,609
Jesus. Get me in there, Pete.

696
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,900
Say anything, just
get me in that room.

697
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,949
I'll come straight to the point.

698
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:03,979
- Our esteemed lead driver...
- Fitti-fucking-paldi.

699
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,619
Has ditched us for another
team at the last minute.

700
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,889
- Coper-fucking-sucar.
- And we need a replacement.

701
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:10,950
Asa-fucking-P.

702
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,459
Fortunately a few hands
have already gone up,

703
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,799
good people.

704
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,730
- Jacky Ickx.
- I'm quicker than Jacky.

705
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:21,869
But he's consistent, dependable.

706
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:23,139
A grown-up.

707
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:26,609
Right, and will he go for that
gap when no one else will?

708
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:29,439
Will he put his life on the
line the day it really matters?

709
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,009
The sponsors like him.

710
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:33,109
What do you want, a driver
or a brush salesman?

711
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:35,179
- We wanna be successful.
- Yes, so do I.

712
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,719
But that means
beating Niki Lauda,

713
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,519
not being a show
pony for sponsors.

714
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,189
I heard about this
thing with Niki.

715
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:41,650
Everyone has.

716
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,719
You really thing
you can beat him?

717
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,029
I'd beat him in a McLaren.

718
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:47,960
It's the only car out there
as quick as the Ferrari.

719
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:50,759
Which is why I'm here, begging.

720
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,199
I'll do whatever you ask.

721
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,469
I'll put on a tie, I'll
smile for sponsors,

722
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:56,469
say the right things.

723
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,900
I can beat this guy, trust me.

724
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:01,909
Just give me the drive.

725
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:04,139
Yeah, he can be a loose canon.

726
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,549
And, yeah, he will
drive you all mad,

727
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:09,679
but in terms of raw
talent and right stuff,

728
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,949
there is no better
driver in the world.

729
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,189
He's the real thing, Teddy.

730
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,789
He's what we all
came into this for.

731
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:19,089
Nine days out of ten you'll
be pulling your hair out,

732
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:22,159
but on that tenth day
James will be unbeatable.

733
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,759
That is the day you will wish
you had him in your car.

734
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,599
<i>You'll never win the
championship with Jacky Ickx.</i>

735
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,400
You just might with James.

1976 Formula 1 season,</i>

740
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:01,599

Hunt qualified fastest,</i>

741
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,069
<i>beating Niki Lauda's
Ferrari to pole position</i>

742

743
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,470
New car.

744
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,040
- I noticed.
- Pole position.

745
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,149
I noticed that too.

746
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:16,919
Level playing field now,
my rally little friend.

747
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,919
Yeah.

748
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,149
Let's see where we
are after lap one.

749
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,920
Let's see where we are
in five races time.

750
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,129
<i>Hunt has the pit
Lane pole position,</i>

751
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,759
<i>which should give
him the best chance</i>

752
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,929
<i>of outdragging Lauda's Ferrari.</i>

753
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,769
<i>If ever there was a doubt about</i>

754
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:34,829
<i>whether Lauda had a serious
challenger to this season,</i>

755
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:38,130
<i>Hunt and his McLaren have
certainly given us the answer.</i>

GRAND PRIX SOUTH AFRICA 76

759

<i>Here in South Africa,
James Hunt is determined</i>

760
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:00,620
<i>to make amends after that
disastrous retirement in Brazil.</i>

761
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:05,399
<i>But it's Lauda who takes
the flag here at Kyalami.</i>

762
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,429
<i>James Hunt comes home second</i>

763

That wind you can feel is me
breathing down your neck.

Next time I'll have you.

767
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,380
We'll see in Spain.

768
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:41,860
SPAIN-HUNT WINS LAUDA 2ND

769
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:46,069
James Hunt finally takes his
first victory of the season

770
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:48,909
here in Spain, after
a brilliant drive.

771
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:51,470
It was only a matter of time.

772
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:10,699
- It's too wide.
- Disqualified.

773
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,169
- What?
- You're disqualified.

774
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:15,069
How can we be disqualified?

775
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,400
- 1.5 cm.
- It's the same car.

776
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:28,010
...McLaren M23 has proved
very controversial here.

777
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,549
Just make it narrower.
I don't care how.

778
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:33,589
New rear suspension.
New wishbones.

779
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,459
I wanna make sure this
thing is legal, no doubts.

780
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,189
Then we'd better move the oil
coolers to the old position.

781
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:41,729
- The wing brackets need...
- Fuck.

782

<i>And James Hunt is out!</i>

790
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,049
Can you tell us what happened?

791
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,959
Sure. It's magic, we've
taken a great car,

792
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,859
a great piece of engineering
and overnight turned it

793
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:18,460
into a big, huge stinking turd.

794
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,430
BELGIUM MAY 1976

795
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,610
Shit!

796
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,549
What the hell have you done?
The car's evil!

797
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,249
It's fucking undriveable!

798
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,819
If there's a problem with
the car, we'll fix it.

799
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,889
The car is a piece of shit.
You should be appealing this.

800
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,729
- We are appealing.
- We'll son it out.

801
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:48,189
- They're killing us out there.
- Go an get your dick wet.

802
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:50,159
- You're a wanker!
- Fuck you!

803
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,129
You're fucking wanker!

804
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:54,229
But this was a good
race for you, no, Niki?

805
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:55,639
It's good for everyone

806
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,539
that the quickest car
happens to be a legal car.

807
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,439
James, your 50 points behind
Lauda in the championship.

808
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,209
You've had another
retirement today.

809
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:03,739
What's going wrong?

810
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,749
It's dirty politics
and dirty tricks,

811
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,649
that's what's going wrong.

812
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:09,879
<i>So as we approach
the halfway point</i>

813
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,919
<i>in this year's Formula 1 season,</i>

814
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,189
<i>Ferrari and Niki Lauda
seem clearly on top</i>

815
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,529
<i>and James Hunt and
McLaren are struggling.</i>

816
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,860
So, five races in,
how's it going so far?

817
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,799
It's fine. Just got a little
problem with an Austrian rat

818
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,869
and his team of Italian cheats
who've destroyed my car.

819
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:32,009
- What are you talking about?
- About the race in Spain I won.

820
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,869
Yeah, in a car which
is not legal.

821
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:35,609
Five eighths of
an inch too wide.

822
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,909
You know that doesn't have the
slightest effect on speed.

823
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:39,609
But you complained and
your team of lawyers

824
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:42,579
leaned on the authorities. Now
we've had to rebuild the car

825
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,189
- and it's become a monster.
- At least it's a legal monster.

826
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:46,989
You've had to
resort to cheating.

827
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:50,259
You're driving an illegal car and
call me a cheater? Pathetic.

828
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,929
- Rules are rules.
- Yes, and rats are rats.

829
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:55,860
Thank you. Thank you.

830
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:00,729
Do you really think
it upsets me, James,

831
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:03,699
calling me a rat because
I look like one?

832
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,070
I don't mind it.

833
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:07,609
Rats are ugly, sure,
and nobody like them,

834
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:09,079
but they're very intelligent

835
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,439
and they have a strong
survival instinct.

836
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,410
Wonderful.

837
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,940
No wonder she left him.

838
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:35,870
Anyone seen Suzy?

839
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,739
She's supposed to be here today.

840
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,230
We didn't wanna tell
you before the race.

841
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:44,840
Tell me what?

Yeah.

So when did all this start?

851
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,420
That weekend I went skiing.

852
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,630
Why have you come here, James?

853
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,130
I've got to get you back.

854
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:42,999
You don't want me back.

855
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,839
You never wanted to be
married in the first place.

856
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,509
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, come on, James.

857
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:50,139
You did it because you
hoped it might change you,

858
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,249
settle you down, help
with the racing.

859
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,779
No, I didn't.

860
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,179
And who knows, if it had
been just the drinking,

861
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:59,170
or the dope, or the
infidelity or the moods,

862
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,719
it might even have worked.

863
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,719
- But when it's all of them...
- Yes, I know, I'm terrible.

864
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,710
No, you're not terrible.

865
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:09,950
You're just who you are at
this point in your life.

866
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,200
God help anyone who wants more.

867
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,869
And Richard Burton,

868
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:20,430
will he be able
to give you more?

869
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:24,439
You know, he has quite the
bad boy reputation himself.

870
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,179
What's important is
how it feels to me,

871
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,170
and it feels like he adores me.

872
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,090
James!

873
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:40,229
Are you and Suzy
getting back together?

874
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,499
It's all very amicable.

875
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,959
My wife has found
herself a new backer...

876
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,729
I mean, lover, which
makes her happy.

877
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,499
And Mr. Burton has found a
way of feeling young again,

878
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,699
which makes him happy.

879
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,669
Let's hope his pockets are deep.
They'll need to be.

880
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,139
And I found a way to be
single and have an ex-wife

881
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,149
without it costing me a Penny,

882
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,910
which has to go down as the
biggest win of my career.

883
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:04,470
I have a flight to catch.

884

BRANDS HATCH SUNDAY
18TH JULY 1976

894
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,499
<i>Hunt has really closed
the gap on Lauda</i>

895
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,470
<i>as they head into Druids.</i>

896
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,709
<i>Niki Lauda is under real
pressure from James Hunt</i>

897
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:09,370
<i>as they go up the hill

898
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,380
<i>And Hunt is in front of Lauda!</i>

899
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:26,889
<i>So James Hunt gets the
plaudits of the crowd,</i>

900
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:29,459
<i>the first Briton to win
a British Grand Prix</i>

901
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,920
<i>at Brands Hatch since
Jim Clark in 1964.</i>

902
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,439
James, at the moment you've got
a terrific edge over the rest,

903
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,709
<i>how have you achieved
this advantage?</i>

904
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:41,870
Big balls.

905
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:46,749
<i>Following an inquiry into
the disqualification</i>

906
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:49,719
<i>of driver James Hunt from
the Spanish Grand Prix,</i>

907
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:52,989
<i>it has been decided to
overturn this disqualification</i>

908
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:56,550
<i>and to restore his victory
and reinstate his points.</i>

909
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:03,659
James!

910
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,629
A few weeks ago you were out
of the running completely

911
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:09,499
and now you're right back in it.
What's changed?

912
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,439
It's a combination of factors,

913
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,939
not all of which I'm
prepared to discuss here.

914
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,039
But justice being done re the
disqualification in Spain

915
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,100
helps and having my car
back at its best again.

916
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,710
Are you worried?

917
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:11,019
<i>Welcome to the
legendary Nüburgring.</i>

918
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:13,719
<i>This is a 14.2 mile track,</i>

919
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,160
<i>complete with 185
corners and bends.</i>

920
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,819
<i>Welcome to the Nüburgring,</i>

921
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:20,689
<i>the most dangerous circuit
on the season calendar.</i>

922
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:22,249
<i>In Formula 1 it is known</i>

923
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,789
<i>as "The Graveyard."</i>

924
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:25,659
<i>The weather conditions
are far from ideal</i>

925
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:29,120
<i>and latest reports indicate
there is no relief in sight.</i>

926
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:34,520
Gentlemen.

927
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:38,539
Well, gentlemen,
please be quiet.

928
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:39,839
Thank you.

929
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,700
- Niki Lauda.
- Thank you.

930
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:46,649
I called this meeting because,
as all you drivers know,

931
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:49,179
the Nüburgring is the most
stupid, barbaric, outdated

932
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:50,979
and dangerous track
in the world.

933
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:53,149
You've all seen the rain
that has been falling today.

934
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:55,189
Those of you with
experience know the ring

935
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:58,059
needs perfect conditions to
be even remotely acceptable

936
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:59,659
in terms of risk.

937
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:01,959
And today, with the rain,
it's anything but perfect,

938
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,999
so I called this meeting to
take vote to cancel the race.

939
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,690
Cancel the race?

940
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:09,739
There would be no
change to the situation

941
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:11,069
as far as points is concerned.

942
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:12,669
The race would
simply be cancelled.

943
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:13,739
This is bullshit!

944
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,879
If the race is cancelled,
none of us get our race fees.

945
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,209
That's true, you leave
without your fee,

946
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:20,479
but you might leave
with your life.

947
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,619
It also means that you
would effectively win

948
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,450
the championship.

949
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:27,649
So I can see why this
suits you just fine.

950
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:28,719
Why?

951
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,619
There won't be no
points for me either.

952
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:34,159
No, but there'd be one race less
where I, or anyone else here,

953
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,459
- could catch you.
- James is right.

954
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,529
This is just tactics!

955
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:41,130
Maybe he's just frightened.

956
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,000
Which asshole said this?

957
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:51,479
Yes, of course, I'm frightened,

958
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,910
and so are you.

959
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,549
I accept every time
I get in my car

960
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:59,789
there's 20% chance I could
die, and I can live with it,

961
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:01,889
but not one percent more.

962
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:04,659
And today, with the
rain, the risk is more.

963
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:07,759
I suppose that all depends on
how good you are in the rain.

964
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,699
I have the track record here.

965
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:12,629
I'm the only person in history
to do the ring in under 7 Min.,

966
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:16,160
so, actually, it's to my
advantage to race here today.

967
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:19,100
Because I'm quicker
than all of you.

968
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,839
- Come on.
- Fine. Then let's race.

969
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,830
Yeah!

970
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:27,909
- Niki, let's race.
- Gentlemen, please.

971
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:30,180
Why are we here, Niki? Come on.

972
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:38,150
Well, all those in favor
of cancelling the race.

973
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:50,760
All those in favor of racing.

974
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:58,800
Gentlemen, the race is on.

975
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:07,850
- Ridiculous.
- What a waste of time.

976
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:10,219
You know, Niki,
every now and then

977
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,710
it helps if people like you.

978
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:30,179
<i>In places the track is
still dangerously wet,</i>

979
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,840
<i>but following a drivers meeting,
a decision has been taken.</i>

980
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,990
<i>One minute to go.</i>

981
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,700
Jochen's going on slicks.
You wanna change?

982
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:58,499
- Is Niki gonna change?
- No.

983
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,840
Then we stay on wets too.

984
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:10,940
- Niki, okay?
- I'm good.

985
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:14,380
All right, fire her up.

986
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:31,769
<i>This season's fight for
the F1 World Championship</i>

987
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:34,809
<i>has so far been the
story of two men.</i>

988
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:38,639
<i>Thus far it's been going pretty
much the way of Niki Lauda.</i>

989
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,209
<i>But James Hunt has
qualified fastest here.</i>

990
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:43,849
<i>He is on pole position for
the German Grand Prix</i>

991
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:47,110
<i>with Niki Lauda alongside

992
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:50,689
<i>It's a long race.</i>

993
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:52,689
<i>If the track starts to dry out,</i>

994
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:56,220
<i>the wet-weather tyres will
no longer be as quick.</i>

995
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:18,619
<i>Niki Lauda and James Hunt,</i>

996
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,719
<i>side by side on the
front of the grid,</i>

01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,120
<i>go away absolutely as one!</i>

998
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:39,239
<i>Lauda very aggressive
on Hunt there,</i>

999
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,870
<i>forcing the McLaren
onto the grass.</i>

1000
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,249
<i>Lauda has the lead right now!
He leads into the first corner!</i>

1001
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:51,440
<i>Hunt is in second place!</i>

1002
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,589
<i>Mass storming past Hunt!</i>

1003
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:02,050
<i>He made the right choice to go
with the dry-weather tyres.</i>

1004

<i>Mass passing Lauda now!</i>

1005
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:08,969
<i>Jochen Mass, in the number
12 McLaren, takes the lead!</i>

1006

<i>after just one lap of this race.</i>

1009
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:17,470
Come on, let's go!

1010
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:29,589
See? I told you to go on slicks.
You should've taken my advice.

1011
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:31,819
Fuck off. Where's Niki?

1012
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:34,950
Behind you. He made
the same mistake.

1013
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:47,790
Come on!

1014
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,870
Come on! What's going on?

1015
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:57,979
<i>The tyre-changing frenzy caused

<i>- with Mass in the lead now.
- You're clear. Go!</i>

1017
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:05,850
Lauda urging his
mechanics to hurry.

1018
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:11,460
It's a disaster! Come on!

1019
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:24,070
What's going on, you assholes?

1020
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:50,199
<i>This race has gone
wrong for him so far.</i>

1021
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,139
<i>His championship
rival, James Hunt,</i>

1022
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,160

Get me out!

1027
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,410
Help me!

1028
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:10,019
<i>Several cars are involved.</i>

<i>Looks like it might be

1030
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,890
- Come this way!
- Come on, come on!

1031
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:35,570
Keep trying

1032
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:44,880

01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,149
<i>was the worst since
records began.</i>

1035
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:30,919
<i>In Formula 1 today, victory
celebrations were muted</i>

1036
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,129
<i>after a horrific accident
involving world champion.</i>

1037
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:34,829
<i>Niki Lauda.</i>

1038
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:36,859
<i>Due to safety concerns
before the race,</i>

1039
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:39,159
<i>the Austrian had said
he would not take pan,</i>

1040
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,130
<i>but in the end he did.</i>

1041
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:44,539
<i>He was making up for lost time
when he went off the track,</i>

1042
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:46,869
<i>puncturing the
Ferrari's fuel tank.</i>

1043
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:49,839
<i>Brett Lunger was unable to
avoid the flaming wreck</i>

1044
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,779
<i>but was unhurt and joined other
drivers to rescue Lauda,</i>

1045
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:55,809
<i>who was taken to Manheim
Hospital with severe burns,</i>

1046
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:59,449
<i>the incident reminding us again
of the dangers of Formula 1.</i>

1047
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:01,549
<i>Niki Lauda was trapped
for almost a minute</i>

1048
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:04,610
<i>in a searing inferno
of 800-plus degrees.</i>

1049
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:53,660
<i>James Hunt gains on the
absent Niki Lauda.</i>

1050
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:59,770
28th DAY IN HOSPITAL
29th August 1976.

1051
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,239
- Morning, chaps.
- Hey, here's the man.

1052
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,580
Looking good.

1053
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,719
- What's going on?
- Jesus. It's Niki.

1054
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,919
- What about him?
- He's here.

1055
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,840
- What?
- He's racing.

1056
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,010
Niki.

1057
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,710
It's that bad, huh?

1058
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:31,750
No.

1059
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:36,619
In hospital, I asked them
straight, no bullshit,

1060
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:39,459
how bad my appearance would be.

1061
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:42,459
They said with time
it would be fine.

1062
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:43,790
But it won't.

1063
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:47,920
I can tell, seeing
your reaction.

1064
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:50,699
I'll spend the rest of my life

1065
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:53,540
with a face that
frightens people.

1066
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:59,239
You know, Niki, I tried to write
you a letter at the time,

1067
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,730
to apologise.

1068
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:04,149
The drivers' meeting in
Germany, before the race.

1069
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:07,019
- I swayed the room.
- Yes, you did.

1070
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:09,789
That race should never
have gone ahead.

1071
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:11,580
No, it shouldn't.

1072
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:15,589
So in many ways I feel
responsible for what happened...

1073
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:16,860
You were.

1074
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:19,890
But, trust me,

1075
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,739
watching you win those races,

1076
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:26,230
while I was fighting
for my life...

1077
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:31,470
you were equally responsible for
getting me back in the car.

1078
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:01,460
- How are you feeling, Niki?
- Fine.

1079
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:02,969
Niki,

1080
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:06,539
can you confirm to us exactly
which procedures you had

1081
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:08,549
and the expectations
for you recovery?

1082
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:09,540
Sure.

1083
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:11,849
I had a skin graft operation

1084
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:14,750
where they put half my
right thigh in my face.

1085
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,350
Now, it doesn't look too good,

1086
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:20,929
but one unexpected advantage is

1087
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:23,089
it's impossible to perspire
through a skin graft,

1088
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:25,499
so sweat will never run
into my eyes again,

1089
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,860
which is good for a driver.

1090
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:30,969
When they heard about
your condition,

1091
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:33,609
Ferrari immediately hired
a replacement driver,

1092
01:21:33,610 --> 01:21:34,909
Carlos Reutemann.

1093
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:38,470
Yeah, before ever
reaching the hospital.

1094
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:42,210
- Is Reutemann driving today too?
- Yes.

1095
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,749
And keen to make an impression.

1096
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:46,749
So let's see where
Mr. Reutemann finishes

1097
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:49,080
and where I finish today.

1098
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,719
James Hunt and McLaren
have caught up a lot

1099
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,689
while you were away.

1100
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:54,660
Yes.

1101
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:55,390
So is there a question now.

1102
01:21:55,391 --> 01:21:57,029
So is there a question now

1103
01:21:57,030 --> 01:21:59,960
or are you just trying
to piss me off?

1104
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,999
You still think you can win?

1105
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,699
Yes, of course.

1106
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,190
I have the better car.

1107
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:10,539
And possibly I'm
the better driver.

1108
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:13,109
But he's a clever guy and
he's used his time well

1109
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:14,609
while I was lying
half-dead in hospital

1110
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:15,779
while I was lying
half-dead in hospital

1111
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,610
to win some points.

1112
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:22,410
And what did your wife say
when she saw your face?

1113
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:29,520
She said, "Sweetie",

1114
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:32,920
you don't need a face to drive.
You just need the right foot."

1115
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,900
I'm being serious.

1116
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,239
Do you really think your
marriage can survive

1117
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,730
with the way you look now?

1118
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:45,630
And I'm being serious too.

1119
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,510
Fuck you.

1120
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:50,080
Press conference over.

1121
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:58,119
- That was hairy.
- You know how to get noticed.

1122
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:59,919
I thought it went
well, to be honest.

1123
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,889
They don't like it when
it's not going their way.

1124
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:03,529
That's the game.

1125
01:23:03,530 --> 01:23:05,659
- See you.
- See you later.

1126
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:07,869
- James, are you all right?
- Good, yeah.

1127
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:10,569
I think I've got something for
you on that last question,

1128
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:11,869
- about Niki.
- You heard about that?

1129
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:13,310
- About Niki.
- You heard about that?

1130
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:15,740
James?

1131
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:25,910
Please, James...

1132
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:29,850
Now go home to your wife
and ask her how you look.

1133
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:33,220
Prick.

1134
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,579
<i>So Niki Lauda, just 42 days</i>

1135
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:55,179
<i>after his near-fatal
accident at Nüburgring,</i>

1136
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:56,849
<i>will race here today, at Monza</i>

1137
01:23:56,850 --> 01:24:00,680
<i>against all medical advice and
no doubt in incredible pain.</i>

1138
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:08,730
<i>Photographers, please,
clear the grid.</i>

1139
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:48,350
Niki, it's time.

1140
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:51,020
Okay?

1141
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,810
<i>Please, clear the grid.</i>

1142
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:03,950
<i>One minute to go.</i>

1143
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:53,099
<i>The returning Niki Lauda
seems overwhelmed.</i>

1144
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,960
<i>He's been overtaken
by car after car.</i>

1145
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:08,410
<i>Lauda's off line. He runs
wide onto the grass.</i>

1146
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:15,489
<i>He wrestles it back
onto the track,</i>

1147
01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:17,780
<i>but that was a bad
moment for Niki.</i>

1148
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:24,199
<i>Niki Lauda's the
reigning world champion,</i>

1149
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,429
<i>but maybe in his current state
he's a danger out there,</i>

1150
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:30,490
<i>to himself and to the
rest of the field.</i>

1151
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:36,069
<i>And Stuck has collided with
Mario Andretti's Lotus!</i>

1152
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:39,040
<i>Niki's boxed in! He's
got nowhere to go!</i>

1153
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:55,989
<i>Niki Lauda's actually
making a move.</i>

1154
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:58,120
<i>He's on Brambilla's tail.</i>

1155
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:03,769
<i>He pulls out of the
slipstream to overtake.</i>

1156
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:05,969
<i>Lauda's starting
to find the form</i>

1157
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,800
<i>that early in this race
we believed he'd lost.</i>

1158
01:27:14,850 --> 01:27:17,549
<i>Lauda's now lapping
faster than Reutemann</i>

1159
01:27:17,550 --> 01:27:20,260
<i>and closing the gap ahead.</i>

1160
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:25,189
<i>Lauda closing on
Carlos Reutemann,</i>

1161
01:27:25,190 --> 01:27:27,559
<i>the man called in to
be his replacement</i>

1162
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,120
<i>in the Ferrari team.</i>

1163
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,839
<i>And there's James
Hunt's McLaren,</i>

1164
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,140
<i>smoking stationary by
the side of the road.</i>

1165
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:48,840
<i>This is bad news for
Hunt's championship hopes.</i>

1166
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:54,989
<i>It's Ronnie Peterson</i>

1167
01:27:54,990 --> 01:27:57,369
<i>who comes home the
winner here at Monza.</i>

1168
01:27:57,370 --> 01:28:00,550
<i>But all eyes are on the man who
finishes a brilliant fourth!</i>

1169
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:02,530
<i>Niki Lauda!</i>

1170
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,539
<i>What a race, what a
man, what a season.</i>

1171
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:48,709
<i>With a 4th-place finish and
three priceless points,</i>

1172
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:50,809
<i>Niki Lauda is a
major step closer</i>

1173
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:53,610
<i>to retaining the
World Championship.</i>

1174
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:55,009
<i>So the long, grueling and
incredibly dramatic season</i>

1175
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:57,939
<i>comes down to this
final race in Japan,</i>

1176
01:29:57,940 --> 01:30:00,470
<i>in the shadow of Mount Fuji.</i>

1177
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:03,909
<i>Niki Lauda goes into this
deciding race at Fuji</i>

1178
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:06,219
<i>just three points
ahead of James Hunt,</i>

1179
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:09,219
<i>Hunt knowing he must beat the
Austrian fair and square</i>

1180
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:11,270
<i>to take the title.</i>

1181
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:15,559
James, do you think you can
cope with the pressure?

1182
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:17,929
Well, I've never really
understood what that means.

1183
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:21,060
I love my job. I love competing.
I love racing.

1184
01:30:22,030 --> 01:30:24,269
Maybe you should ask Niki.
He's the World Champion.

1185
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:25,899
He's got everything to lose.

1186
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:28,209
Mr. Lauda, are you
feeling pressure?

1187
01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:30,510
Do I look like I'm
feeling pressure?

1188
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:33,979
I'm World Champion

1189
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:37,049
and on the verge to become
World Champion again.

1190
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:39,479
Hunt now has the
opportunity to win,

1191
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,249
but it's not so easy
to become a champion.

1192
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:43,980
You have to really believe
it to make it possible.

1193
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:46,719
James, is there anything
you'd like to add?

1194
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,119
If Niki is being tricky
and getting a kicky

1195
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,510
out of playing mind games,

1196
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,229
then fine, I'm flattered.

1197
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:56,630
The fact is momentum is with me.
I've never felt better.

1198
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,469
I fully expect the next press
conference we will have

1199
01:30:59,470 --> 01:31:01,100
will be with me as
World Champion.

1200
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:08,209
<i>Intermittent heavy

1204
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:19,219
<i>And so with today's Japanese
Grand Prix to come,</i>

1205
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:21,689
<i>Lauda's lead a
mere three points.</i>

1206
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:23,559
<i>What a way to finish the season.</i>

1207
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:24,959
<i>Hunt or Lauda?</i>

1208
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,539
<i>The final chapter will unfold when
we bring you extended coverage...</i>

1209
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:29,899
They've got to cancel the race.

1210
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,269
It's lethal out there.

1211
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:33,169
The race is going ahead.

1212
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:35,669
Television rights have been
sold all around the world.

1213
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:37,039
The showdown between
you and Niki

1214
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,639
is all anyone wants to see.

1215
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:41,749
<i>With heavy rain continuing
to fall here at Fuji,</i>

1216
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:44,009
<i>a decision has
finally been made.</i>

1217
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:47,860
<i>The 1976 Japanese Grand
Prix will go ahead.</i>

1218

<i>All drivers to
your cars, please.</i>

1219
01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:17,550
<i>Five minutes to go.</i>

1220
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,659
- All right?
- All right.

1221
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:04,059
- Hold still.
- What the hell are you doing?

1222
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:05,729
To let the condensation out.

1223
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:08,599
- It'll also let the water in.
- Not if you're leading.

1224
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:11,830
Trust me, this race is
all about the start.

1225
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:15,100
- Need a hand here?
- Yeah, hold it, Teddy.

1226
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:31,950
Okay, start the bastard.

1227
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:35,720
Good luck, kid.

1228
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,620
Good luck, James!

1229
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:19,900
30 seconds to go.

1230
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:42,029
<i>Electric tension here at Fuji.</i>

1231
01:34:42,030 --> 01:34:44,499
<i>80,000 bedraggled race fans</i>

1232
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:47,629
<i>and the racing grudge

1233
01:34:47,630 --> 01:34:49,869
<i>And there's Mario Andretti
in pole position,</i>

1234
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:51,930
<i>James Hunt alongside him.</i>

1235
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:55,239
<i>On row two of the grid,</i>

1236
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:56,809
<i>there is Niki Lauda,</i>

1237

<i>and on row three of the grid, Joe
Schecketer from South Africa</i>

1238
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:01,109

1239
01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:04,140
<i>Behind him, the rest
of the 25-car field.</i>

1240
01:35:21,130 --> 01:35:23,829
<i>There's the flag and finally
the Japanese Grand Prix</i>

1241
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:25,500
<i>is underway!</i>

1242
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:40,449
<i>In this conditions it
must be almost impossible</i>

1243
01:35:40,450 --> 01:35:43,150
<i>to drive a 450-horsepower car!</i>

1244
01:36:10,050 --> 01:36:12,219
<i>And it's Andretti
who has the lead,</i>

1245
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:13,649
<i>but Hunt is attacking.</i>

1246
01:36:13,650 --> 01:36:15,889
<i>Hunt's going round the
outside of Andretti!</i>

1247
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:17,749
<i>Niki Lauda following
him through!</i>

1248
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:20,720
<i>Hunt leads into the
first right-hander!</i>

1249
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:06,569
<i>Hunt comes through to complete
his first lap leading the field.</i>

1250
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:08,739
<i>At least he has clear
vision in front of him.</i>

1251
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:11,670
<i>Niki Lauda behind him,
eating his spray.</i>

1252
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:32,199
<i>Lauda is slowing!</i>

1253
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:36,060
<i>Niki Lauda is bringing the Ferrari no.
1 into the pit!</i>

1254
01:37:36,730 --> 01:37:39,539
<i>Some sort of problem,
we can't imagine what,</i>

1255
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:41,500
<i>so early in the race.</i>

1256
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:47,640
What's wrong with the car?

1257
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:50,150
What's wrong with the car?

1258
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:52,919
Niki! What's wrong with the car?

1259
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:55,150
Nothing. Car's perfect.

1260
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:01,019
What are you doing?

1261
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:02,129
I'm stopping

1262
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:04,189
<i>His mechanics are asking
what the problem is.</i>

1263
01:38:04,190 --> 01:38:06,759
<i>But wait! Niki Lauda's
getting out of the car!</i>

1264
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,529
<i>This is sensational!</i>

1265
01:38:08,530 --> 01:38:10,699
<i>The reigning World
Champion, Niki Lauda,</i>

1266
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:12,469
<i>is out of this race.</i>

1267
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:13,940
It's too dangerous.

1268
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:15,839
Niki, you want me to say

1269
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,409
there was a problem with
the car, for the media?

1270
01:38:18,410 --> 01:38:19,380
No.

1271
01:38:20,510 --> 01:38:21,940
Tell them the truth.

1272
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:24,509
<i>Now, what is happening?</i>

1273
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:26,479
<i>They're talking to
the team manager.</i>

1274
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,920
<i>Lauda explaining something.</i>

1275
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:46,769
<i>With Lauda out, James Hunt
knows he has to finish</i>

1276
01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:50,809
<i>this race in third place or
higher to be World Champion.</i>

1277
01:38:50,810 --> 01:38:53,779
<i>But the job's not done
yet for James Hunt.</i>

1278
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:55,579
<i>In these dreadful conditions,</i>

1279
01:38:55,580 --> 01:38:58,100
<i>he still has to go the distance.</i>

1280
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:01,649
<i>Fifteen laps to go here at Fuji.</i>

1281
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:03,689
<i>James Hunt or Niki Lauda?</i>

1282
01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:06,759
<i>This extraordinary
season is not over yet.</i>

1283
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:10,090
<i>In this treacherous final
round, can James Hunt hang on?</i>

1284
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:14,059
<i>And the scoreboard tells a story.
Lap 58.</i>

1285
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:15,860
<i>Hunt in the lead.</i>

1286
01:39:17,170 --> 01:39:19,760
Oh, God, his tyres,
they're blistering.

1287
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:24,609
<i>Brambilla very close behind him,
closing on him all the time.</i>

1288
01:39:24,610 --> 01:39:27,939
<i>And he's trying to drive
inside James Hunt.</i>

1289
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:30,909
<i>Hunt cuts across the
orange March nose.</i>

1290
01:39:30,910 --> 01:39:32,949
<i>Hunt not having that at all.
And he's spinning.</i>

1291
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:36,719
<i>He missed Hunt but almost took
James Hunt out of the race</i>

1292
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:38,759
<i>and out of the world
championship.</i>

1293
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:42,120
<i>Now we find Mario Andretti
closing on James Hunt.</i>

1294
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,729
<i>Mario Andretti's
going past Hunt!</i>

1295
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:51,860
<i>Hunt is slowing. James Hunt
seems to have a problem.</i>

1296
01:39:57,110 --> 01:39:58,879
<i>Despite this wet conditions,</i>

1297
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,369
<i>these wet-weather tyres
wear extremely fast.</i>

1298
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:03,529
Hunt's tyres, they're gone.

1299
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:06,910
<i>Hunt nursing his car
back to the pit stop.</i>

1300
01:40:08,890 --> 01:40:11,859
<i>That back marker's
going past Hunt.</i>

1301
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:14,220
LAP 70 4 LAPS TO GO

1302
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:26,499
<i>Look at that left front tyre,
right front tyre, sorry.</i>

1303
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:29,769
<i>No tread on it at all. And
the other one is flat.</i>

1304
01:40:29,770 --> 01:40:31,240
Let's go! Let's go!

1305
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:38,849
Okay? When did you
break your gear lever?

1306
01:40:38,850 --> 01:40:40,649
Nine or ten laps ago.

1307
01:40:40,650 --> 01:40:43,019
- Alistair, we need to lift it!
- Come on!

1308
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:44,759
- At the front!
- Let's go!

1309
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:47,859
<i>Regazzoni's Ferrari and
Jacques Lafitte in the Ligier</i>

1310
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:49,589
<i>have gone ahead.</i>

1311
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:50,990
Come on, hurry!

1312
01:40:51,530 --> 01:40:54,660
You did it. You're going
to be World Champion!

1313
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:56,189
Not yet.

1314
01:40:56,190 --> 01:40:59,769
<i>A few laps ago, James Hunt was
looking like champion elect.</i>

1315
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:02,670
<i>Now it looks as though it's
all gone wrong for him.</i>

1316
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:05,509
- James.
- Come on!

1317
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:06,639
- Listen.
- What?

1318
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:09,009
Just go easy out there.

1319
01:41:09,010 --> 01:41:12,919
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying look after yourself.

1320
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:15,149
We want you back in one piece.

1321
01:41:15,150 --> 01:41:18,519
You're too far back. There's too
many drivers in front of you.

1322
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:21,920
- There's always next year.
- So that's it? It's over?

1323
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:23,890
Clear!

1324
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:25,460
James!

1325
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:29,090
- Clear!
- Fuck it!

1326
01:41:33,470 --> 01:41:36,269
<i>James Hunt rejoins the
race in sixth position.</i>

1327
01:41:36,270 --> 01:41:40,510
<i>There are four laps to go.
Surely no way back for the Brit.</i>

1328
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:01,799
Concentrate, Superstar.

1329
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:03,799
<i>Just brings it back
under control!</i>

1330
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:06,770
<i>Sliding the McLaren on
the very edge there.</i>

1331
01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:11,539
<i>Hunt's M23 twitching this
way and that under braking.</i>

1332
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:12,909
<i>And he almost loses
it right there.</i>

1333
01:42:12,910 --> 01:42:14,509
<i>Hunt on the tail
of Jacques Lafitte</i>

1334
01:42:14,510 --> 01:42:16,070
<i>in the blue Ligier.</i>

1335
01:42:23,690 --> 01:42:25,450
Don't do it, James.

1336
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:29,729
<i>He's inches away
from the pit wall!</i>

1337
01:42:29,730 --> 01:42:31,850
<i>He's inches away
from the Ligier!</i>

1338
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,009
<i>James Hunt has made
up another place,</i>

1339
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:46,170
<i>but it's not enough and
this race is running out.</i>

1340
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:57,550
<i>And Watson has spun!
Watson has spun!</i>

1341
01:43:00,890 --> 01:43:03,929
<i>Hunt manages to weave his
way between the back marker</i>

1342
01:43:03,930 --> 01:43:06,199
<i>and the stationary Penske.</i>

1343
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,829
<i>He's catching Regazzoni,
but in these conditions,</i>

1344
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:12,460
<i>it's one thing to catch up,
quite another to overtake.</i>

1345
01:43:15,610 --> 01:43:18,169
<i>He's alongside Clay Regazzoni!
This could be</i>

1346
01:43:18,170 --> 01:43:20,110
<i>the world championship!</i>

1347
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:29,510
<i>He's got him!</i>

1348
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:46,799
<i>Hunt crosses the line.</i>

1349
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,909
<i>He needed to finish third
to score enough points</i>

1350
01:43:49,910 --> 01:43:51,509
<i>to be World Champion,</i>

1351
01:43:51,510 --> 01:43:53,839
<i>and in the confusion
here we're being told</i>

1352
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,579
<i>that he may have finished 5th.</i>

1353
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:56,710
He finished fifth?

1354
01:43:57,950 --> 01:44:00,549
<i>Our lap charts show
Hunt in third place.</i>

1355
01:44:00,550 --> 01:44:02,419
<i>Well, if the scoreboard's right,</i>

1356
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:05,059
<i>it means he's just missed
out on the championship.</i>

1357
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:08,680
<i>Crushing defeat for Hunt
after such a heroic drive.</i>

1358
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:14,929
<i>I can see the race
stewards conferring,</i>

1359
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:17,199
<i>examining the
official lap charts.</i>

1360
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:20,430
<i>We're just going to have to
wait for their verdict here.</i>

1361
01:44:37,090 --> 01:44:38,559
Let's get you out
of here, buddy.

1362
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,819
I'm sorry, Teddy. I thought
I could make up the ground.

1363
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:42,929
Sony? What are you talking about?
You did it!

1364
01:44:42,930 --> 01:44:45,829
- Did what?
- Jesus! You crazy bastard!

1365
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:48,469
You came 3rd! You
got the points!

1366
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:50,099
You're champion of the world!

1367
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:53,139
<i>James Hunt is now
officially confirmed</i>

1368
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:55,739
<i>as finishing third
here in Japan,</i>

1369
01:44:55,740 --> 01:44:59,000
<i>and that means he is
champion of the world.</i>

1370
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:03,409
<i>Our new World
Champion, James Hunt,</i>

1371
01:45:03,410 --> 01:45:05,940
<i>by just one single point.</i>

1372
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,660
<i>Did we really win?</i>

1373
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:18,890
World bloody Champion!

1374
01:45:27,670 --> 01:45:31,540
- What are you going to do now?
- I shall be getting drunk.

1375
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:34,980
It's wonderful, absolute dream.

1376
01:46:21,490 --> 01:46:25,129
<i>And our special guest, Formula
1 champion, James Hunt.</i>

1377
01:46:25,130 --> 01:46:27,790
JAMES HUNT WORLD CHAMPION

1378
01:46:37,710 --> 01:46:39,730
JAMES HUNT AGAINST ALL ODDS

1379
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:51,610
Wait. Come on.

1380
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:57,520
There's no better motor
oil than Havoline.

1381
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,709
- Yes, me too. Where we going?
- Anywhere I want to go.

1382
01:47:11,710 --> 01:47:14,179
And I don't have to
hijack it, either.

1383
01:47:14,180 --> 01:47:16,449
As long as I pay for it.

1384
01:47:16,450 --> 01:47:18,880
I'm starving. Let's
get some food.

1385
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:26,950
BOLOGNA, ITALY

1386
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:31,529
- Where are you going?
- You lot go ahead.

1387
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:33,430
I won't be a minute.

1388
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:35,930
Niki!

1389
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:40,430
Good to see you!

1390
01:47:44,740 --> 01:47:46,709
I heard you were spending
more and more time

1391
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:48,949
- in one of these.
- Do you fly?

1392
01:47:48,950 --> 01:47:49,949
No.

1393
01:47:49,950 --> 01:47:52,679
- I don't think they'd insure me.
- You should try.

1394
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:53,919
It's good for discipline.

1395
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,489
You have to stay
within the rules,

1396
01:47:55,490 --> 01:47:57,189
stick to regulation,
suppress the ego.

1397
01:47:57,190 --> 01:47:59,119
It helps with the racing.

1398
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:01,859
And there I was thinking you
were about to wax lyrical

1399
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:05,420
- about the romance of flight.
- No, that's all bullshit.

1400
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:08,769
So what brings you here?

1401
01:48:08,770 --> 01:48:10,529
A friend's wedding.

1402
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:11,869
At least I think
it was a wedding.

1403
01:48:11,870 --> 01:48:13,099
Might have been a
birthday or something.

1404
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:14,769
It's all a bit of a blur.

1405
01:48:14,770 --> 01:48:17,669
- Have you been at Fiorano?
- Pre-season testing.

1406
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:19,639
- You're relentless.
- Thank you.

1407
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:21,579
I'm not sure that was
meant as a compliment.

1408
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:24,449
When do you start testing?
Next week?

1409
01:48:24,450 --> 01:48:26,149
No. What, are you nuts?

1410
01:48:26,150 --> 01:48:27,779
I didn't just win the
biggest thing of my life

1411
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:30,090
so I could get right
back to work.

1412
01:48:30,490 --> 01:48:32,730
Why? You have to.

1413
01:48:33,190 --> 01:48:35,119
To prove to all the people

1414
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:36,959
who will always say you
just won it because...

1415
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:40,400
Because of what? Because
of your accident?

1416
01:48:41,530 --> 01:48:44,469
Niki, is that other
people or is that you?

1417
01:48:44,470 --> 01:48:45,869
I won, okay?

1418
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:47,669
On the all-important day
when it came down to it,

1419
01:48:47,670 --> 01:48:50,609
we raced on equal terms,
equally good cars.

1420
01:48:50,610 --> 01:48:52,839
And I put my life on the
line and I saw it through.

1421
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:54,879
- And you call that winning?
- Yes.

1422
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:57,509
The risks were totally
unacceptable.

1423
01:48:57,510 --> 01:48:59,179
You were prepared to die.

1424
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:01,719
- To me, that's losing.
- Yes, I was. I admit it.

1425
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:04,549
I was prepared to die
to beat you that day.

1426
01:49:04,550 --> 01:49:06,559
And that's the effect
you have on me.

1427
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:09,620
You'd pushed me that far.
And it felt great!

1428
01:49:10,130 --> 01:49:12,759
I mean, hell, isn't that
what we're in this for?

1429
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:15,560
To stare death in the
face and to cheat it?

1430
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:18,569
Come on, there's
nobility in that.

1431
01:49:18,570 --> 01:49:20,470
It's like being knights.

1432
01:49:20,770 --> 01:49:23,169
You English, you're
such assholes.

1433
01:49:23,170 --> 01:49:25,439
You know my position.

1434
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:26,679
20% risk.

1435
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:29,449
No, Niki, don't bring the
percentages into this.

1436
01:49:29,450 --> 01:49:30,909
Don't be a pro.

1437
01:49:30,910 --> 01:49:33,649
The minute you do that, you
kill what's good about this.

1438
01:49:33,650 --> 01:49:35,410
You kill the sport.

1439
01:49:38,450 --> 01:49:39,420
James!

1440
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:41,410
James!

1441
01:49:45,090 --> 01:49:46,620
I've got to go.

1442
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:50,160
Careful in this thing.

1443
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:52,190
James.

1444
01:49:57,810 --> 01:50:01,400
In hospital, the toughest part
of my treatment was the vacuum.

1445
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:03,949
Pumping the shit
out of my lungs.

1446
01:50:03,950 --> 01:50:05,470
It was hell.

1447
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:08,519
And while doing it, I was
watching television.

1448
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:11,449
- You winning all my points.
- Your points?

1449
01:50:11,450 --> 01:50:14,459
"That bastard, Hunt," I'd say.
"I hate that guy."

1450
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:16,229
And one day, the
doctor came and said,

1451
01:50:16,230 --> 01:50:18,859
"Mr. Lauda, may I offer
a piece of advice?"

1452
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:21,099
"Stop thinking of it as a
curse to have been given

1453
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:22,699
an enemy in life."

1454
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:24,699
"It can be blessing too."

1455
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:26,269
"A wise man gets more
from his enemies

1456
01:50:26,270 --> 01:50:28,169
than a fool from his friends."

1457
01:50:28,170 --> 01:50:30,940
And you know what? He was right.

1458
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:34,179
Look at us.

1459
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:36,879
We were both a pair
of kids when we met.

1460
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,149
Hot-headed jerks in Formula 3.

1461
01:50:39,150 --> 01:50:42,240
Disowned by our families.
Headed nowhere.

1462
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:45,789
And now we're both
champions of the world.

1463
01:50:45,790 --> 01:50:47,480
It was not bad.

1464
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:49,889
No, it's not bad.

1465
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:52,059
So don't let me down now.

1466
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:53,959
I need you busting my balls.

1467
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:56,960
- Get back to work.
- I will, Niki, I will.

1468
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:59,869
But I intend to
enjoy myself first.

1469
01:50:59,870 --> 01:51:02,439
Some of life needs
to be for pleasure.

1470
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:05,639
What's the point of having a
million cups, medals and planes

1471
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:08,110
if you don't have any fun?

1472
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:10,840
How is that winning?

1473
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:14,649
- James!
- We're gonna leave without you!

1474
01:51:14,650 --> 01:51:15,640
James!

1475
01:51:19,790 --> 01:51:21,950
I'll see you on race day, champ.

1476
01:51:22,990 --> 01:51:24,150
You will...

1477
01:51:24,590 --> 01:51:25,560
champ.

1478
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:29,969
You look good, Niki.

1479
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:33,830
The only guy to have burnt his
face and it be an improvement.

1480
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:42,440
<i>Of course he didn't
listen to me.</i>

1481
01:51:42,710 --> 01:51:45,949
<i>For James, one world
title was enough.</i>

1482
01:51:45,950 --> 01:51:48,940
<i>He had proved what
he needed to prove,</i>

1483
01:51:49,220 --> 01:51:52,780
<i>to himself and anyone
who doubted him.</i>

1484
01:51:53,690 --> 01:51:56,559
<i>And two years later he retired.</i>

1485
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:59,760
<i>When I saw him next in
London seven years later,</i>

1486
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:02,199
<i>me as champion again,</i>

1487
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:03,929
<i>him as broadcaster,</i>

1488
01:52:03,930 --> 01:52:07,840
<i>he was barefoot on a
bicycle, with a flat tyre.</i>

1489
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:11,570
<i>Still living each
day like his last.</i>

1490
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:16,580
<i>When I heard he'd died aged
45, of a heart attack,</i>

1491
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:18,850
<i>I wasn't surprised.</i>

1492
01:52:19,450 --> 01:52:21,470
<i>I was just sad.</i>

1493
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:24,950
<i>People always think
of us as rivals,</i>

1494
01:52:25,490 --> 01:52:28,690
<i>but he was among the
very few I liked</i>

1495
01:52:29,530 --> 01:52:32,430
<i>and even fewer that I respected.</i>

1496
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:38,690
<i>He remains the only
person I envied.</i>

1497
01:52:47,370 --> 01:52:47,870
Born3o.
