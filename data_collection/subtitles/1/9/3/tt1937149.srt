1
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:35,956
THE BODY

2
00:02:40,706 --> 00:02:45,163
Yes?

3
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:49,080
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

4
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,913
No, I'll take my car.

5
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:56,914
I landed 3 hours ago.
I don't mind driving.

6
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,747
Then we'll go in yours.

7
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:04,748
Sure, don't be a bore.
Just hang up. See you soon.

8
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:20,872
It wasn't my idea to call you.
Technically you're on duty...

9
00:03:20,873 --> 00:03:21,872
What happened?

10
00:03:21,873 --> 00:03:23,788
We're still not sure.

11
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:26,997
- How was Berlin?
- Fine. What have we got?

12
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,330
A guy got run over,
he's in a coma.

13
00:03:30,331 --> 00:03:31,330
How's Eva?

14
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:33,288
She's in Berlin.
Tell me what you know.

15
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:35,497
You haven't seen your daughter
in 4 years...

16
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:36,538
2 and a half.

17
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,497
...and you go to Berlin
and fuck it up?

18
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:41,455
- I didn't fuck it up, it was fine.
- Then why the long face?

19
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:46,456
Will you stop busting my balls
and tell me what we're doing here?

20
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:52,538
His name's Angel Torres.
Skull injury and cervical fractures.

21
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:56,372
The doctors have stabilized him
but don't know when he'll come to.

22
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:59,413
The driver says he was on the road,

23
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:01,372
he couldn't swerve to miss him.

24
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:03,330
- Blood alcohol?
- Negative.

25
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:07,372
We only have his tracks in the woods.
He was running away.

26
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:10,372
From what? Why was he running
in the woods at night?

27
00:04:10,373 --> 00:04:12,663
He works at the Forensics Institute.

28
00:04:12,664 --> 00:04:14,663
The morgue?

29
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:19,664
He's the night guard.

30
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:54,788
Torres fled his post around 8:30.

31
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:57,663
He left via the security fence
and ran through the woods.

32
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,247
The morgue people told us
that some guards panic

33
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:02,872
when the alarms go off
in the refrigerated rooms.

34
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:04,163
But that's not the case.

35
00:05:04,164 --> 00:05:08,997
No. Torres has been here for 3 years
and no alarm went off.

36
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:11,413
All we have is a phone call.

37
00:05:11,414 --> 00:05:13,705
He called us minutes before
he was run over.

38
00:05:13,706 --> 00:05:17,038
He wanted a patrol car to come.
He was jumpy and didn't say why.

39
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,497
They put him through to Carlos,
who was on duty,

40
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:23,080
but he'd already gone.
They called again, but no reply.

41
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:25,413
- Why?
- We don't know.

42
00:05:25,414 --> 00:05:27,080
Was anyone else in the building?

43
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:32,081
The doors to the morgue shut at 8.
Torres is the only night staff.

44
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:35,205
So we have no fucking idea
what happened.

45
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:38,413
The only reason the guard
may have panicked and run off

46
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:40,288
is some kind of sick joke.

47
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:45,289
According to the register,
a body is missing.

48
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:57,038
The missing body is a woman,
Mayka Villaverde.

49
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,372
Cause of death: heart attack.
Autopsy pending.

50
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:03,288
Who signed the death certificate?

51
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:07,288
Dr. Tapia. No other forensic
had Contact with the body.

52
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:12,289
We've already informed her.

53
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:33,163
The Circuit's been disconnected.

54
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:36,330
All the cameras are out except one.

55
00:06:36,331 --> 00:06:41,331
I've paused the recording.

56
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:44,997
Something's grabbed his attention.
No alarm went off,

57
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:49,538
so we think this is when
the security cameras went out.

58
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,747
He left his post for 5 minutes.

59
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:56,748
When he came back,
this is what happened.

60
00:07:06,748 --> 00:07:09,788
All the cameras are out except one.

61
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:12,288
Why?

62
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:16,413
Whoever did this is inept
or is playing with us.

63
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:18,038
You think he's still here?

64
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,163
I don't know,
but I want the building surrounded.

65
00:07:22,164 --> 00:07:24,455
The woods too.

66
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:29,247
Take care of it. Okay, Norma?

67
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:32,372
Something happened
to make the guard to run away,

68
00:07:32,373 --> 00:07:35,205
and unless we believe
the dead can walk,

69
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:37,413
someone got in
and stole the corpse.

70
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:40,913
- Are you sure no one broke in?
- No. I'm quite sure.

71
00:07:40,914 --> 00:07:43,788
But we can't get into
the security room,

72
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:45,788
someone's changed the code.

73
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:50,789
The science team.

74
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:55,288
- You talk to them.
- Okay.

75
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:57,413
What do we know about her?

76
00:07:57,414 --> 00:08:01,205
Married to Alex Ulloa,
director of Farmatech,

77
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:04,830
a pharmaceutical lab
that she owns.

78
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:09,580
She also had controlling shares
in some thriving technological firms.

79
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:11,247
No children.

80
00:08:11,248 --> 00:08:15,955
And she owned other businesses
with her two sisters,

81
00:08:15,956 --> 00:08:18,955
Luna and Gloria Villaverde.

82
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:23,956
The report says she just came back
from a business trip to L.A.

83
00:08:24,123 --> 00:08:27,330
A powerful woman.

84
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:29,497
Mayka Villaverde Freire,

85
00:08:29,498 --> 00:08:31,788
do you take Alex Ulloa Marcos

86
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:36,789
as your lawful wedded husband
till death do you part?

87
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:42,664
No.

88
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:48,080
I don't want to marry you, Alex.

89
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:50,830
- What do you mean?
- Not like this.

90
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:55,205
My whole family's here!

91
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:58,788
Mayka, please...

92
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:01,122
Darling!

93
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:06,123
Of course I do!

94
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:14,997
Only she could do that
and get us to applaud.

95
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:18,247
And the groom to kiss her.

96
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:22,788
I'll get it.

97
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:24,080
Yes?

98
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:26,413
Hello, Dad.

99
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:28,830
No, you'd better call him tomorrow.

100
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,913
He's in the bedroom.
He doesn't want to talk to anyone.

101
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:35,788
He's shattered.

102
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:38,955
He found her
when he got back from the lab.

103
00:09:38,956 --> 00:09:41,080
A heart attack.

104
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,622
Mum's dress was perfect on her.

105
00:09:44,623 --> 00:09:46,497
Mayka was perfect.

106
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:51,498
<i>You may kiss the bride.</i>

107
00:10:03,456 --> 00:10:08,456
Alex.

108
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:12,663
Alex.

109
00:10:12,664 --> 00:10:17,664
Dad called.
He sends you a kiss.

110
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:23,663
We'll leave you alone, okay?

111
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:28,664
I need to rest.

112
00:11:34,748 --> 00:11:36,330
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't take any more.

113
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:39,705
- You could've called.
- Nobody saw me.

114
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:44,706
Is something wrong?

115
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,330
- Is everything alright?
- Yes.

116
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:51,080
- It's done. I did it for you.
- There's no going back.

117
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:56,081
I'm free to be with you.
We're free.

118
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:15,164
- What can I get you?
- I don't care, whatever you're having.

119
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:23,080
What were you doing?

120
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:27,122
Nothing.

121
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:28,872
Thinking.

122
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:33,873
- About what?
- What do you think?

123
00:12:59,123 --> 00:13:01,288
Why don't you answer it?

124
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:04,872
I don't know who it is.
The condolences keep coming.

125
00:13:04,873 --> 00:13:06,455
It's unbearable.

126
00:13:06,456 --> 00:13:11,456
At this hour?

127
00:13:11,664 --> 00:13:14,163
Yes?

128
00:13:14,164 --> 00:13:16,455
Yes, that's me.

129
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:19,497
Don't worry, I was awake.

130
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:24,498
I spoke to your colleague.
This afternoon, yes.

131
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,747
What do you mean "disappeared"?

132
00:13:40,748 --> 00:13:45,748
That's impossible, it's...

133
00:13:45,998 --> 00:13:48,288
Alright, alright. Thanks.

134
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:50,788
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

135
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:53,247
- Who was that?
- The police.

136
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:56,455
- Didn't you speak to them already?
- Mayka's disappeared.

137
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:57,330
What?

138
00:13:57,331 --> 00:14:00,372
Her body's disappeared
from the morgue.

139
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,247
- Disappeared? How?
- Disappeared. I don't know.

140
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:05,913
- She is dead, isn't she?
- Of course she is.

141
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:08,913
Are you sure?

142
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,705
I know what I did and how.
She's dead.

143
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:13,913
Someone must've taken her.

144
00:14:13,914 --> 00:14:18,788
I don't know, I only know
what the police are saying.

145
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:23,789
Maybe it's a mistake,
they'll probably apologize.

146
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:34,080
- Do you have to go?
- Of course I do.

147
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,288
Don't go.

148
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:39,788
It might be dangerous. What if
they're suspicious and it's a trap?

149
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:42,413
They've no reason to be suspicious.

150
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,663
But if I don't go, they might be.

151
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:49,747
Come here.

152
00:14:49,748 --> 00:14:54,748
Be careful.

153
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:06,539
Go on, you can go through.

154
00:15:12,331 --> 00:15:16,455
We're sorry to call you
with such terrible news

155
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:19,622
and for getting you down here.
Thank you so much.

156
00:15:19,623 --> 00:15:23,247
What's happened, exactly?

157
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:27,247
Our first hypothesis...

158
00:15:27,248 --> 00:15:31,413
is that someone's taken the body.

159
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:33,913
How can this happen?

160
00:15:33,914 --> 00:15:37,122
Isn't this place meant to be secure?
There are human beings here.

161
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:39,288
There's 24-hour surveillance.

162
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:43,455
It's what happened to
the night guard that alerted us.

163
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:46,330
He was run over
as he fled the morgue in fear.

164
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:47,497
In fear?

165
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:51,163
It seems he saw something
related to your wife's disappearance.

166
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:52,955
We don't know what.

167
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:55,080
He ran away
and was run over by a car.

168
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:57,205
He's now in a coma
at Sacred Heart.

169
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,455
Where's the sense in this?
Has it happened before?

170
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:03,913
There have been cases of vandalism
and organ trafficking,

171
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:06,038
but we ruled those out.

172
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,538
Vandals leave all kinds of traces

173
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:12,705
and organ traffickers
don't take just one body.

174
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:17,706
And, no offense, but usually
they prefer younger bodies.

175
00:16:18,998 --> 00:16:23,663
That leaves us
a Satanic cult, a sect.

176
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:28,122
Your wife didn't look like
a sect member.

177
00:16:28,123 --> 00:16:31,455
No, of course not.

178
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:36,456
Then it has to be more personal...

179
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:42,955
someone wishing to harm your wife,
even after she was dead.

180
00:16:42,956 --> 00:16:46,997
Did she have problems with anyone,
enemies of any kind?

181
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:49,163
Mayka didn't have any problems
with anyone.

182
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:51,788
She was a powerful woman,
owned companies.

183
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:53,122
You can't think of anyone?

184
00:16:53,123 --> 00:16:55,497
To do something so horrific,
of course not.

185
00:16:55,498 --> 00:16:58,038
What about you?

186
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,205
What about me?

187
00:16:59,206 --> 00:17:03,205
It sounds twisted,
but would anyone want to hurt you

188
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:05,872
with something as macabre
as making your wife vanish?

189
00:17:05,873 --> 00:17:09,122
I've no idea why this is happening.
I have no enemies.

190
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:14,122
If it's not you, perhaps they want
to hurt some family member.

191
00:17:14,123 --> 00:17:17,997
- You should ask Mayka's sisters.
- We've done that.

192
00:17:17,998 --> 00:17:19,497
Did you call them before me?

193
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:24,498
We located them at home,
but neither of them knows anything.

194
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:27,705
The lawyer...

195
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:30,205
Gloria.

196
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:33,038
...gave us these papers.

197
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,663
We might find something,
and we might not.

198
00:17:36,664 --> 00:17:39,997
Of course we tried to find you first,

199
00:17:39,998 --> 00:17:41,872
but you weren't home,

200
00:17:41,873 --> 00:17:44,913
so we called your mobile.

201
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:47,455
Gloria gave us your number.

202
00:17:47,456 --> 00:17:52,456
I went out for some painkillers,
my head was about to explode.

203
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:55,455
Feeling any better?

204
00:17:55,456 --> 00:18:00,247
Yes. Thanks a lot.

205
00:18:00,248 --> 00:18:05,248
Dr. Tapia's here.

206
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:12,873
We'll be right back.

207
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:35,205
Yes?

208
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:36,872
<i>Why didn't you pick up?</i>

209
00:18:36,873 --> 00:18:40,288
I'm sorry, I thought the police
might have your mobile.

210
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:42,330
Nobody took my mobile.
Everything's fine.

211
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,413
<i>Has she turned up?</i>

212
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,663
No, but she will.
I need you to do something.

213
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:47,497
What do you want me to do?

214
00:18:47,498 --> 00:18:50,080
<i>The guard saw something,
ran away and got run over.</i>

215
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:51,913
<i>He's unconscious in Intensive Care.</i>

216
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:55,205
<i>The police say they don't know
what he saw, but I don't trust them.</i>

217
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:57,205
<i>Do you know anyone
at Sacred Heart?</i>

218
00:18:57,206 --> 00:18:58,955
Alex, what are you asking?

219
00:18:58,956 --> 00:19:01,455
The guard's there.
Do you know someone or not?

220
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:03,455
<i>I did practicals there last year.</i>

221
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:06,913
Go there and find out what you can
without raising any suspicion.

222
00:19:06,914 --> 00:19:09,455
Can't you go?
You must know people at their lab.

223
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:11,955
I can't move from here.

224
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:14,747
- Are you under arrest?
- Of course not.

225
00:19:14,748 --> 00:19:18,413
<i>But they want to question me.
I'll call when I can. Love you. Ciao.</i>

226
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:23,414
I love you t...

227
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:36,330
You can't smoke here.

228
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:39,288
In this situation
can't you turn a blind eye?

229
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:42,413
The forensic wants to talk to you.

230
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,080
In your statement you say

231
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:48,247
your wife returned from L.A.
this morning. Is that right?

232
00:19:48,248 --> 00:19:51,163
- Yes. A business trip.
- I see she had a fear of flying.

233
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:54,955
She'd done various therapies. Why?

234
00:19:54,956 --> 00:19:59,788
Stress on long flights
can cause cardiac arrest.

235
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:02,580
You think Mayka had a cardiac
because of the trip?

236
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:04,538
There is that possibility.

237
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:08,705
Though we have no record
of any cardiovascular hazard.

238
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:11,080
Perhaps it wasn't detected.

239
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:15,038
I don't know, you're the expert.

240
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,039
Mayka thought she was invincible.
Perhaps that takes its toll.

241
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:26,789
Perhaps.

242
00:20:28,748 --> 00:20:32,163
But without an autopsy
it's impossible to verify.

243
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:35,122
Any schizophrenic episode?

244
00:20:35,123 --> 00:20:35,997
No.

245
00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:37,913
- Parkinson's?
- Not that either.

246
00:20:37,914 --> 00:20:39,038
Epilepsy?

247
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,622
It's all in her medical file.
I don't get it.

248
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:44,663
The doctors didn't live with her.
You did.

249
00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:48,580
I don't get what this has to do
with my wife's disappearance.

250
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:52,913
I'd like to rule out a theory
that'd explain what happened.

251
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:55,288
What?

252
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:56,747
Catalepsy.

253
00:20:56,748 --> 00:21:01,748
What did you say?

254
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,413
Alright, Silvia...

255
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:12,122
Do you really think it's possible
the corpse wasn't a corpse?

256
00:21:12,123 --> 00:21:15,080
I certified her death
and I did my job properly,

257
00:21:15,081 --> 00:21:17,747
but circumstances force me
to reconsider everything.

258
00:21:17,748 --> 00:21:19,872
It makes no sense.
If she woke up,

259
00:21:19,873 --> 00:21:22,455
why not cry out for help?
Why disappear?

260
00:21:22,456 --> 00:21:25,788
He's right. It's more logical
that someone came for her.

261
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:28,330
And from a medical viewpoint,
more probable.

262
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:32,080
Then let's return to the 21st century
and assume that the cause of death

263
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:35,372
was heart attack,
as in your preliminary report.

264
00:21:35,373 --> 00:21:40,080
The question is:
why was the body taken?

265
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:43,538
There's a principle
in forensic medicine:

266
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:47,788
"Every death is a homicide
until proven otherwise. "

267
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:49,872
Cardiac arrest can be induced

268
00:21:49,873 --> 00:21:52,663
by submitting a person
to extreme tension.

269
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:57,080
Or administering substances
that have the same result.

270
00:21:57,081 --> 00:21:59,955
But nothing's demonstrable
without an autopsy.

271
00:21:59,956 --> 00:22:04,956
And no body, no autopsy.

272
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,913
What did you think
when you spoke to him?

273
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:17,788
I was surprised
how he referred to his wife.

274
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:21,330
He spoke about her in the past,
with no hesitation.

275
00:22:21,331 --> 00:22:24,622
Ruth died several years ago...

276
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:29,623
and I still talk about her
as if she were alive.

277
00:22:32,206 --> 00:22:36,122
His wife died this afternoon.

278
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:41,123
I'll find out everything about him.

279
00:22:56,914 --> 00:23:01,622
I'm sorry you had to come
at this time of night.

280
00:23:01,623 --> 00:23:03,830
And in this weather.

281
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:06,747
Pablo tells me you came back
from a trip today,

282
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:11,748
to see Eva.

283
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:13,455
I hope she's alright.

284
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:15,163
She's fine.

285
00:23:15,164 --> 00:23:17,705
Or seems to be at least.

286
00:23:17,706 --> 00:23:20,372
And you?

287
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:22,580
How are you?

288
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:25,038
They told you everything.

289
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,913
I heard you were suspended again,

290
00:23:27,914 --> 00:23:29,622
you went into therapy again...

291
00:23:29,623 --> 00:23:32,413
I fell off the wagon.

292
00:23:32,414 --> 00:23:34,622
But I only drink coffee now.

293
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:38,247
7 months on coffee,
I'm a gourmet about it.

294
00:23:38,248 --> 00:23:40,955
Try switching to teas.

295
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:42,705
Your heart will thank you.

296
00:23:42,706 --> 00:23:47,038
My heart's withstood much worse.

297
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,497
You'd be doing yourself a favour
if you put it behind you.

298
00:23:50,498 --> 00:23:52,997
When will you stop blaming yourself?

299
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:56,580
It's been a long time.

300
00:23:56,581 --> 00:24:01,581
It was a night like tonight.

301
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:08,747
I'm alone now, Silvia.

302
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:12,205
No.

303
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:17,206
You're not.

304
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,872
What's wrong?

305
00:24:26,873 --> 00:24:29,913
- Where is everyone?
- Go back inside.

306
00:24:29,914 --> 00:24:31,830
- Have you seen the time?
- Yeah.

307
00:24:31,831 --> 00:24:34,497
- You know what a day I've had?
- We're working on...

308
00:24:34,498 --> 00:24:38,247
Listen, please.
Tell your boss I want to go home.

309
00:24:38,248 --> 00:24:43,248
Be patient.

310
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:47,788
<i>I'll see what's happening.</i>

311
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:49,538
Please, call your boss.

312
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:52,663
Please, Mr. Ulloa,
go back into the office.

313
00:24:52,664 --> 00:24:57,664
Thank you.

314
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:33,206
Mayka.

315
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:38,372
Thanks.

316
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:40,580
What about yours?

317
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:44,288
- It's 9 in the morning.
- Not in Los Angeles.

318
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:48,747
And I want to toast
to the trip's success.

319
00:27:48,748 --> 00:27:51,288
And...

320
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:56,289
...to my return.

321
00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:05,997
- Will this toast do you?
- No.

322
00:28:05,998 --> 00:28:10,163
The lab called, I have to go.

323
00:28:10,164 --> 00:28:12,372
Alex...

324
00:28:12,373 --> 00:28:16,580
<i>We've been apart for 3 weeks.
We have to talk.</i>

325
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:20,372
I've got a meeting.

326
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:23,705
You're the Director,
you can do what you like.

327
00:28:23,706 --> 00:28:27,330
No one can fire you.

328
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,205
Except me.

329
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:32,330
You know something?

330
00:28:32,331 --> 00:28:34,830
I don't like this kind of joke.

331
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:38,288
I work hard because
I take what I do very seriously.

332
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:40,955
And I do it because I like it.

333
00:28:40,956 --> 00:28:42,955
I know.

334
00:28:42,956 --> 00:28:47,830
That's why you're where you are,
and not teaching at a college.

335
00:28:47,831 --> 00:28:52,163
I don't want to leave angry.

336
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:57,164
See you later, okay?

337
00:29:38,873 --> 00:29:41,205
Hello. Cristina?

338
00:29:41,206 --> 00:29:44,955
Please call and tell them
Alex can't make the meeting.

339
00:29:44,956 --> 00:29:47,080
No, he's fine.

340
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:48,913
Mayka...
What are you doing?

341
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:52,038
What's more, he won't be
returning to the lab.

342
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,580
Get a letter of dismissal
ready for him.

343
00:29:53,581 --> 00:29:55,247
Mayka... Mayka!

344
00:29:55,248 --> 00:29:56,538
Of course!

345
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:59,372
- What are you doing?
- Of course I'm serious.

346
00:29:59,373 --> 00:30:03,455
It's my company. It's my decision
and I've just made it.

347
00:30:03,456 --> 00:30:08,456
Thanks.

348
00:30:08,956 --> 00:30:10,913
We'll sort it out this afternoon,

349
00:30:10,914 --> 00:30:14,205
but now we have
the whole morning to ourselves.

350
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:16,413
Come here...

351
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:21,414
Alex?

352
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,788
Darling!

353
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:29,080
I didn't speak to anyone!

354
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:34,081
You're like a child.

355
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:40,289
<i>I'll book a table somewhere
for dinner when you get out.</i>

356
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:43,997
You'll be sleepy...

357
00:30:43,998 --> 00:30:45,830
from the jet lag.

358
00:30:45,831 --> 00:30:48,288
I'll be awake.

359
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:51,622
Tell me when you want the table.

360
00:30:51,623 --> 00:30:54,830
Tonight...

361
00:30:54,831 --> 00:30:59,831
Tonight you will be mine.

362
00:31:08,164 --> 00:31:11,330
- Why'd you leave the office?
- What are you doing here?

363
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:13,955
I heard a noise.

364
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:17,622
The fuses blew,
but it's fixed now.

365
00:31:17,623 --> 00:31:21,413
What...?

366
00:31:21,414 --> 00:31:26,330
It's the box with
the deceased's personal items.

367
00:31:26,331 --> 00:31:31,331
They were in this locker.

368
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:36,538
The lock's been jimmied.

369
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,997
Were you searching through
your wife's things?

370
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,205
No, I didn't touch anything.

371
00:31:41,206 --> 00:31:46,206
According to the delivery note,
the mobile phone's missing.

372
00:31:46,248 --> 00:31:47,955
It was in here.

373
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:49,663
I didn't take anything.

374
00:31:49,664 --> 00:31:51,538
Who was it then?

375
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:52,997
One of the dead?

376
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:56,247
They got bored
and wanted to liven up our night?

377
00:31:56,248 --> 00:32:01,163
Empty your pockets.

378
00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:06,164
Why would I take my wife's mobile?

379
00:32:07,956 --> 00:32:12,956
Please, Mr. Ulloa.

380
00:32:14,331 --> 00:32:19,331
Incredible. Incredible.

381
00:32:28,123 --> 00:32:30,497
MY phone.

382
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:33,997
Thanks.

383
00:32:33,998 --> 00:32:38,998
Is that it?

384
00:32:41,914 --> 00:32:45,663
Arms up.

385
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:49,122
- What?
- Do as I say.

386
00:32:49,123 --> 00:32:50,913
- Why?
- I'm going to search you.

387
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:52,413
No.

388
00:32:52,414 --> 00:32:54,830
- Turn around.
- You've got no right.

389
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:57,747
Turn around! Fuck!

390
00:32:57,748 --> 00:33:01,497
What is this? What?

391
00:33:01,498 --> 00:33:04,872
- You've got no right.
- Fucking turn around!

392
00:33:04,873 --> 00:33:09,873
Jaime!

393
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,413
What's this?

394
00:33:29,414 --> 00:33:31,913
It was on the floor.
I was going to throw it out.

395
00:33:31,914 --> 00:33:35,955
No recycling? That's not nice.

396
00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:38,038
It has your lab's seal on it.

397
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:41,455
Our products go to these places.
Any cabinet will be full of them.

398
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:44,497
- What's TH-16?
- A toxin.

399
00:33:44,498 --> 00:33:45,330
What kind?

400
00:33:45,331 --> 00:33:47,538
I don't know,
we work with hundreds of them.

401
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:49,622
- What's it for?
- It'll have various applications.

402
00:33:49,623 --> 00:33:54,623
- Like what?
- It's not my specialty.

403
00:33:57,581 --> 00:34:02,581
It's his.

404
00:34:05,206 --> 00:34:07,622
Answer it.

405
00:34:07,623 --> 00:34:12,623
My sister.

406
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:13,955
Yes?

407
00:34:13,956 --> 00:34:15,913
I'm at the hospital.
The guard's name is Angel Torres.

408
00:34:15,914 --> 00:34:19,288
I'm fine. Mayka's still missing,
but the police will find her.

409
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:22,455
You can't talk. Something's wrong,
I can hear it in your voice.

410
00:34:22,456 --> 00:34:26,080
<i>Thanks, Erica. I'll call you later.</i>

411
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:28,247
Have we finished?

412
00:34:28,248 --> 00:34:31,247
We'll go over your statement,
then you can go home.

413
00:34:31,248 --> 00:34:36,248
Can I go to the bathroom first?

414
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:41,748
<i>I'll wait here.</i>

415
00:34:45,914 --> 00:34:46,830
<i>Alex...</i>

416
00:34:46,831 --> 00:34:48,913
I haven't much time.
What did you find out?

417
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:52,122
The guard's still unconscious,
they only know what you were told.

418
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,913
I know a nurse on that floor.

419
00:34:53,914 --> 00:34:56,372
She thinks I'm spending the night
with a relative.

420
00:34:56,373 --> 00:35:00,622
<i>She's on a break in 20 minutes.
I'm meeting her in a bar nearby.</i>

421
00:35:00,623 --> 00:35:03,163
I think somebody knows something.

422
00:35:03,164 --> 00:35:06,663
<i>- Who? The police?
- The police don't worry me.</i>

423
00:35:06,664 --> 00:35:10,205
Someone forced the locker with
Mayka's things and taken her phone.

424
00:35:10,206 --> 00:35:12,038
Fuck.

425
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:16,122
And the TH-16 I hid today
has turned up. The police have it.

426
00:35:16,123 --> 00:35:17,663
It's a trap.

427
00:35:17,664 --> 00:35:20,372
<i>- I told you not to go.
- I can handle the police.</i>

428
00:35:20,373 --> 00:35:25,372
How could anyone know anything?
Only you and I knew.

429
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,955
Did you talk to anyone?

430
00:35:26,956 --> 00:35:29,205
<i>- What'?
- I need to know.</i>

431
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:31,122
I didn't talk to anyone,
I'm not an idiot.

432
00:35:31,123 --> 00:35:33,122
Something's gone wrong.
I know what I'm doing.

433
00:35:33,123 --> 00:35:36,122
You lived with her. Your wife saw you
every day since you decided.

434
00:35:36,123 --> 00:35:39,788
We decided.
I've calculated my every move.

435
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:42,538
Maybe you talk in your sleep,
I don't know!

436
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:43,538
<i>What'll you do?</i>

437
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:46,247
Try to get out of here.
But think about what I said.

438
00:35:46,248 --> 00:35:49,497
We have to find out what happened
to Mayka and why. Alright?

439
00:35:49,498 --> 00:35:52,247
Alright. Alex...

440
00:35:52,248 --> 00:35:54,372
<i>I love you.</i>

441
00:35:54,373 --> 00:35:59,373
And I love you.

442
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:14,872
Dr. Tapia told me.

443
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:18,205
I'm sorry I didn't remember...

444
00:36:18,206 --> 00:36:22,205
...about Ruth.

445
00:36:22,206 --> 00:36:24,955
Why don't you go home?
I'll cover for you, nobody'll know.

446
00:36:24,956 --> 00:36:27,622
I lost it before.

447
00:36:27,623 --> 00:36:29,497
It won't happen again.

448
00:36:29,498 --> 00:36:34,498
That's what you said last time.

449
00:37:44,164 --> 00:37:49,164
BUSINESS CLUB ANNUAL DINNER
HOTEL TIVOLI, 8:30

450
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:54,248
I CLOSE MY EYES
AND YOU'RE STILL WITH ME

451
00:38:28,914 --> 00:38:33,914
I expected you earlier.

452
00:38:33,956 --> 00:38:35,830
Don't tell me...

453
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:40,831
- You forgot about the dinner.
- There was a setback at the lab.

454
00:38:41,123 --> 00:38:45,122
I called. Cristina said you weren't
at the lab all afternoon.

455
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:46,497
I went to get some samples.

456
00:38:46,498 --> 00:38:49,455
I was out of the office
and I couldn't advise Cristina.

457
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:51,872
I also called your mobile.

458
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:56,622
It was in my briefcase.
I left it in my car.

459
00:38:56,623 --> 00:39:00,580
I didn't see your calls, sorry.

460
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:02,997
Hold on.

461
00:39:02,998 --> 00:39:05,163
You have something...

462
00:39:05,164 --> 00:39:09,622
- What?
- Here.

463
00:39:09,623 --> 00:39:14,623
A freckle I've never seen before.

464
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:18,872
Put on that grey suit I got you.
You'll look so handsome.

465
00:39:18,873 --> 00:39:23,372
I was going to wear
the new blue one.

466
00:39:23,373 --> 00:39:28,373
I'll have a shower.
We can leave in 5 minutes.

467
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:39,289
I find it hard to accept...

468
00:39:46,581 --> 00:39:49,497
...that I'm not so young anymore.

469
00:39:49,498 --> 00:39:52,622
- We all get older.
- Sure.

470
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:57,623
But you're the one
who's starting to get home late.

471
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:03,664
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. The song made me sad.

472
00:40:05,456 --> 00:40:08,413
It made me think about us.

473
00:40:08,414 --> 00:40:10,372
And that makes you sad?

474
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:12,497
The idea of losing you...

475
00:40:12,498 --> 00:40:15,247
...makes me sad.

476
00:40:15,248 --> 00:40:19,372
- That's what the song's about.
- Tell me it's just a song!

477
00:40:19,373 --> 00:40:21,122
It's just a song.

478
00:40:21,123 --> 00:40:24,247
Tell me I'm not going to lose you.

479
00:40:24,248 --> 00:40:27,622
You'll never lose me, ever.

480
00:40:27,623 --> 00:40:32,623
Never.

481
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:26,039
I CLOSE MY EYES
AND YOU'RE STILL WITH ME.

482
00:42:11,873 --> 00:42:16,873
Mr. Ulloa?

483
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:23,455
- What are you doing?
- I'm nauseous.

484
00:42:23,456 --> 00:42:28,456
You have to come with me,
we have news.

485
00:42:34,248 --> 00:42:38,288
What the hell are you doing?

486
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:43,289
Fuck.

487
00:42:44,748 --> 00:42:46,413
Are you smoking?

488
00:42:46,414 --> 00:42:51,038
<i>- I'll be right out.
- You now you can't smoke here?</i>

489
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:54,830
Come out now, please.

490
00:42:54,831 --> 00:42:59,163
I'm coming.

491
00:42:59,164 --> 00:43:00,788
What is it?

492
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:05,789
A clue.

493
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:19,955
- Got the new code yet?
- I'm offended you ask.

494
00:43:19,956 --> 00:43:22,538
Jaime's inside now.
Pablo's still on the rooftop.

495
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:27,539
This way, Mr. Ulloa.

496
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:39,163
What do you want me to see?

497
00:43:39,164 --> 00:43:42,622
The inspector will fill you in.

498
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:47,623
Where are we?

499
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:57,372
The whole building
is controlled from here.

500
00:43:57,373 --> 00:44:00,330
The security cameras too.

501
00:44:00,331 --> 00:44:05,331
But there's a weak spot.

502
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:16,289
The air duct leads to the rooftop.

503
00:44:16,498 --> 00:44:19,288
It's been forced at both ends.

504
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:23,163
Someone got in here
to cut the surveillance circuits.

505
00:44:23,164 --> 00:44:26,538
He could've reached the fridge
and taken your wife's body.

506
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,788
- Pablo, do you read me?
- Norma, what is it?

507
00:44:28,789 --> 00:44:33,330
I'm at the emergency stairs
leading to the rooftop.

508
00:44:33,331 --> 00:44:35,747
We've found something.

509
00:44:35,748 --> 00:44:38,538
20 March, 2012.

510
00:44:38,539 --> 00:44:41,997
Does that date mean anything to you?

511
00:44:41,998 --> 00:44:43,913
No. Why?

512
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:48,914
Someone changed the date
on the calendar.

513
00:44:49,914 --> 00:44:54,914
Most likely the person
who took your wife's body.

514
00:44:55,164 --> 00:44:58,913
From here the only way out
is this security door.

515
00:44:58,914 --> 00:45:01,330
To do that,
you have to key in a code.

516
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:05,538
The control panel's been manipulated.

517
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:08,830
The code was changed tonight.

518
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,330
Guess what it is.

519
00:45:11,331 --> 00:45:16,331
<i>20-03-2012.</i>

520
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:24,539
<i>Access granted.</i>

521
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:54,623
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU
AT THE RESTAURANT - CARLA.

522
00:45:58,623 --> 00:46:02,830
Fuck, Mayka...

523
00:46:02,831 --> 00:46:04,955
What are you doing here?

524
00:46:04,956 --> 00:46:07,788
Nice to see you too.

525
00:46:07,789 --> 00:46:10,205
Cristina opened up for me.

526
00:46:10,206 --> 00:46:12,997
Don't you dare get mad at her.

527
00:46:12,998 --> 00:46:16,163
I thought you were
coming back tomorrow.

528
00:46:16,164 --> 00:46:18,830
I squeezed the meetings
into one day.

529
00:46:18,831 --> 00:46:23,831
I have to make a note
before I forget.

530
00:46:27,248 --> 00:46:31,497
I saw you.

531
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:33,997
Keying in the code.

532
00:46:33,998 --> 00:46:36,288
Were you spying on me?

533
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:38,163
Why did you choose that date?

534
00:46:38,164 --> 00:46:39,830
How do you know it's a date?

535
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:43,122
Darling...

536
00:46:43,123 --> 00:46:47,413
You put dates on everything.

537
00:46:47,414 --> 00:46:52,414
Even the bad days.

538
00:46:52,664 --> 00:46:54,247
It's a way of remembering.

539
00:46:54,248 --> 00:46:56,247
Some things are best forgotten.

540
00:46:56,248 --> 00:47:01,248
I like to remember.

541
00:47:07,164 --> 00:47:09,580
Are you going to tell me
what happened that day?

542
00:47:09,581 --> 00:47:12,330
We argued, and you know
I don't like arguing with you.

543
00:47:12,331 --> 00:47:17,331
Idon't like
being contradicted either.

544
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:27,206
Shall we have lunch?

545
00:47:27,456 --> 00:47:30,830
- You've got plans.
- You should've warned me.

546
00:47:30,831 --> 00:47:33,622
I can have lunch with you
and your plans.

547
00:47:33,623 --> 00:47:35,955
I'll cancel them
on the way to the restaurant.

548
00:47:35,956 --> 00:47:40,956
- Shall we go in your car?
- No.

549
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:51,413
Trust me.

550
00:47:51,414 --> 00:47:55,080
What are you doing?

551
00:47:55,081 --> 00:48:00,081
Beautiful day, isn't it?

552
00:48:00,289 --> 00:48:04,413
From now on I want us to enjoy
every beautiful day...

553
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:08,622
...like this.

554
00:48:08,623 --> 00:48:11,080
Mayka...

555
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:13,705
It's the one you liked.

556
00:48:13,706 --> 00:48:15,580
Black and chrome.

557
00:48:15,581 --> 00:48:18,247
- It's beautiful.
- Yes.

558
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:20,163
Cristina has the helmets.

559
00:48:20,164 --> 00:48:22,830
I want you to take
the first ride with me...

560
00:48:22,831 --> 00:48:27,831
...now.

561
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,622
Whoever took your wife's body

562
00:48:31,623 --> 00:48:34,830
got up to the morgue
via this goods lift.

563
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:38,122
And got the body out
using the same lift.

564
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:43,038
So, mystery solved.

565
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:46,622
We just need to find out who it was.

566
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:49,080
Do you have a clue?

567
00:48:49,081 --> 00:48:51,913
I've just been told that footprints
have been found

568
00:48:51,914 --> 00:48:56,538
near the emergency stairs
going up to the rooftop.

569
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:59,788
What's your shoe size?

570
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:03,455
- What?
- What's your shoe size?

571
00:49:03,456 --> 00:49:08,456
42.

572
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:17,289
Mateos here.
What the hell's going on?

573
00:49:29,414 --> 00:49:30,788
<i>Mateos, do you read me?</i>

574
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:34,663
<i>A fire somewhere in the building
set the alarms off.</i>

575
00:49:34,664 --> 00:49:38,288
Shit, man.

576
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:41,372
Everyone to the lobby.

577
00:49:41,373 --> 00:49:42,747
Come on. Oh, shit.

578
00:49:42,748 --> 00:49:44,330
Fuck!

579
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:46,038
Let's go!

580
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:51,039
This way.

581
00:50:04,998 --> 00:50:06,622
Carla, I can't talk now.

582
00:50:06,623 --> 00:50:09,122
<i>- Are you still there?
- Don't call again. It's dangerous.</i>

583
00:50:09,123 --> 00:50:12,497
Why?

584
00:50:12,498 --> 00:50:14,163
Where are you?
What's that noise?

585
00:50:14,164 --> 00:50:15,580
In the car.

586
00:50:15,581 --> 00:50:18,497
I went out for a smoke.
The guard's still unconscious.

587
00:50:18,498 --> 00:50:19,497
What's going on?

588
00:50:19,498 --> 00:50:21,830
I saw the numbers
on the security camera.

589
00:50:21,831 --> 00:50:25,372
It's the date when we met.

590
00:50:25,373 --> 00:50:29,497
<i>What security camera, Alex?
What are you saying? The date...?</i>

591
00:50:29,498 --> 00:50:33,997
<i>Alex, are you still there?</i>

592
00:50:33,998 --> 00:50:36,122
<i>Fuck, talk to me! Please!</i>

593
00:50:36,123 --> 00:50:37,247
<i>Alex!</i>

594
00:50:37,248 --> 00:50:42,248
I can feel her.

595
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,163
Mayka's still alive.

596
00:50:44,164 --> 00:50:47,455
<i>- You said that was impossible.
- You were right. I made a mistake.</i>

597
00:50:47,456 --> 00:50:49,247
She's toying with me.

598
00:50:49,248 --> 00:50:53,205
<i>- You said it was perfect.
- It was! I don't know how she did it.</i>

599
00:50:53,206 --> 00:50:55,038
<i>She can't be alive, Alex.</i>

600
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:56,872
"I close my eyes
and you're still with me".

601
00:50:56,873 --> 00:50:59,788
Mayka saw your message
on my mobile.

602
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:01,330
<i>How do you know?</i>

603
00:51:01,331 --> 00:51:03,538
If Mayka knows what we did,
you're in danger.

604
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:05,788
She's making them think I took
her body, she's incriminating me.

605
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:07,830
You were home
when she disappeared.

606
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:11,038
I was alone,
my sister only arrived after 9.

607
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:12,997
Mayka couldn't know all that.

608
00:51:12,998 --> 00:51:14,830
<i>- Maybe she has help.
- From whom?</i>

609
00:51:14,831 --> 00:51:17,663
I don't know, but her death was
certified. She can do what she likes.

610
00:51:17,664 --> 00:51:19,205
No one can accuse her.
Don't you see?

611
00:51:19,206 --> 00:51:21,372
Fuck the money.

612
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:25,747
Fuck it all. Get out of there
and we'll run away.

613
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:27,913
<i>Alex, do you hear me? Alex?</i>

614
00:51:27,914 --> 00:51:30,663
<i>I have to go.
I'll call you when I can.</i>

615
00:51:30,664 --> 00:51:35,664
Be careful. I love you.

616
00:51:39,914 --> 00:51:44,914
Let me guess.

617
00:51:46,831 --> 00:51:50,455
Your sister.

618
00:51:50,456 --> 00:51:52,622
She's worried.

619
00:51:52,623 --> 00:51:56,538
She thinks I should go home.

620
00:51:56,539 --> 00:51:59,705
Your mobile.

621
00:51:59,706 --> 00:52:04,706
Please.

622
00:52:10,873 --> 00:52:13,580
We haven't found out anything
from Ulloa's phone,

623
00:52:13,581 --> 00:52:15,205
no info of any use to us.

624
00:52:15,206 --> 00:52:17,997
He erased all incoming
and outgoing calls.

625
00:52:17,998 --> 00:52:20,747
I spoke to the company too,
but no luck.

626
00:52:20,748 --> 00:52:22,913
He's calling an unlisted number.

627
00:52:22,914 --> 00:52:25,080
It's impossible to know who it is.

628
00:52:25,081 --> 00:52:27,622
Any news on Norma?

629
00:52:27,623 --> 00:52:29,330
She just got back.

630
00:52:29,331 --> 00:52:31,247
The woods are a mess,

631
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:35,747
but a team's covering the perimeter
with sniffer dogs.

632
00:52:35,748 --> 00:52:39,038
They'll set out
when the storm's over.

633
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,788
Someone set off the fire alarm.

634
00:52:41,789 --> 00:52:44,705
Maybe by starting a fire
with a butt we found

635
00:52:44,706 --> 00:52:49,706
in the bathroom,
near the sensors.

636
00:52:49,873 --> 00:52:54,038
It must be his, I smelt smoke
when I went to get him.

637
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:57,622
The water flooded the area.
The scientists are going nuts.

638
00:52:57,623 --> 00:52:59,580
It's impossible to trace anything.

639
00:52:59,581 --> 00:53:01,580
Son of a bitch.

640
00:53:01,581 --> 00:53:05,122
That's not all.

641
00:53:05,123 --> 00:53:08,788
The report on TH-16 arrived.

642
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:13,455
It's a cardio-toxin,
very rarely used in medicines.

643
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:16,497
It's extracted from the fluids
of certain reptiles.

644
00:53:16,498 --> 00:53:18,497
Diluted in blood,

645
00:53:18,498 --> 00:53:23,498
it causes a cardiac 8 hours
after ingestion and leaves no trace.

646
00:53:23,956 --> 00:53:27,413
We need a transfer car.
I'm taking him to the station.

647
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:32,163
<i>I'll get right on it.</i>

648
00:53:32,164 --> 00:53:35,955
Put him in a locked room,
with constant surveillance.

649
00:53:35,956 --> 00:53:36,788
Alright.

650
00:53:36,789 --> 00:53:39,872
I'm going for a smoke,
I'll be right back.

651
00:53:39,873 --> 00:53:42,747
And this guy...

652
00:53:42,748 --> 00:53:47,748
- Take his cigarettes away.
- Okay.

653
00:54:00,831 --> 00:54:02,372
Did you lock it?

654
00:54:02,373 --> 00:54:05,663
Yes. There's just that door,
but I'm not going in there.

655
00:54:05,664 --> 00:54:10,664
And he can't get out.

656
00:55:04,748 --> 00:55:09,748
<i>Tonight you will be mine.</i>

657
00:57:16,373 --> 00:57:21,373
Mayka?

658
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:26,539
Mayka?

659
00:58:23,748 --> 00:58:24,872
<i>Mayka?</i>

660
00:58:24,873 --> 00:58:26,497
Is that you?

661
00:58:26,498 --> 00:58:28,247
<i>Who's this?</i>

662
00:58:28,248 --> 00:58:30,663
Who am I talking to?

663
00:58:30,664 --> 00:58:32,747
Patricia, at Arabesco.

664
00:58:32,748 --> 00:58:35,622
And no, Mayka's not here.
She forgot her phone...

665
00:58:35,623 --> 00:58:37,163
and I'm busy.

666
00:58:37,164 --> 00:58:40,955
- Wait, don't hang up!
- I'm fed up with this,

667
00:58:40,956 --> 00:58:44,538
so unless you can tell Mayka
to Contact us...

668
00:58:44,539 --> 00:58:47,580
Listen, you have to tell me
how you got this phone.

669
00:58:47,581 --> 00:58:50,663
<i>Mayka was my wife.
She died this afternoon.</i>

670
00:58:50,664 --> 00:58:53,163
<i>The last time I saw her,
she had her phone.</i>

671
00:58:53,164 --> 00:58:54,580
Excuse me?

672
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:57,663
<i>My wife's dead
and you have her phone.</i>

673
00:58:57,664 --> 00:58:59,788
The phone was left behind tonight.

674
00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:01,747
I need to know who left it.
What did they look like?

675
00:59:01,748 --> 00:59:04,163
I don't know,
it was left in the bathroom.

676
00:59:04,164 --> 00:59:06,497
<i>How do you know
it's my wife's phone?</i>

677
00:59:06,498 --> 00:59:08,747
She got calls!

678
00:59:08,748 --> 00:59:13,748
<i>Look at her contacts
and tell me the numbers.</i>

679
00:59:14,414 --> 00:59:16,080
<i>It's empty-</i>

680
00:59:16,081 --> 00:59:17,830
<i>Look...</i>

681
00:59:17,831 --> 00:59:20,455
Sorry about your wife,

682
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:22,872
but I can't help you, it's late

683
00:59:22,873 --> 00:59:25,038
<i>and I'm tired.</i>

684
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:27,955
Listen... Patricia.

685
00:59:27,956 --> 00:59:30,497
My wife and I came there a lot.

686
00:59:30,498 --> 00:59:33,913
If I describe her, you can tell me
if she or someone linked to her

687
00:59:33,914 --> 00:59:36,913
<i>left the phone.</i>

688
00:59:36,914 --> 00:59:39,622
You just said your wife was dead.

689
00:59:39,623 --> 00:59:41,330
I know, but...

690
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:43,830
Don't lie to me.
Don't drag me into your problems.

691
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:47,163
<i>I'm not lying.</i>

692
00:59:47,164 --> 00:59:51,080
My wife may be alive.
It's complicated.

693
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:55,913
See if the screen says "redirect".

694
00:59:55,914 --> 00:59:58,122
Yes, it does.

695
00:59:58,123 --> 00:59:59,413
<i>Hey...</i>

696
00:59:59,414 --> 01:00:04,372
<i>Hello?</i>

697
01:00:04,373 --> 01:00:08,288
Dickhead.

698
01:00:08,289 --> 01:00:13,289
Arabesco...

699
01:00:15,706 --> 01:00:17,163
Ready?

700
01:00:17,164 --> 01:00:19,622
Are you going to tell me
what we're celebrating?

701
01:00:19,623 --> 01:00:23,747
I got an agreement
to sign the takeover.

702
01:00:23,748 --> 01:00:26,247
In a couple of weeks
I'm going to L.A.

703
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:31,248
- You did it.
- Yes!

704
01:00:36,248 --> 01:00:38,413
Why don't you come with me?

705
01:00:38,414 --> 01:00:42,288
We could escape to Santa Catalina.

706
01:00:42,289 --> 01:00:45,038
We can book a room in Avalon.

707
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:50,039
We're about to test a new patent.

708
01:01:00,498 --> 01:01:05,498
Excuse me a moment.

709
01:01:26,331 --> 01:01:28,580
An appetizer while you're waiting?

710
01:01:28,581 --> 01:01:30,497
No, thanks, I'm fine.

711
01:01:30,498 --> 01:01:35,498
I'll be back shortly
to take your order.

712
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:53,788
Who's that?

713
01:01:53,789 --> 01:01:55,330
Nobody.

714
01:01:55,331 --> 01:01:58,997
Were you talking about me?

715
01:01:58,998 --> 01:02:03,497
You won't like it.

716
01:02:03,498 --> 01:02:05,372
He's my new lawyer.

717
01:02:05,373 --> 01:02:06,955
What's wrong with Gloria?

718
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:10,747
As well as being my sister,
she's also your lawyer,

719
01:02:10,748 --> 01:02:15,748
and I want to revise
our marriage contract.

720
01:02:18,539 --> 01:02:22,413
The property division.

721
01:02:22,414 --> 01:02:24,163
You can't be serious.

722
01:02:24,164 --> 01:02:27,538
I'm always serious with you.

723
01:02:27,539 --> 01:02:30,663
Even if I laugh at you constantly.

724
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:33,997
You want everyone
at your feet, don't you?

725
01:02:33,998 --> 01:02:36,497
Not everyone.

726
01:02:36,498 --> 01:02:41,498
You, yes.

727
01:02:43,789 --> 01:02:47,330
Got you!

728
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:49,122
You handed that to me
on a platter!

729
01:02:49,123 --> 01:02:53,913
It's not funny.

730
01:02:53,914 --> 01:02:57,830
If he's not your lawyer,
who is he?

731
01:02:57,831 --> 01:02:59,913
My psychoanalyst.

732
01:02:59,914 --> 01:03:02,205
I didn't know
you saw a psychoanalyst.

733
01:03:02,206 --> 01:03:04,413
There are...

734
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:09,414
lots of things
you don't know about me.

735
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:17,706
You really can't come?
You won't reconsider the trip?

736
01:03:52,289 --> 01:03:54,413
<i>- Yes'?
- Carla, it's me.</i>

737
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:56,455
Where are you calling from?

738
01:03:56,456 --> 01:03:57,705
<i>The police have my mobile.</i>

739
01:03:57,706 --> 01:04:02,706
They looked me in a room with
another phone, but it's no accident.

740
01:04:04,206 --> 01:04:06,913
<i>- What was that?
- I just got home.</i>

741
01:04:06,914 --> 01:04:10,788
I'll wait here until you get out,
then we'll run away.

742
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:12,538
What's no accident?

743
01:04:12,539 --> 01:04:16,747
The contact list
has only one number: Mayka's.

744
01:04:16,748 --> 01:04:18,747
<i>But her phone's still missing.</i>

745
01:04:18,748 --> 01:04:20,997
<i>Who does the phone belong to?</i>

746
01:04:20,998 --> 01:04:23,997
Javier Alonso. I don't know
who he is, but a few weeks ago

747
01:04:23,998 --> 01:04:27,122
Mayka saw a man in the restaurant
I just phoned called Arabesco.

748
01:04:27,123 --> 01:04:29,497
I don't get it.

749
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:31,747
Mayka's number
in this mobile's Contact list

750
01:04:31,748 --> 01:04:33,663
is calling a phone left in Arabesco.

751
01:04:33,664 --> 01:04:37,247
- Another forgotten mobile?
- Never mind.

752
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:40,705
Mayka said that man
was her psychoanalyst,

753
01:04:40,706 --> 01:04:42,580
but she was lying.

754
01:04:42,581 --> 01:04:45,247
Now she wants me
to make the link with her,

755
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:48,663
Arabesco, the forgotten phone
and that man.

756
01:04:48,664 --> 01:04:51,247
I think he's Javier Alonso.

757
01:04:51,248 --> 01:04:53,330
But I don't know how he fits in.

758
01:04:53,331 --> 01:04:57,372
<i>You have to help me.
His details are on your screen.</i>

759
01:04:57,373 --> 01:05:00,997
When we find out who Alonso is,
we'll discover Mayka's game.

760
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:05,998
Where'd you get that phone?

761
01:05:08,164 --> 01:05:10,830
I'm looking at the corpse
of Javier Alonso.

762
01:05:10,831 --> 01:05:13,080
The mobile was in his body bag.

763
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:15,538
Help me find out
who Javier Alonso was

764
01:05:15,539 --> 01:05:17,538
<i>and we'll get out of this.</i>

765
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:22,539
I'll tell you something.

766
01:05:47,873 --> 01:05:51,330
Where's Eva?

767
01:05:51,331 --> 01:05:53,747
Under observation.

768
01:05:53,748 --> 01:05:57,830
You'd better go back to her.

769
01:05:57,831 --> 01:06:02,831
I'm going in.

770
01:06:37,248 --> 01:06:41,538
<i>She's so pretty.
Go to Mummy.</i>

771
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,955
<i>Oh, my girl... Hello, Eva.</i>

772
01:06:43,956 --> 01:06:48,956
<i>Blow, sweetie.</i>

773
01:06:49,456 --> 01:06:51,580
<i>Look, Daddy,
look at me do it.</i>

774
01:06:51,581 --> 01:06:56,581
<i>Okay, honey, be careful.</i>

775
01:08:00,831 --> 01:08:05,122
I'll talk to Pea
and then let you know.

776
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:09,413
The papers from Gloria Villaverde.

777
01:08:09,414 --> 01:08:14,122
The last page.

778
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:17,538
As well as being her lawyer,
she also did the accounting.

779
01:08:17,539 --> 01:08:21,455
We checked details on this invoice,
but we haven't found him yet.

780
01:08:21,456 --> 01:08:24,122
He's not answering
his home phone or his mobile.

781
01:08:24,123 --> 01:08:26,830
His office is in his home.
I'll go there with a team.

782
01:08:26,831 --> 01:08:31,831
We're leaving now.

783
01:08:36,123 --> 01:08:37,955
Am I under arrest?

784
01:08:37,956 --> 01:08:40,913
I can hold you
until your wife's body turns up.

785
01:08:40,914 --> 01:08:43,413
I demand an explanation.

786
01:08:43,414 --> 01:08:46,455
I think you killed your wife
with the TH-16

787
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:51,456
and stole her body
so there'd be no autopsy.

788
01:08:51,498 --> 01:08:54,372
On what do you base
this fabrication?

789
01:08:54,373 --> 01:08:57,205
Your behaviour,
the vial hidden in your pocket...

790
01:08:57,206 --> 01:09:00,622
- It's not mine.
- They make it in your lab.

791
01:09:00,623 --> 01:09:03,080
It can cause cardiac arrest.

792
01:09:03,081 --> 01:09:04,330
You're a chemist,

793
01:09:04,331 --> 01:09:07,330
your wife died of cardiac arrest.
Do you think I'm an idiot?

794
01:09:07,331 --> 01:09:09,538
Do you think I'm an idiot?

795
01:09:09,539 --> 01:09:11,538
I didn't poison my wife.

796
01:09:11,539 --> 01:09:15,163
If I did, I wouldn't come here
with a vial of the toxin.

797
01:09:15,164 --> 01:09:18,038
It's absurd to poison someone
with TH-16,

798
01:09:18,039 --> 01:09:19,955
then steal the body.

799
01:09:19,956 --> 01:09:22,413
It's undetectable
in a routine autopsy.

800
01:09:22,414 --> 01:09:25,622
It wasn't your specialty before,
now you're an expert.

801
01:09:25,623 --> 01:09:27,413
I was nervous before.

802
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:31,122
If you want a confession
to close the case, forget it.

803
01:09:31,123 --> 01:09:33,622
You've got nothing on me.

804
01:09:33,623 --> 01:09:37,080
I just need to show that something
went wrong so you took the body!

805
01:09:37,081 --> 01:09:40,913
You need to find Mayka,
and I can't help you with that.

806
01:09:40,914 --> 01:09:45,914
I've no idea where she is.

807
01:09:49,623 --> 01:09:51,830
How did you meet your wife?

808
01:09:51,831 --> 01:09:55,747
- What does that matter?
- Curiosity. Too many differences.

809
01:09:55,748 --> 01:09:57,997
- Differences?
- In age...

810
01:09:57,998 --> 01:10:02,998
...status, everything.

811
01:10:03,664 --> 01:10:06,455
Answer me.

812
01:10:06,456 --> 01:10:09,538
It was in Avalon,

813
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:12,247
on Santa Catalina Island,
near L.A.

814
01:10:12,248 --> 01:10:15,372
I spent some days there
after my first year in the university.

815
01:10:15,373 --> 01:10:16,955
You taught Chemistry.

816
01:10:16,956 --> 01:10:20,663
Yes. I didn't like it.
I took a trip to think it over.

817
01:10:20,664 --> 01:10:25,163
One morning, going up
a mountain, a tyre blew out.

818
01:10:25,164 --> 01:10:27,955
Mayka was the only person
I saw in three hours.

819
01:10:27,956 --> 01:10:30,247
She gave me water, her mobile...

820
01:10:30,248 --> 01:10:32,247
and I changed the tyre.

821
01:10:32,248 --> 01:10:36,205
- Lost on an island...
- We were at the same hotel.

822
01:10:36,206 --> 01:10:38,997
She'd just lost her parents
and felt lost, like I did.

823
01:10:38,998 --> 01:10:43,747
Lost but a millionaire.
She'd just inherited a fortune.

824
01:10:43,748 --> 01:10:47,372
- We fell in love.
- How nice, like in the movies.

825
01:10:47,373 --> 01:10:52,080
It's what happened.
I was lucky.

826
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:54,372
Luck's something you have...

827
01:10:54,373 --> 01:10:56,163
or you seek it out.

828
01:10:56,164 --> 01:10:59,830
What do you think?

829
01:10:59,831 --> 01:11:04,831
What the hell
do you want from me?

830
01:11:11,164 --> 01:11:14,580
Let's go back to when
you found your wife's body.

831
01:11:14,581 --> 01:11:17,330
I told the police
who came to my house.

832
01:11:17,331 --> 01:11:22,331
I want you to tell me.

833
01:11:23,289 --> 01:11:28,289
I came home and Mayka
was lying on the sofa, dead.

834
01:11:28,539 --> 01:11:30,997
I thought she was asleep,

835
01:11:30,998 --> 01:11:33,955
but it was strange
that she had her shoes on.

836
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:37,747
I took her pulse, called an ambulance,
and they called the police.

837
01:11:37,748 --> 01:11:40,538
- And the last time you saw her alive?
- That morning.

838
01:11:40,539 --> 01:11:44,122
Three weeks apart.
She arrives and you leave.

839
01:11:44,123 --> 01:11:47,163
What are you insinuating?
I loved my wife.

840
01:11:47,164 --> 01:11:52,164
<i>- You loved her?
- I loved her to the last moment.</i>

841
01:11:52,248 --> 01:11:57,248
Don't you still love someone
after they're dead?

842
01:12:01,081 --> 01:12:06,081
Your calm at her unexpected death
surprises me, it's unnerving.

843
01:12:06,498 --> 01:12:10,330
I'm a scientist,
I know we're not machines.

844
01:12:10,331 --> 01:12:13,080
I heard the forensic person:
a fear of flying can...

845
01:12:13,081 --> 01:12:16,663
A handy theory for you, eh?
I'm sure you already knew.

846
01:12:16,664 --> 01:12:21,664
I had a heart scare two years ago,
with no previous signs.

847
01:12:21,914 --> 01:12:24,497
These things come without warning.

848
01:12:24,498 --> 01:12:29,498
What did you do after
your wife's body was taken away?

849
01:12:30,414 --> 01:12:32,997
I made some calls, I cried...

850
01:12:32,998 --> 01:12:36,247
Gloria, Luna and my sister came over,
we reminisced about Mayka.

851
01:12:36,248 --> 01:12:37,747
And later?

852
01:12:37,748 --> 01:12:41,580
Gloria, Luna
and your sister went home.

853
01:12:41,581 --> 01:12:44,663
- What did you do then?
- Nothing.

854
01:12:44,664 --> 01:12:47,455
We sent a patrol car for you.
You weren't at home.

855
01:12:47,456 --> 01:12:49,705
I went out for painkillers.
I told you.

856
01:12:49,706 --> 01:12:52,663
- Painkillers...
- Yes. I had a headache.

857
01:12:52,664 --> 01:12:55,913
You came straight here
after our call.

858
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:57,372
Exactly.

859
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:02,373
So you have the painkillers.
Show them to me.

860
01:13:06,748 --> 01:13:07,997
This is absurd.

861
01:13:07,998 --> 01:13:12,998
Convince me.

862
01:13:14,664 --> 01:13:17,247
Now you're ringing true.

863
01:13:17,248 --> 01:13:22,248
And as a reward, I'll give you
proof of my theory.

864
01:13:23,873 --> 01:13:28,873
Proof you say I don't have.

865
01:13:31,414 --> 01:13:35,205
Your wife hired a detective
three months ago.

866
01:13:35,206 --> 01:13:38,288
He's been following you, Mr. Ulloa.

867
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:40,622
We have the invoice.

868
01:13:40,623 --> 01:13:45,623
And also your marriage contract.

869
01:13:47,331 --> 01:13:50,997
I think your wife suspected you
of cheating on her.

870
01:13:50,998 --> 01:13:52,163
If so,

871
01:13:52,164 --> 01:13:56,913
you would've violated
one of the main clauses,

872
01:13:56,914 --> 01:14:01,913
and you'd lose all rights
if your wife divorced you.

873
01:14:01,914 --> 01:14:06,914
The question is:
Did the detective catch you?

874
01:14:07,623 --> 01:14:10,913
I think you know
the answer to that,

875
01:14:10,914 --> 01:14:14,372
and you killed her before
she cut you off with nothing.

876
01:14:14,373 --> 01:14:16,455
We'll soon know for sure.

877
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:21,456
A patrol car is heading for
the home of Javier Alonso.

878
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:25,330
Javier Alonso?

879
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:30,331
Your wife's detective.

880
01:14:32,873 --> 01:14:37,873
Anything true you'd like to add?

881
01:14:44,664 --> 01:14:49,664
Look at the name.

882
01:14:52,414 --> 01:14:57,414
Diego Aguilar.

883
01:15:00,873 --> 01:15:05,873
What are you doing?

884
01:15:32,873 --> 01:15:34,122
Go ahead, Pablo.

885
01:15:34,123 --> 01:15:37,163
We're in Alonso's office
and there's no trace of him

886
01:15:37,164 --> 01:15:40,288
or any of the cases
he was investigating.

887
01:15:40,289 --> 01:15:42,872
<i>Someone's taken his hard disk.</i>

888
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:45,080
Register of last calls?
Messages?

889
01:15:45,081 --> 01:15:46,705
There's nothing here, Jaime.

890
01:15:46,706 --> 01:15:48,205
Go to Ulloa's house.

891
01:15:48,206 --> 01:15:52,413
<i>- I'll call the judge for a warrant.
- Okay.</i>

892
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:56,997
Where's the transfer car?

893
01:15:56,998 --> 01:15:59,205
Norma here. Do you read me?

894
01:15:59,206 --> 01:16:00,538
I read you. Go ahead.

895
01:16:00,539 --> 01:16:03,288
<i>Central said you were coming.
What's the delay?</i>

896
01:16:03,289 --> 01:16:06,163
The road's cut off.

897
01:16:06,164 --> 01:16:09,247
The storm tore down some power lines.

898
01:16:09,248 --> 01:16:14,248
They don't know how long
it'll take to shift them.

899
01:16:27,498 --> 01:16:28,997
Any news?

900
01:16:28,998 --> 01:16:33,998
Yeah, babe. I'm knackered.
Want me to get you a coffee?

901
01:17:13,248 --> 01:17:16,247
<i>- Alex, is that you?
- Javier Alonso is a detective.</i>

902
01:17:16,248 --> 01:17:17,788
I know.

903
01:17:17,789 --> 01:17:20,413
- You found him?
- Not exactly.

904
01:17:20,414 --> 01:17:25,414
Someone put an envelope under my door
while I was at the hospital.

905
01:17:27,081 --> 01:17:29,288
There was a pendrive in it.

906
01:17:29,289 --> 01:17:32,247
- Is it from Javier Alonso?
- No sender.

907
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:37,248
It has a file in his name.
I'm sending you the photos.

908
01:17:46,123 --> 01:17:50,205
<i>Alex?</i>

909
01:17:50,206 --> 01:17:51,497
<i>Alex!</i>

910
01:17:51,498 --> 01:17:52,872
Yes...

911
01:17:52,873 --> 01:17:56,830
That's not all.
They put a mike on you. Listen.

912
01:17:56,831 --> 01:17:58,830
<i>I've got everything.</i>

913
01:17:58,831 --> 01:18:01,622
<i>Mayka's going to L.A. soon.
It'll be when she comes back.</i>

914
01:18:01,623 --> 01:18:06,623
<i>She hates flying.
It'll explain the heart attack.</i>

915
01:18:06,873 --> 01:18:09,455
Mayka knew everything.

916
01:18:09,456 --> 01:18:12,122
She sent it.
She'll be coming for you.

917
01:18:12,123 --> 01:18:14,372
<i>- You have to leave! Now!
- I am.</i>

918
01:18:14,373 --> 01:18:15,705
<i>We'll be together soon.</i>

919
01:18:15,706 --> 01:18:18,247
You've been saying that all night
and you're still there.

920
01:18:18,248 --> 01:18:20,872
<i>The main thing now
is to get you safe.</i>

921
01:18:20,873 --> 01:18:23,913
- And you?
- I'm fine.

922
01:18:23,914 --> 01:18:26,955
How can you be fine?
Alex, they won't let you go!

923
01:18:26,956 --> 01:18:28,955
Of course they will.

924
01:18:28,956 --> 01:18:33,205
- They'll make you confess!
- Listen to me, listen.

925
01:18:33,206 --> 01:18:36,163
If Mayka's still alive,
they can't accuse us of anything.

926
01:18:36,164 --> 01:18:38,663
She knows it and wants us
to pay in her own way.

927
01:18:38,664 --> 01:18:40,330
<i>She can do what she wants.</i>

928
01:18:40,331 --> 01:18:42,830
<i>She's certified as dead,
she's free of any blame.</i>

929
01:18:42,831 --> 01:18:45,372
<i>But I promise, nothing bad
will happen to you, okay?</i>

930
01:18:45,373 --> 01:18:47,913
I can't take this anymore.

931
01:18:47,914 --> 01:18:51,455
You and I should never have met.

932
01:18:51,456 --> 01:18:52,955
Carla, I love you.

933
01:18:52,956 --> 01:18:57,956
<i>- And I love you, but...
- Then trust me, please.</i>

934
01:18:58,789 --> 01:19:00,955
What was that?

935
01:19:00,956 --> 01:19:03,247
The lift is stuck.

936
01:19:03,248 --> 01:19:04,913
<i>Are you trapped?</i>

937
01:19:04,914 --> 01:19:07,038
<i>Fuck. It's stuck!</i>

938
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:09,455
Push the alarm.

939
01:19:09,456 --> 01:19:11,538
What's happening now?

940
01:19:11,539 --> 01:19:13,955
It's moving.

941
01:19:13,956 --> 01:19:16,580
<i>But are you alright?</i>

942
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:18,663
I don't know.

943
01:19:18,664 --> 01:19:23,664
I get the feeling someone's here,
that I'm not alone.

944
01:19:27,789 --> 01:19:30,080
<i>Carla, are you alright?</i>

945
01:19:30,081 --> 01:19:32,747
<i>Do anything to get out of there
and join me.</i>

946
01:19:32,748 --> 01:19:34,247
I promise.

947
01:19:34,248 --> 01:19:36,663
<i>We'll soon be together.
it'll all be fine.</i>

948
01:19:36,664 --> 01:19:39,747
<i>Don't abandon me.
- Don't worry. Where will I find you?</i>

949
01:19:39,748 --> 01:19:43,538
<i>- In the car.
- Good, go for a drive.</i>

950
01:19:43,539 --> 01:19:47,663
<i>Don't stop, that'll be safest.</i>

951
01:19:47,664 --> 01:19:55,372
Carla?

952
01:19:55,373 --> 01:20:00,373
Carla!

953
01:20:06,123 --> 01:20:11,123
What's he doing?

954
01:20:19,373 --> 01:20:21,372
- Where the hell are you going?
- I've got to go.

955
01:20:21,373 --> 01:20:23,663
I give the orders here
and you're in my custody.

956
01:20:23,664 --> 01:20:25,330
Someone needs my help.

957
01:20:25,331 --> 01:20:26,788
- Your help?
- Yes.

958
01:20:26,789 --> 01:20:28,497
Who?

959
01:20:28,498 --> 01:20:32,205
Who the hell do you think you are?
You think you can hold me?

960
01:20:32,206 --> 01:20:36,038
You've got no fucking idea
of what I'm capable of!

961
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:41,039
Piss off!

962
01:20:46,623 --> 01:20:49,205
Alright.

963
01:20:49,206 --> 01:20:54,206
Yes, that's the address.

964
01:20:55,248 --> 01:20:59,622
Call me if there's any news.

965
01:20:59,623 --> 01:21:03,663
A patrol car is heading for
the address you gave us.

966
01:21:03,664 --> 01:21:07,788
Now tell me everything again,

967
01:21:07,789 --> 01:21:12,789
from the beginning.

968
01:21:21,248 --> 01:21:24,538
Her name's Carla, Carla Miller.

969
01:21:24,539 --> 01:21:25,955
<i>I met her 8 months ago.</i>

970
01:21:25,956 --> 01:21:28,080
Class B, transposition...

971
01:21:28,081 --> 01:21:30,622
<i>I was giving a talk
at the university.</i>

972
01:21:30,623 --> 01:21:33,705
<i>I'd been arguing with Mayka
and I couldn't concentrate.</i>

973
01:21:33,706 --> 01:21:37,455
<i>I kept losing the thread.
I was about to stop the class</i>

974
01:21:37,456 --> 01:21:41,747
<i>when she arrived,
twenty minutes late.</i>

975
01:21:41,748 --> 01:21:44,205
Excuse me.

976
01:21:44,206 --> 01:21:49,206
Come in, come in.

977
01:21:51,623 --> 01:21:54,372
In this process,

978
01:21:54,373 --> 01:21:56,413
the proteins

979
01:21:56,414 --> 01:22:00,413
can behave as co-factors...

980
01:22:00,414 --> 01:22:02,663
<i>...in an approximate percentage...</i>

981
01:22:02,664 --> 01:22:05,205
She came up and asked me
if she'd missed anything.

982
01:22:05,206 --> 01:22:08,455
I said yes. I lied to her.

983
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:12,663
<i>She snared me straight away.</i>

984
01:22:12,664 --> 01:22:17,205
<i>She'd started Medicine.
She was struggling with Chemistry.</i>

985
01:22:17,206 --> 01:22:19,622
<i>I offered to help her.</i>

986
01:22:19,623 --> 01:22:22,663
<i>It was all very easy.
It seemed natural to me.</i>

987
01:22:22,664 --> 01:22:26,497
<i>At first we worked,
but the classes became an excuse</i>

988
01:22:26,498 --> 01:22:30,538
<i>and we began seeing each other
every day.</i>

989
01:22:30,539 --> 01:22:34,205
<i>I wanted to be honest,
and told her I was married.</i>

990
01:22:34,206 --> 01:22:39,206
<i>She had a boyfriend,
so it was all fine.</i>

991
01:22:39,498 --> 01:22:40,830
What are you doing here?

992
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:45,247
It was a harmless game.
We didn't do anything, just talked.

993
01:22:45,248 --> 01:22:48,288
But we spent so much time together

994
01:22:48,289 --> 01:22:49,747
<i>that Mayka began to suspect.</i>

995
01:22:49,748 --> 01:22:52,080
I expected you earlier.

996
01:22:52,081 --> 01:22:53,913
<i>I tried to stop seeing her.</i>

997
01:22:53,914 --> 01:22:57,413
<i>But it was impossible,
all I could think of was her.</i>

998
01:22:57,414 --> 01:23:02,414
<i>In the end,
the inevitable happened.</i>

999
01:23:51,248 --> 01:23:54,580
With Carla I felt alive again.

1000
01:23:54,581 --> 01:23:58,622
That night,
I told her my life story,

1001
01:23:58,623 --> 01:24:00,872
<i>things I'd never told anyone.</i>

1002
01:24:00,873 --> 01:24:04,330
<i>Neither of us wanted secrets.</i>

1003
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:06,997
<i>But there was my wife...</i>

1004
01:24:06,998 --> 01:24:09,205
<i>She said she didn't want
to deceive anyone.</i>

1005
01:24:09,206 --> 01:24:12,955
<i>I didn't want to deceive my wife,
but I was in love with Carla.</i>

1006
01:24:12,956 --> 01:24:15,955
<i>She left her boyfriend for me.</i>

1007
01:24:15,956 --> 01:24:19,705
<i>But I wasn't ready
to tell Mayka the truth.</i>

1008
01:24:19,706 --> 01:24:21,622
<i>And Carla got tired of waiting.</i>

1009
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:23,747
<i>She refused to see me anymore.</i>

1010
01:24:23,748 --> 01:24:25,997
And she vanished from the map.

1011
01:24:25,998 --> 01:24:27,663
I went crazy.

1012
01:24:27,664 --> 01:24:30,622
I couldn't live without her.
I had to do something.

1013
01:24:30,623 --> 01:24:33,205
<i>There was no going back.
I was in love.</i>

1014
01:24:33,206 --> 01:24:36,330
<i>And I decided. I went to see her.</i>

1015
01:24:36,331 --> 01:24:41,331
<i>I told her it was over with Mayka,
I'd leave her to be with her.</i>

1016
01:24:41,706 --> 01:24:45,788
I love you.

1017
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:47,997
But it wasn't that easy.

1018
01:24:47,998 --> 01:24:50,538
<i>Mayka was stalking me,
watching me.</i>

1019
01:24:50,539 --> 01:24:54,705
<i>I knew a divorce would mean war,
and she'd win.</i>

1020
01:24:54,706 --> 01:24:56,788
<i>She'd destroy me.
She'd leave me with nothing.</i>

1021
01:24:56,789 --> 01:24:59,622
<i>She'd make me start from nothing
to show she was still in control.</i>

1022
01:24:59,623 --> 01:25:02,247
You say you want to be with me,
but you don't want a divorce.

1023
01:25:02,248 --> 01:25:05,038
I don't want to be with you
while you're with her.

1024
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:06,997
I can't take any more.

1025
01:25:06,998 --> 01:25:11,998
This is over,
I can't take any more.

1026
01:25:23,289 --> 01:25:27,163
I can stop being with her
without getting a divorce.

1027
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:29,997
We can have it all.

1028
01:25:29,998 --> 01:25:33,372
She could have an accident.

1029
01:25:33,373 --> 01:25:36,830
I need to know if Carla's alright.

1030
01:25:36,831 --> 01:25:40,163
There's something I don't get.

1031
01:25:40,164 --> 01:25:43,747
If you carefully planned
your wife's death,

1032
01:25:43,748 --> 01:25:46,955
sure of the toxin's infallibility,

1033
01:25:46,956 --> 01:25:50,372
why would she be alive?

1034
01:25:50,373 --> 01:25:51,372
I saw you.

1035
01:25:51,373 --> 01:25:53,663
<i>Your wife hired a detective
three months ago.</i>

1036
01:25:53,664 --> 01:25:55,413
<i>There are a lot of things
you don't know about me.</i>

1037
01:25:55,414 --> 01:25:57,080
<i>Mayka's going to L.A. soon.</i>

1038
01:25:57,081 --> 01:25:59,580
<i>Her fear of flying
can explain a heart attack.</i>

1039
01:25:59,581 --> 01:26:02,830
<i>Someone put an envelope under
my door while I was at the hospital.</i>

1040
01:26:02,831 --> 01:26:04,288
<i>Mayka knew everything.</i>

1041
01:26:04,289 --> 01:26:09,289
How did she avoid dying?
You saw her drink the wine.

1042
01:26:11,623 --> 01:26:16,623
<i>She could've switched glasses.</i>

1043
01:26:19,206 --> 01:26:23,038
<i>If she did,
what do you think happened next?</i>

1044
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:27,997
She could've taken a neuroleptic
to enter a state of catalepsy.

1045
01:26:27,998 --> 01:26:31,122
Some can be diluted in the blood,

1046
01:26:31,123 --> 01:26:35,080
slow down the lungs
and virtually stop the heart.

1047
01:26:35,081 --> 01:26:38,538
Once the agent metabolizes
in the organism,

1048
01:26:38,539 --> 01:26:40,455
the body returns to normal.

1049
01:26:40,456 --> 01:26:43,080
A little twisted. And dangerous.

1050
01:26:43,081 --> 01:26:47,122
Not for Mayka.

1051
01:26:47,123 --> 01:26:49,705
She likes to play.

1052
01:26:49,706 --> 01:26:53,288
And she hates to lose.

1053
01:26:53,289 --> 01:26:56,538
Listen, I've told you everything.

1054
01:26:56,539 --> 01:27:01,539
Please, ask after Carla.

1055
01:27:03,039 --> 01:27:07,122
Jaime.

1056
01:27:07,123 --> 01:27:08,997
I'll be right back.

1057
01:27:08,998 --> 01:27:13,998
- Who is it?
- Pablo, from Ulloa's house.

1058
01:27:14,539 --> 01:27:15,497
Go ahead.

1059
01:27:15,498 --> 01:27:18,497
We found plans of the morgue.
There's a route mapped out

1060
01:27:18,498 --> 01:27:22,413
and instructions on how to
manipulate the security system.

1061
01:27:22,414 --> 01:27:24,413
We're taking all the papers.

1062
01:27:24,414 --> 01:27:27,122
<i>- He knew the building backwards.
- Any trace of the body?</i>

1063
01:27:27,123 --> 01:27:28,205
No, but we found

1064
01:27:28,206 --> 01:27:30,955
<i>a shovel and a sports bag
in the boot of Ulloa's car.</i>

1065
01:27:30,956 --> 01:27:33,288
<i>In it were a balaclava
and some trainers</i>

1066
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:37,538
<i>that match the footprints
on the morgue's emergency stairs.</i>

1067
01:27:37,539 --> 01:27:38,538
<i>Anything else?</i>

1068
01:27:38,539 --> 01:27:42,413
<i>We also found
a '32 hidden in a box.</i>

1069
01:27:42,414 --> 01:27:46,747
<i>It's unregistered
and has been fired recently.</i>

1070
01:27:46,748 --> 01:27:49,663
What the hell's going on?

1071
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:53,372
I've got another call.

1072
01:27:53,373 --> 01:27:54,455
What is it?

1073
01:27:54,456 --> 01:27:56,580
Angel Torres is awake.

1074
01:27:56,581 --> 01:28:01,581
<i>- Hold on.
- Okay.</i>

1075
01:28:01,623 --> 01:28:04,038
The guard is conscious.

1076
01:28:04,039 --> 01:28:08,122
I'll pass you to the hospital.
We're heading for the woods.

1077
01:28:08,123 --> 01:28:09,580
<i>- Jaime.
- How is he?</i>

1078
01:28:09,581 --> 01:28:12,163
Disoriented, but I spoke to him.

1079
01:28:12,164 --> 01:28:14,955
- What did he say?
- You're not gonna believe it.

1080
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:19,956
Fire away.

1081
01:29:55,623 --> 01:30:00,623
Hello?

1082
01:30:13,123 --> 01:30:16,997
Yes. This is Angel Torres.
I'm calling from the morgue.

1083
01:30:16,998 --> 01:30:20,247
I think...
I need you to come here.

1084
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:25,248
<i>Yes, I'll wait. Hurry up.</i>

1085
01:30:46,123 --> 01:30:49,080
<i>He ran out of the morgue
like a scared rat</i>

1086
01:30:49,081 --> 01:30:51,747
<i>until he was run over.</i>

1087
01:30:51,748 --> 01:30:55,247
We just found them.
They're from a '32,

1088
01:30:55,248 --> 01:30:56,913
like the gun at your house.

1089
01:30:56,914 --> 01:30:59,538
I don't own a gun.
It was Mayka.

1090
01:30:59,539 --> 01:31:01,705
Your wife's dead, Mr. Ulloa. Dead.

1091
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:05,205
You can't prove it. They haven't
found the body, nor will they.

1092
01:31:05,206 --> 01:31:07,747
- Because you took it!
- I didn't do anything.

1093
01:31:07,748 --> 01:31:10,538
You motherfucker!
You killed her, then took her away.

1094
01:31:10,539 --> 01:31:13,830
Mayka wants you to think that.
Can't you see?

1095
01:31:13,831 --> 01:31:16,705
<i>Mayka's behind it all.
She set it up with someone's help.</i>

1096
01:31:16,706 --> 01:31:21,706
<i>She faked her disappearance
and made sure she'd wake up.</i>

1097
01:31:27,373 --> 01:31:29,622
She's fucking alive!
She's alive!

1098
01:31:29,623 --> 01:31:31,788
No! You took her body!

1099
01:31:31,789 --> 01:31:34,372
<i>The plans to the morgue
were hidden in your house.</i>

1100
01:31:34,373 --> 01:31:35,788
<i>You had it all worked out.</i>

1101
01:31:35,789 --> 01:31:38,372
<i>You distracted the guard
to confuse us.</i>

1102
01:31:38,373 --> 01:31:42,497
<i>You knew he'd confuse us,
but then he got run over,</i>

1103
01:31:42,498 --> 01:31:45,830
so you've been winging it all night,
playing with us!

1104
01:31:45,831 --> 01:31:49,622
What does it matter now?

1105
01:31:49,623 --> 01:31:52,872
It was set up so that
Mayka would be declared dead,

1106
01:31:52,873 --> 01:31:57,873
and I'd confess.

1107
01:31:58,664 --> 01:32:02,663
<i>Nothing that happened tonight
was an accident,</i>

1108
01:32:02,664 --> 01:32:04,497
believe me.

1109
01:32:04,498 --> 01:32:09,498
<i>Mayka has the power and money
to vanish without a trace.</i>

1110
01:32:09,623 --> 01:32:14,623
It's perfect.
She left no loose ends.

1111
01:32:15,956 --> 01:32:19,997
If it's not too late,
Carla will corroborate my story.

1112
01:32:19,998 --> 01:32:23,538
How do you keep justifying
the unjustifiable?

1113
01:32:23,539 --> 01:32:27,913
Don't you get tired?
Aren't you disgusted?

1114
01:32:27,914 --> 01:32:30,747
Please...

1115
01:32:30,748 --> 01:32:34,038
I need you to help Carla.

1116
01:32:34,039 --> 01:32:39,039
Please.

1117
01:33:21,581 --> 01:33:23,330
Any news on Carla Miller?

1118
01:33:23,331 --> 01:33:24,497
There's no one here.

1119
01:33:24,498 --> 01:33:26,122
<i>- Any signs of violence?
- No.</i>

1120
01:33:26,123 --> 01:33:28,747
The suspect claims
the girl was warned.

1121
01:33:28,748 --> 01:33:30,663
Could she have run away?

1122
01:33:30,664 --> 01:33:35,664
If she hasn't,
someone's made it look that way.

1123
01:33:36,623 --> 01:33:41,623
<i>I'll call you if there's any news.</i>

1124
01:33:44,539 --> 01:33:46,538
<i>Tow truck to the coordinates.
Copy that.</i>

1125
01:33:46,539 --> 01:33:48,663
I don't know what we'll find there.

1126
01:33:48,664 --> 01:33:50,872
<i>I'll await instructions
and tell HQ.</i>

1127
01:33:50,873 --> 01:33:53,747
<i>The tow truck will be 15 minutes.
Everything else in order?</i>

1128
01:33:53,748 --> 01:33:58,748
<i>- Yes, but I need the traffic diverted.
- I'll tell them.</i>

1129
01:33:59,539 --> 01:34:04,330
<i>Jaime's here now. When I speak
to him, I'll relay the info.</i>

1130
01:34:04,331 --> 01:34:07,163
We've found a body.

1131
01:34:07,164 --> 01:34:12,164
Tell Norma and Mateos.

1132
01:35:38,789 --> 01:35:43,497
No one lives at the address
you gave us for Carla Miller.

1133
01:35:43,498 --> 01:35:47,163
The flat's been vacant for years.

1134
01:35:47,164 --> 01:35:50,955
And the neighbours can't recall
any Carla Miller.

1135
01:35:50,956 --> 01:35:54,913
We also checked
Sacred Heart Hospital

1136
01:35:54,914 --> 01:35:57,372
and the Faculty of Medicine,

1137
01:35:57,373 --> 01:36:00,997
but the person you describe...

1138
01:36:00,998 --> 01:36:05,998
does not exist.

1139
01:36:07,581 --> 01:36:10,913
Do you know what I think?

1140
01:36:10,914 --> 01:36:12,747
You invented her

1141
01:36:12,748 --> 01:36:15,497
because you're weak and a coward.

1142
01:36:15,498 --> 01:36:17,413
You invented her.

1143
01:36:17,414 --> 01:36:22,414
Carla Miller gave you the courage
to kill your wife and keep her money.

1144
01:36:28,164 --> 01:36:31,372
Get Forensics to take away the body.

1145
01:36:31,373 --> 01:36:34,872
And clear the road when you can,
this looks like a circus.

1146
01:36:34,873 --> 01:36:36,872
Everyone, get out of here. Go!

1147
01:36:36,873 --> 01:36:39,205
You heard. Everyone out.

1148
01:36:39,206 --> 01:36:42,497
Call the judge.
Tell him we found the body

1149
01:36:42,498 --> 01:36:47,498
and we can charge Ulloa
whenever he orders it.

1150
01:36:54,373 --> 01:36:57,580
Get up.

1151
01:36:57,581 --> 01:37:02,581
C'mon, get up. Let's go.

1152
01:37:52,623 --> 01:37:57,623
Where are you going?

1153
01:38:01,789 --> 01:38:04,163
I know.

1154
01:38:04,164 --> 01:38:08,288
It's hard pretending to be
what you're not all the time.

1155
01:38:08,289 --> 01:38:09,705
What's wrong with me?

1156
01:38:09,706 --> 01:38:11,747
We've been at it eight hours straight,

1157
01:38:11,748 --> 01:38:14,372
shut in a goddamn morgue.

1158
01:38:14,373 --> 01:38:16,330
How do you expect to feel?

1159
01:38:16,331 --> 01:38:18,413
I need help. Please.

1160
01:38:18,414 --> 01:38:23,414
Please.

1161
01:38:24,706 --> 01:38:28,122
You know what?

1162
01:38:28,123 --> 01:38:31,872
This reminds me of my wife.

1163
01:38:31,873 --> 01:38:36,873
<i>She died 10 years ago today.</i>

1164
01:38:40,873 --> 01:38:44,913
<i>The official version is that
she had an accident.</i>

1165
01:38:44,914 --> 01:38:49,914
She was murdered.

1166
01:39:06,123 --> 01:39:11,123
<i>My daughter was in the car too.</i>

1167
01:39:13,914 --> 01:39:14,872
Are you okay?

1168
01:39:14,873 --> 01:39:18,538
Yes.

1169
01:39:18,539 --> 01:39:23,539
Ruth?

1170
01:39:27,414 --> 01:39:30,788
<i>A call to Emergencies
would've saved her life.</i>

1171
01:39:30,789 --> 01:39:33,497
But the car that hit us drove off.

1172
01:39:33,498 --> 01:39:37,580
I guess they were high
on some shit, or drunk.

1173
01:39:37,581 --> 01:39:42,581
They left us there like dogs.

1174
01:39:49,248 --> 01:39:54,248
Help! Help!

1175
01:40:08,081 --> 01:40:10,663
<i>She hung on for an hour.</i>

1176
01:40:10,664 --> 01:40:13,372
Ruth, my love...

1177
01:40:13,373 --> 01:40:18,373
<i>But she died a few minutes
before we were found.</i>

1178
01:40:21,956 --> 01:40:25,580
I tried to recall the license plate.

1179
01:40:25,581 --> 01:40:27,913
Nothing.

1180
01:40:27,914 --> 01:40:32,914
Until, years later,
my daughter remembered.

1181
01:40:35,248 --> 01:40:37,247
<i>A hotel...</i>

1182
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:39,497
<i>...in Avalon...</i>

1183
01:40:39,498 --> 01:40:42,913
...on the Island of Santa Catalina.

1184
01:40:42,914 --> 01:40:46,413
It was like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

1185
01:40:46,414 --> 01:40:51,414
<i>But I had all the time in the world,
and I found it.</i>

1186
01:40:57,373 --> 01:40:59,830
Drive.

1187
01:40:59,831 --> 01:41:01,038
There's a little girl.

1188
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:03,955
- Did she see you?
- No.

1189
01:41:03,956 --> 01:41:06,080
Then drive.

1190
01:41:06,081 --> 01:41:11,081
How could you live all these years
knowing you were murderers?

1191
01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:15,538
I want you to see something.

1192
01:41:15,539 --> 01:41:19,455
It'll help you understand.

1193
01:41:19,456 --> 01:41:24,456
My daughter. Her name's Eva.

1194
01:41:24,623 --> 01:41:27,122
<i>I won't be with you
as long as you're with her.</i>

1195
01:41:27,123 --> 01:41:31,663
We could have it all.
She could have an accident.

1196
01:41:31,664 --> 01:41:33,622
Why won't you answer it?

1197
01:41:33,623 --> 01:41:35,038
<i>- Yes'?
- M r. Ulloa?</i>

1198
01:41:35,039 --> 01:41:38,955
This is Jaime Pea.
I'm calling from the morgue.

1199
01:41:38,956 --> 01:41:41,122
<i>Your wife's body has disappeared.</i>

1200
01:41:41,123 --> 01:41:43,080
What do you mean "disappeared"?

1201
01:41:43,081 --> 01:41:45,830
It has to be more personal.

1202
01:41:45,831 --> 01:41:50,747
<i>Someone wishing to harm your wife,
even after she was dead.</i>

1203
01:41:50,748 --> 01:41:51,788
I'm in the car.

1204
01:41:51,789 --> 01:41:55,455
<i>I went out for a smoke.
The guard's still unconscious.</i>

1205
01:41:55,456 --> 01:41:59,205
<i>We found a shovel and a sports bag
in the boot of Ulloa's car.</i>

1206
01:41:59,206 --> 01:42:02,247
<i>In it are a balaclava
and some trainers</i>

1207
01:42:02,248 --> 01:42:07,248
<i>that match the footprints
on the morgue's emergency stairs.</i>

1208
01:42:07,873 --> 01:42:12,873
<i>You were ready to believe it all.</i>

1209
01:42:13,789 --> 01:42:16,455
Especially Carla.

1210
01:42:16,456 --> 01:42:19,080
I just came out of the restaurant.

1211
01:42:19,081 --> 01:42:22,080
<i>I left the mobile in the bathroom.
No one saw me.</i>

1212
01:42:22,081 --> 01:42:24,497
- What was that?
- The lift is stuck.

1213
01:42:24,498 --> 01:42:29,498
<i>We'll soon be together.</i>

1214
01:42:30,039 --> 01:42:32,705
<i>Carla?</i>

1215
01:42:32,706 --> 01:42:36,080
Carla!

1216
01:42:36,081 --> 01:42:38,622
Eva got to you
without my knowledge.

1217
01:42:38,623 --> 01:42:41,080
<i>She feared the car she recalled</i>

1218
01:42:41,081 --> 01:42:43,372
<i>didn't belong
to her mother's killers,</i>

1219
01:42:43,373 --> 01:42:45,997
<i>that you and your wife
were innocent.</i>

1220
01:42:45,998 --> 01:42:48,205
I knew it was you.

1221
01:42:48,206 --> 01:42:51,330
<i>But she didn't,
and she wanted to be sure.</i>

1222
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:56,331
<i>The only way to verify your guilt
was to make you talk.</i>

1223
01:42:56,539 --> 01:42:59,038
She did it.

1224
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:04,039
<i>You confessed
your darkest secret to her.</i>

1225
01:43:04,248 --> 01:43:07,205
<i>Eva knew I was ready to act.</i>

1226
01:43:07,206 --> 01:43:11,705
She knew if she told me
you'd confessed to your crime,

1227
01:43:11,706 --> 01:43:16,455
I'd have a green light
to go after you and your wife.

1228
01:43:16,456 --> 01:43:17,913
<i>And she did it.</i>

1229
01:43:17,914 --> 01:43:19,872
We have to do it, honey.

1230
01:43:19,873 --> 01:43:21,830
<i>She told me everything.</i>

1231
01:43:21,831 --> 01:43:26,413
Since then you've just been
a puppet in our hands.

1232
01:43:26,414 --> 01:43:28,497
I know what you're thinking.

1233
01:43:28,498 --> 01:43:33,498
Ten years leaves
a lot of time for thinking.

1234
01:43:37,123 --> 01:43:40,163
The detective...

1235
01:43:40,164 --> 01:43:42,163
...was a bargain.

1236
01:43:42,164 --> 01:43:45,538
<i>I just had to put
the invoice in the dossier.</i>

1237
01:43:45,539 --> 01:43:47,830
<i>Eva and I took care of the rest.</i>

1238
01:43:47,831 --> 01:43:50,497
They also put a mike on you.
Listen.

1239
01:43:50,498 --> 01:43:52,913
<i>I've got everything.
Mayka's going to L.A. soon.</i>

1240
01:43:52,914 --> 01:43:55,788
<i>It'll be when she comes back.
She hates flying.</i>

1241
01:43:55,789 --> 01:43:59,247
<i>It'll explain the heart attack.</i>

1242
01:43:59,248 --> 01:44:01,580
<i>Mayka knew everything.</i>

1243
01:44:01,581 --> 01:44:03,413
I'm at the airport.

1244
01:44:03,414 --> 01:44:06,580
There's now no trace of me
you-know-where.

1245
01:44:06,581 --> 01:44:08,622
Nobody saw me get here.

1246
01:44:08,623 --> 01:44:10,913
<i>I'm going back to Berlin.</i>

1247
01:44:10,914 --> 01:44:13,788
<i>Javier Alonso
is conveniently on a trip.</i>

1248
01:44:13,789 --> 01:44:15,997
<i>And of course,
he didn't find out anything.</i>

1249
01:44:15,998 --> 01:44:19,580
The only thing on record
is that Mayka hired him.

1250
01:44:19,581 --> 01:44:23,372
I have your wife's body
and your confession.

1251
01:44:23,373 --> 01:44:27,080
Nothing alters the consequences
of our actions.

1252
01:44:27,081 --> 01:44:32,081
Sooner or later,
someone calls in the debt.

1253
01:44:43,873 --> 01:44:47,288
You'll soon be joining her.

1254
01:44:47,289 --> 01:44:49,247
<i>- What's TH-16?
- A toxin.</i>

1255
01:44:49,248 --> 01:44:50,247
<i>What kind?</i>

1256
01:44:50,248 --> 01:44:52,372
<i>It's extracted
from certain reptiles.</i>

1257
01:44:52,373 --> 01:44:53,747
Why won't you answer it?

1258
01:44:53,748 --> 01:44:54,788
Hello?

1259
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:57,038
<i>Mr. Ulloa, this is
Inspector Jaime Pea.</i>

1260
01:44:57,039 --> 01:44:59,497
<i>I'm calling from the morgue.</i>

1261
01:44:59,498 --> 01:45:02,788
<i>- Your wife's body has disappeared.
- What do you mean "disappeared"?</i>

1262
01:45:02,789 --> 01:45:06,163
Nothing tonight
has happened by accident.

1263
01:45:06,164 --> 01:45:09,413
- Who was it?
- The police.

1264
01:45:09,414 --> 01:45:11,663
<i>I had a heart scare two years ago,</i>

1265
01:45:11,664 --> 01:45:12,705
and I was fine.

1266
01:45:12,706 --> 01:45:16,830
We've been at it 8 hours straight,
shut in a goddamn morgue.

1267
01:45:16,831 --> 01:45:18,247
<i>How do you expect to feel?</i>

1268
01:45:18,248 --> 01:45:19,663
<i>Diluted in blood,</i>

1269
01:45:19,664 --> 01:45:24,664
<i>it causes a cardiac 8 hours
after ingestion and leaves no trace.</i>

1270
01:45:45,289 --> 01:45:50,289
Tick-tock.
