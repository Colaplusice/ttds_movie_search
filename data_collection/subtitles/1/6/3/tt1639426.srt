1
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:55,520
Not so fast

2
00:01:57,731 --> 00:01:58,789
Come on

3
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,014
Climb Fatso, climb.

4
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:27,423
Don't fall on us or we'll die.

5
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:28,952
l'm slipping

6
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:30,758
Put your foot here.

7
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:32,423
Now go.

8
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:35,628
Go on you cow...

9
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:41,440
Careful

10
00:02:57,123 --> 00:02:58,454
Easy...

11
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:03,523
Fatso, you eat too much.

12
00:03:03,597 --> 00:03:05,531
l got tired giving him a leg up.

13
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,464
You're no less...

14
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:09,729
Did you see yourself?

15
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:12,067
At least l did it on my own.

16
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:13,799
He almost crushed us.

17
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:17,674
Did you see his legs
dangling in mid air?

18
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:19,002
l'm hungry...

19
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,014
Forget it fatso. We're already late.

20
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:29,019
Thanks to this idiot,
l've started pronouncing it

21
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:30,556
'Filum' instead of film.

22
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:31,818
Walk on the side.

23
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:33,018
Four tickets please...

24
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:34,892
Quickly, give me your money.

25
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:38,095
Here...
- Twenty...

26
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:39,756
My twenty...

27
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,494
You?
- Don't have any...

28
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:43,502
You're so cheap...

29
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,896
Why are you always like this?

30
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:46,495
Keeps eating, that's why...

31
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:47,631
Lets go, quick...

32
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:49,504
Hurry hurry...

33
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:52,501
lt's just started.

34
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:01,713
Look at those...

35
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:07,050
Here Fatso.

36
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:17,065
This is a grape...

37
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:19,528
A very ripe grape...

38
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,534
Her name is 'Desire'

39
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:24,537
And she desires...

40
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:30,273
A young and handsome man...

41
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,608
Look at that...

42
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:34,153
Who will love her...

43
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:37,819
And enjoy the juice of this grape.

44
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:00,977
What a beauty...

45
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,574
Look behind...
- Why?

46
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:06,710
There's another movie going on.

47
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:13,582
Where's your wife?

48
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,718
Uncle!

49
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:22,192
Excuse me.

50
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:23,727
Yes?

51
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:25,798
You are very beautiful...

52
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:27,134
Oh Shit!
- What?

53
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:30,005
lt's Mr. Rathod. The Moustache.

54
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:33,603
Run! lt's the Moustache.

55
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,614
Bengali get up.

56
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,617
Look who it is...

57
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:41,945
Stop!

58
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:43,614
Run Fatso! Run fast.

59
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,148
Stop!

60
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:46,624
Come on, fast!

61
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:47,819
Stop! Benoy...

62
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:50,886
Benoy... Rohan...

63
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,897
What was Moustache doing there?

64
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:57,630
Watching the movie, what else?

65
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,035
Did he recognize us?

66
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:00,629
He was calling you
by your name, idiot!

67
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:02,038
Benoy... Benoy...

68
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:03,700
Oh shit! He has a moped.

69
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:05,642
Should've punctured the tyres.

70
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:07,043
Why didn't you think of that before?

71
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:08,637
What if he complains?

72
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:12,043
lf we reach school before
him he can't do anything.

73
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:14,245
Run. Come on, run Manu...

74
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,844
This time we're dead.

75
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:18,049
Don't think too much...

76
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:22,790
What happened?
- Lets see...

77
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:24,321
Don't...

78
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:26,665
He twisted his ankle.

79
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,325
And no one here to
straighten it out.

80
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:29,732
Shut up Bengali.

81
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:33,204
You guys carry on.
l'll get back on my own.

82
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:35,002
How? Will you fly?

83
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:36,736
Moustache will get you expelled.

84
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,005
And he'll throw you a parade?

85
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:41,870
Come on, lift him up.

86
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:45,742
Walk slowly...

87
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,285
Slowly...

88
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,817
Gently...

89
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:04,227
Oh Shit!

90
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:06,363
Run

91
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,701
Come on. Hurry!

92
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:09,698
Benoy... do something...

93
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:11,767
Fatso lift his leg...

94
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:13,710
Hurry, you fat cow.

95
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,714
Run run run

96
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:25,850
See you at school!

97
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:32,789
He's gone...

98
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:02,352
What did you do, Junior?

99
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:04,293
Didn't finish my tasks.

100
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:05,822
That's it?

101
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:07,025
They sent you to Heady for that?

102
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,096
And what did you do?

103
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:11,429
Went to town for a film last night.

104
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:12,829
Then?

105
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:14,767
He broke his leg.

106
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:15,899
So?

107
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:17,374
Our luck ran out...

108
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:18,835
Now?

109
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:20,303
Don't know...

110
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:23,774
You got caught?

111
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:26,379
No. We're here to kiss Heady.

112
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:29,312
What will your father do?

113
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:33,058
Break whatever bones l have left.

114
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:36,118
My father will send me to
my grandmother in Singur...

115
00:08:36,196 --> 00:08:37,788
to study in a government school...

116
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:39,126
if it still exists...

117
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:42,067
My father will be reading the news...

118
00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:44,069
He'll ask, ''You're home?''

119
00:08:44,404 --> 00:08:46,338
l'll say, ''Yes, it's vacation time''.

120
00:08:46,406 --> 00:08:47,805
He'll ask, ''When do you go back?''

121
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:48,932
l'll say, ''When they phone.''

122
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:50,333
So?

123
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,877
We don't have a phone at home.

124
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:55,205
And you?

125
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:57,407
Rohan...

126
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:00,809
The boy is asking what
your father will do.

127
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,418
No idea...

128
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:10,892
l haven't seen him for eight years.

129
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:12,355
Why?

130
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:39,316
What was the name?

131
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:41,384
Whose name sir?

132
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:45,255
Name of the film.

133
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,928
Rohan?

134
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:53,930
Sir?

135
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,467
Kanti Shah's ''Grapes.''

136
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:03,940
Last year you left
all the taps running...

137
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:07,282
We had to evacuate the whole hostel.

138
00:10:07,353 --> 00:10:09,878
No sir, that was two years ago...

139
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:11,947
Last year it was the fans...

140
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:14,417
Sorry sir.

141
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:16,894
l just spoke to your father Muninder.

142
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:18,021
We got a phone at home?

143
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:19,223
Shut up!

144
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:23,299
What did my father say?

145
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:24,893
He's coming to get you himself.

146
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:27,498
He's going to kill me sir.

147
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:30,167
Please... one last chance...

148
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:32,108
Stand straight.

149
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:33,303
Yes

150
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,507
This is the third
time you've been caught.

151
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:41,177
Your parents have been informed.

152
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:42,915
They're waiting for you at home.

153
00:10:43,523 --> 00:10:45,252
You are expelled.

154
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:47,316
No Sir please Sir.

155
00:10:47,393 --> 00:10:48,917
Dismissed. All of you.

156
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:56,459
Rohan...

157
00:10:58,471 --> 00:10:59,529
l'm sorry.

158
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:09,139
Excuse me sir?

159
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:10,944
Please ask Mr.
Rathod who the lady was?

160
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:13,952
The one whose blouse
he had his hand in?

161
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,478
Please sir.

162
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:21,484
Where's Rohan?

163
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:23,486
There he is...

164
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:06,529
Scared?

165
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:12,603
We had to leave sometime...

166
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:15,211
Couldn't stay in school forever...

167
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:27,350
Want to hear a poem?

168
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:29,752
Sure...

169
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,028
Tiny scattered moments,

170
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:38,036
Sprinkled on the garden of memories.

171
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:41,233
Strolling, bare foot, on them,

172
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:43,171
lt feels we've wandered too far...

173
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:46,307
Now we can't remember,
where we left our shoes.

174
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:50,445
Our heels were soft when we got here,

175
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:53,313
They still feel tender.

176
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,111
And they will remain fragile,

177
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:58,447
Till those bittersweet memories,

178
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:01,049
Keep tingling them.

179
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:05,455
True, we've forgotten,

180
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:07,055
Where we left our shoes...

181
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:12,537
But now it seems, we
don't need them anymore.

182
00:13:28,554 --> 00:13:29,612
Liked it?

183
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:37,153
Did you understand it?

184
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:04,446
We should've watched
the whole film...

185
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,183
Come to Bombay.

186
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,728
l'll show you
Paris Hilton's sex tape.

187
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:25,670
l'll miss you guys...

188
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:27,212
We too, pal.

189
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:29,214
Okay, then..

190
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:33,218
Take care..

191
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:36,346
You look after yourself.

192
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:37,548
You too

193
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:44,288
Take care, man.

194
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:11,520
Take him home carefully, Moustache.

195
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:20,597
Does your wife know about the woman
whose blouse you had your hand in?

196
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:22,725
ldiot...

197
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:25,595
What?

198
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:26,929
Go.

199
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:37,209
The beauty has vanished

200
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:46,624
Like smoke into thin air.

201
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:57,230
Then, we were lost in our dreams,

202
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:07,769
Now we face the unknown.

203
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:21,918
ls life over?.

204
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:27,796
Or is it about to begin?

205
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:31,532
ls this nightfall?

206
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:37,668
Or is it a new dawn?

207
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:40,473
ls life over?.

208
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,285
Or is it about to begin?

209
00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:51,289
ls this nightfall?

210
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:55,817
Or is it a new dawn?

211
00:16:56,295 --> 00:17:02,894
Will the future bring comfort?

212
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:14,303
Or will bring us to a crossroad?

213
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:23,915
Who knows what lies ahead ...

214
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:10,631
Has come on platform no. 2.

215
00:21:39,111 --> 00:21:40,635
That's my bed.

216
00:21:56,061 --> 00:21:57,119
Who is he?

217
00:21:58,063 --> 00:21:59,121
Your brother.

218
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:00,665
My brother?

219
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:03,796
After your mother died..

220
00:22:04,803 --> 00:22:06,202
l got married again.

221
00:22:07,072 --> 00:22:08,334
lt didn't work out...

222
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:09,665
Move ..

223
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:30,627
Get up.

224
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:31,754
This is my bed.

225
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,630
Get up or l'll whack you so hard
you'll go to the bathroom and cry.

226
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:37,026
Get up!

227
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:00,850
Come here.

228
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:06,654
This is my cupboard.

229
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:11,669
Listen pipsqueak. This cupboard
was mine before you were born...

230
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:16,674
Now that l'm back, this cupboard,
this table, this bed...

231
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:18,676
Everything is mine.
Nothing is yours.

232
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:20,872
What is your name?

233
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:22,004
Arjun

234
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:18,328
Go and get him.

235
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,148
Sir is calling you.

236
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,417
Sir?

237
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,091
You call Papa 'Sir'?

238
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,161
Tell 'Sir' that l'm coming.

239
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:08,783
l'm coming.

240
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:10,185
Sir is getting angry.

241
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:35,802
Next time you'll have no hair left.

242
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:51,220
Little brother...

243
00:25:51,296 --> 00:25:52,354
Big Brother...

244
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:53,898
Coming. Coming.

245
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,094
You're slow...

246
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,837
Good evening Uncle.

247
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:00,963
Here...

248
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:02,364
Here also...

249
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:06,843
And who is this?

250
00:26:07,846 --> 00:26:09,370
As big as your uncle...

251
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:10,506
Hello.

252
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:13,244
His voice broke...

253
00:26:14,052 --> 00:26:15,110
Good evening Auntie.

254
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:16,245
Good evening.

255
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:17,913
He is so handsome!

256
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,389
Handsome my ass

257
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:21,391
Good evening to Auntie,

258
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,257
And only a 'hello' for me?

259
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:24,852
Well done...

260
00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:27,459
Where is my hug?

261
00:26:30,402 --> 00:26:31,994
Good to see you.

262
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,128
Listen...

263
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:35,867
Heard you were a bad boy at school...

264
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:38,267
Who was she?

265
00:26:38,343 --> 00:26:39,401
Nobody.

266
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:41,878
l went to see a film with friends.

267
00:26:41,947 --> 00:26:43,141
At Rivoli?
- Yes.

268
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:45,080
We used to see lots of films there.

269
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,544
Good one?

270
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:48,882
Don't know. We had to run back.
- Why

271
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:50,880
Our warden was there.

272
00:26:50,956 --> 00:26:52,014
Who?

273
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,148
Rathod.

274
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:54,487
Big moustache.
- Yes.

275
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,220
Who made him a warden?

276
00:26:56,295 --> 00:26:57,956
He used to be a peon.

277
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,895
Not him... His son.

278
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:01,899
He has a moustache too?

279
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:03,025
Yes.

280
00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:04,966
Come in. Our moustache is watching.

281
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:06,499
So big man

282
00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:08,497
What now?

283
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:09,904
College
- College!

284
00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:12,103
Everyone goes to college.

285
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:13,972
What will you study?

286
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:16,173
Arts, Literature.

287
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:17,442
Why not science?

288
00:27:17,516 --> 00:27:18,983
l want to be a writer.

289
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:20,109
Wow!

290
00:27:20,185 --> 00:27:21,311
What will you write?

291
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:25,049
Poems, novels, stories, or jokes?

292
00:27:25,123 --> 00:27:26,181
Everything

293
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:27,316
Nothing.

294
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:31,921
He'll write nothing

295
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:36,130
He will study engineering
and work in my factory.

296
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:41,535
He wants to study literature.

297
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:43,335
What's wrong with that?

298
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:47,469
Writers are respected these days.

299
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:49,207
Respect won't feed him...

300
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:51,939
Writers only grow
their hair like girls,

301
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:53,951
wear a kurta, carry a bag...

302
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:55,953
And think they're brilliant.

303
00:27:56,488 --> 00:27:58,012
But they're not.

304
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:01,949
Then they die. Either from hunger.

305
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:04,226
Or as frustrated alcoholics.

306
00:28:05,364 --> 00:28:11,166
lf he lives in my house
he has to obey my rules.

307
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:13,301
l don't want to work in a factory.

308
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:14,430
Did l ask for your opinion?

309
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:17,100
Did anyone?

310
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:20,970
What are you staring at?

311
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,978
l'll whack you so hard your
eyes will fall in your plate.

312
00:28:25,517 --> 00:28:27,246
Lower your eyes and eat your food.

313
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:40,389
See how cheeky he is Jimmy?

314
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:43,392
What would our father have done,

315
00:28:43,468 --> 00:28:44,992
lf we had behaved like this.

316
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:48,596
He would've melted our bones
along with steel in the furnace.

317
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:53,141
And if we'd been kicked out
of the best school in lndia...

318
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:55,069
Do you know what he would have done?

319
00:28:55,414 --> 00:29:02,013
We'd be out on the streets
till we proved our worth.

320
00:29:02,487 --> 00:29:04,352
lf you don't behave yourself

321
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:06,084
l'll treat you the same way.

322
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:11,289
At least your father would've
met you once in eight years...

323
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,224
No, no...

324
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,358
He's just a child...

325
00:29:16,435 --> 00:29:18,096
Child? He's insolent.

326
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,228
Let me go...

327
00:29:19,304 --> 00:29:20,362
Hardly has a moustache..

328
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:23,033
And talks back to his father.

329
00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:25,042
l'm talking to you...

330
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:29,104
How dare you...

331
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:31,046
Stop, Stop ... You'll kill him.

332
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:34,108
Let him go...

333
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:44,594
Enough.

334
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:12,488
Why do you talk to him like that?

335
00:30:12,557 --> 00:30:15,082
He doesn't understand any other way.

336
00:30:17,496 --> 00:30:19,157
He brought you into this world.

337
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:20,289
Mummy did that...

338
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:22,293
He is your father.

339
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:24,162
What kind of a father is he?

340
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:27,366
He abandoned me for eight years...

341
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:33,373
One letter a year which
sounded like the news on TV.

342
00:30:33,645 --> 00:30:37,103
''Everything is fine here.
l got your results...

343
00:30:37,182 --> 00:30:38,376
''... you could do better.''

344
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:41,385
l had even forgotten his face...

345
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,317
Saw him at the station
and wondered who he was...

346
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:50,117
l'm his son, not a
fixed deposit in a bank.

347
00:30:53,465 --> 00:30:56,525
l'll clean toilets all my life
but l won't work for him.

348
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,801
Come on, get up.

349
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:18,551
Every father wants his son to
grow up to be just like himself.

350
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,220
Give him a chance.

351
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:24,355
He might understand.

352
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:30,491
l know that you'll do
whatever it is you want...

353
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:34,364
But first stand on your feet.

354
00:31:35,507 --> 00:31:40,171
Then be whatever you want to
be; Write or clean toilets.

355
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:44,573
Come...

356
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:46,913
The food's getting cold...

357
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,182
Come. For my sake...

358
00:31:52,924 --> 00:31:55,518
You can't deny a fat man his food...

359
00:31:55,594 --> 00:31:58,461
l'm starving.

360
00:32:18,683 --> 00:32:20,207
Bring Arjun upstairs.

361
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:36,227
Arjun get up.

362
00:32:38,236 --> 00:32:39,362
Arjun get up.

363
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:54,245
Let's get some facts straight...

364
00:32:55,587 --> 00:32:56,645
This is my house...

365
00:32:58,256 --> 00:33:01,248
lf you stay here, you will
have to live by my rules.

366
00:33:02,327 --> 00:33:03,385
First rule-

367
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,663
Call me Sir as Arjun does.

368
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:13,662
What did you call
your seniors at school?

369
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,269
Sir

370
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:21,608
What happened at Jimmy's
should never happen again.

371
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:24,342
You will never...

372
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:28,285
Ever misbehave with me again...

373
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:31,278
You will not raise your voice...

374
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:35,286
And you will only do as l say.

375
00:33:36,361 --> 00:33:37,419
Understood?

376
00:33:38,963 --> 00:33:40,362
Okay

377
00:33:40,432 --> 00:33:41,490
The word is 'Yes'

378
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:45,360
Yes

379

Yes what?

380
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:51,700
Yes Sir

381
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:58,305
Give up your dreams of
being a writer.

382
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,580
lt will not happen.

383
00:34:01,986 --> 00:34:03,647
Stop flying.

384
00:34:04,656 --> 00:34:05,714
Keep your feet on the ground.

385
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:08,717
Do you understand me?

386
00:34:09,728 --> 00:34:10,786
Yes Sir.

387
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:12,921
You will come to the
factory with me from tomorrow.

388
00:34:13,732 --> 00:34:17,463
You'll work there till lunch
then leave for engineering college.

389
00:34:18,737 --> 00:34:21,331
Thanks to your school record...

390
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,537
l've had to beg a
lot of favours for you.

391
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:28,339
lf you let me down again...

392
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:31,613
l'll slit your throat.

393
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:34,476
Do you understand?

394
00:34:50,568 --> 00:34:51,899
Did Sir shout at you?

395
00:34:55,373 --> 00:34:56,897
He always shouts at me.

396
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,768
Or beats me.

397
00:35:18,863 --> 00:35:20,262
Be down in five minutes.

398
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:21,656
Arjun.

399
00:35:33,878 --> 00:35:36,278
l'll show you the sights
of Jamshedpur while we jog.

400
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:40,880
When we return, we will
race from there to here.

401
00:35:41,285 --> 00:35:42,877
But l don't want to race.

402
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:44,811
Has anyone asked you?

403
00:35:45,623 --> 00:35:46,681
Lets go.

404
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:57,759
And you?

405
00:35:57,969 --> 00:35:59,698
l can't run.

406
00:36:00,304 --> 00:36:01,362
Why?

407
00:36:42,947 --> 00:36:44,744
Chotu.

408
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:48,350

St. George's Church

425
00:38:23,447 --> 00:38:24,505
Come on.

426
00:38:44,468 --> 00:38:45,526
Timing?

427
00:38:45,603 --> 00:38:47,002
Forty one minutes.

428
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:48,997
Good.

429
00:38:52,476 --> 00:38:53,602
Disgraceful!

430
00:39:05,156 --> 00:39:07,021
Disgraceful!

431
00:40:11,555 --> 00:40:12,613
Listen

432
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:15,016
Study well

433
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:18,151
l shouldn't get any complaints.

434
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:19,287
Okay Sir.

435
00:40:57,201 --> 00:40:58,793
This is my son Rohan.

436
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,867
He's been at Bishop Cotton School.

437
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:06,202
He will be joining us from today...

438
00:41:07,878 --> 00:41:13,874
Let's hope he'll
work as hard as we do.

439
00:41:15,152 --> 00:41:17,017
And be a good co-worker.

440
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,625
He is my son, but at home.
Not here.

441
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,621
lf anyone has a complaint
about him...

442
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:30,831
Please feel free to voice it.

443
00:41:31,635 --> 00:41:32,693
Understood?

444
00:41:33,237 --> 00:41:34,898
Now get to your work.

445
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:36,637
Come Mr. Rao.

446
00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:38,032
You too

447
00:41:38,909 --> 00:41:40,638
Mr. Rao is the manager here.

448
00:41:41,645 --> 00:41:43,237
He will brief you about your work.

449
00:41:44,648 --> 00:41:45,774
He is older than you.

450
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,178
Shall we?

451
00:41:50,988 --> 00:41:52,046
Just a moment...

452
00:41:58,129 --> 00:41:59,187
Best of luck.

453
00:43:13,737 --> 00:43:15,932
An engineer always faces the task

454
00:43:16,006 --> 00:43:19,339
Of describing shapes
of objects on paper.

455
00:43:19,743 --> 00:43:23,076
The paper, through which an
engineer conveys the details

456
00:43:23,147 --> 00:43:27,948
Of a machine or object is
called Engineering Drawing.

457
00:43:28,285 --> 00:43:32,415
ln order to present the exact
size and shape of the object,

458
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:35,891
The lines are drawn perpendicular
to the planes of the paper

459
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,761
From various angles of the object,
giving an image on the paper.

460
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:44,028
These are called
Orthographic projections.

461
00:43:44,368 --> 00:43:46,768
ln the figure 10.1

462
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:51,297
All three sides,
that is front, side, top...

463
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:52,967
Can be seen together.

464
00:43:53,377 --> 00:43:56,312
When the projections are
parallel to one another...

465
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,178
And also perpendicular
to the picture plane,

466
00:43:59,383 --> 00:44:04,377
The projection thus forming a plane
is called Orthographic Projection.

467
00:44:04,788 --> 00:44:08,315
When a surface, front, side or top...

468
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:11,317
Of the object is to
be depicted separately

469
00:44:11,395 --> 00:44:14,125
lt is drawn in the
true shape and proportion.

470
00:44:14,465 --> 00:44:18,401
By assuming the object
placed in a particular position,

471
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:22,200
Where only the surface
to be drawn is visible.

472
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,807
The projection is the representation
of the shape of an object.

473
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:28,868
On a plane or surface...

474
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:38,212
Don't you know that
style is taxed in college?

475
00:44:38,422 --> 00:44:40,083
Now you know...

476
00:44:41,025 --> 00:44:42,219
Will you cut your hair now?

477
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,827
What shall we do with him?

478
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:45,953
Sit ups.

479
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,827
Fifty sit
- ups.

480
00:44:48,098 --> 00:44:50,362
Go down. All the way.

481
00:44:50,434 --> 00:44:51,492
Stand.

482
00:44:52,169 --> 00:44:53,898
Who's counting? My father?

483
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:55,370
He asked you to sit, not shit.

484
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:56,897
What are you laughing at?

485
00:45:25,202 --> 00:45:27,397
You can't escape me now!

486
00:45:27,471 --> 00:45:29,200
l'm big, l'm small,

487
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:31,867
l'm stronger, l have a gun.

488
00:45:31,942 --> 00:45:33,933
How will you kill me?

489
00:46:18,255 --> 00:46:19,654
Put it on my account.

490
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,259
Come on. Lay out the food.

491
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:55,183
Why don't we keep a cook?

492
00:46:56,493 --> 00:46:57,551
Will you pay?

493
00:47:00,564 --> 00:47:02,555
And a maid for Arjun...

494
00:47:02,633 --> 00:47:03,691
Yes, you can keep one.

495
00:47:04,568 --> 00:47:06,035
When you earn, you can keep one.

496
00:47:07,304 --> 00:47:10,034
Maid, cook, whatever...

497
00:47:12,476 --> 00:47:13,704
There's a recession on,

498
00:47:14,511 --> 00:47:16,604
Do you understand what that means?

499
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:20,583
Go. Call Arjun.

500
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:27,384
Sir is calling you for dinner.

501
00:48:45,335 --> 00:48:46,393
He's coming.

502
00:50:41,718 --> 00:50:42,776
Yes!

503
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:28,889
Rum and coke.

504
00:51:47,317 --> 00:51:48,716
l remember, l had chased him..

505
00:51:57,327 --> 00:51:58,385
Do you know my name?

506
00:51:59,596 --> 00:52:00,654
No

507
00:52:01,465 --> 00:52:02,523
Mishter Apu.

508
00:52:03,734 --> 00:52:04,792
Mister Apu.

509
00:52:04,868 --> 00:52:05,926
Mishter

510
00:52:06,336 --> 00:52:07,394
Mister...

511
00:52:07,471 --> 00:52:11,339
Mishter..
- Mishter. - Appu. - Appu.

512
00:52:12,275 --> 00:52:14,004
We are your seniors,
you know that don't you?

513
00:52:15,846 --> 00:52:16,904
Yes.

514
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:22,441
Then you also know that a
senior can do anything he likes.

515
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:25,679
What shall we do with him?

516
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:27,681
Sing a song?

517
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:29,350
What the fuck fatso!

518
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,419
You always make people sing.

519
00:52:33,296 --> 00:52:34,729
He makes everyone sing.

520
00:52:35,766 --> 00:52:37,358
You want to make it to lndian ldol?

521
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:38,625
Why do you keep asking me?

522
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:39,760
Ask him. He never says anything.

523
00:52:39,836 --> 00:52:40,962
Okay. You.
What shall we do with him?

524
00:52:42,572 --> 00:52:44,631

You're sitting so quietly,

No man, you sang well...

Why are you getting angry?

549
00:53:44,634 --> 00:53:46,499

Don't listen to fatso. He's mad.

555
00:53:55,045 --> 00:53:57,570
Will you like it if l made

How can l live off him?
He wears shorts.

lf you let him,
he'll eat days of the year

603
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:59,802
He'll eat the food of
a starving man.

604
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:03,002
And the last wishes of a dying man.

605

He'll eat Laloo's children

606
00:56:05,742 --> 00:56:07,573

He'll eat the fun of youth

608
00:56:09,579 --> 00:56:11,046

00:56:11,781 --> 00:56:14,716
He'll eat the walk of
a woman with no shame.

610
00:56:15,118 --> 00:56:16,585
And if given a chance...

611
00:56:17,587 --> 00:56:18,713
He'll eat all your thoughts as well.

612
00:56:21,992 --> 00:56:25,519
Even a tortoise is faster,
Fatso master...

613
00:56:25,595 --> 00:56:29,053
He is a gas
- blaster, fatso master...

614
00:56:29,132 --> 00:56:32,533
Fatso master is a total disaster...

615
00:56:32,602 --> 00:56:35,662
Total Disaster is Fatso master.

616
00:56:35,872 --> 00:56:39,171
Speaks from his ass, fatso master.

617
00:56:39,242 --> 00:56:42,211
Drinks only Fosters, Fatso master.

618
00:56:42,279 --> 00:56:45,908
Equals a hundred elephants,
Fatso master.

619
00:56:46,082 --> 00:56:49,540
Stomach or Equator? Fatso master.

620
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:53,077
Larger than extra large,
Fatso master.

621

Original loo breaker,
Fatso master.

The Titanic's anchor,
Fatso master.

623
00:57:30,794 --> 00:57:31,920
Disgraceful.

car during the holidays.

641

No! Go to sleep.

653
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:42,028
Lower your voice.

l had so many plans for you...

657
01:03:34,456 --> 01:03:37,948
To send you to England
to become a engineer...

658
01:03:39,027 --> 01:03:41,495
But you've ruined everything.

659
01:03:43,498 --> 01:03:45,523
Which college will take you?

660
01:03:47,369 --> 01:03:49,599
Will any college take you?

661
01:03:50,172 --> 01:03:55,576
Will they?
- No!

662
01:03:57,112 --> 01:03:58,477
Can't even take a little pain eh?

663
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:00,105
Not even this much?

664
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:02,708
ldiot.

665
01:04:05,587 --> 01:04:07,282
You're not a boy. You're a girl.

666
01:04:08,657 --> 01:04:15,722
You look like a girl too.

667
01:04:18,667 --> 01:04:20,464
Just like your mother.

668
01:04:24,106 --> 01:04:26,301
She loved you very much.

669
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:30,637
More than me...

670
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,338
Understood?

671
01:04:38,687 --> 01:04:39,745
Get lost.

672
01:04:48,029 --> 01:04:50,088
l came to see you at school...

673
01:04:52,634 --> 01:04:55,102
Met your principal too.

674
01:04:56,238 --> 01:04:58,706
You were playing football...

675
01:05:01,176 --> 01:05:03,542
You looked so happy,
l didn't want to disturb you...

676
01:05:06,581 --> 01:05:07,775
And besides...

677
01:05:08,717 --> 01:05:11,777
l had nothing nice to say.

678
01:05:14,055 --> 01:05:15,750
ldiot girl!

679
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:18,217
Haven't even had sex...

680
01:05:21,129 --> 01:05:22,187
Leave me alone!

681
01:05:24,399 --> 01:05:25,661
l'm okay now.

682
01:05:27,402 --> 01:05:28,460
Girl!

683
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:45,377
What?

684
01:05:46,087 --> 01:05:47,816
He was the original drunkard.

685
01:05:49,558 --> 01:05:52,356
Drunk all day long.

686
01:05:53,762 --> 01:05:54,820
The first thing
he did every morning.

687
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:59,589
Eat booze. Drink booze. Piss booze.

688
01:06:00,769 --> 01:06:04,102
Sold my mother's
wedding necklace for a drink

689
01:06:04,773 --> 01:06:07,833
He'd curse and beat
her when she protested.

690
01:06:09,244 --> 01:06:11,337
My sister and l could only watch.

691
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:15,706
One day l came home and
he was beating her again.

692
01:06:16,718 --> 01:06:18,117
My mother isn't a
bag of dirty laundry.

693
01:06:19,688 --> 01:06:20,848
l got pissed off...

694
01:06:21,456 --> 01:06:23,390
l became a hero and
caught him by the collar.

695
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:26,859
'' Enough of your drama!'' l shouted.

696
01:06:27,862 --> 01:06:30,797
And threw him out of the house.

697
01:06:31,466 --> 01:06:33,593
Told him never to look back.

698
01:06:34,803 --> 01:06:39,206
Then l slammed the door shut
and turned towards my mother.

699
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:42,203
Thought she would embrace me.

700
01:06:43,211 --> 01:06:44,610
But got a tight slap instead.

701
01:06:47,716 --> 01:06:52,312
Then she led that moron back in...

702
01:06:55,223 --> 01:06:59,751
And said, '' Whatever happens, he
is my husband and you're his son.''

703
01:07:03,431 --> 01:07:06,594
l became an orphan that day.

704
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:09,428
Left home...

705
01:07:11,506 --> 01:07:12,905
But didn't leave Jamshedpur.

706
01:07:12,974 --> 01:07:14,236
My biggest mistake.

707
01:07:25,687 --> 01:07:28,679
Fatso, before all this
heartache kills me, let's fight...

708
01:07:28,757 --> 01:07:30,782
No man.
- Come on fatso.

No, Apu. Apu sit. Apu, don't go.

711
01:07:34,329 --> 01:07:37,765
Apu wait.
- Apu.

712
01:07:38,533 --> 01:07:40,933
Apu.. - l've been

713
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:42,928
Who the hell is this?

714
01:07:43,338 --> 01:07:46,466
This isn't carrom son. Go play Ludo.

715
01:07:47,709 --> 01:07:48,767
What's he doing?

716
01:07:49,277 --> 01:07:52,940
Don't ask.

717
01:07:53,281 --> 01:07:54,339
This isn't carrom son.

718
01:07:54,549 --> 01:07:56,744
Really? ls it that funny?

719
01:07:56,885 --> 01:07:57,943
Shall l make you cry instead?

720
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:00,344
What did you say? Make me cry?

721
01:08:00,422 --> 01:08:01,821
Yes. l'll make you cry.

722
01:08:02,691 --> 01:08:03,749
Where do you stay?

723
01:08:03,825 --> 01:08:05,292
Wait, wait...
- What did you say?

724
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,418

725
01:08:06,761 --> 01:08:07,819
You'll make me cry?
- Yes.

726
01:08:07,896 --> 01:08:09,261
Do you know who l am?
- Who are you?

727
01:08:09,331 --> 01:08:11,231
Don't you recognize me?
- Who are you?

728
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:13,233
Don't you recognize me?
- Who are you?

729
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:16,566
Are you new here?
- Are you?

730
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:18,299
Why are you wasting your
time with this mad man?

731
01:08:18,373 --> 01:08:19,533
See how he's talking to me!

732
01:08:19,607 --> 01:08:20,665
Who are you?

01:08:20,742 --> 01:08:21,970

Let's get out.

746
01:09:30,845 --> 01:09:31,903
Come on Shiv...

747
01:09:44,392 --> 01:09:45,654
Run Fatso

748
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:53,860
Open the door. Quick.

749
01:09:57,672 --> 01:09:59,003
Open the door.

750
01:10:00,408 --> 01:10:02,467
Quick. Open, open, open...

751
01:10:11,686 --> 01:10:15,554
Get lost! Blow me
you fuckers! Get lost!

752
01:10:27,435 --> 01:10:28,493
What did you tell him?

753
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:30,938
l said, '' Look son...

754
01:10:31,506 --> 01:10:33,838
Play pool with me
instead of with these fools.

755
01:10:34,442 --> 01:10:37,104
l can pot the ball without a stick.''

756
01:10:39,547 --> 01:10:40,605
You're lying.

757
01:10:40,682 --> 01:10:41,740
No l swear.

758
01:10:41,816 --> 01:10:43,044
Then he told me to get lost...

759
01:10:43,651 --> 01:10:47,451
So l said, ''This is why
you're here putting balls in...

760
01:10:47,522 --> 01:10:49,956
And your wife does the
same at home with other men.''

761
01:10:51,493 --> 01:10:53,984
You never said that...
- He's lying...

762
01:10:54,062 --> 01:10:55,427
l really did say it

763
01:10:55,897 --> 01:10:59,128
Then he kept staring at me.
So l said, ''What are you looking at?

764
01:10:59,467 --> 01:11:03,870
Want to see your wife's tattoo?
lt's across both cheeks of my ass.''

765
01:11:05,073 --> 01:11:06,131
You said that?

766
01:11:06,207 --> 01:11:09,472
Balls you said that. Fuck off.

767
01:11:10,011 --> 01:11:11,069
l really did!

768
01:11:11,946 --> 01:11:13,413
But it was fun...

769
01:11:14,749 --> 01:11:18,947
Fatso doesn't believe me, eh?

770
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:22,615
Apu Don't. Stop it.

771
01:11:26,094 --> 01:11:27,425
Hey it's raining.
- Rain!

772
01:11:27,495 --> 01:11:32,159
Filled with the joy of life,

773
01:11:34,035 --> 01:11:41,840
Bursting with delight.

774
01:11:42,777 --> 01:11:47,441
We never asked for this moment...

775
01:11:47,515 --> 01:11:49,506
We stole it.

776
01:11:49,984 --> 01:11:53,784
This is how we will live...

777
01:12:34,696 --> 01:12:38,757
lf we had run faster we
wouldn't have been expelled.

778
01:12:39,834 --> 01:12:40,892
Rohan?

779
01:12:40,969 --> 01:12:42,027
No, it's the Moustache.

780
01:12:42,103 --> 01:12:43,661
Look behind you. l'm
standing there with my moped.

781
01:12:44,172 --> 01:12:46,231
Rohan, how are you?

782
01:12:46,841 --> 01:12:47,899
Manu...

783
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:49,968
How are you?

784
01:12:50,044 --> 01:12:52,069
l'm good.
Why are you awake this late?

785
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:53,911
Jamshedpur has a new disco?

786
01:12:53,982 --> 01:12:58,248
No man. l sneaked out to
drink with some friends.

787
01:12:58,586 --> 01:13:00,247
Grown up already?

788
01:13:00,688 --> 01:13:03,179
Oh shut up.
We got into a fight as well.

789
01:13:03,725 --> 01:13:06,592
Beat up two guys. Had a blast.

790
01:13:07,128 --> 01:13:08,186
You're mad...

791
01:13:08,596 --> 01:13:09,688
Totally mad

792
01:13:10,598 --> 01:13:11,656
You okay?

793
01:13:11,733 --> 01:13:12,791
Totally fine.

794
01:13:12,934 --> 01:13:14,595
How's your father?

795
01:13:14,669 --> 01:13:16,830
Not father. Call him 'Sir'.

796
01:13:17,605 --> 01:13:21,166
Makes me work at his
factory and study engineering...

797
01:13:21,242 --> 01:13:23,142
Says l should study.
There's a recession on...

798
01:13:23,611 --> 01:13:24,669
Do you know what recession means?

799
01:13:25,146 --> 01:13:26,773
l don't know what it means.

800
01:13:27,882 --> 01:13:32,615
Even if l fail all my
exams he can't do anything

801
01:13:33,154 --> 01:13:34,212
He can't do shit...

802
01:13:35,123 --> 01:13:38,991
l also have a younger half
- brother.

803
01:13:39,894 --> 01:13:42,692
A six-year-old brother who
l didn't even know existed.

804
01:13:44,232 --> 01:13:45,290
Are you okay?

805
01:13:45,633 --> 01:13:49,160
l'm fine. l really am.
Meet the new town drunk.

806
01:13:50,138 --> 01:13:52,606
Enough about me.
How are Vikram and Benoy?

807
01:13:52,674 --> 01:13:54,232
Everyone is fine...

808
01:13:54,909 --> 01:13:58,310
Vikram's Dad has a new restaurant.
Vikram is working there.

809
01:13:58,913 --> 01:14:02,212
Benoy's in art school.
He's changed completely.

810
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:06,882
Wears a kurta, quotes Tagore,
shows a new girl his room everyday.

811
01:14:07,255 --> 01:14:08,313
Why? ls it a special room?

812
01:14:08,589 --> 01:14:10,079
Yes... it has a bed...

813
01:14:15,263 --> 01:14:16,321
And you?

814
01:14:16,397 --> 01:14:18,194
l'm fine. Looking for work.

815
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,132
Dad still ignores me
and reads his news...

816
01:14:21,669 --> 01:14:26,902
And mom sulks as if dad caught her
watching the Kanti Shah's ''Grapes''.

817
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:30,677
Are you happy?
- l am...

818
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:33,806
And you?
- Me too...

819
01:14:34,282 --> 01:14:35,340
You sure?

820
01:14:36,284 --> 01:14:37,342
l'm sure...

821
01:14:38,686 --> 01:14:40,085
l miss you guys a lot.

822
01:14:40,154 --> 01:14:42,213
Come to Bombay.
Tell your father..

823
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:45,691
..we'll take care of everything.
Even you'll have fun.

824
01:14:46,194 --> 01:14:48,025
l will come. For sure.

825
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:52,231
Listen, l don't have much money,
l'll call you some other time.

826
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:55,635
Tell Vikram and Benoy
that l said hi.

827
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:57,704
l will... and you take care...

828
01:14:57,772 --> 01:14:58,830
l will.

829
01:14:58,906 --> 01:15:00,635
And keep calling...

830
01:15:00,708 --> 01:15:01,936
l will... bye...

831
01:15:14,255 --> 01:15:16,189
Ok. Bye

832
01:16:14,782 --> 01:16:16,443
Bhairav Singh

833
01:16:17,852 --> 01:16:19,342
l am coming to get you...

834
01:16:21,722 --> 01:16:23,781
Do you understand recession?

835
01:16:24,325 --> 01:16:25,792
Disgraceful.

836
01:16:56,290 --> 01:16:57,484
Was this picnic your idea?

837
01:16:58,826 --> 01:17:01,351
Your father isn't as bad
as you make him out to be.

838
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:06,064
l just don't get him.
Sometimes a demon, sometimes a lamb.

839
01:17:07,835 --> 01:17:10,030
Spoken like a true writer...

840
01:17:11,105 --> 01:17:12,367
l'm not talking like a writer...

841
01:17:13,107 --> 01:17:16,440
Your mother would have been
proud if she were alive today.

842
01:17:16,978 --> 01:17:18,843
She always wanted you
to be a writer.

843
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,374
Really?
- Yes.

844
01:17:21,449 --> 01:17:24,907
She never told your
father but she told me...

845
01:17:25,853 --> 01:17:30,790
How she would've loved that line...
Sometimes a demon, sometimes a lamb.

846
01:17:33,461 --> 01:17:38,125
Sometimes a demon,
sometimes a lamb.

847
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:40,861
Stop it!

848
01:17:50,011 --> 01:17:53,412
l have an idea...

849
01:17:53,481 --> 01:17:55,472
What is it?

850
01:17:57,985 --> 01:17:59,316
Let's hear one of Rohan's poems...

851
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:06,023
He's written a full-length novel...

852
01:18:07,495 --> 01:18:10,555
l'm not asking you to
change your mind ...

853
01:18:11,165 --> 01:18:14,498
Listen to it. lf you
don't like it, don't applaud.

854
01:18:18,039 --> 01:18:20,166
Come on big man, go for it.

855
01:18:24,512 --> 01:18:29,506
lf you could see past the shore,
You would know what l think.

856
01:18:30,451 --> 01:18:35,184
lf you could hear the waves,
You would know what l think.

857
01:18:36,324 --> 01:18:41,125
Remove your veil of obstinacy,
And look beyond the window.

858
01:18:42,063 --> 01:18:46,591
lf you could see through convention,
You would know what l think.

859
01:18:47,868 --> 01:18:52,896
lf you had faith in yourself as l do,
You could walk with me a while...

860
01:18:53,941 --> 01:18:58,435
lf you could see the colors l do,
You could walk with me a while.

861
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,880
lf you want to touch the sky as l do,

862
01:19:01,949 --> 01:19:04,179
Then your desires would come alive.

863
01:19:04,952 --> 01:19:09,616
Then, in my next life, we
could fly together a while.

864
01:19:17,431 --> 01:19:18,489
Forget it

865
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,899
A woman's magazine will publish it...

866
01:19:20,968 --> 01:19:23,266
...or someone will drop a
coin in your begging bowl.

867
01:20:11,886 --> 01:20:12,944
Hello.

868
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:17,048
Please... sit...

869
01:20:17,691 --> 01:20:18,749
Hello

870
01:20:18,826 --> 01:20:19,884
How are you?
- Please, have a seat.

871
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,018
How was the journey?

872
01:20:21,362 --> 01:20:23,330
Okay. Our flight got a bit delayed.

873
01:20:24,899 --> 01:20:26,423
l made these for you to read.

874
01:20:50,391 --> 01:20:55,124
They're good...

875
01:20:56,330 --> 01:20:58,025
l'm glad you came today.

876
01:20:59,066 --> 01:21:00,397
l'm off to Kolkata tomorrow...

877
01:21:00,868 --> 01:21:03,462
Let me show you the workshop.

878
01:21:04,271 --> 01:21:05,329
Sure.

879
01:21:10,878 --> 01:21:11,936
Hello?

880
01:21:12,012 --> 01:21:13,479
ls that Mr. Singh?
- Yes?

881
01:21:13,814 --> 01:21:17,181
l'm Mrs Batra here,
Principal of Arjun's school.

882
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:18,809
Yes Mrs Batra, tell me.

883
01:21:18,886 --> 01:21:22,014
There's been another problem with
your son, Arjun, this morning...

884
01:21:22,823 --> 01:21:25,792
We'd like you to come here
and take him back home today.

885
01:21:27,027 --> 01:21:30,019
l'm in a meeting right now.
Can l come post lunch?

886
01:21:30,297 --> 01:21:33,095
No Mr. Singh. This is an
extremely serious problem.

887
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:34,259
l know Mrs. Batra but...

888
01:21:35,369 --> 01:21:37,132
Keep him in your office for sometime.

889
01:21:37,204 --> 01:21:38,762
Mr. Singh please understand

890
01:21:38,839 --> 01:21:41,103
l cannot allow Arjun to
remain in school today.

891
01:21:42,109 --> 01:21:44,373
Okay, l'm coming.

892
01:21:44,445 --> 01:21:45,503
ln half an hour?

893
01:21:45,579 --> 01:21:46,910
Yes Mrs. Batra. l'm coming right now.

894
01:21:46,981 --> 01:21:48,039
Thank you, Mr. Singh.

895
01:21:51,385 --> 01:21:55,515
l'm sorry, but l have to
rush to my son's school.

896
01:21:55,856 --> 01:21:59,189
He's been unwell
recently and it got worse today.

897
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:03,128
But Mr. Rao will show
you around the workshop.

898
01:22:03,197 --> 01:22:05,859
No problem. We'll come back tomorrow.

899
01:22:05,933 --> 01:22:08,197
We have other factories to see today.

900
01:22:08,335 --> 01:22:12,032
But l told you, l have to be in
Kolkata tomorrow. l've committed it.

901
01:22:12,473 --> 01:22:14,532
l am sorry. We can't stay any longer.

902
01:22:15,409 --> 01:22:18,435
Anyway. We'll meet again.
Some other time?

903
01:22:19,146 --> 01:22:20,204
Okay...

904
01:22:20,414 --> 01:22:21,472
Let's go.

905
01:22:51,912 --> 01:22:52,970
What happened?

906
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:54,238
Get in the car.

907
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:14,458
What happened?

908
01:23:15,869 --> 01:23:17,029
His blood pressure is very low.

909
01:23:17,538 --> 01:23:19,438
Seems like he's had a bad fall.

910
01:23:20,207 --> 01:23:21,504
There could be internal bleeding.

911
01:23:22,343 --> 01:23:25,244
l'll have to check. We'll keep him
under observation for a few days.

912
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,370
How many days?

913
01:23:26,947 --> 01:23:28,005
Four to five days.

914
01:23:28,082 --> 01:23:29,140
Four to five days?

915
01:23:29,216 --> 01:23:32,242
Don't worry. He'll
be fine. Don't worry.

916
01:23:33,153 --> 01:23:34,211
Thank you.

917
01:23:37,891 --> 01:23:38,949
How did it happen?

918
01:23:39,493 --> 01:23:40,551
Fell down the stairs.

919
01:23:41,962 --> 01:23:43,020
How?

920
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:45,955
How should l know? He just fell.

921
01:23:50,237 --> 01:23:51,636
You go home. l'll stay here.

922
01:23:52,973 --> 01:23:54,031
l'm also staying.

923
01:23:58,579 --> 01:23:59,637
What happened to your results?

924
01:24:00,914 --> 01:24:02,643
l passed.
- Marks?

925
01:24:03,984 --> 01:24:06,043
They're good.
- Good.

926
01:24:14,528 --> 01:24:16,120
l'm going to Kolkata for three days.

927
01:24:18,265 --> 01:24:21,166
lf all goes well, l'll
return with a few contracts.

928
01:24:22,269 --> 01:24:24,169
You stay here with Arjun.

929
01:24:24,471 --> 01:24:26,996
And don't leave him alone, okay?

930
01:24:27,074 --> 01:24:28,132
Yes Sir.

931
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,538
And...

932
01:24:35,082 --> 01:24:37,141
No need to inform Uncle and Auntie.

933
01:24:38,285 --> 01:24:41,686
l've told them that both of
you are going with me. Okay?

934
01:24:42,022 --> 01:24:43,080
Yes Sir.

935
01:24:45,426 --> 01:24:46,484
Fine.

936
01:24:56,303 --> 01:24:57,361
Have you eaten?

937
01:25:04,645 --> 01:25:06,044
Sir has gone to kolkata.

938
01:25:08,582 --> 01:25:09,640
Aren't you happy?

939
01:25:18,192 --> 01:25:19,250
What happened yesterday?

940
01:25:48,288 --> 01:25:49,346
For you.

941
01:25:57,030 --> 01:25:58,088
And these...

942
01:25:58,165 --> 01:25:59,757
lf you feel like reading.

943
01:26:08,242 --> 01:26:10,642
This has my poems and stories.

944
01:26:11,311 --> 01:26:12,369
Would you like to hear some?

945
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:17,708
Hello Arjun.

946
01:26:19,453 --> 01:26:20,579
Are you feeling well today?

947
01:26:21,288 --> 01:26:22,346
Good.

948
01:26:28,328 --> 01:26:29,590
Could you change his clothes?

949
01:26:29,663 --> 01:26:31,130
Yes.
- Thank you.

950
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:36,727
What is it?

951
01:27:06,099 --> 01:27:07,157
What now?

952
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:11,153
Lunch was to be served by 12.30.
lts 1 :00 p.m now.

953
01:28:11,231 --> 01:28:13,165
Please don't shout. lt's bad for you.

954
01:28:13,233 --> 01:28:14,461
Yes l know.

955
01:28:14,768 --> 01:28:16,167
l can get a heart attack.

956
01:28:16,236 --> 01:28:18,329
But if l die of hunger before that?

957
01:28:18,405 --> 01:28:20,464
l'll go and get your food just now.

958
01:28:20,908 --> 01:28:22,170
Get it fast...

959
01:28:22,709 --> 01:28:24,904
Corpses don't eat.

960
01:28:29,783 --> 01:28:30,909
Why don't you laugh?

961
01:28:32,386 --> 01:28:33,512
l am 80 years old...

962
01:28:34,521 --> 01:28:35,920
Grandfather of six.

963
01:28:36,423 --> 01:28:37,720
Great grandfather of two...

964
01:28:38,191 --> 01:28:39,249
Can't l shout?

965
01:28:40,193 --> 01:28:41,251
Laugh.

966
01:28:42,195 --> 01:28:43,253
Laugh.

967
01:28:58,645 --> 01:28:59,703
Would you like to listen to a poem?

968
01:29:10,824 --> 01:29:11,882
Chandu's Cycle.

969
01:29:12,759 --> 01:29:15,227
Chandu's cycle was
just like Chandu...

970
01:29:15,829 --> 01:29:18,696
As it moved, it crickered and
crankered, just like Chandu.

971
01:29:19,566 --> 01:29:22,626
The handle was as light
as Chandu's slender hand.

972
01:29:23,236 --> 01:29:26,262
The pedals were as thin
as Chandu's spindle legs.

973
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:30,232
The seat was as broad
as Chandu's huge behind.

974
01:29:30,978 --> 01:29:34,243
The carrier was as small
as Chandu's short career.

975
01:29:34,781 --> 01:29:36,373
Yet it was Chandu's true friend.

976
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:38,283
Was always loyal to Chandu.

977
01:29:39,252 --> 01:29:42,779
lt took Chandu's
heavy weight with ease.

978
01:29:43,357 --> 01:29:46,793
One day the cycle broke down.

979
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:49,251
Seeing a bull charging at him,

980
01:29:49,363 --> 01:29:50,694
Chandu dropped it hard.

981
01:29:51,264 --> 01:29:54,256
When Monty Mechanic
could not save the cycle,

982
01:29:54,935 --> 01:29:58,268
Chandu's father sold
it to a scrap dealer.

983
01:29:58,739 --> 01:30:02,266
Chandu drowned himself in his books.

984
01:30:02,409 --> 01:30:05,378
Like he had an old dream to fulfill.

985
01:30:06,013 --> 01:30:07,412
Later, when Chandu grew up,

986
01:30:07,814 --> 01:30:09,281
He used his very first salary...

987
01:30:09,683 --> 01:30:13,278
And got himself a new cycle...

988
01:30:14,287 --> 01:30:15,345
But...

989
01:30:15,522 --> 01:30:16,580
But?

990
01:30:16,823 --> 01:30:20,281
This cycle too was
just like Chandu...

991
01:30:20,627 --> 01:30:23,289
lt still crickered and
crankered as it moved around.

992
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:25,297
lt's seat was...

993
01:30:25,365 --> 01:30:27,424
As broad as Chandu's huge behind.

994
01:30:27,634 --> 01:30:29,295
The carrier was as small...

995
01:30:29,369 --> 01:30:31,303
As Chandu's short career.

996
01:30:34,307 --> 01:30:35,365
You wrote that?

997
01:30:36,543 --> 01:30:38,306
Yes
- Wow...

998
01:30:38,979 --> 01:30:40,037
Very good.

999
01:30:40,914 --> 01:30:42,313
Very inspiring !

1000
01:30:42,549 --> 01:30:44,983
Thank you.
- Keep writing like this, son.

1001
01:30:45,719 --> 01:30:47,050
Keep writing.

1002
01:30:48,388 --> 01:30:50,982
Write.

1003
01:30:59,933 --> 01:31:02,925
How many friends do
you have in school?

1004
01:31:06,339 --> 01:31:07,397
Seven.

1005
01:31:07,474 --> 01:31:08,532
Their names?

1006
01:31:08,742 --> 01:31:09,800
Apurva,

1007
01:31:10,343 --> 01:31:11,742
Sunny, Raju,

1008
01:31:11,812 --> 01:31:13,336
Batuk, Kunal...

1009
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:15,514
Kunal...Kunal,

1010
01:31:15,582 --> 01:31:16,640
Veer.

1011
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:18,408
And?

1012
01:31:18,618 --> 01:31:19,676
And...

1013
01:31:20,887 --> 01:31:21,945
That's only six.

1014
01:31:24,357 --> 01:31:25,551
And one more...

1015
01:31:26,827 --> 01:31:27,885
Tushar.

1016
01:31:28,361 --> 01:31:29,692
You have so many friends.

1017
01:31:30,363 --> 01:31:31,557
l have only three.

1018
01:31:32,899 --> 01:31:34,423
What was your mother like?

1019
01:31:35,368 --> 01:31:37,734
My mother was very nice.

1020
01:31:38,972 --> 01:31:40,439
She loved me a lot.

1021
01:31:41,374 --> 01:31:42,602
She smelled wonderful

1022
01:31:42,676 --> 01:31:44,371
when l'd cuddle up to sleep.

1023
01:31:45,045 --> 01:31:46,376
Just like a mother.

1024
01:31:48,482 --> 01:31:50,450
l don't know what
my mother was like.

1025
01:31:51,051 --> 01:31:52,382
Do you know her?

1026
01:31:53,987 --> 01:31:55,045
No.

1027
01:32:02,729 --> 01:32:03,787
Mr Poet...

1028
01:32:06,399 --> 01:32:07,627
Why don't you ever laugh?

1029
01:32:09,002 --> 01:32:10,060
Yes.

1030
01:32:10,137 --> 01:32:12,401
Look at you now. You look so good.

1031
01:32:14,007 --> 01:32:15,406
When do we hear something new?

1032
01:32:15,709 --> 01:32:16,767
Tonight?

1033
01:32:16,943 --> 01:32:18,001
ln the night?

1034
01:32:18,745 --> 01:32:20,007
Do you also write at night?

1035
01:32:20,413 --> 01:32:21,471
Sometimes.

1036
01:32:21,548 --> 01:32:22,674
Beware of the night ...

1037
01:32:23,483 --> 01:32:24,541
You see ...

1038
01:32:24,885 --> 01:32:26,409
The day destroys the night,

1039
01:32:26,753 --> 01:32:28,015
Night divides the day.

1040
01:32:28,588 --> 01:32:29,646
Try to run,

1041
01:32:29,956 --> 01:32:31,014
Try to hide...

1042
01:32:31,158 --> 01:32:32,557
Break on through to the other side.

1043
01:32:35,495 --> 01:32:38,430
This is the true
story of three friends...

1044
01:32:38,698 --> 01:32:41,428
Muninder, Benoy and Rohit.

1045
01:32:41,802 --> 01:32:45,431
The kingdom where
they lived would select

1046
01:32:45,505 --> 01:32:47,439
the smartest boys for training.

1047
01:32:47,774 --> 01:32:52,040
Years later, they would join
the King's prestigious army.

1048
01:32:52,712 --> 01:32:56,443
But nobody really knew what
went on inside the castle.

1049
01:32:56,983 --> 01:33:00,441
Their parents didn't know
that the King's evil minister,

1050
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:03,887
Was brain-washing the kids
and turning them into robots.

1051
01:33:04,191 --> 01:33:05,453
ls it a true story?

1052
01:33:05,525 --> 01:33:06,583
Yes.

1053
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:09,458
The wicked man's name was Rathod.

1054
01:33:09,529 --> 01:33:10,587
Rathod!

1055
01:33:10,664 --> 01:33:11,858
Yes, Rathod.

1056
01:34:16,062 --> 01:34:18,155
Vikreet and Benoy were
with the full Robot Army...

1057
01:34:18,531 --> 01:34:20,522
Muninder and the kids
were due any minute now...

1058
01:34:20,834 --> 01:34:23,826
Rohit was worried.
They hadn't come yet.

1059
01:34:24,271 --> 01:34:28,537
He turned around. And froze.
A terrified look came into his eyes.

1060
01:34:29,209 --> 01:34:31,200
He saw someone
coming through the tunnel.

1061
01:34:31,878 --> 01:34:33,675
Someone was coming from the tunnel...

1062
01:34:33,747 --> 01:34:34,873
Who was coming?

1063
01:34:38,785 --> 01:34:40,218
Who was it?

1064
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:48,184
We'll finish tomorrow...
- Now!

1065
01:34:54,901 --> 01:34:56,027
34 in Chemistry

1066
01:34:57,570 --> 01:34:59,697
20 in Physics. 15 in Maths.

1067
01:35:01,041 --> 01:35:02,565
You told me you passed.

1068
01:35:04,177 --> 01:35:08,238
ls this a joke to you?

1069
01:35:09,649 --> 01:35:12,584
l thought you'd finally
become serious about your studies.

1070
01:35:12,652 --> 01:35:17,112
You're narrating
stories to half-dead people.

1071
01:35:17,190 --> 01:35:18,589
Just to hear them tell you
what a good writer you are.

1072
01:35:20,593 --> 01:35:21,651
What are you staring at?

1073
01:35:22,595 --> 01:35:23,653
Lower your eyes.

1074
01:35:24,998 --> 01:35:27,262
lf this wasn't a hospital,
l would skin you right now.

1075
01:35:28,601 --> 01:35:31,593
l'm not going to
forget this in a hurry.

1076
01:35:32,906 --> 01:35:36,842
Come home. l'll make
sure l get an answer.

1077
01:35:44,284 --> 01:35:45,615
What did Sir say?

1078
01:35:45,752 --> 01:35:48,619
Sir said that he will send
me to the hospital as well.

1079
01:35:48,755 --> 01:35:49,813
Why?

1080
01:35:50,690 --> 01:35:51,816
Because l failed my exams.

1081
01:35:53,326 --> 01:35:55,624
So you'll go back to
boarding school?

1082
01:35:56,162 --> 01:35:57,220
No. Why?

1083
01:35:57,297 --> 01:36:01,927
Sir said if l don't pass,
he'll send me to a boarding school.

1084
01:37:19,712 --> 01:37:21,043
What happened that day?

1085
01:37:22,382 --> 01:37:23,713
Sir hit me.

1086
01:37:25,718 --> 01:37:26,776
Why?

1087
01:37:26,853 --> 01:37:31,313
Two boys were teasing me at school.
l broke one's teeth.

1088
01:37:33,726 --> 01:37:34,784
Did he beat you a lot?

1089
01:37:34,861 --> 01:37:36,726
He beat me with a belt.

1090
01:38:32,252 --> 01:38:33,310
Shall we go?

1091
01:38:48,468 --> 01:38:49,799
How old are you?

1092
01:38:57,977 --> 01:38:59,501
l'm asking you something.

1093
01:39:00,413 --> 01:39:01,471
How old are you?

1094
01:39:03,816 --> 01:39:04,874
Seventeen.

1095
01:39:05,818 --> 01:39:06,876
Seventeen...

1096
01:39:08,121 --> 01:39:09,418
And you still don't use your brain.

1097
01:39:10,557 --> 01:39:13,822
When will you start?
After you turn forty?

1098
01:39:19,832 --> 01:39:20,890
Why did you fail?

1099
01:39:22,502 --> 01:39:23,560
l didn't study.

1100
01:39:23,836 --> 01:39:24,894
Why not?

1101
01:39:25,138 --> 01:39:26,901
l don't understand engineering.

1102
01:39:27,373 --> 01:39:29,238
You didn't try hard enough.

1103
01:39:29,842 --> 01:39:30,900
l did.
- Shut up!

1104
01:39:32,478 --> 01:39:33,536
Bloody failure.

1105
01:39:40,353 --> 01:39:42,150
lf you weren't studying,
what were you doing?

1106
01:39:43,856 --> 01:39:44,948
l'd sit by the river.

1107
01:39:46,326 --> 01:39:47,384
What did you do there?

1108
01:39:52,031 --> 01:39:54,591
What did you do there?
Smoke cigarettes?

1109
01:39:57,170 --> 01:39:58,228
Yes

1110
01:40:00,039 --> 01:40:01,097
When did you start smoking?

1111
01:40:01,874 --> 01:40:02,932
ln school.

1112
01:40:04,043 --> 01:40:06,511
So why did you lie earlier?

1113
01:40:21,427 --> 01:40:22,485
Light it.

1114
01:40:26,899 --> 01:40:28,890
l'm not joking. Light it.

1115
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,518
Smoke it....

1116
01:41:46,512 --> 01:41:48,173
What other lies have you told me?

1117
01:41:53,052 --> 01:41:57,512
Lying is a weakness. lt's cowardice.

1118
01:41:59,726 --> 01:42:02,524
A liar is a spineless person.

1119
01:42:04,063 --> 01:42:07,396
Who doesn't have the balls to
say what he really believes.

1120
01:42:09,135 --> 01:42:10,534
You're a coward.

1121
01:42:11,738 --> 01:42:13,467
Do you have the
balls to hear the truth?

1122
01:42:14,207 --> 01:42:15,469
l ask the questions here.

1123
01:42:15,608 --> 01:42:18,543
l said l want to be a writer.
Did you listen?

1124
01:42:18,745 --> 01:42:22,203
You know that l'm a good writer.
Everyone likes my writing...

1125
01:42:22,281 --> 01:42:26,217
l don't. And l will
not discuss it anymore.

1126
01:42:26,619 --> 01:42:29,019
How often have you lied to me?

1127
01:42:29,088 --> 01:42:30,419
Every time you
couldn't digest the truth

1128
01:42:30,490 --> 01:42:32,754
And where is your spine?

1129
01:42:33,025 --> 01:42:36,017
You lied as well. You said
that Arjun fell down the stairs.

1130
01:42:36,295 --> 01:42:37,762
He didn't fall down the stairs.

1131
01:42:38,231 --> 01:42:40,096
l know that you beat
him with your belt.

1132
01:42:40,166 --> 01:42:42,293
l lost a contract
worth a lot because of him.

1133
01:42:42,568 --> 01:42:45,628
He should understand
the consequences.

1134
01:42:45,772 --> 01:42:47,296
By hitting him?
- lt was a mistake.

1135
01:42:47,373 --> 01:42:48,431
By sending him to hospital?

1136
01:42:48,508 --> 01:42:51,773
l didn't want to send him to the
hospital. l said it was a mistake.

1137
01:42:51,844 --> 01:42:54,642
l didn't want to hit him.
l apologized to him.

1138
01:42:54,714 --> 01:42:59,378
Well done Sir. Scar the child
for life, scare him to death...

1139
01:42:59,719 --> 01:43:02,654
and then apologise. Your
father would have been proud.

1140
01:43:05,057 --> 01:43:09,050
l said it happened by mistake,
l didn't want to hit him...

1141
01:43:09,662 --> 01:43:10,720
Did l tell you?

1142
01:43:12,465 --> 01:43:13,523
Sir?

1143
01:43:13,666 --> 01:43:14,724
What?

1144
01:43:15,134 --> 01:43:16,726
Won't you apologise to me now?

1145
01:43:17,069 --> 01:43:18,127
You!

1146
01:44:35,615 --> 01:44:36,673
Good morning.

1147
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:38,808
Good morning, Sir.

1148
01:44:40,887 --> 01:44:42,149
Arjun get up.

1149
01:44:44,156 --> 01:44:45,623
l know you're awake.

1150
01:44:47,226 --> 01:44:48,284
Get up.

1151
01:44:55,167 --> 01:44:57,158
l'm here to apologize...

1152
01:44:58,838 --> 01:44:59,896
Forgive me.

1153
01:45:01,507 --> 01:45:04,169
There's too much work and
then there's the two of you.

1154
01:45:05,845 --> 01:45:07,244
l get frustrated.

1155
01:45:08,848 --> 01:45:10,713
l get angry, and then...

1156
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:16,187
l thought a lot last night.

1157
01:45:19,659 --> 01:45:21,524
l have done a lot for both of you.

1158
01:45:23,262 --> 01:45:26,197
But it was never enough.

1159
01:45:27,266 --> 01:45:28,528
And it never will be.

1160
01:45:31,537 --> 01:45:34,404
Rohan, you don't want to study

1161
01:45:35,274 --> 01:45:38,209
So there's no need to
study any more.

1162
01:45:39,612 --> 01:45:42,809
You start work full
time at the factory today.

1163
01:45:43,816 --> 01:45:46,216
You will reach one hour
earlier than the others...

1164
01:45:47,286 --> 01:45:51,279
And you leave two hours
after they leave. Okay?

1165
01:45:53,292 --> 01:45:54,350
Arjun

1166
01:45:55,294 --> 01:45:56,818
l have spoken to the principal.

1167
01:45:57,964 --> 01:45:59,955
A new semester starts in two weeks.

1168
01:46:00,967 --> 01:46:04,562
You're going to boarding school.
To study and live there.

1169
01:46:06,505 --> 01:46:07,563
Okay?

1170
01:46:14,914 --> 01:46:17,974
l've decided to marry again.
For myself.

1171
01:46:20,319 --> 01:46:21,581
l get very lonely.

1172
01:46:22,989 --> 01:46:26,390
And now that both of you won't
be here, it will get worse...

1173
01:46:28,527 --> 01:46:29,585
Okay?

1174
01:46:38,004 --> 01:46:39,266
Okay.

1175
01:46:46,679 --> 01:46:47,805
You're getting married?

1176
01:46:48,681 --> 01:46:49,739
Yes.

1177
01:46:50,883 --> 01:46:51,941
To whom?

1178
01:46:52,618 --> 01:46:53,676
Somebody.

1179
01:46:54,286 --> 01:46:55,878
And Rohan? Arjun?

1180
01:46:56,422 --> 01:47:01,621
They're insolent.
l will always be their enemy.

1181
01:47:01,827 --> 01:47:04,022
But they're your children.

1182
01:47:04,296 --> 01:47:05,763
You're sending Arjun
to boarding school?

1183
01:47:05,831 --> 01:47:06,889
He's six years old...

1184
01:47:06,966 --> 01:47:09,298
l was six when dad sent me...

1185
01:47:09,702 --> 01:47:11,567
But Arjun isn't like you.

1186
01:47:12,038 --> 01:47:14,768
Then he'll become like me.
Forget all this...

1187
01:47:15,441 --> 01:47:17,636
You want a drink?

1188
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:19,368
No.

1189
01:47:24,717 --> 01:47:27,311
Please think
about what you're doing.

1190
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:28,851
l have thought about it...

1191
01:47:29,989 --> 01:47:31,513
l took this decision after thinking.

1192
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:37,996
lf it's too much for you
we can take care of Arjun.

1193
01:47:42,068 --> 01:47:43,330
What did you say?

1194
01:47:48,474 --> 01:47:49,532
What do you mean 'too much'?

1195
01:47:49,942 --> 01:47:51,341
l mean...

1196
01:47:51,410 --> 01:47:53,537
What do you mean by 'too much'?

1197
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:57,743
We can bring him up.
Take care of him. Send him to school.

1198
01:47:58,017 --> 01:47:59,746
We have no children...
- Arjun is my son.

1199
01:48:00,419 --> 01:48:02,353
And l'm not in the
business of selling children.

1200
01:48:02,421 --> 01:48:03,752
Why take this the wrong way?

1201
01:48:03,823 --> 01:48:06,690
All l'm saying if it's too hard...
- What are you saying?

1202
01:48:06,759 --> 01:48:09,353
lt isn't my fault that
you didn't have children.

1203
01:48:09,428 --> 01:48:12,761
Adopting Arjun won't cure
your infertility will it?

1204
01:48:13,432 --> 01:48:14,694
That's not fair

1205
01:48:14,767 --> 01:48:15,825
Not fair?

1206
01:48:16,836 --> 01:48:18,098
You want to tell me what's fair?

1207
01:48:20,106 --> 01:48:21,437
Get lost...

1208
01:48:24,710 --> 01:48:26,439
What is your problem?

1209
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:30,712
Why can't you ever see anyone happy?

1210
01:48:30,783 --> 01:48:31,841
l'm tired.

1211
01:48:32,518 --> 01:48:34,383
l'm tired of making everyone happy.

1212
01:48:34,453 --> 01:48:36,978
First Father, then you.
Now these two. l can't take it.

1213
01:48:37,056 --> 01:48:39,923
Have you ever given him one chance?
- One chance?

1214
01:48:40,659 --> 01:48:43,594
l put everything into his education.
He got kicked out.

1215
01:48:43,662 --> 01:48:46,392
l begged for his admission
into College. He failed.

1216
01:48:46,465 --> 01:48:47,523
What else has he ever done?

1217
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:50,000
He's written a novel.
- He's written shit!

1218
01:48:50,603 --> 01:48:52,127
Stop encouraging him.

1219
01:48:52,805 --> 01:48:55,865
Stop living your
unfulfilled dreams through my son.

1220
01:48:56,809 --> 01:48:58,470
l don't want him to become like you.

1221
01:48:58,878 --> 01:48:59,936
Like me?

1222
01:49:00,079 --> 01:49:02,411
Look at yourself...

1223
01:49:03,149 --> 01:49:06,084
Big Fat Bloody Loser.

1224
01:49:08,621 --> 01:49:11,954
What are you looking at? Get out!

1225
01:49:32,178 --> 01:49:33,440
Uncle

1226
01:49:33,512 --> 01:49:35,446
Where are you going?
- l'm going home.

1227
01:49:35,514 --> 01:49:37,778
Take me with you.
- No...

1228
01:49:37,850 --> 01:49:39,511
Please uncle
- You have to stay here.

1229
01:49:39,585 --> 01:49:40,916
Arjun needs you.

1230
01:49:40,986 --> 01:49:42,112
He's going to boarding school.

1231
01:49:42,188 --> 01:49:45,055
He'll need you when he gets back.

1232
01:49:45,724 --> 01:49:47,123
You're his only friend.

1233
01:49:47,193 --> 01:49:49,525
Please uncle.
- Come on Rohan.

1234
01:49:49,595 --> 01:49:50,926
Don't do this to me right now.

1235
01:49:50,996 --> 01:49:54,591
Please uncle. - Don't do this
to me right now. - Please uncle

1236
01:49:55,467 --> 01:49:56,525
Uncle!

1237
01:50:16,222 --> 01:50:18,087
No Papa... No Papa...

1238
01:50:18,691 --> 01:50:21,558
Papa not that. Please...
Papa not that. Please...

1239
01:50:21,827 --> 01:50:23,954
Sir please not that...

1240
01:50:52,858 --> 01:51:04,201
Against the rising waves Your
boat is helpless and tired.

1241
01:51:04,270 --> 01:51:15,272
Living one gasp at a time...
Your boat is helpless and tired.

1242
01:51:15,814 --> 01:51:26,281
Though the currents
are against you...

1243
01:51:26,358 --> 01:51:29,555
lt's time to make a difference.

1244
01:51:56,021 --> 01:52:00,117
Hoist the sail with courage...

1245
01:52:00,192 --> 01:52:07,030
This is all about your pride.

1246
01:52:07,599 --> 01:52:12,935
Shout ahoy and push ahead.

1247
01:52:13,005 --> 01:52:18,739
This is all about your pride.

1248
01:52:18,811 --> 01:52:24,340
Conquer. Raise the victory flag,

1249
01:52:24,416 --> 01:52:29,615
lt's time to do or die.

1250
01:52:30,189 --> 01:52:33,124
Fly and reach for the sun...

1251
01:52:33,192 --> 01:52:41,361
Leave behind the darkness.

1252
01:52:44,837 --> 01:52:46,634
This is my son Rohan.

1253
01:52:46,772 --> 01:52:48,831
Rohan, this is Madhavi.

1254
01:52:49,108 --> 01:52:50,769
Hi Rohan. lt's nice to meet you.

1255
01:52:51,043 --> 01:52:52,101
Hello.

1256
01:52:52,911 --> 01:52:54,310
And this is her daughter Richa.

1257
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:56,041
Richa, say hello...

1258
01:52:56,181 --> 01:52:57,239
Hello.

1259
01:53:00,052 --> 01:53:01,383
Go wash up.

1260
01:53:02,187 --> 01:53:03,245
Come on.

1261
01:53:09,862 --> 01:53:21,672
Powerful storms will shake you...

1262
01:53:21,740 --> 01:53:26,803
lf you surrender to a whirlpool ...

1263
01:53:26,879 --> 01:53:32,943
What good is your might?

1264
01:53:33,018 --> 01:53:35,851
Let the light
in your heart overcome

1265
01:53:35,921 --> 01:53:38,685
Break away from the night...

1266
01:53:38,757 --> 01:53:43,854
Master the tides...

1267
01:53:44,363 --> 01:53:49,357
So that the seas may salute you.

1268
01:53:49,435 --> 01:53:52,700
Happy birthday to you.

1269
01:53:52,838 --> 01:53:53,930
You're 18 years old now.

1270
01:53:55,107 --> 01:53:56,836
You've become a man, which
is why l'm giving this to you.

1271
01:53:57,843 --> 01:53:59,435
This was my grandfather's watch.

1272
01:54:01,313 --> 01:54:03,304
He gave it to my father
who then gave it to me

1273
01:54:04,850 --> 01:54:06,215
when l turned 18.

1274
01:54:08,787 --> 01:54:10,084
See that you continue the tradition.

1275
01:54:18,797 --> 01:54:21,732
Living one gasp at a time...

1276
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:27,067
Your boat is helpless and tired.

1277
01:54:30,242 --> 01:54:32,802
Do you think you're the
Only one who has problems?

1278
01:54:33,278 --> 01:54:35,405
Are we all sitting on a lotus flower?

1279
01:54:36,482 --> 01:54:40,441
You don't have the balls
to stand up to your father.

1280
01:54:41,153 --> 01:54:46,352
So just sit here with us,
drink, write and cry like a girl.

1281
01:54:47,759 --> 01:54:52,355
Though the currents
are against you...

1282
01:54:52,431 --> 01:54:55,195
lt's time to make a difference.

1283
01:54:55,367 --> 01:55:01,772
We're having a blast in Bombay.
Remember Vikram's papa's restaurant?

1284
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:04,907
Vikram convinced him to
let him run it for a month.

1285
01:55:05,110 --> 01:55:11,310
Uncle agreed. So Benoy and
l went to help. And guess what?

1286
01:55:11,783 --> 01:55:13,978
Profits doubled in our first month!

1287
01:55:14,052 --> 01:55:15,110
Really?

1288
01:55:15,187 --> 01:55:18,782
Really, it's great. The restaurant
is ours. Uncle retired.

1289
01:55:19,057 --> 01:55:21,992
We work and eat goodies all day.

1290
01:55:22,528 --> 01:55:24,792
Girls are actually talking to us.

1291
01:55:25,197 --> 01:55:27,791
Benoy got laid!

1292
01:55:27,866 --> 01:55:31,131
His girlfriend hangs
with us all day...

1293
01:55:31,537 --> 01:55:34,005
lf you were here you'd be so happy.

1294
01:55:34,206 --> 01:55:36,003
Come to Bombay.

1295
01:55:37,142 --> 01:55:38,200
Hello.

1296
01:55:38,944 --> 01:55:40,002
Rohan?

1297
01:55:40,412 --> 01:55:42,004
Rohan, are you there?

1298
01:55:42,347 --> 01:55:46,147
Listen, l have to go,
l'll call later.

1299
01:55:46,218 --> 01:55:49,483
Wait, talk to Benoy and Vikram...

1300
01:55:50,222 --> 01:55:52,213
ROHAN!!!!

1301
01:58:13,031 --> 01:58:14,692
He was so drunk

1302
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:17,029
That he couldn't even stand straight.

1303
01:58:18,370 --> 01:58:19,428
The car?

1304
01:58:20,972 --> 01:58:22,030
Buy a new one.

1305
01:58:22,974 --> 01:58:24,032
Where ?

1306
01:58:28,180 --> 01:58:30,171
Not him. The car.

1307
02:00:04,409 --> 02:00:05,467
When do you leave
for boarding school?

1308
02:00:06,278 --> 02:00:07,336
Tomorrow.

1309
02:00:08,079 --> 02:00:09,137
Good Luck.

1310
02:01:10,275 --> 02:01:11,333
Where are you going?

1311
02:01:12,410 --> 02:01:13,468
l'm leaving home.

1312
02:01:15,547 --> 02:01:18,812
Why? Are you unhappy
with my marriage?

1313
02:01:18,884 --> 02:01:21,682
No. Not at all. l'm delighted.

1314
02:01:22,754 --> 02:01:24,346
Your frustrations will
come out somewhere else.

1315
02:01:24,756 --> 02:01:26,417
And Arjun won't need to
go to the hospital again.

1316
02:01:29,361 --> 02:01:30,419
Excuse me.

1317
02:01:33,832 --> 02:01:34,890
Rohan.

1318
02:01:35,901 --> 02:01:37,163
Rohan.

1319
02:01:58,657 --> 02:02:00,181
You fucker...

1320
02:04:31,442 --> 02:04:32,500
l'm going to Bombay.

1321
02:04:37,314 --> 02:04:38,372
What will you do there?

1322
02:04:40,050 --> 02:04:41,847
l'll work in Vikram's restaurant.

1323
02:04:44,054 --> 02:04:47,387
l'll write. l'll clean toilets.

1324
02:04:47,925 --> 02:04:49,324
But l won't ever come back.

1325
02:10:06,109 --> 02:10:13,572
Though our feet be chained,
Dreams will ever float free.

1326
02:10:15,385 --> 02:10:23,258
Even tender sprouts break
through the mighty earth.

1327
02:10:24,528 --> 02:10:33,129
Hopeful hearts can hold no fear...

1328
02:10:34,137 --> 02:10:44,138
When they listen to
their inner voice.

1329
02:10:46,283 --> 02:10:47,341
Hi.

1330
02:10:50,754 --> 02:10:52,153
Sir's gone to get an autorickshaw.

1331
02:10:52,222 --> 02:10:53,280
Let him go.

1332
02:10:53,623 --> 02:10:54,681
You're coming with me.

1333
02:10:55,559 --> 02:10:57,151
Sir asked me to wait here.

1334
02:10:57,361 --> 02:11:02,162
Forget what Sir said. Do you
want to go to boarding school?

1335
02:11:02,833 --> 02:11:05,165
You will come with me wherever l go.

1336
02:11:09,773 --> 02:11:10,831
l'll be back in a moment.

1337
02:11:20,183 --> 02:11:24,779
How do you cage the morning rays?

1338
02:11:24,855 --> 02:11:29,451
How do you cage someone's thoughts?

1339
02:11:29,659 --> 02:11:34,460
Just as soon as birds grow wings,

1340
02:11:34,531 --> 02:11:39,195
They soar high up in the sky.

1341
02:11:39,269 --> 02:11:43,865
How do you cage the morning rays?

1342
02:11:44,207 --> 02:11:48,610
How do you cage someone's thoughts?

1343
02:11:50,213 --> 02:11:51,271
Ready?

1344
02:11:51,348 --> 02:11:53,612
Just as soon as birds grow wings,

1345
02:11:53,817 --> 02:11:58,686
They soar high up in the sky.

1346
02:12:17,641 --> 02:12:22,442
Freedom...

1347
02:12:22,646 --> 02:12:26,582
Freedom...

1348
02:12:27,250 --> 02:12:36,454
Can never be asked for.

1349
02:12:36,860 --> 02:12:41,661
Freedom...

1350
02:12:41,865 --> 02:12:45,460
Freedom...

1351
02:12:46,536 --> 02:12:56,275
Seize it and live forever free.

1352
02:12:56,346 --> 02:13:00,749
l'm taking Arjun with me.

1353
02:13:01,017 --> 02:13:05,545
How do you cage someone's thoughts?

1354
02:13:05,689 --> 02:13:10,490
Just as soon as birds grow wings,

1355
02:13:10,627 --> 02:13:15,428
They soar high up in the sky.

1356
02:13:16,299 --> 02:13:18,290
l'm taking Arjun with me.

1357
02:13:18,568 --> 02:13:20,297
lf l leave him here he will become

1358
02:13:20,570 --> 02:13:22,367
another version of you.

1359
02:13:22,706 --> 02:13:26,574
One of you is enough for this world.

1360
02:13:27,310 --> 02:13:31,713
You will never
understand why this happened.

1361
02:13:32,449 --> 02:13:38,854
Because it's a word you've
never known or experienced...

1362
02:13:39,789 --> 02:13:40,847
Love.

1363
02:13:42,058 --> 02:13:46,324
Please don't try to find us. lf you
come within a 100 kilometers of us,

1364
02:13:46,530 --> 02:13:49,522
The police will know you beat Arjun.

1365
02:13:49,933 --> 02:13:53,334
Legally, it's a criminal offence.

1366
02:13:54,337 --> 02:13:57,329
Arjun can be a lot
more than just your slave.

1367
02:13:57,674 --> 02:14:00,336
He needs a family, not a cage.

1368
02:14:00,744 --> 02:14:04,805
He needs a future, which l will make
sure he gets, whatever the cost...

1369
02:14:05,482 --> 02:14:09,748
Congratulations on your new wife,
your new daughter, your new life.

1370
02:14:10,353 --> 02:14:12,412
Your son, Rohan.

1371
02:14:13,423 --> 02:14:22,559
ls life over?. Or is
it about to begin?

1372
02:14:23,700 --> 02:14:32,369
ls this nightfall?
Or is it a new dawn?

1373
02:14:32,776 --> 02:14:38,373
Will the future bring comfort?

1374
02:14:41,718 --> 02:14:48,783
Or will bring us to a crossroad?

1375
02:14:50,794 --> 02:14:58,724
Who knows what lies ahead...
