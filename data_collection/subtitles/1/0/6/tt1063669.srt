1
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,472
Based on a true story

2
00:01:09,576 --> 00:01:12,455
THE WAVE

3
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Good morning.

4
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:11,655
Good morning.

5
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:19,605
Yes exactly, and always be on the watch
for the kids smoking in the schoolyard, OK?

6
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:24,282
<i>Hello, my precious.</i>

7
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:25,899
Well, my rocker?

8
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,350
You know we teachers are
lazy, don't spoil our image.

9
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:30,248
I only need to copy a few worksheets.

10
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:31,305
Have you already been at Kohlhage's?

11
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:32,454
No, why?

12
00:02:32,455 --> 00:02:34,204
Oh, she has asked for you.

13
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:36,205
Then I'll go.

14
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:41,076
Autocracy? I thought it was very
clear deal that I'll do Anarchy course.

15
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,550
Dieter Wieland just
presented his concept to me.

16
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:45,952
He spent whole week preparing
hard he mastered it perfectly...

17
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,960
...and I just started to
prepare over the weekend.

18
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:49,949
Yes, bit late, right.

19
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,300
Wieland, Wieland have no
idea at all about the topic.

20
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,490
I've studied in Berlin, I have lived
five years in the last house in Kreuzberg.

21
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,530
1st May, always there. So who is
better suitable to do it, than me?

22
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,866
If you really care so much then you can ask
Mr Wieland  whether he want to switch with you.

23
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,580
Could you do it again...

24
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,150
You make a deal with him yourself.

25
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,650
Mr. Wieland.

26
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:18,749
Mr Wenger.

27
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,850
It is about the issue
for the project week.

28
00:03:20,873 --> 00:03:21,899
Yes, and?

29
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,651
I wanted to ask you if you could switch?

30
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:25,471
I have Autocracy.

31
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,472
Alea iacta est.

32
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,450
The die is cast.

33
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,119
You know very well how much
I would like to teach Anarchy.

34
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:36,249
Seems even too likely to me.

35
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,965
In the Project Week we focus on teaching the students
about the benefits of the democracy for the world.

36
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:44,188
How to mix Molotov cocktails...

37
00:03:44,462 --> 00:03:46,717
...maybe only in the Chemistry lessons.

38
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
Have a Nice day.

39
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:52,949
I loved you...

40
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,650
...you have betrayed me.

41
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,503
But the dream of life,
of love, confidence,...

42
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,470
...this once real dream
I have not forgotten.

43
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,450
I want to build it
up with my billion,...

44
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,550
...change the past by destroying you.

45
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:07,749
Honey!

46
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,772
I thank you for the bouquete.

47
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,350
Would anything change, if I
lie in a box in Golden Apostle?

48
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,539
He is really ridiculous, man.

49
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,995
Not true?

50
00:04:15,996 --> 00:04:17,996
Do you really know.

51
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:24,008
I will take you in your coffin to Capri.

52
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:26,155
Moment, he says quite something else.

53
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:27,568
Now I want to say it so.

54
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:30,346
Ferdi dude, but this one time we wanted to do
it through the End, without interruption, right?

55
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:31,729
You have stopped it.

56
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,449
Supreme Theatre rule, Karo :

57
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,899
"Always continue."

58
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,050
Dennis, you wanted to compare
play's critique for capitalism...

59
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:39,051
...to current globalisation issues.

60
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,850
Yes, and that is why I also show
the play in more contemporary manner.

61
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:43,979
It is okay if it is
contemporary, but this is silly.

62
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,349
You can not enforce it.

63
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,930
Yes, we actually play Drrenmatt,
not some rubbish comedy club piece.

64
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,050
I thank you for the wreaths,
the chrysanthemums and roses.

65
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,774
Noble.

66
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,149
Hey, that sounds totally shitty!

67
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,525
Sorry, I'm most certainly not
going to to say it in that way.

68
00:04:58,526 --> 00:04:59,851
Forget it.

69
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:01,699
Quite simply, if Ferdi isn't
going to follow the script,...

70
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,700
...then I can also not play.

71
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,150
He is' still young square.

72
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,799
Oh man, I'm not in the mood any more.

73
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,750
I am leaving now, are you going with me?

74
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,271
It's really better, if...

75
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:14,272
If the piece is played
much more serious.

76
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,450
Yes, there's simply no sense
if each one does what he wants.

77
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,750
Are you coming to the game today?

78
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,250
Lisa and I have yet to learn Spanish.

79
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:24,352
Still have the whole afternoon.

80
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,450
Well, what courses
did you registered for?

81
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:28,054
Entered?

82
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:29,749
Yes, for the Project Week.

83
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,949
They hanged the lists already?

84
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,160
Sure.

85
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:33,242
I want to take Autocracy.

86
00:05:33,243 --> 00:05:35,243
Yes cool, I'll be there, too.

87
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,169
Then I must....

88
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,371
Would you sign me in too?

89
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:39,819
For what?

90
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,613
Well, for that one you are taking too.

91
00:05:41,614 --> 00:05:43,614
Okay.

92
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
See you.

93
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:10,774
Now once again pull
yourself together, okay?

94
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:12,339
Now i want to see a
real, aggressive play.

95
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,949
Pay attention to defense and
go for Konter cover, okay?

96
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:18,106
For your knowledge, we have now
8 minutes, we can do it, okay?

97
00:06:18,202 --> 00:06:20,253
Marco. Marco, this
one goes for you, too.

98
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,350
Yes, work together.

99
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,450
Yes, pay attention to the defence.

100
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,014
And hold together, play
together. Okay? 8 minutes to go.

101
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:32,701
Once more, now come, come, go.

102
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:42,361
Watch out!

103
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:45,325
Beautiful, beautiful
go to the front now!

104
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:50,702
Beautiful, Marco!

105
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,965
Give it!Give the Game! Sinan is free!

106
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:56,966
- Marco, I am free!
- Trust me just once.

107
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:02,395
Damn it, what are you doing again!?

108
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:04,396
Sinan was free!

109
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,570
...free for a date, or what?

110
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:35,272
What's wrong with you ?

111
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,530
Martin, now tell us, yes?

112
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,908
Tell me, against what can
we actually rebel today?

113
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,370
Nothing has any value anymore, yes?

114
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:40,803
Everyone has only his...
His own pleasure in mind.

115
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,049
What our generation is missing...

116
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,564
...is a common goal...
that will bring us together.

117
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:48,000
That is the spirit of
our times, get a grip.

118
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:50,518
The most googled person
in Internet is Who?

119
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,550
Paris "Fucking" Hilton.

120
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,150
- Oh, shit.
- Without shit.

121
00:08:57,565 --> 00:08:59,975
Hey, let it out. It will be better.

122
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:10,472
Stolti.

123
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,095
And Stolti, do you have some dope today?

124
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,255
Yes, of course.

125
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:22,636
And it's really one, or?

126
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:23,518
Of course,...

127
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,519
...colleague of mine brought
it from Holland yesterday.

128
00:09:26,755 --> 00:09:29,125
Is your brain completely burned out, why
are u running around with so much grass.

129
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,150
I will worry about the cops myself.

130
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,450
What do u want for it?

131
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:40,154
Nothing.

132
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:42,155
- What?
- I'll give you for free.

133
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:44,851
You are my homies.

134
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,250
<i>Monday</i>

135
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:14,654
Baby!

136
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,655
The water is totally
cool, probably 16 degrees.

137
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:20,052
Wouldn't you like to swim for a while?

138
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:21,915
That would be good for you.

139
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,704
Maybe later.

140
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:25,374
How is your shoulder?

141
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,449
Is back in normal.

142
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,450
You should not overload it?

143
00:10:28,872 --> 00:10:30,872
No, no.

144
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:33,149
Do you want some coffee?

145
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,150
Yes. Thank you.

146
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:42,355
Good morning.

147
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,374
Is there something for free?

148
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,375
- All fresh, Rainer?
- I hope.

149
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:49,037
- Good morning, Rainer.
- Sinan.

150
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,843
Quite frankly I'm a bit surprised...

151
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:55,273
...that so many are interested
in the Autocracy topic.

152
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:57,351
In your place, I would
rather pick Anarchy.

153
00:10:57,527 --> 00:10:58,534
By "old fart" Wieland?

154
00:10:58,535 --> 00:11:00,535
These are your own words.

155
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:05,302
Well...

156
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:18,472
Autocracy, what is it?

157
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Come on, you have chosen that topic.

158
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,880
You must know at least
something about it.

159
00:11:25,272 --> 00:11:27,272
Well, hopefully it will
not put more stress on us.

160
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,646
Seriously, what is the meaning
of autocratic forms of government?

161
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,799
Maybe something like monarchy?

162
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,149
Not necessarily.

163
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,049
Ferdi, do u have any
thoughts about this?

164
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,050
It's a car race in
craters. (Auto-Cracy)

165
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:42,322
Now that was really
very resourceful answer.

166
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:45,849
Dictatorship perhaps?

167
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,699
Among other things, yes. Karo?

168
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,323
I think the autocracy
is if an individual...

169
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:52,405
...or a group dominate the mass.

170
00:11:52,538 --> 00:11:53,949
Exactly.

171
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,876
Autocracy derives from the Greek...

172
00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:57,347
...and means self-rule.

173
00:11:57,348 --> 00:12:01,416
Also, "Auto" from yourself and
"Kratia" from to dominate, Power.

174
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:05,283
In an autocracy an individual or a
group involved in the Government has...

175
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,054
...so much power that the laws
can change how they want it.

176
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:10,349
Do you have examples
of such systems?

177
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,428
We need to spend the
week doing something.

178
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:16,137
Oh, come on, you can think
of some form of dictatorship.

179
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:17,350
Third Reich.

180
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:19,194
Ah no, not again.

181
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:21,195
So, I did not choose
this topic for myself....

182
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:23,951
I've printed out a few
notice for you.

183
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:25,505
Not that shit all over again.

184
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:27,399
Oh man, but it's an important issue.

185
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,965
Nazi Germany was shit.
Slowly, even I understand that"

186
00:12:30,152 --> 00:12:31,899
Exactly, damned Nazis!

187
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,609
- It happened here so it's not going to
happen anymore. - Oh yes, and the Neo-Nazis?

188
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,350
We can not permanently feel guilty
for something that we did not do.

189
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:38,724
It is not just the guilt...

190
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,706
...it is also a fact that we, with our
history have a certain responsibility.

191
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:43,864
So, I am a Turk!

192
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,902
Clear responsibility, yes, but
I mean everybody knows this.

193
00:12:45,903 --> 00:12:46,903
Everyone  who?

194
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:48,534
Well, perhaps only few
dumb Easterners don't...

195
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,839
What does this mean ? I'm
also from East Germany.

196
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,749
You exactly know what
I mean, here bald heads.

197
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,250
Rainer, can't we talk
about anything else?

198
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:56,523
- What?
- Let talk about the Bush administration.

199
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
Wait a minute, It just
started to be interesting.

200
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,138
So, your opinion is that the dictatorship
in Germany is no longer possible, yes?

201
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:04,195
No way, we are much
more enlightened now.

202
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,750
Marco, what do you mean?

203
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,850
I do not know.

204
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,509
Well, we will have ten minute break.

205
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,450
What's going on here?

206
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:49,438
We have rearranged the tables, now
everybody has at least some place.

207
00:13:49,506 --> 00:13:51,506
Bring your tables behind.

208
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:02,297
Possibly we can manage the
Project Week in a way as we want.

209
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,550
I suggest that we loosen
that whole thing a bit.

210
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,550
Has anyone anything against it?

211
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:10,834
Very good.

212
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:14,497
What is the basic foundation
for autocratic system?

213
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,699
Dennis?

214
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,800
An ideology.

215
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:19,249
Yes, what else?

216
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,678
Control.

217
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,752
Monitoring.

218
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:23,753
You think a bit too far.

219
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,654
Dissatisfaction.

220
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:27,604
Interesting.

221
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,772
But what I mean is: What is the
thing that any dictatorship has?

222
00:14:29,872 --> 00:14:31,654
We have already spoken
about it earlier.

223
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:33,149
A leader, man

224
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,949
A leader?

225
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,097
Yes, bringing out a word leader (Fuhrer)
will only make this discussion harder.

226
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:38,519
But each dictatorship
has a central leader.

227
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,983
We can play a game here. So who
could be a leader here, among us?

228
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:43,651
You, as a teacher. Of course.

229
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:45,406
- I?
- Who else?

230
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:47,882
Well, I was hoping that somebody
else wanted to start first, perhaps.

231
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,150
I'm gonna' do it... I'm
going to be your Leader!

232
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:55,808
Forget it.

233
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:57,639
Rainer, you do it

234
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,639
Okay, so we agree.

235
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,297
Who want to support me during the
Project Week as your leading figure?

236
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:03,813
- Of what use can it be for us?
- Just wait a while.

237
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,650
I'm going to ask in another
way, who is against? Against?

238
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,350
Abstention?

239
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:11,948
Well.

240
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:13,949
Rainer Heil!

241
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:16,127
Such a leading figure deserves respect.

242
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:20,703
Therefore, I would like to be addressed
as Mr Wenger during that whole time.

243
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,049
Mr Wenger.

244
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,050
Now he is becoming megalomaniac.

245
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,254
Hey, didn't we just voted, right?

246
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:27,864
What do you want from me, Easterner?

247
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:29,650
Now, come do it with us.

248
00:15:29,651 --> 00:15:31,651
You are not telling me what to do!

249
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,349
Watch your language, you dork.

250
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,456
Now please calm down. Come, take all
the stuff from your tables. Everything.

251
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,682
And from now on, only one who Is
permitted to speak, will speak.

252
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,249
Yes, Mr Wenger.

253
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,250
Did I give you the permission to talk?

254
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,560
No.

255
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:48,049
And one more thing, anybody
that speaks must stand up too.

256
00:15:48,262 --> 00:15:49,356
Isn't that a bit too much?

257
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:51,357
Mona.

258
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,925
Isn't that a bit too
much... ...Mr Wenger?

259
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:57,924
Do you feel what?

260
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:58,750
What?

261
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:00,751
Spontaneous stand up's are
improving the blood circulation.

262
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,734
In the case you have
a low blood pressure.

263
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:05,605
But if you are standing up than you are not
so much sleepy and you' re better focused.

264
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:09,327
You can sit down again.

265
00:16:10,851 --> 00:16:12,851
Marco, I know you're
tired from training...

266
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,157
...but sit straight.

267
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:17,583
Stretch your spine for once,
and put your feet parallel...

268
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:20,172
...and take a deep breath.

269
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:23,455
Do you feel the purpose of it?

270
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,249
Yes.

271
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,250
Marco?

272
00:16:28,168 --> 00:16:30,168
Yes, Mr Wenger, I get better air.

273
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,779
Exactly, you get better air.

274
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,849
Then we are going to
this all together now.

275
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,500
Well, all stand up,
please. Stand up together.

276
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,166
What's happening now?

277
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,167
And take a deep breath.

278
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,276
Come on, stand up all of you!

279
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:46,277
Breathe in...

280
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:49,149
...and breathe out.

281
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:52,669
- And what about you?
- Not in the mood?

282
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,670
Then you have to go.

283
00:16:55,871 --> 00:16:59,605
I don't force anyone, and that applies to
everybody. The whole thing here is voluntary.

284
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:03,814
- Stay cool now, Rainer.
- Mr Wenger.

285
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,258
Kevin, this is easy,...

286
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,259
...either you're with us or you go.

287
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:12,536
So what?

288
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,695
Let's go guys, this is much to "cranky".

289
00:17:17,948 --> 00:17:19,948
Let's go Sinan. Bombers.

290
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Comrade
Bye-bye-kowski!

291
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,170
You can sit down again.

292
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:38,671
What is even more
important in a dictatorship?

293
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:44,354
Discipline, Mr Wenger.

294
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,810
Very good, Tim.

295
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:47,811
Power through discipline.

296
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:52,805
Let's play a game of billiards.

297
00:17:54,534 --> 00:17:56,467
Noooooo...

298
00:17:56,468 --> 00:17:58,468
...i've got a better idea.

299
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:00,943
What's it dude?

300
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:02,600
I thought you are
here with M-class car?

301
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:04,876
This is my mother's car, wedding
anniversary gift from my father.

302
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:08,022
V8, 190 kW, 240 type.

303
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:11,187
I say, we bang this
Baby on the highway, or?

304
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:15,806
What about you?

305
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,120
No, I don't want to go.

306
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:19,410
How come?

307
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:20,825
Well, I going back to the classroom.

308
00:18:20,826 --> 00:18:22,448
Have you completely
lost your mind or what?

309
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,653
Dude, I failed a year twice.

310
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:26,701
Do you know what's gonna' happen
if i don't pass my final exam?

311
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:30,606
And your situation
is not better as well.

312
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:34,951
I think you made a right decision.

313
00:18:35,058 --> 00:18:37,058
Please sit behind.

314
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:39,665
Thanks to you, Rain... Mr Wenger.

315
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:42,554
We were just at the question of:

316
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,867
What are the social structures that
encourage developing of a dictatorship?

317
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:54,067
Lisa?

318
00:18:58,068 --> 00:19:00,068
So what social structures are necessary?

319
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:05,259
Also, when there is so
much injustice and...

320
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:09,905
And people just do not know
if you... well..a social....

321
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:12,405
Ferdi Hey, what is this?

322
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:14,935
Lisa, please just sit down again.

323
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,857
Take a deep breath...

324
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:20,503
...think until you have
an answer, strait one.

325
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,899
I know that you can do it.

326
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
Try again, okay?

327
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:28,520
High unemployment and social Injustice.

328
00:19:28,555 --> 00:19:32,057
Very well, high unemployment
and social injustice...

329
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:34,770
...are certainly helping
development of a dictatorship.

330
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:37,987
Tim?

331
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:39,804
A high inflation, Mr Wenger.

332
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,016
Well, inflation.

333
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:42,500
Political disenchantment.

334
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:43,598
Very well, Karo.

335
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,796
National awareness.

336
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:46,699
Yes we all have seen it
through Soccer World Cup....

337
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,700
...when suddenly all over the Germany
national flags were hanging out.

338
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,256
- That was super.
- I found it totally disgusting.

339
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:53,962
Yes, but that was one cool
thing during the World Cup.

340
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:57,452
When the Germans once again could
be proud of their own country...

341
00:19:57,453 --> 00:19:59,278
...just like any other nation, so...

342
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,279
Nationalism could
only make things worse.

343
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:03,410
And as a result of it we have
hate towards everything else.

344
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:07,171
I think what Mona want to say is...
It's something like extreme nationalism.

345
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:09,225
Can we agree?

346
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:11,732
Well.

347
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,134
Mr Wenger?

348
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,135
After the class you
call me Rainer again.

349
00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:23,258
It has been real fun today.

350
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
I also think its great that you are
getting involved. Keep up the good work.

351
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
Yeah... Mr Wenger.

352
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:40,899
Dude, be careful!

353
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,710
Be careful. Watch yourself.

354
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:44,402
Don't insult your sister.

355
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:46,153
What do you want? You
better give me some light.

356
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:47,049
But you are not allowed to smoke.

357
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,675
My father has allowed me.

358
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:50,045
Here you go.

359
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:51,400
Torsten might have said, you
can do what ever you want..

360
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:53,065
...but he surely has
not allowed you to smoke.

361
00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:55,066
At least that's not your problem!

362
00:20:57,505 --> 00:20:59,505
Let's go, leave that idiot alone.

363
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,605
- Retard.
- You're a retard.

364
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:03,606
You actually don't have a place to stay?

365
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:12,600
Hello precious.

366
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:14,110
Hello honey.

367
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,598
Do you want a drink?

368
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,599
Yes.

369
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Don't you wanna ask me how it was?

370
00:21:32,505 --> 00:21:34,099
And how was it?

371
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,132
It has been very  interesting.

372
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:38,299
Mr. Wenger has shown
us how to sit properly.

373
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,950
Upright, spine straightforward, and...

374
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,372
...you know the feeling, when you
suddenly stand up, and your eyes black out.

375
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:47,854
That's because of a low blood pressure.

376
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:49,759
More roast meet?

377
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,800
Now we must stand up each
time we need to say something.

378
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:53,799
That's a good thing for blood pressure.

379
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,105
And our answers must
always be short and concise.

380
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,476
Very nice so why don't
you do it right now?

381
00:22:01,305 --> 00:22:03,624
Suddenly we all have been fully
involved in it, such a weird energy...

382
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,625
...everybody is carried away.

383
00:22:05,822 --> 00:22:08,274
Weird is exactly the word.

384
00:22:08,556 --> 00:22:10,114
What does that mean?

385
00:22:10,115 --> 00:22:12,115
Power through discipline.

386
00:22:12,301 --> 00:22:14,301
Karo, sweetie, I'm
not so sure about it...

387
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,781
We did not educate you that way.

388
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:18,586
Would be better if you did.

389
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,587
A little bit of discipline
certainly would not harmed Leon.

390
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,106
Your brother should know
his limits by himself.

391
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Not everybody know them.

392
00:22:25,892 --> 00:22:26,810
Come again?

393
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:28,811
Kevin, for example, I
had to kick him out today.

394
00:22:28,911 --> 00:22:30,911
And that's why i'm gonna
bump you away, you fucker!

395
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:34,506
Dude, get a grip. Rainer is cool.

396
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,700
Now, you are going to turn
against me too, you traitor.

397
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,305
I also should have kicked you out.

398
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:40,724
Furthermore, Rainer did not
kick you out, Mr Wenger did it.

399
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:43,598
He never liked me....

400
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,055
...because I'm not playing
in his gay water-polo team.

401
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,700
What's actually going on?

402
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:51,540
We train really hard. I do not
know why we aren't successful.

403
00:22:52,268 --> 00:22:55,032
But we should actually win against
Ernst-Barlach Comprehensive school...

404
00:22:55,848 --> 00:22:57,848
...otherwise it's really gonna be
hard to preserve unity at the class.

405
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,333
Drop by again sometimes.

406
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:01,865
When are you playing next game?

407
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:03,866
Let's go Marco, we're going to my room.

408
00:23:04,202 --> 00:23:06,042
We wanted to watch the
game here 'till the end.

409
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:08,043
Yes, we can do it in my place as well.

410
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:10,281
And we also have to
prepare for Project Week.

411
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,965
Like what?

412
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:13,966
Could you come please?

413
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:17,204
Sorry, Torsten.

414
00:23:17,205 --> 00:23:20,009
OK then, you study
for your Project Week.

415
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,900
Well, my little honey bee.

416
00:23:25,045 --> 00:23:27,384
Should we both have
our little Project Week?

417
00:23:36,455 --> 00:23:38,455
I thought we are doing something else?

418
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,376
Look, what do you think about this?

419
00:23:43,377 --> 00:23:44,600
We will move over there one day.

420
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:46,605
Gracia is the most
fashionable area in Barcelona.

421
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,700
And the stadium is only
seven stations away.

422
00:23:50,405 --> 00:23:52,358
Is'n it a bit too far away?

423
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,359
Seven stations?

424
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:56,960
Barcelona.

425
00:23:56,961 --> 00:24:00,353
Is it beautiful, right on
the sea, City of artists.

426
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:05,162
Don't you think your
family is going to miss you?

427
00:24:05,306 --> 00:24:07,306
They regularly get on my nerves anyway.

428
00:24:07,601 --> 00:24:09,351
Torsten, bees are still super-cool.

429
00:24:09,352 --> 00:24:11,352
Yes, but perhaps they are
just too cool sometimes.

430
00:24:13,106 --> 00:24:15,106
Come on, leave it alone.

431
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:18,068
Come here.

432
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:20,869
I'm not in the mood for that.

433
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,133
But don't you fly tomorrow?
There is still some time left.

434
00:24:23,376 --> 00:24:25,376
Yes, but i need to check
my reservation soon.

435
00:24:27,002 --> 00:24:29,002
Then you check it.

436
00:24:29,906 --> 00:24:31,906
Oh come, now stay bit more.

437
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:34,354
I need to do my training.

438
00:25:16,822 --> 00:25:19,233
Wait, wait, come here.

439
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:33,400
Man, what kind of shit
is this? What is that?

440
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:40,936
Damn it, you can not do just
whatever you want to do here.

441
00:25:40,937 --> 00:25:42,937
When will you finally figure that out?

442
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:44,199
Listen, man...

443
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,199
Leave me alone.

444
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,865
Listen, let us play together once, okay?

445
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:48,827
Everyone thinks you will play sole.

446
00:25:48,828 --> 00:25:51,790
I'll break cover from your
left, and than double-pass, okay?

447
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:56,008
- Okay?
- Yes.

448
00:25:58,503 --> 00:26:00,503
Out, out, you go in, yes.

449
00:26:17,105 --> 00:26:19,105
Marco Yes, this is beautiful!

450
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:21,728
Great move, with class!

451
00:26:21,811 --> 00:26:23,811
Well, finally!

452
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:27,509
Hello, honey, I'm back.

453
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,798
What's wrong with you?

454
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:36,405
Just a moment, I need to
print out something, OK?

455
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:40,142
Kiki and Alex are really pain in the ass,
in the long term, real teacher couple.

456
00:26:41,118 --> 00:26:43,118
Are we like them?

457
00:26:46,222 --> 00:26:47,598
Say, what's is this all about?

458
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,658
Only few ideas that I would
like to try out tomorrow.

459
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,420
Then, I'm in too.

460
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,098
Only if you wear a nurse costume.

461
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:02,521
We shall see.

462
00:27:02,522 --> 00:27:04,522
Do you need an injection?

463
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:07,106
- I still have this small injection for you.
- Oh, really.

464
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:08,105
It's loaded.

465
00:27:08,106 --> 00:27:09,187
- Really?
- Yes.

466
00:27:09,188 --> 00:27:11,188
Yeah, lets go then!

467
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:16,166
<i>Tuesday</i>

468
00:27:23,728 --> 00:27:26,554
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Mr Wenger!

469
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,774
I have a feeling you don't
take me seriously, do you?

470
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:34,230
No, of course we do.

471
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:36,231
Everybody stand up please.

472
00:27:36,401 --> 00:27:38,401
Repeat four times:

473
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:41,310
Now, few relaxation exercises.

474
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:43,311
For relaxing your muscles.

475
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:46,225
Particularly, for the legs, please.

476
00:27:46,805 --> 00:27:48,805
Now, all together.

477
00:27:49,282 --> 00:27:51,998
Left, right, left, right...

478
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:58,799
And what is this for?

479
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Just follow, I wish to
explain something to you.

480
00:28:01,766 --> 00:28:03,299
Yes, very good.

481
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,599
Can you feel it?

482
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,003
As we all slowly merge into one unit!

483
00:28:08,022 --> 00:28:10,022
That is the power of the community!

484
00:28:13,772 --> 00:28:15,204
How long must we do this?

485
00:28:15,205 --> 00:28:17,205
Until we all reach
absolutely same rhythm.

486
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,104
You already know that,
from dancing, Mona.

487
00:28:19,105 --> 00:28:21,450
Left, right, left... Come, one, two...

488
00:28:22,335 --> 00:28:25,117
Such vibrations can be
even bring the bridges down.

489
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,269
- Kaschi, you are completely out of the rhythm.
- Be quiet, okay.

490
00:28:29,095 --> 00:28:31,095
I think we understand this, Mr Wenger.

491
00:28:31,215 --> 00:28:33,215
I do not think so.

492
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,204
This exercise has
completely different purpose.

493
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:36,250
Which one?

494
00:28:36,251 --> 00:28:38,327
There is a Wieland's Anarchy
class right below us now!

495
00:28:39,911 --> 00:28:43,609
And I would like a plaster falling
of the ceiling on our enemies heads!

496
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:46,719
Tempo!

497
00:28:56,855 --> 00:28:58,855
Are they crazy?

498
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:02,299
<i>Power through Discipline</i>

499
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,300
Power through Community.

500
00:29:05,255 --> 00:29:07,759
You might have wondered
why did I dislocated you.

501
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,599
I would like to change
usual group order.

502
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,525
You all have friends and teams with who you
get along better, and that's also important.

503
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:17,096
But you do not walk
alone through life...

504
00:29:17,097 --> 00:29:19,352
...but together you could be
even more, much more strong.

505
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:22,542
The new seating arrangement
is also a part of a system...

506
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:24,599
...do you have any idea which system?

507
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,850
Anybody?

508
00:29:27,004 --> 00:29:29,545
Karo, what do you think why do you sit
with Jens now, not with Marco anymore?

509
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:32,399
Perhaps because we distract each other.

510
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Really, you mean that?

511
00:29:35,601 --> 00:29:37,800
Wieland teaches his students down
there to be individual fighters...

512
00:29:38,116 --> 00:29:40,335
...and believes that at the end
they will make better achievements.

513
00:29:40,336 --> 00:29:43,729
You know what I mean, nobody should copy
out, but always think about competition.

514
00:29:44,006 --> 00:29:46,206
I think this is only the way to
build a dog-eat-dog society...

515
00:29:46,221 --> 00:29:48,900
...and I am strongly convinced
if we are to help each other...

516
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:50,940
...then we are much, much stronger.

517
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:52,974
Does this means, we all
can copy out, or what?

518
00:29:53,222 --> 00:29:55,281
If that means you'll have better
grades at the end, then yes.

519
00:29:56,623 --> 00:29:58,626
That is why I put down together
a student with a bad grade...

520
00:29:58,627 --> 00:30:00,795
...next to one with a
good grade in my class.

521
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,924
I want you to help each other.

522
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:04,825
That's total nonsense.

523
00:30:04,826 --> 00:30:06,826
- Mona? -- - Yes,
really incredible.

524
00:30:06,993 --> 00:30:08,993
Please stand up.

525
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,393
I can't believe that we are going
to compromise our self in a such way.

526
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:17,336
All those poor students sitting
in here are now feeling exposed.

527
00:30:17,722 --> 00:30:19,649
Mona, I've never talked
about poor students...

528
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,650
...just about bad grades.

529
00:30:22,699 --> 00:30:24,499
For me, there are no poor students.

530
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,320
For example, you are doing very well in my
class but in math you have bad grade, right?

531
00:30:28,066 --> 00:30:30,459
Well, Lisa has straight A in math.

532
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,500
You could help each other.

533
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:35,501
This whole thing has one more advantage.

534
00:30:36,206 --> 00:30:38,800
Our ratings as a class
would simply become better...

535
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:41,145
...at least better than
the Anarchists below us!

536
00:30:43,312 --> 00:30:45,312
I know the whole thing
might sound a bit unusual...

537
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,552
...but why don't we
try to do something new?

538
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:53,620
Hey Domi, we were quite loud, right?

539
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:57,128
What is going on at Wieland
Old Bayerish asylant' class?

540
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:59,316
I thought Anarchy is
something interesting but...

541
00:30:59,906 --> 00:31:01,499
...that guy is not interesting at all.

542
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,550
He is like a sleeping
pill, I tell you....

543
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,935
...if you haven't made that noise
up there, I would fall asleep easily.

544
00:31:06,605 --> 00:31:07,865
What was going on?

545
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,052
Just few relaxation exercises
to wake up, nothing else.

546
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,520
Relaxation exercises?

547
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:13,545
I sounded to me more like as if
the school is going to collapse.

548
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:14,820
You disrupt my classes.

549
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:17,142
It is no wonder at all that my
students are totally outraged.

550
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:18,443
Can I help you?

551
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:22,338
Yes, we wanted to ask whether we could
still switch to the Autocracy class.

552
00:31:22,745 --> 00:31:24,745
But as soon as possible.

553
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:32,246
Last time we stopped at Community topic.

554
00:31:32,247 --> 00:31:34,247
How can you recognise a Community?

555
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,399
By the spirit of Community, Mr Wenger.

556
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,480
Yes, that is true, but try to
give me more visual example.

557
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:42,865
Lisa?

558
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:44,305
By the clothes, Mr Wenger.

559
00:31:44,306 --> 00:31:46,306
Exactly, common clothing.

560
00:31:47,211 --> 00:31:49,674
One could also say by uniforms.

561
00:31:49,913 --> 00:31:51,605
Yes, but uniforms are shit.

562
00:31:51,606 --> 00:31:53,606
Dominic.

563
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:57,876
Also, I think uniforms
are totally fascistic.

564
00:31:57,993 --> 00:31:59,993
It might be so, but not
necessarily military uniforms.

565
00:32:00,494 --> 00:32:01,707
There are uniforms everywhere...

566
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:04,132
...in supermarket, at Mc Donald's,
flight-attenders, police-woman...

567
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:06,601
...even suits are some kind dress code.

568
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:09,536
Or what about that thing you are wearing
right now, isn't it some kind of uniform?

569
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:11,601
You do belong to a
certain group, don't you?

570
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Lisa?

571
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,800
Yes, but uniforms have
other purpose as well.

572
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:21,455
They eliminate social differences.

573
00:32:21,663 --> 00:32:24,133
Yes, they do, but also they
eliminate individuality.

574
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:26,966
Mona, please stand up.

575
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Lisa, explain it more accurately.

576
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,199
Well, I mean...

577
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,976
...every morning we are
stressed up about what to wear.

578
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,255
That would be completely unnecessary
if we all wear a same uniform.

579
00:32:38,926 --> 00:32:39,599
Karo?

580
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,216
I've heard that, in Hamburg they discuss whether
school uniforms should be introduced again.

581
00:32:43,316 --> 00:32:45,316
Does that make any sense to you?

582
00:32:46,013 --> 00:32:48,013
Sinan?

583
00:32:48,126 --> 00:32:51,661
Yeah, but should make them cheap,
so that everyone can afford them.

584
00:32:54,202 --> 00:32:56,202
Marco, you could tell
us more about this.

585
00:33:02,506 --> 00:33:08,164
Stephon Marbury of New York Knicks, made
the basketball shoe that cost only $14.99.

586
00:33:08,801 --> 00:33:10,801
"Starbury One".

587
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,949
Yes, he was also born in the ghetto
and wanted to put to a stop...

588
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,400
...the fact kids buying overpriced Nike
Air, and let them buy affordable sneakers.

589
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,348
This is not really so good example, how
could he made them so cheap to the market?

590
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:23,051
Because they are made in
Chinese "slave factories"?

591
00:33:24,188 --> 00:33:26,188
No, he simply did not spend
so much money for advertising.

592
00:33:26,823 --> 00:33:29,772
Nike spends hundreds of
millions for advertising.

593
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:32,452
Beckham took millions for
that Adidas commercial.

594
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,300
What do you think about that if, during the
Project Week, we introduce some sort of...

595
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:39,899
...school uniform?

596
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,710
What?

597
00:33:40,711 --> 00:33:42,035
And what?

598
00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:44,702
I don't know, maybe some simple jeans,
a white shirt, one that everybody have.

599
00:33:45,598 --> 00:33:48,330
- But, I don't have white shirt.
- Good, then you just buy one.

600
00:33:48,516 --> 00:33:50,712
Oh come on please, I'm not
going to spend any money on that.

601
00:33:50,901 --> 00:33:52,439
Come on, but it costs next to nothing.

602
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,440
Jens, stand up please.

603
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,807
I have two white shirts at
home. You could have one of them.

604
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:01,092
That is what I call team spirit, Jens.

605
00:34:01,093 --> 00:34:03,093
Very good.

606
00:34:03,715 --> 00:34:05,715
Then we will do it like that.

607
00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:24,950
- Two times, same shirt.
- Correct.

608
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:26,951
I just had sold a white one.

609
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:28,799
110, please.

610
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,666
Thank you.

611
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:30,857
- Bye.
- Your receipt?

612
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:32,858
- No, no, its OK, thank you.
- Okay, bye.

613
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
- Hello!
- Hello!

614
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Is that the latest fashion, or what?

615
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:43,825
45, please.

616
00:34:52,812 --> 00:34:55,573
Excuse me, but there maybe
some of my stuff as well.

617
00:34:57,922 --> 00:34:59,922
Where do you think you are going?

618
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:01,942
Why?

619
00:35:01,943 --> 00:35:03,943
You look like you just went
out of the convent school.

620
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
But, I like it.

621
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,600
<i>Wednesday</i>

622
00:35:45,201 --> 00:35:47,183
Where is your white shirt?

623
00:35:47,184 --> 00:35:48,184
I'm not in a mood for it.

624
00:35:48,185 --> 00:35:49,607
Why?

625
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:51,608
White is not for me at all.

626
00:35:52,115 --> 00:35:53,609
Oh really.

627
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,610
Once again, a matter of vanity.

628
00:35:55,856 --> 00:35:58,416
I simply don't want to make no
excuse because of some shitty shirt.

629
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:02,056
You see, this is exactly
what Mr Wenger taught,...

630
00:36:02,516 --> 00:36:04,516
...that is selfish.

631
00:36:20,922 --> 00:36:22,499
Karo, but we have already agreed
that we all take part in this.

632
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
Leave me alone!

633
00:36:25,408 --> 00:36:27,408
White does not suit her.

634
00:36:32,588 --> 00:36:34,588
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

635
00:36:35,311 --> 00:36:38,330
Mona has switched for another course, but
we have a some growth in attendance here.

636
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:40,414
Find yourself some space and sit.

637
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:42,410
Now, we are finally full.

638
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:44,837
But Jules Barman and Frederick
Claussen also wanted to join us.

639
00:36:45,427 --> 00:36:46,627
Unfortunately, full means full.

640
00:36:46,628 --> 00:36:48,528
Dennis?

641
00:36:48,529 --> 00:36:51,609
Considering the fact there are so many of us
right now, we could give some name to the group?

642
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:55,363
Very well, that also would have been my
next point, do you have any suggestions?

643
00:36:56,555 --> 00:36:58,231
Sinan?

644
00:36:58,232 --> 00:37:00,232
Terror Squad.

645
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:02,199
Please, I meant seriously.

646
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,465
Dennis?

647
00:37:03,466 --> 00:37:05,466
Visionaries Club.

648
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:06,898
Marco?

649
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:07,754
The Wave.

650
00:37:07,755 --> 00:37:08,880
I expected that one form you.

651
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:11,174
- This is cool, isn't it? Suites fine.
- Right.

652
00:37:11,555 --> 00:37:12,965
Tim?

653
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:14,883
Tsunami.

654
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:16,884
Too hard.

655
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:18,085
Kaschi?

656
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:19,701
The Base.

657
00:37:19,702 --> 00:37:20,887
The Pact.

658
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:22,688
The  "White Giant"
(German detergent brand)

659
00:37:22,689 --> 00:37:23,705
The Inner Circle.

660
00:37:23,706 --> 00:37:25,706
The Risen.

661
00:37:26,326 --> 00:37:27,401
The Centre.

662
00:37:27,402 --> 00:37:29,402
The Centre, is good.

663
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,666
Anybody else with good idea?

664
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,050
Nobody?

665
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
Karo?

666
00:37:43,922 --> 00:37:45,922
The Changers?

667
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:48,033
The Changers.

668
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,988
Well, we have collected a nice bunch, I
will write down some of the better names.

669
00:37:56,968 --> 00:37:58,968
Visionaries Club...

670
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:02,869
...Base.

671
00:38:03,895 --> 00:38:05,895
With that we reached
to the last proposal.

672
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
The Changers.

673
00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:13,596
Here is the result. From now
on we are called "The Wave".

674
00:38:20,811 --> 00:38:22,526
This is totally good.

675
00:38:22,527 --> 00:38:24,027
Really, now I can pay better attention.

676
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:26,224
No, really, its good. Maybe
you could make us some logo.

677
00:38:27,411 --> 00:38:29,966
- What?
- Yes. You will be making our logo, OK.

678
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:32,984
This brings us to the next
stage: Power by Action.

679
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:36,855
What are all these ideas good for,
if we just sit down without acting?

680
00:38:37,124 --> 00:38:40,120
I wish you dedicate all of
your creativity to The Wave...

681
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,600
...for the benefit of entire community.

682
00:38:41,601 --> 00:38:43,622
Okay then, I will make
us a profile on My Space.

683
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:45,873
- Totally!
- I always wanted to do that.

684
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:47,351
You all can do it together.

685
00:38:47,352 --> 00:38:49,880
Yeah, but I better make
something on my own.

686
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,110
Look, then just make your
own personal homepage.

687
00:38:52,111 --> 00:38:54,841
Indeed, When Sinan  makes us
logo, we can also make badges.

688
00:38:55,263 --> 00:38:56,763
My aunt have a machine for that.

689
00:38:56,764 --> 00:38:58,764
We might even do tattoos,
like here on the arm.

690
00:38:59,365 --> 00:39:00,714
Postcards that we could...

691
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:02,715
And then we do hats.

692
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:29,687
Hey, what's up, dude?

693
00:39:30,211 --> 00:39:32,511
Look, that buddy of mine is little
bit dry for the stuff lately.

694
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,119
Man, I've heard you can get some stuff.

695
00:39:36,728 --> 00:39:38,505
I will pay for it, dude.

696
00:39:38,506 --> 00:39:40,506
Go to the slums.

697
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,416
What going on back there?

698
00:39:49,618 --> 00:39:51,587
They fuck with Stoltefuss, what else?

699
00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:53,588
For Anarchy lice like
yourself, there's nothing.

700
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,626
What?

701
00:39:59,703 --> 00:40:01,703
What's that cute little shirt on you?

702
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,199
Your mother bought you?

703
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,491
Leave me alone, you fucker!

704
00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:06,492
Hey, relax, will you.

705
00:40:10,693 --> 00:40:12,693
Is there a problem here, or what?

706
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:14,354
Two more of them.

707
00:40:14,355 --> 00:40:15,599
What?

708
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Are you guys some sort of gang, or what?

709
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:19,601
If you don't leave Tim alone you
will get some beating, understood?

710
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,001
Everything cool.

711
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:24,922
You fascist assholes!

712
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,360
These Anarchy fags torn my shirt.

713
00:40:30,815 --> 00:40:33,458
You can't let these dorks
pick on you so easily.

714
00:40:34,222 --> 00:40:35,499
But you were here.

715
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,500
We can't always be around you.

716
00:40:39,515 --> 00:40:42,314
Hey Tim, I'll give
you my cell number, OK?

717
00:40:42,811 --> 00:40:46,205
If these bastards trouble
you ever again, call me, okay?

718
00:40:49,106 --> 00:40:51,106
Yes.

719
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:59,522
What have just happened?

720
00:41:00,534 --> 00:41:03,358
I really don't know, she is upset.

721
00:41:04,605 --> 00:41:07,282
She is always like that lately,
she doesn't let me any closer.

722
00:41:07,816 --> 00:41:09,869
Even I have noticed that lately.

723
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:12,637
Her determination sometimes annoys me.

724
00:41:13,312 --> 00:41:17,529
She make her plans without even
listening what I really want...

725
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:21,039
Why should I have to
follow her to Spain anyway?

726
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:26,857
Until I get there in 10 months, she might
already find some Juan or Miguel or whoever.

727
00:41:32,602 --> 00:41:34,602
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose her.

728
00:41:42,853 --> 00:41:44,387
Karo, Dennis is here, where are you?

729
00:41:44,388 --> 00:41:46,199
We are all waiting for you,
here is the total chaos...

730
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,302
...please call us back when
you hear this message, OK?

731
00:41:59,026 --> 00:42:01,002
- Mailbox.
- I said so.

732
00:42:01,003 --> 00:42:03,003
But she knows that we
want do rehearsal today.

733
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:05,899
It is not such a great loss anyway.

734
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,726
She is probably pissed because we
didn't vote for "Changers" today.

735
00:42:09,906 --> 00:42:13,105
Anyway, I have much better things to do, than
to wait for the princess for the whole day long.

736
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:15,228
I'm going with you.

737
00:42:15,229 --> 00:42:16,854
Wait a bit.

738
00:42:16,855 --> 00:42:18,855
Hey, Lisa, I will go now,
this became too stupid to me.

739
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,900
If you leave now, we can
completely forget the whole piece!

740
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Do you want that?

741
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:29,078
I know that we can create
something really great here.

742
00:42:29,733 --> 00:42:31,733
A good piece, which
actually says something.

743
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:35,613
Not only for amusement, but
something with a real statement.

744
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,334
But without Karo we
can't do anything here.

745
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,409
Yes, you want only her for that role!

746
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,603
I was against this stupid
voting from the beginning!

747
00:42:42,925 --> 00:42:44,925
I wanted to make
something like an audition.

748
00:42:46,366 --> 00:42:48,366
We could not elect anything anyway.

749
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:50,901
Can you leave me alone now for a bit!

750
00:42:53,902 --> 00:42:57,970
Now, for only one time, let
us do  this the way i want!

751
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:02,573
Maja, this is your chance. You
play the Claire Zachanassian.

752
00:43:02,704 --> 00:43:05,382
- Cool.
- And Lisa, you will take over Maja's part.

753
00:43:05,405 --> 00:43:06,310
Me?

754
00:43:06,311 --> 00:43:08,554
Yeah, you know the text
anyway, find some courage.

755
00:43:09,655 --> 00:43:13,608
And Ferdi, follow the text please,
don't make a comedy act of it, okay?

756
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,400
Yes, sir!

757
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Dude, I am glad that this day is over.

758
00:43:34,691 --> 00:43:36,691
But Rainer has really showed
us some good things today.

759
00:43:38,411 --> 00:43:40,848
No shit, you should participate
again. The Wave needs you, man.

760
00:43:42,311 --> 00:43:44,409
Gonna be like, dude, me in that crowd...

761
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,811
Don't give a fuck...

762
00:43:45,812 --> 00:43:47,843
...you don't have to join
the class, just join us.

763
00:43:55,606 --> 00:43:57,502
Hey, let us also in!

764
00:43:57,503 --> 00:43:58,399
What do you want?

765
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,721
To drive, dude, what else?

766
00:43:59,722 --> 00:44:01,916
Isn't that a brother of that bitch Karo?

767
00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:03,516
You have something against it?

768
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:05,517
Your sister is a cunt!

769
00:44:05,522 --> 00:44:07,522
Tell me something new.

770
00:44:08,768 --> 00:44:10,105
That pussy is also part of The Wave.

771
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:12,110
If you want to skate here,
you need to become a member.

772
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:20,380
<i>A man sitting for his last time, in a wild
Forest full of cuckoos and a wind breeze.</i>

773
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:23,222
<i>There will be Community meeting tonight.</i>

774
00:44:25,006 --> 00:44:26,682
Dennis says, that I was
actually really good.

775
00:44:26,683 --> 00:44:28,299
<i>You tricked me.</i>

776
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,574
And Maja plays my role?

777
00:44:29,575 --> 00:44:31,499
<i>...the dream of life...</i>

778
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,500
Yes, it was just an attempt.

779
00:44:33,801 --> 00:44:35,186
<i>...once the real dream...</i>

780
00:44:35,187 --> 00:44:36,416
Why did not you come?

781
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:38,417
<i>...that I had not forget.</i>

782
00:44:38,518 --> 00:44:39,665
I wasn't feeling good.

783
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:45,070
<i>I thank you for the wreaths,
the chrysanthemums and roses.</i>

784
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,350
And suddenly Ferdi follows
the the script, right?

785
00:44:48,411 --> 00:44:51,024
I say yes, Dennis had really
showed how the things should work.

786
00:44:51,503 --> 00:44:54,255
Haven't you all united against
me in those white shirts?

787
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:55,499
That's a nonsense.

788
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,500
Since I was not around,
everything was going well.

789
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,928
Karo, you are only angry because we have
not voted for your proposal this morning.

790
00:45:01,197 --> 00:45:01,955
What?

791
00:45:01,956 --> 00:45:04,399
Can't you see that you are getting
on everybody's nerves with your way.

792
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:05,798
Are you just mad, or what?

793
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:07,385
Have you ever thought the fact...

794
00:45:07,386 --> 00:45:09,593
...that Marco has no will
to follow you to Spain?

795
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,814
How come is that?

796
00:45:10,815 --> 00:45:12,460
Because he's told me so.

797
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:14,294
Oh, really, he told you that, ha?

798
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,295
He told you other stuff
also, how often we have sex?

799
00:45:16,726 --> 00:45:18,497
You talk shit, you know?

800
00:45:18,498 --> 00:45:19,887
I talk shit, ha?

801
00:45:19,888 --> 00:45:22,816
I wish I can see how would you acting if I talked
with your boyfriend about your relationship problems.

802
00:45:22,955 --> 00:45:25,435
I have no relationship problems
since I have no relationship.

803
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:27,822
You don't even have a friend,
if you have not yet noticed.

804
00:45:27,968 --> 00:45:29,968
But it is, as always,
only about yourself anyway.

805
00:45:30,555 --> 00:45:33,700
Do you know what? Maja was really
good today. Much better than you are.

806
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,888
But you don't care
about this role anyway.

807
00:45:35,889 --> 00:45:38,700
You're pissed off just because
The Wave does not follow your rule!

808
00:45:39,685 --> 00:45:41,371
Shitty feeling, right?

809
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:43,372
Get used.

810
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,425
- And?
- Hi.

811
00:45:50,426 --> 00:45:52,426
Wait a sec, I want
to show you something.

812
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,507
- Here.
- What is it?

813
00:45:55,508 --> 00:45:57,314
You know that Kaschi is
a computer junkie, right?

814
00:45:57,315 --> 00:45:59,700
This afternoon he made My space
site, we are already on-line.

815
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,800
- That's cool.
- Super cool.

816
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:08,499
Precious?

817
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,099
Yes.

818
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,765
Kaschi is totally motivated.

819
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:12,766
The kids are going
through a real change.

820
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,100
Surer. indeed.

821
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,405
You and your white shirts.

822
00:46:17,406 --> 00:46:19,306
Oh yes, I've forgot to change clothes.

823
00:46:19,307 --> 00:46:21,307
They already talk about
you at the councillor's.

824
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,330
I don't give a damn, they always do.

825
00:46:24,122 --> 00:46:25,957
But since when do you got interested?

826
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:27,958
I just say.

827
00:47:24,555 --> 00:47:26,499
- This is our sign.
- Cool.

828
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,801
As a Wave, we will flood the whole City!

829
00:47:45,928 --> 00:47:48,642
Up on the wall it really
rules, guys. Respect!

830
00:47:50,003 --> 00:47:51,299
What is he doing here?

831
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,199
What is going on with you, retard?

832
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,631
You should happy that
you can be here today.

833
00:47:54,632 --> 00:47:56,158
Hey, relax a bit!

834
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,185
The Wave is a movement...

835
00:47:57,186 --> 00:47:59,186
...in which everyone can
join, if one feels the link.

836
00:47:59,234 --> 00:48:00,902
Yeah, Tim is right.

837
00:48:00,903 --> 00:48:03,161
Kevin didn't want to be part of it
from the beginning, why now suddenly?

838
00:48:03,226 --> 00:48:04,449
Oh, come on.

839
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,399
Kevin had printed out 5000 stickers.

840
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,254
That shows that he deserves
to be Wave's member.

841
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:10,255
Yeah, sponsored by his daddy.

842
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,799
I think Mr Wenger should decide
whether he is still involved or not.

843
00:48:13,345 --> 00:48:15,325
Mr Wenger has taught us
something about the community.

844
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:16,800
Only together we are strong.

845
00:48:16,801 --> 00:48:18,099
I don't know about you guys, but I...

846
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,700
...think that Mr Wenger would be
against hacking the whole city down.

847
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,799
I also think that you take this thing
a little bit too seriously, right?

848
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
I mean, we just want to have fun, or?

849
00:48:25,341 --> 00:48:27,341
I see.

850
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,412
Then grab the things
together and lets move, right?

851
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,100
Do you all have stickers?

852
00:48:44,701 --> 00:48:46,749
Here is the template.
I've got five pieces.

853
00:48:51,545 --> 00:48:53,505
- Let's go!
- Can we go with you?

854
00:48:53,506 --> 00:48:55,506
Get into the car, we're moving!

855
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
What is going on here?
Are you crazy?

856
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,200
Boys, wait a bit.

857
00:50:16,479 --> 00:50:18,479
What's up with you, retard?

858
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,749
Lets paint over this
Anarchy-fuckers shit.

859
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,300
Each one of them...

860
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,273
Don't be upset about it,
she could have been with us.

861
00:51:02,955 --> 00:51:04,955
- Talking about devil.
- Hey, don't go to her now.

862
00:51:05,088 --> 00:51:07,369
If you are always available
to her, she may become bored.

863
00:51:08,022 --> 00:51:10,631
Believe me, I am a girl,
I know the way we think.

864
00:51:12,605 --> 00:51:14,605
Come on Marco, lets go!

865
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,141
Dude, you know would totally rule?

866
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:35,788
If we spray the Wave up there.

867
00:51:35,789 --> 00:51:37,299
How cool is that?

868
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,800
Lets move.

869
00:51:38,801 --> 00:51:40,801
I'll do that.

870
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,100
What?

871
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,299
I will climb up as high.

872
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,210
Dude, stop that shit!

873
00:51:48,211 --> 00:51:50,211
Forget it, we must go away.

874
00:52:23,126 --> 00:52:25,015
Give me your cellphone.

875
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,016
- Does it have video camera?
- Yes.

876
00:52:33,222 --> 00:52:35,222
Hey, the guy is total Psycho.

877
00:52:35,356 --> 00:52:37,299
Totally.

878
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,300
He even took a video of
his sister banging some guy.

879
00:52:39,626 --> 00:52:41,101
He has no sister.

880
00:52:41,102 --> 00:52:42,205
Who does he have?

881
00:52:42,206 --> 00:52:44,203
I know Stoltefuss from before.

882
00:52:44,204 --> 00:52:47,258
When he was young, first time he
tried alcohol he ended up in a coma.

883
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:49,305
He has an older brother.

884
00:52:49,306 --> 00:52:51,809
Computer geek at the
university. But no sister.

885
00:53:07,412 --> 00:53:10,052
Tim, man! Don't do that shit!

886
00:53:27,899 --> 00:53:29,899
Shit, guys! The cops!

887
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:03,566
<i>Thursday</i>

888
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,810
Ma'm!

889
00:54:10,422 --> 00:54:12,422
You really made a mess!

890
00:54:15,926 --> 00:54:17,940
Cool, dude, no shit! I wouldn't dare.

891
00:54:18,316 --> 00:54:20,316
I shit my pants if I have
to jump from the third.

892
00:54:20,502 --> 00:54:22,502
Whatever, I'm not afraid of heights.

893
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:26,718
- Here, guys.
- Thanks.

894
00:54:28,596 --> 00:54:30,596
No, only for Wave members.

895
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:32,916
What?

896
00:54:33,713 --> 00:54:35,500
Just kidding, here, have.

897
00:54:35,501 --> 00:54:37,667
You stick your shitty ice
cream in your ass, you bum!

898
00:54:41,666 --> 00:54:43,195
I will do it.

899
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:46,093
Hey, but you already know what
the requirements are, do you?

900
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:48,699
Don't listen to that retard.

901
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,493
Hey Turk , you there, in that white
shirt, you really talk too much.

902
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,492
Hey guys...

903
00:54:58,493 --> 00:55:00,493
...what do you think of this?

904
00:55:01,574 --> 00:55:03,888
Really cool greeting for
The Wave. Very simple.

905
00:55:04,589 --> 00:55:05,799
For our greeting or what?

906
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,700
Of course, all groups have
their own greeting. Black Power!

907
00:55:08,933 --> 00:55:10,703
- West Coast!
- East Coast, dude!

908
00:55:10,704 --> 00:55:11,900
That's Eminem.

909
00:55:11,901 --> 00:55:13,705
Nooo, that is Eminem.

910
00:55:13,706 --> 00:55:15,602
- Hang Loose.
- Or Satan.

911
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,603
Yes, even the Vulcans.

912
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:19,708
That's nice.

913
00:55:19,709 --> 00:55:21,299
Can you show me again? This way?

914
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,306
Not so high at the end.
Under the chest, here.

915
00:55:26,163 --> 00:55:27,599
Let's do it together.

916
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,905
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Mr Wenger!

917
00:55:31,101 --> 00:55:33,101
You can sit down.

918
00:55:34,955 --> 00:55:37,811
So, the last thing we did
yesterday was Power through Action.

919
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:40,102
- Fuck off, we won't let you in!
- Why not?

920
00:55:40,102 --> 00:55:42,102
Because you don't belong to The Wave.

921
00:55:45,006 --> 00:55:47,006
Leon!

922
00:55:48,005 --> 00:55:49,202
What's going on here?

923
00:55:49,203 --> 00:55:51,105
They don't let me pass through.

924
00:55:51,106 --> 00:55:53,106
What's wrong with you,
are you crazy, or what?

925
00:55:53,107 --> 00:55:55,107
We're not letting you pass trough
until you do the greeting properly.

926
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,119
What greeting, anyway?

927
00:56:02,888 --> 00:56:04,384
Good morning, Mr Wenger.

928
00:56:04,385 --> 00:56:06,165
Could I speak with you for a moment?

929
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:08,166
Karo, I missed you at my classes.

930
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:10,564
--Do you have
some time? - Yes.

931
00:56:12,322 --> 00:56:14,118
Could you do anything about that?

932
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:16,104
I persuaded him my way,
what else could I do?

933
00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:18,668
Oh, that's good. I will do some
proper talking to your brother as well.

934
00:56:19,267 --> 00:56:20,654
And The Wave?

935
00:56:20,655 --> 00:56:22,349
What about it?

936
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,350
What, you will just let it go?

937
00:56:24,909 --> 00:56:26,660
You will just give it up?

938
00:56:26,661 --> 00:56:29,040
There just one day left, we're
gonna pull this trough together.

939
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:31,452
I you asked me, it's
OK without white shirt.

940
00:56:31,692 --> 00:56:32,865
I'm sorry Rainer,...

941
00:56:32,866 --> 00:56:36,022
...but I think this whole thing
is really out of your control.

942
00:56:39,606 --> 00:56:42,199
Well, then you just
should switch the class!

943
00:56:57,126 --> 00:56:59,126
Everything okay?

944
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:06,595
And around here?

945
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,800
I thought you don't
give a damn about it.

946
00:57:12,422 --> 00:57:14,766
Mr Wenger, do you have
just one moment? In my room.

947
00:57:15,811 --> 00:57:17,811
Yes, sure.

948
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:25,975
Respected professor doctor Kohlhage, believe
me, I just want to achieve educational goal.

949
00:57:26,455 --> 00:57:28,455
You should see how the students
are unwinding themselves.

950
00:57:28,806 --> 00:57:30,806
- They are really motivated.
- I know it.

951
00:57:31,401 --> 00:57:34,499
I just wanted to let you know
that Mr Westerhofen called.

952
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,979
Jens is completely changed, he is
speaking about you in high regards.

953
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:40,498
I could not speak
directly in teacher's room.

954
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,502
You know, some of your colleagues...

955
00:57:42,503 --> 00:57:44,503
...find your educational
ways somewhat problematic...

956
00:57:44,955 --> 00:57:46,921
...but you have my support.

957
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,922
It's good for me.

958
00:57:50,899 --> 00:57:53,113
The next edition of the student newspaper
is already completely prepared...

959
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,725
...there is no way to add more.

960
00:57:54,726 --> 00:57:56,726
Yes, probably, it takes
too much time anyway.

961
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,403
We need to write e-mail to all students.
But you have all of the addresses, right?

962
00:57:59,488 --> 00:58:00,922
We can't let you have
them, privacy rules.

963
00:58:00,923 --> 00:58:03,711
I don't really give a
damn. So, I will help you.

964
00:58:03,922 --> 00:58:05,465
But really...

965
00:58:05,466 --> 00:58:08,213
...if you ask me, this thing
is going too far anyway.

966
00:58:08,701 --> 00:58:10,701
Yes, but you only want to sit
around and do nothing, right?

967
00:58:11,315 --> 00:58:14,308
No, I want to go to Kaschi's. LAN party.

968
00:58:14,707 --> 00:58:16,707
LAN party. Oh God!

969
00:58:17,317 --> 00:58:19,508
Don't loose this, OK?
I've put my sign on it.

970
00:58:32,526 --> 00:58:34,510
Hey, ready to get your asses riped off?

971
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,500
- These guys?
- Yes.

972
00:58:36,501 --> 00:58:38,501
You are also The Wave fascists, right?

973
00:58:38,502 --> 00:58:40,904
Wave fascists? Are you a retarded?

974
00:58:41,211 --> 00:58:43,211
Wacky Mr Wenger washed your brains out.

975
00:58:43,995 --> 00:58:46,476
Hey, where have you got the
idea to spray our sign out?

976
00:58:46,805 --> 00:58:48,805
I don't know what are
you talking about, fucker!

977
00:58:55,791 --> 00:58:57,499
Tim, did you lost your mind?

978
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,319
Tim! Tim!

979
00:59:06,307 --> 00:59:08,307
Don't fuck around, dude.

980
00:59:08,929 --> 00:59:11,466
Run for your life or I will
blow you your brain away!

981
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:14,166
OK, no problem.

982
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,310
Okay.

983
00:59:22,511 --> 00:59:24,511
Tim?

984
00:59:24,755 --> 00:59:27,021
Hey, they are gone, it's
OK, put the gun away.

985
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:30,713
Have you completely lost your mind now?!

986
00:59:30,714 --> 00:59:32,214
How can you walk around
with that gun in your hand?

987
00:59:32,215 --> 00:59:34,334
If only a gas-gun, take it easy.

988
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,487
I got it from Internet, it is that easy.

989
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:46,600
<i>Stop The Wave</i>

990
00:59:46,601 --> 00:59:48,099
- The goal justifies the means.
- This is not true...

991
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,899
...I will not write down
that I had that kid beaten up.

992
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,205
I just want to ignite that idea, right.
Michael Moore does that all the time.

993
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,049
I will speak only truth.

994
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:56,050
Great, then we can drop it immediately.

995
00:59:56,455 --> 00:59:58,455
Yes?

996
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,750
I've been looking for you everywhere.

997
01:00:01,201 --> 01:00:03,201
- What are you doing?
- Nothing much.

998
01:00:10,503 --> 01:00:12,503
We will have a small
beach party, wanna join us?

999
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,500
We? You mean The Wave members.

1000
01:00:17,205 --> 01:00:19,121
Yes, there will be few.

1001
01:00:19,122 --> 01:00:22,039
No thanks, without the white shirt
I am surely not welcome there.

1002
01:00:22,907 --> 01:00:24,007
It is so stupid.

1003
01:00:24,008 --> 01:00:26,536
Yeah, it is, and that's
why I am not in mood for it!

1004
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:29,599
Oh, "Bad Vibrations", I better go.

1005
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,910
You can stay around.

1006
01:00:30,911 --> 01:00:32,821
No, I have choir rehearsal.

1007
01:00:32,822 --> 01:00:34,822
And have lot of fun at The Wave party.

1008
01:00:35,011 --> 01:00:37,011
- Bye.
- See ya.

1009
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,799
What do you actually
have against The Wave?

1010
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,515
Marco, man, open your eyes.

1011
01:00:47,516 --> 01:00:49,560
The Wave is becoming
one really weird thing.

1012
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,199
You are involved too much in it.

1013
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,200
Oh, really? Then take a look at this.

1014
01:00:58,022 --> 01:01:00,022
Just the fact that the pages looks like.

1015
01:01:00,101 --> 01:01:01,598
Yes, Tim made them.

1016
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,599
He is always exaggerating.

1017
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,104
Here...

1018
01:01:06,105 --> 01:01:08,583
"Yesterday, some guy wearing a white
shirt pressed on me and said that...

1019
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,250
...unless I join The Wave,
I will loose all my friends...

1020
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,099
...because all of them
would join in soon.

1021
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,801
I just simply said that
I will think about it.

1022
01:01:14,802 --> 01:01:17,489
And than, he aggressively said
that it might be too late."

1023
01:01:18,355 --> 01:01:20,021
Too late for what, Marco?

1024
01:01:20,022 --> 01:01:22,350
Don't you understand what is going on
here? Students are under pressure here.

1025
01:01:23,506 --> 01:01:25,860
Yes, but the involvement is anonymous.

1026
01:01:26,507 --> 01:01:28,700
- How do you know if they don't cheat on it?
- Cheat?

1027
01:01:29,412 --> 01:01:31,399
Leon didn't let one
Six-grader into the school...

1028
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,488
...only because he did not want to
perform your stupid Wave greeting.

1029
01:01:36,002 --> 01:01:38,510
I'm sorry, but your brother
always acts little bit strange.

1030
01:01:38,511 --> 01:01:39,049
But no only that...

1031
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:42,053
...they even treat me like a leper
because I don't wear white shirt.

1032
01:01:43,401 --> 01:01:44,921
Why do not you just wear it?

1033
01:01:44,922 --> 01:01:46,922
Simply because I do not want.

1034
01:01:47,144 --> 01:01:50,416
But I want, because
The Wave means to me.

1035
01:01:51,106 --> 01:01:53,106
Means what?

1036
01:01:53,285 --> 01:01:55,285
Community.

1037
01:01:56,322 --> 01:01:59,130
You know that feeling very well, you
belong to a healthy family, I do not.

1038
01:02:04,866 --> 01:02:06,866
Going with me or not?

1039
01:02:13,167 --> 01:02:14,667
Can I help you sir?

1040
01:02:14,668 --> 01:02:15,865
What are you doing here?

1041
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:17,380
I need to protect you.

1042
01:02:17,381 --> 01:02:18,599
You need to do what?

1043
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,268
I want to be your bodyguard.

1044
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:22,269
What do I need a
bodyguard? Tim, go home.

1045
01:02:23,304 --> 01:02:25,074
What am I supposed to go home for?

1046
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,075
Nobody is Interested
for me there, anyway.

1047
01:02:34,808 --> 01:02:36,499
So, if you have any problem feel
free to come to talk to me...

1048
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,555
...but I do not need
no bodyguards, okay?

1049
01:02:42,114 --> 01:02:44,114
Come with me.

1050
01:02:55,322 --> 01:02:57,322
- Hello, precious!
- Hello!

1051
01:02:57,662 --> 01:02:59,662
What did Kohlhage want?

1052
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,974
Hi, Tim.

1053
01:03:03,975 --> 01:03:05,099
Hello, Mrs. Wenger.

1054
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,248
- Rainer, can I speak briefly with you.
- Yes, of course.

1055
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:12,367
What's this supposed to be?

1056
01:03:12,368 --> 01:03:15,054
It was not my idea, I have not invited
him. Suddenly he was just standing there.

1057
01:03:15,715 --> 01:03:17,715
He has nobody to take
care for him back at home.

1058
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:20,470
I had different idea about this.

1059
01:03:20,471 --> 01:03:22,497
Come, lets eat together, I
will send him home later, okay?

1060
01:03:24,517 --> 01:03:26,111
Mr Wenger...

1061
01:03:26,112 --> 01:03:28,112
...do happened to have
little bit more ginger?

1062
01:03:28,335 --> 01:03:30,335
Only then it will be really delicious.

1063
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,203
- It is really cool here.
- I told you.

1064
01:04:24,801 --> 01:04:27,863
- Say, what is actually going on with Karo?
- Why?

1065
01:04:28,211 --> 01:04:30,799
She was in the editorial and
had put a lot of stress on us.

1066
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,499
Because of The Wave?

1067
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,599
Yes, she wanted all student's personal data
to be able to send some emails and so on.

1068
01:04:36,207 --> 01:04:39,590
- Gross, no joke?
- No.

1069
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,808
<i>e-mail being sent.</i>

1070
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:53,809
<i>e-mail canceled.</i>

1071
01:05:08,193 --> 01:05:09,099
<i>No LAN connection.</i>

1072
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,314
Shit!

1073
01:05:10,315 --> 01:05:12,443
Well, first we thought of Paris...

1074
01:05:12,673 --> 01:05:14,906
...and then to Balaton lake. Balaton?

1075
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,732
But Italy, good food, beautiful women.

1076
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,599
You always need more and more.

1077
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,090
And than I thought, why don't
you sir join us as a supervisor.

1078
01:05:24,403 --> 01:05:25,599
Let's see, Tim.

1079
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,981
Tuscany, also, it would be superb.

1080
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,300
You know Tim, Rainer can
not decide on his own.

1081
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:33,000
Yes, but I am sure all
students would support it.

1082
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,100
And if not, we could
organize signature action.

1083
01:05:38,011 --> 01:05:40,011
It was really nice evening, Tim. Really.

1084
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,595
But Anke and I, we would like to be alone,
we have a couple of things to discuss.

1085
01:05:44,403 --> 01:05:46,403
Sure.

1086
01:05:53,163 --> 01:05:55,163
Thanks Tim. See you tomorrow.

1087
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,300
Do you know the story of "Six hikers?

1088
01:06:25,499 --> 01:06:27,132
No.

1089
01:06:27,133 --> 01:06:28,799
My father told me.

1090
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,800
At the spot where the Great
Lakes joins together...

1091
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,204
...they always find half a dozen of
drowned corpses floating in water.

1092
01:06:35,269 --> 01:06:38,466
Again and again, being seen by divers
and held as just a recent accident...

1093
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,599
...until they realize that the
clothes on them are from the Eighties.

1094
01:06:43,711 --> 01:06:45,711
Most of them are suicides.

1095
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,799
But that is scariest...

1096
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:52,320
...thing is that the current always brings them
to the same spot where they actually drowned.

1097
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,850
Just like they are looking
for redemption or justice.

1098
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,500
Therefore, fishermen calls
them "The six walkers."

1099
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,400
Understood.

1100
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,575
- Hey, can I?
- Yes.

1101
01:07:26,055 --> 01:07:28,055
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1102
01:07:39,966 --> 01:07:41,966
It's really nice here, right?

1103
01:07:44,301 --> 01:07:46,301
I never wanna leave this place.

1104
01:07:46,601 --> 01:07:48,601
Who said you would?

1105
01:07:50,409 --> 01:07:52,603
Yeah, right.

1106
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:56,133
After the final exams
first to enter university.

1107
01:07:57,122 --> 01:07:59,122
I don't even know which one.

1108
01:08:00,969 --> 01:08:02,935
I could pretty well imagine myself...

1109
01:08:02,936 --> 01:08:04,936
...having some normal job...

1110
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:09,277
...marrying nice woman,
having two-three kids...

1111
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,585
...and live in quiet neighbourhood
for the rest of my days.

1112
01:08:18,926 --> 01:08:21,707
- Do you think that's stupid?
- No, not at all.

1113
01:08:43,766 --> 01:08:46,099
Hey, turn the music down
and come here everybody.

1114
01:08:50,522 --> 01:08:52,522
Where is Marco?

1115
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,795
Marco!

1116
01:08:56,016 --> 01:08:58,016
Yes, come here!

1117
01:08:58,382 --> 01:09:00,382
Marco!

1118
01:09:00,674 --> 01:09:02,674
What is it?

1119
01:09:08,305 --> 01:09:12,931
Good! First of all, it's really
cool that you are all here.

1120
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Really great!

1121
01:09:15,615 --> 01:09:18,152
And second, as you all know,
we are playing a game against...

1122
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:22,088
..."bulls" from the Ernst
Barlach Comprehensive School.

1123
01:09:22,089 --> 01:09:23,644
All of you must come!

1124
01:09:23,645 --> 01:09:26,322
It would be really cool if all of
you come tomorrow and support us!

1125
01:09:26,391 --> 01:09:29,338
Also, tomorrow at 3 p.m.
at the swimming pool!

1126
01:09:29,592 --> 01:09:30,892
You are really great!

1127
01:09:30,893 --> 01:09:33,459
You must bring all of your friends,
and better they all wear white shirts!

1128
01:09:33,494 --> 01:09:34,399
Everybody!

1129
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,879
The enemy should feel
the power of The Wave!

1130
01:09:38,422 --> 01:09:40,422
Wave!

1131
01:11:32,901 --> 01:11:35,807
<i>Friday</i>

1132
01:12:01,975 --> 01:12:04,389
<i>What does this sign means?</i>

1133
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,750
Good morning, Mr Wenger.

1134
01:12:16,705 --> 01:12:18,599
Say, what is actually wrong with you?

1135
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,538
You can not simply
disappear for all night long.

1136
01:12:20,539 --> 01:12:22,766
Do you actually know what kind of
consequences I will need to face?

1137
01:12:26,766 --> 01:12:28,766
Shit!

1138
01:12:29,099 --> 01:12:31,099
That is one of these
anarchistic fuckers.

1139
01:12:31,315 --> 01:12:33,315
Are you now convinced that
you will be needing protection.

1140
01:12:33,943 --> 01:12:36,269
- Hey, you bum, what's up?
- Yeah, everything good.

1141
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,299
...we have them all.

1142
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,496
Good.

1143
01:12:42,497 --> 01:12:45,300
We all know who might be
responsible for this crap.

1144
01:12:46,866 --> 01:12:48,298
We don't have any evidence.

1145
01:12:48,299 --> 01:12:50,299
Marco, please.

1146
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,727
Marco...

1147
01:12:55,728 --> 01:12:57,728
...you also want The Wave
to keep going on, right?

1148
01:12:59,066 --> 01:13:01,066
Yes, I'm gonna talk to her...

1149
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:04,299
...but after the game, okay?

1150
01:13:05,533 --> 01:13:07,533
What are we supposed to
do with all these notes?

1151
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,700
Destroy them.

1152
01:13:16,365 --> 01:13:18,365
Everything OK?

1153
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,699
Have no clue who it was!

1154
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,399
I don't even want to know
how did you get up there...

1155
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,400
...but one thing is clear,
that was extremely dangerous!

1156
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:32,466
In the past I did some bad shit
myself, you can believe me on that.

1157
01:13:34,705 --> 01:13:36,705
But in this case,
this joke went too far!

1158
01:13:37,301 --> 01:13:39,708
- Is that clear?
- Yes, Mr Wenger.

1159
01:13:45,506 --> 01:13:47,506
Sit down!

1160
01:13:49,412 --> 01:13:52,966
I want you all to write down about
your experiences with The Wave.

1161
01:13:53,678 --> 01:13:55,750
And by the end of the class I
want to have them on my desk!

1162
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,601
Now go on, begin!

1163
01:14:29,912 --> 01:14:31,912
The time is up.

1164
01:14:38,868 --> 01:14:40,100
Later, Mr Wenger.

1165
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:45,149
Oh yes, incidentally, this does not mean that I'm not
going to be pleased seeing some of you during the game.

1166
01:14:45,555 --> 01:14:47,555
We will need your support.

1167
01:14:52,606 --> 01:14:56,375
Mr Wenger, I know who draw
graffiti on the City Hall.

1168
01:14:57,177 --> 01:14:59,738
Tim, have I asked you to give me the
names of those who are responsible?

1169
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,800
Actually I don't want
to know who it was...

1170
01:15:01,801 --> 01:15:04,716
...because if I knew, I would have to
inform School principle and the police.

1171
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Actually this is a collateral damage.

1172
01:15:07,755 --> 01:15:11,412
I hope that you had learned over this week that it
is better to work together and not against each other.

1173
01:15:12,141 --> 01:15:15,577
You especially, should be aware of
the fact that you can not fight alone.

1174
01:15:18,703 --> 01:15:20,703
I would be pleased if you
come to the game today.

1175
01:15:21,477 --> 01:15:23,477
Okay?

1176
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:26,750
Okay.

1177
01:16:00,488 --> 01:16:01,503
Come on!

1178
01:16:01,504 --> 01:16:03,504
Yes, now play forward!

1179
01:16:03,610 --> 01:16:05,610
Marco, go forward!
What are you doing?

1180
01:16:08,603 --> 01:16:10,890
Yes! Superb!

1181
01:16:16,891 --> 01:16:18,099
I can not let you in.

1182
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,099
What, why not?

1183
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:20,893
Get yourself a white shirt,
there are still some left outside.

1184
01:16:20,894 --> 01:16:22,894
I don't want your shitty Wave shirt!

1185
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,074
Everybody has one,
don't yell about it.

1186
01:16:25,075 --> 01:16:27,075
You are loosing your mind.

1187
01:16:27,178 --> 01:16:29,178
We have the right side blocked.

1188
01:16:29,656 --> 01:16:31,656
You guys are really missing
some screws in your heads.

1189
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,600
Defence, get closer!

1190
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:52,700
Go, forward now! Forward!

1191
01:17:01,869 --> 01:17:04,447
Yes! Very good, very good.

1192
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:07,448
- And, what do you say now?
- Shut you mouth, dude!

1193
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,600
No mistakes now!

1194
01:17:11,577 --> 01:17:13,577
What do we do now?

1195
01:17:14,188 --> 01:17:16,188
I won't stop so easily.

1196
01:17:22,712 --> 01:17:24,712
Fall back now a bit,
you are in the lead!

1197
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,800
Go, Go! Faster! Go, Faster!

1198
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:53,755
Fuck off, man!

1199
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,500
You bastard!

1200
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,100
Okay?

1201
01:18:15,011 --> 01:18:18,051
Stop the Wave!

1202
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:20,940
Stop the Wave!

1203
01:18:31,479 --> 01:18:33,479
We knew it!

1204
01:18:33,557 --> 01:18:35,557
Go, get all that flayers!
Everybody come here!

1205
01:18:59,799 --> 01:19:01,799
Why? What happened?

1206
01:19:12,569 --> 01:19:14,569
Are you crazy, or what?

1207
01:19:16,733 --> 01:19:18,733
Say, are you out of your mind?

1208
01:19:19,466 --> 01:19:21,466
What are you doing?

1209
01:19:21,873 --> 01:19:23,873
Sinan, what got into you?

1210
01:19:31,035 --> 01:19:33,035
Believe me, I... ...I
don't believe this.

1211
01:19:33,933 --> 01:19:36,058
Now you have brought the trouble here!

1212
01:19:36,233 --> 01:19:38,520
But I have not told them that they
should punch their opponents in the face!

1213
01:19:38,633 --> 01:19:40,808
But of course not, you are not
capable of doing that, right.

1214
01:19:41,061 --> 01:19:42,132
What are you trying to say to me?

1215
01:19:42,133 --> 01:19:45,171
You are enjoying that they think of you like of some
god at the class, they hang on every word of yours.

1216
01:19:45,533 --> 01:19:46,932
What are you saying?

1217
01:19:46,933 --> 01:19:50,316
Don't tell me that you don't like the fact that they do hang on
your every word as your students, who do you think who you are?

1218
01:19:50,433 --> 01:19:51,865
You completely missed the point!

1219
01:19:51,866 --> 01:19:54,592
The students see you as an example and
you manipulate them for your own cause!

1220
01:19:54,933 --> 01:19:57,700
There is only your ego trip,
don't you actually realize that?

1221
01:19:57,833 --> 01:19:59,732
Do you know what I believe, I
believe you are just damn jealous.

1222
01:19:59,733 --> 01:20:00,332
What?

1223
01:20:00,333 --> 01:20:03,697
Yes, jealous, because they don't see you as
example, despite your prestigious diplomas.

1224
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:06,133
Yes, now this narrow-minded pedagogy will
show you how the things should be done.

1225
01:20:06,477 --> 01:20:08,477
Oh, narrow-minded, THAT is the problem.

1226
01:20:08,533 --> 01:20:10,472
Yes, that's what you think of me!

1227
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:14,233
Graduated two times, diplomas in sports
and Political Science, what is it good for?

1228
01:20:14,448 --> 01:20:16,132
I did not know that the
problem lies so deep.

1229
01:20:16,133 --> 01:20:18,133
Oh you didn't know that the
problem lies so deep, right?

1230
01:20:18,336 --> 01:20:23,502
At least I don't have to take antidepressants every
morning because I have fucking fear of going to school!

1231
01:20:35,555 --> 01:20:38,206
Anke... Anke, wait.

1232
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:42,349
- I did not mean that.
- You did.

1233
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:44,156
You said, and you meant it!

1234
01:20:44,157 --> 01:20:47,480
For the last few days you
are really such an asshole.

1235
01:20:47,481 --> 01:20:49,481
Just leave me alone!

1236
01:20:56,682 --> 01:20:58,132
Karo, wait for me!

1237
01:20:58,133 --> 01:20:59,052
What was that earlier...

1238
01:20:59,053 --> 01:21:00,998
...have you gone crazy, or what?

1239
01:21:00,999 --> 01:21:02,150
You can not do that?

1240
01:21:02,151 --> 01:21:03,865
Who do you think you are?
Are you drunk, or what?

1241
01:21:03,866 --> 01:21:07,008
You better ask yourself, what is actually going on
with you? What happened today in the swimming pool?

1242
01:21:07,299 --> 01:21:09,154
It was full for the first time.

1243
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:10,132
And the brawl?

1244
01:21:10,133 --> 01:21:12,083
That happened only
because of this shit here!

1245
01:21:12,084 --> 01:21:13,532
You really don't
understand anything, do you?

1246
01:21:13,533 --> 01:21:15,638
We would have win if you
had not mess up everything.

1247
01:21:16,542 --> 01:21:18,259
And that has annoyed you, right?

1248
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:20,260
It would have been my
show for the first time.

1249
01:21:20,883 --> 01:21:22,234
Idiot.

1250
01:21:22,235 --> 01:21:23,862
- Karo!
- Leave me alone!

1251
01:21:23,863 --> 01:21:25,863
...do wait!

1252
01:21:35,783 --> 01:21:37,783
Do not touch me.

1253
01:21:38,444 --> 01:21:40,444
- Do not touch me!
- Karo.

1254
01:21:42,634 --> 01:21:44,634
Go away!

1255
01:22:25,469 --> 01:22:27,469
Marco, what are you doing here?

1256
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:30,610
I'm in a deep shit.

1257
01:22:30,611 --> 01:22:32,611
Come in.

1258
01:22:36,686 --> 01:22:38,686
What's happening?

1259
01:22:40,408 --> 01:22:41,898
I...

1260
01:22:41,899 --> 01:22:43,899
I've hit Karo.

1261
01:22:44,022 --> 01:22:46,022
You did what?

1262
01:22:46,344 --> 01:22:47,754
I've beaten Karo.

1263
01:22:47,755 --> 01:22:49,755
Why?

1264
01:22:51,799 --> 01:22:53,799
I do really don't know.

1265
01:22:54,444 --> 01:22:56,444
We had an argue because...

1266
01:22:57,359 --> 01:22:59,657
This whole shit has totally changed me!

1267
01:23:01,135 --> 01:23:02,434
I love Karo!

1268
01:23:02,435 --> 01:23:04,435
And I've beaten her anyway.

1269
01:23:04,933 --> 01:23:07,908
This pseudo-discipline,
this is all Fascist shit!

1270
01:23:08,533 --> 01:23:10,533
You have to quit.

1271
01:23:11,269 --> 01:23:13,269
Rainer.

1272
01:23:16,151 --> 01:23:17,991
I have to think about it.

1273
01:23:17,992 --> 01:23:19,727
You have to quit.

1274
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:22,333
- Immediately!
- Don't tell me what should I do.

1275
01:23:36,735 --> 01:23:39,143
Yes, I... I know, Mrs. Kohlhage.

1276
01:23:39,537 --> 01:23:41,444
I know, I know, yes.

1277
01:23:41,445 --> 01:23:43,445
I don't want just to make
bad things look better.

1278
01:23:44,404 --> 01:23:46,404
Yes, I do accept full responsibility.

1279
01:23:46,534 --> 01:23:48,295
But I must talk once
again with my students.

1280
01:23:48,296 --> 01:23:50,988
Only thing I am asking for is
to have a little trust in me.

1281
01:24:05,992 --> 01:24:07,732
<i>Hey guys, just arrived.</i>

1282
01:24:07,733 --> 01:24:09,332
<i>Tomorrow, School hall, 12 o'clock.</i>

1283
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:10,999
<i>It is about the future of The Wave.</i>

1284
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,433
<i>Send this only to
members and sympathisers.</i>

1285
01:24:13,559 --> 01:24:15,559
Three exclamation marks?

1286
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,841
<i>Saturday</i>

1287
01:25:12,734 --> 01:25:14,939
Mr Wenger, it's quarter past twelve.

1288
01:25:16,092 --> 01:25:18,305
Then lock the doors, I
don't want to be disturbed.

1289
01:25:18,531 --> 01:25:20,433
OK.

1290
01:25:20,434 --> 01:25:23,729
Is it okay, if I stand in front
of you while you're speaking?

1291
01:25:24,308 --> 01:25:26,208
Then I have better overview of the hall.

1292
01:25:26,209 --> 01:25:28,209
I don't mind.

1293
01:25:35,036 --> 01:25:37,036
If everything is fine with you?

1294
01:25:39,833 --> 01:25:41,266
Okay, then lock the entrance.

1295
01:25:41,267 --> 01:25:44,133
Mr Wenger wishes not to be disturbed
during his speech, you got it?

1296
01:25:45,435 --> 01:25:47,435
Everybody get in now,
we are about to start!

1297
01:26:15,539 --> 01:26:19,333
<i>Actually, I always had everything
that I wanted, clothes, money etc...</i>

1298
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:21,648
<i>...but what I had the
most was a boredom.</i>

1299
01:26:21,789 --> 01:26:23,032
These are my words.

1300
01:26:23,033 --> 01:26:25,033
<i>But the last few days
have been real fun.</i>

1301
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:30,617
<i>It is no longer about who the most
beautiful or the best or the most successful.</i>

1302
01:26:31,234 --> 01:26:33,234
<i>The Wave has made us all equal.</i>

1303
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:38,833
<i>Race, religion and social
status plays no role anymore.</i>

1304
01:26:39,704 --> 01:26:41,704
<i>We all belong to one movement.</i>

1305
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:43,905
<i>The Wave gives us new meaning.</i>

1306
01:26:43,936 --> 01:26:46,160
<i>Ideals for which it
is worth to stand up.</i>

1307
01:26:46,858 --> 01:26:48,688
<i>I had bullied other students before.</i>

1308
01:26:48,689 --> 01:26:51,506
<i>If I really think back about
myself, it was really retarded of me.</i>

1309
01:26:51,908 --> 01:26:54,307
<i>It is much better to
stand up for a noble cause.</i>

1310
01:26:55,339 --> 01:26:58,633
<i>When you can lean on somebody
else, you can achieve so much more.</i>

1311
01:26:59,009 --> 01:27:01,072
<i>I am ready step back
from my bad behaviour.</i>

1312
01:27:06,133 --> 01:27:08,017
As you probably all noticed...

1313
01:27:08,018 --> 01:27:11,957
...these are all excerpts from your essays
on the experience from the last week.

1314
01:27:12,635 --> 01:27:14,699
I am very impressed with what
The Wave had brought to you.

1315
01:27:15,091 --> 01:27:18,039
And that's why I also believe
this project should not simply end.

1316
01:27:22,233 --> 01:27:24,807
- Rainer, what it this shit?
- Marco, do sit.

1317
01:27:24,808 --> 01:27:26,832
Yes but... Man, people think...

1318
01:27:26,983 --> 01:27:28,983
I've told you to sit down!

1319
01:27:31,871 --> 01:27:33,871
For several years the
Germany is going downhill!

1320
01:27:34,283 --> 01:27:36,283
We are the losers from globalization...

1321
01:27:36,433 --> 01:27:38,997
...but the politics tries to prove,
that struggling more and more...

1322
01:27:39,436 --> 01:27:41,436
...is the only way out of crisis.

1323
01:27:41,473 --> 01:27:43,761
But politicians are
puppets of the economy!

1324
01:27:44,434 --> 01:27:46,432
The unemployment rate should fall!

1325
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:48,533
We are also world champion in exports!

1326
01:27:48,966 --> 01:27:50,932
But in reality...

1327
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:53,712
...the poor are getting poorer
and the rich are getting richer!

1328
01:27:56,713 --> 01:27:58,803
Once the major threat was the terrorism.

1329
01:27:59,555 --> 01:28:05,188
A terror that we have created ourselves, by
allowing unfairness in the rest of the world!

1330
01:28:06,033 --> 01:28:09,138
And while we are slowly but
surely ruining our planet...

1331
01:28:10,033 --> 01:28:12,522
...some super-rich people sit
somewhere and rub their hands.

1332
01:28:13,033 --> 01:28:16,633
Building space capsules for themselves to be
able to see the whole thing from high above!

1333
01:28:19,434 --> 01:28:21,434
Don't you all understand his intentions?

1334
01:28:21,535 --> 01:28:23,364
He wants to manipulate you all!

1335
01:28:23,365 --> 01:28:24,743
Its enough, sit down.

1336
01:28:24,744 --> 01:28:27,033
You will not stop me from
telling the truth, Marco.

1337
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:29,333
The Wave is the real problem!

1338
01:28:30,533 --> 01:28:34,833
No, The Wave is the only way that
that is able to make things better!

1339
01:28:35,249 --> 01:28:37,249
Because together we
can make thing happen!

1340
01:28:38,635 --> 01:28:40,635
We!

1341
01:28:41,488 --> 01:28:45,055
Today we have a chance
here to write the history!

1342
01:28:49,259 --> 01:28:52,888
Your girlfriend had turned you
against us. That is your problem.

1343
01:28:52,933 --> 01:28:54,933
- It is not true.
- Of course it's true!

1344
01:28:55,055 --> 01:28:57,237
She had completely
infected you with her shit.

1345
01:28:57,266 --> 01:28:58,932
You will not stop us!

1346
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:01,497
From in here, The Wave should
reach the whole Germany!

1347
01:29:05,936 --> 01:29:07,936
And those who cross its path...

1348
01:29:07,952 --> 01:29:09,952
...will be washed away!

1349
01:29:11,236 --> 01:29:13,236
Exactly.

1350
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:17,333
Bring forward the traitor!

1351
01:29:32,936 --> 01:29:35,633
Marco, Now I ask you in
front of everybody here:

1352
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,834
Are you with us or against us?

1353
01:29:38,945 --> 01:29:40,945
Have you all completely
lost your mind, or what?

1354
01:29:41,530 --> 01:29:43,530
What should we do with the traitor?

1355
01:29:44,658 --> 01:29:46,658
What to do with traitor?

1356
01:29:49,238 --> 01:29:51,033
Bomber, you decide!

1357
01:29:51,034 --> 01:29:53,034
Come on, speak!

1358
01:29:54,858 --> 01:29:56,858
You have brought him up here.

1359
01:29:58,632 --> 01:30:00,532
Yeah, because you said so.

1360
01:30:00,533 --> 01:30:02,707
Yes, because I said, right?

1361
01:30:04,488 --> 01:30:06,488
And would you kill him, if I say so?

1362
01:30:08,341 --> 01:30:11,056
We can also hang or decapitate him!

1363
01:30:12,533 --> 01:30:14,628
Or maybe torture him until...

1364
01:30:14,933 --> 01:30:16,933
...he is committed to our rules!

1365
01:30:18,135 --> 01:30:20,135
That are the usual things
they do in a dictatorship.

1366
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:29,121
Have you noticed what
had just happened here?

1367
01:30:31,133 --> 01:30:33,743
- Everything okay, Marco?
Yes, everything fine.

1368
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:39,732
Can you remember...

1369
01:30:39,733 --> 01:30:41,921
...what question was floating
in the air since the last week?

1370
01:30:42,733 --> 01:30:44,902
Whether it was still possible
to have a dictatorship back here.

1371
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:50,039
That was exactly that, fascism.

1372
01:30:53,321 --> 01:30:55,292
We all have taught we
are better than that.

1373
01:30:55,293 --> 01:30:57,293
Better than all the others.

1374
01:30:57,633 --> 01:30:59,633
And what is even worse...

1375
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:03,332
...we have excluded from our community
all of these that didn't share our opinion.

1376
01:31:05,292 --> 01:31:07,292
We had them hurt.

1377
01:31:09,232 --> 01:31:11,232
I don't even want to know what
else would have we been capable of.

1378
01:31:16,534 --> 01:31:18,534
I must apologize to all of you.

1379
01:31:19,435 --> 01:31:21,435
We went too far.

1380
01:31:25,099 --> 01:31:27,099
I went too far.

1381
01:31:29,863 --> 01:31:31,863
The things will come to the end here.

1382
01:31:32,455 --> 01:31:34,964
And what does that mean
now... ...for The Wave?

1383
01:31:35,899 --> 01:31:37,899
That it is over.

1384
01:31:38,189 --> 01:31:39,932
Just like that?

1385
01:31:39,933 --> 01:31:41,933
Yes, just like that.

1386
01:31:42,432 --> 01:31:44,137
No, it is not over.

1387
01:31:44,138 --> 01:31:46,138
Yes Tim, it is over.

1388
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:48,159
But not everything in The Wave is bad!

1389
01:31:49,152 --> 01:31:50,946
We all felt that.

1390
01:31:50,947 --> 01:31:53,232
Yes, we made some mistakes,
but nothing we can not correct!

1391
01:31:53,699 --> 01:31:55,232
No Dennis...

1392
01:31:55,233 --> 01:31:57,233
...some things you can not correct.

1393
01:31:59,443 --> 01:32:01,443
I want you all to go home now.

1394
01:32:02,148 --> 01:32:04,261
There are certainly things
that you should think about.

1395
01:32:22,534 --> 01:32:24,534
- Maja, I...
- Leave me alone.

1396
01:32:27,535 --> 01:32:29,230
Stop!

1397
01:32:29,231 --> 01:32:31,262
All remain at your seat
and leave the doors!

1398
01:32:31,933 --> 01:32:33,933
Nobody goes home!

1399
01:32:39,432 --> 01:32:41,705
- Put the gun away.
- You have lied to us.

1400
01:32:44,535 --> 01:32:47,149
The Wave lives, it is not dead!

1401
01:32:48,731 --> 01:32:51,876
Everybody say: "The Wave lives!

1402
01:32:52,888 --> 01:32:54,888
That is only a gas-gun.

1403
01:33:03,455 --> 01:33:05,311
Yes...

1404
01:33:05,312 --> 01:33:07,238
Now you take me seriously!

1405
01:33:07,239 --> 01:33:09,239
Do you think that I don't know
that you had always picked on me.

1406
01:33:11,433 --> 01:33:13,433
And you all had fucked with me.

1407
01:33:18,999 --> 01:33:20,999
The Wave...

1408
01:33:21,266 --> 01:33:23,266
...it was my life.

1409
01:33:28,687 --> 01:33:31,423
Tim, calm down.

1410
01:33:33,634 --> 01:33:35,634
Calm down.

1411
01:33:35,635 --> 01:33:37,635
Put the gun away.

1412
01:33:40,451 --> 01:33:43,299
Another step further and I
will shoot you in the face.

1413
01:33:44,637 --> 01:33:46,637
And then?

1414
01:33:47,485 --> 01:33:49,403
What then?

1415
01:33:49,404 --> 01:33:52,488
Then, there is no more Mr
Wenger, who can lead your Wave.

1416
01:33:54,410 --> 01:33:56,410
Is that what you want?

1417
