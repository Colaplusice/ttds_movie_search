6
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:44,300
Despite possible coincidences,
this film is fictional.

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,610
Rio de Janeiro
present time

8
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,225
We'll wait behind the hospital.

9
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,060
Tell us when he comes out, ok?

10
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,235
He's going to the parking lot.

11
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,988
Attention. He's coming out.

12
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,038
This may look like an
American movie cliche

13
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,124
but it's when facing death
that we understand life.

14
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,668
I beat up a lot of junkies.

15
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,587
I took down many crooked cops.

16
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,589
I sent a ton of
thugs into a ditch.

17
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,508
But it was nothing personal.

18
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,053
Society prepared me for this.

19
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:44,097
And a mission assigned, my friend,
is a mission accomplished.

20
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:52,951
Elite Squad 2: the Enemy Within

21
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,970
Special Ops. (BOPE)

22
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,137
You'll never be one of us!

23
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,983
Talk, talk! Who's the killer?
Tell me!

24
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,416
- Tell me you want out!
- No, sir!

25
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,667
If not, you're out!

26
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,714
...that I'm about to have a son.

27
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,273
She has two kids!

28
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,035
I tried to save my family...

29
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,703
I left a guy I trusted
in my place.

30
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,039
Didn't work out,
and I came back.

31
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,583
I was with BOPE many years.

32
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,252
I commanded the unit.
Fought until the end.

33
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,589
I'd still be with BOPE,
if not for what happened...

34
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,175
at the Penitentiary Larcio
da Costa Pellegrino...

35
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,635
better known as "Bangu One".

36
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:47,513
(Bangu One, 4 years earlier)

37
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,639
- Big Curi.
- Hey! How you doing?

38
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,477
- All good?
- Quiet.

39
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,644
Enough work there?

40
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,484
This is where the drug lords
ended up...

41
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,610
Hey, partner.

42
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,112
...the guys that the police
caught and didn't execute...

43
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,073
because they had a lot
dough to lose.

44
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,657
- All good here?
- All good.

45
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,621
Each drug gang was put
in its own isolated wing.

46
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,458
If left to mix,
these punks would kill each other.

47
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,676
You know what they did inside?

48
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,678
The same as outside.

49
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,974
They were at war, vying for
control of trafficking in the city.

50
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,951
If up to me, I'd lock them up,
throw away the key...

51
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,161
and let them slaughter
each other inside.

52
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,540
But there are liberal
intellectuals...

53
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,542
who make a living
defending these punks.

54
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,337
What's worse is that they get
into the heads of many people.

55
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:06,133
...the craziest thing we've been
discussing is that prison today...

56
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,009
is a place that costs enormously...

57
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,721
only to make people worse.

58
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,141
And look what more and more...

59
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,017
Fraga lived to call me
a fascist

60
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,270
but didn't have the courage
to tell it to my face.

61
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,356
When we spoke face to face,
he pretended to respect me.

62
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,609
And the fucked-up thing is
I had to do the same.

63
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,029
...Just to give you an idea,
in 1996...

64
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,325
the Brazilian prison population
was 148,000 prisoners.

65
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,996
Today, 10 years later,
the prison population...

66
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,999
is over 400,000 prisoners.

67
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,419
It's more than double.
It's almost triple.

68
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,299
I made a calculation.
It's perverse, I have it here.

69
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,342
Obviously, doesn't make sense.

70
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,220
Picture this, a history professor
doing math. What a disaster.

71
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,141
But this one I must make sure
to share with you...

72
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,351
which is that I noticed...

73
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,438
that the Brazilian
prison population...

74
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,025
doubles, on average,
every 8 years.

75
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,945
While the Brazilian population...

76
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,073
doubles every 50 years.

77
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:17,204
If we continue this way,
in 2081...

78
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:24,044
the Brazilian population will be
570 million...

79
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,172
in other words, your kids,
grandkids, and great-grandkids,

80
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:31,218
while the Brazilian prison
population...

81
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,764
will be 510 million.

82
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:42,229
Your children, grand-children,
and great-grandchildren!

83
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:46,900
In other words, 90% of Brazilians
will be in prison.

84
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,445
Can you picture it? Huh, Jlia?

85
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,906
Is this the retirement
you had in mind?

86
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,160
But listen, don't worry,
don't worry...

87
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,329
because this situation here
gets better.

88
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:04,000
In 2083, all Brazilians
will be living here.

89
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,754
In a gated community
like this one here.

90
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,422
Bangu One,

91
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,259
our first maximum
security prison.

92
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,135
- What's up, Curi.
- Hey, how's it going?

93
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,471
I'm gonna fix a
problem with Beirada...

94
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,390
- but it's all good, ok?
- That's cool, partner.

95
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,016
Here inside,
ladies and gentlemen...

96
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:23,144
are the 40 guys
considered the most dangerous...

97
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,479
in Rio de Janeiro. 40!

98
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,023
Ali Baba is outside.
He's at the palace.

99
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,693
But the 40 are inside,
guaranteed.

100
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,405
Waddup.

101
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,574
Yo, Curi.
What you got for us?

102
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,075
What's up, Beirada.

103
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,413
Here, as we agreed...

104
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,042
- Gimme.
- Here are the pieces.

105
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,920
Here, hold this.

106
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,422
All good, right?

107
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,591
Yo, I'm checking
it's all here.

108
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,592
Tie him there.

109
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,304
If you pay attention,
Bangu One will remind you

110
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,306
of reality today in our city.

111
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,976
Rio de Janeiro today
is, let's put it this way,...

112
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,730
divided into 3 criminal factions
in constant conflict...

113
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,649
and Bangu One is exactly
the same thing ...

114
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,734
- Tie him there.

115
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,321
3 criminal factions feeding
the hatred...

116
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,197
and rivalry among them.

117
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,326
Goddamn it, Beirada,
what the fuck?

118
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,078
"What the fuck" is a shitload.
Shut up, shut your mouth.

119
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,622
You're getting a shitload of dough.

120
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,208
Real quiet. Kids,
quiet, ok. Quiet.

121
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,339
A miserable bunch...

122
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,341
who never had a chance
at education...

123
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,218
who never had any chance
in life...

124
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,140
locked and forgotten in the worst
conditions imaginable...

125
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,352
and controlled by police...

126
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,562
with strong tendencies toward
corruption.

127
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,482
Beirada is out.

128
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,984
Notify the authorities
Bangu One's blowing up.

129
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,904
Oh, and bring me coffee.
Hard bread sucks.

130
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,509
- It's Qual that I want!
- Easy, easy!

131
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,387
Out of the way, move, move, move.
Move, goddamn it.

132
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,055
Sit down!

133
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,390
So you were gonna kill me?

134
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,558
You gonna die.
You gonna get it in the ass.

135
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,936
- I'm just a soldier, yo.
- That's the fucker.

136
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,521
- I'm just a soldier.
- He's the boss.

137
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,273
Yet, some folks still
open their mouths to say...

138
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,025
Brazil's the
country of inpunity.

139
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,570
It may even be, for one
particular sector of society.

140
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,408
Because for the others,
for the working classes...

141
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,494
for mere mortals,
there's hell to pay.

142
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,080
Put this shit in.
Put him in the oven.

143
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,167
- Come on!
- Go to hell, cocksucker.

144
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,335
The guy's gonna die!

145
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,297
Hey, man, you fattened the pig,
now we're gonna roast it!

146
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,426
There, get the mattress there.
Bring it, bring it.

147
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,226
Go in, go in. Rap, soak him.

148
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,104
- Our time, boss.
- Soak him. Now you'll...

149
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,230
Our time.
Bath time.

150
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,441
...learn how to roast pork,
motherfuckers.

151
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,443
- Bath!
- Soak him.

152
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,243
Now let's go to the Third.

153
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,328
Let's get that motherfucker
over there.

154
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,082
You're surrounded.
You can't escape.

155
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,584
Sons of bitches.

156
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,961
- Red assholes.
- I'm going to shoot.

157
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,880
Pieces of shit.

158
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,632
Whoever fears death,
homes, shouldn't be born. Got it?!

159
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,134
We're at war!

160
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,889
- Open this shit there, son.
- Let's fucking go!

161
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,145
What, bro?
Go fuck yourself, son!

162
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,481
I don't negotiate with police.
Go to hell.

163
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,357
If you come in, everyone will die.

164
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,902
Negotiate my cock!

165
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,029
Call Fraga,
call Fraga...

166
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,697
I don't negotiate with police.

167
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,282
Open this shit, kid.

168
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,121
I asked you to turn off
your phones and I left mine on.

169
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,707
Just a moment.
Real quick.

170
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,420
It's guys like Fraga who thugs
need when they start shit.

171
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,588
Right now?

172
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,304
And the shit that Beirada started
changed Fraga's story...

173
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,934
and Rio's story...

174
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,519
and my story.

175
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,146
The punks set fire to Qual.

176
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,732
He's on fire, but everyone's
in the main hall already.

177
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,609
- Can you hear me?
- Affirmative.

178
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,321
From here, I think it's
one long and two short.

179
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,406
I think it's a twelve-gauge
and two pistols.

180
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,952
The guards are tied to the bars,
close to you there.

181
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,954
They want to break thru.
What door is that?

182
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,957
- Third Command.
- Zoom in on that door.

183
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,087
The guys want to enter
the wing of the Third.

184
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,089
They want to kill everyone there too.

185
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,299
They want in,
we'll let 'em in.

186
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,759
We'll let them in.

187
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,637
Andr, get the squad
in position...

188
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,556
but do nothing until
I give the order, understood?

189
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,349
We're gonna let these guys
go in there.

190
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,185
- Understood? Do you copy?
- Affirmative, Colonel.

191
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,330
Zero One, in position.

192
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,709
- Show me the squad.
- Monitor 4, Colonel.

193
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,005
Confirm...

194
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,216
Andr, confirm it's a twelve-gauge
in that punk's hand.

195
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,890
Where's the Third?
I wanna go into the fucking Third.

196
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,894
Affirmative, Colonel.
Do you copy?

197
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,605
Copy.

198
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:08,740
Commander, we have a
good opportunity here.

199
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,284
Nascimento, one minute...

200
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,619
I need authorization
from the Governor.

201
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,913
Just a minute. Pardon me.

202
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,248
The Red Commandoes killed
the heads of ADA.

203
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,418
Nascimento wants authorization
to enter and finish the job.

204
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,170
Could be a good idea, Governor.

205
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,504
It solves the problem completely.

206
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,547
The public will support it.

207
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,174
Nobody tolerates these
assholes anymore.

208
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,051
No. I don't want
another "Carandiru."

209
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,929
- Where's the guy from human rights?
- I already sent him.

210
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,931
He should be there soon.

211
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,058
Tell Nascimento to buy some time.

212
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,271
Does the Governor realize
the opportunity...

213
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,940
we have right here, Commander?

214
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,777
- And you'll let this guy go in?
- The man's here, Colonel.

215
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,989
He's already here.

216
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:54,410
Open this shit now.
I want the fucking Third, man!

217
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,080
Sup, bro? Wassup?

218
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,666
Nascimento, let's deal
with this problem and...

219
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,417
- not make it personal. Cool?
- Cool, Fraga.

220
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,544
Unfortunately I cannot
authorize your entry.

221
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,463
If I don't go in,
there'll be a bloodbath.

222
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,756
- It's already started.
- I know.

223
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,007
- It's already started.
- I know, I know.

224
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,176
I don't want to pull
your body from there.

225
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,678
Colonel, you have to understand...

226
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,972
my entry's already been
authorized by your boss.

227
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,348
I'm going in.

228
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,225
Fraga!

229
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,603
- The vest, Renan.
- No need.

230
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,106
- No need. I won't use it.
- Wear the vest, Fraga.

231
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,233
If I go in with a vest, Colonel...

232
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,442
they won't trust me.

233
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,574
Andr, Che Guevara here is
going in without a vest.

234
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,333
Beirada, what the hell is this?

235
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,501
What's going on here?

236
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,920
This fuck isn't coming close?

237
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,925
He's right in front of you,
Andr. Can you hear me?

238
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,343
With all due respect...

239
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,594
- Affirmative.
- With all due respect...

240
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,388
we're solving our own problem,
understand?

241
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,931
Solving your problem?
This way?!

242
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,349
Beirada has a pistol in his hand.

243
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,476
We gotta do what we gotta do,
you feel me, Fraga?

244
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,270
- Let me tell you something...
- With all due respect.

245
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,939
BOPE is outside and is coming
to kill everyone.

246
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,774
Fuck 'em! We'll kill all
these fuckers here.

247
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,359
They're not even here for
these people.

248
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,529
Think! BOPE doesn't give a
shit about these guys.

249
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,365
They haven't come in yet
because I'm fucking here.

250
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,035
He's doing well.
Hold, stay calm.

251
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,537
If I leave, you're fucked.
Release these guys.

252
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,372
- You guarantee?
- I guarantee. Let them go.

253
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,999
- You guarantee, Fraga?
- Do it, Beirada.

254
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,001
- Man to man.
- I'll stay. Let them go.

255
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,377
Think, damn it.

256
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,547
Let these guys go so I can come
in and talk with you. Do it.

257
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,426
Do it. Let them go.

258
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,767
- Let these guys go, Beirada.
- You guarantee, Fraga?

259
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,019
If I leave, you're fucked.

260
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,563
Let's end this
as quickly as possible.

261
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,987
Let them go and
let's get this over with.

262
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,281
Enough damn killings.
Let's end this.

263
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,326
- Do it. Let them go.
- Paulinho, let these guys go.

264
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,452
- Let them go.
- Ok.

265
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,288
Let them fucking go.

266
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,957
He's untying the hostages, Andr.
He's untied one.

267
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,085
The man's in control of
the situation, Andr.

268
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,045
Hold. Stay put.

269
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,217
He opened the door. Ok?

270
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,968
He opened the door,
he's letting them go.

271
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,429
One's out, two's out,
Fraga went in.

272
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,181
Easy, he's in charge, Andr.

273
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,310
Stop, Andr! Stop, Andr!
Fuck.

274
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,445
Don't shoot, damn it!
Don't shoot!

275
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,197
- He's gonna die, son.
- Lower your gun, Beirada.

276
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,198
Lower my gun, fuck that.

277
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,449
Lower your gun,
he won't shoot.

278
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,076
- He will, bro.
- Do you hear, Captain?

279
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,037
- Let the hostage go.
- He won't shoot anymore. It's over.

280
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,623
No one will shoot anymore,
do you hear, Captain?

281
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,754
- Lower your gun, Beirada.
- Lower my gun, my ass.

282
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,464
- Shit.
- No more shooting, Captain!

283
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,467
Lower your gun. Lower your gun
coz it's over. It's over, Beirada.

284
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,345
- Listen, Beirada, it's over.
- Let him go.

285
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,139
- You can trust me.
- It's a trick, son.

286
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,099
Trust me, Beirada. It's over.
Lower the damn gun.

287
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,977
Lower your gun,
trust me. Lower it.

288
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,481
Matias seized his chance.

289
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,484
He did as trained in BOPE.

290
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,112
He killed the punk to
protect the hostage.

291
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,115
The problem, my friend,
is that a .762 bullet makes...

292
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,658
a small entry hole...

293
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,495
but the exit hole is
the size of a tangerine.

294
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,126
The team entered and in
less than a minute...

295
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,502
we had the problem resolved.

296
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,421
Matias eliminated
the toughest guy...

297
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,007
- in the history of Red Commandoes.
- Hands on your head!

298
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,384
There was just one detail
that spoiled everything.

299
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,053
That fucking T-shirt.

300
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,764
"Human Rights" written
in English and covered in blood...

301
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,017
That shit turned into
headlines the world over.

302
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,936
A massacre, total carnage,
that's what happened inside.

303
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,939
The Governor will have to explain how,
after he promised me...

304
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,942
that there would be no massacre,
immediately after...

305
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,195
Colonel Nascimento
and Captain Matias...

306
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,447
executed the prisoners
in cold blood.

307
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,574
Because it was an execution.
It was an execution.

308
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,951
Give us more details.
Was there a negotiation?

309
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,286
No. No time for negotiation.

310
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,206
The bullets from Captain Matias, on
orders from Colonel Nascimento...

311
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,332
got there first.

312
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:13,127
BOPE entered only and exclusively
to kill and they killed.

313
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,547
In fact, they did what they're used to
doing in the slums of Rio.

314
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,592
Ethnic cleansing.
Social cleansing.

315
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,428
That's what they do.
And that's what they're paid for.

316
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,430
To be cowards.

317
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,974
BOPE today were cowards
in that prison...

318
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,101
just as they are cowards
in our community.

319
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,699
I'd like, just one time,

320
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,578
to see BOPE invade
and arrest a drug dealer...

321
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,996
in a luxury condo.

322
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,998
But it's not what they do, right,

323
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,708
Mr. Secretary of Public Security?

324
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:56,379
There, the Skulls don't go in,
do they, Mr. Chief of Police?

325
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,506
So you think that BOPE
acted with excessive force?

326
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,091
Is this what doomed
the operation?

327
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,219
What we can't admit is that
a representative of the State...

328
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,264
is more violent than those
that we want...

329
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,599
in prison for violent crimes.

330
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,978
It's absurd.
This is becoming routine.

331
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,356
This is becoming normal.
And no one thinks it's odd?

332
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,401
To have a police force
whose symbol is a skull?

333
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,112
To have a police force
whose symbol is death?

334
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,156
I find this inexplicable.
Mr. Governor.

335
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,288
I'm perplexed.

336
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,498
Sir, you will have to give
an explanation.

337
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,042
And it won't do to say that
Colonel Nascimento...

338
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,627
ignored your orders.

339
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,255
Yes, Colonel Nascimento
was a coward.

340
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,049
Yes, he led the entire massacre.

341
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,677
But the one who orders
the police is the Governor.

342
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,429
It's all his responsibility.

343
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,223
Fuck, I did everything to save
Fraga and the guy bashed me.

344
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,519
I never butted into Rosane's life
after we separated.

345
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,771
But marrying him was a low blow.

346
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,191
The guy went around filling
my son's head with bullshit.

347
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,331
It's best you don't come in.
Did you read the paper today?

348
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:19,086
So why isn't Formoso here
talking to me now?

349
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,424
Why can't I talk to Formoso?

350
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,717
So when...

351
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,303
So when he comes to talk to us...

352
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,556
we'll speak to the press, Pinheiro.
Cheers.

353
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,976
Commander, the decision to
go in was mine.

354
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,686
I'm the one who killed.

355
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,563
Let me take responsibility alone.

356
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,106
The responsibility is mine, Andr.

357
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,110
The responsibility is mine.
I'm in command.

358
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,570
Colonel, you'll excuse me...

359
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:48,366
but if we're gonna go down,
better to go down shooting.

360
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,701
Our unit is being thrown
to the dogs.

361
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,120
Let's call the press
and let the shit hit the fan.

362
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,455
Let's fuck these bastards, sir.

363
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,623
Andr, you heard what I said?

364
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,708
You heard my conversation
with Pinheiro just now?

365
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:01,128
- Were you listening? You heard?
- Yes, sir.

366
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,465
So you want to fight
with the Governor? Now?

367
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,468
In the press? You want to fuck
the Battalion over?

368
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,721
You don't want this.

369
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,475
Lupe, did you find
the Commander-General?

370
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,976
No, he went to lunch.

371
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,020
Then find out where
and let me know.

372
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,147
These guys are afraid
to talk to me.

373
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,650
I'm not afraid
to talk to them.

374
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,486
After the accusations from
the representative...

375
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,489
of Human Rights AID that
reverberated around world...

376
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,284
Guanabara Palace said
that they will relieve from duty...

377
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:36,122
the BOPE officers involved in the
occupation of the Bangu One prison.

378
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,373
True.
But if not Otavio...

379
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,541
who will you put, Guaracy?

380
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,043
Who it'll be, or who it
won't be, matters little.

381
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:44,422
The Governor wants that son a bitch
Nascimento discharged tomorrow.

382
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,506
- Ok.
- End of story.

383
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,924
Let's resolve this quickly.

384
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,176
We'll quickly put,
promote the subcommander?

385
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,261
- Renan?
- Quickly.

386
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,387
- Good idea.
- Yeah. Renan.

387
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,140
Later we'll see who to put
in his place and done.

388
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,307
True.

389
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,518
Oh shit.
Don't look now...

390
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,311
but that asshole
is coming in right now.

391
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,272
- Who?
- Fucking Nascimento. Look.

392
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,357
The Governor needed a scapegoat.

393
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,776
He put Beirada's death on me.

394
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:09,530
But for the public, my friend,
a good thug is a dead thug.

395
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,289
Well done.

396
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,543
Go talk to him.
Go hug him.

397
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,211
Go talk to him.
Go talk to him.

398
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,548
Colonel! Welcome.

399
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,092
What a pleasant surprise.

400
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,677
Welcome.

401
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,319
Now I'd like to ask for a
little of your attention...

402
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,489
gentlemen,
and your attention ladies.

403
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,575
Queixada, close in.

404
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,411
Open up, Imperador.

405
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:01,457
Governor of this wonderful
state...

406
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,251
of Rio de Janeiro,
pay attention.

407
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,467
Do you know what this is, Governor?

408
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,594
Big steps.

409
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,472
It's what's happening
to our city...

410
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:20,267
which is taking big steps
toward barbarism.

411
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,481
Governor, do not discharge
Colonel Nascimento of duty.

412
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:29,610
Because if you do,
it'll stink.

413
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:34,281
Stink with a capital S.

414
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,160
Because you would be giving
the green light...

415
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:42,456
for them to return to the streets,
prowl the bars...

416
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:46,418
the plazas, the schools, offering
drugs to our sons...

417
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,295
to our daughters.

418
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:55,553
Governor, you would
be turning our city...

419
00:25:56,388 --> 00:26:00,933
into an enormous pool of blood.

420
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,937
Is this what you want?

421
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,649
To transform our city...

422
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,069
into an enormous pool of blood?

423
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,654
No!

424
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,907
Don't do that.

425
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,411
Do this right now.

426
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:24,498
Close in, Queixada.
Close in, Imperador.

427
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,210
"Dagger in the Skull"...

428
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,505
and strike these thugs.

429
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,216
Release the steel.
Finger on the trigger.

430
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,927
The man's show has a
a rating of almost 30 points.

431
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,597
They get tons of letters
from the audience.

432
00:26:40,657 --> 00:26:42,558
- The tide will turn, Governor.
- Now I'm a fan...

433
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,684
I know what I'm doing.

434
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,978
- of Colonel Nascimento...
- Nascimento is out of BOPE.

435
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,314
my wife is a fan,
even my dog Diana...

436
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,108
is a fan of
Colonel Nascimento.

437
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,487
Don't transform our city
into a pool of blood.

438
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,450
Combat trafficking now.

439
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,109
And that's how Fraga toppled
me from the command of BOPE.

440
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,738
Only, I didn't fall down,
my friend.

441
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:41,283
- I fell up.
- Good morning, Mr. Subsecretary.

442
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:44,286
I'm Valmir Magalhes,
coordinator here of SSI.

443
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,165
The Secretary asked me to
welcome you. Please.

444
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,417
If voters were saying
that I was a hero...

445
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,586
who was the Governor
to say otherwise?

446
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:55,047
Renata, please send me
the report.

447
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,012
If you'll be so kind...

448
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,433
in a while, we'll need to
record your fingerprints.

449
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,560
The first day I was almost lost.

450
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,604
- Hell, I never had a computer before.
- The room.

451
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,150
How could I be
Subsecretary of Intelligence?

452
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,319
How could I be responsible...

453
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,071
for all the wiretaps of
Rio de Janeiro?

454
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,324
- This is all wiretapping?
- That's Monitoring.

455
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,452
You can see we have
cameras there...

456
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,705
we have access to all
the cameras in the city.

457
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,333
This is the Watchdog,
where we log...

458
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,544
all phone interceptions.

459
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,587
It would be difficult...

460
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,048
but I had landed where
no Skull had ever been.

461
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,468
In the Secretariat of Security,
I wouldn't be fighting only drugs.

462
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,929
I'd be able to fight the system.

463
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,473
Commander, this Skull
will fuck up our scheme...

464
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,474
in our unit, goddamn it.

465
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,351
Put him in an operation,
let him take a shot...

466
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,477
friendly fire and done...

467
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,229
- bury him with military honors.
- Captain.

468
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,440
You have been very well
commended in this battalion...

469
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,649
but I'm in command,
goddamn it.

470
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,067
You're gonna fuck up
our scheme.

471
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,444
- Fuck our scheme.
- This is fucked.

472
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,653
- This is fucked.
- What, Mrio?

473
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,071
What the fuck is "this"?

474
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,492
I'm telling you. We can't lay
a finger on a Skull, goddamn it.

475
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,495
It's an order. He's my friend.

476
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,873
He saved my life one time.

477
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,083
I'll put him in a corner
out of the way.

478
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,210
Forget this fucking shit.

479
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:19,256
Fuck up my battalion here.
Tell the Captain to enter.

480
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,508
Then it's on you, ok, Commander.

481
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,386
It seemed all was going
to end well.

482
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,972
But things were beginning
to crumble.

483
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,016
The Governor, who wasn't
an idiot at all...

484
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,684
decided to please the left.

485
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,688
Someone had to pay for the blood
on the shirt of human rights.

486
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,900
Permission to present myself,
Colonel.

487
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,110
What a pleasure, trainee.

488
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,113
The mere thought of Matias
wearing that blue uniform...

489
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,281
gave me hives.

490
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,658
Mr. Secretary, I'd like
if you could intercede...

491
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,660
with the Governor
in relation to the situation...

492
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,287
of Captain Andr Matias.

493
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,541
It's not fair for him
to be in that unit.

494
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,128
Matias is one of the best
cops we have.

495
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:03,133
It's not right for him to be there,
it's not correct, it's not fair.

496
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:07,429
I was in command of the
operation at Bangu, Mr. Secretary.

497
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,183
I'd like you to take this...

498
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,143
as a personal request from me.

499
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,689
Well, Colonel, I think your
position is commendable.

500
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,441
I think your request is fair.

501
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,278
I will speak to the Governor,
touch on this subject.

502
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,155
I'm sure he will understand.

503
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,659
Matias, I knew that Nascimento
was an asshole, partner.

504
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,661
He thinks he's got the biggest cock.

505
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,039
But betrayal, I didn't expect that.
That's bullshit.

506
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,334
The guy there in the government
and you expelled from BOPE?

507
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,212
- Son of a bitch.
- Fbio, don't meddle in this shit...

508
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,755
- It's not your business.
- What's wrong?

509
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,340
- Don't meddle.
- Relax, Matias.

510
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,341
Stay out of this.

511
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,592
I'll make you relax.

512
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,970
I'll put you where you can relax.

513
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,764
Trust me! You're going
to relax big time, partner.

514
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,608
- This is where you'll be.
- Fucking hell, Fbio.

515
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,735
Central Archives. It's important!

516
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,738
Organize this shit for me, ok?

517
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:10,325
I tried to help Matias, but
he couldn't stand the humiliation.

518
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,620
He called Clara Vidal, the most
controversial journalist in the city...

519
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,247
May I record what you're saying?

520
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,082
You may. I'll repeat.

521
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,750
...and let the shit hit the fan.

522
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,378
It's cowardly for the Governor...

523
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,214
to blame me for the prison deaths.

524
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,134
BOPE has been abandoned
for long time.

525
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,971
Cops go into the streets to
kill thugs every day.

526
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,764
I can't accept this cowardice.

527
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,517
Especially from a government
that only thinks about politics...

528
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,227
and only thinks of themselves.

529
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,148
The Governor was furious
and Matias was completely fucked.

530
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,025
On top of being in a unit
of corrupt cops...

531
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,110
he got 30 days in jail.

532
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,654
May I come in?

533
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,753
How can I get you
out of here, Andr?

534
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,424
"BOPE Officer
Blames Governor"

535
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,302
What are you trying to
accomplish by stirring shit up?

536
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,929
- I don't get it.
- Stirring shit, Colonel?

537
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,681
You mean, telling the truth,
defending the Battalion...

538
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,016
is stirring shit up?

539
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,142
Watch your tone with me.

540
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,560
- I was telling the truth.
- Show respect!

541
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,561
Watch your tone with me.

542
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,022
Don't talk to me about
defending the Battalion.

543
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,197
You defend the Battalion
doing what I taught you.

544
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,282
Not giving interviews
to papers.

545
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,166
You're in jail, Andr.

546
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,711
You'll defend what from here?
You're in jail, old friend.

547
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,217
If there's anyone here...

548
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,177
here in this room who can
defend the Battalion...

549
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,595
excuse me, but it's not you.

550
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,472
I can defend the Battalion
from the SSI.

551
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,598
- I can do...
- Colonel...

552
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,725
for the unit what no one
has ever done for the unit.

553
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,935
- Colonel...
- I can.

554
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,938
Colonel, with all due respect,

555
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,484
these sons of bitches
that you're mingling with...

556
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,486
only care about politics.

557
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,991
The only thing that'll change
with you inside the Secretariat...

558
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,994
is yourself.

559
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,623
Unless you've already changed, huh?

560
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,930
- Good evening. How are you?
- Good evening.

561
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,350
To make things worse, Fraga
turned his 15 minutes of fame...

562
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,935
into a candidacy
for state representative.

563
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:42,978
...campaign proposals...

564
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,104
what I'd like you...

565
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,981
Of course, all the intellectuals
on the left...

566
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,358
and all the potheads
would vote for him.

567
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,652
Hi, how are you? Some
proposals from my campaign.

568
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,654
I don't want you
stuck in front of him.

569
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,531
I want you circling.
Circling.

570
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,782
Don't stop in front of him.

571
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,660
This armchair Che Guevara
already pissed me off...

572
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,121
as NGO head,
imagine what he'd do...

573
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,123
if he held public office.

574
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,541
It would be fucked up.

575
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,377
And my family would be
caught in the crossfire.

576
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,796
Grab the kimono with
both hands, Rafa!

577
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,257
The kimono with both hands, Rafa!

578
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,385
I won't deny it,
I like fighting.

579
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,388
For me, only those who can
fight can live in peace.

580
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,185
I only wanted to teach
this to my son...

581
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,437
without worrying about
the opinion of others.

582
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,355
Come on, Rafa. Come on, come on!

583
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,442
Sit up! Good, good, good.

584
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,028
Good, Rafa. Good, Rafa.

585
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,954
Good. Good.

586
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,040
Watch the sweep,
the sweep.

587
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,348
All good. All good.

588
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,975
You know the only thing
I didn't like?

589
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:07,062
Your hand loose.
You have to grab here...

590
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,564
Both hands on the kimono,
No hand loose.

591
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,567
- I didn't want to fight.
- Didn't want to fight?

592
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,028
You pestered me all month
long to come fight.

593
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,571
Why didn't you want
to fight, son?

594
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,573
We're here, let's fight
to win now.

595
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,242
We won't lose.
Fight to win.

596
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,036
I'm not like you,
beating people up.

597
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,929
How are you?

598
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,434
Have you calmed down?

599
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,940
Beto, the problem isn't what
Rafa does or doesn't hear.

600
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,150
It's what you do.

601
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,193
The man tells my son
I'm a murderer...

602
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,195
- and the problem is what I do?
- He didn't.

603
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,030
He spoke on TV
and Rafa heard.

604
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,949
Ah, right. On TV, he can?
On TV, it's ok?

605
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,450
Did he lie?

606
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,661
I'm a cop, Rosane.

607
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,121
I'm not, I'm not...
A coffee.

608
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,497
I'm not gonna argue
this with you.

609
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,249
A coffee, please.

610
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,293
I'm not gonna argue with
you either...

611
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,086
the definition of murderer.

612
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,214
I just won't hide the
truth from my son.

613
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,966
If you don't want
to lose Rafa...

614
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,509
- That's what you think?
- speak to...

615
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,263
That's what you think I am, now?

616
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,724
Doesn't matter what I think.

617
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,018
If you want to be
close with Rafa...

618
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,477
you'll have to tell him the truth.

619
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,479
I won't lie to my son.

620
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,648
You'll have to find
a way to explain to him...

621
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,275
what you do for a living, Beto.

622
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,285
Battalion. Attention!

623
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,288
Battalion. At ease!

624
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,957
My son was afraid of me...

625
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,251
...Rosane considered me
a fascist...

626
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,420
...Matias considered me
a traitor.

627
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,256
I should have been
depressed, my friend.

628
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,508
But I wasn't.

629
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,427
My mission was more important...

630
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,054
than my personal problems.

631
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,307
Gentlemen, BOPE is a
fundamental part...

632
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,185
of our mandate of
public security.

633
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:16,316
I have total confidence
in your abilities.

634
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:19,986
- Together always.
- Skulls!

635
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,739
I dove into my work, my friend.

636
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,991
I exorcized my demons...

637
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,494
in Rio's Secretariat of
Public Security

638
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,079
Skulls!

639
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,749
Go and defeat.
Know no defeat.

640
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,962
- Special Ops!
- Bravo, well done.

641
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,004
Bravo!

642
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,048
I did what I told Matias I'd do.

643
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,509
I turned BOPE
into a war machine.

644
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,053
With me in the Secretariat
of Security...

645
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,097
BOPE got up to 390 officers...

646
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,765
and 16 tactical teams.

647
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,559
Before, we had 8 cars.

648
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,397
Now, we had armored cars
and a helicopter.

649
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,200
For some, war is cure.

650
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,370
War acts as an escape valve.

651
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:14,207
When pressure mounts at home,
vent it on the streets.

652
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,626
With me, it was always like that.

653
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,075
There! Hit there.

654
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,217
Pinheiro, can you hear me?

655
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,387
Concentrate fire at the top,
they're gonna come down.

656
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,390
Look there. Keep it there.

657
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,644
Let's go!
Let's go!

658
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,397
You can go in, Pinheiro.
Send everyone up.

659
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,274
Do you copy, Pinheiro?

660
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,276
After I arrived at the
Secretariat of Security...

661
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,570
the thugs no longer had peace.

662
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,947
The war machine I helped set up...

663
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,283
busted trafficking in Rio.

664
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,160
It was only a matter of time.

665
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,997
With trafficking out of the game,
the corruption spree would end.

666
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,708
Finally, I would fuck up the system.

667
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,424
In theory, my plan had
everything to succeed.

668
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,177
The less pot and cocaine consumed...

669
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,929
the less return from trafficking.

670
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,264
Hey, Marcinho, what you got
for us, son?

671
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,308
Hey listen. We ain't got
nothing for you.

672
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,684
Ah, don't give me that, Marcinho.

673
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,436
I came here, bro, you
gotta lay some eggs.

674
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,479
...your buddies killed...

675
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,023
If the dealers broke,
the dirty cops would break too.

676
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,024
Sup, buddy?

677
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,984
We're choking, can't
sell nothing, Rocha.

678
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:05,693
Marcinho.

679
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,320
Come on, buddy,
let go the loot, son.

680
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,614
Listen, we only got
500 bones from cable TV.

681
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,658
You make me come up here
for 500 fucking bones?

682
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,201
- Beat it, son.
- Shut up, pothead.

683
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,953
- Go fuck yourself.
- Go fuck yourself, bro.

684
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,204
Come on, Rocha.

685
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,498
Give my hood a break, man.

686
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,499
Don't sweat.

687
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,168
When the scratch is light,
my friend, the love is gone.

688
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,714
Let's go, Santos.
Check it out, Gonalves.

689
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,050
Yay, there's already 20 here.

690
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,219
Check the wallet, check
his backpack too.

691
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,388
Take the watch. Good.
Leave them there.

692
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,975
Without their cut from drugs, the
crooks wouldn't get along anymore.

693
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,977
Damn, took Marcinho out?

694
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,271
You want to fuck me.

695
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,523
30 per week? What is that?

696
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,067
Wanna fuck the unit over?
Wanna fuck me out of my command?

697
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:50,989
Colonel, every dog licks
his own dick.

698
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,699
And another thing...

699
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,993
Who said you're in command?

700
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,037
- Commander, your subordinate...
- Fbio!

701
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,081
...challenging me,
disrespecting me...

702
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,332
- ordering around...
- Easy, Fbio.

703
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,293
I'll hold him 30 days,
then run him over.

704
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,253
Captain Rocha is key
to the administration.

705
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,754
But he's demoralizing me.

706
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,048
I have to satisfy
a lot of interests, Fbio.

707
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,216
I'm in command, Formoso!

708
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,386
Colonel, what do you want?
You want another post?

709
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,305
You want to switch unit?

710
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,390
I'll switch you.
But you'll be fucked, ok.

711
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,477
A suggestion.

712
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,228
You won the lottery, Fbio.

713
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,063
Don't throw it away.

714
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,609
With all due respect,
listen to me.

715
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,444
Dismissed, Colonel Fbio.

716
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,280
And I was gonna kill two birds
with one stone.

717
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,740
Son of a bitch.

718
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,242
That would have been the
first step in the clean-up...

719
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,036
of the Military Police of Rio.

720
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,122
Except, in practice,
everything went wrong.

721
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,753
The guys are coming up there.

722
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,505
These guys, fuck.
What, faggot?

723
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,589
Don't start with that.

724
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,550
What actually happened was
not what I had planned

725
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,219
What you got for us, son?

726
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,054
Here's the deal, bro.

727
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,306
I only have 500 Reals to
give you, Rocha.

728
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,433
Where's this dough coming from
if you can't sell?

729
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,976
- You're selling your ass now?
- Fuck that!

730
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,561
That shit's from cable TV,
Rocha.

731
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,604
That shit ain't from drugs, bro.

732
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,897
From cable TV?
Talk to me!

733
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,608
This shit here, each resident's
gotta give us 12 Reals.

734
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,276
Got it? That's nothing.

735
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,278
Just so that each resident
can have a TV at home.

736
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:16,074
Yep, nothing like an economic
crisis to trigger innovation.

737
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,743
It only took the loss of drug bribes
for the crooked cops...

738
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,495
to see the obvious.

739
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,372
Each poor neighborhood in Rio...

740
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,582
is much more than
a place to sell drugs.

741
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,167
Come on, Rocha.

742
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,503
Give my hood a break, man.

743
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,754
Don't sweat.

744
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,923
Who said this is your hood?

745
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,136
Rocha realized,
by eliminating the middleman...

746
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,305
the system grossed more.

747
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:42,100
It was obvious.
It was simple math.

748
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,477
Hey, Irineu? Selling
many subscriptions?

749
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,312
Hey, boss. Soon, there
won't be enough poles!

750
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,939
No. We'll arrange poles.
Just continue.

751
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,108
Slum folks like cable TV.

752
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,693
Hey, Valdir.

753
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,486
Slum folks drink water.

754
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,697
Slum folks get online.

755
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,116
People connecting?
...Damn!

756
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,118
Everyone's plugged in!
Here, Santos.

757
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,120
Slum folks cook with gas.

758
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:05,915
Pops, I'm confiscating this.
I'm gonna leave it there.

759
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:10,086
You'll go down the slope,
take the first left.

760
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:13,339
Go to Danilo Baiano, there
you'll buy gas.

761
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,674
Hurry, it's closing.

762
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,175
- Slum folks take out loans.
- Go, pops!

763
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,137
We're not like just any
bankers, Mrs. Severina.

764
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,639
We're fair. But here,
you have to pay.

765
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,890
- I know.
- You have to pay.

766
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,393
Aranha, I'm outta here, ok.
I zeroed the register.

767
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,145
- No worries.
- Ready?

768
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,479
I just need your name...

769
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,897
Every slum is
a huge market...

770
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,691
of purchases and sales.

771
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,403
Rocha figured out it was better
to tax the whole slum...

772
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,405
than a bunch of fucked-up
drug dealers.

773
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:41,326
Each time money changed hands,
Rocha took a tax.

774
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,578
The crooks' own Robin Hood tax.

775
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,414
Motherfuckers robbin' the hood.

776
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:49,667
Pretext? To defend the
hood from trafficking.

777
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,170
The truth was quite different.

778
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,547
This fucking van doesn't
make much, dude.

779
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,673
Barely enough for one, man.

780
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,508
How can I split with you, Rocha?

781
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,969
You won't split?
I'll give you a break.

782
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,263
It's 90% for us and
10% for you, ok?

783
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,724
What? Are you crazy, dude?
I have a family to feed.

784
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,267
10% ain't enough for anyone!

785
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,436
Marreco, take over this shit.

786
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,022
Beat this bitch,
Marreco, fuck him up!

787
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,398
- Bring him here.
- Fuck him up!

788
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,941
Leave him to me.

789
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,610
You don't wanna pay the tax,
huh, bitch?!

790
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,111
Good.

791
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,405
My turn.

792
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,577
- Let's take a walk!
- Let's take a walk, yeah. Yeah!

793
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,704
Santos, Santos.

794
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,290
Shake him well to jiggle his head.

795
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,250
You gotta pay the tax, kid.

796
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,711
Fuck him up.

797
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,644
Whereas Fbio pulled in
30,000 every month...

798
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,188
Rocha pulled in 300,000,
tax-free.

799
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,612
In 4 years, the system
took over almost all...

800
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,614
the West Side of Rio.

801
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,493
In the past, we invaded and
the dealers came back.

802
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,996
But when the dirty cops
started occupying the slums...

803
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,249
the dealers didn't come back.

804
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:17,338
For a while, I thought the
system was helping BOPE.

805
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:21,217
But really, it was BOPE
helping the system.

806
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,014
Yeah, I helped create the monster
that was going to devour me.

807
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:30,268
(Present time)

808
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,688
What's worse is that only
one person realized this...

809
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,649
Representative Diogo Fraga.

810
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:40,361
You know what I found
about homicides...

811
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,696
in the areas of the militia?

812
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,449
Many witnesses started dying.

813
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,243
It was Rocha's gang.
They killed my brother.

814
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,495
More than 20 shots,
in front of everyone.

815
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:52,665
And before dying, these same
witnesses gave new statements.

816
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,251
- Then who was it?
- Who it was, I don't know, ma'am.

817
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,086
I know who didn't do it.
It wasn't Rocha.

818
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,213
You can put that down.
It wasn't Rocha.

819
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,675
Wherever there's militia,
there's profit and death...

820
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,304
fostered by public agents
in charge of security.

821
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,559
In practice, the militia is the
mafia.

822
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,520
You pay them to protect
you from them.

823
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,493
With the growth of militias...

824
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,703
Fraga found another cause...

825
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,413
in the name of human rights.

826
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,666
And like all good politicians,
he exploited it to the fullest.

827
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,628
Because, on top of the violence
that you can see here...

828
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,880
they talk as if they're legitimate.

829
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,091
Of protection, of self-defense
against trafficking...

830
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,927
but, in reality, they want control.

831
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,429
Damn! That's a lot of bullets,
huh, Fraga.

832
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:52,350
Yeah. What we're dealing with
is the mafia, Mr. President.

833
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,602
Because that's what it is.
The militia is the mafia.

834
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,646
True organized crime.

835
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,898
Permission to speak,
Representative, President.

836
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,691
You may speak,
Representative.

837
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,069
Fraga, for the love of God.

838
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,197
You're talking about the mafia,
son? Nonsense.

839
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:09,450
The mafia are Italians who
love pasta, rondelli, gnocchi.

840
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,203
- Rep. Fortunato, I...
- We love rice and beans.

841
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:15,373
I'm a huge fan of your sense
of humor, you know that.

842
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,166
But I think it fits better
on your show.

843
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,377
In Italy there's no trafficking,
you know that.

844
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,462
- No trafficking?!
- This is hood self-protection.

845
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,381
Yes, but folks are dying
in these hoods.

846
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,132
- Hood self-protection.
- Self-protection?

847
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,425
That's what you call it?

848
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,927
Pay them to protect from them.

849
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,345
- Go there, see if...
- I go there!

850
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,930
You have any idea
how many people...

851
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,473
die in these neighborhoods?

852
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,933
- They're protecting themselves.
- Any idea?

853
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,644
- Decorum! Decorum, please!
- Forgive me, Mr. President.

854
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,938
Listen. Let me tell you
something, Fraga.

855
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:42,108
We're in an election year.
Everyone's in campaign mode.

856
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,985
- You have your own campaign.
- Election year?

857
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,444
It's like any other year for me.

858
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,446
- What! Don't say that.
- You know very well that...

859
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,448
a CPI inquiry in an election year...

860
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,993
- turns into campaigning.
- No, Mr. President...

861
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,078
I just think that this matter
is more important...

862
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,000
than whatever election year.
That's my position.

863
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,375
Look, Fraga, I'm not saying
you're wrong...

864
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,960
nor that he's right.

865
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,963
What I'm saying is this:
in an election year...

866
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,382
I will not accept your CPI.

867
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,634
Clear your head,
think about something else...

868
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,679
Fraga's strategy was to fight
the government head-on.

869
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,182
He loved provoking us to
see what came out in the media.

870
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,602
Fraga wanted to be a federal
representative...

871
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,688
and a CPI would be his
ticket to the capital, Brasilia.

872
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,483
But 4 years later,
everyone still believed...

873
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,694
that my plan had worked.

874
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,530
Guaracy was cashing in from
my blows on trafficking.

875
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,948
Good morning, Mr. Governor.
Good morning.

876
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,158
It was so successful...

877
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,993
that he ditched the
Secretariat of Security...

878
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,453
and left to be a federal
congressman.

879
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,371
- How are you? Good?
- I already went ahead.

880
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,123
The Governor in the center,
please.

881
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,500
Vermont, I'm not convinced
about this tie. Yellow?

882
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,460
- It's great!
- Gold.

883
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,961
- Yellow's nice, Governor.
- It's nice.

884
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,213
Even the Governor was
reaping the fruits of my labor.

885
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:49,008
His reelection was guaranteed.

886
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,553
The problem was, the more
votes Guaracy won...

887
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,305
the more Fraga criticized me.

888
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,307
And the more he criticized me...

889
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,559
the more my son distanced
himself from me.

890
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,981
Rafael, if you want a ride,
I'm leaving.

891
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,983
Ok.

892
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,196
This is for Fraga.

893
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,243
- Fraga.
- Thanks, kid.

894
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:19,038
Julia is leaving now.
Can I go with her?

895
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,457
- Of course. You can go.
- Thanks.

896
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,417
Thanks for today.

897
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,421
Ready to go?

898
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,298
Let's go.

899
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:35,304
Yeah, my friend, just when
things couldn't get worse.

900
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:38,265
After Fraga became state
representative...

901
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,726
I couldn't even look
him in the face.

902
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,103
Here it is, Representative.

903
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:45,523
She just needs to sign this
document...

904
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:50,069
appear in court and that's all.

905
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,488
Understood. Here, Julia.

906
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,534
Read carefully,
don't rush, then sign.

907
00:49:57,452 --> 00:50:00,454
- Barata, how's it going?
- Colonel, how are you?

908
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,289
- Good.
- What happened here?

909
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,042
- Nothing, it's all resolved.
- Can I see the statement?

910
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,335
- Of course.
- Beto...?

911
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,295
I was going to tell you.

912
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,463
Can I read?
He's my son.

913
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,007
Rafa had nothing to do with this.

914
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,037
Can we remain civil?

915
00:50:12,068 --> 00:50:14,552
Tell him not to talk to me.

916
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,637
Calm down, calm down.

917
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,101
100 grams, Barata?

918
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,312
You were buying for the
entire office, miss?

919
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,939
A moral lecture, now?

920
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,233
Barata, look,
my son is 16.

921
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,652
Nowadays, that's
corruption of minors.

922
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:35,573
And 100 grams, nowadays,
that's drug trafficking.

923
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,574
Beto, stop it.

924
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,743
I said, don't talk to me.

925
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,161
- Folks, please.
- I told you...

926
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,788
to shut your mouth and
not speak to me.

927
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:46,292
- Shut your mouth!
- Dad!

928
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,960
The pot was mine.

929
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,629
You can put that down, sir,
the pot was mine.

930
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,056
His father is right.

931
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,974
100 grams of pot
is no joke.

932
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,601
Hey, you shouldn't have
taken the blame.

933
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,937
Yeah? And let her get arrested?
Because of your argument?

934
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,148
That has nothing to do
with it, Rafael.

935
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,983
By the way, you
have to fire her.

936
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,026
Why would I fire her?

937
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,027
For exposing Rafa.

938
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,528
She took responsibility,
didn't she?

939
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,363
Rafa is right. If there's
a problem here...

940
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,448
it's not her.

941
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,783
Ok, if you don't...

942
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,117
Rafa won't work there
anymore.

943
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,660
That's what he wants.
Exactly what he wants.

944
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,370
He wants us to fight,
to push Rafa rom me.

945
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,371
That's exactly it.

946
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,623
You think this was normal?

947
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,665
No, not normal, Rosane.

948
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,375
Just like it wasn't normal
how he acted.

949
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,710
He was deciding the kid's life.

950
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,171
He didn't decide. He arrived
at the station...

951
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,964
and his son was there with
100 grams of pot.

952
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:35,341
Right in front of us.

953
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,218
He wants what's best
for his son.

954
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,427
At no time did he ask us...

955
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,012
I'm tired.
I lost my appetite.

956
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,972
You're acting just like my father.

957
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,481
Of course, I didn't want
to hear what Fraga...

958
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,191
was saying about the militias.

959
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,151
It was hard separating things.

960
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,154
That's why I couldn't see
what was happening...

961
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,989
in Rio.

962
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,575
The system was changing, evolving.

963
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,412
Before, politicians used
the system to make money.

964
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:09,041
Now they depended on the
system to get elected.

965
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,168
You understand?

966
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,420
The sports center is
already open...

967
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,047
the kids are playing sports.

968
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,632
The renovation of the
public square...

969
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,134
is on its way,
trash collection...

970
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,718
You know you have our support.

971
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,679
The Governor is here
so I can't lie.

972
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,391
You can be sure that
one of our priorities...

973
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,018
- is the support of the community.
- Governor, speechless.

974
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,229
Sincerely. Just a moment.
Just a moment.

975
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,064
Just a moment, godfather.

976
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,275
Paquito, take a picture,
Paquito, damn it.

977
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,235
You're too slow.

978
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:52,543
Relax, folks, today
it's in celebration.

979
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,963
It's in celebration.

980
00:52:56,423 --> 00:53:00,050
I'd like to thank you all in
the community for being here.

981
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,469
We're very happy for you.

982
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:07,099
But I coudn't begin this
without honoring..

983
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,518
3 people very important to us.

984
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,230
First, the honorable
Governor Gelino...

985
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:16,192
up for reelection.
Thank you, Governor.

986
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,112
You will be reelected here
by the community.

987
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,239
You can count on that.

988
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,283
Thank you, Governor.

989
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,204
I'd also like to note
the presence of...

990
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,581
the Secretary of Public Security
in Rio, Guaracy.

991
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,708
Thank you, Guaracy.

992
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,338
Guaracy who is now a fed.

993
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,131
Thanks to us as well.

994
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:43,969
And our eternal godfather,
Representative Fortunato.

995
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,138
Thank you, Representative.

996
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,350
- I'm your fan.
- We're with you.

997
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,310
- Thank you, thank you.
- We're with you.

998
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,103
A blessing.

999
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:56,732
Today is a celebration
of 4 years...

1000
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,444
of our Community Center
of Rio das Rochas!

1001
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,280
It's all ours!

1002
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:06,283
Let's do some samba now
and tear this shit up.

1003
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,543
Waddup. Yeah, baby.

1004
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,045
Beautiful.

1005
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,507
Oh, lovely.

1006
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:29,181
"A new leader is born
in the hills of the flagpole."

1007
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,641
Remember what I told you before?

1008
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,269
In the slums, cash flows,
deals are closed...

1009
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,312
and the system levies a tax?

1010
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,524
Well, yeah, but I skipped
one thing, my friend.

1011
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,360
In Brazil, elections are business...

1012
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:45,197
and votes are the most valuable
commodity in the slums.

1013
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,617
Didn't take long for Guaracy,
Fortunato, and Gelino...

1014
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:52,037
to realize the militia expanded
the Governor's constituency.

1015
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:56,667
The more slums the militia controlled,
the more votes they got.

1016
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,004
Hey, Fbio? You like the boat?

1017
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,922
Fuck, you gotta appreciate
me more, Rocha.

1018
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:04,341
- I'm at the front lines.
- Shit, you got balls.

1019
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,926
You're already bitching?
Hey, Santos.

1020
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:08,345
- Why you bitching?
- Shit, Fbio, listen...

1021
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,139
I didn't bring you here for this.

1022
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,348
Here's the deal.

1023
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:14,226
We're taking the whole West Side,
Tanque will be ours.

1024
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,269
You're gonna help me.

1025
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,895
Fuck, bro, that's
gonna be a bitch.

1026
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:19,106
There's more guns there
than in my unit.

1027
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,191
- Just a moment.
- Fbio, take it easy, man.

1028
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,610
Something's happening right now
that'll change our lives.

1029
00:55:24,089 --> 00:55:28,089
(Police Station, Tanque area)

1030
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,906
Go, go!
Come on!

1031
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:31,618
- Don't fuck with me!
- Why you looking at me?

1032
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,163
- On the ground.
- Let's go.

1033
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,539
- Come on!
- Come on, goddamn it.

1034
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,667
- Game over.
- I'm gonna fuck you up!

1035
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:41,337
- Face the wall.
- Wait!

1036
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:43,088
Easy, easy!

1037
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,632
Don't fuck around, so no one
gets hurt, all right?

1038
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,051
- Are you the Chief?
- Yes, sir.

1039
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,635
The key for the reserve arsenal!

1040
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,429
- Take it easy.
- The fucking key quickly!

1041
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,974
Face on the fucking floor.

1042
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,935
Here, the rifles are here.

1043
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,480
Hello. Yeah, Sem Alma.

1044
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,899
Good, son, good.

1045
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,443
Scratch them but
don't bury them, ok.

1046
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,112
Don't bury them, we'll need them.

1047
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,448
Thanks. Speak, Fbio.
What's your question?

1048
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,617
- Something I don't understand.
- Speak, damn it.

1049
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,118
We wanted the Skull
out of the way.

1050
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,079
We did, but not anymore.

1051
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,497
- Why not?
- To take Tanque...

1052
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,290
who am I gonna entrust?

1053
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,666
The crooks in your battalion?

1054
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:22,002
Are you fucking kidding me?

1055
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,671
He's such a joker, isn't he?

1056
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,674
Romance your woman,
Fbio.

1057
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:30,427
- Shit, relax.
- Shit, I'm annoyed.

1058
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,932
Militiamen are primitive
but not stupid.

1059
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:35,974
You love me.

1060
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:39,019
Tanque was the last stronghold
of trafficking on the West Side.

1061
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,979
Let's go, Mariguela.
Ready?

1062
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,941
Lots of money there
and lots of votes.

1063
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,151
But lots of guns too.

1064
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,362
Let's record, ok. Roll VT.

1065
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:52,282
Rolling, 4, 3...

1066
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,160
The militia could never take
Tanque alone.

1067
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,997
What's happening to
our city Rio de Janeiro?

1068
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:03,460
What's happening to
our wonderful city?

1069
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:09,675
Thugs come into a police
station and steal weapons.

1070
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:14,221
Weapons from inside
a police station!

1071
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,308
This isn't crime, no sir.

1072
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,269
This is terrorism!

1073
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:24,356
Don't talk to me
about human rights...

1074
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:27,192
because terrorists,
to me, aren't people.

1075
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:30,237
It's because of "blah, blah,
blah, human rights".

1076
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,531
Can't touch the thugs
Don't touch the thugs.

1077
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,199
Don't touch the thugs.

1078
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,493
Give candy to the thugs.

1079
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,371
Send roses to the thugs.

1080
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,707
This is a circus, man.

1081
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,002
Here, close in on me, Imperador.

1082
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,755
Governor...

1083
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:56,263
you know what this is?
This is a little dance.

1084
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,682
This is what will happen
to your administration.

1085
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:01,393
Your administration will dance
if you don't respond...

1086
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,354
because these thugs
will take these guns...

1087
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:07,357
to take on your government.

1088
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:10,527
We can't let that happen.
What is this, people?

1089
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,571
What is this?

1090
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:16,366
They want to fight
the administration...

1091
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:19,620
that best cleaned up this city...

1092
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,456
of narcotics trafficking.

1093
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,250
Governor...

1094
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:29,213
Destroy them!

1095
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:35,302
Secretary, I have to admit that
this asshole can speak.

1096
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,305
I agree, Governor...

1097
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:40,057
- I'm talking to Guaracy.
- He's right.

1098
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,267
If we play weak now,
we'll lose votes.

1099
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:43,560
We have to strike...

1100
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,437
to guarantee these elections.

1101
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:47,397
Listen, bystanders could
end up dead...

1102
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,441
- with this kind of operation.
- Excuse me.

1103
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,610
Governor, the campaign
materials are in.

1104
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,905
I decide these things, Formoso.

1105
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:55,906
Sure.

1106
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,908
Let's go see the campaign
materials.

1107
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:01,370
- Goddamn, I don't believe it.
- You like it?

1108
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,621
- Vermont...
- It's very good.

1109
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,581
- Very good.
- You've outdone yourself.

1110
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:06,333
- Great, isn't it?
- Don't you think?

1111
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:09,127
It looks like shit.
Look at this gold tie.

1112
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:10,629
I told you it wouldn't work.

1113
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,423
It won't connect with the
public. It's not popular.

1114
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:17,094
Look at Fortunato's tooth,
that broken tooth.

1115
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,346
This speaks to the people,
you understand?

1116
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,474
All the campaign material
must be redone, ok?

1117
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:23,350
- Redo it?
- Do it.

1118
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:26,395
Governor, we already owe
a ton of suppliers.

1119
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,273
You owe? Pay with this.

1120
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:32,568
You can't vote for an administration
that can't even protect a station.

1121
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:36,905
Either the Governor would respond
or the press would eat him alive.

1122
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:38,657
How many? You remember?

1123
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,617
And that's what the militia
was betting on.

1124
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,119
...or 8.

1125
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:45,372
7 or 8.
And they assaulted you?

1126
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,542
They came in here,
beat everyone.

1127
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,503
They cleaned everything out.

1128
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,548
Could you identify any
dealer from the area?

1129
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,179
Turn that off.

1130
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,143
It's off.

1131
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:10,147
What I'm about to tell you,
you didn't hear from me, ok?

1132
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,691
They weren't dealers at all.

1133
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,694
They came in with combat boots...

1134
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,904
Show us where the
reserve arsenal is.

1135
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:20,157
They referred to the
"reserve arsenal".

1136
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,159
That's not the
vocabulary of dealers.

1137
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,411
Cops? So it was the militia.

1138
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,121
He said that?
That it was the militia?

1139
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,205
No, he didn't say that.

1140
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,334
Because he was afraid
to say anything.

1141
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,919
But think about it,
the guy's Chief of Police...

1142
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,963
he heard them speak.
He understands, right?

1143
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,006
The language.

1144
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,674
Sure. Of course.
Yeah, it's possible.

1145
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,510
It's very possible, in fact.

1146
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:42,179
You know what I think
about the militia?

1147
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,972
I know. That's why
I came straight here.

1148
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:47,225
- Rafa! Do me a favor?
- Yeah?

1149
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,187
Bring a complete copy of
the file on the militias...

1150
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,938
to give to Clara, please.

1151
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,482
- Ok.
- Thanks.

1152
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,401
- You're giving me the militia file?
- This is very serious, Clara.

1153
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:58,111
- I know.
- What we're talking about...

1154
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:00,405
is the worst problem in Rio.

1155
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:03,033
It's the mafia.
Thanks, Rafa.

1156
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,203
I have no doubt that the
militia is involved.

1157
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:09,706
You have no idea what the
militia is capable of.

1158
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,959
Look, this is the file with
the main clues on all...

1159
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,002
we've been talking about.

1160
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,963
If you help me expose this...

1161
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,591
I'll serve the CPI.

1162
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,303
Take it, read it with care.

1163
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,639
I'll read it and speak to my
editor, all right?

1164
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,184
- Excuse me, Colonel.
- Close the door.

1165
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:33,563
Yes, sir?

1166
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,941
The Governor wants to
take Tanque.

1167
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,943
- I know.
- A massive operation.

1168
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,695
He thinks the weapons are there.

1169
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,073
- Are you getting feeds from there?
- Yes, I am.

1170
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,327
So mobilize everyone,
I want to hear everything, ok?

1171
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:48,995
- Got it.
- We have little time.

1172
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,998
That's right.
The militia was so sure...

1173
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,209
that the government would
rid Tanque of the dealers...

1174
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,629
that they were already recruiting
people to keep them out.

1175
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,632
And to scare dealers, my friend...

1176
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,634
nothing better than the Skulls.

1177
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,010
Ah, he's here.

1178
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,013
Sup, Fbio.
Hey, buddy.

1179
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:08,265
Sup, Rocha.

1180
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:11,268
Sup, Matias. How you doing, man?
A beer, please.

1181
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,519
Good?

1182
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,939
- Cool, mate?
- What do you want with me?

1183
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,649
What I want is simplicity.

1184
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,693
Look at the neighborhood, partner.
Just look.

1185
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,028
A mother can walk with
her son peacefully.

1186
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:24,030
The vans are working.
Look at the MP there.

1187
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:26,658
No one has to hide their wallet
to go to work anymore.

1188
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:27,659
It's not like before.

1189
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,494
It was a fucking mess, partner.

1190
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:31,288
And there's no more theft.

1191
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:33,123
The slum is damn good to live in.

1192
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:36,042
- What's that got to do with me?
- Shit, Matias.

1193
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:38,879
I learned that the police will do
a massive operation in Tanque.

1194
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,631
If the MP invades, it'll
be easy for us to occupy it.

1195
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:44,009
And I don't know anyone
better than you to...

1196
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,635
- manage this here.
- Me?

1197
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,304
Fucking Skulls, man.

1198
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,306
Someone the thugs fear.

1199
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,390
Aren't you a Skull?

1200
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,350
You'll understand what I'm saying.

1201
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:56,646
Godfather, can you hear me?

1202
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,900
- Talk to me.
- Godfather, listen.

1203
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:02,068
What can we do to return
a friend to BOPE?

1204
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:04,696
- Help him out.
- Is he solid? Can I trust him?

1205
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,073
More than solid, godfather. 100%.

1206
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,241
The best Skull we got.

1207
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,118
He's going to help us with the project.

1208
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:13,121
Get his ID and tell him
to show up Monday.

1209
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:17,542
So, Matias? You going
back to BOPE or what?

1210
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,506
Hey, boss...

1211
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,425
No one got that shit
and they're already calling...

1212
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,385
No one wants to show
these guns.

1213
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,347
Poke Moleira coz this shit's
about to get hot.

1214
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:33,099
I already talked to Moleira,
he thought it was you too.

1215
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,519
He said to stay alert coz the
cops are pissed.

1216
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,107
I joined this meeting
to say that the taps...

1217
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:43,610
proved that the dealers
didn't know shit...

1218
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:44,945
- about stolen arms.
- Secretary.

1219
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,571
- Good afternoon.
- I know what to do.

1220
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,739
- Sorry I'm late.
- Nascimento.

1221
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,158
But when I came in,
I couldn't utter a word.

1222
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,376
I was reviewing the intel.

1223
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:03,588
Secretary, our opinion remains
the same...

1224
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:05,924
there is no reason
to justify an invasion.

1225
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:09,052
Subsecretary, the Governor
gave the order to invade.

1226
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:12,681
And we have reliable info
from Colonel Fbio's informant...

1227
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,140
- Right, Colonel?
- Affirmative.

1228
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:15,600
That the arms are there.

1229
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,144
Plus I think the dealers...

1230
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:19,604
are deceiving you on the phone.

1231
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:21,731
Secretary, excuse me,
with all due respect...

1232
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:24,442
but I have 300 hours
of phone recordings here.

1233
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:29,406
That's 300 hours of recording
against the word of one informant...

1234
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,616
that only Colonel Fbio knows.

1235
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:34,494
Secretary, with all due respect,
my informant is reliable.

1236
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:37,664
Colonel, can you tell us
the name of your informant?

1237
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,416
- Nascimento!
- My informant is reliable.

1238
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,500
Can you tell us...

1239
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:42,210
- who your informant is.
- Nascimento!

1240
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:45,422
This operation is wrong,
Formoso.

1241
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:48,174
The arms aren't there.
This operation is wrong.

1242
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,011
Secretary, if the intel is correct...

1243
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,637
then there's no reason to invade.

1244
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:00,437
Let me consult with the Governor,
just a minute.

1245
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:05,150
Telephone for Dr. Guaracy.

1246
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:08,653
Come in.

1247
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,364
- Telefone, sir.
- Thank you.

1248
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,117
Hello?

1249
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:18,538
Formoso, I won't
speak to the Governor.

1250
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,499
He's for invasion. Invade
that shit and pronto.

1251
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,668
Right.

1252
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,463
The Governor ordered us
to proceed.

1253
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:28,965
We're invading.
Excuse me.

1254
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:31,259
Excuse me.

1255
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,178
Valmir, take this to the car
for me.

1256
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,055
Can I speak to you for a minute?

1257
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:41,311
- What, sir?
- I want to know...

1258
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,229
how you got back into BOPE.

1259
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:45,941
If you don't know...

1260
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:48,944
then, clearly, it wasn't
you who helped me, sir.

1261
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:53,573
Permission to leave?

1262
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,916
Permission granted, Andr.

1263
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:08,004
The cops in Tanque were
so corrupt that not even I...

1264
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:10,256
could get rid of the thugs there.

1265
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,550
To take Tanque, only a massive
operation would do.

1266
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:13,593
Check out those guys.

1267
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:15,220
But the Governor didn't want that.

1268
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,722
In an election year, there
could be no dead bystanders.

1269
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,059
And that's when Matias
had a genius idea...

1270
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,727
but dangerous as hell.

1271
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:26,439
He entered Tanque in broad
daylight and rolled in slowly...

1272
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,274
right in front of the thugs.

1273
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:29,985
Zero One, check that guy, there.

1274
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,319
Hey, what's up.

1275
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:33,738
There were guns everywhere.

1276
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:37,450
If anyone suspected a thing,
Matias was fucked.

1277
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:42,080
But Matias was disguised as
a dirty cop...

1278
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,499
and the thugs thought
they were among friends.

1279
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,293
- All good, partner?
- All good.

1280
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:48,920
You can go.

1281
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,505
Ok, thanks. Good job, guys.

1282
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:51,506
Quiet?

1283
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,762
Boco, Moraes, do the rounds
below for me?

1284
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:59,055
Going.

1285
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,725
The team spent the night
in the outpost...

1286
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:04,936
at a strategic point in the slum
waiting for daybreak.

1287
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,147
Waiting for us to invade.

1288
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:46,603
Shoot them!

1289
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:50,148
Go, go, go!

1290
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,014
Go, go, goddamn it!

1291
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:25,183
Whenever we tried
to invade Tanque...

1292
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:27,227
Felpa's gang escaped
the same way.

1293
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,479
The MPs would land...

1294
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:33,274
the thugs would jet.

1295
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:37,070
Go! Hurry the fuck up!

1296
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,324
The armored car followed
as far as possible.

1297
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:46,204
When the convoy hit
Felpa's alleys, he resisted.

1298
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:52,460
He held everyone up until
his posse spilled toward the outpost.

1299
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:55,713
The MPs there wouldn't
even see the punks pass.

1300
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:58,007
It was a game with marked cards.

1301
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:01,219
But that day, my friend...

1302
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,972
it wasn't the paid-off MPs
that were at the outpost.

1303
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:05,932
It was the Skulls.

1304
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,688
- Going for it, Zero One.
- Wait.

1305
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:14,065
- Going for it.
- Wait.

1306
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:15,441
Fire!

1307
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:24,075
Die, you fucks!

1308
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,162
- Go, go!
- Die.

1309
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,418
Go, let's go.
Let's go!

1310
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:41,926
Attention, Boco!
Let's check the weapons.

1311
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,722
One by one the dealers
of Tanque would die.

1312
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,725
The whole West Side would be
in the hands of Rocha...

1313
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,352
and join the constituency
of the administration.

1314
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,731
Zero One, I think that's all.
Call the Colonel?

1315
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,985
- Call him.
- Show the weapons, Boco!

1316
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:01,738
Ask him to show the weapons,
Valmir.

1317
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:07,076
Hey, Zero One, show them.

1318
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,206
- Hey, Azevedo?
- Those aren't the arms.

1319
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,124
Those aren't from the station.

1320
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:15,251
- Are you recording this, Valmir?
- Yes, sir.

1321
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,504
You know what this operation
should be called?

1322
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:20,924
- No, sir.
- Operation Iraq.

1323
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:26,221
The strategy of the system
was well thought-out.

1324
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:29,349
The drug lord of Tanque
could even escape...

1325
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:32,185
but he'd never have
the courage to return.

1326
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,528
Check the punk there.
The punk! Felpa.

1327
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:43,529
It's Felpa.

1328
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:45,365
Let BOPE take him out, Fbio.

1329
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,243
- Tatu! Boco!
- What?

1330
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:49,994
- There!
- Where'd he go, Zero One?

1331
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:51,454
- There, in the alley.
- There.

1332
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,915
Didn't I tell you BOPE
would go get him. There.

1333
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,334
Move! Fucking move!

1334
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,302
Give up!

1335
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,555
I give up. I give up, fuck!

1336
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:11,432
Just one problem.

1337
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:14,936
Rocha called for Matias
to work with him.

1338
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:16,145
- I surrender.
- Tie him up, Boco.

1339
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:18,439
And I'm the one who trained
Matias, my friend.

1340
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,526
He wouldn't stop until
he had found those arms.

1341
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:24,362
- It wouldn't be pretty.
- You're the boss?

1342
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:26,155
I am.

1343
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:28,950
So here's what you'll do...

1344
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:33,997
you'll tell me now where
the police weapons are.

1345
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:35,456
What police weapons?

1346
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:36,958
Dunno shit about no weapons, man.

1347
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,002
- You don't, huh?
- Dunno shit about no weapons.

1348
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,586
- Where are the guns?
- Dunno about guns.

1349
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:43,256
- I'm telling you!
- Where are the guns?

1350
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:45,216
What guns? I dunno!
Let's work it out...

1351
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:47,093
- I dunno about no guns!
- Listen, punk.

1352
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,470
This ain't a negotiation.

1353
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:52,181
I want to know where
the fuck those guns are!

1354
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:54,434
- I dunno about no fucking guns!
- Talk!

1355
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:56,102
- I dunno
- Talk, you fuck.

1356
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,021
- Fucking talk.
- I don't fucking know.

1357
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,147
I don't fucking know!

1358
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,398
Let's work him over,
Zero One.

1359
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,566
Put him in the bag.

1360
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:07,572
Fuck, this is taking forever.

1361
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,240
Let's check this shit out.

1362
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:10,616
Come on, Nunes.
Marreco, come.

1363
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:12,076
- Check it out?
- Take over, Gonalves.

1364
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:13,578
Let's go.

1365
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:15,997
He's fucked up, Zero One.

1366
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,415
He doesn't know anything.

1367
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,460
Look at me, cocksucker.

1368
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:21,627
You're gonna tell me...

1369
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:24,172
where the police weapons are
right now, got it?

1370
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,132
- I don't got 'em.
- You don't got 'em, huh?

1371
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:29,010
You got 'em. Tell me now
where they are!

1372
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,470
Talk, motherfucker.

1373
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,555
I don't got 'em. I don't...

1374
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,640
- Don't want to cooperate?
- I already told you...

1375
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:36,476
- Don't want to cooperate?
- I don't got 'em...

1376
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:39,020
Put him in the bag again,
Boco.

1377
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,028
What the fuck, Rocha?

1378
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:49,197
Are you fucking nuts?

1379
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,532
He was the boss!
He was gonna give me the arms!

1380
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:54,035
Well done. Excellent work by
BOPE, Captain.

1381
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:55,495
That's who we were after.

1382
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:56,996
Right, Commander?

1383
01:12:57,081 --> 01:13:00,041
- What's going on, Fbio?
- Sad for the thug, Matias?

1384
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:03,169
Boco! Tatu! Take the boss down...

1385
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:05,505
so I can have a litle chat
with Fbio.

1386
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:11,427
What the fuck, Colonel?
What's going on?

1387
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:14,222
I smell bullshit.

1388
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:18,309
- Who's the informant?
- I'll find out and let you know.

1389
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,103
Who's X9?

1390
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:25,066
Here's what you'll do,
you'll call me...

1391
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:28,361
later, you'll give me
the name and number of X9.

1392
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:31,489
And I want this today!

1393
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:35,326
Understood, Major?

1394
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:47,338
Stop! What the fuck, Russo?

1395
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:50,591
What the fuck, Marreco?
What the fuck?

1396
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:53,511
You fucking killed him!

1397
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:55,346
Fuck, didn't you want
him out of the way?

1398
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:57,056
He's out of the way.
What you want?

1399
01:13:57,057 --> 01:13:58,683
You're gonna light a candle
for this fucking Skull?

1400
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:02,103
Marreco, mark 15 minutes...

1401
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:04,480
inform the superior of this shit...

1402
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:06,566
say the bullet came from
who the fuck knows.

1403
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,485
And say that me and
Commander Fbio...

1404
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,029
were not on location.

1405
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,281
Right, Fbio?

1406
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,284
Let's go, Fbio.

1407
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:19,370
Let's get the fuck out.

1408
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,041
Let's go, Fbio!

1409
01:15:03,373 --> 01:15:05,166
You won't investigate
his death, Secretary?

1410
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,709
We're waiting on
Ballistics, Colonel.

1411
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:08,377
The ballistics are this,
Formoso:...

1412
01:15:08,378 --> 01:15:10,087
Andr died from a bullet
in the back...

1413
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:12,632
far from his squad,
and the arms weren't there.

1414
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:14,467
Nascimento, I understand your pain...

1415
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:16,552
I know this is difficult...

1416
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:19,096
but you must understand
the public supported the operation.

1417
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:21,349
11 dealers dead and
15 weapons seized.

1418
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,184
Major Matias was a casualty.

1419
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,227
Could have been anyone.

1420
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,686
Matias wasn't just anyone.

1421
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:42,453
Salute.

1422
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:50,211
Fire!

1423
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,547
Attention!

1424
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:26,622
Colonel Fbio? Can I speak
with you for a minute?

1425
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:31,252
Colonel. A terrible loss
to our organization.

1426
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:34,130
My condolences.
Excuse me.

1427
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,926
I will investigate his death.

1428
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:42,513
And I will find out what
happened to Andr, Fbio.

1429
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:45,725
If you know something,
you'd better tell me now.

1430
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:50,730
Nascimento, Andr was
also my friend.

1431
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:54,108
And I believe in my men.

1432
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:58,279
If you find out anything,
let me know.

1433
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,078
This is gonna go to shit.

1434
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:08,164
- Go to shit, why?
- Because it will.

1435
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:09,165
What did you want me to do?

1436
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,374
The guy gets in my face and...

1437
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:11,709
- I just stand there?
- So what?

1438
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:12,918
And Nascimento's on my ass.

1439
01:17:12,919 --> 01:17:14,128
- Who's on your ass.
- Nascimento!

1440
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:15,379
Fuck Nascimento.

1441
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,090
- Kojak, coffee, please.
- Water for me.

1442
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:19,999
- Hey, Nunes?
- Major. Commander.

1443
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,135
Listen, buddy.

1444
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,554
Nascimento doesn't have
anything on us.

1445
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:25,640
And another thing, partner.

1446
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,308
If I'm in deep shit,
you're in deep shit.

1447
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:28,351
You should remember that.

1448
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:30,561
And you should know that
now everything's 50-50.

1449
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:31,979
50-50, no fucking way, Fbio.

1450
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,273
Fucking way.
The "I know" tax, Rocha.

1451
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:35,608
The what tax?

1452
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,526
Are you out of your mind?
You forgot?

1453
01:17:38,111 --> 01:17:39,695
If you wanna giggle,
you gotta tickle.

1454
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,658
Motherfucker.
Kojak, hold that shit.

1455
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,951
- I'm off, Nunes.
- It's all on his tab now, Kojak.

1456
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:48,329
- Ok, commander.
- Nunes, how's everything?

1457
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,748
Like an ocean, boss.
Salty, ain't it?

1458
01:17:51,124 --> 01:17:53,918
Took me a long time to realize
my work in the government...

1459
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:56,170
had nothing to do with
public security.

1460
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:59,006
Valmir, we're not going to
renew the requests...

1461
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:01,550
for the wiretaps of the
operation in the Tanque.

1462
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,427
Excuse me.
Colonel Nascimento said...

1463
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:04,720
That's all, Valmir. Thank you.

1464
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:07,056
It was all a stategy to get votes.

1465
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:10,559
To them, Matias' death
meant nothing.

1466
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:13,729
In the media, the operation
had been a success.

1467
01:18:14,564 --> 01:18:16,315
That was all that mattered.

1468
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,026
You called Rafa?

1469
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:25,658
- No.
- What is it, Beto?

1470
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:32,456
- What happened?
- They killed Andr.

1471
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:37,002
I heard.
Are you taking care of yourself?

1472
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:41,257
I don't know what's happening.

1473
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:44,927
I'm going to find out.

1474
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:52,476
We haven't been talking...

1475
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:55,312
for some time.

1476
01:18:58,066 --> 01:18:59,692
- Beto...
- He was right.

1477
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:05,197
- Andr was right.
- Beto, I want to know about Rafa.

1478
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:08,117
I'm sorry about Andr...

1479
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,578
but I want you to call your son.

1480
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,249
You're alienating yourself,
Beto.

1481
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,627
Don't do this to your son.

1482
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:21,422
He was only protecting
his friend.

1483
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,424
You should be proud.

1484
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:26,135
Don't waste time...

1485
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:28,429
don't wait for him to
want to talk to you.

1486
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:31,098
Call Rafa to have a chat.

1487
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,962
You're gonna trade your
neck for your arm?

1488
01:20:11,723 --> 01:20:13,265
Breathe.

1489
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,267
Relax.

1490
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:23,275
Breathe.

1491
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:35,538
Come. Come. Mount.
Get on.

1492
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,385
Son!

1493
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:02,147
You think I believed
that weed was yours?

1494
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:13,576
Julia must be pretty hot
for you to take the rap...

1495
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:16,161
for 100 grams of weed
right in front of me, huh?

1496
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:20,708
I'm not afraid of you.

1497
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:28,048
I don't want you to be
afraid of me.

1498
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:35,556
I want you to know
that I'm your father.

1499
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:38,392
I know.

1500
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:43,731
- Do you?
- I do.

1501
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:53,532
- You really know?
- I know.

1502
01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:59,622
Wow, I'll even let you grab
my arm again.

1503
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:01,415
Grab it.

1504
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:04,376
You only grab it when I let you.

1505
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:06,587
Wait, wait.

1506
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:18,057
Yes, Valmir.

1507
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:24,063
I know... You know why
this will go on, Valmir?

1508
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:27,066
You know why this will go on?

1509
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:29,318
Because what they want
are votes, Valmir.

1510
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:32,404
I don't want votes, I want
to know who killed Andr.

1511
01:22:38,912 --> 01:22:40,663
I appreciate it, then.

1512
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:44,291
I'm with my son,
we'll talk later, ok?

1513
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:49,421
Ok. Thanks.
Thank you.

1514
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:52,925
Your friend died in the operation?

1515
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:56,345
Something to do with the militia
that stole the guns?

1516
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:01,058
Who told you this?

1517
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,062
I bet a year's salary that
it was the militia...

1518
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:07,022
who stole the guns and
will invade the slum...

1519
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:09,984
I'll accept it, but only
as an investigative report.

1520
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,235
Investigative?

1521
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:12,319
- More than...
- I need deeper.

1522
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,530
I need documents,
photos, statements.

1523
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,615
Infiltrate. Disguise yourself.
Figure it out.

1524
01:23:17,575 --> 01:23:20,160
Camelo, wait.
Give me the cover then.

1525
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:22,204
Bring me the goods, all right?

1526
01:23:23,373 --> 01:23:25,040
You'll give me the cover?

1527
01:23:28,294 --> 01:23:31,296
Tap the landline now.
Today.

1528
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:34,133
The mobile, put it on
account of some probe.

1529
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:35,718
I want to hear everything
Fraga says...

1530
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:37,302
- to this journalist, got it?
- Colonel...

1531
01:23:37,303 --> 01:23:39,596
- he's a representative.
- I take full responsibility.

1532
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:43,225
What time do you get off?

1533
01:23:43,226 --> 01:23:45,561
Hey partner, can't hear you
well. Still hissing.

1534
01:23:46,312 --> 01:23:47,938
I'll check the signal.

1535
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:55,320
- Ok.
- Beautiful.

1536
01:23:56,322 --> 01:23:58,657
Preparing to record.

1537
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:00,951
Recording.

1538
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,205
If it were up to Rocha...

1539
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:07,416
the militia would enter
Tanque real slow.

1540
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:09,293
No one would even notice.

1541
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,546
Look here, Clara, here.

1542
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:15,591
You see the scratch there?
You see?

1543
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,259
- Where? The white bit?
- That's it.

1544
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,343
What about it?

1545
01:24:18,344 --> 01:24:20,220
I think it's the coat-of-arms
of the police.

1546
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:22,306
They scratched it out
to disguise themselves.

1547
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,600
But the election was coming up.

1548
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:25,684
They were pushing...

1549
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:28,353
and Rocha set up camp
in the house of a widow.

1550
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:30,731
- I have to go in somehow.
- Easy, easy, easy.

1551
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,149
- I have to go in.
- Easy!

1552
01:24:32,275 --> 01:24:33,609
And gas?

1553
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:36,236
Gas got us 8,600.

1554
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:40,532
This here keeps sadness at bay.
A beautiful thing, my friend.

1555
01:24:40,992 --> 01:24:42,618
As soon as the media
forgot Tanque...

1556
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:45,079
the militia would probably
microwave her.

1557
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,164
Mrs. Olga, first month
in advance.

1558
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:50,167
Her house would become HQ
for the police patrol...

1559
01:24:50,376 --> 01:24:52,628
and Rocha would
terrorize the slum.

1560
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:54,004
An almost perfect plan.

1561
01:24:54,005 --> 01:24:55,380
Look.
I think they're leaving.

1562
01:24:55,381 --> 01:24:57,216
Easy, easy, Clara.
Easy, Clara.

1563
01:24:57,217 --> 01:24:58,425
Forget easy. Let's go!

1564
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,636
Hide the camera.
Come on.

1565
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:03,388
The photos were already enough
for the cover.

1566
01:25:03,389 --> 01:25:05,265
Say that we're a couple
looking for a rental.

1567
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:07,351
But journalists, my friend,
are curious.

1568
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:09,978
Clara wouldn't rest until
she discovered...

1569
01:25:09,979 --> 01:25:11,605
what was in that house.

1570
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,023
How's this thing here?

1571
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:16,276
Twenty. Aranha, have a ball.

1572
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:17,903
Keep an eye out,
they're fuckers.

1573
01:25:17,904 --> 01:25:19,363
When they get more,
it's fucked...

1574
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:20,739
- Hey, godfather.
- Fucking around?

1575
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:22,658
- We did the collection.
- Goddamn it.

1576
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:25,035
I told you not to walk around
with these guns in Tanque.

1577
01:25:25,036 --> 01:25:26,370
We went quickly
and came back.

1578
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:28,705
- Who stayed at at the base?
- Who's at the base?

1579
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:31,041
- No one.
- No fucking one?

1580
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:32,292
Didn't I tell you to call...

1581
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:33,961
Are you fucking kidding me?

1582
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,213
Shit, Nunes. 20 years
in this shit, huh.

1583
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:38,715
Like I told you,
the price is 700.

1584
01:25:38,716 --> 01:25:40,134
Ok, deal.

1585
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,427
When a journalist smells a scoop,
get out the way.

1586
01:25:42,428 --> 01:25:43,679
It's a bit messy...

1587
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,640
but take a look,
and I'll be back, ok?

1588
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:47,683
Ok, thank you.

1589
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:49,935
- It's great.
- Clara sweet-talked the widow...

1590
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:52,688
promised her the world and
the widow was as high as a kite.

1591
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:56,191
Hello. Hi, Mrs. Olga, yes?

1592
01:25:57,193 --> 01:25:59,945
No, I'm not gonna pay more
than what we agreed.

1593
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:02,281
What couple, Mrs. Olga?!

1594
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:04,950
- That's how people are...
- Clara...

1595
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:06,702
they only care about themselves.

1596
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,626
Check this out.

1597
01:26:18,089 --> 01:26:19,548
- Whoa.
- Hello.

1598
01:26:19,757 --> 01:26:21,300
Get the camera.

1599
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:26,638
Fraga, it's Clara. Fraga,
I'm in the Tanque neighborhood.

1600
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:27,681
Doing what, Clara?

1601
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:30,100
I found the guys who stole
the guns from the station.

1602
01:26:30,101 --> 01:26:32,144
Now I'm certain
it was the militia.

1603
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:35,105
Clara, listen to me.
Get out now, Clara.

1604
01:26:35,231 --> 01:26:37,065
These people are very dangerous.

1605
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:38,400
No, it's ok.
It's all ok.

1606
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:41,528
No, I went in the house.
You won't believe this.

1607
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:43,530
I found the Governor's
campaign materials.

1608
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:46,033
There's posters, banners,
everything.

1609
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:48,118
No, it's full of
photos of the Governor

1610
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:49,536
with Fortunato and Guaracy.

1611
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:51,288
Clara, who are you with?
Are you alone?

1612
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,539
Calm down...

1613
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:58,128
Who's on the phone, bitch?

1614
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:00,923
- Give me that.
- Take it easy.

1615
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:02,966
- What are you doing here?
- Take it easy...

1616
01:27:02,967 --> 01:27:04,718
- Clara? Can you hear me?
- Take it easy...

1617
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,261
Hello? Clara?

1618
01:27:06,429 --> 01:27:09,139
- What's wrong?
- Where are the car keys?

1619
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:12,142
- What happened?
- The militia's got Clara.

1620
01:27:12,143 --> 01:27:14,102
There's at least 20 years
of jail for us here.

1621
01:27:14,103 --> 01:27:16,605
- Oh yeah? You're X9? You're what?
- No.

1622
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:19,524
You scared? You scared?

1623
01:27:19,525 --> 01:27:21,318
Motherfucker.
You scared?

1624
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,736
Stop it!

1625
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:25,280
Take this bitch to
the living room.

1626
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:26,782
- Get the fuck up.
- Give me the keys.

1627
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:28,450
Let the police take care of it...

1628
01:27:28,451 --> 01:27:30,160
The police are exactly
the problem.

1629
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:31,286
Honey, give me the keys.

1630
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:33,080
Call me then, please.

1631
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:34,915
Diogo, for God's sake. Diogo!

1632
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:39,586
Rep. Fraga.
Who else knows you're here?

1633
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:48,136
You want to get a
beating then?

1634
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,431
Don't do that, boss.
She's fine.

1635
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:53,141
Let me play with her first.

1636
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,355
Finish with her, then, and
then clean up the mess.

1637
01:27:59,565 --> 01:28:00,774
No!

1638
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:02,109
- Take off your clothes.
- No.

1639
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:03,568
- Take off your fucking clothes.
- No!

1640
01:28:08,574 --> 01:28:09,741
Chief.

1641
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:14,454
Nothing? Well, Representative,
that's it.

1642
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,582
Without evidence it's hard,
you know?

1643
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,419
No witnesses, nothing.

1644
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:24,965
Look, if we find a body,
any clue...

1645
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:26,967
you'll be the first
to know, ok?

1646
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,179
She was telling me
on the phone...

1647
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:34,099
she had found the stolen weapons,
before she was interrupted.

1648
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:36,435
Obviously, she was surprised
by those guys.

1649
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:38,228
You have to publish this, Camelo.

1650
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:40,022
I've got nothing to publish,
I have no proof.

1651
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:41,231
Proof, Camelo?!

1652
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:43,567
The government is our partner.
My hands are tied.

1653
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:46,028
What you have on your hands
is a missing employee.

1654
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:49,281
Obviously, the militia killed Clara
and ditched her body.

1655
01:28:49,282 --> 01:28:50,449
What body, Fraga?

1656
01:28:51,951 --> 01:28:53,577
She was working for your paper.

1657
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:55,454
All this came with the job.

1658
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,501
To be or not to be,
that is the question, partner.

1659
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:05,505
What would be more noble
for the militia?

1660
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:09,176
Kill the vermin that
enter our lives...

1661
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:12,637
or live to enjoy the
buzz of a beer?

1662
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,014
Tell me, Gonalves.

1663
01:29:14,265 --> 01:29:15,557
Enough with the bullshit!

1664
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:16,933
You're quoting the bible,
now?

1665
01:29:16,934 --> 01:29:20,103
Bible? It's a novella,
you dumbfuck.

1666
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:23,940
- Hurry. Pull those teeth out.
- This shit stinks.

1667
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:27,110
But are you sure the
journalist called Fraga?

1668
01:29:28,237 --> 01:29:30,530
Guaracy, there's a 3-minute
call here.

1669
01:29:30,948 --> 01:29:32,282
You think for a bedtime story?

1670
01:29:32,283 --> 01:29:33,450
She opened her trap.

1671
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:37,496
Goddamn it. This is very
serious, huh, Representative.

1672
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,956
What are we gonna do?

1673
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,460
"We"?
What are YOU gonna do?

1674
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:45,545
Fraga is your problem.

1675
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:51,510
Representative, easy,
Fraga is our problem.

1676
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,262
And we take care of
our problems.

1677
01:29:54,972 --> 01:29:56,515
Farewell, Guaracy.

1678
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:59,226
I found the guys who stole
the arms from the station.

1679
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:01,311
Now I'm certain
it was the militia.

1680
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:03,230
Clara, listen to me.
Get out now, Clara.

1681
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:04,648
These people are very dangerous.

1682
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:05,690
You won't believe this.

1683
01:30:05,691 --> 01:30:07,692
I found the Governor's
campaign commitee.

1684
01:30:07,693 --> 01:30:10,112
There's posters, banners,
everything.

1685
01:30:10,113 --> 01:30:12,322
No, it's full of
photos of the Governor

1686
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:13,490
with Fortunato and Guaracy.

1687
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:15,158
Clara, who are you with?
Are you alone?

1688
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:17,619
Who's on the phone, bitch?

1689
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:19,955
- Hello? Clara?
- Give me that.

1690
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:22,082
- Take it easy!
- Play the end, Valmir, just the end.

1691
01:30:24,168 --> 01:30:25,252
You won't believe this.

1692
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:27,254
I found the Governor's
campaign commitee.

1693
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,506
There's posters, banners,
everything.

1694
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:31,550
No, it's full of
photos of the Governor

1695
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:33,093
with Fortunato and Guaracy.

1696
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:34,428
Clara, who are you with?
Are you alone?

1697
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:36,096
- When was this, Valmir?
- 11 p.m.

1698
01:30:36,472 --> 01:30:37,973
- Is it in the system?
- Not yet.

1699
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:39,391
It's here, in my recorder.

1700
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:46,731
It's like I got punched
in the face.

1701
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:48,567
In one blow...

1702
01:30:48,568 --> 01:30:51,069
I had discovered
it wasn't just the militia...

1703
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:52,696
that was behind the
arms robbery,...

1704
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:55,574
Clara's disappearance,
and Andr's murder.

1705
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:02,581
The militia wouldn't
campaign for the Governor...

1706
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:04,166
and Guaracy for free.

1707
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,626
The hole went a lot deeper.

1708
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:12,007
I was surrounded by enemies.
Real enemies.

1709
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:16,011
The Secretariat of Security
was the core of the system.

1710
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:19,014
Public security in the State
of Rio de Janeiro...

1711
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:21,266
was in the hands of crooks.

1712
01:31:21,267 --> 01:31:23,602
- And I could trust no one.
- Nascimento.

1713
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:25,312
Perfect, I'll deliver it.

1714
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:28,148
The arms robbery
and Matias' death...

1715
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,233
meant nothing for the system.

1716
01:31:32,028 --> 01:31:34,154
The system is ruled by politics...

1717
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:36,198
and politics only respects the media.

1718
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:39,993
Only this time, the militia
had killed a journalist.

1719
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:42,287
The system would have to catch up.

1720
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,539
- Valmir.
- Secretary.

1721
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:46,708
Valmir, tap this number for me.

1722
01:31:49,212 --> 01:31:51,171
This is the phone of Rep. Fraga?

1723
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:52,631
Tap it.

1724
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:56,218
- It was already intercepted.
- How's that?

1725
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:00,096
Colonel Nascimento ordered
its interception.

1726
01:32:00,097 --> 01:32:01,473
Fine, give me a copy...

1727
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:03,308
and you can delete the file.

1728
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:05,602
He just took it with him.

1729
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:08,230
The evidence had been microwaved.

1730
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:12,275
There were no witnesses.
It was right in my face.

1731
01:32:12,443 --> 01:32:15,237
The system was going to kill Fraga.
And soon.

1732
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:18,240
- Did you like it, son?
- Fraga was next.

1733
01:32:23,162 --> 01:32:24,704
Goddamn it, Rosane.

1734
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:27,040
Rosane, it's Roberto again.

1735
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:28,208
I'm on your street...

1736
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:31,253
I'll wait for you at the
door of your building, ok?

1737
01:32:31,462 --> 01:32:33,171
When you get this message..

1738
01:32:33,172 --> 01:32:35,590
I'll be at your building door,
you'll find me there.

1739
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:43,390
- Your dad called, Rafa?
- Why?

1740
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:46,560
Nothing... just to know.

1741
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:57,112
- Mom, there's Dad!
- Your Dad?

1742
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:16,256
No! Stay in the car!
Rosana.

1743
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:19,175
Rafa!

1744
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:23,096
- Get in the car!
- Talk to me, Rafa!

1745
01:33:23,306 --> 01:33:25,724
Drive! Drive!
Go! Go! Go!

1746
01:33:26,309 --> 01:33:27,976
Oh my god!

1747
01:33:28,477 --> 01:33:29,603
Go!

1748
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:46,578
What did the doctor say?

1749
01:33:46,579 --> 01:33:49,289
The surgery will take
7 to 8 hours...

1750
01:33:49,665 --> 01:33:53,335
because he was shot
in the kidney.

1751
01:33:55,087 --> 01:33:57,297
He said he will be...
he will...

1752
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:27,327
- Beto...
- I'll be back, I'll be back.

1753
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:29,245
Even by chance...

1754
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:32,248
the system ends up hurting us
where it hursts most.

1755
01:34:33,584 --> 01:34:35,126
It's going to take 7 to 8 hours...

1756
01:34:35,127 --> 01:34:36,336
I spent my entire life...

1757
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,630
believing that the police
could do the right thing.

1758
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:39,923
It'll be fine.

1759
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:42,717
One hour to the next, all
that conviction was gone.

1760
01:34:45,429 --> 01:34:47,263
I had no alternative.

1761
01:34:47,556 --> 01:34:49,641
I'd have to hit
the system head-on.

1762
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:53,436
Doctor, there's a checkpoint
in front of your condo.

1763
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:57,148
How's that, Braddock?

1764
01:34:57,149 --> 01:34:58,942
There's a checkpoint
in front of your condo.

1765
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:00,026
Can I stop, Doctor?

1766
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:02,987
But, in Brazil, it's hard
to arrest authorities.

1767
01:35:02,988 --> 01:35:04,948
Pull over, so I can
straighten them out.

1768
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:06,616
So a politician, forget it.

1769
01:35:06,909 --> 01:35:08,284
Stop the fucking car.

1770
01:35:08,285 --> 01:35:10,370
Imagine how fucked up it'd
be if BOPE worked over

1771
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:12,622
a corrupt representative
just like a dealer.

1772
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:14,708
Lower your weapon, son.

1773
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,668
Who's in charge here?

1774
01:35:17,586 --> 01:35:18,586
I am.

1775
01:35:18,587 --> 01:35:21,089
Wait... What's this?
What's this?

1776
01:35:26,053 --> 01:35:28,722
You motherfucker. Look at me.

1777
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:29,973
Look at me!

1778
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:32,267
If anything happens
to my son...

1779
01:35:32,643 --> 01:35:35,311
if anything happens to
anyone in my family...

1780
01:35:35,312 --> 01:35:37,522
if my son dies,
I will kill everyone.

1781
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:39,190
You understand?
Look at me!

1782
01:35:39,442 --> 01:35:43,445
And the first to die will
be you, you motherfucker.

1783
01:36:14,518 --> 01:36:15,935
Your honor.

1784
01:36:15,936 --> 01:36:17,437
You opened the CPI,
your honor?

1785
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:18,646
- What's this?
- What's this?!

1786
01:36:18,647 --> 01:36:21,524
Have you read the paper?
Dead journalist, Fortunato!

1787
01:36:21,525 --> 01:36:23,318
- People die everyday!
- What a mess.

1788
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:26,070
You subpoenaed Colonel
Roberto Nascimento!

1789
01:36:26,071 --> 01:36:28,072
- I did.
- A CPI during elections...

1790
01:36:28,073 --> 01:36:29,699
- helps this gentleman!
- Cynical.

1791
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:30,950
You're a punk!

1792
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:32,285
- Cynical.
- Calm down, Fortunato!

1793
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:34,579
If there's a CPI,
I'll be the narrator!

1794
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:36,080
Narrator, my ass!

1795
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:39,918
In this CPI, Representative,
you're under investigation.

1796
01:36:39,919 --> 01:36:42,045
- Punk!
- You're the punk.

1797
01:36:42,129 --> 01:36:44,506
- Calm down.
- I'll see you in session.

1798
01:36:44,507 --> 01:36:47,467
- Punk!
- Calm down, Fortunato.

1799
01:36:47,718 --> 01:36:49,469
Fortunato, calm down!

1800
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:52,347
First, I'd like to say
that this administration...

1801
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:55,099
supports the establishment of
the CPI and hopes...

1802
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:58,561
that our representatives will
help us discover the truth.

1803
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:01,105
I'd also like to say that
the search for the...

1804
01:37:01,106 --> 01:37:03,274
whereabouts of the
journalist and photographer...

1805
01:37:03,275 --> 01:37:06,528
was transferred to
the kidnapping division...

1806
01:37:07,029 --> 01:37:09,113
as there are no bodies,
and no clues...

1807
01:37:09,114 --> 01:37:13,117
I repeat, no evidence
that they were murdered.

1808
01:37:13,619 --> 01:37:15,995
The only evidence we have
until now...

1809
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:18,665
is the electronic recording
of Rep. Fraga...

1810
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:22,210
which was obtained illegally
via a wiretap...

1811
01:37:22,461 --> 01:37:24,504
ordered by Colonel
Roberto Nascimento...

1812
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:27,382
in the house of his ex-wife
to spy on her.

1813
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:29,592
The Governor, obviously...

1814
01:37:29,593 --> 01:37:33,054
has relieved Colonel Nascimento
of his duties and the military police...

1815
01:37:33,055 --> 01:37:35,473
has initiated the process
of his expulsion.

1816
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:27,233
The politicians were not
interested in my dying...

1817
01:38:27,234 --> 01:38:28,568
before I testify.

1818
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:31,613
I'd become a martyr of human rights
in the middle of a CPI...

1819
01:38:31,614 --> 01:38:33,281
and Fraga would turn the
Governor...

1820
01:38:33,282 --> 01:38:34,949
into a murder suspect.

1821
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:38,077
But the system doesn't have
central planning...

1822
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:39,579
nor a board of directors,
my friend.

1823
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:42,081
The system is an inhuman
mechanism...

1824
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:44,459
an expression of twisted
interests.

1825
01:38:45,127 --> 01:38:47,921
Let's go, folks. It's time.

1826
01:38:48,589 --> 01:38:49,714
- Sup, boss.
- Sup.

1827
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:51,507
I told you to hide the
shirt. Come on.

1828
01:38:52,509 --> 01:38:54,260
Pull in the front, Nunes.

1829
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:58,014
The Governor did
what was best for him...

1830
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:02,060
he smeared my name and
ended my police career.

1831
01:39:11,236 --> 01:39:12,695
I have to go, ok?

1832
01:39:17,409 --> 01:39:19,118
Call me if there's anything.

1833
01:39:23,248 --> 01:39:25,458
The tactic of the militia
would be different.

1834
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:28,127
Rocha knew if someone had
to go down in the CPI...

1835
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,254
the politicians would
dump it all on him.

1836
01:39:30,255 --> 01:39:32,173
Aranha, see where he is.

1837
01:39:32,424 --> 01:39:33,716
Where are you, partner?

1838
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:36,135
I'm in front of the pub.

1839
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:38,680
We'll wait behind the hospital.

1840
01:39:38,681 --> 01:39:40,264
Tell us when he comes out, ok?

1841
01:39:48,524 --> 01:39:52,068
For the militia, the sooner
I died, the better.

1842
01:39:52,945 --> 01:39:54,529
He's going to the parking lot.

1843
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:23,683
Attention. He's coming out.
He's at the door.

1844
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:25,685
Pull out, partner.
Pull out.

1845
01:40:39,992 --> 01:40:42,118
Let's go,
get that cocksucker!

1846
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:55,298
Luckily, I discovered...

1847
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:57,216
my true enemies in time.

1848
01:40:58,552 --> 01:41:01,262
When they came,
I wasn't alone.

1849
01:41:12,191 --> 01:41:13,733
- You ok?
- Skulls.

1850
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:17,737
He's on the ground.

1851
01:41:23,035 --> 01:41:24,452
I'm in,
I'm in, I'm in.

1852
01:41:29,208 --> 01:41:31,000
Behind the fucking car!

1853
01:41:31,627 --> 01:41:34,045
Go! Go! Get the other one
get the other one!

1854
01:41:35,214 --> 01:41:36,923
Let's go. Go!

1855
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:49,936
The motherfucker escaped...

1856
01:41:49,937 --> 01:41:52,438
but my war on the system
was just beginning.

1857
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:54,941
Now it was personal.

1858
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:58,277
And I would keep fighting,
but in a different way.

1859
01:42:01,657 --> 01:42:03,074
Silvio, please.

1860
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:07,453
The last page of the
document is missing.

1861
01:42:07,454 --> 01:42:10,289
Tell them I need
a xerox to distribute.

1862
01:42:17,256 --> 01:42:18,673
Excuse me, ladies
and gentlemen.

1863
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:21,300
May I have your attention...

1864
01:42:22,094 --> 01:42:25,721
so that we may hear
the testimony of...

1865
01:42:25,722 --> 01:42:28,683
- Colonel Roberto Nascimento.
- One moment, please.

1866
01:42:28,684 --> 01:42:32,186
I'd like to utter a few
words before this circus.

1867
01:42:32,187 --> 01:42:33,396
Representative, please.

1868
01:42:33,397 --> 01:42:36,983
This CPI was opened on
the eve of elections.

1869
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,318
This is just part of an
electoral campaign.

1870
01:42:39,319 --> 01:42:40,695
You are a clown!

1871
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:44,281
You're plotting against
the city of Rio de Janeiro.

1872
01:42:44,533 --> 01:42:47,034
You do not have the
right to speak.

1873
01:42:47,035 --> 01:42:48,202
I'm cutting your microphone.

1874
01:42:48,203 --> 01:42:51,455
Rep. Diogo Fraga, you are a clown!

1875
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:54,542
You're plotting against our city.

1876
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:57,628
You're plotting against us!

1877
01:42:57,629 --> 01:42:58,754
Gentlemen, please.

1878
01:42:58,755 --> 01:43:00,381
- Let's get to the questions.
- A circus!

1879
01:43:02,301 --> 01:43:04,302
Colonel Nascimento, are you ready?

1880
01:43:04,887 --> 01:43:07,054
Can we start with the questions?

1881
01:43:09,099 --> 01:43:10,349
If you'll allow...

1882
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:12,393
I would like to say a few words...

1883
01:43:12,394 --> 01:43:14,312
before answering questions.

1884
01:43:14,313 --> 01:43:16,647
You may. Take all the time
you need.

1885
01:43:22,404 --> 01:43:24,447
My name is Roberto Nascimento.

1886
01:43:26,116 --> 01:43:28,159
I am Lieutenant-Colonel
of the Military Police...

1887
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:29,744
of the State of Rio de Janeiro.

1888
01:43:31,288 --> 01:43:34,415
I've dedicated 21 years
of my life to the police.

1889
01:43:36,335 --> 01:43:38,920
It is thus not easy,
what I'm about to say...

1890
01:43:38,921 --> 01:43:41,756
but the truth is that the
MP of Rio needs to be abolished.

1891
01:43:47,346 --> 01:43:49,013
Please.

1892
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:57,521
When my son was 10...

1893
01:43:57,522 --> 01:44:01,025
he asked me why my job
was to kill.

1894
01:44:07,532 --> 01:44:10,785
My son Rafael,
who is now in the hospital...

1895
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:12,703
victim of a gunshot.

1896
01:44:16,541 --> 01:44:19,085
And I couldn't answer him.

1897
01:44:22,547 --> 01:44:25,383
I've been a cop 21 years
and I couldn't say...

1898
01:44:25,384 --> 01:44:28,427
for what and for whom
I killed.

1899
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:33,391
But what I can say,
without a doubt, Representatives...

1900
01:44:35,477 --> 01:44:38,354
is that a cop doesn't
pull the trigger alone.

1901
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:45,111
Rep. Fraga, half of your
colleagues in this house...

1902
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:47,321
should be in jail.

1903
01:44:49,157 --> 01:44:50,199
Gentlemen, please.

1904
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:54,203
I request silence for
the testimony. Please.

1905
01:44:54,204 --> 01:44:56,205
- Half is low, Representative.
- Let's maintain silence!

1906
01:44:56,206 --> 01:44:57,957
Please. Please.

1907
01:44:57,958 --> 01:45:00,001
Half is low, Representative.

1908
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:03,212
There are only 6 or 7
with a clean sheet.

1909
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:07,425
Gentlemen, let's maintain silence
for the testimony.

1910
01:45:07,426 --> 01:45:08,467
Please.

1911
01:45:08,468 --> 01:45:13,472
Rep. Fortunato,
you are the leader...

1912
01:45:13,473 --> 01:45:16,559
of one of the largest criminal
organizations in this city.

1913
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,437
Please! Let's maintain
silence, please.

1914
01:45:19,438 --> 01:45:22,148
You act in concert with
the Commander...

1915
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:24,442
the ex-Commander of the MP
of the State of Rio...

1916
01:45:24,443 --> 01:45:27,611
and ex-Secretary of Security,
Guaracy Novaes...

1917
01:45:27,612 --> 01:45:30,448
one of the worst crooks that
I've had the displeasure of knowing...

1918
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:32,074
in my life as a police officer.

1919
01:45:32,701 --> 01:45:34,618
And I can affirm here,
Representative...

1920
01:45:35,412 --> 01:45:37,455
that the Governor of the
State of Rio de Janeiro...

1921
01:45:37,456 --> 01:45:39,999
is directly involved in
the crimes...

1922
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,251
under investigation here
in this house.

1923
01:45:43,128 --> 01:45:48,257
I affirm that the Governor
of the State is involved...

1924
01:45:48,258 --> 01:45:51,427
in the crimes investigated
by Rep. Diogo Fraga.

1925
01:45:52,471 --> 01:45:55,264
Rep. Fortunato, you
are responsible for...

1926
01:45:55,932 --> 01:45:59,101
more than 20 murders
in the West Side of the city.

1927
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:04,440
Among which, you are responsible
for the murder of my friend...

1928
01:46:05,025 --> 01:46:08,277
Captain of the Military Police,
Andr Matias.

1929
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:13,240
Gentlemen, please!

1930
01:46:13,658 --> 01:46:17,244
Let's maintain silence,
please. Let's refrain...

1931
01:46:17,329 --> 01:46:19,663
I went to Fraga's CPI
to detonate the system.

1932
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:22,208
I went to speak the truth.

1933
01:46:22,209 --> 01:46:24,126
To say what I felt.

1934
01:46:24,961 --> 01:46:27,421
I told everything I knew,
I acknowledged my errors...

1935
01:46:27,589 --> 01:46:29,673
and spoke for over 3 hours.

1936
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:36,222
And knocked down a lot of people.

1937
01:46:38,433 --> 01:46:41,227
I put many corrupt
politicians in jail.

1938
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:44,688
Thanks to my speech,
there were fuckers...

1939
01:46:44,689 --> 01:46:47,108
who ended up in a ditch
long before I had hoped.

1940
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:51,570
It was the biggest paper-
shredding in Rio's history.

1941
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:56,534
And even then, the system
remained standing.

1942
01:46:58,412 --> 01:47:01,497
Take his gold and put the anchor
on that piece of shit.

1943
01:47:01,957 --> 01:47:04,375
The system cuts off its hand
to save its arm.

1944
01:47:04,543 --> 01:47:08,045
The system reorganizes,
entertains new interests.

1945
01:47:08,338 --> 01:47:10,131
Creates new leadership.

1946
01:47:10,132 --> 01:47:13,592
Gentlemen, four more years!
Congratulations!

1947
01:47:13,593 --> 01:47:15,344
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations, everyone!

1948
01:47:16,304 --> 01:47:19,140
As long as the conditions for
the system's existence remained...

1949
01:47:19,141 --> 01:47:20,474
it would resist.

1950
01:47:20,475 --> 01:47:22,393
We all know that Rep. Guaracy...

1951
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:25,729
was elected with money from crime,
with money from the militia.

1952
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:28,482
If you confirm him as
president of this commission...

1953
01:47:28,483 --> 01:47:30,443
you will certify that
you are like him...

1954
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:33,988
crooks dressed up as
representatives of the people...

1955
01:47:33,989 --> 01:47:35,030
I request to speak.

1956
01:47:35,031 --> 01:47:36,615
...the source of injustice!

1957
01:47:36,616 --> 01:47:37,992
Calm down, Representative.

1958
01:47:37,993 --> 01:47:40,077
You do not qualify to be
a congressman.

1959
01:47:40,078 --> 01:47:41,579
- I will not accept...
- Do not quality

1960
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:43,038
your challenging my
competence...

1961
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:45,166
- A representative of crime...
- and that of my colleagues.

1962
01:47:45,167 --> 01:47:47,168
cannot be a representative
of the people!

1963
01:47:47,169 --> 01:47:49,378
I was democratically elected
president of this council.

1964
01:47:49,379 --> 01:47:50,963
- Democratically!
- With the evidence...

1965
01:47:50,964 --> 01:47:52,465
- it's irrefutable!
- I was elected...

1966
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:55,176
and you will have to swallow
your defamatory accusations.

1967
01:47:55,177 --> 01:47:56,594
What I can't swallow is
your criminal record!

1968
01:47:56,595 --> 01:47:58,679
Because I will assume
my duties here...

1969
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:00,306
whether you like or not.

1970
01:48:06,396 --> 01:48:08,063
Now answer me this...

1971
01:48:08,648 --> 01:48:11,108
who do you think sustains
all this?

1972
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:18,574
Yeah... And it costs.
It costs a lot.

1973
01:48:21,077 --> 01:48:23,412
The system is much bigger
than I thought.

1974
01:48:24,039 --> 01:48:26,707
There's a reason dealers,
cops and militias...

1975
01:48:26,708 --> 01:48:29,043
kill so many people in the slums.

1976
01:48:29,169 --> 01:48:31,504
There's a reason
the slums even exist.

1977
01:48:32,130 --> 01:48:34,548
There's a reason for all the
scandals in Brasilia and...

1978
01:48:34,549 --> 01:48:37,301
regardless of administration,
for corruption to continue.

1979
01:48:38,094 --> 01:48:40,971
Change takes a long time.

1980
01:48:42,557 --> 01:48:44,225
The system is fucked up.

1981
01:48:45,185 --> 01:48:47,436
A lot of innocent folks
will keep dying.

1982
01:49:24,432 --> 01:49:25,683
Rafa!

1983
