1
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:36,463
CELL 211

2
00:03:42,153 --> 00:03:44,462
Valuable objects
are checked in here.

3
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:46,988
It avoids stealing
among inmates.

4
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:51,706
They must also turn in cell phones,
belts, blades, razors...

5
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:57,266
Anything the guard considers
dangerous is removed.

6
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:10,623
- Shoelaces too?
- Yeah.

7
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:13,551
You wouldn't believe
what they do with shoelaces.

8
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:20,022
Scary?

9
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,707
Don't worry,
you'll get used to it fast.

10
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,542
You'd better. These bastards
end up getting out,

11
00:04:25,713 --> 00:04:29,069
but you have to spend
your whole fucking life here.

12
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:42,549
You can see it's in fucking shambles.
All they do is patch it up.

13
00:04:42,713 --> 00:04:45,022
We have to wait until
they finish the new center.

14
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:51,105
The yard is obligatory
from 9 AM until lunchtime.

15
00:04:51,273 --> 00:04:54,470
They have a blast out there.
Playing soccer,

16
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,191
dealing stuff...

17
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:58,306
They've got it made.

18
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,069
In any case,
these are the calmer ones.

19
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:06,190
We keep the big shots apart.

20
00:05:08,713 --> 00:05:13,150
We call this patio the strip.
The only air a DSS ever breathes.

21
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:15,982
"Designated for Special
Surveillance."

22
00:05:16,553 --> 00:05:19,021
Murderers, jail breakers,
psychopaths...

23
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:21,352
The best of every home.

24
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:24,308
We used to mix them with
the others in the cell block,

25
00:05:24,473 --> 00:05:28,022
but they'd go berserk over nothing.
They run the show in here.

26
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:31,822
Many have AIDS and years left to
serve, so they don't give a fuck.

27
00:05:31,993 --> 00:05:35,747
Nothing will happen to them
if they cut you, so why hold back?

28
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:38,149
It gives them status
with the other inmates.

29
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,428
Julian, this is Juan, the new guy.
He starts tomorrow.

30
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:44,064
Nice to meet you.
Why is he here?

31
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:46,030
He was bored
so I'm showing him around.

32
00:05:46,193 --> 00:05:48,502
- Don't scare him too much.
- No.

33
00:05:48,673 --> 00:05:51,111
- Bye.
- They're artists.

34
00:05:53,593 --> 00:05:54,708
What is it?

35
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,544
Worse than a musket.
It'll blow a hole right through you.

36
00:05:58,713 --> 00:06:01,705
A piece of pipe
and a spring to fire it.

37
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:04,902
- Can they get powder?
- They can get anything.

38
00:06:05,193 --> 00:06:08,742
If you've got the dough,
you can have sushi delivered.

39
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:10,707
How do they get it in?

40
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,141
Family members

41
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:13,587
during personal visits,

42
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:16,348
other stuff we get for them...

43
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:20,549
To find out what's going on,
get in good with one of these boys.

44
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:23,383
That's how we came across
the musket.

45
00:06:24,953 --> 00:06:27,308
A Colombian named Apache
gave it to us. You'll meet him.

46
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:29,351
We let him do his thing

47
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:31,151
and he tells us what's up.

48
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:34,701
Listen, Juan.

49
00:06:35,873 --> 00:06:37,704
Never trust any of them.

50
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:40,025
Never forget where you are,

51
00:06:40,353 --> 00:06:44,392
and look them in the eye.
Never let them see you're scared.

52
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,825
In the eye, but watch their hands.
They're like magicians.

53
00:06:48,193 --> 00:06:50,627
Nothing here, nothing there...
and presto.

54
00:06:51,313 --> 00:06:53,144
A nice little spoon.

55
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:57,027
- Holy shit!
- Damn!

56
00:06:57,913 --> 00:06:58,948
Fuck!

57
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,347
It broke through the net.

58
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,710
- You all right down there?
- We're fine!

59
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:05,192
Just a close shave!

60
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:06,832
Kid, are you okay?

61
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:10,588
- What's wrong?
- Shit, you're bleeding.

62
00:07:10,873 --> 00:07:13,706
Let's take him to the infirmary.

63
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,105
No, let's take him to cell 211.
It's empty.

64
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:21,831
Why didn't we take him
straight to the infirmary?

65
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:24,222
I don't know.

66
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:30,942
Who could have imagined
what was going to happen?

67
00:07:36,313 --> 00:07:37,826
Hey, Malamadre!

68
00:07:38,513 --> 00:07:39,866
Stroll's over!

69
00:08:11,553 --> 00:08:12,827
Everything okay down there?

70
00:08:13,153 --> 00:08:14,108
We're fine!

71
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,348
Just a close shave!

72
00:08:48,593 --> 00:08:50,311
German, get the doctor.

73
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,466
Juan, stay calm.

74
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,466
Look at me. Juan.

75
00:08:55,713 --> 00:08:56,907
Look at me, kid.

76
00:08:57,553 --> 00:08:58,508
Come on.

77
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:00,227
Look at me, Juan.

78
00:09:00,393 --> 00:09:01,382
Look at me.

79
00:09:04,113 --> 00:09:05,013
Juan...

80
00:09:05,473 --> 00:09:07,862
Juan, look at me.
Don't close your eyes.

81
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:09,472
Don't close your eyes!

82
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,066
They're taking the block!
We have to go!

83
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:12,333
Juan!

84
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:13,866
They'll kill us, come on!

85
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:15,341
We can't leave him!

86
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:16,907
Come on, let's go!

87
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:17,973
Please!

88
00:10:23,473 --> 00:10:25,509
- Is the block sealed?
- Completely.

89
00:10:25,673 --> 00:10:27,743
Even the security area
is locked down.

90
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:29,547
Did everyone get out?

91
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,181
Except Julian,
he was watching the strip.

92
00:10:32,513 --> 00:10:34,105
Okay, we screwed up.

93
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:37,906
We have to locate Malamadre.

94
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,588
I'll bet anything he's behind this.
And he has a hostage.

95
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:44,942
He has 2.

96
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:07,304
Where did you come from?

97
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:12,109
Where did you come from?

98
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:29,623
Fucking shitty prison guards!

99
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:34,826
I'll slit your throats and rip off
your balls, you bastards!

100
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:49,672
Pincho!

101
00:11:51,353 --> 00:11:52,388
Pincho!

102
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:55,069
Pincho, where's Malamadre?

103
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:58,026
Downstairs in the shop
with Tachuela and Apache.

104
00:11:58,153 --> 00:12:02,783
Watch cell 211 for me.
Make sure nobody goes in or out.

105
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:05,666
Nobody!

106
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,747
His name is Juan Oliver.
He's 30 years old, married...

107
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:31,665
He starts work on the first.

108
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,791
- That's tomorrow. What's he doing here?
- He wanted to see how things work.

109
00:12:35,073 --> 00:12:36,586
This will give him an idea.

110
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:39,148
How could he get left inside?

111
00:12:39,313 --> 00:12:41,031
That's what I'd like to know.

112
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:09,786
Come on,

113
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:11,983
let's go.
They're waiting for you.

114
00:13:12,153 --> 00:13:13,053
Who?

115
00:13:13,153 --> 00:13:15,064
Fuck you!

116
00:13:15,353 --> 00:13:17,548
Get outside!

117
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:19,306
Out!

118
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:20,708
Go on!

119
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,112
Get out there!

120
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:26,783
Fucking move it!

121
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:33,068
He's with Pincho and Releches.
Trouble.

122
00:13:33,393 --> 00:13:34,951
Those 2 do anything
Malamadre says.

123
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:37,625
Come on, damn it!

124
00:14:04,673 --> 00:14:06,345
And the cameras in the basement?

125
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:08,546
They've smashed them all.

126
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:09,613
We have to go in.

127
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:11,908
We can't. We have to wait
for the SWAT team.

128
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:14,462
And get them killed,
like Medina 2 years ago?

129
00:14:14,793 --> 00:14:16,704
We have weapons
for emergencies.

130
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:18,631
They're only for self- defense.

131
00:14:18,793 --> 00:14:20,670
Or that of a co- worker.

132
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:22,752
I'm sorry,
but it's either them

133
00:14:22,913 --> 00:14:25,108
- or us.
- What if they take a gun off us?

134
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:27,822
Armando's right.
We have to wait.

135
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:51,942
Malamadre, here's the guy
I told you about.

136
00:15:04,553 --> 00:15:05,827
Where did you come from?

137
00:15:06,353 --> 00:15:07,581
From 211.

138
00:15:09,873 --> 00:15:11,386
That cell was empty.

139
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:13,188
Not anymore.

140
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,222
Why are you bleeding?

141
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:26,147
I got roughed up.

142
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:30,185
So, the guards beat you up
your first day.

143
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:33,626
You must have pissed them off.

144
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:35,383
Well...

145
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:37,426
I do my best.

146
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,183
Hear that,

147
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:41,502
Tachuela?

148
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:44,062
- He did his best.
- They wasted no time.

149
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:53,672
Besides ball- busting,
what are you in for?

150
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,706
First degree homicide.

151
00:15:56,473 --> 00:15:58,304
- How much they give you?
- 19 years.

152
00:15:58,713 --> 00:16:01,273
- You're probably innocent.
- No.

153
00:16:02,353 --> 00:16:04,071
I killed him and I'd do it again.

154
00:16:08,313 --> 00:16:09,541
I don't buy it.

155
00:16:09,873 --> 00:16:10,942
Why not?

156
00:16:12,913 --> 00:16:16,792
Because you don't look like a
killer. You wouldn't hurt a fly.

157
00:16:19,193 --> 00:16:20,911
So you're the prison shrink.

158
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,552
He's pushing his luck.

159
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:40,705
Though I wouldn't mind spending all day
in a white robe handing out valium.

160
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:43,623
One for you, one for me!

161
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:52,310
Utrilla probably had
a lot of fun with him!

162
00:16:52,793 --> 00:16:54,465
Put it out and strip down.

163
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:56,733
What?

164
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:57,947
Take off your clothes.

165
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,142
What for?

166
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:03,702
Mostly because I fucking said so.

167
00:17:10,753 --> 00:17:11,947
Lose the shirt!

168
00:17:12,713 --> 00:17:14,465
Don't be shy!

169
00:17:17,273 --> 00:17:18,308
Go on!

170
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:30,146
Cutie pie!

171
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:31,822
Gorgeous!

172
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:35,947
He's got nothing on!

173
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:37,582
Nothing?

174
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:38,653
Look at that thing!

175
00:17:38,713 --> 00:17:39,907
You're gonna love it here!

176
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:41,373
Hey, Bubba!

177
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:42,786
You've got competition!

178
00:17:48,273 --> 00:17:49,752
Turn around, let them see you.

179
00:17:56,793 --> 00:17:59,387
Somebody's gonna get quite
a mouthful!

180
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:03,866
How many have you strangled,
Superman?

181
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:08,505
Okay, that's enough.
You've all had a little fun.

182
00:18:08,673 --> 00:18:09,662
Back to your business.

183
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:10,948
Everybody out.

184
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:16,946
You'd better watch out. You could win
a beauty contest in here with that.

185
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:20,151
Who would ever undress
in front of all these fags?

186
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:21,662
Apache.

187
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:23,742
Listen up.

188
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:27,146
Have your men get rid of
the surveillance cameras.

189
00:18:27,593 --> 00:18:30,027
- They've seen enough.
- Right.

190
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:47,025
- Where is my clean underwear?
- Did you check the second drawer?

191
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:52,349
I only see the ones
you gave me.

192
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:54,748
So?

193
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:58,101
I can't wear these to work.

194
00:18:58,993 --> 00:19:01,268
Why not?
You said you loved them.

195
00:19:02,553 --> 00:19:04,748
I do, but they're personal.

196
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:08,788
So the gentleman wants to dress fancy
for his first day of work at the prison.

197
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:10,392
Don't make fun of me.

198
00:19:10,793 --> 00:19:13,626
I just think it's funny you're
worried about your underwear.

199
00:19:14,313 --> 00:19:16,190
I want to make a good impression.

200
00:19:16,513 --> 00:19:18,185
Then don't wear anything.

201
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:45,072
You should leave a camera.

202
00:19:52,953 --> 00:19:56,946
So they can see you later on,
when you want to negotiate.

203
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:03,263
Cover it up. That way you control
what they see and what they don't.

204
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:17,672
Not bad.

205
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:21,228
You just earned yourself
some underwear.

206
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:23,746
Get this man

207
00:20:23,913 --> 00:20:26,552
a clean pair of shorts. He can't go
around with his balls hanging out.

208
00:20:26,713 --> 00:20:28,749
Give him yours, jerk- off.
Move!

209
00:20:30,153 --> 00:20:31,472
I'd leave that one.

210
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:33,428
Which one...

211
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:34,988
Calzones?

212
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:37,628
That one.

213
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:43,223
It's Juan and he's with Malamadre.

214
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:06,662
What's he doing?

215
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,742
- Why's he covering the camera?
- Clever bastard!

216
00:21:12,913 --> 00:21:13,868
What is it?

217
00:21:14,593 --> 00:21:17,426
He's tricking them.
They think he's an inmate.

218
00:21:17,593 --> 00:21:20,471
He's trying to tell us
he's fine and he's tricked them.

219
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:30,233
Okay, let's everybody
get this clear.

220
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:35,069
Nobody outside this room must know
that Juan Oliver isn't an inmate.

221
00:21:35,473 --> 00:21:38,670
If word gets out and they hear
something, he's fucked.

222
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,232
The SWAT team is here.

223
00:21:43,113 --> 00:21:45,024
I hope this kid's a good liar.

224
00:21:50,713 --> 00:21:52,305
Recognize this bastard?

225
00:21:56,633 --> 00:21:57,952
Look closely.

226
00:21:59,073 --> 00:22:01,541
Is he the son of a bitch
who beat you up this morning?

227
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:11,751
No, it's not him.

228
00:22:13,393 --> 00:22:16,385
How about that, Julian?
Today is your lucky day.

229
00:22:16,673 --> 00:22:18,709
You were in for
some real punishment.

230
00:22:20,913 --> 00:22:23,143
But I bet you remember
Mueco here.

231
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,789
Mueco sure remembers you

232
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:27,068
and your friends.

233
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:29,105
Went a little far, didn't you?

234
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:32,582
Look at him.
Look at his face,

235
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:34,903
he's a zombie.
He wasn't pretty before,

236
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,864
but now he looks like shit.

237
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,422
Wouldn't you say?

238
00:22:39,073 --> 00:22:39,973
Yes.

239
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:41,053
Yes, what?

240
00:22:41,273 --> 00:22:42,592
Yes, he looks like shit.

241
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:46,063
See? You insult him and
he doesn't even blink.

242
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:47,748
How many of you

243
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:51,110
were in there letting him have it?
4? 5?

244
00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:53,070
You hardly fit in there.

245
00:22:53,353 --> 00:22:54,866
Then 20 days in the hole.

246
00:22:59,993 --> 00:23:00,982
Okay, come on.

247
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:03,185
No hard feelings.

248
00:23:04,873 --> 00:23:06,306
What's done is done.

249
00:23:07,913 --> 00:23:10,188
We'll just leave you two alone
for a little while

250
00:23:10,353 --> 00:23:11,706
so you can talk it over.

251
00:23:12,153 --> 00:23:14,189
Talking about it always helps.
Right, Julian?

252
00:23:14,313 --> 00:23:15,213
Be careful.

253
00:23:15,513 --> 00:23:17,151
If something happens to me,
you get nothing.

254
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:20,229
What do you think I'd get for you?

255
00:23:20,993 --> 00:23:22,346
A plate of spaghetti?

256
00:23:24,553 --> 00:23:25,872
They don't give a shit about you.

257
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:31,828
Don't worry, Julian.

258
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:35,668
I promise you'll have a great time
in the infirmary tonight.

259
00:23:36,433 --> 00:23:37,866
Malamadre's Word.

260
00:23:43,113 --> 00:23:44,068
Let's go.

261
00:23:51,753 --> 00:23:52,902
Hey, Calzones.

262
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:55,111
How are you at literature?

263
00:24:10,113 --> 00:24:11,831
How did you hear about it?

264
00:24:13,193 --> 00:24:14,546
What did they say?

265
00:24:16,073 --> 00:24:18,826
Relax, if something were up,
I'd tell you.

266
00:24:19,393 --> 00:24:20,428
Okay, bye.

267
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:24,303
Shit. They talked about
the prison riot on the radio.

268
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:27,233
How do these people
find out about everything?

269
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:30,631
Some idiot always tells
his family about it.

270
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:32,910
How easy things look
from an office

271
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:35,746
in Madrid. They've decided
to teach them a lesson.

272
00:24:36,553 --> 00:24:38,384
They're afraid they'll riot

273
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:40,145
once a week,
like 10 years ago.

274
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:41,912
What about Julian
and the other guy?

275
00:24:42,073 --> 00:24:43,301
Nobody to negotiate?

276
00:24:43,673 --> 00:24:46,506
They won't negotiate.
The order is to go in

277
00:24:46,673 --> 00:24:48,868
as soon as the SWAT team
sees an opening.

278
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:51,547
Then we should warn them
about the situation.

279
00:24:51,753 --> 00:24:53,072
What situation?

280
00:24:53,313 --> 00:24:54,746
The inmates in cell block 4.

281
00:24:55,473 --> 00:24:57,748
It's empty. They were moved
to other prisons

282
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:58,868
for remodeling.

283
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:00,386
Not all of them.

284
00:25:03,393 --> 00:25:07,306
Jon Arteaga. Alias: Potolo.
Ex- member of cell in San Sebastian.

285
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:10,266
Sentenced to 1,200 years in prison
for 7 murders

286
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:12,708
and a thwarted kidnapping attempt.

287
00:25:12,873 --> 00:25:14,750
Antxon Elorza, "the professor. "

288
00:25:14,953 --> 00:25:17,786
Native of Renteria,
112-year-sentence.

289
00:25:18,313 --> 00:25:22,306
Asier Urriticoechea.
Alias: Txiqui. 30 years old.

290
00:25:22,673 --> 00:25:25,631
Sentenced to 8 years
for throwing a Molotov cocktail,

291
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:26,987
causing severe burns

292
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:30,464
to a member of the Basque police...

293
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:31,748
I'm not accusing anyone.

294
00:25:31,873 --> 00:25:35,912
What I'm saying is the ETA story
wasn't us, you understand?

295
00:25:37,793 --> 00:25:39,306
Hey, cut it out!

296
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:42,903
Trying to comb your way
out of here?

297
00:25:44,033 --> 00:25:46,991
What should I do,
sit around waiting to get killed?

298
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:49,386
Nobody's going to get killed.

299
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:50,946
Hey, knock it off.

300
00:25:51,513 --> 00:25:53,868
Quit speaking Basque.
We don't want any secrets.

301
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:56,024
Gentlemen, everybody out.

302
00:25:57,873 --> 00:25:58,942
Move it!

303
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:30,468
What's he saying?

304
00:26:31,313 --> 00:26:35,022
That he has 3 hostages
better than any guard.

305
00:26:35,873 --> 00:26:38,467
He wants us to know
he's calling the shots.

306
00:26:38,713 --> 00:26:41,546
Ernesto Almansa,
federal envoy sent to negotiate.

307
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:44,864
Jose Roca, I'm the warden.
We gave them a walkie-talkie

308
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:47,905
but they still haven't tried
to contact us.

309
00:26:49,913 --> 00:26:52,905
Staging all this with the ETA
members in the middle...

310
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:57,149
He's trying to win over
his audience.

311
00:26:58,473 --> 00:27:01,624
How long have we complained
to anyone who'd listen?

312
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:04,263
For years! To judges,

313
00:27:04,433 --> 00:27:08,665
the district attorney, newspapers...
And what did we get?

314
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:11,063
Nothing but bullshit!
A bunch of crap!

315
00:27:11,633 --> 00:27:14,431
But now, with our friends
from the north,

316
00:27:14,873 --> 00:27:16,670
they're going to listen to us.

317
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,107
But for real.

318
00:27:18,313 --> 00:27:20,702
Because this time we've got them
by the balls!

319
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:28,425
By the balls!

320
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,670
This was 10 years ago,
in Puerto de Santa Maria.

321
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,789
They should have fried
the son of a bitch.

322
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:21,221
He has nothing to lose.
He knows he'll never get out.

323
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:24,023
So he won't be easy to reason with.

324
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:27,745
The ETA members were transferred to
that cell block yesterday, the same day

325
00:28:27,913 --> 00:28:30,268
they were supposed to leave.
This is no coincidence.

326
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:32,551
- What do you mean?
- They must have had

327
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:36,023
this information. And if they had
it, it had to come from somewhere.

328
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:39,903
This isn't the time
to look for those responsible.

329
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:43,431
We're about to play a game of poker
with a murderer.

330
00:28:43,593 --> 00:28:44,912
We'll mark the cards, of course.

331
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:48,304
I'd like to make sure he won't know
my next move beforehand.

332
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:49,373
Conejo.

333
00:28:50,513 --> 00:28:52,504
Conejo was in the cell
next to Malamadre.

334
00:28:52,753 --> 00:28:55,665
Conejo's in the infirmary.
He was having cramps.

335
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:59,463
Let me talk to him.
I'll find out who tipped them off.

336
00:29:04,353 --> 00:29:07,584
In this situation,
we have no choice but to try.

337
00:29:11,673 --> 00:29:12,788
Utrilla.

338
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:16,103
The cure better not be worse
than the illness.

339
00:29:18,353 --> 00:29:19,342
By the way,

340
00:29:19,513 --> 00:29:21,151
has Juan's wife been notified?

341
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:42,661
- Hi.
- Hi.

342
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,103
One kilo of tomatoes, please.

343
00:29:46,873 --> 00:29:48,591
"Demands."

344
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:50,661
See that, Tachuela?

345
00:29:52,513 --> 00:29:53,502
Very good.

346
00:29:53,673 --> 00:29:55,231
Did you see his handwriting?

347
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:59,352
He writes better than my last lawyer,
I never understood a word he wrote.

348
00:29:59,513 --> 00:30:01,151
Right, since you can't read...

349
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:02,905
I read fucking great.

350
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:07,352
Writing is the problem.

351
00:30:07,513 --> 00:30:09,708
It's like everything,
you have to do it every day...

352
00:30:10,073 --> 00:30:11,870
Right, that must be it.

353
00:30:12,953 --> 00:30:15,069
I can tell you're great at it.

354
00:30:15,993 --> 00:30:17,904
You must work in a bank
or an office or something.

355
00:30:18,593 --> 00:30:20,265
I was studying to be
a civil servant.

356
00:30:20,473 --> 00:30:21,667
What kind? A cop?

357
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:25,147
Post office.

358
00:30:26,513 --> 00:30:27,468
Right.

359
00:30:29,593 --> 00:30:31,504
And suddenly you kill some fucker

360
00:30:31,673 --> 00:30:33,072
and it all goes to hell.

361
00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:37,065
- All those letters and telegrams...
- Come on, Malamadre.

362
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:38,632
Get to it.

363
00:30:41,353 --> 00:30:43,389
First of all, that supervisor.

364
00:30:43,553 --> 00:30:44,906
What's that fucker's name?

365
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:46,552
Benigno.

366
00:30:46,873 --> 00:30:50,627
No, Maligno.
His name is Maligno.

367
00:30:51,873 --> 00:30:52,988
Get rid of him.

368
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:56,543
We're sick of him giving his blessing
to all the crap they do to us.

369
00:30:57,473 --> 00:31:00,749
You can't keep a man isolated
for 20 days straight

370
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:04,105
in a fucking hole with no light,
nobody to talk to...

371
00:31:04,273 --> 00:31:08,949
You're even grateful
when they come and beat on you.

372
00:31:09,073 --> 00:31:11,268
At least you can yell at somebody.

373
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:12,548
Personal visits.

374
00:31:13,273 --> 00:31:15,184
Every 2 weeks,
not whenever they feel like it.

375
00:31:15,393 --> 00:31:17,224
They pull the plug on you here

376
00:31:17,393 --> 00:31:19,111
and nobody says a damn thing.

377
00:31:21,153 --> 00:31:24,031
You wanna keep giving it
to your wife, don't you?

378
00:31:25,793 --> 00:31:27,784
Or don't you feel like it
anymore?

379
00:31:30,713 --> 00:31:33,386
What happened, you catch her
with someone and lose your head?

380
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:35,947
You must have been hot.

381
00:31:36,113 --> 00:31:38,581
Otherwise I can't picture you
using a knife.

382
00:31:39,313 --> 00:31:40,507
It wasn't a knife.

383
00:31:41,793 --> 00:31:44,068
And it had nothing to do
with my wife.

384
00:31:47,953 --> 00:31:49,068
The doctor.

385
00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:53,028
No more treating people
through bars. No wonder

386
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:55,468
they mistake cancer for diarrhea.

387
00:31:56,153 --> 00:31:57,666
Like Morao.

388
00:31:57,873 --> 00:32:01,263
Guy was screaming all day long
his head

389
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:03,867
was bursting,
his head was bursting...

390
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:06,911
In the end he had a tumor
the size of a kiwi.

391
00:32:07,313 --> 00:32:09,747
They took it out
after he was already dead.

392
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:13,706
They found him at your place,
cell 211.

393
00:32:16,193 --> 00:32:18,343
Sitting there with his veins open

394
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:21,671
because nobody gave a fuck.

395
00:32:22,793 --> 00:32:23,942
Morao...

396
00:32:26,193 --> 00:32:30,391
This is Ernesto Almansa, the national
envoy sent to negotiate. Who is this?

397
00:32:30,553 --> 00:32:31,872
Felipe Gonzalez.

398
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,628
You know the drill. No bullshit,
let's get this over with.

399
00:32:36,313 --> 00:32:39,544
That's what we want. The sooner this
is over, the easier for everyone.

400
00:32:40,073 --> 00:32:41,904
Can we speak in person?

401
00:32:42,113 --> 00:32:43,512
You know where to find us.

402
00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:47,512
We should meet
in the security zone.

403
00:32:47,913 --> 00:32:51,303
No, no. None of that crap.
You wanna talk, come on in.

404
00:32:52,713 --> 00:32:54,112
All right.

405
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:58,187
But uncover the camera
so they can see me from outside.

406
00:32:58,473 --> 00:33:00,464
What, don't you trust us?

407
00:33:00,633 --> 00:33:03,670
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
We know what respect means.

408
00:33:04,593 --> 00:33:06,788
Sorry, but without the camera
there's no way.

409
00:33:07,513 --> 00:33:09,549
Okay, you want the camera,
you got it.

410
00:33:10,953 --> 00:33:12,625
How about in 15 minutes?

411
00:33:13,713 --> 00:33:15,988
Fine by me.
I wasn't going anywhere.

412
00:33:23,353 --> 00:33:24,752
Turn it towards the block.

413
00:33:32,193 --> 00:33:34,502
That's Apache.
He controls the Colombians.

414
00:33:34,673 --> 00:33:37,141
The other one is Tachuela,
Malamadre's right hand.

415
00:33:37,593 --> 00:33:40,107
If he's watching that door,
there's a reason.

416
00:33:40,313 --> 00:33:43,544
The hostages must be in there,
but we have to confirm it.

417
00:33:54,273 --> 00:33:55,501
What a bastard.

418
00:33:56,913 --> 00:33:58,426
You're head over heels.

419
00:33:59,273 --> 00:34:01,264
She's got you by the balls.
What's her name?

420
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,472
Elena. Her name is Elena.

421
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:05,584
Elena. Is she hot?

422
00:34:06,073 --> 00:34:09,031
I'm just asking,
a friend's wife is sacred to me.

423
00:34:09,393 --> 00:34:11,384
She's pregnant.
We're having a kid.

424
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:13,027
Damn, that sucks!

425
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:16,465
I mean getting put in jail,
not having a kid.

426
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,667
We have to be careful.

427
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:27,066
You sure the new guy
can be trusted?

428
00:34:28,793 --> 00:34:30,112
Can anybody?

429
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:31,422
People we know.

430
00:34:32,873 --> 00:34:34,784
You guys, us...

431
00:34:37,073 --> 00:34:38,711
He only just got here.

432
00:34:42,273 --> 00:34:43,422
He was a dealer.

433
00:34:46,193 --> 00:34:47,945
The guy I killed.

434
00:34:48,673 --> 00:34:49,992
He gave my brother

435
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:53,145
some bad shit
and it did him in.

436
00:34:53,553 --> 00:34:55,066
And you went after him.

437
00:34:58,313 --> 00:35:00,031
That takes guts.

438
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:02,308
Fucking drugs.

439
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:06,669
When someone new comes along,

440
00:35:07,193 --> 00:35:08,990
you have to keep an eye on him.

441
00:35:09,113 --> 00:35:11,149
That's why Malamadre
is always with him.

442
00:35:11,313 --> 00:35:12,507
He writes good.

443
00:35:15,033 --> 00:35:16,261
That's great.

444
00:35:16,553 --> 00:35:19,226
He can write letters
to old ladies for us.

445
00:35:20,873 --> 00:35:23,626
If you want,
I can take a little stroll

446
00:35:23,793 --> 00:35:25,511
and have him checked out.

447
00:35:27,553 --> 00:35:28,588
Not a bad idea.

448
00:35:39,793 --> 00:35:40,693
Okay.

449
00:35:40,713 --> 00:35:43,181
It's showtime.
Come on.

450
00:35:52,513 --> 00:35:55,949
Okay, Calzones. Frisk the gentleman
and let's get to it.

451
00:36:03,513 --> 00:36:06,107
You've heard by now
this isn't my first riot,

452
00:36:06,553 --> 00:36:08,509
so let's skip the bullshit,
okay?

453
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:09,512
Fine with me.

454
00:36:09,513 --> 00:36:10,832
They're in the bathroom.

455
00:36:12,393 --> 00:36:13,428
He's clean.

456
00:36:22,273 --> 00:36:23,342
Hey, Daddy!

457
00:36:24,713 --> 00:36:27,022
They couldn't send
anybody smaller?

458
00:36:27,593 --> 00:36:30,232
How about it, Calzones?
He's like that song.

459
00:36:30,393 --> 00:36:34,671
I married a dwarf
for a laugh...

460
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:36,107
Would you rather talk
to somebody else?

461
00:36:36,393 --> 00:36:38,190
I was only joking, little man.

462
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:40,192
What are your demands?

463
00:36:40,673 --> 00:36:41,822
Give him the paper.

464
00:36:45,513 --> 00:36:47,310
It's all there,
in pretty handwriting.

465
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:49,625
I'll have to talk to the Ministry.

466
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:51,471
Go ahead, talk to whoever you want.

467
00:36:51,633 --> 00:36:53,430
Keep the list, it's for you.

468
00:36:53,593 --> 00:36:56,266
I have to see the hostages
to make sure they're okay.

469
00:36:56,793 --> 00:37:01,105
Sorry, but they're taking a nap
and I'm not waking them up.

470
00:37:01,593 --> 00:37:03,584
Don't worry,
we're treating them great.

471
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:05,152
- But...
- What did I say?

472
00:37:05,713 --> 00:37:09,467
Didn't we agree no bullshit?
Take the list, turn around

473
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:12,352
and don't come back without
something nice to say.

474
00:37:12,513 --> 00:37:13,502
Okay?

475
00:37:14,473 --> 00:37:15,462
Scram.

476
00:37:17,073 --> 00:37:19,507
Hold on a second.
I have a couple errands for you.

477
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,824
You like seafood?

478
00:37:23,873 --> 00:37:25,829
We want shrimp for everybody.

479
00:37:27,033 --> 00:37:30,105
Bring sandwiches, fruit
and 40 kilos of shrimp.

480
00:37:30,713 --> 00:37:34,991
And 100 grams of coke and another 100
grams of speed, to keep everyone awake.

481
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:39,103
I can tell by your face
we're gonna be here for a while.

482
00:37:39,873 --> 00:37:41,147
I'll see what I can do.

483
00:37:42,153 --> 00:37:43,552
"I'll see what I can do."

484
00:37:44,913 --> 00:37:49,464
You see, Calzones? They always say
that. "I'll see what I can do."

485
00:37:49,633 --> 00:37:52,750
They never talk straight,
and then people get hurt.

486
00:37:52,913 --> 00:37:54,107
You want someone to get hurt?

487
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,905
Certainly not.

488
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:02,982
Hey, half- pint.

489
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,911
Before anything,
I want this man to talk to his wife.

490
00:38:11,193 --> 00:38:12,103
To his wife?

491
00:38:12,273 --> 00:38:13,831
Yeah, she's pregnant
and he's worried.

492
00:38:14,193 --> 00:38:15,865
Do you have to talk
to the Ministry for that?

493
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,863
Don't look at me like that.
It's what you wanted.

494
00:38:21,393 --> 00:38:23,111
He can come with me
and use the phone.

495
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:30,428
Okay.

496
00:38:32,433 --> 00:38:34,344
But if anything happens to
my friend,

497
00:38:34,593 --> 00:38:36,345
we'll let the bulls run loose.

498
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:38,704
Don't worry,
nothing will happen to him.

499
00:38:38,873 --> 00:38:39,783
Let's go.

500
00:38:46,953 --> 00:38:48,864
He's leaving with him.
He did it.

501
00:38:49,713 --> 00:38:50,702
Open the door.

502
00:38:59,073 --> 00:39:00,392
Fuck!

503
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:02,669
- Fuck!
- Something happened in the block.

504
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:03,912
Close the door.

505
00:39:03,913 --> 00:39:04,982
Close the door!

506
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:07,463
Turn the camera.

507
00:39:07,633 --> 00:39:08,907
We can't lose sight of them.

508
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:10,906
Do it, damn it!

509
00:39:11,113 --> 00:39:12,671
Go see what the fuck is going on.

510
00:39:14,713 --> 00:39:15,828
Move it!

511
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:17,822
If this is a trick...

512
00:39:19,553 --> 00:39:20,453
Follow him.

513
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:25,661
Son of a bitch.

514
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:28,742
You have my word
we're not behind this.

515
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,870
- What's going on?
- How should I know?

516
00:39:37,553 --> 00:39:39,350
It's okay!

517
00:39:40,073 --> 00:39:41,665
It's okay!

518
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:42,948
What are they looking at?

519
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:44,512
They're looking up.
Raise it.

520
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:48,672
- That stupid Elvis killed Sebas.
- So what?

521
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:51,431
I warned him!

522
00:39:51,593 --> 00:39:52,503
Fucker!

523
00:39:52,673 --> 00:39:55,141
Busting my balls all the time.
He asked for it.

524
00:39:57,193 --> 00:39:58,103
That guy looks dead.

525
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,871
Yeah, he's dead.

526
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:04,752
Is he one of the hostages?

527
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:07,149
Get him inside!
Don't let them see him!

528
00:40:07,313 --> 00:40:10,623
Get him inside, damn it!
Get him inside!

529
00:40:17,473 --> 00:40:18,462
Is that him?

530
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:19,907
It could be.

531
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:21,625
We have to go in.

532
00:40:22,313 --> 00:40:24,144
Attention all units,
we're going in.

533
00:40:33,193 --> 00:40:35,229
What the fuck are they doing?

534
00:40:38,113 --> 00:40:39,341
We have to get them out there!

535
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:43,908
Malamadre's the only one
who gives orders around here!

536
00:40:44,073 --> 00:40:45,904
Who the fuck do you think
told me to?

537
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,148
4 and we go in.

538
00:40:49,873 --> 00:40:50,862
4...

539
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,951
- They're coming in!
- Put them in front of the camera!

540
00:40:54,113 --> 00:40:55,671
The SWAT team!

541
00:40:56,073 --> 00:40:56,973
3...

542
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:02,546
- Move!
- The SWAT team's coming in!

543
00:41:05,473 --> 00:41:06,373
2...

544
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:17,189
- 1...
- There they are.

545
00:41:17,353 --> 00:41:18,672
The hostages are in the block!

546
00:41:21,673 --> 00:41:23,106
Abort, abort!

547
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:29,468
Remain calm.

548
00:41:29,873 --> 00:41:31,591
The operation has been aborted.

549
00:41:32,553 --> 00:41:34,225
Jesus fucking Christ.

550
00:41:34,393 --> 00:41:35,712
Remain calm.

551
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:36,988
They're not coming in!

552
00:42:13,473 --> 00:42:15,031
Let's go! Let's go!

553
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,824
Calzones!

554
00:42:23,393 --> 00:42:26,624
It worked out this time, but act
alone again and I'll crush you.

555
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:36,385
We've received conflicting reports,
but the deceased could be

556
00:42:36,553 --> 00:42:38,271
one of the ETA members

557
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:42,631
being held hostage since this
morning. The news has sparked

558
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:45,102
an immediate reaction
in several prisons

559
00:42:45,273 --> 00:42:49,232
where members of the terrorist group
are more numerous.

560
00:42:49,353 --> 00:42:51,662
Of course you can quote me.
The 3 hostages are alive.

561
00:42:52,113 --> 00:42:53,944
I don't know
where you heard that,

562
00:42:54,073 --> 00:42:55,472
but it's completely false.

563
00:42:55,633 --> 00:42:58,989
... the Basque government
has expressed concern.

564
00:42:59,473 --> 00:43:01,668
More and more family members

565
00:43:01,873 --> 00:43:05,946
and onlookers have gathered outside
the prison to confirm reports

566
00:43:06,113 --> 00:43:09,662
that one inmate has died and several
others have been injured.

567
00:43:10,153 --> 00:43:14,624
The only new information we have is
an ambulance entered 5 minutes ago

568
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:16,909
but that's all we know.

569
00:43:26,913 --> 00:43:28,266
You son of a bitch!

570
00:43:28,793 --> 00:43:30,112
You're trying to kill me!

571
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:32,582
How did Malamadre find out about
the members of ETA? Who told him?

572
00:43:32,753 --> 00:43:33,663
Who?

573
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,705
He locked himself
in there with him.

574
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:39,711
- How long ago?
- Half an hour, but he's in bad shape.

575
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:42,028
He wouldn't let me give him
anything for the pain.

576
00:43:42,193 --> 00:43:43,945
There's an ambulance
waiting outside.

577
00:43:44,113 --> 00:43:45,626
Don't worry,
I'll talk to him.

578
00:43:45,793 --> 00:43:47,067
If he goes too far...

579
00:43:52,033 --> 00:43:53,102
Give me something!

580
00:43:53,273 --> 00:43:54,752
I can't take it anymore!

581
00:43:54,913 --> 00:43:55,982
I'm dying!

582
00:43:56,153 --> 00:43:57,905
I don't care if you burst
right here!

583
00:43:58,513 --> 00:44:01,949
Tell me or we'll wait
until you're pissing rocks!

584
00:44:02,193 --> 00:44:03,865
That's enough,
you're going to kill him.

585
00:44:04,513 --> 00:44:05,912
We can hear him outside.

586
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:07,905
Besides, this is no way

587
00:44:08,073 --> 00:44:09,062
to treat a human being.

588
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:10,268
What?

589
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:11,902
It isn't?

590
00:44:13,353 --> 00:44:17,551
Now that you came in playing good
cop, it'll be twice as hard

591
00:44:17,713 --> 00:44:18,941
to make him talk.

592
00:44:19,193 --> 00:44:20,911
Twice as hard, you hear me?

593
00:44:27,153 --> 00:44:28,666
Talk, motherfucker!

594
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:29,733
Talk!

595
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,868
Talk!

596
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:33,588
Borrego.

597
00:44:34,353 --> 00:44:35,991
Borrego told him.

598
00:44:36,313 --> 00:44:37,348
The barber?

599
00:44:37,873 --> 00:44:38,783
Yeah.

600
00:44:39,153 --> 00:44:40,472
He hears about everything.

601
00:44:40,633 --> 00:44:42,385
He cuts everybody's hair.

602
00:44:45,993 --> 00:44:47,790
Give him an aspirin,
he earned it.

603
00:44:54,393 --> 00:44:57,112
You should know I'm reporting this.
I'm sorry,

604
00:44:57,273 --> 00:44:59,389
- but I can't cover it up.
- You can't?

605
00:44:59,553 --> 00:45:00,906
Then why didn't you stop me?

606
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,301
I told you to stop.

607
00:45:02,913 --> 00:45:04,983
Did that make you feel better?

608
00:45:06,433 --> 00:45:09,470
Nice having me around when someone
has to stand up to these fuckers.

609
00:45:11,273 --> 00:45:12,342
Armando.

610
00:45:12,873 --> 00:45:15,990
A call for you in the warden's
office. It's urgent.

611
00:45:17,473 --> 00:45:19,429
Go on, don't keep them waiting.

612
00:45:30,433 --> 00:45:31,333
Elena?

613
00:45:31,393 --> 00:45:33,543
- Yes.
- This is Armando,

614
00:45:33,713 --> 00:45:35,988
I work with your husband.
Well, we met this morning.

615
00:45:36,153 --> 00:45:39,463
I'm sorry, but Juan can't talk
right now. He's in another block.

616
00:45:39,593 --> 00:45:42,585
I just saw the news. They say
there's a riot and people have died.

617
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,341
Don't believe the TV,
they always exaggerate.

618
00:45:45,753 --> 00:45:49,029
There was trouble, but only in one
block and it's completely isolated.

619
00:45:49,953 --> 00:45:51,022
By the way,

620
00:45:51,153 --> 00:45:53,986
Juan said you're pregnant.
How far along?

621
00:45:54,633 --> 00:45:55,827
6 months.

622
00:45:57,913 --> 00:46:00,507
Listen, he's not answering
his cell phone.

623
00:46:00,713 --> 00:46:02,988
He must have checked it in.

624
00:46:03,273 --> 00:46:06,583
They don't allow cell phones
for safety reasons.

625
00:46:07,153 --> 00:46:08,552
Tell her to go home.

626
00:46:09,553 --> 00:46:10,986
Look, I have an idea.

627
00:46:11,873 --> 00:46:15,388
Why don't you go home and when I see
Juan I'll tell him to meet you there.

628
00:46:15,553 --> 00:46:17,987
- That you're worried. Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

629
00:46:18,953 --> 00:46:21,672
Juan said you're getting
the apartment ready. That's great.

630
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:30,065
Anyway, take care. And don't worry,
not every day is like this.

631
00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:33,262
- Talk to you later.
- Okay, bye.

632
00:46:34,473 --> 00:46:36,065
Good. Very good.

633
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:44,871
When she gets home the police
will notify her. It's for the best.

634
00:47:16,073 --> 00:47:18,667
See? I was right.
They love you guys.

635
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:22,392
And I thought they'd take
the shrimp thing as a joke...

636
00:47:25,393 --> 00:47:28,226
If you want to laugh,
go laugh with the txakurras.

637
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:30,310
Nobody laughs at me.

638
00:47:31,673 --> 00:47:34,949
Relax, we all know
you're the big murderer here.

639
00:47:36,313 --> 00:47:38,781
Compared to you,
we're all amateurs.

640
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:41,946
Though you always kill
from a distance.

641
00:47:42,713 --> 00:47:44,112
Boom and that's that.

642
00:47:44,393 --> 00:47:46,065
I bet you're pretty courageous.

643
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:48,701
I have balls enough
to gut you right here.

644
00:47:48,873 --> 00:47:51,706
If any one of you
lays a finger on us,

645
00:47:51,873 --> 00:47:53,591
kiss your whole family goodbye.

646
00:47:54,073 --> 00:47:55,904
You might be doing me a favor.

647
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:59,145
My only family is my cousin in
La Corua and he's a fucking prick.

648
00:48:02,953 --> 00:48:04,306
Let's take it easy.

649
00:48:07,673 --> 00:48:10,745
This will be over in a few hours
and we can go our own ways.

650
00:48:10,993 --> 00:48:13,302
You fight your war
and we'll fight ours.

651
00:48:13,793 --> 00:48:15,545
What if they don't meet
your demands?

652
00:48:17,033 --> 00:48:18,148
I don't know.

653
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:21,349
What would you do
if you were me?

654
00:48:28,153 --> 00:48:32,146
Stay with me. You don't have
to go in until tomorrow.

655
00:48:32,313 --> 00:48:33,302
I already told you.

656
00:48:34,153 --> 00:48:35,950
I want to make an impression.

657
00:48:36,273 --> 00:48:38,309
Show them someone responsible,

658
00:48:38,793 --> 00:48:41,785
with his home, his wife,
his child...

659
00:48:43,073 --> 00:48:44,188
Well, almost.

660
00:48:46,033 --> 00:48:47,068
Well.

661
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:48,902
Too bad.

662
00:48:58,713 --> 00:49:00,704
- What are you doing?
- Me? Nothing.

663
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:02,707
Weren't you leaving?

664
00:49:04,433 --> 00:49:05,343
Yeah.

665
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:08,065
But I can go in later.

666
00:49:08,233 --> 00:49:09,586
I don't have to clock in.

667
00:49:14,513 --> 00:49:16,390
PRISON

668
00:49:22,473 --> 00:49:23,952
Fucking Tachuela!

669
00:49:24,673 --> 00:49:26,072
Always the same.

670
00:49:29,673 --> 00:49:31,868
The one from the trial,

671
00:49:32,033 --> 00:49:33,432
when we busted out...

672
00:49:33,593 --> 00:49:34,662
Remember how hot she was?

673
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:35,982
She was amazing.

674
00:49:36,153 --> 00:49:39,941
She had huge tits,
in the middle of the courtroom,

675
00:49:40,113 --> 00:49:41,228
his knife to her throat...

676
00:49:41,393 --> 00:49:43,623
"Oh, no! I'm going to faint!"

677
00:49:43,793 --> 00:49:45,511
And this homo says,
"If you faint,

678
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:46,702
I'll cut you!"

679
00:49:48,233 --> 00:49:50,588
And she says,
"No, no, I won't faint!"

680
00:49:52,633 --> 00:49:54,066
I looked over and thought,

681
00:49:54,233 --> 00:49:55,825
"He's feeling her up!"

682
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,472
He was more worried about

683
00:49:57,633 --> 00:50:00,067
feeling her tits
than escaping from prison.

684
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:02,224
Fucking lawyer!

685
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,112
What a son of a bitch.

686
00:50:09,753 --> 00:50:11,345
God damn it.

687
00:50:12,873 --> 00:50:15,751
6 months of vacation
we had there.

688
00:50:16,473 --> 00:50:17,667
You had longer,

689
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:19,744
they didn't catch you
for a year.

690
00:50:19,913 --> 00:50:22,029
11 months and 3 days.

691
00:50:22,513 --> 00:50:25,232
Know what I remember most
about those 6 months?

692
00:50:27,913 --> 00:50:31,110
Drinking a beer on the beach
at La Victoria, in Cadiz.

693
00:50:31,993 --> 00:50:33,221
The place was nothing special.

694
00:50:33,393 --> 00:50:35,349
More crowded than Japan.

695
00:50:38,073 --> 00:50:39,711
But just sitting there,

696
00:50:41,553 --> 00:50:42,622
so relaxed,

697
00:50:44,233 --> 00:50:45,586
with my beer...

698
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,067
and the sea...

699
00:51:13,393 --> 00:51:15,748
- How are things down here?
- Fine.

700
00:51:16,313 --> 00:51:18,668
Living it up, Malamadre.

701
00:51:19,593 --> 00:51:22,312
- You've never been better.
- That's right.

702
00:51:22,473 --> 00:51:24,429
The shrimp was a great idea.

703
00:51:25,033 --> 00:51:25,933
Here you go.

704
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:29,593
Eat. I don't want you
to go without.

705
00:51:30,513 --> 00:51:31,787
You're kidding, right?

706
00:51:37,793 --> 00:51:39,909
I didn't say talk,
I said eat.

707
00:51:42,193 --> 00:51:46,266
Know the joke about the 2 guys from
Bilbao who went looking for mushrooms?

708
00:51:46,433 --> 00:51:47,333
No.

709
00:51:47,353 --> 00:51:50,470
One of them says,
"Look, Txomin. I found a Rolex."

710
00:51:50,673 --> 00:51:54,109
The other one says, "Are we looking
for Rolexes or mushrooms?"

711
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:59,749
Just like this fucking idiot
killing Sebas during the riot.

712
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:01,511
What's your fucking problem?

713
00:52:01,633 --> 00:52:04,864
You think we set all this up so you
could do whatever you fucking wanted?

714
00:52:05,033 --> 00:52:06,705
I should fucking kill you!

715
00:52:08,473 --> 00:52:11,749
You almost screwed this up
for everybody, you dumbshit!

716
00:52:12,113 --> 00:52:13,785
That's enough,
he got the point.

717
00:52:13,953 --> 00:52:16,387
You think so?
He's pretty damn stupid.

718
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:20,747
Did you get the point
or you want dessert?

719
00:52:21,673 --> 00:52:22,662
I got it.

720
00:52:25,873 --> 00:52:26,908
I got it.

721
00:52:28,233 --> 00:52:29,382
I'm glad.

722
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,942
They're talking about us
in English!

723
00:52:47,673 --> 00:52:48,583
It's Juan.

724
00:52:49,073 --> 00:52:50,711
Juan Oliver, you hear me?

725
00:52:52,033 --> 00:52:53,785
Check it out!

726
00:52:54,153 --> 00:52:56,189
Zamora.
They're talking in English.

727
00:52:58,953 --> 00:53:00,545
What are they saying?

728
00:53:01,353 --> 00:53:05,505
That they're the first terrorists
ever taken hostage in Spain.

729
00:53:06,753 --> 00:53:10,382
You were right, Malamadre.
We sure fucked them good!

730
00:53:11,513 --> 00:53:14,346
What are they saying?
What?

731
00:53:17,273 --> 00:53:20,151
Apparently they've had riots
in other prisons.

732
00:53:26,873 --> 00:53:30,149
Malamadre,
I'm gonna take the TV outside.

733
00:53:30,313 --> 00:53:31,213
Break the lock.

734
00:53:32,233 --> 00:53:34,508
Somebody answer,
I don't have time for this.

735
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:36,106
The hostages are in 219,

736
00:53:36,273 --> 00:53:38,912
you hear me? In 219,
but I don't know for how long.

737
00:53:39,113 --> 00:53:40,148
They're moving them constantly.

738
00:53:40,953 --> 00:53:43,387
- This is Almansa.
- Finally!

739
00:53:44,073 --> 00:53:45,108
Come on.

740
00:53:45,313 --> 00:53:47,588
Be careful,

741
00:53:47,753 --> 00:53:48,708
it's glass!

742
00:53:48,873 --> 00:53:51,103
Be careful!

743
00:53:51,313 --> 00:53:53,463
Over there, in the corner.

744
00:53:54,393 --> 00:53:55,792
Have you talked to Elena?

745
00:53:55,913 --> 00:53:57,904
Did you tell her not to worry,
I'm okay?

746
00:53:59,593 --> 00:54:02,505
Yeah, she's fine.
She's proud of what you're doing.

747
00:54:07,753 --> 00:54:09,186
What are they saying?

748
00:54:09,313 --> 00:54:12,669
They're talking about all the people
killed by ETA.

749
00:54:14,433 --> 00:54:16,151
LIVE FROM ZAMORA

750
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,748
That's my sister!
That's Maria, my sister!

751
00:54:25,673 --> 00:54:26,867
That's my sister!

752
00:54:27,033 --> 00:54:28,830
- That's Susi!
- Give me the remote.

753
00:54:32,113 --> 00:54:33,592
Something's gonna happen.

754
00:54:33,753 --> 00:54:36,984
People are nervous.
Something's gonna happen.

755
00:54:37,153 --> 00:54:40,065
What about the injured people?
They won't tell us anything.

756
00:54:40,313 --> 00:54:42,349
This will be a bloodbath if you
come in. What are you going to do?

757
00:54:44,113 --> 00:54:45,307
I can't tell you that.

758
00:54:47,193 --> 00:54:49,388
My life is at stake
and you can't tell me?

759
00:54:50,273 --> 00:54:53,071
We're not allowed
to endanger the ETA members.

760
00:54:53,273 --> 00:54:55,833
That's the agreement
with the Basque government.

761
00:54:56,233 --> 00:54:57,712
Let's burn it down!

762
00:54:57,913 --> 00:54:59,505
Let's burn it down!

763
00:55:01,233 --> 00:55:02,268
Where's the walkie?

764
00:55:07,793 --> 00:55:12,184
They're preparing an entry, but only
if the ETA members are in danger.

765
00:55:12,353 --> 00:55:13,422
What about me?

766
00:55:14,153 --> 00:55:16,713
Why not just meet their demands
and get it over with?

767
00:55:16,873 --> 00:55:17,828
It's not that easy, Juan.

768
00:55:17,993 --> 00:55:20,985
If we give in now, tomorrow
this could happen everywhere.

769
00:55:21,273 --> 00:55:22,501
But I'm in here today!

770
00:55:22,673 --> 00:55:24,186
Can't you just give them
something

771
00:55:24,353 --> 00:55:26,344
and get me the fuck out of here?

772
00:55:39,993 --> 00:55:41,711
- Well?
- It's not there.

773
00:55:41,873 --> 00:55:43,670
Son of a bitch!

774
00:55:45,553 --> 00:55:48,829
If one of these bastards took it,
I'll fucking kill him.

775
00:55:51,633 --> 00:55:53,544
Be careful,
someone will steal it.

776
00:55:54,993 --> 00:55:56,551
You left it on the table.

777
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:17,422
Yes?

778
00:56:24,633 --> 00:56:26,589
I'm looking for Juan Oliver.

779
00:56:26,713 --> 00:56:27,592
Who?

780
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:28,662
Juan Oliver.

781
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:30,824
- Is he an inmate?
- No, he works here.

782
00:56:30,993 --> 00:56:34,144
Actually he starts tomorrow
but he came in today.

783
00:56:35,073 --> 00:56:38,463
- I talked to somebody named Armando.
- Armando Nieto?

784
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:41,227
- I don't know his last name.
- Hold on a minute.

785
00:56:42,313 --> 00:56:43,382
Who died?

786
00:56:43,553 --> 00:56:46,511
On TV they said somebody
got killed!

787
00:56:46,673 --> 00:56:47,788
What's his name?

788
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:52,831
- We need to know!
- Where's my brother?

789
00:56:59,793 --> 00:57:02,432
Malamadre has us all
in trouble again.

790
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:08,143
See if the motherfucker
gets us all killed. Son of a bitch!

791
00:57:14,073 --> 00:57:14,983
Who did that to you?

792
00:57:15,673 --> 00:57:16,628
Nobody.

793
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:18,261
Was it Utrilla?

794
00:57:18,513 --> 00:57:19,628
Yes, it was him.

795
00:57:19,873 --> 00:57:20,908
Would you shut up?

796
00:57:21,073 --> 00:57:24,509
Don't worry, I'm not like him.
You can trust me.

797
00:57:25,153 --> 00:57:26,984
I don't think I said anything.

798
00:57:28,553 --> 00:57:30,271
I didn't even remember
it was him.

799
00:57:30,793 --> 00:57:32,829
When did I cut Utrilla's hair?

800
00:57:32,993 --> 00:57:34,108
Over 8 days ago.

801
00:57:34,313 --> 00:57:35,507
Almansa.

802
00:57:37,753 --> 00:57:38,947
It was Utrilla.

803
00:57:39,393 --> 00:57:41,953
The barber who cuts their hair
also does guards.

804
00:57:42,513 --> 00:57:46,222
He mentioned the transfer of the ETA
members and Malamadre heard about it.

805
00:57:46,873 --> 00:57:48,352
Not bad.

806
00:57:48,513 --> 00:57:51,789
Saving himself 10 euros on a haircut
has killed 3 people.

807
00:57:51,953 --> 00:57:52,988
3?

808
00:57:53,153 --> 00:57:56,668
2 more deaths in Nanclares de la Oca,
a guard and an ETA prisoner.

809
00:57:57,113 --> 00:57:58,182
Emilio Dominguez Arriola

810
00:57:58,353 --> 00:58:01,311
is the name of the guard
whose death has been confirmed

811
00:58:01,473 --> 00:58:03,350
in the riots at
Nanclares de la Oca.

812
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:07,984
With 15 years of service, he was
transferred here 3 months ago.

813
00:58:08,153 --> 00:58:11,748
As of this moment, ETA- related
prisoners have been isolated

814
00:58:11,913 --> 00:58:14,632
in all prisons
as a security precaution.

815
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:36,744
You can't stay here!

816
00:58:37,753 --> 00:58:39,232
You must leave the premises!

817
00:58:42,313 --> 00:58:44,622
Walk in an orderly fashion
to the exit.

818
00:58:45,553 --> 00:58:48,192
Hey, an ambulance is leaving!

819
00:59:19,033 --> 00:59:21,342
Have Lorenzo and Matias meet me
in the stockroom.

820
00:59:21,713 --> 00:59:23,032
On the double!

821
00:59:24,473 --> 00:59:26,270
Step away from the ambulance!

822
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,383
Step away from the ambulance!

823
00:59:42,313 --> 00:59:43,462
Fuck!

824
00:59:44,953 --> 00:59:47,183
What the hell are you doing
out there?

825
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:48,782
I don't know what you mean.

826
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:51,069
People are getting fucking
brutalized out there!

827
00:59:51,673 --> 00:59:54,745
The riot police probably
had no choice. Don't worry.

828
00:59:54,913 --> 00:59:56,631
Nothing will happen,
you have my word.

829
00:59:59,273 --> 01:00:02,026
Your word isn't worth shit!

830
01:00:08,713 --> 01:00:10,704
You better watch out.

831
01:00:11,273 --> 01:00:14,822
Somebody asked me to find out
if you could be trusted.

832
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:18,502
And?

833
01:00:19,233 --> 01:00:20,666
You can't be.

834
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:22,904
There's plenty weird about you.

835
01:00:25,153 --> 01:00:28,384
Why are you telling me this?
Malamadre is over there.

836
01:00:29,473 --> 01:00:32,112
I always give a man
a chance to defend himself.

837
01:00:35,993 --> 01:00:37,870
Or to offer something
in exchange.

838
01:01:09,513 --> 01:01:10,502
Elena!

839
01:01:20,153 --> 01:01:22,713
Elena's out there!
Give me the walkie- talkie!

840
01:01:22,993 --> 01:01:26,224
Give it to me, Elena's out there!
Give it to me!

841
01:01:29,513 --> 01:01:30,628
Elena is out there!

842
01:01:30,793 --> 01:01:31,942
Get her out of there!

843
01:01:32,393 --> 01:01:33,293
What?

844
01:01:33,793 --> 01:01:35,511
What the fuck are you doing?

845
01:01:35,673 --> 01:01:37,948
Stop the riot police,
Juan's wife is out there.

846
01:01:38,113 --> 01:01:39,944
- What's she doing there?
- I don't give a damn.

847
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,149
He saw her on TV.
We have to cut the signal.

848
01:01:43,313 --> 01:01:44,462
Get back!

849
01:01:44,633 --> 01:01:45,622
Get back!

850
01:01:57,153 --> 01:01:58,347
What's happening?

851
01:01:58,513 --> 01:01:59,662
What's happening?

852
01:02:33,153 --> 01:02:36,225
Can you imagine if we could be
like this forever?

853
01:02:37,073 --> 01:02:38,222
I wouldn't mind.

854
01:02:39,033 --> 01:02:42,582
But the baby will have
to go to school someday.

855
01:02:43,553 --> 01:02:47,023
Do you realize you worry more
about the baby than I do?

856
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:48,992
You know what they say.

857
01:02:49,873 --> 01:02:51,431
Children change your life.

858
01:02:53,113 --> 01:02:55,308
Yeah, they say that.

859
01:02:56,393 --> 01:02:58,463
But I don't want
our life to change.

860
01:02:59,353 --> 01:03:02,868
Promise me it won't change, that
you'll love me and fuck me the same.

861
01:03:14,593 --> 01:03:17,426
Almansa, what the fuck happened
to the TV?

862
01:03:17,993 --> 01:03:20,985
A demonstrator threw a Molotov cocktail
and the antenna caught fire.

863
01:03:21,153 --> 01:03:23,109
We're trying to get
the signal back.

864
01:03:23,273 --> 01:03:26,504
You'd better fix it. And I want
a list of the people injured.

865
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,869
All right, but I'll need time.

866
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:31,631
You have half an hour.

867
01:03:32,873 --> 01:03:35,785
What about Calzones's wife?
You found her, right?

868
01:03:36,113 --> 01:03:37,512
Yeah, she's fine.

869
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:41,786
In any case, tell Calzones
we had her taken to the hospital

870
01:03:42,073 --> 01:03:44,303
to make sure everything's okay.

871
01:03:45,713 --> 01:03:46,987
Hold on, tell him yourself.

872
01:03:51,393 --> 01:03:52,508
I want to talk to Elena.

873
01:03:56,153 --> 01:03:57,427
I'll see what I can do.

874
01:03:57,793 --> 01:04:00,466
But I don't think the doctors
want to upset her right now.

875
01:04:00,833 --> 01:04:02,312
You said she was fine.

876
01:04:02,473 --> 01:04:04,065
Yes, she is.

877
01:04:04,233 --> 01:04:06,622
But apparently they took her in
as a precaution.

878
01:04:09,313 --> 01:04:10,541
I have to see her.

879
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:12,112
I think that's the best idea.

880
01:04:12,313 --> 01:04:16,192
I can have you taken to the
hospital, you'll be back in an hour.

881
01:04:18,473 --> 01:04:19,622
I have to go.

882
01:04:25,393 --> 01:04:27,065
No, I'm sorry, Calzones.

883
01:04:28,273 --> 01:04:29,547
Not now.

884
01:04:31,513 --> 01:04:33,822
You're not the only one
with people out there.

885
01:04:34,713 --> 01:04:38,183
And if you hurt anybody out there,
I'll go berserk.

886
01:04:38,353 --> 01:04:40,423
It's the only fucking thing
you people understand.

887
01:04:56,353 --> 01:04:57,422
Don't bother.

888
01:04:57,593 --> 01:04:59,231
They put up inhibitors.

889
01:04:59,393 --> 01:05:01,463
One on each side of the roof,
jamming the frequency.

890
01:05:01,753 --> 01:05:04,108
The fuckers are going
out of their way.

891
01:05:04,273 --> 01:05:07,504
They don't want us to find out.
Something big must have happened.

892
01:05:07,673 --> 01:05:11,666
Why don't you ask them?
Just take the walkie- talkie again.

893
01:05:18,313 --> 01:05:20,668
Have you thought about
our conversation?

894
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,391
I have nothing to offer you.

895
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:24,107
What did they promise you,
faggot?

896
01:05:24,873 --> 01:05:26,272
Second degree murder?

897
01:05:26,713 --> 01:05:27,987
What about me?

898
01:05:28,153 --> 01:05:30,587
What do I get for keeping quiet?

899
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:32,228
What?

900
01:05:32,673 --> 01:05:33,742
Nothing?

901
01:05:35,793 --> 01:05:38,182
I might as well
just talk to Malamadre.

902
01:05:38,993 --> 01:05:40,472
Too bad for you.

903
01:05:40,793 --> 01:05:42,192
Your credit has run out.

904
01:05:43,633 --> 01:05:44,668
Wait.

905
01:05:44,913 --> 01:05:46,949
Wait, maybe there is something.

906
01:05:47,273 --> 01:05:48,786
A piece of paper.

907
01:05:53,313 --> 01:05:54,213
"Weapon,

908
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:57,111
sink, cell 233."

909
01:05:58,313 --> 01:06:00,144
In your handwriting.
Sound familiar?

910
01:06:02,353 --> 01:06:04,503
I don't know.
Show it to me.

911
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:08,472
If you want,
we can show it to Malamadre,

912
01:06:08,753 --> 01:06:10,106
see what he thinks.

913
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:13,662
Let me out.

914
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:23,505
You and me are gonna
make a deal.

915
01:06:25,113 --> 01:06:27,024
Find out what really
happened out there,

916
01:06:27,153 --> 01:06:28,632
and I'll give you that paper.

917
01:06:29,473 --> 01:06:31,429
So you can wipe your ass with it.

918
01:06:37,313 --> 01:06:40,942
These graphic images recorded
earlier have caused an uproar.

919
01:06:41,353 --> 01:06:45,062
Was the police response
too severe?

920
01:06:45,233 --> 01:06:47,349
Elena Vazquez Guardiola,
from Santander,

921
01:06:47,513 --> 01:06:49,868
remains hospitalized in Zamora

922
01:06:50,033 --> 01:06:53,264
under supervision
due to her injuries.

923
01:06:55,633 --> 01:06:57,828
How was I supposed to know
she was out there?

924
01:06:58,073 --> 01:07:00,633
You're the one who shouldn't
have been out there.

925
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:04,832
You're suspended from service.

926
01:07:05,913 --> 01:07:07,426
And you can pack your bags.

927
01:07:07,593 --> 01:07:09,265
When this gets out,

928
01:07:09,953 --> 01:07:12,023
you'll never set foot
in a prison again.

929
01:07:18,233 --> 01:07:22,272
If you play your cards right,
you're out in 7 years.

930
01:07:23,633 --> 01:07:25,271
I'll take the wrap for this.

931
01:07:26,913 --> 01:07:28,790
Just say you were
scared shitless,

932
01:07:31,153 --> 01:07:32,632
that you went along.

933
01:07:34,273 --> 01:07:36,104
That's what half these guys
will say.

934
01:07:39,793 --> 01:07:42,148
At age 7,
a kid wouldn't even realize.

935
01:07:43,633 --> 01:07:45,032
If I were you,

936
01:07:45,193 --> 01:07:46,706
I'd tell Elena
never to bring him here.

937
01:07:51,073 --> 01:07:54,110
The less to remind you
of the outside, the better.

938
01:08:00,553 --> 01:08:02,066
I have a kid somewhere.

939
01:08:02,553 --> 01:08:04,066
His mother was from Murcia.

940
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:06,186
Really feisty broad.

941
01:08:07,033 --> 01:08:09,228
She had no idea
I was an escaped fugitive.

942
01:08:10,433 --> 01:08:11,707
Does he look like you?

943
01:08:12,433 --> 01:08:14,583
I don't know.
I hope not.

944
01:08:15,753 --> 01:08:16,981
He must be 8 by now.

945
01:08:18,353 --> 01:08:19,832
But I've never seen him.

946
01:08:20,193 --> 01:08:21,387
"Out of sight..."

947
01:08:25,633 --> 01:08:26,952
The list.

948
01:08:29,073 --> 01:08:30,142
Only 4?

949
01:08:30,313 --> 01:08:32,588
They were clubbing people
left and right!

950
01:08:34,673 --> 01:08:36,026
Fucking bastards.

951
01:08:36,233 --> 01:08:38,110
Almansa really fucked up this time.

952
01:08:55,993 --> 01:08:57,187
What are you doing?

953
01:08:57,353 --> 01:08:59,344
If you kill him, they'll come in.
That's all they care about.

954
01:09:00,793 --> 01:09:02,226
They'll shoot their way in!

955
01:09:02,393 --> 01:09:03,508
It'll be a massacre!

956
01:09:03,633 --> 01:09:07,672
Tell him to leave.
If he comes in here I'll kill him!

957
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:10,472
- Calm down, Tachuela.
- Calm down my ass!

958
01:09:10,633 --> 01:09:13,227
You want to be remembered as the
madman who led them to slaughter?

959
01:09:13,393 --> 01:09:17,591
I don't give a shit! I told him
he'd pay if he fucked with us.

960
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:18,902
That's how it is.

961
01:09:20,753 --> 01:09:21,663
Hold him.

962
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:23,312
Cut off his ear!

963
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:27,872
That'll show them we mean business.
They won't risk coming in over an ear.

964
01:09:33,553 --> 01:09:34,747
Wait.

965
01:09:35,073 --> 01:09:37,587
- What for?
- I'm thinking, damn it!

966
01:09:43,273 --> 01:09:46,026
Fuck this shit!
Come here. Come here!

967
01:09:49,273 --> 01:09:51,992
You're gonna cut off his ear.

968
01:09:52,233 --> 01:09:53,222
Here.

969
01:09:53,513 --> 01:09:54,832
Cut off his ear.

970
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:58,748
Cut off his ear.
Cut off his ear! Cut it off!

971
01:10:00,473 --> 01:10:01,383
Cut off his ear.

972
01:10:25,313 --> 01:10:26,826
It's the list of people injured.

973
01:10:50,193 --> 01:10:51,706
Malamadre wants to see you.

974
01:10:51,953 --> 01:10:52,942
What for?

975
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,185
Malamadre.

976
01:11:21,473 --> 01:11:23,191
What faces...

977
01:11:23,553 --> 01:11:25,225
What, did somebody die?

978
01:11:31,033 --> 01:11:33,593
Apache found out about
the riot outside.

979
01:11:34,153 --> 01:11:35,711
At least 20 people were injured

980
01:11:35,953 --> 01:11:37,591
and 7 are hospitalized.

981
01:11:38,033 --> 01:11:39,386
Some of them serious.

982
01:11:43,393 --> 01:11:44,906
Among them, Elena.

983
01:11:48,073 --> 01:11:49,301
Show him.

984
01:11:53,233 --> 01:11:54,461
She shows up here.

985
01:11:55,193 --> 01:11:57,502
It's poor quality,
copied from the news.

986
01:12:00,193 --> 01:12:02,627
They said her name is
Elena Vazquez Guardiola.

987
01:12:02,993 --> 01:12:04,221
That's Elena, right?

988
01:12:06,713 --> 01:12:09,022
That's a guard, Utrilla.

989
01:12:09,193 --> 01:12:10,945
They call him the Old Bitch.

990
01:12:11,113 --> 01:12:12,831
The Old Bitch!

991
01:12:14,433 --> 01:12:16,663
He always liked hitting people.

992
01:12:47,393 --> 01:12:48,792
I want him to see him.

993
01:12:55,233 --> 01:12:56,427
Utrilla!

994
01:12:59,033 --> 01:13:01,069
Call from upstairs.
They want to see you.

995
01:13:04,473 --> 01:13:07,431
All I've done is string them along.
They don't trust me anymore.

996
01:13:08,233 --> 01:13:09,951
They can't send someone else
to negotiate?

997
01:13:10,113 --> 01:13:14,504
Malamadre said no. He asked for you.
He prefers somebody he knows.

998
01:13:15,073 --> 01:13:16,142
Armando should go.

999
01:13:18,073 --> 01:13:19,791
He's the new chief, right?

1000
01:13:20,273 --> 01:13:21,911
They should see
nothing has changed.

1001
01:13:22,553 --> 01:13:25,351
If you don't want to do it,
you don't have to.

1002
01:13:25,553 --> 01:13:27,748
Officially you've been suspended.

1003
01:13:27,953 --> 01:13:29,102
We'll talk about that later.

1004
01:13:41,273 --> 01:13:42,786
Happy with yourself, asshole?

1005
01:13:44,033 --> 01:13:44,988
Nice mess you've made.

1006
01:13:45,153 --> 01:13:46,984
Like my friend says,
"I do my best."

1007
01:13:49,353 --> 01:13:51,105
Utrilla sure has balls!

1008
01:14:05,553 --> 01:14:07,350
Don't move, motherfucker.

1009
01:14:13,593 --> 01:14:14,662
Open your mouth

1010
01:14:14,793 --> 01:14:16,226
and I'll kill you.

1011
01:14:19,153 --> 01:14:22,031
Now you and me are gonna
walk down those stairs, got it?

1012
01:14:25,993 --> 01:14:27,711
Where is he going?
Stay there!

1013
01:14:29,953 --> 01:14:30,853
They're going downstairs.

1014
01:14:30,873 --> 01:14:31,862
Where?

1015
01:14:31,993 --> 01:14:33,790
Downstairs to the basement.

1016
01:14:33,953 --> 01:14:35,830
Check the block.
Turn the camera!

1017
01:14:35,993 --> 01:14:38,029
- Turn it.
- Quickly.

1018
01:14:38,193 --> 01:14:39,945
Turn it, turn it, hurry up.

1019
01:14:43,513 --> 01:14:44,468
They're gone.

1020
01:14:44,633 --> 01:14:48,069
Shit, it's empty. It's a trap.
It's a fucking trap!

1021
01:14:53,433 --> 01:14:55,230
We have to get Utrilla
out of there.

1022
01:14:55,393 --> 01:14:58,191
I'm calling the Ministry.
We need authorization.

1023
01:14:58,353 --> 01:15:00,469
No, no.
There's no time for that.

1024
01:15:00,633 --> 01:15:01,952
Say the word and I'll go in.

1025
01:15:04,073 --> 01:15:05,631
I'm sorry,
I can't make that decision.

1026
01:15:07,033 --> 01:15:08,102
Maintain your position.

1027
01:15:09,513 --> 01:15:12,107
- What was that?
- Maintain your position.

1028
01:15:25,873 --> 01:15:27,465
The Old Bitch.

1029
01:15:29,753 --> 01:15:32,347
His wife is the one
you beat up out there.

1030
01:15:33,713 --> 01:15:36,625
- I didn't see her coming.
- A pregnant woman?

1031
01:15:38,073 --> 01:15:40,223
I didn't have time to react.
It was an accident.

1032
01:15:40,433 --> 01:15:42,503
Leaving her there
was an accident?

1033
01:15:47,553 --> 01:15:49,942
You clubbed her
and left her there.

1034
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:52,742
See it?

1035
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:55,782
Now do you see it?

1036
01:15:56,593 --> 01:15:57,582
Piece of shit!

1037
01:16:02,153 --> 01:16:03,871
Take it easy, damn it.

1038
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:06,504
- What happened to Elena?
- I don't know.

1039
01:16:07,033 --> 01:16:08,102
You don't know?

1040
01:16:09,313 --> 01:16:11,144
They took her to the hospital,
that's all I know.

1041
01:16:11,473 --> 01:16:14,192
You didn't even ask about her?
Bullshit! Look at me.

1042
01:16:14,353 --> 01:16:16,071
Look at me! Look at me.

1043
01:16:16,233 --> 01:16:18,064
Tell me the truth
or you're dead.

1044
01:16:18,673 --> 01:16:21,426
If she'd been badly hurt,
I would be suspended at home.

1045
01:16:21,593 --> 01:16:24,187
I want to talk to her.
I need her to tell me she's okay.

1046
01:16:28,953 --> 01:16:30,181
Here.

1047
01:16:30,553 --> 01:16:32,589
Tell him if Elena
doesn't pick up the phone,

1048
01:16:32,753 --> 01:16:33,902
we'll kill him.

1049
01:16:34,353 --> 01:16:35,991
That'll get their attention.

1050
01:16:38,073 --> 01:16:39,426
I want to talk to Elena!

1051
01:16:42,593 --> 01:16:46,029
Juan, this is Armando.
Do you remember me?

1052
01:16:46,713 --> 01:16:47,987
Yeah, I remember you.

1053
01:16:49,073 --> 01:16:50,552
Listen to me, Juan.

1054
01:16:51,233 --> 01:16:53,189
Elena can't talk to you
right now.

1055
01:16:53,353 --> 01:16:54,752
She's been sedated.

1056
01:16:56,833 --> 01:17:00,064
You're lying to me, damn it.
You're lying to me too!

1057
01:17:00,273 --> 01:17:02,787
Calm down, let me explain...

1058
01:17:03,153 --> 01:17:05,223
She can't be sedated,
she's pregnant!

1059
01:17:13,233 --> 01:17:15,542
Unless she lost the baby.
Is that it?

1060
01:17:19,273 --> 01:17:20,592
Did she lose the baby?

1061
01:17:21,113 --> 01:17:22,751
If she lost it,
tell me already.

1062
01:17:23,433 --> 01:17:24,707
That's it, right?

1063
01:17:25,633 --> 01:17:28,864
You're afraid to tell me. That's
why you've been lying all along!

1064
01:17:29,033 --> 01:17:30,148
Look, Juan.

1065
01:17:32,233 --> 01:17:34,030
You'd better come out.

1066
01:17:35,673 --> 01:17:37,629
Tell Malamadre
to let you come see Elena.

1067
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:40,264
I already asked him
and he said no.

1068
01:17:42,593 --> 01:17:44,151
Yeah, but now it's different.

1069
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:47,908
Why?

1070
01:18:01,993 --> 01:18:03,551
She isn't dead, is she?

1071
01:18:05,673 --> 01:18:07,186
Elena isn't dead...

1072
01:18:28,033 --> 01:18:29,102
I'm sorry, Juan.

1073
01:18:29,873 --> 01:18:31,670
I truly am.

1074
01:18:32,033 --> 01:18:33,785
We just got the news.

1075
01:18:36,433 --> 01:18:39,869
We wanted to wait until
all this was over with

1076
01:18:41,073 --> 01:18:43,143
to explain what happened to you.

1077
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:50,391
Get the fuck off me!

1078
01:19:51,433 --> 01:19:52,912
He's a guard!

1079
01:19:53,193 --> 01:19:55,149
Calzones is a guard!

1080
01:19:57,193 --> 01:20:00,629
Get off him! Get off him!
Get off him!

1081
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:06,864
Calzones is a guard!

1082
01:20:07,793 --> 01:20:10,148
Look me in the eye, damn it!

1083
01:20:10,553 --> 01:20:11,952
He's not an inmate!

1084
01:20:12,633 --> 01:20:13,986
He tricked you!

1085
01:20:14,273 --> 01:20:16,423
He tricked you!
He lied to you all!

1086
01:20:16,713 --> 01:20:18,510
He's a guard, damn it!

1087
01:20:19,513 --> 01:20:20,912
Tell them, Calzones!

1088
01:20:21,553 --> 01:20:24,465
Tell them who you are! See if they
still feel sorry for you!

1089
01:20:24,633 --> 01:20:25,861
Tell them, damn it!

1090
01:20:26,713 --> 01:20:27,613
Tell them!

1091
01:20:28,593 --> 01:20:29,493
Tell them...

1092
01:20:47,633 --> 01:20:51,023
A smart girl like you,
so pretty, and me...

1093
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:54,422
You being so ugly and dumb...

1094
01:20:58,553 --> 01:21:00,430
First a slaughterhouse,
now a prison.

1095
01:21:00,753 --> 01:21:02,869
It's not like I'm an engineer.

1096
01:21:04,673 --> 01:21:06,391
You could have anybody.

1097
01:21:06,953 --> 01:21:08,989
Somebody who could
give you stuff.

1098
01:21:10,193 --> 01:21:11,785
I don't want stuff.

1099
01:21:12,313 --> 01:21:13,746
I want you.

1100
01:22:13,953 --> 01:22:16,467
MY FUCKING HEAD HURTS

1101
01:22:18,873 --> 01:22:21,341
SICK, SICK, SICK...

1102
01:22:37,753 --> 01:22:40,142
MORAO'S HEADACHE
KILLED HIM HERE

1103
01:22:49,353 --> 01:22:54,473
CAR BOMB IN MADRID
ETA RESPONDS TO RIOT IN ZAMORA

1104
01:22:59,473 --> 01:23:01,270
What about what Utrilla said?

1105
01:23:01,433 --> 01:23:04,505
- I don't give a fuck what he said.
- What if it's true?

1106
01:23:04,873 --> 01:23:07,262
- What about this?
- Leave it there for now.

1107
01:23:08,153 --> 01:23:10,462
- What did Apache say?
- He didn't find anything.

1108
01:23:12,113 --> 01:23:14,422
He had the guts
to kill that fucker.

1109
01:23:14,593 --> 01:23:16,868
He's up to his neck in shit
just like everybody else.

1110
01:23:38,553 --> 01:23:39,827
Hello.

1111
01:23:40,433 --> 01:23:41,832
Ernesto Dueas.

1112
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:47,386
I've been sent directly by the
President to find a solution.

1113
01:23:47,793 --> 01:23:49,226
A bit late, no?

1114
01:23:49,393 --> 01:23:50,348
Excuse me?

1115
01:23:50,553 --> 01:23:53,431
If they'd been on the ball
we might not still be here.

1116
01:23:54,073 --> 01:23:55,711
You're probably right.

1117
01:23:56,113 --> 01:23:58,229
This situation should have been
handled differently.

1118
01:24:18,073 --> 01:24:19,950
I have full authority
to make a deal.

1119
01:24:22,593 --> 01:24:25,391
We studied your requests
before coming

1120
01:24:26,993 --> 01:24:29,666
and we're in a position
to concede in most cases.

1121
01:24:29,793 --> 01:24:31,863
We'd have to discuss
certain details.

1122
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:47,192
It's Utrilla.

1123
01:24:48,033 --> 01:24:49,261
A prison guard.

1124
01:24:51,633 --> 01:24:53,544
I'm responsible for his death.

1125
01:24:55,233 --> 01:24:56,507
You're Juan.

1126
01:24:58,233 --> 01:25:01,623
My name is Juan Oliver
and this is only the beginning.

1127
01:25:02,713 --> 01:25:06,103
Meet our demands or
we'll kill all 3 hostages.

1128
01:25:07,753 --> 01:25:10,904
They'll be dead before the SWAT team
can get to them, just like him.

1129
01:25:16,273 --> 01:25:18,264
He says they'll meet our demands.

1130
01:25:18,433 --> 01:25:20,264
We just need to work out
a few details.

1131
01:25:20,633 --> 01:25:23,193
And what will happen after that?

1132
01:25:23,353 --> 01:25:24,832
Your conditions will improve.

1133
01:25:25,033 --> 01:25:26,432
For how long?

1134
01:25:26,753 --> 01:25:28,027
I don't understand.

1135
01:25:28,713 --> 01:25:32,547
How long before you go back to doing
whatever you want with us?

1136
01:25:34,753 --> 01:25:35,947
All they want

1137
01:25:36,473 --> 01:25:38,111
is to stop this and lock us up

1138
01:25:38,273 --> 01:25:39,752
before anyone notices.

1139
01:25:41,753 --> 01:25:45,109
We're trash,
and what you do with trash

1140
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:47,582
is take it out
so it doesn't stink.

1141
01:25:48,793 --> 01:25:52,388
He might not be the right person
to be negotiating...

1142
01:25:52,513 --> 01:25:53,787
Why?

1143
01:25:55,593 --> 01:25:57,311
Because they killed Elena?

1144
01:26:00,993 --> 01:26:04,588
I might as well hang myself in
my cell and get out of the way.

1145
01:26:05,153 --> 01:26:06,552
I wouldn't be the first.

1146
01:26:08,433 --> 01:26:11,345
Do you know how the guy in cell 211
before me died?

1147
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:14,067
No, I don't.

1148
01:26:16,553 --> 01:26:18,191
We can't trust him.

1149
01:26:18,553 --> 01:26:20,783
They can't be trusted!

1150
01:26:24,393 --> 01:26:25,792
There's only one way.

1151
01:26:26,513 --> 01:26:30,142
They have to commit in public.
So they can't break their word.

1152
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:34,791
Make them say on TV
they'll end the DSS program.

1153
01:26:43,153 --> 01:26:45,621
To hell with solitary confinement!

1154
01:26:53,233 --> 01:26:54,552
Abolish DSS

1155
01:26:55,273 --> 01:26:59,869
and publicly acknowledge
all the people who have died here.

1156
01:27:01,273 --> 01:27:02,547
You have one hour.

1157
01:27:04,273 --> 01:27:07,948
We want to see the minister
on TV in one hour

1158
01:27:09,193 --> 01:27:11,502
saying this shit is over,
you got that?

1159
01:27:14,073 --> 01:27:15,791
Maybe I'd better give you

1160
01:27:16,033 --> 01:27:17,989
a little while to talk over

1161
01:27:18,153 --> 01:27:19,552
the situation.

1162
01:27:26,993 --> 01:27:28,551
There's nothing to discuss.

1163
01:27:31,353 --> 01:27:34,709
We're all behind him.
Shut down DSS

1164
01:27:34,993 --> 01:27:37,553
or you'll be hosing blood
off the walls!

1165
01:27:46,553 --> 01:27:50,262
You're a fucking dead man!
Nobody shows me up!

1166
01:27:50,833 --> 01:27:52,027
You know I'm right.

1167
01:27:52,193 --> 01:27:54,149
What did I tell you?
What?

1168
01:27:54,753 --> 01:27:57,631
That if you acted alone
I would gut you.

1169
01:27:58,833 --> 01:28:01,745
You also said this was
the chance of a lifetime.

1170
01:28:01,913 --> 01:28:04,905
Don't bullshit me!
You can't trick me!

1171
01:28:05,073 --> 01:28:07,951
You're just trying to get back at
them. Am I right?

1172
01:28:08,633 --> 01:28:10,589
Things are getting out of hand.

1173
01:28:10,753 --> 01:28:12,027
They're scared.

1174
01:28:12,513 --> 01:28:15,186
Why do you think they sent
a government official?

1175
01:28:17,433 --> 01:28:19,469
This is bigger than we imagined.

1176
01:28:20,633 --> 01:28:22,828
What will happen
if the hostages die?

1177
01:28:23,553 --> 01:28:27,102
I'll be remembered as the madman
who led everyone to slaughter.

1178
01:28:27,273 --> 01:28:28,626
Ring a bell?

1179
01:28:30,113 --> 01:28:31,228
Things have changed.

1180
01:28:31,353 --> 01:28:34,584
Yeah, now you don't care
if they kill us all.

1181
01:28:37,113 --> 01:28:39,388
You just said
in front of everyone

1182
01:28:39,553 --> 01:28:41,111
we're going all the way.

1183
01:28:42,433 --> 01:28:44,151
Are you gonna keep your word?

1184
01:28:46,553 --> 01:28:48,066
Are you?

1185
01:28:53,673 --> 01:28:56,062
Malamadre always keeps his word.

1186
01:29:04,473 --> 01:29:07,351
Take the hostages
up to cell 225.

1187
01:29:07,553 --> 01:29:09,862
Tell Releches not to let anyone in
unless I say so.

1188
01:29:10,073 --> 01:29:12,712
- What are you gonna do?
- Just do as I say, damn it!

1189
01:29:12,953 --> 01:29:14,625
- Malamadre.
- What?

1190
01:29:14,953 --> 01:29:16,022
We have to talk.

1191
01:29:16,193 --> 01:29:17,911
Almansa? I have nothing
to say to you.

1192
01:29:18,473 --> 01:29:20,304
We have something important
to tell you.

1193
01:29:20,473 --> 01:29:22,111
You know what we want to hear.

1194
01:29:22,713 --> 01:29:25,671
And you know it's madness.
We have to find a way out.

1195
01:29:28,473 --> 01:29:31,112
This better not be a trap
so you can shoot me.

1196
01:29:31,513 --> 01:29:35,142
If you thought it was a trap, you
wouldn't have come. Pick up the file.

1197
01:29:44,993 --> 01:29:46,949
It was a trick all along.

1198
01:29:47,113 --> 01:29:49,104
Juan isn't an inmate,
he's a guard.

1199
01:29:49,273 --> 01:29:53,152
He was supposed to start today,
but he got caught by the riot.

1200
01:29:55,793 --> 01:29:56,908
I don't believe it.

1201
01:29:58,873 --> 01:30:01,785
I don't believe it.
This is a trick, you bastard.

1202
01:30:02,113 --> 01:30:04,024
This is just paper and a photo.

1203
01:30:06,673 --> 01:30:08,152
What Utrilla said was true.

1204
01:30:08,433 --> 01:30:10,867
How the fuck do you know
what Utrilla said?

1205
01:30:11,473 --> 01:30:13,543
Juan isn't our only insider.

1206
01:30:14,033 --> 01:30:16,183
He was helping us
until his wife got hurt.

1207
01:30:16,633 --> 01:30:20,023
Now he's on his own. He doesn't give
a shit about anything and you know it.

1208
01:30:22,793 --> 01:30:25,227
Why the fuck are you
giving me this now?

1209
01:30:25,393 --> 01:30:26,621
What for?

1210
01:30:28,633 --> 01:30:29,952
So I'll kill him?

1211
01:30:31,793 --> 01:30:33,670
The government's offer stands.

1212
01:30:34,633 --> 01:30:38,421
You could be on the street
in a year, maybe less.

1213
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,831
He tricked us.

1214
01:30:46,993 --> 01:30:48,665
Malamadre, he tricked us.

1215
01:30:48,833 --> 01:30:51,791
All of us.
That bastard tricked us all.

1216
01:30:56,273 --> 01:30:59,822
And now those fuckers are in trouble
and they want us to kill him.

1217
01:31:01,073 --> 01:31:05,589
Not even the filthiest rat in here
would betray someone like that.

1218
01:31:05,753 --> 01:31:08,142
That guy is the fucking rat,
Malamadre.

1219
01:31:09,473 --> 01:31:12,545
He lied to us
and he has to pay for it.

1220
01:31:13,713 --> 01:31:16,591
The problem is the others
are behind him now.

1221
01:31:16,753 --> 01:31:19,984
We tell everyone he's a guard,
period!

1222
01:31:21,113 --> 01:31:24,025
What he asked for is crazy.
They'll never do it.

1223
01:31:24,513 --> 01:31:27,983
These people will never
admit defeat on TV.

1224
01:31:28,153 --> 01:31:30,667
When they give you something,
they do it quietly, in secret.

1225
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:32,471
Have they ever given you
anything?

1226
01:31:37,673 --> 01:31:40,062
Have they ever really
given us anything?

1227
01:31:41,753 --> 01:31:45,382
He's a son of a bitch, but he's
right. They're scared.

1228
01:31:46,713 --> 01:31:48,431
We have to go all the way.

1229
01:32:20,313 --> 01:32:22,269
Open up, open up!

1230
01:32:22,453 --> 01:32:23,253
What?

1231
01:32:23,353 --> 01:32:25,184
I already told you!
He's losing blood!

1232
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:27,989
You have to get him out of here!

1233
01:32:28,553 --> 01:32:31,590
- It's almost time.
- Open up, damn it!

1234
01:32:32,513 --> 01:32:33,741
Fuck!

1235
01:32:40,513 --> 01:32:41,662
It's time.

1236
01:32:42,313 --> 01:32:43,792
They have 10 minutes.

1237
01:32:44,553 --> 01:32:46,032
They might still call.

1238
01:32:46,513 --> 01:32:50,301
You're right.
A lot can happen in 10 minutes.

1239
01:33:13,313 --> 01:33:15,873
They're here.
Alpha and Bravo distract them,

1240
01:33:16,033 --> 01:33:18,342
Xavi drops down from the roof
and heads for cell 225.

1241
01:33:18,513 --> 01:33:20,185
They might have time
to kill them.

1242
01:33:20,353 --> 01:33:22,867
No, there'll be no resistance
when we reach the cell.

1243
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:29,945
I have to quit smoking.

1244
01:33:34,953 --> 01:33:37,467
Ever seen what it does
to your lungs?

1245
01:33:38,313 --> 01:33:40,110
All black and disgusting.

1246
01:33:42,993 --> 01:33:45,791
I don't think it will be
what kills you.

1247
01:33:50,233 --> 01:33:52,872
You're a real jerk, Calzones.
You know that, right?

1248
01:33:53,673 --> 01:33:55,345
I do my best.

1249
01:34:01,593 --> 01:34:03,345
Your best and more.

1250
01:34:05,233 --> 01:34:07,667
It takes a lot of balls
to do what you did.

1251
01:34:09,313 --> 01:34:12,385
Standing up there and telling
everyone you were an inmate.

1252
01:34:22,113 --> 01:34:24,627
Though things got screwed up
in the end with Elena.

1253
01:34:26,473 --> 01:34:29,067
Sometimes life fucks you up
and you don't even realize.

1254
01:34:44,873 --> 01:34:46,829
They asked me to kill you.

1255
01:34:51,113 --> 01:34:52,387
What did you tell them?

1256
01:34:55,233 --> 01:34:56,746
To go to fucking hell.

1257
01:35:07,513 --> 01:35:08,628
Now you and me

1258
01:35:09,833 --> 01:35:11,789
are going out that door

1259
01:35:11,953 --> 01:35:14,262
and we're gonna do
what we said we'd do.

1260
01:35:15,073 --> 01:35:16,904
And when the shit hits the fan,

1261
01:35:17,353 --> 01:35:20,151
you'd better hope they kill me quick
because if they don't,

1262
01:35:20,313 --> 01:35:22,349
I swear I'm gonna skin you alive.

1263
01:35:23,673 --> 01:35:26,631
Get that straight.
Nobody makes a fool of Malamadre.

1264
01:35:28,393 --> 01:35:30,953
Whatever happens,
you're not leaving here alive.

1265
01:35:37,313 --> 01:35:38,905
That's what you wanted, right?

1266
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:49,270
If those bastards don't tell me,
you will, right?

1267
01:35:53,353 --> 01:35:55,150
There's no way to ever be sure.

1268
01:35:57,033 --> 01:35:57,933
The TV's back on!

1269
01:35:58,073 --> 01:36:00,382
Hey, look!
The TV's back on!

1270
01:36:04,593 --> 01:36:08,427
... the Ministry of the Interior related
to the violence that began yesterday

1271
01:36:08,593 --> 01:36:11,949
at the prison in Zamora...

1272
01:36:13,193 --> 01:36:15,309
It's the end of DSS!

1273
01:36:54,513 --> 01:36:56,071
They're coming in!

1274
01:36:56,313 --> 01:36:57,213
They're coming in!

1275
01:37:04,073 --> 01:37:05,984
Kill the hostages!

1276
01:37:06,153 --> 01:37:07,188
Do it now!

1277
01:37:07,353 --> 01:37:08,253
There's no time!

1278
01:37:08,553 --> 01:37:09,463
Bullshit!

1279
01:37:09,633 --> 01:37:10,588
That way!

1280
01:37:11,713 --> 01:37:13,351
Throw them outside, damn it!

1281
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:15,591
Come on, damn it!

1282
01:37:54,513 --> 01:37:55,548
Calzones!

1283
01:38:25,273 --> 01:38:26,865
God damn it!

1284
01:38:27,193 --> 01:38:28,262
Calzones.

1285
01:38:28,433 --> 01:38:29,627
Calzones, look at me.

1286
01:38:30,873 --> 01:38:33,433
Look at me. You're okay.

1287
01:38:33,593 --> 01:38:35,470
You're okay. Look at me.
Look at me!

1288
01:38:35,953 --> 01:38:39,104
Look at me.
Stay here, with me.

1289
01:38:41,233 --> 01:38:42,746
- Damn it!
- They killed Malamadre!

1290
01:38:43,353 --> 01:38:45,105
They killed Malamadre and Calzones!

1291
01:38:46,073 --> 01:38:49,110
They killed Malamadre and Calzones!

1292
01:38:49,513 --> 01:38:51,231
They wish they could.

1293
01:38:51,673 --> 01:38:54,790
But not yet, right, Calzones?

1294
01:38:54,953 --> 01:38:56,227
We'll get those bastards.

1295
01:38:56,433 --> 01:38:58,389
We'll get those bastards good!

1296
01:39:21,193 --> 01:39:22,865
Motherfucker!

1297
01:40:43,873 --> 01:40:45,101
Yeah, that's him.

1298
01:40:46,713 --> 01:40:47,941
That's Juan Oliver.

1299
01:40:49,513 --> 01:40:52,266
The resolution of a crisis
of this sort

1300
01:40:52,393 --> 01:40:54,588
is never completely satisfying,

1301
01:40:55,233 --> 01:40:57,030
but I think, as a whole,

1302
01:40:57,153 --> 01:40:59,792
the final outcome
can be considered

1303
01:41:00,113 --> 01:41:01,387
a success.

1304
01:41:01,593 --> 01:41:02,662
This one's still alive!

1305
01:41:03,713 --> 01:41:05,704
Given the risks
and the limited

1306
01:41:05,873 --> 01:41:07,545
options at our disposal,

1307
01:41:08,313 --> 01:41:12,147
the appearance of an alternative to
a possible collaboration with Malamadre

1308
01:41:12,313 --> 01:41:13,712
made all the difference.

1309
01:41:14,593 --> 01:41:16,982
You could say
the wall had more cracks

1310
01:41:17,153 --> 01:41:19,109
than we at first imagined

1311
01:41:19,233 --> 01:41:22,305
and we were able
to exploit them in time.

1312
01:41:23,953 --> 01:41:25,466
On the negative side,

1313
01:41:25,873 --> 01:41:30,628
we mustn't forget that we were unable
to get Juan Oliver out of there alive.

1314
01:41:33,793 --> 01:41:35,226
Personally,

1315
01:41:35,433 --> 01:41:37,947
I must say I'll never
forgive myself for that.

1316
01:42:21,593 --> 01:42:24,824
MORAO'S HEADACHE
KILLED HIM HERE

1317
01:42:25,113 --> 01:42:28,344
CALZONES DIED HERE

1318
01:42:28,633 --> 01:42:30,271
Any more questions?
