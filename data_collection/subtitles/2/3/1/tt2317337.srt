1
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,987
You were saying that
this time it will be done.

2
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:46,797
This is a good business you have made.

3
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,562
Since last two years I am
taking treatment from you.

4
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:54,533
Bhatia sir I understand your feelings.

5
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,376
But didn't you only select
the donor after checking...

6
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,604
...the photo and other details.

7
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,847
I am just a doctor and not God.

8
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:06,078
We tried, but it
didn't work, what do I do?

9
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:10,418
Doctor it's been 8 years since
she's been keeping all fasts...

10
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,547
and hasn't left out any temple...

11
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,590
...mosque or any saint and now
your telling us "what to do".

12
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,125
I will get it printed in the Times
that you are cheating the people.

13
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:19,564
Bhatia sir you cool down...
have water. Don't take stress.

14
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,532
If not today then tomorrow,
she will definitely conceive.

15
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,000
What is Dr. Chaddha sitting here for?

16
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,401
Now look at this and understand.

17
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,167
This is the female organ...

18
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,442
See this is uterus here
somewhere here is the egg.

19
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:37,744
The sperm and the egg must meet.

20
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,411
Here the sperm travels,
travels and meets here...

21
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,920
...hits here and
then baby is conceived.

22
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,752
Some sperms penetrate,
some bounce back.

23
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,622
In your case this
meeting is not happening

24
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,127
Then make it meet.

25
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,996
If we don't have a child, my
brother will takeaway my business.

26
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,124
He is a big idiot.

27
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,501
Lets take god's name and try once more

28
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,697
Well fine, as it is it's been 2
years, might as well try once again.

29
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,902
But this time we need a good
quality sperm. - Definitely.

30
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,535
But this is the final try.

31
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,774
Come on... he said
he'll give us a good sperm

32
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:10,973
Come on...

33
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,744
Sir be prepared to put
these locks permanently.

34
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,181
The samples we have
are good for nothing.

35
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,153
Had even printed 3
ads in the newspaper...

36
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,593
...but not a single
reply worth considering.

37
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,595
Wretched sperm.

38
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,530
Chaman pick up the phone.

39
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,899
Dr. Chaddha's clinic.

40
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,839
I need to talk to Dr. Chaddha

41
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,012
He is in an emergency case. And
will call back, the moment he is free.

42
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,637
I wont spare that bas****

43
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:43,943
Tell that Dr. Chaddha of yours,
not to lie to me.

44
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,243
He has taken 30'/, advance from me...

45
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,919
Even after promising, he
hasn't given us a quality sperm.

46
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:53,482
You tell that f***er
I'll hunt him down...

47
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,126
Now, why you are staring at me.

48
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,596
As if I have used the sample.

49
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,991
Chaddha sir get me the
sample of a cricketer.

50
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,630
Not only will he play for the
country but also mint money.

51
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:11,071
And if we have a sweet girl
then she can become a model

52
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,112
Don't you worry about the money.

53
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,603
We will load you with cash.

54
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,011
We will take very good care sir.

55
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,879
I get it.

56
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,585
You want a Dhoni and
you want an Aishwarya.

57
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:22,245
Yes, sir.

58
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:26,184
Then there's no worry what the
child will be when he grows up.

59
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,795
First decide his career and
then give birth to the child.

60
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,890
I will call you. Ok sir.

61
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,090
Thank you.
- Thank you.

62
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,599
God bless.

63
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,989
Aunty take 300 rupees.

64
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,024
What's the matter Dolly aunty?

65
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,992
This shade of lipstick is looking
very nice... its suiting you I say.

66
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,563
When it comes to good looks...
all we can do is take care...

67
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,791
...though the truth is that
with age we will lose it...

68
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,096
...anyways your mom's henna is due.

69
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,169
I'll let her know.
- Just clean it quickly.

70
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,898
By the way did Vicky find a
job or is he still as useless?

71
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,673
He will find one, you needn't worry.
- Okay.

72
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,267
And listen didn't your
engagement break sometime back?

73
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,903
Aren't your folks
looking for another guy?

74
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,309
I will tell you later on. Okay...

75
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,843
...Ioud mouth.

76
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,279
Oh god its already ten
and Vicky is still sleeping

77
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,355
My knees pain...

78
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:35,227
I feel like a maid in my own house...
take care of parlor... grand mom.

79
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,592
Oh Vicky

80
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,627
Vicky why don't you wake up.

81
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,761
How long are you going to sleep now?

82
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,802
Wonder why She doesn't let him sleep

83
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,638
A theft has taken place.

84
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,135
Where has the T. V gone.

85
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,231
Vicky
- What happened?

86
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,810
Vicky they have taken the our T. V...

87
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,110
All the clothes also taken.

88
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,908
Were you sleeping like
Kumbhkaran (sleeping giant)...

89
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,108
...or did you eat an
entire pack of sleeping pills?

90
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,152
Every morning you get possessed
by some ghost or what? Move now...

91
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,950
grand mom we have been destroyed.
Bas**** have taken away everything

92
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,320
Why are you abusing? There
is nothing that you can do

93
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,088
Shut up and what you are
seeing from there like monkey.

94
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,322
Let me see atleast,
what are you doing?

95
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,626
We have been ruined grand mom.

96
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,791
...good that they stole
the TV coz if you had...

97
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:15,925
...to sell it to a trash picker...

98
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,127
...you wouldn't have got
more than one thousand.

99
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,101
Your all the old sarees
could've been used for this only

100
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,139
What are you smelling like a dog?

101
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,140
Looks like it was the black
underwear gang... just smell and see.

102
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:27,937
Go and lodge an FIR and find out
from the shop in Ambar Colony.

103
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,344
They might have sold the T.V. There.

104
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,940
Listen that Mr. Bhale is giving
1500 per month to the watchman...

105
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,416
...and whole night he
whistles outside his house.

106
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:34,653
Why don't you increase his fees?

107
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,984
Don't you dare talk
about the money to me.

108
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,420
God knows how many kilos of
detergent goes in washing yourjeans...

109
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,752
...and then who pays
for your shopping and...

110
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,831
...club expenses with your friends?

111
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,662
All I know is that if you
want to stay in this house...

112
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,794
...pay 5000 rupees every month...
and that's final.

113
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,668
Let me get the job once then
I will return all your money.

114
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:58,938
For God sake now don't
start the story of doing a job.

115
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,910
See the entire history so far...

116
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,311
no one has ever done job
in the family of Arora.

117
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,747
Here... take this

118
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,318
Umm... I will not keep quiet.

119
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,378
Why don't you take care of the
business along with your uncle.

120
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,685
You'll have to speak
English in the job.

121
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,727
And the expenses of the attire... I
am not going to give you a penny more

122
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,352
You are my mummy or my enemy.

123
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,727
Now where you are going with
the whisky. Won't you have tea.

124
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,026
Get me phenyl instead

125
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,965
I don't know anything. Now you
come to house after earning money

126
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,406
Vicky stop.

127
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,038
Now suffer because of the pampering...

128
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,169
Obviously there is no trend of
'good' morning in your father's house.

129
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,749
A robbery was to happen, it happened...

130
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,711
The whole life has gone by
but I've never purchased...

131
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,981
...anything for my own self.

132
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,316
My small parlor income can't
take care of your expensive desires.

133
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,225
Wants to buy a flat TV...

134
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,159
What to do your
destiny is only not good...

135
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,198
listen, get me one more
cup of tea. It's too cold.

136
00:08:55,968 --> 00:09:00,905
And as for TV, that I will
buy anyways... that too Sony.

137
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,032
What did you think that I am dog.

138
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,837
You'll sleep and I'll guard you.

139
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,844
I kept you for barking.

140
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,771
Lazy bum.

141
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,443
Listen. What is this.

142
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,087
Sirji you do your work.

143
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,919
What are you doing. This is my car.

144
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:20,922
Your car.

145
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,460
Then what. This is my car.

146
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,824
You keep you car. This is my dog.

147
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,329
You go with your dog.

148
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,399
This is my dog and I am tying.
What is your problem?

149
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,434
If it is yours then take
it some where else. - Why?

150
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,059
Munjal sir what happened.

151
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,104
Nareshji no one is
understanding the matter.

152
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,207
I was coming from the
market in the morning and...

153
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,776
...from market I went in the park.
I did exercise in the park.

154
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,936
What are you doing this.
You are just confusing us.

155
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,775
Munjal sirjust clear the matter.

156
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,315
You are not understanding.

157
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,114
I am telling that I went in the
market and did exercise in the park.

158
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,881
When I came here
then seen that this boy

159
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,354
...was tying his dog
in front of my car.

160
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,257
Oh god why you are taking so much
time in explaining. - I'll tell you.

161
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,459
This is your house.

162
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,858
Ground floor is mine.

163
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,794
Ground floor is yours and car
is also yours. - This is my car.

164
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,092
Is it your dog.

165
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,323
This is not my dog.

166
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,095
You understand this.
- The same thing I am telling.

167
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,160
This is not my dog.
You understand this.

168
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,464
This is a Labradog.

169
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,403
See carefully it is Doberman.

170
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:11,275
My experience says it is labradog.

171
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,402
What is this nuisance in the morning.

172
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,140
Now get lost from here.

173
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,943
You listen to me.

174
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,142
What are you doing?

175
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,014

176
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,588
Listen... I was...

Sold the dog. Bye God

180
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,261
Are you happy now? Come on, let's go.

00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,597

185
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,941
You won't be able to do it...

186
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,074
You just give chance and see.

187
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,276
Hi Baldev.

188
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,451

00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,202
I stay in Noida... can do updown.

196
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,204
I can sing

197
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,569
I won't get money?

198
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,210
Latha.
- Yes sir.

199
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,869
Latha give me a crocin.

world's losers for me.

Henceforth filter and then send.

204
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,352
Yes sir.

205
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,948
From tomorrow onwards you
start coming on my shop at Rajori.

206
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,584
You will learn the work in 5
- 6 months and...

207
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,890
...hen start your own work in
South Delhi. - That's right.

208
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,431
Yes How long will you be
wandering aimlessly here and there.

209
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,659
What's the problem?

210
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,424
You are the biggest problem.

211
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,063
All you do is sell clothes and you
will make Vicky also do the same.

212
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,631
What grand mom you are
also always cursing him.

213
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:51,910
What is wrong in his work.
- Again you started.

214
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,069
You always taunt him about his work...

215
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:57,013
Uncle I won't sell your polka
dot clothes. I want to do a job.

216
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,674
There is respect in that.

217
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,111
And respect is what sets apart
business class from officer class.

218
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,016
I won't lift your shop
shutter up and down...

219
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,556
Vicky this is no way
to talk to elders.

220
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,558
Mummy I want respect.

221
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,390
Oh ya as if I have no respect...

222
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,225
We are irrespectable people...

223
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,198

running 4 shops in Delhi

224
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,292

233
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,544
Grand mom when you give
only then I'll deserve.

234
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,952
No first you deserve and then take.

235
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:38,955
You are strange...

236
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:39,956
You will make me sell clothes.

237
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,517

238
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,288

243
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:00,142
Vicky... c'mon... don't I always

247

Give these duplicate bills later...
First tell the matter.

253
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,464

00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:40,313

00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,118
Mother runs a parlour.

260
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,519

00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,196
Father is dead but it seems he
has left a lot of money behind.

263
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,563
Status on Face book is 'complicated'
but on Orkut it shows 'single'.

264
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,067
And the watchman was saying that...

265
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,694
...he probably has an affair
with Sweta, his neighbour...

266
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,796
His job application has been
rejected from 4-5 places...

267
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,473
...and is a beloved of his grandma...

268
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,272
Listen my mood is off so If there is
something interesting then tell me.

269
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,778
Now should I make it up or what.

00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,570

275
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,324
At what age?

276
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,126
78 years.

277
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,257
Did you cross check?

278
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,062
There is record in corporation.

279
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,227

280
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:35,068
Address is 6/124, Lajpat Nagar

281
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:43,844
Dolly today it's not effecting.
Have you added more water?

282
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:49,310
Uhh you are drinking slowly.

283
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,289
But even I am not high yet.

284
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,586
Umm. Dolly I'll tell you something...

285
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,627
I respect you a lot.

286
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,360
Grand mom let it be. By morning
you will forget all this respect...

287
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,460
...and be back to
cursing me and my destiny.

288
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:11,433
Don't feel bad as I speak
anything in the hangover.

289
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:17,846
But I didn't get a
single penny in your dowry...

290
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,415
...this hurts me till date...

291
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,215
...that's why I speak like that...

292
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,313
...grand mom this is wrong.

293
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,491
You know I have given my whole life...

294
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,790
...and my beauty
parlour income to you.

295
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:37,596
I never served my own mother
as much as I have served you.

296
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,168
And you speak like this...

297
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,799
I know it.

298
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,844
And only you can take my tantrums...

299
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:50,507
...that's why I respect you...

300
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,407
but only if you had got
something for me from...

301
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,885
...your home when you got married...

302
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,156
it would have been nice...

303
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:02,489
when Vicky wife will
get nothing for you...

304
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,256
then you'll know how much it hurts

305
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:09,593
Uhh grand mom I told
you several times...

306
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:13,536
...not to take the
Vicky's name while drinking...

307
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,334
...I loose the high.

308
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,605
I don't know what he
will do in his life.

309
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:25,875
He is a good boy and one day he
will make our ARORA family famous.

310
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,284
Prepare one more.

311
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,621

00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:41,865
Sir one round takes 15 minutes.

315
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,696

and not the superman.

316
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:28,239
Yes sir what is the matter.

317
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,975

318
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:32,916
I will dial the number 100

319
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,542
Please don't misunderstand me.

00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,621
I am law abiding citizen.

321
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,753

322
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,519

326
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,264
Just I asked this casually.

327
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,999
Now you tell me about your hobbies.

328
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,434
Hobbies... nothing.

329
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,706

understand that you are correct man.

330
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,804

336
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,055

married couple who don't have any issue.

Side by side I am running a bank also.

347
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:52,464
For that I need a
special donor. Sperm donor.

348
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,401
What happen.

349
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:57,793
What so funny?

350
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,765
Sir this is the thing for donation.

351
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,430
What so funny about it?

352
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,836
Stop.

353
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,941
Why are you laughing?

354
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,911
Thank you sir for
dropping me home in the cold.

355
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,951
What's so funny about it?

356
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,487
Think about it... I will pay you well.

357
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,488
Let it be thank you.

358
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,942
If he wasn't my neighbor, I
would have hit him with my sandal...

359
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:46,711
You beat him and see. I
will cut your water pipeline.

360
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,683
Then we'll see how
you wash your henna.

361
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,721
...Indian Idol wannabe...

362
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,383
No grand mom you don't be angry.
I was justjoking.

363
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,393
Here Vicky have this...

364
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,860
I said thank you Pepsi aunty.

365
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,989
Hello Dolly Beauty Parlour.

366
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,726

00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,734

368
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,394
Come quickly.
- Yes.

369
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,131
Yes hello Vicky here.

370
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:14,509
You... this is the limit...

371
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:18,980
No thank you sir. Now next
time don't try to call me again.

372
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,044
Wrong number.

373
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,851
Nowadays too wrong number
phones are coming for you.

374
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:24,980
Vicky listen.

375
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:25,987
Yes what?

376
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:29,788
This is parlour's money, go and
deposit it in the cooperative bank.

377
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,088
No mummy

378
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,527
No ya mom... your bank is dated...
it has no reputation...

379
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:33,757
not even an ATM...

380
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,423
Don't fuss around... we've had an
account in the bank since partition.

381
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,435
I am going... but to
open a new account.

382
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,061
Vicky please don't
create a new problem.

383
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,800
Sure. Sure.

384
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,472
Yeah, just give me
like one hour. Okay?

385
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,048
Excuse me.

386
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,618
Ma'am I want to open an account.

387
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,587
And here is the money.

388
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,719
Have you come for the
first time in the bank?

389
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,519
Yes.

390
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,191
Well, sir that's not how
the accounts are opened.

391
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:10,992
Fill up the form and take
a token from that counter.

392
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,695
You can come back as
your number comes.

393
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,170
But Ma'am there is
no one in the queue.

394
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,674
Sir these are bank rules. Please.

395
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,676
Weird rules I say.

396
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,837
Sir your money.

397
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,042
Thank you,

398
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,479
Thank you so much.

399
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,049
Ashima lunch

400
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,486
Come on, let's go.

401
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,053
Ma'am you are going half day.

402
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,256
I got the token also and we
will fill up the form also.

403
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:38,859
Its lunch hour sir.

404
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,021
I have to go.

405
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,692
Till then you sign on the bottom.

406
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,032
3 passport photos and
some one to introduce you.

407
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,197
Why others. I can introduce myself...

408
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,607
Myself Vicky Arora
and you are Ashima Roy.

409
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,702
Oh you are a Bengali?

410
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,576
Yes I am not Punjabi.

411
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,513
You bring some one else who
has an account in this bank...

412
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:01,881
...and can introduce you.

413
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,610
Okay.

414
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,755
Shall we?

415
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,853
Ashima, he is Varun's friend.
- What?

416
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:10,623
Sir.

417
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,696
Now what?

418
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:13,622
Fifth?

419
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:19,968
The clinic is suffering losses and
you are producing one after another...

420
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:23,200
I have already offered
you but you always say no.

421
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:27,244
Shut up. There is something called
the family back ground of sperm.

422
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:28,670
Duffer sperm!

423
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,309
Cancel all my appointments.

424
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,552
Madam how is it fault if
I have had a fifth child?

425
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,013
Here, you have...

426
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,748
I thought you'd be a decent
guy since you're a doctor.

427
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,850
By God you really have a dirty mind.

428
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,255
Very awkward. What is dirty in that?

429
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,030
You are asking youngsters to
do such type of cheap work...

430
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,863
Do you even know what
you are talking about?

431
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:55,171
I have good respect and
my patients worship me

432
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,763
It makes no difference to me.

433
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,269
Keep your respect at home...
doesn't matter to me...

434
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,036
I hate kids

435
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,009
But why?

436
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,842
Have you ever smelled them?
There is so much foul smell.

437
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,910
Of urine... of potty... and
when they vomit doing wuack...

438
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,287
I don't want to have kids...

439
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,652
Who is telling you to
give birth to a child?

440
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,190
When it is my sperm then
won't the child be mine?

441
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,589
Only your sperm will be used.

442
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,361
Talk softly... the
shop owner knows me...

443
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,961
Sorry, sorry.

444
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,758
Ya ya I've got it all packed...
now please keep the phone...

445
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,833
Now what I was saying was that...
only the sperm will be yours

446
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,970
...but the responsibility of
the children will not be yours...

447
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,736
Neither the susu nor the potty...

448
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,210
In any case it is going waste.

449
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,913
Become a donor, at least
some one will be benefited.

450
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,952
No how do you know
that it is going waste.

451
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,212
And as it is it gets wasted only...

452
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,051
Shall I store it in a
syntax tank overhead or what

453
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,219
Don't store in the
tank but store with me.

454
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:53,059
I will give you money also for that.

455
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,198
Sir why are you
getting me trapped into...

456
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,631
I am trapping you?

457
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,994
The real trapping is what the
people in cities face these days.

458
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,302
This infertility is the
cancer of modern life.

459
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,103
I don't want to listen.

460
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:11,974
My dear this is the problem of
insecure and highly ambitious people.

461
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,675
See the routine life.

462
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:19,354
Sitting late in the office then
fighting the traffic return home...

463
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,154
...taking drink and
again working on the laptop.

464
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,320
And finally telling your wife
that darling I am too tired.

465
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,988
There married life becomes hell...

466
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,857
One's left unable to
do the real work...

467
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,764
On the other hand are our villagers...

468
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,427
their touch is enough
to make a woman conceive

469
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,667
Do you know the root cause
of this problem... ask me what

470
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,972
what...
- Stress

471
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,176
What?

472
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:41,302
Stress.
- Stress.

473
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:45,042
The sperm count becomes low
as the stress goes higher.

474
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:48,118
You and the village...
same to same... copy... ditto

475
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,383
lucky... happy... and
stress free... highly fertile...

476
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,856
...help me please

477
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,191
you've come back to your purpose...

478
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:59,752
I don't want to do
this social service.

479
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,263
Okay, I agree to you.

480
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,362
But what is the guarantee
that there will be child.

481
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,028
No there is no guarantee...

482
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,798
No guarantee.

483
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,167
But this will be known...

484
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:15,269
...whether you are capable to
give birth to a child or not.

485
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,709
Stop the car.
- Yes.

486
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,047
I said stop the car.
- One minute what happened?

487
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,479
Stop the car.

488
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,721
What happened?

489
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,186
Hello!

490
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:34,398
How could you say it...
that I am not fit for that...

491
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,425
I cannot give birth to a child?

492
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,002
Don't misunderstand me.

493
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,934
Misunderstanding... my foot...

494
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:41,463
Now dare you call me ever again...

495
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:42,740
Listen to me.

496
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,502
Who are you to talk
such crap about me?

497
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,301
Don't misunderstand me.

498
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,077
Sorry dear

499
00:25:56,788 --> 00:26:00,383
I'm telling you... I can
give birth to as many kids...

500
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:06,190
That is exactly why I came to you.

501
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,337
Heights of being a pile on ya...

502
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,048
Now what are you doing here?

503
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:28,313
Drinking affects the
strength of the sperm...

504
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:29,783
Uhhhhh...

505
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,080
I haven't said yes to you as yet...

506
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,885
But you haven't said no either...

507
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:35,950
Understand my problem.

508
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,402
Will you have cold coffee?

509
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,829
Can I drop you somewhere?

510
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:54,469
See Vicky I am not pressurizing you.
But please understand my situation...

511
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,015
Can we talk in the evening. Ok.

512
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,811
Shall I wait.

513
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,818
What time, what time in the evening?

514
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,090
There is one link.

515
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:11,325
My cousin's brother in
law works with the RBI.

516
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,827
Sorry sir, not possible.

517
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,601
I think I'll now have to
find a source in the ministry

518
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,269
Not even then sir

519
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,174
There must be some way out.

520
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,039
I don't know anyone who
has an account with your bank

521
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,045
...does that mean I
can't get my account opened?

522
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,477
Sir I have already told you
I do not have the authority.

523
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,315
You could speak to the Branch Manager.

524
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,410
I spoke to him

525
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,925
By the way Ashima, your
account is with this bank right?

526
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,295
Obviously

527
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,128
Lets, you and me become friends...

528
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,367
...and you give me a NOC...
my works done...

529
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,469
Sir I don't know you.

530
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,403
Care for some coffee

531
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,575
I'll get some connection... see you...

532
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,088
Dr. Chaddha I really
gave it a serious thought

533
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:18,660
I am unemployed, sort
of good for nothing...

534
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,421
that doesn't mean I'd do
such kind of silly work...

535
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,901
So my final decision is a NO!

536
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,896
Do you believe in God.

537
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,937
Almost

538
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,042
Then, for god's sake say yes

539
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:37,548
See if I don't get a donor like you,
my clinic will get ruined...

540
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,241
the competition is very tough...

541
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,116
...everything will get ruined...

542
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,948
Listen don't do this emotional talk.

543
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:46,154
Please go ahead and
catch some other party.

544
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,156
Thank you.

545
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,425
What are you saying?

546
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,291
Here... things are getting
ruined and you're saying...

547
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,522
...I should speak to someone else...

548
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,496
It won't be that
easy to get someone else

549
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,025
So what do I care... sit on the seat...

550
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,131
Is there only one guy
in the whole of Delhi.

551
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,937
...neither does he belong
to the Tatas or Birlas...

552
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:07,210
You're just wasting your time
behind him... for no reason...

553
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,409
There is...

554
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:13,039
There is... something in the boy

555
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:17,612
This one is of our south trip.
That time Vicky was 8 years old.

556
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,519
And this one... is when I was young

557
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,558
You don't look old now either.

558
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,119
Thank you.

559
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,054
Well...
- By the way I'm not that old...

560
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,992
...but when faced with increasing
responsibilities at a young age...

561
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,535
...the stress does come out on
the body and face. - Yes yes.

562
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,630
And this one is my husband's.

563
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,333
He died after this trip.
This is his last photo.

564
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,471
Doesn't he look a lot like Obama.

565
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:42,102
Yes yes... same to same...
just 2 shades fairer...

566
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:45,979
Whenever that chap comes on TV,
I leave all my work and sit...

567
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,519
It feels as if he has
taken a rebirth in America.

568
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,086
Oh Vicky you've come.

569
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,988
You didn't tell me that you are
starting a business with Chaddha sir.

570
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,221
You got quite late.

571
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:03,358
You were quite a naughty boy... have
come to know of your entire history...

572
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,526
But I didn't reveal
that thing, promise...

573
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:10,472
Oh no man, by god, mom's swear,
you have crossed the limit

574
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,644
Relax, mummy will hear it

575
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,077
Please, don't touch me.

576
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:19,247
Do you know what a
big pile on you are?

577
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,146
See if you don't want
to do it, then don't.

578
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,092
But don't call me a pile on.

579
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,553
It hurts.

580
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:31,627
You only tell me...

581
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:33,690
Sir I am a common man.

582
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,697
I live in Lajpat
Nagar's refugee colony...

583
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,029
My mother is a widow.

584
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,304
If she, Pepsi aunty,
Sharma's, Bhalla's, Chopra's...

585
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,398
if they come to know that I do such...
meaning such kind of work...

586
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:45,770
...then I'll lose all my respect...

587
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:48,045
you'll get me thrown
out of the colony.

588
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:54,818
See what I am trying to say is
that I am a certified MBBS doctor...

589
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,515
...and this work is legal.

590
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,658
Not from today but since
the times of the Mahabharata.

591
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,817
I can stand at India
Gate and announce that...

592
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,529
...its an ancient science...

593
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:10,397
when women couldn't have children,
they used to call Rishis...

594
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:14,299
Rishis used to give their blessings...
'tatha asthu'...

595
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:19,606
...and there... done... it's a very
ancient science... what's wrong in it

596
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:23,075
And if you look at it from
a business point of view...

597
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,581
...then you can make money,
I can make money...

598
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:29,449
...my clinic will get saved...
rest is upto you...

599
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,158
Should I leave?

600
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,421
Good night.
- Good night.

601
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,834
Yes.

602
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:53,804
Yes, Dr. Chaddha had come in the
morning, he's very jocular by nature

603
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,881
Whiskey has come back... don't know
from where Dr. Chaddha got him from

604
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:58,206
Okay, mom.

605
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,119
The baby has to be matching with us.

606
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,318
We are very classy people...

607
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,895
...we want our baby to be
like us... refined... you know.

608
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,126
Absolutely aristocratic...

609
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:19,367
Not a problem. Just fill up
your requirements in the form.

610
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,135
Next week John
Abraham is coming to Delhi.

611
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,468
If he agrees, then
we'll make a deal with him.

612
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,872
Don'tjoke, Baldev.

613
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,772
Madam you are the one joking.

614
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,240
See it is my guarantee to
give you a healthy sperm...

615
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,318
...with a good hit rate.

616
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,150
But whether the baby will be well
behaved or naughty how I can tell?

617
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,850
You have a nice day.
- Thank you very much, Dr. Baldev.

618
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,153
Next

619
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:44,586
Sir!

620
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,163
Don't you think it
is a little bit funny?

621
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,629
Yeah, that's okay. Its alright.

622
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,665
Listen to me clearly.

623
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:57,897
Tell me.

624
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,608
I am doing this only for pocket money.

625
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,548
There has been no change of heart

626
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:06,615
Okay.

627
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,185
I still hate children.

628
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:09,481
Got it.

629
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:10,945
Got it.

630
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,353
Go there.

631
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,947
Latha.
- Yes sir...

632
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,385
Take his details.

633
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,391
Okay sir.

634
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,795
Name?

635
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:18,725
Vicky Arora.

636
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,797
Sex?

637
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:20,930
Male.

638
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,796
Age?
- 25.

639
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,299
Height?
- 5'10

640
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,767
Come.
- You're coming with me?

641
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,928
Yes, sir. Come sir

642
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:33,868
There is the wash basin, and
here is the tissue paper...

643
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,705
...and here is the container.

644
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,974
In this, you may
throw it and store it...

645
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:42,476
Okay sir.

646
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,578
Done sir.

647
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:15,911
What happened?

648
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,317
Wouldn't happen like this...

649
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,415
No problem.

650
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:22,493
This is called performance
pressure in medical terms.

651
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,823
Everyone goes through it...
even cricketers before a game...

652
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:25,827
Don't get tensed.

653
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,761
Come with me.

654
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,799
Come come... inside here...

655
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,890
Lata!

656
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,264
Yes sir.

657
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,861
Thank you.

658
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:36,404
Sit... sit

659
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:39,271
Don't take stress. We have
a solution for everything.

660
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:40,901
Here, take this this Oh Boi...

661
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,539
Double X boys... Excite boys...

662
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:50,816
Triple X... and this
is wild ones... right...

663
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,012
All the best.

664
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,724
Play the DVD and put on
the headphones... all the best

665
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:11,909
Done?

666
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,900
Done sir.

667
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,414
Congratulations. Your first payment.

668
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,609
Balance will be paid to you
after completing the procedure.

669
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:21,742
Balance payment.

670
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:25,049
What I mean is that for
the next five to six months...

671
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,847
...this sample will
be tested in the lab...

672
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,861
...and if there is a meeting with the
egg then we shall pay you the balance.

673
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,555
As it is we have a done deal right

674
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:34,796
You just enjoy!

675
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,857
The spark plug is jammed

676
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,902
My destiny is doomed

677
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,335
My destiny is doomed

678
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,336
Sharma's, Rowde's,
Bhalla's, all victims

679
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,468
Part of the guilty army

680
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,876
Part of the guilty army

681
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,874
No more prayers, no more medicines

682
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,782
I am changing my style

683
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,885
Let all men take a hike

684
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,854
I have found the potent Chaddha

685
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,390
Chasing...

686
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,416
Chasing...

687
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,119
Chaddha is on the pursuit

688
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:08,524
Chaddha is on the pursuit

689
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,533
Chaddha is on the pursuit

690
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,501
Chaddha is on the pursuit

691
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,595
Vicky you... now what...

692
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,432
You had told me that you will
meet me when I get myself a job.

693
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:18,802
So I came here first

694
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,069
Yeah?

695
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:21,871
Oh you are working now

696
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,145
Marketing?
- Yuck...

697
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,709
I am a sperm donor

698
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,017
Only sick people like you
can do this kind of work.

699
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,913
Next time don't show
me your face... Get lost.

700
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,088
He's modern's world's handyman

701
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,529
Going all around with his sticky hands

702
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,466
Ashima.

703
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:48,504
Hello

704
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:49,867
Ashima

705
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,506
Ashima
- Ashima

706
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,677
Ashima
- Ashima

707
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,110
Ashima
- Ashima

708
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:57,736
Heck!

709
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,741
Ashima
- Hello

710
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,146
...Is she your relative?

711
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,442
Brother I was helping you.

712
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,545
Keep your help with yourself,
and get out of here.

713
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:06,850
Seriously, the world just
does not appreciate decency...

714
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:09,419
And why should I go that way,
I'll go this way...

715
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,690
Get lost.

716
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,025
I am a sperm donor
- What?

717
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,121
Chaddha is on the pursuit

718
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,701
Chaddha is on the pursuit

719
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,531
Chaddha is on the pursuit

720
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,504
Chaddha is on the pursuit

721
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,073
Couldn't you knock before entering

722
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:29,907
Why you are feeling shy?

723
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,605
Mummy papa have gone for a wedding.

724
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,013
I.T.O.

725
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:37,144
So you've come parading yourself,
to celebrate your honeymoon...

726
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,452
F*** you!

727
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,658
Now even if you call me,
I won't come...

728
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,829
...you know that Sunny and Bunty,
they're always running after me...

729
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,962
...and that Pitampura guy,
he's even bought a car...

730
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,465
I've got everyone
hanging just for you...

731
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,560
Who are you showing attitude to...
I've never stopped you...

732
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,731
Fine, I'm just warning you...

733
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,639
...that there's a whole cue of
boys waiting for me out there...

734
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,538
so don't be in this illusion
that you're the only one...

735
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,775
Shut the door... I've
to change my shirt

736
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,544
Ya ya no one's watching you...

737
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,483
bloody loser!

738
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:10,847
She thinks she is too smart.

739
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,111
I am coming, mother!
- Just go.

740
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,214
Hey Vicky... listen up brother...

741
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,925
Just go off to sleep man...
always butting in from behind

742
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,493
Listen Dimpy, from the parlour,
was giving me the look...

743
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,962

744
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,032
You went to the parlour.
- Yes

745
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,964
Mum will take my case...
don't ever do that again.

746
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,730
Sorry, see you always
get the action bro...

747
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,099
...here I have a
genuine problem right...

748
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,969
Alright, listen, listen, Don't
introduce me, that's alright.

749
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,106
Get me from somewhere else then...

750
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,143
Who am I

751
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,212
Get me some action ya bro
- Here take mine...

752
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,549
You are forgetting your promise.

753
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,150
The love goddess
will never forgive you...

754
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,531
Oh Vicky!

755
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:56,700
Congratulations.

756
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,291
We met at the bank.
- Really

757
00:38:58,569 --> 00:38:59,797
Get my account opened

758
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,873
How are you?
- Very good.

759
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,811
Hey... what's up

760
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,669
Hi!

761
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,549
Looking sweet.
Different... kind of cute

762
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,108
Thank you.

763
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:20,087
So, you're single.

764
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,250
How would you know?

765
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:26,094
Otherwise your boyfriend would
be sniffing around like a dog...

766
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,857
...guarding you...
- Excuse me.

767
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:32,564
I am an independent working
girl and not like other girls

768
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:33,326
I know.

769
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:34,866
Therefore don't even try.

770
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,903
Why, working girls don't have affairs?

771
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:42,308
May be, but they definitely don't
need a boyfriend sniffing around them...

772
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,275
...atleast I don't

773
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:46,748
Madam see... that depends...

774
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,910
...if you trap a simple, decent dog...

775
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,250
I mean boyfriend like me...
then he is bound to sniff around...

776
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:58,050
I am trapping you... don't forget
you came here to speak to me...

777
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,061
don't forget...

778
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:02,155
Look... standing here alone...
, all dressed up...

779
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,691
...these are the
beginnings of setting the trap...

780
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,771
I didn't know that I'd meet you here...

781
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,601
And if you would have known, you
wouldn't have come dressed up?

782
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:15,937
I wouldn't have come!

783
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:18,846
Hi.

784
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,624
You are back!!

785
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,622
No, am still stuck in traffic.
Didn't sleep yet...

786
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:37,300
Your dad would snore all night,
let out gas repeatedly...

787
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,770
I would fight that you
are not letting me sleep...

788
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:44,398
I would then come to
your room and sleep...

789
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:48,402
...and no sooner would I catch a
wink than he'd come & call me...

790
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:52,338
...would hold my hand all night long...

791
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:56,913
...how do I suppose I'd
feel sleepy now all alone?

792
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:58,649
Shall I prepare a drink.

793
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,665
No, I'll go in just five
minutes and sleep down

794
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:27,716
By the way hundred percent we
share some higher connection between...

795
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:29,719
we keep bumping into each other...

796
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,879
first at the market,
then on the road...

797
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:36,983
...then at the sangeet...
quite unbelievable.

798
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:43,165
Remove the life out of the computer...
what're you so busy with...

799
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,894
...that you can't even
spare a minute to respond...

800
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:48,365
...there's this dude sitting
in front of you talking crap...

801
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,037
...atleast respond...

802
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,736
Sir this is not my drawing room.

803
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,838
That I should
entertain you... it's a bank...

804
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:02,218
Give me your address,
drawing room, bedroom...

805
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,380
we could chat anywhere. Even
I am quite uncomfortable here

806
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:14,453
Sorry.

807
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:20,397
Was telling you... to be seated
quietly... now you've broken it...

808
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,499
...give you one tight one...

809
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,071
Sir is that your son...

810
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:26,174
...yes he is my son.

811
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,869
No just think and be
sure that he is your son.

812
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:30,213
Yes he is my son.

813
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,305
Does anyone get his son to
the bank for an outing...

814
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,450
...its the worlds most boring place...

815
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,213
...listen kid you carry on playing

816
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,022
He's come here so many times.

817
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,790
I know he is an over the
top guy, but he's cute.

818
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,922
Come on your single enjoy it.

819
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:50,924
Don't be a bore

820
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,263
Enjoy

821
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,026
What bore...

822
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:57,805
...why do you people feel that I
don't want to be in a relationship.

823
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,376
No listen. I have to be sure first.

824
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:04,447
Yes but atleast meet
him once & as it is...

825
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,277
...who is asking you
to have sex with him.

826
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:09,011
Look at these marriage photos... both
of you are looking so cute together.

827
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,484
See this one.

828
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:57,060
Dr. Trehan any problem.

829
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:00,400
Ok let me call you back.

830
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,435
Whose sample is this?

831
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:04,373
Is everything ok.

832
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,272
Ok. More than ok.

833
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,001
I say unbelievable.

834
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:12,014
His sperm count is 100 million
and motility rate is very strong.

835
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:13,447
Outstanding.

836
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,847
Who is this?

837
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,609
Well, he's a foreigner...

838
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,489
So finally you found your Alexander

839
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,922
Dr. Trehan why are you joking with me.

840
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,629
Hello Chaman give an
appointment to Bhatia.

841
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,458
Vicky!
- Yes

842
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:35,571
Some Chaman had come
by in the morning...

843
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,368
...and gave this sweet box...

844
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,535
...was saying there's some good news.

845
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,101
When did he come.

846
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,202
He had come early in the morning

847
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,510
So how does it feel.

848
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,052
You've conceived for the
first time... that too twins...

849
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:53,014
I am darn sacred...

850
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,885
I am darn sacred...

851
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:59,018
Meaning why the hell did
you send the laddoos home...

852
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,130
...henceforth am not telling
anyone that I am a sperm donor...

853
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:05,630
...the women are slapping me
while your making me eat laddoos

854
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:09,161
You know... women they're
just wired differently...

855
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:13,004
...god hasn't made such a
woman who can understand a man...

856
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:16,375
...but you don't feel disappointed...
it'll affect...

857
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:19,974
...and with such women... neither
waste your time nor your sperm...

858
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:22,075
...seriously your sperm
count is outstanding...

859
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,244
first time in my career...

860
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,651
lets give it another shot...

861
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:28,558
No sir the world is very mean.

862
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,258
If everyone comes to know...
doing nothing, am becoming a father...

863
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,223
And if your clients spread the word...

864
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:38,096
...then mom will throw
me out of the house...

865
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,394
Why would the clients spread the news.

866
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,234
There is confidentiality
clause in the contract

867
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:49,071
Sir may I say something, I did this
just once just to keep your word...

868
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,270
...now I don't want to
make a habit out of it...

869
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,075
No no make it a habit.

870
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:53,444
Idiotic.

871
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:55,415
Yes mummy.

872
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:56,952
Did you purchase a TV

873
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:58,117
What TV

874
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,622

Yes.

877
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,459
Why aren't you speaking?
Where did you get the money from?

878
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:08,031
Ya... ya ya mom it's yours keep it.

880
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,265
Long live my Vicky.

881
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,600
Look Vicky if you've
touched my bank account...

882
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,173
...I am telling you...
don't increase my BP...

883
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,174
Ya mom I'll explain later

884
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:22,479
TV.

885
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,204
LCD!

886
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:25,543
LCD... and this is just the beginning...

887
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:29,983
Bhatia has sent the LCD in
celebration of his twins.

888
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,644
Now you wait and watch
what all you'll get both...

889
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,188
...in cash and in kind...

890
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,191
...there is much to
enjoy for a sperm like you

891
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,687
What would be the cost of LCD

892
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,423
Fifty to sixty thousand.

893
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,566
Sir why don't you understand.

894
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:46,135
Technically I have become a father...

895
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:48,329
...and it feels really strange

896
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,235
What feeling my dear

897
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,368
Just do what you feel like doing...

898
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:55,000
eat well, sleep well, and dress well...

899
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,205
...don't take stress...
it'll affect your sperms

900
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,283
All the time sperm sperm. Cant
you ever think of anything else...

901
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,747
Listen listen...

902
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,380
I get like over a
thousand biodatas everyday...

903
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,717
...with people
applying to be sperm donors...

904
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,020
...ask Chaman if you wish to...

905
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,057
If you had so much
choice why did you select me.

906
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,564
Listen... sit... sit...

907
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:21,035
...call it 20 years
experience or 6th sense...

908
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:24,332
I can tell a good sperm just
by looking at a man's face...

909
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,073
You're taking my case...

910
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,475
See your report, its brilliant.

911
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:33,079
Such DNA belong only
to the true Aryans...

your a pure Aryan... you're the
son of an Aryan you bloody...

913
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,286
...you're the son of
an Aryan you bloody...

914
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,531
Confused sperm.

915
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:51,758
Listen

916
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:55,332
Have you ever heard
the name of Alexander.

917
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,805
Your DNA belongs to his family.

918
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,232
What are you talking.

919
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,834

Map

922
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,214
What's written here...

923
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,376
The conquest of Alexander the Great

924
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:12,819
Look this is Macedonia,
Alexander's country...

925
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:15,614
from here he takes off...
continues continues...

926
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,853
reaches here Asia
Minor meaning Turkey...

927
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:21,131
from Turkey he takes off straight,
then left then again left and...

928
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,326
...then a right and reaches Persia...

929
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:28,132
...after crossing Persia... and via
Hindukush he entered into INDIA...

930
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:33,608
...but before he reached INDIA...
he had many marriages...

931
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,643
...post marriage left
his soldiers behind...

932
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,342
Alexander's soldiers
and local women had sex...

933
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:45,444
...and married each other... and
had their children... understood...

934
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,786
...and you guys came here
only after the partition right?

935
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:50,792
And Lajpat nagar Is full of refugees...

936
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:54,227
...you also are a refugee right...
so all this happened right there...

937
00:48:55,265 --> 00:49:00,430
what I am trying to say is
that you are a pure Aryan race!

938
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:04,906
Don't believe me do you... Iook
this is history and this is science...

939
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:08,406
they both go along together... parallel

940
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:10,675
I am a man of science

941
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:12,910
We can not go on together... parallel...

942
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:14,707
...just drop me home please

943
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:21,515
Listen... the sperm count of
an Aryan is best in the world.

944
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,419
I get all types of
demands from overseas...

945
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:29,792
...sperm samples of Brad Pitt,
Shahrukh Khan, Lady Gaga, Beckham.

946
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:35,361
Clients demand the sperm
samples of such celebrities...

947
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:38,266
Now you please tell me where
am I to get their samples from...

948
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,869
...but since there is a
demand we would have to meet it

949
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:43,504
How?

950
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,179
You are there na...

951
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,180
You play cricket so you are my Dhoni...

952
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,878
...handsome you already are,
so there is my Beckham...

953
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,950
you dance, sing well... there you go
- Lady Gaga...

954
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,817
and drama is inborn in us Indians...
so you become my Shahrukh...

955
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,427
...consumer is happy and
so is the manufacturer...

956
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,202
Sir increase my rate then...

957
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,773
Idiot.

958
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,401
Greedy sperm...

959
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:36,390
When this little flower
bud blooms into a plant

960
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,327
It blooms into a bud.

961
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:43,837
Hey, iPhone has come.

962
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:46,773
This is a 16GB one.

963
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,004
Dear, I had asked for a 32 GB one.

964
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:50,468
Cheers.

965
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,278
It blooms into a bud

966
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,682
And so does the demand for this...

967
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:59,779
...that and just about
everything that money can buy

968
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:00,955
Dolly Arora...

969
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:04,727
Didn't you say Rs.5,000
per month? This is 5,000...

970
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,828
From where did you get this money?

971
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:08,954
We want the best quality sperm

972
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:15,905
Don't worry about the money

973
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:20,333
We're getting demand
from foreign countries...

974
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:23,038
Give me cash.
- Cash. - Cash.

975
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:25,574
I need a good
quality Indian sperm donor.

976
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:28,350
Cash. Give me cash.

977
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:30,478
Cash.

978
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,024
Mrs. Bhatia breathe...

979
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,762
Take a deep breath...

980
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:51,774
When this little plant
turns into a big tree

981
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:55,538
Turns into a big tree

982
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:05,583
The feeling takes over to
live big, in style and live free

983
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:11,990
And so does the demand for this...

984
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:15,087
...that and just about
everything that money can buy

985
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:22,470
As the wants are unlimited
and even bigger than the sky

986
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:51,360
I am late. I will try and
make it as soon as I can.

987
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:58,465
Auto.

988
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:04,936
What are you doing madam.
Delhi is not safe in night. Come.

989
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:14,149
First CR park please

990
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:16,517
So, how's work at the bank going...

991
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:19,618
...but you have quite
an interesting job...

992
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,995
...just sit back and
count others' cash...

993
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,403
Don't you get bored...

994
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:33,541
Meaning there isn't a single guy in
the bank whom you could check out...

995
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:37,442
I go there for work,
not to check out guy

996
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:40,749
As I told you, I am not interested.

997
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,150
That's the problem... just chill...

998
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:49,090
...take life lightly... else
you'll be frustrated all life long

999
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,457
Well, am I the frustrated one or you...

1000
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:53,660
You.

1001
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:56,027
...who was checking out
those useless magazines.

1002
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,200
O.K. So I did see those magazines...

1003
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,200
but didn't buy a single one...
check if you wish to...

1004
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,902
Please Take left in the street.

1005
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:07,500
Here's your Bengali colony

1006
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:08,801
Ashima...

1007
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,913
...no bye... no thanks...

1008
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:13,639
Am not that bad...

1009
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,554
Good night.

1010
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:25,119
Sir by the way you
could have done much.

1011
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:27,756
Just take it to Lajpat Nagar

1012
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:30,089
You're a smart chap...

1013
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,827
Don't talk crap... lets go

1014
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,534
This way.

1015
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,769
Hi!

1016
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,576
Hi I am sorry I got late...
too much traffic...

1017
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:50,483
uhh should we order for lunch?

1018
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:53,818
Obviously but I
thought you would not come.

1019
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,926
Now that night you
dropped me at home safely

1020
00:54:57,027 --> 00:55:00,485
...didn't even take the money
for auto also, so one lunch is O.K.

1021
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:03,088
I was going home in the auto anyways.

1022
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,258
Anyway where do you work.

1023
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:07,662
What.

1024
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,204
Where do you work.

1025
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:14,744
I am looking for a job and for
time being I am in export import.

1026
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:16,038
Of what?

1027
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,513
Handicrafts
- Really!

1028
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:22,278
Really my dad was
working in Handicraft Emporium.

1029
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:25,077
I mean he is retired now

1030
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,654
What happened, what so funny...

1031
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:34,662
What happened, what's so funny...
so are you single

1032
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:36,893
You want to confirm
before having an affair

1033
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:40,025
No I am just asking you.

1034
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:41,728
I hardly know you.

1035
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,130
I don't want have an affair with you.

1036
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:46,969
Then how come you've come for a date.

1037
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,006
I just came.

1038
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:52,209
It is not a date.

1039
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:54,874
O.K. Leave it.

1040
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,178
Have I held you as yet

1041
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,089
You always talk like this.

1042
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,723
I talk like that also.

1043
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,257
Ma'am, your order please.

1044
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,630
There is a reason
- Bye.

1045
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:13,930

1048
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,178
There is a reason

1049
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:32,653
for this restlessness

1050
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,054
I like you

1051
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,649
this I agree to

1052
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:41,762
There was once some disinterest

1053
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:42,729
Hello.

1054
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:47,326
Now I have found peace, limitless

1055
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:50,636
Bye.

1056
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:54,838
Let me be lost
- I am getting late.

1057
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:56,241
Today no bank

1058
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:57,870
Why... I never bunked

1059
00:56:58,148 --> 00:56:59,376
There is always a first day.

1060
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:00,616
But why?

1061
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:02,241
Yeah, tomorrow...

1062
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:06,080
She is having a burger. Call later.

1063
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,123
Daily bunk for one or
two hours... it'll help

1064
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:12,627
It's time to love you

1065
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:16,665
Let me be lost

1066
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,663
Let me lose myself

1067
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,262
Let me be lost

1068
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,201
Let me lose myself

1069
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:28,637
It's not the weather, it's the heart

1070
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:33,340
You are unique, the rest is useless

1071
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,746
You are unique, the rest is useless

1072
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:38,317
You are unique, the rest is useless

1073
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:43,658
You are unique

1074
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:48,788
Let me be lost

1075
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:53,359
Let me lose myself

1076
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:58,770
Let me be lost

1077
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:00,766
Panditji what happened?

1078
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:05,971
Vicky Pepsi aunty was
asking me what you do.

1079
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,410
I told her to ask you herself.

1080
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:11,448
Whatever you all are planning,
send it out of boundary.

1081
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:13,450
See my dear there is no hurry.

1082
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,748
But one thing let me tell you...

1083
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:20,262
...that I really think you and
Sweta look really sweet together

1084
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:24,925
See son now you have
started earning, so get married.

1085
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:26,902
Today your telling me to get married...

1086
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,867
...tomorrow you'll
tell me to have kids...

1087
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:29,404
Right.

1088
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:33,704
If its only about kids, then I
can have them today itself...

1089
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,142
Vicky.

1090
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:50,960
Why did you kiss me and all of that?

1091
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:54,725
That night I was drunk, after
that have I ever touched you...

1092
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,355
...put on your dupatta

1093
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:59,367
Put on my dupatta...
Why're you ignoring me.

1094
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,766
You were drunk just that one night...

1095
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:02,838
...what about the other nights.

1096
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:05,737
What other nights. I
never touched you.

1097
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,173
Did I ever stop you.

1098
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,369
See the door is open,
somebody could see us...

1099
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:13,472
what are you doing... get away from me

1100
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,977
Look if you don't want to
do marriage now then O.K.

1101
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:22,747
I will convince to mummy, but don't
break our relationship in this way...

1102
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,326
What relationship...

1103
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:26,520
I have already told you that
we are just childhood friends

1104
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:27,888
don't raise false hopes...

1105
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:30,966
So you do all that with a friend
that one should do with a girlfriend.

1106
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,138
Aren't you feeling anything...

1107
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:42,139
...just troubling me aren't you...
or you've found somebody else...

1108
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,876
There's no one else...

1109
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:47,480
...and even If there is why
should I tell you... bloody pile on...

1110
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,544
Hooo... when that you've
done everything with me...

1111
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:51,377
...I've become a pile on

1112
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,783
I even given you all my pocket money...

1113
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:54,982
now you give me back all my money

1114
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,389
There... shown your real self...

1115
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:00,387
Bloody typical C block mentality...
here take this...

1116
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:02,157
...here here take all your money...
haven't even counted it

1117
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:06,061
I will take my money and
now you see... what I do...

1118
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:08,262
I will tell everything to aunty...
open up all your secrets

1119
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:10,362
What you will tell.

1120
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:13,033
Yes I know everything
about you and the doctor...

1121
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:14,803
I know all that's going on
between the two of you...

1122
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:16,071
What do you know.

1123
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:20,115
That you're getting
your treatment done

1124
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:25,882
Treatment... hahahah... Go,
go, tell everyone...

1125
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:28,822
Yes I will tell to the
entire colony and you go to hell.

1126
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:31,917
You go to hell. You take your money.

1127
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:33,829
Now I'll show you
when you come to me...

1128
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:35,295
And one more thing...

1129
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:41,027
One day or other all this
will come out in the open.

1130
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:48,209
I've become habituated to
earning quick money thanks to you...

1131
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:50,470
What is wrong in this?

1132
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:53,847
As it is what does a boyfriend and
girl friend do with each other...

1133
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:54,439
Why?

1134
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:58,418
Eating burgers at Wimpy's.
Some kisses... some touching...

1135
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:02,389
...now they aren't going to have
kids right... all wastage of sperm...

1136
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:06,925
Listen now you be away from all these.

1137
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:08,390
All the time

1138
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:13,333
You land up connecting such
diverse topics with each other...

1139
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:15,996
If I listen to you... I'll
land up dying a bachelor

1140
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,935
Come on yourjob.

1141
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:29,006
Me, hi I'm on the treadmill...

1142
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,512
...what are you doing in parlour?

1143
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:33,179
Hadn't you refused me?
Are you out of your mind?

1144
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:35,553
You hang in there, am coming.
Stay there. Okay bye.

1145
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:38,158
What are you doing here?

1146
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:41,492
Extremely sorry sir, not
today please next time double

1147
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:43,087
Just give a little bit.

1148
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:44,926
Give some atleast...

1149
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:47,934
Hey have called for some
sweets from Tiwaris...

1150
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,197
Send them home...

1151
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:58,038
Ma'am, your driver is waiting...

1152
01:01:58,147 --> 01:01:59,205
Leave that.

1153
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:00,914
Mom... here's the money...

1154
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:02,915
Thank you aunty I will be back. Bye.

1155
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:11,149
O stranger from distant lands

1156
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:18,397
Your home is across the seas...
O, dear foreigner

1157
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:22,665
I could not understand anything...
but you sing beautifully...

1158
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,234
This was mom's favourite song...

1159
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,203
...5 year's back she died,
since then...

1160
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,437
Sir tea

1161
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,646
In the house there's
only myself, dad and Peeshi

1162
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:37,309
One thing's for sure...

1163
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:41,189
...your children will become singers

1164
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:42,552
Meaning

1165
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:46,560
Genes, after all they
will have an effect.

1166
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:50,299
Well do you love children.

1167
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:51,565
You love kids.

1168
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,067
I'm ok

1169
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:55,699
I love kids

1170
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:57,472
You love kids
- I love them.

1171
01:02:57,673 --> 01:03:01,040
I am also a kid only.

1172
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:09,017
Unsaid things get colored

1173
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:16,217
You start calling a
person your very own

1174
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,491
Sir its coming switched off.

1175
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:26,228
Yes.

1176
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:31,530
Suddenly how come you
made a plan to meet?

1177
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:34,509
I want to tell you something.

1178
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:37,337
Tell me.

1179
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,376
I am a divorcee

1180
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:49,686
I knew it. I knew there
had to be something...

1181
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:52,161
...that you're forever cranky...

1182
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,296
What's the story?

1183
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:59,465
3 years back we had
an arranged marriage.

1184
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:02,538
The boy was from DU. A Banker.

1185
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:04,697
Oh would be earning well.

1186
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:09,403
Sorry then what happened.

1187
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:14,138
Nothing, on our first night of
marriage, I came to know that...

1188
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:20,616
...he loved somebody else and
married me only under family pressure.

1189
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:22,715
I don't know why he kept it a secret.

1190
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:24,224
Should have told me.

1191
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:28,127
They are sissies... Bengalis

1192
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,562
I am not like that.

1193
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:31,064
What happened after that?

1194
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:34,603
Nothing, caught an auto in
the middle of the night...

1195
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,435
...and came back to my house.

1196
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,398
He did not even find it
necessary to drop me home.

1197
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:43,410
Ha, that's not a marriage there,
you didn't even have sex...

1198
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,771
Besides you had to
spend on the bridals...

1199
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,509
Giving back to Mother is a 50'/,

1200
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:53,655
Well when you meet mom,
avoid the divorce matter.

1201
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:59,823
Why. - We're Punjabis...
conservative... not modern like you'll

1202
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,588
And you.

1203
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:08,293
Everything is cool for me.

1204
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:11,263
Do you have a secret...

1205
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:14,576
No.

1206
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:17,403
735 friends on Orkut

1207
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:19,808
750 on Facebook...

1208
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,383
And this is the profile picture

1209
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,785
All details are totally correct.
You can check it whenever...

1210
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:27,783
Why are we here...

1211
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:31,557
...what do you want from me.

1212
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,199
Don't know Ashima...

1213
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:45,566
But since I've met you... I
feel I can't live without...

1214
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:48,877
It's like you've become a habit...
first when I met you at the bank...

1215
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:53,481
I was like what kind of girl
is she... then I was like...

1216
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:58,316
...no however she is...
she's just fine...

1217
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:01,347
...to make you smile sort of
became my responsibility...

1218
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:03,723
...after dropping you at
home in the evening...

1219
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:05,885
...and then picking
you up in the morning...

1220
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:10,728
...and the time in between...
bloody just doesn't pass...

1221
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,227
...but why've you
asking me all this...

1222
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:18,473
Because even I have fallen for you.

1223
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:26,612
I want to marry you.

1224
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:31,819
I want kids a family...

1225
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:39,452
...but that's ok...
it's not necessary...

1226
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,192
...for you to have similar feelings...

1227
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,425
Maybe you don't want to settle down...

1228
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:49,329
So you can let me know

1229
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:54,934
Come, let's go to your
Kaalibadi and get married.

1230
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,679
I am serious Vicky.

1231
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:01,943
I am also serious.

1232
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:11,381
Listen... this
'Peeshi' in your house...

1233
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:13,919
Is she your cat or dog...

1234
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:21,232
Peeshi means aunt.

1235
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:28,770
Do you drink

1236
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:43,724
The purity of water

1237
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:48,622
The purity of water

1238
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:51,899
It's nice... a little blue though

1239
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:53,632
Sit comfortably

1240
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,334
I like it...

1241
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:57,531
Really?

1242
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:02,403
Brings a tear to my eyes

1243
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:04,536
Brings a tear to my eyes

1244
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:11,611
My beloved didn't show up

1245
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:16,822
My beloved didn't show up

1246
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,360
My love didn't show up

1247
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:21,657
My beloved didn't show up

1248
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:24,355
My beloved didn't show up

1249
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,332
My love didn't show up

1250
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:30,337
You know what a
drunken bengalan looks...

1251
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:31,997
Take a look at yourself in the mirror.

1252
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:36,838
You are drunk

1253
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,072
Father's at home...

1254
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:40,312
Peeshi?

1255
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:45,520
So do we play ludo sitting here?

1256
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:53,326
Your absence has made me go crazy

1257
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:55,659
Come back, my beloved

1258
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,959
Your absence has made me go crazy

1259
01:08:58,067 --> 01:09:00,627
Come back, my beloved

1260
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:03,034
Seasons have come and gone

1261
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,334
You still haven't come, my love

1262
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,336
O intro... get out of here...

1263
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,808
You still haven't come, my love

1264
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:14,576
When I saw your divine eyes

1265
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:20,084
When I saw your divine eyes

1266
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:23,615
A tear came to my eye

1267
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:28,563
A tear came to my eye

1268
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:33,568
A tear came to my eye

1269
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:37,867
On the terrace when we would meet

1270
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:40,100
I will call you.
- Ok. Correct...

1271
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:43,435
Bye
- Bye

1272
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:49,746
I'm crazy about you. I love you

1273
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:53,512
You won't find anyone like me

1274
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:58,518
Forego the world and come back to me

1275
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:03,754
Forego the world and come back to me

1276
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:07,096
Brings a tear to my eyes

1277
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,671
A tear came to my eye

1278
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:12,036
A tear came to my eye

1279
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:14,575
A tear came to my eye

1280
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:17,168
A tear came to my eye

1281
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,878
What is all this
going on in your life.

1282
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:22,882
Nothing.

1283
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:25,715
Lying doesn't suit you

1284
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:28,156
Who is this Ashima.

1285
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:31,187
We are getting married

1286
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:35,156
Listen... dating and
shating is fine...

1287
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:37,898
...chilling out, going out
Is fine... but marriage.

1288
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:42,002
Listen understand the
importance of bachelorhood...

1289
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:45,937
In bachelorhood you can eat when
you want, drink when you want...

1290
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:49,977
...the toothpaste cap will
remain wherever you left it...

1291
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,639
...but after marriage
you'll lose this freedom.

1292
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:56,443
And from the client's point of view
the value of bachelor's sperm is...

1293
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:58,144
Every time you just talk
about sperm... sperm... sperm

1294
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,946
It's been four years... my
mind has gotten rusted...

1295
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:04,557
Rise above the sperm
there is a heart also.

1296
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:08,822
Chaddha sir what about love?

1297
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:25,137
Bye.

1298
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:38,125
Your dad's never
going to accept this...

1299
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:40,221
Why Peeshi ma?

1300
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:43,965
Why... you know don't talk
like as if you don't understand...

1301
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:48,968
North Indian... aethe uthey kithey...
oh god... ssss...

1302
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:50,695
cant even think about it...

1303
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:54,501
you know they don't even take off
the price tags from their clothes...

1304
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:57,677
and then they'll say
'Oh I made a mistake... '

1305
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:59,876
Ok just meet him once

1306
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:02,677
No this match is NOT possible at all

1307
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,247
Showed you so many girls...

1308
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,153
and finally you chose to
find yourself a Bengali...

1309
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:09,747
Ashima Roy... have you lost it?

1310
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,017
Her name itself is so bitter,
what'll she be like...

1311
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,296
do you know how
dominating these girls are...

1312
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,528
and why do I have to
adjust everytime...

1313
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,794
I am not going to adjust
this time, I will not...

1314
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:24,069
...first get dominated by in
laws then by this Bengali bride...

1315
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,664
...listen carefully, only a
Punjabi bride will enter this house...

1316
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:28,675
...and that too a fair & pretty one...

1317
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,540
else go get married all by yourself!

1318
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:35,183
Even if no one goes, I will
definitely go to your marriage...

1319
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:37,252
and that too wearing
a suit by Ritu Kumar

1320
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,184
Grandmom, you don't interfere...
please don't...

1321
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:41,620
I have only one son... and
he'll get a Bengali bride?

1322
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:44,325
Listen they are really big misers...

1323
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:48,188
I challenge you, show me one
such Bengali in the whole world...

1324
01:12:48,297 --> 01:12:50,765
...who lives like us...
with a big heart...

1325
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:54,263
...and their food... FISH...

01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,838

1327
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:58,839

1328
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:00,738
Mom please ya...

1329
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:02,572
I am not going to
meet that Bengali woman

1330
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:04,009
She is not typical.

1331
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:05,740
Everytime something good happens...

1332
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:08,678
...she has to spread sadness...
that's her habit

1333
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:10,775
Your grandfather, wanted
to make you a sardar...

1334
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,285
I was the one who opposed it...

1335
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:16,085
...and now this Bengali woman,
she's going to make you a monkey...

1336
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:18,284
...will make you wear a
monkey cap and rubber chappals...

1337
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:23,764
then don't come to me crying...
momma save me... save me, help help help

1338
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:28,200
Ignore all that... you tell me...
does she look like Moon Moon Sen?

1339
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:29,327
Better than that...

1340
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:30,263
Ya...

1341
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:31,339

1342
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:32,664

01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:33,605
Show me...

1344
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:34,369
Here

1345
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:39,774
Oh dear god, looks so pretty...
like a princess... touchwood...

1346
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:45,812
...can I give you a surprise?

1347
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:50,717
I am going to sponsor
your honeymoon trip...

1348
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:52,954
Oye why did you stop this... continue.

1349
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:55,819
What is this you are doing?

1350
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:58,630
You know I hate North Indians...

1351
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:03,103
I mean you're an independent, modern,
smart, Bengali woman...

1352
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:07,332
and he ARORA, Punjabi!

1353
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:11,203
We have our culture, literature,
music...

1354
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:13,713
...this just won't match,
no match at all...

1355
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:19,880
bloody money minded business
class (Making fun) balley balley...

1356
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,919
and you want to do that monkey dance

1357
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:26,222
...that's right baba... that's
exactly what I want to do...

1358
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:29,192
...and what culture
are you talking about?

1359
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:32,030
About that son-in-law of
yours who didn't have the guts...

1360
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,135
...to speak the truth that he
already loved somebody else...

1361
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:37,761
...he was your cultured,
well read Bengali... right?

1362
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:41,339
Vicky's not like that... he
genuinely cares for me baba...

1363
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:45,140
That's because he has some personal
agenda... they are selfish people

1364
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:47,681
Ya he does have an agenda baba...
he wants to marry me

1365
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:48,977
Where does he work?

1366
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:50,783
Own business.

1367
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:52,012
What?

1368
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:55,281
No no this marriage cannot happen...

1369
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:59,827
...your uncle's son-in-law,
can't you find a boy like him...

1370
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:01,359
I don't care papa...

1371
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:04,398
That is why I told you
not to settle in Delhi.

1372
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:06,832
You keep quiet...
your also responsible...

1373
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:09,028

Here have this fish

1376
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:21,380
Fish... a man's character can be
known from the way he buys his fish...

1377
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,417
...he has to pass the fish test first.

1378
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,181
He does not eat fish.

1379
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:30,052
Couldn't you find a
Bengali boy to fall in love with?

1380
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:35,226
Best of the Bengali boys wants to
marry you... doctor, engineer...

1381
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:38,891
They are good looking... smart...
well behaved...

01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:42,162
they are good lovers... too... yes...

1383
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:45,899

1384
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:49,273
...what do you think,
they are not good in bed.

1385
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:50,811
What're you saying...

1386
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:54,280
I'm saying the right thing...
they are good in sex also

1387
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:01,419
I was...

1388
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:05,019
if your mom was alive...
she would have told you...

1389
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:10,963
when I used to hug her tight...
she would ummm feel shy...

1390
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:14,461
...and ask me to loosen up...

1391
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:17,904
...and don't tell me
Punjabis are better than us.

1392
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:31,815
When do you want to meet him?

1393
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:37,790
What will I do
visiting those bengalis...

1394
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,551
...sorry but I can't come...

1395
01:16:39,828 --> 01:16:41,386
No no I wasn't telling you...

1396
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,792
Pack me 4 portions of
chole-puri with extra choley...

1397
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:46,026
...ya I'm coming you keep the phone...

1398
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:47,460
Sorry friend sorry.

1399
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:51,164
Sir, you tell me not to get
married While you yourself have a wife...

1400
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:53,035
No no she's not my wife...

1401
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:56,338
...she's my maid
servant since 32 years...

1402
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,844
...now she behaves like a wife
inspite of a being a maid...

1403
01:16:57,946 --> 01:16:59,311
...so as good as a wife...

1404
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:01,807
Sorry dear

1405
01:17:02,317 --> 01:17:04,842
Fine don't come... but never
try calling me ever again...

1406
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,947
I hate Punjabis.

1407
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:11,821
I can understand.

1408
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,327
...our nature is different...
and further more they are Aroras...

1409
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:20,831
...didn't I tell you these
Bengalis don't like us Punjabis

1410
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:22,994
I hate Delhi also.

1411
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:26,106
Sir, which means you
haven't seen Delhi well enough...

1412
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:30,445
I am happy in my CR
Park my Bengali colony.

1413
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:33,911
By the way... that too is Delhi sir

1414
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:36,973
Are you his uncle?

1415
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:41,215
No no business partner
professional uncle you can say.

1416
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:42,448
What is your business.

1417
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:46,961
Trading Trading... no investments...
only profits

1418
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:50,226
Sir... you didn't tell
us why you hate Punjabis

1419
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:54,928
Because we believe in simplicity... Not
like Punjabis who are only show offs.

1420
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:58,632
I agree with you madam... Our
cultures just don't match...

1421
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:02,365
I was explaining him this only
that there will be a problem...

1422
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:04,205
See understanding

1423
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:06,143
Sir understanding is
very important sir...

1424
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:08,944
If the two of us have an understanding
all problems will get solved...

1425
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:11,550
...and I know a
little bit about Bengalis

1426
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,946
I see what do you know about Bengalis.

1427
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:16,485
They love fish...

1428
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:20,927
Sir, they're intelligent...

1429
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:22,394
jana gana mana adhinayak...

1430
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:26,900
...our national anthem was written
by gurudev Rabindra Nath Tagore...

1431
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:30,366
and sir Mohan... football

1432
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,200
Football Mohan Bagan

1433
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:33,433
Sir, that guy plays brilliant football

1434
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:36,670
Guy... it's a team,
it's a football team...

1435
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:40,537
He made a team... and
your 'elder sister' sir

1436
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:43,379
elder sister... elder sister Mamata

1437
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:47,979
Ya... that very same elder sister
is the 11th chief minister of Bengal

1438
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:54,925
Sorry, sir.

1439
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:01,696
Tuna.

1440
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:03,464
Yes Baba

1441
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,005
Bring the tea

1442
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:10,068
I'll bring the starters

1443
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:16,515
Mrs. Arora I hope Vicky has
informed you that Ashima is a divorcee

1444
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:19,209
Divorcee? Vicky you didn't...

1445
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,149
This is too much.

1446
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:27,527
Oh such a fine girl... you
don't look like it at all...

1447
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:30,655
anyways all for good... that
fellow's loss and Vicky's gain...

1448
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:34,093
Now whatever grandmom
decides would be the final word

1449
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:35,669
Listen you don't have
any children do you...

1450
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:38,968
O grandmom, what's the difference,
we either say yes or no...

1451
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:40,701
whichever way lets decide fast...
what's the big deal!

1452
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:42,340
For me she's absolutely Ok...

1453
01:19:42,577 --> 01:19:46,570
Dolly for me she's absolutely fine...

1454
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:50,050
You know Dolly... Vicky's mother...

1455
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:53,246
Vicky's father Gurmeet
passed away very young...

1456
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:55,983
...and she became a
widow at a very young age...

1457
01:19:56,158 --> 01:20:00,060
if it was upto me I would
have gotten her remarried...

1458
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:01,993
why spend your whole life sad & alone?

1459
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:04,122
I appreciate your
progressive thinking.

1460
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:05,358
Thank you.

1461
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:09,669
If Vicky's fine, then even
we don't have any problem...

1462
01:20:09,771 --> 01:20:13,138
after all we're also modern people...
right... congratulations dear...

1463
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:15,266
Your husband didn't come ma'am

1464
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:19,040
Oh I never married...
ummm... I didn't find the right man

1465
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:20,478
Oh... you should have told me...

1466
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:22,641
I would have lined up
right men for you...

1467
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:26,282
Mr. Rai there must be
tremendous pressure on you

1468
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:27,184
Why?

1469
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:29,655
Daughter is a
divorcee and sister bachelor

1470
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:31,020
And you widow.

1471
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:32,024
You...

1472
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:33,082
How old must you be

1473
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:36,221
Excuse me, can we
talk about the wedding

1474
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:40,199
See, we don't want a loud marriage...
not loud at all...

1475
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:42,600
and the marriage should
follow the Bengali traditions

1476
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:45,264
No no no no... the marriage will
be done by Punjabi traditions...

1477
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:47,238
...after all it's our
son's first marriage...

1478
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:51,506
so many known people...
they're all waiting to be invited...

1479
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:53,704
and please do invite a DJ

1480
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:55,113
DJ...

1481
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:57,308
No no no what is she saying

1482
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:59,080
Listen dear... you keep quiet...

1483
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:00,814
...you now belong to
the Arora family...

1484
01:21:01,089 --> 01:21:04,581
...let these bongs speak what
they wish to... uh anything else

1485
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:09,255
See... all this drinking and all that
goes on in your Punjabi marriages...

1486
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:13,266
I personally feel that all that
should not happen in a marriage ceremony

1487
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:16,360
Our family really does not like that.

1488
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:23,743
Where are the beer bottles

1489
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:31,718
Look through the window of your eyes

1490
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:38,682
Measure it on the
balance scale of your heart

1491
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:45,259
Look through the window of your eyes

1492
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:48,393
Measure it on the
balance scale of your heart

1493
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:53,202
You will not find
someone like me no matter...

1494
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:56,270
...where in the world you search...

1495
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:59,108
search... search

1496
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:02,206
search... search

1497
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:03,875
You people open da door

I manna burn da floor

1499
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:06,848
What is this.

1500
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:08,383
He's become a loser

1501
01:22:09,157 --> 01:22:12,786
Get mixed in our lives and its colour

1502
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:15,628
Could not she find a
better Bengali boy.

1503
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:18,631
Look how they're dancing,
like monkeys.

1504
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:21,634
Oye pigs, stop this, the
ceremony is about to begin.

1505
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:26,268
Get mixed in our lives and its colour

1506
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:27,705
Why're they taking her round and round

1507
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:29,367
Hope she doesn't fell giddy...

1508
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:31,877
Hello Mr. Chaddha everything is fine.

1509
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,169
Great... enjoy

1510
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:36,409
This is all a wastage of money,
wastage of sperm.

1511
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:39,851

1512
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:43,349

1517
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,263
Yes, yes, I am coming.

1518
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:59,196
Bunty bring on the
liquor bottles from the car...

1519
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:02,435
I never wanted Tuna to get
married in a Punjabi family...

1520
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:05,908
...but now I think she
has made the right choice.

1521
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:09,550
Both are looking so cute.

1522
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:12,242
Peeshima what is this.
This is very simple.

1523
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:14,447
There would be bulb in your house...

1524
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:18,192
so remove the bulb...
and put it down...

1525
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:22,889
We are happy and we keep
everyone happy. Come with me.

1526
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:24,556
Where where Mrs. Arora

1527
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:26,963
And wear their untamed
hearts on their sleeves

1528
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:34,303
You will not find
someone like me no matter...

1529
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:37,303
...where in the world you search...

1530
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:39,903
search... search

1531
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:43,746
search... search

1532
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:01,662
Your dad's gone balle balle

1533
01:24:20,455 --> 01:24:23,515
Mrs. Arora chicken
curry was out of the world.

1534
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:25,718
Thank you thank you. What
I was saying was that...

1535
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:28,762
...the terrace room is not
big enough for the two of you

1536
01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:31,696
...why don't we take a two
bedroom flat some where nearby.

1537
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,529
No mummy we will manage. Why Vicky.

1538
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:35,398
Mrs. Arora listen I am
shifting to Kolkata...

1539
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,366
...and the entire house will be empty.

1540
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:38,867
They can easily shift there.

1541
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:40,838
No no but they will be away from us.

1542
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:42,739
Whose phone is it?

1543
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:44,602
See...

1544
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:46,008
Dr. Chaddha you're
really strange I've...

1545
01:24:46,314 --> 01:24:47,872
...just been married...
don't you have any patience...

1546
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:50,951
See this is a politician
family and I am under pressure.

1547
01:24:51,052 --> 01:24:53,748
Don't refuse, this is a big deal
and I have already made a commitment.

1548
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:55,482
If you refuse, I'll
be in big trouble...

1549
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:56,852
And What about the problem that'II...

1550
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,926
Vicky relax... think with cool mind.

1551
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:01,552
On a later day, if this child
becomes tomorrow's Prime Minister...

1552
01:25:01,663 --> 01:25:04,632
...then you can proudly say Vicky
Arora's son is the Prime Minister.

1553
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:05,630
Who are you explaining to?

1554
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,668
Listen stop giving me this crap...

1555
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:13,866
The risk has increased... you will
cause a break up in my marriage.

1556
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:18,307
Complicated sperm.

1557
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:23,476
Hurry up.

1558
01:25:24,052 --> 01:25:24,950
Two minutes.

1559
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:26,315
Okay, I will get it.

1560
01:25:27,722 --> 01:25:30,316
Have some shame... and tell
that Dr. Chaddha never again...

1561
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:31,517
Go now...

1562
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:32,888
Come on

1563
01:25:32,994 --> 01:25:33,892
Who?
- No one.

1564
01:25:33,995 --> 01:25:34,893
Ready

1565
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:36,054
Come on

1566
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:38,525
Who was that man?

1567
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:39,998
No one...

1568
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:48,407
Moments... these moments...

1569
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:51,812
These moments of mine...

1570
01:25:52,514 --> 01:25:55,381
This is our exotic
honeymoon destination.

1571
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:56,878
Yes yes absolutely O.K. Bye

1572
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,680
People go to Bangkok
and we've come to Kolkata

1573
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:01,419
So how do we like it.

1574
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:05,616
Feels good... just place a
bed here... in the open air

1575
01:26:05,727 --> 01:26:06,853
Ok.

1576
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:12,389
This mosquito net, reminds
me of cricket's net practice

1577
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,401
I will die without you

1578
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:21,965
I will die without you

1579
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:29,006
I will die without you

1580
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:35,647
I will die without you

1581
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,753
This was just net practice...

1582
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:40,653
...lets play again...

1583
01:26:40,762 --> 01:26:44,163
I will die without you

1584
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:46,430
Mummy drinks

1585
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:50,837
After dad's death she
became very Ionely...

1586
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:56,510
so gets relaxed taking one
or two pegs... feels good...

1587
01:26:56,778 --> 01:26:58,905
That's true cool ya

1588
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:03,615
You know I wish to change my
profession, start something new

1589
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:04,946
Why?

1590
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:06,181
Its enough.

1591
01:27:06,454 --> 01:27:07,751
Don't feel interested...

1592
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:10,756
But there is money in
your account. I've seen it

1593
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:15,886
Any way whatever makes you happy...

1594
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:19,933
...meanwhile drop me to the bank
and in the evening pick me up...

1595
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:22,866
Just like that Vicky has flown away...

1596
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:26,099
...gone out of our hands...

1597
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:28,870
How much more would you use him...

1598
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:31,669
...now get used to being without
him... look for someone else...

1599
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,904
if we can get 5-6 months
more with him, be grateful...

1600
01:27:34,115 --> 01:27:36,015
I won't be coming tomorrow...

1601
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:38,914
Pain in the sperm.

1602
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:45,584
Doctor will be
available tomorrow morning.

1603
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:47,727
Excuse me where does Dr. Shobha sit

1604
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:49,626
Third row from left.

1605
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:55,930
Ashima are you fine?

1606
01:27:56,604 --> 01:27:57,935
Are you fine?

1607
01:28:00,508 --> 01:28:03,534
Why are you crying... tell
me what did the doctor say?

1608
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:10,244
Ashima has tubal blockage.

1609
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:11,917
I have read her reports...

1610
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,953
...she would never
conceive in the natural process

1611
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:17,681
Doctor she's still quite young...

1612
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:20,754
...there must be some
treatment or way-out.

1613
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:23,023
I understand your point Mr. Arora...

1614
01:28:23,164 --> 01:28:26,656
...but some times the body is just
not well equipped for the pregnancy.

1615
01:28:27,068 --> 01:28:29,536
I would not like to give
you any false hopes...

1616
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:32,501
...but right now you
need to support Ashima...

1617
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:35,599
...emotional and psychologically...

1618
01:28:47,722 --> 01:28:49,656
Vicky don'tjoke with me.

1619
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:54,127
Never.

1620
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:01,098
What happened.

1621
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:08,074
Tuna can not have baby.

1622
01:29:11,045 --> 01:29:12,672
Is she alright.

1623
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:16,744
Ashima say something...

1624
01:29:17,752 --> 01:29:21,620
What do I say...

1625
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:27,718
...the entire world
can have kids except me

1626
01:29:28,129 --> 01:29:29,994
Don't think like this. Its destiny.

1627
01:29:30,965 --> 01:29:32,125
Destiny?

1628
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:36,064
This is my destiny.

1629
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:39,803
You're speaking as if I
haven't tried hard enough...

1630
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:42,570
We'll consult some other doctor.

1631
01:29:44,345 --> 01:29:46,575
Haven't a child is
not everything is it...

1632
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:50,577
But for me it is.

1633
01:29:51,986 --> 01:29:53,578
Our child...

1634
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:57,749
...half punjabi, half Bengali...

1635
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,727
...half Delhi, half Kolkata...

1636
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:08,896
...half Vicky and half Ashima...

1637
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:12,662
If you keep crying like this...
even I feel really bad...

1638
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:16,275
to divert the mind...

1639
01:30:17,178 --> 01:30:19,043
...let's go out some where...
let's sit there and discuss...

1640
01:30:19,147 --> 01:30:20,614
Okay?

1641
01:30:48,342 --> 01:30:51,402
Such things happen
in today's life style.

1642
01:30:52,413 --> 01:30:53,937
What can we do...

1643
01:30:54,048 --> 01:30:56,243
Listen adopt.

1644
01:30:56,684 --> 01:30:59,676
Grandmom our blood is
our own after all...

1645
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:06,090
See I am the head of family,
rest is upto Ashima...

1646
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,652
Grandmom there are only
two things modern in Delhi...

1647
01:31:10,731 --> 01:31:13,859
...one is Metro and other you.

1648
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,827
You know I don't know
about this adoption and all.

1649
01:31:16,938 --> 01:31:18,803
I have not thought about it.

1650
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:21,340
I don't know whether we will
be able to give so much love...

1651
01:31:21,442 --> 01:31:22,909
...to another's child

1652
01:31:24,378 --> 01:31:26,710
I don't know. Anyways
I'm feeling sleepy...

1653
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:31,979
Vicky this is only
my report, not yours.

1654
01:31:32,386 --> 01:31:35,048
Where are your reports?
We did your tests right.

1655
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:38,314
No.

1656
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:39,982
What?

1657
01:31:40,428 --> 01:31:41,360
No.

1658
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:42,922
Why not.

1659
01:31:44,065 --> 01:31:45,999
What problem would I have? I am fine.

1660
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:47,692
How can you be so sure?

1661
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:49,793
Every one will think
that I have a problem...

1662
01:31:49,904 --> 01:31:51,132
What if there is
some problem with you...

1663
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:52,399
Fine, we'll do it tomorrow.
Don't get stressed

1664
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:54,372
No one minute... the question is
not that we'll do it tomorrow...

1665
01:31:54,475 --> 01:31:57,342
...the question is why didn't you
get you're your tests done. Why?

1666
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:05,885
Because... earlier I was
used to donate sperm...

1667
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:11,248
I was a sperm donor...
I was a sperm donor...

1668
01:32:22,970 --> 01:32:24,733
It was before marriage.

1669
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:33,108
So what about those...
handicrafts... Trading business.

1670
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:40,248
Oh now I get it...

1671
01:32:40,988 --> 01:32:44,924
Why didn't not tell me... I am a
divorcee... still I told you right.

1672
01:32:45,126 --> 01:32:47,026
It was a marriage of only a
few hours still I told you...

1673
01:32:47,094 --> 01:32:49,289
...because I wanted you to
know everything about my life.

1674
01:32:49,964 --> 01:32:52,228
How could you hide such
a big thing from me...

1675
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,391
Why is it so important
for you men to hide things.

1676
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:56,099
Look at me when I am talking to you.

1677
01:32:56,337 --> 01:32:57,463
What would I have told you...

1678
01:32:57,572 --> 01:32:59,767
No you think now I will understand.

1679
01:33:00,808 --> 01:33:02,298
What would I have told you...
that I donate sperm.

1680
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:04,936
I used to get myself
tested for pregnancy...

1681
01:33:05,546 --> 01:33:07,537
It would come out negative...
I used to cry for hours...

1682
01:33:07,815 --> 01:33:09,783
And you used to, very
calmly console me...

1683
01:33:10,851 --> 01:33:14,287
now I know why... you
were already had children

1684
01:33:14,388 --> 01:33:18,449
They are not my children
only my sperm was used.

1685
01:33:19,193 --> 01:33:23,061
Did it because of that Dr. Chaddha...
and later... first it was for money

1686
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:29,492
Sorry, you did it for money.

1687
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:34,074
Oh God.

1688
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:36,943
Its disgusting Vicky.

1689
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:41,547
Why didn't you tell me.

1690
01:33:43,517 --> 01:33:45,985
Look now I made a mistake...
now what do I do...

1691
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:50,822
I am not interested just
tell me why didn't you tell me.

1692
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:55,194
What would I have told you.

1693
01:33:55,329 --> 01:33:56,819
Did you do it after marriage also?

1694
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:03,561
Didn't go to the clinic
but Dr. Chaddha's man...

1695
01:34:03,871 --> 01:34:05,099
...used to come home
to collect the sample...

1696
01:34:10,077 --> 01:34:11,544
Move move...

1697
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:18,178
Now, what's the point
in sleeping separately.

1698
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:19,547
Husband wife have such problems.

1699
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,480
And trust if that
itself does not remain.

1700
01:34:23,457 --> 01:34:25,618
I can not sleep with you any more.

1701
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:28,224
I can not sleep with a
man who shags for money.

1702
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:31,630
I feel so stupid... You
kept doing all this...

1703
01:34:31,899 --> 01:34:33,389
...just didn't come to know.

1704
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:37,936
Earlier I did it for money but later

1705
01:34:38,005 --> 01:34:41,099
O.K. Fine when you felt that you
were doing it for social service...

1706
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:42,470
...then you could have told me...

1707
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:44,377
...may be I could have understood...

1708
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:48,312
And where are your children.
I want to meet them... now.

1709
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:50,543
How you can just meet them...
it's... It's a contract.

1710
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:52,609
What contract... I am your wife.
You're my husband...

1711
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,251
...they are your
children and I can meet them.

1712
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:55,650
I want to meet them now.
I don't know...

1713
01:34:56,223 --> 01:34:57,884
I don't care just now.

1714
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:03,595
What are you searching for.

1715
01:35:04,398 --> 01:35:05,558
Boroline.

1716
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:06,997
Why.

1717
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:09,233
What's it to you... I want it.

1718
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:31,157
Not going to the bank.

1719
01:35:33,627 --> 01:35:34,958
Move...

1720
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:42,931
Ashima.

1721
01:35:43,037 --> 01:35:44,197
Ashima.

1722
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:07,223
The purity of water

1723
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:12,990
The purity of water

1724
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:14,594
Yes mummy.

1725
01:36:14,702 --> 01:36:17,102
Police is here, they are
saying that you have black money...

1726
01:36:17,204 --> 01:36:18,398
...and they have come to take that.

1727
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:20,235
This is only a beauty parlour...

1728
01:36:20,341 --> 01:36:21,706
...or some other
facility is also available.

1729
01:36:22,009 --> 01:36:23,442
Excuse me, how're you
speaking with the lady...

1730
01:36:23,544 --> 01:36:24,533
Are you Vicky.

1731
01:36:24,645 --> 01:36:25,543
Mummy you go inside

1732
01:36:25,646 --> 01:36:28,513
Just tell me where
did all this come from.

1733
01:36:28,582 --> 01:36:30,607
I have purchased it,
don't people give gifts...

1734
01:36:30,718 --> 01:36:31,685
It is gift.
- Yes

1735
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:33,310
These 25 lakhs is also a gift.

1736
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:35,354
Good thing the parcel
went to the wrong address...

1737
01:36:35,489 --> 01:36:37,354
To Pepsi Ballad and
she reported it to us.

1738
01:36:37,491 --> 01:36:38,549
Listen. Where are you taking him...

1739
01:36:38,659 --> 01:36:40,126
Mummy you go inside...

1740
01:36:40,227 --> 01:36:42,092
I will come in sometime...
just inform Ashima

1741
01:36:50,538 --> 01:36:53,473
My beloved didn't show up

1742
01:36:53,574 --> 01:36:56,134
My beloved didn't show up

1743
01:36:56,544 --> 01:36:59,377
My beloved didn't show up

1744
01:36:59,513 --> 01:37:02,346
My beloved didn't show up

1745
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:05,081
I am sorry my dear.

1746
01:37:08,522 --> 01:37:11,355
My love didn't show up

1747
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:13,357
My beloved didn't show up

1748
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:20,058
When I saw your divine eyes

1749
01:37:20,534 --> 01:37:24,197
When I saw your divine eyes

1750
01:37:24,638 --> 01:37:26,037
Hey hero come outside.

1751
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:31,043
Now you tell me that when a person
gets such good news after years...

1752
01:37:31,245 --> 01:37:34,078
...who's become a
father for the first time...

1753
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:36,615
...and if he happens
to be a rich man...

1754
01:37:36,717 --> 01:37:38,241
Wouldn't he like to
share his happiness?

1755
01:37:38,352 --> 01:37:40,752
...he'd like to give a gift...
in cash or kind...

1756
01:37:41,222 --> 01:37:44,419
...besides this one came
from the minister's house...

1757
01:37:45,326 --> 01:37:47,624
...now if I take his name then
both of us will be in trouble...

1758
01:37:47,728 --> 01:37:49,161
Is there a business like this also?

1759
01:37:49,263 --> 01:37:52,357
Yes ofcourse sir, and
its legal. Sperm donation.

1760
01:37:52,466 --> 01:37:55,629
Dr. Chaddha now I don't want to have
anything to do with you seriously...

1761
01:37:55,836 --> 01:37:57,269
What happened.

1762
01:37:58,105 --> 01:37:59,766
It makes no difference to you...

1763
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:00,738
...if the some one's
life is destroyed does it.

1764
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:02,274
Just tell me what happened

1765
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:04,674
Sir Ashima can not be pregnant.

1766
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:07,373
We can not have a child.

1767
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:10,244
Me, a sperm donor,
used to brag about it...

1768
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:12,080
...and now I myself
can't have a child...

1769
01:38:14,388 --> 01:38:15,355
Oh no.

1770
01:38:15,456 --> 01:38:17,151
She has tubal blockage.

1771
01:38:19,193 --> 01:38:20,387
I am so sorry.

1772
01:38:20,694 --> 01:38:22,093
Forget this sorry sir...

1773
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:25,724
it's like this only now,
life has taken my case.

1774
01:38:26,267 --> 01:38:28,098
Just listen...

1775
01:38:36,877 --> 01:38:38,174
Where is Ashima?

1776
01:38:44,385 --> 01:38:47,218
Don't you feel ashamed of
yourself doing this dirty business?

1777
01:38:47,488 --> 01:38:51,117
The inspector suspected
me of running a brothel...

1778
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:55,351
You have ruined our family's name...

1779
01:38:57,665 --> 01:38:59,155
...and you ask me where Ashima is...

1780
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:02,360
She has left for Calcutta...

1781
01:39:02,469 --> 01:39:04,869
...and if I was in her place,
I would have done the same.

1782
01:39:06,707 --> 01:39:08,334
Now get lost from here.

1783
01:39:09,276 --> 01:39:14,646
The purity of water

1784
01:39:15,282 --> 01:39:20,743
The purity of water.

1785
01:39:21,388 --> 01:39:25,848
Tuna have you fought
with him and come here.

1786
01:39:26,193 --> 01:39:27,455
No dad.

1787
01:39:27,761 --> 01:39:29,251
Then what's wrong.

1788
01:39:30,264 --> 01:39:31,595
Nothing.

1789
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:37,732
Vicky you have really
insulted us and your Dr. Chaddha...

1790
01:39:37,972 --> 01:39:40,372
...bloody villain,
I'll catch him soon...

1791
01:39:40,474 --> 01:39:43,534
Sperm donor ohm...

1792
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:45,838
so what's the problem.

1793
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:47,403
What are you saying dad?

1794
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:49,204
How can you support him?

1795
01:39:49,316 --> 01:39:52,342
Darling you are a
modern woman, well read...

1796
01:39:52,453 --> 01:39:54,546
...well traveled and you are
talking like this rubbish.

1797
01:39:54,688 --> 01:39:57,521
Rubbish... your calling it rubbish...

1798
01:39:58,225 --> 01:39:59,749
Your son-in-law
already has children...

1799
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:01,623
...and you expect me to
have a modern outlook?

1800
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:03,960
He should have told me...

1801
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:08,929
So... what...

1802
01:40:09,303 --> 01:40:11,771
These are today's so
called modern women

1803
01:40:12,573 --> 01:40:15,770
...shameless - who can give
birth to a child with anybody...

1804
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:21,580
Grand mom you call yourself modern.
Are modern people like this.

1805
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:26,551
Atleast I understood one thing.
- Bread also got burnt.

1806
01:40:27,254 --> 01:40:30,917
Those who couldn't have kids,
have kids today because of Vicky

1807
01:40:31,992 --> 01:40:34,790
Mom it's all science.

1808
01:40:35,262 --> 01:40:38,698
Listen... to hell with
your science and arts...

1809
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:42,495
...because of this our
entire family's name is ruined...

1810
01:40:42,803 --> 01:40:44,327
This is science...

1811
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:48,935
Memories

1812
01:40:49,543 --> 01:40:52,410
Your memories

1813
01:40:53,013 --> 01:40:55,607
Your thoughts

1814
01:40:56,583 --> 01:41:00,451
Smolder my life

1815
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:03,322
Nights

1816
01:41:03,757 --> 01:41:06,726
Dark, Ionesome nights

1817
01:41:07,327 --> 01:41:14,756
Frighten me, hound me

1818
01:41:15,335 --> 01:41:17,963
My love,

1819
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:20,964
without you I shall die

1820
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:24,044
Dolly let it be, am
not in a good mood today

1821
01:41:24,311 --> 01:41:26,006
without you I shall die

1822
01:41:26,313 --> 01:41:28,042
Even I am not in the mood

1823
01:41:28,315 --> 01:41:29,509
Thank you.

1824
01:41:29,616 --> 01:41:31,641
Vicky how are you brother?

1825
01:41:31,785 --> 01:41:35,721
Are you happy now? - Brother
if your there won't I be happy?

1826
01:41:35,823 --> 01:41:36,949
Vicky dear you've come alone?

1827
01:41:37,057 --> 01:41:38,615
Dolly aunty and Ashima didn't come?

1828
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:42,923
No they didn't come.
- Congratulations.

1829
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:45,959
They haunt

1830
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,028
And tear me apart

1831
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:53,064
Your memories

1832
01:41:53,607 --> 01:41:57,543
Your thoughts

1833
01:41:57,945 --> 01:42:00,379
My love,

1834
01:42:01,014 --> 01:42:04,450
without you I shall die

1835
01:42:05,052 --> 01:42:06,417
My love,

1836
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:10,422
without you I shall die

1837
01:42:11,692 --> 01:42:15,059
Oye Vicky I heard
that Ashima has left...

1838
01:42:16,063 --> 01:42:17,860
listen am your uncle if you
have anything to say feel free.

1839
01:42:17,965 --> 01:42:19,626
You didn't even call...

1840
01:42:20,367 --> 01:42:21,766
where are you going.

1841
01:42:22,703 --> 01:42:25,467
To donate sperm. You
want to come along?

1842
01:42:25,839 --> 01:42:28,774
They haunt

1843
01:42:29,409 --> 01:42:31,900
And tear me apart

1844
01:42:32,112 --> 01:42:34,979
Vicky dear at my shop, look,
this is the ladies section...

1845
01:42:35,082 --> 01:42:36,379
...and that is gents section.

1846
01:42:36,483 --> 01:42:38,383
Poppy write the bills...
- Yes, father.

1847
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:44,355
Vicky Dolly had called me, told me
that you've done something wrong...

1848
01:42:44,424 --> 01:42:46,358
...really you've done
something very inappropriate...

1849
01:42:46,426 --> 01:42:48,087
What wrong... what wrong have I done.

1850
01:42:48,395 --> 01:42:50,955
Uncle I was a sperm donor.
Is sperm donation wrong work.

1851
01:42:51,431 --> 01:42:52,455
If it is yes then what you will do.

1852
01:42:52,566 --> 01:42:53,726
You will stop me
from coming in the shop.

1853
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:55,096
Go to hell with your shop.

1854
01:42:55,402 --> 01:42:58,462
What have you done all your whole
life except giving birth to this Poppy.

1855
01:42:58,572 --> 01:42:59,903
If you were a sperm donor like me...

1856
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:03,405
...then could have had a chance
of giving birth to better samples.

1857
01:43:03,477 --> 01:43:05,945
My love,

1858
01:43:06,647 --> 01:43:09,548
without you I shall die

1859
01:43:10,617 --> 01:43:11,879
My love,

1860
01:43:11,985 --> 01:43:15,477
without you I shall die

1861
01:43:17,724 --> 01:43:20,386
My love,

1862
01:43:20,794 --> 01:43:22,159
without you I shall die

1863
01:43:22,429 --> 01:43:26,525
Hello, you didn't call me even once

1864
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:30,602
Say something atleast

1865
01:43:31,705 --> 01:43:32,831
What.

1866
01:43:35,442 --> 01:43:36,773
Just ask me how I am

1867
01:43:42,516 --> 01:43:43,744
Come back my dear...

1868
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:48,480
...promise will
never make you cry again.

1869
01:43:48,956 --> 01:43:51,049
I need some more time Vicky.

1870
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:53,718
Memories

1871
01:43:54,228 --> 01:43:56,924
Your memories

1872
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:58,664
How are you.

1873
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:04,061
Let it be... how I
could be without you...

1874
01:44:05,839 --> 01:44:08,000
Nights

1875
01:44:08,609 --> 01:44:11,169
Dark, Ionesome nights

1876
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:19,508
Frighten me, hound me

1877
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:22,682
My love,

1878
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:25,581
without you I shall die

1879
01:44:25,692 --> 01:44:26,750
Hello Vicky

1880
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:28,987
How you dare to call here.

1881
01:44:29,196 --> 01:44:31,596
You got only my son in
the entire world for this.

1882
01:44:31,698 --> 01:44:33,928
No
- See I also know to do business...

1883
01:44:34,001 --> 01:44:35,901
...but I never play with
the emotions of people.

1884
01:44:36,003 --> 01:44:37,834
See you are misunderstanding me.

1885
01:44:37,971 --> 01:44:40,496
We have trusted on you
and you have used us.

1886
01:44:40,574 --> 01:44:43,702
You have made our house into pieces,
made partition of it.

1887
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:45,573
What type of doctor are you?

1888
01:44:46,179 --> 01:44:46,941
Let it be now.

1889
01:44:47,047 --> 01:44:50,642
Shut up and see I am
giving you warning that...

1890
01:44:50,751 --> 01:44:53,049
...if you came in front of my eyes...

1891
01:44:53,587 --> 01:44:57,114
...and if you tried to meet
or contact to me or Vicky...

1892
01:44:57,224 --> 01:45:00,057
...in future then I
will cut you into pieces.

1893
01:45:08,068 --> 01:45:10,593
Meet me once, please.

1894
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:13,766
Please Dr. Chaddha it's Ok

1895
01:45:15,042 --> 01:45:16,270
It makes no difference.

1896
01:45:16,543 --> 01:45:19,239
All these things happened and
you did not tell me anything.

1897
01:45:24,785 --> 01:45:28,585
Sir the reality is that you
have taken his advantage...

1898
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:32,887
...you have purchased car,
farm house and house.

1899
01:45:34,227 --> 01:45:37,890
First it is important to take
out Vicky from this situation...

1900
01:45:38,665 --> 01:45:43,602
...otherwise the acidity which
is in me will never be healed up.

1901
01:45:43,704 --> 01:45:47,071
Dolly is the first lady
who read me correctly.

1902
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:51,634
It is called grip on life...
that she has.

1903
01:45:52,846 --> 01:45:58,910
She was shouting in anger on phone
but there was pain in the voice.

1904
01:45:59,886 --> 01:46:00,716
Great lady.

1905
01:46:00,821 --> 01:46:03,051
Sir I understand Dolly ma'am...

1906
01:46:03,924 --> 01:46:06,859
...but now what to do
further that we have must think.

1907
01:46:09,296 --> 01:46:10,854
Oh, God.

1908
01:46:11,898 --> 01:46:15,026
So, what you are thinking sir.

1909
01:46:16,036 --> 01:46:19,199
I don't understand how
it will happen so soon.

1910
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:21,032
You don't give me tension.

1911
01:46:21,141 --> 01:46:24,133
Sir you don't take tension and go.

1912
01:46:24,711 --> 01:46:27,612
Just leave that key and lap top here.

1913
01:47:05,652 --> 01:47:08,052
Chaman!

1914
01:47:08,922 --> 01:47:12,153
Chaman what is going on.

1915
01:47:12,325 --> 01:47:13,656
Sir good morning sir

1916
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:14,988
Good morning.

1917
01:47:16,029 --> 01:47:17,690
Sir

1918
01:47:18,298 --> 01:47:19,629
What is this.

1919
01:47:19,733 --> 01:47:22,725
Sir this is the file of Vicky
Donor and all the details are in this.

1920
01:47:23,036 --> 01:47:25,334
Oh you are very unpredictable sperm.

1921
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,873
Sir you don't think now
and take the name of God...

1922
01:47:27,974 --> 01:47:29,805
...and dial the first number.

1923
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:31,775
You are right.

1924
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:37,713
Hello yes... Mr. Bhatia speaking?

1925
01:47:37,851 --> 01:47:42,288
Mr. Bhatia greetings, . Dr. Baldev
from Chaddha Infertility clinic...

1926
01:47:42,923 --> 01:47:48,657
O.K. Ma'am... Ahuja with Mrs.
Ahuja next Saturday 25th Anniversary.

1927
01:47:48,762 --> 01:47:50,389
Am I talking to Mrs. Grewal.

1928
01:47:50,697 --> 01:47:52,130
Hello, Dr. Chaddha.

1929
01:47:52,232 --> 01:47:54,996
Oh my God you recognized my voice.

1930
01:47:55,135 --> 01:47:59,765
You know what my in-laws say
that he is a ghost of Ambani.

1931
01:48:02,075 --> 01:48:06,102
Yes I have sent silver
anniversary card by courier.

1932
01:48:06,213 --> 01:48:08,875
But it was my duty to
invite you personally.

1933
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:10,745
Mrs. Mehta has done another one!

1934
01:48:10,851 --> 01:48:12,182
I am so sorry Mr. Mehta...

1935
01:48:12,285 --> 01:48:14,048
...by the way Mr. Mehta
can you give the number...

1936
01:48:14,187 --> 01:48:16,155
...of new husband of Mrs. Mehta.

1937
01:48:18,058 --> 01:48:19,047
He cut it

1938
01:48:19,192 --> 01:48:21,285
Can I talk to Mrs. Mirchandani please.

1939
01:48:21,394 --> 01:48:23,453
Next baby, cooler sperm...

1940
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:26,363
After two building.

1941
01:48:31,404 --> 01:48:33,463
Madam is not there... he is in
the bedroom with someone else.

1942
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:39,404
Yes Mr. Lee Silver Jubilee

1943
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:42,914
Kapoor or this is
just a gentle reminder.

1944
01:48:43,016 --> 01:48:44,210
We will definitely come.

1945
01:48:44,317 --> 01:48:46,080
Tuna so what's your plan.

1946
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:48,483
Bank wants to know
when you are joining back.

1947
01:48:48,755 --> 01:48:49,779
I don't know.

1948
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:52,290
What you are doing is
not good for you Tuna.

1949
01:48:52,392 --> 01:48:55,293
Whatever is in your heart you must
discuss with Vicky, it is necessary.

1950
01:48:55,462 --> 01:48:56,759
It is necessary.

1951
01:48:56,963 --> 01:48:59,056
Did he feel necessary to tell me?

1952
01:49:01,001 --> 01:49:02,366
I don't know

1953
01:49:03,803 --> 01:49:05,327
You are so shameless!

1954
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:07,866
Always keep coming here!

1955
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:09,770
Every one commits a mistake.

1956
01:49:10,110 --> 01:49:11,304
You forget the past.

1957
01:49:11,411 --> 01:49:13,777
Again you are back on the same topic.

1958
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:15,470
Don't say topic...

1959
01:49:15,882 --> 01:49:17,440
...since the last two months four...

1960
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:19,212
...cases have been
lodged by clients against me.

1961
01:49:19,419 --> 01:49:23,253
You ask why because their
children have not even learnt to say...

1962
01:49:23,356 --> 01:49:28,055
...mummy papa and they
have started to abuse.

1963
01:49:28,395 --> 01:49:32,456
The party says that the family
back ground of the donor was not good.

1964
01:49:34,968 --> 01:49:36,401
Shake hands at least!

1965
01:49:36,836 --> 01:49:39,361
Well tried Chaddha sir,
please get out.

1966
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:41,266
Please.

1967
01:49:43,076 --> 01:49:47,877
See I can understand your
frustration but I realized.

1968
01:49:47,981 --> 01:49:49,972
How can you
understand the frustration?

1969
01:49:51,084 --> 01:49:53,518
This house is not a
house without Ashima.

1970
01:49:54,521 --> 01:49:56,045
The silence is haunting...

1971
01:49:56,156 --> 01:50:01,822
One iron lady your
mother told me correctly...

1972
01:50:02,862 --> 01:50:05,353
...that I have
spoiled your family life.

1973
01:50:05,832 --> 01:50:08,494
I did it. I have to correct it now.

1974
01:50:09,336 --> 01:50:11,827
Dolly says that Ashima
should come back home.

1975
01:50:11,938 --> 01:50:14,133
I also think that
Ashima should come back.

1976
01:50:14,274 --> 01:50:17,141
Ashima has to understand
that you were not wrong.

1977
01:50:17,277 --> 01:50:18,801
This is not possible.

1978
01:50:18,878 --> 01:50:23,975
Once you bring her to my clinic
for one hour on next Saturday.

1979
01:50:24,084 --> 01:50:27,144
Next Saturday is the 25th
anniversary of the clinic.

1980
01:50:27,287 --> 01:50:30,415
See this, 25th silver
jubilee anniversary.

1981
01:50:34,427 --> 01:50:36,088
Do you think that she will come?

1982
01:50:36,563 --> 01:50:37,587
Brother...

1983
01:50:37,864 --> 01:50:41,163
I told you I need some more time.

1984
01:50:42,502 --> 01:50:44,094
I can not come now.

1985
01:50:44,871 --> 01:50:49,831
Just see, it is only
a matter of one day.

1986
01:50:50,577 --> 01:50:54,877
Even after that if you feel
that what I did was wrong then...

1987
01:50:56,216 --> 01:50:58,013
...we will sort out according to you.

1988
01:50:59,152 --> 01:51:03,088
You want separation or divorce?

1989
01:51:03,189 --> 01:51:04,349
Divorce?

1990
01:51:05,592 --> 01:51:11,531
Did I hear divorce... no no.
Not again you will go with him.

1991
01:51:11,631 --> 01:51:13,496
Dad you are again taking his side.

1992
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,329
Yes I am...

1993
01:51:16,603 --> 01:51:19,003
...because you are only
thinking about yourself.

1994
01:51:19,105 --> 01:51:22,438
But she is right papa, meaning I
have not told her. It is my mistake.

1995
01:51:22,542 --> 01:51:24,100
Question yourself Tuna.

1996
01:51:24,611 --> 01:51:29,947
You are hurt because he was donor
or he has not informed you or...

1997
01:51:31,117 --> 01:51:34,018
...you can not get pregnant
while he can become a father.

1998
01:51:39,926 --> 01:51:41,416
He loves you...

1999
01:51:43,163 --> 01:51:46,929
...even after knowing that because of
you he can not give birth to a child.

2000
01:51:48,535 --> 01:51:53,131
He loves you... he wants to be with
you... it's not that easy darling.

2001
01:51:53,406 --> 01:51:57,001
For once, just think from his side.

2002
01:51:57,544 --> 01:51:59,102
It's ok.

2003
01:52:01,214 --> 01:52:04,445
If you don't want to
come then don't come.

2004
01:52:05,285 --> 01:52:06,650
Why are you crying?

2005
01:52:08,154 --> 01:52:11,351
See I have come to your city
Kolkata for the second time.

2006
01:52:13,326 --> 01:52:15,021
Show me your city.

2007
01:52:17,097 --> 01:52:18,587
Show me Kaalibadi...

2008
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:23,167
...a match of Mohan Bagan...

2009
01:52:25,705 --> 01:52:27,468
Make me meet Mamata didi

2010
01:52:33,213 --> 01:52:34,942
But don't cry.

2011
01:52:56,002 --> 01:52:57,401
Welcome.

2012
01:52:58,671 --> 01:53:00,332
Come, come.

2013
01:53:02,008 --> 01:53:05,705
Grace of God,
welcome... come... please come.

2014
01:53:06,746 --> 01:53:08,407
Ashima.

2015
01:53:13,553 --> 01:53:21,255
Whatever Vicky has done or I got it
done from him was right or wrong...

2016
01:53:21,361 --> 01:53:23,329
I really don't know...

2017
01:53:24,364 --> 01:53:29,063
Call me a businessman or a
doctor or my helplessness...

2018
01:53:29,202 --> 01:53:33,571
Nor do I wish to
give any explanation...

2019
01:53:34,274 --> 01:53:37,334
But I would like to
ask you one question.

2020
01:53:38,178 --> 01:53:43,707
Just stand here and tell me
how you are feeling to see...

2021
01:53:45,051 --> 01:53:46,712
...these kids playing in the park.

2022
01:53:47,754 --> 01:53:51,713
What kind of a question is this?
All I know is among these...

2023
01:53:52,659 --> 01:53:55,355
...kids even my child
could have been there.

2024
01:53:57,163 --> 01:54:01,156
All are happy, enjoying.

2025
01:54:01,701 --> 01:54:04,033
Everyone's family is complete but...

2026
01:54:05,371 --> 01:54:06,565
...why not mine.

2027
01:54:07,073 --> 01:54:11,567
Just like you are feeling now...

2028
01:54:11,678 --> 01:54:16,342
...few years back parents of these
children were also feeling the same.

2029
01:54:17,083 --> 01:54:20,280
Before Vicky donor
came into their life.

2030
01:54:20,787 --> 01:54:25,224
The reason for their
happiness is Vicky.

2031
01:54:26,192 --> 01:54:30,253
Because these
children are from his sperm.

2032
01:54:35,401 --> 01:54:36,390
Come with me.

2033
01:54:36,536 --> 01:54:38,299
Look, look.

2034
01:54:50,884 --> 01:54:54,445
Which among them are mine?

2035
01:54:55,622 --> 01:54:58,420
Each & everyone is yours...

2036
01:55:00,293 --> 01:55:02,523
All of them are mine?
- 53

2037
01:55:02,896 --> 01:55:04,158
53.

2038
01:55:04,464 --> 01:55:06,523
Total 53

2039
01:55:08,635 --> 01:55:10,159
Vicky...

2040
01:55:13,172 --> 01:55:14,696
Can I meet them?
- Sure.

2041
01:55:14,874 --> 01:55:17,741
Yes but don't ask for details.

2042
01:55:27,186 --> 01:55:34,149
When this little flower
bud blooms into a plant

2043
01:55:34,928 --> 01:55:39,126
Bud blooms into a plant

2044
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:47,770
The pot of wants blooms with it

2045
01:55:48,641 --> 01:55:50,905
The pot of wants blooms with it

2046
01:55:51,177 --> 01:55:54,374
And so does the demand for this...

2047
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:57,779
...that and just about
everything that money can buy

2048
01:55:57,884 --> 01:56:04,790
As the wants are unlimited
and even bigger than the sky

2049
01:56:07,627 --> 01:56:09,822
Hello.

2050
01:56:09,896 --> 01:56:12,194
Its so magical.

2051
01:56:12,298 --> 01:56:14,630
Here, here's you gift.

2052
01:56:15,201 --> 01:56:17,635
There he stands, and
another one stands

2053
01:56:17,870 --> 01:56:21,328
Asking for money, and much more money

2054
01:56:21,908 --> 01:56:27,778
When this little plant
turns into a big tree

2055
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:28,744
Very good.

2056
01:56:28,848 --> 01:56:29,815
Enjoy yourself.

2057
01:56:29,916 --> 01:56:32,612
When a bud turns into a tree

2058
01:56:35,254 --> 01:56:36,186
He is quiet fit.

2059
01:56:36,255 --> 01:56:42,353
You get the urge to live

2060
01:56:42,462 --> 01:56:44,259
You get the urge to live

2061
01:56:44,731 --> 01:56:45,789
Sit down, sit down.

2062
01:56:45,898 --> 01:56:49,299
Mix this and mix that...

2063
01:56:49,402 --> 01:56:52,530
It's the colour of life...

2064
01:56:52,839 --> 01:56:59,403
Whatever you mix, it will be less...
the need is as much as the sky...

2065
01:57:00,346 --> 01:57:01,870
Its a great couple

2066
01:57:05,351 --> 01:57:08,320
That boy there in black...

2067
01:57:11,290 --> 01:57:13,224
...his hair is like yours...

2068
01:57:15,461 --> 01:57:17,588
That little foreigner girl's...

2069
01:57:19,766 --> 01:57:21,757
...nose is like yours...

2070
01:57:24,804 --> 01:57:27,534
...that little ching chong...

2071
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:31,840
...his eyes are like yours.

2072
01:57:33,613 --> 01:57:37,743
Baba was right and I was insecure.

2073
01:57:39,285 --> 01:57:45,781
I can not do the same
which you did... never...

2074
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:48,891
I am sorry.

2075
01:57:49,295 --> 01:57:50,853
I am sorry.

2076
01:57:53,332 --> 01:57:54,560
I am sorry.

2077
01:58:18,524 --> 01:58:20,287
There is one more child...

2078
01:58:22,428 --> 01:58:24,658
...and I want you to meet with him.

2079
01:58:27,633 --> 01:58:30,659
Myself and Chaman were inviting the...

2080
01:58:30,803 --> 01:58:32,737
...clients by going door
to door for the anniversary.

2081
01:58:32,839 --> 01:58:35,433
I came to know that
one couple among them...

2082
01:58:35,641 --> 01:58:39,304
...died in a car accident
near Chandigarh few years back.

2083
01:58:39,445 --> 01:58:41,845
After death of the son
they came to know...

2084
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:44,350
...that their grand
daughter is a donor baby.

2085
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:48,047
They tried hard to find
out but could not succeed.

2086
01:58:48,354 --> 01:58:51,016
Due to the old age and since there
was no one after them to take care...

2087
01:58:51,124 --> 01:58:54,457
...they put her in
this orphanage house.

2088
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:57,757
Thank you Dr. Chaddha for
doing this, you saved a soul...

2089
01:58:58,364 --> 01:59:01,765
...and Mr. And Mrs. Arora the
name of the child is Diya...

2090
01:59:01,934 --> 01:59:04,528
...and she's been here
with us for last six months...

2091
01:59:05,037 --> 01:59:06,095
Shall we go and meet her.

2092
01:59:06,372 --> 01:59:07,566
Sure sure...

2093
01:59:53,853 --> 01:59:55,377
Let's go home.

2094
02:00:04,897 --> 02:00:05,829
Thank you ma'am

2095
02:00:06,165 --> 02:00:08,497
I am sure you are
going to keep Diya happy.

2096
02:00:08,601 --> 02:00:09,863
Thanks ma'am

2097
02:00:10,670 --> 02:00:12,035
Thank you very much. Thank you.

2098
02:00:12,138 --> 02:00:14,504
Thanks.
- Come. Come.

2099
02:00:20,213 --> 02:00:21,578
Thank you.

2100
02:00:21,781 --> 02:00:23,009
God bless.

2101
02:00:32,825 --> 02:00:36,192
You did all this for me.

2102
02:00:37,663 --> 02:00:39,426
Chaddha sir you are unbelievable...

2103
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:43,566
What did I do? I
have not done anything.

2104
02:00:45,671 --> 02:00:48,003
You did all this and
this is your wonder.

2105
02:00:49,542 --> 02:00:52,136
The wonder of your sperm

2106
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:56,675
This entire world is a sperm.

2107
02:01:02,255 --> 02:01:03,654
God bless you.

2108
02:01:04,824 --> 02:01:06,519
Bye.

2109
02:01:31,517 --> 02:01:32,484
Chaddha sir...

2110
02:01:32,551 --> 02:01:35,714
Listen there is a
demand from one more party.

2111
02:01:35,821 --> 02:01:38,187
What are you talking?
I am a family man now.

2112
02:01:38,524 --> 02:01:40,116
Just do it for the last time.

2113
02:01:40,526 --> 02:01:41,652
Shall I say yes?

2114
02:01:41,761 --> 02:01:44,229
I will get it picked up
from any where you say.

2115
02:01:46,065 --> 02:01:47,089
Ok.

2116
02:01:47,199 --> 02:01:49,167
Ok. Bye!!!

2117
02:02:06,752 --> 02:02:10,188
"The one with beautiful eyes,
open the window and see."

2118
02:02:10,289 --> 02:02:13,781
"Weigh it in your heart and see."

2119
02:02:16,996 --> 02:02:20,727
"The one with beautiful eyes,
open the window and see."

2120
02:02:20,833 --> 02:02:23,961
"Weigh it in your heart and see."

2121
02:02:24,070 --> 02:02:28,666
"You will not find a
young man like me."

2122
02:02:29,141 --> 02:02:34,135
"You may search in the whole world."

2123
02:02:34,246 --> 02:02:37,682
"Search, search. Search, search."

2124
02:02:37,783 --> 02:02:40,911
"You people go for the door.
I want to be on the floor."

2125
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:44,556
"Mix it with our colours."

2126
02:02:44,657 --> 02:02:47,922
"Go over it with red flowers."

2127
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:52,793
"You will not find a
young man like me."

2128
02:02:53,165 --> 02:02:58,193
"You may search in the whole world."

2129
02:02:58,304 --> 02:03:01,671
"Search, search. Search, search."

2130
02:03:01,774 --> 02:03:04,675
"You people go for the door.
I want to be on the floor."

2131
02:03:04,744 --> 02:03:08,612
"You people go for the door.
I want to be on the floor."

2132
02:03:22,228 --> 02:03:25,686
"For the sake of love."

2133
02:03:25,798 --> 02:03:29,700
"Will open my heart before you."

2134
02:03:32,671 --> 02:03:37,233
"You will not find a
young man like me."

2135
02:03:37,777 --> 02:03:42,874
"You may search in the whole world."

2136
02:03:42,948 --> 02:03:46,679
"Search, search. Search, search."

2137
02:03:56,395 --> 02:04:00,092
"My shoes are sequenced."

2138
02:04:00,199 --> 02:04:03,293
"The moustache is starched,
and the turban is colourful."

2139
02:04:03,402 --> 02:04:07,998
"You will not find a
young man like me."

2140
02:04:08,674 --> 02:04:13,702
"You may search in the whole world."

2141
02:04:13,946 --> 02:04:17,177
"Search, search. Search, search."
