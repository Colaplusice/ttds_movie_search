That one over there.

00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,828
The blue one.

33
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:51,898
I can get it farther
than you, Moonee.

34
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:53,565
Yeah, right.

35
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:01,502
I got two points ahead
of you, Moonee.

36
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:04,017
- I got 100 points ahead of you.
- Now, I got 100 points.

37
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:05,184
That's not possible.

38
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,160
Is that you?

39
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:13,502
I'm gonna get...
I'm gonna get the front.

40
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:17,306
Oh!

41
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,659
I got the windshield.

42
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:20,019
I got the top.

43
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:24,160
What the fuck is-- Wha-?

00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:25,957

Come on, are you

- Bitch! Fuck it!

53
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:45,654
Get your fuckin' ass down here
right now and clean it up.

54
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:47,600
Clean this shit up right now!

55
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,365
You're not the boss of me!

56
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,334
Where are your parents at?

57
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:52,334
Hey, hey!

58
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:55,803
He spit on me.

59
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:58,975
It wasn't him, it was
me, stupid thot!

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,506
I'm gonna go up there
and tell your parents.

61
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:03,430
Try it, bee-otch! I don't live here!

00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:04,680

00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:08,430
Hey!

66
00:04:11,227 --> 00:04:11,992
Stay right there.

67
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:12,910
Hey!

68
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:13,957
Go, go, go, go.

69
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:15,754

00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:17,793
Hey! Get over here!

00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,284
Dicky!

73
00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:25,115
Get your ass upstairs right now.

74
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,042
- Dad?
- Now!

75
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:29,708
Hey, is that your kid?

76
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:31,864
Him and his friends
just spit on my car.

77
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:32,636
Get over here.

78
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:34,411
Why you stop me in
front of my friends?

79
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:39,815
- Whoa.
- Whoo.

80
00:04:41,263 --> 00:04:43,083
Put her up, put her up.

81
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:46,748
Yeah.

82
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:47,630
Mm.

83
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:48,544
Yeah.

84
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:49,396
Mm.

85
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:49,958
Yeah.

86
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:50,981
Ppp-pkkw-pkkw

87
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:53,997
Mm, yeah, Mm, yeah.

88
00:05:05,884 --> 00:05:06,876
Thanks.

89
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,900
'Cause I can't my boo boo boo...

90
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:20,432
Hey, hey, hey.

91
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,791
Take your shoes off.

92
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:22,885
Both of you.

93
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,979
Hey, where's the Slinky?

94
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:27,215
Here, I'll find-- like this--

95
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:30,293
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

96
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,260
I wanna speak to the
manager right now.

97
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:33,465
Can I help you with somethin'?

98
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:34,472
Are you the manager?

99
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,877
- Yeah?
- Coming.

100
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:41,001
<i>Which one is the half off price?</i>

101
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:43,181
<i>$180 for the waffle maker?</i>

102
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:46,033
- Yeah?
- Gotta talk to your mom.

103
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:50,224
- Moonee, who was that?
- Nobody.

104
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:56,864
- Shit, Moonee, what did you two do?
- Nothing.

105
00:05:58,888 --> 00:05:59,693
Yeah?

106
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:01,849
Halley, this woman's
from next door

107
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,443
and she said Moonee
did something to her car.

108
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:06,138
You in 322?

109
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,443
No, FutureLand.

110
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:08,247
Oh.

111
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:12,288
Okay, her and her friend Scoot
spit all over my kid and my car.

112
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:15,468
- It's Scooty.
- It's Scooty, not Scoot.

113
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:18,539
- You saw them do this?
- Yes, I did!

114
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,352
And their friend's father told me that
they're always pulling this shit.

115
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,463
That's not true!

116
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:25,196
- Which friend?
- Whatever, they spit on my car,

117
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:27,338
- and they spit on my kid!
- O-okay, okay.

118
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:28,127
Okay.

119
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:31,221
Halley, one, sort this out.

120
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,619
Two, you smoke in the room
again, you're outta here.

121
00:06:34,713 --> 00:06:36,541
- I'm not smoking.
- Bye, Bobby!

122
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:39,299
- Last warning, Halley.
- Yeah? Well, I'm not!

123
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,152
Asshole.

124
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:44,192
Come on, you two,
go get some paper towels.

125
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:46,426
Whoa.

126
00:06:46,762 --> 00:06:47,793
Bertha!

127
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:49,624
We need paper towels!

128
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:51,718
We need paper towels!

129
00:06:52,427 --> 00:06:54,396
Papel de toilet, eh, eh?

130
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:58,156
- Que?
- Papel de toilet, eh, eh?

131
00:06:58,374 --> 00:06:59,203
Si.

132
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:03,854
Por favor.

133
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:14,256
- These two yours?
- These? No, they're not mine.

134
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:16,967
Well, they're mine now.

135
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:20,823
My daughter made me a
grandmother when she was 15.

136
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:23,416
So I'm just taking care of them

137
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:25,987
till she stops acting
like her stupid father.

138
00:07:29,337 --> 00:07:30,891
What time did you
move in, Gramma?

139
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:37,139
Oh, my God.

140
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:40,593
You got another one of those?

141
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,595
Hey, girl!

142
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:53,681
Hey!

143
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:56,024
- You won another one?
- Yeah.

144
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:57,423
When was this?

145
00:07:58,235 --> 00:07:59,009
Stop!

146
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:01,055
Hey, hey, guys, you're
having too much fun

147
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,910
and it's not supposed to be fun,
it's supposed to be work, okay?

148
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,909
- So, get on it.
- It's summer,

149
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:06,026
- Get on it.
- We got it, lady.

150
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:07,518
- Don't worry.
- Let them have a good time.

151
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:10,420
- I think it was very disrespectful.
- It's summer, what do you want?

152
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:12,006
Very disrespectful.

153
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:13,561
This is not okay.

154
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:14,777
Clearly we have
different versions...

155
00:08:14,802 --> 00:08:15,701
What's your name?

156
00:08:15,726 --> 00:08:16,513
Jancey.

157
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,490
Jancey? What kinda
name is Jancey?

158
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,537
Hey, Jancey.

159
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:25,805
It'd be a whole lot easier
if someone were to help us.

160
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:28,422
- They're doing you a favor.
- I am ashamed for you right now.

161
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:29,734
Are you serious?

162
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,098
Doing me a favor.

163
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:33,606
It didn't need that
kind of car wash.

164
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:36,754
Hey, hey, Jancey, honey,
what are you doing?

165
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:38,371
I'm cleaning up!

166
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,373
Yeah!

167
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:41,630
Jance, let them clean it
up by themselves, okay?

168
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:42,872
- That's not your job.
- No.

169
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,357
They askin' me to,
so I'm gonna do it.

170
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,904
No, I don't want you
doing that, okay?

171
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:48,022
Let her help.

172
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,195
- They're making friends.
- We should clean the inside too.

173
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,101
It's a mess.

174
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:52,250
You think they're
gonna get along

175
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:55,157
if they're not gonna like, socialize?
That's what they do here.

176
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:56,619
Yeah, social kids like you.

177
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:58,861
Yup, like me.
What are you tryna say, lady?

178
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:01,291
I'll spike you up
'cause you seem stressed.

179
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,728
I will help you out.

180
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,658
Maybe that's what I need.

181
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:08,638
I need to lighten up, I need to
light up, and I need to get laid.

182
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:12,092
Same here, girl, I-I feel you.

183
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:15,525
My turn.

184
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:18,099
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

185
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:54,293
Yo.

186
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,114
Ha!

187
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:11,503
Hey, baby.

188
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,675
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Miss Ashley.

189
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:14,839
Here you go.

190
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:16,105
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

191
00:10:16,443 --> 00:10:17,701
Hey, yo.

192
00:10:17,748 --> 00:10:20,779
My mom wants to know if you
want to go to OBT tonight.

193
00:10:20,897 --> 00:10:21,904
It's Saturday, right?

194
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:24,022
- Yeah.
- Okay then, we're gonna go.

195
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,133
Bye, you guys.

196
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:26,711
- Bye.
- Go have fun. Be careful, okay?

197
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:28,196
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye.

198
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:30,953
No maple syrup.

199
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:33,753
She didn't pack any for you?

200
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:34,628
No.

201
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:38,596
My mom makes mistakes
all the time.

202
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,373
Well, you need to let her know
we like extra maple syrup.

203
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:43,737
I always tell her and
then she forgets.

204
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:56,468
Take our picture!

205
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:06,065
Hey.

206
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,612
Hey guys.

207
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:10,354
Hey, girl, girl!
Thank you so much.

208
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,253
No problem.
Of course, of course.

209
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:14,122
- Let me know if they misbehave.
- Of course.

210
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,687
Guys, behave okay? Seriously.

211
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:19,389
How you been?
You've been good?

212
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:20,906
I've been good. Working.

213
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:22,615
You know, taking
care of the baby.

214
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,570
You already know.
Hi, babe.

215
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,867
- Hi.
- So good to see--

216
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:28,452
Yeah!

217
00:11:32,302 --> 00:11:34,084
- Hey!
- Hola, chica.

218
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:37,959
Uno de chica en mi pollo

219
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:49,898
They fuckin' chose Simone.

220
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:52,202
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

221
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:55,459
I know, right? I've been there
way longer than that bitch.

222
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:56,873
I can't even believe it.

223
00:11:58,275 --> 00:11:59,384
Fuck that.

224
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:01,548
The second that I'm a manager...

225
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:04,080
you're totally hired, ma, I got you.

226
00:12:05,462 --> 00:12:06,814
Don't be tight.

227
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,016
Let's-let's just
have a good night.

228
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:09,130
We'll have a good night.

229
00:12:11,326 --> 00:12:12,381
Smile!

230
00:12:13,373 --> 00:12:16,537
Most of those rachet-ass bitches
were doing extras, you know?

231
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:17,859
In the back room?

232
00:12:18,118 --> 00:12:19,727
I'm not doing that shit.

233
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:21,892
I'm dancing for tips,
that's what I do.

234
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:23,126
I said no.

235
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:26,217
Two days later, with no warning,
Hector fires me.

236
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:28,959
After not letting me up on stage
all fucking night?

237
00:12:29,061 --> 00:12:31,013
- Fucking bullshit.
- Halley, I'm sorry, but...

238
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:33,823
Okay, I'm-I'm sorry to say,
that's gonna affect your TANF.

239
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:35,772
No shit, that's why I'm here.

240
00:12:35,883 --> 00:12:36,816
Okay, Halley,

241
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:39,056
please make a concerted
effort to find thirty hours.

242
00:12:39,095 --> 00:12:39,843
Ha!

243
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:41,727
You find me thirty hours.

244
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:44,916
I have applications in at every
shithole up and down the strip

245
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:46,672
and the parks ain't gonna hire me.

246
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:49,204
Okay, so can you please control
your language in front of her?

247
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:50,213
And everyone else in here?

248
00:12:50,238 --> 00:12:51,861
Can you just give
me some bus passes?

249
00:12:51,886 --> 00:12:53,042
Why did I even come out here?

250
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:54,745
Halley, please, I'm trying to--

251
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:10,874
Hi!

252
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:13,132
Could Dicky come out and play?

253
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:16,165
After what you guys pulled?
He's punished for a week.

254
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:22,227
- Where we going?
- Just come on.

255
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:31,347
Lady, open it.

256
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:33,347
Hello there.

257
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:35,994
- What?
- Could Jancey come out and play?

258
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:38,745
What you're gonna take her
to spit on somebody else's car?

259
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:42,222
- No, we're just playing.
- Yeah, just playing.

260
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:45,814
- What are you playing?
- We're just playing!

261
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:48,198
Okay, what are you playing?
You didn't answer my question.

262
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:49,380
What are you playing?

263
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:53,217
Relax, your daughter's
safe in my hands.

264
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:54,920
And my hands too.

265
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:56,202
Yeah.

266
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:57,912
Jance?

267
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,471
Do you wanna go play with
the kids from the purple place?

268
00:14:03,117 --> 00:14:04,273
I want to play.

269
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:06,304
I wanna play too.

270
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:23,996
Hey, guys, don't you
live over here?

271
00:14:24,653 --> 00:14:27,309
Yeah, but we have more
things to show you.

272
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,277
Come on.

273
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,350
I-I don't-
I don't love oranges, I...

274
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,232
I don't love oranges.

275
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:38,154
I-I love orange soda.

276
00:14:39,232 --> 00:14:40,771
You squish--

277
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:43,086
I squish.

278
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:47,172
But the only thing I don't
like about oranges...

279
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:48,759
is the lid.

280
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:50,236
You mean the peel?

281
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:51,298
The lid.

282
00:14:51,362 --> 00:14:53,290
Yeah, that's called the peel.

283
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,697
Don't you think we're
going too far?

284
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:02,205
No. Just come on.
Don't be a--

285
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,830
Don't be a loser.

286
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:07,221
Don't call me that, but okay!

287
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:12,895
And this is where we
get free ice cream.

288
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,941
Really?

289
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:15,637
- Yeah.
- Yeah, follow me.

290
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:18,906
- Could we have some money?
- Change?

291
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:20,899
Do we have enough?

292
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:22,445
I'm counting.

293
00:15:28,742 --> 00:15:29,781
Let's go.

294
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:34,773
- Excuse me.
- Me.

295
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,531
Excuse me, Miss.

296
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:38,365
Could you give us
some change, please?

297
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,789
- We need to buy ice cream.
- Yes.

298
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:42,842
'Cause we don't have any money,
we just have five cents.

299
00:15:42,991 --> 00:15:44,678
Yeah, we just have five cents.

300
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:46,584
And the doctor say
we have asthma

301
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:48,662
and we gotta eat
ice cream right away.

302
00:15:48,795 --> 00:15:50,834
- Yeah, my doctor too.
- Sugar ice cream?

303
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,038
- Guys...
- We're not lying.

304
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,209
It's fine.

305
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:55,569
Thank you very much!

306
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:56,506
Here you go.

307
00:15:56,741 --> 00:15:57,686
Let's go!

308
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:58,623
Come on!

309
00:15:59,209 --> 00:15:59,998
Whoo!

310
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:01,773
Excuse me, excuse me.

311
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:02,530
Hello?

312
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:05,361
Oh!

313
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:07,009
Oooh!

314
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,041
Get that thing, girl.

315
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:15,713
- I feel like I'm gonna...
Okay, you wanna see the boss?

316
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,284
Hey!

317
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,743
My turn.

318
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,953
And, uh, cousin, I'm going to
give the last bite to you.

319
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,211
- Oh!
- Hunh!

320
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:34,804
The man who lives up here
fought in some wars.

321
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,328
And he drinks beer.

322
00:16:36,508 --> 00:16:39,867
This guys has disease
that make his feet large.

323
00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:43,953
Oh, and no one uses the elevator
'cause it smells like pee!

324
00:16:44,027 --> 00:16:46,683
The man who lives in here
gets arrested a lot.

325
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:50,853
This-this woman in here
thinks she's married to Jesus.

326
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:53,345
Oh, watch out,
watch out for the water.

327
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:56,158
'Cause guess what?
I went to the hospital one time.

328
00:16:56,678 --> 00:16:59,217
These are the rooms
we're not supposed to go in.

329
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:01,647
But let's go anyway!

330
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:04,327
<i>For just $19.99!</i>

331
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:07,850
<i>Just think, all that extra
practice every time you--</i>

332
00:17:09,124 --> 00:17:10,178
Oh, fuck!

333
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,649
Bobby!

334
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:28,217
What's going on?
Where's the power?

335
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,725
Bobby, listen, what's going on?

336
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,199
- Turn the power on!
- Hey, what the fuck man?

337
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:35,138
I pay my rent, $1,000 a month!

338
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:38,983
Okay! I'm on it!
Folks, come on!

339
00:17:39,243 --> 00:17:40,961
Come on! Give me a minute!

340
00:17:41,115 --> 00:17:42,170
It's gonna be all right!

341
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:43,599
Bobby, it's the hottest day!

342
00:17:43,624 --> 00:17:46,022
I'm gonna get your power
back, I know, I know!

343
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:48,264
Can't rush any faster
than I'm goin'!

344
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,114
- What's wrong?
- What did Bobby do now?

345
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:08,355
Drama's over, folks!

346
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,831
Ya got your power back!

347
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:11,034
Thank you, Bobby!

348
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:15,644
Can use your TVs, VCRs, AC,
what have ya!

349
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,786
Have a nice day!

350
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:19,723
Love you, Bobby!

351
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:22,028
I love you too!

352
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,366
Try payin' the bills, Bobby!

353
00:18:26,762 --> 00:18:28,355
You're dirt too, brother!

354
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:34,000
Crock pots, hot plates,

355
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:35,430
- These rooms are not designed
- And I... I...

356
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:37,400
for extended stay, Gloria.
You know that.

357
00:18:38,228 --> 00:18:39,430
Yeah, but I pay a lot of--

358
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:41,635
Electric was down for
five minutes, that's it.

359
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:43,509
Yeah, I-I want a discount
for this week.

360
00:18:43,564 --> 00:18:44,493
Why don't you just check out

361
00:18:44,518 --> 00:18:46,158
and go down to the
fucking Wishing Star?

362
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:51,738
Mmm...

363
00:18:54,523 --> 00:18:56,483
Mm-hmm...

364
00:18:58,043 --> 00:19:00,106
I like Wendy. She's nice.

365
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,153
Well, he's not nice to me!

366
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:05,583
Look.

367
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:06,661
Ugh!

368
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:07,747
Daddy, I'm...

369
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,732
<i>The catch container even
doubles as a measuring cup.</i>

370
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:13,646
<i>The one amazing tool
you wanna use over...</i>

371
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:15,287
<i>and over, and over...</i>

372
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:16,745
Moonee, you're not
gonna get that?

373
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:19,867
Yeah?

374
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,461
Halley, open the door!

375
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:23,805
Fucking-a! What d'you do now?

376
00:19:25,148 --> 00:19:26,391
Open the door, Halley.

377
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:29,234
Yeah?

378
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,218
I got a videotape

379
00:19:31,243 --> 00:19:34,486
of the kids illegally
entering the utility room

380
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:36,610
- and pulling the power.
- Don't act guilty, okay?

381
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:38,266
Hey, Scooty...

382
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:41,160
Did you hear what I
just said to her?

383
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,126
I got it. I'ma talk to her.

384
00:19:43,423 --> 00:19:45,431
Happens again,
you're outta here.

385
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,837
It's only second
week of the summer

386
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:50,665
and there's already been a-a
dead fish in the pool.

387
00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:52,165
We were doing an experiment.

388
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,518
We were trying to
get back alive.

389
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:55,540
That wasn't my idea.

390
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:57,454
And water balloons
thrown at tourists?

391
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:58,868
Ya can't fuck with tourists.

392
00:19:58,893 --> 00:19:59,971
They didn't tip us!

393
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:01,003
Are you serious?

394
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:03,567
Oh, my God,
this is unacceptable.

395
00:20:03,697 --> 00:20:05,541
I've failed as a mother, Moonee.

396
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:07,523
You've disgrace me.

397
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:09,732
- Halley...
- Yeah, Mom, you're disgraced.

398
00:20:09,802 --> 00:20:12,474
And I'm gonna talk to
Ashley, by the way.

399
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,342
When your friend
puts you in charge of her kid,

400
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:19,633
that kid becomes
your responsibility.

401
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:21,586
You ain't takin' responsibility.

402
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:23,889
And you got that one too.
She's from FutureLand, right?

403
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:26,485
Oh, well, I's...
you gotta relax, my man.

404
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,102
You gonna redo my expense reports
with your whatevs?

405
00:20:29,213 --> 00:20:31,947
Your kid killed my night.
I wanted to watch the ballgame.

406
00:20:31,972 --> 00:20:34,518
You gonna pay me for the three
hours that I gotta work later?

407
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:37,914
Hey, guys, pay the man
for his three hours.

408
00:20:38,032 --> 00:20:40,392
- I don't have any money.
- I don't have any money.

409
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:41,938
We don't have any money.

410
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:44,321
- You're shit outta luck.
- Speaking of which...

411
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:46,677
You haven't given me
this week's rent yet.

412
00:20:47,076 --> 00:20:48,740
You don't think I know that?
Chill.

413
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:01,880
Thank you.

414
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,161
You done here?

415
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:05,684
Yeah.

416
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,505
Thank you.

417
00:21:07,741 --> 00:21:08,788
Watch those kids.

418
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:12,210
I think I wanna go home now.

419
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:19,444
Wait, uh, hold on, I, uh...

420
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,467
Sir, I think we're
at the wrong place?

421
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,256
That's the address you gave me.

422
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,014
No, I-I-I, there's a-
there's a problem, uh, this is

423
00:21:29,106 --> 00:21:30,373
not where we're staying.

424
00:21:30,404 --> 00:21:31,983
Well, you wanna
check the address?

425
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:54,869
What's going on?

426
00:21:55,158 --> 00:21:56,385
How can I help?

427
00:21:56,526 --> 00:21:58,869
They-they made the
reservation online...

428
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:01,580
La la la la la

429
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:03,096
La la la la la

430
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:03,666
Hey.

431
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,205
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

432
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,124
Hey, what's up, man?

433
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:14,715
Yeah.

434
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:17,676
Oooh, nice bags.

435
00:22:19,575 --> 00:22:21,567
Are those guys tourists?

436
00:22:21,948 --> 00:22:23,643
I'm-a have to charge
you wait time.

437
00:22:23,815 --> 00:22:25,151
I'm missing calls.

438
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,799
Wait, wait, wait, uh,
I'll get the new address.

439
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:30,784
Just one second.

440
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:32,299
Listen, just call the
company, all right?

441
00:22:38,764 --> 00:22:39,873
She looks pretty.

442
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,818
Yeah.

443
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:44,037
But I feel bad for her,
she's about to cry.

444
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,928
I can always tell when a
girl's are about to cry.

445
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:54,117
You can tell that.

446
00:22:54,437 --> 00:22:56,500
Yup, 'cause look what I'm drawin'.

447
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:01,813
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

448
00:23:01,883 --> 00:23:03,133
What's up, Bobby?

449
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:04,641
It's almost midnight.

450
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:08,013
The only room you're gonna find
is a single room this stretch.

451
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,585
I also gave him the AAA discount.

452
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:10,702
He doesn't want the discount.

453
00:23:10,796 --> 00:23:12,022
You see my wife?

454
00:23:12,054 --> 00:23:13,632
- There? Okay?
- Yeah.

455
00:23:13,695 --> 00:23:16,304
She's Brazilian.
Brazilians love Disney.

456
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:18,194
She's been coming here
since she was a kid, all right?

457
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,907
And her dream is to have
her honeymoon at Disney.

458
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:21,594
Everybody--

459
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:23,360
Ma'am, they're just
trying to get a tip.

460
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:25,025
Yeah, kids are grateful!

461
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:28,074
{\an8}Hey, hey, kids, kids, uh, leave...

462
00:23:28,176 --> 00:23:30,019
{\an8}Come on, leave her alone.

463
00:23:37,011 --> 00:23:38,636
{\an8}I told ya.

464
00:24:01,765 --> 00:24:03,218
Does this have to be here?

465
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:09,059
Guests come through this door,
for Christ's sake, Bobby.

466
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,950
Will you go talk to her?
Tell her to go to the back.

467
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:14,270
Yes, sir.

468
00:24:16,015 --> 00:24:16,874
Excuse me.

469
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:18,222
- Uh, Hi!
- Uh, who's in charge here?

470
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:19,378
- Yeah, that's me!
- Hi.

471
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:20,207
- Hi!
- Uh...

472
00:24:20,246 --> 00:24:22,457
Could you move the van
to the back of the building?

473
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:23,720
- To the back of the building.
- Excuse me!

474
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:25,041
Right behind these
stairs right here?

475
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:26,196
Excuse me!

476
00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:27,423
What would you like?

477
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:29,423
I want that.
I want that, I want that.

478
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:31,776
- Enjoy your day.
- Thanks, thanks, thanks.

479
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:33,596
I want... that!

480
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:35,401
That, that, that, that, that.

481
00:24:35,444 --> 00:24:36,575
- Thanks.
- Yeah, yeah.

482
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,936
And I'll take the
raspberry croissant.

483
00:24:38,984 --> 00:24:39,984
I really appreciate...

484
00:24:40,055 --> 00:24:41,364
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

485
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:42,303
Have a nice day.

486
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:44,060
Okay, have a blessed day, sir.

487
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:45,428
- All right.
- Thank you so much.

488
00:24:45,463 --> 00:24:46,994
Okay, yeah, let's get it
packed up.

489
00:24:49,962 --> 00:24:52,020
Watch, watch this, watch, watch.

490
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:54,036
Watch. Watch. Watch. Watch.

491
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,391
Watch!

492
00:24:56,611 --> 00:24:59,246
- Stop.
- Spot.

493
00:25:00,262 --> 00:25:02,846
Aah.
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

494
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:04,991
Oooh, spider.

495
00:25:05,157 --> 00:25:06,938
Let's see if it farts.

496
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:10,691
Oh, fuck.

497
00:25:12,506 --> 00:25:14,569
I woulda worn gloves
if I knew there was bedbugs.

498
00:25:15,131 --> 00:25:15,803
What?

499
00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:18,381
I woulda worn gloves if you
told me there was bedbugs.

500
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,116
Well, the purple looks nice.

501
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:26,546
Yeah?

502
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:28,101
How much did that put you back?

503
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:32,001
Well, Narek spent about
20K on it.

504
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:34,196
And he can't afford
an exterminator?

505
00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:36,368
Huh?

506
00:25:36,462 --> 00:25:37,649
I don't know.

507
00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:42,555
Hey.

508
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:43,602
Hey.

509
00:25:43,946 --> 00:25:44,531
Uh...

510
00:25:44,556 --> 00:25:46,524
Y-you should be using
longer strips.

511
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:48,064
It works better.

512
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,001
Whatcha doin'?

513
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,610
- Top secret.
- Really?

514
00:26:00,635 --> 00:26:02,729
Guys...
I need you outta here.

515
00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:04,354
You guys are boring, anyway.

516
00:26:04,402 --> 00:26:05,792
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah.

517
00:26:06,236 --> 00:26:07,495
Catch you later.

518
00:26:23,068 --> 00:26:24,265
Fuck.

519
00:26:27,998 --> 00:26:29,057
Shit.

520
00:26:54,918 --> 00:26:56,606
I wanna play it.

521
00:26:56,994 --> 00:26:58,471
You guys share.

522
00:26:58,541 --> 00:26:59,978
Come on, let her play one time.

523
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:00,846
You gotta um...

524
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,361
Help her though.

525
00:27:02,643 --> 00:27:04,821
- Let me help.
- No, I'm on.

526
00:27:04,846 --> 00:27:06,640
- Let her figure it out.
- No, stop.

527
00:27:06,665 --> 00:27:07,758
Scooty, let her figure it out.

528
00:27:07,821 --> 00:27:10,024
No, she gotta play that game
that we were playing.

529
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:11,664
- That's the-- Yes.
- No.

530
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,821
No, she doesn't.

531
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:14,446
Let her do whatever she wants.

532
00:27:21,884 --> 00:27:22,713
Mmm.

533
00:27:38,663 --> 00:27:40,851
Thanks for calling The Magic Castle,
It's Amber.

534
00:27:41,968 --> 00:27:42,663
Yeah.

535
00:27:43,156 --> 00:27:44,156
We sure do.

536
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,359
It's $38 a night.

537
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,428
Well, we're here all night.

538
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,538
Yup.

539
00:27:53,658 --> 00:27:55,268
Alrighty, thanks a lot.

540
00:27:57,557 --> 00:27:59,236
- Okay, out.
- But.

541
00:27:59,268 --> 00:28:01,103
I warned you, one drip
and you're out.

542
00:28:01,128 --> 00:28:03,236
- Oh, come on!
- Out now.

543
00:28:03,261 --> 00:28:05,089
It's gonna melt outside.

544
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:07,667
Well, obviously,
it's meltin' inside, too.

545
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,566
- But Bobby?
- Out.

546
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:10,814
Ugh.

547
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,010
Thank you very much.

548
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,583
You're not welcome!

549
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,321
Bobby could be sucker city.

550
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:29,818
Gloria!

551
00:28:33,927 --> 00:28:36,217
I wanna knock! I wanna knock!
I wanna knock!

552
00:28:37,804 --> 00:28:38,805
We need Jancey!

553
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:41,054
Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, hey!

554
00:28:41,189 --> 00:28:43,228
One light knock will do, guys!

555
00:28:43,298 --> 00:28:44,353
I see her.

556
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,392
Come on, Jancey, come on!

557
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:50,375
Remember last time?

558
00:28:50,526 --> 00:28:53,056
She fell on the pool
'cause she was dancing.

559
00:28:54,013 --> 00:28:55,021
Come on, Scooty!

560
00:28:57,021 --> 00:28:57,810
Come on!

561
00:28:58,803 --> 00:28:59,889
Come on, Moonee, come on!

562
00:29:01,545 --> 00:29:02,881
Hey, Scooty!

563
00:29:03,514 --> 00:29:04,709
Hey, let's look!

564
00:29:12,296 --> 00:29:13,733
They look so funny.

565
00:29:16,326 --> 00:29:18,247
Moonee!
- I see the day go.

566
00:29:18,272 --> 00:29:20,147
I see the day go.

567
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,867
Guys.
Guys.

568
00:29:23,284 --> 00:29:25,620
- Come on!
- Guys, wait!

569
00:29:33,043 --> 00:29:33,871
Right there.

570
00:29:34,113 --> 00:29:35,746
Hey, let's see what she's doing.

571
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:37,371
Stretching her legs.

572
00:29:37,465 --> 00:29:37,972
Guys!

573
00:29:38,035 --> 00:29:39,543
Guys, she's stretching her legs.

574
00:29:39,918 --> 00:29:41,988
Moonee! Moonee, come on,
Moonee!

575
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:43,808
Coming!

576
00:29:44,191 --> 00:29:45,285
Look at her.

577
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:48,031
Hey, you guys, come on.

578
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:48,992
Right there.

579
00:29:51,546 --> 00:29:52,367
Come on.

580
00:30:00,502 --> 00:30:01,767
Boobies!

581
00:30:01,963 --> 00:30:04,611
- Boobies! Boobies!
- Boobies! Boobies!

582
00:30:04,963 --> 00:30:05,947
- Boobies!
- Boobies!

583
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:09,613
Hey, her boobies are so big
that I can rub my face in them.

584
00:30:14,778 --> 00:30:16,473
Banana boobs! Banana Boobs!

585
00:30:16,652 --> 00:30:17,512
Banana Boobs!

586
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:18,740
Guys, Bobby!

587
00:30:18,857 --> 00:30:20,208
Bobby! Duck!

588
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,700
Oh, no! Oh.

589
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,272
Get down!

590
00:30:23,717 --> 00:30:24,451
Scooty!

591
00:30:28,678 --> 00:30:29,857
Gloria...

592
00:30:30,271 --> 00:30:32,279
We talked about this before.
Cover up.

593
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:33,505
Cover what up?

594
00:30:33,724 --> 00:30:35,130
You know what I'm talking about.

595
00:30:35,255 --> 00:30:36,036
I do not know...

596
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:38,154
These kids don't need a
health class right now.

597
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:39,583
What kids are here?

598
00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:41,607
The kids are right over there!

599
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:44,560
Huh? Oh, they, they...

600
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:46,623
Well, they should be
in school, kids.

601
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:47,980
It's summer break.

602
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,537
Did he get her dressed?

603
00:30:51,631 --> 00:30:52,428
I think he did.

604
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,236
Can you read?
What's that say?

605
00:30:54,306 --> 00:30:55,079
Pool rules.

606
00:30:55,178 --> 00:30:56,468
No, the other one.

607
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,595
Oh, no tits allowed.

608
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:00,845
No. "No alcoholic beverages

609
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,126
in pool area."

610
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,713
Okay, I-I'll do that.

611
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,884
But I still wanna go topless
with my big titties.

612
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:06,931
Gloria, please!

613
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:07,588
Oh!

614
00:31:07,634 --> 00:31:09,142
It doesn't say no topless.

615
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:10,330
I think he's having
a talk with her.

616
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:12,798
Let me go see, stay down, guys.

617
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,154
I want, I want to see, just...

618
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,294
No, you're a beautiful woman...

619
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,646
Oh, no, Bobby's gonna ruin it...

620
00:31:17,802 --> 00:31:20,095
It's hot enough out here
without raising temperatures.

621
00:31:20,352 --> 00:31:21,977
Just put 'em away, cover 'em up.

622
00:31:22,055 --> 00:31:23,410
Oh, please, cover the fuck up?

623
00:31:23,472 --> 00:31:25,290
You cover yourself up, man.

624
00:31:25,356 --> 00:31:26,723
Does this happen all the time?

625
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:27,942
Yup.

626
00:31:28,074 --> 00:31:29,098
And it's great.

627
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:31,074
It's what we gotta do.

628
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,762
Ah-ah!

629
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:32,340
Hey!

630
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,481
- That's the way it works here.
- Oh-oh!

631
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,153
Oh-oh!

632
00:31:34,253 --> 00:31:37,191
He's abou--uh, call the Sheriff,
he just touched my tits.

633
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:38,839
Bobby, boobies!

634
00:31:40,035 --> 00:31:41,082
Go back to your room!

635
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:42,799
- He molested me, officer.
- Go!

636
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:44,560
I'm gonna sue this fuckin' motel.

637
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:47,798
With this fuckin' pervert
that just touched my fuckin' titties.

638
00:31:47,845 --> 00:31:50,174
Hey, Gloria! Rub--

639
00:31:50,353 --> 00:31:52,986
Rub your boobs on his face!

640
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:54,675
- So he can...
- Get the hell outta there!

641
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:55,754
Good one!

642
00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:57,973
- Rrweet.
- Rrweet.

643
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:00,449
- Rrweet.
- Rrweet.

644
00:32:01,082 --> 00:32:02,981
- Rrweet.
- Rrweet.

645
00:32:04,504 --> 00:32:06,886
- Kids, out.
- Yah!

646
00:32:07,753 --> 00:32:08,652
- Stop!
- Rrweet.

647
00:32:09,058 --> 00:32:10,346
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

648
00:32:16,577 --> 00:32:17,803
Ice machine.

649
00:32:17,873 --> 00:32:19,303
Yeah, well, it can't be fixed,
but I'm on it.

650
00:32:19,389 --> 00:32:20,748
- Three months.
- We need ice!

651
00:32:21,052 --> 00:32:22,498
- People need ice!
- I'm on it.

652
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:23,357
Three months.

653
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:24,177
Uh, Patrice?

654
00:32:24,888 --> 00:32:27,341
Uh, keep an eye on 151.

655
00:32:27,476 --> 00:32:29,585
There's been traffic
in and out of there all day.

656
00:32:31,553 --> 00:32:32,459
Really?

657
00:32:33,381 --> 00:32:34,240
Okay, okay.

658
00:32:35,014 --> 00:32:36,865
Uh, take care of it
in the morning.

659
00:32:37,131 --> 00:32:38,107
I can't whistle.

660
00:32:38,193 --> 00:32:38,967
- In the morning.

661
00:32:39,232 --> 00:32:40,311
You can't whistle?

662
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:42,271
You-you're gonna
have to train him,

663
00:32:42,302 --> 00:32:43,326
- Bobby.
- Pkkww!

664
00:32:43,427 --> 00:32:44,505
Stop it.

665
00:33:06,097 --> 00:33:07,129
Time to go!

666
00:33:11,644 --> 00:33:12,574
Come on!

667
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:13,680
Let's go!

668
00:33:15,313 --> 00:33:16,554
What the fuck is
you talkin' 'bout?

669
00:33:16,586 --> 00:33:18,320
I paid my room for a week now.

670
00:33:18,438 --> 00:33:20,008
I'm not leaving the property.

671
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:21,570
- I don't care!
- You're breakin'--

672
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:22,547
- I don't care!
- You're breakin' rules.

673
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:24,258
Nobody's breakin' rules!
What are you talkin' 'bout?

674
00:33:24,297 --> 00:33:26,414
How would you like it
if I called the Sheriff's office?

675
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:28,017
Oh, yeah? You gonna call
the Sheriff's office?

676
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:29,330
- Then we can figure things out.
- Go ahead!

677
00:33:29,385 --> 00:33:30,369
Oh, really? Really?

678
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:32,432
Your man knows
what the story is.

679
00:33:33,588 --> 00:33:34,783
Mom, can we get this one?

680
00:33:35,478 --> 00:33:37,439
No, we're-we're gonna get
these ones.

681
00:33:37,478 --> 00:33:39,189
We have to look
at these boxes, okay?

682
00:33:42,652 --> 00:33:45,090
If I buy more than 20,
can you give me a discount?

683
00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:48,566
This is wholesale.

684
00:33:48,851 --> 00:33:49,936
Mom, what about this one?

685
00:33:49,985 --> 00:33:51,960
You could smell
like Justin Bieber.

686
00:34:00,226 --> 00:34:01,039
Hey.

687
00:34:01,515 --> 00:34:03,453
Hey, we're selling perfumes.

688
00:34:03,514 --> 00:34:05,116
- Yeah, this one.
- No, listen...

689
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,545
It'll make your wife
smell really good!

690
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:10,866
You have Jimmy Choo?

691
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:12,866
Yeah, it's amazing.
It's only $20.

692
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:14,670
- Oh, let's see...
- It's so much more

693
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:16,975
expensive in the store,
It's a really good deal.

694
00:34:17,201 --> 00:34:18,558
Do you wanna buy some perfume?

695
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,481
Yes, ma'am?

696
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,746
Do you wanna buy some perfume?

697
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:22,485
- Not really, she might.
- No.

698
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,461
No? It smells like designer.

699
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:26,289
We were having
a really good deal.

700
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:29,492
Would you like to
buy some perfume?

701
00:34:29,586 --> 00:34:32,406
Yeah, this one will make
all the girls flirt on you.

702
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:34,640
I have samples if
you wanna try some.

703
00:34:34,718 --> 00:34:36,766
But we have a whole bunch
of different ones.

704
00:34:36,953 --> 00:34:38,070
Thank you so much.

705
00:34:38,132 --> 00:34:39,148
44?

706
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:42,023
- Yes!
- Girl! Whoop-whoop!

707
00:34:43,304 --> 00:34:45,702
Hey, hey. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

708
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:47,546
Seriously,

709
00:34:47,695 --> 00:34:49,195
if you gonna be late again,

710
00:34:49,343 --> 00:34:50,812
you gotta let me know.

711
00:34:50,991 --> 00:34:52,648
It was due yesterday.

712
00:34:53,085 --> 00:34:55,491
Yeah, that's right.
It's due yesterday.

713
00:34:55,622 --> 00:34:58,067
Whatev, are you gonna count it
like I'm broke?

714
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,458
I just gotta make sure.

715
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:03,309
Gotta make sure what?

716
00:35:03,737 --> 00:35:05,666
That it's the right amount.
It's a simple thing.

717
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:07,346
I just counted it.
I can't count?

718
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,471
You think I can't count?

719
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:09,909
Listen, all right.

720
00:35:10,846 --> 00:35:12,174
I trust you.

721
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:14,895
- Do you?
- Well, uh...

722
00:35:16,106 --> 00:35:17,715
- Ya got me.

723
00:35:17,872 --> 00:35:20,489
May I count it?
May I count it?

724
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:23,075
Good girl.
You got your rent.

725
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,776
Let me count it.
Get outta here.

726
00:35:24,987 --> 00:35:26,276
- Bye.
- Bye.

727
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:30,283
Dicky!

728
00:35:31,197 --> 00:35:32,627
You wanna say bye to your room?

729
00:35:32,987 --> 00:35:34,721
- Nah.
- You good?

730
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,362
They have rides there.

731
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:37,651
They have rides-- awesome.

732
00:35:38,322 --> 00:35:40,104
Hey, Dicky, I can't take this, bud.

733
00:35:41,174 --> 00:35:42,901
Look, there's no room
in here at all.

734
00:35:43,272 --> 00:35:45,788
I'm gonna buy you new toys when we
get to New Orleans, okay? I promise.

735
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,631
Come on, guys,
take whatever you want.

736
00:35:47,702 --> 00:35:48,655
Whoo!

737
00:35:48,795 --> 00:35:50,029
Just grab whatever
you want outta there.

738
00:35:50,092 --> 00:35:51,295
That is nice!

739
00:35:51,505 --> 00:35:53,196
- Here you go, guys.
- I got the gun!

740
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:55,225
- Aah!
- Dad, please!

741
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:59,920
All new stuff, Dicky.
All new stuff, Dicky.

742
00:35:59,945 --> 00:36:00,530
Okay.

743
00:36:00,555 --> 00:36:02,461
- Just imagine, all new stuff.
- Fine.

744
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,258
My mom said have fun.

745
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:05,648
All right, guys.

746
00:36:05,812 --> 00:36:07,054
You can have the whole box.

747
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,773
Take the whole box with you,
go ahead.

748
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:10,523
Bye, Joyce. Bye.

749
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,445
Yo, T, take care, bro, all right?

750
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:15,359
You hold this place down for me
while I'm gone, ya heard?

751
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:17,578
- Be good, okay, sweetie?
- Okay.

752
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,095
Bye, Dicky!

753
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,110
- See you later.
- See you later.

754
00:36:37,163 --> 00:36:39,235
Hey, you wanna
see something cool?

755
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:40,984
Yeah.

756
00:36:41,687 --> 00:36:44,179
Okay, make sure
you don't tell anyone.

757
00:36:44,218 --> 00:36:45,046
Okay.

758
00:36:45,796 --> 00:36:48,163
Look. And it has
a naked girl on it!

759
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:52,859
Did you steal that?

760
00:36:54,203 --> 00:36:54,913
Eh.

761
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:57,617
Moon, Scoot!

762
00:36:58,203 --> 00:36:59,804
Yeah, Mom?!

763
00:37:00,071 --> 00:37:02,360
Get off your butts and
go get some waffles!

764
00:37:03,102 --> 00:37:05,211
My mom wanted extra maple syrup.

765
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:06,242
It's in there.

766
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:08,758
Okay, guys, go.
Have fun, be careful.

767
00:37:08,805 --> 00:37:09,414
Okay.

768
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:12,274
Hey, cutie, it's actually for me.

769
00:37:13,914 --> 00:37:15,586
Are you twerking over there?

770
00:37:16,852 --> 00:37:18,313
Okay, I'll do more.

771
00:37:19,086 --> 00:37:20,032
Let me see. Hey!

772
00:37:20,265 --> 00:37:21,945
Hey, hey, hey!

773
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:22,860
Mommy!

774
00:37:24,474 --> 00:37:25,919
Oh, wow!

775
00:37:26,028 --> 00:37:28,309
You got some twerk skills, girl.

776
00:37:28,606 --> 00:37:29,840
Yasss!

777
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:31,302
Watch me shake my booty?

778
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:33,255
- Oooh!
- Wanna watch me shake my booty!

779
00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:34,411
Oooh!

780
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:46,933
Yo, you heard this song, right?

781
00:37:52,498 --> 00:37:53,779
Wait, hold up, wait, bitch.

782
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,701
Did that guy from
OBT ever call you?

783
00:37:56,249 --> 00:37:56,991
Yeah.

784
00:37:57,218 --> 00:37:58,726
What's good with that?

785
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,249
He's mad as fuckin' whack.

786
00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:03,062
I tried to show a hand.

787
00:38:03,804 --> 00:38:05,007
He doesn't like it.

788
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,267
Ew.

789
00:38:07,673 --> 00:38:08,806
Goodbye, goodnight.

790
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,571
Take several seats.

791
00:38:14,438 --> 00:38:16,235
Yo, by the way...

792
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,142
You gotta do me a fuckin' favor.

793
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:20,884
Next time...

794
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:22,993
Moonee comes to you...

795
00:38:23,306 --> 00:38:24,423
to get food...

796
00:38:24,742 --> 00:38:26,851
don't give her no
fuckin' maple syrup!

797
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:29,703
This bitch has been farting!

798
00:38:30,164 --> 00:38:32,008
Goodnight, bitch, I love you!

799
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,773
Love you, night, bitch!

800
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:43,163
I'm gonna kiss it.

801
00:38:43,694 --> 00:38:44,905
Crushing.

802
00:38:45,046 --> 00:38:47,788
Can I have a crush on
the ice cream, guy?

803
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,735
Mmm, it's pretty good.

804
00:38:56,054 --> 00:38:57,077
Hey, kids!

805
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:59,130
Hey! How many times
have I told you

806
00:38:59,155 --> 00:39:00,835
that you can't be
hanging out there?

807
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,242
- Let people eat.
- Paying customers!

808
00:39:02,267 --> 00:39:04,109
I don't care, you can't be
bothering my customers.

809
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,254
- No!
- Go on, get out!

810
00:39:05,286 --> 00:39:06,661
You don't tell us what to do!

811
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:07,661
Hey!

812
00:39:08,636 --> 00:39:10,839
- Yeah, lady!
- Be quiet.

813
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:14,256
Hey, hey, girls, come on.

814
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,255
- I'm working here.
- We're hiding! This is serious, Bobby!

815
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,123
- I'm working.
- We need to hide! We need to hide!

816
00:39:19,186 --> 00:39:20,983
We need to hide!
Go, go, go, go, go!

817
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:22,037
All right, but...

818
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,646
Now, be quiet.

819
00:39:24,243 --> 00:39:25,986
And watch those
wires down there.

820
00:39:27,956 --> 00:39:29,307
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

821
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:31,511
Watch the wires
down there, girls!

822
00:39:31,573 --> 00:39:32,589
No, no, no, no.

823
00:39:37,299 --> 00:39:38,494
Have you seen Moo--?

824
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,306
Yes!

825
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:41,010
Don't blow our cover.

826
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:43,396
Where's Moonee and Jancey?

827
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,717
I got you! I got you!

828
00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:48,975
I got you good, yeah!

829
00:39:49,185 --> 00:39:50,584
Move, Bobby!

830
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:52,099
- Excuse me.
- Move!

831
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:08,570
Have a safe trip!

832
00:40:10,226 --> 00:40:11,554
Halooyah!

833
00:40:12,074 --> 00:40:14,324
Hallelujah, thank you,
Lord Jesus!

834
00:40:15,684 --> 00:40:18,395
- No boys allowed!
- No!

835
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:20,626
- No boy!
- No.

836
00:40:23,063 --> 00:40:23,915
Shut up!

837
00:40:24,774 --> 00:40:25,508
Damn.

838
00:40:28,953 --> 00:40:30,156
Hi, kids.

839
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:33,453
You having fun?

840
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:35,406
This is a girl's table!

841
00:40:49,203 --> 00:40:51,515
Oh! Fuck! Shit!

842
00:40:52,844 --> 00:40:53,500
What the fuck?!

843
00:40:53,586 --> 00:40:54,679
I'm sorry, buddy!

844
00:40:54,742 --> 00:40:56,023
- You almost killed me!
- It was an accident.

845
00:40:56,195 --> 00:40:57,906
- Fuck, man!
- Okay, I'm sorry, man.

846
00:40:57,937 --> 00:40:59,515
- Punk ass bitch!
- Whoa.

847
00:40:59,556 --> 00:41:00,313
Whoa.

848
00:41:01,212 --> 00:41:03,272
What's your name?
- Huh?

849
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:04,376
Huh?

850
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:07,150
- What's your name?
- Excuse me, can I help you?

851
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:09,717
Uh, no, that's okay.

852
00:41:09,787 --> 00:41:11,006
Uh, what's okay?

853
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:13,132
Moonee, get off that picnic table!

854
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:15,258
People eat on that thing,
come on, girl.

855
00:41:16,399 --> 00:41:17,328
You're a guest here?

856
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,659
Uh... no... I'm... looking for...
a-a soda machine.

857
00:41:22,752 --> 00:41:25,408
You come to a motel
to get a soda?

858
00:41:25,815 --> 00:41:26,877
Yeah, uh...

859
00:41:27,135 --> 00:41:28,486
It's okay, I-I-I-I...

860
00:41:28,705 --> 00:41:30,291
- appreciate it, thank you...
- No, no, come on, come on.

861
00:41:30,338 --> 00:41:31,299
Come with me.

862
00:41:31,346 --> 00:41:32,197
- Come with me.
- No, no, you don't understand.

863
00:41:32,222 --> 00:41:33,658
Yeah, I know where
there's a soda machine.

864
00:41:34,197 --> 00:41:35,510
- No, no, I...
- Just come with me.

865
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,846
You don't un... uh...

866
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:38,080
You want a soda, right?

867
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:41,384
Yeah, yeah, I think the...
I was passin' by on the high...

868
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,541
- On the road...
- Get off that picnic table!

869
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:45,877
- Yeah? Yeah?
- I was just passin' by...

870
00:41:45,926 --> 00:41:48,377
and-and I wanted
to get a soda 'cause uh...

871
00:41:48,642 --> 00:41:50,619
- I needed a soda.
- You were parched, huh?

872
00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:52,791
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

873
00:41:52,838 --> 00:41:55,088
You wanted to
whet that palate, right?

874
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:56,619
Yeah.

875
00:41:57,252 --> 00:42:00,369
I never did get used to the-
the humidity here.

876
00:42:00,415 --> 00:42:02,876
It's okay, uh...
machine's up there.

877
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:03,595
Uh...

878
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,869
So, you like soda, huh?

879
00:42:04,953 --> 00:42:07,672
Uh, yeah, yeah, it's-it's...
it's good.

880
00:42:07,751 --> 00:42:08,946
Yeah, you know,

881
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,712
I read in a magazine that

882
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:14,473
soda's not so good
for quenching your thirst.

883
00:42:14,872 --> 00:42:16,356
Oh, I agree, yeah, yeah.

884
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:18,153
Had you noticed that?
You know what's better?

885
00:42:18,216 --> 00:42:19,278
- What?
- Tea.

886
00:42:19,481 --> 00:42:22,184
- T-tea?
- Tea. Hot tea, hot tea.

887
00:42:22,278 --> 00:42:23,434
Yeah, yeah, I drink that.

888
00:42:23,512 --> 00:42:25,989
- You do? Okay.
- Yeah...

889
00:42:26,216 --> 00:42:28,341
No, no, it's uh, it's right up here.

890
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,754
Just a little more ways.

891
00:42:29,793 --> 00:42:32,629
You came for a soda,
we're gonna get you a soda, right?

892
00:42:33,075 --> 00:42:34,613
- Yeah, but I-I wanted to...
- Is that so?

893
00:42:34,676 --> 00:42:36,825
Have to have a walk,
I have to do a walk...

894
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,661
Yeah? Well, you're gettin' a walk.

895
00:42:38,793 --> 00:42:41,434
It's right up here.
You're gettin' your soda...

896
00:42:42,795 --> 00:42:44,014
and you came out in a walk...

897
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:05,725
What a choice.

898
00:43:06,342 --> 00:43:08,474
- Okay. Thank you.
- Hey!

899
00:43:09,577 --> 00:43:11,779
- I thought you were thirsty?
- Yeah.

900
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:15,600
- Aren't you gonna drink it now?
- Yeah, yeah.

901
00:43:21,072 --> 00:43:23,830
- Good?
- Sure.

902
00:43:24,861 --> 00:43:26,010
Get the fuck outta here.

903
00:43:26,963 --> 00:43:28,611
You come on this property again,

904
00:43:28,636 --> 00:43:30,572
and you won't be leavin' it.
You understand?

905
00:43:30,697 --> 00:43:32,135
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

906
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:33,588
You don't know
what I'm talkin' about?

907
00:43:34,377 --> 00:43:35,815
You're gonna play it
that way, huh?

908
00:43:40,143 --> 00:43:40,846
Hey!

909
00:43:41,556 --> 00:43:42,517
- Hey!
- All right.

910
00:43:43,642 --> 00:43:45,978
"Charlie... Coachman"

911
00:43:46,822 --> 00:43:48,150
of Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

912
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:50,142
You can't keep that,
that's my license.

913
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:52,089
I'm gonna call your name...

914
00:43:52,944 --> 00:43:54,397
into the County Sheriff.

915
00:43:54,663 --> 00:43:56,156
Now, you get the fuck outta here!

916
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:57,164
What's your business--?

917
00:44:01,903 --> 00:44:03,098
Get goin'!

918
00:44:04,424 --> 00:44:05,541
Get goin'!

919
00:44:07,798 --> 00:44:08,923
Don't you stop!

920
00:44:26,001 --> 00:44:27,705
I'm making a sand castle.

921
00:44:28,438 --> 00:44:29,391
Excuse me?

922
00:44:29,743 --> 00:44:30,962
Do you wanna buy some perfume?

923
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,930
- Sorry?
- Do you wanna buy some perfume?

924
00:44:32,955 --> 00:44:34,133
I'm selling perfume.

925
00:44:34,227 --> 00:44:35,751
I have no cash on me.

926
00:44:35,837 --> 00:44:37,212
Okay, thank you.

927
00:44:38,415 --> 00:44:39,329
No, thank you.

928
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:40,977
This will make you handsome.

929
00:44:41,002 --> 00:44:41,841
Come on.

930
00:44:42,036 --> 00:44:44,067
Actually, actually, sir...

931
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:45,974
Can you just give us
a couple of bucks?

932
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,114
Just for me and my kid?

933
00:44:47,192 --> 00:44:48,700
If you're not gonna
buy the perfume.

934
00:44:48,872 --> 00:44:50,528
- Look...
- Please?

935
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:56,246
- Have a great day, okay?
- Thank you so much!

936
00:44:56,738 --> 00:44:57,722
Yes!

937
00:44:59,275 --> 00:45:01,908
Tilt your head back.
Tilt your head back.

938
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:13,214
- You want to get wet?
- No. No! No!

939
00:45:19,982 --> 00:45:23,435
Jancey, this is gonna be
a scary!

940
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:24,685
Yeah!

941
00:45:24,778 --> 00:45:25,966
There's ghosts hanging out...

942
00:45:26,796 --> 00:45:29,140
It's got--
Are we going there?

943
00:45:29,804 --> 00:45:31,523
No, you'll see.

944
00:45:34,418 --> 00:45:35,239
It's...

945
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:38,333
Speaking...

946
00:45:43,984 --> 00:45:45,866
Hakah... Tetah...

947
00:45:45,914 --> 00:45:48,203
- What?
- Hakah tetah.

948
00:45:48,352 --> 00:45:49,367
Yeah, I got it.

949
00:45:49,616 --> 00:45:51,124
Hey, you wanna see a joke?

950
00:45:51,405 --> 00:45:52,140
What?

951
00:45:54,515 --> 00:45:55,257
Ready?

952
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:57,043
Voila!

953
00:45:57,678 --> 00:45:58,803
Wait for me, guys.

954
00:45:59,342 --> 00:46:01,394
What a gentleman you are.

955
00:46:03,163 --> 00:46:04,436
Mm-mm, yeah.

956
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,069
Mm-mm-mm-tchww.

957
00:46:06,155 --> 00:46:07,194
Ah...

958
00:46:08,108 --> 00:46:09,233
Uh-uh-uh, pkkw.

959
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,131
Yeah.

960
00:46:12,643 --> 00:46:14,446
Scooty, will you marry me?

961
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,096
Well, not...
right now.

962
00:46:17,136 --> 00:46:17,806
Aah!

963
00:46:18,455 --> 00:46:21,416
- You may kiss the bride.
- I said not right now!

964
00:46:21,463 --> 00:46:23,322
- Ew.
- Ew!

965
00:46:24,213 --> 00:46:25,760
What is this place?

966
00:46:26,276 --> 00:46:27,580
The abandoneds.

967
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:28,736
One!

968
00:46:29,502 --> 00:46:30,565
Two!

969
00:46:31,502 --> 00:46:32,260
Three!

970
00:46:32,847 --> 00:46:34,237
- Oooh!
- Aaah!

971
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:36,354
Ha.

972
00:46:39,857 --> 00:46:41,989
Hey, you know there's
alligators in there?

973
00:46:42,575 --> 00:46:43,388
Really?

974
00:46:45,248 --> 00:46:45,920
Wha--

975
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:49,240
If I had a pet alligator,
I would name mine Anne.

976
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:53,231
Ha!

977
00:46:53,654 --> 00:46:54,904
Ooh, look, a pillow.

978
00:46:56,646 --> 00:46:57,599
Cool.

979
00:46:58,881 --> 00:47:00,810
I... I bet... this house

980
00:47:00,866 --> 00:47:03,264
was built hundreds of years ago.

981
00:47:03,381 --> 00:47:04,951
Oh, this could be a dance room.

982
00:47:05,173 --> 00:47:08,329
Party! With beer. Party!
With beer.

983
00:47:08,806 --> 00:47:12,458
Party! With beer. Party!
With beer.

984
00:47:13,136 --> 00:47:15,910
Oh, my God, come here, Jancey!

985
00:47:15,972 --> 00:47:17,160
Ghost poop.

986
00:47:17,863 --> 00:47:19,004
- Eww!
- Aaah!

987
00:47:19,894 --> 00:47:21,043
Yay!

988
00:47:23,168 --> 00:47:24,145
Little...

989
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,224
This... would be... my bed.

990
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,787
And that would be my bookshelf.

991
00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:34,068
No, actually, my bed would be
right in the middle.

992
00:47:34,154 --> 00:47:36,052
And lots of toys!

993
00:47:40,197 --> 00:47:41,064
Scooty!

994
00:47:41,424 --> 00:47:42,807
What are you breaking?

995
00:47:43,221 --> 00:47:44,369
The wall.

996
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:50,025
Good luck!

997
00:47:54,816 --> 00:47:55,706
Whoo-hoo!

998
00:47:57,463 --> 00:47:58,815
Bye!

999
00:47:59,104 --> 00:48:00,580
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1000
00:48:01,848 --> 00:48:04,145
Whoa, a fireplace.

1001
00:48:04,777 --> 00:48:06,871
Hunh! I have the best idea.

1002
00:48:06,965 --> 00:48:08,067
Scooty!

1003
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,160
We need you right now!

1004
00:48:10,215 --> 00:48:11,418
Put it there.

1005
00:48:11,465 --> 00:48:13,481
This is gonna be
the best fire ever.

1006
00:48:13,574 --> 00:48:14,988
Light it up, Scooty!

1007
00:48:15,074 --> 00:48:16,754
Yup, light it up.

1008
00:48:25,442 --> 00:48:28,044
Whoa, guys, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

1009
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:30,208
We're gonna be in
so much trouble!

1010
00:48:30,233 --> 00:48:31,294
No. Um. Just.

1011
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:33,231
Jancey, go home.
Um. Bye.

1012
00:48:33,256 --> 00:48:35,092
Don't tell anyone.
Don't tell your grandma.

1013
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:36,850
- Okay, bye, bye.
- Okay.

1014
00:48:37,771 --> 00:48:39,435
Don't tell anyone!

1015
00:48:39,551 --> 00:48:40,543
Okay!

1016
00:48:41,957 --> 00:48:43,058
Scooty.

1017
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:46,019
Don't. Tell. Your mom. Okay?

1018
00:48:46,152 --> 00:48:47,098
Okay.

1019
00:48:49,637 --> 00:48:50,731
Excuse me.

1020
00:48:52,186 --> 00:48:53,147
Moon!

1021
00:48:53,178 --> 00:48:55,514
The old condo is on fire.
You wanna go check them out?

1022
00:49:01,636 --> 00:49:02,620
Whoo!

1023
00:49:09,421 --> 00:49:10,381
Scooty, come on!

1024
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,155
Don't you wanna see
the burning house?

1025
00:49:12,468 --> 00:49:15,936
Nah. I just wanna
stay here and watch TV.

1026
00:49:17,336 --> 00:49:18,047
Scooty?

1027
00:49:18,149 --> 00:49:20,298
Hurry up, bitch.
I don't wanna miss it.

1028
00:49:20,346 --> 00:49:21,877
Yo, grab my cigarettes.

1029
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:24,674
- I'll meet you there.
- Hurry up, bitch!

1030

1031
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:30,983

Look at me.

1035
00:49:35,888 --> 00:49:37,795
You tell me the truth right now.

1036
00:49:38,879 --> 00:49:41,535
Do you understand what will
happen to us if you did this?

1037
00:49:42,371 --> 00:49:45,121
Do you want the fuckin'
DCF down here, Scooty?

1038
00:49:45,184 --> 00:49:47,714
<i>Blue, pink, green, and more!</i>

1043
00:49:53,948 --> 00:49:56,862
You need to tell me
the truth right now.

1044
00:49:57,151 --> 00:49:58,557
I didn't do it.

1045
00:49:58,799 --> 00:49:59,729
Don't lie to me.

1046
00:49:59,893 --> 00:50:01,213
Please don't lie to me.

1047
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:02,768

00:50:06,662 --> 00:50:07,731
This is not a joke right now.

1052
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:09,108
I need to know!

1053
00:50:09,389 --> 00:50:10,866
Firemen coming!

1054
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:12,491
Get 'em!

1055
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:14,881
Yay!

1056
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:16,389
Whoo!

1057
00:50:18,623 --> 00:50:19,850
Hey, girl!

1058
00:50:20,002 --> 00:50:21,447
What the fuck happened?

1059
00:50:21,494 --> 00:50:22,838
Aren't you excited?

1060
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:24,932
This so much better than TV.

1061
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:28,103
Can I take a picture of you?
I wanna send it to Ashley.

1062
00:50:28,128 --> 00:50:29,346
Stand right there.

1063
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:31,244
Smile, girlfriend.

1064
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:34,767
It used to be a big
crackhead spot.

1065
00:50:34,837 --> 00:50:36,634
Prostitutin' and all that.

1066
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:39,314
Let it burn!
Let it burn!

1067
00:50:46,236 --> 00:50:47,541
Got another one of those?

1068
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:49,915
For you?

1069
00:50:52,563 --> 00:50:54,337
- Here, babe.
- Thanks.

1070
00:50:59,327 --> 00:51:01,366
You just like me
for my cigarettes now.

1071
00:51:01,483 --> 00:51:02,334
No.

1072
00:51:02,607 --> 00:51:03,919
That's right.
You wouldn't even have

1073
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:05,335
- said hello
- That's not so.

1074
00:51:05,397 --> 00:51:07,413
If I didn't have cigarettes.

1075
00:51:07,438 --> 00:51:09,140
- That's not true.
- No wonder I don't like you.

1076
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:11,731
It could have been arson.

1077
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,192
Could have been.

1078
00:51:14,217 --> 00:51:15,340
I don't know.

1079
00:51:15,365 --> 00:51:18,774
They were so fuckin' ugly,
<i>I</i> was thinkin' of burning 'em down.

1080
00:51:30,748 --> 00:51:31,990
Ashley?

1081
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:34,862
Hi, Miss Ashley.

1082
00:51:34,995 --> 00:51:35,925
Is Scooty here?

1083
00:51:35,964 --> 00:51:38,574
Moonee, tell your mom,
no more food. Okay?

1084
00:51:39,894 --> 00:51:40,971
Okay...

1085
00:51:41,034 --> 00:51:42,425
I have to go work, okay?

1086
00:51:42,511 --> 00:51:44,456
- Is Scooty here?
- No, he's not.

1087
00:51:44,604 --> 00:51:45,604
Well, he's not at home.

1088
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:47,073
Yeah, I know,
he's with my friends.

1089
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:50,620
Well, could you please
give me the address?

1090
00:51:50,815 --> 00:51:53,112
Look, you can't
come around anymore.

1091
00:51:53,175 --> 00:51:55,573
And I don't want you hanging
out Scooty anymore. You got it?

1092
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:57,768
I have to go.

1093
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,230
Yasss!

1094
00:52:09,332 --> 00:52:11,668
Hey, Ashley, you fucking
see this shit?!

1095
00:52:13,145 --> 00:52:14,254
Oh, shit!

1096
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,397
Whoa!

1097
00:52:18,249 --> 00:52:19,053
God!

1098
00:52:19,788 --> 00:52:22,186
World star!

1099
00:52:22,361 --> 00:52:23,611
How-how 'bout this...

1100
00:52:23,947 --> 00:52:24,908
No more

1101
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,932
lettin' people run over other
people in the fuckin' parking lot?

1102
00:52:28,002 --> 00:52:28,846
How 'bout that?

1103
00:52:28,885 --> 00:52:30,477
Bobby, I didn't--I-I

1104
00:52:30,502 --> 00:52:32,283
- I couldn't do anything!
- What's wrong with you?

1105
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:33,847
'Cause this, this can't
be happening.

1106
00:52:33,872 --> 00:52:35,310
Fucking come back
there, little fucker out.

1107
00:52:35,864 --> 00:52:37,138
You fucking kidding me?

1108
00:52:38,895 --> 00:52:41,497
<i>That we can do for you</i>

1109
00:52:41,623 --> 00:52:44,068
Go run and
get some waffles, baby.

1110
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,857
And where the fuck is Scooty?

1111
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:00,626
Yo.

1112
00:53:00,651 --> 00:53:02,620
- Hi, Scooty.
- Hi, Halley.

1113
00:53:02,738 --> 00:53:05,472
Moonee's gonna hit the pool.
Does Scooty wanna come with her?

1114
00:53:06,051 --> 00:53:09,113
Uh, Ashley doesn't think that's
a good idea right now. Sorry.

1115
00:53:09,183 --> 00:53:10,480
The fuck does that mean?

1116
00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:12,105
Halley, Halley, calm down,
calm down.

1117
00:53:20,346 --> 00:53:21,908
Hi, here you go.

1118
00:53:23,462 --> 00:53:25,384
I want <i>her</i> to take my order.

1119
00:53:28,165 --> 00:53:29,384
Oh, it's you.

1120
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,870
Never seen you inside before.

1121
00:53:33,399 --> 00:53:34,875
Okay. Hold on.

1122
00:53:42,906 --> 00:53:44,647
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

1123
00:53:46,164 --> 00:53:47,461
What do you want, Halley?

1124
00:53:48,007 --> 00:53:49,141
What's going on?

1125
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,259
What do you mean?

1126
00:53:51,445 --> 00:53:54,461
You've been telling my daughter
she ain't welcome here no more?

1127
00:53:56,175 --> 00:53:58,979
Look, she can come in here...

1128
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,604
but I can't keep
givin' out free food.

1129
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:03,948
Shit, am I in trouble?

1130
00:54:04,065 --> 00:54:06,370
And I don't want Scooty
hangin' out with her...

1131
00:54:06,573 --> 00:54:08,760
or that new kid from FutureLand.

1132
00:54:09,574 --> 00:54:10,488
Okay.

1133
00:54:11,054 --> 00:54:13,351
So you ain't getting trouble,
what's going on?

1134
00:54:14,367 --> 00:54:15,390
Nothing.

1135
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,815
Nothing to discuss.

1136
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,263
- Really?
- Really.

1137
00:54:22,603 --> 00:54:23,775
Yo!

1138
00:54:24,408 --> 00:54:25,955
What type of service is that?

1139
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:28,103
You gonna come take my order?

1140
00:54:33,665 --> 00:54:34,704
Moonee...

1141
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:36,351
Order whatever
the fuck you want.

1142
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:37,343
We're staying here...

1143
00:54:37,368 --> 00:54:38,766
- All. Fucking. Day.
- Aaaah!

1144
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,789
Yes!

1145
00:54:39,867 --> 00:54:41,335
I want strawberry waffles

1146
00:54:41,413 --> 00:54:43,750
with extra, <i>extra</i>

1147
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:45,320
warm syrup.

1148
00:54:45,578 --> 00:54:47,734
And I want eggs, bacon,

1149
00:54:47,968 --> 00:54:51,170
and... strawberries,
and blueberries,

1150
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,973
and Coke, root beer,
and lemonade, Sprite.

1151
00:54:55,848 --> 00:54:56,801
You.

1152
00:54:57,771 --> 00:54:59,279
You sure that's it?
You could order more.

1153
00:54:59,304 --> 00:55:01,560
I told you anything you want.

1154
00:55:01,748 --> 00:55:04,217
I actually want extra bacon.

1155
00:55:04,911 --> 00:55:06,489
Lots of bacon.

1156
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:10,411
And fresh jelly.
Don't forget that.

1157
00:55:10,488 --> 00:55:11,574
You got all that?

1158
00:55:11,613 --> 00:55:13,167
You got money to pay for this?

1159
00:55:13,339 --> 00:55:15,511
Don't worry 'bout my pockets.
I got money.

1160
00:55:15,722 --> 00:55:16,574
Okay.

1161
00:55:16,832 --> 00:55:18,503
And I got money, too.

1162
00:55:20,185 --> 00:55:22,349
- Mmmm!
- I have an idea.

1163
00:55:22,431 --> 00:55:24,423
You wanna have
a burping contest?

1164
00:55:24,842 --> 00:55:26,420
Are you serious?

1165
00:55:26,487 --> 00:55:28,174
I know you wanna have
a burping contest.

1166
00:55:28,214 --> 00:55:30,269
- You go first.
- Good.

1167
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:41,026
That was a good one!

1168
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,760
You got another one?

1169
00:55:42,877 --> 00:55:44,448
Yeah. Here it goes...

1170
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,472
Here it goes...

1171
00:55:50,935 --> 00:55:52,006
Oh, my God.

1172
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:53,333
You try to burp.

1173
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,005
I want the rest to go.

1174
00:56:06,443 --> 00:56:07,537
You gonna pack this up for me?

1175
00:56:07,562 --> 00:56:10,396
Or do I gotta tell someone
what I feel about the service here?

1176
00:56:19,117 --> 00:56:21,305
Say hi to Scooty for me.

1177
00:56:28,872 --> 00:56:31,279
Mom, why did you do that?

1178
00:56:33,379 --> 00:56:34,793
Gonna squeeze out.

1179
00:56:34,864 --> 00:56:36,520
I told you, you gotta spin.

1180
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,614
- I am.
- No, no.

1181
00:56:38,739 --> 00:56:39,981
Clockwise.

1182
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,848
I am! This is clockwise.

1183
00:56:42,097 --> 00:56:43,870
No... I-I guess counterclockwise.

1184
00:56:48,422 --> 00:56:49,493
Pull!

1185
00:56:53,142 --> 00:56:54,298
Gotta spin it.

1186
00:56:54,399 --> 00:56:55,204
I am.

1187
00:57:06,233 --> 00:57:08,842
By the way, I told her
happy birthday for you.

1188
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:11,905
- But I didn't.
- Come on, push.

1189
00:57:11,983 --> 00:57:12,600
But I didn't.

1190
00:57:12,632 --> 00:57:13,413
- Push.
- I didn't.

1191
00:57:13,466 --> 00:57:15,591
Why'd you do that?
Why would you do that?

1192
00:57:16,904 --> 00:57:18,693
Now, you call her
and tell her...

1193
00:57:18,794 --> 00:57:19,857
I didn't.

1194
00:57:20,122 --> 00:57:21,435
Can you please?

1195
00:57:21,552 --> 00:57:23,122
Hey, first, first...

1196
00:57:23,224 --> 00:57:24,919
you get her on the phone...

1197
00:57:25,224 --> 00:57:27,583
and you tell her I didn't
wish her anything, damn it.

1198
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:42,987
You know what?

1199
00:57:43,089 --> 00:57:44,152
Keep the money.

1200
00:57:45,027 --> 00:57:46,230
Keep it.

1201
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:49,647
I thought that...
appreciated the extra work.

1202
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:52,625
No! It takes an hour and a half
just to drive here.

1203
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:55,030
You totally screwed up
my Saturday.

1204
00:57:55,101 --> 00:57:56,706
I don't need the extra work.

1205
00:57:57,781 --> 00:57:59,453
Give the money to him.
He needs it.

1206
00:58:00,242 --> 00:58:02,289
Or tell your boss
to hire an extra hand.

1207
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:07,993
Please just take the money.
I really don't need it.

1208
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:09,946
I can't do this anymore.

1209
00:58:10,008 --> 00:58:11,196
I'm done.

1210
00:58:11,304 --> 00:58:12,601
Okay, but...

1211
00:58:12,687 --> 00:58:13,796
This thing.

1212
00:58:14,022 --> 00:58:16,202
Help me bring this downstairs.

1213
00:58:19,176 --> 00:58:20,090
Go on.

1214
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,035
Finish what you started.

1215
00:58:35,563 --> 00:58:37,688
- You gonna press the button?
- Oh, yeah.

1216
00:58:58,913 --> 00:59:01,812
This one...
smells really good.

1217
00:59:03,898 --> 00:59:05,726
- No?
- Thank you.

1218
00:59:05,781 --> 00:59:06,804
Okay, thank you.

1219
00:59:06,914 --> 00:59:08,054
- Thanks, bye.
- Hey!

1220
00:59:08,187 --> 00:59:09,632
- Hey!
- Oh, fuck.

1221
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:11,344
Excuse me, lady!

1222
00:59:12,077 --> 00:59:13,031
Hey!

1223
00:59:14,241 --> 00:59:15,960
Hey!
We're leaving!

1224
00:59:16,046 --> 00:59:17,561
- We're leaving!
- I need you guys to come back inside.

1225
00:59:18,386 --> 00:59:19,465
Do you hear me?

1226
00:59:19,528 --> 00:59:20,614
We're leaving!

1227
00:59:21,637 --> 00:59:22,684
Come on.

1228
00:59:22,899 --> 00:59:23,884
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1229
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:25,282
You were soliciting in our building,
you can't do that.

1230
00:59:25,307 --> 00:59:27,188
You're not even a real cop!

1231
00:59:27,252 --> 00:59:28,330
Hey, I'm just doing
my job here, all right?

1232
00:59:28,355 --> 00:59:29,502
You can't do that
on our property.

1233
00:59:29,527 --> 00:59:31,268
I already called the cops.
You gotta go back inside with me.

1234
00:59:31,456 --> 00:59:32,596
Get off your power trip.

1235
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:34,721
You're driving a golf cart.
Okay?

1236
00:59:34,746 --> 00:59:35,619
I need you to come back
right now.

1237
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,246
If you're leaving,
I gotta confiscate that.

1238
00:59:37,504 --> 00:59:39,230
I need you... give me...

1239
00:59:39,636 --> 00:59:40,730
- Fuck!
- Wanna do this right now?

1240
00:59:40,755 --> 00:59:42,300
You're a fucking bitch!

1241
00:59:42,668 --> 00:59:44,011
Come back here!

1242
00:59:45,383 --> 00:59:47,625
Why'd you let her
have our perfume?

1243
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,667
It's complicated, baby.

1244
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:51,214
But why?

1245
00:59:52,814 --> 00:59:54,666
I can't get arrested again.

1246
00:59:55,032 --> 00:59:56,938
Could we go for ice cream.

1247
00:59:58,852 --> 01:00:00,602
You're walking too fast.

01:00:50,257 --> 01:00:51,499

1264
01:00:51,629 --> 01:00:54,129

1265

1266

<i>With handy peel, you just
rub, peel, and scrub.</i>

1268
01:01:02,686 --> 01:01:04,569
I don't wanna
watch this anymore.

1269
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,013
Where's the iPad?

1270
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:07,303
Sold.

1271
01:01:07,725 --> 01:01:08,499
What?

1272
01:01:09,396 --> 01:01:10,396
I had to sell it.

1273
01:01:12,564 --> 01:01:13,322
Why?

1274
01:01:14,573 --> 01:01:16,862
Whatever, Moonee,
this room costs money.

1275
01:01:19,346 --> 01:01:20,885
You know I like pepperoni.

1276
01:01:20,956 --> 01:01:22,464
Pepperoni costs money.

1277
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:27,714
Don't wipe that on the sheets.

1278
01:01:27,964 --> 01:01:29,393
Gotta sleep there.

1279
01:01:29,643 --> 01:01:31,049
This is my pillow.

1280
01:01:31,127 --> 01:01:33,111
I can wipe my
hands on my pillow.

1281
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,096
Are you gonna wash it, then?

1282
01:01:40,361 --> 01:01:42,307
I'll have Bertha wash it.

1283
01:01:42,692 --> 01:01:44,692
I'm not gonna
explain it to you again.

1284
01:01:45,457 --> 01:01:47,160
I'm ain't gonna let
you or anyone else

1285
01:01:47,185 --> 01:01:48,707
establish residency.

1286
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:51,056
Don't think I think

1287
01:01:51,081 --> 01:01:52,737
you're as dumb as
you want me to think.

1288
01:01:53,737 --> 01:01:55,244
You're gonna screw me over.

1289
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:58,096
You don't wanna do this?

1290
01:01:58,252 --> 01:02:00,276
You can go.
I'm serious.

1291
01:02:01,421 --> 01:02:03,835
Well, who's gonna know
if we even did this?

1292
01:02:11,204 --> 01:02:13,055
And I'm being straight with you.

1293
01:02:13,775 --> 01:02:15,978
Gotta settle up by Friday.

1294
01:02:41,997 --> 01:02:43,231
Come on.

1295
01:02:54,477 --> 01:02:55,493
Hey, April.

1296
01:02:59,392 --> 01:03:00,446
Come on, Moonee.

1297
01:03:01,368 --> 01:03:04,269
- What are you taking pictures for?
- New policy.

1298
01:03:04,294 --> 01:03:06,863
Narek wants me to
document the vacancy.

1299
01:03:07,153 --> 01:03:08,286
Moonee, come on.

1300
01:03:17,042 --> 01:03:18,401
Goodnight, ladies.

1301
01:03:18,565 --> 01:03:20,206
See you in 24 hours.

1302
01:03:31,038 --> 01:03:33,749
I'm right across 192
at the Magic Castle.

1303
01:03:33,796 --> 01:03:36,015
I come here once a month,
and the rate's thirty five.

1304
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:38,677
Yes, well, our policy has changed.

1305
01:03:38,763 --> 01:03:40,278
You can't just changed the policy.

1306
01:03:40,325 --> 01:03:41,700
I certainly can.

1307
01:03:41,804 --> 01:03:43,140
Fuck this right now.

1308
01:03:43,304 --> 01:03:44,382
What are you doing?

1309
01:03:44,476 --> 01:03:46,187
Don't worry about me.

1310
01:03:46,296 --> 01:03:47,773
- Who are you calling?
- Mind your business.

1311
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:50,085
- Can't you see I'm in charge here?
- I don't care.

1312
01:03:51,538 --> 01:03:52,647
<i>Hello. Bobby.</i>

1313
01:03:52,718 --> 01:03:55,788
Hey, Bobby.
These fuckos...

1314
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:57,632
at the Arabian...

1315
01:03:57,724 --> 01:03:59,764
are trying to charge me...

1316
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:01,331
Forty five.

1317
01:04:01,557 --> 01:04:02,995
Forty five bucks!

1318
01:04:03,081 --> 01:04:04,917
Can you tell them
it's thirty five?

1319
01:04:05,112 --> 01:04:06,386
<i>I know how much Narek...</i>

1320
01:04:06,456 --> 01:04:07,542
Hey, listen, Bobby?

1321
01:04:07,589 --> 01:04:09,229
<i>Where's Jimmy?</i>
It's me, Jimmy, Bobby.

1322
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:10,942
We're not honoring
the deal anymore.

1323
01:04:10,967 --> 01:04:12,380
Hey, Jimmy, how's it going?

1324
01:04:12,528 --> 01:04:14,325
- Hello?
<i>- Who's this?</i>

1325
01:04:14,398 --> 01:04:16,538
Any arrangements or deals
you have with the previous owner--

1326
01:04:16,812 --> 01:04:19,249
- Give us a break, lady!
- Is no longer honored or recognized.

1327
01:04:19,281 --> 01:04:20,359
Thank you.

1328
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:37,343
We've had an agreement
in place for a while

1329
01:04:37,412 --> 01:04:40,732
where we give a little break
to each others--

1330
01:04:40,788 --> 01:04:44,109
I'm well aware of the
arrangement you used to have.

1331
01:04:44,272 --> 01:04:46,327
But as I've said five times now...

1332
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,077
this is no longer being honored.

1333
01:04:48,171 --> 01:04:50,827
I just went through this whole
thing with the Enchanted Inn.

1334
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:53,835
Look.

1335
01:04:54,121 --> 01:04:56,536
- Can't you make an exception?
- No.

1336
01:04:57,161 --> 01:04:59,091
This is not up for discussion.

1337
01:04:59,278 --> 01:05:00,927
You see what I'm saying, Bobby?

1338
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:01,878
Ugh!

1339
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:04,903
Duh, lady, duh!

1340
01:05:09,546 --> 01:05:11,874
Magic Castle discount,
there you go.

1341
01:05:11,997 --> 01:05:13,482
- Excuse me...
- Aw, you're so sweet, Bobby.

1342
01:05:13,538 --> 01:05:14,976
We won't take your business.

1343
01:05:15,062 --> 01:05:16,333
Please take your money.

1344
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:17,107
What?

1345
01:05:17,162 --> 01:05:19,480
All of you kindly leave, please.
Thank you.

1346
01:05:19,505 --> 01:05:20,856
You can't do that.

1347
01:05:21,067 --> 01:05:22,918
I have the forty five.
Are you fucking serious?

1348
01:05:23,817 --> 01:05:25,676
Listen to you and your child.

1349
01:05:25,911 --> 01:05:28,106
No wonder
you're in this situation.

1350
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,793
Please leave the property!

1351
01:05:29,879 --> 01:05:31,231
Right now, leave.

1352
01:05:35,305 --> 01:05:37,250
- Hey, hey, come on.
- What is wrong with you?

1353
01:05:37,325 --> 01:05:39,919
Are you crazy?
Out your mind?

1354
01:05:40,585 --> 01:05:43,483
You better come back here
and clean this up. Back here!

1355
01:05:43,705 --> 01:05:44,900
Fuck you.

1356
01:05:45,463 --> 01:05:47,252
Do not ever come back...

1357
01:06:10,656 --> 01:06:14,312
Damn, girl, this shit looks
fancy in here.

1358
01:06:14,487 --> 01:06:15,487
Thank you, thank you.

1359
01:06:15,526 --> 01:06:16,424
Yah, you got it like that.

1360
01:06:16,449 --> 01:06:18,894
You and interior decorator
some shit?

1361
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:21,310
Shit is mad cozy.

1362
01:06:22,122 --> 01:06:23,638
Guys, you want cheesies?

1363
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:24,567
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1364
01:06:24,622 --> 01:06:25,958
What's that big thing over there?

1365
01:06:25,997 --> 01:06:27,489
That's a turkey roaster.

1366
01:06:27,544 --> 01:06:29,544
The fuck, is it
Thanksgiving up here?

1367
01:06:29,591 --> 01:06:31,935
You got some cranberry
sauce too? Shit.

1368
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,497
I make some things, but...

1369
01:06:33,749 --> 01:06:35,991
Lunchables are like
one dollar, you know?

1370
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:37,897
Gramma, can they sleep over
here every night?

1371
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:40,326
- I don't know about that.
- Yeah, you tryin' to cook us dinner.

1372
01:06:40,365 --> 01:06:42,006
Oh, I don't know about
every night.

1373
01:06:42,053 --> 01:06:43,131
Why not?

1374
01:06:43,155 --> 01:06:44,599
We could sleep
together like a big

1375
01:06:44,624 --> 01:06:45,748
- family!
- Yeah!

1376
01:06:45,773 --> 01:06:47,843
I'll pull out a mattress on the
floor, somethin' like that.

1377
01:06:47,883 --> 01:06:49,093
But ya'll ain't
sleepin' in my bed.

1378
01:06:49,242 --> 01:06:51,211
- No, you sleep on this side.
- Aren't you happy?

1379
01:06:51,304 --> 01:06:53,484
I'll sleep-sleep on that side.

1380
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:56,195
This is gonna be the
funniest sleepover ever.

1381
01:06:56,288 --> 01:06:57,303
Yeah!

1382
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:58,350
Since it's bedtime,

1383
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:00,764
can we finally go fucking
smoke a blunt outside?

1384
01:07:28,818 --> 01:07:29,912
Can you tie me up?

1385
01:07:31,162 --> 01:07:33,084
Where we going, swimming?

1386
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,482
No, we're gonna take
swimsuit selfies.

1387
01:07:35,576 --> 01:07:37,123
Swimsuit selfies!

1388
01:07:37,248 --> 01:07:38,060
Aaah!

1389
01:07:38,756 --> 01:07:39,967

01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:00,563
Hey!

1422
01:09:00,876 --> 01:09:01,493
Ugh.

1427
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:17,904
Sorry to interrupt.

1428
01:09:18,818 --> 01:09:22,357
I just wanted to pay you
for the week, sir.

1429
01:09:22,888 --> 01:09:24,677
- It's good.
- Duh.

1430
01:09:40,281 --> 01:09:42,734
You spit a little bit out.

1431
01:09:50,505 --> 01:09:51,544
Hi, Bobby!

1432
01:09:51,685 --> 01:09:53,263
Hi, bossy guy!

1433
01:09:54,419 --> 01:09:55,724
Good kids.

01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:57,250
Mostly.

1435
01:10:01,027 --> 01:10:02,221

- This is all fineable.
- What?

1439
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:10,563
These bikes blocking the walkway.

1440
01:10:10,588 --> 01:10:11,899
Oh, okay. Okay.

1441
01:10:12,027 --> 01:10:13,956
You have to make
a flyer, all right?

1442
01:10:14,096 --> 01:10:16,174
It has to say, "Please
move your bikes

1443
01:10:16,229 --> 01:10:17,409
and lock them in the back."

1444
01:10:17,565 --> 01:10:19,017
- Okay, uh, in the...
- Okay?

1445
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:20,237

01:18:49,278 --> 01:18:50,309
Thanks.

1595
01:18:51,137 --> 01:18:52,738
Give him the bands, Moon.

1596
01:18:53,137 --> 01:18:54,621
Give the man the bands.

1597
01:18:54,809 --> 01:18:56,668
- Have a great time.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

1598
01:18:56,893 --> 01:18:58,510
Thank you.
Come on, baby.

1599
01:18:59,117 --> 01:19:00,516
Whoo!

1600
01:19:00,586 --> 01:19:02,063
Lul-lul-lul-lul-lul

1601
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:03,391
Aaah!

1602
01:19:04,563 --> 01:19:05,844
Oh, my God.

1603
01:19:07,739 --> 01:19:09,833
- That one's beautiful.
- I want that one.

1604
01:19:10,567 --> 01:19:11,325
Hunh!

1605
01:19:11,442 --> 01:19:13,153
Get a fancy one.

1606
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:14,684
Let's buy it, give me that.

1607
01:19:14,733 --> 01:19:15,991
- Look at what else they have.
- Hey!

1608
01:19:16,093 --> 01:19:17,272
Cotton balls?

1609
01:19:17,303 --> 01:19:18,819
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1610
01:19:18,975 --> 01:19:20,366
Toys!

1611
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:21,819
Seriously, girlfriend?

1612
01:19:23,002 --> 01:19:23,842
Money!

1613
01:19:23,873 --> 01:19:25,507
- I'm rich.
- You got money.

1614
01:19:25,554 --> 01:19:26,421
I'm rich.

1615
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:27,478
Whoo!

1616
01:19:27,526 --> 01:19:28,971
- Whoo!
- Aaah!

1617
01:19:29,104 --> 01:19:32,729
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's American flag ♪

1618
01:19:32,815 --> 01:19:34,495
Hunh! Look, there's a flute.

1619
01:19:47,887 --> 01:19:49,333
Back in the workforce?

1620
01:19:49,442 --> 01:19:50,528
Say what?

1621
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:53,122
- New job?
- Yeah.

1622
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:55,379
Interesting hours.

1623
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:56,668
What?

1624
01:19:58,018 --> 01:19:59,057
One...

1625
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:03,235
I see you dressed in PJ's
all day, every day.

1626
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:05,896
- Am I wearing PJ's now?
- Two...

1627
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,303
If you're workin'...

1628
01:20:07,475 --> 01:20:08,928
who's lookin' after Moonee?

1629
01:20:10,225 --> 01:20:12,568
Mind your own business, bro.

1630
01:20:12,857 --> 01:20:15,107
Get that stolen cart
off the property.

1631
01:20:19,396 --> 01:20:21,107
<i>Doesn't hold the curl?</i>

1632
01:20:21,185 --> 01:20:24,177
<i>Wish you had celebrity hair
without paying celebrity prices?</i>

1633
01:20:24,266 --> 01:20:25,423
Yeah?

1634
01:20:25,474 --> 01:20:27,287
<i> Celebrity Curls.</i>

1635
01:20:27,797 --> 01:20:28,915
Who is it?

1636
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:32,851
<i>Simply insert the
Celebrity Curl wand</i>

1637
01:20:32,876 --> 01:20:35,313
<i>through the curling strip.
Hook a section of hair</i>

1638
01:20:35,389 --> 01:20:39,155
Go away, asshole
or I'm gonna call the cops!

1639
01:20:40,272 --> 01:20:41,741
Why you calling the cops?

1640
01:20:45,936 --> 01:20:47,303
I'm not going away!

1641
01:20:49,084 --> 01:20:50,475
Mom, who's outside?

1642
01:20:50,571 --> 01:20:52,195
Nobody, baby, don't worry about it.

1643
01:20:58,109 --> 01:20:59,351
Hey! Hey!

1644
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:00,820
Hey, what's going on?

1645
01:21:00,929 --> 01:21:03,164
- None of your business, bro.
- It <i>is</i> my business.

1646
01:21:03,343 --> 01:21:05,023
I'm the manager here.
What's goin' on?

1647
01:21:05,078 --> 01:21:05,929
Okay, yeah.

1648
01:21:06,058 --> 01:21:08,066
The girl in there, she's got
somethin' of mine. I-I...

1649
01:21:08,105 --> 01:21:09,152
I want it back.

1650
01:21:09,177 --> 01:21:10,542
The six-year-old?

1651
01:21:11,028 --> 01:21:12,528
No, man. The mom.

1652
01:21:17,551 --> 01:21:18,528
Halley.

1653
01:21:18,681 --> 01:21:21,126
It's Bobby, we got
a situation here. Open up.

1654
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:25,462
Yeah.

1655
01:21:25,886 --> 01:21:28,230
This guy says
you have something of his.

1656
01:21:28,487 --> 01:21:30,065
I don't know who this guy is.

1657
01:21:30,339 --> 01:21:33,057
She doesn't know who you are.
You got the wrong girl.

1658
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:34,448
We gonna talk now.

1659
01:21:34,862 --> 01:21:37,760
You know, you gotta leave the
premises if you're not staying here.

1660
01:21:38,042 --> 01:21:40,393
I'm not going anywhere without
my four Magic Bands, okay?

1661
01:21:40,472 --> 01:21:43,261
She went in my bag, she took
four fucking magic bands.

1662
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,260
What the fuck is a magical band?

1663
01:21:46,331 --> 01:21:47,963
I don't know what
this guy's talking about.

1664
01:21:48,017 --> 01:21:49,518
She don't know
what you're talking about.

1665
01:21:49,674 --> 01:21:51,798
She went in my stuff,
she lifted four fucking bands.

1666
01:21:51,854 --> 01:21:52,907
- I don't know what
- She don't know...

1667
01:21:52,932 --> 01:21:54,307
- you're talking about!
- What are you talkin'...

1668
01:21:54,377 --> 01:21:55,862
You do know what
I'm talking about!

1669
01:21:55,956 --> 01:21:56,908
Okay, I want 'em back now.

1670
01:21:56,933 --> 01:21:58,924
That's $1700, that's
grand larceny, bitch.

1671
01:21:58,971 --> 01:22:00,112
Hey, hey, hey, buddy.

1672
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:03,272
I-I'm happy to call
the cops right now

1673
01:22:03,297 --> 01:22:04,780
and we can fill out a report.

1674
01:22:05,335 --> 01:22:08,803
And you can tell 'em what your
business was on the premises.

1675
01:22:09,488 --> 01:22:10,699
Four bracelets?

1676
01:22:11,785 --> 01:22:15,144
I imagine they were for your
wife and children, yeah?

1677
01:22:20,092 --> 01:22:23,584
I suggest you
leave the premises right now.

1678
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:31,823
This isn't a premises,
it's a fuckin' dump.

1679
01:22:32,143 --> 01:22:34,518
'Bout time you
make yourself useful.

1680
01:22:40,506 --> 01:22:42,232
Did he have to pee again?

1681
01:22:42,326 --> 01:22:43,842
Don't worry about it, Moonee.

1682
01:22:59,942 --> 01:23:00,989
What now?!

1683
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:02,535
From now on, all visitors

1684
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,809
are required to check
in at the front desk.

1685
01:23:04,834 --> 01:23:06,389
- Got it?
- What?

1686
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:07,654
You have a guest?

1687
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:10,186
They check in with me
at the front office.

1688
01:23:10,295 --> 01:23:12,334
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1689
01:23:12,365 --> 01:23:13,256
You heard me.

1690
01:23:13,318 --> 01:23:14,850
Get back inside, Moonee.

1691
01:23:14,928 --> 01:23:17,412
When I say register,
I'm talkin' about ID.

1692
01:23:17,483 --> 01:23:20,129
They gotta leave the ID
right there with me in the office.

1693
01:23:20,163 --> 01:23:22,217
You can't just
not let me have guests.

1694
01:23:22,272 --> 01:23:23,679
What gives you the authority?

1695
01:23:23,804 --> 01:23:25,163
Uh, what, the authority?

1696
01:23:25,218 --> 01:23:27,343
Uh, my job title. Manager.

1697
01:23:27,561 --> 01:23:29,084
- I have friends, though!
- Hey,

1698
01:23:29,147 --> 01:23:30,912
- I have a lot of friends.
- Watch those glasses on the walkway.

1699
01:23:30,959 --> 01:23:32,912
Yeah, we all got friends,
we all got friends.

1700
01:23:33,033 --> 01:23:36,017
But this is a special rule for you.

1701
01:23:37,188 --> 01:23:38,422
Okay, but Bobby...

1702
01:23:38,603 --> 01:23:40,181
- I do follow rules.
- Gotta start to respect people.

1703
01:23:40,206 --> 01:23:42,284
Just 'cause they're not your
rules doesn't mean anything.

1704
01:23:42,439 --> 01:23:44,704
No, they-they-they're
the company's rules.

1705
01:23:44,751 --> 01:23:46,947
They're the motel's rules.
That's the way it is.

1706
01:23:46,972 --> 01:23:48,767
- Fuck you looking at, Tina.
- I'm a very fair person. Hey.

1707
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:50,651
- No, listen...
- Hey, people are living...

1708
01:23:50,698 --> 01:23:52,917
You're not my fucking father.

1709
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:54,151
I don't wanna be your father.

1710
01:23:54,176 --> 01:23:55,870
You can't fucking
treat me like this.

1711
01:23:55,957 --> 01:23:58,855
- This isn't a fucking jail!
- Uh, listen. Hey, calm, calm down!

1712
01:23:58,887 --> 01:24:00,401
- Calm down!
- This isn't a jail!

1713
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:02,449
- No, no, it's a place where people live.
- You're just gonna take my friends away?

1714
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:05,128
- And you gotta, you gotta calm down!
- That's fucking invasion of privacy.

1715
01:24:05,168 --> 01:24:06,222
- It's like the fucking
- I've had it.

1716
01:24:06,247 --> 01:24:07,433
- Fifth Amendment or something.
- I've had it!

1717
01:24:07,495 --> 01:24:09,143
- You can't fucking do that.
- That's it! That's it!

1718
01:24:09,215 --> 01:24:10,269
- Who do you think you are?
- That's it!

1719
01:24:10,294 --> 01:24:11,675
Bobby Big Shot?!

1720
01:24:12,683 --> 01:24:14,769
Fuck you, Bobby!

1721
01:24:14,894 --> 01:24:17,890
- I don't have to listen to you.
- Out!

1722
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,953
I want you out of this lobby!

1723
01:24:20,992 --> 01:24:22,328
I'm gonna count to three.

1724
01:24:22,359 --> 01:24:24,117
And if you don't
leave this lobby.

1725
01:24:24,594 --> 01:24:26,125
You're outta here tonight.

1726
01:24:27,305 --> 01:24:28,282
One!

1727
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:30,485
Two!

1728
01:24:32,383 --> 01:24:33,204
Three!

1729
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,018
Oh!

1730
01:24:40,152 --> 01:24:41,238
Nice!

1731
01:24:42,781 --> 01:24:45,289
Moonee, why'd you take
me on this adventure?

1732
01:24:45,344 --> 01:24:47,711
I didn't know
it was going to rain!

1733
01:24:47,755 --> 01:24:49,747
Did you not even watch the news?

1734
01:24:49,802 --> 01:24:52,849
I never watch the news.
It's so boring!

1735
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,508
I watch the news,
it's not that boring.

1736
01:25:18,831 --> 01:25:19,714
Whoa.

1737
01:25:20,537 --> 01:25:21,842
That was pooey.

1738
01:25:23,342 --> 01:25:25,615
See! I took you on a safari.

1739
01:25:26,037 --> 01:25:27,162
Mm-hmm.

1740
01:25:47,761 --> 01:25:48,565
Hi.

1741
01:25:49,321 --> 01:25:50,486
These two are still busted.

1742
01:25:50,542 --> 01:25:52,721
But I'll be done with
that one in like two minutes.

1743
01:25:55,464 --> 01:25:56,581
Okay.

1744
01:26:19,421 --> 01:26:21,070
Mom, it's Halley.

1745
01:26:28,185 --> 01:26:29,201
- Hey.
- What?

1746
01:26:33,256 --> 01:26:35,615
I know Moonee probably
did some shit.

1747
01:26:35,795 --> 01:26:37,553
And I'm sorry about that.

1748
01:26:39,053 --> 01:26:42,061
But I don't think that shit
should, you know...

1749
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:44,811
affect us, you know,
they're kids.

1750
01:26:45,748 --> 01:26:46,795
Is that it?

1751
01:26:48,607 --> 01:26:49,888
Yeah, well...

1752
01:26:51,302 --> 01:26:53,395
Could you spot me
my rent this week?

1753
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:54,661
I'm assed out.

1754
01:26:55,818 --> 01:26:56,693
What?

1755
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:01,373
I think you got that covered.

1756
01:27:01,838 --> 01:27:03,236
What are you talking about?

1757
01:27:04,572 --> 01:27:07,111
You don't think everybody
knows what's up, Halley?

1758
01:27:07,174 --> 01:27:09,588
Like...
everybody.

1759
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:12,119
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1760
01:27:13,049 --> 01:27:14,119
Bitch.

1761
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:19,424
<i>Seems pretty clear to me.</i>

1762
01:27:19,596 --> 01:27:21,260
<i>Step aside, soldier!</i>

1763
01:27:22,958 --> 01:27:24,122
That's you.

1764
01:27:24,444 --> 01:27:25,803
That's not me.

1765
01:27:29,321 --> 01:27:31,219
Those are your tats, bitch.

1766
01:27:31,244 --> 01:27:33,157
Are you fucking kidding me?

1767
01:27:33,725 --> 01:27:35,483
And I swear to God...

1768
01:27:35,678 --> 01:27:39,163
if Scooty was ever in the room
while you were whoring off...

1769
01:27:39,213 --> 01:27:40,861
I'll fucking kill you.

1770
01:27:44,135 --> 01:27:45,947
- Fuck you, bitch!
- No!

1771
01:27:45,972 --> 01:27:46,885
The fuck outta here!

1772
01:28:03,082 --> 01:28:05,324
Mom, are you okay?

1773
01:28:08,826 --> 01:28:09,959
Mom?

1774
01:28:14,515 --> 01:28:16,867
Uh... are you okay, Mom?

1775
01:28:25,161 --> 01:28:27,615
You're not gonna like it.
Because guess what?

1776
01:28:27,693 --> 01:28:30,021
- What?
- No fun stuff in the class.

1777
01:28:30,504 --> 01:28:33,269
I heard in school,
you get recess.

1778
01:28:33,395 --> 01:28:35,566
And recess is fun,
you get to go outside,

1779
01:28:35,605 --> 01:28:36,855
you get on the playground.

1780
01:28:36,902 --> 01:28:39,348
- It's fun.
- I-It's just recess!

1781
01:28:39,621 --> 01:28:41,223
Nothing else!

1782
01:28:57,539 --> 01:29:00,055
Well, my grandma sometimes
does that to me

1783
01:29:00,133 --> 01:29:02,273
but I trick her
that I fall asleep.

1784
01:29:02,468 --> 01:29:03,866
But then I just wake up...

1785
01:29:03,891 --> 01:29:06,296
I think something's
happening at my room.

1786
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:11,716
Did Ashley fucking
call DCF on me?

1787
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:13,779
Ma'am we got a call, and it
doesn't matter who the person...

1788
01:29:13,888 --> 01:29:14,998
From who?

1789
01:29:15,138 --> 01:29:16,560
Who the fuck called you guys?

1790
01:29:16,607 --> 01:29:18,122
Who called you?

1791
01:29:18,161 --> 01:29:19,270
Halley, we're required
to investigate...

1792
01:29:19,348 --> 01:29:21,480
You fucking tell me who
called and I'll tell you why.

1793
01:29:22,153 --> 01:29:24,708
If it was Ashley, she's hating
'cause I fucking beat her ass.

1794
01:29:24,733 --> 01:29:25,396
Girls.

1795
01:29:25,475 --> 01:29:26,670
You're getting into fights?

1796
01:29:27,521 --> 01:29:28,810
Don't fucking touch me.

1797
01:29:30,646 --> 01:29:31,826
You should uh...

1798
01:29:33,732 --> 01:29:34,864
You wait right here, okay?

1799
01:29:34,889 --> 01:29:36,568
Why is my mom yelling?

1800
01:29:36,842 --> 01:29:38,944
Uh, she's just talking
to these ladies.

1801
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:40,076
Jancey, you go home.

1802
01:29:40,194 --> 01:29:41,084
- You go home now.
- Okay.

1803
01:29:41,147 --> 01:29:42,280
- Okay.
- Bye, Moonee.

1804
01:29:42,897 --> 01:29:44,514
You're not coming in
to my fucking place.

1805
01:29:45,201 --> 01:29:46,983
I'm not doing anything wrong.

1806
01:29:47,013 --> 01:29:49,107
You're literally coming on
to my fucking property.

1807
01:29:49,162 --> 01:29:50,443
You're not coming into my room.

1808
01:29:50,685 --> 01:29:52,170
You don't have
a fucking court order.

1809
01:29:52,302 --> 01:29:53,318
Let me see paperwork.

1810
01:29:53,356 --> 01:29:54,364
So then can you help us?

1811
01:29:54,982 --> 01:29:56,381
Can I help you about what?

1812
01:29:56,631 --> 01:29:58,201
Why is my mom upset?

1813
01:29:58,498 --> 01:30:00,357
You know, I don't know, but uh.

1814
01:30:00,468 --> 01:30:02,507
They're just talkin', they
gotta figure something out.

1815
01:30:02,662 --> 01:30:03,599
What are--

1816
01:30:03,624 --> 01:30:06,310
What do they have to
figure anything out with?

1817
01:30:06,436 --> 01:30:09,897
Um, I don't know. It's
some sort of confusion.

1818
01:30:09,929 --> 01:30:11,952
But it'll be fine. Okay?

1819
01:30:12,530 --> 01:30:13,460
Mom!

1820
01:30:14,769 --> 01:30:16,691
You're doing this in
front of my fucking kid.

1821
01:30:27,884 --> 01:30:29,829
Can I go back to my room now?

1822
01:30:30,427 --> 01:30:31,661
In a little bit.

1823
01:30:32,391 --> 01:30:33,797
- Couple of minutes, okay?
- Yeah.

1824
01:30:36,789 --> 01:30:39,477
Just, just, eh, Moonee.

1825
01:30:40,637 --> 01:30:41,887
Talk to the lady.

1826
01:30:42,606 --> 01:30:44,091
She's just got some
questions for you.

1827
01:30:44,116 --> 01:30:45,516
Then you can go
back to your room.

1828
01:30:45,883 --> 01:30:46,774
All right?

1829
01:30:47,801 --> 01:30:50,207
Can you tell me what kind of
stuff you do everyday, Moonee?

1830
01:30:55,689 --> 01:30:57,275
Do you ever go
swimming in the pool?

1831
01:31:02,014 --> 01:31:02,968
What about...

1832
01:31:03,038 --> 01:31:04,764
What kind of stuff do you
like to do with your friends?

1833
01:31:11,346 --> 01:31:13,580
<i>I wish that you could
just be me for one day.</i>

1834
01:31:13,831 --> 01:31:16,018
<i>Oh, I wish that you could
be me for one day.</i>

1835
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:17,783
<i>- I wish it.
- I wish it.</i>

1836
01:31:25,245 --> 01:31:28,487
<i>Oh, god, why does my mouth
suddenly taste like bubble gum?</i>

1837
01:31:28,982 --> 01:31:30,209
<i>Warren?</i>

1838
01:31:31,396 --> 01:31:33,842
<i>It's me, it's Greg.</i>

1839
01:31:35,271 --> 01:31:37,884
<i>It's Warren, I'm in Greg's body.</i>

1840
01:31:38,087 --> 01:31:39,931
<i>And I'm in Warren's body.</i>

1841
01:32:00,021 --> 01:32:01,411
What's going on?

1842
01:32:02,846 --> 01:32:04,682
Nothing baby, go back to bed.

1843
01:32:52,133 --> 01:32:54,125
What you doing all wet, Mom?

1844
01:32:54,813 --> 01:32:55,750
Nothing.

1845
01:33:01,115 --> 01:33:02,177
Come here.

1846
01:33:13,753 --> 01:33:14,894
Tag, you're it.

1847
01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:18,801
It's very good.

1848
01:33:21,129 --> 01:33:22,403
Tickle monster!

1849
01:33:22,574 --> 01:33:24,254
I'm gonna tickle the monster.

1850
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:39,122
Is there any baskets over there
that are less than half full?

1851
01:33:39,216 --> 01:33:41,357
Throw them out, okay?

1852
01:33:41,755 --> 01:33:43,036
Yeah, yeah.

1853
01:33:44,482 --> 01:33:45,505
Ooh-ooh!

1854
01:33:46,321 --> 01:33:47,423
Ooh-ooh!

1855
01:33:47,571 --> 01:33:49,391
Girl, those are from the outside.

1856
01:33:49,492 --> 01:33:52,321
Your grubby little fingers
trying to unlock this window.

1857
01:33:53,398 --> 01:33:55,054
You better clean that.

1858
01:34:01,683 --> 01:34:03,364
Don't do that, don't do that.

1859
01:34:03,450 --> 01:34:06,215
If DCF has a fucking problem
with that, eff them.

1860
01:34:08,973 --> 01:34:10,278
Throw you these.

1861
01:34:12,001 --> 01:34:13,931
You better clean up
those underpants.

1862
01:34:14,903 --> 01:34:16,036
Thank you.

1863
01:34:22,169 --> 01:34:22,982
Hey.

1864
01:34:23,584 --> 01:34:24,904
- Hey.
- What's up?

1865
01:34:24,929 --> 01:34:27,412
- You need towel?
- No.

1866
01:34:29,564 --> 01:34:30,980
Sometime a little bit.

1867
01:34:31,005 --> 01:34:32,520
I have a present for you.

1868
01:34:33,064 --> 01:34:35,291
This is for you, but make
sure you smoke all of it.

1869
01:34:35,666 --> 01:34:37,968
- Like all of it.
- Yes.

1870
01:34:38,859 --> 01:34:40,555
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1871
01:34:41,999 --> 01:34:43,594
Enjoy that shit for me.

1872
01:34:44,155 --> 01:34:45,358
Thank you, hey.

1873
01:34:46,882 --> 01:34:47,968
And don't worry.

1874
01:34:48,288 --> 01:34:49,397
It's gonna be okay.

1875
01:34:50,482 --> 01:34:52,084

Halley, these DCF officers are
here in regards to Moonee.

01:39:38,897 --> 01:39:40,827
Do you wanna inspect my room?
Be my guest.

1936
01:39:44,322 --> 01:39:45,908
You wanna shake my boxes?

1937
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:48,009
You wanna look inside my fridge?

1939
01:39:54,525 --> 01:39:55,212

01:39:59,252 --> 01:40:02,205
Why don't you take
Moonee outside, so

1943
01:40:02,356 --> 01:40:03,817
we can talk to Halley privately.

1944
01:40:04,652 --> 01:40:05,699
What's going on?

1945
01:40:06,582 --> 01:40:07,262
Um.

1946
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:09,863
Well, you know what?

1947
01:40:10,035 --> 01:40:12,324
We just wanna make sure
that you're safe. Okay?

1948
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:15,246
We've also obtained this
online classified ad

1949
01:40:15,309 --> 01:40:17,559
soliciting customers
for sexual activities

1950
01:40:17,584 --> 01:40:19,156
with your phone number attached.

1951
01:40:19,195 --> 01:40:20,883
Well, you're gonna go
somewhere really fun

1952
01:40:20,923 --> 01:40:22,492
and we're gonna have toys.

1953
01:40:22,718 --> 01:40:24,264
For how many days?

1954
01:40:24,413 --> 01:40:26,422
It will only be temporary, okay?

1955
01:40:26,541 --> 01:40:27,736
What's 'temporary'?

1956
01:40:27,861 --> 01:40:30,454
Temporary means just for
a little bit of time.

1957
01:40:30,783 --> 01:40:31,916
Can we do that?

1958
01:40:33,412 --> 01:40:34,365
I guess so.

1959
01:40:34,459 --> 01:40:35,834
Okay. Thank you.

1960
01:40:35,889 --> 01:40:37,889
You're such a big girl,
you know that?

1961
01:40:38,398 --> 01:40:39,179
No.

1962
01:40:39,265 --> 01:40:40,257
That's able to take her.

1963
01:40:40,327 --> 01:40:42,139
But luckily, we have a
family in Polk County

1964
01:40:42,178 --> 01:40:43,303
that can take her
for the entire course

1965
01:40:43,328 --> 01:40:45,062
of the investigation, okay?

1966
01:40:45,132 --> 01:40:47,374
Could I say goodbye
to my friend Scooty?

1967
01:40:47,812 --> 01:40:48,773
Uh...

1968
01:40:49,163 --> 01:40:50,858
He's down in 223.

1969
01:40:51,038 --> 01:40:53,288
We just need to check
to see if that's okay.

1970
01:40:53,522 --> 01:40:56,194
She wants to say goodbye
to her friend Scooty.

1971
01:40:56,389 --> 01:40:57,835
It's okay for her
to say goodbye, right?

1972
01:40:57,913 --> 01:40:59,163
I'll take her down.

1973
01:40:59,335 --> 01:41:00,850
We don't say goodbye.

1974
01:41:01,163 --> 01:41:02,842
But you can give
your friend a hug.

1975
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:05,349
And you'll see them real soon.

1976
01:41:05,451 --> 01:41:06,372
Okay?

1977
01:41:06,552 --> 01:41:08,529
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go.

1978
01:41:09,006 --> 01:41:10,404
My colleague's gonna
take Moonee downstairs

1979
01:41:10,429 --> 01:41:11,583
to say goodbye to her friend.

1980
01:41:11,608 --> 01:41:12,576
And in the meantime,
it would be great

1981
01:41:12,601 --> 01:41:14,389
if you could pack a
bag with necessities.

1982
01:41:14,414 --> 01:41:16,436
Also, maybe a favorite
doll or a toy.

1983
01:41:48,309 --> 01:41:49,106
Yes.

1984
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:52,254
Hello, Miss, my name is
Susan Watson, I'm with DCF.

1985
01:41:52,793 --> 01:41:54,285
We have a quick
favor to ask you.

1986
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:56,434
Ashley, what happened
to your face?

1987
01:42:06,827 --> 01:42:09,374
Okay, we can do a
hug or a high five.

1988
01:42:10,897 --> 01:42:12,350
Thank you so much.

1989
01:42:14,506 --> 01:42:15,991
I hope your eye feels better.

1990
01:42:16,045 --> 01:42:17,615
Thank you, baby.

1991
01:42:18,224 --> 01:42:20,662
All right.
Thank you so much.

1992
01:42:20,849 --> 01:42:23,005
My mom said you're going
to another family.

1993
01:42:23,099 --> 01:42:23,786
Scooty.

1994
01:42:23,811 --> 01:42:25,326
- What?
- Thank you.

1995
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:28,753
Why did he say I was
going to another family?

1996
01:42:28,778 --> 01:42:30,215
You're just gonna go
live with a family

1997
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:31,513
just for a little while.

1998
01:42:38,652 --> 01:42:39,878
Just temporary.

1999
01:42:39,903 --> 01:42:41,949
Moonee, we're going
to your room, okay?

2000
01:42:42,208 --> 01:42:43,075
Okay.

2001
01:42:45,745 --> 01:42:47,323
Watch the steps.

2002
01:42:54,145 --> 01:42:56,981
Are those cops going to
take my mom away?

2003
01:42:57,145 --> 01:42:58,121
No, they're not.

2004
01:42:58,224 --> 01:42:59,981
Are they going to take
me to another family?

2005
01:43:00,059 --> 01:43:02,145
I'm going to take you
to a nice family

2006
01:43:02,192 --> 01:43:04,309
where you're gonna be okay
just for a little while.

2007
01:43:04,356 --> 01:43:05,903
- Is that okay?
- Well, I don't want to.

2008
01:43:05,928 --> 01:43:07,193
- I don't want to go.
- Moonee.

2009
01:43:07,459 --> 01:43:08,608
- I don't want to go.
- I know.

2010
01:43:16,823 --> 01:43:18,198
- Moonee will you please go upstairs?
- Stop.

2011
01:43:18,253 --> 01:43:19,456
- Your mom knows all about it.
- Stop.

2012
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:21,065
Your mom said it was okay.

2013
01:43:34,077 --> 01:43:36,444
Do you want me to
get super angry?

2014
01:43:36,469 --> 01:43:37,631
No, I don't. That's why--

2015
01:43:38,428 --> 01:43:39,849
Hey, I-I'm gonna

2016
01:43:40,068 --> 01:43:42,279
fix those machines
by the end of the week.

2017
01:43:43,974 --> 01:43:44,896
Okay.

2018
01:43:47,338 --> 01:43:49,205
Would you please
go get her parent?

2019
01:43:49,268 --> 01:43:50,940
- Stop! Let go!
- Honey, honey!

2020
01:43:51,010 --> 01:43:52,448
She's gonna...
Calm down.

2021
01:43:53,916 --> 01:43:55,494
Halley, can you...

2022
01:43:56,268 --> 01:43:57,400
Sweetie, sweetie...

2023
01:43:57,479 --> 01:43:59,244
I'm not your sweetie.

2024
01:43:59,361 --> 01:44:01,041
She's being very
emotional right now.

2025
01:44:01,111 --> 01:44:02,330
What's goin' on?

2026
01:44:02,713 --> 01:44:05,854
You want me to help you
take my child away?

2027
01:44:05,963 --> 01:44:07,916
- I am so so--
- Are you retarded?

2028
01:44:07,941 --> 01:44:08,792
You're stupid, right?

2029
01:44:08,817 --> 01:44:09,895
- I don't have to go.
- Take a breath.

2030
01:44:09,973 --> 01:44:11,426
- Sweetie.
- Stop this.

2031
01:44:11,472 --> 01:44:13,176
Okay, you're literally asking me

2032
01:44:13,208 --> 01:44:15,731
to help you take away
my fucking kid!

2033
01:44:15,756 --> 01:44:17,147
- This is what's best right now.
- Halley, calm down.

2034
01:44:17,172 --> 01:44:18,864
Calm down? Calm down?

2035
01:44:18,903 --> 01:44:20,661
You want me to
fucking help, right?!

2036
01:44:20,708 --> 01:44:22,177
You want me to fucking help!

2037
01:44:22,202 --> 01:44:24,349
- Get the fuck out of my house!
- Hey, calm down!

2038
01:44:24,374 --> 01:44:26,731
Stop! You're such a liar!

2039
01:44:27,701 --> 01:44:29,151
You're such a liar!

2040
01:44:29,405 --> 01:44:31,374
You're a fucking--
Don't touch me!

2041
01:44:31,449 --> 01:44:32,902
- Stop!
- She just went to get your mom.

2042
01:44:32,927 --> 01:44:33,488
You.

2043
01:44:33,513 --> 01:44:34,129
You. Have.

2044
01:44:34,154 --> 01:44:34,840
You. Have. To.

2045
01:44:34,865 --> 01:44:35,590
You. Have. To. Stop!

2046
01:44:36,504 --> 01:44:37,754
I'm not going!

2047
01:44:39,418 --> 01:44:40,207
Here!

2048
01:44:40,426 --> 01:44:41,184
Moonee!

2049
01:44:42,332 --> 01:44:43,418
Shut the fuck up!

2050
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:44,161
Don't touch--

2051
01:44:46,145 --> 01:44:47,153
Moonee!

2052
01:44:48,421 --> 01:44:49,296
Moonee!

2053
01:44:49,671 --> 01:44:50,631
Oh, my God!

2054
01:44:50,811 --> 01:44:51,585
Officer!

2055
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:54,556
Fuck outta here!

2056
01:44:54,705 --> 01:44:56,689
Get the fuck outta here!

2057
01:45:00,103 --> 01:45:01,572
I don't care!

2058
01:45:01,616 --> 01:45:02,585
The child's running!

2059
01:45:07,376 --> 01:45:08,994
No! No, that way.

2060
01:45:10,228 --> 01:45:11,612
A-1, I got a child
running eastbound...

2061
01:45:11,744 --> 01:45:12,987
What's going on?

2062
01:45:13,049 --> 01:45:14,213
I don't know.

2063
01:45:24,334 --> 01:45:26,273
You let her just run away?!

2064
01:45:26,312 --> 01:45:27,390
Halley, will you please just--

2065
01:45:27,415 --> 01:45:29,415
And I'm the one who's unfit?

2066
01:45:31,057 --> 01:45:33,650
Fuck you!

2067
01:45:34,947 --> 01:45:35,846
Jancey!

2068
01:45:44,103 --> 01:45:45,134
Hi, Moonee.

2069
01:45:45,415 --> 01:45:46,853
Here you go, honey.

2070
01:45:46,954 --> 01:45:49,243
Jancey, come, honey,
it's time to eat.

2071
01:45:50,030 --> 01:45:52,624
We're just about to have lunch.
Are you hungry?

2072
01:45:52,649 --> 01:45:54,413
Moonee, you want a bowl, honey?

2073
01:46:00,654 --> 01:46:02,303
Moonee, what's wrong?

2074
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:05,366
Luci, por favor!

2075
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:06,381
Look at this.

2076
01:46:09,307 --> 01:46:10,198
Please?

2077
01:46:12,042 --> 01:46:13,713
You're scaring me, Moonee.

2078
01:46:13,758 --> 01:46:15,126
You're my best friend.

2079
01:46:15,219 --> 01:46:17,196
And this is maybe the only time

2080
01:46:17,235 --> 01:46:18,915
I'm going to see you again.

2081
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:20,235
What's going on?

2082
01:46:20,909 --> 01:46:22,870
Okay, just wait right here, okay?
Don't move.

2083
01:46:40,369 --> 01:46:41,322
This is--

2084
01:46:42,982 --> 01:46:45,083
I can't say it.

2085
01:46:52,403 --> 01:46:53,387
Bye.

2086
01:50:48,735 --> 01:50:53,570
