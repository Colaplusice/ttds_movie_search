Get on the ground now!
I need you on the ground!

3
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,855
Stay there!

4
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:37,723
Don't you move!

5
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,158
Get down!
Don't fucking move!

6

Let's go!

Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

8

Nobody move!

9
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,798
Nobody move!

10
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,501
Everybody, stay down!

11
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,203

I'm here. You're late.
I'm waiting on you again.

21
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,711
Hurry up.

22
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:56,047
Asshole!

23

24
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,820
Yeah.
You go, girl.

25
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,990
You know it, honey.

26

Next customer.

28
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,735
Oh, uh...

29
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,304
Can I take your order?

30
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,505
Uh...

31
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:58,076
I'll have, uh,
four black coffees, medium.

33
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,744
Name?
Baby.

34
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,012
"Baby"?

35
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,380
B-a-b-y, baby.

36
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,017
Could you pass that?

37
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,190
Baby.

38
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,395

44
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:49,995
I told you, no.

45
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:51,596
I can't deal
with you right now.

46
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,402
Be on time.

47
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,278
<i> It is believed</i>

49

What's his deal?

50
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:32,404
Baby?
Full cut, same as everyone.

51
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:36,241
No, doc,
i mean is he, uh, retarded?

52
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,977
"Retarded" means slow.
Was he slow?

53
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:39,644
No.

54
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,180
Then he don't sound
that retarded to me.

55
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,149
He's a good kid and
a devil behind the wheel.

56
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,850
What the hell else more
do you need to know?

57
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:49,287
So you don't think
that there's
something wrong with him

58
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,922
just not saying anything?

59
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,358
There's nothing wrong
with a little quiet.

60
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,527
You know why
they call him baby, right?

61
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,429
Still waiting on
his first words.

62
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,509
So, you're a mute, baby?
Is that what it is?

63
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,745
God.

64
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,347
Are you a mute?

65
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:16,348
No.

66
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:21,419
So, um,
what are you listening to?

67
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,554
Uh, music.

68
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:24,456
That's right.
You tell him, baby.

69
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,092
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

70
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,196
For god's sakes, griff,
leave the kid alone.

71
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:34,199
You can't just be
in crime, right?

72
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,667
Not without being
a little criminal.

73
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:39,437
I just want to find out
what's going on
between those ears,

74
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,773
aside, of course, from, uh...

75
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,109
<i> Egyptian reggae.</i>

76
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,176
What's it matter to you?

77
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:48,813
Just think that he thinks
he's better than us.

78
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,181
He wants to sit there
in his car

79
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,118
and keep
his white shirt clean
while the rest of us,

80
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,387
we roll in the dirt.

81
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,223
One of these days, baby,

82
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,891
you're gonna get
blood on your hands,

83
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,394
and you're gonna
find out that that shit

84
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,562
don't wash off
in the fucking sink.

85
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,898
Relax. The kid did
his job, all right?

86
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,835
I ever say that the kid
wasn't great at his job? No.

87
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,371
I think he's a star.

88
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,341
Would I vouch for him
if he wasn't?

89
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,250
Got to hand it to you,
totem pole,

90
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:30,188
you're either hard as
nails or scared as shit.

91
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,625
Which one is it?

92
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,772
What do you think
about that, baby?

93
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,809
Mommy and daddy
are getting it on.

94
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:51,609
Enough.

95
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,178
Yeah, where do you get off?

96
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,579
Right...

97
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,548
Here.

98
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,452
Okay, folks,
if you don't see me again,

99
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:03,088
it's 'cause I'm dead.

100
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,257
Tell me about tonight, buddy.

101
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:12,030
Tonight, darling,
we will have post-heist
revelry at bacchanalia.

102
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:15,033
Why, that is
the finest winin' and dinin'

103
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:18,803
of all the wines
and dines in town.

104
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:21,806
Ah, that's us.

105
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:22,474
Bye.

106
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:23,975
Well, sir,
expect the lady and myself

107
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:27,378
to darken your door
once the nose bag is empty.

108
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,948
And, baby, you did good, kid.

109
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,984
Do me a favor.
Next time doc calls,

110
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,487
don't pick up.

111
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,622
Don't listen to him.

112
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:47,132
Now,
i get absolutely no pleasure
in taking candy from baby,

113
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:51,970
but we're fast approaching
the day when you...

114
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,306
Will be all paid up.

115
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,743
One more job and I'm done?

116
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,146
One more job and
we're straight.

117
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:03,681
Sound good?

118
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:04,516
Oh...

119
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:09,354
I was gonna wait
until we were square,
but what the hell.

120
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,322
These are for you.

121
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,425
Now give me your burner.

122
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,330
I'm gonna need you
behind the wheel
again real soon.

123
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,833
You call, I'm there.

124
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,776
<i> Here's what we know.</i>

125
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,444
<i> Two men and a woman</i>
<i> came into the bank branch</i>

126
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,980
<i> clad in black</i>
<i> business clothing,</i>

127
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,316
<i> trench coats,</i>
<i> bandanas and sunglasses.</i>

128
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,553
<i> They pulled guns</i>
<i> and ordered</i>
<i> everybody to the floor,</i>

129
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:43,054
<i> and then cleaned out</i>
<i> the registers.</i>

130
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:48,193
<i> And hear this,</i>
<i> they even swiped jewelry</i>
<i> from some of the customers.</i>

131
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:48,993
You awake?

132
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,695
<i> They ran out of the bank</i>
<i> to a waiting getaway car.</i>

133
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:55,033
<i> A driver was there</i>
<i> to take them away.</i>
<i> It was a red...</i>

135
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,169
Always.

136
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,971
You got it.

137
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,289
Spread to the edges!

138
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,561
<i> ...is a young Caucasian male.</i>

139

<i> His identity</i>
<i> remains as yet unknown,</i>

00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,232
<i> and police are</i>

00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:30,101
<i> who might recognize him</i>
<i> to come forward.</i>

142
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,170
<i> The search for</i>
<i> the suspect is ongoing.</i>

143
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,738
<i> Police pursued</i>
<i> the getaway vehicle</i>

144
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,042
<i> across downtown Atlanta</i>
<i> and i-85 by helicopter.</i>

145
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,484
Where is that cash from?

146
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,519
Work.

147
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:49,854
One more job.

148
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,357
Then I'm done.

149
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,593
You don't

150
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,794
belong

151
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,596
in that world.

152
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,866
Sorry, couldn't hear you.
I have a banana in my ear.

153
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,137
You heard me.

154
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,618
<i> They grow up</i>
<i> so freaking fast,</i>

155

158
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:30,461
<i> And still the bull stands,</i>

<i> He's had his tries</i>

161
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,168
<i> Now he must try to</i>
<i> end this on foot.</i>

162
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,938
<i> "Retarded" means slow.</i>
<i> Was he slow?</i>

163
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,705
<i> No.</i>

164
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,140
<i> Was he slow?</i>

00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:42,907
<i> No.</i>

166

<i> ...slow? ...Slow? ...Slow?</i>

173
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,275
So, what can I get
you this fine morning?

174
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,778
Uh...

175
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,280
Oh, don't worry
if you need a second.

176
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:05,183
I have all

177
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,652
Whoa, are you recording this?

178
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,187
Oh, uh...

179
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,888
Am I being monitored
for quality assurance?

180
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,457
No. I... I...

181
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,191
No.

182
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,293
Um, hello? Hello, testing.

183
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:19,230
What can I get you
this fine morning, sir?

184
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,666
Um...

185
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:24,735
Oh, um, you know
that's a kid's menu, right?

186
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:25,636
Yeah, oh.

187
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:26,671
I get it. It's early.

188
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:29,574
So you just starting your day
or did you just get off?

189
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:34,045
Oh, I don't know
if I ever get off.
They call, I go, you know?

190
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,483
So, what is it you do?

191
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,518
I'm a driver.

192
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,019
Oh, like a...
Like a chauffeur.

193
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:44,021
You drive around
important people?

194
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,356
I guess I do.

195
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,958
Anyone I'd know?

196
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,925
I hope not.

197
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,294
Well, aren't you mysterious.

198
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,329
Maybe.

199
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,698
Maybe?

200
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,135
So, when was the last time
you hit the road just for fun?

201
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,302
Yesterday.

202
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,370
Oh, then I'm jealous.

203
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,873
Sometimes all I want to do
is head west on 20

204
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:05,343
in a car I can't afford
with a plan I don't have.

205
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:08,479
Just me,
my music and the road.

206
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,614
I'd like that, too.

207
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:12,116
Oh.

208
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:14,085
Uh, so,
you decide on anything yet?

209
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,621
You are so beautiful.

210
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,990
You just decided that.

211
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,459
Oh, well, thank you.

212
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:22,960
I'm sure you don't mean it.

213
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,862
I do mean it.

214
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,464
Jonathan?

215
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:27,932
Oh, sorry.

216
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:29,133
You know,
this isn't my badge.

217
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,902
I've only just
started here, so...

218
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:32,470
As a Jonathan?

219
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,839
Yeah. As a Jonathan.

220
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,709
Well, um, if you
have any more questions,
just holler.

221
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,383
I have a question.

222
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,119
What's that song
you're singing?

223
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,983
I approve.

224
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,551
Of the song?

225
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,120
Of the girl.

226
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,708
<i> Oh, there you are.</i>
<i> I've been calling, baby.</i>

227
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,009
You have?
<i> I have.</i>

228
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,678
<i> My chicken just</i>
<i> laid a very big egg.</i>

229
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,380
<i> You in?</i>
Am I in?

230
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:52,583
<i> It was</i>
<i> a rhetorical question, baby.</i>

231
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,252
<i> You're in.</i>

232
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:55,820
I'll be there.

233
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,131
Meet your new crew.

234
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:11,369
Over here is Eddie no nose,
formerly Eddie the nose.

235
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:12,570
Why, what happened?

236
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:13,604
Don't ask me that.

237
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,173
That's a no nose no-no,
page one.

238
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,141
And right here is jd.

239
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:18,909
He put the "Asian"
in home invasion.

240
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:21,545
And over there is
the one and the only bats.

241
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:22,613
No need for intros, doc.

242
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:26,417
Everybody from the jungle
to the trap know bats.

243
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,387
This your boy, right?

244
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:32,323
This the one you say
listens to the music
all the time?

245
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:35,993
The driver's supposed
to be the eyes and the ears,

246
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:37,061
not just the eyes.

247
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:39,530
Why does he listen to music
all the time, doc?

248
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,365
- He's got mental problems?
- No, no, no, no.

249
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:44,869
I'm the one got
the mental problems
in the crew.

250
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:45,970
Position taken.

251
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,338
He's got tinnitus.

252
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,239
Tinna-what?

253
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:49,707
He had an accident
when he was a kid.

254
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:53,344
He's still got
a hum in the drum.
Plays music to drown it out.

255
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:57,648
Yeah, but you feel me.

256
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,119
Hat?

257
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:02,853
Huh?

258
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,388
Your tattoo says, "hat."

259
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,157
Yeah. It used to say "hate."

260
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,494
But to increase my
chances of employment,
i got the "e" removed.

261
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,263
How's that
working out for you?

262
00:22:12,265 --> 00:22:14,632
Who doesn't like hats?

263
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:15,466
So, doc,

264
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:17,168
how many jobs
you done with the kid?

265
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,769
If you can't take
my word for him,

266
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,305
then get back in
that fucking elevator.

267
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:24,642
You never heard of
the spirit of 85?

268
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,911
The joyrider?
Yeah.

269
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:30,214
The ghost that baited
cops doing 130 on 85.

270
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,450
Headlights off,
brake lights disconnected.

271
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,719
He drove 'em around in circles
on spaghetti junction.

272
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:37,722
Left 'em in
the dust every time.
That was our boy there.

273
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,223
Wasn't that,
like, 10 years ago?
Yeah.

274
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,591
Well, like I said,
that was our boy.

275
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,660
He's been boosting cars
since he was old enough

276
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:43,694
to see over the dash.

277
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,363
He stole my Mercedes.
Had a lot of merch in it.

278
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,264
I watched him do it, too.
I didn't stop him, though,

279
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:50,101
'cause I was just blinded
by the balls on that kid.

280
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:51,469
'Course he didn't know
who I was,

281
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:53,471
or the worth of
the junk in the trunk
once he dumped it,

282
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:57,074
but once I tracked him down,
i made sure to
tell him who I was,

283
00:22:57,076 --> 00:23:00,077
what I was capable of,
and how much he owed me.

284
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,712
And since he's
been paying me back,

285
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,115
he's also shown me
what he's capable of.

286
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:04,782
Wow.

287
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,283
I just drew a whole
goddamn map in chalk

288
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:08,018
while we've been
standing here squawking.

289
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,988
That's pretty
fucking impressive, right?

290
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,691
Shop, let's talk it.
Baby, you with us?

291
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,667
Bank robbers. Whatever.

292
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:00,104
It's got to be
ready for an 8:30 start
in the A.M.

293
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,772
Questions?

294
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:03,908
I got a question, doc.

295
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,144
Why would I believe
phones over here heard
a goddamn word you said?

296
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:11,449
You laid down
your whole play.
He ain't even listening.

297
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,118
Baby?

298
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,224
The target is an armored truck

299
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:22,059
at perimeter trust
in dunwoody,
10:00 A.M. sharp.

300
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:23,227
We have
the details of the route

301
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:25,229
because someone at the depot
has a nasal problem.

302
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:27,231
The bank itself
is right near
the buford highway,

303
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,466
so we should be able
to hit the ramp

304
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:29,834
within 60 seconds
of getting out.

305
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,068
We also have a diversion crew.

306
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,671
They're gonna blow up
a bread truck a ways away,

307
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:34,672
keep the fuzz busy.

308
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,674
The dress code
is the Michael Myers
<i> Halloween</i> mask,

309
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:40,644
but don't all buy your masks
at the same time.
It looks suspicious.

310
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,712
The switch car is ready,

311
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,747
but you want me to hit
the long-stay
parking structure

312
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:44,782
at hartsfield-Jackson

313
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:46,684
to get a heist vehicle
that stays colder longer.

314
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:48,385
Boost a commuter car,
a family car,

315
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,254
something that blends in well
with morning traffic.

316
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:54,191
Something on the heavy side
in case we need to ram
the cops off the road.

317
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:57,027
A escalade, Yukon,
avalanche, whatever.

318
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:01,499
It needs to be ready
for an 8:30 start in the A.M.

319
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,968
Questions?

320
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,436
Well, ain't y'all cute.

321
00:25:05,438 --> 00:25:07,271
That's my baby.

322
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:09,173
Fuck your baby.

323
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,398
What's in there
is ours.

324
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,233
It belongs to us.

325
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:38,836
They took our money,
our hard-earned paper.

326
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,571
They snuck in
when we were asleep
last night

327
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:44,108
and took
the pants off the chair
and emptied our wallets.

328
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,811
They got what's
rightfully ours.

329
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,047
Let's go get it back,

330
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,082
what's rightfully ours.

331
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,288
What the fuck is this mask?

332
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,355
Austin powers.

333
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:00,391
Doc said Michael Myers!

334
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:01,492
This is Mike Myers!

335
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:03,060
It should be
the<i> Halloween</i> mask.

336
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,061
This is a Halloween mask!

337
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,630
No, the killer dude
from<i> Halloween.</i>

338
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:07,731
Oh, you mean Jason.

339
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,934
- No!
- No! God! Fuck!

340
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:11,268
Let's go.
Wait, wait.

341
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,304
I got to start the song over.

342
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,074
The fuck?

343
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,609
What?

344
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:19,543
Okay, go.

345
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,288
Move!

346
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,290
Go!

347
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:51,875
Go!

348
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,877
Yeah, we out! Let's go!

349
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,479
- Let's move!
- I got this.

350
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:58,415
Come on! Let's go!

351
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,884
Man up!
It's a tough business.

352
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,353
Go! Hit it!

353
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:03,220
Yeah, baby!

354
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,559
Look out! Fuck!

355
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:09,593
What the fuck?

356
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:10,694
- We got a hero!
- Go!

357
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,638
God damn!
Fuck! Get him!

358
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,942
Do your job, baby.
Let's go!

359
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,844
Shit!

360
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,216
Watch out,
watch out, watch out!

361
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,596
Yeah!

362
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,870
That's how you do it, baby!

363
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,473
Come on!

364
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,376
Yes!

365
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,680
Ha!

366
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,851
What the fuck?
Soldier boy.

367
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:08,919
He ain't giving up, huh?

368
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,063
Come on, soldier boy.

369
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:21,665
Shit!

370
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,267
Ah! No, no, no, no! No!

371
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,270
No!
No!

372
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,674
Got your ass now.

373
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,292
Damn it! I had that
g.I. Joe motherfucker
dead to rights!

374
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,127
God damn!

375
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:53,397
New ride. Let's go.

376
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:59,036
Come on, boys, let's rock!

377
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:00,904
Move! Move! Move! Move!

378
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,473
Huh? Sweetheart.
Oh, my love.

379
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:06,510
Get out the car!

380
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:07,311
I have a child!

381
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:08,879
I got one, too.
Get the fuck out!

382
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:11,482
No!
Come on!

383
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:13,917
Get in! Let's move.

384
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:16,320
Here, it's okay.

385
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,188
- Bring your sorry ass over!
- God damn it! Shit!

386
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,023
- Baby, what are you doing?
- Here, take him.

387
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,625
Leave the baby in the car.
Leave the baby in the car!

388
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:23,093
Get your damn weird ass
over here now!

389
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:28,132
- Come on! Let's go!
- I'm coming!

390
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,170
Let's rock!

391
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,307
Let's go!

392
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,412
Oh, shit! No! Fuck!

393
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,382
I left my shotgun behind.

394
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:46,183
What?

395
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:47,417
I left my shotgun behind.

396
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:51,388
Not groovy, jd.
Not groovy at all.

397
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,491
Cops! Cops! Cops!

398
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:57,828
Shit. Get down.

399
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,131
Stay down. Stay down.

400
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,917
<i> All units be on the lookout</i>

401
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,654
<i> for a red saturn aura,</i>
<i> license plate...</i>

402
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:43,207
You see jd over there?
Now, jd's a idiot.

403
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,676
But you a bright boy, though.

404
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:48,045
So I got a question for you.

405
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,415
You make me miss that shot?

406
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,719
Come on, now.

407
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,055
You can tell me.

408
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,724
No.

409
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,227
You're a good driver.

410
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:05,395
You're a bad liar, though.

411
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:10,734
In this business,
the moment you
catch feelings...

412
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:14,538
Is the moment
you catch a bullet.

413
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,007
Now, pick up your purse
and go get the coffee.

414
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:48,438
About goddamn time.

415
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,079
Oh, you looking for jd?

416
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,548
International man of mystery?

417
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,718
'Cause he's long gone, baby.

418
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:04,321
You got that right.

419
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:07,557
Just put it down.
We'll drink it.

420
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,038
So, this is it.

421
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,073
I'm a man of my word.

422
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,478
And you're all straight,
baby.

423
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:30,847
That's it?

424
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:31,715
Sure is.

425
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:35,285
- You're all paid up.
- Cause for celebration.

426
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,654
Yeah, sure is.

427
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:40,891
Oh.

428
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:43,961
Yeah, well, before you
go completely crazy...

429
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:52,602
You need to
sunset that ride.

430
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,938
Drive safe, baby.

431
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:32,095
You're back.

432
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:34,131
I sure am.
Well, then, you, sir,

433
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:35,565
are gonna be
my very last customer,

434
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:39,536
because I am
walking out that door
in precisely 30 seconds.

435
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:40,904
You're leaving?

436
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:41,938
Yes, sir.

437
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,906
Can I come with you?

438
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:45,375
You don't have
work or nothing?

439
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,613
Uh, I don't.
I am done with work.

440
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:50,981
Wow. You seem real
happy about that.

441
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:53,083
Yeah, I sure am.

442
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:54,017
God damn it!

443
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:55,886
I don't blame you.
Well, you're welcome
to come with,

444
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:59,823
but I don't know how
exciting you're gonna
find the laundromat.

445
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:00,390
Huh?

446
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,825
I got to run some errands.
Oh.

447
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:06,630
But think about what
you want, and I will
stick around just for you.

448
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:07,430
Coffee?

449
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:10,433
Please. Uh, cream and sugar.

450
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:13,537
So, how you
two getting along?

451
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:14,371
Oh, good.

452
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:15,405
He's sweet, isn't he?

453
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:18,642
That kid?
He's been coming here
since before me.

454
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:21,811
Think maybe his mom
used to work here.

455
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,813
Huh.

456
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,017
Know what you want?

457
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:30,921
Your name?

458
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:33,523
Well,
you can get that for free.

459
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:35,659
It's Debbie. Debora.

460
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,961
Oh, like the song.

461
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:39,029
The Beck one? Yeah.

462
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:43,600
Well, except I'm
d-e-b-o-r-a, and I think
that's just d-e-b-r-a.

463
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:45,235
I don't know that one.

464
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:46,736
Oh, it goes, um...

465
00:36:59,284 --> 00:36:59,950
Jenny?

466
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:02,118
The song's about him wanting
to get with Jenny

467
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,487
and her sister, too,
whose name is Debra.

468
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:08,291
So it's not even
really about me.
It's about the sister.

469
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:12,529
My sister's name is Mary.
She has got all the songs.

470
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,364
"Mary, Mary,
where you goin' to?"

471
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:16,366
"Proud Mary keep on burnin'."

472
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:17,968
"The wind cries Mary."

473
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,103
She's got me beat. Again.

474
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:23,707
She's got endless songs.
I got one.

475
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,475
No, you got two.

476
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:26,409
What's the other one?

477
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,178
<i> Debora,</i>
the song I'm talking about.

478
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,614
Who by?
Trex.

479
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:32,482
T.Rex?

480
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:33,316
Uh, yeah.

481
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,619
I've heard of them,
but don't know that one.

482
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:37,320
How's it go?

483
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,056
Oh.

484
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:46,329
"A zeb-ora"?

485
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:47,631
Like a zebra, I guess.

486
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,699
Yeah.
Well,
I'm wearing black and white,

487
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,601
so you can call me deebra.

488
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:54,337
Actually, I actually
got<i> debora</i> on here.

489
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:57,707
Okay, what?
How many of those
do you have?

490
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:01,611
Oh, I got different iPods
for different days and moods.

491
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:05,315
Oh. And you're in
a pink and glittery mood.

492
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,384
I am now.

493
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:10,887
What is your name?

494
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:13,056
Baby.
Wait, what?

495
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:14,491
Your name's baby?

496
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:16,259
B-a-b-y, baby?

497
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:16,993
Yeah.

498
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:19,462
Well, then,
you have us all beat.

499
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,498
Every damn song is about you.

500
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,134
We could drive back and forth
across the states forever

501
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:25,935
and never run out
of "baby" songs.

502
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,271
We might run out
of gas, though.

503
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:33,643
Did your mom call
you "baby" as a kid?

504
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,744
Sometimes.

505
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:37,047
She used to work here?

506
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:41,651
Sometimes, but,
uh, she was a singer, too.

507
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,220
What does she do now?

508
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,123
Nothing.

509
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,760
Uh, I could find
<i> debora</i> if you want.

510
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,462
Debbie!

511
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:54,698
For crying out loud.

512
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:56,866
Well, uh, play it
for me sometime

513
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:59,402
I don't have to
get out of here.

514
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,737
Deal?

515
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,138
Yeah, deal.

516
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,808
Now,
you know what you want yet?

517
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,676
To get out of here.

518
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:29,833
You're right. I do like it.

519
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:31,134
Good.

520
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:34,204
So, what's your story, baby?

521
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,939
You from here?

522
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:37,107
I am.

523
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:39,809
Keep going. Keep going.

524
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:41,010
You're from here.
Uh-huh.

525
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:46,116
You're a driver.
You like music.
You don't talk much.

526
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:46,850
No.

527
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:50,353
I've, uh, spoken more
to you today

528
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:52,489
than I have to
anyone all year.

529
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:54,090
Whoa.

530
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:55,592
Okay.

531
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:58,194
Not a motor-mouth. Noted.

532
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:00,096
Yeah, yeah. I have...

533
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:03,099
I have this,
uh, hearing thing.

534
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,402
I was in an accident
when I was little.

535
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:07,237
Is that what
happened to your mom?

536
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,472
Yeah. Yeah, and my dad.

537
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:11,941
I miss her.

538
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,577
I'm sorry.

539
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,478
No, don't be.

540
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,781
I live with my foster dad,
but now he's getting old,

541
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:20,450
so it's more like
I'm looking after him.

542
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:23,219
Yeah. I know how that feels.

543
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:26,256
I had to look after my mom
when she got sick.

544
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:29,292
It might seem tough now,
but once they're gone,

545
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:32,462
you'll miss having
someone to care for.

546
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:36,599
I don't have much to
keep me here anymore.

547
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,401
You don't?

548
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:42,872
You know,

549
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:47,343
mmm, we could get together
some other time,
some other place?

550
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:51,414
Oh, you mean, uh,
somewhere that's not
a diner or a laundromat?

551
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:54,717
Yeah, well,
it's not that
this isn't nice but...

552
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,422
Oh, well,
we could go to, uh... um...

553
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:00,490
Oh, bacchanalia.

554
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:02,459
I've never been.
I... I hear it's nice.

555
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:05,061
Oh, it's...
It's the finest
winin' and dinin'

556
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:07,597
of all the wines
and dines in town.

557
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,632
That is nice.

558
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,968
Um, but they got
me pulling doubles
this week, though.

559
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,871
What about next week?
What's your schedule like?

560
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:15,605
I don't know.

561
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:18,274
Oh, I forgot.
They call, you go.

562
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:20,477
No, I mean, I'm...
I'm not working.

563
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:22,145
You're not driving anymore?

564
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,480
No.

565
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:24,714
I'm sorry.

566
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:26,549
No, don't be.
It's my choice.

567
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,985
Well,
aren't you the lucky one.

568
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,538
So who's debora?

569
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,740
The girl.

570
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:53,843
<i> His name, Malik Kelly,</i>
<i> a local veteran.</i>

571
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:59,015
<i> You saw what these</i>
<i> folks were doing.</i>
<i> You took action. Why?</i>

572
00:41:59,017 --> 00:41:59,749
I'm done.

573
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:03,253
<i> I saw these guys</i>
<i> go marching in the bank</i>
<i> with Halloween masks,</i>

574
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:04,454
<i> weapons drawn.</i>

575
00:42:04,456 --> 00:42:05,788
<i> They were attacking...</i>

576
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,557
<i> Is this the place?</i>

577
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,229
Here.

578
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,198
Pizza?

579
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,201
Are we celebrating?

580
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,036
Celebrating you getting

581
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,071
a real job.

582
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,774
What kind of job?

583
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:25,808
Wouldn't it be good

584
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,479
to bring joy to people

585
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:33,249
when you drive?

586
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,585
Pizza?

587
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:42,358
Order's up!

588
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:02,245
Whoa.

589
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,347
That was fast.

590
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:05,014
I know.

591
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:08,117
Pizza!

592
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,095
Look...

593
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,698
You only have to
wash your hands once

594
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,033
after counting that.

595
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:25,668
I know.

596
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,070
And not put

597
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:28,905
other lives

598
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:29,739
in danger.

599
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:34,377
I won't let anything bad
happen to you.

600
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,379
I'm not talking

601
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:37,880
about me.

602
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:23,860
You're all good.
A gentleman
picked this up already.

603
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:25,428
A gentleman?

604
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:28,765
Who is that?

605
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,601
It's my old boss.

606
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:33,870
Uh...

607
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:36,272
Excuse me one second.

608
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:39,942
- Here you are, madam.
- Thank you very much.

609
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,145
Have a good night.

610
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:45,181
Good meal, baby?

611
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:48,518
That foie gras terrine
is something, huh?

612
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:49,352
Yeah.

613
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:50,787
You don't look
happy to see me. Why?

614
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:54,357
I said we were straight,
but did you think
we were done?

615
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,059
That that was it?

616
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:57,360
Uh, I guess I did.

617
00:44:57,362 --> 00:45:00,697
Well, I could give you
the good news
and the bad news,

618
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:01,931
except there is no bad news.

619
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:04,367
The good news is
you're about to
make a lot of money.

620
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:08,638
And the good news is
you're about to
make a lot of money.

621
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,806
I got... I got a job, doc.

622
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:13,009
Yeah, but why slave away
delivering goodfellas pizzas

623
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:14,877
just to afford
a night out here,

624
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,747
when you could
make all that dough
with a great fella? Me.

625
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:21,818
And then take your gal here
for fucking dinner
every night of the week?

626
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:25,054
You paid off your debt.
Now it's time to profit.

627
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,189
This is the fun bit, baby.

628
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:28,391
By the time this job is over,
you'll be rolling in money,

629
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:33,596
buying maseratis
and feeding your gal
catfish dipped in gold.

630
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:35,732
So, what do you say?
You in?

631
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:37,567
Am I in?

632
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:39,836
No, don't answer my question
with another question.

633
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:43,272
You give me one of
two replies. Yes or no.

634
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,375
No, doc.

635
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:50,913
You know I never do a job
with the exact same
crew twice, right?

636
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:51,881
Yes.
And you also know

637
00:45:51,883 --> 00:45:55,551
you've been my driver
for every job since we met.

638
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,787
Yes.

639
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:02,091
So, I'm of the thinking
that you are my lucky charm

640
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:05,661
and that I'm not doing
this job without you.

641
00:46:05,663 --> 00:46:07,430
Now, I don't think
i need to give you
the speech

642
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:08,664
about what happens
when you say no,

643
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:10,733
how I could break your legs
and kill everyone you love,

644
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:13,469
because you already
know that, don't you?

645
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:16,105
Yeah.

646
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,373
So, what's it gonna be,

647
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,309
behind the wheel
or in a wheelchair?

648
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:22,311
The first one.

649
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,982
I'll pick you up
in the morning.

650
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,684
Don't stay out
too late, now.

651
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:29,352
Oh.

652
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:33,523
And your, uh, waitress
girlfriend, she's cute.

653
00:46:33,525 --> 00:46:35,691
Let's keep it that way.

654
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:38,161
Good night, sir.

655
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:44,367
<i> Well,</i>
<i> that was some pretty fine</i>
<i> winin' and dinin'.</i>

656
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:48,104
Must have
friends in high places
to get a table there.

657
00:46:48,106 --> 00:46:50,907
Oh, I don't know
about that.

658
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:55,344
Is everything okay, baby?

659
00:46:58,248 --> 00:46:59,215
It will be.

660
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:03,286
You want to talk about it?
I make a mean cup of coffee.

661
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:07,857
I mean, I... I don't.
I make terrible coffee.

662
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,326
I want to, but I...

663
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,994
I can't right now.

664
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,096
You know, you...

665
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:17,266
You don't have
to worry about me.

666
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:18,868
You can tell me anything.

667
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,503
I'm not worried about you.

668
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:22,238
I mean, I...

669
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,642
You're the best thing
that's happened to me
in a long time.

670
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:33,282
And I just worry that
I'm not good enough for you.

671
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:37,053
Oh, well, don't.

672
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:43,693
I can see you're kind
and you're different.

673
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:47,997
And I'm here for you
when you're ready.

674
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:01,677
What are you doing tomorrow?

675
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,781
Uh, you tell me.

676
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:30,439
Good morning.

677
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,643
These places never
get rolled.

678
00:48:33,645 --> 00:48:36,879
People don't realize
that there's gold
in them there hills.

679
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:38,981
And those that do,
don't have the stones

680
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:41,050
to pull off a job so
public in the hub of it.

681
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:43,085
This place'll be ripe
around this time tomorrow,

682
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,221
but I need you to do
something for me today.

683
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:47,857
I can't be seen in there,
but you can.

684
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:48,758
So go inside.

685
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,494
Take note of the number
of cameras and positions,

686
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:52,828
the number of registers open,

687
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,731
the number of employees
and the number of customers.

688
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:57,733
Is there a guard?
Is he armed?

689
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,502
Do they have bandit glass?

690
00:48:59,504 --> 00:49:01,537
And get in line,
buy some stamps.

691
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:04,907
Take your buds out,
pull your shades off.

692
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:09,445
Oh, and, uh, take the nephew.
Less suspicious.

693
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:13,950
<i> The United States</i>
<i> postal service.</i>

694
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:17,386
<i> We're here, working for you,</i>
<i> seven days a week.</i>

695
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:20,289
<i> We do a lot more</i>
<i> than just stamps these days.</i>

696
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,192
<i> You'd be surprised at</i>
<i> what we have to offer.</i>

697
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:26,562
<i> Yeah, Jack, all looks</i>
<i> fine back here. Over.</i>

698
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:44,113
No bandit glass,
one armed guard,

699
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:47,583
10 cameras,
eight registers, two open,

700
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:51,420
11 customers and
four employees.

701
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:53,589
Thank you.

702
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:57,960
Uh...

703
00:49:57,962 --> 00:49:59,929
Uh, stamps.

704
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,132
That your boy?

705
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,734
Sure.

706
00:50:04,736 --> 00:50:06,168
Yeah, he sure is.

707
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,670
How old is he?

708
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:10,506
Four.
Eight.

709
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:13,642
They grow up so
freaking fast, don't they?

710
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,513
Does he have a name?

711
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:20,016
You have a name, don't you?

712
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:20,750
Samm.

713
00:50:20,752 --> 00:50:23,619
Well, samm, I got a mint
with your name on it.

714
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:26,922
You have a mint
that says "samm"?

715
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:28,157
Aw.

716
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:29,959
Sweet.

717
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:30,960
Are you here tomorrow?

718
00:50:30,962 --> 00:50:34,530
Sure am. Working 9:00
to 5:00, just like Dolly.

719
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:37,566
Oh, Dolly parton. Yeah.

720
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:39,435
I like her.
Mmm, who doesn't?

721
00:50:39,437 --> 00:50:41,404
"Everybody wants happiness,
nobody wants pain.

722
00:50:41,406 --> 00:50:44,840
"But you can't have a rainbow
without a little rain."

723
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:46,742
Wise lady.

724
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,678
Yeah, she sure is.
Hmm.

725
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,414
Bye.

726
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:01,991
Hit me.

727
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:05,361
No bandit glass,
one armed guard,

728
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:09,465
10 cameras,
eight registers, three open.

729
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,668
And, uh, 11 customers.

730
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,340
And, uh, four employees.

731
00:51:18,342 --> 00:51:20,109
Anything else?

732
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,111
The teller seemed nice.

733
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:23,579
She gave me a mint.

734
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:24,580
Did she?
Yeah.

735
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,049
You probably
wouldn't even need
to use a gun with her.

736
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:31,720
Just say "boo,"
and she'll give you
the big bills first.

737
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,056
Chip's off the old block.

738
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:45,134
What floor are you on?

739
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:46,702
Third.

740
00:51:46,704 --> 00:51:50,539
Those stairs
must be a real bitch
for Joe, huh?

741
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,509
It's my business
to know everything.

742
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:55,678
So, are they a bitch?

743
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,780
There's an elevator.

744
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:01,784
Ooh, fancy.

745
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:05,387
So, am I gonna
see you tonight?

746
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:07,323
Yes, you will.

747
00:52:07,325 --> 00:52:09,592
You're not just saying
what you think
i want to hear, right?

748
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:13,162
You consider me a friend,
don't you?

749
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:14,763
You and I are a team.

750
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:18,267
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

751
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:19,668
Good to know.

752
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:22,271
You'll be out of
this shithole soon.

753
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:25,774
You're going up
in the world!

754
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,552
Bo's diner,
what'll you have?

755
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:38,487
<i> Is debora there?</i>

756
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,356
Debbie, phone.

757
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,424
Keep it short.

758
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:44,793
Hello?
<i> It's baby.</i>

759
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:48,697
Hey. To what do
i owe this honor?

760
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:51,534
<i> I just wanted to</i>
<i> hear your voice.</i>

761
00:52:51,536 --> 00:52:53,702
Am I still seeing you later?

762
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:55,371
<i> I have to drive again.</i>

763
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:59,008
Oh, okay. Thought
y'all were done with that.

764
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:03,612
<i> So did I.</i>
<i> It's not what I want.</i>

765
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:06,315
And what do you want, baby?

766
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:09,985
I want us to head west on 20,

767
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:12,755
in a car we can't afford,

768
00:53:12,757 --> 00:53:15,424
with a plan we don't have.

769
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:19,028
Keep driving and never stop.

770
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:20,863
Are you serious?

771
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,865
<i> I am, debora.</i>

772
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:25,834
You in?

773
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:27,703
I'm in, baby.

774
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:29,205
<i> See you soon.</i>

775
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,191
There he is.

776
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:51,427
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.

777
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,861
Hear-no-evil's back, huh?

778
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:55,431
Have you seen this kid move?
Yeah, I've seen him.

779
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:56,832
Think doc likes
having him around

780
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:59,301
because he can park
in the disabled
spots by the bank.

781
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:00,769
- Disabled spot?
- Yeah.

782
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:03,439
He got some shit
wrong with his ears.
Tinnitus or something.

783
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:06,275
Anyway, he gotta listen
to music 24 hours a day

784
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:08,510
to drown out
the whining in his ears.

785
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:09,612
Oh, shit!

786
00:54:09,614 --> 00:54:11,680
You know who else has
the exact same thing

787
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:14,650
and does that
exact same thing?

788
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:15,484
Barbra Streisand.

789
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:17,152
Darling, do I look like
i know a fucking thing

790
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:18,520
about Barbra
fucking Streisand?

791
00:54:18,522 --> 00:54:22,057
Hey! Watch your mouth.
That's my lady
you're talking to.

792
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:23,659
Yeah.

793
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:25,728
Watch your mouth.

794
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:28,297
I'll watch what
i want to watch.

795
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,103
Is that true?

796
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:36,472
Is that why you have
music in your
head all the time?

797
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:37,873
Drown out the noise?

798
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:38,774
Yeah.

799
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:40,209
It keeps me moving.

800
00:54:40,211 --> 00:54:42,544
It's an escape. I get it.

801
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:46,548
Hey, buddy,
you seen a violin?
I had a violin here.

802
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,584
Shut up.

803
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,253
I used to fool
around with cars
when I was a kid.

804
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:55,057
Drive around all
night like a speed freak
listening to the radio.

805
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:57,860
I used to have
my special tape

806
00:54:57,862 --> 00:55:00,929
that had my killer
track on it. Get me flying.

807
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:02,598
You got one of those?

808
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,266
Sure.

809
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:06,068
Well, what is it?

810
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,103
<i> Brighton rock.</i>
What?

811
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:09,672
Queen?

812
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:11,206
Yeah.

813
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:13,309
It's got that
crazy big guitar solo.

814
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:14,209
Yeah, I know that song.

815
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:15,978
My brother used to
play<i> sheer heart attack</i>

816
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,913
right through the wall.

817
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:19,381
You got it on here?

818
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:21,383
Uh, I got it on this one.

819
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:24,853
Play it.
Let's hear that killer track.

820
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:36,131
Yeah.

821
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:44,106
What you ladies
listening to?

822
00:55:44,108 --> 00:55:45,140
Queen.
Queen!

823
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:47,910
Queen? Streisand, now queen.
What the fuck?
What y'all gonna do?

824
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:50,379
Y'all gonna
belt out show tunes
on the way to the job?

825
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:52,314
You don't need
a score for a score.

826
00:55:52,316 --> 00:55:53,782
You just...

827
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:58,187
Put your fucking
foot on the gas
and drive the goddamn car.

828
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:00,389
That's all
the music you need, folks.

829
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:01,990
Come on, now.

830
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:05,627
You never been a wheelman?
You never had a lucky song?

831
00:56:05,629 --> 00:56:10,099
Well, a cigarette song.
<i>Apres-</i> heist, glass of scotch.

832
00:56:10,101 --> 00:56:11,100
Absolutely.

833
00:56:11,102 --> 00:56:12,968
But not before a job.

834
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:16,905
I got enough demons
right here playing
music all the time.

835
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:18,073
Yeah, well, that I believe.

836
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:19,908
Had a buddy once
walk away from a job.
You know why?

837
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:22,311
Because something was playing
on the radio he didn't like.

838
00:56:22,313 --> 00:56:25,381
We about to go in,
he won't get out
the fucking car. Why?

839
00:56:25,383 --> 00:56:27,416
'Cause<i> knock, knock,</i>
<i> knockin' on heaven's door</i>

840
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:31,086
is playing on the fm.
He called it a hex song.

841
00:56:31,088 --> 00:56:33,455
That,<i> end of the road</i>
by boyz ii men,

842
00:56:33,457 --> 00:56:35,190
<i> hotel California</i>
by the eagles.

843
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:36,392
He called 'em all hex songs.

844
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:39,795
Then come talking
about some crazy shit
like we all gonna die.

845
00:56:39,797 --> 00:56:41,063
So what?
You bail on the job?

846
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:42,798
Fuck no,
i didn't bail on the job.

847
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,466
I went and got that money.

848
00:56:44,468 --> 00:56:46,402
And we didn't die, either.

849
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:48,437
Now, he bought it
a little later,

850
00:56:48,439 --> 00:56:50,506
but it had nothing
to do with the heist.

851
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:53,642
Do all your stories end up
with somebody dying?

852
00:56:54,712 --> 00:56:57,913
I guess you just
got to find out, huh?

853
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:02,084
I need four pairs of eyes
and three sets of ears.

854
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,052
Gather round.

855
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:15,998
The postal service is dying.

856
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,467
People don't care
about their mail anymore.

857
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:22,938
Lucky for us,
their loss is our gain.

858
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,573
Money orders.

859
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:27,576
For I happen to know a guy
who has a machine

860
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:30,579
that can turn
blank ones into green.

861
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:34,082
Each box contains
250 slips per box,

862
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:36,051
each slip worth
up to a grand.

863
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:38,720
That's quarter
a mil per box.

864
00:57:38,722 --> 00:57:40,789
Dot, dot, dot.
You do the math.

865
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,124
Darling goes in the front.

866
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:45,194
Buddy takes
a five-alligator count
and follows her inside.

867
00:57:45,196 --> 00:57:51,099
You put on these
privacy glasses
to blind the cctv camera.

868
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:52,601
Another five-alligator count.

869
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:55,471
Darling gets in line,
buddy takes her hostage,

870
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:56,405
shotgun to her head.

871
00:57:56,407 --> 00:57:59,441
That gets you guys
in the back office.

872
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:02,644
We role-play that a lot.

873
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:03,378
Uh-huh.

874
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,880
Baby drives bats
around the loading dock.

875
00:58:04,882 --> 00:58:09,451
Bats uses this security card
supplied by an insider
with a nasal problem

876
00:58:09,453 --> 00:58:11,487
to get in the staff entrance
and cover the rear.

877
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:14,656
You guys grab all the boxes
and then sneak out the back

878
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,125
to baby and the waiting car.

879
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,930
Did you get all that, baby?

880
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:22,931
Yeah.

881
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:24,066
Okay, one more thing.

882
00:58:24,068 --> 00:58:28,036
We need some fresh hardware,
not traceable to us
or any previous jobs.

883
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:32,274
Now, I've got some contacts
who can get us
some clean firepower,

884
00:58:32,276 --> 00:58:33,375
so the pickup is tonight.

885
00:58:33,377 --> 00:58:35,143
But after the pickup,
you come straight back here.

886
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:38,981
You all have an early
start in the morning,
and there's eyes everywhere.

887
00:58:38,983 --> 00:58:42,551
So, you're staying
the night here.

888
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:46,054
Oh, we in bed together now.

889
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:14,750
Pull over there.
I got to take a leak.

890
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,987
Want some gum?
Want some gum, buddy?

891
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:21,557
Yeah, I'll take some gum.

892
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:26,428
Tell me what we're gonna do
with all that money.

893
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:29,464
We're gonna go to Vegas.
We'll put it all on red.

894
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:32,434
We'll get married again.
It'll be real romantic.

895
00:59:32,436 --> 00:59:34,403
Mmm.

896
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:37,439
You know what was real,
real romantic?

897
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:40,175
What was real,
real romantic?

898
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:42,077
When you stabbed that guy.

899
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,245
Which guy?

900
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:45,614
The guy that robbed you,
the guy that
called you a whore,

901
00:59:45,616 --> 00:59:47,716
or the guy that
looked at you funny?

902
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:48,984
The last one.

903
00:59:48,986 --> 00:59:51,553
Yeah. I do remember that.

904
00:59:51,555 --> 00:59:54,156
Bats just looked at me funny.

905
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,194
You want me to kill bats?

906
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:02,431
Not before the job, silly.
Hmm?

907
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:05,801
You think we
should talk about this
in front of baby?

908
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:10,038
He won't say a thing.
Will you, baby? Hmm?

909
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:14,343
Jesus Christ.

910
01:00:14,345 --> 01:00:15,577
What,
did you steal all this?

911
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:16,845
You said
you wanted some gum.

912
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:20,649
Fuck I'm supposed
to do, pay for it?
Let's go.

913
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,485
Let's go.

914
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:33,895
Looks like
the farmers' market is open.

915
01:00:33,897 --> 01:00:34,997
Farmers' market?

916
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:38,834
Yeah. Doc says
we got to go see the butcher.

917
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:16,972
Come on,
you're going in with us.

918
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:19,808
We might not be
leaving in this.

919
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:28,083
And, uh, find
something funky on there.

920
01:01:28,085 --> 01:01:31,520
Just in case we got
to rip this joint up.

921
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,656
Take this.

922
01:01:34,658 --> 01:01:36,525
Act like you
know how to use it.

923
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:37,759
Why would he need it?

924
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:39,594
Got to swagger in
like you got one,

925
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:42,097
so we don't all look
like a bunch of pussies.

926
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:43,131
Darling excluded.

927
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:48,970
What's with the earbuds?
Recording this or something?

928
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:49,871
It's just his music.

929
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:52,574
Yeah, he's loony.
He's just like his tunes.

930
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:54,242
What's he listening to?

931
01:01:54,244 --> 01:01:56,178
How the fuck I know?

932
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:58,180
Let me check.

933
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:02,651
<i> Tequila!</i>

934
01:02:02,653 --> 01:02:03,618
Which reminds me,

935
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:06,288
why'd the Mexican dude
throw his wife off the cliff?

936
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:09,524
Ah! Ruined it.
Didn't I ruin it?

937
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:10,959
We met before, right?

938
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:13,562
I don't know.
You still alive, right?

939
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:14,162
Uh-huh.

940
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:16,164
Then I guess
we ain't never met.

941
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:18,433
Shut the fuck up!

942
01:02:18,435 --> 01:02:21,603
I've got it.
I've got it.

943
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:24,539
<i> Voila!</i>

944
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:28,009
Welcome to<i> la charcuterie.</i>

945
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:31,580
Tonight, gentlemen,<i> madame,</i>

946
01:02:31,582 --> 01:02:33,815
we have only
the finest cuts of pork,

947
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:36,384
direct from
the local smokehouse.

948
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:38,086
You're all experienced
butchers yourself.

949
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:41,089
I assume you are aware
that the humble pig
can be cooked

950
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:44,960
from nose to tail,
everything but the squeal.

951
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:46,928
I can offer you nine cuts

952
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,798
at the best prices
in all of christendom.

953
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,199
So let's dive in
head-first.

954
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:56,104
From the jowl comes
the godsent Roman bacon
that is guanciale.

955
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:58,640
From the shoulder
of the hog comes

956
01:02:58,642 --> 01:03:01,576
the Boston butt,
a tough but tasty cut.

957
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:02,944
The picnic shoulder
is a favorite

958
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:06,548
of those who enjoy
the smoking of pigs.

959
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:09,651
The center-cut loin,
the double-cut pork chops,

960
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:10,352
baby back ribs,

961
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:14,022
and the serrano ham,
on the back leg, of course.

962
01:03:14,024 --> 01:03:15,590
All delicious.

963
01:03:15,592 --> 01:03:16,458
Delicious.

964
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:20,529
And, of course,
we have a fine
selection of sausages.

965
01:03:20,531 --> 01:03:21,863
Well, I'm hungry.

966
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:23,365
<i> Fantastique.</i>

967
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:24,566
And your choice is...

968
01:03:24,568 --> 01:03:27,869
Well, I'm gonna go
with the picnic shoulder,

969
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,938
'cause, um, I just
love smoking pigs.

970
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,207
Done deal.

971
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:08,276
Dumb son of a bitch.

972
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:09,711
Whoa! Oh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

973
01:04:09,713 --> 01:04:11,479
Fuck, bats!
You got my wife shot!

974
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:12,347
I don't like that!

975
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:13,748
Relax, buddy.
You handled it!

976
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,218
What the fuck,
you piece of shit?
You shot the gunsmiths.

977
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:18,053
Weren't they
fucking doc's contacts?

978
01:04:18,055 --> 01:04:19,521
They were doc's contacts!

979
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:20,789
Guess what, they was pigs.

980
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:22,224
Look at the box.
It says "apd."

981
01:04:22,226 --> 01:04:23,625
I clocked that
tall strip of bacon

982
01:04:23,627 --> 01:04:26,995
with that fake-ass
Louis vuitton hat
right off the bat.

983
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:28,096
He busted me in '98.

984
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:30,799
Now, I don't know
about you lovebirds
fucking without a condom,

985
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:32,968
but when
somebody getting ready
to barbecue me,

986
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,202
I go full-metal
batshit on...

987
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:35,403
- Shit!
- Get him!

988
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:37,205
Baby, don't let him get away!
Get him! Get him!

989
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,374
Do something!
Get him!

990
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:41,009
Oh, shit!

991
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:51,419
Get us out of here, baby.
Let's move.

992
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:54,022
Come on, let's go. Move.

993
01:05:23,487 --> 01:05:25,420
Bats,
you are fucking crazy.

994
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:28,189
When your
folks name you bats,
you gonna end up crazy.

995
01:05:28,191 --> 01:05:31,226
I don't doubt you're crazy,
but your real name

996
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:32,527
is not bats.

997
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:33,395
So says you.

998
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:35,230
You think my real
name's darling?

999
01:05:35,232 --> 01:05:38,500
Yeah, or buddy?
No, they're nicknames.

1000
01:05:38,502 --> 01:05:40,568
Code names, monikers.

1001
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,905
So, what's your
real name, darling?

1002
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:45,006
Monica.

1003
01:05:45,008 --> 01:05:48,310
Hey,
i thought we weren't allowed
to discuss names.

1004
01:05:48,312 --> 01:05:49,844
We're not.

1005
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:52,147
Baby, what's your real name?

1006
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:54,983
Huh?

1007
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:57,986
Hey, stop, stop,
stop up here.

1008
01:05:57,988 --> 01:05:59,988
Stop up here.

1009
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:02,958
I said stop. I'm hungry.

1010
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:04,693
No.

1011
01:06:04,695 --> 01:06:06,428
Stop the car!

1012
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:10,832
No?

1013
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:12,968
You're telling me no?

1014
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:14,636
I don't want to go in there.

1015
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:16,905
"I don't want to
go in there."

1016
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:18,506
Well, hello, baby.

1017
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:21,076
Bodies hit the floor
back there,
you don't say shit.

1018
01:06:21,078 --> 01:06:22,410
Now all of a sudden,
you getting...

1019
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:25,080
You getting riled up
about stopping at a diner?

1020
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:27,082
I don't want to go in there.
It sucks.

1021
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:32,020
Well,
with that recommendation,
we gots to go in now.

1022
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:03,752
<i> Now, why y'all so mad?</i>
<i> You should be</i>
<i> thanking ol' bats.</i>

1023
01:07:03,754 --> 01:07:05,653
For being a walking
fucking death wish?

1024
01:07:05,655 --> 01:07:07,622
Well, I treat all of my
jobs like it's my last.

1025
01:07:07,624 --> 01:07:10,058
Yeah, but what you
do within this group
affects all of us.

1026
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:13,862
Fine, cowboy. You're gonna
get your money tomorrow.
Plus, uh...

1027
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:16,798
I know you guys
got noses to feed.

1028
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,099
What, yeah,
like you're Mr. clean.

1029
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:20,568
I'm Mr. whatever
the fuck I wanna be.

1030
01:07:21,605 --> 01:07:22,771
Can I get you
anything to drink?

1031
01:07:22,773 --> 01:07:25,006
Uh, yeah,
i think it'll be,
uh, coke all around, right?

1032
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:27,308
How... how you say it
in your language? Coca?

1033
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:30,278
So let me get three
cokes and one Coca.

1034
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,547
Four cokes?
Yeah.

1035
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,384
Look, here's the deal.

1036
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,286
You rob to
support a drug habit.

1037
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:40,388
I do drugs to
support a robbery habit.

1038
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,490
That's clever.
That's my job, see.

1039
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:44,325
It's you two
who's on vacation.

1040
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:46,494
So you doubt
our credentials?

1041
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:48,396
Wall street, right?
Doc tell you that?

1042
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,565
Doc ain't tell me shit.

1043
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:54,636
Just a educated guess
from an uneducated man.

1044
01:07:54,638 --> 01:07:57,939
Well, bats,
i would be fascinated to hear
your thoughts on the matter.

1045
01:07:57,941 --> 01:07:59,140
Tell me if I'm way off,
buddy.

1046
01:07:59,142 --> 01:08:03,912
You were a stockbroker.
Maybe a different wife,
maybe kids.

1047
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:05,814
You stack your paper,
but you say shit like,

1048
01:08:05,816 --> 01:08:07,849
"work hard, play harder,"
but you play
a little too hard.

1049
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:12,554
You rack up debt,
the type of debt that'd
make a white man blush.

1050
01:08:12,556 --> 01:08:13,988
Maybe you get into
a little trouble.

1051
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,890
Maybe you get your hand
caught in the corporate
cookie jar.

1052
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:17,392
Maybe you leave and
run off to the desert.

1053
01:08:17,394 --> 01:08:19,027
Maybe with your
favorite lap dancer in tow.

1054
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:21,596
Maybe you disappear
into a world consisting
of three things,

1055
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:26,034
money, sex, drugs and action.

1056
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:29,704
Oh, shit, that's four.

1057
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,474
Am I close?

1058
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:34,409
This how I look at it.

1059
01:08:34,411 --> 01:08:36,911
You guys just think
this is a trip.

1060
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:38,680
Either way,
if you are wall street,

1061
01:08:38,682 --> 01:08:42,317
you're a bigger fucking crook
than I could ever be.

1062
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:49,457
I'm gonna go right ahead
and speak for the two of us.

1063
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:56,664
You think you know us?
You don't.

1064
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:57,365
Mmm.

1065
01:08:57,367 --> 01:09:00,768
You think you're
the last word in crazy?

1066
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,338
You're not.

1067
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,406
And believe me
when I tell you,

1068
01:09:05,408 --> 01:09:08,576
you don't want to
see my buddy mad.

1069
01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:12,413
You haven't seen
how relentless he is.

1070
01:09:12,415 --> 01:09:13,848
Because when he sees red,

1071
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:19,087
you will
see nothing but black.

1072
01:09:23,093 --> 01:09:25,160
You hear that, speedy?
That's some Oscar
shit right there.

1073
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:27,762
That was nice.
Did you rehearse that?

1074
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:28,663
You see this shit, baby?

1075
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:34,302
See,
now this is a prime example
of a man who loves a woman.

1076
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,704
You guys are
perfect for each other.

1077
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,307
I mean that.

1078
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:45,213
Well,
what can I get you to eat?

1079
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:47,282
Get these cats
some happy meals,

1080
01:09:47,284 --> 01:09:49,918
and, uh, I'm gonna
take care of the bill,

1081
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,654
uh, "debora."

1082
01:09:52,656 --> 01:09:55,757
Yo, my friend here,
he, uh... he doesn't
like this place,

1083
01:09:55,759 --> 01:09:58,660
but I think this place
kind of nice, you know?

1084
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:00,728
So let me ask you something,
debora.

1085
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:07,869
What's his problem?

1086
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:12,840
Uh, maybe your friend
would like to fill out
a suggestion slip.

1087
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:15,543
Tell us how to
improve our service.

1088
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,820
Baby, you know that bitch?

1089
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:28,590
No.

1090
01:10:28,592 --> 01:10:30,592
Okay.

1091
01:10:30,594 --> 01:10:32,160
Let's bounce.

1092
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:34,028
I got this.

1093
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,631
What the fuck
is your problem?

1094
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:37,332
Hmm?

1095
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,342
Okay.

1096
01:10:47,344 --> 01:10:50,445
Well, make sure you
tip the nice lady.

1097
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,399
Bananas.

1098
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,601
"Bananas" is a code word.

1099
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:48,002
Whenever a deal is done
with one of my clients,

1100
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:51,506
they call me on the phone
and they say
the word "bananas,"

1101
01:11:51,508 --> 01:11:52,940
and then they hang up.

1102
01:11:54,244 --> 01:11:59,113
I did not hear
the word "bananas" tonight.

1103
01:11:59,115 --> 01:12:01,316
So you tell me who died.

1104
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:03,251
Well, your contacts
was cops, doc.

1105
01:12:03,253 --> 01:12:05,887
I know. They were my cops.

1106
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:08,356
Yeah, well,
they fired first.

1107
01:12:08,358 --> 01:12:09,891
And I'm not gonna
take a bullet for you

1108
01:12:09,893 --> 01:12:11,326
or nobody else
in this motherfucker.

1109
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:14,629
Is that true?
They fired first?

1110
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:17,699
Yeah.

1111
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:28,810
Baby?

1112
01:12:28,812 --> 01:12:30,645
Ask somebody on
the planet earth.

1113
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:33,881
I will ask
whoever the fuck I want.

1114
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:35,917
Go home, job's off.

1115
01:12:35,919 --> 01:12:37,719
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.
No. What the fuck?

1116
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:41,589
We are 24 hours from
being descended upon by
this entire city.

1117
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:42,824
Those pigs are in hog heaven.

1118
01:12:42,826 --> 01:12:44,826
The only way they can
ID us is with a ouija
board or some shit.

1119
01:12:44,828 --> 01:12:47,995
Well, your name only takes
four letters to spell out.

1120
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:51,132
Doc, bats ain't
my real fucking name.

1121
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:54,869
It's over, Leon.

1122
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:57,839
Get out of town.

1123
01:12:58,340 --> 01:12:59,841
Wow.

1124
01:12:59,843 --> 01:13:01,676
Well, I ain't running, doc.

1125
01:13:01,678 --> 01:13:05,480
I say we drive
into the storm.
Ride the hurricane.

1126
01:13:05,482 --> 01:13:07,215
We could be on
a non-extradition beach,

1127
01:13:07,217 --> 01:13:08,583
drinking
non-extradition cocktails,

1128
01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:11,853
counting our
non-extradition cash
in 23 hours.

1129
01:13:11,855 --> 01:13:13,955
And who do we get
to fence those money orders

1130
01:13:13,957 --> 01:13:16,290
since you shot the fence?

1131
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:17,392
Buddy got a guy.

1132
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:20,128
I mean, I'm just
taking a wild guess here,
but buddy got a guy.

1133
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:22,430
Ain't that right,
wall street?

1134
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,666
Yeah, I got a guy.

1135
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:28,035
So let's fucking do this.

1136
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:29,337
I only hear three voices,

1137
01:13:29,339 --> 01:13:32,707
and the last time I checked,
there's four in a car.

1138
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:34,308
Baby? Your call.

1139
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:35,910
Time to make
a big-boy decision.

1140
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:37,745
Do we do this thing or not?

1141
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,847
He's outvoted.
We doing it.

1142
01:13:39,849 --> 01:13:42,049
Let him speak.

1143
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:44,585
I say we all get some sleep.

1144
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:47,121
Get ready for
this fucking thing.

1145
01:14:05,809 --> 01:14:07,275
<i> Baby? Your call.</i>

1146
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:08,843
<i> Time to make</i>
<i> a big-boy decision.</i>

1147
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:10,978
<i> Do we do this thing or not?</i>

1148
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,847
<i> Do we do this thing or not?</i>

1149
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:14,449
<i> Do we do this thing or not?</i>

1150
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:18,986
<i> Do we do this thing or not?</i>
<i> Do we do this thing or not?</i>

1151
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,553
Where you going, baby?

1152
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:28,656
Uh, coffee.

1153
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:31,092
At 2:00 A.M.?

1154
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:33,327
That doesn't sound smart.

1155
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:35,196
You fucking kidding me?
I got enough on my plate,

1156
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:39,400
worrying about bats,
i got to worry
about you, too, now?

1157
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:41,002
You know what?
Do me a favor.

1158
01:15:41,004 --> 01:15:43,738
If you're gonna mail it in
at the post office tomorrow,

1159
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:49,577
then go on your
little caffeine run
and don't come back.

1160
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:52,213
If you're just in
this for the buzz,

1161
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:56,017
if driving is just some kind
of escape for you, then go.

1162
01:15:56,019 --> 01:16:00,488
What y'all doing in here?
Huh?

1163
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:03,057
Just making sure
everything's
ready for tomorrow.

1164
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:03,991
Oh, yeah.

1165
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:08,396
Well, uh, look like
he's going somewhere
at 2:00 in the morning.

1166
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:12,133
Are you?
No.

1167
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:15,603
Good. That's good.

1168
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:20,074
'Cause we got
to discuss this.

1169
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:22,643
No, no, it's the same one.

1170
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:25,313
<i> Baby? Your call.</i>

1171
01:16:25,315 --> 01:16:27,582
<i> Time to make</i>
<i> a big-boy decision.</i>

1172
01:16:27,584 --> 01:16:28,816
<i> Do we do this thing or not?</i>

1173
01:16:28,818 --> 01:16:31,819
Now, why you
want to go and do that?

1174
01:16:31,821 --> 01:16:35,122
It's just me fooling around.
I like to record stuff.

1175
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:38,492
Why you like to record stuff?

1176
01:16:38,494 --> 01:16:40,394
You the police?

1177
01:16:40,396 --> 01:16:42,496
Supposed to
squeal on the road,
not to the cops.

1178
01:16:42,498 --> 01:16:43,731
Speak up, baby.

1179
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:45,399
I... I like to listen
back to conversations.

1180
01:16:45,401 --> 01:16:51,105
I make music out of
the words, songs, mixes.
It's just something I do.

1181
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:53,474
That's one
fucking dumbass excuse.

1182
01:16:53,476 --> 01:16:56,744
To be fair, even the cops
couldn't come up
with an excuse

1183
01:16:56,746 --> 01:16:57,712
that fucking dumbass.

1184
01:16:57,714 --> 01:16:59,046
Now can you play us
one of your mixes?

1185
01:16:59,048 --> 01:17:00,982
I can't, they're...
They're just...
They're at home.

1186
01:17:00,984 --> 01:17:05,519
Well, it looks like
we're all going somewhere
at 2:00 in the morning, then.

1187
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:06,754
Come on.

1188
01:17:06,756 --> 01:17:08,956
I live really far away.

1189
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:11,258
No, you don't.

1190
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:16,097
Wake up, baby.

1191
01:17:16,099 --> 01:17:17,832
Time to explain.

1192
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:25,673
Joe.

1193
01:17:25,675 --> 01:17:27,241
Where is he?
What did you do to him?

1194
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:28,976
Oh, the cripple?

1195
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:31,545
Oh, don't worry about him.

1196
01:17:31,547 --> 01:17:34,415
He's good.
He ain't going nowhere.

1197
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:37,485
Why don't you play us
something, baby?

1198
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:08,082
This
shit is bananas, doc.

1199
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:11,719
B-a-n-a-n-a-s.

1200
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,261
<i> Hello? Hello, testing.</i>

1201
01:18:20,263 --> 01:18:23,597
<i> It's Debbie. Debora.</i>

1202
01:18:23,599 --> 01:18:26,067
<i> Yeah, except I'm d-e-b-o-r-a.</i>

1203
01:18:26,069 --> 01:18:29,904
"Debora."
Isn't that the waitress
from the diner?

1204
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:32,740
You said you
didn't know that bitch.

1205
01:18:32,742 --> 01:18:34,942
Why would you say
you didn't know her?

1206
01:18:34,944 --> 01:18:37,645
Have you been
talking to debora about us?

1207
01:18:37,647 --> 01:18:38,879
I don't say nothing.

1208
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:39,947
What about wheels?

1209
01:18:39,949 --> 01:18:41,048
He can't say nothing.

1210
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,551
Yeah, but he can
read motherfucking lips,
though, can't he?

1211
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:45,686
Take this fool
back to his shithole.

1212
01:18:45,688 --> 01:18:47,254
I'll find another
driver for tomorrow.

1213
01:18:47,256 --> 01:18:50,324
Doc, I'm available.
I can take him
where he needs to go,

1214
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:51,225

01:33:30,572 --> 01:33:31,805
How you two doing tonight?

1388
01:33:31,807 --> 01:33:35,875
We're doing just fine.
Ain't that right, baby?

1389
01:33:38,714 --> 01:33:40,480
Oh, god damn it!

1390
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:42,749
Oh, my gosh!
Come on.

1391
01:33:42,751 --> 01:33:44,384
Jesus Christ, man!
Come on. Let's go. Come on!

1392
01:33:44,386 --> 01:33:47,821
You can't
keep running, baby!

1393
01:33:47,823 --> 01:33:48,822
There's no escape!

1394
01:33:48,824 --> 01:33:51,157
Come on!
Let's get out of here!
Okay. Okay.

1395
01:33:51,159 --> 01:33:52,258
I will find you!

1396
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:53,627
Oh, fuck.

1397
01:33:53,629 --> 01:33:55,362
- Oh...
- Fuck!

1398
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:57,831
What's happening, baby?

1399
01:34:01,268 --> 01:34:02,402
I have to go.

1400
01:34:02,404 --> 01:34:04,938
No. I'm coming with you.

1401
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:06,840
- He just shot a guy!
- Who?

1402
01:34:06,842 --> 01:34:08,375
Him!

1403
01:34:09,043 --> 01:34:10,677
Atlanta police department!

1404
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:12,746
You on the ground,
are you okay?

1405
01:34:12,748 --> 01:34:14,981
Can you show me
where you've been shot?

1406
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:16,683
Yeah.

1407
01:34:17,953 --> 01:34:19,052
Right there.

1408
01:34:19,054 --> 01:34:20,987
<i> Officer down.</i>
<i> Shots fired.</i>

1409
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:23,323
<i> I repeat,</i>
<i> shots fired at Bo's diner.</i>

1410
01:34:23,325 --> 01:34:26,626
<i> Unit 412 currently on scene,</i>
<i> requesting backup.</i>

1411
01:34:26,628 --> 01:34:28,128
<i> Possible female hostage.</i>

1412
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:30,463
<i> All units in the vicinity</i>
<i> respond immediately...</i>

1413
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,999
<i> Who's this?</i>

1414
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:34,034
It's baby.

1415
01:34:34,036 --> 01:34:35,535
<i> Like I said, who's this?</i>

1416
01:34:35,537 --> 01:34:36,469
I need your help.

1417
01:34:36,471 --> 01:34:38,204
<i> I'm afraid this line is dead.</i>

1418
01:34:41,742 --> 01:34:44,744
Baby, we need
to get out of here.

1419
01:34:44,746 --> 01:34:46,246
I just need one thing first.

1420
01:34:46,248 --> 01:34:49,482
And then it's just us,
music and the road.

1421
01:34:49,484 --> 01:34:52,218
But we don't have a car.
Or music.

1422
01:34:57,992 --> 01:34:59,659
Yeah, we do.

1423
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:02,595
Get out.

1424
01:35:02,597 --> 01:35:04,230
Check out
Bonnie and Clyde, yo.

1425
01:35:04,232 --> 01:35:06,266
More like
Bonnie and Bonnie.

1426
01:35:06,268 --> 01:35:07,534
Get out of the car.

1427
01:35:07,536 --> 01:35:09,002
You holding?

1428
01:35:09,336 --> 01:35:11,871
You ever shot
a gun before, homie?

1429
01:35:12,006 --> 01:35:13,073
I just did.

1430
01:35:13,075 --> 01:35:15,075
Literally five minutes ago.

1431
01:35:25,886 --> 01:35:28,588
Can I at least get
my goddamn phone?

1432
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:29,255
No.

1433
01:36:03,792 --> 01:36:05,792
Not a chauffeur. Noted.

1434
01:36:16,303 --> 01:36:18,938
It's over, kid.
I ain't open.

1435
01:36:20,141 --> 01:36:21,474
I need those tapes.

1436
01:36:21,476 --> 01:36:23,943
I'm not giving you
those tapes.

1437
01:36:23,945 --> 01:36:27,714
I have the money orders.
I'll trade you for
one of those tapes.

1438
01:36:27,716 --> 01:36:29,983
I can't help you, baby.

1439
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:33,052
I shot buddy.
Congratulations.

1440
01:36:33,054 --> 01:36:36,823
Then you only
have every clean
and dirty cop after you.

1441
01:36:36,825 --> 01:36:38,591
You gonna shoot me, too?

1442
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:40,927
Never.
You and I are a team. I...

1443
01:36:40,929 --> 01:36:43,630
Don't feed me any more lines
from<i> monsters, inc.</i>

1444
01:36:43,632 --> 01:36:45,031
It pisses me off.

1445
01:36:45,033 --> 01:36:47,534
It's one of
samm's favorites.

1446
01:36:47,536 --> 01:36:51,271
I thought
it sounded familiar,
you little shit.

1447
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:57,177
I'm not your
lucky charm anymore.

1448
01:36:57,511 --> 01:37:01,114
But I'm standing here
asking for your help.

1449
01:37:01,615 --> 01:37:03,917
There's nothing
i can do for you, kid.

1450
01:37:03,919 --> 01:37:07,987
Why should I,
after what you've
done to me?

1451
01:37:12,893 --> 01:37:15,795
It's okay. Let's go.

1452
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:18,765
Oh, god damn it.

1453
01:37:19,099 --> 01:37:21,000
Look at the two of you.

1454
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:24,137
Okay,
go get your fucking tape.

1455
01:37:31,879 --> 01:37:35,615
It's going to take
more than a cassette
to get you two out of this,

1456
01:37:35,617 --> 01:37:37,684
because the news is all bad.

1457
01:37:37,686 --> 01:37:39,853
Well, there is
some good news.

1458
01:37:39,855 --> 01:37:41,154
The good news is
you like driving,

1459
01:37:41,156 --> 01:37:45,358
because you can't take
your foot off the gas
for the next 25 years.

1460
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,628
This should be enough
to get you across the border.

1461
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:49,929
From there, it's on you.

1462
01:37:49,931 --> 01:37:52,432
Don't trust
anyone but each other,

1463
01:37:52,434 --> 01:37:54,500
and don't ever look back.

1464
01:37:57,004 --> 01:37:59,272
I was in love once.

1465
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:05,378
Bananas.
Run.

1466
01:38:16,056 --> 01:38:17,624
I thought...

1467
01:38:24,131 --> 01:38:27,533
I thought I told you to run.

1468
01:38:31,639 --> 01:38:35,241
Go. I'll deal with the cops.

1469
01:38:35,509 --> 01:38:37,377
That's not the cops.

1470
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:40,513
<i> Here it is, baby.</i>

1471
01:38:40,515 --> 01:38:42,782
Your killer track.

1472
01:38:45,453 --> 01:38:47,086
Oh, fuck.

1473
01:39:03,204 --> 01:39:04,070
Move!

1474
01:39:25,993 --> 01:39:28,394
The bag! Get the bag!
Okay.

1475
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:16,642
Fuck!

1476
01:40:17,444 --> 01:40:19,679
We're getting out.
We're getting out?

1477
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:21,547
I have to end this.

1478
01:40:33,495 --> 01:40:36,396
Come on out now, baby.

1479
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,367
"Romeo, Romeo!

1480
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:44,937
<i> "Wherefore art thou Romeo?"</i>

1481
01:40:47,441 --> 01:40:49,709
Now!

1482
01:40:56,383 --> 01:40:58,284
Motherfucker!

1483
01:40:58,286 --> 01:41:01,354
<i> Be on the lookout</i>
<i> for squad car 3204,</i>

1484
01:41:01,356 --> 01:41:04,690
<i> believed to be stolen</i>
<i> by a Jason Van horn.</i>

1485
01:41:04,692 --> 01:41:09,595
Show yourself, baby!
You fucking child!

1486
01:41:09,863 --> 01:41:10,897
Hey, you okay, buddy?

1487
01:41:10,899 --> 01:41:13,599
<i> He is armed</i>
<i> and extremely dangerous.</i>

1488
01:41:13,601 --> 01:41:15,201
Fuck! Jesus!
He shot me!

1489
01:41:15,203 --> 01:41:18,538
Assistance!
Assistance, please!

1490
01:41:40,694 --> 01:41:42,595
Fuck you, buddy.

1491
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:55,808
Shit, shit, shit!

1492
01:42:21,034 --> 01:42:22,168
Baby!

1493
01:42:22,170 --> 01:42:23,970
You did good, kid.

1494
01:42:23,972 --> 01:42:27,707
But you took something
away from me that I love.

1495
01:42:28,342 --> 01:42:30,543
You know
i got to do the same.

1496
01:42:37,352 --> 01:42:40,319
I really wish
you could hear her scream.

1497
01:42:44,691 --> 01:42:47,393
Guess you'll
just have to watch.

1498
01:43:25,232 --> 01:43:27,366
Baby.

1499
01:43:43,884 --> 01:43:45,418
What are you doing?

1500
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:49,388
Hitting the road.
Listening to music.

1501
01:43:49,823 --> 01:43:52,592
Is this really your mom?

1502
01:43:55,195 --> 01:43:57,230
Yeah.

1503
01:43:57,232 --> 01:44:00,233
She has a beautiful voice.

1504
01:44:02,169 --> 01:44:04,437
I know.

1505
01:44:41,042 --> 01:44:44,977
<i> This is an active scene.</i>
<i> Hold all positions.</i>

1506
01:45:16,210 --> 01:45:19,178
You don't
belong in this world.

1507
01:45:22,350 --> 01:45:23,716
No.

1508
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:52,178
Hands behind your back!

1509
01:45:55,549 --> 01:45:56,882
Do not move!

1510
01:45:56,884 --> 01:45:58,651
I'm sorry.

1511
01:46:05,058 --> 01:46:08,694
Please, leave him alone!

1512
01:46:09,964 --> 01:46:15,668
<i> How would you</i>
<i> describe your relationship</i>
<i> with the defendant?</i>

1513
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:16,669
<i> We were friends.</i>

1514
01:46:16,671 --> 01:46:20,139
<i> And I think we both wanted</i>
<i> to be more than that.</i>

1515
01:46:20,141 --> 01:46:22,408
<i> He got himself</i>
<i> into a bad spot.</i>

1516
01:46:22,410 --> 01:46:24,443
<i> I was just</i>
<i> trying to get him out.</i>

1517
01:46:24,445 --> 01:46:27,213
I believe the defendant
is of good character.

1518
01:46:27,215 --> 01:46:29,882
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

1519
01:46:29,884 --> 01:46:32,418
<i> Was the strangest thing.</i>

1520
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:35,154
<i> He finally drove off,</i>

1521
01:46:35,156 --> 01:46:38,391
and he threw
my purse right at me.

1522
01:46:38,393 --> 01:46:41,460
<i> Then he actually said,</i>
<i> "I'm sorry."</i>

1523
01:46:41,462 --> 01:46:43,829
<i> He looked at me and</i>
<i> he shook his head,</i>

1524
01:46:43,831 --> 01:46:47,032
like he was warning me,
somehow telling me
not to go inside.

1525
01:46:47,034 --> 01:46:50,703
<i> He looked concerned,</i>
<i> like he was,</i>
<i> uh, trying to save me.</i>

1526
01:46:50,705 --> 01:46:53,639
<i> He made a mistake</i>
<i>when he was younger,</i>

1527
01:46:53,641 --> 01:46:55,541
<i> and it's haunted him</i>
<i> ever since.</i>

1528
01:46:55,543 --> 01:46:59,445
<i> When he tried to get out,</i>
<i> he was pressured even harder.</i>

1529
01:46:59,447 --> 01:47:03,983
It was never his fault.
He's got a good heart.

1530
01:47:03,985 --> 01:47:07,153
<i> Always had. Always will.</i>

1531
01:47:07,155 --> 01:47:10,456
<i> With regard to</i>
<i> counts 1 through 19,</i>

1532
01:47:10,458 --> 01:47:12,258
and count 21,

1533
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:14,293
I hereby
sentence the defendant

1534
01:47:14,295 --> 01:47:16,495
to 25 years in
the federal penitentiary,

1535
01:47:16,497 --> 01:47:21,600
subject to a parole hearing
after five years served.

1536
01:47:35,849 --> 01:47:38,651
You got a letter, kid.

1537
01:47:41,154 --> 01:47:42,855
<i> Hey, baby.</i>

1538
01:47:42,857 --> 01:47:43,889
<i> You know, it's funny.</i>

1539
01:47:43,891 --> 01:47:46,025
<i> Even though I heard it</i>
<i> so many times in</i>
<i> the court case,</i>

1540
01:47:46,027 --> 01:47:52,531
<i> I still can't get</i>
<i> used to the fact</i>
<i> that your real name is miles.</i>

1541
01:47:52,533 --> 01:47:54,500
<i> It's a cool name, though.</i>

1542
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:57,603
<i> I can think of a lot</i>
<i> of great miles songs.</i>

1543
01:47:57,605 --> 01:48:02,208
<i> But we still</i>
<i> have to get through</i>
<i> all those baby songs first.</i>

1544
01:48:02,210 --> 01:48:05,811
<i> I can't wait until</i>
<i> the day when it's just us,</i>

1545
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:09,181
<i> music and the road.</i>

1546
01:48:09,649 --> 01:48:11,550
<i> See you later, baby.</i>

1547
01:48:11,552 --> 01:48:14,753
<i> All my love, debora.</i>

1548
01:51:53,741 --> 01:51:55,174
<i> He's a...</i>
<i> He's a... he's a good kid</i>
