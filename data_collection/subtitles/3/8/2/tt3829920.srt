1
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:35,279
Hey, it's Marsh.

2
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:37,779
Mmm-hmm.

3
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,650
Mmm-hmm.

4
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,752
Hmm.

5
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:43,920
Okay.

6
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,212
When are you just gonna give
up on that thing and get a new one?

7
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:50,080
Well, you know me.

8
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:51,581
Love a lost cause.

9
00:02:52,749 --> 00:02:54,784
Where are you off to?

10
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:58,088
Oh, new start down at
Tonto National Forest.

11
00:02:58,089 --> 00:03:00,091
Ate up 40,000 acres yesterday.

12
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:01,663
Fixing to triple that today.

13
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:07,867
You got something to say to me
before you walk out that door?

14
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:12,235
Well, I guess I said some shit
last night I shouldn't have.

15
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:12,749
Yeah. You did.

16
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:17,007
Why?

17
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:18,008
Because.

18
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:20,310
Because what?

19
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,881
'Cause you're smarter than I am,
especially when we squabble.

20
00:03:25,882 --> 00:03:28,449
And it pisses me off.

21
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,253
Well, I can appreciate that.

22
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,757
I bet you can.

23
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:37,225
I guess we both made
some mistakes last night.

24
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:38,629
Yes, we did.

25
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,398
Let's make better
ones next time.

26
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:44,702
Okay.

27
00:03:46,702 --> 00:03:48,370
God, I love you,
Manda-bear.

28
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,842
I love you, too, Shortstop.

00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:56,578

Bla-blow wants to go with you.

00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:48,925
Bla-blow wants
to go with me?

43
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:50,328
Crazy little guy.
Come here.

44
00:04:52,496 --> 00:04:54,026
- Can you take this little stinker?
- Yeah.

45
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,170
He's not a stinker.

46
00:04:55,332 --> 00:04:57,092
- No, you're a stinker.
- No, I'm not.

47
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:58,300
Mmm-hmm.

48
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,669
She's a stinker.

49
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,136
Bye. Say bye.

50
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:02,777
Bla-blow says good-bye.

51
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,741
Put me down. Put me down.

00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:07,148
Oh, boy.

53
00:05:11,148 --> 00:05:12,614
Go, Mack!
Come on, buddy.

54
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:13,615
Get that can, would you?

55
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:20,488
Just 'cause you got
a crack in your ass

56
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:22,727
don't make you a cripple,
Jesse. You get it.

57
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,859
Air Attack Helicopter
741 en route with a full tank.

58
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,061
Crew 7, can we get
a ground fix on the fire?

59
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,730
Helicopter 741, this is Crew 7.

60
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:09,100
Fire's running north-northwest
two miles out from our location.

61
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:10,775
Copy that,
Crew 7. Thank you.

62
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,019
Confirmed.
Clear to drop.

63
00:06:27,018 --> 00:06:28,886
Good work, 741.

64
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,391
Copy that.

65
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,040
You saw men, take five!

66
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,373
Bravo Squad, take five!

67
00:06:51,374 --> 00:06:52,607
Powwow?

68
00:06:52,608 --> 00:06:53,608
Breaky.

69
00:06:54,577 --> 00:06:56,210
Yo!

70
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:57,649
Huddle up!

71
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,182
- Hey, agua me.
- Yeah.

72
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:02,183
Alpha!

73
00:07:02,284 --> 00:07:03,785
I've got to throw
a new on the saw!

74
00:07:03,786 --> 00:07:04,786
Rosie.

75
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,757
Chaw.

76
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:08,757
Hot sauce.

77
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:09,957
You look like a bag

78
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,993
of smashed assholes right now.
You all right?

79
00:07:11,994 --> 00:07:14,661
I had a crazy night, bro.

80
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:16,273
I finally hooked up
with that gal Cheyanne.

81
00:07:16,297 --> 00:07:17,297
- Yes!
- Cheyanne?

82
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:21,836
The Cheyanne? The girl from the Emporium
with the tattoos and the beautiful eyes?

83
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:23,404
- That's the one.
- Outstanding.

84
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:24,885
What's up? Dude, Whitted,

85
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:27,217
Mack closed that girl
from the Emporium last night.

86
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:27,871
Cheyanne?

87
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:28,641
Yeah.

88
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:30,511
I see her at church now
and again. She doesn't talk.

89
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:31,812
Yeah, she doesn't
need to though, right?

90
00:07:31,813 --> 00:07:32,512
I mean, like, unreal.

91
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:33,045
Hey, guys.

92
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:35,716
Guys, guys!
The man is clearly an artist.

93
00:07:35,717 --> 00:07:38,050
Let him share his gift.
MacKenzie, proceed.

94
00:07:39,385 --> 00:07:41,854
I mean, she went
full-blown medieval on me.

95
00:07:41,855 --> 00:07:43,135
I had to buckle in at one point.

96
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,570
- Oh, God.
- I want to buckle in.

97
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,126
I mean, there was just one thing that
she said that just threw me, though.

98
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:48,881
Don't worry about it.

99
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:49,994
What? Dude, you can't say

100
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:51,496
there's something and then
"Don't worry about it."

101
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:51,864
What was it?

102
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:52,965
All right, all right, all right.

103
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:55,633
Postcoital, we're laying
in bed. I grab the remote.

104
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:57,536
Okay? I turn the TV on. I'm
flipping through the channel.

105
00:07:57,537 --> 00:07:58,616
I end up on an infomercial.

106
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:03,742
In the background...
there's Mount Rushmore.

107
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:05,644
And I'm trying to make
conversation at this point.

108
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:06,211
It's awkward.

109
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,211
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

110
00:08:07,212 --> 00:08:09,038
And I'm like, "Wow,
that's amazing."

111
00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:09,646
Right.

112
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:11,749
Her rebuttal to this?

113
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,355
"Especially when you realize
it's a natural thing."

114
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:18,355
What? What?

115
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:19,823
Oh, that's not good.

116
00:08:19,824 --> 00:08:20,249
What?

117
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:21,525
You mean to tell me

118
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:24,128
that this girl believes that the
faces of our four presidents

119
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,231
showed up on a mountain
through the process of...

120
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:28,377
natural erosion?

121
00:08:28,402 --> 00:08:29,165
Yeah!

122
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,725
Wind and rain
carved out the presidents.

123
00:08:31,234 --> 00:08:32,538
Many forms of
intelligence, Mack.

124
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:33,536
I love wind and rain!

125
00:08:33,537 --> 00:08:34,082
Oh, my God.

126
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:35,371
Hey, honestly, Mack,

127
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:36,839
this girl is perfect
for you, man.

128
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,040
She's like a match
made in heaven.

129
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:38,869
I'm proud of you.

130
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:39,941
I haven't slept.

131
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:41,486
Whitted, where you at?

132
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,179
Whoo!

133
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,748
We got a chain left
to finish the mop-up.

134
00:08:45,749 --> 00:08:47,381
All right, just get it done.

135
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:48,849
Aye, aye, Papa.

136
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,952
All right, boys, back to work.

137
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:54,555
Jesse!

138
00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:55,622
Yeah, Supe!

139
00:08:55,623 --> 00:08:56,623
I'm gonna go scout ahead!

140
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:58,025
You got it!

141
00:08:58,026 --> 00:08:59,696
Tree coming down!

142
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:01,696
Falling!

143
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:08,501
This showcase
is gonna burn, baby, burn!

144
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:10,537
Nicole, welcome to the showcase!

145
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:12,206
Zachariah,
welcome to the showcase!

146
00:09:12,207 --> 00:09:13,941
Guys, pay close attention
to the first showcase,

147
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:15,576
because it could go to
either one of you. Here we go.

148
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:16,577
Good luck.

149
00:09:17,746 --> 00:09:19,945
This five-station
home gym centers around

150
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:21,780
a fully adjustable
weight set to help...

151
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:24,951
I can't read that shit.
What's it say?

152
00:09:24,952 --> 00:09:26,418
From Hatch.

153
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:29,790
"Saw Natalie working
Murph's last night.

154
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,996
"Did you know she was pregnant?"

155
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:39,898
Who's Natalie?

156
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,435
Some chick I rolled with
a couple months back.

157
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:46,171
Some rubber in your new car!

158
00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:52,846
What are you doing?

159
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:57,115
What are you up to?

160
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:07,592
Yeah.

161
00:10:07,593 --> 00:10:09,227
Bless your little black heart.

162
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:11,895
What's up, Supe?

163
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:14,930
The fire's gonna do
a 180 off the line.

164
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:17,102
Division Charlie, it's Crew 7.

165
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:20,069
Go ahead, Crew 7.

166
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,141
Yeah, I think the fire's gonna go
toward homes to the southwest.

167
00:10:24,142 --> 00:10:25,807
What we'd like to do
is take my crew down

168
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:28,410
to the eastern edge of
the creek and prep for a burn.

169
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:31,612
Negative. We've got an inbound
hotshot crew to your division.

170
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:33,650
They'll make the call.

171
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,718
Copy that.

172
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:38,353
Goddamn it.

173
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,123
How y'all doin'?

174
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:43,524
Eric Marsh, Crew 7.

175
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:45,527
My captain, Jesse Steed.

176
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:47,894
Well, this fire's
gonna shift down here.

177
00:10:47,895 --> 00:10:51,466
I figured you and your crew should go
down and prep that creek for a burn.

178
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:53,701
I don't mean any disrespect
to you California boys,

179
00:10:53,702 --> 00:10:56,870
but I was... Just been watching
this line for a few days now.

180
00:10:56,871 --> 00:11:00,507
The fire's gonna shift, probably jump over
to that neighborhood right over there.

181
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:02,676
Okay, let me stop you right
there, okay? Marsh, is it?

182
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:03,339
Yeah, it's Marsh.

183
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:04,364
Yeah, well... Um...

184
00:11:05,312 --> 00:11:08,447
You guys are Type 2,
and we are hotshots.

185
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:10,816
So, why don't you do
what deucers do best,

186
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:14,128
which is stay in the back
and mop up our shit?

187
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:23,002
Ladies.

188
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:31,282
Maricopa County Sheriff's Office!

189
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:32,917
This is a mandatory evacuation!

190
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:35,242
Get in, Trevor!

191
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,001
- Hey, Supe.
- Yeah.

192
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:46,184
You're not gonna like this one.

193
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:48,051
Smith and Landau are
cutting bait on us.

194
00:11:48,052 --> 00:11:50,886
What? God.

195
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:53,023
A few slots opened up
on the Blue River Hotshots,

196
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:55,058
and Ferguson's rolling out
the red carpet.

197
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,861
Well, Blue River's a good crew.
Ferguson's a solid Supe.

198
00:11:57,862 --> 00:12:00,197
They'll probably make double
what we gave 'em.

199
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:01,838
We could've saved
all these people's homes

200
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:04,145
- if we ran the play that you called.
- Mmm-hmm.

201
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:05,869
The boys are pissed.

202
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,870
So am I.

203
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,379
Hey, Sturgill.

204
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,882
Amanda.

205
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:22,883
Where'd you find this one?

206
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:24,686
Tweaker lab outside of town.

207
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:26,183
You arrest the guys that did it?

208
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,089
Didn't need to.

209
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,391
Dipshits blew themselves up
mixing a batch.

210
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:30,691
Good.

211
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:34,695
Attaboy.
There you go.

212
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:37,064
We were gonna put him down,
but then Steinbrink said

213
00:12:37,065 --> 00:12:38,181
we should call you.

214
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:41,262
So, what do you think?

215
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:11,433
You're safe now.

216
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:14,751
I promise.

217
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:39,327
You're all right.

218
00:13:43,326 --> 00:13:45,527
Lie down.

219
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:47,940
Good boy. Lie down.
Come on. Lie down.

220
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:19,161
Who's this?

221
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:22,199
New friend.

222
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:26,906
Your friend got a name?

223
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:32,405
Roscoe.

224
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:33,745
Roscoe.

225
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,683
You're dirty.

226
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:43,751
You're filthy.

227
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,751
You smell.

228
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:46,860
So do you.

229
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,820
I've been thinking about inviting
over some ranchers from the area,

230
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:01,437
showing them the benefits of
having the horses go barefoot.

231
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,274
Maybe I can drum up
some new clients.

232
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:11,745
I'm pregnant with triplets.

233
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,749
Willie Nelson is the father.

234
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,684
I like Willie Nelson.

235
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:24,390
Well, that's good.

236
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,190
I'm sorry.

237
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:28,858
It's just some shit
happened out on the line.

238
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:30,796
Yeah. Shit always
happens on the line.

239
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:34,865
You want to talk about it?

240
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:36,566
Or you want to do
your John Wayne thing?

241
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,366
There's nothing to talk about.

242
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,872
Same problem.
It's just getting worse.

243
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:46,780
Have you reached out to Duane?

244
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,915
Well,

245
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:54,950
maybe...

246
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:57,625
He can help you
get the crew certified.

247
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,625
Hmm.

248
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:04,633
What?

249
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:09,596
What?

250
00:16:09,597 --> 00:16:11,165
Why are you so good to me?

251
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,633
Hell if I know.

252
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:19,116
Bye, have a nice night.

253
00:16:19,141 --> 00:16:20,299
Thank you so much.

254
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:22,643
Hey.

255
00:16:33,653 --> 00:16:36,189
Yes, it's yours, I'm sure.

256
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,995
Damn.

257
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:43,834
Uh, all right, how long
have you been pregnant?

258
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:44,783
Five months.

259
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:46,324
Five months? Are you serious?

260
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,244
Dude, you're not even gonna tell me,
maybe earlier or something?

261
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:50,803
Brendan, 'cause I don't
wanna hear it. I don't.

262
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:52,404
Well, look, I deserve
a say in all this.

263
00:16:52,405 --> 00:16:53,255
Okay, then what
do you wanna say?

264
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,905
I called you, I've...

265
00:16:53,906 --> 00:16:55,708
Say something!

266
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:56,709
I don't know.

267
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,842
You don't care about me.

268
00:16:57,843 --> 00:17:00,177
You never did.
You broke up with me with a text.

269
00:17:00,178 --> 00:17:01,846
Yeah, I know.
Look, I didn't know.

270
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:03,179
Yeah, and what if you did?

271
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,414
What would you have done?

272
00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:05,418
Marry me?

273
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:08,418
All right.

274
00:17:09,355 --> 00:17:11,888
Look, that is part mine, okay?

275
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:13,757
It is. So...

276
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:16,359
I'm gonna be responsible for it.

277
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,896
You're not responsible
for anything.

278
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:21,336
My family and I
have this on our own.

279
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,335
I want you to stay away.

280
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,141
If that's what you want.

281
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:33,875
Damn.

282
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:40,225
We catch you doing that shit in here
again and we'll make you choke on it.

283
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:43,020
Asswipe.

284
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,421
Shit, B.

285
00:17:45,422 --> 00:17:46,991
You okay?

286
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:25,390
I've been dreaming of this.

287
00:18:25,391 --> 00:18:27,560
The day you bring me
up here to the point.

288
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:29,128
Oh, God, would you stop?

289
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,701
What the hell are we doing here?

290
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:36,803
Take a good hard look out there.

291
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:38,803
What do you see?

292
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:41,607
Fuel.

293
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:44,877
Lot of good folks lost
their home down at Cave Creek.

294
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:46,378
Bitch kicked your ass, huh?

295
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:47,544
Mmm-hmm.

296
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:50,483
But had I been able to cut and burn
the lawn, we could've kicked hers.

297
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:52,916
Tough beat.

298
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:54,917
We've been training
for over four years.

299
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:58,755
We've got all our hours,
all our qualifications,

300
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:00,824
can out-hump any
hotshot crew out there,

301
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:03,493
but until we're certified, we ain't
nothing but a bunch of deucers.

302
00:19:03,494 --> 00:19:04,894
We can't do anything.
Can't do shit.

303
00:19:05,263 --> 00:19:09,331
Well, I told you
it wouldn't be easy.

304
00:19:09,332 --> 00:19:12,167
Doing something that's never
been done before takes time.

305
00:19:12,168 --> 00:19:15,538
You know I lost two more
good dudes to Blue River?

306
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,642
City council and mayor have got
my ass on the chopping block.

307
00:19:18,643 --> 00:19:20,376
We ain't got any more time.

308
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:22,011
Neither does our hometown.

309
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:24,378
Sooner or later, the fire,
she's gonna come a-knockin',

310
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:27,116
and when she does, this whole place
is gonna go off like a powder keg.

311
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:30,652
And when she does, my crew won't even
be able to set foot on the line.

312
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:33,120
Eric, that attitude
that you got right there,

313
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:35,041
that cost you a lot of friends
in the department.

314
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:35,572
I don't care.

315
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:36,757
Friends that could've helped.

316
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:43,163
Come on, Duane, you're
the Wildland fire chief.

317
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:45,133
You started this thing.

318
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:46,134
Well...

319
00:19:49,704 --> 00:19:51,048
I need your help.

320
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:02,047
Please?

321
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:03,916
Hey. Now, that's nice.

322
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:05,922
That's a good start.

323
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:09,891
Come on, we'll get this thing.

324
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:12,528
Look, listen, I'm in...

325
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:14,967
Camp Verde Jail.

326
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:17,595
And, uh...

327
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:21,333
Nah, it was just, like, a
misunderstanding, or whatever, honestly.

328
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:23,768
But the bail's, like,
a grand, so I was...

329
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:25,504
I was seeing if you
could post that.

330
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
Hello?

331
00:20:30,374 --> 00:20:32,477
Mom?

332
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:37,481
Now, there are two things
that'll make the mayor move.

333
00:20:37,482 --> 00:20:38,982
Sorry, baby.

334
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:40,718
Fear and greed, right?

335
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:44,421
Yeah, but until the fire's knocking
at his door, we don't have the fear.

336
00:20:44,422 --> 00:20:48,891
Yeah, once the crew gets certified
as hotshot, then the city,

337
00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:52,329
they can charge 49 bucks
an hour per man

338
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,364
when they're working a fire on
federal or state land, right?

339
00:20:55,365 --> 00:20:57,333
This is bringing money
into Prescott.

340
00:20:57,334 --> 00:21:00,469
Wait, don't they have to get
evaluated so they can get certified?

341
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,937
I'm gonna get them
their evaluation.

342
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:05,941
Now, if you're willing
to commit your boys

343
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:08,703
to working more than what the average
hotshot crew covers in a season,

344
00:21:09,213 --> 00:21:11,046
I'm talking about
a lot of overtime, now...

345
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:12,207
Yeah, it's no problem.

346
00:21:12,282 --> 00:21:14,716
We'll work the full
fire season, no breaks.

347
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:17,586
I'm so sorry.

348
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:19,754
You okay?

349
00:21:19,755 --> 00:21:21,056
Yes, thank you.

350
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:36,771
It's not easy sharing your man
with a fire. I know.

351
00:21:36,772 --> 00:21:39,040
I'm just being a baby.

352
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,074
You know, I don't even know why,

353
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:44,378
when I went into this
with my eyes wide open.

354
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:46,949
Doesn't mean you can see
everything that's coming.

355
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:50,449
It's important to him.

356
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,653
I'll make it work.

357
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:53,653
Hey. Just one.

358
00:21:54,754 --> 00:21:57,232
Well, at least you don't have kids
and grandkids to worry about.

359
00:21:57,256 --> 00:21:58,471
Right.

360
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,342
...Sunday, 8:00 p.m.
Temperatures 115 to 122...

361
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,548
I don't wanna talk about it.

362
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:25,885
Yeah? Neither do I, Brendan.

363
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:27,885
What is this?

364
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:29,019
I'll be home at 7:00.

365
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,924
When I get back,
I want you gone.

366
00:22:33,924 --> 00:22:35,768
Dude, are you serious?

367
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:46,870
Dude, what... Oh, my God.

368
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,806
You boys been
beating me off with this scheme

369
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:54,876
for the last three years, and the city
still hasn't made a damn dime yet.

370
00:22:54,877 --> 00:22:56,879
Huck, you saw the numbers.

371
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,614
This crew, it's a real moneymaker
once they get certified.

372
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:02,551
Well, when's that gonna be?

373
00:23:02,552 --> 00:23:05,520
As I understand it, they've done all
the time and obligations needed.

374
00:23:05,521 --> 00:23:08,055
This is the first city
to ever start its own crew,

375
00:23:08,056 --> 00:23:11,692
so the Feds see us as outsiders, like a
threat to their way of doing things.

376
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:13,892
They're trying to put us off
by stalling our evaluation.

377
00:23:14,196 --> 00:23:14,740
That's right.

378
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:16,162
Look, the people of Prescott

379
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:19,167
don't understand why they're
paying for their own hotshot crew.

380
00:23:19,168 --> 00:23:21,669
And the city council, well,
they think it's overkill,

381
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,072
like having a SEAL Team Six
do the job of a sheriff.

382
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:27,177
The Rodeo Fire, it torched the rim above
Payson before they could get on it.

383
00:23:28,177 --> 00:23:30,444
The Indian Fire burned
right up to our doorstep.

384
00:23:30,445 --> 00:23:32,885
It's only a matter of time before
Prescott is gonna be dealing

385
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:34,848
with a massive wildfire.

386
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:35,849
That's right.

387
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,850
And when it comes,

388
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:39,585
the people living here, they're gonna be
thanking their bold, long-sighted mayor

389
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,421
that they've got their very
own SEAL Team Six of hotshots

390
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:43,495
to put it down quick.

391
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:49,762
Are the Rusty Pistols gonna
play at the rodeo this year?

392
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:52,732
Oh! Wouldn't have it
any other way.

393
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:54,933
Are you gonna ride that big old
mule of yours to the show?

394
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:55,647
Oh, shit, yeah.

395
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:04,007
You got to the end of the season to
get yourself evaluated and certified.

396
00:24:04,008 --> 00:24:06,043
And you got next season
to prove your worth.

397
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,881
But it's all on you, Duane.

398
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,448
Appreciate this, Mayor.

399
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,545
You will not regret this, sir.

400
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:13,384
Well, I hope not.

401
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,122
Now, you boys
keep your powder dry.

402
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:17,715
Thank you.

403
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,517
Hey, Dave. Good to see you.

404
00:24:22,493 --> 00:24:25,829
That's our mayor.

405
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,664
Hey, Brendan.

406
00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:30,767
Your daughter Michaela was born
six minutes ago. Congrats.

407
00:24:30,768 --> 00:24:32,402
She's totally healthy?

408
00:24:32,403 --> 00:24:33,834
Nothing wrong with
her or nothing?

409
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:34,858
No, she's perfect.

410
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:38,273
How's the mom doing?

411
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:39,809
She's all good.

412
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,377
Now, listen, they're gonna put the
baby in the nursery in a little while

413
00:24:42,378 --> 00:24:43,780
so mom can rest.

414
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:44,781
I'll come get you, okay?

415
00:24:45,214 --> 00:24:45,965
Yeah. All right.

416
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,715
All right.

417
00:24:46,716 --> 00:24:47,378
Thanks, man.

418
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,403
Yeah.

419
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,529
Wade Scott Parker.

420
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,498
So, your father's a captain
on Chino Valley Fire?

421
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:04,053
Yes, sir.

422
00:25:04,078 --> 00:25:05,078
Huh.

423
00:25:06,668 --> 00:25:08,145
So I'm assuming you
know the difference

424
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:10,169
between structure and
wildland fighting operations.

425
00:25:10,271 --> 00:25:11,439
I do.

426
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,209
Um, wildland firefighters,
they dig line,

427
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:17,810
they cut trees, light
backburns to corral the fire.

428
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:18,811
They try to control it.

429
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:19,814
Yep.

430
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:21,785
We fight fire with fire.

431
00:25:23,784 --> 00:25:25,451
What does the word
"integrity" mean to you?

432
00:25:25,452 --> 00:25:27,787
For shit's sake, Jesse, can we
please get to the good questions?

433
00:25:27,788 --> 00:25:28,795
What? Okay.

434
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:35,828
When was the last time you lied?

435
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:38,199
Um, I... I guess
to my mom, this morning.

436
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:40,865
About what?

437
00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:43,768
I told her that this job isn't as
dangerous as working structure.

438
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:45,637
Are you lying to me right now?

439
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:46,971
No, sir.

440
00:25:46,972 --> 00:25:48,472
You a short-timer?

441
00:25:48,473 --> 00:25:49,507
A what, sir?

442
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:51,343
A firefighter's son
looking to use my crew

443
00:25:51,344 --> 00:25:53,945
as a stepping stone to a gig
on the structure side.

444
00:25:53,946 --> 00:25:54,363
No, sir.

445
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:55,613
Now, you'd better not be,

446
00:25:55,614 --> 00:25:57,881
'cause if there's one thing
I can't stand, it's that.

447
00:25:57,882 --> 00:25:58,882
Yes, sir.

448
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,519
You got any running gear?

449
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:04,321
I do, sir. In the car.

450
00:26:05,224 --> 00:26:07,458
All right, we're gonna go for a little
hike in a bit, me and the boys.

451
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:08,939
Come along, we'll
give you a look-see.

452
00:26:09,593 --> 00:26:10,593
Thank you, sir.

453
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:16,265
Why are you still here?

454
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:17,945
Sorry, sir.

455
00:26:27,945 --> 00:26:29,512
I like him.

456
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:40,621
Ah, nice shot!

457
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:41,675
One point.

458
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,024
One point for these guys.

Serious burnout.

00:27:14,722 --> 00:27:15,702
What's he doing here?

471
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:16,589
I don't know.

472
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,596
Let's find out, shall we?

473
00:27:22,596 --> 00:27:23,596
Brian, right?

474
00:27:23,597 --> 00:27:24,663
It's Brendan.

475
00:27:24,664 --> 00:27:25,998
Right.

476
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:27,400
You were in my EMT class.

477
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,569
What's up? You...

478
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:32,104
You lost, or...

479
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:33,805
No, I was just checking.

480
00:27:33,806 --> 00:27:35,846
You know, I heard you guys
had some slots available.

481
00:27:42,447 --> 00:27:44,082
Slots are all filled, man.

482
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,086
Sorry, dude.

483
00:27:47,086 --> 00:27:48,586
All right. Thanks, man.

484
00:27:48,587 --> 00:27:49,921
Yeah.

485
00:27:49,922 --> 00:27:51,287
Hey.

486
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:53,826
We got one slot open.
You want to interview for it?

487
00:27:54,826 --> 00:27:55,826
Yeah. Right now?

488
00:27:56,661 --> 00:27:58,096
Yeah, right now.

489
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:00,938
All right.

490
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:09,272
I'm Eric Marsh,
superintendent of Crew 7.

491
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,352
Brendan McDonough.

492
00:28:22,352 --> 00:28:24,825
When was the last time you used?

493
00:28:28,825 --> 00:28:30,361
Don't think, just
answer the question.

494
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:33,900
Three months ago.

495
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,969
Ever use needles?

496
00:28:37,994 --> 00:28:38,994
No.

497
00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:40,534
Never.

498
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:48,545
Do you have your qualifications?

499
00:28:49,545 --> 00:28:51,111
Yeah. Uh...

500
00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:55,849
Wildland fire, fire science,
and just completed my EMT.

501
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:59,386
You know the difference between
Type 2 crew and Type 1 IHC?

502
00:28:59,387 --> 00:29:01,320
Yes, sir. Hotshots are
on the front line,

503
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:02,921
and they get to
engage the fire directly.

504
00:29:04,726 --> 00:29:05,726
Good.

505
00:29:08,696 --> 00:29:09,696
You got a record?

506
00:29:11,198 --> 00:29:12,497
Yeah.

507
00:29:12,498 --> 00:29:13,498
- Felony larceny.
- Hmm.

508
00:29:15,368 --> 00:29:16,368
You ever do any time?

509
00:29:18,205 --> 00:29:19,705
Three days.

510
00:29:19,706 --> 00:29:22,914
And I'm on probation right now.

511
00:29:27,914 --> 00:29:29,451
What are you doing here?

512
00:29:32,451 --> 00:29:35,086
I made a lot of
mistakes in my life,

513
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:38,022
and I've done a lot of things
that I'm ashamed of

514
00:29:38,023 --> 00:29:41,596
and I'm embarrassed by,
honestly, but...

515
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:45,761
I just had a daughter...

516
00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:47,933
Her name's Michaela

517
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:51,206
and I just really wanna
give her what I never had.

518
00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:58,454
If you give me a chance,
I won't let you down.

519
00:30:10,453 --> 00:30:12,090
Okay.

520
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,892
All right. The crew's
gonna go on a little hike.

521
00:30:16,893 --> 00:30:18,559
You got any running gear?

522
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,928
Uh... No.

523
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:21,295
What size shoe do you wear?

524
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:22,296
Ten.

525
00:30:22,297 --> 00:30:23,568
Hand 'em over.

526
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:26,928
They're... They're
brand-new, Supe.

527
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:29,136
Yeah, I don't give a shit.
Hand 'em over.

528
00:30:29,137 --> 00:30:30,808
McDonough!

529
00:30:32,808 --> 00:30:33,807
Come on.

530
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:38,778
Come on.

531
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:40,815
They're... They're
limited edition, sir.

532
00:30:40,816 --> 00:30:41,816
Yeah? Okay.

533
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,986
There you go.

534
00:30:44,986 --> 00:30:46,825
Thanks, man.

535
00:30:50,824 --> 00:30:51,959
Are those limited edition?

536
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:52,392
Shut up.

537
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:10,287
What's up with that Brendan kid?

538
00:31:11,143 --> 00:31:13,084
You're not serious
about him, are you?

539
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:14,079
It's up to him.

540
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,149
This kid's a train wreck.

541
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:18,682
Mack was in his EMT class,
said he's into dope.

542
00:31:18,683 --> 00:31:21,420
I'm talking hard shit.

543
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,140
What you doing, Supe? We're trying
to get certified as hotshots here.

544
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:39,236
All you rookies that are
just coming on as slot contenders,

545
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:42,874
I want you all to breathe in
this beautiful vista.

546
00:31:44,874 --> 00:31:46,843
Breathe it in deeply.

547
00:31:47,843 --> 00:31:50,513
'Cause after you all
get baptized,

548
00:31:50,514 --> 00:31:54,886
you're never gonna be able to look out into
the wilds and see that pure beauty again.

549
00:31:55,885 --> 00:31:59,223
Once you get a real hard taste
of the bitch at work,

550
00:32:00,223 --> 00:32:02,492
there's only one thing
you're gonna be able to see,

551
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:04,492
and that's fuel.

552
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:08,733
So think about that.

553
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:12,901
Meditate on it.

554
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:15,261
Then decide if this job
is for you.

555
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:21,041
Line it out!

556
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:22,009
Line it out!

557
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,431
Come on, guys, line it out.

558
00:32:23,456 --> 00:32:24,456
Line it out!

559
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:26,379
Line it out!

560
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,515
You think he dropped
dead on the trail?

561
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:06,683
Definite possibility.

562
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:09,687
If that shit stain died in my new
kicks, I'm gonna kill him, Supe.

563
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:12,759
Oh, well.

564
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:14,759
- Hey, Supe.
- What?

565
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:16,460
Check it out.

566
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,460
What?

567
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,470
Oh, my Lord.

568
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,518
Uh-huh.

569
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:46,956
All right.

570
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:48,574
See you 6:00 a.m., Monday.

571
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:08,676
You all right?

572
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:10,676
Yeah.

573
00:34:10,677 --> 00:34:12,044
Yeah? Can you drive?

574
00:34:12,045 --> 00:34:12,640
Yeah.

575
00:34:12,665 --> 00:34:13,948
Okay.

576
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:16,983
Pound tons of electrolytes, take
some Motrin, get some sleep, buddy.

577
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:18,751
You'll be all right.

578
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,854
Hey, I got your kicks.

579
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:23,126
You owe me a hundred bucks.

580
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,587
Duane saw it headed this way.

581
00:34:57,588 --> 00:35:00,695
Thought it looked lost,
too young to be on its own.

582
00:35:03,695 --> 00:35:06,064
She came through here.

583
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:09,135
Who dumps a young horse
here to die?

584
00:35:10,135 --> 00:35:11,734
Like it was nothing.

585
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,070
Well, we'll find her.

586
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,571
That way.

587
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:16,882
Let's go.

588
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:47,935
Ten minutes!

589
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:49,736
Come on, 10 minutes, shitbirds!

590
00:35:49,737 --> 00:35:53,374
Hey, let's go, Bravo! Let's go, Bravo!
Kick it up, max level!

591
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:55,743
You don't wanna be buying
Alpha's rounds all night!

592
00:35:55,744 --> 00:35:57,111
Come on!

593
00:35:57,112 --> 00:35:58,779
Norris, pop quiz.

594
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,280
You're cutting a line on a
side hill below the fire.

595
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:04,550
Debris and logs could start to roll down
and cross your line. What do you do?

596
00:36:04,551 --> 00:36:08,088
Build a cup trench and move the logs
so they're up and down the slope.

597
00:36:08,089 --> 00:36:10,356
There it is. Outstanding.

598
00:36:10,357 --> 00:36:12,760
Hey, McDonough, pop quiz.

599
00:36:12,761 --> 00:36:15,695
What's your 11th watch-out?

600
00:36:15,696 --> 00:36:18,429
No, don't look at him. Look at me.
What's your 11th watch-out?

601
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,565
The fire line you're cutting
hasn't been anchored.

602
00:36:20,566 --> 00:36:23,067
Wrong.
That's the 8th.

603
00:36:23,068 --> 00:36:24,542
You're getting
spot fires across...

604
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:25,567
That's 16th!

605
00:36:26,238 --> 00:36:27,973
Alpha Squad, hold!

606
00:36:27,974 --> 00:36:29,875
What's your 11th watch-out?

607
00:36:29,876 --> 00:36:32,611
Unburned fuel
between you and the fire.

608
00:36:32,612 --> 00:36:35,847
Firefighters died for us so we
could learn all these watch-outs.

609
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:38,518
If you get another one wrong,
I will choke you out.

610
00:36:39,518 --> 00:36:40,785
Yes, sir.

611
00:36:40,786 --> 00:36:43,123
Alpha Squad,
hundred off the deck. Now!

612
00:36:45,124 --> 00:36:46,858
My bad, guys.

613
00:36:47,921 --> 00:36:48,921
Let's go, Bravo!

614
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:54,263
Hey, McDipshit,
can you get any more challenged?

615
00:36:54,264 --> 00:36:56,933
You got dick right
since you've been here.

616
00:36:56,934 --> 00:36:58,268
Zero.

617
00:36:58,269 --> 00:36:59,269
Goddamn donut.

618
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,536
McDonut.

619
00:37:02,939 --> 00:37:06,975
I know you're doing this for your
baby girl, but I don't know, dude.

620
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:09,181
I've heard some shit
about her mama.

621
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:12,581
You sure that kid's
even yours, bro?

622
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,785
Whoa!

623
00:37:15,786 --> 00:37:16,786
McDonough!

624
00:37:17,121 --> 00:37:18,854
Do it. Throw that punch.

625
00:37:18,855 --> 00:37:20,689
Do it. Come on.

626
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:21,690
Do it.

627
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:22,961
Quit on yourself.

628
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:26,167
Go home. Die.

629
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,508
All right, Bravo,
get back to work!

630
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,374
That was way out of line, Mack.

631
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:44,313
I don't mind you sweating the rooks,
but you don't bring in family.

632
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:46,313
You hear me?

633
00:37:50,217 --> 00:37:52,752
Crew 7,
keep it moving, keep it moving!

634
00:37:52,753 --> 00:37:53,753
Deploy! Deploy!

635
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:55,021
Deploy!

636
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,657
Rookies on the inside!
Flames over that way!

637
00:37:57,658 --> 00:37:59,227
Feet to the flames,
feet to the flames!

638
00:38:00,227 --> 00:38:01,427
Go, go, go!

639
00:38:01,428 --> 00:38:02,896
Bottles and radios
in the shelter!

640
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:03,897
Let's go, let's go! Move!

641
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:05,063
Get rid of your tools!

642
00:38:05,064 --> 00:38:06,069
Go, go, go! Hurry it up!

643
00:38:06,094 --> 00:38:07,366
Boys, let's go, let's go!

644
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:09,702
Come on, speed it up!
Fire's chasing us!

645
00:38:09,703 --> 00:38:10,703
Move it, rookie, come on!

646
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:12,037
Go, go, go, go!

647
00:38:12,038 --> 00:38:12,649
Seven, six...

648
00:38:12,674 --> 00:38:13,872
Everybody in!

649
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:18,246
Five, four, three, two, one!

650
00:38:21,246 --> 00:38:22,583
All right, listen up.

651
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:24,583
Burnover is seconds away,

652
00:38:25,184 --> 00:38:28,018
and it sounds like a hundred freight
trains right on top of you.

653
00:38:28,756 --> 00:38:30,180
The wind ripping
like a hurricane,

654
00:38:31,156 --> 00:38:32,656
heat coming on
1,000 plus degrees.

655
00:38:34,325 --> 00:38:35,860
It's the apocalypse.

656
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:37,494
And remember,

657
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:40,063
stay locked down, bury your
face in that cool dirt,

658
00:38:40,064 --> 00:38:42,599
'cause as long as you can
breathe, you can survive.

659
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,399
When this thing
finally sweeps over you,

660
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,803
it's gonna feel like
the end of the world.

661
00:38:46,804 --> 00:38:48,739
No matter what you hear,

662
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,774
no matter what's going on...

663
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:51,775
What the...

664
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:54,096
Who's in there?

665
00:38:54,121 --> 00:38:55,170
Rose. Rose.

666
00:38:56,146 --> 00:38:58,281
Is that your sock
next to your shelter?

667
00:38:58,282 --> 00:38:59,782
What?

668
00:38:59,783 --> 00:39:01,617
That's Rosie's
beat-off sock, sir.

669
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:07,722
I asked you a question.

670
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:09,959
No, it's definitely not my sock, sir.
I don't...

671
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,459
Then why is your name
written on it?

672
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,095
'Cause it's his sock, sir.

673
00:39:15,931 --> 00:39:17,966
Mack, out of the shelter!

674
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:19,567
I don't wanna come out, Steed.

675
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:22,469
I don't blame you.
Get out of the shelter, MacKenzie!

676
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,473
Come on, California boy!
Come on up!

677
00:39:25,474 --> 00:39:26,474
Stand up.

678
00:39:26,475 --> 00:39:27,808
You're such an asshole.

679
00:39:29,278 --> 00:39:31,245
Do you think this is funny?

680
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:32,446
I wear anklets.

681
00:39:33,647 --> 00:39:34,268
Ankle socks.

682
00:39:34,293 --> 00:39:35,615
Is he a joke to you?

683
00:39:35,616 --> 00:39:36,816
Yeah.

684
00:39:38,286 --> 00:39:38,874
Hi, this is Marsh.

685
00:39:38,899 --> 00:39:39,986
What's up?

686
00:39:39,987 --> 00:39:41,267
Just running a deployment drill.

687
00:39:42,156 --> 00:39:43,656
What you got?

688
00:39:43,657 --> 00:39:45,825
New start in the
Chiricahua Mountains.

689
00:39:45,826 --> 00:39:48,262
Ate up 9,000 acres
since yesterday.

690
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:50,932
They ordered up
a Type 2 ICS team.

691
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,100
So, mount up.

692
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,436
This is it, Eric, game time.

693
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,938
What do you mean?

694
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:01,806
I called in a favor
with an IC that owes me.

695
00:40:01,807 --> 00:40:02,807
Hayes.

696
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:06,813
You're being evaluated.

697
00:40:07,813 --> 00:40:09,181
I'll hit you with the details.

698
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:11,983
Good luck.

699
00:40:11,984 --> 00:40:13,121
Okay, got it.

700
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:18,491
I feel like your mother.
You're my second-favorite son.

701
00:40:19,491 --> 00:40:21,627
All right, gather up!

702
00:40:23,627 --> 00:40:24,930
Got some news.

703
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,998
We're heading to
a fire down south.

704
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:29,632
And we're getting
our eval on it.

705
00:40:32,102 --> 00:40:34,142
Settle down, settle down.
Remember, when we do this,

706
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,376
act like we've done it before.

707
00:40:47,016 --> 00:40:49,084
Hey, Ryder.

708
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:51,687
Hey, I'm sorry I'm missing
your birthday again, buster.

709
00:40:51,688 --> 00:40:52,921
But you know what?

710
00:40:52,922 --> 00:40:54,755
We're having a second party
when I get back.

711
00:40:54,756 --> 00:40:56,257
It's gonna be even better, okay?

712
00:40:56,258 --> 00:40:58,394
"Good night, stars.
Good night, air.

713
00:40:58,395 --> 00:41:00,996
"Good night, noises everywhere."

714
00:41:00,997 --> 00:41:03,401
When I come home a hotshot,
what are you gonna do?

715
00:41:05,401 --> 00:41:07,521
Babe, babe, I just...
I just need a little motivation.

716
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:11,206
I mean, give me something deep,
give me something nasty to think about.

717
00:41:12,206 --> 00:41:14,644
Ooh, I like it. Mmm.

718
00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:16,644
You got to go?

719
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:18,879
Okay.

720
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,018
Okay, bye.

721
00:41:23,018 --> 00:41:24,487
Donut.

722
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:27,854
Rookie.

723
00:41:28,756 --> 00:41:30,993
My girl, Cheyanne.

724
00:41:31,993 --> 00:41:32,993
Nice.

725
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,695
Nice?

726
00:41:34,696 --> 00:41:36,530
I mean, that is a world-beating
piece of ass right there.

727
00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:39,264
Look at those superstar
titties of hers.

728
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:42,702
I mean, if we get certified as hotshots,
she's gonna do things to me.

729
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:43,702
Do you understand?

730
00:41:46,405 --> 00:41:48,409
Hey, bring it in.

731
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:51,909
Bring it in.

732
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,914
Come on, just nice and tight.

733
00:41:54,914 --> 00:41:56,915
I hope you do understand,

734
00:41:56,916 --> 00:42:00,718
because we've been working to get this
eval for over four years now, bro.

735
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,322
And a lot can happen to a little
puke like you out on the line.

736
00:42:04,323 --> 00:42:09,459
And if you do anything, I mean anything,
to mess our shit up,

737
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,140
something's definitely
gonna happen to you.

738
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:18,936
Okay, good chat.

739
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:35,484
Look at you, looking like a cat
eating shit out of a hairbrush.

740
00:42:35,485 --> 00:42:36,485
This is it, Papa.

741
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,821
We're gonna crush this eval.

742
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,557
Yeah, let's just do what we do.

743
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:43,626
Weather's working
against us right now.

744
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,130
Wind's gusting to 20
and the humidity is dropping.

745
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,029
Fire's got two heads
at the moment.

746
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:54,634
Hotshot crews in Division Echo will
look at cutting direct line here.

747
00:42:54,635 --> 00:42:58,505
Division Alpha will build
an indirect line here.

748
00:42:58,506 --> 00:43:00,176
Now, that line
is our trigger point.

749
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:05,513
If the fire crosses it, we'll look
at evacuating the city of Portal,

750
00:43:05,514 --> 00:43:07,881
five miles to the northeast.

751
00:43:07,882 --> 00:43:10,015
Good luck. Be careful.

752
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:18,627
Are you Marsh?

753
00:43:19,627 --> 00:43:21,460
Yes, sir, Eric Marsh, Crew 7.

754
00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:22,461
Hayes.

755
00:43:22,462 --> 00:43:23,963
Oh, pleasure, sir.

756
00:43:23,964 --> 00:43:25,864
- My captain, Jesse Steed.
- Nice to meet you.

757
00:43:25,865 --> 00:43:27,800
All right. So,
what are we doing?

758
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:29,969
Oh, well, it looks like
we're in Division Alpha.

759
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,271
We're gonna cut a line along the
base of this hill right there.

760
00:43:32,272 --> 00:43:35,373
Yeah, there's no direct access
there, so we'll helo in, spike out.

761
00:43:35,374 --> 00:43:37,998
All right, well,
let's see what you boys got.

762
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:08,707
Whoa!

763
00:44:09,707 --> 00:44:12,007
Hey, don't puke, you pukes.

764
00:44:20,217 --> 00:44:21,350
All right.

765
00:44:46,274 --> 00:44:47,776
Bravo Squad!

766
00:44:48,776 --> 00:44:51,715
Bravo Squad,
watch that slope there!

767
00:44:53,715 --> 00:44:55,482
Jesse, where you at?

768
00:44:55,483 --> 00:44:58,752
Scouting two ridges over.
Got brands coming in, spot fires.

769
00:44:58,753 --> 00:45:01,321
Nothing crazy, but she's
definitely headed our way.

770
00:45:01,322 --> 00:45:03,199
All right, why don't you work
your way back down to the crew?

771
00:45:03,223 --> 00:45:04,223
I'm gonna go scout ahead.

772
00:45:04,224 --> 00:45:05,492
Copy that.

773
00:45:05,493 --> 00:45:07,426
You got a high-speed,
low-drag crew,

774
00:45:07,427 --> 00:45:09,595
but how long can you
run them at that pace?

775
00:45:09,596 --> 00:45:10,636
Well, as long as it takes.

776
00:45:11,132 --> 00:45:13,733
Bad cut!
Tree coming down!

777
00:45:13,734 --> 00:45:15,138
- Falling!
- Falling!

778
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:25,476
Division Alpha, this is Crew 7.

779
00:45:25,477 --> 00:45:28,279
You got a spot
weather forecast for me?

780
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,192
We have a storm
cell kicking up from the south.

781
00:45:30,216 --> 00:45:33,484
High wind advisory.
25 to 30 miles per hour.

782
00:45:33,485 --> 00:45:35,791
All right, copy that.
Thank you.

783
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,259
Want a piece of my Carolina ass?

784
00:45:42,259 --> 00:45:44,060
Come and get it.

785
00:45:47,132 --> 00:45:49,065
Fire's making a run
toward our line.

786
00:45:49,066 --> 00:45:51,934
By the time she gets here, she's
gonna be too strong to hold.

787
00:45:51,935 --> 00:45:54,575
It's gonna crown that ridge, spot
over, and run straight into town.

788
00:45:55,173 --> 00:45:56,873
If we backburn
this side of the mountain,

789
00:45:56,874 --> 00:45:59,710
by the time bitch comes over,
she'll have no fuel to feed into.

790
00:45:59,711 --> 00:46:01,978
That's a god-awful idea.

791
00:46:01,979 --> 00:46:03,947
All the conditions
favor the fire,

792
00:46:03,948 --> 00:46:05,881
and when that blaze
comes down that mountain,

793
00:46:05,882 --> 00:46:08,884
it's gonna kick your ass and use
your burn to get even stronger.

794
00:46:08,885 --> 00:46:10,620
We won't be able to stop it.

795
00:46:10,621 --> 00:46:12,888
Okay, well, our line's not gonna
hold unless we burn it off.

796
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:14,290
But it'll slow it down,

797
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:16,526
maybe give us a chance to
get other resources up here.

798
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:17,893
Okay, what you don't
understand, sir...

799
00:46:17,894 --> 00:46:21,996
Well, what you don't
understand is 40 years, son.

800
00:46:21,997 --> 00:46:25,032
I was on the job when you
were still shitting yellow.

801
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:28,336
So, if you think you're gonna
make a big move and impress me,

802
00:46:28,337 --> 00:46:30,539
I'm telling you
right now, don't.

803
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,807
Due respect,
you're just an observer.

804
00:46:32,808 --> 00:46:33,888
So let us do our job, okay?

805
00:46:34,176 --> 00:46:35,777
- No, you're not a...
- No, no, step off!

806
00:46:35,778 --> 00:46:37,358
Now. Step off.

807
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:52,499
Damn.

808
00:46:57,498 --> 00:46:59,201
What's y'all's comfort level?

809
00:47:00,201 --> 00:47:01,428
Are you down for the cause?

810
00:47:01,453 --> 00:47:02,836
Let's get after it, then.

811
00:47:02,837 --> 00:47:03,678
Get some.

812
00:47:03,703 --> 00:47:04,729
Boss.

813
00:47:05,705 --> 00:47:07,944
Division Alpha, this is Crew 7.

814
00:47:18,718 --> 00:47:20,554
Is that a rosary?

815
00:47:21,554 --> 00:47:23,688
No, prayer beads.

816
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:25,457
Buddhist, huh?

817
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:29,358
Well, this thing goes sideways,
nothing's gonna save you.

818
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:30,496
Not even Buddha.

819
00:47:32,496 --> 00:47:34,298
Holy shit, dude.

820
00:47:34,299 --> 00:47:35,999
Can't believe we're about to light
up a couple thousand acres.

821
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,934
Chill, bro, this is what we do.

822
00:47:37,935 --> 00:47:40,148
Once you light that fuse, you throw
it deep into the fire, all right?

823
00:47:40,172 --> 00:47:41,372
Yeah, cool.

824
00:47:41,373 --> 00:47:43,406
Mack, Steed.

825
00:47:43,407 --> 00:47:45,674
Putting fuel on the ground now.
Make sure you stay ahead of us.

826
00:47:45,675 --> 00:47:46,675
Copy that.

827
00:47:47,211 --> 00:47:48,251
Here we go.

828
00:48:04,293 --> 00:48:06,833
Nice. All right, uno más.

829
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:10,846
Hey, you all right?

830
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:11,432
Shit.

831
00:48:13,802 --> 00:48:14,705
Dude, shit, go.

832
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:15,668
Bees, man.

833
00:48:15,669 --> 00:48:16,599
Bro, run. Bro, go.

834
00:48:16,624 --> 00:48:17,271
Go! Go!

835
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:19,072
Run! Bees! Bees, man!

836
00:48:19,073 --> 00:48:19,557
Oh, shit!

837
00:48:19,582 --> 00:48:21,007
They're stinging my balls!

838
00:48:24,278 --> 00:48:25,646
Who said that?

839
00:48:25,647 --> 00:48:27,917
Oh, dude, karma's a
bitch, ain't it, Mack?

840
00:48:31,751 --> 00:48:32,703
Rose.

841
00:48:32,728 --> 00:48:33,654
What?

842
00:48:33,655 --> 00:48:35,821
That went in my asshole.

843
00:48:35,822 --> 00:48:36,297
Jesus.

844
00:48:36,322 --> 00:48:37,417
You ever read the Bible?

845
00:48:40,393 --> 00:48:42,261
Yeah. I mean,
not like you, but...

846
00:48:42,262 --> 00:48:43,497
Yeah, it's good.

847
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,276
Well, that worked.

848
00:48:57,276 --> 00:48:58,396
No matter what Hayes thinks.

849
00:48:59,345 --> 00:49:00,883
Mmm-hmm.

850
00:49:02,883 --> 00:49:04,798
Get some sleep, Papa.

851
00:49:52,496 --> 00:49:54,829
It's for my boy, Ryder.
I bring him home a rock...

852
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:55,216
Snag!

853
00:49:55,241 --> 00:49:56,064
Shit!

854
00:49:58,301 --> 00:50:00,002
Holy shit!

855
00:50:01,002 --> 00:50:02,704
Everybody okay?

856
00:50:02,705 --> 00:50:03,745
- Yeah!
- Yeah, we're okay.

857
00:50:04,073 --> 00:50:05,740
All right, keep it moving!

858
00:50:10,912 --> 00:50:11,912
Thanks, man.

859
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,725
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- What?

860
00:50:26,726 --> 00:50:28,461
- Where's your chinstrap?
- My what?

861
00:50:28,462 --> 00:50:30,582
- Your chinny!
- You can't fly without a strap, Donut!

862
00:50:31,098 --> 00:50:32,307
Shit, I don't know.
I just had it, man.

863
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:33,031
Hey, we got to run.

864
00:50:33,032 --> 00:50:34,632
I got no time for this.
Mack, set him up!

865
00:50:51,383 --> 00:50:52,884
Donut!

866
00:50:52,885 --> 00:50:53,885
Hey!

867
00:50:59,123 --> 00:50:59,824
I think this is yours!

868
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,269
Hey.

869
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:14,121
However this shakes out,
just know we saved all that.

870
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,591
Jesse. Jesse, what...
What happened?

871
00:51:37,592 --> 00:51:39,761
Hey, hey, settle down,
Manda-bear. It's me.

872
00:51:39,762 --> 00:51:42,934
Oh, Jesus Christ, Eric.

873
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:47,335
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.

874
00:51:47,336 --> 00:51:49,138
I got my phone
smashed up this morning.

875
00:51:50,138 --> 00:51:51,258
So, you're on your way back?

876
00:51:52,174 --> 00:51:53,176
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

877
00:51:54,176 --> 00:51:55,176
How'd it go?

878
00:51:59,113 --> 00:52:00,193
I think I really messed up.

879
00:52:01,149 --> 00:52:02,950
What do you mean?
What happened?

880
00:52:02,951 --> 00:52:05,786
I called a play out on the line, and
I know it was the right thing to do

881
00:52:05,787 --> 00:52:07,687
and I'd do it again,

882
00:52:07,688 --> 00:52:11,025
but I think it's gonna cost us
our certification.

883
00:52:12,025 --> 00:52:13,496
I'm really sorry.

884
00:52:14,496 --> 00:52:15,898
Yeah.

885
00:52:17,898 --> 00:52:19,802
Well...

886
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:23,468
I peed in my pants today.

887
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:24,504
You...

888
00:52:25,504 --> 00:52:26,504
You what?

889
00:52:27,074 --> 00:52:28,840
I peed in my pants.

890
00:52:28,841 --> 00:52:30,376
- Really?
- Yeah.

891
00:52:30,377 --> 00:52:34,848
I was working with a colt
over at Sam Lapeer's ranch,

892
00:52:35,848 --> 00:52:37,082
and I had to go really bad,

893
00:52:38,082 --> 00:52:41,284
and the colt just reared up
and came down hard on my foot.

894
00:52:43,155 --> 00:52:44,688
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

895
00:52:44,689 --> 00:52:47,025
I'm fine except I
peed in my pants.

896
00:52:47,026 --> 00:52:49,226
- Did anybody see it?
- Everyone.

897
00:52:49,227 --> 00:52:50,227
They did?

898
00:52:50,228 --> 00:52:51,696
I felt like a jerk.

899
00:52:53,998 --> 00:52:56,633
And then I had to borrow pants
from Sam just to get home.

900
00:52:59,469 --> 00:53:01,472
Oh...

901
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:03,207
You know how much I love you?

902
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:06,868
Go back to sleep.
I'll see you in a little while, okay?

903
00:53:07,078 --> 00:53:07,528
Okay.

904
00:53:07,553 --> 00:53:08,879
Thank you for that.

905
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:09,879
See you soon.

906
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,242
- Night.
- Night-night.

907
00:53:46,013 --> 00:53:47,480
This is Marsh.

908
00:53:47,481 --> 00:53:48,882
Hey, Eric,
how did it go on the eval?

909
00:53:48,883 --> 00:53:50,018
Did you find out?
Do you know if you're good?

910
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:51,518
- Dale.
- What?

911
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:53,239
- I... I can't talk right now, Dale.
- What?

912
00:54:20,814 --> 00:54:21,814
God.

913
00:54:38,097 --> 00:54:39,931
Where is he?

914
00:54:39,932 --> 00:54:40,932
Office.

915
00:54:44,536 --> 00:54:45,536
Hey... Oh.

916
00:54:49,406 --> 00:54:50,777
Come in.

917
00:54:52,777 --> 00:54:54,010
God.

918
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,520
What the hell
happened out there?

919
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,155
I did what I thought was right.

920
00:55:06,155 --> 00:55:09,329
And the boys, man,
were they a sight to see.

921
00:55:16,298 --> 00:55:17,805
I've never been so proud.

922
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:31,379
Deploy.

923
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,113
I mean it. Deploy now!

924
00:55:32,138 --> 00:55:33,046
Let's go, boys!

925
00:55:33,047 --> 00:55:33,672
Move, move, move!

926
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,481
Fire's that way!

927
00:55:34,482 --> 00:55:36,349
Come on, let's show
him how it's done.

928
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,585
Hey, make some space, Rosie.
Come on, man.

929
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:39,987
Face to the floor!

930
00:55:39,988 --> 00:55:41,348
Twenty bucks I beat you, Mack.

931
00:55:42,323 --> 00:55:43,991
Mack, what are you
doing? Hurry!

932
00:55:43,992 --> 00:55:46,893
Five, four, three...

933
00:55:46,894 --> 00:55:48,394
Come on, get down, get down!

934
00:55:48,395 --> 00:55:49,666
Two, one.

935
00:55:52,665 --> 00:55:53,668
Thirty-two seconds.

936
00:55:55,668 --> 00:55:57,509
That's very, very good.

937
00:56:01,509 --> 00:56:04,410
I know you boys had a
rough go of it out there,

938
00:56:04,411 --> 00:56:05,771
but if you're looking
for sympathy,

939
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:09,547
the only place you're gonna
find it is in the dictionary,

940
00:56:09,548 --> 00:56:11,653
somewhere between
"shit" and "syphilis."

941
00:56:13,653 --> 00:56:15,423
All right, come on out.

942
00:56:18,423 --> 00:56:20,190
Here's the deal.

943
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:22,192
I spoke with Hayes.

944
00:56:22,193 --> 00:56:26,029
He thinks your Supe here
is a real cocky sucker,

945
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:31,103
but he thinks you all are one of the
best damn crews he's ever seen.

946
00:56:32,103 --> 00:56:34,471
Congratulations.

947
00:56:34,472 --> 00:56:35,368
You're hotshots.

948
00:56:41,445 --> 00:56:42,444
- Nice!
- Hell, yeah!

949
00:56:43,147 --> 00:56:43,707
Hotshots!

950
00:56:43,732 --> 00:56:44,732
Sweet!

951
00:56:50,453 --> 00:56:51,788
Ah, Woyjeck!

952
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:54,356
All right, hey.

953
00:56:54,357 --> 00:56:55,925
We... We need a name.

954
00:56:55,926 --> 00:56:57,427
How about Thumb Butte Hotshots?

955
00:56:57,428 --> 00:56:58,427
Boo!

956
00:56:58,428 --> 00:56:59,896
I got it, I got it, I got it.

957
00:57:00,896 --> 00:57:01,896
The Firelords.

958
00:57:02,097 --> 00:57:02,564
No.

959
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:03,964
Why not?

960
00:57:03,965 --> 00:57:05,019
That's the name
of your band, bro.

961
00:57:05,043 --> 00:57:05,866
Yeah, and we slay.

962
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:08,035
Yeah, you slay,
in your mama's garage.

963
00:57:13,376 --> 00:57:14,477
Granite Mountain.

964
00:57:16,477 --> 00:57:17,477
Yeah.

965
00:57:18,413 --> 00:57:19,453
Granite Mountain Hotshots.

966
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:20,968
There it is!

967
00:57:20,993 --> 00:57:21,782
Yeah.

968
00:57:21,783 --> 00:57:22,783
There it is.

969
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:33,860
Hey.

970
00:57:34,427 --> 00:57:35,929
Hey.

971
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:38,864
I appreciate you
making the effort.

972
00:57:38,865 --> 00:57:40,500
Leaving the stuff.

973
00:57:40,501 --> 00:57:42,271
Yeah, yeah. It's no problem.

974
00:57:43,271 --> 00:57:44,305
Wow.

975
00:57:45,305 --> 00:57:47,439
Wow, you look...

976
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,320
Yeah, I know, I'm pretty filthy.
We were just...

977
00:57:50,109 --> 00:57:52,744
We were doing a fire down south.

978
00:57:52,745 --> 00:57:54,914
Chiricahua.

979
00:57:54,915 --> 00:57:58,584
Yeah, I heard that
you were working for Crew 7.

980
00:57:58,585 --> 00:58:01,519
Yeah, actually, we just...
We just got certified today as hotshots,

981
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,489
so we're the
Granite Mountain Hotshots.

982
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:07,160
That's amazing. Congrats.

983
00:58:13,164 --> 00:58:14,164
- She's so pretty.
- Yeah.

984
00:58:17,135 --> 00:58:18,338
Do you wanna hold her?

985
00:58:20,337 --> 00:58:22,039
Nah, I'm...

986
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:25,876
You know, I'm so dirty.
I don't wanna mess up her clothes.

987
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:28,812
It's okay, really. It's fine.

988
00:58:28,813 --> 00:58:29,406
Here. Yeah.

989
00:58:29,431 --> 00:58:31,209
Yeah, yeah, I'd love...
Yeah, please.

990
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:48,332
Ooh, a little gas.

991
00:58:51,401 --> 00:58:52,667
She's so pretty.

992
00:58:52,668 --> 00:58:55,309
Yeah.
She looks like you.

993
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:02,550
Nat...

994
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:09,854
I'm sorry.

995
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:14,861
It's okay.

996
00:59:19,861 --> 00:59:22,728
You ladies better listen up
and listen good.

997
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:25,497
If there's one thing I know,
it's applesauce.

998
00:59:25,498 --> 00:59:26,738
Go ahead and try that, darling.

999
00:59:27,134 --> 00:59:28,602
Okay.

1000
00:59:32,139 --> 00:59:33,139
That's right.

1001
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,806
Mmm.

1002
00:59:34,807 --> 00:59:36,307
That's right. Yes, it is.

1003
00:59:36,308 --> 00:59:37,377
That is good applesauce.

1004
00:59:37,378 --> 00:59:39,377
Best dang applesauce
you ever had.

1005
00:59:39,378 --> 00:59:40,980
Okay, it was cute at first.

1006
00:59:40,981 --> 00:59:42,246
Now I just wanna scream.

1007
00:59:42,247 --> 00:59:43,581
Is that yours and that's him?

1008
00:59:43,582 --> 00:59:44,662
- That's both.
- That was...

1009
00:59:45,084 --> 00:59:45,730
And who's that? Is that his?

1010
00:59:45,755 --> 00:59:46,755
This is the one we lost.

1011
00:59:50,422 --> 00:59:52,742
That's yours. Okay, keep that
away from the kid. Make sure.

1012
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:54,091
I'm gonna get some water.

1013
00:59:54,092 --> 00:59:55,260
What? Okay.

1014
00:59:55,261 --> 00:59:57,064
Smoking is over for you.
It's over.

1015
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,429
Sound familiar?

1016
01:00:05,204 --> 01:00:07,106
You got that...
Stay still, stay still.

1017
01:00:08,106 --> 01:00:10,985
Wait a minute. I'll wipe...
I'll wipe that off for you.

1018
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:22,385
You must be Brendan.

1019
01:00:22,386 --> 01:00:23,886
Yes, ma'am.

1020
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:25,287
I'm Amanda, Eric's wife.

1021
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,288
Oh, so nice to meet you.

1022
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,657
I've heard a lot about you.

1023
01:00:27,658 --> 01:00:28,658
How's it going?

1024
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:29,925
It's good.

1025
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:31,425
Yeah?

1026
01:00:31,426 --> 01:00:32,527
Yeah. I...

1027
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:34,328
You know, I really
appreciate the opportunity.

1028
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:36,998
And...

1029
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:39,333
I really respect
your husband a lot.

1030
01:00:39,334 --> 01:00:42,173
So, I hope to be
more like him someday.

1031
01:00:45,173 --> 01:00:47,043
You guys have more in common
than you think.

1032
01:00:49,043 --> 01:00:50,644
Hang in there.

1033
01:00:50,645 --> 01:00:51,815
Thanks.

1034
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:53,815
Where are you taking me?

1035
01:00:54,116 --> 01:00:55,471
I want to show you something.

1036
01:00:55,496 --> 01:00:56,496
All right.

1037
01:00:58,219 --> 01:00:59,454
What?

1038
01:01:00,822 --> 01:01:02,222
For me?

1039
01:01:02,223 --> 01:01:04,048
You gonna take care of this one?

1040
01:01:04,073 --> 01:01:04,657
Yeah.

1041
01:01:04,658 --> 01:01:05,928
God.

1042
01:01:23,976 --> 01:01:25,172
- What's up, Mack?
- What up?

1043
01:01:28,148 --> 01:01:29,817
Everything all right?

1044
01:01:30,817 --> 01:01:32,159
No, dude, far from it.

1045
01:01:39,158 --> 01:01:41,259
Anything you wanna talk about?

1046
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:44,030
Um... You remember
my gal Cheyanne, right?

1047
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:46,030
Yeah.

1048
01:01:46,031 --> 01:01:47,231
Yeah, well, I came home

1049
01:01:47,232 --> 01:01:50,001
and found the slut
had been cheating on me.

1050
01:01:52,036 --> 01:01:53,337
- Right?
- Really?

1051
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:54,872
But you know what the kicker is?

1052
01:01:54,873 --> 01:01:59,744
The kicker is she's banging
some dude on Flagstaff PD.

1053
01:02:00,744 --> 01:02:02,513
Yeah.

1054
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:04,647
I mean, whatever, you know.

1055
01:02:04,648 --> 01:02:05,881
Whatever.

1056
01:02:05,882 --> 01:02:07,584
I mean, what I got to find

1057
01:02:07,585 --> 01:02:11,890
is a new place, 'cause I moved out
of our apartment into my car.

1058
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:13,890
Bitch.

1059
01:02:18,095 --> 01:02:20,433
I mean, hey,
I got an extra room.

1060
01:02:23,433 --> 01:02:24,433
Seriously?

1061
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,372
Yeah.

1062
01:02:30,373 --> 01:02:31,842
You know, if you need a...

1063
01:02:32,842 --> 01:02:34,082
Spot to crash for a little bit.

1064
01:02:39,081 --> 01:02:40,318
Right on, dude.

1065
01:02:43,317 --> 01:02:46,621
Man, I just got to kick out my
buddy from the Flagstaff PD.

1066
01:02:46,622 --> 01:02:47,622
He...

1067
01:02:48,256 --> 01:02:49,722
Oh, funny guy.

1068
01:02:49,723 --> 01:02:51,627
Yeah, his name...
His name's... His name's Dave.

1069
01:02:52,627 --> 01:02:53,627
Man, I'll tell you,

1070
01:02:55,295 --> 01:02:58,630
as true as I'm standing here
and as strange as this is,

1071
01:02:58,631 --> 01:02:59,243
I'm happy.

1072
01:03:00,468 --> 01:03:02,734
I'm happy and
grateful to everyone,

1073
01:03:02,735 --> 01:03:04,938
the families, my crew,

1074
01:03:04,939 --> 01:03:07,272
Duane, Amanda.

1075
01:03:07,273 --> 01:03:08,741
You know, Granite Mountain

1076
01:03:08,742 --> 01:03:12,277
is the first municipal hotshot
crew in this entire country.

1077
01:03:14,781 --> 01:03:16,581
Can you believe that?
That's saying something.

1078
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:19,517
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,

1079
01:03:19,518 --> 01:03:21,986
this first season as hotshots
is gonna be tough.

1080
01:03:21,987 --> 01:03:24,222
We're gonna be traveling
all over the country.

1081
01:03:24,223 --> 01:03:25,943
We're gonna be working harder,
going longer,

1082
01:03:26,092 --> 01:03:30,293
so it's important that this Granite
Mountain family pulls together

1083
01:03:30,294 --> 01:03:32,262
and looks out for each other.

1084
01:03:32,263 --> 01:03:34,331
'Cause we can't do this
without your support.

1085
01:03:34,332 --> 01:03:35,834
That's right.

1086
01:03:36,834 --> 01:03:38,338
Esse quam videri.

1087
01:03:39,338 --> 01:03:42,840
"To be, rather than to seem."

1088
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:45,479
And everybody here
has lived up to this creed.

1089
01:03:47,478 --> 01:03:50,148
No Supe could be prouder,

1090
01:03:51,148 --> 01:03:54,886
right now, of his boys
than I am of you guys.

1091
01:03:55,886 --> 01:03:58,722
So, to commemorate
this occasion,

1092
01:03:58,723 --> 01:04:00,390
I had some tees made up.

1093
01:04:01,491 --> 01:04:03,224
All right?

1094
01:04:03,225 --> 01:04:05,726
Now, you can only wear them
if you're a hotshot.

1095
01:04:05,727 --> 01:04:07,695
Right?

1096
01:04:07,696 --> 01:04:10,498
Okay, so it's sleeping
with a hotshot, too, okay?

1097
01:04:12,468 --> 01:04:13,468
There you go.

1098
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:25,680
Oh!

1099
01:04:25,681 --> 01:04:29,052
There she is, little Michaela.

1100
01:04:30,052 --> 01:04:31,292
You want to show Mack your dog?

1101
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:33,854
Your dad and
Uncle Mack are stoked

1102
01:04:33,855 --> 01:04:36,389
you're having your
first sleepover with us.

1103
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:37,890
She's got a puppy...

1104
01:04:37,891 --> 01:04:39,592
Dude, what did you do?

1105
01:04:39,593 --> 01:04:42,695
I, uh,
baby-proofed everything,

1106
01:04:42,696 --> 01:04:45,733
like the bathroom cabinets,
the kitchen, the whole house, basically.

1107
01:04:45,734 --> 01:04:47,234
So, we're good.

1108
01:04:47,235 --> 01:04:48,869
That's awesome, man.
Thank you.

1109
01:04:50,037 --> 01:04:51,442
Aw, why not?

1110
01:04:56,441 --> 01:04:57,441
She loves this dog, man.

1111
01:04:57,442 --> 01:04:59,014
Yeah.

1112
01:05:01,014 --> 01:05:03,381
Family, bro.

1113
01:05:03,894 --> 01:05:05,283
Let's get the bunny, huh?

1114
01:05:05,284 --> 01:05:06,618
You like the bunny.

1115
01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:08,552
Yeah, he's a friend.

1116
01:05:08,553 --> 01:05:09,038
Hello.

1117
01:05:09,063 --> 01:05:10,515
Dude, what took you so long?

1118
01:05:13,491 --> 01:05:14,991
She's, like,
she's really hot, man.

1119
01:05:14,992 --> 01:05:16,260
How's she doing?

1120
01:05:16,261 --> 01:05:17,261
She's, like, burning up.

1121
01:05:17,262 --> 01:05:18,364
Oh, God.

1122
01:05:19,364 --> 01:05:21,666
I know. I know. It's okay.

1123
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:24,667
This is your friend.
She's your friend.

1124
01:05:24,668 --> 01:05:26,168
Hey, bro. The other way.

1125
01:05:26,169 --> 01:05:27,904
Okay.

1126
01:05:27,905 --> 01:05:29,405
The other end. No.

1127
01:05:29,406 --> 01:05:30,610
This?

1128
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:34,610
What?

1129
01:05:37,249 --> 01:05:39,449
One hundred and three
point four! Dude!

1130
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:40,548
No bueno, man.

1131
01:05:42,085 --> 01:05:43,085
Call a pediatrician, man.

1132
01:05:43,086 --> 01:05:44,820
I called him like five times.

1133
01:05:44,821 --> 01:05:45,478
He's not picking up.

1134
01:05:45,503 --> 01:05:46,923
What do you mean,
he hasn't picked up?

1135
01:05:46,924 --> 01:05:47,541
I don't know, he's
being an asshole!

1136
01:05:47,566 --> 01:05:48,687
We gotta go to the hospital.

1137
01:05:49,092 --> 01:05:50,127
Yeah, right, man.

1138
01:05:51,127 --> 01:05:52,595
It's my first night alone with her.
Natalie will never let me see her again.

1139
01:05:52,596 --> 01:05:54,229
Yeah, you're right.

1140
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:57,998
Turbyfill! His wife, Stephanie!
I think she's a nurse.

1141
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:03,237
Hey, how's she doing?

1142
01:06:03,238 --> 01:06:05,718
Her temperature's coming down.
Her coloring's good. She's fine.

1143
01:06:06,108 --> 01:06:07,909
Yeah, she's good?

1144
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:12,380
Infants burn high fevers sometimes.
It's totally normal. Yeah.

1145
01:06:12,381 --> 01:06:17,618
All right. Good. Thank you.

1146
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:19,954
Yeah, I didn't know that's
how you took a temperature.

1147
01:06:19,955 --> 01:06:21,731
All right, men. I
think we're good.

1148
01:06:21,756 --> 01:06:22,323
Whew!

1149
01:06:22,324 --> 01:06:24,324
She's, uh...
Yeah, she's happy, so...

1150
01:06:24,325 --> 01:06:26,294
Good, man.

1151
01:06:26,295 --> 01:06:27,729
Yeah.

1152
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:29,829
I really appreciate
you guys coming by.

1153
01:06:31,371 --> 01:06:32,230
Ah...

1154
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:34,601
It's what we're here for, bro.

1155
01:06:34,602 --> 01:06:36,902
Man, like, I've been through
some pretty crazy, intense shit,

1156
01:06:36,903 --> 01:06:40,273
but that was, hands down,
the scariest thing of my life.

1157
01:06:41,408 --> 01:06:42,408
Seriously.

1158
01:06:43,944 --> 01:06:45,344
Welcome to fatherhood, dude.

1159
01:06:45,345 --> 01:06:48,180
Yeah, I'm gonna pump
the brakes on having kids.

1160
01:06:52,117 --> 01:06:55,888
Just the thought of fire
season starting makes me lonely.

1161
01:06:55,889 --> 01:06:59,457
Well, once this crew proves
itself this first season,

1162
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:01,630
we'll be able to
slow down a little bit.

1163
01:07:05,629 --> 01:07:09,135
You know, the other wives,
they always say,

1164
01:07:10,135 --> 01:07:12,575
"At least you don't have kids.
It's so much harder with kids."

1165
01:07:13,138 --> 01:07:15,808
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

1166
01:07:16,808 --> 01:07:19,676
It's starting to
get under my skin.

1167
01:07:19,677 --> 01:07:21,115
Really? Why?

1168
01:07:25,115 --> 01:07:29,386
'Cause those kids give them
something to hold onto and love.

1169
01:07:29,387 --> 01:07:30,391
No matter what.

1170
01:07:34,391 --> 01:07:35,306
You know what?

1171
01:07:35,331 --> 01:07:36,331
What?

1172
01:07:37,026 --> 01:07:39,528
If I could put you in my pocket,

1173
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:41,049
- I'd take you wherever I go.
- Yeah...

1174
01:07:41,131 --> 01:07:42,171
- I would.
- Don't do that.

1175
01:07:43,133 --> 01:07:45,735
Don't do what?

1176
01:07:45,736 --> 01:07:47,903
I want to talk about it.

1177
01:07:47,904 --> 01:07:49,272
Well, okay, what?

1178
01:07:50,272 --> 01:07:51,271
Kids?

1179
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:53,940
Us.

1180
01:07:53,941 --> 01:07:56,344
Having a family.

1181
01:07:56,345 --> 01:07:58,712
Look, we had an understanding
when we got married.

1182
01:07:58,713 --> 01:08:00,213
And you agreed to it.

1183
01:08:00,214 --> 01:08:01,583
Yeah, I know, I agreed.

1184
01:08:01,584 --> 01:08:05,719
I guess I never felt like I was
worthy of being a mother before.

1185
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:09,024
Yeah, but what makes you feel
like we're worthy now?

1186
01:08:11,024 --> 01:08:14,428
Shit. Look, I didn't mean
that you're not...

1187
01:08:15,428 --> 01:08:16,730
Amanda, I'm sorry,

1188
01:08:16,731 --> 01:08:18,765
but my feelings about this
still haven't changed.

1189
01:08:18,766 --> 01:08:20,266
Yeah.

1190
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:21,441
I thought we'd already...

1191
01:08:35,248 --> 01:08:37,059
The fire's
crowning along Jericho Road,

1192
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:38,951
running north.
We're gonna get in front,

1193
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:41,353
try to box her off and drive
her toward the canyon.

1194
01:08:41,354 --> 01:08:42,920
Copy, Granite Mountain.

1195
01:08:42,921 --> 01:08:46,590
We have a heavy air tanker
working in that area.

1196
01:08:46,591 --> 01:08:49,327
Assholes waited too long
to get a handle on this.

All right, guys.
First order of business,

1206
01:09:32,135 --> 01:09:33,635
I want to protect this
structure, and then we're gonna

1207
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,636
cut a line 30 feet off
the road, all right?

1208
01:09:35,637 --> 01:09:37,957
Hey, we're flying solo on this
one, so let's stay on point.

1209
01:09:38,106 --> 01:09:39,586
- Understood?
- You got it, Supe!

1210
01:09:42,177 --> 01:09:43,779
Shit, he doesn't know
we're here, man.

1211
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:44,780
Take cover! Take cover!

1212
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:57,792
Holy shit!

1213
01:10:03,163 --> 01:10:04,163
Whew!

1214
01:10:05,299 --> 01:10:06,965
So much for
protecting that structure.

1215
01:10:08,969 --> 01:10:10,803
- Y'all okay? Yeah?
- Everyone all right?

1216
01:10:10,804 --> 01:10:12,573
- Fine.
- Yeah.

1217
01:10:13,573 --> 01:10:14,573
All right, gear up.

1218
01:10:15,075 --> 01:10:16,742
Get to work.

1219
01:10:16,743 --> 01:10:18,977
Come on, let's go. Damn.

1220
01:10:18,978 --> 01:10:20,411
I'm heading out!

1221
01:10:20,412 --> 01:10:23,147
Why don't you have Marvel
set up the spare room for you?

1222
01:10:23,148 --> 01:10:25,217
Drive home in the morning.

1223
01:10:25,218 --> 01:10:27,352
Come on, it's a long drive
back to your place.

1224
01:10:27,353 --> 01:10:29,821
Thanks, Duane. I can't.

1225
01:10:29,822 --> 01:10:31,891
I got that big talk
at the ranch in the morning.

1226
01:10:31,892 --> 01:10:33,458
So, got to go back
and get ready.

1227
01:10:33,459 --> 01:10:35,792
Yeah, I'm sending some
people over to listen.

1228
01:10:35,793 --> 01:10:37,962
I'd appreciate that.

1229
01:10:37,963 --> 01:10:39,631
Could use some new clients.

1230
01:10:39,632 --> 01:10:40,417
Ah, you'll get 'em.

1231
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:46,570
All we're doing
is lacing together this fuel.

1232
01:10:46,571 --> 01:10:49,739
Just slow strokes,
back and forth.

1233
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:51,574
Wide spread.

1234
01:10:51,575 --> 01:10:53,210
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1235
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:54,651
- You sure? All right.
- Yeah.

1236
01:10:55,546 --> 01:10:57,747
I'll light you up.

1237
01:10:57,748 --> 01:10:59,949
Our last chain, all right?

1238
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:01,596
I'll be up the slope.

1239
01:11:12,595 --> 01:11:15,731
Hey, Supe! My torch!

1240
01:11:15,732 --> 01:11:17,370
Shit.

1241
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:20,259
What happened?

1242
01:11:20,284 --> 01:11:20,937
Hey, Supe?

1243
01:11:20,938 --> 01:11:22,405
I just tossed it.
It was freaking out.

1244
01:11:22,406 --> 01:11:23,571
It's all right.
It was a bad mix.

1245
01:11:23,572 --> 01:11:25,173
Steed, we're on our way out!

1246
01:11:25,174 --> 01:11:26,339
Hold off on the burners!

1247
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,508
Copy that.

1248
01:11:27,509 --> 01:11:29,349
Come on!

1249
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:53,169
Come on.

1250
01:11:55,169 --> 01:11:57,176
Whew!

1251
01:12:13,252 --> 01:12:14,752
Holy shit!

1252
01:12:14,753 --> 01:12:16,487
Yeah!

1253
01:12:16,488 --> 01:12:17,488
That's an 8.5.

1254
01:12:17,489 --> 01:12:18,622
No way.

1255
01:12:18,623 --> 01:12:19,623
The last one was better.

1256
01:12:21,093 --> 01:12:22,693
Oh, here she comes.

1257
01:12:22,694 --> 01:12:23,376
Yeah!

1258
01:12:23,401 --> 01:12:25,196
That's another one!

1259
01:12:27,567 --> 01:12:28,567
Shit!

1260
01:12:28,568 --> 01:12:29,733
Hey.

1261
01:12:29,734 --> 01:12:32,602
Hey, Supe, I just want to thank
you for pulling me out earlier.

1262
01:12:32,603 --> 01:12:34,905
It was definitely an ass-puckerer,
wasn't it?

1263
01:12:34,906 --> 01:12:38,308
No doubt, man.
I thought I was done.

1264
01:12:38,309 --> 01:12:39,910
If this ain't the greatest
job in the world,

1265
01:12:39,911 --> 01:12:41,411
I don't know what is.

1266
01:12:41,412 --> 01:12:42,780
You got that right, Supe.

1267
01:12:44,282 --> 01:12:45,281
Wait for it. Wait for it.

1268
01:12:50,754 --> 01:12:51,696
That's a 10!

1269
01:12:51,721 --> 01:12:52,588
Yeah!

1270
01:12:52,589 --> 01:12:54,289
That's a 10.

1271
01:13:00,231 --> 01:13:02,566
♪ Hello, my friend

1272
01:13:04,566 --> 01:13:06,738
♪ Can't sleep again

1273
01:13:08,738 --> 01:13:10,905
♪ Got too much on

1274
01:13:12,408 --> 01:13:13,477
♪ My mind... ♪

1275
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:27,555
All right, thanks for the ride.

1276
01:13:27,556 --> 01:13:29,858
You need anything,
give me a call.

1277
01:13:29,859 --> 01:13:31,358
Yeah.

1278
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:32,501
All right.

1279
01:13:44,339 --> 01:13:46,505
Confining a horse to a stall

1280
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:49,742
or a small paddock
inhibits blood flow,

1281
01:13:49,743 --> 01:13:52,477
and it damages receptors
in the hoof capsule.

1282
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,746
Horses are designed
for movement.

1283
01:14:00,687 --> 01:14:02,286
Depending on the damage,

1284
01:14:02,287 --> 01:14:05,026
I recommend a two-to-three-month
transition period.

1285
01:14:06,026 --> 01:14:07,025
Thanks for coming!

1286
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:08,231
Later!

1287
01:14:13,231 --> 01:14:15,633
Why didn't you call me?

1288
01:14:15,634 --> 01:14:17,435
Why do I have to find out
from Duane,

1289
01:14:17,436 --> 01:14:19,703
who found out
from a goddamn EMT?

1290
01:14:19,704 --> 01:14:21,638
Thought you were
out on the line.

1291
01:14:21,639 --> 01:14:22,639
Didn't want to worry you.

1292
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:23,707
Mmm-hmm.

1293
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:25,208
And I was fine. I am fine.

1294
01:14:25,209 --> 01:14:26,376
You're not...

1295
01:14:26,377 --> 01:14:28,378
Look at your face, your wrist.

1296
01:14:28,379 --> 01:14:29,779
- Look at the damn truck!
- No, no, no!

1297
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:31,213
Wait a minute!

1298
01:14:31,214 --> 01:14:33,751
You don't get to do this, okay?

1299
01:14:33,752 --> 01:14:36,452
I've had to learn how to live
my life without needing you,

1300
01:14:36,453 --> 01:14:38,093
and now you're pissed
at me because of it?

1301
01:14:39,056 --> 01:14:41,297
Screw that! You don't get
to have it both ways!

1302
01:14:48,297 --> 01:14:49,297
Hey, sweetie, come here.

1303
01:14:51,435 --> 01:14:53,368
Oh, no.

1304
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:56,038
It's okay.

1305
01:14:57,038 --> 01:14:59,741
Daddy can't get
a kiss from you? No?

1306
01:14:59,742 --> 01:15:03,911
Brendan, she's barely seen you
for the past few months.

1307
01:15:03,912 --> 01:15:06,915
Yeah, I know. It's been
a really tough season,

1308
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:10,486
and I'm, like, doing the best I can.
You know?

1309
01:15:10,487 --> 01:15:12,253
I know, but she doesn't
understand that.

1310
01:15:12,254 --> 01:15:13,954
You're doing great.

1311
01:15:13,955 --> 01:15:16,492
Young kids just
need consistency.

1312
01:15:21,361 --> 01:15:23,297
Yay!

1313
01:15:23,298 --> 01:15:24,798
Who's a big girl?

1314
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,335
Yeah, she is.

1315
01:15:29,469 --> 01:15:31,469
Look at you. What?

1316
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:33,907
What is that?

1317
01:15:33,908 --> 01:15:36,909
All right, we got a new
start-up by Granite Mountain.

1318
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:38,343
We're looking at the Doce Fire.

1319
01:15:38,344 --> 01:15:40,413
Started up 8 miles
southwest of town.

1320
01:15:40,414 --> 01:15:42,315
- Kicked up big last night.
- How big?

1321
01:15:42,316 --> 01:15:43,836
Over 1,000 acres burned already.

1322
01:15:44,017 --> 01:15:45,849
Burned through dry brush
straight towards town.

1323
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:47,952
We got a Red Flag Warning
in effect,

1324
01:15:47,953 --> 01:15:49,254
40 mile-per-hour wind gusts

1325
01:15:49,255 --> 01:15:52,357
and a relative humidity
as low as 3%.

1326
01:15:52,358 --> 01:15:54,260
- A real ass-kicker.
- Hell, yeah.

1327
01:15:54,261 --> 01:15:55,689
Two days off, right
back at it, boys.

1328
01:15:56,328 --> 01:15:58,697
Hey, guys, listen up.

1329
01:15:58,698 --> 01:16:01,531
The state has ordered
a management team.

1330
01:16:01,532 --> 01:16:03,567
IC has asked me to head up
Division Bravo,

1331
01:16:03,568 --> 01:16:06,637
so Steed is your Supe
on this next one.

1332
01:16:06,638 --> 01:16:07,507
Nice one. Yeah, Steed!

1333
01:16:08,506 --> 01:16:10,009
We got six
hotshot crews coming in.

1334
01:16:11,009 --> 01:16:12,477
What's our deal?

1335
01:16:12,478 --> 01:16:14,844
Well, no one knows this area
better than we do,

1336
01:16:14,845 --> 01:16:18,683
and that's why I'm giving
you guys a special assignment.

1337
01:16:25,054 --> 01:16:26,422
Fire's threatening Prescott,

1338
01:16:26,423 --> 01:16:28,391
and we get stuck on
some chicken-shit detail

1339
01:16:28,392 --> 01:16:30,227
- to protect a tree?
- Ah, it's lame, man.

1340
01:16:30,228 --> 01:16:33,295
Lame-ass tree is a national treasure.
It's over 2,000 years old.

1341
01:16:33,296 --> 01:16:35,696
But more importantly,
that tree is on our line.

1342
01:16:35,697 --> 01:16:38,333
If the fire gets past our line,
it goes to our town.

1343
01:16:38,334 --> 01:16:40,136
Quit your bitching, Turby.

1344
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:42,136
All right, well,
now I feel like an asshole.

1345
01:16:42,137 --> 01:16:43,905
You are.

1346
01:16:52,213 --> 01:16:53,747
Damn.

1347
01:16:53,748 --> 01:16:55,250
- Now, that's a tree.
- That's something.

1348
01:16:55,251 --> 01:16:57,318
That is definitely a tree.

1349
01:17:00,088 --> 01:17:02,355
Wow.

1350
01:17:02,356 --> 01:17:04,192
I thought
it was gonna be bigger.

1351
01:17:04,193 --> 01:17:05,759
All right.

1352
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,560
Let's prep 30 feet around her
and burn her off.

1353
01:17:07,561 --> 01:17:08,163
All right.

1354
01:17:08,188 --> 01:17:09,295
Come on, let's go to work!

1355
01:17:09,296 --> 01:17:10,296
Let's go, Alpha!

1356
01:17:11,032 --> 01:17:11,608
All right, let's move!

1357
01:17:11,633 --> 01:17:12,264
That's right, Donut.

1358
01:17:12,265 --> 01:17:13,532
Next tree, let's go.

1359
01:17:18,773 --> 01:17:20,877
Hey, Donut,
grab this other tree.

1360
01:17:22,876 --> 01:17:24,813
National treasure.

1361
01:17:26,813 --> 01:17:28,313
Take more, guys.
Take more.

1362
01:17:28,314 --> 01:17:29,882
Good job, Bravo.

1363
01:17:29,883 --> 01:17:31,383
Hey, tie it in and let's go.

1364
01:17:31,384 --> 01:17:32,664
Keep the line tight, move.

1365
01:17:35,421 --> 01:17:37,289
This is our front door
she's knocking on.

1366
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:38,590
- Come on, move.
- Yeah, let's go.

1367
01:17:38,591 --> 01:17:40,629
Let's get this nice, man.

1368
01:18:04,749 --> 01:18:06,122
Here she comes.

1369
01:18:31,974 --> 01:18:34,942
Spot fire! One scrape!

1370
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:35,628
Hey, I've got a spot!

1371
01:18:36,444 --> 01:18:37,444
I need two! Let's go!

1372
01:19:03,137 --> 01:19:05,638
Now that's what I call a line!

1373
01:19:05,639 --> 01:19:07,774
All right, guys,
let's mop it up!

1374
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:09,675
All right, Alpha!
Get it on!

1375
01:19:09,676 --> 01:19:10,676
- Let's go!
- Nice work!

1376
01:19:11,078 --> 01:19:12,311
- You heard him!
- Nice.

1377
01:19:12,312 --> 01:19:13,512
Little Woyjeck!

1378
01:19:13,513 --> 01:19:14,846
Bravo, let's go, with me!

1379
01:19:14,847 --> 01:19:16,282
That's you, bro.
Hey, nice work, nice work.

1380
01:19:16,283 --> 01:19:17,013
Let's get something to drink.

1381
01:19:17,038 --> 01:19:17,716
Bottoms up.

1382
01:19:17,717 --> 01:19:19,184
Move up the hill
and mop it up up here.

1383
01:19:19,185 --> 01:19:20,684
Alpha boys, let's go!

1384
01:19:20,685 --> 01:19:21,989
- Ready?
- Here we go.

1385
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,820
Hey, you're stepping
on my asshole.

1386
01:19:25,057 --> 01:19:26,730
- Come on.
- Tight.

1387
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:32,730
Granite Mountain on two.

1388
01:19:33,032 --> 01:19:33,612
One, two...

1389
01:19:34,565 --> 01:19:36,500
Granite Mountain!

1390
01:19:42,073 --> 01:19:44,375
Hey, man, how are
things with our little girl?

1391
01:19:44,376 --> 01:19:45,776
It's rough, man.

1392
01:19:45,777 --> 01:19:48,278
I mean, when we came back
from that last fire,

1393
01:19:48,279 --> 01:19:49,946
it's like she didn't
even recognize me.

1394
01:19:49,947 --> 01:19:53,749
But Steed and Turby
seem to have it figured out.

1395
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:56,518
You know, whatever that is,
I want a piece of it.

1396
01:19:57,921 --> 01:20:00,223
Oh! Dude!

1397
01:20:00,224 --> 01:20:01,691
- Shit.
- What?

1398
01:20:01,692 --> 01:20:03,959
Ah, dude.

1399
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,562
Oh, that's a rattler.

1400
01:20:05,563 --> 01:20:08,562
No way did that
just happen, man.

1401
01:20:08,563 --> 01:20:10,332
Where was your crew
working when you got bit?

1402
01:20:10,333 --> 01:20:13,836
We were cutting line around an
old tree near Granite Mountain.

1403
01:20:13,837 --> 01:20:15,337
The big juniper?

1404
01:20:15,338 --> 01:20:16,905
Yes, ma'am.

1405
01:20:16,906 --> 01:20:19,173
My husband proposed to
me under that tree.

1406
01:20:19,174 --> 01:20:20,464
Describe the pain, one to 10.

1407
01:20:20,489 --> 01:20:21,442
It's pretty bad.

1408
01:20:21,443 --> 01:20:23,177
It's, like, moving
up my leg right now.

1409
01:20:23,178 --> 01:20:25,613
So, Brendan, we're gonna
move you to another bed here.

1410
01:20:25,614 --> 01:20:29,022
Gonna need you just to relax,
let us do the lifting, okay?

1411
01:20:34,022 --> 01:20:35,689
Sir, I'm sorry, who are you?

1412
01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:39,125
I'm Eric Marsh, Granite
Mountain Superintendent.

1413
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:40,794
Hey, Donut, how you doing?

1414
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:43,796
I don't know. Ask them.

1417
01:20:46,934 --> 01:20:48,661
No, and I'd rather not.

1419

bullet for when you really need it.

1420
01:20:51,773 --> 01:20:54,108
Antibiotics and a morphine
drip will do the trick.

1421
01:20:54,109 --> 01:20:56,107
No, I don't want any morphine.

1422
01:20:56,108 --> 01:20:58,110
No painkillers, either.

1423
01:20:58,111 --> 01:20:59,812
The ride's gonna be
a lot rougher without them.

1424
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:00,775
Are you sure about that?

1425
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:01,800
Yeah, I'm sure.

1427

Uninformed on strategy,
tactics and hazards.

1428
01:21:12,424 --> 01:21:14,225
There it is.

1429
01:21:14,226 --> 01:21:15,759
You're gonna be fine.

1431
01:21:18,097 --> 01:21:20,130
I'll see you on the other side.
Hang in there.

1432
01:21:20,131 --> 01:21:22,536
Don't you worry about your boy.
We'll take good care of him.

1433
01:21:24,536 --> 01:21:26,706

Oh, the world's full of people
taking chances, Donut.

1591
01:27:57,071 --> 01:27:59,640
Jesus, Supe, why can't you
just say, "You're welcome"?

1592
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:02,374
'Cause I'm uncomfortable
with gratitude.

1593
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:03,742
I don't like it.

1594
01:28:03,743 --> 01:28:04,743
All right, well, too bad.

1595
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:07,580
That's what this is, gratitude.

1596
01:28:07,581 --> 01:28:09,215
Okay. All right.

1597
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:10,416
I can live with that, I guess.

1598
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:12,987
Oh, God.

1599
01:28:13,987 --> 01:28:15,522
So, we good?

1600
01:28:15,523 --> 01:28:18,522
There's something else I do
want to talk to you about.

1601
01:28:18,523 --> 01:28:21,659
I've been doing
a lot of thinking,

1602
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:24,161
and after this
fire season's over,

1603
01:28:24,162 --> 01:28:26,697
I want to move over
to the structure side.

1604
01:28:26,698 --> 01:28:31,637
And I was hoping maybe that you could put
in a good word with Chief Ellis for me.

1605
01:28:31,638 --> 01:28:32,637
Okay.

1606
01:28:33,338 --> 01:28:35,040
All right.

1607
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,642
All right, let me just
see if I got this down.

1608
01:28:38,643 --> 01:28:42,379
So, you brought me
out here to thank me

1609
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:44,347
for giving you a chance
that nobody

1610
01:28:44,348 --> 01:28:47,252
on the face of the fucking
Earth would give you,

1611
01:28:47,253 --> 01:28:49,852
and your way of
showing appreciation is

1612
01:28:49,853 --> 01:28:52,555
to then say to me that, what,

1613
01:28:52,556 --> 01:28:54,058
you're gonna quit on me
and this crew?

1614
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:11,674
Look, Supe,
I'm having a hard time.

1615
01:29:11,675 --> 01:29:13,774
It's tough.

1616
01:29:13,775 --> 01:29:16,377
I'm having a hard time being
a good dad and doing this job.

1617
01:29:16,378 --> 01:29:18,080
Okay, everybody's having
a hard time

1618
01:29:18,081 --> 01:29:20,448
because most of the men
on this crew have families.

1619
01:29:20,449 --> 01:29:22,216
And I don't hear any of them
bitching, do you?

1620
01:29:22,217 --> 01:29:24,085
Yeah, look, I can't
speak to that, okay?

1621
01:29:24,086 --> 01:29:24,860
I don't know. I...

1622
01:29:24,885 --> 01:29:25,719
No, you can't.

1623
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,121
I didn't have a dad growing up.

1624
01:29:27,122 --> 01:29:28,722
He wasn't around
for me, so when...

1625
01:29:28,723 --> 01:29:30,424
I'm not gonna do that
to my daughter, man.

1626
01:29:30,425 --> 01:29:31,425
- That's it.
- So what?

1627
01:29:33,228 --> 01:29:35,664
So what, Donut, huh?

1628
01:29:35,665 --> 01:29:37,598
I mean, do you think
anyone's gonna hire

1629
01:29:37,599 --> 01:29:39,432
a cheese-dick like you
on the structure side,

1630
01:29:39,433 --> 01:29:41,801
an asshole with
a record and a rep?

1631
01:29:41,802 --> 01:29:44,571
That's just never gonna happen.

1632
01:29:44,572 --> 01:29:46,472
And then what? Huh?

1633
01:29:46,473 --> 01:29:48,407
You're gonna be
washing dishes, miserable?

1634
01:29:48,408 --> 01:29:50,477
How long you think
you're gonna stay clean then?

1635
01:29:50,478 --> 01:29:53,848
Now, listen to me. Listen.

1636
01:29:54,847 --> 01:29:57,917
If you quit this crew,

1637
01:29:57,918 --> 01:30:00,963
you're gonna either end up
dead or behind bars.

1638
01:30:19,704 --> 01:30:22,106
♪ Copperhead Road

1639
01:30:22,107 --> 01:30:24,876
Hey, come on, let's go.
Come on.

1640
01:30:24,877 --> 01:30:25,683
Are you all right?

1641
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:27,005
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1642
01:30:30,981 --> 01:30:33,622
♪ Copperhead Road ♪

1643
01:30:50,233 --> 01:30:52,011
- Happens all the time.
- Yeah.

1644
01:30:52,035 --> 01:30:54,836
Guys are always leaving crews
because of family.

1645
01:30:54,837 --> 01:30:56,172
- Uh-huh.
- Right.

1646
01:30:56,173 --> 01:30:57,975
So why are you
so pissed at this kid?

1647
01:30:58,975 --> 01:31:01,442
'Cause a year ago he was a
junkie, tonight he's a hero.

1648
01:31:01,443 --> 01:31:02,610
Huh.

1649
01:31:02,611 --> 01:31:05,113
I mean, come on,
this job saved his life,

1650
01:31:05,114 --> 01:31:07,315
and now he'll probably end up
right back where he started.

1651
01:31:07,316 --> 01:31:08,717
Well, if you think
that he might relapse,

1652
01:31:08,718 --> 01:31:11,619
maybe you should take him
to a meeting with you.

1653
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:13,288
Does he even know
that you go to meetings?

1654
01:31:13,289 --> 01:31:14,789
It's nobody's business
but my own.

1655
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:16,157
Okay, so you're pissed
'cause you think

1656
01:31:16,158 --> 01:31:17,858
he owes the job something more
than his own daughter.

1657
01:31:17,859 --> 01:31:18,549
I didn't say that.

1658
01:31:18,574 --> 01:31:22,229
Oh, maybe it's 'cause he made
the choice that you're avoiding.

1659
01:31:22,230 --> 01:31:24,698
His thing has nothing
to do with me, okay?

1660
01:31:24,699 --> 01:31:25,943
I think it's got
everything to do with it.

1661
01:31:25,967 --> 01:31:27,734
No, no. I don't,
I don't want to do this.

1662
01:31:27,735 --> 01:31:29,837
Well, you know what?
You've had one day off

1663
01:31:29,838 --> 01:31:31,672
in the last month,
which you spent sleeping,

1664
01:31:31,673 --> 01:31:34,578
so when are we
supposed to do it?

1665
01:31:37,578 --> 01:31:39,077
What? What?

1666
01:31:39,078 --> 01:31:40,613
I'll tell you what!

1667
01:31:40,614 --> 01:31:43,215
You live your life
in a glass box

1668
01:31:43,216 --> 01:31:46,184
with a sign that says,
"Break in case of fire"!

1669
01:31:46,185 --> 01:31:48,023
You are 90% hotshot,
you are 10% mine,

1670
01:31:49,022 --> 01:31:50,722
and that is not enough!

1671
01:31:50,723 --> 01:31:52,390
What is that? Is that an ultimatum?
Is that what that...

1672
01:31:52,391 --> 01:31:54,526
No, I'm telling you how I feel,
and that's different.

1673
01:31:54,527 --> 01:31:56,561
I want a family
with the man that I love.

1674
01:31:56,562 --> 01:31:59,363
You knew exactly what the deal
was when we got into this, okay?

1675
01:31:59,364 --> 01:32:00,631
I've been straight with you...

1676
01:32:00,632 --> 01:32:01,872
Yeah, fine.
I don't give a shit!

1677
01:32:02,033 --> 01:32:03,369
From the first day that we met!

1678
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:04,635
We were in the same place then!

1679
01:32:04,636 --> 01:32:06,370
That was six years ago,

1680
01:32:06,371 --> 01:32:09,473
and people are supposed to be
changed by their relationships!

1681
01:32:09,474 --> 01:32:12,442
That's what happened to me!

1682
01:32:12,443 --> 01:32:14,777
I let you in!

1683
01:32:14,778 --> 01:32:16,116
I've been changed by you!

1684
01:32:17,116 --> 01:32:18,816
I'm a different person!

1685
01:32:18,817 --> 01:32:22,217
I have moved on from my
addiction, and you are still

1686
01:32:22,218 --> 01:32:25,129
fucking feeding yours
with another kind of drug!

1687
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:33,663
Where are you going?

1688
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:35,468
For a walk!

1689
01:32:57,118 --> 01:32:58,786
I didn't know who else to call.

1690
01:32:58,787 --> 01:33:00,161
Sit down.

1691
01:33:12,733 --> 01:33:14,502
Do you know
where I'm at right now?

1692
01:33:15,502 --> 01:33:16,502
Oh, yeah.

1693
01:33:17,971 --> 01:33:19,642
I've been there.

1694
01:33:22,009 --> 01:33:24,576
I don't know what to do.

1695
01:33:24,577 --> 01:33:26,282
Yeah, well,

1696
01:33:27,281 --> 01:33:29,647
you got to ask yourself,

1697
01:33:29,648 --> 01:33:35,022
"What can I live with
and what can I die without?"

1698
01:33:36,022 --> 01:33:38,457
You know what I mean?

1699
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:39,458
No, I don't.

1700
01:33:43,561 --> 01:33:44,561
Yeah.

1701
01:33:46,231 --> 01:33:47,231
I don't know.

1702
01:33:49,133 --> 01:33:52,837
You know, when I was
a Globe Hotshot...

1703
01:33:52,838 --> 01:33:55,739
Maybe 26, 27...

1704
01:33:57,009 --> 01:34:00,810
I worked this blaze
near Big Timber, Montana.

1705
01:34:00,811 --> 01:34:03,916
It was night, and
she just wasn't laying down.

1706
01:34:04,916 --> 01:34:08,184
Conditions going
from mean to wicked.

1707
01:34:08,185 --> 01:34:13,090
And me and my crew pulled back into
the black of this wide-open grassland

1708
01:34:13,091 --> 01:34:15,558
set right at the foot
of this sprawling forest,

1709
01:34:15,559 --> 01:34:18,427
just a few thousand acres
of tall, dense pine,

1710
01:34:18,428 --> 01:34:21,433
all of it green
and packed with resin.

1711
01:34:25,434 --> 01:34:28,005
And all of a sudden,

1712
01:34:29,005 --> 01:34:32,441
this savage wind kicked up,

1713
01:34:32,442 --> 01:34:37,512
and it carried with it this
tidal wave of brands and fire,

1714
01:34:37,513 --> 01:34:40,182
just sweeping through the trees.

1715
01:34:40,183 --> 01:34:44,352
And just in the blink
of an eye, the whole stretch

1716
01:34:44,353 --> 01:34:48,557
turned into a blast furnace,
just fire everywhere.

1717
01:34:50,557 --> 01:34:52,560
And then,

1718
01:34:52,561 --> 01:34:56,196
charging out of these flames,

1719
01:34:56,197 --> 01:35:00,203
all of a sudden comes this bear.

1720
01:35:01,203 --> 01:35:03,539
And the bear's on fire.

1721
01:35:04,539 --> 01:35:06,774
And he's running.

1722
01:35:07,774 --> 01:35:10,444
And he just barrels
right past us,

1723
01:35:11,444 --> 01:35:13,846
and keeps running,

1724
01:35:13,847 --> 01:35:16,252
hard-charging into the darkness.

1725
01:35:18,252 --> 01:35:20,355
That bear on fire

1726
01:35:22,354 --> 01:35:26,698
was the most beautiful and
terrible thing I've ever seen.

1727
01:35:32,698 --> 01:35:34,982
I'm feeling a lot like
that bear right now, Duane.

1728
01:36:20,342 --> 01:36:22,646
I'm yours.

1729
01:36:24,646 --> 01:36:26,547
I'm yours, Manda-bear.

1730
01:36:48,002 --> 01:36:50,170
Yeah, this is Marsh.

1731
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:51,705
Mmm-hmm.

1732
01:36:51,706 --> 01:36:52,706
Mmm-hmm.

1733
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:54,443
Okay.

1734
01:36:59,845 --> 01:37:01,481
Hey, Jesse.

1735
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:04,216
We got a new start down in Yarnell.
Lightning strike.

1736
01:37:04,217 --> 01:37:06,352
Yeah, go ahead, ring the bell.

1737
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:07,353
We'll see you in a few.

1738
01:37:09,356 --> 01:37:11,057
What's up?

1739
01:37:11,058 --> 01:37:13,691
Oh, a skunker down in Yarnell.

1740
01:37:13,692 --> 01:37:15,861
It's no big deal.

1741
01:37:16,861 --> 01:37:17,861
Kiss.

1742
01:37:19,665 --> 01:37:21,801
Yes, ma'am.

1743
01:37:22,801 --> 01:37:24,409
Hmm.

1744
01:37:30,409 --> 01:37:32,542
I love you, Shortstop.

1745
01:37:32,543 --> 01:37:34,043
You, too, Sugartits.

1746
01:37:35,846 --> 01:37:38,149
Go back to sleep.

1747
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:40,600
I'll probably be
home for dinner.

1748
01:38:02,707 --> 01:38:05,710
Not a skunker anymore, Supe.
She's moving fast.

1749
01:38:08,710 --> 01:38:11,416
Jesse, this is gonna be
my last year as Supe.

1750
01:38:13,416 --> 01:38:15,158
The job is yours if you want it.

1751
01:38:23,157 --> 01:38:25,325
Fire's threatening homes
in Peeples Valley,

1752
01:38:25,326 --> 01:38:27,628
so we've ordered
three more hotshot crews.

1753
01:38:27,629 --> 01:38:29,296
In the meantime,
I want Granite Mountain

1754
01:38:29,297 --> 01:38:32,498
to set an anchor here on the
southwest heel of the fire.

1755
01:38:32,499 --> 01:38:35,069
Keep it from running at Yarnell
if the weather shifts.

1756
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:36,637
Now, there's a safety zone here

1757
01:38:36,638 --> 01:38:40,673
at Boulder Springs Ranch,
fireproof, built of nonflammables.

1758
01:38:40,674 --> 01:38:42,009
The vegetation's been cleared.

1759
01:38:43,009 --> 01:38:44,644
- Ferguson?
- Yeah.

1760
01:38:44,645 --> 01:38:46,779
You and
Blue River will cut here,

1761
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:50,783
east of Marsh's crew, and your
fallback will be this two-track road.

1762
01:38:50,784 --> 01:38:53,585
We've established
three trigger points.

1763
01:38:53,586 --> 01:38:56,455
First trigger for Yarnell evac
should take an hour.

1764
01:38:56,456 --> 01:38:59,425
Second trigger,
all crews retreat.

1765
01:38:59,426 --> 01:39:00,426
Third,

1766
01:39:02,095 --> 01:39:04,564
no one should be
near Yarnell, okay?

1767
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:21,178
- Come on, keep it tight!
- Tight!

1768
01:39:21,179 --> 01:39:22,179
Tight!

1769
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:23,481
Tight.

1770
01:39:23,482 --> 01:39:24,482
Tight!

1771
01:39:24,483 --> 01:39:25,656
Tight!

1772
01:39:30,655 --> 01:39:32,088
- Steeder.
- Yo.

1773
01:39:32,089 --> 01:39:33,289
Tell me
we're gonna be off this shit

1774
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:34,356
and home by
tomorrow night. Please.

1775
01:39:34,357 --> 01:39:35,357
Hope so.

1776
01:39:35,927 --> 01:39:37,628
- He's got a big date.
- Yeah? With who?

1777
01:39:37,629 --> 01:39:39,862
That barely legal hottie
from the party?

1778
01:39:39,863 --> 01:39:42,164
That right? She got a sister?

1779
01:39:42,165 --> 01:39:45,133
Look, guys, back off.
He met a girl that he really likes.

1780
01:39:45,134 --> 01:39:46,534
No way. Who?

1781
01:39:46,535 --> 01:39:48,337
One of the nurses
who took care of me.

1782
01:39:48,338 --> 01:39:50,975
She's, like, 27,
gives a great IV.

1783
01:39:52,753 --> 01:39:53,708
She's nice.

1784
01:39:53,709 --> 01:39:55,778
- So, you closed?
- Like I said, brother.

1785
01:39:55,779 --> 01:39:57,512
Not like that.

1786
01:39:57,513 --> 01:39:59,848
What, is she playing
hard to get?

1787
01:39:59,849 --> 01:40:00,839
More like hard to forget.

1788
01:40:00,864 --> 01:40:01,750
Oh, that's, like,

1789
01:40:01,751 --> 01:40:04,085
the cutest thing I ever
heard you say, man.

1790
01:40:04,621 --> 01:40:05,319
I know, dude.

1791
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:08,422
This girl scares
the shit out of me.

1792
01:40:08,423 --> 01:40:10,591
That's good, brother.

1793
01:40:10,592 --> 01:40:11,719
That's how you know it's real.

1794
01:40:11,743 --> 01:40:12,693
Ah, shit.

1795
01:40:13,695 --> 01:40:14,729
Hey, hold up.

1796
01:40:14,730 --> 01:40:16,398
- Hold up.
- Hold up.

1797
01:40:17,398 --> 01:40:19,866
Gonna establish our anchor here.

1798
01:40:19,867 --> 01:40:21,837
Alpha down below,
Bravo upstairs.

1799
01:40:22,837 --> 01:40:25,908
Not even 10:00 a.m.,
105 and climbing.

1800
01:40:26,908 --> 01:40:28,774
Embrace the suck.

1801
01:40:34,982 --> 01:40:36,449
Operations,
this is Granite Mountain.

1802
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:39,084
We got clouds forming
above Peeples Valley.

1803
01:40:39,085 --> 01:40:41,605
They start to grow, the fire's
gonna get a lot worse real quick.

1804
01:40:41,955 --> 01:40:44,124
Our line's ready
to burn right now.

1805
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:45,791
Copy, Granite Mountain.

1806
01:40:45,792 --> 01:40:47,129
You got the green light to burn.

1807
01:40:49,128 --> 01:40:51,730
All right, copy that.

1808
01:40:52,732 --> 01:40:53,798
Tie it in!

1809
01:40:53,799 --> 01:40:55,299
Tied in.

1810
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:56,635
Tied in!

1811
01:40:56,636 --> 01:40:59,004
All right, Jesse, flip the torches,
get ready for a burn.

1812
01:41:00,004 --> 01:41:02,106
Copy.

1813
01:41:02,107 --> 01:41:03,775
Back to the anchor!

1814
01:41:03,776 --> 01:41:05,775
- Bravo Squad, swap that brush.
- Get ready to burn!

1815
01:41:05,778 --> 01:41:08,045
- Let's go, guys!
- Get ready to burn!

1816
01:41:08,046 --> 01:41:09,447
Uh, hey, Donut.

1817
01:41:09,448 --> 01:41:11,254
Come with me for a sec.

1818
01:41:16,254 --> 01:41:17,254
Listen, uh...

1819
01:41:20,058 --> 01:41:21,229
I'm sorry about last night.

1820
01:41:25,229 --> 01:41:29,131
Now, I don't know how to explain,
but sometimes we...

1821
01:41:29,132 --> 01:41:31,300
We don't see things as they are.

1822
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:35,404
You know, we see them as we are.

1823
01:41:35,405 --> 01:41:36,705
You understand that?

1824
01:41:36,706 --> 01:41:39,308
Yeah. Think so.

1825
01:41:39,309 --> 01:41:40,978
What happened wasn't about you.

1826
01:41:41,978 --> 01:41:43,084
It was about me.

1827
01:41:48,084 --> 01:41:49,723
I was you.

1828
01:41:53,722 --> 01:41:59,325
I will help you out in any way I
can, so long as you walk the line.

1829
01:41:59,326 --> 01:42:00,999
Do you hear me?

1830
01:42:03,999 --> 01:42:05,941
Thanks, Supe.

1831
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:14,677
All right.

1832
01:42:17,677 --> 01:42:19,111
Light it!

1833
01:42:19,112 --> 01:42:23,117
After we burn this off,
we head back down, boys.

1834
01:42:23,118 --> 01:42:25,119
Woyjeck, put more fuel down.

1835
01:42:26,118 --> 01:42:27,887
Watch for spots.

1836
01:42:28,887 --> 01:42:31,993
Burners,
pace off the guy on the line.

1837
01:42:34,993 --> 01:42:36,163
Shit!

1838
01:42:42,167 --> 01:42:43,867
- God!
- What an idiot!

1839
01:42:43,868 --> 01:42:45,303
Air Attack, Granite Mountain!

1840
01:42:45,304 --> 01:42:47,439
Your tanker just
dumped on our burn.

1841
01:42:48,439 --> 01:42:50,174
Repeat, Granite Mountain.

1842
01:42:50,175 --> 01:42:52,676
You're putting out
the wrong damn fires.

1843
01:42:52,677 --> 01:42:55,349
Hey, Supe, none of this shit's
gonna light off now.

1844
01:42:56,349 --> 01:42:58,714
What's your move?

1845
01:42:58,715 --> 01:43:00,717
All right, tie it off here.

1846
01:43:00,718 --> 01:43:02,889
Take the line
all the way up the ridge.

1847
01:43:04,889 --> 01:43:07,156
Hey, Donut, come here.

1848
01:43:07,157 --> 01:43:08,558
How's that leg, buddy?

1849
01:43:08,559 --> 01:43:10,627
Think you can handle a lookout?

1850
01:43:10,628 --> 01:43:11,628
Yeah.

1851
01:43:13,165 --> 01:43:14,696
Good spot right over there.

1852
01:43:14,697 --> 01:43:16,865
Just make sure you got
your weather kit handy.

1853
01:43:16,866 --> 01:43:18,801
Keep an eye on those clouds.

1854
01:43:18,802 --> 01:43:20,703
You got it, Supe.

1855
01:43:23,706 --> 01:43:25,240
Heard you on the TAC channel.

1856
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:27,041
- You moving the line?
- Yeah, next hill over.

1857
01:43:27,878 --> 01:43:30,213
Goddamn air tanker
really screwed the pooch.

1858
01:43:30,214 --> 01:43:33,347
We're moving to a secondary line,
but we'll adjust to you.

1859
01:43:33,348 --> 01:43:35,817
You mind taking my lookout,
Donut here, give him a lift?

1860
01:43:35,818 --> 01:43:38,853
No. Hop on.

1861
01:43:38,854 --> 01:43:41,193
- Cool to hop in the back?
- You got it.

1862
01:43:44,193 --> 01:43:45,193
All right.

1863
01:43:45,194 --> 01:43:46,360
See you later.

1864
01:43:46,361 --> 01:43:47,896
This side or the other, brother.

1865
01:43:48,896 --> 01:43:49,932
Later, Donut.

1866
01:43:51,932 --> 01:43:53,434
Don't miss me too much.

1867
01:43:53,435 --> 01:43:55,602
Get out of here, Donut!

1868
01:43:55,603 --> 01:43:58,315
Granite Mountain, line it up!

1869
01:44:08,314 --> 01:44:09,314
Thanks, man.

1870
01:44:09,315 --> 01:44:10,398
You got it.

1871
01:44:49,288 --> 01:44:52,123
Granite Mountain,
stand by for weather.

1872
01:44:52,124 --> 01:44:53,523
Yeah, how does it look?

1873
01:44:53,524 --> 01:44:55,125
Temp is 104,

1874
01:44:55,126 --> 01:44:57,594
RH 6%, so I'll keep
an eye on that.

1875
01:44:57,595 --> 01:44:59,828
Wind is 10 to 15 from the south,

1876
01:44:59,829 --> 01:45:01,764
and those clouds are building.

1877
01:45:01,765 --> 01:45:02,765
Yeah, I see 'em.

1878
01:45:02,934 --> 01:45:04,436
Keep an eye on it.

1879
01:45:13,109 --> 01:45:14,644
Shit.

1880
01:45:23,519 --> 01:45:25,120
Granite Mountain,
winds are changing here.

1881
01:45:25,121 --> 01:45:27,256
It's 25 to 35 from the north.

1882
01:45:28,256 --> 01:45:30,630
Yeah, we feel it.
What do you see?

1883
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:38,535
Fire's picking up, and it's
moving towards my location.

1884
01:45:39,535 --> 01:45:41,335
Okay, time for you
to get out of there, Donut.

1885
01:45:44,871 --> 01:45:46,272
It just hit the ridge.

1886
01:45:46,273 --> 01:45:47,507
I'm gonna make my way back
towards the dozer.

1887
01:45:47,508 --> 01:45:49,508
Copy that, Donut.

1888
01:46:08,328 --> 01:46:10,330
All right, hey,
I'm at the dozer.

1889
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:13,064
Copy.

1890
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:16,603
Hey, shit, man, it's too close.
I got to move!

1891
01:46:17,603 --> 01:46:19,237
Donut, stay calm.

1892
01:46:19,238 --> 01:46:21,406
Follow the two-track road.
That's your escape route.

1893
01:46:26,045 --> 01:46:27,612
Hey, my escape route's been...

1894
01:46:27,613 --> 01:46:29,013
Granite Mountain,
the fire just hit

1895
01:46:29,014 --> 01:46:31,848
the first trigger point
much faster than we expected.

1896
01:46:31,849 --> 01:46:33,719
We need to move.

1897
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:36,219
Ops, Granite Mountain.

1898
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:38,188
Dozer and retardant line
have been compromised.

1899
01:46:38,189 --> 01:46:40,557
- We're pulling back into the black.
- Copy.

1900
01:46:40,558 --> 01:46:42,078
Granite Mountain,
pack it up! Let's go!

1901
01:46:42,926 --> 01:46:44,061
Pack it up!

1902
01:46:48,232 --> 01:46:50,768
Donut, what's your position?

1903
01:46:51,768 --> 01:46:52,928
Come on, Donut, copy me, man.

1904
01:47:01,978 --> 01:47:03,150
Hey!

1905
01:47:07,149 --> 01:47:09,655
Heard you on the radio.

1906
01:47:12,655 --> 01:47:15,190
Boys, I've got your lookout.
Fire's making its push.

1907
01:47:15,191 --> 01:47:16,831
We're gonna go back and bump
your buggies.

1908
01:47:16,926 --> 01:47:20,193
Copy that. Thanks for
looking out for our boy.

1909
01:47:20,194 --> 01:47:21,834
I'm gonna go up top,
take a look up there.

1910
01:47:21,895 --> 01:47:24,098
Copy.

1911
01:47:24,099 --> 01:47:27,233
Blue River,
can you burn your line off?

1912
01:47:27,234 --> 01:47:28,274
Negative. Line is overrun.

1913
01:47:28,869 --> 01:47:30,571
- Pulling back to Yarnell.
- Copy.

1914
01:47:30,572 --> 01:47:32,406
You get your Supe truck.
We got your buggies.

1915
01:47:32,407 --> 01:47:34,282
Let's go.

1916
01:47:48,921 --> 01:47:50,255
Granite Mountain, Operations.

1917
01:47:50,256 --> 01:47:51,256
What's your position?

1918
01:47:51,891 --> 01:47:53,224
Ops, Granite Mountain.

1919
01:47:53,225 --> 01:47:55,662
- Still holding in the black.
- Copy that.

1920
01:47:56,662 --> 01:47:57,897
Hey, so, uh...

1921
01:47:58,897 --> 01:48:01,299
Next Thursday,
my band's playing.

1922
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:02,945
- Ooh, yeah, sorry, got a thing.
- Don't...

1923
01:48:02,969 --> 01:48:04,409
With your immediate
negativity, okay?

1924
01:48:04,970 --> 01:48:06,210
We're not coming, dude.

1925
01:48:06,939 --> 01:48:09,978
- Why not?
- Because the Firelords suck ass, man. They're terrible.

1926
01:48:10,941 --> 01:48:13,177
We're not the
Firelords anymore, okay?

1927
01:48:13,178 --> 01:48:14,812
- We changed it.
- Yeah?

1928
01:48:14,813 --> 01:48:16,547
- To what?
- Hour of the Wolf.

1929
01:48:16,548 --> 01:48:17,548
Still suck.

1930
01:48:18,717 --> 01:48:21,052
If it was the other way around,
I'd be there supporting each of you guys.

1931
01:48:21,053 --> 01:48:22,619
Oh, boo!

1932
01:48:23,653 --> 01:48:24,555
Fine, fine.

1933
01:48:24,556 --> 01:48:25,723
Brewskies are on me.

1934
01:48:26,723 --> 01:48:28,358
- Yeah!
- Oh!

1935
01:48:28,359 --> 01:48:29,359
Suddenly we're free.

1936
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:31,060
Air Attack, Operations.

1937
01:48:31,061 --> 01:48:32,461
Where are those
heavy air tankers?

1938
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:35,198
They're inbound,
but still 10 minutes out.

1939
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:36,279
Come on, knock it out, man!

1940
01:48:42,972 --> 01:48:45,253
Granite Mountain,
can you redeploy to Yarnell?

1941
01:48:45,908 --> 01:48:47,979
The fire's advancing
on trigger point two.

1942
01:48:48,979 --> 01:48:51,581
How long is he gonna
keep us safe in the black?

1943
01:48:51,582 --> 01:48:53,148
I mean it, Jesse,
I don't want to stand around

1944
01:48:53,149 --> 01:48:55,483
like a worthless piece of shit
while this town burns.

1945
01:48:55,484 --> 01:48:57,718
Easy, brother.

1946
01:48:57,719 --> 01:48:59,322
None of us do.

1947
01:49:00,322 --> 01:49:02,990
Steeder.

1948
01:49:02,991 --> 01:49:04,433
What's the plan here?

1949
01:49:11,433 --> 01:49:13,767
Well,

1950
01:49:13,768 --> 01:49:17,309
they're not doing anything to
slow you down at all, are they?

1951
01:49:22,309 --> 01:49:26,178
Air Attack, Granite Mountain. What's
the status on the air tankers?

1952
01:49:26,179 --> 01:49:29,048
Granite Mountain,
air tankers have been delayed.

1953
01:49:29,049 --> 01:49:30,815
We got homes burning in Yarnell,

1954
01:49:30,816 --> 01:49:33,261
and base camp's being pushed.

1955
01:49:41,261 --> 01:49:42,761
Jesse, I think we should move on

1956
01:49:42,762 --> 01:49:45,198
to our escape route,
head down to the ranch

1957
01:49:45,199 --> 01:49:46,997
and work the fire from there.

1958
01:49:46,998 --> 01:49:49,001
We're the only crew in
position to save these homes.

1959
01:49:49,002 --> 01:49:51,002
You and the boys down
for getting back in the game?

1960
01:49:53,939 --> 01:49:55,706
You guys hear that?

1961
01:49:55,707 --> 01:49:56,604
Let's go to work, Supe.

1962
01:49:56,629 --> 01:49:58,009
All right, back to work, boys.

1963
01:49:58,010 --> 01:49:58,687
Back to work.

1964
01:49:58,712 --> 01:49:59,676
Come on, man,

1965
01:49:59,677 --> 01:50:00,417
this is what we were born to do.

1966
01:50:00,442 --> 01:50:01,113
Let's break a sweat, boys.

1967
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:03,451
Let's get it!

1968
01:50:06,451 --> 01:50:08,451
- What?
- Let's put this bad boy out.

1969
01:50:10,421 --> 01:50:12,255
Let's go, Ashcraft!

1970
01:50:12,256 --> 01:50:14,224
Ops, Granite Mountain.

1971
01:50:14,225 --> 01:50:16,559
I want to pass on that we're gonna
make our way toward our escape route.

1972
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,361
You guys
are in the black, correct?

1973
01:50:18,362 --> 01:50:20,096
Yep. We're gonna pick our way
through the black,

1974
01:50:20,097 --> 01:50:21,597
and then on toward the ranch.

1975
01:50:21,598 --> 01:50:23,737
Copy that.

1976
01:50:26,737 --> 01:50:29,472
Donut, fire just hit trigger
point two. We're pulling back

1977
01:50:29,473 --> 01:50:30,323
to the restaurant.

1978
01:50:30,348 --> 01:50:31,434
Copy, Blue River.

1979
01:50:48,757 --> 01:50:50,158
Ops, Granite Mountain.

1980
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:52,993
We're going down our escape
route to our safety zone.

1981
01:50:52,994 --> 01:50:54,765
Is everything okay?

1982
01:50:56,765 --> 01:50:58,299
Yeah.

1983
01:50:58,300 --> 01:50:59,300
We're just moving.

1984
01:50:59,301 --> 01:51:00,522
Copy.

1985
01:51:21,521 --> 01:51:24,157
Steed, you with me?

1986
01:51:24,158 --> 01:51:26,657
Yeah, we're with you.
Coming off the black and into the canyon.

1987
01:51:26,658 --> 01:51:29,461
I'm almost at the ranch.
Looks good.

1988
01:51:29,462 --> 01:51:31,332
Be able to reengage
the fire from there.

1989
01:51:33,332 --> 01:51:36,035
All right, guys.
Keep the pace and watch your footing.

1990
01:51:36,036 --> 01:51:37,436
Watch your footing.

1991
01:51:37,437 --> 01:51:38,937
Watch your footing.

1992
01:51:38,938 --> 01:51:40,806
Watch your footing.

1993
01:51:42,674 --> 01:51:44,342
Come on through.

1994
01:51:44,343 --> 01:51:46,052
You, too. Let's go.

1995
01:51:53,052 --> 01:51:54,052
Hey, how can I help?

1996
01:51:54,053 --> 01:51:55,652
Just wait here with my crew.

1997
01:51:55,653 --> 01:51:57,787
I'm gonna check in
with Operations to get orders.

1998
01:51:57,788 --> 01:51:59,788
All right.
Hey, thanks for picking me up.

1999
01:51:59,789 --> 01:52:01,289
I owe you one.

2000
01:52:01,290 --> 01:52:02,830
Just sit tight, all right?

2001
01:52:06,830 --> 01:52:08,731
Air Attack, Operations.

2002
01:52:08,732 --> 01:52:11,033
We've got a storm cell
that's developed to the north

2003
01:52:11,034 --> 01:52:13,568
with heavy wind gusts
toward the southwest.

2004
01:52:13,569 --> 01:52:16,471
Fire has just hit
trigger point three.

2005
01:52:16,472 --> 01:52:17,742
It's making a run.

2006
01:52:29,519 --> 01:52:33,089
I copy, yeah.
We're getting 50-mile-an-hour wind gusts here.

2007
01:52:34,089 --> 01:52:35,089
Oh...

2008
01:52:59,580 --> 01:53:00,580
Hey, Supe!

2009
01:53:02,217 --> 01:53:05,150
Prepare deployment
site right here. Now!

2010
01:53:05,151 --> 01:53:06,785
We can't go back up there.

2011
01:53:06,786 --> 01:53:09,555
There's no time, Jesse.

2012
01:53:09,556 --> 01:53:12,492
Deployment site! Right here, right now!
Let's go!

2013
01:53:12,493 --> 01:53:13,493
Deployment site!

2014
01:53:13,494 --> 01:53:14,827
Deployment site!

2015
01:53:14,828 --> 01:53:17,497
Breaking in on Arizona 16!
Granite Mountain Hotshots!

2016
01:53:17,498 --> 01:53:19,403
We are in front
of the flaming front!

2017
01:53:29,041 --> 01:53:30,041
Burning!

2018
01:53:30,042 --> 01:53:31,775
Burning!

2019
01:53:31,776 --> 01:53:33,545
Burn around the perimeter!

2020
01:53:33,546 --> 01:53:35,713
Ashcraft, next tree!

2021
01:53:35,714 --> 01:53:38,282
Granite Mountain, we're
gonna bring you the air tanker, okay?

2022
01:53:38,283 --> 01:53:41,551
You got it! That's exactly
where we want the drop!

2023
01:53:41,552 --> 01:53:43,120
Operations, Air Attack.

2024
01:53:43,121 --> 01:53:46,323
Do you have a firm location
on Granite Mountain?

2025
01:53:46,324 --> 01:53:48,244
Air Attack, Granite Mountain.
How do you read me?

2026
01:53:51,996 --> 01:53:53,763
Air Attack, Granite Mountain!

2027
01:53:53,764 --> 01:53:55,644
Drop!

2028
01:54:10,914 --> 01:54:13,414
Air Attack, Granite Mountain.

2029
01:54:13,415 --> 01:54:16,985
Okay,
Granite Mountain. Air Attack.

2030
01:54:16,986 --> 01:54:18,986
Okay, I'm here with
Granite Mountain Hotshots,

2031
01:54:18,987 --> 01:54:20,467
and our escape route
has been cut off.

2032
01:54:20,857 --> 01:54:21,857
Come on, man.

2033
01:54:21,858 --> 01:54:23,825
We are preparing
a deployment site.

2034
01:54:23,826 --> 01:54:27,362
We are burning out
around ourselves...

2035
01:54:27,363 --> 01:54:29,529
In the brush.

2036
01:54:29,530 --> 01:54:32,033
And I'll call you
when we're under our...

2037
01:54:32,034 --> 01:54:33,479
The shelters.

2038
01:54:44,478 --> 01:54:46,313
Okay, copy that.

2039
01:54:46,314 --> 01:54:48,715
So, you're on the south side
of the fire, then?

2040
01:54:48,716 --> 01:54:49,716
Affirm!

2041
01:54:54,087 --> 01:54:55,322
Deploy!

2042
01:54:55,323 --> 01:54:56,323
Deploy!

2043
01:54:56,324 --> 01:54:57,388
Deploy!

2044
01:55:06,866 --> 01:55:08,599
Get your feet to the fire!

2045
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:10,670
Water! Get your water!

2046
01:55:10,671 --> 01:55:12,403
Feet to the fire!

2047
01:55:12,404 --> 01:55:14,237
Rookies on the inside!

2048
01:55:14,238 --> 01:55:15,238
Jesse!

2049
01:55:15,239 --> 01:55:16,673
What?

2050
01:55:16,674 --> 01:55:18,683
You, too!

2051
01:55:49,571 --> 01:55:53,176
Oh, God. God, help me.

2052
01:55:54,176 --> 01:55:55,176
Mack?

2053
01:55:57,047 --> 01:55:58,382
It's gonna be okay!

2054
01:55:59,382 --> 01:56:02,750
Okay. Okay.

2055
01:56:20,367 --> 01:56:21,911
Granite Mountain, Operations.

2056
01:56:21,935 --> 01:56:23,536
Now, I need you
to pay attention.

2057
01:56:23,537 --> 01:56:26,373
And tell me when
you hear the aircraft, okay?

2058
01:56:26,374 --> 01:56:28,741
'Cause it's gonna be a little
tough for us to see you.

2059
01:56:34,049 --> 01:56:37,516
Okay, we're working
our way around there.

2060
01:56:37,517 --> 01:56:41,186
We've got several aircraft
coming to you.

2061
01:56:41,187 --> 01:56:43,623
I'll see if we can't
take care of business for you.

2062
01:56:46,959 --> 01:56:49,294
Granite Mountain,
do you hear a helicopter?

2063
01:57:44,179 --> 01:57:45,282
I got eyes! I got eyes!

2064
01:58:33,492 --> 01:58:34,993
Operations.

2065
01:58:34,994 --> 01:58:36,474
Yeah, go ahead.

2066
01:58:36,930 --> 01:58:39,365
Uh, medic on scene.

2067
01:58:39,366 --> 01:58:42,041
Nineteen, confirmed.

2068
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:50,642
Okay, I copy.

2069
01:58:50,643 --> 01:58:52,977
Let's go ahead
and obviously secure the area.

2070
01:58:52,978 --> 01:58:55,246
We'll go from there.

2071
01:59:07,959 --> 01:59:10,508
No, no, no, no!

2072
01:59:45,761 --> 01:59:48,464
Bringing all the families
over to Prescott Middle School.

2073
01:59:48,465 --> 01:59:50,269
Setting up a whole thing
for the fallout.

2074
01:59:53,268 --> 01:59:55,639
That's where I want to go.

2075
01:59:57,639 --> 02:00:00,279
I don't think that's a
good idea, Brendan.

2076
02:00:00,742 --> 02:00:02,102
Let me just take you
to your mom's.

2077
02:00:04,946 --> 02:00:06,250
Take me to the gym.

2078
02:00:13,853 --> 02:00:15,355
- Yeah?
- Duane,

2079
02:00:15,356 --> 02:00:17,155
I just talked to the sheriff.

2080
02:00:17,156 --> 02:00:18,259
He's saying 19.

2081
02:00:19,259 --> 02:00:20,459
You're sure?

2082
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:22,027
I'm afraid so.

2083
02:00:22,028 --> 02:00:24,363
But he told me that
one of them got out okay.

2084
02:00:24,364 --> 02:00:26,597
Is that confirmed?

2085
02:00:26,598 --> 02:00:29,467
I don't know.
I'm so sorry, Duane.

2086
02:00:29,468 --> 02:00:31,542
I know.
Thank you, Kathy.

2087
02:00:35,542 --> 02:00:37,108
Duane.

2088
02:00:42,847 --> 02:00:46,183
It's just not good.

2089
02:00:46,184 --> 02:00:49,322
Oh, no. No.

2090
02:01:19,515 --> 02:01:21,083
Duane.

2091
02:01:21,084 --> 02:01:23,518
Duane, what's going on?

2092
02:01:23,519 --> 02:01:25,187
- Are they okay?
- I'm gonna find out right now.

2093
02:01:25,188 --> 02:01:27,795
Please, just hold on.

2094
02:01:31,794 --> 02:01:35,463
Huck, what's going on?
What did you tell these people?

2095
02:01:35,464 --> 02:01:37,031
Nothing.

2096
02:01:37,032 --> 02:01:39,200
We can't tell them until
the grief counselors get here.

2097
02:01:39,201 --> 02:01:40,968
- Well, how long?
- Twenty minutes.

2098
02:01:40,969 --> 02:01:42,369
They're driving in from Phoenix.

2099
02:01:42,370 --> 02:01:45,305
We heard there was
one survivor. Is that true?

2100
02:01:45,306 --> 02:01:49,342
Would you please tell me if
my husband is alive or dead?

2101
02:01:58,619 --> 02:01:59,857
Okay, hold on, now.

2102
02:03:10,787 --> 02:03:13,337
Brendan, come on.
Let me get you home.

2103
02:03:29,336 --> 02:03:30,806
Brendan.

2104
02:03:31,806 --> 02:03:32,976
Brendan!

2105
02:03:39,346 --> 02:03:41,317
- Should have been me.
- No.

2106
02:03:43,317 --> 02:03:45,017
Yeah, he was better than me.

2107
02:03:45,018 --> 02:03:47,754
- They were all better than me.
