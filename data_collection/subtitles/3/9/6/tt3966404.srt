1
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:12,681
It's like everything
changed in the blink of an eye.

2
00:01:12,848 --> 00:01:14,556
One moment we were fine,

3
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:17,556
then everything turned to shit.

4
00:01:27,223 --> 00:01:29,181
My little one...

5
00:01:29,848 --> 00:01:32,390
I'm going to miss you all.

6
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:34,681
Look at me.

7
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:39,973
We'll write to each other.
You have my address,

8
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,265
don't you?

9
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:44,306
Then everything's fine.

10
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:48,390
Off you go.

11
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:03,015
We'll all miss you, Teacher Dilek.

12
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:08,473
- Good luck in Istanbul.
- Give your mother my best.

13
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:11,138
Have a good holiday, Miss.

14
00:02:14,306 --> 00:02:15,640
You're all sad.

15
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,015
Come here.

16
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:25,556
Selma,

17
00:02:25,723 --> 00:02:28,015
the sun's out, let's walk.

18
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:41,806
Lale!

19
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,806
Don't splash me!

20
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:15,015
Ready?

21
00:03:37,306 --> 00:03:38,390
Stop it!

22
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,473
We win!

23
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:48,098
What?

24
00:03:48,515 --> 00:03:50,598
- My turn again!
- No way.

25
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:52,056
I want another go.

26
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:53,765
No way!

27
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:56,306
You cheated.

28
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:58,890
No, we didn't.

29
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:02,848
It's not fair.

30
00:04:03,015 --> 00:04:05,390
- You cheated!
- No, we never!

31
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:06,848
Give her another go.

32
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:08,598
Everyone gets just one go.

33
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:10,556
Take your turn!

34
00:04:12,806 --> 00:04:13,931
Let me go!

35
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:15,473
Let me go!

36
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,640
I can't reach.

37
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:03,515
I was going to help you.

38
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:12,973
Look, they've grown all of a sudden!

39
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,765
Show me your boobs.

40
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,598
What are you doing in my garden!
Clear off!

41
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:24,890
We've only taken a few apples.

42
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:29,015
Get out of my garden!

43
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:31,223
- OK, we're going.
- Calm down.

44
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:52,556
Sonay,

45
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:54,848
as you're the eldest,

46
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:57,265
I'll start with you.

47
00:05:57,598 --> 00:05:58,598
Grandma!

48
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:01,056
Sonay!

49
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:03,348
Grandma, open the door!

50
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:04,473
Grandma?

51
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:06,681
Sonay, are you OK?

52
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:10,515
Your turn now.

53
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:11,681
Selma!

54
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,681
Open the door!

55
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:16,348
Grandma, open up!

56
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,431
Grandma, open the door!

57
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:29,681
- Get out!
- What's this all about?

58
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,556
- Ece, come here.
- What did we do?

59
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,223
It was just a few apples.

60
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,348
Everyone's talking
about your obscene behaviour.

61
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:40,515
What?

62
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:42,931
Rubbing up against boys' necks.

63
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:44,056
What?

64
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:45,765
On the beach.

65
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,056
Rubbing your parts on boys' necks!

66
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:52,140
We were on their shoulders,
it was a game...

67
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:54,098
There's no such game!

68
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:55,723
Who told you this?

69
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,765
- Ece, come here.
- Who told you?

70
00:06:57,931 --> 00:06:58,973
Come here!

71
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:05,556
Mrs Petek called me
to tell me what you were up to.

72
00:07:05,723 --> 00:07:07,140
How could she?

73
00:07:07,306 --> 00:07:10,265
My granddaughters,
pleasuring themselves on boys' necks!

74
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,723
What?

75
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:15,015
You're depraved!

76
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:16,806
Come here!

77
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,056
Get out!

78
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:20,390
I can't watch you all day long.

79
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:22,098
You're disgusting!

80
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:24,098
Get back!

81
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:26,598
Grandma, stop it!

82
00:07:29,806 --> 00:07:31,515
Nur, what are you doing?

83
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:43,140
What are you doing?

84
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,556
These chairs touched our arseholes!
That's disgusting!

85
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:48,181
Have you gone mad?

86
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,890
Come here!

87
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,473
Come back!

88
00:07:56,473 --> 00:07:57,848
Mrs Petek!

89
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,015
Girls!

90
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:22,306
Mrs Petek's at the market.

91
00:08:26,765 --> 00:08:27,890
Lale!

92
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:31,181
Mrs Petek!

93
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:36,348
Do your shit-coloured clothes
make you everyone's moral judge?

94
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,015
What are you doing?

95
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:44,515
I did it for your own good.

96
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:45,723
No.

97
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,056
Yes.

98
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:49,515
I'm sorry, Mrs Petek.

99
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:52,390
Please forgive them.

100
00:08:55,765 --> 00:08:56,973
Straight home!

101
00:08:57,931 --> 00:08:59,056
Now!

102
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,681
What am I going to do with you?

103
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,348
That's enough, Mum.

104
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:14,515
Enough!

105
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:17,265
You've been saying that for years.

106
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,223
"Give them their freedom,
they're just children."

107
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,931
- It's true.
- What's true?

108
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:27,806
Their parents have been dead
a decade now.

109
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:31,765
- Be more understanding...
- About what?

110
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:33,015
They've grown up.

111
00:09:33,431 --> 00:09:34,681
Can't you see?

112
00:09:34,848 --> 00:09:36,640
You know what people are saying?

113
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:38,848
Don't listen to gossip.

114
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:40,681
Do you know what they do?

115
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:43,015
You think you're helping them?

116
00:09:43,973 --> 00:09:46,556
How can you talk like this
to your own mother?

117
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:47,973
I'll show them!

118
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:49,640
Where are they?

119
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,556
Watch your language.

120
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:53,348
Lale, Nur, out!

121
00:09:53,515 --> 00:09:54,598
Out!

122
00:09:55,806 --> 00:09:56,723
Calm down.

123
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:59,056
Which one is it?

124
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,515
- Calm down.
- Or is it all of you?

125
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:03,306
- Which one?
- Calm down.

126
00:10:03,473 --> 00:10:06,515
Which one acts like a whore?
Or is it all of you?

127
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:09,681
Teasing the boys, eh?
Is it you?

128
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:18,056
Mum!

129
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:22,598
- They've done nothing wrong!
- How do you know?

130
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:26,056
- I know.
- How can you be so sure?

131
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,306
They're my granddaughters.

132
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:31,890
If they're sullied, it's your fault.

133
00:10:32,473 --> 00:10:33,931
I'll prove it to you.

134
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:35,931
Calm down.

135
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:39,223
They've always done just what they want.

136
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,723
- How can you fix that?
- Do you think it's easy?

137
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,181
I lost my sons.

138
00:10:45,348 --> 00:10:48,848
I understand.
But it was a long time ago now.

139
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,515
Pull yourself together.

140
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:53,348
I've raised them
by myself for years.

141
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:56,056
I understand.

142
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,598
But Erol is right.

143
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:01,181
He has every reason to be angry.

144
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:04,723
It's come to this
because you didn't do your job right.

145
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:25,223
What are you looking at?
Spit out that gum!

146
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,390
Ece, Sonay, Selma, come with me.

147
00:11:51,098 --> 00:11:52,015
Selma.

148
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:55,515
- What did they do?
- A virginity report.

149
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:56,765
What's that?

150
00:11:56,931 --> 00:11:59,681
- Did you strip naked for the doctor?
- Yes.

151
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:03,723
He said I had nothing
he hadn't seen before.

152
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,765
It's true.

153
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,890
We're all made the same.

154
00:12:08,765 --> 00:12:12,098
No. You've got one boob
bigger than the other!

155
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,848
We didn't need to go to the doctor's.

156
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:44,598
We told you.

157
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,140
If there was the slightest doubt,

158
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:49,473
you'd never be able to get married.

159
00:12:53,848 --> 00:12:57,640
After that, the doors to the house
were always locked.

160
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,181
Anything likely to pervert us
was banned.

161
00:13:59,348 --> 00:14:00,806
What?

162
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:02,723
Which road?

163
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:04,723
All right.

164
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,015
The bastards!

165
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:21,640
Mum, will you take these girls in hand,
or do I have to?

166
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:25,473
Sonay, you're mine

167
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:42,556
Welcome!

168
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,723
- Jump...
- I'm going to fall!

169
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,306
You won't fall.

170
00:14:54,598 --> 00:14:55,598
She's falling.

171
00:14:57,765 --> 00:14:59,473
My baby's born!

172
00:15:02,056 --> 00:15:03,306
Move your feet!

173
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:05,473
Your order is here.

174
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,223
Your toe dessert from foot world!

175
00:15:10,306 --> 00:15:13,556
- I didn't order anything.
- It's your order!

176
00:15:13,723 --> 00:15:16,306
There's been a mistake.

177
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:18,223
A mistake?

178
00:15:18,806 --> 00:15:22,931
Put a vine leaf on your plate...

179
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:27,556
The house became a wife factory,

180
00:15:27,723 --> 00:15:29,515
that we never came out of.

181
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,265
Watch...

182
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:38,973
If you overstuff them, they go soft,
which isn't good.

183
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,681
No one likes a soft dolma.

184
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:42,515
Don't burst the peppers.

185
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:45,515
It has to be nice and round.

186
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:47,556
Watch carefully.

187
00:15:48,431 --> 00:15:50,265
Yes, you're doing it well.

188
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:52,765
That's very good.

189
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,848
There's nothing you can't do.

190
00:15:55,181 --> 00:15:58,723
Keep turning it.

191
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,681
You watched me do it, right?

192
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:02,931
There, that'll be perfectly round.

193
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,473
Well done.

194
00:16:09,181 --> 00:16:10,556
Shall we show the others?

195
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:12,556
Straight towards you.

196
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:18,390
You'll all learn how to do this.

197
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:20,848
Careful with the knife.

198
00:16:22,306 --> 00:16:24,765
Ece, it's your turn.

199
00:16:28,681 --> 00:16:31,265
Well done, girls.

200
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:36,598
Spread it out evenly.

201
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:30,223
Come here.

202
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:39,931
Now it was our turn to wear
shapeless, shit-coloured dresses.

203
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,598
A few basic principles about soup.

204
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:51,765
Made from a proper broth,
it has more taste.

205
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:55,556
You can also improve the flavour
and nutritional value

206
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:58,056
with certain preparations.

207
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,848
In front of my house!

208
00:18:04,723 --> 00:18:05,890
I'll kill him!

209
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,515
"Sonay, you're mine"?

210
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:27,973
Lale!

211
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:30,431
That's enough! Get out!

212
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,890
What are you doing here?

213
00:18:47,098 --> 00:18:49,931
Once the milk
takes on this consistency,

214
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:53,223
add the sugar and the gum.

215
00:18:53,681 --> 00:18:56,806
A measure of salep...

216
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:01,140
Pour it into these moulds,

217
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:04,181
put it in the fridge,

218
00:19:04,348 --> 00:19:05,890
and once it's cooled

219
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:08,348
you'll have chewing-gum!

220
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:15,390
I'm going to faint!

221
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:17,098
Help, I'm stuck!

222
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:18,723
Hang on...

223
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:23,390
Watch it!

224
00:19:23,556 --> 00:19:26,098
How are we going
to get the dress back?

225
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,640
Did it fly out?

226
00:19:30,223 --> 00:19:31,556
What's that?

227
00:19:31,723 --> 00:19:32,806
Chewing-gum.

228
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:35,015
Really? Where did you get it?

229
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:37,348
- We made it.
- How?

230
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,890
The best chewing-gum ever!

231
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:50,598
It's a bit sticky.

232
00:19:50,765 --> 00:19:51,723
You know what?

233
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:54,390
We can improve these dresses.

234
00:19:58,056 --> 00:19:59,431
That's better.

235
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,515
- Nice.
- Tear it a bit more.

236
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:02,973
All the way up.

237
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:06,306
Wear it like that.

238
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:08,681
- Strike a pose!
- Like this?

239
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,390
Ouch, my ear!

240
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,431
Where did you go?

241
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:38,806
The beach.

242
00:21:39,223 --> 00:21:41,140
What were you doing at the beach?

243
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:42,973
Mind your own business.

244
00:21:57,973 --> 00:22:00,056
Go and put some clothes on!

245
00:22:00,223 --> 00:22:02,681
It's only us here.

246
00:22:02,848 --> 00:22:05,140
What if your uncles saw you?

247
00:22:06,098 --> 00:22:08,723
They're out. Let me breathe!

248
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:15,098
Come here!

249
00:22:16,473 --> 00:22:18,098
I'll kill you!

250
00:22:23,348 --> 00:22:24,806
You think it's funny?

251
00:22:30,473 --> 00:22:33,431
Nick my stuff again,
I'll rip your head off!

252
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,431
Take it off!

253
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:51,390
He lost the third trial
and he wants to appeal again.

254
00:22:51,973 --> 00:22:53,056
What do you want?

255
00:22:53,223 --> 00:22:55,265
To ask you a favour, Uncle.

256
00:22:55,515 --> 00:22:56,598
Yes?

257
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,848
It's the Super League quarter finals
on Friday.

258
00:23:02,015 --> 00:23:03,348
So?

259
00:23:03,723 --> 00:23:05,473
Can I come to the match with you?

260
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,640
Do the others want to come too?

261
00:23:07,806 --> 00:23:09,556
They don't like football.

262
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,473
You can't be among all those men.

263
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,890
I asked Grandma.

264
00:23:14,223 --> 00:23:15,640
She didn't say no.

265
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:19,015
- What did she say?
- That it's up to you.

266
00:23:19,515 --> 00:23:21,140
That it's up to me?

267
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:26,806
She knows I've followed
all the matches,

268
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:29,765
that I know all the teams
and the players.

269
00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:31,681
It'll be my last season.

270
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,056
What does she say about the men
who invaded the pitch on Saturday?

271
00:23:36,223 --> 00:23:38,140
And all the fighting?

272
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:40,265
It's out of the question.

273
00:23:45,431 --> 00:23:46,806
Shame on him.

274
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,348
Shame on him!
Is that how a man behaves?

275
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:56,473
Don't get all worked up.

276
00:23:57,015 --> 00:24:00,556
Think of your blood pressure.
Drink some water.

277
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:03,473
Did you know about his wickedness?

278
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:07,681
Suzanne, answer me.

279
00:24:08,598 --> 00:24:11,098
Did you know what your son was doing?

280
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,015
No.

281
00:24:17,431 --> 00:24:19,348
Goal!

282
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,473
Following the pitch invasion
which caused the match to be suspended,

283
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,515
the Turkish Football Federation
has announced

284
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:58,598
that Trabzonspor's match on Friday
will be off-limits to men.

285
00:25:01,306 --> 00:25:03,681
Trabzonspor will be the next team

286
00:25:03,848 --> 00:25:06,140
to play to a solely female crowd.

287
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:10,431
Women only for the home match
against Galatasaray.

288
00:25:11,973 --> 00:25:15,473
Women know how to support their team

289
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,681
and make plenty of noise...

290
00:25:21,056 --> 00:25:24,056
We have to go to that match!

291
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:25,973
In your dreams!

292
00:25:27,473 --> 00:25:31,556
The most devoted supporters
are already queuing for their tickets.

293
00:25:31,723 --> 00:25:34,265
I was here at dawn.

294
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:35,931
- You waited for 4 hours?
- Yes.

295
00:25:36,098 --> 00:25:38,515
I'm grateful to the men!

296
00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:42,348
What's going on?

297
00:25:42,515 --> 00:25:43,765
Coming to the match?

298
00:25:44,015 --> 00:25:47,265
- Are you going?
- All the girls in the village are.

299
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,015
They've organised a bus to take us.

300
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,640
Where does it go from?

301
00:25:51,806 --> 00:25:54,015
In front of the café, at 4.

302
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:57,806
We'll say we're sick.

303
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,098
They'll think we're in bed.

304
00:26:00,265 --> 00:26:01,598
I'm in!

305
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:04,473
When did you start liking football?

306
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,973
I don't care about the match,
I want to get the hell out.

307
00:26:08,348 --> 00:26:11,431
We can make heads
to put under the covers.

308
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:13,390
It hasn't even got any hair!

309
00:26:13,556 --> 00:26:14,723
Quiet!

310
00:26:22,265 --> 00:26:25,390
We can't go that way
in broad daylight.

311
00:26:25,556 --> 00:26:27,098
And it's a long way down.

312
00:26:27,265 --> 00:26:30,056
You're mad! They'll skin us alive.

313
00:26:30,223 --> 00:26:33,223
At least something will happen.

314
00:27:15,223 --> 00:27:17,723
- I'm stuck!
- What do you mean, stuck?

315
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,848
- It hurts!
- Push yourself.

316
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:23,306
- I can't!
- Why can't you?

317
00:27:23,473 --> 00:27:25,473
- Get out!
- I can't!

318
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,598
Get out!

319
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:29,056
Lale's got no boobs
so she can get through.

320
00:27:29,223 --> 00:27:32,890
It's not your boobs,
it's your fat bum jammed in there!

321
00:27:33,056 --> 00:27:34,431
Be quiet!

322
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:35,598
Up here.

323
00:27:35,765 --> 00:27:37,181
Give us a hand.

324
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:39,681
- Hurry up!
- I've got you.

325
00:27:39,848 --> 00:27:41,556
Can you give me a hand?

326
00:27:41,723 --> 00:27:43,098
Go on, Ece.

327
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:49,181
- Nur won't get up with her fat bum!
- Shut up, shorty!

328
00:27:49,348 --> 00:27:50,806
Pancake chest!

329
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,181
Don't push!

330
00:27:52,348 --> 00:27:54,556
Come on, Selma, hurry up!

331
00:27:59,723 --> 00:28:01,806
Wait for us!

332
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:09,640
Stop!

333
00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:28,056
It's all your fault!

334
00:28:28,223 --> 00:28:30,765
If you hadn't been scared
of a fly...

335
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:32,973
It was a great big wasp!

336
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,390
You can't even walk properly!

337
00:28:35,556 --> 00:28:37,848
Stop it, Lale! She fell.

338
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:43,473
What are you doing
in the middle of the road?

339
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,348
We missed the bus
for the match in Trabzon.

340
00:28:46,515 --> 00:28:48,473
Help us catch it up.

341
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,848
Are you mad? No!

342
00:28:51,015 --> 00:28:52,390
- Take us!
- No way!

343
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:53,848
- Please!
- No.

344
00:28:59,348 --> 00:29:00,598
Stop!

345
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:16,265
Thank you so much.

346
00:30:42,515 --> 00:30:44,515
Erol, the cable's too short.

347
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:47,598
Are we going to miss the match
because of a cable?

348
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:03,806
What's the matter?

349
00:31:22,223 --> 00:31:23,931
What the hell?

350
00:31:28,848 --> 00:31:31,723
There's light at Durmus Emmi's.

351
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,431
We'll drink here after.

352
00:31:34,015 --> 00:31:37,681
I only found out later
what Aunt Emine did for us.

353
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,598
Quiet!

354
00:32:15,556 --> 00:32:18,931
The fallout from our escape
wasn't what we expected.

355
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,140
Stand up straight.

356
00:32:22,223 --> 00:32:24,556
Put your sleeves down.

357
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:28,056
Show your face.

358
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:31,765
That's good.

359
00:32:32,056 --> 00:32:35,265
Your hair needs fixing.

360
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:39,181
Done it?

361
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,723
Ready?

362
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,890
We're going out for lemonade.

363
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:09,890
Don't drag your feet.

364
00:33:22,056 --> 00:33:23,681
We'll sit here.

365
00:33:23,848 --> 00:33:25,973
Come here a second.

366
00:33:27,723 --> 00:33:29,098
Wait...

367
00:33:29,598 --> 00:33:31,723
Walk over to the fountain
and back again.

368
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,515
What for?

369
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:37,181
Just go and walk
while I order the lemonade.

370
00:33:48,015 --> 00:33:50,056
She wants us to drink here?

371
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,806
It's a foot fountain!

372
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:07,306
Grandma started by showing us off.

373
00:34:13,181 --> 00:34:15,640
A few days later some workers came.

374
00:34:22,098 --> 00:34:25,056
Press down hard on the rug.
Lale, do you hear me?

375
00:34:29,015 --> 00:34:32,765
Couldn't you have talked to me
about it first?

376
00:34:32,931 --> 00:34:36,015
You're not always here.
I called the workers.

377
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:38,015
They're raising the walls a bit.

378
00:34:39,515 --> 00:34:42,681
Now the house
really did look like a prison.

379
00:34:50,598 --> 00:34:52,681
Get this ball out of here!

380
00:34:52,848 --> 00:34:54,140
Play somewhere else!

381
00:35:18,598 --> 00:35:20,931
Grandma, we've got visitors.

382
00:35:21,473 --> 00:35:22,390
Visitors?

383
00:35:22,765 --> 00:35:23,806
Do your hair.

384
00:35:23,973 --> 00:35:26,015
And go get dressed.

385
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:27,598
Sonay? Selma?

386
00:35:28,681 --> 00:35:31,723
Look how you're dressed!
Put some clothes on!

387
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,098
Bare feet too!

388
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,723
Hurry, Lale,
you come and get dressed too.

389
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,056
Quick, quick, quick!

390
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:43,473
It's so hard to raise children nowadays.

391
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,723
That's true.

392
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,348
Here she is.

393
00:35:51,973 --> 00:35:54,723
God bless her, she's beautiful!

394
00:35:56,015 --> 00:35:57,265
She's one of a kind!

395
00:35:58,098 --> 00:36:01,390
Sonay, will you serve the tea?

396
00:36:01,556 --> 00:36:03,265
Grandma, I want a word.

397
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,056
Excuse me, please.

398
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:12,056
I love Ekin.

399
00:36:12,223 --> 00:36:15,723
If you try to marry me off
to anyone else, I'll scream.

400
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,223
What?

401
00:36:20,765 --> 00:36:21,806
All right!

402
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,890
All right, all right.

403
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:28,140
But if you want to see him again,
he'll have to ask for your hand.

404
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,098
Finally Selma will serve the tea.

405
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,848
A beautiful girl too.

406
00:36:40,015 --> 00:36:41,598
You like her?

407
00:36:42,015 --> 00:36:43,390
Yes, God bless her.

408
00:36:43,556 --> 00:36:45,181
She's one of a kind too.

409
00:36:45,348 --> 00:36:47,431
Go on, serve the tea.

410
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:53,098
Osman, the lady's son,
has just done his military service.

411
00:36:53,265 --> 00:36:56,681
I'd love all my granddaughters
to be married

412
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:58,890
while I'm still alive.

413
00:36:59,848 --> 00:37:02,681
What is the young man doing now?

414
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:05,640
Welcome, Osman.

415
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,015
Thank you.

416
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:10,556
Come and sit here.

417
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:16,890
Do you know each other?

418
00:37:17,723 --> 00:37:18,765
By sight.

419
00:37:20,181 --> 00:37:21,765
How are you?

420
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:23,556
Good, thanks. And you?

421
00:37:23,723 --> 00:37:25,265
Very well, thank you.

422
00:37:27,973 --> 00:37:29,640
Do you like her, Osman?

423
00:37:30,223 --> 00:37:33,265
They're still so young and shy.

424
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:35,681
But they'll grow fond of one another.

425
00:37:35,848 --> 00:37:38,598
With time, God willing.

426
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:42,223
Shall we ask the men to join us?

427
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:46,515
To settle the matter.

428
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,098
Right now?

429
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:49,765
Why not?

430
00:37:51,265 --> 00:37:54,890
The children seem to like each other.

431
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:01,015
Welcome.

432
00:38:01,181 --> 00:38:02,765
Good evening.

433
00:38:03,806 --> 00:38:06,473
Go and fetch some more chairs.

434
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:12,556
I understand the children
have taken a liking to each other.

435
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,015
The women are agreed.

436
00:38:14,181 --> 00:38:16,181
I ask, with God's blessing
and the word of the Prophet,

437
00:38:16,348 --> 00:38:18,848
for your daughter's hand
for our son.

438
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:21,473
Very well. It's agreed.

439
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,431
It's agreed.

440
00:38:25,431 --> 00:38:26,640
Osman, your ring.

441
00:38:30,348 --> 00:38:31,765
Congratulations!

442
00:38:34,098 --> 00:38:36,056
At least that was settled.

443
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,015
And while we were at it...

444
00:38:38,181 --> 00:38:41,015
We could watch some matches together.

445
00:38:42,098 --> 00:38:43,681
Who do you support?

446
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,515
The national team!

447
00:38:52,973 --> 00:38:54,098
Do you drink alcohol?

448
00:38:55,098 --> 00:38:56,181
No.

449
00:39:00,223 --> 00:39:03,015
I ask, with God's blessing

450
00:39:03,723 --> 00:39:05,223
and the word of the Prophet,

451
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,390
for the hand of your daughter

452
00:39:07,556 --> 00:39:12,140
for our son,
with your full consent.

453
00:39:12,515 --> 00:39:15,348
If God wills it,
we have nothing to say.

454
00:39:15,515 --> 00:39:17,223
Two down.

455
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,681
Lale, I have to take
your measurements too.

456
00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:51,598
- Grandma...
- Yes, my child?

457
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:53,098
Where do I put these?

458
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:57,140
In Sonay's chest.
Those are Selma's.

459
00:39:57,431 --> 00:39:59,890
We'll keep these for Ece's wedding.

460
00:40:00,056 --> 00:40:02,681
- Ece's wedding?
- Of course.

461
00:40:04,973 --> 00:40:07,098
All About Sex

462
00:40:11,348 --> 00:40:14,848
Do I really have to sleep with Osman?

463
00:40:15,015 --> 00:40:16,431
Straight away?

464
00:40:16,598 --> 00:40:20,306
Why are you so worried?
You're not a virgin?

465
00:40:20,473 --> 00:40:22,056
Of course I am!

466
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:24,056
You can tell me.

467
00:40:24,223 --> 00:40:25,556
No, honestly.

468
00:40:26,098 --> 00:40:27,015
Listen...

469
00:40:29,056 --> 00:40:33,473
Me and Ekin make love
but I'm still a virgin.

470
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,806
How?

471
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,515
We do it the back way.

472
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,598
The back way?

473
00:40:38,765 --> 00:40:43,015
So I stay a virgin
and no chance I'll get pregnant.

474
00:41:03,806 --> 00:41:10,598
If my mother had a boat,
she'd sail it to me

475
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:24,306
If my father had a horse,
he'd ride it to me

476
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,431
If my brothers and sisters
knew where I am

477
00:41:38,598 --> 00:41:40,515
They'd come looking for me...

478
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,223
They're coming!

479
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,348
Come on, girls!

480
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,431
They're here!

481
00:41:51,556 --> 00:41:52,765
Get ready.

482
00:41:52,931 --> 00:41:54,140
Where are the veils?

483
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:06,306
Sonay!

484
00:42:08,265 --> 00:42:09,890
- Where are you?
- I'm here.

485
00:42:10,056 --> 00:42:12,306
Put your veil on, they're here.

486
00:42:12,473 --> 00:42:13,890
Where's the veil?

487
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:15,890
Hurry up!

488
00:42:17,473 --> 00:42:18,431
Hanife!

489
00:42:18,598 --> 00:42:20,598
Put her veil on, quick!

490
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,348
Erol?

491
00:42:24,348 --> 00:42:26,140
Are you coming?

492
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,348
- Welcome.
- Wait a minute!

493
00:42:41,515 --> 00:42:42,723
Wait.

494
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,556
At a wedding,

495
00:42:44,723 --> 00:42:47,390
the girl's family plays hard to get.

496
00:42:47,556 --> 00:42:49,890
Sit on those chests, girls.

497
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,098
Don't give yourselves up too easily.

498
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:54,556
Now we're playing hard to get?

499
00:42:57,681 --> 00:42:58,806
My love!

500
00:44:48,348 --> 00:44:49,723
What's the matter?

501
00:44:54,098 --> 00:44:56,723
If you don't want to marry Osman,
run away.

502
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,098
How?

503
00:44:58,931 --> 00:45:00,265
Just get in a car and go.

504
00:45:01,223 --> 00:45:02,473
Where?

505
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,973
To Istanbul, like everyone.

506
00:45:05,473 --> 00:45:07,348
It's 1000 km away.

507
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,473
And I can't drive.

508
00:45:18,473 --> 00:45:19,556
Goodbye.

509
00:45:19,931 --> 00:45:22,223
Stop it, you'll make me cry.

510
00:45:28,515 --> 00:45:31,681
It was the last time
we were all together.

511
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:48,681
- Did it hurt?
- Yes.

512
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,431
- What was it like?
- Bumpy.

513
00:46:51,598 --> 00:46:55,015
Aunt Emine said it'd be hard at first,

514
00:46:55,181 --> 00:46:57,723
but that I'd get used to it.

515
00:46:57,931 --> 00:46:59,348
Did you bleed a lot?

516
00:46:59,515 --> 00:47:00,848
Not at all.

517
00:47:02,431 --> 00:47:04,098
Osman, my son, we're waiting.

518
00:47:12,765 --> 00:47:15,473
Osman, are you going
to show us the sheet?

519
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:28,848
Coming!

520
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:32,556
I swear I'm a virgin.

521
00:47:33,681 --> 00:47:36,306
- So where's the blood?
- I don't know.

522
00:47:38,931 --> 00:47:40,890
Show us the sheet.

523
00:47:41,056 --> 00:47:42,098
Just a minute!

524
00:47:42,265 --> 00:47:44,223
What do I tell them?

525
00:47:46,098 --> 00:47:47,348
Where is it?

526
00:47:59,348 --> 00:48:00,515
Good evening.

527
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,556
We just married our son
and the girl didn't bleed.

528
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,723
Your husband doesn't seem very romantic.

529
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:17,556
I don't know him that well.

530
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:26,348
You weren't a virgin, then?

531
00:48:28,348 --> 00:48:30,806
That'll stay between us.

532
00:48:40,306 --> 00:48:42,306
I slept with the entire world.

533
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:18,515
Are you sure?

534
00:49:19,473 --> 00:49:23,140
- About what?
- Sleeping with the entire world.

535
00:49:23,306 --> 00:49:26,098
I must have slept with someone
and forgotten.

536
00:49:26,265 --> 00:49:28,765
- Your hymen's right here.
- How?

537
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:31,973
It happens.
It's just the way you're made.

538
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:36,515
It'll break sometime.
With your husband, or giving birth.

539
00:49:36,681 --> 00:49:39,223
But I can see it there.

540
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,848
It wouldn't have resisted
"the entire world"!

541
00:49:42,015 --> 00:49:44,598
Why do you say things like that?

542
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,556
I don't know.

543
00:49:50,723 --> 00:49:52,681
It's late.

544
00:49:53,306 --> 00:49:54,556
I'm tired.

545
00:49:55,265 --> 00:49:58,931
When I say I'm a virgin,
no one believes me.

546
00:49:59,515 --> 00:50:01,640
Why won't you all leave me alone?

547
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:28,348
What's going on?

548
00:50:28,515 --> 00:50:30,890
They've come to ask for Ece's hand.

549
00:50:35,556 --> 00:50:38,598
Tell them,
"You want coffee? Get it yourself!"

550
00:50:38,765 --> 00:50:40,848
Then slam the door and go.

551
00:50:41,015 --> 00:50:42,265
Open this.

552
00:50:42,431 --> 00:50:45,223
Did they bring it?

553
00:50:47,723 --> 00:50:50,556
Lale, what are you doing?

554
00:50:55,931 --> 00:50:58,598
I'll slap you! Get out!

555
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:01,306
Don't walk on the biscuits!

556
00:51:02,306 --> 00:51:03,890
Put that salt down!

557
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:18,223
Be quiet!

558
00:51:22,806 --> 00:51:24,015
Don't push me.

559
00:51:26,556 --> 00:51:28,806
Ece is one of a kind.

560
00:51:28,973 --> 00:51:31,098
She's so helpful.

561
00:51:31,265 --> 00:51:32,348
Thank you.

562
00:51:32,515 --> 00:51:33,765
Elegant...

563
00:51:33,931 --> 00:51:37,181
When it was Ece's turn,
at first she went along with it.

564
00:51:39,556 --> 00:51:42,848
Then she started behaving dangerously.

565
00:53:02,515 --> 00:53:04,765
Another match?
Where are you going?

566
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,015
I'm leaving.

567
00:53:06,181 --> 00:53:07,223
Going where?

568
00:53:08,848 --> 00:53:10,181
Istanbul.

569
00:53:10,348 --> 00:53:11,681
On foot?

570
00:53:12,723 --> 00:53:15,140
Get in, I'll take you home.

571
00:53:15,306 --> 00:53:16,431
No way.

572
00:53:16,598 --> 00:53:17,640
You're right.

573
00:53:17,806 --> 00:53:21,765
It'll only take you
about nine or ten days.

574
00:53:23,223 --> 00:53:24,931
And you're in luck.

575
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:28,765
Muddy slippers
are all the rage in Istanbul.

576
00:53:37,306 --> 00:53:38,515
Open up!

577
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:47,348
Maybe it was the fresh air, but it felt
like returning to the nut-house.

578
00:53:48,098 --> 00:53:50,765
I used to kiss
the soles of my mum's feet.

579
00:53:50,931 --> 00:53:52,598
She made a fuss about it.

580
00:53:52,765 --> 00:53:54,890
I said,
"Mum, don't pull your feet away.

581
00:53:55,056 --> 00:53:57,598
"That's the fragrance of paradise."

582
00:53:57,765 --> 00:54:01,181
Sometimes she cried.
That's how mothers are.

583
00:54:02,265 --> 00:54:03,640
Coming for a swim?

584
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,140
Easy! You'll end up
a fat cow at your wedding!

585
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:11,098
Some will understand, others won't.

586
00:54:11,265 --> 00:54:15,931
Feminists won't.
They refuse motherhood.

587
00:54:16,098 --> 00:54:17,265
One,

588
00:54:17,431 --> 00:54:18,973
two, three!

589
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:22,931
I'm going to dive under the water.

590
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,015
Don't spit at me!

591
00:54:36,265 --> 00:54:38,098
I'm down really deep.

592
00:54:39,431 --> 00:54:41,098
Lale, where are you?

593
00:54:43,765 --> 00:54:45,473
I'm coming to find you.

594
00:54:53,015 --> 00:54:55,806
Look, I found a seashell.

595
00:54:57,598 --> 00:54:58,681
Listen.

596
00:55:00,348 --> 00:55:03,890
Not in front of my door!
You've put bars everywhere.

597
00:55:05,723 --> 00:55:07,890
Aren't you coming back to school?

598
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:57,306
I'm going to the bank. Stay here.

599
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:14,556
What's that?

600
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:25,556
- Shall I beat those boys up?
- No.

601
00:57:25,723 --> 00:57:28,223
Hang them up by their feet?

602
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:29,640
No, don't bother.

603
00:57:31,556 --> 00:57:32,848
Where are you going?

604
00:57:33,015 --> 00:57:34,140
Across the street.

605
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,598
Güven Travel
Istanbul, Ankara, Samsun

606
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,848
Warn me when Erol comes back.

607
00:58:43,223 --> 00:58:45,681
Why are you out of the car?

608
00:58:45,848 --> 00:58:49,140
Now we're here,
can we have an ice-cream?

609
00:58:49,306 --> 00:58:51,515
We don't have time.

610
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,765
Later.

611
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:23,598
I leave you two minutes
and everybody's out.

612
00:59:23,765 --> 00:59:26,306
And why did you close the windows?

613
00:59:40,556 --> 00:59:41,640
Ece?

614
00:59:46,265 --> 00:59:47,056
I want you!

615
00:59:51,765 --> 00:59:53,681
Is that you, Ece?

616
00:59:57,765 --> 00:59:59,890
It's the guy who got in the car.

617
01:00:00,056 --> 01:00:03,140
I've been talking to my mates
about you all night.

618
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:08,140
Come into my arms, Ece!

619
01:00:10,431 --> 01:00:11,848
I want you!

620
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:13,473
Idiot!

621
01:00:17,806 --> 01:00:18,973
Did he follow us?

622
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,181
How does he know where we live?

623
01:00:21,723 --> 01:00:22,765
I told him.

624
01:00:22,931 --> 01:00:25,556
Erol, do you hear that?

625
01:00:26,265 --> 01:00:28,348
There are people in the garden.

626
01:00:28,515 --> 01:00:30,098
Go and see.

627
01:00:32,598 --> 01:00:33,598
Are you mad?

628
01:00:34,348 --> 01:00:35,848
Get the hell out of here!

629
01:00:52,306 --> 01:00:53,348
Girls?

630
01:01:29,181 --> 01:01:30,140
Stop!

631
01:01:37,723 --> 01:01:40,306
Teach me how to drive a car.

632
01:01:40,556 --> 01:01:42,098
I've tried loads of times.

633
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:45,515
I press down, the engine revs
but it doesn't move.

634
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:47,931
Show me how to do it.

635
01:01:48,431 --> 01:01:52,306
I could get in big trouble
hanging about with you.

636
01:01:52,473 --> 01:01:53,140
And me?

637
01:01:53,431 --> 01:01:55,973
You think I should be here with you?

638
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:58,140
Turn the wheel...

639
01:01:58,806 --> 01:01:59,848
Nice and gently.

640
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:04,640
Come off the brake.

641
01:02:05,515 --> 01:02:06,473
Well done.

642
01:02:09,473 --> 01:02:11,681
Don't let the clutch out suddenly.

643
01:02:14,265 --> 01:02:15,390
Do it gradually.

644
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,890
Accelerate a bit.

645
01:02:21,056 --> 01:02:22,390
Not all at once!

646
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,640
That's it.

647
01:02:26,181 --> 01:02:27,181
What's this?

648
01:02:27,348 --> 01:02:28,473
The horn.

649
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:33,140
Watch it!

650
01:02:33,306 --> 01:02:35,640
Accelerate. More!

651
01:02:51,015 --> 01:02:52,098
Very nice.

652
01:02:52,515 --> 01:02:55,515
Huge progress with your shoes, at least.

653
01:03:27,223 --> 01:03:30,473
Women must be chaste and pure,

654
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,223
know their limits,

655
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:35,681
and mustn't laugh openly in public,

656
01:03:35,848 --> 01:03:39,181
or be provocative with every move.

657
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:42,056
Women must guard their chastity!

658
01:03:42,765 --> 01:03:47,931
Where are the girls who blush
when you look at them?

659
01:03:55,056 --> 01:03:56,223
What's this?

660
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:58,848
A bunch of these!

661
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,431
Can you read between the lines?

662
01:04:29,431 --> 01:04:30,848
What's going on?

663
01:04:58,765 --> 01:05:00,015
Leave the table.

664
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,806
Go away!

665
01:05:03,806 --> 01:05:04,848
All right.

666
01:05:19,848 --> 01:05:21,348
Finish your meal.

667
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,890
Seref, get the girls away from here!

668
01:07:06,015 --> 01:07:07,515
Darling, we're going.

669
01:07:08,931 --> 01:07:11,015
Selma, your husband's waiting too.

670
01:07:36,306 --> 01:07:37,515
Lale...

671
01:08:02,348 --> 01:08:03,473
Thank you.

672
01:08:27,515 --> 01:08:29,598
Don't you want to leave?

673
01:08:29,806 --> 01:08:31,015
Where to?

674
01:08:34,015 --> 01:08:36,015
We could go to Istanbul.

675
01:08:36,723 --> 01:08:37,973
Istanbul...

676
01:09:10,681 --> 01:09:12,515
I want to get out of here.

677
01:09:14,306 --> 01:09:16,390
If we get caught, they'll murder us.

678
01:09:16,556 --> 01:09:17,765
We'll do it right.

679
01:09:17,931 --> 01:09:21,390
No one will know we're gone
until we're far away.

680
01:10:05,681 --> 01:10:07,890
What have you done to your hair?

681
01:10:17,723 --> 01:10:18,848
It's hot.

682
01:10:34,473 --> 01:10:37,181
Get up and take the girls out.

683
01:10:37,348 --> 01:10:38,306
They're hot.

684
01:12:20,265 --> 01:12:21,681
What were you doing?

685
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:25,223
I asked you a question!

686
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:30,890
Stop that! Stop it right now!

687
01:12:36,723 --> 01:12:37,848
Not sleeping?

688
01:12:38,306 --> 01:12:39,598
I was thirsty.

689
01:12:45,181 --> 01:12:46,306
Not sleeping?

690
01:12:47,181 --> 01:12:48,223
Yes, I am.

691
01:13:01,765 --> 01:13:05,390
It's nice to see you
working hard like this.

692
01:13:05,556 --> 01:13:07,223
You do it really well.

693
01:13:07,681 --> 01:13:09,431
You're a woman now.

694
01:13:11,056 --> 01:13:13,348
It'll soon be time for you to marry.

695
01:13:13,515 --> 01:13:16,556
- What?
- You're a young woman now.

696
01:13:16,723 --> 01:13:18,515
I got married when I was your age.

697
01:13:18,681 --> 01:13:21,098
There were special circumstances too.

698
01:13:21,265 --> 01:13:22,181
Married?

699
01:13:22,348 --> 01:13:23,431
Me?

700
01:13:23,598 --> 01:13:26,390
- Yes, you.
- Marry who?

701
01:13:27,223 --> 01:13:31,265
There'll be plenty of suitors
once you're ready.

702
01:13:31,431 --> 01:13:34,056
I didn't know my husband at all.

703
01:13:34,223 --> 01:13:35,890
But I grew to love him.

704
01:13:36,723 --> 01:13:38,265
It'll be the same for you.

705
01:13:38,431 --> 01:13:40,265
You'll fall in love.

706
01:13:40,598 --> 01:13:42,931
You fall in love easily at your age.

707
01:13:43,098 --> 01:13:44,306
You're joking, right?

708
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:46,098
No.

709
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:52,973
Your son has a very good job.

710
01:13:53,473 --> 01:13:55,640
Nur, sit next to Bülent.

711
01:13:59,056 --> 01:14:03,556
Bülent will be in the army
for a year and a half.

712
01:14:04,098 --> 01:14:07,140
When you're married,
you'll live with his parents.

713
01:14:07,306 --> 01:14:10,140
They'll be
like a mother and father to you.

714
01:15:28,098 --> 01:15:29,556
She won't need that.

715
01:15:31,848 --> 01:15:34,515
She can use this one.

716
01:15:35,806 --> 01:15:36,848
All ready.

717
01:17:14,556 --> 01:17:15,640
Welcome.

718
01:17:18,265 --> 01:17:19,390
Welcome.

719
01:17:35,515 --> 01:17:37,848
What are you doing?
Open the door!

720
01:17:38,015 --> 01:17:39,848
We're playing hard to get!

721
01:17:41,015 --> 01:17:41,973
Girls!

722
01:17:43,181 --> 01:17:45,848
- What are you doing?
- You want to marry him?

723
01:17:46,015 --> 01:17:46,806
No.

724
01:17:46,973 --> 01:17:49,265
Then help me move this.

725
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:51,140
Open the door!

726
01:17:57,473 --> 01:17:59,765
Maybe they have a surprise for us.

727
01:18:01,848 --> 01:18:04,598
They should have followed us out.

728
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,515
Where are you?

729
01:18:08,098 --> 01:18:09,890
Everything's fine, don't worry.

730
01:18:10,056 --> 01:18:13,681
Let's make ourselves comfortable.
They'll join us later.

731
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:17,181
It's all the excitement.
It happens sometimes.

732
01:18:18,015 --> 01:18:20,723
They'll be out soon, don't worry.

733
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:24,431
She's been so looking forward to it.

734
01:18:45,306 --> 01:18:47,306
I'm not marrying that guy!

735
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:48,515
What did you say?

736
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:50,973
You didn't have to say it like that!

737
01:18:56,348 --> 01:18:57,598
Keep calm.

738
01:18:57,765 --> 01:18:58,765
Come here.

739
01:18:59,973 --> 01:19:01,015
Closer.

740
01:19:01,973 --> 01:19:03,556
Let's have some music.

741
01:19:03,723 --> 01:19:05,056
Do what I tell you.

742
01:19:05,473 --> 01:19:07,681
Open the door now.

743
01:19:09,431 --> 01:19:11,306
Pull yourself together.

744
01:19:11,473 --> 01:19:12,931
All right, Mum.

745
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:15,473
Let's go and sit over there.

746
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:18,015
Let's sit down.

747
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:29,223
Open the door!

748
01:19:33,681 --> 01:19:34,640
Come here!

749
01:19:35,223 --> 01:19:36,223
Open the door!

750
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:37,390
Open it!

751
01:20:01,598 --> 01:20:03,223
He's looking for a way in.

752
01:20:24,848 --> 01:20:26,556
Nur, be reasonable.

753
01:20:26,723 --> 01:20:27,931
Take this.

754
01:20:30,265 --> 01:20:31,681
Leave me alone.

755
01:20:32,306 --> 01:20:33,598
Come down.

756
01:20:34,306 --> 01:20:37,265
I know it's a special day for you.

757
01:20:37,431 --> 01:20:41,098
No way am I doing stuff like that
with that guy!

758
01:20:41,681 --> 01:20:45,015
I've never been so humiliated.
The wedding's off!

759
01:20:45,181 --> 01:20:46,140
Now we agree!

760
01:20:46,306 --> 01:20:47,890
Be reasonable, Nur.

761
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,015
There's your dowry!

762
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,431
I have loads of salesmen.

763
01:20:59,598 --> 01:21:01,890
His name's Yasin, he has long hair.

764
01:21:02,056 --> 01:21:04,681
I don't have any queer salesmen.

765
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:10,348
Nur, I can see you!

766
01:21:10,681 --> 01:21:14,306
I'll call the police, you bastard,
and tell them everything!

767
01:21:15,181 --> 01:21:16,181
Yasin?

768
01:21:16,348 --> 01:21:17,056
Yes?

769
01:21:17,223 --> 01:21:19,806
It's Lale.
You have to come and help me.

770
01:21:19,973 --> 01:21:22,973
We're locked in the house.
They want to kill us.

771
01:21:24,431 --> 01:21:25,431
Yasin?

772
01:21:28,348 --> 01:21:29,973
I'll kill you!

773
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,223
Shit!

774
01:21:32,848 --> 01:21:34,640
They've cut the phone line.

775
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:36,806
Do they have their guns?

776
01:21:51,931 --> 01:21:54,348
I've got Uncle Erol's car keys.

777
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:29,681
Show yourselves!

778
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:39,473
Where are you?

779
01:23:48,515 --> 01:23:50,015
I'll get you!

780
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:40,223
- Leave them.
- Let me go!

781
01:24:40,723 --> 01:24:42,890
They're getting away!

782
01:24:43,056 --> 01:24:44,723
Leave it to me!

783
01:24:45,765 --> 01:24:47,098
Erol, don't go.

784
01:24:48,723 --> 01:24:50,140
Stay there!

785
01:24:57,931 --> 01:24:58,931
Hurry up!

786
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:06,140
Quick!

787
01:25:59,598 --> 01:26:01,848
If he heard me, he'll come.

788
01:26:07,223 --> 01:26:08,473
Hide!

789
01:26:37,931 --> 01:26:39,473
He's not going to come.

790
01:26:40,806 --> 01:26:41,931
Wait!

791
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,890
Stop him! That's him!

792
01:26:55,306 --> 01:26:57,473
Stop, Yasin!

793
01:30:48,223 --> 01:30:49,473
Big sister.

794
01:30:50,515 --> 01:30:52,306
Do you know this address?

795
01:31:38,973 --> 01:31:39,931
Hello?

796
01:31:40,306 --> 01:31:43,181
I'm looking for my teacher, Miss Dilek.

797
01:31:45,223 --> 01:31:46,348
Dilek!

798
01:31:55,306 --> 01:31:56,265
Lale?

799
01:32:04,431 --> 01:32:05,515
Sweetheart.
