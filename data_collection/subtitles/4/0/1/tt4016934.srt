1
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:22,081
You little brats, beat it!

2
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:26,801
Hey...

3
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:03,521
It should have been me!

4
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:07,201
I should be the one going
to that Jap's house.

5
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:12,841
You'll miss the train.

6
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,321
Hurry.

7
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:27,241
'PART ONE'

8
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:48,161
'Kouzuki Noriaki'

9
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:57,441
Go back to sleep.

10
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:59,961
We're still far from the house.

11
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:31,761
Pleased to meet you. I am Okju.

12
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:33,481
This property has three buildings.

13
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:35,721
A Western-style wing by
an English architect

14
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:38,561
and a Japanese wing form the main house.

15
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:42,401
Not even in Japan is there
a building combining two styles.

16
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:48,801
It reflects Master's admiration
for Japan and England.

17
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:51,721
Next is the annex

18
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:54,361
which Master had furnished as a library.

19
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:56,121
Last, the servants' quarters.

20
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:59,041
As the Lady's handmaiden
you won't sleep there.

21
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:01,281
You may eat her leftover food,

22
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:03,761
but tea leaves go to the kitchen girls.

23
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:06,161
Used soap is for the steward.

24
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:08,761
Anyone caught pilfering
is expelled that day.

25
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,521
I'm sure you wouldn't dare, Tamako.

26
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:17,201
"Tamako" is you. Your
name Okju in Japanese.

27
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:20,801
- Call me Sasaki.
- Yes, ma'am.

28
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:30,521
The Lady's routine is simple. Taking
a walk, or reading for Master.

29
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:35,321
Among the richest men,
Master is the greatest book lover.

30
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:38,121
And among book lovers, he is the richest.

31
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:41,321
His ties to the colonial government
even let us use electricity.

32
00:04:41,401 --> 00:04:43,241
In such a home,

33
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:47,761
you know what's expected
of a maid like you?

34
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:53,081
Don't be alarmed at the blackouts.

35
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:18,481
I sleep in here?

36
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:22,841
Miss Hideko wakes easily
on account of her nerves.

37
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:25,401
She's behind this door?

38
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:00,521
Mother!

39
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:06,961
Mother!

40
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:08,841
Mother!

41
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:11,801
Miss!

42
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:14,001
Miss, are you alright?

43
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:16,401
Junko! Is that you?

44
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:20,161
Junko was kicked out, Miss.
I'm the new girl.

45
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:22,761
Seems you had a bad dream.

46
00:06:23,401 --> 00:06:26,441
You see that big cherry tree?

47
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:30,681
My aunt went mad and
hanged herself there.

48
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:33,681
Sometimes on moonless nights,

49
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,401
my aunt's ghost

50
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:39,121
dangles from that branch.

51
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,241
Here, drink up.

52
00:06:56,361 --> 00:07:01,481
When babies cry, my auntie feeds them
a spoonful of sake.

53
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:09,521
"Sweet bird, sweet bird

54
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:13,961
"My sweet bluebird

55
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:23,081
"What scent is this, that fills my nose?"

56
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:29,081
You think I'm Tamako, a
poor Korean handmaiden.

57
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:32,201
But my real name's Nam Sookee.

58
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:38,401
Raised by Miss Boksun,
top purveyor of stolen goods.

59
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:42,561
I was able at age 5 to tell
a real coin from a fake.

60
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:45,681
Then learned to forge stamps from Gugai,

61
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:49,481
and studied pickpocketing from Kutan,

62
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,401
but these babies will never learn
such useful skills.

63
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:56,201
Abandoned as newborns,

64
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:59,521
we'll wash and feed them,
then sell them to Japan.

65
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:01,401
Such meaningful work.

66
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:06,041
Instead of starving, they grow up
gentlemen and ladies.

67
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:11,401
Kutan only breastfeeds her own kid.
I wouldn't be so miserly.

68
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:16,441
I wish my breasts gave milk.
I'd breastfeed all of them.

69
00:08:55,721 --> 00:08:58,841
I'll tell you the story of an interpreter,

70
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:04,601
who bribed his way into translating
for high officials.

71
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:09,481
After helping Japan annex Korea,
he got rights to a gold mine.

72
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,601
Now he wants to turn fully Japanese.

73
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:16,241
So he gets naturalized,

74
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:20,081
marries the daughter of
a fallen Japanese noble,

75
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:23,921
and adopts his wife's family name Kouzuki.

76
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:28,521
Ba... Bas...

77
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:33,721
Bastard builds a mansion,
fills it with books and antiques.

78
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:39,041
He invites Japanese
collectors to his library,

79
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:43,161
holds readings of rare books,
and auctions the books off.

80
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:46,081
He loves books and paintings
like his own flesh,

81
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:47,881
but he can't help parting with a few.

82
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,441
What to do, when he must sell,
but can't bear to?

83
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:53,481
He sells a fake.

84
00:09:56,001 --> 00:10:00,881
He seeks out a specialist
to create intricate forgeries.

85
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:06,441
Unlike him this specialist...
is a real Japanese, of noble birth!

86
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:10,681
Count Fujiwara from Nagoya.

87
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:15,321
So, who is this?

88
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:19,481
It's the wife. His Japanese wife.

89
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:23,121
- You'll seduce her...
- Is she pretty?

90
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:26,161
The Jap wife died ages
ago with no children.

91
00:10:26,481 --> 00:10:30,801
But the dead wife's dead sister's
living daughter

92
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,321
performs those book readings.

93
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:33,841
But is she pretty?

94
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:36,401
An orphan. Her father was rich.

95
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:40,481
Soon she'll fall in love with me,
and we'll elope to Japan.

96
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:44,881
After marrying her there,
and inheriting her fortune,

97
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:46,881
I'll declare her insane

98
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:48,841
and lock her up in a madhouse.

99
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:50,321
Right!

100
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:58,401
Sookee will be my mouse,
work as her maid, eavesdrop on her,

101
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:03,681
stay by her side and gently persuade her
to fall in love.

102
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:05,281
Love?

103
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:07,961
What does a crook know about love?

104
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:16,441
What of her fortune? She's rich?

105
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,441
Each night in bed I think of her assets.

106
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:23,681
1.5 million in cash. 300,000 in bonds.

107
00:11:26,841 --> 00:11:29,961
The uncle is just a guardian.
It's Hideko's fortune.

108
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:33,481
That's why Kouzuki schemes
to marry the girl.

109
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:36,401
To his w... wife's niece?

110
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,681
What a s... sick f... f...

111
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:40,641
Right, a sick fuck.

112
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,641
So what's our share?

113
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:46,401
I'll share 50,000

114
00:11:46,521 --> 00:11:48,921
Sookee gets the dresses and jewellery.

115
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:51,201
I'll do it! Take me!

116
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:54,641
My Japanese is better,
and I worked as a maid!

117
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:09,361
On top of the fifty,

118
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:14,881
I get dresses, jewellery
and my own 100,000.

119
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,441
She must be crazy...

120
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:20,001
Crazy? Not a bit.

121
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:23,201
I'll take my fortune and flee this country.

122
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:28,801
Endure these country yokels a bit longer.

123
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:46,361
Those fuckers.

124
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,921
This is Tamako.

125
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:52,881
I am at your service. Miss...

126
00:12:54,961 --> 00:12:56,201
Bloody hell.

127
00:12:58,081 --> 00:13:01,201
He should've told me she was so pretty.

128
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:03,321
I'm completely flummoxed.

129
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:05,721
A reference letter

130
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:08,601
from Lady Minami, my last mistress.

131
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:13,241
Here's the letter. Pay attention.

132
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:17,721
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

133
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:22,521
"Count Fujiwara has informed me of
your urgent need for a maid.

134
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:26,121
"A maid is like a pair of chopsticks.

135
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:30,521
"Her presence is little noted,
but her absence causes much distress."

136
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:34,641
So is this place to your liking?

137
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:38,441
The sun scarcely ever shines here.

138
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:40,681
Uncle won't permit it.

139
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:43,561
Sunlight causes books to fade.

140
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:46,561
One could never grow fond of
such a dreary place.

141
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:53,641
Not a good liar, are you?

142
00:13:54,561 --> 00:13:56,521
I'll take my leave.

143
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:13,161
My head aches before
every reading practice.

144
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:17,761
Would you read it to me?

145
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:19,401
Pardon?

146
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:30,001
Oh, how kind of her.

147
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:33,721
Lady Minami said
such nice things about me!

148
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:35,081
Is that so?

149
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:42,761
You're a Japanese lady,
why don't you speak Japanese?

150
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:44,321
I'm sick of it.

151
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:47,201
The books he makes me
read are all Japanese.

152
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:50,561
So read that for me.

153
00:15:01,721 --> 00:15:04,121
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

154
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:08,801
"Count Fujiwara said
you're looking for a maid.

155
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,081
"Maids are like...

156
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:13,681
a spoon... no...

157
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,521
"are like chopsticks..."

158
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:22,841
Is it a spoon?

159
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:33,961
I don't know to read, Miss.

160
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:38,921
Not at all? What about Korean?

161
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:05,361
This is your name. Can't you read it?

162
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:13,521
Reading can be learned,

163
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:16,841
and I don't care if you curse or steal.

164
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:21,801
But don't ever lie to me. Understood?

165
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:23,561
Yes, Miss.

166
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,441
My mum.

167
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:34,361
She's beautiful, quite the charmer!

168
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:37,521
And me? Am I "quite the charmer?"

169
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:42,721
Everyone says I can't compare to my mother.

170
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:48,761
Count Fujiwara said...

171
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:51,241
So you've met the Count?

172
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:52,481
Pardon?

173
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:54,641
No, I never met him...

174
00:16:55,121 --> 00:16:57,841
My aunt! I heard it from my aunt.

175
00:16:57,921 --> 00:17:00,161
She was his nanny.

176
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:03,001
What did the Count say about me?

177
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:06,481
He said your face...

178
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:11,281
Every night in bed he thinks
of your assets... your face.

179
00:17:14,641 --> 00:17:16,801
Why in bed, I wonder?

180
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:22,281
What's with your foot?

181
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:29,921
I've nowhere to go.

182
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:33,881
I've just stayed in this house
since coming to Korea at age 5.

183
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,761
But in new shoes, even well-trodden paths
feel fresh.

184
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:42,201
The ones from here

185
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:45,081
up to here should fit you.

186
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:53,041
Time for reading practice.

187
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:54,801
I'll go alone.

188
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:55,841
Miss?

189
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:57,681
But rain is falling.

190
00:18:12,681 --> 00:18:17,041
At noon, come knock on the door. Promise?

191
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:21,721
See you at...

192
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,241
See you later.

193
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:32,841
What's this?

194
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:15,001
Why would the lady of such a big house...

195
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:25,441
Did the big house make her go mad?

196
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,761
My new handmaiden.

197
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,481
The snake, the snake!

198
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,681
You mustn't pass that point.

199
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:16,961
Be warned!

200
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:20,321
The snake marks the
'bounds of knowledge'.

201
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:29,321
A snake!

202
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:35,081
The Count?

203
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:37,001
Today?

204
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:42,641
That's why you insisted on a bath.

205
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:45,361
My aunt, when she heard a guest was coming,

206
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:48,161
dropped everything and
bathed her Baby Miss.

207
00:20:48,721 --> 00:20:53,281
Nothing made her happier than when guests
praised her baby's scent.

208
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:57,161
You are my Baby Miss.

209
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:01,361
Auntie gave the babies candy during baths.

210
00:21:01,441 --> 00:21:03,881
To teach them that bath time is sweet.

211
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:05,641
What's Wrong?

212
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:10,361
One of my teeth is sharp.
It keeps cutting me.

213
00:21:54,321 --> 00:21:56,161
So this was the scent.

214
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:53,881
All smooth.

215
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:10,081
Welcome, sir!

216
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:22,841
You are too kind to greet me
this way upon my arrival,

217
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,121
when the journey
has left me so unkempt.

218
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:27,881
Now your tedium is over.

219
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:32,161
I'll ensure your
painting lessons are stimulating.

220
00:23:35,121 --> 00:23:36,401
This must be Okju.

221
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,961
At your service, milord.

222
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:43,521
You know if you fail, it'll put me in
an awkward position?

223
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:48,961
A decent bone
structure for a Korean...

224
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:53,521
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

225
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:09,321
Count Fujiwara requests Miss Hideko
to kindly allow her maid Tamako

226
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:13,121
to be sent to his Lordship
for a brief errand.

227
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:23,321
Did you call for me, milord?

228
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:24,881
You may enter.

229
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:57,041
Everyone's talking about you in Eunpo.

230
00:24:57,281 --> 00:25:00,241
How you'll be an even greater thief
than your mum.

231
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:02,841
Who believes the talk of a swindler?

232
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:07,481
When I give the signal, "fully ripe",

233
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:09,481
arrange for her and I to be alone.

234
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:11,601
Then I'll gobble her up to the pit.

235
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:14,961
She's so naive, even if a man
pulls on her nipples

236
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:17,641
she won't know what he wants.

237
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,081
So it's your job to tell her

238
00:25:20,161 --> 00:25:23,281
that everything is because of me.

239
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:26,361
"Oh my, since the Count arrived,"

240
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,201
"your toenails are
growing much faster!"

241
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:31,361
That sort of thing, all right?

242
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:33,961
Here, a gift.

243
00:25:45,281 --> 00:25:47,761
Oh, he's so thoughtful!

244
00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:52,081
That'll be mine when she
goes to the madhouse.

245
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:56,041
It pains my heart to see this poor girl.

246
00:25:56,161 --> 00:25:58,801
Have you ever seen sapphires so blue?

247
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:03,801
Let's take a look...

248
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:09,361
This isn't a sapphire, it's blue spinel.

249
00:26:12,121 --> 00:26:14,961
It's all right, Miss.
Spinels are expensive too.

250
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:17,241
How do you know...

251
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:22,161
Oh, my Auntie... I mean,
Lady Minami taught me.

252
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,321
But it's fine!

253
00:26:24,441 --> 00:26:25,921
No need to be ashamed at all.

254
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,521
Your average fence can
barely tell them apart.

255
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:29,921
Is that so?

256
00:26:43,521 --> 00:26:46,361
Of all the things I've washed and dressed,

257
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,321
has anything been this pretty?

258
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:53,801
I'd like to show her to the people at home.

259
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:56,601
What would they say?

260
00:26:58,521 --> 00:27:00,241
Probably this?

261
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,201
Mesmerising!

262
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:07,841
S... Spellbindingly beautiful!

263
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:15,801
He's shameless.

264
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:21,241
B... b... beautiful!

265
00:27:21,401 --> 00:27:24,361
I... I... I'm flummoxed in your presence!

266
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:28,801
If you stutter like that
and make your face go red,

267
00:27:29,201 --> 00:27:31,321
those uppity bitches will feel superior,

268
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:34,481
and then they'll open up to you, all right?

269
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:36,761
You try it.

270
00:27:39,801 --> 00:27:42,481
One, two, three!

271
00:27:44,681 --> 00:27:48,601
The Count kept pushing wine on me.

272
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:56,881
Does it feel okay?

273
00:27:57,281 --> 00:28:00,321
It's suffocating. How do ladies
wear such things?

274
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:02,921
You think this is suffocating?

275
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:06,281
Miss, you're killing me!

276
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:12,561
Dressed up, you look like a lady, too.

277
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:18,641
I think I know

278
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:22,041
what the Count meant.

279
00:28:23,561 --> 00:28:25,161
Your face...

280
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:28,321
Each night in bed,

281
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:31,161
I think of your face.

282
00:28:34,601 --> 00:28:36,641
Don't be silly, Miss.

283
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:46,521
Ladies truly are the dolls of maids.

284
00:28:47,321 --> 00:28:51,281
All these buttons are for my amusement.

285
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:55,161
If I undo the buttons
and pull out the cords,

286
00:28:56,321 --> 00:28:59,601
then, the sweet things within,

287
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:02,921
those sweet and soft things...

288
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:09,241
If I were still a pickpocket
I'd slip my hand inside...

289
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:44,841
Miss, are you truly going
to marry your uncle?

290
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:52,041
That's what he raised me for,
knowing he'd need my fortune.

291
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:55,081
There's a famous collector in France.

292
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:58,201
He'll be putting his entire library
up for auction.

293
00:29:58,441 --> 00:30:01,441
The gold mine's proceeds
won't cover the cost.

294
00:30:02,361 --> 00:30:07,321
If it were me, I'd sell books
to buy gold, not the opposite.

295
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:41,761
For now,

296
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:43,921
the Lady needn't go read to the sick fuck

297
00:30:43,961 --> 00:30:46,321
who wants to marry his wife's niece.

298
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:52,441
Instead the fake Count goes to the Library
to make fake books.

299
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:59,521
The Lady waits for her 2 o'clock art class,

300
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:01,441
and waits...

301
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:05,361
Poor girl,

302
00:31:05,481 --> 00:31:07,841
losing her heart to a fake.

303
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:42,521
Please, Count!

304
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:34,401
Sorry to be late.

305
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:36,161
It's no matter.

306
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:48,081
Maybe I need more practice
to give it dimensionality?

307
00:32:48,161 --> 00:32:50,561
Dimensionality... perhaps.

308
00:32:50,641 --> 00:32:54,121
Nonetheless, you have a vision
that transcends mere skill.

309
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:57,801
As if you see directly into
an object's essence.

310
00:32:58,481 --> 00:33:02,641
For example, the fact that
this peach contains a lot of water.

311
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:05,801
I hesitate to stand before you,

312
00:33:05,881 --> 00:33:08,361
for fear that you
might read my thoughts.

313
00:33:16,321 --> 00:33:17,841
That's enough for today.

314
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:25,681
Almost fully ripe.

315
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:28,361
Already?

316
00:33:32,281 --> 00:33:33,601
Damn...

317
00:33:37,321 --> 00:33:38,441
Do you know what?

318
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:42,001
Since the Count arrived,
your cheeks have grown flushed.

319
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,321
Have they?

320
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:51,601
How did your mum die?

321
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:57,681
When I was a baby,
at a big house, she was hanged...

322
00:33:57,881 --> 00:34:01,601
- I mean, she hanged...
- Hanged herself? Like my aunt.

323
00:34:02,401 --> 00:34:04,121
Well, pretty much.

324
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:15,761
Still, while alive she hugged you a lot?

325
00:34:19,921 --> 00:34:23,721
My mother died giving birth to me.

326
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:31,361
So it's as if I strangled her myself.

327
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:35,961
I wish I'd never been born.

328
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:42,481
No baby is ever guilty of being born.

329
00:34:43,241 --> 00:34:45,401
If your mother thought you could understand

330
00:34:45,481 --> 00:34:47,641
this is what she'd have said.

331
00:34:48,801 --> 00:34:52,361
That she was so lucky to
have you before dying.

332
00:34:52,921 --> 00:34:55,001
That she had no regrets.

333
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:03,961
Did my mum cry before they hanged her?

334
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:07,881
Your mother stole a thousand times,

335
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:12,121
was caught just once, and died once.

336
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:14,961
Did she cry?

337
00:35:18,961 --> 00:35:20,721
She laughed.

338
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:24,121
Said she was lucky to
have you before dying.

339
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:26,321
That she had no regrets.

340
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:35,121
Wait here a moment, Miss.

341
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:37,761
I'll go pick mushrooms.

342
00:35:39,321 --> 00:35:42,201
We'll have mushroom stew tonight,
you like that.

343
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:44,321
I'll go with you.

344
00:35:44,681 --> 00:35:46,401
I'll be quick.

345
00:35:47,001 --> 00:35:48,841
Before it rains.

346
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,401
Good girl...

347
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:05,161
What a coincidence.

348
00:36:05,361 --> 00:36:06,321
Indeed.

349
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:08,921
May I sit by you?

350
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:37,001
The lady sits, shy and trembling.

351
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:39,761
The gentleman is persistent.

352
00:36:40,561 --> 00:36:44,321
The perceptive maid has
stepped out for a moment.

353
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:47,881
All is well, Sookee.

354
00:36:48,321 --> 00:36:51,441
Everyone's performing their roles
so damned well.

355
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,201
Fucking hell.

356
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,801
You know servants can't use this entrance!

357
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:09,281
Hey!

358
00:37:14,361 --> 00:37:17,401
I wish I'd never come here.

359
00:37:19,641 --> 00:37:21,921
It was wrong to come.

360
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,001
Tamako, you brought
watercolours, right?

361
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:28,601
Of course, milord!

362
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:30,161
Watercolour paints and brushes...

363
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:32,121
Go and get the oils.

364
00:37:32,241 --> 00:37:35,641
A day like this demands oils, yes!

365
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:21,401
A blackout! Bring a lantern.

366
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:22,481
Yes, ma'am.

367
00:38:22,521 --> 00:38:23,721
Hurry!

368
00:38:28,521 --> 00:38:31,041
I need to think.

369
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:33,721
I need to become rich,

370
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:38,161
sail off to a distant harbour,
eat food I scarcely recognize,

371
00:38:38,281 --> 00:38:41,041
buy my fill of glittering baubles, and...

372
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,761
not think of Hideko.

373
00:38:44,481 --> 00:38:46,521
Never think of Hideko...

374
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:15,441
I returned and you didn't even come to me?

375
00:39:16,281 --> 00:39:19,001
It was late, I must have slept.
My apologies.

376
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:23,161
You know how hard it is
to do those readings?

377
00:39:24,081 --> 00:39:27,241
Must I remove makeup
and change clothes all by myself?

378
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:30,681
I feel a nightmare coming. Sleep here.

379
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:56,681
He proposed to me.

380
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:01,561
Next full moon,

381
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:06,961
while my uncle visits his mine,
he wants to elope to Japan.

382
00:40:09,481 --> 00:40:11,281
What did you say?

383
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:15,441
I said I wasn't sure.

384
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:16,881
Why?

385
00:40:17,321 --> 00:40:18,721
I'm scared.

386
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:20,841
Of your uncle's anger?

387
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,201
Of the Count.

388
00:40:26,481 --> 00:40:29,321
What's to be scared of'? He's so kind.

389
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:33,881
I don't know, I just feel it.

390
00:40:37,481 --> 00:40:40,441
Like the reflex of pulling
your hand from a flame.

391
00:40:43,681 --> 00:40:45,001
Tell me...

392
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:55,441
What is it that men want?

393
00:40:58,521 --> 00:40:59,681
Pardon?

394
00:41:00,721 --> 00:41:04,281
I mean after getting married, at night...

395
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:11,921
How would I know? I'm practically a child.

396
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:15,281
With no mother. No one here to...

397
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:21,561
First,

398
00:41:23,521 --> 00:41:25,401
I guess we'd kiss?

399
00:41:27,281 --> 00:41:28,761
What the hell.

400
00:41:29,121 --> 00:41:31,641
I'll show her one thing
then put her to bed.

401
00:41:33,601 --> 00:41:34,561
Poor thing,

402
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:41,161
alone in a strange country,
reading those useless books,

403
00:41:41,681 --> 00:41:44,601
without learning a single useful skill.

404
00:42:01,081 --> 00:42:03,521
Why does the candy taste different?

405
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:07,561
The bitter turned sour,

406
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:10,721
the sour turned sweet,

407
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:14,601
the sweet turned savoury...

408
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:16,601
How do you know all this?

409
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,521
You must have experience?

410
00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:24,761
My friend Kutan taught me.

411
00:42:25,401 --> 00:42:27,641
Taught you? In words?

412
00:42:27,761 --> 00:42:30,001
Yes, only in words.

413
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:49,801
So this is how it feels.

414
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:53,201
That's what you will feel for the Count.

415
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:54,841
Really?

416
00:42:55,521 --> 00:42:57,561
The Count, truly...

417
00:43:00,121 --> 00:43:03,361
He won't think he's
making love to a corpse?

418
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:06,961
You know about my cold hands and feet.

419
00:43:07,681 --> 00:43:08,921
Really?

420
00:43:09,481 --> 00:43:10,841
Here.

421
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,601
Feels just fine.

422
00:43:20,921 --> 00:43:22,521
You like it?

423
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:26,761
Do it to me. I want to know how it feels.

424
00:43:30,761 --> 00:43:34,521
I'm sure he'll want to do this too.

425
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:36,921
And then...

426
00:43:43,201 --> 00:43:44,921
It's so cute.

427
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:49,481
If the Count sees this...

428
00:43:59,161 --> 00:44:02,041
Will he really be so tender as this?

429
00:44:02,921 --> 00:44:04,121
Of course.

430
00:44:04,201 --> 00:44:06,721
And he'll touch you like this.

431
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:08,921
And like this...

432
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:15,441
Keep doing it like the Count would.

433
00:44:17,161 --> 00:44:20,361
And this is what he'll say.

434
00:44:22,641 --> 00:44:25,561
It's so soft, warm,

435
00:44:27,521 --> 00:44:29,601
wet, and...

436
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:34,161
s..s..spellbindingly beautiful!

437
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:55,921
Okju.

438
00:44:56,881 --> 00:45:00,401
Hideko.

439
00:45:02,761 --> 00:45:05,241
Mummy.

440
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:08,961
Daddy.

441
00:45:10,401 --> 00:45:12,881
Now, the model must stay still.

442
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:17,201
Okju.

443
00:45:21,161 --> 00:45:24,481
- Hideko...
- Wait.

444
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:26,001
Stop!

445
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:30,241
...doesn't like it, you damned scoundrel!

446
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:33,081
Stop it!

447
00:45:33,161 --> 00:45:34,641
I can't do this.

448
00:45:38,121 --> 00:45:39,641
Come here, Tamako.

449
00:45:43,281 --> 00:45:44,801
Find some other job to do.

450
00:45:44,881 --> 00:45:46,521
You catch my meaning?

451
00:45:55,721 --> 00:45:57,521
I've no other job to do.

452
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:00,841
My job is to look after the Lady.

453
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:14,841
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

454
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:16,721
She's fully ripe! Fully ripe!

455
00:46:16,801 --> 00:46:18,841
If I miss this fortnight, I'm finished!

456
00:46:19,761 --> 00:46:22,121
Can you feel it? How much I want it?

457
00:46:22,201 --> 00:46:26,681
After fighting so hard to escape
my garbage heap of a life,

458
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:30,241
you think I'll let you
fuck it up, you bitch?

459
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:35,401
Shall I tell the Lady you're nothing
but a lowly pickpocket?

460
00:46:35,521 --> 00:46:38,801
Fine, I'll have something to tell her too.

461
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:43,081
That you're nothing but the son of
a lowly Korean farmhand and shaman...

462
00:46:43,241 --> 00:46:44,241
Sookee.

463
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:46,201
Think of your family at home.

464
00:46:46,641 --> 00:46:50,201
Boksun raising babies with her bad back,
and those two halfwits.

465
00:46:50,321 --> 00:46:52,681
How will they feel if you
go home empty-handed?

466
00:46:52,881 --> 00:46:54,721
Want to shit on your mother's legend?

467
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:57,001
You should go home in glory.

468
00:47:01,881 --> 00:47:05,321
So don't push Hideko too hard.

469
00:47:05,481 --> 00:47:06,880
She's got no one on this earth.

470
00:47:06,881 --> 00:47:10,361
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

471
00:47:12,921 --> 00:47:14,521
And please...

472
00:47:15,761 --> 00:47:20,401
Don't ever again put my hand on
your tiny joke of a cock.

473
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:30,121
Oh my.

474
00:47:30,721 --> 00:47:33,681
Your toenails have grown faster
since the Count arrived.

475
00:47:33,801 --> 00:47:35,081
How curious.

476
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:40,361
Miss, doesn't it bother you not to know?

477
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:44,681
How many ships sail on the Wide sea...

478
00:47:44,961 --> 00:47:47,361
People leaving, people returning,

479
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:50,201
those saying farewell or welcome back.

480
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:52,561
What's the farthest you've travelled?

481
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:54,641
The hill beyond the manor?

482
00:47:59,801 --> 00:48:03,841
I could be content here,
if you were with me.

483
00:48:05,121 --> 00:48:06,841
You're fortunate, Miss.

484
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:10,721
The man who loves you has
the power to protect you.

485
00:48:11,161 --> 00:48:12,961
That's rare.

486
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:17,721
But I'm not sure... if I love him.

487
00:48:18,881 --> 00:48:20,561
You do love him.

488
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:24,921
How do you know?

489
00:48:26,761 --> 00:48:28,921
You stare out the window all day.

490
00:48:29,841 --> 00:48:32,041
Turn in your sleep and sigh.

491
00:48:34,281 --> 00:48:35,681
And your toenails.

492
00:48:35,841 --> 00:48:37,721
Even if I say I don't love him,

493
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:41,681
if I say that I love someone else...

494
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:47,081
Me, who has no one on this earth...

495
00:48:47,601 --> 00:48:50,161
Do you still want me to marry him?

496
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,081
You will love him.

497
00:49:10,001 --> 00:49:11,201
Miss!

498
00:49:18,001 --> 00:49:19,081
In the end,

499
00:49:19,161 --> 00:49:23,081
Hideko accepted the proposal,
provided that I come to Japan too.

500
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:25,920
The Count, after feigning
annoyance for a bit,

501
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,641
nodded his head.

502
00:49:29,121 --> 00:49:31,161
On the day her Uncle
left to visit his mine,

503
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:35,521
the Count pretended to go back
to Japan, and hid nearby.

504
00:49:48,041 --> 00:49:50,441
You'll have a week of freedom,

505
00:49:51,481 --> 00:49:55,881
but always remember the basement.

506
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:41,441
Miss!

507
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:30,641
Thank you for travelling on
our ferry today.

508
00:51:30,961 --> 00:51:36,561
We will arrive
at Shimonoseki at 7:30 pm...

509
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:44,241
Finally we're going home.

510
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,721
It's been three years

511
00:52:36,121 --> 00:52:38,121
To not steal...

512
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:40,441
To not steal...

513
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:42,201
To not commit adultery...

514
00:52:42,361 --> 00:52:44,081
To not commit adultery...

515
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:46,721
To not lie...

516
00:52:46,881 --> 00:52:49,441
To not lie...

517
00:53:36,721 --> 00:53:41,641
"Spider thread pulled into strings

518
00:53:42,041 --> 00:53:46,041
"Strumming makes a zither sing

519
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:49,761
"Thousand woes

520
00:53:56,161 --> 00:54:02,521
"Under the blue sky Only the crows cry

521
00:54:03,401 --> 00:54:11,441
"How sorrowful my zither My beloved zither"

522
00:54:17,761 --> 00:54:19,961
Did you sleep well?

523
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:30,841
Excuse me.

524
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:32,241
Sorry.

525
00:54:37,121 --> 00:54:42,161
The Count paid the innkeeper to spy on us,
afraid we might run off.

526
00:54:42,401 --> 00:54:45,921
Why get dressed? I've nothing to do anyway.

527
00:54:47,601 --> 00:54:49,281
Things are moving too slowly.

528
00:54:49,401 --> 00:54:52,881
I fear Hideko might truly go mad.

529
00:54:53,361 --> 00:54:55,801
Shall we play 'maid', like before?

530
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:02,361
From morning to night
we see no sign of the Count.

531
00:55:03,001 --> 00:55:06,761
Certifying the marriage and converting
the inheritance to cash

532
00:55:06,921 --> 00:55:08,801
require much work, he says.

533
00:55:37,361 --> 00:55:39,081
How cruel can you be?

534
00:55:39,161 --> 00:55:42,361
You plucked the flower, now re-plant it.

535
00:55:42,441 --> 00:55:44,241
What do you want?

536
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:47,761
Hurry up and throw her into the madhouse!

537
00:55:55,081 --> 00:55:56,761
A week here...

538
00:55:58,961 --> 00:56:00,721
Then finally...

539
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:44,801
This way.

540
00:56:55,481 --> 00:56:57,321
Who is that person?

541
00:56:59,401 --> 00:57:01,081
The Countess Lady Fujiwara.

542
00:57:01,161 --> 00:57:03,761
Her maiden name was Izumi Hideko.

543
00:57:05,441 --> 00:57:07,201
And who might you be?

544
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:08,961
I am the Lady's handmaiden.

545
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:12,401
Then, what kind of treatment

546
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:15,521
do you believe your Lady requires?

547
00:57:29,481 --> 00:57:32,561
She should be confined in a place

548
00:57:32,721 --> 00:57:38,361
where no one can harm her,
and where she can do no harm.

549
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:45,121
Just a few tests, then let's have
lamb chops at the Peace Hotel.

550
00:57:58,761 --> 00:58:00,961
Almost there. Good work.

551
00:58:02,801 --> 00:58:04,521
Don't be frightened.

552
00:58:38,441 --> 00:58:40,721
Good day, Countess.

553
00:58:41,081 --> 00:58:42,761
Do you remember me?

554
00:58:46,281 --> 00:58:47,801
Countess?

555
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:57,561
What is this?

556
00:58:57,721 --> 00:59:00,561
We mean you no harm, Countess.

557
00:59:00,761 --> 00:59:02,721
We're going to look after you.

558
00:59:03,881 --> 00:59:07,601
You've got the wrong person.
She is the Countess.

559
00:59:08,241 --> 00:59:10,441
Tell them, Your Lordship!

560
00:59:11,601 --> 00:59:15,241
She still believes
she's a Korean handmaiden.

561
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:20,241
It's because her nanny was Korean.

562
00:59:20,921 --> 00:59:22,681
You scoundrel!

563
00:59:23,881 --> 00:59:25,761
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

564
00:59:26,161 --> 00:59:29,401
We do not use such language here,
your Ladyship.

565
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:30,881
Miss!

566
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:39,281
My poor Lady, she's gone nutty.

567
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,441
If it's any help,

568
00:59:42,521 --> 00:59:44,681
this is from her mammy,

569
00:59:44,761 --> 00:59:50,481
and she used to cherish it
before going mad.

570
00:59:54,681 --> 00:59:57,281
Such a considerate maid.

571
00:59:59,201 --> 01:00:02,361
You thought Hideko a lamb.

572
01:00:02,961 --> 01:00:04,961
Lamb, my arse.

573
01:00:06,241 --> 01:00:09,841
I tell you, right from
the start Miss Izumi Hideko...

574
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:14,401
had always been...

575
01:00:14,801 --> 01:00:16,241
Miss!

576
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:18,721
...a rotten bitch.

577
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:25,840
'PART TWO'

578
01:00:25,841 --> 01:00:30,321
I'm not a rotten bitch! No! No!

579
01:00:36,401 --> 01:00:38,761
Put it in your mouth, Hideko.

580
01:00:41,481 --> 01:00:43,041
Hold out your hand.

581
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:07,881
Next time you feel like talking back,

582
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:11,681
remember the taste of this metal bead.

583
01:01:17,481 --> 01:01:20,361
You'll sleep alone from tonight.

584
01:01:30,041 --> 01:01:30,841
All right?

585
01:01:30,961 --> 01:01:32,401
Please give me a light.

586
01:01:32,761 --> 01:01:35,881
We've been ordered to save oil.

587
01:01:36,481 --> 01:01:38,041
You little brat.

588
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:39,681
Speak Japanese!

589
01:01:42,161 --> 01:01:45,681
In there is a man the size of an ogre

590
01:01:45,961 --> 01:01:50,121
who can't stand
the sound of girls screaming.

591
01:01:50,561 --> 01:01:54,201
If he hears you, he'll burst in
through that door after you.

592
01:01:55,081 --> 01:01:56,841
And then?

593
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:03,801
He'll smother you with his giant body.

594
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:07,081
So you can't make a sound.

595
01:02:20,321 --> 01:02:21,641
Aunt.

596
01:02:21,961 --> 01:02:23,521
My, my.

597
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:27,921
Scaring a little girl like that.

598
01:03:15,761 --> 01:03:17,241
And me?

599
01:03:18,481 --> 01:03:20,601
Am I pretty too?

600
01:03:23,921 --> 01:03:25,761
Look closely.

601
01:03:30,201 --> 01:03:33,841
Everyone says I can't compare

602
01:03:34,441 --> 01:03:36,441
to my big sister.

603
01:03:39,281 --> 01:03:40,401
Day.

604
01:03:40,641 --> 01:03:41,641
Night.

605
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:43,081
Day.

606
01:03:43,521 --> 01:03:44,761
Night.

607
01:03:45,401 --> 01:03:46,401
Man.

608
01:03:46,921 --> 01:03:48,321
Woman.

609
01:03:48,561 --> 01:03:49,761
Man.

610
01:03:50,321 --> 01:03:51,441
Woman.

611
01:03:54,481 --> 01:03:55,601
Eye.

612
01:03:55,961 --> 01:03:57,121
Nose.

613
01:03:57,681 --> 01:03:58,801
Mouth.

614
01:03:59,441 --> 01:04:00,761
Ear.

615
01:04:01,361 --> 01:04:02,641
Shoulder.

616
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:04,241
Nipple.

617
01:04:04,561 --> 01:04:05,641
Navel.

618
01:04:06,281 --> 01:04:07,201
Eye.

619
01:04:07,441 --> 01:04:08,761
Nose.

620
01:04:09,001 --> 01:04:10,281
Mouth.

621
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:11,801
Ear.

622
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:13,161
Shoulder.

623
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:14,721
Nipple.

624
01:04:15,121 --> 01:04:16,281
Navel.

625
01:04:19,361 --> 01:04:20,521
Penis.

626
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:22,321
Vagina.

627
01:04:27,921 --> 01:04:30,201
P... penis.

628
01:04:30,601 --> 01:04:32,041
Vagina.

629
01:05:06,601 --> 01:05:10,081
You think if you speak Korean,
I won't understand?

630
01:05:12,561 --> 01:05:17,241
I was going a bit crazy,
so I made them crazy too.

631
01:05:21,361 --> 01:05:24,281
When Mrs. Sasaki looked as crazy as me,

632
01:05:24,561 --> 01:05:26,961
life was more bearable.

633
01:05:29,001 --> 01:05:32,761
I know you are a bit insane.

634
01:05:33,481 --> 01:05:36,801
It runs in your mother's family.

635
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:39,841
That's why I'm training you.

636
01:05:39,921 --> 01:05:41,521
To set your mind right.

637
01:05:41,601 --> 01:05:46,401
If I fail, there's a place called
a "mental hospital" in Japan.

638
01:05:49,921 --> 01:05:52,561
Established by the rational Germans,

639
01:05:52,641 --> 01:05:56,321
it's very effective
in treating lunacy.

640
01:05:56,801 --> 01:06:00,441
They dig holes in the dirt,
put a patient in each one,

641
01:06:00,481 --> 01:06:01,841
and put lids on top.

642
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:06,161
If patients improve they get a leash,

643
01:06:06,241 --> 01:06:08,681
so they can crawl around like dogs.

644
01:06:34,481 --> 01:06:38,121
The cherry tree that came with me
on the ship from Japan

645
01:06:38,201 --> 01:06:40,001
bloomed twice.

646
01:06:41,361 --> 01:06:44,361
"When Jinlian finally
took off her clothes,

647
01:06:44,481 --> 01:06:47,521
"Ximen-Qing-examined her-Jade-Gate...

"to-find-it-hairless-white-as-snow
and-smooth-as-jade..

649
01:06:53,721 --> 01:06:56,321
You must pause between words.

650
01:06:56,681 --> 01:06:59,841
Don't read like a dog
lapping at his plate!

651
01:07:01,921 --> 01:07:05,001
Listen to your aunt read.

652
01:07:11,481 --> 01:07:15,841
"When Jinlian finally
took off her clothes,

653
01:07:15,961 --> 01:07:20,801

"to find it hairless, white as snow,

01:07:30,721 --> 01:07:33,161
"and soft as silk.

"Once he drew apart
the curtains of flesh,

"it twitched and twitched."

665
01:08:34,681 --> 01:08:38,841
Everyone wanted to cut it down,
but my uncle refused.

666
01:08:39,521 --> 01:08:44,401
He said this tree from Mt. Fuji
had absorbed my aunt's soul.

667
01:08:44,961 --> 01:08:50,281
The servants whispered it was
due to the tree's high cost,

668
01:08:50,361 --> 01:08:53,481
but I think my uncle was right.

669
01:08:53,801 --> 01:08:56,121
You can tell from the cherry blossoms,

670
01:08:56,521 --> 01:08:59,601
which turned brighter and bloomed longer.

671
01:09:31,681 --> 01:09:34,001
"Tell me, Juliette.

672
01:09:34,121 --> 01:09:40,921
"Do you wish this impetuous
young knight to save you?

673
01:09:46,281 --> 01:09:50,001
"The duchess shook
her head resolutely,

674
01:09:50,161 --> 01:09:53,241
"to my great disappointment.

...my brave knight.

680
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:20,241
When you see these old scars
and the fresh pink wounds,

681
01:10:20,441 --> 01:10:22,841
what do you feel?

682
01:10:25,681 --> 01:10:27,921
I pity the poor woman.

683
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:32,841
I wish to lick her and lick her,
caress her and caress her.

684
01:10:33,841 --> 01:10:36,241
If you pity her so,

685
01:10:36,961 --> 01:10:41,241
why not take her place
and let her whip you?

686
01:10:47,761 --> 01:10:51,921
"The duchess raised the whip high
in the air, and then...

"And again...

688
01:11:08,201 --> 01:11:11,521
"My cock became painfully erect."

689
01:11:16,921 --> 01:11:20,681
If she could be yours for ten minutes,

690
01:11:20,801 --> 01:11:22,721
what would you give in exchange?

691
01:11:23,521 --> 01:11:26,641
Whatever your heart desires.

692
01:11:26,921 --> 01:11:29,761
Anything in this whole wide world.

693
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:34,561
"Once the duke untied me,

694
01:11:34,641 --> 01:11:38,241
"I sat on the chair, pulled her to me,

"As I felt the duke
approach from behind,

"a rope slithered around my neck.

01:12:02,121 --> 01:12:05,001
"The duke slowly tightened the rope.

700
01:12:05,121 --> 01:12:09,561
"Like a drowning
man grasping at straws,

"I pulled the swirling
currents of her hair.

702
01:12:15,121 --> 01:12:17,681
"Then the duke spoke.

01:12:19,801 --> 01:12:22,681
"The ten minutes are almost up.

704
01:12:31,961 --> 01:12:34,201
" 'Slowly, my dear',
said the Duchess...

705
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:41,201
"I haven't yet fully
savoured his pain.

706
01:12:46,761 --> 01:12:50,841
"No, the knight cried, 'don't stop!'

707
01:12:52,161 --> 01:12:55,081
"Please let me die

"in the midst of this pain.

"In this suffocating pain."

710
01:13:33,441 --> 01:13:35,281
Is it Sade?

711
01:13:35,601 --> 01:13:37,481
It's Sade-esque.

712
01:13:37,681 --> 01:13:42,761
Believed to be the same Japanese man
who wrote 'The Lizard Skin'.

713
01:13:43,321 --> 01:13:47,761
Acquired from a Japanese sailor on
a ship from Hamburg.

714
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:54,481
Can you imagine my joy when,

715
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:59,241
after such a journey, it sat on
my shelf with its brothers?

716
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:04,201
These are the babes to whom
I feel the most affection.

717
01:14:05,481 --> 01:14:11,281
It used to contain an elaborate
monochrome woodcut illustration,

718
01:14:13,401 --> 01:14:14,801
but as you can see...

719
01:14:14,841 --> 01:14:16,521
So unfortunate.

720
01:14:17,001 --> 01:14:20,961
If that were intact,
you could've named your price.

721
01:14:21,681 --> 01:14:25,561
The author felt words alone
could not fully describe the positions,

722
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:29,281
and so included an illustration.

723
01:14:30,561 --> 01:14:33,841
In that regard,
before we start the bidding.

724
01:14:34,561 --> 01:14:35,801
Hideko!

725
01:14:39,001 --> 01:14:41,321
'Pain is a Garment'

726
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:54,361
Beautiful!

727
01:16:00,601 --> 01:16:02,241
See you again.

728
01:16:03,121 --> 01:16:04,681
Yes, thank you.

729
01:16:04,721 --> 01:16:07,801
Today's reading was outstanding.

730
01:16:08,721 --> 01:16:10,641
Yes, thank you.

731
01:16:11,841 --> 01:16:13,641
Especially the puppet!

732
01:16:20,321 --> 01:16:23,721
You are of noble birth,

733
01:16:24,081 --> 01:16:26,681
yet you engage in
the lowly work of copying paintings.

734
01:16:26,761 --> 01:16:29,801
There was a time when

735
01:16:29,881 --> 01:16:33,521
I dissipated my wit
and skills on gambling.

736
01:16:33,601 --> 01:16:38,921
Imagine the torment of having
so many women make advances on me,

737
01:16:39,001 --> 01:16:42,241
when I couldn't afford to buy them
a glass of Burgundy.

738
01:16:43,161 --> 01:16:47,241
Do the women here advance on you?

739
01:16:47,841 --> 01:16:49,921
I look at women's eyes.

740
01:16:50,001 --> 01:16:51,401
Only the eyes.

741
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:54,881
They turn their gaze away,

742
01:16:56,001 --> 01:16:58,281
but then they always look back.

743
01:16:59,241 --> 01:17:03,841
If I were to slide under
someone's covers tonight,

744
01:17:04,121 --> 01:17:08,281
only one woman here would refuse me.

745
01:17:08,881 --> 01:17:11,401
Does that include Mrs. Sasaki?

746
01:17:12,121 --> 01:17:14,561
Is she not your former wife?

747
01:17:14,841 --> 01:17:17,881
You left her to
marry a Japanese woman.

748
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:21,881
But the servants tell me
you still share a bed with her.

749
01:17:22,201 --> 01:17:24,481
You went so far as
to abandon your wife,

750
01:17:24,521 --> 01:17:26,841
why this urge to become Japanese?

751
01:17:29,201 --> 01:17:31,281
Because Korea is ugly

752
01:17:31,321 --> 01:17:34,241
and Japan is beautiful.

753
01:17:35,161 --> 01:17:38,201
Some Japanese say Japan is ugly,

754
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:40,121
and Korea is beautiful.

755
01:17:40,321 --> 01:17:42,601
Beauty is cruel by nature.

756
01:17:42,681 --> 01:17:46,481
Korea is soft, slow, dull,
and therefore hopeless.

757
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:51,761
Does it include Mrs. Sasaki?

758
01:17:52,681 --> 01:17:54,281
If I gave her the right signal,

759
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:58,881
she'd knock on my door
without her underwear.

760
01:18:02,561 --> 01:18:04,841
My thoughts exactly.

761
01:18:06,601 --> 01:18:08,281
Then who is it?

762
01:18:08,481 --> 01:18:11,121
The one who would deny you?

763
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:15,841
I heard you own the highest quality

764
01:18:15,881 --> 01:18:19,521
antique bookmaking
tools of East and West,

765
01:18:20,201 --> 01:18:21,761
but I don't see them here?

766
01:18:21,881 --> 01:18:25,441
Who would deny you?

767
01:18:28,081 --> 01:18:32,481
I met Hideko's eyes by chance,
but she didn't look away.

768
01:18:32,801 --> 01:18:35,961
Indeed it was I who shifted my gaze.

769
01:18:36,121 --> 01:18:43,041
Will she make an appearance in
your lewd dreams tonight?

770
01:18:44,561 --> 01:18:47,401
Even if honoured with such a visit,

771
01:18:47,641 --> 01:18:49,761
I don't think I could consummate.

772
01:18:50,241 --> 01:18:54,001
Because her body would be
as cold as waterfowl.

773
01:18:58,321 --> 01:19:00,961
The result of long training.

774
01:19:04,561 --> 01:19:07,801
I heard you are engaged to her.

775
01:19:07,961 --> 01:19:15,161
If I'm not mistaken,
you are yet to have intercourse?

776
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:18,561
Her eyes have no desire.

777
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:21,881
It means her soul is dead inside.

778
01:19:23,361 --> 01:19:25,401
You should go easy on her training,

779
01:19:25,721 --> 01:19:29,281
unless you enjoy
making love to a corpse.

780
01:20:18,601 --> 01:20:22,081
My particular way
of possessing beauty.

781
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:26,881
Hideko too must have
received painting lessons?

782
01:20:27,201 --> 01:20:30,281
I was too occupied teaching her
to read with correct diction.

783
01:20:31,441 --> 01:20:32,641
Dear me!

784
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:34,881
In England, where I studied,

785
01:20:35,001 --> 01:20:40,681
all ladies were expected to produce
vibrant colour and graceful lines,

786
01:20:41,921 --> 01:20:44,001
even in the less noble families.

787
01:20:58,081 --> 01:21:00,281
A phone call, sir.

788
01:21:00,921 --> 01:21:02,681
At this hour?

789
01:21:02,801 --> 01:21:04,961
It's the Iwamura Bookstore.

790
01:21:05,401 --> 01:21:06,441
Is that so?

791
01:21:06,721 --> 01:21:08,481
Excuse me a moment.

792
01:21:18,161 --> 01:21:20,201
You are Mesmerising.

793
01:21:21,521 --> 01:21:23,081
Men use the word "Mesmerising"

794
01:21:23,161 --> 01:21:27,161
when they wish to
touch a lady's breasts.

795
01:21:28,081 --> 01:21:31,441
I'm familiar with Western
conversational etiquette.

796
01:21:33,561 --> 01:21:36,601
I do a bit of reading, you know.

797
01:21:37,041 --> 01:21:39,361
There was no
calculation in what I said.

798
01:21:39,441 --> 01:21:44,201
It was a reflex, like pulling
one's hand from a flame.

799
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:46,481
I'm no flame.

800
01:21:46,681 --> 01:21:50,201
I'm cold as waterfowl, your Lordship.

801
01:21:55,761 --> 01:21:57,761
He will return soon.

802
01:21:57,881 --> 01:22:00,361
Mr. Iwamura only called
with a frivolous inquiry,

803
01:22:00,441 --> 01:22:02,361
at my request.

804
01:22:02,481 --> 01:22:05,961
There's an issue regarding
your future you should know.

805
01:22:06,081 --> 01:22:09,401
I'll wait by the
stone lamp at midnight.

806
01:22:10,761 --> 01:22:14,321
That Iwamura is a real fool.

807
01:23:00,761 --> 01:23:02,841
My maid is asleep
in the room next door.

808
01:23:02,921 --> 01:23:05,281
I don't fancy being in
scandalous rumours with you.

809
01:23:05,361 --> 01:23:08,521
I saw Junko go to the servants'
quarters with her pillow.

810
01:23:08,601 --> 01:23:11,241
Consider your
reputation as a nobleman.

811
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:13,161
I'm no nobleman.

812
01:23:13,241 --> 01:23:14,921
I'm not even Japanese.

813
01:23:15,001 --> 01:23:17,841
Think it was easy for a Korean
farmhand's son to reach here?

814
01:23:18,441 --> 01:23:21,881
Fifteen hard years in Japan
before hearing about you.

815
01:23:22,361 --> 01:23:24,401
Another three years to prepare.

816
01:23:24,881 --> 01:23:27,841
I studied bookmaking
and learned to paint forgeries.

817
01:23:28,361 --> 01:23:30,521
All so that I could meet you.

818
01:23:30,681 --> 01:23:32,121
To seduce and marry you,

819
01:23:32,201 --> 01:23:34,641
to possess your father's inheritance,

820
01:23:35,201 --> 01:23:37,321
and then probably to get rid of you.

821
01:23:38,921 --> 01:23:40,681
But I knew as soon as I met you.

822
01:23:40,801 --> 01:23:42,601
For a man to seduce you would be...

823
01:23:44,961 --> 01:23:46,761
...impossible.

824
01:23:47,761 --> 01:23:51,281
So in place of seduction,
I decided to propose a deal.

825
01:23:52,321 --> 01:23:55,921
Most marriages are prison,
but this one will free you.

826
01:23:56,481 --> 01:23:58,121
I'll rescue you from here,

827
01:23:58,361 --> 01:24:01,801
take you far away, and give you freedom.

828
01:24:03,161 --> 01:24:05,641
Of course, we'll split the money.

829
01:24:06,361 --> 01:24:07,601
Nonsense.

830
01:24:08,641 --> 01:24:12,881
Marrying an old man with a black tongue
at your tender age makes sense?

831
01:24:12,961 --> 01:24:14,761
I won't marry anyone.

832
01:24:15,241 --> 01:24:16,841
What have you in mind?

833
01:24:22,121 --> 01:24:23,681
That's not proper.

834
01:24:23,961 --> 01:24:25,521
There's no beauty in that.

835
01:24:25,801 --> 01:24:28,241
If you kill yourself, what of your fortune?

836
01:24:28,601 --> 01:24:33,001
That will be the sum of your efforts?
Your fortune going to a pervert?

837
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:37,001
So he can buy 10 little girls
and teach them to read books?

838
01:24:38,441 --> 01:24:40,761
My uncle will find us somehow.

839
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:43,241
Then he'll take us to the basement.

840
01:24:43,401 --> 01:24:44,441
Uncle.

841
01:24:45,441 --> 01:24:46,361
The basement?

842
01:24:46,441 --> 01:24:49,481
It says here when people are hanged,

843
01:24:49,721 --> 01:24:54,561
their tongues stick out
and faeces is expelled.

844
01:24:55,321 --> 01:24:59,281
But that day, Aunt's mouth was shut

845
01:25:00,081 --> 01:25:02,201
and her bottom was clean.

846
01:25:03,361 --> 01:25:05,561
Want to go somewhere nice?

847
01:25:22,361 --> 01:25:26,081
I'll tell you in detail
what I did to your aunt

848
01:25:26,201 --> 01:25:28,201
after I caught her running away.

849
01:25:28,401 --> 01:25:32,881
So don't you ever think
of running, understood?

850
01:25:50,041 --> 01:25:53,081
That day I just watched and listened.

851
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:55,681
But if I ever end up there again...

852
01:26:00,281 --> 01:26:02,001
Highly concentrated opium.

853
01:26:02,081 --> 01:26:04,161
Three drops will make you sleep all day.

854
01:26:04,281 --> 01:26:07,001
Five drops will knock down a horse.

855
01:26:07,121 --> 01:26:09,441
If you crave death within five minutes,

856
01:26:09,761 --> 01:26:11,361
drink it all.

857
01:26:11,561 --> 01:26:14,841
If you carry this, he can never take you
to the basement.

858
01:26:14,921 --> 01:26:16,641
At least not alive.

859
01:26:16,961 --> 01:26:19,081
It'll be my wedding gift to you.

860
01:26:19,281 --> 01:26:21,241
It's more expensive than jewels.

861
01:26:32,041 --> 01:26:36,841
Bring a girl to be my maid. One who could
disappear and not be missed.

862
01:26:37,081 --> 01:26:38,841
If a bit dense, all the better.

863
01:26:38,921 --> 01:26:42,801
We'll send her to a madhouse under my name.

864
01:26:43,521 --> 01:26:45,721
I can find you a new maid,

865
01:26:45,841 --> 01:26:47,881
but what do we do about Junko?

866
01:26:53,281 --> 01:26:57,961
You really think I'm prettier than
Miss Hideko?

867
01:26:59,241 --> 01:27:03,041
Sure, Hideko's pretty, and you're pretty.

868
01:27:03,281 --> 01:27:05,321
What? You speak Korean?

869
01:27:06,481 --> 01:27:08,281
You know...

870
01:27:08,921 --> 01:27:10,401
I learned it.

871
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:12,721
To speak more easily with you.

872
01:27:14,361 --> 01:27:16,921
I really wanted to say this to you.

873
01:27:18,241 --> 01:27:19,721
You are just Mesmerising.

874
01:27:19,761 --> 01:27:21,201
Oh my gosh!

875
01:27:23,121 --> 01:27:24,641
You little tart!

876
01:27:29,481 --> 01:27:31,161
I can't!

877
01:27:31,801 --> 01:27:35,441
If they catch me with a guest,
I'll be thrown out!

878
01:27:35,561 --> 01:27:39,961
Forget this wretched place.
Come live with me!

879
01:28:24,561 --> 01:28:26,001
Oh, fucking hell!

880
01:28:26,961 --> 01:28:28,121
Fucking hell?

881
01:28:28,201 --> 01:28:29,321
Fucking hell...

882
01:28:57,881 --> 01:29:00,481
The Count sent exactly what I ordered.

883
01:29:00,561 --> 01:29:02,841
Naive and a bit foolish.

884
01:29:06,081 --> 01:29:07,561
Mother!

885
01:29:18,281 --> 01:29:22,921
"Show Sookee your clothes
and jewellery at every opportunity.

886
01:29:23,201 --> 01:29:27,121
"The material greed she got from her mother
will make her more gullible.

887
01:29:27,481 --> 01:29:32,921
"P.S. Don't worry if she reads this letter,
she's totally illiterate."

888
01:29:33,281 --> 01:29:35,161
Would you read it to me?

889
01:29:35,321 --> 01:29:36,161
Pardon?

890
01:29:36,281 --> 01:29:37,121
'Countess Fujiwara Hideko'

891
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:40,841
This is your name. Can't you read it?

892
01:29:45,041 --> 01:29:46,881
What's with your foot?

893
01:29:50,761 --> 01:29:52,041
Who did it?

894
01:29:52,281 --> 01:29:54,521
Who took Tamako's shoe?

895
01:30:01,241 --> 01:30:03,441
Apologise before all the servants!

896
01:30:06,561 --> 01:30:09,361
If she ever runs away
because of one of you,

897
01:30:09,481 --> 01:30:11,601
I'll strip you all naked
and throw you out!

898
01:30:12,881 --> 01:30:13,841
Fucking hell.

899
01:30:18,481 --> 01:30:20,041
All smooth.

900
01:30:26,441 --> 01:30:28,241
You like the scent?

901
01:30:28,561 --> 01:30:30,121
Want to come in?

902
01:30:30,281 --> 01:30:31,281
Pardon?

903
01:30:47,681 --> 01:30:49,361
No need to be ashamed at all.

904
01:30:49,441 --> 01:30:51,641
Your average fence can
barely tell them apart.

905
01:30:51,721 --> 01:30:53,521
Is that so?

906
01:30:58,961 --> 01:31:01,281
"Returning the earrings you loaned me.

907
01:31:01,441 --> 01:31:04,481
"A woman might wager her fate on
such an exquisite pair.

908
01:31:05,361 --> 01:31:09,641
"I'm sure that Sookee
will try her very best

909
01:31:10,001 --> 01:31:12,521
"in order to see herself wearing
these in the mirror.

910
01:31:12,961 --> 01:31:16,241
"I'll tell you how to keep her
from getting suspicious.

911
01:31:16,401 --> 01:31:19,561
"Keep her busy until the
day of the wedding.

912
01:31:19,961 --> 01:31:21,881
"Make her spend all her energy

913
01:31:21,961 --> 01:31:24,281
"on making you fall in love with me.

914
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:29,481
"In other words, don't fall in love
with me so easily."

915
01:31:31,321 --> 01:31:32,441
Me'?

916
01:31:40,881 --> 01:31:43,681
Dressed up, you look like a lady too.

917
01:31:50,841 --> 01:31:53,361
How did your mum die?

918
01:31:53,601 --> 01:31:57,281
That she was so lucky to
have you before dying.

919
01:31:57,721 --> 01:31:59,961
That she had no regrets.

920
01:32:01,001 --> 01:32:04,841
Is this the companionship
they write about in books?

921
01:32:12,561 --> 01:32:14,441
Men are disgusting.

922
01:32:14,561 --> 01:32:17,081
How can they be so single-minded?

923
01:32:17,761 --> 01:32:19,281
What's on my mind?

924
01:32:20,241 --> 01:32:23,441
You don't really believe that
I crave your body?

925
01:32:25,361 --> 01:32:26,481
You do!

926
01:32:26,561 --> 01:32:28,121
You read too many of those books.

927
01:32:28,241 --> 01:32:30,361
If there's one thing I'm after, Miss...

928
01:32:31,041 --> 01:32:36,081
It's not your eyes, your hands or ass,

929
01:32:36,281 --> 01:32:39,081
it's your money, only that.

930
01:32:39,281 --> 01:32:42,761
Of all that you have, money is the best.

931
01:32:43,521 --> 01:32:46,601
Feels great being so rude to a noble lady.

932
01:32:47,321 --> 01:32:48,801
What's with her?

933
01:32:49,561 --> 01:32:53,321
Why does she stomp her feet,
expressing her anger,

934
01:32:53,521 --> 01:32:56,681
sit up in the middle of the night and sigh?

935
01:32:57,601 --> 01:33:01,841
Every time she sees the Count,
her eyes seem to say,

936
01:33:02,361 --> 01:33:04,161
I despise you.

937
01:33:04,841 --> 01:33:09,721
Try to bear it. Only if she sees this
will she believe the proposal.

938
01:33:28,281 --> 01:33:32,201
Think of me as that puppet,
and I'll imagine another woman.

939
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:34,241
What woman?

940
01:33:36,921 --> 01:33:39,161
The duchess Juliette.

941
01:33:41,161 --> 01:33:42,761
Lady!

942
01:33:43,441 --> 01:33:44,961
Milord!

943
01:33:50,241 --> 01:33:51,601
Lady...

944
01:33:55,241 --> 01:33:58,841
"The lady's emotions
lay deep inside...

945
01:33:59,241 --> 01:34:01,921
"Jinlian could not
fathom their depths.

946
01:34:03,601 --> 01:34:05,561
"Knowing this, Lady Sun

947
01:34:05,721 --> 01:34:09,561
"gave Jinlian four small silver balls.

948
01:34:09,721 --> 01:34:13,761
"These are 'minling',
or 'bells of passion.'

949
01:34:14,201 --> 01:34:17,441
"Place two in the lady's Jade Gate,

950
01:34:17,721 --> 01:34:21,401
"and the other two in yours.

951
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:25,201
"Spread your legs apart

952
01:34:25,281 --> 01:34:27,561
"and like two scissors

953
01:34:27,681 --> 01:34:30,081
"trying to cut each other,
put them together.

954
01:34:30,161 --> 01:34:32,881
"When the lips below rub
against each another,

955
01:34:32,961 --> 01:34:34,921
"you'll hear a clear ringing sound."

956
01:34:35,001 --> 01:34:36,881
A blackout! Bring a lantern!

957
01:34:37,001 --> 01:34:38,521
Yes, sir!

958
01:34:38,641 --> 01:34:40,521
'The Sound of Bells on a Windless Night'

959
01:34:42,321 --> 01:34:46,361
" 'When do I put
this in?' asked Jinlian."

960
01:34:47,121 --> 01:34:51,521
"Does the lady breathe deeply
and swallow hard?

961
01:34:52,881 --> 01:34:55,761
"Does she whisper sweetly in your ear,

962
01:34:55,881 --> 01:34:57,601
"and kiss you?

963
01:35:02,401 --> 01:35:04,401
"Does she embrace you tightly

964
01:35:04,481 --> 01:35:06,721
"and caress your nipples?

965
01:35:08,681 --> 01:35:10,921
"Does her secret part become slippery

966
01:35:11,001 --> 01:35:13,481
"as she gently bites your shoulder?

967
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:17,201
"Then, put in the bells."

968
01:35:22,241 --> 01:35:24,081
- Amazing!
- Indeed!

969
01:35:42,561 --> 01:35:44,561
It's so cute.

970
01:35:49,761 --> 01:35:52,281
If the Count sees this...

971
01:35:58,281 --> 01:36:01,121
Will he really be so tender as this?

972
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:03,521
Of course.

973
01:36:03,601 --> 01:36:06,961
And he'll touch you like this...

974
01:36:07,321 --> 01:36:09,001
And like this...

975
01:36:16,481 --> 01:36:18,681
Tamako, keep doing it.

976
01:36:19,601 --> 01:36:21,561
Like the Count would.

977
01:36:23,721 --> 01:36:25,161
The Count...

978
01:36:25,361 --> 01:36:26,881
The Count...

979
01:36:27,161 --> 01:36:29,601
He'll go crazy over this.

980
01:36:31,801 --> 01:36:35,321
And this is what he'll say.

981
01:36:37,361 --> 01:36:42,881
It's so soft, warm, wet, and...

982
01:36:46,721 --> 01:36:50,801
's..s..spellbindingly beautiful!

983
01:37:21,121 --> 01:37:24,161
Shall I teach you more, Miss?

984
01:37:25,361 --> 01:37:26,641
Yes...

985
01:37:26,761 --> 01:37:28,841
Teach me everything.

986
01:38:10,961 --> 01:38:15,881
I wish that I had breast milk
so I could feed you.

987
01:38:29,961 --> 01:38:32,241
Do you like it when I do this?

988
01:38:33,201 --> 01:38:34,761
Do you like me?

989
01:38:36,321 --> 01:38:39,001
Can you promise that you won't betray me?

990
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:42,241
I'll never...

991
01:38:42,401 --> 01:38:44,161
never...

992
01:38:44,761 --> 01:38:46,481
ever...

993
01:38:59,721 --> 01:39:05,201
Miss, how could such an innocent...

994
01:39:05,881 --> 01:39:07,721
You must be a natural.

995
01:40:01,321 --> 01:40:02,521
Stop!

996
01:40:04,321 --> 01:40:07,121
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

997
01:40:07,801 --> 01:40:09,281
She's got no one on this earth.

998
01:40:09,361 --> 01:40:12,481
If you frighten her, she'll close up
hard as a clam.

999
01:40:19,201 --> 01:40:20,401
You see?

1000
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:24,201
If you don't give the impression
you want this marriage,

1001
01:40:24,281 --> 01:40:27,361
she may throw another fit
and refuse to go forward.

1002
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:30,601
Be more convincing when
you pretend to love me.

1003
01:40:30,681 --> 01:40:31,921
I can't do it.

1004
01:40:32,001 --> 01:40:33,161
What?

1005
01:40:33,561 --> 01:40:35,161
I want to quit.

1006
01:40:36,241 --> 01:40:38,801
What's with you all today?

1007
01:40:40,481 --> 01:40:42,041
You feel sorry for her?

1008
01:40:45,201 --> 01:40:47,561
What is it with women?

1009
01:40:50,201 --> 01:40:53,721
You know what that poor Sookee
said about your Ladyship?

1010
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:57,681
That you're too dense to get it
if someone pulls on your nipples.

1011
01:40:57,801 --> 01:41:00,561
That she was nice out of pity,
but you ate it up.

1012
01:41:00,641 --> 01:41:02,361
That you were so gullible!

1013
01:41:02,441 --> 01:41:05,681
That naive servant's face...

1014
01:41:05,921 --> 01:41:08,201
Yes... you will love him.

1015
01:41:08,321 --> 01:41:11,321
If I say that I love someone else...

1016
01:41:12,601 --> 01:41:16,601
Me, who has no one on this earth...

1017
01:41:17,281 --> 01:41:19,561
Do you still want me to marry him?

1018
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:21,001
Yes.

1019
01:41:32,081 --> 01:41:33,281
Miss!

1020
01:41:54,961 --> 01:41:57,881
I wish I'd never been born.

1021
01:42:09,961 --> 01:42:13,001
I wish I'd never been born.

1022
01:42:32,321 --> 01:42:33,681
Let go.

1023
01:42:35,841 --> 01:42:38,841
Miss, I'm sorry!

1024
01:42:41,281 --> 01:42:42,281
Let go!

1025
01:42:42,681 --> 01:42:44,601
I'm sorry, Miss!

1026
01:42:44,961 --> 01:42:46,321
Don't die.

1027
01:42:46,761 --> 01:42:48,561
I'm sorry.

1028
01:42:50,441 --> 01:42:52,441
What are you sorry about?

1029
01:42:53,481 --> 01:42:57,921
I tried to trick you into
marrying that bastard.

1030
01:42:58,121 --> 01:43:01,281
I was going to put you in
a madhouse and run off.

1031
01:43:02,441 --> 01:43:06,361
Don't die. Don't get married, Miss!

1032
01:43:08,361 --> 01:43:11,881
Sookee, are you worried about me?

1033
01:43:17,041 --> 01:43:18,601
I'm worried about you.

1034
01:43:23,921 --> 01:43:26,761
How do you know my name?

1035
01:43:27,841 --> 01:43:30,161
You think you're tricking me?

1036
01:43:32,321 --> 01:43:34,281
You're the one being tricked.

1037
01:43:35,241 --> 01:43:37,401
You're the one bound for the madhouse.

1038
01:43:39,561 --> 01:43:42,321
I was going to lock you up in there
under my name,

1039
01:43:42,681 --> 01:43:45,801
then I'd become you and
run far away, with him.

1040
01:43:50,281 --> 01:43:53,841
I won't say sorry, since you tried
to trick me too.

1041
01:44:00,601 --> 01:44:03,201
That fucking son of a bitch!

1042
01:44:06,001 --> 01:44:08,121
Oh, sorry Miss!

1043
01:44:08,201 --> 01:44:12,161
"I hope this letter finds you well.
This is Sookee.

1044
01:44:12,441 --> 01:44:16,521
"I'm writing to inform you
of a change in plans.

1045
01:44:16,601 --> 01:44:21,321
"I decided to team up with the Lady Hideko.

1046
01:44:21,401 --> 01:44:24,281
"As such, I'm now in need of all your help.

1047
01:44:24,361 --> 01:44:26,721
"I'm enclosing an item as advance payment."

1048
01:44:26,801 --> 01:44:30,921
Always remember the basement.

1049
01:44:44,841 --> 01:44:47,081
Want to go somewhere nice?

1050
01:45:17,481 --> 01:45:19,961
You didn't teach me to read Japanese.

1051
01:45:41,321 --> 01:45:43,201
Did that bastard draw this?

1052
01:45:45,681 --> 01:45:50,361
Is this what you've been reading to
that dirty old man

1053
01:45:50,921 --> 01:45:52,641
and those gentlemen?

1054
01:47:53,761 --> 01:47:56,081
The daughter of a legendary thief,

1055
01:47:56,161 --> 01:47:58,801
who sewed winter coats
out of stolen purses.

1056
01:47:59,081 --> 01:48:02,281
Herself a thief, pickpocket, swindler.

1057
01:48:03,241 --> 01:48:06,121
The saviour who came to tear my life apart.

1058
01:48:06,201 --> 01:48:07,881
My Tamako.

1059
01:48:08,481 --> 01:48:10,081
My Sookee.

1060
01:48:59,081 --> 01:49:00,761
You scoundrel!

1061
01:49:01,001 --> 01:49:03,161
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

1062
01:49:04,761 --> 01:49:06,081
Miss!

1063
01:49:06,681 --> 01:49:08,001
Let go!

1064
01:49:09,761 --> 01:49:10,921
Miss!

1065
01:49:25,521 --> 01:49:26,961
I'm hungry.

1066
01:49:30,961 --> 01:49:35,521
The first month, I ordered
a slim herringbone suit.

1067
01:49:36,081 --> 01:49:38,960
The next month, I wore it to dine
at the Imperial Hotel.

1068
01:49:38,961 --> 01:49:39,761
'PART THREE'

1069
01:49:39,841 --> 01:49:42,561
Me, a colonial boy working
as a tout at a brothel.

1070
01:49:42,721 --> 01:49:45,761
Some Englishmen who frequented
the brothel recognised me.

1071
01:49:45,841 --> 01:49:49,401
I thought they'd call the maître d'
and kick me out,

1072
01:49:49,961 --> 01:49:51,441
but what do you know?

1073
01:49:51,921 --> 01:49:56,081
They were amused I'd spend a month's pay

1074
01:49:56,201 --> 01:49:58,041
on one dignified meal.

1075
01:49:58,561 --> 01:50:00,881
They started calling me 'Count'

1076
01:50:00,961 --> 01:50:02,681
and taught me manners to go with the name.

1077
01:50:02,761 --> 01:50:05,081
Frankly, I'm not that interested
in money itself.

1078
01:50:05,161 --> 01:50:07,961
What I desire is, how shall I put it...

1079
01:50:08,521 --> 01:50:11,161
The manner of ordering wine
without looking at the price?

1080
01:50:11,321 --> 01:50:13,121
Something like that.

1081
01:50:24,001 --> 01:50:26,401
Fourteen hours by train from Vladivostok

1082
01:50:26,481 --> 01:50:29,001
is the summer home of
a genuine Russian noble family.

1083
01:50:30,601 --> 01:50:32,241
Shall we marry there?

1084
01:50:36,521 --> 01:50:38,961
In a few days I'll hear from the hospital.

1085
01:50:40,561 --> 01:50:43,001
That my wife Fujiwara Hideko has died.

1086
01:50:45,081 --> 01:50:49,441
You didn't just ask them to keep her?

1087
01:50:50,361 --> 01:50:53,561
I doubt Sookee would want
to live there very long.

1088
01:51:00,641 --> 01:51:03,161
Fuck!

1089
01:51:08,441 --> 01:51:10,361
I arranged it with a photography studio.

1090
01:51:10,441 --> 01:51:12,921
We'll replace this with your photograph.

1091
01:51:13,321 --> 01:51:17,281
From tomorrow, we'll
give Sookee a new life.

1092
01:51:17,721 --> 01:51:18,881
I'm glad.

1093
01:51:19,001 --> 01:51:20,801
Marry me once again.

1094
01:51:21,641 --> 01:51:23,201
This time as Nam Sookee.

1095
01:51:24,921 --> 01:51:26,881
You want another wedding night?

1096
01:51:33,001 --> 01:51:35,881
I think I like you... slightly.

1097
01:51:39,321 --> 01:51:41,601
Poor Sookee, in a place like that

1098
01:51:42,681 --> 01:51:44,561
all by herself...

1099
01:51:46,641 --> 01:51:49,441
Did such a thought ever cross your mind?

1100
01:51:50,041 --> 01:51:52,281
Not at all. Why should I pity her?

1101
01:51:52,561 --> 01:51:55,401
Where I come from, it's
illegal to be naive.

1102
01:51:55,681 --> 01:51:58,961
Where you come from, it's not naive
to fall in love with a business partner?

1103
01:51:59,081 --> 01:52:01,321
Of course. It's illegal.

1104
01:52:01,601 --> 01:52:04,881
So even if my love for
you leads me to ruin,

1105
01:52:05,321 --> 01:52:06,841
don't pity me.

1106
01:52:07,481 --> 01:52:08,641
Love?

1107
01:52:10,521 --> 01:52:12,561
What does a crook know about love?

1108
01:52:35,361 --> 01:52:36,961
Fire!

1109
01:52:45,801 --> 01:52:48,881
C... c... come this way!

1110
01:52:49,041 --> 01:52:50,441
This way!

1111
01:53:53,841 --> 01:53:56,521
Because you desired me,

1112
01:53:56,601 --> 01:53:58,841
and overcame all obstacles to reach me,

1113
01:53:58,921 --> 01:54:01,161
I have been born anew, it's true.

1114
01:54:02,201 --> 01:54:04,161
I'm grateful for that.

1115
01:54:06,041 --> 01:54:07,961
I'll allow a kiss.

1116
01:54:12,761 --> 01:54:13,841
No.

1117
01:54:13,961 --> 01:54:15,041
Why not?

1118
01:54:18,041 --> 01:54:19,961
I don't like kisses with conditions.

1119
01:54:20,041 --> 01:54:22,641
I never learned how to stop halfway.

1120
01:54:24,681 --> 01:54:30,041
After this I'll thrust
in deep, to your navel.

1121
01:54:30,841 --> 01:54:32,481
Please do that.

1122
01:54:35,881 --> 01:54:37,761
Those aren't the eyes of one who wants it.

1123
01:54:37,921 --> 01:54:40,561
You know you can't deceive
me in such matters.

1124
01:54:45,401 --> 01:54:49,321
If I could be yours for ten minutes,

1125
01:54:49,401 --> 01:54:51,441
what would you give in exchange?

1126
01:54:51,881 --> 01:54:54,121
Whatever your heart desires.

1127
01:54:54,201 --> 01:54:56,961
Anything in this whole wide world.

1128
01:55:20,241 --> 01:55:22,361
There's much I want to teach you.

1129
01:55:23,721 --> 01:55:26,641
You'll become a completely new woman.

1130
01:57:13,481 --> 01:57:16,161
It won't hurt. You know from those books?

1131
01:57:16,241 --> 01:57:19,961
In truth, women feel the greatest pleasure

1132
01:57:20,081 --> 01:57:21,961
when taken by force.

1133
01:57:22,121 --> 01:57:25,121
Now I'm going to rip your underwear.

1134
01:58:57,721 --> 01:59:00,201
Would you fetch those for me?

1135
01:59:42,601 --> 01:59:44,521
"Respected Uncle,

1136
01:59:45,561 --> 01:59:50,241
"it always pained
me to see you straining

1137
01:59:50,361 --> 01:59:54,721
"to speak flawless Japanese
before the Count from Nagoya,

1138
01:59:54,881 --> 01:59:58,161
"and even to quiver
your voice like a nobleman.

1139
02:00:00,161 --> 02:00:06,321
"So I'm happy to inform you that
you no longer need do so.

1140
02:00:07,201 --> 02:00:11,401
"That man is the son
of a Korean farmhand.

1141
02:00:12,321 --> 02:00:16,841
"Oh, did my gift arrive safely?

1142
02:00:17,561 --> 02:00:21,161
"Please tell this
to my gift, in Korean.

1143
02:00:21,921 --> 02:00:24,001
"I'm afraid that in real life,

1144
02:00:24,681 --> 02:00:28,001
"no woman feels pleasure
at being taken by force.

1145
02:00:28,201 --> 02:00:33,481
"But, for sending me Sookee out of
all the girls in the world,

1146
02:00:33,561 --> 02:00:35,881
"I feel "slightly" grateful."

1147
02:00:48,481 --> 02:00:51,841
You wished to see my bookmaking tools?

1148
02:00:52,361 --> 02:00:56,001
Don't just look, experience
them for yourself.

1149
02:00:56,481 --> 02:00:58,601
I'll choose five books that I cherish...

1150
02:00:58,881 --> 02:01:01,681
...that I used to cherish
more than anything.

1151
02:01:03,841 --> 02:01:04,721
Let's see...

1152
02:01:04,761 --> 02:01:06,001
First,

1153
02:01:08,881 --> 02:01:10,641
'Confessions of a Whip'

1154
02:01:19,241 --> 02:01:20,881
'The Lizard Skin'

1155
02:01:32,441 --> 02:01:36,121
'Decadent Girls Who Sell Lingerie'

1156
02:01:45,481 --> 02:01:47,961
May I please smoke a cigarette, sir?

1157
02:01:48,521 --> 02:01:49,961
...Sir.

1158
02:01:52,281 --> 02:01:54,121
'Bells and Balls'

1159
02:01:57,561 --> 02:01:59,681
'The Mortician's Bedroom'

1160
02:02:11,241 --> 02:02:13,681
How could you let a little girl fool you?

1161
02:02:17,001 --> 02:02:21,441
But don't worry. I'll
catch them for you soon.

1162
02:02:23,361 --> 02:02:28,721
I arranged so that no two girls travelling
together can leave Kobe.

1163
02:02:34,641 --> 02:02:36,921
Please change the
destination to Shanghai.

1164
02:02:37,001 --> 02:02:39,961
Changing two tickets,
from Vladivostok to Shanghai.

1165
02:02:40,041 --> 02:02:42,001
Yes, that's correct.

1166
02:02:42,441 --> 02:02:44,321
Show me your passports.

1167
02:02:50,761 --> 02:02:52,961
Miss Nam Sookee?

1168
02:02:55,481 --> 02:02:57,561
Mr. Go Pandol?

1169
02:03:05,001 --> 02:03:07,241
You need to pay an additional 3 yen.

1170
02:03:07,841 --> 02:03:08,921
All right.

1171
02:03:12,441 --> 02:03:16,721
I'm just an old man who
likes dirty stories.

1172
02:03:18,521 --> 02:03:21,961
Even listening to the same story,
people imagine different things.

1173
02:03:22,521 --> 02:03:25,601
Peering into each of those fantasies

1174
02:03:25,801 --> 02:03:29,081
was this old man's humble recreation.

1175
02:03:29,161 --> 02:03:32,321
What to do, now that it's all over?

1176
02:03:32,841 --> 02:03:35,281
You should at least tell me your story.

1177
02:03:36,761 --> 02:03:40,521
How did that bitch Hideko taste?

1178
02:03:41,001 --> 02:03:44,281
Was she fully ripe? Tell me.

1179
02:03:46,601 --> 02:03:49,401
A cigarette might help my memory.

1180
02:03:50,001 --> 02:03:51,841
Right, right...

1181
02:03:53,081 --> 02:03:56,441
You have that silly
penchant for cigarettes?

1182
02:04:15,161 --> 02:04:17,161
So how was Hideko?

1183
02:04:22,521 --> 02:04:26,201
You have no windows here?

1184
02:04:29,841 --> 02:04:33,121
Sookee could be listening in.
Let's do our best.

1185
02:04:44,241 --> 02:04:45,721
That's it, good.

1186
02:04:57,001 --> 02:04:58,481
What's this?

1187
02:04:58,561 --> 02:05:00,961
You can't stop there, dear fellow.

1188
02:05:01,041 --> 02:05:03,281
So, where did you touch first?

1189
02:05:03,761 --> 02:05:05,161
Her face?

1190
02:05:07,161 --> 02:05:08,521
Her breasts?

1191
02:05:10,081 --> 02:05:12,921
Or straight for her c... cunt?

1192
02:05:14,401 --> 02:05:15,961
Was it soft?

1193
02:05:16,601 --> 02:05:18,161
Did it tighten up?

1194
02:05:19,601 --> 02:05:21,721
Did it have many wrinkles?

1195
02:05:22,641 --> 02:05:24,521
Was it sufficiently wet?

1196
02:05:24,601 --> 02:05:27,801
The viscosity and transparency
of her vaginal secretion?

1197
02:05:29,401 --> 02:05:31,281
Please, one more cigarette, sir.

1198
02:05:57,521 --> 02:06:02,921
"Spider thread pulled into strings..."

1199
02:06:04,241 --> 02:06:09,441
I dare say no book has ever described

1200
02:06:09,521 --> 02:06:11,841
such a ferocious wedding night.

1201
02:06:14,161 --> 02:06:17,921
I thought I heard a nightingale sing.

1202
02:06:50,961 --> 02:06:55,721
And... the clear, bright crimson blood!

1203
02:07:04,561 --> 02:07:07,041
Thus the Lady became my wife.

1204
02:07:07,201 --> 02:07:11,281
Coy one moment, bold the next...

1205
02:07:14,521 --> 02:07:19,041
But how was she coy,

1206
02:07:19,161 --> 02:07:23,161
how was she bold, tell it to me in detail!

1207
02:07:23,681 --> 02:07:26,801
A story is all about the journey.

1208
02:07:27,041 --> 02:07:29,241
You should know.

1209
02:07:30,681 --> 02:07:32,561
Did she resist?

1210
02:07:33,241 --> 02:07:35,561
So did you pinch her ass as punishment?

1211
02:07:36,001 --> 02:07:39,761
Or did she spit at you in contempt?

1212
02:07:40,401 --> 02:07:42,081
Or else...

1213
02:07:42,561 --> 02:07:45,041
Did she beg you to do it?

1214
02:07:45,601 --> 02:07:49,241
Like the lady in 'The Widow's Lapdog?'

1215
02:07:52,321 --> 02:07:53,521
How dare you!

1216
02:07:53,841 --> 02:07:55,681
Hideko is my wife.

1217
02:07:56,001 --> 02:08:00,161
What kind of scoundrel rattles on
about his wedding night!

1218
02:09:04,401 --> 02:09:05,881
It's odd..

1219
02:09:07,361 --> 02:09:09,001
Your smoke.

1220
02:09:11,441 --> 02:09:14,641
It's cold, blue...

1221
02:09:16,161 --> 02:09:21,881
and strangely beautiful.

1222
02:09:23,041 --> 02:09:29,841
You too have become soft, slow and dull.

1223
02:09:31,081 --> 02:09:34,361
Mercury is most deadly
in its gaseous state.

1224
02:09:34,881 --> 02:09:37,601
One cigarette would have sufficed.

1225
02:09:40,601 --> 02:09:45,161
At least I will die with my cock intact.

1226
02:13:19,601 --> 02:13:25,241
THE HANDMAIDEN

1227
02:13:35,361 --> 02:13:38,841
"I hear a sound in the distance

1228
02:13:39,561 --> 02:13:42,761
"That sounds like the steps of my love

1229
02:13:44,801 --> 02:13:50,241
"An echo that makes my heart skip a beat

1230
02:13:52,241 --> 02:13:55,801
"But I wait all through the night

1231
02:13:56,041 --> 02:13:59,561
"and my love never comes to me

1232
02:14:00,081 --> 02:14:07,561
"There is no end to the heartache
that grips me in this hour

1233
02:14:08,321 --> 02:14:15,721
"Waiting for the footsteps of my dear love

1234
02:14:16,561 --> 02:14:24,761
"Waiting for the footsteps of my dear love

1235
02:14:41,201 --> 02:14:45,201
"But then in my waiting heart

1236
02:14:45,321 --> 02:14:49,361
"suddenly happiness overflows

1237
02:14:49,441 --> 02:14:53,321
"There you are in the distance

1238
02:14:53,401 --> 02:14:57,001
"coming to me

1239
02:14:57,641 --> 02:15:01,641
"Filled with dreams of a new life

1240
02:15:01,681 --> 02:15:05,721
"filled with happiness

1241
02:15:05,881 --> 02:15:09,721
"Inside my waiting heart

1242
02:15:09,801 --> 02:15:13,601
"flowers start to bloom

02:15:14,121 --> 02:15:18,201
"Come my lover, come to me

1244
02:15:18,241 --> 02:15:22,121
"I missed you so

1245
02:15:22,321 --> 02:15:26,361
"Let's dream of happy times

1246
02:15:26,401 --> 02:15:30,441
"like long ago

02:15:47,001 --> 02:15:50,921
"Filled with dreams of a new life

"Waiting for the footsteps of my dear love

1252
02:16:11,641 --> 02:16:19,961
"Waiting for the footsteps of my dear love"
