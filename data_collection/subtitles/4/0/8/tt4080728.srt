1
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:47,511
No, no, no.
This line starts behind me.

2
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:55,652
- That will be 50 kronor.
- No. It will be 35 kronor.

3
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:59,454
This is only valid if you buy two bouquets.

4
00:00:59,607 --> 00:01:03,037
Sweetie, I only need one bouquet.

5
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:06,210
Half of 70 is still only 35.

6
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,892
One bouquet costs 50 kronor.
Two bouquets together cost 70 kronor.

7
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:12,499
That doesn't make any sense.

8
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:18,561
It's pure madness. I'm reporting this
to the Consumer Ombudsman.

9
00:01:18,797 --> 00:01:22,083
- Is there a manager here?
- No, she's at lunch.

10
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:27,195
Lunch? Learning to count would
be a better pursuit.

11
00:01:36,104 --> 00:01:40,635
Two prices for the same thing?
That's pure madness.

12
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:48,162
But just so you know...

13
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:51,541
Two bouquets won't be a habit.

14
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:58,191
I miss you.

15
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:07,286
A MAN CALLED OVE

16
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:18,311
Good-for-nothings.

17
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:03,502
- The dog should stop peeing at our place.
- Don't listen to the mean old man.

18
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:08,193
Anders! Did you see what the old man did?
He tried to kill Prince.

19
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:09,761
- What did you do to the dog?
- That's no dog.

20
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:12,334
It looks like a pair of winter boots with eyes.

21
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:15,137
- Walking dogs here isn't allowed.
- Don't involve the police.

22
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,637
Can't you say something to him, Anders?
You're Chairman of the Board.

23
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:22,025
- I just did exactly that.
- No, I mean properly.

24
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,249
Good morning.

25
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:46,684
- Everything okay?
- Aren't you chatty?

26
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:53,875
- Ove! Can we have a moment with you?
- In the office.

27
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:58,994
Now you'll be fucking promoted, eh?

28
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:04,025
- Is everything well?
- Yes.

29
00:05:05,177 --> 00:05:08,633
- How long have you worked here, Ove?
- 43 years.

30
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:11,281
- Shit.
- Shit.

31
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:16,585
- You took over your father's job?
- Yes.

32
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:21,788
We have an opportunity for you.

33
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:26,673
You're only 59. You might want to
do something else with your life.

34
00:05:31,117 --> 00:05:33,892
Does 43 years at the same place suggest that?

35
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:36,615
It...

36
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:43,263
- You want to fire me.
- That isn't exactly how I'd express it.

37
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:45,053
But it's close.

38
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:50,849
- We want to offer you a program.
- A kind of government-run training course.

39
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:54,168
- A further step.
- The digital is taking over more and more.

40
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,199
Yeah, then I have a proposal.

41
00:05:57,353 --> 00:06:01,827
Isn't it easier if I just get up and leave?

42
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,800
Good. Then that's what we'll do.

43
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:12,170
Wait, Ove. We have a farewell present.

44
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:15,795
A garden spade.

45
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,993
You need to forward your phone service
there if you're going to travel.

46
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:05,894
- There aren't any phones there.
- You're joking?

47
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,594
Take it easy. Come on.

48
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:34,014
Careful. Hello, hello!

49
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:35,715
[speaking Persian]

50
00:08:38,468 --> 00:08:41,233
Stop. Stop! Stop!

51
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:44,766
- Oh dear.
- What the fuck?

52
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,372
- Drive forward a little. Patrick!
- What are you doing?

53
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:53,982
- He's not very smart.
- Driving here isn't permitted.

54
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:58,820
- Can't you read Swedish signs?
- Are you blind? Am I the one driving?

55
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,166
Nice to meet you. Patrick.

56
00:09:01,646 --> 00:09:05,271
You should be called Mickey Mouse,
but if you're backing up  -

57
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:08,712
- turn the opposite direction and
look in the rear-view mirror.

58
00:09:10,505 --> 00:09:13,731
- What's she saying?
- No idea. It's Persian.

59
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:16,035
Isn't it beautiful?

60
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:20,028
No...no, hello!

61
00:09:20,182 --> 00:09:22,601
- No, no!
- Did I hit something?

62
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:26,557
Out, now! Stand someplace
where you aren't in the way.

63
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:32,048
- Remember ...
- Thanks. I can drive a car.

64
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,606
- What is that, now?
- The backup camera.

65
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:44,368
Camera? What fucking cam...

66
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:46,908
- Hi.
- Hey, you.

67
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:56,373
Mom!

68
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,941
Backup cameras? You shouldn't
even have a cassette tape.

69
00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:37,073
- Petter!
- Idiots.

70
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:39,492
Fuck, I can't find my jacket.

71
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:43,064
- Petter! Petter!
- Yeah.

72
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:48,171
- Come here! Petter!
- What do you want?

73
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:00,321
PARKING ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN!

74
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,451
Scram!

75
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:49,700
You took my bike.
Can I get it back?

76
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,924
- Wasn't it a woman's bike?
- It's my girlfriend's.

77
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:56,919
- And where does she live?
- 142 over there.

78
00:11:57,073 --> 00:11:59,915
With the communists who
introduced waste sorting?

79
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:03,640
- Then she can get it herself.
- Whatever.

80
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:06,596
- Should I let him take my bike?
- He's weird.

81
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:15,300
Hey, Ove. Everything okay?

82
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,215
Why does everyone ask if it's okay?
Why wouldn't it be okay?

83
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:25,054
You're not working. It's the middle
of the day and you've never been sick.

84
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:28,702
Do you want something?
Or do you like talking your life away?

85
00:12:28,855 --> 00:12:31,928
Do you want come get some lunch?

86
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:33,694
Idiots!

87
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:41,989
Bloody maniacs!
Driving here is not permitted!

88
00:12:43,985 --> 00:12:49,225
- Did you say something, or?
- Yeah, driving here is forbidden.

89
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:54,160
- Oh yeah? Well, I have permission.
- The hell you do.

90
00:12:54,313 --> 00:12:57,424
- Goodbye. - Drive!
- Get away from here!

91
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,247
Is something wrong?

92
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,615
If you have visitors, there's guest parking.

93
00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:19,609
That's what we decided.

94
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:23,449
They were from the municipality.
They were bringing Rune home.

95
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,709
We've been getting so cold inside.
Can you take a look?

96
00:13:29,862 --> 00:13:32,320
No. Put on another blanket.

97
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:42,726
Sorry I didn't come yesterday
like I was supposed to.

98
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,249
I just couldn't. It's been a real circus at home.

99
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:51,997
New neighbors moved in across the way.

100
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:56,975
You'd be shocked how people are these
days. No one can do anything anymore.

101
00:13:56,987 --> 00:13:59,982
They can't back up with a trailer,
or change a tire.

102
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:04,513
When you ask them the simplest thing
in the world, they're eating lunch.

103
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:11,044
Think about it. Soon we'll have a country
where everyone is busy eating lunch.

104
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,551
You're lucky you don't have to be a part of it.

105
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,664
A white car showed up in the area.
Complete maniacs.

106
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:28,346
There's no order when you aren't home.

107
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:40,414
If I hurry now, maybe we can even
see each other today.

108
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:48,152
I miss you.

109
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:40,376
What the fuck now.

110
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:52,396
Yeah? What's the matter?

111
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,583
- We have rice and chicken.
- Are you selling rice?

112
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:58,847
It's just a little food to thank you for your help.

113
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:05,326
Persian food with saffron. Damn good.
Parvaneh is insanely good at cooking -

114
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:06,681
- and I am insanely good at...

115
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:14,456
The trailer is gone. I saw the note.
Totally right, it was our fault.

116
00:16:15,455 --> 00:16:18,258
- We thought you might be little hungry.
- No, I'm not hungry.

117
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,599
- Then we'll throw it out.
- No, nothing is thrown out here.

118
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:25,938
- We thought we heard you have a ladder.
- Of course I have a ladder.

119
00:16:26,092 --> 00:16:29,740
Everyone should have a ladder here.
It's in the bylaws, in fact.

120
00:16:29,893 --> 00:16:32,198
If you are familiar with them.

121
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:39,405
Then maybe could we...borrow it?

122
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,874
It feels safe with a guy who's always home.

123
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:47,647
Here are the supports.

124
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:49,990
And the instruction manual.

125
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,409
So... Fuck!

126
00:16:52,563 --> 00:16:56,095
- Do you have an 'insect' key?
- Hex key.

127
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,246
No, 'insect' key.

128
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,785
What does it have to do with insects?
Six sides - hex key.

129
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:05,026
Google it.

130
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:12,748
Ove? Can you look at the heating now?

131
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:16,929
- If I ask nicely?
- Try to bleed the radiator.

132
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:20,078
- Could that be it?
- Hi. I'm Parvaneh.

133
00:17:20,231 --> 00:17:23,803
- This is my husband Patrick.
- Always nice to meet new neighbors.

134
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:29,726
God, how nice it is here.
It's paradise for the kids.

135
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:34,253
Goddammit. Does no one have a job anymore?

136
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:37,755
- Aren't you going to 'lift' her radiator?
- Bleed.

137
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:42,506
One doesn't lift radiators.
One bleeds them.

138
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,581
Maybe Rune should have asked me
about the heating before the coup d'état.

139
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:50,999
- Please, Ove, it wasn't a coup d'état.
- A coup was what it was!

140
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,802
- Do you want the supports, or what?
- Yeah, yeah.

141
00:17:56,721 --> 00:18:00,868
Ove was Chairman of the Board, then
everyone voted for my husband Rune.

142
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:03,633
Parvaneh! Check it out.
They're damn nice ...

143
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:05,976
Don't take them. They were for Sonja.

144
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:10,392
- The thing is that she was in...
- Now shut your mouth! Quiet!

145
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:14,117
Now that's enough!
Get out of here, everybody! Go home!

146
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:16,613
Get out of here!

147
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:26,440
Paradise, huh?

148
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:09,928
Ove?

149
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:18,928
Ove? Can you come look at something?

150
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:21,295
Yeah. Should I come there?

151
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:29,906
Ove?

152
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:35,321
- How nice the bookshelf is.
- Yeah.

153
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,971
How many books do you have?

154
00:19:38,124 --> 00:19:42,828
It's these here and the box in the kitchen,
and then the ones in the storeroom.

155
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,979
I'll build another.

156
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:12,340
They say the brain works faster as it dies.

157
00:20:12,493 --> 00:20:17,025
As if the impressions of the outside world
become slow-motion.

158
00:20:17,178 --> 00:20:21,825
I had time to think about a good deal.
Mostly about the radiator, actually.

159
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,680
And about Mom.
She died early.

160
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:44,354
Dad wasn't one of those people
who showed sadness.

161
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:47,003
- Thanks for coming.
- I didn't, either.

162
00:20:47,157 --> 00:20:49,115
It is what it is.

163
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:53,877
One thing is for sure.

164
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:58,577
Whatever we do in this life,
we will not live past it.

165
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,703
Come on, Ove, we're going home.

166
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:08,229
Dad didn't say much.
He mostly cared about the house.

167
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:10,149
And cars.

168
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:14,356
Clearly they didn't say much either.

169
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:17,551
Cars can give you freedom.

170
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:22,977
But if you act like an asshole with them,
they'll take it from you right away.

171
00:21:23,668 --> 00:21:25,896
But that night, he talked.

172
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:31,041
Ove? I want you to know how
everything is connected.

173
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:35,957
- Uh. In a Saab 92.
- Yeah.

174
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:41,320
- And what do the spark plugs do?
- They make the car go.

175
00:21:42,024 --> 00:21:43,714
Exactly.

176
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:56,417
This, Ove ... This is the life!

177
00:21:57,991 --> 00:22:01,562
They're never going to make
a better car than Saab.

178
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,963
But for the most part, he said nothing at all.

179
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:26,580
After school, I went to Dad's job.

180
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,884
- Hey, Dad!
- Hey, Ove!

181
00:22:29,037 --> 00:22:31,457
He said it was safest.

182
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,300
Get off the track, Ove!

183
00:22:33,454 --> 00:22:36,910
- Get off the track, Ove!
- What are you saying?

184
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:39,175
Behind you!

185
00:22:46,284 --> 00:22:49,779
It was probably the first time in my life
that my father hugged me.

186
00:22:49,932 --> 00:22:54,233
I don't know why, but for some
strange reason I thought of Mom.

187
00:22:54,387 --> 00:22:56,384
You have to be more careful.

188
00:22:56,537 --> 00:22:58,995
He probably did, too.

189
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:06,867
Then I got the opportunity.

190
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:15,930
There. Ove, it's okay now.
Now let Dad go.

191
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:25,564
Everyone said that he was too nice.
How can one be too nice?

192
00:23:48,463 --> 00:23:52,342
I got to know my father's fine colleagues.

193
00:23:53,762 --> 00:23:56,489
- Tom was one of them.
- Give it back.

194
00:23:56,642 --> 00:24:00,690
- No. I found it.
- You're going to get such a beating...

195
00:24:00,813 --> 00:24:04,077
Sometimes one doesn't know if what
one is doing is the right thing.

196
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:07,917
- It's just a feeling one gets.
- You fucking little brat.

197
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:13,397
Sometimes feelings can be associated
in a strange way with direct pain.

198
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:20,896
We find what we keep.
That's how it's always been. Always.

199
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,932
Ove?

200
00:24:23,085 --> 00:24:27,885
Do whatever you want with the purse.
It was you who found it.

201
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:34,653
- I found it on the train.
- Thank you so much.

202
00:24:37,994 --> 00:24:43,565
- Why didn't you tell on Tom?
- We don't talk about what others do.

203
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,711
- I thought about keeping the purse.
- Yeah, I know.

204
00:24:46,864 --> 00:24:49,744
But in the end you gave it back.

205
00:24:49,898 --> 00:24:52,834
Honesty is the best thing, Ove.

206
00:24:53,047 --> 00:24:59,621
But sometimes honesty needs a little help.

207
00:25:04,651 --> 00:25:07,953
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, very well. I understand.

208
00:25:12,984 --> 00:25:18,197
Come on, let's go home.
Hop on.

209
00:25:18,147 --> 00:25:23,139
Finally the day came when
I got to know real freedom.

210
00:25:28,476 --> 00:25:31,919
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Ove.

211
00:25:33,277 --> 00:25:39,538
- How did it go?
- Yeah, you...see for yourself.

212
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:57,762
It was damn good. Did you see?

213
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:07,977
Guys?

214
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:12,585
Have you seen Ove's marks?
He's going to be our next foreman!

215
00:26:26,524 --> 00:26:29,942
What? Fives and fours.
Fantastic.

216
00:26:36,731 --> 00:26:40,774
Call the foreman!
Call the foreman, for fuck's sake!

217
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:46,939
Dad!

218
00:26:59,688 --> 00:27:01,493
What the hell?

219
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,602
What's this fucking garbage you're selling?

220
00:27:05,756 --> 00:27:09,448
Universal rope, you said.
"Holds everything".

221
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:14,687
What did you use it for?

222
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,415
Ugh!

223
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:19,448
Idiot.

224
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:25,132
It's impossible to get a
proper rope anymore.

225
00:27:41,306 --> 00:27:46,702
The new neighbors keep making a mess.
Eating rice with saffron.

226
00:27:47,143 --> 00:27:49,870
What's wrong with meat and potatoes?

227
00:27:50,023 --> 00:27:53,787
One doesn't need to pour
fancy things in the food!

228
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:04,838
This must be the first time
you've had to wait for me.

229
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:21,846
- Hey! What are you doing?
- It scratched Prince.

230
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:27,744
Throw another stone and I'll
sew a doormat with your mop!

231
00:28:28,224 --> 00:28:32,179
It's a chihuahua. And the cat
surely has both rabies and the plague.

232
00:28:32,332 --> 00:28:36,019
Clearly you do, too.
But we don't throw stones at you.

233
00:28:37,363 --> 00:28:40,781
You still think that you can do
what you want? Slimy fucking old man.

234
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:43,315
- I'm going to tell Anders.
- Well, go ahead.

235
00:28:43,469 --> 00:28:46,925
If you can make someone who
drives an Audi understand.

236
00:28:47,078 --> 00:28:50,189
Four zeros on the grill and
a fifth at the wheel.

237
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:59,203
If it pisses on our fences again,
I'll electrify them!

238
00:29:00,212 --> 00:29:04,067
Idiot. Yeah, that applies to you, too.

239
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,749
Scram! This is private property.

240
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:38,165
August 27th, you borrowed my hose.
I need it now.

241
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,348
- Are you going to water in March?
- You watered, now I'm watering.

242
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:47,919
Can't you look at the radiator
now that you're here?

243
00:29:49,882 --> 00:29:53,953
Thanks. That was really nice.
I have food on the stove. Want some?

244
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:59,704
- Thanks, I've eaten.
- I see. I'll just get the hose.

245
00:30:05,627 --> 00:30:09,839
Rune? Rune?

246
00:30:19,457 --> 00:30:24,410
Just so you know, people do whatever
the fuck they want in the association.

247
00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:29,556
Everything you and I built is going to ruin.

248
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:35,584
To hell with it. I don't care.

249
00:30:37,725 --> 00:30:41,412
In fact, I'm thinking of leaving here. For good.

250
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:49,686
I'm going to Sonja.
I thought you'd be glad to know.

251
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:55,005
You can't do anything about it.
Just sit and watch as everything...

252
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:57,118
The food is almost ready.

253
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:02,474
Thanks for loaning it.
It was really nice of you.

254
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,011
- You don't want a little food?
- No.

255
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:08,467
- Jimmy's eating, too.
- Stuffed cabbage, Ove. Damn good.

256
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:13,075
- Rune would certainly appreciate it.
- He neither hears nor understands a thing.

257
00:31:13,229 --> 00:31:16,416
Rune understands a lot more than people think.

258
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:20,986
It's as if he knows exactly
what's going on in our heads.

259
00:31:24,864 --> 00:31:26,899
Yeah, I have to go now.

260
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:30,970
Let go of the hose.

261
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,927
Let go of the hose!

262
00:31:44,552 --> 00:31:47,701
Hey, Ove!
We're trying to put up a window.

263
00:31:47,855 --> 00:31:52,406
- From outside? Good luck!
- You're holding the ladder, right?

264
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:04,032
You should be holding the ladder.
Where are you going now?

265
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,329
THANKS, IT WAS GOOD
OVE

266
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:16,164
One can count on a Saab, at least.

267
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:44,613
The Director will see you now.

268
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,874
What a pity this was.

269
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:56,047
If we can help you with
anything, just say so.

270
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,345
They were fine grades.

271
00:33:59,499 --> 00:34:03,185
It's yours. That's half of Dad's salary
up to the end of the month.

272
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:07,229
He always paid in advance.

273
00:34:07,486 --> 00:34:11,173
- We can't take the money back.
- What's right is right.

274
00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:14,975
Maybe we can find another solution.

275
00:34:18,177 --> 00:34:24,091
I knew how it was done, and
I knew all of Dad's colleagues.

276
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:27,628
What are you going to do now
that Dad is in heaven?

277
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:35,189
No, not that. Not that.

278
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:36,840
Not that.

279
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:41,653
There comes a time when one must decide -

280
00:34:41,806 --> 00:34:43,573
- who one wants to be.

281
00:34:43,726 --> 00:34:46,798
Now we're even for the purse,
you little shit.

282
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:49,026
For me, it was exactly then.

283
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,288
The watch is mine!

284
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:15,942
- Are you Ove Lindahl?
- Yes.

285
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:18,649
- We've been looking for you.
- Oh yeah?

286
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:23,167
We're going to take a look at your house.

287
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:26,162
There's a new zoning plan for the area.

288
00:35:26,316 --> 00:35:30,386
The house isn't appropriate for
future building plans.

289
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,760
No, Stig, we'll clear everything.

290
00:35:34,418 --> 00:35:37,145
You see yourself.
It's a tear-down.

291
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,228
It was the first time I met them,
but not the last.

292
00:35:41,382 --> 00:35:44,646
They never told me their names,
just where they were from.

293
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:48,116
The men in the white shirts.

294
00:35:50,729 --> 00:35:53,264
And they always got what they wanted.

295
00:35:54,877 --> 00:35:58,179
- Ove? Fika break.
- Finally, it was finished.

296
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:01,328
And it wasn't so bad if I say so myself.

297
00:36:01,482 --> 00:36:05,514
But the men in the white shirts didn't like it.

298
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:08,893
Hi.

299
00:36:10,656 --> 00:36:15,188
Some people say that fate is
the result of our own stupidity -

300
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:18,567
- so one can probably say that
what changed my fate -

301
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:22,177
- was the result of my neighbors' stupidity.

302
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:35,795
Is anyone in the house?
Is anyone in the house?

303
00:36:36,275 --> 00:36:37,811
Help!

304
00:36:38,141 --> 00:36:40,368
Hello? Hello?!

305
00:36:40,522 --> 00:36:42,173
Help!

306
00:37:23,649 --> 00:37:25,761
- Disconnect the fire hose!
- I'm going in!

307
00:37:25,915 --> 00:37:28,910
I tried to reason with the firemen.

308
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:30,868
But then he showed up again.

309
00:37:31,022 --> 00:37:34,593
Turn off the water. Turn off the water!
It's going to be demolished anyway.

310
00:37:34,747 --> 00:37:37,646
Stop extinguishing!

311
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:39,240
The white shirt.

312
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,029
How long have we been going?

313
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:02,063
- About an hour.
- Damn!

314
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:05,365
I could have woken you if
I knew you were getting off.

315
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,513
You were so cute when you slept.
Did you oversleep?

316
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:12,431
No. It's no problem.

317
00:39:13,122 --> 00:39:15,427
Tickets.

318
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:25,578
- Thank you.
- I don't have a ticket.

319
00:39:25,671 --> 00:39:27,629
Then you have to buy a ticket.

320
00:39:28,474 --> 00:39:33,238
- I'm sorry, I have no money, either.
- I've got it.

321
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:35,617
There.

322
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:44,206
- I'll pay you back, of course.
- That's alright.

323
00:39:47,816 --> 00:39:50,465
I'm reading The Master and Margarita.

324
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:52,501
- Do you know it?
- No.

325
00:39:52,654 --> 00:39:56,791
There's a cat in the book
who also doesn't pay his fare.

326
00:39:57,646 --> 00:40:01,092
Have you read any Mikhail Bulgakov?

327
00:40:01,471 --> 00:40:05,196
- No, I haven't read any of he.
- Of him.

328
00:40:07,577 --> 00:40:11,557
- Mmhmm.
- I'm studying to be a teacher.

329
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:13,470
I'm getting off here.

330
00:40:17,887 --> 00:40:21,060
Wait! You forgot this.

331
00:40:53,697 --> 00:40:57,806
After that day, I got up every morning
and took the 7:30 train.

332
00:41:00,456 --> 00:41:02,990
But she'd completely disappeared.

333
00:41:07,357 --> 00:41:10,237
After three weeks, I was about to give up.

334
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:24,752
- Hey.
- Hey.

335
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:35,138
- Do you usually take this train?
- Yeah.

336
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:39,296
I'm in the army.

337
00:41:39,776 --> 00:41:42,771
In...the regiment.

338
00:41:43,654 --> 00:41:45,190
Mmhmm.

339
00:41:45,344 --> 00:41:51,850
Oh! I thought you should
get your money back.

340
00:41:54,524 --> 00:41:58,095
Wouldn't it be nicer to ask me to dinner?

341
00:41:59,554 --> 00:42:01,628
Dinner? Sure.

342
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:09,462
I don't really have anywhere to cook dinner.

343
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:12,649
I meant at a restaurant.

344
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,449
Oh. Okay. Mmhmm.

345
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:23,637
- If you usually go to restaurants.
- Yeah.

346
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:27,477
- Then that's that.
- Absolutely.

347
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:01,550
Hey! Hello.

348
00:43:01,703 --> 00:43:05,785
- You're fifteen minutes late.
- Oh yeah? Am I?

349
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,148
So...

350
00:43:45,794 --> 00:43:49,404
- Do you know anything about cars?
- About cars?

351
00:43:49,557 --> 00:43:55,655
It's maybe a bit interesting to know
how they run.

352
00:43:56,751 --> 00:44:00,284
- It's not as simple as one thinks.
- Uhhuh.

353
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:05,506
Think of a car. A Saab 93, perhaps.

354
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:10,575
It needs a power source, an engine.
And Saab uses piston engines.

355
00:44:10,729 --> 00:44:14,185
And the piston drives a crankshaft.

356
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:18,809
The clever thing about Saabs
is that they're front-wheel drive.

357
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,977
So it doesn't need a propeller shaft.

358
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:26,240
- Dad was also into cars.
- Mm.

359
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:38,643
- You've eaten next to nothing.
- No, I ate at home.

360
00:44:39,834 --> 00:44:44,214
Mmhmm. Why did you eat at home?

361
00:44:49,723 --> 00:44:53,525
So that you could order what you wanted.

362
00:44:54,408 --> 00:44:58,709
I lied to you.
I'm not in the army.

363
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:02,729
I clean trains.
And my house burned down.

364
00:45:03,202 --> 00:45:05,698
And I'm going to go now.

365
00:45:07,123 --> 00:45:09,465
Thanks, it was nice.

366
00:45:22,647 --> 00:45:25,642
She asked what I was interested in.

367
00:45:25,796 --> 00:45:29,982
I answered, "houses", because it was
the only thing that came to mind.

368
00:45:30,135 --> 00:45:32,670
Then she told me about a training course.

369
00:45:32,823 --> 00:45:36,623
Two years later, I was an educated engineer.

370
00:45:38,084 --> 00:45:40,388
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

371
00:45:42,718 --> 00:45:45,330
Oh, how nice.

372
00:45:48,555 --> 00:45:52,511
Well...let's see what's on your diploma.

373
00:45:52,664 --> 00:45:55,237
- "Ove Lind..."
- Will you marry me?

374
00:45:55,391 --> 00:45:59,039
I thought that if you'd like to, we...

375
00:46:01,112 --> 00:46:03,685
Speak calmly and clearly.

376
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:10,213
- Will you marry me?
- Yes!

377
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,364
Yes, I will!

378
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:34,152
Yeah, yeah!

379
00:46:36,686 --> 00:46:39,950
Ow! Ow! Goddammit! Shit!

380
00:46:40,104 --> 00:46:43,521
- What are you doing?
- What are YOU doing?

381
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:48,592
- You have to drive me to the hospital now.
- For a little nosebleed?

382
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,607
Patrick fell off the ladder.

383
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,832
I could have figured that out, the ass.

384
00:46:56,368 --> 00:47:00,477
Drive yourself. Take the little Japanese
sewing machine you came in the other day.

385
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:02,282
I don't have a driver's license.

386
00:47:02,436 --> 00:47:04,586
- How old are you?
- 30.

387
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,657
- 30 years old and no driver's license?
- Patrick went in an ambulance and may die.

388
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,614
- But I can take the bus. Thanks!
- I'll drive, then.

389
00:47:11,767 --> 00:47:14,110
Great. At last. Was that so hard?

390
00:47:14,263 --> 00:47:16,951
- Where are you going now?
- To get the kids.

391
00:47:21,022 --> 00:47:26,727
- It smells disgusting.
- Mom, I can't breathe.

392
00:47:27,292 --> 00:47:30,479
- Roll down the windows, then.
- No, not the windows.

393
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:33,935
Roll them up. Roll up the windows.

394
00:47:35,241 --> 00:47:38,505
- Stop!
- Can you go a little faster?

395
00:47:39,734 --> 00:47:43,420
Please, Ove, no one is going to
ticket you at a hospital.

396
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,683
It's only going to take fifteen minutes.

397
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:54,340
He's in for observation.
I'm going in, so we'll meet here later, OK?

398
00:47:54,494 --> 00:47:58,636
- Wait a second. What about the children?
- They'll have to stay with you.

399
00:47:58,718 --> 00:48:00,753
[speaking Persian]

400
00:48:00,907 --> 00:48:02,597
Hey!

401
00:48:08,415 --> 00:48:10,796
- Book.
- Yeah, I see that.

402
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:13,907
- Book.
- She wants you to read it.

403
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:30,872
"Herr Brum has just started to do
what he does every Tuesday."

404
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:34,912
"When you grow up, you're going
to be a train driver, Guld-Ivar exclaims."

405
00:48:35,328 --> 00:48:39,321
- Book isn't that fun.
- No, I don't like it either.

406
00:48:39,475 --> 00:48:43,546
You have to speak with a story voice,
and sound like a talking bear.

407
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:47,117
- There aren't any talking bears.
- This one does.

408
00:48:56,602 --> 00:49:02,251
"I've already been a train driver for
a long time, says Herr Brum."

409
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,689
Yeah! Exactly like that, very good!

410
00:49:04,843 --> 00:49:07,531
"Herr Brum presses a red button."

411
00:49:13,329 --> 00:49:16,593
- "Hundreds of Frantic Honeybees"...
- Hey, kids!

412
00:49:16,747 --> 00:49:21,163
- Look, a clown!
- Beppo the Clown is here! Hey!

413
00:49:21,317 --> 00:49:26,467
- Do you want to see a magic trick?
- I was reading a story to the children.

414
00:49:26,947 --> 00:49:30,211
He was reading a story to the children...
But now I'm here.

415
00:49:30,365 --> 00:49:35,050
Do you have a five kronor coin?
I need five kronor for my trick.

416
00:49:35,203 --> 00:49:38,160
Give him a five.

417
00:49:41,885 --> 00:49:45,265
Thanks. Now the show begins!

418
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:49,450
[speaking Persian]

419
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:54,958
Can you tell me where you live?

420
00:49:55,918 --> 00:49:59,144
- How can you just leave my children?
- I didn't leave your children.

421
00:49:59,297 --> 00:50:04,038
These untalented, pretend
policemen forced me.

422
00:50:04,518 --> 00:50:07,859
We decided that your father was a security risk.

423
00:50:08,012 --> 00:50:10,931
I just wanted my five kronor back!

424
00:50:14,732 --> 00:50:16,537
Ta-da!

425
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:18,803
Beppo the Clown thanks you.

426
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:27,098
Hey, wait! This isn't the
five kronor coin that I gave you.

427
00:50:27,251 --> 00:50:30,477
- Poor baby.
- I want my five kronor.

428
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:35,776
Are you a total idiot?

429
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:38,482
Hey! What are you doing over there?

430
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:45,183
It's not my fault he had long shoes.
It's not even funny, just impractical.

431
00:50:45,894 --> 00:50:50,848
- Fuck! This is insane!
- Uhhuh. What did I say?

432
00:50:51,308 --> 00:50:55,382
- I'll take it. It's my fine.
- It's my car.

433
00:50:59,038 --> 00:51:02,456
- Bye, Ove.
- Bye, Ove!

434
00:51:40,717 --> 00:51:45,095
Intercity 3214 is passing on track 3.

435
00:52:16,374 --> 00:52:18,882
Come help, for fuck's sake!

436
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:26,051
Are you stupid?
Give me your hand.

437
00:52:26,696 --> 00:52:31,395
Give me your hand now!
Come on, dammit! Are you an idiot?

438
00:52:32,512 --> 00:52:34,432
Dad!

439
00:52:42,343 --> 00:52:45,684
What is it with you?
Do you want to fucking die or something?

440
00:52:46,459 --> 00:52:49,147
- You saved he.
- Him.

441
00:52:49,301 --> 00:52:52,104
"Saved him" is how you say it.

442
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:56,828
Idiot.

443
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,200
Ove!

444
00:53:03,522 --> 00:53:08,117
Nasanin made a drawing for you.
Wait there. Wait there.

445
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:13,468
Here.
Nasanin made a drawing for you.

446
00:53:13,621 --> 00:53:18,049
The one in color is you.
She always draws you in color.

447
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,847
- Always?
- I have the world's best idea.

448
00:53:21,001 --> 00:53:25,187
You and I should practice driving.
Patrick sure can't, and you're a lot better.

449
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:28,144
- No, I don't have time.
- I'll pay for fuel, of course.

450
00:53:28,297 --> 00:53:31,677
Isn't it a good idea?
...What was that?

451
00:53:40,058 --> 00:53:42,784
Oh god, poor little thing!

452
00:53:44,742 --> 00:53:47,584
There. Ow, ow, ow.

453
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,383
- Open the door.
- Not in my house.

454
00:53:53,536 --> 00:53:55,648
Open the door now!

455
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,892
God, it's freezing in here.
Grab a blanket.

456
00:54:05,046 --> 00:54:07,811
- Why?
- Quickly. Now!

457
00:54:50,714 --> 00:54:54,055
Hey, man.
I was outside and heard someone shout.

458
00:54:54,209 --> 00:54:56,705
No, I know something faster. Wait.

459
00:54:57,863 --> 00:55:00,666
They say fat people generate a ton of heat.

460
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:04,621
- I'll get something to dry with.
- No, not in the kitchen!

461
00:55:04,775 --> 00:55:07,693
What is this? Shit, it's so low.

462
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:12,839
- It's for Sonja. My wife.
- Where is she now?

463
00:55:12,993 --> 00:55:16,098
She's...dead.

464
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:22,162
She cooked like the devil.
I ate here all the time. Right, Ove?

465
00:55:23,891 --> 00:55:27,577
I think she's doing a little better now.
Who's going to take her?

466
00:55:27,731 --> 00:55:30,419
I can't. My children are really allergic.

467
00:55:30,877 --> 00:55:34,511
Oh, fuck, I forgot. I'm allergic, too.

468
00:55:43,595 --> 00:55:47,243
It's not as easy to kill oneself as one thinks.

469
00:55:47,397 --> 00:55:52,312
But she moved in, too.
I have to get rid of her.

470
00:55:53,234 --> 00:55:56,630
But I'll come back later.
I promise, Sonja.

471
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:02,112
She looked like this from the start.
Don't think I had anything to do with it.

472
00:56:02,573 --> 00:56:04,800
See you soon, then.

473
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,798
I thought you didn't like children.

474
00:56:31,952 --> 00:56:37,673
Of course I like children, but I just
don't know if I'd be a good father.

475
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,616
Ove, you'd be the best father
our children could have.

476
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,139
I promise.

477
00:57:08,692 --> 00:57:11,226
Idiot!

478
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:15,758
Sorry, Ove! Did I hit you?
I'm practicing with Anders now.

479
00:57:15,911 --> 00:57:20,427
- Hey, Ove.
- Is that dandy going to teach you to drive?

480
00:57:20,796 --> 00:57:24,521
- You didn't want to drive with me.
- We should probably have seatbelts on.

481
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:28,169
- Right.
- Ah, let me just...

482
00:57:29,014 --> 00:57:31,087
- Sorry.
- Bye!

483
00:58:09,212 --> 00:58:11,516
- Weeee!
- Hey, hey, hey.

484
00:58:11,669 --> 00:58:16,124
Be careful. Please, be careful with Dad's leg.

485
00:58:19,256 --> 00:58:21,023
How did it go?

486
00:58:25,017 --> 00:58:28,165
- I'll take her if you get the door.
- Sit here.

487
00:58:32,966 --> 00:58:38,918
Do you have the green sign? One needs
it on the back when practicing driving.

488
00:58:39,071 --> 00:58:43,628
I can't watch an idiot teach
another idiot to drive.

489
00:58:44,409 --> 00:58:45,945
Cool. Thanks!

490
00:58:47,417 --> 00:58:51,487
- Hey, Ove. Everything okay?
- Learn to read the instructions.

491
00:58:57,094 --> 00:59:01,446
Hey! What lovely weather for driving practice.

492
00:59:02,307 --> 00:59:07,447
Here's some Persian cookies.
I bake about as good as I drive.

493
00:59:10,025 --> 00:59:12,099
Sit.

494
00:59:18,252 --> 00:59:20,325
Stop. It's red.

495
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:22,783
I'm useless.

496
00:59:25,855 --> 00:59:29,876
Now it's green. You can drive now.
Don't forget the clutch.

497
00:59:30,356 --> 00:59:33,236
God, he's stressing me out!

498
00:59:33,389 --> 00:59:36,529
Start it again. Let go of the key.

499
00:59:37,009 --> 00:59:39,582
Clutch up and gas down.

500
00:59:39,735 --> 00:59:42,615
- That's what I'm doing!
- Leave the clutch...

501
00:59:44,804 --> 00:59:46,878
I can't do it!

502
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:50,987
No, you bastard!

503
00:59:54,904 --> 00:59:58,091
Have you never been a beginner?
Don't you see the sign?

504
00:59:58,244 --> 01:00:01,201
- Take it easy, little old man.
- "Little old man"!

505
01:00:01,355 --> 01:00:04,849
I'm no fucking "little old man" to you,
you fucking bastard.

506
01:00:05,003 --> 01:00:06,846
I'm "big old man".

507
01:00:07,883 --> 01:00:13,106
Honk one more time and it'll be
the last thing you do. Got it?

508
01:00:25,715 --> 01:00:28,863
Now you listen to me.
You've had two children -

509
01:00:29,017 --> 01:00:31,321
- and you're about to spit out a third.

510
01:00:31,475 --> 01:00:35,123
You came here from Iran,
fleeing war and whatever the hell else.

511
01:00:35,276 --> 01:00:38,848
You learned a new language, got
an education and a livelihood.

512
01:00:39,001 --> 01:00:44,176
And you're married to a good-for-nothing.
You can fucking learn to drive, too.

513
01:00:44,656 --> 01:00:47,421
It's not brain surgery.

514
01:00:47,574 --> 01:00:50,531
Start the car now, then just drive.

515
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:55,792
Idiot.

516
01:00:57,482 --> 01:00:59,171
Good.

517
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:09,309
No, no, no. I already got it.

518
01:01:11,153 --> 01:01:13,380
No, no, no. Over here.

519
01:01:28,201 --> 01:01:31,855
This was Sonja's favorite bakery.

520
01:01:33,615 --> 01:01:38,797
Every Thursday at 1:00 we sat here.
Right at this table.

521
01:01:39,277 --> 01:01:41,581
And ate napoleon pastries?

522
01:01:44,346 --> 01:01:47,802
- How did you know that?
- It's Thursday, 1:00.

523
01:01:55,252 --> 01:01:57,441
What did you do after?

524
01:01:59,284 --> 01:02:01,473
At 2:00 we went home.

525
01:02:02,382 --> 01:02:06,683
Sonja usually read some books,
and Rune and I usually washed the car.

526
01:02:06,837 --> 01:02:10,446
It had to be hand-washed.
No machines scratching the paint.

527
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,098
Rune?

528
01:02:15,592 --> 01:02:20,189
- You don't even talk to each other.
- We did at the time.

529
01:02:27,859 --> 01:02:31,371
Actually, we were probably quite similar.

530
01:02:36,346 --> 01:02:39,149
Stop! Stop, I said!

531
01:02:42,144 --> 01:02:43,910
- Rune.
- Ove.

532
01:02:44,064 --> 01:02:47,981
- We worked together.
- I'll take a shortcut across the field.

533
01:02:49,363 --> 01:02:52,512
- You don't do that.
- You can tell your friends that, too.

534
01:02:52,665 --> 01:02:54,931
We shared the same values.

535
01:02:55,085 --> 01:02:58,656
At the association's first meeting,
I was chosen as Chairman of the Board -

536
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:03,423
- and Rune as Vice Chairman.
A wise choice, we thought.

537
01:03:03,917 --> 01:03:08,871
We were both probably surprised
to have found a friend.

538
01:03:09,024 --> 01:03:13,786
Until we finally discovered
that little difference between us.

539
01:03:14,266 --> 01:03:18,661
- You drive a Volvo?
- Yeah.

540
01:03:19,873 --> 01:03:22,599
What do you drive?

541
01:03:22,753 --> 01:03:24,634
Saab.

542
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:32,141
At first, we tried to ignore
the problem and hang out as usual.

543
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,906
We handled it nicely.

544
01:03:35,059 --> 01:03:37,018
It's a boy!

545
01:03:52,568 --> 01:03:58,086
The years went by.
We lost touch.

546
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:05,626
But then, without warning,
the bastard threw me off the Board.

547
01:04:06,586 --> 01:04:08,545
I was so pissed off -

548
01:04:08,698 --> 01:04:12,873
- that I went out and bought a Saab 9000 CS.

549
01:04:14,563 --> 01:04:18,326
Then Rune bought a 960 Executive.

550
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,861
When their boy had grown up -

551
01:04:21,015 --> 01:04:24,240
- he suddenly decided to move to the USA.

552
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:26,890
They didn't say much after that.

553
01:04:27,691 --> 01:04:30,840
I had just looked at the new Saab 9-5 -

554
01:04:30,994 --> 01:04:35,410
- and thought it was time to put
old grudges behind us.

555
01:04:35,564 --> 01:04:40,364
- We just had to talk again.
- I've been thinking.

556
01:04:41,279 --> 01:04:45,541
Isn't it time we put old grudges behind us?

557
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:53,836
Of course. We're friends.

558
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:59,250
- That was when it happened.
- Do you want to see my new car?

559
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:03,324
BMW.

560
01:05:04,126 --> 01:05:08,235
I turned around and went home.
Rune gave up forever.

561
01:05:08,389 --> 01:05:11,845
Surely one can't drive Volvos his whole life?

562
01:05:13,311 --> 01:05:15,154
It was the last betrayal.

563
01:05:16,516 --> 01:05:19,762
Did you never have children?

564
01:05:26,307 --> 01:05:28,534
It's 2:00 now.

565
01:05:29,686 --> 01:05:35,634
Ove, I have to do the written part as well.
Can you help me?

566
01:05:36,445 --> 01:05:40,991
Uhhuh. It's part of the driver's test.

567
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:46,079
Thanks. That will be really nice.
You know them already.

568
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,188
- Who?
- The children, of course.

569
01:05:51,642 --> 01:05:57,220
- I don't know if this is such a good idea.
- Me neither. Maybe I should stay home?

570
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,390
No, it's a really good idea.

571
01:05:59,544 --> 01:06:01,617
[speaking Persian]

572
01:06:02,947 --> 01:06:05,981
- Call if anything comes up.
- Bye.

573
01:06:11,011 --> 01:06:14,118
I'm hungry, I'm hungry!

574
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:20,835
You're against animal testing,
but not against testing on children.

575
01:06:22,117 --> 01:06:24,728
Nasanin wants formula
before we go to bed.

576
01:06:24,882 --> 01:06:29,182
You have to wash the bottle yourself.
Dad can't install the dishwasher.

577
01:06:29,336 --> 01:06:34,827
He says that he's going to throw
the dishwasher out the window.

578
01:06:34,981 --> 01:06:37,285
Come, you have to see my room.

579
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:45,177
What's important to think about
when building a house?

580
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:48,902
Water.

581
01:06:49,056 --> 01:06:54,066
- And sewage.
- Exactly. And infrastructure, too.

582
01:06:54,586 --> 01:06:58,387
- Have you built houses before?
- Yes, but no stone houses.

583
01:06:58,541 --> 01:07:01,767
He said I was the best in the class.

584
01:07:04,724 --> 01:07:07,181
Did you agree to this?

585
01:07:10,656 --> 01:07:13,344
No! Wow...

586
01:07:18,376 --> 01:07:20,450
- Sepideh?
- Hi, Mom.

587
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:22,677
[speaking Persian]

588
01:07:23,867 --> 01:07:25,365
She's sleeping.

589
01:07:42,891 --> 01:07:44,734
What's this?

590
01:07:49,343 --> 01:07:52,415
What are you doing?
You again?

591
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:58,231
Regarding the woman's bicycle, it says,
"Bicycle parking absolutely forbidden".

592
01:07:58,405 --> 01:08:02,245
Didn't Sonja live here?
I was her student.

593
01:08:02,399 --> 01:08:06,085
I couldn't read or write,
but she didn't think I was stupid.

594
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:11,224
Then I learned everything. She was great.
Sorry for bothering you.

595
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:20,973
- Hey! What are you doing with the bike?
- Fixing it for my girlfriend.

596
01:08:21,453 --> 01:08:26,983
Maybe my girlfriend if I fix it.
I have to go to my other job.

597
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:31,668
I work at a kebab stand, too.
I'm saving for a car. A Renault.

598
01:08:31,822 --> 01:08:35,474
French?
You're going to buy a French car?

599
01:08:36,699 --> 01:08:39,617
Then an old student of yours showed up, too.

600
01:08:39,771 --> 01:08:45,755
So now I have to sort out another thing
before I can come. That's just how it is.

601
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,020
Stop! Hello!

602
01:09:11,715 --> 01:09:16,619
Good. Turn it off.
Now you can parallel park, too.

603
01:09:16,855 --> 01:09:20,619
- I just hit a car.
- It's nothing.

604
01:09:21,425 --> 01:09:26,327
It was a Volvo.
Wait here. I have to do something.

605
01:09:41,596 --> 01:09:45,014
The bike is fixed now.
So you can give it to your girlfriend.

606
01:09:45,168 --> 01:09:48,547
- Did you fix it?
- I just changed the tube.

607
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:52,464
- You eat kebabs?
- No, why would I do that?

608
01:09:53,769 --> 01:09:56,957
- What's he doing here?
- Why do you have black around your eyes?

609
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,721
- It's makeup.
- I thought girls used that.

610
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:02,947
- He thinks he looks great with it.
- Mmhmm.

611
01:10:03,101 --> 01:10:06,387
- He won't get any girls.
- I don't want any girls.

612
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:09,670
- Are you a fag?
- Ove! One doesn't say that.

613
01:10:09,824 --> 01:10:14,240
- He can say what he wants.
- Are you one of those gay people?

614
01:10:18,234 --> 01:10:21,344
Yes. I'm one of those gay people.

615
01:10:21,498 --> 01:10:24,071
I see. What are you fussing about?

616
01:10:25,299 --> 01:10:29,216
Don't say anything about Mirsad.
His Dad doesn't know about it.

617
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:34,567
I don't go around talking
about what others do.

618
01:10:36,002 --> 01:10:39,304
- You have a much worse problem.
- What's that?

619
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:42,146
Buying French cars?

620
01:10:44,028 --> 01:10:46,831
It might be good to know
what makes a car run.

621
01:10:46,984 --> 01:10:49,634
It's not as simple as one thinks.

622
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:51,823
I have to pee.

623
01:10:51,977 --> 01:10:56,162
- We should go over the engine.
- I can't. I'll be quick.

624
01:11:08,136 --> 01:11:11,323
- Hi. You're Ove, right?
- You're parked outside the lines.

625
01:11:11,477 --> 01:11:15,893
Lena Samuelsson, local newspaper.
It's about the accident at the train station.

626
01:11:16,046 --> 01:11:17,851
You saved a man's life there.

627
01:11:18,005 --> 01:11:22,037
- You're wrong, that wasn't me.
- I was there and saw it all.

628
01:11:22,565 --> 01:11:25,406
We have a series called "The Invisible Heroes".

629
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,595
I think you would be a good fit.

630
01:11:27,749 --> 01:11:31,205
I'm sure a lot of exciting things
happened in your life.

631
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:34,162
- Will you talk about it?
- No.

632
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:38,596
I have a letter from the man you saved.
You have to read it.

633
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:42,890
- It's really touching. Wait...
- I'm ready now.

634
01:11:47,121 --> 01:11:50,693
- There won't be anything.
- Why? What was that?

635
01:11:50,846 --> 01:11:54,801
- I didn't hear anything. Come on.
- Can you open up?

636
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:06,668
Well, so what? I didn't lock it.
Even an idiot can open it from inside.

637
01:12:07,128 --> 01:12:09,087
Idiots.

638
01:12:11,432 --> 01:12:13,083
Ove!

639
01:12:14,312 --> 01:12:16,270
Wait.

640
01:12:19,189 --> 01:12:24,569
Did you think she'd disappear just
because you locked her in the garage?

641
01:12:32,412 --> 01:12:34,371
God...

642
01:12:34,524 --> 01:12:37,020
You fucking knob.

643
01:12:43,741 --> 01:12:45,545
Ove...

644
01:12:53,191 --> 01:12:57,727
- I just thought of something.
- Stop bragging.

645
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:08,827
Seriously. I can help you clean
your house a bit.

646
01:13:08,981 --> 01:13:13,704
- Put things in boxes and the like.
- That won't be necessary.

647
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:17,659
- Sonja's things are still out.
- That won't be necessary, I said.

648
01:13:17,813 --> 01:13:22,575
- Wouldn't it be nice to move on?
- I said that you should stop talking!

649
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:31,255
I've never met Sonja, and she was
certainly wonderful.

650
01:13:31,409 --> 01:13:34,481
But you made her into some sort of saint.

651
01:13:34,634 --> 01:13:37,361
She probably would have
wanted to be a regular Sonja.

652
01:13:37,514 --> 01:13:40,318
A wonderful, but regular Sonja.

653
01:13:40,471 --> 01:13:43,275
- Quiet, I said!
- Don't yell.

654
01:13:50,373 --> 01:13:53,176
The more all the idiots babble about her -

655
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:58,533
- their noise drowns out that little
memory of her voice that I have left.

656
01:14:01,663 --> 01:14:05,964
There was nothing before Sonja.
And there's nothing after, either.

657
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:09,113
I exist.

658
01:14:09,266 --> 01:14:13,452
No, you bastard!
Stop, for fuck's sake! Stop!

659
01:14:24,575 --> 01:14:26,533
Wait a second.

660
01:14:33,321 --> 01:14:36,738
If you're done with your
neanderthal manners -

661
01:14:36,892 --> 01:14:39,234
- then we'll probably get along.

662
01:14:39,388 --> 01:14:42,921
- Move.
- Never. Go back, get lost.

663
01:14:44,457 --> 01:14:48,489
If you have a problem with us driving here,
call the administrator at the municipality.

664
01:14:48,643 --> 01:14:53,543
- You can help Rune in other ways.
- I don't give a shit about Rune.

665
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:55,670
Driving in here isn't permitted.

666
01:14:57,938 --> 01:15:00,242
Not another meter.

667
01:15:08,498 --> 01:15:11,685
What is it with you really, Ove?

668
01:15:11,839 --> 01:15:15,372
I know what it is.
You're paranoid.

669
01:15:15,525 --> 01:15:20,025
I did a little research on you
in the municipality archives -

670
01:15:20,505 --> 01:15:23,001
- and on the internet.

671
01:15:23,154 --> 01:15:25,497
And I know everything.

672
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:31,228
I've read all your silly posts,
your letters to the authorities.

673
01:15:31,413 --> 01:15:34,177
I know everything about your wife
and her accident.

674
01:15:34,331 --> 01:15:37,710
And how you blame everything
and everyone for it.

675
01:15:38,978 --> 01:15:43,701
But you know, what if it was
just that you weren't enough.

676
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:48,347
I'm going to report you.

677
01:15:48,501 --> 01:15:51,266
I'm employed by a private
healthcare company.

678
01:15:51,419 --> 01:15:55,068
We only do things that have already been decided.

679
01:15:55,221 --> 01:15:58,831
You must be scared about that heart, Ove.

680
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:08,747
What do you know about my heart? Huh?

681
01:16:10,705 --> 01:16:13,432
- What do you know about my heart, then?
- Drive.

682
01:16:13,585 --> 01:16:16,312
Answer! What do you know about my...

683
01:16:16,466 --> 01:16:20,574
Stop the car! Stop the car now!
You fucking idio...

684
01:16:20,728 --> 01:16:23,839
Fucking white shirts! What?!

685
01:16:26,565 --> 01:16:31,932
This is the last warning!
Tomorrow that winter boot will be a moccasin!

686
01:16:32,313 --> 01:16:34,194
Now he's really crazy.

687
01:16:45,907 --> 01:16:48,825
Just forget it.
Forget it, dammit.

688
01:16:50,515 --> 01:16:53,049
No! Fight!

689
01:17:05,081 --> 01:17:08,883
- Fucking white shirts.
- Ove.

690
01:17:10,188 --> 01:17:12,915
Ove, hello? Open up!

691
01:17:19,673 --> 01:17:21,555
Hello, Ove?

692
01:17:24,243 --> 01:17:26,355
How are you?

693
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:12,134
- Ove! You should stop now.
It's ready.

694
01:18:12,288 --> 01:18:13,862
Yep.

695
01:18:15,129 --> 01:18:19,045
Wait. Close your eyes first. Close your eyes.

696
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:24,422
Here. Here. Stop. Ta-da!

697
01:18:25,651 --> 01:18:28,493
- What's this?
- Come, we're going to dance.

698
01:18:28,646 --> 01:18:32,141
- No. No, no.
- Yes! Yes. Come on. Come on.

699
01:18:32,294 --> 01:18:34,599
I can't.

700
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:37,361
You can dance on the inside.

701
01:19:04,216 --> 01:19:09,335
Ove.
You're going to be a father.

702
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,664
We're going to be parents!

703
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:16,620
I love you, Ove.

704
01:19:16,773 --> 01:19:19,308
I love you, too.

705
01:19:20,252 --> 01:19:24,208
- But then we have to buy a station wagon.
- Yeah, or a cradle.

706
01:19:25,744 --> 01:19:28,240
Good idea. I'll build one.

707
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:03,089
Fucking rascals!
What are you doing?

708
01:21:03,243 --> 01:21:04,779
Uhh...

709
01:21:08,235 --> 01:21:11,230
- We just wanted to ask something...
- What?!

710
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:15,685
Mirsad was kicked out of his house.
I thought that maybe he could live here.

711
01:21:16,673 --> 01:21:20,749
Here? Do you think this is a fucking hotel?

712
01:21:22,126 --> 01:21:24,046
Mirsad came out today.

713
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:27,847
I told my dad that I was one of those gay people.

714
01:21:28,001 --> 01:21:29,883
And he hates fags.

715
01:21:30,036 --> 01:21:33,377
He'd kill himself if any of his children were.

716
01:21:33,531 --> 01:21:36,334
But yeah, yeah, whatever. We're going.

717
01:21:37,486 --> 01:21:40,788
Sonja always helped other people.

718
01:21:57,247 --> 01:21:59,244
Okay, come on, then.

719
01:22:23,348 --> 01:22:25,307
Good morning.

720
01:22:27,227 --> 01:22:31,796
I made some toast, if that's okay.
And I made a little coffee, too.

721
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:37,310
- I'm going to go on my rounds.
- Aren't you going to have coffee first?

722
01:22:38,615 --> 01:22:41,803
I made a little bit here.
Sandwiches with cheese and stuff.

723
01:22:47,793 --> 01:22:49,790
Before the rounds?

724
01:23:06,304 --> 01:23:09,031
No, I have to go do the rounds now.

725
01:23:09,185 --> 01:23:11,412
Can I come along?

726
01:23:12,641 --> 01:23:15,137
It's a free country.

727
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:16,788
Oh? Okay.

728
01:23:20,513 --> 01:23:22,394
Wait!

729
01:23:25,905 --> 01:23:28,939
Hey. Can I come with?

730
01:23:29,093 --> 01:23:31,589
I started exercising.

731
01:23:31,742 --> 01:23:34,507
- Hey. Jimmy.
- Hey. Mirsad.

732
01:23:38,868 --> 01:23:41,595
- Did you fight with your father?
- Yeah.

733
01:23:41,749 --> 01:23:44,321
He didn't jump for joy.

734
01:23:58,387 --> 01:24:00,691
- Did you hear about Rune?
- No.

735
01:24:00,844 --> 01:24:04,056
They're picking him up tomorrow.
He's going to go in the institution.

736
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:08,069
Bullshit. It takes years before it happens.

737
01:24:08,222 --> 01:24:10,219
Ask me, I know.

738
01:24:10,373 --> 01:24:14,366
I promise. The decision was made.
They're coming tomorrow.

739
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:18,706
She appealed three years ago.
So now they'll be separated.

740
01:24:18,993 --> 01:24:24,398
Three years. Lies.
Sonja would have known about that.

741
01:24:24,878 --> 01:24:27,835
- Me too.
- Anita said nothing to Sonja.

742
01:24:27,988 --> 01:24:31,252
- She didn't want you to know.
- Why didn't she want us to know?

743
01:24:31,406 --> 01:24:33,479
She didn't want to ask for help.

744
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:37,473
She said that you had enough
problems of your own.

745
01:24:38,625 --> 01:24:40,891
She said that?

746
01:24:41,044 --> 01:24:45,653
She said we shouldn't know because
we had enough of our own problems?

747
01:24:45,806 --> 01:24:47,957
Yeah, so what?

748
01:24:51,751 --> 01:24:55,322
Idiot. That's what I've been.

749
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:07,457
You mustn't be angry with me, Sonja.

750
01:25:09,639 --> 01:25:12,480
It's hard to admit that one's been wrong.

751
01:25:12,634 --> 01:25:15,552
Especially when one's been
wrong for a long time.

752
01:25:17,242 --> 01:25:19,162
I'm sorry.

753
01:25:22,465 --> 01:25:25,268
But now it's going to be put right.

754
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:33,104
I know how you tend to worry when I fight.

755
01:25:33,257 --> 01:25:36,329
But this time, I think you'll agree with me.

756
01:25:36,483 --> 01:25:38,403
Now it's fucking war!

757
01:25:38,557 --> 01:25:42,166
Give me every single paper between
you and the municipality -

758
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:46,890
- and insurance office, county, church.
I want the works on Rune.

759
01:25:51,696 --> 01:25:55,690
To cancel your service, press star.

760
01:25:57,341 --> 01:26:00,145
Can I borrow your phone?

761
01:26:00,836 --> 01:26:03,332
For the neighbors.

762
01:26:03,486 --> 01:26:08,554
It doesn't fucking matter if
we've already appealed.

763
01:26:08,708 --> 01:26:14,084
Because there's a higher court.
Can't you read? Are you illiterate?

764
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:18,291
Illiterate! Hello?

765
01:26:19,789 --> 01:26:21,555
Hello?!

766
01:26:22,938 --> 01:26:25,519
How can one reason with
people who hang up?

767
01:26:25,999 --> 01:26:29,762
- How can you reason if you're just yelling?
- They're not listening.

768
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:31,913
Sit down.

769
01:26:33,449 --> 01:26:35,446
Turn that off.

770
01:26:37,695 --> 01:26:40,537
It's the same people all the time.

771
01:26:40,690 --> 01:26:43,647
The same people.
That's how it's always been.

772
01:26:43,801 --> 01:26:47,564
Their names are different,
but they're the same.

773
01:26:47,718 --> 01:26:50,751
The only place for a municipality bastard.

774
01:26:50,905 --> 01:26:53,631
Those fucking white shirts.

775
01:26:58,033 --> 01:27:00,184
Listen to yourself.

776
01:27:01,259 --> 01:27:04,792
You said to me that one never
gives up, right?

777
01:27:04,945 --> 01:27:08,593
Then you sit there and feel sorry for yourself.

778
01:27:08,747 --> 01:27:12,165
Because you had it bad,
everyone's an idiot...

779
01:27:12,318 --> 01:27:14,699
So you just give up.

780
01:27:14,853 --> 01:27:21,021
All because you think everyone on
this planet can manage without help.

781
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:23,934
But you know what, Ove?

782
01:27:24,087 --> 01:27:28,734
No one manages alone. No one.
Not even you.

783
01:27:28,887 --> 01:27:31,191
You can go now.

784
01:27:32,113 --> 01:27:36,832
You can go, I said.
I don't have to energy for you anymore.

785
01:27:59,905 --> 01:28:02,439
It was her idea from the start.

786
01:28:02,593 --> 01:28:07,860
That we'd travel together, just she and I,
before the child came.

787
01:28:08,967 --> 01:28:12,193
She was adamant that we
should go by bus.

788
01:28:12,347 --> 01:28:16,625
Because that was more romantic, she said.

789
01:28:18,132 --> 01:28:20,513
And I didn't object.

790
01:28:20,666 --> 01:28:24,429
It was a little cheaper, too.

791
01:28:54,116 --> 01:28:59,757
Down in Spain, Sonja thought
that one should do as the Romans do.

792
01:29:00,683 --> 01:29:04,523
I discovered that the Spaniards
had a lot to learn -

793
01:29:04,677 --> 01:29:08,209
- when it came to Swedish
building standards.

794
01:29:15,896 --> 01:29:17,816
We had it good.

795
01:29:18,815 --> 01:29:21,695
In the evenings, we went out and ate.

796
01:29:24,153 --> 01:29:26,687
We saved a little food from the lunch buffet -

797
01:29:26,841 --> 01:29:30,143
- that made for a fine dinner outside.

798
01:29:33,522 --> 01:29:35,250
Skål.

799
01:29:39,743 --> 01:29:42,931
One day it was time to go home.

800
01:29:48,799 --> 01:29:50,643
Hola.

801
01:29:54,195 --> 01:29:56,883
- Hola.
- No thanks. No, no!

802
01:29:58,534 --> 01:30:01,145
- What did he say?
- He seems happy.

803
01:30:01,299 --> 01:30:04,755
We come, we come, from
Pepperkaker land.

804
01:30:04,908 --> 01:30:08,557
on the road, on the road,
we wander hand in hand.

805
01:30:10,161 --> 01:30:11,927
- Let them be, Ove.
- What?

806
01:30:12,081 --> 01:30:14,615
- They're having fun.
- They are?

807
01:30:26,788 --> 01:30:31,358
On the bus, Sonja wanted me
to feel her stomach -

808
01:30:31,512 --> 01:30:35,626
- because the child, she kicked in there.

809
01:30:35,741 --> 01:30:38,390
Here, feel.

810
01:30:42,307 --> 01:30:45,765
- Do you feel it?
- It's constant.

811
01:30:49,219 --> 01:30:51,523
I'm just going to go to the toilet.

812
01:32:03,869 --> 01:32:05,789
Sonja?

813
01:32:19,402 --> 01:32:21,706
Sonja? Sonja?

814
01:32:28,925 --> 01:32:30,538
Sonja!

815
01:32:33,879 --> 01:32:36,260
Help! Help!

816
01:32:45,169 --> 01:32:47,166
You can go in to her.

817
01:33:05,945 --> 01:33:08,748
I probably sat with her for a week.

818
01:33:08,902 --> 01:33:13,395
Not a soul dared to talk to me.
And that was probably for the best.

819
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,774
Until one day...

820
01:33:19,688 --> 01:33:22,913
They said that Sonja would never wake up.

821
01:33:23,067 --> 01:33:26,101
Don't you fucking say that to me!

822
01:33:27,675 --> 01:33:30,555
And then, inexplicably, it happened.

823
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:36,408
It was as if the best and the worst
happened at the same time.

824
01:34:02,819 --> 01:34:06,928
The day after, I was forced to tell her
about everything that happened.

825
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:37,484
About a life that no longer existed.

826
01:34:39,481 --> 01:34:44,517
In the midst of that pain,
I felt a kind of inner strength.

827
01:34:44,997 --> 01:34:49,951
At first, I turned that anger into
something fruitful.

828
01:34:54,636 --> 01:34:57,823
Sonja continued to study.

829
01:34:57,977 --> 01:35:01,126
She had a year left on her teaching degree.

830
01:35:01,648 --> 01:35:04,835
But when she finished, there were no jobs.

831
01:35:04,989 --> 01:35:06,947
I'm really sorry, but you have good grades.

832
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:10,826
At that time, the schools weren't
handicap-accessible.

833
01:35:13,752 --> 01:35:19,262
But then one day, Sonja saw an ad in the paper.

834
01:35:19,896 --> 01:35:24,389
A class where they bundled all
the letter combinations that existed -

835
01:35:24,543 --> 01:35:28,252
- before the combinations
were even invented.

836
01:35:28,968 --> 01:35:32,578
Your CV seems really good, but we're unable -

837
01:35:32,732 --> 01:35:35,765
- to take on a disabled teacher.

838
01:35:38,246 --> 01:35:42,701
Then I went into the great darkness.
I wanted to obliterate everyone.

839
01:35:42,854 --> 01:35:46,310
Every bastard.
The bus company, the driver -

840
01:35:46,464 --> 01:35:49,113
- the vineyard, the travel
company...everyone.

841
01:35:49,267 --> 01:35:52,378
I wrote to the Spanish and
Swedish governments -

842
01:35:52,531 --> 01:35:54,374
- but no one cared.

843
01:35:54,528 --> 01:35:58,483
The idea is that one expands the entrance...

844
01:35:58,637 --> 01:36:03,130
They didn't even want to build a ramp
so that Sonja could start at the school.

845
01:36:04,073 --> 01:36:08,028
I wrote to everyone to try to get some justice -

846
01:36:08,181 --> 01:36:11,292
- for something I didn't even know
the answer to myself.

847
01:36:11,446 --> 01:36:15,785
Until finally, Sonja...
She was the strongest of all.

848
01:36:16,822 --> 01:36:18,319
Ove.

849
01:36:23,070 --> 01:36:26,295
Either we die or we live.

850
01:36:31,323 --> 01:36:36,200
That night, I took the car and built
what was needed in one night.

851
01:36:49,961 --> 01:36:53,609
The next day, Sonja was able to start working.

852
01:36:58,294 --> 01:36:59,945
Welcome.

853
01:37:04,265 --> 01:37:07,644
Homer wrote The Iliad about the Trojan war.

854
01:37:07,798 --> 01:37:10,294
But when was The Iliad written?

855
01:37:10,448 --> 01:37:12,598
- David?
- The year 700.

856
01:37:12,752 --> 01:37:15,248
- B.C.
- Tool.

857
01:37:22,349 --> 01:37:25,306
Let's say hello to Richard Stenebo.
Welcome to our class.

858
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:27,840
- Hi, Richard!
- Welcome.

859
01:37:27,994 --> 01:37:33,447
I'm not lying.
In one year, the same student could -

860
01:37:33,601 --> 01:37:37,863
- cite 400-year-old poetry with ease at graduation.

861
01:37:38,938 --> 01:37:42,087
So infinite in her skills.

862
01:37:42,241 --> 01:37:46,388
So like a god in her form -

863
01:37:46,542 --> 01:37:49,115
- and her actions.

864
01:37:49,268 --> 01:37:51,534
A model of an animal.

865
01:37:52,609 --> 01:37:54,990
Yet, to me...

866
01:37:56,449 --> 01:37:59,561
...she's only dust.

867
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:08,197
Bravo!

868
01:38:08,351 --> 01:38:11,192
She fought for what was good.

869
01:38:15,339 --> 01:38:18,895
For the child she never had.

870
01:38:22,869 --> 01:38:26,671
She died six months ago - from cancer.

871
01:38:29,512 --> 01:38:33,211
And I promised to follow her.

872
01:39:02,469 --> 01:39:07,497
- Today's the day. Is he ready?
- Don't come any farther.

873
01:39:09,186 --> 01:39:12,988
You've had three years to prepare
for this nice and peacefully.

874
01:39:13,871 --> 01:39:16,674
The decision was made.

875
01:39:16,828 --> 01:39:21,129
- We're doing this for your sake, Anita.
- What about love?

876
01:39:21,283 --> 01:39:25,355
Separating when you need each other most?

877
01:39:26,687 --> 01:39:32,713
The problem is that he has no idea
where he is 24 hours a day.

878
01:39:33,061 --> 01:39:35,020
No, but I know.

879
01:39:35,173 --> 01:39:36,786
Oh!

880
01:39:37,708 --> 01:39:41,317
- And who's going to take care of him?
- I will.

881
01:39:41,471 --> 01:39:46,757
- With a little help...from...
- A little help? From who?

882
01:39:49,186 --> 01:39:53,487
- Hi, how nice. Lena, from the local paper.
- Hey.

883
01:39:54,294 --> 01:40:00,438
I have the last three years' statements
from the healthcare company Konsensus -

884
01:40:00,592 --> 01:40:04,816
- that you're a shareholder of.
There's a marginal profit reported.

885
01:40:04,969 --> 01:40:08,963
At the same time, I have statements
from a bank in the Canary Islands.

886
01:40:09,117 --> 01:40:13,034
It's had millions in deposits.

887
01:40:13,514 --> 01:40:16,355
- Where did you get them?
- On the internet.

888
01:40:16,509 --> 01:40:19,466
My editor would be happy to run this -

889
01:40:19,619 --> 01:40:23,805
- but the decision is mine, if
you understand what I mean.

890
01:40:44,287 --> 01:40:46,822
He left right away.

891
01:40:48,473 --> 01:40:51,276
It was better in our time.

892
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:55,231
Then, people at least fought for their principles.

893
01:41:31,126 --> 01:41:34,006
Ove! Ove!

894
01:41:35,734 --> 01:41:37,577
Ove! Call an ambulance!

895
01:41:37,731 --> 01:41:41,724
Don't let the fucking ambulance
drive into the association.

896
01:41:51,413 --> 01:41:54,024
Over by the window.

897
01:42:20,147 --> 01:42:24,064
Hi. Parvaneh, you're listed as next of kin.

898
01:42:24,887 --> 01:42:29,918
Your dad suffers from a heart condition.
One could say his heart is too big.

899
01:42:31,530 --> 01:42:37,011
- Sorry, too big?
- Yes. But he'll survive.

900
01:42:45,553 --> 01:42:46,973
Ove!

901
01:42:47,127 --> 01:42:50,430
You're too fucking sick to die.

902
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:05,751
Oh shit, I think this is the day, Ove!

903
01:43:07,211 --> 01:43:08,824
Shit!

904
01:43:15,855 --> 01:43:18,504
It was just gathering dust.

905
01:43:18,658 --> 01:43:22,268
- But it was never used.
- It's really nice, Ove. Thanks.

906
01:43:22,421 --> 01:43:25,877
- It might need to be painted a bit.
- Here, hold the baby.

907
01:43:26,031 --> 01:43:28,988
I'm going to show it to Patrick.

908
01:43:39,817 --> 01:43:41,891
Hey, you.

909
01:43:50,108 --> 01:43:52,489
Just lie down here...

910
01:43:59,117 --> 01:44:01,613
You're happy.

911
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:13,441
- Yeah, you're getting something, too.
- An ipad! Thanks, grandpa!

912
01:44:15,248 --> 01:44:18,358
I know that feeling.

913
01:44:18,512 --> 01:44:21,008
It's like when I buy a new car.

914
01:44:26,537 --> 01:44:29,110
This is the life.

915
01:44:46,214 --> 01:44:50,115
Hey...
It isn't shoveled in front of Ove's house.

916
01:44:50,595 --> 01:44:53,744
- Who cares.
- But it's 8:00.

917
01:44:53,897 --> 01:44:56,662
It's time for his rounds.

918
01:45:02,192 --> 01:45:03,997
Ove!

919
01:45:31,792 --> 01:45:35,440
Don't be worried that I did something stupid.

920
01:45:35,594 --> 01:45:40,202
If you're reading this, the doctor's
diagnosis was right.

921
01:45:40,356 --> 01:45:43,313
She said my heart was too big.

922
01:45:43,466 --> 01:45:47,345
But even if that sounds nice, it's not so good.

923
01:45:48,228 --> 01:45:51,569
Sooner or later, one pays for it.

924
01:45:52,703 --> 01:45:56,467
I wish for the funeral to be
in a church as it should be.

925
01:45:56,620 --> 01:46:01,497
No fuss with ashes spread in the wind
or any of that nonsense.

926
01:46:02,299 --> 01:46:05,563
I want it done quietly, with only
those closest to me -

927
01:46:05,717 --> 01:46:08,443
- who think that I've done right by me.

928
01:46:08,597 --> 01:46:12,302
The cat eats tuna twice a day, and
doesn't want shit in other people's houses.

929
01:46:12,782 --> 01:46:13,760
Respect that.

930
01:46:14,011 --> 01:46:18,120
And for fuck's sake, don't let any
fucking cars in the association.

931
01:48:08,353 --> 01:48:18,521
