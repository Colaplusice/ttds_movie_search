2
00:00:47,644 --> 00:00:50,776
Our last rainy season.

3
00:00:50,778 --> 00:00:52,876
Just think, Pastuzo,

4
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,842
this time next month
we'll be in London.

5
00:00:55,844 --> 00:00:58,708
Where the rivers run
with marmalade

6
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,642
and the streets are paved
with bread.

7
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,875
Did you read the book
about London?

8
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:05,010
I skimmed it.

9
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:07,077
Oh, Pastuzo.

10
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,908
Well, reading makes me sleepy.

11
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,643
But any city that can
come up with this

12
00:01:12,645 --> 00:01:14,843
is all right by me.

13
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,478
Ooh, Pastuzo, look!

14
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:23,412
It's... It's a cub.

15
00:01:23,878 --> 00:01:25,110
Lucy!

16
00:01:25,112 --> 00:01:27,144
Lower me down.

17
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:29,210
Be careful.

18
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:43,375
Lower, Pastuzo. Lower.

19
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,077
Lucy?

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,609
Lucy!

21
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:07,508
I'm afraid we're not going
to London after all.

22
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,142
Why not?

23
00:02:09,144 --> 00:02:12,410
We've got a cub to raise.

24
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:15,177
- What's he like?
- Rather small.

25
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:17,944
And rather sneezy.

26
00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:21,909
But he likes his marmalade.

27
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:24,276
That's a good sign.

28
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:26,177
Oh, yes, Pastuzo.

29
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:31,845
If we look after this bear,
I have a feeling he'll go far.

30
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:52,876
<i>Dear Aunt Lucy.</i>

31
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,709
<i>I hope all is well
in the Home for Retired Bears.</i>

32
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:59,110
<i>Life in London has been
better than ever this summer.</i>

33
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,742
<i>I've really got to grips
with how things work.</i>

34
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:11,143
<i>And it seems there's something
new to do every day.</i>

35
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:12,542
- Guess what, Paddington?
- Hmm?

36
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:14,475
The steam fair
is coming to town.

37
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:15,609
I'm going along tonight
to write about it

38
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:16,943
- in my newspaper.
- Ooh.

39
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:18,842
Who's going to want
to read about that?

40
00:03:18,844 --> 00:03:21,609
Everyone. They travel the
world in an old steam train.

41
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:23,408
- I thought you'd love it.
- I do.

42
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,742
Don't tell anyone, okay?
Not cool.

43
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:27,676
- Why don't we all go?
- Good idea.

44
00:03:27,678 --> 00:03:29,476
Your father's a dab hand
at the coconut shy.

45
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:31,843
"Bullseye Brown"
they used to call him.

46
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,777
Not anymore. Coconuts are
a young man's game.

47
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:36,542
Well, I think you're in great
shape for a man your age,

48
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:38,409
- Mr. Brown.
- Ah, thank you, Paddington.

49
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:40,476
Hang on,
how old do you think I am?

50
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:43,208
Oh, er, about 80.

51
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,408
- 80?
- At least.

52
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,842
- Just a minute, young bear.
- Hmm?

53
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:50,676
Thought I told you
to wash behind your ears.

54
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:51,943
Oh, but I did, Mrs. Bird.
I...

55
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:53,910
I wonder how
that got in there.

56
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:57,376
<i>I really feel at home
in Windsor Gardens.</i>

57
00:03:57,378 --> 00:03:58,542
<i>Bonjour, Mademoiselle.</i>

58
00:03:58,544 --> 00:04:00,576
Good morning, Paddington.

59
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:02,676
- I brought you breakfast.
- Thank you.

60
00:04:02,678 --> 00:04:05,309
Your sandwiches always
put me in a good mood.

61
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,676
Morning, Doctor Jafri.

62
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:09,010
You haven't forgotten
your keys, have you?

63
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:10,975
Keys? Keys!

64
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:12,110
Oh. Oh!

65
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:13,442
Well caught.

66
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:15,441
- Thank you, Paddington.
- You're welcome.

67
00:04:15,443 --> 00:04:17,142
Glorious day, Colonel.

68
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:19,942
Is it?
How absolutely thrilling.

69
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:21,675
How was your date,
Miss Kitts?

70
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:23,909
Well, he wasn't the one,
but you know what they say.

71
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:26,509
- Plenty more fish in the sea.
- Exactly.

72
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:27,812
Thank you.

73
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:33,643
- Morning, Paddington.
- Morning, Mr. Barnes.

74
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:36,009
- Bye, Paddington.
- <i>Au revoir, mademoiselle.</i>

75
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:37,743
Right, test me.

76
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:40,509
What's the quickest way
from Baker Street to Big Ben?

77
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:41,710
Ah, an easy one.

78
00:04:41,712 --> 00:04:43,809
Turn right
onto Portman Square...

79
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:46,510
<i>Everyone has
been so kind and welcoming</i>

80
00:04:46,512 --> 00:04:49,175
<i>even though they're very busy.</i>

81
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:52,375
<i>Mrs. Brown is planning to
swim to France.</i>

82
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:54,608
<i>It seems an awful lot
of hard work</i>

83
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,177
<i>when you can go by boat</i>

84
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:58,743
<i>or plane or even train.
But that's not the point.</i>

85
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:00,509
<i>She's been cooped up
all summer</i>

86
00:05:00,511 --> 00:05:03,209
<i>illustrating a series
of adventure stories</i>

87
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:06,442
<i>and has decided
she wants one of her own.</i>

88
00:05:06,444 --> 00:05:09,109
Whoo-hoo!

89
00:05:09,111 --> 00:05:11,776
<i>Judy has been
suffering from a broken heart.</i>

90
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,208
I'm dumped? I think you'll
find you're dumped, Tony!

91
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,777
<i>Her first
reaction was to become a nun.</i>

92
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,309
<i>But she soon got over that</i>

93
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:22,009
<i>and has thrown herself
into a new hobby.</i>

94
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:24,242
<i>She found an old
printing press at school</i>

95
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:27,475
<i>and is starting a newspaper
with no boys.</i>

96
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:29,775
Now all we need is some news.

97
00:05:29,777 --> 00:05:31,176
<i>Jonathan is joining her</i>

98
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:32,575
<i>at big school this year.</i>

99
00:05:32,577 --> 00:05:33,976
<i>He spent the holidays</i>

100
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:36,176
<i>building a fully-working
steam engine,</i>

101
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:38,542
<i>but I'm not supposed
to talk about that</i>

102
00:05:38,544 --> 00:05:40,476
<i>as it's "not cool."</i>

103
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:42,042
<i>He's got a whole new look,</i>

104
00:05:42,044 --> 00:05:45,408
<i>and if anyone asks,
he's now called J-Dog,</i>

105
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,079
<i>and he's definitely not
into steam trains.</i>

106
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:51,909
<i>But Mr. Brown has been
busiest of all.</i>

107
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,308
<i>He recently had a surprise
at work.</i>

108
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,975
I am delighted
to announce,

109
00:05:55,977 --> 00:05:59,308
our new Head of Risk Analysis
will be

110
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,375
Mr. Steve Visby.

111
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:05,208
<i>And
this has prompted</i>

112
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,642
<i>what Mrs. Bird calls "a
full-blown midlife crisis."</i>

113
00:06:08,644 --> 00:06:11,509
<i>It involves
blending his food,</i>

114
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,875
<i>painting his hair,</i>

115
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:16,808
<i>and engaging in a process
called "Chakrabatics."</i>

116
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,208
Open your mind
and your legs will follow.

117
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:25,076
- Thank you, Paddington.
- Keep up the good work.

118
00:06:25,078 --> 00:06:28,274
<i>Oh, Aunt Lucy, you sent me
to London to find a home,</i>

119
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:31,242
<i>and it's worked out better
than I ever imagined.</i>

120
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:32,842
<i>I have a wonderful family.</i>

121
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,141
<i>And have made friends
in all sorts of places.</i>

122
00:06:36,143 --> 00:06:38,042
Here, boy.

123
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:39,644
There you go, Wolfie.

124
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:44,409
<i>I do hope if you could see me,
you'd be pleased.</i>

125
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:46,809
<i>Lots of love from Paddington.</i>

126
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:48,376
Mr. Gruber?

127
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:50,642
Ah, Mr. Brown, come in.

128
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,876
I just had a visit
from Madame Kozlova

129
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:55,108
who runs the fair.

130
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,743
Oh, yes?

131
00:06:56,745 --> 00:06:59,476
They were having a clear out
and found all these old crates

132
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:01,743
stuffed full with memory-bilia
they thought

133
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:03,809
- had been lost forever.
- Oh!

134
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:05,475
She asked me
if I would sell it

135
00:07:05,477 --> 00:07:07,043
for them while
they're in town.

136
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:10,077
And it struck me there might
be something in here

137
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,942
for your auntie's birthday.

138
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:13,476
Oh, good idea.

139
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:17,009
Ah, look at this!

140
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:20,943
It's very nice, Mr. Gruber,
but...

141
00:07:20,945 --> 00:07:23,442
I know, I know,
it has to be perfect.

142
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:24,910
Well,
since Uncle Pastuzo died,

143
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,875
I'm the only relative
she's got left.

144
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:29,408
And it isn't every day
a bear turns 100.

145
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,675
Quite so. Ah!

146
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:34,609
How about these rolling shoes?

147
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:36,576
Please, Mr. Gruber,
be serious.

148
00:07:36,578 --> 00:07:39,643
Perhaps your auntie's
rolling days are behind her.

149
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:41,975
I think you might be right.

150
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:44,243
Oh, what's this?

151
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:47,276
Ah, that must be
the popping book.

152
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:48,910
Very interesting.

153
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:49,977
Really?

154
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,575
You see, Madame Kozlova's
great-grandmother,

155
00:07:52,577 --> 00:07:54,109
who started the fair,

156
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,542
was also a brilliant artist.

157
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,108
And every time
they visited a new city,

158
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,708
she made a popping book
to remember it by.

159
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,642
Oh!

160
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:04,911
And this is London.

161
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:13,811
Oh, Mr. Gruber,
it's wonderful.

162
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,942
Aunt Lucy always dreamed
of coming to London

163
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:19,576
and never had the chance.

164
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:21,810
But if she saw this,

165
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:24,643
it would be like
she were finally here.

166
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,375
Aunt Lucy! Aunt Lucy!

167
00:08:34,377 --> 00:08:35,779
Paddington!

168
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:40,711
Oh!

169
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:47,842
Come with me, Aunt Lucy.

170
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:53,710
Oh, yes, please.
I want to see everything.

171
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:56,342
Get all
your racing news right here.

172
00:08:56,344 --> 00:09:00,578
- Well, what do you think?
- It's wonderful.

173
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:04,376
All aboard.

174
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:08,276
- One and a half bears, please.
- Mind your step, madam.

175
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:10,478
What a polite young man.

176
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:15,445
What a polite young pigeon.

177
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:30,778
Oh, Paddington, you've made
an old bear so very happy.

178
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:34,511
This is perfect.

179
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:37,341
- Oh.
- Huh?

180
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,075
We have a snag.

181
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:40,643
Do we?

182
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:43,642
You see, this popping book
is the only one of its kind,

183
00:09:43,644 --> 00:09:46,241
and they want rather
a lot of money for it.

184
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:50,274
Oh, well, Mrs. Bird found this
coin in my ear at breakfast.

185
00:09:50,276 --> 00:09:51,974
Perhaps there's more.

186
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:54,608
It would take more
than an earful, Mr. Brown.

187
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,242
I'm afraid you would need
a thousand of those coins.

188
00:09:58,244 --> 00:09:59,543
Oh.

189
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:01,676
Let's take another look
at the monkey.

190
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:03,476
I think he's super-duper.

191
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,908
Oh!

192
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,675
I can fix that.

193
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:09,941
That's very kind, Mr. Gruber,

194
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,709
but Aunt Lucy did so much
for me when I was a cub,

195
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:16,108
and this could be my way
of saying thank you.

196
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,643
I'm going to get a job
and buy that book.

197
00:10:19,645 --> 00:10:21,642
Back in a few minutes,
Paddington.

198
00:10:21,644 --> 00:10:24,712
- Ciao ciao.
- Ciao ciao, Mr. Giuseppe.

199
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:30,375
Good afternoon. Welcome to
Giuseppe's grooming salon.

200
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:32,141
What can I do for you
today, sir?

201
00:10:32,143 --> 00:10:34,142
A shave? A light pomade?

202
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:35,341
Or is it just a brush?

203
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:38,075
Quick trim, barber.

204
00:10:38,077 --> 00:10:40,276
Oh, I'm not the barber.
I just tidy up.

205
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:41,742
That's all I want.

206
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:44,076
Tidy up the back and sides,
nothing off the top.

207
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:45,408
Yes, but...

208
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,608
No buts.
Come on, man, chop-chop.

209
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,544
If you say so, sir.

210
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:54,242
Hmm.

211
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:55,478
Ah.

212
00:10:58,011 --> 00:10:59,810
Hmm...

213
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:02,344
Oh. Whoa!

214
00:11:23,144 --> 00:11:25,476
Giuseppe's?

215
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:29,008
Would you mind
if I call you back?

216
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,811
I think I may be about to
shave a customer.

217
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:35,978
Oh, thank goodness.

218
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:43,209
Just putting you on hold.

219
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:46,676
But I don't want to.

220
00:11:46,678 --> 00:11:48,242
It's only a
haircut, Nelson.

221
00:11:48,244 --> 00:11:49,911
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

222
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,409
Come in. Take a seat.

223
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:55,478
We'll go somewhere else.

224
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,077
Oh, that's not good.

225
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:06,512
Oh... Um...

226
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:10,977
No.

227
00:12:11,977 --> 00:12:12,977
Um...

228
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:14,744
Ah.

229
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:24,975
Just giving you
some product, sir.

230
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,311
Ah, jolly good. Carry on.

231
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:31,276
All done.

232
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,943
I must say, it's turned out
a lot better than I expected.

233
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:42,309
What... What the devil's that?

234
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:44,611
It's, er, marmalade.

235
00:12:45,177 --> 00:12:46,775
Marmalade?

236
00:12:46,777 --> 00:12:48,874
Hairy marmalade.

237
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:50,541
Well, get it off!

238
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,874
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

239
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:55,842
Oh, yuck!
What is the matter with you?

240
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:58,509
- Paddington!
- Mr. Giuseppe. I can explain.

241
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,309
It's really not as bad
as it looks.

242
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:06,808
Have you ever been fired,
Mr. Brown?

243
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,176
Well, no,
but are you quite sure

244
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:11,543
you're ready for
the workplace, Paddington?

245
00:13:11,545 --> 00:13:14,008
It's a tough,
competitive world out there,

246
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,275
and I worry
a good-natured little bear

247
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:17,774
might get trampled underfoot.

248
00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:20,007
He's right, you know?
You can't trust anyone.

249
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,308
That's why
I'm doing my newspaper alone.

250
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,142
Darling,
is this about Tony?

251
00:13:24,144 --> 00:13:25,275
No!

252
00:13:25,277 --> 00:13:26,807
Everything is about Tony.

253
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:28,041
And the only reason no-one's
helping with your paper

254
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:29,343
is because it's so lame.

255
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:30,608
Well, at least
I'm not pretending

256
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,076
to be someone I'm not.

257
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,508
Nor am I. G-Man.

258
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,442
- J-Dog.
- Spud bounce.

259
00:13:35,444 --> 00:13:36,975
But Aunt Lucy said,

260
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:39,309
"If we're kind and polite,
the world will be right."

261
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:41,109
At least
someone's making sense.

262
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,142
Sorry. You're kind, Mr. Brown,
and you made it to the top.

263
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:47,008
I'm nowhere near the top.
I peaked in the middle.

264
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,276
Now my hair's gone grey,

265
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:50,841
my belly's popped out,
and I've started to creak.

266
00:13:52,244 --> 00:13:53,909
Oh, doesn't that man live in
the big house on the corner?

267
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:55,676
It's Phoenix Buchanan.

268
00:13:55,678 --> 00:13:57,408
Dad's 'celebrity' client.

269
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,541
He's one of
our Platinum Club members.

270
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:01,908
And a very famous actor.

271
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,608
Or used to be.

272
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,109
Now he just does
dog food commercials.

273
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,441
Mrs. Bird doesn't like him

274
00:14:07,443 --> 00:14:09,242
because he can never remember
her name.

275
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:10,543
Now then,
simmer down, simmer...

276
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:12,142
All right, little bit more.

277
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:14,807
That's enough.

278
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:18,543
I'm sorry, I'm at my worst
tonight. I really am. I am

279
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:21,709
tickled the deepest shade
of shrimp

280
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:23,576
to have been asked here
tonight

281
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:26,008
to open this
wonderful old steam fair.

282
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,108
But you know,

283
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,241
when Madame Kozlova created
this thing

284
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,809
all those years ago,

285
00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:33,808
she most certainly was not
thinking of people like me,

286
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,975
whatever I am,

287
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:38,409
'VIP, ' 'celebrity.'
I hate all that stuff.

288
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,609
No, no... 'West End legend, '

289
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:41,875
that's another one.

290
00:14:41,877 --> 00:14:45,376
No, no, she was thinking
of you guys, huh?

291
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:46,541
The ordinary people.

292
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:49,576
So, I'm gonna ask
one of you to

293
00:14:49,578 --> 00:14:51,309
come up here
and open the fair.

294
00:14:51,311 --> 00:14:52,841
Volunteers? Anyone.

295
00:14:52,843 --> 00:14:53,975
Me. Me.

296
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,175
Eeny, meeny, miney...

297
00:14:57,776 --> 00:14:58,941
...bear!

298
00:14:58,943 --> 00:15:01,741
Let's have the young bear.
Why not?

299
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:04,441
- Come, come, young ursine.
- Thank you.

300
00:15:04,443 --> 00:15:07,042
Up here, my furry friend.
Very good, very good.

301
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:09,808
- Now, your name is?
- Paddington Brown.

302
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,908
Oh, well, of course it is.
You are my new neighbor.

303
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,475
You live with

304
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:17,675
Henry and Mary
and the great Mrs...

305
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:21,510
Now then, I suppose you know
who I am?

306
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:23,775
Oh, yes,
you're a very famous actor.

307
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:26,975
- Oh, pooh.
- Or used to be.

308
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:29,343
Now you do
dog food commercials.

309
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:33,441
- Well, a man has to eat.
- What, dog food?

310
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:40,342
Very, very funny.

311
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:43,641
Anyway, they do say that
at Madame Kozlova's,

312
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,543
all your dreams come true.

313
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,175
So, if you had one wish
tonight, what would it be?

314
00:15:48,177 --> 00:15:49,641
Oh, that's easy.

315
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:51,774
I'd like to get my Aunt Lucy
a birthday present.

316
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:53,243
- Aww.
- Aww. Darling.

317
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,808
I've got my eye on
an old pop-up book of London.

318
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,410
Made by Madame Kozlova,
as it happens.

319
00:15:58,412 --> 00:16:00,543
The only problem is
it's rather expensive.

320
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:03,209
So I need to get my paws on
an awful lot of money.

321
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:05,740
Well, I'm not sure that
we can offer you that.

322
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:08,008
But we can of course
offer you

323
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,342
oodles of fun.

324
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,708
So, if you would like to
lend me a paw,

325
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:15,408
we now declare
Kozlova's Steam Fair

326
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,574
open!

327
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,475
Thank you,
thank you very much.

328
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:22,777
Wonderful, thank you.

329
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:27,574
- Mrs. Brown?
- Just one moment.

330
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:29,476
- A word in your ear.
- Hmm?

331
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:31,775
This, er, this pop-up book.

332
00:16:31,777 --> 00:16:33,707
- Do you know it?
- I know of it.

333
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:35,675
But I was led to believe
it was lost.

334
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:37,442
Where on earth
did you find it?

335
00:16:37,444 --> 00:16:39,342
Oh, at Mr. Gruber's
Antique Shop.

336
00:16:39,344 --> 00:16:41,309
He's keeping it to one side
for me,

337
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:42,976
but I really need a job.

338
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:46,409
I don't suppose you have
any advice, do you?

339
00:16:46,411 --> 00:16:48,442
No. No. No.

340
00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:49,841
I imagine you just have to

341
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,609
start at the bottom
of the ladder

342
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,441
and work your way up.

343
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:55,208
Do you know what,
Mr. Buchanan?

344
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,475
Hmm?

345
00:16:56,477 --> 00:16:58,874
You've just given me
the most brilliant idea.

346
00:16:58,876 --> 00:16:59,808
Have I?

347
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,010
I'm going to be
a window cleaner.

348
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:24,045
Hmm...

349
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,411
Ah.

350
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:46,911
Ah.

351
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,077
Hmm?

352
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,444
Oh... Oh, dear.

353
00:18:03,743 --> 00:18:04,810
Um...

354
00:18:14,278 --> 00:18:15,477
Hmm...

355
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:18,042
Ow.

356
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,311
Hello? Anyone?

357
00:18:46,677 --> 00:18:47,678
Hmm?

358
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:58,676
- Hello? Window cleaner.
- No, thank you.

359
00:18:58,678 --> 00:19:01,309
Sure, Colonel?
They're awfully dirty.

360
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:04,276
I don't care
and I'm not paying.

361
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:06,507
Perhaps I'll do them anyway.

362
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,675
Good afternoon, Colonel.

363
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:57,375
Are you aware
there's a bear on your roof?

364
00:19:57,377 --> 00:19:59,841
Yes, he seems to be
cleaning my windows.

365
00:19:59,843 --> 00:20:02,241
Shall I do your gutters
while I'm up here?

366
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,141
Um, yes. Thank you.

367
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:07,908
Well, of course it's not
for me to say, Colonel,

368
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,308
but I wouldn't care to have
an undesirable

369
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,075
crawling all over my premises.

370
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,574
And as Commander of your
Community Defense Force...

371
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:16,876
Is that an official position,
Mr. Curry?

372
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:19,743
Or have you just bought
yourself a yellow coat?

373
00:20:21,911 --> 00:20:23,710
Got my eye on you, bear.

374
00:20:24,744 --> 00:20:27,143
Oh. Sorry.

375
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:29,574

386
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:31,208
One more day, Aunt Lucy.

387
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,444
Hmm?

388
00:21:38,943 --> 00:21:40,077
Mr. Gruber?

389
00:21:40,677 --> 00:21:41,573
Eh?

390
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:42,908
You're not Mr. Gruber!

391
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,677
- Clear off!
- Oh, no, you don't.

392
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:59,909
Stop! Thief!

393
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:04,208
Come back with that book!

394
00:22:05,577 --> 00:22:07,641
Robbery in progress
at Gruber's Antiques.

395
00:22:07,643 --> 00:22:09,675
Suspect is
a small bear wearing

396
00:22:09,677 --> 00:22:11,778
a red hat
and blue duffle coat.

397
00:22:13,843 --> 00:22:14,843
Stop!

398
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,510
Come back!

399
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:23,343
No!

400
00:22:31,944 --> 00:22:33,678
Come on, Wolfie.

401
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:42,575
Oi!

402
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:45,008
- Oi! Get off it!
- Give that back!

403
00:22:46,643 --> 00:22:48,109
No!

404
00:22:48,111 --> 00:22:50,844
- Nice try, bear.
- Whoa, Wolfie.

405
00:22:53,743 --> 00:22:55,241
Toodle-oo.

406
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:57,141
Oh. Um...

407
00:23:00,276 --> 00:23:01,743
Giddy-up!

408
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:04,477
Ow.

409
00:23:05,477 --> 00:23:07,011
Come on, boy.

410
00:23:14,043 --> 00:23:17,543
Excuse me. Coming through.
Who are you?

411
00:23:19,744 --> 00:23:21,308
Oh, dear.

412
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,443
Strike a light! Oh!

413
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:29,009
That book is reserved
for Aunt Lucy!

414
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:32,141
Hello there.

415
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:33,941
Oh! Ow. Not the snout!

416
00:23:33,943 --> 00:23:35,441
Wolfie!

417
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,778
Thank you, Wolfie.
Come on. Attaboy.

418
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:50,474
All right, all right.
You got me.

419
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:51,909
Hand over that book.

420
00:23:51,911 --> 00:23:54,511
'Fraid I can't do that.
Cheerio.

421
00:23:56,744 --> 00:23:58,744
But

422
00:23:59,944 --> 00:24:01,674
where did he go?

423
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:03,507
Hold it right there.

424
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,542
Oh, thank goodness
you're here, Officer.

425
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,675
Put your... paws in the air.

426
00:24:07,677 --> 00:24:09,942
But I'm not the thief.

427
00:24:09,944 --> 00:24:13,408
I was chasing the thief.
And then he... He...

428
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,507
Disappeared in
a puff of smoke?

429
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:18,311
Well, yes.

430
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:37,274
- Paddington!
- Oh, no!

431
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:38,875
- What's going on?
- Hold it there.

432
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,508
Hang on. Hang on. We're
taking him into custody.

433
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,508
- There must be some mistake.
- No mistake, sir.

434
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,742
What's happened?

435
00:24:43,744 --> 00:24:45,441
- Caught red-handed.
- What?

436
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:47,009
Robbing Gruber's Antiques.

437
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:51,408
Well, well, well.
The truth is out.

438
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,174
We opened our hearts
to that bear,

439
00:24:54,176 --> 00:24:55,875
we opened our doors.

440
00:24:55,877 --> 00:24:58,540
Well, you did.
I kept mine triple locked

441
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:00,542
in accordance
with the guidelines.

442
00:25:00,544 --> 00:25:05,009
And all along,
he was robbing you blind.

443
00:25:06,143 --> 00:25:07,411
Paddington!

444
00:25:08,443 --> 00:25:10,776
- Oh, no!
- Paddington!

445
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:12,443
Oh, dear!

446
00:25:16,676 --> 00:25:19,807
A nice little haul,
and no mistake.

447
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,007
Turned out to be quite
a stroke of luck,

448
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:24,575
that bear turning up
when he did.

449
00:25:24,577 --> 00:25:27,911
Coppers think he done it.
We're in the clear.

450
00:25:31,075 --> 00:25:33,474
Indeed, Magwitch.

451
00:25:33,476 --> 00:25:36,508
And we gave quite
a performance, you and I.

452
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,443
Just like the old days.

453
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,675
Why the lemon face, Hamlet?

454
00:25:42,677 --> 00:25:44,341
If you have something to say,

455
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,407
I beg you,
share it with us all.

456
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:48,941
It is not,
nor it cannot come to good.

457
00:25:48,943 --> 00:25:51,774
Oh, really. You and your
dreary conscience.

458
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:53,707
Tell me this.
Which would you rather?

459
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:56,040
That you stand here,
gathering dust

460
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:57,842
while I humiliate myself

461
00:25:57,844 --> 00:26:00,475
in a spaniel's costume
on television

462
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:03,108
or that we all return in glory

463
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,808
in the greatest one-man show

464
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,307
the West End has ever seen?

465
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:12,741
Oh, thank you, my darlings.
Thank you. Thank you.

466
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:17,642
Blessings upon you all.
Deepest of bows. Thank you.

467
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:19,274
I know what you're thinking,
Scrooge.

468
00:26:19,276 --> 00:26:20,440
It will cost a fortune,

469
00:26:20,442 --> 00:26:21,841
but if I'm right,

470
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:25,407
that is exactly
what this book will provide.

471
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:28,341
This is no dusty antique.

472
00:26:28,343 --> 00:26:30,274
Hidden on every page,

473
00:26:30,276 --> 00:26:33,008
a little lady
pointing to a clue.

474
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:38,342
Find all the clues,
we're rich again,

475
00:26:38,344 --> 00:26:41,644
and our dog food days
are done.

476
00:26:42,943 --> 00:26:45,141
<i>Dinner is served, Master.</i>

477
00:26:45,143 --> 00:26:46,609
<i>Thank you, Simkins.</i>

478
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:50,808
<i>If, like me, your doggie likes
to maintain standards,</i>

479
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,842
<i>can I recommend
Harley's Gourmet Dindins.</i>

480
00:26:53,844 --> 00:26:57,440
<i>More taste,
more goodness, more,</i>

481
00:26:57,442 --> 00:27:00,175
<i>dare one say, class.</i>

482
00:27:00,177 --> 00:27:01,474
<i>Mmm.</i>

483
00:27:01,476 --> 00:27:03,307
<i>Harley's Gourmet Dog Food.</i>

484
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:05,510
- <i>Woof.</i>
- <i>Not to be consumed by humans.</i>

485
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:09,074
Court will rise.

486
00:27:09,076 --> 00:27:12,173
Deep breath, Paddington.
Remember what Mr. Brown said.

487
00:27:12,175 --> 00:27:15,842
"You're young. You've done
nothing wrong. You'll be fine.

488
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:18,507
"So long as you get
a fair-minded judge."

489
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:20,976
Order! O... Order.

490
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:26,274
Oh, dear.

491
00:27:26,276 --> 00:27:29,909
You'll now hear the case of
the Crown versus Paddington

492
00:27:30,377 --> 00:27:31,841
Brown.

493
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:35,307
Oh, yes, he loved the book.

494
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:37,475
His heart was set
on top of it.

495
00:27:37,477 --> 00:27:40,674
So you discussed
how expensive it was?

496
00:27:40,676 --> 00:27:43,775
Yes, but he was earning
the money.

497
00:27:43,777 --> 00:27:46,742
I refuse to believe that
young Mr. Brown

498
00:27:46,744 --> 00:27:48,841
would ever burglarize my shop.

499
00:27:48,843 --> 00:27:50,741
Exactly.

500
00:27:50,743 --> 00:27:52,141
Paw prints were found

501
00:27:52,143 --> 00:27:55,708
here, here, and here.

502
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,677
And a substance, later
identified as marmalade,

503
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:01,241
was found here.

504
00:28:01,243 --> 00:28:04,376
And is this
the same marmalade?

505
00:28:10,476 --> 00:28:11,808
Yes, it is.

506
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,007
Phoenix Buchanan, do you
swear to tell the truth,

507
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:17,241
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

508
00:28:17,243 --> 00:28:19,674
May my entrails
be plucked forth

509
00:28:19,676 --> 00:28:23,475
and wound about my neck
should I deceive.

510
00:28:23,477 --> 00:28:26,907
I do.
Prison is no laughing matter.

511
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:30,841
And I should know, I spent
three years in <i>Les Misérables.</i>

512
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,207
Mr. Buchanan,
you live on the same street

513
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:36,774
- as the defendant?
- I do.

514
00:28:36,776 --> 00:28:40,408
And you were an eye witness
to the events that night?

515
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,173
Indeed I was.

516
00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:45,440
I was up late, when I became
aware of a hullabaloo

517
00:28:45,442 --> 00:28:46,840
in the street below.

518
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:50,642
I went to my awards room,
which is a large room

519
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:52,541
overlooking
the newspaper kiosk,

520
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:54,742
and I saw young Paddington

521
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:58,173
riding a rather
disreputable-looking hound.

522
00:28:58,175 --> 00:29:00,208
Mary Brown drew this

523
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,776
based on
the bear's description

524
00:29:01,778 --> 00:29:04,442
of the man he claims
he was chasing.

525
00:29:04,444 --> 00:29:07,775
Did you see him on the street
that night?

526
00:29:07,777 --> 00:29:10,441
Oh, a handsome devil,
isn't he? Hmm?

527
00:29:10,443 --> 00:29:13,874
- Dazzling eyes.
- Yes, but did you see him?

528
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:18,040
Your answer will tell us
whether the bear is guilty.

529
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:19,644
Did you see this man?

530
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:21,744
Alas,

531
00:29:22,842 --> 00:29:23,941
I did not.

532
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:27,074
But perhaps
he'd already vanished.

533
00:29:27,076 --> 00:29:31,311
I beg you, have mercy on him.
He is but a cub.

534
00:29:33,142 --> 00:29:35,442
Paddington Brown.

535
00:29:35,444 --> 00:29:38,908
Ten years for grand theft...

536
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,240
Oh, but, I...

537
00:29:40,242 --> 00:29:44,009
...and grievous barberly harm.

538
00:29:46,277 --> 00:29:48,678
Follow me.

539
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:15,841
Oh, um...

540
00:30:15,843 --> 00:30:18,208
Mrs. Brown usually reads me
a story before bed.

541
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,541
I don't suppose...

542
00:30:19,543 --> 00:30:22,741
Sorry, son.
No bedtime stories in here.

543
00:30:22,743 --> 00:30:23,810
Oh.

544
00:30:42,243 --> 00:30:44,275
<i>Dear Aunt Lucy.</i>

545
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:47,707
<i>A great deal has happened
since I last wrote.</i>

546
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:50,874
<i>There's been a bit of a mix-up
with your present,</i>

547
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:52,773
<i>and the upshot is
I've had to leave</i>

548
00:30:52,775 --> 00:30:55,408
<i>Windsor Gardens and move</i>

549
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,806
<i>somewhere else.</i>

550
00:30:57,808 --> 00:31:01,008
<i>It isn't quite as charming
as the Browns' house,</i>

551
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,607
<i>but it's not all bad.</i>

552
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:04,774
<i>It's a period property.</i>

553
00:31:04,776 --> 00:31:06,774
<i>In fact, it's one of
the most substantial</i>

554
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:09,140
<i>Victorian buildings
in London,</i>

555
00:31:09,142 --> 00:31:11,007
<i>and the security arrangements</i>

556
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:12,906
<i>are second to none.</i>

557
00:31:12,908 --> 00:31:15,842
<i>I'm only allowed to see
the Browns once a month.</i>

558
00:31:16,776 --> 00:31:19,343
<i>I wonder
what they're doing now.</i>

559
00:31:44,443 --> 00:31:46,910
<i>I do hope
they don't forget me.</i>

560
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:49,973
Of course they won't,
Paddington.

561
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,474
This is the Browns
you're talking about.

562
00:31:52,476 --> 00:31:54,041
<i>They'll sort everything out,</i>

563
00:31:54,043 --> 00:31:56,907
<i>and I'll be able to go home
and get your present,</i>

564
00:31:56,909 --> 00:31:59,776
<i>and everything will be
right as rain.</i>

565
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:03,610
I just need to hold on
till then.

566
00:32:43,676 --> 00:32:44,677
D.

567
00:32:50,277 --> 00:32:52,076
The hunt begins.

568
00:32:57,276 --> 00:33:02,573
325, 326, 327...

569
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:05,207
Here goes, Paddington.
Manners.

570
00:33:05,209 --> 00:33:06,542
Fall in.

571
00:33:07,243 --> 00:33:08,673
Good morning.

572
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:10,207
How would you like to start
a gardening club?

573
00:33:10,209 --> 00:33:14,407
How would you like to be
buried in a very deep hole?

574
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,674
After you.

575
00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:17,876
Spooner, R. Workshop.

576
00:33:19,376 --> 00:33:22,841
Brown, P. Laundry duty.

577
00:33:22,843 --> 00:33:24,907
Right, laundry.

578
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:26,442
Laundry, laundry?

579
00:33:26,444 --> 00:33:27,977
Ah! Laundry!

580
00:33:45,842 --> 00:33:47,043
Ugh!

581
00:33:52,342 --> 00:33:53,610
Oh!

582
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,706
Oh, it's only one red sock.

583
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,076
What's the worst
that can happen?

584
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:26,340
Afternoon, chaps.

585
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:31,308
If you ask me, the pink really
brightens the place up a bit.

586
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:35,607
If you ask me, you should pipe
down and enjoy your dinner,

587
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:37,843
because it might be
your last.

588
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,473
Okay.

589
00:34:56,276 --> 00:34:57,908
Ugh.

590
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,673
Don't worry. I used to be
a restaurant critic.

591
00:35:00,675 --> 00:35:02,809
- It's not as bad as it looks.
- Oh.

592
00:35:04,475 --> 00:35:06,275
It's worse.

593
00:35:06,277 --> 00:35:08,240
What is this?

594
00:35:08,242 --> 00:35:09,573
Nobody knows.

595
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:11,975
But we've been eating it
three times a day

596
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,640
for the past ten years.

597
00:35:13,642 --> 00:35:14,907
Why doesn't someone have

598
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:17,340
a word with the chef?

599
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:20,208
With Knuckles?

600
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,140
Two things to remember if you
want to survive in here.

601
00:35:23,142 --> 00:35:27,007
Keep your head down
and never talk to Knuckles.

602
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:27,974
Thank you.

603
00:35:27,976 --> 00:35:30,140
Well I think
it's a great idea.

604
00:35:30,142 --> 00:35:31,441
Tell you what, son,

605
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:33,573
you get Knuckles to change
the menu and

606
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:35,574
we might forget about you
making us

607
00:35:35,576 --> 00:35:38,107
look like
a bunch of pink flamingos.

608
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:41,073
- All right then, I will.
- You don't wanna

609
00:35:41,075 --> 00:35:42,707
- do that.
- Aunt Lucy said,

610
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:45,439
"If you look for the good
in people, you'll find it."

611
00:35:45,441 --> 00:35:47,876
She obviously
never met Knuckles.

612
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:55,810
Um, excuse me.

613
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:58,475
Mr. Knuckles?

614
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:00,275
Yes?

615
00:36:00,277 --> 00:36:01,708
I just wondered
if I could have

616
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,508
a quick word about the food?

617
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,041
Send a medic to the canteen.

618
00:36:06,043 --> 00:36:07,843
You want to

619
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:10,341
complain?

620
00:36:10,343 --> 00:36:12,308
Oh, no,
I wouldn't say complain.

621
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,707
Oh, that's a shame.

622
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:17,643
Because I just love it
when people complain.

623
00:36:18,408 --> 00:36:20,475
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

624
00:36:20,943 --> 00:36:22,041
Oh.

625
00:36:22,043 --> 00:36:24,708
Well, in that case,
it's very gritty.

626
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,440
- Oh.
- And lumpy.

627
00:36:26,442 --> 00:36:27,908
And as for the bread...

628
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,673
Need I say more?

629
00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:33,440
I think we need to completely
overhaul the menu.

630
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:35,041
Now I know we're working to
a tight budget,

631
00:36:35,043 --> 00:36:37,108
but we could at least
add some sauce.

632
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:41,407
Oh. Sorry about that.
I'll just...

633
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:44,240
Hmm. No,
that's just rubbing it in.

634
00:36:45,742 --> 00:36:48,442
Don't worry. I know
what gets ketchup stains out.

635
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:52,076
Hang on, was it mustard?

636
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:55,340
No.

637
00:36:55,342 --> 00:36:57,373
That's just made it worse!

638
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:59,876
Does anyone know
what works on ketchup?

639
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:01,576
Chaps?

640
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:07,975
Forget the medic.
Better send a priest.

641
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,906
You listen to me,
you little maggot.

642
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:11,074
Listening.

643
00:37:11,076 --> 00:37:13,574
Nobody criticizes my food!

644
00:37:13,576 --> 00:37:14,907
- Right.
- Nobody

645
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:17,740
squirts condiments
on my apron.

646
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:19,441
- Got it.
- And nobody

647
00:37:19,443 --> 00:37:22,341
bonks me on the head
with a baguette.

648
00:37:22,343 --> 00:37:23,573
No bonking.

649
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,706
I'll overhaul
the menu all right.

650
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,373
- Really?
- Dish of the day.

651
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:28,075
- Yes?
- Bear pie.

652
00:37:28,077 --> 00:37:29,843
I don't like it.

653
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:48,207
What is this?

654
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:50,642
It's a marmalade sandwich.

655
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:52,774
Marmalade?

656
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:55,474
My Aunt Lucy taught me
to make them.

657
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:57,608
You mean, you can make this?

658
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:01,541
- Well, yes.
- Stand aside.

659
00:38:01,543 --> 00:38:06,207
Get up off the floor,
you bunch of yellow-bellies!

660
00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:07,875
Listen to me.

661
00:38:07,877 --> 00:38:09,306
This bear is now

662
00:38:09,308 --> 00:38:11,207
- under my protection.
- Oh.

663
00:38:11,209 --> 00:38:14,240
Anyone who touches a hair
on his back

664
00:38:14,242 --> 00:38:17,606
will answer
to Knuckles McGinty.

665
00:38:17,608 --> 00:38:20,676
That's Knuckles with
a capital 'N.'

666
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,941
- Thank you, Mr. McGinty.
- Don't thank me yet.

667
00:38:25,943 --> 00:38:29,475
I don't do nothin'
for no one for nothin'.

668
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:31,973
Beg your pardon?

669
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:33,875
You get my protection

670
00:38:33,877 --> 00:38:37,443
so long as you make
that marmalade. Deal?

671
00:38:40,075 --> 00:38:41,943
Deal.

672
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:51,340
Somebody's got to recognize
him sooner or later.

673
00:38:53,175 --> 00:38:54,941
You all right, Mr. Gruber?

674
00:38:54,943 --> 00:38:56,940
There's something about
this whole business

675
00:38:56,942 --> 00:38:58,841
that has been tickling
my brainbox.

676
00:38:58,843 --> 00:39:00,175
What is it?

677
00:39:00,177 --> 00:39:01,975
On the night of the robbery,

678
00:39:01,977 --> 00:39:03,874
when young Mr. Brown
called out,

679
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:06,974
<i>the thief took to his heels
and ran down the stairs.</i>

680
00:39:06,976 --> 00:39:08,774
<i>Came straight through
the shop</i>

681
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:11,641
<i>and out the front door,
setting off the alarm.</i>

682
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:14,640
Ah. But that's the thing.
He didn't go straight through

683
00:39:14,642 --> 00:39:16,008
- the shop.
- No?

684
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,506
<i>He came all the way
over here</i>

685
00:39:17,508 --> 00:39:18,906
<i>to get the popping book.</i>

686
00:39:18,908 --> 00:39:21,874
<i>Why not some jewelry
or a vase?</i>

687
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:24,606
They're much closer.
Far more valuable.

688
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:26,640
He can't know much
about antiques.

689
00:39:26,642 --> 00:39:27,743
No.

690
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,074
Unless

691
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:33,742
he knows something about
that book that we don't.

692
00:39:35,543 --> 00:39:38,407
You may find this hard
to believe, Madame Kozlova,

693
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,874
but Paddington is innocent.

694
00:39:39,876 --> 00:39:41,674
And we think that
the real thief

695
00:39:41,676 --> 00:39:43,106
may have broken
into Mr Gruber's

696
00:39:43,108 --> 00:39:45,808
just to steal your
great-grandmother's pop-up book.

697
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:49,273
- The pop-up book?
- I know it sounds far-fetched.

698
00:39:49,275 --> 00:39:51,474
But is there anything you could
tell us about that book?

699
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:53,543
Anything at all
could be helpful.

700
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:57,910
- That's quite a story.
- Oh, really?

701
00:39:59,242 --> 00:40:00,875
Come with me.

702
00:40:00,877 --> 00:40:03,839
I'll show you
where it all happened.

703
00:40:03,841 --> 00:40:08,007
You see, my great-grandmother,
who started this fair,

704
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:11,340
<i>was the finest show woman
of her generation.</i>

705
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:15,506
<i>She could tame lions,
breathe fire, swallow swords,</i>

706
00:40:15,508 --> 00:40:20,641
<i>but she was most famous
for the trapeze.</i>

707
00:40:20,643 --> 00:40:23,873
<i>They called her
the "Flying Swan."</i>

708
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:27,340
<i>Wherever she went,
she was showered with gifts,</i>

709
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,975
<i>and made a fortune.</i>

710
00:40:28,977 --> 00:40:34,406
<i>But where there is a fortune,
there is also jealousy.</i>

711
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:38,206
<i>The magician
wanted it for himself.</i>

712
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:39,943
<i>And the "Flying Swan"...</i>

713
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:46,573
<i>...became the "Dying Swan."</i>

714
00:40:46,575 --> 00:40:50,410
<i>He went to her caravan
and opened her strongbox.</i>

715
00:40:51,543 --> 00:40:53,673
<i>But instead of her treasure,</i>

716
00:40:53,675 --> 00:40:57,807
<i>all he found was
one of her pop-up books:</i>

717
00:40:57,809 --> 00:41:01,007
<i>Twelve Landmarks of London.</i>

718
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:04,542
<i>They had him cornered,
but he vanished.</i>

719
00:41:05,676 --> 00:41:08,540
<i>And neither he,
nor the treasure,</i>

720
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:10,843
<i>were ever heard of again.</i>

721
00:41:11,976 --> 00:41:13,506
I knew
there was something special

722
00:41:13,508 --> 00:41:15,106
- about that pop-up book.
- Hmm?

723
00:41:15,108 --> 00:41:17,841
Well, why else would she have
kept it in her strongbox?

724
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:20,074
You're not telling me you
believed all that guff, are you?

725
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:23,406
Madame Kozlova drew 12 London
landmarks in that book.

726
00:41:23,408 --> 00:41:24,640
Yes?

727
00:41:24,642 --> 00:41:26,007
Well, what if they're not
just landmarks.

728
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:28,676
What if they're...
I don't know...

729
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,407
- ...clues!
- Clues?

730
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:34,306
- To where she hid her fortune.
- You mean a treasure map?

731
00:41:34,308 --> 00:41:35,740
Exactly!

732
00:41:35,742 --> 00:41:38,139
And that's why the thief
took it from Mr Gruber's.

733
00:41:38,141 --> 00:41:41,140
First thing tomorrow we need to go
to every landmark in that book,

734
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:44,007
see if we can sniff out
anything suspicious.

735
00:41:44,009 --> 00:41:46,007
Too many adventure stories,
Mary.

736
00:41:46,009 --> 00:41:47,106
What?

737
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:48,406
She's a fortune-teller.

738
00:41:48,408 --> 00:41:50,806
She spun you a yarn.
It's what they do.

739
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:53,073
Honestly, Henry, you're
so close-minded these days.

740
00:41:53,075 --> 00:41:54,340
What's that supposed to mean?

741
00:41:54,342 --> 00:41:56,507
What happened to the man
I married?

742
00:41:56,509 --> 00:41:57,640
He'd have believed me.

743
00:41:57,642 --> 00:42:00,673
- Oh, him. He's gone.
- What?

744
00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:02,975
I'm afraid your husband's
just a creaky old man,

745
00:42:02,977 --> 00:42:05,741
he's not Bullseye Brown.

746
00:42:05,743 --> 00:42:08,609
<i>♪ I'm crazy like a fool</i>

747
00:42:09,643 --> 00:42:12,375
<i>♪ What about Daddy Cool?</i>

748
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:15,977
<i>♪ Daddy, Daddy Cool</i>

749
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:19,741
<i>♪ Daddy, Daddy Cool</i>

750
00:42:19,743 --> 00:42:20,974
Bullseye.

751
00:42:20,976 --> 00:42:22,441
Oh, Henry.

752
00:42:22,443 --> 00:42:24,473
<i>She's crazy about her daddy</i>

753
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,607
Henry? Henry!

754
00:42:26,609 --> 00:42:27,874
Anyway, the point is,

755
00:42:27,876 --> 00:42:29,307
we're not going to
help Paddington

756
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:30,741
by going on
a wild goose chase.

757
00:42:30,743 --> 00:42:32,474
We're looking for this
scruffy chancer,

758
00:42:32,476 --> 00:42:34,273
not some
swashbuckling pirate

759
00:42:34,275 --> 00:42:36,641
hunting for buried treasure.

760
00:42:36,643 --> 00:42:39,940
I think there's more to him
than meets the eye.

761
00:42:39,942 --> 00:42:41,706
I think he somehow knew
the story

762
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,641
of the Kozlova fortune

763
00:42:43,643 --> 00:42:46,576
<i>and is out there right now
trying to find it.</i>

764
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:49,606
Well, Grandfather,

765
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:54,539
tonight we go in search
of clue number two.

766
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:58,441
The setting,
St. Paul's Cathedral.

767
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:00,910
<i>But how to slip in unobserved?</i>

768
00:43:01,609 --> 00:43:04,709
<i>Enter Sister Isabella.</i>

769
00:43:14,742 --> 00:43:17,873
Wakey-wakey.

770
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:19,676
Marmalade time.

771
00:43:21,576 --> 00:43:24,774
There you go, lads.
Good luck.

772
00:43:24,776 --> 00:43:27,807
- Um, Mr. McGinty...
- What do you want?

773
00:43:27,809 --> 00:43:30,775
Well, the thing is,
I'm actually innocent.

774
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:32,574
And I wondered
if you had any advice

775
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:34,807
on how to clear my name?
Now that we're friends.

776
00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:38,307
Friends? I'm
your boss, not your buddy.

777
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:40,841
Oh. Well, after you.

778
00:43:40,843 --> 00:43:43,973
Why? So you can stab me
in the back?

779
00:43:43,975 --> 00:43:46,473
No. Because it's polite.

780
00:43:46,475 --> 00:43:48,540
Aunt Lucy said,
"If we're kind and polite,

781
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,072
"the world will be right."

782
00:43:50,074 --> 00:43:52,306
You were ahead of me
and now you're behind.

783
00:43:52,308 --> 00:43:53,609
That makes you a sap.

784
00:43:54,742 --> 00:43:57,739
- Ingredients are over there.
- Um...

785
00:43:57,741 --> 00:44:01,106
- Aren't you going to help?
- Nope. Now get on with it.

786
00:44:01,108 --> 00:44:03,973
But there's 500 hungry prisoners
coming for breakfast,

787
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,373
so we'll need
1,000 juicy oranges and...

788
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:09,707
Oh, and rule number one:
no talking.

789
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:18,606
Rule number two:

790
00:44:18,608 --> 00:44:20,972
- no humming or singing...
- But... I...

791
00:44:20,974 --> 00:44:24,941
...or any other expression
of bonhomie.

792
00:44:44,209 --> 00:44:46,773
Ooh, that's heavy.

793
00:44:46,775 --> 00:44:48,876
Come on,
put your back into it.

794
00:44:51,876 --> 00:44:52,909
Help.

795
00:44:55,643 --> 00:44:57,340
These sacks are awfully heavy.

796
00:44:57,342 --> 00:44:59,273
Well, take them
one at a time, then.

797
00:44:59,275 --> 00:45:01,941
Right. One at a... time.

798
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:11,076
One juicy orange.

799
00:45:15,643 --> 00:45:17,643
Two juicy oranges.

800
00:45:21,074 --> 00:45:22,941
Three juicy oranges.

801
00:45:24,576 --> 00:45:28,039
- Now what are you doing?
- Taking them one at a time.

802
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:29,940
One sack at a time!

803
00:45:29,942 --> 00:45:33,473
I'm sorry, I'm finding this a very
stressful working environment.

804
00:45:33,475 --> 00:45:34,940
Aunt Lucy said...

805
00:45:34,942 --> 00:45:37,239
Aunt Lucy! I've had it up to
here with Aunt Lucy!

806
00:45:37,241 --> 00:45:38,640
She sounds like

807
00:45:38,642 --> 00:45:40,743
a proper old bag to me.

808
00:45:42,408 --> 00:45:44,709
I beg your pardon?

809
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,073
I said,

810
00:45:47,075 --> 00:45:51,773
your Aunt Lucy sounds like
one of the most naive,

811
00:45:51,775 --> 00:45:54,642
gullible, mushy-brained...

812
00:45:55,841 --> 00:45:57,409
What's going on?

813
00:45:59,441 --> 00:46:01,409
Why are you looking at me
like that?

814
00:46:02,807 --> 00:46:06,474
It's awful hot in here.
Are you hot? I'm hot.

815
00:46:06,476 --> 00:46:08,572
Did I leave the oven on?

816
00:46:08,574 --> 00:46:11,507
It's called a hard stare.

817
00:46:11,509 --> 00:46:13,306
Aunt Lucy taught me to do them

818
00:46:13,308 --> 00:46:15,308
when people had forgotten
their manners.

819
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:17,074
You don't have to tell me
about hard stares,

820
00:46:17,076 --> 00:46:19,839
I practically invented them.

821
00:46:19,841 --> 00:46:22,174
Pretty good for a bear though,
I'll give you that.

822
00:46:22,176 --> 00:46:23,573
Now, Mr. McGinty,

823
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:25,940
I may look like
a hardened criminal to you,

824
00:46:25,942 --> 00:46:27,207
but I really am innocent.

825
00:46:27,209 --> 00:46:29,473
And if you're not going to
help me clear my name,

826
00:46:29,475 --> 00:46:32,272
you could at least help me
make this marmalade.

827
00:46:32,274 --> 00:46:34,307
All right, I'll help.

828
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:35,574
Thank you.

829
00:46:35,576 --> 00:46:37,541
Not gonna be much use
to you though.

830
00:46:37,543 --> 00:46:39,873
These weren't exactly made
for cooking.

831
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:41,073
Oh, I don't know.

832
00:46:41,075 --> 00:46:42,641
Looks to me like
you've got yourself

833
00:46:42,643 --> 00:46:44,939
a fine pair
of orange squeezers.

834
00:46:44,941 --> 00:46:46,808
Orange squeezers?

835
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:52,073
Good.

836
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,174
No.

837
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:54,307
Better.

838
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:55,440
Tomato.

839
00:46:55,442 --> 00:46:56,840
Lovely.

840
00:46:56,842 --> 00:46:59,441
Yes. Spot on.

841
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:01,640
Now, we have to be
very careful with knives.

842
00:47:01,642 --> 00:47:04,306
Aunt Lucy said that
sensible bears...

843
00:47:05,874 --> 00:47:07,640
Where on earth did you learn
to use a knife like that?

844
00:47:07,642 --> 00:47:09,609
You don't wanna know.

845
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:12,542
Well, it's jolly good.

846
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:15,806
Now?

847
00:47:15,808 --> 00:47:16,809
Now.

848
00:47:18,643 --> 00:47:21,039
- Right, it's time for the sugar.
- Okay.

849
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:23,441
That's what turns the juice
into marmalade.

850
00:47:23,443 --> 00:47:26,139
- How much?
- Ooh, a lot.

851
00:47:28,142 --> 00:47:30,140
Same again.

852
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:31,673
Ah.

853
00:47:31,675 --> 00:47:33,973
A squeeze of lemon.

854
00:47:33,975 --> 00:47:36,172
A pinch of cinnamon.

855
00:47:36,174 --> 00:47:38,907
And just a bit more sugar.

856
00:47:38,909 --> 00:47:41,439
Well, is it good?

857
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,374
Oh, it's too soon to tell.

858
00:47:43,376 --> 00:47:45,842
We'll only really know
once it's set.

859
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:49,340
Designed
by Sir Christopher Wren,

860
00:47:49,342 --> 00:47:50,640
St. Paul's Cathedral is

861
00:47:50,642 --> 00:47:52,873
one of London's
most famous landmarks.

862
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:55,705
Sadly the Great Dome is
closed to visitors today

863
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:57,274
as one of its statues

864
00:47:57,276 --> 00:48:00,174
was destroyed in a bizarre
accident last night.

865
00:48:00,176 --> 00:48:01,339
But if you follow me...

866
00:48:01,341 --> 00:48:03,373
Excuse me?
What happened here?

867
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:06,073
- A nun went berserk.
- Really?

868
00:48:06,075 --> 00:48:07,607
It happens.

869
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:10,672
The police have rounded them
all up for questioning.

870
00:48:10,674 --> 00:48:12,140
Hold it there, Sister!

871
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:15,039
You're going nowhere till
the detective says so.

872
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:16,675
Spin it around!

873
00:48:18,509 --> 00:48:21,272
Mind you, if you ask me,

874
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:23,641
the real culprit
slipped the net.

875
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:25,639
What makes you say that?

876
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:28,606
Because I saw her,
that's what.

877
00:48:28,608 --> 00:48:30,740
<i>I was on patrol
in the Upper Dome,</i>

878
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:33,307
<i>watching the nuns parade
far below,</i>

879
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:35,873
<i>when something caught
my eye.</i>

880
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:38,172
<i>One of them broke free
from the herd</i>

881
00:48:38,174 --> 00:48:40,908
<i>and made her way
to the Whispering Gallery.</i>

882
00:48:45,774 --> 00:48:48,873
<i>Only the good Lord knows
what she was doing up there.</i>

883
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:50,873
"C."

884
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:52,807
<i>But she was never gonna
get away with it.</i>

885
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:55,873
<i>Not while I'm Vice Deputy
Head of Security.</i>

886
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:56,908
Oi!

887
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,773
Attention all units.
An unusually attractive nun

888
00:49:06,775 --> 00:49:08,840
is causing mayhem
in the cathedral dome.

889
00:49:08,842 --> 00:49:12,606
<i>Activate emergency protocol.
Stop that stunning Sister.</i>

890
00:49:12,608 --> 00:49:15,974
<i>I set off at lightning speed.</i>

891
00:49:15,976 --> 00:49:18,240
<i>But by the time
we'd locked the place down,</i>

892
00:49:18,242 --> 00:49:20,206
<i>she'd vanished into the night.</i>

893
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:23,440
- Good evening, my son.
- Oh, good evening, Your Grace.

894
00:49:23,442 --> 00:49:25,407
Good evening.

895
00:49:26,842 --> 00:49:31,407
Most beautiful woman I've seen
in a long time.

896
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:34,573
Do you think you might
be able to describe her?

897
00:49:34,575 --> 00:49:37,040
It would be my pleasure.

898
00:49:41,408 --> 00:49:43,939
Gentlemen.
For breakfast this morning,

899
00:49:43,941 --> 00:49:47,538
Chef McGinty would like to
propose an orange marmalade

900
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,639
served on a bed of
warm crustless bread,

901
00:49:50,641 --> 00:49:55,409
topped with another piece
of warm crustless bread.

902
00:49:56,041 --> 00:49:57,574
Bon appetit.

903
00:49:59,675 --> 00:50:02,609
Two choices:
take it or leave it!

904
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:08,272
Are you all right, Knuckles?

905
00:50:08,274 --> 00:50:09,573
Yes!

906
00:50:09,575 --> 00:50:11,407
Why don't you come
and join the others?

907
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:12,809
Don't want to.

908
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:15,307
Are you scared
what they might think?

909
00:50:15,309 --> 00:50:16,605
No!

910
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:18,005
What do they think?
Did they like it?

911
00:50:18,007 --> 00:50:19,673
Did they say anything?
What did they say?

912
00:50:19,675 --> 00:50:22,474
- Well...
- They hated it! I knew it!

913
00:50:22,476 --> 00:50:24,473
My father always said
I'd amount to nothing,

914
00:50:24,475 --> 00:50:26,274
and he was right!

915
00:50:26,276 --> 00:50:28,207
Knuckles. Knuckles!

916
00:50:28,209 --> 00:50:29,307
What?

917
00:50:29,309 --> 00:50:30,842
Come and look.

918
00:50:33,276 --> 00:50:35,608
Mmm, mmm!

919
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:43,942
Mmm.

920
00:50:45,941 --> 00:50:46,975
Mmm.

921
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:53,075
Come on.

922
00:51:10,976 --> 00:51:12,407
Paddington.

923
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:15,505
I've a strange, warm tingle
in my tum-tum.

924
00:51:15,507 --> 00:51:18,006
I think that's called pride,
Knuckles.

925
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:19,709
Well, I don't like it.

926
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:26,008
Um, have you got
anything else?

927
00:51:27,242 --> 00:51:28,439
What?

928
00:51:28,441 --> 00:51:30,273
You know, for, um, pudding?

929
00:51:30,275 --> 00:51:31,739
- No!
- Fair enough.

930
00:51:31,741 --> 00:51:34,139
I'm afraid we only know
how to make marmalade.

931
00:51:34,141 --> 00:51:36,240
But if you have any recipes...

932
00:51:36,242 --> 00:51:38,906
This lot? You're wasting
your time there, Paddington.

933
00:51:38,908 --> 00:51:43,141
They wouldn't know their
pectin from their paprika.

934
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:47,473
Well, my grandmother used to
do a lovely chocolate roulade.

935
00:51:47,475 --> 00:51:49,207
I think
I can remember the recipe.

936
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:50,573
Oh.

937
00:51:50,575 --> 00:51:53,040
Charley Rumble makes
a mean apple crumble.

938
00:51:55,974 --> 00:51:58,572
And I can make
a strawberry panna cotta

939
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:01,172
with a pomegranate glaze.

940
00:52:01,174 --> 00:52:04,807
Oh, I like the sound of that.
Don't you, Knuckles?

941
00:52:04,809 --> 00:52:05,873
Yeah!

942
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:08,872
Come on then,
let's get cooking.

943
00:52:08,874 --> 00:52:10,406

Thank you, Phibs.

948
00:52:23,175 --> 00:52:25,572
- There you go, Paddington.
- Ooh, Knuckles.

949
00:52:25,574 --> 00:52:28,141

950
00:52:28,143 --> 00:52:30,740

- "Always use a cake fork."
- Well then.

956
00:52:50,607 --> 00:52:53,239
- Care for a taste, Warden?
- Thank you, Paddington.

957
00:52:53,241 --> 00:52:55,573

<i>You need your beauty sleep.

973
00:53:41,542 --> 00:53:42,941
Visiting day.

974
00:53:44,076 --> 00:53:46,442
I do hope you have good news.

975
00:53:51,174 --> 00:53:52,605
<i>In the past month,</i>

976
00:53:52,607 --> 00:53:55,573
these 3 shadowy individuals
have all been seen

977
00:53:55,575 --> 00:53:58,140
snooping round
3 London landmarks.

978
00:53:58,142 --> 00:53:59,440
We think
the thief you saw

979
00:53:59,442 --> 00:54:00,639
is part of a criminal gang.

980
00:54:00,641 --> 00:54:02,338
Using the pop-up book as
a treasure map.

981
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,639
Well, it's a theory.

982
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:05,073
Have you found out
who they are?

983
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,374
Not yet, dearie.

984
00:54:07,209 --> 00:54:09,639
Maybe I should take a look.

985
00:54:09,641 --> 00:54:11,905
I'm sorry, this is
a private conversation.

986
00:54:11,907 --> 00:54:13,638
Oh, it's all right,
Mr. Brown,

987
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,907
this is my friend, Knuckles.

988
00:54:14,909 --> 00:54:18,407
And this is Phibs. Spoon.
Jimmy the Snitch.

989
00:54:18,409 --> 00:54:21,406
T-Bone. The Professor.
Squeaky Pete.

990
00:54:21,408 --> 00:54:24,107
Double Bass Bob. Farmer Jack.
Mad Dog.

991
00:54:24,109 --> 00:54:26,538
Jonny Cashpoint.
Sir Geoffrey Wilcott.

992
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,240
I hope I can rely
on your vote.

993
00:54:28,242 --> 00:54:30,906
And Charley Rumble.

994
00:54:30,908 --> 00:54:33,705
Oh, it's so wonderful
to meet you all.

995
00:54:33,707 --> 00:54:35,906
I must say, it's
a great relief to know that

996
00:54:35,908 --> 00:54:39,272
Paddington's already made
such sweet friends.

997
00:54:39,274 --> 00:54:41,341
Would you excuse us a moment?

998
00:54:42,974 --> 00:54:45,940
- What are you doing?
- Talking to the nice men.

999
00:54:45,942 --> 00:54:49,539
"Nice men"? Mary,
we can't trust these people.

1000
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:51,107
I mean, look at them.

1001
00:54:51,109 --> 00:54:54,006
Talk about a rogues' gallery.
Hideous.

1002
00:54:54,008 --> 00:54:55,939
And as for that bearded baboon
in the middle,

1003
00:54:55,941 --> 00:54:58,273
he's hardly got two brain
cells to rub together.

1004
00:54:58,275 --> 00:55:01,306
We can still hear you,
Mr. Brown.

1005
00:55:02,608 --> 00:55:04,439
That was the light
you turned off.

1006
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:06,674
The microphone is on
the other side.

1007
00:55:06,676 --> 00:55:09,609
It's got "microphone"
written on it.

1008
00:55:13,007 --> 00:55:16,340
Gentlemen, if I have
offended you in any way...

1009
00:55:16,342 --> 00:55:17,473
Don't worry about it.

1010
00:55:17,475 --> 00:55:18,907
We're fond of
the little fella.

1011
00:55:18,909 --> 00:55:20,074
And let's face it,

1012
00:55:20,076 --> 00:55:23,073
if anyone can recognize
a criminal gang, it's us.

1013
00:55:24,175 --> 00:55:25,807
We'd be grateful for any help.

1014
00:55:25,809 --> 00:55:27,140
Please.

1015
00:55:27,142 --> 00:55:28,839
Well? Knuckles.

1016
00:55:28,841 --> 00:55:32,006
I'm afraid I don't recognize
any of them. Lads?

1017
00:55:32,008 --> 00:55:33,106
No.

1018
00:55:33,108 --> 00:55:34,773
I'm afraid
I couldn't possibly comment.

1019
00:55:34,775 --> 00:55:35,772
Oh.

1020
00:55:35,774 --> 00:55:37,205
Sorry to say it, kid,

1021
00:55:37,207 --> 00:55:39,073
but your friends are barking
up the wrong tree.

1022
00:55:39,075 --> 00:55:42,106
A nun, a beefeater and a king?

1023
00:55:42,108 --> 00:55:46,072
Sounds more like a fancy dress
party than a criminal gang.

1024
00:55:46,074 --> 00:55:47,673
Then,

1025
00:55:47,675 --> 00:55:49,809
what are we going to
do now?

1026
00:55:58,474 --> 00:55:59,907
Oh!

1027
00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:01,907
- Watch where you're going.
- So sorry. Sorry.

1028
00:56:01,909 --> 00:56:04,709
Sorry, I get grumpy
when I haven't had breakfast.

1029
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:09,375
Keys. Keys. Keys!

1030
00:56:10,808 --> 00:56:11,876
Bottoms!

1031
00:56:13,941 --> 00:56:15,540
You can't park here!

1032
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:17,674
I'm not parked,
I'm doing the bins.

1033
00:56:17,676 --> 00:56:20,272
You're not doing the bins,
sunshine,

1034
00:56:20,274 --> 00:56:23,238
you're studying
on council time.

1035
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,073
I'm gonna report you.

1036
00:56:25,075 --> 00:56:26,639
And your hat.

1037
00:56:26,641 --> 00:56:29,406
- Morning, Miss Kitts, Colonel.
- Oh, morning, Mrs Brown.

1038
00:56:29,408 --> 00:56:31,138
Judy asked me
to drop these off to you.

1039
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,840
Propaganda!

1040
00:56:32,842 --> 00:56:36,238
You are wasting your time
trying to peddle that rubbish.

1041
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,373
Everyone round here knows
it was your bear that done it.

1042
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:43,073
And this street is a far,
far better place without him.

1043
00:56:43,075 --> 00:56:44,538
What?

1044
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,674
Oh, it's that mangy dog!

1045
00:56:46,676 --> 00:56:49,039
You are going to the pound,
my son.

1046
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:51,072
Barking without a license
in a built-up area.

1047
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,372
Give them here, Mary.

1048
00:56:52,374 --> 00:56:53,839
I have to sell them
under the counter,

1049
00:56:53,841 --> 00:56:56,238
for obvious reasons,
but people are buying them.

1050
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,338
Really?

1051
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,106
It's a bloomin' good read.

1052
00:56:59,108 --> 00:57:00,406
Made a few people round here

1053
00:57:00,408 --> 00:57:01,805
think twice
about your young bear.

1054
00:57:01,807 --> 00:57:03,972
You just need to find
that thief.

1055
00:57:03,974 --> 00:57:06,039
Oh, we're trying.

1056
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:08,907
Don't suppose you know where
he is, do you, Feathers?

1057
00:57:08,909 --> 00:57:10,442
He's behind you.

1058
00:57:11,274 --> 00:57:12,572
Sorry, what?

1059
00:57:12,574 --> 00:57:14,173
Coo-eee!

1060
00:57:14,175 --> 00:57:16,606
- Mary?
- Oh, hello, Phoenix.

1061
00:57:16,608 --> 00:57:17,940
Why don't you come on in?

1062
00:57:17,942 --> 00:57:21,738
I want to hear all about
the investigation. Yeah?

1063
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,572
Mysterious things have been
happening all over town.

1064
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:26,739
- Oh, yes?
- Strange characters

1065
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:28,974
turning up at every landmark
in that book.

1066
00:57:28,976 --> 00:57:30,305
Are they?

1067
00:57:30,307 --> 00:57:32,338
I don't know.

1068
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,007
Perhaps
it's just a coincidence.

1069
00:57:34,009 --> 00:57:36,939
Henry says I let my imagination
get the better of me.

1070
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:39,238
Well, you're an artist, Mary,
like me.

1071
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,874
Our imaginations run free
like bison upon the plain.

1072
00:57:43,876 --> 00:57:46,440
But can I just say,
in this particular case,

1073
00:57:46,442 --> 00:57:49,172
I think dear old Henry might
have a point.

1074
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,472
Do you?

1075
00:57:50,474 --> 00:57:52,872
But I do have a little bit
of good news

1076
00:57:52,874 --> 00:57:55,306
that might turn your frown
upside down.

1077
00:57:55,308 --> 00:57:56,573
Oh, yes?

1078
00:57:56,575 --> 00:57:58,506
It looks, fingers,
fingers, fingers,

1079
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:00,071
as though the funding
may be coming through

1080
00:58:00,073 --> 00:58:01,238
for my one-man show.

1081
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,806
Oh. Right.

1082
00:58:02,808 --> 00:58:04,505
It's an evening of monologue
and song,

1083
00:58:04,507 --> 00:58:06,338
featuring some of
my better known characters.

1084
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,973
Would you like
a little preview?

1085
00:58:07,975 --> 00:58:09,406
Um...

1086
00:58:09,408 --> 00:58:14,673
Picture this scene. Darkness,
then suddenly spotlight, me,

1087
00:58:14,675 --> 00:58:15,739
ping!

1088
00:58:15,741 --> 00:58:18,540
<i>♪ Listen to
the rain on the roof</i>

1089
00:58:18,542 --> 00:58:21,706
<i>♪ go pit pitty pat,
pit pitty pat sit...</i>

1090
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:25,872
Oh, Mary, you look sad.
You don't like musicals?

1091
00:58:25,874 --> 00:58:26,940
No. No, no, no.

1092
00:58:26,942 --> 00:58:29,272
I suppose
it seems so unfair

1093
00:58:29,274 --> 00:58:31,540
Paddington is in prison
and yet

1094
00:58:31,542 --> 00:58:34,539
- life carries on.
- Oh, I know.

1095
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:38,172
It must be so hard to accept
that he won,

1096
00:58:38,174 --> 00:58:41,475
that man with the dazzling
blue eyes.

1097
00:58:43,008 --> 00:58:44,239
I beg your pardon?

1098
00:58:44,241 --> 00:58:47,506
The man in the poster.
Your wonderful drawing.

1099
00:58:47,508 --> 00:58:50,575
Yes, but... how do you know
he had blue eyes?

1100
00:58:51,107 --> 00:58:52,238
Hmm?

1101
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,374
It's just a pencil sketch.

1102
00:58:58,942 --> 00:59:00,672
Ooh.

1103
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:04,408
Well, then I must have
colored him in.

1104
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:06,606
<i>Phoenix Buchanan?</i>

1105
00:59:06,608 --> 00:59:08,706
He's a master of disguise.

1106
00:59:08,708 --> 00:59:10,874
- She's gone mad.
- Think about it, Henry.

1107
00:59:10,876 --> 00:59:13,440
Someone out there knows about
the Kozlova fortune, right?

1108
00:59:13,442 --> 00:59:15,039
Alleged fortune.

1109
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:16,906
And Knuckles said we weren't
looking for a criminal gang.

1110
00:59:16,908 --> 00:59:18,105
Knuckles?

1111
00:59:18,107 --> 00:59:19,971
- Because there was no gang.
- It was one man.

1112
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,340
Feathers knew all along.

1113
00:59:22,342 --> 00:59:24,639
- Feathers? Who's Feathers?
- Hmm?

1114
00:59:24,641 --> 00:59:26,808
The parrot at the newsstand?

1115
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:28,973
No...

1116
00:59:28,975 --> 00:59:31,273
Can we just return
to Planet Earth for a moment?

1117
00:59:31,275 --> 00:59:32,606
Phoenix Buchanan is

1118
00:59:32,608 --> 00:59:35,338
a highly respected,
award-winning actor,

1119
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,173
and a member of
our Platinum club.

1120
00:59:37,175 --> 00:59:40,172
- He is not a petty thief.
- Hang on a minute, Henry.

1121
00:59:40,174 --> 00:59:42,373
But let's just assume
I'm wrong, shall we?

1122
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,439
Okay.

1123
00:59:43,441 --> 00:59:44,740
And that the fortune-teller,

1124
00:59:44,742 --> 00:59:47,406
career criminal
and parrot are right.

1125
00:59:47,408 --> 00:59:51,139
May I remind you that you
don't actually have any proof.

1126
00:59:51,141 --> 00:59:54,709
Now, if anyone wants me,
I shall be putting up posters.

1127
00:59:56,974 --> 00:59:58,040
He's right.

1128
00:59:58,042 --> 01:00:00,773
Well, I believe you, Mary.

1129
01:00:00,775 --> 01:00:05,373
Actors are some of
the most evil, devious people

1130
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:06,971
on the planet.

1131
01:00:06,973 --> 01:00:10,238
- Are they?
- They lie for a living.

1132
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,472
Crikey.

1133
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:13,340
- If we're gonna catch one...
- Yes?

1134
01:00:13,342 --> 01:00:15,542
...we're gonna need
a foolproof plan.

1135
01:00:23,341 --> 01:00:25,542
Hmm?

1136
01:00:26,908 --> 01:00:29,375
- Paddington?
- Oh.

1137
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,308
Paddington.

1138
01:00:36,107 --> 01:00:37,472
Knuckles?

1139
01:00:37,474 --> 01:00:39,640
Got a proposition
for you, kid.

1140
01:00:39,642 --> 01:00:42,039
Me and the boys have
been talking, and

1141
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:43,339
seems to us,

1142
01:00:43,341 --> 01:00:45,373
if you're gonna clear
your name,

1143
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,738
you're gonna need our help.

1144
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,640
The Browns may mean well,
but...

1145
01:00:48,642 --> 01:00:51,706
It takes a thief
to catch a thief.

1146
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:53,005
Oh.

1147
01:00:53,007 --> 01:00:55,372
Now, if we could
figure a way out of here

1148
01:00:55,374 --> 01:00:56,739
and hit the streets,

1149
01:00:56,741 --> 01:00:58,672
we'd find this guy
soon enough.

1150
01:00:58,674 --> 01:01:01,672
But that would mean... escape.

1151
01:01:01,674 --> 01:01:04,372
It certainly would.
And we got a plan.

1152
01:01:04,374 --> 01:01:07,338
But it's a four-man job,
so we need your help.

1153
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,938
What do you say, kid?

1154
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,806
It's very kind of you,
Knuckles,

1155
01:01:10,808 --> 01:01:12,605
but I don't think
Aunt Lucy would like

1156
01:01:12,607 --> 01:01:15,506
the idea of us breaking out
of prison.

1157
01:01:15,508 --> 01:01:17,772
The Browns will find
the real thief.

1158
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,938
I just need to be patient.

1159
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,639
You may not wanna hear this,
kid,

1160
01:01:22,641 --> 01:01:26,741
but sooner or later
the Browns, well,

1161
01:01:27,407 --> 01:01:29,271
they'll forget you.

1162
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:31,072
They always do.

1163
01:01:31,074 --> 01:01:35,205
They'll miss one visit.
Then two.

1164
01:01:35,207 --> 01:01:37,972
Before you know it,

1165
01:01:37,974 --> 01:01:40,773
you won't have a home
to go back to.

1166
01:01:40,775 --> 01:01:44,240
You're wrong, Knuckles.
You're all wrong.

1167
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,939
The Browns aren't like that.

1168
01:01:45,941 --> 01:01:49,139
They'll come tomorrow
and they'll have good news,

1169
01:01:49,141 --> 01:01:50,508
you'll see.

1170
01:01:56,574 --> 01:01:58,005
<i>Hello?</i>

1171
01:01:58,007 --> 01:02:00,206
It's Judy Brown
from the <i>Portobello Express.</i>

1172
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:01,672
<i>Come in.</i>

1173
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:04,707
So what's this for, darlings?
School newspaper?

1174
01:02:04,709 --> 01:02:06,774
Yes. We thought the agent
of the Phoenix Buchanan

1175
01:02:06,776 --> 01:02:08,073
would be really interesting.

1176
01:02:08,075 --> 01:02:10,440
And you'd be right.
But I've got two minutes,

1177
01:02:10,442 --> 01:02:12,072
so we better make it snappy.

1178
01:02:12,074 --> 01:02:13,372
And I've only given you that

1179
01:02:13,374 --> 01:02:15,372
because you've brought
breakfast.

1180
01:02:15,374 --> 01:02:17,609
Nice buns, by the way.

1181
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,672
Here he comes.

1182
01:02:21,674 --> 01:02:24,406
Hello, Joe. What a surprise.

1183
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:25,839
What are you doing here?

1184
01:02:25,841 --> 01:02:27,106
Oh, you know,
posting letters.

1185
01:02:27,108 --> 01:02:28,306
How's Paddington?

1186
01:02:28,308 --> 01:02:29,572
Oh, he's a tough wee bear.

1187
01:02:29,574 --> 01:02:31,640
Yeah, he is.
Well, send him my best.

1188
01:02:31,642 --> 01:02:35,409
Yes, I will.
Thank you, Joe. Bye-bye.

1189
01:02:45,574 --> 01:02:47,806
Mr. Buchanan.

1190
01:02:47,808 --> 01:02:51,006
So, when can we expect to see
Mr. Buchanan back on stage?

1191
01:02:51,008 --> 01:02:53,707
Phoenix? Oh, I wouldn't
hold your breath, darling.

1192
01:02:53,709 --> 01:02:55,672
No, no, no,
don't get me wrong.

1193
01:02:55,674 --> 01:02:57,805
He's a terrific actor,

1194
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:00,206
but there is a teensy
little problem.

1195
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:01,406
Really?

1196
01:03:01,408 --> 01:03:03,440
He won't work
with other people.

1197
01:03:03,442 --> 01:03:06,473
Thinks they dilute his talent.

1198
01:03:06,475 --> 01:03:07,973
Miss Fanshaw.

1199
01:03:07,975 --> 01:03:10,373
Oh, I must scoot.
We're having lunch

1200
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:11,938
with a big Broadway producer.

1201
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:15,075
- Oh, where are you going?
- The Ritz, darling!

1202
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:18,042
Really nice buns.

1203
01:03:26,308 --> 01:03:28,438
Well, good heavens. Come.

1204
01:03:30,174 --> 01:03:31,739
<i>The package
has been delivered.</i>

1205
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:35,306
Repeat, the package
has been delivered.

1206
01:03:35,308 --> 01:03:37,306
Barkridge's, no less.

1207
01:03:37,308 --> 01:03:40,542
Lucky, lucky Phoenix.
Whoo!

1208
01:03:45,873 --> 01:03:47,804
- Hello?
- <i>Phoenix.</i>

1209
01:03:47,806 --> 01:03:50,406
Felicity!
What a lovely surprise.

1210
01:03:50,408 --> 01:03:52,906
I was beginning to think
you'd lost my number.

1211
01:03:52,908 --> 01:03:55,807
<i>I've got two minutes,
so we better make it snappy.</i>

1212
01:03:56,409 --> 01:03:57,939
Okay.

1213
01:03:57,941 --> 01:04:00,971
<i>We're having lunch
with a big Broadway producer.</i>

1214
01:04:00,973 --> 01:04:05,606
Well, wonderful news.
Yes, yes. Where does one go?

1215
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,606
<i>The Ritz, darling!</i>

1216
01:04:07,608 --> 01:04:09,338
I am on my way.

1217
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,308
<i>Nice buns, by the way.</i>

1218
01:04:12,442 --> 01:04:13,941
I beg your pardon?

1219
01:04:16,407 --> 01:04:18,474
<i>Really nice buns.</i>

1220
01:04:20,008 --> 01:04:21,639
Thank you, darling.

1221
01:04:21,641 --> 01:04:23,639
I've never had any complaints

1222
01:04:23,641 --> 01:04:25,674
about
Mr. and Mrs. Botty-cheek.

1223
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:27,839
Yes.

1224
01:04:27,841 --> 01:04:29,708
Gloves. Keys.

1225
01:04:30,174 --> 01:04:32,338
And exit.

1226
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:45,841
Mary?

1227
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:00,675
Open the window.

1228
01:05:04,673 --> 01:05:07,238
- Hello, darling.
- Have you gone insane?

1229
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,639
I know it's Phoenix
and I'm going to prove it.

1230
01:05:09,641 --> 01:05:11,406
This is breaking and entering.

1231
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,408
We haven't broken anything.

1232
01:05:15,107 --> 01:05:17,505
Why would Phoenix want
to steal a pop-up book?

1233
01:05:17,507 --> 01:05:18,605
He's a millionaire!

1234
01:05:18,607 --> 01:05:20,006
That's where you're wrong.

1235
01:05:20,008 --> 01:05:21,472
He owes money
all over town. Look.

1236
01:05:21,474 --> 01:05:23,737
So he's got a few bills.
I mean, everyone...

1237
01:05:23,739 --> 01:05:25,804
Good grief, the man spends
a lot on face cream.

1238
01:05:25,806 --> 01:05:27,372
He hasn't got
a penny to his name.

1239
01:05:27,374 --> 01:05:30,840
Now come on. Let's find
that book and get out of here.

1240
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:37,741
Cravat.

1241
01:05:42,408 --> 01:05:44,072
- Well?
- Nothing.

1242
01:05:44,074 --> 01:05:45,506
We must be missing something.

1243
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:46,972
Unless there's nothing
to find.

1244
01:05:46,974 --> 01:05:49,073
Now can we please go?

1245
01:05:49,075 --> 01:05:51,239
- Oh. Look, Henry.
- What?

1246
01:05:51,241 --> 01:05:52,539
The carpet.

1247
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:54,305
Yes, it's lovely.
I'll order a swatch.

1248
01:05:54,307 --> 01:05:56,171
- Give me a leg-up.
- Oh...

1249
01:05:56,173 --> 01:05:57,408
Quick, quick, quick.

1250
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:02,708
Yes!

1251
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,272
A secret room.

1252
01:06:09,274 --> 01:06:12,006
- It's an attic.
- Secret attic.

1253
01:06:12,008 --> 01:06:13,606
It's an ordinary attic.

1254
01:06:13,608 --> 01:06:15,239
Every house in the street
has one.

1255
01:06:15,241 --> 01:06:17,605
I mean, look, it's just
a perfectly normal...

1256
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:19,739
Oh, my God, he's a weirdo.

1257
01:06:19,741 --> 01:06:23,875
Look, Henry. The nun.
The thief. The king.

1258
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:26,538
We were right!

1259
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,440
Sorry. "We"?

1260
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:29,773
Well, I mean, I never...

1261
01:06:32,207 --> 01:06:34,408
- Quick!
- Get down. Get down.

1262
01:06:44,174 --> 01:06:46,941
Quite frankly ravishing.

1263
01:06:49,341 --> 01:06:50,540
Hello?

1264
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:54,708
Who goes there?

1265
01:06:55,474 --> 01:06:57,409
Reveal yourself.

1266
01:07:03,175 --> 01:07:04,474
Henry?

1267
01:07:07,374 --> 01:07:09,571
Hello, Phoenix.

1268
01:07:09,573 --> 01:07:12,272
What on earth
are you doing here?

1269
01:07:12,274 --> 01:07:14,871
I might ask you
the same thing.

1270
01:07:14,873 --> 01:07:18,374
Well, I live here.
It's my house.

1271
01:07:19,008 --> 01:07:20,939
And I

1272
01:07:20,941 --> 01:07:25,372
insure it. And for our
Platinum Club members,

1273
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:28,538
we perform an annual
free home inspection

1274
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:31,139
to verify your
security arrangements.

1275
01:07:31,141 --> 01:07:32,974
In your pajamas?

1276
01:07:33,874 --> 01:07:35,072
Mmm-hmm.

1277
01:07:35,074 --> 01:07:36,738
With your wife?

1278
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,572
So that all seems
pretty secure.

1279
01:07:39,574 --> 01:07:41,305
- Oh, hello, Phoenix.
- Mary.

1280
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,173
Didn't hear you come in.

1281
01:07:43,175 --> 01:07:45,505
She helps out when we're busy.

1282
01:07:45,507 --> 01:07:48,938
Oh, well, that sounds
entirely plausible.

1283
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,805
Does it? Great.
Well, I'm delighted to say

1284
01:07:51,807 --> 01:07:53,405
that everything
seems tickety-boo.

1285
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:54,838
Wonderful.

1286
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,572
So, I'll nip back
to the office

1287
01:07:56,574 --> 01:07:58,406
and get the boys
to type that up ASAP.

1288
01:07:58,408 --> 01:07:59,839
And we'll hope
to see you soon.

1289
01:07:59,841 --> 01:08:00,938
Indeed.

1290
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:03,939
Perhaps next time
not in your pyjamas?

1291
01:08:06,007 --> 01:08:09,374
- He's such a silly one.
- Ciao, now.

1292
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:14,772
Oh, thank Larry it's there.

1293
01:08:14,774 --> 01:08:18,772
Thank Larry, Johnny and
all the ghosts of the avenue.

1294
01:08:18,774 --> 01:08:19,972
Yeah, well, that was close,

1295
01:08:19,974 --> 01:08:21,438
- weren't it?
- Aye!

1296
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,804
Too close, if you ask me.

1297
01:08:22,806 --> 01:08:24,504
Hold your nerve, MacBeth!

1298
01:08:24,506 --> 01:08:26,273
Screw your courage
to the sticking place!

1299
01:08:26,275 --> 01:08:27,839
We are so nearly there.

1300
01:08:27,841 --> 01:08:30,671
I have followed this lady
through the whole of London

1301
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:34,939
and collected every one
of her clever little clues.

1302
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:36,938
Aye. But what do they mean?

1303
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:39,537
It's just
a jumble of letters, ain't it?

1304
01:08:41,141 --> 01:08:43,272
Uh-huh.
They are not letters at all.

1305
01:08:43,274 --> 01:08:45,838
They are musical notes.

1306
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:49,906
Indeed,
Poirot. And I believe I know

1307
01:08:49,908 --> 01:08:52,775
just where to play them.

1308
01:08:55,274 --> 01:08:57,404
Hold it!

1309
01:08:57,406 --> 01:09:00,173
That is an amazing story.

1310
01:09:00,175 --> 01:09:02,971
But all you can actually prove

1311
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:05,173
is Phoenix Buchanan
keeps his old costumes.

1312
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:07,906
Bring me some hard evidence.

1313
01:09:07,908 --> 01:09:09,472
Bring me the book
with his fingerprints on,

1314
01:09:09,474 --> 01:09:11,005
and then you've got a case.

1315
01:09:11,007 --> 01:09:14,506
But until then, there's
nothing I can do. I'm sorry.

1316
01:09:14,508 --> 01:09:17,504
Where is she go...
Where's she going?

1317
01:09:17,506 --> 01:09:19,905
What do we do now?

1318
01:09:19,907 --> 01:09:21,305
I don't know.

1319
01:09:21,307 --> 01:09:24,872
Well, at least we can tell
Paddington we know who did it.

1320
01:09:24,874 --> 01:09:27,173
- Oh, no.
- What?

1321
01:09:27,175 --> 01:09:29,404
- We've missed visiting.
- Oh!

1322
01:09:29,406 --> 01:09:30,675
Paddington.

1323
01:10:58,074 --> 01:10:59,504
Paddington!

1324
01:10:59,506 --> 01:11:01,640
Aunt Lucy?

1325
01:11:09,639 --> 01:11:12,440
- Aunt Lucy!
- Paddington.

1326
01:11:15,073 --> 01:11:20,639
What are you doing here?
I thought you'd be at home.

1327
01:11:20,641 --> 01:11:23,504
I'm afraid
I don't have one anymore.

1328
01:11:23,506 --> 01:11:26,307
You see, I'm in prison.

1329
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:30,740
And even the Browns
have forgotten me.

1330
01:11:38,339 --> 01:11:39,608
Paddington?

1331
01:11:43,807 --> 01:11:45,405
Knuckles.

1332
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:48,938
Tonight's the night.
We leave at midnight.

1333
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:52,038
You wanna clear your name,
it's now or never.

1334
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:53,507
You in?

1335
01:11:54,707 --> 01:11:55,974
I'm in.

1336
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,404
Right. Time to call it
a night.

1337
01:12:00,406 --> 01:12:02,472
Not much going on here anyway.

1338
01:12:02,474 --> 01:12:05,341
They've been good
as gold recently.

1339
01:12:13,374 --> 01:12:15,008
Lights out.

1340
01:13:30,008 --> 01:13:31,042
Ah!

1341
01:13:44,172 --> 01:13:45,440
Oh, sandwiches.

1342
01:13:46,139 --> 01:13:47,805
Paddington.

1343
01:13:47,807 --> 01:13:48,807
Coming.

1344
01:14:35,573 --> 01:14:37,708
Good luck, little bear.

1345
01:14:46,906 --> 01:14:49,038
This is the life, lads.

1346
01:14:50,673 --> 01:14:52,473
Freedom!

1347
01:15:07,307 --> 01:15:08,875
Bring her down, Spoon.

1348
01:15:27,975 --> 01:15:31,671
There she is, boys.
Our ticket out of here.

1349
01:15:31,673 --> 01:15:34,674
What do you mean?
Where are we going?

1350
01:15:36,806 --> 01:15:38,437
Might as well
tell him, Knucks.

1351
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:39,738
Tell me what?

1352
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:42,439
Aren't we going to clear
my name?

1353
01:15:42,441 --> 01:15:45,738
Sorry, kid. Change of plan.

1354
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:47,137
What?

1355
01:15:47,139 --> 01:15:50,004
- We're leaving the country.
- And you're coming with us.

1356
01:15:50,006 --> 01:15:53,272
But... you lied to me.

1357
01:15:53,274 --> 01:15:57,238
Oh, hey, now,
it wasn't like that.

1358
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,839
We were doing you a favor.

1359
01:15:58,841 --> 01:16:01,537
If we told you the truth,
you'd never have come along,

1360
01:16:01,539 --> 01:16:03,405
and it's better this way.

1361
01:16:03,407 --> 01:16:08,638
We are gonna make
marmalade together.

1362
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,773
But I don't want to, Knuckles.

1363
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:13,370
I want to clear my name
and go home.

1364
01:16:13,372 --> 01:16:16,507
And you said you'd help.
You promised.

1365
01:16:21,407 --> 01:16:23,074
Sorry, kid.

1366
01:16:24,339 --> 01:16:26,871
No can do.

1367
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:28,940
Paddington!

1368
01:16:30,373 --> 01:16:32,506
Let him go.

1369
01:16:32,508 --> 01:16:34,974
If he wants to get
himself arrested,

1370
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,775
that's his choice.

1371
01:17:19,541 --> 01:17:20,938
<i>Hello.</i>

1372
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:22,505
<i>You've reached
the Brown residence.</i>

1373
01:17:22,507 --> 01:17:23,671
<i>We're not here now...</i>

1374
01:17:23,673 --> 01:17:25,271
<i>...but leave a message.</i>

1375
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:30,672
Hello, it's me. Paddington.

1376
01:17:30,674 --> 01:17:33,137
<i>I hope you don't mind
my calling.</i>

1377
01:17:33,139 --> 01:17:34,471
<i>I just wanted to let you know</i>

1378
01:17:34,473 --> 01:17:38,772
<i>I've broken out of prison
and, well,</i>

1379
01:17:38,774 --> 01:17:41,271
<i>I suppose I'm on the run.</i>

1380
01:17:41,273 --> 01:17:42,638
<i>I didn't really mean to,</i>

1381
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,037
<i>but Knuckles said
that if we broke out</i>

1382
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:46,741
<i>he'd help clear my name,</i>

1383
01:17:47,773 --> 01:17:50,638
<i>and then I could come home.</i>

1384
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,974
But he's gone now
and I'm on my own.

1385
01:17:55,607 --> 01:17:56,771
I don't really know why

1386
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:58,404
I'm calling.

1387
01:17:58,406 --> 01:18:01,005
I suppose
I just wanted to say...

1388
01:18:03,407 --> 01:18:04,675
...goodbye.

1389
01:18:31,906 --> 01:18:34,138
- Hello?
- <i>Paddington?</i>

1390
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:36,372
Yes. Yes, it's Paddington.

1391
01:18:36,374 --> 01:18:38,304
<i>I'm so sorry I escaped,
Mrs. Brown,</i>

1392
01:18:38,306 --> 01:18:39,537
<i>but I thought
you'd forgotten on me.</i>

1393
01:18:39,539 --> 01:18:42,037
We'd never
forget you, Paddington.

1394
01:18:42,039 --> 01:18:44,105
- Paddington?
- You're family.

1395
01:18:44,107 --> 01:18:45,271
And we know who the thief was.

1396
01:18:45,273 --> 01:18:46,438
It's Phoenix Buchanan.

1397
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,905
Mr. Buchanan?

1398
01:18:47,907 --> 01:18:49,539
<i>But he's
disappeared into thin air.</i>

1399
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:51,072
We've been looking for him
at every landmark

1400
01:18:51,074 --> 01:18:53,772
- in that book.
- Every last page.

1401
01:18:53,774 --> 01:18:55,907
"Where all your dreams
come true."

1402
01:18:56,972 --> 01:18:58,472
Why do you say that?

1403
01:18:58,474 --> 01:19:00,838
Oh, it was written on the
last page of the pop-up book.

1404
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,739
<i>Always made me think
of Aunt Lucy.</i>

1405
01:19:02,741 --> 01:19:05,205
- Very bizarre.
- <i>Is it?</i>

1406
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:06,705
I found that exact same phrase

1407
01:19:06,707 --> 01:19:09,305
on a scrap of paper
in Phoenix's house.

1408
01:19:09,307 --> 01:19:10,470
<i>Really?</i>

1409
01:19:10,472 --> 01:19:12,571
I'm sure
I've seen that before.

1410
01:19:12,573 --> 01:19:15,338
Look. "Where all your dreams
come true."

1411
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:16,938
The organ?

1412
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:18,671
That must be where Madame
Kozlova hid her fortune.

1413
01:19:18,673 --> 01:19:19,937
Let's get to the fair.

1414
01:19:19,939 --> 01:19:21,605
It's too late.
They're leaving today.

1415
01:19:21,607 --> 01:19:23,171
From Paddington Station.

1416
01:19:23,173 --> 01:19:24,605
At 6:35.

1417
01:19:24,607 --> 01:19:25,805
There's still time.

1418
01:19:25,807 --> 01:19:27,337
Paddington, head for
the station.

1419
01:19:27,339 --> 01:19:29,472
<i>If we can find Phoenix
and get hold of that book,</i>

1420
01:19:29,474 --> 01:19:31,070
<i>his fingerprints
will prove everything.</i>

1421
01:19:31,072 --> 01:19:33,271
But that's miles away,
Mr. Brown. I'll...

1422
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,038
I'll see you there.

1423
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,072
Clear the road.

1424
01:19:41,074 --> 01:19:42,738
This is a refuse emergency.

1425
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:44,836
Sorry!

1426
01:19:44,838 --> 01:19:48,737
<i>Fellow citizens, I've just
received intelligence.</i>

1427
01:19:48,739 --> 01:19:52,837
<i>The bear has escaped
and may be heading this way.</i>

1428
01:19:52,839 --> 01:19:55,271
<i>I have raised
the neighborhood panic level</i>

1429
01:19:55,273 --> 01:19:56,770
<i>to "wild hysteria."</i>

1430
01:19:56,772 --> 01:19:58,537
Get out of the way,
Mr. Curry!

1431
01:19:58,539 --> 01:20:00,705
Paddington's not coming
this way!

1432
01:20:00,707 --> 01:20:01,904
He's gonna clear his name.

1433
01:20:01,906 --> 01:20:04,338
And we're gonna
bring him home!

1434
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,705
<i>We don't want him here.</i>

1435
01:20:05,707 --> 01:20:08,572
No, of course you don't.
You never have.

1436
01:20:08,574 --> 01:20:10,638
As soon as you set eyes
on that bear,

1437
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,606
you made up your mind
about him.

1438
01:20:12,608 --> 01:20:14,837
Well, Paddington's
not like that.

1439
01:20:14,839 --> 01:20:16,639
He looks for the good
in all of us,

1440
01:20:16,641 --> 01:20:18,937
and somehow he finds it.

1441
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:21,803
It's why he makes friends
wherever he goes.

1442
01:20:21,805 --> 01:20:24,337
And it's why Windsor Gardens
is a happier place

1443
01:20:24,339 --> 01:20:25,937
whenever he's around.

1444
01:20:25,939 --> 01:20:29,204
He wouldn't hesitate
if any of us needed help.

1445
01:20:29,206 --> 01:20:33,540
So stand aside, Mr. Curry,
because we're coming through!

1446
01:20:42,739 --> 01:20:44,237
<i>Nice try, Brown.</i>

1447
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:46,471
<i>Your plan
seems to have stalled.</i>

1448
01:20:46,473 --> 01:20:48,104
<i>Like your vehicle.</i>

1449
01:20:48,106 --> 01:20:51,305
<i>Try the choke. Go on, try the choke.
You're flooding it.</i>

1450
01:20:51,307 --> 01:20:53,071
Clutch down, second gear,
Mr. Brown.

1451
01:20:53,073 --> 01:20:54,638
What?

1452
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,404
- After three. Three.
- <i>What's going on?</i>

1453
01:20:56,406 --> 01:20:59,770
<i>You are illegally perambulating
on a public highway.</i>

1454
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:01,171
Put your backs into it.

1455
01:21:01,173 --> 01:21:03,039
<i>Do not push that vehicle.</i>

1456
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:05,774
- Bring Paddington home.
- Thank you.

1457
01:21:18,307 --> 01:21:22,839
Right, Paddington, stay low,
and remember, you're a bin.

1458
01:21:26,772 --> 01:21:28,737
You're a bin.
You're a bin.

1459
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:31,337
Just an ordinary bin
going for a walk.

1460
01:21:36,473 --> 01:21:39,637
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1461
01:21:39,639 --> 01:21:42,637
Nothing to see here, Officer.
Just a bin.

1462
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,571
Hmm.

1463
01:21:44,573 --> 01:21:46,440
Quite good being a bin.

1464
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:03,007
Gentlemen.

1465
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:25,737
Paddington!

1466
01:22:25,739 --> 01:22:28,906
Mr. Brown!
Quickly, he's on board.

1467
01:22:31,306 --> 01:22:33,637
Don't worry,
I'll handle it myself.

1468
01:22:33,639 --> 01:22:35,605
We've gotta catch up
with that train.

1469
01:22:35,607 --> 01:22:37,874
But how?

1470
01:22:40,439 --> 01:22:42,073
I've got an idea.

1471
01:22:43,473 --> 01:22:45,570
Good morning, madam. Sir.
Welcome on board.

1472
01:22:45,572 --> 01:22:46,871
Morning. Thank you.

1473
01:22:46,873 --> 01:22:48,404
May I offer you a glass
of champagne?

1474
01:22:48,406 --> 01:22:50,204
Oh, thank you so much.
That's very kind.

1475
01:22:50,206 --> 01:22:51,671
Very civilized, yes.

1476
01:22:51,673 --> 01:22:54,004
Nice to have a break
after all I've been through

1477
01:22:54,006 --> 01:22:56,238
with that beastly bear.

1478
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,937
Boiler pressure, 225.

1479
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:00,904
Water, half a glass.
Air brake, off.

1480
01:23:00,906 --> 01:23:03,071
Nice work, J-Dog.

1481
01:23:03,073 --> 01:23:04,671
My name's not J-Dog.

1482
01:23:04,673 --> 01:23:08,604
It's Jonathan Brown.
And I like steam trains.

1483
01:23:08,606 --> 01:23:10,970
- Oh, for goodness' sake.
- I'm so sorry.

1484
01:23:10,972 --> 01:23:13,471
Get off. Stop it.

1485
01:23:13,473 --> 01:23:14,970
Don't shush me, Gertrude.

1486
01:23:14,972 --> 01:23:17,570
I have just been spilled upon
by a chilled liquid.

1487
01:23:17,572 --> 01:23:21,407
Gerald, I want you to shush.

1488
01:23:23,273 --> 01:23:24,838
Yes, Gertrude.

1489
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,271
<i>...seven o'clock.</i>

1490
01:23:26,273 --> 01:23:28,439
<i>Here's the news from the BBC.</i>

1491
01:23:28,441 --> 01:23:30,736
<i>Four convicts
made a daring escape</i>

1492
01:23:30,738 --> 01:23:32,603
<i>from Portobello Prison
last night.</i>

1493
01:23:32,605 --> 01:23:34,438
<i>The prisoners all appear to
have vanished</i>

1494
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,137
<i>without a trace...</i>

1495
01:23:36,139 --> 01:23:37,737
<i>...except Paddington Brown,</i>

1496
01:23:37,739 --> 01:23:40,570
<i>who was seen boarding a fair
train bound for Bristol.</i>

1497
01:23:40,572 --> 01:23:42,104
<i>Police are closing in</i>

1498
01:23:42,106 --> 01:23:44,503
<i>and expect to make
an arrest soon.</i>

1499
01:23:45,906 --> 01:23:48,538
Poor little fella.

1500
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:51,405
Must be somewhere down there
right now.

1501
01:23:51,407 --> 01:23:53,872
Shouldn't we help him,
Knuckles?

1502
01:23:53,874 --> 01:23:55,838
How?
We go back down there,

1503
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,338
they won't just lock us up,
they'll throw away the key.

1504
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:00,939
I know but he's our friend.

1505
01:24:02,241 --> 01:24:03,906
Stick to the plan.

1506
01:24:05,474 --> 01:24:08,673
I don't do nothin' for no one
for nothin'.

1507
01:24:31,306 --> 01:24:33,503
Well, Grandfather,

1508
01:24:33,505 --> 01:24:35,573
the moment of truth.

1509
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:40,540
D.

1510
01:24:42,173 --> 01:24:43,305
D.

1511
01:24:45,373 --> 01:24:46,572
A.

1512
01:24:47,006 --> 01:24:48,007
A.

1513
01:24:48,706 --> 01:24:50,771
The book.

1514
01:24:54,207 --> 01:24:55,640
Ah.

1515
01:24:58,907 --> 01:25:02,270
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

1516
01:25:02,272 --> 01:25:04,837
- Paddington!
- He can't hear us.

1517
01:25:04,839 --> 01:25:06,470
Can this thing go any faster?

1518
01:25:06,472 --> 01:25:08,170
I can try
but I need more coal.

1519
01:25:08,172 --> 01:25:09,271
I'm on it.

1520
01:25:09,273 --> 01:25:11,205
Pull alongside.
I'm going across.

1521
01:25:11,207 --> 01:25:12,971
- I'll come with you.
- Judy...

1522
01:25:12,973 --> 01:25:14,674
Just you try and stop us!

1523
01:25:16,207 --> 01:25:17,506
Come on then!

1524
01:25:52,471 --> 01:25:54,703
- Ready?
- Yep.

1525
01:25:54,705 --> 01:25:55,707
Go!

1526
01:26:07,472 --> 01:26:09,171
<i>Open your mind</i>

1527
01:26:09,173 --> 01:26:10,806
<i>and your legs will follow.</i>

1528
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,771
Mr. Brown!

1529
01:26:19,773 --> 01:26:20,874
Mrs. Bird.

1530
01:26:23,274 --> 01:26:24,473
C.

1531
01:26:28,039 --> 01:26:30,872
And finally E.

1532
01:26:34,505 --> 01:26:36,041
It works.

1533
01:26:49,939 --> 01:26:51,839
Ooh.

1534
01:26:55,407 --> 01:26:57,337
Hello.

1535
01:26:57,339 --> 01:26:59,540
Aren't you pretty.

1536
01:27:00,406 --> 01:27:04,272
West End here I come.

1537
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:08,074
Morning.

1538
01:27:10,705 --> 01:27:11,838
No!

1539
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,839
What was it? D. F.

1540
01:27:15,273 --> 01:27:16,573
D.

1541
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:19,070
Come back with that book.

1542
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:43,771
Where do you think
you're going, bear?

1543
01:27:43,773 --> 01:27:48,771
It's a train. It comes to
an end, like all of us alas.

1544
01:27:50,973 --> 01:27:51,974
Whoops.

1545
01:27:54,473 --> 01:27:58,307
Exit bear,
pursued by an actor.

1546
01:28:00,573 --> 01:28:02,439
Phoenix Buchanan.

1547
01:28:03,438 --> 01:28:05,139
Mrs. Bird?

1548
01:28:05,141 --> 01:28:07,637
Oh, so now you remember me?

1549
01:28:07,639 --> 01:28:11,170
Well, I never. The cavalry.

1550
01:28:11,172 --> 01:28:16,003
An old crone, a little girl
and an insurance man.

1551
01:28:16,005 --> 01:28:17,204
What am I going to do?

1552
01:28:17,206 --> 01:28:19,337
I'll tell you exactly
what I'm going to do.

1553
01:28:19,339 --> 01:28:21,403
- Mmm?
- I'm going to bloomin' well

1554
01:28:21,405 --> 01:28:23,004
biff you on the nose.

1555
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:25,071
Not a very good idea.

1556
01:28:26,338 --> 01:28:29,604
Stage combat, level four.

1557
01:28:29,606 --> 01:28:32,571
Well, where I come from,
laddie,

1558
01:28:32,573 --> 01:28:35,470
they teach you never to bring
a knife to a gunfight.

1559
01:28:36,806 --> 01:28:39,739
I think you'll find
that fires plastic darts.

1560
01:28:41,405 --> 01:28:43,671
So it does.

1561
01:28:43,673 --> 01:28:46,674
Whereas this sword looks
very sharp.

1562
01:28:48,174 --> 01:28:49,940
Back you go.
All of you, back.

1563
01:28:59,974 --> 01:29:02,504
And for you, sir,
the jumbo pavlova.

1564
01:29:02,506 --> 01:29:03,840
- Ah.
- Enjoy.

1565
01:29:06,173 --> 01:29:10,507
Oh, hello, Your Honor.
The hair is looking lovely.

1566
01:29:15,107 --> 01:29:16,772
Paddington!

1567
01:29:16,774 --> 01:29:17,974
Mrs. Brown!

1568
01:29:20,373 --> 01:29:22,838
I've got an idea.

1569
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:27,041
Good. Good. Excellent.
Now for your furry friend.

1570
01:29:37,606 --> 01:29:39,840
Slow down, Jonathan.

1571
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:48,104
Coo-ee!

1572
01:29:48,106 --> 01:29:50,440
What a clever little bear.

1573
01:29:55,405 --> 01:29:58,436
Don't worry.
I know a wee trick

1574
01:29:58,438 --> 01:30:01,006
Harry Houdini used to do.

1575
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:18,774
Jump, Paddington!
I'll catch you.

1576
01:30:20,372 --> 01:30:21,572
No!

1577
01:30:22,905 --> 01:30:24,572
Whoa!

1578
01:30:34,807 --> 01:30:36,539
Bye-bye, bear.

1579
01:30:53,906 --> 01:30:54,974
Bullseye!

1580
01:31:15,973 --> 01:31:18,137
Stop the train, Jonathan!

1581
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:55,606
Let's go, lads.

1582
01:33:29,539 --> 01:33:31,437
Knuckles, you came back.

1583
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:33,537
Can't make marmalade
on my own now, can I?

1584
01:33:33,539 --> 01:33:35,170
Thank you, everyone.

1585
01:33:35,172 --> 01:33:36,439
Paddington?

1586
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:38,704
He's burning up.

1587
01:33:38,706 --> 01:33:40,606
Better get
the little fella to bed.

1588
01:33:42,339 --> 01:33:43,638
- Mom!
- Paddington!

1589
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:45,004
He's not well.

1590
01:33:45,006 --> 01:33:47,037
Don't worry,
he's gonna be fine.

1591
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:48,774
Aren't you, little buddy?

1592
01:34:12,572 --> 01:34:13,936
Paddington!

1593
01:34:13,938 --> 01:34:16,971
- Where am I?
- Take it easy now.

1594
01:34:16,973 --> 01:34:21,404
You gave us a wee scare,
but you're home now.

1595
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,738
- Home?
- That's right. Look.

1596
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:25,936
The police realized they'd
made a terrible mistake.

1597
01:34:25,938 --> 01:34:28,804
Phoenix Buchanan
has been arrested, and,

1598
01:34:28,806 --> 01:34:32,537
I might add, is no longer
a member of our Platinum Club.

1599
01:34:32,539 --> 01:34:35,903
- Then...
- You're a free bear.

1600
01:34:35,905 --> 01:34:39,137
- How long have I been asleep?
- Three days.

1601
01:34:39,139 --> 01:34:41,537
Three days! But that means...

1602
01:34:41,539 --> 01:34:43,236
It's Aunt Lucy's birthday.

1603
01:34:43,238 --> 01:34:45,404
And I never sent her anything.

1604
01:34:45,406 --> 01:34:46,804
It's all right, Paddington.

1605
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:48,936
But it isn't all right,
Mrs. Brown.

1606
01:34:48,938 --> 01:34:53,471
You see, Aunt Lucy did so
much for me when I was a cub.

1607
01:34:53,473 --> 01:34:56,370
Without her I'd never
have come to London.

1608
01:34:56,372 --> 01:34:59,069
And I suppose
all I ever really wanted

1609
01:34:59,071 --> 01:35:01,137
was to make her proud.

1610
01:35:01,139 --> 01:35:03,369
But now she's going to wake up
on her birthday

1611
01:35:03,371 --> 01:35:04,737
with no present

1612
01:35:04,739 --> 01:35:07,070
and think
I've let her down completely.

1613
01:35:07,072 --> 01:35:11,903
Oh, you great goose,
she won't think that at all.

1614
01:35:11,905 --> 01:35:13,040
Won't she?

1615
01:35:13,971 --> 01:35:15,639
Come with us.

1616
01:35:17,772 --> 01:35:20,806
Here he is!

1617
01:35:27,273 --> 01:35:30,671
- What are you all doing here?
- We wanted to say thank you.

1618
01:35:30,673 --> 01:35:31,902
Thank you?

1619
01:35:31,904 --> 01:35:33,003
For everything
you've done for us.

1620
01:35:34,173 --> 01:35:36,204
If it wasn't for you,
we'd never have met.

1621
01:35:36,206 --> 01:35:38,069
You helped me pass my exam.

1622
01:35:38,071 --> 01:35:40,304
I would be permanently locked
out of my house.

1623
01:35:41,706 --> 01:35:44,969
I'd say you've rather a lot
to be proud of.

1624
01:35:44,971 --> 01:35:47,337
And when we heard
that the police wanted

1625
01:35:47,339 --> 01:35:48,769
the popping book
for evidence,

1626
01:35:48,771 --> 01:35:52,438
we thought we'd find
Aunt Lucy another present.

1627
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,003
So we all
clubbed together.

1628
01:35:54,005 --> 01:35:56,970
I pulled in a few favors
from my old Air Force chums.

1629
01:35:56,972 --> 01:35:59,538
And we think
she's going to love it.

1630
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:02,203
But... what is it?

1631
01:36:02,205 --> 01:36:03,571
You wanted to get that book

1632
01:36:03,573 --> 01:36:06,004
so Aunt Lucy could see London,
didn't you?

1633
01:36:06,006 --> 01:36:07,704
It was always her dream.

1634
01:36:07,706 --> 01:36:11,969
Well, we thought,
why look at London in a book

1635
01:36:11,971 --> 01:36:14,371
when she could see
the real thing?

1636
01:36:17,406 --> 01:36:19,540
Why don't you go
and answer that?

1637
01:36:36,706 --> 01:36:38,073
Oh...

1638
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:42,707
Paddington.

1639
01:36:45,039 --> 01:36:47,440
Happy birthday, Aunt Lucy.

Phoenix Buchanan,

1664
01:38:07,506 --> 01:38:11,670
you have proved yourself
to be a heinous criminal

1665
01:38:11,672 --> 01:38:15,604
and a disgrace to the noble
profession of acting.

1666
01:38:15,606 --> 01:38:19,104
I sentence you to ten years,

1667
01:38:19,106 --> 01:38:24,739

your time behind bars wisely.

1668

after all. Just
