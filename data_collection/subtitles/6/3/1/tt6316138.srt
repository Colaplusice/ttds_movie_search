A bicycle!

6
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,000
I've made you a gift, honey.

7
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,208
Doesn't it look great?

8
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,083
Off we go!

00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,541
She's a natural.

00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:52,833
Make way!
My little girl's coming!

11
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,333
What's going on?

12
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,833
Nothing.

13
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,500
Nothing. Don't be afraid. I'm here.

14
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,333
-Hide!
-Where are you going?

15
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,041
Seol, quiet.
Don't make a sound.

If you keep crying,
you won't see Mommy and Daddy again.

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,625
Seol. No crying.

Suleyman!

25
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:30,958
I'll be right there. What's with the racket

Come on, man!

27

Thank God!
At frigging last!

Is your morning crap never done?
It's the same every damn morning!

29
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,541
A good deed on a summer's day.
You should try it.

30
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,791
Do you do it on purpose every morning?

31
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,541
The grooming, the outfit...
It never ends!

32
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,416
Your spit and polish is our
bread and butter as NCOs.

00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,250
-Fix that tie.
-Keep tightening it. Good job.

Let's go! Let's go!

-You know what I dream of?
-What?

37
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,541
Folks in other countries
bike around the world.

38
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,708
What's stopping us?

39
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,916
Why are we stuck here man?

40
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,708
Yeah right! It's far enough biking to base
every day and you want a world tour?

41
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,458
Where have you been?
The girls are waiting.

42
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,583
Pedal up!

43
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,250
Can't you go a day
without seeing them? Huh?

44
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,791
I'm sweating buckets here.

45
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,708
-Shut up and you won't sweat. Pedal up! Up!
-Exactly!

-I'm not too late, am I?
-No, you aren't.

48
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,166
Don't worry, I put yours aside.

49
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,708
-It didn't rip coming down, did it?
-Of course not.

Oh my God.

51
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,041
Look at her!
Talk about gorgeous.

52
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,500
Your girls are great okay,
but she's really something else.

53
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,208
-Just look at her.
-Would she even look at you?

54
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,000
-Why not?
-Look at you.

55
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,208
What's wrong with me?

56
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,875
Put that tie properly for once
for heaven's sake.

57
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,458
You're a disgrace to the NCOs.

58
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,583
Enough with the tie guys.
I've had it.

59
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:07,166
If anyone mocks my soldiership.
I'll slap them with my marksmanship papers.

60
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,541
Don't get me going.
I'm not a mechanic like you guys.

61
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm a marksman, OK?

62
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,875
I'm a crack shot.
I hit every time.

63
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,458
-Have a good one.
-Thanks.

64
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,875

Shh! Heaven forbid!

76
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,916
They're college educated.
They won't be deployed.

77
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,000

85

It's an order. Sit down.

86
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,708
Why did I send for you, Suleyman?

87
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,541
As you may have heard,
we're sending troops to South Korea.

88
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,625
Yes, sir.

89
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,208
-May God make us proud.
-Amen.

90
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,708
Ankara has organized a battalion.

91
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,375
But we have orders to send reinforcements.

92
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,791
I had you in mind, Suleyman.

93
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,208
Your absence will be an issue for me.

94
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,750
But good, proficient soldiers like yourself
are needed over there.

95
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,875
What do you say?

96
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,333
-I'd be honored, sir.
-Bless you.

97
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,750
-You have anyone waiting for you?
-I do, sir.

98
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,083
Someone dearer to me than life.
Like my country.

99
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,083
-Don't those Koreans all look the same?
-Sure they do.

100
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,125
Only to you, though.

101
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:29,083
Suleyman.
OK, you're going as technical staff.

102
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,250
But this is war.

103
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,583
I can't imagine you in a warfare.

104
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,416
Don't let his look fool you.

105
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,791
-He's from Maras. It's in his blood.
-May God test no one with war.

106
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,291
If your life isn't in danger, why would
anyone kill anybody just for the kicks?

107
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,875
So we shouldn't drop
a few Commies over there?

108
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,208
Is that what you mean?
Those Commies are persecuting people there.

109
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,666
-So let's drop one or two.
-Quiet, hold on. Is he going with you?

110
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:58,750
My buddy's off to war.
Am I supposed to wait for him here?

111
00:08:58,791 --> 00:08:59,958
Who'll look out for him there?

112
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,708
He doesn't have anyone.
Have you talked to your family?

113
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,291
Please send a message to Nuran
through Iclal.

114
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,166
I really have to talk to her tonight.

115
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,625
It's Ali leading you astray, isn't it?

116
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,375
He always wants more.
He just wants adventure.

117
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,500
But why are you going to Korea?

118
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,250
Don't say that.

119
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,625
The people there need our country
and my country need me.

120
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,000
I can't walk away from that.

121
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,500
-Celal is, though.
-But I can't.

122
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,000
That's what makes me who I am.
Don't you love me the way I am?

123
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,041
Yes, I do.

124
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:44,333
But it's so far. So very far.

125
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,416
What if you go there and forget me?

126
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,250
You can't mean that!

127
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,500
Is that what you're worried about?

128
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,958
I'm an orphan. My uncle sees me
as a burden. All I have is you.

129
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,583
You're my refuge, you're my anchor.
What if you too left this orphan girl?

130
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,500
I wouldn't. I wouldn't.

131
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,166
I won't. I'll write to you every day.

132
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:11,875
I'll take photos. You'll read, you'll see.
It'll be like I'm by your side. I promise.

133
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,750
You know I see you passing by each morning?

134
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,791
I save it in my mind.

135
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,416
You feel me too.

136
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,166
Don't you ever forget.

00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,041

00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,750
<i>Don't tell the girls
but we've all been issued arms.</i>

172
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,833
<i>We've begun target practices.</i>

173
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,916
<i>As you kept saying,
we're going to war.</i>

174
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:18,541
<i>The Americans show us films about weapons
and military formation and train us."</i>

175
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,666
<i>Pushing north of the 38th parallel
</i>into North Korea...

176
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,791
<i>"Lt. Mesut translates the films for us.</i>

177
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,958
<i>He's going to be the interpreter.</i>

178
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,125
<i>Our introduction was quite interesting."</i>

179
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,875
-Sir.
-Suleyman.

180
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,791
At ease. You're in the motorized unit.
Where can I get diesel?

181
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,250
I'll siphon some from a jeep in the hold.

182
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,375
Great!

183
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,750
There are so many ants in my cabin,
they devoured me the whole night.

184
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,541
I told the Americans
and the assholes just laughed.

185
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,458
It happens, sir.

186
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:52,416
The blessed things climb
the hawsers in port.

187
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,375
Whatever. Bring some diesel
and I'll get the cabin cleaned out.

188
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,250
But then they'll die.

189
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,625
What are we supposed to do
besides killing them?

190
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,291
You feed them.

191
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,333
They're after their food, sir.

192
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,916
They'll flock to the sugar
and leave you alone.

193
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,166
You need to learn to live with them.

194
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,500
-Are you a Communist like me?
-No.

195
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,791
I'm not up on those things.

196
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,916
But there's a lot to learn from the ants.

197
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,625
Guys who wouldn't hurt an
ant are going to war.

198
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,833
<i>Ali's a crack shot. Time and again
he shoots his bullets with other bullets.</i>

199
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:47,083
<i>Being determined to kill
the Communist North Koreans...</i>

200
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,125
<i>He doesn't get along with Lt. Mesut.</i>

201
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,625
<i>My love...</i>

202
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,041
<i>This one-month journey
will soon be over.</i>

203
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,375
<i>As I keep saying...</i>

204
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,541
<i>...don't think any bad thoughts.</i>

205
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,166
-What's up, sir?
-They asked if we have any clerics with us.

206
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:17,041
So they've even learned about our
devotionals.

207
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:21,750
No, it's not about prayers or ablutions.
They've got their priests, right?

208
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,875
And they're not here to preach
on Sundays.

209
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,000
So why are they here?

210
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,291
It won't always be
you taking them out, Ali.

211
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,666
Suppose they kill us?

212
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,958
Every dead will be buried
according to their religion.

213
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:43,416
<i>Busan - South Korea
October 1950</i>

214
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,500
Welcome.

215
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,833
Welcome.

216
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,625
Welcome.

217
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:15,041
OK. Let's go, guys.
It's another 95 km north to Daegu city.

218
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,083
<i>Daegu - South Korea
</i>-My friends, this summer,...

219
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,166
...North Korea brutally invaded
the entire country.

220
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:36,625
But the Peacekeeping Force has driven back
the enemy to its borders...

221
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,125
...and freed South Korea
from the invasion.

222
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:43,375
<i>Now it's time for the final blow
on the border.</i>

223
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,708
<i>Our destination is Kunu-ri.</i>

224
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:51,125
<i>For the first time, our Turkish armed forces
will be engaged in close combat.</i>

225
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,791
Goddamn savages!
See what they've done to the country.

226
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,791
<i>With what you saw on the way here,
now you know how sacred this mission is.</i>

227
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,375
<i>U.S. 25th Division - Kunu-ri
-My fellow friends,...</i>

228
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,875
<i>...this is the line
where that last blow will be delivered.</i>

229
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,041
<i>It has massive strategic importance.</i>

230
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,958
Why are they scattered all over the place?

231
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,166
Suppose there's an emergency?

232
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,500
The Americans say the job is done...

233
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,083
...and that we'll be home in a month
for Christmas.

234
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,708
Come by the fire.
Let's eat some marshmallows and drink.

235
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,083
Marshmallows?
We came all this way to eat candy?

236
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,125
They cooked up a task to
keep us hanging around here.

237
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,791
Shoot a few guerrillas
and you'll feel better.

238
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,125
Dammit! We get here and
it's all over.

239
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,375
If it suits you.

240
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,708
The Americans ask and we do it.

241
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,583
What do you mean?
They've brought us here to exploit?

242
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,333
Don't they trust us?
Is that why they put us behind the lines?

243
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:11,000
Do you want to be useful to
your country like a true patriot...

244
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,833
...or do you just want to hunt Communists?

245
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,291
What kind of question is that?

246
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,541
Whose side are you on, sir?

247
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,000
Why? Are you going to report me
as a spy?

248
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,541
-Are you threatening me?
-No, but whose side are you on?

249
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,750
-Tell us and we'll act accordingly.
-Sir.

250
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,250
I was sent here because
I'm good at what I do.

251
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,750
Like all of us.

252
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:37,000
If we agree on it,
let's get back to work please.

253
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,833
We need to organize
this vehicle traffic stat.

254
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,541
Or we'll be immobilized
in an emergency.

255
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,333
What emergency, Suleyman?

256
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,833
They say the hunting party is over.

257
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,875
This is over.

258
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,916
This way!

259
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,083
Let's find the commander.

260
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,333
Find the commander!

261
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,875
Find the commander!

262
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,791
We had orders to contact the 9th Corps
in case of emergency.

263
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,458
Communications are down.
Give me the permission and I'll go.

264
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,541
-But I need a good driver.
-At your command, sir!

265
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,041
-I want an interpreter, too.
-Yes, sir!

266
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,833
You get new orders and find us.
Any questions?

267
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,250
The war was over before our boys
even got to Korea.

268
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,500
Which means they'll be back early.

269
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,750
I pray he asks my uncle for my hand
as soon as he's back.

270
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,333
Celal and I are looking at rings, too.

271
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,000
So it'll be a double engagement in spring!

272
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,791
Iclal?

273
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,166
Shall we go to the wedding dress maker?

274
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,541
There's a gorgeous one on display.

275
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,375
OUR ARMY MAY COME BACK
WITH AN EARLY VICTORY

276
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,041
Let's pick up some speed.

277
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,541
It's all we can do without headlights
in the moonlight, sir.

278
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,958
I know. We have no choice.
Turn on the headlights.

279
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,000
Ali, on the right!
Evacuate the vehicle!

280
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,541
Nimet?

281
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,250
What is it, dear?
Nothing's wrong, I hope?

282
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,083
I have a bad feeling, Mom.

283
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,541
Ali!

284
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,291
Sir, were these your men?

285
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,625
I don't think they like you a lot.

286
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,291
Is everyone OK?

287
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,875
If we take the road,
we'll be sitting ducks.

288
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,500
We'll head through the forest instead.

289
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,125
Come on.

290
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:13,333
Damn you Pepe.
Didn't we bring you as a guard?

291
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,458
-Yes, sir.
-Then why don't you fire?

292
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:20,541
But, sir. I'm not used
to this infidel rifle.

293
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,208
And stop calling me Pepe all the time.
It gets to me.

294
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,125
Didn't you tell us that
your nickname was Pepe?

295
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,458
-Quiet!
-At least stop saying it now.

296
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Stop!

297
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,083
God help us keep our sanity.

298
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,375
Motherfuckers.

299
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:52,791
They've butchered women, children,
everyone.

300
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,416
Keep your eyes peeled.
The guys who did it could still be around.

301
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,958
They're here.
I swear they are.

302
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:08,833
Ali, wait!

303
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,125
I think it's animals.

304
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,458
Sir...

305
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:17,958
...if we fire a round,
we'll find out.

306
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Sure, and give away our position.

307
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:23,166
-Sir, let me take a look.
-Be careful.

308
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,250
Come here.

309
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:40,625
Come on, don't be scared.
I won't hurt you.

310
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,500
Come on.

311
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:07,208
Come here. Come.

312
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,000
Oh my.

313
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:17,458
You scared the shit out of us.

314
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
She's terrified.
She can't speak.

315
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:22,083
Our mission is important, Suleyman.
The girl will hold us back.

316
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:24,458
Sir, we can't leave her here.

317
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,500
Come on. Let's go.

318
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,833
She's cold, poor thing.

319
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:31,958
Suleyman, look at me.

320
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:33,541
It suits you.

321
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:34,958
Give me a break.

322
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,708
<i>9th Corp Command
Un Hung-ni</i>

323
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,625
-Don't go anywhere.
-Sir.

324
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:47,916
Can you ask about the girl?
What should we do?

325
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:51,375
Ask the general about the kid
when so much else is going on?

326
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:57,291
Sir, is the girl South Korean or...

327
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,500
...from North Korea?

328
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,916
I wouldn't know. Whatever.

329
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,416
She's clearly homeless.

330
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:10,708
Well for example, back home,
if you go south...

331
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:15,708
...I mean down towards Mugla.
You get these prominent cheekbones.

332
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,791
Hell, Muharrem!
You don't just stammer, you never shut up!

333
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,708
But since you like talking so much...

334
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,083
...go get some milk or something
to feed the girl.

335
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,041
She'll starve to death.

336
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,250
-She's cold, you know.
-Frozen.

337
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:33,416
-Maybe she needs to pee.
-I expect she'd find a way to say if she does.

338
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,000
She hasn't said a word yet, huh?

339
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:37,416
No, just whimpered all the way here.

340
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,416
We don't know her name either.
What do you think it is?

341
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:43,000
Let's name her.

342
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,708
-You think so?
-Sure.

343
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:47,375
What shall we name her?

344
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,875
Let's name her after my mom.

345
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:51,833
Her name shall be Naciye.

346
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,000
-Yeah right.
-Why not?

347
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:57,666
-She's a little kid. Naciye wouldn't fit.
-So what shall we name her?

348
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:59,250
Let's name her after your mom.

349
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:01,541
-What's your mom's name?
-Gulcin.

350
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,958
Nope. That sounds like a hostile name. No.

351
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,416
Then what shall we name her?
Let's find something.

352
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,041
How about Ayla?

353
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:17,833
-Ayla?
-She has a face like the moon, look.

354
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:20,916
And we found her in the moonlight.

355
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:22,666
Shall we name you Ayla?

356
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:27,000
-Bravo, sir.
-Great. OK.

357
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,583
-It's decided.
-Ayla.

358
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:31,416
You're such a cutie.

359
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:35,333
Gentelmen...

360
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:37,416
...this is a work of Chinese army

361
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,166
They are in the game too.

362
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:41,958
This war we thought was ending,
it's now just beginning

363
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,750
North Koreans do not stand alone now.

364
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:47,625
We're helping the southerners,
Chinese helping the north.

365
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,625
It's multinational on both sides now.

366
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:52,041
Now we provide you extra vehicles
and personnel.

367
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:55,083
My radio operator Captain Cage
he'll be company with you.

368
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,458
Capt. Cage is coming with us.

369
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,333
You'll be giving me the latest intelligence
in real time.

370
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,875
-They'll pass on information.
-We work together as a team.

371
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:03,541
Lieutenant Lee knows this area
like the back of his hand.

372
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:06,125
He will guide you along
the new secret route we've given.

373
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:08,833
He will guide you along
the new secret route we've given.

374
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:12,833
Turkish forces are spread across
a wide area behind the enemy.

375
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,583
We'll contact these forces
with our new operation plan.

376
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:17,875
Let's go get them colonel.

377
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:23,500
Sir, I got a bottle of milk.

378
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:26,208
-Good man.
-There's milk powder, too.

379
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,583
Those Americans powdered everything.

380
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,833
Bring that blanket.
She's frozen.

381
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,000
I got her.

382
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:34,750
You got her?

383
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:37,583
My little bird!

384
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,791
-Here you go.
-Easy.

385
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:41,958
Let's go.

386
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:43,416
I'll explain on the way.

387
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,833
They find her middle of a massacre
on the way.

388
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:52,083
They couldn't leave her there
and they took her with them.

389
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:55,125
-That's pretty remarkable.
-Yes it is.

390
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,291
<i>This was taken from Marshal Douglas MacArthur's
Korean War memories</i>

391
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:58,625
Turks are interesting people.

392
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:01,625
We put a call up to the whole world,
they were the first responders.

393
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,500
You know, this war goes down in history...

394
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,375
...it won't be me,
it won't be you, pal.

395
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:09,666
Will be them the most mentioned
in the books.

396
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,250
You stay with the girl.
I'll take a look.

397
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:31,666
Aren't you hungry yet?

398
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,250
Look what I've got.

399
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:37,541
You want some milk?

400
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,000
Don't make a face.

401
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:43,958
I'll have some first, OK?

402
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:48,416
Damn it. I spilled it.

403
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:50,208
Definitely a spill.

404
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,125
Want some?

405
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:58,833
I just got disgrace call of the radio.
We need to get to Kunu-ri.

406
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:02,083
The captain says we need to get to Kunu-ri
right away, sir.

407
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,375
There is a narrow road up there
on the right side...

408
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:06,083
...we can use to get to Kunu-ri faster.

409
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:09,708
He says there's a road to the right
which will get us to Kunu-ri faster, sir.

410
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,166
Good idea. OK.

411
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:17,791
Ali, tell Sgt. Suleyman to take a look at
the captain's jeep.

412
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:23,125
The major wants you to fix the vehicle.
Take a look.

413
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,958
Wait two minutes and
I'll be back.

414
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,833
Wait. You can't come.

415
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:30,416
-Suleyman! Come on!
-Stop that. I'll get burned.

416
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:33,750
-I have to fix the jeep.
-Go ahead then sergeant.

417
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:36,208
Are you going to look after the girl
or the jeep?

418
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:39,916
Give her to someone else.
We're in a hurry.

419
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:41,208
Soldier!

420
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,166
-Yes, sir!
-You stay here.

421
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,333
Watch the girl. We mustn't let her
to be a burden on them.

422
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:47,500
Yes, sir!

423
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:51,083
He's going to watch her.
So she doesn't bother you too much.

424
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:54,208
He'll watch the girl.
He says let's not bother them anymore.

425
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,458
She's a little kid.
She won't be a burden.

426
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,250
If the lieutenant says so, OK.

427
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:10,875
I haven't let anyone take you away
so sit here and be good, OK?

428
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,708
Ali, get to the ignition.
Let's see what the problem is.

429
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:26,541
Goddammit!

430
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,750
Did they check nothing before leaving?

431
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,041
If they were my men,
I'd ax all leave for 3 months.

432
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,625
Of course! No problem.
Oh, boy!

433
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:34,791
Just ignite it.

434
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:37,250
There, that's the Suleyman we miss.

435
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:38,458
Just fire it.

436
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:41,125
Here goes.

437
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,750
Okay.

438
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,583
Not quite but anyways.

439
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,833
-Let's go catch the others up.
-Come on.

440
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:57,083
That girl hasn't taken her eyes off
you for the last half hour.

441
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:58,958
Hey, girl!

442
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,125
Come here. Come on.

443
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:03,333
Come here.
What a cutie.

444
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:10,958
Get the girl!

445
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,125
Ayla! Ayla!

446
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,041
-Suleyman!
-The girl's OK! She's OK!

447
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:38,500
Get under there, go on. Go on, under!
Stay right there.

448
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:44,000
We're up in the shit creek here. Fuck!

449
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,750
-Suleyman!
-Why does the damn thing take only six?

450
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
Suleyman, you have to do something!

451
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:52,458
Suleyman!

452
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:57,291
I'm trapped in here.
I can't look up, Suleyman!

453
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:58,958
You have to do something!

454
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,166
Ali, watch my six!

455
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,250
Ali, toss it over.

456
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,791
Send it.

457
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,250
Suleyman! Watch out.
They're flowing like a pack of dogs.

458
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:26,500
We're screwed if they get down here.

459
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:31,291
It's OK.

460
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,708
Don't be scared.

461
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,416
Don't be scared.
I'll get you out of here.

462
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,250
Ali, they're coming.

463
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:57,958
They're coming, Ali!

464
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:12,666
Suleyman, whatever you're doing,
do it fast!

465
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:14,041
I can't keep up.

466
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:21,625
Suleyman!

467
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:49,875
Suleyman!

468
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:39,458
Read all about it! War starts again
when they said it was over!

469
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:43,291
Read all about it!
The world writes of Turkish heroism as our...

470
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:48,083
<i>We have wounded in the mechanics' company.
Our estimated casualty rate is 20%.</i>

471
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:51,375
We must be prepared for any news.

472
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:56,750
A casualty rate of 20%. Means one in
every five who boarded the ship.

473
00:36:57,541 --> 00:37:00,166
Don't be like that.
Where there's God, there's hope.

474
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:04,208
<i>Cries of "Allah Allah" are still rising
high above the Korean hills.</i>

475
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,166
<i>Kunu-ri is under enemy occupation.</i>

476
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,125
<i>A small Turkish convoy leaving Kunu-ri
at the last minute...</i>

477
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:11,458
<i>...came under heavy machine-gun fire.</i>

478
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,416
<i>We have wounded
in the mechanics' company.</i>

479
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:15,458
With the Chinese now backing the enemy...

480
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:19,708
...a clash broke out at Kunu-ri,
this place on the border.

481
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,958
That's where Suleyman is.

482
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,458
I don't know what to say, Nuran.

483
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,166
We'll have to wait for the news.

484
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,500
I told him.

485
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,250
I told him not to go. I told him.

486
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:38,083
I knew it.

487
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:39,458
Nuran.

488
00:37:57,791 --> 00:37:58,875
Ayla.

489
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,083
Suleyman.

490
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:05,416
Hey, you're back from death's clutches.

491
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,083
Where's my Maras Monster?

492
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:10,750
You're the man! Seriously.

493
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:15,708
The guy comes as an engine mechanic,
then he fucks up the whole damn place.

494
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:17,375
What the hell kind of guy are you man?

495
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:21,291
-You guys are OK, aren't you?
-You're still-- Yes, we're fine.

496
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:24,250
Are you OK? Is there a problem here?
Any pain?

497
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:26,666
-No, thank God.
-Where are your legs?

498
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:28,708
Stop it. Don't make me laugh.

499
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,416
I was so scared
something would happen to you.

500
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:38,041
But you, you're such a sweetheart.
Come here. Come on.

501
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:40,833
She's OK, too, thank God.
No cuts and bruises?

502
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:42,875
She hasn't left your bedside.

503
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:45,458
She's like a kitten.

504
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:50,375
Give them a drop of milk
and they never leave you.

505
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:54,125
But the Koreans rightly
wanted to take her.

506
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,416
When Ayla wouldn't go, Lee intervened.
He said he'd talk to base.

507
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,500
The number of orphaned children is
increasing

508
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:20,583
The number of children
looked after by the Turks isn't going down.

509
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:24,250
They're all our children.

510
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:30,333
They've travelled thousands of miles
to help us.

511
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:33,625
And they're fighting,
shedding blood for us.

512
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:37,250
Should they be looking after our children
as well? That isn't right.

513
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:40,125
The Chinese are now helping
the North Koreans.

514
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:45,416
It's hard to make time for that now
when we have to fight and pull back south.

515
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:50,208
The Turks have offered to open a school.

516
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:55,041
Lt. Lee is closest to the Turks.

517
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:56,333
What do you say?

518
00:39:56,375 --> 00:40:00,125
It's safest if we keep the children
at the HQ...

519
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:03,833
...until a secure place is
built for them.

520
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,625
But the decision is yours, sir.

521
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:17,291
One, two... Three, four...

522
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,333
At ease, Suleyman.

523
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:24,291
The war's heating up, sergeant.

524
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:28,833
We'll be retreating, advancing,
we'll be maneuvering constantly.

525
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:32,125
As such, we can't have the girl with us.

526
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:34,500
I understand, sir.

527
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:36,125
Everything happened so suddenly.

528
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:39,750
-If we could find her parents...
-That's for the Korean authorities to do.

529
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:42,791
We've notified them.
We'll hear back in the next few days.

530
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:44,583
That soon?

531
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:49,833
Sir, she didn't leave my side
when I was sleeping. How can I--

532
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:52,875
That's what I'm talking about son.
Don't get any more attached.

533
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,041
It'll end up being hard
for her and for you.

534
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:58,208
Get back to work.

535
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,166
I've assigned Sgt. Sadik
to your command.

536
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:03,041
He's very capable.
He got a lot done in your absence.

537
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,625
Now, forget baby sitting
and go back to your duties.

538
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:08,083
-Off you go.
-Yes, sir.

539
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:10,166
Suleyman.

540
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:13,083
We're proud of the bravery you showed.

541
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,083
Fighting was heavy at Kunu-ri.
We sustained serious losses.

542
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:17,625
But we kept the Chinese out.

543
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:21,666
Thanks to us, all allied forces
were able to retreat unharmed.

544
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:24,416
And so the South Korean
authorities are...

545
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:28,083
...hosting a medal ceremony
to honor our gallant men.

546
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:31,166
Get yourself ready.
We'll be taking a trip.

547
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:35,375
But leave the girl with Sadik.
I don't want to see her there.

548
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,125
That'll be all.

549
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:42,916
Don't worry, sergeant.

550
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,541
Even if she doesn't have parents,
we're all her brothers and uncles here.

551
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:48,375
We'll give Ayla everything she needs.

552
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,208
I made her clothes myself actually.

553
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,208
You did?

554
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:55,958
They didn't come from villagers?
Where did you get the material?

555
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,250
It's the blanket you've put on her, sir.
I'm a bit of a tailor, too.

556
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:02,875
I saw the girl had no clothes.
I sized her up and out came a coat.

557
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:04,333
It'll keep her warm as toast.

558
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:06,666
-You mean you create from nothing.
-So they say.

559
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:09,666
I'm a bit crazy so
I've never won more stripes.

560
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:13,708
But may the Lord not be offended,
I'll create anything you need from nothing.

561
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:15,125
Thanks.

562
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:16,833
Ayla.

563
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:23,208
Look, I'm going to leave now
and you'll stay here with Sadik. OK?

564
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,666
I guess she understands.

565
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,000
OK then.

566
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:34,833
Oh God.
You can't come with me.

567
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:37,458
OK? You stay here. Here.

568
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:41,958
Oh, dear God.

569
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,916
It's forbidden.
I can't take you.

570
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:47,041
Shoo! What the hell is "shoo"?

571
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:48,916
Forbidden.

572
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:51,250
-Take her away.
-Forbidden? What the hell?

573
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:53,791
You're reverting back to yourself.
What are you trying to tell the girl now?

574
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:56,708
What can I do?
It's too bad but we can't take her.

575
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,750
I had a word with your doctor.

576
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:01,583
-He said she's older than five.
-Really?

577
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:02,625
Yeah.

578
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:04,833
She's in shock.
That's why she can't talk.

579
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:07,166
God knows, maybe she saw
her parents got killed.

580
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:09,208
It's a sick world.

581
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,750
Wow! Well, well.

582
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:35,666
Terrific!
We've come to a fairground!

583
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:37,250
Pass the camera and
let's take a photo.

584
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:39,375
-Good point.
-Let them be proud.

585
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:42,041
Just there is good, right?

586
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:43,291
You know where to push, right?

587
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:45,500
Just get on with your primping.

588
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,541
Fireball!

589
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:49,875
Come on.

590
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:54,041
Stand proud.

591
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,750
We saw in Kunu-ri...

592
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:59,500
...that we now share blood ties
not only with the Americans,...

593
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:02,750
...but also with the Turks.

594
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:06,750
The Turks have a famous saying.

595
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:08,916
I'd give my life...

596
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,250
...so my country would live on!

597
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:15,708
Long as this country lives on,...

598
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,083
...we will never forget the sacrifice...

599
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:24,750
...you have made in fighting with us...

600
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:27,541
...as brothers in arms.

601
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:33,708
Soldier...

602
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,416
...thanks for your service, pal.

603
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,583
Soldier...

604
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:41,708
We also confirm
with general Byeong Soon.

605
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:45,500
As you see we other all one big happy family
we have no doubt.

606
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,875
And she'll be healthy and happy...

607
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:51,708
...with you.
Until her family is found.

608
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:55,166
-He says we're one big family.
-I got that.

609
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:57,916
You don't have to interpret feelings.
Come here honey.

610
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:19,833
"As you can see, I'm very well.

611
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,125
Medals and accolades aside,...

612
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:25,750
...this little girl has
marched into our lives...

613
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:29,333
...and lit up the dark world of war."

614
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:32,458
He's fine.

615
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,375
Why the long face?

616
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:35,958
Smile a bit.

617
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,583
I don't know, Iclal.

618
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:43,333
I'm terrified something will
happen to him.

619
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:45,958
He puts his life at stake for that girl.

620
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:48,333
Suppose he'd died?

621
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:59,041
<i>January, 1951</i>

622
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:14,958
At ease, son.

623
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:17,000
Suleyman, these are from back home.

624
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:19,750
I asked my wife to send them.
Thankfully she has.

625
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:24,083
-How's our Ayla? Good?
-Thank you sir. She is fine.

Throw it!

635
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:18,708
-Catch it dear!
-He threw it!

636
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:23,125
Come on, open your mouth wide.

637
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:24,750
Open! Open wide!

638
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:27,791
Good girl, Ayla!

00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:29,958
You know my name?

640
00:47:31,791 --> 00:47:33,333
My name's Suleyman.

641
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:35,208
What's your name?

642
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:40,041
Why won't you talk, sweetie?

643
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:43,875
We'll run out of milk at this rate.

644
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:42,375
Good night.

00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:49,500
You can't sleep with us.

646
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:51,750
You should sleep here.

647
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:55,625
That's your place.
You sleep there, OK?

648
00:48:58,291 --> 00:48:59,500

681
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:53,791
She thinks her name is Ayla.
I don't get it either.

682
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:57,250
Since she's learning,
she mustn't just pick things up.

683
00:51:57,833 --> 00:51:59,375
She must learn proper Turkish.

684
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:02,000
I asked some friends
and they sent some books.

685
00:52:02,083 --> 00:52:04,083
Ayla. Look.

686
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:40,875
Give me a Marilyn film.
What's this crap?

687
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:11,250
No mummy.

688
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:15,916
No brother.

689
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:20,625
Daddy!

690
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,916
My sweet.

691
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,291
Daddy.

692
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:59,166
<i>April, 1951</i>

693
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:01,416
-One, two!
-One, two!

694
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:02,625
-Three, four!
-Three, four!

695
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:05,500
Ayse, go to sleep.

696
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:08,375
You've earned your
shopping leave this weekend.

697
00:54:09,916 --> 00:54:11,958
There's talk of going to Tokyo, but...

698
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,291
I've discussed that.
But it's a surprise.

699
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:15,875
First, we finish the book.
Come on, Ayla.

700
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:18,333
Swim, Ayse, swim.

701
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:21,416
Ayse, here's a bicycle.

702
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,875
A bicycle, yes!

703
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:25,083
My girl knows the bicycle too.
Well done.

704
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:27,583
-Bicycle.
-Yes, bicycle.

705
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:29,833
-Come.
-Where? Stop.

706
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,458
OK, I'm coming.
Where are we going?

707
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:36,708
OK, OK, I'm coming. Wait.

708
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,083
Bicycle.

709
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:47,958
Bicycle, yes. Whose is it?
How did you know it's here?

710
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,708
It's Sadik's.

711
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:54,250
Bravo. Now come here.
You play for a bit, OK?

712
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,125
I have a few things to do.

713
00:54:57,708 --> 00:54:59,500
What's this, Sadik?

714
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:03,875
It's my addiction. I can't relax
unless I tinker with things like this.

715
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:06,458
-Where did you find all those parts?
-From the villagers.

716
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,500
Contact with the locals is forbidden.

717
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:10,958
What do you trade?
Our gears?

718
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:14,458
God forbid! I pay with cash
and my ration cans.

719
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:18,333
The parts are all broken anyway.
Worthless unless I fix them.

720
00:55:18,708 --> 00:55:20,791
What will you do
when the bike's done?

721
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:23,125
You think they'd let you ride it here?

722
00:55:23,291 --> 00:55:24,791
I'll sell it, sergeant.

723
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:27,416
We'll get Ayla some new clothes.

724
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,291
You bring Ayla into it as hush money
to Sgt. Suleyman...

725
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:33,958
...and carry on with your tricks here?
Is that it?

726
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:35,416
Nice ruse.

727
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,458
Shame on you, Sadik.

728
00:55:37,791 --> 00:55:39,291
Not those gloves as well?

729
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:44,166
No, sergeant. I fixed a stove
and got those gloves from villagers.

730
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:47,625
But sewed the other things myself.
Just to keep her warm.

731
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:50,000
I have a sibling away from home, too.

732
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:54,041
You've got me all wrong, 1st lieutenant.

733
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:55,916
I'm not a dishonest man.

734
00:55:57,208 --> 00:55:59,833
Dismantle the bike and
put an end to it.

735
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:03,916
I won't report you for now,
but if I catch you again, we'll fall out.

736
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:07,500
Eat up now.

737
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:11,208
We're fine here,
but men are dying on the fronts.

738
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:13,166
We'll share the same fate.

739
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:15,208
You think we'd get out of here alive?

740
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,000
There's nothing to fear but fear itself.

741
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,375
No man can live forever.
Not even the Prophet Suleyman.

742
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:21,833
Imagine, Suleyman the great.

743
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,000
When he, of all people, died...

744
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,666
Imagine that.

745
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:33,375
You're very quick to judge people, sir.

746
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:36,250
I am also confused, Suleyman.

747
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:38,333
So we shouldn't hurt any feelings.

748
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:41,208
My dear? Ayla?

749
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:43,750
Why are you crying?
What's wrong?

750
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:48,083
They said you'd died.
Are you dead?

751
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:49,958
Come on! Who said that?

752
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:54,250
They said even the Suleyman is dead.

753
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:57,541
-What did they say?
-"Even the Suleyman is dead..."

754
00:56:57,625 --> 00:56:59,250
Oh, come on now.

755
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:02,000
That Suleyman isn't me.
He's somebody else.

756
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:04,041
It's just a fairy tale Ayla.

757
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:07,333
-I'm not that Suleyman.
-That's Suleyman The Sultan.

758
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:10,166
So you won't die, will you?

759
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:13,208
-No. I won't die.
-Was she crying for that?

760
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:17,541
I think we should take Ayla
to Tokyo for Children's Holiday.

761
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:20,125
-To cheer us all up.
-Great!

762
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:23,875
1st Lt. Mesut will pick on me nonstop,
whatever the excuse.

763
00:57:24,291 --> 00:57:25,625
No, I won't.
Not on a holiday.

764
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:35,416
<i>Tokyo - Japan
April 23, 1951</i>

765
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:07,750
I watched you all day.

766
01:00:12,666 --> 01:00:15,500
You took in this wounded bird,
you healed her.

767
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,541
Then you let her fly.

768
01:00:21,166 --> 01:00:23,166
We'll soon be going back to Turkey.

769
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:25,166
How will you let her go?

770
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,625
Or how will she let us go?

771
01:00:50,666 --> 01:00:52,875
-Sadik.
-Welcome back, sir.

772
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:58,083
Sergeant...

773
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:01,916
...I haven't told anyone but
we may have found Ayla's family.

774
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,166
Some villagers have seen Ayla.

775
01:01:11,416 --> 01:01:13,708
-The ones you trade with?
-Yes.

776
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,375
A man came when you were gone to
say Ayla has a family.

777
01:01:16,416 --> 01:01:17,791
They want the girl.

778
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:20,833
They say to bring her
or we'll be in trouble.

779
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:29,958
I'll talk to them whoever they are.
Alone.

780
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,250
You can't go alone. Let me come too.
I know a little Korean.

781
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:35,500
No man. You watch Ayla.

782
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:38,208
And especially don't let Ali hear.

783
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:46,125
Ayla. My dear, please read me
what it says here.

784
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:49,833
But first make me a promise.

785
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:51,458
You will behave tonight, OK?

786
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,916
Listen to Ali's radio.

787
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:56,875
I have a quick errand
but I'll be back. OK?

788
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,625
-OK.
-Way to go my clever girl.

789
01:01:59,666 --> 01:02:01,083
Now read it.

790
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:33,750
Hello.

791
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,666
Sir!

792
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:53,250
I'm going to tell you something
but you didn't hear it from me.

793
01:02:56,458 --> 01:02:58,208
Su-Su-Sul...

794
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:01,166
-Send for Suleyman and Ali.
-Yes, sir!

795
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:04,708
How could you let the man go?
Are you crazy?

796
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:08,791
God knows where he's gone.
Why did no one tell me till now?

797
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:11,750
-What if something hap...
-I told him not to go 50 times.

798
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:14,458
He wouldn't listen.
I said "don't go" but he did.

799
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,291
-What do we do now?
-Let's go.

800
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:18,833
Where is the man? Do we know?
How will we find him?

801
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:20,416
I know.

802
01:03:24,041 --> 01:03:26,333
-Can you sign a vehicle out?
-No.

803
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:29,166
Actually, there's a vehicle but...

804
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:36,833
If Sgt. Suleyman sees, he'll kill me.

805
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:42,791
-Does that rusty bucket work?
-I take that as an insult.

806
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:52,291
I was going to bike around the world
and now look at me!

807
01:03:54,666 --> 01:03:56,083
Don't move, you son of a bitch!

808
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:57,333
Get the hell off me!

809
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:01,375
Where are the Americans?
Tell me now!

810
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:03,666
Son of a bitch!

811
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:07,750
-I don't understand what you're saying.
-How many men are there in your unit?

812
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:09,875
-And forget Chinese!
-Tell me!

813
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:11,333
Get off me!

814
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:12,541
Tell me!

815
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:20,916
Don't move!

816
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:24,875
Don't move!

817
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:26,375
Don't move!

818
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:29,458
Let our man go.

819
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:32,291
We have more men outside!

820
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:33,791
Let our man go!

821
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:36,083
Let our man go!

822
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:42,333
You're all dead.

823
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:43,791
Suleyman, move.

824
01:04:43,833 --> 01:04:45,666
Move Suleyman.
Sadik, get the bike!

825
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:48,208
Sadik, get the bike!

826
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,666
He fixed that damn bike, didn't he?

827
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:52,583
Go bro.

828
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:58,875
What did you say in there?

829
01:04:58,916 --> 01:05:02,875
That the army outside would shit on them
if they didn't let you go.

830
01:05:02,916 --> 01:05:04,166
Where did you learn it all?

831
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:06,333
The language from Ayla,
the lies from America.

832
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:08,500
Run! Sadik!

833
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:11,541
Sadik, where are you?
They'll cap our asses Sadik!

834
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:15,958
Step on it!

835
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,833
That's my baby!

836
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,125
Why do you go around doing this stuff
on your own?

837
01:05:24,166 --> 01:05:25,375
I don't know.

838
01:05:25,416 --> 01:05:28,833
I thought they were Ayla's family.
Suppose they really had been?

839
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:30,500
Step on it!

840
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:32,416
Step on it! Step!

841
01:05:32,625 --> 01:05:34,625
Nice bike eh, sir?

842
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:36,083
Is it that bike?
Holy...

843
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:37,750
Hold the bike idiot!

844
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,750
We'll talk about it later.

845
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:41,916
Where are these men,
1st lieutenant?

846
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:44,416
What a bike!

847
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:48,458
Sgt. Suleyman is not too well, sir.

848
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:52,875
Pardon the details,
but he's got diarrhea.

849
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:55,750
He leaks everywhere.

850
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:59,708
So where's Ali?
Has he also got di...

851
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:10,250
Isn't he out yet?
Is he in the latrine?

852
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:13,125
We'll see.

853
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:18,083
Sir, forgive me.

854
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:22,375
That Marilyn of yours is coming.

855
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:24,000
Who?

856
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:26,875
She's singing a few songs for morale.

857
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:29,291
The colonel heard you were fans.

858
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:33,458
But unfortunately
a mission's come up for Ali...

859
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,708
...and since you have the stomach flu.

860
01:06:35,916 --> 01:06:38,333
It's not meant to be.
Can't be helped.

861
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:44,541
-Which Marilyn is he talking about?
-Your Marilyn.

862
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:47,583
-What did you do?
-Screwed.

863
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:51,583
Let go! Get off!
I'll die if I don't see the girl today.

864
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:54,958
-I'd rather go AWOL than missing this!
-Grab him!

865
01:06:55,166 --> 01:06:57,875
Suleyman,
I've been waiting all my life for this day.

866
01:06:57,916 --> 01:07:00,625
Calm down.
The girl's here for two days.

867
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:02,750
Keep out of this, Suleyman.

868
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:05,291
-OK, I'm keeping out of it.
-If anyone stops me,...

869
01:07:05,333 --> 01:07:07,541
...I'll shit on them today and tomorrow.

870
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:08,666
-Do it.
-Look.

871
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:11,625
Maybe I go today, I might wangle a date.
Tomorrow I'll say how I feel,...

872
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:14,125
...the day after that we'll be an item.
Why are you stopping me?

873
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:15,916
-Who's stopping you?
-Why are you stopping me?

874
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:17,458
Just listen my man.

875
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,125
Remember the lecture you gave me yesterday
about doing things?

876
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:22,583
-You want to go to jail yourself?
-Suleyman is right.

877
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:26,875
Look, we'll take Ayla today.
And I promise you...

878
01:07:27,291 --> 01:07:31,666
We'll get her to sign one of these
with her own pen in her own writing.

879
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:34,875
And then a lipstick kiss on top. Huh?

880
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:37,791
What's that? Are these new?

881
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:38,875
Yes.

882
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:44,083
-She really printed and sent them herself?
-Yes.

883
01:07:48,125 --> 01:07:51,791
-Would she sign one for me?
-Sure! Addressed to you in person.

884
01:07:51,958 --> 01:07:55,833
"To dearest Ali, with love."
Tomorrow we'll go again together.

885
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:58,833
You can say you're Ali.
I'll be your translator.

886
01:07:58,875 --> 01:08:00,875
-Huh? How about it?
-Tomorrow?

887
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:02,208
Tomorrow.

888
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,166
-You promise?
-I told you.

889
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:09,916
-You promise, Suleyman?
-Yes.

890
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:12,458
-You promise?
-Of course.

891
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,375
Right, dear?

892
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,750
Getting an autograph will be tough.

893
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,708
-We promised. What do we do?
-I don't know.

894
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,625
If I don't get that autograph,
Ali would never speak to me again.

895
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:57,541
There's no going back.
I'm barging my way through sir.

896
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:22,833
Excuse me, excuse me.

897
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:24,583
I have a child with me.
Thanks.

898
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,125
Wave, Ayla. Wave.

899
01:09:42,375 --> 01:09:45,125
She's looking.
Wave, Ayla. Wave.

900
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:50,375
Wave.

901
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:53,750
Come over little cutie.

902
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:56,666
Don't forget your big brother Ali!
Don't forget him.

903
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:58,500
Don't forget Ali.

904
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:03,416
Hi.

905
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:05,208
What is this.

906
01:10:06,541 --> 01:10:08,375
Do you want me to sign this.

907
01:10:08,416 --> 01:10:09,916
Yes?

908
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:12,458
For who is it?

909
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,083
Tell her dear.

910
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:17,791
-Ali.
-Good girl!

911
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:18,875
For Ali.

912
01:10:18,916 --> 01:10:19,916
Okey.

913
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:22,875
For Ali.

914
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:36,666
This is for Ali.

915
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,541
Do you want me to kiss it.

916
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:43,875
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

917
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:46,333
Kiss it! Kiss it!

918
01:10:58,458 --> 01:10:59,875
Wait for me.

919
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:04,666
Start the music again.

920
01:11:21,416 --> 01:11:23,291
Suleyman...

921
01:11:27,791 --> 01:11:29,208
Sir!

922
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:33,375
Sir!

923
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:40,916
Sir! Sir!

924
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:44,166
Sir! Help me! Sir!

925
01:11:44,666 --> 01:11:46,375
Sir! Sir!

926
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:47,708
Sir!

927
01:11:47,916 --> 01:11:50,125
Medic! Medic!

928
01:12:15,958 --> 01:12:17,375
Don't cry.

929
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,208
I'll never leave you.

930
01:12:48,958 --> 01:12:53,625
<i>July, 1951</i>

931
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,500
Fellow soldiers...

932
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:15,583
...we've spent one year in Korea.

933
01:13:16,416 --> 01:13:19,041
We've lost many of our fellow men.

934
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,125
God rest their souls.

935
01:13:22,166 --> 01:13:25,583
But now it's time to go home.

936
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:30,041
Newly arriving troops...

937
01:13:30,458 --> 01:13:33,458
...will take over from us gradually.

938
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:36,166
I thank you all very much.

939
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:38,666
-Forgive me if I failed you in any way.
-Thank you!

940
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,166
Ayla, come on. Eat it girl.

941
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,833
You don't play with your food Ayla.

942
01:13:45,041 --> 01:13:47,041
A second unit of troops is coming, sir.

943
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:49,708
Yes, they'll take over from us.
We're going back.

944
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:52,333
First privates, then NCOs
and then us.

945
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:56,625
I'm happy for you.

946
01:13:57,083 --> 01:13:58,708
I'm staying on as a volunteer.

947
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:00,958
I may return after another tour, sir.

948
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:06,333
Isn't it a little early to decide, Suleyman?

949
01:14:10,791 --> 01:14:12,166
<i>My love...</i>

950
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:15,833
<i>We've moved again,
this time to an old school.</i>

951
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:18,083
<i>The address is on the envelope.</i>

952
01:14:18,583 --> 01:14:20,583
<i>News must have reached home by now.</i>

953
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:26,750
<i>Every day I listen to songs and the news
from home on the radio Ali left behind...</i>

954
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:28,333
<i>...and I think of you.</i>

955
01:14:32,083 --> 01:14:34,500
<i>Please be patient for a little longer.</i>

956
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:41,625
-Give me your blessing, sir.
-Come here.

957
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:48,958
-This is for you.
-Thanks.

958
01:14:51,208 --> 01:14:52,333
Thanks.

959
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:53,625
Ayla.

960
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:57,666
F... F... Fa... Far...

961
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:01,750
Farewell...

962
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:03,791
My little lamb.

963
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:07,375
My little lamb.

964
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:27,666
<i>My love...</i>

965
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:31,083
<i>We're sending the privates
under our command home now.</i>

966
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:33,375
<i>New men are coming to replace them.</i>

967
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:35,375
<i>We're training them, too.</i>

968
01:15:35,666 --> 01:15:38,458
<i>So you see,
I'm staying here a while longer.</i>

969
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:42,750
-Anything for me?
-No, sir.

970
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:46,750
<i>Why don't we know about it?</i>

971
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,833
He left without telling us.
OK, we were proud.

972
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:54,208
But it's time he came back.
He's done his duty.

973
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:56,666
It's time we got him married.

974
01:15:57,333 --> 01:16:00,458
They said he had a sweetheart
in Iskenderun.

975
01:16:00,541 --> 01:16:03,166
<i>On air now, we bring you Heroes Hour.</i>

976
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:06,791
<i>First up, a request
from Nuran Sayilgan of Iskenderun.</i>

977
01:16:06,833 --> 01:16:12,250
<i>The song is written and composed
in the Maqam Suzinak by Sedat Oztoprak...</i>

978
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:15,458
<i>...and is dedicated to
Sgt, Major Suleyman Dilbirligi,...</i>

979
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:18,000
<i>...an NCO serving in South Korea.</i>

980
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:22,041
<i>So here we have "If you only knew
how much I miss you".</i>

981
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:28,375
<i>Oh, if you only knew...</i>

982
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:36,250
<i>...how much I miss you</i>

983
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:42,875
<i>Oh, if you only knew...</i>

984
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:48,541
<i>...how much I miss you</i>

985
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:55,291
<i>Where are you?</i>

986
01:16:55,750 --> 01:17:07,875
<i>You've stopped coming, my love</i>

987
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:12,625
<i>Where are you?</i>

988
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:21,875
<i>You've stopped coming, my love</i>

989
01:17:25,416 --> 01:17:29,250
Honey. Now I understand
your chest pains.

990
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:32,583
But I don't want your hopes
to be dashed.

991
01:17:32,625 --> 01:17:36,041
He's seen foreign lands.
He won't like this places now.

992
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:37,875
For two people to be togeth--

993
01:17:37,916 --> 01:17:39,541
It's all right, Mom.

994
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:42,791
He's a good person.

995
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:46,541
He was like that as a child.

996
01:17:48,666 --> 01:17:50,500
He deserves to be happy.

997
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:53,791
Just so long as he's well.

998
01:17:55,458 --> 01:17:57,666
What does the song say, Daddy?

999
01:17:58,333 --> 01:18:00,666
-It says "Go back."
-Where to?

1000
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:04,083
Home.

1001
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,291
I have a home, too.

1002
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:08,416
Are you going to go?

1003
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:12,958
Not without you.

1004
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:21,375
<i>You're the one I love</i>

1005
01:18:21,458 --> 01:18:23,458
What do you mean you aren't going?

1006
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:26,541
It's not your decision.
There are orders.

1007
01:18:26,708 --> 01:18:31,333
So long as you work for the Armed Forces
you have to obey those orders.

1008
01:18:31,375 --> 01:18:33,041
If not, you resign.

1009
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,916
How can I, sir?

1010
01:18:34,958 --> 01:18:37,708
I have responsibilities at home,
people I made promises to.

1011
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:41,333
That's my point son.
Isn't it tough on those people?

1012
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:42,666
Isn't it tough on Ayla?

1013
01:18:43,541 --> 01:18:45,166
She calls me "Daddy".

1014
01:18:45,458 --> 01:18:47,291
She can't go on without me now.

1015
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:49,500
If they let me have her,
then I'll go back.

1016
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:50,750
Enough!

1017
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:52,208
This conversation is over!

1018
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:54,250
Ayla is Korean and she's staying here.

1019
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,500
-Anything for me?
-No, sir.

1020
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,666
Sgt. Suleyman.

1021
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:08,458
The colonel's sent for you.

1022
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:09,791
Let's go.

1023
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:12,541
Let's go then.

1024
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,291
At ease, son.

1025
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:32,000
We have a landing ship leaving
on Friday.

1026
01:19:32,041 --> 01:19:35,541
It'll call at Izmir,
we have to send you with it.

1027
01:19:37,291 --> 01:19:38,833
We're going in 10 days ourselves.

1028
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:41,500
We're handing the command
over to new Turkish officers.

1029
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:43,291
You can’t stay here so pack up.

1030
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:46,333
You don't understand.
What will happen to Ayla?

1031
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:49,583
Our army has established
the promised orphanage in Suwon.

1032
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:52,458
Ankara School.
Ayla will live there.

1033
01:19:53,041 --> 01:19:54,875
She'll go to school like her peers.

1034
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:57,291
This lady here runs the school.

1035
01:20:01,416 --> 01:20:04,625
She brought some clothes for Ayla.
She wants you to give her.

1036
01:20:05,166 --> 01:20:09,166
All the children like Ayla
who've been cared for by our troops are...

1037
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:11,250
...being taken in by Miss Ji-Min.

1038
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:13,958
They're grateful to you.
But don't push it.

1039
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,166
Besides, it'll be good for Ayla, too.

1040
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:19,041
But Ayla won't leave me
just like that.

1041
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:22,083
And I'd like to see
where she'll be living.

1042
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:25,208
I'll go with him, colonel.
Don't you worry.

1043
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:29,083
We did a good deed. It shouldn't
end this way. Let it end amicably.

1044
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:07,000
You know why we're here Ayla?

1045
01:21:07,791 --> 01:21:10,625
You'll have wonderful friends here.
You'll get to meet them.

1046
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,291
Do you want to look around
with your teacher?

1047
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:18,250
But you can't go to school with me too.

1048
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:22,208
See your friends all together there?
They're altogether, not scared.

1049
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:24,291
You want them to think you're scared?

1050
01:21:24,583 --> 01:21:27,791
That you can't even come to school
without your Daddy?

1051
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:33,500
-OK.
-OK. Good girl.

1052
01:21:37,583 --> 01:21:39,583
Come on. Say bye to daddy.

1053
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:40,916
Go on.

1054
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:50,500
I'm coming too, OK.
Here I am.

1055
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:02,666
Ayla, say hi to your friends.

1056
01:22:05,416 --> 01:22:06,666
It's a good place.

1057
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:09,041
It'll be even better.

1058
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:11,875
Turkish Army will keep its support here.

1059
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:15,541
My name is Ayla.

1060
01:22:15,625 --> 01:22:18,458
Way to go.

1061
01:22:19,583 --> 01:22:21,541
Say bon appetit.

1062
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:22,958
Bon appetit.

1063
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,458
Here you can study English
with your friends.

1064
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:43,541
This is a terrific anthem, Ayla.

1065
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:46,541
Anthem. Like a song.

1066
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:51,000
-Like the ones on the radio?
-Like the ones on the radio, yes.

1067
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:53,666
<i>Ankara, Ankara, glorious Ankara</i>

1068
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:57,833
Look, if you learn to sing this anthem
better than everyone...

1069
01:22:57,916 --> 01:22:59,625
I'll always be proud of you, OK?

1070
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:04,500
<i>Anyone in trouble hopes for your help</i>

1071
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:09,000
<i>You provide for them, glorious Ankara</i>

1072
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:13,583
<i>Ankara, Ankara, glorious Ankara</i>

1073
01:23:13,625 --> 01:23:18,208
<i>Anyone ill-starred wants to see you</i>

1074
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:22,750
<i>Anyone in trouble hopes for your help</i>

1075
01:23:22,791 --> 01:23:26,958
<i>You provide for them, glorious Ankara</i>

1076
01:23:27,041 --> 01:23:31,166
<i>Ankara, Ankara, glorious Ankara</i>

1077
01:23:31,708 --> 01:23:35,583
<i>Anyone ill-starred wants to see you</i>

1078
01:23:36,166 --> 01:23:40,000
<i>Anyone in trouble hopes for your help</i>

1079
01:23:40,666 --> 01:23:45,000
<i>You provide for them, glorious Ankara</i>

1080
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:08,000
Daddy!

1081
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:15,791
Daddy!

1082
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:25,083
You're going home.
You said you wouldn't go without me.

1083
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:26,750
You said you wouldn't leave me.

1084
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:29,041
I won't leave you. I won't.

1085
01:24:29,583 --> 01:24:31,333
We'll leave this place together.

1086
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:33,083
Come on now.

1087
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:34,833
Come on.

1088
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:52,166
It'll be a bit tough,
but you won't suffocate.

1089
01:24:53,291 --> 01:24:55,708
You mustn't make a sound
on the ship, OK?

1090
01:24:56,708 --> 01:24:57,708
OK.

1091
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,500
<i>Once we're on the ship,
it will be easy.</i>

1092
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:08,000
<i>I'll hide you away.</i>

1093
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:49,375
Don't you miss home, Sergeant?
You're late to return.

1094
01:25:50,083 --> 01:25:51,250
It's my duty, sir.

1095
01:25:56,291 --> 01:25:59,916
That suitcase is so huge.
What have you got in there?

1096
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:06,875
Not a lot, sir.
Most of it's from the Tokyo trip.

1097
01:26:07,958 --> 01:26:10,375
I've talked about this place so much
in letters.

1098
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:13,000
I'll open it if you want to see.

1099
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:20,875
Sergeant...

1100
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:24,708
...have a safe journey.

1101
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,208
Thank you, sir.

1102
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:40,916
Suleyman.

1103
01:26:42,416 --> 01:26:43,541
Suleyman.

1104
01:26:46,541 --> 01:26:48,708
Suleyman, where's the girl?

1105
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:52,833
Open the suitcase.

1106
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:20,291
Do you know how bad this is
when everyone was so grateful to you?

1107
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:23,208
I've begged everyone.

1108
01:27:23,583 --> 01:27:25,416
No one's going to file a complaint.

1109
01:27:28,166 --> 01:27:32,000
All I ask is that you board that ship
and go home.

1110
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:39,666
When I came here,...

1111
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:42,541
...I was told to leave everything behind.

1112
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:44,916
So I did.

1113
01:27:47,291 --> 01:27:49,916
Now they want the same
on my way back.

1114
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:53,708
I've already left Ali.

1115
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:58,208
They can count that.

1116
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:02,625
But I can't leave Ayla.

1117
01:28:02,666 --> 01:28:04,500
Even if I did,
she wouldn't let me go.

1118
01:28:04,625 --> 01:28:08,041
She's just a child.
She can't make decisions.

1119
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:10,500
Nobody's separating you.

1120
01:28:10,541 --> 01:28:14,166
This war will end.
Go home, make a life, come back later.

1121
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:17,416
Ayla will be here, in her country.
Believe me it's better that way.

1122
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:19,500
Please think rationally.

1123
01:28:20,083 --> 01:28:22,291
A young tree flourishes in its own soil.

1124
01:28:23,583 --> 01:28:25,208
For God's sake, Mesut...

1125
01:28:25,291 --> 01:28:28,125
...do you really believe
what you're saying?

1126
01:28:31,916 --> 01:28:33,541
I believe in you.

1127
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:41,625
I know that one day
you'll come back for her.

1128
01:28:59,958 --> 01:29:01,166
No crying.

1129
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,666
Don't cry.

1130
01:29:04,791 --> 01:29:07,208
If I hear you've been crying,
I'll be very sad.

1131
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:11,250
OK, maybe you can cry a bit.

1132
01:29:11,625 --> 01:29:14,833
But you mustn't cry once I've gone, OK?

1133
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:17,541
Promise me.

1134
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:23,333
-You promise?
-Promise.

1135
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:24,666
Good girl.

1136
01:29:25,416 --> 01:29:27,583
Now I'm going to make you a promise.

1137
01:29:29,708 --> 01:29:31,333
I'll come back, OK?

1138
01:29:32,958 --> 01:29:36,166
I'll come back
and we won't ever be separated then.

1139
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:38,375
You promise?

1140
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,708
I promise.

1141
01:29:41,208 --> 01:29:44,208
Fathers strive for their children.

1142
01:29:45,416 --> 01:29:48,250
They live for the promises
they've made to them.

1143
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:50,166
I'll be back.

1144
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:52,500
I promise.

1145
01:30:02,208 --> 01:30:03,958
I'll be back.

1146
01:30:48,125 --> 01:30:54,000
<i>Iskenderun Turkey, 1951</i>

1147
01:30:59,458 --> 01:31:01,000
Welcome home.

1148
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:04,625
Thank you.

1149
01:31:08,375 --> 01:31:10,166
Ilhan was in Izmir to meet me.

1150
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,208
What a treat it is being welcomed!

1151
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:15,791
You've come back alone.

1152
01:31:16,041 --> 01:31:19,041
How could we not meet you
in a day like this?

1153
01:31:22,166 --> 01:31:24,375
Wow! Congratulations.

1154
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,666
It suits you both.

1155
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:30,458
Why didn't Nuran come?

1156
01:31:31,083 --> 01:31:32,708
I haven't heard from her in a while.

1157
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:36,875
Didn't she get permission
or have you arranged a surprise party?

1158
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,625
We're not the only ones
who get engaged Suleyman.

1159
01:31:42,125 --> 01:31:43,958
We didn't want you to hear it from us.

1160
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,750
But you can guess.

1161
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,750
Is it true what I've heard?

1162
01:31:59,958 --> 01:32:01,583
My uncle heard the radio.

1163
01:32:03,041 --> 01:32:07,041
The world is a big place for you but
this is a small place.

1164
01:32:07,375 --> 01:32:09,000
So what if he heard?

1165
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:11,708
Why didn't you tell him everything?

1166
01:32:12,291 --> 01:32:14,291
You should've told him.

1167
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:17,083
Why didn't you say anything, Nuran?

1168
01:32:17,666 --> 01:32:20,375
Am I a thief? Am I evil?
Am I a runaway? Dishonest?

1169
01:32:20,416 --> 01:32:21,833
You aren't a thief.

1170
01:32:23,666 --> 01:32:27,375
Neither evil nor dishonest,
but you are disloyal, Suleyman.

1171
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:31,083
As for running away...

1172
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
...you should've thought about that
when you chose to stay on.

1173
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:38,500
I told you not to leave me.

1174
01:32:39,666 --> 01:32:42,666
But you cared more about that little girl
than this girl here.

1175
01:32:46,333 --> 01:32:48,458
I was given this engagement ring...

1176
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:52,583
...and I hope you're given
many more medals.

1177
01:32:57,666 --> 01:32:58,958
Goodbye.

1178
01:33:41,416 --> 01:33:43,333
-I urgently need to wire some money.
-Sure.

1196
01:35:26,916 --> 01:35:29,458
Ahmet, I'm leaving a bit early today.

1197
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,500
I trust you to take care of things.

1198
01:35:33,041 --> 01:35:34,916
The colonel's car has broken down
on the road, sir.

1199
01:35:34,958 --> 01:35:36,166
It's an emergency.

1200
01:35:53,291 --> 01:35:55,125
-Good morning.
-Morning.

1201
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:58,625
I won't let you go today
without at least some tea.

1202
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:02,291
Yes, but...
I have things to do, Nimet.

1203
01:36:02,333 --> 01:36:05,208
You're looking for that girl in Korea,
aren't you?

1204
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:09,208
I know.

1205
01:36:09,916 --> 01:36:12,458
Come sit down and let's
talk about it.

1206
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,166
There's nothing that can't be worked out.

1207
01:36:16,875 --> 01:36:19,083
I don't know how much you know.

1208
01:36:21,125 --> 01:36:22,750
We were ambushed one night.

1209
01:36:23,125 --> 01:36:25,125
That's where we found Ayla.

1210
01:36:25,291 --> 01:36:27,291
How could I leave her there?

1211
01:36:27,833 --> 01:36:30,666
I couldn't. She was so cute.
You should've seen her.

1212
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:33,166
She had a face like the moon.

1213
01:36:33,916 --> 01:36:35,625
Ali was all for giving her a name.

1214
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:37,166
Wait, I should pour it.

1215
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:39,750
Well, basically...

1216
01:36:41,166 --> 01:36:43,166
...I promised the girl, Nimet.

1217
01:36:44,166 --> 01:36:47,875
Look. I've always been proud of
what you did for the girl.

1218
01:36:49,375 --> 01:36:51,791
I thought, "That's the man I fell for."

1219
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:55,250
We're married now.
Please let me help you.

1220
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:57,666
But how can you help?

1221
01:36:57,708 --> 01:37:01,250
Your girl is my girl,
your promise my promise.

1222
01:37:01,291 --> 01:37:04,125
I'll apply to wherever necessary.

1223
01:37:04,291 --> 01:37:06,500
Don't say I won't know what to do.

1224
01:37:06,583 --> 01:37:08,583
If you show me, I'll learn quickly.

1225
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:12,000
<i>I'm the wife of a Korean War hero.</i>

1226
01:37:12,375 --> 01:37:14,666
I'll command respect wherever I go.

1227
01:37:16,208 --> 01:37:18,041
<i>Just so long as you let me.</i>

1228
01:37:52,166 --> 01:37:54,000
I'll start the inquiry myself.

1229
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:55,750
Sure. Of course.

1230
01:37:58,916 --> 01:38:00,125
Please.

1231
01:38:03,083 --> 01:38:04,166
<i>Mr. Suleyman...</i>

1232
01:38:04,208 --> 01:38:07,000
...as you know,
I'm afraid the war is still on.

1233
01:38:07,041 --> 01:38:09,083
That makes communication very hard.

1234
01:38:09,166 --> 01:38:12,500
It's also impossible for us to
inquire under the name "Ayla".

1235
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,833
But that's her name.
I mean, she doesn't have another name.

1236
01:38:17,333 --> 01:38:20,541
Well, Mr. Suleyman,
we're getting nowhere this way.

1237
01:38:21,583 --> 01:38:24,083
I'd say try your luck again now and
then but...

1238
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:26,958
...it's no good unless you go there
and get involved in person.

1239
01:38:27,791 --> 01:38:29,208
Unfortunately.

1240
01:38:29,333 --> 01:38:34,541
I've written to Ankara School in Korea.
I'm hoping for an answer very soon.

1241
01:38:35,291 --> 01:38:38,708
We've a good chance of hearing back
one way or another.

1242
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:41,083
It'll just take a little time.

1243
01:38:44,541 --> 01:38:46,166
We'll find the girl.

1244
01:38:51,666 --> 01:38:53,875
Has the girl forgotten her name, Nimet?

1245
01:38:56,291 --> 01:38:58,916
If they say your dad is looking for you,
she'd say it right away.

1246
01:39:00,958 --> 01:39:02,375
She hasn't forgotten.

1247
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:05,250
I'm a girl, too.
No girl forgets her father.

1248
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,625
When the war ends,
I must use my first leave to go there.

1249
01:39:12,416 --> 01:39:14,041
I need to be with her.

1250
01:39:14,458 --> 01:39:16,333
It's at least a week's journey.

1251
01:39:16,875 --> 01:39:18,708
Two weeks there and back.

1252
01:39:19,416 --> 01:39:21,625
How will you get so much leave?

1253
01:39:22,375 --> 01:39:24,208
There has to be another way.

1254
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:26,083
I'm looking into it all.

1255
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,125
The math is obvious.

1256
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:33,000
Not even the state can help...
How will I manage on my own?

1257
01:39:35,416 --> 01:39:37,250
You aren't on your own.

1258
01:39:38,541 --> 01:39:40,375
Come on, get some rest.

1259
01:39:43,541 --> 01:39:45,541
It just needs a little time, Suleyman.

1260
01:39:46,125 --> 01:39:47,750
Just a little time.

1261
01:40:06,583 --> 01:40:08,583
Suleyman! Suleyman!

1262
01:40:08,958 --> 01:40:10,166
Suleyman!

1263
01:40:11,333 --> 01:40:12,541
Suleyman!

1264
01:40:18,125 --> 01:40:20,000
Mr. Suleyman, are you all right?

1265
01:40:21,083 --> 01:40:22,500
Nimet, how are you?

1266
01:40:22,833 --> 01:40:24,958
Are you OK Suleyman?

1267
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,458
<i>47 years later...
</i>-How are you Nimet?

1268
01:40:29,083 --> 01:40:30,291
I'm fine.

<i>Woken by the noise and violent tremors,
citizens poured into the street.</i>

1273
01:40:52,166 --> 01:40:56,166
<i>The worst damage occurred
in Izmit, Adapazari and Eskisehir.</i>

1274
01:40:58,625 --> 01:41:01,041
Some buildings collapsed
in Avcilar as well.

1275

Even Yalova! Yalova is razed too!

1278
01:41:15,791 --> 01:41:17,791
But I don't know how many people.

1279
01:41:21,708 --> 01:41:24,875
Where are you going Mr. Suleyman?
They say do not enter the buildings.

1280
01:41:24,916 --> 01:41:26,500
-Dad!
-We're still shaking.

1281
01:41:26,541 --> 01:41:28,375
Where are you going daddy?

1282
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:30,875
Don't worry,
I'll see what he's up to.

1283
01:41:51,291 --> 01:41:52,458
Suleyman.

1284
01:41:54,416 --> 01:41:56,416
The children are worried.

1285
01:41:56,958 --> 01:41:58,791
She's my child, too.

1286
01:42:02,666 --> 01:42:04,500
Oh, Suleyman.

1287
01:42:09,416 --> 01:42:12,333
When you've survived a war...

1288
01:42:13,208 --> 01:42:15,916
...you don't care about death anymore.

1289
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:20,875
It feels like you've dodged
the Angel of Death.

1290
01:42:22,041 --> 01:42:25,458
It feels like you have many years
ahead of you, but...

1291
01:42:26,916 --> 01:42:28,833
...it's been 50 years.

1292
01:42:32,916 --> 01:42:34,750
We could've died, Nimet.

1293
01:42:37,333 --> 01:42:39,333
But I made a promise.

1294
01:42:41,666 --> 01:42:44,875
I don't want to die
without keeping my promise.

Good for them!
They're truly loyal people.

1300
01:43:11,958 --> 01:43:16,833
Maybe your Ayla has also came out
of loyalty to her father's nation.

1301
01:43:16,875 --> 01:43:18,208

My father found a Korean girl there.

1310
01:44:21,833 --> 01:44:24,375
He's been looking for her for years.

1311
01:44:24,458 --> 01:44:26,916
-But how's he going to find her?
-That's a shame.

01:44:27,166 --> 01:44:29,791
-If only he could go over there.
-But it's hard.

Right, Mom?

1315
01:44:36,583 --> 01:44:39,416
She must be an old woman now.
Who's to say she's still alive?

1316
01:44:39,458 --> 01:44:42,625
I keep saying the same thing.
So does my brother. Time and again!

1317
01:44:42,666 --> 01:44:44,208
But Dad won't listen.

1318
01:44:44,708 --> 01:44:46,583
Don't say that.
He gets upset.

1319
01:44:47,041 --> 01:44:49,000
Maybe she's already dead.

1320
01:44:49,208 --> 01:44:50,500
It's life.

1321
01:44:53,625 --> 01:44:55,458

1322
01:45:26,291 --> 01:45:27,708

A newsperson or someone is
here from Korea.

They're doing interviews at the society
for the 60th anniversary.

1328
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:05,583
They've said they want to help find Ayla.

1329
01:46:07,625 --> 01:46:10,041
They definitely want to talk to us.

1330
01:46:12,458 --> 01:46:14,791
My South Korean colleague,
Sung Joon and I...

1331
01:46:14,833 --> 01:46:18,041
...are working on a documentary
about the Korean War.

1332
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:21,291
As it's the 60th anniversary...
Easy to say.

1333
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:24,958
We're looking at veterans' stories,
what happened there.

1334
01:46:25,541 --> 01:46:28,208
Everyone has been talking about
the action they saw there.

1335
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:30,750
Everyone is talking about
how they shoot people or get shot.

1336
01:46:30,791 --> 01:46:34,208
So I told them... We have a friend called
Suleyman, an NCO.

1337
01:46:34,791 --> 01:46:37,625
He saved a little girl there.

1338
01:46:37,708 --> 01:46:41,541
I was so excited to hear that.
I spoke to my colleague right away.

1339
01:46:41,583 --> 01:46:45,166
We want to make a documentary
of this story and also to trace Ayla.

1340
01:46:51,541 --> 01:46:54,125
If you help us, we'll find Ayla.

1341
01:47:03,333 --> 01:47:05,958
I can't believe you're saying this.

1342
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:10,208
It's all I want in life.

1343
01:47:12,333 --> 01:47:14,375
But they say her name's changed.

1344
01:47:14,416 --> 01:47:17,000
She changed it after leaving school.

1345
01:47:17,041 --> 01:47:18,708
Don't you worry, Mr. Suleyman.

1346
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:22,583
Look, everything's changed now.
There are records, archives.

1347
01:47:23,416 --> 01:47:26,416
But do you have any photos of Ayla?

1348
01:47:26,791 --> 01:47:29,458
Absolutely!
They're all there in my album.

1349
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:32,500
I keep them immaculate.

1350
01:47:32,583 --> 01:47:33,625
There you go.

1351
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,208

They were classmates after all.

1361
01:48:42,625 --> 01:48:44,291
I thought that.

1362
01:48:44,333 --> 01:48:46,541
Here is the interesting list...

1363
01:48:46,708 --> 01:48:49,083
...my assistant is researching it.

1364
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,041
Mr. Sung, there are some striking names
on the list.

1365
01:48:57,958 --> 01:48:59,166
Thanks.

1366
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:05,500
We found those six students
who studied at this school at the time.

1367
01:49:06,083 --> 01:49:08,916
They never lose contact
after graduated.

1368
01:49:09,291 --> 01:49:11,416
They still meet every year.

1369
01:49:13,166 --> 01:49:15,083
I'm sure they remember Ayla.

1370
01:49:15,333 --> 01:49:17,583
Let's meet them as soon as possible.

1371
01:49:17,625 --> 01:49:19,041
Exactly.

1372
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:23,000
Good evening, Mr. Suleyman.

1373
01:49:25,916 --> 01:49:29,333
We've found some graduates
from Ankara School in Korea.

1374
01:49:29,458 --> 01:49:31,458
They were students
at the same time as Ayla.

1375
01:49:36,708 --> 01:49:38,916
They're saying,
"Yes, we remember her."

1376
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:44,416
A Turkish soldier brought her.

1377
01:49:44,541 --> 01:49:47,833
She sat quietly in a corner and
never joined in.

1378
01:49:47,958 --> 01:49:49,541
She never spoke to us.

1379
01:49:51,125 --> 01:49:53,333
She'd say, 'My dad's coming to get me.'

1380
01:49:55,416 --> 01:49:58,250
The teachers taught us all
a Turkish anthem.

1381
01:49:58,375 --> 01:50:00,208
That's when she joined in.

1382
01:50:01,375 --> 01:50:04,875
She'd sit in front
and sing louder than any of us.

1383
01:50:05,291 --> 01:50:06,416
And she'd say...

1384
01:50:06,458 --> 01:50:09,875
'If I learn this anthem well,
my father will be proud of me.'

1385
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,125
<i>Ankara, Ankara, glorious Ankara</i>

1386
01:50:14,541 --> 01:50:18,541
<i>Anyone ill-starred wants to see you</i>

1387
01:50:18,708 --> 01:50:22,583
<i>Anyone in trouble hopes for your help</i>

1388
01:50:22,666 --> 01:50:26,291
<i>You provide for them, glorious Ankara</i>

1389
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,208
<i>Ankara, glorious Ankara</i>

1390
01:50:31,583 --> 01:50:35,791
<i>Anyone ill-starred wants to see you</i>

1391
01:50:36,041 --> 01:50:39,958
<i>Anyone in trouble hopes for your help</i>

1392
01:50:40,541 --> 01:50:44,166
<i>You provide for them, glorious Ankara</i>

1393
01:50:44,833 --> 01:50:47,041
Mr. Suleyman, this is just a start.

1394
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:49,958
We'll find someone
who knows her for sure.

1395
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,416
I mean, even if she isn't alive, w--

1396
01:50:57,875 --> 01:50:58,958
She's alive.

1397
01:50:59,041 --> 01:51:00,625
You said you'd find her alive.

1398
01:51:00,708 --> 01:51:02,541
But now it's all about corpses?

1399
01:51:02,583 --> 01:51:03,625
Sebahat.

1400
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:08,541
If you'll excuse me.

1401
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:13,166
Ms. Ozge.

1402
01:51:13,333 --> 01:51:17,041
Look, you keep coming here
and telling my father stories.

1403
01:51:17,583 --> 01:51:19,583
But my father's heart won't take it.

1404
01:51:19,625 --> 01:51:21,125
Really it won't.

1405
01:51:21,708 --> 01:51:23,958
I don't want this to go any further.

1406
01:51:26,166 --> 01:51:27,791
-I understand.
-Good!

1407
01:51:29,250 --> 01:51:30,458
Sweetheart?

1408
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:34,083
What were you saying there?

1409
01:51:34,333 --> 01:51:35,875
What kind of attitude was that?

1410
01:51:36,166 --> 01:51:37,791
I made a promise.

1411
01:51:38,708 --> 01:51:42,625
Fathers strive for their children and
live for the promises they've made to them.

1412
01:51:42,958 --> 01:51:46,125
Haven't I done that for you and
your brother?

1413
01:51:49,708 --> 01:51:51,125
Is it about me?

1414
01:51:53,458 --> 01:51:55,750
Are you afraid I'll die?

1415
01:51:56,333 --> 01:51:58,333
Bless you, my love.

1416
01:52:01,625 --> 01:52:02,916
Don't be afraid.

1417
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,500
I won't die until my promise is kept.

1418
01:52:15,875 --> 01:52:17,291
-Hi.
<i>-Hello Ozge.</i>

1419
01:52:18,416 --> 01:52:19,958
We found Ayla.

1420
01:52:20,041 --> 01:52:22,125
We finally found her this time.

1421
01:52:22,166 --> 01:52:23,750
-Really?
<i>-Yes.</i>

1422
01:52:24,041 --> 01:52:25,583
<i>It's a great news.</i>

1423
01:52:25,625 --> 01:52:28,500
<i>But there are other things
we need to talk first.</i>

1424
01:52:28,541 --> 01:52:31,625
Okey. I call you from my office.

1425
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,416
We reached a graduated.

1426
01:52:33,458 --> 01:52:36,333
She said, Ayla saw her sister
on to her twenties.

1427
01:52:36,375 --> 01:52:38,708
She said, her name was Kim Eunja.

1428
01:52:38,916 --> 01:52:40,708
Are you sure?
Is she Ayla?

1429
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:42,416
Her misfortune so similar.

1430
01:52:42,458 --> 01:52:45,291
We did some research.
<i>The woman had a marriage.</i>

1431
01:52:45,333 --> 01:52:48,916
<i>Unfortunately her husband died
at a young age.</i>

1432
01:52:49,333 --> 01:52:50,625
<i>Look at that.</i>

1433
01:52:50,666 --> 01:52:52,083
<i>It's her picture.</i>

1434
01:52:53,541 --> 01:52:56,083
Poor woman.
She never had a life.

1435
01:52:56,166 --> 01:52:57,625
She is efforts to work.

1436
01:52:57,666 --> 01:53:01,041
She wanna be self sufficient
<i>and not be bother on anyone.</i>

1437
01:53:01,083 --> 01:53:03,000
She does cleaning work at school.

1438
01:53:03,041 --> 01:53:05,208
What do you think?
Shall we tell that Suleyman.

1439
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:07,750
His daughter caused a lot of trouble today.

1440
01:53:07,875 --> 01:53:09,625
And she has her reasons.

1441
01:53:09,666 --> 01:53:12,333
Look, the photos are incredible similar.

1442
01:53:12,375 --> 01:53:14,166
<i>We should try in any case.</i>

1443
01:53:14,208 --> 01:53:16,208
<i>We can't leave this here.</i>

1444
01:53:17,041 --> 01:53:18,291
Fine.

1445
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:20,500
I'll catch the first flights.

1446
01:53:20,541 --> 01:53:22,750
Arrange a meeting with that woman.

1447
01:53:23,125 --> 01:53:24,708
<i>Let's go and meet her.</i>

1448
01:53:25,375 --> 01:53:28,666
<i>If she remembers Mr. Suleyman
after all these years....</i>

1449
01:53:28,750 --> 01:53:31,041
<i>...and feels like get in together...</i>

1450
01:53:31,416 --> 01:53:33,750
<i>...it will be worth our efforts...</i>

1451
01:53:33,791 --> 01:53:36,083
<i>...if these two people reunite.</i>

1452
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:37,208
Come in.

1453
01:55:39,958 --> 01:55:41,250
That's right.

1454
01:55:42,958 --> 01:55:44,041
Daddy...

1455
01:55:46,916 --> 01:55:48,125
Daddy...

1456
01:55:48,416 --> 01:55:50,166
Daddy. Daddy.

1457
01:55:54,083 --> 01:55:57,500
How could I forget my father?

1458
01:56:13,708 --> 01:56:17,000
Is he still alive?

1459
01:56:20,541 --> 01:56:23,375
Daddy...

1460
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:34,708
<i>Seoul
April, 2010</i>

1461
01:56:54,041 --> 01:56:56,166
Seoul has gotten so big.

1462
01:56:58,958 --> 01:57:00,958
Who knows how my Ayla...

1463
01:57:06,041 --> 01:57:08,458
She's been through so much, Nimet.

1464
01:57:11,125 --> 01:57:12,750
I couldn't be there for her.

1465
01:58:29,208 --> 01:58:30,833
Isn't that Ayla?

1466
01:59:01,208 --> 01:59:02,416
Daddy!

1467
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:06,083
Daddy.

1468
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:15,458
Daddy.

1469
01:59:16,125 --> 01:59:17,333
Daddy.

1470
01:59:19,250 --> 01:59:22,625
Fathers strive for their children.

1471
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:26,541
They live for the promises
they've made to them.

1472
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:28,500
I promise.

1473
01:59:44,833 --> 01:59:47,625
<i>After 60 years Suleyman and his daughter
reunited in Seoul on April th10th. 2010...</i>

1474
01:59:47,666 --> 01:59:49,000
<i>...and never separated after.</i>

1475
01:59:49,041 --> 01:59:50,500
<i>According to the Unicef reports...</i>

1476
01:59:50,541 --> 01:59:52,666
<i>...there are 28 million war-weary children
like Ayla all over the world.</i>

1477
01:59:52,708 --> 01:59:54,250
<i>1,5 million of them are living with us
in our country.</i>

1478
01:59:57,583 --> 01:59:59,625
Isn't that Ayla coming?

1479
02:00:38,875 --> 02:00:41,208
Dear Daddy.

1480
02:00:43,291 --> 02:00:49,125
It's like as if I've seen you
just yesterday.

1481
02:00:50,791 --> 02:00:55,666
I can still feel
your callous hands.

1482
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:04,833
We have to live long.

1483
02:01:08,083 --> 02:01:12,375
I wonder about you every second.

1484
02:01:12,416 --> 02:01:15,750
I thank you for raising
a little girl who left...

1485
02:01:15,791 --> 02:01:19,958
...in the middle of war and
accept her as your own.

1486
02:01:21,541 --> 02:01:23,791
I love, daddy.

1487
02:01:28,458 --> 02:01:31,250
Take care of yourself.

1488
02:01:33,916 --> 02:01:36,000
Your daughter...

1489
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:38,250
...Ayla.
