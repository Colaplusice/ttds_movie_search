1
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,092
He's clean.

2
00:02:48,437 --> 00:02:49,219
So...

3
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:51,935
Why are you here? Hm?

4
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:45,326
<i>There was a time.</i>

5
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:00,931
4:35.

6
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:04,145
You misunderstood.

7
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:08,232
I wasn't asking for the time,
I was just saying, "There was a time."

8
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:12,235
There was a time?

9
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:13,952
Mm-hm.

10
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:16,410
Take brown sugar back there, for example.

11
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,659
<i>She's pretty fucking foxy, right?</i>

12
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:22,631
She's 70.

13
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:24,755
If she's a day.

14
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:26,385
But there was a time.

15
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:31,013
- I don't follow.
- The name's Smith. I'm from out of town.

16
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,141
- Listen, Mr Smith...
- Just Smith.

17
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,732
The reason I'm in town,
in case you're wondering...

18
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:41,733
...is because of a Kansas City Shuffle.

19
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:44,443
What's a Kansas City Shuffle?

20
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:50,157
Kansas City Shuffle is
when everybody looks right and you go left.

21
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,289
- Never heard of it.
- Hm.

22
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:54,536
It's not something people hear about.

23
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,417
Falls on deaf ears mostly.

24
00:05:58,177 --> 00:06:01,546
But this particular one's
been over 20 years in the making.

25
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,133
<i>20 years, huh?</i>

26
00:06:03,224 --> 00:06:05,264
No small matter.

27
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:10,188
Requires a lot of planning.

28
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,400
It involves a lot of people.

29
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,234
People connected only
by the slightest of events.

30
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:20,366
Like whispers in the night...

31
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:25,287
...in that place that never forgets
even when those people do.

32
00:06:31,843 --> 00:06:34,133
It all starts with a horse.

33
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:41,561
<i>It's what they called back then
a drugstore handicap.</i>

34
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:46,779
<i>A guy wants what the fella calls a sure thing,
so he schemes to make it so.</i>

35
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:52,900
<i>He calls in the doc, a nobbler from Antwerp
known for his savvy but not for his discretion.</i>

36
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,574
<i>WOMA N: Oh, fuck me, baby, fuck me, baby.</i>

37
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,872
<i>The same could be said
for Doc'sjelly on the side - Gloria.</i>

38
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:03,538
- Almost there, almost there.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

39
00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:06,090
Hey, which horse did you say
it was again, baby?

40
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:19,569
<i>Which brings us to Abe, because Gloria
was too muchjelly for one outfit.</i>

41
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:22,695
Hey, baby, is your wife around?

42
00:07:22,782 --> 00:07:25,026
<i>- What do you want?
WOMA N: Who is it, Abe?</i>

43
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:27,827
<i>Ah... it's Seymour.</i>

44
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:32,162
<i>GLORIA: Sure, tell that bitch to open her eyes,
mayb e then she'd see more.</i>

45
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:34,293
Seymour says hello.

46
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,955
What are you doing calling me here?

47
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:40,635
Christmas came early this year, baby.
I got a present for you.

48
00:07:40,722 --> 00:07:42,383
Remember my friend Doc?

49
00:07:42,474 --> 00:07:46,093
<i>SMITH: Now Abe wasn't a nosy fella,
but he had a nose.</i>

50
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:49,229
<i>And right below his nose was his mouth.</i>

51
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:52,352
<i>ABE: Do you remember Gloria the hooker?</i>

52
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:57,322
Well, Gloria's got this friend Doc
who's got a line on a doped-up racehorse.

53
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,450
<i>The fix is in at Aqueduct.</i>

54
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:01,864
- Seventh horse. Tenth race.
- Doped up?

55
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,745
<i>SMITH:
And then there was thisjoker who had ears...</i>

56
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:07,212
<i>ABE: Let's get back.</i>

57
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:09,623
<i>SMITH: ... who looked like somebody's uncle.</i>

58
00:08:09,717 --> 00:08:11,757
Max, who's your favourite uncle?

59
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:14,088
OK, who's your second favourite uncle?

60
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:16,009
Just pay attention.

61
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,928
I got something here.

62
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:21,804
<i>SMITH: And before you know it,
folks are getting a big dose of the gimmies,</i>

63
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,437
<i>and men start talking their hats off.</i>

64
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:29,274
<i>And that Manischewitz Grapevine Wine spills in
your ear and tells you you got a sure thing,</i>

65
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,905
<i>and what's worse is, you start to believe it.</i>

66
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:34,905
<i>At least that's how it went with old Max,</i>

67
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:37,158
<i>who wasn't so much old, as he was tired.</i>

68
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:40,085
<i>Tired of being a dog without a day.</i>

69
00:08:40,172 --> 00:08:43,589
<i>Tired of waking up and finding
that his dreams were only dreams.</i>

70
00:08:43,677 --> 00:08:44,957
We're leaving.

71
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:48,719
<i>But mostly,
Max was tired of not having a front lawn.</i>

72
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:50,766
Make sure he doesn't come home late.

73
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:53,344
- I will.
- I was talking to your son.

74
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:55,812
- (Giggles)
- You think that's funny, do you?

75
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,609
Uh-huh. Bye, Mom.

76
00:08:57,694 --> 00:08:59,936
Yeah. Bye, Mom!

77
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,275
Love you.

78
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,905
<i>TANNOY: They're off.</i>

79
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,172
All right, if your ma asks,
where were we today?

80
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:15,668
- Shea Stadium.
- To see?

81
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,761
- Mets v Phillies.
- Good man. Give me the post-game.

82
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:21,598
Stallard gave up six runs in the first five innings.

83
00:09:21,683 --> 00:09:26,013
Ed Kranepool hit a line drive down right field
but it hit the wall, fouled by a foot.

84
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:28,478
Gonder hit a groundball
between first and second

85
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,853
but he's so slow, second baseman
Tony Taylor tagged him out at first.

86
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,237
Did you get all that from the radio?

87
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,523
Mm -hm.

88
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,278
You're good.

89
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,280
OK, I'll be right back.

90
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:42,746
No, no, no. You've got to stay in the car.

91
00:09:42,835 --> 00:09:44,460
Why?

92
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:47,547
Because they don't let little boys inside the track.

93
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,339
Saul's dad takes him to the track.

94
00:09:50,427 --> 00:09:52,753
Well, Saul's dad is a degenerate gambler.

95
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:56,264
And if you're the son of a degenerate gambler,
they let you in.

96
00:09:56,352 --> 00:09:58,392
It's economically viable.

97
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,805
Are you going to be a degenerate gambler?

98
00:10:01,942 --> 00:10:04,148
Hey. You know better than that.

99
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,192
Your old man's smart.
He only plays a sure thing.

100
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,030
Look.
This money's gonna get you through Harvard.

101
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:14,950
And you're gonna be a doctor.

102
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,370
But until then...

103
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,454
you've got to stay in the car.

104
00:10:20,883 --> 00:10:22,923
Hey.

105
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,965
Next weekend, you and me go to a ballgame.

106
00:10:26,055 --> 00:10:27,883
- OK.
- OK.

107
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:29,766
I love you, kid.

108
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:31,513
I love you too, Dad.

109
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,270
Wait, watch. Watch, watch, watch.

110
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:36,398
I almost forgot. 15 minutes.

111
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:38,525
Start counting.

112
00:10:42,702 --> 00:10:45,906
<i>TANNOY:
The next race at the Aqueduct is the tenth race.</i>

113
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:58,129
<i>- Come on, come on.
TANNOY: The field is making towards</i>

114
00:10:58,221 --> 00:11:02,801
<i>the final turn, and Number Seven has moved
into fifth position on the outside.</i>

115
00:11:02,894 --> 00:11:05,350
<i>- Number Two has the lead...
- (Cheering)</i>

116
00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:07,063
Come on.

117
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:10,066
<i>Number One is against the rail.</i>

118
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:14,068
<i>And Number Seven is beginning
to pick up the pace on the outside.</i>

119
00:11:14,158 --> 00:11:15,273
Yes!

120
00:11:15,368 --> 00:11:17,242
<i>Yes, come on, baby, come on!</i>

121
00:11:18,872 --> 00:11:21,447
- Let's go!
- (Cheering intensifies)

122
00:11:21,543 --> 00:11:26,289
<i>... to challenge, goes clear
and Number Seven takes the lead!</i>

123
00:11:26,382 --> 00:11:28,375
<i>It's Number Seven who now has the lead.</i>

124
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:30,674
<i>It's strolling clear.</i>

125
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:31,711
Yes!

126
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:34,973
Oh!

127
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:39,477
<i>Number Seven has fallen!</i>

128
00:11:42,026 --> 00:11:44,518
<i>Number One comes home
and takes the lead to win it.</i>

129
00:11:44,614 --> 00:11:48,030
<i>SMITH: Max woke up to find his dreams
hadjust been the stuff of pipes.</i>

130
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:50,158
- I want to place a bet.
- How much?

131
00:11:50,245 --> 00:11:51,526
20 large.

132
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:55,038
Oh, you must feel real lucky.

133
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:57,706
<i>I'll take your bet.</i>

134
00:11:57,797 --> 00:11:59,624
And lay it off.

135
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:01,424
I've got a bookie's bookie.

136
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:04,338
I'll give you 2-1 on the horse.

137
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,099
Uh-uh. The racing form says 9-1.

138
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:11,223
So you go to a ticket vendor
with your 20 grand in hand,

139
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,232
and you get 9-1 if the spread sticks.

140
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:18,150
You come in here with your pockets turned out,
you get 2-1.

141
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:20,481
The juice is ten.

142
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:24,989
That means if you lose, you're all in for 22 grand.

143
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:27,121
20 for the bet, two for the juice.

144
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,910
Can you pay these monies? Huh? Can you?

145
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:34,633
Yeah.

146
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:42,014
<i>Just to be clear,</i>

147
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:43,727
<i>if you lose...</i>

148
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:47,769
...you're gonna owe a lot of money
to the kind of men

149
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,986
you do not want to owe
the smallest amount of money to.

150
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,174
Henry!

151
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:10,459
Henry!

152
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:15,929
Henry!

153
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,065
Henry!

154
00:13:21,777 --> 00:13:23,817
Hey, buddy. You got a light?

155
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,945
No. Henry!

156
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:29,403
In that case, how about the 20 Gs
you just blew on the Seven horse?

157
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:32,746
- What have you done with my son?
- He's on his way home. Just like you.

158
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:33,829
Urgh!

159
00:13:42,595 --> 00:13:44,422
Where am I?

160
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,015
Roth, he'll tell you everything, I swear.

161
00:13:57,739 --> 00:13:59,779
He already has.

162
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,202
Please.

163
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:10,376
I have a family.

164
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:14,418
<i>Please.</i>

165
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:16,219
<i>Please!</i>

166
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:18,048
<i>Where's my boy?</i>

167
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:21,762
<i>Henry!</i>

168
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:27,978
<i>Where are they?</i>

169
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,280
<i>Henry!</i>

170
00:14:35,662 --> 00:14:36,943
<i>Henry!</i>

171
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,924
Fuck.

172
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,430
Shit.

173
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,015
Jesus.

174
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:59,099
"Fuck, shit, Jesus" is right.

175
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:02,267
I don't understand.
Why did they kill Max's family?

176
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:04,190
New outfit in town.

177
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:08,568
They didn't want somebody else
betting on a fixed horserace with them.

178
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:12,079
Trying to make an impression.

179
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:15,792
That's a fucking story, man.

180
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,424
Charlie Chaplin entered a Charlie Chaplin
look-a-like contest in Monte Carlo

181
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,550
and came in third.

182
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:24,678
Now that's a story.

183
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:28,934
This...

184
00:15:29,021 --> 00:15:31,061
This is something else.

185
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:33,189
So that's a Kansas City Shuffle?

186
00:15:33,277 --> 00:15:34,652
No.

187
00:15:34,737 --> 00:15:36,776
It's just the inciting incident.

188
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:39,905
The catalyst.

189
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:44,281
This - is a Kansas City Shuffle.

190
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,749
<i>They lookright...</i>

191
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:49,995
And you...

192
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:52,129
go left.

193
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:01,349
Sorry about that, son.

194
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:05,226
Sometimes there's more to life than just living.

195
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:09,818
Besides... you can't have a Kansas City Shuffle
without a body.

196
00:17:08,856 --> 00:17:10,896
<i>- He's down!
- Get the roof!</i>

197
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:12,810
<i>Up there!</i>

198
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:09,762
I'm coming!

199
00:18:11,977 --> 00:18:13,602
Coming.

200
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:19,565
It took you long enough.

201
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:22,191
You're not Nick.

202
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:24,690
You're not as tall as I thought you'd be.

203
00:18:24,785 --> 00:18:26,825
Well, I'm short for my height.

204
00:18:28,581 --> 00:18:32,330
That makes sense because I can usually
tell how tall someone is by their knock.

205
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:35,587
You have a deceptively tall knock.
Congratulations.

206
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:38,043
So it's a good thing?

207
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:42,339
I open the door expecting you to be up here,
you're down here.

208
00:18:42,431 --> 00:18:45,848
That combined with a low centre of gravity -
forget about it.

209
00:18:45,936 --> 00:18:47,680
Who are you?

210
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:49,267
I'm Slevin.

211
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:51,434
And what happened to your nose?

212
00:18:52,403 --> 00:18:54,561
I was using it to break some guy's fist.

213
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:56,695
Somebody hit you?

214
00:18:56,783 --> 00:18:58,942
Yeah... I was kind of expecting it, though.

215
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:00,697
You were kind of expecting it?

216
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:03,245
Well, they say bad things happen in threes.

217
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:07,955
<i>First... I lost myjob.</i>

218
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:11,381
<i>Then I came home to find
my apartment building had been condemned</i>

219
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:15,135
<i>due to a hyb rid breed
of Ecuadorian Super Termites.</i>

220
00:19:15,223 --> 00:19:17,263
<i>So I went to my girlfriend Kelly's.</i>

221
00:19:18,352 --> 00:19:20,475
<i>I had a key so I let myself in.</i>

222
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:34,241
- Hey, don't stop on my account.
- Oh shit!

223
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:38,078
Slevin.

224
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:40,078
It was an accident.

225
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:42,707
What, like he tripped and you fell?

226
00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:48,552
<i>MA N: Slevin, do you know what time it is?</i>

227
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,595
I'm at the airport,
are you sure you want me to come out?

228
00:19:51,686 --> 00:19:55,056
<i>Yeah, two weeks in New York
and the only Kelly you'll remember</i>

229
00:19:55,148 --> 00:19:58,933
<i>is the Kelly who gave you your first handjob
on the bus to summer camp.</i>

230
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:01,900
Kelly Perkins. Said her hands were dry
and she needed...

231
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:05,692
<i>She said that to a lot of guys,
that's why we called her Jerkins Perkins.</i>

232
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,457
<i>- Just call me when you land, all right?
- Yeah.</i>

233
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:21,005
Yeah, I just got into town, Nick.
I'm on my way over to your place.

234
00:20:21,098 --> 00:20:23,138
Say, man, you got the time?

235
00:20:23,225 --> 00:20:26,512
Ya, man, it's uh... 7:23.

236
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:28,645
So you're probably still asleep?

237
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:31,307
- Yo, you got a smoke?
- No, I don't smoke, man.

238
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:35,864
<i>Why don't youjust go ahead and give me
your wallet and I'll buy my own smokes?</i>

239
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:37,492
Am I being mugged?

240
00:20:39,496 --> 00:20:40,492
Man!

241
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:42,538
And so here I am.

242
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:45,958
You said three.

243
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:48,371
- What?
- You said bad things happen in threes.

244
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:52,334
You lost your job, your apartment was
condemned, Kelly was cheating on you

245
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:54,256
<i>and you got mugged - that makes four.</i>

246
00:20:54,348 --> 00:20:56,306
When you're on a roll, you're on a roll.

247
00:20:56,392 --> 00:20:58,219
Interesting, although I would add,

248
00:20:58,311 --> 00:21:01,147
not the ever so clever hold-up man
one hears so much about.

249
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:04,566
- Well, he did break my nose.
- But overlooked your suitcase.

250
00:21:04,653 --> 00:21:06,776
Maybe it wouldn't make for a speedy getaway.

251
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:09,984
True, but then there's the matter of your watch.
Pretty fancy.

252
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:11,986
- It's a fake.
- But he didn't know that.

253
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:14,914
- Maybe he didn't see it.
- He saw it. He asked you for the time.

254
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:17,040
You say this was your third mugging?

255
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:18,752
Uh... I travel a lot.

256
00:21:18,837 --> 00:21:20,665
Where's Nick?

257
00:21:20,756 --> 00:21:23,960
I don't know. He was supposed to
meet me here. He never showed up.

258
00:21:24,052 --> 00:21:26,009
<i>- How did you get in?
- Door was open.</i>

259
00:21:26,096 --> 00:21:28,255
- Door was open?
- Yeah.

260
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:30,592
- Open or unlocked?
- I don't remember.

261
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:33,771
- You said open.
- Could have been. What was your name again?

262
00:21:33,856 --> 00:21:35,896
Lindsey. I live across the hall.

263
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:38,309
- Oh.
- I came over to borrow a cup of sugar.

264
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:40,811
<i>- Where's your cup?
- I came to borrow a cup of sugar.</i>

265
00:21:40,907 --> 00:21:43,066
If I had a cup, I'd have come to borrow sugar.

266
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,868
- Touch.
- (Phone rings)

267
00:21:44,954 --> 00:21:47,492
Maybe that's Nick. It's right there.

268
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,329
Hello?

269
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:52,247
Hello?

270
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:56,381
They hung up.

271
00:21:56,468 --> 00:21:59,838
I have an idea. Have you used the phone
since you've been here?

272
00:21:59,931 --> 00:22:01,971
No, except for that.

273
00:22:02,851 --> 00:22:04,476
Sorry, wrong number.

274
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:06,354
That was the Hotel Cheval.

275
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:08,313
What are you doing?

276
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,310
We know who he called. Who called him?

277
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:12,728
- Columbo says three things...
- Columbo?

278
00:22:12,822 --> 00:22:16,108
Yeah, Columbo was this TV detective
played by Peter Falk...

279
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,528
I know who Columbo is. Yeah.

280
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:20,614
He looked for three things at a crime scene.

281
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:24,159
What's there now that wasn't before.
What was there before that isn't now.

282
00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:26,579
- And what's been moved.
- Is this a crime scene?

283
00:22:26,673 --> 00:22:28,630
- I think Nick's in trouble.
- Ah.

284
00:22:28,717 --> 00:22:30,128
Sorry, wrong number.

285
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:32,259
That was the Hotel Cheval again!

286
00:22:32,347 --> 00:22:36,215
So what? He called the hotel,
the hotel called him back. Makes sense.

287
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,721
So, maybe it's a clue.

288
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:41,180
- A clue to what?
- A clue to what happened to Nick.

289
00:22:41,274 --> 00:22:44,609
<i>- We don't know anything did.
- We don't know anything didn't.</i>

290
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:48,196
You're here, he's not. The door was open.
Bad things happen where you...

291
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,276
Shit. I've got to stop by work.

292
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,237
Just for a couple of hours. I'll come back,
then we can start the investigation.

293
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,784
- The investigation?
- Uh-huh. It'll be fun.

294
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:58,709
OK.

295
00:23:01,925 --> 00:23:03,965
I totally forgot...

296
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,637
Yeah.

297
00:23:08,518 --> 00:23:09,514
Sorry.

298
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:12,094
- May I borrow a cup of sugar?
- What?

299
00:23:12,981 --> 00:23:16,018
<i>I never gave it much thought
until I put up a fresh pot of coffee.</i>

300
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,946
I was on my way to the store
and I thought Nick'd have sugar.

301
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,569
You tell me your story, I leave, sugarless.

302
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:23,818
I come back, you put your penis on exhibition.

303
00:23:23,912 --> 00:23:27,910
Although the coffee's probably gone bad
by now, I insist on following through.

304
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,289
It's like a Norman Rockwell painting.

305
00:23:30,378 --> 00:23:31,576
What, my penis?

306
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:34,210
No. No, the sugar.

307
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,922
<i>Neighbours borrowing sugar from one another.</i>

308
00:23:37,012 --> 00:23:38,969
It's very um... Andy Griffith.

309
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:40,844
Yeah.

310
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:43,851
<i>That's Andy Griffith.
The penis thing is not very Mayberry.</i>

311
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:45,562
No.

312
00:23:45,648 --> 00:23:47,688
Thanks for the sugar... sugar.

313
00:23:56,953 --> 00:23:59,492
I wanted to try and catch the next show.

314
00:23:59,582 --> 00:24:01,160
I don't go on again till eight.

315
00:24:08,092 --> 00:24:09,088
Whew!

316
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:18,351
It's not nearly eight o'clock yet.

317
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:22,517
- The Boss wants to see you.
- Who...?

318
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:24,521
- The Boss.
- Who's The Boss?

319
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:26,820
- The guy we work for.
- Jesus!

320
00:24:27,617 --> 00:24:29,943
Come here and sit your punk ass down.

321
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:32,034
Go.

322
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,126
I'm not the guy you're looking for.
I don't live here.

323
00:24:36,211 --> 00:24:38,251
Well, you look like the guy that lives here.

324
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:40,795
Then you don't know what he looks like.

325
00:24:40,884 --> 00:24:42,841
He means to say you look like you live here.

326
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:45,135
Yeah, that's what I mean to say.

327
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:47,263
I look like I live here, but I don't.

328
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:49,924
I'm just visiting, I just got in this morning.

329
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,390
The cat I'm looking for, his name is uh...

330
00:24:53,483 --> 00:24:55,939
- His name is Nick, man.
- Nick.

331
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,067
The cat's name is Nick. Now...

332
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:01,324
Who are you?

333
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,785
I'm Slevin.

334
00:25:04,455 --> 00:25:06,282
You got some ID?

335
00:25:09,544 --> 00:25:12,215
The funny thing about that is
I got mugged this morning.

336
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:13,877
Look, look.

337
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:15,795
Tell it to the One Legged Man.

338
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:17,926
So he can bump it off down the road.

339
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,064
- Hey, listen, motherfucker...
- Yo, I got this.

340
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:32,646
- Slow, slow, slow, slow your roll, man.
- I got this.

341
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,983
Just let me. Just let me, all right?

342
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:37,035
Motherfucker!

343
00:25:37,122 --> 00:25:40,076
All I know is,
The Boss slides me this here address,

344
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:42,207
and he says, "Sloe" - that's him.

345
00:25:42,294 --> 00:25:43,919
"Elvis" - that's me.

346
00:25:44,005 --> 00:25:46,627
"Bring me the cat
who resides at this here address."

347
00:25:46,716 --> 00:25:48,294
Now he told me that today.

348
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:50,842
You just so happen to be here today.

349
00:25:50,931 --> 00:25:54,217
So I guess you the cat I'm supposed to pick up.

350
00:25:55,061 --> 00:25:56,057
Today.

351
00:25:56,145 --> 00:25:57,770
But I'm not Nick.

352
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,599
Yeah, well, unfortunately for you,

353
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,943
you're not the first cat to tell me
you wasn't the guy I was looking for.

354
00:26:03,822 --> 00:26:06,859
You can ask Lindsey, she lives across the hall.
She lives here.

355
00:26:06,951 --> 00:26:09,240
Hold on, man, I ain't asking nobody nothing.

356
00:26:09,328 --> 00:26:11,820
Nick, Slevin, Clark Kent -
whatever your name is.

357
00:26:11,915 --> 00:26:14,870
The Virgin Mary could come waltzing up
with her fine ass,

358
00:26:14,961 --> 00:26:16,705
titties hanging out and everything.

359
00:26:16,797 --> 00:26:21,590
If she told me your name was Jesus Christ, I
still gotta take you to see The Boss. Know why?

360
00:26:21,677 --> 00:26:22,709
No.

361
00:26:22,804 --> 00:26:24,844
Orders.

362
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:27,258
Now, you do know what orders is, right?

363
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,641
<i>Orders is orders.</i>

364
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:35,435
So I guess no-one ever taught you not to use
the word you're defining in the definition?

365
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:44,242
Say something else, I will break
your motherfucking nose. I ain't playing.

366
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,080
My nose is already broken.

367
00:26:53,885 --> 00:26:55,925
<i>- Can I just say one more thing?
- What?</i>

368
00:26:56,013 --> 00:26:58,586
Can you turn the heat up in here
cos it's really cold?

369
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:01,304
Uh... yeah.

370
00:27:01,394 --> 00:27:05,524
Y-You... You should have thought about that
before you started in with all the lip.

371
00:27:35,562 --> 00:27:38,018
SLEVIN: Ah, Jeez. (Sighs)

372
00:27:49,872 --> 00:27:52,992
- It's cold out there.
- Let's hurry it up, man.

373
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,891
Yo, grab his ass.

374
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,898
<i>The boss is right up there, chump.</i>

375
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:36,674
Well, listen.

376
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:39,552
Your boys Elvis and Sloe
picked up the wrong guy.

377
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:42,809
<i>- I'm not Nick Fisher.
- Mr Fisher?</i>

378
00:28:44,608 --> 00:28:47,064
Are you familiar with The Shmoo, Mr Fisher?

379
00:28:48,154 --> 00:28:50,194
A comic strip I liked as a boy.

380
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:53,405
The Shmoo was a loveable creature, really.

381
00:28:53,494 --> 00:28:55,321
<i>Laid eggs...</i>

382
00:28:56,123 --> 00:28:58,163
gave milk...

383
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:02,455
...and died of sheer ecstasy
when looked at with hunger.

384
00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:06,547
The Shmoo loved to be eaten.

385
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:08,878
It could taste like any food you desire.

386
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:13,515
Shmoo hide, cut thin, made fine leather.

387
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,101
<i>Even Shmoo whiskers
made excellent toothpicks.</i>

388
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:22,902
In essence, the Shmoo supplied
all of the world's wants.

389
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:29,077
I only bring up the Shmoo because it's relevant
to you and why you were brought here.

390
00:29:29,164 --> 00:29:30,539
I'm sorry, who are you?

391
00:29:30,624 --> 00:29:32,166
I'm The Boss.

392
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:34,043
I thought he was The Boss.

393
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,876
Why?

394
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:38,251
Do we look alike?

395
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:43,597
So, Mr Fisher...
you were gonna tell me something?

396
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,723
I don't know, you brought me here.

397
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,186
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

398
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,310
Back when you thought I was him.

399
00:29:50,065 --> 00:29:52,521
I never thought you were him.
I thought he was you.

400
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,695
I was trying to tell him, you...
that they picked up the wrong guy.

401
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,273
- Wrong guy for what?
- What you wanted to see me about.

402
00:29:58,368 --> 00:30:00,444
- Know what I wanted to see you about?
- No.

403
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:02,577
Then how do you know I have the wrong guy?

404
00:30:02,665 --> 00:30:05,951
- Because I'm not...
- Maybe I wanted to give you $96,000.

405
00:30:06,044 --> 00:30:08,120
In that case, do I still have the wrong guy?

406
00:30:09,423 --> 00:30:11,547
Do you want to give me $96,000?

407
00:30:11,634 --> 00:30:14,719
<i>No, do you want to give me $96,000?</i>

408
00:30:14,805 --> 00:30:16,216
No, should I?

409
00:30:16,307 --> 00:30:18,300
I don't know, should you?

410
00:30:20,645 --> 00:30:22,686
I don't know, should I?

411
00:30:28,072 --> 00:30:29,732
Long story short.

412
00:30:30,658 --> 00:30:34,787
- I think we're well past that point.
- I'll bet it was that mouth that got you that nose.

413
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:42,877
OK, I'm under the impression that you're
under the impression that I owe you $96,000.

414
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:45,421
No, you owe Slim Hopkins $96,000.

415
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,511
You owe Slim, Slim owes me.

416
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:51,767
You owe me.

417
00:30:57,275 --> 00:30:59,315
<i>Well, in that case, is Slim around?</i>

418
00:31:04,284 --> 00:31:07,369
Hey, Slim. Do you know this cat?

419
00:31:09,582 --> 00:31:10,578
Slim?

420
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:13,997
No use.

421
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:18,418
Ever since somebody shot him,
old Slim went deaf.

422
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:21,551
What happened to make Slim go deaf?

423
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:22,919
Why?

424
00:31:24,768 --> 00:31:29,396
Because I owe you $96,000 and I might have
a slight problem coming up with the money.

425
00:31:29,482 --> 00:31:30,893
Oh, OK.

426
00:31:30,984 --> 00:31:34,484
Well, why don't we just make it an even 90?

427
00:31:36,574 --> 00:31:38,817
I may have exaggerated the slightness.

428
00:31:40,747 --> 00:31:41,743
Hm.

429
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:46,459
Well, why don't I just cancel the whole debt
in exchange for a small favour?

430
00:31:49,925 --> 00:31:51,965
Well, that depends on the favour.

431
00:31:55,307 --> 00:31:57,134
<i>THE BOSS: That was my son.</i>

432
00:31:58,227 --> 00:32:00,267
Notice how I said "was"?

433
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,189
Yeah.

434
00:32:03,275 --> 00:32:05,315
That's because he's dead.

435
00:32:06,404 --> 00:32:08,397
Murdered.

436
00:32:10,242 --> 00:32:12,282
Relegated to the past tense.

437
00:32:14,414 --> 00:32:18,283
<i>Sent from an is to a was
before he'd had his breakfast.</i>

438
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:21,206
Bummer.

439
00:32:27,806 --> 00:32:29,846
Lex Talionis.

440
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:32,306
The Law of Retaliation.

441
00:32:47,998 --> 00:32:50,038
<i>A pact was broken.</i>

442
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:53,959
My son was murdered,
so The Rabbi's son must share the same fate.

443
00:32:54,882 --> 00:32:56,507
Whose son?

444
00:32:56,592 --> 00:32:58,300
The Rabbi's.

445
00:32:58,386 --> 00:33:00,426
Why do they call him The Rabbi?

446
00:33:00,513 --> 00:33:01,889
Because...

447
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:06,389
Because he's a rabbi.

448
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,520
Who's his son?

449
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:11,277
- Yitzchok.
- Yitzchok. Yitzchok and The Rabbi.

450
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:13,437
Yitzchok the Fairy.

451
00:33:14,865 --> 00:33:16,906
Why do they call him The Fairy?

452
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,328
Because he's a fairy.

453
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:25,833
He has wings, can fly?
Sprinkles magic dust all over the place?

454
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,960
- He's homosexual.
- Right.

455
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,089
Come on.

456
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:36,052
- So how does The Rabbi feel about that?
- He doesn't know.

457
00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:38,384
- You know, but he doesn't?
- Everybody knows.

458
00:33:38,478 --> 00:33:40,305
- Except The Rabbi.
- That's right.

459
00:33:41,148 --> 00:33:43,189
So where do I fit in?

460
00:33:43,276 --> 00:33:44,937
You?

461
00:33:46,405 --> 00:33:48,445
You're the trigger man.

462
00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:51,410
Me?

463
00:33:51,494 --> 00:33:53,321
You.

464
00:34:00,297 --> 00:34:04,426
Aren't there professionals?
People you can hire to do this sort of thing?

465
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,214
Of course there are.

466
00:34:07,307 --> 00:34:08,303
Yes.

467
00:34:09,392 --> 00:34:11,432
But you owe me $96,000.

468
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,649
Why should I go out and pay someone else
when I've already paid you?

469
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:21,940
Hm. Sorry, kid,
but your money just isn't long enough.

470
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:23,576
Which means you're in my pocket.

471
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,413
Which means
if you don't do what I want you to do,

472
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,071
you're gonna go from my pocket to my fridge.

473
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,210
Slim could use the company.

474
00:34:33,298 --> 00:34:35,172
I could use the Shmoo.

475
00:34:35,258 --> 00:34:37,417
So I'll expect your answer by morning.

476
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:41,094
Is there anything else?

477
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:45,558
Well, I don't suppose I have to say anything
as trite and clichd as,

478
00:34:45,647 --> 00:34:47,853
"Go to the police and you're a dead man."

479
00:34:47,941 --> 00:34:50,267
I think you just did.

480
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,903
I guess I did.

481
00:34:55,784 --> 00:34:58,656
So, let me see if I've got this right.

482
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:06,292
I'm paying you a lot of money to kill somebody
and you're getting somebody else to do it?

483
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,384
Don't worry.

484
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,509
I'm gonna kill somebody.

485
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:20,724
Better call Brikowski.

486
00:35:20,816 --> 00:35:22,441
Tell him there's a new face in town.

487
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,282
- Hey.
- Nick still hasn't shown, huh?

488
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,278
- No.
- What's with you and that towel?

489
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,995
Oh... Lindsey...

490
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:10,325
- It's a very long story.
- Get dressed, and tell me about it on the way.

491
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,749
Where are we going?

492
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,793
All we know is that somebody called Nick
from the Hotel Cheval.

493
00:36:14,884 --> 00:36:16,924
<i>I spoke to a friend who works there.</i>

494
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:19,051
<i>They keep a record of every call made.</i>

495
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:23,601
<i>She can access the computer and we can
find out what room the call came from.</i>

496
00:36:23,687 --> 00:36:25,395
What is it?

497
00:36:25,481 --> 00:36:27,521
<i>- I know this guy.
- Who?</i>

498
00:36:27,608 --> 00:36:29,067
This guy.

499
00:36:30,528 --> 00:36:32,568
You know that guy?

500
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:34,649
Yeah, I met him.

501
00:36:34,742 --> 00:36:36,154
He was dead.

502
00:36:38,706 --> 00:36:40,746
You met a dead guy?

503
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:42,873
Yeah.

504
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:45,001
In a walk-in freezer.

505
00:36:48,677 --> 00:36:51,881
Bookmaker Slim Hopkins reported missing.
Police have no leads.

506
00:36:51,972 --> 00:36:53,597
Blah, blah, blah. Yada, yada...

507
00:36:53,683 --> 00:36:57,728
A spokesperson commented off the record,
"Ironic that Hopkins should go missing,

508
00:36:57,813 --> 00:37:02,642
considering he's allegedly been behind
a few disappearing acts himself."

509
00:37:05,781 --> 00:37:10,111
I think it's time you told me that story
about why you're still wearing that towel.

510
00:37:10,203 --> 00:37:12,660
- Do you mind if I get dressed first?
- (Phone rings)

511
00:37:12,749 --> 00:37:15,501
Could be my friend from the hotel. Be right back.

512
00:37:19,131 --> 00:37:20,756
Hm.

513
00:37:31,772 --> 00:37:35,224
Hey, Lindsey, I don't think it's such a good idea
that we continue to...

514
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:39,527
Put your shoes on, Schlomo wants to see you.

515
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:45,285
I don't know anyone named Schlomo.

516
00:37:46,374 --> 00:37:49,994
Someone named Schlomo knows you.
That is your only concern.

517
00:37:50,088 --> 00:37:51,499
Let's go.

518
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:53,417
Like I said, I don't know...

519
00:37:55,302 --> 00:37:57,342
Aaahh... better...

520
00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:01,059
I think it's better if you let me do the talking.

521
00:38:01,142 --> 00:38:02,638
You think?

522
00:38:08,777 --> 00:38:11,399
What is it?

523
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:14,945
He's sorry that he hit you.

524
00:38:15,036 --> 00:38:17,076
<i>- Do you always speak for him?
- Yes.</i>

525
00:38:19,249 --> 00:38:20,993
Hm.

526
00:38:21,085 --> 00:38:23,125
So, he's a mute, then.

527
00:38:23,212 --> 00:38:24,208
Not quite.

528
00:38:24,297 --> 00:38:26,337
Well, what, then?

529
00:38:26,424 --> 00:38:28,999
It's personal. You'll have to ask him.

530
00:38:29,095 --> 00:38:31,135
- Hm. How would he tell me?
- He wouldn't.

531
00:38:36,145 --> 00:38:38,138
- Hey, are we going to the...?
- No.

532
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:40,640
- But he's right there.
- A different outfit entirely.

533
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,111
<i>Right across the street from one another?</i>

534
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:48,527
At one time they were one with one another.
And then they tried to kill one another.

535
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:54,290
<i>And now neither man leaves
his respective tower of isolation</i>

536
00:38:54,377 --> 00:38:56,833
for fear of what the other man will do to him.

537
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,140
Let me guess, all the way up?

538
00:39:11,023 --> 00:39:13,062
Penthouse.

539
00:39:20,535 --> 00:39:22,575
Gentle piano music

540
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,012
You must be Mr Fisher.

541
00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:49,646
Must I? Because... that hasn't been
working out for me lately.

542
00:39:49,738 --> 00:39:52,490
- But I'm afraid you must.
- Well, if I must.

543
00:39:53,743 --> 00:39:56,200
Do you know for what reason
you've been brought here?

544
00:40:00,043 --> 00:40:01,703
For starters, I'm unlucky.

545
00:40:01,795 --> 00:40:05,793
The unlucky are nothing more than
a frame of reference for the lucky, Mr Fisher.

546
00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:08,755
You are unlucky so I may know that I am not.

547
00:40:08,846 --> 00:40:12,429
Unfortunately, the lucky never realise
they are lucky until it's too late.

548
00:40:12,517 --> 00:40:16,136
Take yourself for instance. Yesterday
you were better off than you are today,

549
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:21,606
but it took today for you to realise it. But...
today has arrived, and it's too late, you see?

550
00:40:23,114 --> 00:40:25,107
<i>People are never happy with what they have.</i>

551
00:40:26,242 --> 00:40:29,694
They always want what they had,
or what someone else has.

552
00:40:29,788 --> 00:40:32,197
Kinda like a rabbi
who would rather be a gangster,

553
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:34,285
a gangster who would rather be a rabbi.

554
00:40:34,378 --> 00:40:35,457
I mean, what is that?

555
00:40:35,546 --> 00:40:38,750
Some sort of grass is always greener
on the other side of the fence thing?

556
00:40:38,842 --> 00:40:42,128
<i>I mean, how do youjustify being a rabbi</i>

557
00:40:42,221 --> 00:40:44,380
and a gangster?

558
00:40:48,354 --> 00:40:50,098
I don't.

559
00:40:50,189 --> 00:40:53,274
I'm a bad man who doesn't waste time
wondering what could've been,

560
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,436
when I am what could've been or not have been.

561
00:40:55,529 --> 00:40:59,315
I live on both sides of the fence,
and my grass is always green.

562
00:40:59,994 --> 00:41:02,033
Consider, Mr Fisher...

563
00:41:02,747 --> 00:41:04,656
...there are two men sitting here before you,

564
00:41:04,749 --> 00:41:07,751
and one of them you should be very afraid of.
Where's my money?

565
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:11,924
- I've been hearing that a lot lately.
- My father used to say,

566
00:41:12,009 --> 00:41:14,714
"The first time somebody calls you a horse,
you punch him.

567
00:41:14,804 --> 00:41:17,556
The second time somebody calls you a horse,
call him a jerk.

568
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,936
But the third time somebody calls you a horse,
perhaps it's time to go shopping for a saddle."

569
00:41:31,616 --> 00:41:35,450
- I don't have your money.
- This isn't like skipping out on the check.

570
00:41:35,538 --> 00:41:38,955
You owe me money.
I have interests, you owe them money.

571
00:41:39,043 --> 00:41:41,961
- I don't even know how much money I owe you.
- $33,000.

572
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:44,454
- But I'm not Nick fisher.
- Then who the hell are you?

573
00:41:44,549 --> 00:41:47,836
I'm just a guy who was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

574
00:41:51,225 --> 00:41:53,265
You have 48 hours to get my money.

575
00:41:53,352 --> 00:41:56,722
Saul will keep an eye on you.
In the meantime, you may go now.

576
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,401
Wait, I just have one question.

577
00:42:06,035 --> 00:42:08,075
I wasn't frisked.

578
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,715
I see. So, being a rabbi, a... a religious man...

579
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,178
There are three things a Jew may not do
in order to save a life, including his own.

580
00:42:22,263 --> 00:42:28,268
He may not idol-worship, commit adultery,
or perform an act of premeditated murder.

581
00:42:29,022 --> 00:42:31,430
Killing you before you killed me
would have been...

582
00:42:31,525 --> 00:42:33,565
- Kosher.
- (Exhales)

583
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:37,737
Acceptable.

584
00:42:57,683 --> 00:43:00,139
I've wired half the money
to your bank in the Caymans.

585
00:43:00,228 --> 00:43:03,480
The other half will be deposited
when our old friend is in the ground.

586
00:43:03,566 --> 00:43:05,606
Now I can expect that when?

587
00:43:10,324 --> 00:43:12,447
- Very soon.
- Good.

588
00:43:12,535 --> 00:43:15,241
So, tell me. The kid...

589
00:43:16,082 --> 00:43:18,122
<i>What do you want with him?</i>

590
00:43:20,295 --> 00:43:22,537
The kid and I have unfinished business.

591
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:35,313
If there's one thing I know,
it's when someone is lying.

592
00:43:35,397 --> 00:43:37,641
A man in my position, it's all he has to go on.

593
00:43:39,194 --> 00:43:42,813
To know a lie when he hears it,
it's the difference between life and death -

594
00:43:42,907 --> 00:43:44,651
your own, someone else's.

595
00:43:44,743 --> 00:43:47,828
That being said, he wasn't lying.

596
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:50,451
That's not Nick Fisher.

597
00:43:51,627 --> 00:43:52,706
I know.

598
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:08,014
I came back here, you were gone. So,
I went to the hotel without you to see my friend.

599
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:11,060
She says the call to Nick came from Room 1009.

600
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:14,937
A fellow registered under the name of Smith,
if you can believe that.

601
00:44:15,031 --> 00:44:18,900
It's one of the most common names in the world,
so there's bound to be a couple of 'em.

602
00:44:18,994 --> 00:44:21,284
But I get the feeling that this ain't one of 'em.

603
00:44:21,372 --> 00:44:24,409
I get up to the tenth floor, and just as I do,

604
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:28,417
the door to room 1009 opens
and there's our Mr Smith. In the flesh.

605
00:44:28,507 --> 00:44:33,419
So, I pretend I'm walking to the elevator instead
of coming from it and we take it down together.

606
00:44:33,513 --> 00:44:35,636
He smiles at me - thanks - I smile back.

607
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,091
<i>But I have no idea who he is
but I thinkyou might,</i>

608
00:44:39,186 --> 00:44:42,521
<i>so I take a picture using my cellphone
which I thought was a total waste</i>

609
00:44:42,608 --> 00:44:45,146
cos the photos look like shit and I never use it.

610
00:44:45,236 --> 00:44:50,397
So there I am pretending to dial a number,
and taking Smith's picture - him none the wiser.

611
00:44:51,285 --> 00:44:53,444
This is Smith. Recognise him?

612
00:44:53,538 --> 00:44:54,320
No.

613
00:44:55,249 --> 00:44:59,958
I didn't think you would, but it was worth a shot.
Anyway, we take the elevator to the lobby,

614
00:45:00,046 --> 00:45:03,914
and the man who calls himself Smith
walks outside and hails himself a cab.

615
00:45:04,009 --> 00:45:05,837
So I followed him.

616
00:45:11,561 --> 00:45:14,681
<i>He went down
into an apartment building downtown.</i>

617
00:45:14,773 --> 00:45:16,932
<i>So I wait. An hour goes by.</i>

618
00:45:18,236 --> 00:45:21,403
And just when I'm getting ready to leave -
who walks outside?

619
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:23,317
- Smith?
- You.

620
00:45:27,914 --> 00:45:28,696
Me?

621
00:45:30,668 --> 00:45:34,797
<i>You out of the same building
with two Hasidic Jews on either side of you.</i>

622
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,709
Friends of yours?

623
00:45:38,761 --> 00:45:40,220
Not exactly.

624
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:42,548
I think it's time you told me that story.

625
00:45:44,018 --> 00:45:47,186
Well, there's this guy
and they call him The Boss, right?

626
00:45:48,274 --> 00:45:51,690
And then, right across the street
there's this man they call The Rabbi.

627
00:45:51,778 --> 00:45:54,946
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

628
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,787
So now I have to "take out",
to use the vernacular,

629
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:08,798
The Fairy, in order to scratch a debt
that isn't even mine.

630
00:46:08,883 --> 00:46:14,720
And if that's not enough, I have 48 hours to
come up with $33,000 or The Rabbi's gonna...

631
00:46:15,725 --> 00:46:17,765
I don't know who Mr Smith is.

632
00:46:18,686 --> 00:46:21,642
And the worst part about it is,
I'm not Nick Fisher.

633
00:46:22,442 --> 00:46:23,224
Ironic.

634
00:46:24,277 --> 00:46:25,986
I know, I don't even gamble.

635
00:46:26,071 --> 00:46:29,238
No, I mean the mobster having a gay son.
That's ironic.

636
00:46:32,163 --> 00:46:35,081
We are dealing with a bona fide case
of mistaken identity here.

637
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:39,034
Things like that aren't supposed to be real.
It's like amnesia.

638
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:43,424
Notwithstanding, here you are,
and Nick's nowhere to be found, so...

639
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,800
I'd say you're fucked.

640
00:46:45,888 --> 00:46:47,881
Fucked.

641
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:53,685
Shouldn't you be a little worried about this?

642
00:46:53,773 --> 00:46:56,062
I have Ataraxia.

643
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,350
Ataraxia?

644
00:46:58,487 --> 00:47:03,731
It's a condition characterised by freedom
from worry or any other preoccupation really.

645
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,405
I have to have my answer
to The Boss in the morning.

646
00:47:08,499 --> 00:47:10,540
Oh, what are you gonna say?

647
00:47:11,921 --> 00:47:14,626
What a man with two penises would say
when his tailor asks him

648
00:47:14,716 --> 00:47:17,290
- if he dresses to the right or to the left.
- What's that?

649
00:47:19,972 --> 00:47:20,886
Yes.

650
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:23,890
I knew you had sense.

651
00:47:25,521 --> 00:47:28,392
Sense is something you have
when you have a choice.

652
00:47:28,483 --> 00:47:30,310
Sometimes.

653
00:47:30,402 --> 00:47:32,858
Sometimes it's when you know you don't.

654
00:47:34,366 --> 00:47:37,949
Nah, don't move that bishop!
It's an obvious sucker bet.

655
00:47:38,746 --> 00:47:41,320
If you don't, y-y-you can have him in four moves.

656
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:43,824
If you do, he's gonna have you in mate in one.

657
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,418
He doesn't see it.

658
00:47:48,509 --> 00:47:51,179
Wouldn't matter if he did.

659
00:47:51,262 --> 00:47:52,757
Elvis lets me win.

660
00:47:53,974 --> 00:47:56,097
<i>Everybody lets me win.</i>

661
00:47:56,894 --> 00:47:59,849
Wait a minute. You know this game?

662
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,984
THE BOSS: You got three days.

663
00:48:10,786 --> 00:48:12,579
I was thinking it would take me a week.

664
00:48:12,664 --> 00:48:15,156
Oh, you were thinking that, were you?

665
00:48:15,251 --> 00:48:19,463
With all your experience killing people?
I'll tell you what.

666
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:23,627
You win this game, you got your week.

667
00:48:28,225 --> 00:48:28,890
Hm.

668
00:48:39,448 --> 00:48:42,366
THE BOSS: So, what's the plan with Yitzchok?

669
00:48:43,828 --> 00:48:45,620
Was gonna play it by ear.

670
00:48:45,705 --> 00:48:48,874
Well, if it's all the same,
I'd write it down. It's a tough tune.

671
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,497
And, by the way, he has shadows.

672
00:48:56,344 --> 00:48:58,171
Shadows?

673
00:49:02,269 --> 00:49:04,012
Bodyguards.

674
00:49:04,771 --> 00:49:06,811
With him all the time.

675
00:49:08,693 --> 00:49:10,567
Military.

676
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,700
Ex-lsraeli Mossad.

677
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:23,210
THE BOSS: They go where he goes,
round-the-clock. Ex-lsraeli Mossad.

678
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,335
Ex-lsraeli Mossad.

679
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:29,166
That doesn't sound good.

680
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:32,629
<i>They live in the apartment next door.</i>

681
00:49:33,557 --> 00:49:35,847
He wears a panic button on a chain
around his neck.

682
00:49:35,935 --> 00:49:38,060
<i>Looks like an ordinary Star of David.</i>

683
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,309
He presses that button
and, well, we all know how that ends.

684
00:49:42,402 --> 00:49:43,813
What's this?

685
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:46,103
Oh, God! No, you didn't?

686
00:49:49,202 --> 00:49:50,947
- Get down!
- (Silenced gunshot)

687
00:49:52,665 --> 00:49:54,955
<i>Response time's gonna be
three to five seconds.</i>

688
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:58,000
He's gonna have to hit him
when he least expects it.

689
00:49:58,088 --> 00:50:00,128
Where?

690
00:50:00,216 --> 00:50:03,053
- Where?
- The apartment.

691
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:08,179
How do I get in his apartment?
I can't just walk in the front door.

692
00:50:08,936 --> 00:50:11,308
No, I was thinking you'd use the back door.

693
00:50:18,865 --> 00:50:20,941
Then what?

694
00:50:21,034 --> 00:50:23,276
He does the kid, I do him.

695
00:50:24,205 --> 00:50:26,778
I plant my gun. Clean, no history.

696
00:50:26,874 --> 00:50:31,040
And Yitzchok - fire a round,
get some powder burns on the hands.

697
00:50:32,424 --> 00:50:36,125
Take the clothes off- make it look like a,

698
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:40,931
"You do me, I do you, we're both gay, the
world doesn't understand us," double suicide.

699
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:44,097
And that's all there is to it.

700
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:47,390
Is that all there is to it?

701
00:50:47,484 --> 00:50:49,976
Yeah. It's all there is to it.

702
00:50:58,748 --> 00:50:59,863
Peww!

703
00:51:02,878 --> 00:51:05,003
I'm not such a bad guy, you know.

704
00:51:06,717 --> 00:51:08,959
<i>Some folks have grown pretty fat off me.</i>

705
00:51:11,723 --> 00:51:13,763
Some have grown pretty dead.

706
00:51:18,357 --> 00:51:19,816
You're a conundrum, you.

707
00:51:22,153 --> 00:51:26,780
You walk in here shooting your fucking mouth off
like you don't give a fuck if it gets shot off.

708
00:51:28,077 --> 00:51:29,488
You can only kill me once.

709
00:51:37,505 --> 00:51:38,288
Checkmate.

710
00:51:44,807 --> 00:51:46,847
Nobody says I have to kill you quick.

711
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:52,057
Cat.

712
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,978
Mouse.

713
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,695
You've got three days.

714
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,702
Excuse me.

715
00:52:25,524 --> 00:52:27,149
Who the fuck is this guy?

716
00:52:28,153 --> 00:52:31,605
<i>Dunno. But whoever he is, he's either in
very deep shit or I don't know what,</i>

717
00:52:31,699 --> 00:52:36,576
because he's playing in the sandbox with
the Darkies, the Skullcaps and who knows who.

718
00:52:36,664 --> 00:52:40,709
Call Murph and see if he got a match
on that photo Marty snapped.

719
00:52:40,794 --> 00:52:42,870
Yes, boss.

720
00:52:42,963 --> 00:52:46,380
I want a complete rundown on this fucker.
Everything from A to Z.

721
00:52:46,468 --> 00:52:49,469
Who he is. Who does he know?
The people he knows, who do they know?

722
00:52:49,555 --> 00:52:53,055
I want to know
what the fuck he is doing in my fucking city.

723
00:53:03,197 --> 00:53:04,691
- What have you got?
- Get this.

724
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:07,274
The Kat's in town.

725
00:53:07,369 --> 00:53:08,567
Goodkat?

726
00:53:08,662 --> 00:53:11,333
- It's the song junkies are singing.
- What's the happenstance?

727
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:14,714
Didn't know the happenstance.
Just said the word was the Kat's in town.

728
00:53:14,727 --> 00:53:17,052
Um... who's er... who's Goodkat?

729
00:53:17,146 --> 00:53:19,684
<i>Real heavy hitter.</i>

730
00:53:19,773 --> 00:53:22,810
- The heaviest.
- He shows, people die, he vanishes.

731
00:53:22,902 --> 00:53:25,440
No-one knows who he is, or what he looks like.

732
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:28,530
And he hasn't worked New York
in, like, two decades.

733
00:53:28,616 --> 00:53:30,655
<i>Just what we need.</i>

734
00:53:30,743 --> 00:53:31,905
All right.

735
00:53:32,703 --> 00:53:37,864
And get some different fucking coffee in here,
will you? I gotta get to the fucking morgue.

736
00:53:45,883 --> 00:53:48,968
- Hey! I figured it out.
- Hey. What did you figure out?

737
00:53:49,053 --> 00:53:51,591
You said that Slim Hopkins worked
for The Boss, right?

738
00:53:51,681 --> 00:53:53,472
Well, listen.

739
00:53:53,557 --> 00:53:55,466
The Rabbi also had a bookie - Benny Begin.

740
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:58,346
Benny's at the morgue.
Somebody killed him and his goons.

741
00:53:58,437 --> 00:54:00,679
- The morgue?
- Didn't I say I was a coroner?

742
00:54:00,773 --> 00:54:02,517
No, you didn't say you were a coroner.

743
00:54:05,569 --> 00:54:07,609
Benny Begin - killed by a baseball.

744
00:54:08,364 --> 00:54:10,155
My guess was a fastball.

745
00:54:12,035 --> 00:54:15,284
Well, either way it proves
that the good Lord has a sense of humour.

746
00:54:15,371 --> 00:54:17,162
- Good morning, Detective.
- Morning.

747
00:54:17,248 --> 00:54:20,498
- You know this guy?
- Big-time bookie. Worked for The Rabbi.

748
00:54:20,584 --> 00:54:23,539
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

749
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:25,539
Between you and me...

750
00:54:26,424 --> 00:54:30,207
20 years ago he used to be my bookie.
I used to sign my pay cheques over to him.

751
00:54:31,595 --> 00:54:34,264
What about the other two?
Did you get anything on them yet?

752
00:54:34,348 --> 00:54:36,306
These two were poisoned.

753
00:54:36,392 --> 00:54:38,848
Something exotic.

754
00:54:38,936 --> 00:54:41,308
- I'm running it down.
- Well, let me know.

755
00:54:41,397 --> 00:54:43,224
<i>Will do.</i>

756
00:54:43,983 --> 00:54:44,765
Prick.

757
00:54:48,738 --> 00:54:51,608
- Have a good day.
- You too, Detective.

758
00:54:56,328 --> 00:54:58,285
Jimmy, I'm taking my lunch break.

759
00:55:00,165 --> 00:55:03,617
Don't you see?
Nick isn't missing, he's hiding. He set you up.

760
00:55:03,711 --> 00:55:05,538
- Nick set me up?
- Like a bowling pin.

761
00:55:05,629 --> 00:55:08,203
Nick found himself in a jam.
He got you to take his place.

762
00:55:08,299 --> 00:55:11,963
He paid a street thug to mug you,
but all he wants is your wallet and licence

763
00:55:12,052 --> 00:55:13,880
<i>so he ignores the watch and suitcase.</i>

764
00:55:13,971 --> 00:55:15,798
<i>Then Nick kills Slim Hopkins and Benny,</i>

765
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:19,472
the only guys who know what he looks like,
and now you're left holding the bag!

766
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,260
- But I called Nick. I initiated contact.
- Well, maybe it just seems that way.

767
00:55:23,355 --> 00:55:26,143
- What about Smith?
- I still can't figure him out in all this.

768
00:55:26,234 --> 00:55:27,609
Hm.

769
00:55:27,693 --> 00:55:30,101
- You should run.
- I can't.

770
00:55:30,196 --> 00:55:32,983
- They'll kill you if you stay.
- They'll kill me if I leave.

771
00:55:33,073 --> 00:55:36,074
- Go to the police!
- These guys buy cops like cops buy doughnuts.

772
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:38,200
This isn't the first time this has happened.

773
00:55:38,287 --> 00:55:41,786
This isn't the first time a crime lord asked you
to kill the gay son of a rival

774
00:55:41,874 --> 00:55:45,574
to pay off a friend's debt whose place you're
staying in because you lost your job

775
00:55:45,669 --> 00:55:47,662
and found your girlfriend with another guy?

776
00:55:47,754 --> 00:55:52,631
It is the first time it happened. But Nick has been
painting me into a corner since we were kids.

777
00:55:52,718 --> 00:55:55,007
I guess I've always been a better friend to him...

778
00:55:55,095 --> 00:55:59,009
Yeah, I'd love to hear the rest of this
but I've really gotta go back to work.

779
00:55:59,808 --> 00:56:03,344
- Oh, hey. Hey.
- Hey.

780
00:56:03,437 --> 00:56:08,146
I was just thinking that if you're still alive
when I get back from work tonight, maybe...

781
00:56:08,234 --> 00:56:11,898
I don't know,
we could go to dinner or something?

782
00:56:15,867 --> 00:56:17,361
Yeah, that would be great, yeah.

783
00:56:17,451 --> 00:56:19,491
- Really?
- Yeah.

784
00:56:19,578 --> 00:56:21,120
- (Chuckles)
- Yeah.

785
00:56:21,205 --> 00:56:24,241
OK. Um... No. Bye.

786
00:56:29,672 --> 00:56:31,499
Hm...

787
00:56:32,883 --> 00:56:34,163
Weird.

788
00:56:44,311 --> 00:56:45,853
What?

789
00:56:45,938 --> 00:56:50,149
I was just thinking about what it would be like
if we'd met under different circumstances.

790
00:56:50,233 --> 00:56:54,314
See, I think people should only fall in love
if there's a great story behind how they met.

791
00:56:55,197 --> 00:56:58,151
You know, seeing as you have to tell it
over and over again.

792
00:56:59,243 --> 00:57:02,825
If you and I fell in love,
we'd have one hell of a story to tell.

793
00:57:02,913 --> 00:57:06,117
We'd be at a dinner party and someone
would ask, "How'd you two meet?"

794
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:11,547
And I'd say, "You tell the story, dear."
And you'd say, "No, you tell it better."

795
00:57:15,092 --> 00:57:16,372
So, come here often?

796
00:57:18,846 --> 00:57:22,297
No. But I heard about someone who does.

797
00:57:24,685 --> 00:57:26,594
- You mean... The Fairy?
- Yeah.

798
00:57:26,686 --> 00:57:28,726
- Is he...?
- Yeah.

799
00:57:29,522 --> 00:57:30,305
Where?

800
00:57:36,947 --> 00:57:38,690
This is absurd. What are you thinking?

801
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,991
- I'm thinking of a new option.
- What?

802
00:57:42,077 --> 00:57:43,987
- Talking with him.
- Talking with him?

803
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:44,779
Talking.

804
00:57:44,872 --> 00:57:49,000
You're gonna go over and say, "I'm Slevin,
some bad dudes think I am someone I am not.

805
00:57:49,084 --> 00:57:52,001
And I'm gonna have to take you out
or they're gonna take me out

806
00:57:52,087 --> 00:57:54,328
and I was wondering,
you wanna talk about it?"

807
00:57:54,422 --> 00:57:56,546
- I can't do that.
- You think?

808
00:57:56,634 --> 00:57:59,255
Look, I can't just walk over there.
He's got bodyguards.

809
00:57:59,344 --> 00:58:02,179
Aside from that, you're pretty much dead-on.

810
00:58:02,264 --> 00:58:06,131
- Bodyguards?
- Yeah. Right behind him. Two of them. Israelis.

811
00:58:06,893 --> 00:58:08,803
Beards. Right behind him.

812
00:58:09,772 --> 00:58:11,811
<i>See 'em?</i>

813
00:58:14,609 --> 00:58:16,732
- You're getting good at this.
- Thanks.

814
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,611
How are you gonna have a talk with him?

815
00:58:18,697 --> 00:58:21,070
When he goes to the bathroom,
I'll follow him in.

816
00:58:21,951 --> 00:58:23,990
What do you think?

817
00:58:24,912 --> 00:58:27,153
<i>Could someone tell me why I'm in the van?</i>

818
00:58:28,665 --> 00:58:30,871
<i>Because I could only get a reservation for two.</i>

819
00:58:32,211 --> 00:58:34,998
<i>All right, The Fairy's at a table in the middle.</i>

820
00:58:35,089 --> 00:58:36,499
<i>Bodyguards nearb y.</i>

821
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:40,634
<i>Our boy's not far away
but I can't make out who's with him.</i>

822
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:44,420
<i>- Did Murph get a beat on him yet?
- Murph says, whoever he is, he's a ghost.</i>

823
00:58:44,515 --> 00:58:48,180
<i>Can't find anyone who's ever even
bumped into him, much less tripped over him.</i>

824
00:58:53,106 --> 00:58:55,348
<i>The Fairy's going to the bathroom.</i>

825
00:58:59,113 --> 00:59:01,520
<i>And our boy's making a move. Shit.</i>

826
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,627
<i>- Marty, the door's locked.
- Relax.</i>

827
00:59:25,722 --> 00:59:28,474
It's not gonna go down in the men's room.

828
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,561
I got it next.

829
00:59:37,442 --> 00:59:39,601
- What went down in the men's room?
- We talked.

830
00:59:39,695 --> 00:59:40,476
And?

831
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:42,646
I told him I thought we should get together.

832
00:59:42,739 --> 00:59:44,150
- You didn't?
- I did.

833
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,149
And?

834
00:59:46,242 --> 00:59:49,197
- I got a date.
- Do you think this is safe?

835
00:59:49,288 --> 00:59:53,332
It can't be any worse than what's waiting for me
behind door number two.

836
00:59:54,542 --> 00:59:56,831
It's gonna be tough. I think I picked up a pigtail.

837
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,127
- A what?
- The cops.

838
00:59:59,214 --> 01:00:02,500
Oh, a pig tail. Cute.

839
01:00:04,428 --> 01:00:06,835
I ran into a nosy cop in the men's room.

840
01:00:16,106 --> 01:00:18,145
You and me need to talk.

841
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:24,440
- Do I know you?
- No, but I know you.

842
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,156
Listen, I'm sorry, no offence, but I'm not...

843
01:00:34,249 --> 01:00:35,956
I'm not gay.

844
01:00:36,042 --> 01:00:40,206
- I'm a cop.
- Well, I'm not a robber if you catch my drift?

845
01:00:41,214 --> 01:00:43,041
I've been watching you.

846
01:00:43,133 --> 01:00:47,925
I know what you're into.
Who are you? I mean, I know who you're not.

847
01:00:48,012 --> 01:00:50,765
You're not Nick Fisher.
The guy whose apartment you're in.

848
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:53,601
I know because Nick
spent eight years in Dade Correctional

849
01:00:53,685 --> 01:00:56,639
for forcing himself on a 14-year-old cheerleader.

850
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:58,769
Dade County sent me a picture of Nick Fisher.

851
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:00,813
And you... are not him.

852
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:04,317
So... who the fuck are you?

853
01:01:08,491 --> 01:01:10,947
I'm just a guy whose dinner's getting cold.

854
01:01:12,203 --> 01:01:14,113
May I leave now?

855
01:01:14,206 --> 01:01:15,949
- Come here.
- What?

856
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:21,201
Dead bodies in refrigerators. Cops in men's
rooms. You remind me of... James Bond.

857
01:01:25,675 --> 01:01:28,131
That is the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

858
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:30,177
And The Boss, he could be Kananga.

859
01:01:30,263 --> 01:01:31,045
Kananga?

860
01:01:32,724 --> 01:01:35,096
- No, The Boss is no Kananga.
- Well, who's The Boss?

861
01:01:35,184 --> 01:01:37,224
Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

862
01:01:38,146 --> 01:01:41,729
Which one? Donald Pleasance?
Telly Savalas? Max von Sydow?

863
01:01:42,651 --> 01:01:46,185
You know your Bond.
But alas, I was referring to Anthony Dawson.

864
01:01:46,279 --> 01:01:47,903
Who?

865
01:01:47,989 --> 01:01:50,694
Well, he played Blofeld
in From Russia With Love.

866
01:01:50,784 --> 01:01:54,235
Well, you never see Blofeld's face
in From Russia With Love.

867
01:01:54,329 --> 01:01:58,706
And that's when the villain is most effective,
when you don't know what he looks like.

868
01:02:16,393 --> 01:02:18,432
So...

869
01:02:21,189 --> 01:02:23,228
See you later.

870
01:02:50,093 --> 01:02:53,178
SLEVIN: Ah, that was incredible!
- (Giggles) You...

871
01:02:56,516 --> 01:02:59,600
- I just realised something.
- What's that?

872
01:02:59,686 --> 01:03:02,805
- I just made love to you.
- You're just realising that now?

873
01:03:02,897 --> 01:03:07,441
And I have no idea who specifically you were
referring to when you said James Bond.

874
01:03:07,527 --> 01:03:11,821
Because earlier when you were telling me
that I reminded you of James Bond,

875
01:03:11,906 --> 01:03:16,069
and I was saying that it was the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me,

876
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,239
I naturally assumed...

877
01:03:17,328 --> 01:03:20,532
You naturally assumed
you knew who I was talking about.

878
01:03:26,045 --> 01:03:30,708
Because if you don't - if you weren't talking
about the guy I think that you're talking about,

879
01:03:30,801 --> 01:03:35,758
well, you have me mistaken for somebody else,
because in my mind there is only one Bond.

880
01:03:36,723 --> 01:03:39,048
Well, on that we agree.

881
01:03:41,394 --> 01:03:42,723
Same time on three.

882
01:03:42,813 --> 01:03:44,520
- One...
- Two...

883
01:03:44,606 --> 01:03:46,433
- Three. George Lazenby.
- Roger Moore.

884
01:03:46,524 --> 01:03:48,896
- George Lazenby?
- Roger Moore? I was kidding.

885
01:03:48,985 --> 01:03:50,527
- Yeah, I was kidding.
- You were?

886
01:03:50,611 --> 01:03:52,651
The only James Bond is...

887
01:03:52,738 --> 01:03:54,862
- Timothy Dalton.
- Pierce Brosnan.

888
01:03:58,119 --> 01:04:00,408
- Scotland forever.
- I feel so much better.

889
01:04:33,613 --> 01:04:35,653
Why are you going?

890
01:04:36,366 --> 01:04:38,405
I'm just going to get us some coffee.

891
01:04:39,452 --> 01:04:41,279
OK.

892
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:46,747
Hurry back to me.

893
01:04:47,544 --> 01:04:48,954
WENDY RENE: After Laughter

894
01:04:49,045 --> 01:04:56,292
When you're in love, you're happy

895
01:04:56,886 --> 01:05:01,133
Oh, and when you're in her arms

896
01:05:01,224 --> 01:05:06,466
You gain

897
01:05:08,355 --> 01:05:10,894
After...

898
01:05:10,984 --> 01:05:13,023
Hey! Police.

899
01:05:13,111 --> 01:05:15,150
Aw, come on, man.

900
01:05:15,238 --> 01:05:17,811
I already talked to your buddy.

901
01:05:18,657 --> 01:05:22,608
After...
After your laughter

902
01:05:26,457 --> 01:05:28,913
Good morning. I'm Detective Dumbrowski.

903
01:05:29,001 --> 01:05:31,243
Good morning, Detective.
Am I being kidnapped?

904
01:05:31,337 --> 01:05:34,457
Nope. We just want to have
a quick, friendly word with you.

905
01:05:34,549 --> 01:05:38,214
Is this standard operating procedure
you'd find in the policeman's manual

906
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,880
if you look up "quick, friendly word"?

907
01:05:39,971 --> 01:05:42,675
There is no SOP for the box
you got yourself into.

908
01:05:42,765 --> 01:05:44,176
Oh.

909
01:05:48,563 --> 01:05:51,564
- So what do you want to talk to me about?
- You.

910
01:05:51,649 --> 01:05:53,855
- What about me?
- Who are you?

911
01:05:53,943 --> 01:05:55,520
- Philosophically speaking?
- Name.

912
01:05:55,611 --> 01:05:58,184
- Rank, serial number...
- You should really play ball.

913
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,321
You think I'm tall enough?

914
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:14,500
- What is your name?
- Oh, yeah, I remember. Slevin Kelevra.

915
01:06:14,589 --> 01:06:16,914
K-E-L-E-V-R-A.

916
01:06:17,008 --> 01:06:19,843
<i>- Kelevra.
- Look, kid,</i>

917
01:06:19,927 --> 01:06:23,047
I don't know what's going on,
or how you're into this,

918
01:06:23,138 --> 01:06:25,713
but when I figure out what there is to figure out,

919
01:06:25,808 --> 01:06:27,717
I'm not gonna be so nice to you.

920
01:06:28,561 --> 01:06:30,886
Oh, this is nice. Don't do me any favours.

921
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:34,270
<i>Last chance to come clean.</i>

922
01:06:41,115 --> 01:06:43,155
Take a walk.

923
01:06:44,368 --> 01:06:47,285
I think this is the part
where you tell me not to walk too far.

924
01:07:35,711 --> 01:07:39,045
When you're in love

925
01:07:39,132 --> 01:07:43,176
You're happy

926
01:07:43,803 --> 01:07:47,882
Oh, and when you're in her arms

927
01:07:47,973 --> 01:07:52,968
You gain

928
01:07:55,189 --> 01:08:00,266
After
This doesn't matter...

929
01:08:00,361 --> 01:08:01,771
I have to go to work.

930
01:08:02,863 --> 01:08:04,903
Hey.

931
01:08:05,533 --> 01:08:07,572
After
After...

932
01:08:31,851 --> 01:08:34,935
- Hey, guys, what are you doing here?
- Now's the time.

933
01:08:35,938 --> 01:08:38,393
I've got at least... Jesus.

934
01:08:38,482 --> 01:08:41,898
The Boss says he wants you to look nice
for The Fairy.

935
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:02,224
You're early.

936
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:09,233
Why don't you come in and fix yourself a drink?
I was just getting ready.

937
01:10:21,168 --> 01:10:22,912
<i>You'll have to excuse the...</i>

938
01:10:23,003 --> 01:10:24,830
I wasn't expecting you for...

939
01:10:27,883 --> 01:10:29,710
<i>You look good.</i>

940
01:10:30,552 --> 01:10:32,960
<i>- You want some wine?
- No.</i>

941
01:10:33,055 --> 01:10:35,095
Is something the matter?

942
01:10:38,894 --> 01:10:40,518
Somebody's trying to kill you.

943
01:10:42,564 --> 01:10:44,391
Who?

944
01:10:47,444 --> 01:10:48,476
Me.

945
01:11:42,332 --> 01:11:44,788
- That was close.
- Yeah.

946
01:13:03,539 --> 01:13:04,618
Close.

947
01:14:28,206 --> 01:14:30,246
<i>THE BOSS: I hired you to do ajob.</i>

948
01:14:31,835 --> 01:14:33,958
It wasn't supposed to look like a job.

949
01:14:35,964 --> 01:14:41,172
So you take out the Israelis,
bomb the damn building...

950
01:14:43,013 --> 01:14:46,429
and now the job
that was not supposed to look like a job's

951
01:14:46,516 --> 01:14:48,841
beginning to look very much

952
01:14:48,935 --> 01:14:50,974
like a job.

953
01:14:59,946 --> 01:15:01,985
All right. Fuck it.

954
01:15:04,617 --> 01:15:06,657
If the Rabbi wants a war...

955
01:15:07,579 --> 01:15:10,152
...l'll give him a war.

956
01:15:17,463 --> 01:15:19,291
Saul.

957
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:24,501
- Saul.

958
01:15:24,971 --> 01:15:27,260
<i>Saul, the phone's been...</i>

959
01:15:27,348 --> 01:15:29,388
Oh.

960
01:15:29,475 --> 01:15:31,516
I thought you were Saul.

961
01:15:34,231 --> 01:15:36,556
People have been thinking I'm somebody else.

962
01:15:40,153 --> 01:15:42,690
Your predicament reminds me of a story.

963
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:45,236
Hitchcock. North By Northwest.

964
01:15:46,117 --> 01:15:50,031
The movie where everybody thinks Cary Grant
is a man named George Kaplan,

965
01:15:50,121 --> 01:15:53,241
but the thing is there is no George Kaplan.
It's just a made-up name.

966
01:15:53,332 --> 01:15:55,789
But names, even made-up ones...

967
01:15:58,338 --> 01:16:00,663
...can bring about quite a bit of trouble.

968
01:16:02,675 --> 01:16:04,134
Now...

969
01:16:04,218 --> 01:16:06,460
the woman in the picture with Grant,

970
01:16:06,554 --> 01:16:09,010
<i>- her name was er...
- Eva Marie Saint.</i>

971
01:16:09,099 --> 01:16:11,969
- Oh... you know this movie.
- I know this movie.

972
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:15,263
I took my father to see it in 1959.
His English wasn't very good,

973
01:16:15,355 --> 01:16:18,308
but boy, did he like Miss Saint.

974
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:21,317
After the movie he turned to me and he said,
"She's a real Buick."

975
01:16:21,403 --> 01:16:24,937
You see, he couldn't pronounce
the word beauty, so he'd say Buick.

976
01:16:26,282 --> 01:16:30,196
- Caused quite a bit of confusion.
- Using the wrong name'll do that.

977
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:36,492
Is that my money?

978
01:16:36,584 --> 01:16:37,995
This is everything I owe you.

979
01:17:12,662 --> 01:17:16,612
It's the Sabbath. You see,
we don't answer the phone on the Sabbath.

980
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:18,581
I know.

981
01:17:18,668 --> 01:17:20,541
Normally Saul turns off the ringer.

982
01:17:20,628 --> 01:17:21,826
Saul!

983
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:24,591
I tell you, you can't find good help these days.

984
01:17:28,594 --> 01:17:30,883
Saul's dead.

985
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:34,964
<i>They're all dead.</i>

986
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:01,499
Oh, I've been in this room before.

987
01:18:04,047 --> 01:18:06,086
Looks the same as it did 20 years ago.

988
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:09,422
Somehow...

989
01:18:10,302 --> 01:18:11,713
Somehow it seems different.

990
01:18:11,804 --> 01:18:15,588
The way your car seems different
when someone else is driving it.

991
01:18:16,893 --> 01:18:20,059
Then again, it's been 20 years
since I've been in a car.

992
01:18:21,355 --> 01:18:24,523
Two decades spent behind three inches
of bulletproof glass

993
01:18:24,609 --> 01:18:29,401
due to a natural fear of high-powered rifles
and quiet... rooftops in New Jersey.

994
01:18:29,489 --> 01:18:31,528
20 years...

995
01:18:33,534 --> 01:18:36,951
...locked away in my own paranoia,
a prisoner in my own home.

996
01:18:39,457 --> 01:18:42,328
Only to be delivered to fate by a boy.

997
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:50,418
<i>Well, Anthony, it looks as though you've won,
if such a term may be applied.</i>

998
01:18:52,845 --> 01:18:55,217
<i>If I were wearing a hat, I would take it off.</i>

999
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:00,934
Should we get on with it, then?

1000
01:19:07,485 --> 01:19:09,524
You can keep your hat on, Schlomo.

1001
01:19:14,701 --> 01:19:18,116
Looks like we were sold a bill of goods
by the same salesman.

1002
01:19:20,706 --> 01:19:22,746
Nice speech, though.

1003
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:28,954
I wish I was standing for it.

1004
01:19:40,018 --> 01:19:42,259
You... you brought this upon our heads.

1005
01:19:44,647 --> 01:19:48,775
- Me?
- You... you hired Goodkat to kill my son.

1006
01:19:50,736 --> 01:19:52,776
After you murdered my son?

1007
01:19:54,574 --> 01:19:57,444
- I had no hand in that.
- Oh, sure.

1008
01:19:57,535 --> 01:19:59,574
Just like in '84?

1009
01:20:00,121 --> 01:20:03,704
I suppose you had no hand in that either.
Just a finger, maybe?

1010
01:20:06,461 --> 01:20:08,500
Time's up, Rabbi.

1011
01:20:10,131 --> 01:20:13,084
Lying to a dead man's
the same as lying to yourself.

1012
01:20:17,096 --> 01:20:19,136
You were getting too big.

1013
01:20:21,017 --> 01:20:23,056
See...

1014
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:26,476
...problem when two men are standing in a room

1015
01:20:26,563 --> 01:20:29,482
is you can only look at one of them
and they were looking at you

1016
01:20:29,567 --> 01:20:33,066
with their backs turned,
their shirt collars smiling at me.

1017
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:37,150
Then they called you The Boss.

1018
01:20:40,244 --> 01:20:42,284
It was clear what had to be done.

1019
01:20:48,794 --> 01:20:51,629
Try and appreciate how it feels, Schlomo...

1020
01:20:54,133 --> 01:20:58,047
...to wake up in the middle of the night
with six bullets burning in your stomach.

1021
01:20:58,929 --> 01:21:01,255
Lying in a pool of your own blood and shit.

1022
01:21:05,644 --> 01:21:07,684
The dead eyes of...

1023
01:21:11,150 --> 01:21:13,771
...of your wife... staring back at you.

1024
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:19,613
The only thing keeping you from passing out

1025
01:21:19,701 --> 01:21:22,785
is the sound of the footsteps of the man
going down the hall...

1026
01:21:24,205 --> 01:21:26,244
...looking for your son.

1027
01:21:31,462 --> 01:21:33,502
I managed to save my son, Schlomo.

1028
01:21:35,216 --> 01:21:37,255
And now...

1029
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:40,550
...after all these years...

1030
01:21:42,472 --> 01:21:44,015
...in spite of our agreement!

1031
01:21:45,309 --> 01:21:46,934
You... you...

1032
01:21:47,019 --> 01:21:50,020
fucking backstabbing Philistine.

1033
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:53,098
You managed to take my son away from me.

1034
01:21:54,651 --> 01:21:56,692
Well...

1035
01:21:57,947 --> 01:22:00,070
...now I've taken your son away from you.

1036
01:22:00,157 --> 01:22:03,193
I told you I had nothing to do with...

1037
01:22:12,378 --> 01:22:14,287
You haven't heard.

1038
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:16,419
Will I?

1039
01:22:17,007 --> 01:22:20,708
Look at my face, Schlomo. Look at my smile.

1040
01:22:22,638 --> 01:22:24,346
Your son is dead.

1041
01:22:27,726 --> 01:22:29,884
Your son is dead.

1042
01:22:32,564 --> 01:22:35,186
I'm gonna kill you. Hm.

1043
01:22:37,528 --> 01:22:38,642
<i>SLEVIN: Rabbi.</i>

1044
01:22:39,947 --> 01:22:42,023
<i>Are you familiar with the Shmoo?</i>

1045
01:22:54,378 --> 01:22:56,417
Fisher.

1046
01:22:58,299 --> 01:23:00,338
Fisher, listen to me.

1047
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:05,752
I already told you,

1048
01:23:05,848 --> 01:23:07,887
I'm not Nick Fisher.

1049
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:15,270
Then who is Nick Fisher?

1050
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:23,738
I think you mean, who was Nick Fisher?

1051
01:23:25,409 --> 01:23:27,283
Fisher was the answer to a question.

1052
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:30,121
How do you get to two men
that can't be gotten to?

1053
01:23:38,088 --> 01:23:40,128
<i>You get them to come to you.</i>

1054
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:50,678
<i>But to do that... I needed a name.</i>

1055
01:23:51,518 --> 01:23:53,677
<i>And where do you find names?</i>

1056
01:23:53,771 --> 01:23:55,846
<i>In books.</i>

1057
01:24:00,236 --> 01:24:01,813
<i>And who has books?</i>

1058
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:11,951
<i>Well, your bookies have books.</i>

1059
01:24:13,791 --> 01:24:14,953
He's clean.

1060
01:24:15,042 --> 01:24:17,081
<i>SLEVIN: Crooked bookies...</i>

1061
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,004
<i>- ... who work with big-time crooks.
- So... why are you here?</i>

1062
01:24:32,684 --> 01:24:34,428
<i>I was looking for a gambler.</i>

1063
01:24:36,062 --> 01:24:37,807
<i>One who was in both books...</i>

1064
01:24:38,566 --> 01:24:40,938
<i>... with a lot of red in the minus column.</i>

1065
01:24:41,026 --> 01:24:42,189
Got him.

1066
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:44,317
<i>And that's when I found Nick Fisher.</i>

1067
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:47,069
<i>A lowlife that no-one was gonna miss.</i>

1068
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:50,160
1729.

1069
01:24:50,244 --> 01:24:52,486
Nick Fisher.

1070
01:24:52,579 --> 01:24:54,619
OK.

1071
01:25:06,343 --> 01:25:08,382
<i>GOODKAT: There was a time.</i>

1072
01:25:25,111 --> 01:25:27,733
All that was left to do was make the phone ring.

1073
01:25:48,301 --> 01:25:52,051
<i>All I had to do was pull the trigger
and wait for you to call the man</i>

1074
01:25:52,139 --> 01:25:54,464
<i>who does thejobs that no-one else wants.</i>

1075
01:25:56,602 --> 01:25:58,641
<i>THE BOSS: I want an outsider brought in.</i>

1076
01:26:00,105 --> 01:26:02,311
There's a specialist.

1077
01:26:04,526 --> 01:26:06,602
Calls himself Mr Goodkat.

1078
01:26:12,659 --> 01:26:14,698
Fine.

1079
01:26:16,413 --> 01:26:18,655
Tell him he can expect me in the morning.

1080
01:26:23,336 --> 01:26:25,376
Are you ready?

1081
01:26:25,463 --> 01:26:27,503
Yeah.

1082
01:26:30,594 --> 01:26:32,633
It's just that one last thing.

1083
01:26:41,605 --> 01:26:43,016
<i>THE BOSS: Mr Goodkat.</i>

1084
01:26:44,024 --> 01:26:45,732
It's been a long time.

1085
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:54,734
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr Goodkat.
So I'll get right down to business.

1086
01:26:55,869 --> 01:26:59,736
Slim Hopkins, the man who ran my book,
was hit yesterday.

1087
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:03,699
And I guess you've already heard about...

1088
01:27:05,211 --> 01:27:07,833
<i>- ... my son.
- Yes, I heard.</i>

1089
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,667
I need you to sort it out for me.

1090
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:12,467
Who's the mark?

1091
01:27:12,552 --> 01:27:14,130
Yitzchok.

1092
01:27:17,515 --> 01:27:19,141
Yitzchok, The Rabbi's son?

1093
01:27:19,226 --> 01:27:21,432
<i>You remember The Rabbi?</i>

1094
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,346
I remember The Rabbi well.

1095
01:27:23,438 --> 01:27:25,063
<i>Thing is...</i>

1096
01:27:25,148 --> 01:27:27,686
it can't look like a job.

1097
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:31,148
<i>If Yitzchok gets hit, The Rabbi will go to war.</i>

1098
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:38,153
So... I need you to make it look like
it ain't what it is.

1099
01:27:39,704 --> 01:27:41,910
<i>Can that be done?</i>

1100
01:27:41,998 --> 01:27:43,991
Anything can be done.

1101
01:27:46,253 --> 01:27:48,625
Good. How?

1102
01:27:48,713 --> 01:27:50,872
Kansas City Shuffle.

1103
01:27:52,675 --> 01:27:54,632
I'm not familiar with the term.

1104
01:27:57,431 --> 01:27:59,589
I'll need to see Slim's books.

1105
01:27:59,683 --> 01:28:05,269
Slim's books were taken when he was hit,
but... I do keep copies.

1106
01:28:10,027 --> 01:28:12,233
What are you looking for?

1107
01:28:15,699 --> 01:28:18,368
This is our guy. Nick - 1729.

1108
01:28:19,035 --> 01:28:21,159
1729.

1109
01:28:21,246 --> 01:28:22,657
Nick Fisher.

1110
01:28:22,748 --> 01:28:23,862
Why him?

1111
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,660
A loser.

1112
01:28:26,751 --> 01:28:29,040
Pick him up. Bring him here.

1113
01:28:37,596 --> 01:28:39,968
<i>GOODKAT: Still not talking to each other, huh?</i>

1114
01:28:40,056 --> 01:28:42,096
<i>Can't say that I blame you.</i>

1115
01:28:42,183 --> 01:28:44,341
- Why are you here?
- Big job.

1116
01:28:44,435 --> 01:28:47,520
I was under the impression
you no longer worked New York.

1117
01:28:47,606 --> 01:28:50,772
Like I said... very big job.

1118
01:28:50,859 --> 01:28:55,070
And you thought, as long as you're in town,
you'd drop by and see your old pal Schlomo,

1119
01:28:55,154 --> 01:28:57,942
and say, "Hello. How about them Yanks?"

1120
01:29:00,327 --> 01:29:02,366
No. But something like that.

1121
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:09,495
Only problem is you and I aren't old friends.

1122
01:29:09,585 --> 01:29:11,080
And I hate baseball.

1123
01:29:11,171 --> 01:29:14,456
And since we're not friends and
you hate baseball, why the fuck are you here?

1124
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:17,420
It's because we're not friends that I'm here.

1125
01:29:18,344 --> 01:29:22,093
Because if we had been friends,
I wouldn't have been hired to kill your son.

1126
01:29:22,181 --> 01:29:26,927
Because that is right at the top of my list
of things that friends do not do to their friends.

1127
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:30,270
The good news for you is,
my friendship is for sale.

1128
01:29:31,065 --> 01:29:34,434
You see, it seems to me
that your son means more to you alive

1129
01:29:34,527 --> 01:29:36,520
than he does to The Boss dead.

1130
01:29:36,613 --> 01:29:38,855
And more money means more to me
than less money.

1131
01:29:38,949 --> 01:29:43,076
And you are the guy that sleeps with
all that green under your mattress.

1132
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:45,489
I'm listening.

1133
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:49,660
You will pay me double to kill The Boss
what The Boss was paying me to kill Yitzchok.

1134
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:52,954
- Ohh.
- And that...

1135
01:29:54,756 --> 01:29:56,795
And that will make us friends.

1136
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:59,631
Right, Rabbi?

1137
01:30:00,721 --> 01:30:02,096
Hm?

1138
01:30:06,226 --> 01:30:10,971
And... since friends do favours for their friends,
you will do a favour for me.

1139
01:30:11,063 --> 01:30:13,982
Pray tell? What is this favour?

1140
01:30:14,067 --> 01:30:17,602
Concerns a matter of debt collection.
One debt in particular.

1141
01:30:17,695 --> 01:30:18,858
Whose?

1142
01:30:18,947 --> 01:30:22,066
A flop. From Benny's book.
Goes by the name of Nick Fisher.

1143
01:30:22,158 --> 01:30:24,316
Who is he?

1144
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:26,450
Just a loser.

1145
01:30:26,538 --> 01:30:28,577
You just made a lot of money.

1146
01:30:32,043 --> 01:30:35,246
<i>SLEVIN: And then I was free
to come and go as I pleased.</i>

1147
01:30:49,185 --> 01:30:50,016
Hm?

1148
01:30:50,103 --> 01:30:53,187
Whatever they're paying you...

1149
01:31:00,029 --> 01:31:01,440
Oh.

1150
01:31:02,365 --> 01:31:03,610
There is nobody.

1151
01:31:05,952 --> 01:31:07,991
I did this to you.

1152
01:31:10,998 --> 01:31:12,196
- Me.
- You.

1153
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:14,751
Me.

1154
01:31:20,883 --> 01:31:22,923
Who are you?

1155
01:31:25,596 --> 01:31:27,590
<i>BRIKOWSKl: Who is he?</i>

1156
01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:32,011
Considering he no longer has fingerprints,
I'd say it's unlikely we'll ever know.

1157
01:31:32,103 --> 01:31:33,930
What about dental records?

1158
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:39,609
Sure, find the bottom half of the jaw, then all
we need to do is find out who the dentist was.

1159
01:31:40,445 --> 01:31:42,484
What a fucking mess.

1160
01:31:43,865 --> 01:31:46,237
<i>Hey, Brikowski, it's Marty, you there?</i>

1161
01:31:46,325 --> 01:31:50,405
<i>We found two more bodies
to go along with the two you've already got.</i>

1162
01:31:50,496 --> 01:31:52,536
All right, I'll be right over.

1163
01:31:52,624 --> 01:31:56,953
Did you ever get a hold of The Rabbi so he can
get down here and identify what's left of his kid?

1164
01:31:57,045 --> 01:32:00,413
<i>Negative.
We've been calling for the last hour, no answer.</i>

1165
01:32:00,506 --> 01:32:02,000
Send somebody over.

1166
01:32:02,091 --> 01:32:03,289
<i>Copy.</i>

1167
01:32:05,303 --> 01:32:08,138
You all right? You look a little shook-up.

1168
01:32:08,222 --> 01:32:10,096
No, I'm fine.

1169
01:32:10,183 --> 01:32:12,222
All right.

1170
01:32:35,666 --> 01:32:38,869
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, Brikowski, it's Murphy.</i>

1171
01:32:38,961 --> 01:32:40,539
Hey, Murph, what's up?

1172
01:32:40,629 --> 01:32:43,750
<i>Harry Kello came by today.
You remember Harry?</i>

1173
01:32:43,842 --> 01:32:47,709
He retired a few years ago. His wife just died,
so he comes in a couple of times a week,

1174
01:32:47,803 --> 01:32:49,843
talks shop, tells stories to the rooks.

1175
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:53,631
Starts every sentence with, "The way
things used to be". Guy living in the past.

1176
01:32:53,726 --> 01:32:56,300
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, what about him?
- We're making small talk.</i>

1177
01:32:56,396 --> 01:33:00,014
Guy says he can't complain,
then all he does is fuckin' complain.

1178
01:33:00,107 --> 01:33:03,523
His dead wife, the leg he got shot in,
his crappy pension,

1179
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:07,312
but then he stops when he sees the picture
Marty snapped of your kid.

1180
01:33:07,407 --> 01:33:11,238
Just stares at it.
I say, "What is it? You know the kid?"

1181
01:33:11,327 --> 01:33:14,079
Thing is, he ain't looking at the picture,
but at the name.

1182
01:33:14,163 --> 01:33:17,579
I've got it written at the bottom.
He knows that name: Slevin.

1183
01:33:37,645 --> 01:33:39,684
I have that same phone.

1184
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:56,537
<i>About an hour later the phone rings, it's Harry,
talking like a goddamned machine gun,</i>

1185
01:33:56,623 --> 01:33:59,113
going on and on about a horse race back in '79.

1186
01:34:02,003 --> 01:34:04,042
<i>Aqueduct.</i>

1187
01:34:05,089 --> 01:34:07,330
Seven horse, tenth race - ring a bell?

1188
01:34:08,468 --> 01:34:10,507
<i>(Race start bell)</i>

1189
01:34:15,099 --> 01:34:17,138
<i>It was a drug store handicap.</i>

1190
01:34:17,226 --> 01:34:21,271
<i>Big wind-up, around the time The Boss,
The Rabbi set up shop in New York,</i>

1191
01:34:21,356 --> 01:34:24,392
<i>before people started
waking up with knives in their backs.</i>

1192
01:34:24,484 --> 01:34:29,192
Anyway, he goes on about this local legend,
about this kid.

1193
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,071
His name was Max.

1194
01:34:33,952 --> 01:34:37,735
<i>Max placed a bet with a bookie named Roth.</i>

1195
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:40,072
Roth laid the bet off.

1196
01:34:40,166 --> 01:34:41,743
On you.

1197
01:34:51,218 --> 01:34:53,045
And you.

1198
01:34:59,936 --> 01:35:02,723
But when The Rabbi and The Boss
find out the fix is in,

1199
01:35:02,813 --> 01:35:04,853
they are the opposite of happy.

1200
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:07,976
Word comes down an example is to be made.

1201
01:35:08,068 --> 01:35:08,850
Aargh!

1202
01:35:08,944 --> 01:35:11,270
These guys kill everyone!

1203
01:35:11,364 --> 01:35:12,609
<i>And I mean every one.</i>

1204
01:35:13,699 --> 01:35:16,985
<i>Max, his wife, his kid, Roth...</i>

1205
01:35:17,077 --> 01:35:18,986
<i>even the goddamned horse died.</i>

1206
01:35:19,079 --> 01:35:22,697
These guys went to town with a tomahawk.
It was a fucking massacre.

1207
01:35:24,418 --> 01:35:28,630
<i>They had to bring in a specialist to do the kid
cos nobody would take thejob.</i>

1208
01:35:46,565 --> 01:35:48,854
What have you done with my son?

1209
01:36:05,167 --> 01:36:06,910
You?

1210
01:36:07,002 --> 01:36:09,078
No.

1211
01:36:09,171 --> 01:36:11,459
You're dead.

1212
01:36:13,009 --> 01:36:15,416
You're dead!

1213
01:36:21,642 --> 01:36:25,854
<i>So Harry's going on about how they had to
bring in a specialist to kill the kid,</i>

1214
01:36:25,938 --> 01:36:30,149
but I ain't seeing the connection,
so I says, "What has this to do with the case?"

1215
01:36:30,234 --> 01:36:32,273
<i>He says, "The horse's name."</i>

1216
01:36:32,361 --> 01:36:34,484
<i>I say, "What about the horse's name?"</i>

1217
01:36:34,571 --> 01:36:38,985
<i>He says the horse's name was
Lucky Number Slevin.</i>

1218
01:36:39,076 --> 01:36:41,069
- What is your name?
- Slevin Kelevra.

1219
01:36:50,296 --> 01:36:52,335
Do you remember this part?

1220
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:06,101
Please! I have a family.

1221
01:37:06,187 --> 01:37:08,096
Not any more, you don't.

1222
01:37:08,188 --> 01:37:09,980
Henry! (Sobs)

1223
01:37:12,067 --> 01:37:14,106
You fucking bastards!

1224
01:37:15,821 --> 01:37:18,443
You fucking bastards!

1225
01:37:37,801 --> 01:37:40,375
The two of you killed everything I ever loved.

1226
01:37:46,643 --> 01:37:48,683
Fuck you both.

1227
01:38:13,128 --> 01:38:18,123
<i>Now, there is no such person as Slevin Kelevra,
as far as I can tell.</i>

1228
01:38:18,217 --> 01:38:20,459
<i>Which means the kid was using a pseudonym.</i>

1229
01:38:20,552 --> 01:38:23,589
<i>Which is interesting,
him picking the name of a dead racehorse</i>

1230
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:26,005
and keeping company
with The Boss and The Rabbi,

1231
01:38:26,099 --> 01:38:29,350
seeing as they had some involvement
with that very horse.

1232
01:38:29,437 --> 01:38:32,106
<i>I thought to myself, mayb e it means something.</i>

1233
01:38:32,189 --> 01:38:37,064
<i>Then again, mayb e it'sjust a coincidence,
name's gotta come from someplace - right?</i>

1234
01:38:37,152 --> 01:38:40,852
<i>I guess none of this really matters
now that the kid's gone cold.</i>

1235
01:38:45,869 --> 01:38:49,036
<i>Ah, one more thing,
we've got a new guy in the precinct.</i>

1236
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:52,327
<i>Jewish fella, funny little guy, talks a lot.</i>

1237
01:38:53,835 --> 01:38:58,794
<i>Anyway, in case you're interested,
he says the name Kelevra is Hebrew.</i>

1238
01:38:58,882 --> 01:39:01,088
<i>He says it means...</i>

1239
01:39:01,176 --> 01:39:03,215
Bad dog.

1240
01:39:09,768 --> 01:39:12,437
<i>BRIKOWSKl:
20 years ago, he used to be my bookie.</i>

1241
01:39:12,521 --> 01:39:14,679
<i>I used to sign my pay cheques over to him.</i>

1242
01:39:30,872 --> 01:39:32,912
Brikowski? You there?

1243
01:41:27,447 --> 01:41:29,238
<i>Your girl made me.</i>

1244
01:41:31,034 --> 01:41:33,073
She took my picture.

1245
01:41:34,037 --> 01:41:36,077
She's got to go in the ground.

1246
01:41:38,417 --> 01:41:39,412
OK.

1247
01:42:00,981 --> 01:42:03,020
I have something I have to tell you.

1248
01:42:05,694 --> 01:42:07,733
He told me that we needed to kill you.

1249
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:15,157
You're gonna have to trust me.

1250
01:42:26,632 --> 01:42:28,671
Shit!

1251
01:42:31,594 --> 01:42:33,634
He's going to shoot you here.

1252
01:43:31,154 --> 01:43:33,193
I didn't think you'd understand.

1253
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:52,465
I understood.

1254
01:43:57,305 --> 01:43:59,344
How did you find out about us?

1255
01:43:59,432 --> 01:44:01,674
I'm a world-class assassin, fuckhead.

1256
01:44:01,767 --> 01:44:03,807
How do you think I found out?

1257
01:44:07,482 --> 01:44:09,391
I thought you might want this.

1258
01:44:49,232 --> 01:44:51,058
I want to go home.

1259
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:53,522
Neither of us is going home for a long time, kid.

1260
01:44:57,365 --> 01:44:59,405
My name is Goodkat.

1261
01:45:00,493 --> 01:45:02,532
You can call me Mr Goodkat.
