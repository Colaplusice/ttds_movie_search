1
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,821
<i>Existence.</i>

2
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,106
<i>Well, what does it matter?</i>

3
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,749
<i>I exist on the best terms I can.</i>

4
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,342
<i>The past is now part of my future.</i>

5
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,502
<i>The present is well out of hand.</i>

6
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,829
Get it.

7
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,340
Ian. Pass us the ball, will you?

8
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,307
Knob cheese.

9
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,341
All right, Ian?

10
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,419
Ian.

11
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,829
Oh, you got it.

12
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,184
Today.

13
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,385
This is Deborah, you know,
who I told you about.

14
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,142
From the youth club.

15
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,739
You can't be in my gang
if you don't smoke.

16
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,987
Don't wanna be in your gang.

17
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,228
Neither do I.

18
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,101
I think we should go.

19
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,867
- Now?
- Yeah. I wanna go.

20
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,659
OK.

21
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,422
Ian, we're getting off.

22
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,340
- Who's the writer?
- Who'd you think?

23
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,943
Glucose...

24
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,748
...plus oxygen...

25
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,744
Carbon dioxide plus water.

26
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,865
You can clearly see here
that the chemicals

27
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,339
are currently out of balance.

28
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,820
Your task will be
to alter the molar ratios

29
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,550
in order to make the chemicals balance

30
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,828
before and after the combustion
reaction has occurred.

31
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,909
Wouldn't you say that was so,
Mr Curtis?

32
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,661
Ian?

33
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,502
Come on, stop messing.

34
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,501
Uh, Mr Curtis?

35
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,589
What?

36
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,023
Sorry, sir.

37
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,068
Who have we got today, then?

38
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,902
Mrs Brady.

39
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,420
- We done her before?
- Don't think so.

40
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,707
Let's hope she's got
a sympathetic doctor.

41
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,105
I mean, I like
me neighbours, don't get me wrong.

42
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,546
Mind you, the stink of some of them.

43
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,508
I tell you, they don't wash
or don't know how to.

44
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,990
Stink, stink, stink.

45
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,502
Stink to high heaven of piss.

46
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,140
Mrs Brady, please can I use
your toilet, please?

47
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,902
'Course you can, love.

48
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,060
- Second on the left, down the hall.
- Thank you.

49
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,022
Where was I?

50
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,828
Oh, yes.

51
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,062
It says here Cirazapan usually
prescribed for schizophrenia.

52
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:31,020
Side effects include drowsiness,
apathy, agitation

53
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,545
and blurred vision.

54
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,229
I'm taking two.

55
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,986
Oh, here we go. Who's that?

56
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,186
Stop it now! Stop it.

57
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,589
- Hi.
- Hi, Nick.

58
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,264
Nick, yeah. Hi.

59
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,468
- Ian.
- Hi.

60
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,109
Hi.

61
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,501
Oh, wow, a dog. What's her name?

62
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,547
- Tess.
- Hello, Tess.

63
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,178
Come around to speak to, you know...

64
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,069
See if she wants to... for a bit.

65
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,506
- Debbie.
- Debbie, yeah. Yeah.

66
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,260
Debbie. Hi.

67
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,740
- Hi.
- She's gorgeous. Debbie, hi.

68
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,061
Hi. Do you want to come in?

69
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,819
Hi.

70
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,739
Hi.

71
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,910

- Did you write that?
- Wordsworth.

81
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,549
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

82
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,590
- I'm really excited for this.
- Yeah. Same here.

83
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,389
Never really into Bowie before,
you know, but...

84
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,142
It's a shame Nick couldn't come.

85
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,422
He did say I could go out with you.

86
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,105
He said it was all right.
As long as I looked after you.

87
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,343
Did he now?

88
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,424
Well, I didn't want him thinking we were
going behind his back or anything.

89
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,705
That's a bit presumptuous,
don't you think?

90
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,669
Why?

91
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,866
I might not have wanted
to go out with you.

92
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,624
- Go over there.
- All right.

Are you asking?

103
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,908
You're mine.

104
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,581
Irretrievably.

105
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,749
- Am I now?
- Yeah.

106
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,989
And you know it.

107
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,340
Ian?

108
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,909
I've got a brew for you.

109
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,749
Ian?

110
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,979
All right, lads?

111
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,742
- All right.
- All right, mate.

112
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,907
It's a bit empty in here tonight.

113
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,106
- Tony Wilson's over there.
- Who?

114
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,900
Posh bloke from Granada TV.

115
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,107
- Oh, yeah.
- One day he'll be recognising me.

116
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,342
- You'll have to be out a bit more.
- Yeah.

117
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,389
Been a bit busy.

118
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,825
Getting married, finding a house.

119
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,343
Sounds like fun.

120
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,980
- How's the band?
- Yeah. Not bad.

121
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,380
It's not particularly good
either, is it?

122
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,342
No. We're pretty shite.

123
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,582
Be a lot less shite if we could find
a singer who could sing.

124
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,908
I'm really looking forward
to seeing this lot tonight.

125
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,107
Apparently they tear up the stage
and kick off mid-set.

126
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,741
- All right?
- Gotta go.

127
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,424
- Take it easy.
- See you soon, Ian.

128
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,023
- Embarrassed of me or something?
- No.

129
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,819
- He's all right, him, isn't he?
- Yeah.

130
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,458
A bit tall, bit odd, but yeah.

131
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,068
So you're really
looking for a singer, then?

132
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,823
So, what do you like doing, Colin?

133
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,981
Watching telly.

134
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:46,178
- Apart from watching telly?
- Hmm, having breakfast, lunch and tea.

135
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,261
Food? Well, that's a start.

136
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,660
There's plenty of jobs
that involve food.

137
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,979
And watch telly.

138
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,426
- So you like food and watching telly?
- That's right.

139
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,658
Well...

140
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,822
There's a job here working
at Knutsford Cinema

141
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,504
behind the hot dog counter.
How does that sound?

142
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,662
- I do not like hot dogs!
- OK.

143
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,264
Well, should we give 'em
a ring anyway?

144
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,660
The colour scheme is fuckin' brown

145
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,183
Everywhere in chicken town

146
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,660
The fuckin' pubs are fuckin' dull
The fuckin' clubs are fuckin' full

147
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,582
Of fuckin' girls and fuckin' guys
With fuckin' murder in their eyes

148
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,139
A fuckin' bloke gets fuckin' stabbed
Waitin' for a fuckin' cab

149
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,949
You fuckin' stay at fuckin' home
The fuckin' neighbours fuckin' moan

150
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,499
Keep the fuckin' racket down
This is fuckin' chicken town

151
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,306
I'm a bit nervous, me.

152
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,820
Just with it being recorded
and all that.

153
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,659
I mean, we're actually
gonna be on a record.

154
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,900
I can play it at my gran's
and everything.

155
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,340
How about you, Hooky?
You nervous or what?

156
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,102
Am I fuck, man?

157
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,982
- What about you, Ian?
- This is just the start.

158
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,259
Steven?

159
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,068
No.

160
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,510
The fuckin' pies are fuckin' old
The fuckin' chips are fuckin' cold

161
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,184
The fuckin' beer is fuckin' flat
The fuckin' flats have fuckin' rats

162
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,103
The fuckin' clocks are fuckin' wrong
The fuckin' days are fuckin' long

163
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,421
It fuckin' gets you fuckin' down
Evidently chicken town

164
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,989
Thank you. Good night.

165
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,467
Right, Warsaw, we're on.

166
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,020
Fuckin' hell! Who's opened the ham?
You lot nervous or what?

167
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,386
The next band of the night, folks:

168
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,589
Warsaw!

169
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,580
You all forgotten Rudolf Hess?

170
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,582
Ian, it's 400 pound.

171
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,661
Are you sure you want to do this?

172
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,661
I know, but...

173
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,980
The band are gonna pay us back.

174
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,309
OK.

175
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,987
Let's have a baby.

176
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,058
OK.

177
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,947
Four hundred quid.

178
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,588
What are you lot called again?

179
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,423
We were Warsaw.
Now we're Joy Division.

180
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,309
Excuse me, but what happened
to Slaves of Venus?

181
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,903
OK.

182
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,343
- All right. Joy Division's good.
- Joy Division, eh?

183
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,341
What's all that about?

184
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,425
It's the name of a brothel German
soldiers used during World War II.

185
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,068
Well, whatever. Studio's yours.

186
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,989
And it folds up to hold the record.

187
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,418
Have a look.

188
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,421
Yeah, it's good that, Bernard.

189
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,422
Thought-provoking.

190
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,344
That's right. Her name's Corrine Lewis.

191
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,341
Is 2.45 Thursday all right?

192
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,659
OK, then, Mr Mathers,
she'll see you then.

193
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,989
Bye.

194
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,423
Done. He sounds keen.

195
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,309
I'll get some water.

196
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,982
<i>When you're looking at life
in a strange new room</i>

197
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,748
<i>Maybe drowning soon</i>

198
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,663
<i>Is this the start of it all?</i>

199
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,501
I'd never stand for that.

200
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,668
What?

201
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,344
Being called something like
"the Buzzcocks".

202
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,341
What are you on about?

203
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,820
I don't know. I don't mind the Buzz,
but calling themselves Cocks.

204
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,901
I don't get it.

205
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,709
They're not calling themselves
the Cocks, are they?

206
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,065
They're calling themselves
the Buzzcocks.

207
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,943
Still got the word "cock" in it, though.

208
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,578
Just saying I wouldn't stand for it,
that's all.

209
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,739
Shh!

210
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:43,028
<i>They were the Buzzcocks.
If you didn't know, well, now you do.</i>

211
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,943
<i>- As you'll soon know about these lot...
- That's us!</i>

212
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,908
<i>... a Manchester band called
Joy Division. This is an EP,</i>

213
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,743
<i>An Ideal for Living.
And that wraps it up for tonight.</i>

214
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,585
<i>Keep the music coming in. Next week
we have The Clash, live in the studio.</i>

215
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,900
We've just been on telly, lads.

216
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,584
So is Tony Wilson a fan,
then, or what?

217
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,149
That was bollocks.

218
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,505
He didn't even say if he liked it
or anything.

219
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,503
- 'Course he liked it.
- Well, how do you know?

220
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,183
He waved it
in front of camera like that.

221
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,342
Forget the record.
He's got to put us on.

222
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,978
Hiya.

223
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,549
There he is.

224
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,344
Um, just orange juice, please.

225
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,023
Go on, tell him.

226
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,784
OK, how are you?

227
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,510
You're gonna go out there,
it's all gonna be fine.

228
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,739
You're not up there having a wank, OK?

229
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,309
Think.

230
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,186
You're a twat, you are.
You're a bastard.

231
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,419
Am I? Why is that?

232
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,706
Because you haven't
put us on television.

233
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,266
Well, then, you'll be the next band
I'll put on, darling.

234
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,309
Fuckin' right we're going on
before your band, twat!

235
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,540
Your band ain't even
a real fuckin' band.

236
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,780
- Fuck off.
- Hooky'll do your head in.

237
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,747
Fuck off!

238
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,982
That was superb, that, lads.
It really was.

239
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,666
I've not seen a reaction like that

240
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,628
since George Best got kicked out
for blasting a bouncer.

241
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,826
I know how you can be better...
like that.

242
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,749
- Go on, then.
- Simple. You employ me.

243
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,502
You play, I manage.

244
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,265
We all get stinkin' rich and go buy
fuckin' great big houses in Cheshire.

245
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,148
- Job's a good 'un.
- And who are you?

246
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,619
Rob Gretton. I already manage
a couple of bands.

247
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,463
But they couldn't sniff the sweat
round your bollocks.

248
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,905
You lot are somethin' else.
I hold my hands up.

249
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,789
I am a believer in Joy Division.
Fuckin' hallelujah.

250
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,906
I'm also resident DJ here,

251
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,540
which means I know anyone of any
music biz use anywhere in this city.

252
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:54,020
I'll have you lot signed within
the month. In fact, I guarantee it.

253
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,545
We've already got a manager,
haven't we, lads?

254
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,382
- Who's that, then?
- Fuckin' me.

255
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,102
- What's your name, mate?
- Terry.

256
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,669
- Terry what?
- Terry Mason.

257
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,867
Terry Mason. Tez.
You mind if I call you Tez?

258
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,946
Tez, you know jack shit about this
business. Wanna know how I know?

259
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,828
'Cause I haven't heard of you.

260
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,948
I bet you haven't even got
a fuckin' telephone, have you?

261
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,821
Didn't think so. How will you book gigs

262
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,185
and cut deals without a phone,
you daft cunt?

263
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,022
No offence. I call everyone that.

264
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,988
Look, I've got to pack up my gig.
Ring me.

265
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,818
Rob's Records, Rob speaking.

266
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,741
All right, Ian. Yeah, good, yeah.

267
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,260
Well, that's fuckin' brilliant, Ian.

268
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,827
Well, I'll speak to you later, then.

269
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,579
Fine, I understand.

270
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,662
But you've got to sign with Factory.
This isn't an issue.

271
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,266
We're a fresh and exciting label,
you're a fresh and exciting band.

272
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:26,218
And, most importantly, we both fly
the flag for the Republic of Manchester.

273
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,745
- Don't give a fuck about that.
- I'm a royalist.

274
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,663
- And I suppose they're Nazis as well.
- We're not Nazis.

275
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,503
<i>- What about the money?
- It's 50l50 on the profits.</i>

276
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,980
You own all the publishing rights
and can walk away at any time.

277
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,823
- You serious?
- Rob...

278
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,982
I don't fuck about with talent
I want to work with.

279
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,946
I'll even sign the contracts in my
own blood if it'll make you happy.

280
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,623
We'll speak later, then.

281
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,819
Now remember, we are live,
so no swearing or they will cut you off.

282
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,821
- What about "arse"?
- What?

283
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,141
- Is "arse" a swear word?
- "Arse", yes. It's a swear word.

284
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,028
- No, it's not.
- Bernard,

285
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,909
out there I know
"arse" isn't a swear word.

286
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:10,427
Here, in TV land,
"arse" is most definitely a swear word.

287
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,821
Trust me, I know
all about swearing and TV.

288
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,062
I'm a master of knowing
when I can and when I can't.

289
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,903
What about "big dog's cock"?
Can you say that?

290
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,899
No.

291
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,188
Seeing as how this is
the first television programme

292
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,103
which brought you the
first appearances from everyone

293
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,023
from The Beatles to the Buzzcocks,
we like to think we bring you

294
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,943
the most new and interesting sounds
in the North-West.

295
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,465
They're called Joy Division,
a Manchester band

296
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,623
except for the guitarist who comes from
Salford. A very important distinction.

297
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,269
<i>This is called Transmission.</i>

298
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,627
I can't believe you did it.

299
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,741
Must have lost about half a pint.

300
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,821
Shows he's serious, though.

301
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,788
- How you feelin', Tony?
- Mmm.

302
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,941
I've felt better.

303
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,139
Hold on. You spelled Morriss wrong.
It's supposed to be double S.

304
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,427
Tony, you're gonna have to add
another S to this, kid.

305
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,625
Do I have to?

306
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:58,180
It's not very professional to spell
the drummer's name wrong, is it?

307
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,501
Job's a good 'un. Thanks, Tony.

308
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,748
So...

309
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,706
...I can officially announce
to the press

310
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,826
Joy Division have signed with Factory?

311
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,460
Can you fuck? I'll give you a ring
and arrange a proper meeting Monday.

312
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,900
Bit of a drama queen, isn't he?

313
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,023
Ian...

314
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,908
...please come to bed.

315
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:08,259
Right, Geoff, well,
there's your reference.

316
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,829
Thank you.

317
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,139
- That's fine.
- Well, good luck with it.

318
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,266
Thank you very much.

319
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,148
We are gonna be late, you know.

320
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,902
All right?

321
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:29,264
- What's up?
- Bloody dying with the flu.

322
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,341
He's all right,
just a bit of a sniffle.

323
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,388
He's fuckin' scared of playing
London for the first time.

324
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,983
Chocks away.

325
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,387
Well, that was shit.

326
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,984
First gig in London,
there's nobody there.

327
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,786
And now I'm freezing.

328
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,829
I told you it's broke.

329
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,107
Well, you're probably just too thick
to work it properly.

330
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,704
It's a heater, Ian.
You turn it on and it heats up.

331
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,259
And that one doesn't, 'cause it's broke.

332
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,500
Give us a go on your sleeping bag.

333
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:09,342
- I'm dying here.
- Ten minutes. I'll give you it back.

334
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,422
- No.
- Don't be so spoilt.

335
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:15,024
- I'm not. I'm dying!
- You've got a little cold

336
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,828
and that's it, babyface!

337
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,981
- Hey!
- Fuck off!

338
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,620
- Pack it in, the pair of you.
- Ten minutes, I'll give it back!

339
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,348
I'm gonna crash the bloody car.

340
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,422
- Ian, you fuckin' menk!
- Ian, calm it, mate!

341
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,423
Fuckin' hell.

342
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,501
Pull over. Steve, pull over.

343
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,026
Hooky, quick, quick, give us a hand.

344
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,829
Yeah, I've got his knees.

345
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,308
Fuckin' hell.

346
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,818
Ian, what's up with you, mate?

347
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,703
Fuck, I thought he was just
trying to warm himself up.

348
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,342
This isn't right, this, Rob.

349
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:24,182
- What's the story, then?
- He's had some kind of fit.

350
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,908
Oh, right. They're clever,
these doctors, aren't they?

351
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,540
- What kind?
- Epilepsy. They're not sure.

352
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,503
I thought epilepsy
was only for head-the-balls.

353
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,424
- What?
- Head-the-balls. Spaccas.

354
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,581
Nice, Hooky, nice.

355
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,421
- So is he gonna be all right?
- He's not said a lot.

356
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,546
Well, if he were chatty we'd be worried.

357
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,742
We'll try you on...
carbamazepine...

358
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:03,269
...phenytoin,
tiagabine and oxcarbazipine,

359
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:08,823
to be taken with the, uh, phenobarbital
that they gave you at the hospital.

360
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,584
In the meantime you'll be
on the waiting list to see

361
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,389
a neurologist specialist
at Macclesfield General.

362
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,744
You should also be getting
plenty of early nights

363
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,185
and steering away from alcohol.

364
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,184
It's a matter of trial and error

365
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:31,467
until the right drug or
combination of drugs is found.

366
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,428
Some might work.

367
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,662
And... are there any side effects?

368
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:54,187
Carbamazepine's side effects
include skin rash,

369
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,499
double vision, drowsiness, dizziness,

370
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,389
gastric disturbances...
That means farting.

371
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:05,501
Phenytoin's side effects
include drowsiness,

372
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,264
acne, overgrowth of the gums,

373
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,467
nausea, vomiting, mental confusion,

374
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,190
mental slowing. That's it.

375
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,659
Ian, you're
gonna be late for work.

376
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,058
Ian?

377
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,827
Ian.

378
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,902
Uh, I'm sorry, Earnest.
I must have drifted off.

379
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,062
- You all right?
- Mmm.

380
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,228
It's these tablets.

381
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,904
Yeah, well, them and
the late night concerts, eh?

382
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,821
Listen, um...

383
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:03,141
I'm not sure you can do
both jobs, Ian,

384
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:06,666
so just have a little think
about it, yeah?

385
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:10,982
As your supervisor I do need you
to have a think about it, all right?

386
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,829
Yeah.

387
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,060
Hello, is Corrine there, please?

388
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,579
It's Ian Curtis from
the Employment Exchange.

389
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,105
I was just wondering how she'd been...

390
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,828
What?

391
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,989
Just like that?

392
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,502
From having a fit?

393
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,387
I didn't know that could...

394
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:03,181
Oh. I'm so, so sorry.

395
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,909
Ian, love,
I'm going to bed now.

396
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,668
Are you comin'?

397
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,589
All right?

398
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:27,229
Hi. They wouldn't let me in.
My name weren't on the guest list.

399
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,379
I didn't know.

400
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,984
Somebody should've.
It's bloody embarrassing.

401
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,505
No, I didn't know you were pregnant.

402
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:03,783
- Hiya.
- All right, Debbie?

403
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:06,339
- Where's Ian?
- Congratulations.

404
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:11,102
Oh, don't look so shocked, Rob.
It's been comin' a long time.

405
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:29,829
Hiya.

406
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:32,308
What are you doing here?

407
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:38,069
- She's a mate of Hooky's.
- Right.

408
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:41,302
Hi. I'm Ian's wife.

409
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:44,229
Hi.

410
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:50,022
Do you think it's right for you
to be out in your condition?

411
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,104
Ian.

412
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,783
Ian.

413
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,225
Come on, into the pain.

414
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:31,426
Keep going...
I've got the head, Debbie.

415
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,660
Well done, well done. One last time.

416
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,149
- One last time.
- I can't.

417
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,107
Go on. Yes, you can,
you can, you can.

418
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,626
Good girl. Well done.

419
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:44,908
Good. That's great.

420
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:47,345
Here we are. That's right.

421
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,342
Ah, here we are. It's a girl.

422
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,581
Ohh!

423
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,909
Congratulations.

424
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:00,264
Mum and Dad.

425
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:11,104
Hello. Hello.

426
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,908
Hey.

427
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,149
I need a cig.

428
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,581
Silklands Nightclub.

429
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,182
Part-time barmaid.

430
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,422
One pound ten an hour.

431
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,899
Mum and Dad can look after Natalie.

432
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:38,787
What do you think?

433
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:43,669
Well, it won't be for long.

434
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:47,583
I'll take care of you as soon
as the new album comes out.

435
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,264
Well, what happened
to that tenner I gave you?

436
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:43,184
Well, my wages are the same
as everyone else's.

437
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:52,548
- Talk to Ian, you know. Find out.
- Mmm-hmm.

438
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:54,109
OK.

439
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:58,468
- No promises.
- All right, I'll ask him.

440
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:00,989
Look, I've gotta go.

441
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,580
Give Natalie a kiss for me.

442
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:08,909
I love you too.

443
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:18,819
Not bad, eh?

444
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:23,106
The journalist makes us out to be
a bunch of pricks. Who gives a fuck?

445
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,420
A bunch of cool pricks,
that's what I say.

446
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:28,579
- Who's that?
- Some French bird.

447
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,069
Wants to do an interview.

448
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:33,663
She's not a Frenchy.
She's, uh, she's a Belgy.

449
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,105
- What did you tell her?
- I said I'd ask,

450
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,420
but it's unlikely to happen now.

451
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:41,662
It's only a crappy European fanzine.

452
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,742
Well, I'm all right.
Why don't we do it tonight?

453
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,579
We can invite her back
to where we're staying.

454
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:52,106
- What's her name?
- Annik.

455
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:56,058
Annik. Different.

456
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:57,743
It's foreign.

457
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,148
I'll have a word, boss.

458
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:04,987
<i>Annik? Hola.</i>

459
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,101
Come on, then. Let's have it.

460
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:25,658
OK.

461
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:29,106
OK, so, um...
Do you like the Buzzcocks?

462
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,342
They're a good laugh.

463
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:36,820
Yeah, they're all right,
apart from the "cocks" bit.

464
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:42,546
There you go.

465
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:45,861
What is the most beautiful thing
you've seen in your life?

466
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:51,060
I saw a beautiful drum kit down at
Johnny Roadhouse's shop once.

467
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:56,504
What about music?
Is that beautiful?

468
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,661
Some of it.

469
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:02,387
What about Joy Division's music?

470
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:04,825
Some of it, yeah, but...

471
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:07,458
...some of it's
not meant to be beautiful.

472
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:15,947
Does anyone believe in love?

473
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:21,264
I believe in pure... sex.

474
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:25,546
I believe in feeling, yeah.

475
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:28,509
What does that mean?

476
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:32,501
You know, like if I had a car,

477
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:35,309
and I felt love for the car
and somebody kicked my car.

478
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:38,701
I'd be as upset as if
they kicked my girlfriend.

479
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:48,185
So you're not a journalist, then?

480
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:50,818
It's a hobby thing, not a full-time job.

481
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:56,059
I work for the Belgian embassy,
for the chancellor.

482
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,741
Sounds interesting.

483
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:01,980
Free, independent woman.

484
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,141
I suppose so, yes.

485
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:14,820
Tell me about Macclesfield.

486
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:20,501
It's grey, it's miserable.

487
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,820
I've wanted to escape it my whole life.

488
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,182
What about your wife?

489
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,387
She loves it in Macclesfield.

490
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:46,740
You were married so young.

491
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:50,183
I've never heard of people
marrying so young.

492
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:52,548
Yeah, I know.

493
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:00,739
My marriage was a mistake.

494
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:15,738
- Are you tired?
- Mmm-hmm.

495
00:56:26,664 --> 00:56:29,178
Ian?

496
00:56:35,864 --> 00:56:36,853
Ian?

497
00:57:02,104 --> 00:57:03,856
What time are they coming for you?

498
00:57:05,104 --> 00:57:06,423
Half an hour.

499
00:57:06,864 --> 00:57:08,855
Right. I'm gonna nip to the shop.

500
00:57:09,024 --> 00:57:10,582
Back in a minute, OK?

501
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:50,061
You got your passport, Ian?

502
00:57:54,264 --> 00:57:56,380
Up the continental in the rental.
Come on.

503
00:58:32,864 --> 00:58:34,183
Fresh air.

504
00:58:35,104 --> 00:58:36,583
All right, love?

505
00:58:38,344 --> 00:58:39,333
- Hi.
- Hi.

506
00:58:39,504 --> 00:58:40,732
Hiya.

507
00:58:44,704 --> 00:58:46,217
I'll get in the back this time.

508
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,856
Hi, Debbie.

509
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:46,933
I must have been out
when you called.

510
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:50,064
It was hard to get to a phone.

511
00:59:56,704 --> 00:59:58,695
Come on, girl. Yeah.

512
00:59:58,864 --> 01:00:01,662
Come on, girl.

513
01:00:09,864 --> 01:00:12,173
Did you remember to take your pills?

514
01:00:12,344 --> 01:00:13,663
Yeah.

515
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:19,094
Are they working?

516
01:00:21,104 --> 01:00:22,901
I had an attack in Berlin.

517
01:00:23,224 --> 01:00:25,579
Oh, Ian, if they're not working

518
01:00:25,744 --> 01:00:29,373
we need to get you a doctor's
appointment to change the medication.

519
01:00:35,024 --> 01:00:37,094
We really missed you.

520
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:46,333
Oh, there's this girl at work
called Claire,

521
01:00:46,504 --> 01:00:49,496
and, uh, she's invited us
to her flat warming party.

522
01:00:49,664 --> 01:00:51,302
Hasn't she?

523
01:00:51,464 --> 01:00:54,979
And I said, um, that we'd go. 'Cause
Mum and Dad can look after Natalie.

524
01:00:55,144 --> 01:00:57,180
That way we get a lie in. Don't we?

525
01:01:01,104 --> 01:01:04,460
Daddy. Daddy's home.

526
01:01:04,624 --> 01:01:06,421
- Do you like the Buzzcocks?
- Yeah.

527
01:01:06,584 --> 01:01:08,336
We're on tour with them as well.

528
01:01:08,504 --> 01:01:11,780
Don't know what you were
worried about. He fits in fine.

529
01:01:11,944 --> 01:01:16,017
But he can seem a bit distant
to people he don't know. Trust me.

530
01:01:18,264 --> 01:01:20,255
Do you trust him when he's away?

531
01:01:20,424 --> 01:01:24,576
- You know, with other girls.
- Totally.

532
01:01:27,064 --> 01:01:30,739
He's so protective, you know.
He hates me wearing short skirts.

533
01:01:31,704 --> 01:01:33,581
Goes mad if I talk to other blokes.

534
01:01:35,704 --> 01:01:38,093
He is quite famous now,
though, isn't he?

535
01:01:39,104 --> 01:01:40,298
Not to me.

536
01:01:41,504 --> 01:01:43,142
I still wash his underpants.

537
01:01:49,024 --> 01:01:51,015
Do you want to sleep with other men?

538
01:01:51,184 --> 01:01:52,503
What?

539
01:01:52,664 --> 01:01:54,780
Do you want to sleep with other men?

540
01:01:57,424 --> 01:01:59,415
That's a strange question.

541
01:02:00,944 --> 01:02:03,822
Because... if you did...

542
01:02:05,184 --> 01:02:06,583
...it'd be OK.

543
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:09,823
I'd be OK.

544
01:02:11,784 --> 01:02:13,581
Are you being serious?

545
01:02:17,264 --> 01:02:21,018
When you say a thing like that it makes
me think you don't love me anymore.

546
01:02:23,864 --> 01:02:25,661
I don't think I do.

Kill it, kill it.

554
01:04:54,864 --> 01:04:56,934
- Something's up.
- What?

555
01:04:57,104 --> 01:04:59,379
Rob's got one of his cheesy grins
going again.

556
01:04:59,544 --> 01:05:01,853
You've been spending our wages,
Rob, or what?

557
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:04,584
Come on, then,
you twisted bastard, out with it.

558
01:05:05,584 --> 01:05:09,133
It's all happenin', boys.
Pack your bags, saddle up.

559
01:05:09,304 --> 01:05:12,979
Nineteenth of May we're off to the
US of fuckin' A for a two-week tour.

- You're joking?
- We're gonna be contenders.

561
01:05:18,344 --> 01:05:20,016
We're gonna be somebodies.

562
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:22,383
How'd you wangle that one?

563
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:25,456
I put a lackey band
around Tony's cock and balls.

564
01:05:25,624 --> 01:05:26,818
Did it drop off?

565
01:05:27,664 --> 01:05:30,178
I thought we'd celebrate.
Bring them here, Terry.

566
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:31,663
Nice one.

Eh?

570
01:06:16,344 --> 01:06:18,175
How long have you been seeing her?

571
01:06:24,184 --> 01:06:27,415
Answer me, Ian! Don't ignore me!

572
01:06:33,424 --> 01:06:34,903

Just answer me, Ian!
Please answer me!

580
01:07:39,584 --> 01:07:41,097

01:08:43,504 --> 01:08:45,256
Sorry, Debbie.

584
01:08:49,264 --> 01:08:50,743
I owe you everything.

585
01:08:55,184 --> 01:08:56,822
I love you.

What does that mean?

587
01:09:06,784 --> 01:09:08,581
I'll finish with her.

588
01:09:11,264 --> 01:09:12,663

Here, Twinny, get him some water.

Good night. God bless.

- You've had worse.

That was superb, that, Ian, mate.

611
01:14:59,064 --> 01:15:00,816
You played a fuckin' blinder.

612
01:15:00,984 --> 01:15:02,622
Who won the fight, Ian or Ian?

613
01:15:02,784 --> 01:15:04,502
It's like Ian knocked Ian out to me.

614
01:15:04,664 --> 01:15:06,939
Twatted himself
with a right good uppercut.

615
01:15:10,864 --> 01:15:13,981
- Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant.
- Girls, girls, not now.

616
01:15:14,144 --> 01:15:16,419
Hang on. Come with me.
Come with the Hookster.

01:15:26,344 --> 01:15:28,733

01:15:40,864 --> 01:15:42,422
For what it's worth.

621
01:15:44,264 --> 01:15:46,334
Chin up. Could be worse.

622
01:15:46,504 --> 01:15:48,460
Could be the lead singer in The Fall.

623
01:16:06,344 --> 01:16:07,618
Ian.

624
01:16:07,784 --> 01:16:10,503
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

625
01:16:14,864 --> 01:16:17,742
- I'm so sorry.
- I had a fit.

Ian, you are so depressing.

631
01:17:43,104 --> 01:17:45,334
I'm so happy to sit with you here.

632
01:17:49,344 --> 01:17:50,538
Me too.

633
01:18:01,184 --> 01:18:02,822
I don't know what to say.

634
01:18:08,344 --> 01:18:10,653
I never felt this way before.

635
01:18:15,584 --> 01:18:17,495
But...

636
01:18:17,664 --> 01:18:20,224
...at the same time I feel like

637
01:18:20,384 --> 01:18:23,342
I don't really know
anything about you, and...

638
01:18:25,344 --> 01:18:27,460
...you don't know me, and...

639
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:35,256
Well, what do you want to know?

640
01:18:43,104 --> 01:18:45,140
Tell me your favourite movie.

641
01:18:46,104 --> 01:18:47,332
Hmm...

642
01:18:49,664 --> 01:18:54,215
<i>I really like... The Sound of Music.</i>

- Nothing.

644
01:19:03,504 --> 01:19:06,735
- Anything else?
- Your favourite colour.

645
01:19:06,904 --> 01:19:08,974
Mine is purple.

646
01:19:10,184 --> 01:19:13,335
Blue. Man City blue.

647
01:19:15,024 --> 01:19:16,776
What is Man City blue?

648
01:19:18,184 --> 01:19:20,652
Well, Man City is a football club.

649
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:23,423
And they wear blue.

650
01:19:37,704 --> 01:19:40,172
- Ian...
- Hmm?

651
01:19:45,424 --> 01:19:47,415
I'm a little scared.

652
01:19:49,424 --> 01:19:50,652
Scared of what?

653
01:19:54,024 --> 01:19:56,174
Scared of falling in love with you.

654
01:20:51,584 --> 01:20:53,222
Hiya.

655
01:20:55,024 --> 01:20:56,821
I'm so glad you're home.

656
01:20:58,184 --> 01:20:59,822
I'll make you a cup of tea.

657
01:22:06,504 --> 01:22:08,574
I don't want to hurt you, Debbie.

658
01:22:13,704 --> 01:22:15,023
Ian?

659
01:22:17,944 --> 01:22:19,297
Come to bed, eh?

660
01:22:22,904 --> 01:22:26,738
- Taken my pills.
- Ian?

661
01:22:44,184 --> 01:22:45,856

663
01:23:35,784 --> 01:23:39,254
Mr Curtis, I am here to tell you
that you are well enough to leave,

664
01:23:39,424 --> 01:23:41,858
but you must get some rest
for several days.

665
01:23:42,024 --> 01:23:45,460
Just be aware that your condition
is extremely weak at the moment.

666
01:23:46,344 --> 01:23:48,539
But I am discharging you.

667
01:23:48,704 --> 01:23:50,103
Thank you.

668
01:23:56,704 --> 01:23:58,103
Well, that's that, then.

01:24:21,864 --> 01:24:23,582
<i>And how it affects me.</i>

676
01:24:24,504 --> 01:24:26,495
Panic's over. He's here.

677
01:24:27,864 --> 01:24:29,263
<i>Now they want more.</i>

678
01:24:29,424 --> 01:24:32,416
<i>- They expect me to give more.
- Just enjoy yourself.</i>

679
01:24:34,584 --> 01:24:36,336
<i>And I don't know if I can.</i>

680
01:24:39,104 --> 01:24:41,664
<i>It's like it's not happening to me,</i>

681
01:24:41,824 --> 01:24:45,533
<i>but... someone pretending to be me,</i>

You're on.

688
01:25:34,424 --> 01:25:37,575
- I need a few minutes.
- What?

689
01:25:46,784 --> 01:25:50,743
Go and get Alan from Crispy Ambulance,

I'm sorry.

691

Take as long as you need.
How long do you need?

692
01:26:09,104 --> 01:26:11,174
You know the words to our songs,
don't you?

693
01:26:11,344 --> 01:26:12,777
- Most of them. What?
- Get on.

- Serious?
- I look like I'm fucking jokin'?

696
01:26:36,144 --> 01:26:37,293
Off! Off! Off!

697
01:26:37,464 --> 01:26:39,261
Shit!

698
01:26:39,424 --> 01:26:41,335
You all right, Ian, mate?

699
01:26:46,504 --> 01:26:47,903
Ready to go on?

700
01:26:48,504 --> 01:26:51,098
Ian! Ian! Ian! Ian!

701
01:26:51,264 --> 01:26:53,494
Ian, talk to me.

702
01:26:55,704 --> 01:26:57,501
- OK.
- OK.

703
01:27:16,944 --> 01:27:19,742
- Where's my 20 quid?
- In my "fuck off" pocket.

704
01:27:52,224 --> 01:27:53,737
Twenty quid. Go on.

705
01:27:53,904 --> 01:27:55,132
I want 50.

706
01:27:56,184 --> 01:27:57,583
You fucker.

707
01:28:08,184 --> 01:28:10,140
Get Hooky off the stage now!

708
01:28:18,344 --> 01:28:20,335
Get off! Fuckin' get off!

709
01:28:21,704 --> 01:28:22,773
You, you fucker!

710
01:28:22,944 --> 01:28:24,775
Get the fuck out!

711
01:28:34,584 --> 01:28:36,302
I don't get it, Ian.

712
01:28:36,464 --> 01:28:39,217
I don't get why you're
doing this to yourself.

713
01:28:40,184 --> 01:28:42,937
- It's all coming apart.
- No, it's all coming together.

714
01:28:43,104 --> 01:28:45,902
Tonight was great.
It'll go down in history.

715
01:28:48,104 --> 01:28:50,664
You remember Lou Reed
at the Free Trade Hall?

716
01:28:51,264 --> 01:28:53,459
- The riot?
- That's right, the fuckin' riot.

717
01:28:53,624 --> 01:28:55,182
Best gig I've ever been to.

718
01:28:58,704 --> 01:29:01,423
It all used to be so simple,
everything.

719
01:29:02,784 --> 01:29:05,776
Now everyone hates me.
I've made everyone hate me.

720
01:29:05,944 --> 01:29:07,343
No one hates you.

721
01:29:07,504 --> 01:29:09,938
- Even the people who love me hate me.
- Debbie?

722
01:29:10,104 --> 01:29:12,299
- And Natalie.
- How can Natalie hate you?

723
01:29:12,464 --> 01:29:16,093
- For Christ's sake.
- She will, though. I know she will.

724
01:29:16,944 --> 01:29:18,343
You're a good dad, Ian.

725
01:29:18,504 --> 01:29:21,735
No, Tony, I'm not. I know I'm not.

726
01:29:21,904 --> 01:29:25,943
If I was a good dad,
then I wouldn't be doing all... this.

727
01:29:28,184 --> 01:29:32,257
And what about Annik?
She loves you. You love her.

728
01:29:35,184 --> 01:29:37,493
- I hate her.
- And you love her.

729
01:29:42,184 --> 01:29:44,220
You can't pin all that on us.

730
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:46,534
We didn't start the fuckin' riot.

731
01:29:49,264 --> 01:29:51,653
Mate, you're pissing up
the wrong tree here.

732
01:29:51,824 --> 01:29:54,463
You think I owe you money
for the damages? Guess what?

733
01:29:54,624 --> 01:29:57,184
I don't. So shut the fuck up
and start suing,

734
01:29:57,344 --> 01:30:00,700
'cause that's the only way you're
gonna get a fuckin' bean out of me.

735
01:30:01,704 --> 01:30:03,262
Wanker.

736
01:30:03,864 --> 01:30:06,856
Who the fuck...?

737
01:30:10,704 --> 01:30:13,172
<i>- Hello.
- It's Ian.</i>

738
01:30:22,344 --> 01:30:25,575
Oh, fuckin' shine a light!
Aren't you in enough trouble?

739
01:30:28,784 --> 01:30:31,093
- We need somewhere to stay.
- Try a hotel.

740
01:30:31,264 --> 01:30:34,381
I'm skint, and you still
owe me some money.

741
01:30:34,544 --> 01:30:38,014
Fuckin' hell! Have I got Barclays
tattooed on my forehead?

742
01:30:39,264 --> 01:30:40,413
Get in.

743
01:30:48,664 --> 01:30:50,575
Tea's in the pot, bedroom's in there.

744
01:30:50,744 --> 01:30:52,416
Spare noddys in the drawer.

745
01:30:52,584 --> 01:30:53,778
Is this a bad time?

746
01:30:53,944 --> 01:30:56,504
No! I'm just in the mood
for a desperate social call

747
01:30:56,664 --> 01:30:59,417
from you and Joan of Arc.

748
01:31:00,944 --> 01:31:02,343
Yes?

749
01:31:03,584 --> 01:31:05,495
Debbie! Great!

750
01:31:05,664 --> 01:31:09,452
And what the fuck can I do for you?
Need some money, a place to crash?

751
01:31:09,624 --> 01:31:11,694
Fuckin' light bulb need changin'?

752
01:31:13,784 --> 01:31:15,502
And you don't know where he is.

753
01:31:16,184 --> 01:31:17,537
<i>Quelle surprise.</i>

754
01:31:20,264 --> 01:31:22,255
Something about Derby?

755
01:31:23,024 --> 01:31:26,016
Well, it's nice to know you two
are talking properly again.

756
01:31:27,864 --> 01:31:30,332
Listen, Debbie,
I don't know where the fuck he is.

757
01:31:30,504 --> 01:31:32,540
As usual, I know fuck all.

758
01:31:33,784 --> 01:31:34,933
Don't I?

759
01:31:37,184 --> 01:31:38,856
Don't I?

760
01:31:39,024 --> 01:31:42,460
Rob, who are you talking to?

761
01:31:50,504 --> 01:31:51,778
Ian.

762
01:31:53,264 --> 01:31:54,902
What, he's there with you?

763
01:31:59,024 --> 01:32:00,742
Is she with him?

764
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:08,576
Yeah. We're all here.
One big fuckin' happy family.

765
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:17,661
She wants a divorce.

766
01:32:26,264 --> 01:32:27,777
You can sleep here.

767
01:32:32,184 --> 01:32:34,175
Stay as long as you like, Ian.

768
01:32:41,024 --> 01:32:43,413
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

769
01:33:06,704 --> 01:33:10,299
Ian? I've got an idea.

770
01:33:12,704 --> 01:33:15,662
I've been studying hypnosis.

771
01:33:43,504 --> 01:33:44,732
<i>Ian?</i>

772
01:33:45,864 --> 01:33:47,855
<i>Let me in, love.</i>

773
01:33:49,384 --> 01:33:51,215
<i>Just want to talk.</i>

774
01:33:51,384 --> 01:33:55,582
<i>You're mine. Irretrievably.</i>

775
01:33:56,784 --> 01:33:58,661
<i>I'm a little scared.</i>

776
01:34:00,104 --> 01:34:02,334
<i>Scared of falling in love with you.</i>

777
01:34:02,864 --> 01:34:04,695
<i>This has to be for good.</i>

778
01:34:05,664 --> 01:34:07,655
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

779
01:34:08,944 --> 01:34:12,380
<i>I owe you everything.
I love you.</i>

780
01:34:12,544 --> 01:34:14,535
<i>What does that mean?</i>

781
01:34:16,264 --> 01:34:18,494
<i>I've never felt this way before.</i>

782
01:34:18,664 --> 01:34:20,336
<i>So it was my life began...</i>

783
01:34:20,504 --> 01:34:23,701
<i>- I don't deserve this.
- So is it now I am a man</i>

784
01:34:23,864 --> 01:34:25,217
<i>I didn't do enough.</i>

785
01:34:25,384 --> 01:34:27,898
<i>So it be you and I shall grow old</i>

786
01:34:28,064 --> 01:34:29,577
<i>I should have tried harder.</i>

787
01:34:29,744 --> 01:34:30,893
<i>Or let me die</i>

788
01:34:33,424 --> 01:34:36,018
<i>And I could wish my days to be</i>

789
01:34:36,784 --> 01:34:38,775
<i>Bound each to each</i>

790
01:34:38,944 --> 01:34:40,935
<i>By natural...</i>

791
01:34:51,184 --> 01:34:52,822
Hi.

792
01:34:52,984 --> 01:34:54,417
Hi.

793
01:34:56,024 --> 01:34:57,343
I miss you.

794
01:34:59,344 --> 01:35:02,495
<i>- Is everything all right?
- I don't know, Annik.</i>

795
01:35:02,664 --> 01:35:03,938
I don't know.

796
01:35:05,344 --> 01:35:07,335
<i>It all feels wrong.</i>

797
01:35:11,424 --> 01:35:14,177
Ian, you are confusing me.

798
01:35:16,704 --> 01:35:20,333
I know. I know I am.

799
01:35:27,024 --> 01:35:28,662
<i>Dear Annik,</i>

800
01:35:30,024 --> 01:35:33,255
<i>I know I'm intruding on your life,
not you on mine.</i>

801
01:35:34,024 --> 01:35:37,096
<i>I felt as if things were becoming
a bit clearer earlier on,</i>

802
01:35:37,264 --> 01:35:40,859
<i>but can now see everything
falling to pieces before my eyes.</i>

803
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,857
<i>I'm paying dearly for past mistakes.</i>

804
01:35:46,024 --> 01:35:48,697
<i>I never realised how
one mistake in my life</i>

805
01:35:48,864 --> 01:35:52,493
<i>some four or five years ago
would make me feel how I do.</i>

806
01:35:55,624 --> 01:35:58,855
<i>I struggle between what I know
is right in my own mind,</i>

807
01:35:59,024 --> 01:36:03,017
<i>and some warped truthfulness
as seen through other people's eyes</i>

808
01:36:03,184 --> 01:36:06,301
<i>who have no heart, and
can't see the difference anyway.</i>

809
01:36:06,464 --> 01:36:08,056
Eh-up, you.

810
01:36:10,504 --> 01:36:11,653
Come on in.

811
01:36:11,824 --> 01:36:13,815
<i>I saw Apocalypse Now at the cinema.</i>

812
01:36:13,984 --> 01:36:16,179
<i>I couldn't take me eyes
away from the screen.</i>

813
01:36:16,344 --> 01:36:18,016
What you been up to, then, eh?

814
01:36:18,184 --> 01:36:21,574
<i>On the record, there's Marlon Brando
reading The Hollow Men,</i>

815
01:36:21,744 --> 01:36:26,693
<i>the struggle between man's conscience
and his heart until things go too far,</i>

816
01:36:26,864 --> 01:36:29,583
<i>get out of hand,
and can never be repaired.</i>

817
01:36:32,864 --> 01:36:35,332
<i>Is everything so worthless in the end?</i>

818
01:36:35,504 --> 01:36:37,381
<i>Is there any more?</i>

819
01:36:37,544 --> 01:36:40,342
<i>What lies beyond?
What is left to carry on?</i>

820
01:36:40,504 --> 01:36:45,453
Ian, your room's still here.
You know that, don't you?

821
01:36:45,624 --> 01:36:47,103
I know, Mum.

822
01:36:49,424 --> 01:36:50,573
Thanks.

823
01:36:57,424 --> 01:37:00,621
<i>I have the feeling
the epileptic condition will worsen.</i>

824
01:37:00,784 --> 01:37:02,661
<i>It frightens me.</i>

825
01:37:04,944 --> 01:37:08,016
<i>It's a lie to say
"I'm not afraid any more".</i>

826
01:37:08,784 --> 01:37:11,582
<i>There's nothing the doctors can do
but try tablets.</i>

827
01:37:13,024 --> 01:37:14,582
<i>I felt I had to tell you this</i>

828
01:37:14,744 --> 01:37:17,417
<i>even though it might change
your feelings for me.</i>

829
01:37:18,344 --> 01:37:22,417
<i>I've been thinking of you constantly,
trying to rationalise our situation,</i>

830
01:37:22,584 --> 01:37:24,700
<i>thinking of the things we've done.</i>

831
01:37:24,864 --> 01:37:27,332
<i>Images and thoughts prey on my mind,</i>

832
01:37:27,504 --> 01:37:30,098
<i>before my eyes all times
of the day and night.</i>

833
01:37:31,184 --> 01:37:33,903
<i>And while some things are beyond
my understanding,</i>

834
01:37:34,064 --> 01:37:36,942
<i>I know that I love you
and will do forever.</i>

835
01:37:38,584 --> 01:37:42,133
<i>Until I see you again,
I miss you with all my heart.</i>

836
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:46,016
<i>All my love... Ian.</i>

837
01:38:15,024 --> 01:38:17,413
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.</i>

838
01:38:17,584 --> 01:38:20,860
<i>- You all right?
- I'm not coming out tonight.</i>

839
01:38:21,024 --> 01:38:22,343
<i>Why not?</i>

840
01:38:23,344 --> 01:38:25,653
I'm gonna go home. Speak to Debbie.

841
01:38:25,824 --> 01:38:27,701
<i>Does she want to speak to you?</i>

842
01:38:28,344 --> 01:38:31,939
Dunno. I just feel
the need to speak to her.

843
01:38:32,104 --> 01:38:33,776
<i>Well, if you're sure.</i>

844
01:38:33,944 --> 01:38:36,333
I'll see you Monday morning
at the airport.

845
01:38:36,504 --> 01:38:39,018
<i>- You all ready and packed?
- Not yet.</i>

846
01:38:39,184 --> 01:38:41,903
<i>I'm not gonna sleep tonight.
I'm like a fuckin' kid.</i>

847
01:38:42,064 --> 01:38:43,895
Yeah. Same here.

848
01:38:44,064 --> 01:38:47,022
<i>I've got all my clothes laid out
on my bed and everything.</i>

849
01:38:49,344 --> 01:38:52,177
<i>- I'll see you Monday.
- Don't be late.</i>

850
01:38:52,344 --> 01:38:54,812
Don't worry. I'll be there.

851
01:39:08,864 --> 01:39:10,263
I'm off.

852
01:39:10,864 --> 01:39:13,173
I'm gonna go meet up
with Debbie tonight.

853
01:39:38,864 --> 01:39:42,140
<i>Could we have your attention
please, ladies and gentlemen?</i>

854
01:39:42,304 --> 01:39:45,421
<i>We are ready to begin now
the sale on behalf of our bank</i>

855
01:39:45,584 --> 01:39:48,496
<i>to disperse the repossessed property</i>

856
01:39:48,664 --> 01:39:50,814
<i>formerly owned by a Mr Stroszek.</i>

857
01:39:50,984 --> 01:39:53,418
<i>Colonel Ralph Wade
will be our auctioneer.</i>

858
01:39:53,584 --> 01:39:57,259
<i>I'll be serving as your clerk.
We're ready to begin with the auction.</i>

859
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:21,262
<i>Whoa!</i>

860
01:41:30,864 --> 01:41:33,014
What are you doing here?

861
01:41:34,504 --> 01:41:36,574
Don't divorce me, Debbie.

862
01:41:38,584 --> 01:41:40,097
I don't want to lose you.

863
01:41:42,424 --> 01:41:44,654
It's not that simple, though,
is it, Ian?

864
01:41:46,504 --> 01:41:48,495
Is this really what you want?

865
01:41:48,664 --> 01:41:52,373
No. No, I don't.

866
01:41:55,104 --> 01:41:57,095
But you love someone else.

867
01:42:01,664 --> 01:42:03,894
What's that got to do with us?

868
01:42:05,184 --> 01:42:06,503
Everything.

869
01:42:12,424 --> 01:42:14,380
You can't leave her, can you?

870
01:42:17,024 --> 01:42:18,696
It's not that easy.

871
01:42:19,584 --> 01:42:22,462
I've tried. She won't go away.

872
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:29,700
Well, then you've made your decision.

873
01:42:34,024 --> 01:42:35,218
Go on then.

874
01:42:35,384 --> 01:42:38,376
- What?
- Go on, leave me alone!

875
01:42:38,544 --> 01:42:39,533
Ian.

876
01:42:39,704 --> 01:42:42,537
Don't come back until the morning.
I'll be gone by then.

877
01:42:43,504 --> 01:42:44,903
Get out!

878
01:44:32,104 --> 01:44:34,095
<i>So this is permanence</i>

879
01:44:35,344 --> 01:44:37,494
<i>Love shattered pride</i>

880
01:44:39,024 --> 01:44:40,901
<i>What once was innocence</i>

881
01:44:41,064 --> 01:44:43,453
<i>Turned on its side</i>

882
01:44:45,424 --> 01:44:47,574
<i>A cloud hangs over me</i>

883
01:44:47,744 --> 01:44:49,939
<i>Marks every move</i>

884
01:44:51,784 --> 01:44:54,617
<i>Deep in the memory of what once was love</i>

885
01:48:34,504 --> 01:48:37,382
I'll be back in a minute.

886
01:48:37,544 --> 01:48:39,023
One minute.

887
01:49:01,184 --> 01:49:02,981
No!

888
01:49:06,104 --> 01:49:07,662
No!

889
01:50:06,144 --> 01:50:09,136
Can someone help me?

890
01:50:10,264 --> 01:50:12,255
Anybody, please?

891
01:50:14,104 --> 01:50:15,696
Can someone help me?
