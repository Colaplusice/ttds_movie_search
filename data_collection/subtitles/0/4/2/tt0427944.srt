4
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,190
Robin Williger.

5
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,892
He is a 1 5-year-old freshman
from Raci ne, Wisconsin.

6
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,696
He enjoys studying history.

7
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,429
He's on the debate team.

8
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,803
Robin's future looked
very, very bright,

9
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,739
but recently he was
diagnosed with cancer,

10
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,401
a very tough kind of cancer.

11
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,072
Robin tells me he has
quit smoking, though,

12
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,413
and he no longer thinks
that cigarettes are cool.

13
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,986
( applause )

14
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,854
Whoo!.

15
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,223
And our final guest today
is Nick Naylor.

16
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,890
Mr. Naylor is the vice president
ofthe Academy ofTobacco Studies.

17
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,025
Now, they are the tobacco
industry's main lobby

18
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,433
in Washington, D.C.

19
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,597
and Mr. Naylor is
their chiefspokesman.

20
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,938
( audience murmuring )

21
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,986
( booing, hissing )

22
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,389
NICK:
Fewpeople on this planet know

23
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,620
what it is to be truly despised.

24
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,959
Can you blame them?

25
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,431
I earn a living
fronting an organization

26
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,799
that kills 1,200 human beings a day.

27
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,098
1,200 people.

28
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,696
We 're talking
two jumbo jet plane loads

29
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,504
ofmen, women and children.

30
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,635
I mean, there 's Attila,

31
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,269
Genghis,

32
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,278
and me,

33
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,643
Nick Naylor,

34
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,773
the face ofcigarettes...

35
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,647
the Colonel Sanders ofnicotine.

36
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,220
This is where I work,

37
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,846
the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

38
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,118
It was established
by seven gentlemen

39
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,818
you may recognize from C-SPAN.

40
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,556
These guys realized quick
ifthey were going to claim

41
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,756
that cigarettes were not addictive,

42
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,026
they better have proof.

43
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,965
This is the man they rely on,

44
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,196
Erhardt Von Grupten Mundt.

45
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,569
They found him in Germany.

46
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,198
I won 't go into the details.

47
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,469
He 's been testing the link

48
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,805
between nicotine
and lung cancer

49
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,176
for 30 years and hasn 't found
any conclusive results.

50
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,180
The man 's a genius.

51
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,944
He could disprove gravity.

52
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,712
Then we 've got our sharks.

53
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,582
We draft them out
oflvy League law schools

54
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,986
and give them time-shares
and sports cars.

55
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,648
It's just like
a John Grisham novel-

56
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,319
you know, without all the espionage.

57
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,659
Most importantly,
we 've got spin control.

58
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,596
That's where I come in.

59
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,065
I get paid to talk.

60
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,726
I don 't have an MD or law degree.

61
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:04,734
( shutter clicking )

62
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,065
( machine gun firing )

63
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,335
I have a bachelor's in
kicking ass and taking names.

64
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,876
You know that guy
who can pick up any girl?

65
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,036
I'm him

66
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,238
on crack.

67
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,441
( cheers, applause )

68
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,541
This is obviously a heated issue

69
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,348
and we do have a lot
that we want to cover today.

70
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,551
Nick, do you have a question?.

71
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,749
Joan,

72
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:29,658
how on earth would
Big Tobacco profit

73
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,196
off ofthe loss ofthis young man?.

74
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,493
Now, I hate to think
in such callous terms,

75
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,694
but, ifanything,
we'd be losing a customer.

76
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,898
It's not only our hope,
it's in our best interest

77
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,237
to keep Robin alive and smoking.

78
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,004
- That's ludicrous.
- Let me tell you something,

79
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,942
Joan, and please,
let me share something

80
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:50,675
with the fine, concerned
people in the audience today.

81
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,344
The Ron Goodes ofthis world...

82
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:57,014
want the Robin Willigers to die.

83
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,215
- What?.
- NAYLOR: You know why?.

84
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,916
So that their budgets will go up.

85
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,893
This is nothing less than
trafficking in human misery,

86
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,758
and you, sir, ought
to be ashamed ofyourself.

87
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,354
I ought to be ashamed of myself?.

88
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,594
As a matter offact,
we're about to launch...

89
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,694
a $50 million campaign

90
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:16,969
aimed at persuading kids
not to smoke.

91
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,237
Because I think
that we can all agree

92
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,472
that there is nothing
more important

93
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,912
than America's children.

94
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,380
LUNDEN: All right, now,
that's something that

95
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,247
we're going towant
to know more about.

96
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,512
but I have to take a short break.

97
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,713
Hang on, a lot more coming.

98
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,586
( applause )

99
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,627
$50 million??!. Areyou
out ofyour fucking mind??!.

100
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,626
Everyone has a boss.

101
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,627
BRjust happens

102
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,254
to be mine.

103
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,230
He came from the vending
machine world.

104
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,995
This made him tough.

105
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,567
The name BR came
from his tour in Vietnam.

106
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,767
The people who know
its meaning are all dead.

107
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,310
The deal was five m i I l ion!

108
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,176
$ 5 m i I l ion wi I l get you
a couple of subway posters.

109
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,213
I t's not going to impress anyone.

110
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,475
That's the idea, Nick.

111
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,515
You'll be thanking me soon.

112
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,778
This'll probably getyou great press.

113
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,252
I gotta call the captain
and see ifthis is gonna fly.

114
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,448
Getyour ass back to D.C.

115
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,625
( applause nearby)

116
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,895
( door opening )

117
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,239
Thankyou so much for coming.

118
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:22,972
Mr. Naylor?.

119
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,064
It's your turn.

120
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,509
Ah.

121
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,671
Joey is such a bright young man.

122
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,748
We all look forward

123
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,612
to his coming out
ofhis shell a little.

124
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,945
He's a bit shy.

125
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,849
Yeah, he gets that from his mother.

126
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,760
( whisper): Hey,Joey.

127
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,232
Please don't ruin my childhood.

128
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,394
Come on,Joey. Trust me.

129
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,372
How many ofyou want to be
lawyers when you grow up?.

130
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,471
Right.

131
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,073
How about...

132
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,913
movie stars?.

133
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,247
( laughing )

134
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,480
How about lobbyists?.

135
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,521
What's that?.

136
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,557
It's kind oflike being a movie star.

137
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,421
It's what I do.
I talk for a living.

138
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,687
What doyou talk about?.

139
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,854
I speak on behalf of cigarettes.

140
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,192
My mom used to smoke.

141
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,926
She says that cigarettes kill.

142
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,434
Really?. Now, is your mommy a doctor?.

143
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,435
No.

144
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,267
A scientific researcher of some kind?.

145
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,601
No.

146
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,640
Well, she doesn't exactly sound

147
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,141
Iike a credible expert,
now, does she?.

148
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,576
Don't feel bad.

149
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,579
It's okay to listen toyour mom.

150
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,047
I mean, it's good to listen
toyour parents...Joey.

151
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,448
All I'm suggesting

152
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,953
is that there will always
be people trying to tell you

153
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,216
what to do and what to think.

154
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,689
There probably already are
people doing that.

155
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:47,690
Am I right?.

156
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:48,725
KI DS: Yes.

157
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,591
I'm here to say

158
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:54,132
that when someone tries to act
like some sort of an expert,

159
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,725
you can respond, "Who says??"

160
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,532
So, cigarettes are good foryou?.

161
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,539
- No!
- No, that's not...

162
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,801
That's not what I'm getting at.

163
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,241
My point is that you have
to think foryourself.

164
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,073
You have to challenge authority.

165
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,443
Ifyour parents told you
that chocolate was dangerous,

166
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,073
would you just take theirword for it?.

167
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,275
KI DS: No.

168
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,374
Exactly.

169
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,317
So perhaps instead of acting
like sheep

170
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,388
when it comes to cigarettes,

171
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,922
you should find out foryourself.

172
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,150
Okay, then.

173
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,624
Thankyou, Mr. Naylor,
forjoining us.

174
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,955
( light applause )

175
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,663
NICK:
Everyweek we meet here at Bert's.

176
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,764
Together, we represent
the chiefspokespeople

177
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,844
for the tobacco, alcohol and
firearms industries.

178
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,071
We call ourselves the MD Squad.

179
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,077
Al I ri ght.

180
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,842
M--D, Merchants ofDeath.

181
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,110
So, my day's rui ned.

182
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,115
Why?.

00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,446
Dateline's doi ng a segment

184
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,145
on fetal alcohol syndrome.
Thank you.

185
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,189
Polly works
for the Moderation Council.

186
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,588
A casual drinker
by the age of 14,

187
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:54,955
Polly quickly developed

188
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,462
a tolerance usually reserved
for lrish dockworkers.

189
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,395
In our world, she 's the woman

190
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,660
that got the pope
to endorse red wine.

191
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,570
We' re gonna get creamed.

192
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:07,934
Any ideas?.

193
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,337
I don't know.

194
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,774
Deformed kids are tough.

195
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,141
I 'm lucky my product only makes
them bald before it kills them.

196
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,146
You could hug the kids.

197
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,216
They're not going
to let me hug the kids.

198
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,875
Who's doing the segment,
Donaldson or Sawyer?.

199
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:20,884
Sawyer, probably.

200
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:21,885
You're fucked.

201
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:22,886
Why?.

202
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,115
Cause she's gonna hug them.

203
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,418
Look, ifyou see her going in
for a hug,

204
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,358
maybe just box her out,
get in there before she does.

205
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,054

BobbyJayworks forSAFETY,

206
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,393
- ( ricochet )
- the Societyforthe Advancement ofFirearms

207
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,296
and Effective Training for Youth.

208
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,699
You want me to smile?.

209
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,872
After watching the footage
ofthe Kent State shootings,

210
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,807
BobbyJay, then 1 7, signed up
for the National Guard

211
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,003
so he, too, could shoot
college students.

212
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,581
But the National Guard
recruiter was out to lunch,

213
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,845
so BobbyJay ended up
shooting Panamanians instead,

214
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,613
which was almost as good
as college students.

215
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,744
( gunshot )

216
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,652
nly they shoot back.

217
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,418
You know, you can beat
a Breathalyzer

218
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,517
- by sucki ng on activated charcoal tablets?.
- Really?.

219
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,186
Maybe we should change
our campaign to

220
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,264
"IfYou Must Drink and Drive,
Suck Charcoal."

221
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,423
Yeah, but don't the police wonder

222
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,431
whyyou're sucking on charcoal?.

223
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,331
There's no law against charcoal.

224
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,926
- Yet.
- Yet.

225
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,801
Dad, why is the American
government the best government?.

226
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,436
Because of our
endless appeals system.

227
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,075
Joe, you're not writing down
what I just said areyou?.

228
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,346
Mm-hmm.

229
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,445
Joey, stop for a second.

230
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,046
What is the subject ofyour essay?.

231
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,956
Why is American government
the best government in the world.

232
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,688
Your teacher crafted that question?.

233
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,559
Yeah. Why?.

234
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,462
Well... I'll look past
the obvious problems

235
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,864
in syntax for a moment,

236
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,061
and I'll focus more on the core
ofthe question.

237
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,365
I mean, "A,"

238
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,100
does America have
the best government in the world?.

239
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,869
And "B," what constitutes
a "best government"?.

240
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,410
Is it crime, is it poverty, literacy?.

241
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:54,945
Hmm?.

242
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:55,979
And America- definitely not best.

243
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,276
Perhaps not even better than most.

244
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,748
We do have a very
entertaining government...

245
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,148
Dad.

246
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,083
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,823
Are you familiarwith the term "B.S."?.

248
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,483
Bullshit.

249
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:08,855
Yes, exactly.

250
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,862
B.S., if I may, is what
questions like the one

251
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,864
your teacher posed are made for.

252
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,900
Because even if America
had the best government,

253
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,525
there'd be no way to prove it.

254
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:18,967
And how many pages are you writing?.

255
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,969
Two pages.

256
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,664
Two pages...

257
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,332
Definitely not in two pages.

258
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,603
So what am I supposed to write?.

259
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,406
You can write whateveryou want.

260
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,912
Okay.

261
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,003
Write about...

262
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,516
write about America's
amazing ability

263
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,610
to make profit by breaking down
trading tariffs

264
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:38,087
and bringing American jobs
to Third World countries.

265
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,124
Or how good we are
at executing felons.

266
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,853
They're all correct answers.

267
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,929
I can do that?.

268
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,553
See,Joey, that's the beauty
of argument.

269
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,064
'Cause ifyou argue correctly,
you're neverwrong.

270
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,676
Dad, if I finish
this essaywithin an hour,

271
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,541
can we stay up all night?.

272
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:05,310
That's a negotiation,
not an argument.

273
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,147
( over TV):
Well, Conway, seeyou made it.

274
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,279
Yeah, I guess that little
voice was wrong.

275
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,481
I feel better.

276
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,750
I feel a lot better, too.

277
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,418
As a matter offact, I never
felt so good in my life.

278
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,120
How about a cigarette?.

279
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,696
( gunshot )

280
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,663
( dramatic music playing )

281
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,531
( gunfire )

282
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,071
MAN 1 : Is he...?.

283
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,273
MAN 2: Yeah.

284
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,820
Hey.

285
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,357
Nick, you still own a watch, don't you?.

286
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,651
J ill, I can't help feeling

287
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,283
Joey's getting the wrong idea
about his dad.

288
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,918
It would be great ifl could spend

289
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,553
a little more timewith him,
you know?.

290
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,156
To give him a fair
and balanced perspective.

291
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,132
Nick, you had plenty
oftime forthat.

292
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,703
Nowyou're his weekend guardian.

293
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,829
Besides, he has Brad.

294
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,032
He still needs his father.

295
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,336
Nick.

296
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,535
You have a second?.

297
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,577
Sure, Brad.

298
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,447
Nick, yourjob
and everything aside,

299
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,485
I hopeyou understand
that secondhand smoke's

300
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,282
a real killer.

301
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,253
What areyou talking about?.

302
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,984
I just hopeyou're providing

303
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,652
a smoke-free environment
forJoey, that's all I'm saying.

304
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,956
Brad, I'm his father.

305
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,396
You're the guy fucking his mom.

306
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,100
That was unnecessary.

307
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,707
Thankyou all.
Thankyou all for coming.

308
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,276
Tobacco is winning thewar.

309
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,574
Thewar against our children.

310
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,979
They like to use cartoons
and symbols to hook our kids.

311
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,951
Well, nowwe have
a symbol of our own.

312
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,248
Doctor.

313
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,120
It is my hope that
within theyear

314
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,920
every cigarette package

315
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:58,053
sold in America
will carry this symbol.

316
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,393
Perhaps then, cigarettes
will finally be labeled

317
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,593
appropriately as poison.

318
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,567
I will be holding
a congressional hearing

319
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,401
to discuss the inclusion
ofthe skull and crossbones

320
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,974
in the next two weeks.

321
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,474
As usual, I extend
an open invitation

322
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,068
to big tobacco.

323
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:18,172
Perhaps this time theywill
grace us with their presence.

324
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,581
And their answers.

325
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,084
Thankyou very much.

326
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,313
( reporters clamoring )

327
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:29,227
People, what is going on out there?.

328
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,957
I look down this table,
all I see are white flags.

329
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,693
Our numbers are down
all across the board.

330
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,666
Teen smoking-
our bread and butter,

331
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,499
is falling like a shit from heaven.

332
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,301
We don't sell TicTacs,
for Christ's sake.

333
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,070
We sell cigarettes.

334
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:49,113
And they're cool and available
and addictive.

335
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,841
The job is almost done for us.

336
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:57,521
This environmentalist
is challenging us.

337
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,183
We have to have an answer.

338
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,987
I'm asking you,

339
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,925
when this cocksucker puts
Captain Hook on our products,

340
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,553
what the fuck are we going to do?.

341
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,224
- BR.
- Yeah, Nick.

342
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,528
Ifl may.

343
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,069
In 1 91 0,

344
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,662
the U.S. was producing
ten billion cigarettes a year.

345
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:15,899
By 1 930,

346
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,976
we were up to 1 23 billion.

347
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,045
What happened in between?.

348
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,806
Three things.

349
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:22,881
Aworld war,

350
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,850
dieting... and movies.

351
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,180
Movies?.

352
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,313
1 927- talking pictures are born.

353
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,653
Suddenly, directors need to give
their actors

354
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,693
something to do
while they're talking.

355
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,490
Cary Grant, Carole Lombard
are lighting up.

356
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,064
Bette Davis- a chimney.

357
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,462
And Bogart-
remember the first picture

358
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,625
with him and Lauren Bacall?.

359
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,203
Well, yea... not specifically.

360
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,566
Oh, she sort

361
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,765
of shimmies in
through the doorway,

362
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,967
1 9 years old.

363
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,543
Pure sex.

364
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:53,542
She says,

365
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,875
"Anyone got a match??"

366
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,676
And Bogie throws
the matches at her...

367
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,084
and she catches them.

368
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,747
Greatest romance ofthe century.

369
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,018
How'd it start?.
Lighting a cigarette.

370
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,594
These days when someone
smokes in the movies,

371
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,926
they're either a psychopath
or a European.

372
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,932
The message Hollywood
needs to send out

373
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,002
is smoking is cool.

374
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,400
We need the cast of Willand Grace

375
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,870
smoking in their living room.

376
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,203
Forrest Gump puffing away
between his box of chocolates.

377
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,709
Hugh Grant earning back
the love ofJulia Roberts

378
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:31,112
by buying her favorite brand-
herVirginia Slims.

379
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,743
Most ofthe actors smoke already.

380
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,083
Ifthey start doing it on-screen,

381
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,885
we can put the sex
back into cigarettes.

382
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,552
Well, it's a thought.

383
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,458
I was hoping for something
a little more inspiring,

384
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,587
but at leastyou're thinking.

385
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,062
Rest ofyou people,
slam yourfucking brains

386
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,064
againstyour desks

387
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,761
until something useful comes out.

388
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,769
Thatwas awesome.

389
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:53,895
Thankyou.

390
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,997
Nick, you've been summoned.

391
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,097
Captain wants to seeyou.

392
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,540
He saw the Joan show.

393
00:17:58,644 --> 00:17:59,736
What'd he think?.

394
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,642
Getyour ass on the next flight
to Winston-Salem.

395
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,118
Mostpeople have this image
in theirheads

396
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,312
oftobacco executives
jet-setting around the world

397
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,616
on private planes,
eating foie gras

398
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,088
as they count their money.

399
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,319
Not me.

400
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,725
I like to ride with the people.

401
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,354
Knowyour clients.

402
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,660
My people cram themselves
into a tiny seat,

403
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,632
pop a Xanax and dream
ofthe moment

404
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,670
they can stufftheir face
with fresh tobacco.

405
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,536
Ifl can convince just one of
these kids to pick up smoking,

406
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,905
I've paid for my flight- round-trip.

407
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:44,152
The Captain is the last great
man oftobacco.

408
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,985
He introduced filters

409
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:49,549
when cigarettes first got
slammed by Reader's Di gest.

410
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:54,030
Later, he founded
the Academy ofTobacco Studies.

411
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,000
The club was founded
by the tobacco barons in 1 890

412
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:00,538
so they'd have a place
to get away from their wives.

413
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,502
Here, the Captain is a legend-

414
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,944
a self-made man who started
from nothing,

415
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,845
and ended up with everything...

416
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,147
except, evidently, a son.

417
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,484
N ick, my boy.

418
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,683
You're just i n ti me for m ud.

419
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,384
Thank you.

420
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,189
Sit down there. Yeah.

421
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,727
Yeah.

422
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,825
You know the secret
to a really good julep?.

423
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,631
No, sir.

424
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,104
Well, you crush the mint

425
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,301
down onto the ice with your thumb

426
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,844
and you grind it in, see?.

427
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,574
And it releases the menthol.

428
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,173
Hmm.

429
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,684
Nowyou know who taught me that?.

430
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:48,718
No, sir. Who?.

431
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,617
Fidel Castro.

432
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,186
Doyou remember 1 952?.

433
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:00,527
Well, sir, I wasn't alive in 1 952.

434
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:05,365
Good Lord, I was in Korea
shooting Chinese in 1 952.

435
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,631
Really?.

436
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,003
Todaythey're our best customer.

437
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,736
Next timewewon't have to shoot
so many ofthem, will we?.

438
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,573
- ( chuckles )
- No, sir.

439
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,673
1 952 was theyear
Reader's Digest

440
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,651
nailed us with
the whole health aspect.

441
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,244
As Churchill said,

442
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,620
that was perhaps the end
of our beginning.

443
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,058
Tell me,

444
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,096
doyou enjoyyour current work, Nick?.

445
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,164
Yes, sir.

446
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,698
It's challenging...

447
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,395
Ifyou can do tobacco,
you can do anything.

448
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,336
Yes, sir, I like that.

449
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,840
You know, Nick, you remind me

450
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,172
just a little bit
of myselfwhen I was your age.

451
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,906
Well, thankyou, sir.

452
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,845
Like thatJoan Lunden showyou did.

453
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,213
You could have given up,
cried, apologized,

454
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,307
butyou didn't.

455
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,353
You stayed loyal.

456
00:20:56,455 --> 00:21:01,324
And you gave it
to that son ofa bitch good.

457
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,986
- ( chuckles )
- My pleasure.

458
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:10,295
Now, BR's come under the idea

459
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,166
that we should start bribing
producers in Hollywood

460
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,935
to make the actors smoke on screen.

461
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,034
You know, like in the old days.

462
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,409
Say, that's, uh...

463
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,778
that's a great idea.

464
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,316
Mm-hmm.

465
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,942
Smart man, that BR.

466
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,577
Oh, yeah, yeah.

467
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,212
And loyal.

468
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:51,774
Yes, sir?.

469
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,742
Have a seat, Ron.

470
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:08,892
You, see, Ron, I can't be
everywhere I'm needed.

471
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,894
That's why I send
people likeyou

472
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,327
to speak on my behalf.

473
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:16,094
When you're there,
you're not Ron Goode,

474
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,169
the guyyour friends probably like,

475
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,830
you're Senator Finistirre's aide,

476
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,204
and your name really doesn't matter.

477
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,209
So, when

478
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,007
Ron Goode acts
like a complete asshole

479
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,810
on the Joan Lunden Show,

480
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,011
I am being an asshole
on the Joan Lunden Show.

481
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,781
Senator, sir, he sprang on me like...

482
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:40,085
Where in the hell
did you find cancer boy?.

483
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,626
He was supposed to be quite reliable.

484
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,561
The Pulmonary Council
was one ofhis references.

485
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,359
Fucking nonprofits.

486
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,833
When you're looking
for a cancer kid,

487
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,236
he should be hopeless.

488
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,898
He should have a wheelchair.

489
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,169
He should have trouble talking.

490
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:02,007
He should have
a little pet goldfish

491
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,706
he carries around
in a ziplock bag-

492
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:04,873
hopeless.

493
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,247
I apologize, sir, but ifitwasn't

494
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:08,683
- for Nick Naylor...
- Nick Naylor?.

495
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:14,958
Don'tyou even think
of using him as an excuse.

496
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,051
The man shills bullshit for a living.

497
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,130
You work for a fucking senator.

498
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,495
A senatorwho is supposed
to be tough on tobacco.

499
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,467
Have a little... pride,
for God's sake.

500
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,801
It won't happen again, sir,
I promise.

501
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,970
All right, you're excused.

502
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,183
Sometimes I feel like

503
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,983
a Colombian drug dealer.

504
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,682
( chuckles )

505
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:51,354
The other day, my own granddaughter,
flesh of flesh of my own loins,

506
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,830
asked me, "Granddaddy, is it true

507
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,800
cigarettes are bad foryou??"

508
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,765
We got to do something, Nick.

509
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,136
I thinkyou're our man.

510
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,971
Thankyou, sir.

511
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,341
I wantyou to work
on this Hollywood project.

512
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,938
Get out there the next
few weeks, stir things up

513
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,985
and report directly to me.

514
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,144
Sir, about the,

515
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:19,314
the $50 million.

516
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,325
Anti teen-smoking advertising.

517
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:25,919
Well, shit, I sure hope
it's not too persuasive.

518
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,498
( laughs )

519
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,725
I hope.

520
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,028
( laughs )

521
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,177
Nick,

522
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,144
you're family now.

523
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,876
Tobacco takes care of its own, eh?.

524
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,918
Thankyou, sir.

525
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:01,764
Mr. Naylor?.

526
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:02,856
Hi.

527
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,401
Hi. Welcome to Tobacco One.

528
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,765
Thankyou.

529
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,499
The captain told me to take
extra special care ofyou today.

530
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,041
So ifthere is anything
at all I can do

531
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,404
to makeyour flight
more pleasant,

532
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,776
you be sure and let me know now.

533
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,051
BR.

534
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,058
Pleasant flight?.

535
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,254
Oh! You could say that.

536
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,127
Came up on the Captain's plane.

537
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,132
Oh, it's quite the way to travel.

538
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,099
I wouldn't know.

539
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,465
No?. You never been on Tobacco One

540
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:42,802
with those seats, that kitchen,

541
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,569
that stewardess, Tiffany?.

542
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,701
Haven't had the chance yet.

543
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,108
Oh, well, you really must try it.

544
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,272
It's the onlyway to travel.

545
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,613
What'd he think ofyour $50 million
anti-smoking campaign?.

546
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,652
Oh, the $50 million
anti teen-smoking campaign?.

547
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:56,652
Yeah.

548
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:57,915
Yeah, he gave that the go-ahead.

549
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,183
Oh, and he loved your idea

550
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,588
to put cigarettes back into movies.

551
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,252
- That was your idea.
- Oh, yeah?.

552
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,488
- He must have gotten confused.
- Hmm.

553
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah. Well, eitherway,
he was pretty blown away.

554
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,763
Right. Well, get a flight to L.A.

555
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:13,963
I'll getyou a meeting
with Jeff Megall.

556
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,096
Who?.

557
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,468
Hollywood super agent.

558
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,238
Runs the agency EGO:
Entertainment Global Offices.

559
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,903
This guy is the entertainment business.

560
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,277
And you are cigarettes, BR.

561
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,247
Whatever.

562
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,979
Yeah, but it's not a vacation,
it's a learning experience.

563
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,147
And California is one
ofthe fastest-growing

564
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,451
states, it's got

565
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,253
the largest number of electoral
votes in the country.

566
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,158
I mean, this could be
a very good trip forJoey.

567
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,594
You know what?.
Don't smooth-talk me.

568
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:40,687
You're not going to
take him sightseeing.

569
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,857
You're probably going

570
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,958
to take him
to some lung cancer symposium

571
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,003
where a guywith an electronic
voice box will tell him

572
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,264
that his father is the devil.

573
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,532
That's unfair.

574
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,937
Unfair?. What about Virginia?.

575
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,406
And what about Virginia?.

576
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,272
You took him to a cigarette factory.

577
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,243
No, I took him to a tobacco farm.

578
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,541
That's hardly the same thing.

579
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,639
This conversation's over.

580
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,612
( sighs ): Oh, fuck.

581
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,451
Last weekwe had another
disgruntled postman.

582
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,548
Of course,

583
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,820
an hour later the Washington Post

584
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,726
is calling me on the phone-
godless swine.

585
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,355
I said to 'em, I says,

586
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:18,493
"Now if a plane crashes
on account of pilot error,

587
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:19,968
do you blame the Boeing Corporation??"

588
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,060
Nice.

589
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,537
- That's a good one.
- Thankyou.

590
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,201
If some booze-besotten drunk
runs someone down,

591
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,244
do you go banging on the doors
at General Motors?.

592
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,676
Tell meyou didn't say that.

593
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,145
Mm-hmm.

594
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,239
Have either ofyou heard of a
reporter named Heather Holloway?.

595
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,513
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Irish type.

596
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,985
Brown hair, big blue eyes.

597
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,180
Nice skin.

598
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:39,313
Amazing tits.

599
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:42,188
Tits?. Why are tits relevant?.

600
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:43,624
Hmm, let's see.

601
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,492
World-class tits on a reporter
interviewing a man

602
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:49,431
with privileged information
are relevant.

603
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,525
How about it, Nick?.
Areyou a tit man?.

604
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,433
Don't answer that.
That's a trap.

605
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:56,336
Depends whose tits.

606
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,238
Look,just don't get screwed,
all right?.

607
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,312
Bobby, I think I can handle
a good-looking girl reporter.

608
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,040
Thankyou.

609
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,281
Heather Holloway.

610
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,120
Nick Naylor, big tobacco.

611
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:19,023
Is this kosher?.

612
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,064
Only ifl can call you "Heather."

613
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,430
By all means.

614
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,026
So, Mr. Naylor...

615
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,231
- Nick.
- Nick.

616
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,365
Let's start with...

617
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,807
An '82 Margaux.

618
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,936
Okay. Is it good?.

619
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,482
Good?. It'll makeyou believe in God.

620
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,721
So what is the focus ofyour piece?.

621
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,664
- You.
- Really?.

622
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,599
You want to know how I live
with myself.

623
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:02,434
No. I don't imagine
that's much of a problem.

624
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,770
I want to know howyou seeyourself.

625
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,070
I'm...

626
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,941
a mediator between two sects
of society

627
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,742
that are trying
to reach an accommodation.

628
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,714
Interesting.

629
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:16,480
My other interviews have pinned
you as a mass murderer,

630
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,648
bloodsucker, pimp,
profiteer, child killer,

631
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:23,023
and my personal favorite
"yuppie Mephistopheles."

632
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:26,256
Wow, that sounds
like a balanced article.

633
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,423
Who else should I talk to?.

634
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,660
55 million American smokers,
for starters

635
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,636
or perhaps
the American tobacco farmer

636
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,865
who is constantly being treated
like a drug smuggler.

637
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,373
I actually do plan on speaking
to a tobacco farmer.

638
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,464
Good.

639
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,635
They're fine people,
salt ofthe earth.

640
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,145
Nick, why doyou do this?.

641
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,909
What motivates you?.

642
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,515
You reallywant to know?.

643
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,785
Mm-hmm.

644
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:55,917
Really?.

645
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,824
Mm-hmm.

646
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:02,559
( whispers ): Population control.

647
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,931
( chuckles )

648
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,596
You're bad.

649
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,168
Everyone's got a mortgage to pay.

650
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,507
NICK: Theyuppie Nuremberg defense.

651
00:30:14,611 --> 00:30:18,138
So is a mortgage that much
of a life goal?.

652
00:30:18,247 --> 00:30:22,547
Well, 99%%% of everything done
in the world, good or bad,

653
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:25,177
is done to pay a mortgage,
so perhaps the world

654
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:27,313
would be a better place
if everyone rented.

655
00:30:27,423 --> 00:30:29,516
Then why don't you rent?.

656
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:31,423
Mm. Well, I rent as well.

657
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:32,994
- Really?.
- Yeah.

658
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:35,360
My son and his mother
and her boyfriend

659
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:36,432
Iive in my house.

660
00:30:36,532 --> 00:30:37,658
I live in my apartment.

661
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:41,259
What does Nick Naylor's
apartment look like?.

662
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:43,805
I don't know.
It's nothing impressive.

663
00:30:43,906 --> 00:30:45,271
It wouldn't make
the real estate section.

664
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,273
( chuckles )

665
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:48,139
Can I see it?.

666
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,509
You want to see my apartment?.

667
00:30:52,615 --> 00:30:55,516
I'd like to see
where the devil sleeps.

668
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:03,951
NICK: I know what
you're probablythinking.

669
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:08,656
This is a bad idea, right?

670
00:31:11,401 --> 00:31:13,028
I mean, come on.

671
00:31:13,136 --> 00:31:14,228
It's not that bad ofan idea.

672
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,600
( sizzling )

673
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:21,108
( pots clattering )

674
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:30,443
Mom, why can't I go

675
00:31:30,553 --> 00:31:32,612
to Cal ifornia?.

676
00:31:32,722 --> 00:31:36,158
Because California's
just not a... safe place.

677
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:38,784
And besides,
I'm not sure it's appropriate

678
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:42,126
foryour father to bring you
on a business trip.

679
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:43,664
Appropriate forwho?.

680
00:31:43,766 --> 00:31:45,734
What?.

681
00:31:45,835 --> 00:31:48,133
Mom, is it possible that
you're taking the frustration

682
00:31:48,237 --> 00:31:50,102
ofyour failed marriage out on me?.

683
00:31:51,174 --> 00:31:53,642
Excuse me?.

684
00:31:53,743 --> 00:31:56,007
This California trip seems like
a great learning opportunity

685
00:31:56,112 --> 00:31:58,910
and a chance for me
to get to know my father.

686
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:00,744
But ifyou think it's more important

687
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,715
to use me to channel your frustration

688
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:04,719
against the man you no longer love,

689
00:32:04,821 --> 00:32:06,482
I'll understand.

690
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:13,461
How'd you convince her?.

691
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:15,758
It was an argument,
not a negotiation.

692
00:32:15,865 --> 00:32:17,492
That's my boy.

693
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,368
( soft music playing )

694
00:33:03,813 --> 00:33:05,474
Nick?.

695
00:33:05,581 --> 00:33:07,708
Nick,Jack,Jeff's assistant. Hey.

696
00:33:07,817 --> 00:33:10,081
How was your flight?.
Areyou jet-lagged at all?.

697
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:11,881
It's, like, 2:00 in D.C.
right now.

698
00:33:11,988 --> 00:33:13,455
You know what?.
Take some vitamin B.

699
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:14,784
Jeffswears by it- in fact,

700
00:33:14,891 --> 00:33:16,552
I'm gonna hookyou up
with an injection.

701
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:18,058
Who's this with you?.
How areyou, dude?. What's going on?.

702
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:19,253
You guys ever been to L.A. before?.

703
00:33:19,362 --> 00:33:21,193
You want to head back
toJeff's office?.

704
00:33:21,297 --> 00:33:23,663
In fact, we probably should-
He's a punctual being.

705
00:33:23,766 --> 00:33:26,599
We actually had some problems at first
with the exterior mirrored glass.

706
00:33:26,702 --> 00:33:29,262
The reflection ofthe sun was causing
head-on collisions on Wilshire.

707
00:33:29,372 --> 00:33:30,964
Oh, is everybody all right?.

708
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:33,234
Yeah, they got three-picture deals
at Paramount- I'm sure they'll live.

709
00:33:33,342 --> 00:33:34,570
- It's a nice building.
- Yeah?.

710
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:36,542
Hey, tell Jeffyou think so, okay?.

711
00:33:36,646 --> 00:33:39,171
'Cause he just put a lot
ofhimselfinto this building.

712
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:42,718
And you know something?.
It really shows.

713
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:44,377
What's up, Hiroshi?.

714
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:48,253
Keep going-that sand's
not gonna rake itself.

715
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:50,382
All right, come here,
this is my favorite part.

716
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:53,724
That one right there?.
It's $7,000.

717
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,855
- $7,000 for a fish?.
- ( laughs ): Yep.

718
00:33:55,965 --> 00:33:57,865
Kind of makes you want
to stop eating sushi,

719
00:33:57,967 --> 00:33:59,594
but I guess you kind ofhave to.

720
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:01,533
Hey, you see that
big white one right there?.

721
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:04,401
Swear toyou- $1 2,000,
gift from Oprah.

722
00:34:04,507 --> 00:34:08,307
It's a Chamberlain- office-warming gift
from Matthew McConaughey.

723
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:09,776
Generous gift.

724
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:11,904
( laughs ): Yeah. Right!

725
00:34:12,014 --> 00:34:14,847
Don't get me wrong, Matthew is
a tremendously talented individual

726
00:34:14,951 --> 00:34:16,441
and an extremely decent human being,

727
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:19,077
however, beforeJeff
took him on, he was a face.

728
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:20,416
Now he's a name.

729
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:22,991
( elevatorbell dings )

730
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,961
Do you hear that?.

731
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,530
No.

732
00:34:32,602 --> 00:34:34,832
Exactly.

733
00:34:34,937 --> 00:34:36,370
( bell dings )

734
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:45,078
Hey, Neal.

735
00:34:45,181 --> 00:34:47,445
Neal, I'm gonna impale
your mom on a spike,

736
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,212
and I'm gonna feed her dead body
to my dog with syphilis.

737
00:34:50,319 --> 00:34:52,082
( laughs ): Aw,Jack, you got me!

738
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:53,849
NEAL: That guy!

739
00:34:53,956 --> 00:34:56,652
It's an inside joke.

740
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:59,023
( sighs ):
So, as you can see,

741
00:34:59,128 --> 00:35:01,323
Jeff just really loves Asian shit.

742
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,159
Uh, Candace, is he ready?.

743
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:04,927
- Mm-hmm.
- Fantastic.

744
00:35:05,034 --> 00:35:07,298
( quietly): Okay,Joey,
I'm gonna bring your dad in now.

745
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:09,428
Is there anything I can get
you whileyou're waiting,

746
00:35:09,538 --> 00:35:11,733
Iike an orange juice
or a coffee or a Red Bull?.

747
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:14,241
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

748
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:18,714
Wow, it's a great office.

749
00:35:18,814 --> 00:35:20,805
Yeah.Jeffbasically designed
the whole thing.

750
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:22,817
The architect just made the drawings.

751
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:25,285
Jack, stop it.

752
00:35:25,388 --> 00:35:26,685
Nextyou're gonna be telling him

753
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:28,279
what position I played
for the Bruins.

754
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:29,289
( quietly): Quarterback.

755
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:30,654
Jeff Megall.

756
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,988
Nick Naylor.

757
00:35:32,094 --> 00:35:34,324
Mr. Naylor's here to see
ifwe can't get cigarettes

758
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,955
- into the hands of somebody
other than the usual RAVs.
- Sure.

759
00:35:37,066 --> 00:35:39,557
- RAVs?.
- Russians, Arabs and Villains.

760
00:35:39,669 --> 00:35:41,398
Oh, well, then yes, I guess
that is why I'm here.

761
00:35:41,504 --> 00:35:43,699
Good. I thinkwe can help.

762
00:35:43,806 --> 00:35:45,899
Jeffinvented product placement.

763
00:35:46,008 --> 00:35:47,976
NICK: I feel I have to ask, uh...

764
00:35:48,077 --> 00:35:51,069
Areyou concerned at
all about the, um...

765
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,738
about the health element?.

766
00:35:52,848 --> 00:35:55,715
I'm not a doctor, I'm a facilitator.

767
00:35:55,818 --> 00:35:57,080
I bring creative people together.

768
00:35:57,186 --> 00:35:59,381
Whatever information there is,
exists, it's out there.

769
00:35:59,488 --> 00:36:00,682
People will decide for themselves.

770
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,224
They should. It's not
my role to decide for them.

771
00:36:03,326 --> 00:36:05,226
It'd be morally presumptuous.

772
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:07,888
NICK: I couldlearn a lot
from this man.

773
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:10,363
Now, what we need is
a smoking role model,

774
00:36:10,466 --> 00:36:11,398
a real winner.

775
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,195
Indiana Jones meets Jerry Maguire.

776
00:36:13,302 --> 00:36:14,360
Right, on two packs a day.

777
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,495
Only he can't live
in contemporary society.

778
00:36:16,605 --> 00:36:17,503
Why not?.

779
00:36:17,606 --> 00:36:19,597
The health issue's way too prevalent.

780
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:21,643
People would constantly
be asking the character

781
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:24,008
why he's smoking-
and that should go unsaid.

782
00:36:24,113 --> 00:36:26,047
How doyou feel about the future?.

783
00:36:26,148 --> 00:36:28,343
The future?.

784
00:36:28,451 --> 00:36:30,180
Yeah, after the health thing's
blown over.

785
00:36:30,286 --> 00:36:31,617
A world
where smokers and nonsmokers

786
00:36:31,721 --> 00:36:33,120
Iive together in perfect harmony.

787
00:36:33,222 --> 00:36:35,588
Sony has a futuristic sci-fi movie
they're looking to make.

788
00:36:35,691 --> 00:36:37,625
Message From SectorSix.

789
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:39,752
All takes place in a space station.

790
00:36:39,862 --> 00:36:41,727
They're actively looking
for some cofinancing.

791
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:43,298
So cigarettes in space?.

792
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:45,526
It's the final frontier, Nick.

793
00:36:45,634 --> 00:36:47,625
But wouldn't they blow up
in an all-oxygen environment?.

794
00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:50,433
Probably.

795
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:53,133
But it's an easy fix-
one line of dialogue:

796
00:36:53,242 --> 00:36:55,210
"Thank God we invented the..."
you know,

797
00:36:55,311 --> 00:36:56,608
whatever device.

798
00:36:56,712 --> 00:36:58,577
Brad Pitt.

799
00:36:58,681 --> 00:37:00,239
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

800
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:01,748
They've just finished ravishing

801
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:04,445
each other's bodies
for the first time.

802
00:37:04,553 --> 00:37:06,578
They lie naked, suspended in air

803
00:37:06,689 --> 00:37:08,122
underneath the heavens.

804
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,590
Pitt lights up.

805
00:37:10,693 --> 00:37:12,422
He starts blowing smoke rings
all around

806
00:37:12,528 --> 00:37:14,325
Catherine's naked, flawless body,

807
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,593
as the galaxies go whizzing
by over the glass-domed ceiling.

808
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,759
Now, tell me that
doesn't work foryou.

809
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:21,166
I'd see that movie.

810
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,532
I'd buy the goddamn DVD.

811
00:37:22,638 --> 00:37:25,334
You know, ifthe academy
didn't send them to me for free.

812
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:26,908
You know,

813
00:37:27,009 --> 00:37:29,170
you guys ought to think
about designing a cigarette

814
00:37:29,278 --> 00:37:31,007
to be released simultaneously
with the movie.

815
00:37:31,113 --> 00:37:32,671
Sector Sixes.

816
00:37:32,782 --> 00:37:34,340
No one's ever done it
with a cigarette.

817
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,576
Wow.

818
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:37,584
Well, where do we go from here?.

819
00:37:37,686 --> 00:37:40,519
You enjoy the rest ofyour day
in L.A. with your son

820
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:42,557
while I find out
the answers to these questions.

821
00:37:42,658 --> 00:37:45,286
Hey, where can I get
a bite to eat with my son?.

822
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:46,918
You ought to try Nobu's new place.

823
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:49,429
- He only serves food that's white.
- Oh, great.

824
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:52,929
JOEY: So,you go to an office,

825
00:37:53,035 --> 00:37:55,663
thenyou go on TV
and talk about cigarettes.

826
00:37:55,771 --> 00:37:57,602
Thenyou fly out to L.A.

827
00:37:57,706 --> 00:38:00,174
to talk to some guy who
works with movie stars.

828
00:38:00,276 --> 00:38:03,575
- What is that?.
- That's my job;, I'm a lobbyist.

829
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:06,341
I know, but did you study to do that?.

830
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:08,940
No. No, I just kind offigured it out.

831
00:38:09,051 --> 00:38:11,144
Then can't anyone just do that?.

832
00:38:11,253 --> 00:38:15,189
No, it, uh, requires a...

833
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:19,022
a moral flexibility
that goes beyond most people.

834
00:38:20,129 --> 00:38:22,962
Do I have flexible morals?.

835
00:38:23,065 --> 00:38:25,761
Well, let's say
you became a lawyer, right?.

836
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:27,495
And you were asked
to defend a murderer.

837
00:38:27,603 --> 00:38:29,127
Worse than that- a child murderer.

838
00:38:29,238 --> 00:38:30,535
Now,

839
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:33,631
the law states that every person
deserves a fair trial.

840
00:38:33,742 --> 00:38:35,835
Would you defend them?.

841
00:38:35,945 --> 00:38:37,640
I don't know.
I guess every person

842
00:38:37,746 --> 00:38:39,577
- deserves a fair defense.
- Yeah, well,

843
00:38:39,682 --> 00:38:41,809
so do multinational corporations.

844
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:45,216
So, what happens when you're wrong?.

845
00:38:45,321 --> 00:38:46,982
( chuckles ):
Well,Joey, I'm neverwrong.

846
00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:48,556
Butyou can't always be right.

847
00:38:48,657 --> 00:38:51,592
Well, ifit's yourjob to be right,
then you're neverwrong.

848
00:38:51,694 --> 00:38:53,889
But what ifyou are wrong?.

849
00:38:53,996 --> 00:38:56,157
Okay, let's say that
you're defending chocolate

850
00:38:56,265 --> 00:38:57,596
and I'm defending vanilla.

851
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,100
Now, ifl were to say toyou,

852
00:39:00,202 --> 00:39:03,103
"Vanilla's the best flavor
ice cream," you'd say...?.

853
00:39:03,205 --> 00:39:05,264
- "No, chocolate is."
- Exactly.

854
00:39:05,374 --> 00:39:06,966
But you can't win that argument.

855
00:39:07,076 --> 00:39:09,636
So, I'll askyou-
So you think chocolate

856
00:39:09,745 --> 00:39:12,543
is the end-all and be-all
ofice cream, doyou?.

857
00:39:12,648 --> 00:39:14,707
It's the best ice cream;
I wouldn't order any other.

858
00:39:14,817 --> 00:39:16,717
Oh. So it's all chocolate
foryou, is it?.

859
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:18,411
Yes, chocolate is all I need.

860
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:19,818
Well, I need more than chocolate.

861
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:21,913
And for that matter,
I need more than vanilla.

862
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:23,787
I believe that we need
freedom and choice

863
00:39:23,893 --> 00:39:26,384
when it comes to our ice cream,
and that,Joey Naylor,

864
00:39:26,495 --> 00:39:28,019
that is the definition ofliberty.

865
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,064
But that's not what
we're talking about.

866
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:32,566
Ah, but that's what
I'm talking about.

867
00:39:32,668 --> 00:39:35,603
- But... you didn't prove that vanilla's the best.
- I didn't have to.

868
00:39:35,704 --> 00:39:38,537
I proved thatyou're wrong-
and ifyou're wrong, I'm right.

869
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:39,608
Butyou still didn't

870
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:40,766
convince me.

871
00:39:40,876 --> 00:39:42,207
'Cause I'm not afteryou.

872
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:45,610
I'm after them.

873
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,758
( phone ringing )

874
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:03,164
Hello?.

875
00:40:03,265 --> 00:40:05,165
Thought I'd giveyou a little update.

876
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:07,235
Jeff. You still at the office?.

877
00:40:07,336 --> 00:40:09,861
Doyou know what time it is
in Tokyo right now?.

878
00:40:09,972 --> 00:40:11,735
- No.
- 4:00 p.m. tomorrow.

879
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,637
It's the future, Nick.

880
00:40:14,843 --> 00:40:16,572
Anyway, for Pitt to smoke,

881
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:18,909
it's $1 0 million;
for the pair, it's 25.

882
00:40:19,014 --> 00:40:22,177
25??!. Usuallywhen I buy two
ofsomething, I get a discount.

883
00:40:22,284 --> 00:40:23,478
What's the extra five for?.

884
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:24,746
Synergy.

885
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:27,617
These are not stupid people;
they got it right away.

886
00:40:27,723 --> 00:40:29,953
Pitt and Zeta-Jones lighting up
after some cosmic fucking

887
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:32,527
in the bubble suite's
gonna sell a lot of cigarettes.

888
00:40:32,628 --> 00:40:34,061
Well, for that kind of money,

889
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:36,063
my people will expect
some very serious smoking.

890
00:40:36,165 --> 00:40:37,655
Can Brad blow smoke rings?.

891
00:40:37,766 --> 00:40:39,165
I don't have that information.

892
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:40,963
Well, for $25 million,
we'd want smoke rings.

893
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,560
Oh, one other thing-
you'll be cofinancing

894
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:44,605
the picture
with the Sultan ofGlutan.

895
00:40:44,707 --> 00:40:45,901
The Sultan ofGlutan?.

896
00:40:46,008 --> 00:40:48,033
The onewho massacred
and enslaved his own people?.

897
00:40:48,143 --> 00:40:50,634
Aren't they calling him
the Hitler ofthe South Pacific?.

898
00:40:50,746 --> 00:40:53,180
No, I can't speak to that-
All my dealings with him,

899
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:55,011
he's been a very reasonable
and sensitive guy.

900
00:40:55,117 --> 00:40:56,345
He's fun. You'll like him.

901
00:40:56,452 --> 00:40:57,646
I better run it by my people.

902
00:40:57,753 --> 00:40:58,845
No problem.

903
00:40:58,954 --> 00:41:00,319
- ( beep )
- Oh, that's London calling.

904
00:41:00,422 --> 00:41:02,549
7;:00 a.m. in the Old Empire.

905
00:41:02,658 --> 00:41:04,216
Jeff, when doyou sleep?.

906
00:41:04,326 --> 00:41:05,554
Sunday.

907
00:41:05,661 --> 00:41:07,390
( line hangs up )

908
00:41:21,577 --> 00:41:23,545
( laughs softly)

909
00:41:59,815 --> 00:42:01,806
( groans )

910
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:05,887
( line ringing )

911
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:10,181
- Operator.
- Yeah, my light is blinking.

912
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:13,523
- There's a package downstairs foryou.
- Okay, send it up.

913
00:42:16,065 --> 00:42:19,262
Captain, I'm sitting in front
of an open briefcase.

914
00:42:19,368 --> 00:42:21,393
I don't suppose this is a raise.

915
00:42:21,503 --> 00:42:25,303
Now, Nick, doyou know
who Lorne Lutch is?.

916
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,102
Yeah, of course.
He's the original Marlboro Man.

917
00:42:27,209 --> 00:42:29,677
He's dying.
He was on Sally last week.

918
00:42:29,778 --> 00:42:31,973
Not exactly our biggest fan.

919
00:42:32,081 --> 00:42:33,309
Well, the money's for him.

920
00:42:33,415 --> 00:42:36,043
Now, he has a ranch
out there in California.

921
00:42:36,151 --> 00:42:37,812
I wantyou to bring it to him.

922
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,754
He's a cowboy, sir,
and cowboys don't like bribes.

923
00:42:41,857 --> 00:42:44,018
It's not a bribe. No, sir.

924
00:42:44,126 --> 00:42:46,890
You're going out there
on wings ofangels, son.

925
00:42:46,995 --> 00:42:49,930
You mean we're just going
to give him the money?.

926
00:42:50,032 --> 00:42:51,431
Well, I think Christ himself
would say,

927
00:42:51,533 --> 00:42:53,763
"That's mightywhite ofyou boys."

928
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:55,928
No gag agreement?.

929
00:42:56,038 --> 00:42:58,438
Hopefully, he'll be so damn
overcome with gratitude

930
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,872
he'll... he'll have to shut up.

931
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,952
Hey, kiddo, I got to go do
a little bit more work

932
00:43:14,056 --> 00:43:15,148
this afternoon, all right?.

933
00:43:15,257 --> 00:43:16,155
Can I come?.

934
00:43:16,258 --> 00:43:17,691
No. Not this time.

935
00:43:17,793 --> 00:43:19,954
But I want to see whatyou do.

936
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:02,862
You stay here, okay?.

937
00:44:22,024 --> 00:44:24,584
What the fuck areyou doing here?.

938
00:44:24,693 --> 00:44:27,287
Uh... uh...

939
00:44:27,396 --> 00:44:29,091
Doyou have a minute?.

940
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:35,897
What doyou want?.

941
00:44:36,004 --> 00:44:37,232
Dad!

942
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:38,465
Joey, get back in the car.

943
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,071
Just want to talk.

944
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:50,476
All right.

945
00:44:50,586 --> 00:44:52,053
Let's talk.

946
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:10,904
Pearl, we got company.

947
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:16,739
Mister, you got a lot of nerve
walking in here after...

948
00:45:16,845 --> 00:45:20,212
Honey, why don't you show
this young man some iced tea?.

949
00:45:23,352 --> 00:45:24,842
I'll be right back, tiger.

950
00:45:31,326 --> 00:45:33,123
( hissing )

951
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:43,830
Saw you on...

952
00:45:43,939 --> 00:45:47,431
Weren't you on that TV show?.

953
00:45:47,543 --> 00:45:50,341
Yeah. Yeah, that was me.

954
00:45:50,445 --> 00:45:54,006
You're luckyyou made it
out ofthere alive.

955
00:45:54,116 --> 00:45:56,414
Yeah. Tobacco used to be
all over the television.

956
00:45:56,518 --> 00:46:00,511
Now TV is leading the witch hunt.

957
00:46:00,622 --> 00:46:02,487
Strange business.

958
00:46:02,591 --> 00:46:05,492
Lastyear, after I was diagnosed,

959
00:46:05,594 --> 00:46:11,123
flew east to attend the
annual stockholders' convention.

960
00:46:12,901 --> 00:46:14,869
Stood up and told them
I thought

961
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:19,600
they ought to cut back
on their advertising.

962
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:22,302
You know whatyour boss said to me?.

963
00:46:25,547 --> 00:46:28,607
He said, "We're certainly sorry

964
00:46:28,717 --> 00:46:32,483
"to hear aboutyour medical problem.

965
00:46:32,588 --> 00:46:36,024
"However, without
knowing more

966
00:46:36,124 --> 00:46:39,787
"ofyour medical history,

967
00:46:39,895 --> 00:46:41,988
we can't comment further."

968
00:46:44,566 --> 00:46:46,796
But then they tried to pretend

969
00:46:46,902 --> 00:46:48,631
I neverworked for 'em.

970
00:46:50,572 --> 00:46:52,802
Yeah, I got the pay stubs.

971
00:46:52,908 --> 00:46:55,672
But, hell,
I was on the damn billboards.

972
00:46:57,412 --> 00:46:59,141
I never
even smoked

973
00:46:59,247 --> 00:47:01,272
Marlboro.

974
00:47:01,383 --> 00:47:03,851
I smoked Kools.

975
00:47:08,256 --> 00:47:11,384
You look like a nice-enough fella.

976
00:47:11,493 --> 00:47:13,791
What areyou doing
working for these assholes?.

977
00:47:15,697 --> 00:47:17,756
I'm good at it.

978
00:47:17,866 --> 00:47:19,094
Better at doing this

979
00:47:19,201 --> 00:47:20,862
than I everwas
at doing anything else.

980
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:22,903
Aw, hell, son.

981
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:25,565
I was good at shooting VC.

982
00:47:25,674 --> 00:47:27,642
I didn't make it my career.

983
00:47:29,945 --> 00:47:33,608
I suppose we all
got to pay the mortgage.

984
00:47:37,452 --> 00:47:39,613
Your dad always bring
you along like this?.

985
00:47:39,721 --> 00:47:42,451
No. I live with my mom.

986
00:47:42,557 --> 00:47:44,286
He tell you why he's here today?.

987
00:47:44,393 --> 00:47:48,227
He said thatyour husband
was the Marlboro Man.

988
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,729
( phone rings )

989
00:47:49,831 --> 00:47:53,631
Yeah, well, not anymore.

990
00:47:53,735 --> 00:47:55,202
Hello.

991
00:47:55,303 --> 00:47:57,464
Yeah. Hey, can you hold on a second?.

992
00:47:57,572 --> 00:48:01,668
You need anything else,
grab it out ofthe fridge.

993
00:48:01,777 --> 00:48:03,438
So I'm standing here
minding my own business,

994
00:48:03,545 --> 00:48:05,410
filling up pill bottles...

995
00:48:05,514 --> 00:48:11,419
Soyou're here to talk me
into shutting up?.

996
00:48:13,288 --> 00:48:15,552
Thatwhat's in that case ofyours?.

997
00:48:15,657 --> 00:48:18,319
Yeah, basically.

998
00:48:19,528 --> 00:48:20,927
No, not basically.

999
00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:23,259
That's... that's exactly it.

1000
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:26,994
My dignity ain't for sale.

1001
00:48:27,102 --> 00:48:29,570
It's not an offer.
It's a gift.

1002
00:48:29,671 --> 00:48:30,797
Taxes have all been paid.

1003
00:48:30,906 --> 00:48:33,636
You get to keep it
no matterwhatyou do.

1004
00:48:33,742 --> 00:48:35,175
The idea is that, somehow,

1005
00:48:35,277 --> 00:48:37,905
your guilt will preventyou
from bad-mouthing us.

1006
00:48:38,013 --> 00:48:39,810
Areyou supposed to be

1007
00:48:39,915 --> 00:48:41,610
telling me all that?.

1008
00:48:41,717 --> 00:48:44,242
No, sir.Just apologize,

1009
00:48:44,352 --> 00:48:46,115
giveyou the money, and leave.

1010
00:48:46,221 --> 00:48:47,984
Why are you telling me this?.

1011
00:48:50,525 --> 00:48:52,493
Because, this way,
you'll take the money.

1012
00:48:52,594 --> 00:48:53,856
Whywould I do that?.

1013
00:48:53,962 --> 00:48:54,951
Becauseyou're mad.

1014
00:48:55,063 --> 00:48:56,496
Damn straight I am.

1015
00:48:56,598 --> 00:48:57,587
The first thing you'll do,

1016
00:48:57,699 --> 00:48:59,792
is you'll call the L.A. Times,
and CNN...

1017
00:48:59,901 --> 00:49:01,300
- Huh?.
- and insist on Bonnie Carlton.

1018
00:49:01,403 --> 00:49:02,301
She does really good

1019
00:49:02,404 --> 00:49:03,302
controlled outrage.

1020
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:04,633
Tell them, "No Bonnie, no story."

1021
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,764
Watch it on MSNBC.

1022
00:49:05,874 --> 00:49:07,171
- Okay.
- When they get here,

1023
00:49:07,275 --> 00:49:10,210
you open up the case...

1024
00:49:12,914 --> 00:49:16,077
and you pour all the cash
out onto the floor.

1025
00:49:16,184 --> 00:49:17,242
- Why?.
- Trust me.

1026
00:49:17,352 --> 00:49:18,546
It'll look more effective that way.

1027
00:49:18,653 --> 00:49:22,714
Don't forget to shake
every last bundle out.

1028
00:49:24,459 --> 00:49:26,120
Ifyou can, you know,
give a cough or two.

1029
00:49:26,228 --> 00:49:29,129
Once it's all
out on the floor,

1030
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:30,698
tell them what you're
going to do with it.

1031
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:31,766
What am I going to do with it?.

1032
00:49:31,867 --> 00:49:32,891
You're going to donate it.

1033
00:49:33,001 --> 00:49:35,196
Yeah. Start the Lorne Lutch
Cancer Foundation.

1034
00:49:35,303 --> 00:49:36,634
You're going to have
a ranch and a fair

1035
00:49:36,738 --> 00:49:39,366
and a 5K.
A 5K is a must. Television...

1036
00:49:39,474 --> 00:49:40,498
Wait a minute.

1037
00:49:40,609 --> 00:49:42,839
What about my family?.

1038
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,475
But, Lorne, you can't keep the money.

1039
00:49:47,582 --> 00:49:49,072
Why the hell not?.

1040
00:49:49,184 --> 00:49:50,412
What doyou mean?.

1041
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:53,113
Denounce us,
and then keep the blood money?.

1042
00:49:53,221 --> 00:49:54,518
I mean, look at it.

1043
00:50:01,797 --> 00:50:02,695
I got to think this over.

1044
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:03,662
Lorne, whoa.

1045
00:50:03,765 --> 00:50:05,756
News doesn't work that way.

1046
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:07,892
You can't denounce us next week.

1047
00:50:14,509 --> 00:50:17,774
I don't suppose I can
denounce you for half of it.

1048
00:50:17,879 --> 00:50:21,246
No, Lorne. Eitheryou keep
all the money,

1049
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:24,113
oryou... you give it all away.

1050
00:50:34,563 --> 00:50:36,724
Dad, how did you know

1051
00:50:36,832 --> 00:50:38,697
he would take the money?.

1052
00:50:41,036 --> 00:50:43,937
You'd have to be crazy
to turn down all that money.

1053
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:46,507
When I saw he wasn't crazy,
I knew he'd take it.

1054
00:50:48,009 --> 00:50:50,477
Would you have taken it?.

1055
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:53,139
If I were him?. Sure.

1056
00:50:55,884 --> 00:50:57,351
So would I.

1057
00:51:08,897 --> 00:51:09,955
I don't thinkyou understand, sir.

1058
00:51:10,065 --> 00:51:11,362
He's like a wild animal.

1059
00:51:11,466 --> 00:51:13,127
You'll have to be
on your guard at all times.

1060
00:51:13,235 --> 00:51:14,224
He has this trick.

1061
00:51:14,336 --> 00:51:15,530
Ron, shut up.

1062
00:51:15,637 --> 00:51:17,468
I've tangoed with presidents,
lawyers and Indian chiefs.

1063
00:51:17,572 --> 00:51:20,132
I think I can handle Mr. Nick Naylor.

1064
00:51:20,242 --> 00:51:22,005
( clears throat )

1065
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:23,304
DENNIS MI LLER:
All right, welcome back, kids.

1066
00:51:23,411 --> 00:51:25,311
We've got two guests
on the show tonight.

1067
00:51:25,413 --> 00:51:27,404
First,joining us
from ourWashington studio...

1068
00:51:27,515 --> 00:51:29,449
I must have that tie clip!

1069
00:51:29,551 --> 00:51:32,145
...is the senator from
the great state ofVermont.

1070
00:51:32,254 --> 00:51:34,415
Please welcome Ortolan Finistirre.

1071
00:51:34,522 --> 00:51:35,420
Welcome, Senator.

1072
00:51:35,523 --> 00:51:37,081
Good to be here, Dennis.

1073
00:51:37,192 --> 00:51:38,887
And,joining us here
in our Los Angeles studio,

1074
00:51:38,994 --> 00:51:40,859
he is the chiefspokesperson

1075
00:51:40,962 --> 00:51:43,157
for the Academy ofTobacco Studies.

1076
00:51:43,265 --> 00:51:44,755
Quite an august chamber, might I add?.

1077
00:51:44,866 --> 00:51:46,629
- Nick Naylor. Nick, welcome.
- Pleasure to be here.

1078
00:51:46,735 --> 00:51:49,465
All right, I understand you were
on Joan Lunden's show recently.

1079
00:51:49,571 --> 00:51:51,163
Didn't make a lot
offriends over there, did you?.

1080
00:51:51,273 --> 00:51:52,638
I will say that I don't think

1081
00:51:52,741 --> 00:51:54,038
I'll be getting
my annual invitation

1082
00:51:54,142 --> 00:51:56,906
to the Finistirre Labor Day Barbecue.

1083
00:51:57,012 --> 00:51:59,412
Well, I continue to offer
an open invitation to Mr. Naylor

1084
00:51:59,514 --> 00:52:01,846
to join us in Congress
to talk about the inclusion

1085
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,680
of our new poison label which,
ifl might say...

1086
00:52:04,786 --> 00:52:06,947
Nick, ready to trek up
the Hill and testify

1087
00:52:07,055 --> 00:52:08,249
before Congress?.

1088
00:52:08,356 --> 00:52:10,517
Well, I'd love to, Dennis,
but not as long as the senator

1089
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:11,990
is calling for me to be fired.

1090
00:52:12,093 --> 00:52:14,391
It's not exactly
a welcome invitation.

1091
00:52:14,496 --> 00:52:17,021
Yeah. Bit ofa mixed message,
Senator.

1092
00:52:17,132 --> 00:52:19,396
Well, not as mixed as the stance
that Big Tobacco has taken

1093
00:52:19,501 --> 00:52:21,264
about the dangers
of smoking cigarettes.

1094
00:52:21,369 --> 00:52:22,802
- Oh, no.
- Now what areyou laughing...?.

1095
00:52:22,904 --> 00:52:24,997
You're a wind-up artist.
Give the man his due.

1096
00:52:25,106 --> 00:52:26,903
He's got a bit of a point there,
doesn't he?.

1097
00:52:27,008 --> 00:52:28,873
Sorry. I just can't
help myself, Dennis.

1098
00:52:28,977 --> 00:52:30,638
I... I... I'm just tickled by the idea

1099
00:52:30,745 --> 00:52:32,440
ofthe gentleman from Vermont

1100
00:52:32,547 --> 00:52:35,107
calling me a hypocrite
when, uh... this same man,

1101
00:52:35,216 --> 00:52:37,081
in one day, held a press
conference where he called

1102
00:52:37,185 --> 00:52:39,676
for the American tobacco fields
to be slashed and burned,

1103
00:52:39,788 --> 00:52:41,380
then he jumped on a private jet

1104
00:52:41,489 --> 00:52:43,980
and flew down to Farm Aid
where he rode a tractor onstage

1105
00:52:44,092 --> 00:52:47,084
- Oh, come on.
- as he bemoaned the downfall
ofthe American farmer.

1106
00:52:47,195 --> 00:52:48,992
Care to comment, Senator?.

1107
00:52:49,097 --> 00:52:51,031
He... I... No.

1108
00:52:51,132 --> 00:52:53,362
Eloquent in its brevity.

1109
00:52:53,468 --> 00:52:54,594
Emotional issue.

1110
00:52:54,703 --> 00:52:55,931
Let's take some phone calls now.

1111
00:52:56,037 --> 00:52:58,335
Herndon, Virginia.
Go ahead. You're on the show.

1112
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,931
MAN: Dennis, has anyone ever
announced that they're going

1113
00:53:01,042 --> 00:53:02,805
to kill someone live on your show?.

1114
00:53:02,911 --> 00:53:06,142
My demo's been called quirky
but, no, at this point,

1115
00:53:06,247 --> 00:53:08,340
we're not skewing
to the emotionally unstable.

1116
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:10,577
Then it's your lucky day.

1117
00:53:10,685 --> 00:53:12,346
Because I'm here to tell
you that, within a week,

1118
00:53:12,454 --> 00:53:15,048
we're going to dispatch
Mr. Naylor from this planet

1119
00:53:15,156 --> 00:53:18,853
for all the pain and suffering
he's caused in the world.

1120
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,985
( click )

1121
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:25,121
As I said, emotional issue.
We're going to break now.

1122
00:53:25,233 --> 00:53:26,996
I got to fire a call screener.

1123
00:53:53,928 --> 00:53:55,395
Let's go.

1124
00:54:25,393 --> 00:54:26,758
( chuckling )

1125
00:54:26,861 --> 00:54:28,226
( moans )

1126
00:54:31,066 --> 00:54:33,728
This is Nick Naylor
telling you kids,

1127
00:54:33,835 --> 00:54:37,032
"Don't do drugs, smoke cigarettes."

1128
00:54:37,138 --> 00:54:38,298
That's really great.

1129
00:54:38,406 --> 00:54:40,033
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.

1130
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:42,268
New idea:

1131
00:54:42,377 --> 00:54:44,743
cigarettes for the homeless.

1132
00:54:44,846 --> 00:54:45,938
We'll call them "hobos."

1133
00:54:46,047 --> 00:54:47,378
( chuckling )

1134
00:54:47,482 --> 00:54:48,847
Uh, that's awful.

1135
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,474
Any better than "Sector Sixes"?.

1136
00:54:50,585 --> 00:54:52,553
Right.

1137
00:54:52,654 --> 00:54:55,487
Oh, my God, Nick, you're on TV.

1138
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:56,557
( TVplaying )

1139
00:54:56,658 --> 00:54:59,286
"Lobbyist on the lookout."

1140
00:54:59,394 --> 00:55:02,591
You got to be kidding me.

1141
00:55:03,865 --> 00:55:07,562
I want to fuckyou
while I watch you on TV.

1142
00:55:07,669 --> 00:55:09,398
And they call me sick.

1143
00:55:09,504 --> 00:55:10,402
Hurry.

1144
00:55:10,505 --> 00:55:12,496
Before your segment ends.

1145
00:55:12,607 --> 00:55:14,541
All right.

1146
00:55:20,315 --> 00:55:22,442
Tell me more about Los Angeles, baby.

1147
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:23,710
Huh?.

1148
00:55:27,922 --> 00:55:29,719
NICK: He says he wants
to trail me everywhere,

1149
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:30,984
I said, "Who's paying for it??"

1150
00:55:31,092 --> 00:55:32,582
He says the tobacco company's
paying for it.

1151
00:55:32,694 --> 00:55:34,218
I said, "I don't need a bodyguard."

1152
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:35,887
I'm a man of the people.

1153
00:55:35,997 --> 00:55:37,862
Rock on, Kennedy.

1154
00:55:37,966 --> 00:55:39,661
Listen, we're all going to
need bodyguards soon enough.

1155
00:55:39,767 --> 00:55:41,564
Did you see the coverage
the fetal alcohol people

1156
00:55:41,669 --> 00:55:42,727
got themselves over this weekend?.

1157
00:55:42,837 --> 00:55:44,668
They made it seem like
we were encouraging

1158
00:55:44,772 --> 00:55:45,898
pregnant women to drink.

1159
00:55:46,007 --> 00:55:47,099
I'm surprised I didn't get kidnapped

1160
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:48,539
on myway to work this morning.

1161
00:55:48,643 --> 00:55:52,135
I don't think people from
the alcoholic beverage industry

1162
00:55:52,247 --> 00:55:54,238
need to worry about
being kidnapped justyet.

1163
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,442
Pardon me?.

1164
00:55:57,552 --> 00:55:58,849
Look, I mean,

1165
00:55:58,953 --> 00:56:00,944
nothing personal,
but tobacco generates

1166
00:56:01,055 --> 00:56:03,285
a little more heat than alcohol.

1167
00:56:03,391 --> 00:56:04,858
Oh, this is news.

1168
00:56:04,959 --> 00:56:08,588
My product puts away 475,000 a year.

1169
00:56:08,696 --> 00:56:11,358
Oh, okay, now 475 is a legit number.

1170
00:56:11,466 --> 00:56:12,694
Okay, 435,000.

1171
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,858
That's 1,200 a day.

1172
00:56:13,968 --> 00:56:15,299
How many alcohol-related deaths
a year?.

1173
00:56:15,403 --> 00:56:17,530
- Well, does that...
- 1 00,000 tops?.

1174
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:21,268
That's, what, 270 a day?.

1175
00:56:21,376 --> 00:56:22,536
Wowee.

1176
00:56:22,644 --> 00:56:25,010
270 people, a tragedy.

1177
00:56:25,113 --> 00:56:27,104
Excuse me ifl don't exactly see
terrorists getting excited

1178
00:56:27,215 --> 00:56:28,842
about kidnapping anyone
from the alcohol industry.

1179
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,212
- Well, you haven't even
- Okay,

1180
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:32,149
- taken into account the number of deaths
- let's just

1181
00:56:32,253 --> 00:56:34,949
- breathe.
- How many gun deaths a year in the U.S.?.

1182
00:56:35,056 --> 00:56:36,785
1 1,000.

1183
00:56:36,891 --> 00:56:39,223
1 1,000, areyou kidding me?.

1184
00:56:39,327 --> 00:56:41,261
30 a day.

1185
00:56:41,362 --> 00:56:42,795
That's less than passenger car
mortalities.

1186
00:56:42,897 --> 00:56:44,489
No terrorist would bother
with either ofyou.

1187
00:56:58,179 --> 00:56:59,942
Okay, look...
stupid argument.

1188
00:57:00,048 --> 00:57:02,073
I'll say.

1189
00:57:02,183 --> 00:57:05,152
I'm sure both ofyou warrant
vigilante justice.

1190
00:57:05,253 --> 00:57:07,016
Thankyou.

1191
00:57:12,961 --> 00:57:14,656
( motorrevs )

1192
00:57:14,762 --> 00:57:16,229
( tires screech )

1193
00:57:19,033 --> 00:57:21,092
( grunting, groaning )

1194
00:57:21,202 --> 00:57:22,863
( engine racing,
overlapping voices )

1195
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:29,137
Hey... please.
Stop... hey.

1196
00:57:29,244 --> 00:57:30,336
Who are you guys?.

1197
00:57:30,445 --> 00:57:32,072
( tires screeching )

1198
00:57:34,249 --> 00:57:36,547
GI RL: And freedom means
that we can do what we want.

1199
00:57:36,651 --> 00:57:39,017
And that's really important.

1200
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,715
Because otherwise,
we couldn't be free.

1201
00:57:42,824 --> 00:57:46,851
And that's why America is
the best government in the world.

1202
00:57:46,961 --> 00:57:48,519
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

1203
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:51,326
Hey, no need for that,
no need for that.

1204
00:57:51,432 --> 00:57:52,797
Whoa, whoa, hey.

1205
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:53,867
Hey, wait.

1206
00:57:53,968 --> 00:57:55,162
Can we get a dialogue going here?.

1207
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:58,034
Nick, we want you
to stop killing people.

1208
00:57:58,139 --> 00:57:59,868
So many people.

1209
00:57:59,974 --> 00:58:01,532
Half a million people a year
in the U.S.

1210
00:58:01,643 --> 00:58:03,338
That, there's no data
to support that.

1211
00:58:03,444 --> 00:58:05,571
Nick... you're not on TV anymore.

1212
00:58:08,983 --> 00:58:10,678
Okay,Joey, it's your turn.

1213
00:58:13,288 --> 00:58:14,550
Hey!

1214
00:58:14,656 --> 00:58:16,055
Nick, how much doyou smoke a day?.

1215
00:58:16,157 --> 00:58:17,715
Hey, what are you doing?.

1216
00:58:17,825 --> 00:58:20,089
According to the box,
each one ofthose patches

1217
00:58:20,194 --> 00:58:22,355
contains 21 milligrams of nicotine.

1218
00:58:22,463 --> 00:58:23,430
That's, like, what?.

1219
00:58:23,531 --> 00:58:24,930
One pack?.

1220
00:58:25,033 --> 00:58:27,331
Our industry has been working
hand in hand with...

1221
00:58:27,435 --> 00:58:29,369
Nick! Just listen, all right?.

1222
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:31,028
What makes America
the best government?.

1223
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:33,437
The passion that doesn't exist
anywhere in the world.

1224
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:35,441
Says here there are
many adverse reactions

1225
00:58:35,543 --> 00:58:36,601
from those things.

1226
00:58:36,711 --> 00:58:38,611
Let's see, "arrhythmia,

1227
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:40,180
"constipation, dyspepsia,

1228
00:58:40,281 --> 00:58:42,806
- "nausea...
- My industry does $48 billion in revenue.

1229
00:58:42,917 --> 00:58:44,612
pharyngitis, sinusitis..."

1230
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:47,552
Sureyou can call it capitalism,
a free market,

1231
00:58:47,655 --> 00:58:49,282
a celebration oftariffbreakdowns...

1232
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:52,052
"dysmenorrhea..."

1233
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,128
I don't even want to know
what that means.

1234
00:58:54,228 --> 00:58:55,991
Hey, look, I guess you could
start by, you know,

1235
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:57,894
asking for five million,
working yourway up from there.

1236
00:58:57,999 --> 00:58:59,432
But I don't want any money, Nick.

1237
00:58:59,534 --> 00:59:00,466
Well, what doyou want?.

1238
00:59:00,568 --> 00:59:01,865
I mean, I'm all ears here.

1239
00:59:01,969 --> 00:59:05,097
I have anotherword for it-

1240
00:59:05,206 --> 00:59:06,434
Iove.

1241
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:08,168
What does any man want?.

1242
00:59:08,276 --> 00:59:09,834
The love of a woman,

1243
00:59:09,944 --> 00:59:11,138
crisp bacon...

1244
00:59:11,245 --> 00:59:16,114
an average life span over 80 years.

1245
00:59:16,217 --> 00:59:18,583
Oh, Nick...

1246
00:59:18,686 --> 00:59:20,654
( filteredapplause )

1247
00:59:20,755 --> 00:59:22,814
...you don't look so good.

1248
00:59:29,831 --> 00:59:31,594
WOMAN:
lfyou shouldsmellsmoke,

1249
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:34,167
please dialzero for the operator.

1250
00:59:34,268 --> 00:59:38,398
Before leaving the room,
check the door for heat.

1251
00:59:38,506 --> 00:59:41,168
Findyour nearest
emergency exit,

1252
00:59:41,275 --> 00:59:45,336
then soak a washcloth
and coveryour nose and mouth.

1253
00:59:46,714 --> 00:59:48,909
Do not remove your washcloth.

1254
00:59:49,016 --> 00:59:52,782
Try at all times to avoid
breathing in the smoke.

1255
00:59:52,887 --> 00:59:56,152
Ifnecessary, crawl on
your hands and knees

1256
00:59:56,257 --> 00:59:58,555
to avoid the inhalation ofsmoke.

1257
00:59:58,659 --> 01:00:00,354
Do not be alarmed.

1258
01:00:00,461 --> 01:00:02,759
There are still
no conclusive studies

1259
01:00:02,864 --> 01:00:05,594
that link smoking to emphysema.

1260
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,133
( machine beeping )

1261
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,165
( monotone ) : You woke up.

1262
01:00:14,275 --> 01:00:16,436
N I CK:
Perhaps a bad choice ofinflection.

1263
01:00:16,544 --> 01:00:20,207
Is she implying that l
could've just as easily not?

1264
01:00:31,426 --> 01:00:32,620
I was so scared.

1265
01:00:32,727 --> 01:00:33,989
Hey, J oey.

1266
01:00:34,095 --> 01:00:35,494
( sighs heavily )

1267
01:00:35,596 --> 01:00:36,858
What happened?.

1268
01:00:36,964 --> 01:00:39,694
No nonsmoker
could've ever withstood

1269
01:00:39,801 --> 01:00:41,792
the amount of nicotine
you had in your bloodstream.

1270
01:00:41,903 --> 01:00:43,871
Hate to say it, but...

1271
01:00:43,971 --> 01:00:46,531
cigarettes saved your life.

1272
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,334
Can I quoteyou on that, doc?.

1273
01:00:50,445 --> 01:00:52,709
You're a real trooper, my boy.

1274
01:00:52,814 --> 01:00:54,645
Hey, Captain,

1275
01:00:54,749 --> 01:00:56,080
where are you?.

1276
01:00:56,184 --> 01:00:57,913
Winston-Salem General.

1277
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,854
Damn heart failing me again.

1278
01:01:01,956 --> 01:01:03,685
I thought we could be roommates.

1279
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:05,019
Nick, before
we get sidetracked,

1280
01:01:05,126 --> 01:01:06,821
there is one thing.

1281
01:01:06,928 --> 01:01:09,419
All right, don't get
all dramatic on me, doc.

1282
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,555
You can't smoke.

1283
01:01:15,336 --> 01:01:16,394
That's no problem.

1284
01:01:16,504 --> 01:01:18,028
I've quit before.

1285
01:01:18,139 --> 01:01:20,039
I did during the pregnancy.

1286
01:01:20,141 --> 01:01:21,199
How long, you think?.

1287
01:01:21,309 --> 01:01:23,368
I don't thinkyou understand.

1288
01:01:23,478 --> 01:01:26,038
It's a miracleyou came
out ofthis alive.

1289
01:01:26,147 --> 01:01:27,739
Any smoking-one cigarette-

1290
01:01:27,849 --> 01:01:29,942
could putyou right back
into a paralytic state.

1291
01:01:30,051 --> 01:01:32,645
Your bodyjust can't handle it.

1292
01:01:37,959 --> 01:01:39,950
Nick, I don't want to put
any more pressure on you,

1293
01:01:40,061 --> 01:01:41,892
but we got a camera crew
waiting out there.

1294
01:01:41,996 --> 01:01:44,021
Ifwe want to make
the evening news...

1295
01:01:44,131 --> 01:01:46,691
You want to unhook me here?.

1296
01:01:46,801 --> 01:01:50,703
This just goes to prove what
I've been saying for so long.

1297
01:01:50,805 --> 01:01:54,935
These nicotine patches
are just deadly.

1298
01:01:55,042 --> 01:01:56,805
Smoking saved my life.

1299
01:01:56,911 --> 01:01:59,505
Considering your condition,
will you still be able to appear

1300
01:01:59,614 --> 01:02:01,673
before Senator Finistirre's
subcommittee hearing

1301
01:02:01,782 --> 01:02:03,807
on the usage of poison labels
on cigarette packaging?.

1302
01:02:03,918 --> 01:02:05,510
Oh, I think now more than ever

1303
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,451
it is imperative that I be there.

1304
01:02:07,555 --> 01:02:09,580
Nothing will keep me from testifying.

1305
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:12,750
Fucking kidnapping.

1306
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:14,259
I don't understand, sir.

1307
01:02:14,362 --> 01:02:17,627
Aren't we considering
the kidnapping a good thing?.

1308
01:02:17,732 --> 01:02:19,393
Well, he didn't die.

1309
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,832
Hewas almost killed, sir.

1310
01:02:21,936 --> 01:02:23,096
That's the point.

1311
01:02:23,204 --> 01:02:25,297
Now he looks like a victim,
lucky bastard.

1312
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:29,335
Theway I heard it,
D.C. police found you naked

1313
01:02:29,443 --> 01:02:31,104
Iaying in Lincoln's crotch

1314
01:02:31,212 --> 01:02:34,909
coveredin nicotine patches
with a sign acrossyour chest

1315
01:02:35,016 --> 01:02:37,507
- that said...
- He doesn't need to hear the details.

1316
01:02:37,618 --> 01:02:39,950
It was some pretty fucked up shit.

1317
01:02:40,054 --> 01:02:41,021
Shh!

1318
01:02:41,122 --> 01:02:42,111
How are you feeling?.

1319
01:02:42,223 --> 01:02:45,556
I don't know.

1320
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,185
First time I'm thinking these
cigarettes are pretty dangerous.

1321
01:02:48,296 --> 01:02:50,264
You might be right about that.

1322
01:02:50,364 --> 01:02:51,797
What areyou doing?.

1323
01:02:53,568 --> 01:02:55,502
It may be small,
but it'll do the trick.

1324
01:02:55,603 --> 01:02:56,729
One shot, bam.

1325
01:02:56,837 --> 01:02:59,101
Listen, Nick is not
going to shoot anyone.

1326
01:02:59,206 --> 01:03:00,332
Cool.

1327
01:03:00,441 --> 01:03:01,373
Yeah, huh?.

1328
01:03:01,475 --> 01:03:02,703
I mean, uh...

1329
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,641
guns are to be treated with
respect, you understand that?.

1330
01:03:04,745 --> 01:03:06,713
You'll make a great father.

1331
01:03:06,814 --> 01:03:08,179
Thanks.

1332
01:03:10,418 --> 01:03:12,045
( applause )

1333
01:03:12,153 --> 01:03:13,643
Hey, there he is!

1334
01:03:13,754 --> 01:03:15,449
Hey, he's back!

1335
01:03:15,556 --> 01:03:16,989
Hey!

1336
01:03:17,091 --> 01:03:18,524
Welcome back.

1337
01:03:18,626 --> 01:03:20,719
- You okay?.
- Great.

1338
01:03:20,828 --> 01:03:22,557
Good, 'cause you're booked on
all the Sunday talk shows.

1339
01:03:22,663 --> 01:03:25,461
For once we got public sympathy
on our side.

1340
01:03:25,566 --> 01:03:28,228
We can start our own little
celebrityvictim tour.

1341
01:03:28,336 --> 01:03:30,702
I mean, we couldn't have planned
this thing better ourselves.

1342
01:03:30,805 --> 01:03:32,636
Oh, maybe next time
I can lose a lung.

1343
01:03:34,275 --> 01:03:36,743
Oh. Uh, I heard the, uh...

1344
01:03:36,844 --> 01:03:39,039
Heather Holloway article
is coming out tomorrow.

1345
01:03:39,146 --> 01:03:41,080
Really?.

1346
01:03:41,182 --> 01:03:42,308
Yeah, anything I should be
worried about?.

1347
01:03:42,416 --> 01:03:44,884
Uh, yeah, the Cancer Association.

1348
01:03:44,986 --> 01:03:46,351
Apparently, they have it in for us.

1349
01:03:46,454 --> 01:03:48,684
Fuckers.

1350
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,067
What?.

1351
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:02,829
I got a call from the paper.

1352
01:04:02,937 --> 01:04:05,098
Really?.
What'd theywant?.

1353
01:04:05,206 --> 01:04:08,266
Theywanted the correct spelling
of my name and job title.

1354
01:04:08,376 --> 01:04:10,207
You didn't tell her
about us, did you?.

1355
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:11,972
Who?.

1356
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:13,273
Heather?.

1357
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:15,246
No.

1358
01:04:17,018 --> 01:04:19,213
I mean, maybe in passing, I...

1359
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,947
In passing.

1360
01:04:21,055 --> 01:04:22,283
Oh, God, he fucked her.

1361
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:23,755
I tried to warn you.

1362
01:04:23,858 --> 01:04:26,292
Hey, he didn't fuck her.
You didn't fuck her, did you?.

1363
01:04:28,729 --> 01:04:30,196
When?.

1364
01:04:30,297 --> 01:04:31,229
In passing.

1365
01:04:31,332 --> 01:04:32,458
Look, she's a really nice girl.

1366
01:04:32,566 --> 01:04:33,590
Oh, God.

01:04:33,701 --> 01:04:35,692

01:06:58,913 --> 01:06:59,880
Bitch.

1411
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:01,038
Whore.

1412
01:07:01,148 --> 01:07:04,379
You should have been
more careful, Nick.

1413
01:07:04,485 --> 01:07:07,283
You've destroyed all the good
will created byyour kidnapping.

1414
01:07:07,388 --> 01:07:08,685
Well, we'll work up a rebuttal.

1415
01:07:08,789 --> 01:07:11,519
Heather Holloway isn't
the only reporter in town.

1416
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:12,785
No, there isn't going
to be any rebuttal.

1417
01:07:12,893 --> 01:07:13,951
What doyou mean?.

1418
01:07:14,061 --> 01:07:15,392
Don't talk to anyone.

1419
01:07:15,496 --> 01:07:17,259
We're pulling you
from the congressional hearing.

1420
01:07:17,364 --> 01:07:18,922
No, no, no. You can't pull me
from the congressional hearing.

1421
01:07:19,033 --> 01:07:20,364
All you'll be doing is giving
credence to her article.

1422
01:07:20,467 --> 01:07:21,695
I'm readyto testify.

1423
01:07:21,802 --> 01:07:23,463
Look, Nick, half of myjob
is damage control.

1424
01:07:23,571 --> 01:07:24,663
Today, that consists

1425
01:07:24,772 --> 01:07:27,400
of distancing ourselves
from you entirely-

1426
01:07:27,508 --> 01:07:31,239
Ietting you take
all the heat on this article.

1427
01:07:31,345 --> 01:07:33,074
Yourjob relied on your ability
to keep secrets

1428
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:34,272
and spin the truth.

1429
01:07:34,381 --> 01:07:36,076
I just cannot imagine a way

1430
01:07:36,183 --> 01:07:37,810
in which you could have fucked
up more.

1431
01:07:37,918 --> 01:07:40,751
There's just no way I could
possibly keepyou on staff.

1432
01:07:40,855 --> 01:07:42,652
Then I assumeyou've run this
by the captain.

1433
01:07:42,756 --> 01:07:44,690
Captain died this morning.

Mr. Naylor, this is Special

1445
01:08:56,764 --> 01:08:59,426
Having not found any leads in
your kidnapping investigation,

1446
01:08:59,533 --> 01:09:00,830
we 're going to be
handing over the case

1447
01:09:00,935 --> 01:09:01,993

1448
01:09:02,102 --> 01:09:04,297

in the future

about the fact

01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:18,113
thatyou two couldn't find
a project to work on.

He's reallyjust... I don't know.

1456
01:09:20,454 --> 01:09:22,217
So, listen,
but we should hang, at least,

1457
01:09:22,323 --> 01:09:24,291
so you drop me a line
wheneveryou're in town.

01:09:54,588 --> 01:09:56,351
No.

1468
01:09:56,457 --> 01:09:59,426
I brought someone
who needs to talk to you.

1469
01:10:04,631 --> 01:10:05,928
Hey, buddy.

1470
01:10:06,033 --> 01:10:07,967
Hey, Dad.

1471
01:10:08,068 --> 01:10:10,093
Coke in the fridge.

1472
01:10:16,543 --> 01:10:21,310
So, this Heather Holloway,
she must have been pretty hot.

1473
01:10:21,415 --> 01:10:24,316
Yes. She's pretty hot.

1474
01:10:24,418 --> 01:10:26,443
Don't take it so hard.

1475
01:10:26,553 --> 01:10:29,181
A few flaws can be appealing.

1476
01:10:29,289 --> 01:10:30,381
Makes you human.

1477
01:10:30,491 --> 01:10:31,924
Who wants to be human?.

1478
01:10:32,026 --> 01:10:33,391
Well, I know one person

1479
01:10:33,494 --> 01:10:36,463
who still thinks you're a God.

1480
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:55,676
Why did you tell that reporter
all your secrets?.

1481
01:10:58,919 --> 01:11:01,547
You're tooyoung to understand.

1482
01:11:01,655 --> 01:11:04,749
Mom says it's because
you have dependency issues

1483
01:11:04,858 --> 01:11:06,348
and it was all just
a matter oftime

1484
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:08,621
beforeyou threw it all away
on some tramp.

1485
01:11:08,729 --> 01:11:12,028
Well, that's one theory.

1486
01:11:12,132 --> 01:11:13,963
Why areyou hiding from everyone?.

1487
01:11:14,068 --> 01:11:19,665
It has something to do with
being generally hated right now.

1488
01:11:19,773 --> 01:11:21,263
But it's yourjob to be
generally hated.

1489
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:24,139
It's more complicated
than that,Joey.

1490
01:11:24,244 --> 01:11:26,508
You're just making it
more complicated

1491
01:11:26,613 --> 01:11:28,171
so thatyou can feel
sorry foryourself.

1492
01:11:28,282 --> 01:11:30,011
Likeyou always said,

1493
01:11:30,117 --> 01:11:33,416
"Ifyou want an easyjob,
go work for the Red Cross."

1494
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,147
You're a lobbyist.

1495
01:11:35,255 --> 01:11:38,349
Yourjob is to be right, and
you're the best at whatyou do.

1496
01:11:39,993 --> 01:11:41,392
You're the sultan of spin.

1497
01:11:42,596 --> 01:11:43,995
"Sultan ofspin"?.

1498
01:11:44,098 --> 01:11:45,622
Mom subscribes to Newsweek.

1499
01:11:47,067 --> 01:11:48,398
Who cares what the Brads

1500
01:11:48,502 --> 01:11:49,526
ofthe world think?.

1501
01:11:49,636 --> 01:11:50,898
He's not my dad.

1502
01:11:52,606 --> 01:11:54,073
You are.

1503
01:11:54,174 --> 01:11:57,405
NICK: Andright there,
looking intoJoey's eyes,

1504
01:11:57,511 --> 01:12:00,912
it all came back in a rush.

1505
01:12:01,014 --> 01:12:03,482
Why I do what I do-
defending the defenseless,

1506
01:12:03,584 --> 01:12:05,882
protecting the disenfranchised
corporations

1507
01:12:05,986 --> 01:12:08,045
that have been abandoned
by their very own consumers-

1508
01:12:08,155 --> 01:12:10,419
the logger...

1509
01:12:10,524 --> 01:12:12,754
the sweatshop foreman...

1510
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:14,885
the oil driller...

1511
01:12:14,995 --> 01:12:17,156
the land mine developer...

1512
01:12:17,264 --> 01:12:20,563
the baby seal poacher...

1513
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:22,066
Baby seal poacher?.

1514
01:12:22,169 --> 01:12:23,534
Even I thi nk that's kind of cruel.

1515
01:12:23,637 --> 01:12:25,730
All right, you're missing the point.

1516
01:12:25,839 --> 01:12:27,602
I must be, because I thought
you were apologizing.

1517
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:28,675
I'm getting to that.

1518
01:12:28,775 --> 01:12:30,538
When?.

1519
01:12:30,644 --> 01:12:33,112
Look.

1520
01:12:33,213 --> 01:12:38,048
The two ofyou, you're
basically my only friends,

1521
01:12:38,152 --> 01:12:40,450
and the last thing that
I would everwant to do

1522
01:12:40,554 --> 01:12:42,249
would be to hurtyou.

1523
01:12:42,356 --> 01:12:44,221
And, I can only imagine...

1524
01:12:44,324 --> 01:12:45,348
Why areyou smiling?.

1525
01:12:45,459 --> 01:12:47,120
Why is he smiling?.

1526
01:12:47,227 --> 01:12:49,320
Hewon a hundred bucks off ofyou.

1527
01:12:49,429 --> 01:12:52,455
I bet Pollyyou'd spill the beans
to that reporter.

1528
01:12:52,566 --> 01:12:55,034
That goes against everything
that we stand for.

1529
01:12:55,135 --> 01:12:57,399
Oh, please! You've ratted us out
to some reporterwith tits!

1530
01:12:57,504 --> 01:12:59,404
Glorious tits.

1531
01:12:59,506 --> 01:13:01,804
Only afteryou created a betting
pool testing my incompetence?.

1532
01:13:01,909 --> 01:13:03,968
Do you have any idea the beating
I'm taking at Moderation?.

1533
01:13:04,077 --> 01:13:06,807
Well, look, I'm sure both of
you are under a lot of scrutiny.

1534
01:13:06,914 --> 01:13:09,109
You know what?.
You can stop using the plural.

1535
01:13:09,216 --> 01:13:12,413
The guys at Safety actually liked
the name "Merchants of Death."

1536
01:13:12,519 --> 01:13:13,816
They're gonna have
some bumper stickers made up.

1537
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:15,821
I'll make sureyou get one.

1538
01:13:15,923 --> 01:13:17,857
Thankyou.

1539
01:13:20,027 --> 01:13:21,858
That is disgusting.

1540
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:24,959
It's American.

1541
01:13:25,065 --> 01:13:26,623
Can I have a bite?.

1542
01:13:26,733 --> 01:13:28,257
Mmm.

1543
01:13:28,368 --> 01:13:30,427
So I guess this means

1544
01:13:30,537 --> 01:13:33,768
you won't be appearing
at Finistirre's subcommittee.

1545
01:13:33,874 --> 01:13:36,104
Hmm. I was kind oflooking
forward to it, too.

1546
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,974
It's kind of cool in
a JimmyStewart sort ofway.

1547
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:41,604
More like an Ollie North sort ofway.

1548
01:13:41,715 --> 01:13:43,945
Finistirre would have
torn you a new asshole

1549
01:13:44,051 --> 01:13:45,575
in a House of Parliament, no less.

1550
01:13:45,686 --> 01:13:46,983
I could have taken him.

1551
01:13:47,087 --> 01:13:48,748
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?. What would you have said?.

1552
01:13:48,855 --> 01:13:50,083
I don't know.

1553
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:53,421
I'd just like him to feel
immeasurable pain,

1554
01:13:53,527 --> 01:13:54,994
humiliation.

1555
01:13:55,095 --> 01:13:56,562
Yeah, well, thatwould be
kind oftough.

1556
01:13:56,663 --> 01:13:58,028
I mean, he's already a Senator.

1557
01:13:58,131 --> 01:13:59,860
( chuckles )

1558
01:13:59,967 --> 01:14:02,162
I mean, howwould you get
back in even ifyou wanted to?.

1559
01:14:06,206 --> 01:14:07,366
Uh-oh.

1560
01:14:13,313 --> 01:14:14,610
You're not gonna like this.

1561
01:14:14,715 --> 01:14:17,616
( reporters clamoring )

1562
01:14:17,718 --> 01:14:18,844
Hello.
Thanks very much for coming.

1563
01:14:18,952 --> 01:14:21,284
First of all, I'd like to say
a few words

1564
01:14:21,388 --> 01:14:22,514
to all the people who
are mentioned

1565
01:14:22,623 --> 01:14:24,682
in the recent newspaper article.

1566
01:14:24,791 --> 01:14:26,281
Please take comfort in knowing

1567
01:14:26,393 --> 01:14:30,159
that I will not rest until
your names are cleared.

1568
01:14:30,264 --> 01:14:32,357
This experience has taught me
an important lesson-

1569
01:14:32,466 --> 01:14:34,263
having sexual affairs
with members ofthe press

1570
01:14:34,368 --> 01:14:35,858
is just unfair.

1571
01:14:35,969 --> 01:14:37,800
It's not unfair to me, mind you,

1572
01:14:37,904 --> 01:14:41,362
but to all the people in my life
whose only crime is knowing me.

1573
01:14:41,475 --> 01:14:44,672
It was your names, not mine,
that suffered

1574
01:14:44,778 --> 01:14:47,303
from a meaningless affair
with a seductress

1575
01:14:47,414 --> 01:14:50,872
in the form ofa young
brunette Washington reporter

1576
01:14:50,984 --> 01:14:52,542
whose name I won't mention

1577
01:14:52,653 --> 01:14:54,587
because I have dignity.

1578
01:14:54,688 --> 01:14:56,383
( reporters clamoring )

1579
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:57,514
Mr. Naylor!

1580
01:14:57,624 --> 01:14:59,421
Are you still planning
on testifying

1581
01:14:59,526 --> 01:15:01,619
at tomorrow's subcommittee
hearing on tobacco?.

1582
01:15:01,728 --> 01:15:03,992
I'm glad you asked that question.

1583
01:15:04,097 --> 01:15:05,860
There have been wide accusations of me
dropping out oftomorrow's hearing.

1584
01:15:05,966 --> 01:15:07,194
Let it be known

1585
01:15:07,301 --> 01:15:09,030
that unless Senator Finistirre
has withdrawn my invitation

1586
01:15:09,136 --> 01:15:10,569
- to speak, it is my plan
- It's called a subpoena.

1587
01:15:10,671 --> 01:15:12,502
to be in Congress tomorrow
to share my knowledge

1588
01:15:12,606 --> 01:15:14,870
ofbig tobacco and all those
who enjoy its products.

1589
01:15:14,975 --> 01:15:16,237
Thankyou very much.
I'll seeyou tomorrow.

1590
01:15:16,343 --> 01:15:17,935
( all clamoring )

1591
01:15:18,045 --> 01:15:20,013
( TVshuts off)

1592
01:15:20,113 --> 01:15:21,307
( phone rings )

1593
01:15:23,016 --> 01:15:26,247
( cacophony ofphones ringing )

1594
01:16:10,897 --> 01:16:13,457
( indistinct, distorted
roaring and shutters clicking )

1595
01:16:15,902 --> 01:16:18,496
Sti I l feel I i ke J i m my Stewart?.

1596
01:16:29,516 --> 01:16:30,505
Good.

1597
01:16:31,818 --> 01:16:34,844
( beeping )

1598
01:16:37,023 --> 01:16:38,490
( electronic squealing )

1599
01:16:38,592 --> 01:16:39,684
Why don't you al I go ahead?.

1600
01:16:39,793 --> 01:16:41,317
This could be a while.

1601
01:16:44,398 --> 01:16:46,093
( electronic squealing
continues )

1602
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:51,227
Ifwe could, um... ifwe could
take our seats, please.

1603
01:16:52,572 --> 01:16:53,869
( clears throat )

1604
01:16:53,974 --> 01:16:56,534
Gentlemen, ladies.

1605
01:16:56,643 --> 01:16:59,373
If I may call this meeting to order.

1606
01:16:59,479 --> 01:17:04,246
We'll do everything we can to
keep things brief and concise

1607
01:17:04,351 --> 01:17:05,875
so that we can all
get out ofhere on time.

1608
01:17:05,986 --> 01:17:09,478
The skull and crossbones
means one thing:

1609
01:17:09,589 --> 01:17:11,056
Poison.

1610
01:17:11,158 --> 01:17:13,854
Thus, the message is quite clear.

1611
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,121
Like any other product
that carries the branding,

1612
01:17:16,229 --> 01:17:19,460
ifyou take it, you will die.

1613
01:17:19,566 --> 01:17:22,626
Yes, but isn't this overkill?.

1614
01:17:22,736 --> 01:17:26,001
Why don't we just use words,
as we currently do?.

1615
01:17:26,106 --> 01:17:29,906
Something that describes the
dangers of cigarette smoking.

1616
01:17:30,010 --> 01:17:31,034
Well, the American public
is not affected

1617
01:17:31,144 --> 01:17:32,611
by masthead anymore.

1618
01:17:32,712 --> 01:17:33,872
They need images.

1619
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:36,346
We've done studies
which show that consumers react

1620
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:39,010
up to 80%%% more to imagery
rather than words.

1621
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:40,416
The stats are there.

1622
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,317
It's just sad

1623
01:17:42,422 --> 01:17:44,754
that the Academy ofTobacco
Studies did not release

1624
01:17:44,858 --> 01:17:46,257
this type ofinformation earlier.

1625
01:17:46,359 --> 01:17:49,328
When you say
the Academy ofTobacco Studies,

1626
01:17:49,429 --> 01:17:50,760
you're referring to...

1627
01:17:50,864 --> 01:17:51,990
Yes.

1628
01:17:52,098 --> 01:17:53,827
to the coalition...

1629
01:17:53,934 --> 01:17:54,866
Yes, the coalition.

1630
01:17:54,968 --> 01:17:56,560
The big... big tobacco...

1631
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:57,932
...that is represented by...

1632
01:17:58,038 --> 01:17:59,266
By, um...

1633
01:17:59,372 --> 01:18:00,498
And specifically

1634
01:18:00,607 --> 01:18:01,505
Mr...

1635
01:18:01,608 --> 01:18:02,666
Um...

1636
01:18:02,776 --> 01:18:04,368
Mr., uh, Nick Naylor.

1637
01:18:04,478 --> 01:18:05,376
Nick Naylor?.

1638
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:06,446
Thankyou very much.

1639
01:18:08,448 --> 01:18:09,346
WITNESS:
The current use

1640
01:18:09,449 --> 01:18:11,076
ofwords instead of imagery

1641
01:18:11,184 --> 01:18:14,779
is an obvious move against
the non-English-speaking population

1642
01:18:14,888 --> 01:18:16,355
ofthe United States.

1643
01:18:16,456 --> 01:18:18,583
The skull and crossbones

1644
01:18:18,692 --> 01:18:22,059
speak loudly in all languages.

1645
01:18:22,162 --> 01:18:24,756
By not using it,
they're saying

1646
01:18:24,865 --> 01:18:28,892
theywant those who can't
read English to die.

1647
01:18:29,002 --> 01:18:30,765
Hmm. Senor Herrera,

1648
01:18:30,871 --> 01:18:33,704
could you clarify "they"?.

1649
01:18:33,807 --> 01:18:35,104
NICK:
Let it be known,

1650
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:37,676
the public beating
has not gone out ofstyle.

1651
01:18:45,018 --> 01:18:47,179
Nick Naylor, please step forward.

1652
01:18:56,897 --> 01:18:59,525
You go sit with him.

1653
01:19:07,908 --> 01:19:10,900
Please state your name,
address and current occupation.

1654
01:19:11,011 --> 01:19:12,137
My name is Nick Naylor.

1655
01:19:12,245 --> 01:19:14,008
I live at 6000
Massachusetts Avenue

1656
01:19:14,114 --> 01:19:16,014
and I am currently unemployed,

1657
01:19:16,116 --> 01:19:18,243
but until recently,
I was the vice president

1658
01:19:18,351 --> 01:19:19,841
ofthe Academy ofTobacco Studies.

1659
01:19:19,953 --> 01:19:20,851
Mr. Naylor,

1660
01:19:20,954 --> 01:19:24,412
as vice president
ofthe Academy

1661
01:19:24,524 --> 01:19:26,492
ofTobacco Studies,
what was required ofyou?.

1662
01:19:26,593 --> 01:19:27,821
What did you do?.

1663
01:19:27,928 --> 01:19:31,420
I informed the public
of all the research performed

1664
01:19:31,531 --> 01:19:33,522
in the investigation
on the effects oftobacco.

1665
01:19:33,633 --> 01:19:34,759
Mm-hmm,
and what,

1666
01:19:34,868 --> 01:19:37,428
so far,
has the Academy concluded

1667
01:19:37,537 --> 01:19:39,971
in their investigation
into the effects oftobacco?.

1668
01:19:40,073 --> 01:19:42,337
Well, many things, actually.

1669
01:19:42,442 --> 01:19:44,205
Why,just the other day
they uncovered evidence

1670
01:19:44,311 --> 01:19:46,142
that smoking can offset
Parkinson's disease.

1671
01:19:46,246 --> 01:19:47,975
( amusedbuzz )

1672
01:19:48,081 --> 01:19:49,309
I'm sure the health
community

1673
01:19:49,416 --> 01:19:50,542
is thrilled.

1674
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:53,551
Mr. Naylor, who provides
the financial backing

1675
01:19:53,653 --> 01:19:55,621
for the Academy ofTobacco Studies?.

1676
01:19:55,722 --> 01:19:58,987
Uh... Conglomerated Tobacco.

1677
01:19:59,092 --> 01:20:00,787
That's the cigarette companies.

1678
01:20:00,894 --> 01:20:02,953
For the most part, yes.

1679
01:20:03,063 --> 01:20:05,964
Doyou think that...

1680
01:20:06,066 --> 01:20:08,034
might affect their priorities?.

1681
01:20:08,134 --> 01:20:09,465
No,just as I'm sure

1682
01:20:09,569 --> 01:20:11,400
campaign contributions
don't affectyours.

1683
01:20:11,504 --> 01:20:12,528
Ohh.

1684
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,402
( alllaughing )

1685
01:20:14,507 --> 01:20:17,738
Senators, Mr. Naylor is not here
to testify on the goings-on

1686
01:20:17,844 --> 01:20:19,641
ofthe Academy ofTobacco Studies.

1687
01:20:19,746 --> 01:20:21,805
We're here to examine
the possibility

1688
01:20:21,915 --> 01:20:23,314
of a warning logo on cigarettes.

1689
01:20:23,416 --> 01:20:24,383
Now, Mr. Naylor,

1690
01:20:24,484 --> 01:20:26,008
I have to askyou,
out offormality,

1691
01:20:26,119 --> 01:20:28,087
doyou believe that smoking
cigarettes, over time,

1692
01:20:28,188 --> 01:20:31,419
can lead to lung cancer and
other respiratory conditions

1693
01:20:31,524 --> 01:20:32,718
such as emphysema?.

1694
01:20:34,594 --> 01:20:36,084
Yes.

1695
01:20:38,932 --> 01:20:39,830
In fact, I thinkyou'd be
hard-pressed

1696
01:20:39,933 --> 01:20:41,025
to find someone
who really believes

1697
01:20:41,134 --> 01:20:43,102
that cigarettes are not
potentially harmful.

1698
01:20:43,203 --> 01:20:45,433
I mean, show ofhands,
who out here thinks

1699
01:20:45,538 --> 01:20:47,028
- that cigarettes aren't dangerous...
- Mr. Naylor.

1700
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:50,268
There's no need for theatrics.

1701
01:20:50,377 --> 01:20:52,937
Sir, I just don't see the point in a warning
label for something people already know.

1702
01:20:53,046 --> 01:20:54,343
The warning symbol

1703
01:20:54,447 --> 01:20:58,076
is a reminder, a reminder ofthe
dangers ofsmoking cigarettes.

1704
01:20:58,184 --> 01:21:00,015
Well, ifwewant to remind
people of danger,

1705
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,644
why don'twe slap
a skull and crossbones

1706
01:21:01,755 --> 01:21:02,722
on all Boeing airplanes,

1707
01:21:02,822 --> 01:21:04,255
Senator Lothridge?.

1708
01:21:04,357 --> 01:21:05,289
And all Fords, Senator Dupree?.

1709
01:21:05,392 --> 01:21:07,724
That is ridiculous.

1710
01:21:07,827 --> 01:21:10,125
The death toll from airline
and automobile accidents

1711
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:12,289
doesn't even skim the surface
of cigarettes.

1712
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:13,457
They don't even compare.

1713
01:21:13,566 --> 01:21:15,625
Oh, this from a senator
who calls Vermont home.

1714
01:21:15,735 --> 01:21:17,862
I don't followyou, Mr. Naylor.

1715
01:21:17,971 --> 01:21:19,632
Well, the real

1716
01:21:19,739 --> 01:21:22,299
demonstrated number one killer
in America is cholesterol,

1717
01:21:22,409 --> 01:21:23,398
and here comes
Senator Finistirre,

1718
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:25,740
whose fine state is,
I regret to say,

1719
01:21:25,845 --> 01:21:28,871
clogging the nation's arteries
with Vermont cheddar cheese.

1720
01:21:28,982 --> 01:21:30,415
( audience murmuring )

1721
01:21:30,517 --> 01:21:33,247
Ifwe want to talk numbers,
how about the millions of people

1722
01:21:33,353 --> 01:21:34,320
dying ofheart attacks.

1723
01:21:34,421 --> 01:21:35,683
Perhaps Vermont cheddar

1724
01:21:35,789 --> 01:21:38,155
should come
with a skull and crossbones.

1725
01:21:38,258 --> 01:21:40,089
That is lud...

1726
01:21:40,193 --> 01:21:41,160
The great state ofVermont

1727
01:21:41,261 --> 01:21:42,819
will not apologize for its cheese.

1728
01:21:42,929 --> 01:21:43,896
Mr. Naylor,

1729
01:21:43,997 --> 01:21:45,487
we are here to discuss cigarettes.

1730
01:21:45,598 --> 01:21:49,227
Not planes, not cars- cigarettes.

1731
01:21:49,335 --> 01:21:51,997
Now, as we discussed earlier,
these warning labels

1732
01:21:52,105 --> 01:21:55,302
are not for those who know, but
rather for those who don't know.

1733
01:21:55,408 --> 01:21:57,171
( sighs )

1734
01:21:57,277 --> 01:21:59,268
What about the children?.

1735
01:21:59,379 --> 01:22:01,404
Gentlemen...

1736
01:22:01,514 --> 01:22:03,448
it's called education.

1737
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:05,415
It doesn't come offthe side
of a cigarette carton.

1738
01:22:05,518 --> 01:22:06,576
It comes from our teachers,

1739
01:22:06,686 --> 01:22:08,745
and more importantly, our parents.

1740
01:22:08,855 --> 01:22:11,983
It is the job
of every parent

1741
01:22:12,092 --> 01:22:15,721
to warn their children of all
the dangers ofthe world,

1742
01:22:15,829 --> 01:22:18,389
including cigarettes, so that
one day, when they get older,

1743
01:22:18,498 --> 01:22:20,329
they can choose for themselves.

1744
01:22:22,569 --> 01:22:25,732
I look at my... son

1745
01:22:25,839 --> 01:22:27,238
who...

1746
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:29,171
was kind enough
to come with me today,

1747
01:22:29,275 --> 01:22:31,766
and I can't help but think

1748
01:22:31,878 --> 01:22:34,142
that I am responsible
for his growth

1749
01:22:34,247 --> 01:22:36,374
and his development.

1750
01:22:36,483 --> 01:22:38,007
And I'm proud ofthat.

1751
01:22:38,118 --> 01:22:39,380
Well, having
said that,

1752
01:22:39,486 --> 01:22:42,046
would you condone him smoking?.

1753
01:22:42,155 --> 01:22:44,487
Well, of course not.
He's not 1 8.

1754
01:22:44,591 --> 01:22:45,649
That would be illegal.

1755
01:22:45,759 --> 01:22:46,817
( chuckling )

1756
01:22:46,926 --> 01:22:49,019
Yes, I-I heard you deliver
that line on 20-20,

1757
01:22:49,129 --> 01:22:50,494
but enough dancing.

1758
01:22:50,597 --> 01:22:52,929
What areyou going to do
when he turns 1 8?.

1759
01:22:54,601 --> 01:22:56,159
Come on, Mr. Naylor.

1760
01:22:56,269 --> 01:22:59,830
On his 1 8th birthday, will
you share a cigarette with him?.

1761
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:02,169
Will you spend
a lovely afternoon,

1762
01:23:02,275 --> 01:23:04,436
Iike one ofyour ludicrous
cigarette advertisements?.

1763
01:23:04,544 --> 01:23:06,068
You seem to have a lot to say

1764
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:07,510
about how we
should raise our children.

1765
01:23:07,614 --> 01:23:08,581
What ofyour own?.

1766
01:23:08,681 --> 01:23:11,149
What areyou
going to do

1767
01:23:11,251 --> 01:23:13,549
when he turns 1 8?.

1768
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:23,823
Ifhe reallywants a cigarette,
I'll buy him his first pack.

1769
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:25,454
( audience mutters softly)

1770
01:23:28,568 --> 01:23:31,401
Thankyou foryour testimony,
Mr. Naylor. You're excused.

1771
01:23:38,244 --> 01:23:39,677
I'll meetyou outside, okay?.

1772
01:23:52,258 --> 01:23:53,816
Great.

1773
01:23:53,927 --> 01:23:55,053
Well done, my boy.

1774
01:23:55,161 --> 01:23:57,288
Were you in the same room as me?.

1775
01:23:57,397 --> 01:23:58,489
The whole personal choice thing?.

1776
01:23:58,598 --> 01:23:59,724
They ate that shit up.

1777
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:01,664
( laughing ):
Just checked the whip count.

1778
01:24:01,768 --> 01:24:03,167
That bill is going down in flames.

1779
01:24:03,269 --> 01:24:06,102
Your speech was unorthodox,
butyou did it, boy.

1780
01:24:06,206 --> 01:24:07,104
You crushed the fucker.

1781
01:24:07,207 --> 01:24:08,333
That's good news foryou guys.

1782
01:24:08,441 --> 01:24:09,840
Oh. Whoa, whoa.

1783
01:24:09,943 --> 01:24:12,844
We're still a team, right?.

1784
01:24:12,946 --> 01:24:14,914
What about damage control?.

1785
01:24:16,416 --> 01:24:17,781
Look, Nick.

1786
01:24:17,884 --> 01:24:21,479
Winston-Salem is ready
to do whatever it takes

1787
01:24:21,588 --> 01:24:23,112
to keepyou onboard.

1788
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:31,257
( crowdclamoring )

1789
01:24:31,364 --> 01:24:34,424
Nick, will you continue
fighting for cigarettes?.

1790
01:24:34,534 --> 01:24:35,865
Of course he will.

1791
01:24:35,969 --> 01:24:37,937
This man here is our general.

1792
01:24:38,037 --> 01:24:39,800
We're not just gonna let him retire.

1793
01:24:39,906 --> 01:24:40,930
REPORTER:
Is that correct, Nick?.

1794
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,530
You're sticking with tobacco?.

1795
01:24:46,579 --> 01:24:50,071
NICK: Now, I know what
you're probablythinking.

1796
01:24:50,183 --> 01:24:51,343
What a great opportunityfor me

1797
01:24:51,451 --> 01:24:53,043
to teachJoey
how to use leverage against

1798
01:24:53,152 --> 01:24:54,744
a backstabbing boss.

1799
01:24:54,854 --> 01:24:58,290
But I actually meant what
I said about responsibility.

1800
01:24:58,391 --> 01:25:02,020
Some things
are just more important

1801
01:25:02,128 --> 01:25:03,288
than paying a mortgage.

1802
01:25:03,396 --> 01:25:05,990
So I did the only responsible
thing I could.

1803
01:25:06,099 --> 01:25:08,863
I turned down the job.

1804
01:25:08,968 --> 01:25:11,300
And my timing
couldn 't have been better.

1805
01:25:11,404 --> 01:25:13,702
Within a few months,
the cigarette companies

1806
01:25:13,806 --> 01:25:15,205
settled
with the American smoker

1807
01:25:15,308 --> 01:25:17,970
to the tune of$246 billion.

1808
01:25:19,145 --> 01:25:21,477
And the Academy
ofTobacco Studies

1809
01:25:21,581 --> 01:25:23,344
was permanently dismantled.

1810
01:25:23,449 --> 01:25:25,747
For the first time in decades,

1811
01:25:25,852 --> 01:25:27,547
BR found himselfout ofwork.

1812
01:25:29,322 --> 01:25:31,415
therwise, not much has changed.

1813
01:25:31,524 --> 01:25:33,685
The MD squad still meets every week.

1814
01:25:33,793 --> 01:25:35,090
N ice.

1815
01:25:35,194 --> 01:25:37,458
We even added a few new members.

1816
01:25:37,563 --> 01:25:40,361
The thi ngs I could learn
from you, Bobby J ay.

1817
01:25:40,466 --> 01:25:41,455
POLLY: Right.

1818
01:25:41,567 --> 01:25:43,000
BOBBY JAY:
Stick around. Stick around.

1819
01:25:43,102 --> 01:25:45,832
Senator Finistirre is still
fighting forhis causes.

1820
01:25:45,939 --> 01:25:47,702
What do you say
to the people who claim

1821
01:25:47,807 --> 01:25:49,741
you are destroying cinema classics?.

1822
01:25:49,842 --> 01:25:51,469
Mmm, no. All
we're doing

1823
01:25:51,577 --> 01:25:53,238
is using
digital technology

1824
01:25:53,346 --> 01:25:56,509
to tastefully update
movies ofthe past...

1825
01:25:56,616 --> 01:25:58,174
by removing cigarettes.

1826
01:25:58,284 --> 01:26:01,515
I believe that ifthese
stars were alive today,

1827
01:26:01,621 --> 01:26:04,055
they would agree that
we're doing the right thing.

1828
01:26:04,157 --> 01:26:05,886
But, in essence, aren't
you changing history?.

1829
01:26:05,992 --> 01:26:09,928
No, I think we're improving history.

1830
01:26:11,798 --> 01:26:13,129
Even Heatheris still reporting.

1831
01:26:13,232 --> 01:26:14,597
The whole town has been evacuated.

1832
01:26:14,701 --> 01:26:20,003
They're calling this
the storm of the century.

1833
01:26:20,106 --> 01:26:21,437
Not much changes at all.

1834
01:26:21,541 --> 01:26:26,240
And this year's Foggy Bottom
Debating Society Champion is...

1835
01:26:26,346 --> 01:26:27,335
Joey Naylor.

1836
01:26:27,447 --> 01:26:28,607
- Yay!
- Yay!

1837
01:26:28,715 --> 01:26:29,613
NICK: Joey!

1838
01:26:29,716 --> 01:26:30,614
POLLY:Joey!

1839
01:26:30,717 --> 01:26:31,615
NICK: Joey,Joey!

1840
01:26:31,718 --> 01:26:33,242
That's my boy.

1841
01:26:33,353 --> 01:26:34,911
Hold it up. Hold it up.

1842
01:26:35,021 --> 01:26:36,852
( Pollywhooping )

1843
01:26:38,558 --> 01:26:40,583
Andme?

1844
01:26:40,693 --> 01:26:43,389
Well, there's still a place
forguys like me.

1845
01:26:43,496 --> 01:26:46,124
So, be straight with me.

1846
01:26:46,232 --> 01:26:48,962
Is it true?.

1847
01:26:49,068 --> 01:26:50,467
- It could be.
- Come on.

1848
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:52,663
We know ofvery few cases.

1849
01:26:52,772 --> 01:26:53,898
There's no scientific proof at all.

1850
01:26:54,007 --> 01:26:54,905
There was an unfortunate
incident out in Iowa...

1851
01:26:55,008 --> 01:26:55,975
It's really a complicated situation.

1852
01:26:56,075 --> 01:26:57,269
NICK:
Gentlemen,

1853
01:26:57,377 --> 01:26:59,971
practice these words
in front ofthe mirror.

1854
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:03,048
"Although we are constantly
exploring the subject,

1855
01:27:03,149 --> 01:27:05,845
"currently,
there is no direct evidence

1856
01:27:05,952 --> 01:27:07,351
"that links cell phone usage

1857
01:27:07,453 --> 01:27:09,318
to brain cancer."

1858

MichaelJordan plays ball.

1860
01:27:17,730 --> 01:27:19,288
Charles Manson kills people.

1861
01:27:19,399 --> 01:27:20,866
I talk.

1862
01:27:22,535 --> 01:27:23,661
Everyone has a talent.
