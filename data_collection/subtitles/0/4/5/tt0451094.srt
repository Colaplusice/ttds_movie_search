1
00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:06,329
And no one could refuse the Witch
any favours

2
00:00:06,401 --> 00:00:08,232
It has to be tonight

3
00:00:08,403 --> 00:00:10,928
I can't take it any more. Not even for you

4
00:00:11,806 --> 00:00:16,675
Soo-kyoung, a thief released before me
found out where Baek was working

5
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:20,637
Seong-eun, a smart college grad...

6
00:00:20,815 --> 00:00:22,783
...was later released and got a job
at the same place

7
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:27,281
She then informed me of Baek's
intention of getting a new car

8
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:29,581
Later, Baek was visited by

9
00:00:29,857 --> 00:00:32,223
a pretty car dealer, Park Yi-jeong

10
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:24,239
It'll be used wisely for the Lord's work

11
00:01:35,089 --> 00:01:36,056
Hello?

12
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:38,489
Darling

13
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:42,224
Have you had dinner?

14
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:45,356
I'll wait and have it with you

15
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:49,229
You can go ahead without me

16
00:01:51,272 --> 00:01:56,175
I'll wait for you, so hurry back

17
00:01:59,046 --> 00:02:02,709
He hasn't eaten yet. I'll go and make
him eat first

18
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,850
It's okay. Don't worry

19
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:06,443
Bye

20
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,691
Geum-ja

21
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:04,802
At that moment, Geum-ja held her
breath and struggled to break free

22
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:37,353
Even in this desperate situation
she never forgot the gun's firing range

23
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:22,488
Got an English-Korean dictionary?

24
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:29,893
Don't think that I forgive you

25
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:35,274
I think mothers who dump their kids
should go to jail

26
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:41,710
When I was younger, I often thought of
taking revenge out on you

27
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:47,017
But I couldn't imagine the thought of
killing you

28
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:51,881
Reason being that, I didn't know what
your face looked like

29
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:59,527
Anyway, since we're on better terms
now, give me your reasons at least

30
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:06,231
Saying sorry is not enough
You should say sorry at least 3 times

31
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:10,400
Ungenerously your daughter, Jenny

32
00:09:24,858 --> 00:09:25,722
Left turn

33
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,968
I remember when I first had you, Jenny

34
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:20,904
As you grew in me, I felt like my wallet
was getting fatter

35
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:39,458
But even before you could celebrate
your first birthday, I had to go to prison...

36
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,701
I had to give you up

37
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:52,140
You are a sweet child you'd smile your
pretty smiles to complete strangers...

38
00:10:52,346 --> 00:11:05,123
I knew anyone will be happy to have you
anyone will be able to love you

39
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:19,006
After I'm done with this man...

40
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:22,071
I'm planning to return you to Australia

41
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:36,378
My sins are too great and too deep...

42
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:41,326
for me to take care such a sweet child
like you

43
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:49,025
You're innocent, but

44
00:11:49,903 --> 00:11:57,139
but I made you grew up without
a mother...

45
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:15,384
But, also part of the punishment
I must take

46
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:23,201
Listen carefully

47
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:29,639
People make mistakes

48
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:37,682
If you commit a sin, you have to make
atonement for that sin

49
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:42,378
Atonement, do you know what
that means?

50
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:46,286
Atonement

51
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:49,894
Yes, that's it

52
00:12:50,364 --> 00:12:54,596
Big atonement for big sins...

53
00:12:54,802 --> 00:12:59,398
Small atonement for small sins

54
00:12:59,673 --> 00:13:00,697
OK?

55
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:24,096
Because he made me a sinner

56
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:44,913
This man killed a little boy...

57
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:45,942
And...

58
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,482
I helped him

59
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:28,761
I was happy...

60
00:14:30,264 --> 00:14:36,726
Too happy for a sinner

61
00:14:41,508 --> 00:14:42,736
Jenny

62
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:02,252
I'm truly sorry

63
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,769
Farewell

64
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:14,395
Get up, teacher! Time to go to work!

65
00:17:28,675 --> 00:17:34,739
Geum-ja, what's with that eye shadow?

66
00:19:12,112 --> 00:19:13,977
Do you know why those kids...

67
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:50,413
Hey! Here's another one!

68
00:19:55,822 --> 00:19:56,948
Hello?

69
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:06,890
If you'd found the real killer back then...

70
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:11,365
These children wouldn't have died, right?

71
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,870
You know how this feels

72
00:20:20,347 --> 00:20:22,144
There were four!

73
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:39,358
- I told you I can't come to work today
- It's not that...

74
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:43,797
- Someone's here looking for you
- Who?

75
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:48,238
- Well, the thing is
- They won't say who they are?

76
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:50,170
I don't know what they're saying

77
00:20:58,918 --> 00:21:01,682
Can you speak Japanese?

78
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:11,559
Mommy!

79
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:14,864
Please hurry and come get me...

80
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:18,037
Mommy...

81
00:21:18,238 --> 00:21:23,073
There, there. Don't cry. Don't cry...

82
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:03,535
Mommy... please hurry

83
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,579
Mommy, I want to go home
Please hurry, mommy

84
00:23:08,815 --> 00:23:10,908
There, there... Don't cry. Don't cry

85
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:17,112
Mommy, where are you?

86
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:30,402
I know it's difficult but take a good look
at this man

87
00:23:32,105 --> 00:23:36,337
Next is Se-hyun, killed in 1995

88
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:49,054
Dad... I can't...

89
00:23:50,023 --> 00:23:51,388
Daddy

90
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,128
This is Eun-joo, in '96

91
00:23:59,432 --> 00:24:02,162
I can't breathe...

92
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:10,741
I'm scared. Please don't kill me, sir

93
00:24:17,884 --> 00:24:19,112
Wait just a minute

94
00:24:41,274 --> 00:24:43,640
This is Yoo Jae-kyoung, 2000

95
00:24:50,283 --> 00:24:52,308
Mommy

96
00:25:37,997 --> 00:25:41,763
He was a teacher at English schools
in affluent neighbourhoods

97
00:25:42,702 --> 00:25:48,197
He'd pick his victim, kidnap and kill
them, then move on to another school

98
00:25:49,175 --> 00:25:52,303
He'd never pick a child from one of
his own classes

99
00:25:52,545 --> 00:25:53,603
Which is why he was never under
any suspicion

100
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,714
Coffee or green tea?

101
00:25:57,383 --> 00:26:02,514
Children annoyed him, so he would
tape them right after kidnapping them...

102
00:26:02,822 --> 00:26:04,813
And killed them straight away

103
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:11,225
The voices you heard on the line while
negotiating the ransom...

104
00:26:11,397 --> 00:26:15,333
...were taped off the videos
after the kids were already dead

105
00:26:19,305 --> 00:26:22,001
Now, you have two options

106
00:26:22,942 --> 00:26:25,502
If you want lawful punishment...

107
00:26:25,912 --> 00:26:29,507
We will hand him over to
Chief Choi here

108
00:26:29,782 --> 00:26:33,218
But if you want a speedier
more personalized death for him...

109
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,752
You can have it right here and now

110
00:26:36,956 --> 00:26:38,947
Does he have a child of his own?

111
00:26:40,193 --> 00:26:43,924
He is supposed to be sterile

112
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:46,395
Then what did he need all that
money for?

113
00:26:48,668 --> 00:26:50,795
He put it in the bank

114
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,598
Of course, the money will all be returned
to you...

115
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:56,900
With no kid, what did he need all that
money for?

116
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,488
He... was going to buy a yacht

117
00:27:23,302 --> 00:27:28,467
The police have big sticks but they
don't know how to use them

118
00:27:28,608 --> 00:27:33,068
If we leave it to them, there'd be nothing
but never-ending trials...

119
00:27:33,312 --> 00:27:34,802
And all those bloody reporters...

120
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:38,075
How about we leave it to Geum-ja?

121
00:27:38,284 --> 00:27:41,617
It'd be easier since she's been to jail
and all

122
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:45,219
That's cowardly! They're our kids

123
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:50,157
Then, let each person choose if
they want to be in or not

124
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:51,990
I'm for individual choice

125
00:27:52,165 --> 00:27:54,861
Why don't you just let him choose
his own death or trial, then...

126
00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:56,192
Individually?

127
00:27:56,402 --> 00:27:58,802
Little while ago, you wanted to hand him
over to the police

128
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:00,768
Then you wanted to leave it up
to Geum-ja...

129
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:03,498
Now you want to be left out alone?
What the hell do you want?

130
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,401
Won-mo's family has to follow the
majority, too

131
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:31,029
You know that, right?

132
00:28:31,204 --> 00:28:33,263
She has a weak heart...

133
00:28:35,441 --> 00:28:38,001
Hey, mine's weak, too

134
00:28:38,444 --> 00:28:40,844
Then Won-mo's father can represent
the family

135
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,149
One person per family should
be enough

136
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:45,606
Alright?

137
00:28:45,752 --> 00:28:48,312
What if Won-mo's mom informs
on us later?

138
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:51,788
She couldn't. Her husband's in on it, too

139
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:53,992
They could always get divorced

140
00:28:54,627 --> 00:28:57,095
We can leave some evidence, then

141
00:28:57,296 --> 00:29:00,561
How about we all take a picture?
So that...

142
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:04,203
...even if we feel guilty later... - Guilty?

143
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,438
Guilt for killing that bastard?

144
00:29:06,706 --> 00:29:10,733
We'd feel guilty if we didn't kill him
when we had him. That's guilt!

145
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,271
Let me say a word

146
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:21,587
I killed when I was in prison...

147
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:26,614
I'm also the one who caught Baek after
13 years of planning...

148
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:32,823
If anyone here informs the police...

149
00:29:36,135 --> 00:29:38,660
I won't say any more

150
00:29:40,373 --> 00:29:44,503
Shall we go in one at a time?
Or all together at once?

151
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:47,807
One at a time for what?
Let's just go finish him off

152
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,416
There's no need to share such a
personal matter with other families

153
00:29:51,884 --> 00:29:53,442
Isn't that right, dad?

154
00:29:57,123 --> 00:30:01,389
Won't it be scary going in alone?
And it could be dangerous

155
00:30:01,594 --> 00:30:03,289
Just think of it as using the toilet

156
00:30:04,831 --> 00:30:07,026
In any case, it's a private affair

157
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,328
Each to his own. A la carte...

158
00:30:10,703 --> 00:30:14,571
We don't all have to get the same
set menu

159
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,605
Please, honey...

160
00:30:18,211 --> 00:30:22,272
We're divorced
This isn't a couples thing!

161
00:30:22,815 --> 00:30:25,215
We don't have to go in together

162
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:33,454
Excuse me, I think...

163
00:30:35,027 --> 00:30:37,894
- It'd be too easy if we did it all together
- Honey!

164
00:30:40,733 --> 00:30:44,760
I brought along a sedative

165
00:30:46,706 --> 00:30:53,168
You couldn't even touch that finger
remember?

166
00:31:00,253 --> 00:31:02,312
Alright, then...

167
00:31:06,492 --> 00:31:09,928
Won-mo's father is out, and his mother
will go in alone...

168
00:31:10,196 --> 00:31:12,994
...Jae-kyoung's and Dong-hwa's are
going in together...

169
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,600
- Is that right? - Yes!

170
00:31:17,203 --> 00:31:18,363
Let's do it then!

171
00:31:20,106 --> 00:31:22,768
Wait! Just a second!

172
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,616
Shouldn't we decide what order you
go in?

173
00:32:22,969 --> 00:32:25,529
Will that be enough for you?

174
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,274
I can lend you mine after

175
00:32:31,444 --> 00:32:32,706
Well...

176
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:38,812
I think I'll be okay

177
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:54,389
Honey...

178
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:07,971
Everyone pay attention

179
00:33:09,215 --> 00:33:14,084
If you grip it like this, the tip of the knife
will slip and not penetrate deeply

180
00:33:14,353 --> 00:33:16,753
You could also cut your hand

181
00:33:16,856 --> 00:33:23,159
So grip it like this at all times, please

182
00:33:23,362 --> 00:33:27,321
Or you could just...

183
00:33:27,566 --> 00:33:34,267
...stab him like this

184
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:03,561
Why did you do it?

185
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:10,575
You look like a normal person

186
00:34:10,776 --> 00:34:16,772
Why?

187
00:34:21,821 --> 00:34:27,657
Ma'am, there's no such thing as
a perfect person

188
00:35:22,948 --> 00:35:24,643
This...

189
00:35:28,687 --> 00:35:31,588
...isn't going to bring our son back
is it, honey?

190
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:34,520
Right?

191
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:57,878
You all look very well off
Take a look at that

192
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:03,147
She took her boots off, so's not to get
blood on the suede

193
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:05,446
Does that make any sense to you here?

194
00:36:08,661 --> 00:36:15,089
My mom had to scrub hotel floors to
send my brother to that school

195
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:20,600
We ran around like dogs to come up
with the ransom

196
00:36:20,873 --> 00:36:26,140
Now we've lost our house and our
relatives won't see us

197
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:31,347
My daughter-in-law killed herself and
my son left the country

198
00:36:32,017 --> 00:36:34,713
We all have our own stories to tell

199
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:48,999
Dad!

200
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:54,602
We're not the last, dad. Eun-joo's
grandma's still waiting her turn

201
00:36:59,211 --> 00:37:00,906
Dad...

202
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:15,650
Come on, give me a hand!

203
00:37:18,197 --> 00:37:19,892
Mister, get up

204
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:23,591
Please. Get a hold of yourself!

205
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:16,534
I'm sorry, but...

206
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,805
Could you step aside a moment?

207
00:40:56,682 --> 00:40:57,944
Thank you

208
00:42:29,808 --> 00:42:34,711
Happy birthday to you...

209
00:42:42,654 --> 00:42:48,615
Happy birthday to you...

210
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:58,399
Happy birthday dear...

211
00:43:05,577 --> 00:43:07,306
I'm sorry

212
00:43:08,947 --> 00:43:11,347
It felt like a birthday to me...

213
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:15,814
We can say it is, then

214
00:43:16,755 --> 00:43:17,653
Happy birthday...

215
00:43:17,856 --> 00:43:23,692
...to you!

216
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,505
Will you wire the money into
our accounts?

217
00:44:26,024 --> 00:44:28,219
My account number

218
00:44:38,403 --> 00:44:40,803
In France...

219
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,641
...when there's a break in the
conversation like this...

220
00:44:45,177 --> 00:44:48,806
...they say an angel is passing

221
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:15,192
It's snowing!

222
00:46:18,136 --> 00:46:20,195
It's snowing a lot

223
00:46:20,539 --> 00:46:23,167
- When did it all pile up so much?
- What time is it now?

224
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:25,106
The traffic...

225
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:26,937
The roads will freeze soon

226
00:47:43,088 --> 00:47:44,419
Won-mo

227
00:47:49,928 --> 00:47:51,418
I have...

228
00:48:57,796 --> 00:49:00,060
Along the path on green grass...

229
00:49:00,332 --> 00:49:04,234
A lady in red heels goes...

230
00:49:04,703 --> 00:49:11,609
Click, click, click with her heels
Where might she be going?

231
00:49:13,011 --> 00:49:17,414
Won't she look back...

232
00:49:17,482 --> 00:49:19,245
Are you really going to send Jenny back?

233
00:49:19,517 --> 00:49:22,714
...back my way for a glance?

234
00:49:23,154 --> 00:49:24,246
Are you?

235
00:49:24,889 --> 00:49:29,155
One step, two...

236
00:49:29,561 --> 00:49:41,132
The lady in red heels takes another
step away, alone...

237
00:49:50,582 --> 00:49:57,078
Lee Geum-ja made a great mistake
in her youth...

238
00:49:57,389 --> 00:50:00,517
And used other people to achieve
her own goals...

239
00:50:00,725 --> 00:50:07,221
But she still couldn't find the redemption
she so desired

240
00:50:23,448 --> 00:50:25,382
In spite of this...

241
00:50:25,617 --> 00:50:27,414
Actually, because of this...

242
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:33,120
I liked Geum-ja

243
00:53:46,751 --> 00:53:48,275
Farewell...

244
00:53:48,753 --> 00:53:50,311
...Geum-ja
