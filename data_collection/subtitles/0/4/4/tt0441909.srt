1
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,958
Put some stones in the vase
or it'll fall over.

2
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,325
This bloody wind!

3
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,471
Polish the letters well.

4
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,571
There are so many widows!

5
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,573
The women here
live longer than the men.

6
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,676
- Except poor Mom.
- Mom was lucky.

7
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,439
Raimunda, don't say that!

8
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,741
She died in dad's arms,
and she loved him more than anyone.

9
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,180
Burned to death!

10
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,647
That's the worst way to die.

11
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,189
They were asleep.

12
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,716
They didn't even realize.

13
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,761
Even so, how can you say
something like that!

14
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,970
Hello.

15
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,207
- Is that everything, Mom?
- I'll get the rest.

16
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:24,835
This is wonderful!

17
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,136
Good Lord!

18
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,906
- Is this Paula?
- Of course.

19
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,241
She's all grown up!

20
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,542
Give her a kiss.

21
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,346
She's got your father's eyes.

22
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,014
- How are you?
- Not good.

23
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,316
Don't say that.

24
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,055
I want to give my grave the once- over.

25
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,591
With this wind, you can't keep it clean.

26
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:48,597
- It looks lovely.
- Cleaning it relaxes me.

27
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,994
I often come and sit here on my own,
and time goes by.

28
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,134
We're going now,
we have to see Aunt Paula.

29
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,200
- Come and see me afterwards.
- Sure.

30
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,641
How's Paco?

31
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,547
He's fine, he stayed
in Madrid, working.

32
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,117
Mom,

33
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,155
does Agustina really come
and clean her own grave?

34
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,948
Yes, it's the custom here.

35
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,826
They buy a plot
and look after it all their lives,

36
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,086
like a second home.

37
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,157
- That freaks me out!
- It's tradition here.

38
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,800
- Shall I drive?
- Yes.

39
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,388
Aunt Paula!

40
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,392
Who is it?

41
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,529
Raimunda!

42
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,291
- Don't take all day.
- Don't rush me.

43
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,058
I don't like going back
in the dark.

44
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,632
Be nice to Auntie, don't laugh at her.

45
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,272
- All right.
- This house still smells of Mom.

46
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,173
How are you, Aunt?

47
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,880
You're very thin!
Have you had the baby?

48
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,175
- Fourteen years ago.
- Doesn't time fly!

49
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,282
And who are these?

50
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,045
Who do you think?
Sole and my Paula!

51
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,380
The same name as me!

52
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,818
And Sole.

53
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,720
Shall we go into the dining room?

54
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,195
That Sole looks like a right sourpuss.

55
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,699
For Heaven's sake!

56
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:37,198
...the wind carried
the cinders to the bushes.

57
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,706
The result is the most tragic fire
in the last 13 years.

58
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,943
- Mind if I turn it off?
- No, I can't see it anyway.

59
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,177
Fires are dreadful.

60
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,316
That's how your grandparents died.

61
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,387
- Why did I come in here?
- I don't know.

62
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,251
To talk?

63
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,660
- To get some food?
- Yes!

64
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,395
Look in the sideboard.

65
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,133
I'm very shaky on my pins.

66
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,704
Look, wafers!

67
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,903
Just like mom's.
Eat up.

68
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,737
How was the cemetery?

69
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,276
Your mother is delighted.

70
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,043
Did you scrub the headstone properly?

71
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,445
Of course.

72
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,681
She likes it to be clean.

73
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,118
If she could, she'd clean it herself.

74
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,882
But, of course, she can't.

75
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,518
Of course, she can't.

76
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,724
Don't you feel lonely
in this big house?

77
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,895
You'd be better off in a home,
where you'd be looked after.

78
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,032
I'm fine as I am.

79
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,874
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Well, go!

80
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,508
You can't live on your own.
I'm worried about you.

81
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,543
How do you manage your meals?

82
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:51,442
Very well.

83
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,916
Agustina brings me bread,
your mother does the cooking

84
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:58,487
and if I need anything
I call the store and they bring it...

85
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,825
I'm fine.

86
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,430
What a lovely touch!

87
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,039
Look!

88
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,175
It's got your name on it.

89
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:56,872
Shall we go?

90
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:58,915
Yes.

91
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,612
We're leaving now.

92
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,755
I'm so shaky on my pins.

93
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,188
- Don't get up.
- How could I not get up?

94
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,997
Next time I come back,
I'm taking you home with me.

95
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,960
Yes, next time.

96
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,529
What matters is that you come back.

97
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,864
You've gotten very wobbly.

98
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,593
- Take care of yourself.
- I will.

99
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,765
Mind how you go!

100
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,403
We'll do that. I love you lots!

101
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,938
- Shall we go to Agustina's?
- Yes.

102
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,049
Come in!

103
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,850
Well?

104
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,585
- How did you find your aunt?
- Bad.

105
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:15,725
Terrible.

106
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,226
She's gotten very shaky.
I don't know how she copes.

107
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,592
he does very well
without going outside.

108
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,858
She eats a stick of bread every day.
She leaves the money for me.

109
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,796
Let's go onto the patio.

110
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,365
She's in an awful state, love.

111
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,597
She doesn't know what year it is.

112
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:33,642
She talks about mom
as if she were still alive.

113
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,908
For her, she isn't dead.

114
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,945
She can't accept it.

115
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,983
Sit down for a while.

116
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,887
I'd like to pay you something
to look in on her every day.

117
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,217
I won't accept anything!
I'm very happy to do it.

118
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,121
I'd take her home,

119
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,456
but I'd have to throw
my husband out to make room.

120
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,029
But we have to do something.

121
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,100
Every morning, before I go shopping,
I tap on her window

122
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,931
and I don't move until she answers me.

123
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,400
I keep an eye on her.

124
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,906
I really appreciate that.

125
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,276
I like to think...

126
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,807
someone's doing that for my mother,

127
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,711
wherever she is.

128
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,953
Look! Wasn't she cutting edge then?

129
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,122
The only hippie in the village.

130
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,495
Look at her plastic jewelry.

131
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,900
- They're awesome!
- First- rate plastic.

132
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,039
Every time I smoke a joint
I think of her.

133
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,307
That's a fine example
you're setting for Paula!

134
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,878
- There's still no news?
- Nothing.

135
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,284
It's like the earth swallowed her up.

136
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,053
- And your sister Brigida?
- Her?

137
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,726
She's in Madrid,
she's a big hit on trash TV.

138
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,927
Mom, I'm out of credit!

139
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,901
Good, we'll get a break
from the telephone.

140
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,536
- You can use mine.
- She'll bankrupt you.

141
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,865
In that case, no.

142
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,598
As I was saying,
Brigida is on so many shows

143
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,506
she can put a deposit
on an apartment in Madrid.

144
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,112
And she's going to make a record.

145
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,545
- She always liked singing.
- So did this one.

146
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,785
Remember when you and she,

147
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,849
you must've been thirteen,

148
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,920
went to an audition for child singers?

149
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,183
Hey, you never told me that!

150
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,796
It was your granny's idea.
She was up for anything.

151
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,322
Talking of mothers,
maybe yours hasn't shown up

152
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,023
so as not to ruin
your sister's career.

153
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,529
Mom would love to be on television.

154
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,269
She'd go crazy.

155
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,636
Want some?

156
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,139
I grow it myself. Look at the plants.

157
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,149
We have to leave.

158
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:57,087
Did you report her disappearance
to the police?

159
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,620
Brigida thinks it isn't necessary.

160
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,554
She's said it so often on TV.

161
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,892
Yes, but you have to report it
to the police, not say it on TV.

162
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:07,926
I don't know.

163
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,967
In any case, it's not
the first time she's left home.

164
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,299
But never for so long.

165
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,366
It's been over three years.

166
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,276
Don't give up hope.

167
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,910
And take care of yourself,
you don't look well.

168
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,610
Your oleander looks wonderful.

169
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:28,082
Yes, it didn't get aphids this year.
But I've really lost my appetite.

170
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:29,752
Maybe it's the joints.

171
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:33,254
No, if it weren't for them,
I wouldn't eat at all.

172
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,061
Your father's eyes.

173
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:45,159
A joint makes me feel a bit hungry
and it relaxes me.

174
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,103
Safe journey!

175
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,891
Guess what I saw upstairs
beside the bathroom!

176
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:09,658
What?

177
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,963
- An exercise bike.
- That freaks me out!

178
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,135
Why would auntie want a bike
if she can't walk?

179
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,764
Exactly, she's lost her mind.

180
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,304
Don't talk like that about her.

181
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,938
She didn't even recognize us.

182
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:27,772
It's the wind.

183
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,013
That goddamn East wind here
drives people crazy!

184
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,277
The wafers are delicious.

185
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,847
How can she bake those
when she's as blind as a bat?

186
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,708
Hello, Regina.

187
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,584
- Going to work?
- Got no choice, love.

188
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,786
- Why not give her a lift?
- Where are you going?

189
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,185
To the club. If you drop me
in the center that'd be great.

190
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:16,951
- All right.
- Thanks.

191
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,387
See you later.

192
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,412
- Hi, dad.
- Hi.

193
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,638
Hello.

194
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,355
Well?

195
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,651
Did you have fun?

196
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,889
In the cemetery?
You kidding me?

197
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:59,161
- Were you having a party?
- Me? What do you mean?

198
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,100
Paula, sit properly. Close your legs!

199
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:06,838
Will you bring me another beer?

200
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,071
Are you kidding?

201
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,741
Go on, please.

202
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,254
Haven't you had enough?
You have to work tomorrow.

203
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,520
I'm free tomorrow, and the day after too.

204
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:23,695
How come?

205
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,724
I was fired.

206
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,391
Hang on.

207
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,133
Christ Almighty!

208
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,432
I'll get a job on Sundays,
it's my only free day.

209
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,673
I'll get a job, but let me
watch the game in peace.

210
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:46,117
You can forget about soccer.
There'll be no more cable.

211
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,181
We're a poor family
and we'll live like one.

212
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,489
Paula, put that phone down!

213
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,252
Your supper's here if you want it.

214
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,418
Are you angry?

215
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,523
I'm worried about my aunt.

216
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,866
She's worse than ever.

217
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,067
She didn't even recognize
Paula and Sole.

218
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,709
- I don't know how she manages.
- But she does.

219
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:48,943
Leave me be.

220
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,308
What's wrong?

221
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,849
I'm worn out and I have to get up early.

222
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,920
I'll do the work.

223
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,417
Don't be a pest!

224
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,761
Don't call me a pest.

225
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,732
Sorry.

226
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,017
What are you doing here?

227
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,990
- Waiting for you.
- What for?

228
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,635
I called to tell you to buy bread.
you loads of times

229
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,268
I don't suppose you
thought to buy any.

230
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,265
You're soaked.
How long have you been here?

231
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,910
A while.

232
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,316
Where were you? With your pals?

233
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,713
I wasn't anywhere.

234
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,184
Why didn't you answer the phone?

235
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:16,818
What's wrong?

236
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,694
Is something wrong?

237
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,335
Tell me, what's happened?

238
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,710
Where's your father?

239
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:40,648
He's...

240
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,747
Where?

241
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,020
In the kitchen.

242
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,333
What happened?

243
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,274
I was in the kitchen,
with my back to him

244
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,374
and suddenly dad jumped on me.

245
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,971
He was drunk.

246
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:14,243
I asked him what he was doing
and he said he wasn't my father.

247
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,885
I pushed him away.

248
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,484
But he got up
and put his arms around me.

249
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,258
I pushed him again.

250
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,701
He unzipped his pants.

251
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,966
He kept saying that it wasn't wrong

252
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,605
and that he wasn't my father!

253
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,785
I took a knife from the drawer

254
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,613
and I threatened him

255
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,252
but it was only to scare him.

256
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,226
He didn't believe me.

257
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,261
He said I wouldn't dare

258
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,326
and he jumped on me.

259
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,943
What are you going to do?

260
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,711
I don't know.

261
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,322
Go and change, or you'll get pneumonia.

262
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,159
Remember, I killed him

263
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:38,302
and you saw nothing, you weren't here.

264
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,365
It's very important you remember that.

265
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,214
Don't open!

266
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,641
Who can it be?

267
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:32,984
I don't know.

268
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:34,519
Go to your room.

269
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,612
Raimunda, it's me, Emilio.

270
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:42,586
Coming!

271
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:51,359
Hi there.

272
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,696
I'm sorry, I know it's late,
but I'm going to Barcelona tomorrow.

273
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:58,535
I want to give you the restaurant keys
in case anyone comes to see it.

274
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,706
I don't mind, It's just I'm never at home.

275
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,075
What about Paco? He's always here.

276
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,676
Paco...

277
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:11,417
He finally got a job.
He's starting tomorrow.

278
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,182
Are you hurt?

279
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,792
Women's troubles.

280
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,629
But now that I think about it,

281
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,763
with Paco working
I'll have more free time.

282
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,962
- Give me the keys, I'll sort it out.
- Here.

283
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,002
This is my brother's home number.

284
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,764
The other is my cellphone.

285
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,944
- You're leaving tomorrow?
- In the morning.

286
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:39,844
Tell me, how much are you asking?
I always liked your restaurant.

287
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,280
It's a pity you didn't like
the owner too.

288
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,083
Emilio, please...

289
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,315
For the lease, five million,
but it's negotiable.

290
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,590
We'll miss you.

291
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,321
And I'll miss you girls.

292
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,960
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

293
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,165
- Is Emilio leaving?
- Yes.

294
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:10,003
- Go back to your room.
- I want to be with you.

295
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,354
You'll have to help me later.

296
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,419
Don't answer!

297
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,888
It'll be one of your pals.

298
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,060
Answer it, tell them you can't talk.

299
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,837
This is no time to be calling.

300
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,669
I can't talk...

301
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,346
What do you mean? It's your Aunt Sole.

302
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,274
Put your mother on.

303
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,743
It's Aunt Sole.

304
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,546
Tell her I'm busy.

305
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,611
She's busy now.

306
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,653
Put her on, it's important.

307
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,982
Take the phone, Mom.

308
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,591
Sole, I've got a pile of ironing

309
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,631
and I was out working all afternoon.

310
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,063
Agustina rang.

311
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,161
Aunt Paula is dead.

312
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,003
- When?
- A little while ago.

313
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,743
Aunt Paula is dead.

314
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,284
Just a minute ago I was thinking
of bringing her here.

315
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,152
She died all alone!

316
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,724
Don't cry, pet.

317
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,721
Listen, Agustina said
we're not to worry.

318
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:35,695
She and Squinty will lay her out
before we get there.

319
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,165
Auntie had everything organized.

320
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,339
She even chose her coffin
and paid for everything.

321
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:45,568
It's incredible that
she was so lucid at the end.

322
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,976
I can't go to the funeral.

323
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,742
I'm truly sorry,

324
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:51,981
but I'm very busy.

325
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,811
How can you not go!
What will people say!

326
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,011
I can't go, not remotely.

327
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:00,651
You have to go on your own.

328
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:01,951
On my own?

329
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:06,288
No way. You know
I'm terrified of the dead.

330
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:08,394
But you needn't see Auntie.

331
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,691
I'll tell Agustina to make sure of that.

332
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,199
And if they ask for you?

333
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,869
Say I've had a gallbladder
operation... anything.

334
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,608
I'll go later, but today
it's not remotely possible.

335
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:23,414
I don't understand you.
Auntie loved you so much.

336
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,041
And I loved her.

337
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:30,385
I'll explain it to you some day,
and that day, you'll flip.

338
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,954
I'm flipping now.

339
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,283
Take a tranquilizer,
I'm going to take one too.

340
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,586
And you go tomorrow morning.

341
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,026
All right?

342
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,357
I guess...

343
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:02,885
The door!

344
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:25,238
Wait!

345
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,039
You stay here.
Stay here and keep watch.

346
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,610
I hope it hasn't changed
since I worked here.

347
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,548
DEEP FREEZE

348
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,924
Stay where you are!

349
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:29,819
Sorry.

350
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:32,563
What do you want?

351
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,663
Is the restaurant open?

352
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,193
Why?

353
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,265
Give me a hand.

354
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,199
We're shooting a film in the area

355
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,706
and I'm looking for somewhere
we can all eat.

356
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,511
Do you know
any restaurants around here?

357
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,150
How many are you?

358
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,618
25 and 5... 30.

359
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,583
Come on, help me.

360
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:08,499
I can do it for you, if you want.
We were going to close today.

361
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,591
So, lunch for thirty.

362
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:13,996
At what time?

363
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,699
We stop at 3:30, and we're very close.

364
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,309
- Around 4:00?
- Yeah.

365
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,144
And, tell me, how much...?

366
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,810
Ten euros a head.

367
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,875
That's fine.

368
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:35,153
I'm sorry I shouted at you,
but you scared me.

369
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,863
- Well, I'll see you at 4:00.
- Sure.

370
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,463
Thanks a lot.

371
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:44,996
It's 10:00!

372
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,839
- Two kilos.
- Give me another two kilos.

373
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,803
How much are the potatoes?

374
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,176
1.60 for four kilos.

375
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,148
- Give me eight kilos.
- Sure.

376
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,447
Hello, Regina.

377
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,092
Hello, you're carting quite a load!

378
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,126
I have to make lunch for 30.

379
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:16,762
- Could you lend me 100 euros?
- I'm broke, love.

380
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,833
I've just bought
a chunk of pork this big.

381
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,471
I could use that. I'll buy it from you.

382
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,667
It cost me 10.80, It's all I have!

383
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,036
I'll pay you tomorrow. Come on!

384
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,101
I'll bring it over to you now.

385
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,213
- Thanks, love.
- I'll have to diet today.

386
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:31,814
It'll do you good.

387
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,313
Hey, Ines! Back from the village?

388
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,352
I got here yesterday. How are you?

389
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,494
Did you happen to bring
any sausages or chorizo?

390
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,157
I certainly did! The sausages are great.

391
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,357
My mother-in-law orders them
specially for me.

392
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,900
- I need a kilo or so.
- Why's that?

393
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,698
- I have to cook for 30.
- Who's coming?

394
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,534
I'll tell you later.

395
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,967
Can I buy them? I'll pay you tomorrow.

396
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,872
- Sure, it's no problem.
- Thanks.

397
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,345
Did you bring anything sweet?

398
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,645
I brought some cookies
that melt in your mouth.

399
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,481
With the way your glucose
and cholesterol are,

400
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,486
I can't believe you brought cookies.

401
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,717
It's my only vice. Three boxes.

402
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,223
You shouldn't eat them.

403
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,489
- What do I do, give them away?
- Sell them to me.

404
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,633
At least let me taste them.

405
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,396
You can eat three or four
but don't stuff yourself.

406
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,470
- Bring them round to me, love.
- I'll do that.

407
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,164
Thanks.

408
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,843
Bye, pet.

409
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:49,458
Who'd like some pork? It's delicious.

410
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,288
You too?

411
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,536
Some pork? It's delicious.

412
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,575
Agustina?

413
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,087
Is that you?

414
00:34:58,629 --> 00:34:59,891
Soledad,

415
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,592
daughter.

416
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,591
Sole,

417
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,998
I have to talk to you.

418
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,453
Sole!

419
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,835
There, there.

420
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,331
Take it easy.

421
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:45,803
Where is she?

422
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,412
Upstairs, in my mother's room,

423
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,375
the best room in the house.

424
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:53,943
I brought her here
to give her a better wake.

425
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,019
Thank you so much.

426
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,124
Come on, we're the principal mourners.

427
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,523
Good afternoon.

428
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,834
I spoke to your sister.
She's just had an operation.

429
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,667
Yes, what timing.

430
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,132
She said you're not to see the body.

431
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,140
Don't worry, you won't have to.

432
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,792
Say hello to Vicenta's daughter.

433
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:49,263
We'll let her rest a while,
she's very tired.

434
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:51,436
Come on.

435
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,937
Over here.

436
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,315
It was late at night.

437
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,047
I'd had supper and I was
watching the television.

438
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,792
I heard someone knocking at my door.

439
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:14,657
I wasn't sure, but just then

440
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,230
I heard the same noise,

441
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,134
and I asked, "Who is it?"

442
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,199
And a voice answered,

443
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,807
"Agustina".

444
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:29,143
I wasn't afraid.

445
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,745
I went outside but I saw no one.

446
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,576
I looked over at your aunt's house

447
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,754
and the door seemed to be open.

448
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,090
I thought it was odd,

449
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,490
so I went in.

450
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,058
I called your aunt

451
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,553
but she didn't answer me.

452
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,557
How could she answer me, poor thing?

453
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,035
I went into her room

454
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,798
and I found her there, in bed,

455
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,105
as still as a little bird!

456
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,177
It was her spirit that warned you.

457
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,175
But was it Paula's spirit
or the other one's?

458
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,747
One of the two.

459
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,282
I can't say who it was, I didn't see.

460
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,654
But just as I'm listening to you now,

461
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:18,027
someone or something
warned me that Paula had died,

462
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,126
and opened the door so I could go in.

463
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:24,129
Come into the kitchen.

464
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,773
I bet you haven't eaten yet.

465
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,068
No.

466
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,811
Not since last night, but I'm all right.

467
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,310
I thought as much.

468
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,351
This'll do you good.

469
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:47,388
Don't give me any more! That's enough.

470
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,792
What did the women mean?

471
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,169
It was just talk.

472
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,062
You know what villages are like.

473
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,301
They were talking about my mother.

474
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,442
Some people say they've seen her.

475
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,810
They say she came back
to look after your Aunt Paula.

476
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,847
Has she not appeared to you?

477
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,178
No. What about you?

478
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,947
No, but those things happen.

479
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,352
I know.

480
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,323
My grandfather, God rest him,
appeared to my grandmother.

481
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,026
At first she was frightened.

482
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:30,958
Eat up!

483
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,700
Then she asked him what he wanted

484
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,562
and his spirit told her

485
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,536
there was a promise
he hadn't fulfilled.

486
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,968
She carried it out

487
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,974
and the whole village
went with her to the cemetery

488
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:47,343
where they left my grandfather
so he'd rest in peace.

489
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,246
And he never appeared again.

490
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,950
That isn't just a story I heard.

491
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:58,888
I lived it.

492
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,326
Do you want to go
into your aunt's house

493
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,928
in case you want to take anything?

494
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,128
No, Raimunda will come later.

495
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:42,863
Tell her it went very well
and the whole village came.

496
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,264
I'll do that.

497
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,605
I'm going to miss her so much!

498
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:54,807
Go on.

499
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,116
Let me out, Sole!

500
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,821
Let me out! I'm your mother.

501
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,456
I won't do anything to you.

502
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,296
My mother is dead.

503
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:25,434
If you're anything,
you're her ghost or her spirit.

504
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,611
Whatever you say,
but get me out of here.

505
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,841
I'm in the trunk of your car.

506
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:34,841
Really, mom, the things you do!

507
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,221
Soledad,

508
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,157
daughter,

509
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,623
don't be afraid of me.

510
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,033
I'm your mother.

511
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:56,697
Aren't you going to give me a hug?

512
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,984
Now, give me a hand.

513
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:12,719
Take this.

514
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,859
- Auntie's suitcase!
- Yes.

515
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,058
What is all this?

516
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,965
Clothes, and some valuables Auntie had.

517
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,638
A good thing I hid them
before the neighbors arrived.

518
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,967
Except for Agustina,
they all went through everything,

519
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,668
but I'd got there first.

520
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,075
You'll have to give Agustina a gift,
she's been so good.

521
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,914
Better than your sister.

522
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,779
There was such a fuss
when she didn't turn up.

523
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,619
If you'd heard
what Squinty said about her!

524
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,190
Thank heavens you came.

525
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:52,786
I'm wrecked after the trip.

526
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,136
- Are you sleeping here?
- Yes, where do you want me to go?

527
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:04,262
What a sight!
I'm not surprised I scared you.

528
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,107
Do you still have the illegal hair salon?

529
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:08,709
That's how I make my living.

530
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,611
- Is that the guest room?
- Yes, that's it.

531
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,514
Tomorrow, you can give me
a color and a trim.

532
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,247
And I need dark glasses too.

533
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:20,680
I don't want to be
stuck in the house all day.

534
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,456
I have to go out.

535
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:24,660
Nobody knows me here.

536
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:27,893
In the village, I couldn't
even go to the front door.

537
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:29,930
I need a bit of air.

538
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,197
Are you staying for long?

539
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:39,809
- You want to throw me out already?
- No, I'm just asking.

540
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:44,447
I'll stay for as long as God wills,
if you don't mind.

541
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,614
When you tire of me,
you just have to say so.

542
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:50,818
But for a separated woman,

543
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,113
who's better company than her mother?

544
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:57,560
Unless you've got yourself a sweety-pie.

545
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,321
No, mom.

546
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,457
I'm alone, like always.

547
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,892
Not anymore.

548
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:07,529
Answer the phone.

549
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,466
- Are you back?
- Yes.

550
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,871
You were out of range so I rang Agustina.

551
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:16,635
She said it all went very well.

552
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,476
The whole village came.

553
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:23,080
I've been thinking about you all day.
I really wanted to be there.

554
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,451
Hang on, Sole.

555
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,249
What do I owe for the drinks?

556
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,060
They're on the house.

557
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:35,322
- Well, tomorrow, same time.
- Sure.

558
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,557
- The crew were very happy.
- I'm glad.

559
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:40,359
If you don't mind,
and even if you charge more,

560
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,903
could the helpings be more generous?

561
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:46,399
Tomorrow, you'll have food
coming out your eyes.

562
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,905
- Great, see you then.
- So long.

563
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,043
Sorry, Sole.

564
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,616
Have you got a job in a restaurant too?

565
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,219
Yes, I've taken over Emilio's place.

566
00:45:58,455 --> 00:45:59,513
Good Lord!

567
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,317
He was sick of it,
but that's not the only news.

568
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:04,922
Paco has left us.

569
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,192
That's why I couldn't go to the funeral.

570
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,126
We were having a row when you rang.

571
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,766
I knew something was wrong.

572
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,333
Did he hit you?

573
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:15,735
Paco wasn't violent.

574
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:17,804
He's just gone,

575
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,703
forever.

576
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,068
He'll come back, you'll see.

577
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,906
I doubt it.

578
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,274
Why are you so sure?

579
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,074
You can tell these things.

580
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:30,817
Well, so long.

581
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:32,953
So long.

582
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,321
'Bye.

583
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,720
None of the three of us
had any luck with men.

584
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:42,056
Raimunda and I didn't, but you...

585
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:43,757
Me, what?

586
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:45,432
Dad adored you.

587
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,831
Raimunda says that you were lucky,

588
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,666
you died in the arms
of the person you loved most.

589
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,434
Your sister isn't a bad person
but she's got a nasty streak.

590
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,470
I was blind about him

591
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:00,673
and he cheated on me
until the day he died!

592
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,980
- What do you mean?
- It's true.

593
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:07,289
I kept that quiet all my life.
I never wanted you two to know.

594
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:11,052
But let's drop it. I don't want
to talk ill of the dead.

595
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,824
- Is he going to appear?
- I hope not.

596
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,126
And your husband?

597
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,195
What about him?

598
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,433
Might he turn up some day?

599
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,897
I doubt it.

600
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,204
I haven't heard from him in two years.

601
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:29,037
All the better. It'll just be
the two of us together.

602
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,793
- The pork cost you... 10?
- 10.80.

603
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:28,261
- I'll give you an extra 3 euros.
- Thanks, love.

604
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:31,839
And I'll pay you for four boxes
of cookies, not three.

605
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,209
Thanks.

606
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,934
I don't want you to think I'd cheat you.

607
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:40,814
Could you help me with this?
I can't move it on my own.

608
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,344
- Where are you taking it?
- To the restaurant.

609
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,746
You're the expert in removals.
Where do we...?

610
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:49,983
Get a hold of it,
tip it over, but not all the way.

611
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,991
- Otherwise we won't get it through.
- Is this all right?

612
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,563
Now, straighten up, to the right,
more to the right...

613
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,702
- We can't see anything.
- I'll guide you.

614
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:02,395
Careful, it'll come this way.

615
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:05,197
All the way...

616
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:06,398
Don't rush it.

617
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:09,569
Are we at the door?

618
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,846
The elevator is here.

619
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:16,786
Wait, wait. This has to go in straight.

620
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:18,579
I'll take this end.

621
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:20,547
You take it.

622
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:21,849
You're doing fine.

623
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,250
Good Lord! This is tough.

624
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,586
Careful!

625
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:30,525
Call it from downstairs.

626
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,470
I want them to see
we don't use frozen food.

627
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:39,866
It's all natural, fresh every day.

628
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:41,668
Over to the corner.

629
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,376
- And the other freezer?
- It's broken.

630
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,305
So you're taking over the restaurant?

631
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:50,183
Yes, at least until the crew
finishes the film.

632
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:51,946
Then I'll see.

633
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:55,417
You can count on me.
I make great desserts.

634
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,887
And I can serve drinks at night.

635
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:01,860
I don't know if we'll work nights,
but I'm counting on you.

636
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,657
- Sure.
- And thanks.

637
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,638
Mom...

638
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:15,274
Is there anything you want me to do?

639
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:16,840
Cut my hair.

640
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:19,744
I mean,

641
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:22,245
is there anything

642
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,448
you left undone in life

643
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,789
that won't let you rest in peace?

644
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,417
People always leave things undone,

645
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:32,926
or done badly,

646
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,726
and I'm no exception.

647
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,965
But I don't know if they can be fixed.

648
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,133
And if they can,

649
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,470
it's up to me to fix them.

650
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:49,340
My clients will be arriving soon.
What'll we do?

651
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,413
Look after them. I'll help you.

652
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:56,181
But I can't say you're my mother.
They know I'm an orphan.

653
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,955
- I'll say I'm a foreigner.
- A foreigner?

654
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,683
From where?

655
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:03,459
Dominican Republic?

656
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,653
No, there are lots around here,
they'd notice your accent.

657
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:10,657
Chinese?

658
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:14,767
- Madrid's full of Chinese.
- Who'd believe you're Chinese!

659
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,830
Something we don't have around here.

660
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,236
Russian!

661
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,941
Do I really look more
Russian than Chinese?

662
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,709
Yes, the Russians are like us.

663
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:33,086
Look, whatever you hear,
keep your mouth shut.

664
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,987
And don't let them see
that you understand us.

665
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,824
I'll show you how everything works.

666
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:41,027
In the bedroom, I cut, dry and color,

667
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,755
and here I wash their hair.

668
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:48,735
If the client is tall, lift this up.
If she's small, put it down.

669
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:51,932
This towel is to keep you from slipping.

670
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,036
And I keep this here

671
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,469
because up above it's very uncomfortable

672
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:57,905
and if it's down there

673
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,117
I have to bend down so often
I wreck my back.

674
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:03,150
I get a lot of backaches too.

675
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,614
And the shampoo is measured out.

676
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,013
Sit down.

677
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:14,059
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

678
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:17,198
Just one towel
or the client will feel suffocated.

679
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,492
I'm the same.

680
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,669
And then, with that same towel,

681
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,839
you dry her hair a bit
so it doesn't drip down her back.

682
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:28,243
It's all so well organized.
You're very smart, love.

683
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,945
Hello.

684
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:43,522
She doesn't speak Spanish, she's Russian.

685
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,251
They're in a terrible state.

686
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:46,724
I took her in out of charity.

687
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,292
When I saw her begging in the street,

688
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:50,591
she reminded me of my mother.

689
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,597
Don't trust all the old women you see,

690
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:54,292
especially Russians.
There are lots of mafias.

691
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,529
People take advantage of you.

692
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:58,968
Are you getting streaks?
Sit down here.

693
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,974
Wash hair, yes.

694
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,808
- She was a hairdresser in Russia.
- How do you communicate?

695
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,877
With signs. She understands
everything. She's sharp.

696
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:10,846
She'll speak Spanish in no time.

697
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:14,285
Yes, look at all the top models
who are Russian.

698
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:15,617
Heavens!

699
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:22,822
- So, Russian?
- Russia.

700
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,467
The water,

701
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,067
not hot,

702
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:33,765
not cold.

703
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:36,577
Very good.

704
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:54,161
Hello.

705
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:56,063
Hey, there.

706
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,260
We have a day off tomorrow.

707
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,163
Then we'll have one too.
We need a break.

708
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:05,099
And we finish up next week.

709
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,569
We wanted to have the wrap party here.

710
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:08,935
Great.

711
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:12,073
Do you want a sit-down meal
or a buffet?

712
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,616
A buffet would be great.

713
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:18,147
And we'd like to have
the terrace just for us.

714
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:20,883
That's no problem.

715
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,452
Don't look at me like that,
you make me nervous.

716
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,655
Same here.

717
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,864
Go and have a drink, I'm working.

718
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:33,299
All right.

719
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,365
She's been strange
since she came back from the village.

720
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:41,068
If she asks you about Paco,
you know nothing.

721
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:42,705
And it's true.

722
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,805
The less you know the better.

723
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:47,209
And above all
don't keep thinking about it.

724
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:03,093
Hello.

725
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:06,232
- Are you with someone?
- No.

726
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,471
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- What for?

727
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:11,233
I'm dying to piss.

728
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,633
It's broken.
I'm waiting for the plumber.

729
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:17,813
I'll throw some water down,
for Christ's sake! I have to piss.

730
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:21,909
Hello!

731
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:25,685
What's wrong with you?

732
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:29,117
- I'm at a difficult age.
- You're not the only one.

733
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,261
- I'm going to trim your hair.
- No, I know you.

734
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:35,055
- Just the ends.
- Less than a centimeter.

735
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:43,337
Tell me,

736
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:45,936
has your dad not come back?

737
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:49,509
No. He said goodbye for good.

738
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,983
That's incredible.
I just don't understand.

739
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:58,777
It smells of farts!

740
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:06,289
What's your mother up to?

741
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:07,759
What?

742
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:10,728
She's such a pain!
Ever since she was a child.

743
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:14,328
And in those days
we didn't have a bathroom.

744
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,772
We did it in the yard.

745
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:18,803
We'd be waiting for her all day.

746
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,872
All day long she'd be in the yard,
with the hens.

747
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,474
This dressing gown...

748
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:03,483
It's Mom's.

749
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,147
I know that.

750
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,519
And the smell?

751
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,519
What smell?

752
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:13,318
In the bathroom and here.

753
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:17,232
It's as if Mom had just been here,
farting her ass off!

754
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,662
Don't you smell it?

755
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,802
The way she used to fart!

756
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:31,144
And she could never hide it
because she was the first to laugh!

757
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:37,145
It's as if I can hear her now.

758
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:41,223
Don't be silly!

759
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:50,863
Why did you bring these clothes?

760
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,996
No wonder you have nightmares.

761
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,770
You give away dead people's clothes.

762
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,168
Aunt Paula's suitcase!

763
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:20,762
The antique dolls!

764
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,771
Her jewel case!

765
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,739
What were you going to do with this?

766
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:39,448
Nothing.

767
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:41,514
You were going to keep it.

768
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:42,944
Really, Sole.

769
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:44,676
Don't get the wrong idea.

770
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:47,055
I didn't bring the case.
