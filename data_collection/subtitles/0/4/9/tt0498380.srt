1
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,930
How did those soldiers ever manage
to dig out these tunnels?

2
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,200
Let's get a rotation in here.

3
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,270
Hey, I found something!

4
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,380
<i>Hanako...</i>

5
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,290
<i>We soldiers dig.</i>

6
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,460
<i>We dig all day.</i>

7
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,530
<i>This is the hole that we will fight...</i>

8
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,070
<i>and die in.</i>

9
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,870
<i>Hanako...</i>

10
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,670
<i>am I digging my own grave?</i>

11
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,000
<i>Today, I head for
the post where my men await.</i>

12
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,110
<i>I am determined to serve
and give my life for my country.</i>

13
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,770
<i>I believe I have organized
everything at home...</i>

14
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,580
<i>but I am sorry I wasn't able to attend
to the kitchen floor before I left.</i>

15
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,020
<i>I had all the intention...</i>

16
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,520
<i>but had to leave
without having the time...</i>

17
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,020
<i>and I am still worried about it.</i>

18
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,420
<i>So make sure to have
Taro take care of it promptly.</i>

19
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,460
Damn this island!
The Americans can have it.

20
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,280
Nothing grows here.

21
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:16,280
It smells. It's hot. There are too many
damn bugs, and there's no water.

22
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,360
This island is part
of Japan's sacred homeland.

23
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,720
There's nothing sacred about this island.

24
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,460
Saigo.

25
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,700
We should just give the island
to the Americans...

26
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,400
and then we can go home.

27
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,070
Saigo!

28
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,240
What did you say, soldier?

29
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,370
I said if we beat the Americans,
then we can go home.

30
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,680
You there, is that what he said?

31
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,420
Yes, sir.

32
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,330
I'm Kuribayashi.

33
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,240
Welcome, General.
I am Admiral Ohsugi.

34
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,940
How long have you been
waiting here for me?

35
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,450
Three hours, sir.

36
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,950
Sorry to hear that.

37
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,680
They wouldn't allow me to wire my arrival
after what happened to Admiral Yamamoto.

38
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,080
I understand, sir.

39
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,190
This is my aide, Lieutenant Fujita.

40
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,320
What's the matter, Admiral?
You don't look very well.

41
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,860
It's nothing, sir. The water
doesn't agree with me here.

42
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,520
Sorry to hear that.

43
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,690
This way to your quarters.

44
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,600
Admiral, I want to make a round
of the island first.

45
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,830
Shall I fetch a vehicle?

46
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,980
No, let's walk.

47
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,610
Walking is good for the health.

48
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,940
It might be just what you need, Ohsugi.

49
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,630
So that's Suribachi.

50
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,730
You unpatriotic...

51
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,810
no-good peasants!

52
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,510
Hey, stop it!

53
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,340
Stand up!

54
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,720
What are you doing?

55
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,760
These soldiers...

56
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,620
were conspiring
with unpatriotic words, sir.

57
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,790
I see.

58
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,660
And, Captain, do you have
such an excess of soldiers...

59
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,460
that you could put two
of them out of commission?

60
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,570
No, sir.

61
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,140
Then stop beating them.

62
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,810
Deny their lunch rations instead.

63
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,040
A good captain uses his brain,
not just his whip.

64
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,750
What is all this?

65
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,580
All this?

66
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,190
Trenches, sir.

67
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,660
Why are the men digging trenches here?

68
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,030
This is where the Americans
are expected to land.

69
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,600
Have them stop immediately.

70
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,840
But, General...

71
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,670
And, Captain...

72
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,500
make sure these men get proper breaks.

73
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,280
They look like they're from Mars.

74
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,250
Stop digging!

75
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,080
Just as well.

76
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,110
My stomach has been
bothering me anyway.

77
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,550
A toast to General Kuribayashi...

78
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,920
a fine commander.

79
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,590
Better than sake!

80
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,160
I heard he lived in America.

81
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,830
Maybe that's why he
doesn't want us digging trenches.

82
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,730
Maybe he likes Americans.

83
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,570
No, stupid.
He studied the Americans.

84
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,440
So now he knows how to beat them.

85
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,940
I heard from someone in the 204th...

86
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,250
that another general was
supposed to command the island...

87
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,080
but he didn't want the job.

88
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,590
So Premier Tojo gave it
to Kuribayashi instead.

89
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,870
Nozaki, you hear a lot of things...

90
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,460
but your ears are full of wax!

91
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,170
Anyway, you can't trust anyone
from the 204th.

92
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,210
They're part of the Navy.

93
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,540
I think this Kuribayashi
must be a superb general.

94
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,310
Look...

95
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,350
we're not digging those damn trenches
in the sand anymore, are we?

96
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,870
This heat is more than I had anticipated.

97
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:57,680
This island is bigger than I thought.
I'm exhausted.

98
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,490
Ito, reporting for duty.

99
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,690
Thank you for coming right away.

100
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,560
How much air force
do we have available?

101
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,360
41 Zekes and 13 bombers, sir.

102
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,530
Is that all?

103
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,770
In order to support Saipan,
we lost 66 planes a few days ago.

104
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,410
We will have to rely on support
from the Combined Fleet then.

105
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,380
Is this the current defense plan?

106
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,030
And what about the Army troops?
Where will they be stationed?

107
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,730
I don't know exactly.

108
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,770
They are under independent
command of Colonel Adachi.

109
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,300
You have not coordinated
your plans with the Army?

110
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,240
According to Navy rules,
until the enemy lands...

111
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,310
This is a real war!
You are aware of that, aren't you?

112
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,610
This will not work.

113
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,250
You are concentrating all
your efforts on the beaches.

114
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,850
- Move the artillery to higher ground.
- But, sir, we just had them...

115
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,620
moved down to the beaches.

116
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,260
Well, move them back.

117
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,220
Coordinate with the Army
and have them start immediately.

118
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,460
Fortifications at Suribachi are the priority.

119
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,230
I'm going to walk some more.

120
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,310
- It's pitch black out there, sir.
- I know.

121
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,810
This one is trouble.

122
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,120
Army commanders usually are, sir.

123
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,200
Another letter?

124
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,500
You know that the mail only goes out
when there's a boat available?

125
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,370
I have a lot of family.

126
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,710
Then how come all your letters
are addressed to your wife?

127
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,470
Nosey!

128
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,310
Here, let me do you a favor.

129
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,010
Otherwise, your letters
will never make it through.

130
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,880
Hey, what are you doing?

131
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,760
I used to work at the censorship office
in Tokyo before I was transferred.

132
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,520
You mean demoted.

133
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,020
"To Hanako: We soldiers dig.
We dig all day."

134
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,900
No, no, no. This will never pass.

135
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,500
Give me that back!

136
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,690
There. You'll thank me
for this later, Saigo.

137
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,680
Next!

138
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,430
Good!

139
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,590
Are you blind?

140
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,930
Can't you see the target?

141
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,600
Even my six-year-old could
shoot better than you do.

142
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,960
Do it again!

143
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,500
You're an embarrassment!
You call yourself an lmperial soldier?

144
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:24,010
Tonight you will clean the boots
of your entire troop.

145
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,280
Go to the rear!

146
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,420
They should learn to clean their guns
properly, rather than their boots.

147
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,830
What are those tanks doing here?

148
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,160
Those are out of commission, sir.
They are waiting for parts.

149
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,000
- For how long?
- About a month, sir.

150
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,230
Taro, America is filled with cars.

151
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,530
<i>I have to be very careful
when I cross the street...</i>

152
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,930
<i>there are so many cars everywhere.</i>

153
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
<i>Taro, are you behaving yourself
and listening to your mother?</i>

154
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,370
<i>I miss you.</i>

155
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,690
These civilians need to be
evacuated as soon as possible.

156
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,620
Yes, sir.

157
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,980
<i>Hanako...</i>

158
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,820
<i>we have a celebrity here.</i>

159
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,760
<i>Baron Nishi, the Olympic gold medalist
in horse jumping.</i>

160
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,960
<i>He will lead the 26th tank regiment...</i>

161
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,500
<i>and has just arrived from Tokyo.</i>

162
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,650
<i>Nishi is very handsome, and
there are rumors of his womanizing skills.</i>

163
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,160
<i>But there are no women
left on the island to woo.</i>

164
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,550
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi!
You brought your horse.

165
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,320
From Chichi Jima.

166
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,490
I used to be a cavalryman myself,
you know.

167
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,730
Of course, I know.

168
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,410
I've been looking forward
to serving under you.

169
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,500
One who understands horses
the way I do.

170
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,840
When we used to ride horses
through the battlefield...

171
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,880
those were the good old days...

172
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,340
not like these mechanized contraptions.

173
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,880
I could send for another horse...

174
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,250
and we could ride together.

175
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,090
I'm afraid my riding days are over.

176
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,460
But tell me about this famous horse
of yours that you won the Olympics with.

177
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,700
My stallion, Uranus.

178
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,210
Oh, yes, this horse has a fine back.

179
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,760
I bought him in Italy.

180
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,580
They were happy to get rid of him.

181
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,490
He was such a wild horse.

182
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,800
No one could tame the beast,
but I told them...

183
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,900
such a headstrong horse...

184
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,670
is a perfect match for me.

185
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,740
Come dine with me tonight.
I feel like having a drink.

186
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,140
I think that can be arranged.

187
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,290
How did you manage to get
the Johnnie Walker?

188
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,690
I drank some already.

189
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,840
I'm sorry. This is all we have.

190
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,130
That's fine, as long as we have this.

191
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,280
What is this empty plate?

192
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,940
I have told our cook that all officers will
have the same rations and food as our men.

193
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,180
I'm sorry, but serving three dishes
is regulation.

194
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,960
Oh, but of course we have the right to be
served more than three dishes per meal.

195
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,360
You're absolutely right.

196
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,340
When you think about it...

197
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:59,010
it is regrettable that most of the
Combined Fleet was destroyed.

198
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,350
We still have some battleships left...

199
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,510
but we have very little striking power
from the air or sea.

200
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,150
Nishi, what do you mean?

201
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,090
So you have not heard about
the Mariana battle?

202
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Admiral Ozawa's carrier and boat planes
were destroyed.

203
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,170
The lmperial headquarters...

204
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,710
is deceiving not just the people,
but us as well.

205
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,880
If you want my honest opinion, General...

206
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,520
the best thing to do...

207
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,880
would be to sink the island
to the bottom of the sea.

208
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,230
And yet, you still came?

209
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,460
Well...

210
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,900
I figured your men were going to need
all the tanks that I could bring.

211
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,320
This must be it.

212
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,690
Yes, the enemy must land here.

213
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,220
Run!

214
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,890
Like you were one of the Americans!

215
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,040
Go on! Which direction would you take?

216
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,160
Hey...

217
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,360
I think your general has gone mad.

218
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,070
Look at the gun he has.

219
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,670
He probably took it
from a dead American.

220
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,220
Maybe.

221
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,630
Break time is over.

222
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,590
Back to work!

223
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,960
Are you all right, Kashiwara?

224
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,200
You look pale.

225
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,070
I'm fine. It's just the damn water.

226
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,580
But... l... really... need to go.

227
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,230
There will be a major change
in our strategy.

228
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,640
We will dig caves in the Motoyama,
Higashiyama, and Suribachi-yama areas.

229
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,580
We will build these underground
fortifications, and fight to the end.

230
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,080
- What about the beach defenses, sir?
- Not needed.

231
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,250
But, sir, the beach trenches
are our first line of defense.

232
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,790
Without the beach trenches,
how do you expect us to win?

233
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,950
Hayashi, do you know how many cars
America produces in a year?

234
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,290
Five million.

235
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,830
The Americans' technological advancements
cannot be underestimated.

236
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,800
They will cross the beaches eventually.

237
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,900
If we waste our soldiers there,
there is no hope for victory.

238
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,840
It is inevitable that men will die...

239
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,680
but I never heard of an island operation
without beach fortifications.

240
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,480
General, it will be a futile waste of time
to start digging tunnels now.

241
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,280
We should force the enemy
near the island...

242
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,620
and launch a pincer drive
from the sea and air.

243
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,160
I agree. That makes the most sense.

244
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,450
Ohsugi...

245
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,190
doesn't the Navy know?

246
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:48,730
The Combined Fleet has been completely
destroyed off the Marianas.

247
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,030
The island is now isolated.

248
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,310
What's more, I received a new order from
the lmperial headquarters this morning.

249
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,880
The remaining fighter planes are to be
sent back to Tokyo to defend the mainland.

250
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,080
Outrageous! How are we to fight?

251
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,760
We do not have time for discussion.
We should head back.

252
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,920
<i>Dear Mother...</i>

253
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,800
<i>I have been commissioned
to a new troop today.</i>

254
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:00,060
<i>I cannot talk about this transfer now.</i>

255
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,370
<i>Take good care of yourself.</i>

256
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,890
Look at this picture.

257
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,830
That's some fancy castle.

258
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,800
You know who this castle was built for?

259
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,430
Someone who was already dead.

260
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,000
They must have had
a lot of money back then...

261
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,640
to build a castle like that
for a dead person.

262
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,480
Why are you reading that book anyway?

263
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,780
We're never going to war over there.

264
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,050
We'll be lucky if we even get
a hole in the ground when we're dead.

265
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,780
Don't talk about that. It's bad luck.

266
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,260
Is this the 312th?

267
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,000
That's right.

268
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,460
I'm Nozaki. This is Saigo.

269
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,800
Shimizu, you can put your bedroll there.

270
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,150
There's an empty space in the back.

271
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,010
Don't mind him.

272
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:23,720
His friend Kashiwara just died.

273
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,390
That used to be his spot.

274
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,000
But we are all going to die.

275
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,800
That's the plan, isn't it?

276
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,030
For our country, it is an honor.

277
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,650
Kashiwara died of honorable dysentery.

278
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,750
Shimizu, where are you from?

279
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,350
Kanagawa-ken.

280
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,080
Ozawa is from there, aren't you?

281
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,490
That's right.

282
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,060
Where were you trained?

283
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,770
Maybe we were at the same school?

284
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,900
No.

285
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,770
I trained in Tokyo.

286
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,540
I trained in Tokyo, too. Where?

287
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,120
<i>The Koho Kimmu Yoin Yoseijo.</i>

288
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,200
Hey...

289
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,940
<i>why do you think they put
a Kempeitai in our unit?</i>

290
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,470
I don't know.

291
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,980
<i>He's not wearing the white armband.
He's not Kempeitai.</i>

292
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,950
He went to the Kempeitai
military academy.

293
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,990
Maybe he was kicked out.

294
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,890
<i>He acts like aKempeitai.</i>

295
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,930
Look at his holster.
That's not standard issue.

296
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,440
He's been put here to spy on us.

297
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,670
Why would he spy on us?

298
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,140
Maybe it's those letters
you've been writing.

299
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,080
You should be careful.

300
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,810
Weed soup again?

301
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:07,380
Kuribayashi is conserving
our food supplies for the battle.

302
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,020
We'll be dead
before the Americans even get here.

303
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,990
And you would think that with all my
war effort contributions...

304
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,830
<i>we should be eating kasutera cakes
or sandwiches.</i>

305
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,400
What?

306
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:29,410
I ran a bakery in Ohmiya with my wife.

307
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,680
Back when we could still get sugar...

308
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:37,740
<i>we sold ampan and kasutera cakes.</i>

309
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,560
<i>However, his Kempeitai brethren...</i>

310
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,000
used to come and take
whatever they wanted.

311
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,070
For the war...

312
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,710
For the country...

313
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,740
Why bread?

314
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:14,220
We ran into those types
at our clothing store as well.

315
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,860
When we started making sandwiches...

316
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,560
they took those, too.

317
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,230
And when we ran out of meat
and just had bread, they still came.

318
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,740
Eventually, they took all of our
baking equipment for the metal...

319
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,540
and we were out of business.

320
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,250
I should have been a fisherman.

321
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,820
It must have been hard on your wife...

322
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,260
without the shop
and without her husband.

323
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:37,930
Tell them to go away.
We have nothing to sell.

324
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,710
Congratulations! Your husband
is going to war.

325
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,230
Thank you very much.

326
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,730
I'm happy to serve the country.

327
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,330
Prayers for your eternal success at arms.

328
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:21,370
I beg of you! We have only each other.

329
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,580
This is not the time.

330
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:34,320
We have all sent our husbands
and sons to war.

331
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,360
We all have to do our part.

332
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,000
At least you'll have a little one
to carry on your name.

333
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,850
I can't eat with you like that.

334
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:09,160
What am I going to do after you die?

335
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,770
I'm not in the coffin yet.

336
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,340
The men never come home,
not even a soul.

337
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,020
They'll never let you come home.

338
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,450
Don't worry.

339
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,580
And now, with the baby.

340
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,580
Can you hear me?

341
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,620
It's Dad.

342
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,650
Listen.

343
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:15,320
Don't tell anyone
what I'm telling you now.

344
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,790
It's a secret.

345
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,240
Your dad...

346
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,110
is going to come home for you.

347
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,570
Hurry up!

348
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,540
The enemy approaches!

349
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,660
This is ridiculous!

350
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,530
Why waste time digging these tunnels?

351
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,260
They are all going to die anyway.

352
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:05,430
At least he conceded
to the pillboxes on the beach.

353
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,080
You wanted to see me, sir?

354
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,780
Care for a drink?

355
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,560
You have been looking
quite pale these days.

356
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,900
It's the water. It has
never agreed with me.

357
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,530
That's not good.

358
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,100
Why don't you go back
to the mainland to recoup?

359
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,880
I have commissioned Admiral Ichimaru
to take your place.

360
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,880
We are wasting time
digging these tunnels.

361
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:58,720
General, the island won't last
five days without fleet support.

362
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:02,660
We should fight to the death.

363
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,430
The tunnel-digging may be futile.

364
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,140
Maybe the stand on lwo will be futile.

365
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,800
Maybe the whole war is futile.

366
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,640
But will you give up then?

367
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,110
We will defend this island
until we are dead!

368
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,510
Until the very last soldier is dead!

369
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:27,690
If our children can live safely
for one more day...

370
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,080
it would be worth the one more day
that we defend this island!

371
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,190
Ohsugi...

372
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:37,790
if you have an ounce
of pride left as an officer...

373
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,000
I beg of you...

374
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,760
go back to headquarters
and ask them to send support.

375
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,190
So the rumor is true?
I couldn't believe it.

376
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:17,470
I'm grateful to be leaving this island.

377
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,200
We may have had our differences...

378
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,240
but I'm truly sorry to see you go.

379
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,910
General Hayashi, it is up to you now.

380
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,390
Kuribayashi belongs behind a desk,
not commanding war.

381
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,520
I understand.

382
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,390
There are many of us
who agree with you, sir.

383
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,500
Listen.

384
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:02,710
The Americans are likely to land here.

385
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,620
Crossfire positions will be here...

386
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,780
here...

387
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,080
and here.

388
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,790
The fact is...

389
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:20,260
we are completely
outnumbered in every sector.

390
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,060
But we have a great advantage.

391
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,630
Can anyone tell me what that is?

392
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,240
The Americans are weak-willed
and inferior to Japanese soldiers.

393
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,880
Very good, Shimizu.

394
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,280
Why is that?

395
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,150
They are not as disciplined...

396
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,050
and they let their emotions
interfere with their duty.

397
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,490
That is correct.

398
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,160
Here is the uniform
of an American medic.

399
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,900
He should be your target.

400
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,800
For Americans will risk the lives
of many soldiers to save this one.

401
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,800
Understood?

402
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,290
General, may I speak with you?

403
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,130
Please keep an eye on
Major General Hayashi.

404
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:26,600
Thank you for your concern, Nishi...

405
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,960
but we don't have any time to waste.

406
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,540
We must think about what
we can do at this moment.

407
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,310
Admiral Ichimaru.

408
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,350
Reporting for duty, sir.

409
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:45,980
Excuse me.

410
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,980
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

411
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,600
Jupiter!

412
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:52,740
Jupiter.

413
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,190
Yamazaki...

414
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:49,360
what are you doing just
sitting there? Help us...

415
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,180
I think he's writing about us in his reports.

416
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,040
He's just writing a letter.

417
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:38,420
It's been two months, Nozaki.

418
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,680
He would have reported us by now.

419
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,580
How can you be sure?

420
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,400
Will they ever stop?

421
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:57,890
Day and night, day and night...

422
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:02,240
It's driving me crazy!

423
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:07,450
If the damn Americans
are going to invade...

424
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,280
why don't they hurry up and land?

425
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,260
<i>Tako-Chan...</i>

426
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,590
<i>the four chicks that were born
two months ago have grown so much.</i>

427
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:36,100
<i>The mother chicken leads them
for food every day...</i>

428
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:40,770
<i>but they're giving me a hard time, picking
at the vegetable garden I have grown.</i>

429
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:49,090
The fleet of American ships
has left Saipan.

430
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,160
So they are on their way.

431
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,600
Ready the troops.

432
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,500
Men...

433
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,830
the time has come
to show your true colors.

434
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:47,140
As a member of the honorable
lmperial Army...

435
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,350
I trust that you will fight with honor.

436
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:57,550
This island is of utmost importance
to Japan.

437
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,220
<i>Should the island fall...</i>

438
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:04,190
the enemy...

439
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:09,200
will use it as their base
to attack our homeland.

440
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,200
For the mainland...

441
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:15,230
For our homeland...

442
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,210
Until the very last man.

443
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,240
<i>Our duty is to stop the enemy right here.</i>

444
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,120
<i>Not one of you...</i>

445
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,950
is allowed to die until you have killed
10 enemy soldiers.

446
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:36,360
Do not expect to return home alive.

447
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:42,970
I will always be in front of you.

448
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,770
Long live the Emperor.

449
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:41,190
<i>Take care and be well.</i>

450
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:47,830
<i>I will fight courageously until the end,
in the spirit of Yamato.</i>

451
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,370
<i>My heart will always be with you.</i>

452
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:55,670
<i>Takeichi.</i>

453
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:17,460
<i>Every household is assigned a quota...
of bag-making for the gunpowder.</i>

454
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:22,730
<i>I cannot help but get tense when I think
that these will be used in battle.</i>

455
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:26,560
<i>Taro and Yoko laugh at me for this.</i>

456
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:30,810
<i>Takako, on evacuation in Nagano,
is also doing well.</i>

457
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,740
<i>I pray for your safety.</i>

458
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,150
<i>Sincerely, Yoshi.</i>

459
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,760
No one can shoot me now.

460
00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:01,000
That's a nice belt.
My wife sent me one, too.

461
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:09,910
<i>Doesn't look like Mr. Kempeitai
has a thousand-stitch belt, does he?</i>

462
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,780
Maybe he thinks it will clash
with his uniform.

463
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:15,510
He probably doesn't believe
in superstitions, anyway.

464
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,760
His mother made him one after all.

465
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:49,020
- Maybe they're trying to sink the island.
- My head hurts.

466
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,280
How many ships do you think
there are out there?

467
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:56,160
At least 30. Maybe even 50.

468
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,090
- They must be really close.
- I need to take a leak.

469
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:02,000
Don't go near the sewers.
Dysentery is spreading through there.

470
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:03,330
Where do I go then?

471
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:05,660
There is a pot at the end of the cave.

472
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,890
The shit pot is full.

473
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,160
Someone needs to throw it out.

474
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,120
If anything happens to that pot...

475
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:02,460
you'll be carrying our shit away
with your hands.

476
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,330
Is this some kind of a joke?

477
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:14,830
Why are you always picking on me?

478
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:58,270
Thank you, God. I take back
what I said before.

479
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:14,820
Shall we commence fire?

480
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,290
Not yet.

481
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,000
The men wish to commence firing.

482
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:32,840
Hold your fire!

483
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,510
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

484
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:39,180
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

485
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:50,250
They will take the beach
in no time if we do not resist.

486
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:52,420
Wait until the beach is full.

487
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,020
Let's go. Commence firing!

488
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,400
Commence firing!

489
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:27,970
<i>Commence firing!</i>

490
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,120
The guns of the Kitakubo unit
were destroyed.

491
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,630
All the pillbox units on the beach
have been destroyed.

492
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,700
However, all other forces are intact...

493
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:39,130
and we estimate more than
1,000 enemy casualties.

494
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,040
The pillbox destruction was unavoidable.

495
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,540
Overall, that is good news.

496
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:46,710
How are the men
holding up at Suribachi?

497
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,180
Forces are intact.

498
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:54,350
What is the enemy situation?

499
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,510
Approximately 20,000 men and 80 tanks.

500
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,160
There has to be more than that.
They still have men waiting in the boats.

501
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,850
Currently the enemy front extends...

502
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:08,030
between Suribachi
and the south landing...

503
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:10,830
and Chidori airfield south.

504
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:15,700
Just as I thought... Suribachi
and the Motoyama airfield.

505
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,970
They are making a two-pronged attack.

506
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,490
That's not enough! I need more ammo.

507
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,050
Take his place!

508
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,580
- The machine gun is blasted.
- Use your rifle!

509
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,720
Watch out! lmbecile!

510
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,030
I can't rely on you.

511
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,400
Go send a report to Colonel Adachi
that we need another machine gun.

512
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,070
Hurry up!

513
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,760
Colonel Adachi is asking
for reinforcements.

514
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:51,430
We can't afford to send reinforcements.
Tell him to hold out.

515
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,110
Shoot him!

516
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:14,460
- What's the matter?
- We're out of bullets!

517
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:35,140
We are losing Suribachi.

518
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:40,320
All is lost. Request permission
to lead a suicide mission.

519
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:43,810
No. You must try to hold them off.

520
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:48,390
Do what you can to survive
and join forces in the north caves.

521
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,290
But, sir...

522
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,900
I have failed to hold Suribachi.

523
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:57,070
Permit me to die with honor with my men.

524
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,560
No, Colonel.

525
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,570
<i>This is an order!</i>

526
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:07,170
Adachi.

527
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:10,510
Adachi!

528
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:27,460
Sir, Captain Tanida
requests machine guns.

529
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,900
It's over.

530
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,240
Suicide...

531
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,580
That's the only thing left.

532
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,510
But...

533
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:49,850
Here, take this to your commander.

534
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,430
I heard General Kuribayashi
order Colonel Adachi to escape.

535
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,630
Quiet!

536
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:46,440
Escape is the coward's way.

537
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:48,840
Sit down!

538
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:02,090
Men...

539
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,020
we are...

540
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:11,200
honorable soldiers of the Emperor.

541
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:16,470
Don't ever forget that.

542
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,550
The only way left for us...

543
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,380
is to die with honor.

544
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,650
This is our fate...

545
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:35,660
to find our place at Yasukuni Shrine.

546
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:42,390
I'll see you there.

547
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:04,180
Soldiers, farewell!

548
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:00,530
Stop!

549
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:11,710
You should die like an honorable soldier.

550
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:14,140
Look, Shimizu...

551
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:19,690
we can still join the troops
in the northern caves.

552
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:23,320
Our orders are to stay here until death.

553
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,330
I heard General Kuribayashi himself.

554
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:28,130
That's what he said...

555
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,300
over the radio.

556
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:34,000
It's true.

557
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,340
We can die here...

558
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:44,510
or we can continue fighting.

559
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,820
Which would better serve the Emperor?

560
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:55,180
Which one?

561
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:18,750
Where does this go?

562
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,220
It will take us closer to Motoyama.

563
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:29,120
Do you have orders to move back?

564
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,530
Where are the rest of your men?

565
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:34,360
All dead.

566
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,770
It's the same with us.

567
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:48,040
There should be an outlet
somewhere near here.

568
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,410
Be quiet!

569
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:41,960
So you thought you could blow us up,
or burn us alive, did you?

570
01:10:57,650 --> 01:10:59,980
- Have we heard from Suribachi?
- No, sir.

571
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:01,680
Send a messenger!

572
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:13,650
Lieutenant Oiso has ordered us
to rendezvous at the east cave.

573
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,810
We will make a run for Motoyama.

574
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:28,140
There is no cover for two kilometers.

575
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,510
It will be every man for himself.

576
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:40,020
See you on the other side.

577
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:44,490
If not on this earth,
then in the next world.

578
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:02,110
Don't run with the herd.
That's where the enemy will fire.

579
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,510
Stay back.

580
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,680
That's cowardice!

581
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:11,150
There is no use for a dead soldier.

582
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,250
Wait until the flare is gone.

583
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:11,110
Crawl forward.

584
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,130
What happened to the messenger?

585
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:32,770
He never came back.

586
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,370
I will go to Adachi myself.

587
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,770
Motoyama's transmitter
still works, General.

588
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:44,920
Why not try there, sir?

589
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:08,000
Sir, these men retreated
from Mt. Suribachi.

590
01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:16,480
What are your names?

591
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:19,310
Saigo, from the 312th.

592
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:21,480
Shimizu, reporting for duty.

593
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:25,650
You escaped from Suribachi?

594
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:34,160
How dare you!

595
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:39,000
It was your duty
to stay in your position until death.

596
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,870
You should have died...

597
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:46,180
with your fellow troop members.

598
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:51,210
You are both a disgrace.

599
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:56,840
Get on your knees.

600
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:02,190
- But, sir...
- I said, get on your knees!

601
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:24,850
I don't want you to kill
my soldiers needlessly.

602
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:28,110
Put down your sword.

603
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:29,950
Put it down!

604
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,890
What's going on here?

605
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:44,430
These men ran from Suribachi.

606
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:51,770
Lt. Ito, I gave the order that all survivors
retreat to the north caves.

607
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:55,770
I am very sorry, General.

608
01:15:58,050 --> 01:15:59,280
It's just...

609
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:02,050
Suribachi...

610
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:05,820
has fallen.

611
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:28,810
Now that Suribachi has been taken...

612
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,380
the enemy will maneuver all forces
onto the hillside.

613
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:33,580
We must move
our command center north, sir.

614
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,080
Ito...

615
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:45,420
fight for your fallen brethren...

616
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,960
until the end.

617
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,990
Get up!

618
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:19,320
Major General Hayashi
is leading an attack.

619
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,090
We are to join him.

620
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:27,040
Kuribayashi's orders are
to remain in the caves.

621
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:33,840
Lieutenant lto says Kuribayashi
is a weak American sympathizer.

622
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,590
We will take back Mt. Suribachi.

623
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:10,740
Where is Major General Hayashi?

624
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,680
We don't know, sir.

625
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,750
Who is in charge here?

626
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:18,890
I'm not sure.

627
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:24,390
Stay here until
I determine the plan of action.

628
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,650
We're dead.

629
01:18:57,630 --> 01:18:59,760
Pull back!

630
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,130
We'll get reinforcements.

631
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:39,300
Why didn't your regiment join the attack?

632
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,040
Don't sit here like rats!

633
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:49,510
Come out of your caves and fight!

634
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,880
Where is your commander?

635
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:54,920
We haven't received the order to attack.

636
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:01,360
Didn't you receive the order
from General Hayashi?

637
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,860
Kuribayashi countermanded
Hayashi's order.

638
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,330
There is to be no attack.

639
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,170
We will take back Suribachi...

640
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:16,730
with or without Kuribayashi.

641
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:20,670
There are already troops on the attack.
Get your men in order.

642
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:23,470
Lieutenant, may I remind you
of your rank!

643
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,050
Your disrespect for senior officers...

644
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:29,680
puts your men at needless risk.

645
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,720
I suggest you go back to your cave...

646
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:37,760
or hand over your men.

647
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:49,200
Enough.

648
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:51,340
We'll do it ourselves.

649
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:03,820
That's against regulations.

650
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:07,750
That's the officer who tried to kill us.
He doesn't care.

651
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,290
I won't go back.

652
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:45,520
I've had enough of cave fighting.

653
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:50,630
You men are now under
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi's command.

654
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,580
I will throw myself under an enemy tank.

655
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:10,710
I will take out one of their machines.

656
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:40,580
Hurry.

657
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:44,390
What is the status?

658
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:47,920
A thousand men were lost...

659
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:49,990
in a night attack along Chidori airfield.

660
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,930
Why? I have given them strict orders
not to kill themselves.

661
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:56,860
It seems that the order to retreat
was not conveyed to all sectors.

662
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,000
Hayashi.

663
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:00,840
Damn you!

664
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,400
And the American advancement?

665
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:07,780
A battalion is headed north and we
are fighting back along the west ridge.

666
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:12,210
Good. Once they cross the west ridge,
they will be surrounded on three sides.

667
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:14,920
This just arrived.

668
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:16,210
Read it.

669
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:22,720
From headquarters...

670
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:29,560
"We regret that we are unable to send
reinforcements to lwo at this time.

671
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:34,460
We earnestly hope you will
fight honorably...

672
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,440
and die for your country."

673
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:20,600
Bring him in.

674
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:37,420
Bring him in.

675
01:25:47,870 --> 01:25:50,030
Shall I finish him off?

676
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,770
No. Treat him.

677
01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:55,440
But, sir...

678
01:25:55,610 --> 01:25:58,240
Okubo, you would expect the same,
wouldn't you?

679
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:59,710
Endo, treat him.

680
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,920
We are low on morphine as it is.

681
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:07,220
Sir, the Americans would not treat
a wounded Japanese soldier.

682
01:26:07,390 --> 01:26:10,360
Son, have you ever met one?

683
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,020
Treat him.

684
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,600
Where are you, American tanks?

685
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:55,300
Come and get me!

686
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,580
How is the prisoner doing?

687
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:14,420
He is awake, sir.

688
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:21,530
I will question the prisoner
for information.

689
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:09,300
Damn.

690
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,170
I've had enough of this.

691
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:15,470
I'm going to surrender.

692
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:22,120
Go ahead and arrest me.

693
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:27,120
I don't care anymore. That's what
you were put here for, isn't it?

694
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:31,000
To report treasonous thoughts.

695
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,300
I was put here because...

696
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:40,860
<i>I was discharged from the Kempeitai.</i>

697
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:45,300
Discharged?

698
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:53,210
I had only been in service
for five days.

699
01:29:56,490 --> 01:29:57,550
Shimizu...

700
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:00,490
you must always be firm.

701
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:05,820
Any mercy and people
will take advantage of you.

702
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:12,500
That's unpatriotic.

703
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,330
Go sort it out, Shimizu.

704
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:29,850
You do not have the lmperial flag
properly displayed.

705
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:31,250
I'm sorry.

706
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:34,950
My husband has gone to war
and I couldn't put it up myself.

707
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:37,820
It is unpatriotic
not to have the flag displayed.

708
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,260
If you help me, I'll put it up now.

709
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:02,720
Get that dog to shut up.

710
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:05,480
What was that, sir?

711
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:10,890
That dog is a nuisance.
It is disruptive of Army communications.

712
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:13,520
I am very sorry, sir.

713
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:22,000
Shimizu. Dispose of the dog.

714
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:26,870
We can't have a dog interfering
with important military commands.

715
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:34,280
Take the dog in the back.

716
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:35,980
It's only a dog.

717
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:38,780
It won't happen again.

718
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:40,660
Take it out back.

719
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,820
Keep the children inside.

720
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,260
Hurry up.

721
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:35,880
Take the dog into the house
and keep him quiet...

722
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:37,600
and never let him out.

723
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:51,320
It's taken care of, sir.

724
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:31,600
Are you trying to make a fool out of me?

725
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:38,770
If you can't even shoot a dog,
you'll never be able to handle the Reds.

726
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:41,940
You are unpatriotic!

727
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:50,550
I was discharged for insubordination...

728
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:53,450
and sent here.

729
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:04,030
Don't look so glum, Shimizu.

730
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:08,200
At least now only the enemy hates you.

731
01:34:13,310 --> 01:34:15,070
I don't blame the dog.

732
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,000
<i>Taro...</i>

733
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:45,340
<i>tonight I attended my farewell party.</i>

734
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:48,500
<i>The wives also attended,
so there was a lot of fuss.</i>

735
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:51,620
<i>Greeting all the ladies...</i>

736
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:54,980
<i>kept me from enjoying the food.</i>

737
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,110
Is there any information
of the enemy's plan?

738
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:45,120
No, it's just a letter.

739
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:48,790
It's from his mother.

740
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:52,320
"Sam...

741
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,730
I have mailed you
a couple of books to read.

742
01:37:56,330 --> 01:37:57,860
I hope that you like them.

743
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:00,260
Yesterday...

744
01:38:01,010 --> 01:38:05,770
the dogs dug a hole under the fence.

745
01:38:07,150 --> 01:38:11,380
They ran all over the neighborhood.

746
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,680
By the time we found them...

747
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:20,880
the Harrisons' roosters were terrorized.

748
01:38:21,690 --> 01:38:24,530
Don't worry about us.

749
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:29,860
Just take care of yourself
and come back safely.

750
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:33,970
Remember what I said to you...

751
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:39,200
always do what is right...

752
01:38:40,310 --> 01:38:42,510
because it is right.

753
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:47,340
I pray for a speedy end to the war...

754
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,920
and your safe return.

755
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:51,850
Love, Mom."

756
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:29,120
I'm sorry, sir. There is no more medicine.

757
01:39:29,290 --> 01:39:32,460
It's all right. I'm useless now.
Go help the others!

758
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:05,850
Okubo, come here.

759
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,330
How are we on ammunition?

760
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,840
Not good, sir.

761
01:41:20,370 --> 01:41:22,340
Our mortars have been taken out...

762
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:25,010
and we're out of machine gun ammo.

763
01:41:26,810 --> 01:41:30,140
We have only our rifles.

764
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:33,210
Okubo...

765
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:37,180
you are now in charge of the men.

766
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:43,520
We can no longer hold this area.

767
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:47,750
You must guide
the rest of the men north.

768
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:53,840
Take whatever food and ammo
we have left.

769
01:41:55,010 --> 01:41:57,370
What about you, sir?

770
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:04,210
I'm tired of sharing this cave
with all of you.

771
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:07,570
I'm a one-man show from here on out.

772
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:09,680
What are you talking about, sir?

773
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:14,350
Your first order of business...

774
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:17,120
is to find some water.

775
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:45,280
Men...

776
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:48,390
do your best.

777
01:42:49,890 --> 01:42:54,300
Do what is right...

778
01:42:56,130 --> 01:42:58,400
because it is right.

779
01:43:00,570 --> 01:43:01,800
Understood?

780
01:43:09,610 --> 01:43:14,570
I will make sure that they send you
medicine and food.

781
01:43:16,820 --> 01:43:18,150
It has been a great honor...

782
01:43:19,590 --> 01:43:20,820
to serve...

783
01:43:22,130 --> 01:43:23,590
under you.

784
01:44:02,730 --> 01:44:04,290
Hand me my rifle.

785
01:44:28,090 --> 01:44:29,990
I'm sorry, Okubo.

786
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:53,300
Why am I not getting any reports?
Have we heard from Admiral Ichimaru?

787
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:56,240
- No, sir.
- What about Nishi or Hayashi?

788
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,740
- Send out messengers!
- We have. Many times.

789
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:03,720
None of them have come back.

790
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:05,980
You can't plan strategy like this!

791
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:20,660
I have been thinking about
what Lt. Colonel Nishi said.

792
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:22,840
He's right.

793
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:31,010
I don't know anything about the enemy.

794
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:35,450
I believed that the Americans
were cowards...

795
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:43,360
but they weren't.

796
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,760
I was taught...

797
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:54,130
that they were savages...

798
01:46:55,940 --> 01:46:57,910
but that American soldier...

799
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:07,540
his mother's words...

800
01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:13,620
were the same as my mother's.

801
01:47:14,830 --> 01:47:18,820
I want to fulfill my duty
for the general...

802
01:47:19,730 --> 01:47:21,890
and our country...

803
01:47:23,630 --> 01:47:25,760
but I don't want to die for nothing.

804
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:33,140
What do you think?

805
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:46,450
You...

806
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:50,520
haven't lived enough to realize...

807
01:47:55,370 --> 01:47:57,830
what you are sacrificing.

808
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:08,370
Will you surrender with me?

809
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:31,130
Careful.

810
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:38,540
They'll notice if we leave together.
You go first.

811
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:41,270
I'll make up an excuse.

812
01:48:41,450 --> 01:48:44,070
After a while, I'll tell them
I'm going to check on you.

813
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:46,240
We'll be gone before they even notice.

814
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:51,680
Pretend that you have dysentery.

815
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:54,750
Give me your dysentery look.

816
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:06,360
I guess that'll have to do.

817
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:16,900
Where are you going?

818
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:18,880
I've got dysentery.

819
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:21,280
You're going to surrender, aren't you?

820
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:23,550
If you are, take me with you.

821
01:49:24,190 --> 01:49:26,780
- I've had enough of this war.
- Be quiet!

822
01:49:35,270 --> 01:49:37,760
Where are you going?

823
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,470
He said he wasn't feeling well.
It could be dysentery.

824
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:41,900
You two! Stop!

825
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:48,980
Sir, maybe they got spooked.

826
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:08,730
Miura, you're on guard.

827
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,390
Make sure we have no more deserters.

828
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:39,320
What unit were you with?

829
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:46,060
Higashiyama 314th.

830
01:51:55,770 --> 01:51:57,210
Did you hear...

831
01:51:58,910 --> 01:52:02,500
I heard that they would give you a meal.

832
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:05,740
A meal...

833
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:11,620
That sounds good.

834
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:18,290
I'm from Yokohama, too.

835
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:25,030
After this is over, you can come visit me.

836
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:42,540
Lieutenant!

837
01:54:24,190 --> 01:54:25,990
Let this be a lesson to anyone else...

838
01:54:28,230 --> 01:54:29,850
who wants to surrender.

839
01:55:42,770 --> 01:55:46,630
We need to get through the crossfire
to reach the north...

840
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:49,200
and join our forces at the front.

841
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:56,340
Listen.

842
01:55:57,410 --> 01:55:59,910
We'll head for that cave
and make our way from there.

843
01:56:03,450 --> 01:56:05,010
Don't waste a bullet!

844
01:56:06,190 --> 01:56:07,620
Not a single one.

845
01:56:08,190 --> 01:56:09,750
Don't shoot recklessly.

846
01:57:10,420 --> 01:57:14,480
These are Nishi's troops
and the survivors from Suribachi.

847
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:20,560
Are there no officers?

848
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:26,670
You all did a good job making it here.

849
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:29,400
Fujita, water for them.

850
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:36,950
I'm sorry, sir. There is no more water.

851
01:57:40,780 --> 01:57:41,880
I'm sorry.

852
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:44,550
At least you can rest.

853
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:01,360
You look familiar.

854
01:58:06,610 --> 01:58:08,200
You almost lost your head.

855
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:15,310
That was the second time you saved me.

856
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:19,550
The first time...

857
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:23,890
was the day you landed on the island.

858
01:58:27,660 --> 01:58:29,600
Of course. I remember.

859
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:32,900
Well, everything happens in threes.

860
01:58:49,590 --> 01:58:50,920
<i>Hanako...</i>

861
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:54,360
<i>This letter will probably
never get to you...</i>

862
01:58:55,090 --> 01:58:56,080
<i>but...</i>

863
01:58:56,790 --> 01:58:59,020
<i>it comforts me to write.</i>

864
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:03,020
<i>For five days, we've been
without water and food.</i>

865
01:59:04,330 --> 01:59:06,100
<i>To survive...</i>

866
01:59:07,870 --> 01:59:09,930
<i>we do unspeakable things.</i>

867
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:14,770
<i>There is no escape now.</i>

868
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:16,710
<i>But...</i>

869
01:59:17,950 --> 01:59:20,780
<i>my only concern is for you and the baby.</i>

870
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:28,880
Dig up some worms.

871
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:50,670
<i>The battle is approaching its end...</i>

872
01:59:51,250 --> 01:59:53,980
<i>and there is no more ammunition,
no more water.</i>

873
01:59:54,150 --> 01:59:57,640
<i>All the survivors will engage
in a general attack.</i>

874
01:59:58,990 --> 02:00:02,430
<i>I pray for the victory
and safety of the Empire.</i>

875
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:05,150
<i>I bid you farewell.</i>

876
02:00:06,830 --> 02:00:10,890
<i>For the country,
I could not fulfill all of my duties.</i>

877
02:00:11,070 --> 02:00:15,000
<i>Now that we have no ammunition,
it is with regret that we must perish.</i>

878
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:24,670
You made it all the way from Suribachi?

879
02:00:27,580 --> 02:00:29,780
That must have been quite a journey.

880
02:00:35,530 --> 02:00:37,120
You are quite a soldier.

881
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:40,860
No, sir.

882
02:00:41,930 --> 02:00:43,260
I'm just a simple baker.

883
02:00:44,070 --> 02:00:45,860
You were a baker?

884
02:00:47,370 --> 02:00:48,430
Any family?

885
02:00:49,470 --> 02:00:50,770
A wife...

886
02:00:51,370 --> 02:00:55,940
and a baby girl born
last summer in Ohmiya.

887
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:01,040
I haven't met her yet.

888
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:08,720
It's strange.

889
02:01:11,290 --> 02:01:14,820
I promised myself to fight
until death for my family...

890
02:01:16,730 --> 02:01:21,070
but the thought of my family
makes it difficult to keep that promise.

891
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:46,430
A radio transmission from the homeland.

892
02:02:00,110 --> 02:02:01,580
<i>For General Kuribayashi...</i>

893
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:06,110
<i>and his troops, who are fighting bravely
for our country...</i>

894
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:10,880
<i>a song will be sung by the children
of Nagano...
which is Kuribayashi's hometown.</i>

895
02:02:11,220 --> 02:02:15,350
<i>On the waves of the Pacific</i>

896
02:02:15,530 --> 02:02:18,790
<i>down south from the Imperial City</i>

897
02:02:19,330 --> 02:02:23,990
<i>a small lonely island floats</i>

898
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:31,030
<i>The fate of our Imperial country</i>

899
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:35,870
<i>lies in the hands of this island</i>

900
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:41,310
<i>lwo Jima</i>

901
02:02:44,850 --> 02:02:48,350
<i>As long as we stand</i>

902
02:02:48,830 --> 02:02:52,920
<i>we shall feel safe, as the Imperial land</i>

903
02:02:53,100 --> 02:02:57,760
<i>shall forever be at peace</i>

904
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:05,700
<i>We shall fight with pride
and honor at any price</i>

905
02:03:08,110 --> 02:03:11,670
<i>Our proud island</i>

906
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:14,940
<i>lwo Jima</i>

907
02:03:37,270 --> 02:03:38,600
Do me a favor.

908
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:44,040
Stay here and burn all these documents,
and my military chest.

909
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:47,380
Everything happens in threes.

910
02:04:16,850 --> 02:04:18,870
We will make a general attack.

911
02:04:19,950 --> 02:04:22,280
Although Japan has lost...

912
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:24,880
one day...

913
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:27,880
our people will praise your dedication.

914
02:04:29,030 --> 02:04:33,050
A day will come when they
will weep and pray for your souls.

915
02:04:35,770 --> 02:04:38,060
Be proud to die for your country.

916
02:04:45,210 --> 02:04:47,700
I will always be in front of you.

917
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:31,750
No more.

918
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:34,950
No more.

919
02:07:43,030 --> 02:07:44,730
Thank you, Fujita.

920
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:18,030
This is an order.

921
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:27,700
You again.

922
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:34,940
I have one more favor to ask of you.

923
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:38,210
Bury me...

924
02:09:39,350 --> 02:09:41,340
so that no one will find me.

925
02:09:55,930 --> 02:09:56,920
<i>Taro...</i>

926
02:09:57,370 --> 02:09:58,800
<i>I will be home soon.</i>

927
02:10:00,070 --> 02:10:02,060
<i>I'm glad to be going back to Japan...</i>

928
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:06,440
<i>but I'm a bit sad
to leave my friends behind.</i>

929
02:10:09,910 --> 02:10:11,470
<i>I drove home...</i>

930
02:10:12,620 --> 02:10:13,610
<i>but...</i>

931
02:10:14,050 --> 02:10:16,650
<i>it's lonely driving all by myself.</i>

932
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:31,090
Is this still Japanese soil?

933
02:10:40,610 --> 02:10:42,340
This is still Japan.

934
02:14:03,190 --> 02:14:04,560
Be careful.
