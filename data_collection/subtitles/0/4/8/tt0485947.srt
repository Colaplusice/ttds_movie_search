1
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:19,298
Like most living creatures,

2
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:23,217
pigeon quickly associate
to press the buton.

3
00:02:24,553 --> 00:02:27,991
But when, the time recycles automatically
every 20 seconds,

4
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:33,254
the pigeon wonders:
Why did I deserve this?

5
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:37,160
And starts to move his wings,

6
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,293
continue to see esential
influences what happens.

7
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:47,234
We call this:
"Pigeon's superstition''

8
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,900
MR. NOBODY

9
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:02,586
Why did I deserve this?

10
00:04:12,694 --> 00:04:16,425
How you been since
last time?

11
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:25,539
- Do I know you?
- We see each other every week.

12
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,172
I am Dr. Flite.

13
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:33,669
- And who are you?
- Nobody. Nemo Nobody.

14
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:38,778
It's an unusual name, right?

15
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,814
Sometimes people call me Mr. Craft

16
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:51,794
Craft cant remember
not a damn thing.

17
00:04:57,238 --> 00:05:01,675
What was the first question
I asked you.

18
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:05,835
- I dont know.
- Can you tell me how old you are?

19
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:13,216
I am 34
I was born in 1975.

20
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:17,816
Would you mind looking at your hands?

21
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,919
You dont have to, if you want.

22
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:25,997
There's a mirror in front of you

23
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:36,132
What year is this?
2009

24
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:39,374
I am 34

25
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:45,080
I was born in february 1975

26
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,081
So I guess it should be
your birthday

27
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:57,461
The last mortal turns <i> 118 </ i>

28
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:07,365
I am 34.

29
00:06:08,877 --> 00:06:14,213
I want to wake up
I'm sick of waking up!

30
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,497
Dont Nemo, it hurts my eyes.

31
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:27,049
Hey friend

32
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,853
Good morning my little angels

33
00:07:31,893 --> 00:07:34,225
Time to school

34
00:07:36,731 --> 00:07:40,132
Children will go to school

35
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,680
Paul, be calm
- My name is not Paul

36
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,657
Paul?

37
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:17,205
Papi? Dady... dady...

38
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:20,875
Paul dont wake your father

39
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:26,742
- Elis
- It's me, Jean

40
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:31,579
Am I dead?
- Go go

41
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,523
Who is Elis?
- Dont know anyone by that name

42
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,618
Esras tired I must rest.

43
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:43,927
I'll go in.

44
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:47,229
The sun hurts my eyes.
- What?

45
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:50,533
The sun hurts my eyes.

46
00:09:09,123 --> 00:09:12,115
This is Gigin Marshall,
live from hospital.

47
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,824
Where we see the last episode
of our series, "'The last mortal''

48
00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:22,234
Mr. Nobody has 117 years
and has nothing.

49
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:28,209
You dont have these adorable
compatible pigs.

50
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:34,842
Live on the chain,
will last human dies

51
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:38,374
natural old-age.

52
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:03,243
Now doctor, is not found
records of identity.

53
00:10:03,277 --> 00:10:06,337
Nothing about his past.

54
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:10,647
We do not know who is Mr. Nobody
No

55
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:14,985
memories remain unclear,
is not abnormal for their age

56
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:19,517
His old memories come
in great detail

57
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,089
let's try something new

58
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:26,362
I think of an old technique

59
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:28,494
No promises

60
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:31,767
Maybe memories
matrices become

61
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:34,104
Maybe nothing happens

62
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:37,542
Be willing to try?

63
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:47,043
This relaxed

64
00:10:48,556 --> 00:10:54,188
Just listen to my voice
her eyelids grow heavy

65
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:59,629
His arms and legs
grow heavy

66
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:03,596
I'll count to three

67
00:11:03,638 --> 00:11:07,335
When I say three

68
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:10,906
Be asleep

69
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:13,436
One

70
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:16,080
two

71
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:22,785
Remember the day I came here

72
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:28,255
Three

73
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:31,263
This sleeping

74
00:12:04,398 --> 00:12:06,958
Remember the back

75
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:09,765
when you say three

76
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:15,208
One, two three

77
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:19,608
Remember

78
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:28,521
I can not remember much
before my birthday

79
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:37,958
And even were not born

80
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:47,164
When not born yet
know everything, everything will happen

81
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:19,137
When you get time
angels of the living

82
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:23,303
They put a finger in your mouth

83
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,074
That on this

84
00:13:26,113 --> 00:13:29,708
Means you have forgotten everything

85
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:33,943
But forget my angel

86
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:45,863
Then you have to find
Mommy and Daddy is not easy to choose

87
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:49,835
Blond and blue ojoz
is all what I ordered

88
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:53,066
It would be nice to not be alone

89
00:13:53,808 --> 00:13:58,438
It is normal for babies to choose
for women at least

90
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:01,971
And not finished yet, dear.

91
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:05,508
Not that we do not want a child

92
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:09,949
Is an important experience

93
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:14,089
I think it would help my husband
if we have a child

94
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:16,619
No george?

95
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:38,612
ultimately chose them?
because the woman smells good

96
00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:41,679
and the man said
I can tell you how we met

97
00:14:42,857 --> 00:14:46,816
It was fate
Give heard butterfly effect?

98
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:46,717
Once upon a time there was a
Mommy and Daddy

99
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:51,224
then they found a
cute baby

100
00:15:51,258 --> 00:15:55,661
And they called Bebito
the baby came out of there

101
00:15:55,696 --> 00:15:58,790
born this day
and no other

102
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,826
Daddy is the day
and Mommy, 7

103
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,135
Everything exists

104
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:11,042
We could see
I could see mom's eyes

105
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:13,478
but could not see my eyes

106
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:18,577
the baby could see his hands
But there was himself

107
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:21,816
so really there?

108
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:25,155
I really exist?

109
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:45,772
My mother taught me
choose the best

110
00:16:45,813 --> 00:16:48,907
and here these

111
00:16:55,156 --> 00:17:00,651
the mom brushed her hair
and lipstick

112
00:17:00,694 --> 00:17:05,028
It smelled good, had his watch Daddy
put it in your arm

113
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,523
The clock to Tik Tok

114
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,164
if the baby fell
mother applauded

115
00:17:12,206 --> 00:17:15,471
bravo said

116
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,711
Why me? and not another?

117
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:45,937
and we will have clear skies
throughout the weekend

118
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,119
Hello.

119
00:18:03,257 --> 00:18:07,694
Why could not remember the past
but not the future?

120
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:12,222
When I preguntba Mommy
I said, stop asking why?

121
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:14,359
It's complicated

122
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,987
Okay, I'm a journalist

123
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:41,787
interviews allowed us
I just wanted to make a spreguntas

124
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:47,227
A friend works here
helped me get

125
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:51,096
What time is it?

126
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:53,368
14 and 12

127
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:59,105
Where can I get that?
- I give the University Museum

128
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,148
Even works

129
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:05,276
I have nothing to tell you

130
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,446
I am Mr. Nobody

131
00:19:07,488 --> 00:19:10,286
a man who never existed

132
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:14,090
Remember how the world was
before crossing the immortality?

133
00:19:14,128 --> 00:19:17,029
What?
- What happened

134
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:24,061
How it was when humans
were mortal?

135
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:28,974
There were cars and pollution

136
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:33,378
Smoked cigarettes
we ate lunch

137
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:38,576
We did everything we could
in this wonderful

138
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,620
Most of the time
nothing happened

139
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,492
As a French film

140
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:55,195
And sex? before
sex was obsolete?

141
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:02,407
Everyone always
was pulling

142
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:12,113
We fell in love

143
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:21,022
What time is it?

144
00:20:22,196 --> 00:20:25,791
How was before the big bang?

145
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,291
There was before because before
from this

146
00:20:29,336 --> 00:20:32,134
TIMP never existed

147
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:35,403
time is the result of
expansion of the universe itself

148
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:39,037
but what about when the Universe
stops expanding?

149
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:42,242
and the movement is back
what will be the natural time?

150
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,012
If string theory and correct

151
00:20:45,052 --> 00:20:47,919
the universe posse
9-dimensional space

152
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,583
And a temporary dimension

153
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,219
We can imagine that in the beginning
all the universes were mixed

154
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:57,628
there during the big bang
3 spaces universes

155
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,164
what we know as high, down
and death

156
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,226
and a temporal dimension
time is

157
00:21:03,904 --> 00:21:07,135
The other six remained together

158
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,175
And if we live in a universe
of bound

159
00:21:11,211 --> 00:21:15,272
how to distinguish between

160
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,306
Illusion and reality?

161
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:21,185
Time as we know it is a
universe in which we experience

162
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:23,382
only in one direction

163
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:26,984
but if the universe
not space

164
00:21:27,027 --> 00:21:29,018
but temporarily

165
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:32,726
If you mix the mashed ppa
and tomato

166
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:36,167
Really it's forever.

167
00:21:36,737 --> 00:21:41,037
cigar smoke out of Dad
but never re-enter

168
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,945
We can not return

169
00:21:49,983 --> 00:21:52,281
that is why it is difficult

170
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,881
You have to make the right choice

171
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:05,558
While not choose
anything is a possibility

172
00:22:15,175 --> 00:22:17,370
Hello Nemo
- Hi Anna

173
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:19,605
Hello Nemo
- Hi Elis

174
00:22:19,646 --> 00:22:22,740
Hello Nemo
- Hi Jean

175
00:22:38,265 --> 00:22:40,563
We are joining this day
And Jean Lymo

176
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:47,230
The pronounced husband and wife

177
00:27:07,634 --> 00:27:11,126
Anna is well
we

178
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:38,930
Then Daddy and Mommy
fought all day

179
00:28:01,455 --> 00:28:04,583
Nemo And you decided?

180
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:09,959
want to come with me or
want to keep your father?

181
00:29:19,332 --> 00:29:21,493
nemo!

182
00:30:30,003 --> 00:30:32,972
Sorry, I do not understand

183
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:36,737
stayed with his father
or was it his mother?

184
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:50,319
Daddy, is it my fault?
- Of course not

185
00:30:50,857 --> 00:30:52,950
That's my fault.

186
00:31:09,276 --> 00:31:11,642
It is a very good deal

187
00:31:30,063 --> 00:31:32,156
Remember

188
00:31:46,746 --> 00:31:50,079
Recalls

189
00:31:52,552 --> 00:31:55,112
Nemo

190
00:31:59,392 --> 00:32:01,656
It is time to wake up honey

191
00:32:16,443 --> 00:32:19,435
It's getting late for school

192
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,850
Nemo, it's me

193
00:32:37,697 --> 00:32:40,165
I hope you have made
your homework

194
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,430
Hurry up and finish

195
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:46,963
Invite someone to dinner
tell you to stop your mouth!

196
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:56,680
How about estubo?
- Good

197
00:32:56,716 --> 00:33:00,345
You've seen good departments?
- E seen a couple

198
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:04,421
Lymo not good
you see people like

199
00:33:04,457 --> 00:33:09,121
Okay, no problem.
- He has the gift of making you feel uncomfortable

200
00:33:09,162 --> 00:33:10,857
It's nothing

201
00:33:11,464 --> 00:33:14,865
What PAOS on Saturday?

202
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:18,098
was behind his car

203
00:33:18,138 --> 00:33:21,164
was whispering

204
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:26,303
He saw nothing

205
00:33:26,346 --> 00:33:30,214
and suddenly the train came
the left

206
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,344
And he was going to crash

207
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:44,090
You're not funny

208
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,099
Lymo think you can predict
the future

209
00:33:48,168 --> 00:33:51,399
I can
- No one can predict

210
00:33:51,438 --> 00:33:54,168
No one know what will happen
- Yo si

211
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:58,437
Well if you could know that
going to get that

212
00:33:59,045 --> 00:34:02,037
I knew you'd say that

213
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:14,051
Are you proud?

214
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:20,498
Why ruin systematically
all I

215
00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:23,229
Do not think I have the right
to live well?

216
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,614
You could stay with your father
if you wanted

217
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:48,151
All I would like to present please
a new student

218
00:34:48,194 --> 00:34:51,186
Her name is Anna
sit porfavo

219
00:34:51,731 --> 00:34:54,928
Well, turn the page 250

220
00:35:24,264 --> 00:35:26,630
You're going to swim?

221
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:30,032
We ..
- No

222
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,435
Come swim with my friends

223
00:35:34,474 --> 00:35:38,638
Do not swim with idiots

224
00:35:42,582 --> 00:35:44,914
Imbecile

225
00:35:53,326 --> 00:35:58,127
What the hell did I say
not swim with idiots?

226
00:36:10,843 --> 00:36:13,937
Anna
- Lyme

227
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,073
If

228
00:36:16,115 --> 00:36:19,949
How have you been?
- I'm fine

229
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:25,022
Yeah, well
- Are your kids?

230
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:28,450
If

231
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,827
Well, we

232
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:41,171
See

233
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:56,385
What the hell did I say
not swim with idiots?''

234
00:37:23,249 --> 00:37:25,877
You're going to swim?

235
00:37:25,918 --> 00:37:28,216
Not

236
00:37:32,892 --> 00:37:36,658
I can not swim
- Sorry

237
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,829
I can not swim

238
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:42,901
It's all

239
00:37:42,935 --> 00:37:45,870
Please do not tell anyone

240
00:37:47,073 --> 00:37:52,568
You're going to swim?
- No, I will stay here

241
00:37:54,247 --> 00:37:56,010
Ok

242
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,507
Love

243
00:38:25,545 --> 00:38:29,845
I want to introduce someone
Harry

244
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:34,409
And this is his daughter Anna
he is Lyme

245
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:48,799
Why do not you shake hands?

246
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:29,408
I can not believe

247
00:39:29,442 --> 00:39:32,070
see how old they are

248
00:39:35,214 --> 00:39:38,706
Sleep together?
- No

249
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:44,451
I will not end
a brother

250
00:39:45,124 --> 00:39:48,924
I'd rather die
- Is your mom?

251
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:51,663
I have no idea

252
00:39:52,732 --> 00:39:57,431
usually drink coffee in the morning

253
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,078
sometimes I can see the future

254
00:40:07,346 --> 00:40:11,112
It seems that it will not happen
anything fun

255
00:40:31,704 --> 00:40:34,366
Still here

256
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:39,910
The day I left

257
00:40:39,946 --> 00:40:43,404
sometimes do not sleep

258
00:40:44,517 --> 00:40:47,111
I ue asiq

259
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:53,080
I believe in what was

260
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:56,492
is all I have left

261
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:06,069
what she sees when she sees me? an old
you never answer your questions?

262
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,075
that mixes everything?

263
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:14,944
taking or dealing
milk?

264
00:41:16,816 --> 00:41:19,979
That is not me

265
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,687
I

266
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:36,933
I have 9 years
running faster than the train

267
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:43,970
I do not feel more.

268
00:41:45,578 --> 00:41:52,984
I have 15

269
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,818
And I'm in love

270
00:41:58,424 --> 00:42:00,654
I'm in love

271
00:43:20,373 --> 00:43:22,398
Lymo?

272
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,546
No sleeping in the studio?

273
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:39,114
No, I just saw and not there

274
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:42,594
Anna has seen your brother?
- It is not my brother

275
00:43:52,772 --> 00:43:54,865
That these

276
00:44:18,664 --> 00:44:21,462
Who is it?
- It's me

277
00:44:22,968 --> 00:44:25,027
It's me, Dad

278
00:44:26,472 --> 00:44:28,440
Your child

279
00:44:28,474 --> 00:44:30,169
Claro, son

280
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:33,736
Where were you?
- In the shop.

281
00:44:34,246 --> 00:44:36,612
know that work there
after school

282
00:44:36,649 --> 00:44:40,016
A boy your age
should get out more

283
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:43,783
Please leave me alone, you know
I can only

284
00:44:43,823 --> 00:44:45,791
It is no problem dad

285
00:44:45,825 --> 00:44:48,020
I like being at home

286
00:45:15,621 --> 00:45:18,351
There was a letter from your mother

287
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:22,224
I know.
I will read it then

288
00:45:22,862 --> 00:45:25,888
Do not want to see her one day?

289
00:45:25,965 --> 00:45:28,798
E not seen in seven years

290
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:32,031
if she wants to see me
know where to find me

291
00:45:35,074 --> 00:45:37,372
I have everything I need

292
00:45:37,409 --> 00:45:39,468
All is well

293
00:46:12,011 --> 00:46:14,912
After three months,

294
00:46:14,947 --> 00:46:17,108
and six days of travel

295
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:26,614
was going
directly to cancer

296
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:32,720
between Mars and Uranus

297
00:46:32,765 --> 00:46:35,359
and five moons

298
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,883
Colonies had more

299
00:47:02,294 --> 00:47:08,164
onboard computer
was evaluating all

300
00:47:25,117 --> 00:47:27,085
Grace

301
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,948
We're leaving, Lymo?

302
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,246
Excuse me?
- Shall we go?

303
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:35,844
How did you know my name?
- We go to the same school

304
00:49:37,983 --> 00:49:40,645
You never notice me

305
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,490
Have a girlfriend?

306
00:49:51,063 --> 00:49:54,055
You're queer, or why not
have a girlfriend?

307
00:49:54,099 --> 00:49:56,260
No

308
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,133
I do not want a

309
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:03,234
Tell me about you

310
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,405
Say something, we

311
00:50:12,751 --> 00:50:16,448
The gravity on Mars is 0.38

312
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:21,954
is three times less
on earth

313
00:50:22,961 --> 00:50:28,058
the ground is covered
waste and dust

314
00:50:34,706 --> 00:50:36,640
You're amazing

315
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:42,308
Raise your hand and say I swear
- Why?

316
00:50:42,347 --> 00:50:46,784
Promise me that if I die
my ashes will pull on Mars

317
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:51,287
Then there would vaiajar
months

318
00:50:51,323 --> 00:50:52,722
Say you swear

319
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,820
I swear

320
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,291
We were neighbors of small

321
00:51:08,841 --> 00:51:10,900
Do not you remember? Elis

322
00:51:13,479 --> 00:51:15,947
In the end

323
00:51:16,014 --> 00:51:18,676
I remember you

324
00:51:30,195 --> 00:51:34,655
I do not know and I am not
a good person

325
00:51:35,367 --> 00:51:37,733
Why do you say that?

326
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,258
Elis to wait!
- I'll call you

327
00:52:01,293 --> 00:52:03,261
You do not know my number

328
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:08,490
What happens when we fall in love?

329
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:12,603
As a result of certain
stimuli

330
00:52:12,638 --> 00:52:15,766
released several charges
endorphin

331
00:52:16,642 --> 00:52:20,169
but why exactly that
woman or man

332
00:52:20,212 --> 00:52:25,081
pheromone is released
corresponding

333
00:52:26,218 --> 00:52:29,517
there are no physical or
one recognizes

334
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:35,452
mother's eyes
an odor that stimulates a nice souvenir

335
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:39,995
is love
part of a plan?

336
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:43,729
a plan for reproduction

337
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:47,933
Bacteria and viruses are organisms
asexual

338
00:52:48,006 --> 00:52:51,772
with each cell division
they mutate

339
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:54,108
and reproduce more
faster than us

340
00:52:54,146 --> 00:52:57,547
against this we respond with
the most powerful weapons

341
00:52:58,216 --> 00:52:59,740
sex

342
00:52:59,785 --> 00:53:03,516
mixing two individuals
their genes

343
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:07,889
And creating an individual
resisting the best virus

344
00:53:07,926 --> 00:53:11,225
the more similar is

345
00:53:11,263 --> 00:53:14,232
participating agencies are
between a war between

346
00:53:14,266 --> 00:53:17,497
2 play modes?

347
00:53:20,305 --> 00:53:23,331
All is all for today.

348
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,540
Hi sweetie
- Arrive too late

349
00:53:29,615 --> 00:53:31,879
Okay

350
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,715
I love you
- I love you more

351
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,744
- I most
- I most

352
00:53:36,788 --> 00:53:38,915
Okay
- Cheating

353
00:53:40,025 --> 00:53:41,993
Well, see ya later

354
00:54:39,217 --> 00:54:41,947
I always liked fish

355
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,683
and thought that someday
also like

356
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:50,825
This relaxed

357
00:54:50,862 --> 00:54:54,628
your eyelids are heavy

358
00:54:55,167 --> 00:55:00,469
Remember

359
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:07,776
Remember

360
00:56:12,377 --> 00:56:16,871
Already back in an hour

361
00:56:20,385 --> 00:56:24,116
Anna, cover
going to burn

362
00:57:39,464 --> 00:57:42,058
I wish

363
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,398
We also wish

364
00:57:46,071 --> 00:57:48,972
Forever.

365
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,733
Forever.

366
00:57:52,277 --> 00:57:54,541
Whatever happens

367
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:57,480
There is no life without you

368
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:59,710
No life without you

369
00:58:21,806 --> 00:58:24,707
You look like my son

370
00:58:24,743 --> 00:58:27,337
I am your son, Dad

371
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:30,507
My son is taller than your

372
00:59:47,692 --> 00:59:50,217
Someone entered

373
00:59:50,762 --> 00:59:54,254
if you could go
move my fingers

374
00:59:55,233 --> 00:59:57,531
Or my eyes

375
00:59:59,437 --> 01:00:01,371
Think you could listen?

376
01:00:05,243 --> 01:00:07,370
Who are you?

377
01:00:07,412 --> 01:00:08,538
What am I doing here?

378
01:00:10,682 --> 01:00:13,014
Move your fingers
. I have to leave here

379
01:00:13,051 --> 01:00:15,645
Back before
accident

380
01:00:44,716 --> 01:00:46,809
I believe in one thing.

381
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:52,380
I think as you say
you love the people we love

382
01:01:00,598 --> 01:01:02,566
I love you

383
01:01:10,775 --> 01:01:13,539
We should not

384
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,339
Perdi

385
01:01:17,248 --> 01:01:19,716
Why?
- You saw him at the party

386
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,553
He does not love me

387
01:01:26,157 --> 01:01:29,183
Y?
- I love him like

388
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,661
I can not help

389
01:01:31,696 --> 01:01:33,789
I'm in love with him

390
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,427
Sorry

391
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,480
I'm getting married Dad

392
01:01:51,516 --> 01:01:55,748
And who is the lucky?
- Not that

393
01:01:56,354 --> 01:01:59,619
I will marry the first
girl to dance with me tonight

394
01:02:35,994 --> 01:02:37,052
Hello

395
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:24,235
On that day, make a decision

396
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:28,780
One, never leave anything
again

397
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:29,781
Two, I'd marry the girl
my bike

398
01:03:29,781 --> 01:03:33,877
Three, I would be rich

399
01:03:33,918 --> 01:03:37,183
four, we would have a house
a big one!

400
01:03:37,222 --> 01:03:39,588
Painted yellow
with a garden

401
01:03:39,624 --> 01:03:42,320
and two children, and Michael Bow

402
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,124
five, would have a convertible
one red

403
01:03:45,163 --> 01:03:47,290
And a swimming pool

404
01:03:47,332 --> 01:03:51,291
six, I will not stop until
succeed

405
01:04:09,153 --> 01:04:10,677
Papi?

406
01:04:20,298 --> 01:04:22,732
Do not wake your father

407
01:04:24,168 --> 01:04:26,568
I, Jean

408
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,104
Who is Alice?

409
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:36,106
Do not know anyone named

410
01:04:36,147 --> 01:04:38,547
Replay

411
01:04:40,518 --> 01:04:44,045
Lymo you care?

412
01:04:46,224 --> 01:04:51,184
I ask you a question

413
01:04:51,229 --> 01:04:54,562
You did it on purpose?

414
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,027
I found this on the nightstand

415
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:03,972
Moments in life come
where everything seems blurry

416
01:05:04,008 --> 01:05:07,034
elections have been taken

417
01:05:07,078 --> 01:05:09,103
I can only continue

418
01:05:09,147 --> 01:05:12,116
I know like the back
of my hand

419
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:15,981
I can predict any reaction

420
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:19,183
my life is a bit confused

421
01:05:19,757 --> 01:05:24,126
E done everything to reach this
point and now I'm here

422
01:05:24,162 --> 01:05:26,892
I'm fucking bored

423
01:05:28,866 --> 01:05:32,927
The hardest thing is knowing
I'm still alive

424
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:41,976
It's my handwriting

425
01:05:42,547 --> 01:05:45,277
But I do not remember

426
01:06:01,299 --> 01:06:03,392
Jean?

427
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:08,598
What did you say?

428
01:06:11,209 --> 01:06:13,837
A strange dream

429
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:36,095
It is important to understand
in life, things

430
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:40,970
not always
as planned

431
01:06:41,506 --> 01:06:45,340
Harry and I think

432
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:48,436
that life is not always what
thought it would be

433
01:06:48,479 --> 01:06:50,447
Are you talking about?

434
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,850
I do not understand

435
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:56,353
Well, you know

436
01:06:58,423 --> 01:07:01,119
Harry and I are going to separate

437
01:07:04,796 --> 01:07:07,026
Why?

438
01:07:07,698 --> 01:07:11,190
They have no right!
- Please, you did your part!

439
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:15,433
Not that passes between two units
but I do not know, is sick!

440
01:07:15,506 --> 01:07:20,569
You are brothers, skies
- We are not brothers!

441
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,443
I knew

442
01:07:29,487 --> 01:07:32,888
And do not tell me

443
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:41,425
A d (onde you go?

444
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:48,701
In ten days

445
01:07:50,141 --> 01:07:53,201
My father wants us to go

446
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:05,088
Wait

447
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:07,647
every Sunday, ok?

448
01:08:08,693 --> 01:08:11,685
Until we meet again
lifelong

449
01:08:25,743 --> 01:08:29,406
You are the first and last person
and loved it

450
01:08:30,882 --> 01:08:33,077
Ten days

451
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:41,414
That makes 14.2 thousand minutes

452
01:08:44,862 --> 01:08:47,797
I wish that everything now detubiera

453
01:08:49,467 --> 01:08:52,527
we stay like this forever

454
01:08:54,639 --> 01:08:58,541
I feel the slow breathing

455
01:08:58,576 --> 01:09:01,101
time goes slow

456
01:09:02,146 --> 01:09:05,081
and goes well

457
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:47,680
I remember your smell
each part of your body

458
01:10:16,387 --> 01:10:18,651
Time to go

459
01:10:27,465 --> 01:10:30,400
I love you

460
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:13,802
Anna!

461
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:49,842
Anna

462
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,678
You hear me?

463
01:12:12,737 --> 01:12:15,001
You should see the future

464
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:19,066
It will be good for a new home
have a new life

465
01:12:19,677 --> 01:12:24,137
We will pool
- You hate the water, not even swim

466
01:12:24,815 --> 01:12:27,841
Do not know what you want
- I do not want it

467
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:30,115
So tell me what's that?

468
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:35,491
I do not want to be like you

469
01:12:36,594 --> 01:12:39,290
You know nothing of my

470
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:42,356
I always liked psiscinas

471
01:12:43,434 --> 01:12:46,096
When I get old I want a swimming pool

472
01:13:25,409 --> 01:13:29,675
Anna

473
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:34,781
I feel that I see on every corner

474
01:13:55,539 --> 01:14:00,738
Sometimes I wonder
maybe you live in the same time I

475
01:14:00,778 --> 01:14:03,440
And do not know.

476
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,745
Maybe you're here
close

477
01:14:06,784 --> 01:14:10,686
Lymo, hear my voice?

478
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:14,086
Anna

479
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:19,925
After 90 days, the computer
still keeping the system

480
01:14:19,964 --> 01:14:23,297
the appropriate level

481
01:14:48,092 --> 01:14:51,459
I was always fascinated by the fact
many frogs could pass

482
01:14:51,495 --> 01:14:54,828
completely frozen winter
and when it was the spring

483
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:59,529
thawed and re-lived
and point

484
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:05,975
said computer
to hibernation

485
01:15:19,323 --> 01:15:21,951
Welcome to Mars

486
01:15:21,992 --> 01:15:26,122
I hope you have rested and
an awakening refrescamnte

487
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:33,398
And wait for the landing

488
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:42,310
will go to the first excursion
red planet

489
01:15:45,516 --> 01:15:48,781
Probably the worst thing
to be on Mars

490
01:15:48,819 --> 01:15:51,515
is that nothing happened there

491
01:15:51,555 --> 01:15:54,285
time seemed won and empty

492
01:15:54,792 --> 01:15:58,751
It seems that there was much to do
I hope there's something

493
01:16:26,056 --> 01:16:28,149
I get the time.

494
01:16:28,192 --> 01:16:31,127
It is time of day

495
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:34,222
The sun came out

496
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:44,937
it is different
of this morning

497
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:49,273
Not the same perfume.

498
01:16:51,181 --> 01:16:53,513
his hands are soft

499
01:16:58,455 --> 01:17:01,083
is Elis?

500
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:06,690
We must not

501
01:17:08,565 --> 01:17:11,398
I love Stefano

502
01:17:12,436 --> 01:17:14,301
Do not say anything

503
01:17:14,371 --> 01:17:16,965
You're the one I love

504
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:20,238
Then count on me to Mars

505
01:17:20,978 --> 01:17:22,912
I promise.

506
01:17:58,649 --> 01:18:00,981
want to walk or something?

507
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:04,619
I want nothing

508
01:18:05,422 --> 01:18:07,447
Nothing

509
01:18:10,727 --> 01:18:13,890
I'm so horrible.
- You're not

510
01:18:13,931 --> 01:18:19,062
I can not stand
- Think

511
01:18:19,103 --> 01:18:22,436
you have the most incredible children
- Do not try to make me feel better

512
01:18:31,615 --> 01:18:34,812
What's wrong with me?

513
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:46,552
How this mom?
- This little tired

514
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:51,291
Always tired
- Yes, always

515
01:18:52,903 --> 01:18:56,964
This depressed?
- It has its ups and downs

516
01:18:57,007 --> 01:19:01,774
Not you, but next time
I'll see someone else

517
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:11,885
And who is this a joke?

518
01:19:11,922 --> 01:19:14,220
some?

519
01:19:14,258 --> 01:19:16,556
Yo si

520
01:19:16,593 --> 01:19:21,860
What is green, small
and goes up and down?

521
01:19:21,899 --> 01:19:25,096
A lemon in the elevator
not funny

522
01:19:28,672 --> 01:19:32,904
You'll be fine?
- Sure, this evil not because she

523
01:19:52,863 --> 01:19:54,990
I can not stand it

524
01:19:55,032 --> 01:19:58,297
That noise
- Something I'm going to take him down

525
01:19:59,369 --> 01:20:02,167
s birthday

526
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:07,276
What kind of mother am I?

527
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,810
I have to get up

528
01:20:33,337 --> 01:20:36,431
These partying?
puedod ecirte something '

529
01:20:36,473 --> 01:20:39,806
You have to have a good party

530
01:20:39,843 --> 01:20:42,311
Beautiful lights.

531
01:20:43,146 --> 01:20:45,910
but your friends are not
enough dancing

532
01:20:45,949 --> 01:20:48,679
and your mother must
take care!

533
01:21:45,909 --> 01:21:48,241
It was a good day

534
01:21:50,213 --> 01:21:53,273
The best in a long time

535
01:21:58,755 --> 01:22:00,814
Ready?
- Pope Chao

536
01:22:03,193 --> 01:22:04,888
Have fun.

537
01:25:04,207 --> 01:25:06,835
It is not life without you

538
01:25:16,019 --> 01:25:18,954
I have to get used

539
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:26,156
We talked so much if not
were there, so strange

540
01:25:27,764 --> 01:25:30,699
truly speak

541
01:25:46,416 --> 01:25:48,976
I need time

542
01:25:50,921 --> 01:25:53,685
when we were separated at 15

543
01:25:53,723 --> 01:25:56,283
I said I would never love anyone else

544
01:25:57,661 --> 01:26:01,927
and never would be in contact
I could never throw out anyone

545
01:26:02,666 --> 01:26:05,999
And not done anything alone

546
01:26:07,938 --> 01:26:12,307
I decided that I'm alive prentendera

547
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:19,572
and this is where i was expecting

548
01:26:19,616 --> 01:26:22,176
all this time

549
01:26:23,253 --> 01:26:27,781
likely to see lives
but alone

550
01:26:28,925 --> 01:26:31,120
with you

551
01:26:39,836 --> 01:26:42,634
But I'm not used

552
01:26:42,672 --> 01:26:46,073
you know
love

553
01:26:50,347 --> 01:26:55,444
I'm afraid to lose you again
afraid to be without you again

554
01:26:57,454 --> 01:26:59,945
I am so terrified

555
01:27:04,227 --> 01:27:06,559
We need to take time

556
01:27:07,097 --> 01:27:09,429
I see you again

557
01:27:16,806 --> 01:27:19,366
Call me at this number

558
01:27:21,678 --> 01:27:24,078
in two days

559
01:27:26,583 --> 01:27:29,746
I'll wait in the cas Ablank reagent

560
01:28:09,959 --> 01:28:14,419
You know why I lost Anna?

561
01:28:14,464 --> 01:28:18,230
because two months before

562
01:28:18,268 --> 01:28:22,261
was warming an egg

563
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:31,140
he created something in the room

564
01:28:31,181 --> 01:28:34,150
are as different temperatures

565
01:28:35,752 --> 01:28:40,587
and a shower two months after
other side of the world

566
01:28:41,458 --> 01:28:47,226
the Brazilian did not put out his egg
I was boiling

567
01:28:47,263 --> 01:28:50,232
had lost his job
factory

568
01:28:50,266 --> 01:28:54,259
For six months before
boot jeans prices

569
01:28:54,304 --> 01:28:59,207
As the Chinese proverb says

570
01:28:59,242 --> 01:29:02,643
A single ball of snow
can clean the bamboo

571
01:29:02,679 --> 01:29:06,638
Jeans production
occurs in other countries

572
01:29:14,124 --> 01:29:17,423
I lost all trace of Anna

573
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:23,191
Wait for it

574
01:29:23,233 --> 01:29:25,224
every day

575
01:30:51,387 --> 01:30:53,184
Anna

576
01:30:56,926 --> 01:30:59,258
Lymo

577
01:31:14,577 --> 01:31:17,842
I'm
I'm

578
01:31:44,574 --> 01:31:46,872
Everything will be fine

579
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,780
I had to make this dream

580
01:32:00,823 --> 01:32:05,385
of a prehistoric time
I could hear the screams

581
01:32:14,804 --> 01:32:17,238
the bear trap

582
01:32:17,273 --> 01:32:20,071
and no longer listened to more by the

583
01:32:23,046 --> 01:32:25,537
when I wake up

584
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:28,277
No Bear

585
01:32:28,318 --> 01:32:30,786
but still I have fear

586
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:33,653
I'm not a bear hunter

587
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:38,491
I am an employer of machinery
Copiers

588
01:32:43,366 --> 01:32:44,890
I do not live

589
01:32:45,468 --> 01:32:48,596
What you do is a disaster

590
01:32:49,739 --> 01:32:53,607
I would love away
the bear

591
01:32:53,643 --> 01:32:56,305
and thus would have no more fear

592
01:32:59,615 --> 01:33:03,244
what feeds our fears'

593
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:07,052
when we have birds in the hatchery

594
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:11,823
and put a goose
Simulated flying

595
01:33:11,861 --> 01:33:14,830
newborns
stretch their necks

596
01:33:14,864 --> 01:33:18,197
but if we reverse the direction

597
01:33:18,234 --> 01:33:23,228
changes the focus
the response is immediate babies

598
01:33:23,306 --> 01:33:27,072
put fear

599
01:33:27,110 --> 01:33:30,671
no education

600
01:33:30,713 --> 01:33:33,944
and no fear
to sopervivencia

601
01:33:34,017 --> 01:33:38,920
but in humans
when in danger

602
01:33:38,955 --> 01:33:42,356
the body responds

603
01:34:02,278 --> 01:34:06,237
Turn around Nemo

604
01:35:04,674 --> 01:35:09,873
Recalls

605
01:36:20,683 --> 01:36:22,150
Honey, it's me

606
01:37:35,758 --> 01:37:38,727
at least he died or not?

607
01:37:38,761 --> 01:37:40,956
I do not understand

608
01:37:40,997 --> 01:37:43,864
She says she has children
and then not

609
01:37:52,775 --> 01:37:54,174
Hi dad

610
01:38:00,082 --> 01:38:02,380
I'm coming in a while

611
01:38:23,973 --> 01:38:28,205
Are you hungry?
- I want nothing

612
01:38:32,481 --> 01:38:34,915
what will you do today?

613
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:38,852
I was thinking of taking the
opportunity to self laavr

614
01:38:43,893 --> 01:38:47,056
do you have with this car?

615
01:38:47,596 --> 01:38:50,156
do you mean?

616
01:38:50,199 --> 01:38:54,863
Why do you care so much that car
when you leave me here alone? v

617
01:38:55,905 --> 01:38:58,465
What is the car?

618
01:39:40,116 --> 01:39:42,584
There will be no more problem
with self

619
01:39:56,399 --> 01:39:58,162
what happens?

620
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:00,293
Why see me like that?

621
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:03,668
Why look at me so?

622
01:40:07,843 --> 01:40:10,073
Nemo

623
01:40:12,581 --> 01:40:16,483
I do not know Nemo
I never see

624
01:40:23,292 --> 01:40:25,783
You're always somewhere else

625
01:41:18,147 --> 01:41:19,637
Mr Jones

626
01:41:20,716 --> 01:41:22,081
If

627
01:41:22,117 --> 01:41:25,280
We have your luggage
follow me

628
01:41:25,321 --> 01:41:27,812
I'll take you to the hotel where
can rest a while

629
01:41:27,857 --> 01:41:30,348
the appointment is at 3pm

630
01:41:51,647 --> 01:41:53,308
Daniel

631
01:41:53,349 --> 01:41:56,580
Daniel Jones

632
01:41:59,555 --> 01:42:03,457
Daniel Jones is his name?

633
01:42:03,959 --> 01:42:06,985
Of course not

634
01:42:27,383 --> 01:42:29,214
This is weird

635
01:42:29,785 --> 01:42:32,379
his shoes are size
different

636
01:42:45,968 --> 01:42:48,630
Not seafood

637
01:42:48,671 --> 01:42:50,798
is wrong
is all

638
01:42:50,839 --> 01:42:53,967
Then grew two inches
cuandio went to work

639
01:43:16,599 --> 01:43:20,399
Did not feel the same way

640
01:43:21,837 --> 01:43:24,362
is a different perfume

641
01:43:25,708 --> 01:43:28,643
Another person

642
01:43:37,152 --> 01:43:39,518
Let's begin again

643
01:43:40,022 --> 01:43:42,752
Think skateboard

644
01:43:42,791 --> 01:43:45,885
left

645
01:43:48,097 --> 01:43:50,793
right hand

646
01:44:50,926 --> 01:44:54,953
What happens?
- I dreamed Stefano

647
01:44:57,433 --> 01:45:00,231
I did not care

648
01:45:06,175 --> 01:45:08,006
I loved

649
01:45:09,445 --> 01:45:12,744
I can not see another explanation
to be well

650
01:45:14,349 --> 01:45:17,216
anything else that might be?

651
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:19,688
I loved

652
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:23,990
I know I'm crazy.

653
01:45:25,394 --> 01:45:28,124
every time I wake up
I open my eyes and see your face

654
01:45:28,163 --> 01:45:30,495
and begin to mourn

655
01:45:33,302 --> 01:45:36,567
I realize that you
my life goes sideways

656
01:45:40,776 --> 01:45:44,576
how can you be so calm?

657
01:45:45,981 --> 01:45:48,108
You're not human
how can you hear that?

658
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:50,675
Do not

659
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:55,816
Not my fault, right?
You're not gonna stop, no?

660
01:45:56,625 --> 01:45:58,786
I can not live without you

661
01:46:00,763 --> 01:46:03,425
I hate them all

662
01:46:03,465 --> 01:46:05,365
I hate you

663
01:46:06,368 --> 01:46:08,199
Children

664
01:46:08,737 --> 01:46:12,434
I can not go
- Is there anything I can do

665
01:46:15,344 --> 01:46:18,245
Let's go swimming

666
01:46:18,313 --> 01:46:26,812
I love you

667
01:46:46,341 --> 01:46:49,572
And leave me

668
01:46:52,214 --> 01:46:54,808
know what they say

669
01:46:55,784 --> 01:46:58,776
everything is at the end

670
01:47:00,122 --> 01:47:02,420
even evil

671
01:47:25,914 --> 01:47:27,541
Hello

672
01:47:37,826 --> 01:47:40,317
Not much at the forefront

673
01:47:52,975 --> 01:47:55,409
How will it be?
$ -9 Please

674
01:47:55,444 --> 01:47:57,412
Here

675
01:48:09,691 --> 01:48:13,024
$ 9 please
- Here

676
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:17,594
Have a good evening

677
01:48:40,489 --> 01:48:43,822
Why smoke cigarrro
never return to smoking?

678
01:48:44,393 --> 01:48:47,385
Molesculas Why separate?

679
01:48:47,429 --> 01:48:50,159
why never sugar
is reform?

680
01:48:50,232 --> 01:48:54,828
Because the universe enters
a state of dissipation

681
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:57,134
is the principle

682
01:48:57,172 --> 01:49:00,198
the tendency of the universe
develop another state

683
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:02,335
in order decresciente

684
01:49:02,411 --> 01:49:04,311
the principle of entropy

685
01:49:04,346 --> 01:49:06,837
is related to
arrow of time

686
01:49:06,882 --> 01:49:09,112
result of the expansion
the universe

687
01:49:09,151 --> 01:49:13,053
gravitational force

688
01:49:14,656 --> 01:49:17,557
or is very weak energy?

689
01:49:17,592 --> 01:49:21,323
at the time the universe
can happen to a contraction phase on (

690
01:49:21,363 --> 01:49:23,627
the big crunch

691
01:49:26,735 --> 01:49:29,465
and in that time again?

692
01:49:32,007 --> 01:49:34,168
everything in reverse?

693
01:49:39,915 --> 01:49:42,247
Nobody knows the answer

694
01:49:57,232 --> 01:50:00,998
Please aprovehce to give
a close look at planet

695
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:17,816
so are these things?

696
01:50:17,853 --> 01:50:22,017
here is cheaper
has become very expensive

697
01:50:35,804 --> 01:50:36,998
Hello

698
01:50:37,039 --> 01:50:39,064

Anna
taste

700
01:50:46,715 --> 01:50:51,015
What brings you to Mars?
- I measure the distance between Mars

701
01:50:51,053 --> 01:50:53,681
and land

702
01:50:53,722 --> 01:50:56,350
time study

703
01:50:56,425 --> 01:51:00,452
everything fails
at a time

704
01:51:02,597 --> 01:51:06,124
Y?
- The crack happened in 1992

705
01:51:08,070 --> 01:51:11,767
could generate some

706
01:51:11,807 --> 01:51:13,707
And you?

707
01:51:13,742 --> 01:51:16,609
I keep a promise

708
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:21,639
alarm alert
meteor shower

709
01:52:43,698 --> 01:52:45,791
When I wake up

I wake up!

712
01:52:51,439 --> 01:52:53,339
The game just

01:52:53,875 --> 01:52:59,677
Are you okay?

714
01:53:00,215 --> 01:53:04,117
When I say three

I know it looks complicated to you
but is simpler than you think

736
01:55:37,505 --> 01:55:41,032
Beware the chair is damaged

737
01:55:46,147 --> 01:55:49,947

is the past

everything that you say I said
a young man myself

747
01:56:23,818 --> 01:56:27,276
I have only to remember
(on the conversation

748
01:56:27,322 --> 01:56:30,951
Everything is written here

749
01:56:30,992 --> 01:56:32,755
Believe

750
01:56:33,762 --> 01:56:38,597
In this life, do not exist

751
01:56:38,633 --> 01:56:40,157
Not because

752
01:56:40,702 --> 01:56:43,933
Maybe someone knows
architect

753
01:56:43,972 --> 01:56:46,497
The architect?

754
01:56:46,541 --> 01:56:51,774
The child, who
wrote when I was afraid

755
01:56:52,414 --> 01:56:56,680
Maybe your parents never
met

756
01:56:59,354 --> 01:57:04,587
Maybe your father died
in an accident

757
01:57:05,860 --> 01:57:10,991
Maybe you did not get to reach
the egg

758
01:57:15,703 --> 01:57:20,197
Maybe you died in a
pre historic man

759
01:57:25,313 --> 01:57:28,111
so it does not work

760
01:57:29,551 --> 01:57:32,111
Do not exist

761
01:57:33,121 --> 01:57:36,989
If the calculations are correct

762
01:57:37,025 --> 01:57:41,394
need permenecer alive
until 2091

763
01:57:43,998 --> 01:57:47,798
and die within 5 to 50 am

764
01:58:14,062 --> 01:58:16,963
Sorry, did not know
it would record more

765
01:58:16,998 --> 01:58:19,330
I have to submit my story
for tomorrow morning

766
01:58:21,002 --> 01:58:24,165
All that said
is contradictory

767
01:58:24,739 --> 01:58:29,039
It can be in one place
and another at the same time

768
01:58:29,077 --> 01:58:33,480
Then we have options

769
01:58:33,515 --> 01:58:38,646
of all those lives, which ...
correct?

770
01:58:38,686 --> 01:58:42,520
Each of these lives.

771
01:58:43,625 --> 01:58:48,892
Each path is correct

772
01:58:51,699 --> 01:58:56,796
Everything could not have
been nothing but

773
01:58:56,838 --> 01:59:01,366
and would have been so
meaning

774
01:59:03,411 --> 01:59:06,539
Tell him hey were aliens

775
01:59:07,181 --> 01:59:10,344
You're too young for that

776
01:59:10,385 --> 01:59:12,876
There may be dead
and stay here

777
01:59:12,921 --> 01:59:15,549
There may not exist

778
01:59:20,795 --> 01:59:23,229
This life after death?

779
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:28,601
After the death

780
01:59:30,538 --> 01:59:35,373
How can you be so sure
you exist?

781
01:59:45,687 --> 01:59:48,918
Do not exist

782
01:59:49,991 --> 01:59:52,152
Neither do I.

783
01:59:54,529 --> 02:00:00,229
We only live in imagination
a 9 year old boy

784
02:00:01,336 --> 02:00:06,433
We imagine a 9 year old boy

785
02:00:06,474 --> 02:00:10,205
unafraid
impossible options

786
02:00:18,553 --> 02:00:20,783
Run! Run!

787
02:00:25,860 --> 02:00:27,919
Nemo!

788
02:00:32,066 --> 02:00:34,091
Run!

789
02:00:40,174 --> 02:00:42,142
Nemo!

790
02:01:06,334 --> 02:01:08,302
You're the one I love

791
02:01:22,784 --> 02:01:26,220
in chess
its called suan

792
02:01:26,854 --> 02:01:30,483
when a single motion

793
02:01:34,195 --> 02:01:37,460
is not to move

794
02:01:46,007 --> 02:01:48,168
Come and see.

795
02:02:10,064 --> 02:02:11,964
It's the same.

796
02:02:11,999 --> 02:02:15,833
The child is depriving,

797
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:19,135
He doesnt need it anymore

798
02:02:19,207 --> 02:02:24,042
before he was unable
to make o choice,

799
02:02:24,078 --> 02:02:27,445
because he didnt want to happen.

800
02:02:27,482 --> 02:02:30,542
Now I knows what was happen.

801
02:02:31,652 --> 02:02:35,349
Is unable to make a choice.

802
02:03:39,554 --> 02:03:41,317
Destiny

803
02:03:48,996 --> 02:03:50,930
here you are.

804
02:04:15,990 --> 02:04:21,223
This is the most beautiful day
of my life.

805
02:04:29,537 --> 02:04:36,067
Anna... Anna...
