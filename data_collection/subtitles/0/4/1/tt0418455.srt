00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,231
ADAM'S APPLES

2
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,154
Adam?
Sorry I'm late.

3
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,751
Ivan Fjeldsted.
Call me lvan.

4
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,556
I'm a bit flustered but I've
been looking forward to meeting you.

5
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,911
Let's get going.

6
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,717
Let me take your bag.
That was... Come on.

7
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,556
People who have been in prison are
often a bit protective of their stuff.

8
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,871
Have you lived
in the country before?

9
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,112
This is our small church.
Just take a look at this.

10
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,030
This is our apple tree.
We're very proud of it.

11
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,268
There are lots of apples this year.
Lots and lots.

12
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,268
It's probably because of
the warm summer.

13
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,391
They're not ripe just yet.
Don't eat that. Come with me.

14
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,198
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

15
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,188
Adam will stay with us.
This is Khalid and Gunnar.

16
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,994
I won't talk to egghead.

17
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,875
There will be lots of time
for that kind of talk.

18
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,036
Come on, Adam.

19
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,277
What does the O stand for?
In Adam O. Pedersen?

20
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,110
What's the story about the O?
Your parents must have told you.

21
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,756
- I forgot to ask.
- That's a good answer.

22
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,191
It says here
that you're a neo-Nazi.

23
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,631
Are you really?

24
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,356
It's not the first thing that springs
to mind by looking at you.

25
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,315
Here it says you're EVIL. It's rude
to write that on a person's CV.

26
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,114
Are you really evil?

27
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,359
I didn't think so.
Tell you what, just forget about this -

28
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,712
- because there are no evil people.
We don't believe in that.

29
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,596
If you only look for evil
then the world is evil.

30
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,193
But you can try to focus on
the silver lining as we do here.

31
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,597
That makes everything easier.

32
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,713
In later years the Devil
has sent his troops to test us -

33
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,718
- but we have conquered them all.

34
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,755
All of us here have
found God in some way.

35
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,748
You just met Khalid and Gunnar.
I saw that you did.

36
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,509
Gunnar was paroled
four years ago.

37
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,508
He was just to stay three months,
but he chose to stay.

38
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,269
Gunnar was
what you would call an alcoholic.

39
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,268
He stole and raped girls
but now he's on the wagon -

40
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:10,716
- and is studying theology. He's not
the only one. There's also Khalid.

41
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,117
He used to rob gas stations.

42
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,235
Do you remember a young man being
shot when he went to buy condoms?

43
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,039
- No.
- Khalid is still not allowed at Statoil.

44
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,634
A few hostage dramas later he's
learning Danish and is doing well.

45
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,229
Tell me what I have to do.

46
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,592
I can't do that. You have
to discover that for yourself.

47
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,793
All I want is for you
to set yourself a goal.

48
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,955
Are you listening to me?

49
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,720
Yes, I believe I am.

50
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,708
In any other situation
I would say that you are rude -

51
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,119
- but let's not talk about that now.
What do you want your goal to be?

52
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,718
I would like to bake a cake.

53
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,436
Bake a cake?
Oh, an apple cake?

54
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,359
Yes, an apple cake.

55
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,680
- My goal is to bake a big apple cake.
- With the apples from our garden?

56
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,715
- Yes, the apples from the garden.
- That's a good idea.

57
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,631
I think we found your goal.
You're going to bake a cake.

58
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,435
You'll look after the tree
until 1 st of August.

59
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,952
Then you'll use them
to bake an apple cake.

60
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,754
I just wanted to give you this. It has
both the old and the new testament.

61
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,430
It's a good thing to have.
Sleep tight.

62
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,275
Evil has many faces -

63
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,917
- and it can be difficult to tell
them apart and choose sides.

64
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,638
Especially these days where so many
things are said in this and that town.

65
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,356
Everything has so many nuances.
Also we humans.

66
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,829
If the game of chess had undergone
the same development as humans -

67
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,398
- the queen would be in front,
the rooks would be crooked -

68
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,717
- and the pawn
would be the main piece.

69
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:37,234
We no longer know
who we are and this rootlessness...

70
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,232
Are we boring you, Poul?
Is the word of God boring to you?

71
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,989
- Are we boring you?
- I need to go to the loo.

72
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,919
- Can't it wait?
- Not really.

73
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,556
We finish in 20 minutes.

74
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,551
- I think that Poul can wait that long.
- Let him go for sake of fuck and crap.

75
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,198
- So we can song sing now.
- Okay, democracy has spoken.

76
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,995
Go, Poul.
Go take a crap.

77
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,116
- But you can't come back in.
- That's okay.

78
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,269
You have to use the hospital loo
because you can't use ours.

79
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,395
- Why not?
- It's locked during the service.

80
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,956
- Why?
- For security reasons.

81
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,515
Let's continue
if it's okay with Poul.

82
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,635
We'll sing 634
"You know my heart".

83
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,559
There's fried pork.

84
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,789
It was a good sermon today.
At least it was shorter than usual.

85
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,276
Too bad for old Poul Nordkap.

86
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,153
Ivan is always on his case.
He leaves during the sermon.

87
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,433
It's not nice of him.
He always does that.

88
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,270
It's because he was in
a concentration camp during the war.

89
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,553
He's become restless in his old age.
He's 86.

90
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,196
It won't be any fun
when that age comes.

91
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,795
Don't worry about lvan.

92
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,552
He's okay. Just don't venture
into an argument with him.

93
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,437
- What the hell are you doing?
- Me?

94
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,275
- My phone!
- I thought you were sleeping.

95
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,917
And my wallet! Are you stealing
my stuff? Have you gone insane?

96
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,999
- I'm sorry.
- Piss off, fatso!

97
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,835
- Sleep tight.
- Piss off!

98
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,796
BOOK OF JOB

99
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,077
- They're not moving.
- They cheeky for sake of fuck!

100
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,431
Fly home bird for sake of fuck!

101
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,279
What are we going to do?

102
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,519
There won't be
any apples left for your cake.

103
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,315
Let the paki monkey climb up
and shoo them away.

104
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,672
- I'm not talking to you.
- I don't know anything about birds.

105
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,599
What do we do
in a case like this?

106
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,958
You leave them alone, I think.

107
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,712
- Can't we let them eat the apples?
- They're Adam's apples for the cake.

108
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,913
- For sake of fuck, he can't bake.
- You don't know that.

109
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,035
If Adam wants to bake us a cake
it's our job to support him.

110
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,312
- He can't bake bread.
- Shut up!

111
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,308
- I can tell.
- What the fuck do you know, paki?

112
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,594
That's the right attitude. That kind
of attitude will get us some cake.

113
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,871
- There's more of them coming.
- That's just plain rude.

114
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,876
That's good.
Very authentic.

115
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,108
- No bird will come back now.
- Reverend Fjeldsted?

116
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,312
Yes?
Call me lvan.

117
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,308
- I'm Sarah Svendsen.
- Hi. This is my assistant Adam.

118
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,719
I'm not from around here. I wanted
to come to the service but I couldn't.

119
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,708
Don't apologise.
You only cheat yourself.

120
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,152
What's this?
You're in a bad way.

121
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,828
Let's go inside and talk.

122
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,675
- I met this guy.
- The milk has gone bad.

123
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,113
- Fine.
- I was thinking about her.

124
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,199
- Me too.
- No, you didn't.

125
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,756
Are you saying I didn't?
Are you?

126
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,159
Let's take that discussion right now.
This may be the right time and place.

127
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,036
John says: "He came to Canaan
after having turned water into wine."

128
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,951
"A boy was sick. Jesus said: Do to
others as you want them to do to you."

129
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,038
Don't call me inconsiderate.

130
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,713
- It's okay. I don't take milk.
- Maybe we have some cookies.

131
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:51,189
Adam, could you go see if there's
a few cookies for Sarah and me?

132
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,639
- Maybe I shouldn't have come.
- Sure. So you met a guy?

133
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,994
I have been in Indonesia working for
the World Wide Fund for Nature.

134
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,035
I made love to a man
and got pregnant.

135
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,038
I used to drink a lot before.

136
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,633
Now I'm in AA
and I've been sober for 341 days.

137
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:29,188
Now they're saying that
the baby may be handicapped.

138
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:35,236
- I don't know where the dad is...
- Just a second, Sarah.

139
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,869
Why do I get three cookies and Sarah
only two? Don't you find that odd?

140
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,310
There were five left.
Hers looked bigger.

141
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,278
I don't think so. Have you measured
the cookies? He never does that.

142
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,472
Let's stop this discussion.

143
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,034
- You would like to get rid of it?
- Yes... No!

144
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,075
There's a 60% chance
that the baby is handicapped.

145
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,276
I have to decide within a week
before it's too late.

146
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,438
I can't handle
a handicapped child.

147
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,632
60 per cent is a lot, right?

148
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,791
It's just statistics.
Let me tell you something.

149
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,109
When we were expecting our son we
were told that he could be disabled.

150
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,189
We could have been intimidated
by statistics and reason -

151
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,871
- but we chose to look
at the bright side, and now...

152
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,916
When I see him run around in the
garden or doing his homework -

153
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,669
- we're happy that
we chose to have him.

154
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,316
You won't find anyone
to say otherwise.

155
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,878
The Devil is testing us all the time.
We have to make the right choices.

156
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,553
If we all listened to reason the
world would be a gloomy place to live.

157
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,833
You need to follow you heart
and have the baby.

158
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,229
- Fuck!
- Good morning.

159
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,476
Fuck, that hurt!

160
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,708
Why the hell haven't
you turned the cooker off?

161
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,399
This looks bad.

162
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,956
What did reverend Fjeldsted say?

163
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,197
He's a frigging idiot.

164
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,155
He may be weird,
but he's a good boy.

165
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,390
His life sure as shit hasn't been easy.
Everything went wrong from the start.

166
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,910
His mother died
giving birth to him.

167
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:26,231
He lived with his father and sister.

168
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,560
- Until they took him away.
- Ivan? They took lvan away?

169
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,073
No, nobody took lvan away.
The father was taken away. Henning.

170
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,191
Why?

171
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:46,397
He was fucking those kids black
and blue. They could hardly walk.

172
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,277
- Shut up and fix this.
- Pardon my forthrightness.

173
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,634
I've learned
it's best to tell it like it is.

174
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,310
You're best served
by being told the truth.

175
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,276
What's this I hear?
The cooker bit you?

176
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,474
- Gunnar forgot to turn it of.
- Take a seat. I'd like to talk to you.

177
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,629
Do you know why
all this is happening?

178
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,355
Why are all these birds in the tree?

179
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,758
And the cooker. Why did you
burn yourself all of the sudden?

180
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,595
I think someone is trying to tell you
that you shouldn't go near the cooker.

181
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,872
You can't bake
a cake without a cooker.

182
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,516
I think Satan is testing us.

183
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,838
By not letting me bake the cake?

184
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:59,149
He's trying to fight us. He's testing
your strength to withstand him.

185
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,239
He's always doing it to me.
Look at your hand.

186
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,228
You're a complete moron.
Nobody is doing anything.

187
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,629
- Gunnar just forgot to turn it off.
- He always makes sure to turn it off.

188
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,631
- That fat pig is hammered!
- Hey, fat and drunk!

189
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,799
So many accusations,
but there may be an explanation.

190
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,235
You should know that he was the
best Danish tennis player in his youth.

191
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:36,037
He won all his matches but then a
ball was mistakenly called to be out.

192
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,915
Gunnar lost
and everything went downhill.

193
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,999
What about Khalid?
This was in his coat pocket.

194
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,034
- What are you saying?
- Those two haven't changed.

195
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,552
- You're a joke.
- Let's forbid people to wear hats.

196
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,154
- It's a balaclava during summer.
- Khalid is from a hot climate.

197
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:08,196
- Here's fucking 17,000 in cash.
- You're reaching, Adam.

198
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,518
Khalid is saving to buy new clothes.
You didn't know.

199
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,553
Give me my phone and my wallet
or I'll smash your face in.

200
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,318
That's not fucking mine!

201
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,230
Stay away from my stuff.
Do you understand?

202
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,629
You're lucky that I'm going back in
because I would beat you every day.

203
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,073
- I'm going to the casualty room,
- Will you pass the market?

204
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,035
- I could.
- Could you get my cough syrup?

205
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,950
- Sure, what's it called?
- Von Osten.

206
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,790
Right. Think about what we can
do about the birds, if you have time.

207
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,393
Here you go. It can't be traced
but throw it away anyway.

208
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,071
Can you shoot with that hand?
Are you going to whack the priest?

209
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,556
He's fucked up.
He got it in the ass as a kid.

210
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,198
- Now he's all turn the other cheek.
- But you're getting out in 11 weeks.

211
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,029
We're waiting for you.
Espen can't control them.

212
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,358
- I'm not going to shoot him.
- I just want to understand.

213
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,473
I need to break him.
All that goodness shit.

214
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,470
Does it involve the pear pie?
Espen says you talk about a pie.

215
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,150
It's an apple cake, okay?
It doesn't matter.

216
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,433
I said that I would bake a cake
and the idiot won't let up.

217
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:06,034
He says that the Devil is testing us
because birds are eating the apples.

218
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,231
Do you need help?

219
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,116
Who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

220
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,516
See you.

221
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,111
Go on.
Get them!

222
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,153
Don't be afraid.
Go on. Get them.

223
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,878
- He's making them nervous.
- They care fucking not about the cat.

224
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,232
- All can see.
- Yes. Lambert is not working.

225
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,193
My granddad
had a cherry tree.

226
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:15,272
It was attacked by birds, so he shot
a few in the morning and evening.

227
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,710
Shot them?
With a gun?

228
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,229
No, a waffle iron.

229
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,069
Of course it was a gun.
What gun?

230
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,272
One like this.

231
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,396
You know what?

232
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,991
I think that we should try it.
Can you take them from there?

233
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,159
Can we guns use?
For sake of fuck, why you not said?

234
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,474
- Well...
- Lambert?

235
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,116
Lambert, are you okay?

236
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,278
What just happened?

237
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,956
He's dead.

238
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,789
- It was a shit cat anyhow.
- He shot my cat.

239
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,073
Let's stop with the accusations.
It was an old cat.

240
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,068
He just happened to fall down
while we were shooting.

241
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,034
If you want
to discuss it now we can.

242
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,958
Okay.

243
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,230
We talked about your grandfather.
Do you know what I think?

244
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,671
I think
it's going to be a good day.

245
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,389
It's too bad that Khalid won't come in
when we're making his favourite food.

246
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,752
- He's embarrassed about Lambert.
- Where did he get the gun?

247
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,670
- Is he a terrorist?
- He wants to return to Saudi Arabia.

248
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,509
You should see his dream house.
It's really nice.

249
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,076
With a bit more Statoil money
he can go home.

250
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:09,229
- Why not just rob a bank
- Khalid is very committed to politics.

251
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,991
He only robs multinational companies.
That's why he robs Statoil.

252
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,673
Statoil stole his father's land for the
oil. Khalid is taking back his property.

253
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,589
- Statoil is Norwegian.
- No, I don't think so.

254
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,112
- Statoil is Norwegian!
- Remember to tell Khalid that.

255
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:34,189
- So lvan knows what he's doing?
- Yes. Ivan just want him to be calm.

256
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,312
Ivan is not exactly normal.

257
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,957
The anniversary
of his wife's death is coming up.

258
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,676
- He had a wife?
- Yes, Linda.

259
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:53,592
She ate some pills and killed herself
because they got a handicapped son.

260
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:00,353
He's got cerebral palsy. He can't
move at all. She couldn't take that.

261
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,951
Can I come in?

262
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:15,396
Adam, there sure is no shortage of
recipes for apple cake in this world.

263
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,950
It looks like we've
won round one.

264
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,516
- What a handsome man. Your father?
- That's Hitler.

265
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,439
No, Hitler had a beard.

266
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,552
You're right. I'm thinking of that
Russian guy. I'll leave you to it.

267
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,356
Hitler's enemies didn't
take him seriously either.

268
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:03,396
Don't you think that I do?
That's just plain rude.

269
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:11,114
Old Paul Nordkap who's in the
hospital with no will to live -

270
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,312
- he was a bigger Nazi than anyone.

271
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,956
Why do you think
they ask me to cheer him up?

272
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,628
Wasn't he in a camp?

273
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,790
Sure. He was working there.
He met Goblins and all those folks.

274
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,629
- Goebbels?
- He was probably also there.

275
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,436
Come with me to visit. Then we
can see who takes who seriously.

276
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,596
Deal?

277
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,628
BOOK OF JOB

278
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,029
Hello!
I'm glad that you could make it.

279
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,837
He's dying. He won't last through
the night. I broke it to him gently.

280
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,874
Well,
let's give him a good sendoff.

281
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,629
- How's the hand?
- Okay.

282
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,073
What about the honker, lvan?
It took quite a beating.

283
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,956
You don't have to waste
money on perfume anymore, lvan.

284
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,958
You won't smell anything again.

285
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,357
Yes.
Come on, Adam.

286
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,837
What's up with you, Poul?
Have you lost your appetite?

287
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:15,353
- I've brought a guest for you.
- Hello. Adam Pedersen.

288
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,951
- Are you feeling a bit low?
- I'm scared.

289
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,913
Relax.
What have you been up to?

290
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,150
- Have the nurses been nicer to you?
- Don't make them. I don't deserve it.

291
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,275
They have been nagging Poul because
of this past but we put a stop to that.

292
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,429
Didn't we, Poul?
Has Miriam been nicer to you?

293
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,510
Yes, she made me hot chocolate
yesterday and tucked me in.

294
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,238
- They are all so nice to me.
- That's good. Don't be upset.

295
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,515
- I don't deserve it. Let it be.
- Everybody deserves to be tucked in.

296
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,952
- Did she fluff your duvet and pillow?
- Yes.

297
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,196
There, there.

298
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,758
I apologise for trying to cheat.

299
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,839
I just don't like
being inside the church.

300
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,352
- That's all forgotten now.
- I know that's what you always say.

301
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,839
I'm scared, lvan.
I dare not sleep. I'm so afraid.

302
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,953
Fiddlesticks!
You have nothing to worry about.

303
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:34,349
Let's focus on the people who cares
for you and all your lovely memories.

304
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,189
Oh God!

305
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,952
Poul, don't cry anymore.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

306
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,799
All has been forgiven.

307
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,519
If you only knew what we did...
All those poor people.

308
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,952
- It can't be forgiven.
- Stop it. Nobody remembers anymore.

309
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,958
Oh God!

310
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,948
Stop your whinging.
It's not as bad as all that.

311
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,119
We all make mistakes
but we don't let it bring us down.

312
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,991
You're crazy, man.

313
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,518
Why do you say that? Why spoil
the mood by being plain rude?

314
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,679
I'd be happy to discuss it,
but this is not the place.

315
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,952
Let's focus on the word of God.

316
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,756
God forgives all, Poul.
God forgives all.

317
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,790
It's difficult.

318
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,676
Even though you seen it before
it's still difficult every time.

319
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,396
- Did you discuss your wife's death?
- Yes, I talked to lots.

320
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:16,517
- A wife's suicide must be painful.
- Yes, that can't be nice.

321
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,508
- Linda didn't take her own life.
- But she took pills?

322
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,350
Yes, but it was an accident.

323
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,516
Accident how?

324
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,477
Christoffer had been playing with her
pills and had put them in a candy dish.

325
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,153
Linda always had a sweet tooth and
she thought they were yellow M&Ms.

326
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,511
Your son Christoffer?

327
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,475
- So he's actually able to move?
- Why wouldn't he be?

328
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,037
- I thought he was paralysed.
- No, I wish.

329
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,756
There's no stopping him. Just
yesterday he was playing rounders.

330
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,671
I don't believe you, lvan.

331
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,512
- I just don't.
- I've never heard anything that crazy.

332
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,669
Has Gunnar told tall stories and
played fast and loose with the truth?

333
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,429
If it is
that's just plain rude.

334
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,153
Why don't you bring him tomorrow?

335
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,672
He's already coming. He's been
pestering me all week to come.

336
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,953
- Good.
- Then you can see for yourself.

337
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,669
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

338
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,475
Christoffer, this is Adam.
Adam, Christoffer.

339
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,150
Maybe you could go say hello.
Yum, eggs.

340
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,395
Small mouthfuls.

341
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,958
- He's paralysed.
- What did you say?

342
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,119
- I have to go in tower.
- You two stay here.

343
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,676
- I need shoot black bird.
- Sit down.

344
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,036
He's paralysed.

345
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,909
Christoffer,
go into daddy's office. Now!

346
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,194
This will not be pleasant to watch.
What did you say?

347
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,188
He's paralysed.
Isn't he paralysed, lvan?

348
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,119
Is he really, Adam?

349
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,029
Yes, he has cerebral palsy.

350
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:34,390
That is just crazy.
Khalid, what do you have to say?

351
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,396
Khalid?

352
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,672
Him is it.

353
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,634
Ivan, he's spastic paralysed.

354
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,909
Your son's a spastic.
Your wife killed herself.

355
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,352
Your mother died giving birth to you.
Your dad raped you.

356
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,751
Look at me, lvan.
Look at me.

357
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,879
You bleeding from an ear. You
bleeding from an ear, for sake of fuck!

358
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,674
The other way.

359
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,315
- Ivan was bleeding from an ear.
- That has happened to me.

360
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,672
Just drink milk.
Plenty of milk.

361
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,677
Just give up, lvan.

362
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,955
There's something
you should know.

363
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,838
Christoffer is recovering from
a very nasty bout of the flu.

364
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,511
I'm the first to admit that
he's been a bit sluggish lately.

365
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,510
- Shut the fuck up!
- If he hurts you turn the other cheek.

366
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,473
God is on my side.

367
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,513
What is his problem?
He needs to be locked up!

368
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,508
I'm not one to gossip -

369
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,315
- but he's always been
considered a phenomenon.

370
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,513
- I don't know if you know?
- How the hell should I know?

371
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:07,511
- He's sick. Very sick.
- I bloody well know that.

372
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:11,508
No, not like that.
Well, he is that too -

373
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,510
- but he's terminally ill.

374
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,510
- What's wrong with him?
- Cancer.

375
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,349
He has a brain tumour
the size of a volleyball.

376
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,553
I've never seen anyone
with such a large brain tumour.

377
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,673
I'll bash your face in
if you call him a walking miracle.

378
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,395
Have you heard about
the Ravashi syndrome?

379
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,398
Ravashi was
an Indian footballer -

380
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,196
- who lost both his feet
in a go-kart accident in 1957.

381
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:52,317
In a state of shock over the accident
he ran home on the stumps of his legs.

382
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,354
His brain blocked the fact
that he had no feet.

383
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,109
For two months
he came to practice.

384
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:06,236
- He kept his midfield position.
- Without feet?

385
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,956
They were a bad team.
They were maybe in the fifth league.

386
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,073
Ivan has experienced
so much hardship -

387
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,512
- that he needs to find an
explanation in order to live with it.

388
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:26,512
That's why he thinks that
the Devil has it in for him.

389
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,510
Ivan would say that
everything is a test.

390
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,111
You're a test, his cancer is a test,
his son's handicap is a test.

391
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:42,236
In lvan's mind he's locked in
fierce battle with the Devil himself.

392
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:48,470
Ivan has no mind to lose and he
blocks out everything like Ravashi.

393
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:54,073
He's in denial about all the bad stuff.
Death, mutilation, hardship, evil.

394
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,671
That simply
doesn't exist in lvan's world.

395
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,239
Why does he bleed from his ears?

396
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:10,390
We have asked ourselves that. I think
it's when something comes too close.

397
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:17,472
Someone once got through to him.
He bled from his ears once before.

398
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,513
That was three years ago.

399
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:26,317
- What happened?
- You don't know his sister Katinka.

400
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,910
A total slapper.
She fucked everybody.

401
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:35,240
I even fucked her when she was
here to have her adenoids removed.

402
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,910
When she died
lvan almost fell to pieces.

403
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,953
He bled from his ears
and got sick.

404
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,516
- What happened then?
- You know lvan.

405
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:52,430
A few days later
he was jolly as ever.

406
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,030
You could kill him by
making him understand?

407
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,073
Yes, in theory.

408
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,393
Give up, Adam.

409
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,673
God is on my side.
Never forget that.

410
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,353
Hi.
The cooker is broken.

411
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,599
- I wanted to make Christoffer a pizza.
- Let's fix it.

412
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,758
- I don't know how.
- We'll get by.

413
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,431
- Where did Christoffer go?
- He's in your office with a woman.

414
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:54,398
She's quite upset. Her name is Sarah
and she's a real hottie.

415
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:00,391
When she saw Christoffer she started
screaming. She didn't want coffee.

416
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,673
Well, we'd better...

417
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,716
So nice of you to visit again.

418
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,196
- Has he been good?
- Tell me he isn't yours.

419
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,315
I can't because this is Christoffer.
Have you two been introduced?

420
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:26,834
- How can you say the things you did?
- Say what kind of things?

421
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:32,478
You said that nothing was wrong
with him. That he could do math.

422
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,719
Yes, he can.
Even the complicated kind.

423
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,669
Adam, maybe you should go get
some of the cookies that Sarah likes.

424
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,715
I'll come too.

425
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,357
Is anyone hungry?

426
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,518
You can hook up the new cooker now.
We'll see if this one lasts a bit longer.

427
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,076
- What are you doing?
- Playing with coins.

428
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,909
- Gunnar is good.
- But you're pregnant.

429
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,079
- It's a bit late for that.
- We're rewriting an article.

430
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,559
- About what?
- The tigers in the Orient.

431
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,992
Here they write that
there's only 400 left.

432
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,113
That's a sure way
to make them extinct.

433
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,518
- Like last round at the pub.
- What do you do then, Gunnar?

434
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,157
- You buy a pint an a chaser.
- The fuck you do!

435
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,557
Gunnar is right.
We have to do something.

436
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,309
- Shut up, man!
- Stay out of it.

437
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,274
Yes, Adam, stop disturbing
us because we're busy.

438
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:35,112
- Five tigers is dying every day.
- Six! Six tigers a day, Adam.

439
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,471
They can really
jump high those tigers.

440
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,673
I'll come right out and say it.
You better come with me.

441
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,398
There's a new apple problem. Shall
we say in five minutes by the tree?

442
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,914
I come and no understand.
I look fruit and see worm.

443
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:29,274
No, I actually discovered it,
but I don't need any credit.

444
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,278
For sake of fuck,
is on all fruit.

445
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,871
That's just plain rude.

446
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,631
Yes, Adam,
it never stops.

447
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:48,188
Let's do something about it. Take
down the sick fruit and spray the rest.

448
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,679
Gunnar, come with me. We have
to arrange Poul's return to God.

449
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,560
BOOK OF JOB

450
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:24,196
Poul Bkel Hermann, known to
friend and foe as Poul Nordkap -

451
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,870
- lived a long and full life.

452
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:32,995
In his life Poul learned that to know
God you must dance with the Devil.

453
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,875
If any Poul Nordkap surely did that.

454
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,039
Poul learned that it's futile
to fight good because -

455
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:47,873
- despite all the cruelty, screaming
and tears he had caused in his youth -

456
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,993
- he realised in the end that
this was just a mere moment.

457
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,875
The ocean heaved
but it was a wasted effort.

458
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:01,200
The world continued
and good prevailed as always.

459
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:07,111
That's why Poul can return
to God with peace of mind.

460
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:12,599
Adam and I were by his side
when he passed quietly away.

461
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,669
His last words were:
"I'm not afraid. I'm ready."

462
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,190
But this is not all about Poul -

463
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:28,238
- because today Christoffer turns nine.
Before we gorge ourselves on cake -

464
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,352
- let's honour Poul
with a hymn.

465
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:36,395
Kaj Munk's number 634.
"You know my heart".

466
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,550
There you are.
I thought you had gone to bed.

467
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,911
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Can't it wait?

468
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:43,875
It has been a long day for
Christoffer with all this attention.

469
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:51,031
- I'd like to talk to you now.
- Okay then.

470
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:56,314
Go into dad's office
and cuddle up under a blanket.

471
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:01,196
What's up with you?
Is the business with the birthday cake?

472
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:06,235
- What if the Devil isn't testing you?
- What do you mean?

473
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:10,069
What if it isn't him
who's been dogging you?

474
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,592
I see.
You're reaching again.

475
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,236
If not the Devil then who?
A little elf?

476
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:23,514
Maybe all the birds, the cooker and
the worms are just a coincidence?

477
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:29,556
- Is that what you're telling people?
- God.

478
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,593
- Pardon?
- God.

479
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:39,596
- I don't understand.
- What if God is on your case?

480
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,995
Why would he do that?

481
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:48,354
Because he hates you.
I've read this book. Book of Job.

482
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,233
- Yes.
- You've read it, right?

483
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:01,593
No. It's about a crocodile.
That's what I've heard.

484
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:06,669
Yes, it's about a crocodile,
but it's also about much more.

485
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,079
Remember God killed Job's cattle?
His seven camels and his ten kids?

486
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,637
He takes everything away from him
and makes him a leper.

487
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,673
Does that
remind you of anything?

488
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,949
I never had a camel.

489
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,436
Look at me.
Look at me, lvan!

490
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,595
You know that God
is behind this, right?

491
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,872
God is not on your side, lvan.

492
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,755
Yes, he is.

493
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:46,877
I don't believe any of this shit.
I just want you to know that it's God.

494
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,153
The Devil hasn't
wasted any time on you.

495
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,669
God wants to kill you.

496
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:59,352
You're just so dense
that you don't get it.

497
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,120
Why are you doing this to me?

498
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,359
Because I'm evil.
You can't change that.

499
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,470
There fire in sky.

500
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:06,151
Him lvan gone?
He forgot moron kid.

501
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,508
For sake of fuck,
it was all fresh!

502
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,030
Every night
we now go to bed hungry.

503
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:23,995
He's done for. You could use him
as a crapper. Have you had coffee?

504
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:29,911
- No. Is he going to...
- Die? You bet your ass he is.

505
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:35,877
Why do you think that the bloke began
bleeding from all orifices in his skull?

506
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,868
I give him four weeks, five tops.

507
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:45,632
From a medical point of view it doesn't
matter. He's come to his senses.

508
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:50,277
Somehow you've managed
to take away his faith.

509
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,792
- That's why I want to buy you coffee.
- It doesn't matter.

510
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,468
Well excuse me.

511
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,870
Are you ready?

512
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:36,834
Get up, lvan,
we need the room.

513
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,951
Go with Adam.

514
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,759
Are you coming?

515
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,040
Call me
when he gets to weak.

516
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:59,028
We'll give him a room
and a shot of morphine.

517
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:31,313
God hates us, Christoffer.

518
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,909
He's always hated us.

519
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,873
It doesn't look too good.

520
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,918
Gather the others.

521
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,472
Well, the fact is...

522
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,635
Adam already knows but...

523
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,951
I'm dying.

524
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,350
- Die how?
- I'll sleep with the worms.

525
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:34,032
- Are you not going to stay?
- No, that would be difficult.

526
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,630
What are we to do?

527
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:41,594
Well, I hope that you...

528
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,396
I don't know.

529
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:54,835
I don't know what you should do.
I don't know anything anymore.

530
01:06:55,040 --> 01:07:01,479
If I said anything that you
can use then do that or don't.

531
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,875
I don't care.

532
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,916
That's all.

533
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:27,751
- Where you're going?
- I feel like a drink. I've earned that.

534
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:32,033
- Gunnar...
- Leave me alone.

535
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,791
- You idiot!
- Gunnar, that's stupid.

536
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,394
You had a hair.

537
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:25,315
Here's one more.
We have three.

538
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,513
- Ivan deserve good cake.
- What the fuck are you doing?

539
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,352
- I'm picking apples.
- With a paki?

540
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:41,915
- What happened?
- Lightning.

541
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:46,750
What's wrong with you?
Are you fucking kidding us?

542
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:52,751
- You climb trees with a nigger.
- That...

543
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:58,751
- Esben, just go home.
- He say go away and take fat friend.

544
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:05,718
Jrgen, let's teach our little
Black friend some manners.

545
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,753
What the fuck are you doing?

546
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,748
I feel stress.
He come with psycho knee.

547
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,839
- He shot me.
- Here witness. Him done before.

548
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,635
- He shot me!
- I say sorry, fatso!

549
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:24,276
- Take him with you.
- You'll regret this.

550
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,916
And you, nigger, you're dead.

551
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:33,759
- You stupid? I have gun.
- You can't just shoot people.

552
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:39,671
He came with that shoulder.
Psycho shoulder. There's his back.

553
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,550
Stop it!

554
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:54,671
I are off balance.
I no like seeing lvan like that.

555
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,317
It's a shitty day.
I want leave this faggot country.

556
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,748
Khalid...
You have to talk to him.

557
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,349
He has problems.

558
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:43,030
Gunnar is also behaving strangely.

559
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:49,473
- Well, you know... They need you.
- Leave me alone.

560
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:56,318
Yes, but just have a talk with them.

561
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,909
They'll listen to you.

562
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,318
I'll put the apples in the fridge.

563
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,999
Do as you please.

564
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:27,911
Gunnar, what are you doing?

565
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:35,430
- Nothing.
- Where's Sarah?

566
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:42,150
- She's gone home.
- What's with all those things?

567
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:46,319
- It's just an aubergine...
- And the racket?

568
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:54,318
It was in.
Everyone said that is was in.

569
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:03,157
- Go on in.
- Not while you are here.

570
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,079
Can I see how you live?

571
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,274
No.

572
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,919
- She got very drunk.
- What have you done?

573
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:29,750
Nothing yet.
She just got drunk.

574
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:33,032
- She wanted it.
- Put that stuff down.

575
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,111
It's her fault for getting that drunk.

576
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,748
Let's go to bed.

577
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:56,599
You come with me.
Go on.

578
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:08,628
- Wow, so many guns.
- Khalid, where are you going?

579
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,956
Statoil must die.

580
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:14,311
- Wouldn't you rather stay here?
- No.

581
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:19,548
- You won't shoot anyone, right?
- Drop it. I no want to shoot you.

582
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,672
You meddle
and I shoot your face.

583
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:28,034
- Can we go with you?
- You want rob with me?

584
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:31,789
- Yes.
- So nice. But no smoke in car.

585
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,993
No.
Get in.

586
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,917
I'll go in first.
I have to use the loo.

587
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:10,309
Okay, but no shooting anyone
before me come in.

588
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:13,592
Hat on, Gunnar.

589
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,355
Is there a back door?
Run! Get out of here!

590
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,313
Get out!
Run!

591
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,510
- Where's employee?
- They ran.

592
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:33,598
For sake of fuck!

593
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:49,074
- Are you done?
- Don't you want some cigarettes?

594
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,550
Stop it!
Let's go!

595
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,596
Are you hurt?

596
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,920
That went well.

597
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,795
You have to talk to lvan.
You need help, both of you.

598
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,470
He also needs help.
Come on.

599
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:44,319
- Take of that hat.
- Yes.

600
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:02,230
- Hi. Where did you go last night?
- We were at the gas station.

601
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:05,910
- Was I very drunk?
- No, you were nice.

602
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:09,669
What are you doing?
Where are the other apples?

603
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:14,556
- We ate them.
- Have you eaten seven apples?

604
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:20,756
- He was hungry. You only had beer.
- For fuck's sake!

605
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:27,752
You look good in that outfit.
Did we fool around yesterday?

606
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:34,836
The girlie boys are here again.
There are more.

607
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,877
- Go into the church.
- I no hide from that bunch of faggots.

608
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:47,834
Look how many they are.
Go into the church.

609
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,393
You can go fuck yourself.

610
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,878
- We just want the paki.
- Will you stop that noise!

611
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:27,759
I really shouldn't have come out here
and ask for some peace and quite.

612
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:31,714
I have six,
maybe seven, days left to live.

613
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,388
I deserve to be able to nap.

614
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:39,469
I can't manage you rude people.
Please leave.

615
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,399
We just want the paki and do him.

616
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:49,233
Do what you want. You can take
him to the woods. I just want peace.

617
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:54,195
- Get him!
- That is just plain rude!

618
01:17:54,400 --> 01:18:00,032
We'll do this another way.
Give me everything that makes noise.

619
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,068
What the fuck was he doing?

620
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,477
Asshole!

621
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,636
- I wasn't my fault.
- Let's get out of here.

622
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:10,320
In medical terms
this is called a half Kennedy.

623
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:14,757
In medical terms
this is called a half Kennedy.

624
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:19,636
He won't get over that.
I can assure you of that.

625
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:25,836
Well, you just say your goodbyes
and I'll stick the kettle on.

626
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:59,318
It's not nice to take the church car.
It's for the dead.

627
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:03,035
Shut up, Gunnar.
So goodbye to you all.

628
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:07,950
- You could stay. Ivan may return.
- Ivan is toasted.

629
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:12,073
I have to go home.
What you say, Adam.

630
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,352
I don't know.
You decide.

631
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,553
I go. I sorry about lvan.
I sorry that you can't make cake.

632
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:23,752
See you, Adam and the Sarah.

633
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,635
Fuck you, Gunnar.

634
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,796
Well, okay.

635
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:48,310
- Go to your room.
- Don't get angry, but...

636
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:56,118
- Where is that from?
- Don't hurt me.

637
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,757
I took it by accident. I'm sorry.
I'll never do it again.

638
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,672
- Enter.
- His bed is empty.

639
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:27,350
- Yes.
- Where is he?

640
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:32,395
It doesn't make sense. I'm a man
of science. I believe in figures.

641
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:36,149
I'm going somewhere
where the sick die -

642
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:42,390
- and don't go sit in the garden with a
cheese burger after having been shot.

643
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:46,070
- Is he in the garden?
- Yes.

644
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,636
He just got up
and went for a walk.

645
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:54,550
The bullet simply
shot the tumour away.

646
01:22:54,760 --> 01:23:01,074
Now they're telling me that the bloke
is well again. I've bloody well had it.

647
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,955
Hi, Adam.

648
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:38,592
- I baked an apple cake.
- Yes.

649
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,795
Should we have a go?

650
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:09,558
- What's the name of the child?
- Ivan Lambert Andersen.

651
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,355
Ivan Lambert Andersen...

652
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,997
I baptise you in the name of the
Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

653
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,156
Amen.

654
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:26,997
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

655
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,668
- Come back.
- No time.

656
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:34,635
- We're going to Indonesia.
- Interesting. Because of the tigers?

657
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:39,868
No, I plan to play tennis again.
They have the best courts.

658
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,594
It's because of junior.

659
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,918
With his Down's syndrome
he'll just look like the others.

660
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:51,591
Yes, tigers are really fascinating.
You're always welcome.

661
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:54,997
- We have to go.
- Don't you have to change?

662
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,953
I'll do it in the car.

663
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,553
Come on, Gunnar.

664
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,515
Arne and Noller.
Ivan Fjeldsted. Call me lvan.

665
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:19,759
Okay then. This is my assistant,
Adam Ole Pedersen.

666
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:23,270
We've been looking forward
to meeting you.

667
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,392
Well, let's go.
I'll take the bags.

668
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,831
What the fuck
is wrong with your eye?

669
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,910
- What do you mean?
- You look like a spastic.

670
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,076
Really?

671
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:40,989
I think that's just
a rude way to break the ice

672
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:45,830
We'll come through town
so let's ask what they think of me.

673
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:50,989
This is not the place for that
discussion because you'll lose.

674
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:57,476
The eye is fine.
We'll discuss it in the car.

675
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:02,310
Good idea with that discussion.
Come on.
