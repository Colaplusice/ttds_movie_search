1
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,556
Lydia! Kitty!

2
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,233
My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard?

3
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,916
Netherfield Park is let at last. Do you
not want to know who has taken it?

4
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,877
As you wish to tell me, my dear,
I doubt I have any choice in the matter.

5
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,397
Kitty, what have I told you
about listening at the door?

6
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,273
There's a Mr Bingley
arrived from the North.

7
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,557
- Five thousand a year!
- Really?

8
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,278
- He's single!
- Who's single?

9
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,040
A Mr Bingley, apparently. Kitty!

10
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,998
How can that possibly affect them?

11
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,236
Mr Bennet,
how can you be so tiresome?

12
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,675
You know he must marry one of them.

13
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,796
That is his design in settling here?

14
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,116
You must go and visit him at once.

15
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,118
Good heavens. People.

16
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,393
For we may not visit if you do not,
as you well know, Mr Bennet.

17
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,599
- Are you listening? You never listen.
- You must, Papa! At once!

18
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,194
There's no need. I already have.

19
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,717
- You have?
- When?

20
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,316
Oh, Mr Bennet,
how can you tease me so?

21
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,795
Have you no compassion
for my poor nerves?

22
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,436
You mistake me, my dear.
I have the highest respect for them.

23
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,757
They've been my constant companions
these twenty years.

24
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,875
Papa!

25
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,274
- Is he amiable?
- Who?

26
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,715
- Is he handsome?
- He's sure to be.

27
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,957
With 5,000 a year,
it would not matter if he had warts.

28
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,439
Who's got warts?

29
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,717
I will consent to
his marrying whichever girl he chooses.

30
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,959
- So will he come to the ball tomorrow?
- I believe so.

31
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,835
- Mr Bennet!
- I have to have your muslin!

32
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,719
- I'll lend you my green slippers!
- They were mine.

33
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,475
- I'll do your mending for a week.
- I'll retrim your new bonnet.

34
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,318
Two weeks I'll do it for.

35
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,197
It's not the same!
It's not the same.

36
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,757
I can't breathe.

37
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,074
I think one of
my toes just came off.

38
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,758
If every man does not end the evening
in love with you,

39
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,638
then I'm no judge of beauty.

40
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,718
- Or men.
- No, they are far too easy to judge.

41
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,359
They're not all bad.

42
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,273
Humourless poppycocks,
in my limited experience.

43
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,635
One day,
someone will catch your eye,

44
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,115
and then you'll have
to watch your tongue.

45
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,674
How good of you to come.

46
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,400
Which of the painted peacocks
is our Mr Bingley?

47
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,199
He's on the right.
On the left is his sister.

48
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,195
- The person with the quizzical brow?
- That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.

49
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,598
- He looks miserable, poor soul.
- He may be, but poor he is not.

50
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,715
Tell me.

51
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,559
10,000 a year,
and he owns half of Derbyshire.

52
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,676
The miserable half.

53
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,636
Mr Bennet, you must introduce him
to the girls immediately.

54
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,238
Smile at Mr Bingley. Smile.

55
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,075
Mary.

56
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,078
Mr Bingley, my eldest daughter you know.

57
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,438
Mrs Bennet, Miss Jane Bennet,
Elizabeth and Miss Mary Bennet.

58
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,195
It is a pleasure. I have two others,
but they're already dancing.

59
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,635
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.

60
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,914
And may I introduce Mr Darcy
of Pemberley in Derbyshire.

61
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,876
How do you like it
here in Hertfordshire?

62
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,957
Very much.

63
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,317
The library at Netherfield,
I've heard, is one of the finest.

64
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,758
It fills me with guilt. I'm not a good
reader. I prefer being out of doors.

65
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,394
Oh, I mean, I can read, of course.

66
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,876
And I'm not suggesting
you can't read out of doors.

67
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,635
I wish I read more, but there
seem to be so many other things to do.

68
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,995
That's exactly what I meant.

69
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,754
Mama, Mama! You will never, ever believe
what we're about to tell you.

70
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,434
- Tell me!
- She's going to take the veil.

71
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,875
- The regiment are coming!
- Officers?

72
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,157
They're going to be stationed
the whole winter, right here.

73
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,754
- Officers?
- As far as the eye can see.

74
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,714
Oh, look.
Jane's dancing with Mr Bingley.

75
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,313
Mr Bennet.

76
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,833
- Do you dance, Mr Darcy?
- Not if I can help it.

77
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,918
I didn't know you were coming
to see me. What's the matter?

78
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,558
We are a long way from Grosvenor Square,
are we not, Mr Darcy?

79
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,836
I've never seen so many pretty girls.

80
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,395
You were dancing
with the only handsome girl.

81
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,438
She is the most beautiful creature
I have ever beheld.

82
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,798
- But her sister Elizabeth is agreeable.
- Perfectly tolerable.

83
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,078
Not handsome enough to tempt me. Return
to your partner and enjoy her smiles.

84
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,595
You're wasting your time with me.

85
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,757
Count your blessings, Lizzie. If he
liked you, you'd have to talk to him.

86
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,154
Precisely.

87
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,954
I wouldn't dance with him
for all of Derbyshire,

88
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,395
let alone the miserable half.

89
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,879
Wait!

90
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,399
- I enjoyed that so much, Miss Lucas.
- How well you dance, Mr Bingley.

91
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,755
I've never enjoyed a dance so much.

92
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,679
My daughter Jane
is a splendid dancer, is she not?

93
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,717
She is indeed.

94
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,757
Your friend Miss Lucas
is a most amusing young woman.

95
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,558
Oh, yes, I adore her.

96
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,713
- It is a pity she's not more handsome.
- Mama!

97
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,236
Oh, but Lizzie
would never admit that she's plain.

98
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,473
Of course, it's my Jane who's considered
the beauty of the county.

99
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,595
Mama, please!

100
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,758
When she was 15, a gentleman
was so much in love with her,

101
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,036
I was sure he would make her an offer.

102
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,636
However, he did write her
some very pretty verses.

103
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,994
And that put paid to it.

104
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,436
I wonder who discovered the power
of poetry in driving away love.

105
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,837
- I thought poetry was the food of love.
- Of a fine, stout love.

106
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,356
But if it is only a vague inclination,
one poor sonnet will kill it.

107
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,438
So, what do you recommend
to encourage affection?

108
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,117
Dancing. Even if one's partner
is barely tolerable.

109
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,996
Mr Bingley is just what
a young man ought to be.

110
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,516
- Sensible, good-humoured...
- Handsome, conveniently rich...

111
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,399
Marriage should not be driven
by thoughts of money.

112
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,676
Only deep love
will persuade me to marry.

113
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,317
- Which is why I'll end up an old maid.
- Do you really believe he liked me?

114
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,836
He danced with you most of the night,
and stared at you the rest.

115
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,878
I give you leave to like him.
You've liked many stupider.

116
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,197
You're a great deal too apt
to like people in general.

117
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,237
All the world
is good in your eyes.

118
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,557
Not his friend. I still can't believe
what he said about you.

119
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,035
Mr Darcy?

120
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,796
I'd more easily forgive his vanity
had he not wounded mine.

121
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,633
But no matter.
I doubt we shall ever speak again.

122
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,916
He danced with Miss Lucas.

123
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,877
We were all there, dear.

124
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,076
It is a shame she's not more handsome.

125
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,879
There's a spinster
in the making and no mistake.

126
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,600
The fourth with a Miss King
of little standing,

127
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,796
and the fifth again with Jane.

128
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,117
If he had any compassion,
he would've sprained his ankle.

129
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,395
The way you carry on,

130
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,518
you'd think our girls look forward
to a grand inheritance.

131
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,875
When you die,
which may be very soon,

132
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,397
they will be left without a roof over
their head nor a penny to their name.

133
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,996
- Please, it's ten in the morning.
- A letter to Miss Bennet, ma'am.

134
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,516
From Netherfield Hall.

135
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,235
Praise the Lord. We are saved!

136
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,195
Make haste, Jane,
make haste. Oh, happy day!

137
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,074
It is from Caroline Bingley.

138
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,796
She has invited me to dine with her.

139
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,918
- Her brother will be dining out.
- Dining out?

140
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,957
- Can I take the carriage?
- Let me see.

141
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,675
- It is too far to walk.
- This is unaccountable of him.

142
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,677
Mama, the carriage for Jane?

143
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,156
Certainly not. She'll go on horseback.

144
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,075
Horseback!

145
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,558
Lizzie.

146
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,957
Now she'll have to stay the night,
exactly as I predicted.

147
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,157
Good grief, woman,
your skills in the art of matchmaking

148
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,117
are positively occult.

149
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,717
Though I don't think, Mama,
you can take credit for making it rain.

150
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,756
"My friends will not hear of me
returning home until I am better.

151
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,833
Excepting a sore throat, a fever and
a headache, nothing is wrong with me."

152
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,994
If Jane does die it will be a comfort
to know it was in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

153
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,395
People do not die of colds.

154
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,836
But she may perish with the
shame of having such a mother.

155
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,559
I must go to Netherfield at once.

156
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,955
Lady Bathurst is redecorating
her ballroom in the French style.

157
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,197
A little unpatriotic, don't you think?

158
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,438
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

159
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,716
Good Lord, did you walk here?

160
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,839
I did.

161
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,753
- I'm so sorry. How is my sister?
- She's upstairs.

162
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,757
Thank you.

163
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,556
My goodness, did you
see her hem? Six inches deep in mud.

164
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,796
She looked positively mediaeval.

165
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,317
I feel such a terrible imposition.
They're being so kind to me.

166
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,838
I don't know who is more pleased at your
being here, Mama or Mr Bingley.

167
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,154
Thank you for tending
to my sister so diligently.

168
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,555
She's in far better comfort
than at home.

169
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,358
It's a pleasure.

170
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,235
I mean, it's not a pleasure
that she's ill. Of course not.

171
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,115
It's a pleasure that she's here,
being ill.

172
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,355
Not going to be famous, our pig.

173
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,717
Black on the back, but not related
to the learned pig of Norwich.

174
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,878
- Now that pig is...
- Mr Bennet.

175
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,237
It's all going to plan.
He's half in love with her already.

176
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,556
- Who is, blossom?
- Mr Bingley.

177
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,955
He doesn't mind
that she hasn't a penny.

178
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,276
He has more than enough
for the two of them.

179
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,357
- How will we meet them?
- Easy!

180
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,555
Wait for me!

181
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,919
You drop something. They
pick it up. And then you're introduced.

182
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,275
Officers!

183
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,437
You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

184
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,596
You're mistaken. I write slowly.

185
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,236
How many letters you must have occasion
to write, Mr Darcy.

186
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,153
Letters of business.
How odious I should think them.

187
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,073
It is fortunate, then,
they fall to me and not you.

188
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,674
Tell your sister I long to see her.

189
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,077
- I've already told her once.
- I do dote on her.

190
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,357
I was quite in raptures
at her beautiful design for a table.

191
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,637
Perhaps you will give me leave
to defer your raptures.

192
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,836
I have not room enough
to do them justice.

193
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,759
You young ladies are so accomplished.

194
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,276
- What do you mean?
- You paint tables, play the piano

195
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,793
and embroider cushions.

196
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,997
I never heard of a lady,
but people say she's accomplished.

197
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,316
The word is applied too liberally.

198
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,556
I do not know more than
half a dozen women

199
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,393
- that are truly accomplished.
- Nor I.

200
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,597
Goodness, you must comprehend
a great deal in the idea.

201
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,318
- I do.
- Absolutely.

202
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,035
She must have a knowledge of music,
singing, drawing, dancing

203
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,397
and the modern languages
to deserve the word.

204
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,275
And something in her air
and manner of walking.

205
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,233
And she must improve her mind
by extensive reading.

206
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,995
I'm no longer surprised at your knowing
only six accomplished women.

207
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,357
- I wonder at you knowing any.
- Are you so severe on your own sex?

208
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,838
I never saw such a woman. She would
certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.

209
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,516
Miss Elizabeth,
let us take a turn about the room.

210
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,556
It's refreshing, is it not,
after sitting so long in one attitude?

211
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,877
It is a small kind of accomplishment,
I suppose.

212
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,156
Will you not join us, Mr Darcy?

213
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,716
You can only have two motives,
and I would interfere with either.

214
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,876
What can he mean?

215
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,157
The surest way to disappoint him
would be to ask him nothing.

216
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,999
Do tell us, Mr Darcy.

217
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,195
Either you are
in each other's confidence

218
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,396
and you have
secret affairs to discuss,

219
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,716
or you are conscious
that your figures

220
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,957
appear to the greatest
advantage by walking.

221
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,033
If the first,
I should get in your way.

222
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,998
If the second,
I can admire you much better from here.

223
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,435
How shall we punish him
for such a speech?

224
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,479
- We could laugh at him.
- No. Mr Darcy is not to be teased.

225
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,156
Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would
you consider pride a fault or a virtue?

226
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,198
- I couldn't say.
- We're trying to find a fault in you.

227
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,358
I find it hard to forgive
the follies and vices of others,

228
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,238
or their offences against me.

229
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,796
My good opinion,
once lost, is lost forever.

230
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,717
Oh, dear.
I cannot tease you about that.

231
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,916
What a shame,
for I dearly love to laugh.

232
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,236
A family trait, I think.

233
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,839
A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet,
a Miss Bennet and a Miss Bennet, sir.

234
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,878
Are we to receive every
Bennet in the country?

235
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,677
What an excellent room you have, sir.

236
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,355
Such expensive furnishings.

237
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,398
I do hope
you intend to stay here, Mr Bingley.

238
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,196
Absolutely, I find the country
very diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?

239
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,998
I find it perfectly adequate.

240
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,953
Even if society
is a little less varied than in town.

241
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,917
Less varied? Not at all.

242
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,999
We dine with four and 20 families
of all shapes and sizes.

243
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,438
Sir William Lucas, for instance,
is a very agreeable man.

244
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,235
And a good deal less self-important
than some people half his rank.

245
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,955
Mr Bingley,
is it true you will hold a ball here?

246
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,599
A ball?

247
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,276
It would be an excellent way to meet new
friends. You could invite the militia.

248
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,357
- Oh, do hold a ball!
- Kitty!

249
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,274
When your sister recovers,
you shall name the day.

250
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,797
I think a ball is an irrational way
to gain new acquaintance.

251
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,959
It would be better if conversation,
not dancing, were the order of the day.

252
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,079
Indeed, much more rational,
but rather less like a ball.

253
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,798
Thank you, Mary.

254
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,958
What a fine imposing place to be sure,
is it not, my dears?

255
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,317
There's no house
to equal it in the county.

256
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,158
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Bennet.

257
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,039
- There she is.
- I don't know how to thank you.

258
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,919
You're welcome any time
you feel the least bit poorly.

259
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,117
Thank you for your stimulating company.
Most instructive.

260
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,716
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.

261
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,157
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Elizabeth.

262
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,835
And then there was one
with great long lashes, like a cow.

263
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,639
Ask Mrs Hill
to order us a sirloin, Betsy.

264
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,076
Just the one, mind.
We're not made of money.

265
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,194
I hope, my dear,
you've ordered a good dinner today.

266
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,075
I've reason to expect
an addition to our family party.

267
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,919
His name's Mr Collins,
the dreaded cousin.

268
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,435
- Who is to inherit?
- Everything.

269
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,359
Even my piano stool
belongs to Mr Collins.

270
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,475
When?

271
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,558
He may turn us out of the house
as soon as he pleases.

272
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,877
The estate passes directly to him
and not to us poor females.

273
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,196
Mr Collins, at your service.

274
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,954
What a superbly featured room
and what excellent potatoes.

275
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,913
It's many years since
I've had such an exemplary vegetable.

276
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,198
To which fair cousin should I compliment
the excellence of the cooking?

277
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,755
We are perfectly able to keep a cook.

278
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,797
Excellent.

279
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,236
I'm very pleased
the estate can afford such a living.

280
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,916
I'm honoured to have as my patroness
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

281
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,594
You've heard of her, I presume?

282
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,594
My small rectory abuts her estate,

283
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,320
Rosings Park,
and she often condescends

284
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,077
to drive by my humble dwelling
in her little phaeton and ponies.

285
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,798
Does she have any family?

286
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,278
One daughter, the heiress of Rosings
and very extensive property.

287
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,516
I've often observed to Lady Catherine

288
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,638
that her daughter
seemed born to be a duchess,

289
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:26,358
for she has all the superior graces
of elevated rank.

290
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,155
These kind of compliments
are always acceptable to the ladies,

291
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,478
and which I conceive myself
particularly bound to pay.

292
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,074
How happy for you, Mr Collins,

293
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,676
to possess the talent for flattering
with such delicacy.

294
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,036
Do these attentions proceed
from the impulse of the moment

295
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,555
or are they
the result of previous study?

296
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,194
They arise
from what is passing at the time.

297
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,598
And though I do sometimes amuse myself
with arranging such little compliments,

298
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,236
I always wish to give them
as unstudied an air as possible.

299
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,353
Oh, believe me, no one would suspect
your manners to be rehearsed.

300
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,156
After dinner, I thought
I might read to you for an hour or two.

301
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,198
<i>I have with me Fordyce's Sermons</i>

302
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,638
which speak very eloquently
on all matters moral.

303
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,038
<i>Are you familiar with Fordyce's Sermons,
Miss Bennet?</i>

304
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,555
Mrs Bennet, I have been bestowed by the
good grace of Lady Catherine de Bourgh

305
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,075
a parsonage of no mean size.

306
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,276
I have become aware of the fact.

307
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,234
It is my avowed hope
that soon I may find a mistress for it.

308
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,676
And I have to inform you
that the eldest Miss Bennet

309
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,515
has captured my special attention.

310
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,314
Oh, Mr Collins.

311
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,439
Unfortunately, it is incumbent upon me

312
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,596
to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet
is very soon to be engaged.

313
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,034
Engaged.

314
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,555
But Miss Lizzie,
next to her in age and beauty,

315
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,036
would make anyone an excellent partner.

316
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,079
Do not you agree? Mr Collins?

317
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,438
Indeed. Indeed.

318
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,995
A very agreeable alternative.

319
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,556
Mr Collins is a man who
makes you despair at the entire sex.

320
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,838
- Yours, I believe.
- Oh, Mr Wickham, how perfect you are.

321
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,077
He picked up my handkerchief.
Did you drop yours on purpose?

322
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,639
Mr Wickham is a lieutenant.

323
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,519
- An enchanted lieutenant.
- What are you up to, Liddy?

324
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,638
- We happened to be looking for ribbon.
- White, for the ball.

325
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,274
Shall we all look
for some ribbon together?

326
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,556
- Good afternoon, Mr James.
- Miss Lydia, Miss Bennet.

327
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,193
I shan't even browse.

328
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,999
I can't be trusted.
I have poor taste in ribbons.

329
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,594
Only a truly confident man
would admit that.

330
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,159
No, it's true.

331
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,357
And buckles.
When it comes to buckles, I'm lost.

332
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,796
- You must be the shame of the regiment.
- The laughing stock.

333
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,958
What do your superiors do with you?

334
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,399
Ignore me. I'm of next to no importance,
so it's easily done.

335
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,557
- Lizzie, lend me some money.
- You already owe me a fortune.

336
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,836
- Allow me to oblige.
- No, Mr Wickham, please...

337
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,275
I insist.

338
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,278
- I pity the French.
- So do I.

339
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,000
- Look, Mr Bingley.
- Mr Bingley!

340
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,276
I was just on my way to your house.

341
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,438
How do you like
my ribbons for your ball?

342
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,916
- Very beautiful.
- She is. Look, she's blooming.

343
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,638
Oh, Lydia.

344
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,276
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham.
He is a credit to his profession.

345
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,637
You can't invite people
to other people's balls.

346
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,316
Of course, you must come, Mr Wickham.

347
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,758
If you'll excuse me,
ladies, enjoy the day.

348
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,437
Do you plan to go
to the Netherfield ball, Mr Wickham?

349
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,913
Perhaps. How long
has Mr Darcy been a guest there?

350
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,877
About a month.

351
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,353
Forgive me, but are you
acquainted with him, with Mr Darcy?

352
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,638
Indeed, I've been connected
with his family since infancy.

353
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,516
You may well be surprised,
given our cold greeting this afternoon.

354
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,556
I hope your plans in favour
of Meryton will not be affected

355
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,599
- by your relations with the gentleman.
- It is not for me to be driven away.

356
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,515
If he wishes to avoid seeing me,
he must go, not I.

357
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,157
I must ask, what is the manner
of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

358
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,277
My father managed his estate.

359
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,517
We grew up together, Darcy and I.

360
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:26,437
His father treated me like a second son,
loved me like a son.

361
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,995
We were both with him the day he died.

362
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,717
With his last breath,

363
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,917
his father bequeathed me
the rectory in his estate.

364
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,556
He knew I had my heart set
on joining the Church.

365
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,917
But Darcy ignored his wishes
and gave the living to another man.

366
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,793
- But why?
- Jealousy.

367
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,234
His father...

368
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,358
Well, he loved me better
and Darcy couldn't stand it.

369
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,960
- How cruel.
- So now I'm a poor foot-soldier.

370
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,715
Too lowly even to be noticed.

371
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,078
- Breathe in!
- I can't anymore. You're hurting.

372
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,315
Betsy.

373
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,958
Betsy!

374
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,993
- There must've been a misunderstanding.
- Jane, you never think ill of anybody.

375
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,596
How could Mr Darcy do such a thing?

376
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,957
I will discover the truth
from Mr Bingley this evening.

377
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,355
Let Mr Darcy contradict it himself.

378
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,715
Till he does,
I hope never to encounter him.

379
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,075
Poor, unfortunate, Mr Wickham.

380
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,316
Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.

381
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,075
And, let us hope,
a rather more willing dancer.

382
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,838
There they are, look.

383
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,037
- Oh, yes.
- Billy.

384
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,436
Jane Martin is here.

385
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,596
May I say what an immense pleasure
it is to see you again.

386
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,756
- Mrs Bennet.
- Miss Bingley.

387
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,915
Charming.

388
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,477
I'm so pleased you're here.

389
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,756
So am I.

390
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,715
And how are you? Miss Elizabeth?
Are you looking for someone?

391
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,198
No, not at all, I was just admiring
the general splendour.

392
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,955
- It is breathtaking, Mr Bingley.
- Good.

393
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,076
You might have passed
a few pleasantries with Mr Bingley.

394
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,835
I've never met a
more pleasant gentleman in all my years.

395
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,395
Did you see how he dotes on her?

396
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:32,076
Dear Jane,
always doing what's best for her family.

397
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,757
- Charlotte!
- Lizzie!

398
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:55,516
- Have you seen Mr Wickham?
- No. Perhaps he's through here.

399
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,398
Lizzie, Mr Wickham is not here.
Apparently, he's been detained.

400
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,717
Detained where? He must be here.

401
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,959
- There you are.
- Mr Collins.

402
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,476
Perhaps you will do me the honour,
Miss Elizabeth.

403
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,593
Oh, I did not think you danced,
Mr Collins.

404
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,117
I do not think it incompatible
with the office of a clergyman.

405
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,556
Several people, her Ladyship
included, have complimented me

406
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,235
on my lightness of foot.

407
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,396
Apparently, your Mr Wickham has
been called on some business to town.

408
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,479
Dancing is of little consequence
to me, but it does...

409
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,076
...but it does afford
the opportunity to lavish...

410
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,078
...upon one's partner attentions...
- My informer tells me...

411
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,115
...that he would be less inclined
to be engaged, were it not for...

412
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,436
...the presence
of a certain gentleman.

413
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,596
Which is my primary object.

414
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,473
That gentleman barely warrants the name.

415
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,438
It is my intention, if I may be so bold,

416
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,034
to remain close to you
throughout the evening.

417
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,195
May I have the next dance,
Miss Elizabeth?

418
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,197
You may.

419
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,879
- Did I agree to dance with Mr Darcy?
- I dare say you will find him amiable.

420
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,875
It would be most inconvenient since I've
sworn to loathe him for all eternity.

421
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,915
- I love this dance.
- Indeed. Most invigorating.

422
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,235
It is your turn to say something,
Mr Darcy.

423
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,079
I talked about the dance.

424
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,916
Now you ought to remark on the size
of the room or the number of couples.

425
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,993
I'm perfectly happy to oblige.
What would you like most to hear?

426
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,355
That reply will do for present.

427
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,516
Perhaps by and by I may observe

428
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,757
that private balls
are much pleasanter than public ones.

429
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,277
For now, we may remain silent.

430
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,638
Do you talk as a rule while dancing?

431
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,515
No. No, I prefer to be
unsociable and taciturn.

432
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,636
Makes it all so much more enjoyable,
don't you think?

433
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,674
Tell me, do you and your sisters
very often walk to Meryton?

434
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,556
Yes, we often walk to Meryton.

435
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,553
It's a great opportunity
to meet new people.

436
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,114
When you met us, we'd just had the
pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.

437
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,959
Mr Wickham's blessed with such happy
manners, he's sure of making friends.

438
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,759
Whether he's capable
of retaining them is less so.

439
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:08,438
He's been so unfortunate as to lose
your friendship. That is irreversible?

440
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,599
- It is. Why do you ask such a question?
- To make out your character.

441
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,115
- What have you discovered?
- Very little.

442
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,716
I hear such different accounts
of you as puzzle me exceedingly.

443
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,474
I hope to afford you more clarity
in the future.

444
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,993
- Is that Mr Darcy of Pemberley?
- I believe so.

445
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,878
I must make myself known to him.

446
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,838
He's a nephew of my patroness,
Lady Catherine.

447
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,833
He will consider it an impertinence.

448
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,434
Mr Darcy.

449
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,636
Mr Darcy.

450
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,276
Mr Darcy. Good evening...

451
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,278
What interesting relatives you have.

452
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,635
Mary, dear,
you've delighted us long enough.

453
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,037
Let the other young ladies have a turn.

454
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,514
... since I was a child,
and then she died.

455
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,318
I have a beautiful grey.

456
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,195
Of course, Caroline's
a much better rider than I, of course.

457
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,198
Oh, yes. We fully expect
a most advantageous marriage.

458
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,279
And my Jane, marrying so grand,
must throw her sisters in the way.

459
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,355
Clearly my family are seeing who can
expose themselves to the most ridicule.

460
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,314
- At least Bingley has not noticed.
- No.

461
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,836
- I think he likes her very much.
- But does she like him?

462
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,959
Few of us are secure enough to be
in love without proper encouragement.

463
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,395
Bingley likes her enormously,

464
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,194
but might not do more
if she does not help him on.

465
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,955
She's just shy. If he cannot
perceive her regard, he is a fool.

466
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,475
We are all fools in love.

467
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,518
He does not know
her character as we do.

468
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,995
She should move fast
and snap him up.

469
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,436
There is plenty of time
for us to get to know him afterwards.

470
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,355
I can't help feeling
that someone's going to produce a piglet

471
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,397
and make us chase it.

472
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,437
- Oh, dear!
- I do apologise, sir.

473
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,394
I'm awfully sorry. Do forgive me.

474
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,276
Emily, please!

475
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,918
Mary, my dear Mary.
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

476
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,117
- I've been practising all week.
- I know, my dear.

477
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,595
I hate balls.

478
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,995
Mr Bennet, wake up.

479
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,676
Oh, I've never had such a good time!

480
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,235
Charles, you cannot be serious.

481
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,319
We'll have a wedding here in less than
three months if you ask me, Mr Bennet.

482
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,473
Mr Bennet!

483
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,554
Mary, please.

484
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,515
Thank you, Mr Hill.

485
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,438
Mrs Bennet, I was hoping,
if it would not trouble you,

486
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,077
that I might solicit
a private audience with Miss Elizabeth.

487
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,718
Oh, certainly,
Lizzie would be very happy indeed.

488
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,078
Everyone, out. Mr Collins would like
a private audience with your sister.

489
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,478
Wait, Mr Collins can have nothing
to say to me that anybody need not hear.

490
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,434
I desire you will stay where you are.
Everyone else to the drawing room.

491
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,079
- Mr Bennet.
- But...

492
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,515
Now.

493
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,076
- Jane. Jane, don't... Jane!
- Jane.

494
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,598
Papa, stay.

495
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,598
Dear Miss Elizabeth,

496
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,236
My attentions have been
too marked to be mistaken.

497
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,715
Almost as soon
as I entered the house,

498
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,835
I singled you out
as the companion of my future life.

499
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,600
But before I am run away
with my feelings,

500
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,399
perhaps I may state
my reasons for marrying.

501
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,915
Firstly, that it is
the duty of a clergyman

502
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,640
to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.

503
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,634
Secondly, I am convinced
it will add greatly to my happiness.

504
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,598
And thirdly,
that it is at the urging

505
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,196
of my esteemed patroness,
Lady Catherine,

506
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,635
that I select a wife.

507
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,798
My object in coming to Longbourn
was to choose such a one

508
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,916
from among Mr Bennet's daughters,

509
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,878
for I am to inherit the estate

510
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,077
and such an alliance will surely...

511
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,037
...suit everyone.

512
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,477
And now nothing remains but for me to
assure you in the most animated language

513
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,074
- of the violence of my affections.
- Mr Collins!

514
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,316
And no reproach
on the subject of fortune

515
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,957
- will cross my lips once we're married.
- You forget I have given no answer.

516
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,556
Lady Catherine will
thoroughly approve when I speak to her

517
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,635
of your modesty, economy
and other amiable qualities.

518
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,316
Sir, I am honoured by your proposal,
but I regret that I must decline it.

519
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,194
I know ladies
don't seek to seem too eager...

520
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,915
Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious.
You could not make me happy.

521
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,595
And I'm the last woman
in the world who could make you happy.

522
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,157
I flatter myself that your refusal
is merely a natural delicacy.

523
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,039
Besides, despite manifold attractions,

524
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,318
it is by no means certain another offer
of marriage will ever be made to you.

525
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,956
I must conclude that you simply seek
to increase my love by suspense,

526
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,358
according to the usual practice
of elegant females.

527
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,956
I am not the sort of female
to torment a respectable man.

528
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,554
Please understand me,
I cannot accept you.

529
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,557
Headstrong, foolish child.

530
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:59,877
Don't worry, Mr Collins. We'll have this
little hiccup dealt with immediately.

531
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,316
Lizzie. Lizzie!

532
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,398
Mr Bennet, we're all in an uproar!

533
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,115
You must come
and make Lizzie marry Mr Collins.

534
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,635
Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie,

535
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,276
but she vowed she will not have him,
and now the danger is

536
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,159
Mr Collins may not have Lizzie.

537
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,757
- What am I to do?
- Well, come and talk to her.

538
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,035
Now!

539
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,158
- Tell her you insist they marry.
- Papa, please.

540
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,233
You will have this house
and save your sisters from destitution.

541
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,233
- I can't marry him.
- Go and say you've changed your mind.

542
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,834
- Think of your family.
- You cannot make me.

543
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,434
Mr Bennet, say something.

544
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,397
Your mother insists
upon you marrying Mr Collins.

545
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,194
Yes, or I shall never see her again.

546
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,194
From this day onward, you must be
a stranger to one of your parents.

547
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,715
Who will maintain you
when your father is dead?

548
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,595
Your mother will never see you again
if you do not marry Mr Collins,

549
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,797
and I will never see you again
if you do.

550
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,518
Thank you, Papa.

551
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,557
Ungrateful child!
I shall never speak to you again.

552
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,320
Not that I take
much pleasure in talking.

553
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,919
People who suffer as I do
from nervous complaints

554
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,958
can have no pleasure
in talking to anybody.

555
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,798
Jane!

556
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,919
What's the matter? Jane?

557
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,476
I don't understand
what would take him from Netherfield.

558
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,835
Why does he not know when he'll return?

559
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,115
Read it.

560
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,437
"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister
and we are scarcely less eager.

561
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,438
I do not think Georgiana Darcy
has her equal for beauty,

562
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,354
elegance and accomplishment.
I hope to call her hereafter my sister."

563
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,114
Is that not clear enough?

564
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,874
Caroline sees her brother
in love with you

565
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,600
and has taken him off
to persuade him otherwise.

566
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,515
But I know her to be incapable
of wilfully deceiving anyone.

567
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:27,157
- It's more likely he does not love me.
- He loves you. Do not give up.

568
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,236
Go to our aunt and uncle's in London,

569
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,876
let it be known you are there
and I am sure he will come to you.

570
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:48,517
Give my love to my sister
and try not to be a burden, dear.

571
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,035
Poor Jane.

572
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,438
Still, a girl likes to be
crossed in love now and then.

573
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,556
It gives her something to think of

574
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,757
and a sort of distinction
amongst her companions.

575
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,635
- I'm sure that will cheer her up, Papa.
- It's your turn now, Lizzie.

576
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,637
You've turned down Collins.

577
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,918
You're free to go off
and be jilted yourself.

578
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,877
What about Mr Wickham?

579
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,713
He's a pleasant fellow
and he'd do the job credibly.

580
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,395
- Father...
- And you have an affectionate mother

581
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,036
who would make the most of it.

582
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,716
- Charlotte!
- My dear Lizzie.

583
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,199
I've come her to tell you the news.
Mr Collins and I are... engaged.

584
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,555
- Engaged?
- Yes.

585
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,676
- To be married?
- What other kind of engaged is there?

586
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,276
For heaven's sake, Lizzie,
don't look at me like that.

587
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,318
I should be
as happy with him as any other.

588
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,193
- But he's ridiculous.
- Oh, hush.

589
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,955
Not all of us can afford to be romantic.

590
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,795
I've been offered
a comfortable home and protection.

591
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,598
There's a lot to be thankful for.

592
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,999
I'm 27 years old.
I've no money and no prospects.

593
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,596
I'm already a burden to my parents.

594
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,115
And I'm frightened.

595
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,637
So dont judge me, Lizzie.
Don't you dare judge me.

596
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,719
<i>Dear Charlotte,
thank you for your letter.</i>

597
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,037
<i>I'm glad the house,
furniture and roads are to your taste,</i>

598
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,476
<i>and that Lady Catherine's behaviour
is friendly and obliging.</i>

599
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,200
<i>What with your departure,
Jane's to London</i>

600
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,716
<i>and the militia to the North
with the colourful Mr Wickham,</i>

601
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,634
<i>I must confess, the view
from where I sit has been rather grey.</i>

602
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,673
<i>As for the favour you ask,
it is no favour at all.</i>

603
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,799
<i>I would be happy to visit you
at your earliest convenience.</i>

604
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,196
Welcome to our humble abode.

605
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,915
My wife encourages me to spend time
in the garden for my health.

606
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,355
I think our guest is tired
after her journey.

607
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,997
I plan many improvements. I intend to
throw out a bough and plant a lime walk.

608
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,993
I flatter myself
that any young lady would be happy

609
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,038
to be the mistress of such a house.

610
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,957
We shan't be disturbed here.

611
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,835
This parlour is for
my own particular use.

612
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,393
Oh, Lizzie, it's such a pleasure
to run my own home.

613
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,438
- Charlotte, come here!
- What's happened?

614
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,434
Has the pig escaped again?
Oh, it's Lady Catherine.

615
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,034
Come and see, Lizzie.

616
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,714
Great news.

617
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,997
We received an invitation to Rosings
from Lady Catherine.

618
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,639
How wonderful!

619
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,678
Do not make yourself uneasy
about your apparel.

620
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,075
Just put on the best you've brought.

621
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,597
Lady Catherine's never been averse
to the truly humble.

622
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,716
One of the most extraordinary
sights in all of Europe.

623
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,276
The glazing alone
costs upwards of 20,000.

624
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,914
Come along. Come along.

625
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,158
A little later we'll play cards.

626
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,833
Your Ladyship.

627
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,878
Miss de Bourgh.

628
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,876
- So, you are Elizabeth Bennet?
- I am, your Ladyship.

629
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,755
This is my daughter.

630
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:07,157
- It's kind of you to ask us to dine.
- The rug alone cost upwards of 300.

631
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,916
Mr Darcy.

632
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,236
What are you doing here?

633
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,636
Mr Darcy,
I had no idea we had the honour.

634
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:26,235
- Miss Elizabeth, I'm a guest here.
- You know my nephew?

635
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,116
I had the pleasure
of meeting your nephew in Hertfordshire.

636
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,914
Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do?

637
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:44,997
Mr Collins, you can't sit
next to your wife. Move. Over there.

638
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,235
Harvey, I wonder,
could you get me the fish course...

639
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,313
I trust your family is in good health,
Miss Elizabeth?

640
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,357
They are, thank you.

641
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,798
My eldest sister is in London.
Perhaps you saw her there.

642
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,877
I haven't been fortunate enough...

643
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:23,278
Do you play the pianoforte,
Miss Bennet?

644
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,718
- A little, ma'am, and very poorly.
- Do you draw?

645
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,996
No, not at all.

646
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,316
Your sisters, do they draw?

647
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,754
Not one.

648
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,353
That's very strange.

649
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,034
I suppose you had no opportunity.

650
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,954
Your mother should've taken you to town
for the benefit of the masters.

651
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,079
My mother wouldn't have minded,
but my father hates town.

652
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,516
- Has your governess left you?
- We never had a governess.

653
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,953
No governess? Five daughters
brought up at home without a governess?

654
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:00,079
I never heard such a thing. Your mother
must've been a slave to your education.

655
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,196
Not at all, Lady Catherine.

656
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,195
Your younger sisters,
are they out in society?

657
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,436
- Yes, ma'am, all.
- All?

658
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,478
What, all five out at once?
That's very odd.

659
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,235
And you second. The younger ones
out before the elders are married?

660
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,758
Your youngest sisters
must be very young.

661
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,558
Yes, my youngest is not 16.

662
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,516
But it would be hard on younger sisters

663
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,195
not to have their amusement
because the elder is still unmarried.

664
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,238
It would hardly encourage
sisterly affection.

665
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:38,155
Upon my word, you give your opinion
very decidedly for so young a person.

666
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,920
Pray, what is your age?

667
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,834
With three younger sisters grown up,
you can hardly expect me to own to it.

668
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,596
Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us.

669
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,916
- No, I beg you.
- For music is my delight.

670
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,275
In fact,
there are few people in England

671
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,194
who have more true enjoyment of music.

672
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,873
Or better natural taste.

673
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:15,158
If I had ever learnt,
I should've been a great proficient.

674
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,313
So would Anne,
if her health would've allowed her.

675
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:23,519
I'm not afflicted with false
modesty, when I say I play poorly...

676
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:27,275
Come, Lizzie, her Ladyship demands it.

677
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,357
How does Georgiana get along, Darcy?

678
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,836
- She plays very well.
- I hope she practises.

679
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,117
No excellence can be acquired
without constant practice.

680
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,635
I've told Mrs Collins this.

681
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:04,116
Though you have no instrument,
you're welcome to come to Rosings

682
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,158
and play on the pianoforte
in the housekeeper's room.

683
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:11,035
You'll be in nobody's way
in that part of the house.

684
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,875
You mean to frighten me
by coming in all your state to hear me.

685
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,794
But I won't be alarmed,
even if your sister does play so well.

686
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,714
I know that I cannot alarm you
even should I wish it.

687
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,674
What was my friend like
in Hertfordshire?

688
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,758
You really care to know?

689
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,997
Prepare yourself
for something very dreadful.

690
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,078
The first time I saw him,
he danced with nobody,

691
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,798
though gentlemen were scarce

692
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,639
and there was more than
one lady without a partner.

693
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:52,395
- I knew nobody beyond my own party.
- Nobody can be introduced at a ball.

694
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,194
Fitzwilliam, I need you.

695
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,995
I do not have the talent

696
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,397
of conversing easily
with people I have never met before.

697
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,315
Perhaps you should take
your aunt's advice and practise.

698
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,193
<i>Dear Jane...</i>

699
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,994
Mr Darcy.

700
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,993
Please, do be seated.

701
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,075
Mr and Mrs Collins
have gone to the village.

702
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,517
This is a charming house.

703
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,878
I believe my aunt did a great deal
to it when Mr Collins first arrived.

704
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,315
I believe so.

705
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:30,475
She could not have bestowed
her kindness on a more grateful subject.

706
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:41,757
- Shall I call for some tea?
- No, thank you.

707
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,313
Good day, Miss Elizabeth,
it's been a pleasure.

708
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,916
What on earth have you done
to poor Mr Darcy?

709
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,355
I have no idea.

710
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,114
Every mind must have some counsellor

711
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,795
to whom it may apply
for consolation in distress.

712
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:12,556
There are many conveniences which
others can supply and we cannot procure.

713
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,517
I have in view those objects

714
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,678
which are only
to be obtained through intercourse...

715
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:24,954
Forgive me, through the intercourse
of friendship or civility.

716
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:30,678
On such occasions, the proud man steps
forth to meet you not with cordiality,

717
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,476
but with the suspicion of one
who reconnoitres an enemy...

718
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:39,116
- How long do you plan to stay?
- As long as Darcy chooses.

719
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,397
- I am at his disposal.
- Everyone appears to be.

720
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,155
I wonder he does not marry and secure
a lasting convenience of that kind.

721
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,955
- She would be a lucky woman.
- Really?

722
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,118
Darcy is a most loyal companion.

723
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:56,596
He recently came to the
rescue of one of his friends.

724
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,113
What happened?

725
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,316
He saved him
from an imprudent marriage.

726
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,635
Who's the man?

727
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:10,595
His closest friend, Charles Bingley.

728
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,713
Did Mr Darcy give a reason
for this interference?

729
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,917
There were apparently
strong objections to the lady.

730
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,237
What kind of objections?
Her lack of fortune?

731
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,479
I think it was her family
that was considered unsuitable.

732
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,476
- So he separated them?
- I believe so. I know nothing else.

733
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,078
Miss Elizabeth.

734
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,754
I have struggled in vain
and can bear it no longer.

735
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,913
These past months have been a torment.
I came to Rosings only to see you.

736
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:13,117
I have fought against
judgement, my family's expectation,

737
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:16,039
the inferiority of your birth,
my rank.

738
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,714
I will put them aside
and ask you to end my agony.

739
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,917
- I don't understand.
- I love you.

740
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,235
Most ardently.

741
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:33,113
Please do me the honour
of accepting my hand.

742
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,234
Sir, I appreciate the struggle
you have been through,

743
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,874
and I am very sorry
to have caused you pain.

744
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,036
It was unconsciously done.

745
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,118
- Is this your reply?
- Yes, sir.

746
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,874
- Are you laughing at me?
- No.

747
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,155
Are you rejecting me?

748
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:55,673
I'm sure the feelings which hindered
your regard will help you overcome it.

749
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,877
Might I ask why with so little civility
I am thus repulsed?

750
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:04,074
I might enquire why you told me you
liked me against your better judgement?

751
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,435
If I was uncivil,
then that is some excuse.

752
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,478
- But you know I have other reasons.
- What reasons?

753
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:13,076
Do you think anything might tempt me
to accept the man who has ruined

754
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,277
the happiness of a most beloved sister?

755
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,956
Do you deny that you separated
a young couple who loved each other,

756
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,395
exposing your friend
to censure for caprice

757
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,279
and my sister to derision
for disappointed hopes,

758
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,396
involving them both in acute misery?

759
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,876
- I do not deny it.
- How could you do it?

760
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,793
I believed your sister
indifferent to him.

761
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,520
I realised his attachment
was deeper than hers.

762
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,635
She's shy!

763
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,354
Bingley was persuaded
she didn't feel strongly.

764
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,476
- You suggested it.
- For his own good.

765
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,359
My sister hardly shows
her true feelings to me.

766
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,834
I suppose his fortune
had some bearing?

767
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,474
I wouldn't do your sister the dishonour.

768
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,596
- It was suggested...
- What was?

769
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,115
It was clear an advantageous marriage...

770
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,555
- Did my sister give that impression?
- No!

771
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:06,673
- No. There was, however, your family...
- Our want of connection?

772
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,195
- No, it was more than that.
- How, sir?

773
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:14,076
The lack of propriety shown by your
mother, younger sisters and your father.

774
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:22,115
Forgive me. You and your sister
I must exclude from this.

775
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,158
And what about Mr Wickham?

776
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,275
Mr Wickham?

777
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:34,119
What excuse can you
give for your behaviour?

778
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,397
- You take an eager interest.
- He told me of his misfortunes.

779
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,120
- Oh, they have been great.
- You ruin his chances

780
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,396
yet treat him with sarcasm.

781
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,516
So this is your opinion of me?

782
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,996
Thank you. Perhaps these offences
might have been overlooked

783
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:52,278
had not your pride been hurt
by my scruples about our relationship.

784
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:55,517
I am to rejoice in the inferiority
of your circumstances?

785
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,240
And those are the words of a gentleman.

786
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:02,916
Your arrogance and conceit, your selfish
disdain for the feelings of others

787
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:08,598
made me realise you were the last man
in the world I could ever marry.

788
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,196
Forgive me, madam,
for taking up so much of your time.

789
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,236
I came to leave you this.

790
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,875
I shall not renew the sentiments
which were so disgusting to you.

791
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:43,153
But if I may, I will address the
two offences you have laid against me.

792
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,677
<i>My father loved Mr Wickham as a son.</i>

793
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,475
<i>He left him a generous living.
But upon my father's death,</i>

794
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:01,077
<i>Mr Wickham announced
he had no intention of taking orders.</i>

795
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:06,798
<i>He demanded the value of the living,
which he'd gambled away within weeks.</i>

796
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,077
<i>He then wrote,
demanding more money, which I refused.</i>

797
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:15,198
<i>After which,
he severed all acquaintance.</i>

798
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:19,598
<i>He came back to see us last summer, and
declared passionate love for my sister,</i>

799
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,514
<i>whom he tried to persuade
to elope with him.</i>

800
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:27,195
<i>She is to inherit 30,000.</i>

801
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:32,559
<i>When it was made clear he would never
receive a penny of it, he disappeared.</i>

802
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:36,235
<i>I will not attempt to convey the depth
of Georgiana's despair.</i>

803
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,398
<i>She was 15 years old.</i>

804
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,795
<i>As to the other matter,
of your sister and Mr Bingley,</i>

805
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,356
<i>though the motives which governed me
may appear insufficient,</i>

806
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,757
<i>they were in the service of a friend.</i>

807
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,876
Lizzie.

808
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,757
Are you all right?

809
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,157
I hardly know.

810
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,798
Lizzie. How fortunate you have arrived.

811
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,515
Your aunt and uncle are here
to deliver Jane from London.

812
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,877
- How is Jane?
- She's in the drawing room.

813
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:28,236
I'm quite over him. If he passed me
in the street, I'd hardly notice.

814
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:32,115
London is so diverting. It's true.

815
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,400
There's so much to entertain.

816
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,757
What news from Kent?

817
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,477
Nothing.

818
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,196
At least not much to entertain.

819
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,078
Lizzie, tell Mama!

820
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,840
Stop making such a fuss.

821
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,675
- Why didn't she ask me as well?
- Because I'm better company.

822
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,314
- What's the matter?
- I've just as much right.

823
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,596
Let's all go.

824
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:07,593
Lydia's been invited to Brighton
with the Forsters.

825
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,716
Sea-bathing would set me up nicely.

826
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:12,075
I shall dine with the officers
every night.

827
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,117
Papa, don't let her go.

828
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:18,836
Lydia will never be easy until she's
exposed herself in some public place.

829
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,357
And we could never expect her
to do it with so little inconvenience.

830
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,516
If you do not check her,

831
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:30,236
she'll be fixed as the silliest flirt
who ever made her family ridiculous.

832
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,158
And Kitty will follow, as always.

833
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:37,036
Lizzie, we shall have no peace
until she goes.

834
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,397
Is that really all you care about?

835
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,996
Colonel Forster is a sensible man.

836
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,873
He will keep her
out of any real mischief.

837
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,759
And she's too poor
to be an object of prey to anyone.

838
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,035
It's dangerous.

839
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:55,597
I am certain the officers will find
women better worth their while.

840
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,315
Let us hope, in fact,
that her stay in Brighton

841
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:05,116
will teach her her own insignificance.

842
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,834
At any rate,
she can hardly grow any worse.

843
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,357
If she does, we'd be obliged to
lock her up for the rest of her life.

844
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,754
Lizzie, you're welcome to accompany us.

845
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,797
The Peak District is not Brighton.

846
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,356
Officers are thin on the ground
which may influence your decision.

847
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,473
Come to the Peak District with us,
Lizzie, and get some fresh air.

848
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:37,076
The glories of nature. What are men
compared to rocks and mountains?

849
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,317
Men are either eaten up
with arrogance or stupidity.

850
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,677
If they are amiable,
they have no minds of their own.

851
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,997
Take care, my love.
That savours strongly of bitterness.

852
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:57,793
I saw Mr Darcy when I was at Rosings.

853
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,473
Why did you not tell me?

854
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,355
Did he mention Mr Bingley?

855
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,753
No.

856
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,275
No, he did not.

857
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,756
Oh, what are men
compared to rocks and mountains?

858
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,276
Or carriages that work?

859
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,434
Where exactly are we?

860
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,915
Quite close to Pemberley.

861
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,955
- Mr Darcy's home?
- That's the fellow.

862
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,635
Very well-stocked lake.
I've a hankering to see it.

863
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,835
Oh, no, let's not.

864
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,356
Well, he's so...

865
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,996
I'd rather not, he's so... he's so...

866
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,798
- So what?
- So rich.

867
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,997
By heavens, Lizzie,
what a snob you are!

868
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:57,755
Objecting to Mr Darcy because of his
wealth. The poor man can't help it.

869
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:03,159
He won't be there anyway.
These great men are never at home.

870
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,159
Keep up.

871
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:29,355
- Is your master much at home?
- Not as much as I would wish.

872
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,915
He dearly loves it here.

873
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:35,675
If he should marry,
you might see more of him.

874
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,633
He's a lot like his father.

875
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:55,198
When my husband was ill,
Mr Darcy couldn't do enough.

876
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,273
He just organised the servants for me.

877
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,995
This is he, Mr Darcy.

878
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,236
A handsome face.

879
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,475
Lizzie, is it a true likeness?

880
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:31,956
Does the young lady
know Mr Darcy?

881
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,315
Only a little.

882
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:38,433
Do you not think him
a handsome man, miss?

883
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,953
Yes.

884
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,556
Yes, I dare say he is.

885
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,758
This is his sister, Miss Georgiana.

886
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,715
She sings and plays all day long.

887
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,235
Is she at home?

888
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,279
Miss Elizabeth.

889
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:16,517
- I thought you were in London.
- No.

890
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:18,875
No, I'm not.

891
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,678
No.

892
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:24,037
- We would not have come...
- I came back a day early...

893
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,953
I'm with my aunt and uncle.

894
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,516
And are you having a pleasant trip?

895
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:38,194
Very pleasant.

896
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:41,716
- Tomorrow we go to Matlock.
- Tomorrow?

897
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,557
- Are you staying at Lambton?
- Yes, at the Rose and Crown.

898
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,716
Yes.

899
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,878
I'm so sorry to intrude.

900
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:57,959
They said the house was open
for visitors. I had no idea.

901
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,075
- May I see you back to the village?
- No.

902
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,875
- I'm very fond of walking.
- Yes.

903
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,478
Yes, I know.

904
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,395
Goodbye, Mr Darcy.

905
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,755
This way, sir.

906
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,556
Are you sure you
wouldn't like to join us?

907
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:03,476
We've just met Mr Darcy.
You didn't tell us that you'd seen him.

908
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:08,117
He's asked us to dine with him tomorrow.
He was very civil, was he not?

909
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,714
- Very civil.
- Not at all how you'd painted him.

910
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,194
To dine with him?

911
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:16,558
There's something pleasant
about his mouth when he speaks.

912
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,518
You don't mind delaying
our journey another day?

913
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:23,116
He particularly wants you
to meet his sister.

914
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,918
His sister.

915
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,276
Miss Elizabeth!

916
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,597
My sister, Miss Georgiana.

917
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,836
My brother has told me
so much about you,

918
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:05,918
- I feel as if we are friends already.
- Thank you.

919
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,277
- What a beautiful pianoforte.
- My brother gave it to me.

920
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:11,357
- He shouldn't have.
- I should have.

921
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,637
- Very well then.
- Easily persuaded, is she not?

922
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:18,518
He once had to put up with my playing.

923
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:23,196
- He says you play so well.
- Then he has perjured himself.

924
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,397
- I said "quite well".
- "Quite well" is not "very well".

925
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,198
I'm satisfied.

926
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,998
- Mr Gardiner, are you fond of fishing?
- Very much.

927
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,833
Would you accompany me
to the lake this afternoon?

928
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,434
Its occupants have been left
in peace too long.

929
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:46,639
- I would be delighted.
- Do you play duets, Miss Elizabeth?

930
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:51,794
- Only when forced.
- Brother, you must force her.

931
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,595
Splendid fishing, good
company. What a capital fellow.

932
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,638
Thank you so much, Mr Darcy.

933
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,596
A letter for you, madam.

934
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,557
Oh, it's from Jane.

935
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,116
It is the most dreadful news.

936
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,596
Lydia has run away...

937
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,078
...with Mr Wickham.

938
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,037
They are gone to Lord knows where.

939
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:46,957
She has no money, no connections.
I fear she is lost forever.

940
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,157
This is my fault.

941
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:55,716
If only I had exposed Wickham
when I should.

942
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:58,758
No, this is my fault.

943
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,077
I might have prevented all this
by being open with my sisters.

944
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,878
Has anything been done to recover her?

945
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:10,915
My father has gone to London,
but I know nothing can be done.

946
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,559
We have not the smallest hope.

947
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,517
Would I could help you.

948
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:19,796
Sir, I think it is too late.

949
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:27,234
This is grave indeed.
I will leave you. Goodbye.

950
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,277
We must go at once.

951
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:33,035
I will join Mr Bennet and find Lydia
before she ruins the family.

952
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:04,236
Why did the Forsters
let her out of their sight?

953
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:07,437
I always said they were unfit
to take charge of her.

954
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:10,757
- And now she is ruined.
- You are all ruined.

955
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:16,114
Who will take you now
with a fallen sister?

956
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:19,636
Poor Mr Bennet will now have
to fight the perfidious Wickham

957
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,319
and then be killed.

958
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,277
He hasn't found him yet, Mama.

959
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:26,153
Mr Collins will turn us out
before he is cold.

960
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:30,074
Do not be so alarmed. Our uncle
is in London helping in the search.

961
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:35,274
Lydia must know
what this must be doing to my nerves.

962
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:40,474
Such flutterings
and spasms all over me!

963
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:45,955
My baby Lydia, my baby!

964
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:50,472
How could she do such a thing
to her poor mama?

965
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:53,915
- You can't do that!
- Don't be such a baby.

966
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:56,680
- Kitty, give it to me.
- Who's it for?

967
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,398
It's addressed to Papa.

968
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,751
It's in Uncle's writing.

969
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:04,594
Papa, there's a letter.

970
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:08,036
- Let me catch my breath.
- It's in Uncle's writing.

971
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,516
- He's found them.
- Are they married?

972
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,035
- I can't make out his script.
- Give it to me.

973
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:18,434
Are they married?

974
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,957
They will be if Father settles 100
a year on her. That is his condition.

975
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,839
- You will agree to this, Father?
- Of course.

976
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,198
God knows how much your uncle
must've laid on that wretched man.

977
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,515
What do you mean?

978
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:33,477
No man would marry Lydia

979
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:37,673
under so slight
a temptation as 100 a year.

980
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,400
Your uncle must've been very generous.

981
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,555
Do you think it a large sum?

982
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:46,757
Wickham's a fool if he
accepts less than 10,000.

983
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,633
- Heaven forbid!
- Father!

984
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:55,478
Lydia married and at 15 too!

985
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,477
Ring the bell, Kitty.

986
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:01,958
I must put on my things and tell
Lady Lucas. Oh, to see her face.

987
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,754
Tell the servants
they will have a bowl of punch.

988
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:07,593
- We should thank our uncle.
- So he should help.

989
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,116
He's far richer than us
and has no children. Daughter married!

990
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,157
Is that really all you think about?

991
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:17,074
When you have five daughters, tell me
what else will occupy your thoughts.

992
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,998
Then perhaps you'll understand.

993
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,999
You don't know what he's like.

994
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,434
- Lydia!
- Oh, Mama!

995
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,317
We passed Sarah Sims in her carriage.

996
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:36,195
So I took off my glove
so she might see the ring.

997
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,198
Then I bowed and smiled
like anything...

998
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:43,797
I'm sure she was not
half as radiant as you, my dear.

999
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,996
You must all go to Brighton.

1000
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,636
That is the place to get husbands.
I hope you have half my good luck.

1001
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,239
Lydia.

1002
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:55,439
I want to hear
every little detail, Lydia, dear.

1003
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,478
I've been enlisted
in a regiment in the North of England.

1004
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,198
Glad to hear it.

1005
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:03,477
Near Newcastle.
We travel there next week.

1006
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:07,519
- Can I come and stay with you?
- That is out of the question.

1007
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:10,399
Monday morning came
and I was in such a fuss.

1008
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:11,675
I don't want to hear.

1009
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:15,276
There was my aunt preaching away
as if reading a sermon.

1010
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:18,995
- She was horrid unpleasant.
- Can't you understand why?

1011
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:23,273
But I didn't hear a word because
I was thinking of my dear Wickham.

1012
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,000
I longed to know if
he'd be married in his bluecoat.

1013
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:30,517
The North of England, I believe,
boasts some spectacular scenery.

1014
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:34,355
So I thought, who is to be
our best man if he doesn't come back?

1015
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,996
Lucky, he did,
or I would've had to ask Mr Darcy.

1016
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:42,358
- Mr Darcy!
- I forgot!

1017
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:45,796
- But I shouldn't have said a word.
- Mr Darcy was at your wedding?

1018
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,758
He was the one that discovered us.

1019
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:53,516
He paid for the wedding,
Wickham's commission, everything.

1020
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:55,517
But he told me not to tell.

1021
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,995
- Mr Darcy?
- Stop it, Lizzie.

1022
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:03,959
Mr Darcy's not half as high and mighty
as you sometimes.

1023
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:12,318
Kitty, have you seen my ring?

1024
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,556
Write to me often, my dear.

1025
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:17,718
Married women
never have much time for writing.

1026
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,677
I dare say you won't.

1027
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:24,635
When I married your father, there didn't
seem to be enough hours in the day.

1028
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:30,916
My sisters may write to me,
for they'll have nothing else to do.

1029
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,639
There's nothing so bad
as parting with one's children.

1030
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:46,275
One seems so forlorn without them.

1031
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:55,435
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Lydia. Goodbye, Mr Wickham.

1032
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,514
Bye, Kitty. Bye, Papa.

1033
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:08,237
I can't imagine what your
father does with all that ink.

1034
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:10,237
Mrs Bennet.

1035
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:15,796
Did you hear the news, madam?
Mr Bingley is returning to Netherfield.

1036
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:19,919
Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch
of pork. She expects him tomorrow.

1037
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,355
Tomorrow?

1038
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,994
Not that I care.
Mr Bingley's nothing to us.

1039
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:28,317
I'm sure I never want
to see him again, no.

1040
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:32,678
We shan't mention a word about it.
Is it quite certain he's coming?

1041
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:37,556
Yes, madam. I believe he's alone.
His sister remains in town.

1042
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:44,235
Why he thinks we should be interested,
I've no idea. Come along, girls.

1043
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:49,278
We better go home at once
and tell Mr Bennet.

1044
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:53,194
The impudence of the man.
I wonder he dare show his face.

1045
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,316
It's all right, Lizzie.

1046
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:58,358
I'm just glad he's alone
because we shall see less of him.

1047
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:02,638
Not that I'm afraid of myself.
But I dread other people's remarks.

1048
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,398
Oh, I'm sorry.

1049
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:39,515
He's here. He's here. He's at the door.

1050
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,558
- Mr Bingley!
- Mr Bingley?

1051
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:46,598
Oh, my goodness!
Everybody behave naturally.

1052
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:49,314
And whatever you do,
do not appear overbearing.

1053
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:52,916
There's someone with him.
Mr Whatsisname, the pompous one.

1054
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:57,557
Mr Darcy? The insolence of
it. What does he think of, coming here?

1055
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:02,436
Keep still, Jane. Mary, put that away at
once. Find some useful employment.

1056
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,275
Oh, my Lord, I shall have a seizure,
I'm sure I shall.

1057
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,317
Kitty.

1058
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:13,553
- We can't have this here.
- Mary, the ribbons, the ribbons.

1059
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:19,517
Mary, sit down at once. Mary!

1060
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:27,358
Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley, ma'am.

1061
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,354
How glad we are
to see you, Mr Bingley.

1062
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:43,080
There have been
many changes since you went away.

1063
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:47,995
Miss Lucas is married and settled.
And one of my own daughters too.

1064
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,957
You will have seen it in the papers,

1065
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,594
though it was not put in
as it ought to have been.

1066
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:56,315
Very short. Nothing about her family.

1067
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:59,199
Yes, I did hear of it.
I offer my congratulations.

1068
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,636
But it is very hard
to have my Lydia taken away from me.

1069
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:06,719
Mr Wickham has been transferred
to Newcastle, wherever that is.

1070
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:08,677
Will you stay long in the country?

1071
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,996
Just a few weeks. For the shooting.

1072
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:13,156
When you've killed all your own birds,

1073
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:16,278
I beg you will come here
and shoot as many as you please.

1074
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:20,797
Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige
and will save the best coveys for you.

1075
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,355
Excellent.

1076
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:27,274
- Are you well, Mr Darcy?
- Quite well, thank you.

1077
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,715
I hope the weather stays fine
for your sport.

1078
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:33,236
- I return to town tomorrow.
- So soon?

1079
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:39,197
My Jane looks well, does she not?

1080
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,996
She does indeed.

1081
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,719
Well, we must be going, I think.

1082
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:56,915
Darcy. It's been very pleasant
to see you all again.

1083
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:58,997
Miss Elizabeth. Miss Bennet.

1084
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,519
You must come again.

1085
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:04,036
Last winter, you promised to have
a family dinner with us.

1086
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:08,836
I've not forgot, you see.
At least three courses.

1087
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,038
Excuse me.

1088
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:24,359
Most extraordinary.

1089
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,276
We were going to walk in
and she was going to say, "Sit down."

1090
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,436
So, I feel...

1091
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,198
Oh, it's a disaster, isn't it?

1092
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,277
It's been...

1093
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,676
- Miss Bennet.
- Mr Bingley.

1094
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:01,553
I'll just go in and I'll just say it.

1095
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,915
Yes, exactly.

1096
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,995
I'm glad that's over. Now we can
meet as indifferent acquaintances.

1097
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:13,115
Oh, yes.

1098
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:16,278
You cannot think me so weak
as to be in danger now.

1099
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:20,155
You are in great danger of making
him as much in love with you as ever.

1100
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:26,237
- I'm sorry he came with Mr Darcy.
- Don't say that.

1101
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:28,555
Why ever not?

1102
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:34,238
Jane.

1103
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:39,076
- I've been so blind.
- What do you mean?

1104
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,919
Look, it's him.
He's back. He's come again.

1105
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,837
I know this is all very untoward,

1106
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:56,079
but I would like to request the
privilege of speaking to Miss Bennet.

1107
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:59,276
Alone.

1108
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,917
Everybody to the kitchen immediately.

1109
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:07,959
Except you, Jane, dear, of course.

1110
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:14,675
Oh, Mr Bingley, it's so good
to see you again so soon.

1111
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:38,516
First, I must tell you I've been the
most unmitigated and comprehensive ass.

1112
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:57,679
Kitty, be quiet.

1113
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:11,915
Yes.

1114
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:14,275
A thousand times yes.

1115
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:22,756
Thank the Lord for that.
I thought it would never happen.

1116
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:11,398
I am confident
they will do well together.

1117
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:15,394
Their tempers are much alike.

1118
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:20,194
They will be cheated assiduously
by their servants.

1119
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:26,316
And be so generous with the rest,
they will always exceed their income.

1120
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:30,877
Exceed their income?
He has 5,000 a year.

1121
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:38,036
I knew she did not be
so beautiful for nothing.

1122
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:48,435
"...must be free from all insincerity.

1123
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:52,115
She only can address herself effectually
to the feelings of others

1124
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:55,437
whose mind glows
with the warmth of sensibility

1125
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:58,279
and whose arguments result
from conviction.

1126
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:01,796
She must feel the influence
of those passions and emotions

1127
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,037
which she wishes to inspire..."

1128
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:27,155
Can you die of happiness?

1129
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:31,558
He was ignorant
of my being in town in the spring.

1130
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:34,678
- How did he account for it?
- He thought me indifferent.

1131
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:38,435
- Unfathomable.
- No doubt poisoned by his sister.

1132
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:43,958
Bravo. That's the most
unforgiving speech you've ever made.

1133
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:46,236
Oh, Lizzie, if I could
but see you so happy.

1134
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,635
If there was such a man for you.

1135
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:55,357
Perhaps Mr Collins has a cousin.

1136
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,797
- What is that?
- What?

1137
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:02,918
Maybe he's changed his mind.

1138
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:07,076
Coming!

1139
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:11,393
Yes.

1140
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:15,276
Lady Catherine.

1141
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:23,518
The rest of your offspring, I presume?

1142
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:27,275
All but one. The youngest
has been lately married, your Ladyship.

1143
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:30,273
My eldest was proposed to
only this afternoon.

1144
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:35,914
- You have a very small garden.
- Could I offer you a cup of tea?

1145
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:39,356
Absolutely not. I need to speak
to Miss Elizabeth Bennet alone.

1146
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:42,276
As a matter of urgency.

1147
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:49,277
You can be at no loss
to understand why I am here.

1148
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,635
I cannot account for this honour at all.

1149
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,879
I warn you, I am not to be trifled with.

1150
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:58,315
A most alarming report
has reached me.

1151
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:02,837
That you intend to be united
with my nephew, Mr Darcy.

1152
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,436
I know this to be a falsehood.
Though not wishing to injure him

1153
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:10,394
by supposing it possible, I instantly
set off to make my sentiments known.

1154
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,518
If you believed it impossible,
I wonder that you came so far.

1155
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:14,994
To hear it contradicted.

1156
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:18,436
Your coming will be a confirmation
if such a report exists.

1157
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:21,757
lf? You pretend to be ignorant of it?

1158
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,798
Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourself?

1159
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,757
I have never heard of it.

1160
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:29,235
Can you declare
there is no foundation for it?

1161
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:32,796
I do not pretend to possess
equal frankness with your Ladyship.

1162
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:35,918
You may ask a question
which I may choose not to answer.

1163
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:38,315
Has my nephew
made you an offer of marriage?

1164
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:41,438
Your Ladyship has declared it
to be impossible.

1165
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,036
Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter.
Now what have you to say?

1166
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:48,795
If that is the case, you cannot suppose
he would make an offer to me.

1167
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:53,875
Selfish girl. This union
has been planned since their infancy.

1168
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:57,277
Do you think it can be prevented
by a woman of inferior birth

1169
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:01,758
whose own sister's elopement resulted
in a scandalously patched-up marriage

1170
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:05,077
only achieved
at the expense of your uncle.

1171
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:08,994
Heaven and Earth! Are the shades
of Pemberley to be thus polluted?

1172
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:11,594
Tell me once and for all,
are you engaged to him?

1173
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:17,036
I am not.

1174
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:20,713
Will you promise never
to enter into such an engagement?

1175
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:22,996
I will not and I certainly never shall.

1176
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,995
You have insulted me
in every possible way

1177
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:29,839
and can now have
nothing further to say.

1178
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:33,674
I must ask you to leave immediately.

1179
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:37,154
Goodnight.

1180
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:42,675
I have never been thus treated
in my entire life!

1181
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:47,196
- What is going on?
- Just a small misunderstanding.

1182
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:50,477
For once in your life,
leave me alone!

1183
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:35,799
- I couldn't sleep.
- Nor I. My aunt...

1184
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:38,997
Yes, she was here.

1185
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:42,197
How can I ever make amends
for such behaviour?

1186
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:44,635
After what you've done for Lydia

1187
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:47,997
and, I suspect, for Jane,
it is I who should be making amends.

1188
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:53,876
You must know.
Surely you must know it was all for you.

1189
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:59,277
You are too generous to trifle with me.

1190
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:02,716
You spoke with my aunt last night
and it has taught me to hope

1191
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:05,474
as I'd scarcely allowed myself before.

1192
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:11,715
If your feelings are still what they
were last April, tell me so at once.

1193
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:14,758
My affections and wishes
have not changed.

1194
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:17,997
But one word from you
will silence me for ever.

1195
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:27,118
lf, however,
your feelings have changed...

1196
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:31,916
...I would have to tell you,

1197
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:34,839
you have bewitched me,
body and soul, and I love...

1198
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,958
I love... I love you.

1199
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:40,953
I never wish to be parted
from you from this day on.

1200
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,798
Well, then.

1201
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:01,080
Your hands are cold.

1202
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:45,477
Shut the door, please.

1203
01:51:55,960 --> 01:52:01,239
Lizzie, are you out of your senses?
I thought you hated the man.

1204
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:06,235
- No, Papa.
- He is rich, to be sure.

1205
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:10,115
And you will have
more fine carriages than Jane.

1206
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:12,635
But will that make you happy?

1207
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:16,753
Have you no other objection
than your belief in my indifference?

1208
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:19,036
None at all.

1209
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:23,876
We all know him to be
a proud, unpleasant sort of fellow.

1210
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:26,355
But this would be nothing
if you liked him.

1211
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:28,158
I do like him.

1212
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:31,959
I love him.

1213
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:39,476
He's not proud. I was wrong.
I was entirely wrong about him.

1214
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:45,917
You don't know him, Papa.
If I told you what he was really like,

1215
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:47,235
what he's done...

1216
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:50,156
What has he done?

1217
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:01,515
But she doesn't like him.
I thought she didn't like him.

1218
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:05,235
So did I. So did we all.

1219
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:07,994
We must have been wrong.

1220
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:13,473
- It won't be the first time, will it?
- No, nor the last, I dare say.

1221
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:20,478
Good Lord.

1222
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,879
- I must pay him back.
- No.

1223
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:30,476
You mustn't tell anyone.
He wouldn't want it.

1224
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:34,798
We misjudged him, Papa.
Me more than anyone. In every way.

1225
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,197
Not just in this matter.

1226
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:40,920
I've been nonsensical.

1227
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:45,835
But he's been a fool about Jane,
about so many other things.

1228
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:49,316
But then, so have I.

1229
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:54,759
You see, he and I are...

1230
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:59,957
He and I are so similar.

1231
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:03,357
We're both so stubborn.

1232
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:06,598
Papa, I...

1233
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,675
You really do love him, don't you?

1234
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:16,275
Very much.

1235
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:26,038
I cannot believe
that anyone can deserve you.

1236
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:30,239
But it seems I am overruled.

1237
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:34,837
So I heartily give my consent.

1238
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:47,556
I could not have parted with you,
my Lizzie, to anyone less worthy.

1239
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:51,715
Thank you.

1240
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:09,557
If any young men come for Mary or Kitty,
for heaven's sake, send them in.

1241
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:12,194
I'm quite at my leisure.
