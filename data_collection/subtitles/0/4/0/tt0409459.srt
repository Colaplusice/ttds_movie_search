00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:19,912
 Maybe.

173
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:23,349
 Maybe someone's picking off
 costumed heroes.

174
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,618
 DAN:
 You don't think that's a little paranoid?

175
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,421
 That what they say about me now?

176
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,856
 Paranoid?

177
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:32,859
 DAN: Look, Comedian made
 a lot of enemies over the years...

178
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,527
 ...even among his friends.

179
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:36,687
 RORSCHACH:
 Speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?

180
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:41,701
 He wrote that book. Said some bad things
 about the Comedian in it.

181
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:45,761
 I don't like what you're implying,
 and I like being followed even less.

182
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,943
 Maybe I was keeping an eye on you,
 in case someone's gunning for masks.

183
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:56,049
 -You were never that sentimental.
 -Attack on one is attack on all of
us.

184
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,482
 What do you suggest we do about it?

185
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:00,544
 Retribution.

186
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:05,425
 -Watchmen are over.
 -Says Tricky Dick.

187
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:07,187
 Says me.

188
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:11,597
 Nobody knows who you are.

189
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:14,734
 You can give it up,
 try and have a normal life.

190
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:18,635
 That what you have now?
 A normal life?

191
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:23,176
 When you walk down the street
 in a city dying of rabies...

192
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,811
 ...past the human cockroaches...

193
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:27,747
 ...talking about their heroin
 and child pornography...

194
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:29,270
 ...do you really feel normal?

195
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,179
 Least I'm not the one
 still hiding behind a mask.

196
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,315
 No.

197
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,116
 You're hiding in plain sight.

198
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:43,654
 Be seeing you, Dan.

199
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:46,799
 A maintenance hatch
 will let you out two blocks north.

200
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,701
 Yeah, I remember.

201
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,939
 Came here often,
 when we were partners.

202
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,838
 DAN: Those were great times, huh,
 Rorschach?

203
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:58,571
 -What happened?
 -You quit.

204
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:23,402
  Rorschach's journal. 

205
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,905
  First visit of evening fruitless. 

206
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,997
  Feel slightly depressed. 

207
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,610
  Soon there will be war. 

208
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:34,347
  Millions will perish 
 in sickness and misery. 

209
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:36,871
  Why does one death matter 
 against so many? 

210
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:42,588
  Because there is good and evil, 
 and evil must be punished. 

211
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,591
  Even in the face of armageddon... 

212
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,525
  ...I will not compromise in this. 

213
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,296
 MAN:
 Mr. Veidt...

214
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,598
 ...to date,
 you're one of only two Watchmen...

215
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:55,201
 ...ever to reveal their true identity
 to the world...

216
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,170
 ...the first being Hollis Mason.

217
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,339
 And you've certainly profited greatly
 by it...

218
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:05,778
 ...turning your superhero alter ego,
 Ozymandias, into a billion-dollar industry:

219
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:09,015
 Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering.

220
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:11,250
 I understand there's a movie
 in the works.

221
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,621
 -I'm not hearing a question, Mr. Roth.
 ROTH: I'm sorry. Do you think--

222
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,357
 The Watchmen resent me
 for prostituting their struggle?

223
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:21,260
 It's a fair question.
 Yes, it's crossed my mind...

224
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,463
 ...some of my old colleagues
 might see it that way...

225
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,633
 ...just as you're clearly aware
 that biased journalism...

226
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,226
 ...sells more magazines.

227
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,675
 The merchandising arm of Veidt Industries
 is funding our work with Dr. Manhattan.

228
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:38,778
 We recently expanded our research facility
 in Antarctica...

229
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:42,181
 ...in the hope of developing cheap,
 renewable sources of energy...

230
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:45,351
 ...that we might eliminate
 the world's reliance on fossil fuels.

231
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,954
 Now, it doesn't take
 a political scientist...

232
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:51,524
 ...to see that our Cold War
 with the Russians isn't ideological...

233
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:55,394
 ...it's based upon fear.
 Fear of not having enough.

234
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:59,265
 But if we make resources infinite...

235
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:01,534
 ...ah...

236
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,626
 ...we make war obsolete.

237
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,303
 I would hope the other Watchmen
 understand that...

238
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,168
 ...wherever they may be.

239
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,643
 Thanks for your time.

240
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,723
 -You look good, Adrian.
 -Dan.

241
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:25,952
 It's been too long.

242
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:31,753
 ADRIAN: So Rorschach thinks
 someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh?

243
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:34,467
 You think it's possible?

244
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:37,196
 Statistically, one murder
 doesn't equal a trend.

245
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:40,304
 Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.

246
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,306
 And so was the Comedian.
 He was practically a Nazi.

247
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,346
 You know that better than anyone.

248
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,715
 I'm not here because I miss him.

249
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,217
 It's occurred to Rorschach...

250
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:54,185
 ...that we're the only ones
 who know each other's identities.

251
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,779
 Actually, the whole world knows yours.

252
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,023
 That's why I'm warning you first.

253
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,619
 Thank you, Dan...

254
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:11,203
 ...but I fear there's something
 much more real to worry about...

255
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:13,796
 ...than Rorschach's mask killer.

256
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:20,012
 If the Russians do launch their nukes,
 can Jon really stop them?

257
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:23,816
 The Soviets have 51,000
 warheads stockpiled.

258
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:27,186
 Even if Jon stops 99 percent of them...

259
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:31,383
 ...the 1 percent that get through
 could still kill every living thing on Earth.

260
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,491
 Even Dr. Manhattan
 can't be everywhere at once.

261
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:56,549
  Rorschach's journal, 
 October 13th, 1985... 

262
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:58,880
  ...8:30 p.m. 

263
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:03,689
  Meeting with Dreiberg 
 left bad taste in mouth. 

264
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:07,749
  A flabby failure who sits 
 whimpering in his basement. 

265
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,064
  Why are so few of us left active... 

266
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:17,103
  ...healthy and without 
 personality disorders? 

267
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:20,506
  The first Nite Owl 
 runs an auto-repair shop. 

268
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:24,076
  The first Silk Spectre 
 is a bloated, aging whore... 

269
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:27,113
  ...dying in a California rest resort. 

270
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:29,882
  Dollar Bill got his cape stuck 
 in a revolving door... 

271
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,405
  ...where he got gunned down. 

272
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,787
  Silhouette, murdered... 

273
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:37,721
  ...a victim of her own indecent lifestyle. 

274
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,281
  Mothman's in an asylum in Maine. 

275
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:49,668
  Even Adrian Veidt, possible homosexual. 

276
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,338
  Must investigate further. 

277
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:55,101
  Only two names remain on my list. 

278
00:27:55,641 --> 00:28:00,913
  Both share private quarters 
 at Rockefeller Military Research Center. 

279
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:03,582
  I shall go to them. 

280
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:08,951
  I shall go tell the indestructible man 
 that someone plans to murder him. 

281
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:11,724
 JON:
 Good evening, Rorschach.

282
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:15,394
 RORSCHACH:
 Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here.

283
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:16,826
 JON:
 Yes...

284
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:20,232
 ...but you're going to leave disappointed.

285
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:24,136
 Rorschach. You shouldn't be here.
 You're a wanted man.

286
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:26,505
 RORSCHACH:
 Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

287
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,741
 I have a real name I've been using.

288
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:29,942
 Try it.

289
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,211
 Whatever you say, Laurie.

290
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,612
 What are you doing here?

291
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:36,115
 JON:
 The Comedian is dead.

292
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,551
 Rorschach wants me
 to look into my future...

293
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,187
 ...see if the killer is ever
 publicly identified.

294
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:44,280
 Already warned Dreiberg.
 Came to warn you too.

295
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:49,357
 Even if I wanted to help...

296
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:54,266
 ...my future is blocked
 by some kind of temporal interference.

297
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:58,504
 -I cannot see it clearly.
 -Interference? Caused by what?

298
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:01,904
 In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

299
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:06,912
 If the United States and Soviet Union
 engage in all-out war...

300
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:11,083
 ...the resulting blast wave would produce
 a sudden burst of tachyons...

301
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:16,042
 ...particles which travel backward
 through what you perceive as time...

302
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:20,021
 ...therefore obscuring my vision
 of the present.

303
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,394
 I must return to my work.

304
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:23,696
 RORSCHACH:
 Wait a minute.

305
00:29:23,696 --> 00:29:26,365
 What if that's why
 someone wants us out of the way?

306
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,767
 So we can't do anything to stop it?

307
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,769
 Goodbye, Rorschach.

308
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,205
 RORSCHACH: Took a lot of effort
 to get in here to see you.

309
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,535
 I'm not leaving--

310
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:38,139
 --till I've had my say.

311
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:48,754
 Seems like there's a lot of things
 you don't tell me these days.

312
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:51,924
 I didn't wanna worry you prematurely.

313
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:56,228
 If Adrian and I can solve the energy crisis,
 war may be averted.

314
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:58,286
 LAURIE:
 But you always say time is simultaneous.

315
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:02,034
 If that's true,
 then how can you change the future?

316
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:07,206
 If only you could perceive time as I do.

317
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:08,467
 Please let me show you.

318
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:19,552
 Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
 I was a hero, goddamn it!

319
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:22,788
 It's not my fault you got old.
 What do you have to complain about?

320
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:25,391
 I'm putting food on the table
 for you and your child.

321
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,327
 Call your friend Eddie.
 Maybe he can give you a better life.

322
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:32,798
 -It was a mistake. One time.
 -Man tries to rape you--

323
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,162
 Stop!

324
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:36,569
 Your mind goes to dark places...

325
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,900
 ...and you wonder
 why I keep the worst from you.

326
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,276
 -Say hello to Dan for me.
 -What?

327
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,844
 You wanna ask me
 to go to dinner with you...

328
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:54,711
 ...like we used to...

329
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,280
 ...but you won't.

330
00:30:58,057 --> 00:31:00,320
 You know I can't.

331
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:05,664
 So you'll call Dan...

332
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:08,200
 ...which is only natural.

333
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,793
 You deserve the comfort of an old friend.

334
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:46,627
 LAURIE:
 Dan Dreiberg's table.

335
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:11,558
 DAN: Did you know that
 he and H.J. Were--? I had no idea.

336
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:15,300
 You remember that crazy guy?
 What'd he call himself?

337
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,969
 Captain Carnage.

338
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:20,339
 Used to pretend he was a supervillain
