1
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,773
Best place we went to
since we've been here.

2
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,144
Definitely, man.

3
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:22,944
Way to go, buddy.
Brother.

4
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,315
You guys coming back to my
place? All right. Let's go.

5
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:30,949
Hey!

6
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:35,091
Aw shame, shame.
Closing down the beer garden.

7
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,827
Hundred-meter dash powered
by knackwurst and lager.

8
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,034
Where are you guys from?

9
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,098
What's your event?

10
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,939
They don't speak English,
man.

11
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,076
Let's help them over.
Come on. Up?

12
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,676
Here you go.

13
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,148
Let's go.
I got you. Come on.

14
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,919
Up. Yeah. All right?

15
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,290
You guys take care.
See you.

16
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,098
Take it easy.
See you.

17
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,103
You're taking
the grade tomorrow.

18
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,866
Watch yourself, man.

19
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,266
<i>I'm Jim McKay
speaking to you live...</i>

20
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,827
<i>at this moment,
from ABC headquarters...</i>

21
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,102
<i>just outside the Olympic
village in Munich, West Germany.</i>

22
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,167
<i>The peace of what have been
called the "serene Olympics"...</i>

23
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,772
<i>was shattered just before dawn
this morning, about 5.:00.</i>

24
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,444
<i>There is great uncertainty
about how many Israelis...</i>

25
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,783
<i>are being held hostage
in the apartment.</i>

26
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,653
<i>It now appears that Black September
has tossed a piece of paper...</i>

27
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,056
<i>out the window.
A list of demands.</i>

28
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,721
<i>They want what they call
"the Israeli war machine"...</i>

29
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:26,630
<i>to release 200 Arabs, which it
insists are political prisoners...</i>

30
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,964
<i>or the hostages
will be killed.</i>

31
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,360
<i>The terrorist communiqu ends
with an appeal...</i>

32
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,532
<i>for revolutionaries
of the world to unite.</i>

33
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,666
<i>McKAY: This is building
number 31. At this moment...</i>

34
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,574
<i>eight or nine terrified
living human beings...</i>

35
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,549
<i>are being held prisoner.</i>

36
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:48,145
<i>The demands have been many-
There's someone right now.</i>

37
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,753
<i>This certainly has to be
one of the guerrillas.</i>

38
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:54,089
<i>A man with a stocking mask
on his face. Weird.</i>

39
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,258
<i>What's going on inside
that head and that mind?</i>

40
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,231
<i>Just a short
while ago, there was...</i>

41
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,234
<i>another in this long series
of negotiations.</i>

42
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:06,830
<i>The spokesman for the group
came out, spoke, went back.</i>

43
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:10,604
<i>It seems to be a process
of speak and consultation.</i>

44
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,544
<i>McKAY: Does it mean it's all right?
Or does it mean it's all over?</i>

45
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,103
<i>Come and get us.</i>

46
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,844
<i>As Peter Jennings indicated,
the German army...</i>

47
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,376
<i>because of very
complicated laws...</i>

48
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,284
<i>would not be allowed
to participate.</i>

49
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:26,554
<i>And there you see an athlete
holding a canvas bag...</i>

50
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,651
<i>in which is obviously
a machine gun.</i>

51
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,560
<i>Peter Jennings, once again,
is stationed...</i>

52
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,928
<i>inside the Olympic village.
With the naked eye, Peter...</i>

53
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,398
<i>what do you see now?</i>

54
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:37,369
<i>Jim, there are
now a great many...</i>

55
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,964
<i>maybe a dozen already,
of those security men...</i>

56
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,271
<i>in athletic uniforms.</i>

57
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,755
Stop!

58
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,267
<i>It now appears that the siege
of the apartment building...</i>

59
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,428
<i>where the hostages are being
held has been called off...</i>

60
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,472
<i>and the German police
are retreating from the area.</i>

61
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,530
<i>Officials seem to have decided
to abandon their plans...</i>

62
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,769
<i>when the leader of the fedayeen
came out of the building...</i>

63
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,401
<i>and demanded
they call off the siege...</i>

64
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,036
<i>pointing out
that the entire operation...</i>

65
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,205
<i>was being watched
on a television set...</i>

66
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,337
<i>within the apartment.</i>

67
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,814
<i>Apparently, new demands have
been made to move the fedayeen...</i>

68
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,978
<i>and their hostages,
though it isn't yet known...</i>

69
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,520
<i>when or where
this might occur.</i>

70
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,680
<i>This is Peter.
Do you have something...</i>

71
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,554
<i>to report to us
from where you are?</i>

72
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,220
<i>This is Cosell.
I certainly do, Peter.</i>

73
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:38,355
<i>We have an immense flurry
of action here.</i>

74
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:42,926
<i>Suddenly, in the whole area between
building 20 and building 12...</i>

75
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,229
<i>they have been clearing
out cars.</i>

76
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:48,365
<i>Obviously wary of an assault
from the German police...</i>

77
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,955
<i>...within
five minutes.</i>

78
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,616
<i>What I'm hearing
from here is that...</i>

79
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:09,219
<i>they're heading to an airport
called Frstenfeldbruck.</i>

80
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:10,963
<i>...says the chopper
just landed...</i>

81
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,362
<i>at the back
of the Olympic village here.</i>

82
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,161
<i>Can you see gate number seven?</i>

83
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,998
<i>This is Vance Kolvig.
What I have seen are...</i>

84
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,834
<i>four hostages
in one helicopter...</i>

85
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:23,239
<i>and it looks like five hostages
in the first helicopter.</i>

86
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,210
<i>Yes, I just got back
a little while ago...</i>

87
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,337
<i>and it was obvious
that something...</i>

88
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:28,779
<i>quite serious
was going on out there.</i>

89
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,249
<i>Here we are, outside the
gates. There are armored cars...</i>

90
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:32,340
<i>police cars...</i>

91
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,919
<i>Police are pouring in through
the gates with lights flashing...</i>

92
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,253
<i>and here come some more. Five,
six, here comes another one.</i>

93
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,657
<i>Seven armored cars have gone
in through the gates now.</i>

94
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,422
<i>They're mounting
a major invasion.</i>

95
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,828
<i>The latest word we get
from the airport is that...</i>

96
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,128
<i>quote, "all hell has broken
loose out there. "</i>

97
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,585
<i>It's just arrived, Peter.
The bus has arrived...</i>

98
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,711
<i>to the helicopters.
We have reports now...</i>

99
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,450
<i>that all the hostages,
all nine hostages are safe.</i>

100
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:15,885
<i>We repeat, we have confirmed,
it's just past 1.:00 a. m.</i>

101
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,691
<i>The fighting ceased
at midnight.</i>

102
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,823
<i>Well, that's at least 24
we've seen go in...</i>

103
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,390
<i>and now we can see
the lights flashing...</i>

104
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:24,130
<i>There was a terrible battle at
the airport, but the hostages...</i>

105
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,729
<i>somehow the hostages are safe.</i>

106
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,331
<i>And, according to these
reports, all Arab terrorists...</i>

107
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,138
<i>have died by German gunfire.</i>

108
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:34,237
<i>Originally it was said
that the hostages were safe...</i>

109
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,407
<i>but now that has been changed.</i>

110
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,678
<i>An Olympic spokesman
said that...</i>

111
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,777
<i>CIOFFl: Of the areas in the
world, this is one of the areas...</i>

112
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,593
<i>They've spent their youth,
their young people...</i>

113
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,095
<i>they've spent all their money
on wars.</i>

114
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,893
<i>Now they have a chance to build
their nations. These nations...</i>

115
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,560
<i>And, of course, they're compatible.
The Arabs and the Israelis...</i>

116
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,466
<i>are perfectly compatible
as far as I can tell.</i>

117
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,368
<i>And now, as you say, Peter,
you're quite right.</i>

118
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,669
<i>They've been jolted apart
again, as they were...</i>

119
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,608
<i>seeming to come just a little
closer. Little hope.</i>

120
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,146
<i>We've just gotten the final
word. When I was a kid...</i>

121
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,807
<i>my father used to say our greatest
hopes and our worst fears...</i>

122
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,375
<i>are seldom realized. Our worst
fears have been realized tonight.</i>

123
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:16,286
<i>They've now said that
there were 11 hostages.</i>

124
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,847
<i>Two were killed
in their rooms...</i>

125
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,488
<i>yesterday morning.</i>

126
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,926
<i>Nine were killed
at the airport tonight.</i>

127
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,790
<i>They're all gone.</i>

128
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,127
<i>...before a quiet
crowd of 80,000.</i>

129
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,365
<i>After the ceremony,
the surviving team...</i>

130
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,431
<i>saw the coffins
of their fallen comrades...</i>

131
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,272
<i>loaded onto an airplane
to bring them home together.</i>

132
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,939
<i>Enormous crowds also gathered
on Dizengoff Street...</i>

133
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:44,415
<i>and in Jerusalem on the plaza
in front of the Knesset.</i>

134
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,212
<i>People are weeping,
tearing their clothes.</i>

135
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,983
<i>The funerals, which will be
held tomorrow in Jerusalem...</i>

136
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,957
<i>are expected to draw
tens of thousands of mourners.</i>

137
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,494
<i>These are the names of the
members of the Israeli team...</i>

138
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,894
<i>at the Munich Olympics,
who were held hostage...</i>

139
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:01,263

<i>...a very private, terrible grief

job. What's going to happen to me?

Well, they were just athletes.
They went to the Olympics.

168
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,334
Look what happened
to them.

169
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,334
What now?

170
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,172
Now we're going
to have a baby.

171
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,346
Eleven names.

172
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,975
Give us the order,
and we'll begin.

173
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,790
It's the same as Eichmann.

174
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,582
We say to these butchers:

175
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,525
"You didn't want
to share this world with us...

176
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,995
"then we don't have
to share this world with you. "

177
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,464
There's legitimacy for this.
Am I correct?

178
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,104
Ambushed
and slaughtered again...

179
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:53,534
while the rest of the world is
playing games, Olympic torches...

180
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,411
and brass bands
and dead Jews in Germany.

181
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,143
And the world
couldn't care less.

182
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,312
We've responded.
We sent 70 fighter jets.

183
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,547
A response no one heard.

184
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:05,182
Air strikes on guerrilla training
centers. That's a response.

185
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,192
No one notices what happens
in the border camps.

186
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,956
Sixty Arabs dead, at least.
Who knows how many wounded.

187
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,463
This is about fixing
the world's attention.

188
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:15,126
Well, it's not just
a publicity stunt.

189
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,928
Let me remind you.

190
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,363
Ali Hassan Salameh,
he invented Black September.

191
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,405
He is the architect
of the Munich murders.

192
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,136
These people.

193
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,108
They're sworn to destroy us.

194
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,450
Forget peace for now.

195
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,388
We have to show them
we're strong.

196
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,025
We have laws,
we represent civilization.

197
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,390
Some people say we can't
afford to be civilized.

198
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,796
I've always resisted
such people.

199
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,264
But I don't know
who these maniacs are...

200
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,327
and where they come from.

201
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,040
Palestinians?

202
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,442
They're not recognizable.

203
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,812
You tell me what law
protects people like these.

204
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,384
Today I'm hearing
with new ears.

205
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,458
Every civilization
finds it necessary...

206
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:17,257
to negotiate compromises
with its own values.

207
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,997
I've made a decision.

208
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,536
The responsibility
is entirely mine.

209
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,641
Avner?
Yes?

210
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,046
We're going to Jerusalem.
Get in.

211
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,442
Come on, sir.

212
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,158
Hello. I'm General Zamir.

213
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:52,589
Yes.

214
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,858
You swore us in.

215
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,196
My unit,
when I joined Mossad.

216
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,033
I don't remember you.

217
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,434
Of course, I know your father.

218
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,679
Avner.

219
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,683
It's been... Two years
since I worked for you.

220
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,417
I remember.
Please, sit down.

221
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:23,990
Harari.

222
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,321
General Nadav.

223
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,727
And General Yariv.

224
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,765
How are you?
How is your father?

225
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,601
He's fine. Thank you.

226
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,668
Coffee? It's wonderful
to see you again.

227
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:39,870
Sit.

228
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,076
The chief of the Mossad,
two generals...

229
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,915
and the Prime Minister.
Obviously, it's important.

230
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,455
This is something new.

231
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,093
What happened in Munich
changes everything.

232
00:14:57,664 --> 00:15:00,929
We want to ask you. Will
you undertake a mission?

233
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:04,865
An important mission. You will
have to leave the country...

234
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,236
and your family,
maybe for years.

235
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:10,242
And it is dangerous. You
can't talk about it to anyone.

236
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,937
Not even your wife.

237
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,944
Now you should
say something.

238
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,078
Do you have any questions?

239
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,523
So, this isn't about guarding
tourists on El Al jets?

240
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,629
No questions?

241
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,565
Did we mention
how dangerous it is?

242
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,568
You know, my sister
died on Tuesday.

243
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,234
No, I didn't know that.
Cancer.

244
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,007
I couldn't go to the
athletes' funerals...

245
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,600
because she died.

246
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,009
That upset people,
but she was my sister.

247
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,074
Family matters.

248
00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:00,150
Your wife is pregnant.
Yes, seven months.

249
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,420
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

250
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,559
You were one
of my favorite bodyguards.

251
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,326
You know,
I like neat, durable men.

252
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,664
You liked having
the son of a hero around.

253
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,305
Truth be told, you don't
look much like your father.

254
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,501
No?

255
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,976
Your mother
is who you resemble.

256
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,493
Tomorrow morning.

257
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,401
If you can't decide
in one day...

258
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,863
you can't decide.

259
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,214
Her sister died.

260
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,878
But I think she didn't go
to the athletes' funerals...

261
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,648
because some people
are angry at her...

262
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,316
for not negotiating
with the terrorists.

263
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,622
She didn't go
to the funerals...

264
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,930
because she didn't
want to be booed.

265
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:19,369
It's a good sign
you didn't ask questions.

266
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,838
You'll say yes.

267
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:24,104
I'm your case officer.
My name is Ephraim.

268
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:53,636
How late in the pregnancy before
you have to stop having sex?

269
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,202
Labor.

270
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,021
Don't worry about it.
You won't be around.

271
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,123
Will you?

272
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,224
Whatever they want, make
sure they give you a raise.

273
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,360
I need things for the baby.

274
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,899
I can't live
with refusing this.

275
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,605
Your mother,
she knew what she was doing.

276
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,839
She abandoned you on that
kibbutz. She didn't abandon me.

277
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,381
My father was missing.

278
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,781
He was in prison,
she was overwhelmed.

279
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,649
Oh, yes. She did what anybody would do.

280
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:45,120
Yeah, so she took you to the
kibbutz and abandoned you.

281
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,483
Now you think Israel
is your mother.

282
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,799
So listen.

283
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,929
I'm going to go along
with this, until I don't.

284
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,242
Do you understand me?
I love you.

285
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,775
I'm not the hero's nice wife.

286
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:21,086
First you resign from Mossad.
Your new contract.

287
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,287
It says we do not employ you,
offer you benefits, or pensions...

288
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,855
or legal aid
or medical assistance.

289
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,898
It's a contract
that there is no contract.

290
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,571
Do I get a copy?
You don't.

291
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,971
Your pension contribution
refund.

292
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,702
You're now officially
unofficial.

293
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,746
Unemployed and uninsured.

294
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,872
You'll open two accounts...

295
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,248
at the Union de Banques Suisse
in Geneva...

296
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,809
on Rue du Commerce.

297
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:51,414
Operational funds in one box,
in the other your salary...

298
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,685
which you don't take
till the mission ends...

299
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,454
when you get what accumulates.

300
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,361
Also, for each of your men, you
open an account for his salary.

301
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:02,424
How many men do I have for this
- In the operational funds box...

302
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:06,301
we will deposit
250,000 American dollars.

303
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,603
You take it out,
we put more in.

304
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,937
I want receipts.

305
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,236
You are not working
for the Baron Rothschild.

306
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,611
You're working for Israel,
a small country.

307
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:20,209
I'm an old Galicianer
from a mud hut in the Ukraine.

308
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,880
And I don't trust Yekke putzes
let loose in Europe...

309
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,116
with unlimited operational
expenses.

310
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:27,659
I was born in Israel.
I'm not a Yekke.

311
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,389
Where is your grandpa from?
Frankfurt.

312
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,455
You're a Yekke.

313
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:36,826
Your wife receives monthly
$1,000 in her bank account.

314
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,661
Also, we leave messages in the
box with the operational funds.

315
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,568
You can leave messages
for us.

316
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:47,407
But there shouldn't be messages.
I don't care about that.

317
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:51,711
Bring me receipts,
you got me? I got you.

318
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:55,918
Whatever you are doing,
somebody else is paying for it.

319
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,458
We have 11 Palestinian
names.

320
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,552
Each had a hand
in planning Munich.

321
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,462
You're going to kill them,
11 men, one by one.

322
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:07,794
They're all in Europe now.

323
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,334
You'll stay there
as long as it takes.

324
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:12,496
Europe only, not the Arab
countries. That's for us, not you.

325
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,732
And not Eastern Bloc.
Don't upset the Russians.

326
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,240
Who needs it?

327
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,574
You'll have no contact
with us.

328
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,470
You're not going to give me
any information?

329
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,982
We deposit money from a
fund that doesn't exist...

330
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:28,111
into a box we don't know about,
in a bank we never set foot in.

331
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,747
We can't help you because
we never heard of you before.

332
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,518
You'll do what
the terrorists do.

333
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,856
You think they report back
to home base? They don't.

334
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,087
We want them dead.

335
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:41,399
Nothing better than eating
something sweet by the sea.

336
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,367
You can ask questions now.

337
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,404
Am I alone?
Four others.

338
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:48,572
They know useful things
like cars, documents...

339
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,903
cleanup to make sure
you don't...

340
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,135
accidentally
drop your fake passport...

341
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,077
next to the dead body.
You're the team leader.

342
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,412
Who kills the targets?
You do. Who else?

343
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,153
Use guns if you have to,
but the bombs are preferable.

344
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,280
One of your guys
knows how to make them.

345
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:07,656
<i>We want everyone to read in Le Monde
some famous Arab terrorist is dead.</i>

346
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,319
Who knows who blew him up?

347
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:11,829
Why me?
So what's wrong with you?

348
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,758
I'm not an experienced
field operative.

349
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,232
So I'm not known.
Not even I know you now.

350
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:20,968
And also, I lived in Frankfurt
when I was a kid...

351
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,338
so I'm a Yekke Jew who
knows his way around Europe.

352
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:26,674
That's a good reason. Here's
one more. You're ordinary.

353
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:28,771
You aren't a sabra
Charles Bronson.

354
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,577
I am a sabra.
I know.

355
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,049
I know so much about you.
You're a nice sabra...

356
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,145
with a dog and a baby on the way.
You won't shoot Spanish bellhops.

357
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,213
No bellhops. No civilians.

358
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,622
That kind of trouble
we can't afford.

359
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,093
The hard thing will
not be finding them.

360
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:45,187
Some of them, anyway,
are not so carefully hidden.

361
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:47,698
The hard thing will be
not punishing yourselves...

362
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:50,133
by getting caught
or getting killed.

363
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,864
You want the last piece of baklava? No.

364
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,099
Smart decision.
You should avoid sweets.

365
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:58,507
After all, you just signed
away your dental insurance.

366
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,937
<i>This is Pierre Bouchet,
your captain, speaking.</i>

367
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:06,610
<i>Welcome aboard Flight SA 74
direct to Geneva.</i>

368
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,984
<i>We are now at a cruising
altitude of 30,000 feet...</i>

369
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,455
<i>and we wish you
a pleasant flight.</i>

370
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,503
Don't shoot. I don't
understand what you're saying.

371
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,930
Easy, easy, easy.

372
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,008
Press the buzzer
when you're done.

373
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,726
Have a nice day.
Thank you.

374
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,967
I'm not good at it.
No.

375
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,406
Hebrew?
No.

376
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:52,603
A team leader who cooks.
What a luxury.

377
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,976
Years in the kibbutz kitchen.
You've done this before?

378
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,344
Done what?

379
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,040
Sit. Come on.

380
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:02,349
Because I joined Mossad
10 minutes ago, and I'm...

381
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:07,151
Look, I want to kill every
one of these pigs, but...

382
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,421
Thank you.

383
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:12,191
So, some of you have training
in this kind of...

384
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:14,357
He sells antiques.
Right here in Frankfurt.

385
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,230
It's a front,
but successful.

386
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,292
I'm a documents
and identities specialist...

387
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,032
with a sharp eye
for early Danish Modern.

388
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,101
And you?

389
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,368
Oh, I make toys.

390
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,738
I thought you made bombs.
Toys, in Brussels.

391
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,441
For bombs,
I had to go to night school.

392
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:33,715
My wife's expecting.

393
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:35,447
<i>Mazel tov.
Mazel tov.</i>

394
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:38,046
Beautiful. When?
Couple of months.

395
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:41,151
Think we'll be done
by then?

396
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,251
Is it Ali Hassan Salameh
we're after?

397
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:48,795
I mean, that's the job,
right?

398
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:52,795
We're here to kill the guy
who planned Munich. Am I right?

399
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:59,501
It's strange, isn't it, to
think of oneself as an assassin?

400
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:02,012
Think of yourself
as something else then.

401
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:06,541
A soldier in a war. I mean,
you know how to shoot...

402
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:10,215
to assassinate people, right?

403
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:13,018
<i>Mazels on the baby,
and all that. That's great.</i>

404
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:15,424
That's just fantastic.
But, I mean...

405
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,260
You make dolls
in a toy shop...

406
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,428
and you shop for sofas...

407
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,598
and you,
I don't know what you do.

408
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:27,866
Me? I worry.

409
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,141
So, why'd they make you
team leader?

410
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,838
Because he really knows
how to cook a brisket.

411
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,734
<i>Hello?
Andreas.</i>

412
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,405
<i>Surprised? Surprised? You punched me.</i>

413
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,468
<i>You broke my jaw, man.
That was 10 years ago.</i>

414
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:09,741
<i>And you were sleeping
with my girlfriend.</i>

415
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:11,749
<i>Listen, I'm in town.
Are you around?</i>

416
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:13,648
<i>Yeah, actually, I'm
here with my girlfriend.</i>

417
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:16,153
<i>Do you want to come over?
Perfect.</i>

418
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,543
She's incredible,
isn't she?

419
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,315
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

420
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,754
I miss you, man. We really
used to love each other.

421
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,989
That was a long time ago.
We were in high school.

422
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,328
I have some names.

423
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,929
Some people I need to find
for my rich American friends.

424
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,374
Give me my money,
Yvonne.

425
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,547
One hundred fifty.
One hundred.

426
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,109
Cash.

427
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,979
$100,000.

428
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:01,285
These people I'm looking for,
you don't know them.

429
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,627
We might.
You don't.

430
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,099
But maybe you know someone
who does.

431
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,534
And it's Americans
you work for?

432
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,767
Yes. See?

433
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:15,963
James Madison.

434
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,603
Americans.

435
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,840
We'll ask some friends.

436
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,244
Hiding?
The Arabs are not hiding.

437
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,682
Munich was a big success for them. Oh?

438
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,581
The implications of Munich
for the struggle-

439
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:32,681
They got everyone's attention.
They're recruiting, making plans.

440
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,886
Give me a few names.

441
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,695
I can't help if I don't know
who you're trying to find.

442
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,530
We'll have to trust.

443
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,694
You have to cross the line.

444
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:49,963
I trust you. You carry cash
and you don't make speeches.

445
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,942
Nowadays, everyone makes
speeches, like your friend Andreas.

446
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,638
Talk, talk, talk.

447
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:56,971
Name me an Arab.

448
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,384
Abu Daoud.

449
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,185
Abu Youssef.

450
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,189
Wael Zwaiter.

451
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,658
Kamal Nasser.

452
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,664
Salameh.
Forget Salameh. Too hard.

453
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:15,598
Wait. Who are these guys? Why
are you trying to find Arabs?

454
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,192
Sixty thousand per name.
Dollars.

455
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:21,935
If it's good information. If
it isn't good, it doesn't cost.

456
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:24,604
Wael Zwaiter's here,
in Rome.

457
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,643
<i>He just translated the
Arabian Nights into Italian.</i>

458
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:31,975
Tomorrow there's a reading.
He's broke.

459
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,809
He has a niece he calls
every day in Damascus.

460
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,150
Are you trying
to join the PLO?

461
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,690
We need to talk. Alone.

462
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:44,457
And also maybe you need people
to help with your work.

463
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,860
Cars. Vans.

464
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:02,444
If you tell anybody
about this, I don't know.

465
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,013
Just don't.

466
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:06,948
Just don't.

467
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:27,571
Anything you need,
we'll provide.

468
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,830
I need receipts.

469
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,984
Keep talking. Keep talking.

470
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,478
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

471
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,267
Are you Wael Zwaiter?

472
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,703
Yes, and who are you?

473
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,271
Do you know
why we're here?

474
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:45,016
Are you Wael Zwaiter?
He said yes already.

475
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,751
He already said yes.

476
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:50,951
What are we doing?

477
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,867
What do I do?

478
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,266
Do you know why we're here?

479
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,216
What happened?
Why didn't you shoot him?

480
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,850
We shot him.
But I didn't hear a shot.

481
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,792
We shot him eight times,
maybe 10 times.

482
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,524
Did you kill him?
He's dead.

483
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:28,395
He shit his pants.
He's dead.

484
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,875
Drink some wine.
We're celebrating.

485
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,985
That old Pesach story.

486
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,411
The angels are rejoicing...

487
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:27,981
because the Egyptians have
just drowned in the Red Sea.

488
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:31,620
I didn't say we're rejoicing.

489
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,857
I said, "We're celebrating. "

490
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,592
And God said to the angels,
"Why are you celebrating?

491
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:39,228
"I've just killed
a multitude of my children. "

492
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:40,794
Mr. Zwaiter.

493
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:46,499
He cost us, by my
calculations, roughly $352,000.

494
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,108
You didn't finish the story.

495
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,408
The angels respond to God.

496
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,480
They say,
"God, we're celebrating...

497
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:58,181
"because when the people hear
what happened to the Egyptians...

498
00:40:58,256 --> 00:40:59,780
"they'll understand
your point. "

499
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:01,189
Which was?

500
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,185
Don't fuck with the Jews.

501
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,388
I don't know about the rest of
you, but I'm not celebrating.

502
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,331
I'm goddamn rejoicing.

503
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:13,597
Here. Put that down.
Put it down. Get up.

504
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,298
No, please.
Come on, dance with me.

505
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:17,534
Dance with me. Come on.
No.

506
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,071
Come on.

507
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,679
Come on. Hey.

508
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:58,446
This is...
What shall I call you today?

509
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:00,907
Franz Storsch.

510
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:04,554
You can call me Louis.

511
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,593
Our service has been
satisfactory? Pricey.

512
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:16,425
A Jew and a Frenchman. We
could haggle forever, huh?

513
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:20,062
I'm not a Jew. What do
you suppose a ramson is?

514
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:24,239
It's a kind of a wild leek. Not
in season, but garlic will do.

515
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:27,909
My papa sometimes loses
track of the seasons.

516
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:30,004
I know nothing about food.

517
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:32,673
Why does he make me shop?

518
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:38,914
You're wondering
if I'm French Intelligence.

519
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,890
Or CIA or KGB.

520
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,750
Or an agent with a profitable
sideline in information.

521
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:48,022
I could be anybody.
You could be anybody, too.

522
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,958
Identity.
That's the boring part now.

523
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:54,595
Here's what isn't boring.

524
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,567
As long as you don't work
for any government-

525
00:42:57,642 --> 00:43:00,406
I'm in private business.
Rich Americans, I heard.

526
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,207
I'm in private business, too.
My family.

527
00:43:03,715 --> 00:43:08,209
We can locate almost anyone
for anyone anywhere...

528
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:11,011
and we are ideologically
promiscuous.

529
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:13,419
We love everybody,
hate everybody.

530
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:15,584
I get my feelings confused.

531
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:18,257
If you're not working
for any government...

532
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,194
we know, or we find...

533
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,494
we don't find, you don't pay.

534
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,900
<i>Initially it was the
intention of the hijackers...</i>

535
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,371
<i>to bring the Lufthansa to
Munich International Airport...</i>

536
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,635
<i>and then take onboard
the three prisoners...</i>

537
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:34,974
<i>at the end of the runway, where
Captain Klausen took his plane...</i>

538
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:37,606
<i>while an Arab held
a hand grenade at his head.</i>

539
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:39,081
Hey, Avner.

540
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,880
A Lufthansa jet was hijacked
coming from Damascus.

541
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:44,420
The hijackers demanded the
release of three killers...

542
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:45,649
who survived Munich...

543
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,021
and the Germans said yes,
instantly.

544
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:51,289
<i>The Arabs would be flown by
private charter plane to Zagreb.</i>

545
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,296
Look.
They're free now.

546
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,130
They're in Libya.

547
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:05,435
No qualms about rejoicing
on their side, eh?

548
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:09,840
<i>The Israeli kills the Arabs...</i>

549
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,781
<i>in Egypt, in Jordan,
in Lebanon, in Syria-</i>

550
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,318
Look at them.

551
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:18,217
They're movie stars.

552
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:21,982
<i>But did you shoot any
of the Israeli hostages?</i>

553
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:27,664
<i>It's not important to say
if I killed Israelis or not.</i>

554
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:29,767
We should go to Tripoli.

555
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,331
Kill them.

556
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:33,230
We don't go
to Arab countries.

557
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:35,964
We stick to the names
we've been given.

558
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,236
Mahmoud Hamshari.

559
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:49,010
<i>Do you think,
looking back on it now...</i>

560
00:44:49,087 --> 00:44:51,715
<i>that you achieved anything
in the Munich operation?</i>

561
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:56,783
<i>We have made our voice heard
by the world.</i>

562
00:44:57,095 --> 00:44:58,756
<i>Are those your words?</i>

563
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:03,730
<i>The same thing again.</i>

564
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:07,931
<i>They have made their voice heard
by the universe or the world...</i>

565
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,973
<i>who has not been hearing
before.</i>

566
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:16,002
Well, I believe what
he meant by this is...

567
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,810
that now the world
will begin hearing us.

568
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:24,980
We are, for 24 years, the world's
largest refugee population.

569
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,149
Our homes taken from us.

570
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:30,991
Living in camps,
no future, no food.

571
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,394
Nothing decent
for our children.

572
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:37,091
And, so was the attack
in Munich justified?

573
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,904
The PLO condemns
attacks on civilians.

574
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:43,964
Though for 24 years...
Tell your newspaper that.

575
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:47,841
...our civilians have been attacked
by the Israelis day after day-

576
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,881
Tell them about all the years
and years of Palestinian blood...

577
00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:53,314
spilled by Israel.
And who mourns for us?

578
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:55,352
You know,
Israel just bombed...

579
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,887
two refugee camps
in Syria and Lebanon.

580
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:00,514
Tell them that-
200 people killed.

581
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:03,990
Right after Munich they did
this. It did not begin in Munich.

582
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,962
And where does it end?
How will it ever end?

583
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,407
I'm sorry, I need to use your
phone. I need to call my editor.

584
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,072
Yes, yes. Sorry.

585
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:27,876
You see it. It's by
the window. Thank you.

586
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,613
This way, please.

587
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:34,501
This man, we don't know
what he did specifically?

588
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:37,877
Hamshari arranged the attempted
assassination of Ben-Gurion...

589
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:39,678
in Copenhagen
a few years ago.

590
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,513
Now he organizes
for Fatah in France.

591
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,813
He organizes?
Yes.

592
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:44,718
In Tel Aviv they showed you
evidence for this?

593
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:46,279
Not evidence.
It was more...

594
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:48,188
this is the story
and I believe them.

595
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,783
Why? Don't you?

596
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,761
It's a crisis, a war.
You don't have to always...

597
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,993
What? Be thinking?
Scrutinize. Yeah, think.

598
00:48:56,067 --> 00:48:58,627
You want to wire Ephraim and
ask for evidence, you do it.

599
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:00,432
You're on your own.

600
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:02,968
Okay, I'm done.
Good.

601
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,871
Don't think about it.

602
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,536
Okay.

603
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:11,541
So, now, I turn it on.

604
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:16,178
He picks up the phone,
turns on the red light...

605
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:20,247
then I take out the key,
insert it...

606
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:22,053
and turn.

607
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,283
So now we wait
for the red light.

608
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:58,555
Is the truck blocking the signal? No.

609
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:00,715
Will the remote still work?

610
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,209
Yeah, it's a powerful transmitter.
Go back to your position.

611
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:22,905
You can't start improvising
now. Go back to your corner.

612
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,312
Don't worry. It's okay.
It's going to work.

613
00:52:55,306 --> 00:52:56,830
Stop!
Stop!

614
00:52:58,409 --> 00:52:59,706
Abort.

615
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,483
Are we on or off?

616
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:06,973
<i>Mahmoud Hamshari?
Yes.</i>

617
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:24,019
He's at the hospital Cochin.

618
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:27,323
I don't know how badly we
hurt him. They aren't saying.

619
00:54:27,398 --> 00:54:29,127
Why did you put a firecracker
in that phone?

620
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,064
Because I didn't want
to blow up the building.

621
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:33,626
What do you want from me?
An Arab corpse.

622
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:37,071
Another $200,000, more or less,
to eliminate target number two.

623
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:39,666
Yeah, if he's been eliminated.
We should stick with guns.

624
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,711
No one notices a shooting.

625
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,303
Bombs achieve
a double objective.

626
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,008
They eliminate targets
and they terrify terrorists.

627
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:48,517
That only works
when the bombs work.

628
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:49,779
Lunch?

629
00:54:57,494 --> 00:55:00,429
<i>The Israeli embassy in London
was rocked by a letter bomb...</i>

630
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:02,590
<i>shortly after 9.:30
this morning.</i>

631
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:05,100
<i>Dr. Ami Shachori was opening
his morning mail...</i>

632
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:08,297
<i>when the envelope exploded,
killing him instantly.</i>

633
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:12,603
They discovered seven in a mailroom
near the embassy in Earls Court.

634
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:15,871
<i>I guess they missed one.
Right after Hanukkah.</i>

635
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,707
I guess there was a big pileup
of mail and they got careless.

636
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:23,083
They found other letters
in Israel, of course.

637
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:27,146
Canada, Argentina, Vienna,
Kinshasa, Paris, Brussels.

638
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:30,488
Dozens of them, mainly posted
in the Netherlands.

639
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:32,561
It's all Black September.

640
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,961
It's a response, then.

641
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:36,799
To Hamshari.

642
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:38,492
And to Zwaiter.

643
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:42,004
They're talking to us.
We're in dialogue now.

644
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,907
Where are you?

645
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:48,744
I'm in New York,
following a lead.

646
00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:50,805
I'll call again.

647
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,057
Are you going
to visit your father?

648
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:08,089
Why is this taking
so long?

649
00:56:08,232 --> 00:56:09,722
It isn't fast.

650
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,765
We have the best hospitals
in the world.

651
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,734
When you were born, your father
was elsewhere. I was alone.

652
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:20,569
He was in prison.

653
00:56:23,147 --> 00:56:24,876
Should you be here?

654
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:27,011
Aren't you on duty?

655
00:56:27,618 --> 00:56:30,143
What are you going to do?
Turn me in?

656
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:33,286
How is he?

657
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:36,353
I don't visit
your father so much.

658
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:38,987
Wilma lets him yell at her
all the time.

659
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,723
She depresses me.

660
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,635
How are you?

661
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,736
I'm managing.
Don't worry about me.

662
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:58,445
I'm proud
of what you are doing.

663
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:01,246
You don't know
what I'm doing.

664
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:15,388
I look at you and I know
everything I need to know.

665
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:20,093
She is frighteningly
ugly.

666
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,668
She takes after you.

667
00:57:23,707 --> 00:57:26,005
I want you to move,
for a time.

668
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,701
I've arranged a place for us
in Brooklyn.

669
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,009
I can't come back to Israel.
I don't know how long for-

670
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,207
New York?

671
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,376
I can see more of you
this way. New York City?

672
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:41,322
But I have my family here,
and your parents.

673
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:45,020
You want my parents
to help raise her?

674
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:47,320
Look what they did to me.

675
00:57:48,532 --> 00:57:51,558
Don't you want your daughter
to be an Israeli, Avner?

676
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,197
She'll always be an Israeli.

677
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:58,507
Not in Brooklyn. She'll
just be another homeless Jew.

678
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:01,009
I can't do what I'm doing
if I can't see you.

679
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:02,807
What are you doing?

680
00:58:04,615 --> 00:58:07,413
Don't do it then, Avner.
This is our home.

681
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:10,350
You're the only home
I ever had.

682
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:12,313
What?

683
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:15,651
This is so corny.

684
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:18,126
It wasn't easy for
me to say that. I bet.

685
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:20,356
Don't laugh at me then.

686
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:23,194
Why did I have to marry
a sentimentalist?

687
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:25,167
You're ruining my life.

688
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:27,560
Your mother's teasing me.

689
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:43,318
Look at the waistline bulge
on that guy.

690
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:46,382
Look at that.
Think he might be armed, eh?

691
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,653
As are the Russians.

692
00:58:49,493 --> 00:58:51,256
It's definitely him.

693
00:58:51,662 --> 00:58:53,459
Hussein Abad al-Chir.

694
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:56,557
His room is next to
Israeli newlyweds.

695
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,532
They married in Cyprus
because she's not Jewish.

696
00:58:59,603 --> 00:59:01,036
A mixed marriage.

697
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:02,594
<i>A shande for the goyim.</i>

698
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:04,937
Yeah, okay. But let's
try not to blow them up.

699
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:08,307
The KGB brings him home
every night after dark.

700
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,846
He turns on the light,
gets undressed...

701
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:14,372
turns off the light, gets
into bed, we blow up the bed.

702
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:19,578
I knew a field agent who got
too scared to sleep in his bed.

703
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:22,921
So every night he slept
on the floor of his closet.

704
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,623
He still does, every night.

705
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:27,863
Sleeps in closets.

706
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:30,991
Now if al-Chir sleeps in
his closet, we're in trouble.

707
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:34,628
But if he gets in the bed,
his weight arms the device...

708
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,138
it closes the circuit.

709
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,441
Then we hit the remote.

710
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,078
Okay.

711
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:51,483
Okay, we're good.
We're good, let's go.

712
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:57,992
Careful.

713
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:04,557
I've checked into the room
next door.

714
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,495
Why?
There are balconies.

715
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:10,733
When he gets into bed...

716
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,742
I give the signal
by switching off the light.

717
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,345
And if the bomb's too powerful
and you're in the next room?

718
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:19,840
Well, that won't happen.

719
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:21,377
Right?

720
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:23,079
Robert?

721
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,347
Robert?
Robert?

722
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,090
It won't. No.

723
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:30,148
Okay.

724
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:33,022
Avner.

725
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:36,698
Boy or girl?

726
01:00:38,068 --> 01:00:39,296
A girl.

727
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:41,834
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

728
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:47,303
News from Paris.

729
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:51,945
Dr. Hamshari succumbed
to his wounds.

730
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:56,514
<i>So, again, mazel tov, Avner.</i>

731
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:53,166
Steve, shut up.

732
01:02:12,763 --> 01:02:13,787
Hey.

733
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:35,615
Good evening.

734
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,243
Good evening.

735
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:39,912
Beautiful night.

736
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,890
Beautiful night, yeah.

737
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:46,527
Where are you from? I can't place
- Dsseldorf.

738
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,962
Yes?
I wouldn't have guessed it.

739
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,459
I thought perhaps a Swede.

740
01:02:54,738 --> 01:02:57,605
I taught in Sweden,
Near Eastern languages.

741
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,302
Really?

742
01:02:59,843 --> 01:03:02,903
Teaching Lebanese immigrant
women how to clean houses.

743
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:04,378
In Swedish.

744
01:03:12,389 --> 01:03:14,357
Were you here last night?

745
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:17,817
No. Just checked in.
Just arrived.

746
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:21,025
Don't plan to sleep.

747
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,656
They keep at it all night.

748
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:25,895
There, for hours.

749
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,367
Take a sleeping pill.
That's okay.

750
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:29,996
I can sleep through anything.
Are you sure?

751
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:31,267
You don't want to borrow
one of mine?

752
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:33,002
Thank you very much. It's okay. Really?

753
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:34,134
Yes.

754
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:36,075
So, good night.

755
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:38,505
Pleasant dreams.

756
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,387
Wait for the signal.

757
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,956
Wait for Avner's light
to go out.

758
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:32,560
Go! Go! Go!

759
01:05:51,915 --> 01:05:53,610
Oh, my God!
Help!

760
01:05:55,085 --> 01:05:58,054
Oh, my eyes.
My eyes, I can't see.

761
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:00,119
Can someone help me?

762
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:01,781
I can't see.

763
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:03,147
Avner!

764
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,424
Please! Oh, my God!

765
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,466
I can't see.

766
01:06:14,204 --> 01:06:15,865
Can you see?
Yes.

767
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:17,304
The stairs are that way.
Okay.

768
01:06:17,374 --> 01:06:19,604
Go that way.
Come on. Let's go!

769
01:06:21,745 --> 01:06:24,009
<i>It was much too powerful.
Stop it.</i>

770
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,911
<i>You could've blown up innocent
- Target number three.</i>

771
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,142
<i>Target number three
was not in doubt.</i>

772
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:29,549
The ceiling in the lobby
cracked. You nearly demolished...

773
01:06:29,619 --> 01:06:31,143
Avner might have been killed.

774
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:32,778
The plastique was not
what I asked for.

775
01:06:32,856 --> 01:06:34,551
It couldn't have been
the grade I specified.

776
01:06:34,624 --> 01:06:36,649
Someone changed the marking
on the explosive.

777
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,694
What if someone changed
the marking?

778
01:06:38,762 --> 01:06:40,753
What do you mean?
Louis provided the plastique.

779
01:06:40,864 --> 01:06:43,355
Avner, Louis provided
the explosives?

780
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:45,924
Yes. Why?
Why are we trusting him?

781
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:48,828
We have no idea who he is.

782
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:50,902
He's finding our targets.
Yes, but-

783
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:53,204
But without him,
we'd be nowhere on this!

784
01:06:53,276 --> 01:06:56,643
The plastique was much more
powerful than what I asked for.

785
01:06:57,247 --> 01:07:00,216
Someone changed the label.
I could have killed you.

786
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:02,614
For all we know,
Louis works for the PLO.

787
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:05,153
They're using us to do
internal housecleaning.

788
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:06,277
That's bullshit.

789
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:08,721
Hey,
whose fishing boat is this?

790
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,226
Louis arranged it.

791
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,162
There was nothing wrong
with the explosive.

792
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:54,328
Bomb makers are nervous,
which is understandable.

793
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:55,632
Fear makes them sloppy-

794
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,103
There's nothing wrong
with my bomb maker.

795
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,371
It's your explosives.

796
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:02,911
We found three more
names for you.

797
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,847
Three?
Yes, three.

798
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:10,383
Thought you'd be pleased.
I am.

799
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:12,879
Who?

800
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:17,490
Kemal Adwan, Kamal Nasser,
and Abu Youssef.

801
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,362
Adwan and Abu Youssef.

802
01:08:21,064 --> 01:08:22,827
Where?
Lebanon.

803
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:25,361
They're in Beirut.

804
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:27,630
Adwan, Nasser, Youssef.

805
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:30,339
Serious characters, huh?

806
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,067
Extremely serious.

807
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:36,076
Smile, Mr. Storsch.
It's a second Christmas.

808
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:40,782
I'd like to pay you
a little extra for this.

809
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,511
These three names.

810
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:45,920
$600,000.

811
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:51,259
<i>Monsieur Storsch, my group...</i>

812
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,919
we don't care much
for governments...

813
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:54,463
any governments.

814
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:56,396
We don't work with
or for them.

815
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,900
That's an absolute condition
of my theory.

816
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,526
You understand?

817
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:03,595
If I learn that your sudden
generosity was an attempt...

818
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:07,040
to buy our acquiescence in
your sharing my information...

819
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:10,841
with, let us say,
CIA or Ml6 or Mossad-

820
01:09:10,914 --> 01:09:13,940
I don't work for Ml6 or CIA
- You have no idea who you work for.

821
01:09:14,017 --> 01:09:15,211
Trust me. You don't.

822
01:09:16,419 --> 01:09:19,855
Lie to me and you will find me
abruptly unreachable...

823
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:21,922
and unhappy.

824
01:09:23,226 --> 01:09:26,320
Let me buy you a drink.
No. You save your money.

825
01:09:26,396 --> 01:09:28,728
At these prices,
you're going to need it.

826
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,064
<i>It's obviously
significant information.</i>

827
01:09:32,135 --> 01:09:36,128
Abu Youssef is like number three
in the whole Palestinian network.

828
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,133
It's like Arafat, Habash,
and then him.

829
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:40,176
Of course he's significant.
Thanks for the instruction...

830
01:09:40,243 --> 01:09:42,074
and enthusiasm. He's the
brains of the fedayeen.

831
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:44,238
I know who he is.
Next to Salameh...

832
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,675
Abu Youssef is the worst guy
we're after, right?

833
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:49,775
And Adwan, he plans all the
actions in the West Bank, right?

834
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:53,086
We get the significance.
These are serious targets.

835
01:09:53,156 --> 01:09:54,748
We want to go to Beirut.
No.

836
01:09:54,824 --> 01:09:56,348
You keep away
from the Arab countries.

837
01:09:56,426 --> 01:09:58,792
Mossad and the army
will take care of it.

838
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,829
What is this contraption?

839
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:03,730
You can't send the army.
We won't allow it.

840
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:06,797
You won't allow it?

841
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:08,996
Our source doesn't know
we're Mossad.

842
01:10:09,072 --> 01:10:10,471
You aren't Mossad.

843
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:13,168
If commandos go to Beirut,
our source will cut us off.

844
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:16,335
Why don't you and I go for a
walk and talk about this, alone?

845
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:17,777
The food will get cold.

846
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:19,906
We have to go to Beirut.
We're good at this.

847
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:21,814
This is our information,
this is our job.

848
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:24,250
That's touching
in a juvenile sort of way.

849
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,878
Listen.
You're doing reasonably well.

850
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:27,684
Reasonably? You're
spending a lot of money.

851
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:29,190
Well, we expected that.

852
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:34,586
Lots of people in Mossad
don't know about you.

853
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,198
No one knows.

854
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:38,926
So everyone's asking,
"Who's killing the fedayeen?

855
01:10:39,002 --> 01:10:41,027
"Is it our guys?
Why weren't we told?"

856
01:10:41,104 --> 01:10:43,265
Big egos. Lots of screaming.

857
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,266
I can maybe include
one or two of you...

858
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:49,811
but excluding Mossad
or the army is impossible.

859
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:51,210
Accept it.

860
01:10:51,381 --> 01:10:53,611
We will,
but our source won't.

861
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,446
Who is your source?

862
01:10:57,887 --> 01:10:58,945
It's time you told me.

863
01:10:59,022 --> 01:11:01,047
That, by the way, is not
a request. It's an order.

864
01:11:01,124 --> 01:11:03,115
You can't order him.
He doesn't work for you.

865
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,717
Shut up. I pay you.
You work for me.

866
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:09,059
I work for a metal box in a
bank in Geneva. The box pays me.

867
01:11:09,165 --> 01:11:12,100
You want to find it empty? I
want you to let us do our work!

868
01:11:12,168 --> 01:11:14,159
What's the matter with you?

869
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:17,001
With all of you?
Grow up and do it quick.

870
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,597
This is not a game,
a fucking game.

871
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:22,472
Who has the source? Where are
you getting your information?

872
01:11:22,545 --> 01:11:24,638
Give me his goddamn number!

873
01:11:25,348 --> 01:11:27,543
I hope the old lady next door
enjoyed that.

874
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,814
She's a little deaf but I doubt
she had any trouble hearing you.

875
01:11:33,323 --> 01:11:36,383
Give me the source
and we'll let you take part.

876
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:38,622
Let us go to Beirut.

877
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:42,721
After Beirut, we'll use our source
to find the remaining targets.

878
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:44,827
Let us do our job.

879
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:31,140
A lot of manpower
to shoot three guys.

880
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:01,409
Ehud Barak.
Daniel.

881
01:13:38,281 --> 01:13:39,305
Go!

882
01:14:16,352 --> 01:14:18,149
Where the fuck is he?

883
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:22,049
Door!

884
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,394
Let's go!
Go!

885
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:33,390
Go! Go!

886
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:36,627
Go!

887
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:16,544
It's him!
Don't shoot! No!

888
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,126
Fedayeen!

889
01:15:43,406 --> 01:15:44,430
Go!

890
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:52,466
My papa would like to meet you. Papa?

891
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:55,643
My papa.
He runs our little group.

892
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,843
I thought you ran the group.

893
01:16:58,214 --> 01:17:00,341
Everybody works for someone.

894
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:03,713
I wasn't in Beirut.

895
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:06,154
Well, someone was there.

896
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:09,680
The Israeli army, according
to every newspaper on Earth.

897
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,487
But you stayed away...

898
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,859
after you paid so extravagantly
for the information.

899
01:17:15,031 --> 01:17:17,591
I don't like to keep
my papa waiting.

900
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,895
I need to tell my people
where I'm going.

901
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:21,800
You don't know
where you're going.

902
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:24,772
And you'll need
to wear this.

903
01:17:26,442 --> 01:17:27,909
Forget it, Louis.
That's just crazy.

904
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:29,569
We're done here.

905
01:17:36,052 --> 01:17:37,178
Shit.

906
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:39,009
Wait!

907
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:41,478
Wait!

908
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:28,935
We're here.

909
01:18:49,525 --> 01:18:50,719
Papa!

910
01:19:06,248 --> 01:19:07,237
He's over there.

911
01:19:20,796 --> 01:19:22,821
Louis says you're a cook.

912
01:19:22,998 --> 01:19:24,989
I know how to cook, yeah.

913
01:19:25,468 --> 01:19:26,867
You help me?

914
01:19:32,308 --> 01:19:33,969
Bring these there.

915
01:19:39,181 --> 01:19:43,481
No, no. Don't wash. No, no. They
will taste like boiled sponge.

916
01:19:43,786 --> 01:19:45,754
But then why put them
in the sink?

917
01:19:45,821 --> 01:19:48,312
If the juices spurt out,
it's a big mess.

918
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:51,018
The whole kitchen
will smell like piss.

919
01:19:52,928 --> 01:19:54,555
Peel off the fat.

920
01:19:58,067 --> 01:19:59,932
Let me see your hands.

921
01:20:02,905 --> 01:20:04,873
Too big for a good cook.

922
01:20:05,074 --> 01:20:07,542
That was my problem, too.
I had been a master...

923
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:11,011
but I have thick, stupid,
butcher's hands just like yours.

924
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:15,016
Well, we are tragic men.
Butcher's hands, gentle souls.

925
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:31,024
These are going to be
too sour to eat.

926
01:20:31,233 --> 01:20:34,566
Skin them and prick them,
boil them in sugar.

927
01:20:35,337 --> 01:20:38,602
A little torture, and
you'll see how nice they are.

928
01:20:39,608 --> 01:20:42,736
You call me "Papa. "
I can't do that.

929
01:20:42,812 --> 01:20:44,905
No?
I have a papa already.

930
01:20:47,082 --> 01:20:48,982
You are devoted to him?

931
01:20:49,618 --> 01:20:51,916
Am I here because of
what happened in Beirut?

932
01:20:51,987 --> 01:20:54,478
Your papa must be
proud of his son.

933
01:20:56,058 --> 01:20:58,891
We'll pick a few.
Let the rest ripen.

934
01:20:59,628 --> 01:21:01,493
There are so many people
to feed, but-

935
01:21:01,564 --> 01:21:03,498
But they are your family.
So you have to feed them.

936
01:21:03,566 --> 01:21:06,592
Yes. We don't work
with governments.

937
01:21:07,069 --> 01:21:08,696
Louis said. But...

938
01:21:08,771 --> 01:21:12,730
But you did what you did because
you have to feed your family.

939
01:21:31,562 --> 01:21:33,427
I blew up trains,
bridges...

940
01:21:33,497 --> 01:21:36,295
and trucks full of Germans
during the war.

941
01:21:38,002 --> 01:21:42,666
My brothers were killed, my papa
and my sister were both hanged.

942
01:21:43,741 --> 01:21:44,969
She was a young girl.

943
01:21:45,042 --> 01:21:48,478
Papa, the guest doesn't
want to hear your war stories.

944
01:21:49,213 --> 01:21:52,944
We paid this price, so Vichy
scum could be replaced...

945
01:21:53,017 --> 01:21:54,848
by Gaullist scum...

946
01:21:54,919 --> 01:21:58,446
and the Nazis could be
replaced by Stalin and America.

947
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:01,057
We stay away
from governments.

948
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:03,926
We say grace?

949
01:22:04,428 --> 01:22:06,658
Maybe our guest
could lead us.

950
01:22:11,101 --> 01:22:13,001
No, no, no.
It's not required.

951
01:22:21,111 --> 01:22:24,808
Our Father, who gives us
obedient and respectful clients...

952
01:22:25,049 --> 01:22:27,517
who obey the rules according
to which our business thrives-

953
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:32,648
...whose prevarications
and deceptions-

954
01:22:43,734 --> 01:22:46,396
In my despair
I fathered madmen...

955
01:22:47,338 --> 01:22:51,365
who dress like factory workers,
but never do manual labor...

956
01:22:51,542 --> 01:22:54,602
and who read nonsense
and spout pompous bullshit...

957
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:58,079
about Algerians
and who love nothing...

958
01:22:58,148 --> 01:22:59,638
not Algerians or French...

959
01:22:59,717 --> 01:23:02,379
or flesh and blood,
or anything living.

960
01:23:03,287 --> 01:23:07,087
So I have sympathy for a man
who can say, "I have a papa"...

961
01:23:07,391 --> 01:23:08,983
and who does what he must
for his family.

962
01:23:15,933 --> 01:23:17,560
I will say grace.

963
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,701
There's some opinion
you should be punished...

964
01:23:28,779 --> 01:23:30,940
for what happened
in Beirut.

965
01:23:31,248 --> 01:23:33,239
We didn't know
so many would die.

966
01:23:33,317 --> 01:23:36,775
I'm in business with death.
Do you think I'm squeamish?

967
01:23:39,323 --> 01:23:42,588
The world has been rough
with you, with your tribe.

968
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:47,989
It's right to respond roughly
to such treatment.

969
01:23:49,633 --> 01:23:53,831
You pay well and you pay promptly,
so we'll continue together.

970
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:58,736
But no more infractions.
Thank you. You have my word.

971
01:24:13,624 --> 01:24:17,617
A few andouillettes
and boudins noirs...

972
01:24:18,862 --> 01:24:23,060
black blood sausage and a
Loire cheese, Selles-sur-Cher.

973
01:24:23,901 --> 01:24:26,961
We cover it in ash to
preserve it. Thank you.

974
01:24:28,505 --> 01:24:30,598
You could have been my son.

975
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:36,402
But you're not.
Remember that.

976
01:24:37,848 --> 01:24:41,875
We'll do business,
but you aren't family.

977
01:25:30,634 --> 01:25:32,659
I have a new name for you.

978
01:25:33,904 --> 01:25:35,929
I want Ali Hassan Salameh.

979
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:39,801
No.

980
01:25:40,978 --> 01:25:43,242
You know where he is. You
know where all the names are.

981
01:25:43,313 --> 01:25:45,975
Salameh.
Untouchable.

982
01:25:48,252 --> 01:25:49,549
Salameh.

983
01:25:57,628 --> 01:25:59,118
Zaid Muchassi.

984
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:05,562
Zaid Muchassi is in Athens
in two weeks.

985
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:08,695
Not one of our names.
Nevertheless.

986
01:26:08,939 --> 01:26:11,464
He is Black September's
KGB contact.

987
01:26:11,675 --> 01:26:14,075
Hussein al-Chir
was the KGB contact.

988
01:26:14,144 --> 01:26:17,545
<i>Yes. But you put a bomb under
Monsieur al-Chir's bed in Cyprus...</i>

989
01:26:17,614 --> 01:26:20,811
and now he's defunct.
Muchassi is his replacement.

990
01:26:21,251 --> 01:26:24,243
I hear he's much tougher
than his predecessor.

991
01:26:30,194 --> 01:26:33,652
We offer Muchassi's
whereabouts at the new rate.

992
01:26:33,964 --> 01:26:37,422
What new rate?
Three names for $600,000...

993
01:26:37,501 --> 01:26:40,026
is $200,000 for one name.

994
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:47,802
I need you to find me
a place to work in Athens.

995
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:50,945
Of course. Safe house.

996
01:27:13,871 --> 01:27:16,101
Is this Louis's idea
of a joke?

997
01:27:16,807 --> 01:27:19,605
I've had nightmares
that looked like this.

998
01:27:21,511 --> 01:27:24,412
So when they explode, they toss
little white balls of phosphorus...

999
01:27:24,481 --> 01:27:27,814
here all around his room. Each
ball, it's like a little sun.

1000
01:27:27,885 --> 01:27:29,853
It burns at around
5,000 degrees.

1001
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,787
So the air catches fire.

1002
01:27:33,223 --> 01:27:35,623
Everything in the vicinity
melts.

1003
01:27:35,692 --> 01:27:37,626
Now, the bad news is
they are grenades...

1004
01:27:37,694 --> 01:27:40,891
so I modified them to use
with a remote detonator.

1005
01:27:41,198 --> 01:27:43,166
I also should mention
that they're quite old...

1006
01:27:43,233 --> 01:27:44,222
like World War II.

1007
01:27:44,701 --> 01:27:47,761
Only four were viable.
We should dump the rest.

1008
01:27:48,805 --> 01:27:51,569
There's a porter at the hotel
where Muchassi's staying.

1009
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:53,803
He's gonna let us in the room
when Muchassi goes out.

1010
01:27:53,877 --> 01:27:56,937
Hey. Who provided these
prehistoric explosives?

1011
01:27:57,014 --> 01:28:00,108
Louis.
Yeah. I'll thank him for that.

1012
01:28:14,431 --> 01:28:15,659
Tallyho.

1013
01:28:37,821 --> 01:28:39,755
Stop! Stop!

1014
01:28:39,823 --> 01:28:43,486
PLO! PLO!
ETA! ETA!

1015
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,721
Put the gun down
or we'll shoot.

1016
01:28:45,796 --> 01:28:48,629
Basque! Basque!

1017
01:28:50,934 --> 01:28:53,459
Okay.

1018
01:29:01,278 --> 01:29:04,145
Put the gun down!
Put it down!

1019
01:29:11,488 --> 01:29:12,887
Put it down.

1020
01:29:36,513 --> 01:29:40,745
Which French? Louis?
Who are you? English?

1021
01:29:41,752 --> 01:29:45,552
Basque. ETA.
Red Army Faction.

1022
01:29:46,189 --> 01:29:49,590
He's ANC.
African. African.

1023
01:29:51,161 --> 01:29:54,028
We are from Amman.
I'm Ali.

1024
01:29:55,132 --> 01:29:58,966
Said. George. Abed.

1025
01:30:01,171 --> 01:30:03,036
We paid for two nights.

1026
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:06,204
He said it was safe.

1027
01:30:06,676 --> 01:30:11,113
He told us the same.
Yes. Safe house.

1028
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:14,415
Yes.

1029
01:30:17,421 --> 01:30:18,911
So we're safe?

1030
01:30:20,991 --> 01:30:22,083
Safe.

1031
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,421
Everyone is safe.

1032
01:31:32,662 --> 01:31:36,325
Eventually the Arab states
will rise against Israel.

1033
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,629
They don't like Palestinians,
but they hate the Jews more.

1034
01:31:41,338 --> 01:31:43,499
It won't be like 1967.

1035
01:31:43,573 --> 01:31:47,441
The rest of the world will see by
then what the Israelis do to us.

1036
01:31:47,511 --> 01:31:51,345
They won't help when Egypt
and Syria attack. Even Jordan.

1037
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:54,141
Israel will cease
to exist.

1038
01:31:57,921 --> 01:31:58,910
What?

1039
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:04,083
This is a dream. You can't take
back a country you never had.

1040
01:32:04,661 --> 01:32:06,322
You sound like a Jew.
Fuck you.

1041
01:32:06,396 --> 01:32:09,456
I'm the voice inside your head
telling you what you already know.

1042
01:32:09,533 --> 01:32:11,763
You people have nothing
to bargain with.

1043
01:32:12,369 --> 01:32:13,961
You'll never get
the land back.

1044
01:32:14,037 --> 01:32:17,666
You'll all die old men in refugee
camps waiting for Palestine.

1045
01:32:17,774 --> 01:32:20,334
We have a lot of children.
They'll have children.

1046
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:21,900
So we can wait forever.

1047
01:32:21,978 --> 01:32:25,539
And if we need to, we can make
the whole planet unsafe for Jews.

1048
01:32:25,615 --> 01:32:27,776
You kill Jews and the world
feels bad for them...

1049
01:32:27,851 --> 01:32:30,251
and thinks you are animals.
Yes.

1050
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:33,380
But then the world will see how
they've made us into animals.

1051
01:32:33,456 --> 01:32:37,449
They'll start to ask questions
about the conditions in our cages.

1052
01:32:38,461 --> 01:32:42,261
You are Arabs. There are lots
of places for Arabs.

1053
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,991
You're a Jew sympathizer.

1054
01:32:47,137 --> 01:32:49,970
All you Germans,
you're too soft on Israel.

1055
01:32:50,674 --> 01:32:54,110
Well, you give us money, but
you feel guilty about Hitler.

1056
01:32:54,177 --> 01:32:56,509
And the Jews exploit
that guilt.

1057
01:32:57,314 --> 01:32:59,544
My father didn't gas
any Jews.

1058
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:06,354
Tell me something, Ali.
What?

1059
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:10,854
Do you really miss
your father's olive trees?

1060
01:33:11,661 --> 01:33:15,791
Do you honestly think you have to
get back all that... that nothing?

1061
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:18,162
That chalky soil
and stone huts.

1062
01:33:18,235 --> 01:33:21,102
Is that what you really
want for your children?

1063
01:33:21,171 --> 01:33:22,934
It absolutely is.

1064
01:33:25,675 --> 01:33:28,576
It will take a hundred years,
but we'll win.

1065
01:33:29,813 --> 01:33:33,271
How long did it take the Jews
to get their own country?

1066
01:33:33,917 --> 01:33:36,886
How long did it take
the Germans to make Germany?

1067
01:33:36,953 --> 01:33:38,818
And look how well
that worked out.

1068
01:33:38,888 --> 01:33:41,823
You don't know what it is
not to have a home.

1069
01:33:42,092 --> 01:33:44,890
That's why you European Reds
don't get it.

1070
01:33:45,495 --> 01:33:49,295
You say, "It's nothing," but
you have a home to come back to.

1071
01:33:50,267 --> 01:33:53,031
ETA, ANC, IRA...

1072
01:33:53,103 --> 01:33:56,231
we all pretend we care about
your international revolution...

1073
01:33:56,306 --> 01:33:57,967
but we don't care.

1074
01:33:58,875 --> 01:34:00,740
We want to be nations.

1075
01:34:02,212 --> 01:34:03,941
Home is everything.

1076
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:47,421
No, no, no.
No, I watch.

1077
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:50,924
You only take money
enclosed in papers, yes?

1078
01:34:50,994 --> 01:34:52,325
Of course.

1079
01:35:45,315 --> 01:35:46,680
Look there.

1080
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:50,644
Here they come
in their pumpkin coach.

1081
01:35:54,457 --> 01:35:56,448
The Russians and...

1082
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:01,153
Cinderella.

1083
01:36:20,583 --> 01:36:24,417
Do we detonate if the other
Arabs go into the room with him?

1084
01:36:32,962 --> 01:36:34,691
Why are the Russians waiting?

1085
01:36:35,665 --> 01:36:39,624
Why don't they leave?
They are waiting.

1086
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:46,138
We are waiting. Stay calm.
Hey, I'm calm.

1087
01:36:57,954 --> 01:37:00,582
He's in his room. Do it.
Is he alone?

1088
01:37:00,990 --> 01:37:04,721
How do we know if he's alone?
Just flip the switch. Do it.

1089
01:37:12,068 --> 01:37:13,399
I don't understand it.
What's wrong?

1090
01:37:13,470 --> 01:37:15,267
It's a piece of shit.

1091
01:37:16,506 --> 01:37:19,134
What? Fuck! Not again.
Wait, wait.

1092
01:37:19,809 --> 01:37:23,108
Where's the explosion?
It should've exploded by now.

1093
01:37:23,413 --> 01:37:25,574
What's gone wrong?
It's another malfunction.

1094
01:37:25,648 --> 01:37:26,672
You know what?

1095
01:37:26,749 --> 01:37:28,614
Or maybe it's delayed-
He has fucked up again!

1096
01:37:28,685 --> 01:37:31,017
Or maybe it could still blow
up. This is a waste of time!

1097
01:37:31,087 --> 01:37:33,317
Careful with that stuff,
Hans.

1098
01:37:39,329 --> 01:37:40,853
Hans!
Hans, what are you doing?

1099
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:42,693
Hans, get back here!

1100
01:37:45,602 --> 01:37:49,265
Hey, hey!
What is he doing?

1101
01:37:49,339 --> 01:37:50,931
Hans. No, no.

1102
01:38:19,068 --> 01:38:21,298
So how long
is he going to be?

1103
01:38:22,505 --> 01:38:24,029
Maybe one hour.

1104
01:39:25,101 --> 01:39:26,295
I know you.

1105
01:39:28,071 --> 01:39:30,266
Stop!

1106
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,660
Get in! Head down!

1107
01:40:25,261 --> 01:40:29,095
Ali? Ali? Ali?

1108
01:40:35,638 --> 01:40:38,573
Are you incapable of making
something that works?

1109
01:40:38,641 --> 01:40:40,734
Shut up! You shut up!

1110
01:40:40,810 --> 01:40:42,368
Does anybody speak Greek?

1111
01:40:42,445 --> 01:40:44,777
Shut him up!
Did we kill a Russian?

1112
01:40:44,847 --> 01:40:46,781
That's not good! Where
did you get your training?

1113
01:40:46,849 --> 01:40:49,841
Every single bomb, every
fucking one, is fucked up.

1114
01:40:49,919 --> 01:40:51,819
I was not trained to do this!

1115
01:40:51,888 --> 01:40:55,187
I was trained to dismantle
bombs, not to build them!

1116
01:40:57,927 --> 01:40:59,292
Holy shit.

1117
01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:04,691
Shin Bet wanted bomb dismantlers.
They picked me from the army.

1118
01:41:05,034 --> 01:41:06,524
A toy maker.
Give me some money.

1119
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:09,162
They figured I was good
with small machines.

1120
01:41:10,039 --> 01:41:14,476
But then after Munich, they asked
if I could build bombs instead.

1121
01:41:15,678 --> 01:41:17,168
So I said yes.

1122
01:41:23,553 --> 01:41:26,716
Come on. Here.

1123
01:41:35,798 --> 01:41:38,164
<i>The three went to the
side of the customs hall...</i>

1124
01:41:38,234 --> 01:41:41,260
<i>took out pieces of their rifles,
and quickly assembled them.</i>

1125
01:41:41,337 --> 01:41:44,534
<i>Then they threw hand grenades into
the long queues of passengers...</i>

1126
01:41:44,607 --> 01:41:48,600
<i>waiting to clear passport
control and began automatic fire.</i>

1127
01:41:48,678 --> 01:41:50,908
<i>It was all over
in a matter of minutes.</i>

1128
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:52,777
<i>And the firing
was indiscriminate.</i>

1129
01:41:52,849 --> 01:41:54,282
Salameh is in London.

1130
01:41:57,320 --> 01:42:00,847
He goes there periodically
to meet with his CIA contact.

1131
01:42:01,691 --> 01:42:05,149
His what?
Salameh works for the CIA.

1132
01:42:06,262 --> 01:42:07,524
Bullshit.

1133
01:42:07,697 --> 01:42:10,131
Salameh guarantees
that Black September...

1134
01:42:10,199 --> 01:42:11,962
won't touch
American diplomats.

1135
01:42:12,034 --> 01:42:14,969
In exchange, the CIA
gives him lots of money.

1136
01:42:15,104 --> 01:42:17,265
And they don't ask
what he uses it for.

1137
01:42:19,275 --> 01:42:21,539
Did he tell them
about Munich in advance?

1138
01:42:21,611 --> 01:42:23,238
Did the CIA
know about Munich?

1139
01:42:23,312 --> 01:42:25,780
The CIA didn't even know
Black September existed...

1140
01:42:25,848 --> 01:42:27,372
before Munich.

1141
01:42:28,718 --> 01:42:30,879
<i>One of the guerrillas was shot
through the head...</i>

1142
01:42:30,953 --> 01:42:32,181
<i>by a ricochet bullet.</i>

1143
01:42:32,255 --> 01:42:34,746
<i>A second was blown up
by his own hand grenade.</i>

1144
01:42:34,824 --> 01:42:36,917
Since then,
he's been busy.

1145
01:42:37,794 --> 01:42:39,125
Hasn't he?

1146
01:42:40,463 --> 01:42:42,761
All manner
of costly exercises.

1147
01:42:43,266 --> 01:42:45,496
Shooting tourists
in the Athens airport...

1148
01:42:45,568 --> 01:42:47,968
blowing up pharmacies
in Amsterdam...

1149
01:42:48,037 --> 01:42:51,097
and that Mossad agent
in Barcelona before that.

1150
01:42:51,741 --> 01:42:56,269
Europe hasn't been this interesting
since Napoleon marched to Moscow.

1151
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:59,307
Do you have to
do that here?

1152
01:43:00,016 --> 01:43:03,747
Salameh is in London.
For the usual price.

1153
01:43:12,995 --> 01:43:15,486
We followed him from
his doctor to his hotel.

1154
01:43:15,565 --> 01:43:17,863
He's here for eye treatment.
Salameh. You saw him?

1155
01:43:17,934 --> 01:43:19,231
You followed him?
Yes.

1156
01:43:19,302 --> 01:43:21,497
Wearing sunglasses in the
rain. Why didn't you shoot him?

1157
01:43:21,571 --> 01:43:22,970
There were bodyguards.
Civilians.

1158
01:43:23,072 --> 01:43:24,266
Were they armed?
Yes.

1159
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:26,740
Well then, they're not
civilians. I'd have done it...

1160
01:43:26,809 --> 01:43:28,709
if you'd give me half a chance
to actually shoot someone.

1161
01:43:28,778 --> 01:43:31,178
I'm the only one who actually
wants to shoot these guys.

1162
01:43:31,247 --> 01:43:32,976
Maybe that's why
we never let you do it.

1163
01:43:33,049 --> 01:43:35,279
We only go after our targets.
Since when?

1164
01:43:35,351 --> 01:43:37,046
I mean, why are we worried
about that now?

1165
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:40,213
Do you have any idea
how many laws we've broken?

1166
01:43:40,523 --> 01:43:43,822
It's time to stop your
agonizing. It's counterproductive.

1167
01:43:43,893 --> 01:43:47,329
Including, incidentally, the
laws of the state of Israel...

1168
01:43:47,396 --> 01:43:48,693
which has no death penalty.

1169
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:51,358
<i>You know what your problem is,
habibi?</i>

1170
01:43:51,467 --> 01:43:52,934
You're disorientated.

1171
01:43:53,002 --> 01:43:55,470
Because the guys we're killing
are dressed in expensive suits...

1172
01:43:55,538 --> 01:43:57,904
and this is London and
not some ugly Arab village.

1173
01:43:57,974 --> 01:43:59,669
I'm not disoriented.

1174
01:43:59,742 --> 01:44:02,210
I'm keeping my sanity by
occasionally reminding myself...

1175
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:03,370
that in spite of-

1176
01:44:03,446 --> 01:44:05,209
But it's the same old war
we're fighting...

1177
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:06,543
I'm still, at least in
principle, a human being.

1178
01:44:06,616 --> 01:44:07,913
...over the same old
scrap of desert!

1179
01:44:07,984 --> 01:44:10,384
It's just we've brought our war
to Copenhagen and Kensington...

1180
01:44:10,453 --> 01:44:12,944
and it's not like these European
anti-Semites don't deserve that.

1181
01:44:13,022 --> 01:44:16,287
Unless we learn to act like
them, we will never defeat them.

1182
01:44:16,359 --> 01:44:18,589
We act like them
all the time.

1183
01:44:18,728 --> 01:44:20,958
What, you think the
Palestinians invented bloodshed?

1184
01:44:21,030 --> 01:44:23,498
How do you think we got control
of the land? By being nice?

1185
01:44:23,566 --> 01:44:25,966
Somebody pull down this man's
pants. See if he's circumcised.

1186
01:44:26,035 --> 01:44:27,559
I think we have a double agent
in our midst.

1187
01:44:27,637 --> 01:44:30,299
Don't you dare accuse
me of that! Stop it!

1188
01:44:30,373 --> 01:44:33,274
My son died in '67, you
foul-mouthed son of a bitch.

1189
01:44:33,342 --> 01:44:35,572
Everything you can ask,
I've done for Israel.

1190
01:44:35,645 --> 01:44:38,705
Ask for a reassignment
if this is so distasteful.

1191
01:44:38,781 --> 01:44:41,306
Why, it's not distasteful to you? No.

1192
01:44:42,351 --> 01:44:45,377
'Cause the only blood that
matters to me is Jewish blood.

1193
01:44:47,957 --> 01:44:50,824
Nice job, eh.
Nice job leading.

1194
01:44:52,929 --> 01:44:55,090
If the bodyguards are armed,
we kill them.

1195
01:44:55,164 --> 01:44:57,894
They're armed.
Well, then we kill them!

1196
01:45:44,547 --> 01:45:45,639
Taxi!

1197
01:45:45,781 --> 01:45:46,770
Taxi!

1198
01:46:30,559 --> 01:46:33,255
Roger Burke, you ugly fuck!
What are you doing in London?

1199
01:46:33,329 --> 01:46:35,263
Get your hands off me.

1200
01:46:35,431 --> 01:46:37,592
Put them up. Put them
up, you fat, wet puss!

1201
01:46:37,666 --> 01:46:39,429
Let's show these limey fucks
what we're made of.

1202
01:46:39,502 --> 01:46:42,198
Hey, wait a minute! Who the fuck...
Who do you think this is then?

1203
01:46:42,271 --> 01:46:43,568
Roger Burke.
Who do you think this is?

1204
01:46:43,639 --> 01:46:46,472
No, you idiot. That is not-
Lay off him, asshole.

1205
01:46:46,575 --> 01:46:49,237
That's not him. Come on.
It's Roger Burke.

1206
01:46:49,945 --> 01:46:51,105
I'm sorry about my friend,
you know?

1207
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:54,513
He's a fucked-up, belligerent guy
with a serious drinking problem.

1208
01:46:54,583 --> 01:46:58,041
Hey, come here.
Lose it.

1209
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:00,418
Come on. Calm down!
Hey, calm down.

1210
01:47:00,489 --> 01:47:03,014
Hey, come here!
Calm down!

1211
01:47:05,661 --> 01:47:09,188
Back off. Get back!

1212
01:47:09,265 --> 01:47:11,563
Back off! Back off!
Fuck off!

1213
01:47:11,634 --> 01:47:13,101
It's me. All right!

1214
01:47:13,169 --> 01:47:15,399
All right. Come on.
Fuck off!

1215
01:47:15,838 --> 01:47:18,204
It's me, Roger, Orrin!
Come on.

1216
01:47:18,274 --> 01:47:22,608
It's me. Remember me? Sorry.
It's all right.

1217
01:47:23,712 --> 01:47:25,942
You should have ducked,
Roger!

1218
01:47:32,822 --> 01:47:34,414
Fucking Americans!

1219
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:36,253
What the fuck is that?
Was it Salameh?

1220
01:47:36,325 --> 01:47:38,486
Yes, of course
it was fucking Salameh!

1221
01:48:00,316 --> 01:48:02,841
I take it she'd
eat you up a bit, huh?

1222
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:05,812
You old dog.

1223
01:48:06,088 --> 01:48:07,851
He's got some ideas.

1224
01:48:09,225 --> 01:48:11,716
Oh, the American bloke?
Aren't we all?

1225
01:48:12,161 --> 01:48:14,891
So you've heard these rumors?
These are wild stories.

1226
01:48:14,964 --> 01:48:16,932
Wild stories.
Yeah?

1227
01:48:16,999 --> 01:48:17,988
Yeah.

1228
01:48:43,025 --> 01:48:44,185
Can I?

1229
01:48:52,334 --> 01:48:56,634
I have to go to bed soon.
I work in the morning.

1230
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:59,767
What kind of work do you do?

1231
01:49:02,444 --> 01:49:04,878
The kind that drives you
to drink.

1232
01:49:05,648 --> 01:49:07,377
We must have the same job,
then.

1233
01:49:09,351 --> 01:49:11,080
I love your accent.

1234
01:49:12,087 --> 01:49:13,645
I love your perfume.

1235
01:49:24,166 --> 01:49:26,361
Cuts right through
the smoke.

1236
01:49:28,337 --> 01:49:29,565
Does it?

1237
01:49:30,739 --> 01:49:32,502
It's very nice.

1238
01:49:37,379 --> 01:49:40,542
Look, I don't want
to be forward...

1239
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:42,842
but it's late...

1240
01:49:43,319 --> 01:49:46,618
and I do have to get up early.

1241
01:49:47,289 --> 01:49:48,449
So...

1242
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:52,525
So?
So...

1243
01:49:54,163 --> 01:49:56,358
So, you're very nice, and...

1244
01:49:59,868 --> 01:50:02,393
Are you really going
to make me ask?

1245
01:50:09,278 --> 01:50:10,540
I just can't.

1246
01:50:11,914 --> 01:50:12,903
Pity.

1247
01:50:13,749 --> 01:50:16,411
You're very attractive.
I know.

1248
01:50:19,555 --> 01:50:21,147
If you come to your senses...

1249
01:50:21,223 --> 01:50:23,817
once you get up
to your lonely room...

1250
01:50:24,059 --> 01:50:26,050
well, maybe I'll be here.

1251
01:50:26,996 --> 01:50:31,365
Or maybe I'll be in my room,
alone in bed.

1252
01:50:38,274 --> 01:50:39,639
Good night.

1253
01:50:59,228 --> 01:51:02,493
The drunk Americans.
You think they were CIA?

1254
01:51:03,265 --> 01:51:06,666
They could've been.
For all we know, Louis is CIA.

1255
01:51:06,735 --> 01:51:09,397
They work both sides.
Everyone does.

1256
01:51:09,471 --> 01:51:12,440
Or Louis is Mossad.
Now, maybe he isn't...

1257
01:51:12,508 --> 01:51:14,169
but they're using him
to feed us information.

1258
01:51:14,243 --> 01:51:15,835
There's no direct link.

1259
01:51:15,911 --> 01:51:18,778
Or Mossad's giving it to CIA,
which is giving it to Louis...

1260
01:51:18,847 --> 01:51:20,678
and Ephraim's demanding
we give him Louis...

1261
01:51:20,749 --> 01:51:23,240
because he knows
we expect him to do-

1262
01:51:23,319 --> 01:51:26,220
Stop chasing the mice
inside your skull.

1263
01:51:31,327 --> 01:51:34,262
You know,
I never thought you'd last.

1264
01:51:35,497 --> 01:51:37,465
I thought the same about you.

1265
01:51:37,533 --> 01:51:40,263
From the beginning
you seemed so reluctant.

1266
01:51:40,336 --> 01:51:42,201
I was born reluctant.
Ask my mother.

1267
01:51:42,271 --> 01:51:43,932
If I can't kvetch,
I can't do my job.

1268
01:51:44,006 --> 01:51:45,974
You ever feel reluctant?

1269
01:51:46,308 --> 01:51:48,572
I'm not comfortable
with confusion.

1270
01:51:49,878 --> 01:51:52,278
I knew guys like you
in the army.

1271
01:51:52,648 --> 01:51:55,208
You'll do any terrifying thing
you're asked to do...

1272
01:51:55,284 --> 01:51:57,514
but you have to do it running.

1273
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:02,852
You think you can outrun
your fears, your doubts.

1274
01:52:04,727 --> 01:52:09,562
The only thing that really
scares you guys is stillness.

1275
01:52:11,533 --> 01:52:14,434
But everyone's overtaken,
eventually.

1276
01:52:16,205 --> 01:52:18,799
Now, the mice need a brandy.
Will you join me?

1277
01:52:18,874 --> 01:52:21,468
No, I'm going to go upstairs,
straight to bed.

1278
01:52:21,543 --> 01:52:22,771
You okay drinking
by yourself?

1279
01:52:22,845 --> 01:52:25,541
It's just a shot to numb
the brain. Good night.

1280
01:52:29,284 --> 01:52:30,273
Oh.

1281
01:52:30,786 --> 01:52:33,687
Beware of the local honey trap. Indeed?

1282
01:52:34,623 --> 01:52:37,387
You can't miss her.
You don't want to.

1283
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,240
Hello.

1284
01:52:59,348 --> 01:53:01,543
<i>This is a trunk call
from Mr. Storsch.</i>

1285
01:53:01,617 --> 01:53:02,879
<i>Do you accept the charges?</i>

1286
01:53:02,951 --> 01:53:06,114
Shit, Avner, you woke up the
baby, but that's okay... I mean...

1287
01:53:06,188 --> 01:53:07,587
How are you?

1288
01:53:08,724 --> 01:53:09,850
<i>I miss you.</i>

1289
01:53:10,692 --> 01:53:13,820
<i>You're in England
or Australia...</i>

1290
01:53:13,896 --> 01:53:16,296
<i>or the North Pole-
Yeah, that's right.</i>

1291
01:53:18,367 --> 01:53:20,528
So listen, I was thinking...

1292
01:53:20,602 --> 01:53:23,435
when I'm finished doing
what I'm doing here...

1293
01:53:23,505 --> 01:53:25,166
I want to come to Brooklyn
to see you.

1294
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:28,038
Brooklyn is depressing. It's
got more churches than Jerusalem.

1295
01:53:28,110 --> 01:53:29,270
Listen to her talk.

1296
01:53:31,947 --> 01:53:35,007
<i>Can you hear me? Can
she hear me? Yeah, yeah.</i>

1297
01:53:35,984 --> 01:53:39,181
<i>Hey. Talk to me.</i>

1298
01:53:41,824 --> 01:53:44,292
<i>Daphna, make her talk.</i>

1299
01:53:54,770 --> 01:53:55,759
Dada.

1300
01:54:00,709 --> 01:54:03,803
Hey. Hey, sweetheart. It's your papa.

1301
01:54:05,948 --> 01:54:07,973
This is my voice, darling.

1302
01:54:10,285 --> 01:54:13,277
This is what I sound like.
Don't forget, okay?

1303
01:54:15,524 --> 01:54:18,425
Listen, I have to get
her to bed. She's tired.

1304
01:54:18,494 --> 01:54:20,394
<i>She'll dream about you.</i>

1305
01:54:52,928 --> 01:54:56,762
<i>We're standing at a distance,
as instructed by the terrorists.</i>

1306
01:54:57,966 --> 01:55:00,491
Are we going?
Is it to the airport?

1307
01:55:00,569 --> 01:55:01,831
Can we talk to someone,
just to say-

1308
01:55:01,904 --> 01:55:03,872
Shut up, okay?
Just get on the bus, okay?

1309
01:55:03,939 --> 01:55:07,500
Just to tell our families.
Just to say we are all right!

1310
01:55:07,643 --> 01:55:10,407
Everybody, just relax, okay?
Relax! Calm down.

1311
01:55:10,479 --> 01:55:14,575
We will ride this bus and fly away.
After, you go back to your home...

1312
01:55:14,650 --> 01:55:16,641
or to your Olympic Games.

1313
01:57:14,703 --> 01:57:17,536
Carl. You asshole.

1314
01:57:18,340 --> 01:57:19,967
I saw her first.

1315
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:39,520
Carl?

1316
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:20,359
She's Dutch, not political,
entirely business-minded.

1317
01:59:20,896 --> 01:59:23,421
She lives in Hoorn.
She's there now.

1318
01:59:24,032 --> 01:59:26,057
This is dependable
information.

1319
01:59:26,134 --> 01:59:28,159
For which you pay nothing.

1320
01:59:28,436 --> 01:59:31,098
We're giving you this.
You understand why?

1321
01:59:31,173 --> 01:59:33,437
Because you want me to believe
that you had nothing to do...

1322
01:59:33,508 --> 01:59:35,373
with the murder of my partner.

1323
01:59:35,443 --> 01:59:38,970
We inhabit a world
of intersecting secrecies.

1324
01:59:39,347 --> 01:59:42,874
We live and die at the places
where those secrecies meet.

1325
01:59:42,951 --> 01:59:44,851
That's what we accept.

1326
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:48,655
We buy information for you
from your enemies.

1327
01:59:50,125 --> 01:59:51,285
This alerts them.

1328
01:59:51,359 --> 01:59:53,657
You're not the only people
looking for names.

1329
01:59:54,663 --> 01:59:56,654
You're telling me
I'm being hunted now?

1330
01:59:56,731 --> 01:59:59,632
He's telling you
it's time for you to quit.

1331
01:59:59,701 --> 02:00:03,501
The race is not to the swift,
nor the battle to the strong...

1332
02:00:03,605 --> 02:00:06,301
but time and chance
happens to them all.

1333
02:00:18,987 --> 02:00:20,750
Evil falls suddenly.

1334
02:00:23,058 --> 02:00:25,083
Who can say when it falls?

1335
02:00:48,483 --> 02:00:50,815
So you're really gonna
kill her?

1336
02:00:52,153 --> 02:00:56,214
All this blood comes back to
us. Eventually it will work.

1337
02:00:56,658 --> 02:00:59,354
Even if it takes years,
we'll beat them.

1338
02:01:00,395 --> 02:01:02,056
We're Jews, Avner.

1339
02:01:02,631 --> 02:01:04,724
Jews don't do wrong
because our enemies do wrong.

1340
02:01:04,799 --> 02:01:07,267
We can't afford to be
that decent anymore.

1341
02:01:07,369 --> 02:01:09,530
I don't know that
we ever were that decent.

1342
02:01:09,938 --> 02:01:13,840
Suffering thousands of years of
hatred doesn't make you decent.

1343
02:01:14,109 --> 02:01:17,806
But we're supposed to be
righteous. That's a beautiful thing.

1344
02:01:17,879 --> 02:01:19,244
That's Jewish.

1345
02:01:19,314 --> 02:01:21,475
That's what I knew,
that's what I was taught.

1346
02:01:22,684 --> 02:01:25,448
And now I'm losing it,
and I lose that, that's-

1347
02:01:25,553 --> 02:01:27,680
That's-
That's everything.

1348
02:01:28,356 --> 02:01:29,880
That's my soul.

1349
02:01:32,861 --> 02:01:36,024
You need to go rest somewhere.
You don't have to do this one.

1350
02:01:38,266 --> 02:01:40,131
When I need you again,
I'll find you.

1351
02:02:33,588 --> 02:02:35,749
Excuse me. Who are you?

1352
02:02:44,065 --> 02:02:45,555
Do you know why we're here?

1353
02:02:46,267 --> 02:02:47,757
I want to get dressed, okay?

1354
02:02:54,242 --> 02:02:57,439
Maybe you want to hire me.
You know how good I am.

1355
02:03:02,751 --> 02:03:03,877
No. Don't.

1356
02:03:04,719 --> 02:03:07,244
It's such a fucking waste
of talent.

1357
02:03:18,867 --> 02:03:20,698
Where're you going?
Stay here.

1358
02:03:20,769 --> 02:03:22,236
Shell. Shell.

1359
02:03:23,138 --> 02:03:24,230
Yeah.

1360
02:04:00,175 --> 02:04:01,437
Leave it.

1361
02:04:19,694 --> 02:04:22,857
<i>In seven months we've
killed six of the 11 names.</i>

1362
02:04:23,665 --> 02:04:25,895
<i>We've killed one replacement.</i>

1363
02:04:26,234 --> 02:04:28,327
<i>One of our targets
is in prison and four...</i>

1364
02:04:28,403 --> 02:04:31,236
<i>including Ali Hassan Salameh,
are at large.</i>

1365
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:34,165
<i>One of our own has fallen.</i>

1366
02:04:34,976 --> 02:04:38,002
<i>Since we began, the other side has
sent letter bombs to 11 embassies...</i>

1367
02:04:38,079 --> 02:04:40,047
<i>hijacked three planes...</i>

1368
02:04:40,548 --> 02:04:44,177
<i>killed 130 passengers in Athens
and wounded scores more...</i>

1369
02:04:44,819 --> 02:04:47,447
and killed our military
attach in Washington.

1370
02:04:47,555 --> 02:04:50,991
Some of it was done by a Venezuelan
called Carlos the Jackal...

1371
02:04:51,059 --> 02:04:52,959
who replaced Zaid Muchassi...

1372
02:04:53,061 --> 02:04:55,256
who replaced Hussein al-Chir.

1373
02:04:56,397 --> 02:04:59,958
Black September's original
leadership has been decimated.

1374
02:05:02,036 --> 02:05:04,334
But new leaders
are emerging...

1375
02:05:04,606 --> 02:05:07,200
for whom Black September
wasn't violent enough.

1376
02:05:10,211 --> 02:05:12,805
And to dispatch
our six dispatched targets...

1377
02:05:12,881 --> 02:05:16,180
we must have spent something
close to $2 million, right?

1378
02:05:16,251 --> 02:05:19,584
You've been cooking.
Are you expecting company?

1379
02:05:20,488 --> 02:05:22,820
Mrs. Meir
says to the Knesset...

1380
02:05:24,626 --> 02:05:27,254
the world must see
that killing Jews...

1381
02:05:27,462 --> 02:05:30,397
will be from now on
an expensive proposition.

1382
02:05:32,634 --> 02:05:34,932
But killing Palestinians
isn't exactly cheap.

1383
02:05:38,573 --> 02:05:42,168
If all 11 were dead, you'd stop? Yes.

1384
02:05:43,444 --> 02:05:47,540
You're lying.
What about their replacements?

1385
02:05:48,283 --> 02:05:51,116
With each time we kill,
we create six more.

1386
02:05:52,053 --> 02:05:53,850
Maybe they'll have to keep
killing them, then.

1387
02:05:53,922 --> 02:05:55,150
Forever.

1388
02:05:56,357 --> 02:05:58,450
Five targets are still alive.

1389
02:05:58,526 --> 02:06:00,517
That's five men
that need to be killed.

1390
02:06:00,595 --> 02:06:03,155
Eventually you forget that in
the beginning you hated doing it.

1391
02:06:03,231 --> 02:06:04,823
For me personally,
I feel less every day.

1392
02:06:04,899 --> 02:06:06,924
One day I'm going to wake up,
I'm going to kill...

1393
02:06:07,001 --> 02:06:09,993
I'm going to go back to bed, I'm
not going to feel anything at all.

1394
02:06:12,073 --> 02:06:16,237
Hey, Hans? You know there's a rule
in the book against blind drunks.

1395
02:06:16,511 --> 02:06:18,411
Why don't you stop drinking
and eat something?

1396
02:06:18,479 --> 02:06:21,778
I mean, there's enough food
here to feed Bangladesh.

1397
02:06:24,786 --> 02:06:28,449
I keep seeing that Dutch woman,
you know, sprawled out like that.

1398
02:06:31,926 --> 02:06:34,827
It's not that I wish
we hadn't killed her.

1399
02:06:35,129 --> 02:06:37,927
I wish I had let you
close up her housecoat.

1400
02:06:38,499 --> 02:06:42,060
Yeah,
but you weren't yourself.

1401
02:06:56,985 --> 02:06:58,145
Avner.

1402
02:07:01,055 --> 02:07:02,044
Avner.

1403
02:07:04,626 --> 02:07:05,615
Avner.

1404
02:07:06,194 --> 02:07:09,186
I went to Hans' flat
above the antique shop...

1405
02:07:09,764 --> 02:07:12,699
just to check up on him
because he was so...

1406
02:07:13,701 --> 02:07:16,568
Anyway, he's gone somewhere,
and I waited all night...

1407
02:07:16,638 --> 02:07:18,265
and he's not come back.

1408
02:07:39,394 --> 02:07:40,554
Knife.

1409
02:07:45,667 --> 02:07:47,692
They didn't take anything.

1410
02:12:09,830 --> 02:12:10,888
What?

1411
02:12:41,829 --> 02:12:43,626
It will be beautiful.

1412
02:12:45,099 --> 02:12:48,557
Ali Hassan Salameh is in
Tarifa on the Spanish coast.

1413
02:12:49,637 --> 02:12:53,266
He's at a compound guarded by
all the predictable trouble.

1414
02:12:53,641 --> 02:12:56,371
Bomb makers often die
accidental deaths.

1415
02:12:58,779 --> 02:13:01,077
In Athens
you shot a KGB agent.

1416
02:13:03,184 --> 02:13:06,483
<i>Many people must want
to kill you, Monsieur Storsch.</i>

1417
02:13:06,887 --> 02:13:10,186
But why would I do that?
You pay better than anyone.

1418
02:13:15,730 --> 02:13:18,221
It's dangerous
going after Salameh.

1419
02:13:19,533 --> 02:13:21,398
But he planned
the Munich massacre.

1420
02:13:25,539 --> 02:13:29,270
Eliminate him, and they'll let
you go home. Don't you think?

1421
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:34,407
Yes, Louis. I do.

1422
02:13:38,452 --> 02:13:41,285
You could have a kitchen
like that someday.

1423
02:13:44,392 --> 02:13:48,192
It costs dearly,
but home always does.

1424
02:14:44,885 --> 02:14:47,376
Shit!
It's like a funhouse in there.

1425
02:14:48,189 --> 02:14:50,054
Can you tell how many?

1426
02:15:09,844 --> 02:15:11,243
That's him.

1427
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:17,945
Are you sure it's him, Avner?

1428
02:15:19,620 --> 02:15:21,383
You have to be sure.

1429
02:16:23,584 --> 02:16:25,279
I'm Avner Kaufman.
We know.

1430
02:16:25,352 --> 02:16:27,752
You want to ride with us?
Hop in.

1431
02:16:28,155 --> 02:16:29,452
Please.

1432
02:16:35,296 --> 02:16:38,322
I'm Amos.
This is Avi. Shin Bet.

1433
02:16:39,233 --> 02:16:40,860
We're not supposed to know
who you are...

1434
02:16:42,036 --> 02:16:43,025
because we're not officers.

1435
02:16:43,337 --> 02:16:46,067
We're just shit
and no one tells us shit.

1436
02:16:47,875 --> 02:16:50,503
We've heard about
what you've done.

1437
02:16:52,513 --> 02:16:54,743
We want to say it's
an honor to meet you.

1438
02:16:59,987 --> 02:17:02,046
It's an honor for me,
too.

1439
02:17:11,498 --> 02:17:13,830
I have no problems
with anything you guys did...

1440
02:17:13,901 --> 02:17:16,734
except the woman on
the houseboat in Hoorn.

1441
02:17:17,371 --> 02:17:19,100
Steve's told us about her.

1442
02:17:19,173 --> 02:17:20,367
We took a leave
of absence...

1443
02:17:20,441 --> 02:17:21,772
and killed her
off the company clock.

1444
02:17:21,842 --> 02:17:22,900
Don't be an idiot.

1445
02:17:22,977 --> 02:17:26,037
Otherwise, as I said, we have
no problems with the job you did.

1446
02:17:26,981 --> 02:17:29,108
Except three
of my men died.

1447
02:17:29,183 --> 02:17:30,275
According
to your colleague...

1448
02:17:30,351 --> 02:17:32,478
I should say, emphatically,
according to your colleague...

1449
02:17:32,553 --> 02:17:34,111
not in any way your fault.

1450
02:17:34,188 --> 02:17:35,348
He sings your praises.

1451
02:17:35,422 --> 02:17:37,982
Best guy he ever worked for,
and so on.

1452
02:17:41,896 --> 02:17:45,059
He says this French group...
Louis was his name?

1453
02:17:45,332 --> 02:17:48,358
They sold the terrorists information
regarding your whereabouts.

1454
02:17:48,435 --> 02:17:50,130
They helped kill your men.

1455
02:17:51,438 --> 02:17:53,702
I know Steve believes that,
but it's not true.

1456
02:17:53,774 --> 02:17:55,071
Tell us who they are.

1457
02:17:57,678 --> 02:17:59,669
They won't work with you.

1458
02:18:01,115 --> 02:18:04,209
It's about loyalty.
You're an Israeli officer.

1459
02:18:04,385 --> 02:18:06,945
That's your only loyalty!
That's it!

1460
02:18:09,990 --> 02:18:11,082
Okay.

1461
02:18:12,559 --> 02:18:15,494
This is General Hofi
of the Northern Command.

1462
02:18:15,663 --> 02:18:17,153
You look good.

1463
02:18:17,865 --> 02:18:21,392
Listen, the Prime Minister
is proud of you and your men.

1464
02:18:21,568 --> 02:18:23,593
She wishes she could tell you
herself, but she can't.

1465
02:18:23,671 --> 02:18:25,605
She never heard of you,
right?

1466
02:18:26,407 --> 02:18:29,865
Good. She says you've done
a great thing for your people.

1467
02:18:29,944 --> 02:18:31,309
For Israel.

1468
02:18:35,749 --> 02:18:38,582
That's it.
There is no medal or anything.

1469
02:18:50,230 --> 02:18:53,290
June 16, 1973.
Avner Kaufman interview.

1470
02:18:55,769 --> 02:18:57,031
Go ahead.

1471
02:19:01,408 --> 02:19:03,399
Tell me what you learned.

1472
02:19:06,380 --> 02:19:08,280
What I learned?
Yes.

1473
02:19:08,515 --> 02:19:10,244
What did you learn?

1474
02:19:12,886 --> 02:19:14,319
For God's sake!

1475
02:19:14,488 --> 02:19:16,854
Tell me the names and numbers
of your sources.

1476
02:19:21,228 --> 02:19:22,718
Avner, tell me.

1477
02:19:22,796 --> 02:19:25,788
Tell me the names and numbers
of your sources.

1478
02:19:27,201 --> 02:19:28,395
Please.

1479
02:19:29,670 --> 02:19:32,571
I can have you
court-martialed, and I might.

1480
02:19:33,307 --> 02:19:36,435
You can't.
I don't work for you.

1481
02:19:38,379 --> 02:19:39,869
I don't exist.

1482
02:19:42,216 --> 02:19:45,117
You look terrible.
I'm not good right now.

1483
02:19:47,688 --> 02:19:51,522
You don't need to tell me
anything. It's taken a lot from you.

1484
02:19:52,226 --> 02:19:56,253
I'm alive, right? And
the rest sorts itself out.

1485
02:19:57,765 --> 02:20:01,201
I'm not a fool, Avner. I
never said you were a fool.

1486
02:20:11,278 --> 02:20:15,078
Everyone in Europe died.
Most of my family.

1487
02:20:16,050 --> 02:20:17,540
A huge family.

1488
02:20:21,188 --> 02:20:23,486
I never talked
to you about it.

1489
02:20:23,724 --> 02:20:26,659
I knew. You knew? So
what was there to say?

1490
02:20:28,128 --> 02:20:30,528
I didn't die,
because I came here.

1491
02:20:30,864 --> 02:20:34,300
When I arrived, I walked up to
the top of a hill in Jerusalem...

1492
02:20:34,368 --> 02:20:37,303
and prayed for a child.

1493
02:20:37,571 --> 02:20:40,563
I never prayed before,
but I was praying then.

1494
02:20:40,641 --> 02:20:43,906
And I could feel every
one of them praying with me.

1495
02:20:47,448 --> 02:20:49,541
You are what we prayed for.

1496
02:20:50,684 --> 02:20:52,879
What you did,
you did for us.

1497
02:20:53,320 --> 02:20:56,153
You did for your daughter,
but also for us.

1498
02:20:56,523 --> 02:20:59,754
Every one of the ones
who died, died wanting this.

1499
02:21:01,395 --> 02:21:05,024
We had to take it, because no
one will ever give it to us.

1500
02:21:05,165 --> 02:21:08,396
A place to be a Jew among
Jews, subject to no one.

1501
02:21:10,537 --> 02:21:12,971
I thank God for hearing
my prayer.

1502
02:21:15,142 --> 02:21:17,167
Do you want to know, Mama?

1503
02:21:18,712 --> 02:21:21,272
Do you want me to tell you
what I did?

1504
02:21:23,283 --> 02:21:24,307
No.

1505
02:21:25,786 --> 02:21:29,222
Whatever it took,
whatever it takes.

1506
02:21:31,125 --> 02:21:36,085
A place on Earth.
We have a place on Earth.

1507
02:21:37,531 --> 02:21:38,793
At last.

1508
02:21:48,675 --> 02:21:50,768
What's this?
Baklava.

1509
02:21:51,645 --> 02:21:54,842
From Rehovot? The only edible
baklava is from the Arabs in Jaffa.

1510
02:21:54,915 --> 02:21:57,110
Eat it on the plane.
You're too thin.

1511
02:21:57,217 --> 02:21:59,242
I hope it gives you
a bellyache.

1512
02:22:00,687 --> 02:22:02,052
Listen, forget it.

1513
02:22:02,122 --> 02:22:04,818
You go see your wife, your
child, rest for a few more months.

1514
02:22:04,892 --> 02:22:06,621
Then we're gonna put you
back in the field.

1515
02:22:06,693 --> 02:22:08,456
Not Europe.
Probably Latin America.

1516
02:22:08,529 --> 02:22:11,726
You think it over. Rest,
Avner. Then you come back.

1517
02:22:14,001 --> 02:22:15,025
No.

1518
02:22:41,995 --> 02:22:43,087
That's all right.

1519
02:22:43,163 --> 02:22:46,621
Oh, no, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay.

1520
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:49,863
Look at that beautiful hair.

1521
02:23:36,850 --> 02:23:38,215
Nightmares?

1522
02:23:39,353 --> 02:23:40,411
Yes.

1523
02:23:43,857 --> 02:23:45,449
Come back to bed.

1524
02:23:48,028 --> 02:23:50,394
I have no idea
where I should be.

1525
02:23:56,770 --> 02:24:01,230
The place is nice.
You've made it really nice.

1526
02:24:02,542 --> 02:24:04,407
The kitchen's too big.

1527
02:25:22,389 --> 02:25:25,017
Sylvie, I need to speak
to your father.

1528
02:25:27,127 --> 02:25:28,651
Is Louis there?

1529
02:25:30,330 --> 02:25:33,060
I need to speak to your
father. Have him call me.

1530
02:25:33,133 --> 02:25:36,933
212-664-7665.

1531
02:25:37,637 --> 02:25:40,105
I'll wait. He must call me.
I'll wait.

1532
02:25:44,344 --> 02:25:45,868
Am I being hunted?

1533
02:25:46,546 --> 02:25:48,173
<i>Is my family being hunted?</i>

1534
02:25:48,248 --> 02:25:53,208
How is your father? He's
well? Your family is well?

1535
02:25:53,353 --> 02:25:56,914
I don't know. How is my
family? Are they well?

1536
02:25:56,990 --> 02:25:58,355
Are they going to be okay?

1537
02:25:58,425 --> 02:26:01,121
I'm sending you a parcel
of sausage and cheese.

1538
02:26:01,261 --> 02:26:04,355
Real cheese. The kind
you can't find in America.

1539
02:26:04,498 --> 02:26:07,990
It isn't pasteurized,
so it won't taste like shit.

1540
02:26:09,336 --> 02:26:12,328
It's a real pleasure
to hear your voice again.

1541
02:26:13,473 --> 02:26:15,737
I think about you
with concern.

1542
02:26:16,209 --> 02:26:17,801
<i>Do you believe me?</i>

1543
02:26:19,846 --> 02:26:20,835
Avner?

1544
02:26:21,715 --> 02:26:23,580
You believe me, Avner?

1545
02:26:25,786 --> 02:26:27,447
You know my name?

1546
02:26:27,521 --> 02:26:29,045
Of course I do.

1547
02:26:30,724 --> 02:26:32,658
Now, listen to me.
It's important.

1548
02:26:34,060 --> 02:26:36,927
No harm will come to you
from me.

1549
02:27:01,922 --> 02:27:05,449
You can't go in there, sir.
It's a restricted area. Sir?

1550
02:27:06,159 --> 02:27:08,286
I tried to stop him.
I don't know who this guy is.

1551
02:27:08,361 --> 02:27:10,921
Security!

1552
02:27:12,232 --> 02:27:13,893
If you're Mossad,
you know who I am.

1553
02:27:13,967 --> 02:27:16,834
If you don't, tell Ephraim
Avner came to see him.

1554
02:27:16,903 --> 02:27:18,336
Being in this room
is by appointment only.

1555
02:27:18,438 --> 02:27:19,928
Shut up and listen to me.

1556
02:27:20,006 --> 02:27:22,531
I won't hesitate to kill
other people's children...

1557
02:27:22,609 --> 02:27:24,634
if you hurt my child.
Understand? Do I know you, sir?

1558
02:27:24,711 --> 02:27:27,805
Or wives if you hurt my wife,
or fathers if you hurt my father.

1559
02:27:27,881 --> 02:27:30,111
I don't care.
I'll go to the newspapers.

1560
02:27:30,183 --> 02:27:33,084
I'll give every name of
everybody who was in the meetings.

1561
02:27:33,153 --> 02:27:36,850
I'll tell them everything if you
don't leave my family alone! Okay?

1562
02:32:05,892 --> 02:32:07,257
I love you.

1563
02:32:32,118 --> 02:32:33,278
Avner.

1564
02:32:38,858 --> 02:32:40,348
Phone for you.

1565
02:32:40,894 --> 02:32:42,361
He's Israeli.

1566
02:32:47,300 --> 02:32:49,632
You think we'd hurt
your family?

1567
02:32:50,069 --> 02:32:52,663
I think anyone is capable
of anything.

1568
02:32:53,072 --> 02:32:55,404
I think you're losing
your mind.

1569
02:33:00,380 --> 02:33:02,143
Did I commit murder?

1570
02:33:05,351 --> 02:33:07,444
I want you to give me proof
that everyone we killed...

1571
02:33:07,520 --> 02:33:08,578
had a hand in Munich.

1572
02:33:08,655 --> 02:33:10,987
I don't discuss such things
with people who don't exist.

1573
02:33:11,057 --> 02:33:13,582
You want to discuss,
come back to existence.

1574
02:33:13,660 --> 02:33:15,685
You want your daughter
to grow up in exile?

1575
02:33:15,762 --> 02:33:17,354
I want evidence.

1576
02:33:21,067 --> 02:33:24,434
Professor Hamshari with the
beautiful wife and child?

1577
02:33:24,771 --> 02:33:28,070
He was implicated in a failed
assassination attempt on Ben-Gurion.

1578
02:33:28,141 --> 02:33:30,473
He was recruiting
for Fatah France.

1579
02:33:30,543 --> 02:33:31,840
You stopped him.

1580
02:33:31,911 --> 02:33:33,435
We should have tried
to bring him to Israel.

1581
02:33:33,513 --> 02:33:35,572
And Zwaiter, your harmless
little writer in Rome?

1582
02:33:35,648 --> 02:33:38,879
He was behind the bomb
on El Al flight 76 in 1968.

1583
02:33:39,018 --> 02:33:40,815
He was working on
another bomb last August.

1584
02:33:40,887 --> 02:33:41,979
I could go on
and on with this.

1585
02:33:42,055 --> 02:33:44,615
According to evidence
nobody has seen.

1586
02:33:44,691 --> 02:33:47,524
If these people committed crimes,
we should have arrested them.

1587
02:33:47,594 --> 02:33:49,084
Like Eichmann.

1588
02:33:49,596 --> 02:33:51,461
If these guys live,
Israelis die.

1589
02:33:51,531 --> 02:33:55,467
Whatever doubts you have,
Avner, you know this is true.

1590
02:34:05,111 --> 02:34:07,375
You did well,
but you're unhappy.

1591
02:34:07,447 --> 02:34:09,813
I killed seven men.
Not Salameh.

1592
02:34:10,650 --> 02:34:12,117
We'll get him, of course.

1593
02:34:15,388 --> 02:34:17,356
You think you were
the only team?

1594
02:34:17,991 --> 02:34:20,824
It's a big operation.
You were only a part.

1595
02:34:21,094 --> 02:34:22,891
Does that assuage your guilt?

1596
02:34:24,130 --> 02:34:26,030
Did we accomplish
anything at all?

1597
02:34:26,432 --> 02:34:29,196
Every man we killed
has been replaced by worse.

1598
02:34:29,269 --> 02:34:32,067
Why cut my fingernails?
They'll grow back.

1599
02:34:32,338 --> 02:34:34,806
Did we kill to replace
the terrorist leadership...

1600
02:34:34,874 --> 02:34:36,239
or the Palestinian leadership?

1601
02:34:36,309 --> 02:34:38,004
You tell me what we've done.

1602
02:34:38,077 --> 02:34:39,806
You killed them
for the sake of a country...

1603
02:34:39,879 --> 02:34:41,107
you now choose to abandon.

1604
02:34:42,615 --> 02:34:46,517
The country your mother and father
built, that you were born into.

1605
02:34:46,586 --> 02:34:49,282
You killed them for Munich,
for the future, for peace.

1606
02:34:51,124 --> 02:34:54,252
There's no peace at the end of
this, no matter what you believe.

1607
02:34:54,327 --> 02:34:57,524
You know this is true.
Here's what I know.

1608
02:34:57,730 --> 02:34:59,721
Your father is sick,
your mother will be alone.

1609
02:34:59,799 --> 02:35:02,996
You're a sabra. Your wife
and daughter are sabras.

1610
02:35:03,937 --> 02:35:06,132
What I came to say
is this...

1611
02:35:07,340 --> 02:35:08,671
come home.

1612
02:35:22,989 --> 02:35:24,957
Come to my house
for dinner tonight.

1613
02:35:26,793 --> 02:35:28,818
Come on. You're a
Jew, you're a stranger.

1614
02:35:28,895 --> 02:35:31,523
It's written someplace
or other that I'm meant to...

1615
02:35:31,597 --> 02:35:34,293
ask you to come
and break bread with me.

1616
02:35:34,867 --> 02:35:39,429
So break bread with me,
Ephraim.

1617
02:35:43,409 --> 02:35:44,467
No.

1618
02:36:29,409 --> 02:37:37,762
