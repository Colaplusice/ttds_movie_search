00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,800
If yet your blood does not rage, then
it is waterthat flows in your veins.

3
00:01:17,072 --> 00:01:21,237
For what is the flush of youth,
if it is not of service to the motherland.

4
00:01:58,882 --> 00:02:03,945
Just a minute Mr. McKinley,
one revolutionary is meeting another.

5
00:02:09,894 --> 00:02:12,020
Thank you.
Shall we go?

6
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:15,694
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

7
00:02:18,402 --> 00:02:22,098
This isn't the end Mr. McKinley.
This is just the beginning.

8
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,436
There will be others after
we have gone. Many others.

9
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:15,860
Shove it.

10
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:53,569
Get out of the way! Scoot!

11
00:08:53,774 --> 00:08:56,743
<i>You come India first time madam?
Yes!</i>

12
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:12,922
Sorry about the short notice.

13
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:17,086
Gosh! Your Hindi has
really improved.

14
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:19,763
Don't worry,
all the preparations are done.

15
00:09:33,814 --> 00:09:37,011
Hey Sue, no need to worry...

16
00:09:37,484 --> 00:09:41,546
...everything has been taken care of
posters have been put up everywhere.

17
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:43,289
It's also been announced on radio.

18
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:45,884
...just see, they'll be lining
up forthe auditions.

19
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,024
What's wrong?

20
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,701
I didn't tell you.
The truth is that I've come alone.

21
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:03,308
...no money, no producer is going to arrive.

22
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:05,810
You knew it!

23
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:12,384
After Alice, there was a
call from a certain Beth Williams...

24
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:16,313
...she informed me of the cancellation
of the show and also my services.

25
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:24,497
...did you abuse her in Hindi?

26
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:31,268
She wanted to know what it meant.
I explained to her in graphic detail.

27
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:38,605
You are amazing... Sonia.

28
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:06,030
This is Delhi University.
Let me help you with your luggage.

29
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:09,440
<i>How much?
- Ma'am I've already told you.</i>

30
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:16,446
Ravi, please get all the
luggage to our room.

31
00:11:41,612 --> 00:11:43,909
Get some rest now.
I'll see you tomorrow...

32
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:46,678
...lf you need anything
you have my number.

33
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:50,587
Let's go Ravi.

34
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,117
I can't do this.

35
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,854
I can't do this.

36
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:11,198
I deserve a role because
I have dimples just like Priety Zinta.

37
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:56,512
<i>Don't sing. Just recite "Vande Matram".
- Vande Matram?</i>

38
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:15,695
<i>Raise your hand and say VANDE MATRAM!
VANDE Matram!</i>

39
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:18,532
<i>Speak loudly, VANDE MATRAM!
Vande MATRAM.</i>

40
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,198
<i>Loudly and proudly, VANDE MATRAM!
Vande MATRAM</i>

41
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,708
<i>VANDE MATRAM!
Vande Matram...</i>

42
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:29,042
I have dedicated my life
to the freedom of this nation.

43
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:31,385
I have dedicated my life
to the freedom of this nation.

44
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,888
I know you want me to get married.

45
00:14:34,422 --> 00:14:37,550
...but FREEDOM is my bride.

46
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:41,393
I know... I know... that...

47
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,231
I know... that you want me to get married...

48
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:50,902
...but my bride is FREEDOM

49
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:57,234
...but my bride is FREEDOM.
Your obedient son, BHAGAT SINGH.

50
00:14:58,046 --> 00:14:58,740
BHAGAT SINGH.

51
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,905
Bhagat Singh.

52
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,745
Bhagat Singh.

53
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:06,754
My name is Bhagat Singh.

54
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:17,365
<i>Tea!
Thanks.</i>

55
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,098
Depressed huh?

56
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:27,201
One ortwo of them can
be used for minor roles...

57
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,610
...but no one's even close for
Azad or Bhagat Singh.

58
00:15:31,982 --> 00:15:35,042
I guess it's all my fault.

59
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:39,048
No Sonia. You're my rock.

60
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:44,555
Sue, don't get so dejected.

61
00:15:47,164 --> 00:15:49,462
Let's go and have some fun.
I'm in no mood Sonia.

62
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:18,324
Hey Aslam.

63
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:33,076
Aslam... Sue McKinley.

64
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:35,408
You too study at the University?

65
00:16:35,613 --> 00:16:37,410
Wow! Her Hindi is great.

66
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:43,080
We live there, eat there but no one
has ever accused us of studying there.

67
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:12,613
What are those maniacs upto?

68
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:14,619
That's DJ...

69
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,285
DJ I love you!!!

70
00:17:17,923 --> 00:17:18,891
That's Sukhi.

71
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,899
DJ I love you!!!

72
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:32,734
I love you too baby!

73
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:48,147
Damn exhibitionists.

74
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:51,653
The idiots will never change.

75
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:56,491
Come on dude, let's rock it!

76
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:02,995
Sukhi I love you!

77
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:29,560
Is he OK?

78
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:31,697
That's his natural state.

79
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:38,930
Sukhi, all parts working?

80
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,071
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

81
00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:48,575
Sue this is DJ.
DJ this is Sue.

82
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:49,374
Hi!

83
00:18:50,418 --> 00:18:54,218
Sue? She's so pink her name
should be Gulabo (Rose).

84
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:57,557
She's quite hot...

85
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,226
Perfect forthis cold.

86
00:19:03,431 --> 00:19:10,064
Karan you saved my life.
I love you!

87
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:12,068
Aslam...

88
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:14,572
...you too saved my life,

89
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:16,675
I love you too!

90
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:19,080
It's ok.

91
00:19:22,785 --> 00:19:24,582
She must have saved my life too...

92
00:19:24,786 --> 00:19:26,913
No! Sukhi!
She didn't save your life.

93
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:29,750
No problem. One day
she'll save my life.

94
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:36,031
Relax Dude!
She is your sister-in-law.

95
00:19:42,772 --> 00:19:47,903
LOOSE CONTROL

96
00:19:56,218 --> 00:20:10,122
I'm a REBEL.

97
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:16,302
<i>There's aren't any students here,
no teachers to suffer.</i>

98
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,982
<i>It's a school without rules out here
Hey Genius, go figure.</i>

99
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,327
Sukhi you just sit and
watch like a dumb-ass...

100
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,233
DJ doesn't waste a second.

101
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:47,767
He's a stud.

102
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:50,440
Hi! How's everybody?
Hi Rahul! What's up?

103
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,838
Got a few gigs lined up.

104
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,670
How's your radio thing going?

105
00:20:56,948 --> 00:20:57,675
Did anything work out?

106
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:00,014
All India Radio has
given me a night slot.

107
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:01,912
Cool...

108
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:07,248
Not really. When the whole world's
sleeping I'm on air.

109
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,255
But people stay up late...

110
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:13,758
Criminals, insomniacs,
watchmen and idiots!

111
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,931
Have yourfun at my expense.

112
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,527
Speaking of expenses...
Can I...

113
00:21:29,181 --> 00:21:31,375
See you guys.
Got a cigarette?

114
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,385
Fabulous!

115
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:42,390
It's my Dad's money.
He's got lots of it...

116
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,737
Stop this Western music,
this obscenity!

117
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,232
How many times do
I have to make you understand this!

118
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,407
Polluting the culture of this country...

119
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,906
Leave this place right now.
LEAVE!

120
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:06,415
Can't you understand, idiot!

121
00:22:07,654 --> 00:22:10,248
This is your last warning...

122
00:22:11,557 --> 00:22:16,017
...from now on, nobody plays
any Western music out here.

123
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,256
No lewd dancing!

124
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:24,528
Or I'll break your legs.

125
00:22:24,804 --> 00:22:27,773
Who are you to warn us?
If you don't like it, don't come here.

126
00:22:27,974 --> 00:22:29,942
You bloody Pakistani!

127
00:22:35,982 --> 00:22:38,280
Let's finish it.

128
00:22:56,837 --> 00:23:00,705
Last warning! Got it?

129
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:06,036
Long live India!

130
00:23:12,386 --> 00:23:16,220
You touch Aslam and
see what I do to you...

131
00:23:16,423 --> 00:23:18,483
...even your mother won't recognize you.

132
00:23:19,627 --> 00:23:23,290
Ever seen a baboons arse? Yours will
be as red after I've finished with you.

133
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:29,162
Sir, I'm sure we can work it out.

134
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:38,501
Keep this...

135
00:23:43,884 --> 00:23:48,015
Anyone hungry? I'm famished.

136
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:49,304
How're you?

137
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,408
Hey honey! Come here you...

138
00:25:56,854 --> 00:25:59,653
If something happened to you,
I'd have killed you.

139
00:26:00,024 --> 00:26:01,651
Is this any way to greet your boyfriend?

140
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:05,329
How're you?

141
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,573
Hurry guys, I'm famished.

142
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,339
You won't get any food here.

143
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,018
Stay away!

144
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,691
...I carried you in my stomach
for nine months...

145
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,520
...and washed your bum foryears.

146
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:37,920
Get lost!

147
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:41,694
Does anyone botherto check
if Mitro is alive or dead?

148
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,697
What's up?

149
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:44,702
You're drunk again.

150
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:47,699
No. No. No.

151
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,704
First give us food ma,
and then yell at us all night.

152
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:54,539
None of you have eaten?

153
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:58,045
Sonia you've lost even more weight.

154
00:26:58,251 --> 00:26:58,876
Really... Mitro

155
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:02,885
The girls of today have
more bones and less flesh...

156
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,716
How will you bear children?

157
00:27:08,595 --> 00:27:12,292
Aslam, how are you my son?

158
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:15,058
He is my true son
who bothers to check on me.

159
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:19,068
And you...

160
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:23,736
Look ma, what I brought foryou.

161
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:27,410
Your daughter-in-law.
Her name is Sue.

162
00:27:27,614 --> 00:27:30,242
What? Aforeigner?

163
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:34,685
Brought her especially from London.
That's why I was away for so long.

164
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:39,586
Give me your blessings Ma.

165
00:27:41,561 --> 00:27:43,587
Your son's such a brat.

166
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:50,092
God! She understands Hindi!

167
00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:57,607
<i>You really understand everything?
Yes.</i>

168
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:06,878
I'm going off to sleep. Your beds are
all ready. No need to drive so late at night.

169
00:28:46,695 --> 00:28:47,663
Sue, where are you?

170
00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:51,394
Will you guys act in my film?

171
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:52,659
What?

172
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,839
Hey, why are you guys laughing?
I'm the hero of herfilm.

173
00:29:02,044 --> 00:29:03,841
Yeah we guys are champions
when it comes to acting...

174
00:29:04,213 --> 00:29:06,010
...clowning around is all they do.

175
00:29:08,718 --> 00:29:11,949
The four of you will be
perfect forthe roles...

176
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:16,854
And Sonia will be my Durga Bhabhi.

177
00:29:17,226 --> 00:29:18,750
She really knows Hindi!

178
00:29:19,795 --> 00:29:22,696
All this talk of patriotism is boring.

179
00:29:22,898 --> 00:29:26,960
Boring? These guys gave their
lives forthe freedom of your country.

180
00:29:27,403 --> 00:29:29,871
What freedom? Have you seen
the state of this country?

181
00:29:31,574 --> 00:29:33,041
Excuse me! I believe in this country, Karan.

182
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:38,039
Otherwise, why would
I be fighting for it?

183
00:29:38,415 --> 00:29:42,373
Maybe because it's cool!
Being a pilot... flying an expensive plane.

184
00:29:42,753 --> 00:29:43,879
You get to wear sexy jackets...

185
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:48,217
And the women...
women love men in uniforms.

186
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:50,892
Sure I love being a pilot.
Sure it's cool.

187
00:29:51,061 --> 00:29:54,895
But I also feel proud of my country,
and I can give my life for it.

188
00:29:55,632 --> 00:29:58,726
Proud of what?

189
00:29:58,935 --> 00:29:59,993
...this country's exploding population?

190
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:02,230
...or unemployment...
or corruption?

191
00:30:02,606 --> 00:30:03,903
Which of these are you really proud of?

192
00:30:04,107 --> 00:30:08,010
No country's perfect Karan.
We've got to make it better.

193
00:30:08,211 --> 00:30:08,678
Right.

194
00:30:10,113 --> 00:30:13,140
Ok, Ajay you make
this country perfect.

195
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:17,248
The minute I get my degree
I'm out of this dump...

196
00:30:17,455 --> 00:30:19,923
You won't be able
to leave us and go.

197
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:22,587
She speaks Hindi so well!

198
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:30,827
Why didn't you tell me you idiot.
I was making a fool of myself.

199
00:30:37,075 --> 00:30:40,169
At least ask them once.

200
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:41,504
So you won't give up.

201
00:30:43,314 --> 00:30:46,614
Ok. But nobody will turn up.

202
00:30:47,485 --> 00:30:53,788
I'll get them. That's a promise.

203
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:00,298
Karan put your cigarette out.

204
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:04,458
Grandpa!

205
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:08,139
God bless you.
When did you come?

206
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:12,401
Just last night.

207
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:59,490
Good morning Karan.
Back so early?

208
00:32:01,594 --> 00:32:03,221
I didn't know you were in town.

209
00:32:04,764 --> 00:32:06,289
Just arrived an hour ago.

210
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:11,161
It was a long flight...
Everything Ok at college?

211
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,064
Everything's fine Dad.

212
00:32:13,274 --> 00:32:16,731
Have you decided which American
university you want to go to next year?

213
00:32:18,345 --> 00:32:23,612
Michigan, Carnegie,
Mellon, Wharton...

214
00:32:23,784 --> 00:32:24,750
I know the list.

215
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:30,586
Hello...

216
00:32:31,058 --> 00:32:31,922
Karan wait!

217
00:32:33,794 --> 00:32:38,254
I can't hearyou clearly
call me later.

218
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,525
I know that you know about the lists.

219
00:32:43,904 --> 00:32:45,872
But life doesn't just happen to you.

220
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:48,164
You've got to plan it...

221
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:52,006
Every second someone
is born in this country.

222
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:57,609
Nobody cares about them.
Neitherthe government nor God.

223
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:03,553
Do something.
Or else you will be one of them.

224
00:33:03,825 --> 00:33:05,622
Please, don't start with your lectures.

225
00:33:06,995 --> 00:33:10,954
SMS generation.
Any conversation that goes beyond...

226
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:12,292
...four lines becomes a lecture.

227
00:33:16,238 --> 00:33:20,641
Signal's weak here. Give me a second.
Excuse me Karan.

228
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:26,810
The deal is off then,
we are not interested...

229
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:33,816
You know Russian quality is doubtful,
they can't afford to be arrogant.

230
00:33:36,592 --> 00:33:40,961
Anyway in the open market they'd not get
anything close to the price we're offering.

231
00:33:41,097 --> 00:33:45,932
And you know how many fathers
there are to every deal in India. Nothing.

232
00:33:46,569 --> 00:33:56,342
Tell them we won't bargain,
they should wire the money to us.

233
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:24,339
I did try to warn you...
they won't turn up.

234
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:26,168
DJ promised me.

235
00:34:26,376 --> 00:34:28,241
Oh! DJ promised you!

236
00:34:28,577 --> 00:34:30,045
So you really are a filmmaker?

237
00:34:30,247 --> 00:34:33,273
Karan... Why are you so late?

238
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:35,885
And where are the others?

239
00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:43,053
The Young Guns Of India.
Very dramatic.

240
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,925
Where are you going?

241
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:51,692
Well that's one part cast.

242
00:34:52,135 --> 00:34:55,798
I am sure Karan can tell us
where his friends are.

243
00:35:10,455 --> 00:35:11,888
She's an eight. Yeah!

244
00:35:12,223 --> 00:35:13,087
Wow! Nine.

245
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:14,690
<i>What a girl!
Oye Chotu...</i>

246
00:35:14,892 --> 00:35:16,621
...get me a cup of tea...

247
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:18,557
Two, looks like she's got the flu...

248
00:35:21,899 --> 00:35:22,524
Six...

249
00:35:23,435 --> 00:35:26,835
Ten!
What?

250
00:35:29,074 --> 00:35:32,373
Dude... Iooks at those legs!

251
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:36,548
Shake it baby, shake it...

252
00:35:37,149 --> 00:35:37,808
Oh shit!

253
00:35:38,016 --> 00:35:39,643
Don't be silly,
that's at least an eight.

254
00:35:39,852 --> 00:35:42,581
Thought I'd find you
stuffing yourfaces.

255
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:45,450
You lazy good-for-nothings.

256
00:35:45,891 --> 00:35:47,916
We were about to come... but...

257
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,094
...we are waiting for Karan actually.

258
00:35:50,529 --> 00:35:51,860
<i>Oh! So you were waiting for Karan.
Yeah!</i>

259
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:54,125
Karan was there on time.

260
00:35:55,968 --> 00:35:58,835
We are waiting for him here
and he was waiting for us there.

261
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:01,198
What confusion...

262
00:36:03,442 --> 00:36:05,138
You're Ashfaqulla Khan.

263
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,869
<i>You're Rajguru.
The hero right!</i>

264
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,480
And you know who you are?

265
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:12,409
The Master of Disguise
and Deception.

266
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:13,778
Chandrashekhar Azad.

267
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,151
What lips...

268
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:19,249
Learn the lines properly,
we meet tomorrow.

269
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:22,555
8 a.m. Sharp!

270
00:36:22,762 --> 00:36:25,026
<i>Nine.
Sharp at eight.</i>

271
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:28,029
<i>That's fine.
We've already wasted a day...</i>

272
00:36:33,807 --> 00:36:36,708
Aslam, your sister-in-law looks
even better when she's angry.

273
00:36:48,455 --> 00:36:49,615
What are you doing Laxman?

274
00:36:52,692 --> 00:36:53,989
Greetings Mishraji.

275
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:57,158
Party High Command is really
happy with your work.

276
00:36:57,665 --> 00:37:02,068
These demonstrations that you have
started against Western culture...

277
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,961
...they've helped us
overshadow other parties.

278
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:18,751
This is foryou.
And this is foryour boys.

279
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,549
It's not necessary, Mishraji.

280
00:37:21,956 --> 00:37:23,947
I'm not doing this for money.

281
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:27,019
I really believe in the
principles of my party.

282
00:37:27,963 --> 00:37:29,429
That's fine Laxman...

283
00:37:30,064 --> 00:37:35,970
...but every movement
needs fuel... Keep it.

284
00:37:58,126 --> 00:38:02,654
There is nothing
you can do to break me.

285
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,625
"Because I have made pain my friend."

286
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:09,931
"...As I hold Death's fingers."

287
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:25,377
DJ idiot, don't spoil my concentration.

288
00:38:29,759 --> 00:38:31,351
Look, Death's finger.

289
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:37,491
"I've committed my life
to the freedom of this country.

290
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,500
...I know you want me to get married,
but I have made freedom my bride..."

291
00:38:41,704 --> 00:38:44,172
"Your obedient son, Bhagat Singh."

292
00:38:45,942 --> 00:38:48,604
Who talks like this for
God's sake?

293
00:38:48,812 --> 00:38:50,506
My bride is freedom...

294
00:38:50,814 --> 00:38:53,214
I think it's a good line for Sukhi...

295
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:55,112
Since no girl is ever going to marry him...

296
00:38:55,351 --> 00:38:57,718
Let freedom be his bride.

297
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,355
Laugh bastards, laugh.

298
00:39:24,648 --> 00:39:26,980
This is the sari round
of the Miss Freedom contest.

299
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:30,579
Just thought it would help
me get into the character.

300
00:39:36,393 --> 00:39:38,555
Look guys this isn't going to work.

301
00:39:39,062 --> 00:39:43,362
You have to work hard to bring
out the characters.

302
00:39:44,034 --> 00:39:47,664
Unless you emote from within...

303
00:39:47,905 --> 00:39:49,600
...you won't understand these characters.

304
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:54,376
Try... it will come from within you.

305
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:56,046
BURP

306
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,272
See, he's got a hold of his character already.

307
00:39:59,517 --> 00:40:02,452
You understood the character pretty fast.

308
00:40:04,922 --> 00:40:07,892
See! Now you look like a revolutionary!

309
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,519
Whateveryou say Gulabo,
you need me to create the mood.

310
00:40:12,398 --> 00:40:14,195
DJ watch it.

311
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:18,190
Now she's upset!

312
00:40:23,409 --> 00:40:26,901
Those are the words of a 23 year old.

313
00:40:27,379 --> 00:40:30,542
That's how old Bhagat Singh
was when he died: 23.

314
00:40:31,116 --> 00:40:32,743
Those were different times Sue.

315
00:40:33,185 --> 00:40:38,384
Today, if you tell people that
you want to give your life foryour country...

316
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:39,946
...they'll call you nuts.

317
00:40:41,226 --> 00:40:41,988
Exactly.

318
00:40:43,495 --> 00:40:46,726
I don't think I can relate to this...

319
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:49,998
That's it. Don't think.

320
00:40:50,536 --> 00:40:55,064
Feel. Just read the words,
Feel them.

321
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,203
Why don't we try again?

322
00:40:58,777 --> 00:41:00,370
Let's try again...

323
00:41:02,448 --> 00:41:06,579
I've committed my life to
the freedom of this country.

324
00:41:08,822 --> 00:41:14,124
...a job... a well settled life...
these things don't matter anymore.

325
00:41:14,961 --> 00:41:24,029
...I know you want me to get married,
but I have made freedom my bride...

326
00:41:35,882 --> 00:41:41,548
I swear on Mother India...

327
00:41:55,336 --> 00:41:57,133
This Aslam is a real stud...

328
00:41:58,906 --> 00:42:04,209
Take a look at the packaging.
Poetry, palmistry!

329
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:09,879
DJ, I'm scared at times that
I'll remain a bachelor all my life.

330
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:15,354
Trust me I won't let you die a bachelor.

331
00:42:15,557 --> 00:42:16,182
Promise?

332
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:18,081
It's DJ's promise.

333
00:42:21,897 --> 00:42:27,494
You'll be writing people's destinies...

334
00:42:39,414 --> 00:42:41,177
Your love line is very strong...

335
00:42:42,218 --> 00:42:45,881
The man of your dreams will come
along in a black T-shirt and say:

336
00:42:51,226 --> 00:42:54,560
Do I even have a love line?

337
00:42:54,764 --> 00:42:56,527
You must have washed it off in the loo.

338
00:42:56,732 --> 00:43:02,227
"Defence Minister Shastri has also been
implicated in the MIG-21 kickbacks scandal,"

339
00:43:02,438 --> 00:43:06,373
This is really depressing.

340
00:43:06,576 --> 00:43:09,602
"This is a blatant lie.
I am ordering an investigation."

341
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:20,179
UTv

342
00:44:47,412 --> 00:44:48,539
See you guys.

343
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:52,477
You're my buddy...
I'll drop you home.

344
00:44:52,684 --> 00:44:55,586
I don't need any help,
it's just two lanes away.

345
00:44:56,221 --> 00:44:59,657
We aren't so drunk...
that we've forgotten where you live.

346
00:45:12,972 --> 00:45:14,132
Idiots!

347
00:45:15,874 --> 00:45:17,637
You're very lucky to
have friends like them.

348
00:45:23,682 --> 00:45:26,150
One day this will all end.

349
00:45:27,353 --> 00:45:29,150
We'll all go our separate ways.

350
00:45:30,256 --> 00:45:32,816
But you can always keep in touch.

351
00:45:33,759 --> 00:45:34,919
Doesn't happen.

352
00:45:36,128 --> 00:45:37,687
Life gets busy.

353
00:45:38,465 --> 00:45:41,662
Too many problems.
Getting a job, a house, money.

354
00:45:51,911 --> 00:45:55,347
In college we are the
masters of our destinies...

355
00:45:56,149 --> 00:45:58,344
But after college we have
to dance to fate's tune.

356
00:46:05,158 --> 00:46:10,791
You know Gulabo.
I passed out 5 years ago...

357
00:46:11,932 --> 00:46:13,455
...but I still hang around...

358
00:46:13,901 --> 00:46:15,959
I don't understand.

359
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:20,231
...I don't ever want to leave college.

360
00:46:21,308 --> 00:46:21,933
Why?

361
00:46:24,512 --> 00:46:28,915
At least in the campus
I'm someone... people know me.

362
00:46:30,084 --> 00:46:31,949
DJ's somebody...

363
00:46:34,321 --> 00:46:39,349
People expect me to do
something big in life.

364
00:46:41,796 --> 00:46:45,027
But when I'm out on the streets...

365
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:51,099
I'll just be like the rest of
the slobs in this country.

366
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:04,042
Nameless. Faceless. Scared.
Just walking the streets...

367
00:47:04,986 --> 00:47:08,513
It's the beer...
Everything came out.

368
00:47:12,627 --> 00:47:16,188
You know what else
I'm scared of?

369
00:47:17,899 --> 00:47:19,491
Acting in yourfilm.

370
00:47:21,169 --> 00:47:23,729
Don't worry... you're in safe hands.

371
00:47:44,459 --> 00:47:45,392
Where have you been?

372
00:47:47,029 --> 00:47:47,927
Hello Uncle... How are you?

373
00:47:53,202 --> 00:47:57,468
We'll catch up tomorrow Aslam...

374
00:48:04,914 --> 00:48:05,711
You've been drinking?

375
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:10,047
Dad, you know I don't drink.

376
00:48:10,486 --> 00:48:13,854
<i>Good-for-nothings...
Whatever, they're my friends.</i>

377
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,788
Friends! They feel no
shame standing in front of...

378
00:48:17,994 --> 00:48:20,759
...yourfather with alcohol on their breath.

379
00:48:21,097 --> 00:48:23,794
Why can't you get friends
in your own community?

380
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:27,937
Why do you make friends with people
who corrupt you, disgrace your religion...

381
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:29,833
This has nothing to
do with religion, Father.

382
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,841
Shut up! Don't raise your voice
in the presence of yourfather.

383
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:37,245
He's right.

384
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:44,613
This country has never accepted
Muslims and it never will...

385
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:46,622
How can you be so passive!

386
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,194
Do you ever see me
mixing with a Hindu?

387
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:55,997
I'm not you and I don't want
to be like you brother.

388
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:59,201
I can't fill myself with so much hate...

389
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:02,267
Coward that's what you are.

390
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:04,133
Stop it!

391
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:07,368
I feel suffocated in this house.
It's the same old thing every single day...

392
00:49:19,357 --> 00:49:22,383
Carnivals will be held on our
graves every year,

393
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:27,154
That's all that will be left of us,
when we die for our country.

394
00:49:27,366 --> 00:49:30,163
Well said Ashfaq Sahab...

395
00:49:30,668 --> 00:49:33,001
If the English could hearyou they
would leave this country in a moment.

396
00:49:35,374 --> 00:49:36,499
So what has been decided?

397
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:43,573
We'll steal the Empire's money
from the train that passes Kakori.

398
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:46,518
And with that money we will buy arms.

399
00:49:47,586 --> 00:49:49,781
Bismil will explain everything.

400
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:52,753
Yes Bismil... Where is my Ram?

401
00:49:55,594 --> 00:49:57,755
Ljust can't find my
Ramprasad Bismil.

402
00:49:57,963 --> 00:49:59,430
Relax. We will find him.

403
00:49:59,632 --> 00:50:01,224
But where? How?

404
00:50:01,533 --> 00:50:03,592
Very soon. Don't you wo...

405
00:50:06,071 --> 00:50:08,266
You won't get Ramprasad
Bismil out here.

406
00:50:09,508 --> 00:50:11,602
You need a true Indian.

407
00:50:12,544 --> 00:50:14,513
How can you find Indian
revolutionaries amongst...

408
00:50:15,282 --> 00:50:17,910
...people who want to be Westerners?

409
00:50:18,117 --> 00:50:19,551
Ignore him. Let's go.

410
00:50:19,753 --> 00:50:23,085
Ramprasad Bismil wished to
be reborn a hundred times...

411
00:50:25,191 --> 00:50:28,388
...so that he could give his life for his
country a hundred times over.

412
00:50:28,595 --> 00:50:29,823
Let's go Sue.

413
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:34,727
So where do you think
I can find my Bismil?

414
00:50:40,473 --> 00:50:41,633
I don't believe this.

415
00:50:44,778 --> 00:50:49,772
This day, we walk along with death,
and laugh at its pale spectre.

416
00:50:50,984 --> 00:50:56,581
We will not fearthose cruel swords,
our courage is far sharper.

417
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:05,730
Mistake not our silence for submission.
For beneath lies lava, molten.

418
00:51:08,436 --> 00:51:17,902
<i>O Martyre, O men of valour.
One day the enemy will sing your praises.</i>

419
00:51:18,813 --> 00:51:23,046
We will show our mettle
when the moment of truth arrives...

420
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:28,553
...for courage lives in deeds,
not boastful lies.

421
00:51:29,056 --> 00:51:32,719
We've gathered in the enemy's lair,
my friend...

422
00:51:32,928 --> 00:51:36,796
In the hope of dying for our motherland.

423
00:51:36,997 --> 00:51:41,628
We will not fearthose cruel swords,
our courage is far sharper.

424
00:51:41,837 --> 00:51:48,140
This day, we walk along with death,
and laugh at its pale spectre.

425
00:51:49,177 --> 00:51:55,343
We will not fearthose cruel swords,
our courage is far sharper.

426
00:52:07,062 --> 00:52:09,929
Sue, this isn't London.
You don't know what kind...

427
00:52:10,132 --> 00:52:11,156
...of scum, men like Laxman Pandey are.

428
00:52:11,366 --> 00:52:15,326
Look Sue if he is a part of this,
then I can't do the film.

429
00:52:15,537 --> 00:52:18,336
If you have any problems
with me say it on my face.

430
00:52:18,807 --> 00:52:22,767
Don't stab me in the back like a coward.

431
00:52:23,111 --> 00:52:25,773
Pandey leave!
We don't want trouble...

432
00:52:26,381 --> 00:52:28,782
Speak you coward.
What were you saying?

433
00:52:29,919 --> 00:52:32,649
Aslam, where are you going?

434
00:52:35,324 --> 00:52:36,256
Coward, what were you saying?

435
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,918
Hey you! How dare you hit Aslam?

436
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,368
SUKHI

437
00:52:51,942 --> 00:52:54,273
Thrash him.

438
00:53:14,765 --> 00:53:21,000
I'm sorry,
I took you guys in my film.

439
00:53:22,573 --> 00:53:24,940
God knows what made me come here...

440
00:54:42,288 --> 00:54:45,224
You know we've got a problem
with Pandey. There's a lot of bad blood.

441
00:54:45,424 --> 00:54:50,657
<i>And if I stay, it's sure to happen again.
No, Sue.</i>

442
00:54:50,964 --> 00:54:51,987
We've worked it out.

443
00:54:52,265 --> 00:54:53,788
You won't have any problems.

444
00:55:00,373 --> 00:55:05,868
Sue... we all know how much
this film means to you.

445
00:55:07,714 --> 00:55:10,808
We want to help you finish
what you came here to do.

446
00:55:13,219 --> 00:55:14,584
Everyone wants you to stay.

447
00:55:15,388 --> 00:55:16,582
I want you to stay.

448
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:25,991
Say something...

449
00:55:29,102 --> 00:55:31,764
Don't worry, you're in safe hands.

450
00:55:34,641 --> 00:55:36,802
Come on... Get up... Come here.

451
00:55:53,027 --> 00:55:55,962
She's not going anywhere.

452
00:56:00,835 --> 00:56:02,029
Now just chill.

453
00:57:38,735 --> 00:57:48,701
UTv

454
00:58:01,826 --> 00:58:15,330
<i>Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air...</i>

455
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:19,636
<i>Add the breath of my being,
the throbbing of my heart...</i>

456
00:58:19,843 --> 00:58:25,805
<i>And the zeal, that
races through my blood...</i>

457
00:58:26,184 --> 00:58:30,644
<i>Take all these, and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour...</i>

458
00:58:30,855 --> 00:58:35,155
<i>Take all these, and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour...</i>

459
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:39,821
<i>Watch as it brings out
the colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

460
00:58:42,367 --> 00:58:55,679
<i>Watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

461
00:59:08,727 --> 00:59:10,524
Bismil's sent a message...

462
00:59:10,729 --> 00:59:12,026
...that the Lucknow train...

463
00:59:13,065 --> 00:59:16,523
...carrying the Empire's money...
will be looted by us in Kakori...

464
00:59:16,902 --> 00:59:18,529
...while eating Kakori kababs.

465
00:59:19,238 --> 00:59:22,537
And we will buy bombs with that money.

466
00:59:22,742 --> 00:59:25,539
Leave her alone...
She will stop giving milk.

467
00:59:25,744 --> 00:59:29,373
<i>Give colour to your dreams.
And those of your people.</i>

468
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:34,379
<i>Give colour to your happiness.
And your sadness too.</i>

469
00:59:34,754 --> 00:59:38,712
<i>Give colour to generations...
Give colour to the field...</i>

470
00:59:39,425 --> 00:59:41,724
<i>Give colour to the beat of your heart.
And that of your music.</i>

471
00:59:41,927 --> 00:59:44,055
<i>Give colour to every cheek.
Give colour to your eyes...</i>

472
00:59:44,264 --> 00:59:46,391
<i>Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism my friend.</i>

473
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,397
<i>Watch as it brings out the colour...</i>

474
00:59:49,435 --> 00:59:58,003
<i>Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air...</i>

475
00:59:58,245 --> 01:00:02,739
<i>Add the breath of my being,
the throbbing of my heart.</i>

476
01:00:02,949 --> 01:00:08,751
<i>And the zeal, that races
through my blood.</i>

477
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:13,589
<i>Take all these and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

478
01:00:13,961 --> 01:00:18,090
<i>Take all these and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

479
01:00:18,299 --> 01:00:20,927
<i>Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

480
01:00:21,134 --> 01:00:22,762
<i>Watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

481
01:00:27,941 --> 01:00:28,840
Hey Short-stuff!

482
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:30,609
Did you get Bismil's message?

483
01:00:30,811 --> 01:00:32,108
<i>No.
No! Then Listen...</i>

484
01:00:32,313 --> 01:00:35,612
The train that's Kakori...
will be looted in eight days.

485
01:00:36,317 --> 01:00:37,944
It's loaded with the Empire's money.

486
01:00:38,152 --> 01:00:39,619
Will you loot it?
No.

487
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,947
We will be buying arms from it.

488
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:43,957
<i>What will we buy?
Arms...</i>

489
01:00:44,158 --> 01:00:45,455
Yes... Very Good... go now.

490
01:00:45,826 --> 01:00:49,785
<i>On a slow fire, won't you,
put this passion to cook.</i>

491
01:00:50,231 --> 01:00:54,793
<i>Then as it simmers,
add a babbling brook.</i>

492
01:00:55,037 --> 01:01:00,634
<i>Add a river, and an ocean.
Maybe a pot of water.</i>

493
01:01:00,841 --> 01:01:04,300
<i>Then sprinkle a bit. Stir it all up.
And watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

494
01:01:04,513 --> 01:01:08,973
<i>Watch as it brings out
the colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

495
01:01:10,686 --> 01:01:11,983
Bismil has sent a message...

496
01:01:13,021 --> 01:01:14,488
...the Lucknow train...

497
01:01:14,689 --> 01:01:16,317
...which carries the Empire's money...

498
01:01:16,692 --> 01:01:19,160
...will be looted by us in
seven days, in Kakori...

499
01:01:20,262 --> 01:01:22,162
And we will buy bombs with that money.

500
01:01:22,431 --> 01:01:26,231
<i>Now paint the whole town with it.
Paint your very being.</i>

501
01:01:26,868 --> 01:01:30,827
<i>Paint your every vein with it.
Paint it with a smile.</i>

502
01:01:31,541 --> 01:01:35,500
<i>Paint those childhood years, won't you.
Paint the flush of youth.</i>

503
01:01:36,211 --> 01:01:40,671
<i>Don't hesitate, my friend.
Paint your patriotism over everything.</i>

504
01:01:40,883 --> 01:01:45,182
<i>Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

505
01:01:45,888 --> 01:01:50,188
<i>Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air.</i>

506
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:59,161
<i>Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air.</i>

507
01:01:59,268 --> 01:02:04,001
<i>Add the breath of my being,
the throbbing of my heart.</i>

508
01:02:04,407 --> 01:02:09,868
<i>And the zeal,
that races through my blood.</i>

509
01:02:10,413 --> 01:02:14,714
<i>Take all these and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

510
01:02:15,085 --> 01:02:19,545
<i>Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

511
01:02:22,092 --> 01:02:34,903
<i>Watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

512
01:03:08,973 --> 01:03:16,607
<i>Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

513
01:03:48,447 --> 01:03:50,347
British Officers...
around 20 to 25 of them.

514
01:03:51,217 --> 01:03:54,516
We have to call it off! We've nearly
reached Kakori. Stop Ashfaq, quick.

515
01:04:03,396 --> 01:04:04,362
Ashfaq, stop!

516
01:04:07,399 --> 01:04:09,196
It's too late to back out now...
Come on... Move!

517
01:04:26,753 --> 01:04:27,378
Get inside!

518
01:04:41,735 --> 01:04:43,464
Keep the windows shut...

519
01:04:45,939 --> 01:04:46,564
Come on!

520
01:04:47,774 --> 01:04:48,241
The keys!

521
01:04:48,775 --> 01:04:50,073
You won't get away with this.

522
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:53,070
<i>Give me the keys!
- I don't have it.</i>

523
01:04:53,613 --> 01:04:55,081
Banwari get the sledge hammer.

524
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,249
I'll handle them.
You go get the money...

525
01:07:20,431 --> 01:07:22,899
I've committed my life
to the freedom of this country.

526
01:07:24,268 --> 01:07:28,568
Comfort, and other worldly
desires do not attract me.

527
01:07:29,773 --> 01:07:33,573
I know you want me to
get married and settle down...

528
01:07:33,944 --> 01:07:36,071
...like all parents do.

529
01:07:36,448 --> 01:07:38,415
But freedom is my bride.

530
01:07:40,451 --> 01:07:45,913
I hope you'll forgive me.
Your most obedient son, Bhagat.

531
01:07:52,296 --> 01:07:52,921
Let's take a break.

532
01:07:57,969 --> 01:08:01,268
Breakfast?
No...

533
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:22,285
Put it there.

534
01:08:22,495 --> 01:08:27,626
General Dyer? How can one even think
of doing something like this?

535
01:08:30,503 --> 01:08:34,963
I can't believe that he actually killed more
than 400 people at Jallianwala Baugh.

536
01:08:35,174 --> 01:08:37,472
379... that was the official figure.

537
01:08:38,177 --> 01:08:40,475
Actually nearly 1000
people were butchered...

538
01:08:48,187 --> 01:08:53,990
Last year at the tomb of Peer Sai,
I prayed for Daljeet's well being.

539
01:08:54,527 --> 01:08:55,653
Who's Daljeet?

540
01:08:55,862 --> 01:08:57,989
We were the epitome of tolerance.

541
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:04,000
Even an ant reacts. But we are conditioned
to take everything lying down.

542
01:09:04,771 --> 01:09:07,500
Rubbish! It's today's generation
which lacks the will to do anything

543
01:09:07,707 --> 01:09:09,334
Have you ever heard of
Shaheed Uddham Singh?

544
01:09:09,876 --> 01:09:13,505
He went all the way to London
and killed that Dyer.

545
01:09:14,047 --> 01:09:17,016
...because he was also a part
of the Jallianwala Baugh massacre.

546
01:09:17,551 --> 01:09:21,180
Eat it Sonia.
The butter will strengthen your bones.

547
01:09:21,555 --> 01:09:25,514
In Punjab every mother sends
at least one son to the army.

548
01:09:25,726 --> 01:09:28,694
Why should we retreat?
Sacrifice runs in our blood.

549
01:09:28,896 --> 01:09:31,693
Only idiots like DJ retreat.

550
01:09:31,898 --> 01:09:33,525
Why does it always come back to me?

551
01:09:33,733 --> 01:09:36,532
Shut up and eat your paratha.

552
01:09:36,803 --> 01:09:39,363
What is the most used word in this country?
ADJUST!

553
01:09:39,906 --> 01:09:44,367
Six people sitting on a seat forfour... someone
will squeeze in and say - 'Please adjust! '.

554
01:09:48,249 --> 01:09:55,382
Hey! Why are you adjusting?

555
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:00,558
Strange. Isn't it?

556
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:07,891
We are being hunted like
animals in our own country...

557
01:10:10,771 --> 01:10:13,569
...Ashfaq you should cross the border
and get to Afghanistan...

558
01:10:14,609 --> 01:10:18,068
...We have many Muslim friends there.
You will be safe with them.

559
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:20,081
After all, you're one of their own.

560
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:22,413
One of their own?
Hmm...

561
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:24,411
Why don't you think of me
as one of your own?

562
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:29,749
Ashfaq... I never meant...

563
01:10:31,793 --> 01:10:32,418
...Ashfaq...

564
01:10:35,964 --> 01:10:38,091
I didn't mean to hurt you.

565
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:42,103
This is your country as much as it is mine.

566
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:46,938
You have a right to fight and die for it too...

567
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:50,273
...Forgive me.

568
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,106
Ram, let us not talk of dying...

569
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:57,784
I pray, that we all live to see
our grandchildren grow up in a free country.

570
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:03,451
Ram run!

571
01:12:19,069 --> 01:12:20,867
Where are your otherfriends?

572
01:12:21,739 --> 01:12:23,207
Where's Azad?

573
01:13:12,625 --> 01:13:13,420
Banwari!

574
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:28,999
I loved those songs and dances.
Do they happen in yourfilms?

575
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:32,897
That's the reason we grow trees
in this country... to dance around them.

576
01:14:38,012 --> 01:14:40,480
So where are we going?

577
01:14:43,351 --> 01:14:45,979
<i>Special day, special place!
Special DAY?</i>

578
01:16:01,764 --> 01:16:05,723
Ever since I was a kid
I used to come here...

579
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:11,737
...to watch planes take off... and watch them
till they don't disappear in the sky.

580
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:17,914
What the hell are they doing?

581
01:16:44,476 --> 01:16:45,738
I don't believe them.

582
01:16:45,876 --> 01:16:46,433
Men!

583
01:16:46,978 --> 01:16:49,275
Come on, face it,
you'd love to do that really.

584
01:16:49,447 --> 01:16:51,744
What? Take my shirt off
and howl at planes.

585
01:16:51,983 --> 01:16:53,780
I won't mind if you do.

586
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:55,945
Dream on buddy...

587
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:07,795
Boys and girls
and Sukhi...

588
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:09,125
Why me all the time?

589
01:17:09,367 --> 01:17:10,800
I want to make a special announcement...

590
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:16,296
I was wondering if you'd like
to spend the rest of your life with me...

591
01:17:17,175 --> 01:17:21,135
...that's in case you aren't
doing anything important...

592
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,809
Will you please marry me?

593
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:29,172
<i>Without saying a word,
you steal my heart.</i>

594
01:18:29,582 --> 01:18:44,395
<i>I'll find happiness by your side
I can't stay apart</i>

595
01:18:46,766 --> 01:19:17,292
<i>My life tastes sweet now,
since you walked through that door.</i>

596
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:32,599
<i>When your arms wrap around me,
I know I've found my shore.</i>

597
01:19:34,813 --> 01:19:48,784
<i>Without saying a word,
you steal my heart.</i>

598
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:32,497
<i>Sweep through the streets of my mind
like a gentle spring.</i>

599
01:20:34,372 --> 01:20:48,116
<i>Walk through the corridors of my heart,
fill the caravan of my dreams.</i>

600
01:20:49,253 --> 01:21:04,601
<i>I sway to the song
of your soul.</i>

601
01:21:06,437 --> 01:21:20,875
<i>Without saying a word,
you steal my heart.</i>

602
01:21:21,419 --> 01:21:36,562
<i>I'll find happiness by your side,
I can't stay apart.</i>

603
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,650
I'll come back later.

604
01:22:03,861 --> 01:22:09,094
My prayers won't stop till
my country gets its freedom.

605
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,660
I don't think you can wait till then.

606
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:20,202
My name is James McKinley. I'm here
to find out from you...

607
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:24,607
...where Azad and
the otherterrorists are hiding.

608
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:31,880
Not terrorists.
Revolutionaries.

609
01:23:57,173 --> 01:24:04,204
On this day, we walk with death
and laugh at its pale spectre.

610
01:24:05,615 --> 01:24:14,216
Death cannot take you Ashfaq,
when you live in people's hearts and minds.

611
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:32,002
This is the Holy Quran.

612
01:24:33,609 --> 01:24:38,238
Hindus like Bismil will create
a country forthemselves.

613
01:24:38,447 --> 01:24:40,916
What will a Muslim like you get
out of it? They're just using you.

614
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:45,812
He's not fighting for Hindu freedom,
he's fighting for Hindustan's freedom.

615
01:24:47,289 --> 01:24:50,088
But you won't be
able to understand this.

616
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:54,418
You've been a slave so
long you've begun to like it.

617
01:24:59,635 --> 01:25:02,364
Tell us where Azad
and the otherterrorists are...

618
01:25:03,806 --> 01:25:06,501
...You can still
save yourself.

619
01:25:15,984 --> 01:25:17,281
19 December.

620
01:25:17,986 --> 01:25:20,386
It's not yourfault...

621
01:25:21,157 --> 01:25:23,624
...you're only doing your duty.

622
01:27:24,445 --> 01:27:25,639
Whats wrong?
Did someone die?

623
01:27:27,948 --> 01:27:31,850
Sue... I haven't seen
these guys so serious.

624
01:27:32,786 --> 01:27:34,515
What are you doing
to my friends?

625
01:27:35,122 --> 01:27:40,082
It's not me... it's them.
They've really begun to get into this.

626
01:27:41,128 --> 01:27:43,323
Hey Laxman, aren't
you coming along?

627
01:27:43,797 --> 01:27:45,094
No. Some othertime.

628
01:27:45,299 --> 01:27:46,766
Come on. It's my
last night in town.

629
01:27:47,801 --> 01:27:49,268
I'm not really hungry.

630
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:52,598
Watch us eat then.
Come on.

631
01:27:54,475 --> 01:27:56,272
Come on...

632
01:28:08,822 --> 01:28:17,457
To two lovebirds with the most insanely
romantic engagement in the whole wide world...

633
01:28:24,171 --> 01:28:26,570
I'm insane only about
two things in my life.

634
01:28:26,839 --> 01:28:30,036
Sonia and flying.

635
01:28:38,018 --> 01:28:42,818
You're lucky to feel so
passionately about something.

636
01:28:43,523 --> 01:28:45,150
You have your
poetry Aslam.

637
01:28:45,858 --> 01:28:47,656
Just like DJ has his singing.

638
01:28:48,528 --> 01:28:51,156
Everyone has passion for something inside
them, they just have to find this 'thing'.

639
01:28:51,698 --> 01:28:53,325
Just like our
revolutionaries...

640
01:28:53,533 --> 01:28:56,992
...their passion forfreedom was greater
than their love fortheir own lives.

641
01:28:57,203 --> 01:29:02,402
There's nothing in this world
worth giving your life for. Nothing!

642
01:29:07,046 --> 01:29:08,605
Repeat.

643
01:29:08,815 --> 01:29:09,839
Easy DJ...

644
01:29:10,049 --> 01:29:11,414
Yes mama.

645
01:29:13,219 --> 01:29:15,187
There are things worth
giving your life for Karan.

646
01:29:15,388 --> 01:29:16,855
Please.

647
01:29:17,224 --> 01:29:20,021
Like what? Look at Bhagat Singh and
Azad and the rest of those guys.

648
01:29:20,226 --> 01:29:22,194
They gave their lives
forthis country.

649
01:29:22,562 --> 01:29:24,962
Look what happened.
All for nothing.

650
01:29:25,898 --> 01:29:29,698
It's a shit-hole today.

651
01:29:31,571 --> 01:29:32,538
I give a shit.

652
01:29:33,072 --> 01:29:36,872
People like Ajay who fight for
their country give a shit.

653
01:29:37,076 --> 01:29:39,442
So that people like you
can sleep peacefully.

654
01:29:41,247 --> 01:29:43,875
Sonia get real.

655
01:29:44,083 --> 01:29:45,050
Sonia's right.

656
01:29:45,251 --> 01:29:49,210
Sue, it's all-fine for a
foreigner like you to say all this...

657
01:29:49,422 --> 01:29:52,880
Out here we're
fighting for basics.

658
01:29:53,092 --> 01:29:55,890
...food, clothing
and shelter.

659
01:29:56,095 --> 01:29:59,724
Out here you try to change things
you'll get even more screwed.

660
01:30:00,266 --> 01:30:02,894
Corruption is in our DNA.

661
01:30:04,270 --> 01:30:05,897
There is no future
forthis country.

662
01:30:06,105 --> 01:30:10,474
She's talking about the past,
you're thinking about the future...

663
01:30:10,777 --> 01:30:13,075
One leg in the past and
one leg in the future,

664
01:30:13,278 --> 01:30:14,906
that's why we're pissing
on the present...

665
01:30:17,449 --> 01:30:19,008
For once in
life get serious.

666
01:30:23,623 --> 01:30:28,423
Karan, it's easy to sit on
the outside and be a critic...

667
01:30:29,628 --> 01:30:31,688
...blaming others is
even easier.

668
01:30:33,466 --> 01:30:36,923
Why don't you go out
there and change things?

669
01:30:37,136 --> 01:30:38,103
Take a stand.

670
01:30:39,137 --> 01:30:43,268
Join politics, the police force,
government and clean it up.

671
01:30:44,309 --> 01:30:46,710
But you won't!
I'll tell you why...

672
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:56,944
Because that takes hard work.
It's easierto crib.

673
01:30:58,256 --> 01:30:59,382
Nothing's going to change.

674
01:30:59,926 --> 01:31:04,055
You can go to your grave trying...
it won't make any difference.

675
01:31:04,262 --> 01:31:09,222
Correct... the only difference
will be how you go to your grave...

676
01:31:13,505 --> 01:31:18,636
I'm not drunk. Am
I drunk Sue?

677
01:31:21,179 --> 01:31:25,081
See, the director's word
is final. Cut it!

678
01:31:28,019 --> 01:31:30,988
Where were we?

679
01:31:36,628 --> 01:31:39,620
On the way to our graves.

680
01:31:40,432 --> 01:31:43,868
We'll all be wrapped in
white shrouds when we die.

681
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:47,962
Only Ajay will be wrapped
in the national flag.

682
01:31:49,741 --> 01:31:52,801
Karan, you can say
whateveryou want,

683
01:31:53,545 --> 01:31:56,571
not even the street dogs
will bark when we die.

684
01:31:58,350 --> 01:32:04,151
But Ajay will get
a 21 gun salute.

685
01:32:42,326 --> 01:32:44,386
Karan, this is foryou.

686
01:32:44,629 --> 01:32:46,256
For me?
Thanks dude.

687
01:32:46,865 --> 01:32:48,764
The girls fall for him anyway...

688
01:32:48,966 --> 01:32:50,058
If anyone deserves
the jacket, it's me.

689
01:32:50,267 --> 01:32:55,205
Wow! What a dutiful
daughter-in-law.

690
01:32:55,572 --> 01:32:58,337
Come on, touch your
fiance's feet.

691
01:32:59,443 --> 01:33:01,673
DJ's right.
Touch my feet, madam.

692
01:33:04,915 --> 01:33:08,578
See what women in this
country have to put up with?

693
01:33:08,786 --> 01:33:12,722
I think DJ's right. You should
respect yourtraditions.

694
01:33:12,923 --> 01:33:14,185
See, even Sue agrees...

695
01:33:14,425 --> 01:33:17,917
...a woman's place is at
her husband's feet.

696
01:33:26,370 --> 01:33:27,962
These two can
be such children.

697
01:33:28,172 --> 01:33:31,505
They spend half theirtime fighting.
The other half making up.

698
01:33:32,209 --> 01:33:34,905
Sweetie-pie, can't you
stay a while longer?

699
01:33:35,479 --> 01:33:38,846
No, I have to go...

700
01:33:39,183 --> 01:33:40,616
SWEETIE -PIE!

701
01:33:44,621 --> 01:33:45,713
Shut up guys.

702
01:33:50,827 --> 01:33:52,386
Shut up yaar...
Ma will hear everything.

703
01:33:55,032 --> 01:33:58,024
I know how Sonia must
be feeling right now...

704
01:33:58,235 --> 01:33:59,725
...my father was also
in the army.

705
01:34:00,204 --> 01:34:02,365
I used to think that way too...

706
01:34:03,273 --> 01:34:05,797
...when Ajay's father and
I first got married.

707
01:34:06,543 --> 01:34:09,739
But then you realize something about
being an Air-force pilot's wife.

708
01:34:10,179 --> 01:34:15,015
You realize that your husband has
pledged his life forthe country.

709
01:34:16,419 --> 01:34:22,119
The least you can do for him, is control
your emotions. Not be weak.

710
01:34:30,033 --> 01:34:35,699
I'm so happy Ajay's
chosen a girl like you...

711
01:34:35,906 --> 01:34:37,736
...now I can die in peace.

712
01:34:37,941 --> 01:34:38,566
Don't talk nonsense Ma.

713
01:34:38,775 --> 01:34:43,179
You'll have many more years...
...and a dozen grandchildren too.

714
01:34:43,446 --> 01:34:46,074
Grandchildren? First you've got to stay
home long enough to make them, dude.

<i>And in our hearts, we feel the swell,
of pride and steel and valour.</i>

<i>For we will play the game of blood,
if dark clouds shroud our land.</i>

01:35:38,568 --> 01:35:43,904
<i>Because this day, we walk with death,
and laugh at its pale spectre.</i>

01:35:49,946 --> 01:35:54,474
<i>We will not fear those cruel swords,
our courage is far sharper.</i>

<i>We will not lower, in the face of threats,

<i>We will not lower, in the face of threats,

<i>For let them know, their cowardly deeds,
just serve to stoke our fires.</i>

725

<i>Because this day, we walk with death,
and laugh at its pale spectre.</i>

726
01:36:35,223 --> 01:36:39,786
<i>We bade farewell, to this day,
knowing it could be our last.</i>

<i>We swore to play, with our lives,
never waver in our task.</i>

728

<i>For we are but the last, few guests,
served at fate's great banquet.</i>

729
01:36:50,005 --> 01:36:57,138
<i>We cannot quell, the raging storm,
the spirit of revolution.</i>

730
01:36:57,345 --> 01:36:59,643
<i>For it now courses in our veins,
like lava truly molten.</i>

731
01:37:00,015 --> 01:37:04,645
<i>We will teach them, the twin lessons,
of fear and fortitude.</i>

732
01:37:04,853 --> 01:37:09,313
<i>Our goal cannot now hide for long,
when courage is our beacon.</i>

733

<i>Because this day, we walk with death,
and laugh at its pale spectre.</i>

734
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:41,488
We have to take drastic measures.

735
01:37:42,524 --> 01:37:43,320
What drastic measures?

736
01:37:46,494 --> 01:37:47,517
Kill him.

737
01:38:10,684 --> 01:38:11,309
Com'on.

738
01:38:38,712 --> 01:38:42,011

"Long live the revolution".

forthe Indian freedom movement.

01:39:28,762 --> 01:39:30,525
Great idea!

744
01:39:30,864 --> 01:39:32,923
But Bhagat, escaping
will be impossible.

745
01:39:33,133 --> 01:39:34,122
Our main mission is
to get caught...

746
01:39:34,968 --> 01:39:37,299
...not escape.

747
01:39:37,504 --> 01:39:38,061
What?

748
01:39:39,139 --> 01:39:42,267
If we get caught there
will be a trial...

749
01:39:43,009 --> 01:39:44,671
...we'll get a chance
to speak.

750
01:39:45,546 --> 01:39:46,535
We'll be heard.

751
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:56,884
But if they catch us,
they'll hang us for certain.

752
01:39:57,290 --> 01:39:57,949
I know.

753
01:40:00,394 --> 01:40:03,830
But it takes a loud noise
to open deaf ears.

754
01:40:10,938 --> 01:40:13,771
LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION!

755
01:40:16,676 --> 01:40:18,508

We are political prisoners...

...writing material...

766

...and at least one
daily newspaper.

767
01:41:32,051 --> 01:41:35,316
We will not eat till then.
The hunger strike will continue.

<i>Our words won't falter now,
We will speak our mind.</i>

01:44:27,157 --> 01:44:31,457
...a MIG-21 fighter plane
has just crashed...

786
01:44:31,762 --> 01:44:34,822
...this is the second such crash
in the past six months...

787
01:44:35,099 --> 01:44:38,626
The Defence Ministry has ordered
an investigation into the crash.

788
01:44:39,003 --> 01:44:42,029
We have just received
news that the pilot...

789
01:44:42,272 --> 01:44:46,003
...Flight Lieutenant Ajay Rathod
has died in the crash.

790
01:44:47,578 --> 01:44:50,979
Flight Lt Rathod apparently did not
eject from the burning plane...

791
01:44:51,181 --> 01:44:57,211
Instead he steered it away from Ambala
city and crashed it in an open field.

792
01:44:57,421 --> 01:44:58,581
Thus saving many lives

793
01:44:59,590 --> 01:45:00,955
Viewers may recall...

794
01:45:01,158 --> 01:45:05,254

163 MiG-21 of IAF have crashed...

No one to cut my strings, no more.</i>

806
01:47:42,651 --> 01:47:48,283
Flt. Lt. Ajay Rathod stayed in
the plane until the very end...

807
01:47:48,624 --> 01:47:52,787
...and steered the plane
clear of Ambala city.

Thereby saving

809
01:48:02,471 --> 01:48:06,907
In the last 10 years over 100 MIG-21
aircrafts of the IAF have crashed...

810
01:48:07,108 --> 01:48:10,942
...in which over 30 pilots have
lost their lives.

811
01:48:11,247 --> 01:48:18,709
Defence Minister, CAG report says old & defective
Russian spare parts were procured by the govt.

812
01:48:18,854 --> 01:48:21,857
Isn't this a case of
high-level corruption?

813
01:48:21,857 --> 01:48:27,454
Not at all. I've personally clarified
the issue in parliament.

814
01:48:27,929 --> 01:48:29,590
This is a downright lie.

815
01:48:29,998 --> 01:48:32,933
The youngsters of today are brash and
irresponsible when it comes to flying planes.

816
01:48:33,134 --> 01:48:35,159
No! I don't agree...

817
01:48:35,637 --> 01:48:38,105
Flt. Lt. Ajay Rathod
was an ace pilot...

818
01:48:38,306 --> 01:48:40,001
...who I trained...

819
01:48:40,408 --> 01:48:44,367
He was a gold medallist.
The youngest to clear night sorties.

820
01:48:44,579 --> 01:48:47,139
With over 1000 flying hours...

821
01:48:47,582 --> 01:48:50,449
This can't be the record
of an irresponsible pilot.

822
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:56,419
Defence Minister, how many
more pilots will you send to their graves...

823
01:48:56,625 --> 01:49:04,327

rot in the system?

01:49:46,407 --> 01:49:51,606
<i>when Ma, I don't have you.</i>

832
01:49:51,813 --> 01:49:54,280
From now on, the government
will make sure that...

833
01:49:55,182 --> 01:50:00,143
...only experienced pilots are given
access to these machines...

834
01:50:00,754 --> 01:50:06,954

like Ajay Rathod.

What the hell is
he talking about!

Relax Sir. Public memory is short.
Besides, we'll handle things.

Dead pilots, live very
long in the news.

But then, they join the forces to
sacrifice their lives. Don't they?

The situation is tense
at the moment.

There is growing anger

Especially the Defence Minister.

Ajay Rathod's mother...

845
01:52:03,276 --> 01:52:05,471
The government can't wash its
hands off the issue like this.

846
01:52:06,312 --> 01:52:08,678
They are answerable
to the public.

847
01:52:09,449 --> 01:52:14,978
If the MIG spare parts were of doubtful quality,
why were they bought in the first place?

848
01:52:15,354 --> 01:52:25,229
For what? Money?
Money won't bring our children back.

849
01:52:28,201 --> 01:52:32,570
The Defence Minister
is morally responsible.

850
01:52:33,072 --> 01:52:34,733
He has to resign.

851
01:52:35,041 --> 01:52:38,670
It looks like the veil has been
pulled off the defence scam.

852
01:52:38,878 --> 01:52:42,041
But how much
will be revealed?

853
01:52:42,248 --> 01:52:45,342
Mishra,
what's happening?

854
01:53:02,502 --> 01:53:05,335
Ajay Rathod was
not a novice...

855
01:53:05,538 --> 01:53:08,939
...he didn't let his plane
crash into the town.

856
01:53:09,642 --> 01:53:16,206
When it developed a snag
he didn't try to save his life.

857
01:53:17,016 --> 01:53:23,011
He steered it clear of Ambala
...saving thousands of civilians.

858
01:53:23,222 --> 01:53:30,025
Yet the Defence Minister
calls him rash.

859
01:53:48,714 --> 01:53:51,739
I'm not moving...
this is for Ajay.

860
01:53:53,351 --> 01:53:55,081
This could turn ugly, Aunty.

861
01:53:55,754 --> 01:53:56,550
Let it.

862
01:54:13,104 --> 01:54:21,068
UTv

863
01:54:21,179 --> 01:54:24,342
<i>Our blood is ranging.
It's flowing through the streets.</i>

864
01:54:24,616 --> 01:54:27,483
But it won't go in vain

865
01:54:29,087 --> 01:54:36,016
<i>Our eyes are blood shot for a purpose.
A cause we will attain.</i>

866
01:54:37,262 --> 01:54:44,031
<i>It fell from our bodies,
embraced the earth.</i>

867
01:54:44,869 --> 01:54:47,861
<i>Went winding through streets.
A river of courage</i>

868
01:54:48,139 --> 01:54:53,702
<i>...it surged and swept.</i>

869
01:54:54,613 --> 01:55:03,714
<i>It flowed to make a new
beginning</i>

870
01:55:16,768 --> 01:55:23,866
<i>From gaping wounds,
and gashes large,</i>

871
01:55:24,776 --> 01:55:31,772
<i>it oozed, slowly and steadily.</i>

872
01:55:32,250 --> 01:55:39,816
<i>While the pointing fingers,
got fists in reply,</i>

873
01:55:40,457 --> 01:55:44,019
<i>yet, our blood was raging.</i>

874
01:55:44,461 --> 01:55:49,421
<i>It flowed not in vain
but with a reason.</i>

875
01:55:50,067 --> 01:55:56,438
<i>A cause we will attain.</i>

876
01:55:57,775 --> 01:56:01,939
<i>Our eyes are blood shot
for a reason.</i>

877
01:56:02,146 --> 01:56:04,944
<i>A cause we will attain.</i>

878
01:56:05,916 --> 01:56:16,554
<i>Our blood is raging.
It's flowing through the streets.</i>

879
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:22,130
<i>...it surged and swept.</i>

880
01:56:23,334 --> 01:56:26,792
<i>It flowed to make a new
beginning</i>

881
01:56:27,004 --> 01:56:33,307
<i>Yet, our blood was raging.</i>

882
01:56:33,777 --> 01:56:41,115
<i>Yet, our blood was raging.</i>

883
01:56:41,685 --> 01:57:01,868
<i>Yet, our blood was raging.</i>

884
01:57:13,117 --> 01:57:16,143
Someone get a doctor! Quick!
We'll take it from here.

885
01:57:43,013 --> 01:57:45,641
They were beating up
innocent people...

886
01:57:47,417 --> 01:57:49,715
Why didn't you
stop them?

887
01:57:50,086 --> 01:57:52,213
You protested against
the government, our own party...

888
01:57:52,422 --> 01:57:53,252
That's unacceptable.

889
01:57:54,157 --> 01:57:56,250
The protest was not
against the government...

890
01:57:56,759 --> 01:57:58,454
...it was forthe truth.

891
01:58:00,430 --> 01:58:02,455
So many pilots have died...

892
01:58:02,665 --> 01:58:05,691
...young innocent boys who were fighting
for our country... killed...

893
01:58:05,935 --> 01:58:10,895
...so that someone in the
government could make money.

894
01:58:11,607 --> 01:58:13,905
And our party office doesn't
do a thing about it.

895
01:58:14,911 --> 01:58:15,639
Come... Sit down.

896
01:58:21,117 --> 01:58:21,879
Have some tea.

897
01:58:28,624 --> 01:58:35,086
Laxman, in politics there's
no place for emotions.

898
01:58:35,965 --> 01:58:38,126
We have big plans foryou.

899
01:58:39,268 --> 01:58:40,098
Big plans.

900
01:58:40,303 --> 01:58:45,673
Only dogs salivate when
you show them bone Mishraji.

901
01:59:17,672 --> 01:59:18,697
How's Aunty?

902
01:59:19,107 --> 01:59:20,234
They're doing an MRI.

903
01:59:39,694 --> 01:59:42,128
She's slipped into a coma.

904
01:59:42,531 --> 01:59:47,798
Severe skull damage,
coupled with the shock of her son's death.

905
01:59:48,703 --> 01:59:53,197
That's an ugly gash.
You need attention.

906
01:59:57,379 --> 01:59:59,574
Aslam... How's he?

907
02:00:04,219 --> 02:00:06,084
What have you come for?
Haven't you done enough damage?

908
02:00:10,725 --> 02:00:13,057
Uncle, it isn't
what you think.

909
02:00:13,528 --> 02:00:18,465
I'm not interested in what you think,
In what you want to do...

910
02:00:20,402 --> 02:00:22,199
I'm just going to say this once.

911
02:00:22,871 --> 02:00:25,203
Aslam doesn't
know what's good for him.

912
02:00:25,874 --> 02:00:28,274
He's an emotional boy, always has been.
He listens to his heart, not his head.

913
02:00:30,512 --> 02:00:32,946
These are bad times,
for people like us.

914
02:00:33,915 --> 02:00:37,715
Don't take him
down with you.

915
02:00:39,654 --> 02:00:40,382
He's inside.

916
02:00:40,589 --> 02:00:41,647
Go on...

917
02:01:01,775 --> 02:01:03,710
All parts working?

918
02:01:05,546 --> 02:01:08,515
Don't make me laugh, idiot.
It hurts

919
02:01:09,717 --> 02:01:10,776
How's Aunty?

920
02:01:12,053 --> 02:01:13,076
She's in a coma.

921
02:01:16,791 --> 02:01:18,519
How can this be
happening to us?

922
02:01:31,538 --> 02:01:32,699
Some dinner?

923
02:01:33,207 --> 02:01:35,402
No, don't worry Aunty.

924
02:01:36,377 --> 02:01:39,835
We just came to see Aslam.
We've got to get back to the hospital.

925
02:01:40,581 --> 02:01:41,548
Take care.

926
02:02:06,273 --> 02:02:07,706
Listen... I...

927
02:02:11,078 --> 02:02:15,981
...I'm sorry.

928
02:03:18,411 --> 02:03:19,469
Please eat.

929
02:03:42,735 --> 02:03:44,362
Everything's falling apart...

930
02:03:47,173 --> 02:03:49,038
...and all I can do is
stand and watch.

931
02:03:56,282 --> 02:03:58,409
People like us don't count
out here.

932
02:04:03,856 --> 02:04:12,321
This system is so messed up, a hundred more
Ajay's can die and nothing will change.

933
02:04:42,395 --> 02:04:45,887
Ajay did everything right,
all his life...

934
02:04:49,902 --> 02:04:56,966
...he was a good pilot,
a good friend, a good son...

935
02:04:57,810 --> 02:05:00,108
...he never harmed a soul.

936
02:05:01,681 --> 02:05:08,211
...he didn't deserve this...

937
02:05:10,021 --> 02:05:12,080
...Sonia didn't deserve this...

938
02:06:19,924 --> 02:06:23,383
Hey Karan... they've
spoilt your jacket.

939
02:06:24,561 --> 02:06:25,961
Long live India!

940
02:06:58,495 --> 02:07:00,828
The scoundrel got
away with it again.

941
02:07:01,533 --> 02:07:03,159
There's nothing can we do...

942
02:07:04,601 --> 02:07:06,433
...when the law of the land protects
people like the Defence Minister.

943
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:12,101
We have to take
drastic measures.

944
02:07:13,577 --> 02:07:14,737
What do you mean?

945
02:07:15,846 --> 02:07:17,245
Do what?

946
02:07:20,884 --> 02:07:22,044
Kill him.

947
02:07:24,488 --> 02:07:25,386
What?

948
02:07:26,323 --> 02:07:30,123
Kill the Defence Minister!
Are you crazy?

949
02:07:30,961 --> 02:07:32,428
We aren't killers Sonia.

950
02:07:32,629 --> 02:07:33,994
But they are.

951
02:07:34,298 --> 02:07:35,731
Have you lost it Karan!

952
02:07:35,933 --> 02:07:38,060
It's not a blood lust...

953
02:07:39,003 --> 02:07:40,231
...it's a matter of justice.

954
02:07:40,437 --> 02:07:41,904
I'll get the gun.

955
02:07:42,106 --> 02:07:46,975
Don't fuel things, Pandey. We can't
start killing people for any small reason.

956
02:07:47,778 --> 02:07:50,542
You think Ajay's death
is a small reason?

957
02:07:51,015 --> 02:07:52,676
Ajay's mother is
a small reason?

958
02:07:52,983 --> 02:07:55,884
You've got to understand Karan.

959
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:58,420
Lala Lajpat Rai's death
has to be avenged.

960
02:07:58,622 --> 02:08:00,089
Scott has to be killed.

961
02:08:00,290 --> 02:08:01,222
But...

962
02:08:10,768 --> 02:08:16,263
I always thought we didn't
believe in anything.

963
02:08:16,473 --> 02:08:20,569
So did I. Until now.

964
02:08:30,354 --> 02:08:31,821
Have we all gone crazy?

965
02:08:32,056 --> 02:08:36,755
He takes a morning walk at 8 a.m. Everyday,
We'll kill him then.

966
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:42,865
Who's we, huh?
Who's going to pull the trigger?

967
02:08:43,299 --> 02:08:44,197
I'll do it!

968
02:08:47,604 --> 02:08:51,869
Even though the morning security is relaxed
there is still a danger of getting caught.

969
02:08:52,141 --> 02:08:55,474
There is no looking back now!

970
02:09:39,555 --> 02:09:48,520
The Defence Minister was on his morning walk
when two unidentified gunmen opened fire.

971
02:09:48,798 --> 02:09:54,430
He was hit by three bullets in his chest, and was
declared dead as he reached the hospital.

972
02:09:54,637 --> 02:09:56,696
No group has yet claimed
responsibility forthis incident.

973
02:10:05,413 --> 02:10:10,374
Government spokespersons believe that this is
an attempt to destablise the government.

974
02:10:12,155 --> 02:10:17,524
The country has lost a great leader
because of the cowardly act of some terrorists.

975
02:10:18,094 --> 02:10:20,118
He was a true soldier, a true patriot.

976
02:10:20,329 --> 02:10:28,293
His contribution to the country
cannot be described in words.

977
02:10:29,605 --> 02:10:30,629
Sukhi!

978
02:10:32,675 --> 02:10:34,973
Meanwhile our sources have
discovered a telephonic conversation...

979
02:10:35,178 --> 02:10:38,807
...involving middle man Rajnath Singhania
in an arms deal.

980
02:10:39,114 --> 02:10:43,745
This conversation took place just a few days
before the Defence Minister's assassination.

981
02:10:43,952 --> 02:10:47,649
The Russians want us
to reduce our commission.

982
02:10:47,956 --> 02:10:52,087
Didn't you tell them,
its not a defence deal, but our deal.

983
02:10:52,694 --> 02:10:55,822
That's why I told them. - "Take it or leave it"

984
02:10:56,031 --> 02:10:59,559
Let's go.

985
02:11:16,451 --> 02:11:17,679
Paaji, where's DJ?

986
02:11:17,886 --> 02:11:19,820
They were just here.

987
02:11:25,126 --> 02:11:27,060
He hasn't come home all night.

988
02:11:30,632 --> 02:11:32,156
Is everything alright?

989
02:11:33,235 --> 02:11:34,133
Yes, ask him to call me.

990
02:11:34,336 --> 02:11:37,931
He said he'd be
spending the night at DJ's.

991
02:11:51,453 --> 02:11:52,886
Have you seen DJ?

992
02:11:56,258 --> 02:11:58,556
Is everything alright?

993
02:12:03,064 --> 02:12:06,625
Come with me...

994
02:12:12,339 --> 02:12:15,638
Don't worry... nothing
will happen to those boys...

995
02:12:16,944 --> 02:12:19,413
Daljeet has always
been a brat...

996
02:12:19,614 --> 02:12:24,812
...he used to disappear
on his bike for days...

997
02:12:31,293 --> 02:12:32,760
I'm scared...

998
02:12:33,328 --> 02:12:35,922
Don't be afraid...

999
02:12:36,298 --> 02:12:38,492
God will take care of everything...

1000
02:12:40,135 --> 02:12:45,936
God watches over
the people we love.

1001
02:12:56,984 --> 02:12:58,611
Defence Minister...
the martyr...

1002
02:13:02,489 --> 02:13:07,426
...one of India's favourite sons...
Scoundrel!

1003
02:13:08,829 --> 02:13:11,798
They're honouring him
with the National Medal of Honour.

1004
02:13:12,333 --> 02:13:16,360
All our efforts, wasted.

1005
02:13:17,171 --> 02:13:19,002
People need to
know the truth.

1006
02:13:19,206 --> 02:13:21,470
...and who's going to tell them the truth?

1007
02:13:21,675 --> 02:13:24,405
We have to
surrender ourselves.

1008
02:13:24,678 --> 02:13:25,406
What?

1009
02:13:26,580 --> 02:13:35,682
Terriffic! You want us to walk right
in and give ourselves up!

1010
02:13:35,889 --> 02:13:37,083
And who should
we surrenderto?

1011
02:13:37,291 --> 02:13:39,816
The police are
mere puppets.

1012
02:13:40,027 --> 02:13:43,087
Should we just
sit back?

1013
02:13:43,297 --> 02:13:46,926
No! Let's kill
them all!

1014
02:13:47,134 --> 02:13:48,465
Right Pandey?

1015
02:13:48,669 --> 02:13:50,330
Someone make
him shut up!

1016
02:13:59,246 --> 02:14:01,339
You always knew that
yourfather was in it.

1017
02:14:03,050 --> 02:14:04,347
You knew everything.

1018
02:14:07,554 --> 02:14:08,350
No Sukhi...

1019
02:14:08,554 --> 02:14:11,922
You're lying!

1020
02:14:12,625 --> 02:14:14,616
You always wanted to take
revenge on yourfather.

1021
02:14:14,827 --> 02:14:15,725
Sukhi, shut up!

1022
02:14:15,928 --> 02:14:20,491
Who am I to say anything?

1023
02:14:21,234 --> 02:14:25,194
DJ he's used you...

1024
02:14:25,905 --> 02:14:30,968
...he's used all of us...

1025
02:14:31,478 --> 02:14:35,880
Mark my words,
his father will bail him out.

1026
02:14:36,083 --> 02:14:38,607
But we'll get caught.
And I don't want to die DJ...

1027
02:14:38,818 --> 02:14:41,253
I don't want to die.

1028
02:14:48,261 --> 02:14:50,252
We did all this for Ajay.

1029
02:14:54,634 --> 02:14:55,999
What will happen now DJ?

1030
02:15:04,644 --> 02:15:06,043
You've decided?

1031
02:15:06,746 --> 02:15:12,844
I need to know the truth...
don't worry.

1032
02:15:13,953 --> 02:15:17,389
I'm not worried.
Just don't be late.

1033
02:15:33,039 --> 02:15:34,472
Nothing will happen
to you Karan.

1034
02:15:36,209 --> 02:15:37,107
That's a promise.

1035
02:15:37,743 --> 02:15:40,268
Just give me the
names of the others.

1036
02:15:41,481 --> 02:15:47,386
I'll get you the best lawyers,
pull all the strings possible.

1037
02:15:48,221 --> 02:15:53,557
You were forced into it, do you
understand? You were forced.

1038
02:15:58,063 --> 02:16:00,760
Do you get me?

1039
02:16:03,301 --> 02:16:06,600
Yourfather's reputation,
his life's work is at stake.

1040
02:16:07,038 --> 02:16:09,097
Why did you do it?

1041
02:16:12,611 --> 02:16:13,600
Why did you do it, Dad?

1042
02:16:13,813 --> 02:16:16,577
What did I do?

1043
02:16:17,415 --> 02:16:21,978
Ajay always said,
"I'll give my life forthis country."

1044
02:16:22,954 --> 02:16:27,483
"...I'm not afraid of death."

1045
02:16:30,996 --> 02:16:44,467
Ajay was burnt alive... and all you can
think of is sending me out of the country...

1046
02:16:45,410 --> 02:16:47,105
You killed him!

1047
02:16:48,046 --> 02:16:50,412
You made a joke of his death...

1048
02:16:50,649 --> 02:16:53,243
I know you're very disturbed...

1049
02:16:53,718 --> 02:16:59,122
Relax! Let me
handle things.

1050
02:17:00,058 --> 02:17:02,754
I'll find a way out.

1051
02:17:03,662 --> 02:17:04,924
Really Dad?
Is there a way out?

1052
02:17:05,163 --> 02:17:07,495
Of course.

1053
02:18:16,300 --> 02:18:19,828
You don't have
to do this...

1054
02:18:24,174 --> 02:18:27,109
Sukhi, this might
end badly.

1055
02:18:29,546 --> 02:18:34,643
Without you guys it will
end for me anyway...

1056
02:18:35,819 --> 02:18:36,912
Idiot.

1057
02:18:48,265 --> 02:18:55,137
Ajay's death, won't go in vain,
Ma. I promise you.

1058
02:19:31,241 --> 02:19:40,741
This is Rahul, and you've tuned
in to yourfavourite radio show...

1059
02:20:59,529 --> 02:21:02,987
Hey Karan!
What're you doing here?

1060
02:21:03,299 --> 02:21:04,425
We need a favour.

1061
02:21:04,634 --> 02:21:05,658
Sure!

1062
02:21:06,002 --> 02:21:07,264
I need you to
put us on air.

1063
02:21:08,471 --> 02:21:12,271
Put you on air?

1064
02:21:12,475 --> 02:21:14,272
Yeah, now!

1065
02:21:14,710 --> 02:21:18,271
That's impossible man...
I'll lose my job.

1066
02:21:18,481 --> 02:21:20,108
...as it is, they
don't pay me.

1067
02:21:21,484 --> 02:21:23,782
It's payback time.

1068
02:21:23,986 --> 02:21:28,116
Hey! Whateveryou say DJ!
It's your station.

1069
02:21:29,991 --> 02:21:31,687
Gun... He's got a gun!

1070
02:21:31,894 --> 02:21:34,124
Karan you go in.
I'll handle it.

1071
02:21:35,498 --> 02:21:40,902
Keep the show on.
Don't mess with us.

1072
02:21:44,507 --> 02:21:46,974
Come on... leave.

1073
02:21:50,046 --> 02:21:51,479
Paaji is anyone inside?

1074
02:21:53,849 --> 02:21:57,148
Uncleji run. Don't stop.

1075
02:21:58,854 --> 02:22:02,655
Gun... Security he's got a gun!

1076
02:22:04,427 --> 02:22:06,326
Don't be a wise guy.

1077
02:22:06,529 --> 02:22:12,934
Everybody leave!
Out! Move!

1078
02:22:13,135 --> 02:22:15,831
Don't panic we won't
harm anyone.

1079
02:22:16,038 --> 02:22:23,944
Move! Move! Move!

1080
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:31,185
Hurry up, quick!

1081
02:22:47,402 --> 02:22:53,932
The time is 6:05 a.m. And you're listening
to "The night is still young".

1082
02:22:54,142 --> 02:22:57,043
Today I've got a
surprise guest foryou.

1083
02:22:57,412 --> 02:23:01,872
An old friend of mine Karan Singhania, who just
dropped in to say something to all of you...

1084
02:23:09,624 --> 02:23:15,790
My name is Karan Singhania... My friends
and I... we killed the Defence Minister...

1085
02:23:17,499 --> 02:23:21,765
I repeat we killed
the Defence Minister...

1086
02:23:21,969 --> 02:23:25,303
Ravi take me to the radio
station quickly. Hurry up!

1087
02:23:25,706 --> 02:23:30,769
We are not terrorists. We aren't
backed by any foreign organisation.

1088
02:23:31,780 --> 02:23:33,680
We don't even belong to
any political group...

1089
02:23:35,382 --> 02:23:37,407
We're just five students
from Delhi University.

1090
02:23:38,452 --> 02:23:40,751
We killed the
Defense Minister because...

1091
02:23:42,022 --> 02:23:50,123
...he murdered ourfriend Flight Lieutenant Ajay
Rathod and many other Air Force pilots...

1092
02:23:50,464 --> 02:23:55,095
We killed him because after he
murdered Ajay, he murdered his name...

1093
02:23:56,604 --> 02:24:07,446
Ajay's mother, right now,
is fighting for her life...

1094
02:24:10,385 --> 02:24:14,787
A Defence Minister is supposed to
safegaurd a nation. Not sell it.

1095
02:24:16,157 --> 02:24:22,652
Men like the Defence Minister
aren't just above the law... they control it.

1096
02:24:23,665 --> 02:24:32,038
We killed him because someone
had to say, "Enough!".

1097
02:24:32,639 --> 02:24:34,129
We might be wrong...

1098
02:24:35,175 --> 02:24:37,200
...because its a sin to
kill someone.

1099
02:24:38,312 --> 02:24:40,177
But we couldn't tolerate it anymore.

1100
02:24:41,081 --> 02:24:43,311
Today we are here to confess to our sin.

1101
02:24:44,651 --> 02:24:48,143
Today we are here to tell everybody
that something has to be done

1102
02:24:50,124 --> 02:24:51,853
It's got to be done.

1103
02:24:55,129 --> 02:24:59,327
We've just received news that Defence Minister's
assassins are hiding in All India Radio building.

1104
02:24:59,767 --> 02:25:09,199
Karan Singhania and his friends are still
with us. Listeners can call in on 3291777.

1105
02:25:09,910 --> 02:25:15,644
Until then, here is
"Roobaroo"

1106
02:25:20,487 --> 02:25:21,419
It's done.

1107
02:25:31,632 --> 02:25:33,259
<i>Hey, dude!</i>

1108
02:25:35,469 --> 02:25:41,669
<i>I just realized.</i>

1109
02:25:43,644 --> 02:25:49,707
<i>There's a fire
burning within me.</i>

1110
02:25:51,552 --> 02:25:53,075
<i>It's a new dawn,</i>

1111
02:25:55,321 --> 02:25:57,881
<i>I can feel its light</i>

1112
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:05,465
<i>Burn so bright, I could,
scorch the sun</i>

1113
02:26:06,066 --> 02:26:21,641
<i>'Cause I'm face to face
with the light</i>

1114
02:26:22,748 --> 02:26:34,558
<i>The dream I once lost,
I've found.</i>

1115
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:36,921
<i>It's blooming,</i>

1116
02:26:38,664 --> 02:26:44,728
<i>it's melting,</i>

1117
02:26:46,606 --> 02:26:54,342
<i>notes re-arranging,</i>

1118
02:26:54,547 --> 02:27:02,010
<i>into a whole new melody.</i>

1119
02:27:03,956 --> 02:27:05,651
Will they give us
good food in jail?

1120
02:27:08,060 --> 02:27:12,519
Food?
Next he'll want beer.

1121
02:27:17,470 --> 02:27:23,238
You guys have become famous. Calls are
pouring in from all overthe country.

1122
02:27:23,442 --> 02:27:25,137
Come on!
They want to talk to you...

1123
02:27:31,751 --> 02:27:32,375
Police!

1124
02:27:33,586 --> 02:27:36,214
This is unreal man. Where
did they come from?

1125
02:27:36,422 --> 02:27:38,117
This will ruin my career...

1126
02:27:38,324 --> 02:27:40,120
Shut up!

1127
02:27:41,460 --> 02:27:46,762
Karan you get on air...
We don't have much time...

1128
02:27:46,965 --> 02:27:47,693
Take care.

1129
02:27:53,206 --> 02:27:57,642
The Delhi police have reached the spot and are
rescuing civilians trapped in the building.

1130
02:28:04,583 --> 02:28:06,574
...reporting from
Mumbai's Churchgate area...

1131
02:28:06,785 --> 02:28:08,616
...reporting from
Cotton College, Guwahati.

1132
02:28:08,820 --> 02:28:10,685
...reporting from
S. P. College, Srinagar...

1133
02:28:10,890 --> 02:28:14,689
...reporting from
Lucknow University...

1134
02:28:15,393 --> 02:28:18,362
Hi, my name is Prakash.
And I want to congratulate you.

1135
02:28:18,563 --> 02:28:23,591
You did the right thing by killing him.
All our ministers should be lined up and shot.

1136
02:28:24,236 --> 02:28:27,672
Prakash, who all
will you shoot?

1137
02:28:28,073 --> 02:28:32,942
These corrupt ministers are a reflection
of our society. We've chosen them.

1138
02:28:36,381 --> 02:28:38,246
We need to change ourselves
to bring about a change.

1139
02:28:39,217 --> 02:28:43,677
Hello! This is
Principal Sharma from Indore...

1140
02:28:44,022 --> 02:28:47,924
You have set a terrible example by
taking the law into your own hands.

1141
02:28:49,394 --> 02:28:52,886
You're right sir.
We're sorry.

1142
02:28:53,765 --> 02:28:59,362
But give me the name of one
politician who has gone to jail for his crimes.

1143
02:29:00,538 --> 02:29:02,165
Who else is on
your hit-list? I

1144
02:29:02,907 --> 02:29:04,340
We have no hit-list.

1145
02:29:05,710 --> 02:29:07,905
How do you feel after
killing the Defence Minister?

1146
02:29:08,113 --> 02:29:13,141
We did not kill him out
of any blood lust...

1147
02:29:31,970 --> 02:29:35,428
If you get caught you'll be hanged.
Aren't you afraid?

1148
02:29:36,408 --> 02:29:37,306
No.

1149
02:29:45,150 --> 02:29:48,846
The college students who
have claimed responsibility...

1150
02:29:49,053 --> 02:29:50,384
...are still inside.

1151
02:29:51,189 --> 02:29:58,458
Karan, while we applaud your courage,
do you think you'll escape?

1152
02:29:58,962 --> 02:30:00,453
If we wanted to escape, we wouldn't
have been here in the first place.

1153
02:30:42,539 --> 02:30:45,906
Shit! They're shooting at us DJ!
They're shooting at us!

1154
02:30:46,110 --> 02:30:50,376
Shut up for a second!

1155
02:30:52,282 --> 02:30:55,410
They're mistaking us forterrorists.
They think we're armed.

1156
02:30:57,621 --> 02:31:02,456
Wait a minute!
I'll try to handle it.

1157
02:31:22,678 --> 02:31:29,175
No Sukhi!
What did you do!

1158
02:31:31,888 --> 02:31:36,053
Shit DJ! Just when I was getting
good with the girls...

1159
02:31:59,315 --> 02:32:02,842
My name is Indra. What's the difference
between you and a terrorist?

1160
02:32:03,052 --> 02:32:09,184
There's a big difference.
Terrorists kill innocent people. We didn't...

1161
02:32:16,666 --> 02:32:23,572
Aslam, close
the door. Quick!

1162
02:32:25,875 --> 02:32:27,775
We are not terrorists.
Why don't they...

1163
02:33:19,595 --> 02:33:22,654
It's not a lust for blood...
it's a matter of justice!

1164
02:33:23,165 --> 02:33:28,660
Why are bullets being used when its
clearthat these are college students?

1165
02:35:13,507 --> 02:35:22,438
No matter what you do, this country
will never change. It has no future.

1166
02:35:25,819 --> 02:35:31,314
No country is perfect.
You've got to make it perfect.

1167
02:35:34,995 --> 02:35:41,059
Join the police,
military, IAS...

1168
02:35:42,469 --> 02:35:45,233
Become a part of
the political system...

1169
02:35:47,841 --> 02:35:53,006
This country will change...
We will change it!

1170
02:35:54,915 --> 02:35:58,351
If you believed the Defence Minister
deserved to be punished then...

1171
02:35:59,053 --> 02:36:03,080
...what about the allegations against
yourfather? Why such double standards?

1172
02:36:05,926 --> 02:36:07,257
We'll find a way
to fix this.

1173
02:36:08,929 --> 02:36:10,260
There's just one way
to fix this Dad.

1174
02:36:30,084 --> 02:36:31,051
I'm sorry Dad...

1175
02:37:01,013 --> 02:37:02,481
My name is Daljeet Singh.

1176
02:37:04,418 --> 02:37:06,476
There are only two
ways to live your life.

1177
02:37:07,687 --> 02:37:13,592
Tolerate things the
way they are...

1178
02:37:15,195 --> 02:37:19,153
...Ortake responsibility
to change them.

1179
02:37:22,201 --> 02:37:27,833
Karan Singhania killed his
father before coming here.

1180
02:37:34,781 --> 02:37:41,119
Shit DJ!
You're bleeding badly!

1181
02:37:42,288 --> 02:37:48,488
Relax! It got tired of flowing in my veins.
It just wanted to be free.

1182
02:37:50,496 --> 02:37:52,965
Aslam... Laxman... Sukhi?

1183
02:37:54,233 --> 02:37:55,131
All gone.

1184
02:38:07,914 --> 02:38:12,214
...Karan, I think I'm in love...

1185
02:38:15,021 --> 02:38:16,579
...I nevertold you dude...

1186
02:38:18,491 --> 02:38:21,756
...I can't stop thinking
about her...

1187
02:38:25,631 --> 02:38:27,189
I know... she's something else.

1188
02:38:30,369 --> 02:38:32,929
You two'll make
a great couple.

1189
02:38:38,344 --> 02:38:44,544
There's just one problem though. I don't know
Whetherthe kids will be black or white.

1190
02:39:09,307 --> 02:39:12,277
Let me go!
They're just boys, damn it!

1191
02:40:32,123 --> 02:40:34,683
We'll turn this spark into a raging fire.

1192
02:40:34,893 --> 02:40:38,294
This will swell like a wave and
will bring an end to corruption.

1193
02:40:42,233 --> 02:40:46,896
If we want to shake the entire population out of
their slumberthen we need an explosion like this.

1194
02:40:53,711 --> 02:40:58,274
When we grow out of this, well be a nation
which is beautiful and free of corruption.

1195
02:41:05,090 --> 02:41:09,048
Lord, accept the sacrifices of these children.

1196
02:41:36,053 --> 02:41:46,019
UTv

1197
02:41:58,042 --> 02:41:59,509
Come Bhagat...

1198
02:42:02,346 --> 02:42:04,337
Dad, what are you doing?

1199
02:42:04,715 --> 02:42:08,674
I'm sowing mango seeds.
If I plant one, a thousand will grow.
