26
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,110
Give me the case.

27
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,711
What are you fucking at, man?

28
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:37,766
For fuck's sake.

00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,616

30
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:40,985

00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:49,128
- Oh, fuck.

34
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:51,164
I'm just dying

35
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,929
Look, there's 20 cent.
Look it.

36
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:57,404
Look, don't fucking rob me.

37
00:02:57,504 --> 00:02:59,840
I'm down there trying to fucking
make a living like anyone else.

38
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,344

the same team, man.

00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:03,711
I'm sorry, right,
I'm sorry, man.

40
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:05,781
But you're right.
You're rapid, you are.

41
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,549
You want money, just fucking,
just ask me for it.

42
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:09,986
Don't have me chase you all
the way up the street for it.

43
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:14,408
Want to give us that
fiver then, do ya?

44
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:18,678
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Here.

45
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:20,231
How's your ma?

46
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,317
She's dead, man.

47
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:23,567
Well, how's your old fella?

48
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:26,183
Fair play to ya, right?

49
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:28,374
I'll see you later,

50
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,176
Look, there's two euros, look.

51
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,577
Fair play to ya, right?

52
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:33,683
See you, good luck, man.

53
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:02,471
# Scratching
at the surface now #

54
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:09,285
# And I'm trying hard
to work it out #

55
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:16,523
# And so much has gone
misunderstood #

56
00:04:18,965 --> 00:04:23,567
# And this mystery
only leads to doubt #

57
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:29,843
# And I didn't understand #

58
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:36,814
# When you reached out
to take my hand #

59
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:43,794
# And if you have
something to say#

60
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:50,119
# You'd better say it now #

61
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:54,074
# 'Cause this is
what you've waited for#

62
00:04:56,842 --> 00:05:00,647
# Your chance to even up
the score #

63
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,100
# And as these shadows fall #

64
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,912
# On me now I'll win somehow #

65
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,415
# Yeah #

66
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:22,488
# 'Cause I'm picking up
a message, Lord #

67
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:29,062
# That I'm closer
than I've ever been before #

68
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:33,301
# So if you have something
to say #

69
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:36,118
# Say it to me now#

70
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:43,695
# Just say it to me now, now #

71
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:51,023
# Oh, oh #

72
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:54,122
# 0h #

73
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:56,211
# 0h. #

74
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:12,564
Thanks.

75
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,382
Ten cents
brilliant. Thanks.

76
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:17,202
Excuse me?

77
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:19,398
Sorry.

78
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:22,375
<i>Big Issue?</i>

79
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:24,794
Can't afford it.

80
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:28,361
This song you just play,
you write it?

81
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:30,017
Working on it.

82
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:31,919
It's not an established song?

83
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,289
No, it's not an
established song.

84
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:35,624
How come you don't play it

85
00:06:35,724 --> 00:06:36,758
during daytime?

86
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:38,260
I see you every day.

87
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,263
You know, during the day, people
want to hear songs they know,

88
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:42,798
just songs that they recognize.

89
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:44,401
I mean, otherwise,
I wouldn't make any money.

90
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:46,236
I play these songs at night.
They wouldn't listen.

91
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,288
I listen.

92
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:51,091
Yeah, but you gave me ten cents.

93
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:53,358
You do it
for money then?

94
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,745
Why don't you
get a job

95
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:55,980
in a shop?

96
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,097
I have a job in a shop.

97
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:01,286
Listen, I'm going to get
back to this, yeah?

98
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,489
Nice to meet you.

99
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,823
Who'd you write that song
for, please?

100
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,360
No one.

101
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,748
Bullshit.

102
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:15,270
Where is she?

103
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,758
She's gone.

104
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:20,676
She's dead?

105
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:24,130
No, she's not dead, she's gone.

106
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,915
You love her still?

107
00:07:26,015 --> 00:07:28,144
Jesus, man.

108
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:34,474
You're over her.

109
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:35,693
Rubbish.

110
00:07:35,793 --> 00:07:37,829
No one who would write
this song is over her.

111
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:39,531
I'm telling you.

112
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:42,434
You play this marvelous song
to her, you get her back.

113
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:44,503
I don't want her back.

114
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:47,391
I see.

115
00:07:47,491 --> 00:07:50,361
What shop you work in?

116
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:52,279
I work in a Hoover repair shop.

117
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,614
A Hoover?

118
00:07:53,714 --> 00:07:56,284
You know, like a vacuum cleaner.
Whhzzz.

119
00:07:56,384 --> 00:07:58,534
You fix vacuum cleaners?

120
00:07:58,634 --> 00:07:59,655
I do.

121
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:02,676
I have a broken vacuum cleaner.

122
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:04,460
- You fix it for me?
- Yeah.

123
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,229
I bring it tomorrow then?

124
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:07,163
Okay.

125
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:08,197
This is great.

126
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:09,198
Tomorrow?

127
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:10,233
Right.

128
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,168
- Okay, bye.
- Good luck.

129
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:22,964
# You have broken me
all the way down #

130
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:27,456
# Down upon my knees #

131
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:37,248
# And you have broken me
all the way now #

132
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:46,390
Hi. This is Catherine.

133
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,879
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

134
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:12,491
# I'll be far to sea #

135
00:09:19,546 --> 00:09:21,015
That job's ready
for collection now, Dad.

136
00:09:21,115 --> 00:09:22,751
Okay, son.

137
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:25,234
I'm going to head into town.

138
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:30,231
Should I turn this
around for you?

139
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,663
What'll I get for dinner?

140
00:09:32,763 --> 00:09:34,765
The fish, maybe.

141
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:01,362
Hello.

142
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:03,497
How are you? How's it going?

143
00:10:03,597 --> 00:10:04,999
I bring you my Hoover.

144
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:11,306
All right.

145
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:13,326
What's wrong with it?

146
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:15,361
It is fucked.

147
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,213
It doesn't suck up
the dirt.

148
00:10:17,313 --> 00:10:18,782
Well, listen, there's
nothing I can do,

149
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:20,684
I don't have any of my
tools or nothing with me.

150
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:22,219
I'm going on me break now.

151
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:23,954
Can you bring it in
tomorrow or something?

152
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:26,056
Well, no, I bring it today.

153
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:28,310
- You, you...
- Yeah, but there's nothing

154
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,628
I can do with it, love,

155
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:30,830
I don't have
me tools, or...

156
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,665
It's like I have
to bring it home.

157
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:37,020
If I come on break, you have
a look at it at least?

158
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:38,971
Yeah, but you
don't understand.

159
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,574
I come with you, then?

160
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,128
For lunch?

161
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:44,177
Yeah, all right.

162
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:45,646
- Yes, we go together?
- Yeah.

163
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,415
Okay.

164
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:49,531
Thank you.

165
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:52,426
- You hungry?
- I'm always hungry.

166
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:05,031
So you know a bit
about music then?

167
00:11:07,304 --> 00:11:10,141
My father used to play in
the orchestra back at home.

168
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:12,839
He played violin.

169
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:17,617
But he got arthritis then,
and he killed himself.

170
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:19,051
Really?

171
00:11:19,151 --> 00:11:22,856
But before he go, he teach me
how to play piano.

172
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:25,259
"It's not so hard
on the fingers" he said.

173
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:28,410
Do you get to play much?

174
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,599
Hmm. No, I don't, I don't
have a piano at home.

175
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:33,702
I can't get one in Ireland;
it's so much money.

176
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:35,804
I can't afford it.

177
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,593
Yeah, it's expensive
all right.

178
00:11:47,918 --> 00:11:49,487
I play in a
piano shop.

179
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:50,956
This man lets me play-

180
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:53,307
one hour per day
at lunch.

181
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:55,976
Somewhere around here?

182
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:57,329
You want to
hear me play?

183
00:11:57,429 --> 00:11:59,381
- Yeah.
- Now?

184
00:11:59,482 --> 00:12:00,366
Yeah.

185
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,698
Okay.

186
00:12:05,873 --> 00:12:07,875
Can we come in?

187
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:18,588
This is the man
I was telling you about.

188
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:19,789
He's a real gentleman.

189
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:20,790
Hi.

190
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,058
Okay for me
to play today?

191
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,259
Yeah, that's fine.

192
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,461
Thanks.

193
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:26,930
Not the baby Yamaha
though. She's sold.

194
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,033
- Okie-dokie.
- Mm-hmm.

195
00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:36,709
Now, which one today?

196
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:20,660
# #

197
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:52,964
That kind of thing.

198
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:57,650
It's amazing.

199
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:58,704
Did you write that?

200
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,657
No, no, Mendelssohn did.

201
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,774
It's good.

202
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:04,936
It's good, yes.

203
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,113
Play me another
of your songs.

204
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,115
No.

205
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,116
Please.

206
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,150
Not here.

207
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,919
Why? Here, Billy
doesn't mind.

208
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:15,423
- You think it would be all right?
- Yes.

209
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:17,992
Okay.

210
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:19,594
Let's put that there, yeah?

211
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:21,696
Mm-hmm.

212
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:24,834
This is in C, yeah?

213
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:26,936
Yeah, okay,
I can see that.

214
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:28,989
Okay.

215
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:31,289
So, it goes, um...

216
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:35,628
Da... It goes,
# Da-da-da-da #

217
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:43,074
# Da-da-da-da,
da-da-da-da-da #

218
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,823
Yeah? And then there's
a bit in there-

219
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:46,925
Can you do that?

220
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:54,651
# Da-da-da-da-da... #

221
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:55,836
Brilliant.

222
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,638
And then there's another
part that goes, uh...

223
00:14:57,738 --> 00:15:01,188
# Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa #

224
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:05,261
# Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa #

225
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:09,135
# Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa #

226
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:11,320
Yeah? And then the
chorus, let's see.

227
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,588
- You have those two bits?
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:13,791
And the chorus goes...

229
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:18,010
# Da-da-da-da-da

230
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:24,990
# Pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa #

231
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:31,897
# Ba-ba... da-da. #

232
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,412
That's it. Perfect. Brilliant.

233
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:35,281
So, do you want
to give it a spin?

234
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:38,832
- Yes, try it.
- Okay.

235
00:15:38,932 --> 00:15:40,688
Two, three,

236
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:42,790
four.

237
00:15:56,406 --> 00:16:03,599
# I don't know you,
but I want you #

238
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:11,138
# All the more for that #

239
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:18,585
# And words fall through me
and always fool me #

240
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:24,119
# And I can't react #

241
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:26,287
We change here.

242
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:34,636
# And games that never amount
to more than they're meant #

243
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:39,839
# Will play themselves out #

244
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:41,159
Hold it.

245
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:43,261
And the chorus.

246
00:16:44,729 --> 00:16:52,856
# Take this sinking boat
and point it home #

247
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:58,994
# We've still got time #

248
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:03,801
# Raise your hopeful voice #

249
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:07,070
# You had the choice #

250
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:14,626
# You've made it now #

251
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:25,124
# Falling slowly,
eyes that know me #

252
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:29,378
# And I can't go back #

253
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:40,176
# Moods that take me
and erase me #

254
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:47,520
# And I'm painted black#

255
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:56,196
# Well, you have suffered enough
and warred with yourself #

256
00:17:56,296 --> 00:18:00,744
# It's time that you won #

257
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:05,022
Again.

258
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:14,452
# Take this sinking boat
and point it home #

259
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:20,825
# We've still got time #

260
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:25,595
# Raise your hopeful voice #

261
00:18:25,695 --> 00:18:28,830
# You had the choice #

262
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:36,228
# You've made it now #

263
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:47,273
# Uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh-huh... #

264
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:52,643
# Yeah #

265
00:18:52,743 --> 00:19:00,870
# Take this sinking boat
and point it home #

266
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:07,279
# We've still got time #

267
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:11,813
# Raise your hopeful voice #

268
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:21,629
# You had the choice,
you've made it now #

269
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:29,634
# Falling slowly,
sing your melody #

270
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:36,633
# I'll sing along... #

271
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,231
# Ah, ah... #

272
00:19:55,331 --> 00:19:59,537
# #

273
00:19:59,637 --> 00:20:02,089
# Call and I'll sing along. #

274
00:20:32,993 --> 00:20:34,562
I moved back in
about a year ago,

275
00:20:34,662 --> 00:20:39,002
after me ma died, just to
help me dad out, you know.

276
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:42,404
So tell me about her.

277
00:20:42,504 --> 00:20:44,373
Who, me ma?

278
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:49,398
No, the girl, the special girl
you write these songs for.

279
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,713
No.

280
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:53,064
Come on.

281
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:55,152
What did she do to you?

282
00:20:58,155 --> 00:21:01,740
Well.

283
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:10,020
# Ten years ago, I fell in
love with an Irish girl #

284
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,023
# She took my heart #

285
00:21:13,124 --> 00:21:18,694
# But she went and screwed
some guy that she knew #

286
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:23,704
# And now I'm in Dublin
with a broken heart #

287
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:29,041
# Oh, broken-hearted
Hoover-fixer sucker guy#

288
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:33,379
# Oh, broken-hearted
Hoover-fixer sucker... #

289
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:37,048
# Sucker guy #

290
00:21:37,148 --> 00:21:41,321
# One day, I'll go there
and win her once again #

291
00:21:41,421 --> 00:21:47,827
# But until then, I'm just
a sucker of a guy. #

292
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:57,675
So she's with him now?

293
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:58,725
- No.
- Don't know.

294
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:00,828
Where is she?

295
00:22:01,463 --> 00:22:05,768
# She's in old London town #

296
00:22:08,638 --> 00:22:12,739
# Living somewhere
around Chiswick. #

297
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:19,618
I miss her.
It's just sort of... you know.

298
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:24,005
You're not going
to go get her?

299
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,857
No?

300
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:29,192
No. Fuck her.

301
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:31,130
# Fuck her,
fuck her. #

302
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,632
# Fuck her, she's gone #

303
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:35,653
# Fuck her, she's gone forever#

304
00:22:35,753 --> 00:22:37,370
# She fucking fucked it up!... #

305
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,972
Sorry.

306
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:40,073
Sorry.

307
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:43,258
# Fucking fucked it up #

308
00:22:43,358 --> 00:22:46,327
# She fucking fucked it up! #

309
00:22:46,428 --> 00:22:48,550
# And now she's gonna die. #

310
00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:01,722
Give us the sharp eight
there, son.

311
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:08,887
And the Phillips.

312
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,975
Come on.

313
00:23:13,111 --> 00:23:15,614
Your son
is a very talented man, sir.

314
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:18,418
Well, he should be.
I trained him meself.

315
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:20,220
Oh, no. I meant the songs.

316
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,369
Oh, right. Is he?

317
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:24,191
- Very.
- Okay, that's done.

318
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,194
You can take it back
with you.

319
00:23:26,294 --> 00:23:28,396
It was just the belt,
so it should be all right now.

320
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:30,365
Thank you.
How much do I owe you?

321
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:31,899
Oh, you're fine there;
it's free.

322
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:34,382
Nothing's for free.
How much?

323
00:23:36,205 --> 00:23:38,208
Say four euro, love.

324
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,514
Okay. We're going
to head upstairs, Dad.

325
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:45,750
Is there anything
else you need?

326
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,118
No, I'm grand.

327
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:48,486
Okay.

328
00:23:48,587 --> 00:23:50,455
A pleasure to meet you, sir.

329
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,190
And you.

330
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,458
Take care.

331
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:55,561
Good.

332
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,772
Come on in.

333
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,082
There you are.

334
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:34,807
Wow.

335
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:38,410
Can you transfer this stuff on to
disc for me so I can listen?

336
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,497
Yeah.

337
00:24:40,597 --> 00:24:41,815
I have to go now.

338
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:44,999
Do you want to stay?

339
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:47,166
What do you mean?

340
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,404
Stay the night?

341
00:24:49,504 --> 00:24:51,791
What?

342
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,799
Fuck this.

343
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:58,534
Thanks for the Hoover, yeah?

344
00:24:58,634 --> 00:25:00,931
- See you.
- See you around.

345
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,443
Fuck.

346
00:25:09,346 --> 00:25:12,147
Flowers? Flowers?

347
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:20,091
- Hey.
- Hey.

348
00:25:20,192 --> 00:25:22,207
How's it going?

349
00:25:22,307 --> 00:25:23,963
Hey, where you going?

350
00:25:24,063 --> 00:25:28,148
I wanted to give you the CDs
that I made for you.

351
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:30,671
I'm really...
I'm just really lonely,

352
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:32,373
and you're gorgeous,
and I just...

353
00:25:32,473 --> 00:25:34,409
I'm sorry. I fucked up.
I'm sorry. I...

354
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:37,193
I don't know what to say.

355
00:25:37,293 --> 00:25:39,281
It won't happen again.

356
00:25:45,288 --> 00:25:47,223
Do you have a CD player?

357
00:25:47,323 --> 00:25:48,926
Yeah.

358
00:25:49,026 --> 00:25:51,576
Here you go.

359
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:54,733
Batteries are pretty low,
but it should work.

360
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,802
I give it back.

361
00:25:56,902 --> 00:25:58,437
No problem. Keep it.

362
00:25:58,537 --> 00:26:01,086
I have to go now.

363
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:02,775
I'll talk
to you later.

364
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:05,077
You don't want to get a cup of
tea or something? I'd love to...

365
00:26:05,177 --> 00:26:06,780
just talk to you
a bit more.

366
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,282
I have responsibilities.
I have to go home.

367
00:26:09,383 --> 00:26:11,818
Is it okay to walk along
with you then?

368
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:13,253
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

369
00:26:13,353 --> 00:26:15,757
Cool. Cool.
So how was it today?

370
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:17,939
Selling good.

371
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,795
And today is a really good day
for me

372
00:26:19,895 --> 00:26:23,683
because I got a job
in a big house, cleaning.

373
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:27,336
This lady is going to pay me
some money, so I'm very happy.

374
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:30,074
That's brilliant.
I'm delighted.

375
00:26:39,217 --> 00:26:41,186
This is where I live.

376
00:26:41,286 --> 00:26:44,539
Oh, yeah? Cool.

377
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:46,458
All right, then.

378
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,160
Do you want to come in?

379
00:26:48,261 --> 00:26:52,448
Can I? Yeah. Cool.

380
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:54,067
Hi, guys.

381
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:55,202
Hello.

382
00:26:55,302 --> 00:26:56,203
How are you today?

383
00:26:56,303 --> 00:26:57,371
Not bad, not bad.

384
00:26:57,471 --> 00:26:58,740
How is work?

385
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,375
It's great.

386
00:27:00,475 --> 00:27:02,570
See you later.

387
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:42,824
Ah, hi.

388
00:27:45,174 --> 00:27:47,030
This is my friend.
This is my mother.

389
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,211
How are you?

390
00:27:49,311 --> 00:27:51,266
Nice to meet you.
How's it going?

391
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:58,759
This is my
daughter Ivonka.

392
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:01,527
Come on.

393
00:28:01,627 --> 00:28:03,845
Hello, Ivonka. Hello.

394
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:18,116
Sorry?

395
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:20,668
That's dinner. Do you
want to stay for dinner?

396
00:28:20,768 --> 00:28:22,770
Yeah. Thank you.

397
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:35,985
Want to sit down?

398
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:37,253
Yeah.

399
00:28:37,353 --> 00:28:39,355
MOTHER:

400
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:03,617
Well, what did she say?

401
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:05,285
She says you're handsome.

402
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:06,621
She what?

403
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:08,289
Says you're handsome.

404
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:09,791
How do I say thanks?

405
00:29:14,663 --> 00:29:16,032
Says, "You're welcome."

406
00:29:16,132 --> 00:29:17,801
Cool. Thanks.

407
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:19,169
Ty to speak a little English, Mama.

408
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:21,272
No, thank you.

409
00:29:22,739 --> 00:29:24,274
Careful.

410
00:29:24,374 --> 00:29:25,743
Careful, Ivonka.
Don't do that.

411
00:29:25,843 --> 00:29:27,885
She's grand.
She's grand.

412
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:31,249
Where's her dad?

413
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:33,831
He doesn't live here.

414
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:36,516
Why not?

415
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,294
He's at home.

416
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:49,121
Hello. Hi.

417
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,572
These are
from next door.

418
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:52,939
They come in
to watch telly.

419
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,776
- Yeah.
- Hi, guys.

420
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,344
There's only one
telly in the building.

421
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:58,047
<i>We watch Fair City together.</i>

422
00:29:58,147 --> 00:29:59,749
<i>Fair City, we love.<i/></i>

423
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:02,602
<i>We learn English
from Fair City.</i>

424
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:04,421
Are you not pregnant?

425
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:08,610
How are you, man?

426
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:10,720
What is the hurry?

427
00:30:22,742 --> 00:30:24,444
Just put her in there.

428
00:30:24,544 --> 00:30:26,546
Okay.

429
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:29,617
There you go, dearie.

430
00:30:33,155 --> 00:30:34,388
Okay.

431
00:30:34,488 --> 00:30:36,491
She likes you.

432
00:31:09,796 --> 00:31:12,847
You have no lyrics
for this one?

433
00:31:12,947 --> 00:31:15,337
It's really good.
I like it.

434
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:20,488
I've got a few,
but they're not right.

435
00:31:21,277 --> 00:31:23,279
Huh?

436
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,902
I've got a few,
but they're not right.

437
00:31:28,002 --> 00:31:30,466
What? Do you like it?

438
00:31:30,566 --> 00:31:31,789
It's great.

439
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:35,726
Would you be into trying...
trying to write lyrics for it?

440
00:31:35,826 --> 00:31:37,495
Really? I could?

441
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:38,964
Yeah. It's just
like that idea?

442
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,799
- Yeah.
- Cool. Cool.

443
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,001
That would be good.

444
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:43,770
I can keep machine
and write it?

445
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,105
Yeah. Do. I was having
a bit of trouble with it.

446
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:48,175
It's too romantic for me.

447
00:31:48,275 --> 00:31:49,810
It is romantic.

448
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,712
You have a
romantic streak.

449
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:54,862
I used to have
a romantic streak.

450
00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:56,951
When?

451
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,737
When I was your age,
I suppose.

452
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:02,725
I see. You're
an old man now.

453
00:32:02,825 --> 00:32:04,827
Yeah. Dying.

454
00:32:06,562 --> 00:32:08,564
Cynical.

455
00:32:12,403 --> 00:32:14,372
You have to go now.

456
00:32:14,472 --> 00:32:17,075
Thanks for the Hoover
and food and songs.

457
00:32:17,175 --> 00:32:19,178
No problem.

458
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:25,152
Thanks for the company.

459
00:32:25,252 --> 00:32:26,785
I needed it.

460
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:28,888
Me, too.

461
00:32:30,424 --> 00:32:32,826
You don't want
to go for late coffee

462
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:34,494
or a walk or something? No?

463
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:36,263
I can't. See you.

464
00:32:36,364 --> 00:32:37,865
Bye.

465
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:39,968
See you.

466
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:18,012
Fuck you, batteries.

467
00:33:34,764 --> 00:33:36,894
Jesus.

468
00:33:44,242 --> 00:33:47,112
I'll pay you back.

469
00:33:49,714 --> 00:33:51,717
Come on.

470
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:07,117
# Are you really here #

471
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:11,125
# Or am I dreaming? #

472
00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:16,728
# I can't tell dream
from truth #

473
00:34:16,828 --> 00:34:19,829
# For it's been so long #

474
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:23,671
# Since I have seen you #

475
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:29,648
# I can hardly remember
your face anymore #

476
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:36,352
# When I get pretty lonely #

477
00:34:36,453 --> 00:34:42,194
# And the distance
causes only silence #

478
00:34:42,294 --> 00:34:48,799
# I think of you smiling #

479
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:52,502
# With pride in your eyes #

480
00:34:52,602 --> 00:34:56,038
# Lover that sighs #

481
00:34:56,138 --> 00:35:01,917
# If you want me #

482
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:08,393
# Satisfy me #

483
00:35:08,493 --> 00:35:14,664
# If you want me #

484
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:21,216
# Satisfy me #

485
00:35:23,057 --> 00:35:30,452
# Are you really sure
that you believe me #

486
00:35:30,552 --> 00:35:36,121
# When others say I lie? #

487
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:43,100
# I wonder if you could
ever despise me #

488
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,836
# When you know I really tried #

489
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:52,274
# To be a better one #

490
00:35:52,374 --> 00:35:55,779
# To satisfy you #

491
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,585
# For you're everything to me #

492
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:08,360
# And I'll do what you ask me #

493
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:15,337
# If you let me be free #

494
00:36:15,437 --> 00:36:21,344
# If you want me #

495
00:36:21,444 --> 00:36:27,817
# Satisfy me #

496
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:34,190
# If you want me #

497
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:41,015
# Satisfy me #

498
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:59,586
# If you want me #

499
00:36:59,686 --> 00:37:05,825
# Satisfy me #

500
00:37:05,926 --> 00:37:12,302
# If you want me #

501
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:18,488
# Satisfy me #

502
00:38:00,272 --> 00:38:04,595
# Escalated #

503
00:38:04,695 --> 00:38:11,147
# Little cracks they escalated #

504
00:38:12,252 --> 00:38:18,708
# From back inside comes #

505
00:38:18,808 --> 00:38:22,947
# Lies, lies #

506
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:27,219
# Breaking... #

507
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:29,419
# When will... #

508
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,641
When will you learn?

509
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,743
When will you learn?

510
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:43,675
# I think it's time
we give it up #

511
00:38:43,775 --> 00:38:50,278
# And figure out
what's stopping us #

512
00:38:50,379 --> 00:38:57,088
# From breathing easy #

513
00:38:57,188 --> 00:39:04,398
# And talking straight #

514
00:39:04,498 --> 00:39:11,105
# The way is clear
if you're ready now #

515
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:18,847
# The volunteer
is slowing down #

516
00:39:18,948 --> 00:39:23,720
# And taking time #

517
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:32,701
# To save himself #

518
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:39,905
# The little cracks,
they escalated #

519
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:46,077
# Before we knew
it was too late #

520
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:53,523
# For making circles #

521
00:39:53,623 --> 00:39:59,880
# And telling lies #

522
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:12,444
# And I, I can't
keep up with you #

523
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:19,284
# Maybe if you
slowed down for me #

524
00:40:19,385 --> 00:40:24,590
# I could see
you're only telling #

525
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:30,497
# Lies, lies, lies #

526
00:40:30,598 --> 00:40:36,269
# Breaking us down with your #

527
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:41,976
# Lies, lies, lies #

528
00:40:42,076 --> 00:40:47,835
# When will you learn? #

529
00:41:12,328 --> 00:41:18,221
# The little cracks,
they escalated #

530
00:41:18,321 --> 00:41:24,661
# Before we knew
it was too late #

531
00:41:24,761 --> 00:41:31,665
# For making circles #

532
00:41:31,765 --> 00:41:39,325
# And telling lies #

533
00:41:44,265 --> 00:41:49,921
# And I, I can't keep up with you #

534
00:41:50,022 --> 00:41:56,095
# Maybe if you'd
slow down for me #

535
00:41:56,195 --> 00:42:01,835
# I could see
you're only telling #

536
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:07,107
# Lies, lies, lies #

537
00:42:07,207 --> 00:42:12,915
# Breaking us down with your #

538
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:19,054
# Lies, lies, lies #

539
00:42:19,154 --> 00:42:25,711
# When will you learn? #

540
00:42:28,216 --> 00:42:31,347
# So plant the thought #

541
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:42,498
Would you like to buy a flower?

542
00:42:42,598 --> 00:42:44,167
- Hi. How are you?
- How's it going?

543
00:42:44,267 --> 00:42:45,469
Pretty good.

544
00:42:45,569 --> 00:42:47,404
- Pretty good.
- Good to see you.

545
00:42:47,504 --> 00:42:49,874
I'm going to go to
London, I've decided.

546
00:42:49,974 --> 00:42:50,976
- Good.
- Yeah.

547
00:42:51,076 --> 00:42:52,010
That's great.

548
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,545
Yeah, it's good,
it makes sense.

549
00:42:53,645 --> 00:42:55,347
Well done.

550
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,016
When are you going?

551
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,199
I'm going
to go Monday.

552
00:42:59,299 --> 00:43:01,536
Wow, that's, that's soon.

553
00:43:01,636 --> 00:43:04,124
You'll get
your girlfriend back,

554
00:43:04,224 --> 00:43:06,160
and you'll get
your record deal, and...

555
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,214
- become famous.
- Yeah, right.

556
00:43:09,314 --> 00:43:10,531
- Good.
- But listen,

557
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:12,200
I was thinking, I was
thinking before I go,

558
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,235
I want to make a recording
of a few songs.

559
00:43:14,335 --> 00:43:15,804
A couple of the songs
I was playing you,

560
00:43:15,904 --> 00:43:18,307
and I really liked the way
you played and your singing.

561
00:43:18,407 --> 00:43:20,910
So, if you feel like, would
you be into playing along?

562
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,277
Like what we
were playing on?

563
00:43:22,377 --> 00:43:24,214
- I would sing and play?
- Yeah.

564
00:43:24,314 --> 00:43:25,682
I'd love that.

565
00:43:25,782 --> 00:43:27,084
Really? Cool.

566
00:43:27,184 --> 00:43:29,520
- So you'd be in my band for a few days.
- Yeah.

567
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,740
Well, that's the first thing
I've got sorted out.

568
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,494
Now I just need to sort
everything else out.

569
00:43:35,594 --> 00:43:38,430
All right, guys, welcome.

570
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:42,267
Now, so let me
give you the tour.

571
00:43:42,368 --> 00:43:44,804
That is your
live rooms in there.

572
00:43:44,905 --> 00:43:46,439
This is a new desk.

573
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:49,476
You got your hard drive and
you got your outboard gear.

574
00:43:49,576 --> 00:43:51,012
Now all in all
we're talking about

575
00:43:51,112 --> 00:43:52,113
three grand
for a weekend of...

576
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,214
- Three?
- Yeah.

577
00:43:53,314 --> 00:43:54,749
Three grand, that's pretty good.

578
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,152
You must be crazy.

579
00:43:56,252 --> 00:43:57,352
$3,000

580
00:43:57,452 --> 00:43:59,738
Well, have a look around.

581
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:02,405
You've everything
you need.

582
00:44:02,505 --> 00:44:05,394
- What do you think, is it good?
- It's pretty good.

583
00:44:05,494 --> 00:44:07,915
We'll give you one.

584
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:10,667
I'm sorry.

585
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:12,070
Have you heard
this guy's songs?

586
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:13,471
I haven't yet, no.

587
00:44:13,571 --> 00:44:14,539
He's great.

588
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:15,606
Okay, but, uh,

589
00:44:15,706 --> 00:44:19,110
listen, I can fill
this place in an hour.

590
00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:24,210
One and a half then,
that's my limit.

591
00:44:25,985 --> 00:44:27,787
We can talk about two.

592
00:44:27,887 --> 00:44:29,422
We don't talk.

593
00:44:29,522 --> 00:44:30,758
We shake.

594
00:44:30,858 --> 00:44:31,992
We shake on two, yeah?

595
00:44:32,092 --> 00:44:33,894
Shake now?

596
00:44:33,994 --> 00:44:35,097
All right.

597
00:44:35,197 --> 00:44:36,098
Two thousand.

598
00:44:36,198 --> 00:44:37,265
She drives a hard bargain.

599
00:44:37,365 --> 00:44:39,368
She's a tough cookie.

600
00:44:43,339 --> 00:44:45,922
So you like this shop?

601
00:44:46,022 --> 00:44:48,260
I buy all my clothes here.

602
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,247
It's good for me, you know?

603
00:44:50,347 --> 00:44:51,915
Cheap.

604
00:44:52,015 --> 00:44:54,043
Nice fashions.

605
00:44:55,186 --> 00:44:56,120
Okay, you ready?

606
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,315
Yeah, I'm ready.

607
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:05,097
That's good. That will do.

608
00:45:05,197 --> 00:45:07,033
<i>Do you like it?</i>

609
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:08,235
You're gorgeous.

610
00:45:08,335 --> 00:45:10,337
All right, can we go?

611
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:22,234
# #

612
00:45:27,207 --> 00:45:29,192
# #

613
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,601
The quality is poor,

614
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:40,739
but if we can get
a professional tape,

615
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:45,434
I'm, I'm satisfied that he
can secure a lucrative deal.

616
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:49,215
You take it home, you,
you listen to it.

617
00:45:49,316 --> 00:45:50,549
You play it to your boss.

618
00:45:50,649 --> 00:45:53,628
I'm sure you can
get him to approve.

619
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:55,856
Can I show you something?

620
00:45:55,956 --> 00:45:59,907
# I want to be free #

621
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,496
# I want to be me #

622
00:46:01,596 --> 00:46:04,951
# I want you to bayou #

623
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:34,447
Nice one, lads.

624
00:46:34,547 --> 00:46:35,501
How's it going?

625
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:36,603
How's it going?
All right.

626
00:46:36,703 --> 00:46:37,671
Good, how is it today?

627
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:38,672
Is it slow?

628
00:46:38,772 --> 00:46:40,342
Have a look
there yourself.

629
00:46:40,442 --> 00:46:42,444
Is that it? Is that it?

630
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:44,980
That's how it's
going at the moment.

631
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,214
Listen, I wanted
to ask you,

632
00:46:46,315 --> 00:46:47,849
as myself and herself
are making a tape...

633
00:46:47,949 --> 00:46:49,151
How's it going?
All right?

634
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:51,554
of a few songs down
at Samson's Studios

635
00:46:51,654 --> 00:46:53,889
and I was just wondering, if
you were around next weekend,

636
00:46:53,989 --> 00:46:56,326
for, to, if you'd be
interested in doing it.

637
00:46:56,426 --> 00:46:57,327
A bit of recording?

638
00:46:57,427 --> 00:46:58,328
Bit of recording, yeah?

639
00:46:58,429 --> 00:46:59,830
Yeah, doing Lizzy
stuff. or...?

640
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:01,565
No, it's not Lizzy,
it's me own songs.

641
00:47:01,665 --> 00:47:02,767
We only do Lizzy.

642
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:05,788
Really. It's one
of our things.

643
00:47:05,888 --> 00:47:09,708
That sort of stuff. Is it, sort
of rocky Lizzy stuff or...?

644
00:47:09,808 --> 00:47:12,194
- No. No, it's not.
- Yeah,

645
00:47:12,295 --> 00:47:13,380
Singer-songwriter stuff?

646
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,713
It's kind of singer-songwriter, yeah.

647
00:47:14,814 --> 00:47:16,182
- Kinda...
- Is it any good?

648
00:47:16,282 --> 00:47:17,183
- Uh...
- It's great.

649
00:47:17,283 --> 00:47:18,685
Is it?

650
00:47:18,785 --> 00:47:19,686
Well, look, like I said,

651
00:47:19,786 --> 00:47:21,055
I don't really know
much about them,

652
00:47:21,155 --> 00:47:22,223
but they seem
like nice people.

653
00:47:22,323 --> 00:47:23,791
Yeah. I just have to
call my mother first.

654
00:47:23,891 --> 00:47:24,859
- Then we go.
- Cool.

655
00:47:24,959 --> 00:47:25,893
Great, great.

656
00:47:47,986 --> 00:47:49,220
Okay, come on,
we can go.

657
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,323
Cool.

658
00:48:07,942 --> 00:48:11,771
Food's ready! Everybody
get your plates ready!

659
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,105
- Hello?
- Hi, how are you?

660
00:48:21,205 --> 00:48:23,659
Come on in, kids!
Take a seat!

661
00:48:38,444 --> 00:48:39,612
Everything all right
here, folks?

662
00:48:39,712 --> 00:48:41,080
Yeah, brilliant.

663
00:48:41,181 --> 00:48:42,216
Enjoying the party?

664
00:48:42,316 --> 00:48:43,217
Yeah.

665
00:48:43,317 --> 00:48:44,251
Great to see you here.

666
00:48:44,351 --> 00:48:45,753
Can you sing?

667
00:48:45,853 --> 00:48:47,187
If you can't sing,
you're out.

668
00:48:47,288 --> 00:48:52,111
# There's one request
I'll ask of you #

669
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:57,450
# When your liberty you gave #

670
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:02,256
# Remember Mitchell far away #

671
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:07,196
# A convict bound in chains. #

672
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:18,738
#... mine that once held
this heart of mine. #

673
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:25,415
# #

674
00:49:25,515 --> 00:49:30,890
# And I love her so #

675
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:36,210
# I wouldn't trade her
for gold #

676
00:49:38,214 --> 00:49:43,437
# I'm walking on moonbeams #

677
00:49:43,537 --> 00:49:49,089
# I was born
with a silver spoon #

678
00:49:50,994 --> 00:49:55,446
# Hell, I'm gonna be me #

679
00:49:55,547 --> 00:50:00,499
# I'm gonna be free #

680
00:50:02,676 --> 00:50:06,728
# I'm walking on moonbeams #

681
00:50:06,828 --> 00:50:12,884
# Staring out to sea #

682
00:50:14,855 --> 00:50:20,281
# And if a door be closed #

683
00:50:20,381 --> 00:50:25,601
# Then a row of homes
start building #

684
00:50:27,705 --> 00:50:33,496
# And tear your curtains down #

685
00:50:33,596 --> 00:50:40,719
# For sunlight is like gold #

686
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,256
# Hell, you better be you #

687
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,166
Hey.

688
00:50:53,266 --> 00:50:55,316
What are you doing here?

689
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:57,839
I just came out.
You want to go for a spin?

690
00:50:57,939 --> 00:50:59,073
That's your bike?

691
00:50:59,173 --> 00:51:00,241
It's me dad's.

692
00:51:00,342 --> 00:51:01,943
He absolutely loves it,
but I've robbed it

693
00:51:02,044 --> 00:51:03,045
off him for the day.

694
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:04,346
If he knew,
he'd kill me.

695
00:51:04,446 --> 00:51:06,928
Would he?

696
00:51:07,028 --> 00:51:09,314
So do you fancy a spin, no?

697
00:51:10,353 --> 00:51:12,456
I'd love to,
but I have to go to work.

698
00:51:12,556 --> 00:51:14,525
That's cool.

699
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:16,594
Another time, yeah?

700
00:51:18,095 --> 00:51:20,989
and see if you were
into going now.

701
00:51:22,668 --> 00:51:24,236
Could you have me back by lunch?

702
00:51:24,336 --> 00:51:26,419
Yeah, totally.

703
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:28,174
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

704
00:51:28,274 --> 00:51:29,175
Fancy it?

705
00:51:29,275 --> 00:51:31,277
Great.

706
00:52:07,953 --> 00:52:10,807
You're what?

707
00:52:10,907 --> 00:52:11,991
You're married.

708
00:52:12,091 --> 00:52:14,093
Does it surprise you?

709
00:52:15,028 --> 00:52:17,030
Fuck's sake.

710
00:52:18,232 --> 00:52:20,816
Yeah.

711
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:22,269
When?

712
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:25,607
Two years ago, when I find out
I'm pregnant with Ivonka.

713
00:52:28,526 --> 00:52:31,494
So where is he?

714
00:52:31,594 --> 00:52:32,982
He's back in
Czech Republic.

715
00:52:33,082 --> 00:52:37,337
It's over now and, you know,
I come here on my own.

716
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,258
Man.

717
00:52:43,728 --> 00:52:45,731
You all right?

718
00:52:57,077 --> 00:52:59,661
What's the Czech
for "ocean"?

719
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:00,648
Ott-san.

720
00:53:00,748 --> 00:53:01,649
Ott-san.

721
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:03,184
Pretty much the same.

722
00:53:03,284 --> 00:53:05,286
Otsan.

723
00:53:07,356 --> 00:53:09,398
So what are
you gonna do?

724
00:53:11,561 --> 00:53:13,563
I don't know.

725
00:53:15,698 --> 00:53:19,283
There's such distance
between me and him.

726
00:53:19,384 --> 00:53:22,273
He's so much different
to me and so much older.

727
00:53:22,373 --> 00:53:26,628
It doesn't really work.

728
00:53:26,728 --> 00:53:28,614
I'm fine on my own, you know?

729
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:33,650
It's just, I don't want Ivonka
to grow up without a father.

730
00:53:38,392 --> 00:53:41,923
What's the Czech for...
"Do you love him?"

731
00:53:43,063 --> 00:53:44,331
Noor-esh-ho?

732
00:53:44,432 --> 00:53:46,301
Noor-esh-ho?

733
00:53:46,401 --> 00:53:47,969
So...

734
00:53:48,069 --> 00:53:50,071
Noor-esh-ho?

735
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:53,609
Noor-ho-tebbe.

736
00:53:55,477 --> 00:53:56,345
What?

737
00:53:56,445 --> 00:53:57,980
Come on, let's go.

738
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,149
What'd you say?

739
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:01,985
- Tell me.
- You've got to teach me how to ride

740
00:54:02,085 --> 00:54:04,472
- the bike now, eh?
- No way.

741
00:54:04,572 --> 00:54:05,556
- Yeah.
- No.

742
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:07,425
So come on, can I have a go?

743
00:54:07,525 --> 00:54:08,426
No.

744
00:54:08,526 --> 00:54:09,728
Please.

745
00:54:09,828 --> 00:54:12,811
No, leave it alone, will you?

746
00:54:12,912 --> 00:54:16,083
But teach me how to
drive it, will you?

747
00:54:16,183 --> 00:54:17,036
Come on, just once.

748
00:54:17,136 --> 00:54:18,036
No, it's not mine.

749
00:54:18,137 --> 00:54:19,105
Me dad would go
fucking crazy.

750
00:54:19,205 --> 00:54:20,139
But he's not here now.

751
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:21,141
Be careful, will you!

752
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:22,610
Be careful,
for fuck's sake.

753
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:23,944
Look, he's not
here now.

754
00:54:24,044 --> 00:54:26,013
- Just teach me.
- Look, my dad. Look. No, no, no.

755
00:54:26,113 --> 00:54:27,014
- No?
- No.

756
00:54:27,114 --> 00:54:30,035
- Please?
- No.

757
00:54:30,135 --> 00:54:31,553
Me dad will go
bleedin' mental.

758
00:54:31,653 --> 00:54:33,121
He totally loves this thing.

759
00:54:33,221 --> 00:54:34,957
Yeah, but you drive it.

760
00:54:35,057 --> 00:54:36,526
Yeah, he doesn't
know I have it.

761
00:54:36,626 --> 00:54:37,527
He doesn't?

762
00:54:37,627 --> 00:54:38,628
No.

763
00:54:38,728 --> 00:54:41,565
Well, then he won't
know I had it, too.

764
00:54:41,665 --> 00:54:44,986
No.
You can't have a go on it.

765
00:54:45,086 --> 00:54:45,970
Just once.

766
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:46,971
No.

767
00:54:47,071 --> 00:54:50,324
- Turn it on for me.
- No.

768
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:51,309
No.

769
00:54:51,409 --> 00:54:52,577
Come on, give
us the keys.

770
00:54:52,678 --> 00:54:53,846
I'll do it myself.

771
00:54:53,946 --> 00:54:55,948
The key's in it.

772
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:06,661
Thank you for the ride.

773
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,728
I'll see you
tomorrow, yeah?

774
00:55:07,828 --> 00:55:09,263
- For rehearsals.
- Okay, yeah.

775
00:55:09,363 --> 00:55:10,264
Okay.

776
00:55:10,364 --> 00:55:12,406
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

777
00:55:24,848 --> 00:55:29,517
# Tying to pull myself away #

778
00:55:33,725 --> 00:55:38,896
# I'm caught in a pattern
and I can't escape #

779
00:55:42,602 --> 00:55:48,411
# I'm trying
to pull myselfaway... #

780
00:55:54,415 --> 00:55:59,503
# Lately, when I get back,
there's this thing I know... #

781
00:55:59,603 --> 00:56:04,276
# Everything comes
to you, way to go #

782
00:56:04,377 --> 00:56:09,483
# Even a heart has
something to learn... #

783
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,569
Thanks, Dad.

784
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,973
All right, guys,
this is Eamon.

785
00:56:15,073 --> 00:56:16,541
He's going to
take care of you

786
00:56:16,641 --> 00:56:17,676
for the weekend.

787
00:56:17,776 --> 00:56:19,177
Eamon, this is everyone.

788
00:56:19,277 --> 00:56:20,312
Kit's set up.

789
00:56:20,412 --> 00:56:23,148
Piano is waiting for you
in the live room.

790
00:56:23,248 --> 00:56:25,919
Tea and coffee in the kitchen
as you came in. Help yourselves.

791
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:27,487
You'll need plenty.

792
00:56:27,587 --> 00:56:29,090
And there is a nice
little burrito place

793
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,958
around the corner if you
want a snack, all right?

794
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:31,960
Great.

795
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,294
Okay, Eamon,
leave it to you.

796
00:56:33,394 --> 00:56:34,528
Good luck, everyone.

797
00:56:34,629 --> 00:56:37,199
Enjoy. And I might pop in
later, all right?

798
00:56:37,299 --> 00:56:38,968
- Cheers, man.
- Cheers, thanks.

799
00:56:39,068 --> 00:56:41,103
Okay, guys,
good to meet you.

800
00:56:41,203 --> 00:56:42,505
We've a few little
bits and pieces

801
00:56:42,605 --> 00:56:43,539
to set up.

802
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:45,075
I want to check
the drums inside.

803
00:56:45,175 --> 00:56:47,594
We've already set up the kit.

804
00:56:47,694 --> 00:56:50,948
Yeah, I just want to, you know,
check them for sound.

805
00:56:51,048 --> 00:56:53,050
I checked them already; it's fine.

806
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:56,954
Okay, we need to set up mics
on them for recording, yeah?

807
00:56:57,055 --> 00:56:58,757
Oh.

808
00:56:58,857 --> 00:57:00,191
Have you done much recording?

809
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,547
- No.
- No.

810
00:57:01,647 --> 00:57:01,961
No.

811
00:57:02,061 --> 00:57:05,040
- Right. Let's get cracking.
- Yeah.

812
00:57:32,496 --> 00:57:34,198
Yeah, no, I can't
do it now, love.

813
00:57:34,298 --> 00:57:35,532
I'm stuck here in the studio

814
00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:37,234
with this bunch
of fucking oddballs.

815
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:40,338
Can you hang on a second?
Just one second.

816
00:57:42,141 --> 00:57:43,475
Okay, are you ready to rock?

817
00:57:43,575 --> 00:57:44,442
Are we ready?

818
00:57:44,543 --> 00:57:46,545
Yep. We're in tune.

819
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:50,216
So Al and Timmy,
on the second verse, just...

820
00:57:50,316 --> 00:57:52,352
this is pretty much
simple enough thing.

821
00:57:52,452 --> 00:57:53,954
It's in five-four,
and the second verse,

822
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:55,957
I'll give you a nod
to come in there, yeah?

823
00:57:56,057 --> 00:57:58,025
Is that all right? And you're in
from the top with me, yeah?

824
00:57:58,125 --> 00:58:00,763
And you know what you're doing.

825
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:05,317
All right, then, so, uh...

826
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:07,782
whenever you're ready, yeah.

827
00:58:14,144 --> 00:58:16,260
All right, later.

828
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,982
Okay, we're ready. Fire one.

829
00:58:18,082 --> 00:58:19,783
You sure you're ready?

830
00:58:19,883 --> 00:58:23,254
Okay, listen now for
the click track, everybody.

831
00:58:23,354 --> 00:58:24,756
And away we go.

832
00:58:24,856 --> 00:58:29,680
This is track one,
take one, yeah.

833
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:33,591
All right, lads, here we go,
this is it, yeah.

834
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:53,874
# So #

835
00:58:53,974 --> 00:58:58,510
# If you want something #

836
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:02,350
# And you call, call #

837
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:06,383
# Then I'll come running #

838
00:59:06,483 --> 00:59:09,190
# To fight #

839
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:12,976
# And I'll be at your door #

840
00:59:14,147 --> 00:59:22,043
# When there's nothing
worth running for #

841
00:59:22,144 --> 00:59:26,141
# When your mind's made up #

842
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:30,246
# When your mind's
made up #

843
00:59:30,346 --> 00:59:34,052
# There's no point
trying to change it #

844
00:59:34,152 --> 00:59:38,324
# When your mind's made up #

845
00:59:38,424 --> 00:59:41,892
# When your mind's
made up #

846
00:59:41,993 --> 00:59:46,302
# There's no point
trying to stop it #

847
00:59:46,402 --> 00:59:48,804
# You see #

848
00:59:48,905 --> 00:59:53,609
# You're just like everyone #

849
00:59:53,709 --> 00:59:57,480
# When the shit falls #

850
00:59:57,581 --> 01:00:03,099
# All you want to do
is run away #

851
01:00:05,373 --> 01:00:08,924
# And hide all by yourself #

852
01:00:09,024 --> 01:00:12,663
# When you're far from me #

853
01:00:12,763 --> 01:00:17,768
# There's nothing else #

854
01:00:17,868 --> 01:00:21,641
# When your mind's made up #

855
01:00:21,742 --> 01:00:25,411
# When your mind's
made up #

856
01:00:25,511 --> 01:00:29,351
# There's no point trying
to change it #

857
01:00:29,451 --> 01:00:33,385
# When your mind's made up #

858
01:00:33,485 --> 01:00:37,491
# When your mind's
made up #

859
01:00:37,591 --> 01:00:41,263
# There's no point
even talking #

860
01:00:41,363 --> 01:00:45,271
# When your mind's made up #

861
01:00:45,371 --> 01:00:49,303
# When your mind's
made up #

862
01:00:49,404 --> 01:00:53,145
# There's no point
trying to fight it #

863
01:00:53,245 --> 01:00:57,483
# When your mind's #

864
01:00:57,583 --> 01:01:05,591
# Your mind's #

865
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:09,627
# Made #

866
01:01:09,727 --> 01:01:11,775
# Up... #

867
01:01:20,494 --> 01:01:24,816
# Ah #

868
01:01:24,916 --> 01:01:28,517
# There's no point trying
to change it #

869
01:01:28,617 --> 01:01:36,594
# When your #

870
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:44,993
# 0h #

871
01:01:52,498 --> 01:02:01,473
# Ooh, ooh #

872
01:02:04,711 --> 01:02:10,383
# So... if you ever
want something #

873
01:02:12,219 --> 01:02:16,474
# And you call, call #

874
01:02:16,574 --> 01:02:20,795
# Then I'll come running. #

875
01:02:28,071 --> 01:02:29,840
Okay.

876
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,675
Wow.

877
01:02:31,775 --> 01:02:33,777
That was nice.

878
01:02:34,678 --> 01:02:36,314
Did you write that?

879
01:02:36,414 --> 01:02:38,417
Yeah.

880
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:49,212
# You must have
fallen from the sky #

881
01:02:49,312 --> 01:02:52,200
# You must have shattered
in the runway #

882
01:03:20,566 --> 01:03:24,888
# You need somewhere
to fall apart #

883
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:32,559
# Someone to fall upon #

884
01:03:39,254 --> 01:03:41,707
# That fools the bulls #

885
01:03:41,807 --> 01:03:43,758
# The powdered hag #

886
01:04:23,388 --> 01:04:26,355
Okay, what do you think?

887
01:04:26,455 --> 01:04:28,692
I think it's fucking weird.

888
01:04:28,793 --> 01:04:32,316
There's a couple of little tech bits,
we can probably fix them,

889
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:35,752
but uh, you know, it's 4:00 in the morning,
so it's up to you guys.

890
01:04:35,852 --> 01:04:39,224
Do you want to push through
or go for another one?

891
01:04:39,324 --> 01:04:41,893
I'd love to keep going
if everybody is into it.

892
01:04:41,993 --> 01:04:44,095
Can I have a cup of tea
or something first?

893
01:04:44,195 --> 01:04:45,864
Want a cup of tea?

894
01:04:45,964 --> 01:04:48,668
- You want to take ten or 15, yeah?
- Sure.

895
01:04:48,768 --> 01:04:50,169
I'll tweak what I can.

896
01:04:50,269 --> 01:04:51,671
You guys take ten.

897
01:04:51,771 --> 01:04:56,392
Guys, why do you think there
are no blonde priests?

898
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:59,030
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

899
01:05:20,437 --> 01:05:22,440
This is great.

900
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:49,070
How's it going?

901
01:05:51,139 --> 01:05:52,808
Good.

902
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:55,077
I don't think we're supposed
to be here, though.

903
01:05:55,178 --> 01:05:57,659
Ah, it's all right.

904
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,182
This is beautiful, isn't it?

905
01:05:59,282 --> 01:06:01,619
Yeah, it's a beautiful piano,
like a Baldwin.

906
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:02,786
It's a perfect piano.

907
01:06:02,886 --> 01:06:04,188
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

908
01:06:04,288 --> 01:06:08,375
Play us one of your songs.

909
01:06:08,475 --> 01:06:12,164
Hmm... They're
all half-written and more ideas.

910
01:06:12,264 --> 01:06:14,647
Go on, I'd love to hear one.

911
01:06:16,335 --> 01:06:18,171
Okay, I have one,

912
01:06:18,271 --> 01:06:21,822
but... it's not finished and I...

913
01:06:21,923 --> 01:06:23,110
I don't really...

914
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:24,278
Just play it, I know.

915
01:06:24,378 --> 01:06:26,046
Okay, but the lyrics
are very rough, okay?

916
01:06:26,146 --> 01:06:28,811
- It'll be great.
- Okay.

917
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:49,125
# Walking up the hill
tonight #

918
01:06:49,225 --> 01:06:54,583
# When you have closed
your eyes #

919
01:06:58,016 --> 01:07:02,840
# I wish I didn't have
to make #

920
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:08,390
# All those mistakes
and be wise #

921
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:17,225
# But please try
to be patient #

922
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:23,309
# And know
that I'm still learning #

923
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:32,510
# I'm sorry
that you have to see #

924
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:37,499
# The strength inside me
burning #

925
01:07:40,667 --> 01:07:46,824
# And where are you,
my angel, now? #

926
01:07:46,924 --> 01:07:53,684
# Don't you see me crying? #

927
01:07:55,082 --> 01:08:00,305
# I know that you can't
do it all #

928
01:08:00,406 --> 01:08:06,961
# But you can't say
I'm not trying #

929
01:08:08,999 --> 01:08:14,487
# And I'm letting myself down #

930
01:08:14,587 --> 01:08:21,350
# By satisfying you #

931
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:29,343
# I really wish
that you could see #

932
01:08:29,443 --> 01:08:31,425
# I... #

933
01:08:44,574 --> 01:08:47,090
You all right?

934
01:08:48,678 --> 01:08:50,013
Did you write that
for your husband?

935
01:08:50,113 --> 01:08:51,349
Yes, I did,

936
01:08:51,449 --> 01:08:52,917
and he didn't like it.

937
01:08:53,017 --> 01:08:54,585
What an idiot.

938
01:08:54,685 --> 01:08:56,688
Yeah, he's an idiot.

939
01:09:22,852 --> 01:09:26,172
Come on away to London with me.

940
01:09:26,272 --> 01:09:28,826
Come on, we'll write loads of
songs and live in a nice flat.

941
01:09:28,926 --> 01:09:30,460
You can bring Ivonka over,
it'll be brilliant.

942
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,895
Come on.

943
01:09:31,996 --> 01:09:33,630
Yeah, we'll go to London

944
01:09:33,731 --> 01:09:35,834
and no one will ever
find us again.

945
01:09:35,934 --> 01:09:37,034
- No one.
- No one.

946
01:09:37,135 --> 01:09:38,470
We'll have a brilliant band.

947
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:40,606
We'll sell out all the places
and it'll be great.

948
01:09:40,706 --> 01:09:42,441
And we'll make
an album together?

949
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:43,976
I'd love that, come on.

950
01:09:44,077 --> 01:09:45,444
Yeah, and, and I'll do

951
01:09:45,544 --> 01:09:46,545
the backing vocals on it?

952
01:09:46,646 --> 01:09:47,781
Yeah, and play
the piano.

953
01:09:47,881 --> 01:09:49,048
Mm-hmm.

954
01:09:49,148 --> 01:09:50,483
Come on, I'm serious.

955
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:52,585
Can I bring my mother?

956
01:09:58,192 --> 01:10:01,187
Well, we should go back
to work.

957
01:10:03,598 --> 01:10:05,600
- Yeah.
- Okay.

958
01:10:25,323 --> 01:10:26,926
What day is it today?

959
01:10:28,594 --> 01:10:30,546
Monday.

960
01:10:30,646 --> 01:10:33,667
I think it's time we did
the, uh, the car test.

961
01:10:33,767 --> 01:10:35,669
What's the car
test, Eamon?

962
01:10:35,769 --> 01:10:37,805
We've been listening
back on these, uh,

963
01:10:37,905 --> 01:10:39,340
big studio speakers.

964
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,577
So it's time we had a go
on some shitty speakers.

965
01:10:42,677 --> 01:10:43,746
So...

966
01:10:43,846 --> 01:10:44,913
All right, let's go.

967
01:10:45,013 --> 01:10:47,182
Let's go for a spin
and have a listen in me car.

968
01:10:47,282 --> 01:10:48,450
Great, man.

969
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:49,786
- Yeah.
- Go have a ride, yeah?

970
01:10:49,886 --> 01:10:51,838
Let's go.

971
01:10:51,938 --> 01:10:55,487
We'll clear this up later.

972
01:10:56,526 --> 01:10:58,479
Timmy!

973
01:10:58,579 --> 01:11:01,011
Timmy!

974
01:11:01,111 --> 01:11:02,067
Come on.

975
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:04,169
Beauty.

976
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,312
Beauty.

977
01:11:13,881 --> 01:11:15,883
All right.

978
01:13:29,653 --> 01:13:30,939
There they are.

979
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:33,242
Listen, man, fucking...

980
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:34,642
- Well done.
- It sounds fucking brilliant.

981
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,779
- Thanks a lot for your help.
- Lots of luck with those.

982
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:38,215
- Nice one.
- I just pressed the buttons.

983
01:13:38,315 --> 01:13:39,282
It was great.

984
01:13:39,382 --> 01:13:40,516
Nice, man, thank you.

985
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:42,486
- Cool.
- You two go and get some sleep.

986
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:43,553
Right, nice one.

987
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:46,972
- And thanks very, very much.
- See you.

988
01:13:52,998 --> 01:13:54,533
So this is it.

989
01:13:54,633 --> 01:13:56,501
- Yeah.
- We did it.

990
01:13:56,601 --> 01:13:58,237
It sounds great.

991
01:13:58,337 --> 01:13:59,471
It does, doesn't it?

992
01:13:59,571 --> 01:14:00,640
Could I have one?

993
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,075
- Yeah, yeah, totally.
- Thank you.

994
01:14:02,175 --> 01:14:04,494
I've got to
go this way.

995
01:14:04,594 --> 01:14:06,529
Really.

996
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:08,532
Where you going?

997
01:14:08,632 --> 01:14:10,584
Home.

998
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,054
You don't want
to come back?

999
01:14:13,154 --> 01:14:14,156
I'll make you breakfast.

1000
01:14:14,256 --> 01:14:15,790
- We could listen to the CD, no?
- No.

1001
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:19,228
I have to go see Ivonka
and organize things.

1002
01:14:19,328 --> 01:14:20,496
So do you.

1003
01:14:20,596 --> 01:14:21,631
Yeah.

1004
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:23,133
You're leaving.

1005
01:14:23,233 --> 01:14:25,185
To London.

1006
01:14:25,285 --> 01:14:26,670
What do you have
to organize?

1007
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:27,838
What's, what's that about?

1008
01:14:27,938 --> 01:14:30,809
I, I spoke to my
husband last night.

1009
01:14:30,909 --> 01:14:32,076
He's coming over.

1010
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,978
Ah, brilliant.
Fair play-That's great.

1011
01:14:34,078 --> 01:14:35,713
- I'm really happy for you.
- It's good. Yeah.

1012
01:14:35,813 --> 01:14:37,964
We'll try to
make it work.

1013
01:14:38,064 --> 01:14:39,285
It's for the best.

1014
01:14:39,385 --> 01:14:40,586
Yeah.

1015
01:14:40,686 --> 01:14:42,655
Come back and hang out,
have a cup of tea.

1016
01:14:42,755 --> 01:14:44,091
It's the last day.
We'll hang out.

1017
01:14:44,191 --> 01:14:46,702
Whatever, breakfast, whatever.

1018
01:14:46,802 --> 01:14:47,827
Listen to the tunes.

1019
01:14:47,927 --> 01:14:49,796
Or you can come over later,
whatever.

1020
01:14:49,897 --> 01:14:51,883
For what?

1021
01:14:51,983 --> 01:14:53,634
What do you mean, what?

1022
01:14:53,734 --> 01:14:55,669
Just hang, just come
and hang out.

1023
01:14:55,769 --> 01:14:57,306
But we done our work.

1024
01:14:57,406 --> 01:14:58,640
Why would I go over?

1025
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:01,718
We'd just hanky panky
If I come now.

1026
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:04,113
What?

1027
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:06,215
Hanky panky?

1028
01:15:06,949 --> 01:15:08,618
It won't be for hanky panky.

1029
01:15:08,718 --> 01:15:10,721
I know it would.

1030
01:15:12,723 --> 01:15:15,475
And that would be nice.

1031
01:15:15,575 --> 01:15:16,695
Would it?

1032
01:15:16,795 --> 01:15:18,897
- Hanky... Would it?
- Very interesting.

1033
01:15:18,997 --> 01:15:21,993
Be worthless though.

1034
01:15:25,305 --> 01:15:28,277
Come back later.

1035
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:32,313
Mmm.

1036
01:15:36,117 --> 01:15:37,919
Okay, I'll come.

1037
01:15:38,019 --> 01:15:39,288
Yeah?

1038
01:15:39,388 --> 01:15:40,555
I'll come later, yeah.

1039
01:15:40,655 --> 01:15:42,024
Brilliant.

1040
01:15:42,124 --> 01:15:43,192
You sure?

1041
01:15:43,292 --> 01:15:44,560
Brilliant.

1042
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:45,694
All right, then...

1043
01:15:45,794 --> 01:15:47,663
Cool. See you after.
Well done.

1044
01:15:47,764 --> 01:15:49,766
You, too.

1045
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:12,301
Well, what do you think?

1046
01:17:16,266 --> 01:17:18,383
You like it?

1047
01:17:18,483 --> 01:17:20,811
It's just a demo,
you know...

1048
01:17:20,911 --> 01:17:22,240
It's fucking brilliant.

1049
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:23,508
Really?

1050
01:17:23,609 --> 01:17:25,561
Fantastic stuff.

1051
01:17:25,661 --> 01:17:28,565
That'll be a hit, no question.

1052
01:17:28,665 --> 01:17:31,129
When are you off?

1053
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:33,119
What?

1054
01:17:33,219 --> 01:17:35,855
Well, I've a few hundred quid
for you

1055
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:38,410
for a deposit on a place.

1056
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:40,461
Going to come over
and see you

1057
01:17:40,561 --> 01:17:42,563
when you're settled in.

1058
01:17:43,798 --> 01:17:47,032
When do you think
you'll be able to go?

1059
01:17:47,836 --> 01:17:49,738
I'm going tomorrow, Dad.

1060
01:17:49,838 --> 01:17:51,790
Good man.

1061
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:53,510
About time.

1062
01:17:57,514 --> 01:17:59,466
Will you be all right?

1063
01:17:59,566 --> 01:18:01,518
What do you mean?

1064
01:18:03,455 --> 01:18:07,692
I was all right for years
before you came along, wasn't I?

1065
01:18:07,792 --> 01:18:10,061
I don't have to go now.
I can put this thing off

1066
01:18:10,161 --> 01:18:11,897
- for a few months.
- Go.

1067
01:18:11,998 --> 01:18:13,499
And the best

1068
01:18:13,599 --> 01:18:15,234
of luck, son.

1069
01:18:15,334 --> 01:18:16,869
Thanks, Dad.

1070
01:18:16,969 --> 01:18:20,101
Make your ma proud.

1071
01:18:23,278 --> 01:18:25,179
Now play it again.

1072
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:28,514
Okay.

1073
01:18:28,783 --> 01:18:29,717
That's good.

1074
01:18:29,817 --> 01:18:31,287
Yeah. I recorded a few songs.

1075
01:18:31,387 --> 01:18:33,522
Oh, yeah? What are they like?

1076
01:18:33,623 --> 01:18:35,124
They're good.
I'm happy with them.

1077
01:18:35,224 --> 01:18:37,943
Great.

1078
01:18:38,043 --> 01:18:40,043
I've missed you.

Yeah, me, too.

01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:44,869
Do you want me
to meet you at the airport?

No. I'll come find you.

I'm glad you've decided to come.

Listen, I'm going
to get cut off here, all right?

Money's running out.

1085
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,019
Hurry up.

Oh. Great.

You don't know
where she is, do you?

1093
01:19:54,883 --> 01:19:56,084
Uh, she's-she's working.

Uh... Sorry.

01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:09,867
No telephone here, no.

01:20:09,967 --> 01:20:11,135
Damn.

Want to buy
the flowers?
