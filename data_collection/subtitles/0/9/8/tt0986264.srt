What's road? What's road?

244
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,780
With whom? With whom did you go?

245
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:32,514
- Alone.
- Alone.

246
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,623
Are you out of your mind? Are
you out of your bloody mind?

247
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,488
You were wondering alone in the city.

248
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,230
Hadn't you bothered
a bit about us? ldiot.

249
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,593
What's going on here? Did you listen?

250
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,831
lf he had been lost then how
can we able to look after him?

251
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:51,300
And who wrote this? Who
wrote this absent note?

252
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,771
You aren't able to write
properly, bloody, duffer, idiot.

253
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:56,674
You could pass if you are
able to write that much.

254
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,739
Who wrote this note, lshaan?

255
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:00,408
Speak, who wrote this?

256
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:05,386
lshaan, this is the last time l'm
asking you. Who wrote this absent note?

257
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:09,727
- Speak. Who wrote?
- No.

258
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:10,421
- Tell.
- No.

259
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:11,284
Tell me.

260
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,628
Class work and homework, haven't
any improvement in both of it.

261
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,800
Just like the last year.

262
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:28,979
Book is still his enemies. Like
read and write is punishment.

263
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,642
His English handwriting
seems to be Russian sometimes.

264
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,750
He repeat the mistakes without any reason. He's
always attentive towards the outside of the class.

265
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:41,559
All the time asking for
permission to go to the toilet.

266
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,627
l'm thirsty. l want to do pee.

267
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,595
Thirsty, pee... thirsty, pee.

268
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,492
Disturbs the whole class
with his silly pranks

269
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:53,430
And have you been through with his exam
papers. He boiled the eggs in every subject.

270
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,502
Did you send his exam papers?

271
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,939
On last Wednesday for parents
signature. Haven't returned till today.

272
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:05,714
There were a site, l tell you Mrs. Awasthi.
lnfect l sent a letter especially to meet you.

273
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:07,780
Look this.

274
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:17,190
Math's test. 3x9=3, enough. After
that he left all the questions.

275
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:21,594
Who would accept that he's the
younger brother of Yohaan Awasthi?

276
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,571
- Mr. Awasthi.
- Yes.

277
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:35,468
By the way this is the second
year of your son in third standard.

278
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:40,875
lf it's running such like that then l'm
sorry l wouldn't able to help you out.

279
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,485
Maybe he's having some problem.

280
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:47,518
What do you mean?

281
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:53,629
Maybe he... Some children are unlucky.

282
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:57,557
And there are special kind of
schools for these kind of children.

283
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:06,341
- Water, sir.
- Get a side.

284
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:07,878
l told you, move form there.

285
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:11,370
- 10 rupees sir... 10 rupee.
- Son of 10, 10 rupee.

286
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,885
Thinks my son is a retard.
She thinks my son isn't normal.

287
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,332
Err! They filled up the
class with 60 children.

288
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,357
Teacher wouldn't able to
pay attention on every child.

289
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:33,563
Bloody nonsense. ldiots.

290
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:40,771
What l hadn't done? l did the job
for the kids and left every thing.

291
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:45,271
l took the lessons by myself in morning
and evening, lshaan... lshaan... lshaan.

292
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:47,580
No Maya it's not your fault.

293
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,354
He wouldn't improve such like that.

294
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,422
Okay... okay, tomorrow l
come early in the morning.

295
00:44:56,894 --> 00:45:00,386
Thanks a lot Suresh. Thank you very
much. Good night... good night...

296
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:02,797
Done.

297
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,698
But in the middle of the term.

298
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:11,475
Suresh Kapdia's uncle is the
founder trusty of the school.

299
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:13,443
l'll submit the fee tomorrow
by meeting with the headmaster.

300
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,479
No, l'll not go. l'm not go to go.

301
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:18,380
lshaan, shut up. Have your food quietly.

302
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,212
Will not to go.

303
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:27,925
Let him finish this year then... l mean
Nando, he haven't stay without me till today.

304
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,256
Err! He'll have to inherit.

305
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,529
And wasn't you heard the
principal? They wouldn't allow him

306
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:34,394
...in the school next year. They'll
fail him again and expel him.

307
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:36,629
Then where will we go?

308
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,536
Look... look how he's staring?

309
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:47,539
No bloody regret on his face.

310
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,537
There at boarding school, they'll
straighten him up by force.

311
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,442
Today he asked Yohaan to write a note,
don't know what he'll do tomorrow?

312
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,454
Trust me Maya, l'm his father.

313
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,453
Fee is out of our budget
but we'll manage any how.

314
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:10,458
His term will starts
after the Deepawali.

01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:15,610
- Err! Why are you putting it there?
- This is the class work of the kids.

522
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:19,569
Then what happened? Holkar didn't put
it there. That place is for the books.

523
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,751
Then where do l put them.
Return them to the kids.

524
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:24,378
By the way are they for any use?

525
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:30,287
What the wreckage they are
making in your class Nikumbh?

526
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:32,823
They are the kids,
the have to make noise.

527
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,430
And if the kids wouldn't
show there emotions in

528
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:36,897
...the art class then
where else they would show them.

529
01:20:37,766 --> 01:20:42,260
That's alright. Just go easy. Headmaster
wants the discipline in the school. Discipline.

530
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:47,633
l heard that you were
singing the class yesterday.

531
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:50,344
And playing the flute.

532
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:52,970
Yes l was singing and playing the flute.

533
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:55,713
Kids happy so l'm happy.

534
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:58,611
But the children of this school isn't
like the children of that school.

535
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:01,317
What kind of children?

536
01:21:06,461 --> 01:21:07,587
You are teaching in tulips school.

537
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,355
Mentally retorted abnormal kids.

538
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:14,469
Teach the way you like in
that kind of school, it doesn't

539
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:16,630
...makes any difference. No future
wouldn't be made of that kids.

540
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:20,342
No serious teaching. This
is a formal school, your

541
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:23,411
...singing, dancing style
wouldn't be appreciated over here.

542
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:25,174
Here we prepare the kids for the race of life.
Kids have to compete, succeed. Make a future.

543
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:34,756
Three rules of our school.
Unity, faith and discipline.

544
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:38,817
Three rules of success, the
way of complete education.

545
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:42,689
Hail Hitler.

546
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,569
Tevari-ji now you have to learn German.

547
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:01,875
What happen lshaan?

548
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:06,388
Okay... Okay... Okay... Okay...

549
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:07,184
lt's okay.

550
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:40,453
Err! Listen, where is your friend?

551
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:45,248
Sir, don't know sir. He was
here by now, suddenly he ran off.

552
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,964
He saw his new boring art teacher.

553
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:51,660
No... No sir, he went to the
dinning hall for the lunch.

554
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,537
What is your name friend?

555
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:57,266
Rajan Dhamodhran sir.

556
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:00,008
Rajan tell me one thing,
what is the matter of lshaan?

557
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:02,978
- Sir.
- ls he having some problem?

558
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,445
He's afraid all the time.

559
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:07,374
- He wants to go home.
- Why?

560
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:10,841
- He's a new boy sir.
- ln the middle of the year.

561
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:14,556
He's having a problem.
As much he can try but he

562
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:17,923
...can't read and write. He
has been punished all the time.

563
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,493
Red marks all over the book. What to do?

564
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:43,267
You play here, l'll be right back.
Ok?

565
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:15,259
Are you coming from somewhere
after cutting onions?

566
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:23,900
The human is...
- worse then animals.

567
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:24,609
l know that.

568
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:25,940
And blind too.

569
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:28,181
Away from the inner beauty.

570
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:30,946
Who you're confronting these days?

571
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:34,378
Myself.

572
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:37,286
After so long, l'm seeing
myself in the mirror.

573
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:39,425
So is there someone to
show you the mirror?

574
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:41,655
That's what l always ask you to.

575
01:26:41,996 --> 01:26:43,293
You have a nice face.

576
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:47,894
Jabeen, he's in danger.

577
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:50,937
Who?

578
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:54,940
Who?

579
01:26:56,744 --> 01:26:58,644
There's a boy in the school

580
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:02,412
He's 8-9 years old.

581
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:07,143
He doesn't do or speak anything,
always seems scared.

582
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:12,321
His eyes are like...
screaming for help.

583
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,222
l'm afraid he'll fall.

584
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:28,175
Let's go, it's time for the lesson.

585
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:29,207
Ok, lets go.

586
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:33,946
Hey, Sail, come. Do you know
what's the time of the show?

587
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:35,374
After two days.

588
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:38,916
Yes.
Excellent, let's go.

589
01:33:24,665 --> 01:33:26,189
Yes?
Hello.

590
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,562
My name's Ram Shankar Nikum.

591
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:30,267
l teach at New Era School.

592
01:33:32,506 --> 01:33:33,200
Come in.

593
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,275
Are these his 3rd standard books?
- Yes.

594
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:51,223
Who made this?

595
01:33:52,259 --> 01:33:52,725
lshaan did.

596
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:55,660
lshaan did?
Does he paint?

597
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:58,287
Yes, he loves to paint.

598
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:37,421
Can l have some water please?

599
01:36:02,723 --> 01:36:04,588
Why did you send him?

600
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:06,555
Why?

601
01:36:08,262 --> 01:36:09,251
There was no choice.

602
01:36:10,364 --> 01:36:11,888
Last year he failed in 3rd standard.

603
01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:13,530
Can you believe?
ln 3rd standard.

604
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:15,534
And there's no sign of
improvement.

605
01:36:15,636 --> 01:36:18,161
This, my elder son, he comes 1st
in every class every subject.

606
01:36:18,272 --> 01:36:19,239
And that other one...

607
01:36:21,275 --> 01:36:22,469
What do you think, what
his problem is?

608
01:36:22,576 --> 01:36:24,476
Problem? His attitude. What else?

609
01:36:24,578 --> 01:36:29,174
Towards studies, towards everything.
Always stubborn, always attitude.

610
01:36:30,317 --> 01:36:33,252
l'm asking about his problem,
but you're telling me the symptoms.

611
01:36:33,354 --> 01:36:35,379
You're telling me he has the fever,
that's l know already.

612
01:36:36,390 --> 01:36:37,618
l'm asking why is he having fever.

613
01:36:38,692 --> 01:36:39,886
What's the reason of the fever?

614
01:36:42,296 --> 01:36:43,320
Then you tell me.

615
01:36:44,698 --> 01:36:45,460
Tell me.

616
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:53,206
Have you noticed any pattern
in his mistakes in his lessons?

617
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:54,604
Pattern. What pattern?

618
01:36:54,742 --> 01:36:56,266
They all are mistakes.

619
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:57,542
Then you couldn't notice
the patterns.

620
01:37:05,686 --> 01:37:06,345
Look here.

621
01:37:08,289 --> 01:37:10,223
Here ''b'' is in place of ''d''
and ''d'' in place of ''b''

622
01:37:11,225 --> 01:37:13,352
Confusion among similar
looking alphabets.

623
01:37:14,261 --> 01:37:17,196
Here, he wrote ''s'' and ''r''
in reverse. Even more...

624
01:37:17,298 --> 01:37:17,923
Look here.

625
01:37:18,232 --> 01:37:20,200
This small ''h'' and small ''t''

626
01:37:20,301 --> 01:37:21,563
Mirror imaging.

627
01:37:23,237 --> 01:37:25,899
Animal, animal, animal. Three different
spellings on the same page.

628
01:37:27,274 --> 01:37:29,265
lt means, it's not the case that
he remembers one wrong spelling.

629
01:37:30,277 --> 01:37:32,336
He mixes similar looking words.

630
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:34,504
This ''t-o-p'' becomes ''p-o-t''

631
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:37,874
This ''s-o-l-i-d'' become ''s-o-i-l-d''.

632
01:37:40,287 --> 01:37:40,912
Why does he do that?

633
01:37:41,989 --> 01:37:43,513
ls he stupid, or lazy?

634
01:37:44,625 --> 01:37:45,319
No

635
01:37:46,293 --> 01:37:49,228
l think, he's having difficulty
in recognizing words.

636
01:37:52,233 --> 01:37:56,192
When you read ''a-p-p-l-e'' apple,
you imagine a red apple in your head.

637
01:37:56,604 --> 01:37:58,333
Maybe he can't read ''apple''

638
01:37:58,672 --> 01:37:59,934
That's why he can't
get the meaning as well.

639
01:38:02,243 --> 01:38:07,203
To learn, one has to know the sounds,
visual and meanings of words.

640
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:11,184
lshaan is lacking this
very important need.

641
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:14,187
To skip the studies.

642
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:27,931
Read this please.

643
01:38:31,639 --> 01:38:33,504
How can l read it?
lt's in Chinese.

644
01:38:33,641 --> 01:38:35,506
Try it.
Come on. Concentrate.

645
01:38:35,609 --> 01:38:37,907
What's this rubbish?

646
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:40,203
You're not behaving.

647
01:38:40,347 --> 01:38:41,405
You're being rascal.

648
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:52,649
That's how lshaan must be feeling.

649
01:38:54,228 --> 01:38:55,388
He couldn't understand
the words.

650
01:39:00,234 --> 01:39:03,260
This problem in studies
is called as ''Dyslexia''.

651
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:16,215
Sometimes child has some more
problems other then Dyslexia.

652
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:19,649
Like difficulty in understanding
multiple instructions.

653
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:23,185
Turn to page 65, chapter 9,
Para 4, line 2

654
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:24,188
Confusion...

655
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:28,352
Or Poor Final Gross Motus Skills.

656
01:39:28,462 --> 01:39:32,159
Does lshaan feel problems in
buttoning his shirt or tying his shoelace?

657
01:39:32,266 --> 01:39:33,255
Yes

658
01:39:33,367 --> 01:39:36,234
Can he catch the ball
when you throw it to him?

659
01:39:36,337 --> 01:39:38,862
He can never judge the ball.

660
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:42,204
Because he can't understand the size,
distance and speed all together.

661
01:39:42,343 --> 01:39:46,211
A ball, how big, from how far and
at what speed coming towards him.

662
01:39:46,347 --> 01:39:47,905
Until he analyze all this...

663
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:49,182
lt's too late.

664
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:56,547
Think about it.

665
01:39:57,424 --> 01:40:00,359
A child
Just 8-9 years old.

666
01:40:02,262 --> 01:40:04,423
Can't do day to day normal things.

667
01:40:04,531 --> 01:40:08,262
Can't do what other children
can do very easily.

668
01:40:09,403 --> 01:40:11,234
What could he go through then?

669
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,607
His self-confidence must have
been shattered.

670
01:40:17,277 --> 01:40:21,270
He must have been fighting by hiding
his inabilities under stubbornness.

671
01:40:21,382 --> 01:40:22,940
He must have been making a
hell out here.

672
01:40:26,553 --> 01:40:28,316
Thinking, that why should he tell the
world that he can't do things.

673
01:40:28,422 --> 01:40:30,253
Why shouldn't he get all that ignored
by just saying that he doesn't want to do.

674
01:40:30,424 --> 01:40:31,322
That's what children learn from the elders.

675
01:40:38,032 --> 01:40:40,262
And now he can't even
continue to fight that.

676
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:47,600
l'm sorry to say that
he has stopped painting.

677
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:57,008
lt's very sad.

678
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,446
Why only lshaan?

679
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:05,881
There's no answer to that.

680
01:41:06,326 --> 01:41:08,191
lt's a Neurological Disorder.
lt can happen to anyone.

681
01:41:08,295 --> 01:41:10,229
Sometimes it can be genetic.

682
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:14,323
To make it simple, there's just
some wiring problems in his brain.

683
01:41:15,469 --> 01:41:18,370
So you're saying that my son
isn't normal, he's mentally retarded.

684
01:41:19,373 --> 01:41:20,567
What kind of a person you are?

685
01:41:22,509 --> 01:41:24,409
Look this, Mrs. Awasti?

686
01:41:24,511 --> 01:41:27,207
This fast brain is playing with
thousands of thoughts with colors.

687
01:41:27,347 --> 01:41:29,247
Way more then yours and mine abilities.

688
01:41:29,349 --> 01:41:30,281
But what's the use of that?

689
01:41:30,384 --> 01:41:31,976
What are you looking into it?

690
01:41:32,286 --> 01:41:33,218
Then what should l look?

691
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,378
What will he become when
he'll grow up?

692
01:41:35,389 --> 01:41:36,879
How will he compete with
the world?

693
01:41:38,425 --> 01:41:39,915
Will l keep on feeding
him for whole of his life?

694
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:55,267
l know this.

695
01:41:56,376 --> 01:41:57,900
There's a cold world out there.

696
01:41:59,513 --> 01:42:03,347
Everyone wants to grow toppers
and rankers in their homes.

697
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,254
Everyone wants No. 1

698
01:42:08,355 --> 01:42:11,324
Doctor, engineer, management,
less then that is unacceptable.

699
01:42:17,231 --> 01:42:18,459
lsn't it?

700
01:42:20,234 --> 01:42:21,201
Think about this.

701
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:27,331
Every child has his own quality,
own expertise, own desire.

702
01:42:28,308 --> 01:42:29,240
But no,

703
01:42:30,377 --> 01:42:32,277
Everyone is busy stretching the
finger to make it long.

704
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,914
Keep on doing that.
No matter you break the very finger.

705
01:42:41,021 --> 01:42:42,488
What's are the options?
- No options.

706
01:42:43,423 --> 01:42:44,253
There's no way.

707
01:42:45,559 --> 01:42:47,959
lf you like horse to race, then
breed race horses, damn it.

708
01:42:48,495 --> 01:42:49,655
Why do you give birth to children?

709
01:42:52,633 --> 01:42:57,468
Putting the weight of your ambitions
on your child, is worse then child labor.

710
01:43:01,308 --> 01:43:02,605
And when the child can't
carry the weight...

711
01:43:06,346 --> 01:43:07,574
When you will understand?

712
01:43:07,681 --> 01:43:10,206
That every child has his own
capacity to lift the weight.

713
01:43:10,317 --> 01:43:12,285
He learns eventually.

714
01:43:12,386 --> 01:43:15,355
Every child has own pace.
Five fingers make a fist.

715
01:43:21,728 --> 01:43:25,391
Why are we dreaming to settle
these little ones in to the mainstream?

716
01:45:27,454 --> 01:45:31,550
Friends, l'm going to tell
a story today.

717
01:45:36,363 --> 01:45:37,295
A story about a boy.

718
01:45:42,402 --> 01:45:44,393
There was a boy, don't ask where.

719
01:45:44,504 --> 01:45:48,201
He couldn't read and write.
Even after so many tries.

720
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:51,573
He couldn't remember that ''y''
comes after ''x''.

721
01:45:51,712 --> 01:45:55,409
Words were his enemies,
used to dance in front of his eyes.

722
01:45:55,515 --> 01:45:59,383
They used to tease him by
dancing and moving around.

723
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:03,179
Studies used to make him tired.

724
01:46:05,225 --> 01:46:08,160
His mind was full, he was a starter bull,
and the alphabets were disco to him.

725
01:46:10,263 --> 01:46:11,423
He failed in the exams.

726
01:46:11,531 --> 01:46:13,465
He was a victim of the burden
of the studies.

727
01:46:13,567 --> 01:46:15,592
People called him an ass
and stupid.

728
01:46:15,702 --> 01:46:18,535
Boy took everything bravely.

729
01:46:18,638 --> 01:46:21,937
And one day, he did something genius.

730
01:46:22,275 --> 01:46:24,539
Everyone was shocked when
heard his theory.

731
01:46:24,678 --> 01:46:26,578
Tell me, who's that boy?

732
01:46:35,589 --> 01:46:36,556
Elbert Einstein.

733
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:38,915
Correct Rajan,
Albert Einstein.

734
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:40,386
Genius and great scientist.

735
01:46:40,494 --> 01:46:44,260
Who shocked the world with his
theory of relativity.

736
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:52,429
Now tell me what's this?

737
01:46:57,577 --> 01:47:00,910
No, no.
lt's not an ordinary helicopter.

738
01:47:01,648 --> 01:47:02,740
The great artist inventor,
Leonardo DiVinci

739
01:47:04,451 --> 01:47:07,511
Who?
- Leonardo DiVinci

740
01:47:07,621 --> 01:47:08,485
Yes,

741
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:11,250
he made this picture.

742
01:47:11,358 --> 01:47:12,325
A working sketch of a helicopter.

743
01:47:12,426 --> 01:47:13,450
But when?

744
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:14,527
ln the 15th century.

745
01:47:14,628 --> 01:47:17,256
400 years before the first
airplane could fly.

746
01:47:19,466 --> 01:47:23,300
Do you know, Leonardo DiVinci used
to have difficulties to read and write.

747
01:47:24,204 --> 01:47:25,432
He used to write like this.

748
01:47:44,257 --> 01:47:46,452
Can you make anything out of it?

749
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:55,563
Now read it.

750
01:47:57,237 --> 01:48:01,537
My name is Ram Shankar Nikum.

751
01:48:09,216 --> 01:48:11,514
lshaan, turn on the light please.

752
01:48:20,527 --> 01:48:23,894
Who was the great person,
who lit the world with electricity?

753
01:48:24,197 --> 01:48:25,255
Edison.

754
01:48:26,533 --> 01:48:27,625
Thomas Edison.

755
01:48:27,734 --> 01:48:29,201
Correct lshaan.

756
01:48:30,504 --> 01:48:32,369
He too was a victim of ''abcd''.

757
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:34,204
Sit down lshaan.

758
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:35,535
No leave the light on.

759
01:48:36,476 --> 01:48:38,273
Let Edison's light come on us.

760
01:48:48,321 --> 01:48:50,255
Everyone must know him.
- Abhishek Bachchan.

761
01:48:55,395 --> 01:48:58,193
He too used to have difficulties
in studies during childhood.

762
01:48:58,298 --> 01:49:00,198
Now see, he is a blast.

763
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:09,868
There are more examples.
Pablo Picasso, famous painter.

764
01:49:12,212 --> 01:49:14,305
He used to say, ''lt looks
like my uncle's nose in reverse. ''

765
01:49:18,218 --> 01:49:20,152
Who's the father of Mickey Mouse?
- Walt Disney.

766
01:49:20,253 --> 01:49:21,447
Correct.
Walt Disney.

767
01:49:21,555 --> 01:49:24,581
He was too confused about words,
so he put his art into cartoons.

768
01:49:27,227 --> 01:49:30,492
He used to write songs out of the
shame about his red report card.

769
01:49:31,331 --> 01:49:33,162
Agatha Christy, famous mystery book writer.

770
01:49:33,934 --> 01:49:36,869
Can you believe a writer, who was
unable to read in her childhood.

771
01:49:38,572 --> 01:49:42,201
But, why am l telling you all
this suddenly today?

772
01:49:45,278 --> 01:49:51,308
To show you that, there were gems
in the world who changed it.

773
01:49:52,252 --> 01:49:54,447
They were able to see
the world from their eyes.

774
01:49:55,255 --> 01:49:58,486
Their minds were a bit different.

775
01:49:58,592 --> 01:50:00,253
People came in their ways.

776
01:50:01,294 --> 01:50:02,352
But still they won.

777
01:50:02,462 --> 01:50:04,521
And they won like that the whole
world saw it in an awe.

778
01:50:06,433 --> 01:50:10,233
Out today's art class will be
dedicated to all those geniuses.

779
01:50:11,738 --> 01:50:14,935
We will step out remembering them.

780
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:16,936
And we'll make something different.
Anything.

781
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:19,571
Pick anything you like,
rock, wood, junk, anything.

782
01:50:22,248 --> 01:50:23,977
Come on, move towards the door.

783
01:50:37,030 --> 01:50:38,554
lshaan, one minute.

784
01:50:40,367 --> 01:50:40,924
Rajan, you can go.

785
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:54,007
Do you know there was another name
among all those l mentioned?

786
01:50:57,417 --> 01:51:00,250
Because that name is not that great.

787
01:51:02,956 --> 01:51:05,516
But he too had the same problem.

788
01:51:09,295 --> 01:51:13,197
That name is Ram Shankar Nikum.

789
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:23,300
l too had difficulties in
reading and writing.

790
01:51:24,477 --> 01:51:26,308
My father never understood me.

791
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:30,975
He thought l was being naughty,
and wasn't paying attention.

792
01:51:32,519 --> 01:51:35,215
He thought l would not succeed
in my future.

793
01:51:36,723 --> 01:51:38,623
What a duffer and idiot could become?

794
01:51:42,562 --> 01:51:46,362
Whatever l am today,
l'm in front of you lshaan.

795
01:51:52,972 --> 01:51:53,563
Shall we go?

796
01:51:56,342 --> 01:51:57,900
Did you go to my home?

797
01:53:31,604 --> 01:53:33,265
Hey, it's moving.

798
01:53:55,562 --> 01:53:57,291
Can it fly?

799
01:53:58,031 --> 01:53:59,259
Will it?

800
01:53:59,365 --> 01:54:01,196
Who made it?

801
01:55:00,393 --> 01:55:01,417
ls Principal present?

802
01:55:01,527 --> 01:55:02,494
Yes sir.
- Ok, stay seated.

803
01:55:15,241 --> 01:55:16,469
l wanted to talk about a student.

804
01:55:17,577 --> 01:55:18,566
lshaan Awasti, 3rd ''D''

805
01:55:18,711 --> 01:55:19,643
He's a new student.

806
01:55:21,381 --> 01:55:23,212
Some other teachers are
also complaining about him.

807
01:55:25,752 --> 01:55:27,344
l don't think he could
even complete a year.

808
01:55:29,422 --> 01:55:31,356
No sir, he's a smart boy.

809
01:55:32,325 --> 01:55:34,225
He has just come problem
in reading and writing.

810
01:55:34,694 --> 01:55:36,252
You know about ''Dyslexia''.

811
01:55:41,334 --> 01:55:43,302
You've made our job easy.

812
01:55:43,403 --> 01:55:47,339
l was confused what to tell his father.
He came through our trustees.

813
01:55:48,374 --> 01:55:49,238
Good, good.

814
01:55:50,276 --> 01:55:52,437
Then Special School is perfect for him.
lsn't it?

815
01:55:53,613 --> 01:55:55,308
No sir,

816
01:55:55,448 --> 01:55:56,642
He's a child with above
average intelligence.

817
01:55:59,385 --> 01:56:01,148
He has full right to study
in a normal school.

818
01:56:01,254 --> 01:56:02,915
He just needs a little help from us.

819
01:56:05,258 --> 01:56:11,219
All children around the world having
any problem study in normal school.

820
01:56:12,598 --> 01:56:16,295
And these children have right
to study in any normal school.

821
01:56:21,207 --> 01:56:23,266
Under the law of rights of
education, every child gets this right.

822
01:56:25,712 --> 01:56:29,170
lt's another thing that there are less
schools who don't follow this law.

823
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:35,243
Nikum, tell me one thing.
How will this boy manage here?

824
01:56:38,291 --> 01:56:41,192
He will.
Only if teachers help him a bit.

825
01:56:41,294 --> 01:56:43,194
Where's the time that teachers have?

826
01:56:43,329 --> 01:56:47,265
To attend one child
among 40 children?

827
01:56:47,367 --> 01:56:48,299
lmpossible.

828
01:56:48,401 --> 01:56:50,232
Sir, it won't take as much time
as you think.

829
01:56:51,337 --> 01:56:54,238
2-3 hours a week.

830
01:56:55,341 --> 01:56:58,276
And he has to just pass all these
subjects,

831
01:56:58,778 --> 01:57:00,268
his real destination is something else.

832
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:06,180
So, all the subjects that we teach
are useless but yours isn't.

833
01:57:06,285 --> 01:57:10,221
No, sir, l didn't mean that.

834
01:57:17,563 --> 01:57:19,929
Please sir, look at his painting.

835
01:57:26,572 --> 01:57:28,563
lt's a battlefield, soldier digs a mine

836
01:57:28,708 --> 01:57:31,939
and turned the page and
escaped while digging.

837
01:57:32,278 --> 01:57:36,874
What an idea? Confident brush
strokes, such bold use of colors.

838
01:57:36,983 --> 01:57:38,280
Very bold.

839
01:57:40,219 --> 01:57:44,383
Look at this sir, a flip book,
story about getting away from home.

840
01:57:46,492 --> 01:57:49,256
What an idea?
From just an 8 years old boy.

841
01:57:51,264 --> 01:57:54,529
Sir, there are a few who
could think out of the way.

842
01:57:55,301 --> 01:57:58,668
Sir, just one chance.
He needs this chance.

843
01:57:58,971 --> 01:58:00,461
Or he'll loose his faith.

844
01:58:03,276 --> 01:58:04,470
What do you want from me?

845
01:58:05,511 --> 01:58:09,345
For some time, his spellings and
writing should be ignored.

846
01:58:10,383 --> 01:58:12,408
We should take his tests orally.

847
01:58:12,518 --> 01:58:15,214
Education is real be it
oral or written.

848
01:58:15,321 --> 01:58:17,255
By the time, l'll also work
on his reading and writing.

849
01:58:17,356 --> 01:58:19,153
That will be improved gradually.

850
01:58:24,630 --> 01:58:30,159
l don't know, if l'm doing a permanent
damage by following a temporary teacher.

851
02:00:35,561 --> 02:00:37,324
Now add 3

852
02:00:39,498 --> 02:00:40,897
Very good, now add 5

853
02:00:43,035 --> 02:00:44,002
What did you get?

854
02:00:45,338 --> 02:00:47,306
Very good, now subtract 11

855
02:02:10,456 --> 02:02:13,482
There's a question. Have you ever
painted after you finished your school.

856
02:02:14,327 --> 02:02:15,259
What?

857
02:02:21,233 --> 02:02:23,224
Painting competition.
For students, teachers, everyone.

858
02:02:30,376 --> 02:02:32,310
Seriously, what's the meaning or art.

859
02:02:33,312 --> 02:02:35,542
lt's meant to release your
emotions.

860
02:02:36,382 --> 02:02:39,647
lf you're happy, your hand will
reach all bright colors.

861
02:02:40,519 --> 02:02:43,977
Lunch was bad, you'll end up
filling with all dark and dull colors.

862
02:02:51,297 --> 02:02:51,888
l'll be back in two minutes, friends.

863
02:02:59,338 --> 02:03:00,327
Sorry, there's a little space.

864
02:03:04,410 --> 02:03:05,877
How come you're here?

865
02:03:06,212 --> 02:03:07,406
l was passing by.

866
02:03:08,214 --> 02:03:10,239
Have you met lshaan?
- No, not yet, l will meet him.

867
02:03:11,250 --> 02:03:12,308
First l needed to talk to you.

868
02:03:16,322 --> 02:03:18,882
My wife has been surfing internet
for a few days.

869
02:03:20,226 --> 02:03:22,319
She has read all the information
about ''Dyslexia''

870
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:25,219
We just wanted to you tell you that.

871
02:03:25,998 --> 02:03:27,329
Why did you want to tell me?

872
02:03:29,301 --> 02:03:34,898
So you don't mistake us as parents
who don't care about their children.

873
02:03:38,611 --> 02:03:42,206
To care.
lt necessary Mr. Awasti.

874
02:03:44,383 --> 02:03:46,351
lt has the power to cure.

875
02:03:47,319 --> 02:03:49,617
lt's a medicine that relieves pain.

876
02:03:52,391 --> 02:03:55,485
lt's a security that child thinks
someone cares about him.

877
02:03:57,263 --> 02:03:59,254
One hug, or one lovely kiss.

878
02:04:00,266 --> 02:04:02,666
To show that you care.

879
02:04:04,236 --> 02:04:06,261
To tell him, ''Son l love you''.

880
02:04:08,307 --> 02:04:13,506
''lf you have any worries,
you can come to me''.

881
02:04:13,612 --> 02:04:16,308
''lt's ok if you made a mistake,
l'm there for you. ''

882
02:04:19,251 --> 02:04:21,219
To care.

883
02:04:24,256 --> 02:04:25,587
lsn't it what's called ''to care''?

884
02:04:38,237 --> 02:04:42,333
l'm happy to hear that you
think you care.

885
02:04:52,651 --> 02:04:54,380
l'll leave now.

886
02:04:56,355 --> 02:04:58,323
Mr. Awasti,

887
02:04:59,024 --> 02:05:02,289
Has your wife read about
Solomon lslands on internet?

888
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:07,231
l don't know.

889
02:05:13,239 --> 02:05:19,235
for farming, they don't cut the trees.
lnstead, they stand around the tree

890
02:05:19,345 --> 02:05:24,180
and start shouting at him,
cursing at him.

891
02:05:28,354 --> 02:05:32,882
ln some days,
the tree gets weak.

892
02:05:34,293 --> 02:05:35,555
And dies by itself.

893
02:07:27,740 --> 02:07:32,905
There has been great gems
in the world who changed it.

894
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:38,943
They were able to see
the world from their eyes.

895
02:07:41,420 --> 02:07:42,546
Their minds were a bit different.

896
02:07:43,656 --> 02:07:47,285
People didn't like that and
they came in their ways.

897
02:07:49,695 --> 02:07:51,356
But still they won.

898
02:07:52,665 --> 02:07:56,465
And they won like that the whole
world saw it in an awe.

899
02:09:16,315 --> 02:09:17,407
What a fair they have arranged?

900
02:09:19,318 --> 02:09:20,250
Look, l have arrived.

901
02:09:39,204 --> 02:09:41,172
Where's your lshaan?
l've been dying to meet him.

902
02:09:42,307 --> 02:09:43,535
l don't know,
l can't see him.

903
02:09:44,510 --> 02:09:45,909
Rajan, where's lshaan?

904
02:09:46,211 --> 02:09:49,271
l don't know sir,
he left hostel before everyone.

905
02:09:50,315 --> 02:09:51,247
Really?

906
02:09:59,324 --> 02:10:01,554
Hey Nikum, you've pulled
me into this too.

907
02:10:01,693 --> 02:10:04,296
You should try this,
it's fun.

908
02:10:04,296 --> 02:10:06,287
No way, l can't do this
painting thing.

909
02:10:10,602 --> 02:10:13,298
l will put so many alphabets
and fill it will alphabets.

910
02:10:16,575 --> 02:10:18,600
l've come here only for headmaster
to see my presence.

911
02:10:18,744 --> 02:10:22,339
l will be here for 5-10 minutes only.

912
02:10:22,447 --> 02:10:23,573
lt's an honor for us that
you've come.

913
02:10:23,682 --> 02:10:25,274
Where l have to sit?

914
02:10:25,384 --> 02:10:27,249
Children will show your sitting place.

915
02:10:27,352 --> 02:10:30,253
Children, come here.

916
02:10:30,589 --> 02:10:32,352

921
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:43,351
No sir, he must be with Rajan.

922
02:12:22,968 --> 02:12:23,935
Where's he?

923
02:12:24,303 --> 02:12:28,364
l don't know sir, as l said earlier
he left before everyone.

924
02:13:14,319 --> 02:13:16,617
Where had you been?
Come here, sit.

925
02:13:21,426 --> 02:13:22,518
Do you have colors?

926
02:15:49,374 --> 02:15:52,366
Sir, haven't you left yet?
You were leaving in 5 minutes.

927
02:15:56,448 --> 02:15:57,312
What are you painting?

928
02:15:58,283 --> 02:16:00,252
lt's a frog, duck and a banana.

929
02:16:00,252 --> 02:16:02,277
ls it a frog?

930
02:17:45,557 --> 02:17:46,615
How's my painting?
Look at it.

931
02:17:49,227 --> 02:17:52,196
Absolutely beautiful sir.
First prize sir.

932
02:20:43,001 --> 02:20:45,469
Amazing!
What a wonderful morning.

933
02:20:46,971 --> 02:20:51,271
Going through the colored
glasses of windows we reached

934
02:20:51,409 --> 02:20:52,671
our childhood.

935
02:20:53,011 --> 02:20:54,569
Praise to be God's.

936
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:57,477
l saw other's childhoods too.

937
02:21:00,285 --> 02:21:02,913
He will take compulsory
lessons from Nikum Sir.

938
02:21:03,221 --> 02:21:05,382
lsn't it Joy Sir?

939
02:21:08,326 --> 02:21:11,193
But not only me, Sen and Tiwari
Sir will too,

940
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:13,924
these two had bad paintings as well.

941
02:21:16,501 --> 02:21:17,525
All right.

942
02:21:18,336 --> 02:21:21,464
By Nikum, l just remember.

943
02:21:21,573 --> 02:21:25,669
That we won't have to look
for a new art teacher.

944
02:21:26,244 --> 02:21:31,580
Nikum sir, along with Tulip School,
will also teach in our school.

945
02:21:44,295 --> 02:21:47,890
No, what you have been waiting for...

946
02:21:48,266 --> 02:21:49,665
l'm going to announce that.

947
02:21:50,969 --> 02:21:53,665
Let me come to the results
of the Art Fair.

948
02:21:54,506 --> 02:21:58,602
Our special guest Madam Lalita
was in a fix.

949
02:22:03,281 --> 02:22:10,210
lt was a tie. She wanted to award
both paintings to be the best.

950
02:22:10,555 --> 02:22:14,924
That wasn't possible.
Because the winner painting

951
02:22:16,261 --> 02:22:21,893
l thought that painting will become the
front cover of the school's yearbook.

952
02:22:22,734 --> 02:22:24,497
Now, there can't be two
front covers.

953
02:22:25,336 --> 02:22:28,305
So what to do now?

954
02:22:30,275 --> 02:22:32,539
Madam was in deep confusion.

955
02:22:33,244 --> 02:22:36,270
After thinking a lot she
came to a conclusion.

956
02:22:37,315 --> 02:22:41,649
She selected the student
leaving the teacher.

957
02:22:44,355 --> 02:22:45,515
Yes children.

958
02:22:45,623 --> 02:22:49,559
Your Nikum sir has been defeated.

959
02:22:52,964 --> 02:22:56,297
And the student who defeated him

960
02:22:57,402 --> 02:23:04,331
Little, 9 years old,
lshaan Nandkishore Awasti.

961
02:23:46,250 --> 02:23:47,410
Applause.

962
02:25:59,550 --> 02:26:03,452
Here's your lshaan
and here's his painting.

963
02:26:04,655 --> 02:26:06,589
Just look at it, what
a masterpiece.

964
02:26:07,425 --> 02:26:11,327
He's a very talented boy.
l'm really happy to have him.

965
02:26:12,230 --> 02:26:13,925
Have you met his teachers?

966
02:26:14,232 --> 02:26:15,199
No sir.

967
02:26:15,299 --> 02:26:17,893
Please go ahead and meet them,
they'll give the progress report.

968
02:26:44,228 --> 02:26:46,662
First we thought something was
wrong, he won't be staying here.

969
02:26:47,365 --> 02:26:51,267
But what improvement he made.

970
02:26:51,369 --> 02:26:55,965
What a pace to pick-up he has.
Wonderful. Here's his progress report.

971
02:27:06,951 --> 02:27:08,885
l can't believe all this.
Thank you.

972
02:27:38,983 --> 02:27:41,213
What?
What happened?

973
02:27:44,255 --> 02:27:46,883
l can't find words to
thank you.

974
02:27:54,565 --> 02:27:56,260
He's lovely boy.

975
02:27:56,367 --> 02:27:58,198
Just look after him.

976
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:30,497
Come back early
after holidays.
