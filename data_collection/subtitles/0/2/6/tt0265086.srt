1
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,741
There.

2
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,945
Technicals, nine o'clock.

3
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,138
Oh, shit! Did you see that?

4
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:09,441
Chief, we got unarmed civilians
getting shot down here at nine o'clock.

5
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:12,812
I got it, Matt.
I don't think we can touch this.

6
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,150
This food is the property
of Mohamed Farrah Aidid!

7
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,489
Go back to your homes!

8
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,258
Command, Super 64...

9
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:26,059
...we got militia shooting civilians
at the food distribution center.

10
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,400
Request permission to engage.

11
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,800
Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.

12
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,804
Negative, command.

13
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,568
U.N. 's jurisdiction, 64.
We cannot intervene.

14
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,337
-Return to base. Over.
-Roger.

15
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,674
64 returning.

16
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,222
Ready, Mr. Atto.

17
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,538
Leaving.

18
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,101
Sir.

19
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,531
Keep Driving!

20
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,642
I'm going to be late.

21
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,088
Call you back.

22
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,402
General Garrison?

23
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,840
No, thanks. I got one.

24
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,806
But these are Cuban.

25
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,046
Bolivar Belicoso.

26
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,470
So is this.

27
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,977
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.

28
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:11,530
I see not catching Aidid
is becoming a routine.

29
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:15,400
We weren't trying to catch Aidid.
We were trying to catch you.

30
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,298
Me?

31
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,769
But am I that important?

32
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,730
I hardly think so.

33
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,933
-You're just a businessman.
-Trying to make a living.

34
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,873
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

35
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,408
You've been here, what?

36
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,545
Six weeks?

37
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,786
Six weeks
you are trying to catch the general.

38
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,490
You put up reward posters.

39
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:49,263
$25,000. What is this?
Gunfight at the K.O. Corral?

40
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,495
It's the O.K. Corral.

41
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:58,170
Do you think bringing me in
will make him suddenly come to you?

42
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,572
Make him more agreeable?

43
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,140
You know where he sleeps.

44
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,243
You pay for his beds, much less his militia.

45
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:14,117
We're not leaving Somalia till we find him.

46
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,956
And we will find him.

47
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,657
Don't think because I grew up
without running water...

48
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,723
...I am simple, General.

49
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,134
I do know something about history.

50
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:30,142
See all this? It's simply shaping tomorrow.

51
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:34,769
A tomorrow without a lot
of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.

52
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,348
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I'm from Texas.

53
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:42,681
Mr. Garrison,
I think you shouldn't have come here.

54
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,189
This is civil war.

55
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,989
This is our war.

56
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:49,990
Not yours.

57
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,495
300,000 dead and counting.

58
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,067
That's not a war, Mr. Atto.
That's genocide.

59
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,166
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?

60
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,610
How'd he strike you?

61
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,877
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.

62
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,715
Yeah, he's a good catch.

63
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,553
It'll take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.

64
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,490
I'm not sure time is something we got
in great supply.

65
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,724
This isn't lraq, you know.
Much more complicated than that.

66
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,155
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.

67
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:31,397
They've been calling for situation reports
every morning this week.

68
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:36,805
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.

69
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,983
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.

70
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,812
I'll be your pilot today.

71
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,983
Federal regulations designate this
a non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.

72
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:56,392
Those in Mogadishu frequent flyer program
will earn 100 free credits.

73
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:01,124
And as always, the air sickness bags
are in the seatback in front of you.

74
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,001
Number one indications are good, Cliff.
Put her on two.

75
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,532
You're still clear.

76
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,019
61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.

77
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,417
I've got some bad news.

78
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,323
"Limo" is a word, Durant.
I don't want to hear about it.

79
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,258
It is not a word.
It's an abbreviation of a word.

80
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,434
"Limo" is a word in common usage.

81
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:39,298
That is the key phrase in Scrabble,
my good friend. Common usage.

82
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,464
If it's not in the dictionary it doesn't count!

83
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,634
It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!

84
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,871
It does have to be in the dictionary!

85
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,278
When we get back to the base,
it's coming off.

86
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,981
You touch my "limo"
and I'll spank you, Nightstalker.

87
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,178
Yeah, promises.

88
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,685
That's a nice beach down there.

89
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,447
How's the water?

90
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,828
Yeah, it's nice and warm.
And it's loaded with sharks.

91
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,493
-Name.
-Todd.

92
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,635
-Last name.
-Blackburn.

93
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,137
First name, Todd.

94
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,277
-So, what's it like?
-What's what like?

95
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,708
Mogadishu. The fighting.

96
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,716
-Serial number.
-72163427.

97
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,583
Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog."
No one calls it Mogadishu here.

98
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:35,058
Secondly, I wouldn't know
about the fighting, so don't ask.

99
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:36,650
Why not?

100
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,755
Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?

101
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,964
You look like you're about 12,
so let me explain something to you.

102
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,598
I have a rare and mysterious skill
that precludes me from doing missions.

103
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,043
Typing.

104
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,543
-Can you type?
-No.

105
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,008
-Date of birth.
-2-27-75.

106
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,854
Well, I'm here to kick some ass.

107
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,129
Let's bring it in.

108
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,576
Nice, man! Very smooth!

109
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,846
Single shot through the engine block.

110
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,214
Shit, that's a shame. That was a nice jeep.

111
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,276
Cease fire! Cease fire!

112
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,971
Check your weapons!

113
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,204
Sergeant Eversmann.

114
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,054
Private First Class Blackburn.

115
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,378
Yeah?

116
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,049
Reporting for duty.

117
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:18,060
Not to me. You're reporting to Lt. Beales.
He should be here somewhere.

118
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,356
Can I leave him with you?

119
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,390
Yeah, go ahead.

120
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,668
-You brought your weapon.
-Yes, sir.

121
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,801
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.

122
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,040
-When did you get in?
-Just now, Sergeant.

123
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,073
Hey, who's hungry?

124
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,937
What is this, Sarg'nt?
Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

125
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,200
-Not if General Garrison is asking.
-I'm asking.

126
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,602
Have a nice meal, Captain.

127
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,715
-Hey, man, there's a line.
-I know.

128
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,555
-Well, this isn't the back of it.
-Yeah, I know.

129
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,087
Sergeant. Sergeant.

130
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:23,989
What's going on here?

131
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,089
Some aerial target practice, sir.
Didn't want to leave it behind.

132
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,327
I'm talking about your weapon.

133
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,029
Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.

134
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,503
You know better than that.
Safety should be on at all times on base.

135
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,940
Well, this is my safety, sir.

136
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,715
Let it go, sir.
The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.

137
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,615
You Delta boys
are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.

138
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,317
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.

139
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:53,287
When we get on a five-yard line,
you're going to need my Rangers.

140
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,418
Y'all better learn to be team players.

141
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,686
We're done here.

142
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,799
Speak up. You say this is your safety?

143
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,808
Well, this is my boot, son.

144
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,081
And it will fit up your ass
with the proper amount of force.

145
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,913
-ls that a Jersey accent?
-I'm trying to do this, give me a break.

146
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,986
Take those sunglasses off.

147
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,455
Delta wants to wear Oakleys,
that's their business.

148
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,755
I don't want to see them on you again.

149
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,224
Is that a hot weapon?

150
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,934
Is that your move?

151
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,969
Is my hand on the piece?

152
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,773
I can mate you in three whatever you do.

153
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,543
I'd keep my eye on that queen
before counseling others.

154
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,149
Well, she's just lying in wait.

155
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,043
Yikes.

156
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,282
It's good. You're really improving.

157
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,388
If I may make a suggestion-- Observation.

158
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:05,585
Go ahead.

159
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,163
-It's a children's book, right?
-Right.

160
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:12,897
They are not supposed to scare
the living shit out of the children.

161
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,804
This is the part of the story
where our knight is slaying the dragon.

162
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,537
That's scary.
Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.

163
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,602
Thought you finished that last week.

164
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,509
You done?

165
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,576
Hey, we are at the 10-yard line here, men.

166
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,244
You understand?

167
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,247
Can you count? One, two, ten.

168
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,920
Okay? Where are my running backs?

169
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,925
Where are my running backs?

170
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,559
Hey, I didn't see you at church on Sunday.

171
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,702
You had something more important to do?

172
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,337
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.

173
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,704
I will make you believe, you understand?

174
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,356
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?

175
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,922
It was a good impression.
I recognize myself.

176
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,198
All right, carry on.

177
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,736
-I'd like a word, specialist.
-Sir.

178
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,899
You understand why we have
a chain of command, don't you?

179
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:25,975
Roger that, sir.

180
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,537
If you ever undermine me again,
you'll clean latrines with your tongue...

181
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,641
...till you taste no difference
between shit and French fries.

182
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,844
-Are we clear?
-Hoo-ah, sir.

183
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,851
All right.

184
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,752
Listen to this:

185
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:48,596
If one skinny kills another his clan owes
the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.

186
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,128
A hundred camels.

187
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,599
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

188
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,039
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

189
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,739
Is that really true, Lieutenant?

190
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,968
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes skinnies.

191
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,040
Sgt. Eversmann,
you really like the skinnies?

192
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:07,213
It's not that I like them or I don't like them.
I respect them.

193
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:11,550
See, what you guys fail to realize
is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.

194
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,592
He believes in this mission
down to his bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

195
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,093
Look, these people, they have no jobs...

196
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:23,427
...no food, no education, no future.

197
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:27,097
I just figure that, I mean,
we have two things that we can do.

198
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,696
We can help...

199
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,210
...or we can sit back and watch
the country destroy itself on CNN.

200
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,266
Right?

201
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,581
I don't know about you guys,
but I was trained to fight.

202
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,841
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?

203
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,715
Well, I think I was trained
to make a difference, Kurth.

204
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,254
Like the man said, he's an idealist.

205
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,084
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.

206
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,498
Stay away from the cans!

207
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,101
Die, gas-pumper!

208
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,568
Stay away from those cans!

209
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,605
No, no, stay back.

210
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,672
He's having a seizure.
Put something in his mouth.

211
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,687
John, it's okay. John, it's okay. It's okay.

212
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,901
Well, he'll be fine. But not in this army.

213
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,567
He's out of the game.
He's epileptic, going home.

214
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,707
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.

215
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,982
-You got a problem with that?
-No, sir.

216
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,145
It's a big responsibility.

217
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,781
Your men will look to you
to make the right decisions.

218
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,915
Their lives depend on it.

219
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,221
All right.

220
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,864
-Rangers lead the way, sir.
-All the way.

221
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,498
Good luck.

222
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:22,810
A meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet
may take place today at 1500 hours.

223
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,379
I say "may" because we all know by now...

224
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,850
...with the intel we get on the street,
nothing is certain.

225
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,888
This is actual intel
confirmed by three sources.

226
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,785
Two tier-one personalities may be present:

227
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:41,289
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor...

228
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,960
...and Abdi Hassan Awale, interior minister.

229
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,027
These are the guys we're after.

230
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,270
Today we go.

231
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,331
Same mission template as before.

232
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:55,672
1545, Assault Force Delta
will infiltrate the target building...

233
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,076
...and seize all suspects within.

234
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:02,185
Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks,
under command of Capt. Steele...

235
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,518
...will rope in at 1546...

236
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,023
...and hold a four-corner perimeter
around the target building.

237
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,891
No one gets in or out.

238
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,686
Extraction Force:

239
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,525
Lt. Colonel McKnight's humvee column
will drive in at 1547...

240
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:20,671
...on Hawlwadig Road
and hold just short of the Olympic Hotel.

241
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,339
Wait for the green light.

242
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,406
Now once Delta gives the word...

243
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:29,342
...McKnight's column will go to the target
and load the prisoners onto trucks.

244
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,315
Immediately after
the prisoners are loaded...

245
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:36,580
...the four Ranger chalks
will collapse back to the target building...

246
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,187
...Ioad up on humvees...

247
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,258
...and the entire ground force
will exfil the 3 miles back to base.

248
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,792
Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.

249
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:51,733
Now, I had requested light armor
and AC-130 Spectre gunships...

250
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:55,998
...but Washington, in all its wisdom,
decided against this.

251
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,039
Too high-profile.

252
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:01,439
So Black Hawks and Little Birds
will provide the air cover...

253
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,875
...with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.

254
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,481
Colonel Harrell.

255
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:10,018
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews
will coordinate the air mission...

256
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,355
...and I will coordinate ground forces.

257
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:14,989
Colonel Matthews.

258
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,359
Mission launch code word is lrene.

259
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,819
Questions?

260
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,399
Which building is it, sir?

261
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:28,531
We're confirming that now.
Somewhere near the Bakara market.

262
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:34,168
I don't choose the time or place
of their meetings.

263
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,143
I didn't say a word, sir.

264
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,849
Make no mistake,
once you're in the Bakara market...

265
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,318
...you're in an entirely hostile district.

266
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,220
Don't underestimate their capabilities.

267
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:49,052
We'll be in friendly neighborhoods
before we hit the market...

268
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:53,893
...so remember the rules of engagement:
No one fires unless fired upon.

269
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,329
Now, let's go get this thing done.

270
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,063
Good luck, gentlemen.

271
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,944
What's the matter, Danny?
Something you don't like?

272
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,340
No Spectre gunships,
daylight instead of night...

273
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:12,005
...afternoon when they're all fucked up
on khat...

274
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:16,348
...only part of the city Aidid can mount
a counter-attack on short notice....

275
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,622
-What's not to like?
-Life's imperfect.

276
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:23,556
For you two, circling above it at 500 feet,
it's imperfect.

277
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,458
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.

278
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:04,932
What the fuck, Smith?

279
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,804
-Well?
-Well, what?

280
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,440
We going?

281
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:14,575
-Why should I tell you that?
-Because I'm me.

282
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:19,611
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

283
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,342
-Bakara market.
-All right.

284
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:25,420
Listen, Smith, I need you to back me up
out there today, all right?

285
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,818
Keep sharp.

286
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,621
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.

287
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,196
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.

288
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,130
Nothing.

289
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:44,340
It's all in the grind, Sizemore.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

290
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,138
This, my friend, is a science.

291
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,846
You're looking at the guy
that believed the commercials.

292
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,176
About "be all you can be."

293
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,183
I made coffee through Desert Storm.

294
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,685
I made coffee through Panama,
while everyone else got to fight...

295
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,722
...got to be a Ranger.

296
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:07,262
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar"
or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"

297
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,627
-What happened to you?
-Ping-Pong accident.

298
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:14,994
What?

299
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,339
So guess what.

300
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,741
Your wish has been granted.
You're going out today.

301
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,573
You're fucking me.

302
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,282
You're taking my place
assisting the 60 gunner.

303
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,646
Sergeant Eversmann said
to get your stuff and get ready.

304
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,789
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

305
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,288
Oh, yeah.

306
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,151
Hell, yeah.

307
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:40,024
Grimesy, stick with Waddell
and give him ammo when he needs it.

308
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,395
-Hoo-ah?
-Hoo-ah.

309
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:45,993
I wouldn't worry about that. Generally
speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.

310
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:50,140
Just watch out for the sammys
throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.

311
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,468
Might even be fun.

312
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:55,445
D-boys do their thing now.
All we got to do is cover them.

313
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:58,414
Choppers going to cover us,
and we'll be all right.

314
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:03,152
Look, you guys,
this is my first time as chalk leader...

315
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,789
...but, this isn't our first time out together.
This is serious.

316
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,394
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.

317
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,224
We're elite.

318
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,058
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?

319
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,896
Any questions?

320
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,970
We're going to be okay.

321
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,642
Grab your gear. Let's move out.

322
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,993
You're not going to need that, dude.
We're not out there long enough.

323
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:02,378
You won't need that, either.

324
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,814
We'll be back before dark.

325
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,610
You might as well take dope
and beer instead.

326
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,083
What?

327
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,221
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

328
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:22,130
Let me tell you something, Grimes.
You got 50 pounds of gear.

329
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,425
You don't need another 12.

330
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:28,005
I don't know about you,
I don't plan on getting shot running away.

331
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,597
Well, I better keep mine in.

332
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:30,672
Grimes.

333
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,934
Most important thing:

334
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:36,343
Remember, when everyone is shooting,
shoot in the same direction.

335
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:48,319
Look at this.
He's taping his blood type to his boots.

336
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:52,020
-That's bad luck.
-No, it's smart.

337
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,127
All Delta do that.

338
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,924
That's bad luck too, man.

339
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:58,561
Come on, let's go.

340
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,973
It's a good thing
you're right-handed, Adonis.

341
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:11,310
-lf not, I don't know what you'd do.
-You're a funny guy, man.

342
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,749
-I'm not taking no death letter.
-We have a deal.

343
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,547
I'll give it to you back in an hour.

344
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:24,990
-Blackburn, you okay?
-Excited.

345
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:29,956
In a good way.
I've been training my whole life for this.

346
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,360
You ever shot at anybody before?

347
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:33,926
No, sir.

348
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,768
Me neither.

349
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,476
Think he's reliable?

350
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:16,071
Well, we'll see. It's his first time out.

351
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,623
-Tell him to turn his damn radio off.
-Yes, sir.

352
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,522
Tell him to turn his radio off.

353
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:31,585
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

354
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:42,566
Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy,
leave us a message. Thank you.

355
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,343
Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?

356
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,904
Pick up if you're there.

357
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:54,752
I'm just calling
to make sure everything's all right.

358
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,787
I'll call you in a couple hours.

359
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,757
You'd better not be sleeping.

360
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,056
Your move, Randy.

361
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,320
I'm missing you.

362
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,128
I love you, baby.

363
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:11,899
Hello? Hello?

364
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:15,366
Thanks, bud.

365
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,642
You know, it's kind of funny.

366
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:23,373
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

367
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,014
Could almost be a good place to visit.

368
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,550
Almost.

369
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,283
You don't think we should be here.

370
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:39,686
You know what I think?
It don't really matter what I think.

371
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:45,401
Once that first bullet goes past your head,
politics and all that shit...

372
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,697
...just goes right out the window.

373
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,500
I just want to do it right today.

374
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:54,976
Just watch your corner.
Get all your men back here alive.

375
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:24,038
Now, is this supposed to be the place,
or did his car just take a dump?

376
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,675
Abdi, come in.

377
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,645
Abdi, can you hear me? Is this the place?

378
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,178
Abdi, come in.

379
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,084
Can you hear me? Abdi.

380
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,852
Abdi, come in. Is this the place?

381
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,532
To my right side, above the cafe.

382
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,164
He says this is the building.

383
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:52,835
He's certain?

384
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,269
Abdi, you need to be sure.

385
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:56,871
Are you sure?

386
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:02,877
Well, it's down the road,
two blocks over on my left.

387
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,715
But there's too many militia.

388
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,616
If I go closer, they might shoot me.

389
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,115
Now he's saying the building's
a couple blocks down...

390
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,689
...but if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.

391
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,654
I'll fucking shoot him myself.

392
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:21,389
Tell him I want his skinny ass
parked in front of the building.

393
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,629
He's not getting paid
till he does exactly that.

394
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,033
Three miles to the target.
We're never off the main roads.

395
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:31,303
At K-four traffic circle, we turn north,
then east on National...

396
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:34,573
...and we wait until extraction of prisoners
is complete here.

397
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,613
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig...

398
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,208
...Ioad the prisoners, the assault-blocking
forces and bring them back.

399
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:43,113
Home in an hour. Okay?

400
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:46,620
There will be some shooting.
Bakara market is the Wild West.

401
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,956
But be careful what you shoot at.
People do live there.

402
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:51,823
Hoo-ah.

403
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:07,973
Last one of these guys shot himself
in the head playing Russian roulette.

404
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,957
Sir, the vehicle is stopped.

405
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:28,163
So this is the real deal now.
He's sure this time.

406
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:33,263
-He sounds scared shitless.
-Good. That's always a good sign.

407
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,843
That's it. That's our signal.

408
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,349
All right.

409
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,617
All QRF out of the airspace.

410
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,151
All QRF out of the airspace.

411
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:04,491
All units, lrene. I say again, lrene.

412
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:16,605
Check in when ready. Barber 51 up
and ready. Star 41 up and ready.

413
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,075
Irene!

414
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:20,216
Copy, Irene.

415
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:22,382
Fucking lrene!

416
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,097
Come on.

417
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,001
Good luck, boys.

418
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,509
Be careful.

419
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,004
No one gets left behind.

420
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,246
What's wrong?

421
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:56,247
Nothing. He's just never done that before.

422
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,722
Aw, fuck!

423
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,020
Let's go.

424
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,793
Sergeant Struecker. Let's roll.

425
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,322
Two minutes.

426
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,926
Two minutes.

427
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,667
Why are they burning tires?

428
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,809
Signals to the militia that we're coming!

429
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:47,314
Okay, 56, looks like there's some friendlies
on the ground.

430
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,443
Looks like I've got a tally on the voice.

431
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,258
One minute.

432
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,858
One minute.

433
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,600
What's that for?

434
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,874
Last rope, I almost bit my tongue off.

435
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,771
Touching base.

436
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,238
Two feet, one foot...

437
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,346
...clear.

438
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,443
Little birds touching down at target.

439
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,089
Ropes!

440
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,858
Go! Go! Go!

441
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,573
Chalk One troops are on the deck.
Chalk Two deployed.

442
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:00,080
This is McKnight.
Uniform 64 approaching staging area.

443
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,387
Down! Get down!

444
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,360
Down! Stay down!

445
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,295
Get down! Everybody down!

446
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,801
You, down!

447
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,027
Get down!

448
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,128
On the floor.

449
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:28,911
Let's go, let's go!

450
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,680
Grimesy! No fear!

451
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,748
Oh, yeah, right!

452
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:41,322
Rangers securing perimeter. Four corners.

453
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,253
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

454
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,920
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

455
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,328
Well, shoot back!

456
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,230
This is 64. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

457
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:58,104
This is 62, delivered chalks.
Going to cover pattern.

458
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:02,271
Super 62, take up an overhead pattern
to provide sniper cover. Over.

459
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:05,847
This is Super 65. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

460
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:15,150
Go, Blackburn, go! Go!

461
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:16,754
Go, Blackburn!

462
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,457
RPG!

463
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,131
Hold on!

464
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,296
No!

465
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,805
C-2, we got a man fallen.

466
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:41,907
Super-61, you're a sitting duck.

467
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,516
Take up overhead pattern
to provide sniper cover. Over.

468
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:48,020
Roger that. 61 coming out.

469
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:53,593
13, go ahead. I need you to move to
the north of the street.

470
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,425
Right to the north. Right there. Over.

471
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,498
Doc! Doc Schmid!

472
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,268
Come on!

473
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:04,030
Schmid, we got a man hit.

474
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,945
-Where's he hit?
-He's not. He fell.

475
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,981
-What?
-He fell.

476
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,015
Why aren't you shooting?

477
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,051
We're not being shot at yet!

478
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:19,687
How can you tell?

479
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,449
A hiss means it's close.

480
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:22,958
A snap means--

481
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:24,990
Now they're shooting at us!

482
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:34,965
Galentine!

483
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,403
Get me Captain Steele!
Get me Captain Steele!

484
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:45,111
Juliet 64, this is Juliet 25. Come in. Over.

485
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,080
Blackburn, can you hear me?

486
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:50,412
Juliet 64, this is 25. Come in. Over.

487
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,154
I can't get him!

488
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,649
Juliet 64, this is Chalk Four!
We've got a man down!

489
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,751
We need to get him out of here! Over.

490
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:01,923
This is 64. Say again, 25. Over.

491
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,191
We've got a man down! Over.

492
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,967
Take a breath, 25, and calm down. Over.

493
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:13,137
-Man down!
-Missed that, 25.

494
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,041
-Fuck it.
-Say again.

495
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,342
Matt, it's a long way to the humvees!

496
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:20,815
We'll get a stretcher in here.
Get him to the target building.

497
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,416
What did he say?

498
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:26,453
Super 61,
we got a man wounded on the ground.

499
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,226
-Stretcher!
-Get me a stretcher!

500
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,292
Come on. Stretcher.

501
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:33,828
Come on, come on!

502
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,290
Grab this end!

503
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,295
Let's go!

504
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,105
-All right.
-Go.

505
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,874
Get him to the humvees.
We'll hold down the corner.

506
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:46,739
Up to the humvees! Now!

507
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,475
Go! Go!

508
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,478
Keep moving, Grimes! Run!

509
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,020
-Secure!
-Let's move out!

510
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,288
Everybody up! Let's go!

511
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:06,860
Come on!

512
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,591
Let's go! Let's move!

513
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,294
-Grimes, run!
-All right.

514
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:21,043
C-2, this is Super 61,
beginning my orbit of the target area.

515
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,543
Chalk Four, clear for a clear. Coming in.

516
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:29,877
Kilo 11, this is 61,
providing cover for prisoner extract. Over.

517
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,815
Kilo 64, green light.

518
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:35,455
-Ready for extraction. Over.
-Roger that. Will relay.

519
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,958
That's it. We got them.

520
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,530
Uniform 64, ready for extraction. Over.

521
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:44,560
Roger that. There's the call.
Let's move out!

522
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:46,599
-Let's move out!
-Hold on.

523
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,319
-How much longer?
-Five minutes, sir.

524
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:12,987
-What?
-Five minutes.

525
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:14,690
Nothing takes five minutes!

526
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:21,637
What happened to him?

527
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:25,038
-He fell! Missed the rope!
-How'd he do that?

528
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:29,039
Put him in that humvee!
Grimes, give him a hand!

529
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:31,379
Let's go! Let's move it!

530
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:33,709
Move, move! Come on! Move!

531
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,251
Get him in there!

532
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:38,811
Get ready to move!

533
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,380
Go! Everybody move! Move!

534
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,022
Get the fuck up!

535
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,586
Grimes! Come on!

536
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,158
Grimes! Grimes!

537
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:58,837
Fuck this!

538
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,192
Fuck!

539
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,100
Let's go.

540
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:31,901
Come on!

541
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:34,142
Go! Move it!

542
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:35,367
Move!

543
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:38,742
Romeo 64, I need to send out
three humvees with a casualty.

544
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:40,874
He looks real bad. I need to evac now.

545
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,416
Roger that, Uniform 64.

546
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,178
We'll chop a team of gun ships to you.
Over.

547
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,813
Roger that.

548
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,487
I need extra security on these humvees!

549
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:52,653
I'll go. I'll take my team,
make sure they get back okay.

550
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:53,753
Do it.

551
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,056
Struecker, you're lead humvee.

552
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:04,335
First three vehicles mount up,
we're moving back to base.

553
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:06,938
Move out!

554
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,785
How are things going?
Things okay there, Struecker?

555
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:29,127
I don't want to talk about it now, Colonel!

556
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:30,564
I'm busy.

557
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,754
Sergeant Pilla's hit!

558
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,732
Christ, he's fucked up!

559
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,265
Is anyone hit?

560
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,169
Struecker, talk to me!

561
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:08,932
It's Sergeant Pilla!

562
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:10,930
What's his status?

563
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,307
What's his status?

564
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,241
He's dead.

565
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:17,576
He's dead.

566
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:19,238
Pilla's dead, sir.

567
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:26,522
C-2, this is McKnight.
We have a KIA Dominick Pilla. Over.

568
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,514
Roger that.

569
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,183
Get on that 50!

570
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,623
Someone get on that 50!

571
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,263
It's mine.

572
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,843
Three guys with RPGs,
coming up on your side now!

573
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,454
Stay with it!

574
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,120
This is 61. I'm hit. I'm hit.

575
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:42,094
Super 61 is hit. He is hit.
Wolcott's bird is hit.

576
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,927
You want to pull those PCLs off-line
or what?

577
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,434
Right, babe.

578
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,428
Come on.

579
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,778
61, going down.

580
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,211
61 going down.

581
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,717
61 is going down.

582
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:06,486
Super 61 is going down.

583
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:08,991
Super 61 is going down.

584
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:12,059
61 is going down.
I repeat, it's going down.

585
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:14,026
61's going down.

586
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:17,923
Hold on!

587
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:43,424
We got a Black Hawk down.
We got a Black Hawk down.

588
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:47,924
Super 61 is down.
We got a bird down in the city.

589
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:50,099
Super 61 is on the deck now.

590
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,695
Get an MH-six on site. Check for survivors.

591
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,768
Send in the SAR bird.

592
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:59,738
I want ground forces to move and secure
a new perimeter around that crash site.

593
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,868
Can you guide the convoy in there?

594
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,071
Roger that.

595
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:04,477
Well, move quick.

596
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:08,050
The whole city
will be coming down on top of them.

597
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:12,719
Star 41, come inbound
and see if you can land at the crash site.

598
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,255
Roger that. Star 41 inbound.

599
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,067
We just lost the initiative.

600
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:37,278
25, this is 64. Over.

601
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,279
25. Over.

602
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:43,181
25, Chalk Four is closest to the crash site.
Over.

603
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,911
64, I can't see the crash site. Over.

604
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:49,418
25, it's due east of you. You will find it.

605
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:53,393
Leave a security element in place.
Take the rest of your chalk to the crash.

606
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:56,830
Check for survivors. Secure the area.
All other chalks will follow.

607
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,529
25, do you read me? Over.

608
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,537
Galentine! Schmid!

609
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:05,800
Get Yurek.

610
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:07,304
Get Twombly.

611
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,875
Hey, there's a Black Hawk down.

612
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:11,843
Twombly, Nelson, stay here.

613
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:14,883
Hold this corner
and then exfil with the humvees.

614
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,919
Galentine, Schmid, you're coming with me.
Let's go.

615
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,515
How come I got to stay back here?

616
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,387
Because you're dependable.

617
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:25,823
All right...

618
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:28,861
...Iet's go!

619
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,004
I hate being dependable, man.

620
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,980
Juliet 25, hostiles advancing,
parallel west to your position.

621
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,354
Women and children among them. Over.

622
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,687
Hit the wall.

623
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,710
Incoming!

624
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:22,817
Grenade!

625
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:40,096
Go.

626
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,941
We still got guys inside!

627
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:54,741
I'll go to the crash.

628
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:58,751
You take the rest of the team.
I'll finish loading the prisoners.

629
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,254
No! We'll go to the crash site together.

630
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:03,554
Secure the perimeter,
wait for the humvees.

631
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,457
-Roger that.
-Follow my lead.

632
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,122
Sarg'nt, are you receiving me?

633
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,860
Yeah, I heard you.
We should be leaving soon.

634
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:15,534
All right, we need to move out now!

635
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:18,836
I'll finish loading the prisoners
and pick you up at the crash site!

636
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:20,136
Let's move out!

637
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,609
Moving out! Go!

638
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,720
Get in! Get in!

639
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,182
Move!

640
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:47,159
Eight o'clock!

641
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:03,449
Grimes, stay away from the walls.

642
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,700
Grimes. You okay?

643
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:22,299
Yeah!

644
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:25,739
Let's go, Maddox.

645
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:28,541
-C-2, convoy's moving out.
-Roger that.

646
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,339
Maddox, look at these jerks! These idiots!

647
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:34,141
Go, go! Right, Maddox, right!

648
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:46,217
Twombly, the convoy is leaving!

649
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:48,393
Hey, Twombly!

650
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,221
What?

651
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:52,924
-I think they've forgotten us.
-What?

652
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,626
It doesn't matter.

653
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:07,112
63 confirm. Skinnies are moving in
on all sides. They need help now.

654
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:12,184
Indigenous personnel
advancing to Wolcott crash site.

655
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:14,852
Say again. Over.

656
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:17,222
A lot of people closing in.

657
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:22,123
How far is Chalk Four from the crash site?

658
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:25,459
-Six blocks, sir.
-They need to haul ass.

659
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,190
Get down! Get down!

660
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:23,987
Scotty, are you okay?

661
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:27,496
No, don't go back!

662
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,265
Get down! Get down!

663
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:42,975
Technicals!

664
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,803
Got them!

665
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:53,818
Six o'clock! Move, move!

666
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:17,836
Go, go, go!

667
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:24,613
Go, go!

668
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,424
Come on!

669
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,629
Yurek, leaving!

670
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:43,765
Come on!

671
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:14,856
Uniform 64, left turn. Left turn.

672
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:19,425
Romeo 64, I need to know before I get to
the goddamn street!

673
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:22,229
You have to slow down. There's a delay.

674
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:27,034
From the time directions are relayed
from surveillance to JOC, then to me.

675
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:30,143
We can't slow down!
We're taking heavy enemy fire!

676
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:32,008
We can't slow down!

677
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:35,949
Danny, I'm getting information
from Orion surveillance above.

678
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:38,882
So get me my fucking directions to
the crash site!

679
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:42,982
Danny, hold on. I no longer have
the best view of your route.

680
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,750
Get your ass in the right place,
goddamn it!

681
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:49,227
What in the hell is the status
of Struecker's humvees?

682
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:52,267
Colonel Harrell, ETA to base,
Struecker's column.

683
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,097
ETA to base momentarily.

684
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,377
Open the gate!

685
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,728
-Get him out! Let's go! Let's go!
-Come on.

686
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:31,839
Watch his head.

687
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:33,273
Easy.

688
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:43,948
-Blackburn, can you hear me?
-Get him to a medic.

689
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:21,981
Star 41 is at the crash site
to evacuate the injured. Over.

690
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:23,150
Roger that.

691
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:03,863
I got you.

692
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:05,627
Easy.

693
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:14,707
Galentine, you all right?

694
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:18,610
Galentine, Kurth, with me!
Cover fire, now.

695
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:20,308
Full cover!

696
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:36,128
How many are in there?

697
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:38,962
Two pilots are dead,
two crew chiefs are wounded!

698
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:42,660
-He's hurt bad. We must get out of here.
-All right. Go ahead.

699
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:18,701
26, this is 25.
Is that you shooting up the technicals?

700
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,367
This is 26. Roger that.

701
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:25,540
DiTomasso, take the southeast corner.
We're setting up a perimeter. Over.

702
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:28,443
This is 26. Roger that. Moving there now.

703
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,948
Move out!

704
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,088
Captain Steele, come in.

705
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:38,657
Go ahead, 25. This is 64.

706
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:43,658
We got two wounded and we got both
the pilots dead in the chopper!

707
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:45,625
We need a medivac now!

708
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:51,438
It's too hot to land a bird.
You must secure the perimeter first. Over.

709
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:53,435
Where are the humvees?

710
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:56,478
Be advised, 25, the convoy will be there.

711
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:59,673
They're encountering a lot of resistance.
64 out.

712
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:15,458
-Get the 50 up!
-You should see the crash directly ahead.

713
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:18,132
All I see is a roadblock!

714
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:21,702
I'll have to figure out another way.

715
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:50,193
Give me a defensive perimeter
so we can load the wounded.

716
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:12,047
Fire your weapon, Othic!

717
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,263
Tell my girls I'll be okay.

718
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,170
Medic!

719
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,108
Hoo-ah!

720
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:10,902
Medic! Medic!

721
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:15,610
Joyce! Joyce!
Come on, help me pick him up!

722
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:21,420
Get us off this fucking street!
Where's the crash site? Say again.

723
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:24,753
Keep going straight 200 meters.

724
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,086
Roger that.

725
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:28,960
Let's go!

726
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,489
Let's go, goddamn it, let's go!

727
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:52,310
Hey, Twombles. Come here.

728
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,823
The humvees ain't coming back, dude.

729
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:00,553
What?

730
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:03,864
Were we supposed to go to them?

731
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:06,026
I thought they were coming to us.

732
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:10,829
-I think we're supposed to go to them.
-Shit.

733
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:15,734
Let's go to the crash site.

734
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:16,800
Okay.

735
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:20,415
Don't fire that thing so close to my head.
I can barely hear as it is.

736
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:21,471
Move out.

737
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,190
Shit! Get down!

738
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:41,826
What did I just tell you?
If you do that again--

739
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:48,200
You okay? Nelson.

740
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:51,176
You all right?

741
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:54,842
Search and rescue bird on station
inserting medics.

742
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:07,651
Go!

743
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:13,624
Go, go!

744
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:19,463
Son of a bitch. C-2, this is 68.
We've been hit.

745
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:22,975
Super 68, there is smoke coming
from the top of your rotor.

746
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:25,305
-Advise you to come out now.
-Roger.

747
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:27,213
Dropping last man.

748
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:34,050
Art, I've got skinnies with RPGs at 12:00.
Can you see them?

749
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:36,484
Got them. Give me 90 degrees left.

750
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:47,830
68 coming out.

751
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:52,204
Super 68 is out. Over.

752
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:04,677
Hey, Wilkie, what's the situation in there?

753
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:06,784
Both pilots are dead.

754
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:10,717
25, we can't move these guys, Matty.

755
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,724
We'll kill them just carrying them.

756
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:15,195
-Stabilize in here?
-Roger.

757
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:18,692
Stabilize in the bird.
Repeat: Stabilize in here. Over.

758
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,894
Understood, Wilkie.
We got you covered. Over.

759
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:24,461
Super 64, come inbound
and take Wolcott's position.

760
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:27,739
Roger. 64 is inbound.

761
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,495
Super 64, you all right?

762
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:59,370
This is Super 64. We're good.

763
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:02,442
You sure?
You look like you got clipped pretty good.

764
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:04,635
Instrument panels are okay.

765
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:08,781
No, we're good. Got a slight vibration
in the pedals, but we're good.

766
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:13,987
All right, put her down on the airfield, 64.
Have it checked out just to be safe.

767
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:15,445
Roger.

768
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:22,291
I'm getting movement in these pedals.
Check the systems again.

769
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:39,970
We lost the tail rotor! It's gone!

770
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:41,844
64 is going down!

771
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:44,509
64 is going in hard.

772
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:48,084
64 going down.

773
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:54,860
We're going down.

774
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:01,735
Get Struecker's column back out there.

775
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:04,102
They need to get to
Durant's crash site fast.

776
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,801
-Another bird down.
-I want them out of there.

777
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:08,476
All of them.

778
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:15,943
Captain Steele, we got to move
or we'll get pinned down!

779
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:18,209
We're moving as fast as we can.

780
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,483
You let me do my job and you do yours.
Over.

781
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,623
-Fuck! Fuck!
-Ruiz stay down.

782
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:33,861
-I fucking knew--
-Medic.

783
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:37,702
Fuck this! Captain Steele,
I'll take out the threat in the window.

784
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,237
We'll rally at the gray building.
Coming through.

785
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:40,832
Sarg'nt!

786
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:42,236
All right, let's move!

787
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:49,380
Cover me!

788
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:57,886
-Let's go, let's move!
-Moving out.

789
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:04,122
Friendly!

790
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,928
Friendlies coming through!

791
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:08,367
Let's go, let's go! Move up!

792
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:10,504
Come on, come on!

793
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,030
Come on!

794
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,410
Move up! Go! Move up!

795
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:23,546
What the fuck are you doing out there?

796
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:26,315
Doing my job!
We got to get to that crash site!

797
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:29,453
We got to get on that street,
and we got to move!

798
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:31,985
And you have got to keep up, sir!

799
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,321
Don't you ever give me orders, Sergeant.

800
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:36,864
We are combat ineffective, understand?

801
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:38,990
We got too many wounded to move!

802
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:42,298
Then give me some shooters
and I'll circle us to the bird.

803
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:47,498
Grimes! You're with Chalk Four?

804
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:48,700
Yes, sir!

805
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:52,347
All right, hook up with Delta!
Rejoin with Sergeant Eversmann.

806
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:55,179
The rest of you, secure this position!

807
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,614
Treat the wounded,
we'll wait for the convoy!

808
01:15:57,686 --> 01:16:00,211
Then we'll rally at the crash site. Roger!

809
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:01,787
My guys, let's go!

810
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:35,713
C-2, I have two Delta snipers,
Shughart and Gordon...

811
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:38,487
...volunteering to secure crash site two.
Over.

812
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:43,291
No, Super 62, negative that request.
Can't risk another bird.

813
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:49,069
We don't see anything moving down there,
we don't even know if anyone's alive.

814
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:53,069
A ground team is being organized
to go in now.

815
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:54,970
ETA on ground team? Over.

816
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:58,237
Unknown, not long.

817
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:00,745
Do what you can from the air.

818
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:06,516
All right, gather around!

819
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:09,886
Durant's 64 is down.
We're going back in to get him!

820
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,085
That's crazy. Is there anyone alive?

821
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,560
Doesn't matter, no one gets left behind.

822
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:16,991
We're wasting time here.

823
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:20,191
Refit and max out ammo and grenades,
you got five!

824
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:23,267
Sizemore, where are you going?

825
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:26,171
-With you guys.
-Not with that cast on you're not.

826
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:30,341
All right, all right, all right.
Go get your k-pot.

827
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:33,808
Talk to me.

828
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:35,481
I can't go back out there.

829
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:40,112
Thomas, everyone feels
the same way you do. All right?

830
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:43,519
It's what you do right now
that makes a difference.

831
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:46,049
It's your call.

832
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:47,553
Hoo-ah?

833
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:54,963
Hoo-ah.

834
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:14,948
It'll probably help to wash
the blood out of the humvees.

835
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:25,866
Sergeant Struecker!

836
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:29,868
Sergeant Struecker! Can I go, Sarge?

837
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:32,205
-You got some ammo?
-Roger, Sarge!

838
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,966
Hop in!

839
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:53,358
Wait!

840
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:56,457
Let's go, Thomas. Get in!

841
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:21,415
Which way?

842
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:29,420
-That way, I think!
-Not so fucking loud.

843
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:04,529
Nice donkey.

844
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:24,550
Rangers?

845
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:26,042
Who?

846
01:20:26,888 --> 01:20:30,449
It's Yurek! You fucking assholes!

847
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,024
Fuck!

848
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:34,787
Dude, we almost fucking killed you!

849
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:38,124
-Come to us!
-Fuck you, come to me.

850
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:51,910
Sorry, Sarge!

851
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,014
Dude, where the fuck have you been?

852
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:55,947
Never mind, you brought NOD, right?

853
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:58,349
No, I didn't and you want to know why?

854
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:01,787
Because you said: "You won't need that,
we'll be back in a half-hour."

855
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,415
Well, I wasn't saying it to you.

856
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:05,482
Nelson, cover this way.

857
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,453
We'll need night vision.

858
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:09,929
What's the matter with you?

859
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:13,062
Oh, he's deaf. It's my fault.

860
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,632
-We need to get out of here!
-That way.

861
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:19,367
We can't be far from the crash.
Which way?

862
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:21,770
I thought you might know.

863
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:23,943
Let's move out.

864
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:32,077
Nelson, Twombly? Come in. Over.

865
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:37,352
Nelson, Twombly, this is Galentine.
We need a position of the convoy. Over.

866
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,657
I can't raise them, Sergeant.

867
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,558
Sir, let's get the fuck out of here and evac!

868
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:48,093
-Let's move out.
-Back to the stronghold!

869
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:49,325
Come on!

870
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:54,837
Ground forces have occupied
several buildings along Marehan Road...

871
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,605
...but they're all spread out.

872
01:21:56,678 --> 01:22:01,115
Eversmann's Chalk Four has set up
a perimeter around Wolcott's crash site.

873
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:03,681
DiTomasso is in the adjacent structure.

874
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:07,988
Captain Steele and about 40 men, Rangers,
are here, a couple blocks away.

875
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:09,580
They're banged up pretty bad.

876
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:14,527
He set up a casualty collection point,
I don't think they'll be able to move.

877
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,254
Sergeant Sanderson
and a small Delta team...

878
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:21,200
...are moving from Steele's position
to the crash site as we speak.

879
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:33,373
Draw off fire!

880
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:36,508
When this asshole stops to reload,
cover me!

881
01:22:36,718 --> 01:22:38,151
-Go!
-Sir.

882
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:42,623
Again!

883
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:49,196
Loading!

884
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:53,056
Keep going!

885
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:55,531
I'm jammed!

886
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:58,172
I got it!

887
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:01,170
No, shit!

888
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:15,017
RPG!

889
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:32,531
You all right? You okay?

890
01:23:32,707 --> 01:23:35,676
Yeah. I can hear bells ringing.

891
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:39,508
Come on! Come on!

892
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:42,238
Go!

893
01:23:49,457 --> 01:23:52,426
A crowd is advancing six,
seven blocks from the crash.

894
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:54,825
Shughart and Gordon
again request permission...

895
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:58,332
...to secure until convoy arrives. Over.

896
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:01,593
General, crowds are in the hundreds now.

897
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:05,294
From where they are,
they can see things clearer than any of us.

898
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,307
They know what they're asking.

899
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:08,976
Let me talk to them.

900
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:10,269
This is Garrison.

901
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:14,611
I want to make sure that you understand
what you're asking, so say it out loud.

902
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:20,677
We're asking to go in and set up
a perimeter until ground support arrives.

903
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:25,186
You realize that I cannot tell you
when that might be, it could take a while.

904
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:28,619
-Roger that.
-You still want to go in there?

905
01:24:28,963 --> 01:24:29,759
Yes, sir.

906
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:35,395
-Colonel Harrell?
-Yes, General?

907
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:36,528
It's your call.

908
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:39,195
Roger that.

909
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:43,170
Goffena, put them in.

910
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:58,855
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

911
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:05,021
RPG!

912
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:16,501
Set up your perimeter!

913
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,943
There's a fucking rocket in him, sir!

914
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:29,888
Othic, calm down, goddamn it!
There's live ordnance, now get out!

915
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:33,023
Son of a bitch.

916
01:25:34,529 --> 01:25:37,692
All right, lift him up!
Lift him up! Easy, easy!

917
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:41,093
All right, get him in there! Good, good!
Easy, easy!

918
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:43,827
Get in that truck and drive.

919
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:45,964
-But I'm shot, Colonel.
-Everybody's shot.

920
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,133
We need the prisoners! Let's go!

921
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:52,702
Surveillance says to take Hawlwadig,
then go straight.

922
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:57,213
McKnight, we need you to turn around
and head back to Hawlwadig.

923
01:25:57,385 --> 01:25:59,649
You're shitting me!
We just came through there!

924
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:01,484
There must be a better route!

925
01:26:01,556 --> 01:26:06,721
That's the info I'm getting from JOC,
you need to turn around and head back.

926
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:10,021
Roger that. Roger that.

927
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:13,365
I cannot believe this shit!
Turn us around, Maddox.

928
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:15,402
They're trying to get us fucking killed!

929
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:17,062
Just get it over with! Drive!

930
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:18,127
Goddamn!

931
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:20,738
Get us out of here, goddamn it, drive!

932
01:26:28,449 --> 01:26:29,882
Keep your foot on the gas!

933
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:32,181
Keep your foot on the gas!

934
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:44,756
Fuck!

935
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:48,691
Shit.

936
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:06,916
C-2, Shughart and Gordon
are on the deck. Over.

937
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:08,088
Roger.

938
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:35,740
Friendlies!

939
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,147
God, it's good to see you!

940
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:41,188
It's good to see you. How bad?

941
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:44,157
My leg's broken
and my back feels kind of weird.

942
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:46,385
We've got to get you out of here.

943
01:27:47,362 --> 01:27:49,193
I'm pulling him out! Cover!

944
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:53,589
Wait, l--

945
01:28:02,143 --> 01:28:03,405
I'm putting you down.

946
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:06,580
C-2, we're at the 64 crash site,
securing perimeter.

947
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:08,240
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm good.

948
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:09,749
You're locked and loaded.

949
01:28:09,817 --> 01:28:13,548
Any skinnies come around these corners,
you watch our backs.

950
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:16,283
-Where's the rescue squad?
-We're it.

951
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:25,090
All right, stop, stop, Maddox. Stop.

952
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,567
Son of a bitch.

953
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:30,536
Romeo 64, we're back where we started.

954
01:28:30,772 --> 01:28:33,468
I'm low on ammo,
I got many wounded including me...

955
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:35,509
...vehicles that are barely running.

956
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:38,511
Okay, Danny,
I need a no-b.s. assessment here.

957
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:41,073
Can you get to the crash site?

958
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:44,410
Colonel, I can't see shit.

959
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:49,387
Negative.

960
01:28:49,457 --> 01:28:52,517
With the amount of wounded we have,
we'd do more harm than good.

961
01:28:52,593 --> 01:28:56,552
We need to come back to base, rearm
and regroup and then we can go back out.

962
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:57,620
Roger.

963
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:02,732
C-2, bring them back.
Get them out of there.

964
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:05,797
Roger. Return to base.

965
01:29:06,607 --> 01:29:07,972
We're going home!

966
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:10,167
Let's go. Left.

967
01:29:23,091 --> 01:29:26,390
Roger that. Understand.
Convoy returning to base.

968
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:33,759
-What's up?
-They're sending them back.

969
01:29:33,835 --> 01:29:35,496
The convoy's headed back to base camp.

970
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:37,731
Oh, now that makes sense, don't it?

971
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:42,266
We need to exfil the wounded now
and get out of here before it's too late!

972
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:46,171
If Colonel McKnight went back to base,
then he had a good reason.

973
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:47,814
It changes nothing.

974
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:49,414
All right, listen up.

975
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:53,477
We're going to hold the perimeter
and we're going to hold the strongpoint.

976
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:57,520
Conserve your ammo.
Only shoot at what you can hit.

977
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:01,124
The convoy is going to come.

978
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:03,519
We're going to get home.

979
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:16,999
Loading!

980
01:30:25,486 --> 01:30:26,817
Loading!

981
01:30:27,355 --> 01:30:29,152
Randy, I need a pistol mag!

982
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:43,526
Loading!

983
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:48,674
Randy, last mag!

984
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:53,204
Gordy!

985
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:57,940
Fuck!

986
01:31:11,432 --> 01:31:13,627
Gordy is gone, man. I'll be outside.

987
01:31:14,202 --> 01:31:15,328
Good luck.

988
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:39,624
We need the 10th Mountain in there.
Everything they got.

989
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:42,822
Pakistanis, Malays,
I want their tanks and APCs.

990
01:31:43,464 --> 01:31:44,863
They don't know we've gone in.

991
01:31:44,932 --> 01:31:49,369
We have stirred up a hornet's nest here.
We're fighting the entire city.

992
01:31:49,871 --> 01:31:54,535
I want every vehicle possible that's got
4 wheels and armor. Get everything.

993
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:58,041
Once they've assembled, we'll move
our men out of the hostile area...

994
01:31:58,112 --> 01:32:00,706
...and back to the Pakistani Stadium,
the safe zone.

995
01:32:00,781 --> 01:32:03,306
-Now, let's go.
-Roger that.

996
01:34:17,952 --> 01:34:19,681
Mohamed Farrah Aidid...

997
01:34:20,688 --> 01:34:22,280
claims this prisoner...

998
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:24,451
...alive!

999
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:42,802
On your knees! Get down! Get down!

1000
01:34:47,448 --> 01:34:51,384
Stay with me.
You just got a bullet in the leg.

1001
01:34:55,923 --> 01:34:58,858
See where those tires are burning?
All that black smoke?

1002
01:34:58,926 --> 01:35:02,453
Roger. I can see it,
but I can't get there. Over.

1003
01:35:02,663 --> 01:35:05,723
Go 100 meters past it. That's the crash.

1004
01:35:05,966 --> 01:35:08,059
Negative. You don't understand.

1005
01:35:08,235 --> 01:35:12,763
It's roadblock after roadblock.
You have to find us another route. Over.

1006
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:17,036
There ain't one. The only other route is
all the way around the city.

1007
01:35:17,111 --> 01:35:18,203
Roger that.

1008
01:35:18,279 --> 01:35:20,770
Kilo 64, this is Kilo 11.

1009
01:35:21,015 --> 01:35:25,475
Request permission to move
to crash site number two on foot. Over.

1010
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:28,412
Green light, Kilo 11.

1011
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:30,889
Stop the vehicle. Let me out.

1012
01:36:15,970 --> 01:36:19,565
After I'm finished with this,
I'll whip you boys up some margaritas.

1013
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:22,507
The usual. Blended, no salt.

1014
01:36:29,717 --> 01:36:32,914
This is Kilo 12.
We've got to change our position. Over.

1015
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,429
Eversmann, come in.

1016
01:36:48,669 --> 01:36:49,761
Eversmann.

1017
01:36:52,206 --> 01:36:54,538
-Roger who is this?
-Sanderson.

1018
01:36:54,608 --> 01:36:59,045
Do not-- I say again, do not fire to the
east. We are coming to you.

1019
01:37:00,514 --> 01:37:01,640
Understood.

1020
01:37:01,916 --> 01:37:04,350
DiTomasso and his men
are on the southeast corner.

1021
01:37:04,418 --> 01:37:06,784
We need you on the northeast building.

1022
01:37:06,854 --> 01:37:08,321
Roger. We'll take it.

1023
01:37:08,923 --> 01:37:11,153
Watch out for skinnies.
They're on the rooftops.

1024
01:37:11,225 --> 01:37:13,716
They're in prayer but not for much longer.

1025
01:37:17,198 --> 01:37:18,995
Hold your fire to the east.

1026
01:37:41,088 --> 01:37:42,783
Eversmann? It's Yurek.

1027
01:37:43,157 --> 01:37:45,557
I got Nelson and Twombly with me.

1028
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:48,724
We got the chopper in sight.
Where are you?

1029
01:37:48,963 --> 01:37:52,091
We're on the southwest corner.
Where have you been? Are you okay?

1030
01:37:52,166 --> 01:37:53,030
Yeah.

1031
01:37:54,602 --> 01:37:56,729
Hold your fire. We're coming in.

1032
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:02,600
We got to go.

1033
01:38:02,676 --> 01:38:05,611
Shawn, listen!
Sergeant Yurek's going to run first.

1034
01:38:05,779 --> 01:38:09,738
When he gets across the street,
he'll turn around and cover you as you run.

1035
01:38:09,817 --> 01:38:13,947
Listen closely. When you get there,
you'll turn around and cover me, okay?

1036
01:38:15,589 --> 01:38:17,921
You won't just run
to Eversmann's position.

1037
01:38:17,992 --> 01:38:20,825
You're going to stop
and you are going to cover me.

1038
01:38:21,328 --> 01:38:23,489
It's important you understand that.

1039
01:38:23,964 --> 01:38:25,329
Okay, you ready?

1040
01:38:26,133 --> 01:38:27,498
Yeah, I guess.

1041
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:34,631
-Don't forget.
-What?

1042
01:38:35,309 --> 01:38:36,537
Don't forget.

1043
01:38:50,057 --> 01:38:53,424
I got them in my sight, Sarg'nt.
They're coming up on the west gate.

1044
01:38:53,494 --> 01:38:54,620
I see them.

1045
01:38:57,564 --> 01:38:58,861
Let's move out.

1046
01:39:01,302 --> 01:39:03,031
Can you cover us, Sergeant?

1047
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:04,601
We got you.

1048
01:39:11,845 --> 01:39:13,244
Nelson!

1049
01:39:20,054 --> 01:39:21,043
Fuck!

1050
01:39:29,563 --> 01:39:30,552
Twombly!

1051
01:39:32,366 --> 01:39:33,492
Smith! No!

1052
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:34,896
You all right?

1053
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:39,603
Get it off of me!

1054
01:39:40,374 --> 01:39:41,773
Get it off!

1055
01:39:43,077 --> 01:39:44,704
Come on, man. Come on.

1056
01:39:45,879 --> 01:39:48,814
Doc! Need some help with Smith here!

1057
01:39:57,224 --> 01:39:58,521
My leg! My leg!

1058
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:00,287
Come on, Jamie, I got you!

1059
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:09,393
Up, one, two, three.

1060
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:13,400
-You're all right.
-I need some pressure on this wound.

1061
01:40:13,474 --> 01:40:14,532
My right thigh!

1062
01:40:14,608 --> 01:40:16,303
Pressure, yeah.

1063
01:40:16,477 --> 01:40:18,809
-Are my balls okay?
-You still have your balls.

1064
01:40:18,879 --> 01:40:19,971
I need more men in here.

1065
01:40:20,047 --> 01:40:22,641
Twombly! Nelson!

1066
01:40:22,716 --> 01:40:25,776
-Put him down.
-Oh, man, that really....

1067
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:29,351
-lt really hurts!
-Direct pressure on that.

1068
01:40:29,423 --> 01:40:30,913
It's okay, it's okay.

1069
01:40:31,492 --> 01:40:33,858
-Let me see it!
-All right.

1070
01:40:34,328 --> 01:40:36,592
All right, let me get a look at that.

1071
01:40:36,997 --> 01:40:38,396
Oh, shit!

1072
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:39,827
Oh, fuck!

1073
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:42,434
-What the fuck was that?
-It's all right.

1074
01:40:42,503 --> 01:40:44,664
Hold that down. I need a medivac now.

1075
01:40:44,738 --> 01:40:46,137
Fuck. Galentine!

1076
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:47,329
It's all right.

1077
01:40:47,408 --> 01:40:49,205
Galentine! Get me Captain Steele!

1078
01:40:50,144 --> 01:40:53,170
-Sarg'nt Ruiz, how you doing?
-Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1079
01:40:53,247 --> 01:40:57,115
They're not going to come and get us.
They're not going to come for us.

1080
01:40:57,217 --> 01:41:00,277
I need you to suck it up, Sarg'nt.
I need you to focus.

1081
01:41:00,354 --> 01:41:02,754
-Can you do that?
-Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1082
01:41:02,823 --> 01:41:04,723
Now, can you hold your weapon?

1083
01:41:05,092 --> 01:41:06,081
Yes, sir.

1084
01:41:06,326 --> 01:41:10,319
Anybody comes through that door
gets two in the chest and one in the head.

1085
01:41:10,664 --> 01:41:14,100
-You understand?
-I'm still in the fight, sir.

1086
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:17,303
Captain Steele,
I need a medivac in here now!

1087
01:41:17,504 --> 01:41:19,995
-Corporal Smith has been hit!
-Hold on, 25.

1088
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:21,773
Still in the fight.

1089
01:41:21,842 --> 01:41:23,309
He's hurt pretty bad.

1090
01:41:23,377 --> 01:41:27,108
25, we got wounded too. You'll have to
maintain your situation, over.

1091
01:41:27,181 --> 01:41:29,741
If he doesn't get help in a half-hour,
he's in trouble!

1092
01:41:30,517 --> 01:41:32,610
C-2, this is 64.

1093
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:37,052
Requesting a medivac for a critically
wounded at Chalk Four's location. Over.

1094
01:41:37,124 --> 01:41:39,991
Command, Chalk Four
is requesting medivac.

1095
01:41:40,194 --> 01:41:42,526
Can't risk it. It's still too hot.

1096
01:41:42,996 --> 01:41:47,865
Captain, we cannot send in medivac
at this time. Sit tight. Over.

1097
01:41:48,202 --> 01:41:52,036
25, this is 64. Negative on the medivac.
It's not possible.

1098
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:56,005
JOC cannot risk another bird.
You'll just have to hold on.

1099
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:04,016
All right. I got him.

1100
01:42:04,084 --> 01:42:06,518
I want direct pressure on the wound.

1101
01:42:08,388 --> 01:42:10,185
It's going to be all right.

1102
01:42:49,263 --> 01:42:52,130
I think this is mine!

1103
01:42:54,768 --> 01:42:57,896
This is Kilo 11.
I'm at the Durant crash site.

1104
01:42:58,105 --> 01:42:59,504
Roger that.

1105
01:43:21,094 --> 01:43:22,857
Crash site two secured.

1106
01:43:23,096 --> 01:43:25,462
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.

1107
01:43:25,966 --> 01:43:26,830
Cribbs?

1108
01:43:28,835 --> 01:43:31,133
-They're still debating the route.
-How long?

1109
01:43:31,271 --> 01:43:32,898
At least a couple of hours.

1110
01:43:33,073 --> 01:43:34,734
We haven't got that long, Joe.

1111
01:43:34,808 --> 01:43:39,404
Pakistani General says, since
we didn't deign to inform him of the raid...

1112
01:43:39,613 --> 01:43:43,447
...it'll take some time to mobilize
the 10th Mountain and 100 vehicles.

1113
01:43:43,517 --> 01:43:45,508
You tell the general this:

1114
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:48,620
I understand,
but it is my duty to remind him...

1115
01:43:48,822 --> 01:43:52,883
...that my men are surrounded
by thousands of armed Somali militia.

1116
01:43:53,093 --> 01:43:58,360
It's imperative that we move them out
of the hostile area and into the safe zone.

1117
01:43:58,565 --> 01:44:00,089
I need his help now.

1118
01:44:01,101 --> 01:44:02,329
Yes, sir.

1119
01:44:07,441 --> 01:44:08,669
Durant.

1120
01:44:09,376 --> 01:44:11,844
Michael Durant.

1121
01:44:12,579 --> 01:44:13,568
Yes.

1122
01:44:14,047 --> 01:44:16,447
You are the Ranger who kills my people?

1123
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:20,051
I'm not a Ranger. I'm a pilot.

1124
01:44:23,991 --> 01:44:25,288
That's right.

1125
01:44:25,959 --> 01:44:28,951
None of you Americans smoke anymore.

1126
01:44:32,165 --> 01:44:36,795
You all live long, dull, uninteresting lives.

1127
01:44:38,672 --> 01:44:40,537
What do you want with me?

1128
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:43,104
You have taken hostages.

1129
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:45,703
We have you.

1130
01:44:45,912 --> 01:44:49,006
My government
will never negotiate for me.

1131
01:44:49,549 --> 01:44:54,111
Then perhaps you and I can negotiate, huh?

1132
01:44:55,589 --> 01:44:58,114
Soldier to soldier.

1133
01:45:04,064 --> 01:45:05,861
I'm not in charge.

1134
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:13,573
Course not. You have the power to kill,
but not negotiate.

1135
01:45:14,041 --> 01:45:16,942
In Somalia, killing is negotiation.

1136
01:45:18,512 --> 01:45:21,879
Do you really think
if you get General Aidid...

1137
01:45:22,082 --> 01:45:25,449
...we will simply put down our weapons...

1138
01:45:25,585 --> 01:45:28,577
...and adopt American democracy?

1139
01:45:29,022 --> 01:45:30,819
That the killing will stop?

1140
01:45:31,224 --> 01:45:35,285
We know this:
Without victory, there can be no peace.

1141
01:45:36,063 --> 01:45:38,497
There will always be killing, you see?

1142
01:45:38,965 --> 01:45:41,160
This is how things are in our world.

1143
01:45:54,014 --> 01:45:57,677
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1144
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:03,256
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1145
01:46:05,992 --> 01:46:08,859
You got to take over from me. Both hands.

1146
01:46:16,570 --> 01:46:19,801
It's the femoral artery, but I can't see it.

1147
01:46:20,006 --> 01:46:23,464
Which means that
it's retracted up into the pelvis.

1148
01:46:23,677 --> 01:46:27,977
I have to find it and clamp it.
It's the only way to stop the bleeding.

1149
01:46:28,181 --> 01:46:30,274
I got no more lVs.

1150
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:34,452
So, I'm going to need you to assist. Okay?

1151
01:46:34,588 --> 01:46:36,215
Yeah, yeah.

1152
01:46:37,157 --> 01:46:40,524
Now listen, Jamie.
I got to do something, it's going to hurt.

1153
01:46:41,795 --> 01:46:45,492
I got to cause you more pain,
but I have to do it to help you.

1154
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:47,223
All right, you understand?

1155
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:49,291
-Morphine.
-I can't.

1156
01:46:49,503 --> 01:46:52,097
It'll lower your heart rate too far.
I'm sorry.

1157
01:46:52,172 --> 01:46:54,470
Twombly, why don't you take his hands?

1158
01:46:58,979 --> 01:47:01,914
Hold the wound open,
keep pressure on the top of the leg.

1159
01:47:01,982 --> 01:47:04,177
Yurek, take the feet and a flashlight.

1160
01:47:04,584 --> 01:47:05,710
On my count.

1161
01:47:05,786 --> 01:47:07,777
All right, Jamie. All right.

1162
01:47:10,056 --> 01:47:12,217
One. Two.

1163
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:14,218
Three.

1164
01:47:21,935 --> 01:47:24,369
Wait, wait. Okay. I feel it.

1165
01:47:25,005 --> 01:47:26,370
I feel the pulse.

1166
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:29,272
I got it. I got it.

1167
01:47:29,342 --> 01:47:30,934
I got it, yeah. I got it.

1168
01:47:31,011 --> 01:47:32,603
-I got it.
-You got it?

1169
01:47:33,046 --> 01:47:34,035
Clamp?

1170
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:37,815
I got it clamped.

1171
01:47:37,951 --> 01:47:39,145
-Hold it.
-Got it.

1172
01:47:39,219 --> 01:47:40,481
Here, grab it.

1173
01:47:41,154 --> 01:47:42,883
-It's tearing.
-I got it.

1174
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:44,988
-Doc, it's going back in!
-Hold it!

1175
01:47:45,058 --> 01:47:46,286
It's tearing!

1176
01:47:46,626 --> 01:47:49,595
-Okay. Get out. Hold the wound.
-Okay, I'm holding.

1177
01:47:50,831 --> 01:47:52,128
Move your hand.

1178
01:48:03,343 --> 01:48:04,571
What?

1179
01:48:23,697 --> 01:48:24,686
Fix it?

1180
01:48:28,301 --> 01:48:30,735
Yeah, yeah. We got it.

1181
01:48:46,386 --> 01:48:48,183
What the hell are you doing?

1182
01:48:48,255 --> 01:48:52,658
It's all in the grind, Sarg'nt.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

1183
01:48:52,859 --> 01:48:55,521
Grimesy, you are squared away.

1184
01:49:11,845 --> 01:49:15,804
Sarg'nt, how would you
like a nice hot cup of Joe?

1185
01:49:17,617 --> 01:49:19,209
Gold Coast blend.

1186
01:49:19,419 --> 01:49:22,354
Sit down.
I want to take a look at that foot.

1187
01:49:22,956 --> 01:49:25,049
-No, it's not a problem.
-Come on.

1188
01:49:31,498 --> 01:49:34,592
-Where the hell did they find you?
-Behind a desk.

1189
01:49:36,102 --> 01:49:39,128
No, really. What, you think I'm kidding?

1190
01:49:42,809 --> 01:49:44,606
-ls anybody hit?
-We're good!

1191
01:49:49,983 --> 01:49:51,143
You all right?

1192
01:49:51,217 --> 01:49:52,206
Yeah!

1193
01:49:52,419 --> 01:49:53,886
Is everybody all right?

1194
01:49:53,954 --> 01:49:54,978
Yeah!

1195
01:50:09,002 --> 01:50:10,196
Incoming!

1196
01:50:23,383 --> 01:50:25,317
Keep firing...faster!

1197
01:51:15,769 --> 01:51:17,760
DiTomasso's hit! Pull him out!

1198
01:51:51,237 --> 01:51:52,966
Ranger here. This is Kilo 11.

1199
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:56,270
Chalk Four. We're at the southeast corner
of the crash. Who's this?

1200
01:51:56,342 --> 01:51:58,333
This is Hoot.
I'm coming with three friendlies.

1201
01:51:58,411 --> 01:52:00,072
I need cover fire. Over.

1202
01:52:00,146 --> 01:52:03,081
Roger, Kilo 11. Hold your fire!
Deltas coming in.

1203
01:52:03,149 --> 01:52:05,174
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1204
01:52:09,889 --> 01:52:14,519
Ground personnel will have to mark
target positions with infrared strobes.

1205
01:52:15,195 --> 01:52:18,961
Get little birds on strafing runs
and keep them going all night long.

1206
01:52:19,065 --> 01:52:21,329
If we don't hold back this city...

1207
01:52:22,035 --> 01:52:25,027
...we'll have a 100 caskets
to fill by morning.

1208
01:52:25,238 --> 01:52:26,466
Yes, sir.

1209
01:52:26,673 --> 01:52:29,437
Colonel Harrell,
ground personnel at crash site one...

1210
01:52:29,509 --> 01:52:34,003
...will have to mark the target
with infrared strobes to prep for air strike.

1211
01:52:39,285 --> 01:52:40,513
McKnight.

1212
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:48,186
Between the 10th Mountain and U.N.,
we got enough personnel, okay?

1213
01:52:49,529 --> 01:52:52,327
Danny, you guys do not have to
go back out again.

1214
01:53:12,485 --> 01:53:15,045
I can't die here, man.

1215
01:53:16,222 --> 01:53:20,318
You're not going to die, all right?
You're not going to die.

1216
01:53:21,227 --> 01:53:22,694
I'm sorry.

1217
01:53:22,896 --> 01:53:26,161
You don't have anything to be sorry for.

1218
01:53:26,332 --> 01:53:29,495
You saved Twombly. You did perfect.

1219
01:53:30,703 --> 01:53:32,170
You okay, Twombs?

1220
01:53:32,739 --> 01:53:34,570
Yeah, I'm okay, Jamie.

1221
01:53:35,909 --> 01:53:38,104
You did what you were trained to do.

1222
01:53:39,045 --> 01:53:40,910
You should be proud of that.

1223
01:53:44,017 --> 01:53:45,348
Be proud of that.

1224
01:53:46,186 --> 01:53:48,051
-Ev?
-Yeah.

1225
01:53:50,023 --> 01:53:51,354
Do me a favor.

1226
01:53:54,427 --> 01:53:59,364
You tell my parents
that I fought well today.

1227
01:54:06,806 --> 01:54:08,671
And that I fought hard.

1228
01:54:10,643 --> 01:54:13,111
You're going to tell them yourself, okay?

1229
01:54:13,179 --> 01:54:14,510
Do you hear me?

1230
01:54:16,316 --> 01:54:17,374
All right?

1231
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:22,647
-Are the humvees here?
-They're coming, Jamie.

1232
01:54:23,156 --> 01:54:24,987
They're coming.

1233
01:54:25,158 --> 01:54:27,422
You just got to hang in there a little bit.

1234
01:54:27,493 --> 01:54:29,984
-You hold on for just a little bit.
-I can.

1235
01:54:30,163 --> 01:54:31,323
I can.

1236
01:54:32,699 --> 01:54:34,166
It's nothing.

1237
01:54:35,401 --> 01:54:36,834
It's nothing.

1238
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:38,997
It's nothing.

1239
01:54:39,072 --> 01:54:41,404
-It's nothing.
-It's nothing.

1240
01:54:42,342 --> 01:54:43,502
Nothing.

1241
01:54:51,184 --> 01:54:52,173
Oh, shit.

1242
01:54:53,186 --> 01:54:54,517
Hold the wound.

1243
01:55:21,547 --> 01:55:22,844
Doc.

1244
01:55:25,718 --> 01:55:26,742
Doc.

1245
01:55:43,836 --> 01:55:45,167
It's okay.

1246
01:56:11,798 --> 01:56:13,265
What are you doing?

1247
01:56:16,636 --> 01:56:18,365
We need the ammo.

1248
01:56:26,646 --> 01:56:28,443
You did all you could here.

1249
01:56:28,982 --> 01:56:31,212
They should've sent a medivac.

1250
01:56:31,718 --> 01:56:35,381
Right now we'd be out there
defending another crashed chopper.

1251
01:56:35,655 --> 01:56:38,146
More men would get torn up.

1252
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:42,491
Maybe.

1253
01:56:42,996 --> 01:56:45,863
See, you're thinking. Don't.

1254
01:56:45,965 --> 01:56:48,991
Because, Sergeant, you can't control
who gets hit or who doesn't.

1255
01:56:49,068 --> 01:56:51,832
Who falls out of a chopper or why.

1256
01:56:52,038 --> 01:56:54,666
It ain't up to you. It's just war.

1257
01:56:56,676 --> 01:56:58,667
Yeah, well, Smith's still dead.

1258
01:57:00,346 --> 01:57:04,942
-This all happened because Blackburn fell.
-Should have, could have, don't matter.

1259
01:57:05,118 --> 01:57:08,884
You'll get plenty of time
to think about all that later. Believe me.

1260
01:57:12,658 --> 01:57:15,786
Sergeant, you got your men this far.

1261
01:57:16,629 --> 01:57:18,324
You did it right today.

1262
01:57:18,531 --> 01:57:21,989
You need to start thinking about
getting these men out of here.

1263
01:57:28,408 --> 01:57:30,308
Well, shall we?

1264
01:57:39,052 --> 01:57:42,146
I need four guys in this corner now!

1265
01:57:48,327 --> 01:57:49,919
RPG!

1266
01:57:53,833 --> 01:57:56,324
This is Barber 52 in position for gun run.

1267
01:57:56,402 --> 01:57:58,529
Jesus Christ. Look at that.

1268
01:57:59,238 --> 01:58:02,264
This is 25! I can see you.
You're right above me.

1269
01:58:02,442 --> 01:58:05,878
Eversmann, I can't tell who's who
down there. Too much activity.

1270
01:58:05,945 --> 01:58:08,436
I'll mark the target with a strobe! Over.

1271
01:58:08,681 --> 01:58:09,841
Roger that.

1272
01:58:21,627 --> 01:58:22,787
You see it?

1273
01:58:25,131 --> 01:58:26,723
Nah, I can't see shit.

1274
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:30,567
-I'm putting it on the roof.
-You're going to need help!

1275
01:58:30,636 --> 01:58:31,625
Cover me.

1276
01:58:32,839 --> 01:58:36,605
Okay, guys, we're going to lay down
some cover fire for him on three!

1277
01:58:36,809 --> 01:58:37,798
Ready?

1278
01:58:37,977 --> 01:58:38,966
One.

1279
01:58:39,045 --> 01:58:40,137
Two.

1280
01:58:40,313 --> 01:58:42,042
Three. Go!

1281
01:59:14,614 --> 01:59:18,050
I got your position. I got the target.
We're inbound and hot.

1282
01:59:42,642 --> 01:59:47,306
C-2, miniguns dry. Request permission
to return to base. Rearm. Over.

1283
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:50,313
Roger that. Second team inbound.
Your station.

1284
01:59:50,483 --> 01:59:52,678
On your location, four minutes.

1285
02:00:00,826 --> 02:00:03,886
All right, they're here.
Get the wounded ready to move.

1286
02:00:04,363 --> 02:00:06,797
Lay down some cover fire!

1287
02:00:09,135 --> 02:00:11,228
I thought I heard a noise out here!

1288
02:00:11,304 --> 02:00:14,034
-Load up. We're getting out of here.
-Yes, sir.

1289
02:00:17,210 --> 02:00:21,943
25, this is 64. The rescue column's here
and will be with you in about 5 minutes.

1290
02:00:22,148 --> 02:00:23,877
Prepare your men for exfil.

1291
02:00:23,950 --> 02:00:26,441
Yeah, roger that, sir! Roger that!

1292
02:00:27,186 --> 02:00:30,952
Five minutes! The convoy is going to be
here in five minutes!

1293
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:53,174
I need a mag! Eversmann, I'm out!

1294
02:00:53,346 --> 02:00:54,677
My last one!

1295
02:01:04,857 --> 02:01:07,018
The convoy is here!

1296
02:01:25,578 --> 02:01:29,105
Sergeant Eversmann.
I heard you guys needed a lift!

1297
02:01:29,348 --> 02:01:31,009
Yes, sir!

1298
02:01:31,217 --> 02:01:33,811
Bring your wounded
and start loading them up!

1299
02:01:41,027 --> 02:01:43,154
Hey, I got you. I got you.

1300
02:01:43,362 --> 02:01:46,092
It's okay. I want to walk.

1301
02:01:46,632 --> 02:01:49,692
Yeah, I would too. Let's go!

1302
02:01:58,878 --> 02:01:59,970
Move!

1303
02:02:03,249 --> 02:02:06,582
We get the pilots' bodies out,
and then we go to the stadium.

1304
02:02:07,253 --> 02:02:09,050
We're running out of room around here.

1305
02:02:09,121 --> 02:02:11,089
Cram into every possible space.

1306
02:02:11,924 --> 02:02:16,918
Okay, 10th Mountain provides security
for armor, walks us out of the hot zone.

1307
02:02:17,129 --> 02:02:18,619
10th Mountain? No.

1308
02:02:18,831 --> 02:02:21,925
Sir, with respect,
my Rangers can provide rear security.

1309
02:02:22,101 --> 02:02:26,265
We'll walk you out of the hot zone,
then we'll jump on the last few vehicles.

1310
02:02:27,273 --> 02:02:28,535
Okay, let's get out of here.

1311
02:02:28,607 --> 02:02:29,801
Let's go.

1312
02:02:30,009 --> 02:02:32,500
-All right, you got him?
-Yeah, come on.

1313
02:02:34,447 --> 02:02:35,812
Come on!

1314
02:02:36,949 --> 02:02:39,941
These things are fucking bullet magnets.
Come on, let's go!

1315
02:02:40,019 --> 02:02:42,453
We go when I'm ordered to, soldier.

1316
02:02:45,324 --> 02:02:46,518
Careful.

1317
02:02:47,126 --> 02:02:49,321
Easy. Go easy.

1318
02:02:52,732 --> 02:02:54,097
Easy.

1319
02:03:04,610 --> 02:03:06,840
Colonel, what is going on down there?

1320
02:03:06,912 --> 02:03:10,109
They're dismantling
the entire cockpit around the body.

1321
02:03:10,316 --> 02:03:13,979
How long is it going to take?
I need an honest, no-shit assessment.

1322
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:16,285
They can't say!

1323
02:03:18,257 --> 02:03:19,485
Danny...

1324
02:03:20,993 --> 02:03:22,790
...no one gets left behind.

1325
02:03:23,496 --> 02:03:25,327
You understand me, son?

1326
02:03:25,798 --> 02:03:27,265
Yes, General.

1327
02:03:27,933 --> 02:03:29,560
Do what you have to do.

1328
02:03:30,936 --> 02:03:32,198
Roger.

1329
02:03:38,844 --> 02:03:41,074
-Come on. Bring him through.
-I got him.

1330
02:03:41,947 --> 02:03:45,110
-Get all his gear. Get the wounded out.
-Got you, sir!

1331
02:03:50,723 --> 02:03:52,122
-Move!
-Got you!

1332
02:03:52,792 --> 02:03:54,817
Move out! Move out! Let's go!

1333
02:04:04,904 --> 02:04:05,893
Fuck!

1334
02:04:08,741 --> 02:04:10,072
Fire in the hole!

1335
02:04:10,276 --> 02:04:12,107
-Let's go! Move!
-Let's go!

1336
02:04:22,655 --> 02:04:26,056
-Open the hatch! We got men back here!
-No room here! Go on the roof!

1337
02:04:26,125 --> 02:04:27,217
What's going on?

1338
02:04:27,293 --> 02:04:30,285
-The roof?
-I'm not getting on no fucking roof!

1339
02:04:31,263 --> 02:04:32,662
No, no, it's full.

1340
02:04:34,099 --> 02:04:37,364
We're running out. Keep moving.
Use the vehicles as cover.

1341
02:04:39,772 --> 02:04:41,831
Move it! Let's go!

1342
02:04:58,757 --> 02:05:01,282
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

1343
02:05:03,295 --> 02:05:04,660
-Move!
-Go! Move!

1344
02:05:04,897 --> 02:05:06,262
Go!

1345
02:06:00,853 --> 02:06:03,287
Get down! Get down!

1346
02:06:04,523 --> 02:06:05,785
Get down, lady!

1347
02:06:08,294 --> 02:06:09,659
I'm out of ammo!

1348
02:06:11,030 --> 02:06:13,021
Sanderson, I'm out of ammo!

1349
02:06:18,037 --> 02:06:19,629
Don't you do it.

1350
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:22,730
-What are you doing?
-Don't you damn do it.

1351
02:06:24,543 --> 02:06:25,908
Kurth, let's go!

1352
02:08:49,755 --> 02:08:51,245
Easy.

1353
02:09:41,140 --> 02:09:42,903
Ah, shit.

1354
02:09:42,975 --> 02:09:46,638
Bullet missed your jugular by
about three millimeters. Don't move.

1355
02:09:48,313 --> 02:09:50,338
Hurry up, hurry up.

1356
02:09:53,719 --> 02:09:57,712
Little short on coffee,
but I got you some tea.

1357
02:10:01,994 --> 02:10:03,621
How you doing, soldier?

1358
02:10:04,830 --> 02:10:06,695
Can't feel a thing.

1359
02:10:16,775 --> 02:10:18,367
Take his pulse.

1360
02:10:51,710 --> 02:10:53,109
Hey, Sarg'nt.

1361
02:10:57,683 --> 02:10:58,672
Captain.

1362
02:10:58,851 --> 02:11:01,843
Lorenzo. How you doing?

1363
02:11:04,456 --> 02:11:09,291
It went in and out, so the medic said
I should be okay in a couple of days.

1364
02:11:09,461 --> 02:11:11,156
That's great news.

1365
02:11:11,763 --> 02:11:13,458
Are we going after them?

1366
02:11:13,565 --> 02:11:16,295
You bet your ass we will.
We got to regroup.

1367
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:19,804
Don't go out there without me.

1368
02:11:20,806 --> 02:11:24,298
Don't go back out there without me.

1369
02:11:25,043 --> 02:11:26,943
I can still do my job.

1370
02:11:28,714 --> 02:11:31,342
You get some rest now, okay?

1371
02:11:46,498 --> 02:11:47,897
You're going back in?

1372
02:11:50,002 --> 02:11:51,833
There are still men out there.

1373
02:11:54,239 --> 02:11:55,797
Goddamn.

1374
02:12:00,979 --> 02:12:02,276
When I go home...

1375
02:12:03,282 --> 02:12:04,772
...and people ask me:

1376
02:12:04,950 --> 02:12:08,283
"Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?

1377
02:12:08,854 --> 02:12:12,688
"Why? You some kind of war junkie?"

1378
02:12:13,492 --> 02:12:15,926
I won't say a goddamn word.

1379
02:12:16,261 --> 02:12:17,489
Why?

1380
02:12:18,130 --> 02:12:19,961
They won't understand.

1381
02:12:21,700 --> 02:12:23,998
They won't understand why we do it.

1382
02:12:25,504 --> 02:12:29,634
They won't understand
it's about the men next to you.

1383
02:12:31,476 --> 02:12:32,807
And that's it.

1384
02:12:34,980 --> 02:12:36,311
That's all it is.

1385
02:12:46,658 --> 02:12:51,027
Don't even think about it, all right?
I'm better on my own.

1386
02:12:56,168 --> 02:12:59,160
We started a whole new week.
It's Monday.

1387
02:13:12,017 --> 02:13:14,178
I was talking to Blackburn the other day...

1388
02:13:14,252 --> 02:13:18,951
...and he asked me, "What changed?
Why are we going home?"

1389
02:13:20,492 --> 02:13:22,824
And I said, "Nothing. "

1390
02:13:23,028 --> 02:13:26,964
But that's not true, you know.
I think everything's changed.

1391
02:13:28,367 --> 02:13:29,857
I know I've changed.

1392
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:38,336
A friend of mine asked me
before I got here....

1393
02:13:38,477 --> 02:13:40,741
It was when we were all shipping out.

1394
02:13:40,879 --> 02:13:42,369
He asked me:

1395
02:13:43,648 --> 02:13:46,378
"Why are you going to fight
somebody else's war?

1396
02:13:47,085 --> 02:13:49,519
"What, do y'all think you're heroes?"

1397
02:13:52,491 --> 02:13:54,891
I didn't know what to say at the time...

1398
02:13:57,829 --> 02:14:00,229
...but if he asked me again, I'd say no.

1399
02:14:02,801 --> 02:14:04,826
I'd say there's no way in hell.

1400
02:14:05,937 --> 02:14:07,962
Nobody asks to be a hero.

1401
02:14:13,311 --> 02:14:15,575
It just sometimes turns out that way.

1402
02:14:19,551 --> 02:14:22,611
I'll talk to your ma and pa
when I get home, okay?

1403
02:15:06,198 --> 02:15:09,895
My love, you are strong
and you will do well in life.

1404
02:15:10,936 --> 02:15:13,404
I love you and my children deeply.

1405
02:15:14,306 --> 02:15:17,798
Today and tomorrow,
let each day grow and grow.

1406
02:15:19,010 --> 02:15:23,174
Keep smiling and never give up,
even when things get you down.

1407
02:15:24,483 --> 02:15:26,917
So, in closing, my love...

1408
02:15:27,285 --> 02:15:31,119
...tonight, tuck my children in bed warmly.

1409
02:15:31,556 --> 02:15:36,152
Tell them I love them.
Then hug them for me...

1410
02:15:36,361 --> 02:15:39,194
...and give them both
a kiss good night for Daddy.
