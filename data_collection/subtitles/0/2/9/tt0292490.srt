1
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,960
I'll check him tomorrow

2
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,140
Mister Sinha, this is a case
of liver cirrhosis

3
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,680
The liver is badly damaged.
The patient is under observation

4
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,890
It's difficult to say anything yet

5
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,750
But, you can do something?

6
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,490
The problem is, we can't do a liver
transplant... on such short notice

7
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,200
If you wish to inform her
family or relatives...

8
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,540
...you may use my phone

9
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,670
Hey buddy, how are you?
Where are you?

10
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,670
I'm at the hospital

11
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,530
Hospital! Are you okay?

12
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,040
Ya, I'm OK

13
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,370
So, what's wrong then?

14
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,020
Just hang in there. I'm coming

15
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,380
By the way, Akash is back in Bombay.
I'll bring him along

16
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,930
He won't come

17
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,920
Don't be silly. Forget what happened

18
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,830
He'll be very happy to
know you're here.

19
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,120
Ya Sameer, tell me

20
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,030
Maybe you should go meet him alone.
I don't want to come.

21
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,250
You are right.
Let bygones be bygones...

22
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,220
But what's happening now
isn't wrong either, is it?

23
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,980
I am living my life and Sid his

24
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,790
I really think you should
go meet him alone

25
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,860
Sameer, come home quickly.
Now. At once

26
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,750
Sameer! Akash! What's wrong?
What's the rush?

27
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,010
How do you like it?

28
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,560
Have you gone mad?

29
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,320
On the phone you sounded like somebody's
broken into your house!

30
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,600
What do you mean beautiful!?

31
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,850
But Sid... don't you think
she resembles someone?

32
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:14,940
Resembles whom?

33
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,090
What do you think, Sameer?

34
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,050
I think everybody resembles
some one or the other.

35
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,080
But she resembles Miss. Kashyap

36
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,930
Our Economics teacher?

37
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,290
Yes, sir. Our Economics teacher

38
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:30,930
No man!

39
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,430
Ya man. I know Miss. Kashyap
better than you

40
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,160
Tuitions...

41
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,870
I used to go to her for tuitions

42
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,050
At these tuitions, were there other
students or just the two of you?

43
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,280
What do you think?
- Just the two of you?

44
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,150
You are right, Akash

45
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,050
She does resemble Miss. Kashyap.
But guess where I've messed up?

46
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,890
You've got her figure wrong

47
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,730
What do you know about her figure?

48
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,610
I'm looking for Sid

49
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,460
Sinha... Siddharth Sinha

50
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,110
When did you return to Bombay?
- This morning.

51
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,890
Can't imagine what 'd have
happened if I wasn't here

52
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,520
How is she now?

53
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,360
Don't know. It's hard to say

54
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,430
Tell me about you.
What're you up to these days?

55
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,370
I'm working with Dad in his
computer business

56
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,740
Everything else is the same...

57
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,850
And you? Still at your uncle's place
in Poona?

58
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,520
Ya. It's a very nice.
You must come there sometime

59
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:15,860
Definitely man

60
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,390
Are you just saying that or
do you really intend on coming?

61
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,430
I intend on doing a lot of things
...like getting married

62
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,050
I always knew that the first to ge
married among us three would be you

63
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,220
Guess what! So is Akash

64
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,230
What! Akash! Getting married!?
That's funny

65
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,190
I'm not kidding!

66
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,160
No way!

67
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,950
But to whom? That girl who was
crazy about him in college?

68
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,910
Don't you remember her?

69
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,940
She used to say Akash's name
in that peculiar way!

70
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,980
God! Deepa is coming here!

71
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:27,740
Akash, let's dance. It'll make the
other couples jealous

72
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,040
Sure! Why not! Go ahead.
I'll be right with you

73
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,380
In three lifetimes from now

74
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,400
Sameer, please get me a drink.
I'm ever so thirsty

75
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,940
And throw in a dance or two with
Deepa while you're at it

76
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,690
What're you sketching?

77
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,710
Priya, isn't Sameer taking too
long to get your drink?

78
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,970
Did somebody just die?
- Yes... you!

79
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,800
Did I send you to get a drink
or chat up other girls!

80
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,470
I'm sure you have something
going on with her

81
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:20,150
I remember you were never home
when I was away on holiday

82
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,920
You've got it all wrong, Priya

83
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,380
How do you know her?

84
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,150
Did somebody just die?

85
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,500
Who is she?
- I don't know

86
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,570
You must have seen her somewhere!

87
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,700
That I have.
- Where?

88
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,000
She's over there

89
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,260
Priya, do you know her?

90
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,460
Forget it man. She doesn't
seem your type

91
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,260
I don't plan on marrying her!
Big deal about my type

92
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,230
And may I know what your type is?

93
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,810
One who lives her life
and lets me live mine

94
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,010
Someone not overtly emotional

95
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,910
Oh, I remember.
You once met such a girl

96
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,350
The affair lasted for two weeks!

97
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,740
That itself was too much

98
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,550
Anyway, I'm off...

99
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,280
...or she'll have had grandchildren
by the time I get there

100
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,120
Think about it.
I don't see her biting the hook

101
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,030
It's called the good-ole
Akash charm and it never fails

102
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,500
Is the mike leaking., where has 3 gone?

103
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,750
Today, on this all important
graduation day...

104
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,050
I have decided to sing a song

105
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,340
And because we are stepping
into a new world...

106
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:25,670
...where the responsibility to be
somebody will be thrust on us...

107
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,640
The title of the song is:
"A hundred ways to get a job"

108
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,190
Relax guys! I was only kidding!

109
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,510
If people say... that we are crazy,
then let them

110
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,660
We don't give a damn
about what they think

111
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,570
When we can play music
When we can sing...

112
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,440
Then why should we hesitate?

113
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,350
We will sing the melody
that's in our hearts

114
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,580
If the world gets angry...
- Let it be angry

115
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,230
If the world quarrels...
- Let it quarrel

116
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,320
If the world fights...
- Just it fight.

117
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,090
Just keep right on singing

118
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,960
If the world sulks...
- Let it sulk

119
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,760
If ties are broken...
- Let them break

120
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,500
If someone leaves you...
- Let them go

121
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,370
Don't ever be afraid
We are today.

122
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,840
Why should our style be old?

123
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,810
There's lightning in our eyes.
A storm in our breath

124
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,240
What's fear, what's defeat?
We don't know what they mean

125
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:51,750
The earth and sky,
are created for us

126
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,630
I'm sure we could even
pluck the stars out of the night

127
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,400
Our abode is beyond the sky

128
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,740
We are today.
Why should our style be old?

129
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,550
We have been raised in the
land of dreams

130
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:57,050
We can be as shy as
we are openly affectionate

131
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:04,560
Mesmerising everybody
wherever we go...

132
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:11,730
...teaching you lovely women
the art of love

133
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:18,070
We know how to steal
a woman's heart and her sleep

134
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:25,750
We are today.
Why should our style be old?

135
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:33,490
If people say...
...that we are crazy, then let them

136
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:47,100
We don't give a damn
about what they think

137
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,370
When we can play music
When we can sing...

138
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,100
Then why should we hesitate?

139
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:09,720
We will sing the melody
that's in our hearts

140
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,560
If the world gets angry...
- Let it be angry

141
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,430
If the world quarrels...
- Let it quarrel

142
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,260
If the world fights...
- Let it fight

143
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,060
Just keep right on singing

144
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,070
If the world sulks...
- Let it sulk

145
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,740
If ties are broken...
- Let them break

146
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,500
If someone leaves you...
- Let them go

147
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,400
Don't ever be afraid

148
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:31,070
We are today.
Why should our style be old?

149
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,140
Shalini... that's a lovely name

150
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,550
I haven't seen you before.
You're not from our college

151
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,390
You're right. I'm here with somebody

152
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,400
And now would you say yes to
dancing with this somebody?

153
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,630
The fact is that Rohit...

154
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,360
Rohit! Okay!
So you are Rohit's sister?

155
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,060
No. Actually I...

156
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,010
Rohit and I are very good friends.
Why, he's more like a brother

157
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,420
Not even if I told you
that I love you?

158
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,530
Yes, Shalini. I love you
and only you

159
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,960
My every breath...

160
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,590
...every heartbeat...

161
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,060
...every moment,
is for you, Shalini

162
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,670
I'm sure that I was born
so that I could love you

163
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,100
And you were born to become mine

164
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,580
You are mine, Shalini

165
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,740
And if you ask your heart...

166
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,510
...you will know that I speak
the truth.

167
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,290
Who are you?

168
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,670
Don't you recognize your brother Rohit?

169
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,970
You are Rohit? I mean,
you too- are Rohit?

170
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,940
I thought Shalini was that
other Rohit's sister.

171
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,140
Look, he's over there

172
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,820
Sameer...! Your name is Sameer?

173
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:36,730
So you've being lying to me all along!
That's really wrong of you

174
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,370
What can I say now...
You can see for yourself

175
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,100
He got me to believe that
his name was Rohit

176
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,280
Neither is he Rohit
nor Shalini my sister

177
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,180
Shalini is my fiancee

178
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,310
Fiancee...!

179
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,190
I don't like you being friends
with Akash at all

180
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,330
His behaviour the other night...
You know how embarrassed I was?

181
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,830
Let him do what he wants.

182
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,230
Just keep away from him

183
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,710
But Akash is my friend, Priya!

184
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,770
Like you don't have
any other friends?

185
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,210
Yes, I do... But he...

186
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:24,180
Just decide, Sameer. You can
either be with Akash or me!

187
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,550
I am thinking...

188
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,050
You need time to think
if you want to be with me!

189
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,460
Okay. So you want some time?

190
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,230
No!

191
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,100
I'm going out with friends.
I'll be back by 2.00

192
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,340
If I don't hear from you before that,
I'll know what your answer is

193
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,280
Don't you think you are
over-reacting?

194
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,280
No

195
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:08,880
You've never seen me over-react.
If I do... then God help you!!

196
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,040
What are you doing!

197
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:37,480
Your bruise has turned a strange colour.
Have you seen it, Sid?

198
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,750
I'm glad you like it!
Do you want one?

199
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,890
Hey! Don't get that anger out on me man

200
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,990
Did I ask you to speak to Shalini?

201
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,260
No. But you could've at least helped me.
You just sat there!

202
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,370
Such a true friend! I think I'd be
better off befriending Rohit

203
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,740
I'd at least get some protection!

204
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,740
May God bless your unity. I'm off.

205
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,410
Where to? -Home.

206
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,650
Why? What's the hurry?
Right, Sameer?

207
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,080
Ya, man, chill. It's only
1'O' clock

208
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,850
In which country?
It's nearly 4 here!

209
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,810
I forgot to call Priya!

210
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,050
Why are you so scared of Priya?

211
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,410
I'm not scared of her

212
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,120
I don't want to hurt her
or lose her

213
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:47,190
Sameer, I can't understand
how you tolerate her

214
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,050
She seems more a boss
than a girlfriend!

215
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,200
Akash, I'm asking for help,
not your expert comments

216
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,030
What should I do?

217
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,060
What do you think?

218
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,530
I'll tell you what.
Call Priya and apologise

219
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,200
Tell her you will never meet
Akash again

220
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,740
You know I won't do that!

221
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,310
What if she gets hurt...
What if you lose her!

222
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,250
You'll never improve, will you

223
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,950
Why are you turning this
into such an issue?

224
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,220
Just call her, talk to her.
It'll all be okay

225
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:51,650
The thing is... but listen... You're not
...but I... what I'm saying...

226
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,350
I'm at Akash's

227
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:00,630
She hung up

228
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,490
What did you expect?

229
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,430
She'll say Sorry darling!

230
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,010
Enough is enough, Sameer.
Listen to me

231
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,470
Just go there and tell her
these tantrums won't work

232
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,080
If she wants to be with you,
she must follow your wishes

233
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,210
She's challenged your
self-respect, buddy

234
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,150
What are you doing? Be a man!

235
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,190
That's exactly what I'm going to do.
- That's the way to go!

236
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,310
He's dead!

237
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,040
Oh, Priya?
- Please give Sameer the phone

238
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,890
But Sameer hasn't come here. I too am
looking for him since last night

239
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,350
What? Didn't he come there?

240
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,420
Careful man!
Only this eye is working

241
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,770
We need to talk

242
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,440
There's no need for that. I know
what you have to say

243
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,310
You know? - Yes

244
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,220
I spoke to Akash after our talk

245
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:24,610
Right! And?

246
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,340
He said you weren't at his house

247
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,550
Stop pretending! I can't believe
I did this to myself

248
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,760
I never knew you were such a liar

249
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,290
I don't want to see your
face ever again!

250
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,990
Could I be of any assistance?

251
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,970
It's not a problem at all

252
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,040
Oh God! What's in here?
- My things

253
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,920
Hang on. I'll get it from this side

254
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:36,270
If just one suitcase has reduced
us to this condition, then...

255
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,210
There's only two more like this

256
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,580
Is that all? Just two more?
Let's go

257
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:05,870
It's a nice house

258
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,580
It belongs to the company I work for

259
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,520
I am an interior designer...
Tara Jaiswal

260
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:26,960
What do you do?

261
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,760
I work as a porter on Sundays

262
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,330
And the rest of the week?

263
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,870
Normally if anyone asks me that, I say
anything that pops into my head

264
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,110
But I'll tell you the truth because
I think it might be of interest to you

265
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,210
I don't quite understand?

266
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:48,110
I mean you have three paintings in your
luggage and that's my vocation

267
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,330
May I see your paintings?

268
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,320
Of course

269
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:00,360
Where do you live?

270
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,930
The last house down this road.
You can come whenever you wish

271
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,580
Sid, I'm going to the office.
- Just a minute, Ma

272
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:16,640
I'm coming along. Just drop me off
at Sameer's

273
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,620
By the way, it's Anju's wedding
anniversary today

274
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,710
She'll be very disappointed
if you don't come

275
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,300
Is Siddharth home? - Yes

276
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,700
You are...? - I am Tara

277
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,730
Ma, this is Tara

278
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,770
Well, I'd better be going

279
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,380
Ya, you go ahead, I'll go myself.

280
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,410
All right. But you are coming
this evening, aren't you?

281
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,210
Where? - To Anju's!

282
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,390
Mom, I get extremely bored there

283
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,960
There are very few places in this world
where you don't get bored

284
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,860
Fine! Have it your way.

285
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:12,800
Please have a seat

286
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,070
I'd like to see your paintings first

287
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,440
The same theme here too

288
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,620
What theme?

289
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,020
I have learnt something about
you today

290
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:11,260
Something I couldn't see
at our first meeting

291
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,190
What's that?

292
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,840
The thing is, you meet people,
talk to them, laugh...

293
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,730
But there's a world within you...

294
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,140
...full of dreams, of fantasies...

295
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,180
...that you don't share with anyone

296
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,180
I wonder if those, who claim
to know you...

297
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,250
...really know you at all

298
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,670
What makes you say that?

299
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,380
The door is not open...
Entry is forbidden...

300
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,380
The box is tightly bound...
No one can steal anything...

301
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,220
And who can tell what feelings reflect
behind those shut eyelids...

302
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,850
I wonder what other secrets your
paintings hide within them...

303
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,200
Or within you perhaps

304
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,170
Why are you looking at me
like that?

305
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,540
Anyway, which do you think
is your best?

306
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,970
I have yet to create that one

307
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,750
Look at your face!
White as a sheet!

308
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,900
Look, I am very angry right now
and all because of you

309
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,230
Hey! I saved your life and
you are angry with me?

310
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,190
Saved my life?
- Absolutely!

311
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,900
This was bound to happen

312
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,770
Priya would've left you tomorrow
if not today. Know why?

313
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,610
Because she didn't love you,
she loved some other Sameer

314
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,510
He looked like you but was
someone else

315
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,450
You are not that- Sameer. You are the
Sameer I know, Sid knows...

316
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,080
And Priya could only hope to know

317
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,960
If you became that Sameer, our this
Sameer would be defeated!

318
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,490
I never thought of it like that...
- I know

319
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,330
Then pack your bags and let's go

320
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,170
Sid and I are waiting for you
in the car

321
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,910
Where are we going? - Goa!

322
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,130
Goa...?!

323
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,880
The heart wants...

324
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,410
The heart wants...

325
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,660
May these sparkling days never end

326
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,170
The heart wants...

327
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,900
May we never have to be
without our friends

328
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:48,000
May our days be full of poetry...

329
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,490
...our evenings dance and
nights sing.

330
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,150
May our time together always
be fun and exciting

331
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:09,830
May every path we tread
bring us happiness

332
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,160
The heart wants...

333
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,940
May these sparkling days
never end

334
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,510
The heart wants...

335
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,010
May we never have to be
without our friends

336
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:34,130
Our paths dazzle with their glitter

337
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,530
May this joy and light
be ours by right

338
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,030
Where's Akash?

339
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,140
There... behind the plant

340
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,650
Are you guys staying here too?

341
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,750
Not are... we were.
We are checking out

342
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,500
We've been staying here for a week.
Isn't that right, guys?

343
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,760
Yes, we've been here for a week

344
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,090
But Akash just got here today.
- Yes. I got here today

345
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,300
Akash! It's nice to see you haven't
lost your sense of humour!

346
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,270
Hey Sid, look over there!

347
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,800
Sid, did you hear that?
Someone's calling out my name

348
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:15,450
Go faster, buddy. Faster
This is the top speed

349
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,150
What an amazing place!

350
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,730
We should come to Goa every year,
for a week at least

351
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:08,660
What say, Sid?

352
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,500
What are you thinking?

353
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:18,410
I'm looking at that ship...

354
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,120
...that's about to disappear over
the horizon

355
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,210
The three of us are like that ship

356
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,880
Soon, we'll set out looking
for our destinations...

357
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,400
...and it might just be that
our destinations are different

358
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:44,130
I don't understand why
you're saying all this

359
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:46,710
Sid, we are all friends...

360
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:50,140
...for life

361
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:51,210
Of course we are

362
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,980
But who knows where life will
take each one of us

363
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,250
Ever wondered, let alone come
here every year for a week...

364
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,850
It may be difficult to meet
even once in 10 years

365
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,290
That won't happen, Sid

366
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:16,160
We were, are and will be friends.
Always

367
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,270
Anyway, shall we go?
Deepa must be waiting for you

368
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,410
Don't say must be waiting.
She is!

369
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:33,240
I told her Akash will meet her
by the poolside at 8 sharp!

370
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,860
How strange is this journey!

371
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:49,000
If you just think...
Each one of us is so unaware...

372
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,100
...of where he is destined to go...

373
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:58,940
...of what the future
holds for each of us

374
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,460
The heart wants...

375
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,130
May these sparkling days never end

376
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,600
The heart wants...

377
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,380
May we never have to be
without our friends

378
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:39,290
May our days be full of poetry...

379
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:43,760
...our evenings dance
and nights sing

380
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:50,730
May our time together always
be fun and exciting

381
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:01,740
May every path we tread
bring us happiness

382
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:06,950
Our paths dazzle with their glitter

383
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,450
May this joy and light
be ours by right

384
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:17,720
Deepa, why do you like Akash
so much?

385
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,410
What do you mean?

386
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,530
Sometimes I wonder why we
like and want someone

387
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:29,190
Why do you like him?

388
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,940
I don't know... I just do

389
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:42,470
Even knowing that Akash...
...doesn't love me

390
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,120
Yes... then too

391
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:56,620
Deepa you are a good-Iooking,
intelligent girl.

392
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,320
You can get anyone you want...

393
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:02,730
In that case, why can't
I have Akash!

394
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:08,900
I don't know that...

395
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,930
But I do know that if
you're ever in trouble,

396
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,970
And need Akash's help or support,
he'll do whatever he can for you.

397
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,850
But Deepa, you shouldn't
hope for things that...

398
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,590
Take a look at this sand

399
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,330
The tighter you try to grip it...

400
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,030
...the faster it slips
through your fingers

401
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,740
Have you donated your bag
to the hotel?

402
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:20,170
Actually, I've decided to
stay back for a few days

403
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:21,950
What?

404
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,440
Er... Kristine wants me to stay
for some more time

405
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,110
Kristine? that girl who...

406
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:33,320
Sid! Are you listening? Our friend has
decided to become a hippie!

407
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,770
If you hadn't brought me here,
I'd have never met her

408
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:51,170
She's Swiss. I was wondering...
why not go there...

409
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,710
...and start a bee farm.
Swiss honey is world famous...

410
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,150
Let's go Akash

411
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,700
What have I done! He was
better off with Priya

412
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,170
One more thing...

413
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:26,340
Please don't call my house
till I get back

414
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,400
So, did you have fun in Goa?

415
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,740
It was great. Have you been there?

416
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,670
Yes. Many years ago

417
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,720
Whose photographs are these?

418
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,350
Esha... my daughter

419
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:21,290
Oh, I haven't met her.
Where is she?

420
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,900
She lives with her father

421
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:36,200
9th April 95... exactly
on my birthday...

422
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,180
My husband gave me a gift...

423
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:55,330
You do meet your daughter,
don't you?

424
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:57,960
No

425
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,430
The Court doesn't permit me
to meet my daughter

426
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:05,740
Why?

427
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:09,640
My ex-husband is a very rich man

428
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,870
His lawyers were very smart and
capable

429
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:19,120
With the help of many false
witnesses, he proved...

430
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:26,150
...that I am not a good mother.
That I'm an alcoholic

431
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:31,800
An irresponsible woman
who drinks

432
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,830
You're nothing like that!

433
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,640
Oh for you to have been
the judge!

434
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,480
Anyway, what else
did you do there?

435
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,820
I'd like to paint you

436
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,490
Paint me?

437
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,040
Be back in two minutes

438
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:00,020
Are you going somewhere?

439
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:01,880
Sorry, I have to go

440
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,920
I just got a call from the site.
There's a problem

441
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:46,060
Have you given any thought
to your future?

442
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:49,430
No

443
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:53,140
I know it's my fault...

444
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:58,280
...I always thought, I'd give
you some time... You needed it.

445
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:01,810
It's my pampering that
has spoilt you

446
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:04,450
If this goes on...

447
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:07,680
You'll definitely have signed
a cheque till my retirement

448
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:11,790
Dad, there are more things
to life than signing cheques

449
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,830
Really! And what are these things?

450
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,560
I don't know yet but the moment
I do, you'll be the first to know

451
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:26,040
I have had enough of your jokes

452
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,470
I've decided that you will go
to Australia

453
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,610
Cool! Another holiday?

454
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,240
You'll manage our business
there

455
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,750
Mom, Dad's joking now

456
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:42,590
No, Akash. Dad is serious
and you better be serious too

457
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:45,360
You are going to Sydney

458
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:49,830
And you will manage the office there

459
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:04,970
Sameerji's Mummyji is on the phone

460
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,590
Akash Baba says that...

461
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:13,210
Yes, Aunty

462
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,260
What's wrong with Sameer?

463
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,860
Nothing's wrong with Sameer.
He's perfectly OK

464
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:19,860
What OK!? He's shut himself
in his room

465
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:22,430
He hasn't eaten and just
doesn't come out

466
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,100
Sameer is in Bombay?

467
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,370
Didn't you all come back
last night

468
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:31,130
Yes, Aunty. It was last night
but... I'm so distracted now...

469
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,280
Akash, are you and Sameer on drugs?

470
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:37,240
Of course not, Aunty. Don't worry.
I'll be there right away

471
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:48,990
The least you could've done was call.

472
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,130
I didn't know what to say to your Mom

473
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:03,870
What's happened to you?

474
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,240
I'm in no mood to talk now

475
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,520
Okay. How's Kristine?

476
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:14,910
Don't even mention her name
in front of me!

477
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:17,250
Why? What happened?

478
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:25,660
Get it off your chest

479
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:29,270
It's not good for health
to suppress such emotions

480
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:38,340
Well, after the two of left
the other day...

481
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,440
I met Kristine on the beach

482
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:46,780
It felt so good...

483
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,510
Just Kristine and me...

484
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:56,320
I loved her so much...

485
00:59:58,830 --> 00:59:59,630
How happy I was...

486
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,890
We watched the sunset and she
came back to the hotel with me

487
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,160
I invited her in

488
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,830
I could never have imagined
what happened next

489
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,160
I don't think she was from
Switzerland either

490
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,690
I'm glad to have amused you guys!

491
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,560
That truck driver who gave me a ride
to Bombay was far more sympathetic!

492
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:42,460
You came back in a truck!?

493
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:45,400
What did you think?
That I sit on this pillow every day?

494
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:50,060
I'm pissed off travelling 12 hours
in a truck

495
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,770
Mother, he is Mr. Shankaran.
Art India magazines.

496
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:40,320
I was telling Siddharth about
my friend who lives in Kasauli

497
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,750
He hosts a painting workshop
every year

498
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,630
And you feel that he must
go there

499
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:46,800
Absolutely

500
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,160
It'll be a very good experience
for him

501
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:58,830
Oh, you're here!

502
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:04,170
You're a strange boy!
you invite me and act surprised when I come.

503
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:08,820
Ma, this is Tara!
Tara Jaiswal. You introduced us before

504
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:34,550
How long will you go around
with that glum face...

505
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:39,010
Come. Let me introduce you
to these sweet girls

506
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:40,680
Forget it man.

507
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:42,320
I'm not in the mood

508
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,620
Are you fine?

509
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,390
Look... Kristine!

510
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:11,380
Do you like it?

511
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,720
I like them all

512
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,920
It's difficult to say
which one is your best

513
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,460
I haven't painted my best yet

514
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:26,590
Why not?

515
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:28,630
You don't seem to have the time?

516
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:37,140
On such a big day in your life
I've to agree to your wish.

517
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:41,250
Tell me, when you will
start my painting?

518
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:42,420
Tomorrow

519
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,090
Wait, I'll be out in a minute.

520
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,590
- No problem

521
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:29,450
What season is this in which the
heart blooms like a flower.

522
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:44,310
What season is this in which the
heart blooms like a flower.

523
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:48,140
...in which the colours merge...

524
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:51,680
...and all the fragrances
blend

525
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:55,750
Moonlight, brooks
and clouds...

526
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:59,550
Songs, rain
and butterflies...

527
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:05,160
They all seem favourable to me

528
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:18,370
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

529
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,180
Oh look!

530
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:31,290
Banks of a river...

531
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:38,720
A bird calls out
to another bird

532
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:46,370
Look, at the river itself...

533
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:53,870
She flows on to unite
with the sea

534
01:06:56,150 --> 01:07:01,380
All these journeys
are part of love's caravan

535
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:11,550
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

536
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:50,770
Oh how

537
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:55,270
can I explain...

538
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:02,110
How can I make you understand
what love is!

539
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:10,290
There are no attachments
in love

540
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:17,450
And neither
are there any barriers

541
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:25,800
Love's saga is extraordinary

542
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:34,980
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

543
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:38,480
...in which all the colours merge...

544
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:41,990
...and all the fragrances
blend

545
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:45,920
Moonlight, brooks
and clouds...

546
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:49,820
Songs, rain
and butterflies...

547
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:56,160
They all seem favourable to me

548
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:05,170
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

549
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:50,590
Greetings, Aunty.

550
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,230
Are you going out, Sameer?

551
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:58,100
Ya, to Akash's... Why?

552
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:03,400
I'll be back

553
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,740
Mom! What's the matter?

554
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:20,680
The fact is, Nareshji's daughter
Pooja is coming here

555
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:24,930
And we want the two of you to...

556
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:27,760
What! Fixing my marriage...!

557
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,600
An arranged marriage!
No, Mom. Not for me

558
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,930
Why not? Your Daddy and I had
an arranged marriage

559
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:39,930
Listen to me. We are not forcing
you to get married

560
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,770
We have known them for years

561
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:44,280
And we thought we'd turn friendship
into a marriage alliance

562
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:48,120
You don't lose anything by
meeting Pooja, do you?

563
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:54,490
Okay. But you know my answer.
And that's NO!

564
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:01,460
Who is it, Sameer?

565
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:26,620
Er... Sameer, we have something
important to discuss

566
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,490
Nareshji, is that all right?

567
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,520
Anyway, they'll get bored
sitting with us oldies

568
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,690
Are they your friends?

569
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:01,790
Please sit down

570
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:09,190
This is Akash and this is Sid

571
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,870
Seems like a deep friendship

572
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,040
Either the friendship is deep
or it's a 3-D photograph

573
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:37,890
Pooja, you do know why
you're here, don't you?

574
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:41,660
Yes. Mom and Dad told me

575
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,230
Look, honestly speaking...

576
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,170
When Mom told me about this...
I felt it wasn't right at first...

577
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:56,080
...but now... I'm so happy you said no to
this arranged marriage bullshit!

578
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:04,080
I think marriages shouldn't be
made like this

579
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:07,090
It's so important to love somebody
to get married

580
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:08,550
What do you think?

581
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:09,920
Yes, absolutely

582
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,760
Why? Are you in love with
someone?

583
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:28,240
There is this guy in my life

584
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:31,340
But I guess I don't love him
enough so far to marry him

585
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,880
I pretty much feel the same...

586
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,180
...but not about the guy in your life!

587
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:43,990
And then?

588
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,830
Then what!
She went home

589
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,160
It's a problem man

590
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:03,670
Please don't tell me you've
fallen for her after all this!

591
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:08,350
Look, Sameer...

592
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:10,850
I have no doubt whatsoever
you have fallen in love with her

593
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:13,520
But I'm equally sure that after
3 months...

594
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,880
...you'll be in love with some other
girl

595
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:16,350
No, Akash

596
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:22,020
I always thought I knew
what love was

597
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:24,060
I realized today that I was
completely wrong

598
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:25,370
Is that so!

599
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,700
Akash, when Pooja told me about
that guy in her life...

600
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:33,270
For the first time I thought about
all those girls in my life...

601
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:35,040
I was attracted to all of them...

602
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,500
But I was wrong to think
the attraction was love

603
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:41,550
And now you love Pooja?

604
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:46,190
Yes. That's it!
I love Pooja

605
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:48,890
Then tell her

606
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,160
Take my advice. Don't say
anything to anyone

607
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:56,070
There's no trusting you

608
01:14:56,270 --> 01:14:57,730
Today it's Pooja,
tomorrow it'll be some Ahuja!

609
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:16,590
How did you know it's
my birthday?

610
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,250
Didn't you mention it?

611
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:22,250
I am so happy today

612
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:27,590
Guess what? Esha called me

613
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,770
She is coming to see me today

614
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:36,370
My daughter is coming here...

615
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:50,620
Sid, she remembered it's
my birthday today

616
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:57,450
I'll be seeing her after 5 years!

617
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:01,790
I've cooked everything myself.
I baked a cake

618
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:05,300
I'm so happy

619
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,460
Is Esha coming alone or your...

620
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:13,970
Oh no. She told him she's going to
a friend's birthday party...

621
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:18,140
Because Ajay will never let her
come here

622
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:23,050
Would you like to meet her?

623
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:26,320
It'll make me happy

624
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:37,660
How dare you teach my daughter
to lie? Have you no shame?

625
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:43,840
Thank God I heard Esha
talk to you over the phone

626
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:46,180
Why don't you stay away from her?

627
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,170
I am her mother!

628
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:52,010
You were her mother but now
Kiran is her mother

629
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,510
It'd be wise of you to understand
this

630
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:57,680
Don't ever try to meet Esha again

631
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,520
Not unless you want me to take
you to court... again

632
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:03,330
You understand what I'm getting at,
don't you?

633
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:47,740
He tells me I am not Esha's mother!

634
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:48,910
That Esha is not my daughter!

635
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:55,740
I am her mother...

636
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:02,320
He married again

637
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:06,910
He destroyed all my dreams.
I said nothing

638
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:10,750
Because I had everything...

639
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:13,590
I had my Esha

640
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,270
I have nothing at all

641
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:33,980
I am nothing. Nothing.

642
01:18:56,710 --> 01:19:01,510
You know, crying doesn't suit
you at all

643
01:19:03,850 --> 01:19:05,320
What else can I do!

644
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,820
You can come with me

645
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:08,370
You two must be wondering where
Siddharth has brought you!

646
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:11,210
No such thing. We'd go
anywhere to eat cake

647
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:20,050
Will you dance with me?

648
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,460
Where?
- Right here there's lot of space, come.

649
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:21,790
Sid, we've reached your house

650
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:28,460
What?

651
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:36,630
You're joking, right?

652
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:43,300
Hey Akash, he's serious man!

653
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:45,980
Have you gone mad?

654
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,320
Sid, my knowledge of such
things is a bit sad but...

655
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:57,450
...this is a but much, isn't it?

656
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:02,420
Is that because she's older?

657
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:05,160
No. I mean that too

658
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:09,160
Wait a minute! Why are we even
discussing this nonsense?

659
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:15,840
Because I thought that may be
you guys would understand

660
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:25,010
Hey Sid! Understand what?

661
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:30,850
You say you love a woman who
is 10 to 15 years older than you...

662
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:34,360
...has a daughter, had a husband

663
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:37,690
You've told us she has a
drinking problem

664
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,020
What should we understand?
- Just this...

665
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:41,520
I know all this and still
love her

666
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:46,000
But Sid, think about it.
This isn't love, it's insanity

667
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:48,870
No. This is love

668
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:54,210
I don't expect her to be mine
or marry me

669
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:55,880
I don't expect any such thing

670
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,210
Even if she doesn't love me,
it's okay because I...

671
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:02,720
okay! I get it

672
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:07,220
Remember, Sameer? Even I had
started off like this

673
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:11,490
Started what off?
Oh. Of course.

674
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:15,570
Okay, Sid. If that's what it's about
then I have no objection

675
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,900
In fact she's perfect for you

676
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,570
She's experienced, lives alone.
You visit her everyday

677
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:26,570
Learn from him, Sameer

678
01:23:26,910 --> 01:23:29,240
Really, Sid. You couldn't have
chosen better...

679
01:23:34,190 --> 01:23:36,090
How disgusting can you get!

680
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:43,460
Here I am telling you I love her and
you make it sound so sick and dirty

681
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,260
We don't have to approve
everything our friends do

682
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:55,100
But there is a line in every
friendship that shouldn't be crossed

683
01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:56,740
And you have crossed it today

684
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:06,050
At some point in life everyone
experiences true love

685
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:11,780
Then all the things you said...
about her age and stuff...

686
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:17,490
They don't mean anything.
They all seem trivial

687
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,890
You won't understand this today

688
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:26,970
But some day you will know...

689
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:29,040
You don't decide to fall in love

690
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:31,780
It just happens

691
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,810
Are you finished?

692
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:50,860
Sameer, are you coming?

693
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:41,320
I still remember that night

694
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:51,770
I never thought things would go
that far

695
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:59,270
I couldn't sleep all night

696
01:26:00,850 --> 01:26:02,340
I went and met Akash
the next morning

697
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:44,120
These things happen
between friends

698
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:47,920
Let's go meet Sid.
He must be feeling bad too

699
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,100
You're sure to run into him
somewhere

700
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:55,300
What'll you do? Ignore him?

701
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:03,100
You're coming to meet Sid

702
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:06,770
Leave me alone, Sameer!

703
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:34,340
I have to see Sid

704
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:35,570
He's gone

705
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:37,540
Where? - Kasauli

706
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:42,810
They called yesterday to say his
application was accepted. So he...

707
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:49,120
What is it, Sameer?
Is everything alright?

708
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,220
Of course. I should go

709
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:04,570
I didn't realise that things
would never be the same again

710
01:28:05,470 --> 01:28:09,880
You went to Kasauli... A week later,
Akash left for Australia

711
01:28:21,490 --> 01:28:22,720
Take care of yourself

712
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:26,420
You remember the name of the man
who'll receive you in Sydney?

713
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:29,750
Mr. Mehta... Relax, Dad.
I remember

714
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,600
Bye. I'll call you from there

715
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,170
I must tell you something
- What's it?

716
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:51,980
I always made fun of your
endless romantic entanglements

717
01:28:54,190 --> 01:28:57,550
Never stopped to think how you
must feel

718
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:03,020
You know I was just kidding,
don't you?

719
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:07,760
Don't worry about it

720
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:09,830
You weren't the only one who was
kidding

721
01:29:11,370 --> 01:29:12,460
You remember Shalini?

722
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:16,430
I remember Shalini...
And Rohit's punch as well

723
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,570
I knew she was Rohit's fiancee

724
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:23,870
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you stop me?

725
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:52,280
I said Hi

726
01:29:56,150 --> 01:29:57,080
Where are you going?

727
01:29:58,990 --> 01:30:00,420
This flight goes to Sydney

728
01:30:01,150 --> 01:30:02,180
But where are you going?

729
01:30:04,990 --> 01:30:07,150
How strange! All three of us
are going to Sydney

730
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:08,860
Three?

731
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:10,920
Sure. You, me, and this flight

732
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:16,760
You do know you're insane,
don't you?

733
01:30:25,510 --> 01:30:28,450
I'm really sorry about
the other night

734
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:30,910
I was just kidding

735
01:30:39,490 --> 01:30:39,980
So what are you...

736
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:45,350
What are you doing in Sydney?

737
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:49,060
Dad has a business there he
wants me to manage...

738
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:52,670
Let's see how long it lasts now.
And you?

739
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:54,970
My uncle lives there

740
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:57,710
My mother's brother.
I'm visiting him

741
01:30:58,240 --> 01:30:59,140
He's nothing like Rohit, is he!

742
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:04,240
What does he do?

743
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:09,180
Have you been to Sydney before?

744
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:12,880
Do you always ask so many
questions?

745
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:15,720
Yes. Have you been to Sydney
before?

746
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:17,000
Yes

747
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:19,960
Good. You can show me around

748
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,730
Wait a minute. Don't you know
anybody else there?

749
01:31:24,570 --> 01:31:25,800
Of course. There is a Mr. Mehta

750
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:29,610
And won't it be fun hanging out
with him?

751
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:35,150
I said I'm sorry

752
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:38,110
Okay but I will have to ask
my uncle

753
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:41,880
But he won't refuse.

754
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:42,990
Why?

755
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,020
Because I have bought him a gift!

756
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:19,950
I'm fine but please stop
calling me uncle now

757
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:22,490
You've grown up which makes us
practically the same age

758
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:34,900
So, is it a business trip?

759
01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:38,870
We have an export business and
Dad's exported me here to handle it

760
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:40,810
Exports? Sounds very boring, man

761
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:41,850
That's what I think too

762
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,440
Personally, I prefer something more
adventurous...

763
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:46,380
...like wild life photography

764
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,020
You like photography?

765
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:53,360
Mum says the first word I said
wasn't Papa or Mama...

766
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:54,390
It was camera!

767
01:32:58,670 --> 01:32:59,130
I'm Steve

768
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,830
Steve? - Satyadev Mehta

769
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:08,200
I've organized a car for you.
I'll get your trolley

770
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,540
Okay Shalini, I'll take your leave.
Bye, Mahesh

771
01:33:14,350 --> 01:33:19,840
Here's my card. If you need
anything in Sydney, call me

772
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:49,550
Well, I'd better leave now.
I'm sure you want to rest

773
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:51,850
I'll send the driver to pick you
up tomorrow

774
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,780
Yes, I'll tell Mr. Mehta

775
01:34:46,310 --> 01:34:48,800
Dad wants you to send him
a copy of the new contract

776
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:53,510
You are coming to the meeting
tomorrow, aren't you?

777
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,180
Can you give me our transaction
file?

778
01:34:57,450 --> 01:34:59,080
I'd like to know a little more about
them before the meeting

779
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:00,890
I'll send you the file right away

780
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:08,230
Is there a good restaurant around
here?

781
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,550
Being alone in a new city
can be so boring

782
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:38,590
But you aren't alone!

783
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:40,490
Who said I was bored?

784
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,930
Who'd have thought that
someday you

785
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:49,000
and me would be sitting
here like friends

786
01:35:51,610 --> 01:35:52,630
Especially after all that happened...

787
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:56,400
So how is Rohit?

788
01:35:57,950 --> 01:36:00,380
He's fine. I spoke to him
this morning

789
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:05,040
I told him I met you on the flight
and...

790
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:10,450
And he doesn't like you meeting
me! Right?

791
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:17,700
But you're here.
Why?

792
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:20,230
Akash, you don't know Rohit.

793
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:22,700
He doesn't like me meeting
any boys

794
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:26,770
But Rohit is a good guy

795
01:36:27,710 --> 01:36:32,580
He has a few faults but then,
don't we all. Me... you...

796
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,510
Faults... and me!

797
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:39,480
So tell me about yourself

798
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:41,920
What do you want to know?

799
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:51,190
Of course I have. But not for
more than 2 weeks

800
01:36:52,330 --> 01:36:54,530
Then there's another girlfriend...
another 2 weeks...

801
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,200
And then another...

802
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,340
stop! I understand how your
girlfriend system works

803
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:02,540
What I don't understand is...
why?

804
01:37:03,910 --> 01:37:07,310
The fact is, I've seen many of my
friends with their "beloveds"

805
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:10,110
They have everything but love
for each other

806
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:13,240
That's why I think I am better off
as I am

807
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,490
No questions... no answers

808
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:20,690
I don't ask Rohit questions,
nor do I demand answers

809
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:23,460
But he asks questions.
He demands answers

810
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,130
I never said it's always
the girl's fault

811
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:31,170
But relationships just get like that.
Start with joy and end in grief

812
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:36,200
I see! So this is the result of
an end in grief

813
01:37:37,610 --> 01:37:39,380
Now I've understood your
2 weeks formula!

814
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:40,710
No! It's nothing of the sort

815
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:44,420
I have consciously decided not to
fall in love and ruin my life

816
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:48,750
But love isn't about decisions.
It just happens

817
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:50,420
Then I don't let it happen to me

818
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:53,920
Give it some time. I'm sure
it will some day

819
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:59,090
Why? Are you proposing?

820
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:09,770
How was your day?

821
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:15,110
Akash is nuts

822
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:40,370
Turn it down guys.
It's my wife-to-be

823
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:43,870
How are you?

824
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:45,880
Hopefully a little less drunk

825
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:50,720
Did you get my message?
Where were you?

826
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:52,880
I met Akash for lunch

827
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:00,380
I told you not to meet him!
Why don't you listen to me?

828
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:04,890
Are you yelling at me in front
of your friends?

829
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:13,900
I am coming there. It'll take some
time but I will be there

830
01:39:15,610 --> 01:39:17,910
As you wish, Rohit. Bye

831
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:27,850
Pooja, I was in the neighbourhood
and I thought...

832
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:32,020
Pooja, if you aren't doing
anything else...

833
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:37,360
Pooja, I was in the neighbour...

834
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:40,530
Bye mom, I'll call later

835
01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:23,410
Fine. And you?

836
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:29,250
Subodh, this is Sameer.
Sameer, this is Subodh

837
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:41,590
Are you waiting for someone?

838
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:45,600
Yes. But it seems like
they won't show up now

839
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:55,000
So tell me... what's the plan
after dinner?

840
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:56,670
No plan

841
01:40:58,550 --> 01:40:59,670
Come on, let's do something

842
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:02,680
What say, Subodh?

843
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:05,520
I'm sorry. I've made it a habit
to sleep by 10

844
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:09,520
One night won't change
your habit

845
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:12,200
Come on, pal. Anyway,
it's Sunday tomorrow

846
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:15,360
I know. Thing is I've to wake up at
5 and do Yoga

847
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:19,040
Then some jogging and breakfast
at 8 sharp

848
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:21,370
And since it's Sunday...

849
01:41:21,910 --> 01:41:23,700
...we spend the day at Kumar uncle's
beach house

850
01:41:27,010 --> 01:41:27,480
I'll be right back

851
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,180
It's time for his bathroom break,
right?

852
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:38,180
He isn't that bad

853
01:41:42,230 --> 01:41:43,520
So where are you off to?

854
01:41:44,230 --> 01:41:44,690
Let's see...

855
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:49,690
If Time Table doesn't want to
come, may be you can join me

856
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:51,870
I'm sure I can...

857
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:00,540
If I call you sometime...

858
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:20,960
Wow! What're we celebrating?

859
01:42:22,170 --> 01:42:22,790
You don't remember?

860
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:27,970
It was on this day five months ago
that I told you what I felt for you

861
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:43,380
To Subodh and Pooja!

862
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:51,060
What's the situation like?
- Pretty intense

863
01:42:55,830 --> 01:42:56,460
Really, Mahesh

864
01:42:57,830 --> 01:43:01,790
There were such intense scenes
in the film! So moving...

865
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:04,310
Please cut out the performance

866
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:07,800
And forgive me for taking you
to see such a good film!

867
01:43:09,180 --> 01:43:10,300
You see! That's my biggest problem

868
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:12,480
I can't bear watching good films

869
01:43:13,850 --> 01:43:17,480
Yes. You only like those
wham bang action films

870
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:19,490
Anyway, that's all you can
understand...

871
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:22,820
...because they don't require you
to use your brains or heart!

872
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:25,660
You need plenty of brains for
these love stories

873
01:43:26,530 --> 01:43:29,160
She sits here shedding tears,
he sits there sighing...

874
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:31,660
...what's all this lovey- dovey
stuff about anyway!

875
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,000
You won't understand

876
01:43:35,870 --> 01:43:37,000
What're you doing man, let's go

877
01:43:56,730 --> 01:44:00,030
Wonder why
people fall in love

878
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:07,700
Wonder why people
are ready to die for someone

879
01:44:11,910 --> 01:44:15,210
Wonder why
people fall in love

880
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:19,040
Wonder why people
are ready to die for someone

881
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:23,710
Wonder why,
Oh wonder why...

882
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:30,880
Wonder why... why... why!

883
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:39,230
Just think about it,
there is only grief in love

884
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:44,230
As for love's cruelty,
it's past counting

885
01:44:45,610 --> 01:44:49,740
When in love
your head must remain bowed

886
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:54,910
Even when in pain
you have to smile

887
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:58,250
Why fill your own life
with poison?

888
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:05,920
Wonder why
people fall in love

889
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:11,420
Wonder why,
Oh wonder why

890
01:45:12,970 --> 01:45:16,600
Wonder why why... why...

891
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:27,780
Without love
what's left in life

892
01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:35,950
Without love
A person is Ionely

893
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,800
Without love
what's there in life

894
01:45:44,330 --> 01:45:47,460
Without love
A person is Ionely

895
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:51,300
Love brings colour
into your life

896
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:55,140
Love brings beauty
into your life

897
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:58,980
People fall in love
but hide it

898
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:06,480
Wonder why they fear
expressing it openly

899
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:11,980
Wonder why,
Oh wonder why...

900
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,990
Wonder why why why!

901
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:07,540
Love is just
needless trouble

902
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:12,720
Love is beautiful
in every aspect

903
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:17,710
We are all better off
far away from love

904
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:22,720
Love's every form
is the assured truth

905
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:27,400
He that tests love's
waters...

906
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:31,230
...neither drowns nor floats

907
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:34,240
Wonder why?

908
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:37,570
Everyone but everyone
falls in love

909
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:41,750
Wonder why only you
keep avoiding it

910
01:47:41,950 --> 01:47:45,750
Wonder why...

911
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:48,080
Wonder why...

912
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:53,580
Wonder why why why!

913
01:48:27,530 --> 01:48:28,330
Tell me something Shalini

914
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:30,830
Why're you so scared of
sitting on these rides?

915
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:32,500
I m not scared

916
01:48:33,870 --> 01:48:38,500
I think only those who aren't right
in their heads enjoy these rides

917
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:41,840
Interesting excuse

918
01:48:42,710 --> 01:48:44,840
You need courage to sit on
these rides! You need guts

919
01:48:46,050 --> 01:48:48,350
But don't worry. There are many
cowards like you around here

920
01:48:49,550 --> 01:48:50,850
Look. There's one right there

921
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:56,690
It's not like that at all

922
01:48:57,390 --> 01:49:01,520
If it isn't like that, then get on
that ride with me

923
01:49:06,570 --> 01:49:07,700
Why? No guts?

924
01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:10,360
It's getting late

925
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:17,710
I'm going on that ride

926
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:21,720
If you want, you can come with me.
Or sit here and get bored

927
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:30,790
Absolutely no guts

928
01:50:29,950 --> 01:50:31,920
Hurry. We can catch this train

929
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:53,720
Really Shalini! How could you
scare that poor old man!

930
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:10,110
How did it go?

931
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:13,610
Really well. They like my work

932
01:53:13,990 --> 01:53:17,440
And... they want me to
come back

933
01:53:18,490 --> 01:53:19,460
That's great

934
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:21,290
When will you have to go?

935
01:53:21,990 --> 01:53:24,290
I've just returned and you're
asking about my leaving

936
01:53:27,170 --> 01:53:28,460
Did you talk to Sameer?

937
01:53:28,830 --> 01:53:29,460
No. Why?

938
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:33,140
He came over the morning
you left

939
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,800
He seemed very troubled

940
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:39,810
What did he say?
- Nothing

941
01:53:49,350 --> 01:53:51,820
When did you get back?

942
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:56,990
How are you? How's everything?

943
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:58,660
Great. How are things with you
man?

944
01:53:59,030 --> 01:54:00,660
It's a very long story

945
01:54:01,030 --> 01:54:02,160
Let's go up and talk

946
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,470
Okay, so here's the situation

947
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:12,970
You are pretty good friends.
Hang out together

948
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:15,140
But you still haven't told her
how you feel

949
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:17,970
I've tried very hard...

950
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:22,650
But the words just don't come out

951
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:27,980
Didn't she have a boyfriend?

952
01:54:30,030 --> 01:54:31,650
Yup. She did... but not anymore

953
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:34,660
I don't know what Pooja saw
in him

954
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:37,670
I mean he was sweet
but what a bore!

955
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:43,170
One day I made the mistake of
going for a drive with them

956
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:46,210
See this place...

957
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:49,540
I met Pooja for the first time
on 15th September right here

958
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:56,210
Exactly 7 days later, we came here
to have ice cream... 22nd September

959
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:01,220
You wouldn't remember the time,
would you?

960
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:05,060
Of course I remember.
It was exactly 5.55

961
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:14,230
That's not all

962
01:55:15,110 --> 01:55:18,230
He'd buy her a balloon
everyday

963
01:55:18,610 --> 01:55:19,230
Balloon...?

964
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:24,740
Yes. You know those heart shaped
ones you get at signals

965
01:55:28,290 --> 01:55:30,750
It's okay but...
Everyday!

966
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:31,920
One balloon a day!

967
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:39,400
I knew the guy was deranged

968
01:55:49,610 --> 01:55:53,240
If you love Pooja so much,
why haven't you told her?

969
01:55:55,780 --> 01:55:56,910
I was afraid...

970
01:55:58,780 --> 01:56:01,750
What if Pooja says no?

971
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:06,750
I'd even lose this friendship
we share now...

972
01:56:07,630 --> 01:56:08,590
and be all alone

973
01:56:13,630 --> 01:56:16,430
You weren't here.
Nor was Akash

974
01:56:22,970 --> 01:56:23,940
Anyway, you're here now

975
01:56:24,810 --> 01:56:26,780
And I feel stronger knowing
that you're here for me

976
01:56:28,150 --> 01:56:29,440
I'm always here for you, Sameer

977
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:34,280
Then... shall I tell her today?

978
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:37,780
Tell her

979
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:43,620
Pooja, there's something
I need to tell you

980
01:56:46,660 --> 01:56:51,290
I wonder what if the arranging
incident hadn't happened

981
01:56:54,010 --> 01:56:56,800
If we hadn't met the way we
did...

982
01:56:57,680 --> 01:57:00,970
If I had met you somewhere else,
would we be the same as we are now?

983
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:04,650
And if we weren't the way we are,
how else would we be?

984
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:06,480
If you thought differently
about me...

985
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:08,810
...if I thought differently about
you, what'd happen?

986
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:14,550
What's happening now?
...What am I saying?

987
01:57:16,430 --> 01:57:21,730
Just a lot of ifs!
What's the matter?

988
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:25,900
The matter is just that...

989
01:57:28,110 --> 01:57:29,230
I'm falling in love with you

990
01:57:31,950 --> 01:57:34,240
I agree that we don't know
each other very well

991
01:57:41,290 --> 01:57:45,420
If you trust me at all, believe
that I am telling the truth

992
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:34,060
I look everywhere for her.
But I still haven't found her

993
01:58:34,270 --> 01:58:39,580
Where is the girl
in whose love I can believe?

994
01:58:44,450 --> 01:58:46,750
She who loves only me

995
01:58:46,950 --> 01:58:49,250
She must be even ready
to say...

996
01:58:49,460 --> 01:58:51,750
"O listen, you are the one
who has my heart"

997
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:54,760
Oh, where is that girl?

998
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:09,430
She who lives in your dream
as love's beautiful embodiment...

999
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:11,940
You will find her someday
or other

1000
01:59:12,150 --> 01:59:15,110
Just look here and there

1001
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:22,120
Let's both go and find her...

1002
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:24,620
This angel, this fairy,
this damsel so dainty...

1003
01:59:24,830 --> 01:59:27,120
...who upon seeing,
you will say

1004
01:59:27,330 --> 01:59:30,130
She is right here!

1005
02:00:05,530 --> 02:00:09,160
I wonder why
I had this thought...

1006
02:00:09,870 --> 02:00:15,500
Could you be the
dream girl?

1007
02:00:15,710 --> 02:00:25,180
You have all the graces
that I search for everywhere

1008
02:00:25,390 --> 02:00:27,850
I think you are deluded

1009
02:00:28,050 --> 02:00:30,350
I wonder what you think I am

1010
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,860
I am no angel or fairy
nor any celestial nymph

1011
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:36,030
Don't have any such
illusions

1012
02:00:40,730 --> 02:00:45,540
I look everywhere for her.
But I still haven't found her

1013
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:51,040
Where is the girl
in whose love I can believe?

1014
02:01:26,450 --> 02:01:30,410
Suppose I say to you...

1015
02:01:30,620 --> 02:01:36,420
All I think of
is you and only you

1016
02:01:36,620 --> 02:01:40,580
You must know
this is what I desire...

1017
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:46,260
...you must be with me,
only with me

1018
02:01:46,470 --> 02:01:48,760
Oh, what have you made me believe!

1019
02:01:48,970 --> 02:01:51,270
Oh, how you make my heart beat!

1020
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:53,770
You melt my body and soul...

1021
02:01:53,970 --> 02:01:56,770
...reciting this saga of yours

1022
02:02:06,650 --> 02:02:11,450
I look everywhere for her.
But I still haven't found her

1023
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:14,460
Where is the girl
in whose love I can believe?

1024
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:19,120
Oh, where is that girl?
That girl is here!

1025
02:02:19,330 --> 02:02:35,310
Where is that girl?
- That girl is here!

1026
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:06,010
I can't believe that it's already
time for you to leave

1027
02:03:08,050 --> 02:03:10,020
Don't worry, Mom.
I'll be back soon

1028
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:12,020
Three months is not soon

1029
02:03:13,550 --> 02:03:14,680
And that's this time

1030
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:18,520
You don't know how long
you'll be gone next time

1031
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:25,860
Siddharth... have you thought about
marriage?

1032
02:03:26,070 --> 02:03:26,690
Mom!

1033
02:03:28,570 --> 02:03:29,540
What Mom!

1034
02:03:32,070 --> 02:03:35,370
Some other time, okay?
- But why? Why not now?

1035
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:43,880
It's just... forget it, Mom.
You won't understand

1036
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:49,710
I'm your mother! If I can't
understand you, who else will?

1037
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:53,880
Is there someone you like?

1038
02:03:59,270 --> 02:04:01,230
Sid, what's the matter?

1039
02:04:02,270 --> 02:04:03,900
You've never hidden anything
from me

1040
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:06,570
Yes, Ma. But there are some things
that you just can't tell somebody

1041
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:08,070
Yes there are...

1042
02:04:08,780 --> 02:04:12,070
But I can see there's something
eating away at you inside

1043
02:04:12,450 --> 02:04:14,570
Will you keep it bottled up inside
all your life?

1044
02:04:21,950 --> 02:04:23,580
Ma, I'm telling you
you won't understand!

1045
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:25,580
Why won't I understand?

1046
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:28,430
Try telling me

1047
02:04:32,130 --> 02:04:34,760
What is this thing that I don't
have the right to know?

1048
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:39,760
What's the matter?

1049
02:04:52,150 --> 02:04:53,120
That Tara Jaiswal?

1050
02:04:55,890 --> 02:04:58,020
I've met her so many times...
But... she...

1051
02:05:00,730 --> 02:05:01,850
When did this start?

1052
02:05:03,060 --> 02:05:04,530
I don't know when...

1053
02:05:06,570 --> 02:05:08,190
I won't let you ruin your life!

1054
02:05:09,070 --> 02:05:11,200
Have you any inkling of what
you are saying?

1055
02:05:12,410 --> 02:05:14,370
My son has fallen in love with
a woman who...

1056
02:05:15,070 --> 02:05:16,700
You were right I wouldn't
understand

1057
02:05:18,240 --> 02:05:20,870
And what has she told you,
that she loves you?

1058
02:05:21,250 --> 02:05:23,880
She must've seduced you with her
sad stories

1059
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:25,640
What did she say to you?
- She said nothing!

1060
02:05:32,190 --> 02:05:33,160
She doesn't even know that I...

1061
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:44,330
Your mother is absolutely right,
Siddharth

1062
02:05:45,370 --> 02:05:50,330
Don't ruin your life over me. And the
little peace I have left in my life...

1063
02:05:51,210 --> 02:05:53,340
Please don't take it away
from me

1064
02:06:13,470 --> 02:06:16,440
Go away! - Please listen to me

1065
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:17,610
I don't want to hear anything

1066
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:21,940
Have I ever made you feel
that I love you...

1067
02:06:22,140 --> 02:06:23,770
...or want a relationship
with you?

1068
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:25,950
No

1069
02:06:26,650 --> 02:06:28,120
Then what made you think...

1070
02:06:28,650 --> 02:06:29,780
...that you and I could...

1071
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:31,620
...have any such relationship?

1072
02:06:35,490 --> 02:06:37,120
This is the problem with your
generation

1073
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:43,290
You all think anything goes.
But that's not so, Siddharth

1074
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:48,300
Why just me?

1075
02:06:49,170 --> 02:06:50,470
You have also caused your mother
a lot of pain

1076
02:06:53,010 --> 02:06:53,800
Please sit down

1077
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:27,340
I'm so sorry that I caused you
and my mother such pain

1078
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:33,680
I'm sorry you had to hear
all this because of me

1079
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:39,190
But it's true that I love you

1080
02:07:53,030 --> 02:07:56,330
It's also true that I never
wanted you to know it

1081
02:07:58,510 --> 02:07:59,970
Because I knew that you...

1082
02:08:02,010 --> 02:08:02,810
...would never be able to understand

1083
02:08:08,250 --> 02:08:09,720
I just want to see you happy

1084
02:08:14,590 --> 02:08:19,550
And if knowing the truth
has caused you pain today...

1085
02:08:22,260 --> 02:08:25,560
All I can say is, that wasn't
my intention

1086
02:08:37,950 --> 02:08:41,070
Sid, please leave now

1087
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:16,380
After the workshop...

1088
02:09:19,090 --> 02:09:21,560
I think I'll go stay at uncle's
farm house for a while

1089
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:25,230
It's a good place to paint

1090
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:36,730
Will you come with me?

1091
02:09:40,780 --> 02:09:42,240
I don't want to go without you

1092
02:10:20,820 --> 02:10:21,440
Just a minute...

1093
02:11:17,910 --> 02:11:18,870
You look very lovely

1094
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:26,880
So, why are we here?

1095
02:11:28,250 --> 02:11:32,050
To prove to you that a thing called
love does exist in this world

1096
02:11:35,260 --> 02:11:36,550
Don't you ever give up?

1097
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:39,390
Shut up and lets go in

1098
02:12:07,460 --> 02:12:09,750
Why are we here?
- To watch an opera

1099
02:12:11,130 --> 02:12:11,920
Yes, but why?

1100
02:12:13,290 --> 02:12:14,760
You'll know when the time comes

1101
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:24,490
The girl's name is Cressida
and the boy is Troilus

1102
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:27,830
They love each other very much

1103
02:13:47,060 --> 02:13:48,520
But Troilus must go now

1104
02:13:49,890 --> 02:13:51,860
He has to go to war for his country

1105
02:13:53,730 --> 02:13:56,200
Cressida is afraid something may
happen to him

1106
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:00,530
Troilus is telling her
nothing will happen to him

1107
02:15:21,820 --> 02:15:27,450
This is the spirit of Troilus...
standing at heaven's gate

1108
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:30,630
But he doesn't want to go inside

1109
02:15:33,330 --> 02:15:35,130
He is asking God for one day

1110
02:15:37,670 --> 02:15:39,460
He wants to meet Cressida for
one last time

1111
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:44,800
And tell her how much he loves her

1112
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:49,810
If he is given one day...

1113
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:53,480
He is willing to die a thousand
deaths

1114
02:16:01,530 --> 02:16:03,150
Shut your eyes, Akash

1115
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:09,670
Think...

1116
02:16:11,200 --> 02:16:11,670
Who is it...

1117
02:16:13,370 --> 02:16:16,830
...to spend that one day with, you
are willing to die a thousand deaths

1118
02:16:19,540 --> 02:16:20,510
Who is it, Akash?

1119
02:17:57,910 --> 02:17:59,210
No so easily!

1120
02:18:00,740 --> 02:18:03,040
You still haven't told me
who you saw

1121
02:18:05,750 --> 02:18:07,220
You seem quite sure that I
saw someone?

1122
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:09,720
Yes. Because today for
the first time...

1123
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:12,220
...you're talking less
and thinking more!

1124
02:18:24,170 --> 02:18:24,790
Then listen

1125
02:18:27,170 --> 02:18:27,800
I saw her...

1126
02:18:30,170 --> 02:18:30,800
And I felt...

1127
02:18:31,010 --> 02:18:33,640
...perhaps this is what
they call love

1128
02:18:41,180 --> 02:18:42,310
I wanted to touch her...

1129
02:18:44,690 --> 02:18:45,990
...hold her in my arms...

1130
02:18:49,190 --> 02:18:51,990
I saw such innocence
in her eyes...

1131
02:18:54,860 --> 02:18:55,990
...like I see in your eyes now

1132
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:01,830
Her voice...

1133
02:19:02,210 --> 02:19:03,830
...had the kind of magic
your voice has

1134
02:19:06,040 --> 02:19:09,840
I can still feel the fragrance
of her breath...

1135
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:11,510
...like I can feel
in your breath now

1136
02:19:13,680 --> 02:19:14,480
Who was she?

1137
02:19:25,900 --> 02:19:27,020
That fat opera singer!

1138
02:19:45,080 --> 02:19:51,380
Shalini, come inside... at once!

1139
02:20:45,980 --> 02:20:47,600
I think the two of you should
talk alone

1140
02:20:57,090 --> 02:20:59,560
Where had you gone?
- To the opera

1141
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:02,620
With Akash!

1142
02:21:04,490 --> 02:21:06,790
How many times have I told you
not to meet him!

1143
02:21:10,170 --> 02:21:13,470
Rohit, will you keep telling me
all my life...

1144
02:21:13,670 --> 02:21:15,140
...who I should or should not meet!

1145
02:21:18,510 --> 02:21:19,130
Yes. I will

1146
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:23,140
And you will never see Akash
again. You got that?

1147
02:21:29,690 --> 02:21:32,810
Rohit, I need some time to think
and you need it too

1148
02:22:53,410 --> 02:22:56,700
Shalini had called.
She said it's important

1149
02:23:09,090 --> 02:23:10,890
Hi, Rohit. It's Akash

1150
02:23:12,420 --> 02:23:14,720
Is Shalini there? She had called

1151
02:23:15,260 --> 02:23:19,060
I know. We are going back...
to get married

1152
02:23:24,770 --> 02:23:25,740
Can I speak to Shalini?

1153
02:23:53,700 --> 02:23:55,170
That's good news

1154
02:23:57,800 --> 02:23:59,430
Akash, we are going back tomorrow

1155
02:24:00,810 --> 02:24:02,270
Can you come for dinner tonight?

1156
02:24:05,310 --> 02:24:07,440
I don't know. Bye

1157
02:24:24,830 --> 02:24:25,960
Hey, Akash! We thought you
weren't going to make it

1158
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:11,010
They're beautiful. Thanks

1159
02:25:12,710 --> 02:25:13,400
What will you drink?

1160
02:25:15,150 --> 02:25:18,410
We can drink later. Let's eat first.
I'm starving

1161
02:25:45,410 --> 02:25:48,210
Shalini, have you told
Mahesh Uncle...

1162
02:25:48,410 --> 02:25:49,880
...how you and Akash met?

1163
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:54,440
No?

1164
02:25:57,220 --> 02:25:58,380
Really, Mahesh Uncle...

1165
02:25:58,960 --> 02:26:01,220
I don't know what you'd have
done if you were there

1166
02:26:01,430 --> 02:26:02,550
What happened?

1167
02:26:04,360 --> 02:26:06,060
It was at my graduation
party

1168
02:26:06,730 --> 02:26:07,390
Shalini was with me

1169
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:09,660
Perhaps Akash didn't know
that...

1170
02:26:19,940 --> 02:26:21,240
Sorry for the punch

1171
02:26:24,620 --> 02:26:27,080
No, Rohit. It was my fault

1172
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:33,090
But to tell you the truth,
I think I was lucky

1173
02:26:34,430 --> 02:26:34,910
What do you mean?

1174
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:38,820
I mean, if Shalini was with me...

1175
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:41,930
...and someone had acted fresh...

1176
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:44,930
I'd have killed him

1177
02:26:58,450 --> 02:26:58,940
That is...

1178
02:27:00,290 --> 02:27:01,780
If Shalini was with you

1179
02:27:34,690 --> 02:27:35,280
Hey, wait...

1180
02:27:56,270 --> 02:27:58,830
You're coming to our wedding,
aren't you?

1181
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:02,680
No, I can't make it. There's a lot
of work to be done

1182
02:28:05,020 --> 02:28:06,010
Some friend you are!

1183
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:10,180
Anyway, don't forget to call us to
your wedding

1184
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:11,850
We'll definitely be there

1185
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:14,520
I'm not going to get married

1186
02:28:15,260 --> 02:28:15,850
Why?

1187
02:28:18,300 --> 02:28:20,860
It's necessary to love someone
to get married

1188
02:28:21,730 --> 02:28:23,200
And I believe...

1189
02:28:23,570 --> 02:28:25,370
...this thing called love doesn't
exist in the world

1190
02:28:27,970 --> 02:28:29,670
Shalini and I love each other

1191
02:28:29,910 --> 02:28:31,710
That's why we're getting married.
Isn't that so, Shalini?

1192
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:39,710
You both shouldn't ask each other
this question. Ask yourself

1193
02:28:45,760 --> 02:28:46,550
I better go

1194
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:21,750
You left your jacket with me
the other night

1195
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:40,600
Some day I want to tell you why
I am marrying Rohit

1196
02:29:40,810 --> 02:29:44,770
Why? What's the need to tell me?

1197
02:29:47,450 --> 02:29:48,280
I need to...

1198
02:29:49,620 --> 02:29:51,280
Because we both know...

1199
02:29:54,390 --> 02:29:56,290
...that night at the opera,
when you shut your eyes...

1200
02:29:57,630 --> 02:30:00,120
...it wasn't the fat opera singer
you saw

1201
02:30:26,530 --> 02:30:33,160
Loneliness

1202
02:30:36,300 --> 02:30:40,670
This Ioneliness...

1203
02:30:46,150 --> 02:30:50,850
Why have I stumbled on
the path of love

1204
02:30:51,150 --> 02:30:55,680
All my dreams lie shattered
A sense of gloom lies heavy

1205
02:30:55,890 --> 02:31:00,350
Every joy is be numbed

1206
02:31:00,730 --> 02:31:05,790
My very life is lost

1207
02:31:06,070 --> 02:31:10,770
I am being punished
for loving you

1208
02:31:10,970 --> 02:31:15,840
Loneliness...

1209
02:31:16,280 --> 02:31:20,580
Loneliness stretches over
miles and miles

1210
02:32:10,130 --> 02:32:15,590
In my dream I saw
a hand in my hand

1211
02:32:20,140 --> 02:32:25,770
Now I am blinded by the
shards of a shattered dream

1212
02:32:39,990 --> 02:32:44,450
Someone was here yesterday

1213
02:32:44,670 --> 02:32:49,760
but today there is no one

1214
02:32:50,170 --> 02:32:54,970
Like a cobra's venomous hiss
it envelopes my very breath...

1215
02:32:55,180 --> 02:32:59,840
...this Ioneliness

1216
02:33:00,220 --> 02:33:04,410
has brought tears to my eyes

1217
02:33:54,400 --> 02:33:59,860
Oh how could my hope for
something be so futile

1218
02:34:04,340 --> 02:34:10,150
I've embarked on a journey
to which there is no destination

1219
02:34:23,930 --> 02:34:28,230
Where should I go?

1220
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:33,700
To whom shall I explain?

1221
02:34:34,140 --> 02:34:36,230
What I had wanted...

1222
02:34:36,440 --> 02:34:38,740
And why I ended up with...

1223
02:34:38,950 --> 02:34:43,910
...this Ioneliness

1224
02:34:44,120 --> 02:34:48,250
Loneliness
deeply dark as the night

1225
02:34:58,770 --> 02:35:03,600
Why have I stumbled on
the path of love

1226
02:35:03,800 --> 02:35:08,240
All my dreams lie shattered
A sense of gloom lies heavy

1227
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:13,110
Every joy is be numbed

1228
02:35:13,310 --> 02:35:18,620
My very life is lost

1229
02:35:18,920 --> 02:35:23,450
I am being punished
for loving you

1230
02:35:23,660 --> 02:35:28,320
Loneliness...

1231
02:35:28,830 --> 02:35:33,130
Loneliness stretches over
miles and miles

1232
02:36:20,380 --> 02:36:21,610
Hello, Aunty. Is Sameer home?

1233
02:36:21,950 --> 02:36:22,680
Who is this?

1234
02:36:26,590 --> 02:36:29,520
You want to talk to Sameer
and you've called Siddharth!

1235
02:36:30,590 --> 02:36:31,350
How are you?

1236
02:36:32,030 --> 02:36:33,860
I... I'm okay, Aunty

1237
02:36:34,460 --> 02:36:38,360
He's gone to Kasauli. Give me
your number. I'll give it to him

1238
02:36:40,030 --> 02:36:42,030
No, it's okay.
I'll call him

1239
02:37:36,090 --> 02:37:36,850
How are you, son?

1240
02:37:40,890 --> 02:37:41,550
I'm okay, Dad

1241
02:37:44,030 --> 02:37:47,330
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

1242
02:37:48,670 --> 02:37:49,690
No, it's nothing like that

1243
02:37:51,110 --> 02:37:52,440
Been working all day...

1244
02:37:52,810 --> 02:37:53,600
I'm tired, that's all

1245
02:38:05,920 --> 02:38:07,550
Come back home, Akash

1246
02:38:36,380 --> 02:38:37,320
What's wrong, Akash?

1247
02:38:39,590 --> 02:38:41,490
I've never seen you like this
before

1248
02:38:42,690 --> 02:38:43,750
I'm in love, Dad

1249
02:38:46,930 --> 02:38:49,620
So what's the problem?

1250
02:38:51,160 --> 02:38:52,650
She is marrying somebody else

1251
02:38:56,870 --> 02:38:59,340
Have you told her you love her?

1252
02:39:01,480 --> 02:39:01,960
No

1253
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:04,910
Does she love you?

1254
02:39:09,350 --> 02:39:10,110
Yes, she does

1255
02:39:12,860 --> 02:39:13,980
Has she told you?

1256
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:24,690
Akash, you must tell her
how you feel

1257
02:39:27,340 --> 02:39:27,800
No

1258
02:39:28,610 --> 02:39:29,200
Why not?

1259
02:39:32,610 --> 02:39:34,040
She is marrying somebody else

1260
02:39:38,080 --> 02:39:42,380
There are many things in this world
that are beyond our understanding

1261
02:39:43,550 --> 02:39:45,380
When a person decides something...

1262
02:39:46,590 --> 02:39:49,720
...there must be a reason for that
decision

1263
02:39:50,860 --> 02:39:56,090
You say that the girl loves you
but is marrying someone else

1264
02:39:57,430 --> 02:40:01,730
Have you tried to find out
why she's doing it?

1265
02:40:04,210 --> 02:40:06,300
What's the reason for her decision?

1266
02:40:25,490 --> 02:40:26,430
How's Shalini?

1267
02:40:28,260 --> 02:40:28,990
She isn't happy

1268
02:40:31,130 --> 02:40:32,100
And how could she be?

1269
02:40:33,270 --> 02:40:36,240
She is marrying Rohit
but loves you

1270
02:40:40,410 --> 02:40:42,070
Did she tell you that?
- No

1271
02:40:44,410 --> 02:40:46,140
Did you ever tell me you love her?

1272
02:40:51,620 --> 02:40:53,380
Then why's she getting married?

1273
02:40:56,190 --> 02:40:58,680
Rohit's father and Shalini's father
were business partners

1274
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:05,930
Shalini was six when her parents
were killed in a car accident

1275
02:41:07,640 --> 02:41:12,540
I was her only relative but
I wasn't able to support her

1276
02:41:15,640 --> 02:41:16,870
Rohit's parents took her in...

1277
02:41:17,080 --> 02:41:17,640
...not only into their home

1278
02:41:17,850 --> 02:41:19,780
but their hearts and their life

1279
02:41:21,050 --> 02:41:22,540
They've done a lot for her

1280
02:41:23,650 --> 02:41:27,650
If they want her to marry Rohit,
Shalini can't refuse

1281
02:41:30,190 --> 02:41:31,420
What else can she do?

1282
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:36,760
On one hand are the people who've
given her the life she's living

1283
02:41:38,270 --> 02:41:39,200
On the other hand is a man...

1284
02:41:39,400 --> 02:41:42,100
She doesn't even know if he loves
her or not

1285
02:41:43,270 --> 02:41:47,940
Akash, what are you doing man!
Go and tell her you love her

1286
02:41:51,610 --> 02:41:53,580
Akash, only you know what
you have to do

1287
02:41:55,080 --> 02:41:57,210
Just know this. Tonight is
the Sangeet function...

1288
02:41:58,550 --> 02:41:59,750
...and tomorrow the wedding

1289
02:42:02,030 --> 02:42:04,890
Whatever your decision,
you must make it today

1290
02:44:19,790 --> 02:44:20,850
Will you marry me?

1291
02:44:30,340 --> 02:44:32,970
Not even if I tell you that
I love you?

1292
02:45:14,380 --> 02:45:14,940
Shalini...

1293
02:45:16,950 --> 02:45:19,010
I love you and only you

1294
02:45:21,560 --> 02:45:22,580
My every breath...

1295
02:45:24,260 --> 02:45:25,350
...every heartbeat...

1296
02:45:27,130 --> 02:45:29,720
...every moment,
is for you, Shalini

1297
02:45:32,570 --> 02:45:37,730
I'm sure that I was born
so that I could love you

1298
02:45:39,240 --> 02:45:41,870
And you were born to become mine

1299
02:45:43,180 --> 02:45:44,540
You are mine, Shalini

1300
02:45:45,610 --> 02:45:47,380
And if you ask your heart...

1301
02:45:48,520 --> 02:45:51,610
...you will know that I speak
the truth

1302
02:45:58,590 --> 02:46:01,220
What's going on! Who is this boy?

1303
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:02,390
I'll tell you

1304
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:07,300
He is Akash Malhotra,
A.K. Malhotra's son...

1305
02:46:07,970 --> 02:46:10,230
...who's been after Shalini,
wagging his tail

1306
02:46:11,210 --> 02:46:14,900
I hit him once but I guess
it wasn't enough, huh?

1307
02:46:15,980 --> 02:46:17,100
I won't leave you today!

1308
02:46:17,310 --> 02:46:22,550
You will do no such thing, Rohit.
I want to speak to Shalini first

1309
02:46:51,850 --> 02:46:54,610
No, Rohit! You wait here.
- But Dad! This is my life...

1310
02:48:13,400 --> 02:48:17,060
Mahesh, I feel very hurt today

1311
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:20,930
I always thought that Shalini was
my daughter

1312
02:48:21,840 --> 02:48:24,870
But today I feel that she has
never thought of us as her own

1313
02:48:27,110 --> 02:48:30,010
She wants to repay her debt to us
by marrying Rohit

1314
02:48:32,550 --> 02:48:33,040
All right

1315
02:48:36,420 --> 02:48:39,450
Shalini, you must repay us

1316
02:48:41,190 --> 02:48:44,890
For looking after you from
childhood till now... you owe us

1317
02:48:45,730 --> 02:48:48,560
For giving you whatever you
asked for... you owe us

1318
02:48:49,830 --> 02:48:52,770
For shielding you from
even a hint of trouble...

1319
02:48:52,870 --> 02:48:53,700
...you owe us

1320
02:48:55,770 --> 02:48:59,940
Now if you want to repay all that
you owe us... see us happy...

1321
02:49:02,910 --> 02:49:04,440
Then marry Akash

1322
02:49:11,260 --> 02:49:12,780
Can you do this much for me?

1323
02:49:32,940 --> 02:49:33,570
Come...

1324
02:49:44,920 --> 02:49:49,020
Take care of her.
She is my daughter

1325
02:50:24,560 --> 02:50:25,320
Just a minute, Dad

1326
02:50:27,700 --> 02:50:30,460
You can't do this! Mom, why
aren't you saying anything?

1327
02:50:31,100 --> 02:50:33,000
Let her go, Rohit

1328
02:50:36,310 --> 02:50:39,500
You care about Shalini's happiness
but don't give a damn about mine!

1329
02:50:39,810 --> 02:50:44,270
Rohit, if Shalini is not happy
being with you...

1330
02:50:44,920 --> 02:50:46,410
...how can you ever be happy?

1331
02:50:48,550 --> 02:50:49,710
This can't happen to me!

1332
02:50:53,460 --> 02:50:54,620
I won't allow this!

1333
02:50:58,030 --> 02:50:58,520
What are you doing?

1334
02:51:33,900 --> 02:51:35,520
I love Akash

1335
02:51:56,590 --> 02:51:57,820
All his life he said...

1336
02:51:58,120 --> 02:51:59,820
I won't say "I love you" to anyone

1337
02:52:00,260 --> 02:52:01,250
And when he had to say it...

1338
02:52:01,590 --> 02:52:04,460
It was at someone's wedding
in front of 300 people!

1339
02:52:08,770 --> 02:52:09,820
Did you call him?

1340
02:52:13,640 --> 02:52:14,470
What did he say?

1341
02:52:17,510 --> 02:52:18,500
He wasn't home

1342
02:52:24,180 --> 02:52:25,910
I told you he won't come

1343
02:54:19,300 --> 02:54:21,290
Can I talk to Sid?

1344
02:54:42,650 --> 02:54:43,420
How are you?

1345
02:54:45,220 --> 02:54:47,020
Fine. How are you?

1346
02:54:53,730 --> 02:54:54,890
Forgive me

1347
02:54:57,840 --> 02:54:59,360
I must apologise too

1348
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:04,440
Some other time.
It's my turn today

1349
02:55:06,910 --> 02:55:08,170
You haven't changed
at all

1350
02:55:09,010 --> 02:55:12,950
Ya. Anyway, it's hard to improve
on perfection

1351
02:55:19,260 --> 02:55:20,620
Where are you? When can we meet?

1352
02:55:22,090 --> 02:55:25,690
Today. Now. This very moment

1353
02:57:04,030 --> 02:57:08,160
Now... there's no pain...
nor any fear

1354
02:57:12,640 --> 02:57:14,130
I feel good

1355
02:57:16,540 --> 02:57:17,530
It's peaceful here

1356
02:57:22,150 --> 02:57:24,280
You're a good boy, Siddharth

1357
02:57:28,320 --> 02:57:30,020
You always stood by me

1358
02:57:34,690 --> 02:57:36,350
You want me to be happy,
don't you...

1359
02:57:40,270 --> 02:57:41,430
Then... you be happy

1360
02:57:44,270 --> 02:57:45,030
You will, won't you?

1361
02:57:45,410 --> 02:57:45,960
I will

1362
02:57:56,920 --> 02:57:58,350
Life is so strange

1363
02:58:00,590 --> 02:58:01,990
Some relationships...

1364
02:58:05,190 --> 02:58:06,820
...don't have any name

1365
02:58:13,630 --> 02:58:15,660
You and I will always...

1366
03:00:12,520 --> 03:00:15,210
Hey Sid, look at your ship

1367
03:00:16,520 --> 03:00:19,010
It was so small 2 years ago.
Look how much it's grown

1368
03:00:22,300 --> 03:00:25,290
If you guys wanted to be by
yourselves, you should've told us

1369
03:00:28,530 --> 03:00:31,260
See! I'm getting told off because
of you

1370
03:00:31,470 --> 03:00:32,460
I've been telling you, let's go

1371
03:00:32,740 --> 03:00:33,230
What?

1372
03:00:33,910 --> 03:00:34,800
Come on

1373
03:01:03,100 --> 03:01:03,900
Come on man
