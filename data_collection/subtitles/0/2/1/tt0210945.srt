1
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,065
In Virginia,

2
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,394
high school football is a way of life.

3
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,521
It's bigger than Christmas day.

4
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,857
My daddy coached in Alexandria.

5
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,401
He worked so hard, my mama left him,

6
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,861
but I stayed with Coach.

7
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,154
He needed me on that field.

8
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,576
Up until 1971 in Alexandria,

9
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,744
there was no race mixing.

10
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,830
Then the school board
forced us to integrate.

11
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,708
They combined the white school
and the black school into one

12
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,586
called T.C. Williams High School.

13
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:38,599
Murderer! Murderer!

14
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,309
That summer
a black teenager was killed

15
00:01:40,344 --> 00:01:42,276
by a white store owner,

16
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,855
and the city was
on the verge of exploding.

17
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:49,193
# Well, my mind
is goin' through some changes #

18
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,861
You've caused enough damage!

19
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,487
- This is my store!
- Back off.

20
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,449
Blue left! Blue left! Left!

21
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,203
Come on, Kurt, don't let Ray
back you down like that!

22
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,163
You're twice his size!

23
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,498
Aargh!
What are they doing?

24
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,792
If they keep playing like that,
we'll lose every game!

25
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,503
I didn't think that was so bad.

26
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,087
# She had to run #

27
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,759
Looks good, Gerry.
I can see you been working.

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,511
Thanks. Thanks a lot, Coach.

29
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,347
Listen, with the schools
integrating and all,

30
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,640
some of the guys are
worried about losing

31
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,058
their starting positions.

32
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,352
Well, that's something we're
just gonna have to figure out,

33
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,937
but you don't worry about that now.

34
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,397
You just keep at it.
All right?

35
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,690
Yes, Coach.

36
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,944
Hey, guys! Guys!

37
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,654
It's comin' down!

38
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,781
It's comin' down at the store!

39
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,823
They want to burn the place up

40
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,659
'cause that colored kid got shot.

41
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,244
Come on, man, let's go.

42
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,331
Hey. Hey!

43
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,792
Coach?

44
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,837
You just get Sheryl
to the school now, Herb.

45
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,255
# Sorry #

46
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,849
Get in the truck.

47
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,560
Gerry, Alan, Ray,

48
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,687
if you ever want
to play for me again,

49
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,814
get in the truck now.

50
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,817
You boys are gonna cool off,
come with me to my office,

51
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,318
help me finish packing my things.

52
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,445
Gerry, son, your heart's
in the right place,

53
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,530
but you ought to know better

54
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:17,865
than to embarrass the coach like that.

55
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,741
Hell, why don't you just
kick them all off the team?

56
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,577
I don't want to play with
any of those black animals.

57
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:22,543
Whoa.

58
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,162
I see him.

59
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,706
Who are you?

60
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,958
I'm Herman Boone. I'm
the new assistant coach.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,710
Well, from the looks of things,

62
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,005
I'd say we got all the help
we need around here.

63
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,423
Why ain't you outside there

64
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,842
with all your little friends, hollering'?

65
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,307
This was the time that
was arranged for me

66
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:45,642
to meet with Coach Yoast.

67
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,603
I never miss an appointment.

68
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,898
Well, maybe you just
better reschedule.

69
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,733
Coach Boone, the school
board made the decision

70
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,485
to put you on my staff.
I did not hire you.

71
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,614
Well, I came up here
to coach at G.W.

72
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,908
I didn't ask the schools
to redistrict.

73
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,618
I didn't ask to be
assigned to your staff,

74
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:04,077
so I guess we're both
in a situation

75
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,162
we don't want to be in.

76
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,581
But I can guarantee
you this, Coach,

77
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,750
I come to win.

78
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,753
Win? Coach Yoast
here has been nominated

79
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,172
to the Virginia
High School Hall of Fame.

80
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,508
15 winning seasons.

81
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,219
I won a couple of titles
down in North Carolina.

82
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,762
That's double "A" ball.

83
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,598
This here's Virginia.
We play triple "A."

84
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,893
What an opportunity
for me then...

85
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:32,105
to learn... from the best.

86
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:36,235
# Ooh, I bet
you're wonderin' how I knew #

87
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,195
Are those people the movers?

88
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,656
No. Looks like
they're moving in here.

89
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,824
How many of them are there?

90
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,409
It only takes one.

91
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,827
Then we're gonna be
overrun by 'em.

92
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,830
Mommy, where are you
taking my teddybear?

93
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,125
That. Come on, y'all.
Ohh.

94
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,211
Where is everybody?

95
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,129
Nicky, yes.

96
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,841
Look there, here
comes some more of 'em.

97
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,094
That's Dr. Day, that
Negro from the school board.

98
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,929
What's he doing here?

99
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,223
The school board has decided
that Negro Herman Boone

100
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,516
is gonna be
the head coach at T.C.

101
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,102
It's not fair!
My daddy's head coach!

102
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,979
This is gonna be
his Hall of Fame year!

103
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,438
No one is trying to takeaway

104
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,399
your daddy's future place in the hall.

105
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,277
You can't just walk in here
and take my daddy's job away!

106
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,530
That is enough, Sheryl.
That's enough.

107
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,410
Sheryl!

108
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,870
Ow.

109
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,329
I...

110
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:33,125
It's all right, Bill.
I feel the same way.

111
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,419
It's those agitators and race-mixers

112
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,337
I feel like taking a swat at.

113
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,881
Troublemakers in the Berg are ready

114
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,008
to put a torch to the city.

115
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,719
You want us to burn up like Watts?

116
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,304
Every head coach in the system is white.

117
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,146
We had to give them something.

118
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,893
It's the world we live in,
God help us all.

119
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:54,021
I left North Carolina
because I was passed over

120
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:56,023
for a job that I had rightfully earned.

121
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,900
Gave it to a white coach down there

122
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,776
couldn't even tie up
his own football cleats.

123
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,320
Now you are asking me

124
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,447
to do the same thing to this man?

125
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,740
I can't do that.

126
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,992
Herman?

127
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:11,747
Folks in Carolina say
you marched with Dr. King.

128
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,209
Say you stood toe-to-toe
with the Klan.

129
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:16,627
Said you're a race man.

130
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,629
That's right.
I'm also a family man.

131
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,465
Coach Boone, black folks
have never had

132
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,383
anything in this city
to call their own

133
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,594
except humiliation and despair.

134
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,054
Dr. Day, excuse me.

135
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,223
Herman, I think you'd
better look outside.

136
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,700
So, you see,
we need you, Coach Boone.

137
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,786
Come on, meet the people.

138
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,788
Coach Boone,
I'm Charles Campbell.

139
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,214
This here is my boy Julius.

140
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,834
He can be the finest defensive end

141
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,253
in the whole state
if you push him to it.

142
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,546
I've heard a lot about you.

143
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,130
You're like an answer
to our prayers.

144
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,091
Now, wait a minute. I'm not
an answer to your prayers.

145
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:08,095
I'm not a savior
or Jesus Christ,

146
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,805
Martin Luther King,
or the Easter bunny.

147
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,849
I'm a football coach, that's all.

148
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,225
Just a football coach.

149
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,393
You're our coach.

150
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,936
You're our coach!

151
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,563
Coach Boone!

152
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:26,989
Boone! Boone! Boone!

153
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,292
What do you want?

154
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,712
Is Coach Yoast here?

155
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:42,754
We're busy...

156
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,424
interviewing
for head coaching jobs.

157
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:49,136
Gotten 11 offers and
certainly no time for you.

158
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,149
Well, come on in.
I've got an office out back.

159
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:06,612
Look, I can't even spell diplomacy,

160
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,906
and I'm sorry about
the way things went down,

161
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,909
but make no mistake,
I am qualified

162
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:12,993
to be this school's head coach.

163
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:14,453
Sure. You've been in, what,

164
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,455
4 or 5 programs
in the past 10 years?

165
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,040
With 4 or 5 championships.

166
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,458
This isn't about me.

167
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,793
I'm worried about my boys.

168
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,922
Well, I ain't gonna
cook 'em and eat 'em.

169
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,633
The best player will play.
Color won't matter.

170
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,219
From the looks of our
little situation we got here,

171
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,221
I'd say it's about all that does.

172
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,931
Yeah, you're right.

173
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,349
We're in a tough spot, Coach,

174
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,059
you, me, the whole city.

175
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,353
I think it would go a long
way to smooth things over

176
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,647
if you would stay, work on the staff,

177
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,358
be a defensive coordinator,
assistant head coach.

178
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:47,319
Work under you?

179
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,197
If that's the way you see it.

180
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,327
Good night, Coach.

181
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,375
It's been a rare privilege

182
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,502
to have lived here as long as I have

183
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,670
coaching your boys.

184
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,964
I'll be taking the year off...

185
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:08,347
No.

186
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,677
after which
I'll be moving to Loudon

187
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,972
and taking the head coaching
job at Loudon High.

188
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:18,976
- I say boycott T.C. Williams!
- Tell 'em, Fred!

189
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,395
Our boys aren't playing
for some "Coach Coon!"

190
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,522
Coach, he stole your job.

191
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,274
I'm not playing for him.

192
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,568
I started a petition, and I'm
sitting this season out.

193
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:29,027
Only place you're going to sit

194
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:30,654
is back in that chair, Gerry.

195
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,114
I appreciate it, though.

196
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,700
Boycott T.C.!
Boycott the school!

197
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,411
Stop this, Fred.
You know none of these boys

198
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,413
can afford to go to some other district

199
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:40,455
just to play ball.

200
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,040
They sit this one out,

201
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,625
they put their futures on the line.

202
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,711
Coach, I'm out, too.

203
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,962
I'm not playing for no thief.

204
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,422
Don't do this.

205
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,716
Don't make this any harder
for me than it already is.

206
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,467
Coach, if you go, I go.

207
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,595
only play for you, Coach Yoast.

208
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,139
Don't go, Coach.
You can't leave us.

209
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,142
Coach Yoast!
Coach Yoast! Coach Yoast!

210
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,192
We'll be all right, Coach.

211
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,736
I've coached most of these boys

212
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,070
since they were your age.

213
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,655
I've seen them grow up
in front of my eyes,

214
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:16,158
almost like
they were my own kids.

215
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,367
Almost.

216
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,621
This is a heck of a time
to be abandoning them

217
00:10:20,656 --> 00:10:23,040
to look out for
themselves, ain't it?

218
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,335
So... what are you
gonna do?

219
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:30,797
We gonna play some ball, y'all!

220
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:33,342
Black inside, black inside,
black inside.

221
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,927
Unh, unh, unh, unh!

222
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,970
Yo, Petey,
how many yards you figure

223
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,388
you gonna get this season, bro?

224
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:40,474
You know, I ain't one
to brag, big Blue,

225
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:42,518
but I figure on
at least a thousand.

226
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:44,520
But I ain't one to brag.

227
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,063
Didn't I tell you all them white boys

228
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,356
weren't gonna play for no brother?

229
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,899
Well, who needs 'em, baby?

230
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:52,361
From now on the Titans gonna be
powered by soul power, bro.

231
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:56,532
# He said soul power #

232
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:58,909
Shut up.

233
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,131
Put your hand down.

234
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,132
You're smiling.

235
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,133
Yes.

236
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,511
Yes, sir.
Why are you smiling?

237
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:20,556
'Cause I love football.
Football's fun.

238
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,641
Fun, sir. It's fun?

239
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:23,642
- Yes.
- You sure?

240
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:24,643
I think-

241
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:25,651
Now you're thinking'.

242
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,312
First you smile,
then you thinking'.

243
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,981
You think football is still fun?

244
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,023
Uh, yes.

245
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,024
Sir.

246
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,985
- Yes-no, sir.
- No?

247
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,528
It was fun.

248
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,113
Not anymore, though, is it?

249
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,155
Not right now.

250
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,991
It's not fun anymore.
Not even a little bit.

251
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,576
Uh... no.

252
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,411
Make up your mind.
Think since you're thinking.

253
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,121
Go on, think.
Is it fun?

254
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,289
- No, sir.
- No?

255
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,290
Absolutely not?

256
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,416
Zero fun, sir.

257
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,418
All right, listen up.
I'm Coach Boone.

258
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,547
I'm gonna tell you all
about how much "fun"

259
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,757
you're gonna have this season.

260
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,969
We leave for camp,
Gettysburg College,

261
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:01,889
August 15th, 7:29 A.M.

262
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,689
If you report at 7:30,

263
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,475
you will not be playing
football this season,

264
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,019
you will be watching.

265
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,605
You will wear
a jacket, shirt, and tie.

266
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,064
If you don't have one, buy one.

267
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,483
Can't afford one,
borrow one from your old man.

268
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,569
If you don't have an old man,

269
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,447
then find a drunk, trade him for his.

270
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,324
'Cause I guarantee you
there isn't a bum on the street

271
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:21,867
that looks as raggedy
and ridiculous

272
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,327
as what I'm looking at right now.

273
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,370
This is no democracy.

274
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:28,373
It is a dictatorship.

275
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,883
I am the law.

276
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:35,631
If you survive camp,
you will be on the team.

277
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,051
If you survive.

278
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,302
Check 'em in, Coach.

279
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,929
Checkin' 'em in.

280
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,389
I'm Coach Hinds,
your offensive line coach.

281
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:46,767
Yell out your name and position
starting from the right.

282
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,519
Petey Jones, running back.

283
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,312
The running back, y'all.

284
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:51,396
Whatever, Petey.

285
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,898
Get out here!

286
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jerry Harris, quarterback.

287
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,655
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah, Rev!

288
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:00,614
Rev?

289
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:02,623
It's just a nickname.

290
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:05,661
And who in the name
of heaven might you be?

291
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,414
Louie Lastik, offensive lineman.

292
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,834
Naval family, just moved
here from Bayonne.

293
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,710
Someone said football,
so I come runnin'.

294
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,003
What's goin' on, everybody?

295
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,205
With him calling the shots,
ain't none of us

296
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,270
gonna see nothin'
but the bench this year.

297
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,814
He ain't calling the shots. You'll play.

298
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,448
You have just disrupted

299
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:44,992
my first team meeting

300
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:46,660
in an unacceptable fashion.

301
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,120
This is my team now.

302
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:49,538
Either you're with that
or you're not.

303
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,582
I'm here, ain't I?
Let's talk football.

304
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:52,708
Let's talk football.

305
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,334
I run the defense-

306
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:57,588
As a part of my team strategy.

307
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,590
Now, I have never seen
an assistant coach's name

308
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,425
in the newspaper for losing a game.

309
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,885
I want a job for Coach Tyrell.

310
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,428
He's been with me for 10 years.

311
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,263
I won't leave him out in the cold.

312
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:07,973
You don't get me without him.

313
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,559
You're overcooking
my grits, Coach.

314
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:16,440
All right. I will allow Coach Tyrell

315
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,900
to coach the special team,

316
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,985
but I will have my eye on him.

317
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,446
And you.

318
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,661
Good morning, good morning,
Coaches, how are you?

319
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,003
Good morning to you.

320
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:33,040
Looks good today, doesn't it?

321
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,501
Just wanted to let you know
what the offense is doing.

322
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,336
Awful skinny play book, ain't it?

323
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:41,465
I run 6 plays, split veer.
It's like novocaine.

324
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,217
Just give it time, always works.

325
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:44,301
See you on the bus.

326
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,679
Be patient, Bill.
Your time will come.

327
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,681
Herman, here we go.

328
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,350
Here we go.

329
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:55,938
How can I help you boys?

330
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,397
I'm Gerry Bertier,

331
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:00,234
the only all-American
you got on this team.

332
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:02,528
You want any of us to play for you,

333
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:03,987
you reserve half the open positions

334
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,322
for Hammond players,

335
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:07,241
half the offense,
half the special teams.

336
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,243
We don't need any of
your people on defense.

337
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,369
We're already set.

338
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,704
Uh-huh. Don't need
none of my people?

339
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:14,790
What did you say
your name was, Jerry?

340
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:16,124
Gerry.

341
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,044
No, you must have said
Jerry, like Lewis,

342
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,839
which would make you
Dean Martin, right?

343
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,716
Ladies and gentlemen,
I got an announcement to make.

344
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,719
We got Jerry Lewis
and Dean Martin

345
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,638
going to camp with us
here this year.

346
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,306
Jerry tells the jokes,

347
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,830
Dean sings the songs
and gets the girl.

348
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:36,270
Let's give them
a round of applause.

349
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,571
Where's your folks,
Gerry?

350
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,406
Your parents, are they here?

351
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,700
Where are they?

352
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,076
That's my mother.

353
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:52,411
That's your mama?

354
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,288
Very nice. How are you?

355
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:56,832
Take a good look at her.

356
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,292
'Cause once you get on that bus,

357
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,836
you ain't got no mama no more.

358
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,297
You got your brothers on the team,

359
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:04,840
and you got your daddy.

360
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,592
Now, you know who
your daddy is, don't you?

361
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:10,179
Gerry, if you want to play
on this football team,

362
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:15,350
you answer me when I ask you
who is your daddy.

363
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:18,020
Who's your daddy, Gerry?

364
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,354
Who's your daddy?

365
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:22,983
You.

366
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,444
Uh-huh. And whose team
is this?

367
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,907
Is this your team,
or is this your daddy's team?

368
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,450
Yours.

369
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,870
Mm-hmm. Get on the bus.

370
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:38,957
Put your jacket on first
and get on the bus.

371
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:39,958
OK.

372
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,087
Uh, Dean?

373
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,633
Fix that tie, son.

374
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:03,065
All right, listen up,
I want everybody off the bus.

375
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,526
Let's go. Follow me. Everybody.
Let's go right now.

376
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:06,777
Why we got to get off the bus?

377
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,403
What are they doing, man?

378
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,782
All right, everybody, off the bus.

379
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,242
Listen up, I don't care

380
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,494
if you're black, green,
blue, white, or orange,

381
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:18,121
I want all of my defensive
players on this side,

382
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:20,624
all players going out
for offense over here.

383
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,792
Right now.

384
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:24,253
Let's move! Let's move!
Let's move! Let's move!

385
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:27,548
You and you, offensive bus.
Sit together.

386
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:30,384
You and you, defensive bus.
Sit together.

387
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:31,927
Get comfortable, too,

388
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,388
because the person that
I have you sitting next to

389
00:17:34,423 --> 00:17:37,099
is the same one
you'll be rooming with

390
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,226
for the duration of this camp.

391
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,274
# 'Cause, baby #

392
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:49,862
# There ain't no mountain high enough #

393
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:53,532
# Ain't no valley low enough #

394
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,034
Blue, shut up.

395
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,870
I don't want to see
your smilin' and shuff in',

396
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:00,873
and hear all your minstrel
show singing on this bus.

397
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,958
You, too.

398
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,002
Got that right.

399
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:08,881
You can shut up, too.

400
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,734
# When I die
and they lay me to rest #

401
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,444
That's my bed.

402
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:33,739
# Gonna go to the place
that's the best #

403
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,450
# When I lay me down to die #

404
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:37,910
And that's his bed.

405
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,205
# Up to the spirit in the sky #

406
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,749
# Goin' up to the spirit in the sky #

407
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,459
I ain't lookin' at that
for 2 weeks, man.

408
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:46,877
Take it down.

409
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,170
# When I die #

410
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:51,173
You can close your eyes
for 2 weeks, all I care.

411
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:53,091
Why don't you look at your wall
and I'll look at mine?

412
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:54,600
I'll look wherever I want to,

413
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,929
and I don't want to be
looking at that for 2 weeks.

414
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,640
Then you better use your
X- ray vision, Superman,

415
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:02,100
and look right through it,
'cause it ain't comin' down.

416
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,192
Aah!

417
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:12,986
Fight!

418
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,821
Fight?

419
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:16,240
Fight!

420
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,241
Follow me!

421
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:18,408
Come on! Come on!

422
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:19,660
All right, wait up!

423
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,995
Get off me!
Get off me!

424
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,081
Get him off.

425
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,290
Get off me!

426
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:27,709
Bunch of tough guys, huh?

427
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:32,256
You look like a bunch
of fifth-grade sissies

428
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,383
after a cat fight.

429
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,385
You got anger. That's good.

430
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,262
You're gonna need it, son.

431
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,805
You got aggression.
That's even better.

432
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:41,098
You're gonna need that, too,

433
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:44,560
but any 2-year-old child
can throw a fit.

434
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:48,313
Football is about
controlling that anger.

435
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:51,400
Harnessing that aggression
into a team effort

436
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,735
to achieve perfection!

437
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:56,280
Some coaches, they cut a player

438
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:59,157
if they think he's not up to snuff.

439
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,702
When they think
he's hurting the team.

440
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,704
This is a public school program.

441
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:06,039
I will never, ever cut a player

442
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,624
who comes out to play for me,

443
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,043
but when you put that uniform on,

444
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:13,005
that Titan uniform,
you better come to work.

445
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,885
We will be perfect...

446
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,428
in every aspect of the game.

447
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,555
You drop a pass, you run a mile.

448
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,891
You miss a blocking assignment,
you run a mile.

449
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,601
You fumble the football,

450
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:30,480
and I will break my foot off
in your John Brown hind parts...

451
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:32,065
and then you will run a mile.

452
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,775
Perfection!

453
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:38,197
Let's go to work.

454
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,493
Move! Move those feet!

455
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:43,744
Get up, boy! Get up! Get up!

456
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:46,038
Get up! Get up! Get up!

457
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:49,291
Keep those heads up!

458
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,460
Keep those feet moving!

459
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:52,920
Everything we gonna do is changing.

460
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,720
We are change.

461
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,507
We're gonna change
the way we run.

462
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,467
We're gonna change
the way we eat.

463
00:20:58,502 --> 00:21:00,344
We're gonna change
the way we block.

464
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,763
We're gonna change
the way we tackle.

465
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,389
We're gonna change
the way we win.

466
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:06,642
Defense is desire!

467
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:07,684
Fire and desire.

468
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,478
Defense! Come on!

469
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:15,400
Get up. Get outta here.
Go run. Go.

470
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:21,747
Unh!

471
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,617
Keep those legs movin'!
Keep those legs apart!

472
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,118
Keep movin: keep movin'.

473
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:27,079
Keep that ball with you till
you get outta the briar patch.

474
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,540
Show me, son! Show me, 'Bama!

475
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:30,756
Show me, 'Bama!

476
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,793
Jump on that ball carrier
like a starving man

477
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:34,419
on a Christmas ham.

478
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:36,797
Hut!

479
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:40,676
Fumble! Fumble!

480
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,094
What is wrong with you?

481
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,303
Why are you fumbling
my football?

482
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:44,638
My blockers were bad.

483
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,639
Your blockers ain't got nothin'

484
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:47,307
to do with you holding the ball!

485
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:48,851
Did your blockers fumble the football,

486
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,435
or did you fumble the football?

487
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:51,520
I did, sir.

488
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:52,980
All right.
How many feet are in a mile?

489
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,857
How many feet are in a mile?

490
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,109
5,280 feet!

491
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,280
You pick this ball up,
you run every one of them!

492
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:04,616
You're killing me, Petey!
You're killing me!

493
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,587
What you doing, man?

494
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:19,590
Eating lunch.

495
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:21,550
I see you eating lunch.

496
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:23,552
But why you eating over here?

497
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:26,054
Why don't you go on over there
and eat with your people?

498
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,557
Man, I don't have any people.

499
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,982
I'm with everybody, Julius.

500
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,977
He's just a light-skinned brother.

501
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,605
Yeah, and I'm
a dark-skinned cracker.

502
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,608
Come on, Julius, he's
just another blessed child

503
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:40,027
in God's loving family.

504
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,198
Come on, Blue, let me-

505
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:50,913
Lord, we come before you today...

506
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,917
and ask you to soften
big Julius Campbell's heart.

507
00:22:54,952 --> 00:22:58,212
Look at that traitor.

508
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:00,631
And Rev?
He better be praying

509
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,925
I block for his black behind.

510
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,927
Yeah, but, Ray, if you don't block

511
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:06,595
you're not gonna start.

512
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:08,931
I'll start.

513
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,349
I'll just bide my time.

514
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,227
I got some plays we won
the city title with last year.

515
00:23:13,262 --> 00:23:16,522
Got some trick plays,
some stuff that might

516
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:19,650
fire up the boys'
imaginations a little bit.

517
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:21,610
Trick plays?

518
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:23,487
I think unless the boys
start having a little fun

519
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:25,531
they're not gonna put points
up on that board for you.

520
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:26,948
You worry about your defense.

521
00:23:26,983 --> 00:23:28,283
Let me worry about the offense.

522
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:31,829
All right.

523
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:33,705
Lastik!

524
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:42,714
I want you to tell me something

525
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,258
about one of your black teammates.

526
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:45,551
Sir, yes, sir!

527
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:47,010
I'm rooming with Blue, sir,

528
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:49,930
and I noticed he wears those
leopard-spotted under wears,

529
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:51,515
bikini-style, sir!

530
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:54,434
OK, maybe somebody
who's not your roommate.

531
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,395
Sir, I eat lunch with Rev.

532
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,272
That's Jerry Harris, sir!

533
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:00,274
People call him Rev
'cause he's always praying,

534
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:03,569
and he won't abide
a foul tongue, sir!

535
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,445
And what is the Rev gonna
do after high school?

536
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:06,989
I don't know.

537
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,283
Go to college and all that, I guess.

538
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:10,868
What about you?
You gonna go to college?

539
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:12,411
Oh, not me, Coach.

540
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,954
I ain't a brainiac like Rev.

541
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:15,539
Think you got a future in football?

542
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:18,584
Heck, no. I just figure
if I got to be in school

543
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,586
I might as well hit some
people while I'm at it.

544
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,421
All right, I like that.

545
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,131
A self-aware man, I like that.

546
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:26,425
But if you don't go to college,

547
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,552
it's not gonna be because
you're not qualified,

548
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:30,470
so I want you to bring me
your test scores

549
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:32,890
at the end of every week, and
we'll go over them together, OK?

550
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,850
We'll keep that between you and me.

551
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:36,018
OK.

552
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,771
So, what kind of music
does the Rev like?

553
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:41,440
Me and Rev both
dig on The Temptations.

554
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:42,566
Oh, yeah?

555
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:44,651
# I know you want to leave me #

556
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:48,739
# But I refuse to let you go #

557
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,741
# If I got to pray #

558
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:52,868
# Plead for your sympathy #

559
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,578
# I don't mind #

560
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,622
# 'Cause you mean
that much to me #

561
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,916
# Ain't too proud to beg #

562
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:00,918
OK, all right. Stop begging.

563
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:03,295
Anybody else?

564
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,925
No volunteers?

565
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:11,762
Campbell?

566
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:16,642
Bertier?

567
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,229
No, huh?

568
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:27,945
Each one of you
will spend time every day

569
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,697
with a teammate of
a different race.

570
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:33,367
You will learn
about him and his family,

571
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:34,952
his likes, his dislikes.

572
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:37,830
You will report back to me

573
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:40,666
until you meet every one
of your teammates.

574
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:44,378
Until that time,
we go to 3-a-day practices.

575
00:25:44,413 --> 00:25:46,839
You continue
to ignore each other,

576
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:49,258
we'll go to 4-a-day practices.

577
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,552
Now, is there any part of this
you don't understand?

578
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:54,680
Let's see.
What's your daddy's name?

579
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,682
I mean, you do have a daddy right?

580
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:59,852
I have a father, and his name is Eric.

581
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:01,812
And what's he do?

582
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:04,022
Wait, he does have a job, right?

583
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:08,735
They're gonna
put me in the movies!

584
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:13,157
Huh? Yes! This one.

585
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:15,576
I don't even have to ask,
but I will.

586
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,035
What do you think of this one?

587
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,038
Does the term "cruel
and unusual punishment"

588
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:21,832
mean anything to you?

589
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,710
2 minutes to go in the game.

590
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,420
The other team is out there,
they're tired.

591
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:28,130
Fourth quarter.
Fourth quarter.

592
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:30,007
Fourth quarter.

593
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:32,593
Nobody from my family
ever went to no college.

594
00:26:32,628 --> 00:26:33,635
I'll tutor you, Louie.

595
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,179
I'm white trash!

596
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:37,014
I ain't gonna get
no C-plus grades!

597
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:39,057
I'm just down-home, no-good,

598
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:42,060
never-goin'- to-no-college
white trash, man!

599
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:43,604
Would you hurry up
and get off the phone?

600
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:44,855
I got to call my girl, too, man!

601
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:46,190
Say it right now.

602
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:49,985
Oh, oh, don't do this right now.

603
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:52,196
Hey, man, what is this,
Wild Kingdom?

604
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:53,322
Shut up, y'all!

605
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:55,032
Mating habits of
the mountain gorillas?

606
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:57,201
Gerry, you say it, or I'm
not hanging up the phone.

607
00:26:57,284 --> 00:27:00,496
Say it right now.

608
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:01,914
I love you, sugar.

609
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,500
Ha ha ha!
"I love you, sugar!"

610
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:05,626
Left!

611
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:07,169
Let's go!

612
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:08,462
Watch it!
Watch it!

613
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:10,506
Set! Hut!

614
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:14,927
Get him!
Get him! Get him!

615
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,763
What are y'all doing?

616
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:20,599
44 stack! You're supposed
to know your jobs!

617
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:23,101
Campbell, you're playing
selfish, show-off football.

618
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:24,228
Hold your man down.

619
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:25,771
Don't you single me out like that.

620
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,314
What, you think
I'm stupid or something?

621
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:28,774
Listen,
I'm the team captain,

622
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:30,317
and I don't need you up in my face-

623
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:33,362
We're here to play football, y'all.

624
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:34,780
Let's play football.

625
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,824
Doc?

626
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:38,242
I got it.

627
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:39,993
Y'all didn't come
out here to practice!

628
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:42,371
'Cause champions pay the price!

629
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:44,790
Lookin' like a bunch of bums out here!

630
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:48,085
Who's a coward?
Cowards won't block.

631
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,254
Cowards won't tackle.

632
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,840
Cowards won't
go after fumbles.

633
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:54,383
Coach,
we need a water break.

634
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,384
We been out here all day.

635
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:58,512
What did you say?

636
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:00,138
I said we need a water break.

637
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:02,140
You need a water break.

638
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:05,227
Water is for cowards.
Water makes you weak.

639
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:07,563
Water is for washing
blood off that uniform,

640
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:09,565
and you don't get
no blood on my uniform.

641
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,317
Boy, you must be outside your mind!

642
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:14,862
We are going to do up-downs

643
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:18,615
until Blue is no longer
tired and thirsty.

644
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:30,878
Coach!

645
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,011
There's a fine line
between tough and crazy,

646
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:41,054
and you're firting
with it.

647
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,897
All right,
get some water.

648
00:28:49,932 --> 00:28:54,568
I'll take that.

649
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,445
Hey, wait your turn, boy.

650
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,738
Who you calling a boy, cracker?

651
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,574
Yaah!

652
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:02,910
Quit it, jerks!

653
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:05,871
Come on! You're all acting
like a bunch of sissies!

654
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,372
Quit it!

655
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:20,511
All right, man, listen.
I'm Gerry, you're Julius.

656
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:21,970
Let's get some particulars

657
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:23,514
and just get this over with, all right?

658
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:25,057
- Particulars?
- Yeah.

659
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:26,225
No matter what I tell you,

660
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:27,768
you ain't never gonna know
nothing about me.

661
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:30,938
Listen, I ain't runnin'
any more of these 3-a-days.

662
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,606
What I got to say,
you really don't want to hear

663
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:35,984
'cause honesty ain't too high
on your people's priority list.

664
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:37,945
Honesty?
You want honesty?

665
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:41,114
All right, honestly,
I think you're nothing.

666
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,616
Nothing but a pure waste

667
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:44,368
of God-given talent.

668
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:46,370
You don't listen to nobody, man.

669
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:48,413
Not even Doc or Boone!

670
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,374
Shiver push on the line
every time, man.

671
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:52,709
You blow right past 'em!

672
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:56,255
Push 'em!
Pull 'em! Do something!

673
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:58,257
You can't run over
everybody in this league,

674
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:00,801
and every time you do, you
leave one of your teammates

675
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:02,719
hanging out to dry-
me in particular!

676
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:05,973
Why should I give a hoot
about you, huh?

677
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:07,850
Or anybody else out there?

678
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:09,643
You want to talk about a waste,
you the captain?

679
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:10,727
Right.

680
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:12,729
- Captain's supposed to be the leader,
right? - Right.

681
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:14,523
You got a job? You
been doing your job?

682
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:15,858
I've been doing my job.

683
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:17,943
Then why don't you tell
your white buddies

684
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:19,862
to block for Rev better?
'Cause they have not blocked

685
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:22,156
for him worth a plugged nickel,
and you know it!

686
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:26,451
Nobody plays!
Yourself included!

687
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:29,288
I'm supposed to wear
myself out for the team?

688
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,582
What team?!

689
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:34,334
No. No, what I'm gonna do is,

690
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:36,336
I'm gonna look out for myself,

691
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,713
and I'm gonna get mine.

692
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,632
See, man?

693
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:42,968
That's the worst attitude
I ever heard.

694
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:47,973
Attitude refects
leadership, Captain.

695
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:01,486
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

696
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:03,572
Wake up, gentlemen,
it's late.

697
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:05,908
It's 3 A.M. In the morning.

698
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:07,951
All right, listen up.

699
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:11,455
You will follow Doc, myself,
and the other coaches,

700
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:13,499
we're gonna take a little
run through the woods.

701
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:15,751
If you get lost along the way,

702
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,920
don't bother coming back to camp.

703
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:20,047
Just hitchhike
your hind parts on home.

704
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,465
Any questions?

705
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:23,342
Coach, this is a high
school football team.

706
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:26,762
We're not in the marines here.

707
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:30,182
Let's go.

708
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:39,650
# Tell me, where have you been #

709
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:41,944
# My blue-eyed son? #

710
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,988
# Where have you been #

711
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:47,825
# My darlin' young one? #

712
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:52,079
# I've stumbled up on the side #

713
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:55,374
# Of 12 misty mountains #

714
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,626
# I've walked and I've crawled #

715
00:31:57,668 --> 00:32:00,087
# Over 6 broken highways #

716
00:32:00,122 --> 00:32:02,673
# But it's hard #

717
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:05,551
# It's hard #

718
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:06,802
Oh, no, no. Shoot!

719
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:09,388
Come on, baby.
Can't take no rest.

720
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,265
# Oh, it's hard, girl #

721
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:14,101
# It's a hard rain #

722
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:17,980
# Gonna fall #

723
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:27,281
Anybody know what this place is?

724
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:33,245
This is Gettysburg.

725
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:36,748
This is where they fought
the Battle of Gettysburg.

726
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:42,780
50,000 men died right here
on this field,

727
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:46,008
fightin' the same fight

728
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,760
that we're still fightin'
amongst ourselves...

729
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:51,889
today.

730
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:53,891
This green field right here

731
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,601
was painted red.

732
00:32:55,726 --> 00:33:00,189
Bubbling with the blood
of young boys.

733
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:01,982
Smoke...

734
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:08,447
and hot lead pouring
right through their bodies.

735
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:12,868
Listen to their souls, men.

736
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,955
"I killed my brother
with malice in my heart. "

737
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:23,012
"Hatred destroyed my family. "

738
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:26,048
You listen...

739
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:31,053
and you take a lesson from the dead.

740
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:36,642
If we don't come together...

741
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:40,687
right now,
on this hallowed ground...

742
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:42,898
then we, too, will be destroyed.

743
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:47,361
Just like they were.

744
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:51,198
I don't care if you
like each other or not,

745
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,534
but you will respect each other,

746
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:54,535
and maybe...

747
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,788
I don't know, maybe we'll...

748
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:02,709
learn to play this game like men.

749
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:03,961
Hut!

750
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:08,674
Here we go!

751
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:11,134
All right.

752
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,847
We'll be out here all night,
until we get this thing right.

753
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,014
Let's go.

754
00:34:16,098 --> 00:34:17,266
Let's go,
team, pick it up!

755
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:18,392
On the ball, Rev.

756
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:19,685
Come on, everybody.

757
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,019
Get it right!

758
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:23,105
Ready!

759
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,835
Set!

760
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,441
Whoo!

761
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:27,568
Check blue!

762
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:28,986
There it is. Whoo!

763
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:30,237
Let's go! Hut!

764
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:35,534
Get him!
Get him! Get him!

765
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:39,997
What was that, Ray?

766
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:41,456
Whatever it is, it ain't blockin'!

767
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:42,541
Give me a break, Gerry.

768
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:43,876
You want a break?
I'll give you a break!

769
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,252
Wait a minute, wait, wait.

770
00:34:45,294 --> 00:34:46,295
Let them handle this.

771
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:47,880
If we get to Rev once,
just one time,

772
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:49,423
Is wear to God,
I'm gonna hit you so hard,

773
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:50,716
by the time you come to,

774
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:52,050
ooh, boy, you're gonna
need a new haircut.

775
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:54,469
You understand me? Uhh!

776
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:55,554
Ha ha ha ha!

777
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:57,139
Let's play, fellas!

778
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:01,185
On the ball.
Let's run it again.

779
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:05,731
Ready!

780
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,065
All right.

781
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:08,066
Muskrat!

782
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,736
Set! Hut!

783
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:19,036
Get off me!

784
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:20,078
Hoo hoo!

785
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:21,455
You all right, big Petey?

786
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,421
You all right?

787
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:24,082
You really stuck him, Campbell.

788
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,084
Yeah, I love me
a little contact, Petey!

789
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:28,921
This is left side!

790
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:36,094
- Strong side!
- Left side!

791
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:37,304
Strong side!

792
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:38,305
Left side!

793
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:39,932
- Strong side!
- Left side!

794
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:40,933
Strong side!

795
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:45,938
- Aah!
- Aah!

796
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:49,650
What wins games?

797
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:50,776
Defense!

798
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:55,823
- What wins games?
- Defense!

799
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:02,287
# I was once out strolling #

800
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:06,500
# One very hot summer's day #

801
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:10,420
# When I thought I'd
lay myself down to rest #

802
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:11,797
Hey, fellas.

803
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,965
Look at that fruitcake.

804
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:15,801
Gerry, just keep your mouth shut

805
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:17,386
and get back on that field.

806
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:19,096
Coach Boone, I'm Colonel Bass.

807
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:20,430
I just got transferred here

808
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:21,849
from Huntington Beach, California.

809
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:23,684
This is my son Ronnie,
and he's a quarterback.

810
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:26,103
How you doing, Ronnie?
This is Coach Yoast.

811
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:27,271
My pleasure.

812
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:29,314
We're pretty set at the,
uh, quarterback, Colonel,

813
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:31,149
but, uh, if the boy's any good,

814
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:33,694
you may want to check out
Wilson or Hamilton.

815
00:36:33,729 --> 00:36:35,828
Well, I, uh, I met Coach Taber.

816
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,698
He won't let
blacks play on his team.

817
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:38,991
The way I see it,

818
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:40,868
if these boys can
fight a war together,

819
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:41,994
they can play football together.

820
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:43,871
Now, he's a pretty good runner.

821
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:46,582
# Spill the wine and take that pearl #

822
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:52,171
# Spill the wine and take that pearl #

823
00:36:52,254 --> 00:36:53,714
Yeah, a fruitcake, huh?

824
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,551
I think we can find
a place for your boy.

825
00:36:57,593 --> 00:36:58,552
Mm-hmm.

826
00:36:58,594 --> 00:37:00,721
With one or two conditions.

827
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:06,268
Hey, Sunshine.

828
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,562
# Sunshine #

829
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:11,023
Sunshine.

830
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:12,608
Hey, man, all that rubbin'

831
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:14,026
ain't gonna make them golden locks

832
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:17,029
grow back no faster now.
You know that, huh?

833
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:21,575
# Sunshine, Sunshine, Sunshine #

834
00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:22,618
Sunshine, huh?

835
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:23,619
Sunshine.

836
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,038
Yeah.
Choke it up, huh?

837
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,624
That's cool. I can dig it.

838
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:29,625
Ooh!

839
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:30,876
Come on, now.

840
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:33,045
Don't leave me hangin bro. Come on.

841
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:34,755
Hey, he got a little soul power.

842
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,673
Look at this man here.

843
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:39,301
He called me "bro"!

844
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:40,344
Hey, but, hey,

845
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:42,304
I liked him better
with the long hair, bro.

846
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:44,598
Reminded me of Bertier's mama.

847
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,682
Ohh!

848
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:47,309
What? What?

849
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:49,895
Now, how do you know
what Bertier's mama looks like?

850
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:52,648
Brother, don't you know
me and Bertier's mama

851
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:55,067
went out on the town
last night, bro?

852
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:56,360
What are you say-

853
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:58,195
Hold up, hold up.
Listen, now, Blue.

854
00:37:58,237 --> 00:37:59,780
Why are you talking about
Bertier's mama like that?

855
00:37:59,822 --> 00:38:01,490
See, now, you
making me angry, man.

856
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:03,534
Look like I ain't gonna
be able to take your mama

857
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:05,244
to the prom no more.

858
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:06,620
What you laughin' at, Jerry Buck?

859
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:07,955
You need to tell your mama

860
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,540
to shave them old legs
of hers, bro.

861
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:10,958
And, Julius, when she's done,

862
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:12,668
maybe your mama
can borrow the razor

863
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:15,921
and shave that old
nasty back of hers.

864
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:18,257
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait.

865
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:20,384
You mad because she
lookin' like a wolf man woman.

866
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:24,388
Hey, hey. Lastik, man,
what happened to you?

867
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:26,682
Man, I just gave your
mama a piggyback ride,

868
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:29,726
and she weighs twice
as much as I do.

869
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:32,312
That ain't funny.

870
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:35,107
That's-that's a mama joke.

871
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:43,615
# Listen, baby #

872
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:45,534
# Ain't no mountain high #

873
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:47,536
# Ain't no valley low #

874
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:51,123
# Ain't no river wide enough, baby #

875
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,458
# If you need me, call me #

876
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:55,294
# No matter where you are #

877
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:57,254
# No matter how far #

878
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:58,881
# No, no, darlin' #

879
00:38:58,964 --> 00:39:00,549
# Just call my name #

880
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:02,718
# I'll be there in a hurry #

881
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:04,428
# You don't have to worry #

882
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:05,971
# 'Cause, baby, there #

883
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:07,306
# Ain't no mountain high enough #

884
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:08,974
So, Julius, I was thinking that we-

885
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:10,434
He's in the shower.

886
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:12,477
# Ain't no mountain low enough #

887
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:14,021
What do you want, man?

888
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:17,482
You know what I want.

889
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:19,610
Ohh!

890
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:21,028
Ohh!

891
00:39:21,063 --> 00:39:22,321
Come on!

892
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:23,996
# I told you #

893
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:26,658
# You could always count on me #

894
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:28,577
Ooh! Ooh!

895
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,582
Hey, Bertier!

896
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:35,042
Get off. Get off.

897
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,211
You have no idea
who you messed with, man!

898
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:38,462
There's too much male bonding

899
00:39:38,504 --> 00:39:39,796
going on in here for me.

900
00:39:39,922 --> 00:39:41,048
I'm out. You dig?

901
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,014
All right!

902
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,800
What is going on here?

903
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:45,969
# Ain't no river wide enough #

904
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:47,513
He kissed me, man!

905
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:49,515
# To keep me from getting
to you, babe #

906
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,519
# 'Cause baby there #

907
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:55,938
# Ain't no mountain high enough #

908
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:59,983
# Ain't no valley low enough #

909
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:03,695
# Ain't no river wide enough #

910
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:06,365
# To keep me from gettin'
to you, babe #

911
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:07,699
- Ronnie Bass.
- Yes, sir.

912
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:09,076
I like that haircut.
Get in there

913
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:10,536
and show me what
you got. Option left.

914
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,371
Let's go, baby.
Rookie quarterback.

915
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,081
Side field, come on.

916
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:15,374
Left! Left!

917
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,669
Set! Hut!

918
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:22,381
Ball! Ball! Ball!

919
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:24,716
Hard step.

920
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,009
Read the tackle.

921
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:27,553
Got to see the pitch, all right?

922
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:28,971
Now, you can throw it a mile,

923
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:30,931
but you can't pitch it 3 yards.

924
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:31,974
Gotta see it.

925
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:33,976
If you don't read it,
you weave 'em.

926
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:34,935
- Rev!
- Yes, sir!

927
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:35,936
Show him how.

928
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:36,937
Yes, sir.

929
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,277
You want this milk, Bertier?

930
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:44,736
Yeah, I'll take it, man.

931
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:45,737
You can have it.

932
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:47,573
Hey, can you slide a bit, Gerry?

933
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:50,284
Hey, Ray, this is the defensive table.

934
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,412
# To get bread from dough #

935
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:54,997
Hi, Petey.

936
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:56,456
What's up, man?

937
00:40:56,582 --> 00:40:59,293
Hey, Sunshine.

938
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:00,752
It's not like I care or nothin',

939
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:03,589
but bein' your roommate and all, uh...

940
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,174
you was just messin'
with Bertier, right?

941
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,593
You-you was just messing
with his mind, right?

942
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:08,594
You're not really, uh...

943
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,430
What are you talking about, Petey?

944
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:12,723
Look, man, it don't
matter to me, you know?

945
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:14,600
I- if, you know, if...

946
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,435
I just got to know,
you know? Uh...

947
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,605
If it don't matter,
what's the big deal?

948
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,481
I got to know.

949
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:22,774
Know what?

950
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,444
You know what I got to know?
Don't mess with my mind!

951
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:26,778
Looks like Coach
been keeping Petey

952
00:41:26,862 --> 00:41:28,447
out in the sun for too long, bro.

953
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:30,289
Coach.

954
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:32,951
Hey, sweetie.
Sit down.

955
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:34,328
Have my dessert.

956
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:36,205
Coach Boone?

957
00:41:36,288 --> 00:41:38,499
You did a good job up here.

958
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:41,627
You ran a tough
camp from what I can see.

959
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:43,670
Well, I'm very happy
to have the approval

960
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,172
of a 5-year-old.

961
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:48,634
I'm 9 1/2, thank you very much.

962
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,302
Why don't you get this little girl

963
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:52,054
some pretty dolls
or something, Coach?

964
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,056
I tried. She loves football.

965
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,349
What are you?!

966
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:58,685
Mo-bile! A-gile!
Hos-tile!

967
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:00,229
What is pain?!

968
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:01,647
French bread!

969
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:02,898
What is fatigue?!

970
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,358
Army clothes!

971
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:07,694
Will you ever quit?!

972
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:08,695
No!

973
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:11,240
We want some mo'!
We want some mo'!

974
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:12,699
We want some mo'!

975
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:14,535
Turn in!

976
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:24,795
Let me ask you something,
Mr. Campbell.

977
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:25,796
Uh-huh.

978
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:27,256
What kind of power you got?

979
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:29,967
Oh, man, you know
I got some soul power.

980
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:31,552
What kind of power you got?

981
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:32,678
What kind of question is that?

982
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,012
I got soul power!

983
00:42:34,096 --> 00:42:35,521
- Yes, you do!
- Right on!

984
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:37,432
Let me ask you something
now, Mr. Bertier.

985
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:38,725
How strong are you?

986
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:39,852
I'm too strong!

987
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:41,687
- What?!
- I'm too strong!

988
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,981
- How strong?
- Too strong!

989
00:42:44,106 --> 00:42:45,440
I want a victory!

990
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:46,608
Oh, I want a victory!

991
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:47,693
I want a victory!

992
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:48,861
No, I want a victory!

993
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:50,028
You all want a victory?!

994
00:42:50,112 --> 00:42:51,029
Yeah!

995
00:42:51,113 --> 00:42:52,239
You all want a victory?!

996
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:54,867
Yeah!

997
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:01,290
# Good-bye #

998
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:03,584
# Na na na na #

999
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:05,711
# Hey, hey, hey #

1000
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:06,879
# Good-bye #

1001
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:08,046
Let me hear you!

1002
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:09,256
Let me hear you!

1003
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:11,008
Up in the front!
Up in the front!

1004
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:12,176
Whole school!

1005
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:13,343
# Hey, hey, hey #

1006
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,888
What'd they do up there,
brainwash 'em?

1007
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:17,723
They must be high on somethin'.

1008
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:20,559
# Na na na na #

1009
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:21,894
# Hey, hey, hey #

1010
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:23,353
Hey, Mom.

1011
00:43:23,437 --> 00:43:25,063
Oh, welcome home.

1012
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:26,732
Dad. Ah, ha ha.

1013
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:28,734
Mmm-ah! How you doin',
sweetheart?

1014
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:30,027
Oh, I missed you so much.

1015
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:32,738
Hey, man.
Like, are we cool?

1016
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:34,364
Yeah, we're cool, man.

1017
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:35,365
Mrs. Boone,
nice to meet you.

1018
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:36,366
You, too.

1019
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,285
Yeah, this is, uh, little Karen.

1020
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:40,037
This is Nicky.
Nicky, that's Sheryl.

1021
00:43:40,162 --> 00:43:42,206
Why do you dress so weird?

1022
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:44,791
Ow!

1023
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:46,752
Look who's talking.

1024
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:48,670
Ow.

1025
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:51,089
Well, we're just all
getting along, aren't we?

1026
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:52,508
We don't want you!

1027
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:55,511
Get out!

1028
00:43:57,804 --> 00:43:59,473
We don't want them here!

1029
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:01,391
# Time has come today #

1030
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:06,104
# Young hearts can go their way #

1031
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:10,275
# Can't put it off another day #

1032
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:12,569
What you doin' to my school, boy?

1033
00:44:12,604 --> 00:44:14,780
Man, this stuff is messed up.

1034
00:44:14,822 --> 00:44:16,073
Yeah,
anything serious happen,

1035
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:17,623
they shut the school down,

1036
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:19,535
and our season go down the drain.

1037
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:21,537
This here's real messed up.

1038
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,623
But there are a lot
of pretty women here.

1039
00:44:24,665 --> 00:44:27,376
Hey.

1040
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:28,961
Look at 'em, Gerry.

1041
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:31,296
They hate us.

1042
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:36,009
Nah. Just a bad day.
Things'll cool down.

1043
00:44:36,093 --> 00:44:38,220
No, Gerry. They're
always gonna hate us.

1044
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,391
We don't need you here,
either, hippie boy.

1045
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:44,685
You hear what he said?

1046
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:47,145
Hey, man.

1047
00:44:47,271 --> 00:44:48,272
Hey, Julius.

1048
00:44:48,313 --> 00:44:50,566
Man, it's crazy out here, man.

1049
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:52,568
Yeah, well, what did you expect?

1050
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:55,863
I don't know. I ain't quite
expect it to be like this.

1051
00:44:55,946 --> 00:44:59,408
Ah, sorry. Julius, this is Emma.

1052
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:06,707
# Now the time has come #

1053
00:45:06,742 --> 00:45:08,584
# Time #

1054
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:11,170
Camp over now, huh?

1055
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:14,131
Back to the real world, Bertier.

1056
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:16,717
This is what
they're integrating us for?

1057
00:45:16,842 --> 00:45:19,761
We'd have been better off
staying where we were.

1058
00:45:22,181 --> 00:45:23,348
# Time #

1059
00:45:26,185 --> 00:45:27,352
# Time #

1060
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,025
Mmm.

1061
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:36,570
Yeah, this is
my sanctuary right here.

1062
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:41,033
All this hatred and turmoil
swirling around us,

1063
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:43,911
but this...
this is always right.

1064
00:45:44,036 --> 00:45:46,079
Struggle.

1065
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:48,207
Survival.

1066
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:49,917
Victory and defeat.

1067
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:56,048
It's just a game, Doc,
but...

1068
00:45:58,383 --> 00:45:59,635
I love it.

1069
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:06,517
Coach, I'm afraid I've put you
into a no-win situation.

1070
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:08,310
I just found out the board
didn't even think

1071
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:09,707
you'd make it out of camp.

1072
00:46:09,742 --> 00:46:11,063
And now that you have,

1073
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:13,357
I've learned that
at the first sign of trouble-

1074
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:14,775
Trouble?
What kind of trouble?

1075
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:17,069
Lose a game...

1076
00:46:17,194 --> 00:46:18,403
they'll fire you

1077
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:20,781
and turn it back over to Yoast.

1078
00:46:20,823 --> 00:46:23,075
One game, just like that?

1079
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:24,243
Mm-hmm.

1080
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:25,911
What about my family?

1081
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:26,919
We just got here.

1082
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:28,497
They just expect me
to pick up and move?

1083
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:29,790
What about my girls?

1084
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:33,085
I- I don't know what to say, I...

1085
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:35,796
I'm sorry, Coach.

1086
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:39,383
# Pump, pump, pump it up #

1087
00:46:39,508 --> 00:46:41,426
# Pump that Titan spirit up #

1088
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:42,970
Look at 'em.

1089
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:44,012
They come here to watch the game,

1090
00:46:44,096 --> 00:46:47,015
and they still don't want no part of us.

1091
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:00,946
# Give us more #

1092
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:02,865
# Do your stuff, let's go #

1093
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,583
All right,
everybody on their feet.

1094
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,585
On your feet, on your feet.
Let's go, let's go.

1095
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:17,970
Listen up.

1096
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:19,715
I'm not gonna talk
to you tonight about...

1097
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:22,593
winnin' and losin'.

1098
00:47:22,718 --> 00:47:25,429
You're already winners,

1099
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:27,472
'cause you didn't
kill each other up at camp.

1100
00:47:27,598 --> 00:47:31,984
Tonight, we got Hayfield.

1101
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:33,604
Like all the other schools
in this conference,

1102
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:35,022
they're all white.

1103
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:38,609
They don't have
to worry about race.

1104
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:40,486
We do.

1105
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:44,323
But we're better for it, men.

1106
00:47:44,448 --> 00:47:47,618
Let me tell you something.
You don't let anything...

1107
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:49,661
nothin'...

1108
00:47:49,745 --> 00:47:51,170
come between us.

1109
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:53,040
Nothin' tears us apart.

1110
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:54,333
Greek mythology,

1111
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:57,628
the titans were greater
even than the gods.

1112
00:47:57,753 --> 00:48:00,214
They ruled their universe
with absolute power.

1113
00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:02,049
Well, that football field
out there tonight,

1114
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:04,016
that's our universe.

1115
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:06,595
Let's rule it like titans.

1116
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:07,930
Got it!

1117
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:15,771
So the Titans defense

1118
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,523
takes the field for the first time

1119
00:48:17,606 --> 00:48:19,066
against the Hayfield Hawks,

1120
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:20,901
led by quarterback
Daniel Cullum

1121
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:23,362
on the Hawks 32-yardline.

1122
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:24,655
Ohh!

1123
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:28,242
We're moving like molasses
out there,

1124
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:29,535
for crying out loud!

1125
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,203
I mean, come on!

1126
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:33,372
Uhh! Ooh!

1127
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:34,957
Mama.

1128
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:36,375
Hmm?

1129
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,669
Are all white girls that crazy?

1130
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:39,962
What?

1131
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:42,381
You guys can do
better than that-uhh!

1132
00:48:42,506 --> 00:48:43,924
Yeah!

1133
00:48:43,966 --> 00:48:46,093
Huddle up.
Fellas, huddle up.

1134
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:47,553
Bosley? Where's Alan?

1135
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:49,555
Alan, you've got to stick your man!

1136
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,390
They're gonna score on us
all night if you don't-

1137
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:52,683
He's too fast, Gerry.
I can't stick with him.

1138
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:54,643
Let's go, let's go!

1139
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:56,270
22! Hut!

1140
00:49:01,692 --> 00:49:03,110
Touchdown, Hawks!

1141
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:10,868
Shape up that defense, Yoast.

1142
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:12,119
You just worry
about your offense.

1143
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:14,288
Hey, they score again,
I'm takin' over.

1144
00:49:19,585 --> 00:49:20,836
Ready!

1145
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:22,129
That's it!

1146
00:49:22,171 --> 00:49:23,422
Watch him!
Watch him!

1147
00:49:23,547 --> 00:49:24,464
Set!

1148
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:27,301
Hut! Hut!

1149
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:35,058
Petey, get over here!
What are you doing, son?

1150
00:49:35,184 --> 00:49:36,977
You missed the block
by a mile.

1151
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:39,313
You didn't even have the
football to fumble this time.

1152
00:49:39,438 --> 00:49:41,315
There's no excuse!
No excuse!

1153
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:42,774
You want to play football or not?

1154
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,943
Do you want to play football-

1155
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:46,320
Boy, get over there
on the bench?

1156
00:49:48,864 --> 00:49:51,033
Herb, take over for me.

1157
00:49:51,074 --> 00:49:52,291
You got it.

1158
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:55,621
Petey!
You all right?

1159
00:49:55,662 --> 00:49:58,332
I was a 2-year starter at G.W.

1160
00:49:58,373 --> 00:49:59,958
All this yelling he's doing,

1161
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:02,169
it-it don't do nothing
but make me play worse.

1162
00:50:02,211 --> 00:50:03,504
I can't play for this man.

1163
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:05,297
You come play
linebacker for me.

1164
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:07,966
23's killing us. I want
you to get out there,

1165
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:09,676
I want you
to cover him for me.

1166
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,803
- You want me to go in now?
- Yeah.

1167
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:13,805
I can't! I-I...

1168
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:15,766
I haven't practiced
with the defense. I can't.

1169
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:17,601
That doesn't matter.
Just get out there.

1170
00:50:17,643 --> 00:50:19,353
I want you to cover 23.
That's all you have to do.

1171
00:50:19,478 --> 00:50:20,938
We'll talk about theres to fit

1172
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:22,481
when we put this one away.

1173
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:25,526
You think Yoast is trying to
let them score on purpose?

1174
00:50:25,561 --> 00:50:26,544
What?

1175
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:27,493
Do you?

1176
00:50:27,528 --> 00:50:28,821
Oh, come on, Herman.

1177
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:30,197
OK, let's go.

1178
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:34,785
What is Petey doing in there?

1179
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:41,834
Looks like Yoast
is trying him out on defense.

1180
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:43,961
He's taking Alan out.
Yoast!

1181
00:50:44,086 --> 00:50:45,671
Herman, Herman, Herman.

1182
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:48,090
Come on. Let's see.
Let's see what happens.

1183
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:49,383
It might be all right.

1184
00:50:49,424 --> 00:50:52,135
It's OK. You're OK.
You're OK. OK.

1185
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:53,804
Don't you take out my son!

1186
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:56,390
He's gettin' beat like he
stole somethin', Mr. Bosley.

1187
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:58,100
You just stay out of it, girl!

1188
00:50:58,225 --> 00:50:59,560
He's just getting beat,
that's all I'm saying.

1189
00:50:59,595 --> 00:51:00,686
Yoast!

1190
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:04,857
Set! 22! Hut hut!

1191
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:14,324
- Yeah!
- Ha!

1192
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:15,576
Down!

1193
00:51:15,617 --> 00:51:17,953
# Ah, yeah #

1194
00:51:17,988 --> 00:51:20,289
Hut! Hut, hut!

1195
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:24,585
# Doo doo doot doot doot #

1196
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,878
# Higher #

1197
00:51:25,961 --> 00:51:27,004
# Doo doo doot #

1198
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:28,338
# Doo doo doot #

1199
00:51:28,422 --> 00:51:31,258
# Doo doo doot doot doot #

1200
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,885
# La oohhoo #

1201
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:36,180
Go, Defense.

1202
00:51:36,305 --> 00:51:38,056
# Drummer, keep it going #

1203
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:39,057
Set!

1204
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:41,018
Hut!

1205
00:51:41,143 --> 00:51:42,728
# Right on time #

1206
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:44,438
# Blow my mind #

1207
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:46,565
# Higher #

1208
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:48,734
# Higher #

1209
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:49,735
# Superstar #

1210
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:56,200
Yeah! Uhh!

1211
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:01,914
Touchdown!
Game, Titans!

1212
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:03,582
Yeah!

1213
00:52:03,624 --> 00:52:06,460
The Titans are here, y'all,
and we ain't goin' nowhere.

1214
00:52:06,502 --> 00:52:08,212
Yo, you got to be loud
all the time, man?

1215
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:09,505
Virginia
can hear you, baby.

1216
00:52:09,588 --> 00:52:10,964
I think they all heard
you fumble, man.

1217
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:13,926
First of all, the hand.
Second of all, who won the game?

1218
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:14,927
My dad is-

1219
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:16,386
Don't worry about it.
It's not your fault.

1220
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:18,055
They-they like to show off,

1221
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,306
and that's what they do.

1222
00:52:19,348 --> 00:52:20,641
Wait, wait, wait.
"They"?

1223
00:52:20,676 --> 00:52:21,767
Yeah. What?

1224
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:23,060
I heard you say "they. "

1225
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:24,978
Yeah, they. Them.
Them over there.

1226
00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:26,814
But what you mean by "they"-
you talking about Pete-

1227
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:28,941
You're you, and they are them.

1228
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:31,944
Gerry.

1229
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:35,364
Hey, Gerry.
Hop in, buddy.

1230
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:37,658
We're heading over
to the hill, Gerry.

1231
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:39,117
Everyone's gonna be there.

1232
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:41,286
Why don't you hang out
down here with us?

1233
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,287
We're, you know.

1234
00:52:42,371 --> 00:52:45,249
What are you trying
to do, Gerry?

1235
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,959
Listen, when
something unexpected comes,

1236
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,962
you just got to pick it up
and run with it.

1237
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:53,966
I'm not running in the same
direction as you are, Gerry.

1238
00:52:54,091 --> 00:52:55,801
Come with us.

1239
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:59,680
Look, standing up
for what you believe in,

1240
00:52:59,715 --> 00:53:01,640
it's all well and good, but...

1241
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:05,644
you got your priorities
real mixed up this time.

1242
00:53:05,686 --> 00:53:08,689
Are you comin' or not, man?

1243
00:53:08,724 --> 00:53:11,657
# The way you stole my heart #

1244
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:15,404
# You know, you could have
been a cool crook #

1245
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:19,158
# And, baby, you're so smart #

1246
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:21,994
# You know, you could have
been a schoolbook #

1247
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:25,539
Petey Jones.

1248
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:26,540
Come on, man.

1249
00:53:26,582 --> 00:53:27,708
No, man.

1250
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:30,169
What, man? It's on me, man.
We party on. Let's go.

1251
00:53:30,252 --> 00:53:32,296
Look-look here, man, all right?

1252
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:34,339
This here's Virginia. All right?

1253
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:36,341
They got problems with,
you know-

1254
00:53:36,425 --> 00:53:38,051
They don't want us in there, man.

1255
00:53:38,177 --> 00:53:40,596
Oh, man, that's history, bro.
It's on me. Come on.

1256
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:46,310
# So lonely #

1257
00:53:46,435 --> 00:53:51,607
# Without you #

1258
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:53,192
# But our love #

1259
00:53:53,275 --> 00:53:55,027
We're full tonight, boys.

1260
00:53:55,152 --> 00:53:57,779
What? There's tables
all over the place, man.

1261
00:53:57,905 --> 00:53:59,490
What are you talking about?

1262
00:53:59,615 --> 00:54:01,492
Well, this is my establishment.

1263
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:04,661
I reserve the right
to refuse service to anybody.

1264
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:07,331
Yeah, that means
you, too, hippie boy.

1265
00:54:07,456 --> 00:54:08,790
Now, y'all want somethin' to eat,

1266
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:10,292
you can take these boys out back

1267
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:12,211
and pick it up from the kitchen.

1268
00:54:12,294 --> 00:54:13,587
What'd I tell you, man?

1269
00:54:13,629 --> 00:54:15,005
Yo, come on, Petey, man!

1270
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,381
Petey,
I didn't know, man.

1271
00:54:16,465 --> 00:54:18,509
I told you! What you
mean you didn't know?!

1272
00:54:18,592 --> 00:54:19,760
You think I was
playing with you?!

1273
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:21,178
Man, he didn't know,
Petey.

1274
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,679
Blue, he don't want to know.

1275
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:25,307
You pull some crap like that,

1276
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:26,600
you better be able to back it up.

1277
00:54:26,642 --> 00:54:27,900
Man, let's go, man.

1278
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:29,478
Why don't you
cool out? Cool out!

1279
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,646
Let's go, Rev.

1280
00:54:30,687 --> 00:54:33,065
Man, let's go, man.

1281
00:54:33,106 --> 00:54:34,066
What happened?

1282
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:36,360
This man acting
a fool tonight, man.

1283
00:54:36,485 --> 00:54:37,402
Petey.

1284
00:54:37,528 --> 00:54:38,946
Man, don't even talk
to that man, man.

1285
00:54:38,987 --> 00:54:40,781
He acting all crazy
and stuff, man.

1286
00:54:40,816 --> 00:54:42,074
It don't even make no sense.

1287
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:43,367
Petey.

1288
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:45,077
He know the man's
from out of town.

1289
00:54:47,246 --> 00:54:49,373
5 times-5 times,
player of the week.

1290
00:54:49,498 --> 00:54:51,917
He's not some
walk-on scrub, Yoast.

1291
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:54,086
The boy's a player.
He's a star.

1292
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:55,712
And he busted his butt for you.

1293
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:57,798
This is all your doing, you blacks.

1294
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,925
That is enough.

1295
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:01,426
It's my call.

1296
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:02,719
Now listen.

1297
00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:05,097
You just go on home now, Fred,

1298
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:07,558
before you do something
that you're going to regret.

1299
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,692
Yeah, well...

1300
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:18,235
I guess we won't be seeing
much of him, huh?

1301
00:55:18,277 --> 00:55:19,736
I will.

1302
00:55:19,862 --> 00:55:21,405
He's on the deacon
board with me.

1303
00:55:24,283 --> 00:55:26,410
All right,
listen, about Petey...

1304
00:55:26,535 --> 00:55:28,120
no thanks required, Coach.

1305
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:30,873
Thanks?

1306
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:33,709
You challenged my authority

1307
00:55:33,834 --> 00:55:36,065
in front of the entire
football team, Coach.

1308
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,297
Now, you think you're
doing these boys a favor

1309
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:40,883
taking them aside everytime
I come down on them,

1310
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:44,845
protecting them
from big bad Boone.

1311
00:55:44,887 --> 00:55:46,889
You're cutting my legs
from under me.

1312
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:49,266
Some of the boys
just don't respond well

1313
00:55:49,308 --> 00:55:50,642
to public criticism.

1314
00:55:50,726 --> 00:55:52,060
I tell them
what they need to know,

1315
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:53,896
but I don't humiliate them

1316
00:55:54,021 --> 00:55:56,648
in front of the team.

1317
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:58,317
Which boys are you
talking about?

1318
00:56:00,277 --> 00:56:01,653
Which ones you talking about?

1319
00:56:01,737 --> 00:56:03,780
I come down on Bertier.
I don't see you coddle him.

1320
00:56:05,574 --> 00:56:06,867
Come down on Sunshine.

1321
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:09,661
Don't see you grab his hand,
take him off to the side.

1322
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:12,956
Which boys
are you talking about?

1323
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,042
Now, I may be a mean cuss,

1324
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:16,627
but I'm the same mean cuss

1325
00:56:16,752 --> 00:56:20,047
with everybody out there
on that football field.

1326
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:21,048
The world don't give a damn

1327
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:22,382
about how sensitive
these kids are-

1328
00:56:22,508 --> 00:56:24,927
Especially the young black kids.

1329
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,930
You ain't doing these kids a favor

1330
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:29,473
by patronizing them.

1331
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,644
You're crippling them.

1332
00:56:33,769 --> 00:56:36,063
You're crippling them for life.

1333
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,361
Hey.

1334
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:46,782
Gerry, what are you doing?

1335
00:56:46,907 --> 00:56:48,784
I'm going down to the Berg.

1336
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:49,785
The Berg?

1337
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:50,786
Yep.

1338
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:53,247
What are you doing at the Berg?

1339
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:55,249
I'm going to play
basketball with Julius.

1340
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:56,542
Then we're going to
comeback here for dinner.

1341
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,919
Gerry, if your father
was still alive-

1342
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:00,546
Ma, would-

1343
00:57:00,629 --> 00:57:02,923
Just give him a chance.
Just get to know him.

1344
00:57:02,965 --> 00:57:04,132
Listen to him
for 2 seconds.

1345
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:06,677
I don't want
to get to know him.

1346
00:57:08,637 --> 00:57:10,973
You are coming to church
with your mother.

1347
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,394
Right, right, right!

1348
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,562
He's mine!

1349
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:17,563
Hut!

1350
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:24,945
You blew your assignment!

1351
00:57:24,987 --> 00:57:26,738
Man, I'm covering for you.
Don't get in my face.

1352
00:57:26,822 --> 00:57:28,866
Yo, cool out.
Cool out.

1353
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:30,993
Where you at?

1354
00:57:31,118 --> 00:57:32,452
What planet you on tonight?

1355
00:57:32,578 --> 00:57:34,705
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1356
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:35,873
I mean, it's fine, man.

1357
00:57:35,956 --> 00:57:36,957
I knew you was going
to stand me up.

1358
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:38,041
I figured you weren't
going to make out

1359
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:39,126
to the Berg, no way.

1360
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:40,169
I knew you was all talk,

1361
00:57:40,252 --> 00:57:41,170
but now you making us look bad

1362
00:57:41,253 --> 00:57:42,171
out there on the field.

1363
00:57:42,254 --> 00:57:43,881
Don't talk to me, man.

1364
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:45,257
You ain't got nothing
to say to me.

1365
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:47,593
Why the clouds, Sunshine?

1366
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:49,303
I can't make that pitch, Petey.

1367
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:51,471
You ain't gonna
never play anyway,

1368
00:57:51,597 --> 00:57:54,016
unless we're up by 50 points.

1369
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:55,184
And seeing as how
we ain't never gonna be

1370
00:57:55,267 --> 00:57:56,268
up by no 50 points,

1371
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,187
you might as well
just sit back, relax,

1372
00:57:58,312 --> 00:57:59,605
and enjoy the bench.

1373
00:57:59,646 --> 00:58:01,273
How's it going, yo?

1374
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:03,775
Man, I didn't sign up to play like this.

1375
00:58:03,859 --> 00:58:05,611
These guys we're playing
got no heart.

1376
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:07,321
We play like this against Groveton,

1377
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:08,572
we're going down.

1378
00:58:08,614 --> 00:58:10,782
OK, Offense.
Offense, let's go.

1379
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:15,204
Hut!

1380
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:21,084
Touchdown, Titans!

1381
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:22,920
Game, Titans!

1382
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:32,930
How you doing, Coach?

1383
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:34,806
Good morning.

1384
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:35,807
Where's your dad?

1385
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:36,934
He's in his office.

1386
00:58:36,975 --> 00:58:38,352
Nicky, you all right?

1387
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:40,062
Yes, Daddy.

1388
00:58:40,103 --> 00:58:41,063
OK.

1389
00:58:41,188 --> 00:58:42,606
What you doing?

1390
00:58:42,648 --> 00:58:45,526
Shooting some hoops.

1391
00:58:45,651 --> 00:58:47,110
Want to play?

1392
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:55,244
I just did my nails.

1393
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,248
How you doing?
Tyrell.

1394
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:00,999
Coach-ahem-
if you don't need me,

1395
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:02,251
I'm going to-

1396
00:59:02,376 --> 00:59:03,710
I'm going to wait out back.

1397
00:59:03,836 --> 00:59:04,711
All right, Herb.

1398
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:08,382
Coach Boone, to what
do I owe this surprise?

1399
00:59:08,507 --> 00:59:09,675
Have a seat.

1400
00:59:11,718 --> 00:59:13,095
I'll get straight to it.

1401
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,555
We won't survive another game

1402
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,014
like the one we played
last Friday,

1403
00:59:16,098 --> 00:59:19,101
so I spoke to Mr. Vernon
the math teacher,

1404
00:59:19,143 --> 00:59:21,854
asked him to look at
the game film from Groveton,

1405
00:59:21,937 --> 00:59:23,856
who we got next week.

1406
00:59:23,981 --> 00:59:26,859
I asked him to analyze it for me.

1407
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:28,986
Every coach has certain tendencies-

1408
00:59:30,404 --> 00:59:32,239
All of them except Ed Henry.

1409
00:59:32,281 --> 00:59:34,158
The only time
we'd be seeing Ed Henry

1410
00:59:34,283 --> 00:59:35,993
is at the state championship.

1411
00:59:36,034 --> 00:59:37,578
Mm-hmm.

1412
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:45,711
Well, gosh, this is...

1413
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:47,296
this is great stuff-

1414
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:49,715
Every quarter broken down,

1415
00:59:49,756 --> 00:59:51,717
how many times they run
each play. I mean-

1416
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:54,178
You like that, huh?

1417
00:59:54,303 --> 00:59:57,055
We'll be very tough
defensively with this.

1418
00:59:57,181 --> 00:59:58,599
I think so.

1419
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:01,935
I brought Nicky by.

1420
01:00:02,019 --> 01:00:03,479
She was asking me about Sheryl.

1421
01:00:03,604 --> 01:00:04,605
I'm getting ready to take her over

1422
01:00:04,646 --> 01:00:06,732
to some of her friends' house.

1423
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:08,650
Anytime you want to
bring her by the house,

1424
01:00:08,734 --> 01:00:10,444
we'd be more than
happy to have her.

1425
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:29,213
Oh, he's so cute.

1426
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:31,757
He's in my third period class.

1427
01:00:33,926 --> 01:00:36,929
What y'all staring at old Sunshine for?

1428
01:00:37,054 --> 01:00:38,639
I'm the one dominating
on the field.

1429
01:00:38,764 --> 01:00:39,973
He ain't played a minute all year.

1430
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:41,732
Who cares about the field?

1431
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:43,769
Well, I don't want to be
the one to break your heart,

1432
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:45,479
but Sunshine's from California.

1433
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:47,481
Yeah. A California dreamboat.

1434
01:00:47,523 --> 01:00:49,066
No.

1435
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:51,652
Sunshine is from California.

1436
01:00:51,687 --> 01:00:53,529
He's a Californian-

1437
01:00:53,612 --> 01:00:55,072
You talking to my girl?

1438
01:00:55,113 --> 01:00:57,491
I don't see any
livestock around here,

1439
01:00:57,533 --> 01:01:00,369
so I don't know what
you talkin' 'bout.

1440
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,787
Ohh.

1441
01:01:03,205 --> 01:01:04,081
It's a fight!

1442
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:05,207
Guys, stop it!

1443
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:06,708
Get off me. Get off me.

1444
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:07,960
Hey!

1445
01:01:09,419 --> 01:01:10,420
You want some?

1446
01:01:10,546 --> 01:01:12,297
Hey, hey, break it up.

1447
01:01:12,381 --> 01:01:13,799
Break-

1448
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:14,967
Get your hands off me, man!

1449
01:01:15,002 --> 01:01:16,927
Hey, get off me!

1450
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:18,011
Come here, man.

1451
01:01:18,095 --> 01:01:20,264
Aah!

1452
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:22,850
Petey, get these girls
out of here.

1453
01:01:22,933 --> 01:01:24,852
Get out of here!

1454
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:25,853
Uncle Tom traitor!

1455
01:01:25,936 --> 01:01:26,854
Uncle Tom!

1456
01:01:26,979 --> 01:01:28,689
I know you didn't call me
no Uncle Tom.

1457
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,524
Y'all better
back off me now, man.

1458
01:01:30,566 --> 01:01:31,824
Go! Move!

1459
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:32,825
Looks like you went to the zoo

1460
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,987
and made some
new friends, Bertier.

1461
01:01:35,028 --> 01:01:38,866
Oh, big smart guy, huh?

1462
01:01:38,949 --> 01:01:40,159
# Ah #

1463
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:46,190
# Ahah #

1464
01:01:46,331 --> 01:01:47,099
# Ah #

1465
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:48,876
# Ahah #

1466
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:50,460
Marie has asked about Sheryl.

1467
01:01:50,586 --> 01:01:52,004
Wanted to know if she could
come over and spend the night.

1468
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:54,006
I told her I'd run it by you,
see what you thought.

1469
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:55,549
Yeah.

1470
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:56,717
She's over
at the Boones' tonight.

1471
01:01:56,842 --> 01:01:58,427
I was going to swing by

1472
01:01:58,552 --> 01:01:59,887
on my way home
and pick her up.

1473
01:01:59,922 --> 01:02:02,181
Over at the Boones', huh?

1474
01:02:02,264 --> 01:02:03,432
Yeah.

1475
01:02:06,768 --> 01:02:09,605
So that's the way it is, huh?

1476
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:10,772
Yeah, you haven't changed a bit.

1477
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:12,566
You was the one trying
to please everybody,

1478
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:14,193
be the nice guy.

1479
01:02:14,276 --> 01:02:17,196
Sooner or later,
a man's got to pick sides.

1480
01:02:18,489 --> 01:02:21,283
As for me, well, I'm-
I'm not going to put myself...

1481
01:02:21,325 --> 01:02:23,327
through the rest of the
season with that uppity... - Hey.

1482
01:02:23,452 --> 01:02:25,746
I brought you here.

1483
01:02:25,787 --> 01:02:28,290
I want you with me,

1484
01:02:28,332 --> 01:02:30,375
but you got to do
what you got to do.

1485
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:36,507
That's all you can say to me

1486
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:38,050
after all we've been through?

1487
01:02:38,175 --> 01:02:39,051
Do what you got to do?

1488
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:40,177
Hey, Herb-

1489
01:02:40,219 --> 01:02:41,220
You go to hell.

1490
01:02:52,231 --> 01:02:53,607
That veer's getting better.

1491
01:02:53,649 --> 01:02:55,234
I'll admit that.

1492
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:56,777
But you're still weak
on the left side.

1493
01:02:56,902 --> 01:02:58,362
We're not weak on the left side.

1494
01:02:58,403 --> 01:03:00,948
We just got to work harder
on the left side, that's all.

1495
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:02,699
- That's not the problem.
- What is the problem?

1496
01:03:02,783 --> 01:03:04,618
You think it is, but it ain't.
It's your pass reads.

1497
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:06,203
It's not-
It's a run anyway.

1498
01:03:06,245 --> 01:03:07,621
It's not a pass.
The veer is a run.

1499
01:03:07,663 --> 01:03:09,832
All right, you two,
that's enough of that.

1500
01:03:09,957 --> 01:03:13,252
Sheryl, don't you want
to play with Nicky?

1501
01:03:13,293 --> 01:03:16,088
I hate playing with dolls.

1502
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:18,632
I'm not playing.
I'm accessorizing.

1503
01:03:18,674 --> 01:03:19,842
Yeah, why don't you
go accessorize?

1504
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:22,386
Don't you want to go
accessorize with-

1505
01:03:24,847 --> 01:03:26,682
Hey, "Coach Coon!"

1506
01:03:29,268 --> 01:03:31,937
In the back.
In the back.

1507
01:03:31,979 --> 01:03:33,939
Mommy!

1508
01:03:56,295 --> 01:03:57,421
Where's Coach, man?

1509
01:03:57,462 --> 01:03:58,422
What do he want with us now?

1510
01:03:58,547 --> 01:04:00,132
Coaches ain't called
this meeting tonight.

1511
01:04:00,174 --> 01:04:01,133
We did.

1512
01:04:01,175 --> 01:04:02,467
We outta here.

1513
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:04,303
Hey, how y'all gonna
walk out on your teammate?

1514
01:04:04,344 --> 01:04:05,304
He say he got
something to say.

1515
01:04:05,345 --> 01:04:06,305
Y'all got to listen to him.

1516
01:04:06,346 --> 01:04:07,598
Turn around,
turn around.

1517
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:09,183
Where you going?
Turn around.

1518
01:04:09,266 --> 01:04:11,185
Coach Boone brought us
this far, y'all,

1519
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:14,062
but he ain't going to be
there for us forever, man.

1520
01:04:14,188 --> 01:04:16,732
So what?
We won a few games.

1521
01:04:16,857 --> 01:04:19,776
And y'all fools
think that's something?

1522
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,612
Man, that ain't nothing, y'all.

1523
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:23,155
And you know what else?

1524
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:25,324
We ain't nothing, either.

1525
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:28,577
Yeah, we came together
in camp. Cool.

1526
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:29,870
But then
we're right back here,

1527
01:04:29,912 --> 01:04:31,295
and the world tells us

1528
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:32,956
that they don't want us
to be together.

1529
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,500
We fall apart

1530
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:37,169
like we ain't a damn bit
of nothing, man.

1531
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:39,338
And y'all think
we done won something?

1532
01:04:39,379 --> 01:04:41,882
Man, we ain't won
nothing, y'all-

1533
01:04:41,924 --> 01:04:43,759
Nothing.

1534
01:04:43,884 --> 01:04:45,031
Rev, what's that you're always

1535
01:04:45,066 --> 01:04:46,178
telling me when I get sick

1536
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:48,972
of trying to keep up
with my grades and stuff?

1537
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:51,350
# Even youths #

1538
01:04:51,475 --> 01:04:53,393
# Grow tired and weary #

1539
01:04:54,812 --> 01:04:57,189
# Even young men stumble and fall #

1540
01:04:57,231 --> 01:04:59,691
# But those who trust in the Lord #

1541
01:04:59,775 --> 01:05:02,820
# Will renew their strength #

1542
01:05:02,945 --> 01:05:04,363
Say amen.

1543
01:05:04,404 --> 01:05:06,240
Amen. That's what
I'm talking about.

1544
01:05:06,365 --> 01:05:08,075
Amen-amen, right?

1545
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:09,368
That's right, Rev.

1546
01:05:09,409 --> 01:05:10,619
# They will soar #

1547
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:12,704
# On wings like eagles #

1548
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:14,832
# Oh, like eagles, y'all #

1549
01:05:14,957 --> 01:05:16,708
# Like eagles, y'all #

1550
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:18,418
# They will walk #

1551
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:21,004
# And not grow faint #

1552
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:23,674
Yeah. Can I get an amen?

1553
01:05:23,799 --> 01:05:25,259
Yeah!

1554
01:05:26,802 --> 01:05:29,221
Yeah.

1555
01:05:30,848 --> 01:05:34,560
We're playing Groveton
Friday night, y'all.

1556
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:36,854
You all gonna play like
you ain't got no heart?

1557
01:05:36,937 --> 01:05:38,105
No!

1558
01:05:38,147 --> 01:05:39,523
Do you all want a victory?

1559
01:05:39,565 --> 01:05:40,566
Yeah!

1560
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,109
Do you all want a victory?

1561
01:05:42,144 --> 01:05:43,235
Yeah!

1562
01:05:43,277 --> 01:05:44,278
Turn in!

1563
01:05:48,574 --> 01:05:49,449
Yeah!

1564
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:53,287
Like I said,

1565
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:54,705
we will not be intimidated.

1566
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:56,331
We're going to play
football games.

1567
01:05:56,415 --> 01:05:59,168
Hatred, violence
will not intimidate us.

1568
01:05:59,251 --> 01:06:00,169
Is that why you need

1569
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:01,336
the state troopers, Coach?

1570
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:03,589
Look, I don't need no
John Brown state troopers.

1571
01:06:03,624 --> 01:06:04,840
And you can tell whoever
threw this brick

1572
01:06:04,882 --> 01:06:05,883
through my window

1573
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:07,426
they can come visit me anytime.

1574
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:08,427
I'll be at home.

1575
01:06:08,468 --> 01:06:09,720
I think it's time you stopped

1576
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:11,972
antagonizing everybody and
learned a little humility.

1577
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:13,140
Humility, huh?

1578
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:15,559
You know, if you could
just keep your mouth shut

1579
01:06:15,601 --> 01:06:17,269
and if you didn't brag so much-

1580
01:06:17,304 --> 01:06:18,937
I see.
So you're blaming me

1581
01:06:19,021 --> 01:06:20,063
for what happened last night?

1582
01:06:20,189 --> 01:06:22,608
No. I am talking about
setting a good example

1583
01:06:22,733 --> 01:06:24,443
for our boys
and for the community.

1584
01:06:24,485 --> 01:06:26,320
I don't scratch my head
unless it itches,

1585
01:06:26,361 --> 01:06:28,322
and I don't dance unless
I hear some music.

1586
01:06:28,363 --> 01:06:30,741
I will not be intimidated.
That's just the way it is.

1587
01:06:30,866 --> 01:06:32,367
If you want to carry
your sinful pride with you

1588
01:06:32,451 --> 01:06:33,952
to your grave,
that's your business,

1589
01:06:34,036 --> 01:06:36,205
But when your sins
endanger my little girl,

1590
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:37,915
it becomes mine.

1591
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:39,298
My sins?

1592
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:41,335
You think my sins
had something to do

1593
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:42,920
with what happened last night?

1594
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:44,796
I'm sorry about what
happened to your daughter,

1595
01:06:44,922 --> 01:06:46,215
I really am,

1596
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,674
but may be you got a small taste

1597
01:06:47,758 --> 01:06:49,468
of what my girls go through.

1598
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:51,178
Hmm?

1599
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,347
Welcome to my life, Yoast.

1600
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:55,891
Shh, shh!

1601
01:07:01,522 --> 01:07:03,774
What's going on?

1602
01:07:03,816 --> 01:07:04,900
Coach.

1603
01:07:07,236 --> 01:07:08,904
Uh, we wanted to let you know

1604
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:09,905
we was going to warm up

1605
01:07:09,947 --> 01:07:12,115
a little different tonight.

1606
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:14,701
This is the first
true test of the season

1607
01:07:14,785 --> 01:07:16,703
for the undefeated T.C. Williams Titans,

1608
01:07:16,787 --> 01:07:18,664
'cause tonight, they're going up against

1609
01:07:18,699 --> 01:07:21,542
the undefeated Groveton Lions.

1610
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:23,961
Their all-state nose guard, Kip Tyler

1611
01:07:24,002 --> 01:07:26,380
is as mean as a copper head snake.

1612
01:07:26,415 --> 01:07:27,381
Raah!

1613
01:07:27,422 --> 01:07:31,218
And here come the Titans.

1614
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,846
They're playing in front
of a capacity crowd

1615
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:35,973
for the first time this season.

1616
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:37,391
# Ha, real good #

1617
01:07:37,432 --> 01:07:38,851
# Hoo, ha, we feel #

1618
01:07:38,934 --> 01:07:40,602
# Hoo, ha, real good #

1619
01:07:40,637 --> 01:07:42,271
# Hoo, ha, we feel #

1620
01:07:42,312 --> 01:07:44,231
# Hoo, ha, real good #

1621
01:07:44,273 --> 01:07:45,983
# Hoo, ha, we feel #

1622
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:47,526
# Hoo, ha, real good #

1623
01:07:47,568 --> 01:07:49,298
# Hoo, ha, we feel #

1624
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:51,029
# Hoo, ha, real good #

1625
01:07:51,113 --> 01:07:53,615
# Hoo, ha, we feel #

1626
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:55,242
Julius Campbell

1627
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:56,326
is playing strong side linebacker.

1628
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:57,327
Sheryl.

1629
01:07:57,411 --> 01:07:58,328
He's so good.
He's got all-American-

1630
01:07:58,412 --> 01:07:59,872
Sheryl.

1631
01:07:59,955 --> 01:08:02,624
- And Gerry Bertier-
- Sheryl.

1632
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:06,128
I do not care.

1633
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:08,005
5, 6!

1634
01:08:08,046 --> 01:08:10,048
5, 6, 7, 8!

1635
01:08:10,174 --> 01:08:14,052
# Everywhere we go #

1636
01:08:14,136 --> 01:08:17,723
# People wanna know #

1637
01:08:17,848 --> 01:08:20,058
# Who we are #

1638
01:08:20,184 --> 01:08:22,060
# Who we are #

1639
01:08:22,144 --> 01:08:26,190
# So we tell them #

1640
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:30,068
# We are the Titans #

1641
01:08:30,194 --> 01:08:34,072
# The mighty, mighty Titans #

1642
01:08:34,156 --> 01:08:37,743
# Ooh, ah, oh, yeah #

1643
01:08:37,868 --> 01:08:40,579
Who do they think they are,
the Beatles?

1644
01:08:40,621 --> 01:08:42,080
# Ooh, ah, oh, yeah #

1645
01:08:42,164 --> 01:08:44,625
All right, quit gawking.
Warm up.

1646
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:45,751
Tyler.

1647
01:08:45,876 --> 01:08:47,211
Coach?

1648
01:08:47,294 --> 01:08:49,087
Shut 'em up-hard.

1649
01:08:53,926 --> 01:08:55,219
Ready!

1650
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:58,388
Omaha, Budds, omaha.

1651
01:08:58,514 --> 01:08:59,473
Set!

1652
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:00,474
Omaha!

1653
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:02,768
Hike!

1654
01:09:07,272 --> 01:09:09,233
Song's over, Sambo.

1655
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:14,780
Ohh.

1656
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:18,624
Yo, man.

1657
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:21,119
Let's go, baby.
Let's go, let's go.

1658
01:09:22,955 --> 01:09:24,414
What happened, Lastik?

1659
01:09:24,498 --> 01:09:25,707
I- I audibled.

1660
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:27,376
Rev, I swear to God I audibled.

1661
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:29,127
- All right, fellas, coming through.
- I didn't hear it.

1662
01:09:29,253 --> 01:09:30,504
Swear to God.

1663
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:31,505
Let's take a look at that, son.

1664
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:33,799
Uhh.

1665
01:09:33,841 --> 01:09:34,967
Well, he broke a bone in the wrist.

1666
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:36,510
He won't be throwing
anymore this season.

1667
01:09:36,552 --> 01:09:37,970
Ahh.

1668
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:39,680
You got one minute, Coach.

1669
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:42,558
Take the other time-out, Coach.

1670
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:44,810
Ronnie Bass!

1671
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:46,687
Coach, Rev's going back in, right?

1672
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:48,313
Not at quarterback, son.

1673
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:49,314
I can't make that pitch, Coach.

1674
01:09:49,398 --> 01:09:50,315
Yes, you can.

1675
01:09:52,025 --> 01:09:53,610
When I was 15 years old,

1676
01:09:53,694 --> 01:09:55,154
I lost my mother and my father

1677
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:57,663
in the same month, Ronnie-
the same month.

1678
01:09:57,698 --> 01:09:59,825
12 brothers and sisters.
I was the youngest one,

1679
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:01,535
but they were all
looking up to me.

1680
01:10:01,577 --> 01:10:03,704
Now, I wasn't ready yet,
either, but they needed me.

1681
01:10:03,745 --> 01:10:05,831
Your team needs you tonight.

1682
01:10:05,873 --> 01:10:06,999
You're the colonel.

1683
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,041
You're going to command
your troops tonight.

1684
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:09,126
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

1685
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:11,628
Twins right, 48, zero read.

1686
01:10:11,712 --> 01:10:13,422
Let's go.

1687
01:10:13,547 --> 01:10:14,423
Let's go.

1688
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:17,426
Let's go.

1689
01:10:17,551 --> 01:10:19,094
What's the matter?
Haven't you ever seen

1690
01:10:19,129 --> 01:10:20,637
a football injury before,
you wimps?

1691
01:10:20,721 --> 01:10:21,847
Let's go.
Show some life in those legs.

1692
01:10:21,889 --> 01:10:23,307
I got it. It's going to be all right.

1693
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:26,310
Budds, you release this time.

1694
01:10:26,351 --> 01:10:27,311
Louie, let him through, all right?

1695
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:29,188
- Just let him through.
- What?

1696
01:10:29,313 --> 01:10:30,189
Trust me.

1697
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:32,566
You had 12 brothers and sisters?

1698
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:33,859
8.

1699
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:35,194
Yeah.
12 sounds better.

1700
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:40,157
Ready!

1701
01:10:41,783 --> 01:10:43,327
Set!

1702
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:44,453
Blue, 21!

1703
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:45,746
Blue, 21!

1704
01:10:45,781 --> 01:10:47,039
Hut!

1705
01:10:52,211 --> 01:10:53,879
Ha ha ha!

1706
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:55,214
Whoo!

1707
01:10:56,381 --> 01:10:57,758
Whoo!

1708
01:10:59,384 --> 01:11:00,969
Ref!
Unnecessary roughness!

1709
01:11:01,053 --> 01:11:02,095
That's a penalty!

1710
01:11:02,221 --> 01:11:04,223
On the quarterback? Are
you kidding me, Coach?

1711
01:11:07,601 --> 01:11:09,186
# Na na na na #

1712
01:11:09,228 --> 01:11:11,772
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Did you see that, man?

1713
01:11:11,897 --> 01:11:13,982
That's a bad white boy, man.

1714
01:11:14,066 --> 01:11:15,400
Hike!

1715
01:11:15,484 --> 01:11:17,528
# Na na na na #

1716
01:11:17,611 --> 01:11:19,196
# Hey, hey, hey #

1717
01:11:19,238 --> 01:11:20,823
# Good-bye #

1718
01:11:20,948 --> 01:11:23,075
We've got ourselves
a football player.

1719
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:24,041
Hut!

1720
01:11:24,076 --> 01:11:25,786
# Na na na na #

1721
01:11:25,828 --> 01:11:27,538
# Hey, hey, hey #

1722
01:11:27,621 --> 01:11:29,373
- # Good-bye #
- Uhh!

1723
01:11:29,414 --> 01:11:32,209
Hut!

1724
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:34,086
# Na na na na #

1725
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:35,712
# Hey, hey, hey #

1726
01:11:35,796 --> 01:11:37,256
# It's all right #

1727
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:38,841
# Give it to me one time, hey #

1728
01:11:40,425 --> 01:11:41,969
# Na na na na #

1729
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,555
# Hey, hey, hey #

1730
01:11:44,596 --> 01:11:45,931
# Good-bye #

1731
01:11:48,976 --> 01:11:52,020
All right, listen up,
listen up, listen up.

1732
01:11:52,104 --> 01:11:53,981
Listen up, listen up.
Listen up.

1733
01:11:54,022 --> 01:11:54,982
Whoa.

1734
01:11:56,692 --> 01:11:58,110
Game ball-

1735
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:00,863
Ronnie Bass.

1736
01:12:04,324 --> 01:12:05,617
Hey, this ball right here...

1737
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:06,618
hey, this ball right here

1738
01:12:06,702 --> 01:12:08,120
goes to the real king right here.

1739
01:12:08,162 --> 01:12:09,454
Thanks for teaching me the veer, Rev.

1740
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:10,455
Aw, come on.

1741
01:12:10,581 --> 01:12:11,964
Rev!

1742
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:13,458
Rev! Rev! Rev!

1743
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:15,002
- Rev! Rev! Rev!
- Ow!

1744
01:12:15,043 --> 01:12:17,421
Rev! Rev! Rev!

1745
01:12:17,462 --> 01:12:19,590
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on.

1746
01:12:19,631 --> 01:12:21,341
Coach?

1747
01:12:21,425 --> 01:12:23,969
Can I speak with you in private?

1748
01:12:24,011 --> 01:12:25,429
Sure.

1749
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:26,763
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1750
01:12:26,847 --> 01:12:29,016
What's on your mind, son?

1751
01:12:30,642 --> 01:12:32,603
I want Ray off the team, Coach.

1752
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,898
You know my policy, Gerry.

1753
01:12:36,023 --> 01:12:37,281
Yes, I do,

1754
01:12:37,316 --> 01:12:38,442
and I respect it,

1755
01:12:38,567 --> 01:12:41,445
I know that Ray missed
that block on purpose.

1756
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:45,324
Sometimes you just got
to cut a man loose.

1757
01:12:47,326 --> 01:12:48,952
Hmm.

1758
01:12:49,036 --> 01:12:50,871
Well, you're the captain.

1759
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:53,499
You make a decision,

1760
01:12:53,624 --> 01:12:56,210
but you support your decision.

1761
01:12:56,293 --> 01:12:59,046
We're going to
remember this for a long time.

1762
01:12:59,081 --> 01:13:00,172
Hey, guys, wait up.

1763
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:02,758
I want to catch a ride with you.

1764
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:03,759
Ray?

1765
01:13:05,886 --> 01:13:08,055
Oh, man, not a word.

1766
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:09,056
You're out.

1767
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:10,891
What?

1768
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:13,519
I'm not going to let you
play for this team anymore.

1769
01:13:16,271 --> 01:13:18,982
Oh, yeah, Jerry Lewis?

1770
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:20,108
Going to go and tell "Coach Coon"

1771
01:13:20,234 --> 01:13:23,195
what to do just like last time?

1772
01:13:23,237 --> 01:13:25,239
But, then, that's right.

1773
01:13:25,364 --> 01:13:28,367
He is your daddy now, isn't he?

1774
01:13:28,402 --> 01:13:30,244
Boone don't cut anybody.

1775
01:13:30,279 --> 01:13:31,370
Remember, Gerry?

1776
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:34,540
I had you cut, Ray.

1777
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:37,835
You're willing to just throw away

1778
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:39,670
our friendship for them?

1779
01:13:41,505 --> 01:13:43,632
You can keep them.

1780
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,605
Hi.

1781
01:13:58,689 --> 01:14:01,275
# Now, I've been happy lately #

1782
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,444
# Thinkin' about
the good things to come #

1783
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:07,573
# And I believe it could be #

1784
01:14:07,614 --> 01:14:10,117
# Something good has begun #

1785
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,286
# Oh, I've been smilin' lately #

1786
01:14:12,411 --> 01:14:14,288
O- Officer?

1787
01:14:16,331 --> 01:14:19,126
Heck of a game you boys
played last night.

1788
01:14:20,544 --> 01:14:21,712
Thanks.

1789
01:14:21,753 --> 01:14:23,387
Thank you, Officer.

1790
01:14:23,422 --> 01:14:25,841
Best defense I've seen in 20 years.

1791
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:27,467
# Peace train #

1792
01:14:27,593 --> 01:14:28,468
Tell that coach of yours

1793
01:14:28,594 --> 01:14:30,846
to keep up the good work.

1794
01:14:30,888 --> 01:14:33,432
Oh. Oh, yeah.
I'll-I'll do that.

1795
01:14:33,474 --> 01:14:36,435
# Now, I've been smilin' lately #

1796
01:14:36,477 --> 01:14:39,605
# Thinkin' about
the good things to come #

1797
01:14:39,646 --> 01:14:41,899
# And I believe it could be #

1798
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,901
Yo, man, your taxi had a siren.

1799
01:14:43,942 --> 01:14:45,319
Superman!

1800
01:14:45,444 --> 01:14:47,029
Hey, man, what's going on?

1801
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:48,579
Doing all right.

1802
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:51,200
# Ride on the peace train #

1803
01:14:51,325 --> 01:14:54,495
# Hoo-ah-eeh-ah-hoo-ah #

1804
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:56,955
# Come on the peace train #

1805
01:14:57,039 --> 01:15:00,584
# Just come on the peace train #

1806
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:02,336
# Yes, it's the peace train #

1807
01:15:02,377 --> 01:15:04,463
Ohh!

1808
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:16,183
This song goes out

1809
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:17,392
to the undefeated Titans.

1810
01:15:17,518 --> 01:15:19,394
This city is alive with school spirit.

1811
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,522
Go get 'em, Titans!
Whoo!

1812
01:15:21,605 --> 01:15:24,691
# Saturday night I was downtown #

1813
01:15:24,775 --> 01:15:28,529
# Workin' for the FBI #

1814
01:15:28,654 --> 01:15:32,449
# Sittin' in a nest of bad men #

1815
01:15:32,484 --> 01:15:36,245
# Whiskey bottles piling high #

1816
01:15:36,286 --> 01:15:40,541
# A pair of. 45s
made me open my eyes #

1817
01:15:40,624 --> 01:15:45,128
# My temper just started to rise #

1818
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:48,966
# She was along cool woman
in a black dress #

1819
01:15:49,007 --> 01:15:52,845
# Just-a 5'9", beautiful, tall #

1820
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:56,014
# With just one look
I was a bad mess #

1821
01:15:56,098 --> 01:16:01,520
# 'Cause that long cool woman
had it all #

1822
01:16:07,568 --> 01:16:08,735
# Whoo #

1823
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:14,700
# Had it all #

1824
01:16:17,286 --> 01:16:19,580
# Ooh #

1825
01:16:19,621 --> 01:16:21,039
We are here tonight to honor men

1826
01:16:21,123 --> 01:16:23,292
that are teaching
our young people

1827
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:25,711
leadership on and off the field

1828
01:16:25,752 --> 01:16:27,588
and high moral standards as well.

1829
01:16:27,623 --> 01:16:29,256
Ladies and gentlemen,

1830
01:16:29,298 --> 01:16:33,552
let me introduce to you
the 1971 Hall of Fame nominees.

1831
01:16:35,596 --> 01:16:37,764
Come on, Daddy.

1832
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:39,308
Whoo!

1833
01:16:41,477 --> 01:16:42,561
When we played Jefferson,

1834
01:16:42,603 --> 01:16:44,938
we were down by 4
with 10 seconds left.

1835
01:16:45,022 --> 01:16:46,899
So we blitzed the safety
from the weak side...

1836
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:48,650
Wow.

1837
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:51,904
Heck of a season
the Titans are having, Coach.

1838
01:16:51,945 --> 01:16:53,614
Too bad it's got to end.

1839
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:56,283
Oh, we're still in it, Lyle.

1840
01:16:56,325 --> 01:16:57,493
Taber's boys are pretty good,

1841
01:16:57,618 --> 01:16:59,745
but I think we'll take
'em in the regional.

1842
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:02,748
Well, not if we have anything
to say about it.

1843
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:05,501
You just leave this to us, Bill.

1844
01:17:05,584 --> 01:17:09,317
Boone's out, and you're
head coach again.

1845
01:17:09,352 --> 01:17:13,050
And all roads lead
to the Hall of Fame.

1846
01:17:13,217 --> 01:17:14,176
Coach Taber?

1847
01:17:14,218 --> 01:17:15,636
What do you think
of the Titans, Coach?

1848
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:16,970
Think you have a chance
against that defense

1849
01:17:17,054 --> 01:17:18,597
they have over there at T.C.?

1850
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:21,975
Ton, Billy, Ray,
come on over here.

1851
01:17:22,059 --> 01:17:25,521
Boys. These are
my all-American tackles.

1852
01:17:25,604 --> 01:17:27,064
Prize bulls who don't do nothin'

1853
01:17:27,105 --> 01:17:29,107
but knock the chocolate
out of folks.

1854
01:17:29,233 --> 01:17:31,109
Is it true you're not gonna trade films

1855
01:17:31,193 --> 01:17:32,361
with Coach Boone?

1856
01:17:32,402 --> 01:17:35,364
I'm not gonna do anything
to help that monkey.

1857
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,284
Well...

1858
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:42,496
what are we going
to do about this?

1859
01:17:42,538 --> 01:17:45,249
We're gonna get ready
for Saturday.

1860
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:46,917
See you out there on the field.

1861
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:50,671
Hut!

1862
01:17:57,261 --> 01:17:58,644
Hey, Mr. Official.

1863
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:00,973
Mr. Official, can I talk
to you for a second?

1864
01:18:01,014 --> 01:18:03,142
Back off, Coach, if you
want to stay in this game.

1865
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,811
Hut!

1866
01:18:09,606 --> 01:18:11,692
I've got holding on 78 white.

1867
01:18:11,817 --> 01:18:14,444
Are you trying to cheat
my boys out of the game?

1868
01:18:14,528 --> 01:18:15,696
15 more yards.

1869
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:17,990
Let 'em play,
Ref, let 'em play.

1870
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:20,159
Let 'em play!
Let the boys play!

1871
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:21,160
Cheater!

1872
01:18:21,285 --> 01:18:22,161
Coach, come on.

1873
01:18:22,286 --> 01:18:23,245
Cheater!

1874
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:24,454
Coach.

1875
01:18:31,712 --> 01:18:32,880
Go, go, go, go!

1876
01:18:37,885 --> 01:18:40,429
Oh, come on!
What was that?!

1877
01:18:40,471 --> 01:18:42,181
Uhh!

1878
01:18:42,264 --> 01:18:43,849
What are you, blind?

1879
01:18:43,884 --> 01:18:45,434
That wasn't a hold.

1880
01:18:45,476 --> 01:18:48,353
Oh, come on, that was
such a bad call.

1881
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:53,025
Titus!

1882
01:18:56,778 --> 01:18:59,364
Give him a piece of your mind!

1883
01:19:04,203 --> 01:19:05,662
I know all about it, Titus.

1884
01:19:05,746 --> 01:19:07,331
What are you talking about, Bill?

1885
01:19:07,372 --> 01:19:08,665
You call this game fair,

1886
01:19:08,749 --> 01:19:11,043
or I'll go to the papers.

1887
01:19:11,084 --> 01:19:13,670
I don't care if I go down with ya,

1888
01:19:13,754 --> 01:19:16,381
but before God, I swear I'll see

1889
01:19:16,507 --> 01:19:19,051
every last one of you thrown in jail.

1890
01:19:19,176 --> 01:19:20,594
You dig your own grave.

1891
01:19:20,636 --> 01:19:22,638
OK.

1892
01:19:22,763 --> 01:19:24,348
Defense! On me!

1893
01:19:24,473 --> 01:19:27,643
OK, Petey, don't you drift
to the strong side.

1894
01:19:27,684 --> 01:19:29,645
Coach, they're callin' a holding
penalty on me every time.

1895
01:19:29,686 --> 01:19:31,104
Did I ask for your excuses?

1896
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:33,065
You want to act like a star,

1897
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:34,233
you better give me
a star effort,

1898
01:19:34,358 --> 01:19:35,943
Do you hear me?

1899
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,238
Forget about him!

1900
01:19:39,363 --> 01:19:41,907
Alan, you're in!

1901
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:43,207
Come on!

1902
01:19:43,242 --> 01:19:45,285
All right, now,

1903
01:19:45,369 --> 01:19:48,372
I don't want them
to gain another yard.

1904
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:51,083
You blitz all night!

1905
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:52,417
If they cross
the line of scrimmage,

1906
01:19:52,543 --> 01:19:54,378
I'm gonna take
every last one of you out.

1907
01:19:54,419 --> 01:19:56,088
You make sure...

1908
01:19:56,213 --> 01:19:59,508
they remember forever

1909
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:01,552
the night they played the Titans.

1910
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,223
Leave no doubt!

1911
01:20:08,517 --> 01:20:09,601
Set!

1912
01:20:09,685 --> 01:20:11,562
Come on, y'all!
Swing it left!

1913
01:20:11,603 --> 01:20:13,438
All right! All right!
All right!

1914
01:20:13,522 --> 01:20:15,399
Set! Hut!

1915
01:20:23,157 --> 01:20:26,535
You better make yourself
comfortable down there.

1916
01:20:26,577 --> 01:20:27,578
Real comfortable.

1917
01:20:55,314 --> 01:20:56,940
You did good!

1918
01:20:57,024 --> 01:20:58,942
That one was for you, Coach.

1919
01:20:59,026 --> 01:21:00,611
All right, baby.
All right.

1920
01:21:00,652 --> 01:21:02,863
You brought us here,
Coach.

1921
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:04,448
Run it up, Herman!

1922
01:21:04,573 --> 01:21:06,325
Leave no doubt!

1923
01:21:06,366 --> 01:21:09,453
# Music's in your city, too #

1924
01:21:09,495 --> 01:21:11,788
Set! Hut!

1925
01:21:11,872 --> 01:21:14,291
# Music's gettin' good to me #

1926
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:16,793
# But now, don't ya, I said don't ya #

1927
01:21:16,877 --> 01:21:19,379
# Don't you want to get higher? #

1928
01:21:19,505 --> 01:21:20,693
Hut hut!

1929
01:21:20,728 --> 01:21:21,882
# Yeah #

1930
01:21:21,924 --> 01:21:23,759
# Don't you want to get higher? #

1931
01:21:23,884 --> 01:21:28,263
# Baby, baby, let me light your fire #

1932
01:21:28,347 --> 01:21:32,392
# Oohha, little bit higher #

1933
01:21:32,518 --> 01:21:35,062
Good game.

1934
01:21:35,097 --> 01:21:36,104
Yeah.

1935
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:39,399
Good game.

1936
01:21:39,525 --> 01:21:41,360
Coach. Coach.

1937
01:21:42,611 --> 01:21:44,696
I took a straw poll.

1938
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:48,534
You just lost yourself the Hall of Fame.

1939
01:21:55,249 --> 01:21:57,000
Good game, y'all.

1940
01:21:57,084 --> 01:21:58,836
Hey, good job, 43.

1941
01:21:58,919 --> 01:22:00,504
Good job.
Good job, men.

1942
01:22:00,539 --> 01:22:02,089
Good job.
Hey, way to stick.

1943
01:22:02,214 --> 01:22:03,674
Good job.

1944
01:22:03,715 --> 01:22:05,008
Good game, Coach.

1945
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:09,972
Coach.

1946
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:30,242
Yeah!

1947
01:22:31,285 --> 01:22:32,953
Titans!

1948
01:22:32,995 --> 01:22:34,705
Yeah!

1949
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,415
Petey!

1950
01:22:36,456 --> 01:22:37,812
What happened out there, man?

1951
01:22:37,847 --> 01:22:39,168
Come on, talk to me, Petey.

1952
01:22:40,586 --> 01:22:41,545
Petey!

1953
01:22:41,587 --> 01:22:43,714
I'm so proud of you.

1954
01:22:43,755 --> 01:22:45,299
Hey, Julius.

1955
01:22:45,424 --> 01:22:46,550
Julius.

1956
01:22:46,592 --> 01:22:47,843
Come here, man.

1957
01:22:47,885 --> 01:22:48,844
Don't move.

1958
01:22:48,886 --> 01:22:49,845
Go on. It's OK.

1959
01:22:49,887 --> 01:22:51,180
- Man.
- What's up, man?

1960
01:22:51,263 --> 01:22:52,848
Let's get out of here.

1961
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:54,475
Let's go paint the town
or something.

1962
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:55,476
Let's go. Let's go.

1963
01:22:55,601 --> 01:22:56,935
I- I got to hang
with my girl tonight.

1964
01:22:57,019 --> 01:22:58,061
I got to hang with her tonight.

1965
01:22:58,187 --> 01:22:59,438
All right, all right.

1966
01:22:59,473 --> 01:23:00,772
Where you going?

1967
01:23:00,856 --> 01:23:01,940
I don't know.

1968
01:23:02,024 --> 01:23:04,902
I- I don't know,
but I'm gonna go. All right?

1969
01:23:04,943 --> 01:23:06,069
- You gonna go?
- Yeah, man.

1970
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:08,447
I want to go, man, but you
know what I mean, man.

1971
01:23:08,572 --> 01:23:09,490
I know. I'll see ya.

1972
01:23:22,044 --> 01:23:24,046
Looks like you weren't the one

1973
01:23:24,087 --> 01:23:25,964
with the mixed-up
priorities, huh?

1974
01:23:26,048 --> 01:23:27,598
Emma...

1975
01:23:27,633 --> 01:23:30,344
I think it's gonna
take me a little longer

1976
01:23:30,469 --> 01:23:32,262
than you might like.

1977
01:23:32,346 --> 01:23:33,472
But, um...

1978
01:23:34,973 --> 01:23:38,769
I just wanted you to know
that I'm gonna try.

1979
01:23:42,773 --> 01:23:44,191
Good-bye, Gerry.

1980
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:48,487
Emma?

1981
01:23:48,529 --> 01:23:50,614
Make me a promise?

1982
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:52,950
You'll be there to root for us

1983
01:23:52,991 --> 01:23:55,118
when we play Marshall
for the title?

1984
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:03,710
# Just yesterday mornin' #

1985
01:24:03,836 --> 01:24:06,505
I know how much it meant to you.

1986
01:24:08,132 --> 01:24:10,843
I ain't gonna lie.

1987
01:24:10,968 --> 01:24:13,554
I wanted the Hall of Fame real bad.

1988
01:24:13,595 --> 01:24:16,515
Just plain old jealousy.

1989
01:24:16,557 --> 01:24:18,684
As old as Cain and Abel.

1990
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,018
You know what?

1991
01:24:20,102 --> 01:24:22,980
I wanted it, too.

1992
01:24:23,021 --> 01:24:26,275
But there's always next year
or the year after that.

1993
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,694
As long as it takes
for them to wise up.

1994
01:24:28,735 --> 01:24:31,738
Wouldn't want it now anyway.

1995
01:24:31,864 --> 01:24:33,831
Bunch of ol' rednecks.

1996
01:24:33,866 --> 01:24:36,410
# That I thought
would never end #

1997
01:24:38,162 --> 01:24:39,705
# I've seen lonely times #

1998
01:24:39,746 --> 01:24:42,708
Let's knock 'em dead
at state, Coach.

1999
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:43,709
Daddy!

2000
01:24:43,834 --> 01:24:44,710
Daddy!

2001
01:24:44,835 --> 01:24:45,711
Daddy!

2002
01:24:45,836 --> 01:24:48,422
Daddy! You're home!

2003
01:24:48,463 --> 01:24:49,882
My girls! Mmm-ah!

2004
01:24:49,923 --> 01:24:52,050
Give me a kiss.
Mmm-ah!

2005
01:24:52,176 --> 01:24:53,719
Congratulations, Herman.

2006
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,012
All right. Mmm.

2007
01:24:55,053 --> 01:24:56,597
What'd I tell you, baby, huh?

2008
01:24:56,722 --> 01:24:59,141
Yeah, we can't get too
far ahead of ourselves.

2009
01:24:59,183 --> 01:25:02,311
We still got to get
Ed Henry and Marshall.

2010
01:25:02,352 --> 01:25:03,604
We got all these-

2011
01:25:03,729 --> 01:25:05,731
You've done a good job,
Coach Boone!

2012
01:25:05,766 --> 01:25:06,732
Congratulations!

2013
01:25:08,192 --> 01:25:09,443
# My body's achin' #

2014
01:25:09,568 --> 01:25:12,446
# And my time is at hand #

2015
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:15,616
# I won't make it any other way #

2016
01:25:15,651 --> 01:25:18,876
Well, I'll be John Brown.

2017
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:20,454
We cleaned up the kitchen, Daddy,

2018
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:23,499
so you could get right to work.

2019
01:25:23,624 --> 01:25:24,583
You did?

2020
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:26,272
Well, I got news for you.

2021
01:25:26,307 --> 01:25:27,885
I ain't workin' tonight.

2022
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,046
Tonight, we're gonna celebrate.

2023
01:25:29,087 --> 01:25:30,506
We're gonna let these people know

2024
01:25:30,631 --> 01:25:31,590
who's gonna win state.

2025
01:25:31,632 --> 01:25:32,633
- Right?
- Right!

2026
01:25:32,668 --> 01:25:35,636
- Right?!
- Right!

2027
01:25:35,677 --> 01:25:36,929
Everybody!

2028
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:38,597
We're gonna win state!

2029
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:43,477
# But I always thought
that I'd see you again #

2030
01:25:43,519 --> 01:25:45,354
We're gonna win state!

2031
01:25:45,395 --> 01:25:49,358
# Oh, I've seen fire,
and I've seen rain #

2032
01:25:50,776 --> 01:25:52,277
# I've seen sunny days #

2033
01:25:52,361 --> 01:25:55,364
# That I thought
would never end #

2034
01:25:57,074 --> 01:25:58,534
# I've seen lonely times #

2035
01:25:58,659 --> 01:26:01,662
# When I could not find a friend #

2036
01:26:03,247 --> 01:26:05,791
# But I always thought
that I'd see you #

2037
01:26:05,826 --> 01:26:06,955
Hey, Gerry!
You man!

2038
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:08,085
No, you!
No, you, you!

2039
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:10,504
You! Yeah!

2040
01:26:12,422 --> 01:26:16,677
# Thought I'd see you
one more time again #

2041
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:22,224
Oh, shoot! Gerry!
Are you OK?

2042
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:46,707
How you doin', son?

2043
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:48,250
He ain't all right?
He all right?

2044
01:26:48,292 --> 01:26:49,334
He's, uh...

2045
01:26:49,418 --> 01:26:50,627
How's he doing?

2046
01:26:53,172 --> 01:26:56,175
Not too good.
Not too good.

2047
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:57,843
How well is he doing?

2048
01:26:57,885 --> 01:27:01,555
How bad is it?

2049
01:27:01,597 --> 01:27:04,600
He's paralyzed
from the waist down.

2050
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:08,187
Don't say that to me.
Don't say that to me.

2051
01:27:12,774 --> 01:27:14,276
Sorry, Mrs. Bertier.

2052
01:27:15,444 --> 01:27:19,031
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2053
01:27:20,449 --> 01:27:23,327
He doesn't want to see
anybody but you, Julius.

2054
01:27:23,368 --> 01:27:24,745
Yes, ma'am.

2055
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:26,455
You be strong.

2056
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:27,789
Yes, ma'am.

2057
01:27:27,915 --> 01:27:31,919
Those tears are not gonna
make my boy walk again.

2058
01:27:42,387 --> 01:27:44,056
Only kin's allowed in here.

2059
01:27:44,181 --> 01:27:47,601
Alice, are you blind?

2060
01:27:47,643 --> 01:27:50,938
Don't you see
the family resemblance?

2061
01:27:51,063 --> 01:27:52,940
That's my brother.

2062
01:27:55,275 --> 01:27:56,777
All right.

2063
01:28:10,249 --> 01:28:11,917
Oh, man.

2064
01:28:11,959 --> 01:28:14,253
Well, you think I look banged up,

2065
01:28:14,288 --> 01:28:16,088
you should see my Camaro.

2066
01:28:16,213 --> 01:28:21,093
Man, I sure am sorry, man.

2067
01:28:21,135 --> 01:28:23,720
I should have been there with you.

2068
01:28:23,804 --> 01:28:27,141
What are you talking about?

2069
01:28:27,266 --> 01:28:29,726
You would've been in that bed
right next to me.

2070
01:28:29,852 --> 01:28:32,521
You can't be hurt like this.

2071
01:28:34,606 --> 01:28:37,693
You-you're Superman.

2072
01:28:44,575 --> 01:28:46,410
I was afraid of you, Julius.

2073
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:52,958
I only saw what I was afraid of.

2074
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:56,545
And now I know I was
only hating my brother.

2075
01:28:59,298 --> 01:29:01,425
I'll tell you what, though.

2076
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:04,011
Um, when all this is over...

2077
01:29:04,052 --> 01:29:06,555
me and you are
gonna move out

2078
01:29:06,597 --> 01:29:08,140
to the same
neighborhood together.

2079
01:29:08,182 --> 01:29:12,019
OK? And, um...

2080
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:15,772
and we'll get old,
and we'll get fat.

2081
01:29:15,856 --> 01:29:17,774
And there ain't gonna be
all this black-white

2082
01:29:17,858 --> 01:29:18,859
between us.

2083
01:29:24,948 --> 01:29:27,159
Left side.

2084
01:29:29,036 --> 01:29:31,038
Strong side.

2085
01:29:38,086 --> 01:29:40,506
Good morning.

2086
01:29:42,174 --> 01:29:44,968
Uh, the Marshall film.

2087
01:29:45,052 --> 01:29:46,345
Well, that's good.

2088
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:47,638
We're gonna have to be real sharp

2089
01:29:47,763 --> 01:29:50,682
on the offensive
and defensive sides

2090
01:29:50,766 --> 01:29:51,975
of the football.

2091
01:29:52,059 --> 01:29:53,484
Figure we give the kids

2092
01:29:53,519 --> 01:29:55,062
a couple of extra
practices this week,

2093
01:29:55,097 --> 01:29:56,605
make sure they stay focused.

2094
01:29:56,647 --> 01:29:59,900
Got a press conference
today at 12 noon.

2095
01:29:59,942 --> 01:30:02,236
Press conference?

2096
01:30:02,361 --> 01:30:05,614
Listen, what we do here
amongst ourselves is one thing,

2097
01:30:05,656 --> 01:30:07,783
but we are not gonna
parade around

2098
01:30:07,908 --> 01:30:09,451
talking about football
at a time like this.

2099
01:30:09,486 --> 01:30:10,994
Hold on. I'm not talking
about parading.

2100
01:30:11,078 --> 01:30:12,996
I'm talking about going out there,

2101
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,915
presentin' a strong,
united front.

2102
01:30:14,957 --> 01:30:17,000
Now, I'm hurtin'...

2103
01:30:17,084 --> 01:30:18,919
just like you are, Yoast,

2104
01:30:18,961 --> 01:30:21,713
but the season is not over yet.

2105
01:30:21,839 --> 01:30:24,404
I did-We did not come this far

2106
01:30:24,439 --> 01:30:26,969
to just break down and lose now.

2107
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:30,389
Everything's not always
about winning and losing.

2108
01:30:30,424 --> 01:30:32,391
I'm a winner.

2109
01:30:33,976 --> 01:30:36,019
I'm going to win.

2110
01:30:36,103 --> 01:30:39,398
Is this even about
football anymore?

2111
01:30:39,523 --> 01:30:41,567
Or is it just about you?

2112
01:30:42,734 --> 01:30:44,403
Coach Boone...

2113
01:30:44,444 --> 01:30:46,989
Uh, Coach, you lost Bertier...

2114
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:48,615
Is your defense in trouble?

2115
01:30:48,699 --> 01:30:51,160
You cannot replace
a Gerry Bertier...

2116
01:30:53,579 --> 01:30:56,039
as a player or person.

2117
01:31:01,128 --> 01:31:02,588
I don't know, Mama.

2118
01:31:07,134 --> 01:31:08,427
Maybe Yoast was right.

2119
01:31:08,469 --> 01:31:10,429
Maybe I pushed 'em too hard.

2120
01:31:10,471 --> 01:31:12,598
Gerry had an accident.

2121
01:31:14,433 --> 01:31:16,602
Sometimes life's just hard.

2122
01:31:17,895 --> 01:31:19,646
For no reason at all.

2123
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:22,441
You think I was blinded
by my own ambition?

2124
01:31:22,476 --> 01:31:27,196
Mm. Whatever kind
of ambition it took

2125
01:31:27,321 --> 01:31:30,032
to do what you did
around here...

2126
01:31:30,073 --> 01:31:32,743
this world could use
a lot more of it, Herman.

2127
01:31:32,868 --> 01:31:34,286
Hmm.

2128
01:31:44,755 --> 01:31:47,341
Hey, Coach.

2129
01:31:47,382 --> 01:31:48,634
How you doing?

2130
01:31:54,932 --> 01:31:56,683
This for me?

2131
01:31:56,767 --> 01:32:00,187
I want you to be my eyes
out there, all right?

2132
01:32:02,064 --> 01:32:03,524
Any of these guys slack off,

2133
01:32:03,649 --> 01:32:05,484
you just let me know.

2134
01:32:05,526 --> 01:32:07,236
You bet I will.

2135
01:32:08,987 --> 01:32:11,406
How you doing, Gerry?

2136
01:32:11,532 --> 01:32:13,116
I'm all right, Coach.

2137
01:32:13,242 --> 01:32:14,701
I was just talking
to these guys about Marshall,

2138
01:32:14,785 --> 01:32:15,828
trying to get 'em-

2139
01:32:15,953 --> 01:32:18,205
You don't need to talk
about football now.

2140
01:32:18,247 --> 01:32:20,666
I think this is a good
time for refection

2141
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:21,834
and for prayer-

2142
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:23,377
Coach...

2143
01:32:23,502 --> 01:32:25,254
I'm hurt.

2144
01:32:25,379 --> 01:32:26,505
I ain't dead.

2145
01:32:26,547 --> 01:32:30,717
No, you're not.

2146
01:32:32,511 --> 01:32:34,721
You know, I've been,
uh, reading up

2147
01:32:34,847 --> 01:32:37,224
on the activities
that they got for people

2148
01:32:37,266 --> 01:32:39,560
in wheelchairs and such.

2149
01:32:39,685 --> 01:32:42,563
They got Olympics.

2150
01:32:45,566 --> 01:32:46,824
This is the granddaddy

2151
01:32:46,859 --> 01:32:49,528
of state high school football
championships.

2152
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:51,370
The Virginia triple 'A. "

2153
01:32:51,405 --> 01:32:54,373
It just doesn't get any better.

2154
01:32:54,408 --> 01:32:56,285
We have
Coach Herman Boone's Titans

2155
01:32:56,326 --> 01:32:58,537
vs. the legend, Ed Henry,

2156
01:32:58,579 --> 01:33:02,583
with over 250 wins in 30 years.

2157
01:33:03,584 --> 01:33:05,106
Amen.

2158
01:33:05,141 --> 01:33:06,628
Let's go!

2159
01:33:12,259 --> 01:33:14,052
Lastik,
what's the matter?

2160
01:33:14,136 --> 01:33:17,014
I'm eligible.

2161
01:33:18,599 --> 01:33:20,726
Well, um, I'm glad
to hear that, son,

2162
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:22,144
but I'm already married.

2163
01:33:22,186 --> 01:33:26,148
I got a C-plus average, Coach.

2164
01:33:26,190 --> 01:33:28,150
I'm going to college.

2165
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:31,737
All right, fantastic.

2166
01:33:31,778 --> 01:33:33,704
Coach? Coach?

2167
01:33:33,739 --> 01:33:35,908
I just want to say I'm sorry.

2168
01:33:35,949 --> 01:33:38,452
You abandoned your team
in their moment of need, Petey.

2169
01:33:38,487 --> 01:33:39,453
"Sorry" won't make up for that.

2170
01:33:39,495 --> 01:33:40,746
Yeah, I know, but...

2171
01:33:40,787 --> 01:33:42,789
listen, I want to play for you.

2172
01:33:42,915 --> 01:33:44,666
I want to play
for the championship.

2173
01:33:44,750 --> 01:33:46,293
You can play for me
next year.

2174
01:33:46,335 --> 01:33:47,628
You sit on that bench.

2175
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:49,630
Show me you can support
your teammates.

2176
01:33:49,755 --> 01:33:51,632
You'll start again as a senior.

2177
01:33:59,765 --> 01:34:00,933
Entering the stadium now

2178
01:34:00,974 --> 01:34:03,227
is Jean Bertier.
Now, she's the mother

2179
01:34:03,268 --> 01:34:06,688
of injured all-American
linebacker, Gerry Bertier.

2180
01:34:06,772 --> 01:34:08,357
And the Titan fans

2181
01:34:08,482 --> 01:34:10,692
are really giving her
a warm reception.

2182
01:34:16,782 --> 01:34:22,663
Gerry! Gerry! Gerry!

2183
01:34:22,788 --> 01:34:31,839
Gerry! Gerry! Gerry!

2184
01:34:31,964 --> 01:34:37,261
Gerry! Gerry! Gerry!

2185
01:34:37,302 --> 01:34:38,804
And here come the Titans,

2186
01:34:38,846 --> 01:34:40,222
entering the stadium

2187
01:34:40,264 --> 01:34:42,516
in what's become
their own unique style.

2188
01:34:42,558 --> 01:34:44,726
# We feel, hoo, hah, real good #

2189
01:34:44,852 --> 01:34:46,937
# Hoo, hah, we feel #

2190
01:34:46,979 --> 01:34:48,730
# Hoo, hah, real good #

2191
01:34:48,856 --> 01:34:50,440
# Hoo, hah, we feel #

2192
01:34:50,566 --> 01:34:52,317
# Hoo, hah, real good #

2193
01:34:52,401 --> 01:34:54,153
# Hoo, hah, we feel #

2194
01:34:54,278 --> 01:34:55,863
# Hoo, hah, real good #

2195
01:34:55,946 --> 01:34:57,865
# Hoo, hah, we feel #

2196
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:59,867
# Hoo, hah, real good #

2197
01:35:06,415 --> 01:35:08,292
Julius Campbell?

2198
01:35:10,419 --> 01:35:12,296
Hi, I'm Emma Hoyt.

2199
01:35:12,337 --> 01:35:15,466
Oh. Oh, I guess
we never met, huh?

2200
01:35:15,591 --> 01:35:17,342
Uh, excuse me, young lady.
You can't be here right now.

2201
01:35:17,426 --> 01:35:20,012
Your gonna have
to get back to your seat.

2202
01:35:22,347 --> 01:35:23,474
Well, now we've met.

2203
01:35:25,058 --> 01:35:27,186
Yeah.
It's nice to meet you.

2204
01:35:27,269 --> 01:35:28,854
Good luck, Julius.

2205
01:35:28,896 --> 01:35:30,022
2! 21!

2206
01:35:30,063 --> 01:35:31,023
Whoa! Wait!

2207
01:35:31,148 --> 01:35:32,357
What the hell's going on?

2208
01:35:32,441 --> 01:35:33,484
Shotgun.

2209
01:35:33,567 --> 01:35:35,027
Who do they think they are,

2210
01:35:35,068 --> 01:35:36,195
the New York Jets?

2211
01:35:36,278 --> 01:35:37,196
Switch! Switch!

2212
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:38,280
Get 9!

2213
01:35:38,322 --> 01:35:40,908
Get 9!
Bosley, move!

2214
01:35:41,033 --> 01:35:44,203
Move it up! Line up!
Get Bosley! Get 9! Get 9!

2215
01:35:45,913 --> 01:35:47,206
All right, let's go!

2216
01:35:47,289 --> 01:35:48,290
Hut hut!

2217
01:35:53,629 --> 01:35:54,671
Real good.

2218
01:35:54,755 --> 01:35:55,923
Keep it up.
Shotgun rush.

2219
01:35:56,048 --> 01:35:59,218
Cover 3!
Go to cover 3! Pass!

2220
01:35:59,343 --> 01:36:00,636
Hut!

2221
01:36:10,395 --> 01:36:11,792
Put some pressure on that QB.

2222
01:36:11,827 --> 01:36:13,190
They got all day to throw, Coach.

2223
01:36:13,232 --> 01:36:14,775
You just worry
about your offense.

2224
01:36:17,069 --> 01:36:19,238
Let's go!
Swing it! Swing it!

2225
01:36:19,404 --> 01:36:20,364
Set!

2226
01:36:20,405 --> 01:36:21,365
Get set! Get set!

2227
01:36:21,406 --> 01:36:23,116
Hut!

2228
01:36:26,245 --> 01:36:27,246
Yeah!

2229
01:36:29,248 --> 01:36:31,208
No!

2230
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,501
What's wrong, Gerry?

2231
01:36:32,543 --> 01:36:35,003
Do not come in here!

2232
01:36:36,964 --> 01:36:38,090
They got receivers
everywhere out there.

2233
01:36:38,215 --> 01:36:39,967
It's like watching
Monday Night Football.

2234
01:36:40,092 --> 01:36:41,969
Good hustle, good hustle,
good hustle.

2235
01:36:42,004 --> 01:36:43,846
Just give him a little cushion.

2236
01:36:43,971 --> 01:36:45,556
And when they throw
that ball, you stick him.

2237
01:36:45,597 --> 01:36:46,682
- Ready?
- Break!

2238
01:36:49,268 --> 01:36:50,727
Ready?!

2239
01:36:50,853 --> 01:36:52,980
Red, 57!

2240
01:36:53,105 --> 01:36:54,314
Red, 57!

2241
01:36:54,398 --> 01:36:57,151
Hut! Hut hut!

2242
01:37:02,531 --> 01:37:03,866
Titans star quarterback,

2243
01:37:03,991 --> 01:37:07,452
Ronnie Bass, gains 6 yards.

2244
01:37:07,578 --> 01:37:09,329
What you think? You
think we got a chance?

2245
01:37:09,413 --> 01:37:10,873
Got to give me some way
to disguise that coverage.

2246
01:37:10,998 --> 01:37:12,291
Let's start thinking
about it. Let's go.

2247
01:37:12,332 --> 01:37:13,709
Ready!

2248
01:37:13,834 --> 01:37:15,711
Set!

2249
01:37:15,752 --> 01:37:16,712
Hut!

2250
01:37:26,722 --> 01:37:28,599
They're a mile ahead of us.

2251
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:29,850
He's a mile ahead of you, Coach.

2252
01:37:29,892 --> 01:37:31,185
If your defense
would stop somebody,

2253
01:37:31,268 --> 01:37:32,895
we'd get the ball a little more.

2254
01:37:32,936 --> 01:37:34,313
Well, the Titans gave 'em a scare,

2255
01:37:34,438 --> 01:37:37,274
but Ed Henry looks
supremely confident.

2256
01:37:37,316 --> 01:37:39,735
T.C. Williams goes in at the half

2257
01:37:39,776 --> 01:37:41,445
trailing 7-0.

2258
01:37:41,487 --> 01:37:43,030
Coach!

2259
01:37:43,155 --> 01:37:44,198
Sweetheart.

2260
01:37:44,281 --> 01:37:45,324
You better get back to your seat.

2261
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:47,034
I can't, Coach.
What?

2262
01:37:47,159 --> 01:37:49,286
Ed Henry's got Boone's
number, sure as shoot in'.

2263
01:37:49,328 --> 01:37:53,081
And you ain't doin' nothin'
against that shotgun.

2264
01:37:53,207 --> 01:37:54,333
Look, Coach...

2265
01:37:54,458 --> 01:37:57,085
now ain't the time to be proud.

2266
01:37:57,211 --> 01:37:59,505
It's all right.
We're in a fight.

2267
01:38:00,631 --> 01:38:03,217
You boys are doing
all that you can do.

2268
01:38:03,258 --> 01:38:04,676
Anybody can see that.

2269
01:38:06,094 --> 01:38:09,313
Win or lose...

2270
01:38:09,348 --> 01:38:11,225
we gonna walk out
of this stadium tonight

2271
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:12,810
with our heads held high.

2272
01:38:14,937 --> 01:38:16,396
Do your best.

2273
01:38:16,522 --> 01:38:18,524
That's all anybody can ask for.

2274
01:38:18,649 --> 01:38:19,900
No, it ain't, Coach.

2275
01:38:19,942 --> 01:38:23,821
With all due respect, uh,
you demanded more of us.

2276
01:38:23,904 --> 01:38:26,240
You demanded perfection.

2277
01:38:26,365 --> 01:38:29,993
Now, I ain't saying that
I'm perfect, 'cause I'm not.

2278
01:38:30,077 --> 01:38:32,663
And I ain't gonna never be.
None of us are.

2279
01:38:32,788 --> 01:38:37,000
But we have won every single
game we have played till now.

2280
01:38:37,084 --> 01:38:40,254
So this team is perfect.

2281
01:38:40,295 --> 01:38:43,590
We stepped out on that field
that way tonight.

2282
01:38:43,674 --> 01:38:46,677
And, uh, if it's all the same
to you, Coach Boone,

2283
01:38:46,718 --> 01:38:48,720
that's how we want to leave it.

2284
01:38:48,846 --> 01:38:50,139
Yeah.

2285
01:38:50,264 --> 01:38:53,225
I hope you boys have learned
as much from me this year

2286
01:38:53,267 --> 01:38:55,435
as I've learned from you.

2287
01:38:55,561 --> 01:38:58,856
You've taught this city how
to trust the soul of a man

2288
01:38:58,939 --> 01:39:00,732
rather than the look of him.

2289
01:39:00,858 --> 01:39:04,111
And I guess it's about time
I joined the club.

2290
01:39:04,153 --> 01:39:06,989
Herman! I sure could
use your help.

2291
01:39:07,114 --> 01:39:09,283
Ed Henry's kicking my ass
out there.

2292
01:39:09,408 --> 01:39:11,869
Listen up.
This is our time now.

2293
01:39:11,994 --> 01:39:13,871
Second half is our time!

2294
01:39:13,954 --> 01:39:15,414
We gonna make some changes
on defense.

2295
01:39:15,539 --> 01:39:17,040
They're spreading us out too far.

2296
01:39:17,124 --> 01:39:21,295
We gonna put Sunshine, Alan,
Glascoe, Davis.

2297
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:23,922
You gonna play both ways,
rest of the game.

2298
01:39:24,006 --> 01:39:25,257
I don't want a receiver

2299
01:39:25,299 --> 01:39:27,009
to get across that line of scrimmage.

2300
01:39:27,134 --> 01:39:29,428
Coach Yoast will tell you
where you're playing, all right?

2301
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:31,013
Let's go. It's our time.
Everybody in.

2302
01:39:31,138 --> 01:39:33,182
Our time! Our time!
Our time!

2303
01:39:33,265 --> 01:39:35,309
Titans on 3! 1, 2, 3!

2304
01:39:35,434 --> 01:39:36,351
Titans!

2305
01:39:36,435 --> 01:39:38,896
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

2306
01:39:38,937 --> 01:39:40,147
All right, Julius.

2307
01:39:40,189 --> 01:39:41,607
We're gonna go 52 monster.

2308
01:39:41,648 --> 01:39:43,317
I know that's all
you need to know.

2309
01:39:43,442 --> 01:39:45,027
All right, we're going
zone, Alan. I need-

2310
01:39:45,152 --> 01:39:46,195
Sir, I could play with Roosevelt.

2311
01:39:46,278 --> 01:39:48,322
But I cannot play with these guys.

2312
01:39:48,447 --> 01:39:49,948
No, I tell you what.

2313
01:39:50,032 --> 01:39:51,658
I didn't warm the bench all year

2314
01:39:51,742 --> 01:39:53,577
so I could watch us
go down on my account.

2315
01:39:53,619 --> 01:39:56,747
Put Petey in. He's better.

2316
01:39:56,872 --> 01:39:59,166
You want him to take your spot,

2317
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:01,168
you go give it to him.

2318
01:40:02,628 --> 01:40:03,754
Thank you.

2319
01:40:12,513 --> 01:40:14,515
Ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

2320
01:40:18,644 --> 01:40:19,645
All right, Petey!

2321
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:21,605
All right!
That was beautiful!

2322
01:40:23,232 --> 01:40:25,067
Offense, let's go.

2323
01:40:25,108 --> 01:40:26,693
# There's a place up ahead #

2324
01:40:26,777 --> 01:40:28,111
# And I'm goin' #

2325
01:40:28,195 --> 01:40:31,365
# Just as fast as my feet can fly #

2326
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:34,952
# Come away, come away
if you're goin' #

2327
01:40:34,993 --> 01:40:38,497
# Leave the sinkin' ship behind #

2328
01:40:38,539 --> 01:40:42,000
# Come on the risin' wind #

2329
01:40:42,084 --> 01:40:43,961
# We're goin' up
around the bend #

2330
01:40:44,002 --> 01:40:46,296
All right, Defense?
Get out there!

2331
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:47,589
Let's go! Let's stop 'em!

2332
01:40:47,673 --> 01:40:50,259
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

2333
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:55,305
# Better get while
the gettin's good #

2334
01:40:55,389 --> 01:40:58,851
# Hitch a ride to the end
of the highway #

2335
01:40:58,934 --> 01:41:00,269
# Where the neons
turn to wood #

2336
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:02,563
O-2... inside veer.
O-2 inside veer.

2337
01:41:02,604 --> 01:41:05,732
# Come on the risin' wind #

2338
01:41:05,858 --> 01:41:09,278
# We're goin' up
around the bend #

2339
01:41:09,319 --> 01:41:11,405
# Ooh #

2340
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:15,701
# You can ponder
perpetual motion #

2341
01:41:15,742 --> 01:41:18,871
A field goal attempt for T.C. Williams.

2342
01:41:18,996 --> 01:41:20,379
It's good!

2343
01:41:20,414 --> 01:41:23,125
# Always time for
a good conversation #

2344
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:26,295
So they trail Marshall 7-3,

2345
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:27,838
heading into
the fourth quarter.

2346
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:29,715
Ref. He's lining up off sides!

2347
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:31,175
Look, 48's off sides!

2348
01:41:31,258 --> 01:41:32,759
Freeze right, 99 Z go.

2349
01:41:32,885 --> 01:41:34,428
Ref, I know you can see him!
You got eyes!

2350
01:41:34,553 --> 01:41:36,763
Gun-right, 84, X-flat.

2351
01:41:36,889 --> 01:41:39,266
And tell Tommy to watch
the free safety. Go.

2352
01:41:39,308 --> 01:41:40,934
Get right in there, Blue.
You know what I'm talking about.

2353
01:41:41,018 --> 01:41:42,853
You can't be afraid.

2354
01:41:42,895 --> 01:41:46,356
He's off sides!
He's lining up off sides!

2355
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:48,192
Got to hold them here,
Defense!

2356
01:41:48,275 --> 01:41:49,318
Hold 'em right here!

2357
01:41:49,359 --> 01:41:51,653
Whoa! Pass! Pass!

2358
01:41:51,737 --> 01:41:54,198
Let's go, Offense.
Let's go.

2359
01:41:58,327 --> 01:42:01,330
Titans trail Marshall 7-3.

2360
01:42:01,371 --> 01:42:02,810
All Marshall has to do

2361
01:42:02,845 --> 01:42:04,249
is hold on to the ball,

2362
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:06,502
and they will be
the state champions.

2363
01:42:06,627 --> 01:42:08,212
Watch 'em on the weak side!

2364
01:42:08,337 --> 01:42:10,088
On the weak side!

2365
01:42:23,519 --> 01:42:25,479
Hold on to that ball,
Petey!

2366
01:42:26,688 --> 01:42:28,524
Hold the ball!
Hold the ball!

2367
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:30,901
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold on to that ball!

2368
01:42:30,943 --> 01:42:32,361
Hold on to that ball!

2369
01:42:32,402 --> 01:42:34,905
Hold on to that ball,
Petey!

2370
01:42:34,947 --> 01:42:37,282
All right! All right!

2371
01:42:37,366 --> 01:42:39,409
Ohh, Petey!

2372
01:42:41,286 --> 01:42:42,120
Coach.

2373
01:42:42,246 --> 01:42:43,413
Get a time-out!
Time-out!

2374
01:42:43,497 --> 01:42:45,207
Coach, they're slanting to
our strong side every time.

2375
01:42:45,249 --> 01:42:46,250
You got to catch 'em in that slant

2376
01:42:46,291 --> 01:42:47,292
and let 'em over pursue.

2377
01:42:47,376 --> 01:42:48,585
He's onto your game.

2378
01:42:48,669 --> 01:42:51,964
You got to throw something
at him he's not ready for.

2379
01:42:52,005 --> 01:42:54,842
- Rev! Where's Rev?
- Yes, sir.

2380
01:42:54,925 --> 01:42:56,844
- All right, listen, you ready to run?
- Yes, sir.

2381
01:42:56,879 --> 01:42:59,429
Fake 23 blast...

2382
01:42:59,555 --> 01:43:01,223
with a backside George reverse.

2383
01:43:01,265 --> 01:43:03,142
You got that?
Fake 23 blast

2384
01:43:03,225 --> 01:43:04,560
with a backside
George reverse.

2385
01:43:04,601 --> 01:43:05,602
Like your life
depended upon it.

2386
01:43:05,686 --> 01:43:07,729
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go get 'em!

2387
01:43:07,855 --> 01:43:09,857
The Titans take the field

2388
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:13,569
with time to run one final play
for the state championship.

2389
01:43:13,694 --> 01:43:15,696
I thought he was injured.

2390
01:43:15,821 --> 01:43:17,156
I guess not.

2391
01:43:17,239 --> 01:43:19,158
Why are they bringing in a QB.?

2392
01:43:19,241 --> 01:43:20,701
The Titans have 75 yards

2393
01:43:20,742 --> 01:43:21,994
to get to the end zone.

2394
01:43:22,035 --> 01:43:24,329
Oh, my gosh.
I can't watch this.

2395
01:43:24,413 --> 01:43:25,998
I can't watch this. No.

2396
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:27,541
What? What?
Sheryl, what's wrong?

2397
01:43:27,583 --> 01:43:28,876
No, I can't watch it.

2398
01:43:28,917 --> 01:43:29,877
Sheryl!

2399
01:43:30,002 --> 01:43:32,337
No, it's too bad.
Not now. Not now.

2400
01:43:36,008 --> 01:43:38,343
They're gonna throw it deep.
Cover deep!

2401
01:43:38,427 --> 01:43:40,888
Watch the deep pass!
Cover it deep!

2402
01:43:41,013 --> 01:43:43,765
Ready! Set! Hut!

2403
01:44:01,492 --> 01:44:02,576
Yeah!

2404
01:44:02,618 --> 01:44:05,204
Yeah! Ha ha ha!

2405
01:44:25,349 --> 01:44:26,809
Well, that's it, boys.

2406
01:44:26,934 --> 01:44:27,976
That's it.

2407
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:29,520
Good season.

2408
01:44:29,603 --> 01:44:30,646
It's all right.

2409
01:44:30,771 --> 01:44:32,773
Yes! Yes!

2410
01:44:32,815 --> 01:44:33,941
Come on.

2411
01:44:37,986 --> 01:44:38,946
Congratulations, Coach.

2412
01:44:39,071 --> 01:44:40,239
All right.
Thank you, Coach.

2413
01:44:40,364 --> 01:44:41,532
You did a good job.
Played a fine game.

2414
01:44:42,991 --> 01:44:45,202
I know football,

2415
01:44:45,244 --> 01:44:47,287
but what you did
with those boys...

2416
01:44:47,371 --> 01:44:50,415
You were the right man
for the job, coach!

2417
01:44:50,541 --> 01:44:52,417
You're a Hall of Famer
in my book.

2418
01:44:57,256 --> 01:44:59,800
Yeah!

2419
01:45:00,968 --> 01:45:02,553
Mmm-ah! Whoo!

2420
01:45:02,594 --> 01:45:04,138
Yeah!

2421
01:45:04,263 --> 01:45:05,722
Yeah!

2422
01:45:05,806 --> 01:45:07,141
Whoo!
Hoo hoo hoo!

2423
01:45:09,393 --> 01:45:11,145
Yeah!

2424
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:12,396
Whoo!

2425
01:45:14,982 --> 01:45:17,985
Aah! Ha!

2426
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:21,446
The Titans
danced their way into history.

2427
01:45:21,572 --> 01:45:23,448
13 and 0, the perfect season.

2428
01:45:23,532 --> 01:45:25,450
State champions
and first runner-up

2429
01:45:25,534 --> 01:45:27,703
for the national championship.

2430
01:45:27,744 --> 01:45:29,621
Second-best high school team
in the country.

2431
01:45:29,705 --> 01:45:32,875
Gerry Bertier won a gold medal
for the shot put

2432
01:45:32,916 --> 01:45:34,418
in the wheel chair games.

2433
01:45:34,543 --> 01:45:36,712
Daddy coached him.

2434
01:45:36,753 --> 01:45:39,173
10 years later, Gerry died.

2435
01:45:39,298 --> 01:45:42,134
And that's what brought us
back here today.

2436
01:45:42,176 --> 01:45:46,054
Gerry is gone,
but his spirit lives on.

2437
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:49,016
People say that it can't work,
black and white.

2438
01:45:49,141 --> 01:45:51,727
Well, here we make it work
every day.

2439
01:45:51,852 --> 01:45:54,188
We have our disagreements,
of course.

2440
01:45:54,271 --> 01:45:56,273
But before we reach for hate,

2441
01:45:56,315 --> 01:45:59,776
always, always we remember
the Titans.

2442
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:08,785
# Hm hm hm hm #

2443
01:46:08,869 --> 01:46:12,456

# No matter how far #

2454
01:47:04,842 --> 01:47:06,301
# Don't worry, baby #

2455
01:47:06,385 --> 01:47:08,011
# Just call my name #

2456
01:47:08,095 --> 01:47:10,264
# I'll be there in a hurry #

2457
01:47:10,389 --> 01:47:11,974
# You don't have to worry #

2458
01:47:12,099 --> 01:47:13,357
# 'Cause baby there #

2459
01:47:13,392 --> 01:47:16,854

# Ain't no river wide enough #

2462
01:47:24,278 --> 01:47:27,030
# To keep me from gettin'
to you, baby #

2463
01:47:27,114 --> 01:47:28,615
# Remember the day #

2464
01:47:28,699 --> 01:47:30,242
# I set you free #

2465
01:47:30,284 --> 01:47:32,703
# I told you you could always #

2466
01:47:32,744 --> 01:47:34,121
# Count on me, darlin' #

2467
01:47:34,163 --> 01:47:36,290
# From that day on #

2468
01:47:36,415 --> 01:47:38,000
# I made a vow #

2469
01:47:38,125 --> 01:47:39,835
# I'll be there
when you want me #

2470
01:47:39,877 --> 01:47:41,587
# Some way, somehow #

2471
01:47:41,712 --> 01:47:43,005
# 'Cause baby there #

2472
01:47:43,046 --> 01:47:46,633
# Ain't no mountain high enough #

01:47:46,717 --> 01:47:50,429
# Ain't no valley low enough #
