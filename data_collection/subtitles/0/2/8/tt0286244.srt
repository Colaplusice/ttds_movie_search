00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,280
THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE

2
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,800
We apologize for this interruption...

3
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,640
Is the movie over?

4
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,720
Don't you want to tell grandma?

5
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,960
Is the movie over?

6
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,520
We now continue with
a musical interlude.

7
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,400
In this 17th stage
of the Tour de France

8
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,680
the pack, the machine of muscles
and steel, finally gets going.

9
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,400
But before the rubber tests the
overheated paving-stones of Marseille,

10
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,560
these young lads still have
many obstacles to face.

11
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,200
And a fantastic escape
by the yellow jersey,

12
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,440
who devours Klaut and Glutman
of the canned food factory from Frankfurt.

13
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,320
They'll have a hard time
catching up

14
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,480
on the spot where they already
failed miserably last year,

15
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,840
When they really had
to bite the bullet.

16
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,600
How admirable this fierce
endurance is

17
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,440
On the face of this great eagle.

18
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,080
The very top lies at
an altitude of 1912 metres,

19
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,040
the horrible Ventoux,
an impressive scenery

20
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,520
of white desert,
under a burning sun.

21
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,400
They climb standing on the pedals,

22
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,240
Constantly watching their gear ratio,
It is hell.

23
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,920
But before they reach the finish,

24
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,640
they work themselves into a sweat,

25
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,600
and leave behind that musky smell,

26
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,880
That supporters know so well.

27
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,480
The pack sink into oblivion.

28
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,080
For some the bell already sounds
And they give up.

29
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,880
Those who can not really pound the pedals,

30
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,560
lose pace, fall behind,

31
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,440
vanish into nothingness.

32
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,000
Together with a dazzling speed
comes the liberating descent

33
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,920
to Marseille.

34
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,160
Keep going, my boy!

35
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,080
Insurance company "The Pigeon"
gives away a whole weeks free insurance

36
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,160
for the best sprinter.

37
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,520
Yes, that's right, for free,
for his bicycle.

38
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,880
My box! That's my box!
Give me back my box!

39
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,320
Is that your dog?

40
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,160
I dont believe it! The nerve!

41
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,920
She now has my box and the dog!

42
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,400
Here, stuff this!

43
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,960
Dried tadpoles

44
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,760
Get out.

45
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,280
And now: The triplets of Belleville.

46
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,680
Another racers grave discovered.
Third in two months time

47
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,160
Sinister details

48
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,760
Investigation got stuck

49
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,640
French Mafia denies everything!

50
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:56,960
BELLEVILLE
Thank you for your visit - Goodbye

51
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,680
Is the movie over?

52
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,200
Don't you want to tell grandma?
Is the movie over?

53
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,400
It's finished, grandma.

54
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:30,480
For my parents.
