1
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
Fuck me, if he knows where we are.

2
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,700
You said it.

3
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,200
At least he hasn't led us to the enemy.

4
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,000
Guys, we'll wait until the fog lifts.

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's too risky to carry on.

6
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,000
With you, even drinking coffee is risky.

7
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,100
What a guide!

8
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,000
You try to do better in this fog!

9
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,100
Listen to him! He's always happy.

10
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,500
The eternal optimist.

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,500
Know the difference between
a pessimist and an optimist?

12
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,200
-No, what?
-A pessimist thinks things can't be worse.

13
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,800
An optimist knows they can.

14
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,800
You and your crap jokes.
No one else finds them funny.

15
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,100
If you had any brains at all, you'd give up.

16
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,800
Oh, yeah? If I had any, I wouldn't be here.

17
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,300
I'd be a general or a UN official.

18
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,600
Or I'd open a restaurant.
What's that look for?

19
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,700
It would help my budget
if you smoked your own.

20
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,900
-Since you're offering....
-Who the fuck am l? Mother Teresa?

21
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Are you crazy?

22
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,800
You want them to see us?

23
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,100
Who's going to see us?
I can't even see my feet.

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,800
Put those cigarettes out! Put them out!

25
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,500
Hair in place?

26
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,500
He's something else!

27
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,100
First time at the front
and he dozes off before we get there.

28
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,500
Kids these days....

29
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,800
What?

30
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,700
-Any idea where we are?
-I reckon we should be there by now.

31
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Dawn will soon be here and it'll be easier.

32
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I never took a relief squad
to the front at night before.

33
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,500
We got lucky....

34
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,900
Look!

35
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,200
Look!

36
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,700
Shit....

37
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,300
Run!

38
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,900
SERBlAN LlNES

39
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,900
You think they were trying
to take back the trench?

40
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
No, I don't think so.

41
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,200
-I think a relief squad got lost.
-Check it!

42
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,400
Yes, sir!

43
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,000
BOSNlAN LlNES

44
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,400
What happened?

45
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,700
Our relief squad got lost in the fog.

46
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,000
-Are there any survivors?
-Shit!

47
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,200
I'll alert HQ. Call me if there's any change.

48
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,900
-lf there's any change?
-Yes, if the dead start walking.

49
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,600
I need two volunteers
to inspect the middle trench.

50
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,800
You, the new guy. Go with him.

51
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,500
Him? He doesn't even know
how to load a gun.

52
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,900
Perfect. You can teach him.

53
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,700
Shit.

54
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,300
Cera!

55
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,400
You don't need this.
Nor this, nor this, nor this.

56
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,700
My name's Nino.

57
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,800
Here.

58
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,700
If you notice anything, come straight back.

59
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,300
What's wrong?

60
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,500
-You scared?
-No.

61
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,500
They've got the sun in their eyes,
they can't see you.

62
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,900
If there's trouble,
wait until dark to come back.

63
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,000
Fucking hell.

64
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,300
Follow me, do what I do
and don't try to be clever.

65
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,200
Good luck.

66
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,500
Don't touch anything.
It might be booby-trapped.

67
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,800
Make a fucking effort....

68
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,500
Stop here.

69
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,500
What are you doing?

70
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,200
Seeing as we have time,
let's have a little fun.

71
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,300
Look at it: "Made in EU."

72
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,000
My little baby.

73
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,300
What do you think it is?

74
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,700
-A mine.
-A bouncing mine!

75
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,100
When the enemy steps on it...

76
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,700
...what happens, according to you?

77
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,500
-lt explodes.
-No, nothing happens.

78
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,600
But when the enemy steps off it,
it bounces up...

79
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,300
...and explodes
about three feet off the ground...

80
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,300
...spraying out 2,000 lead bearings...

81
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,500
...that destroy everything
in a radius of 50 yards.

82
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,100
I'll show you.

83
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,800
Move this son of a bitch.

84
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,300
Gently.

85
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,200
Careful with the pin.

86
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,900
Lay the body down slowly,
otherwise you get blown up.

87
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,500
Go on, tug the wire now.

88
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,800
Me? Why me?

89
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,400
Go on, don't worry,
as long as there's a weight....

90
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,900
Do it gently, that's all.

91
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,700
I can't.

92
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,700
Chicken!

93
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,900
See that?

94
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,900
I invented this.

95
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,600
When they pick up the body
the mine will blow them all to hell.

96
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,800
-What's your name again?
-Nino.

97
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
You'll set the next one.

98
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,700
He looks asleep.

99
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,500
That's because he's still fresh.
It won't last in this heat.

100
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,200
Try to sleep. We'll leave once it's dark.

101
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,200
Afterwards, we'll set more of these babies.

102
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,200
Where's that gun?

103
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,100
What gun?

104
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,600
Where does this trench lead?

105
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,900
Where does the trench lead?

106
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,100
Where does the trench lead?

107
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Outside.

108
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,300
-Really? Where, outside?
-lnto the field.

109
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,900
Is it mined?

110
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,000
Where does the other one lead?

111
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,600
-I don't know.
-You don't know anything?

112
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,600
Fuck....

113
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,200
Don't touch that! Get back!

114
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,900
-How did you get here?
-We crawled.

115
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,000
Across the field? You're lying!

116
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,500
I'm not. Your side was blinded by the sun.

117
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,200
-And the mines?
-I don't know. He knew.

118
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,600
Where's the map?

119
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,700
-What map?
-Of Bolivia, stupid. Of the mines!

120
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,200
-Empty your pockets.
-Why?

121
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,200
Because I have a gun and you don't.
Come on.

122
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,700
Is that all?

123
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,300
Strip.

124
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
-What?
-Strip.

125
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,600
Why?

126
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,200
Are you stupid, or what?
Because I have a gun and you don't.

127
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,200
You may not have noticed,
but I'm in charge here.

128
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,500
I'm starving.

129
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,800
You're always starving.

130
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,700
-What's up?
-You have to see this.

131
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,100
What now?

132
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,300
-What the hell's that?
-ls he ours?

133
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,100
It's not written on his boxers.
Call the officer.

134
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,000
-What do I tell him?
-That the dead are walking.

135
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,300
Okay. Get down here.

136
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
You hear me? Come down.

137
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,800
He wasn't ours?

138
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,900
I've no idea. I only saw him for a second.

139
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,900
What a hawk-eye.

140
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Let's not take any risks.

141
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,200
Hello. Put me through to the artillery.

142
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,200
-I can't see anything.
-He saw him, too.

143
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,400
-One of ours?
-God knows. He only had boxer shorts on.

144
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Any other brilliant ideas?

145
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,000
If you piss me off, you go back out there.

146
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,300
They've stopped.

147
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,800
Sure. Yours never stop.

148
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,600
How about yours? Do they ever stop?

149
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,800
You can't compare.
We didn't start the war.

150
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,500
And maybe we did?

151
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,300
No! The Khmer Rouge!
All you can do is make war.

152
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,900
-Us?
-No, you're pacifists.

153
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,300
The Great Serbia,
all the way to the Pacific!

154
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,100
Please. The whole world thinks like me.

155
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,400
What world? Your world!

156
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,100
You show our burned villages
and say they're yours.

157
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,200
And that's my side shooting now?

158
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,400
You're all saints. Give it a rest.

159
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,300
You don't even leave the dead in peace.

160
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,400
It's not the same.

161
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,300
Really? Laying mines under the dead,
pillaging, killing, raping, what's all that?

162
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,000
-Who are you talking about?
-You guys!

163
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,300
I haven't seen anything like what you say.

164
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,800
I've seen it! I saw my village burn.

165
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,500
-I don't know. I wasn't there.
-I was!

166
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,900
Haven't our villages burned, too?
Who killed our people?

167
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,200
Your side, probably.
They just shot at you, too.

168
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,300
They only shot at me
because they didn't recognize me.

169
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,700
It's useless talking to you.

170
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,100
What the hell made you ruin
this beautiful country?

171
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,200
-Us?
-Yes!

172
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,800
You're crazy.
You wanted to separate, not us.

173
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,300
Because you started the war!

174
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,900
-You started it!
-What? Who started it?

175
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,200
You started the war! You started it!

176
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,200
Who started the war?

177
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,500
-We did.
-You started the war.

178
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,100
And stop pissing me off.
You're getting on my nerves.

179
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,000
Get out! Come on, get out of here!

180
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,300
Fuck.

181
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,900
Daring to say it was us.

182
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,600
What was all that?

183
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,500
I'll alert HQ. Call me if there's any change.

184
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,400
-What now?
-Nothing. We wait till dark.

185
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,300
And then?

186
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,500
Then, if you survive,
we'll crawl over to the lines.

187
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,100
And stop bothering me.

188
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,400
-So you're not going to free me.
-Dream on.

189
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,500
Cera, you're alive!

190
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,300
Don't move!

191
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,500
Don't move!

192
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,700
There's a mine under you.
It could explode.

193
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,800
-What mine?
-A bounding one. Don't move.

194
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,400
-Are you kidding me?
-Do I look like I'm kidding?

195
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,400
Come here. Defuse it.

196
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,100
-You hear me? Defuse it!
-I don't know how.

197
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,400
Don't fool around. Defuse it!
I'm going to kill you! Defuse it!

198
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,000
If I try, I'll kill us all.

199
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,900
Fuck. What is this shit?

200
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,500
Ciki, what's happening?

201
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,700
They laid a mine under you
to ambush our guys.

202
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,100
Only they could think of that!

203
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,800
Kill him.

204
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,500
Kill the son of a bitch.

205
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,800
Kill him or give me the gun!

206
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
No.

207
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,100
We're not like them.

208
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,800
Besides, he could be useful.
Bring the water over.

209
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,900
I can't give you too much.
I don't know where you're wounded.

210
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,600
Where does it hurt?

211
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,400
My head and my arm.
My head's going to burst.

212
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,000
That's because of the detonation.
I'm the same. Hold on.

213
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,800
What about the others?

214
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,200
Don't let me die here.

215
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,700
Don't worry. Does it hurt anywhere else?

216
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,800
No.

217
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,400
You lucky bastard.
You're unharmed. Just your arm.

218
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,900
And I thought you were dead.

219
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,500
Can l....

220
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,400
Throw the gun down.
Don't make me shoot. Throw it down!

221
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,900
Get up.

222
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,200
Back off.

223
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,400
Back off!

224
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,100
See what you've done! Get back!

225
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,800
What now?

226
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,300
Now, we wait for dark.

227
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,500
I have to dress his wound.

228
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,300
Okay, but nice and easy.

229
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,500
If you fuck about...

230
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,000
...I'll shoot without warning, you hear me?

231
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,700
Let me see your hands!

232
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,300
I told you to kill him.

233
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,300
Shut up.

234
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,300
What are you saying?
Throw the knife away.

235
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,600
Throw the knife away!

236
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,100
Back off.

237
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,100
Give me those.

238
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,300
Can I have one?

239
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,900
Why?

240
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,700
Because I have a gun and you don't.

241
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,500
-Sit down.
-We have to help him.

242
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,600
Sit down!

243
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,600
By the way, who started the war?

244
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,000
Who started the war?

245
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,600
We did.

246
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,300
-You started the war.
-Who cares who started it?

247
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,300
We're all in the same shit now.

248
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,800
Can I have a cigarette?

249
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,300
What are you doing?

250
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,000
-Don't move.
-Hold on!

251
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,500
-Put the gun down.
-Calm down!

252
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,300
-Put it down!
-lf I do, he'll kill me!

253
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,000
-lf you don't, we're fucked.
-No!

254
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,600
I won't kill you, I promise.

255
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
-No.
-Put the gun down.

256
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,300
Calm down. Gently. Wait!

257
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,000
Okay....

258
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,600
Okay, he takes the gun, but I keep mine.

259
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,500
Ciki, take the gun.

260
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,000
Slowly.

261
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,200
Okay.

262
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,900
Put it on your shoulder.

263
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,300
Put it on your shoulder!

264
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,300
Okay.

265
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,100
Don't move.

266
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,100
Put yours on your shoulder, too!

267
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,900
There, we're equal now.

268
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,100
Here, for your head.

269
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,000
Cut it out. Calm down.

270
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,900
I'm fucking sick of this.

271
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,700
What now?

272
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,700
I have an idea.

273
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,700
So do l. First, give me the cigarettes.

274
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,400
What is it?

275
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,000
-What's wrong?
-Fuck!

276
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,800
What a mess in Rwanda.

277
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,900
You're really nuts.

278
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,900
I don't believe it.

279
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,100
-What is it?
-There's two of them now.

280
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,500
-What are they yelling about?
-Call the officer.

281
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,500
Unbelievable.

282
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,400
It's this morning's greenhorn.

283
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,700
Call the UNPROFOR for me.

284
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,600
I've never seen anything like it.

285
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,000
We ought to call the UNPROFOR.

286
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,000
I'll alert HQ.

287
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,600
I hope those aren't my cigarettes.

288
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,600
When I took them,
I didn't think you'd need them.

289
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,500
But now I hope...

290
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,300
...that you'll die of cancer.

291
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,800
Okay?

292
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,500
You know what?

293
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,600
Maybe you shouldn't smoke today.

294
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,000
Everything okay?

295
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,600
You haven't told me your name.
My name's Nino.

296
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,600
What's your problem?
You want what? An introduction?

297
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,200
To exchange phone numbers
and visiting cards?

298
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,100
We don't need an introduction.

299
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,000
Next time we see each other,
it'll be through a gun's sight.

300
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,300
What's wrong with him?

301
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,400
Keep an eye on him.

302
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,600
It's for you.

303
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,600
Call Arizona 2.

304
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,700
Charlie Tango to Arizona 2, over.
Do you copy? Over.

305
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,600
Arizona 2. I copy. Over.

306
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,300
I have your report.
Are they civilians or military?

307
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,400
We do not have that information.
Request permission to check.

308
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,900
Negative! We must be sure
of the Sira-Bravo cease-fire, okay?

309
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,900
Affirmative. Over.

310
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,400
Do you know how many
need to be evacuated?

311
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,900
Negative. Over.

312
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,200
Arizona 2, stay where you are.
I'll talk to my superiors.

313
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,500
Message received. Clear.

314
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,100
-Why the fuck are we here?
-Good question.

315
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:10,200
I reckon it's simple:
to stop the locals killing each other.

316
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,900
Except we can't use force
or get into dangerous situations.

317
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
I'm sick of just watching.

318
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,400
Right, let's go.

319
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,800
-Georges, stay here.
-We can't leave like this.

320
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,900
Stay if you want
and figure out why you're here.

321
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,200
Don't fall asleep, you might move.

322
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,100
How can I fall asleep...

323
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,300
...with this shit under me?

324
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,400
Fuck, why is this happening to me?

325
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:14,400
We'll find a solution.
Try to think of something else.

326
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,600
Ciki....

327
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,000
Don't let me die here.

328
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,300
Listen, I'm staying here with you.

329
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,700
If you die, I die too.

330
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,900
What a comfort!

331
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,800
Come on.

332
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,800
I'll check what's happening.

333
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,900
SERBlAN BARRlCADE

334
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,300
Hello.

335
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
-Do you speak French?
-French? No.

336
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,500
-English?
-Yes.

337
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,600
-We came for people.
-Yes.

338
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,700
-People, you know?
-Yes.

339
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,600
People between lines.

340
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,900
-Where are they?
-Yes.

341
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,300
Okay, you understand nothing
of what I've said.

342
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,200
Yes.

343
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,400
You speak English?

344
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,700
No.

345
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,800
French?

346
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,400
We are here for people between lines.

347
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,400
-What's he saying?
-God knows, just say yes, yes.

348
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,400
Does anyone here know languages?

349
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,700
We are here, this place.

350
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,100
Where are the men?

351
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,100
Here? Here people?

352
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,000
Soldiers?

353
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,200
-Any mine?
-No mine.

354
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,400
-You sure?
-No mine.

355
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,400
We go now.

356
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,100
Okay? We go, you don't shoot.

357
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,000
Shoot, no. Nobody shoots.

358
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,500
-Yeah.
-Okay, thank you.

359
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,900
Tell HQ the UNPROFOR is here.

360
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,900
I don't want anybody shooting.
Is that clear?

361
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,400
-Sorry about earlier.
-You were right.

362
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,200
Why get acquainted
to watch each other through sights?

363
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,100
-ln any case, thanks for the idea.
-Let's hope it works.

364
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,000
What's going on? Think they understood?

365
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,800
-How is he?
-How do you expect him to be?

366
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,300
-Have you known him long?
-Since the war.

367
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,500
Since the beginning of this fucking war.

368
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,900
What about you and the old man?

369
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,200
I don't even know his name.

370
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,400
You're from Banja Luka.

371
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,200
How do you know? Yeah, right.

372
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,000
I had a chick in Banja Luka. Sanja.

373
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,800
I knew a Sanja, too.

374
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,400
-She had....
-This one, too.

375
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,700
-Blonde.
-Yes.

376
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,800
-Tall.
-Yes.

377
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,500
With a beauty spot.

378
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
-Sanja Cengic!
-I was at school with her.

379
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,700
-No kidding?
-I swear.

380
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,900
-Cera!
-Yeah.

381
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,500
He knows the Sanja I mentioned!

382
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,500
Brilliant.

383
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,800
What's become of her?

384
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,000
She's gone abroad.

385
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,600
I don't blame her.

386
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,800
BOSNlAN BARRlCADE

387
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,000
-Hello. Do you speak French?
-No, English.

388
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,200
-Okay, we are here for people....
-Yes, we called. You can go.

389
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,100
-It's okay? We go?
-Go.

390
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,700
-Any mines there?
-We didn't put any.

391
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,300
Okay. Go ahead.

392
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,600
-Sarajevo on line.
-Hello, Col. Soft speaking.

393
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,300
-Hello, sir. This is Capt. Dubois.
-How can I help you?

394
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,400
It's the first time that the two camps
are asking me for the same thing...

395
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,300
...and I don't know what to do.

396
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,600
Why are you asking me
and not your superiors?

397
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,100
They are all in Geneva
for a seminar on media relations.

398
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,200
It seems from your report that these men...

399
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,100
...are stranded between the two front lines.

400
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,500
But we don't even know
if they are soldiers or not. Is that right?

401
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,600
What do you expect me to do?

402
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,400
I can't risk the lives of our soldiers
in order to save theirs.

403
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,400
Do I have to remind you of the precise
purpose of our mission here in Bosnia?

404
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,000
Since it is the first time
that the two camps are--

405
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,200
You know perfectly well
that there is nothing that I can do...

406
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,600
...without the approval of the General
Assembly of the United Nations.

407
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,500
I don't think the General Assembly
will convene itself...

408
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,700
...specifically to deal with the problems
of two unknown individuals...

409
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,400
...trapped in no man's land.

410
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,300
There is nothing I can do.
I don't have the authority.

411
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,100
What should I tell them, sir?

412
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,800
Tell them that, as usual,
neither side can agree.

413
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,000
Tell them anything you like. Good-bye.

414
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,400
Is someone coming?

415
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,300
Probably. See, they've stopped shooting.

416
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,700
Fuck.

417
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,400
I don't even know
what this shithole's called.

418
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,200
-I'd hate to die here.
-Stop being a pain in the ass.

419
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,000
They'll get a mine expert
and it'll soon be over.

420
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,300
I told you, we'll leave together.

421
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,600
Here come the Smurfs! Cera!
The Smurfs!

422
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,400
If they radio us, call me immediately.

423
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,900
What if something happens to you?

424
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,800
-Hello.
-Hello.

425
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,400
-Do you speak French?
-No.

426
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,900
-English?
-A little.

427
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,600
One's a Serb and one's Bosnian.

428
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,700
How did they get here?

429
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,800
-Do we take the dead guys' guns?
-No, it's okay.

430
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,300
-You're okay?
-Yes, okay.

431
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,100
We come to help you. My name is Neil.

432
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,500
He needs help.

433
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,800
-ls he wounded?
-Yes.

434
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,200
We must not move him. Mines.

435
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,300
We move him, mine explode.

436
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,800
-He's on a mine that could blow.
-Thanks for the translation.

437
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,400
What the fuck happened here?

438
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,400
-Okay, don't worry.
-Yes, but....

439
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,200
Stop!

440
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,800
Oh, shit.

441
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,200
A bouncing mine. These guys are crazy.

442
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,800
What a fuck-up. We need the mine squad.

443
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,200
Sarge! Charlie Tango calling.

444
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,600
Okay, I'll come back in two minutes.

445
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,900
Michel, give them water and food.

446
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,200
What did he say?

447
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,800
Arizona 2 to Charlie Tango, come in.

448
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,300
Arizona 2, we have orders not to move.
Things are too risky.

449
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,600
We're already on the spot.
Everything's under control.

450
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,300
Both sides are respecting the cease-fire.

451
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,700
We have three evacuees
and need a mine expert.

452
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,900
Who's speaking?

453
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,200
Sgt. Marchand.

454
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,000
You have 5 minutes to pull out...

455
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,700
...and 15 to call me from the checkpoint.

456
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,700
And report to the duty officer
on your return!

457
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,700
Sir, could you send a mine squad?
We have an emergency here.

458
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,100
The only emergency is to pull out.

459
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:11,600
I repeat, for the last time,
I want you out in 5 minutes...

460
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,100
...and call me in 15 to confirm...

461
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:17,000
...that you're back
and that your men are safe.

462
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,800
Or I'll have you arrested.
I'll be expecting your call.

463
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,400
Idiot!

464
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,800
Get back in.

465
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,800
What for?

466
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,800
We must leave.

467
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,400
-What?
-They're leaving.

468
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,800
-You'll come back?
-I don't know, my boss said we must leave.

469
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,800
I'm sorry. I'll try to come back.

470
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,100
Thank God we can count on you.

471
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,500
If you want, I take you with me.

472
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,900
-What?
-We can go with him.

473
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,600
Really? Thank him nicely
and tell him he can fuck off!

474
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,800
-Ciki, go.
-Shut up.

475
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,800
Go and bring back help.

476
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,100
Wait!

477
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,700
I'll come with you.

478
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,100
-Where are you going?
-With them.

479
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,400
-You're going nowhere!
-Why?

480
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,800
This is all your fault.
If you stay, your side won't shoot.

481
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
-They won't shoot, I swear.
-You're staying here.

482
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,900
You're going to shoot me? Go ahead!

483
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,700
Stop fooling around!

484
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,600
No!

485
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,300
Stop, guys!

486
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,300
Okay! Cool! Stop!

487
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,100
Lower your weapons!

488
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,100
Michel, get in!

489
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,000
What happened?

490
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,300
-What a fuck-up.
-They're maniacs!

491
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,100
Shut it!

492
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,600
-I knew this would be shitty.
-Shut it!

493
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,400
-You're crazy, you maniac!
-I warned you.

494
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,800
I'll kill you for this! I swear!

495
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,500
I've fucking had it with you.

496
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,800
Keep cool just a while longer. Screw them.

497
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,700
It'll be dark soon
and I'll think of something.

498
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,200
How does this shit work?

499
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,500
I'm sick of asking you!

500
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,300
Fuck knows!

501
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:38,100
It explodes
when you take the weight away.

502
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Here we are at a Bosnian barricade
near the town of Tuzla...

503
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,100
...talking to the Bosnian Commander.

504
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,900
How do you feel about the talks in Geneva?

505
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,000
I'd like to go there.
Would you go with me?

506
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,600
Are you resentful that people are talking
while you are suffering?

507
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,100
What happened?

508
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,000
It's very confused.
We go now and bring some help.

509
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,600
-Why don't you tell them the truth?
-Who are you?

510
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,900
I am Jane Livingston,
Global News Channel...

511
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:16,900
...and this is Sgt. Marchand,
otherwise known as Arizona 2.

512
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,400
Stop the engine.

513
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,900
-How do you know that?
-We were listening to your radio frequency.

514
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:27,000
Since we were in the area,
we thought we'd come and verify.

515
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,400
-You listened to our radio?
-Absolutely.

516
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,800
It's the best way to get fresh information.

517
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:36,000
Are you going back?
Why do you need a bomb disposal unit?

518
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,500
Stop the camera.

519
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,500
-Can you take us there?
-No, I have to go.

520
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,200
That's right.

521
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:47,700
You're just here to distribute
humanitarian aid.

522
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,100
Okay, we'll go without you.
Come on, let's go.

523
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,800
You can't. It's too dangerous.

524
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,700
Is that an order?

525
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,300
Okay, stop filming, please.

526
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,400
Please?

527
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,700
Yes, all right.

528
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,000
Maybe I can help you if you'll help me.

529
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,000
We have an English TV crew here.

530
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,100
They know everything.

531
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,200
Other crews are on the way.
They picked up our frequency.

532
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,800
I didn't answer their questions.

533
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,100
Hello, Captain.
This is Jane Livingston of Global News.

534
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,900
I can hear everything you're saying.

535
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,600
Are we to assume that the UNPROFOR
are doing absolutely nothing...

536
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,800
...for those who are wounded
and trapped between the two fronts?

537
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,700
Who made this decision?
Are headquarters aware of the situation?

538
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,500
You know very well that you have no right
to listen or to use this frequency.

539
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,900
Get off it immediately
or we'll confiscate your press card. Over.

540
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,800
Is that a threat?

541
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,300
Listen, Miss Livingston,
I was not in any way threatening you.

542
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,500
Please, try to understand.
We are doing what we can.

543
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:15,300
At this moment we are in negotiations
with both camps to arrange a ceasefire.

544
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:19,200
As you know, the situation
is extremely complicated and takes time.

545
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,700
That's a lie.

546
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,200
Can you tell me where these negotiations
are and who's in charge?

547
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,600
I have my second unit on hand here
who could cover it immediately.

548
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,100
I have no more information
for the moment.

549
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,300
You're telling me
that negotiations are taking place...

550
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,100
...but you don't know where they are
or who's in charge.

551
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,700
At the same time...

552
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:42,200
...you've requested that your soldiers
who were on the scene return to base.

553
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,500
I just carry out orders.

554
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,900
Who issues these orders?
Can I have a name?

555
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,700
I cannot disclose military affairs.

556
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,300
First of all, I must request authorization
from my superiors.

557
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,600
Fine, go ahead.
I'll wait right here for your answer.

558
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,700
I'm preparing a news report
which goes off in half an hour...

559
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,400
...and it will be fascinating
to monitor the response...

560
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,000
...of millions of our viewers
who will watch the show.

561
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,500
Thank you, Captain.

562
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,800
Arizona 2, are you still there?

563
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,400
Affirmative, Charlie Tango.

564
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,000
Stay there until further orders.
Over and out.

565
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,400
Message received, sir.

566
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,700
-Could l--
-No, please, not now.

567
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,700
Why are you doing this?

568
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,900
I'm sick of being a bystander.

569
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,600
-What would you do?
-What I'd do?

570
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,400
I'd stop the madmen ruining this country.
We have what it takes.

571
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,700
Aren't you neutral?

572
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,900
You can't be neutral facing murder.

573
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,500
Doing nothing to stop it is taking sides.

574
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,200
Magnificent. Will you say that on camera?

575
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,700
I may be mad, but I'm not stupid.

576
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,600
-Jane.
-Yeah, I'm coming.

577
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,800
I'll be right back.

578
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,000
-What's wrong?
-My leg's itching.

579
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,100
Wait.

580
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:24,100
You want to blow us away?
I'll scratch you.

581
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,200
Lower.

582
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,300
Again. To the left.

583
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,000
There. That's good.

584
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,200
I need the toilet.

585
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,400
Piss in your pants.

586
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,800
It's the other.

587
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,900
It's okay.

588
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,700
Easy for you to say.

589
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,800
Here at the Bosnian barricade...

590
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,900
...we do not know if this is yet another
mission impossible...

591
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,400
...or if, indeed, they will actually decide
to do something.

592
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,100
Thank you, Jane.

593
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:14,800
Let's take a look at the history
of UN involvement in the Bosnian conflict.

594
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,100
Martha, get me Capt. Dubois, please.

595
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
He just called,
but I told him that you were out.

596
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,300
Call him back and tell him I'm here.

597
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:31,300
You're pushing Bosnia-Herzegovina...

598
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:35,600
...to follow the same path
of horror and suffering...

599
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,700
...as Slovenia and Croatia.

600
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,200
You'll lead Bosnia into hell
and this may end up...

601
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,000
...exterminating the Muslim people!

602
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:48,100
Radovan Karadzic didn't wait long
to carry out his threat.

603
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,700
Bosnian Serb paramilitary forces,
largely helped by the Yugoslav army...

604
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,600
...furiously attacked Bosnian cities...

605
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,600
...that were defended only
by armed Bosnian civilians...

606
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,000
...and the rest of the police forces
loyal to the Bosnian government.

607
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,100
Serbs started massive attacks
against civilian targets...

608
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:08,600
...spreading fear and terror and introducing
a new term: ethnical cleansing.

609
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,700
The world community
finally decided to do something...

610
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,700
...after Serb artillery massacred people
waiting in lines for bread.

611
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,600
UN Security Council
decided to send to Bosnia...

612
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,900
...9,000 troops supported by
the American 6th Fleet.

613
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:26,000
At the moment when the whole world
expected military intervention...

614
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,500
...French President Franois Mitterrand
lands in Sarajevo...

615
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,800
...a city that was already under siege.

616
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:35,700
Bosnians received him as a savior,
but he had different plans.

617
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:40,000
After meeting with Radovan Karadzic,
he opened Sarajevo airport...

618
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,300
...and started wide-scale
humanitarian aid action.

619
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,400
UN troops were assigned to protect
and follow the UNHCR food convoys...

620
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,200
...without any right to interfere
in the conflict.

621
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,400
Today, Bosnians are still denied
the right to defend themselves...

622
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,500
...by an imposed UN weapon embargo...

623
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:02,300
...although, at this very moment, war
continues without any signs of pacification.

624
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,400
The tragedy
of the Bosnian nation continues...

625
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:10,500
...and the only help they've got now
is 120 grams of humanitarian aid per day.

626
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,600
For those joining us now,
we have news from Bosnia...

627
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,600
...where some men
are caught in no man's land.

628
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,500
Our correspondent
Jane Livingston is there.

629
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,500
We're waiting to see which measure
will be taken by UNPROFOR.

630
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,700
Is there anything you'd like to add, Jane?

631
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:28,100
Olivia, I would like to repeat the words
that I heard here only moments ago.

632
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,000
"Neutrality does not exist
in the face of murder.

633
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,300
"Doing nothing to stop it is,
in fact, choosing.

634
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,500
"It is not being neutral. "

635
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,400
Thank you, Jane.
We'll come back to you later.

636
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:45,000
That was Jane Livingston, live from Bosnia.
We'll be back after this.

637
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:55,100
Martha, gonna need a helicopter
and a map of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

638
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:59,500
How was it? We haven't had an
opportunity like that in a very long time.

639
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,400
Yeah.

640
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,300
I know. I just hope it will make them
move their asses, you know?

641
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,100
Yeah. That's right.

642
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,800
Okay. I'll call you as soon as we get there.

643
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,800
Shit! We weren't the only ones listening
to the UNPROFOR, obviously.

644
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,500
Hi, John.

645
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,900
Okay, guys. We have the go-ahead.

646
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,100
Stay here while we check things.

647
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,000
Come on. That's not what we agreed.

648
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:32,000
It's too dangerous now.
You can move in with the mine expert.

649
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,400
No! You said that you would take us up....

650
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,500
Fucking French.

651
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,300
Really, I'm sick of it.

652
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:55,400
Give me the photo in my pocket.

653
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,800
-Which pocket?
-The top one.

654
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,800
This one.

655
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,500
Let me see.

656
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,700
-Why do soldiers always carry photos?
-I've no idea. Let me see.

657
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,700
I can't see like that.

658
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:30,400
-Think I'll see her again?
-Cut it out, of course you will.

659
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,100
Ciki!

660
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,800
Stop it, for God's sake!

661
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,900
Shit!

662
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,900
You stop!

663
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,600
Watch the knife!

664
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,600
Stop now!

665
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:55,600
It's over! You stop! Help is coming.

666
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:00,100
The mining squad is coming.
You understand? You tell him.

667
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,100
The mine squad's coming!

668
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,800
I'll kill you for this!

669
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,300
It's good for you.

670
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,000
Help coming.

671
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,500
I'll get reinforcements.
Keep an eye on them...

672
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,700
...and clean his wound.

673
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:32,200
Take this. Call me if there's a problem.

674
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:53,500
-What's happening?
-Okay, you'll be able to film.

675
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,400
Are you sure?

676
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,000
Everything okay? Are you all right?

677
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,900
-Sgt. Marchand.
-Capt. Dubois.

678
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:12,200
-Captain, can you tell us what's going on?
-Just one moment, please.

679
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:15,800
-Can we have an interview later?
-I told you, one minute.

680
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,900
-What's going on?
-A hell of a mess, sir.

681
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,600
It's really tense. We just had to intervene.

682
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:25,100
We're taking no risks.
Any trouble, we pull out, okay?

683
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,700
-What about the reporters?
-We let them film everything.

684
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,500
Isn't that what you wanted?

685
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,800
I'm not stupid, Sgt. Marchand.

686
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:41,700
Ladies and gentleman, I am Capt. Dubois.

687
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:45,000
In a few minutes,
I will take you on the site.

688
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,500
I suppose you all have your press cards,
helmets and flak jackets.

689
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,600
Sgt. Marchand here
is going to brief you now.

690
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:56,800
We have there a soldier that is laying
on a mine. We have to de-mine it.

691
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,200
Nobody can go in the hole.
It's too dangerous.

692
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,300
Don't go around because
we don't know if there are any mines.

693
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:09,600
The situation is extremely complicated
and I want your total cooperation.

694
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,300
Whoever will not respect the rules...

695
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:15,400
...will be thrown out
and their press card will be confiscated.

696
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,000
Go now into your cars.
We'll leave in a few minutes.

697
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,300
Please go.

698
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,900
-You never mentioned a man on a mine.
-I didn't?

699
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,100
I forgot. Shall we go?

700
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,300
-We wait for the mine expert.
-He isn't with you?

701
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,900
Ours were busy.
They're sending a German.

702
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:42,300
He should be here at 3:30. It's 3:30 now.

703
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,200
Bang on the dot.

704
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,400
What?

705
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,700
Capt. Dubois. Do you speak French?

706
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:58,500
No.

707
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,400
-English, of course.
-Of course.

708
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,400
-You know the situation?
-No, we had no time for a briefing.

709
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,500
We don't have much time,
so you follow us, I will explain you.

710
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,400
Over there. Follow us.

711
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:30,600
At this very moment the UNPROFOR
are trying to help the third soldier...

712
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,000
...who is lying on a mine.

713
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,400
The absurdity of war continues,
taking on a different guise.

714
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,900
How will all this end?
Stay tuned to Global News.

715
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:41,400
Jane Livingston, live from Bosnia.

716
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,800
Here.

717
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,300
Excuse me...

718
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,300
...can I make interview with you?

719
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:03,400
Go fuck yourself!
You're the last thing I need.

720
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,300
Fucking Balkanian.
What the fuck are you doing?

721
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:11,900
-I just thought--
-Don't think.

722
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,700
I'm the one who thinks around here.

723
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,800
Excuse me, would you like a cigarette?

724
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,600
Do you speak a little English?

725
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,600
-Little.
-I can do interview with you?

726
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,500
Roll.

727
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,100
-How do you feel?
-Okay.

728
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,200
-Do you feel tired?
-Yes.

729
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:49,000
Was it you who put the mine
underneath the other soldier?

730
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,600
Fucking bastard. Cut!

731
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I'll kill him, even if it's the last thing I do.

732
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,700
-What's wrong with you?
-I should have killed him.

733
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,300
See that? I spared him and now...

734
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,400
...he's tried to kill me with my own knife!

735
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,700
How do you feel?

736
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,800
Great. Couldn't be better.

737
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:43,900
First, they shoot at me,
then I wake up on a mine...

738
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,500
...the whole world's watching me,
I need to shit...

739
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:51,000
...and you piss me off
with your stupid stories.

740
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,000
It'll soon be over.

741
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,400
-You are okay?
-Yes, I'm ready.

742
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,800
Now, I need everybody out of the place.

743
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:15,000
We need the safety parameters
at least 30 meters.

744
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,800
Okay. I'll do it.

745
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,300
Move everybody out.

746
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:38,100
Okay, please, now, you must go back.
We will start de-mining.

747
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,900
Michel, let's get going!

748
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,000
You must leave now.
De-miner wants everybody out.

749
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,400
You, out.

750
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:58,900
Yes, he out, too.
Later, when we finish. Understand?

751
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,400
They'll bring him out later.

752
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,400
If I need a translator, I'll find one.

753
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,600
Let's go.

754
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:11,900
Calm down!

755
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:13,400
You cannot stay here, okay?

756
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,400
Tell him if he stays here
we will not start working.

757
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,000
It's a question of security.
Say it to your friend.

758
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,300
He's not my friend.

759
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,200
I know, but please,
I have no other translator. Tell him.

760
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:31,700
-They'll do nothing until we go.
-I don't need a translator!

761
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,600
Go fuck yourself, asshole!

762
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,400
Keep your cool. Just go.

763
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:48,000
I'll wait for you up there.

764
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,900
Keep an eye on him.

765
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,300
Okay?

766
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:02,600
You can probably just make out
behind me, as I'm speaking to you...

767
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:07,400
...the Serbian soldier, limping,
closely followed by the Bosnian soldier.

768
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,200
These two men, at least,
will be walking to their safety.

769
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,800
But they will be leaving behind
the third soldier...

770
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:16,500
...who is still patiently waiting
on the mine...

771
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,400
...for the bomb-disposal expert
to save his life.

772
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,000
For him, the ordeal is not yet over.

773
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:25,400
This is Jane Livingston, live from Bosnia...

774
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,800
...for Global News. Stay tuned.

775
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,700
Get lost!

776
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:49,500
Fuck you!

777
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:57,300
Asshole! I give him bandages
and he refuses them.

778
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,700
They're all maniacs!

779
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,600
-It's John here. Are you still there?
-Yes. Hello?

780
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:11,700
Okay. Listen, this is really great,
but it would be fantastic if you could...

781
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,100
...get the story of the guy on the mine.

782
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:15,800
I'll try. I mean....

783
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:20,700
Maybe you could get a close-up of him
when they're clearing the mine?

784
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,100
Yeah, I'll try.

785
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:26,100
Have you interviewed
the other two guys yet?

786
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:29,500
No, unfortunately they won't let me
get anywhere near them.

787
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,800
Go get it, Jane. Come on!

788
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:35,300
As soon as you get it, we'll go live again.
Okay? Good luck.

789
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,900
Thank you.

790
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,400
Don't move.

791
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,700
Fuck, what a job.

792
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,000
They say a mine expert
only ever makes one mistake.

793
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,900
-Two mistakes.
-How come?

794
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,800
The first is when he chooses the job.

795
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,600
What is happening?

796
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:03,000
There's too much stones.
I can't approach the mine.

797
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:06,300
I don't even see what kind of mine it is.

798
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,800
I know. Wait.

799
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,100
-ls this the mine that is under the body?
-Yeah.

800
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,700
I can do nothing.

801
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,700
-What?
-It's impossible to de-activate...

802
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,600
...this kind of stuff
once the mechanism is on.

803
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,900
This man is already dead.

804
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,900
Are you sure? Can't you put something
between him and the mine?

805
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,200
Maybe another de-miner knows better.

806
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,100
You can call whoever you want.

807
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:59,000
Nobody, nothing in the world can de-mine
this stuff, not in these conditions.

808
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,200
At least I don't know about it.

809
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,600
Deus ex machina. He's all we needed.

810
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:58,700
Why are you here? Do you consider it
such an important mission?

811
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,300
We consider all our missions
to be of the utmost importance.

812
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:05,900
Our job here is to expedite
the peace process in this country.

813
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,900
You didn't want to intervene.
It was your soldiers...

814
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:13,300
...who were sick and tired of waiting,
who initiated the action.

815
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,700
I'm afraid you got
the wrong end of the story here.

816
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:19,800
This is a simple new system of command.

817
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
If it's effective, then the unit in the field
will have much greater mobility.

818
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,900
What do you have to say about
the Americans' accusations...

819
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:31,000
...that Europe's incapacity to do anything
is due to UNPROFOR's internal problems?

820
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:34,400
I've heard no such accusations.
You must judge for yourself.

821
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:38,200
The UNPROFOR is perfectly fulfilling
its mission. Thank you very much.

822
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,800
What are the relationships between
the British and the French?

823
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:45,100
I think we'll have to deal with that later.
It's far too complicated.

824
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:49,500
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

825
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,800
-How's it going?
-We have a problem, sir.

826
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,000
-What problem?
-One of the soldiers is on a mine.

827
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,200
It's impossible to defuse it.

828
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,100
What?

829
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,400
The mine disposal expert says
it is impossible to defuse it.

830
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:06,300
This whole fucking business stinks
to high heaven, as I said from the start.

831
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,700
If the journalists get one whiff of this,
they'll crucify us.

832
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,000
Shit.

833
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:16,200
What did you decide?
What are we going to do?

834
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,900
Get back into the trench.
Pretend to be busy.

835
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:22,000
-We've got to buy ourselves some time.
-Excuse me to repeat--

836
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,500
Get back into the trench!

837
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,200
That's an order.

838
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,900
Captain, what's happening?

839
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:54,100
The mine disposal expert
has begun his job.

840
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,300
You will be informed
as soon as he will be finished.

841
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:01,700
-I think it's going to take a little while.
-Can we approach?

842
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:05,500
Unfortunately, for security reasons,
I cannot allow that.

843
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,900
You wanted to kill me with my own knife?

844
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,200
Oh, shit.

845
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,900
Quick! Tom!

846
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,200
Is that how you thank me?

847
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,600
Don't come any closer!

848
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,900
You're all the same!

849
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,100
And you vultures film it?

850
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,600
You get good money?
Does our misery pay well?

851
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:25,700
No!

852
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,200
-Did you get it?
-Yes.

853
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:56,800
Captain? Over here, please.

854
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,200
What do you think--

855
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,800
Take it easy.

856
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,900
Listen....

857
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,300
There was no other solution.

858
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:24,200
Marchand! Put the bodies in the car.
We're going.

859
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,600
-What's happening?
-The mine expert's defused it.

860
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:29,600
-He has?
-Yes.

861
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,500
Colonel, sir,
can we just have a few questions?

862
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:11,000
Ladies and gentleman, what can I say?
You see the conditions we work under.

863
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:13,500
Our focus now must be
on the remaining soldier.

864
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,700
We hope to be able to save
at least one life.

865
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,400
-Can we come closer? Can we film it?
-Eventually.

866
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:21,900
He's in critical condition and has to be
taken to a hospital immediately.

867
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,200
When he's in a fit state to answer
your questions, you'll be informed.

868
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:31,200
The press conference tonight
at 22:00 at the Holiday lnn...

869
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,700
...at which time I shall be happy to answer
any of your questions.

870
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:38,200
For the time being, I must ask you please
to prepare to leave the field...

871
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:42,000
...since I can no longer guarantee
your safety. Night is beginning to fall.

872
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:44,700
Please, ladies and gentlemen,
prepare to go.

873
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,800
Thank you.

874
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:22,400
-What's going on?
-We took out the mine expert's gear.

875
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,900
-What about him?
-lf you have an idea, let me know.

876
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,100
-We can't leave him there!
-You have a solution?

877
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:32,700
You heard the mine expert.

878
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,500
I hope you understand now.

879
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:40,700
It's not our business, so we stay out of it.

880
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,700
Everything all right, Captain?
Good work, gentlemen.

881
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,200
I'm very pleased.

882
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:51,100
I have no doubt that in the fullness of time
you'll be duly compensated.

883
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,900
You've got the contact numbers
from Dubois?

884
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,300
Call them, will you,
and notify them that they're dead.

885
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Then I'd like you to notify each side...

886
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,700
...that we have information
that the other side...

887
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:16,700
...is planning to commandeer
the central trench this evening.

888
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,200
Could you call me the liaison
of the Bosnians, please? Thank you.

889
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,800
-Well, see you round.
-See you.

890
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,600
I wanted to thank you.

891
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:39,200
-You got your report.
-Yes.

892
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,000
Are you okay?

893
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,100
-Ready to go?
-Sorry?

894
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,000
-Are you ready to go?
-Yes.

895
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:51,500
Let's not hang around, let's go.

896
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,800
-I hope we meet again.
-I hope so.

897
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,200
Remember the press conference tonight,
22:00, all right?

898
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:00,200
Yes.

899
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,900
I know what you're thinking, Sergeant.

900
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:11,400
It wouldn't make any difference, you know.
It wouldn't change anything.

901
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,400
Off you go.

902
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,700
Are you sure you don't want me
to film the trench?

903
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:28,100
No. A trench is a trench.
They're all the same.
