1
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:03,968
<i>Okay.</i>

2
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,267
<i>911 emergency.</i>

3
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:15,609
I need an ambulance.

4
00:01:15,815 --> 00:01:20,507
<i>I have you at 9212 West Third</i>
<i>Street in Los Angeles.</i>

5
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:26,116
Yes, room number 2.

6
00:01:26,325 --> 00:01:28,555
<i>What's the emergency?</i>

7
00:01:30,896 --> 00:01:33,057
There's been a suicide.

8
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:35,166
<i>Who's the victim?</i>

9
00:01:37,136 --> 00:01:38,763
I am.

10
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:50,309
<i>In seven days,</i>
<i>God created the world.</i>

11
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:55,813
<i>And in seven seconds...</i>

12
00:01:59,425 --> 00:02:02,019
<i>... I shattered mine.</i>

13
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:59,607
- <i>I can have four new fillets overnight.</i>
- Oh, no. No, thank you.

14
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,946
What is your name again? Ezra?
Is that right?

15
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:04,884
Yes, sir. I'll just need
your first and last name...

16
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:07,355
...so I can call up your account.
- <i>You know what?</i>

17
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,462
Here's what I'm thinking, Ezra. I think
I'm gonna mail you the meat back...

18
00:03:11,664 --> 00:03:14,997
...so you can see firsthand the type
of dog food that you're peddling.

19
00:03:15,201 --> 00:03:18,693
That won't be necessary, sir.

20
00:03:18,904 --> 00:03:21,668
So how about we just start
with your last name?

21
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:23,068
Thomas.

22
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:25,140
And don't even get me started
on the pork.

23
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:27,505
- Have you tried the pork?
- <i>Well, no, sir.</i>

24
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:31,205
I'm not much of a meat eater myself,
but I hear really great things...

25
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:32,577
...about the pork.

26
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:36,016
- Oh, so you don't eat pork at all?
- No, sir.

27
00:03:36,222 --> 00:03:40,022
Are you Jewish?
Is that why you don't eat pork, Ezra?

28
00:03:42,194 --> 00:03:46,688
Well, can we...?
What's your first name, Mr. Thomas?

29
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:49,734
Ben.

30
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:56,038
Hold on, what was that voice?

31
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:59,575
I don't... I don't have an order
for a Ben Thomas.

32
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:02,179
Ezra, what was that voice?

33
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:04,872
- What voice?
- Are you blind?

34
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:07,609
- Excuse me?
- <i>You're kidding me.</i>

35
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:13,019
A blind beef salesman
who doesn't eat meat.

36
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:17,858
<i>Now, that... That is rich.</i>
<i>That is rich.</i>

37
00:04:18,063 --> 00:04:19,860
Have you ever had sex, Ezra?

38
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,535
Did Lawrence in Accounting
put you up to this?

39
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:28,002
Because somehow I can't imagine
the blind, vegan...

40
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:30,437
<i>... beef salesman having sex.</i>

41
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:33,908
- Listen, I'm trying to help you, sir.
- <i>You're trying to help me?</i>

42
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:36,946
The blind beef salesman
is trying to help me?

43
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:40,141
I'm actually starting to feel
pretty bad for you, Ezra.

44
00:04:40,352 --> 00:04:44,482
Because I look at my life, and it is
surrounded by so much beauty...

45
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,853
<i>... and you can't see shit.</i>

46
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,755
Is that fair?

47
00:04:49,962 --> 00:04:51,589
Does that seem fair to you, Ezra?

48
00:04:51,797 --> 00:04:54,061
Do you even know
what color the ocean is?

49
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:56,494
<i>Do you?</i>

50
00:04:57,002 --> 00:04:59,436
- It's blue, sir.
- <i>"It's blue, sir."</i>

51
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:00,900
Say what you wanna say.

52
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:03,074
<i>React.</i>
<i>Say what you wanna say to me.</i>

53
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:05,004
Thank you for calling
Cheyenne Meats.

54
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:09,011
That's not what you wanna say,
you coward. You coward.

55
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:13,242
You blind, vegan, beef-salesman,
virgin coward!

56
00:05:13,452 --> 00:05:16,580
- Goodbye, Mr. Thomas.
- <i>Say what you wanna say.</i>

57
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:42,839
Ken Anderson. Nicole Anderson.
Allie Anderson. Ed Rice.

58
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:47,485
Steven Phillips. Monica Freeman.
Sarah Jensen.

59
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:57,259
Ken Anderson! Nicole Anderson!
Allie Anderson! Ed Rice!

60
00:05:57,463 --> 00:06:02,127
Steven Phillips! Monica Freeman!
And Sarah Jensen!

61
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:47,295
Hi, can I help you?

62
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:51,966
Yes. Hello, I'm looking for Emily.

63
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:53,872
- You're a friend of hers?
- Yes, ma'am.

64
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,444
- She's not home.
- Oh, goodness.

65
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:58,708
No, she left this morning.
She had to do some more tests.

66
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:02,213
She asked me to watch Duke
until she got back.

67
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:04,383
Okay.

68
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:08,025
You ever try mixing banana peel
into the soil?

69
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:11,128
- Really?
- It works, I swear.

70
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,596
Oh, would you by chance
know where I could find her?

71
00:08:23,676 --> 00:08:28,511
<i>Supervisor to 104.</i>
<i>Supervisor to 104.</i>

72
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:31,338
Cardiac wing?

73
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,916
Take the elevator to the fifth floor
then turn left.

74
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,882
Thank you.

75
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:42,193
Well, that's what I was just saying.
It's absolutely impossible.

76
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:47,529
Hold the elevator.

77
00:08:49,368 --> 00:08:51,199
Thank you.

78
00:09:45,924 --> 00:09:47,915
Can I help you?

79
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:51,352
Yes. Good evening.

80
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:54,729
I'm here to see Emily Posa.

81
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:58,960
I'm sorry, visiting hours
are from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.

82
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:03,231
You know, it is really important
I speak to her for just a moment.

83
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:07,071
You'll just have to come back
during visiting hours.

84
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:10,706
Thank you very much.

85
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:08,232
So if there is one thing
that I have learned...

86
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,238
...and you all should remember
about winning these contracts:

87
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:15,140
Three steps. First, tell them
what you're gonna tell them.

88
00:11:15,347 --> 00:11:17,315
Step two, you tell them.

89
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:20,917
Step three,
tell them what you told them.

90
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,449
We are gonna close
by reminding them...

91
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:27,147
...that old girl has a 3-percent better
impulse from sea level to vacuum...

92
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,318
...and if they pass on that, quite
frankly, they deserve another Sputnik.

93
00:11:37,002 --> 00:11:38,560
Now, if you will excuse me...

94
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,331
...I have a very lovely, very hungry
woman at home waiting for me.

95
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:46,606
<i>Sarah.</i>

96
00:11:49,781 --> 00:11:51,271
Honey.

97
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,150
Everyone at work kept saying
it was daylight-savings time.

98
00:11:57,356 --> 00:11:59,187
You were supposed
to be here a while ago.

99
00:11:59,391 --> 00:12:02,554
- I kept saying it wasn't.
- This happens all the time. It's work.

100
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:04,991
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, I'm angry with you.

101
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:06,755
I'm gonna be angry all night long.

102
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:08,990
- I'm angry with you.
- What are you doing?

103
00:12:09,201 --> 00:12:12,034
How about that?
How about I'm angry with you?

104
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:27,274
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me. It's your brother.

105
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:30,148
<i>Where are you?</i>

106
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:33,123
I'm at the beach house.

107
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:35,793
<i>Are you okay?</i>

108
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:38,696
Of course.

109
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:42,996
<i>Listen, why'd you disconnect</i>
<i>the landline?</i>

110
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:47,003
The phone broke.

111
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:49,469
<i>I don't need it anymore.</i>

112
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:53,342
Did I? Did I do something?

113
00:12:54,613 --> 00:12:56,240
No.

114
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:58,883
Not unless you're smoking again.

115
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:04,078
No, I've put on 20 pounds.
I'm in the best shape of my life.

116
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:07,324
<i>Are you eating?</i>
<i>Are you taking care of yourself?</i>

117
00:13:07,526 --> 00:13:11,462
- <i>You sound terrible again and...</i>
- Yeah, I'm fine. Look, I gotta go.

118
00:13:11,663 --> 00:13:14,530
Give Melanie and the kids
a hug and a kiss.

119
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:17,634
I'll talk to you later.
You take care of yourself.

120
00:13:17,836 --> 00:13:21,932
Hold on. I know it's been a while,
but when you were staying here...

121
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,008
...you didn't take something of mine
by mistake, did you?

122
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:29,446
I remember giving you something.

123
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:35,409
You remember that?
Because I remember that very clearly.

124
00:13:36,388 --> 00:13:39,050
Yeah. Yeah.

125
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:43,021
Just remember I love you.

126
00:14:19,998 --> 00:14:23,161
Hi, my name is Ben Thomas.
I'm here to see Stewart Goodman.

127
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:26,667
Inez, look at me, please.

128
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:30,367
Inez. I'm speaking to you.

129
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:35,772
I understand you refused to take
your meds again. Is that true?

130
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:37,676
No, no, no.

131
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:43,645
Let's try using your words
this time, okay, Inez?

132
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:46,517
I mean, this silent treatment
isn't doing anybody any good.

133
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:49,023
Inez, how can we help you if...?

134
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:51,625
Okay, how about I come back
tomorrow...

135
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,732
...and see if you've changed
your mind, okay?

136
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:57,731
Thattagirl.

137
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:03,339
I thought I was coming
to your office today.

138
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,943
I was in the neighborhood. I thought
I'd stop by, save you the drive.

139
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:10,581
Terrific. Well, look, let's go talk
in my office, yeah? Come on.

140
00:15:10,782 --> 00:15:12,147
<i>I take a no-nonsense approach.</i>

141
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,580
I mean, I cut the operating costs
of this place...

142
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:17,380
...over 17 percent last year alone.

143
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,958
- I'm sure that made them happy.
- Oh, hell, yeah.

144
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,185
Now, if I could only get
my own finances...

145
00:15:24,396 --> 00:15:27,126
...in that kind of shape,
I wouldn't have you sitting here.

146
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:28,560
No offense.

147
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,860
That your new Beemer out front?

148
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:38,733
Ben, I mean, when I found out...

149
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:41,538
...that my bone-marrow transplant
wasn't successful...

150
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:45,307
I'm well aware of your
ongoing medical condition.

151
00:15:45,984 --> 00:15:48,145
Things aren't looking
very promising for me.

152
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,581
Look...

153
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:55,885
...I have a bonus coming in January.

154
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:59,359
I just really need
this six-month extension.

155
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:04,095
Really, I mean, I am doing the very
best I can here, I promise you.

156
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,212
I'm gonna show myself out.

157
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:18,872
I'll be in touch.

158
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:21,018
Well, thank you. I appreciate it.

159
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:23,687
I mean, this way
everybody wins, right?

160
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:37,294
Hello.

161
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:46,873
My name is Ben.

162
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,748
I totally understand
if you don't wanna speak to me either.

163
00:16:52,951 --> 00:16:57,081
But I would really like
to just have a moment of your time.

164
00:17:16,341 --> 00:17:21,335
I'm trying to figure out
what kind of man Stewart Goodman is.

165
00:17:24,182 --> 00:17:30,143
It is within my power to drastically
change his circumstances.

166
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:36,018
But I don't wanna give that man
a gift that he doesn't deserve.

167
00:17:38,997 --> 00:17:43,366
I need you to tell me
whether or not he is a good person.

168
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:13,692
"The drug he gives me...

169
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:17,827
...makes me dizzy.

170
00:18:21,206 --> 00:18:23,367
I want a new one."

171
00:18:23,575 --> 00:18:26,772
Well, that sounds
very reasonable, Inez.

172
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:29,240
What else?

173
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,383
You can trust me.

174
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:38,847
What else, Inez?

175
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,203
He's punishing you?

176
00:18:58,043 --> 00:19:00,238
How is he punishing you?

177
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:07,283
How is he punishing you, Inez?

178
00:19:30,975 --> 00:19:32,533
Ben?

179
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:35,775
- Hey, Ben, where you going?
- Where's the washroom?

180
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,141
To the right. Is there a problem?

181
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,148
- Give her a bath, right now.
- Absolutely.

182
00:19:41,353 --> 00:19:44,516
Thank you. Thank you.

183
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:48,150
You have the wrong
impression here.

184
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,089
I'm gonna stop by
from time to time...

185
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:52,593
...make sure you're showing
these people some respect.

186
00:19:52,797 --> 00:19:54,992
Look, this is
a misunderstanding, okay?

187
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,293
You don't treat people like that.

188
00:19:57,502 --> 00:19:59,094
Let me explain, okay, Ben?

189
00:19:59,304 --> 00:20:01,238
- And I'm not giving you an extension.
- Ben!

190
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:03,532
I'm not giving you anything.

191
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:06,776
I almost believed you,
you son of a bitch.

192
00:20:06,978 --> 00:20:09,310
I almost believed.

193
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:20,590
Okay. Grip and rip.

194
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:24,922
This time it's gonna be
a lot different.

195
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:28,296
Hey.

196
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:31,929
- Hey, Michelle.
- Hey.

197
00:20:32,504 --> 00:20:36,133
- Good to see you.
- You too.

198
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:37,433
- How are you?
- I'm good.

199
00:20:37,642 --> 00:20:39,769
- Hey, man.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

200
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:43,880
Just coming to make sure that she
is still kicking your ass at everything.

201
00:20:44,082 --> 00:20:45,982
And I am.

202
00:20:46,718 --> 00:20:48,845
- Can we have a sec, hon?
- Yeah.

203
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:50,987
All right.

204
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:52,549
You okay?

205
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:57,285
Yeah, I'm good. You said you were
gonna call me on the 15th.

206
00:20:57,495 --> 00:20:58,894
- Today is the 19th.
- I know.

207
00:20:59,097 --> 00:21:02,430
Doctor didn't have the results,
so I had no information to give you.

208
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:04,499
Still, you should call me.

209
00:21:04,702 --> 00:21:07,296
- Yeah, I know. Yes, I know.
- We're still friends. Right?

210
00:21:07,505 --> 00:21:10,372
Yeah. I'm just...

211
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:13,033
I'm doing some soul-searching,
you know?

212
00:21:16,381 --> 00:21:17,370
Don't do that.

213
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:19,141
- We have a plan.
- I know.

214
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,648
- Do what you promised me.
- I will.

215
00:21:21,853 --> 00:21:23,980
You know, they rent clubs
up at the clubhouse.

216
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:25,918
I'm well aware of that.

217
00:21:26,124 --> 00:21:29,355
I think I'm gonna keep my ass
unkicked today.

218
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:50,372
Were you looking at him,
or were you looking at me?

219
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,408
Actually, I was just sitting here.

220
00:22:54,612 --> 00:22:56,807
Am I doing it wrong?

221
00:22:57,448 --> 00:23:00,315
I think I saw you
in the elevator the other day.

222
00:23:00,518 --> 00:23:02,452
Oh, yes.

223
00:23:04,689 --> 00:23:07,658
Actually, you are being audited.

224
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,859
My name is Ben Thomas.

225
00:23:11,062 --> 00:23:15,158
I'm with the IRS,
and you owe the government...

226
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:18,824
...$56, 240.19.

227
00:23:19,037 --> 00:23:20,766
I know.

228
00:23:20,972 --> 00:23:23,372
And now you get me.

229
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:26,442
Would you have a seat, please,
Miss Posa?

230
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,879
So I've been looking over
the income statements...

231
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:35,541
...from the last three years.

232
00:23:35,753 --> 00:23:37,220
- 2005...
- Were...?

233
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,318
Were you in my room
the other night?

234
00:23:42,894 --> 00:23:47,456
No, ma'am, I was not
in your room the other night.

235
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:52,429
That's not exactly IRS protocol.

236
00:23:52,637 --> 00:23:54,969
So I've been looking over
'05, '06 and '07.

237
00:23:55,173 --> 00:23:59,166
There seems to be quite a disparity
between what you claimed and...

238
00:23:59,377 --> 00:24:00,639
Mr. Thomas?

239
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,649
I just got discharged.

240
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,148
So, you know,
unless you're gonna, like...

241
00:24:08,353 --> 00:24:10,446
...haul me off
to some IRS jail or something...

242
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:13,988
...I'd really like to get home now.

243
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:18,151
- Oh, sure. No problem.
- Okay.

244
00:24:19,097 --> 00:24:20,792
I'll be in touch.

245
00:25:01,272 --> 00:25:04,605
Welcome to the Travel Inn.
Can I help you?

246
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:06,140
I need a room.

247
00:25:06,344 --> 00:25:07,777
How many hours?

248
00:25:10,181 --> 00:25:12,115
About two weeks.

249
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:46,175
Clear it! That's it, that's it!

250
00:25:46,751 --> 00:25:49,242
All right, come on! <i>Vamos,</i> Manny!

251
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:52,821
All right, all right. That's it, that's it.

252
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:55,516
Hey!

253
00:25:57,328 --> 00:25:58,659
- What you want?
- Break it up!

254
00:25:58,863 --> 00:26:01,195
- You want some of this?
- Get off! Get off!

255
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:03,697
Hey, Rico, knock it off!

256
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:06,165
Somebody wanna remind Rico
where we are?

257
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,201
The sanctuary, coach!

258
00:26:08,406 --> 00:26:11,239
- I can't hear you.
- The sanctuary, coach!

259
00:26:11,442 --> 00:26:14,138
That's right, Rico, in the sanctuary.

260
00:26:14,345 --> 00:26:16,939
Now give me 20 starts and stops.

261
00:26:17,548 --> 00:26:18,947
<i>Hello, this is Emily Posa.</i>

262
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,244
<i>I'm not home right now,</i>
<i>but please leave a message...</i>

263
00:26:22,453 --> 00:26:26,150
<i>... and I'll call you back</i>
<i>as soon as possible. Thank you.</i>

264
00:26:26,357 --> 00:26:29,019
<i>Hi, my name is Susan Nall.</i>
<i>I'm calling because a friend...</i>

265
00:26:29,227 --> 00:26:32,663
<i>... told me you do letterpress</i>
<i>invitations, and I was wondering...</i>

266
00:26:32,864 --> 00:26:35,458
Hello? Hi, this is Emily.

267
00:26:38,469 --> 00:26:41,632
Yep, I do wedding invitations.

268
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,239
I'm not able to take any requests,
though, right now.

269
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:47,607
I know someone nearby who does it.

270
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:51,748
She's not as good as I am,
but her prices are very...

271
00:26:53,718 --> 00:26:55,185
Hello?

272
00:27:02,226 --> 00:27:03,750
Duke?

273
00:27:07,899 --> 00:27:09,389
Duke.

274
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,329
We're out here.

275
00:27:18,176 --> 00:27:20,041
Hello, Miss Posa.

276
00:27:20,878 --> 00:27:22,402
What are you doing here?

277
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:24,103
Oh, I came to see you.

278
00:27:24,315 --> 00:27:26,647
Don't you people ever call ahead?

279
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:29,720
You people tend to try
to hide things.

280
00:27:29,921 --> 00:27:31,388
Is that meat?

281
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:33,853
No! No, no.

282
00:27:34,058 --> 00:27:36,390
No. No meat. No.

283
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:40,928
- Well, he was really enjoying it.
- He eats steamed broccoli and tofu.

284
00:27:41,132 --> 00:27:43,623
- Why?
- He's a vegetarian.

285
00:27:44,368 --> 00:27:47,098
- He is a vegetarian?
- Yes.

286
00:27:47,305 --> 00:27:49,466
Well, that sucks.

287
00:27:49,674 --> 00:27:53,201
Hey, can we talk?
Do you have a moment?

288
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:55,177
No.

289
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:57,847
Actually, I have to take Duke
for a walk.

290
00:27:58,482 --> 00:28:02,919
No problem. I'll go with you,
if you don't mind.

291
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:06,285
- So...
- Hey, hey.

292
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,980
Hey.

293
00:28:08,192 --> 00:28:14,028
So I've been looking over
2005, 2006 and 2007.

294
00:28:14,232 --> 00:28:15,893
Now...

295
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,567
I'm listening.

296
00:28:17,768 --> 00:28:21,670
- Can I get him for you?
- Nope. I got him.

297
00:28:22,373 --> 00:28:24,807
Let me get him. Let me get him.
Let me get him.

298
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:26,806
- You all right?
- Yes.

299
00:28:27,979 --> 00:28:29,844
Whoa, sorry. Whoa, not these.

300
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:34,381
- That's okay. Watch...
- No, no. Heel, heel, heel.

301
00:28:35,052 --> 00:28:38,044
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't
feed him meat.

302
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:40,247
So I've been looking over...

303
00:28:42,426 --> 00:28:45,190
- Yeah, maybe we can do this later.
- Yeah.

304
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:52,000
So you cook it all
ahead of time, I see.

305
00:28:52,203 --> 00:28:55,366
No, actually. I can't remember
the last time I cooked.

306
00:28:55,573 --> 00:29:00,670
This is my sister's way
of looking out for me from afar.

307
00:29:00,878 --> 00:29:02,402
Do you have any siblings?

308
00:29:02,613 --> 00:29:05,480
Yes, one brother.

309
00:29:05,683 --> 00:29:07,776
He's a... He's a good egg.

310
00:29:07,985 --> 00:29:10,783
Yeah, I just have the one sister too.

311
00:29:11,956 --> 00:29:14,652
Are you receiving income
from any source...

312
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:17,123
...that the government
is currently unaware of?

313
00:29:17,328 --> 00:29:21,492
Well, lately I've been taking
to diving in local wishing wells, so...

314
00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:24,930
I mean, but it's just occasional dimes
here and there...

315
00:29:25,136 --> 00:29:26,865
...or, once in a while, a quarter.

316
00:29:28,172 --> 00:29:30,333
No, actually...

317
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:34,068
...I had to refinance this place
to pay my past-due medical bills.

318
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:40,178
I've been informed that you suffer
from congenital heart failure.

319
00:29:40,384 --> 00:29:44,878
Yes. Did you gather that
while stalking me at the hospital?

320
00:29:45,356 --> 00:29:47,324
No, I...

321
00:29:48,492 --> 00:29:52,258
You're currently Status 2,
which means you're sick enough...

322
00:29:52,463 --> 00:29:54,761
...to be on the national UNOS
waiting list...

323
00:29:54,966 --> 00:29:57,901
...but not sick enough to be admitted
into the hospital...

324
00:29:58,102 --> 00:30:00,297
...and placed on Status 1.

325
00:30:00,504 --> 00:30:04,702
So basically, if your heart starts to fail
quickly and no donor can be located...

326
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,110
...you're screwed.

327
00:30:10,047 --> 00:30:13,483
Is it true that you said...

328
00:30:13,684 --> 00:30:16,619
...that you do not believe
that you even deserve a heart...

329
00:30:16,821 --> 00:30:21,986
...because your life is unremarkable
in every way?

330
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,758
I'm sorry.

331
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:39,275
I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry.

332
00:30:39,477 --> 00:30:42,640
Do you have to take any type
of sensitivity training...

333
00:30:42,847 --> 00:30:44,280
...to join the IRS, Mr. Thomas?

334
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:47,815
- No, not really.
- Yeah.

335
00:30:49,854 --> 00:30:52,721
So you don't consider yourself
a good person?

336
00:30:53,691 --> 00:30:57,218
How would you answer that question
if I asked you the same?

337
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:06,962
"Unremarkable" would be
an upgrade for me...

338
00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:09,002
...I assure you.

339
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:18,007
I'm gonna freeze your accounts
as uncollectible until further notice.

340
00:31:18,616 --> 00:31:22,143
I'm sure that'll buy you
five or six months, penalty-free.

341
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:29,654
Here's my card.

342
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,296
If anyone from the IRS
tries to contact you...

343
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:35,624
...you call me immediately.

344
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,323
Okay.

345
00:31:38,402 --> 00:31:40,063
Thank you.

346
00:31:40,671 --> 00:31:42,536
Thank you.

347
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,502
Okay.

348
00:31:50,314 --> 00:31:52,839
- Mr. Thomas?
- Yes.

349
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:08,728
Why do I get the feeling you're
doing me a really big favor right now?

350
00:32:11,735 --> 00:32:15,967
Because I get the feeling
that you really deserve it.

351
00:32:19,276 --> 00:32:20,834
All right?

352
00:32:26,884 --> 00:32:28,715
You off to?

353
00:32:29,987 --> 00:32:32,683
You off to pollute
someone else's dog now?

354
00:32:34,825 --> 00:32:36,452
No.

355
00:32:38,662 --> 00:32:40,254
Just going home.

356
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:42,992
Where's that?

357
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,410
Take care, Emily.

358
00:32:55,746 --> 00:32:57,304
You too.

359
00:34:31,442 --> 00:34:34,969
- What is this thing for?
- I told you already.

360
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,579
And why are you bringing a fish
into your room?

361
00:34:37,781 --> 00:34:39,840
Because it's my room.

362
00:34:40,584 --> 00:34:43,485
And I don't want anyone going
into my room, understood?

363
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:46,087
Well, I don't think you can
keep a fish in your room.

364
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,349
I think I can.

365
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:51,995
Well, I've never had anybody
who kept a fish in their room.

366
00:34:52,196 --> 00:34:53,686
Now you do.

367
00:34:53,897 --> 00:34:55,330
Who?

368
00:34:55,532 --> 00:34:57,056
Good night.

369
00:35:13,617 --> 00:35:17,075
<i>The first time I ever saw</i>
<i>a box jellyfish...</i>

370
00:35:19,156 --> 00:35:20,953
<i>... I was 12.</i>

371
00:35:26,397 --> 00:35:31,130
<i>Our father took us</i>
<i>to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.</i>

372
00:35:34,038 --> 00:35:36,563
<i>I never forgot when he said...</i>

373
00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:41,677
<i>... that it was the most</i>
<i>deadly creature on earth.</i>

374
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:47,407
<i>To me it was just...</i>

375
00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:51,345
<i>... the most beautiful thing</i>
<i>I'd ever seen.</i>

376
00:35:59,897 --> 00:36:01,159
I spoke to the doctor again.

377
00:36:01,365 --> 00:36:04,596
He's gonna send over your files
in the morning.

378
00:36:06,403 --> 00:36:09,702
- Is this everything?
- Yeah.

379
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:13,308
- Any questions?
- Same one.

380
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,943
Well, same answer, then.

381
00:36:15,746 --> 00:36:18,476
You know, I was thinking last night
about when we were 14...

382
00:36:18,682 --> 00:36:21,742
...and we made our big pact.

383
00:36:21,952 --> 00:36:25,115
You remember on the beach
in front of your grandparents' house...

384
00:36:25,322 --> 00:36:30,919
...we agreed that we would never,
never date each other's girls?

385
00:36:32,196 --> 00:36:36,292
I remembered that that night you told
me how much you liked Stacy Miller...

386
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,298
...and that you were gonna
ask her out. And I said:

387
00:36:39,503 --> 00:36:44,167
"Hey, man. You can't.
Her and I already did it."

388
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:45,967
Which we didn't, but I wanted to...

389
00:36:46,176 --> 00:36:51,045
...but she liked you way more
than she liked me, and...

390
00:36:51,248 --> 00:36:53,273
So I lied to you
because I was so jealous.

391
00:36:53,984 --> 00:36:58,011
And I realized that I've been
carrying around this lie...

392
00:36:58,222 --> 00:37:00,452
...in my heart for the last 25...

393
00:37:00,657 --> 00:37:01,988
Stop it!

394
00:37:03,794 --> 00:37:05,455
Stop it.

395
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:08,656
Stay focused.

396
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,494
Do what you promised me.

397
00:37:12,202 --> 00:37:15,899
- What, you think I'm...?
- Do what you promised me.

398
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:21,674
You think I'm gonna
let you down now, don't you?

399
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:24,905
I've known you my whole damn life!

400
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:26,207
Okay?

401
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:29,818
This? This? This is not something
you do every day.

402
00:37:30,921 --> 00:37:34,357
Okay? This is...
This is not easy for me.

403
00:37:35,726 --> 00:37:38,559
I'll make sure everything goes
as planned.

404
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:46,361
Don't worry.

405
00:37:50,073 --> 00:37:51,665
Thank you.

406
00:38:17,935 --> 00:38:20,927
Oh, my God.

407
00:38:21,138 --> 00:38:22,696
Hello, Holly.

408
00:38:23,307 --> 00:38:24,831
Look at you.

409
00:38:28,779 --> 00:38:31,873
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.

410
00:38:32,082 --> 00:38:34,209
- Really?
- You have a minute?

411
00:38:34,418 --> 00:38:36,818
Sure. Come on in.

412
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,955
Here's my desk. Have a seat.

413
00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:52,958
You look great.

414
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,899
- I do?
- Yes.

415
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:57,096
I feel great.

416
00:38:57,307 --> 00:39:00,765
- How are you?
- I'm really good.

417
00:39:01,678 --> 00:39:03,111
I need a favor.

418
00:39:03,313 --> 00:39:07,113
Whatever you need, just ask me.

419
00:39:07,918 --> 00:39:10,648
I need a name.
Someone in the system.

420
00:39:10,854 --> 00:39:13,880
Someone having
a really hard time...

421
00:39:14,091 --> 00:39:17,720
...that needs help, but may be
too proud to ask for a handout.

422
00:39:21,532 --> 00:39:23,500
What are you doing?

423
00:39:25,402 --> 00:39:27,336
I'm helping.

424
00:39:31,074 --> 00:39:32,905
I need a name.

425
00:39:36,013 --> 00:39:38,140
Okay.

426
00:39:39,716 --> 00:39:41,980
<i>Connie Tepos.</i>

427
00:39:42,185 --> 00:39:46,554
<i>Her boyfriend almost killed her</i>
<i>last year when she tried to leave.</i>

428
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:50,918
<i>He broke three of her ribs</i>
<i>last month.</i>

429
00:39:51,628 --> 00:39:53,994
<i>She's scared to death</i>
<i>to press charges...</i>

430
00:39:54,197 --> 00:39:56,256
<i>... and we can't do anything.</i>

431
00:40:08,145 --> 00:40:09,874
- Hello.
- Hi.

432
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,310
- Connie Tepos?
- Yes?

433
00:40:12,516 --> 00:40:15,644
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS.

434
00:40:15,852 --> 00:40:18,013
IRS? But I always pay my taxes.

435
00:40:18,221 --> 00:40:21,884
Yes, this is more of
a general inquiry.

436
00:40:22,092 --> 00:40:24,458
I don't understand. What...?

437
00:40:25,796 --> 00:40:26,956
May I come in?

438
00:40:27,164 --> 00:40:30,133
Not now. My boyfriend is not here.

439
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:33,360
It's very important for your family.

440
00:40:34,171 --> 00:40:35,798
For my family?

441
00:40:47,851 --> 00:40:49,580
Beautiful.

442
00:40:50,854 --> 00:40:54,085
Please, have a seat.

443
00:40:57,027 --> 00:40:58,392
What's this all about?

444
00:41:00,163 --> 00:41:02,597
Your case has come to my attention.

445
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,732
And I wanted to get to know you.

446
00:41:06,403 --> 00:41:08,871
You wanted to get to know me?
Why?

447
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,405
Because I'd like to help you.

448
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,402
I don't understand.

449
00:41:19,016 --> 00:41:21,610
I'm aware of your case.

450
00:41:22,285 --> 00:41:23,650
And your boyfriend.

451
00:41:23,854 --> 00:41:25,788
What are you talking about?

452
00:41:28,492 --> 00:41:30,960
You know what I'm talking about.

453
00:41:31,161 --> 00:41:33,789
No, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

454
00:41:35,932 --> 00:41:38,594
Kids, go to your room.

455
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:40,836
He's coming back?

456
00:41:41,038 --> 00:41:43,836
He's not coming back.

457
00:41:55,085 --> 00:41:57,576
You said you were from the IRS,
but you're lying to me.

458
00:41:57,788 --> 00:41:59,483
- No.
- You're not telling me the truth.

459
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,918
Who sent you here?

460
00:42:01,124 --> 00:42:02,751
Please sit down.

461
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:04,426
I'm not going to sit down.

462
00:42:04,628 --> 00:42:07,392
- Please, calm down.
- I'm not going to calm down.

463
00:42:07,597 --> 00:42:08,825
You come into my house.

464
00:42:09,032 --> 00:42:11,830
You talking to me
about <i>mi caso y mi</i> boyfriend?

465
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:15,095
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.

466
00:42:16,073 --> 00:42:18,007
Nobody?
Get out of my house immediately.

467
00:42:20,077 --> 00:42:21,203
You can trust me.

468
00:42:21,411 --> 00:42:23,606
I trust no one, Mr. Thomas.

469
00:42:23,814 --> 00:42:25,179
I talked to Holly.

470
00:42:26,616 --> 00:42:28,982
I can get you out of here.

471
00:42:29,186 --> 00:42:34,089
To a safe place. A beautiful place.

472
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:36,816
Why did you talk to Holly?

473
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:38,517
Your children are in danger here.

474
00:42:38,729 --> 00:42:40,526
Don't talk about my kids,
Mr. Thomas.

475
00:42:40,731 --> 00:42:43,700
- You don't know.
- You don't have to live like this.

476
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,494
Get out of my house now
or I'm gonna call the police.

477
00:42:46,703 --> 00:42:48,330
- Okay, okay.
- Who are you?

478
00:42:48,538 --> 00:42:50,836
- I want you to take my card.
- I don't need help.

479
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:52,872
I want you to take my card,
and call me...

480
00:42:53,076 --> 00:42:54,771
- I don't need it.
- I'm gonna leave it.

481
00:42:54,978 --> 00:42:56,741
Okay. Thank you. Get out right now.

482
00:42:56,947 --> 00:43:00,144
- You're not helpless.
- Can you leave? This is my house.

483
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,215
Please, just think about it.

484
00:43:04,421 --> 00:43:06,389
I don't need you.

485
00:43:24,841 --> 00:43:27,366
- I can't talk right now.
- <i>I need to talk immediately.</i>

486
00:43:27,577 --> 00:43:28,908
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- I'm nowhere.

487
00:43:29,112 --> 00:43:30,739
I'm gonna meet you at the house.

488
00:43:30,947 --> 00:43:35,008
Look, no. I'm not at the house.
I'm traveling. I'll talk to you next week.

489
00:43:35,218 --> 00:43:38,244
No, no, no. We need to
discuss this right now.

490
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,307
Wouldn't wanna get
on her bad side.

491
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,001
- I'll sign to that.
- Yeah.

492
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,313
How you doing, you two?

493
00:44:38,515 --> 00:44:40,142
I'm good.

494
00:44:41,051 --> 00:44:42,313
Got a big day.

495
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:45,386
Yep. No more dialysis, George.
See you in the O.R.

496
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:47,147
Yep.

497
00:44:47,991 --> 00:44:49,720
- I'll see you there as well.
- Yes, sir.

498
00:44:49,926 --> 00:44:51,416
Thank you.

499
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,959
So I heard you raised
enough money...

500
00:44:55,165 --> 00:44:58,157
...to give a couple of the kids
partial scholarships to college.

501
00:44:58,368 --> 00:45:00,302
It's no big deal.

502
00:45:00,503 --> 00:45:02,630
I just convinced a couple
of bigwig donors...

503
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:06,570
...that what the world really needs
to see is more Latinos on ice.

504
00:45:10,747 --> 00:45:14,114
You know, Ben,
I keep asking you this...

505
00:45:14,317 --> 00:45:17,411
...but why me?

506
00:45:19,256 --> 00:45:23,158
Because you are a good man.

507
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,920
No, really.

508
00:45:27,197 --> 00:45:31,600
Even when you don't know
that people are watching you.

509
00:45:43,513 --> 00:45:45,344
<i>Hello?</i>

510
00:45:46,182 --> 00:45:47,911
Hello?

511
00:45:49,185 --> 00:45:50,482
Hello?

512
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,959
<i>Okay, I can't hear you,</i>
<i>so try back again.</i>

513
00:45:57,994 --> 00:45:59,962
Gonna hang up now.

514
00:46:00,897 --> 00:46:02,660
Bye.

515
00:46:14,744 --> 00:46:16,473
Mr. Thomas?

516
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,614
We're ready for you.

517
00:47:46,403 --> 00:47:48,963
These are beautiful.

518
00:47:49,172 --> 00:47:52,107
Banana peels. Who knew?

519
00:48:19,135 --> 00:48:20,693
Emily?

520
00:49:56,933 --> 00:49:58,833
Can I get a refill?

521
00:50:01,938 --> 00:50:04,236
- Susan?
- Yeah.

522
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,532
How's Ryan?

523
00:50:06,009 --> 00:50:08,978
He's good. He's at his dad's
this weekend.

524
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:15,607
Will you tell him for me that I'm ready
whenever he is for a free lesson?

525
00:50:15,818 --> 00:50:16,910
Yeah, all right.

526
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,384
Things are kind of crazy right now
with school...

527
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:21,386
...but maybe when school's out.

528
00:50:21,591 --> 00:50:24,219
Oh, yeah. That's perfect.

529
00:50:49,886 --> 00:50:51,945
How's the pie?

530
00:50:52,155 --> 00:50:54,988
Oh, it's... It's good.

531
00:50:55,191 --> 00:50:57,216
You gonna ask her out?

532
00:50:58,428 --> 00:50:59,861
The waitress.

533
00:51:03,433 --> 00:51:04,866
No.

534
00:51:05,435 --> 00:51:06,766
You never know.

535
00:51:08,938 --> 00:51:12,430
I don't... I don't think she sees me.

536
00:51:14,844 --> 00:51:16,277
Good night, Ezra.

537
00:51:54,584 --> 00:51:55,881
Hello?

538
00:51:57,787 --> 00:51:59,311
Ben?

539
00:52:00,323 --> 00:52:02,348
Hi, I'm sorry to call so late.

540
00:52:05,495 --> 00:52:09,090
Did...? Did someone
from the IRS contact you?

541
00:52:09,299 --> 00:52:11,096
No.

542
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:12,928
I just...

543
00:52:13,936 --> 00:52:18,202
I was having trouble breathing after
I took Duke for a walk, and I fainted.

544
00:52:18,975 --> 00:52:21,773
<i>An ambulance had to take me</i>
<i>to the hospital.</i>

545
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,940
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

546
00:52:25,148 --> 00:52:27,207
I don't know why I even
called you. I'm sorry.

547
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:30,875
It's just that I have your card
with me, and...

548
00:52:34,957 --> 00:52:36,117
Ben?

549
00:52:39,362 --> 00:52:41,023
Are you still there?

550
00:52:41,998 --> 00:52:43,488
Yes.

551
00:52:47,103 --> 00:52:49,367
Do you ever
think about dying, Ben?

552
00:52:51,674 --> 00:52:53,471
Every now and again.

553
00:52:55,311 --> 00:52:58,280
My face is bluish.

554
00:52:58,481 --> 00:53:01,450
It's not exactly a good sign.

555
00:53:01,651 --> 00:53:04,142
You should try to rest. Just...

556
00:53:04,354 --> 00:53:07,084
Why don't you see
if you can get some sleep?

557
00:53:07,957 --> 00:53:10,152
I like talking to you.

558
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,487
<i>I like talking to you too.</i>

559
00:53:15,732 --> 00:53:18,166
Would you tell me a story, please?

560
00:53:22,472 --> 00:53:24,099
Okay.

561
00:53:26,976 --> 00:53:29,968
All right. Once upon a time...

562
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:34,138
<i>... there was a little boy named...</i>

563
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:38,548
Oh, lucky me, you just got it
on reserve like that. Okay.

564
00:53:39,756 --> 00:53:41,849
Let me guess. His name was Ben.

565
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,221
No, actually,
this little boy's name is Tim.

566
00:53:48,431 --> 00:53:50,797
I like the name Tim.

567
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,797
Go on.

568
00:53:53,002 --> 00:53:55,368
<i>Tim's little brother</i>
<i>was always pestering Tim...</i>

569
00:53:55,571 --> 00:54:01,009
...to make him paper airplanes,
because he was really good at it.

570
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:04,509
But Tim had much bigger
dreams than that.

571
00:54:04,714 --> 00:54:07,376
Okay. Then what happened?

572
00:54:08,117 --> 00:54:10,415
One day, Tim went out
to the backyard...

573
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:15,421
...and he put leaves
and taped branches to his arms...

574
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:17,684
...and started climbing
the big oak tree.

575
00:54:17,894 --> 00:54:21,591
<i>His little brother said,</i>
<i>"Tim, you can't fly."</i>

576
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:24,164
<i>And he said,</i>
<i>"Yeah? You just watch."</i>

577
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:28,497
He got all the way to the top
and jumped.

578
00:54:30,339 --> 00:54:33,308
How tall was this tree?

579
00:54:33,876 --> 00:54:36,743
<i>It was... It was pretty tall.</i>
<i>He broke his arm.</i>

580
00:54:36,946 --> 00:54:39,574
Oh, my God...
This is a horrible story.

581
00:54:39,782 --> 00:54:41,215
Oh, no, no. It gets better.

582
00:54:41,417 --> 00:54:47,049
From that experience,
Tim realized that he wanted to fly.

583
00:54:47,723 --> 00:54:51,318
So he dedicated his life
to making spaceships.

584
00:54:51,527 --> 00:54:54,155
I thought you said
this was a good story.

585
00:54:55,598 --> 00:54:57,361
Oh, well...

586
00:54:58,067 --> 00:54:59,762
Yeah, that is...

587
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:04,037
...until the dragons showed up.

588
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,132
Oh, okay, see,
now it's getting better.

589
00:55:08,344 --> 00:55:11,609
I like dragons.
Especially dragons in space.

590
00:55:11,814 --> 00:55:16,376
Yes, and these were fire-breathing
space dragons...

591
00:55:16,586 --> 00:55:19,248
<i>... with really bad attitudes.</i>

592
00:55:20,156 --> 00:55:22,181
I see.

593
00:55:23,759 --> 00:55:25,021
I have an idea.

594
00:55:25,628 --> 00:55:27,596
<i>Why don't you try to fall asleep...</i>

595
00:55:27,797 --> 00:55:31,631
<i>... and when you do,</i>
<i>I'll just hang up.</i>

596
00:55:33,703 --> 00:55:35,466
Okay.

597
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:38,028
Ben?

598
00:55:39,175 --> 00:55:40,608
Yes.

599
00:55:42,445 --> 00:55:45,243
Thank you for listening.

600
00:55:45,448 --> 00:55:47,348
And for talking.

601
00:55:49,485 --> 00:55:51,544
<i>Try to fall asleep.</i>

602
00:55:56,826 --> 00:55:58,589
Good night, Ben.

603
00:55:59,795 --> 00:56:01,558
Good night, Emily.

604
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:09,701
Emily?

605
00:56:16,612 --> 00:56:18,079
Emily?

606
00:57:11,033 --> 00:57:13,024
I lied to you.

607
00:57:15,404 --> 00:57:18,032
I think about dying every day.

608
00:57:27,383 --> 00:57:32,411
<i>Dr. King to NICU. Dr. Wesley King,</i>
<i>please report to NICU.</i>

609
00:58:14,664 --> 00:58:16,222
Hey.

610
00:58:20,936 --> 00:58:23,404
- Hey.
- Hey.

611
00:58:25,041 --> 00:58:26,474
When did you get here?

612
00:58:29,578 --> 00:58:31,910
Last night, after we talked.

613
00:58:33,516 --> 00:58:35,074
You slept here?

614
00:58:37,219 --> 00:58:39,710
Good morning. How's our patient?

615
00:58:39,922 --> 00:58:41,947
- Morning. Better.
- Good.

616
00:58:42,158 --> 00:58:44,991
- Hello.
- Hi, Ben. Is that right? IRS?

617
00:58:45,194 --> 00:58:46,889
- Yes, how are you?
- Good, thank you.

618
00:58:47,096 --> 00:58:50,122
- I'll leave you two alone.
- No, no, stay, please. Don't go.

619
00:58:50,332 --> 00:58:51,959
He can... He can stay.

620
00:58:52,168 --> 00:58:54,033
Whatever you want.

621
00:58:56,405 --> 00:58:58,464
You fainted because
your heart was too weak...

622
00:58:58,674 --> 00:59:00,437
...to pump enough blood
to your brain.

623
00:59:00,643 --> 00:59:03,578
It's enlarged
and it's starting to shut down.

624
00:59:04,413 --> 00:59:05,641
How long?

625
00:59:06,348 --> 00:59:08,339
It's entirely up to your heart.

626
00:59:08,551 --> 00:59:12,419
Could be six weeks,
could be a month.

627
00:59:13,122 --> 00:59:15,613
But we've upped you to Status 1 B.

628
00:59:17,593 --> 00:59:18,992
At least I'm on the list.

629
00:59:19,528 --> 00:59:23,988
Not only that,
but we're giving you this pager.

630
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,897
And when it goes off,
it means you have a donor.

631
00:59:31,874 --> 00:59:34,001
The inotrope drug I started you on...

632
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:37,338
...it's gonna stabilize your
blood pressure within 24 hours.

633
00:59:38,481 --> 00:59:39,971
Then what?

634
00:59:40,182 --> 00:59:42,173
We wait.

635
00:59:42,785 --> 00:59:46,277
- Can I do that at home?
- Once you're stable, you can.

636
00:59:46,956 --> 00:59:48,480
Okay.

637
01:00:00,002 --> 01:00:04,871
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.

638
01:00:05,074 --> 01:00:08,475
If you want something else,
I can get you something else.

639
01:00:12,448 --> 01:00:14,439
Would you stay?

640
01:00:17,353 --> 01:00:20,015
I mean, unless you have
something else to do.

641
01:00:23,058 --> 01:00:27,358
- I'd really like it if you stayed.
- I don't have anything.

642
01:00:29,398 --> 01:00:31,923
Okay. Okay.

643
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:50,313
Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell is that thing?

644
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:52,544
It's a dog. Just for one night.

645
01:00:52,755 --> 01:00:55,246
No. Hold on, hold on.
I don't give two shits, okay?

646
01:00:55,457 --> 01:00:56,981
We have a dog policy here.

647
01:00:57,193 --> 01:00:59,787
Little dogs only.
Poodles and Shih Tzus.

648
01:00:59,995 --> 01:01:03,328
It's in the contract. It's English
and Spanish for everyone to see.

649
01:01:03,532 --> 01:01:06,126
And besides, that, my friend,
is not a dog.

650
01:01:06,335 --> 01:01:08,326
It's a goddamn horse.

651
01:01:08,537 --> 01:01:12,371
Well, let me know when you add
a horse policy to the contract.

652
01:01:39,401 --> 01:01:40,390
Yes.

653
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:43,297
Mr. Thomas, it's Connie Tepos.

654
01:01:44,373 --> 01:01:45,738
Hey, Connie.

655
01:01:45,941 --> 01:01:48,466
<i>I don't know why I'm calling you...</i>

656
01:01:48,677 --> 01:01:50,941
...but I'm calling you.

657
01:01:51,947 --> 01:01:53,938
You said you could help us and...

658
01:01:54,149 --> 01:01:56,481
Can you really help us?

659
01:01:57,319 --> 01:01:59,719
This just doesn't make any sense.

660
01:02:00,322 --> 01:02:02,620
- What if he finds us?
- He won't.

661
01:02:02,825 --> 01:02:04,315
- What makes you so sure?
- Stop it.

662
01:02:04,526 --> 01:02:06,892
- You don't know him.
- Stop it.

663
01:02:07,096 --> 01:02:09,462
Don't be weak.

664
01:02:09,665 --> 01:02:13,294
- Don't be weak.
- I'm not weak.

665
01:02:15,471 --> 01:02:17,803
I'm strong.

666
01:02:19,408 --> 01:02:22,400
Take this. Take it.

667
01:02:24,346 --> 01:02:26,678
You are gonna start this car...

668
01:02:27,783 --> 01:02:29,751
...and you're gonna go.

669
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:34,985
This is real,
and this is gonna be your new life.

670
01:02:36,025 --> 01:02:38,823
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

671
01:02:39,028 --> 01:02:42,361
Look at those babies.
Look at those babies.

672
01:02:42,564 --> 01:02:44,361
Look how beautiful
those babies are.

673
01:02:44,566 --> 01:02:46,898
I know, I know.

674
01:02:48,003 --> 01:02:49,834
They deserve it.

675
01:02:51,807 --> 01:02:53,638
Okay?

676
01:02:55,311 --> 01:02:58,747
<i>You're headed north up the coast.</i>

677
01:03:22,204 --> 01:03:24,229
Lorena. Lorena.

678
01:03:25,474 --> 01:03:29,706
<i>I've always believed</i>
<i>this place can heal the soul.</i>

679
01:03:34,416 --> 01:03:35,883
Mommy, the ocean.

680
01:03:36,085 --> 01:03:37,814
Yes, the ocean.

681
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:40,511
<i>I hope that proves true for you.</i>

682
01:04:00,342 --> 01:04:04,039
<i>When you sign your name</i>
<i>on the dotted line of the contract...</i>

683
01:04:04,246 --> 01:04:06,806
<i>... you'll own my house outright.</i>

684
01:04:09,818 --> 01:04:12,446
<i>I only ask that you never mention</i>
<i>how you got the house...</i>

685
01:04:12,654 --> 01:04:16,283
<i>... or try to contact me</i>
<i>for any reason.</i>

686
01:04:20,662 --> 01:04:24,496
<i>And if you're wondering why you,</i>
<i>please stop.</i>

687
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:35,003
<i>All I ask is for you</i>
<i>to honor my wishes...</i>

688
01:04:37,146 --> 01:04:41,981
<i>... and, of course,</i>
<i>live life abundantly.</i>

689
01:04:54,363 --> 01:04:56,991
Hey. Thanks. Got it.

690
01:04:57,199 --> 01:04:58,996
Hi, Duke.

691
01:04:59,201 --> 01:05:01,226
Hi, baby.

692
01:05:02,271 --> 01:05:04,466
What time does the nurse come?

693
01:05:04,673 --> 01:05:07,506
She should be there
by the time I get home.

694
01:05:10,746 --> 01:05:13,044
- Ben?
- Yes.

695
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:17,642
I know I'm the girl
with the broken wing.

696
01:05:18,821 --> 01:05:21,119
But who are you?

697
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:22,918
Who am I?

698
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:26,117
I am your friendly neighborhood
tax collector.

699
01:05:26,328 --> 01:05:27,818
Ben.

700
01:05:29,298 --> 01:05:31,858
Where the hell did you come from?

701
01:05:34,636 --> 01:05:37,696
I grew up in Oakland.

702
01:05:38,941 --> 01:05:41,171
Literally. Okay.

703
01:05:43,112 --> 01:05:45,342
Where did you go to college?

704
01:05:45,547 --> 01:05:48,744
As far from Oakland as possible.

705
01:05:49,184 --> 01:05:52,210
Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.

706
01:05:52,421 --> 01:05:54,184
How about you?

707
01:05:54,389 --> 01:05:56,357
UCLA.

708
01:05:57,626 --> 01:05:59,958
You went to MIT?

709
01:06:00,762 --> 01:06:03,526
Like, the MIT?

710
01:06:06,301 --> 01:06:12,171
Oh, and now you're wondering how
I wound up as a lowly tax collector.

711
01:06:12,374 --> 01:06:14,205
Absolutely.

712
01:06:19,181 --> 01:06:24,141
- I sort of stumbled into this job.
- That's a big stumble.

713
01:06:24,953 --> 01:06:26,614
What from?

714
01:06:28,323 --> 01:06:30,621
I always wanted to be an engineer.

715
01:06:31,593 --> 01:06:33,618
An engineer?

716
01:06:35,497 --> 01:06:37,226
What kind?

717
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,896
The kind that sent people
to the moon.

718
01:06:42,237 --> 01:06:43,704
Really?

719
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:45,297
Yes.

720
01:06:45,507 --> 01:06:48,738
I don't wanna talk
about me anymore.

721
01:06:50,012 --> 01:06:54,176
That's too bad,
because you're very interesting.

722
01:07:02,491 --> 01:07:04,152
Have you...?

723
01:07:05,494 --> 01:07:07,485
Have you ever been in love?

724
01:07:08,897 --> 01:07:10,888
Emily, please.

725
01:07:11,667 --> 01:07:13,658
Yes, you have.

726
01:07:13,869 --> 01:07:15,234
Come on, you can tell me.

727
01:07:19,942 --> 01:07:21,671
Yes.

728
01:07:22,044 --> 01:07:24,342
But it ended.

729
01:07:25,314 --> 01:07:28,078
- What happened?
- Stop it.

730
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:30,777
- No, seriously, you can tell...
- Stop it.

731
01:07:33,121 --> 01:07:35,783
You need to get some rest.

732
01:07:36,525 --> 01:07:40,859
I'll call you tomorrow,
or maybe I'll stop by.

733
01:07:43,699 --> 01:07:47,066
No, if I have questions tomorrow,
what then?

734
01:07:48,904 --> 01:07:51,168
That's not a part of the deal.

735
01:07:52,774 --> 01:07:54,833
What the hell does that mean?

736
01:08:15,564 --> 01:08:18,658
Emily, hold on. Hold on.

737
01:08:18,867 --> 01:08:21,893
- Just leave.
- Emily, wait.

738
01:08:22,104 --> 01:08:23,537
Wait!

739
01:08:34,249 --> 01:08:36,615
Thank you for everything you did.

740
01:09:10,018 --> 01:09:11,645
Did you like the eggs?

741
01:09:11,853 --> 01:09:13,821
They were okay, I guess.

742
01:09:14,022 --> 01:09:16,320
I don't like the eggs you buy.

743
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:19,486
Okay.

744
01:09:47,422 --> 01:09:49,754
You're wearing suit pants.

745
01:09:50,692 --> 01:09:52,284
To weed.

746
01:09:52,494 --> 01:09:56,555
Yeah, I didn't... I didn't have
any other clothes with me.

747
01:09:57,165 --> 01:10:00,100
- You know, I was gonna get to those.
- I saw them the other day.

748
01:10:00,302 --> 01:10:04,898
I figured I would just take the day off
and get this done for you.

749
01:10:07,976 --> 01:10:09,307
Ben?

750
01:10:09,511 --> 01:10:10,773
Yeah?

751
01:10:10,979 --> 01:10:13,812
This is a really ridiculous apology.

752
01:10:19,755 --> 01:10:23,350
Come on.
I wanna show you something.

753
01:10:23,558 --> 01:10:25,423
Oh, no, I gotta finish.

754
01:10:27,396 --> 01:10:29,421
You can finish tomorrow.

755
01:10:30,966 --> 01:10:32,593
Come on.

756
01:10:47,549 --> 01:10:49,107
This is where I used to work.

757
01:10:50,485 --> 01:10:53,386
And these are the artifacts
of said work.

758
01:10:53,989 --> 01:10:56,651
Wow, those are great.
How old are they?

759
01:10:58,326 --> 01:11:03,696
This one is just shy of 120 years.

760
01:11:04,232 --> 01:11:09,568
It's how I put out my line of letterpress
cards, wedding invitations, invites.

761
01:11:09,771 --> 01:11:11,534
What about this one?

762
01:11:12,073 --> 01:11:13,938
That youngster...

763
01:11:14,142 --> 01:11:18,909
...is the Heidelberg Windmill, 1956.

764
01:11:19,448 --> 01:11:21,313
Call it "The Beast."

765
01:11:22,017 --> 01:11:24,383
Well, that seems appropriate.

766
01:11:24,853 --> 01:11:27,378
It pooped out on me
about five years ago, though.

767
01:11:27,589 --> 01:11:30,183
And I can't find anybody to fix it.

768
01:11:30,392 --> 01:11:32,826
It's kind of a dying art.

769
01:11:33,028 --> 01:11:35,588
Defibrillator here works, though.

770
01:11:35,797 --> 01:11:38,197
Luckily. It kept my business afloat.
Wanna see how?

771
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,061
Please.

772
01:11:40,669 --> 01:11:44,002
Okay. Now, true pressmen...

773
01:11:44,206 --> 01:11:47,573
...hate that we modern girls...

774
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:50,508
...want a deep impression.

775
01:11:50,712 --> 01:11:55,172
See, for a hundred years, they tried
their damnedest just to kiss it...

776
01:11:55,584 --> 01:11:58,781
...so that it didn't leave
an indentation.

777
01:11:59,788 --> 01:12:03,224
Now it's the only way
to prove it's not digital.

778
01:12:08,163 --> 01:12:10,597
I think it feels richer.

779
01:12:12,968 --> 01:12:14,697
You okay?

780
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,832
Yeah.

781
01:12:18,273 --> 01:12:20,264
Look, Ben...

782
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:27,410
I don't really know anything about you
or where you came from...

783
01:12:28,817 --> 01:12:30,944
...but you keep showing up.

784
01:12:34,189 --> 01:12:35,952
And I'm glad.

785
01:12:37,726 --> 01:12:39,353
Okay.

786
01:12:41,062 --> 01:12:42,996
Okay.

787
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:46,463
So Duke needs a walk.

788
01:12:46,668 --> 01:12:48,363
Are you interested?

789
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:50,765
Yes.

790
01:13:02,517 --> 01:13:04,109
Come on.

791
01:13:05,887 --> 01:13:07,752
Hey, hey.

792
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:10,417
Right here.

793
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:12,354
There you go.

794
01:13:12,961 --> 01:13:15,930
He's like a different dog
with you around.

795
01:13:16,498 --> 01:13:19,262
I don't think we ever
properly bonded.

796
01:13:20,735 --> 01:13:22,965
Why would you get such a big dog?

797
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:33,044
Did you know that Great Danes on
average only live about seven years?

798
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:37,084
They have heart issues.

799
01:13:39,688 --> 01:13:42,020
I think I got him because...

800
01:13:42,657 --> 01:13:45,217
...I thought he could help me
with my illness.

801
01:13:46,094 --> 01:13:48,028
It'd be something
I could take care of...

802
01:13:48,229 --> 01:13:50,891
...as opposed to being
always taken care of.

803
01:13:55,303 --> 01:13:58,670
You know, just so you know,
I used to be really hot.

804
01:14:00,642 --> 01:14:03,509
Like, unauditably hot.

805
01:14:04,112 --> 01:14:06,046
Is that so?

806
01:14:06,247 --> 01:14:07,737
Yeah.

807
01:14:14,823 --> 01:14:17,849
I haven't felt like this
in a really long time.

808
01:14:27,702 --> 01:14:30,296
There's so many things
that I wanna do.

809
01:14:33,575 --> 01:14:35,509
I wanna go on a plane
for 13 hours...

810
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:39,237
...and not have to stress
that I can't reach my doctor.

811
01:14:41,016 --> 01:14:45,715
You know, like, just travel.
Go backpacking, have experiences.

812
01:14:46,521 --> 01:14:48,614
See the world.

813
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:55,095
I just wanna have the time
to figure out who it is that I am.

814
01:14:55,296 --> 01:14:57,491
You know, what I like.

815
01:15:00,201 --> 01:15:03,364
Do things, try things,
get out of my head for once.

816
01:15:07,942 --> 01:15:11,173
I would really like to go running.

817
01:15:13,048 --> 01:15:14,345
I think about that sometimes.

818
01:15:14,549 --> 01:15:18,815
What it would just feel like
to go running.

819
01:15:53,688 --> 01:15:55,383
So...

820
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:57,982
...see you tomorrow?

821
01:15:59,461 --> 01:16:01,019
Yes.

822
01:16:02,197 --> 01:16:07,134
But if you need anything,
just call and I'll come right back.

823
01:16:08,303 --> 01:16:09,861
Okay.

824
01:16:17,145 --> 01:16:18,635
Bye.

825
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:31,990
I had a really great time today.

826
01:16:32,494 --> 01:16:34,257
Me too.

827
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:37,357
Bye.

828
01:20:47,682 --> 01:20:50,674
No anesthetic. You ever
donated bone marrow before?

829
01:20:50,885 --> 01:20:52,750
You're a brave guy.

830
01:20:55,523 --> 01:20:57,855
How long have you
known Nicholas?

831
01:21:07,668 --> 01:21:09,659
What the hell happened to you?

832
01:21:11,672 --> 01:21:14,664
Hey, how much longer
are you gonna stay in my hotel?

833
01:21:14,876 --> 01:21:16,070
Motel.

834
01:21:16,277 --> 01:21:18,142
How much longer?

835
01:21:19,113 --> 01:21:22,082
Actually, I was planning
on dying here.

836
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:25,212
Well, then you need to pay
in advance.

837
01:22:17,138 --> 01:22:18,196
Hello?

838
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:21,832
Hey, it's Emily.

839
01:22:22,043 --> 01:22:23,567
Are you sleeping?

840
01:22:26,013 --> 01:22:28,573
Yes. No.

841
01:22:29,817 --> 01:22:31,250
Is everything okay?

842
01:22:32,353 --> 01:22:34,378
Yeah, I'm fine.

843
01:22:35,623 --> 01:22:38,649
My sister came over for a couple
of days last week with the kids...

844
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:41,328
...and it was really great.

845
01:22:42,663 --> 01:22:45,393
<i>I tried calling you a couple times.</i>

846
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,124
<i>How are you doing?</i>

847
01:22:47,335 --> 01:22:49,132
Yeah, I'm good.

848
01:22:49,337 --> 01:22:52,306
Everything's fine. I've been...

849
01:22:52,874 --> 01:22:56,708
I've been traveling a lot, so...

850
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:01,614
Well, are you busy tonight?

851
01:23:03,417 --> 01:23:04,714
What do you mean?

852
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,513
I don't... Maybe you wanna
come by and say hello?

853
01:23:09,724 --> 01:23:11,555
Around 7?

854
01:23:13,127 --> 01:23:16,255
<i>You don't have to if you don't want to.</i>
<i>I just, you know...</i>

855
01:23:20,368 --> 01:23:24,361
Look, I totally get if you don't wanna
hang out with the dying girl, so...

856
01:23:25,706 --> 01:23:28,834
I can... I can come at 7.

857
01:23:30,411 --> 01:23:32,311
Okay.

858
01:23:33,414 --> 01:23:34,881
Okay.

859
01:23:36,384 --> 01:23:37,942
Bye.

860
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:25,857
- Well, how you doing tonight?
- Hey.

861
01:24:26,067 --> 01:24:28,592
- How you doing?
- Have fun.

862
01:24:29,437 --> 01:24:30,597
- Hi.
- Hi.

863
01:24:31,806 --> 01:24:33,433
Come in.

864
01:24:33,641 --> 01:24:35,905
I am so glad she's gone.

865
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:37,805
Are you okay if we eat outside?

866
01:24:38,212 --> 01:24:39,270
Eating?

867
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,913
You didn't eat already, did you?

868
01:24:41,115 --> 01:24:43,276
- No.
- Okay.

869
01:24:45,486 --> 01:24:46,510
No.

870
01:24:46,721 --> 01:24:49,918
Well, it was a surprise...

871
01:24:50,591 --> 01:24:52,422
...but you're on time.

872
01:24:54,629 --> 01:24:59,965
I haven't cooked anybody food
for years, so you better like it.

873
01:25:00,167 --> 01:25:02,101
Or lie to me.

874
01:25:05,006 --> 01:25:06,564
This is for you.

875
01:25:07,875 --> 01:25:12,278
You don't have to say anything.
I just got it... Change in there.

876
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:16,007
Dinner is ready and you're not.
So hurry up.

877
01:25:17,051 --> 01:25:18,780
Chop-chop.

878
01:26:19,613 --> 01:26:21,308
You look great.

879
01:26:22,149 --> 01:26:24,413
Yeah. It's pink.

880
01:26:24,819 --> 01:26:26,616
It's salmon.

881
01:26:39,567 --> 01:26:41,558
You are so nice.

882
01:26:43,404 --> 01:26:45,065
So are you.

883
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,412
Everything's vegetarian.

884
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:58,079
I hope you like eggplant Parmesan.

885
01:27:02,456 --> 01:27:06,187
I haven't treated myself very well...

886
01:27:06,394 --> 01:27:08,862
...in the past few years.

887
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:12,927
Start now.

888
01:27:20,775 --> 01:27:22,367
All right.

889
01:27:29,984 --> 01:27:31,451
What do you think?

890
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:38,115
It's delicious.

891
01:27:40,728 --> 01:27:42,525
Glad you like it.

892
01:28:22,803 --> 01:28:24,998
Do you wanna hear
my favorite song?

893
01:28:26,106 --> 01:28:28,438
Yes. Are you gonna sing it?

894
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:34,839
No, I can't sing anymore.

895
01:28:35,850 --> 01:28:37,511
Oh, and a performance.

896
01:28:37,718 --> 01:28:39,583
Oh, no.

897
01:29:23,097 --> 01:29:24,826
Shall we?

898
01:29:44,084 --> 01:29:45,779
You need to relax.

899
01:29:46,787 --> 01:29:48,982
This is relaxed.

900
01:30:20,821 --> 01:30:23,221
I have a surprise for you.

901
01:30:25,326 --> 01:30:27,123
Surprise?

902
01:30:27,928 --> 01:30:29,452
Yes.

903
01:30:30,230 --> 01:30:31,697
For me?

904
01:30:34,902 --> 01:30:37,268
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

905
01:30:44,211 --> 01:30:46,975
And open.

906
01:30:51,719 --> 01:30:53,118
Okay.

907
01:31:00,728 --> 01:31:02,753
You cleaned The Beast.

908
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:06,498
Actually, I fixed it.

909
01:31:07,401 --> 01:31:09,130
No, you didn't.

910
01:31:09,336 --> 01:31:11,065
Oh, okay, let's go, then.

911
01:31:11,271 --> 01:31:14,240
Wait. Are you serious?

912
01:31:14,441 --> 01:31:15,965
Try it.

913
01:31:24,485 --> 01:31:26,043
Okay.

914
01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:11,425
Thank you.

915
01:32:51,705 --> 01:32:54,640
Wait right here, okay?

916
01:32:55,008 --> 01:32:57,499
I'll be right back. Wait right here.

917
01:33:00,714 --> 01:33:02,113
One second.

918
01:33:14,027 --> 01:33:15,460
Hey!

919
01:33:16,563 --> 01:33:18,360
Tell me what's going on.

920
01:33:18,899 --> 01:33:20,196
- Now!
- All right.

921
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,527
Ben, you need to go home.

922
01:33:22,736 --> 01:33:26,672
Do you know they keep a full history of
every inquiry a revenue officer makes?

923
01:33:26,874 --> 01:33:28,603
- You understand?
- Keep your voice down.

924
01:33:28,809 --> 01:33:31,937
- Just keep your voice down.
- No. What you are doing is a crime!

925
01:33:32,146 --> 01:33:34,637
You are impersonating
a federal officer. It's a felony!

926
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:36,042
All right. Listen.

927
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:39,686
You can't play with people's lives.
Do you understand that?

928
01:33:39,887 --> 01:33:43,050
All right.
All right, there's a coffee shop.

929
01:33:43,257 --> 01:33:45,282
There's a coffee shop
near where I'm staying.

930
01:33:45,492 --> 01:33:48,052
- Tomorrow we'll sit down...
- Where are you staying, Tim?

931
01:33:48,262 --> 01:33:50,787
Tell me, because I don't know
where my brother lives!

932
01:33:52,065 --> 01:33:53,657
A motel. Five blocks from here.

933
01:33:53,867 --> 01:33:56,131
We'll sit down tomorrow morning,
I guarantee it.

934
01:33:56,336 --> 01:33:59,066
Where are my credentials?
Give me my credentials back.

935
01:34:05,746 --> 01:34:08,237
Here it is. Here. Here.

936
01:34:10,017 --> 01:34:11,541
Just go home.

937
01:34:11,752 --> 01:34:14,880
You have a beautiful family.
Go home and enjoy them.

938
01:34:15,088 --> 01:34:17,318
Tim, Tim, Tim,
why are you even here?

939
01:34:17,524 --> 01:34:20,186
Tell me, who is Emily Posa?

940
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:24,955
I'll explain everything tomorrow.

941
01:34:30,604 --> 01:34:32,697
Look, give me your car keys.

942
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,973
I'm not going anywhere.

943
01:34:42,716 --> 01:34:44,684
I'm gonna be right here.

944
01:34:46,119 --> 01:34:50,112
So you remember I love you and...

945
01:34:51,725 --> 01:34:53,955
Tim, don't make me come knock
on the door, okay?

946
01:35:20,821 --> 01:35:25,019
I didn't realize how late it was and...

947
01:35:27,794 --> 01:35:31,662
I have a really long drive,
so I need to go.

948
01:35:35,369 --> 01:35:37,337
I don't wanna keep lying to you.

949
01:35:38,572 --> 01:35:41,769
I don't wanna... Wait, Emily.

950
01:37:42,195 --> 01:37:44,390
Do you wanna play a game?

951
01:37:46,099 --> 01:37:47,726
What game?

952
01:37:50,737 --> 01:37:52,671
The "what if" game.

953
01:37:54,207 --> 01:37:56,903
The "what if" game.

954
01:37:58,378 --> 01:38:00,243
What if...

955
01:38:01,782 --> 01:38:03,909
...my pager goes off...

956
01:38:06,853 --> 01:38:08,878
...and it's a heart...

957
01:38:10,023 --> 01:38:11,991
...and...

958
01:38:12,926 --> 01:38:14,723
...it works?

959
01:38:16,363 --> 01:38:19,059
And my body doesn't reject it?

960
01:38:21,368 --> 01:38:23,233
And...

961
01:38:27,741 --> 01:38:30,039
...what if I have time?

962
01:38:43,523 --> 01:38:45,320
What if?

963
01:38:50,363 --> 01:38:52,888
What if we have children?

964
01:38:58,438 --> 01:39:00,770
What if we got married?

965
01:39:14,721 --> 01:39:16,382
I love you.

966
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:18,956
- I love you too.
- I love you.

967
01:41:14,741 --> 01:41:16,299
Hi.

968
01:41:16,810 --> 01:41:19,643
Is Dr. Briar on duty tonight?

969
01:41:20,447 --> 01:41:21,971
She's doing her rounds.

970
01:41:22,182 --> 01:41:24,946
Can you tell her it's Ben Thomas?

971
01:41:25,652 --> 01:41:26,641
It's very important.

972
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:30,121
- I'll... I'll page her.
- Thank you.

973
01:41:32,225 --> 01:41:35,160
Dr. Briar to the nurses' station.

974
01:42:00,754 --> 01:42:02,244
Hey.

975
01:42:03,189 --> 01:42:06,283
- Is it Emily?
- No, no.

976
01:42:07,861 --> 01:42:09,522
I'm sorry.

977
01:42:11,431 --> 01:42:12,830
It's...

978
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:14,894
Is there?

979
01:42:17,203 --> 01:42:18,693
I'm sorry.

980
01:42:19,239 --> 01:42:23,437
Do you have any more optimism...

981
01:42:23,643 --> 01:42:26,203
...about Emily...

982
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:29,144
...than you did the other day?

983
01:42:29,849 --> 01:42:31,248
Ben...

984
01:42:32,285 --> 01:42:37,245
...when you're looking for a donor
with a rare blood type...

985
01:42:38,625 --> 01:42:40,217
...the odds go way down.

986
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:42,350
To what?

987
01:42:43,296 --> 01:42:45,355
They go down. What's the...?

988
01:42:45,565 --> 01:42:47,556
Give me a percentage.

989
01:42:48,835 --> 01:42:50,530
Give me a number.

990
01:42:51,538 --> 01:42:53,768
Three, 5 percent.

991
01:42:54,874 --> 01:42:57,399
I know. I'm sorry.
I wish the numbers were higher.

992
01:42:57,610 --> 01:43:00,010
- Thank you. Thank you.
- I do.

993
01:43:46,059 --> 01:43:47,219
Hello?

994
01:43:47,927 --> 01:43:49,451
Dan.

995
01:43:50,397 --> 01:43:52,092
It's time.

996
01:43:52,799 --> 01:43:54,357
I love you.

997
01:44:51,090 --> 01:44:53,854
<i>1:38 a.m.</i>

998
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:58,158
Hello?

999
01:44:58,364 --> 01:45:00,195
Ezra.

1000
01:45:02,635 --> 01:45:04,933
My name is Ben Thomas.

1001
01:45:06,673 --> 01:45:09,665
I called you a few weeks ago.
You probably don't remember.

1002
01:45:11,110 --> 01:45:14,045
I do remember.

1003
01:45:14,247 --> 01:45:17,216
<i>I wanna apologize for being</i>
<i>so cruel to you...</i>

1004
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:19,775
...but I had to be certain.

1005
01:45:20,787 --> 01:45:24,223
I had to be certain
that you were a decent man. Kind.

1006
01:45:24,424 --> 01:45:27,916
- <i>Slow to anger.</i>
- What do you want from me?

1007
01:45:28,928 --> 01:45:31,123
I wanna give you a gift.

1008
01:45:32,232 --> 01:45:35,929
You're gonna be contacted
by a man named Dan Morris.

1009
01:45:36,970 --> 01:45:39,063
<i>You can trust him.</i>

1010
01:45:39,272 --> 01:45:41,570
Was that you at the diner?

1011
01:45:43,476 --> 01:45:44,602
Goodbye.

1012
01:46:07,133 --> 01:46:09,226
<i>911 emergency.</i>

1013
01:46:13,673 --> 01:46:15,436
I need an ambulance.

1014
01:46:15,642 --> 01:46:20,204
<i>I have you at 9212 West Third Street</i>
<i>in Los Angeles.</i>

1015
01:46:23,416 --> 01:46:25,407
Yes, room number 2.

1016
01:46:26,152 --> 01:46:28,279
<i>What's the emergency?</i>

1017
01:46:30,723 --> 01:46:32,918
There's been a suicide.

1018
01:46:33,126 --> 01:46:34,923
<i>Who's the victim?</i>

1019
01:46:36,896 --> 01:46:38,261
I am.

1020
01:46:40,199 --> 01:46:42,861
You are gonna need to stop
looking at that thing so much.

1021
01:46:43,069 --> 01:46:45,731
Why? Is it gonna crack?

1022
01:46:45,939 --> 01:46:48,533
Oh, no. I paid extra
for the non-cracking kind.

1023
01:46:48,741 --> 01:46:50,436
I bet you did.

1024
01:46:51,210 --> 01:46:54,236
- Why don't you just turn that off?
- I know. No more. No more work.

1025
01:46:54,447 --> 01:46:56,074
I'm done. Almost done. Almost done.

1026
01:46:56,282 --> 01:46:57,806
Tim!

1027
01:49:53,159 --> 01:49:54,183
I have procedures.

1028
01:49:54,393 --> 01:49:57,851
I understand, but she needs
that heart or she will die.

1029
01:50:19,085 --> 01:50:21,781
- Ben?
- One, two, three.

1030
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:36,061
Hey.

1031
01:50:36,469 --> 01:50:38,528
How you doing?

1032
01:52:45,831 --> 01:52:49,028
About a year after the accident,
I got sick.

1033
01:52:50,503 --> 01:52:54,769
I got lung cancer,
and I needed a double-lobe transplant.

1034
01:52:56,375 --> 01:52:59,139
Tim could only give me one,
of course.

1035
01:52:59,946 --> 01:53:02,813
It must have planted a seed,
because he...

1036
01:53:04,216 --> 01:53:06,446
About six months later...

1037
01:53:08,387 --> 01:53:11,845
...he donated the right part of his
liver to this woman.

1038
01:53:15,161 --> 01:53:18,255
Her name is Holly.

1039
01:55:59,158 --> 01:56:02,150
I'm proud of you kids. Very proud.

1040
01:56:02,361 --> 01:56:05,057
Good job. Good job.

1041
01:56:05,264 --> 01:56:07,232
- Ezra.
- Yeah.

1042
01:56:07,433 --> 01:56:08,832
Hi.

1043
01:56:10,669 --> 01:56:13,502
Are you a parent?

1044
01:56:13,706 --> 01:56:15,003
No.

1045
01:56:16,842 --> 01:56:18,742
Have we met?

1046
01:56:24,150 --> 01:56:25,742
You okay?

1047
01:56:39,598 --> 01:56:41,361
You must be Emily.

1048
01:56:47,506 --> 01:56:49,064
