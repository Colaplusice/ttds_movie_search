1
00:01:03,283 --> 00:01:04,243
Copy boy!

2
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:08,966
- Make it snappy.
- Where's the rest of this story?

3
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:10,286
<i>Morning Post.</i>

4
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,088
City desk? Just a moment.

5
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:16,050
If anybody asks,
I'm at the courthouse.

6
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,172
- Elevator!
- Going down.

7
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:25,296
- Hello, Hildy.
- Hi, Skinny.

8
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,298
Hello, Ruth, Maisie.

9
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:31,619
- Is the lord of the universe in?
- Yes, in a bad humour.

10
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,062
Somebody stole
the crown jewels.

11
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:35,664
- Shall we announce you?
- I'll blow my own horn.

12
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:38,826
Bruce, wait.
I'll be back in ten.

13
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:42,268
Ten minutes is a long time
to be away from you.

14
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:44,389
What did you say?

15
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:48,031
Go on.

16
00:01:49,112 --> 00:01:50,073
Well, go ahead.

17
00:01:50,353 --> 00:01:53,635
Even ten minutes is a long time
to be away from you.

18
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:58,189
I like it. That's why I asked
you to say it again.

19
00:01:57,758 --> 00:02:01,499
I like being spoiled. The man
I'm going to see did very little of it.

20
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,002
I'd like to spoil him.
Want me to go with you?

21
00:02:04,203 --> 00:02:07,249
- I can handle it.
- If it gets rough, I'm here.

22
00:02:06,764 --> 00:02:08,686
I'll come running, partner.

23
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:11,087
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, Hildy!

24
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:13,500
- How are you?
- Welcome back.

25
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,730
Hello, Hildy, how have you been?

26
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:19,573
Beatrice, how's
"Advice to the Lovelorn"?

27
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:22,950
- Fine. My cat had kittens again.
- Your fault.

28
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:24,856
Glad to see you. Hi, Jim.

29
00:02:25,138 --> 00:02:26,858
Mildred, you still around?

30
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,100
A little more around the chin, boss.

31
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:34,623
- What do you want?
- Your ex-wife is here.

32
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:38,306
Hello, Hildy.

33
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,907
- Hello, Walter.
- Hi.

34
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:43,189
Hi, Louie.
How's the slot-machine king?

35
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:46,632
I ain't doing that no more.
I'm retired. Know what I mean?

36
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:49,129
- Walter.
- I'm busy!

37
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:52,034
The governor didn't sign
that reprieve.

38
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:56,158
Tomorrow, Earl Williams dies
and makes a sucker out of us.

39
00:02:56,158 --> 00:02:57,799
What are you gonna do?

40
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,520
- Phone the governor.
- I can't.

41
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,242
- Why not?
- He's out fishing.

42
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,724
- How many places to fish are there?
- Two. Atlantic and Pacific.

43
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,840
That simplifies it.

44
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,086
- Get him.
- And say what?

45
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:10,287
Quiet, Duffy. He's thinking.

46
00:03:11,248 --> 00:03:14,330
If he reprieves Williams,
we'll support him for senator.

47
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,532
<i>Tell him the Morning Post
will back him.</i>

48
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:17,692
- You can't.
- Why?

49
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:20,254
We're a democratic paper.

50
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,336
After we get the reprieve,
we'll be democratic again.

51
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:27,859
<i>Get going. The Morning Post
expects every editor to do his duty.</i>

52
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:31,010
You too, Louie.
Get out of here.

53
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:37,385
Walter, I see you're still at it.

54
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:40,628
First time I cheated a governor.
What can I do for you?

55
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:43,090
Would you mind if I sat down?

56
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:45,700
There's a lamp burning in the
window for you. Here.

57
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:50,140
I jumped out of that window
a long time ago, Walter.

58
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:53,317
May I have one of those?

59
00:03:54,557 --> 00:03:55,917
Thank you.

60
00:03:58,118 --> 00:03:59,760
And a match?

61
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,882
Thank you.

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,686
- How long is it?
- How long is what?

63
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:09,926
You know what.

64
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:12,879
How long is it since
we've seen each other?

65
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:15,210
Well, let's see.

66
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,254
I spent six weeks in Reno,
then Bermuda. About four months.

67
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,895
Seems like yesterday.

68
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:25,578
Maybe it was yesterday, Hildy.
Been seeing me in your dreams?

69
00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:28,780
Mama doesn't dream about you.
You wouldn't know her now.

70
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,981
Yes, I would.
I'd know you anytime.

71
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:33,262
"Anyplace, anywhere."

72
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,345
You're repeating yourself.
You said that when you proposed.

73
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:37,706
You still remember it.

74
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:40,667
If I didn't remember it,
I wouldn't have divorced you.

75
00:04:40,868 --> 00:04:42,109
I sort of wish you hadn't.

76
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:44,230
- What?
- Divorced me.

77
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,833
It makes a fellow lose faith. It gives
him a feeling he wasn't wanted.

78
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:51,034
That's what divorces are for.

79
00:04:51,235 --> 00:04:54,317
Nonsense, you've got an old-fashioned
idea divorces last forever.

80
00:04:54,597 --> 00:04:57,879
"Till death do us part."
Divorce doesn't mean anything.

81
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,561
Just a few words mumbled by a judge.

82
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:03,363
We've got something
nothing can change.

83
00:05:04,123 --> 00:05:07,085
- I suppose you're right, in a way.
- Sure.

84
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:10,088
- I am fond of you, you know.
- Thattagirl!

85
00:05:10,248 --> 00:05:13,329
I often wish you weren't
such a stinker.

86
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,331
You must meet my mother.
She'd like that.

87
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:21,135
Why'd you promise not to fight
the divorce and then gum up the works?

88
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:23,136
I meant to let you go, but...

89
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:25,617
...you never miss the water
till the well runs dry.

90
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:28,619
A big lummox like you,
hiring an airplane to write:

91
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,663
"Hildy, don't be hasty.
Remember my dimple. Walter."

92
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:35,224
It delayed our divorce
while the judge watched it.

93
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,387
I've still got the dimple,
and in the same place.

94
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,629
I acted like a husband who didn't
want his home broken.

95
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:45,310
- What home?
- Remember the home I promised you?

96
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,153
Sure I do. That was the one we were
to have right after the honeymoon.

97
00:05:49,354 --> 00:05:50,595
That honeymoon!

98
00:05:50,794 --> 00:05:54,157
Was it my fault? Did I know that
coal mine would have a cave-in?

99
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:57,038
I intended to be with you
on our honeymoon.

100
00:05:57,239 --> 00:06:00,321
Instead of two weeks in Atlantic City
with my bridegroom...

101
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:03,683
...I spent two weeks in a mine
with John Kruptzky.

102
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:04,924
You deny it?

103
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:07,526
We beat the whole country
on that story!

104
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:10,608
That isn't what I got married for!

105
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:13,009
Oh, what is the good?
Look, Walter.

106
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,731
I came to tell you to stop
phoning me a dozen times a day...

107
00:06:16,932 --> 00:06:18,373
...sending me 20 telegrams...

108
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:22,215
- I write a beautiful telegram.
- Are you gonna listen?

109
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,097
What's the use of fighting?
I'll tell you what you do.

110
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:28,380
Come back to work on the paper,
and if we can't get along...

111
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,301
...we'll get married again.

112
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,063
- What?
- I haven't any hard feelings.

113
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:36,650
Walter, you're wonderful,
in a loathsome sort of way.

114
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,908
- Be quiet so I can say what I have to.
- Tell me over lunch.

115
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:41,690
I have a lunch date.

116
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:42,670
- Break it.
- I can't.

117
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,791
Hands off!
Are you playing osteopath?

118
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,152
Temper, temper.

119
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,555
You are no longer my husband
and no longer my boss.

120
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:51,995
And you won't be my boss.

121
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:55,170
- What does that mean?
- Just what I say.

122
00:06:54,677 --> 00:06:56,238
You're not coming back to work?

123
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:58,800
You're right for
the first time today.

124
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,600
- Got a better offer?
- You bet.

125
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:04,564
Go on, work for somebody else!
That's the gratitude I get.

126
00:07:04,764 --> 00:07:05,725
Stop hamming.

127
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:09,687
Five years ago, you were a college girl.
I took a doll-faced hick!

128
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,609
You wouldn't have
if I wasn't doll-faced.

129
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:15,051
It was a novelty to have a face
to look at without shuddering.

130
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:18,613
I made you a great reporter.
You won't be as good on another paper.

131
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:21,575
We're a team.
The paper needs both of us!

132
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,216
Sold American!

133
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,898
- All right, go ahead.
- Listen, Walter, please.

134
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:29,381
The paper's gonna have to get along
without me. So will you.

135
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:30,701
It didn't work out.

136
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:34,744
It would have if you'd been
satisfied as editor and reporter.

137
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:36,865
But you had to marry me.

138
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:40,028
I wasn't satisfied?
I suppose I proposed to you!

139
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:42,829
Practically!
Making eyes at me until I broke down.

140
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:46,352
"Oh, Walter!"
I was tight when I proposed to you.

141
00:07:46,552 --> 00:07:49,714
If you'd been a gentleman,
you'd have forgotten it.

142
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:53,757
You used to pitch better than that.
Hello. What?

143
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:55,958
Sweeney? What can I do for you?

144
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:58,840
What?
I'm not Sweeney. I'm Duffy.

145
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,842
You can't do that.
Not today, of all days!

146
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:04,323
What's the matter with you?
Are you loony?

147
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,367
Now, listen, Sweeney.
This is no time...

148
00:08:09,807 --> 00:08:14,330
All right, I suppose so.
If you have to, you have to.

149
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,732
- He had to.
- Everything happens to me.

150
00:08:16,932 --> 00:08:19,894
365 days in a year,
and this has to be the day.

151
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:21,135
What's wrong?

152
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,296
- Sweeney.
- Dead?

153
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:26,058
He might as well be.
He picks today to have a baby!

154
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:28,390
Not on purpose?

155
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,142
He's supposed to cover the
Earl Williams case, and where is he?

156
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:33,822
Walking around a hospital.
Is there no honour?

157
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:35,544
Haven't you got anybody else?

158
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:40,827
Nobody else on the paper can write.
This'll break me. Unless...

159
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:42,269
Hildy.

160
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:45,350
- You can help me.
- Not a chance.

161
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:48,031
- Get out, Duffy!
- Save your breath.

162
00:08:48,232 --> 00:08:51,795
- This'll bring us together again.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

163
00:08:52,076 --> 00:08:55,237
This is bigger than anything.
Do it for the paper.

164
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,189
Scram, Svengali.

165
00:08:56,677 --> 00:09:00,809
If not for love, how about money?
I'll raise you $25 a week.

166
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,881
Listen to me, you baboon...

167
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:04,843
- I'll make it $35 and not a cent more.
- Listen!

168
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:07,925
- How much will the other paper pay?
- There's no other paper.

169
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,087
The raise is off.
You get your old salary.

170
00:09:11,288 --> 00:09:13,009
Trying to blackjack me.

171
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,730
- I'm busy.
- Look at it.

172
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,293
Do you know what it is?
It's an engagement ring.

173
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:21,934
Engagement ring?

174
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:28,980
I tried to tell you right away,
but you would start reminiscing.

175
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,624
I'm getting married and as far away
from newspapers as I can get.

176
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:37,225
- What?
- I'm through.

177
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:40,587
- You can get married, you can't quit.
- No? Why not?

178
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,308
I know what it would do.

179
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:44,350
- What?
- It would kill you.

180
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:47,712
- You can't sell me that.
- You're a newspaperman.

181
00:09:47,872 --> 00:09:50,593
I wanna go where I can be a woman.

182
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,795
- You mean a traitor.
- Traitor to what?

183
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:54,918
To journalism.
You're a journalist!

184
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:57,318
A journalist?
What does that mean?

185
00:09:58,189 --> 00:10:00,201
Peeking through keyholes,
chasing fire engines...

186
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,882
...waking people up
to ask them questions...

187
00:10:03,082 --> 00:10:06,850
...stealing pictures off old ladies?
I know about reporters.

188
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:09,206
Buttinskies running around
with no money, and why?

189
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,730
So a million people will know
what's going on. Why, I...

190
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:15,730
What's the use?

191
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,132
You wouldn't know
what it means...

192
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:23,055
...to want to be respectable and
live a halfway normal life.

193
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:25,737
The point is, I'm through.

194
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,139
- Where did you meet this man?
- Bermuda.

195
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:31,620
Rich?

196
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:34,943
He's not what you'd call rich.
He makes $5000 a year.

197
00:10:35,063 --> 00:10:37,665
- What's his line?
- He's in the insurance business.

198
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:40,908
- Insurance business?
- That's a good, honest business, right?

199
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,909
Sure, it's honest.
It's also adventurous.

200
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:47,552
I can't picture you
being surrounded by policies...

201
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:50,750
I can, and I like it, what's more.

202
00:10:50,514 --> 00:10:52,915
He forgets the office
when he's with me.

203
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:56,278
He doesn't treat me like an
errand boy, but like a woman.

204
00:10:56,557 --> 00:10:59,360
How did I treat you?
Like a water buffalo?

205
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,322
I don't know from buffaloes.
I know about him.

206
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:04,644
He's kind, sweet
and considerate.

207
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:06,764
He wants a home and children.

208
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:09,646
Sounds like a guy I should marry.
His name?

209
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:11,769
Baldwin. Bruce Baldwin.

210
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:15,971
I knew a Baldwin once, a horse thief.
Couldn't be the same fella, could it?

211
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:20,093
You're not talking about the man
I'm marrying tomorrow.

212
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,576
Tomorrow? As soon as that?

213
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:30,780
At last, I got out what
I came up here to tell you.

214
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:35,183
Guess there isn't any more
to the story.

215
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:36,544
So long, Walter.

216
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:37,865
So long, Hildy.

217
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:39,706
Better luck next time.

218
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,548
Thanks.

219
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:49,232
Well, you kind of took
the wind out of my sail.

220
00:11:49,394 --> 00:11:54,197
I just want to wish you
everything I couldn't give you.

221
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:59,321
This other fellow. I'm sorry
I didn't get a chance to see him.

222
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:02,562
I'm particular about
whom my wife marries.

223
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:04,004
Where is he?

224
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:07,284
He's right on the job,
waiting for me out there.

225
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:09,286
Do you mind if I meet him?

226
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:12,369
- It wouldn't do any good.
- You're not afraid?

227
00:12:12,568 --> 00:12:13,529
Of course not.

228
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,092
Let's see this paragon.
Is he as good as you say?

229
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:18,212
He's better.

230
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,534
- What does he want with you?
- You got me.

231
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:22,655
Back in an hour, Mildred.

232
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:25,898
I am sorry.
I suppose Bruce... What's his name?

233
00:12:26,097 --> 00:12:29,941
- I suppose he opens doors for you?
- And with a lady, he takes his hat off.

234
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,501
I am sorry.

235
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:33,582
When he walks with a lady,
he waits for her.

236
00:12:33,783 --> 00:12:35,904
In that case...

237
00:12:37,545 --> 00:12:38,866
Allow me.

238
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:45,591
I can see my wife picked out
the right husband for herself.

239
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:49,129
There must be a mistake.
I'm already married.

240
00:12:48,673 --> 00:12:50,114
Already married?

241
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:54,917
You should have told me.
Congratulations again.

242
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:56,158
- No, my name...
- Mr. Burns.

243
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,159
I'm busy.
What did you say, Mr. Baldwin?

244
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,081
- Mr. Burns.
- My name is...

245
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,322
I'm busy with Mr. Baldwin.
I didn't hear you.

246
00:13:04,524 --> 00:13:06,084
- My name is...
- Mr. Burns...

247
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,165
- What is it?
- I'm Bruce Baldwin.

248
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,567
Can't you see I'm...?
You're Bruce Baldwin!

249
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:12,129
Who is he?
Who are you?

250
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:13,850
My name's Pete Davis.

251
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:16,331
Mr. Davis, is this
any concern of yours?

252
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:18,932
From now on, keep your nose
out of my affairs.

253
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:20,855
Don't let it happen again.

254
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:24,976
I'm terribly sorry about this mistake.
This is indeed a pleasure.

255
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:29,300
That's wrong, isn't it? Bruce...
Do you mind if I call you Bruce?

256
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,101
- We're almost related.
- No, not at all.

257
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:34,703
You see, my wife...
That is, your wife.

258
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:38,066
Hildy, you led me to expect you
were marrying a much older man.

259
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:40,067
What did I say?

260
00:13:40,268 --> 00:13:44,110
Don't worry. I realize
you didn't mean old in years.

261
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:48,232
- You always carry an umbrella?
- It looked cloudy.

262
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,914
That's right.
Rubbers too, I hope.

263
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:53,515
Thattaboy!
A man ought to be prepared.

264
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:55,156
We'd better run along.

265
00:13:55,237 --> 00:13:56,999
- We'd better go.
- Where?

266
00:13:57,158 --> 00:13:59,081
To lunch.
Didn't you tell him?

267
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,520
No, she didn't.

268
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:03,802
I guess she just wanted
to surprise you, Bruce.

269
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:04,845
After you, Hildy.

270
00:14:05,164 --> 00:14:06,884
You're wasting your time.

271
00:14:07,086 --> 00:14:09,567
No, I'm glad to do it.

272
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:14,770
Hello, Gus.

273
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,091
It's Hildy!

274
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:19,093
- None other. How are things?
- Can't complain.

275
00:14:19,254 --> 00:14:21,375
I can. I'm hungry.
A roast beef sandwich...

276
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:22,935
- Sorry.
...on white bread.

277
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,376
Over there, Bruce.

278
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:26,577
- And you, Hildy?
- I'll have the same.

279
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:29,340
- You, sir?
- That's all right for me.

280
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,862
Bring some mustard too, Gus.

281
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:36,665
So you two are gonna get married?

282
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:39,547
- How does it feel, Bruce?
- Awful good.

283
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:42,789
- You're getting a great girl.
- I realize that.

284
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:45,110
Things have been different
since I met Hildy.

285
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,511
I've never met anyone like her.

286
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:49,514
Everybody else I've known...

287
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:53,275
...you could tell ahead of time
what they'd say or do.

288
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:57,119
But Hildy's not like that.
You can't tell that about her.

289
00:14:57,318 --> 00:14:58,360
That's nice.

290
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,160
You're getting a great
newspaperman too.

291
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:02,600
No orchids, Walter.

292
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:06,245
One of the best I ever knew.
Sorry to see her go.

293
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:08,846
- I'd like to believe you.
- I mean it.

294
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:12,288
- If you ever want to come back...
- Which I won't.

295
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:15,770
In spite of it all,
there's only one man I'd work for.

296
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,972
I'd kill you if you
worked for anybody else.

297
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:22,576
- Hear that? That's my diploma.
- It must be quite a business...

298
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:25,857
- Are you sure you wanna quit?
- What do you mean?

299
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:29,221
If there is any doubt
or if there's anything...

300
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,342
No, this is your chance to have
a home and to be a human being.

301
00:15:33,543 --> 00:15:35,544
I'll make you take that chance.

302
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:38,225
Certainly.
Why, I wouldn't let her stay.

303
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:42,549
She deserves all this happiness.
All the things I couldn't give her.

304
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:46,312
- All she ever wanted was a home.
- I'll certainly try.

305
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:47,552
I know you will.

306
00:15:47,832 --> 00:15:48,992
- Where will you live?
- Albany.

307
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:52,076
- Got a family up there?
- Just my mother.

308
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:54,756
Your mother.
You'll live with her?

309
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:56,958
Just for the first year.

310
00:15:57,158 --> 00:15:58,199
That will be nice.

311
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,042
Yes, a home with Mother,
in Albany too.

312
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:05,725
Nice little town.
It's the state capital.

313
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:08,687
I know. We were there once.

314
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:16,319
Remember the night
you brought the governor to the hotel?

315
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:20,539
You see, I was in taking a bath.
Well, I came walking out without...

316
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:23,976
She didn't know I was in town.

317
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:27,139
Bruce, how is business up there?
Any better?

318
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,340
Albany's a good insurance town.

319
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,742
People take it out
pretty early in life.

320
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:35,384
- I can see why they would.
- Statistics show that most...

321
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:38,947
I've got a feeling I ought to
have taken out a little insurance.

322
00:16:39,146 --> 00:16:42,108
That really doesn't matter
now that Hildy and I have...

323
00:16:42,308 --> 00:16:44,711
...well, you know, we've...
Does it?

324
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,151
What do you think?

325
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,740
It might have been a good idea
if I had taken out insurance.

326
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,155
I feel that way.

327
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:53,917
I'm in one business
that really helps people.

328
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:58,799
Of course, we don't help you much
while you're alive, but afterward.

329
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,209
- That's what counts.
- Sure.

330
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,923
- I don't get it.
- Nice going.

331
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,924
Sorry, Gus.
My foot slipped.

332
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:08,726
That's all right.
What would you like to drink?

333
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:09,887
Coffee.

334
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:12,088
- Shall I put rum in the coffee?
- Sure.

335
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:13,609
Me too, Gus, please.

336
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,919
- Not for me.
- Go on, Bruce.

337
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,013
I have a lot to do. I have to
buy the tickets, check the baggage...

338
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:20,949
Do it tomorrow.

339
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:25,379
We're leaving today at 4:00,
taking the sleeper for Albany.

340
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,100
Oh, you're leaving today at 4:00?

341
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,581
- That's only two hours.
- That's not much time.

342
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:33,503
I've got a lot to do.

343
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:36,385
Isn't that silly?
All down over my front.

344
00:17:36,584 --> 00:17:39,547
- That's nothing new. Here.
- I'll get Gus.

345
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:41,948
Do something
about this, will you?

346
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:44,830
Call me to the phone when
I sit down.

347
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,552
Thanks, Gus, that's fine.

348
00:17:47,712 --> 00:17:50,513
I'm terribly sorry about that.
That was silly.

349
00:17:50,594 --> 00:17:53,676
Let me get that straight.
I must have misunderstood you.

350
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:57,038
You're taking the sleeper today,
then marrying tomorrow?

351
00:17:57,238 --> 00:18:00,499
- Well, it's not like that.
- What is it like?

352
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,521
Poor Walter.
He'll toss and turn all night.

353
00:18:02,722 --> 00:18:05,123
Better tell him Mother's coming too.

354
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:08,366
- Your mother kicked the bucket...
- No, my mother.

355
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:11,088
Your mother?
That relieves my mind.

356
00:18:11,248 --> 00:18:13,089
It was cruel to let you suffer so.

357
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:15,691
Isn't Walter sweet?
Always wanting to protect me.

358
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:19,052
I wasn't much of a husband,
but you can count on me.

359
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:22,976
I don't think she'll need you much.
I aim to do the protecting.

360
00:18:23,175 --> 00:18:24,897
Mr. Burns, telephone.

361
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:26,258
For me?

362
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,698
That's strange.

363
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:29,609
Pardon me.

364
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:33,543
He's not such a bad guy.

365
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:36,544
No, he should make
some girl real happy.

366
00:18:36,705 --> 00:18:37,785
Slaphappy.

367
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,747
He's not the man for you,
I can see that.

368
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:43,149
But I like him.
He's got charm.

369
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:46,991
He comes by it naturally.
His grandfather was a snake.

370
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:50,554
Hello? Duffy, listen.

371
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,516
Any way we can stop the 4:00 train
to Albany?

372
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,237
<i>- We might dynamite it.
- Could we?</i>

373
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:59,499
Maybe we couldn't.
All right, get this.

374
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,122
Send Sweeney out of town on
two weeks' vacation right away.

375
00:19:03,323 --> 00:19:05,844
Keep your shirt on.
Hildy's coming back.

376
00:19:06,004 --> 00:19:08,525
She doesn't know it,
but she's staying.

377
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:12,368
Tell Louie to stick around.
I may need him. Goodbye.

378
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,250
Thanks, Gus.

379
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,252
- This is bad business.
- What is it?

380
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:20,134
- The Earl Williams case.
- I read about that.

381
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:21,294
It's pretty bad.

382
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:24,369
- What's the lowdown?
- Simple.

383
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:27,058
Poor dope lost his job,
went berserk and shot a cop.

384
00:19:27,258 --> 00:19:28,980
They'll hang him tomorrow.

385
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,542
- What a shame.
- Your paper has been taking his side.

386
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:35,984
If he was crazy, why doesn't
the state put him away?

387
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:39,267
It was a coloured policeman.
You know what that means.

388
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:43,108
- The coloured vote's important.
- Especially with an election coming.

389
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:45,791
That mayor would hang his
grandmother to be reelected.

390
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:48,113
You could show the man
wasn't responsible.

391
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:49,633
That's not so easy.

392
00:19:50,113 --> 00:19:52,115
Maybe it isn't so hard either.

393
00:19:52,315 --> 00:19:53,756
What do you mean?

394
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:56,789
Another expert has to examine him
before they hang him, right?

395
00:19:56,638 --> 00:19:59,640
A bird named Egelhoffer's doing it.
He'll say the same thing.

396
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,121
- Suppose he does.
- What's your scheme?

397
00:20:02,322 --> 00:20:04,804
You get the interview
with Earl Williams.

398
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:10,007
Print Egelhoffer's statement.
Alongside it, run your interview.

399
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:13,299
Alienist says he's sane.
Interview shows he's goofy.

400
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:16,919
You could save that poor devil's life.
You could...

401
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:20,939
- You're going away.
- How long would the interview take?

402
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,976
An hour for the interview.
An hour to write it.

403
00:20:23,175 --> 00:20:26,338
We could take the 6:00 train
if it'd save a life.

404
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:31,821
No. If you want to save
Earl Williams' life, write it yourself.

405
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:35,183
I can't write this.
It takes a woman's touch.

406
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:37,105
Don't get poetic.
Get Sweeney.

407
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:39,667
He's the best man
for that sob-sister stuff.

408
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:45,109
Duffy just told me his wife finally
had twins. Isn't that terrible?

409
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:49,593
Sweeney went out, and we can't find him.
He has twins, and Williams gets hanged.

410
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:50,915
Now, Walter, look.

411
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:54,677
Argue with her, or you'll have
blood on your hands.

412
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:56,598
How can you be happy after that?

413
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,360
You'll remember that
a man went to the gallows...

414
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,682
...because she was too selfish
to wait two hours.

415
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:06,999
Earl Williams' face will come between
you tonight and the rest of your life.

416
00:21:06,685 --> 00:21:08,886
Stop it, Walter.
The whole place will hear you.

417
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:10,607
What an act.

418
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:14,909
I just remembered Sweeney was only
married four months ago.

419
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:20,214
Hildy, you win. I'm licked.

420
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:23,216
Then Mrs. Sweeney didn't have twins?

421
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:26,098
No, indeed.
The twins were Walter's.

422
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:27,899
It was nothing.

423
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:30,981
Let's forget it.
We'll start over again.

424
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:32,902
- I'll offer a business proposition.
- Not interested.

425
00:21:33,103 --> 00:21:34,343
You'll be interested.

426
00:21:34,624 --> 00:21:36,545
Don't listen to him.
I know him from way back.

427
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:40,507
Excuse me, will you? I'm talking
to him. Now, look, Bruce...

428
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:44,030
...persuade her and you can
write an insurance policy for me.

429
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:47,312
I wouldn't use my wife
for business purposes.

430
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:49,153
Wait a minute, Bruce.

431
00:21:49,313 --> 00:21:52,035
- How big a policy?
- 25,000. 50,000.

432
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:53,757
What's the commission on
a $100,000 policy?

433
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:56,357
- $1000, but...
- What's wrong with $1000?

434
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:58,159
We could use that money.

435
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,880
How long would it take
to get him examined?

436
00:22:00,081 --> 00:22:02,001
I could get a doctor in 20 minutes.

437
00:22:02,202 --> 00:22:04,203
- Get him.
- You keep out of this.

438
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,099
Suppose you have him examined
in his office...

439
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:10,167
...and see what they'll allow
on his carcass.

440
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:13,730
- I'm better than ever.
- That's nothing to brag about.

441
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:17,652
I'll go back and change, and after
you get the check, phone me.

442
00:22:17,852 --> 00:22:20,173
I'll be in the press room
at criminal court.

443
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:23,816
Walter. I think you better
make that a certified check.

444
00:22:24,016 --> 00:22:25,057
Think I'm a crook?

445
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:27,379
Yes. No certified check, no story.

446
00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:28,819
It'll be certified.
Want my fingerprints?

447
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:32,542
- No. I've still got those.
- Gus, how much do I owe you?

448
00:22:33,623 --> 00:22:34,943
Thank you, dear.

449
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,306
- Sorry.
- How much money do you have?

450
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:40,348
Everything we have, $500.

451
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:42,269
- Give it to me.
- But the tickets...

452
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:45,711
I'll buy the tickets.
He'll get you in a crap game.

453
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:47,071
I don't gamble.

454
00:22:47,352 --> 00:22:50,994
I know people that never did anything
till they met Walter.

455
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:53,396
Remember, it's everything we have.

456
00:22:53,596 --> 00:22:54,557
I know.

457
00:22:55,237 --> 00:22:58,119
- You got change of ten?
- See what I mean?

458
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,601
I gave everything to Hildy.
I've got...

459
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:02,643
- Come on.
- Not me. Sign it.

460
00:23:02,803 --> 00:23:04,363
All right.

461
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,525
For the waiter.

462
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:10,007
Come on, Bruce. Really.

463
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:16,319
- I'll open for a dime.
- I'm in.

464
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:19,339
- I'll stay.
- Wilcox 3400.

465
00:23:18,653 --> 00:23:20,094
- How many?
- Two.

466
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:23,376
Take that, one of you birds.
You ain't doing anything, Ernie.

467
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,299
What's the matter with you guys?
Crippled?

468
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:28,740
I'll bet 20 cents.

469
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:30,661
Press room. Wait a minute.

470
00:23:30,861 --> 00:23:34,143
Hello, sarge, McCue talking.
Hold the line, will you? What?

471
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:37,386
This is the press room
of the criminal courts building.

472
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:42,588
New lead on the hanging. This alienist
from New York, Dr. Max J. Egelhoffer.

473
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:46,352
He's interviewing Williams
in the sheriff's office.

474
00:23:46,511 --> 00:23:50,755
Must be the 10th alienist they've had.
If he wasn't crazy, he would be...

475
00:23:50,954 --> 00:23:53,716
...after ten of those babies
psychoanalysed him.

476
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,318
- Is Egelhoffer any good?
- You figure it out.

477
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,800
They sent him to Washington
to interview the Brain Trust.

478
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:01,321
He said they were sane.

479
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:03,043
Here's the situation
before the hanging.

480
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:06,124
I'll pick up a little fudge.
This is Murphy.

481
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:07,365
More on the hanging.

482
00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:11,809
A double guard is around the jail,
municipal buildings, and terminals...

483
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:15,931
...to prepare for the expected uprising
of radicals at the hour of execution.

484
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:20,949
The sheriff's assigned 200 relatives
to guard against the Red Army...

485
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:22,856
...which is leaving Moscow
in a couple minutes.

486
00:24:23,016 --> 00:24:24,857
When the real Red Menace
shows up...

487
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:27,739
...the sheriff will still be
crying wolf. What do you got?

488
00:24:27,939 --> 00:24:29,940
- Is that good?
- Looks good from here.

489
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:32,262
Hildy, when did you get back?

490
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:33,783
- How are you, Eddie?
- Glad to see you.

491
00:24:33,983 --> 00:24:35,704
Where'd you get the hat?

492
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:38,306
- I paid 12 bucks for it.
- Coming back to work?

493
00:24:38,506 --> 00:24:41,668
It's a farewell appearance.
I'm going into business for myself.

494
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:44,150
- What doing?
- I'm getting married tomorrow.

495
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,872
Again? Are we invited to the wedding?

496
00:24:47,032 --> 00:24:49,553
I might use you for a bridesmaid, Roy.

497
00:24:49,634 --> 00:24:52,516
- How are you, Murphy?
- What are you getting married for?

498
00:24:52,715 --> 00:24:54,717
- None of your business.
- You ain't fooling?

499
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:57,039
Fooling? Look what I've got in here.

500
00:24:57,238 --> 00:24:59,641
Three tickets to Albany
on the 6:00 train tonight.

501
00:24:59,921 --> 00:25:00,881
Three?

502
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:04,839
For me and my beau and,
hats off, boys, his sweet darling ma.

503
00:25:04,523 --> 00:25:06,725
- That's nice.
- What kind of marriage is that?

504
00:25:06,925 --> 00:25:10,007
I'm settling down. I'm through
with the newspaper business.

505
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:13,649
Can you picture Hildy singing
lullabies and hanging out didies?

506
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,051
- Swapping lies over the fence?
- Sour grapes.

507
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:19,814
- She'll get tired of beating rugs.
- I'm not going to beat any rugs.

508
00:25:20,294 --> 00:25:23,175
That's Third and Jefferson.
Where the Central School is.

509
00:25:23,376 --> 00:25:25,657
- No school this time of day.
- Why? You quit.

510
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:29,981
- You said you were through.
- I thought it might be a good fire.

511
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:33,263
- What's that?
- Practising for the Williams party.

512
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,745
- You'll miss a nice hanging.
- Not interested.

513
00:25:35,944 --> 00:25:37,665
Tell them to pipe down.

514
00:25:42,188 --> 00:25:46,111
Keep quiet down there! How do you
expect us to get any work done?

515
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,232
Shut up!

516
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:51,035
Little respect
for the press around here.

517
00:25:51,795 --> 00:25:54,277
- Say, did anybody phone me?
- Not that I know of.

518
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,798
Say, does Walter know
you're getting married?

519
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:58,800
- Just had lunch with him.
- He knows you're quitting?

520
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:01,802
- I told him. Any more questions?
- Shall I deal you in?

521
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:04,684
I haven't got time.
I have to do a yarn on Williams.

522
00:26:04,844 --> 00:26:06,765
Did he know what he was doing?

523
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:10,328
If you ask us, no. If you ask the
alienist, the answer's yes.

524
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,249
- What's he do?
- He was a bookkeeper.

525
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:14,370
He starts at $20 a week.
After 14 years...

526
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,051
...he works himself up to $17.50.
- Got more gum?

527
00:26:17,172 --> 00:26:20,334
McClosky Company goes out of
business. Williams loses his job.

528
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:21,575
Can't get another.

529
00:26:22,969 --> 00:26:23,579
I'm in.

530
00:26:23,776 --> 00:26:27,339
So he hangs around the park listening
to soapbox spellbinders...

531
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,621
...making speeches and believes them.
- Makes some of his own.

532
00:26:30,781 --> 00:26:32,629
- Up a dime.
- I'm in.

533
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:37,025
- Anything else, doc?
- No, that'll be all.

534
00:26:37,226 --> 00:26:38,386
Everything okay?

535
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:40,027
Nothing to worry about.

536
00:26:40,228 --> 00:26:42,099
Good, good.

537
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:44,230
- How are you doing, Bruce?
- Just one more thing.

538
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:47,712
- Good day, Mr. Baldwin.
- Goodbye, doc. Thanks very much.

539
00:26:47,912 --> 00:26:49,914
Who's the beneficiary?

540
00:26:50,114 --> 00:26:52,996
- Excuse me?
- That is, in case of your death.

541
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:55,958
- Who do we pay the money to?
- Why, Hildy, of course.

542
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:59,040
I don't know. That'd make me
feel pretty funny.

543
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,799
Now, why shouldn't I make
Hildy my whatever-it-was?

544
00:27:02,602 --> 00:27:04,323
I should take care of her.

545
00:27:04,524 --> 00:27:06,805
But you will take care of her, Bruce.

546
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,687
If that doctor's right,
I'm good for a long time yet.

547
00:27:09,887 --> 00:27:12,969
Look, Bruce, this is
a debt of honour with me.

548
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,651
I was a bad husband to Hildy.

549
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:19,133
She could have claimed a lot of
alimony. But she wouldn't take any.

550
00:27:19,293 --> 00:27:21,215
She was too independent.

551
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:24,579
- I'm independent too, you know.
- I know you are.

552
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,698
But look, you just figure it this way.

553
00:27:26,898 --> 00:27:31,019
I'm good for, we'll say,
at least 25 years yet.

554
00:27:30,741 --> 00:27:34,503
By then, you'll have made enough so
that money won't mean anything to you.

555
00:27:34,664 --> 00:27:36,505
But suppose you haven't made good.

556
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:39,387
What about Hildy's old age?
Think of Hildy.

557
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:41,508
I can see her now.

558
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:44,751
White-haired, lavender and old lace.

559
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,139
- Can't you see her, Bruce?
- Yes, yes, I can.

560
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:49,674
She's old, isn't she?

561
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:54,357
Don't you think that Hildy's entitled
to spend her remaining years...

562
00:27:54,557 --> 00:27:57,639
...without worries of money?
Of course you do, Bruce.

563
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,560
Of course, if you put it that way.

564
00:28:00,321 --> 00:28:03,203
And remember, I love her too.

565
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:06,285
Yes, I'm beginning to realize that.

566
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:08,286
And the beauty of it is...

567
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:11,569
...she'll never have to know
until I've passed on.

568
00:28:11,768 --> 00:28:14,650
Maybe she'll think kindly of me...

569
00:28:14,931 --> 00:28:16,651
...after I'm gone.

570
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,740
You make me feel like a heel,
coming between you.

571
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,502
No, no, Bruce.
You didn't come between us.

572
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:35,184
It was over for her before
you came. For me...

573
00:28:36,825 --> 00:28:40,788
...it'll never be. What do you want?
- Can I see you a minute, please?

574
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:43,349
Excuse me, Bruce.

575
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,071
Did you get it, you get it?

576
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:47,592
Where is it? Come on.

577
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:51,234
- Certified?
- Sure. But, Walter, that's for $2500.

578
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:57,199
- Here we are, certified and everything.
- Certified.

579
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,202
I'm afraid Hildy'll feel ashamed
to think she hasn't trusted you.

580
00:29:03,229 --> 00:29:03,839
She'll know some day.

581
00:29:03,723 --> 00:29:07,205
You promised to phone her
as soon as you got the check.

582
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:08,807
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

583
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:12,009
Get me Hildy Johnson, press room,
criminal courts building.

584
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:15,171
Sit down, Bruce.
The operator will get her for you.

585
00:29:17,329 --> 00:29:18,133
Excuse me, will you?

586
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:21,134
Yes, I'll wait, thank you.

587
00:29:23,537 --> 00:29:26,018
Start hollering. Hildegarde.

588
00:29:26,218 --> 00:29:27,659
Thank you.

589
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:29,301
Hildy Johnson speaking.

590
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:34,383
Take it easy, will you?

591
00:29:36,585 --> 00:29:38,506
Did you get the check?
Is it certified?

592
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:41,589
Certified and everything.
I have it right in my pocket.

593
00:29:42,068 --> 00:29:43,589
In your pocket. That's fine.

594
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,112
Wait. Maybe it isn't so fine.
Where are you?

595
00:29:46,272 --> 00:29:47,353
Mr. Burns' office.

596
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,593
Is he there?

597
00:29:49,353 --> 00:29:53,316
Look, Bruce. I don't want you to
carry that check in your pocket.

598
00:29:53,397 --> 00:29:54,757
Well, because...

599
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:57,919
Yes, yes, I know all that.
But...

600
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,321
There's an old
newspaper superstition...

601
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:04,239
...your first big check you
put in the lining of your hat.

602
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:09,047
- In your hat. It brings good luck.
- I never heard that before.

603
00:30:09,247 --> 00:30:12,529
Neither did I. I know it
sounds silly, dear, but do it for me.

604
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:13,850
Yes, yes, right now.

605
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,051
All right. Just a minute.

606
00:30:24,897 --> 00:30:26,258
There, I've done it.

607
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:27,779
Anything else?

608
00:30:29,009 --> 00:30:29,900
Oh, yes.

609
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:31,062
All right.

610
00:30:33,543 --> 00:30:35,585
Yes, I'll tell him. Goodbye.

611
00:30:36,145 --> 00:30:39,227
- Everything all right?
- Hildy said she'll get to work.

612
00:30:39,307 --> 00:30:40,868
- Fine.
- I must be going now.

613
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:43,750
You don't want to forget this.
It might rain, you know.

614
00:30:44,871 --> 00:30:47,873
You mind if I don't show you out?
I'm so busy in here.

615
00:30:48,072 --> 00:30:49,114
Thanks for everything.

616
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:51,114
- Excuse me?
- Thanks for everything.

617
00:30:51,315 --> 00:30:54,117
Nonsense. Don't thank me.
I should thank you.

618
00:30:54,317 --> 00:30:55,758
- So long.
- So long.

619
00:31:08,606 --> 00:31:09,967
Hello, Cooley.

620
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:11,969
What are you doing here?

621
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:14,011
I want an interview with Williams.

622
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,251
- No interviews.
- Why?

623
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,813
Sheriff's orders. Besides, a doctor's
coming over. Can't do it.

624
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:20,334
Say, is this your money?

625
00:31:20,535 --> 00:31:21,855
- No.
- 20 bucks?

626
00:31:22,056 --> 00:31:23,616
- Yeah.
- That's what I thought.

627
00:31:23,776 --> 00:31:25,058
Come on, I'm in a hurry.

628
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:26,579
Open up here.

629
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:28,780
- Now, Hildy, don't be...
- I won't be long.

630
00:31:33,783 --> 00:31:35,504
- Hello, Earl.
- Hello.

631
00:31:35,705 --> 00:31:38,306
I'm Johnson.
Mind if I talk to you for a bit?

632
00:31:38,506 --> 00:31:40,587
No, I haven't anything else to do.

633
00:31:40,788 --> 00:31:42,349
I guess that's right.

634
00:31:45,872 --> 00:31:49,233
So I couldn't plead insanity.
I'm just as sane as anybody else.

635
00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:53,757
- You didn't mean to kill the policeman.
- It's against everything I stand for.

636
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:56,639
They know it was an accident.
I'm not guilty.

637
00:31:56,838 --> 00:31:58,680
It's just the world.

638
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,562
I see what you mean.

639
00:32:01,722 --> 00:32:05,899
Sorry about the lipstick, Earl.
Now, look, after you lost your job...

640
00:32:05,565 --> 00:32:06,525
...what did you do?

641
00:32:06,845 --> 00:32:08,286
I tried to find another job.

642
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:10,207
How did you spend your time?

643
00:32:10,288 --> 00:32:14,050
I used to sit around in the park,
anyplace. I don't smoke.

644
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:17,092
When you were in the park,
did you hear any speeches?

645
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:19,614
You mean those fellows
that talk too much?

646
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:21,816
I didn't pay any attention...

647
00:32:22,015 --> 00:32:24,977
- Did you hear anything they said?
- Yes.

648
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,659
Is there anything in particular
you remember?

649
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:29,981
- There was one.
- What did he talk about?

650
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,303
He talked about production for use.

651
00:32:32,382 --> 00:32:33,543
Production for use?

652
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,706
Yes, he said everything
should be made use of.

653
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:38,067
Makes sense, doesn't it?

654
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:41,028
Yes, I liked him.
He was a good speaker.

655
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:43,230
When you found yourself
with that gun...

656
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:46,392
...and that policeman coming at you,
what did you think?

657
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:48,153
I don't know exactly.

658
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:50,635
Could it have been
"production for use"?

659
00:32:50,915 --> 00:32:54,277
- I don't know. I...
- What's a gun for, Earl?

660
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:55,518
A gun?

661
00:32:55,718 --> 00:32:57,559
Why, to shoot, of course.

662
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,321
Maybe that's why you used it.

663
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:01,962
- Maybe.
- It seems reasonable.

664
00:33:02,162 --> 00:33:04,083
Yes, yes, it is.

665
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:06,565
I've never had a gun in my hand before.

666
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:08,807
And that's what a gun's for, isn't it?

667
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:10,528
- Maybe that's why...
- Sure, it is.

668
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:15,131
That's what I thought of. " Production
for use." It's simple, isn't it?

669
00:33:15,331 --> 00:33:17,612
- Very simple.
- There's nothing crazy about that.

670
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:20,559
- Nothing at all.
- Write about that in your paper.

671
00:33:20,614 --> 00:33:22,896
You bet I will.
Who sent you the roses?

672
00:33:23,096 --> 00:33:24,737
Miss Mollie Malloy.
She's wonderful...

673
00:33:24,938 --> 00:33:25,978
Is that her picture?

674
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:28,980
- Yes. She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Time's up, Hildy.

675
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,101
All right.

676
00:33:31,262 --> 00:33:32,629
Guess that's all.

677
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:35,865
I liked talking to you.
Goodbye, Miss Johnson.

678
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:38,266
Goodbye, Earl.

679
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:40,187
Good luck.

680
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,391
- Three landladies, boys.
- Did well, didn't you?

681
00:33:45,671 --> 00:33:47,393
<i>What will the Post do without Hildy?</i>

682
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,634
You suppose Burns
will ever let her go?

683
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,116
Remember when Fenton
wanted to go to Hollywood?

684
00:33:52,396 --> 00:33:54,597
- Had him thrown in jail for arson.
- Forgery.

685
00:33:54,717 --> 00:33:56,718
- Was that it?
- Yeah, give me some change.

686
00:33:56,998 --> 00:33:59,721
Hey, Mac.
Hey, Stairway Sam.

687
00:34:01,229 --> 00:34:04,204
Would you mind turning on some lights?
It's so dark, you can't see.

688
00:34:04,524 --> 00:34:07,767
- Who's this guy Hildy's marrying?
- I don't know. Bruce something.

689
00:34:07,966 --> 00:34:09,968
- I give the marriage six months.
- Why?

690
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:12,210
She can't stay away from the paper.

691
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,610
Did you see her
when that bell went off?

692
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:18,940
It must be pretty nice to be able
to walk out of a place and quit.

693
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:21,896
I had a publicity job offer last year.
I should have taken it.

694
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:24,017
I'd like that,
a job on the side.

695
00:34:24,218 --> 00:34:27,740
A desk and a stenographer.
I wouldn't mind a nice, big blond.

696
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,021
With big brown eyes.

697
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:31,983
I'll bet you ten to one it don't last
six months.

698
00:34:32,184 --> 00:34:35,650
She's like us, or we wouldn't be
waiting for that guy to dance.

699
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:38,628
- Miss Mollie Malloy.
- Hello, Mollie. How's tricks?

700
00:34:38,788 --> 00:34:42,951
- I've been looking for you tramps.
- Come to pay a call on Williams?

701
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,593
Nice roses you sent Earl. What do you
want done with them tomorrow?

702
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,114
A lot of wise guys.

703
00:34:48,394 --> 00:34:50,235
You're interrupting.
What do you want?

704
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,556
I came to...

705
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:54,959
I came to tell you
what I think of you.

706
00:34:55,117 --> 00:34:57,190
Keep your shirt on.

707
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,360
If you was worth breaking my nails,
I'd tear you open.

708
00:34:59,561 --> 00:35:03,800
What are you sore about?
That was a swell story we gave you.

709
00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:07,269
You've been making
a fool out of me long enough.

710
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:10,008
I never said I loved Earl and wanted
to marry him on the gallows.

711
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:11,289
You made that up.

712
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,331
And my being his soul mate and
having a love nest with him.

713
00:35:14,532 --> 00:35:17,333
You've been around him
since he got in the death house.

714
00:35:17,613 --> 00:35:20,296
- That's a lie.
- Everybody knows you're his girlfriend.

715
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:22,817
I met Mr. Williams
just once in my life.

716
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:25,699
When he was in the rain
without his coat on...

717
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:28,099
...like a sick dog,
before the shooting.

718
00:35:28,181 --> 00:35:31,262
- Give me one.
- I went up like any human would...

719
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,184
...and asked him what was wrong.

720
00:35:33,384 --> 00:35:36,746
He told me about being fired after
being on the job for 14 years.

721
00:35:36,827 --> 00:35:39,079
- Who bets?
- Bet 20 cents.

722
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:40,949
I brought him to my room
because it was warm.

723
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,871
Put it on a phonograph.

724
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,791
Listen to me, please.

725
00:35:45,672 --> 00:35:49,115
I tell you he just sat there
talking to me all night.

726
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:51,760
He never once laid a hand on me.

727
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:53,637
And in the morning he went away...

728
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:56,318
...and I never saw him again
till the trial.

729
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,201
- Sure, I was his witness.
- What a witness.

730
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,043
That's why you persecute me.

731
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,204
Because Earl treated me decent,
and not like an animal.

732
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,686
- We're busy.
- Go see your boyfriend.

733
00:36:07,007 --> 00:36:09,008
- He's got a nice room.
- Not for long.

734
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,729
He left a call for 7 a.m.

735
00:36:10,929 --> 00:36:15,172
It's a wonder lightning don't
come down and strike you all dead.

736
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:26,219
What's that?

737
00:36:26,378 --> 00:36:29,581
They're fixing up a pain in the neck
for your boyfriend.

738
00:36:29,942 --> 00:36:31,103
Shame on you.

739
00:36:31,383 --> 00:36:32,744
Shame on you!

740
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,786
A poor little fellow that never
meant nobody no harm.

741
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,827
Sitting with the Angel of Death,
and you cracking jokes.

742
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:43,030
- You're gonna get out of here.
- Take your hands off me!

743
00:36:43,191 --> 00:36:45,730
- Let's get out of here.
- They ain't human.

744
00:36:45,592 --> 00:36:48,193
- They're newspapermen.
- All they've done is lie.

745
00:36:48,394 --> 00:36:50,235
All they're doing is writing lies.

746
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:52,157
Why won't they listen to me?

747
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:54,838
Why won't they listen to me?

748
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:15,092
Who? Hildy Johnson?

749
00:37:15,572 --> 00:37:18,374
Hang on. She'll be back in a minute.

750
00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:23,376
You guys want to play any more cards?

751
00:37:23,537 --> 00:37:26,619
What's the use? I can't win anyway.

752
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,872
Gentlemen of the press.

753
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,273
Hildy.

754
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:49,795
Phone for you.

755
00:37:54,878 --> 00:37:57,360
What?
Where are you?

756
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,081
You're where?

757
00:37:59,681 --> 00:38:01,322
Well, how did that happen?

758
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:04,285
Never mind, never mind.
I'll be right down.

759
00:38:06,006 --> 00:38:07,646
I'm sorry, Pete. Sorry.

760
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,249
Hi, sheriff. How you doing?

761
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:13,971
My shin and my back.
What's going on around here?

762
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,853
- Bruce was in trouble.
- Lioness rushes to defend cub.

763
00:38:16,972 --> 00:38:19,095
Man forgets hankie.
Mama goes to wipe nose.

764
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,096
I still give the marriage
six months.

765
00:38:21,177 --> 00:38:23,579
I don't know what
you're talking about.

766
00:38:23,577 --> 00:38:25,219
What do you want, Pete?

767
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:28,300
Oh, I got the tickets for
the hanging here, boys.

768
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:29,662
- Pete?
- What?

769
00:38:29,942 --> 00:38:33,503
Why can't you hang this guy
at 5:00 instead of 7?

770
00:38:33,664 --> 00:38:37,070
It won't hurt you, and
we can make the city edition.

771
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:40,509
That's kind of raw, Roy, hanging a man
in his sleep to please a newspaper.

772
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:43,951
But you can reprieve him so he
hangs three days before election.

773
00:38:44,151 --> 00:38:46,273
You can run on a
law-and-order ticket.

774
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,035
I had nothing
to do with those reprieves.

775
00:38:49,235 --> 00:38:51,276
How do we know there won't
be another?

776
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,356
What if Egelhoffer
finds him insane?

777
00:38:53,557 --> 00:38:57,039
He won't find him insane, because
he isn't. He's just as sane as I am.

778
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,561
Saner!

779
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,242
Be serious, boys.
After all, this is a hanging.

780
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:03,284
It's gonna go
according to schedule.

781
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,766
Seven o'clock in the morning
and not earlier.

782
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:08,168
There's such a thing as being humane.

783
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,369
Okay, Pinky.
Wait till you want a favour.

784
00:39:10,568 --> 00:39:12,570
- And please don't call me Pinky.
- Why?

785
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:15,572
Because I got a name, see,
and it's Peter B. Hartwell.

786
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,293
- What's the B for?
- Bull.

787
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:21,135
I'm innocent. I didn't do it.
I never stole a watch in my life!

788
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,538
I know you didn't.
Mike, let him out.

789
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,700
I can't. He's accused of stealing
a watch they found on him.

790
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,621
- But I never stole...
- Please.

791
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,541
Diamond Louie, a crook, accused him.

792
00:39:30,742 --> 00:39:33,639
- I know. It's no good.
- You gonna let him out or not?

793
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:34,985
- I never stole...
- Please.

794
00:39:35,144 --> 00:39:37,666
<i>All right, you're not.
Read the Post tomorrow.</i>

795
00:39:37,867 --> 00:39:40,268
I can't imagine who'd do that to me.

796
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,231
- I can't think of an enemy.
- I'm sure you haven't any...

797
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,313
- Have you got the check?
- Yes, I have it right here.

798
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:49,394
That's a funny superstition
you newspaper people have.

799
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:51,195
Yes, isn't it?

800
00:39:51,396 --> 00:39:53,117
About being arrested, I thought...

801
00:39:53,317 --> 00:39:56,000
...Walter Burns might have
something to do with it.

802
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:58,320
But then I realized he couldn't have.

803
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,722
- Why?
- He's a very nice fellow.

804
00:40:01,003 --> 00:40:02,722
Oh, yes, I found that out.

805
00:40:02,923 --> 00:40:05,605
- What's the matter?
- I've lost my wallet.

806
00:40:05,806 --> 00:40:09,200
Yes? Well, Bruce, never mind.
I have the money.

807
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:11,769
- Better give me the check.
- And that picture of us in Bermuda.

808
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,012
Don't bother, Bruce.
You'll find lots of things missing.

809
00:40:17,613 --> 00:40:20,135
Wait here.
I'm not taking any more chances.

810
00:40:20,296 --> 00:40:24,980
I'll be down in three minutes.
We'll take the next train. Sorry.

811
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:27,019
"And so into this
little tortured mind...

812
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,302
...came the idea that that gun
had been produced for use.

813
00:40:30,382 --> 00:40:31,824
And use it he did.

814
00:40:32,144 --> 00:40:35,786
But the state has a production-
for-use plan too. It has a gallows.

815
00:40:35,985 --> 00:40:39,508
And at 7 a.m., unless a miracle occurs,
that gallows will be used...

816
00:40:39,709 --> 00:40:42,510
...to separate the soul
of Earl Williams from his body.

817
00:40:42,711 --> 00:40:44,632
And out of Mollie Malloy's life...

818
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:47,514
...will go the one kindly
soul she ever knew."

819
00:40:48,273 --> 00:40:51,160
That's as far as she got.

820
00:40:50,675 --> 00:40:54,119
- Can that girl write an interview?
- She'll do till somebody comes along.

821
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,519
It's not ethical,
reading other people's stuff.

822
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,282
Where do you get that ethics stuff?
You're the only one who'll swipe it.

823
00:41:00,363 --> 00:41:04,125
I say anybody that can write like that
won't give it up to sew socks...

824
00:41:04,204 --> 00:41:05,766
...for a guy in insurance.

825
00:41:05,846 --> 00:41:08,648
Now I give that marriage 3 months,
and I'm laying 3-to-1.

826
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:10,568
- Any takers?
- I'll take that bet.

827
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:14,090
A girl can't leave the room without
being discussed by old ladies.

828
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:16,972
<i>Hello, Post? Get me Walter Burns,
will you, please?</i>

829
00:41:17,293 --> 00:41:21,297
Don't get sore. We were only saying a
reporter like you wouldn't quit easy.

830
00:41:21,615 --> 00:41:25,139
This is Hildy Johnson. I can quit
all right, without a single quiver.

831
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:27,860
I'll live like a human,
not like you chumps.

832
00:41:28,021 --> 00:41:30,342
Is that you?
I've got some news for you.

833
00:41:30,543 --> 00:41:33,624
I got the interview, but I've got
some more important news.

834
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:35,706
Better get a pencil
and take it down.

835
00:41:35,905 --> 00:41:37,267
All ready?

836
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,869
Get this, you double-crossing
chimpanzee.

837
00:41:40,028 --> 00:41:42,070
There won't be an interview
or a story.

838
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:44,352
Your check leaves with me
in 20 minutes.

839
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,753
I wouldn't cover
the burning of Rome for you.

840
00:41:47,074 --> 00:41:48,994
If I ever lay my eyes
on you again...

841
00:41:49,155 --> 00:41:52,356
...I'll hammer your skull
so it rings like a Chinese gong!

842
00:41:52,517 --> 00:41:55,880
You don't know why I'm angry?
Have Louie tell you about his watch.

843
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,280
And there's just one other
little thing.

844
00:42:01,364 --> 00:42:03,885
Hear that?
That's the story I just wrote.

845
00:42:04,045 --> 00:42:06,367
I know we had a bargain.
I just said I'd write it.

846
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:09,648
I didn't say I wouldn't tear it up.
It's all in pieces now.

847
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:11,930
I hope to do the same
for you someday.

848
00:42:12,131 --> 00:42:14,131
That's my farewell
to the newspaper game.

849
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,052
I'll be a woman,
not a news machine.

850
00:42:16,253 --> 00:42:19,894
I'll have babies, give them cod-liver
oil and watch their teeth grow.

851
00:42:20,096 --> 00:42:22,977
If I see one of them
look at a paper, I'll brain him.

852
00:42:23,177 --> 00:42:24,338
Where's my hat?

853
00:42:25,979 --> 00:42:29,222
- Mr. Burns? Yes, she's still here.
- Give me that.

854
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:32,983
And another thing I want...

855
00:42:33,744 --> 00:42:36,067
Where is my...?
There it is.

856
00:42:36,227 --> 00:42:38,827
- Doctor. Sorry to be late.
- Quite all right.

857
00:42:39,028 --> 00:42:41,230
These boys from the papers
take up my time.

858
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,631
They want me to hang Williams
at their convenience.

859
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:45,753
- Oh, hello, Earl.
- These newspapers.

860
00:42:45,952 --> 00:42:47,753
What they did to me in Chicago!

861
00:42:47,954 --> 00:42:49,596
- Always want interviews.
- Me too.

862
00:42:49,876 --> 00:42:51,997
I did promise to make
some statement...

863
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:53,999
...when I finished.
You don't mind?

864
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:57,000
It's hardly ethical.
All statements come from me.

865
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,561
I see. What do you say to giving
them some sort of joint interview?

866
00:43:00,843 --> 00:43:03,525
I'll discuss the psychological
aspects and you...

867
00:43:03,805 --> 00:43:05,365
We'd have a picture together?

868
00:43:05,526 --> 00:43:07,166
- Shaking hands.
- Splendid idea!

869
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:10,809
- I don't take a good picture.
- That doesn't matter. Publicity does.

870
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:13,331
Doctor, I'm getting awful tired.

871
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,331
Can't I go back to jail again?

872
00:43:15,612 --> 00:43:18,974
Sorry. I forgot you were there.
We've some further questions for you.

873
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:21,376
Sheriff, would you extinguish
the lights?

874
00:43:21,577 --> 00:43:26,180
That will help with what we're
doing here. Now, let me see.

875
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,143
Mr. Williams, you know
that you're going to be executed.

876
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:33,025
Who do you feel
is responsible for that?

877
00:43:33,104 --> 00:43:35,786
I am innocent. It wasn't my fault.

878
00:43:35,985 --> 00:43:37,626
- Well, Murph.
- Send us a post card.

879
00:43:37,827 --> 00:43:39,347
<i>- Bye.
- Au revoir, Hildegarde.</i>

880
00:43:39,548 --> 00:43:41,869
- When will we see you?
- Next time you see me...

881
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,751
...I'll be in a Rolls-Royce,
giving interviews on success.

882
00:43:44,912 --> 00:43:46,273
So long, you wage slaves.

883
00:43:46,552 --> 00:43:49,914
When you're climbing fire escapes,
getting kicked out front doors...

884
00:43:50,035 --> 00:43:53,758
...and eating in one-armed joints,
don't forget your pal, Hildy Johnson.

885
00:43:53,878 --> 00:43:57,039
And when the road beyond unfolds,
and the...

886
00:44:03,284 --> 00:44:04,805
Look out! It's a jailbreak!

887
00:44:08,168 --> 00:44:10,568
What's the matter? What happened?

888
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:13,371
Watch where you're aiming,
will you?

889
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:16,532
- Watch the gate! He'll try the gate!
- Who was it?

890
00:44:16,733 --> 00:44:18,375
- Earl Williams!
- Who did he say?

891
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:19,615
Earl Williams!

892
00:44:21,056 --> 00:44:23,177
Hello! Hurry up, this is important.

893
00:44:23,738 --> 00:44:25,660
- Earl Williams just escaped.
- Jailbreak!

894
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:29,782
- Williams went over the wall!
- I don't know anything yet.

895
00:44:34,704 --> 00:44:37,947
<i>Hello, Post? Give me Walter Burns,
quick. Hildy Johnson.</i>

896
00:44:38,628 --> 00:44:40,068
Walter? Walter? Hildy.

897
00:44:40,269 --> 00:44:43,030
Earl Williams just escaped
from the county jail.

898
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:45,552
Don't worry, I'm on the job.

899
00:44:59,282 --> 00:45:01,963
Hey, Cooley!
Wait!

900
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:07,727
Hey, wait a minute!

901
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,021
Cooley, I want to talk to you!

902
00:45:37,307 --> 00:45:39,148
This is Endicott. Give me rewrite.

903
00:45:39,709 --> 00:45:41,070
He ain't here.

904
00:45:41,269 --> 00:45:43,271
Hello, Gil?
Here's the situation now.

905
00:45:43,391 --> 00:45:45,672
Ready? Williams was taken to
the sheriff's...

906
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:49,514
...to be examined by Egelhoffer.
In a few minutes, he shot his way out.

907
00:45:49,715 --> 00:45:53,557
Nobody knows where he got the gun.
He got out through the skylight.

908
00:45:53,758 --> 00:45:57,681
He must have slid down the rainpipe.
No, nobody knows where he got it.

909
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,760
Give me the desk.

910
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:01,322
The crime commission offers
a $10,000 reward.

911
00:46:01,523 --> 00:46:03,845
No clue yet as to
Williams' whereabouts.

912
00:46:04,045 --> 00:46:06,606
Here's a feature.
An accident about a tear bomb.

913
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:08,927
Yeah, tear bomb.
Criminals cry for it.

914
00:46:09,128 --> 00:46:10,088
I don't know.

915
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:13,731
The tear bomb went off
in the hands of the bombing squad.

916
00:46:14,012 --> 00:46:15,932
These deputies
went to the hospital.

917
00:46:16,052 --> 00:46:19,695
- A fine friend you are.
- Wilkerson, the mayor's brother-in-law.

918
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:23,579
- After all I've done for you.
- Howard Schuster, the sheriff's uncle.

919
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:25,739
Highlights on Sheriff
Hartwell's manhunt.

920
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,541
William Mansfield, his landlord,
and Lester Winthrop...

921
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:32,184
...who married the sheriff's niece.
The very homely dame. Call you back.

922
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:35,827
Mrs. William Rice, scrub lady,
while scrubbing the eighth floor...

923
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:37,548
...was shot by a deputy.

924
00:46:37,747 --> 00:46:40,829
- Look, I'm not...
- There goes another scrub lady!

925
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:43,231
It was a flesh wound.
She's in the hospital.

926
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,193
- McCue speaking. Get the desk.
- Any dope on how he escaped?

927
00:46:46,393 --> 00:46:48,875
The sheriff let him out
so he could vote for him.

928
00:46:49,076 --> 00:46:51,956
A man looking like
Earl Williams boarded a southbound...

929
00:46:52,157 --> 00:46:53,677
Call you back.

930
00:46:53,878 --> 00:46:57,200
- I thought you'd gone.
- I thought so too.

931
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,220
Get me Walter Burns, quick!

932
00:47:01,282 --> 00:47:03,124
Walter, listen.

933
00:47:03,285 --> 00:47:06,567
I've got the story on Williams'
escape, and it's exclusive.

934
00:47:06,767 --> 00:47:08,968
That's right, and it's a pip.

935
00:47:09,168 --> 00:47:11,650
It cost me $450
to tear it out of Cooley.

936
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:13,010
What's the story?

937
00:47:13,211 --> 00:47:16,930
I'll give it to you. First I have
to tell you I gave him money.

938
00:47:16,653 --> 00:47:17,693
And it wasn't mine.

939
00:47:17,814 --> 00:47:19,934
It's Bruce's money,
and I want it back.

940
00:47:20,776 --> 00:47:22,016
Bruce's money?

941
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:24,619
Sure, you'll get it.
Now, what's the story?

942
00:47:24,818 --> 00:47:27,500
I'll send the money.
I swear it on my mother's grave.

943
00:47:27,701 --> 00:47:30,663
Here's the...
Wait a minute, your mother's alive!

944
00:47:30,863 --> 00:47:33,264
My grandmother's grave.
What's the story?

945
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,186
You get that money down here.

946
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:39,079
All right, here's your story.
The jailbreak of your dreams.

947
00:47:38,748 --> 00:47:40,950
Dr. Egelhoffer,
the thinker from New York...

948
00:47:41,148 --> 00:47:44,030
...was giving Williams a sanity
test in the sheriff's office.

949
00:47:44,311 --> 00:47:47,394
Sticking a lot of pins in him
so he could get his reflexes.

950
00:47:47,594 --> 00:47:50,356
He decided to reenact the crime
as it had taken place...

951
00:47:50,556 --> 00:47:53,077
...in order to study
Williams' coordination.

952
00:47:53,238 --> 00:47:56,800
I'm coming to it. He had to have a gun
to reenact the crime.

953
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:00,561
Who do you suppose supplied it?
Peter B. Hartwell. B for brains.

954
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,204
No kidding!

955
00:48:04,766 --> 00:48:06,807
I'm not good enough
to make this one up.

956
00:48:07,007 --> 00:48:09,208
The sheriff gave his gun
to the professor...

957
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:12,851
...who gave it to Earl, who shot
the professor in the classified ads.

958
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:15,920
No, ads.
Ain't it perfect?

959
00:48:15,733 --> 00:48:19,575
If he'd unrolled a red carpet
it couldn't have been more ideal.

960
00:48:19,776 --> 00:48:21,896
Who? Oh, no.
Egelhoffer wasn't badly hurt.

961
00:48:21,977 --> 00:48:24,858
He's in the hospital,
where they're afraid he'll recover.

962
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:26,380
That's great work, Hildy.

963
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:29,581
Don't worry about the money.
You'll get it in 15 minutes.

964
00:48:29,742 --> 00:48:33,585
I'd better. Bruce is waiting
in a taxi for me, and we're in a hurry.

965
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:34,744
Hold on a minute.

966
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,385
Vangie, come here.

967
00:48:36,586 --> 00:48:39,949
There's a guy in a taxi in front of
criminal courts. Bruce Baldwin.

968
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,592
- What does he look like?
- That guy in the movies, Ralph Bellamy.

969
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:45,233
- Oh, him?
- Can you handle it?

970
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,233
I've never flopped
on you yet, have I?

971
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,235
Get going. You only got
about two minutes. Hurry.

972
00:48:50,396 --> 00:48:52,797
Sorry to keep you waiting.
How much was it again?

973
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:55,679
$450. Well, just a second.

974
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,161
Louie, come here. I need $450
worth of counterfeit money.

975
00:48:59,362 --> 00:49:02,523
- Can't carry that much, boss.
- No, just the $450 counterfeit.

976
00:49:02,724 --> 00:49:03,684
I got that on me.

977
00:49:03,845 --> 00:49:05,767
Quite a coincidence.
Take it to Hildy.

978
00:49:05,965 --> 00:49:07,887
It's coming.
I'm sending it with Louie.

979
00:49:08,088 --> 00:49:10,689
Thanks for your story.
Good luck on your honeymoon.

980
00:49:10,889 --> 00:49:14,052
No, no, never mind the thanks.
Just see that money gets here.

981
00:49:16,932 --> 00:49:19,615
- Hildy, you still here?
- No, I'm in Niagara Falls.

982
00:49:19,816 --> 00:49:21,056
McCue speaking.

983
00:49:21,257 --> 00:49:23,980
Emil, I got a good feature
on the manhunt.

984
00:49:23,738 --> 00:49:27,581
Ready? Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe, coloured,
gave birth to a pickaninny...

985
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,343
...in a patrol wagon, with Hartwell's
rifle squad acting as nurses.

986
00:49:31,543 --> 00:49:34,905
Phoebe was walking along
the street when... That's right.

987
00:49:35,066 --> 00:49:37,588
So they coaxed her
into the patrol wagon.

988
00:49:37,788 --> 00:49:40,189
When the pickaninny was born,
they checked...

989
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:43,720
...to see if it was Williams.
They know he's hiding somewhere.

990
00:49:44,032 --> 00:49:47,273
Here's the payoff. They named the kid
Peter Hartwell DeWolfe.

991
00:49:47,554 --> 00:49:49,316
Press room.

992
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,876
Bruce? I thought you were
downstairs in a...

993
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,317
What?

994
00:49:53,518 --> 00:49:55,639
Arrested again? What for this time?

995
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,882
Well, they called it "mashing."

996
00:50:00,523 --> 00:50:02,764
No, I didn't, Hildy!

997
00:50:03,244 --> 00:50:05,727
I was sitting in the taxi
where you left me...

998
00:50:05,925 --> 00:50:10,128
...and the young lady seemed
to have a dizzy spell and I just...

999
00:50:12,731 --> 00:50:14,652
She's kind of...

1000
00:50:17,253 --> 00:50:18,974
Yes, she's a blond.

1001
00:50:19,096 --> 00:50:20,559
Yes, very blond.

1002
00:50:20,695 --> 00:50:22,817
I know how it happened.
Just a minute.

1003
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:25,818
Get me Walter Burns. Hildy Johnson.

1004
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,543
Bruce, where are you? 27th Precinct?
Hold on a minute.

1005
00:50:29,742 --> 00:50:32,030
Walter, you...

1006
00:50:31,664 --> 00:50:33,184
He was there a minute ago.

1007
00:50:33,384 --> 00:50:34,744
But I want...

1008
00:50:34,945 --> 00:50:38,108
"I'm sorry, I can't locate him."
Why, that double-crossing...

1009
00:50:38,188 --> 00:50:41,190
Hello, not you.
Bruce, I can't get there right away.

1010
00:50:41,349 --> 00:50:42,710
How about 20 minutes?

1011
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:44,720
I have to wait here for the...

1012
00:50:44,632 --> 00:50:46,153
I'll tell you when I see you.

1013
00:50:46,353 --> 00:50:48,195
If I ever get my hands
on Walter...

1014
00:50:48,394 --> 00:50:50,876
- Anything I can do?
- How much money you got?

1015
00:50:51,077 --> 00:50:52,396
- $1.80.
- 64 cents.

1016
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:55,119
- Welcome to it.
- Thanks, you better buy an annuity.

1017
00:50:55,398 --> 00:50:58,641
What's that, Emil? No, I can't
give you an official statement.

1018
00:50:58,961 --> 00:51:02,124
Wait a minute. Here's the mayor.
How about a statement, mayor?

1019
00:51:02,202 --> 00:51:05,367
- Don't pester me now, please.
- His Honour won't say anything.

1020
00:51:05,566 --> 00:51:08,099
- You seen Hartwell?
- Hard to tell.

1021
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,329
There's so many
cockroaches around...

1022
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:11,329
Wait. How about a statement?

1023
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:14,972
- We go to press in 20 minutes.
- I've nothing to say. Not now.

1024
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:17,375
What do you know
about the escape?

1025
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:20,360
- Where'd he get the gun?
- Not so fast.

1026
00:51:19,695 --> 00:51:22,097
- About the election...
- What effect will this have on voters?

1027
00:51:22,297 --> 00:51:23,617
None whatsoever.

1028
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:26,220
How can an unavoidable
misfortune like this...

1029
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:29,782
...have any influence on the upright
citizens of our fair city?

1030
00:51:29,981 --> 00:51:32,744
Mr. Mayor, please, is there
a Red Menace or ain't there?

1031
00:51:32,945 --> 00:51:34,585
How did Williams get out?

1032
00:51:34,786 --> 00:51:37,067
Have you picked out somebody
to be responsible?

1033
00:51:37,267 --> 00:51:39,789
Is it true that you're
on Stalin's payroll?

1034
00:51:39,949 --> 00:51:42,351
The senator claims you
sleep in red underwear.

1035
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:45,152
Forget the jokes.
Don't forget I'm the mayor and...

1036
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:46,874
Hartwell, I want to see you!

1037
00:51:47,074 --> 00:51:49,555
- How'd he get away?
- Where'd he get the gun?

1038
00:51:49,756 --> 00:51:51,956
Any statement on the
Red Uprising tomorrow?

1039
00:51:52,157 --> 00:51:54,358
- Red Uprising?
- There will be no Red Uprising.

1040
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:57,561
The governor says the situation
calls for the militia.

1041
00:51:57,641 --> 00:52:01,003
I say anything the governor says
is a tissue of lies.

1042
00:52:01,204 --> 00:52:03,684
Here's a red-hot
statement from the governor.

1043
00:52:03,885 --> 00:52:06,287
He claims the mayor and
sheriff have shown themselves...

1044
00:52:07,269 --> 00:52:09,369
...to be a couple of 8-year-olds
playing with fire.

1045
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,251
You can quote him as follows:

1046
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:14,932
"It's lucky that next Tuesday
is Election Day...

1047
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:18,215
...as the citizens will be saved
the expense of impeaching...

1048
00:52:18,295 --> 00:52:20,976
...the mayor and the sheriff."
Call you back.

1049
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:22,817
Nice to have seen you, mayor.

1050
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:26,180
- I've got so much to do.
- Wait. Who engineered this getaway?

1051
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,101
- Was it the Reds?
- Was it you?

1052
00:52:28,181 --> 00:52:30,503
Me? Just a minute.
I've got him located.

1053
00:52:30,702 --> 00:52:31,664
- Williams?
- Where?

1054
00:52:31,824 --> 00:52:33,585
Out on Center Street. I got a tip.

1055
00:52:33,744 --> 00:52:35,865
- Why didn't you say so?
- The rifle squad's going.

1056
00:52:36,146 --> 00:52:37,788
You'll catch him if you hurry.

1057
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,628
- Please...
- I wanna talk to you.

1058
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:40,789
I've got a lot to do.

1059
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,352
- See here, Fred...
- Pete, you're through.

1060
00:52:43,552 --> 00:52:44,713
You mean I'm through?

1061
00:52:44,992 --> 00:52:48,755
I'm scratching your name off the ticket
and running Sherman in your place.

1062
00:52:48,954 --> 00:52:51,717
"Reform the Red with a rope"!
Williams isn't a Red!

1063
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,599
There's communistic
sympathizers around, and I thought...

1064
00:52:54,798 --> 00:52:56,721
...if I got a slogan
like that I could...

1065
00:52:57,001 --> 00:52:59,122
That's got nothing
to do with this case.

1066
00:52:59,322 --> 00:53:02,965
There are 200,000 votes at stake.
If he don't hang, we'll lose them.

1067
00:53:03,164 --> 00:53:05,646
We're going to hang him.
He can't get away.

1068
00:53:05,847 --> 00:53:08,168
What do you mean?
He did get away, didn't he?

1069
00:53:08,327 --> 00:53:09,970
What do you want?

1070
00:53:10,168 --> 00:53:12,090
- What is it?
- Are you Sheriff Hartwell?

1071
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:13,811
I'm him. What is it?

1072
00:53:14,012 --> 00:53:17,940
You're a hard man to find.
I have a message from the governor.

1073
00:53:17,775 --> 00:53:19,856
- What?
- It was a reprieve for Earl Williams.

1074
00:53:20,056 --> 00:53:22,369
- For who?
- Earl Williams.

1075
00:53:21,697 --> 00:53:23,898
You said there wasn't
gonna be a reprieve.

1076
00:53:24,179 --> 00:53:27,541
It frightens me to think of what
I'd like to do to you. Who was there?

1077
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,862
- Nobody. He was fishing.
- Get the governor.

1078
00:53:30,063 --> 00:53:31,784
He's not there.
He's duck shooting.

1079
00:53:31,983 --> 00:53:34,585
Blasted nimrod!
Fishing, duck shooting...

1080
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:37,146
A guy who's done nothing
for 40 years...

1081
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:39,389
...gets elected governor,
and thinks he's Tarzan.

1082
00:53:39,548 --> 00:53:42,831
Read that. "Insane." He knows
very well Williams isn't insane.

1083
00:53:43,032 --> 00:53:44,552
I never met the man.

1084
00:53:44,751 --> 00:53:46,954
- Pure politics.
- It's an attempt to ruin us.

1085
00:53:47,153 --> 00:53:52,170
- What do we tell the reporters?
- That the party's over because of you.

1086
00:53:51,677 --> 00:53:54,358
As an afterthought, tell them
I want your resignation.

1087
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,681
Hello. Yes, yes, this is Hartwell.

1088
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,121
What? Where?

1089
00:53:59,162 --> 00:54:00,682
Holy Moses! Hold the wire!

1090
00:54:00,883 --> 00:54:02,043
They've got Williams!

1091
00:54:02,244 --> 00:54:04,045
The rifle squad has him
at his house.

1092
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:06,567
- Tell them to hold the phone.
- Hold the wire.

1093
00:54:06,567 --> 00:54:09,528
Cover up that transmitter.
Now, listen.

1094
00:54:09,729 --> 00:54:11,090
You never arrived.

1095
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:13,092
Yes, I did. I came through there...

1096
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:16,329
- How much do you make?
- I thought he was sheriff...

1097
00:54:15,773 --> 00:54:17,539
- What's your salary?
- $40 a week.

1098
00:54:17,615 --> 00:54:20,695
How'd you like to make $350 a month?
It's almost $100 a week.

1099
00:54:20,856 --> 00:54:22,697
I couldn't afford that. Who? Me?

1100
00:54:22,898 --> 00:54:25,660
They need a fellow like you
in the city sealer's office.

1101
00:54:25,858 --> 00:54:27,021
- Huh?
- City sealer's.

1102
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,023
I should work in the sealer's...

1103
00:54:29,222 --> 00:54:34,050
My wife wouldn't like that. She lives
in the country with my family.

1104
00:54:33,664 --> 00:54:37,307
That's all right. Bring her in.
We'll pay all the expenses.

1105
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:39,690
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

1106
00:54:39,588 --> 00:54:42,871
I got two kids in school. If they
change towns, they'll lose a grade.

1107
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,512
No. They'll skip a grade.

1108
00:54:44,592 --> 00:54:46,713
I guarantee
they'll graduate with honours.

1109
00:54:46,994 --> 00:54:48,835
Hold your horses, Olsen.
Hurry up.

1110
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:50,076
Now, what do you say?

1111
00:54:50,277 --> 00:54:51,997
That puts me in a peculiar hole.

1112
00:54:52,197 --> 00:54:54,199
No, it doesn't.
You never delivered this.

1113
00:54:54,398 --> 00:54:56,519
You got caught in traffic
or something.

1114
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,240
- I came...
- Pretend you didn't.

1115
00:54:58,521 --> 00:55:00,923
Now get out and don't let
anybody see you.

1116
00:55:01,043 --> 00:55:03,325
- How do I know...?
- Come to my office tomorrow.

1117
00:55:03,525 --> 00:55:04,965
- What's your name?
- Pettibone.

1118
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:07,099
- Pettibone?
- Not really.

1119
00:55:06,606 --> 00:55:09,200
Lay low and keep your mouth shut.

1120
00:55:08,608 --> 00:55:10,530
- I'm tired anyhow.
- Go to this address.

1121
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:11,690
Nice homey place.

1122
00:55:11,971 --> 00:55:14,291
They'll take care of you.
Say Fred sent you.

1123
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,940
- Here's $50 on account.
- I'll tell you in one minute.

1124
00:55:17,653 --> 00:55:19,936
You forgot to tell me
what a city sealer does.

1125
00:55:20,135 --> 00:55:21,777
- Is it hard?
- Easy. Very easy.

1126
00:55:21,978 --> 00:55:23,898
Good, my health isn't...
My wife...

1127
00:55:24,099 --> 00:55:25,619
- We'll fix that too.
- My wife?

1128
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:29,262
- Yes, fix anything. Go ahead.
- They're still on the phone.

1129
00:55:30,019 --> 00:55:33,105
- Tell them to shoot to kill.
- But the reprieve!

1130
00:55:33,305 --> 00:55:35,506
- Go ahead and do as I tell you.
- Olsen.

1131
00:55:35,787 --> 00:55:38,188
Shoot to kill. That's the order.
Pass the word.

1132
00:55:38,387 --> 00:55:40,789
- $500 reward.
- $500 for the man who does it.

1133
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:42,231
I'll be right over.

1134
00:55:44,753 --> 00:55:45,793
Hi, Hildy.

1135
00:55:45,992 --> 00:55:47,914
You double-crossing hyena.

1136
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:50,115
What'd you pull on
Mr. Baldwin this time?

1137
00:55:50,396 --> 00:55:52,237
- Who, me?
- You and your albino.

1138
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:54,920
- Evangeline's no albino.
- She'll do till one comes along.

1139
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,760
She was born in this country.

1140
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,700
If she tries anything else,
she'll have to stay in this country.

1141
00:56:00,603 --> 00:56:03,846
- Did you bring that money?
- Oh, yeah, $400.

1142
00:56:04,045 --> 00:56:06,269
$450.

1143
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,849
All right, you can't blame
a guy for trying.

1144
00:56:09,048 --> 00:56:10,568
- Give me a receipt.
- I'll give you a scar.

1145
00:56:10,769 --> 00:56:11,930
I got plenty of them.

1146
00:56:12,131 --> 00:56:13,731
I'll take Mr. Baldwin's wallet too.

1147
00:56:13,932 --> 00:56:16,333
- Mr. Baldwin's what?
- His purse. Come on, Louie.

1148
00:56:16,614 --> 00:56:19,816
All right, Hildy. I'll do it for you
because I like you.

1149
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:22,858
But tell your financier to be
more careful, know what I mean?

1150
00:56:23,177 --> 00:56:25,260
I'll loan him a pair of
your brass knuckles.

1151
00:56:25,579 --> 00:56:27,381
Don't talk that way.
I'll take that.

1152
00:56:27,581 --> 00:56:29,619
- I'll take it to the station.
- Wait a minute!

1153
00:56:29,702 --> 00:56:32,785
Take it to the 27th Precinct
and tell the cops what happened.

1154
00:56:32,945 --> 00:56:35,066
I couldn't do that.
Burns would turn me in.

1155
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:36,987
- Not a bad idea.
- Here, catch!

1156
00:56:37,188 --> 00:56:38,228
Louie!

1157
00:56:46,994 --> 00:56:49,596
Hello, operator. Hildy Johnson.
Will you get me...

1158
00:56:49,756 --> 00:56:51,396
Drop that phone!

1159
00:56:51,597 --> 00:56:52,838
Never mind.

1160
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,400
You're not gonna
tell anybody where I am.

1161
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:02,240
Put that gun down, Earl.

1162
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:05,727
You don't wanna shoot me.
I'm your friend, remember?

1163
00:57:05,927 --> 00:57:08,608
I'm writing the story on you
of production for use.

1164
00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:12,251
- That's right. Production for use.
- You don't want to hurt me...

1165
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,052
Don't move!
Maybe you're my friend, maybe not.

1166
00:57:15,213 --> 00:57:16,374
But don't come any nearer.

1167
00:57:16,653 --> 00:57:19,175
You can't trust anybody
in this crazy world.

1168
00:57:19,376 --> 00:57:22,579
I don't blame you.
I wouldn't trust anybody either.

1169
00:57:22,538 --> 00:57:25,019
Don't do that.
Put it back. Put it back.

1170
00:57:25,219 --> 00:57:28,983
If you try any tricks, I'll shoot you.
I can do it right from here.

1171
00:57:29,622 --> 00:57:32,503
Sure you could, Earl.
But you don't want to do that.

1172
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:34,345
You don't want to kill anybody.

1173
00:57:34,746 --> 00:57:37,507
No, you're right.
I don't want to kill anybody.

1174
00:57:37,907 --> 00:57:40,990
- That's what I thought.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

1175
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:43,192
To close the door
so nobody'd see you.

1176
00:57:43,392 --> 00:57:45,193
No, you were going
to get somebody.

1177
00:57:45,313 --> 00:57:47,713
I don't want that.
All I want is to be left alone.

1178
00:57:47,795 --> 00:57:49,235
I won't get anybody.

1179
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,559
You'll get them after me again.
I won't let you do that. I won't...

1180
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:58,210
- Give me that.
- I guess I fired all the shells.

1181
00:57:58,161 --> 00:58:01,840
- I'm awful tired.
- That shot. They'll know you're here.

1182
00:58:01,643 --> 00:58:02,684
I don't care.

1183
00:58:02,965 --> 00:58:06,608
I'm not afraid to die. I told the
guy that when he handed me the gun.

1184
00:58:06,807 --> 00:58:08,889
- Quiet!
- Waking me up at night.

1185
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:10,769
Talking about things
they don't understand.

1186
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:12,090
Shut up.

1187
00:58:12,371 --> 00:58:14,519
I wish they'd take me back
and hang me.

1188
00:58:14,613 --> 00:58:16,213
They will if you don't keep quiet.

1189
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,255
I can't survive
another day like this.

1190
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:20,360
You think I could?

1191
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:23,590
Get me Walter Burns, quick.
Tell him I need him.

1192
00:58:26,621 --> 00:58:29,782
Bruce, I know I said I'd be down,
but something has happened.

1193
00:58:30,063 --> 00:58:32,865
Walter, come right away.
Wait, Bruce, I'll explain.

1194
00:58:33,025 --> 00:58:35,266
I've got Williams here,
in the press room.

1195
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:36,787
On the level.
I need you!

1196
00:58:37,067 --> 00:58:39,950
Bruce, I've captured Earl Williams.
You know, the murderer.

1197
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,550
Stay there, Earl. Wait.
Bruce, I'll be down.

1198
00:58:42,751 --> 00:58:45,119
As soon as I hand him
to the paper.

1199
00:58:44,673 --> 00:58:47,074
Bruce, I can't.
Don't you realize...?

1200
00:58:48,394 --> 00:58:51,597
- Who is it?
- Me, Mollie Malloy. Open the door!

1201
00:58:52,557 --> 00:58:54,838
- What do you want, Mollie?
- I got to find...

1202
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:56,681
- Where is everybody?
- They've gone.

1203
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,500
Please tell me where.

1204
00:58:58,602 --> 00:59:00,242
I don't know.
I'm awfully busy.

1205
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,005
They got him surrounded.
They'll shoot him like a dog.

1206
00:59:03,204 --> 00:59:04,646
They're looking for you too.

1207
00:59:04,726 --> 00:59:07,128
I don't care. Tell me.
I ain't afraid of them.

1208
00:59:07,327 --> 00:59:10,010
All right, they're down at
Center Street and Fourth.

1209
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:13,211
- That's where he used to...
- Mollie, don't go.

1210
00:59:13,372 --> 00:59:15,693
Come in, Mollie. Draw up a chair.

1211
00:59:18,095 --> 00:59:19,936
- Hello.
- How did you get in here?

1212
00:59:20,096 --> 00:59:24,590
Down the pipe. I didn't mean to
shoot him. Really, I didn't.

1213
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:26,660
- Be quiet.
- You believe me, don't you?

1214
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:27,901
Sure I believe you.

1215
00:59:28,102 --> 00:59:30,583
Thanks for the roses.
They were beautiful.

1216
00:59:30,782 --> 00:59:34,050
That's all right, Mr. Williams.

1217
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,028
- Don't cry.
- Don't you get hysterical.

1218
00:59:37,228 --> 00:59:38,548
I gotta get him out of here.

1219
00:59:38,749 --> 00:59:41,710
- You wouldn't get down that hall.
- They'll find him.

1220
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:44,512
I'm trying to think before
those reporters come back.

1221
00:59:44,593 --> 00:59:46,740
Let them take me.
What's the difference?

1222
00:59:46,514 --> 00:59:48,075
I'll never let them.

1223
00:59:49,036 --> 00:59:51,160
Who locked the door?

1224
00:59:51,637 --> 00:59:54,039
- Now it's too late.
- Get in this desk.

1225
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:56,240
- Oh, what's the use?
- Come on, get in.

1226
00:59:59,802 --> 01:00:01,604
We'll get you out in ten minutes.

1227
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,869
Pull yourself together.
All right, here. Sit down.

1228
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:09,209
All right, all right,
I'm coming!

1229
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:14,093
- Don't kick the building down.
- We got phone calls to make.

1230
01:00:14,291 --> 01:00:15,932
What's she doing up here?

1231
01:00:16,133 --> 01:00:17,375
What's the matter?

1232
01:00:17,575 --> 01:00:20,360
Came up here and had hysterics.

1233
01:00:19,655 --> 01:00:22,369
- How do you feel, kid?
- Not so good.

1234
01:00:21,697 --> 01:00:22,858
Get you some water?

1235
01:00:23,018 --> 01:00:25,599
- Do anything for you?
- You don't look so sick.

1236
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,661
- Did you bump into Williams?
- Funny!

1237
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:30,019
- Where is he?
- Let me alone.

1238
01:00:29,663 --> 01:00:31,983
- Okay. Give me the desk.
- No harm in asking.

1239
01:00:32,144 --> 01:00:35,626
Hello, Jim. Yes, false alarm.
They surrounded the house, all right...

1240
01:00:35,706 --> 01:00:37,347
...but Williams wasn't there.

1241
01:00:37,548 --> 01:00:39,949
The Halloween outside has
the police on its ear.

1242
01:00:40,229 --> 01:00:42,550
- I thought you left.
- I'm waiting for Walter's money.

1243
01:00:42,831 --> 01:00:44,552
What a chase! Give me Emil.

1244
01:00:44,753 --> 01:00:46,753
- Give me the desk.
- Any news, boys?

1245
01:00:46,954 --> 01:00:49,076
Yeah, I never been
so tired in my life.

1246
01:00:49,356 --> 01:00:50,597
Where?
Melrose Station?

1247
01:00:50,797 --> 01:00:52,998
All right, connect me.
Hello, Mollie. How are you?

1248
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:55,200
Hold it a minute.
This looks good.

1249
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,280
An old lady claims Williams
is hiding under her piazza.

1250
01:00:58,561 --> 01:01:00,003
Tell her to stand up.

1251
01:01:00,322 --> 01:01:02,805
- You want to go out on it?
- I'll cover this end.

1252
01:01:03,005 --> 01:01:06,086
- I spent $1.40 on taxicabs already.
- No more going out.

1253
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:09,280
- Never mind.
- Who pulled the shades down?

1254
01:01:08,768 --> 01:01:11,300
They were throwing lights around.

1255
01:01:17,014 --> 01:01:18,655
I've got a hunch Williams...

1256
01:01:18,856 --> 01:01:21,057
...ain't where they've been
looking for him.

1257
01:01:21,336 --> 01:01:22,979
He might be in this building.

1258
01:01:23,177 --> 01:01:26,340
Sure, hanging around
like a duck in a shooting gallery.

1259
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:28,742
From the skylight, but
how did he get down?

1260
01:01:28,942 --> 01:01:32,785
- I'm pretending there ain't any Earl.
- He could have jumped to this roof.

1261
01:01:32,864 --> 01:01:35,186
Then he could slide
down the drainpipe.

1262
01:01:35,387 --> 01:01:38,829
- And come in any of these windows.
- If the story walks in the window...

1263
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:42,590
Masterminds. Why don't you go home?
Maybe Williams will call on you.

1264
01:01:42,751 --> 01:01:44,673
It'd be funny if he was
in the building.

1265
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:46,514
Why not search the building?

1266
01:01:46,795 --> 01:01:49,876
- I'm not wandering all over.
- Great bunch of reporters you are.

1267
01:01:50,157 --> 01:01:52,197
Too lazy to get
the biggest story in years.

1268
01:01:52,358 --> 01:01:54,759
You seem pretty anxious
to get rid of us.

1269
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,210
- Are you trying to scoop us?
- On my own time?

1270
01:01:57,641 --> 01:02:02,240
Maybe Mollie's been giving her
the story on how Williams got the gun.

1271
01:02:01,804 --> 01:02:02,764
I didn't do nothing.

1272
01:02:02,925 --> 01:02:04,965
- Come clean.
- Let the girl alone. She's...

1273
01:02:05,046 --> 01:02:06,287
Well?

1274
01:02:07,269 --> 01:02:07,927
Mrs. Baldwin. Mother.

1275
01:02:08,128 --> 01:02:11,771
Don't "Mother" me. Playing cat and
mouse and keeping my boy locked up.

1276
01:02:11,971 --> 01:02:14,653
Making us miss two trains,
and the wedding tomorrow.

1277
01:02:14,853 --> 01:02:18,215
- I'll be with you in five minutes...
- Just give me Bruce's money.

1278
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:21,777
You can stay here forever,
you and that murderer you caught.

1279
01:02:21,978 --> 01:02:24,059
- Murderer?
- Which one of these men is it?

1280
01:02:24,259 --> 01:02:26,860
- They all look like murderers.
- What murderer?

1281
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:28,782
I never said any such thing.

1282
01:02:28,983 --> 01:02:32,039
I'm quoting my son.
He has never lied to me.

1283
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:32,625
Somebody's lying.

1284
01:02:32,825 --> 01:02:35,106
- I never said anything like that.
- You did.

1285
01:02:35,306 --> 01:02:37,708
I said I was trying
to find the murderer.

1286
01:02:37,827 --> 01:02:39,750
- Quit stalling.
- She got it balled up.

1287
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:41,550
Who are you holding out on?

1288
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:44,119
Nobody. Now let me go, will you?

1289
01:02:43,873 --> 01:02:45,394
Stop it, stop it!

1290
01:02:45,514 --> 01:02:49,356
She don't know where he is.
I'm the only one that knows.

1291
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:50,956
- Where?
- Try and find out.

1292
01:02:51,157 --> 01:02:53,679
- Come on, talk.
- Now you want me to talk?

1293
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:56,200
- Talk.
- Ain't that funny?

1294
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,842
You wouldn't listen to me before,
and now you want me to talk.

1295
01:02:59,043 --> 01:03:00,003
Don't say anything.

1296
01:03:00,282 --> 01:03:01,925
- I know what I'm doing.
- Stay out.

1297
01:03:02,124 --> 01:03:04,326
- Why didn't you listen to me?
- Cut that out.

1298
01:03:04,525 --> 01:03:06,047
- Hands off!
- Where is he?

1299
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:09,608
Why do you wanna know? So you can
write more lies to sell papers?

1300
01:03:09,809 --> 01:03:13,372
- Never mind that.
- All right. I'll give you a story.

1301
01:03:13,652 --> 01:03:14,613
A wonderful story!

1302
01:03:14,893 --> 01:03:18,335
Only this time it'll be true.
You'll never find him now!

1303
01:03:18,815 --> 01:03:20,577
Get the ambulance, somebody!

1304
01:03:20,737 --> 01:03:22,378
Get an ambulance, somebody!

1305
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:28,902
- She's dead.
- No, she isn't killed, she's moving!

1306
01:03:33,144 --> 01:03:36,027
- Did you see that? She jumped.
- I know that.

1307
01:03:36,228 --> 01:03:37,548
Where have you got Williams?

1308
01:03:37,749 --> 01:03:39,670
Hidden. He's in the desk.

1309
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:41,110
She didn't kill herself.

1310
01:03:41,391 --> 01:03:42,831
- How're you doing?
- Let me out.

1311
01:03:43,032 --> 01:03:44,592
Quiet. You're sitting pretty.

1312
01:03:44,753 --> 01:03:46,394
- What's in there?
- Who are you?

1313
01:03:46,594 --> 01:03:48,595
- Bruce's mother.
- What are you doing?

1314
01:03:48,796 --> 01:03:50,836
- Shut up!
- You're doing something wrong.

1315
01:03:50,997 --> 01:03:52,918
- Mother, please.
- Take her out of here.

1316
01:03:53,117 --> 01:03:56,880
- Take the lady to Polack Mike's.
- My name's Louie Peluso.

1317
01:03:58,602 --> 01:04:02,849
See that she doesn't talk to anyone.
Tell them it's a case of D.T.'s.

1318
01:04:02,644 --> 01:04:04,566
Don't worry, Mother.
It's temporary.

1319
01:04:05,047 --> 01:04:06,767
Let go of me.

1320
01:04:07,327 --> 01:04:09,929
- Where are you going?
- To get Bruce out of jail.

1321
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:13,572
- Why did you do this to me?
- Get Bruce out of jail?

1322
01:04:13,771 --> 01:04:17,055
How can you worry about a man
resting in a police station?

1323
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:20,135
- This is war! You can't desert me.
- Get off that trapeze.

1324
01:04:20,217 --> 01:04:21,577
You've got your story.

1325
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:24,340
<i>"Earl Williams captured
by the Morning Post."</i>

1326
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:26,941
I covered your story for you,
now I'm out.

1327
01:04:27,141 --> 01:04:31,664
You drooling idiot, there are 365 days
in a year one can get married.

1328
01:04:31,744 --> 01:04:34,626
How many times you got a murderer
locked up in a desk?

1329
01:04:34,826 --> 01:04:37,028
You got the city
by the seat of the pants.

1330
01:04:37,307 --> 01:04:39,229
You've got the brain of a pancake.

1331
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:41,831
This isn't just a story.
It's a revolution.

1332
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:44,793
The greatest yarn since
Livingston discovered Stanley.

1333
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:48,556
- The other way around.
- Don't get technical at such a time.

1334
01:04:48,756 --> 01:04:51,517
You've taken a city that's been
graft-ridden for 40 years...

1335
01:04:51,717 --> 01:04:54,719
...and given us a chance to have
the kind of government...

1336
01:04:54,878 --> 01:04:56,809
...New York has under La Guardia.

1337
01:04:56,641 --> 01:05:00,564
If I didn't have your best interest
at heart, I wouldn't argue with you.

1338
01:05:00,762 --> 01:05:04,326
You've done something big.
You've stepped up into a new class.

1339
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:08,248
We'll make such monkeys of those
ward heelers, nobody'll vote for them.

1340
01:05:08,889 --> 01:05:10,250
- Expose them?
- We'll crucify that mob.

1341
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,331
We'll keep Williams undercover
until we break the story...

1342
01:05:13,532 --> 01:05:15,373
...then share the glory
with the governor.

1343
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,855
- I get it, I get it.
- You'll kick over City Hall.

1344
01:05:18,056 --> 01:05:21,778
You got the mayor and Hartwell
backed up against the wall.

1345
01:05:21,978 --> 01:05:24,778
This isn't just a newspaper story.
It's a career!

1346
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:28,021
And you bellyache about catching
the 8 or 9:00 train.

1347
01:05:28,222 --> 01:05:31,784
- But I never figured it that way.
- Because you're a doll-faced hick.

1348
01:05:31,985 --> 01:05:35,347
They'll be naming streets after you.
There'll be statues of you.

1349
01:05:35,546 --> 01:05:38,588
The movies will be after you.
There'll be a Hildy cigar.

1350
01:05:38,789 --> 01:05:41,791
I can see the billboards:
"Light up with Hildy Johnson"...

1351
01:05:41,951 --> 01:05:43,872
- We got a lot to do.
- Now you're talking.

1352
01:05:44,072 --> 01:05:48,195
- We can't leave Williams here.
- We'll take him to my private office.

1353
01:05:48,396 --> 01:05:51,398
- How are you gonna take him?
- We'll carry the desk over.

1354
01:05:51,557 --> 01:05:53,199
It's crawling with cops outside.

1355
01:05:53,398 --> 01:05:57,240
We'll lower it out the window with
pulleys. Start pounding out a lead!

1356
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:01,163
- How much of this stuff do you want?
- All the words you got.

1357
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,646
- Can I call the mayor a bird of prey?
- Anything you like.

1358
01:06:04,846 --> 01:06:08,769
Give him the works. Hello, Duffy?
We got the biggest story in years.

1359
01:06:08,969 --> 01:06:12,131
<i>"Earl Williams captured by
the Morning Post. Exclusive!"</i>

1360
01:06:12,331 --> 01:06:13,972
Tear out the whole front page.

1361
01:06:14,133 --> 01:06:17,014
The whole front page.
Never mind the European war.

1362
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:20,697
We got something bigger than that.
Hildy Johnson's writing the lead.

1363
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,778
And get hold of Butch O'Connor.

1364
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,099
Tell him to come up here
with his wrestlers.

1365
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:29,030
Yeah, Butch O'Connor. What?
I've got a desk I want moved...

1366
01:06:28,662 --> 01:06:29,983
What the deuce do you want?

1367
01:06:30,182 --> 01:06:31,264
- Hello, Bruce.
- Hildy.

1368
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:33,664
Never mind the Chinese earthquake.

1369
01:06:33,826 --> 01:06:36,227
- I want to ask you...
- How'd you get out of jail?

1370
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:39,690
Not through any help of yours.
I'm not talking to you.

1371
01:06:39,588 --> 01:06:43,753
I had to wire Albany for $100
so I could get out on bail.

1372
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:48,150
What will they think in Albany?
The money went to the police.

1373
01:06:47,595 --> 01:06:50,836
- We're waiting for that story.
- We'll explain everything to them.

1374
01:06:51,037 --> 01:06:52,677
- Where's Mother?
- She left.

1375
01:06:52,878 --> 01:06:53,838
I can't hear you.

1376
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:55,559
- Where'd she go?
- Someplace.

1377
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,802
- Junk the Polish Corridor!
- Tell me where she was going.

1378
01:06:59,001 --> 01:07:01,043
- She couldn't say.
- It's more important.

1379
01:07:01,204 --> 01:07:03,849
- Did she get the money?
- She left in a hurry.

1380
01:07:03,606 --> 01:07:05,247
- I'll take it.
- In my purse.

1381
01:07:05,869 --> 01:07:09,300
I can handle things.
I'll take that certified check too.

1382
01:07:08,528 --> 01:07:11,891
I'll give you the tickets.
You'll find your money in the wallet.

1383
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:14,293
My wallet? This is my wallet.

1384
01:07:15,329 --> 01:07:17,255
There's something funny going on...
What are you doing?

1385
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,296
Just wanted to look at it.

1386
01:07:19,376 --> 01:07:21,097
Hildy, I'm taking...

1387
01:07:21,777 --> 01:07:24,378
- I'm taking the 9:00 train.
- Sure, sure.

1388
01:07:24,579 --> 01:07:27,742
Did you hear what I said?
I'm taking the 9:00...

1389
01:07:27,942 --> 01:07:29,742
Oh, Bruce, I put it in here!

1390
01:07:31,664 --> 01:07:33,506
Let her alone, will you, buddy?

1391
01:07:33,706 --> 01:07:36,186
- Do me a favour...
- Just answer one question.

1392
01:07:36,387 --> 01:07:38,189
You don't want to come
with me, do you?

1393
01:07:38,509 --> 01:07:39,829
Answer me.
You don't, do you?

1394
01:07:39,949 --> 01:07:42,512
No. Take the Miss America
pictures off page six.

1395
01:07:42,711 --> 01:07:44,552
Hildy, tell me.
Tell me the truth.

1396
01:07:44,753 --> 01:07:47,514
Wait a minute.
Now look here, my good man...

1397
01:07:47,715 --> 01:07:49,356
You shut up, Burns.

1398
01:07:49,556 --> 01:07:53,079
You're doing all this to her.
She wanted to get away from you.

1399
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:55,200
But you caught her
and changed her mind...

1400
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,881
Stick Hitler on the funny page.
Let me ask you...

1401
01:07:58,081 --> 01:08:01,230
Will you give up everything
for a man like him?

1402
01:08:00,684 --> 01:08:03,085
No, but something's happened.
I'll tell you...

1403
01:08:03,164 --> 01:08:05,206
Tell him nothing.
He's a spy, you fool.

1404
01:08:06,099 --> 01:08:06,648
- I am not.
- Ridiculous.

1405
01:08:06,847 --> 01:08:08,369
You're coming with me right now.

1406
01:08:08,568 --> 01:08:11,050
Just a second.
This is the biggest thing in my life.

1407
01:08:11,251 --> 01:08:14,052
I see. I'll keep.
I'm like something in the icebox.

1408
01:08:14,213 --> 01:08:15,773
You just don't love me.

1409
01:08:16,054 --> 01:08:20,360
That isn't true. Just because you
won't listen you say I don't love you.

1410
01:08:19,697 --> 01:08:22,579
You never intended to be decent
and live like a human.

1411
01:08:22,778 --> 01:08:26,010
All right, if that's what
you want to think.

1412
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:27,181
I'm trying to concentrate.

1413
01:08:27,381 --> 01:08:30,544
- You're just like him and all the rest.
- That's what I am.

1414
01:08:30,744 --> 01:08:33,825
What? Leave the rooster story alone.
That's human interest.

1415
01:08:34,306 --> 01:08:36,228
If you had any sympathy
or understanding...

1416
01:08:36,508 --> 01:08:38,349
- I understand, all right...
- Wait.

1417
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:43,110
There's one question I want to know.
The mayor's first wife's name.

1418
01:08:42,671 --> 01:08:45,073
The one with the wart on her? Fanny.
What, Duffy?

1419
01:08:45,274 --> 01:08:46,795
You never loved me at all.

1420
01:08:46,995 --> 01:08:49,116
Never mind.
You don't work for advertising.

1421
01:08:49,276 --> 01:08:51,998
If you change your mind,
I'm on the 9:00 train.

1422
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:55,040
If you want me, take me as I am.
Don't try to change me.

1423
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,641
I'm no suburban bridge player.
I'm a newspaperman.

1424
01:08:57,762 --> 01:08:59,963
That's it. Keep it coming
as fast as you can.

1425
01:09:00,164 --> 01:09:02,364
Get back in there, you mock turtle.

1426
01:09:04,767 --> 01:09:07,169
Did you tell Butch it's a matter
of life and death?

1427
01:09:07,368 --> 01:09:10,500
Good. Butch's on his way. We just
have to hold out for 15 minutes.

1428
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:13,612
- The boys will be back to phone.
- I'll handle them.

1429
01:09:15,053 --> 01:09:17,335
Oh, now the moon's out.

1430
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:24,180
Fine. Three taps is me.
Don't forget. Got enough air?

1431
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:27,222
- Not very much.
- That better? You're sitting pretty.

1432
01:09:27,701 --> 01:09:29,943
- How's it coming?
- All right. Where's Bruce?

1433
01:09:30,104 --> 01:09:31,944
- He went out.
- Is he coming back here?

1434
01:09:32,145 --> 01:09:34,907
Certainly. Didn't you hear him?
What have you got?

1435
01:09:35,026 --> 01:09:38,750
"While Hartwell's paid gunmen stalked
the city, shooting bystanders...

1436
01:09:38,949 --> 01:09:40,790
...spreading terror,
Williams lurked..."

1437
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:43,552
<i>Wait a minute.
Aren't you going to mention the Post?</i>

1438
01:09:43,753 --> 01:09:46,354
- Second paragraph.
- Who reads the second paragraph?

1439
01:09:46,554 --> 01:09:48,836
How long have I been
telling you how to write?

1440
01:09:49,036 --> 01:09:49,996
I'm sorry.

1441
01:09:53,559 --> 01:09:55,680
What's the idea of locking this door?

1442
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:57,881
- Who's that?
- Bensinger. That's his desk.

1443
01:09:58,082 --> 01:10:00,363
Open the door, will you?

1444
01:10:00,684 --> 01:10:02,765
<i>- What's his name?
- Bensinger, of The Tribune.</i>

1445
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:05,000
<i>- The Tribune?
- Who's in there?</i>

1446
01:10:06,328 --> 01:10:07,969
Haven't you any better sense...?

1447
01:10:08,169 --> 01:10:11,812
Hello. Hello, Mr. Burns. Quite
an honour having you come over here.

1448
01:10:12,011 --> 01:10:15,734
- Hello, Bensinger.
- You know my... I just want to get my...

1449
01:10:15,934 --> 01:10:18,736
It's quite a coincidence
seeing you tonight, isn't it?

1450
01:10:18,936 --> 01:10:19,896
How do you mean?

1451
01:10:20,056 --> 01:10:22,858
I was talking to our Mr. Duffy
about you this afternoon.

1452
01:10:23,059 --> 01:10:24,860
Really? Nothing detrimental, I hope.

1453
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:27,102
On the contrary. On the contrary.

1454
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:29,983
That was one swell story
you had in the paper today.

1455
01:10:30,063 --> 01:10:32,065
Did you care for the
poem, Mr. Burns?

1456
01:10:32,265 --> 01:10:35,827
- The poem? The poem was great.
- I liked the ending a lot.

1457
01:10:36,027 --> 01:10:37,548
<i>And all is well outside his cell</i>

1458
01:10:37,749 --> 01:10:39,870
<i>But in his heart
He hears the hangman calling</i>

1459
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:43,993
<i>And the gallows falling
And his white-haired mother's tears</i>

1460
01:10:44,192 --> 01:10:45,740
- Heartbreaking?
- Fine.

1461
01:10:45,713 --> 01:10:48,595
Would you like to work for me?
We can use a man like you.

1462
01:10:48,796 --> 01:10:50,917
All we got are lowbrows
like Johnson here.

1463
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:53,799
- Are you serious, Mr. Burns?
- Serious? Wait a minute.

1464
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,281
Duffy, I'm sending
Mr. Bunsinger over to see you.

1465
01:10:56,561 --> 01:10:57,922
- Bensinger.
- Mervyn, isn't it?

1466
01:10:58,002 --> 01:11:00,604
- Yeah... No. Roy. Roy V.
- Certainly.

1467
01:11:00,804 --> 01:11:02,646
Roy V. Bensinger, the poet.

1468
01:11:02,806 --> 01:11:06,568
You wouldn't know. You probably never
heard of Shakespeare either.

1469
01:11:08,008 --> 01:11:11,171
<i>Put Mr. Bensinger on staff.
How much you getting on The Tribune?</i>

1470
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,372
- $75.
- I'll give you 100 and a byline.

1471
01:11:13,573 --> 01:11:16,574
Now you give him everything he wants,
you understand?

1472
01:11:16,734 --> 01:11:20,580
Roy, write me a story from the
point of view of the escaped man.

1473
01:11:20,578 --> 01:11:22,819
He hides, afraid of every sound,
every light.

1474
01:11:23,099 --> 01:11:25,380
He hears footsteps, they're closing in.

1475
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:29,223
- Get the sense of the animal at bay.
- Sort of Jack London style?

1476
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:32,640
- I'll get my rhyming dictionary.
- It doesn't have to rhyme.

1477
01:11:32,585 --> 01:11:34,627
I'm deeply grateful, Mr. Burns.

1478
01:11:36,267 --> 01:11:39,090
If there's an opening
for a war correspondent...

1479
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:40,110
<i>...I parler a little French.</i>

1480
01:11:40,271 --> 01:11:42,672
<i>- I'll keep you in mind.
- Au revoir, mon capitaine.</i>

1481
01:11:42,872 --> 01:11:43,953
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1482
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:50,077
"His white-haired mother's tears."
That's the tops.

1483
01:11:50,277 --> 01:11:52,879
That fellow Bensinger
is on his way right now.

1484
01:11:53,078 --> 01:11:55,360
Handle him with kid gloves.
Have him write poetry.

1485
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,882
We don't want him.
Stall him till the extra's out.

1486
01:11:58,043 --> 01:12:00,083
Say his poetry smells
and kick him out.

1487
01:12:00,284 --> 01:12:01,604
Double-crosser.

1488
01:12:01,805 --> 01:12:04,206
He won't quit his paper
without giving notice.

1489
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:05,367
- I mean you.
- Me?

1490
01:12:05,648 --> 01:12:07,968
You'd double-cross anybody...
Wait a minute.

1491
01:12:08,129 --> 01:12:11,010
Bruce isn't coming back.
He said he was taking the 9:00.

1492
01:12:11,211 --> 01:12:12,651
In that case, he's gone.

1493
01:12:12,852 --> 01:12:15,815
Don't sit there like a frozen robin.
Get on with the story.

1494
01:12:16,014 --> 01:12:18,056
We should be finished
when Butch arrives.

1495
01:12:18,216 --> 01:12:21,698
How you have messed up my life.
What am I going to do?

1496
01:12:21,898 --> 01:12:24,100
Window's too small.
We'll carry the desk.

1497
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,342
I'd be on that train now.
I'm a sap, falling for your line.

1498
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:30,824
- They'll name streets after me...
- Yes, well, get back to work.

1499
01:12:31,024 --> 01:12:33,305
I'm not going back to work.
Walter, what...?

1500
01:12:34,546 --> 01:12:36,388
- Who is it?
- It's me, boss. It's Louie.

1501
01:12:36,668 --> 01:12:37,828
Louie.

1502
01:12:39,349 --> 01:12:41,191
- What's wrong?
- Where's Mrs. Baldwin?

1503
01:12:41,391 --> 01:12:42,352
What happened?

1504
01:12:42,632 --> 01:12:46,275
Down Western Avenue, we was going
65 miles an hour, know what I mean?

1505
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:47,915
Where's the old lady?

1506
01:12:48,116 --> 01:12:50,718
We run smack into a police patrol.
Busted it in half.

1507
01:12:50,877 --> 01:12:52,038
Was she hurt?

1508
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:55,121
Can you imagine bumping
into a load of cops?

1509
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,082
- What did you do with her?
- Search me, when I come to...

1510
01:12:58,283 --> 01:13:00,323
You were with her.
You were in the cab.

1511
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,086
- The driver got knocked cold.
- Butterfingers!

1512
01:13:03,286 --> 01:13:05,967
- You handed her over to the cops.
- What do you mean?

1513
01:13:06,168 --> 01:13:08,170
They was on the wrong
side of the street.

1514
01:13:08,369 --> 01:13:10,770
Fine. Now she's probably
squawking to the police.

1515
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:12,972
She's not squawking much.
You know?

1516
01:13:13,172 --> 01:13:15,213
Don't tell me...
Was she killed?

1517
01:13:15,374 --> 01:13:16,655
Was she? Did you notice?

1518
01:13:16,815 --> 01:13:19,616
Me with a gun on the hip and
a kidnapped lady...

1519
01:13:19,817 --> 01:13:21,738
...I'm gonna ask questions
from cops?

1520
01:13:21,938 --> 01:13:25,581
- You know what I mean?
- Dead, dead. This is the end!

1521
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:28,183
It's fate, Hildy.
What will be, will be.

1522
01:13:28,343 --> 01:13:31,344
What am I going to say to Bruce?
What can I tell him?

1523
01:13:31,544 --> 01:13:33,746
If he loves you, you won't
have to say anything.

1524
01:13:33,946 --> 01:13:37,108
Would you rather have had the old
dame drag the police in here?

1525
01:13:37,188 --> 01:13:39,309
I killed her. I'm responsible.

1526
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:41,511
What'll I do?
How can I face Bruce again?

1527
01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:44,393
- Look at me, Hildy.
- I am looking at you, you murderer.

1528
01:13:44,593 --> 01:13:46,795
If it was my own grandmother,
I'd carry on.

1529
01:13:46,995 --> 01:13:49,877
- You know I would, for the paper.
- Louie, where'd it happen?

1530
01:13:50,277 --> 01:13:51,598
Western and 34th.

1531
01:13:51,798 --> 01:13:54,880
- I got to get out of here...
- We can do more here. Be calm.

1532
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,201
Listen...

1533
01:13:57,842 --> 01:14:00,840
- Hello, hello.
- Maine 4557.

1534
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:02,766
Who? Butch, where are you?

1535
01:14:02,926 --> 01:14:04,567
Mission Hospital?
Receiving room.

1536
01:14:04,767 --> 01:14:06,208
What are you doing there?

1537
01:14:06,288 --> 01:14:08,329
Was a lady brought in
from a smashup?

1538
01:14:08,529 --> 01:14:11,510
For H. Sebastian, Butch,
it's a matter of life and death.

1539
01:14:11,692 --> 01:14:13,530
- Nobody?
- I can't hear.

1540
01:14:13,693 --> 01:14:17,175
- Morningside 2469.
- You got who? Speak up. A what?

1541
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:19,577
You can't stop for a dame now!

1542
01:14:20,217 --> 01:14:23,099
I don't care if you've been after her.
Lives are at stake!

1543
01:14:23,298 --> 01:14:25,340
You're going to let a woman
come between us?

1544
01:14:25,501 --> 01:14:28,103
Was there an old lady brought in
in a smashup?

1545
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:30,784
Butch, I'd put my arm in fire
for you up to here.

1546
01:14:30,984 --> 01:14:32,345
You can't double-cross me.

1547
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:33,586
Look around, please.

1548
01:14:33,786 --> 01:14:35,787
All right, put her on.
I'll talk to her.

1549
01:14:35,988 --> 01:14:39,350
Good evening, madam. Now, listen,
you ten-cent glamour girl...

1550
01:14:39,549 --> 01:14:41,952
...you can't keep Butch
from his duty. What?

1551
01:14:42,151 --> 01:14:44,633
You say that again,
I'll kick you in the teeth!

1552
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:48,956
Say, what kind of language is that?
Now, look here, you...

1553
01:14:49,156 --> 01:14:51,277
She hung up. What did I say?

1554
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:55,121
How do you like that?
Mousing around with some big...

1555
01:14:55,281 --> 01:14:58,643
- Will you shut up? I'm trying to hear!
- That's cooperation.

1556
01:15:00,004 --> 01:15:01,724
Well, where is Duffy?

1557
01:15:02,886 --> 01:15:05,967
Diabetes. I should know better than
to hire a diseased person.

1558
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:08,369
- Give me Olympia 2136, will you?
- Louie!

1559
01:15:08,569 --> 01:15:10,171
- Yes, boss.
- Louie, it's up to you.

1560
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:12,893
- Anything you say, boss.
- Get a hold of some guys.

1561
01:15:13,053 --> 01:15:16,335
Anybody with hair on his chest,
get them off the street.

1562
01:15:16,535 --> 01:15:17,775
We gotta get the desk out.

1563
01:15:17,975 --> 01:15:20,377
Is it important?
You're the best friend I got.

1564
01:15:20,577 --> 01:15:22,299
- I like you too.
- Don't fail me.

1565
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,299
Get enough people to move that desk.

1566
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,221
You know me.
Shirt off my back.

1567
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:28,262
Okay, don't bump into anything.

1568
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:31,904
- Dumb immigrant is sure to flop on me.
- Try the hospital again.

1569
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:34,306
If he's not back in five,
we'll carry it out alone.

1570
01:15:34,506 --> 01:15:36,508
- Do anything you want.
- There's a million... Could start a fire.

1571
01:15:36,708 --> 01:15:39,390
- We'll have the firemen take it out.
- I don't care what you do.

1572
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:42,832
- Come here. See if we can lift it.
- What? Nobody? Never mind.

1573
01:15:43,032 --> 01:15:44,593
- Are you gonna help me?
- No!

1574
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:46,875
- I'll strain my back.
- I'll find Mrs. Baldwin.

1575
01:15:47,155 --> 01:15:49,076
- Don't open it!
- I'll go to the morgue...

1576
01:15:49,276 --> 01:15:52,639
- We want to talk to you a minute.
- Let go. What's the idea?

1577
01:15:52,919 --> 01:15:54,000
Get your hands off me!

1578
01:15:54,199 --> 01:15:56,121
- Now, look here, Johnson...
- Hey, you!

1579
01:15:56,201 --> 01:15:57,162
You mean me?

1580
01:15:57,362 --> 01:16:01,285
Yes, you. What do you mean by
breaking in here like this?

1581
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,886
I don't care what paper
you're editor of.

1582
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:07,329
Let go of me. Something's
happened to my mother-in-law.

1583
01:16:07,649 --> 01:16:12,052
- We know what you are up to.
- She and Mollie were in here talking.

1584
01:16:12,252 --> 01:16:14,373
I know nothing,
and there's been an accident.

1585
01:16:14,533 --> 01:16:16,935
There's something
very peculiar going on here.

1586
01:16:17,135 --> 01:16:19,057
- See here...
- Just a moment, Hartwell.

1587
01:16:19,256 --> 01:16:21,939
Make your accusations
in the proper manner.

1588
01:16:22,138 --> 01:16:24,140
Or I'll have to ask you to get out.

1589
01:16:24,259 --> 01:16:26,942
- Ask me to what?
- Get out.

1590
01:16:27,222 --> 01:16:30,864
You will, eh? Don't let anybody
in or out. We'll see about this.

1591
01:16:31,185 --> 01:16:33,866
- Give him the third degree.
- Make them talk and you got him.

1592
01:16:34,067 --> 01:16:37,308
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
Are you going to talk?

1593
01:16:37,690 --> 01:16:40,190
- What do you want me to say?
- What do you know about Williams?

1594
01:16:40,311 --> 01:16:42,232
Now we're getting some...

1595
01:16:42,392 --> 01:16:44,730
Take her out.
I got ways to make her talk.

1596
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:46,154
Don't you dare touch me or...

1597
01:16:46,915 --> 01:16:48,156
- She's got a gun!
- Grab it!

1598
01:16:48,356 --> 01:16:49,917
No, you don't. Walter!

1599
01:16:50,077 --> 01:16:53,640
All right, Burns.
I'll take that gun.

1600
01:16:53,759 --> 01:16:56,041
- Where did you get this?
- I can carry a gun.

1601
01:16:56,242 --> 01:16:57,962
- Not this gun.
- I can explain it.

1602
01:16:58,162 --> 01:17:02,005
She was interviewing Williams,
so I gave her a gun to defend herself.

1603
01:17:02,205 --> 01:17:05,928
Interesting. But this is the gun
that Williams shot his way out with.

1604
01:17:06,128 --> 01:17:08,890
Good man, are you trying
to make me out a liar?

1605
01:17:08,729 --> 01:17:10,731
I ought to know my own gun,
oughtn't I...?

1606
01:17:10,851 --> 01:17:13,252
- That's where Williams got it.
- She got it from him.

1607
01:17:13,533 --> 01:17:16,614
- Where's Williams?
- You're barking up the wrong tree.

1608
01:17:16,815 --> 01:17:18,336
Tell me where he is.

1609
01:17:18,536 --> 01:17:22,098
At the hospital calling on Professor
Egelhoffer with marshmallows.

1610
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:25,061
- Where is he?
- Ask the mastermind why he's here.

1611
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:28,022
- What do you know about this?
- My dear fellow...

1612
01:17:28,223 --> 01:17:31,384
<i>...the Morning Post doesn't obstruct
justice or hide criminals.</i>

1613
01:17:31,585 --> 01:17:33,906
- You ought to know that.
- You're under arrest.

1614
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:35,707
- You too.
- Who's under arrest?

1615
01:17:35,907 --> 01:17:38,109
Listen, you square-toed,
pimple-headed spy...

1616
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,351
...do you realize what you're doing?

1617
01:17:40,511 --> 01:17:41,592
I'll show you.

1618
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:43,793
<i>You and the Post
are obstructing justice.</i>

1619
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:47,075
- I'll see that you're fined $10,000.
- You'll see nothing.

1620
01:17:47,235 --> 01:17:50,518
<i>I'll begin by impounding the Post's
property. Is this your desk?</i>

1621
01:17:50,718 --> 01:17:53,679
What are you afraid of, Hildy?
I dare you to move this desk.

1622
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,521
- Go ahead, try it.
- I will.

1623
01:17:55,721 --> 01:17:58,883
I warn you, you move this desk out,
I'll put you behind bars.

1624
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:02,250
- He can do it.
- I'll see Roosevelt hears about it.

1625
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:03,086
Tell him. Come on, boys!

1626
01:18:03,286 --> 01:18:05,128
- Confiscate it.
- Last chance.

1627
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,690
- This is a federal offence.
- We'll take a chance on that.

1628
01:18:08,969 --> 01:18:09,930
All right.

1629
01:18:10,971 --> 01:18:12,520
Open up this door!

1630
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:17,215
- Mother! I'm glad to see you...
- That's the man that did it. There.

1631
01:18:20,297 --> 01:18:23,179
- What's the idea here?
- She claims she's been kidnapped.

1632
01:18:23,379 --> 01:18:26,261
They dragged me down all the way
down the stairs and...

1633
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:27,502
Did he do it?

1634
01:18:27,782 --> 01:18:30,384
He was in charge.
He told them to kidnap me.

1635
01:18:30,584 --> 01:18:33,065
Excuse me, madam.
Are you referring to me?

1636
01:18:33,266 --> 01:18:34,227
You know you did.

1637
01:18:34,506 --> 01:18:36,348
What about this? Kidnapping, huh?

1638
01:18:36,548 --> 01:18:39,589
Trying to frame me, huh?
I never saw her before in my life.

1639
01:18:39,790 --> 01:18:40,951
What a thing to say!

1640
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,753
I was here when that girl
jumped out the window.

1641
01:18:43,913 --> 01:18:44,994
Get the mayor here.

1642
01:18:45,194 --> 01:18:47,756
Madam, be honest.
If you were out joyriding...

1643
01:18:47,955 --> 01:18:51,038
...plastered, or in a scrape,
why not admit it instead of...

1644
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:53,190
...accusing innocent people?

1645
01:18:52,678 --> 01:18:55,280
You ruffian! How dare you talk
like that to me!

1646
01:18:55,810 --> 01:18:56,522
He's crazy, Mother.

1647
01:18:56,722 --> 01:18:59,604
I'll tell you more.
I could tell you why they did it.

1648
01:18:59,764 --> 01:19:02,166
They were hiding some
kind of murderer in here...

1649
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:03,806
Hiding him? In here?

1650
01:19:04,007 --> 01:19:06,608
Madam, you're a cockeyed liar...

1651
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:08,529
...and you know it!

1652
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:10,731
- What's that?
- He's in there!

1653
01:19:10,931 --> 01:19:12,572
- Give me the desk.
- What a break!

1654
01:19:12,652 --> 01:19:14,093
- Stand back.
- He might shoot.

1655
01:19:14,294 --> 01:19:15,334
- Guns out.
- He's harmless.

1656
01:19:15,534 --> 01:19:18,816
- Don't take any chances.
- You've got his gun.

1657
01:19:18,976 --> 01:19:21,017
Go on, you grey-haired old weasel.

1658
01:19:21,218 --> 01:19:22,990
Let me out of here!

1659
01:19:22,939 --> 01:19:25,541
Mother! I was looking
all over for you. What happened?

1660
01:19:25,701 --> 01:19:27,942
- Jake, hang on.
- Hildy, call Duffy.

1661
01:19:28,103 --> 01:19:29,744
- No!
- You want to see us scooped?

1662
01:19:29,944 --> 01:19:32,650
- Aim right for the centre.
- That's murder.

1663
01:19:32,626 --> 01:19:34,546
Okay, one of you get
on each end.

1664
01:19:34,667 --> 01:19:35,907
- It's coming up.
- You're covered.

1665
01:19:36,108 --> 01:19:37,229
- In a minute.
- Don't move.

1666
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,590
- Any time.
- On three.

1667
01:19:38,789 --> 01:19:40,711
- It's hot.
- Ready?

1668
01:19:40,911 --> 01:19:43,793
- Any second now.
- Three. I got you, Williams.

1669
01:19:43,953 --> 01:19:45,875
- Go ahead, shoot me.
- Come out.

1670
01:19:46,195 --> 01:19:49,156
Earl Williams just captured
in the criminal courts building.

1671
01:19:49,357 --> 01:19:52,038
- On your feet.
- Don't try any funny stuff.

1672
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:53,559
Williams was unconscious.

1673
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,320
The police overpowered him.

1674
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,230
- He offered no resistance.
- His gun wouldn't work.

1675
01:19:59,163 --> 01:20:01,244
<i>The Post turned Williams
over to the sheriff.</i>

1676
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,166
- Put the cuffs on them.
- More later.

1677
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:06,880
An anonymous note led to
Williams' capture. Hold on.

1678
01:20:07,328 --> 01:20:09,730
The sheriff's tracing a call
that gave away Williams' hiding place.

1679
01:20:10,011 --> 01:20:11,932
- Where's the old lady?
- She went out.

1680
01:20:12,132 --> 01:20:13,372
Call you back.

1681
01:20:22,379 --> 01:20:25,861
- Give me the warden's office.
- You'll wish you'd never been born.

1682
01:20:26,061 --> 01:20:27,382
Oh, am I?

1683
01:20:27,662 --> 01:20:29,704
- Hello, Fred.
- Well, fine work, Pete.

1684
01:20:29,904 --> 01:20:33,060
- You delivered the goods.
- Looks natural, don't it?

1685
01:20:32,665 --> 01:20:34,707
- Sight for sore eyes.
- Aiding a criminal.

1686
01:20:34,867 --> 01:20:37,269
And a little charge of kidnapping...
What's that?

1687
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:38,629
But that's the jail.

1688
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:41,792
Looks like about ten years apiece
for you two birds.

1689
01:20:41,911 --> 01:20:44,874
<i>When you think you've licked the Post,
it's time to get out.</i>

1690
01:20:45,074 --> 01:20:47,675
Whistling in the dark won't help.
You're through.

1691
01:20:47,755 --> 01:20:51,118
Archie Leach said that to me
a week before he cut his throat.

1692
01:20:51,317 --> 01:20:52,278
Is that so?

1693
01:20:52,559 --> 01:20:55,810
We've been in worse jams than this,
haven't we, Hildy?

1694
01:20:55,641 --> 01:20:58,123
<i>You forget the power
that watches over the Post.</i>

1695
01:20:58,322 --> 01:21:00,644
- It's not with you now.
- Says you.

1696
01:21:00,924 --> 01:21:02,850
I've caught him. Yes, Williams.

1697
01:21:02,646 --> 01:21:05,327
Single-handed.
Proceed with the hanging, per schedule.

1698
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:09,370
- You'll be in office two days more.
- We'll pull your nose out of that feedbag.

1699
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:13,773
I tell you what you'll be doing.
Making brooms in the penitentiary.

1700
01:21:13,973 --> 01:21:15,214
Joe? This is Hartwell.

1701
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:17,055
Come to my office right away.

1702
01:21:17,135 --> 01:21:20,017
I captured some important birds.
Take their confessions.

1703
01:21:20,217 --> 01:21:21,298
Get Liebowitz.

1704
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:25,501
<i>- The lawyers won't help you now.
- You're talking to the Morning Post.</i>

1705
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:26,861
The power of the press?

1706
01:21:28,103 --> 01:21:31,264
Bigger men than you have found out
what the power of the press is.

1707
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:32,505
Presidents, kings...

1708
01:21:32,706 --> 01:21:34,907
- Here's the reprieve.
- Get out.

1709
01:21:35,108 --> 01:21:37,629
- You can't bribe me. My wife...
- Get out.

1710
01:21:37,789 --> 01:21:40,591
- No, I won't. Here's the reprieve.
- What?

1711
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:42,713
I don't want to be a city sealer.

1712
01:21:42,792 --> 01:21:44,354
- Throw him out.
- Out you go.

1713
01:21:44,514 --> 01:21:46,275
Wait.
Who's trying to bribe you?

1714
01:21:46,554 --> 01:21:47,876
- They wouldn't take it.
- Insane!

1715
01:21:48,075 --> 01:21:49,998
What did I say? An unseen power.

1716
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:52,519
What do you mean with a story like that?

1717
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:53,960
He's an impostor.

1718
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,642
Trying to hang an innocent man
to win an election?

1719
01:21:56,842 --> 01:21:57,802
That's murder.

1720
01:21:57,962 --> 01:21:59,884
- I never saw him before.
- If I was to...

1721
01:22:00,004 --> 01:22:01,725
- What's your name?
- Pettibone.

1722
01:22:01,925 --> 01:22:05,100
- When did you deliver this?
- Who'd you talk to?

1723
01:22:04,607 --> 01:22:06,248
- They started to bribe me.
- They?

1724
01:22:06,328 --> 01:22:08,530
- Them.
- It's absurd on the face of it.

1725
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:10,090
He's talking like a child.

1726
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:13,320
- Out of the mouths of babes.
- Hi, babe.

1727
01:22:12,692 --> 01:22:13,813
He's insane or drunk.

1728
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:18,056
If Williams has been reprieved,
I'm tickled to death. Aren't you?

1729
01:22:18,256 --> 01:22:20,177
You'd hang your mother
to be reelected.

1730
01:22:20,378 --> 01:22:22,579
That's a horrible thing to say
about anybody.

1731
01:22:22,659 --> 01:22:24,860
You're marvellous.
Take a look at that.

1732
01:22:25,061 --> 01:22:27,182
- You're an intelligent man.
- Never mind.

1733
01:22:27,382 --> 01:22:29,184
Let's have your story.

1734
01:22:29,383 --> 01:22:31,785
- Nineteen years ago, I married Mrs...
- Skip that.

1735
01:22:31,985 --> 01:22:34,867
She wasn't Mrs. Pettibone then.
She was one of the...

1736
01:22:35,067 --> 01:22:38,700
This document is authentic.
Williams has been reprieved.

1737
01:22:38,629 --> 01:22:41,992
Our commonwealth has been saved
the necessity of shedding blood.

1738
01:22:42,152 --> 01:22:44,954
<i>Get off the soapbox.
Save that for The Tribune.</i>

1739
01:22:45,154 --> 01:22:46,955
Take those handcuffs off my friends.

1740
01:22:47,155 --> 01:22:49,276
- I'm amazed at you.
- Isn't he awful?

1741
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:51,678
You don't know how badly I feel.

1742
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:53,680
No excuse at all for Pete.

1743
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,002
- I was only doing my duty.
- That's all right.

1744
01:22:56,081 --> 01:22:58,700
- What'd you say your name was?
- Pettibone.

1745
01:22:58,603 --> 01:23:00,804
- Here's a picture of my wife.
- Fine woman.

1746
01:23:01,004 --> 01:23:02,926
- You haven't seen her.
- She's all right.

1747
01:23:03,126 --> 01:23:05,808
She's good enough for me.
If I was to tell...

1748
01:23:06,008 --> 01:23:09,900
I understand perfectly, and
as long as I'm mayor...

1749
01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:11,371
Which should be about three hours.

1750
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,173
Enough to get out an edition
asking for your recall.

1751
01:23:14,334 --> 01:23:17,895
And your arrest. You boys
ought to get about ten years apiece.

1752
01:23:18,096 --> 01:23:21,939
Don't make any hasty decisions.
You might run into a libel suit.

1753
01:23:22,018 --> 01:23:26,341
- You'll run into the governor.
- We understand each other perfectly.

1754
01:23:26,542 --> 01:23:28,183
Yes, and so do I.

1755
01:23:28,262 --> 01:23:30,984
So do you what?
And now, Mr. Pettibone...

1756
01:23:31,264 --> 01:23:34,627
...we'll deliver this reprieve
to the warden's office. Come along.

1757
01:23:34,827 --> 01:23:37,709
- If I was to tell my wife...
- You won't have to.

1758
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:41,631
<i>Wait till they read
the Morning Post tomorrow.</i>

1759
01:23:41,832 --> 01:23:42,792
Tight squeeze.

1760
01:23:43,073 --> 01:23:45,274
- Give me Duffy.
- That's our worst jam.

1761
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:46,996
What? Where? Get him.

1762
01:23:47,195 --> 01:23:50,198
Remember stealing old lady Haggerty's
stomach from the coroner?

1763
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,599
Any time you need this guy
he's never there.

1764
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:54,800
We proved she'd been poisoned,
didn't we?

1765
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,882
We had to hide out for a week.
Do you remember that?

1766
01:23:58,043 --> 01:24:01,245
The Shoreland Hotel.
That's how we happened to...

1767
01:24:01,324 --> 01:24:03,860
We could have gone
to jail for that too.

1768
01:24:03,646 --> 01:24:07,200
Yes, maybe you're right, Hildy.
It's a bad business.

1769
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:10,300
You'll be better off.
You better get going.

1770
01:24:09,771 --> 01:24:12,172
- Where would I go?
- To Bruce, of course.

1771
01:24:12,373 --> 01:24:14,974
- You know he's gone. He took a train.
- Send a wire.

1772
01:24:15,174 --> 01:24:17,936
He'll be at the station
when you get into Albany.

1773
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:21,578
- Why doesn't he have a phone?
- I don't know. I got us messed up...

1774
01:24:21,779 --> 01:24:25,061
- Get going, Hildy.
- What is that with you?

1775
01:24:25,341 --> 01:24:27,823
Wait a minute.
Can't you understand?

1776
01:24:28,022 --> 01:24:31,585
I'm trying to do something noble.
Get out before I change my mind.

1777
01:24:31,786 --> 01:24:32,826
It's tough enough now.

1778
01:24:33,106 --> 01:24:35,828
- Just a minute.
- Send him a wire. He'll be waiting.

1779
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:38,789
- Who'll write the story?
- I will. It won't be as good...

1780
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:41,192
It's my story.
I like to think that it...

1781
01:24:41,391 --> 01:24:44,634
- At last.
- I get it. The same old act, isn't it?

1782
01:24:44,834 --> 01:24:47,356
Try to push me out,
thinking I'll want to stay.

1783
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:50,037
I know I deserve that.
Wait a minute, Duffy.

1784
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:52,190
This time you're wrong.

1785
01:24:51,758 --> 01:24:54,921
When you walk out that door,
part of me will go right with you.

1786
01:24:55,121 --> 01:24:57,322
But a whole new world
will open up for you.

1787
01:24:57,522 --> 01:25:00,004
I made fun of Bruce and Albany.
You know why?

1788
01:25:00,204 --> 01:25:01,565
- Why?
- I was jealous.

1789
01:25:01,645 --> 01:25:06,100
I was sore because he could offer you
the kind of life I can't give you.

1790
01:25:05,608 --> 01:25:06,849
That's what you want, honey.

1791
01:25:07,048 --> 01:25:09,050
I could do the story
and take the train...

1792
01:25:09,251 --> 01:25:11,652
Forget it. Come on. Come on.

1793
01:25:11,932 --> 01:25:13,653
Goodbye, dear, and good luck.

1794
01:25:17,616 --> 01:25:20,658
Duffy, now this is how
it goes so far...

1795
01:25:20,858 --> 01:25:22,299
Just a minute.

1796
01:25:23,259 --> 01:25:25,662
Hello. Who? Hildy Johnson?

1797
01:25:25,861 --> 01:25:28,262
- She just left.
- I'm still here. I can take it.

1798
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:29,783
Hang on a minute.

1799
01:25:31,825 --> 01:25:33,546
Hildy Johnson speaking.

1800
01:25:34,506 --> 01:25:36,628
The 4th Precinct police station?

1801
01:25:36,908 --> 01:25:38,069
Put him on.

1802
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:42,392
I thought you were on your
way to Albany... What for?

1803
01:25:42,672 --> 01:25:44,513
For having counterfeit money.

1804
01:25:44,794 --> 01:25:46,034
Counterfeit money?

1805
01:25:46,235 --> 01:25:47,675
Hold on a minute.

1806
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:49,397
Where did you get it?

1807
01:25:49,597 --> 01:25:51,238
I gave it to you?

1808
01:25:51,718 --> 01:25:55,361
All right.
I'll try and do something about it.

1809
01:26:05,728 --> 01:26:07,089
Honey.

1810
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:09,850
Honey, don't cry, please.

1811
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:13,693
I didn't mean to make you cry.
What's wrong? You never cried before.

1812
01:26:15,134 --> 01:26:18,897
I thought you were really
sending me away with Bruce.

1813
01:26:20,338 --> 01:26:22,539
I didn't know you had him locked up.

1814
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:26,182
I thought you were
on the level, for once.

1815
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:29,744
That you were just standing by
and letting me go off with him...

1816
01:26:29,944 --> 01:26:31,945
...and not doing a thing about it.

1817
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:34,747
Come on, honey. What did you
think I was, a chump?

1818
01:26:34,947 --> 01:26:37,028
I thought you didn't love me.

1819
01:26:37,229 --> 01:26:38,790
What were you thinking with?

1820
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:40,231
I don't know.

1821
01:26:41,072 --> 01:26:43,672
What are you standing
there gawking for?

1822
01:26:43,873 --> 01:26:45,995
We have to get him out of jail.

1823
01:26:46,154 --> 01:26:48,396
Send Louie down
with some honest money...

1824
01:26:48,556 --> 01:26:50,318
...and send him back to Albany.

1825
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:51,758
Sure.

1826
01:26:52,318 --> 01:26:56,220
Everything's changed.
We're coming over to the office.

1827
01:26:55,681 --> 01:26:58,283
Don't worry about the story.
Hildy will write it.

1828
01:26:59,230 --> 01:27:00,964
She never intended to quit.
We're getting married.

1829
01:27:01,165 --> 01:27:04,247
- Can we go on a honeymoon this time?
- Sure.

1830
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,289
Duffy, you can be managing editor.

1831
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:10,171
Not permanently.
Just for the two weeks we're away.

1832
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,212
I don't know where.
Where are we going?

1833
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:13,854
Niagara Falls.

1834
01:27:14,134 --> 01:27:16,255
- Niagara Falls.
- Two whole weeks?

1835
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:19,137
Sure, you've earned it. What?

1836
01:27:19,297 --> 01:27:22,379
What? A strike? What strike?

1837
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:24,781
Where? Albany?

1838
01:27:24,981 --> 01:27:28,263
- I know it's on the way, but...
- Okay, we'll honeymoon in Albany.

1839
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:29,784
Okay, Duffy.

1840
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:33,670
Isn't that a coincidence!
I wonder if Bruce can put us up.

1841
01:27:33,626 --> 01:27:35,828
Say, why don't you carry that
in your hand?
