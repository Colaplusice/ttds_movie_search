1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,100


2
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,200
- 'Morning, Mr. Pirovitch.
- Good morning.

3
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:52,030
- Always the first one.
- It's none of your business.

4
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:54,599
Let me tell you,
it doesn't hurt to be too early.

5
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,840
What for and why? Who sees you? Me.
And who sees me? You.

6
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,650
What does it get us?
Can we give each other a raise? No.

7
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:05,510
What are you doing with that bicycle?
You can't take it.

8
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,109
Better not let Mr. Matuschek see.

9
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:09,280
Why don't you tell him?
It's all right with me.

10
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,689
You know where I was last night
while you were home soaking your feet?

11
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,919
Running my legs off for Mrs. Matuschek.

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,360
"Pepi, go to the dressmaker."
And when I come back:

13
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,199
"Pepi, will you please pick up a package
at the drugstore?"

14
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,400
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Kaczek.

15
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:23,159
Good morning.

16
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,370
- How's your boy?
- Much better, thanks.

17
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,710
- We called Dr. Hegedus.
- He's a very expensive doctor.

18
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,110
What can you do?

19
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,669
I thought I'd cut down on my cigars
for a few weeks.

20
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,270
- Good morning.
- Good morning, llona.

21
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:38,110
- That's a new silver fox! It's stunning!
- Thank you.

22
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:40,520
- It must have been pretty expensive.
- It was.

23
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:42,949
I hesitated a long time before I bought it.

24
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,319
I said, "No, I can't afford it."
Still, I couldn't take my eyes off it.

25
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:50,259
- I said, "No, I have no right to..."
- And then he said, "Go on and take it."

26
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,270
- Trying to be clever.
- Shut up.

27
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,030
Good morning.

28
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:56,870
Pepi, go to the drugstore
and get me a bicarbonate of soda.

29
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,669
- What's the matter?
- Do you feel well?

30
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,000
It's all right.

31
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,270
- Good morning, good morning.
- Good morning.

32
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,810
- Want to hear a joke?
- No.

33
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,310
What's the matter, folks?

34
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:11,250
Not awake yet? Look at me.
I bet I haven't slept half as much as you.

35
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,419
Friends, Romans, countrymen,
to tell you the truth...

36
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,789
...I had quite a time last night.

37
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,919
We don't want to hear the poor girl's name.

38
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,590
- Kralik, how was the dinner last night?
- Oh, yes, that's right.

39
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,960
Kralik had dinner with the boss last night.
How was it? Tell us all about it.

40
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,629
- Are you a partner now, Mr. Kralik?
- Don't be funny.

41
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,699
How was it?

42
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,370
It was a very nice evening,
and I enjoyed myself.

43
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,810
- I bet the food was good.
- You can imagine.

44
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,539
Tell me, is it true Mrs. Matuschek
had her face lifted?

45
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,580
How could I know that?

46
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,050
- How old did she look to you last night?
- Well, 40.

47
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,810
She had her face lifted.

48
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:49,789
I think Mrs. Matuschek
is a very charming woman.

49
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,689
- Who said she isn't?
- Don't try to make something out of it.

50
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,729
I didn't say Mrs. Matuschek
is not charming.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,960
But I said she is. What's wrong with that?

52
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:58,400
So the food was good?

53
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:00,629
Seven courses,
not including the hors d'oeuvres.

54
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,830
- Were you sitting next to her?
- I was. What do you think of that?

55
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:06,969
- I bet you were brilliant.
- No, I kept still and tried to learn.

56
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,340
- Your bicarbonate, Mr. Kralik.
- Thanks, Pepi.

57
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:12,280
- Bicarbonate?
- I had a little too much goose liver.

58
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:14,539
What's the matter? Wasn't it any good?

59
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,980
Now, look here, vadas.
Just a minute. Folks, come over.

60
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,949
Did you hear... I want you to hear this.

61
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,550
Did I make any derogatory remark
about the goose liver?

62
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,089
- No, not any!
- Not one word!

63
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,250
I merely said
that I had too much goose liver.

64
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:28,689
- "A little too much goose liver."
- That's right.

65
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:32,430
"A little too much goose liver."
Not one word more, and not one less.

66
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,740
- Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.
- Yes, good morning.

67
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,500
Here.

68
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:46,740
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.

69
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,180
Who put this 32.50 suitcase in the window?

70
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,589
I did, Mr. Matuschek.

71
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,889
- I guess it's all right.
- Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.

72
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,399
- Yeah. Pepi.
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

73
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:12,939
Go across the street to the drugstore,
and get me some bicarbonate of soda.

74
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,069
Yes, sir.

75
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,839
Allow me, Mr. Matuschek. May I help?

76
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,879
There we are, Mr. Matuschek.

77
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,000
- Pirovitch. Want to hear something nice?
- Yes. What is it?

78
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,189
A letter from a girl.

79
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,470
"My heart was trembling as I walked
into the post office...

80
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,740
"...and there you were, lying in box 237.

81
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,379
"I took you out of your envelope
and read you...

82
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,949
"...read you right there...

83
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,279
"...oh, my dear friend."

84
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,810
- What is all this?
- You see, I wanted to buy an encyclopedia.

85
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:05,720
Encyclopedia? What're you talking about?

86
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,160
You come to a time in your life
when you get tired of going to cafs...

87
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,060
...dance halls every night,
and you want to improve yourself.

88
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:14,399
You want to study something about art...

89
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,800
...literature and history,
how people live in Brazil.

90
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:20,399
Tell me what has all this to do
with the letter?

91
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,639
You know I can't afford
a new encyclopedia...

92
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,269
...so I was looking through the ads
in the paper...

93
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,579
...and I got on the wrong page,
and I came across this ad, and...

94
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,120
Wait a minute, I have it right here.
Here, read that.

95
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,449
"Modern girl wishes to correspond
on cultural subjects...

96
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,459
"...anonymously with intelligent,
sympathetic, young man.

97
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,930
"Address: Dear Friend,
Post Office 15, Box 237."

98
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,329
I know those ads.
The papers are full of them.

99
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,459
- How long has this been going on?
- We've exchanged four letters.

100
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,129
- Four letters?
- And she's no ordinary girl.

101
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:56,800
Now listen to this:

102
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,699
"Are you tall? Are you short?

103
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:03,839
"Are your eyes blue? Are they brown?
Don't tell me.

104
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:07,490
"What does it matter
so long as our minds meet?"

105
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,019
- That's beautiful.
- It is, isn't it?

106
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:12,220
Now, wait a minute.

107
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:15,889
"We have enough troubles
in our daily lives.

108
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,120
"There are so many great
and beautiful things...

109
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,220
"...to discuss in this world of ours...

110
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,430
"...it would be wasting precious moments...

111
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,899
"...if we told each other the vulgar details...

112
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,339
"...of how we earn our daily bread,
so don't let's do it."

113
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,470
Mr. Kralik.

114
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,180
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

115
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,509
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

116
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:38,639
I can buy two dozen of
these cigarette boxes at Miklos Brothers.

117
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,279
What do you think of it?
I think it's great. Well, open it.

118
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:48,420
No, Mr. Matuschek, it's not for us.

119
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,470
But you haven't listened to it.
It plays Ochi Tchornya.

120
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:54,759
Even if it played Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony, I'd still say no.

121
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,300
I just don't like the idea.

122
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,699
It's wonderful how you make up
your mind so quickly.

123
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,600
I've been in this business for 35 years.

124
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,639
It took me a whole hour to decide
that I like this box.

125
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:07,009
But, of course, you're a genius.
You know so much more than I.

126
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,709
- Mr. vadas.
- Coming, Mr. Matuschek.

127
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,649
- Miss Novotni.
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek?

128
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,550
Look here, what do you think of this?

129
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,420
I want your honest opinion.
Don't let me influence you.

130
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,019
All I want is your honest opinion.

131
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,930
Well, Miss Novotni?

132
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:33,009
I think people who smoke cigarettes...

133
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,509
...and love to hear Ochi Tchornya
will like it.

134
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,570
I'd even go further.

135
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,269
I think it'll make music lovers
out of smokers...

136
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,110
...and smokers out of music lovers.
It's sensational!

137
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,710
Yes, well.
Mr. Kralik, have you thought it over?

138
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,950
Yes. I still think it's inadvisable.

139
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,350
Well, give me one reason.

140
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,320
Let's say that a man smokes
20 cigarettes a day.

141
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,860
That means that 20 times a day
he opens this box...

142
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:59,529
...and 20 times a day
he has to listen to Ochi Tchornya.

143
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,259
It's a perfectly terrible idea.

144
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,429
It's imitation leather, the glue's no good...

145
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,000
...in two weeks it will fall apart,
and all you'll have is Ochi Tchornya.

146
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,940
You don't have to tell me
that it's imitation leather. I know that.

147
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,240
You sell things and let me do the buying.

148
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,909
- Excuse me, Mr. Matuschek.
- Yes?

149
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,919
Miklos Brothers is calling
about the cigarette box.

150
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,210
Miklos, yes.

151
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,889
Yes, Mr. Miklos.

152
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:27,590
Can I call you back in about five minutes?

153
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:30,220
I'd like a little more time to think about it.

154
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:32,460
No, no, it's not the price.

155
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:35,500
It's just that I'm not quite sure
about the whole idea.

156
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,929
Yes.

157
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,110
Yes, Mr. Miklos.

158
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,059
What?

159
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,480
You can't expect me
to make up my mind in five minutes!

160
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:47,909
If that's the case, then I'll have to say no.

161
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,240
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,120
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning.

163
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,029
- A lovely bag, don't you think?
- Yes, very.

164
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,200
It's an imported model.

165
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:13,539
We have it in pigskin,
several different colors...

166
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,769
...and with or without fitted accessories.

167
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,809
- I really didn't come in to buy a bag.
- I beg your pardon. What can I show you?

168
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:24,409
To tell you the truth,
I really didn't come in to buy anything.

169
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,820
That's perfectly all right.

170
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:28,250
If you wish to look around,
make yourself at home.

171
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,580
Yes, thank you.

172
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:34,789
I wonder if I could see Mr. Matuschek.

173
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:38,029
Unfortunately, Mr. Matuschek is quite busy
at the moment.

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,299
- I could call him if you wanted.
- I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

175
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,539
If you tell me your wishes,
it's possible I could take care of them.

176
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,129
I noticed in your shop window
that you're having a summer sale.

177
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,080
Yes, everything in the shop
is marked down 25 percent...

178
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:58,139
...some articles even more.
Take for instance this compact.

179
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,850
Yesterday you couldn't get it
for a penny less than 3.90. Now it's 2.25.

180
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,149
- Yes, that's a wonderful bargain.
- Everything in the shop is a bargain today.

181
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,919
Yes, I imagine you'll be doing big business.

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,590
I have no doubt of it.
You were very wise to come early.

183
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:14,600
It'll be such a rush,
we won't be able to help the customers.

184
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:18,470
- Maybe you should take on extra help.
- We probably will.

185
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:21,870
Maybe you could use me.
I'm looking for a job.

186
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,649
That wasn't very nice,
letting me go through the whole routine.

187
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,149
I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to.
Could you help me get a job here?

188
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,809
I'd like to, but there's no opening.

189
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:38,289
But you just told me you'd need some
extra people because of the rush.

190
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,730
Look around for yourself.

191
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,200
You can see
what kind of business we're doing.

192
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,799
I beg your pardon.

193
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:46,399
Yes, madam?

194
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,559
How much is that belt in the window,
the one that says 2.95?

195
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,700
- 2.95.
- Oh, no.

196
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:59,110
- May I tell you my qualifications?
- Lf I could do anything for you, I'd do it.

197
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,409
I'm not inexperienced.

198
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,419
I know the situation, and there's no chance.

199
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,639
I worked for two years
at Blasek and Company...

200
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,580
...and 10 months at Latzki Brothers.

201
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:09,019
Even if you'd worked at Mintz and Kramer...

202
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,120
I did! I took care of the finest clientele.

203
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,129
We don't deal with that class here.
We have middle-class trade.

204
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,629
What trade do you think they have?

205
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,960
They'd take me back now.

206
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:19,330
- Why don't you go back?
- That's another story.

207
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,340
If it was up to me, I'd put you to work.
But I'm not the boss.

208
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,799
- Then why don't you let me see him?
- He's in sort of a bad mood today.

209
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,899
I'll take a chance.
Maybe I can cheer him up.

210
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,210
Young lady, I've been here for nine years,
and I know Mr. Matuschek inside out.

211
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,210
I can predict his every reaction.

212
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,809
I could tell you word for word
exactly what he'd say.

213
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,789
Mr. Kralik, I beg your pardon.

214
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:41,789
Just one moment, please.

215
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:43,480
It's all right.

216
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:47,629
So, you know every reaction of mine?

217
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,750
You know me inside out?

218
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:52,759
You know what I think,
even before I thought of it.

219
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:55,700
You're not only a genius,
you're a mind reader.

220
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:57,759
- Mr. Matuschek...
- Never mind.

221
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,669
Good morning, madam.
I am Mr. Matuschek.

222
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:04,940
- Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.
- Here, please, sit down.

223
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,970
I don't know what the difficulty is...

224
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,580
...but I can assure you,
that the word "impossible"...

225
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:13,210
...is not in the vocabulary
of Matuschek and Company.

226
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,620
- I am so happy to hear you say that.
- I mean it.

227
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,620
- Mr. Matuschek.
- Yes, madam?

228
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:19,289
I was at Blasek and Company...

229
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,519
Oh, madam. I'm sure you'll find
much nicer things in my shop.

230
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,789
No, I mean, I worked there.
I'm looking for a job.

231
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:28,429
No, no, that's impossible.
It's out of the question.

232
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,129
- But...
- I have no time. I'm very busy.

233
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:35,639
I'm very sorry.
I'm afraid you're just wasting your time.

234
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,470
But I've got to have a job.

235
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,100
- Mr. Kralik.
- Just a moment, Mr. Matuschek.

236
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:43,620
- Have you tried Baum's Department Store?
- Every entrance.

237
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,049
I don't know what to tell you.
Maybe after inventory.

238
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,559
- When will that be?
- In a week or so.

239
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:52,149
- Kralik!
- Just a minute, Mr. Matuschek.

240
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,889
Please, may I leave my address?

241
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,789
If we need anybody, you'll be the first.

242
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,730
My name is Klara Novak, Duna Street, 42.

243
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:00,320
And if you need me in a hurry,
you can phone 246-422.

244
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,929
It's the grocery store downstairs.

245
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,870
Ask for Johanna,
and tell her you have a message for Klara.

246
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,600
"Business message for Klara."
Yes, I have that.

247
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:10,139
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek?
- Close the door.

248
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:18,080
Why did you put me in that situation
in front of the whole shop?

249
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,279
I'm very sorry, sir, but it was not my fault.

250
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:23,480
- Whose fault was it? Mine?
- Yes.

251
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,120
What's the matter with you, Kralik?
You're my oldest employee.

252
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,690
I do everything I can
to show my appreciation.

253
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,899
I ask you to my house.

254
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,269
- I'm very grateful, sir.
- You have a funny way of showing it.

255
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,629
You know how much
I value your judgment...

256
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,710
...and on every occasion you contradict me.

257
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:41,470
Whatever I say, you say, "no."

258
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:45,269
From now on, I say, "yes."
Yes, Mr. Matuschek. Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

259
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,750
Certainly, Mr. Matuschek.
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

260
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,980
- That was a nice party last night.
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

261
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,590
- Yes, I had a lot of fun, didn't you?
- Yes.

262
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:00,159
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself so much.

263
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:03,490
That little poem that you wrote
in Mrs. Matuschek's guest book...

264
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:05,429
...did you make that up yourself?

265
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,399
It's sort of half and half.

266
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,870
- How do you mean?
- Half Shakespeare and half me.

267
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,230
I just changed the lines around
to suit the occasion.

268
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,240
I made that last line rhyme
with Matuschek, that's all.

269
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:21,179
- Mrs. Matuschek liked it very much.
- Thank you.

270
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,279
You made a fine impression on her.

271
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,220
Mrs. Matuschek thinks a lot of you.

272
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,519
And you know,
I think a lot of Mrs. Matuschek.

273
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:36,149
- Mr. Matuschek?
- Yes?

274
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,669
I've found a customer for the cigarette box.
What price shall I quote?

275
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,389
Well, let me see.

276
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:45,159
It costs us 2.85,
and I think we get five percent...

277
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,870
Let me take care of this, Mr. Matuschek.

278
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:54,110
Look, there's no use waiting now.
Believe me.

279
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:56,169
If there's an opening, you'll be the first.

280
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,649
Just a moment.
Tell me, would you buy a box like this?

281
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:03,549
Mr. Matuschek,
I couldn't buy anything at the moment.

282
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:07,019
No, I want your opinion.
Your honest opinion.

283
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,220
Now, don't let me influence you.
I just want your opinion.

284
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,000
Do you like this box?

285
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,700
Yes, I do. I think it's lovely.

286
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,299
Yes. Why?

287
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:18,570
Why?

288
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:21,659
I think it's romantic.

289
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:23,570
What's romantic about it?

290
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:29,980
Well, cigarettes and music, I don't know.

291
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,580
It makes me think of moonlight and...

292
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,409
...cigarettes and music.

293
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,429
- There's the woman's point of view.
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

294
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,759
- Mr. Matuschek.
- Yes, Miss...

295
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:43,860
Novak.

296
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,370
- How much are you selling it for?
- Let me see. 4.25.

297
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,000
4.25?

298
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,529
Yes, 4.25.

299
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:54,809
That's a bargain! That's a real bargain!

300
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:03,309
Good morning, madam.
It's a lovely box, isn't it?

301
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:07,680
Oh, yes. It's a candy box, isn't it?

302
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:12,690
Yes, madam, a candy box,
and I should say, a very unusual one.

303
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,559
May I open it for you?

304
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:20,789
Yes, madam. That's Ochi Tchornya.
It's a very popular classic.

305
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,569
No, that would never do.
Where do people get ideas like that?

306
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,309
Imagine, every time you take
a piece of candy...

307
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,430
...you have to listen to that song.
I couldn't buy a thing like that. Too silly.

308
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:33,940
I know just what you mean, madam.

309
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:37,509
Yet some customers like it
for the very thing you object to.

310
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:39,049
We've sold quite a few.

311
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,450
- Really?
- Yes, madam.

312
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,089
There's no denying that we all have
a weakness for candy.

313
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:46,990
I don't mean to say anything
against candy.

314
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,720
No, I only mean that sometimes
we are inclined to overdo it a little.

315
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,089
I suppose so.

316
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,400
Madam, have you any idea
how many pieces of candy you eat a day?

317
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,170
No, I never gave it a thought.

318
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,500
We pick up a piece of candy
absent-mindedly...

319
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:02,059
...and then we take another piece.

320
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,299
Before we know it,
we've gained a few pounds.

321
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,250
That's when our troubles begin.
Massages, electric cabinets.

322
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:08,279
I know it.

323
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,150
Now, this little box makes you
candy-conscious.

324
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,349
That's what we designed it for.

325
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,890
Every time you open it,
the little tinkling song is a message to you.

326
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:20,519
"Too much candy, now be careful."

327
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,089
How much is it?

328
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:27,359
It's 5.50, reduced from 6.95.
It's a real bargain.

329
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,769
- I'll take it.
- Thank you, madam.

330
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,069
What do you say now?

331
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,970
I think people who like to smoke candy
and listen to cigarettes will love it.

332
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,710
Don't let me influence you.

333
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:45,839
I want your opinion, your honest opinion,
that's all I want.

334
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,420
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

335
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,170
- 'Morning.
- Good morning, Kralik.

336
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,079
I've got a big dinner date tonight.

337
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,910
- With the boss?
- No, he never invites me anymore.

338
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:17,450
How do you figure him out, anyway?

339
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:21,250
I give up. It's certainly very difficult
to get along with him these days.

340
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,910
He never talks to me anymore.

341
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,150
I hope he's feeling more cheerful today.

342
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:28,819
He better,
because I'm going to ask him for a raise.

343
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:30,319
A raise?

344
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,930
Do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?

345
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,059
- No, go ahead.
- It's confidential.

346
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,130
Yes, sure.

347
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,930
Suppose that a fellow like me
wants to get married.

348
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,140
That's wonderful! That's the best thing
that could happen. Who's the girl?

349
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,680
Wait a minute.
What did I say? I said, "suppose."

350
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,910
I said, "a fellow like me." I didn't say me.

351
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,210
How much does it cost you to live,
you and Mrs. Pirovitch?

352
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:54,980
- Leaving out the children.
- Why fool yourself?

353
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,789
Well, let's say temporarily.
How much does it cost?

354
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,960
- It can be done.
- Yeah?

355
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:07,019
Yes, and very nicely.
Naturally, you can't be extravagant.

356
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,500
Suppose a fellow gets
an apartment with three rooms.

357
00:20:09,569 --> 00:20:11,000
Dining room, bedroom, living room.

358
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:14,230
What do you need three rooms for?
You live in the bedroom.

359
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:17,569
- Where do you eat?
- In the kitchen. You get a nice big kitchen.

360
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,079
Where do you entertain?

361
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,269
What are you, an ambassador?
Who do you want to entertain?

362
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:25,880
If someone is really your friend,
he comes after dinner.

363
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:27,710
Oh, no.

364
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:30,759
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Novak.

365
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:33,190
- How's your wife, Mr. Pirovitch?
- Oh, my goodness!

366
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:35,059
I forgot to call Dr. Hegedus.

367
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,160
- Something serious with your wife?
- No, she couldn't be better.

368
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,890
- Why do you want to call him?
- Lf I don't, he'll come.

369
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,930
Excuse me, I'd better telephone him.
I hope it isn't too late.

370
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:55,980
Miss Novak?

371
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,509
Yes, Mr. Kralik?

372
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,380
I noticed that you wore a yellow blouse
with light-green dots yesterday.

373
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,680
No, Mr. Kralik. As usual, you're mistaken.
It was green with light-yellow dots.

374
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:07,920
Everybody else thought
it was very becoming.

375
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,150
I don't remember remarking
about your neckties.

376
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,460
If you think I couldn't say anything
about your neckties...

377
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:16,470
...just ask Mr. vadas.
My blouse is none of your business.

378
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:19,400
I'm sorry. Mr. Matuschek seems
to think it is my business.

379
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:21,769
Yes, that's right. I'm working under you.

380
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,140
I'll call you every morning
and describe what I'm going to wear.

381
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,809
Before I select my next wardrobe,
my dressmaker will give you samples.

382
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,609
- Imagine you dictating what I should wear.
- I don't care what you wear.

383
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,349
For a circus pony, it's all right.

384
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,410
I have my own troubles
without your blouse...

385
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,720
...between Matuschek and me.

386
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:39,779
I sold as much yesterday as anybody else.

387
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:42,890
For a rainy Monday three weeks
before Christmas, 95.50 isn't bad.

388
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,589
- Did you tell Mr. Matuschek that?
- Yes.

389
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,430
And what did he say?

390
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,690
"Not to come in that blouse."

391
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:48,789
- Tell him I won't.
- I will!

392
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,170
Good morning.

393
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:58,170
I caught him in time. Saves me five pengo,
and that counts when you're married.

394
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:00,970
- Is this tie all right to wear to work?
- Quite all right.

395
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:02,549
Tell me, who is the girl?

396
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:05,279
Well, you know that girl
I was corresponding with?

397
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:08,119
- Yes, about the cultural subjects.
- Yeah.

398
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,619
Well, after a while,
we got on the subject of love...

399
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,750
...naturally on a very cultural level.

400
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:14,450
What else can you do in a letter?

401
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:16,789
She is the most wonderful girl
in the world.

402
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,329
Is she pretty?

403
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,529
She has such ideals
and such a viewpoint on things...

404
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:25,299
...that she's so far above the girls
you meet today, there's no comparison.

405
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,170
- So she is not so very pretty?
- Don't say that.

406
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:30,869
I'm sorry.
The main thing is that you like her.

407
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:33,000
- Yeah, I hope I will.
- What do you mean?

408
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:36,140
You love a girl,
and you don't know if you like her?

409
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:39,180
Well, that's just the question.
I haven't met her yet.

410
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,339
- What? You haven't met her yet?
- No.

411
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,619
I keep postponing it and postponing it.

412
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,619
I'm scared.

413
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,359
This girl thinks I'm the most
wonderful person in the world.

414
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:52,519
And after all, there is a chance
she might be disappointed.

415
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,170
Yes, there is a chance.

416
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,789
- On the other hand...
- You might be disappointed, too.

417
00:22:56,869 --> 00:22:58,670
And I don't dare think about it.

418
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:03,529
Pirovitch, did you ever get a bonus?

419
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,009
Yes, once.

420
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:10,140
Yeah, the boss hands you the envelope.

421
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:13,410
You wonder how much is in it,
and you don't want to open it.

422
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:16,910
As long as the envelope's closed,
you're a millionaire.

423
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,579
You keep postponing that moment and...

424
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:23,420
...you can't postpone it forever.

425
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:26,329
I'm meeting her tonight, 8:30 in a caf.

426
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,190
- A red carnation?
- Yeah.

427
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,529
Yeah.

428
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:33,470
She's using one for a bookmark
in a copy of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.

429
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:35,230
I'm wearing one in my lapel.

430
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:37,240
I haven't slept for days.

431
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,039
I'm sure she'll be beautiful.

432
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,150
Not too beautiful.
What chance would a fellow like me...

433
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,410
- What do you want, a homely girl?
- No.

434
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,309
You knock on wood for me.

435
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,319
Just a lovely, average girl.

436
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,359
That's all I want.

437
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:02,759
Thank you, my good man.

438
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,269
'Morning, everybody.

439
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,079
Here, keep the change.
Send your boy through college.

440
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,130
Thank you, sir.

441
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,349
I see by the expression
on your underpaid faces...

442
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,710
...you wonder where I get money.

443
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:19,579
No, Mr. vadas, I don't wonder.

444
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,019
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I don't wonder.

445
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:32,359
Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.

446
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,269
This window looks terrible.

447
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,369
There isn't a shop on the street
that doesn't look better.

448
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,269
It's a wonder we get any customers.

449
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:46,279
We'll stay tonight after closing hours
and redecorate it.

450
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,880
- I'll have to get out of it some way.
- Klara, you haven't got a chance.

451
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,440
I have an engagement tonight at 8:30.
I have to go home first. I have to change.

452
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,480
Ilona, did you notice the blouse
I wore yesterday, the green one?

453
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,720
With the light yellow dots?
I thought it was simply stunning.

454
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,230
I'm so glad.
I'm planning to wear it tonight.

455
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:11,160
Hello? Yeah, hello, darling.

456
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:15,799
Well, you were sleeping,
and I didn't want to disturb you.

457
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,670
You came home late last night.

458
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:20,470
I thought perhaps
you'd like to sleep a little longer.

459
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,809
No, I'm not angry.
Did you have a good time?

460
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,380
That's all that matters, isn't it?

461
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,210
What?

462
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:33,390
1,000 pengo?

463
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,190
But, Emma, I don't understand it.
Only last Monday I gave you...

464
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:42,829
No, I'm not complaining.
It's quite a bit of money.

465
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,569
Yeah, all right.
I'll send it over as soon as possible.

466
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:49,539
Yeah, goodbye.

467
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,670
Come in.

468
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,119
- What is it?
- I'd like to talk to you for a moment.

469
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,019
- Is it important?
- It's important to me.

470
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,529
Is it important
to Matuschek and Company?

471
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,990
Not exactly, sir.

472
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,289
Well, then, I'm sorry. I'm busy.
You'll have to see me later.

473
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,869
- Pardon me, sir.
- What is it now?

474
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,910
Sir, for several days your attitude
toward me seems to have changed.

475
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,809
- Has it?
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek, it has.

476
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,750
Really, I'm completely at a loss
to understand it.

477
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:35,450
After all, I do my work.

478
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,089
And you get paid for it?

479
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,019
Yes, sir.

480
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,960
- Every month?
- Yes, sir.

481
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,319
Yes, everything seems to be all right then,
doesn't it?

482
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:45,599
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

483
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,869
Did you see him?

484
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,200
I'm not going
to stand for this much longer.

485
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,440
What does that man want of me?
Why does he always pick on me?

486
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:02,910
- You are his oldest employee.
- That's a fine reason.

487
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,779
He picks on me, too.
The other day he called me an idiot.

488
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:09,509
What could I do?
I said, "Yes, Mr. Matuschek, I'm an idiot."

489
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,819
I'm no fool.

490
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,420
Listen, maybe he has business worries.

491
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,430
Or maybe he has some trouble
with his wife.

492
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,460
Is that true, Pirovitch?
Is he having trouble with his wife?

493
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:22,869
I don't know, it's none of my business.

494
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,059
I'm talking to Kralik. What do you want?
I don't know anything. Leave me alone.

495
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,410
Kralik, don't be impulsive,
not at a time like this.

496
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,039
Not when millions of people
are out of work.

497
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,440
- I can get a job anywhere.
- Can you? Let's be honest.

498
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:39,779
I'll take a chance. I'm no coward, you know.
I'm not afraid.

499
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,440
- I am. I have a family.
- Well, I haven't.

500
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,559
Think it over.

501
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:47,880
Those were nice letters, weren't they?

502
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:02,210
It's already been paid for.
Leave it downstairs at the desk.

503
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,970
Mr. Kralik, do you think I'll have
to work tonight? After all, I'm a child.

504
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:08,210
- No, you don't have to stay.
- Do you mean it?

505
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:10,940
- I'll straighten it out.
- Thanks, Mr. Kralik!

506
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:21,019
- May I help you?
- No, thank you.

507
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,599
I put all the imported bags over there
on the shelf. Is that how you wanted it?

508
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,960
I'd appreciate it if you'd tell me
if there's anything wrong.

509
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:31,559
Since when have you become interested
in my opinions?

510
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,569
I want to please you, Mr. Kralik.
I'm working under you.

511
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,640
- You don't have to keep harping on that.
- No, I didn't mean it that way at all.

512
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,299
Regardless of what I think of you...

513
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,609
...I believe that anybody
who works with you...

514
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,950
...and doesn't get a great deal out of it,
is just plain dumb.

515
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,190
Just what do you mean?
What do you think of me personally?

516
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:53,660
I mean, since you ask...

517
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,160
...no matter what anybody else says,
I think you're a gentleman.

518
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,829
I try to be.

519
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:03,589
You have no idea
what that means to a working girl.

520
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,700
What a girl goes through in some shops.

521
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:08,539
Take for instance
when I was with Foeldes Brothers & Sons.

522
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:11,670
The sons were all right,
but the brothers, Mr. Kralik...

523
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,339
That's why I like it here so much.

524
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:17,250
When you say, "Miss Novak, let's go
in the back to put bags on the shelf"...

525
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:19,509
...you really want
to put some bags on the shelf.

526
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:21,549
And that's my idea of gentleman.

527
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,220
I just don't believe
in mixing bags with pleasure.

528
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,950
Mr. Kralik.

529
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,160
- Yes, Miss Novak?
- About that blouse...

530
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:36,000
- I'm sorry, but I had to do that.
- I want to thank you. I'm glad you did it.

531
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:38,970
After thinking it all over, you're so right.

532
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,269
- That blouse was awful.
- Oh, no, not awful.

533
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:45,069
It was. I wouldn't admit it at the time,
but what woman would?

534
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,200
We hate to admit we are wrong.
That's why we are so feminine.

535
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,410
This is the first time
you've shown a little sense.

536
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:56,079
- Quite a change in you, Miss Novak.
- I know it, Mr. Kralik.

537
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,950
If you keep this up,
we'll get along much better.

538
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:02,519
- Thank you, Mr. Kralik.
- That's quite all right, Miss Novak.

539
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,859
I was planning to wear
that awful blouse tonight.

540
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,660
- I have a date with...
- Tonight?

541
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,130
Didn't you hear what Mr. Matuschek said?

542
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:12,029
We have to stay
and decorate the windows.

543
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:14,039
- I almost forgot.
- Yes.

544
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,309
Would it be possible,
do you think you could spare me tonight?

545
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,940
And then maybe Mr. Matuschek
would let me off.

546
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,480
So that's why I'm a gentleman.
That's why you've learned from me now?

547
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:29,549
- I don't understand.
- You want the night off?

548
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,779
- I have to, Mr. Kralik.
- You're out of luck.

549
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,859
That was such an obvious trick.
I almost fell for it, too.

550
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:37,789
I have to get off tonight.
It's terribly important.

551
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,589
For the last six months,
you've just antagonized me and...

552
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,029
You haven't been very nice to me either.

553
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,470
Whatever I do, it's wrong.

554
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:46,440
If I wrap a package, it's not right.

555
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:49,170
If I make a suggestion,
and some of them are very good...

556
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,440
- Here.
...you don't listen.

557
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:54,069
Everything has to be done exactly
your way, and then you don't like it.

558
00:30:54,349 --> 00:30:57,609
When I first came into this shop,
I was full of life and enthusiasm...

559
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,089
...and now I'm nothing.
You've taken my personality away.

560
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,380
You're a dictator, that's what you are.

561
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,220
Mr. Kralik, any day now
I may be in a position...

562
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:10,160
...where I don't have to work anymore.
Then I'll really tell you what I think.

563
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:14,059
As for that blouse, I think it's beautiful,
and I'm going to wear it tonight.

564
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,930
Mr. Kralik, I don't like you.

565
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:20,930
Mr. Matuschek,
may I speak to you for a moment?

566
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,009
What is it?

567
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,569
Do you think you could spare me tonight?

568
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,269
Let me see, we need three people,
to dress the "A" window.

569
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,109
- Mr. Kralik?
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

570
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,950
Can you get along
without Miss Novak tonight?

571
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,619
Mr. Matuschek,
I'd like to talk to you for a moment.

572
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:40,779
- You want to go, too?
- Yes, I'd appreciate it very much...

573
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,890
What is this? Does everybody want
to leave? Is this the interest you show?

574
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:48,900
- Once a year, I ask you to stay.
- I'm sorry, if I'd only known yesterday.

575
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,170
You want a special invitation. Next time,
I'll send you an engraved announcement.

576
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:58,309
I have talked everything over
with Mr. Kralik. I know his ideas.

577
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,009
Miss Novotni and I can manage
the novelty window by ourselves.

578
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,950
Did I ask you for your advice?

579
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,279
What do you mean you talked this over?
Who's shop is this?

580
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,460
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

581
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,450
So you want the evening off, Mr. Kralik?

582
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:14,890
That's all right. I think we can manage.

583
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:18,160
This is the first time in years
I have asked a favor.

584
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:20,359
I gave you the evening.
What more do you want?

585
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,029
- Do you want a brass band?
- You're being unjust.

586
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,470
I'm being unjust?

587
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:27,039
Once a year,
I ask six ladies and gentlemen...

588
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,130
...six, mind you, when next door,
a shop twice as big as mine...

589
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,609
...employs only four.

590
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,910
Good morning, madam.
Is there something I can show you?

591
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:37,450
Have you any traveling bags for men
with a zipper?

592
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:40,420
We have all types
of traveling bags for men with zippers.

593
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:44,009
Thank you very much. I'm doing some
window-shopping for my husband.

594
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,349
- He'll be here tomorrow.
- I'll be delighted to serve him, madam.

595
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:50,500
- Thank you. Good morning.
- Good morning, madam.

596
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:56,329
Six people who stand around here
for days telling jokes...

597
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,730
...and talking about the movies,
while I pay the gas and the rent...

598
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:02,400
...and the light, and the taxes,
and their salaries.

599
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,609
Good morning, Matuschek and Company.

600
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:07,839
What?

601
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:10,140
Just a moment.

602
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:12,180
Mr. Pirovitch.

603
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:20,119
Yes? Mama, I called you.

604
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,960
We are decorating the window
after closing hours...

605
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:26,619
...so we won't have to have dinner
with the Laszlos. Isn't that wonderful?

606
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,130
Yes, I knew you'd be glad.
Goodbye, Mama.

607
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,700
Six people I ask, one day a year,
to be so kind...

608
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,500
...as to redecorate a window.

609
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,680
And you have the nerve, Mr. Kralik...

610
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:42,910
...the oldest employee in the place,
who should set an example.

611
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:45,880
You spoke like this to me yesterday.
What did I do then?

612
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:49,609
The whole week you've treated me
like this, and without any reason.

613
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,559
Without any reason?

614
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,519
Maybe I have more reason than you think.

615
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,359
It's obvious
that you're not satisfied with me.

616
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,500
You can draw your own conclusions.

617
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,200
In that case,
I think there's just one thing to do.

618
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:07,660
Perhaps we'd better call it a day.

619
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,539
Matuschek and Company.
Yes, Mrs. Matuschek, he's here.

620
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,409
Mrs. Matuschek on the telephone.

621
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:17,840
Hello, Emma.

622
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:20,820
No, I'm not coming home tonight.

623
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,010
All right.

624
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:26,119
All right, I'll send it right over.

625
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:32,530
Put 1,000 pengo in an envelope
and have Pepi take it to Mrs. Matuschek.

626
00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:36,829
Pepi is out. He has quite a few deliveries,
and he won't be back until after lunch.

627
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:40,039
Mr. Kralik and I always have lunch
at Farago's.

628
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:45,039
It's only a few blocks from your home.
We can deliver it. Right, Mr. Kralik?

629
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,030
Yes.

630
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:48,940
No, thank you, Mr. Kralik.

631
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,210
Mr. vadas.

632
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,309
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

633
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:58,880
I don't like to break in on your lunch hour.

634
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:01,320
It's perfectly all right. It'll be a pleasure.

635
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,860
Thank you, Mr. vadas.

636
00:35:29,889 --> 00:35:31,190
Mr. Kralik...

637
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:34,489
...will you come to my office.
I'd like to talk to you.

638
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,679
Yes, sir.

639
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:51,570
Yes, sir.

640
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:53,739
Mr. Kralik...

641
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:57,340
...l've been thinking all day
about what you said this morning.

642
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:00,349
I'm sorry, Mr. Matuschek.
I'm afraid I lost my temper.

643
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:02,989
No, I think you were right.

644
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,519
I really believe that you'd be happier
somewhere else.

645
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,800
Do you think so, sir?

646
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,190
Yes, I'm sure of it.

647
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,699
I guess there's nothing more to be said.

648
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:29,599
No. Let me see.

649
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,820
You're naturally entitled to a month's pay.

650
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,650
That's 200 pengo.

651
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:36,889
- That's right, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

652
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:40,880
Will you, please, sign this receipt.

653
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,190
And here's a letter...

654
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,130
...which certainly won't handicap you
in seeking employment.

655
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,670
Thank you, sir.

656
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:00,739
I guess we might as well say goodbye.

657
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:04,079
- Goodbye, Mr. Matuschek.
- Goodbye.

658
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,719
Well?

659
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:27,170
What happened?

660
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:40,880
"To whom it may concern:

661
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:47,119
"I wish to state that Mr. Alfred Kralik
leaves my employ of his own accord.

662
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,900
"Mr. Kralik started with Matuschek and
Company nine years ago as an apprentice.

663
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,940
"With diligence,
he advanced to the position of clerk.

664
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:03,710
"For the last five years,
he has been our first salesman.

665
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:09,539
"We have found him reliable,
efficient, resourceful.

666
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:13,250
"We can recommend him without reserve.

667
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,090
"He carries with him our best wishes
for his success in his future career.

668
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,559
"Hugo Matuschek."

669
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:51,280
Kralik, I still can't believe it.
There's no reason.

670
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,090
The boss doesn't have to give you a reason.

671
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,789
That's one of the wonderful things
about being boss.

672
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:00,969
Well, I wanted to get off tonight.

673
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,199
I got off all right.

674
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,199
- Kralik, you're not going?
- No, I couldn't face her tonight.

675
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:12,039
This morning I had a position, a future.

676
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,610
I'm afraid I sort of exaggerated
in my letters.

677
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,019
I showed off a little, and she's expecting
to meet a pretty important man.

678
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,250
I'm in no mood to act important tonight.

679
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,000
Well, I...

680
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,369
My dear Kralik, I think I speak for all of us,
when I say this is a shock and a surprise.

681
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,460
We all feel we are losing
a splendid fellow worker...

682
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:17,369
...and we certainly wish you the luck
which you so rightfully deserve.

683
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:23,880
Now, Kralik,
we are going to see each other soon.

684
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,250
If you have an evening with nothing to do,
you know where we live.

685
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,309
- All right, Pirovitch. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Kralik.

686
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:38,059
Ilona, I'm going to miss you.

687
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:41,059
I don't understand.

688
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:45,429
It's nothing unusual. It happens every day.
Somebody gets fired and...

689
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:49,010
- Goodbye, llona.
- Goodbye, Mr. Kralik.

690
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,000
Flora.

691
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:55,880
Flora, you'll notice
when you look through my sales book...

692
00:40:55,949 --> 00:40:59,440
...I cancelled slip number five,
but I deducted it from the total.

693
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,179
Goodbye.

694
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:13,420
If I had anything to do with you
not getting the evening off, I'm sorry.

695
00:41:13,769 --> 00:41:17,699
It's my fault that you got into this trouble.
Believe me, I'm sorry, too.

696
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:18,760
That's all right.

697
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,699
- It's true we didn't get along.
- No.

698
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,900
I guess we fought a lot,
but losing a job at a time like this...

699
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,840
...is something you don't wish...
- On your worst enemy.

700
00:41:26,909 --> 00:41:30,510
- I didn't say that, Mr. Kralik.
- Let's not quarrel anymore.

701
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:33,849
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Kralik.

702
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:49,829
Yes?

703
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,789
Well?

704
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:56,360
Oh, you have.

705
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,039
How soon can you come over here?

706
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,739
Yes, well, come right away. I'll... Right.

707
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,969
I'll be waiting here.

708
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,420
You may all go home.
We'll finish the windows tomorrow.

709
00:42:39,889 --> 00:42:42,320
- Excuse me. Good night.
- Good night.

710
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,670
Hello. Is this Mrs. Hojas?

711
00:43:07,409 --> 00:43:10,179
This is Mr. Pirovitch, Mr. Kralik's friend.

712
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:15,179
Yes, I know he isn't there yet.
Will you, please, tell him when he comes...

713
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,119
...that we are not working tonight,
and I am coming over.

714
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,090
Yes. Thank you.

715
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,190
I hope you don't mind, Mr. Matuschek.

716
00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:29,929
He probably feels pretty low tonight,
and I thought...

717
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,230
You don't have to explain. What you do
after working hours is your own business.

718
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:35,570
Thank you, sir.

719
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,110
You haven't changed your mind,
by any chance, Mr. Matuschek?

720
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:43,880
You've got the evening off, haven't you?
Well, go home.

721
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:47,679
He is the best man you had.
Why did you let him go?

722
00:43:47,889 --> 00:43:49,409
I warn you, Mr. Pirovitch.

723
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:53,190
His whole life he lived in this shop.
He was almost like a son to you.

724
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,860
And you were so proud of him.

725
00:43:55,929 --> 00:43:58,519
You invited him to your home
again and again.

726
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:01,190
Mr. Pirovitch, you want to keep your job,
don't you?

727
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,829
Yes, Mr. Matuschek. I have a family.

728
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:06,730
Two children.

729
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,969
In that case,
mind your own business and go home.

730
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,880
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

731
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:20,909
- Good night.
- Good night.

732
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:22,110
Good night.

733
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:29,530
- Good night, Mr. Matuschek.
- Good night, vadas.

734
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,360
I beg your pardon.

735
00:44:31,429 --> 00:44:34,559
I'm not quite certain
if I delivered Mrs. Matuschek's message.

736
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:39,500
She told me to remind you to call her
if you don't work tonight.

737
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:41,329
Yes, you told me, vadas.

738
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:47,969
Mr. Matuschek, the last time I had
the pleasure to be at your apartment...

739
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:51,409
...was several months ago
when you sent me after your briefcase.

740
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,920
Today I had a chance to get a glimpse
of your new dining room set.

741
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:57,210
It's exquisite, really.

742
00:44:57,289 --> 00:45:01,230
I can imagine what it'll look like
with all the lights on at a dinner party.

743
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:04,989
- It must be simply stunning.
- Thank you, vadas.

744
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:07,530
- Good night, Mr. Matuschek.
- Good night, vadas.

745
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,710
- Good evening, Mr. Matuschek.
- Good evening.

746
00:45:54,409 --> 00:45:55,469
Please.

747
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,719
- So it's true?
- I'm afraid so, Mr. Matuschek.

748
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:05,179
Here we have a complete record
from our operatives...

749
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,849
...two of our most reliable men.

750
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,530
"Report on Mrs. Emma Matuschek.

751
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:13,590
"On December 6, Mrs. Matuschek
left her residence on vales Street, 23...

752
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,329
"...at 8:45 p.m.

753
00:46:15,769 --> 00:46:19,329
"She walked two blocks up
to Karto Street where she engaged a taxi.

754
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,900
"At 9:03, the taxi stopped at the corner
of Trantor and Bralter Streets.

755
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,469
"There, Mrs. Matuschek was joined
by a young man."

756
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:29,869
Mr. Matuschek, your suspicion was right.
It was one of your employees.

757
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:33,349
Both our operatives identified him later
as Mr. vadas.

758
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,039
- vadas?
- Yes.

759
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,920
Ferencz vadas. Danube Place, 56.

760
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,159
There is such a man in your employ,
isn't there?

761
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,130
Yes, yes.

762
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,869
Twenty-two years we've been married.

763
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,909
Twenty-two years I was proud of my wife.

764
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,510
Well, she...

765
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:09,480
...just didn't want to grow old with me.

766
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,789
If you'll send me your bill,
I'll take care of it immediately.

767
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,619
Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.

768
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:18,719
- Good night.
- Good night.

769
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,489
Good evening.

770
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:55,699
Hello?

771
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,099
No, Mrs. Matuschek.
This is Miss Kaczek speaking.

772
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:01,960
Good evening. Who?

773
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,139
Pepi? No, Pepi isn't back yet.

774
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,110
I see, Mrs. Matuschek.
He did some errands for you.

775
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,050
Oh, you don't say!

776
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,150
He forgot to pick up a bottle of perfume
at Chabot's?

777
00:48:15,289 --> 00:48:16,650
Isn't that too bad!

778
00:48:16,889 --> 00:48:20,019
Yes, I'll give a good scolding
to the little rascal.

779
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:22,889
Have a good time, Mrs. Matuschek.
Good night.

780
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,010
- Mr. Matuschek! Don't do that!
- Go away! Go away!

781
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:49,579
No, Mr. Matuschek!

782
00:49:03,469 --> 00:49:05,099
Why don't you go in, Kralik?

783
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:07,730
I really think you should go in
and keep your date.

784
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:10,599
Now, Pirovitch,
just do me a favor and deliver my note.

785
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:11,800
All right.

786
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,840
Pirovitch, I don't want to know
what she looks like.

787
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:18,579
If she's bad looking,
I've had enough bad news for today.

788
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:21,409
If she's lovely, it'll be more difficult,
so don't tell me.

789
00:49:21,489 --> 00:49:24,179
No, I won't.
Now, what's the name of that book?

790
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,190
- Anna Karenina, by Tolstoy.
- Anna Karenina.

791
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,250
- And a red carnation as a bookmark.
- Red carnation.

792
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:32,090
Now, let me see. Just a minute.

793
00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:39,400
- Do you see anything?
- Not yet.

794
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,210
- There's a beautiful girl!
- Really?

795
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,070
- very beautiful, but no book.
- No book.

796
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,210
- Wait a minute. I think I see it.
- Yeah?

797
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,719
Right here under the window. Yes.

798
00:49:54,289 --> 00:49:58,849
- "Anna Karenina by Tolstoy."
- That's right.

799
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,260
And a carnation.

800
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:05,320
I can't see her face.
She's sitting behind a clothes rack.

801
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:09,099
- There's a cup of coffee on the table.
- Yeah?

802
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,000
She's taking a piece of cake.

803
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,530
Kralik, she is dunking.

804
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,670
- Why shouldn't she dunk?
- All right.

805
00:50:15,739 --> 00:50:17,170
- All right.
- All right.

806
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:20,239
She is leaning forward now. She...

807
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:23,840
- Can you see her?
- Yes.

808
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,750
- Is she pretty?
- very pretty.

809
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,309
She is?

810
00:50:31,389 --> 00:50:33,550
I should say she looks...

811
00:50:33,829 --> 00:50:37,159
She has a little of the coloring of Klara.

812
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:40,659
Klara? What, Miss Novak of the shop?

813
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:44,099
Now, Kralik, you must admit
Klara's a very good-looking girl.

814
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:46,869
Personally, I've always found her
a very likeable girl.

815
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,599
This is a fine time
to talk about Miss Novak. Now...

816
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:53,039
If you don't like Miss Novak,
I can tell you, you won't like that girl.

817
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:55,010
- Why?
- Because it is Miss Novak.

818
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,289
Now...

819
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:19,630
...shall I give the note to the waiter?
- No.

820
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,469
What do you want to do,
let the poor girl wait?

821
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,309
Why shouldn't Miss Novak wait?

822
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,139
For the last six months
she's fought with me every day.

823
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,739
But still, she wrote those letters, my friend.

824
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,210
I know. My misfortune.

825
00:51:36,489 --> 00:51:38,889
- Goodbye, Pirovitch.
- Goodbye, Kralik.

826
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:40,579
Thank you.

827
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:51,190
- Excuse me, miss, could I have this chair?
- Oh, no! No, you can't!

828
00:51:51,269 --> 00:51:53,829
I'm expecting somebody.
He should be here any minute.

829
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:55,570
That's all right. That's...

830
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,039
Carnation, huh?

831
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:03,309
A few nights ago we had a case with roses.
Turned out very nice, very nice.

832
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:08,079
But once, about three months ago,
we had a very sad case with gardenias.

833
00:52:08,619 --> 00:52:10,849
She waited all evening and nobody came.

834
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,889
And when we cleaned the caf,
underneath one of the tables...

835
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,590
...we found another gardenia.

836
00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:18,090
Imagine, the man must've come in...

837
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:22,119
...taken one look at her, said, "Phooey,"
and threw away his gardenia.

838
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:26,300
Is your clock a little fast?
My own says 8:27 and yours says 8:31.

839
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:30,670
Listen, you have nothing to worry about,
a pretty girl like you.

840
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:34,139
If he doesn't come,
I'll put on a carnation myself.

841
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:35,699
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir.

842
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:10,199
- Hello, Miss Novak.
- Good evening, Mr. Kralik.

843
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,150
It's quite a coincidence.
I had an appointment here, too.

844
00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:16,590
- You haven't seen Mr. Pirovitch by chance?
- No, no, I haven't.

845
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:19,090
All right. Well, I think I'll wait.

846
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,949
- Do you mind if I sit down?
- Yes, I do.

847
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:24,500
You know,
I have an appointment, too, Mr. Kralik.

848
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,489
Oh, yes, I remember. Yes.

849
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:33,059
- My, your friend seems to be a little late.
- And I'll thank you not to be sarcastic.

850
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:35,769
I know you've had a bad day,
and you feel very bitter.

851
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,900
- Still, that's no reason...
- Bitter? Me?

852
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,739
About leaving Matuschek and Company?

853
00:53:39,809 --> 00:53:41,780
When I got home and sat at the phone...

854
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:44,469
...in five minutes I had
what amounts to two offers.

855
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:46,949
I congratulate you. I wish you good luck.

856
00:53:48,789 --> 00:53:52,019
I see you're reading
Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.

857
00:53:52,289 --> 00:53:53,349
Yes, do you mind?

858
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:56,590
No, no, I just didn't expect
to meet you in a caf...

859
00:53:56,659 --> 00:53:59,190
...with Tolstoy, that's all.
It's quite a surprise.

860
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,760
I didn't know you cared for high literature.

861
00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:04,929
There are many things
you don't know about me, Mr. Kralik.

862
00:54:07,469 --> 00:54:10,130
Have you read Crime and Punishment
by Dostoyevsky?

863
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,639
- No, I haven't.
- I have.

864
00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:18,179
There are many things
you don't know about me, Miss Novak.

865
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,480
As a matter of fact...

866
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,039
...there might be a lot
we don't know about each other.

867
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:25,559
People seldom go to the trouble
of scratching the surface of things...

868
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:27,150
...to find the inner truth.

869
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:30,250
I really wouldn't care
to scratch your surface, Mr. Kralik...

870
00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:32,389
...because I know exactly what I'd find.

871
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:34,559
Instead of a heart, a handbag.

872
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:36,860
Instead of a soul, a suitcase.

873
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:42,570
And instead of an intellect,
a cigarette lighter which doesn't work.

874
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,210
That's very nicely put.

875
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:49,139
Yes.

876
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:52,550
Comparing my intellect
with a cigarette lighter that doesn't work.

877
00:54:54,019 --> 00:54:58,849
Yeah, that's a very interesting mixture
of poetry and meanness.

878
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,119
Meanness? Let me...

879
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:03,519
Don't misunderstand me.
I'm only trying to pay you a compliment.

880
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,119
Mr. Kralik, please!
I told you I was expecting somebody.

881
00:55:08,369 --> 00:55:10,769
Look, if your party doesn't show up,
would l...

882
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,199
Don't worry about that.
My party will show up.

883
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:15,139
So you don't have to entertain me.

884
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:37,250
- Have you read Zola's Madame Bovary?
- Madame Bovary is not by Zola.

885
00:55:37,429 --> 00:55:39,329
Mr. Kralik, are you still here?

886
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,130
Are you deliberately trying
to spoil my evening?

887
00:55:42,199 --> 00:55:44,760
Why do you want to do me harm?
Why do you hate me so?

888
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,769
- I don't.
- I suppose you love me.

889
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,429
Why should I?
What've you done to make me love you?

890
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,599
- I don't want you to love me.
- I don't!

891
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:04,250
Do you know
what that tune reminds me of?

892
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,309
Yes, thank you.
Two dozen unsold cigarette boxes.

893
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,690
No, no. Wrong again.

894
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:12,500
It reminds me of a girl out of a job.

895
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,699
- A very nice girl, too, I thought.
- You thought that. How you can lie!

896
00:56:17,769 --> 00:56:20,400
But that was before you started
to make fun of me...

897
00:56:20,469 --> 00:56:23,070
...and giving imitations of me
in the locker room.

898
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,400
And I'd like to take this opportunity,
Miss Novak...

899
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,000
...to inform you that I don't walk
like a duck...

900
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:30,639
...and I'm not bowlegged.

901
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,920
- Aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

902
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:35,820
Well, I have information to the contrary.

903
00:56:35,889 --> 00:56:39,050
Mr. vadas assured me that you have
your trousers specially made.

904
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,219
That's a lie!

905
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:42,420
- So that's the kind of a man you trust.
- No!

906
00:56:42,489 --> 00:56:44,360
I've never been to a tailor in my life.

907
00:56:44,429 --> 00:56:47,400
If you think I'm bowlegged,
I'll pull up my trousers.

908
00:56:47,469 --> 00:56:50,059
Would you like it if made remarks
about your red hands?

909
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:53,099
- That's what you did.
- After you started making fun of my legs.

910
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:54,639
My hands aren't red at all!

911
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,869
No, after I called your attention to them.

912
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:58,800
Let me tell you something, Miss Novak.

913
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,780
You may have beautiful thoughts,
but you hide them.

914
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:05,010
As far as your actions,
you're cold and snippy like an old maid.

915
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:08,280
You'll have a tough time
getting a man to fall in love with you.

916
00:57:08,349 --> 00:57:12,190
An old maid?
So, no man could fall in love with me?

917
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,829
Mr. Kralik, you're getting funnier
every minute.

918
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,690
I could show you letters
that would open your eyes.

919
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:20,590
No, you probably wouldn't understand
what's in them.

920
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:24,760
They're written by a type of man
so far superior to you it isn't even funny.

921
00:57:25,699 --> 00:57:28,900
I have to laugh when I think of you
calling me an old maid.

922
00:57:29,139 --> 00:57:31,730
You little insignificant clerk.

923
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:48,659
- Goodbye, Miss Novak.
- Goodbye, Mr. Kralik.

924
00:58:01,409 --> 00:58:03,739
Doctor, I would say
it's a nervous breakdown.

925
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:05,199
What do you think?

926
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,539
It appears to be
an acute epileptoid manifestation...

927
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,170
...and a pan phobic melancholiac
with indication of a neurasthenia cordus.

928
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:13,409
Is that more expensive
than a nervous breakdown?

929
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:15,039
Pardon me, Mr. Katona.

930
00:58:15,219 --> 00:58:18,159
Precisely what position do you hold
with Matuschek and Company?

931
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,849
I would describe myself as a contact man.

932
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:24,019
I keep contact between Matuschek
and the customers...

933
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,630
...on a bicycle.

934
00:58:26,329 --> 00:58:27,960
Do you mean, an errand boy?

935
00:58:28,099 --> 00:58:30,289
Doctor, did I call you a pill-peddler?

936
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:38,670
- Hello, Mr. Kralik.
- How is he?

937
00:58:38,809 --> 00:58:41,869
I want to thank you
for your splendid reaction to my call.

938
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:43,880
- Is it serious?
- It was a terrible shock.

939
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:45,409
I have to get over it.

940
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,510
This thing must be kept in strict confidence
between the three of us.

941
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:51,489
Me, Mr. Matuschek, and you. Here.

942
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:02,500
Thank you for coming, Kralik.

943
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:04,869
Sit down.

944
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:13,139
Do you remember the last time
you came to my house for dinner?

945
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,940
I said that if things go well,
I might take it easier...

946
00:59:18,849 --> 00:59:22,119
...and maybe by Christmas
make you manager of the shop.

947
00:59:23,389 --> 00:59:26,519
Now I have to take it easier.

948
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,989
Would you care to work for me again?

949
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:35,460
No, don't even think about it, sir.

950
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,599
Is it possible that I ever distrusted you?

951
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:42,059
I hated you.

952
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,429
I couldn't stand your presence any more.

953
00:59:46,139 --> 00:59:48,579
That's how far jealousy can drive a man.

954
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,539
But that's all over now, sir.

955
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:57,880
When I first got that anonymous letter,
I laughed.

956
00:59:59,489 --> 01:00:04,360
My wife having secret rendezvous
with one of my employees.

957
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,489
My wife!

958
01:00:08,269 --> 01:00:10,289
But how could you suspect me, sir?

959
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:15,340
You see, you were the only one of
my employees who had been to my home...

960
01:00:16,469 --> 01:00:19,340
...and you sent my wife flowers...
- But that was...

961
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:21,409
You don't have to tell me.

962
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,750
When that poison gets into a man's mind...

963
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:32,250
- Just try to understand.
- I do understand, sir.

964
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,030
Here are the keys
to Matuschek and Company.

965
01:00:46,469 --> 01:00:48,000
Thank you, sir.

966
01:00:55,579 --> 01:00:57,210
What shall I do about Mr...

967
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,739
vadas? I want him dismissed
as quietly as possible.

968
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:03,909
No scandal.

969
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:08,860
Don't even mention the subject to him.
We won't lower ourselves.

970
01:01:08,929 --> 01:01:10,090
very good, sir.

971
01:01:10,289 --> 01:01:12,730
This will be the biggest Christmas
in the history...

972
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,420
...of Matuschek and Company.

973
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,469
- I know it will.
- Yes, sir. Goodbye.

974
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:20,199
- Kralik?
- Yes, sir?

975
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:25,909
Now that you're the boss,
if you want to give yourself a raise...

976
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:30,849
I'll talk it over with myself,
and if I don't want too much money...

977
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,320
...l'll give it to myself. Thank you, sir!

978
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:36,019
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

979
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:39,659
Goodbye, Mr. Matuschek.

980
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:43,659
Pepi, I don't know how to thank you.
You saved my life.

981
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:45,460
Don't mention it. It was a pleasure.

982
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:48,119
If you want anything else,
you know where to reach me.

983
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:51,289
I'm still nothing but an errand boy
at Matuschek and Company.

984
01:01:51,369 --> 01:01:53,929
In other words, you'd like to be a clerk?

985
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:56,000
I wouldn't put it that brutally.

986
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:59,340
- When I get feeling better...
- But then you might change your mind.

987
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,500
Who knows how long
you'll have to stay here.

988
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:05,980
You're a pretty sick man, Mr. Matuschek.
This isn't just an ordinary breakdown.

989
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,639
All right, you're a clerk.
Now, get out of here!

990
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,280
Thanks, Mr. Matuschek!

991
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:25,900
Kralik, I think I speak for all of us
when I say heartiest congratulations.

992
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:30,710
What a load off my mind.
Now we're all one little happy family again.

993
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,610
Be assured of my cooperation
to the fullest extent.

994
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:35,869
I want you to be a great success.

995
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:38,809
From now on, you're going to the office,
aren't you?

996
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,579
That's right.

997
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:41,710
If anybody deserves it, it's you, my boy.

998
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:43,349
Nice little ring, isn't it?

999
01:02:43,489 --> 01:02:46,010
I had a little luck last night, too.
Real diamond.

1000
01:02:46,389 --> 01:02:48,050
My grandma gave it to me.

1001
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:49,989
That's what you get
when you're a good boy.

1002
01:02:50,059 --> 01:02:51,550
Some get apples, I get diamonds.

1003
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:53,429
- Good one?
- Yeah.

1004
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,369
By the way, I have some unusual ideas
for that window display.

1005
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:59,699
Thank you, vadas.
The rest of us can take care of the windows.

1006
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:02,730
Right now, I'd like you to go
into the stockroom...

1007
01:03:02,869 --> 01:03:05,429
...and you know those big suitcases
on the top shelf?

1008
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:08,340
- The black ones?
- That's right, and the big brown suitcases.

1009
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,380
- On the bottom shelf?
- On the bottom.

1010
01:03:10,449 --> 01:03:14,039
I want you to take all
the big black suitcases from the top shelf...

1011
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:16,920
...and move them to the bottom,
and the big brown ones...

1012
01:03:16,989 --> 01:03:19,550
...from the bottom shelf
and move them to the top shelf.

1013
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:22,820
- You don't want to do it?
- I didn't say that. Of course I'll do it.

1014
01:03:22,889 --> 01:03:25,760
- I'm a good soldier.
- All right, do it right away.

1015
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,519
Thank you.

1016
01:03:46,849 --> 01:03:48,750
312-683, please.

1017
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:52,289
Is this the Atlas Employment Agency?

1018
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:55,219
This is Mr. Katona
of Matuschek and Company speaking.

1019
01:03:55,429 --> 01:03:58,449
We have an opening for a new errand boy.
Now see here.

1020
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:02,329
I want a educated, healthy boy,
good family and no bad habits.

1021
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:06,369
Send me four or five. I'll look them over.
Right away, if you please.

1022
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,409
Tell them to ask for Mr. Katona,
the sales department.

1023
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:10,500
All right.

1024
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:14,940
What's the matter,
didn't you ever see a clerk before?

1025
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:18,480
- Who made you a clerk?
- Yes, who did this dreadful thing?

1026
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:22,480
I can't give you the whole story.
I'm tied up with my word of honor.

1027
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:26,280
If it hadn't been for me, this place would
be closed on account of suicide...

1028
01:04:26,389 --> 01:04:28,090
...and you'd all be out of a job.

1029
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:32,989
Matuschek and Company, good morning.
Yes, Mrs. Matuschek.

1030
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,760
Don't miss this, folks.

1031
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:38,900
Hello, Mrs. Matuschek.

1032
01:04:39,539 --> 01:04:42,059
Yes, this is Pepi speaking.

1033
01:04:42,539 --> 01:04:44,530
That's right.

1034
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,329
I didn't bring you that bottle of perfume?

1035
01:04:47,809 --> 01:04:50,800
Well, you're never going to get it!
What do you think of that?

1036
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,940
Your perfume days are over, Mrs. M!

1037
01:04:54,219 --> 01:04:56,849
Yes! This is Pepi speaking.

1038
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:01,159
You want to speak to Mr. Matuschek?
That's too bad.

1039
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,460
At the moment he's up in a balloon
with two blondes.

1040
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,329
Now watch this.

1041
01:05:06,699 --> 01:05:10,159
You wouldn't like to speak
by any chance to Mr. vadas?

1042
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,739
That got her. Draw your own conclusions.

1043
01:05:21,409 --> 01:05:23,000
You sent for me, chief?

1044
01:05:24,349 --> 01:05:26,539
vadas, I'm a little worried about you.

1045
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:30,150
Will you be comfortable
under a former, fellow clerk?

1046
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,650
Working under a younger man?

1047
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,920
Kralik, this is the age of youth,
and I always ride with the times.

1048
01:05:34,989 --> 01:05:37,190
You're a smart young man
and my hat's off to you.

1049
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:40,199
Let's stop beating around the bush.
You and I never got along.

1050
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,760
- You really think so?
- Admit it. You don't like me.

1051
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,230
I don't? Wait a minute, Kralik.
You are the boss.

1052
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,599
That's right,
but I'm not going to be a "yes" man.

1053
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:51,070
You know what I'll do?
I'm going to contradict you.

1054
01:05:51,309 --> 01:05:52,539
I do like you!

1055
01:05:52,909 --> 01:05:55,880
- Anything else bothering you?
- Yes. I don't like you.

1056
01:05:57,079 --> 01:06:00,639
That's every man's privilege.
I thank you for being so frank.

1057
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:04,409
Now I know my problem,
and it's up to me to change your mind.

1058
01:06:04,659 --> 01:06:07,059
I don't think it'll be so hard.

1059
01:06:07,289 --> 01:06:09,559
I heard the funniest joke.
Do you want to hear it?

1060
01:06:09,659 --> 01:06:10,519
No!

1061
01:06:12,329 --> 01:06:13,130
Hello!

1062
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,289
Yes, this is Matuschek and Company.

1063
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:18,199
Johanna?

1064
01:06:19,239 --> 01:06:21,260
You're calling for Miss Novak.

1065
01:06:21,739 --> 01:06:25,400
What's the matter with her?
I hope it's nothing serious.

1066
01:06:26,309 --> 01:06:29,139
Fine, I'm glad to hear that.
Tell her not to worry.

1067
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:32,340
Unless she's absolutely all right,
tell her not to come today.

1068
01:06:32,679 --> 01:06:34,340
No, there's no hurry now.

1069
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:37,710
Tell her to be sure and take good care
of herself. All right.

1070
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:42,230
- Really, Kralik, that's a wonderful attitude.
- What's so wonderful about it?

1071
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:44,230
I've been around, and I have my eyes open.

1072
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:47,320
If anyone didn't agree with you here,
it was Miss Novak.

1073
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,920
Just leave Miss Novak out of this.

1074
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,760
Don't misunderstand.
I have nothing against Miss Novak.

1075
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:55,429
On the contrary, she's a nice girl.
Only sometimes, she went too far.

1076
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:59,329
Not another word about Miss Novak.
She's a fine girl and a hard worker...

1077
01:06:59,409 --> 01:07:02,170
...and she's a good salesgirl,
and you shut up!

1078
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,409
You misunderstand me.
I didn't mean any offense.

1079
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,780
- I was agreeing with you.
- I don't want you to agree with me!

1080
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,380
You're fired.

1081
01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:13,480
You're fired. Get out of here,
you two-faced, double-crossing...

1082
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:15,489
...two-timer! Go on. Get out of here!

1083
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:16,960
Folks! Folks!

1084
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:18,389
Folks!

1085
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:22,099
Did you hear what he called me?
Remember it on the witness stand.

1086
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:25,030
He called me a double-crossing two-timer!

1087
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:27,539
I told you to get out of here! Get out!

1088
01:07:28,409 --> 01:07:30,400
Don't you push. Don't you push!

1089
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:33,340
What right have you got to fire me?
Does Mr. Matuschek know?

1090
01:07:33,409 --> 01:07:36,280
No! Mr. Matuschek doesn't know
anything about this.

1091
01:07:36,349 --> 01:07:38,469
I'm the manager,
and you don't work here anymore!

1092
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:42,880
How do I know you're the manager?
Prove it to me in black and white.

1093
01:07:42,949 --> 01:07:45,650
You're going to get it in black and blue.

1094
01:07:56,570 --> 01:08:00,590
All right! Nice little case
of assault and battery.

1095
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:03,400
You'll hear from my lawyer.
What about my salary?

1096
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:05,099
Get the man's salary.

1097
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:08,639
- Here it is, Mr. vadas.
- We have everything prepared.

1098
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:12,150
- We don't want to waste any time.
- Pardon me, sir. Your garments.

1099
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,550
I'm entitled to a letter of reference.

1100
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:17,949
I forgot it. Flora, take a letter.

1101
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:22,619
To whom it may concern:
Mr. vadas has been in the employ...

1102
01:08:22,689 --> 01:08:26,600
...of Matuschek and Company for two years
during which time he's been efficient...

1103
01:08:26,659 --> 01:08:29,000
...as a stool pigeon,
a troublemaker, and a rat.

1104
01:08:29,069 --> 01:08:31,560
If he doesn't clear out,
he'll get a punch in the nose.

1105
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,229
Truly, Alfred Kralik,
Manager of Matuschek and Company.

1106
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:16,569
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Novak.

1107
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:20,609
I suppose you're surprised to see me back.

1108
01:09:20,989 --> 01:09:25,180
Naturally. I'm glad you have your
job back again. I congratulate you.

1109
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,050
I hear you haven't been feeling well.

1110
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:32,220
That's all right, thank you.
I wanted to see Mr. Matuschek.

1111
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,800
Here he is. I'm Mr. Matuschek.

1112
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:41,699
Mr. Kralik, don't make any jokes.
Not today.

1113
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,600
Please, if you want to pick on me,
do it some other time.

1114
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:47,470
I don't know what to say.

1115
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:52,210
I'm trying to tell you that Mr. Matuschek
isn't here, and that I'm the manager.

1116
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,180
Haven't you got any heart at all?
I'm not well, I can hardly see straight.

1117
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:59,279
Everything is just going round and round.

1118
01:09:59,489 --> 01:10:04,659
I ask you a simple question and instead of
any consideration, you try to frighten me.

1119
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,750
Excuse me.

1120
01:10:10,699 --> 01:10:11,760
Hello.

1121
01:10:13,069 --> 01:10:14,060
Mr. Foeldes?

1122
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:16,069
Hello, Mr. Foeldes.

1123
01:10:16,609 --> 01:10:18,670
Yes. Well, thank you very much.

1124
01:10:18,939 --> 01:10:20,930
Yes, it all happened this morning.

1125
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:23,779
That's right, Mr. Foeldes.

1126
01:10:23,909 --> 01:10:26,439
No, Mr. Matuschek won't be with us
for a while.

1127
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:32,050
Now, please, Mr. Foeldes.
I don't own the shop yet.

1128
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:33,590
I'm only the manager.

1129
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:37,090
Goodbye, Mr...

1130
01:10:37,229 --> 01:10:38,989
Miss Novak! Klara! Klara!

1131
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:50,569
- Good evening, Miss Novak.
- Good evening, Mr. Kralik.

1132
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:53,180
I hope you'll forgive this intrusion, but I...

1133
01:10:54,109 --> 01:10:59,050
Being in charge of the shop,
I feel like a father to our little family.

1134
01:11:01,819 --> 01:11:04,720
Anyway, how are you, young lady?

1135
01:11:05,619 --> 01:11:09,420
I'll be all right, Mr. Kralik. Please sit down.

1136
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,050
Thank you.

1137
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:19,560
Christmas is coming, and we'll miss
a good worker like you in the shop.

1138
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:21,100
So you better get well.

1139
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:23,210
I'll be all right in a day or two.

1140
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:25,970
That doesn't mean
that you should neglect yourself.

1141
01:11:26,109 --> 01:11:27,810
I'm very serious about this...

1142
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:31,310
...because I feel responsible
for the whole thing.

1143
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:32,510
- You?
- Yes.

1144
01:11:32,779 --> 01:11:36,909
Oh, no, Mr. Kralik.
I think I can relieve your mind.

1145
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:38,890
It wasn't your fault at all.

1146
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:43,960
No, there's a much bigger reason,
unfortunately.

1147
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:46,859
Shouldn't you call a doctor?

1148
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:49,060
No, I don't need to see a doctor.

1149
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:52,239
My trouble is what one might call...

1150
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,159
...psychological.

1151
01:11:56,010 --> 01:12:00,199
It's my own personal problem,
and I'll come out of it.

1152
01:12:00,979 --> 01:12:04,710
I'm sorry.
It's a shame you have to go through all this.

1153
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:08,789
As long as it's only psychological,
you won't...

1154
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:10,289
Only psychological!

1155
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:15,180
Mr. Kralik, it's true we're
in the same room...

1156
01:12:16,789 --> 01:12:18,789
...but we're not on the same planet.

1157
01:12:21,899 --> 01:12:26,699
Miss Novak, although I'm the victim
of your remark...

1158
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:31,699
...I can't help but admire the exquisite way
you have of expressing yourself.

1159
01:12:34,279 --> 01:12:36,970
You certainly know how
to put a man in his planet.

1160
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:39,579
Aunt Anna has something for you!

1161
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,680
She has? Why doesn't she come in?
Come in, Aunt Anna!

1162
01:12:45,289 --> 01:12:47,810
This is Mr. Kralik
of Matuschek and Company.

1163
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:49,760
- I'm glad to meet you.
- How do you do?

1164
01:12:49,859 --> 01:12:52,159
- I hope it's good news.
- I'll tell you later.

1165
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,500
Mr. Kralik, it was kind of you to drop in.

1166
01:12:59,569 --> 01:13:01,470
I don't want to spoil your whole evening.

1167
01:13:01,539 --> 01:13:04,470
I have nothing to do.
Go ahead and read the letter.

1168
01:13:04,579 --> 01:13:06,069
Don't worry about me.

1169
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,170
- Lf you don't mind.
- Not at all.

1170
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:35,899
- Good news?
- very good news.

1171
01:13:36,609 --> 01:13:40,439
I can promise you I'll be back in the shop
tomorrow, and I'll be on my toes!

1172
01:13:40,609 --> 01:13:42,939
I'll sell more goods than ever before.

1173
01:13:44,479 --> 01:13:47,880
That's quite a change in you.
It's amazing what one letter can do.

1174
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:50,989
If I weren't feeling so happy,
I'd be very annoyed with you.

1175
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,489
With me? Why?

1176
01:13:53,859 --> 01:13:56,329
Why? Because you spoiled
my date last night.

1177
01:13:56,659 --> 01:13:59,529
I wasn't so wrong when I asked you
not to sit at my table.

1178
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:01,720
This gentleman did come to the caf.

1179
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,529
He looked in the window,
saw us together, and misunderstood.

1180
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:09,029
- He thought you and I were friends?
- He must have. Listen.

1181
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:14,140
"Tell me and be frank.
I think you owe it to me.

1182
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:19,770
"Who is this very attractive young man?
He's just the type women fall for."

1183
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:30,449
- I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.
- It's all right. I'll straighten it out.

1184
01:14:30,529 --> 01:14:32,689
It won't hurt him to be a little jealous.

1185
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:38,260
He doesn't seem to be much of a man,
this friend of yours.

1186
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,670
I mean, he walks away.

1187
01:14:39,739 --> 01:14:42,829
He's afraid to come over to the table
when another man is there.

1188
01:14:42,909 --> 01:14:46,600
No, Mr. Kralik, he's wasn't afraid,
I can assure you.

1189
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,109
He's tactful. He's sensitive.

1190
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:52,640
He's not the type of man who would
walk up to a table uninvited.

1191
01:14:53,149 --> 01:14:56,640
It's difficult to explain a man like him
to a man like you.

1192
01:14:56,989 --> 01:14:59,850
Where you would say, "black,"
he would say, "white."

1193
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,949
Where you would say, "ugly,"
he says, "beautiful."

1194
01:15:04,329 --> 01:15:07,859
And when you say, "old maid," he says:

1195
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:12,659
"Eyes that sparkle with fire and mystery...

1196
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:16,170
"vivacious.

1197
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:19,670
"Fascinating."

1198
01:15:23,109 --> 01:15:25,340
I remind him of gypsy music.

1199
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:31,210
Speaking of gypsy music,
we've had a lot of trouble...

1200
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:33,619
...selling those Ochi Tchornya boxes,
haven't we?

1201
01:15:33,689 --> 01:15:37,090
- That doesn't make any difference.
- You can consider one box sold.

1202
01:15:37,329 --> 01:15:41,260
Yes. I've just had an inspiration.
I'll give one to my friend for Christmas.

1203
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:44,500
Miss Novak, you're taking an awful chance.

1204
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:49,270
Why don't you give him a wallet?
I'm sure he'd be crazy about it.

1205
01:15:49,409 --> 01:15:54,069
Any man would be. A wallet is practical.
Besides, we have those imported pigskins.

1206
01:15:54,279 --> 01:15:57,270
- I'm not interested.
- I'd make you a special price.

1207
01:15:57,510 --> 01:15:58,979
No, I'm sorry.

1208
01:16:00,279 --> 01:16:03,220
Besides being a practical thing...

1209
01:16:03,289 --> 01:16:05,949
...a wallet is quite romantic.

1210
01:16:06,689 --> 01:16:10,649
On one side he has your last letter,
on the other side, a picture of you.

1211
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,789
When he opens it, there you are.

1212
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:16,930
And that's all the music he wants.

1213
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,090
Why, Mr. Kralik, you surprise me.

1214
01:16:23,069 --> 01:16:25,409
That's very well-expressed.

1215
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,079
I must admit, that's very nice.

1216
01:16:29,909 --> 01:16:33,079
No, just the same,
I'm going to give him a cigarette box.

1217
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:39,010
There's not much more I can say.

1218
01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:41,380
Except that I wish
both of you a Merry Christmas.

1219
01:16:41,489 --> 01:16:44,819
- Thank you, Mr. Kralik, good night.
- Good night, Miss Novak.

1220
01:16:57,039 --> 01:16:59,130
- Rudy!
- Yes, Mr. Katona?

1221
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,109
Do you know what time it is?

1222
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:03,579
- A few minutes after 8:00.
- And you're still here?

1223
01:17:03,649 --> 01:17:06,640
- Don't contradict me, just listen!
- Yes, Mr. Katona.

1224
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:10,550
You have to be faster,
especially on Christmas Eve.

1225
01:17:11,819 --> 01:17:12,850
Am I asking too much?

1226
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,909
- No, Mr. Katona.
- All right.

1227
01:17:19,229 --> 01:17:20,359
I have great news.

1228
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:23,229
I talked to the hospital,
and Mr. Matuschek is much better.

1229
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,859
- That's wonderful!
- Can we visit him?

1230
01:17:25,939 --> 01:17:28,909
Let's all get together
and buy him a nice Christmas present.

1231
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:32,029
Let's get him a little Christmas tree
for his hospital room.

1232
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:36,409
That's all very nice, but the best present
we could give him is a bare-looking shop...

1233
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:39,210
...with nothing in it except money
in the cash register.

1234
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:40,250
Now, come on, folks!

1235
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:44,409
Let's make this the biggest Christmas Eve
in the history of Matuschek and Company.

1236
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:47,880
Where's Klara! Klara! Miss Novak!

1237
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:50,619
Coming! Yes, Mr. Kralik, what is it?

1238
01:17:51,189 --> 01:17:53,390
- How are you today?
- Fine.

1239
01:17:53,529 --> 01:17:57,090
Good. We're expecting terrific business
today. It's going to be tough.

1240
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:58,460
But don't overdo it.

1241
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:14,310
Miss Novak, may I ask a favor of you?

1242
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,449
With pleasure, Mr. Pirovitch.

1243
01:18:16,689 --> 01:18:20,710
I wanted to buy one of those
Ochi Tchornya boxes, but Kralik tells me...

1244
01:18:20,859 --> 01:18:23,260
...you took the only one that really works.

1245
01:18:23,659 --> 01:18:27,649
That's right. I bought it for my boyfriend.

1246
01:18:30,069 --> 01:18:32,930
He's coming tonight.
We're going to celebrate Christmas Eve.

1247
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:38,909
- Mr. Pirovitch, can you keep a secret?
- On my word of honor.

1248
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:43,979
When I come back Monday,
I might have a ring on my finger.

1249
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,979
Maybe, you never know.

1250
01:18:46,279 --> 01:18:47,909
What? That's wonderful!

1251
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:51,380
And that's the young man
who'll get the cigarette box?

1252
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:52,850
Then let's drop the whole thing.

1253
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,359
You see, I thought of giving it
to my wife's uncle for Christmas.

1254
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:58,590
I'm sorry,
can't you give him something else?

1255
01:18:58,659 --> 01:19:02,220
It's not so easy. You see, I don't like him.

1256
01:19:02,670 --> 01:19:06,260
I hate to spend a nickel on him.
Still, I must give him a present.

1257
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:08,840
I thought if I have to give him a present...

1258
01:19:08,909 --> 01:19:11,369
...I might as well give him something
he won't enjoy.

1259
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:13,029
The box costs 2.29.

1260
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:16,979
That's a lot of money, but it's worth it
to ruin my wife's uncle's Christmas.

1261
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:24,649
I'm sorry, Miss Novak.
I forgot you always liked those.

1262
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:27,579
No, no, Mr. Pirovitch. Speak freely.

1263
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:31,619
If you were in my position...

1264
01:19:31,699 --> 01:19:33,390
...what would you give him?

1265
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,550
That's hard to say.

1266
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:38,729
What would you say to the idea of...

1267
01:19:39,369 --> 01:19:42,000
...let's say, maybe, a wallet?

1268
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,039
That's an inspiration.

1269
01:19:45,109 --> 01:19:49,569
- One of those imported pigskins?
- That's what I was thinking of.

1270
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:51,180
You can't miss.

1271
01:19:51,479 --> 01:19:54,710
If I would get such a wallet, I would be...

1272
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:57,119
...one of the happiest men in the world.

1273
01:19:57,390 --> 01:20:00,380
On one side... Here, I'll show you.

1274
01:20:01,659 --> 01:20:03,920
On one side, I put a picture of my wife...

1275
01:20:04,189 --> 01:20:07,159
...and on the other side, my little baby.

1276
01:20:07,229 --> 01:20:13,229
When I open it,
it says, "Papa" and not "Ochi Tchornya."

1277
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:17,399
Thank you, Mr. Pirovitch. I'll think it over.

1278
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:23,979
Kralik, you'll get the wallet.

1279
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:10,720
Mr. Matuschek, what are doing here?
Since when are you back?

1280
01:21:10,789 --> 01:21:15,090
I'm supposed to be a pretty sick man,
that's what my doctor tells me.

1281
01:21:15,430 --> 01:21:19,199
But after all, it's Christmas Eve.
I couldn't stay away any longer.

1282
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,060
Can you imagine me,
over two weeks in the hospital...

1283
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:24,039
...without seeing a single customer?

1284
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:27,699
The only piece of leather goods
in the place was my nurse's handbag.

1285
01:21:27,909 --> 01:21:31,369
And where do you think she got it?
At Blasek and Company!

1286
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:33,479
And they expect me to get well?

1287
01:21:33,649 --> 01:21:37,310
- Have you been by Blasek and Company?
- Oh, yes.

1288
01:21:37,449 --> 01:21:42,260
- What kind of business are they doing?
- They're busy, but no comparison with this.

1289
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:43,979
Good. This is all right.

1290
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:47,890
Mr. Matuschek, take it easy. Don't overdo.

1291
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:51,069
No, I'm not, don't be. I'm not a fool.

1292
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:55,130
I came around to find out
if the shop was still here. And then I go.

1293
01:21:55,239 --> 01:21:58,609
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Matuschek.
- Same to you.

1294
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:03,039
- Do you think Eric would like that briefcase?
- I don't know. I'm not so sure.

1295
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:08,020
Pardon me, ladies.
I can't see very well without my glasses.

1296
01:22:08,149 --> 01:22:10,449
Could you tell me the price
on that briefcase?

1297
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:11,779
24.50.

1298
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:16,220
24.50! My, what values you get here.

1299
01:22:16,359 --> 01:22:18,949
I wonder how Matuschek and Company
can do it.

1300
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:22,390
If you don't know, Mr. Matuschek,
who should?

1301
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:33,699
How much is it?

1302
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:39,750
9,654.75.

1303
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:41,420
That's wonderful.

1304
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:47,590
That's the biggest day since '28.
You should be very proud.

1305
01:22:47,819 --> 01:22:50,819
I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

1306
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:54,600
Two hours ago when I walked in here,
I was a sick man.

1307
01:22:54,699 --> 01:22:59,569
But you, Kralik, and you, Pirovitch,
you're the best doctors.

1308
01:23:00,369 --> 01:23:05,270
And you, Klara and llona and Flora,
you're wonderful nurses.

1309
01:23:05,579 --> 01:23:06,470
Thank you.

1310
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,869
Pepi, you know what I think about you.

1311
01:23:10,279 --> 01:23:11,340
Yes, sir.

1312
01:23:12,819 --> 01:23:17,340
This morning when I received
the little Christmas tree you all sent me...

1313
01:23:17,850 --> 01:23:20,079
...I was deeply moved.

1314
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:22,880
I read your little note over and over.

1315
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:27,029
And it made me very happy
that you missed me...

1316
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:30,359
...and hoped that I'd be coming back home
soon again.

1317
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:35,029
You're right, this is my home.

1318
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:39,140
This is where I spent most of my life.

1319
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:45,100
No Christmas is complete without a bonus.

1320
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:51,250
- Kralik.
- Thank you, sir.

1321
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:53,079
Klara.

1322
01:23:55,529 --> 01:23:57,760
- Pepi.
- Thank you, sir.

1323
01:23:58,359 --> 01:24:00,060
Flora. Here.

1324
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:05,460
- Ilona.
- Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.

1325
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,460
And Pirovitch.

1326
01:24:09,239 --> 01:24:13,699
I've called you names on several occasions.

1327
01:24:13,909 --> 01:24:17,609
When you see the bonus,
you'll realize that I didn't mean it.

1328
01:24:17,949 --> 01:24:20,039
Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.

1329
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:23,710
I guess that's about all.

1330
01:24:24,189 --> 01:24:26,350
Here, what's your name?

1331
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:28,109
Rudy.

1332
01:24:28,789 --> 01:24:30,659
- Well, Rudy.
- Good boy.

1333
01:24:33,699 --> 01:24:35,189
Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.

1334
01:24:35,869 --> 01:24:37,329
It's all right, Rudy.

1335
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:40,430
Too much.

1336
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,170
We'll leave the shop just as it is
until after the holiday.

1337
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:47,670
I want you all to go home now
and have a very Merry Christmas.

1338
01:24:48,609 --> 01:24:50,310
Thank you.

1339
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:54,250
Well, Kralik...

1340
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:58,850
...9,654.75.

1341
01:24:59,689 --> 01:25:02,090
That's wonderful.

1342
01:25:02,529 --> 01:25:04,520
Thank you, Flora.

1343
01:25:14,039 --> 01:25:15,659
Well, I think I'll have a...

1344
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,300
...little dinner now,
and celebrate Christmas.

1345
01:25:19,909 --> 01:25:21,739
Have you ever been to Biro's?

1346
01:25:22,149 --> 01:25:24,739
No sir, I'm afraid that's way over my head.

1347
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:29,439
Christmas only comes once a year.
How about joining me...

1348
01:25:29,619 --> 01:25:32,109
...and we'll break a bottle
of champagne together?

1349
01:25:32,689 --> 01:25:37,289
- Mr. Matuschek, I'd love nothing more...
- You have another engagement?

1350
01:25:38,329 --> 01:25:42,699
No, not another word.
I wanted to be sure that you weren't alone.

1351
01:25:43,529 --> 01:25:46,560
Have a wonderful time,
and Merry Christmas.

1352
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:47,970
The same to you, sir.

1353
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:04,880
Well, Pirovitch.

1354
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:09,010
I presume you're going to have
a nice party at your house tonight.

1355
01:26:09,090 --> 01:26:11,029
Yes, I should say.

1356
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,829
You probably have some guests?

1357
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:19,399
No, just my wife, my boy,
and my little baby and myself.

1358
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:21,930
That's all we want, and we are very happy.

1359
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:26,729
- Well, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Matuschek.

1360
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:38,750
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Matuschek.
- Thank you, Flora.

1361
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:41,909
- Please, give my regards to your mother.
- Thank you.

1362
01:26:45,529 --> 01:26:49,060
Still hanging around the shop,
Mr. Matuschek? Can't get away from here.

1363
01:26:49,899 --> 01:26:52,560
You'd better hurry home, son.

1364
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,140
You're probably celebrating Christmas
with your family. Am I wrong?

1365
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:59,210
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
See that girl over there on the corner?

1366
01:26:59,479 --> 01:27:01,100
- Yeah.
- I'm her Santa Claus.

1367
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:04,140
- Good night, Mr. Matuschek.
- Good night.

1368
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:12,409
Mr. Matuschek, I don't know how
to thank you for that marvelous present.

1369
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,720
After all, I'm only working here
a short time.

1370
01:27:15,859 --> 01:27:18,260
That's all right. What was your name?

1371
01:27:18,659 --> 01:27:20,220
Rudy.

1372
01:27:20,359 --> 01:27:22,229
- How old are you, Rudy?
- 17.

1373
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:26,159
That's a wonderful age.
You've got your whole life ahead of you.

1374
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,770
- It's up to you what you make of it.
- Yes, sir.

1375
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:33,199
You better not squander that money.
Go home and give it to your mother.

1376
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:36,439
- My people don't live here in town.
- Is that so?

1377
01:27:36,949 --> 01:27:39,710
- Have you no other relations here?
- No, Mr. Matuschek.

1378
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:43,479
You're all alone in Budapest
on Christmas Eve?

1379
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:44,909
That's right.

1380
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:49,420
Rudy! Do you like chicken noodle soup?

1381
01:27:50,029 --> 01:27:51,489
I certainly do.

1382
01:27:51,630 --> 01:27:56,399
And what would you think of roast goose
stuffed with baked apples?

1383
01:27:56,829 --> 01:28:00,560
And fresh boiled potatoes and butter
and some red cabbage on the side?

1384
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:02,199
I'd love it!

1385
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:05,500
And then cucumber salad with sour cream?

1386
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:11,079
Then a double order of apple strudel
with vanilla sauce.

1387
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:12,680
Sounds wonderful!

1388
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:16,220
You're going to have it, Rudy.
Come on. Here, taxi!

1389
01:28:18,989 --> 01:28:21,859
- It's lovely, I'm sure he'll like it.
- I think so, too.

1390
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:26,149
Merry Christmas, Klara. I hope
it all turns out the way you want it to.

1391
01:28:26,359 --> 01:28:28,800
- Thanks, llona.
- Good night.

1392
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:40,609
- I'm sorry, I'll be out in a second.
- That's all right, no hurry.

1393
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:47,510
I decided to follow your advice after all.

1394
01:28:48,989 --> 01:28:50,380
Want to see something?

1395
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:08,470
That's beautiful.

1396
01:29:09,069 --> 01:29:10,699
Why don't you try it on?

1397
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:14,470
I'd like to see what it looks like on a girl.

1398
01:29:21,149 --> 01:29:23,779
- Are those real diamonds?
- They're pretty near.

1399
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:30,819
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.

1400
01:29:31,029 --> 01:29:34,159
Yes, it probably isn't easy for you
to imagine anyone...

1401
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:36,699
...could like a man of my type.

1402
01:29:36,829 --> 01:29:39,319
Let's not start all over again.

1403
01:29:39,539 --> 01:29:43,869
It's Christmas, and I'd like to be friends.
Beside, you're wrong.

1404
01:29:44,939 --> 01:29:48,310
- Do you mind if I tell you something?
- No, not at all.

1405
01:29:48,979 --> 01:29:53,039
When I first came to work here,
something very strange happened to me.

1406
01:29:53,979 --> 01:29:56,350
I got psychologically mixed up.

1407
01:29:56,590 --> 01:29:57,609
- You don't say?
- Yes.

1408
01:29:57,689 --> 01:30:00,119
I found myself looking at you
again and again.

1409
01:30:00,189 --> 01:30:02,819
I just couldn't take my eyes off of you.

1410
01:30:03,659 --> 01:30:08,029
I kept saying, "Klara Novak,
what on earth is the matter with you.

1411
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:10,829
"This Kralik is not
a particularly attractive man."

1412
01:30:10,899 --> 01:30:13,369
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, not at all.

1413
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:16,729
Now, here comes the paradox.
I found myself falling for you.

1414
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:19,810
- I can't believe it.
- Yes, and very much so.

1415
01:30:19,939 --> 01:30:23,279
- You certainly didn't show it.
- In those first few weeks...

1416
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:26,909
I know you won't misconstrue
what I'm going to say to you.

1417
01:30:26,979 --> 01:30:30,109
After all, I'm happily engaged.
At least it looks that way.

1418
01:30:30,189 --> 01:30:31,380
Go on.

1419
01:30:31,449 --> 01:30:36,020
In those first few weeks,
there were moments in the stockroom...

1420
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:39,489
...when you could have swept me
off of my feet.

1421
01:30:41,899 --> 01:30:44,369
Now I'm getting psychologically mixed up.

1422
01:30:44,529 --> 01:30:48,560
I was a different girl, then.
I was rather naive.

1423
01:30:48,739 --> 01:30:51,970
All my knowledge came from books,
and I'd just finished a novel...

1424
01:30:52,039 --> 01:30:56,439
...about a glamorous French actress
from the Comdie Franaise.

1425
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:58,539
That's a theater in France.

1426
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:02,119
When she wanted to arouse a man's
interest, she treated him like a dog.

1427
01:31:02,289 --> 01:31:04,189
Yes, you treated me like a dog.

1428
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:07,090
But instead of licking my hand, you barked.

1429
01:31:08,489 --> 01:31:12,789
My mistake was I didn't realize that the
difference between this glamorous lady...

1430
01:31:12,899 --> 01:31:16,300
...and me was that she was with
the Comdie Franaise...

1431
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:18,760
...and I was with Matuschek and Company.

1432
01:31:18,899 --> 01:31:21,340
Well, that's all forgotten now.

1433
01:31:21,569 --> 01:31:25,010
Now you're going to see your girlfriend.
By the way, is it serious?

1434
01:31:25,739 --> 01:31:27,140
Yes, very.

1435
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:32,010
Maybe we'll both be engaged
Monday morning.

1436
01:31:32,649 --> 01:31:34,310
I think we will.

1437
01:31:34,449 --> 01:31:37,609
Don't misunderstand me.
I just said in my case, it might happen.

1438
01:31:37,789 --> 01:31:41,479
As a matter of fact,
I can tell you, it will happen.

1439
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,250
How do you know?

1440
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:47,560
We won't go into that.

1441
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:57,300
Mr. Kralik, what do you mean you know?

1442
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:00,430
I guess I might as well tell you.
He came to see me.

1443
01:32:00,579 --> 01:32:02,569
- Who?
- Your fiance.

1444
01:32:02,779 --> 01:32:05,770
Yes, he came last night.
You shouldn't have told him who I am.

1445
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:07,210
I spent an uncomfortable hour.

1446
01:32:07,279 --> 01:32:11,380
Apparently, he didn't believe it when
you wrote that I meant nothing to you.

1447
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:15,109
I can't get it into my head.
Coming to see you?

1448
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:19,250
- That doesn't sound like him at all.
- I've straightened everything out.

1449
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:22,859
You don't have to worry.
In a little while you'll be Mrs. Popkin.

1450
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:26,430
Mrs. Popkin?

1451
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:30,229
That's the name, isn't it?
That's the name he gave me.

1452
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:33,670
Oh, yes, that's right. Popkin. Popkin.

1453
01:32:33,979 --> 01:32:38,039
A very nice fellow. I congratulate you.

1454
01:32:38,609 --> 01:32:39,600
Thank you.

1455
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:45,710
I think he's a very attractive man,
don't you?

1456
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:51,289
Yes. For his type, I'd say yes.

1457
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:55,819
You would classify him as a definite type?

1458
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:59,930
Absolutely! And don't try to change him.

1459
01:33:01,069 --> 01:33:02,770
Don't put him on a diet.

1460
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:07,970
- Would you call him fat?
- I wouldn't, but that's a matter of opinion.

1461
01:33:08,109 --> 01:33:11,880
I think that little stomach of his
gives him a nice, homey quality.

1462
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:14,210
That's what you want in a husband, isn't it?

1463
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:18,340
- Yes, that's what I want.
- And you're perfectly right.

1464
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:21,989
If I were a girl and had to choose
between a young, good-for-nothing...

1465
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:24,689
...with plenty of hair,
and a solid, mature citizen...

1466
01:33:24,789 --> 01:33:26,920
...l'd pick Mathias Popkin every time.

1467
01:33:29,930 --> 01:33:32,590
Anyway, he has a fine mind.

1468
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:35,800
Didn't he impress you
as being rather witty?

1469
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:39,739
He struck me as rather depressed,
but it's unfair to judge a man...

1470
01:33:39,810 --> 01:33:41,279
...when he's out of a job.

1471
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:43,439
Out of a job! He never told me!

1472
01:33:43,609 --> 01:33:45,479
That shows you how sensitive he is.

1473
01:33:45,579 --> 01:33:47,520
You have nothing to worry about.

1474
01:33:47,579 --> 01:33:50,810
He feels that both of you
can live very nicely on your salary.

1475
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:56,949
Did you tell him how much I make?

1476
01:33:57,029 --> 01:33:59,489
He's your fiance, and he asked me.

1477
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:03,729
When I told him what salary you made,
he was a little worried...

1478
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:07,829
...but then I promised him you'd get a raise,
and he felt better about it.

1479
01:34:07,899 --> 01:34:11,199
Let me tell you, mentioning that bonus
didn't do you any harm at all.

1480
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:13,800
This is terrible.

1481
01:34:14,779 --> 01:34:19,739
I'm outraged!
I had no idea he was materialistic like this.

1482
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:24,720
If you could read his letters.
Such ideals, such a lofty point of view.

1483
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:28,750
- I could quote you passages.
- For instance?

1484
01:34:31,489 --> 01:34:34,859
"True love is to be two, and yet one.

1485
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:39,229
"A man and a woman blended as angels.

1486
01:34:40,039 --> 01:34:43,060
"Heaven itself."
That's victor Hugo. He stole that.

1487
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:53,840
I thought I was the inspiration
for all those beautiful thoughts.

1488
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:58,840
Now I find he was just copying words
out of a book.

1489
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:02,489
He probably didn't mean
a single one of them.

1490
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:10,029
I'm sorry you feel this way about it.

1491
01:35:10,369 --> 01:35:12,989
I'd hate to think I'm spoiling
your Christmas.

1492
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:19,069
I'd built up such an illusion about him.
I thought he was so perfect.

1493
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:22,970
I had to come along and destroy it.

1494
01:35:23,909 --> 01:35:25,899
That's all right.

1495
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:29,210
I guess I really ought to thank you.

1496
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:35,680
Klara, if I'd only known in the beginning
how you felt about me...

1497
01:35:35,829 --> 01:35:37,789
...things would have been different.

1498
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:40,659
We wouldn't have been fighting
all the time.

1499
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:44,960
If we quarreled, it wouldn't have been
over suitcases and handbags...

1500
01:35:45,069 --> 01:35:48,470
...but over something like whether
your aunt or grandmother...

1501
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,569
...should live with us or not.

1502
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,609
It's sweet of you to try to cheer me up.

1503
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:02,770
I think we'd better say good night.

1504
01:36:04,350 --> 01:36:09,220
You have an engagement and so have l,
and we shouldn't be late.

1505
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:12,989
Do you know what I wish would happen?

1506
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:16,229
When your bell rings at 8:30,
and you open the door...

1507
01:36:16,369 --> 01:36:18,890
...instead of Popkin, I come in.

1508
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:21,930
Please, don't make it more difficult for me.

1509
01:36:22,039 --> 01:36:24,340
- I'd say, "Klara, darling"...
- No, you mustn't.

1510
01:36:24,409 --> 01:36:27,500
My dearest, sweetheart Klara,
I can't stand it any longer.

1511
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,369
Take your key
and open post office box 237...

1512
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:32,609
...and take me out of my envelope
and kiss me.

1513
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:33,939
Mr. Kralik, you must...

1514
01:36:51,529 --> 01:36:53,260
Dear friend.

1515
01:36:55,539 --> 01:36:56,529
You?

1516
01:36:58,239 --> 01:36:59,569
Dear friend?

1517
01:37:03,779 --> 01:37:05,510
Are you disappointed?

1518
01:37:12,119 --> 01:37:15,390
Psychologically, I'm very confused...

1519
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:22,750
...but personally, I don't feel bad at all.

1520
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,329
Klara.

1521
01:37:29,470 --> 01:37:34,770
When you came to the caf that night,
I was pretty rude, wasn't I?

1522
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,399
- Oh, no. No.
- Yes, I was. Don't you remember?

1523
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:41,550
Why, I called you bowlegged.

1524
01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:44,710
I was going to prove to you that I wasn't.

1525
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:48,289
I was going to go out to the street
and pull up my trousers.

1526
01:37:48,489 --> 01:37:52,149
Would you mind very much
if I asked you to pull them up now?
