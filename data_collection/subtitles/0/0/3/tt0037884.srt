1
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,299
You better take this along, Don.
It's going to be cold on the farm.

2
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,760
How many shirts are you taking?
- Three.

3
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,970
I'm taking five.
-Five?

4
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,599
Yeah, I told them at the office I might not be back
until Tuesday. We'll get there this afternoon.

5
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,477
That'll give us all Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.

6
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,562
We'll make it a long wonderful weekend.

7
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,564
Sounds long, all right.

8
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,692
It'll be good for you Don, after what you've been through.

9
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,277
Trees and grass and sweet cider and buttermilk...

10
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,781
and water from that well that's colder than any other...

11
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,866
Wick, please, why this emphasis on liquids?

12
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,077
Very dull liquids.

13
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,162
Sorry, Don.

14
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,293
You know, I think it'd be a good idea
if we took along my typewriter.

15
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,294
What for?

16
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:53,298
To write. I'm gonna write there. Get started on that novel.

17
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,385
You really feel up to writing?
-Why not?

18
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,970
I mean, after what you've been through.

19
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,389
I haven't touched the stuff for ten days now.

20
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,475
I know. I know you haven't Don.

21
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:07,187
Where is the typewriter?
-In the living room...

22
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,690
in the closet...

23
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,487
kinda towards the back.

24
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,791
Are you sure it's in the closet? I can't find it.

25
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,586
Well look by the desk.

26
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,884
Isn't it under your bed?

27
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,973
Did you find it?
-Oh sure, sure here it is.

28
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,475
And here's some paper.

29
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,187
Tell you what we'll do, we'll fix up a table
on the south porch and nobody'll disturb you.

30
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:52,191
And maybe Saturday we can run down to the Country Club.

31
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,276
I'm not going near that Country Club.
-Why not?

32
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,196
"Because they're a bunch of hypocrites
and I don't like to be whispered about "

33
00:03:57,196 --> 00:04:00,199
Look who's here from New York. The Birnam brothers...

34
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,702
or rather the nurse and the invalid.
- Oh. Stop it Don. Nobody there knows about you.

35
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,164
No? The minute we get off the train the alarm is sounded

36
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,501
The leper is back, Hide your liquor.

37
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,170
That's Helen. I'll take it. Helen.

38
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,175
Hello, Wick. Where's Don?

39
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,469
I'm glad I made it. I was afraid you'd be gone. Presents.

40
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,764
The new Thruber book, with comical jokes and pictures.

41
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,475
A nice quiet little double murder by Agatha Christie.

42
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,686
 Cigarettes, chewing gum and darling, have a wonderful time.

43
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,897
And don't forget, lots of sleep, lots of milk...

44
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:35,192
Lots of cider, lots of ice cold water from the well. I know.

45
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,069
Bend down.

46
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,701
And now I must be going. I've missed ten minutes
of the concert already. So long Wick.

47
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,870
What concert? 
-Carnegie Hall.

48
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,165
 Barbirolli conducting. They gave me two tickets at the office.

49
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,292
Who are you going with?

-Nobody.

50
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,002
Nobody?

51
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,796
What are they playing?

52
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,965
Brahms' Second Symphony, something by Beethoven...

53
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,800
somehing by Handel and not one note of Grieg.

54
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,969
Sounds wonderful.
-Goodbye, boys. See you Monday.

55
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,470
Tuesday. Wait a minute.

56
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,889
Wick, I just had a crazy idea.
-As for instance.

57
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,475
Who says we have to take the three fifteen train?

58
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,102
We could go on the six-thirty.

59
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:11,979
What are you talking about?

60
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,564
Well, I just thought we could take a later train...

61
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,900
and Helen wouldn't have to the concert by herself.
She's got two tickets, hasn't she?

62
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:22,281
No, no. I'm not going to upset any plans.
You're going on that three fifteen.

63
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,992
Oh. Now Helen, it's so silly!

64
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,077
A whale of a concert and an empty seat next to you.

65
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,871
No, Don. Everything's all set.

66
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,789
Now they'll be at the station to meet us
and dinner'll be waiting.

67
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,791
Put in a call that we're taking the later train
and have dinner at nine o'clock...

68
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,168
we'll be in bed by ten.

69
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,878
Nothing doing. We're going.

70
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,796
Wick is right. And don't worry about that empty seat.

71
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,591
I'll find myself a nice handsome
South American millionaire.

72
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:41,675
There you are. Did you hear her.

73
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,178
Besides, we'd have to break our necks anyway
to catch the train.

74
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,180
-It's five to three.
-You see?

75
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,265
Oh, don't be so stubborn Wick.

76
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,601
All right. Go ahead.

77
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,896
Just a minute. I'm not going.

78
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,689
Then what are we talking about?

79
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,482
Well, I want you to go. You and Helen.

80
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,276
Me and Helen?
-That's the idea.

81
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,196
-Who likes Brahms, you or I?
-Since when don't you like Brahms?

82
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,073
I'll just stick around here
and finish packing. Take a little nap maybe.

83
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,868
Nonsense. If anybody goes...Helen's your girl.

84
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,203
There's something in that, Don.

85
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,788
And what's more, I don't think you should be left alone.

86
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,081
-I shouldn't?
-No.

87
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,666
-I oughtn't be trusted. Is that it?
-Really, Don.

88
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,792
After what you've been through...

89
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,002
After what I've been through,
I couldn't go to a concert.

90
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,796
I couldn't even face the crowds.
I couldn't sit through it with all those people.

91
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,966
Besides, I want to be alone for a couple of hours
and kind of assemble myself.

92
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,093
Is that such an extraordinary thing to want?

93
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,262
Don't act so outraged, would you mind?

94
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,263
All right. Anything else?

95
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,973
Please, boys.

96
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,686
Come on, Helen.

97
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,064
-You'll stay right here?
-Where would I go?

98
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,565
Then you'll be here when we come back?

99
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,485
-I told you, I'm not leaving this apartment.
-You've told us a good many things, Don.

100
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,696
All right, if you don't belive me,
why don't you tak emy key and lock me in like a dog.

101
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,366
We've got to trust Don. That's the only way.

102
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,201
Sorry, Don.

103
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,203
Let's go Helen.

104
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,872
-So long, Don.
-So long.

105
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,792
Bend down.

106
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,979
-What's this?
-That? It's whiskey, isn't it?

107
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,981
-How did it get there?
-I don't know.

108
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:23,485
I suppose it dropped from some cloud. Or someone
was bouncing it against this wall and it got stuck there.

109
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,696
-I guess I must have put it there.
-Yes, you must.

110
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:26,864
Only I don't remember when.

111
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:30,492
Probably during my last spell,
maybe the one before. I don't know.

112
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,788
Don't look at me like that, Helen.
It doesn't mean a thing.

113
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,291
I didn't know it was there.
Even if I had, I wouldn't have touched it.

114
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,169
-Then you won't mind.
-Mind what?

115
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,765
Now, you trot along with Helen.

116
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,101
Why? Because of that?

117
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,896
You think I wanted you out of the apartment
because of the bottle?

118
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,397
I resent that like the devil...

119
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,690
and if there's one more word of discussion...

120
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,984
I don't leave on your blasted weekend.

121
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,570
Let's go, Wick.

122
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,368
You'll be good. Won't you, Don, darling?

123
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,163
Yes, Helen. Would you just stop watching me
all the time, you two.

124
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,665
Let me work it out my way. I'm trying, I'm trying.

125
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,375
I know you're trying, Don.

126
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,377
We're both trying.

127
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,505
You're trying not to drink...

128
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,174
and I'm trying not to love you.

129
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,597
Call the farm Don and tell them
we're taking the six-thirty.

130
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:34,890
Sure.

131
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,101
So long.

132
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,398
-Come on, Helen.
-Should Wick...

133
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,692
What if he goes out and buys another bottle?

134
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,571
With what? He hasn't a nickel. There isn't a store
or bar that'll give him five cents' worth of credit.

135
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,698
Are you sure he hasn't got
another bottle hidden someplace?

136
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,993
Not anymore, he hasn't.
I went over the apartment with a fine-toothed comb.

137
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,995
The places he can figure out!

138
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,480
Who is it? WHO IS IT?

139
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,900
Mrs. Foley. Come to clean up.

140
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,986
Well, not today. Does it have to be today?

141
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,489
I ought to change the sheets,
and it's my day to vacuum.

142
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:18,202
-Come on Monday.
-All right, Mr. Birnam. Is your brother in?

143
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,578
No, he isn't

144
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:23,874
What about my money? Didn't he leave my money?

145
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,378
-What money?
-My ten dollars. Didn't he leave it?

146
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,798
-Probably. And where would he leave it?
-In the kitchen.

147
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:36,303
-Where in the kitchen?
-In the sugar bowl.

148
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,680
Just a minute.

149
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,280
I'm sorry, Mrs. Foley.
It isn't there. He must have forgotten.

150
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,492
Oh, Putt! I wanted to do some shopping.

151
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:02,788
-You'll get it Monday.
-All right Mr. Birnam.

152
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,480
-Two bottles of rye.
-I'm sorry, Mr. Birnam.

153
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,065
What are you sorry about?

154
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:34,987
Your brother was in. He said he's not going to pay
for you anymore. That was the last time.

155
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,781
-Two bottles of rye.
-What brand?

156
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:40,701
You know what brand, Mr. Brophy. The cheapest.

157
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,787
None of that twelve year old,
aged-in-the-wood chichi. Not for me.

158
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,581
Liquor is all one, anyway.

159
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,792
-You want a bag?
-Yes, I want a bag.

160
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,588
Your brother said not to sell you anything
even if you did have the money to pay for it...

161
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:55,966
but I can't stop anybody, can I?
Not unless you're a minor.

162
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,093
I'm not a minor...

163
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:02,389
Mr. Brophy and just to ease your conscience,
I'm buying this to refill my cigarette lighter.

164
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,990
Yes, sir. Thank you.

165
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:26,205
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Deveridge.
-Hello, Mr. Birnam.

166
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:30,667
That's that nice young man who drinks.

167
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,299
How is my very good friend, Nat, today?

168
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,176
Yes, Mr. Birnam.

169
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:43,180
This being an espeically fine afternoon,
I have decided to ask for your hand in marriage.

170
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,891
-Look, Mr. Birnam...
-If that were to be your attitude, Nat...

171
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,393
I shall have to drown my sorrows
in a jigger of rye. Just one, that's all.

172
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,396
-Can't be done, Mr. Birnam.
-Can't?

173
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,898
Let me guess why.

174
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:56,276
My brother was here, undermining my financial structure.

175
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,695
I didn't tell him nothing about the wrist watch
you left here, or your cuff links.

176
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:03,075
Today, you'll be glad to know,
we can barter on a cash basis.

177
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:06,286
-One straight rye.
-That was the idea.

178
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,992
Don't wipe it away, Nat.

179
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:48,704
Let me have my little vicious circle.

180
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:52,291
You know the circle is the perfect geometric figure.

181
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,168
No end, no beginning...

182
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:57,004
-What time is it?
-Quarter of four.

183
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,673
Good. We have the whole afternoon together.

184
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:02,885
Will you let me know when it's a quarter of six.
It's very important.

185
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,888
I'm going to the country for a weekend with my brother.
You better take this along, Don. It's going to be cold on the farm.
186
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,266
Hello, Mr. Birnam.
Happy to have you back with the organization.

187
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,684
Hello, Gloria.

188
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:15,689
I wish I could take you along, Nat.
You...and all that goes with you.

189
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:19,902
Not that I'm cutting myself off from civilization altogether.

190
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,367
Now of course there arises the problem
of transportation into the country.

191
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,787
How to smuggle these two time bombs past the royal guard.

192
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:35,083
I'll roll one bottle in a copy of the Saturday Evening Post,
so my brother can discover it like that.

193
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,170
And I want him to discover it,
because that'll set his mind at ease.

194
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,506
The other bottle...Come here.

195
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,884
That one I'm tucking into my brother's suitcase.

196
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:48,180
He shall transport it himself,
without knowing it, of course.

197
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,308
Then, while he's greeting the caretaker,
I'll slide it out

198
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,603
and hide it in a hollow of the old apple tree.

199
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:58,273
Aw, Mr. Birnam, why don't you lay off
the stuff for a while?

200
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,068
Well, I may never touch it
while I'm there. Not a drop.

201
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,903
What you don't understand, all you you...

202
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:06,573
is that I've got to know it's around.
That I can have it if I need it. .

203
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,493
I can't be cut off completely. That's the devil.
That's what drives you crazy

204
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,995
Yeah. I know. I know a lot of guys like that.

205
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,206
They take a bottle and put it on the shelf.

206
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:15,707
All they want is just to look at it.

207
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,876
They won't even carry a corkscrew along,
just to make sure.

208
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,878
Then, all of a sudden...

209
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,881
they grab the bottle and bite off the neck.

210
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,177
Nat, one more reproving word
and I shall consult our lawyer about a divorce.

211
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:32,474
Now don't forget, quarter of six.
My brother must find me home, ready and packed.

212
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,104
Shall we dance?

213
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:41,775
-You're awfully pretty, Mr. Birnam.
-I bet you tell that to all the boys.

214
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,695
Why, natch. Only with you it's on the level.

215
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,199
-Yeah. Sit down.
-No thanks. Thanks a lot, but no thanks.

216
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:52,202
-There's somebody waiting. 
-Him?

217
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,496
I bet he wears arch supporters.

218
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:57,207
Oh. He's just an old friend of the folks.
Lovely gentleman.

219
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,293
He buys me dimpled Scotch.

220
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:03,088
He sould buy you Indian rubies,
and a villa in Calcutta overlooking the Ganges.

221
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,007
Don't be ridic.

222
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:05,883
Gloria, please...

223
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:09,469
why imperil our friendship
with these loathsome abbreviations.

224
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,973
I could make myself free for later on, if you want.

225
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:16,685
No Gloria, I'm going away for the weekend.
Some other time.

226
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,395
Any time.

227
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,608
Just crazy about the back of your hair.

228
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,407
Nat, weave me another.

229
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,909
You'd better take it easy.

230
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:35,496
Oh. Don't worry about me.
Just let me know when it's a quarter of six.

231
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,874
Come on, Nat. Join me. Just one little jigger of dreams.

232
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:39,791
No thanks.

233
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,377
You don't approve of drinking?

234
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,296
Not the way you drink.

235
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:48,300
It shrinks my liver, doesn't it, Nat?
It pickles my kidNeys.

236
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,595
Yes. But what does it do to my mind?

237
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:55,182
It tosses the sandbags overboard
so the balloon can soar.

238
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:58,769
Suddenly, I'm above the ordinary.
I'm competent, supremely competent.

239
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,687
I'm walking a tightrope over Niagara Falls.

240
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,898
I'm one of the great ones.

241
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,609
I'm Michelangelo molding the beard of Moses.

242
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,694
I'm Van Gogh, painting pure sunlight.

243
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,989
I'm Horowitz, playing the Emperor Concerto.

244
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:14,368
I'm John Barrymore before the movies got him by the throat.

245
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:17,371
I'm Jesse James and his two brothers, all three of them.

246
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,206
I'm W. Shakespeare.

247
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:23,585
And out there it's not Third Avenue any longer.
It's the Nile, Nat.

248
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:27,798
The Nile and down it moves the barge of Cleopatra.

249
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,092
Come here.

250
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:36,473
Purple the sails, and so perfumed
that the winds were love-sick with them.

251
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:41,478
 the oars were silver,
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke...

252
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,189
Maybe he's at Morandi's or Nat's bar...

253
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,191
or that place on Forty-second street?

254
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,277
What difference does it make?

255
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,071
-You're not really going, Wick.
-I certainly am.

256
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,074
-But you can't leave him alone. Not for four days.
-Yes I can.

257
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:57,286
Oh. For heaven's sake, Wick.
If he's left alone, anything can happen!

258
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:58,996
And I'll be tied up at the office every minute.

259
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,081
All Saturday. All Sunday. I can't look out for him.

260
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:04,209
You know how he gets. He'll be run over by a car.
He'll be arrested.

261
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,295
He doesn't know what he's doing.

262
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,589
A cigarette might fall from his mouth
and he'll burn in his bed...

263
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,091
Oh, Helen. If it happens, it happens.
And I hope it does.

264
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:15,888
 I've had six years of this. I've had my bellyful.

265
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,974
-Wick, you can't mean that.
-Yes I do.

266
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:20,893
It's terrible, I know, but I mean it.

267
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,896
-For heaven's sake, Wick...
-Who are we fooling?

268
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,399
We've tried everything, haven't we?
We've reasoned with him, we've babied him.

269
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,693
We've watched him like a hawk.
We've tried trusting him.

270
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:33,488
How often have you cried?
How often have I beaten him up?

271
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,700
We scrape him out of the gutter and...

272
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,787
pump some kind of self-respect into hims,
and back he falls, back in, every time.

273
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:43,707
He's a sick person.

274
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,376
It's as though there were something wrong
with his heart or his lungs.

275
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:50,172
You wouldn't walk out on him
because he had an attack. He needs our help.

276
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,883
He won't accept our help. Not Don. He hates us.

277
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:57,888
He wants to be alone with that bottle of his.
It's all he gives a hang about.

278
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,894
Why kid ourselves?

279
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,772
He's a hopeless alcoholic.

280
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:11,109
"The cloud-capp'd towers the gorgeous palaces."

281
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:12,694
Nat!

282
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,906
The solemn temples, the great globe itself...

283
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,283
Mr. Birnam, you ought to go home. It's late.

284
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,285
Yea, all which it inherit shall dissolve...

285
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,871
You ought to be home, on account of your brother.

286
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,289
Who says so?

287
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,000
You said so. On account of you're going away somewhere,
don't you remember?

288
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:29,169
-What time is it?
-Ten past six.

289
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:32,673
-Well, why didn't you tell me?
-What do you think I've been doing for a half an hour?

290
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:35,008
Hey, hey, your change.

291
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,798
Taxi! Taxi!

292
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,594
-I'll give you a lift as far as Grand Central.
-No thanks. I'm gonna wait here.

293
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:20,304
You're crazy.

294
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,307
Because I won't give up? Maybe I am.

295
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,809
Let go of him, Helen. Give yourself a chance.

296
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,895
Goodbye, Wick.

297
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:54,291
Don Dear: I waited for you to come home.

298
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,503
 Please be careful. Get some sleep. Eat.

299
00:22:57,503 --> 00:22:59,505
And call me, call me, call me, Helen

300
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,406
Hi.

301
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:31,286
I thought you was going away for the weekend.

302
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,793
Petes sake, what are you doing?
Come on and give me a drink!

303
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,587
Right with you, Mr. Birnam.
I'm just fixing myself some lunch.

304
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:43,173
Well, stop it and come on and give me a drink,
for heaven's sake. Come on, come on!

305
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:45,175
Okay.

306
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:50,305
-Can't you hurry it up a little?
-Here you are, Mr. Birnam.

307
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:54,685
That young lady stopped in last night, looking for ya.

308
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,188
-What young lady?
-The one with the leopard coat.

309
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,273
Yeah?

310
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,485
Yeah. She was acting like she just happened to drop in,
but I know she was making the rounds after you.

311
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:06,905
-What did you say to her?
-I said you hadn't been in for two weeks.

312
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,491
That's good. I can't let her see me.
Not now while I'm "off" like this.

313
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:10,784
Why don't you cut it short?

314
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:13,996
Don't talk like a child. You can't cut it short!

315
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:16,290
You're on that merry-go-round
and you've got to ride it all the way...

316
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,291
round and round...

317
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:20,878
till the blasted music wears itself out
and the thing dies down and clunks to a stop.

318
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:24,381
-Hey, how about you eatin' some of this?
-Take it away.

319
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,592
You gotta eat somethin' sometime.

320
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:28,510
Just give me another drink.

321
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:31,513
Mr. Birnam, this is the mornin'.

322
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:34,808
That's when you need it most, in the morning.
Haven't you learned that yet?

323
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:37,811
At night, this stuff's a drink.
In the morning, it's medicine.

324
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,313
Okay if I eat?

325
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,690
A little to one side.

326
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:47,196
Nat, are you ever scared when you wake up?

327
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:49,781
So scared the sweat starts out of ya, huh?

328
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:52,493
No, no you. With you it's simple.

329
00:24:52,493 --> 00:24:57,581
Your alarm clock goes off and you open your eye
 and brush your teeth and read the Daily Mirror. That's all.

330
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:00,584
Do you ever lie in you bed looking at the window?

331
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,878
A little daylight's coming through,
and you start to wonder:

332
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,380
is it getting lighter, is it getting darker?

333
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,591
Is it dawn or dusk?

334
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:09,593
That's a terrifying problem, Nat.

335
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:12,304
Because if it's dawn, you're dead.

336
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:16,683
The bars are closed and the liquor stores don't open
till nine o'clock, and you can't last till nine o'clock.

337
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:21,188
Or it maybe Sunday. That's the worst.

338
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:25,484
No liquor stores at all. And you guys wouldn't open a bar,
not until one o'clock. Why? Why, Nat?

339
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:29,112
Because we gotta go to church once in a while. That's why.

340
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,990
Yeah, when a guy needs it most.

341
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:34,993
What happened to those two quarts?
You polish them off last night?

342
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:38,497
-What two quarts?
-The two bottles you had.

343
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,292
That's right, I did have two bottles, didn't I?

344
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,378
I hid one of them. I've still got it.

345
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:46,213
 I'm a capitalist, Nat!

346
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:50,092
I've got untapped reserves. I'm rich!

347
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,178
If you had enough money, you'd kill yourself in a month.

348
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:54,388
Say, Nat, was there a gentleman here...

349
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:57,307
Hello, Mr. Birnam. Didn't you go away for the weekend?

350
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:58,892
Apparently not, Gloria.

351
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:01,812
-Was there a gentleman here asking for me?
-Not to my knowledge there wasn't.

352
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:03,897
Well, he was supposed to come around twelve o'clock.
He's from Albany.

353
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:07,276
-Another friend of the folks?
-More a friend of a friend of the folks type.

354
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:10,195
 A fellow called me about him.
Wants me to show him the town.

355
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:13,282
-Like Grant's Tomb for instance?
-But def.

356
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:18,912
Hey, ain't it amazing, how many guys
come down from Albany just to see Grant's Tomb?

357
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,708
Sometimes I wish you came from Albany.

358
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:23,876
Yeah? Where would you take me?

359
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:28,005
Lots of places. The Music Hall,
then the New Yorker Roof, maybe.

360
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:32,301
There is now being presented at a theatre
on Forty-Fourth Street, the uncut version of Hamlet.

361
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:35,512
Now, I see us as setting out for that. Do you know Hamlet?

362
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:37,598
I know Forty-fourth Street.

363
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:40,309
I'd like to get your interpretation of Hamlet's character.

364
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:42,186
I'd like to give it to you.

365
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:44,188
Dinner later, I think. Nothing before.

366
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:46,773
I want you to always see Shakespeare on an empty stomach.

367
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:47,774
Not even a pretzel?

368
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,402
Could I have a glass of water?

369
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,988
Why, sure. What'll it be for a chaser?

370
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,783
-This is Nat's Bar, isn't it?
-That's what the man said.

371
00:26:57,201 --> 00:27:01,205
I'm looking for a young lady, name of Gloria.

372
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:05,501
Are you Miss Gloria?

373
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:06,502
Who, me? No, I'm not.

374
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:09,087
I just live with Gloria. She's not here.

375
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,798
-She isn't?
-No, she's sick. She went to the hospital.

376
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:14,676
Ruptured appendix. Middle of last night. Went like that!

377
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,512
It scared the life out of me.

378
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:18,096
Oh, that's terrible.

379
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:20,891
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

380
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,106
Could I have a word with you?

381
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:30,901
No thanks. Thanks a lot, but no thanks.

382
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,277
Oh. You're welcome, I'm sure.

383
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:34,696
Don't mensch.

384
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:47,292
Now, Gloria. Wasn't that rather rude to send that nice man
all alone to Grant's Tomb?

385
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:50,504
When i've got a chance to go out with you? Don't be ridic.

386
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:53,799
-Oh, is our engagement definite?
-You meant it, didn't you?

387
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,801
Oh. Surely, surely.

388
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:58,178
Well, I've gotta get a facial, a fingerwave, the works.

389
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:00,389
Right now. You're going to call for me,
aren't you? And, if so, what time?

390
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,975
-What time do you suggest?
-How about eight?
-Eight's fine.

391
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:07,104
I live right in the corner house. You know
where the antique shop is, the one with the wooden Indian outside?

392
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:11,275
-They got the Indian sign in me, I always say.
-I'll be there.

393
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:14,903
Second floor, front. Oh, Mr. Birnam,
all I got is a semi-formal.

394
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:17,406
- Will that be all right?
-That'll be fine.

395
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:18,699
So long, Nat.

396
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:20,909
Last one, Nat.

397
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,579
Pour it softly, pour it gently,
and pour it to the brim.

398
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,914
Look, Mr. Birnam, there a lot of bars on Third Avenue.

399
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:29,001
Do me a favor, will ya, get out of here
and buy it somewhere else.

400
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:29,710
What's the matter?

401
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,880
I don't like you much. What was the idea of pulling her leg?
You know you're not going to take her out.

402
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,715
-Who says I'm not?
-I say so.

403
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:37,009
-You're drunk and you're just making with your mouth.
-Give me a drink.

404
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:39,887
And that other dame...I mean the lady.
I don't like what you're doing to her either.

405
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:41,180
Oh, shut up.

406
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,808
You should've seen her come in here last night. Lookin' for you
with her eyes all rainy and her mascara all washed away.

407
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,811
-Give me a drink!
-That's an awful high class young lady.

408
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,188
You bet she is.

409
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:52,399
How the heck did she ever get mixed up
with a guy who sops it up like you do?

410
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,400
That's the problem, isn't it.

411
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,486
That nice young man who drinks, and the high-class young lady,
and how did she ever get mixed up with him...

412
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:59,698
and why does he drink and why doesn't he stop?

413
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:01,492
That's my novel, Nat.

414
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:03,994
I wanted to start writing it out in the country.

415
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:05,287
Morbid stuff.

416
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:08,415
Nothing for the Book-of-the-Month Club. A horror story.

417
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:12,294
The confessions of a booze addict, the log book of an alcoholic.

418
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:16,215
Oh, come on, Nat, break down, will ya?

419
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:21,887
Do you know what I'm going to call my novel?
The Bottle...that's all. Very simply, The Bottle.

420
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:26,975
I've got it all here in my mind.
Let me tell you the first chapter.

421
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:31,313
It all starts one wet afternoon about three years ago.

422
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:35,275
There was a matinee of La Traviata at the Metropolitan.

423
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:56,476
Did you forget something?

424
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:59,813
No. Just going home, if it's all right with you.

425
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:08,697
-Say, this isn't yours, is it?
-It certainly isn't.

426
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,200
-That's what it says though...417
-I don't care what it says.

427
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:13,410
The checks must have got mixed up.
-Maybe they did.

428
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,079
Find me my coat. It's a plain man's raincoat and a derby.

429
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,916
Are you kidding? Do you know how many plain men's raincoats
we have on a day like this?

430
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,292
About a thousand.

431
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:23,378
-Well, let me get back there. I can find it.
-No. Please, that's against regulations, sir.

432
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:27,299
-I am not going to wait here until the end of the performance.
-Well, you can get your coat tomorrow.

433
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:30,886
Look, man, there's something in the pocket of that coat. I...

434
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:34,515
Well, it so happens I find myself without any money
and I need that coat. And I need it now!

435
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:37,518
Listen, if everybody went in there digging through those coats...

436
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:40,312
There's regulations. There's got to be regulations.

437
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,981
Then, what do you suggest?

438
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:46,693
-Wait till the other party arrives, then swap.
-I want my coat.

439
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:48,695
As far as I'm concerned Mister...

440
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:50,781
that's your coat.

441
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,077
You're a great help.

442
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:42,583
That's my coat you've got.

443
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,918
And that's mine, thank heaven. They mixed up the checks.

444
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:48,297
-I thought you'd never come.
-Well you couldn't have waited so long.

445
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,507
Only since the first aria of the first act. That's all.

446
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:53,594
-Do you always just drop in just for the overture?
-Goodbye.

447
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,180
Oh, oh. Just a minute!

448
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:03,395
Oh, my umbrella if you don't mind.

449
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:05,898
Catch.

450
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,692
Thank you very much.

451
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,489
I'm terribly sorry.

452
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:16,492
You're the rudest person I've ever seen.
What's the matter with you?

453
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:19,411
-Oh, just rude I guess.
-Oh, really. Somebody should talk to your mother.

454
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:22,498
-They tried, Miss St. John.
-My name's not St. John.

455
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:25,083
-Well, St. Joseph then.
-St. James.

456
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:27,586
First name Hilda or Helen, or Harriet, maybe?

457
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:29,087
Helen.

458
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:30,506
Alright, Helen.

459
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:38,680
I also know that you come from Toledo, Ohio.
-You do? How?

460
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:42,017
Well, I've had three long acts to work you out
from that coat of yours.

461
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:43,310
Initials, labels...

462
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,104
Alfred Spitzer, Fine Furs, Toledo, Ohio.

463
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:49,816
-Maybe I should have explored your coat.
-But you didn't though.

464
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,610
-Didn't have time.
-Good.

465
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:54,780
-My name is Don Birnam.
-How do you do?

466
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:58,283
-Well, how do you like New York?
-Love it.

467
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:00,994
-You intend to stay long?
-Oh, sixty years, perhaps.

468
00:36:01,203 --> 00:36:03,997
-I live here now. I've got a job.
-Doing what?

469
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:06,083
-Time Magazine.
-Oh. Time Magazine?

470
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:07,793
Then perhaps you could do something for me.

471
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:10,379
Could you help me become Man of the Year?

472
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:12,798
-Delighted. What do you do?
-Yes, what do I do?

473
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:17,094
 I'm a writer. I've just started a novel. As a matter of fact
I've started several. But, I never seem to finish one.

474
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:19,596
Well, in that case, why don't you write short stories.

475
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:22,015
Well, I have some of those. First paragraph.

476
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:25,894
Then there's one-half of the opening scene of a play
which takes place in the leaning tower of Pisa.

477
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:30,107
It tempts to explain why it leans.
And why all sensible buildings should lean.

478
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:32,192
They'll love that in Toledo.

479
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:35,779
-Oh, by the way, are you coming here to Lohengrin next week?
-I don't know.

480
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:38,407
Because if you are, I'm not going to let
this coat out of my hands.

481
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:40,993
-Don't worry.
-Oh, but I do.

482
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,787
You know, to be really safe, we should go together.

483
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:44,788
We could.

484
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:46,582
Are you in the phone book?

485
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:50,586
-Yes, but I'm not home very much.
-Well, I'll call you at your office.

486
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:56,008
Editorial Research. If Henry Luce answers, hang up.

487
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:01,180
-All right. Would you like a taxi?
-No, thanks. I'm taking the subway.

488
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:02,389
Oh, very sensible.

489
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:06,602
As a matter of fact, I'm going to an extremely crazy party
on Washington Square.

490
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:08,687
If you'll like, I'll take you along.

491
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:12,900
Oh. Thank you very much, Miss St. James,
but I have to see a friend uptown.

492
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:17,696
-Oh. Goodbye, Mr. Birnam.
-Goodbye.

493
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,001
Who threw that?

494
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,420
-It fell out of my pocket.
-Do you always carry those things?

495
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:39,384
That friend of mine, the one uptown, he has a slight cold
and I thought I'd take this along and make him a hot toddy.

496
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:42,888
-Well, see that he gets a hot lemonade and some asprin.
-I shall.

497
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,810
Bye. Oh, Miss St. James!

498
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:50,896
Yes?

499
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:54,316
-What kind of a party was that you asked me to?
-A cocktail party.

500
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:59,112
-Invitation still stand?
-Of course. Come on.

501
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,787
Okay. So they go to that cocktail party and...

502
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:09,289
he gets stinko and falls flat on his face.

503
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:10,707
He does not.

504
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:12,918
By this time, he's crazy about that girl by then.

505
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:14,503
He drinks tomato juice.

506
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:17,506
Doesn't touch liquor for that whole week...
for two weeks, for six weeks.

507
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:19,091
In love, huh?

508
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:22,386
That's what's going to be hard to write.

509
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:25,305
Love is the hardest thing in the world to write about.

510
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:26,890
 It's so simple.

511
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:29,101
You've got to catch it through details...

512
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:33,605
like the early morning sunlight hitting the gray tin
of the rainspot in front of her house.

513
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:37,401
The ringing of a telephone that sounds like Beethoven's Pastoral.

514
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:39,820
A letter scribbled on her office stationery...

515
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,615
that you carry in your pocket
because it smells of all the lilacs in Ohio.

516
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:46,618
Pour it, Nat!

517
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,998
He thinks he's cured.

518
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,710
If he could only get a job now,
they could be married and that's that.

519
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:57,504
 But it's not Nat. Not quite.

520
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:00,883
Because one day, one terrible day.

521
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:02,718
Yeah? Go on.

522
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:07,306
You see, this girl's been writing to her people in Toledo.

523
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:09,308
They want to meet the young man.

524
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:12,895
So they come to New York.
They stay at the Hotel Manhattan.

525
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:16,899
Their very first day, she's to introduce him to her parents.

526
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:20,986
One o'clock. Lobby of the hotel...

527
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:39,713
Just walked in for a simple haircut.
No, that wasn't enough, not for New York.

528
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:42,799
They gave me a shampoo, scalp massage and a manicure.

529
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:45,886
Thought they were going to tear my shoes off
and paint my toenails.

530
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:48,096
I had a lovely morning.

531
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:51,183
Just did a little window shopping.
Didn't want to get all tired out.

532
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:54,311
On account of meeting that young man? Now, Mother.

533
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:56,522
Who did you get a haircut for?

534
00:39:57,189 --> 00:39:59,316
-Wonder what's keeping Helen.
-She'll be here.

535
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:02,903
-This Birnam fellow went to Cornell, didn't he?
-I believe so.

536
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:05,280
But he never graduated. I wonder why.

537
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,407
-How old is he?
-Thirty-three.

538
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:10,285
He has no job. As far as I can find out, he never had one.

539
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:12,204
I wish Helen wasn't so vague.

540
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:15,791
Maybe he has a little money. Some people do, you know, Father.

541
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:18,710
-He ought to have a job anyway.
-He's a writer.

542
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,713
Writer? What did he write? I never heard of his name.

543
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:24,800
Now Father, relax. You always expect the worst.

544
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,302
I hope he realizes that Helen's our only daughter and

545
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:28,720
we ought to know a few things about him.

546
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,893
Those'll all come out...his background,
his prospects, his church affiliations.

547
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,312
Hotel Manhattan? Would you please page Miss Helen St. James?

548
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:21,398
St. James. Yeah, she's in the lobby.

549
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:38,916
Helen?...Don.

550
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:42,085
Darling, I'm terribly sorry
but I won't be able to get there for a while.

551
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:45,881
Will you please go ahead and have your lunch
and apologize to your parents...

552
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:50,511
Oh, nothing serious. I'll be there. Goodbye.

553
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:13,492
Turn off that light.

554
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:14,493
Don?

555
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:18,205
-Turn it off! 
-For heaven's sake, Don.

556
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:23,085
I thought you were with Helen and her father and mother.

557
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:25,712
What happened?

558
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:29,883
Come on Don.

559
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,011
-I couldn't face it.
-Couldn't face what? Didn't you go to see them?

560
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:37,099
Certainly I went. One o'clock sharp. I saw them all right.

561
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:40,102
-Only they didn't see me.
-How was that?

562
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,313
Such nice, respectable people. I couldn't face them Wick...

563
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:47,109
and all the questions they'd ask me.
I just couldn't do it. Not cold.

564
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:50,988
I had to have a drink first. Just one.
Only the one didn't do anything to me.

565
00:42:51,488 --> 00:42:54,783
So you had another and another. Oh, you poor idiot, Don.

566
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:56,285
Won't you ever learn with you,
it's like stepping off a roof

567
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:58,620
and expecting to fall just one floor?

568
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:00,414
Will you call her up Wick?

569
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:05,294
Tell her something. Tell her I'm sick.
Tell her I'm dead. Will you call?

570
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:06,920
Yes, I'll call.

571
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:09,715
You know she must have written them
a lot of nice things about me.

572
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:12,509
What a gentleman I am. A prince.

573
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:14,303
Which hotel is it?

574
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:19,892
The Manhattan. Mr. and Mrs. Charles St. James
of Toledo, Ohio.

575
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:27,900
Get up, Don.

576
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:40,120
Just a minute, Helen.

577
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:55,511
-Hello, Wick. Is Don here?
-Don? No.

578
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:57,095
Any idea where he could be?

579
00:43:57,304 --> 00:43:58,889
Wasn't he meeting you?

580
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:02,017
Oh, he was supposed to meet us for lunch,
then he telephoned he'd be late.

581
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:04,811
Mother's beginning to think I just made him up.

582
00:44:05,187 --> 00:44:08,315
-Do you suppose something happened to him?
-Nonsense.

583
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:10,192
"Oh. But surely he'd have called back
if her were all right."

584
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:12,194
-Where did he call you from?
-I don't know.

585
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:14,696
I think I have got an idea. He called from out of town.

586
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:16,907
-Out of town? Where?
-Philidelphia.

587
00:44:17,115 --> 00:44:20,619
-What's he doing in Philadelphia?
-Well, there's an opening on the Philadelphia Inquirer...

588
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:24,998
the book section and Don wrote them, he wired them
and I think this morning he just took an early train.

589
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:28,293
Oh. Why, he didn't tell me a word about it.

590
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:32,005
I, I'm not supposed to tell you either.
He wanted it to be a surprise.

591
00:44:32,214 --> 00:44:33,423
-He did?
-Yes, he...

592
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:37,386
he probably couldn't meet the right people right away,
missed a train. You know how it is.

593
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:40,722
Oh, it would be just wonderful
if he got the job and started working.

594
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:43,809
Or would it, Wick,

595
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:46,687
with him in Philadelphia and me in New York?

596
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,314
Don't ever tell him I said that though, will you?

597
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:50,899
Of course not.

598
00:44:51,316 --> 00:44:56,321
I can never understand why somebody like Don,
a person with such talent, such flashes of real brilliance...

599
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:59,408
Maybe I'm a bit prejudiced.

600
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:02,286
What are you doing, Wick?

601
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:04,705
-Nothing.
-Where did that bottle come from?

602
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:07,499
-It just rolled out.
-From under the couch.

603
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:08,709
Yes, Helen.

604
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:13,922
-You I guess that Don caught an early train and...
-Is that Don's bottle?

605
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:17,384
-What makes you think that?
-There was a bottle the first time we met.

606
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:21,013
-There was?
-Fell out of Don's pocket.

607
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:24,308
That was for me, Helen. This one's mine too.

608
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:28,687
You might as well hear the family scandal. I drink.

609
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:33,484
Don thinks I drink too much. I had to promise to go on the wagon.
That's why I hid the bottle so he wouldn't see it.

610
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:35,819
Oh. I'm so sorry, Wick.

611
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:38,113
I shouldn't have started asking questions.

612
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:40,115
It's really none of my business.

613
00:45:40,491 --> 00:45:41,992
Forget it, Helen.

614
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:44,495
I better be getting back to the hotel.

615
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:49,416
Don's probably there already. And don't worry,
Wick, I won'T mention a word of it to him.

616
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:50,709
-Thank you, Helen.
-Bye.

617
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:52,002
Bye.

618
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:58,509
Helen. I'm sorry, Helen. I can't let you go. Not like this.

619
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:01,011
Shut your mouth, Don. I'll take you downstairs.

620
00:46:01,303 --> 00:46:05,599
Thanks very much for your Philadelphia Story, Wick. Nice try.

621
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:07,684
That looks so silly on you.

622
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:10,896
-Don't listen to him.
-You don't even have to. Just look at the two of us.

623
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:13,315
Yes. What is all this covering up?

624
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:16,985
All that happened is that Don was nervous at the idea
of meeting your parents and so he took a couple of drinks.

625
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:20,322
Come on, Wick, she'd have found out sooner or later.

626
00:46:20,322 --> 00:46:22,407
Stop it, both of you.

627
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:24,785
 Don's a little tight.

628
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:27,287
Most people drink a little.
A lot of them get tight once in a while.

629
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:29,915
Sure. The lucky ones who can take it or leave it.

630
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:33,502
But then there are the ones who can't take it
and leave it either.

631
00:46:33,502 --> 00:46:35,921
What I'm trying to say is I'm not a drinker.

632
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:37,714
I'm a drunk.

633
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:39,007
They had to put me away once.

634
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:41,718
-He went to a cure.
-Which didn't take.

635
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:45,097
You see, that first time we met,
I should have had the decency to get drunk...

636
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:46,390
just for your sake.

637
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:49,685
For my sake? We're talking about you.

638
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:51,395
Is it really that bad, Wick?

639
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:52,604
Yes, it is.

640
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:55,899
Can't we go over this tomorrow, Don,
when you're feeling more like yourself?

641
00:46:55,899 --> 00:46:58,610
Helen's heard the facts. That's all there is to it.

642
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:01,488
Yes, I've heard them and they're not very pleasant.

643
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:04,825
But they could be worse. After all,
you're not an embezzler or a murderer.

644
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:06,785
You drink too much and that's not fatal.

645
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:08,912
One cure didn't take. There are others.

646
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:09,997
Of course there are.

647
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:12,124
This has a familiar ring.

648
00:47:12,124 --> 00:47:15,210
But, there must be a reason why you drink Don.
The right doctor could find it.

649
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:18,297
Look, I'm way ahead of the right doctor.

650
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:20,716
I know the reason. The reason is me. What I am.

651
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:24,219
Or, rather, what I'm not.
What I wanted to become and didn't.

652
00:47:24,386 --> 00:47:27,514
What is it you want to be so much that you're not?

653
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,601
A writer.

654
00:47:30,893 --> 00:47:33,312
Silly, isn't it?

655
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:37,691
You know, in college I passed for a genius.

656
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:41,111
They couldn't get out the college magazine
without one of my stories.

657
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:44,198
Boy, was I hot, Hemingway stuff.

658
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:46,909
I reached my peak when I was nineteen.

659
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:50,913
Sold a piece to the Atlantic Monthly.
Reprinted in the Readers' Digest.

660
00:47:50,913 --> 00:47:54,917
Who wants to stay in college when he's Hemingway?

661
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:57,002
 My mother bought me a brand new typewriter, and...

662
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:59,505
I moved right in on New York.

663
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:03,217
Well, the first thing I wrote, that didn't quite come off.

664
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:06,887
And the second, I dropped.
The public wasn't ready for that one.

665
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:10,307
I started a third and a fourth...

666
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:15,312
only by then, somebody began to look over 
y shoulder and whisper...

667
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:20,526
in a thin, clear voice like the E-string on a violin.

668
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:22,820
Don Birnam, he'd whisper...

669
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:27,491
it's not good enough. Not that way.

670
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:32,204
How about a couple of drinks just to set it on its feet, huh?

671
00:48:33,121 --> 00:48:36,917
So I had a couple. Oh, what a great idea that was.

672
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:40,587
That made all the difference.
Suddenly I could see the whole thing...

673
00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:43,799
the tragic sweep of the great novel, beautifully proportioned.

674
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:46,510
But before I could really grab it
and throw it down on paper....

675
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:50,597
the drinks would wear off
and everything would be gone, like a mirage.

676
00:48:50,806 --> 00:48:54,685
Then there was despair, and...
a drink to counterbalance despair,

677
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:57,396
and one to counterbalance the counterbalance.

678
00:48:58,397 --> 00:49:01,108
And I'd sit in front of that typewriter,

679
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:04,403
trying to squeeze out one page that was halfway decent,

680
00:49:04,987 --> 00:49:07,614
and that guy would pop up again.

681
00:49:07,906 --> 00:49:09,408
What guy? Who are you talking about?

682
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:12,911
The other Don Birnam. There are two of us, you know:

683
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:15,205
Don the drunk and Don the writer.

684
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:22,421
And the drunk would say to the writer, come on,
let's get some good out of that portable.

685
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:26,800
Let's take it to that pawn shop over on 3rd Avenue,
it's always good for U$10,

686
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,805
another drink, another binge, another bender and a spree.

687
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:34,600
Such humorous words.

688
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:40,314
I tried to break away from that guy
a lot of times but, no good.

689
00:49:40,606 --> 00:49:44,401
You know once I even got myself a gun and some bullets.

690
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:48,197
I was gonna do it on my thirtieth birthday.

691
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:50,324
Here are the bullets.

692
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:52,910
The gun went for three quarts of whiskey.

693
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:55,496
That other Don wanted us to have a drink first.

694
00:49:55,496 --> 00:49:58,790
He always wants us to have a drink first.

695
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:01,710
The flop suicide of a flop writer.

696
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:04,421
All right, maybe you're not a writer.
Why don't you do something else?

697
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:06,798
Sure, take a nice job.

698
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:09,301
Public accountant, real estate salesman.

699
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:11,512
I haven't the guts, Helen.

700
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:15,516
Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.
I can't take quiet desperation.

701
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:20,312
But you are a writer. You have every quality for it.
Imagination, wit, pity...

702
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:22,606
Come on, let's face reality.

703
00:50:22,606 --> 00:50:26,193
I'm thirty-three, I'm living on the charity of my brother.

704
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:29,696
Room and board free. Fifty cents a week for cigarettes.

705
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:32,491
An occasional ticket to a show or concert,

706
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:36,703
all out of the bigness of his heart.
And it is a big heart and a patient one.

707
00:50:36,995 --> 00:50:39,915
-I've only been carrying you along for the time being.
-Shut up, Wick

708
00:50:39,915 --> 00:50:43,418
I've never done anything, I'm not doing anything,
I never will do anything.

709
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:45,003
Zero, zero, zero.

710
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:48,298
-Now you shut up. We'll straighten it out.
-Look.

711
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:53,595
Wick has the misfortune to be my brother.
You just happened to walk in on this.

712
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:59,518
 Now if you know what's good for you, you'll turn around
and walk out again and walk fast and don't turn back.

713
00:51:03,689 --> 00:51:07,025
Why don't you make some coffee, Wick? Strong, three cups.

714
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:08,610
Look, Helen.

715
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:10,988
Do yourself a favor. Go on, clear out.

716
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:14,199
Because I've got a rival? Because you're in love with this?

717
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:15,909
You don't know me, Don.

718
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:18,620
I'm going to fight and fight and fight.

719
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,289
Bend down.

720
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:28,797
All right.

721
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:38,515
That was three years ago, Nat.

722
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:41,310
That's a long time to keep fighting, to keep believing.

723
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,188
She knows she's clutching a razor blade but she won't let go.

724
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:45,898
Three years of it.

725
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,192
And what? How does it come out?

726
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:51,028
I don't know. Haven't figured that far.

727
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:52,821
Want me to tell ya?

728
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:56,408
One day your guy gets wise to himself and gets back that gun.

729
00:51:56,408 --> 00:52:00,496
Or, if he's only got a buck then, he goes up
to the Empire State Building, way up on top and then...

730
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:04,917
or he can do it for a nickel, in a subway under a train.

731
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,793
You think so, Nat?

732
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:09,713
What if Helen is right, and this guy sits down...

733
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:12,299
and turns out something good... but good...
and that pulls him up and snaps him out of it?

734
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:14,301
This guy? Not from where I sit.

735
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,596
Oh, shut up, Nat. I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it now. It's all there. You heard it.

736
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:19,014
Yes, Mr. Birnam.

737
00:52:19,223 --> 00:52:23,018
That's why I didn't go away on that weekend, see,
so I can be alone up there and sit down at my typewriter.

738
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:25,312
This time I'm going to do it, Nat. I'm going to do it.

739
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:27,606
-Maybe you will.
-Thank you, Nat.

740
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:30,400
-Am I all paid up?
-Yes, Mr. Birnam.

741
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:31,318
Goodbye, Nat.

742
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:35,614
I'm going home. This time I've got it. I'm going to write.

743
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:39,910
Good luck to you.

744
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:50,295
THE BOTTLE A Novel by Don Birnam

745
00:52:54,508 --> 00:52:57,511
To Helen - With All My Love

746
00:54:06,914 --> 00:54:08,916
You had another bottle, you know you did.

747
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:12,794
Where did you put it? You're not crazy. Where did you put it?

748
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:34,501
It was so beautiful, so wonderful,

749
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:37,421
the stars above us shone, we were alone,

750
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:40,299
we were alone...

751
00:55:40,716 --> 00:55:42,926
Check please.

752
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:45,304
Right here, sir.

753
00:56:04,823 --> 00:56:05,908
Yes sir?

754
00:56:05,908 --> 00:56:08,410
Another gin vermouth, please.

755
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:10,996
Yes, sir.

756
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:20,524
Thank you.

757
00:57:22,693 --> 00:57:26,321
-Where's your wash room?
-Over there, sir.

758
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:35,998
-How about a carnation for your buttonhole?
-No thank you.

759
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:39,001
Thank you, sir.

760
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:42,713
Wash your hands?

761
00:57:45,007 --> 00:57:48,802
-Would you wipe my shoes?
-Yes, sir.

762
00:58:07,613 --> 00:58:09,990
-Carnation, sir?
-I already took one.

763
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:13,619
-You did?
-For a very kind lady.

764
00:58:13,827 --> 00:58:14,912
Yes, sir.

765
00:58:17,915 --> 00:58:20,209
Thank you, sir.

766
00:58:41,814 --> 00:58:43,315
That's him.

767
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:45,192
You were sitting here, sir?

768
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:47,694
I beg your pardon.

769
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:53,909
You took this lady's bag, didntcha?

770
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:55,619
All right, let's have it.

771
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,704
Of course.

772
00:58:57,996 --> 00:58:59,206
Somebody call a cop.

773
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:01,500
No, George, no. It doesn't matter as long as I have the bag.

774
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,002
Well, look in it. Maybe he took something.

775
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:05,712
Ten dollars, to be exact.

776
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:08,298
-Why I ought to kick your teeth in.
-George, George! He's drunk.

777
00:59:08,298 --> 00:59:10,300
Come on. Get out of here.

778
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:11,218
How about the check?

779
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:13,303
That's why I had to borrow from the lady.

780
00:59:13,303 --> 00:59:16,014
I didn't have enough. I'll come back and pay the rest.

781
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:18,100
Don't you show your face in here again ever.

782
00:59:18,392 --> 00:59:19,393
Mike! Take him out of here.

783
00:59:19,726 --> 00:59:23,730
Somebody stole the purse, Everybody, Somebody stole the purse

784
00:59:23,814 --> 00:59:27,109
I assure you, I'm not a thief. I'm not a thief!

785
00:59:27,317 --> 00:59:30,112
Somebody came and...

786
00:59:30,112 --> 00:59:33,407
he didn't even...

787
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:17,321
Stop it, Helen, stop it, stop it.

788
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:21,825
I'm all right. I just can't talk.

789
01:02:22,493 --> 01:02:25,496
Please, stop it.

790
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,106
You'll never make it.

791
01:03:34,314 --> 01:03:38,694
You'll never make that hock shop.
It's a block and a half away.

792
01:04:28,911 --> 01:04:31,413
This isn't Sunday, is it?

793
01:04:31,497 --> 01:04:34,208
I asked is this Sunday.
-No, Saturday. Why?

794
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:36,793
But, it's closed. Nothing else is closed.

795
01:04:37,002 --> 01:04:40,923
Somebody passed away, most likely.

796
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:35,996
What's the matter with you?

797
01:06:36,205 --> 01:06:38,415
Why are they all closed?

798
01:06:38,624 --> 01:06:40,501
They're all closed, every one of 'em.

799
01:06:40,709 --> 01:06:43,295
-Sure they are. It's Yom Kippur.
-It's what?

800
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:46,715
-It's Yom Kippur, a Jewish holiday.
-It is? What you talking about?

801
01:06:46,924 --> 01:06:50,010
-Then what about Kelly's and Gallagher's?
-They're closed too.

802
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:55,098
 We've got an agreement. They keep closed
on Yom Kippur and we don't open on St. Patrick's.

803
01:06:55,307 --> 01:07:00,729
That's a good joke. That's funny, that's very funny.

804
01:07:36,306 --> 01:07:37,516
Nat.

805
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:40,310
Yeah, Mr. Birnam?

806
01:07:41,436 --> 01:07:43,605
What do you want?

807
01:07:46,733 --> 01:07:51,196
Let me have one, Nat. I'm dying. Just one.

808
01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:53,824
I thought you was home writin' that book.

809
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:57,411
They're playing a trick on me. A dirty trick, Nat.

810
01:07:57,411 --> 01:07:59,204
Give me one.

811
01:07:59,204 --> 01:08:02,124
I'll pay it whan I can. Only just don't let me die here.

812
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:04,501
No credit, and you know it.

813
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:08,630
All right it's charity. I'm begging you. Give me one.

814
01:08:08,922 --> 01:08:10,716
Yeah, one.

815
01:08:11,008 --> 01:08:13,510
One's too many and a hundred's not enough.

816
01:08:24,897 --> 01:08:27,024
That's all.

817
01:08:27,816 --> 01:08:31,320
Oh, come on Nat, come on. I'll let you have my typewriter.

818
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:34,323
I'm no writer. You're the writer.

819
01:08:34,907 --> 01:08:37,618
-Please Nat.
-Now go, go away.

820
01:08:38,035 --> 01:08:40,621
I mean it. Get outta here.

821
01:09:36,802 --> 01:09:38,720
Who is it?

822
01:09:40,222 --> 01:09:41,807
Who is it?

823
01:09:41,807 --> 01:09:43,016
It's me.

824
01:09:45,102 --> 01:09:48,105
Why, Mr. Don Birnam, as I live and breathe!

825
01:09:48,313 --> 01:09:51,108
Only if you're comin' for our date,
you're a little late, aren't you, Mr. Birnam?

826
01:09:51,108 --> 01:09:54,319
And if you're comin' to apologize...no thanks.
Thanks a lot, but no thanks.

827
01:09:55,237 --> 01:09:58,407
Save your saliva. I've had enough of you. Def, but def.

828
01:09:58,407 --> 01:10:00,909
What do you think I am? I break a business date.

829
01:10:00,909 --> 01:10:03,328
I buy me an evening purse, a facial, a new hair-do.

830
01:10:03,537 --> 01:10:07,207
Well, maybe you can do that to your ritzy friends.
You can't to me, understand?

831
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:12,337
Okay, what do you want, Mr. Don Birnam Esquire?

832
01:10:12,629 --> 01:10:14,798
I need some money.

833
01:10:15,299 --> 01:10:16,008
You what?

834
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:18,135
Could you let me have some money?

835
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:21,722
Say, you out of your mind? Don't be ridic.

836
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:24,933
Get out of here. Make with those stairs, go on!

837
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:38,697
I waited half the night like it was the first date I ever had.

838
01:10:39,406 --> 01:10:42,701
The other half I was crying.

839
01:10:44,328 --> 01:10:46,205
How much money?

840
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:49,124
Could you let me have ten or five, or something?

841
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,503
I'll see.

842
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:06,308
You look awfully sick, Mr. Birnam.
Have you got a fever or something?

843
01:11:06,517 --> 01:11:09,436
I'm all right now.

844
01:11:09,812 --> 01:11:11,230
Thank you a lot.

845
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:13,732
You do like me a little, don't you, honey?

846
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:17,027
Why, natch, Gloria. Natch.

847
01:11:18,403 --> 01:11:20,405
Gloria, who have you got out there?

848
01:11:20,405 --> 01:11:22,324
Coming.

849
01:11:23,826 --> 01:11:27,412
It's a happy, happy, happy day...

850
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:30,517
What's this place?

851
01:12:31,018 --> 01:12:34,938
Hey, you, what is this place?

852
01:12:35,522 --> 01:12:38,609
I'm talking to you.

853
01:12:40,903 --> 01:12:44,531
Good morning, merry sunshine. How's your head?

854
01:12:44,823 --> 01:12:48,202
-Where am I? What is this place?
-This? This is the Hangover Plaza.

855
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:51,205
-What hospital is this?
-Alcoholic Ward. How's your head?

856
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:52,706
It aches.

857
01:12:52,998 --> 01:12:56,126
Thought you had a fracture till we looked at the X-rays.
Everything in one piece.

858
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:57,628
Just a slight concussion.

859
01:12:57,836 --> 01:12:59,922
Why did they put me in the Alcoholic Ward?

860
01:13:00,005 --> 01:13:03,926
Are you kiddin'? We took a peek at your blood.
Straight applejack. Ninety-six proof.

861
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:05,302
-What day is it?
-Sunday.

862
01:13:05,427 --> 01:13:08,931
Are these yours? You and the colored fellow
were being undressed at the same time.

863
01:13:09,014 --> 01:13:10,933
They fell out of somebody's pants.

864
01:13:11,099 --> 01:13:12,309
They're mine.

865
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:14,520
- Are you a doctor?
-I'm a nurse.

866
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,814
Name of Nolan. They call me Bim.

867
01:13:16,814 --> 01:13:18,524
You can call me Bim.

868
01:13:19,024 --> 01:13:21,109
-What's your name?
-Birnam.

869
01:13:21,318 --> 01:13:24,321
-What kind of Birnam?
-Don Birnam.

870
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:27,825
-Where do you live?
-Two-o-nine East Fif...

871
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:30,828
-What do you need that for?
-For the post card.

872
01:13:31,203 --> 01:13:32,204
What post card?

873
01:13:32,204 --> 01:13:35,999
To your folks, so's they'll know where honey-boy is
and can pick him up when he's feeling better.

874
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:38,335
No address.

875
01:13:38,836 --> 01:13:42,422
Okay. We'll get it out of the phone book,
or the directory, or your wallet.

876
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:46,301
Look, no postcard. Understand? Nobody's going to pick me up.

877
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:47,803
The management insists.

878
01:13:47,803 --> 01:13:50,806
If we let you guys go home alone a lot of you don't go home.

879
01:13:50,806 --> 01:13:54,101
You just hit the nearest bar and bounce right back again.

880
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:56,603
What we call the Quick Richochet.

881
01:13:56,603 --> 01:13:59,106
Look, I'm as well as you are. I can get out of here right now.

882
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:01,316
-Think so?
-Where are my clothes?

883
01:14:01,525 --> 01:14:03,527
-Downstairs.
-How do I get out of this place?

884
01:14:03,735 --> 01:14:06,405
Right through there.

885
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:22,421
Well, where do you think you're going?

886
01:14:22,629 --> 01:14:23,839
To get my clothes.

887
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:26,425
-Got you discharge?
-My what?

888
01:14:26,717 --> 01:14:30,512
-Your release?
-I'm all right. Let me out.

889
01:14:30,929 --> 01:14:31,805
Get back there, go on.

890
01:14:32,014 --> 01:14:34,808
Keep your hands off me.

891
01:14:35,225 --> 01:14:36,602
Birnam!

892
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,607
Come here, Birnam.

893
01:14:42,232 --> 01:14:43,609
Is this a jail?

894
01:14:43,817 --> 01:14:47,237
Well, this department...side of a halfway hospital, halfway jail.

895
01:14:47,404 --> 01:14:51,700
Listen, Bim, in my clothes there's five dollars.
That's all for you if only you won't send that post card.

896
01:14:52,326 --> 01:14:53,410
Nothing doing.

897
01:14:53,702 --> 01:14:54,703
I don't want anybody to know.

898
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:57,206
Your folks might as well get used to our little post cards.

899
01:14:57,206 --> 01:14:58,540
What are you talking about?

900
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:01,001
There'll be more of 'em. You'll be back.

901
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:03,128
Oh, shut up.

902
01:15:03,712 --> 01:15:05,714
Listen, I can pick an alky with one eye shut.

903
01:15:05,714 --> 01:15:07,424
You're an alky...

904
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:09,718
You'll come back. They all do.

905
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:11,136
Him, for instance,

906
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:13,931
shows up every month, just like the gas bill.

907
01:15:13,931 --> 01:15:15,724
And the one there, with the glasses,

908
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:18,310
another repeater. This is his forty-fifth time.

909
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:21,814
Big executive in the advertising business. Lovely fellow.

910
01:15:21,814 --> 01:15:24,233
 Been coming here ever since nineteen twenty-seven.

911
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:26,610
Good old prohibition days.

912
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:29,530
Say you should have seen the joint then.
This is nothing.

913
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:32,908
Back then we really had a turnover. Standing room only.

914
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:37,329
Prohibition! That's what started
most of these guys off. Whoopee!

915
01:15:37,621 --> 01:15:38,831
Now be a good boy and drink this.

916
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:40,040
I don't want it.

917
01:15:40,207 --> 01:15:41,416
Better take it.

918
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:45,712
Liable to be a little floor show later on around here.
Might get on your nerves.

919
01:15:46,129 --> 01:15:48,006
-Floor show?
-Ever have the D.T.'s?

920
01:15:48,215 --> 01:15:48,841
No.

921
01:15:48,924 --> 01:15:50,801
-You will, brother.
-Not me.

922
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:54,138
Like to make a little bet? After all, you're just a freshman.

923
01:15:54,138 --> 01:15:57,432
Wait'll you're a sophomore
that's when you start seeing the little animals.

924
01:15:57,432 --> 01:16:01,019
You know that stuff about pink elephants, that's the bunk.

925
01:16:01,019 --> 01:16:02,437
It's little animals.

926
01:16:02,521 --> 01:16:05,107
Little tiny turkeys in straw hats.

927
01:16:05,107 --> 01:16:08,318
Midget monkeys coming through the key-holes.

928
01:16:08,402 --> 01:16:10,404
See that guy over there?

929
01:16:10,737 --> 01:16:12,614
With him it's beetles.

930
01:16:12,614 --> 01:16:16,034
Come the night, he sees beetles crawling all over him.

931
01:16:16,827 --> 01:16:19,037
Has to be dark, though.

932
01:16:19,037 --> 01:16:21,123
It's like the doctor was just telling me,

933
01:16:21,331 --> 01:16:24,835
"Delirium is a disease of the night."

934
01:16:24,835 --> 01:16:28,005
Good night.

935
01:17:30,901 --> 01:17:33,737
Get the restraints and get the doctor.

936
01:18:04,434 --> 01:18:07,020
Get him to the violent ward.

937
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:12,317
Over here doctor.

938
01:18:33,422 --> 01:18:35,632
Violent ward, get the elevator.

939
01:20:36,003 --> 01:20:37,838
Good morning.

940
01:20:42,926 --> 01:20:45,012
Anything wrong up there?

941
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:47,431
Anything wrong?

942
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:51,935
-Are you all right?
-Oh. I'm fine, thank you.

943
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:55,606
-Have you been there all night?
-I've been waiting for Mr. Birnam.

944
01:20:55,731 --> 01:20:59,443
I suppose he stayed over night with some friends.
He has some friends in Long Island.

945
01:20:59,443 --> 01:21:02,905
-Now, now. What kind of story is that?
-I beg your pardon.

946
01:21:03,113 --> 01:21:05,324
I'm his landlady. I know what goes on in this house.

947
01:21:05,324 --> 01:21:07,242
I know Mr. Don Birnam.

948
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:10,829
I knew all about him the first week they moved here,
five years ago.

949
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:13,624
Heard those bottles rattle in the garbage can.

950
01:21:13,624 --> 01:21:16,335
I know all about you. You're Helen St. James.

951
01:21:16,335 --> 01:21:19,505
Your working on the Time Magazine and you're his best girl.

952
01:21:19,505 --> 01:21:23,342
 Well, I also know he's not staying
with any friends in Long Island,

953
01:21:23,342 --> 01:21:25,344
he's off on another toot and you know I'm darned right.

954
01:21:25,344 --> 01:21:27,638
Now come on down and I'll make you some breakfast.

955
01:21:27,638 --> 01:21:29,723
I don't care for any breakfast, thank you.

956
01:21:29,723 --> 01:21:32,434
Nor do I care for that kind of talk,
even supposing you're right.

957
01:21:32,434 --> 01:21:36,438
Which I am. I could have kicked him out fifty times.

958
01:21:36,438 --> 01:21:39,817
The last, when two taxi drivers dumped him
into the entrance hall out cold on the floor.

959
01:21:39,817 --> 01:21:43,028
With all my tennants going in and out
and children leaving for school.

960
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,614
-Please, please.
-Well, I didn't put him out.

961
01:21:45,614 --> 01:21:50,118
 Not as long as his brother could pay the rent.
You couldn't help liking him anyway.

962
01:21:50,118 --> 01:21:53,413
He's was so good looking. He had such nice manners.
He always had a little joke.

963
01:21:53,622 --> 01:21:56,041
Stop talking about him as if he were dead.

964
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:59,503
Best thing for you if he was.

965
01:22:58,604 --> 01:23:00,606
I want a quart of rye. Quick.

966
01:23:00,814 --> 01:23:03,817
-Care if I take off my coat first?
-No.

967
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:09,531
No cracks, no questions. Just a quart of rye.

968
01:23:18,832 --> 01:23:19,833
Be two fifteen.

969
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:24,838
Come on. I need that liquor, I want it,
I'm going to get it, understand.

970
01:23:25,005 --> 01:23:30,219
I'm going to walk out of here with that quart of rye,
one way or another.

971
01:26:02,412 --> 01:26:03,413
Miss St. James?..

972
01:26:03,413 --> 01:26:06,625
He's back. He's upstairs, this is Mrs. Deveridge.

973
01:26:07,042 --> 01:26:08,919
Yes, he's back. Up in the apartment.

974
01:26:08,919 --> 01:26:11,713
I heard him yelling.

975
01:26:23,725 --> 01:26:26,311
Don, open the door. Open it, please.

976
01:26:28,021 --> 01:26:32,025
Don, won't you let me in? I know you're there.
Please, open the door.

977
01:26:34,111 --> 01:26:36,822
Don, don't you hear me? I want to help you.

978
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,908
Don, I won't go away.

979
01:26:40,117 --> 01:26:43,912
Do I have to go down and get the janitor
with the pass key to let me in?

980
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:50,419
Dave! Dave!

981
01:26:50,419 --> 01:26:52,212
Yes, Mrs. Deveridge?

982
01:26:52,212 --> 01:26:55,132
Come on up with the pass key. Come on, come on, come.

983
01:27:47,017 --> 01:27:48,143
Thank you very much.

984
01:27:48,143 --> 01:27:52,314
-You'd better let us come too. You can't go in there alone.
-I'll be all right, thank you.

985
01:27:52,606 --> 01:27:55,025
Come Sophie. Let's go.

986
01:28:04,326 --> 01:28:06,537
-Don, darling.
-Go away, Helen.

987
01:28:06,537 --> 01:28:08,539
I'm here to help you, Don.

988
01:28:08,539 --> 01:28:09,540
No, no.

989
01:28:10,916 --> 01:28:12,709
Look at you.

990
01:28:13,043 --> 01:28:17,131
You want to get up, Don. Put your arm on my shoulder.

991
01:28:31,436 --> 01:28:35,816
You'll have a bath and I'll help you shave
and you'll eat and sleep,

992
01:28:35,816 --> 01:28:39,027
and when Wick comes back everything will be all right.

993
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:40,946
No, Helen, don't look.

994
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:43,240
What's the matter, Don?

995
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,825
-That wall.
-What wall?

996
01:28:44,908 --> 01:28:48,036
-The mouse and the bat.
-Mouse and the bat?

997
01:28:48,245 --> 01:28:51,707
Yes, that hole in the wall right behind you.

998
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:56,712
-There's no hole in the wall, Don.
-Yes there is.

999
01:28:57,045 --> 01:29:00,007
Don please, look for yourself. Come on.

1000
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:03,010
Come on Don, please look.

1001
01:29:16,148 --> 01:29:17,441
You see?

1002
01:29:21,612 --> 01:29:24,114
Everything's gonna be all right.
I'll stay right with you.

1003
01:29:24,114 --> 01:29:28,327
It's little animals. It's always little animals.

1004
01:29:28,327 --> 01:29:30,537
That's what Bim said.

1005
01:29:31,038 --> 01:29:33,707
You're not making much sense Don.

1006
01:29:33,707 --> 01:29:36,418
You know what Nat said about the ending?

1007
01:29:37,044 --> 01:29:39,213
Like this.

1008
01:29:39,838 --> 01:29:41,423
Or like that.

1009
01:29:42,007 --> 01:29:45,010
Like this or like that.

1010
01:30:13,831 --> 01:30:15,916
Don! Don!

1011
01:30:23,423 --> 01:30:25,134
Where are you going, Don? Don.

1012
01:30:45,612 --> 01:30:47,531
All right, Don. Give me the pawn ticket.

1013
01:30:47,531 --> 01:30:50,117
-No scene, please.
-No scene. Just give me the pawn ticket.

1014
01:30:50,242 --> 01:30:52,411
Look, I don't want you to go in there and claim it now.
It would look queer.

1015
01:30:52,411 --> 01:30:55,330
You're ashamed of what the pawn broker will think,
is that it? It doesn't matter what I think.

1016
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:56,915
Wick'll get you back your coat.

1017
01:30:56,915 --> 01:31:00,627
You couldn't have taken my bracelet or my pay check?
It had to be that coat?

1018
01:31:00,919 --> 01:31:03,422
You mean the one that brought us together?
Stop being sentimental.

1019
01:31:03,839 --> 01:31:06,925
Oh, I have Don, I assure you. It's finished. It's dead.

1020
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:10,929
 For three years they couldn't talk me out of you.
I was the only one that really understood you.

1021
01:31:10,929 --> 01:31:15,017
I knew there was a core of something...
well there is a core, and now I know what it is.

1022
01:31:15,017 --> 01:31:16,310
A sponge.

1023
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:19,521
And to soak it full you'll do anything
that's ruthless, selfish, dishonest.

1024
01:31:19,521 --> 01:31:21,440
-I asked you not to make a scene.
-Then give me the ticket.

1025
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,025
No, Helen, not now, please.

1026
01:31:23,025 --> 01:31:26,528
I don't want the money. You can get as drunk
as you like for all I care.

1027
01:31:27,237 --> 01:31:28,822
Thank you.

1028
01:31:39,625 --> 01:31:42,211
A gentleman was here a while ago.
How much did you give him for that coat?

1029
01:31:42,211 --> 01:31:44,546
-Why?
-Well, I want it back. It's my coat.

1030
01:31:45,047 --> 01:31:47,633
-It's your coat?
- He had my permission. How much did you give him?

1031
01:31:47,633 --> 01:31:49,843
He didn't want any money. He wanted to swap it.

1032
01:31:49,843 --> 01:31:51,011
Swap it? For what?

1033
01:31:51,345 --> 01:31:54,139
Oh, something he hocked here a long while back.

1034
01:31:54,348 --> 01:31:56,934
A gun.

1035
01:31:58,143 --> 01:32:01,230
A gun?

1036
01:32:02,231 --> 01:32:04,733
Now if you want that coat I can a...

1037
01:32:05,943 --> 01:32:08,946
As for the survivors, dear old Wick,

1038
01:32:09,446 --> 01:32:13,617
I'd recommend no flowers, and few good jokes.

1039
01:32:14,117 --> 01:32:16,411
Goodbye, Don.

1040
01:33:05,127 --> 01:33:07,129
What is it, Helen?

1041
01:33:09,423 --> 01:33:11,049
What's the matter?

1042
01:33:14,344 --> 01:33:16,513
Nothing.

1043
01:33:16,722 --> 01:33:19,850
Dave gave me the keys, I didn't think you were here.

1044
01:33:22,019 --> 01:33:23,937
What do you want here?

1045
01:33:24,146 --> 01:33:28,317
It's just that the rain is worse
and I couldn't get a taxi. I thought perhaps I could borrow a...

1046
01:33:28,317 --> 01:33:30,110
a coat under the circumstances.

1047
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:33,322
Sure. How about my raincoat?

1048
01:33:38,535 --> 01:33:42,247
Funny, that we should wind up
after all these years just as we met,

1049
01:33:42,247 --> 01:33:45,626
-I with your raincoat...
-And I with your leopard coat.

1050
01:33:45,709 --> 01:33:48,212
I always got the best of the bargain.

1051
01:33:48,545 --> 01:33:50,422
Goodbye, Helen.

1052
01:33:52,633 --> 01:33:54,426
What are you looking for?

1053
01:33:55,219 --> 01:33:57,721
Well I thought perhaps,
maybe you might have something for my hair.

1054
01:33:58,013 --> 01:34:02,017
-Would you care to wear my black derby?
-Any old thing, any old scarf.

1055
01:34:02,226 --> 01:34:03,227
All right.

1056
01:34:19,326 --> 01:34:20,536
Here you are.

1057
01:34:20,744 --> 01:34:21,620
Thank you.

1058
01:34:21,829 --> 01:34:23,247
So long.

1059
01:34:24,748 --> 01:34:27,709
Do you know Don, there was still some whiskey left
in the bottle after I cleaned up last night.

1060
01:34:28,043 --> 01:34:28,919
Was there?

1061
01:34:29,211 --> 01:34:31,630
-Wouldn't you like to know where I put it?
-Nope.

1062
01:34:31,922 --> 01:34:34,842
-Don't you want a drink, Don?
-No.

1063
01:34:37,219 --> 01:34:41,640
Here it is, right here. Why don't you have one. Just one.

1064
01:34:42,015 --> 01:34:43,433
What are you up to?

1065
01:34:44,143 --> 01:34:45,435
Nothing.

1066
01:34:45,435 --> 01:34:47,521
 I'm just ashamed of the way I talked to you,

1067
01:34:47,521 --> 01:34:50,649
like a narrow-minded, insensitive,
small-town teetotaller.

1068
01:34:50,941 --> 01:34:52,818
I told you, I don't feel like a drink. Not now.

1069
01:34:52,818 --> 01:34:54,444
Come on, Don. Just one.

1070
01:34:54,444 --> 01:34:57,239
I'll have one with you. I'm in no hurry.
This is my easy day at the office.

1071
01:34:57,531 --> 01:35:00,742
Look Helen, there are a few things
I want to put in order before Wick comes.

1072
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:04,830
-Let me stay please.
-No.

1073
01:35:06,832 --> 01:35:09,918
I don't want to sound rude but,
I'm afraid you'll have to leave now.

1074
01:35:10,711 --> 01:35:13,213
Here Don.

1075
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:15,549
You're very sweet.

1076
01:35:17,426 --> 01:35:19,511
Goodbye.

1077
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:22,848
Don't let me bend for nothing.

1078
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:27,227
You need this, Don. Drink it. I want you to drink it.
I'll get you some more. I'll get you all you want.

1079
01:35:27,436 --> 01:35:29,521
What kind of talk is that?

1080
01:35:29,813 --> 01:35:33,734
It's just that I'd rather have you drunk than dead.

1081
01:35:34,735 --> 01:35:36,445
Who wants to be dead?

1082
01:35:36,612 --> 01:35:38,822
Stop lying to me.

1083
01:35:41,116 --> 01:35:43,327
Give it to me.

1084
01:35:48,415 --> 01:35:49,833
All right. Now go!

1085
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:52,711
No fuss, please. No calling the neighbors.
It won't do any good, I promise you.

1086
01:35:53,045 --> 01:35:55,339
I won't. You've made up your mind.

1087
01:35:55,839 --> 01:35:57,716
But could you tell me why? Why?

1088
01:35:57,716 --> 01:35:59,843
Because it's best all around, for everybody.
For you, for Wick, for me.

1089
01:35:59,843 --> 01:36:03,639
-But that's not true. We love you, Wick and I.
-All right. Then for me.

1090
01:36:03,639 --> 01:36:05,140
Selfish again.

1091
01:36:05,349 --> 01:36:06,934
That's a sad final word, Don.

1092
01:36:06,934 --> 01:36:10,229
Look at it this way, Helen. This business is just a formality.
Don Birnam is dead already.

1093
01:36:10,437 --> 01:36:13,315
-He died over this weekend.
-Did he? What did he die of?

1094
01:36:13,524 --> 01:36:14,733
Of a lot of things.

1095
01:36:14,733 --> 01:36:18,821
Of alcohol, of moral anemia, of fear, of shame, of D.T.'s.

1096
01:36:19,238 --> 01:36:22,741
Oh, that Don Birnam. And now you want to kill the other one.

1097
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:23,450
What other?

1098
01:36:23,617 --> 01:36:26,912
There were two Dons. You told me so yourself.
Don the drunk and Don the writer.

1099
01:36:26,912 --> 01:36:32,042
Let's not go back to a fancy figure of speech.
There's only one Don, he's through.

1100
01:36:32,918 --> 01:36:33,627
Don.

1101
01:36:34,128 --> 01:36:36,338
I'm all right, I have enough strength left...

1102
01:36:36,547 --> 01:36:40,217
I know you have. I can see it.
Don't waste it on pulling a trigger, Don.

1103
01:36:40,217 --> 01:36:43,512
No, let me get it over with or do you want me to give you
another one of my promises that I never keep?

1104
01:36:43,512 --> 01:36:48,016
I don't want you to give me your promise,
I don't want you to give your promise to anybody but Don Birnam.

1105
01:36:48,016 --> 01:36:50,144
It's too late. I wouldn't know how to start.

1106
01:36:50,144 --> 01:36:54,231
The only way to start is to stop.
There is no cure besides just stopping.

1107
01:36:54,439 --> 01:36:56,441
-Can't be done.
-Other people have stopped.

1108
01:36:56,525 --> 01:36:58,735
People with a purpose, with something to do.

1109
01:36:58,735 --> 01:37:00,529
You've got talent and ambition.

1110
01:37:00,529 --> 01:37:04,032
Talent. Ambition. That's dead long ago.
That's drowned.

1111
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:06,827
That's drifting around
with a bloated belly on a lake of alcohol.

1112
01:37:07,035 --> 01:37:08,912
No it isn't. You still have it.

1113
01:37:09,121 --> 01:37:11,123
Quit trying to stall me Helen. It's too late.

1114
01:37:11,123 --> 01:37:13,750
There's no more writing left in me,
it's gone. What do you expect, a miracle?

1115
01:37:13,834 --> 01:37:14,251
Yes,

1116
01:37:14,251 --> 01:37:16,712
Yes, yes! If I could just make you...

1117
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:18,922
-Who is it?
-It's me, Mr. Birnam.

1118
01:37:18,922 --> 01:37:22,926
-What is it, Nat?
-I got somethin' for you, Mr. Birnam.

1119
01:37:26,221 --> 01:37:28,015
-I hope I ain't intrudin.
-What is it?

1120
01:37:28,515 --> 01:37:30,225
You know when you had that accident?

1121
01:37:30,225 --> 01:37:33,228
Afterward I found this floatin' around on the Nile.

1122
01:37:33,228 --> 01:37:35,230
She writes pretty good. I oiled her up a little.

1123
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:38,525
And I didn't oil her up so you can hock her.

1124
01:37:39,735 --> 01:37:42,321
-I'll take it, Nat.
-Hello, Miss.

1125
01:37:43,447 --> 01:37:44,448
Thank you, Nat.

1126
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,951
How are all them lilacs in Ohio?

1127
01:37:50,746 --> 01:37:52,623
Well Don, here it is. What do you say now?

1128
01:37:53,123 --> 01:37:55,042
-Say about what?
-This.

1129
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:58,045
Someone, somewhere, sent it back.
Why? Because he means you to stay alive,

1130
01:37:58,045 --> 01:38:00,839
because he wants you to write.
I didn't ask for a big miracle.

1131
01:38:01,048 --> 01:38:03,842
Write! With these hands?
And a brain that's all out of focus?

1132
01:38:03,842 --> 01:38:04,927
It'll clear up again. You'll be well.

1133
01:38:04,927 --> 01:38:07,721
And I'll be sitting there staring at that white sheet, scared.

1134
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:10,516
No you won't. You've forgotten what it feels like to be well.

1135
01:38:10,724 --> 01:38:14,436
-What am I gonna write about? What?
-What you've always wanted to write.

1136
01:38:14,645 --> 01:38:16,522
Where was the page I found?

1137
01:38:16,939 --> 01:38:19,024
"The Bottle. A Novel by Don Birnam,"

1138
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:20,526
What was that to be?

1139
01:38:20,526 --> 01:38:23,612
About a messed-up life. About a man and a woman and a bottle.

1140
01:38:23,612 --> 01:38:27,032
About nightmares, horrors, humiliations,
all the things I want to forget.

1141
01:38:27,449 --> 01:38:29,952
Put it all down on paper. Get rid of it that way.

1142
01:38:29,952 --> 01:38:31,745
Tell it all, to whom it may concern.

1143
01:38:31,745 --> 01:38:34,122
And it concerns so many people, Don.

1144
01:38:34,331 --> 01:38:35,624
Yeah.

1145
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:38,836
I'll fix us some breakfast.

1146
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:43,132
We have quite a supply of milk.

1147
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:47,553
You'll notice I didn't even find a first line.

1148
01:38:47,719 --> 01:38:50,639
Course you couldn't write the beginning
because you didn't know the ending.

1149
01:38:50,848 --> 01:38:53,142
Only now...

1150
01:39:09,449 --> 01:39:12,536
Only now you know the ending.

1151
01:39:14,121 --> 01:39:20,252
I'm gonna send one copy to Bim,
one to the doctor who loaned me his coat, and one to Nat.

1152
01:39:21,044 --> 01:39:23,922
 Imagine Wick standing in front of a book store.

1153
01:39:23,922 --> 01:39:26,216
A great big pyramid of my books.

1154
01:39:26,425 --> 01:39:28,218
A Novel by Don Birnam.

1155
01:39:28,218 --> 01:39:30,637
"That's by my brother, you know."

1156
01:39:30,721 --> 01:39:33,140
That's by my fellow. Didn't I always tell you?

1157
01:39:33,348 --> 01:39:36,351
I'm going to put this whole weekend down, minute by minute.

1158
01:39:36,518 --> 01:39:37,436
Why not?

1159
01:39:37,853 --> 01:39:40,814
The way I stood in there, packing my suitcase...

1160
01:39:40,814 --> 01:39:43,650
Only my mind wasn't on the suitcase,

1161
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:45,944
and it wasn't on the weekend,

1162
01:39:45,944 --> 01:39:49,615
nor was it on the shirts I was putting in the suitcase either.

1163
01:39:50,032 --> 01:39:53,118
My mind was hanging outside the window.

1164
01:39:53,327 --> 01:39:56,914
It was suspended just about eighteen inches below...

1165
01:39:57,915 --> 01:40:00,918
And out there in that great big concrete jungle,

1166
01:40:00,918 --> 01:40:03,921
I wonder how many others that are like me.

1167
01:40:03,921 --> 01:40:07,633
Poor bedevilled guys, on fire with thirst.

1168
01:40:07,841 --> 01:40:12,221
Such comical figures to the rest of the world,
as they stagger blindly...

1169
01:40:12,221 --> 01:40:16,642
towards another binge, another bender, another spree...

1170
01:40:22,648 --> 01:40:24,942
