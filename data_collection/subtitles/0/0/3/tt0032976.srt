00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,200
<i>[ Woman ] Last night</i>
<i>I dreamt I went to Manderley again.</i>

2
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,600
<i>It seemed to me I stood by the</i>
<i>iron gate leading to the drive,</i>

3
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,000
<i>and for a while</i>
<i>I could not enter...</i>

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,080
<i>for the way was barred to me.</i>

5
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,800
<i>Then, like all dreamers,</i>

6
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,320
<i>I was possessed of a sudden</i>
<i>with supernatural powers...</i>

7
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,080
<i>and passed like a spirit</i>
<i>through the barrier before me.</i>

8
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,000
<i>The drive wound away</i>
<i>in front of me,</i>

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,320
<i>twisting and turning</i>
<i>as it had always done.</i>

10
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,120
<i>But as I advanced, I was aware</i>
<i>that a change had come upon it.</i>

11
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,600
<i>Nature had come</i>
<i>into her own again,</i>

12
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,880
<i>and little by little</i>
<i>had encroached upon the drive...</i>

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
<i>with long, tenacious fiingers.</i>

14
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,720
<i>On and on wound the poor thread</i>
<i>that had once been our drive,</i>

15
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,400
<i>and fiinally</i>
<i>there was Manderley.</i>

16
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,920
<i>Manderley--</i>
<i>secretive and silent.</i>

17
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,920
<i>Time could not mar the perfect</i>
<i>symmetry of those walls.</i>

18
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,280
<i>Moonlight can play</i>
<i>odd tricks upon the fancy,</i>

19
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,800
<i>and suddenly it seemed to me that light</i>
<i>came from the windows.</i>

20
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,200
<i>And then a cloud</i>
<i>came upon the moon...</i>

21
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,600
<i>and hovered an instant</i>
<i>like a dark hand before a face.</i>

22
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,000
<i>The illusion went with it.</i>

23
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,400
<i>I looked upon</i>
<i>a desolate shell...</i>

24
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,680
<i>with no whisper of the past</i>
<i>about its staring walls.</i>

25
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,480
<i>We can never</i>
<i>go back to Manderley again.</i>

26
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,400
<i>That much is certain.</i>

27
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,880
<i>But sometimes in my dreams...</i>

28
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,320
<i>I do go back to the strange</i>
<i>days of my life...</i>

29
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,920
<i>which began for me</i>
<i>in the South of France.</i>

30
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,520
<i>No! Stop!</i>

31
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,880
What the devil
are you shouting about ?

32
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,720
Who are you ?
What are you staring at ?

33
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,080
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare.
But I, I only thought--

34
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,880
Oh, you did, did you ?
Well, what are you doing here ?

35
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,800
I was only walking.

36
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,320
Well, get on with your walking.
Don't hang about here screaming.

37
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll never come to Monte Carlo
out of season again.

38
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,200
Not a single well-known
personality in the hotel.

39
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,600
Stone cold ! Waiter.
G<i>arcon.</i> Call him.

40
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Tell him to get me some--

41
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,920
<i>Why, it</i>'<i>s Ma</i>x <i>de Winter.</i>
<i>How do you do ?</i>

42
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,000
- How do you do ?
- I'm Edith Van Hopper.

43
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,080
It's so nice
to run into you here,

44
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,400
just when I was beginning to despair of
fiinding any old friends here in Monte.

45
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,680
But do sit down
and have some coffee.

46
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,200
Mr. de Winter is having coffee with me.
Ask that stupid waiter for another cup.

47
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,800
I'm afraid I must contradict you.
You shall both have coffee with me.

48
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,920
- G<i>arcon.</i> Coffee, please.
<i>- Oui, monsieur.</i>

49
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,800
- A cigarette ?
- No, thank you.

50
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,480
You know, I recognized you
just as soon as you came in,

51
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,080
though I haven't seen you since
that night at the casino at Palm Beach.

52
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,000
Perhaps you don't remember
an old woman like me.
Are you playing the tables much here ?

53
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,800
No, I'm afraid that sort of thing
ceased to amuse me years ago.

54
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,280
I can well understand that.
As for me,

55
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,400
if I had a home like Manderley,
I should certainly never come to Monte.

56
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,120
<i>It</i>'<i>s one of the biggest places</i>
<i>in that part of the country, and</i>
<i>you can</i>'<i>t beat it for beauty.</i>

57
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,600
What do you think of Monte Carlo ?
Or don't you think of it at all ?

58
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,720
Oh, well,
I think it's rather artifiicial.

59
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,400
She's spoiled, Mr. de Winter.
That's her trouble.

60
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,080
Most girls would give their eyes
for a chance to see Monte.

61
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,600
Wouldn't that rather
defeat the purpose ?

62
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,920
Now that we've found each other again,
I hope I shall see something of you.

63
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,920
<i>You must come</i>
<i>and have a drink in my suite.</i>
<i>I hope they</i>'<i>ve given you a good room.</i>

64
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,120
<i>The place is empty. So if you</i>'<i>re</i>
<i>uncomfortable, mind you, make a fuss.</i>

65
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,520
Your valet has unpacked for you,
I suppose ?

66
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,200
I'm afraid I don't possess one.
Perhaps you'd like to do it for me ?

67
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,920
Well, I, I hardly think--

68
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,520
Perhaps you could make
yourself useful to Mr. de Winter
if he wants anything done.

69
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,600
You're a capable child in many ways.

70
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,480
That's a charming suggestion,
but I'm afraid I cling to the old motto:

71
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,720
'' He travels fastest
who travels alone.''

72
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,120
Perhaps you've not heard of it.
Good night.

73
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,600
What do you make of that ?

74
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
<i>Do you suppose that sudden departure</i>
<i>was intended to be funny?</i>

75
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,600
Come, don't sit there gawking.
Let's go upstairs.

76
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,680
- Have you got the key ?
- Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.

77
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,600
I remember when I was younger
there was a well-known writer...

78
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,520
who used to dart down the back
way whenever he saw me coming.

79
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,000
I suppose he was in love with me
and wasn't quite sure of himself.

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,400
Well, <i>c</i>'<i>est la vie.</i>

81
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,200
By the way, my dear,
don't think that I mean to be unkind,

82
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,200
but you were just a teeny, weeny bit
forward with Mr. de Winter.

83
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,320
Your effort to enter
the conversation...

84
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,600
quite embarrassed me,
and I'm sure it did him.

85
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Men loathe that sort of thing.
Oh, come. Don't sulk.

86
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,720
After all, I am responsible
for your behavior here.

87
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,520
Perhaps he didn't notice it.
Poor thing !

88
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,480
I suppose he just can't
get over his wife's death.

89
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,200
They say he simply adored her.

90
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,680
<i>Oui.</i>
[ Speaking French ]

91
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,720
Oh ! How awkward of me.

92
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,600
<i>What a stupid thing to do.</i>
<i>Oh, I</i>'<i>m so sorry.</i>

93
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,920
<i>Please don</i>'<i>t bother.</i>
<i>It doesn</i>'<i>t really matter.</i>

94
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,600
Leave that. Leave that.
Go and lay another place at my table.

95
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,520
- Mademoiselle will have lunch with me.
- Oh, but I couldn't possibly.

96
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,200
- Why not ?
- Oh, please don't be polite.
It's very kind of you,

97
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,000
- but I'll be all right if
they just change the cloth.
- I wasn't being polite.

98
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,800
I should have asked you to have
lunch with me even if you hadn't
upset the vase so clumsily.

99
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,920
Come along. We needn't talk to
each other if we don't feel like it.

100
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,800
Thank you very much.

101
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,200
Oh, I'll just ha-have
s-some scrambled eggs.

102
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
<i>Oui, mademoiselle.</i>

103
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,600
What's happened to your friend ?

104
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,520
Oh, she's ill in bed with a cold.

105
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,600
I'm sorry
I was so rude to you yesterday.

106
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,080
The only excuse I can offer is that I've
become boorish through living alone.

107
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,800
You weren't really.
You simply wanted to be alone, and--

108
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Tell me, is Mrs. Van Hopper
a friend of yours or just a relation ?

109
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,800
No, she's my employer.
I'm what is known as a paid companion.

110
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,000
I didn't know companionship
could be bought.

111
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,080
I looked up the word ''companion''
in the dictionary once.

112
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
It said,
''a friend of the bosom.''

113
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,320
[ Chuckles ]
I don't envy you the privilege.

114
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,600
Oh, she's very kind, really,
and I have to earn my living.

115
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,280
-Haven't you any family ?
-No, my mother died years and years ago,

116
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,000
and then there was only my father.

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,400
And he died last summer,
and then I took this job.

118
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,200
- How rotten for you.
- Yes, it was rather,

119
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,880
because, you see,
we got on so well together.

120
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,800
You and your father ?

121
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
Yes. He was a lovely person--
very unusual.

122
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
- What was he ?
- A painter.

123
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,120
- Ah. Was he a good one ?
- Well, I thought so.

124
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
But people didn't understand him.

125
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
Yes, that's often the trouble.

126
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,120
He painted trees.
At least it was one tree.

127
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,920
You mean he painted the same
tree over and over again ?

128
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,120
Yes. You see, he had a theory that
if you should fiind one perfect thing...

129
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,520
or place or person,
you should stick to it.

130
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,400
Do you think that's very silly ?

131
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,800
Not at all.
I'm a fiirm believer in that myself.

132
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,000
And what did you fiind
to do with yourself
while he was painting his tree ?

133
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,080
Oh, I sat with him and I sketched
a little. I don't do it well, though.

134
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,480
-You're going sketching this afternoon ?
-Yes.

135
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,400
- Where ?
- I haven't made up my mind.

136
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,400
- I'll drive you somewhere in the car.
- Oh, no, please. I didn't mean--

137
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,200
Oh, nonsense.
Finish up that mess and we'll get along.

138
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,120
Thank you. It's very kind of you,
but I'm not very hungry.

139
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,080
Oh, come on.
Eat it up like a good girl.

140
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,120
You're taking
long enough for that sketch.
I expect a really fiine work of art.

141
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,680
Oh, no, don't look at it.
It's not nearly good enough.

142
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,600
But it can't be
as bad as all that.

143
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,520
Now, don't rub it all out.
Let me look at it fiirst.

144
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,080
- It's the perspective.
I never can get it right.
- Let me see.

145
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,400
Oh, dear.
Tell me, is it the perspective...

146
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,120
<i>that gives my nose that</i>
<i>curious twist in the middle ?</i>

147
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,680
- Well, you're not
a very easy subject to sketch.
- No ?

148
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,800
- Your expression
keeps changing all the time.
- Does it ?

149
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,680
Well, I'd concentrate on the view
instead if I were you.

150
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,800
Much more worthwhile.

151
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,280
It rather reminds me of our coastline
at home. Do you know Cornwall at all ?

152
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,200
Yes. I went there once
with my father on holiday.

153
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,600
I was in a shop once,
and I saw a postcard...

154
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,200
with a beautiful house on it,
right by the sea.

155
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,800
And I asked whose house it was, and
the old lady said, ''That's Manderley.''

156
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,600
- I felt ashamed for not knowing.

[Jasper Barking, Howling ]

631
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,880
That's Jasper. There must be something
wrong. Perhaps he's hurt himself.

632
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,520
-No, he's all right.
-Don't you think I'd better go and see ?

633
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,680
Don't bother about him.
He can't come to any harm.
He'll fiind his own way back.

Come on. Come on home.

Let's go home. Jasper. Jas--

640

Oh... I didn't know
that there was anybody--

641
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,400
I know that dog.
He comes fr' the house.

He ain't your'n.

No, he's
Mr. de Winter's dog.

Have you anything
I could tie him with ?

Come on,Jasper.

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,720
You won't tell anyone
you saw me in there, will ya ?

647

Don't you belong
on the estate ?

I was just puttin'
my shells away.

You knew I didn't
want you to go there,
but you deliberately went.

658
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,400
Why not ?
There was only a cottage
down there and a strange man--

659
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,800
You didn't go into
the cottage, did you ?
Yes. The door--

660
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,480
Well, don't go there
again, do you hear !
Well, why not ?

661
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,400
If you had my memories,
you wouldn't go there
or even think about it !

662
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,200
What's the matter ?
Oh, I'm sorry. Please.

663
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:22,400
We should have stayed away.
We should never have come
back to Manderley.

664
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,080
Oh, what a fool I was !

665
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,600
I've made you unhappy.
Somehow I've hurt you.

666
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,600
Oh, I can't bear
to see you like this...

667
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,200
because I love you so much.

668
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,680
Do you ? Do you ?

669
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,720
I've made you cry.
Forgive me.

670
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,000
I sometimes seem to fly
off the handle for no reason at all.

Don't I ?

00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,120
Come, we'll go home,

Here, let me haveJasper.

675
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,480
- Hello. Come in.
- Oh, please don't get up, Mr. Crawley.

676
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,400
I was just wondering if you meant
what you said the other day...

677
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,600
about showing me
the run of things ?

678
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,680
- Of course I did.
- What are you doing now ?

679
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,600
Notifying all the tenants that,
in celebration...

680
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,600
of Maxim's
return with his bride,

681
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,520
this week's rent will be free.

682
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,520
Oh, was that Maxim's idea ?

683
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,400
Oh, yes. All the servants
get an extra week's wages too.

684
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,400
Oh, he didn't tell me.
[ Chuckles ]

685
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,880
Can't I help you ?
I could at least lick the stamps.

686
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,200
That's terribly nice of you.
Won't you sit down ?

687
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,120
Oh, yes, thank you.

688
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,800
I, I was down at the cottage
on the beach the other day.

689
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,800
There was a man there--
a queer sort of person.

690
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,200
-Jasper kept barking at him.
- Oh, yes. Must've been Ben.

691
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,400
Excuse me.
He's quite harmless.

692
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,800
We give him odd jobs now and then.

693
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,400
That cottage place seemed
to be going to wreck and ruin.

694
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,320
Why isn't something
done about it ?

695
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,480
Well, I think if Maxim wanted anything
done about it, he'd tell me.

696
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,920
Are those all
Rebecca's things down there ?

697
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,720
Yes. Yes, they are.

698
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,400
What did she use the cottage for ?

699
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,800
The boat used to be moored near there.

700
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,000
What boat ? What happened to it ?

701
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,200
Was that the boat she was sailing
in when she was drowned ?

702
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,480
Yes. It capsized and sank.
She was washed overboard.

703
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,680
Wasn't she afraid
to go out like that alone ?

704
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,080
She wasn't afraid of anything.

705
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,520
Where did they fiind her ?

706
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:13,800
Near Edgecombe, about 40 miles
up channel, about two months afterwards.

707
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,400
Maxim went up to identify her.
It was horrible for him.

708
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,720
Yes, it must have been.

709
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,400
Mr. Crawley, please don't
think me morbidly curious.

710
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,280
It isn't that. It's just
that I feel at such a disadvantage.

711
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,200
All the time,
whenever I meet anyone,

712
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,280
Maxim's sister
or even the servants,

713
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,920
I know they're all
thinking the same thing.

714
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,480
They're all comparing me
with her, with Rebecca.

715
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,400
Oh, you mustn't think that.

716
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,000
I can't tell you how glad I am
that you've married Maxim.

717
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,280
It's going to make
all the difference to his life.

718
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,920
And from my point of view,
it's very refreshing...

719
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,800
to fiind someone like yourself
who's not entirely in tune,

720
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,120
shall we say, with Manderley.

721
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:59,000
That's very sweet of you.
I dare say I've been stupid,

722
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
but every day I realize
things that she had and that I lack:

723
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,400
beauty and wit and intelligence...

724
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,120
and, oh, all the things that
are so important in a woman.

725
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,400
But you have qualities
that are just as important--

726
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,600
more important, if I may say so.

727
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,920
Kindliness and sincerity...

728
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,000
and, if you'll forgive me, modesty...

729
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,480
mean more to a husband than
all the wit and beauty in the world.

730
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,880
We none of us want to live
in the past. Maxim least of all.

731
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,480
It's up to you, you know,
to lead us away from it.

732
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,600
Well, I promise you
I won't bring this up again,

733
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,520
but before we end
this conversation...

734
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,200
would you answer
just one more question ?

735
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:47,000
If it's something
I'm able to answer, I'll do my best.

736
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,880
Tell me, what was Rebecca really like ?

737
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,680
I suppose--

738
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:06,320
I suppose she was the most
beautiful creature I ever saw.

739
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,200
- Good evening, Maxim.
- Hello.

740

The fiilms of the honeymoon
have arrived at last.

Have we time, do you think,
before dinner ?

742
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,200
Well, what on earth
have you done to yourself?

743
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,520
Oh, nothing. I just ordered a new dress
from London. I hope you don't mind.

744
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,520
<i>Oh, no. Only do you think that</i>
<i>sort of thing is right for you ?</i>

745
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,720
- It doesn't seem your type at all.
- I thought you'd like it.

746
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,680
And what have you done to your hair ?

747
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,800
[ Laughing ]
Oh, I see.

748
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,200
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

749
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,200
You look lovely, lovely.

750
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,120
That's very nice... for a change.

751
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,800
Shall we see these pictures ?

752
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,200
Yes, I'd love to see them.

753
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,600
Ah, look, now. Look at that.

754
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,800
Wasn't it wonderful, darling ?
Can't we go back there someday ?

- Oh, remember that ?

- Yes.
- Oh, I wish our honeymoon could
have lasted forever, Maxim.

00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,480
Oh, dash it ! Look.
Oh. Oh. Oh, hang it.

763
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,680
I've threaded it up wrong,
as usual, or something.

Yes, Frith, what is it ?

765
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,280
Excuse me, sir.
May I have a word with you ?

Yes. Come in.

767
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,000
It's about Robert, sir.

768
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,200
There's been a slight unpleasantness
between him and Mrs. Danvers.

769
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,200
- Oh, dear.
- Robert is very upset.

770
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,520
This is trouble. What is it ?

771
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,680
It appears Mrs. Danvers
has accused Robert...

772
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,080
of stealing a valuable ornament
from the morning room.

773
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,280
<i>Robert denies the accusation</i>
<i>most emphatically, sir.</i>

774

- What was the thing, anyway ?
<i>- The china cupid, sir.</i>

<i>Very good, sir.</i>

778
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,600
Why do they come to me with these
things ? That's your job, sweetheart.

779
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,600
Maxim, I wanted to tell you,
but, um, well, I forgot.

780
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,320
- The fact is, I broke the china cupid.
- You broke it ?

781
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,400
Now, why on earth didn't you say
something about it when Frith was here ?

782
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,280
I don't know.
I didn't like to.

783
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,200
I was afraid he'd think me a fool.

784
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,280
Well, he'll think you
much more a fool now.

785
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,680
You'll have to explain to him
and Mrs. Danvers.

786
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,480
- No, you do it. I'll go upstairs.
- Don't be such a little idiot.

787
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,120
Anybody would think
you were afraid of them.

I suppose that's

Sometimes she and Mr. de Winter
didn't come home until dawn.

918

While she was undressing, she'd tell me
about the party she'd been to.

''Come on, Danny,

01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:54,000
I'd stand behind her like this
and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.

926
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,480
And then she would say,

927
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:00,000
''Good night, Danny,''
and step into her bed.

No, I don't believe it.

stay here a while and rest...

Why couldn't they have left it there

Well, I'd better get along

Forgiven you ?
What have I got to forgive you for ?

For last night,
my stupidity about the costume.

Oh, that.
I'd forgotten.

I was angry with you, wasn't I ?

Hmm.

Maxim, can't we start all over again ?

I don't ask that you should love me.
I won't ask impossible things.

1120

I'll be your friend, your companion.

The diver made another discovery.

He broke one of the ports
and looked into the cabin.

There was a body in there.

1141

Then she wasn't alone.

1142

There was someone sailing with her,

You don't understand.
There was no one with her.

that was not Rebecca.

1150

That was the body

unclaimed, belonging nowhere.

1152
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,520
I identifiied it,
but I knew it wasn't Rebecca.

How did you know, Maxim ?

01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:56,880
Because I put it there.

I nearly did sometimes,
but you never seemed close enough.

How could we be close when I knew
you were always thinking of Rebecca ?

What are you talking about ?
What do you mean ?

Whenever you touched me, I knew
you were comparing me with Rebecca.

Whenever you looked at me or spoke to me
or walked with me in the garden,

And when I was married, I was told
I was the luckiest man in the world.

Perhaps I was.

But after a while,
she began to grow careless.

01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:38,000
''Well, Max,
what are you going to do about it ?

1265
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,200
Aren't you going to kill me ?''

1266
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:46,080
I suppose I went mad for a moment.

1267
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:50,000
I must have struck her.

1268
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:56,000
She stood staring at me.

1269
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
She looked almost triumphant.

1270
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:04,480
Then she started
toward me again, smiling.

1271
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:07,120
Suddenly she stumbled and fell.

1272
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:16,800
When I looked down-- ages afterwards,
it seemed-- she was lying on the floor.

1273
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,520
She'd struck her head on a heavy
piece of ship's tackle.

1274
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:27,280
I remember wondering
why she was still smiling...

1275
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,400
then I realized she was dead.

1276
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:32,480
But you didn't kill her !
It was an accident !

1277
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:36,800
Who would believe me ?
I lost my head.

1278
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,320
I just knew I had to do something,
anything.

1279
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:43,400
I carried her out to the boat.

1280
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:47,200
It was very dark.
There was no moon.

1281
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:49,600
I put her in the cabin.

1282
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:52,320
When the boat seemed a safe distance
from the shore, I took a spike...

1283
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:55,200
and drove it again and again
through the planking of the hull.

1284
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:58,400
I had opened up the seacocks,
and the water began to come in fast.

1285
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,520
I climbed over into the dinghy
and pulled away.

1286
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:06,080
I saw the boat heel over... and sink.

1287
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,600
I pulled back into the cove.

1288
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,200
It started raining.

1289
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,880
Maxim, does anyone else know this ?

1290
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:19,520
No, no one, except you and me.

1291
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,720
We must explain it.

1292
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,920
It's got to be the body
of someone you've never seen before.

1293
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,800
No, they're bound to know her.

1294
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,800
Her rings, bracelets she always wore.

1295
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:35,400
They'll identify her body,
then they'll remember the other woman,

1296
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:38,600
the other woman
buried in the crypt.

1297
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,800
If they fiind out it was Rebecca,

1298
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,000
you must simply say that you made
a mistake about the other body--

1299
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,880
that the day you went
to Edgecombe, you were ill,
you didn't know what you were doing.

1300
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,120
Rebecca's dead.
That's what we've got to remember.

1301
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:51,120
Rebecca's dead.
She can't speak.

1302
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,280
She can't bear witness.
She can't harm you anymore.

1303
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:56,320
We're the only two people in the world
that know, Maxim--you and I.

1304
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,680
I told you once that I'd done
a very selfiish thing in marrying you.

1305
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:02,600
You can understand now
what I meant.

1306
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,520
I've loved you, my darling.

1307
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,600
I shall always love you.

1308
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:12,400
But I've known all along that
Rebecca would win in the end.

1309
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,720
No, no, she hasn't won.

1310
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:18,080

she hasn't won.

What's happened ?

1319
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,600
ColonelJulyan called.
He's the chief constable of the county.

1320
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:07,000
He's been asked by the police
to go to the mortuary.

1321
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,000
He wants to know if I could
possibly have made a mistake...

1322
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,200
about that other body.

1323
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:36,400
Well, ColonelJulyan, apparently I did
make a mistake about that other body.

1324
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:39,200
The mistake was quite natural
under the circumstances.

1325
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:42,480
- Besides, you weren't well at the time.
- I was perfectly well.

Well, don't let it worry you, Maxim.

1327
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,200
Nobody can blame you
for making a mistake.

1328
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:50,880
The pity is, you've got to go through
the same thing all over again.

1329
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,920
- What do you mean ?
- Oh, there'll have to be
another inquest, of course.

1330
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,720
- The same formality and red tape.
- Oh.

1331
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:59,800
I wish you could be spared
the publicity of it,
but I'm afraid that's impossible.

1332
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:02,200
Oh, yes, the publicity.

1333
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:04,880
I suppose Mrs. de Winter
went below for something...

1334
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:08,080
and a squall hit the boat
with nobody at the helm.

1335
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:11,200
I imagine that's about the solution
of it, don't you think so, Crawley ?

1336
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:14,480
Oh, yes. Probably the door jammed
and she couldn't get on deck again.

1337
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,400
Yes. Tabb, the boatbuilder,

1338
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,800
will undoubtedly come
to some such conclusion.

1339

Why ? What would he know about it ?

1340
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:23,200
Well, he's examining the boat now.

Purely as a matter of routine,
you know.

1342
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:29,120
I'll be at the inquest tomorrow, Maxim--
quite unoffiicially, you know.

We must get together for a game of golf

- Bye-bye.

- Oh, no thank you, Frith,

weren't troubled with them either.

I understand, madam. Permit me to say
that we're all most distressed outside.

1349

- Oh, thank you, Frith.
- I'm afraid the news has been
a shock to Mrs. Danvers.

01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,400
Yes, I rather expected it would be.

01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:05,120
It seems there's to be
a coroner's inquest, madam ?

1352
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:07,680
Yes, Frith.
It's purely a formality.

01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:10,200
Of course, madam.
I, I wanted to say...

that if any of us might be
required to give evidence,

I should be only too pleased to do
anything that might help the family.

Oh, thank you, Frith. I'm sure Mr.
de Winter will be very happy to hear it.

01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,600
Now, does that look like
the note of a woman who had made
up her mind to kill herself?

1575
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:17,920
And apart from that, Colonel,
do you mean to tell me that
if you wanted to commit suicide,

1576
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:20,800
you'd go to all the trouble
of putting out to sea in a boat,

1577
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:23,920
then take a hammer and chisel
and laboriously knock holes
through the bottom of it ?

1578
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:26,320
Come, Colonel,
as an offiicer of the law,

1579
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:29,520
don't you feel there are some
slight grounds for suspicion ?

1580
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:31,680
- Of murder ?
- What else ?

1581
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:35,000
You've known Max a long time, so
you know he's the old-fashioned type...

1582
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:38,080
<i>who</i>'<i>d die to defend his honor</i>
<i>or who</i>'<i>d kill for it.</i>

1583
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,000
It's blackmail, pure and simple.

1584
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:42,600
Blackmail's not so pure nor so simple.

1585
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:45,280
It can bring a lot of trouble
to a great many people,

1586
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:48,600
and the blackmailer sometimes fiinds
himself in jail at the end of it.

1587
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:51,520
I see. You're going to hold
de Winter's hand through all this...

1588
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:55,200
just because he's the big noise
around here and he's actually
permitted you to dine with him.

1589
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:57,600
Be careful, Favell.
You've brought an accusation of murder.

1590
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:00,200
<i>- Have you any witnesses ?</i>
<i>- I do have a witness.</i>

1591
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:02,080
- Oh.
- It's that fellow Ben.

1592
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:04,320
If that stupid coroner
hadn't been a snob,

1593
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,400
- he'd have seen that half-wit
was hiding something.
- And why should Ben do that ?

1594
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:10,400
Because we caught him once,
Rebecca and I, peering at us
through the cottage window.

1595
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:13,000
Rebecca threatened him with the asylum.
That's why he was afraid to speak.

1596
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,800
But he was always hanging about.
He must have seen this whole thing.

1597
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:18,600
It's ridiculous
even listening to all this.

1598
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:21,200
Ah. You're like a little trades union,
all of you, aren't you ?

1599
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:23,120
And if my guess is right, Crawley,

1600
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:26,400
<i>there</i>'<i>s a bit of malice</i>
<i>in your soul toward me, isn</i>'<i>t there ?</i>

1601
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:29,280
Crawley didn't have
much success with Rebecca,

1602
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:32,320
but he ought to have
more luck this time.

1603
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:35,200
<i>The bride will be grateful</i>
<i>for your fraternal arm, Crawley...</i>

1604
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,200
<i>in a week or so.</i>

1605
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:39,120
<i>- Every time she faints, in fact.</i>
<i>- De Winter!</i>

1606
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:41,120
- Maxim, please !
- De Winter !

1607
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:44,080
That temper of yours
will do you in yet, Max.

1608
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:46,600
<i>[ Knock At Door ]</i>

1609
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:52,000
Oh, uh, excuse me, gentlemen.
Now, is there anything else ?

1610
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,280
Yes. You might bring
Mr. de Winter a sedative.

1611
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,920
-No, no, nothing at all. Just leave us.
-Very good, sir.

1612
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:02,720
Now, Favell,
let's get this business over.

1613
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:05,200
As you seem to have worked out
the whole thing so carefully,

1614
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:07,520
perhaps you can provide us
also with a motive ?

1615
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:09,920
I knew you were going
to bring that up, Colonel.

1616
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,000
I've read enough detective stories to
know that there must always be a motive.

1617
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:16,720
And if you'll all excuse me
for a moment, I'll supply that too.

1618
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:20,000
I wish you would go home. You ought
not to be here through all this.

1619
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,920
Please let me stay, Maxim.

1620
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:23,920
<i>Surely, Colonel Julyan,you</i>'<i>re</i>
<i>not going to allow this fellow--</i>

1621
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,800
My opinion of Favell
is no higher than yours, Crawley.

1622
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,720
But in my offiicial capacity,

1623
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:30,880
I have no alternative
but to pursue his accusation.

1624
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,880
I entirely agree with you, Colonel.

1625
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,800
In a manner so serious as this,
we must make sure...

1626
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:37,680
of every point, explore every avenue,

1627
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:41,600
and, in fact, if I may coin a phrase,
leave no stone unturned.

1628
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:44,200
Ah, here she is-- the missing link,

1629
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:46,800
<i>the witness who will help</i>
<i>supply the motive.</i>

1630
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:50,000
<i>Colonel Julyan, Mrs. Danvers.</i>
<i>I believe you know everyone else.</i>

1631
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,000
<i>- Won</i>'<i>t you sit down ?</i>
- No offense, Colonel,
but I think I'll put this to Danny.

1632
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,600
She'll understand it more easily.
Danny, who was Rebecca's doctor ?

1633
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:59,280
Mrs. de Winter
always had Dr. McClean from the village.

1634
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:02,720
Now, you heard.
I said Rebecca's doctor, in London.

1635
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,920
I don't know anything about that.

1636
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:08,800
Oh, don't give me that.
You knew everything about Rebecca.

1637
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:11,200
You knew she was in love with me,
didn't you ?

1638
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:14,880
<i>Surely you haven</i>'<i>t forgotten</i>
<i>the good times she and I used</i>
<i>to have down at the cottage.</i>

1639
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:17,400
She had a right
to amuse herself, didn't she ?

1640
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:20,320
Love was a game to her.
It made her laugh, I tell you.

1641
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:23,280
She used to sit on her bed and
rock with laughter at the lot of you.

1642
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:27,200
Can you think of any reason why Mrs. de
Winter should have taken her own life ?

1643
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:29,200
No, no, I refuse to believe it.
I knew everything about her,

1644
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:31,120
and I won't believe it.

1645
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:34,000
There, you see ? It's impossible.
She knows that as well as I do.

1646
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,880
Now, listen to me, Danny. We know that
Rebecca went to a doctor in London.

1647
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:39,920
- Who was it ?
- I don't know.

1648
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:41,920
Oh, I understand, Danny.

1649
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:44,880
You think we're asking you
to reveal secrets of Rebecca's life.

1650
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:47,280
You're trying to defend her.
But that's what I'm doing.

1651
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:50,080
I'm trying to clear her name
of the suspicion of suicide.

1652
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:53,120
Mrs. Danvers,
it has been suggested...

1653
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:55,680
Mrs. de Winter
was deliberately murdered.

1654
01:53:55,680 --> 01:53:57,920
There you have it
in a nutshell, Danny.

1655
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:00,800
But there's one more thing you'll
want to know: the name of the murderer.

1656
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:03,600
It's a lovely name that
rolls off the tongue so easily:

1657
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:06,600
George Fortescue
Maximilian de Winter.

1658
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:15,600
There was a doctor. Mrs. de Winter
sometimes went to him privately.

1659
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:18,320
She used to go to him
even before she was married.

1660
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,600
We don't want reminiscences, Danny.
What was his name ?

1661
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:32,480
Dr. Baker, 1 65 Goldhawk Road,
Shepherd's Bush.

1662
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:35,400
There you are, Colonel.
There's where you'll fiind your motive.

1663
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:38,200
Go and question Dr. Baker.
He'll tell you why Rebecca went to him--

1664
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:40,480
<i>to confiirm the fact that</i>
<i>she was going to have a child,</i>

1665
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:42,880
<i>a sweet, curly-headed</i>
<i>little child.</i>

1666
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,680
It isn't true. It isn't true.
She would have told me.

1667
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:48,320
She told Max about it.
Maxim knew he wasn't the father.

1668
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:51,680
So, like the gentleman of the old school
that he is, he killed her !

1669
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:54,080
<i>[Julyan ] I</i>'<i>m afraid we shall have</i>
<i>to question this Dr. Baker.</i>

1670
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:58,000
Hear, hear. But for safety's sake,
I think I'd like to go along too.

1671
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,120
Yes, unfortunately, I suppose
you have the right to ask that.

1672
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:04,400
I'll see the coroner
and have the inquest postponed
pending further evidence.

1673
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:08,400
<i>I say, aren</i>'<i>t you rather afraid that the</i>
<i>prisoner, shall we say, might bolt ?</i>

1674
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:11,520
You have my word for it
that he will not do that.

1675
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:14,480
Toodle-oo, Max.
Come along, Danny.

1676
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:18,400
Let's leave the unhappy couple to spend
their last moments together alone.

1677
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:31,000
Are you sure you don't want me
to go with you, Maxim ?

1678
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
No, darling.
It'll be very tiring for you.

1679
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:36,800
I'll be back the very fiirst
thing in the morning, and
I won't even stop to sleep.

1680
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,880
I'll be waiting for you.

1681
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:46,720
- Ready, Maxim ?
- Yes.

1682
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:49,520
You two go on ahead.
I'll follow with Favell.

1683
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:06,880
Dr. Baker, you may have seen Mr. de
Winter's name in the papers recently.

1684
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:10,600
Oh, yes, yes. In connection
with a body that was found in a boat.

1685
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:13,400
My wife was reading all about it.
A very sad case.

1686
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:15,800
- My condolences--
- Oh, this is going to take hours.
Let me--

1687
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:18,600
Don't bother, Favell.
I think I can tell Dr. Baker.

1688
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:20,880
We're trying to discover
certain facts...

1689
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:24,200
concerning the late Mrs. de Winter's
activities on the day of her death,

1690
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:27,600
October 1 2, last year,
and I want you to tell me, if you can,

1691
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:30,800
if anyone of that name
paid you a visit on that date.

1692
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:33,800
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm afraid I can't help you.

1693
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:36,320
I should have remembered
the name de Winter.

1694
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,800
I've never attended
a Mrs. de Winter in my life.

1695
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:41,600
Well, how can you possibly tell
all your patients' names ?

1696
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:44,880
I can look it up
in my engagement diary if you like.

1697
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:47,920
<i>- Did you say the 1 2th of October?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

1698
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:52,480
<i>Oh, here we are.</i>
<i>No, no de Winter.</i>

1699
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:56,200
- Are you sure ?
- Well, here are all
the appointments for that day.

1700
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:59,600
'' Ross, Campbell, Steadall,
Perrino, Danvers, Mathews--''

1701
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:02,000
Danny ! What the devil !

1702
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,280
Would you read that name again ?
Did you say Danvers ?

1703
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:07,920
Yes, I have a Mrs. Danvers for 3:00.

1704
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,200
What did she look like ?
Can you remember ?

1705
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:13,400
Yes, I remember her quite well.
She was a very beautiful woman--

1706
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:16,320
tall, dark,
exquisitely dressed.

1707
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:19,520
- Rebecca.
- The lady must
have used an assumed name.

1708
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:25,120
Is that so ? This is a surprise.
I'd known her a long time.

1709
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:26,600
What was the matter with her ?

1710
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:28,720
My dear sir,
there are certain ethics.

1711
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:32,480
Could you supply a reason, Dr. Baker,
for Mrs. de Winter's suicide ?

1712
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:35,400
For her murder, you mean. She was
going to have a kid, wasn't she ?

1713
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:37,280
Come on, out with it !

1714
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:40,320
Tell me what else a woman of her class
be doing in a dump like this ?

1715
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:43,120
I take it the offiicial nature of this
visit makes it necessary for me to--

1716
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:47,120
I assure you we'd not be troubling you
if it were not necessary.

1717
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:49,520
You want to know
if I can suggest any motive...

1718
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:52,080
as to why Mrs. de Winter
should have taken her life ?

1719
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:55,200
Yes, I think I can.

1720
01:57:56,800 --> 01:58:00,480
The woman who called herself
Mrs. Danvers was very seriously ill.

1721
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:03,920
She was not
going to have a child ?

1722
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:07,600
That was what she thought,
but my diagnosis was different.

1723
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:12,600
I sent her to a well-known specialist
for an examination and X-rays,

1724
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:16,400
and on this date she returned
to me for his report.

1725
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:20,320
I remember her standing here
holding out her hand for the photograph.

1726
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:22,400
''I want to know the truth,''
she said.

1727
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:25,280
''I don't want soft words
and a bedside manner.

1728
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:28,000
If I'm for it,
you can tell me right away.''

1729
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,480
I knew she was not the type
to accept a lie.

1730
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:33,280
She'd asked for the truth,
so I let her have it.

1731
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:37,200
She thanked me and I never
saw her again, so I assumed that--

1732
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:40,200
- What was wrong with her ?
- Cancer.

1733
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:45,000
<i>Yes, the growth was deep-rooted.</i>

1734
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,920
<i>An operation would have been</i>
<i>no earthly use at all.</i>

1735
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:50,480
<i>In a short time,</i>
<i>she would have been under morphia.</i>

1736
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:53,920
<i>There was nothing that could</i>
<i>be done for her, e</i>x<i>cept wait.</i>

1737
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,600
<i>[ Ma</i>x<i>im ]</i>
<i>Did she say anything when you told her?</i>

1738
01:58:57,600 --> 01:59:00,880
<i>She smiled</i>
<i>in a queer sort of way.</i>

1739
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:03,680
Your wife was a wonderful woman,
Mr. de Winter.

1740
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:06,400
And, oh yes,
I remember she said something...

1741
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:09,280
that struck me as being
very peculiar at the time.

1742
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,800
When I told her
it was a matter of months,

1743
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:14,720
she said,
''Oh, no, Doctor, not that long.''

1744
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:20,600
You've been very kind.
You've told us all we wanted to know.

1745
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:23,280
We shall probably need
an offiicial verifiication.

1746
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:26,320
-Verifiication ?
<i>-Yes, to confiirm the verdict of suicide.</i>

1747
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:29,200
<i>[ Dr. Baker ] I understand. Can I</i>
<i>offer you gentlemen a glass of sherry?</i>

1748
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:32,200
<i>[Julyan ] No, very kind.</i>
<i>I think we ought to be going.</i>

1749
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:36,800
Thank heaven we know the truth.

1750
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:38,720
Dreadful thing, dreadful.

1751
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:41,400
Ayoung and lovely woman like her.
No wonder--

1752
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:45,800
I never had the remotest idea.
Neither did Danny, I'm sure.

1753
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:49,120
I wish I had a drink.

1754
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:51,600
Will we be needed at the inquest
any further, ColonelJulyan ?

1755
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:54,200
Oh, no. I can see to it that Maxim
is not troubled any further.

1756
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:56,400
- Thank you, sir.
- Are you ready to start, Colonel ?

1757
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:58,880
No, thank you.
I'm staying in town tonight.

1758
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:02,720
And let me tell you, Favell,
blackmail is not much of a profession,

1759
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:06,200
and we know how to deal with it
in our part of the world,
strange as it may seem to you.

1760
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:08,600
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

1761
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:11,600
But if you ever need a new car,
Colonel,just let me know.

1762
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:14,480
It's impossible to thank you for your
kindness to us through all this.

1763
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:17,120
- You know what I feel
without my saying anything.
- Not at all.

1764
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:20,000
Better let your wife know.
She'll be getting worried.

1765
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,880
Yes, I'll phone her at once, then
we'll get straight down to Manderley.

1766
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:26,000
Good-bye, Crawley.
Maxim's got a great friend.

1767
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:34,080
- Frank.
- Yes, Maxim ?

1768
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,320
There's something you don't know.

1769
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:40,880
Oh, no, there isn't.

1770
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:51,120
I didn't kill her, Frank.

1771
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:53,000
But I know now that when
she told me about the child,

1772
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,200
she wanted me to kill her.

1773
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:58,200
She lied on purpose.
She foresaw the whole thing.

1774
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:01,000
That's why she stood there
laughing when she--

1775
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,520
Don't think about it anymore.

1776
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:07,520
Thank you, Frank.

1777
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:12,720
Hello, Danny ?
I just wanted to tell you the news.

1778
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:16,720
Rebecca held out on both of us.
She had cancer.

1779
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:20,600
Yes, suicide.

1780
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:23,520
And now Max and that
dear little bride of his...

1781
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:27,200
will be able to stay on at Manderley
and live happily ever after.

1782
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:30,400
Bye-bye, Danny.

1783
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:36,400
- Is this your car, sir ?
- Yes.

1784
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:39,280
Will you be going soon ?
This isn't a parking place, you know.

1785
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:41,200
Oh, isn't it ?
People are entitled...

1786
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:43,280
to leave their cars
outside if they want to.

1787
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:46,720
It's a pity some of you fellows
haven't anything better to do.

1788
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:52,720
When you phoned,
did she say she'd wait up ?

1789
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:55,680
I asked her to go to bed,
but she wouldn't hear of it.

1790
02:01:57,200 --> 02:02:00,080
I wish I could get some
more speed out of this thing.

1791
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:02,480
Is something worrying you, Maxim ?

1792
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:05,400
I can't get over the feeling
something's wrong.

1793
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:52,880
- Frank !
- What's the matter ? Why did we stop ?

1794
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,880
What's the time ?

1795
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:57,680
Oh, this clock's wrong.
It must be 3:00 or 4:00. Why ?

1796
02:02:57,680 --> 02:02:59,920
<i>That can</i>'<i>t be the dawn</i>
<i>breaking over there.</i>

1797
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:02,480
It's in the winter that
you see the Northern Lights, isn't it ?

1798
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:07,400
That's not the Northern Lights.
That's Manderley !

1799
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:32,320
Frith ! Frith !
Mrs. de Winter. Where is she ?

1800
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:34,400
- I thought I saw her, sir.
- Where ?

1801
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:42,720
Maxim.

1802
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:46,800
Thank heaven
you've come back to me.

1803
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:49,680
- Are you all right, darling ?
Are you all right ?
- Oh, yes, I'm all right.

1804
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:52,400
Mrs. Danvers. She's gone mad.

1805
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:55,400
She said she'd rather destroy Manderley
than see us happy here.

1806
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:58,720
