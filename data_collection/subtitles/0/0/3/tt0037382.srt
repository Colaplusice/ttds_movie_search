1
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,170
Good morning.

2
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,970
Good morning, Capt. Morgan.
What can I do for you today?

3
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,430
Same thing as yesterday.

4
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,640
You and your client wish to make
a temporary exit from the port?

5
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,180
That is right.

6
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,850
- Name?
- Harry Morgan.

7
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,190
- Nationality?
- Eskimo.

8
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,280
- What?
- American.

9
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,410
- Name of ship?
- <i>Queen Conch</i>, Key West, Florida.

10
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,660
We're going fishing, like we've done
every day for over two weeks.

11
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,870
We'll be back tonight, and I don't think
we'll go more than 30 miles offshore.

12
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,370
Five francs, please.

13
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,580
One more thing.

14
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,130
You will go nowhere near the vicinity
of territorial waters...

15
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,260
Sainte-Lucie, or Dominique.

16
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,260
- Is that a new order?
- Yes.

17
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,050
The decree was issued last night
by his Excellency, Admiral Robert...

18
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,640
Governor General
of the French West Indies.

19
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,470
Good for him.

20
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,560
- Why, any complaints?
- No.

21
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,950
Hello, Harry. How's everything?

22
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,870
That feels good.

23
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,210
- Did you bring me a drink?
- Horatio's bringing it.

24
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,500
You're my pal, Harry.
We sure got them this morning.

25
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,550
- We got them every morning.
- Not last Thursday.

26
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,550
That's right, I forgot. You're right, Eddie.

27
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,010
Here's Horatio. Give him a hand, will you?

28
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,550
- Good morning, <i>mon Capitaine</i>.
- Good morning.

29
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,720
- Did you get the bait?
- Yes, sir. Plenty of it.

30
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,520
- That guard took a bottle of our beer.
- Mr. Johnson can afford it.

31
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,730
- Harry, can I have....
- Just one.

32
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,240
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Johnson.

33
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,700
- Are we going out?
- That's up to you.

34
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,620
What sort of a day will it be?

35
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,660
I don't know.
Just about like yesterday. Only better.

36
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,370
- Let's go out, then.
- Okay. Hop aboard.

37
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,080
- Stand by to cast off.
- All right, <i>mon Capitaine</i>.

38
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,420
- Mr. Johnson.
- Yeah?

39
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,590
- I got to get some gas.
- All right.

40
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,470
I'll need money for that.

41
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,340
How much?

42
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,140
28 cents a gallon. 40 gallons.

43
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,390
That'll be $11.20.

44
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,770
There's $15.

45
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,520
- I'll get you some change at the gas dock.
- Put it against what I owe you.

46
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,020
Let her go.

47
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,830
Watch it, Johnson.

48
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,040
There's your strike.

49
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,000
Put on a little more drag. Not too much.

50
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,920
You'll have to sock him.
He's gonna jump, anyway.

51
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,300
Hit him again. Hit him three or four times.
Stick it into him.

52
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,220
Better get the other teaser in.

53
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,600
I got him!

54
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,560
Ease up on that drag.

55
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,850
He's gone.

56
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,060
He's not. Ease up on that drag. Quick.

57
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,240
If he wants to go, let him go.

58
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,790
- He's gone.
- No, he's hooked good.

59
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,870
- He sure is.
- Reel him in.

60
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,500
No. I'm sure he's gone.

61
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,590
I'll tell you when he's gone. Reel in fast.

62
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,350
- He's gone now.
- Yes, sir, he's gone now.

63
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,600
- He isn't. Turn around and chase him.
- Reel in that line.

64
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,560
- I can still feel him pull.
- That's the weight of the line.

65
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,020
You're crazy. I can hardly reel it in.
Maybe he's dead.

66
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,860
Maybe. But he's still jumping out there.

67
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,960
- Come on. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying, Mr. Johnson.

68
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,580
- Can't you put bait on like that, Captain?
- Sure I can.

69
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,960
- Why carry this fellow to do it?
- When the big fish run, you'll see.

70
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,340
What's the idea?

71
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,170
He can do it faster than I can.

72
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,390
A dollar a day
seems like an unnecessary expense to me.

73
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,350
He's necessary. Aren't you, Horatio?

74
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,760
I hope so.

75
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,060
Can't Eddie do it?

76
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,190
No, he can't.

77
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,520
What's the matter?

78
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,360
He just lost a fish.

79
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,360
Mr. Johnson, you're unlucky.

80
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,280
Would it be all right if I-

81
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,030
- In the icebox. Just take one.
- Thanks.

82
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,120
I don't see why
you want that rummy around.

83
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,370
Eddie was a good man on a boat
before he got to be a rummy.

84
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,620
He's no good now.

85
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,580
Start her going ahead.

86
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,000
- Is he related to you or something?
- No.

87
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,710
- What do you look after him for?
- He thinks he's looking after me.

88
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,720
All right, let her run.

89
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,520
- Mr. Johnson.
- Yeah?

90
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,480
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

91
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,610
Look, it might interest you to know
I not only bought the beer...

92
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,030
- but I put a deposit on the bottles.
- Was you ever bit by a dead bee?

93
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,830
- A dead what?
- A dead honeybee.

94
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,040
I was never bit by any kind of a bee.

95
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
- You sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

96
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,880
In that case, I'll just finish my nap.
Thanks for the beer.

97
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,380
Watch that line.

98
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,890
That's enough for one day.

99
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,900
- What happened?
- Nothing. You just lost a rod and reel.

100
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,440
You had the drag screwed tight.
When the fish struck, you couldn't hold it.

101
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,860
If you had the harness
buckled down to the reel...

102
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,240
that fish would have taken you
along with him.

103
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,620
You're just unlucky, Mr. Johnson.
Now, maybe you're lucky with women.

104
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,540
- What do you say if we go out tonight?
- I'll lucky you, you dirty rummy.

105
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,210
- Are you a good swimmer?
- I've taken all I'm gonna take.

106
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,580
Me, too. Be careful
you don't slip out of my hands.

107
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,290
Take it easy.
This guy owes you for 16 days.

108
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,880
Fifteen.

109
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,060
You talk too much, Eddie.

110
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,770
I know it, Harry.

111
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,270
Okay, forget it.

112
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,460
What about tomorrow?

113
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,300
I don't think so.
I'm fed up with this kind of fishing.

114
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,050
I can see how you would be.
Slack that off a little.

115
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,300
You fish for 16 days,
hook a couple of fish any good fisherman...

116
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,470
would give his life to tie into,
and lose both.

117
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,680
- You're just unlucky. I never seen no one-
- Shut up, Eddie.

118
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,980
You said 16 days. I only owe you for 15.

119
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,730
No. With today it's 16.
Then there's the rod and reel.

120
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,610
- The tackle's your risk.
- Not when you lose it like you did.

121
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,860
I paid to rent it every day. It's your risk.

122
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,820
If you ran a hired car over a cliff,
you'd have to pay for it.

123
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,320
- Not if he was in it. That's a good one.
- That's good, Eddie.

124
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,530
You lost the outfit through carelessness.

125
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,160
It cost me $275.

126
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,370
I won't charge you for the line, 'cause
a fish so big could've taken it all anyway.

127
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:32,000
And there's 16 days at $35 a day,
that's $560.

128
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,170
No, it's $560, Eddie.

129
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,340
You got a little credit,
so that'll be $825 altogether.

130
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,140
That's what you owe me,
and that's what I want.

131
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,220
I haven't got that much with me.
I'll go to the bank in the morning.

132
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,850
- That'll be all right?
- I guess it'll have to be.

133
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,770
- Let's go have a drink.
- Good idea-

134
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,850
- Stay here and lock up.
- Sure you don't-

135
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,110
No, Eddie.

136
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,530
Look there. I thought everybody
took their flag in after 6:00.

137
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,160
- Most of them do.
- That's Vichy for you.

138
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,910
It's their flag.

139
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,490
See you later.

140
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,050
Gentlemen, may I have your names?

141
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,350
What for?

142
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,470
I heard this gentleman
make a disparaging reference to Vichy.

143
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,890
I never said anything about Vichy, did I?

144
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,060
I don't know,
I wasn't paying much attention.

145
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,230
- Your names, please.
- Look, we're Americans....

146
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,860
His name's Johnson. My name's Morgan.
We're living at the Marquis Hotel.

147
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,320
That do you?

148
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,500
Yes, sir?

149
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,330
- What's yours?
- Bourbon.

150
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,130
Bourbon. And a rum for me.

151
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,210
- Gentlemen, what luck today?
- Not so good, Frenchy.

152
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,130
- We lost the biggest fish I ever saw.
- Maybe tomorrow you hook him again.

153
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,050
Not me. I'm through. This is my last day.

154
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,010
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

155
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,510
Here's to you.

156
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,350
I'm gonna clean up.

157
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,060
- That was $800 and....
- $25.

158
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,690
$825.

159
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,940
- Johnson.
- Yeah?

160
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,690
What time tomorrow morning?

161
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,660
After I get to the bank.
Say around 10:30 or 11:00?

162
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,700
I'll be waiting for you.

163
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,620
- Any trouble, Harry?
- No, Frenchy.

164
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,620
- Then you are free after today?
- Yeah. Why?

165
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,750
There were some people in here today.
They wanted to hire your boat.

166
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,510
- Fishermen?
- No. Some friends of friends of mine.

167
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,890
Not a chance.

168
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,810
- The key, <i>monsieur</i>.
- Thank you.

169
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,690
Please listen to me, Harry.

170
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,190
They only want to use your boat
for one night.

171
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,900
- They'll pay you well.
- For what?

172
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,690
I'd like to oblige, but I can't afford
to get mixed up in local politics.

173
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,280
I would not speak if it weren't important.

174
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,330
Please, can I go with you to your room?

175
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,120
Sure. Come ahead.

176
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,020
Anybody got a match?

177
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,080
Thanks.

178
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,960
Who's that?

179
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,430
She came in this afternoon.
The plane from the south.

180
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,390
Now look, Frenchy, about that other thing.

181
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,350
I know where you stand
and what your sympathies are.

182
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,060
It's all right for you,
but I don't want any part of it.

183
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,020
If I'm caught fooling with you fellas,
my goose'll be cooked.

184
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,570
Probably lose my boat, too.
I ain't that interested.

185
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,780
But they are coming to see you tonight.

186
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,910
You better get word to them.
They'll just be wasting their time.

187
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,160
Sorry. I'll see you later.

188
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,190
Take over.

189
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,100
Bravo!

190
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,200
I tried to reach those fellows,
but I can't get in contact with them.

191
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,080
Who? The ones who wanted
to hire my boat?

192
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,790
It's dangerous enough for them
to come at all, but to come for nothing-

193
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,130
I didn't ask to see them.
You better head them off.

194
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,410
- Hello.
- Let's have it.

195
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,170
- What do you want?
- Johnson's wallet.

196
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,250
- What?
- Come on.

197
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,630
What are you talking about?

198
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,090
Mister, what's got into you?

199
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,140
What do you think you're gonna do?

200
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,900
I'm gonna get that wallet, Slim.

201
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,980
I'd rather you wouldn't call me Slim.

202
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,570
I'm a little too skinny to take it kindly.

203
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,990
Quit the baby talk.

204
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,330
Which is it?

205
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,040
You know, Steve,
I wouldn't put it past you.

206
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,580
I didn't know you were a hotel detective.

207
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,800
Johnson's my client.

208
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,460
He doesn't speak so well of you.

209
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,180
He's still my client.

210
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,010
Pick on somebody to steal from
that doesn't owe me money.

211
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,470
He dropped it and I picked it up.

212
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,980
You were gonna give it back to him,
of course?

213
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,980
No, I wasn't.

214
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,480
- I don't like him.
- That's a pretty good reason.

215
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,190
Besides, I need boat fare
to get out of Martinique.

216
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,360
Another good reason...

217
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,450
but you'll have to get it
from somebody else.

218
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,320
- How do you like that?
- Find anything?

219
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,660
About $60 in cash
and about $1,400 in traveler's checks.

220
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,660
Do you expect more?

221
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,040
That bird owed me $825.

222
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,420
"I haven't got that much on me," he says.

223
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,800
"I'll have to go to the bank
and pay you off tomorrow," he says.

224
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,140
And all the time he's got a reservation
on a plane leaving tomorrow at daylight.

225
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,390
So he was gonna skip out on you.

226
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,060
Your client.

227
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,680
- Good thing you didn't give it back to him.
- Then I did you a favor.

228
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,150
That's right. But if I hadn't stopped you...

229
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,480
you'd have gotten away
with the whole works.

230
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,190
After all, I am entitled to something.

231
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,690
Don't you think so, Slim?

232
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,740
What do you think is fair?

233
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,290
I'll leave that to you.

234
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,370
What would you say to....

235
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,300
Please, Harry.
I told them, but they insisted-

236
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,300
It is not Gerard's fault, Mr. Morgan.

237
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,470
Come in and close the door.

238
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,010
You know,
I told Frenchy I wasn't interested.

239
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,270
I know. But close the door, please.

240
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,730
I'm very sorry to intrude this way...

241
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,820
- but this is of great importance and we-
- One moment.

242
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,240
I'd better go.

243
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,990
- See you later.
- Stick around. We're not through yet.

244
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,450
It's all right to talk in front of her, isn't it?

245
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,250
- Go ahead.
- But it's no good.

246
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,750
- If you'd listen-
- No use.

247
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,540
- You're taking a chance coming here.
- We're not afraid.

248
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,300
I am. I'm sorry, I can't and won't do it.

249
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,130
We'll give you 2,500 francs.

250
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,920
- That's only $50 in American money.
- It is more to us.

251
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,760
It is only a little voyage
to a place about 40 kilometers from here.

252
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,600
- We'd give you more money, but we can't.
- It's all we have.

253
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,140
Don't make me feel bad.
I tell you true, I can't do it.

254
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,600
Afterwards, when things are changed,
it would mean a good deal to you.

255
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,770
Yes, I know.

256
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,400
Mr. Morgan, I thought all Americans
were friendly to our side.

257
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,150
They are. But there's a rumor
that they put fellas on Devil's Island...

258
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,070
for doing what you're doing.
I'm not that friendly to anybody.

259
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,280
But they wouldn't do that to an American.

260
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,290
Do you really think that?

261
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,290
- Who's that?
- It's me, Harry.

262
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,710
It's all right.

263
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,960
- Hi, Harry? How you been keeping?
- Hello, Eddie.

264
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,420
- I wanted to talk to you about-
- Could we continue-

265
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,300
Who are you? Who are these guys, Harry?

266
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,800
Eddie's a friend of mine.

267
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,930
He was hanging around the dock
after you left.

268
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,020
You have a good memory
for one who drinks.

269
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,020
Drinking don't bother my memory.
If it did I wouldn't drink.

270
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,850
I couldn't. You see...

271
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,770
I'd forget how good it was.
Then where would I be?

272
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,610
- I'd start drinking water again.
- Maybe you'd forget about water, too.

273
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,990
No, I wouldn't. I see too much of it.

274
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,660
Was you ever bit by a dead bee?

275
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,290
I've no memory of ever being bit
by any kind of bee.

276
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,420
Were you?

277
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,590
You're all right.
You and Harry's the only ones that-

278
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,460
- Don't forget Frenchy.
- Right. You, Harry and Frenchy.

279
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,590
You got to be careful of dead bees
if you go around barefooted.

280
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,100
If you step on them, they can sting
just as bad as if they was alive.

281
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,390
Especially if they was kind of mad
when they got killed.

282
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,190
- I bet I've been bit 100 times that way.
- You have? Why don't you bite them back?

283
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,730
That's what Harry always says.

284
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,980
But I ain't got no stinger.

285
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,650
- Does he always talk so much?
- Always.

286
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,530
- What do you want to see me about?
- Oh, yeah, Harry....

287
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,700
I guess I forgot.

288
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,370
That's all right.
I'll see you down at the dock later tonight.

289
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,540
Say, Harry, could you....

290
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,460
Thanks. You're all right. So long.

291
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,930
Sorry. We could stay at this all night
and the answer would still be the same.

292
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,510
I don't care who runs France
or Martinique, or who wants to run it.

293
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,680
You'll have to get somebody else.

294
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,060
Come on, Slim.
We still got some unfinished business.

295
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,150
Good night.

296
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,820
Make yourselves at home, boys.
Cigarettes are on the table over there.

297
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,820
I want to see Johnson's face
when you give it back to him.

298
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,240
All right.

299
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,720
Where've you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

300
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,890
You're a fine one, running off with my girl.

301
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,940
She's got something
she wants to give you. Go ahead, Slim.

302
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,770
Here's your wallet.

303
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,480
- How did you get it?
- I stole it.

304
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,610
That's a fine thing.
What are you gonna do about it?

305
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,950
The question is,
what are you going to do about it?

306
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,660
You'd better look it over
and see if it's all there.

307
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,250
It's all right, I'm sure.

308
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,580
No, you check it over.
She might want a receipt for it.

309
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,000
- It's all right. There's nothing missing.
- You sure?

310
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,630
Yeah. Now, young lady, I-

311
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,420
You better count those traveler's checks.

312
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:54,140
- I know. There's $1,400.
- But you had to go to the bank tomorrow.

313
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,390
What's the time on that plane ticket
you got there?

314
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,560
6:30.

315
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,600
In the morning.
And the bank opens at 10:00.

316
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,450
- I don't like him any better than you do.
- I was going to-

317
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,950
You were going to sign some
of those traveler's checks, weren't you?

318
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,160
- Yeah. Sure.
- Emil, you got a pen handy?

319
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,850
- $825.
- Yeah.

320
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,350
Stay where you are!

321
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,240
- Stay where you are.
- I think I'm sitting on someone's cigarette.

322
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,980
- This is awful.
- Did they get them all?

323
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,150
One got away, at least.
I think it was Beauclere.

324
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,940
Look, Harry, this is bad.

325
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,320
But no one but me knows
that you two saw them.

326
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,320
And Eddie, but he won't remember.

327
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,580
When the police come, you know nothing.
Do you realize, <i>mademoiselle</i>?

328
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,580
Don't be a fool. Stay inside.

329
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,970
<i>Monsieur</i> Gerard!

330
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,900
Cut it out, Cricket.

331
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,950
He couldn't write any faster
than he could duck.

332
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,960
Another minute
and these checks would have been good.

333
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:40,180
Stay right where you are and keep quiet!
Stay right where you are.

334
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,270
- Who's that?
<i>- Sret Nationale.</i>

335
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,060
Gestapo?

336
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,980
Lot of them, isn't there?

337
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,290
- What happened to this man?
- A stray bullet.

338
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,300
His name is Johnson, an American.

339
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,170
- Unfortunate. Take him away.
- Yes, sir.

340
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,350
Call attention.

341
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,520
Your attention, everyone.

342
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,850
All this is regrettable,
but there is no cause for alarm.

343
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,650
We are only interested in those persons...

344
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,820
who have broken the rules
laid down for their behavior.

345
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,530
We shall pick out certain individuals.

346
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,290
Those we do not designate
will leave immediately.

347
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,790
This place will then remain closed
for tonight.

348
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,880
This man.

349
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,460
You.

350
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,890
And <i>mademoiselle</i>.

351
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,890
Was you ever bit by a dead bee?

352
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,940
Come with me, please.

353
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,240
I tell you, I didn't know those men.
They came in for a drink. That's all I know.

354
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,790
- You say you never saw these men before?
- No.

355
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,580
What are your sympathies,
<i>Monsieur</i> Gerard?

356
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,750
I am for France.

357
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,380
That is well. Try to remain so.

358
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,800
Let us suggest to <i>Monsieur</i> Gerard...

359
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,640
that the next time suspicious characters
enter his place...

360
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,760
that he notify us.

361
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,890
In that way he may prevent bloodshed
at his doorstep.

362
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,310
I run a public place.

363
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,770
How am I to know who is suspicious
and who is not?

364
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,150
- I think you will know. Good night.
- That is all. You may go.

365
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,610
- Got all of them?
- Beauclere and Emil got away.

366
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,780
- How?
- Jumped off the wagon, ran up an alley.

367
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,030
- Search all the places on your list.
- Yes, sir.

368
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,740
- Continue.
- Did you know these men?

369
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,910
I didn't.

370
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,410
- You did not see them at all in the caf?
- Right.

371
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,830
What was your connection
with the dead man?

372
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,340
- He rented my boat to fish from.
- You mean he had rented it.

373
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,010
The tickets in his wallet show
he was to leave Martinique at daylight.

374
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,550
There was no money on him
or in his wallet.

375
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,470
Only some American traveler's checks.

376
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,810
Was that customary with him?

377
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,310
There was $60 in it.

378
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,190
- What happened to it?
- I took it.

379
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,100
- Why?
- Because he owed me $825.

380
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,530
So at least you had no reason to kill him,
did you?

381
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,950
- So it would seem.
- But unfortunately for you, someone did.

382
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,740
As a result of which,
you took it on yourself...

383
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,080
to collect a part of the debt.

384
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,580
- That's right.
- You have this money now?

385
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,000
If you please.

386
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,840
If you please, <i>Capitaine</i>.

387
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,510
This is mine.

388
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,350
How do we know that?

389
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,310
Thank you. Do not be concerned.

390
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,060
This money is impounded
by a government which, like your own...

391
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,940
is at peace with the world.

392
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,530
If your claim is just, it will be discharged.

393
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,370
<i>Mademoiselle.</i> That is all for you.

394
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,660
"Browning, Marie. American, age 22."

395
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,960
How long have you been in Fort de France?

396
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,920
I arrived by plane this afternoon.

397
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,300
- Residence?
- Hotel Marquis.

398
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,050
Where do you come from?

399
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,720
Trinidad. Port of Spain.

400
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,180
And before that,
from where, <i>mademoiselle</i>?

401
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,600
- From home, perhaps?
- No. From Brazil, Rio.

402
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,640
- Alone?
- Yes.

403
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,140
- Why did you get off here?
- To buy a new hat.

404
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,350
Why?

405
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,860
To buy a new... hat.

406
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,440
Read the label.
Maybe you'll believe me then.

407
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,610
I never doubted you, <i>mademoiselle</i>.

408
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,240
It is only your tone that was objectionable.

409
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,410
I'll ask you again.

410
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,910
Why did you get off here?

411
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,710
I didn't have money enough
to go any further.

412
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,920
That's better. Where were you
when the shooting occurred?

413
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,790
- I was-
- You don't have to answer.

414
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,590
- Shut up, you.
- Don't answer it.

415
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,420
- I told you to shut up.
- Go ahead. Slap me.

416
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,050
Come, <i>Capitaine</i>. This is not a brawl.

417
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,140
We wish to get to the bottom of this affair.

418
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,350
You'll never do it
by slapping people around.

419
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,270
That's bad luck.

420
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,770
We shall see.

421
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:42,690
If we need to question you further,
you will be available at the hotel?

422
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,110
I don't know how I'm gonna go any place
when you got my passport and money.

423
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,820
Your passport will be returned to you.

424
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,490
As for the money...

425
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,740
if it is yours,
that will arrange itself in good time.

426
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,120
Do you suggest I see the American Consul
and have him help you arrange it?

427
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,290
That is your privilege.

428
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,050
By the way, what are your sympathies?

429
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,590
- Minding my own business.
- May I-

430
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,680
I don't need any advice
about continuing to do it, either.

431
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,470
- Good night, <i>Capitaine</i>.
- Let's get out of this.

432
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,190
Say, I don't understand all this.
After all, I just got here.

433
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,660
You landed right in the middle
of a small war.

434
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,950
What's it all about?

435
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:36,540
The boys we just left joined with Vichy.
You know what that is?

436
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,500
- Vaguely.
- They've got the Navy behind them.

437
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,750
- You saw that carrier in the harbor?
- Yeah.

438
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:45,420
The other fellas they were shooting at,
they're the Free French.

439
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,010
- You know what they are?
- It's not getting any clearer.

440
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,180
Most of the people on the island,
the natives, are patriots.

441
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,430
They're for de Gaulle, but so far they
haven't been able to do much about it.

442
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,100
- Are we in trouble?
- No, Eddie.

443
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,060
- I seen them pick you up and was scared-
- Everything's okay.

444
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,810
Go back and get some sleep.

445
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,020
I'd have got you out. You know me.

446
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,570
I know you, Eddie.
You go on back to the boat.

447
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,150
- Harry, could you-
- No.

448
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,700
- But-
- No more tonight, Eddie. Beat it.

449
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,370
- I could use a drink myself.
- We can get one in here.

450
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,370
What do you wish to drink, sir?

451
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,540
What'll it....

452
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,710
We're just looking around.

453
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,050
Change your mind?

454
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,380
No money. Those guys cleaned me out.

455
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,720
I forgot, too.

456
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,510
Maybe I can do something.

457
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,470
This has been a long day, and I'm thirsty.

458
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,810
Picked him out yet?

459
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,350
You don't mind, do you?

460
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,610
If you're thirsty, go ahead.
If I get tired of waiting I'll be at the hotel.

461
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,230
All right.

462
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,410
May I?

463
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Thanks.

464
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,410
Hello.

465
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,290
Come on in.

466
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,210
- You're sore, aren't you?
- Why should I be?

467
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:40,140
- I didn't behave very well, did I?
- You did all right.

468
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,760
You got the bottle, didn't you?

469
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,850
- You're sore, aren't you?
- Get this straight. I don't give-

470
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,600
I know. You don't give a whoop what I do.

471
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,690
But when I do it you get sore.
After all, you told me to, you know.

472
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,070
- I told you?
- You said go ahead, didn't you?

473
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:00,610
That's right. I guess I did.
You were pretty good at it, too.

474
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,570
Thanks.

475
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,240
- Would you rather I wouldn't?
- Wouldn't what?

476
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,830
Do things like that.

477
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,710
- Why ask me?
- I'd like to know.

478
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,500
- Of all the screwy-
- All right. I won't do it anymore.

479
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,500
- I didn't ask-
- I know you didn't.

480
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,670
Don't worry.
I'm not giving up anything I care about.

481
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,390
It's like shooting fish in a barrel, anyway.

482
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,390
Men like that. They're all a bunch of....

483
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,850
I'm a fine one to talk.
The pot calling the kettle.

484
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,730
How long have you been away from home?

485
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,820
- This is about the time for it, isn't it?
- Time for what?

486
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,990
The story of my life.
Where do you want me to begin?

487
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,240
I got a pretty fair idea already.

488
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,280
- Who told you?
- You did.

489
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,450
- That slap in the face you took.
- What about it?

490
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,080
You hardly blinked an eye.
It takes a lot of practice to do that.

491
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,500
Yeah, I know a lot about you, Slim.

492
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,210
The next time I get slapped
I better do something about it.

493
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,550
- You forgot your drink.
- I don't want it.

494
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,340
- Who's sore now?
- I am.

495
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,780
- Who is it?
- It's me.

496
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,240
The door's unlocked.

497
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,500
- You forgot your bottle.
- I said I didn't want it.

498
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,340
You are sore, aren't you?

499
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,130
I asked you a question.
You didn't answer me.

500
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:42,130
I said you're sore, aren't you?

501
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,590
Look, I'm tired
and I want to get some sleep.

502
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,600
That's not a bad idea.
What made you so mad?

503
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,980
- I've been mad ever since I met you.
- Most people are.

504
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,650
One look and you decided
just what you wanted to think about me.

505
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,190
You were.... What's the use?

506
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,690
Go ahead. Keep on going.

507
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,360
You don't know me, Steve.

508
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,370
It doesn't work.

509
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,450
I brought that bottle up here
to make you feel cheap.

510
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,460
That didn't work either.

511
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,630
Instead, I'm the one who feels cheap.

512
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,670
I've never felt that way before.

513
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,340
I wanted....

514
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,510
I thought that maybe....

515
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,070
Go on. Get out of here
before I make a complete fool of myself.

516
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,910
How long have you been away from home?

517
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,580
It's none of....

518
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,420
About six months.

519
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,920
Going back?

520
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,010
- How?
- What are you gonna do here?

521
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,430
I don't know. Get a job, maybe.

522
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,760
Jobs are hard to get.
I don't think you'd like it here anyway.

523
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,310
Remind you of somebody, Steve?

524
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,610
This is brand new to me. I like it.

525
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,480
Would you go back if you could?

526
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,440
I'd walk...

527
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,490
if it wasn't for all that water.

528
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,590
Quit worrying, kid.
You'll get back all right.

529
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,540
- What the....
- Here's that bottle again.

530
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,830
It's getting to be quite a problem, isn't it?

531
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,300
- You want a drink?
- No.

532
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,800
I thought you were tired and going to bed.

533
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,470
I know. I thought so, too.
You gave me something to think about.

534
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,640
- You said you might be able to help me.
- That's right.

535
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,720
But how can you do that if....

536
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:42,020
Are you gonna take that job with those
men that were up here with Frenchy?

537
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,610
Yeah, if I can find what's left of them.

538
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:48,440
I flew over Devil's Island.
It doesn't look like a high-class resort.

539
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,570
- That's what I heard.
- I don't want to be the cause-

540
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,830
Don't get the idea I'm doing this
just to help you. I need money, too.

541
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,710
Won't Frenchy help you out
without you having to do that?

542
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,380
I don't want his help.

543
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,710
Don't do it, will you, Steve?

544
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,720
- Look, didn't you ask me-
- Don't do it.

545
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,890
Why don't you take this bottle
and go to bed?

546
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,100
Here. Can you use this?

547
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,480
I thought you said you were broke.

548
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,560
You're good. You're awful good.

549
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,530
"I'd walk home
if it wasn't for all that water."

550
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,030
- Who was the girl, Steve?
- Who was what girl?

551
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,250
The one who left you
with such a high opinion of women.

552
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,330
She must have been quite a gal.

553
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,500
You think I lied to you about this,
don't you?

554
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,880
It just happens there's about $30 here.

555
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,670
Not enough for boat fare
or any other kind of fare.

556
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,720
Just enough to be able to say "no"
if I feel like it.

557
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,180
And you can have it if you want it.

558
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,220
I'm sorry, Slim.

559
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,480
But I still say you're awful good
and I wouldn't-

560
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,150
I forgot. You wouldn't take anything
from anybody, would you?

561
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,440
That's right.

562
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,240
You know, Steve...

563
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,910
you're not very hard to figure.
Only at times.

564
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,620
Sometimes I know exactly
what you're going to say.

565
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,040
Most of the time. The other times....

566
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,090
The other times you're just a stinker.

567
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:39,050
- What did you do that for?
- I've been wondering whether I'd like it.

568
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,600
What's the decision?

569
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,770
I don't know yet.

570
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,480
It's even better when you help.

571
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,870
Sure you won't change your mind
about this?

572
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,790
This belongs to me, and so do my lips.
I don't see any difference.

573
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:04,910
I do.

574
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:06,790
Okay.

575
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:11,000
You know you don't have to act with me.

576
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,260
You don't have to say anything
and you don't have to do anything.

577
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,510
Not a thing.

578
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:19,180
Maybe just whistle.

579
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,850
You know how to whistle,
don't you, Steve?

580
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:28,770
You just put your lips together and blow.

581
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,500
Here, chick.

582
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,560
You keep watching.

583
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:10,400
It's all right. They have gone.

584
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:12,690
Go on.

585
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,490
You come along the lee shore of Anguilla
from the south.

586
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,320
About three kilometers from the point.

587
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,410
- There's a little cove and a jetty?
- You know it, then.

588
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,910
- The signal's been arranged?
- Emil can show you.

589
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:25,540
- Emil's not gonna be there.
- Why?

590
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,960
I'm doing this my way. I'm going alone.

591
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,790
What are the signals?

592
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:34,040
You flash a light to the shore.
They will answer it with two lights.

593
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,050
One held above the other.
There'll be two people to bring back.

594
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,920
- How'll I know them?
- We've never seen them.

595
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,340
We know the name of one only.
Paul de Bursac.

596
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,640
That's good enough.
How about landing them back here?

597
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,600
Do you know Cape Saint-Pierre?

598
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,350
- A boat can meet you offshore there.
- You be on that boat, Frenchy.

599
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,020
I'll get out of here around noon.
Supposedly fishing.

600
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:56,530
With luck and no patrol boats,
I'll be back in Saint-Pierre at midnight.

601
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,070
I won't be burning any lights,
so keep a sharp lookout.

602
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,740
One thing, Mr. Morgan.

603
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:04,700
Last night you very definitely refused
to have anything to do with us.

604
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,450
Why have you changed your mind?

605
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,870
I need the money now. Last night I didn't.

606
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:12,000
- If you knew what this means to us....
- I don't want to know.

607
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,630
I'm glad you're on our side.

608
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,540
I'm not. I'm getting paid.

609
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,010
And by the way, I'd like that money now.

610
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,720
If I were you, I do not think
I would trust Mr. Morgan.

611
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,560
Did a doctor look at his leg?

612
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,600
No. They are watching all doctors
who are friendly to us.

613
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,230
- Miss the bone?
- As far as I can tell.

614
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:36,270
He's lucky.
Why did you put a pillow under it?

615
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,610
- Why not?
- It doesn't hurt so much that way.

616
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:40,650
It'll have to hurt, you'll have to take it...

617
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,610
unless you want to take a chance
of gangrene setting in.

618
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,120
All right, I'll take that.

619
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,530
Are you a doctor?

620
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,950
No. But I've handled
quite a lot of gunshot wounds.

621
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,250
You can trust me now.

622
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,670
Good luck, Harry.

623
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,630
It's all right.

624
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,140
- More <i>caf</i>, <i>mademoiselle?</i>
- Please.

625
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,530
- What is that you're playing?
- Did you say something?

626
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,240
What's the name of that tune?

627
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,990
It hasn't got any name yet.
I've just been fooling with the lyrics.

628
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,950
They're not so hot, either.
Would you like to hear them?

629
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:30,040
Sure.

630
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,410
So it goes.

631
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,710
- That's about as far as it goes.
- I like it.

632
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:21,040
Yes. If I could get the right lyrics.

633
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:34,060
- Good morning, Cricket.
- Morning, Harry.

634
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,600
- Good morning, Slim.
- Hello.

635
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,150
- How did you sleep?
- The best in a long time.

636
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,860
- Have some coffee?
- No, thanks. I've had mine.

637
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,780
You were up early. What were you doing?

638
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,530
I was getting you a ticket on the plane
this afternoon. It leaves at 4:00.

639
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:49,570
- Can you make it?
- Sure.

640
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,290
You took that job, didn't you?

641
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,290
See, I figured this way
you wouldn't get your feet wet.

642
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:58,920
Yeah. That's right.

643
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,460
- That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
- Sure.

644
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,790
I just....

645
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,300
- You want me to go, don't you?
- Yes, I want you to go.

646
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,800
Okay, Steve.

647
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,310
Help her get on that plane,
will you, Cricket?

648
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,850
I sure will, Harry.

649
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:19,980
I'm gonna be pretty busy from now on,
so I probably won't see you again.

650
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,480
- If I ever get up your way-
- Yeah. Do that.

651
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,980
I'll leave my address with Frenchy
so you can find me.

652
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:29,320
Maybe I'll know how to whistle by then.

653
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,070
- So long, Slim.
- So long, Steve.

654
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,670
Well, it was nice while it lasted.

655
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,500
Maybe it's better this way, Slim.

656
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,090
I don't know.

657
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:50,880
You haven't known him very long.
He's a funny guy.

658
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:09,700
- How are you, Harry? How's everything?
- Fine. I told you to stay at the hotel.

659
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,280
- I knew you was going out.
- Who told you that?

660
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,950
You can't fool me, Harry.
I knew it just as plain.

661
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:17,790
- Say, could I have a little-
- You're not going.

662
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:21,330
Could I have a little one,
just enough to fill a hen's ear?

663
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,790
- Come on, Eddie. Get off.
- What's the matter?

664
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,300
There's no sense in getting plugged at me.
Take it easy. You got-

665
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,560
I wouldn't do that to you.

666
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,770
You're right, you wouldn't.
I'm not gonna carry you, that's all.

667
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:45,940
- What did you have to hit me for?
- So you'd believe me.

668
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,650
- You ain't treating me square.
- Who do you treat square?

669
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:51,900
You'd double-cross your own mother.
You told me so yourself.

670
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,410
I was only kidding.

671
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,920
Thanks, Harry. I knew you was my pal.

672
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:08,750
- But why won't you carry me?
- Because I don't want you.

673
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,550
You know, you're just plugged.

674
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,800
Never mind, old pal,
you'll be glad to see me yet.

675
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:42,410
All right. Come out of there.

676
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:46,380
It's only me, Harry.

677
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,210
How did you get back on board?

678
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,300
I went up the street for some bottles.

679
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,920
Then I sneaked in
while you was working on the engine.

680
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:56,050
- I knew you'd carry me.
- Carry you, nothing.

681
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,720
If I thought you could swim back
I'd dump you overboard.

682
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,970
You're a joker. We've got to stick together
when we're in trouble.

683
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:06,190
- How do you know I'm in trouble?
- You can't fool me. I always know.

684
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,810
Where we going, Harry?

685
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,730
What would you do
if somebody shot at you?

686
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,440
Shot at me? With a gun?

687
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,990
- Who's gonna shoot at me?
- If you're lucky, nobody.

688
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,580
Where we going? What're we gonna do?

689
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,450
I'll tell you when the time comes.
Get out some tackle.

690
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,250
Aren't you glad you came?

691
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:27,330
No.

692
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:43,020
- Here. Put this on. It's getting cold.
- I'm all right, Harry.

693
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,900
Say, what's going on?

694
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,950
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

695
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,570
Yes, there is, too.
What's all the darn guns for?

696
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:03,540
In case we run into a shark or something.

697
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,200
A shark? At night?

698
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:10,210
Or something?
What do you mean, "or something"?

699
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,460
- Watch your course.
- What's the matter?

700
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,510
We're going on a job.
I'll tell you what to do when it's time.

701
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,590
A job?

702
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:20,390
What kind of a job?
What do you expect me to do?

703
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:22,140
Do you know how to handle this?

704
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:25,060
Of course I know how.
Everybody knows how to handle a gun.

705
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,640
All you do is work the lever
and pull the trigger. You know I know that.

706
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:32,650
Such foolish questions.
Do I know how to handle a gun.

707
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,410
- What do I got to work a gun for?
- I just wondered if you could.

708
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:42,660
You know I can.

709
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,990
Harry, sometimes you act stupid.
Just plain stupid.

710
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,080
Sometimes I think you don't pay
no attention to nothing I say.

711
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,920
Is it gonna be that bad, Harry?

712
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:00,090
I don't know yet.
It all depends on how lucky we are.

713
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,930
That's why you didn't want to carry me.

714
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:11,940
I knew there was some other reason.
You wasn't mad at me at all.

715
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,740
You was afraid I'd get hurt.
You was thinking of me.

716
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,530
Watch your course, Eddie.

717
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:25,280
I feel better now, Harry.
I'll be all right. You'll see.

718
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,300
What's the matter?
What are you looking at me like that for?

719
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:41,970
What are you laughing at?

720
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,760
Just a joke that neither one of us
knows the answer to.

721
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:45,890
What joke?

722
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:47,930
Whether you're gonna hold together
or not.

723
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:51,020
Don't say that, Harry.
I'm a good man. You know I am.

724
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,150
You are, but you're going
all over the ocean. Stay on your course.

725
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,070
Why do you always....

726
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,320
Could I have just one?
I don't want to get the shakes.

727
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,910
Make it a short one.
I want you rum-brave, not useless.

728
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:08,330
Thanks, Harry.

729
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:30,810
What's the matter, Harry?

730
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:52,540
- Who's that? What are we going to do?
- Pick up a couple of guys.

731
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:56,380
Here's what I want you to do.
Take this gun and get back in the stern.

732
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,380
If there's any trouble, start shooting.
But don't shoot me.

733
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,210
Supposing something happens to you?
What do I do then?

734
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,430
How do I know?
You invited yourself on this trip, not me.

735
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,470
All right, get back there.

736
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,500
My name's Harry Morgan.
Beauclere sent me.

737
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,000
Get that light out of my face.

738
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:42,250
- What happened to Beauclere?
- He ran into a little trouble.

739
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,260
- What's your name?
- De Bursac.

740
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,300
That's the name. It's all right, Eddie.

741
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:49,260
Come on aboard.

742
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,220
Wait a minute.
He didn't say anything about a woman.

743
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:54,770
Permit me.
This is my wife, <i>Madame</i> de Bursac.

744
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,230
How do you do?

745
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:58,310
What do you want to bring a....

746
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:05,110
It's your funeral. Let's get out of here.

747
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,090
All right, Eddie. You can relax now.

748
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,970
Don't unload. We're not home yet.

749
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:33,180
If she gets cold,
you can put her down in the cabin.

750
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,560
Mr. Morgan, just who are you?

751
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,980
I own this boat. Beauclere's paying me
to get you people back to Martinique.

752
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,610
You're not one of us.
You're not on our side.

753
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,530
I don't understand.

754
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,320
I don't understand
what kind of a war you're fighting...

755
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,700
lugging your wives with you.
Don't you get enough of them at home?

756
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,080
- You say you're being paid for this.
- That's right.

757
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,870
Then I suggest you stop talking
and take us to Martinique.

758
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,210
That's where we're heading right now.

759
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,700
- What's the matter, Harry?
- Keep quiet.

760
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:34,200
I thought I saw something out there.

761
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:37,830
Listen.

762
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,380
- What is it?
- I don't know.

763
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,670
Shut up. You hear that?

764
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,420
Is it the patrol boat?

765
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,720
Don't you know those engines?
Sounds like she's off there.

766
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,640
Stand by that wheel.
Wait a minute. Give me that gun.

767
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:03,690
You can't fight them guys, Harry.

768
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,150
What's the matter with you?

769
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:07,400
You ought to be telling me
how good you are.

770
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,940
I can do it. What do you want me to do?

771
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,450
If we're lucky, nothing. If we're not,
hook her up and get away from here fast.

772
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:17,580
- What does this mean, Mr. Morgan?
- Trouble, if they see us.

773
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,120
- What can we do?
- You can't do anything.

774
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,080
Just get down on the deck, flat,
and stay there.

775
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,830
But I don't know what good it'll do.

776
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,920
- If you try to resist, we will be killed.
- Shut up, both of you.

777
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,710
Get down on the deck, flat.

778
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,420
You save France. I want to save my boat.

779
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:35,550
Hook her up, Eddie. Let's go.

780
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:39,970
Don't shoot!

781
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:01,950
We got lucky again.

782
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,790
Ease her off and put her on 160
and then get that first-aid kit.

783
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:17,720
That's not so bad.

784
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,560
You wouldn't have that
if you weren't so anxious to give up.

785
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,270
Please help me get him on the seat.

786
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,890
Leave him. I don't want him
bleeding over my cushion.

787
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,690
- Here you are, Harry.
- You can have a drink now.

788
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,150
Thanks, Harry.

789
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,280
Help me off with his coat.

790
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:35,400
Easy now, boy.

791
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,590
All right. Get ready.

792
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,090
The man in that boat
will take you on from here.

793
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,010
But I don't understand.

794
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:57,800
Some people spent a lot of time
figuring this thing out.

795
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:00,010
They know more about it than we do.

796
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,030
This is de Bursac.

797
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,450
He's the other guy
I was supposed to pick up. His wife.

798
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,490
- My name is Gerard.
- How do you do?

799
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:21,370
- Easy with him. He's been shot up a little.
- What happened?

800
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:24,200
We ran into a patrol boat.
They'll tell you about it.

801
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,080
I'll cruise around
and give you a chance to get ashore.

802
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:31,840
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

803
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,360
Good evening, Mama.

804
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:03,830
- I thought you said she pulled out.
- I thought she did.

805
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,930
Hello, Steve.

806
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:23,100
You were going to put her on a plane.

807
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,350
- What's the matter? Didn't it go?
- It went. But I decided not to.

808
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:29,600
You did? I went to a lot of trouble
to get you out of here.

809
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:31,560
- That's why I didn't go.
- Yeah.

810
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:36,230
You dames.
A guy goes out and breaks his neck to....

811
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:39,030
I might have expected it.

812
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:43,820
You're not sore, are you?

813
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:47,120
- It'd be all right-
- I got a refund on that ticket. Here.

814
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,370
That's gonna help a lot.
You better hang onto it.

815
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:51,210
- We can use-
- She'll buy it for you.

816
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:53,380
- Nothing but beer for him.
- I'll remember.

817
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,500
We'll be all right. I've got a job.

818
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:58,960
- Doing what?
- Frenchy seems to think I can sing.

819
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:00,630
It's his place.

820
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,220
Sometimes you make me so mad I could-

821
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,470
You could do what?

822
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,050
Harry, I need your help.

823
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:07,640
What is it now?

824
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,930
That's all right. Go ahead.

825
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,980
That man is very badly wounded, Harry.

826
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:15,110
I looked at him. The bullet hit the gunnel,
it was almost spent.

827
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:17,860
- All you got to do is take it out.
- Could you do it?

828
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:21,490
Me? I'm hotter than any doctor.
They would have recognized my boat.

829
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:22,740
They'll be on my tail soon.

830
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:25,870
- All I got to do is walk out of here.
- You don't have to go out.

831
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,490
- You didn't bring them here?
- In the cellar.

832
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,080
Why didn't you put them
in a goldfish bowl and be done with it?

833
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,670
We had to do something.
They're watching every road out of town.

834
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:38,090
See what you got yourself into
by sticking around?

835
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,760
I'm ready to go any time you are.

836
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,970
- Please, Harry, will you do it?
- Not a chance, Frenchy.

837
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:46,680
Your bill here at the hotel, being overdue...

838
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,850
amounts to 6,356 francs.

839
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:51,930
She's right, Eddie.

840
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,060
You really keep the books, don't you?

841
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:58,150
We'll be glad to dismiss the whole matter
if you will do this for us.

842
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,400
- Throw her bill in, too?
- Sure thing.

843
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:04,490
- All I got to do is take the bullet out-
- That's all.

844
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,700
You almost had me figured right, Mama,
except for one thing.

845
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,200
I'll still owe you that bill.

846
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,000
Up in my room you'll find a medical kit.

847
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,210
It's gray, this big,
has the boat's name on it.

848
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,210
- Bring it to the cellar.
- Sure.

849
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:18,420
Here's the key. Bring some hot water, too.

850
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,880
This way, Harry.

851
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,300
Can I help?

852
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,180
Just stay out of sight.
If you run across the police...

853
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:30,640
- don't forget what I told you to tell them.
- What was that, Harry?

854
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,680
Just stay out of sight, Eddie.

855
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:35,390
I remember.

856
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:02,050
What do you want here?

857
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,420
I'll tell you. I was sort of invited.
He asked me.

858
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:05,840
- You're not a doctor.
- No.

859
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,720
- Where's the doctor?
- Please, be patient.

860
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,180
I have been patient.
How do I know you know anything?

861
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,390
- You don't.
- Wait a minute.

862
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,200
How long has he been unconscious?

863
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,740
Just a few minutes.

864
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:47,260
He's got some fever
and his pulse is a little low.

865
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,430
He'll be all right
when we get the bullet out.

866
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:52,600
- Don't touch him. Do you hear?
- That's okay. I'm not getting paid.

867
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,060
She doesn't know what she's saying.
She's not herself.

868
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,560
- Who is she?
- Harry, you promised.

869
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:01,650
You want to help your husband, don't you?
Then use your head.

870
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:04,070
We can't get a doctor
without giving the show away.

871
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,820
Besides, he's got as good a chance
with me as anybody.

872
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,400
I'm not going to let you do it.

873
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:10,490
Why not?
He's no different from anybody else.

874
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:14,240
Just a little sicker, that's all.
It means he's not worth so much.

875
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:20,500
You can have another crack at me later on.

876
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:22,000
- Hello, Slim.
- Hello.

877
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,590
Miss Browning, <i>Madame</i> de Bursac.

878
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,300
Don't get tough with Slim.
She's apt to slap you back.

879
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,760
That's what you said you'd do, wasn't it?

880
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:30,630
Bring the water in here.

881
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,850
- Wait a minute....
- He's trying to help you.

882
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,970
- Who are you?
- Nobody. Just another volunteer.

883
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,100
- Where do you want this water?
- In that basin.

884
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:44,520
- Is it hot?
- Boiling.

885
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:50,200
All right, then.
Pour some of this in it. And drop these in.

886
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,540
- Get out of here. You may not like this.
- I'll be all right.

887
01:05:58,290 --> 01:05:59,540
Then take this.

888
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,170
- What is it?
- Chloroform.

889
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:05,170
Get over by his head.
If he comes to while I'm probing...

890
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:08,510
pour some of it on a hunk of cotton
and give him a whiff of it.

891
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,180
Don't open it till I tell you to.

892
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:14,510
Take out about four of those.

893
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,600
George, bring that lamp a little closer
so I can see what I'm doing.

894
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:32,110
That's good.

895
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:37,660
All right, Slim.

896
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,290
Hold that a minute.

897
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,670
Easy, boy.

898
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:54,760
All right, open that can
and give him some.

899
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,510
George, see if you can hold his head down.

900
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,060
Come on, hurry up.

901
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:04,560
That's fine. Don't worry about her.
Pick up that can.

902
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:09,070
- Any of it left?
- I think there's enough.

903
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:16,450
Wait a minute, I don't think we'll need it.
He's out, too.

904
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:19,790
Bring that lamp down a little lower.

905
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:23,460
Frenchy, bring that basin over here.

906
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,550
And fan some of those fumes away,
will you, or we'll all be out.

907
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:48,230
There you are, Frenchy, there's your bullet.

908
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:51,730
I told you it was spent.
It would have smashed the bone.

909
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:53,740
All right, I don't need that.

910
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,420
All right, you finish bandaging it up.
Adhesive tape in the box.

911
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,180
I got to get nursie out of here,
or she never will come to.

912
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:31,270
What are you trying to do,
guess her weight?

913
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:33,610
She's heftier than you think.

914
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:43,120
- You'd better loosen her clothes.
- You've been doing all right.

915
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,290
Maybe you'd better
look after her husband.

916
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,210
- He's not gonna run out on me.
- Neither is she.

917
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:01,800
Is it all right
if I give her a little whiff of this?

918
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,490
You're with us again.

919
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:23,620
You were lucky. You passed out.

920
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,080
What happened? We must....

921
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:31,170
We'll talk about that in the morning.
See if you can get some sleep.

922
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:33,420
Thanks.

923
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:53,940
Why did you ever come along with him
on a trip like this?

924
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:57,860
I love him. I want to be with him.

925
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,610
- That's a reason.
- There's another reason.

926
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:06,080
They told me to come, our people did.

927
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:13,830
They said no man was much good
if he left someone behind in France...

928
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,300
for the Germans to find and hold.

929
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:22,220
- That makes sense.
- I told them I'd only be in the way...

930
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:25,510
that I could do no good, that I was afraid.

931
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:32,060
But the worst of it is that it's been so hard
for him to have me along...

932
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:38,150
because I've made him that way, too.
Now he's afraid.

933
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,070
He didn't invent it.

934
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,870
- Invent what?
- Being afraid.

935
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,500
Thanks, Mr. Morgan.

936
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,560
The fever's gone.

937
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:13,810
Do you....

938
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:16,770
I'm no doctor,
but he looks pretty good to me.

939
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:21,820
If he wakes up,
give him another one of these pills.

940
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,550
- Mr. Morgan, I....
- You're not gonna faint again?

941
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:46,130
No, I'm just having a hard time
trying to say something.

942
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,720
Go ahead, say it. I'm not gonna bite you.

943
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:52,560
If it hadn't been for you,
Paul might have....

944
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,770
I'm sorry for the way I've acted.

945
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:59,690
You're not sorry at all, you're just sorry
you made a fool of yourself.

946
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:01,980
I have, haven't I?

947
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:08,320
You don't make me angry
when you say that.

948
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,490
I don't think I'll ever be angry again
with anything you say.

949
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:15,790
Another screwy dame.
Now, how can you....

950
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:19,840
Good morning. I hate to break this up,
but I've brought some breakfast.

951
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,920
- Good morning.
- How's your patient?

952
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:26,840
- He'll be all right-
- Or haven't you looked lately?

953
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:30,350
He'll be all right. I'll be back this evening.

954
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:33,520
- If you need me before then, call me.
- I will.

955
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,060
Yes, and I hope you have everything
you need here.

956
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:37,810
The eggs may be a little hardboiled-

957
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:41,480
- That's all right, I like them that way.
- You're lucky. Isn't she?

958
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:50,450
I'm gonna get some sleep,
I'll see you later.

959
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:56,040
Thanks.

960
01:12:57,410 --> 01:13:00,130
- What do you want?
- I could use a match.

961
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:12,050
Thanks. Now I need a cigarette.

962
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:26,280
Here, I can do that. Come on, let me help.

963
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,860
When I get ready to take my shoes off,
I'll take them off myself.

964
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,370
All right.

965
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,870
- Want something to eat?
- No.

966
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:40,210
- Just a little breakfast?
- All I want to do is get some sleep.

967
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:43,090
It's a good idea. I can help you there.

968
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:47,880
- Now where are you going?
- I'm going to fix you a nice hot bath.

969
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,090
It'll make you sleep better.

970
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:53,850
I don't want you to take my shoes off,
I don't want you to get me breakfast...

971
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,930
I don't want you to draw me a hot bath...

972
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:59,100
- I don't want you to-
- Isn't there anything I can do, Steve?

973
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:01,730
- Yes, get the-
- You know, Mr. Morgan...

974
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:04,360
you don't make me angry
when you say that.

975
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:08,150
I don't think I'll ever be angry again
at anything you say.

976
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:14,740
How am I doing, Steve,
does it work the second time?

977
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:17,910
You've been wanting
to do something for me, haven't you?

978
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:25,790
Walk around me.

979
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,960
Go ahead, walk around me, clear around.

980
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:43,020
- Did you find anything?
- No.

981
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:48,780
No, Steve.
There are no strings tied to you, not yet.

982
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,000
I like that...

983
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:10,960
except for the beard.

984
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:14,510
Why don't you shave...

985
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:18,430
and we'll try it again.

986
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,980
- Later, Frenchy.
- Harry, wait.

987
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:28,820
Renard, the Inspector, is downstairs.
You better come down.

988
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,610
- I can't do that, I got to shave.
- He's got Eddie.

989
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:35,240
He's giving him drinks
and asking him questions.

990
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,030
I was afraid of that.

991
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,040
Good thing you didn't get me in that tub.

992
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:43,960
Look out for those strings, Steve.
You're liable to trip and break your neck.

993
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:47,920
- Strings? I didn't see any strings.
- They just don't show, Frenchy.

994
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,380
You ought to have seen that fish.

995
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:54,630
It must have weighed 900
if it weighed a pound.

996
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:57,550
It was the biggest marlin you ever seen
in all your born days.

997
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,300
You know, a marlin is a swordfish.

998
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:02,390
- Good morning, <i>Capitaine</i>.
- Hello, Harry. How's everything?

999
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:04,060
- Fine.
- Won't you join us?

1000
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:06,440
It's a little early for this kind of a party.

1001
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,650
Continue, Mr. Eddie.

1002
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,650
Did you hear that? He called me mister.

1003
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:11,400
Say, you're all right.

1004
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:14,700
- Was you ever bit by a-
- No, he never was, Eddie.

1005
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,450
Go on with what you were saying.

1006
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:20,080
I was just telling him about the big one
we hooked onto last night.

1007
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:23,750
Sir, that fish was so big
that me and Harry could hardly budge him.

1008
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:26,500
We pumped on him
until we was all wore out, didn't we?

1009
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:28,080
That's right, Eddie.

1010
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,920
It was after dark
and we was still playing him.

1011
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,220
He must have weighed
at least 1,000 easy.

1012
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:40,430
Every time Mr. Eddie takes a drink,
this fabulous fish grows larger.

1013
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,180
He must have started
with a pretty small one.

1014
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,520
How did you finally manage
to land such a leviathan?

1015
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,230
We didn't, didn't he tell you?

1016
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:50,940
- We ran into a German submarine.
- A German submarine?

1017
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:53,440
Whatever it was,
it turned its light on and fired.

1018
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:55,490
- I didn't wait to find out.
- I do not think-

1019
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:57,860
You know,
you can't be too careful these days.

1020
01:16:57,950 --> 01:17:00,950
I do not think anybody
could give a more logical explanation...

1021
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:04,290
for refusing to obey the challenge
of our patrol boat.

1022
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:07,290
Not to speak of shooting out
their searchlight.

1023
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:08,620
- Patrol boat?
- Yes.

1024
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,460
That's what it was. You were right, Eddie.

1025
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:12,540
I'm a good man in the dark, always was.

1026
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:15,960
Funny, he kept saying it was a patrol boat,
but I wouldn't believe him.

1027
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:19,300
There is one thing that is not clear to me,
Capt. Morgan.

1028
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:20,760
What's that?

1029
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:24,470
Why does a professional fisherman
go fishing for his own amusement?

1030
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,810
Don't you ever ask any questions?
Don't you ever talk?

1031
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:33,690
No, I guess you don't.
What were you saying?

1032
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:37,820
Does a professional fisherman
go fishing for his own amusement?

1033
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:40,700
He does if he likes it, and we do, don't we?

1034
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:42,820
Yeah, remember in Key West
when we went-

1035
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:46,580
- We don't seem to be getting anywhere.
- It was the Fourth of July-

1036
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,040
I was just saying,
Key West, the Fourth of July...

1037
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,000
three years ago at 8:00. I got that in.

1038
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,290
- What about your passengers?
- It was 7:00.

1039
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:55,750
You oughtn't to burn up at him,
you fed him the rum.

1040
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,510
- What about your two passengers?
- What passengers?

1041
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,430
The ones you brought from Anguilla.

1042
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:02,760
He was waiting on the dock
when we came in.

1043
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:04,680
You think I got them ashore in my sleeve?

1044
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,470
You could have landed them anywhere
on our coastline.

1045
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,980
Right, I could've at that.

1046
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:12,730
- Would $500 refresh your memory?
- My memory's pretty good.

1047
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:16,360
I remember that you're the guy
who lifted my passport and my money.

1048
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:20,200
Would your memory become any better if
your passport and money were returned?

1049
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,700
Does that include the $825
Johnson owed me?

1050
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:25,370
- Why not?
- And the $500 you just mentioned?

1051
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:28,250
You drive a hard bargain,
<i>Capitaine</i> Morgan.

1052
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:31,170
That's no bargain.
If these people are so important...

1053
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:35,210
- they're gonna be pretty hard to find.
- Not for a man of your resourcefulness.

1054
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:37,710
Think it over and let me hear from you.

1055
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:51,940
- Did you hear all of that?
- Most of it.

1056
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,770
Bee lips went away pretty mad.

1057
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,610
When he cools off, though,
he's gonna start thinking.

1058
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:59,070
He thinks now that you will turn them in.

1059
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:02,490
- Isn't that what you want him to think?
- What will happen then?

1060
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:04,950
- He hasn't searched this hotel yet, has he?
- Not yet.

1061
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:06,120
There's your answer.

1062
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,040
He doesn't want them,
but the whole setup.

1063
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:10,500
- What shall we do?
- It's not we, it's you.

1064
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,830
You can't do anything until that fella
gets strong enough to move.

1065
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,080
Until then, you're probably safe.

1066
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,790
Better get rid of this.

1067
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,710
- Bring us some breakfast.
- Sure.

1068
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:22,720
- I thought you didn't want any breakfast.
- I didn't then.

1069
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,590
- What were you saying, Eddie?
- I've been figuring.

1070
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:29,770
Them guys don't think that I'm wise,
but they was trying to get me drunk.

1071
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,680
They don't know me, do they, Harry?

1072
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,610
I think they're trying
to find out something.

1073
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:38,770
What do you suppose it is?

1074
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:41,030
- Don't you know?
- I ain't got no idea.

1075
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,700
That's a good way to leave it.
You got the hiccups.

1076
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:46,160
Have I, Harry? Yeah, I never noticed.

1077
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:49,030
- You better take a drink of water.
- What, water?

1078
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,950
- That's a good idea, Slim.
- No, not that.

1079
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,330
- It'll do you good.
- I'll be all right.

1080
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,630
- Eddie.
- Yeah, Harry?

1081
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:00,050
Keep out of sight
and stay away from the police.

1082
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:03,170
They won't believe
that story you told a second time.

1083
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:05,010
What story was that, Harry?

1084
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:07,930
Keep out of sight.

1085
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,880
Seen Eddie around?

1086
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:08,800
No, sir, Mr. Morgan,
I've not seen him all evening.

1087
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:10,470
Where's Frenchy?

1088
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:51,470
I'm going to work. Do you like it?

1089
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:54,050
You won't have to sing much
in that outfit.

1090
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:56,850
- You know, sometimes you make me-
- That's why I do it.

1091
01:22:56,930 --> 01:23:00,020
- Haven't seen Eddie, have you?
- No, not since noon, why?

1092
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,100
He left the boat and hasn't come back.

1093
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:04,520
- Is there anything wrong?
- I don't know.

1094
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,650
Don't look now,
but over there at the second table...

1095
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:10,740
there's a guy with a mustache.
I think he's following me.

1096
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:13,700
Keep an eye on him, will you?
I'm going downstairs.

1097
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:16,620
Stick around awhile, she's going to sing.

1098
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,830
- I'll be right back.
- Give her my love.

1099
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:21,250
I'd give her my own if she had that on.

1100
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:24,370
Here's the rest of the lyrics, Slim.
How do you feel?

1101
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:27,340
- I could use a drink, Cricket.
- Sure, come on.

1102
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:32,010
- What will you have, Slim?
- Scotch and soda.

1103
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:33,550
Same.

1104
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,730
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Capt. Morgan.

1105
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:49,610
- How are you feeling?
- Much better. I'm very grateful to you.

1106
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:52,190
Forget it. Let me have a look at this.

1107
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:56,820
- There's no bleeding.
- No.

1108
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:00,240
- Does that hurt?
- Very little.

1109
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:03,620
My only trouble is when I'm eating.
I'm awkward with my left hand.

1110
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:07,540
We'll see if we can have you shot
in the other arm next time.

1111
01:24:07,670 --> 01:24:09,500
You won't need me anymore.

1112
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,300
Frenchy, I'm pulling out.

1113
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:13,800
- When?
- Soon as I find Eddie.

1114
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,430
- Is your friend missing?
- Yeah.

1115
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:16,550
What happened?

1116
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,930
I don't know,
he left the dock and hasn't been back.

1117
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:21,930
- Usually does what I tell him.
- I'm sorry if anything happened.

1118
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:25,020
- I won't know until I find him.
- Couldn't you leave him here?

1119
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:26,940
I don't think Eddie would like that.

1120
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,650
Frenchy, as soon as I'm gone...

1121
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:31,150
Renard will move in
and turn this place upside down...

1122
01:24:31,230 --> 01:24:34,490
so you better start figuring
how and where you're gonna move him.

1123
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:38,120
- Wouldn't it be best if we went with you?
- Why do you want to go?

1124
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:42,040
I'm still trying to get out of the jam
I got into bringing you here.

1125
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,870
Why'd you come here in the first place?

1126
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:46,870
I know why she came, she told me,
but why did you?

1127
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,830
Have you heard of Pierre Villemars?

1128
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:52,840
Pierre Villemars? Yeah, I read a headline.
He was quite a guy.

1129
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:55,380
- Vichy got him. He's dead, isn't he?
- No.

1130
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:58,260
He's on Devil's Island.
They sent me here to get him...

1131
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:00,260
to bring him back here to Martinique.

1132
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:03,270
He's a man whom people
who are persecuted and oppressed...

1133
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:05,140
will believe in and follow.

1134
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,020
Just how are you gonna get him away?

1135
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,440
You don't think much of me,
Capt. Morgan.

1136
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:16,990
You're wondering why they've chosen me
for this mission.

1137
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:18,450
I wonder, too.

1138
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:21,530
As you know, I'm not a brave man.

1139
01:25:23,370 --> 01:25:25,830
On the contrary, I'm always frightened.

1140
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:30,040
I wish I could borrow your nature
for a while, Captain.

1141
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:32,460
When you meet danger,
you never think of anything...

1142
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:34,670
except how you will circumvent it.

1143
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,510
The word failure
does not even exist for you, while I....

1144
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:43,810
I think always, "Suppose I fail"...

1145
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:46,730
and then I am frightened.

1146
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:50,060
Yeah, I can easily see how
it wouldn't take much courage...

1147
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:52,520
to get a notorious patriot
off Devil's Island.

1148
01:25:52,610 --> 01:25:57,150
But just for professional reasons,
I'd like to know how you're gonna do it.

1149
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,860
We will find a way.

1150
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,070
It might fail, and if it does...

1151
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:05,540
and I am still alive...

1152
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:10,250
I will try to pass on my information,
my mission, to someone else.

1153
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:13,340
Perhaps to a better man,
who does not fail.

1154
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:16,000
Because there is always someone else.

1155
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,130
That is the mistake
the Germans always make...

1156
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:22,260
with people they try to destroy.

1157
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:26,220
There will be always someone else.

1158
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:31,770
Originally, we planned
to do everything from here.

1159
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:35,230
But then, because of my own clumsiness,
it was impossible.

1160
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:38,440
And that's the reason
we have to go with you.

1161
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:41,780
I couldn't get you on the dock,
there's a man there watching...

1162
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:44,030
there's one upstairs, they're everywhere.

1163
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:47,240
- How would I get you through the streets?
- How will you go?

1164
01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:49,000
They're watching me to find you.

1165
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:52,370
As long as I haven't got you along,
I can at least get on the boat.

1166
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:55,290
There'll be a fog,
and the tide will turn after midnight.

1167
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:57,750
I can cut loose,
drift out beyond the breakwater...

1168
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,550
before I start my engines.

1169
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,630
I'll still have trouble enough,
even without you.

1170
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,970
- But, Harry-
- Capt. Morgan is right.

1171
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,600
This is not his fight yet.

1172
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:13,850
Some day I hope it may be,
because we could use him.

1173
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,320
You have done enough for us already.

1174
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:21,150
Gerard told me of your refusing
Renard's offer to give us up.

1175
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:24,320
How do you know I won't do it yet?

1176
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:27,240
There are many things a man will do...

1177
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:32,080
but betrayal for a price is not one of yours.

1178
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,340
Good luck.

1179
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:39,670
- I hope you find your friend.
- Thanks.

1180
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,470
Goodbye, and thanks.

1181
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,640
Frenchy, I got a few things
to talk to you about before I blow.

1182
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,180
Then I'll be up in a little while, Harry.

1183
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:58,020
Any sign of Eddie?

1184
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:01,990
- Your friend's still sitting at his table.
- I know.

1185
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:04,740
- What's the matter, Steve?
- I don't know.

1186
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:07,370
I think the whole thing's gonna blow up,
it's too quiet.

1187
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:09,660
- What will you do?
- We'll leave tonight...

1188
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:11,370
as soon as I find Eddie.

1189
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:14,710
We're leaving here for good,
the three of us.

1190
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:17,920
Wait, I want you to know
what you're getting into.

1191
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,090
It'll be rough, I'm broke. If we get out...

1192
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:22,800
it'll be with a few hundred gallons of gas
and a few francs.

1193
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,220
Just enough to get us
to Port-au-Prince maybe.

1194
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,890
I've never been there.

1195
01:28:27,390 --> 01:28:30,890
I don't know when you'll get back home.
It could be a long time.

1196
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:33,930
It could be forever,
or are you afraid of that?

1197
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:38,270
I'm hard to get, Steve.
All you have to do is ask me.

1198
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:41,780
How long will it take you to pack?

1199
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,860
There's a lot of people around here,
save it.

1200
01:28:48,910 --> 01:28:52,120
We won't shove off till midnight.
Go ahead and go to work.

1201
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,130
- All set, Slim?
- Sure, but don't make it sad, Cricket.

1202
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:03,460
- I don't feel that way.
- You don't look that way, either. Let's go.

1203
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:05,090
Top note, boys.

1204
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,070
<i>Madame</i> de Bursac wants to see you.

1205
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:52,910
- Look, Frenchy, that's all over.
- She's up in your room.

1206
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:54,200
Why did you....

1207
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:56,660
Please, Harry, that's all I will ask.

1208
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:59,370
Thanks, Harry.

1209
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,170
You shouldn't have come, it's too risky.

1210
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:07,420
I told you I can't take you.

1211
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:11,260
I didn't come up for that.
You've already done too much for us...

1212
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:13,890
but there's just one other favor
I'd like to ask.

1213
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:15,850
I want you to take these.

1214
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:18,600
They were my grandmother's,
and her mother's before that.

1215
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:22,440
She gave them to me when I got married.
They're all I've got left.

1216
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:25,900
I want you to take them out of here
and save them till we can-

1217
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,900
Suppose they get me before I get out?

1218
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:31,110
Then throw them overboard,
at least they won't have them.

1219
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:33,450
Suppose you never come for them?

1220
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:36,450
Then let it be a part payment
for all you've done for us.

1221
01:31:36,530 --> 01:31:37,910
Please, won't you?

1222
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:41,250
Steve, Renard just came in,
he's on his way up.

1223
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:43,460
- Did he see you?
- I don't think so.

1224
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:49,090
All right, you take these,
both of you get in there and keep quiet.

1225
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:51,720
As soon as I get rid of him,
take her back to the cellar.

1226
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:52,880
All right.

1227
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:05,150
Good evening, may we come in?

1228
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:11,530
Good evening.

1229
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,990
No, I never carry them.

1230
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:16,950
What's on your mind?

1231
01:32:17,030 --> 01:32:19,580
The whereabouts of the two people
we are searching for.

1232
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:21,330
- You haven't found them yet?
- No.

1233
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:25,080
But since morning, through our sources,
we've learned their names...

1234
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:28,790
<i>Monsieur</i> and <i>Madame</i> de Bursac.
That is correct, is it not?

1235
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,880
- How would I know that?
- I thought perhaps....

1236
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:35,970
Very nice perfume.

1237
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,680
- You like that?
- Yes.

1238
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:43,680
So do I. All right, Slim, come out.

1239
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:50,480
- You've met the boys.
- Good evening.

1240
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:54,440
<i>Mademoiselle.</i> Now we are all here.

1241
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:59,200
Except your friend, Mr. Eddie,
as he likes to be called.

1242
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:05,540
- So you got him.
- Yes.

1243
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:07,880
Now we lack only
the two missing persons.

1244
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:09,210
What're you gonna do with him?

1245
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:12,840
If you will not give us
the information we want, perhaps he will.

1246
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:15,840
Before we made the mistake
of giving him liquor...

1247
01:33:15,970 --> 01:33:17,550
this time we will withhold it.

1248
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:19,640
- You know what that'll do to him?
- I think so.

1249
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:23,140
- He couldn't stand it, he'd crack up.
- You could easily prevent that.

1250
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:24,600
Yeah, I can.

1251
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:27,770
You got a cigarette?

1252
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:33,070
- Can't you make him talk?
- When necessary.

1253
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:37,780
You'll find some in that drawer, Slim.

1254
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:43,330
You could save Mr. Eddie a great deal of,
shall we say, discomfort?

1255
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:49,630
And me a lot of time,
if you will tell us where these people are.

1256
01:33:56,970 --> 01:33:58,840
How much were you going to give me?

1257
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:00,550
More than what's mine already?

1258
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:04,220
I do not think now
I will have to pay anybody anything.

1259
01:34:07,770 --> 01:34:09,350
You're probably right.

1260
01:34:11,610 --> 01:34:13,900
- I haven't got a match.
- Don't go any....

1261
01:34:15,570 --> 01:34:17,990
All right, go on, get them up. Go on.

1262
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:21,160
Pull your guns, go ahead.

1263
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,990
Get them out. Go ahead and try it!

1264
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:28,660
- You're gonna get it, anyway.
- Don't.

1265
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:30,710
You've been pushing me around
long enough.

1266
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:34,380
You were gonna drive Eddie nuts.
Picking on a poor old rummy that never....

1267
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:37,170
Slapping girls around.
That's right, go for it!

1268
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:39,970
Your boy needs company.

1269
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:51,140
Look at that, ain't that silly?

1270
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:56,190
That's how close you came.

1271
01:34:57,690 --> 01:34:59,860
All right, Frenchy, get their guns.

1272
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:12,750
Here you are.

1273
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:21,430
Now get over on that couch.
Go ahead, step over him.

1274
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,470
Sit down.

1275
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:32,060
All right, come on out.

1276
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:37,400
That's one of them,
the other one's in the cellar.

1277
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:39,070
Take her down, get some help.

1278
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:41,820
Have them ready to leave on the boat,
then come back here.

1279
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:44,240
Slim, you pack.
We'll leave as soon as we get Eddie.

1280
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:45,320
Okay, Steve.

1281
01:35:45,450 --> 01:35:47,450
- Just how do you think you-
- Shut up.

1282
01:35:47,530 --> 01:35:50,410
You want to know
how I'm gonna get him out?

1283
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,420
That broke as easy as you will.

1284
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:54,920
There's a phone in the hall.

1285
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,590
You're gonna tell someone to let him go,
send him here.

1286
01:35:57,670 --> 01:35:59,670
Yes, you are, one of you.

1287
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:04,010
I haven't forgotten you.

1288
01:36:05,970 --> 01:36:08,510
You'll both take a beating
till someone uses that phone.

1289
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:10,930
So one of you
is gonna take a beating for nothing.

1290
01:36:11,020 --> 01:36:14,850
I don't care which one it is.
I'll start with you.

1291
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:19,440
You will release him immediately.

1292
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:24,950
- Tell him you'll explain later.
- I will explain it later.

1293
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:29,120
Tell him to send him back to the hotel
and do nothing else till you get there.

1294
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:33,460
Send him back here to the hotel
and do nothing until you hear from us.

1295
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:40,590
All right, inside.
You've got some harbor passes to fill out.

1296
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:46,260
And now Paul and <i>Madame</i> de Bursac.

1297
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:51,720
I'll be right with you, Frenchy.

1298
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:04,320
- They're all yours now.
- Thanks, Mr. Morgan.

1299
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:06,820
They are all ready.

1300
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:09,070
These will get them past the guard
and on the boat.

1301
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:10,740
Where will you take them?

1302
01:37:10,830 --> 01:37:12,490
- Maybe Devil's Island.
- What?

1303
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:15,250
Might even get Villemars off,
wasn't that what you wanted?

1304
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:18,500
Very much. Why are you doing this, Harry?

1305
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:21,630
I don't know.

1306
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:25,300
Maybe because I like you,
maybe because I don't like them.

1307
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:27,840
I'm glad you are on our side, Harry.

1308
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:29,680
No kissing, Frenchy.

1309
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:34,180
- You'll have to take care of those guys.
- We will give you plenty of time.

1310
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:37,020
If you let them go,
they'll come back and burn this place.

1311
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:39,230
Let them, it will be a very small fire.

1312
01:37:39,310 --> 01:37:43,480
When Villemars comes back,
it'll be our turn. We'll start a bigger one.

1313
01:37:43,570 --> 01:37:45,070
Meet you on the boat.

1314
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,820
One minute, please.

1315
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:50,030
That's all right, let him through.

1316
01:37:53,370 --> 01:37:56,290
- How are you, Harry? How's everything?
- It's all right now.

1317
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:59,040
You look glad to see me.
You know a funny thing-

1318
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:02,090
Don't know what they wanted,
but they wouldn't give me-

1319
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:05,300
I'll get you one down on the boat.
We're leaving, Eddie.

1320
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,170
- Ready, Slim?
- In a minute, Steve.

1321
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:08,720
Close that, will you?

1322
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,220
- Say, what is this, is she going with us?
- Yeah, it looks like it.

1323
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:14,470
Harry, you mean.... What's she got....

1324
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:18,350
- Who are you?
- Was you ever bit by a dead bee?

1325
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:20,900
- Was you?
- Yeah.

1326
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:22,860
You got to be careful of dead bees.

1327
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:24,940
They can sting you just as bad
as live ones.

1328
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:27,780
Especially if they was kind of mad
when they got killed.

1329
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,740
I feel like I was talking to myself.

1330
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:32,370
I bet I've been bit 100 times that way.

1331
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:37,250
- Why don't you bite them back?
- I would. Only I haven't got a stinger.

1332
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:42,790
I remember you. You're all right.
She can come, it's okay with me.

1333
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,590
I'll have both of you to take care of.

1334
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:47,760
That's right, Eddie.
You can begin by grabbing these bags.

1335
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,300
Come on, Slim.

1336
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,570
Do I have time to say goodbye to Cricket?

1337
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:12,070
Sure, go ahead.

1338
01:39:20,290 --> 01:39:21,870
- I came to say goodbye.
- What?

1339
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:24,670
We're leaving now. Thanks for everything.

1340
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:28,130
- Hey, Slim. Are you still happy?
- What do you think?
