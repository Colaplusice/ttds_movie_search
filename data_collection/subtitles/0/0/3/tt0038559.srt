1
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,473
<i>To me, a dollar was a dollar</i>
<i>in any language.</i>

2
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,117
<i>On my first night in Argentina,</i>
<i>I didn't know about the locals.</i>

3
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,515
<i>But I knew about American sailors.</i>
<i>I knew I'd better get out of there.</i>

4
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,829
Put your hands up.
Up!

5
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,717
Get going.

6
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,679
- A cane like that is handy.
- It is a faithful friend.

7
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,832
Mostly silent,
but talks when I need it to.

8
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,471
That's your idea of a friend?
You must lead a gay life.

9
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,998
- I lead the life I like to lead.
- You're a lucky man.

10
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,355
- What are you doing here?
- Saving your life.

11
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,196
- He only wanted the money.
- But you'd not have parted with it.

12
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,832
- I don't think I would.
- How did you get the money?

13
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,790
- Gambling.
- I'll leave you here.

14
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:39,193
I'll do the same for you
some time... give you a cigarette.

15
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,551
Why not try some real gambling?

16
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,555
- Isn't it illegal in Buenos Aires?
- Yes.

17
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,192
There's a casino on the
other side of town. Here's the key.

18
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,195
But don't go. They won't let you
use your own dice.

19
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,992
- I didn't think it showed.
- I make my own luck, as you do.

20
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,837
In any event,
they won't let you in without a tie.

21
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,395
The spot is not on your nose, yet.

22
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,756
- Who is he?
- A loafer.

23
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,199
Would you like a fine perfume,
suitable for nobility?

24
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,672
We have a talcum powder
as soft as raw silk.

25
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,551
- Towel?
- Thank you.

26
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,552
- Hey, who's she?
- A harpy.

27
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,636
- How would you classify me?
- Peasant.

28
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,109
Place your bets.

29
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,274
Place your bets,
ladies and gentlemen.

30
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,717
- Number 2. 1,000 pesos.
- No more bets.

31
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,114
Number two, black.

32
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,353
Place your bets,
ladies and gentlemen.

33
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,550
- Two chips.
- 1,000 pesos, sir.

34
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,558
Cut... The player's allowed to cut
at any time.

35
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,996
Of course.

36
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,909
1,000 pesos.

37
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,400
Cut.

38
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,192
Cut.

39
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,079
<i>As usual, I made my own luck, and I</i>
<i>knew when to stop letting it ride.</i>

40
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,509
The director wants to see you.

41
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,514
Is Brooklyn
across the river here, too?

42
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,996
<i>Let's go.</i>

43
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,352
- Hey.
- Thanks, peasant.

44
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,076
- Where is he?
- Don't worry. He'll be here.

45
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:16,319
- How about 1,000 pesos a piece?
- You can't buy your way out of it.

46
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,631
Wait a minute.

47
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,355
All right, Casey, Huerta.

48
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,353
- The man with the sharp friend.
- I said not to bring your own dice.

49
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,036
You really had me fooled last night.

50
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,876
I thought you were <i>someone,</i> not just
the manager of a gambling joint.

51
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,431
- My name is Ballin Mundson.
- Johnny Farrel.

52
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,276
And I'm not the manager,
I own the "joint".

53
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,194
- And I don't like to be cheated.
- There isn't a dice table...

54
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,876
Nobody wins that much at 21
honestly. You cut the cards well.

55
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,272
It took me years to learn.

56
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,675
You ought to be in jail, but I'm
obligated, since I saved your life.

57
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,392
- You should be more careful.
- Get out of here. Don't come back.

58
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,470
You're being very stupid.

59
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,634
- Probably.
- It's better I gamble on your side.

60
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,555
- I don't like my people cheating.
- I cheat with my own money, sure.

61
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,430
But with your money, I wouldn't
have to cheat. Think it over.

62
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,549
I think I will.
How much time do you give me?

63
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,432
No hurry, take a minute or two.
Excuse me while you decide.

64
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,914
Not you.

65
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,312
You shouldn't hit a man
who has his hands behind his back.

66
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,073
You can have two friends. I can be
very faithful... for a nice salary.

67
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,831
I must be sure
there's no woman anywhere.

68
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,596
- Gambling and women don't mix.
- The very words I use myself.

69
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,036
- Shall we quit talking about it?
- There was one?

70
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,478
Get this, I was born last night,
when we met in the alley.

71
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,519
No past and all future.
I like it that way.

72
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:01,358
<i>He let me ease myself to the top.</i>
<i>At first, I just watched the play.</i>

73
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,069
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>about that time, the war ended.</i>

74
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,996
Great news. I thought
we ought to celebrate, too.

75
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,993
Yes, of course.

76
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,038
Well...

77
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,634
I have to take a trip. I may be gone
for a while. You're in charge.

78
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,475
- You've been promoted.
- Do I get a raise?

79
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,509
No. Fair enough?
But you do get 5% of the profits.

80
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,797
- I'll take 7.
- You're sharp.

81
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,397
Almost as sharp as my other friend.
But not quite so obedient.

82
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,839
- My other friend would kill for me.
- That's what friends are for.

83
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,468
To us, Johnny.

84
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,791
To the three of us.

85
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,192
<i>It makes me laugh now, me being</i>
<i>so sure it was the three of us.</i>

86
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:03,630
<i>I soon found out. I remember I was</i>
<i>preparing for the Saturday crowd.</i>

87
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,873
<i>Funny I'd remember</i>
<i>what day it was, isn't it?</i>

88
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,991
- Isn't it enough?
- For a peasant?

89
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:19,235
Mr. Farrel, Mr. Mundson is back.
He'd like you to come to his house.

90
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,279
After all, I run the place.
He calls me Mr. Farrel.

91
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,352
Isn't that better?

92
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,068
<i>You'd think a bell would've rung,</i>
<i>some instinct of warning.</i>

93
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,950
<i>But I didn't.</i>
<i>I just walked right into it.</i>

94
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,999
Ballin?

95
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,475
- Ballin?
- He'll be down in a moment.

96
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,998
- Isn't it great having him back?
- I hope it will be the same.

97
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,475
Johnny, is that you?

98
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,152
- Hello, Ballin.
- Come up here.

99
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:32,119
What are you crying about?
You look foolish.

100
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:39,436
- Where's the canary?
- How did you know? Come...

101
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,750
This is where the canary is.

102
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,909
Quite a surprise to hear
a woman sing in my house, eh?

103
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,592
It's quite... a surprise.

104
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,390
- Gilda, are you decent?
- Me?

105
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,475
Sure, I'm decent.

106
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,833
Gilda, this is Johnny Farrel.
Johnny, this is Gilda.

107
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,910
I've heard a lot about you,
Johnny Farrel.

108
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,675
Really?
I haven't heard a word about you.

109
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,958
- Why, Ballin!
- I wanted to keep it as a surprise.

110
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,831
- You should have seen his face.
- Did you tell him why I'm here?

111
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,759
No, I wanted to save that as
a surprise too. Gilda is my wife.

112
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,993
Mrs. Ballin Mundson.
Is that all right?

113
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,672
- Congratulations.
- You congratulate the <i>husband.</i>

114
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,436
- What do you say to the bride?
- You wish her good luck.

115
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,678
- Good luck.
- Ballin says you believe in luck.

116
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,631
- We make our own luck.
- I'll have to try that, right now.

117
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,554
- Have him come to dinner tonight.
- It's an order.

118
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,670
We'll let you get dressed. It'll be
the casino's first glimpse of you.

119
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,392
I'll look my very best. I want
all the hired help to approve of me.

120
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,319
Goodbye, Mr. Farrel.

121
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:59,319
Johnny is such a hard name
to remember, and so easy to forget.

122
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,157
Johnny... there.
See you later, Mr. Farrel.

123
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,074
That's right, Mrs. Mundson.

124
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,199
- I'll see Johnny downstairs.
- I'll see him at the casino.

125
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,073
For some reason
she doesn't like you.

126
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,153
- What makes you think that?
- I know my wife.

127
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,950
- Why would she form such a feeling?
- Maybe it's chemical.

128
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,351
She'll get over it.

129
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,753
- When did you meet her?
- The day I left for the interior.

130
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,435
- When did you get married?
- The day after.

131
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,752
- When I want something...
- You buy it quick.

132
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,708
- Do you know anything about her?
- It's an odd coincidence.

133
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,714
She said she was born
the night we met.

134
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,989
All three of us with no pasts, just
futures. Isn't that interesting?

135
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,711
- What's the matter with you?
- "Women and gambling don't mix."

136
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,190
My wife isn't just a "woman".

137
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,876
- I could've made a mistake.
- You did. Don't make it again.

138
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,632
It starts already.

139
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,238
- What's this?
- Tact.

140
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,794
- Ballin, will you help me?
- See you at the casino.

141
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,880
<i>It was all I could do to walk away.</i>
<i>I wanted to hit her, -</i>

142
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,429
<i>- and him, too.</i>

143
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,197
<i>I wanted to go back and watch them</i>
<i>secretly. I wanted to know.</i>

144
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,514
I can never get a zipper to close.
Does that stand for something?

145
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,150
- You were rude to him.
- To whom?

146
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,596
- Johnny.
- Was I?

147
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,470
You'll have to teach me
good manners.

148
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,236
- I want you to like him.
- Are you sure about that?

149
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,916
He's an attractive man,
if you like the type.

150
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,278
- He's a boy.
- Boys can grow up quickly.

151
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,477
- Almost when you're not looking.
- But <i>I'll</i> be looking.

152
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,395
- Your shoes.
- It's about time.

153
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,030
- Shall I put them on your feet?
- For how much?

154
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,309
The charge is slight, as I always
find this a revealing vantage point.

155
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,678
A worm's-eye view
is so often the true one.

156
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,994
- You're quite a philosopher.
- One hears rumours.

157
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,757
To my department
comes all the gossip.

158
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,391
One hears she is very beautiful.

159
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,829
And young, and American.
You are also young and American.

160
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,711
- It will be interesting to watch.
- Maybe you should be fired.

161
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,799
Johnny, Mr. Mundson says to tell you
that they're here.

162
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,112
- Have you seen her?
- Cut that!

163
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,553
- What did I do?
- You whistled. I heard you.

164
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,078
After all, she is Mrs. Mundson.
So mind your manners.

165
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,831
Yes,
it will be interesting to watch.

166
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,279
- Number two.
- No more bets.

167
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,510
Number two, black.

168
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,472
Number two, black.
Place your bets.

169
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:03,033
- Take over.
- Going into business for yourself?

170
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,398
- Orders, Mr. Farrel.
- Not my orders...

171
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,111
- Johnny, I've been looking for you.
- Gambling is illegal in Argentina.

172
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,435
Is that the reason for the pay-off?

173
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,549
- Naturally.
- Why doesn't it show on the books?

174
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,111
- You may ask any question you wish.
- I just asked one.

175
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,752
Let's have dinner. Gilda is much
too beautiful to be left alone.

176
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,230
- You've changed the subject.
- Yes.

177
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,076
I found him.
Very elusive chap.

178
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,952
- You're looking very beautiful.
- Can't you return the compliment?

179
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,953
You're looking very beautiful.

180
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,033
If there's anything I love,
it's a spontaneous compliment.

181
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,194
You're so nice that I'll show you
my husband's coming-home present.

182
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,593
- Isn't it cute?
- 50,000 pesos, and it's cute.

183
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,676
Wait, let's drink to us.
To the three of us.

184
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,152
- What's the matter, Johnny?
- I get confused.

185
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,108
Just a few weeks ago
we drank to the three of us.

186
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,158
Well, should I be jealous?

187
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,232
- It was just a friend of mine.
- A him or a her?

188
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,915
That's an interesting question.
Johnny?

189
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,117
- A her.
- Why that conclusion?

190
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,793
Because it looks like one thing,
then it suddenly becomes another.

191
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,311
You haven't much faith
in the stability of women.

192
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,996
One wonders what woman
brought Johnny to this pretty pass.

193
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:13,190
One does.
Let's hate her, shall we, Ballin?

194
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:19,276
- Let's. Shall we, Johnny?
- Let's. <i>That</i> I'll drink to.

195
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,117
Pardon me.

196
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,592
- Anything I can do?
- No, I'll be right back.

197
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,911
Isn't this something.
It's a small world in Argentina.

198
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,154
- Why did you marry him?
- He's an attractive man.

199
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,677
- You don't love him.
- What was that word again?

200
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,836
You married him for his money.
That's a great way to make a living.

201
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,599
- The pot calling the kettle black?
- I was down and out. He saved me.

202
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:22,235
What a coincidence! That's the
story of my life... Hello.

203
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,030
I am Captain Delgado. I would like
permission to dance with your lady.

204
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,239
- The answer is no.
- The answer is yes. I'd love it.

205
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,996
- But the young man...
- He'd love to, but can't afford it.

206
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,429
Women can be extremely annoying.
Maurice Obregon, at your service.

207
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,435
So that's your name.
I've been watching you for weeks.

208
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,434
You don't gamble or drink.
Why do hang around here?

209
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:02,755
The atmosphere has always
interested me. Now it fascinates me.

210
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,240
- You can be a professional dancer.
- I am. I mean, I was.

211
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:29,475
- That's against our union rules.
- I always observe the rules.

212
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,398
- How is it that I haven't seen you?
- I danced in America.

213
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,269
- This is not America?
- I mean New York.

214
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,513
- Is your young man also...?
- He's not my young man.

215
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,037
The expression on his face
says he wishes he were.

216
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,317
- Remember the rules.
- The rules are changeable.

217
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,549
Everything all right?
Who are the two krauts?

218
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,518
- Messenger boys.
- Whose?

219
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,800
- I thought you may be in trouble.
- I am. My wife seems to be missing.

220
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,997
- She's dancing.
- You shouldn't have allowed it.

221
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,154
What could I do?
She's not my... She's your wife.

222
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,756
- Go get her.
- Wait a minute...

223
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:17,359
A husband looks ridiculous dragging
his wife from another man's arms.

224
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,154
I'll get her.

225
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,030
- Your husband is showing.
- Thank you. Perhaps again.

226
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,718
- Until then, I shall be miserable.
- There's something about Latin men.

227
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,917
For one thing, they can dance.
For another thing...

228
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,712
What's your number? Never mind,
I'll give you mine. Cuyo 3017.

229
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:01,274
- What did you say to him?
- If a man answers, hang up.

230
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,752
You can't talk to men here
the way you would at home.

231
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,912
- They think you mean it.
- Mean what?

232
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,834
Doesn't it bother you
that you're married?

233
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,390
Does it bother you?

234
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,628
I may have misjudged your Johnny.
He can be sweet. So protective.

235
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,316
He takes care of everything
that belongs to me.

236
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,076
You're to take care of me
because I belong to the boss.

237
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,951
- I do all kinds of odd jobs.
- I bet this is the oddest.

238
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,309
I believe we were about to
drink a toast.

239
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,553
Disaster to the wench
who did wrong by our Johnny.

240
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:57,068
- You won't drink to that?
- Why not? Disaster to the wench.

241
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,916
<i>She managed to say it,</i>
<i>but I knew it would haunt her.</i>

242
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,473
<i>Anyone as superstitious as Gilda,</i>
<i>out loud, asking for disaster.</i>

243
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:23,920
- Hi.
- You're still dressed.

244
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,037
- Hi.
- You're still dressed.

245
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,432
- Anything wrong?
- I told you, zippers throw me.

246
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,116
- You'll have a maid in the morning.
- Will she be old and ugly?

247
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:49,709
It's smart to surround yourself
with ugly women and beautiful men.

248
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,351
- You knew him before.
- Who?

249
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,071
- Johnny.
- Johnny Farrel?

250
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,312
- You knew him before.
- No.

251
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,519
- Don't ever lie to me.
- I'm telling the truth.

252
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,878
I don't think I ever knew him.

253
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,159
I see. You're a child, Gilda.
A beautiful, greedy child.

254
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,871
I like to feed you beautiful things.
You have such a good appetite.

255
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,560
- But I shouldn't make any mistakes?
- No, you shouldn't.

256
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,033
If you're worried about
Johnny Farrel, don't be. I hate him.

257
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,636
And he hates you. That's apparent.

258
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,430
But hate can be an exciting emotion.

259
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:50,596
Haven't you noticed that?
There is a heat in it one can feel.

260
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,675
Didn't you feel it tonight?
I did.

261
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,188
It warmed me. Hate is the
only thing that has ever warmed me.

262
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,476
Place your bets,
ladies and gentlemen.

263
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,753
No more bets.

264
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:18,391
- 13 black.
- That's me!

265
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,756
This has been going on for years,
and I didn't know about it?

266
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,912
- One is not always lucky.
- I am.

267
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,870
- Careful, there's an old saying...
- "Lucky at cards, unlucky at love."

268
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,238
It's a good thing
I'm not superstitious.

269
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,316
Keep it for me.

270
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,196
Place your bets,
ladies and gentlemen.

271
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,158
- Number two.
- No more bets.

272
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,912
Place your bets.

273
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,071
- Got a light?
- Yes, Mrs. Mundson.

274
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,030
- It is so crowded, yet so lonely.
- How did you know?

275
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,194
You smoke too much. Only
frustrated people smoke too much, -

276
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,272
- and only the lonely
are frustrated.

277
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,115
- Well, aren't you cute!
- Cute? Me?

278
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,353
Awfully cute.
I think I'm going to like you.

279
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:23,829
I'm sorry. I was just
tossing away my frustration.

280
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,073
- And it landed right on me.
- And that means something?

281
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,789
- It means we'll have a drink.
- No...

282
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,475
On the other hand, I'd love to.

283
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:45,510
- Now we'll see.
- See what?

284
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,719
Whether you are a gentleman,
or a peasant.

285
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,193
The beautiful one is at the bar.
She will probably have trouble.

286
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:01,276
- Really? What kind of trouble?
- A very good-looking man.

287
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,117
Your source of income is in his
office. He will likely have trouble.

288
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,274
- What kind of trouble?
- Also a man. Not so good-looking.

289
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,356
Now we know.
You are what I said.

290
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:28,357
Your business losses were reimbursed
at the casino table, generously.

291
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,035
Yet you continue
to sell tungsten wire to Bendolin.

292
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,716
But Mr. Bendolin can't manufacture
electric light globes without it.

293
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,590
- He can't continue in business...
- We don't wish him to continue.

294
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,992
But he's the only outlet
for my product.

295
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,756
If I don't sell to him, <i>I</i> can't
continue. Do you understand?

296
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:56,040
- Perfectly.
- It doesn't matter to you, does it?

297
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:03,550
I sympathise with you, deeply. Life
is difficult for defenceless people.

298
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:10,592
Yes, as you say.
Thank you, Mr. Mundson.

299
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,310
We're in the gambling business.
What game uses light globes?

300
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,631
Let's join Gilda for a drink.

301
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:34,319
Better let me case the joint first,
see if the coast is clear.

302
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:41,431
I didn't like the look
on the defenceless one's face.

303
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,593
All right.
Gilda was right, you <i>are</i> protective.

304
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,117
Sure, that's me all over.
Give me five minutes.

305
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,151
- Didn't you notice I'm dancing?
- You <i>were.</i>

306
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,598
- What's the idea?
- I've never finished a dance here.

307
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,514
When Ballin comes down,
I want you to be alone.

308
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,753
- Is it <i>Ballin</i> who would object?
- Who is this guy?

309
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,029
Johnny Farrel, he runs the joint.
This is Gabe Evans. Isn't he cute?

310
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,716
- Just darling. Get him out of here.
- But I like him.

311
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,193
- If he leaves, I go with him.
- That's all right with me.

312
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:44,037
- What's keeping you?
- Let's go where we can have fun.

313
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,954
- Like I said?
- Exactly. Didn't you hear about me?

314
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,432
If I'd been a ranch, they would've
named me "The Bar Nothing".

315
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,633
- The coast is clear?
- Very clear.

316
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,512
I'm a big boy.
You can tell me things.

317
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,357
Gilda warned me that you'd grow up.
By the way, where is she?

318
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,559
She was bored.
She went to see an American picture.

319
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,315
- Alone?
- She doesn't know anybody here.

320
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,359
You'd know more about that
than I would.

321
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,792
<i>He's dead.</i>

322
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,714
It's bad form
to make a scene in public.

323
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,759
Only fools ruin themselves gambling.

324
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,279
- Come on home.
- What happened to him?

325
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,756
- Did he kill himself?
- Yes.

326
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,798
If a man is weak enough to accept
a bribe, he is already a dying man.

327
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,670
- It didn't bother you?
- That he killed himself? No.

328
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,719
- It bothered me you were afraid.
- I was amazed.

329
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,671
I realised something could happen to
me, so I want to tell you something.

330
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,437
Over here, Johnny.

331
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,710
Remember this.

332
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,555
Remember this, too.

333
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,037
- Could you do it now by yourself?
- Yes.

334
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,832
8 left, 24 right, 2 left, 17 right.

335
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,592
You're the only one who knows.
If anything should happen to me, -

336
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,594
- there are signatures
and instructions on how to carry on.

337
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:25,711
Thanks for not letting me down.
You don't just own a gambling joint?

338
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:33,070
- You know what a cartel is?
- A monopoly of some kind, isn't it?

339
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,949
- An international monopoly.
- In what?

340
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,954
Tungsten. That doesn't impress you.

341
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:46,433
Is it worth getting shot at
for the pleasure of monopolising it?

342
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,800
A man who controls a strategic
material can control the world.

343
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,832
- The world's a pretty big place.
- Made up of stupid little people.

344
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,315
- If it can be done, I'd bet on you.
- And you'd win. Let's have a drink.

345
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,951
With you and Gilda on my side...
You are on my side?

346
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,759
- I told you that.
- And Gilda?

347
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,276
- What do you mean?
- Women are funny creatures.

348
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,390
- I don't know much about them.
- Odd things are important to them.

349
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:30,635
- I bought her, as I bought you.
- She knows that, doesn't she?

350
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,918
That's just it.
Money doesn't mean much to Gilda.

351
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:40,632
If she should become restless...
I'm mad about her, Johnny.

352
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,672
Mad...

353
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:54,756
- What do you think of that?
- It's great. She's on your side.

354
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,833
I'd lay 8-5 on that, and I'd win.

355
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,755
I'd better get back.

356
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,319
I have the funniest feeling
we're not alone.

357
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,917
Maybe we're haunted. Maybe
if we go inside, it will go away.

358
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,755
Besides being pretty,
you're positively intelligent.

359
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,914
No.

360
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,039
I have the funniest feeling
somebody said something.

361
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,432
Maybe the lady forgot to tell you
her husband lives here.

362
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,957
For a long time,
I've taken husbands in small doses.

363
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:25,514
- I've developed immunity to them.
- You're through for tonight. Scram.

364
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:33,353
- So he runs this joint, too?
- I said, scram.

365
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,877
- Hitting a man when he's drunk...
- He shouldn't get drunk on my time.

366
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,238
I take care of everything
that belongs to the boss.

367
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,394
- What's his is yours?
- You went to a picture show. Alone.

368
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:04,429
Really... Would you like to know
whether I enjoyed it?

369
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:10,038
- That's what I told Ballin.
- Making me deceive my husband...

370
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:15,320
I got news for you. He didn't
just buy something, he loves you.

371
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,439
Is that so hard to understand?
I've got news for you.

372
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,309
I'm going to do what I please,
when I please.

373
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,871
I was true to one man once,
and look what happened.

374
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:35,276
- This is about him, not us.
- Really? You don't say so.

375
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,753
Whatever you do, I'm going to
make sure it looks all right to him.

376
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:47,632
Go anywhere, with anyone, but I'll
take you there and bring you home.

377
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,954
Exactly the way I take
and pick up his laundry.

378
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,873
Shame on you.

379
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,953
Any psychiatrist would say your
thought associations are revealing.

380
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,113
- What are you saying?
- They'd say it means something.

381
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:09,308
- Did you hear what I said?
- You'll take me and pick me up.

382
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,597
All to protect Ballin.

383
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,434
Who do you think you're kidding?

384
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:32,433
<i>I hated her so,</i>
<i>I couldn't get her out of my mind.</i>

385
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,115
<i>She was in the air I breathed.</i>

386
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:54,558
<i>I thought I was dreaming. I'd heard</i>
<i>her voice in my sleep anyway.</i>

387
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,837
<i>Then I realised...</i>

388
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,639
Good morning. How pretty
you look in your night-gown.

389
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:59,796
- What are you doing here?
- Singing to my friend.

390
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,750
- How long have you been here?
- How long?

391
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,550
Five verses.
I was just listening.

392
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,998
- Did you hear that the poor cow...
- Get out of here.

393
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:20,554
- Get back to your washroom.
- Put a beggar on horseback, huh?

394
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,598
Well, here's the laundry,
waiting to be picked up.

395
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,833
- Where have you been?
- Swimming.

396
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,992
I bet you don't believe me.

397
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,199
Ballin won't either,
unless you're there to back me up.

398
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,909
You went swimming with me.
Didn't we have a good time?

399
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,994
Swimming...
Where's your bathing suit?

400
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:55,518
Under this.
Want to see?

401
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,673
- I'll get dressed.
- I hate to drag you out now.

402
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,628
But it's your idea.

403
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:09,397
Why not make it easy on yourself
and let him find out about me?

404
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:14,395
Are you afraid
of what he might do to me?

405
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,235
Johnny...

406
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,154
- I am.
- What?

407
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,199
- Afraid.
- You?

408
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:32,833
- I wish I'd never...
- Never what?

409
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,878
Getting married on the rebound
is stupid.

410
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,589
- Rebound from what?
- You.

411
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:52,028
Because you don't know a man
you've only known one day.

412
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:56,478
He doesn't know you, either.
That way you start even.

413
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,996
All fair and even.

414
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,032
Would it interest you to know
how much I hate you, Johnny?

415
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:17,117
I hate you so much that I'd destroy
myself to take you down with me.

416
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,434
Now I've warned you.
Now that's all fair and even.

417
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,195
All fair and even.

418
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,230
I know why you're here
at five in the morning.

419
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,279
I'm the laundry.
I'm simply obeying instructions.

420
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,835
Now who's kidding who?

421
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:31,355
Now you've delivered me, don't you
want to get a receipt from the man?

422
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,552
- Ballin... you're up.
- Yes.

423
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,633
- Late to bed, early to rise...
- Let Gilda talk, Johnny.

424
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,588
I thought I could sneak out
and get back without waking you.

425
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,469
We went swimming. You were asleep.

426
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,475
Suddenly I had to go swimming.
It was so hot.

427
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,189
- You weren't worried, were you?
- Yes.

428
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:03,353
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Is that why you're so nervous?

429
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,318
Nervous? No...

430
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,751
A terrible thing happened to me.
No wonder I'm nervous.

431
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:17,869
- I lost the clip you gave me.
- Is that all?

432
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:23,672
- Isn't that enough?
- A clip can be replaced.

433
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:28,072
Thanks for being so nice about it.
I'm sorry.

434
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,438
A clip can be replaced.
You see, I thought I had lost you.

435
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,673
Me?
Not a chance.

436
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:42,153
- And that couldn't be replaced.
- Let's have a drink, before I cry.

437
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:46,677
Johnny doesn't think it would be
a tragedy if you lost me.

438
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:53,791
There are more women in the world
than anything else, except insects.

439
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:59,956
On that charming observation,
I shall go and change for breakfast.

440
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:07,993
Johnny is a terrific swimmer.
He out-distanced me beautifully.

441
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:13,871
But some day there will be a return
match, and then, look out, Johnny.

442
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:27,114
Johnny, you'll have to teach me how.

443
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,558
- How to what?
- Swim, what else?

444
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:37,113
- Sure. Any time.
- Apparently you're very good at it.

445
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,717
- Pretty good.
- Did you teach Gilda how to swim?

446
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:49,956
I taught her everything she knows.
Does that satisfy you?

447
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,908
Let's take that trombone part
over again and make it cleaner.

448
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,678
Julio, Julio!

449
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,552
You can't tell me where to put it!

450
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,037
These are things some merry-makers
add to their costumes.

451
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:50,671
- Care to make a choice?
- You have a great sense of humour.

452
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:58,311
- Which would you suggest?
- Whatever you wear...

453
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:04,874
You will start out as this,
and end up as this.

454
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:10,876
- How did you figure that out?
- It is the beautiful one's party.

455
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:17,912
She has changed the decorations, the
orchestra. Maybe she'll change...

456
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:23,670
I warned you once. You didn't
listen. Now you're through.

457
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:29,278
- Through with what?
- The casino. You're fired.

458
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:37,832
You are mistaken. I will be here
after you are gone, Mr. Peasant.

459
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,873
You once asked what a philosopher
like me was doing in the washroom.

460
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:53,754
Now I'll tell you. To my department
comes all the gossip...

461
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,155
He's not here. No one is here.

462
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,878
Maybe the "private" sign should have
been printed in German, too.

463
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,591
Or maybe you can't speak Spanish.
But I assure you, it says "private".

464
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,990
We intend to see Mr. Mundson.
He's been avoiding us.

465
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,675
Mr. Mundson is allergic
to messenger boys.

466
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:27,516
The American Indian walks into
something that doesn't concern him.

467
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:32,993
- That's an old American custom.
- You're not invited to the party.

468
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:37,756
- Tell the old man to go away.
- No, you go away.

469
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,152
- We intend to see Mr. Mundson.
- You said that before...

470
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,878
Get him on the telephone.

471
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,349
Why didn't you say what you wanted?

472
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,158
Mr. Mundson. This is Mr. Farrel.

473
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:07,796
Some add these to their costumes.
I have two lovely heads of pigs...

474
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:12,909
No sale, Uncle Pio.
They'll just use their own faces.

475
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:19,076
Ballin? There are two nice kids here
with German accents.

476
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:25,918
They want an appointment with you.
One of them has a gun in my back.

477
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:32,315
Tell them to come here, in an hour.

478
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:38,271
And Johnny, you come now.
Immediately.

479
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:04,473
- Listen, Maria. Carnival.
- Yes, little one. Carnival.

480
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:10,317
- What does it mean, exactly?
- The last three days before Lent.

481
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:15,315
In Roman Catholic countries,
it's feasting and merry-making.

482
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,995
Then comes the fasting
and the penance.

483
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:24,792
- Make hay while the sun shines.
- You have a strange language.

484
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:33,111
I mean, three days
of sowing wild oats...

485
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,034
...and then comes the harvest.

486
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:48,675
Maria, I have the funniest feeling.

487
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:56,995
Don't tell anybody,
but I'm awfully superstitious.

488
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,709
Don't tell anybody.

489
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:06,750
I have the funniest feeling
that this is it.

490
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,310
- It?
- I mean...

491
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,359
That for me, too, it's carnival.

492
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,470
<i>Gilda?</i>

493
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,916
- Yes, Ballin?
<i>- May I come in?</i>

494
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:31,359
I'm going to be delayed.
Johnny will take you to the party.

495
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,114
What's the matter?

496
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:40,310
You're very excited about something.
Perhaps it's in the air.

497
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,996
Perhaps you shouldn't have opened
the window. Close it.

498
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:03,196
See how quiet it is now?

499
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,716
See how easily
one can shut away excitement?

500
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:12,000
Just by closing a window.
Remember that, Gilda.

501
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:17,757
I want to see your costume before
you go. I see you'll carry a whip.

502
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,152
Have you warned Johnny,
so he can also arm himself?

503
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,436
Nobody could ever dance like you.

504
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:55,352
When a person dances with you,
it's like they're a part of you.

505
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:00,719
You always did talk your head off
all the time you were dancing.

506
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,558
You used to say,
"One thing at a time."

507
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:12,398
"Talk or dance, but don't
do both things at the same time."

508
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,160
- You used to say...
- I still say it.

509
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,798
- You used to say...
- I still say it.

510
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:25,518
I have to keep talking, as long
as I have my arms around you.

511
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,470
- I might forget to dance.
- What are you trying to do?

512
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:36,189
I'm not even trying very hard,
but I'm doing it.

513
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:40,353
Doing what?

514
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,993
- Push my hat back, Johnny.
- It's all right.

515
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,119
Push it back.

516
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:04,236
You're out of practise, aren't you?
Dancing, I mean.

517
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:11,950
I could help you get
in practise again. Dancing, I mean.

518
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,837
Good evening.

519
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,993
Obregon.
I'm in again, as you put it.

520
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,517
- We're all here.
- Yes, we are.

521
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:45,754
I suggest sending Mrs. Mundson home.
There's going to be trouble.

522
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:50,152
I suggest you get her out
before the unmasking at twelve.

523
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:53,756
You sound like a bad melodrama.

524
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:00,751
- What are you doing?
- Here's the comic relief.

525
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:04,435
- Now the drama's complete.
- What do you want?

526
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:09,469
I got a letter for you. She was
sorry she didn't get to say goodbye.

527
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:20,352
- No bad news, I hope?
- Johnny, she left with...

528
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:25,548
- What's that to you?
- You sure act sore about it.

529
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:30,919
- You'd think she was your...
- Check everyone that comes in.

530
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:34,834
She didn't come in, she went out.

531
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:40,115
Lose something, Mr. Farrel?

532
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:53,669
- I didn't even know you'd arrived.
- But obviously I did.

533
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:58,516
- Where's Gilda?
- I can't keep track, in this mob.

534
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:02,116
Find her for me.

535
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,829
Sure. I won't guarantee
how long it'll take.

536
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,551
I'll wait.
I'm a great one for waiting.

537
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:02,315
Take your mask off,
it's time to unmask.

538
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:48,718
- Going home would be a good idea.
- Why, because a man drank too much?

539
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,670
That messenger boy didn't drink
too much, he was murdered.

540
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,798
Good. It saves us the trouble.

541
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,078
- Did your keep your appointment?
- No, I missed them.

542
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,152
- Did you find Gilda?
- No.

543
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:08,029
- Find her, take her home.
- I'll stick with you.

544
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:14,958
No. In <i>chemin de fer,</i> you play for
the full stake or you pass the shoe.

545
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:18,829
You can't rule the world
by passing the shoe.

546
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,597
Do as I say. Take her home. I expect
my little friends to be obedient.

547
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,150
- Speaking of little friends...
- Don't.

548
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:34,190
Wait for me at home. I may need
both of my little friends tonight.

549
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:37,352
Okay, Ballin.

550
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:54,392
This is Mundson. Call the airfield,
tell them to proceed as instructed.

551
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,109
Is that clear?
Proceed as instructed.

552
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:04,148
- Ballin was wrong, wasn't he?
- About what?

553
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:09,997
He said you could shut out
excitement by just closing a door.

554
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,312
You can't, can you?

555
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,757
I don't know
what you're talking about.

556
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:32,359
I was just mentioning
how quiet it was in the house.

557
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:39,790
There isn't anybody here but us.
Everybody's celebrating Carnival.

558
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,589
What about it?

559
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,196
I was just mentioning it.

560
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,475
Goodnight, Johnny.

561
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:14,630
<i>I couldn't get out of my head</i>
<i>what she said about us being alone.</i>

562
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:24,599
<i>Ballin was in the casino, fighting</i>
<i>for his life. And this little...</i>

563
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:34,119
<i>I knew all his dreams of greatness</i>
<i>would be wrecked because of her.</i>

564
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:40,469
<i>He wasn't strong enough to throw</i>
<i>her out. I had to do it for him.</i>

565
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,269
Gilda!

566
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,279
Get your clothes on,
you're getting out of here.

567
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:10,194
Are we, Johnny? Are we?

568
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,633
Not we. You!

569
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:25,548
- You do hate me, don't you?
- You have no idea how much.

570
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,998
Hate is a very exciting emotion.

571
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:37,870
Haven't you noticed?
Very exciting...

572
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:46,512
I hate you too, Johnny.

573
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:52,596
I hate you so much,
I think I'm going to die from it.

574
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:57,271
Darling...

575
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:05,670
I think I'm going to die from it.

576
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,272
You left it open when you came in.

577
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,433
Ballin!

578
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,750
Africa's more than 2,000 miles away.

579
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:42,074
- I don't think he'll make it.
- I don't think he intends to try.

580
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:39,078
- You managed it.
- Naturally. The sea plane is ready?

581
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:43,233
- You ran into trouble?
- An unfortunate murder.

582
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:48,235
Obregon knows I did it. I'll stay
away as long as necessary, -

583
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,393
- then I'll go back,
and attend to something.

584
01:16:54,040 --> 01:17:01,071
<i>In his will, Ballin left everything</i>
<i>to Gilda, with me as sole executor.</i>

585
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:08,837
<i>I had the papers that Ballin said</i>
<i>would let a man rule the world.</i>

586
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,197
<i>It didn't seem like much.</i>

587
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:16,797
<i>The tungsten mine, a few patents,</i>
<i>a dozen small corporations -</i>

588
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,999
<i>- that formed one organisation</i>
<i>with Mundson at the head.</i>

589
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:29,158
<i>But then I saw the power. How it</i>
<i>could gobble up the opposition.</i>

590
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:34,269
You've come a long way to learn what
will happen to your association.

591
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:39,434
I've told you. Now you can return
knowing that nothing has changed.

592
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,388
I'll carry on
where Mr. Mundson left off.

593
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:52,518
- Anything else, gentlemen?
- No one man should be in charge...

594
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:57,071
I'm the sole executor.
It's going to be business as usual.

595
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:03,110
- Mrs. Mundson is the sole legatee.
- And in no condition to see anyone.

596
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:07,592
Her husband's death hit her hard.
She asked me to represent her.

597
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:12,276
We need be in no hurry to leave.
She may recover.

598
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:18,515
Not a chance in the world.
She's marrying me this afternoon.

599
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,510
It stopped raining.
Maybe that means something.

600
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:56,674
You haven't got over
being superstitious. Come on.

601
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:01,994
- Not back to the house?
- Do you think I'm that kind of guy?

602
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:07,792
No one knows what kind of guy
you are but me. Not even you.

603
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,871
All my clothes are here.

604
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:47,239
Even my perfume.
You think of everything.

605
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:54,078
We're right back where we started.
Right back where...

606
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:01,190
Right back where we started.

607
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:06,792
Johnny, that isn't even decent.

608
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,794
What was that word again?

609
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:16,114
Decent...
I said, "decent".

610
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:21,912
That's what I thought you said.
It sounded funny coming out of you.

611
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:32,270
<i>She didn't know then that the door</i>
<i>was closing on her own cage.</i>

612
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:38,595
<i>She wasn't faithful before, but</i>
<i>she would be, now that he was dead.</i>

613
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:45,989
Why are you coming to work tonight?
I believe in my duty to my job...

614
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:49,789
Good, because you've got a new one.

615
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:55,751
From now on, you stick with
Mrs. Mundson... Mrs. Farrel.

616
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:00,835
You're always with her. She talks
to no one, and no one talks to her.

617
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,037
- You get that?
- Is she in danger?

618
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:09,035
You will be, if you don't do
exactly as I've told you.

619
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:25,116
- You were quiet this afternoon.
- What I have to say, I say to you.

620
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,352
- Not the others.
- I'm flattered.

621
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:33,310
Would you like to know how Mundson
came to be the head of the cartel?

622
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:36,916
- You saw the patents were German.
- They were.

623
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:43,030
- They belong to my principals.
- Not anymore.

624
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:49,469
Three years ago, when Argentina was
poised to declare war against us, -

625
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:54,077
- we allowed Mundson to buy
our patents.

626
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:59,155
- Good idea. The casino as a front.
- We even advanced him the money.

627
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:03,154
You couldn't have picked
a nicer man.

628
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:12,229
We had an agreement. He was to
return our property after the war.

629
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,915
- I didn't find any agreement.
- It was a gentleman's agreement.

630
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:20,312
- And he wasn't a gentleman?
- He was a madman.

631
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,836
He thought
he could rule the world.

632
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,117
I know.
We had quite a discussion about it.

633
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:32,594
<i>She still didn't believe</i>
<i>I wasn't coming back.</i>

634
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:40,117
<i>Every night she got dressed up</i>
<i>and waited.</i>

635
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:45,916
<i>But Gilda couldn't stand</i>
<i>not knowing the why of things, -</i>

636
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:52,838
<i>- so she swallowed her pride and</i>
<i>came to see me. That was wonderful.</i>

637
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,114
Yes?

638
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:12,677
Hello. Remember me?

639
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:18,153
I'm Gilda, your wife.
Remember?

640
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:30,672
You haven't been around lately.
I thought maybe you had amnesia.

641
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,838
Got a light?

642
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:55,556
You don't look so hot.

643
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:59,235
You're losing weight.

644
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:07,557
This vacuum I'm living in...
Mind giving me a reason?

645
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:11,076
You've had such a full life
up till now, -

646
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:16,109
- I thought some quiet
would give you time to think.

647
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:20,717
- Think about what?
- Is it too corny to say, your sins?

648
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,668
- Yes, it is.
- Well, I said it.

649
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,074
You're cock-eyed, Johnny.

650
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:36,190
I figured that was the deal. You're
getting even with me for something.

651
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:41,912
We're great people for getting even.
Aren't we?

652
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:45,993
I got even with you
by marrying Ballin.

653
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:52,076
- That's great. The man's dead...
- And I'm glad! He was insane.

654
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:57,519
- I was afraid all the time.
- You acted like it.

655
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:02,515
There's never been anybody
but you and me.

656
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:08,357
All those things I did
were just to make you jealous.

657
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,308
- There's never been anybody else.
- Not anybody?

658
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,678
Not anybody.

659
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:24,278
If you could forget your husband
so easily, you could forget others.

660
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:30,390
- But there weren't any others.
- Admit them. Tell me who they were.

661
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:39,678
Who'd think one woman could marry
two insane men in one lifetime?

662
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:55,315
<i>She wasn't scared, yet,</i>
<i>because she didn't realise yet.</i>

663
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:59,439
<i>Right now she was just mad,</i>
<i>and she was hitting back.</i>

664
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:06,199
Try and locate a Mr. Gabe Evans.
Try all the hotels in the city.

665
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:12,390
<i>She couldn't find him,</i>
<i>so she reached out for anyone.</i>

666
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,791
<i>They weren't hard to find.</i>

667
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,953
<i>The waiter told him he had a call.</i>

668
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:24,671
<i>One of my men grabbed him outside.</i>
<i>He never came back.</i>

669
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:31,035
<i>She found somebody else, of course.</i>

670
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:37,517
<i>But wherever she went...</i>

671
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:48,398
<i>She finally realised Buenos Aires</i>
<i>was her prison, so she ran away.</i>

672
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:52,553
<i>She got a job singing</i>
<i>in a club in Montevideo.</i>

673
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:56,872
<i>She started divorce proceedings,</i>
<i>and met a man.</i>

674
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:04,917
Let forever be tonight,
is that a date?

675
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,958
I haven't even got my divorce yet.

676
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:14,389
- I haven't any right to...
- I don't want you to divorce.

677
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:20,908
The divorce you get here
will never stand up in Argentina.

678
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:27,713
- But I'm never going back there.
- You may want to go home some time.

679
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:33,238
Wherever you go, you'll be
tied to him. You'll never be free.

680
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:38,508
Then it didn't do any good
to run away.

681
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:41,240
It never does.

682
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:48,192
Go back to Buenos Aires
and get an annulment.

683
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:52,638
He left you right after
the ceremony. There's nothing to it!

684
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:57,828
I'll be right by your side.
I'm a very good lawyer, you know.

685
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,994
I have more money than I can spend,
and I'm in love with you.

686
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:08,393
- Isn't that a terrific combination?
- Yes, it is.

687
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:15,398
The plane leaves at two o'clock.
At two the next day you'll be free!

688
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:24,917
I didn't think I'd ever trust
another man, but here I go again.

689
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:27,196
Thanks, Tom.

690
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:48,149
- Tom, this is the Hotel Centenario.
- I was told it's a good hotel.

691
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:51,949
I think it's wonderful.

692
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:03,076
- I'll do it.
- Your bags will be right up.

693
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:11,908
The light switch is here,
if my memory doesn't fail me.

694
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:23,950
Okay, Langford.

695
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:34,358
I'll do it anyway.
I'll get an annulment!

696
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:39,389
- There's no annulment in Argentina.
- I'll get it anyway!

697
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:44,190
I will!
I'll get an annulment! I will!

698
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:59,751
Johnny, please let me go.

699
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:05,790
I can't stand it anymore.
I don't want anything from you, -

700
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:09,555
- but please, just let me go.

701
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:13,793
- Getting you here was a nice touch.
- About that night...

702
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:18,988
I don't want to hear about
that night. Can't you understand?

703
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:39,152
- I was waiting for you, Mr. Farrel.
- Find anything interesting?

704
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:43,598
Close the joint up
if it bothers you so much.

705
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:47,355
Why do you think
we allow the casino to stay open?

706
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:53,629
You leave a purse-snatcher alone
if he'll lead you to a bigger crime.

707
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:59,557
We know you run the monopoly. We
want the names of the participants.

708
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:05,113
- I don't know what you're on about.
- I'll wait.

709
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:12,630
You're breaking up in little pieces.
Am I wearing you down?

710
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:16,588
- You?
- Something is.

711
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,799
I hadn't noticed...

712
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:36,031
More!

713
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:49,159
I'm not very good at zippers.
Maybe if I had some help...

714
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:52,278
- I'll help you.
- I'm an expert!

715
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:06,479
- I hate to do this, but Johnny...
- Leave me alone!

716
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:25,716
- What is this?
- Now they know what I am.

717
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:32,752
It's no use just <i>you</i> knowing it.
Now they know you got taken!

718
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:35,434
That he married a...

719
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:55,193
The German has been arrested.
He will talk.

720
01:37:55,360 --> 01:38:01,356
All we want from you are the patents
and the signed agreements.

721
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:05,672
We must know who the signers are -

722
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:09,515
- to prosecute them
for breaking the anti-trust laws.

723
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:23,150
You didn't hear a word of it.
All you can think of is Gilda.

724
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:29,520
- You love each other terribly.
- I hate her!

725
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:38,076
That's what I mean. It's the oddest
love/hate pattern I've ever seen.

726
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:45,316
As long as you're sick in the head
about her, you can't think clearly.

727
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:52,352
All right, you're under arrest
for operating a gambling casino.

728
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:55,956
I'll let you stay here
under protective custody.

729
01:38:56,120 --> 01:39:02,434
Send for me when you can't stand it
anymore. I want those signatures.

730
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:08,031
I can out-wait you.
I have the law on my side.

731
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:13,433
It's a very comfortable feeling.
You ought to try it some time.

732
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,869
8 left, 24 right, 2 left, 17 right.

733
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:29,952
- You got that?
- I got it.

734
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:35,752
There's everything in there
you want, and nothing that I want.

735
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:39,117
No. That's at the casino, waiting.

736
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:48,353
When you sent for me,
I sent for Gilda. She's going home.

737
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:55,232
- Home? Clear home?
- At least you could wish her luck.

738
01:39:55,400 --> 01:40:01,839
- She makes her own luck.
- How dumb can a man be?

739
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,551
Get out of here before you realise
what a heel you've been.

740
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:13,558
I can't bear to see you break down.
I'm a sensitive man, for a cop.

741
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:18,919
Gilda didn't do any of those things
you've been losing sleep over.

742
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:22,834
It was just an act, every bit of it.

743
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:28,632
But I'll give you credit,
you were a great audience.

744
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:50,989
Would you like a drink of ambrosia,
suitable only for a goddess?

745
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:54,436
No, thank you.

746
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:59,431
Mr. Obregon said the place had been
taken over by the government.

747
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:03,229
Don't think about it.

748
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:08,076
A cigarette, perhaps?
Blended of the finest tobaccos -

749
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:12,119
- from the most romantic places
of the world.

750
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:15,875
No, thank you.

751
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:26,468
- It all looks lonely, doesn't it?
- All bad things end up lonely.

752
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:35,157
I know that, don't I? You can keep
your silly epigrams to yourself.

753
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:56,394
Uncle Pio.

754
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:05,197
I hear you're going home.
I came to say goodbye.

755
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:21,034
I want to go with you, Gilda.
Please take me.

756
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:28,076
- I know I did everything wrong.
- Isn't it wonderful?

757
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:35,237
Nobody has to apologise, because
we were both such stinkers.

758
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,154
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Wonderful...

759
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:02,514
I didn't intend to come back
so soon, but I want my wife.

760
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:07,228
You thought I died that night.
I murdered a man, -

761
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:14,078
- so I disappeared for a while.
I came to the house to get Gilda.

762
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:21,828
I found her occupied with you. I had
no time for an emotional scene.

763
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:28,189
I had a launch waiting for me.
You didn't see me parachute out.

764
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:34,515
You weren't seeing very clearly that
night. Emotion clouds the brain.

765
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:40,755
I intended to kill you with this,
to have one friend kill the other.

766
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:48,508
But now it won't do,
because I have to kill Gilda, too.

767
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:55,833
I told you I'd be looking...

768
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:11,999
Better get out of here,
Uncle Pio, quick!

769
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:34,236
I'm a great cop,
and a pushover for a love story.

770
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:41,033
I know the combination of the safe,
but I don't know where it is.

771
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:44,351
It's on the wall, behind the desk.

772
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:48,832
Thanks. Say, haven't I seen
that cane somewhere before?

773
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,596
Yes. You shouldn't leave such things
lying around where I can reach them.

774
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:58,629
He's lying, like the gentleman
I always said he was. It was I...

775
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,679
- Keep your mouth shut!
- You two can quit being noble.

776
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:06,992
A man can only die once, and Mundson
killed himself three months ago.

777
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:12,359
Besides, didn't you ever hear of
a thing called justifiable homicide?

778
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:19,473
Johnny, let's go home.
Let's go home.

779
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:40,952
