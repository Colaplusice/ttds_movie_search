{29}{73}...but a screen personality.
{73}{156}And so I am very happy to have this|opportunity to introduce to you...
{156}{233}...the Soundtrack.
{233}{334}All right, come on.|That's all right. Don't be timid.
{394}{438}And a Soundtrack.
{438}{521}Now watching him, I discovered|that every beautiful sound also created...
{521}{571}...equally beautiful picture.
{571}{672}Now look, the Soundtrack|kindly produces a sound.
{684}{784}Go on! Don't be nervous.|Go ahead! Any sound.
{839}{939}Well, that isn't quite what I had in mind.
{952}{1052}I suppose we hear and see the harp.
{1489}{1589}Now one of the strings,|say the uhmm, the violin.
{2114}{2214}And now...|Now one of the woodwinds. A flute.
{2354}{2454}Very pretty.|Now let's have a brass instrument- the trumpet.
{2882}{2982}All right. Now, how about a low instrument?|The bassoon.
{3182}{3282}Go on. Go on, drop the other shoe,|will you?
{3394}{3483}Now to finish, suppose we see|some of the percussion instruments.
{3483}{3584}Beginning with the base drum.
{4134}{4202}Thanks a lot old man.
{4224}{4366}The symphony that Beethoven called "The Pastoral"|is said, is one of the few pieces of music...
{4366}{4431}...he ever wrote that tells|something like a definite story.
{4431}{4508}He was a great nature lover,|and in this symphony...
{4508}{4586}he paints a musical picture|of a day in the country.
{4586}{4687}Now of course, the country that Beethoven described|was the countryside with which he was familiar.
{4702}{4771}But his music covers a much wider field than that.
{4771}{4872}And so Walt Disney has given the Pastoral Symphony|a mythological setting.
{36897}{36993}Now we are going to do one of the most|famous and popular ballets ever written.
{36993}{37083}"The Dance of the Hours"|from Ponchielli's opera "La Gioconda".
{37083}{37138}It's a pageant of the hours of the day.
{37138}{37231}All this takes place in the great hall|with its garden beyond...
{37231}{37332}...of the palace of Duke Alvise,|a Venetian nobleman.
{55162}{55273}The last number on our "Fantasia" program|is a combination of two pieces of music...
{55273}{55416}...so utterly different in construction and mood|that they set each other out perfectly.
{55416}{55523}The first is "A Night on Bald Mountain"|by one of Russia's greatest composers...
{55523}{55571}...Modeste Moussorgsky.
{55571}{55671}The second is Franz Schubert's|world famous "Ave Maria."
{55671}{55753}Musically and dramatically, we have here|a picture of the struggle...
{55753}{55854}...between the profane and the sacred.
