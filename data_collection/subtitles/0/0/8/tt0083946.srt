1
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:20,443
<i>Cayahuari Yacu, the jungle Indians</i>
<i>call this country,</i>

2
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:25,388
<i>"the land where God did not</i>
<i>finish Creation."

3
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:31,957
<i>They believe only after man</i>
<i>has disappeared</i>

4
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:37,799
<i>will He return to finish His work.</i>

5
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,055
For God's sake...

6
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,151
If we're gonna
do this...

7
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,388
If we're gonna
do this...

8
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,124
...let's do it
in style.

9
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:16,259
We're going to miss Caruso if
you don't put some fire under it.

10
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:24,767
Oh, you've wiped oil all over your face.

11
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,241
Isn't that better?

12
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,647
Oh, Molly, please.

13
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,855
Come on, for God's sake!

14
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,788
Champagne for the horses! The best!

15
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,708
We're gonna make it.

16
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:50,447
Sir, Madam.
This is a gala performance.

17
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,510
We come from Iquitos, one thousand
two hundred miles down the Amazon.

18
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,913
I had to row because
our motor broke down.

19
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,252
Look at his hands.

20
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:03,723
For two days and two nights I've been
rowing to see Caruso once in my life.

21
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,286
You have no tickets.

22
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:10,028
This man needs to go in there.
He has no ticket but he has a right.

23
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,229
Sir, Madam, you can't go in there.

24
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,437
I'm going to build an opera house
in Iquitos and Caruso'll open it.

25
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,808
It'll be the greatest opera of the jungle.
Please, let us in.

26
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,906
You'll work with us. Let us in, please.

27
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:33,323
I'd like to be in there myself,
believe me...

28
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,652
Follow me!

29
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,344
Make sure to be quiet and press
yourselves right up against the wall.

30
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,818
He pointed to you.

31
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,320
He pointed to me. You see him...
he means me.

32
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:26,288
Fitzcarraldo? How do you spell it?

33
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,625
What an interesting name!

34
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:34,157
My father was Irish.
My real name is Fitzgerald.

35
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,063
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald.

36
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,159
They had trouble saying it in Peru.

37
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:44,175
Fitzgerald? Iquitos? You're not
the man with the railway are you?

38
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,144
Yeah, that's me.

39
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:55,654
Well... the Trans-Andean Railway, but...

40
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,250
...the project fell through.

41
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,759
But the idea was a bold one.

42
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:06,922
At the moment I'm trying my luck as
as ice producer, to make money.

43
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,861
Here, all people want...

44
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:14,269
...for their money are the
big names from Europe.

45
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:21,273
Sarah Bernhardt, an actress
who can't even sing.

46
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,778
But her wooden leg is
the talk of the town.

47
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:30,487
The ice, ah, I mean...

48
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,081
I'm doing all this because
I have one dream...

49
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,191
...the opera.

50
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,890
The Great Opera in the Jungle!

51
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,568
Fitzcarraldo will build it and
Caruso will sing at the premiere.

52
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,071
It's only the dreamers
who ever move mountains.

53
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:57,673
For five years now we've been
the richest town in the whole world.

54
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,808
It's like gold fever.

55
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,453
May I show you the house?

56
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,787
When this opera was built
there were only a few huts here.

57
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,227
The building was practically in the jungle.

58
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,823
Prices are ten times higher here
than in New York.

59
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:22,670
There are palaces being built with
tiles from Delft and Florentine marble.

60
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:27,769
And Iquitos is catching up.
It's still a filthy frontier town...

61
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,645
...but the rubber business is growing
by leaps and bounds.

62
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,846
The better-off citizens in Manaus,
if I may put it like that...

63
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,752
...send their laundry to Lisbon...

64
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:42,857
...because the water in the Amazon
is felt to be impure.

65
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,599
Aren't you going to stay?

66
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,502
I don't know.

67
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,441
I don't mind you're running a brothel.

68
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,309
But there are too many of
your clients around.

69
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:21,443
Come on. I train the girls
for the best households.

70
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,681
Much better than sending them
out on the streets.

71
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,389
I've nothing against the girls, Molly.

72
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:32,658
I just can't stand the sight of dandies
who think money can buy everything.

73
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,792
And the opera... I've got to work
on this ice production.

74
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,767
You could take a crack at respectability,
you know. Wouldn't kill you.

75
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,809
Respectability just made me bankrupt.

76
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,411
I'm better off down there by the river.

77
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,849
Got my real audience down there now...

78
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,942
The kids?

79
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,285
Yeah, that's my public. And a pig.

80
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:04,186
One of those lean racing pigs loves me.

81
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,297
How could she help it.

82
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,600
When I build my opera house...

83
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,804
...I'll see to it you have your own box
and a red velvet armchair.

84
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,389
It works through a chemical reaction
of two different salts.

85
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:30,263
Just imagine the possibilities ice has,
but people don't see it.

86
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,893
The children love it.

87
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,801
Yeah, they eat it.

88
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:37,875
Imagine, one day...

89
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,945
...ice in every warehouse,
on every ship.

90
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,807
Yes, make your bet.

91
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,651
What do you think of it?

92
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:28,158
I'll tell you what I think. You can
read up about ice in any school book.

93
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,627
It's out of the question
to apply for a patent.

94
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,824
But I have the experience,
and it's experience that counts.

95
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:40,530
What good is ice here?
To cool the rubber?

96
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:44,572
Maybe we should magically
create some glaciers in the jungle.

97
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:50,380
And then we'll build the Trans-Andean
Railroad on sled skids...

98
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,076
...loosen the brakes, give her a push...

99
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,677
...and adios! Off she goes,
sledding down into the valley?

100
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,486
Come on, come on.

101
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,193
Don't take it to heart.

102
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,664
Here, this is for you.

103
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,399
Use this, play a hand with us.

104
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,333
The precious feeling of losing money!

105
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,434
Nothing like it! Ecstasy!

106
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:23,841
The church remains closed 'til
this town has its opera house.

107
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,809
I want the opera house!

108
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,781
I want my opera house!

109
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,717
I want to have an opera!

110
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:43,426
This church remains closed 'til
this town has an opera!

111
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,494
I will build my opera!

112
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,147
I want to have my opera.

113
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:20,415
I could have let you cool your heels
in there for two weeks.

114
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,990
Thanks. Two days were
more than enough.

115
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,098
I'm sure Molly is behind this.

116
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:35,003
You're mistaken. But come with me.

117
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:38,633
I'll show you the real reason
I'm letting you out so soon.

118
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:52,857
They won't budge. I felt moved.
Even a horse would be touched.

119
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:01,459
That shouldn't be too hard to arrange.

120
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,900
All of them together, at the same time?

121
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,764
Don Aquilino, The Borja brothers...

122
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:13,470
I have my ways. Don't worry.
I'll bring all my girls with me.

123
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:16,877
We'll have all the rubber barons
gathered together like flies.

124
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,883
And I guarantee you,
they'll be feeling good.

125
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,479
I'll bring my phonograph.

126
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,618
You need some sprucing up first.

127
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,192
I'm not letting you out of
my house like that.

128
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,888
A steam bath for Mr. Fitzcarraldo!
Full treatment.

129
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,761
And then deliver him to my bedroom.

130
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:41,597
This is serious... help...
Hey Molly, tell them... Help!

131
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:54,478
Everyone wants money from me.
The hospital, the fire brigade...

132
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:57,316
...and now you keep talking
my ear off about your opera.

133
00:25:57,422 --> 00:26:00,152
It gives expression to
our deepest feelings.

134
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,488
What is he talking about?

135
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:06,028
Our deepest feelings!

136
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,495
Just take a look at this.

137
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,268
Come a bit closer.

138
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,099
Take a good look.

139
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,369
A little demonstration.

140
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,110
1000 dollar bills seem to taste best.

141
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:36,125
See how fast our money
goes down the drain?

142
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,354
You must have experienced this.

143
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,591
A railway is sure to swallow up
a lot of money.

144
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:46,199
How thrilling it must be to go bankrupt.

145
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,166
Let's return to our friends.

146
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,040
Yes, such a chance to meet all
one's friends and rivals in one place...

147
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,806
...does not present itself very often.

148
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:24,937
Rosita, over there!

149
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,442
Take the champagne over there!

150
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:37,110
Please, may we have your attention?

151
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,554
Please, come a bit closer.

152
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,871
Servant! Hold him!

153
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,570
He can't get away with this.

154
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:40,650
One moment! Please, please, please!

155
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:44,713
Ladies and gentlemen, don't worry.

156
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:51,317
This man is harmless, he's just had
a soul-stirring experience.

157
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,064
My servants will escort you
to the kitchen.

158
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,068
My dogs' cook will prepare you a meal.

159
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:04,232
Thank you very much, sir,
you were superb.

160
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,046
To your dogs' cook.

161
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,283
To Verdi.

162
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,150
To Rossini.

163
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,122
To Caruso.

164
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:25,390
To Fitzcarraldo, the
Conquistador of the Useless!

165
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,688
Cheers!

166
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:37,298
As true as I am standing here, one day
I shall bring grand opera to Iquitos.

167
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,011
I will outnumber you.

168
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,545
I will outbillion you.

169
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,981
I am the spectacle in the forest.

170
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,212
I am the inventor of rubber.

171
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,413
I will outrubber you.

172
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:58,053
Sir, the reality of your world
is nothing more...

173
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:01,365
...than a rotten caricature
of great opera.

174
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,629
Fitz, Fitz, let's go.

175
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:08,102
He's as dead as a doornail.
He is no opponent for you.

176
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:12,267
Madam, I'm still standing firm
on both my legs.

177
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,743
You're a big game hunter, aren't you?

178
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,005
What's that got to do with it?

179
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,710
Then you should know:
When you shoot an elephant...

180
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,812
...he sometimes stays on his legs
for ten days before he topples over.

181
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:29,160
Come on, girls, we're leaving. This way!

182
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:49,673
Rubber. That's the way to do it.
Forget about the ice.

183
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:56,017
You need a big steam-boat.
And most of all you need land.

184
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,918
And hundreds of workers.

185
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:03,289
The rubber barons have divided up
the land. But there's still some left.

186
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,793
How do you know?

187
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:08,229
Through Don Aquilino.
Why don't you pay him a visit?

188
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,857
Forget about it.

189
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,036
Why don't you try him out?

190
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:28,976
My territory begins right here
where the Pongo ends...

191
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:34,888
...and reaches downstream
for 80 miles.

192
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:36,984
And above the Pongo?

193
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,688
I'd like to have that myself.

194
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:43,459
We've thought about building
a road across the mountains...

195
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:48,369
...but it would be an impossible venture,
and there still wouldn't be...

196
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:53,137
A ship... And nobody
has made it upstream?

197
00:31:56,514 --> 00:32:01,076
Want to see for yourself?
We can go a little further by foot.

198
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,317
What's he saying?

199
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,627
We must be quiet.

200
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:13,128
He says, whoever talks...

201
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:16,667
...will be swallowed up by
the evil spirits of the rapids.

202
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:58,100
The Indians call the rapids
Chirimagua, "the angry spirits."

203
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:01,976
Anyone who falls in there is lost.

204
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:08,618
The native bare-asses also say,
"The water has no hair to hold on to."

205
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,144
Is this a rubber tree?

206
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:44,052
Right. Hevea brasiliensis.

207
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,399
They call the rubber tree caoutchou...

208
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,965
..."the tree that weeps."

209
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,134
These bare-asses love
flowery language.

210
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,677
Gold, they call "sweat of the sun."

211
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,737
Bees, "father of honey."

212
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:17,514
You know, it's no easy job
to civilize them, believe me.

213
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,603
How much do you think
this stinky stuff weighs?

214
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:42,846
132 pounds! And I presume you're
familiar with the market price.

215
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,240
How long does it take
to make one of them?

216
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,544
Three men one week.

217
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,760
Presently I have a staff of 8,500.

218
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:07,564
But I am thinking of increasing
to 10,000.

219
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:16,008
You're a strange bird,
but I must say I like you.

220
00:35:56,387 --> 00:36:01,290
That's my area. From the Pongo
to the mouth of the Ucayali.

221
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:06,352
Up there you see the Peruvian Amazon
Company, a joint stock company...

222
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,694
...and there, the Borja brothers.

223
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,594
What does that square mean?

224
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:15,934
That's the rubber region of the
Ucayali, about 14 million trees.

225
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,802
It's the only area still unclaimed.

226
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,744
Because of the rapids
of the Pongo das Mortes...

227
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:25,611
...you'd have to have wings
to fly into this area.

228
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:28,378
What about up on the Pachitea?

229
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:34,855
No rubber trees, maybe a few,
but not enough to make it worthwhile.

230
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:38,122
The only thing you'll find there
are savage Indians.

231
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:42,189
No gold, no rubber, no nothing.

232
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,391
Only head hunters...

233
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,133
The two rivers almost touch each other.

234
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,265
What?

235
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:58,845
How exact is this map?
Is there anything more precise?

236
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,576
Oh, it's a pretty good map.

237
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:07,918
In 1896 a group of surveyors and
soldiers got to the Upper Pachitea...

238
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:09,925
...but most of them were murdered.

239
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:15,488
Then some missionaries got as far as
Saramiriza, their farthest settlement.

240
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:20,626
From there on you'll find only
savage Jivaros and Campas.

241
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,332
Two padres ended up
as shrunken heads.

242
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:27,934
Have you ever seen a shrunken head?

243
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:31,406
Yes... I mean...

244
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:35,381
No... sort of...

245
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,473
Have you made your choice?

246
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:00,373
I can't decide... I guess I'll take both.

247
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:04,210
- Molly, listen!
- What is it?

248
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,110
I need your money,
every red cent you can spare.

249
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,311
- Oh Fitz, not again...
- I have an idea.

250
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,653
An amazing idea!

251
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,118
Here, look at this.

252
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:21,393
I've bought some maps,
I can explain everything to you.

253
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:40,547
First I have to contact a lawyer,
then get a ship.

254
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:43,553
But my money is not gonna
buy you a ship, Fitz.

255
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,035
You're squeezing me to death!

256
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,407
I can't breathe.

257
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,188
The document, please.
Thank you.

258
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,322
The act of territorial acquisition
is done step by step.

259
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:32,493
You and your partner sign,
you pay the money...

260
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:35,401
...and I will complete the document
with my signature.

261
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,405
Before you sign, I'd like to direct
your attention to the option clause.

262
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,306
What option clause?

263
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:48,483
Through its executive organs, the
Peruvian government is insistent...

264
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:54,115
...with no exceptions, that a region of
this size be taken into possession...

265
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,955
...by deed and by proof
within nine months.

266
00:39:57,027 --> 00:40:00,861
You will have to prove that real
operational steps...

267
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,627
...have been taken
to exploit the region.

268
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:07,431
Otherwise your right of exploitation
will be terminated.

269
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:11,565
The point is that the state is
concerned that areas such as this...

270
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:15,167
...are productively used by
competent men of business...

271
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:16,268
...so that they...

272
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,780
Come on, we are wasting time.

273
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:22,547
May I ask you a question
of a personal nature?

274
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,821
Do you really know what you're doing?

275
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,156
We're gonna do what
nobody's ever done.

276
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,560
We're going to be very, very rich.

277
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:37,723
Well?

278
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:44,532
Please, sir, sign on the dotted line.

279
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,555
That's it.

280
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,122
That's it.

281
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,698
Isn't it marvelous?

282
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,702
We should be able to fix it up.

283
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,476
It's wonderful.

284
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,673
You haven't seen the whole thing.

285
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,513
I like it already.

286
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,048
Watch out here.

287
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,980
Everything's rotted.

288
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,757
The engine room.

289
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:46,934
Up the stairs.

290
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:53,041
Wait a moment.

291
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,739
Wait. Let me go first.

292
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:16,961
To our contract!
Please come in, gentlemen.

293
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:33,382
Now that the purchase of my ship
is settled, let me be quite frank.

294
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:34,640
You bet.

295
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:39,746
I forced you to take Cholo as mechanic
or you wouldn't have gotten the ship.

296
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,851
I realize that.

297
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,823
Very good. Good.

298
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:51,129
He's a first-rate mechanic,
I'll tell you that much.

299
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,732
Now, what else is he?

300
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,332
The reason behind it all,
excuse my bluntness...

301
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:04,938
...is that I wish to be kept informed
about the activities of my competitors.

302
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:09,543
I don't want my territory contested.

303
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:11,745
Don't worry.

304
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,316
Every steamship owner
is a potential enemy...

305
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:19,362
...but those with just a canoe
can't hurt us.

306
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:24,157
The two of us have a bet going...

307
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,930
...how long it will take
until you go bankrupt.

308
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,870
Oh, don't take it personally, please.

309
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,670
We're all sportsmen, aren't we?

310
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,112
No, only one of us.

311
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:40,016
I shall move a mountain.

312
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,627
When is she gonna be ready?

313
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:29,930
Tomorrow. For days he's been
telling me tomorrow.

314
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:32,127
I hope she'll be ready for launching.

315
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:40,502
I wonder what this
character's really up to.

316
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,080
What's your name?

317
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,091
Paul Resenbrink. I'm Dutch.

318
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,994
They call me Orinoco Paul...

319
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:35,823
...because I know every goddamn
bend in this river.

320
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,863
You haven't sailed for some time.

321
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:44,539
That's right.
My last ship was the Adolfo.

322
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:48,303
My eyesight isn't so good,
but I cannot be fooled.

323
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:50,945
What do you mean?

324
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,778
The jungle plays tricks on your senses.

325
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:57,376
It's full of lies, demons, illusions.

326
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:03,122
I have learned to tell the difference
between reality and hallucinations.

327
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:09,356
I see that you took part in
the Pachitea expedition in 1886.

328
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,128
Yes, as helmsman.

329
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:13,835
On the return trip I was the captain.

330
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:18,502
The captain died.
There were only five survivors.

331
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:25,209
Paul Resenbrink, you have
captain's authority.

332
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,408
Help me choose the crew.

333
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:31,380
We need strong, fearless men.

334
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:34,849
I'm afraid we'll find few good men here.

335
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:37,085
First of all we need a pilot.

336
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,931
Does anyone have
experience as a pilot?

337
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:53,538
Scram, you puny runt!
I'm Huerequeque.

338
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:04,214
Brethren! I am Huerequeque!

339
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:07,316
I am the best cook in all of
el Amazonas.

340
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:10,915
I have been on every ship.

341
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:17,095
And amigo, I'm not stupid.
I know what your plans are.

342
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:20,968
Huerequeque may tip the bottle
now and then...

343
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:26,607
...but up here... electric, electrico!

344
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:35,547
Also, I am the best gunman
on the entire Amazon.

345
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:39,088
- What do you think of him?
- Upstream and downstream.

346
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:42,156
- Is he really a good gunman?
- I would have to say, yes.

347
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,889
What was your name? Huere...

348
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,462
Huerequeque.

349
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,098
Huerequeque, you are our cook.

350
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,371
Cheers, then.

351
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,003
Please understand.

352
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:06,708
Who bought the ship?
Who paid for the crew?

353
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,478
It's my right to come with you.

354
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:13,079
Molly, you can't leave the girls.
What are they gonna do without you?

355
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:15,384
And what will I do without you?

356
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,187
I'll be back.

357
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,423
Fitz... do you still love me?

358
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,062
We are partners, you and me.

359
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:26,656
Oh Fitz, you're crazy!

360
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:20,883
Oh Fitz, it's wonderful!

361
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:22,975
This is your day, Molly!

362
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:34,054
You've given the ship my name!

363
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:37,528
That's more than my poor
heart can stand.

364
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,567
Now comes the official part.

365
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:43,531
Here. Throw it... hard!

366
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:08,856
I don't want those seoritas
on board my ship.

367
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:12,867
These are my assistants.
I can't cook without them.

368
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,130
Come on, kids, come on.

369
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:05,317
Why isn't he going down to the Ucayali?

370
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,415
Why is he heading upstream?

371
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:10,959
I thought he was going
to the Pongo das Mortes.

372
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,426
You saw right.

373
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:15,828
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald
is going up the Amazon.

374
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,444
We're going upstream!
What's the idea?

375
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:14,048
We're going up the river.
That's the idea.

376
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:18,720
And, from now on, you only
leave the engine room if I say so.

377
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:48,712
What do you think you're doing?
Getting around my girls!

378
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,251
Get lost!

379
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:11,524
Don Fitzcarraldo! Don Fitzcarraldo!

380
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:17,266
You're back at last.
I'd almost given up hope.

381
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:21,441
Look here, Amazon Terminal
ready for action.

382
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,569
I see you've become a father.

383
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,844
I knew you'd come back.

384
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:31,353
I thought you'd forgotten about me
when the railroad construction ceased.

385
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:35,384
Every year I repaint
the first class booking office.

386
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:37,319
It looks a little weather-beaten...

387
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:40,794
...but wait until your trains cross
the mountains from the Amazon...

388
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,024
...to the Pacific,
then everything will change.

389
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:47,593
I've been here six years now,
without payment.

390
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:48,762
Therefore...

391
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:51,466
The engine is in good working order.

392
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:54,000
All the levers work, but...

393
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,601
But I must confess...

394
00:56:56,713 --> 00:57:01,980
...I was forced to sell a few iron parts
to the Indians.

395
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:06,852
They need it for their
machetes and things.

396
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:10,187
They used to come at night
to steal parts.

397
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:12,226
So I thought...

398
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:18,294
...it was better to sell than
to have things stolen at night.

399
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:23,900
I had to do it. I was left alone
and deserted on this post.

400
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:26,942
I thought you'd been sent home
like everybody else.

401
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,042
Let me show you outside.

402
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:34,378
The tracks reach 200 meters
deep into the jungle.

403
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:41,985
Come with me. I made an
invention to scare off the Indians.

404
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:45,559
They've become more cautious.
I do the same thing with the snakes.

405
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:47,857
I connect an electric line to the tracks.

406
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:54,933
The Indians get their fingers singed.
They won't touch them again.

407
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:00,674
I chase the snakes onto the rails
with a stick.

408
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:05,510
On the first rail they get fried,
on the second they turn to ash.

409
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:09,742
Every year, I cut back the bushes...

410
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,785
When will you resume construction?

411
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:19,084
The thing is... we've come here
on a different project.

412
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:24,389
Our whole financial situation will
change overnight, if it works.

413
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:28,396
What I'm trying to say is...

414
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,931
...we need the tracks
for another purpose.

415
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:49,214
No, not those from under the engine,
not those...

416
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,699
Don Fitzcarraldo.

417
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:06,699
The men are removing
the tracks under the locomotive.

418
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:10,370
I'm begging you, leave me just
a few yards to roll it back and forth.

419
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:14,474
Hey, leave those under there!
There's more out in the forest.

420
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:19,247
Thank you, thank you.

421
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:51,053
We should have reached
the Pachitea a long time ago.

422
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,455
No, we haven't.

423
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:56,121
But according to the map...

424
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,720
I don't rely on maps.

425
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,322
How can you be so sure about that?

426
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:19,841
No river tastes like the Pachitea.
It's just ahead of us.

427
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,479
Isn't that something...

428
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:42,231
Brimming over!

429
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:49,434
Oh, these women!

430
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,409
That's what I need.

431
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:43,465
What's going on here?

432
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,525
We're going up the Pachitea.

433
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:50,896
Is that so?

434
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,099
Where are we going?

435
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:30,607
Amigos, welcome to the Pachitea!

436
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:33,944
Known for it's native hospitality...

437
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:03,972
Something is going on down below.

438
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,208
They don't seem to agree
with our course.

439
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:10,011
What?

440
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:39,738
I told you in Iquitos I needed men,
not cowards who shit in their pants.

441
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:45,180
So...

442
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,389
Whoever wants to leave, step forward.

443
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:35,130
Welcome to Saramiriza!

444
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,869
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald.

445
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:45,337
We thought you were
a government commission.

446
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:47,611
Welcome to our place, here.

447
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:49,750
Welcome.

448
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:52,415
Happy to have you.

449
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:55,115
- I am Huerequeque.
- Welcome.

450
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,301
Thank you, thanks.

451
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,546
How can anyone learn patriotism
from a school book?

452
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:23,413
The Government requires it.

453
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:27,415
The natives get used to it
like vaccination.

454
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:30,553
The children already feel like Peruvians.

455
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,593
The other day I asked them...

456
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:34,227
..."Are you Indians?"

457
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:38,664
"No," they said, "not us,
the ones up the river are."

458
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,396
Then I asked, "What are Indians?"

459
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:43,864
They said, "Indians are people...

460
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:47,465
...who can't read and who don't know
how to wash their clothes."

461
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,737
And what do the older people say?

462
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:51,101
Well.

463
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,382
We can't seem to cure them
of the idea...

464
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:58,783
...that our everyday life
is only an illusion...

465
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:02,483
...behind which lies
the reality of dreams.

466
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:07,193
I am very interested in these ideas.

467
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:09,760
I specialize in opera myself.

468
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:15,462
What do you know about the
Jivaros on the upper Pachitea?

469
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:18,972
I was there during the disaster in '96.

470
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:21,270
Have you had any contact since then?

471
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:25,677
Some years ago, two of our brothers
set off with some natives.

472
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:28,147
One of them came back
a few days later...

473
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:31,913
...and said the Jivaros had
withdrawn deep into the forest.

474
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,581
The expedition
vanished without a trace.

475
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:38,587
A few weeks later, one of our
brothers was washed up.

476
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:42,255
They'd filled his stomach with
heavy stones and his head was gone.

477
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,828
Anyway, what do you want up there?

478
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:51,869
I'm planning something geographical.

479
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:55,532
Paul.

480
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:01,009
The crew.

481
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:09,382
Quiet down, you drunken idiots!
Stop it!

482
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:36,808
You have to crack down on the men,
or you can find yourself a new captain.

483
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:40,119
Who's causing trouble?

484
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:45,426
Evaristo Chavez and Fabiano,
the Brazilian. And the two women.

485
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:49,658
They must go ashore immediately,
they're the main ones.

486
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:53,995
And Huerequeque, he's smart
but not to be trusted.

487
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:06,908
Your services are no longer required.
I give you two minutes to get ashore.

488
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:10,179
You'll see, we're the lucky ones.

489
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:15,047
And the women.

490
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,615
Come on, move!

491
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:22,388
See to the rest!

492
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:27,401
And all of you, back to work. Go on!

493
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:09,524
Reduce speed! Half speed ahead!

494
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,996
What are the men doing?

495
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:29,934
They've armed themselves.

496
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,671
Under no circumstances
are they to shoot.

497
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,051
That was our mistake
on the first expedition.

498
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:43,448
Go down and tell them that,
or there'll be a disaster.

499
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:12,916
What the hell are you doing?

500
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:17,223
Just trying to have a little
conversation with our invisible friends.

501
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:20,693
Idiot, this will cost us our lives.
Yours first.

502
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:23,755
There are silences and silences.

503
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:27,389
And this one, I don't like at all.

504
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:38,095
There's something on the water.

505
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:42,070
Where?

506
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:45,871
Something black, floating towards us.

507
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:35,859
What's an umbrella doing here?

508
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:40,458
It must have belonged to one of the
missionaries that the Jivaros killed.

509
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:46,497
Strange.

510
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:55,006
Seems to be a last warning.
The bare-asses love flowery gestures.

511
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:57,881
I wish they would show themselves.

512
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:17,864
Now it's Caruso's turn.

513
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:55,802
Do you see the Indians in the canoe?

514
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:58,436
Could that be a trap?

515
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:03,742
It doesn't look like one.
No, I don't think so.

516
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:09,548
They would attack at night.
And in bigger groups.

517
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:15,917
Shall we stop and try to make contact?

518
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:20,461
No, don't stop.
They wouldn't talk to us anyway.

519
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:48,118
Something's moving over there.

520
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:55,896
Those bare-asses have never seen the
likes of this. Teach 'em some respect.

521
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,164
Everything depends on
how we behave.

522
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:43,169
Tell me everything
you know about them.

523
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:50,009
These Jivaro probably left the
interior of Brazil about 300 years ago.

524
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:53,579
For ten generations they've been
criss-crossing the jungle...

525
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:57,488
...in search of a white God
in a divine vessel.

526
01:19:57,592 --> 01:20:02,928
At the end of their pilgrimage
he would show them...

527
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:06,762
...a land without sorrow and death.

528
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:10,329
We're gonna take advantage
of this myth.

529
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:25,315
What the hell has that
got to do with us?

530
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:30,221
If a bare-ass comes too close,
I'll put a bullet right between his eyes.

531
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:32,925
But this God doesn't
come with canons.

532
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:37,262
He comes with the voice of Caruso.

533
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:35,480
Your loyal crew has deserted you.

534
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:38,054
That finishes this journey.

535
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,840
Why didn't you go with them?

536
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:57,605
Because I want this whole
damned ship to turn back.

537
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:03,311
Don't mess with me.
I'll do what I like around here.

538
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:09,581
Just keep the engine running.

539
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:26,405
Those bastards!

540
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:33,078
Suddenly they were all there
with their rifles.

541
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:41,420
I told you all along they were no good.
They'll never make it out of here.

542
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:44,219
There's only three of us left.
You, me and Cholo.

543
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:45,657
What, him?

544
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:51,289
Now we really need some Italian opera.

545
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:53,230
Don't you agree?

546
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:45,507
That's the end of it.
The dream is over.

547
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:54,281
Can you turn here?

548
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:59,256
A bit narrow, but it'll work.

549
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:13,837
It won't work.

550
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:18,639
Did you say something?

551
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,313
Turn around.

552
01:25:24,252 --> 01:25:26,015
Do you see what I see?

553
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:29,922
Just what we needed.

554
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:33,323
Breaking through there
would be the end of us.

555
01:25:33,995 --> 01:25:37,158
There's just one way to go...
straight ahead.

556
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:42,360
You better pull ashore.

557
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:47,137
Go down to the engine room,
very casually.

558
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:57,312
They're armed...
with bows and arrows.

559
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,083
But they're keeping their distance.
Ever seen this before?

560
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:04,386
No, never.

561
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:16,969
Damn it, now they are
blocking the way.

562
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:54,136
Are they still there?

563
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:59,336
Even more of them now.
Maybe a hundred canoes.

564
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:02,382
Give me a shout when the fun begins.

565
01:27:02,483 --> 01:27:06,112
I wanna brighten up my last hour
with a little fireworks.

566
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:45,824
Brethren, what time is it, anyway?

567
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:50,556
Over here, bare-asses,
I'll pour you a beer.

568
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:53,759
Hurry up, I'll buy you a drink.

569
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:55,165
Where did you come from?

570
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:58,967
I just had a nap. Have the others quit?

571
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:03,374
I figured they would.
Cowards, degenerados! Imbciles!

572
01:28:03,478 --> 01:28:04,843
Shut up!

573
01:33:01,442 --> 01:33:03,069
What do they say?

574
01:33:03,177 --> 01:33:05,168
They're talking about our ship...

575
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:10,717
...the "white vessel" from which
they expect the promised salvation.

576
01:33:10,818 --> 01:33:15,346
They say there's a curse
weighing on the entire land.

577
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:20,893
They know that we are not gods,
but the ship has really impressed them.

578
01:33:20,995 --> 01:33:24,863
But why do they play the flute?
What is happening?

579
01:33:37,011 --> 01:33:41,107
My friends, I think we will continue.

580
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:42,065
See the red cliff on the right hand side?

581
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,575
Yes, I see it.

582
01:34:44,445 --> 01:34:46,003
That must be it.

583
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:51,948
Good. We can't go much further,
or we'll run onto a sandbank.

584
01:34:53,487 --> 01:34:55,785
That slope may look insignificant...

585
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:58,181
...but it's gonna be my destiny.

586
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:19,274
Come on, follow me!

587
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:26,652
Now he's showing his cards.

588
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:53,704
This is it.

589
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:00,653
This is what we were looking for.

590
01:36:01,355 --> 01:36:03,949
Here? This?

591
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:10,795
Do we have to climb a tree
for you dimwits to understand?

592
01:36:10,865 --> 01:36:14,494
We'll build a nice platform
for the gentlemen. Up there.

593
01:36:38,926 --> 01:36:41,292
I can hardly believe it.

594
01:36:42,163 --> 01:36:44,893
There. There's the Ucayali.

595
01:36:47,001 --> 01:36:50,266
All the river above the
Pongo das Mortes belongs to us.

596
01:36:50,371 --> 01:36:54,205
I know, I know.
We'll make a railway tunnel.

597
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:55,366
No.

598
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:59,541
We're going to drag that
ship over the mountain.

599
01:36:59,747 --> 01:37:02,272
And the bare-asses
are going to help us.

600
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,982
How the hell are we going to do that?

601
01:37:05,085 --> 01:37:07,610
Just like the cow jumped
over the moon.

602
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:09,986
I like this.

603
01:37:13,561 --> 01:37:14,892
Count me in.

604
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:26,297
Come in.

605
01:37:32,413 --> 01:37:33,539
What is it?

606
01:37:33,647 --> 01:37:36,514
I still don't understand
what you've got in mind.

607
01:37:38,085 --> 01:37:39,677
Come in. I'll show you.

608
01:37:47,728 --> 01:37:48,956
This...

609
01:37:50,297 --> 01:37:52,424
...is the Amazon.

610
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:55,558
Here is Iquitos.

611
01:37:57,137 --> 01:37:58,604
This...

612
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:03,101
...is the Ucayali.

613
01:38:05,246 --> 01:38:06,270
Right?

614
01:38:07,414 --> 01:38:08,676
And here...

615
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:15,017
...this is the Pachitea.

616
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:23,320
So, first we went up the Amazon...

617
01:38:24,598 --> 01:38:27,260
...and then up the Pachitea.

618
01:38:27,368 --> 01:38:29,495
We are here right now...

619
01:38:30,604 --> 01:38:35,098
...and we'll drag the ship
over this mountain.

620
01:38:35,643 --> 01:38:36,837
Exactly there.

621
01:38:39,647 --> 01:38:43,845
From here to here
we'll operate the ship...

622
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:47,478
...to collect rubber from
thousands of workers.

623
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:50,386
Why didn't we move up the Ucayali?

624
01:38:51,025 --> 01:38:53,550
Because of the Pongo das Mortes.

625
01:38:53,727 --> 01:38:57,754
Nobody will ever make it
through those rapids.

626
01:38:57,865 --> 01:39:02,598
Yes, but how do you get the rubber
to Iquitos? We need another ship.

627
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:07,340
We'll carry it back over the mountain
and build a settlement there.

628
01:39:07,441 --> 01:39:12,970
Soon we'll be so rich we'll have all
the ships we need to take it to Iquitos.

629
01:39:15,683 --> 01:39:18,777
- I've explained our project to the Chief.
- What's his answer?

630
01:39:18,886 --> 01:39:20,478
He just says yes.

631
01:41:48,802 --> 01:41:50,235
More to the left.

632
01:41:51,805 --> 01:41:52,965
A little more.

633
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:54,529
Stop!

634
01:41:55,242 --> 01:41:57,107
Again, a bit more to the left.

635
01:41:59,146 --> 01:42:00,306
A little more.

636
01:42:01,048 --> 01:42:02,106
Stop!

637
01:42:03,917 --> 01:42:05,475
Yes, yes!

638
01:42:09,923 --> 01:42:13,620
T-square at 42 degrees.

639
01:42:47,628 --> 01:42:49,459
Not a bad start, was it?

640
01:42:49,563 --> 01:42:50,552
Right.

641
01:42:52,699 --> 01:42:56,294
There are even children here.
It's a good sign.

642
01:43:08,048 --> 01:43:09,481
What do you think, Paul...

643
01:43:09,583 --> 01:43:12,211
...will the Indians stick with us?

644
01:43:12,286 --> 01:43:14,618
You can't tell what they really think.

645
01:43:14,721 --> 01:43:18,452
But how the hell are we gonna
get that ship over the hill?

646
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:24,390
If nothing else works,
then we'll make a tunnel.

647
01:43:25,165 --> 01:43:26,894
I could even do it alone...

648
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,931
...if we had a perfect pulley system.

649
01:43:32,506 --> 01:43:36,033
But I would need ten miles of rope
and it would take me ten weeks...

650
01:43:36,143 --> 01:43:38,202
...to pull the ship ten inches.

651
01:43:38,312 --> 01:43:40,974
Unfortunately, we haven't
got that much time.

652
01:43:41,148 --> 01:43:44,345
We have seven more months
before the option runs out.

653
01:43:44,618 --> 01:43:48,247
We have a winch and the
strength of hundreds of Indians.

654
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:51,388
We are going to drag this ship
over the mountain.

655
01:44:24,625 --> 01:44:26,456
Who are your little friends?

656
01:44:27,394 --> 01:44:30,454
McNamara, he's my footman.

657
01:44:30,564 --> 01:44:33,089
And this is el comandante.

658
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:36,630
Here's to you, McNamara.

659
01:45:30,357 --> 01:45:33,053
This is much steeper than we thought.

660
01:45:34,861 --> 01:45:36,761
Now, with the trees cut down...

661
01:45:38,265 --> 01:45:40,631
...you can really see how steep it is.

662
01:45:41,868 --> 01:45:45,668
We have to level the ground,
build a ramp.

663
01:45:47,107 --> 01:45:52,272
And up there we'll have to make
a cut through to the top.

664
01:45:52,846 --> 01:45:55,041
That could take months.

665
01:45:55,148 --> 01:45:56,376
Dynamite!

666
01:45:56,583 --> 01:45:58,608
I hope we have enough dynamite.

667
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:00,983
Careful, that'll frighten the bare-asses.

668
01:46:01,888 --> 01:46:03,685
We have no choice.

669
01:47:03,216 --> 01:47:05,582
Take cover! Get back!

670
01:47:05,685 --> 01:47:07,983
Watch out! Danger!

671
01:47:14,861 --> 01:47:18,422
Hold it, hold it! Where are you going?

672
01:47:19,399 --> 01:47:22,630
Now go back to work, come on.

673
01:49:55,055 --> 01:49:57,751
Those logs up there.
Huerequeque, come here.

674
01:50:02,929 --> 01:50:06,865
How can this trunk withstand
the pull of hundreds of tons?

675
01:50:06,967 --> 01:50:11,199
It will. See how deep we have
anchored it in the ground.

676
01:50:12,739 --> 01:50:14,229
As tough as iron.

677
01:50:15,542 --> 01:50:17,009
Bring it down here!

678
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:38,154
Huerequeque, come with me.

679
01:52:55,101 --> 01:52:56,295
Go on.

680
01:52:58,805 --> 01:52:59,999
Slowly.

681
01:53:01,207 --> 01:53:03,471
If we had known that you planned...

682
01:53:03,576 --> 01:53:07,171
...to move the boat on railway tracks...

683
01:53:07,747 --> 01:53:10,545
...I could have told you to
leave the tracks right there...

684
01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:12,641
...back at your Amazon station.

685
01:53:21,594 --> 01:53:24,119
Sorry I can't help you.

686
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:26,921
I had a bit too much to drink yesterday.

687
01:53:49,856 --> 01:53:52,256
Shouldn't we tell him that it
melts away to nothing?

688
01:53:52,358 --> 01:53:55,555
Doesn't work. There's no
word for ice in their language.

689
01:54:39,639 --> 01:54:41,231
Come on, get out of there!

690
01:54:41,341 --> 01:54:42,706
Out! Out!

691
01:54:45,011 --> 01:54:46,774
Give it a go!

692
01:55:50,710 --> 01:55:52,234
Give it all you got!

693
01:55:58,351 --> 01:56:00,376
I'll be damned...
It's working.

694
01:56:01,187 --> 01:56:02,484
It's moving.

695
01:56:03,289 --> 01:56:05,587
- It's moving!
- It's moving!

696
01:56:17,437 --> 01:56:18,665
Watch out!

697
01:59:02,602 --> 01:59:06,038
They've been staring at the river for
two days and two nights now.

698
01:59:06,806 --> 01:59:09,434
I'm sure it's because of
the terrible accident.

699
01:59:09,575 --> 01:59:12,237
I can't get anything out of them.

700
01:59:32,565 --> 01:59:33,554
And?

701
01:59:34,534 --> 01:59:35,660
They're gone.

702
01:59:35,768 --> 01:59:39,465
All of them?
They've really disappeared?

703
01:59:39,872 --> 01:59:41,806
What do you make of this?

704
01:59:42,275 --> 01:59:45,369
I had this strange feeling,
so I went outside.

705
01:59:45,745 --> 01:59:49,875
Not a soul, nothing.
They've all disappeared.

706
01:59:50,049 --> 01:59:51,846
That can mean anything.

707
01:59:51,984 --> 01:59:55,351
It could mean that they'll attack us.

708
01:59:55,755 --> 01:59:59,691
But the boy is still here.
My footman, McNamara.

709
02:00:00,493 --> 02:00:03,291
For that he'll be made Chief one day.

710
02:00:56,515 --> 02:01:00,076
They're back as if they'd
never been gone.

711
02:01:04,156 --> 02:01:07,125
Don't ask me for an explanation.

712
02:01:27,647 --> 02:01:30,878
I can't believe this crazy thing
Huerequeque has thought up.

713
02:01:32,218 --> 02:01:37,383
Amigos, the engine is running.
Now that's what I call brainwork.

714
02:01:37,490 --> 02:01:38,616
All you do is drink!

715
02:01:38,724 --> 02:01:43,491
We could start up the engine and
drive the anchor winch off of it.

716
02:01:43,596 --> 02:01:48,659
That way the ship will pull itself up
the mountain under it's own steam.

717
02:03:37,843 --> 02:03:39,333
Now, what do you say to that?

718
02:03:39,445 --> 02:03:42,209
There are times when a peasant's
brain is good for something.

719
02:03:42,314 --> 02:03:43,941
You ain't no peasant!

720
02:03:44,049 --> 02:03:47,246
You're the finest drunkard ever
to stagger over this earth.

721
02:03:47,553 --> 02:03:49,418
- But we forgot something.
- What?

722
02:03:49,488 --> 02:03:52,252
Enrico! Enrico Caruso!

723
02:05:41,901 --> 02:05:43,596
Why are they doing all this?

724
02:05:45,604 --> 02:05:48,334
Why are they working like dogs for us?

725
02:05:50,643 --> 02:05:51,632
Why?

726
02:05:53,279 --> 02:05:55,008
Why? Why?

727
02:05:56,115 --> 02:05:57,480
Why?

728
02:05:59,618 --> 02:06:03,611
- Why?
- No, I don't know either.

729
02:06:04,089 --> 02:06:07,752
The only thing I know is that
there must be a reason for it.

730
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:11,455
They're planning something, I bet.

731
02:06:25,311 --> 02:06:27,074
You must drink it.

732
02:06:27,346 --> 02:06:30,213
It is yucca.
Yucca with fermented saliva.

733
02:06:30,316 --> 02:06:31,783
Go on, drink!

734
02:06:31,884 --> 02:06:35,786
My God, time is flying
and we are getting nowhere.

735
02:09:15,047 --> 02:09:16,571
Something's up.

736
02:09:16,682 --> 02:09:20,584
The men are preparing barbasco,
a very strong poison.

737
02:09:20,686 --> 02:09:23,450
And they are painted black.

738
02:09:25,491 --> 02:09:29,188
But most of the men have hidden in the
woods and have armed themselves.

739
02:09:42,574 --> 02:09:44,064
What does that mean?

740
02:09:44,176 --> 02:09:47,737
As far as I know, the paint is
supposed to make them invisible.

741
02:09:47,846 --> 02:09:53,216
They only do that when they go
hunting or when they go to war.

742
02:09:55,921 --> 02:09:58,822
Let's return to the ship,
load our rifles.

743
02:09:58,891 --> 02:10:01,223
We wouldn't stand a chance.

744
02:10:18,844 --> 02:10:21,870
It seems to me that they
are planning something.

745
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:27,919
And I fear that we four will soon
end up as shrunken heads.

746
02:10:29,221 --> 02:10:31,553
I think we're safe for the moment.

747
02:10:32,057 --> 02:10:33,786
How do you know?

748
02:10:34,226 --> 02:10:36,387
There is a sign.

749
02:10:37,429 --> 02:10:38,418
Look...

750
02:10:39,598 --> 02:10:41,759
See those hands on the railing?

751
02:20:40,131 --> 02:20:41,462
What has happened?

752
02:20:43,134 --> 02:20:47,298
The Pongo! We're drifting into
the Pongo! Cholo!

753
02:20:59,784 --> 02:21:00,808
Cholo!

754
02:21:01,653 --> 02:21:04,178
Paul! Cholo!

755
02:21:04,322 --> 02:21:06,187
I must stop the ship!

756
02:21:13,965 --> 02:21:17,230
Start the fire!
We're drifting into the Pongo!

757
02:21:17,335 --> 02:21:18,996
The valves first!

758
02:21:50,802 --> 02:21:53,066
For God's sake, my ship!

759
02:22:11,456 --> 02:22:12,582
Damn it.

760
02:22:12,824 --> 02:22:14,621
Now it's too late.

761
02:25:39,097 --> 02:25:40,621
Do you know what he says?

762
02:25:40,732 --> 02:25:44,133
He says they untied the boat last night.

763
02:25:44,235 --> 02:25:47,864
They knew all along the divine vessel
was only dragged over the mountain...

764
02:25:47,972 --> 02:25:50,167
...so that it could drift
through the rapids.

765
02:25:50,274 --> 02:25:55,007
It had to be done to soothe
the evil spirits of the rapids.

766
02:25:55,113 --> 02:25:57,445
I must stop my ship.

767
02:27:32,210 --> 02:27:35,270
First of all, have a drink.

768
02:27:35,346 --> 02:27:39,112
Running the Pongo das Mortes
with a steamship...

769
02:27:39,217 --> 02:27:42,380
...is a record that will
never be repeated.

770
02:27:42,486 --> 02:27:44,147
Here, have a drink.

771
02:27:45,790 --> 02:27:50,454
Wonderful, gentlemen.
Quite spectacular.

772
02:27:51,696 --> 02:27:55,757
Here's to the reconciliation
of the evil spirits of the Pongo.

773
02:28:08,112 --> 02:28:10,273
I'll tell you a story.

774
02:28:11,749 --> 02:28:14,547
At the time when North America
was hardly explored...

775
02:28:15,119 --> 02:28:18,748
...one of those early French trappers
went westward from Montreal...

776
02:28:21,259 --> 02:28:24,558
...and he was the first white man
to set eyes on Niagara Falls.

777
02:28:26,497 --> 02:28:31,628
When he returned, he told of waterfalls
that were more vast and immense...

778
02:28:31,736 --> 02:28:34,227
...than people had ever dreamed of.

779
02:28:35,873 --> 02:28:37,568
But no one believed him.

780
02:28:38,042 --> 02:28:40,408
They thought he was
a madman or a liar.

781
02:28:42,513 --> 02:28:44,811
They asked him, "What's your proof?"

782
02:28:46,684 --> 02:28:48,379
And he answered...

783
02:28:51,188 --> 02:28:52,678
"My proof is...

784
02:28:55,092 --> 02:28:56,889
...that I have seen them."

785
02:29:06,704 --> 02:29:08,001
Sorry.

786
02:29:08,973 --> 02:29:11,601
I don't really know what that's
got to do with me.

787
02:29:17,715 --> 02:29:19,376
What will you do next?

788
02:29:20,484 --> 02:29:21,746
I don't know.

789
02:29:22,420 --> 02:29:27,790
I'm asking because I'm interested
in buying the boat back.

790
02:29:28,025 --> 02:29:31,119
My business has been
expanding lately.

791
02:29:31,896 --> 02:29:34,956
The damage could be repaired
in a few days.

792
02:29:35,132 --> 02:29:40,536
Oh, I assure you, I don't mean to
exploit your delicate situation.

793
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:49,039
I just heard, that a European opera
ensemble has arrived in Manaus...

794
02:29:49,146 --> 02:29:51,740
...to give a guest performance there.

795
02:29:51,849 --> 02:29:54,283
Perhaps you should go there.

796
02:29:54,452 --> 02:29:59,048
They are performing an opera of this
fantastic German composer.

797
02:29:59,523 --> 02:30:01,616
One of the very modern ones.

798
02:30:01,726 --> 02:30:06,754
Federico, Roberto... Ricardo...
What's his name, Ricardo...?

799
02:30:06,864 --> 02:30:08,058
Wagner?

800
02:30:08,399 --> 02:30:10,196
He's the one who wrote Parsifal.

801
02:30:10,601 --> 02:30:11,863
Yes, I guess that's the one.

802
02:30:12,069 --> 02:30:14,367
Very Teutonic, his music.

803
02:30:14,472 --> 02:30:17,464
And the name of the Opera
is "The Puritans".

804
02:30:18,075 --> 02:30:21,067
No, no, that's an Italian opera, by Bellini.

805
02:30:26,817 --> 02:30:28,148
Tell me...

806
02:30:30,721 --> 02:30:32,712
...did you mean that about the boat?

807
02:30:35,826 --> 02:30:39,557
Hey, Cholo, Huerequeque,
come over here!

808
02:30:42,233 --> 02:30:43,461
Come on.

809
02:30:46,137 --> 02:30:49,766
Paul, this is the new
owner of the Molly Aida.

810
02:30:49,874 --> 02:30:52,468
But we still have the
ship for two more weeks.

811
02:30:53,177 --> 02:30:55,975
Paul, listen.

812
02:30:57,982 --> 02:31:00,815
You'll travel to Manaus
with all this money.

813
02:31:02,053 --> 02:31:05,853
You'll bring back a tailcoat and
the best cigar in the world.

814
02:31:07,091 --> 02:31:10,618
And from the theater I want
an armchair with red velvet upholstery.

815
02:31:10,728 --> 02:31:14,323
I have to keep a promise to a pig
that loves Caruso so much.

816
02:31:18,436 --> 02:31:21,428
And then...
