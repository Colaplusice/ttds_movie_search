1
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,557
Excuse me, can you tell me this
where Delmare Berry lives?

2
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,918
He ain't here.

3
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,233
Go on inside.

4
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,869
He's a friend of mine, he wrote
this address down, right here.

5
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,835
Here.

6
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,232
You can see that's Delmare's writing.
I sure had a hard time finding this place.

7
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,036
- That's his writin'.
- Like I said, he's a friend.

8
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,314
My name is John Rambo.
We served on the same team together in 'Nam.

9
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,672
I don't know if he ever talked about me.

10
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,635
I've got a picture of us together.

11
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,073
Somewhere.

12
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,795
This junk in my pocket!

13
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,832
Here... here it is.

14
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,951
That's me, that's Danforth,
Westmore, Bronson, Ortega,

15
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,597
and there's Delmare, right in the back.
Had to put him in the back because he's so big...

16
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,318
if we didn't, he'd take up the whole picture.
- Delmare's gone.

17
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,432
- What time will he be back?
- He died.

18
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,875
What?

19
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,752
Died last summer.

20
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,513
Died how?

21
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,755
Cancer. Brought it back from 'Nam.

22
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,957
All that orange stuff
they spread it around.

23
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,473
Cut him down to nothing.
I could lift him off the sheets.

24
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,712
I'm very sorry.

25
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,279
Morning Amy! How are you doing, girls?
- Great, thanks. - Alright this morning?

26
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,395
- Andy!
- Howdy, Will!

27
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,193
Good morning, Dave. - Hi, Sheriff.
- Gonna take a bath this week?

28
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,675
Morning!

29
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,557
You visiting someone around here?

30
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,155
No.

31
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,634
You know, wearing that flag on your jacket,
looking the way you do...

32
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,398
You're asking for trouble around here, friend.

33
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,636
- Headed north or south?
- North.

34
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,509
Jump in, I'll make sure you're
headed in the right direction.

35
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,515
- Where you heading?
- Portland.

36
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,076
Portland's is South, you said you were headed North.

37
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,671
You got some place I can eat around here?

38
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,189
There's a diner about 30 miles up the highway.

39
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,470
- Is there a law against me getting something to eat here?
- Yeah, me.

40
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,159
Why are you pushing me?

41
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,994
What did you say?

42
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,391
I said why are you pushing me,
I haven't done anything to you.

43
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,798
First of all, you don't ask the questions
around here, I do. Understand?

44
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,268
Secondly, we don't want guys like you in this town.

45
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,109
Drifters.

46
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,588
First thing you know we got a whole bunch
of guys like you in this town. That's why!

47
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,399
Besides, you wouldn't like it here,
This is a quiet little town.

48
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,351
In fact you might say it's boring.
But that's the way we like it.

49
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,630
And I get paid to keep it that way.

50
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,314
Boring.

51
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,476
Portland, straight ahead.

52
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,437
If you want some friendly advice...

53
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,989
Get your hair cut and take a bath.
You wouldn't get hassled so much.

54
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,715
Hope this ride helped you out.

55
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,311
Have a nice day, huh?

56
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,871
Where the hell do you think you're going?

57
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,630
I'm talking to you, goddammit!

58
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,997
Let's see some I.D.!

59
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,108
All right, you're under arrest!

60
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,638
Put your hands on the car.

61
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,548
You put your hands on the car,
and you spread them.

62
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,828
You're going to put your hands on that car,

63
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,316
How you do it you decide, right now!

64
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,998
Legs back.

65
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,399
Back!

66
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,228
You try to be nice to some people!

67
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,196
Well, what do we have here?

68
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,111
- Why would you be carrying a knife like this?
- Hunting.

69
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,112
Don't be a wise guy!
What do you hunt with a knife?
- Name it.

70
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,391
Hi, Will.
- Lester.

71
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,356
Buzz us in, will ya.
- Hey, talk about your sorry looking humanity.

72
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,314
Just another smartass drifter.

73
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,029
Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Will. What do you got?

74
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,316
I want you to book this gentleman for vagrancy,
resisting arrest carrying a concealed weapon.

75
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,356
- He says he uses it for hunting.
- Huntin'? What do you hunt, elephants?

76
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,190
See if you can clean him up a little.
Smells like an animal.

77
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,515
Hey, Mitch.

78
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,669
- Escort this young man downstairs.
- Yes sir, Mr. Galt. Right this way, partner.

79
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,830
OK, here we go.

80
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,753
You know it looks like it'll take
old Leroy 10 years to paint this hall
- Why don't you paint it your damned self!!

81
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,590
Come on, Leroy, sling that paint, boy.
- Mr. Ward,

82
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,996
Take these.
- Thank you.

83
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,035
Name?

84
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,029
Your name

85
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,114
If you're looking for trouble,
you came to the right place, buddy!

86
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,073
Wait.

87
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,630
You got three seconds before I break your face in.

88
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,913
He means it.

89
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,554
Yeah, I do.

90
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,349
What do you know about that.
Old Harry here is a soldier

91
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,555
Rambo.

92
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,995
John J.?

93
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,870
You're gonna talk to me.

94
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,636
I promise you're gonna talk to me, soldier.

95
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,791
I'm starting to dislike you.

96
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,315
A lot.

97
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,436
I'm gonna run a make on him.

98
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,630
Put his name in the Teletype.

99
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,955
Just roll it across.

100
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,719
Roll it across!

101
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,756
- Push it.
- It won't work that way
it'll only smear. Now, roll it across!

102
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,113
Look, you son of a bitch, if you don't put your
god damned hand down there, I'm gonna break it off!

103
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,394
Put it down, god dammit!
- What the hell's going on down here?

104
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,274
Nothing I can't handle.

105
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,590
He won't let us print him well.
Leave the ink on the hand!

106
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,830
Just what is your problem?

107
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,638
As things stand right now, you're facing
the ass end of a 90 day incarceration!

108
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,676
Plus a 250 dollar fine which you don't
look to me like you can pay.

109
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,955
At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning you're going up
in front of that judge. And you think we're tough!

110
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,154
We're going to make you more presentable
for your courtroom appearance.

111
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,118
Between now and then, you can just impress
the hell out of me by doing exactly as you're told.

112
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,433
Clean him up.

113
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,399
Preston, go over there
and get that hose ready, alright?

114
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,635
Holy shit, look at this!
What the hell's he been in to?

115
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,911
Who gives a shit?

116
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,238
Hands above your head and turn around.

117
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,078
Oh Christ, we should report this to Teasle.
Look at that!

118
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,034
You just do what I tell you.

119
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,670
Galt, what the fuck was that?

120
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,074
The man said 'clean him up'.

121
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,597
Clean him up!

122
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,238
Hey, Preston, don't forget
to get him behind the ears!

123
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,152
How'd you like that, huh?

124
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,990
What's the matter, Mitch,
don't you like water sports?

125
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,709
Hurry it up, it's time for my coffee break.
Alright, sit down.

126
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,115
Sit down!

127
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,914
Damn it, boy's hard to get a hold of!

128
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,950
That's OK, Ward, don't worry about the soap, he's tough.
Just shave him. Dry!

129
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,992
How blind are you? Can't you see he's crazy?
- Can't you see I don't give a shit?

130
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,715
Yeah, I can see that.
- That's better.

131
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,232
See there, I knew that you..

132
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,038
We're just going to shaving you partner, take it easy.
- Take this, Mitch.

133
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,835
Don't move...

134
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,431
I don't want you to cut your own throat.

135
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,076
You asshole!

136
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,238
What the hell...

137
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,034
I'll kill the asshole!
- Art, don't shoot!

138
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,473
There's people down there!
Get help! I'll go after him!

139
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,797
Get out of the way!

140
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,516
Son of a bitch!

141
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,997
Lester, this is Will. I'm right on his tail.

142
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,715
He's just east of Smith's farm,
headed towards Chapman Creek.

143
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,395
I know you can hear me!

144
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,997
You're finished!
You're gone as far as you're going to go!

145
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,032
D'you hear me?

146
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,309
He's up there behind the draw.

147
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,630
Mitch, get Orval on the radio. Tell him to get out
here with his damned dogs right away.

148
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,312
Tell him to bring the Dobermen! lt's gonna rain,
we need dogs that can hunt on sight.

149
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,594
Lester, tell Paul to get out to the
lumber camp to get the helicopter up here.

150
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,192
If they give him any shit, tell him to site
him for obstruction right on the spot.

151
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,032
We'll get him.

152
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,589
No problem.

153
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,838
Go on, Hooch! Thunder, lets get him!

154
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,077
Come on sweethearts

155
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,757
We'll get him!

156
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,716
Won't be long before he's stuffed and mounted.
- make him into a bear rug.

157
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,039
Didn't we go hunting here last year?
Ya I got a couple of bucks last year.

158
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,311
Mitch, up the hill!

159
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,428
Get these hounds away from me, Orval!
I don't trust those bastards.

160
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,555
Keep moving, my dogs can eat
and run at the same time!

161
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,677
He's going straight to the top.
- Isn't that supposed to be dangerous? - He's just dumb!

162
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,877
Hey, you're spoiling the scent.
Let my babies do their job!

163
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,795
This is no good.
- Why?

164
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,631
there were three of us in the cell block down there.
He went through us like we weren't even there.

165
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,359
Come on!

166
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,309
We've got him, he's trapped!
- Art, he's heading for Chapman's gorge.

167
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,637
Head him off!

168
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,832
There he is! On the cliff!

169
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,392
Son of a bitch!

170
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,828
What the hell's going on?

171
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,589
What are you doing?
We're just supposed to spot him!

172
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,749
Hold it steady.
- I can't, we're in a thermal draft.

173
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,112
He's stuck there, he can't go any place.

174
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,873
If you don't ride this thing right
I swear to God, I'll kill you!

175
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,592
Sheriff to Galt! Come in Galt.

176
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,033
Hold it steady, you son of a bitch!

177
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,710
Galt, come in, God damn it!

178
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,117
Get closer and hold it steady!
- Galt, talk to me! I want to know what's going on.

179
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,195
I got him... easy now.

180
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,394
Over there, dummy! Come on!

181
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,997
Hey, soldier boy!

182
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,799
Galt, get on this radio! What's going on up there?

183
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,116
I don't want him dead, Galt, I want him alive!
You hear me? Art, come in!

184
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,435
Art Galt, come in!
Helicopter, come, dammit!

185
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,877
Christ, look!

186
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,392
Jesus Christ, give me the binoculars!

187
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,229
Oh no! Shit!

188
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,276
- I can't figure it. How did fall out?
- Does it matter?

189
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,280
Let's nail this sucker's ass...
he can't be far.

190
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,755
Look!

191
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,475
Looks like he wants to turn himself in.

192
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,350
There's one man is dead. lt's not my fault.
I don't want any more hurt.

193
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,028
Freeze!

194
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,630
Stay there and give yourself up!

195
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,911
But I didn't do anything!

196
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,510
I'm warning you, boy, don't make a move, I'll blow your head off!

197
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,951
I didn't do anything!

198
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,797
Cease fire!

199
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,230
Ward, God damn it, cease fire!

200
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,392
I think we hit him.
Let's get down there. Move

201
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,716
Sheriff to base, come in.

202
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,235
Go ahead, Will?

203
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:07,118
Lester, we're down in the gorge. Galt's dead alright.
Where the hell is that god damned chopper?

204
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,472
He won't come, Will. Says there's a storm heading your way.

205
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,674
I don't give a god damned what's on its way.
I want the chopper back here right now!

206
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,998
I don't want Galt's body out here all night.

207
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,113
You sure picked one hell of a guy to mess around with.

208
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,393
Just came over the Teletype a few minutes ago.
John Rambo is a Vietnam vet,

209
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,515
A Green Beret, Congressional medal of honor.
Guy's a war hero.

210
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,555
- Jesus, that freak?
- I knew there was something about that guy!

211
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,590
I double checked it, Will.
What do you want me to do?

212
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,631
I want you to do what told you to do.
Dod damn it. Get that chopper back here now, out.

213
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,354
A Green Beret!

214
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,393
War hero!

215
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,157
- That's great! That's just great!
- Shut your mouth!

216
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,310
What the hell's the matter with you guys?
He's one man... wounded.

217
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,557
Those Green Berets... they're real bad asses.

218
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,592
Why don't you let the State Police handle this?

219
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,989
Look at him! Goddammit!

220
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,475
Look. Look at him!
That's Art Galt, boy!

221
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,555
He and I were friends when your momma
was still wiping your nose!

222
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,471
Now he's dead. Because of that psycho out there!
Now you listen good:

223
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,313
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch and I'm gonna pin
that Congressional medal of honor to his liver.

224
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,958
And I'm gonna do it with you or without you.

225
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,594
We're closin' in, the scent's getting
stronger. - Keep your eyes open.

226
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,912
It's going to storm, that's all we need now!
Will, let's get out of here before it gets dark.

227
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,035
What's the matter, you afraid of the boogie man?
You god damned pansy.

228
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,392
Put your gun down, I'll show you who the pansy is.

229
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,239
Knock it off! Ward, move out! The fight is out here!
He's out there waiting for you.

230
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,069
Mitch, get on your feet and move!

231
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,793
Go find this guy for Chrissakes!
Keep your eyes open!

232
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,357
See you later, Ward!
- Shut up, Mitch.

233
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,915
There he is!

234
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,279
Let them dogs loose, Orval!

235
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,029
Go get em sweethearts!
There's your dinner!

236
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,913
Cease fire!

237
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,874
Goddammit I'm hit!

238
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,233
Jesus, he's got a gun.

239
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,793
That's not him, it's a God damned scarecrow.

240
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,557
No scarecrow that shot Orville, he's close.

241
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,470
Kill him! Go get him!

242
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,036
Go get him, Maggie!

243
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,034
Mitch, Ward, come here!
Shingleton, you cover us.

244
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,189
Look at his leg! - Mitch, get your belt. Make a
tourniquet around that.

245
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,269
We got to get this guy to a doctor.
- Get your belt on that fast! Where's the first-aid kit?

246
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,510
I left it in the car. Shit! Where did he
get that gun? - It's Galt's gun.

247
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:07,239
He's out of ammo.. - How do you know that?
- Because whatever killed that dog was no bullet.

248
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,833
Orval, listen. You have to stay awake.

249
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,308
You have to release the tourniquet every 15 minutes.
We got to get him. He's out of ammo.

250
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,869
He had no right to shoot my babies.
Get the son of a bitch!

251
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,594
OK, listen up.

252
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,193
We're right on top of him. We're going to form
a skirmish line, 50 feet apart.

253
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,279
Keep moving, there's no way out of here, except through us.

254
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,395
OK, let's do some huntin'.

255
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,555
Huntin'?
We ain't huntin' him, he's huntin' us!

256
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,710
Spread out, dammit!
I said 50 feet!

257
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,473
I hate this!

258
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,189
Will, it's Mitch!

259
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,318
Who is it?

260
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,553
What's up here?
- Shut up!

261
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,317
He's got Ward.
Spread out, I'll go this way.

262
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,719
Who's firing?

263
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,952
Who's firing there?
- I got him!

264
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,231
Shingleton, follow me!

265
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,674
I got him!

266
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,512
Help me!

267
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,678
Help me, Will!

268
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,589
Balford? Where the hell are you?

269
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,398
Shingleton, over here!

270
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,835
Easy now.
- Get me out of here!

271
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,639
Shingleton, where the hell are you?

272
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,399
I could have killed them all.
I could have killed you.

273
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,718
In town you're the law, out here, it's me.

274
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,878
Don't push it.

275
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,029
Don't push it, or I'll give you a war
you won't believe.

276
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,832
Let it go.

277
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,716
Let it go.

278
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,912
Move back.

279
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,269
How bad is the situation? Captain...

280
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,156
That's the only good thing about this business,
is the business you're doing in town.

281
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,398
Reporters are drinking the place dry.

282
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:29,150
You look like you're ready to keel over, Will.
Why don't you go home. It's my problem now.

283
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,720
Your problem? Listen Dave, don't give me any of your horsehit
about jurisdiction in this one, you understand?

284
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,596
- Would you like me to step outside?
- Finish up what you're doing.

285
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,635
Somewhere in this rugged mountain countryside,
possibly above the snow line,

286
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,470
shrouded in mist,
the fugitive, John Rambo, is hiding.

287
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,710
Units of the state police along with local members
of the national guard are now being mobilized.

288
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,870
What still remains unexplained by the local authorities
is just how and where the former green beret
came into possession of the weapons

289
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,949
former Green Beret got the weapons
with which he allegedly killed one deputy sheriff

290
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,349
and tried to kill 6 others. Only their skilled training
in police enforcement techniques saved their lives.

291
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,839
And word now is that the fugitive will be
in custody an a matter of hours.

292
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,389
Maps Will.

293
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,554
Will, there's something you ought to know.

294
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,509
Talk to you later, OK?

295
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,758
What is it, Lester? Spit it out!

296
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,148
I was just talking to Mitch.

297
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,276
and he was saying that Galt and a couple
of deputies were a little hard on the guy.

298
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,233
Assholes!

299
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,351
Doesn't make one god dammed bit of difference.
Dave, and you know it!

300
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,079
If one of my deputies gets out of line with a
prisoner then the prisoner comes to me with it!

301
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,353
And if I find out it's like he says,
I kick the deputy's ass!

302
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,439
Me, the law!
And that's the way it's gotta be.

303
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,233
People start fucking around with
the law and all hell breaks loose.

304
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:03,272
- Whatever possessed God in heaven to make a man like Rambo?
- God didn't make Rambo,

305
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,039
I made him.

306
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,515
Who the hell are you?

307
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,032
Sam Trautman. Colonel Samuel Trautman.

308
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,676
We're a little busy this morning, colonel,
what can we do for you?

309
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,156
- I've come to get my boy.
- Your boy?

310
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,957
I recruited him, I trained him,
I commanded him in Vietnam for 3 years.

311
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,594
I'd say that makes him mine.

312
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,909
I wonder why the Pentagon would send
a full bird a colonel to handle this?

313
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,157
The army thought I might be able to help.

314
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,149
I don't know in what way. Rambo's
a civilian now, he's my problem.

315
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,677
I don't think you understand.
I didn't come here to rescue Rambo from you.

316
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,997
I came to rescue you from him.

317
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,756
Well, we all appreciate your concern, Colonel.
We'll try to be extra careful.

318
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,753
- I'm just amazed he allowed any of your posse to live.
- Is that right?

319
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,397
Strictly speaking, he slipped up.
You're lucky to be breathing.

320
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:01,517
Great! Colonel, you came out here to find out
why one of your machines blew a gasket.

321
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,551
You don't want to except the fact that you're
dealing with an expert in guerilla warfare.

322
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,437
With a man who's the best. With guns,
with knives, with his bare hands.

323
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,998
An man who was trained to
ignore pain, ignore weather,

324
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,433
To live off the land... to eat things
that would make a billy goat puke.

325
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:26,273
In Vietnam, his job was to dispose of
enemy personnel, to kill... period.

326
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,633
Win by attrition.
Well, Rambo was the best!

327
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,600
OK, Colonel, now you've got us all scared to death, what do you
and the special forces think

328
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,476
we do with the psycho out there?
- Let him go.

329
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,070
- Do what?
- For now.

330
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:41,548
Defuse the whole situation, defuse him.
Provide a little gap and let him slip through it.

331
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,551
In a couple of weeks you'll pick him up in Seattle or someplace,
working in a car wash.

332
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,353
There'll be no fight and nobody else will get hurt.

333
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,193
I do my own work. I don't figure the best way to do that is
to close my eyes and hope he gets picked up in Seattle!

334
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,596
If you send your people in there after him, they'll get killed.

335
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:03,275
We're just a small hick town sheriff's department,
colonel, but we're expected to do our duty
just like our heroes in the special forces.

336
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,236
- In Special Forces, we teach our people
to stay alive in the line of duty.
- No shit, I never thought of that!

337
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:13,913
- You want a war that you can't win?
- You telling me that 200 men against your boy
is a no win situation for us?

338
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:19,514
You send that many, don't forget one thing.
- What? - A good supply of body-bags!

339
00:46:22,215 --> 00:46:23,215
Trautman...

340
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,800
I don't know which side you're on, Trautman,
I still think you came out here just to cover your ass.

341
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,836
But if you're serious about taking Rambo clean, follow me.

342
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,912
State police calling John Rambo.
Acknowledge.

343
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,791
State police calling John Rambo.
Come in please. Acknowledge!

344
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,715
If you're listening, Rambo, here's
your situation: you are surrounded,

345
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,075
Every possible exit has been blocked,
every highway, every road, every fire break.

346
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:25,389
You have our word that your services
to your country will be taken into consideration.
And you'll receive fair treatment.

347
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:30,391
- Just respond, we can work everything out... over
- Anything?

348
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,072
- He took a radio off one of my deputies.
- Then he has to be listening.

349
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,196
If I was in his position, I would try to pick up
some information. Maybe catch some cross talk.
- Of course he's listening!

350
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,589
- He's not going to break radio silence.
- No, not for us, but he might do it for you, Colonel.

351
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,714
He's your boy, isn't he?

352
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,397
maybe you can talk him into sparing
all our lives by giving himself up.

353
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,989
I can try.

354
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,275
At least we'd get a radio fix on his position
if you don't mind setting him up for us.

355
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,917
Setting him up for you?
That's like bringing the pigeons to the cat.

356
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,592
- Thanks for bringing your people out.
- Any time, Will.

357
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,556
Come on, Bobby, put the magazine away and pay attention.
We may only get one crack at this.

358
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,035
Company leader calling Raven.
Come on Raven.

359
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,389
Company leader calling Raven.

360
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,832
Company leader to Raven,
talk to me, Johnny.

361
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,189
Company leader to identify Baker Team:

362
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:43,918
Rambo, Messner, Ortega, Coletta,

363
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:49,229
Jorgensen, Danforth, Berry, Krakauer.

364
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,795
Confirm.

365
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,311
This is Colonel Trautman.

366
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,837
Talk to me, Johnny.

367
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,552
They're all gone, Sir.

368
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,754
- That's him, get on it.
- Rambo. Are you alright? Over.

369
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,509
Baker team, they're all dead, sir.

370
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,793
Not Delmare Berry, he made it.

371
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,196
Berry's gone too, sir.

372
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,995
How?

373
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,436
Got himself killed in 'Nam...
Didn't even know it. Cancer ate him down to the bone.

374
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,757
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

375
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,638
I'm the last one, sir.

376
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,074
It's good to hear your voice, Johnny,
it's been a long time.

377
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:48,069
Look, John, you've done some damage here, but they
don't want any more trouble. - He's North-west.

378
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,308
That's why I've come.
I'm gonna come in and fly you the hell out.

379
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,594
Just you and me. We'll work this out together.
Is that fair enough?

380
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,393
- Where'd you come from, Sir?
- Bragg.

381
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,912
I tried to get in touch with you but the guys
at Bragg never knew where to find you.

382
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:10,195
Well, I haven't been spending much time there lately,
they've got me down in DC. I'm shining a seat with my ass.

383
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,951
I wish I was back in Bragg now.

384
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,997
- We'll talk about that when you come in.
- I can't do that, Sir.

385
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,475
Well, look, John, we can't have you running around
out there wasting friendlies and civilians.

386
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,595
- There are no friendly civilians.
- I'm your friend, Johnny.

387
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:34,989
I was there with you, knee deep in blood and guts.
I covered your ass more than once.

388
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,752
Seems like bailing you out of trouble
is becoming a life long job for me.

389
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,589
There wouldn't be any trouble
if it wasn't for that king shit cop.

390
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,834
All I wanted was something to eat.

391
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,637
- But the man kept pushing sir.
- You did some pushing on your own, John.

392
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,951
They drew first blood, not me.

393
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,879
Let me come in and get you the hell out of there.

394
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,235
They drew first blood.

395
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,872
Rambo, are you still reading me?

396
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,592
Company leader to Raven!

397
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,393
Rambo, acknowledge!

398
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,431
He's finished, Colonel

399
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,511
We've got a real good fix on him though. Come first light,
I'm gonna put every man I got up on that ridge.

400
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,833
Then we'll get him my way.

401
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,834
Dammit.

402
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,829
God dammit!

403
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,232
Come on move it!

404
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,631
Does this guy got a gun?

405
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,639
There's the guy the cops are shootin' at.
- I see him! - I'll get him.

406
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,399
Don't shoot!

407
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,038
This way! Let's go!

408
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,956
There he is! Come on!

409
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,792
Now we got him!

410
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:50,475
Yes, I know exactly where it is.
Now listen to me very carefully!
Surround the area with every man you got, but don't move in.

411
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:57,109
Don't do anything till I get there!
And no shooting! I don't want him dead, I want him alive!

412
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,639
Keep firing!

413
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,791
Go on, guys, shoot!

414
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,359
Come on!

415
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,792
You guys are great!

416
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,472
Steve. I want you and Bruce, head around
these trees go to the front of that mine.

417
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,992
Screw that, Clinton, I ain't goin up there!
- No way!

418
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:42,232
Brandon, I want you to go into that mine.
- Not me.

419
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:48,478
What do you mean, not me?
- I do this part time, I didn't come here to get killed.
He's probably waiting for us.

420
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,115
What's wrong with you, Clinton?

421
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,713
Rambo?
This is Lieutenant Clinton Morgan.

422
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,074
National Guard leader.

423
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:06,957
I'm giving you just 3 zero seconds
to come on out.

424
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,508
Who's got the rocket launcher?
- I do. - Come here, Earl.

425
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,039
Rambo. This is your last chance to come out!

426
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,036
Maybe we should wait.

427
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,156
Earl, this creep is a killer! Besides,
I'm in charge and I say we blow it up.

428
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,752
Now fire that thing!
Just let me get out of the way first.

429
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,030
Give that man a cigar!

430
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,555
Bull's eye!

431
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,832
- Where the hell are they?
- Up the hill about 500 yards.

432
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,270
Move in a little closer just like Iwa Jima.

433
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,674
I don't believe it! Idiots!

434
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,870
One more for "Soldier of Fortune"!

435
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:58,038
What the hell do you think this is... some kind of circus?
Get the hell out of here!

436
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,634
Clinton, Jesus! Didn't you get the word, Clinton,
I told you people to wait until I got up here.

437
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,914
Well, he was shooting at us, Will!
I wasn't taking any chances.

438
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,396
What a mess.

439
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,838
We have to dig his body out of there right away.

440
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,670
You can't get a dozer up here,
you have to find somebody to dig him out.

441
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:25,432
- lt's your mess, Clinton! You clean it up.
- Will, come on... I gotta be back at the drug store tomorrow.

442
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,758
You'd better get started right away, Clinton!

443
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,630
Buried in a hole by a bunch of
God damned weekend warriors!

444
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,798
Thought you said he was the best you ever trained.

445
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,717
However he may have ended up, there
was a time when he was very special.

446
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:29,756
'Special' my ass. He's just another drifter that broke the law.
- Vagrancy, wasn't it?

447
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,512
That's gonna look real great on his gravestone
in Arlington: ''Here lies John Rambo,

448
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,678
winner of the Congressional medal of honor.

449
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,998
Survivor of countless incursions behind enemy lines,

450
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,833
killed for vagrancy in Jerkwater, USA''

451
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:49,991
Don't give me any of that crap, Trautman!
You think Rambo was the only guy
who had a tough time in Vietnam.

452
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,752
- He killed a police officer for Christ sake!
- You're god damned lucky he didn't kill all of you.

453
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:17,390
This character! He comes waltzing in here
full of all kinds of good advice.
I wish we'd let that god damned maniac go loose...

454
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:22,630
so we could save our own asses!
Well, we saved our asses, Colonel.
And we didn't let him go loose.

455
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:27,039
The best man lost!
And he doesn't like it!

456
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,831
- How are you doin', Will?
- Hold my calls.

457
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,799
Have a seat.

458
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:31,195
Miss, can you do this again, please.
- Sure. - And for my friend...?

459
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:34,074
A shot of wild turkey.

460
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:40,316
If I was out of line before,
I just want to apologize.

461
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,998
None of that makes much difference now, does it?

462
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,631
No, I guess not.

463
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,994
I suppose...

464
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,030
I just feel...

465
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:00,190
Like you were cheated out of your chance?

466
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,274
I wanted to kill that kid.

467
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,678
I wanted to kill him so bad, I could taste it.

468
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,831
Doesn't sit well with that badge.

469
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,348
It can get confusing sometimes.

470
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:20,633
In Vietnam you can bet that Rambo and I got pretty confused.
But we had orders.

471
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,429
When in doubt, kill.

472
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:32,812
But what the hell, you're a civilian. You can go home
to your wife, your house and flower garden.

473
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,218
You're under no pressure to figure all this out.

474
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:41,429
What about you colonel,
what did you figure out from all of this?
What would you have done with him if he came in?

475
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,758
Would you wrap your arms around him
give him a big sloppy kiss?

476
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,555
Or would you have blown his brains out?

477
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,952
I couldn't answer that until I met him face to face.

478
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,158
Well, there it is.

479
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,250
Just as well we never got a chance to find out.

480
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,589
Drive!

481
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:01,830
Don't look at me, look at the road.
That's how accidents happen.

482
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,118
What's your name?
- Cathcart, Robert A.

483
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:10,155
- What do you got in the back, Robert A.?
- M16s

484
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,957
OK, Robert A., get out of the truck.
- I don't got no beef with you.
- Go home!

485
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,395
Want to turn that up?

486
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,589
What's your story, Steamboat?

487
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:56,797
Looks like somebody pulled the plug too soon.
That Rambo guy? He's on the loose again.

488
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,398
Hey Will, it's Rambo! He's still around

489
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,109
- Holy fuck!
- Get out there right away. Move!

490
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,791
What the hell's going on?

491
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,472
Watch yourselves!
- They're all gonna blow!

492
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,030
Attention, all civilians!

493
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,714
For your own safety
please evacuate the streets immediately.

494
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:32,879
Remain indoors until you receive further instructions. I repeat:

495
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:37,233
This is a police emergency.
Please evacuate the streets immediately.

496
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,871
They found Rambo's body.

497
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:01,871
lt stole a truck and blew up a gas
station on the other side of town.

498
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,799
The kid is resilient.

499
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:11,398
Why don't you forget what you're thinking
and clear out while you can.
- Get the fuck out of here Trautman
and take your advice with you.

500
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,750
When I talked to earlier,
you knew he was still alive, didn't you?

501
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,029
I suspected it.

502
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,798
Sure, that's why you stuck around.
You trained him.

503
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:27,471
You taught him how to get out of places like that cave.

504
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,797
But he's not going to get out of this place.

505
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:34,791
Teasle, you and all your men couldn't handle him before,
what makes you think you can handle him now?

506
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,675
Because God knows what damage he's prepared to do.

507
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,199
You're going to die, Teasle.

508
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,592
Everybody dies!

509
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,752
There's only one man in this room that has a half a chance.
That's not because I'm better than he is.

510
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,633
But it's because he trusts me.

511
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:04,392
See, I'm the closest thing to family that he has left,
and that may be all the edge I need.

512
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,796
Jesus Christ, where do you people come from?

513
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,559
This is my job, Trautman,
this is my town!

514
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,475
I'm not giving it up to you,
or to Rambo or anybody else!

515
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,911
You just stay the hell out of my way!

516
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,632
- Get a little closer!
- I can't...

517
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,672
It's too God damned hot!

518
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:38,316
Will, it's Lester, do you copy, over?

519
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:43,271
Come on, let's go!
Will, this is Lester, do you copy, over?

520
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:48,591
We've got some serious problems.
The highway's been cut off.

521
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,157
The truck's out here,
but we couldn't find the body.

522
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:56,149
I repeat, no body, lt's totally burnt out.
Preston, get those people out of here...

523
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,112
Move them back to the south side.

524
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:05,190
We don't know how many gas tanks
there are under the pumps...

525
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:45,233
Go ahead, go ahead!

526
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:49,032
- Go ahead you crazy son of a bitch!
- Rambo!

527
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,439
Rambo, don't do it!

528
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,554
Listen to me, Rambo!

529
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,911
You have no chance.

530
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,032
Drop your weapon.

531
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,030
We're going to order a chopper in
and fly you back to Bragg.

532
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,389
Hold your fire!

533
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:10,710
- Yeah?
- Hold your fire!

534
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,114
Think about what you're doing.

535
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,351
The building's perimeter's covered.
No exits.

536
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,599
There's nearly 200 men out there and a lot of M16s!

537
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:26,349
You did everything to make this private war happen.

538
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:31,592
You've done enough damage!
This mission is over, you understand me?

539
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:34,832
This mission is over!

540
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,035
Look at them out there.

541
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,115
Look at them!

542
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,833
If you don't end this now,
they're going to kill you.

543
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,759
Is that what you want?

544
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,520
lt's over, Johnny. lt's over!

545
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:01,636
Nothing is over! Nothing!
You just don't turn it off!

546
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:05,629
lt wasn't my war.
You asked me, I didn't ask you!

547
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,231
I did everything I had to do to win,
but someone wouldn't let us win.

548
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:14,071
Then I come back to the world and I see all those
maggots at the airport protesting me, spitting.

549
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:18,433
Calling me baby killer and all that vile crap!

550
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:24,079
Who are they to protest me? Who are they?
Unless they've been me and been there and know
what the hell they're yelling about?

551
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,592
It was a bad time for everyone, Rambo,
it's all in the past now.

552
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:32,511
For you! For me, civilian life is nothing.
In the field, we had a code of honor.

553
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,952
You watch my back, I watch yours.
Back here, there's nothing!

554
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,631
You're the last of an elite group,
don't end it like this.

555
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:44,278
Back there I can fly a gun ship, I can drive a tank,
I was in charge of a million dollar equipment.

556
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:47,712
Back here I can't even hold a job parking cars!

557
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,151
Where is everybody?

558
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,596
I had a friend who was there for us.

559
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:12,632
There were all these guys, man.
Back there were all these fuckin guys!

560
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,115
who were my friends!

561
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:18,952
back here there's nothing!
Remember Dan Forest?

562
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:23,359
Wore this black headband.
I took one of his magic markers, and I said "if found...

563
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:27,793
mail this to Las Vegas",
because we were always talking about Vegas.

564
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:33,872
And this fucking car. this fucking 58 Chevy convertible
he was talking about his car
he said he would cruise till the tires fell off.

565
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:47,233
In one of these barns a kid came up
this kid carrying a shoe shine box.

566
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:48,749
"Shine please, shine?"

567
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,832
He kept on asking. Joe said ya.

568
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:58,630
I went to get a couple of beers.
And the box was wired. He opened up the box...

569
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,548
Fucking blew his body all over the place.

570
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,788
He's laying there and he's fucking screaming...
there's pieces of him all over me!

571
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:10,358
And I'm trying to pull them off, you know...
my friend! it's all over me!

572
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,156
I got blood and everything and...
I'm trying to hold him together, I put him together

573
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,477
the fucking entrails keep coming out!

574
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,672
And nobody would help!

575
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:23,033
They only go "I want to go home!"
just calling my name.

576
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:26,074
"I want to go home, Johnny!
I want to drive my Chevy!

577
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,317
But I couldn't find his legs.

578
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,719
"I can't find your legs!"

579
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:36,597
I can't get it out of my head.
It was seven years.

580
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,519
Every day it hurts.

581
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:43,829
Sometimes I wake up and don't know
where I am. I don't talk to anybody.

582
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,191
Sometimes a day.

583
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,632
Sometimes a week.

584
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,314
I can't put it out of my mind.
