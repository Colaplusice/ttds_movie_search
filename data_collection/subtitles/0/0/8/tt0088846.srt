00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,805
~ Brazil~

2
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:46,868
~ Where hearts
were entertained in June ~

3
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,008
~ We stood beneath
an amber moon ~

4
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:56,020
~ And softly murmured
someday soon ~

5
00:00:56,122 --> 00:01:00,889
- ~ Someday ~
- ~ We'd kiss ~

6
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,986
~ We'd kiss ~~

7
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,124
~ Central Services ~

8
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,725
~ We do the work
You do the pleasure ~~

9
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:14,796
Hi there.
I want talk to you about ducts.

10
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:19,572
Do your ducts seem old-fashioned,
out-of-date?.

11
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,671
Central Services's new duct designs...

12
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:26,013
are now available
in hundreds of different colors...

13
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,986
to suit your individual taste.

14
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:34,857
Hurry now, while stocks last,
to your nearest Central Services showroom.

15
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,761
Designer colors to suit
your demanding taste.

16
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:02,244
Tonight we have with us,
from the Ministry of Information...

17
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:05,017
Deputy Minister Eugene Helpmann.

18
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,025
Good evening, David.

19
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:11,461
What do you believe is behind
this recent increase in terrorist bombings?.

20
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,930
Bad sportsmanship.

21
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,263
A ruthless minority of people...

22
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:20,499
seems to have forgotten certain
good old-fashioned virtues.

23
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,838
They just can't stand
seeing the other fella win.

24
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,468
If these people
would just play the game...

25
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,638
they'd get a lot more out of life.

26
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,546
Nevertheless, Mr. Helpmann,
there are those who maintain...

27
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,984
that the Ministry of Information
has become too large and unwieldy.

28
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:38,285
David, in a free society,
information's the name of the game.

29
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,155
You can't win the game
ifyou're a man short.

30
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:45,595
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister.
Seven percent of the gross national product.

31
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,929
I understand this concern
on behalf of the taxpayer.

32
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,935
People want value for money.

33
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:56,407
That's why we always insist on the principle
of information retrieval charges.

34
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,603
- It's absolutely right and fair...

35
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,943
that those found guilty should pay
for their periods of detention...

36
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,543
and for the information retrieval
procedures used in their interrogation.

37
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,580
Do you bel ieve that the government
is winning the battle against terrorists?.

38
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,491
Oh, yes. Our morale
is m uch higher than theirs.

39
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,462
We're fielding all theirstrokes,
running a lot ofthem out...

40
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,432
and pretty consistently
knocking them for six.

41
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,195
I'd say they're nearly out ofthe game.

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,646
Iaw-abiding citizens
to have to subsidize criminals?.

43
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,982
But, Mr. Helpmann, the bombing campaign
is now in its 1 3th year.

44
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,318
Beginner's luck.

45
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,292
Thank you very much,
Deputy Minister.

46
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,394
Thank you, David.

47
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,259
And a very merry Christmas
to you all.

48
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,858
"Scrooge was better than his word."

49
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,098
"He did it all, and infinitely more."

50
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:03,232
- "And to Tiny Tim, who did not die..."

51
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,335
" he became a second father."

52
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:10,849
" He became as good a friend
in the good old world."

53
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,249
"And so, as Tiny Tim observed..."

54
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,687
"God bless us, every one."

55
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,494
- Are you boys giving me the runaround?.
- Where are you?.

56
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,793
- Step right up. This way. Hey, hey, hey, hey!.

57
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,958
Don't throw that.
That's only for long distance.

58
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,968
- All right.

59
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,800
- I'm sorry, boys, but we haven't got any vacancies.
- Got no vacancies.

60
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,431
- We got plenty of rooms.
- That's all right. We take a room.

61
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,476
- All right.
- All right. We take a vacancy.

62
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,206
- Boy, take the gentlemen's baggage.

63
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,983
- Who's there?

64
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,956
Who is that?.

65
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,019
Father Christmas can't come
ifwe haven't got a chimney.

66
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,531
- You'll see.

67
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,745
No!

68
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,753
- What's going on?

69
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,019
No!

70
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:52,149
I hereby inform you,
under powers entrusted to me...

71
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:56,551
under section 47, paragraph 7
of council order number 438476...

72
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,490
- that Mr. Buttle, Archibald, residing at
41 2 North Tower, Shangrila Towers...

73
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,562
has been invited to assist the Ministry
of Information with certain inquiries...

74
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,223
and that he is liable to
certain financial obligations...

75
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:11,531
as specified in council order
RB/CZ/907 /X.

76
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,537
- Sign here, please.

77
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,442
Where are you taking him?.

78
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,206
There.

79
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,613
Thankyou.
Same again, please.

80
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,777
J ust there.
Press harder his time.

81
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,254
- Good.
- What is this all about?.

82
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,918
That is your receipt for your husband.
Thankyou.

83
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,154
And this is my receipt for your receipt.

84
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,458
Mrs. Buttle, are you okay?

85
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,067
- Ho!. Ho!.
- We're Department of Works!

86
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,004
Department of Works up here!

87
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,166
Careful with those bloody things.

88
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,278
Don't take any notice of them, love.

89
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,745
Don't touch me.
Why don't you just get the hell out of here.

90
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,783
Don't you worry, love.
We'l I have everything shipshape in a jiffy.

91
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:03,151
- That's it. Nothing to worry about.
- Right. It's Tuttle downstairs who can worry, eh?.

92
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,487
Tuttle?. His name's Buttle.
There must be some mistake.

93
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,493
Mistake?. 
We don't make mistakes.

94
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,995
- That's bloody typical.

95
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,591
They've gone back to metric
without telling us.

96
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,034
Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?.

97
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,106
Yeah. Uh, uh -

98
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,465
" Buttle."

99
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,836
Buttle, Archibald.

100
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,303
Ridiculous name.

101
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,804
On the twenty -

102
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,347
Oh, shit.

103
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,349
- Mr. -

104
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,250
Mr. Lowry, would you
step in here, please?.

105
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,156
Ah.

106
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,294
I say, h-has anybody seen Lowry?.

107
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:03,828
Has anybody seen Sam Lowry?.

108
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,699
Sam.

109
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,481
Sam.

110
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,042
- Hello.
- Hello? Sam. Where are you?.

111
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,307
- Hello?.
- It's 11:00.

112
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,542
- What?.
-11:00!

113
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,982
- Mr. Kurtzmann.
- Yes.

114
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,680
You're up late.

115
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,019
- It's 11:00.
- Is it?.

116
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:39,022
- Oh. The electrics here are up the spout.

117
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,429
- I know. Look -
- Oh, yours too?.

118
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,970
- Yes.
- Oh, well, um, I'll be there as soon as I can.

119
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,971
- Yes. Thanks. Bye.
- Hurry up.

120
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,116
- Hello, Sammy.

121
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,555
What have you got to say?.

122
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,612
Oh, very good, Sammy.

123
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,124
...famous statue
pairing truth and freedom.

124
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,170
This is not the only statue -
Shut up!

125
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,796
What's this gun for?

126
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:58,434
This one, Sister,
is a nine-milimeter submachine gun...

127
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,842
used for close-quarter combat fighting.

128
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,210
Very effective weapon.
Wouldyou like to see it?

129
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,989
- Oh.

130
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,724
Ooh!

131
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,047
Sam!

132
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,573
Jack!

133
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,347
- WelI -
- Long time no see.

134
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,979
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?.

135
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,820
I don't expect to see you
slumming it in Records.

136
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:51,488
- What's the problem?.
- Problem?. No problem.
Everything's fine. Wonderful. Marvelous.

137
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,656
Alison's in great shape.
Kids are fine.

138
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:57,327
I'm on Security Level 5 now,
so Mr. Helpmann relies on me more and more.

139
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,064
- I t's been a great year.
- You sound worried.

140
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,198
Worried?. Me?.
If I' m worried about anyone, Sam, it's you.

141
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,608
I mean, look at you, Sam.
Whatever happened to you?

142
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,509
Records?

143
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,377
Sam, you were one of the brightest

144
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,292
Sam?

145
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,394
Uh, Jack, it's great to see you.

146
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,625
- I 'm gonna be late.
- Sam.

147
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,567
Let a friend telI you.
Your Iife is going wrong.

148
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,605
Records is a dead-end department.
No security level worth a damn.

149
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,073
- It's impossible to get noticed.
- I know.

150
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,736
Wonderful. Marvelous.

151
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,075
Perfect. See you, Jack.

152
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,911
- Give my regards to Alison and the twins.
- Triplets.

153
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,453
Triplets? God.
How time flies.

154
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:54,324
A very clear delineation of picture this has.
Adamant, mobile.

155
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,394
Next.

156
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,731
I want to report a wrongful arrest.

157
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,066
You want Information Adjustments.
Different department.

158
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,072
I 've been to Information Adjustments.

159
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:12,268
They sent me here. They said
you have a form I need to fill out.

160
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,573
Have you got an arrest receipt?.

161
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,444
Yeah.

162
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:21,144
- Is it stamped?
- Stamped?

163
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,215
No, no.
There's no stamp on it, you see.

164
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,556
I can't let you have the form
until this is stamped.

165
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,996
- Where do I get it stamped?.
- Information Adjustments.

166
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,541
It's nothing. It's nothing.

167
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,609
It keeps picking up old films.

168
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,777
That can't be right, can it?.

169
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,946
Perhaps the machine's on the blink.

170
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:00,457
No, it's not the machine. There's a mismatch
on the personnel code numbers.

171
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,223
Tuttle should have had $31.06 debited
against his account, not Buttle.

172
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:08,459
- My God! A mistake!
- Well, at least it's not ours.

173
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,535
Isn't it?. Whose is it?.

174
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,298
- Information Retrieval.
- Oh, good.

175
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,965
Yeah. See, Expediting has put in
for electrical procedures...

176
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,636
in respect of Buttle, Archibald,
shoe repair operative...

177
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:23,875
but Security has invoiced Admin
for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer.

178
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,508
Oh, what a relief.
Finish your tea, Sam.

179
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:29,109
What?. Oh. Thanks.

180
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,686
I don't know what I would do
ifyou ever got promoted.

181
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:37,250
- Oh, God, don't worry about that.
- No, but if they did promote you, uh -

182
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,665
I've told you before.
I'd turn it down.

183
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,701
- Would you?. Really?.
- Really.

184
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,270
You've been promoted.

185
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,502
It's your mother, isn't it?.
Pulling strings again.

186
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:02,949
Sam, it's time foryou
to grow up and accept responsibility.

187
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:07,685
Your poor father would be appalled
at your lack of promotion. Ooh!

188
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:11,388
Mother, I just wish
you would stop interfering.

189
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,762
I don't want promotion.
I'm happy where I am.

190
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,268
No, you're not.
Jack Lint is a lesson to you.

191
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,498
He doesn't have your brains,
but he's got the ambition.

192
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,598
You haven't got the ambition.

193
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,576
Luckily,you've got me
and the deputyminister.

194
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,841
- Mr. Helpmann was very close to your father.
- Now, please, Mrs. Lowry.

195
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,041
Don't get upset.

196
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,642
Mr. Lowry, please wait in reception.
You're giving her wrinkles.

197
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,653
- You see?
- God!

198
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,383
J ust try and relax, Mrs. Lowry.

199
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,391
I'll make you 20 years younger.

200
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:44,826
- Ha!
- Yoo-hoo, Dr.Jaffe. You are a genius.

201
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,455
Would you like to be surgeon general?.

202
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,000
I know simply everybody.

203
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,094
Well, they won't know you
when I've finished with you.

204
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,231
- Mmm.
- First...

205
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,502
we remove the excess derma.

206
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,510
- So.
- Mmm.

207
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:05,777
Now the flaccid tissues
under the eyes and the forehead.

208
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,613
- Zip.
- Oh.

209
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:12,854
Now, I lift...

210
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,256
the wrinkles and the worry lines...

211
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,851
right up into the wig,
into the hairline.

212
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,796
Now the template.

213
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,465
- Mercy.
- There. Now a bit of sticky.

214
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,472
Like so.

215
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:32,442
And already she's twice as beautiful
as she was before. Voila!

216
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,640
Mr. Helpmann was very close
to yourpoor father.

217
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,683
He was very close to me.

218
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,685
Still is.

219
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,713
He'll take you under his wing
when you get to Information Retrieval.

220
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,089
- Thank you, sir.
- You'll like it there.

221
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,321
You're not listening to me, Mother.

222
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,725
- What the hell is this, lady?

223
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:01,602
- I t's a present for my son. Really!

224
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:05,165
I hope you Iike it.
I t's very exclusive.

225
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,278
What on earth is it?.

226
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,339
Something for an executive.

227
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,045
- Ah, Madame Lowry.

228
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,851
You look exquisite today.
Merry Christmas.

229
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,391
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.

230
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,927
- Sorry.
- Uh, you remember my son, Samuel.

231
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,725
- Of course.
- We're joining Mrs. Terrain.

232
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,233
- Yes. The lady's waiting.
- Are we?. God.

233
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,363
This way.

234
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:37,567
Mother. Mother, I thought we were
going to be able to talk.

235
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,735
- We will. We will.
- Ida, Sam.

236
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,575
- Oh, God. She's got what's her name with her.
- Yoo-hoo!

237
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,911
Sam!

238
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:49,818
Well, Alma. How are you?.
You look wonderful.

239
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,686
Hello, Shirley.

240
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,282
Thankyou, Spiro.

241
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,487
- Salt?.
- Not yet.

242
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,962
Sam, happy Christmas.

243
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,965
Oh!

244
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,092
- So sorry we're late.
- Thanks.

245
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,637
Now, Alma...

246
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,706
what are you going to have?.

247
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,573
I can't make up my mind whether
to have the number one or the number two.

248
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:16,011
- What do you recommend, Spiro?.
- Between you and me, madame...

249
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,014
today the number two.

250
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:21,517
Thankyou, Spiro.
Shirley. Shirley, what are you going to have?.

251
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,852
Between you and me, mademoiselle,
today the number one.

252
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,826
- Madame Lowry?.
- Oh, to hell with the diet.

253
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,089
I'm going to have a number eight, please.

254
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:35,655
- A most perceptive choice if I dare say so, madame.
- Oh, Ida!

255
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,667
- Monsieur.
- Steak, please. Rare. Mother -

256
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,795
- Monsieur, quel numero?
- I don't know which number. Mother, please -

257
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,272
- That one. There.
- That's fine. Thanks.

258
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,105
- Mother, will you please listen to me.
- Alma! You wicked girl.

259
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,305
- You've started your treatment.
- Say the number, please.

260
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,713
- You noticed.
- You have to say the number!

261
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,582
- Will you please go away! I'm trying to talk -
- I must tell you all about it.

262
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,655
Number three.

263
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,858
Mother, will you listen to me.
I haven't -

264
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,086
Numero huit.

265
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:08,462
Braised veal in wine sauce.

266
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,467
- Ooh!
- Mmm!

267
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:15,666
It's too exciting.
I've left Dr.Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.

268
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,402
- Numero deux. Duck a I 'orange.
- Dr. Chapman?. Chapman?.

269
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,410
- Excusez-moi.

270
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,912
- The acid man?.

271
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:26,416
Really, Ida! Just because
his techniques are revolutionary...

272
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,749
I don't go around
calling Dr.Jaffe the knife man.

273
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,415
Numero un, crevettes a la mayonnaise.

274
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:36,358
- I am sorry, Alma. I didn't mean to sound so -
- It's all right, Ida. It's just -

275
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,397
Steak. Numero trois.

276
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,732
Mesdames, monsieur...

277
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,861
bon appetit.

278
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,167
- Merci.
- Merci.

279
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:53,608
Acid, on the other hand, can be used
for such wonderful ly subtle shading.

280
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,703
- Hmm.
- Such delicate nuances.

281
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,044
Like a Rembrandt etching.

282
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,584
- And it is so much quicker.
- God!

283
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:04,144
If it wasn't for this complication - the doctor says
it could have happened to anybody -

284
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,156
I'd have had this dressing offyesterday.

285
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,590
- Mm-hmm.
- Shirley.

286
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,525
Salt?.

287
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,086
What were we saying?.

288
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,487
- This isn't rare.
- Oh! By the by, Alma...

289
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:43,322
I saw the most wonderful idea
for Christmas presents at the chemist's.

290
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,261
Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.

291
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,265
Oh, that sounds marvelous!

292
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,803
It's good at any doctor's
and most of the major hospitals.

293
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:55,430
It's also accepted
for gynecological examinations...

294
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,940
- Including cesarean section.

295
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,773
- Spiro.
- I'm sorry, madame. I don't know what to say.

296
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,847
I t never real ly happens to us.

297
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,143
I'm going to do something
about it straightaway.

298
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,947
Really, Sam! Why can't you
do something about these terrorists?.

299
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,080
- It's my lunch hour.

300
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,249
Besides, it's not my department.

301
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,921
Actually, Alma, that was one of
the little things I 've been dying to tell you.

302
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:24,161
Look. Sam's been promoted
to Information Retrieval.

303
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:28,171
Oh, that's wonderful!
Congratulations, Sam!

304
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:32,004
Stop it! I'm not being promoted.
I'm not going to Information Retrieval.

305
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,739
If I want you to stickyour oar in, Mother,
I'll tell you where to stick it.

306
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,753
Pepper?.

307
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,288
I've gotta go.

308
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,188
- Sam, you haven't had your dessert.
- I don't want dessert.

309
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:51,694
- I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
- Of course you want something.

310
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,630
You must have hopes, wishes, dreams!

311
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,099
No, nothing. Not even dreams.

312
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,773
Sam.

313
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,747
Sam!

314
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,984
- Oh, God.

315
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:51,145
Hel lo. Central Services?.

316
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,309
I 'm at 579 B, Block 1 9,
Northwestern Section " D."

317
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,650
That's exit one on Green Pastures Highway
at the Orange Blossom Flyover.

318
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:01,248
And I've got trouble with my air-conditioning.
It's an emergency.

319
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,259
Thank you for calling Central Services.

320
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,261
I'm sorry.
Due to temporary staff shortage...

321
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:10,062
Central Services cannot take service calls
centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours.

322
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:13,763
- Have a nice day. This has not been a recording.
- This is an emergency.

323
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,170
Thank you for calling Central Services.
I'm sorry. Due to -

324
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:19,505
- No. I've got to have a heating engineer.
- Thankyou for calling Central Services.

325
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,511
Oh, shit.

326
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,037
Hello.

327
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,476

00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,116
- Hello.
- Hello.

330
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,460
Hello. Mr. Lowry.

331
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,530
Yes. Who is this?.

332
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,067
Put the phone down
and raise your hands.

333
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,135
What?. Who is this?.

334
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,608
Nice and easy now.

335
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,676
Nice and easy.

336
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:32,409
Just keep your hands
where I can see them.

337
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,874
What - What are you doing?.

338
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,312
Harry Tuttle.
Heating engineer at your service.

339
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,514
Tuttle?.

340
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,525
Are you from Central Services?.

341
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,400
I called Central Services.

342
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,935
Well, they're a little
overworked these days.

343
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,198
Luckily I intercepted your call.

344
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:31,070
You did -

345
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:35,442
Just a minute.
What was that business with the gun?

346
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,481
I t's just a precaution, sir.

347
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,482
J ust a precaution.

348
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:42,519
I 've had traps set for me before now.

349
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,111
And there are plenty of people
in Central Services...

350
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,384
who'd love to
get their hands on Harry Tuttle.

351
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,822
Are you telling me that this is illegal?.

352
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,203
Well, yes and no. Officially, only Central Service
operatives are supposed to touch this stuff.

353
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,207
- Would you hold this, please?.
- Uh -

354
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,607
But nowadays,
with all the new rules and regulations...

355
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,679
they can't get decent staff anymore.

356
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,681
So they tend to turn a blind eye
as long as I'm careful.

357
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:15,082
Mind you, if ever they could prove
that I've been working on their equipment...

358
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,416
Well, that's a pipe of a different color.

359
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:20,320
- Wouldn't it be simpler just to work -
- Would you hold this for me?.

360
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,861
Sorry. Yes. I was saying, wouldn't it be simpler
to work with Central Services?.

361
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,453
Nah! Nah. Couldn't stand the pa -

362
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,294
- We're getting warm.

363
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,767
- You couldn't what?. Couldn't stand the what?.
- Paperwork. Couldn't stand the paperwork.

364
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,238
Listen. This whole system ofyours
could be on fire...

365
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:40,505
and I couldn't even turn on a kitchen tap
without filling out a 27B/6.

366
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,308
Bloody paperwork.

367
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,609
I suppose one has to
expect a certain amount.

368
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,686
Why?. I came into this game
for the action, the excitement.

369
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:53,918
Go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out,
wherever there's trouble, a man alone.

370
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:57,961
Now they got the whole country sectioned off.
You can't make a move without a form.

371
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,579
Found it.

372
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,580
There's your problem.

373
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,616
- Can you fix it?.
- No, I can't.

374
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:23,414
But I can bypass it
with one of these.

375
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,658
Fine by me.

376
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,864
- Are you expecting anyone?.
- No.

377
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,767
- Get down!
- Wait! Wait! Will you wait!

378
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,775
Shh.

379
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:51,074
- The flashlight.
- Ah!

380
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,951
Central Services.

381
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,953
- Central Services.
- Oh, yes.

382
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,955
- You rang, sir?.
- You rang, sir?.

383
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,355
- Trouble with your air-conditioning?.
- Air-conditioning, sir?.

384
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,791
No, it's - it's - it's, uh, all right.

385
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,955
It's, um - It's fixed.

386
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:08,760
- Fixed.
- Fixed?.

387
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,767
Yes, um -

388
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,064
I mean, it, um, fixed itself.

389
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,731
- Oh, it fixed itself!.
- Fixed itself?

390
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,035
Yes!

391
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,042
Machines don't fix themselves.

392
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,339
No, they don't fix themselves, sir.

393
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,848
- He's tampered with it, Dowser.
- I think he's tampered with it, Mr. Spoor.

394
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,850
Sorryyou've had a wasted journey.

395
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,852
Oh, that's all right.

396
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,422
- I think we'll go have a little look.
- No,you can't.

397
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,787
I think we should.
Yes, Mr. Spoor.

398
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,225
Have you got a 27B/6?.

399
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,819
27B/6?.

400
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,831
- 27B/6?.

401
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,265
27-

402
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,171
Now look what you've done to him!

403
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:52,300
Well, have you got a 27B/6?.

404
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,174
Not... as such.

405
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,447
But we'll get one.

406
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,916
- It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
- It's all right, then?.

407
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,353
Sorry. I'm a bit of a stickler
for paperwork, you see.

408
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:08,516
I mean, where would we be
ifwe didn't stick to the correct procedures?.

409
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:11,026
We'll be back.

410
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,188
We'll be back!

411
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,797
- It's all right.

412
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:19,802
- Thanks for coming.

413
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,804
We'll be back,
you bloody little bastard!

414
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,431
- Thank you.
- We'll show you!

415
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,841
Well -

416
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,851
Thanks, Lowry.
You're a good man in a tight corner.

417
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,978
- Thanks.

418
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,249
Listen, um - I, uh -

419
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,955
Well, I -

420
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,361
I just happen to work
at the Ministry of Information.

421
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,956
- What?.
- And, uh -

422
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:54,630
Well, I just happen to know
that Information Retrieval...

423
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:58,368
are looking for an Archibald Tuttle,
heating engineer.

424
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,310
You, uh -

425
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,710
You wouldn't, by any chance -

426
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,510
Would you?.

427
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,515
My good friends call me Harry.

428
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,484
Information Retrieval, huh?.

429
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,923
The big boys.

430
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,598
What do they want you for?.

431
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,606
- Time to go.
- Sorry.

432
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:32,175
- How's that?

433
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:38,182
Listen, you, um -you really must
let me give you something.

434
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:47,121
How much will it be for the, uh -
for the work?

435
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,125
Ah, come on.

436
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:52,196
You did me a favor.
J ust check the corridor.

437
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,432
Oh. Well, thanks.

438
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,435
Listen, kid,
we're all in it together.

439
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,835
- Go on.
- Right.

440
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,143
Okay.

441
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,787
All clear.

442
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,476
I think Kurtzmann
is getting suspicious.

443
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,918
What's playing today?.

444
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,924
Casablanca.

445
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,995
Mr. Lowry, willyou step in here, please.

446
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:03,033
Lowry!

447
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,093
Sam Lowry!

448
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,213
Psst!

449
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,744
Thank God you're here.
We're in terrible trouble.

450
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,480
Shh.

451
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,958
- Look at this. Look at this.
- I t's a check.

452
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,964
I t's the refund for Tuttle.

453
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,966
- Tuttle?.
- Mm-hmm.

454
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,969
No, no. Buttle.
I mean Buttle.

455
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,266
It's been confusion
from the word go.

456
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:45,274
He's been overcharged for
Information Retrieval procedures...

457
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:48,277
and someone somewhere
is trying to make us carry the can.

458
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:51,815
Can I have a look?.
I 've never seen a refund check before.

459
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,884
I 'll bet it's Jeffries.

460
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,887
Yes.

461
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,890
He always believes that people should
pay more for their interrogation.

462
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,892
And " B," he loathes me.

463
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,894
We've gotta get rid of it!

464
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,896
Well, send it to somebody else.

465
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,899
Better still, send it to Buttle.
After all, it's his check.

466
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,401
I've tried that.
But look. Look at this.

467
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:16,462
You see?. The population census
has gotten him down as "dormanted."

468
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,975
Uh, the Central Collective Storehouse computer
has got him down as "deleted."

469
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,977
Hang on.

470
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,479
Information Retrieval
has got him down as "inoperative."

471
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,550
Security has got him down as "excised."

472
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,381
-Administration has him down as "completed. "
- He's dead.

473
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,478
Le -

474
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,557
Dead?.

475
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,757
Well, that's awful.

476
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,226
We'll never get rid
of the damn thing now.

477
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,566
What we gonna do, Sam?.

478
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,572
Could try next of kin.

479
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,574
Next of kin!

480
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:54,167
- Yes!

481
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,279
There we go.
Buttle. Veronica. Mrs.

482
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,284
Veronica?.

483
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,286
What's the number on the check?.

484
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:08,085
Uh, 27 1 56789...

485
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:14,426
/07 4328K.

486
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,869
Right. into memory.

487
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,272
Central Banking.

488
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,942
Veronica Buttle.

489
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,943
Mrs.

490
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,013
Deposit.

491
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,762
Thank God for that.

492
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,764
Uh, would you like some tea?.

493
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,538
There's a problem.
She doesn't have a bank account.

494
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,019
Well, that's it, then.

495
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,955
I might just as well
go and hang myself now.

496
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:20,488
This sort of thing could never have happened
before this stupid seventh-tier reorganization.

497
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:24,728
That's Simmons's doing. And he and Jeffries
always sit together at lunch.

498
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,530
Bastards!

499
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,605
Sh - Shh. Shh.

500
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:37,280
Perhaps we could lose the thing behind
a filing cabinet or something - burn it, eat it.

501
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,281
Look, there is one solution.

502
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,283
What?

503
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,683
Drive out to Mrs. Buttle,
let her sign the back of the check.

504
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,882
She can cash it
at the corner sweet shop.

505
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,959
That's brilliant, Sam.

506
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:51,961
I'll even do it foryou.

507
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,463
Here, authorize the check.
What's the address?.

508
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,032
Everything's in here.

509
00:38:57,201 --> 00:39:00,728
Uh, w-what should I do next?.

510
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:06,808
Pink and blue receipts.
Sign there, there and there.

511
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,038
- And sign the check there.
- Yes.

512
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,745
I think I've broken a bone.

513
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,754
Look, my wrist is all limp.

514
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,256
What a pathetic creature I am!

515
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,520
Here.

516
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,925
- I'll do it for you.

517
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,414
Right.

518
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,609
I'll be on my way.

519
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,948
Sam?

520
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,955
- Mm-hmm?.

521
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,651
You are good to me, you know.

522
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,821
- Here's looking at you, kid.
- Here's looking at you.

523
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:07,067
~ Brazil ~

524
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:12,234
~ Where hearts
were entertained in June ~

525
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:18,282
~ We stood beneath an amber moon ~

526
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:22,512
We interrupt this program to bring you news
ofa terrorist bombing at the Blue Lagoon -

527
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,226
~ And clung together ~

528
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:32,261
~ Then ~

529
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:36,197
~ Tomorrow was another day ~

530
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:42,204
- ~ The morning found me miles away ~

531
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:48,609
~ With still a million things to say ~

532
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,540
~ Now ~

533
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:57,587
~ When twilight dims the sky above ~

534
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,952
~ Recalling ~~

535
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:02,958
Under Section 972/552.

536
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,961
Hello. I wonder
if you could telI me where the -

537
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,031
Piss off!

538
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:15,262
Hello.

539
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:17,340
I'Il never confess!

540
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,706
Hey, come on!
You gotta interrogate me!

541
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,877
Mrs. Buttle?.

542
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,978
Uh, Mrs. Buttle?.

543
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:10,026
Ah. Um, are you Mrs. Buttle?.

544
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,764
Um...

545
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,959
my name's Lowry.

546
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,470
Uh, Sam Lowry.

547
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,440
Um, I'm from
the Ministry of Information.

548
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:33,012
I've come to give you a check.

549
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,420
Um, it's a refund, actually.

550
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:43,493
- There was a mistake.
- Mistake?.

551
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,494
Yes, yes.
Not in my department, of course.

552
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,496
I'm only Records.

553
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,158
No, it, uh -
I'll tell you what it is.

554
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:53,998
It seems that Mr. Buttle was overcharged
by Information Retrieval.

555
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,037
Yes, they don't usually make mistakes,
but, uh...

556
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,542
well, I suppose we're all human.

557
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,681
Oh!

558
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,751
What happened to the, um -

559
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,889
Actually, you know, my coming here
is rather unorthodox, bringing you this check...

560
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:19,952
as any payments are normally
made through Central Computer, but, um -

561
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:23,932
Well, as there were
certain... difficulties...

562
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:27,003
we thought,
well, rather than cause delay...

563
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,334
we'd let you have it now.

564
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,568
You know, it being Christmas and all.

565
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:35,304
My husband's dead, isn't he?.

566
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:41,149
Um, I do assure you, Mrs. Buttle,
the ministry is very scrupulous...

567
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:44,084
about following up
and eradicating any error.

568
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:47,021
But ifyou do have any complaints
you wish to make...

569
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:51,356
I'd be, well, only too happy
to send you the appropriate forms.

570
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,930
What have you done with his body?.

571
00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:00,196
Oh!
Gosh.

572
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,205
Um, I-I don't know
anything about that, Mrs. Buttle.

573
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,207
I'm really just delivering the check.

574
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:11,043
So, if, um - Look, ifyou wouldn't mind
just signing these two receipts...

575
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:15,608
I'd be only too happy to, uh -
to leave you in peace.

576
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,210
He hadn't done anything.

577
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,222
He was good!

578
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:26,353
What have you done
with his body?

579
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:35,767
It isn't being very helpful, Mrs. Buttle.

580
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,913
I didn't have to come here,
you know, Mrs. Buttle.

581
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,916
I'll kill you!

582
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,918
I'll kill you, you bastard!

583
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,422
- Hey!

584
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,625
Get off!.

585
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,759
Are you all right?.

586
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,105
Are you all right?.

587
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,979
Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?

588
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,945
I t's you!

589
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,017
Wait! Stop! Don't go! Stop!

590
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,158
Ow!

591
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:18,341
Oh, look! He 'll never get that out!

592
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:36,218
Stop! I had nothing
to do with it! Wait!

593
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:38,294
Stop!

594
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,363
He 's coming back!

595
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,909
- Jesus Christ!

596
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:00,310
Jesus..

597
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:03,648
- Go away.
- Her name's Jill

598
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:06,848
What? Jill?

599
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:09,892
Jill who? Jill who?

600
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,393
Layton.

601
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,065
Jill Layton.

602
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,534
You're a very good little girl.
What are you doing here?

603
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,832
Waiting for my daddy.

604
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,909
He will be pleased
when he gets home.

605
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:14,685
Sam, I've just
had the Transport Pool onto me.

606
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,988
You don't anything about a personnel transporter
gone missing, do you?.

607
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,962
Personnel transporter?. What?.

608
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,295
- Oh, the prannets. I had a personal transporter.
- Huh.

609
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,301
I'll do the paperwork in the morning.

610
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,804
Um, is it all right about Mrs. Tuttl -

611
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:33,138
Uh, Buttle's check?.

612
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,143
- Uh-huh.
- Can I forget it?.

613
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,304
- Yeah.
- Oh, what a relief.

614
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,678
I'm gonna have nightmares, you know.

615
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,577
- Oh, damn and blast!
- What's the matter?.

616
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:50,751
I don't suppose you'd happen to know
how I can get round an I RQ/3, do you?.

617
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:53,830
Ooh, all information
on third-level suspects is classified.

618
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:58,368
All inquiries through Information Retrieval,
and that's hopeless. They never tell you anything.

619
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:01,801
Come the time
they want something from us, oh, yes.

620
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:06,433
There is one way I could get round it.
I could accept my mother's promotion.

621
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,443
Yes.

622
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:10,604
No!

623
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,841
You can't.
You've just turned it down.

624
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,111
I didn't sign the form.

625
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,221
I did it foryou.

626
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,186
- You didn't.
- I did.

627
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,850
You didn't!

628
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,122
I did!

629
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:27,856
What did you do that for?.

630
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,991
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

631
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,865
Oh, I don't know.

632
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,098
I don't know what I want.

633
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:40,176
Come on,
before they turn the lights out.

634
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,360
There is one way round it.

635
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:02,421
I could always accept promotion
to Information Retrieval.

636
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:44,633
Sam!

637
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:58,173
- Oh, Christ.

638
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:24,873
What are you doing?.
What - My God! What's going on?.

639
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:28,206
- Emergency procedures.
- Emergency procedures!

640
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,677
- I haven't got an emergency!
- Yeah?.

641
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:34,682
- This is an emergency!
- Have a nice day. This has not been a recording.

642
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:36,684
Aah!

643
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:39,414
- Here. Sign that.

644
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,288
- What is it?.
- A 27B/6.

645
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,554
What do you think it is?.
Where's he gone?.

646
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,256
Spoor, come here!
Look! I got it! I found it!

647
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:51,334
Spoor! Spoor!
Come here, Spoor!

648
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:55,063
I t's a bypass valve on this -
on the transformer.

649
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,912
- Tuttle!

650
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,312
Tuttle. It's Tuttle.

651
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,777
You've had that scab Tuttle here,
ain't ya?.

652
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,582
What are you talking about?.

653
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,590
- Who fixed your ducts?. Huh?.
- Fixed your ducts, all right.

654
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,751
I told you before -
they fixed themselves.

655
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,762
Oh, yeah?. Then where did this
come from, eh?.

656
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,526
Out ofyour nostril?. Eh?.

657
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:26,101
- Nostrils, eh?

658
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:29,639
Central Services.

659
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:33,875
They don't take kindly to sabotage.

660
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:37,435
- Sabotage, huh?

661
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:42,218
- Jesus, this place is in a terrible state.

662
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,254
Just a minute!
You're not gonna leave it like this, are you?

663
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:49,121
Why not?. Al I you gotta do
is blow your nose and it's fixed, innit?.

664
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,160
That's right!

665
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,229
WelI -

666
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:56,855
Oh, my -

667
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:58,935
Jesus!

668
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:33,258
[Mrs. Buttle ]
What haveyou done with his body?

669
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:54,033

thanks.

679
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:34,140
- It's reply paid.
- Is it?.

680
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:37,042
Oh. Um -

681
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,415
Two, three -

682
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,418
~ Mother, I'm sorry, but I'm unable
to come to your party ~

683
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,216
- You don't have to sing it.
- I don't?.

684
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:48,222
No.

685
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,792
Oh. Sorry.

686
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:57,161
Aren't you a bit late?.
I mean, the party started an hour ago.

687
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,326
Yeah. It's the backlog.
Everybody complains.

688
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:01,403
- Oh.
- Was it all right otherwise?.

689
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:15,583
Mr. Helpmann, I'm keen to
get into Information Retrieval.

690
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:18,711
Mr. Helpmann, I'm dying
to get at this woman. No, no - Ohh!

691
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:20,789
Oh, God.

692
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:27,495
- Hold up.
- What?. Who are you?.

693
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:30,498
- Hey! What's going on?.
- Where's your invitation?.

694
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,092
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Mother! Mother!

695
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:36,103
Sam.

696
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:38,935
I'm so glad you came.

697
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:41,442
Come in.

698
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:44,274
- Mother?.
- Come in.

699
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:47,715
Oh, God, Mother, is that you?.

700
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:50,718
Of course.
Isn't it wonderful?.

701
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:54,119
- The bandages came off just this afternoon.

702
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:58,125
Come on, darling.Join in the fun.
Simply everybody's here.

703
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:00,127
- Is Mr. Helpmann here?

704
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:02,129
- Would you stop shoving -
- Yes, he is.

705
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:05,132
Mr. Helpmann is here,
and he wants to talk to you.

706
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:07,464
Good. I want to talk to him.

707
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:11,631
He says that you're the first person
ever to refuse a promotion.

708
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:14,141
- Ah, well -
- He thinks you should see a doctor.

709
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:18,077
- Actually, Mother, I've decided -
- Oh, Louis! Louis, you know Sam.

710
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:20,581
Can you believe it?.

711
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:23,481
It's just me and my little knife.

712
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:26,487
- Snip, snip, slice, slice.
- It's marvelous.

713
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:29,490
- Can you believe it?.
- Congratulations.

714
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:32,288
- But this is just the beginning.
- Oh, really?.

715
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:35,387
Oh, Christ, yes.
You've seen her with her clothes off.

716
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:38,695
Faces are a doddle
compared to tits and ass.

717
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,770
- No hairline.
- Oh, really, Louis!

718
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,707
I've been looking foryou
eveywhere, Ida.

719
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:53,147
Mother. Mother, I have to
talk to Mr. Helpmann.

720
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:56,878
- Oh, you stupid sod.
- Dear boy.

721
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,250
What do you think ofyour mother now?.

722
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,323
[Man ]
It'll neverlast.

723
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,560
Excuse me.

724
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,187
Dr. Chapman,
did you say something?.

725
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:10,265
That technique - I 've tried it.

726
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:13,767
Oh, nice effect,
but highly unstable.

727
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:18,068
In six months
she'll look like Grandma Moses.

728
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:23,077
Now, see here, Chapman, at least mine
don't end up looking like they've been mugged.

729
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,773
Sam! Sam!

730
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:32,753
What have you done with his body?

731
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,551
Sam!

732
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:37,057
Sam?

733
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:41,062
- What on earth's happened to you?.
- There was a little complication.

734
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:46,363
Dr. Chapman says it often happens
with a delicate skin like mine.

735
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,369
Nothing to worry about.

736
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:51,929
He's promised me these bandages
will be off in a jiffy.

737
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,874
- Actually, there's someone I want to meet.
- Oh, I know.

738
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:57,275
I know.

739
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:02,050
There we are.

740
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:05,882
I'm going to leave
you two lovebirds in peace.

741
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:09,256
Hello, Shirley.

742
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:12,850
- Oh, God.
- Come on!

743
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:14,930
Do you want a drink?.

744
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,999
Oh. Hello.

745
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:23,004
- Chase those years away!

746
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:25,472
Listen, Shirley...

747
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:29,636
your mother and my mother,
they seem to have got the idea that -

748
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,146
Look, I'm very flattered
and, uh, well...

749
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:35,149
I just don't want you to be
under any false impressions.

750
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,151
It's all right.

751
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,551
I don't like you either.

752
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:43,092
Sam!

753
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,224
Jack.
Excuse me, Shirley.

754
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:50,026
- I'm sorry.

755
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:54,434
- Sam! You remember Alison?.
- Evening.

756
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:57,233
Alison. Sam Lowry.
Old friend.

757
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,570
Alison, yes, of course.

758
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:02,576
- You look different.
- Well, I'm two years older.

759
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:04,805
- And she's been to Dr. Jaffe.
- Ah.

760
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:07,940
She doesn't like me telling people,
but, in fact, she's really pleased.

761
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:11,781
- I knew there was something different.
- Remember how they used to stick out?.

762
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:15,949
What?. Oh, yes.
Uh, well, rather.

763
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:19,357
- Always used to wonder if they were real.
- What, my ears?.

764
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:22,630
Sorry?.

765
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,859
Dr. Jaffe pinned her ears back.

766
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,867
Yes, that's what I -

767
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,233
Always used to wonder
if she wore falsies.

768
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:31,602
Ah! Mr. Helpmann.

769
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:34,574
False ears -
Mr. Helpmann!

770
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:37,304
- Hello,Jack.
- You remember my wife, Alison?.

771
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:39,313
Yes, of course.
Barbara, isn't it?.

772
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:41,315
- How are you?.
- Well, actuall -

773
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:44,318
Barbara's very well, thankyou, sir.
Very well indeed. How are you?.

774
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,320
- Fine, thanks.
- Good.

775
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:49,949
Hello, Sam. Ida said you might be here.
Have you got a minute?.

776
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,960
- Would you excuse us?.
- Oh, no, of course.

777
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:55,690
Of course.
Come on, Alison - Barbara.

778
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,134
Sam.

779
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:04,273
I need your help.

780
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:28,789
Thanks very much, Sam.

781
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:31,526
Mr. Helpmann,
I'm glad to be of help.

782
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:35,195
- If I can help you -
- Ah, well, actually -

783
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:37,295
Oh.

784
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,777
Your father and I were very close.

785
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:47,213
Of course,Jeremiah was senior to me,
but we were close friends.

786
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:49,750
Especially after the bombing.

787
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:54,686
And I keep his name alive
at the office every day.

788
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,387
It's as though he's there
still speaking to me.

789
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:01,895
"'Ere I am.

790
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:04,592
J.H."

791
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,362
The ghost in the machine.

792
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,198
I know he would have
wanted me to help you.

793
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,645
And I promised your mother...

794
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:23,151
that I'd take you on to the team
at Information Retrieval.

795
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,584
But I gather that, um -

796
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:30,421
Well, actually, Mr. Helpmann, I've, uh -
I've changed my mind.

797
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:33,825
I've decided I'd accept the transfer...

798
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,898
if I'm not too late.

799
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,833
Too late?.

800
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,994
That's for me to say.

801
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,571
Well - Well, then, I, uh -

802
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,910
Welcome to Information Retrieval.

803
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,446
Uh, my name's Lowry.

804
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,605
Sam Lowry.

805
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:31,118
I've been told to report
to Mr. Warrenn.

806
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,347
Thirtieth floor, sir.

807
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:35,424
You're expected.

808
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:40,995
Um, don't you want to search me?.

809
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:43,065
No, sir.

810
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,961
- Want to see my I. D.?.
- No need, sir.

811
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:52,402
- But I could be anybody.
- No, you couldn't, sir.

812
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,409
This is Information Retrieval.

813
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,639
- The lift's arrived, sir.

814
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:24,522
- I want that order rescinded!

815
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,946
- Halfas terrorists, the rest as victims.

816
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:49,718
Yes. No.

817
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:51,554
Definitely no!

818
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,356
- My name's Lowry, Mr. Warrenn. Sam Lowry.
- Ah, Lowry!

819
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:58,957
- Yes. No. Cancel that. Okay.

820
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:01,502
- Glad to have you aboard. Yes.
- These requisitions -

821
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:04,630
- Sir, I'd like to point this out -
- No! Don't be ridiculous,Jenkins.

822
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:07,231
- About these invoices -
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

823
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:09,504
You'll like it up here.
Send that back.

824
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:12,775
We've got a crack team of -
Are they kidding?. Decision makers.

825
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:14,782
No, in triplicate.

826
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:17,352
I'm expecting big things -
Two copies to Financial!

827
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:21,355
No. No.
Don't let Progress see those.

828
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:25,052
Between you and me, Lowry, this - No, no!
department - Tell Records to get stuffed!

829
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,061
is about to be upgraded and -

830
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:30,929
Ah! Here we are.

831
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:34,264
Your very own number
on your very own door.

832
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:37,271
And behind that door,
your very own office.

833
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:40,274
Congratulations, DZ/0 1 5.

834
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,401
Welcome to the team.

835
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,877
Yes! No! Cancel that!

836
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,244
Send two copies to Financial!

837
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:23,143
Well, you can't borrow any more chairs!

838
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:25,805
There's only one left in here now,
and I need that to sit on!

839
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,506
What?.

840
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,641
Oh.

841
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:32,312
Sorry.

842
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:34,480
Who are you?.

843
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:36,990
My name's Lowry.
Sam Lowry.

844
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:40,391
Oh, yes.

845
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:44,331
My name's Lime.
Harvey Lime.

846
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:46,333
Welcome to Expediting.

847
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:49,336
I say, look, would you mind
if I borrowed your computer console?.

848
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:52,339
- What?.
- Yes, I'll let you have it back in 10 minutes.

849
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:56,036
You want to take my console
into your office?.

850
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,045
Yes.J ust for a few minutes.

851
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,172
I-I'll tell you what.

852
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:02,273
You tell me what you want...

853
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:04,545
and I'll do it for you.

854
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:06,951
I'm a bit of a whiz on that thing.

855
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:08,956
Um...

856
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:10,958
all right.

857
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:14,894
Uh, I need some information
on a woman named Layton.

858
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:16,965
A woman, eh?.

859
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:19,364
- I see.
- Yes.

860
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:23,097
I know her age and distinguishing marks,
but I need an address or a place ofwork.

861
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:26,106
This your dream girl, is it?.

862
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,369
What?. Um -

863
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:30,536
Look, let me use your console.

864
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:32,546
You must be joking.

865
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:37,642
When there's a woman involved,
there's no stopping me.

866
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,721
Let's have that sheet.

867
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,665
Sod it! It's broken!

868
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:52,734
You haven't switched it on.

869
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,970
Oh, yes.

870
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,441
Look, you're putting me off standing there.

871
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:05,570
- Why don't you go back to your office
and I 'll give you a knock when I'm finished.
- Um -

872
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:08,013
Go on. I'm not going to elope with her.

873
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:11,486
All right.

874
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:49,318
Sam!

875
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,707
Sam.

876
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,419
Don't go.

877
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:21,546
Please.

878
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:35,363
Well?

879
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,871
Computers are my forte.

880
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,873
Let me see.

881
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:44,071
"Jillian Layton. Coloring: white.
Hair: blonde. Eyes: blue. Height: 5 foot 4.

882
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:46,841
Distinguishing marks:
scar on left" -

883
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:48,849
Is this all you've got?.

884
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:52,853
Best to take things slowly
where some women are concerned.

885
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:54,923
- Let me see.

886
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:57,958
- Hey! That's mine!

887
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,894
"Layton."

888
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:02,896
"Truck driver."

889
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:07,594
All inquiries, reference office
of 41 2/L, room 5001."

890
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,198
Ah, Lowry, glad I caught you.
No! Send that back!

891
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:15,833
- Mr. Warrenn!
- Are you settling down?.
I want this order rescinded.

892
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:18,344
There's a query about a personnel transporter
you took out from the pool.

893
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:20,347
Tell them no.
Tell them yes.

894
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:23,009
Or was it a personnel carrier
you took out from Transportation?.

895
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:26,019
Send that up to Security.
Anyway, tidy it up, Lowry.

896
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:28,021
There's a good chap.
And get a new suit.

897
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:30,023
- Don't you want the lift?.

898
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:50,669
- Can I help you?.

899
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:54,264
No! No! No! Please!

900
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:58,210
- I 'm, uh - I 'm looking for Officer 412/L.

901
01:16:58,313 --> 01:17:00,781
He won't be very long now.

902
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:05,344
- H m m. I thought so.

903
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,922
You may go in now.

904
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:20,560
Oh, uh, not that one.

905
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:23,536
That one. Yes.

906
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:34,248
Excuse me.
Are you Officer 412/L?.

907
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,624
Excuse me!

908
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:45,654
J ack.

909
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,752
Sam.

910
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:50,627
- Ah! I heard you were coming aboard.

911
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:54,759
Congratulations, "DZ/01 5."

912
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,895
Thanks.
Are you Officer 41 2/L?.

913
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,405
Uh-huh. That's me.

914
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:02,807
Oh, and, Sam,
a very happy Christmas.

915
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:04,811
- Thanks, Jack.
- Are you settling in all right?.

916
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:08,246
Yes, fine.Jack, I -
I need some information.

917
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:11,410
Oh, Sam, this is Information Retrieval,
not Information Dispersal.

918
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,420
- Hey! Amy!

919
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,422
Don't throw the ball around in here.

920
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,424
I'm not Amy. I'm Holly.

921
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,551
Did I call you Amy, darling?.
I'm sorry.

922
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:21,595
- A triplet?.
- One of them, I think.

923
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:24,564
Barbara's taken the other two
Christmas shopping.

924
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:27,567
You're not going to keep
calling her Barbara, are you?.

925
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:30,365
Why ever not?.
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?.

926
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:32,997
Don't you like it?.

927
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:35,201
Yes, it's... fine.

928
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:38,279
Come on.
Let's get these together.

929
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:41,076
-Jack.
- Now bring me the blue one over there.

930
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:43,083
I need to find out about a woman.

931
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:47,212
Come on, Chloe, let's show Uncle Sam here
how we can make the word "cat." Shall we?.

932
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:49,882
- I 'm Holly.
- Sorry, love. So you are.

933
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:51,959
- Cat.
- This is her.

934
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:55,128
Layton.

935
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,198
Oh, shit.

936
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,895
- How much do you know about this?.
- Uh, not much.

937
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:03,436
What does B58/732 mean to you?.

938
01:19:03,538 --> 01:19:06,439
- Buttle.
- I knew it.

939
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:09,704
You always were bloody quick, Sam.

940
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:13,178
Who else knows?.
Warrenn?. Helpmann?.

941
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:15,511
I don't know.
I only know you got the wrong man.

942
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:18,518
Information Transit got the wrong man.

943
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,520
I got the right man.

944
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:23,022
The wrong man was delivered to me
as the right man.

945
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:26,526
I accepted him on good faith
as the right man. Was I wrong?.

946
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:28,528
You killed Buttle?.

947
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:34,193
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down
to prevent such things happening.

948
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:37,669
It wasn't my fault that Buttle's heart condition
didn't appear on Tuttle's file.

949
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,673
Come and look.
How you getting on?.

950
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,744
-Jack.
- A, B, C-

951
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:45,074
- I really need to know about -
- Tuttle?.

952
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,842
Well, we're gonna have to bring
Mr. Tuttle in, aren't we?.

953
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:50,850
And interrogate him
at the same voltage as Mr. Buttle.

954
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:52,852
And juggle the books
in Electrical Banking.

955
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:57,050
- What has Tuttle done?.
- We suspect him of, uh, freelance subversion.

956
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:59,127
A freelance subversive.

957
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:02,162
Then all I need to wrap up the case
is the Layton woman.

958
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:04,164
What has she done?.

959
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:07,030
Well, she witnessed the Tuttle -
Um, the Buttle arrest.

960
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:09,501
Since then, she's been going around
making wild allegations...

961
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:12,038
obviously trying to exploit the situation.

962
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,404
She's working for someone,
and I don't think it's us.

963
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:17,205
- That's it. Overthere, love.
- Terrorist?.

964
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,878
Mr. Lint, the next customer has been delivered.

965
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:25,146
- Thank you, Myrtle.
- What are you gonna do
about the Layton woman?.

966
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:29,155
Well, I put her on the detention list.
Security should have her here before 6:00.

967
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:34,258
What, here?. So that she can
spill the beans inside the department?.

968
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:36,353
- Don't do that!

969
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:39,831
Jack, why don't I
try and get to her for you?.

970
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:42,904
I 'll, um - I 'll deactivate her.

971
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:46,599
What does that mean, Sam?. I don't want
to get involved in anything unsavory.

972
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,335
Trust me,Jack.

973
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:52,938
- Come on, darling. Put these away now.
Mummy'll be here soon.
- Let me have her file.

974
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:57,451
Look, trust me,Jack.

975
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:01,687
All right.
Come on here.

976
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:05,783
All right, but for Christ's sake,
don't lose it.

977
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:08,419
All right.

978
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,725
You sit down there, Mary.
Sam.

979
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:12,800
Don't worry.
I 'll get to her.

980
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:15,199
You'll never get anywhere
in a suit like that.

981
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:18,667
Here.

982
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,938
Try this.

983
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:24,443
- Bye-bye.
- Bye!

984
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:28,812
Uh, but, Jack, I -

985
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:33,081
Put it on, big boy.
I won't look at your willy.

986
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:46,790
Oh, let him go.

987
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,811
- Trier, isn't he?.

988
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:36,743
J ust - I 've been to
the department of -

989
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:59,797
But you've stam ped this form before.
Why won't you stam p it now?.

990
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:03,400
You just said yourself, miss -
we've already stamped it.

991
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:15,554
No, no! Stop!

992
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:18,558
Up! Up! Up! Up! Up!

993
01:23:20,695 --> 01:23:23,129
Oh, God.

994
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:25,199
Come on!

995
01:23:28,136 --> 01:23:29,660
Shit!

996
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:46,952
Oi!
Come out ofthere.

997
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:49,922
- What?.
- That's the deputy minister's lift.

998
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:53,085
- I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry.
- Oi, come here.

999
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:56,095
Come here, sonny.
Let's see your I. D. card, eh?.

1000
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:59,598
My I. D.?. Oh, God.

1001
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,601
This isn't my suit.

1002
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:06,072
Myname is Lowry. Sam Lowry.
Look, really, can't this wait?

1003
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:10,474
No, sir. I 'm going to have to
fill in a report on this.

1004
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:13,479
Now, then, uh,
what is the date today?.

1005
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:15,879
It's the -
Oh, God, it'll have to wait!

1006
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:18,976
Oi! Oi, you! Stop!
Come back here! Stop!

1007
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:45,108
Aim!

1008
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:51,250
Stop! Don't -

1009
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:53,252
- Up!

1010
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:08,200
Well done, men.
Quick thinking.

1011
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:10,203
- Excellent work.

1012
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:14,207
Um - 
I'll take charge of her now.

1013
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:16,209
Good. Good man.

1014
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:18,711
Um, okay.

1015
01:25:18,813 --> 01:25:22,180
Uh - It's a...

1016
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:25,113
classified matter...

1017
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:27,586
and, um, I'll, uh -

1018
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:31,750
I'll include your fine handling
of the situation in my report.

1019
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:33,828
Great.

1020
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,963
Uh, merry Christmas, Dawson.

1021
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:41,968
Come along with me, please.
Please?. Okay. Yes.

1022
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:44,402
Well done, men. Excellent.

1023
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:47,134
Good turnout. Nice.
Very good. Thank you.

1024
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:52,038
No, no, no. This way, please.
Straight ahead.

1025
01:25:59,954 --> 01:26:01,854
This way. This way.

1026
01:26:01,956 --> 01:26:04,322
This way.

1027
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:09,195
Just keep moving.

1028
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:11,231
- Hey! Stop!
- What?.

1029
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,397
Come back here!

1030
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:16,197
Pick up all these things!

1031
01:26:16,304 --> 01:26:19,398
- Come on! Pick them up!
- Geez - Oh -

1032
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:22,101
- Disgraceful!

1033
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:24,235
- Can't you read English?.
- Ow! Get your bloody -

1034
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:29,112
You illiterate foreign pig!
You come over here on your own -

1035
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:34,449
...and think you can
mess up our streets!

1036
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:36,922
- Oh, God.

1037
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,460
Stop!

1038
01:26:51,172 --> 01:26:53,970
That's it! Let's go!
Vroom! Vroom!

1039
01:26:58,012 --> 01:27:01,311
What are you doing?.
For Christ's sake, keep moving!

1040
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,311
- Get out of my cab.
- What?.

1041
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,388
J ust drive!

1042
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:10,590
You touched me.
Nobody touches me.

1043
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:12,887
What are you - Oh, God!

1044
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:14,894
Please! Please! Drive on!

1045
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:17,897
Drive on, will you! For -
Oh, shit. Move over. I 'll drive.

1046
01:27:17,999 --> 01:27:21,264
- Don't touch that! Don't touch anything!

1047
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:28,138
It's okay, Officer. Thank you. It's okay.
Got everything under control. Thankyou.

1048
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,473
Oh, shit. They're coming.

1049
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:34,639
Listen, please drive. Drive.
Trust me. You are in terrible danger.

1050
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:36,910
You are an embarrassment.
Please.

1051
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:39,009
Please drive.
Trust me. Trust me.

1052
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,384
Drive, and I'll explain everything.

1053
01:27:41,489 --> 01:27:43,389
Please...

1054
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:45,482
get out of my cab.

1055
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:49,127
- I 'm sorry. I -
- Okay!

1056
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:51,130
Okay, you've asked for it!

1057
01:27:51,232 --> 01:27:53,496
I 'm Information Retrieval Officer D -

1058
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:55,501
DZ/1 05!

1059
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:57,833
And I 'm arresting you as a -

1060
01:27:57,939 --> 01:28:01,067
Drive on, or I'll blast
your fucking head off!.

1061
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:05,579
Go!

1062
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:26,532
Look, I 'm, uh - I'm sorry about that.

1063
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,864
I mean, uh, touching you
without permission.

1064
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,530
But, um - Hello.

1065
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:34,233
My name is Lowry.
Sam Lowry.

1066
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:36,537
I - I'm - I've been, uh -

1067
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:44,550
You won't believe this,
and I know it's going to sound incredible...

1068
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:47,746
but, um - but I've been
dreaming about you.

1069
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:51,418
No, not like that. I mean, I love you.

1070
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:55,026
In my dreams I love you.

1071
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:59,088
And, uh - 
I mean - Extraordinary, isn't it?.

1072
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:06,365
Anyway, um...

1073
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:08,374
y-y-you-

1074
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:13,208
You don't believe me, do you?.

1075
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:15,214
You, um -

1076
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:19,776
You probably think I-I-I-I'm bonkers, right?.
Mad. Raving.

1077
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:25,222
No! No, I think
you're very attractive.

1078
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:27,760
What?.

1079
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:31,957
Yeah. Yeah, sit back.
Let me have a look at you.

1080
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:42,105
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1081
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:45,611
Good-looking, sexy.
J ust my type.

1082
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:50,144
I don't believe you.

1083
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:51,809
Why not?.

1084
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:55,753
Well, I-I - I just don't deserve
such terrific luck.

1085
01:29:57,158 --> 01:29:58,887
Damn right.

1086
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:25,985
Help!

1087
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:04,122
- I love -

1088
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:48,094
You don't trust me, do you?.

1089
01:31:48,202 --> 01:31:51,501
Oh!

1090
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:25,571
Oh, my God.
We shouldn't have come here.

1091
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:28,073
I got a job to do!

1092
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:31,576
- But they'll be lying in wait.
- Oh, Christ, you're paranoid.

1093
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,079
You've got no sense of reality.

1094
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:36,479
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

1095
01:32:39,987 --> 01:32:42,319
We should take the lorry
and get away!

1096
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:45,324
- Yeah?. Where to?.
- Anywhere, as fast as possible.

1097
01:32:45,426 --> 01:32:48,327
- There isn't anywhere!
-J ust far away!

1098
01:32:48,429 --> 01:32:50,329
That's not far enough!

1099
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:52,399
But - Wait!

1100
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,481
Jill!

1101
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:04,096
What's in the, uh, parcel?.

1102
01:34:05,339 --> 01:34:07,500
- Christmas present.
- Oh.

1103
01:34:15,349 --> 01:34:17,544
It's heavy.

1104
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:19,779
Heavy Christmas present.

1105
01:34:19,887 --> 01:34:22,048
- You don't trust me, open it.
- No!

1106
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:24,681
No, no, it's, uh - it's fine.

1107
01:34:25,926 --> 01:34:28,190
I'd spoil the wrapping.

1108
01:34:28,295 --> 01:34:32,163
Anyway, if I want you to trust me,
then it's only fair that I should trust you. Right?.

1109
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:43,807
Doesn't it botheryou, the sort of things
you do at Information Retrieval?.

1110
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:45,879
What?.

1111
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:49,574
I suppose you'd rather
have terrorists.

1112
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:52,414
- Here's one now.

1113
01:34:53,754 --> 01:34:58,020
How many terrorists have you met, Sam?.
Actual terrorists?.

1114
01:35:00,327 --> 01:35:02,295
- Actual terrorists?.
- Yeah.

1115
01:35:06,033 --> 01:35:08,627
Well -
It's only my first day.

1116
01:35:20,748 --> 01:35:23,717
- Uh-oh.
- A roadblock.

1117
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,779
- What are we gonna do?.
- Stay calm.

1118
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:29,788
Don't slow down.
Don't slow down!

1119
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:32,552
Don't stop. Please.
Please do as I say. Go.

1120
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:34,821
Go! Straight ahead! Go!

1121
01:35:34,929 --> 01:35:38,626
- Go! Go! Go!
- What are you doing, you stupid asshole?

1122
01:35:43,537 --> 01:35:45,004
Whoo!

1123
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:53,112
We did it! We did it!

1124
01:35:53,214 --> 01:35:56,650
We broke right through!
We did it! Whee, whee, whee, whee!

1125
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:04,990
- Faster! Don't let them see you! J ust go!
- Get off of me!

1126
01:36:07,928 --> 01:36:10,829
Keep going! Keep going! Faster!

1127
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:14,367
- Get your foot down on it! Move!
- Stay off of it!

1128
01:36:20,274 --> 01:36:23,141
- No!

1129
01:36:27,882 --> 01:36:30,350
- Get off!.

1130
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:41,492
- Shit!

1131
01:36:43,497 --> 01:36:44,691
Oh, no.

1132
01:36:47,968 --> 01:36:49,663
Faster! Faster!

1133
01:36:55,676 --> 01:36:58,975
- What ifwe lose the house, yeah?.
- Don't touch anything!

1134
01:37:00,181 --> 01:37:02,775
Don't touch it!

1135
01:37:24,638 --> 01:37:29,541
We did it! We did it!
We did it! We did it!

1136
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,818
Oh, no.

1137
01:37:51,665 --> 01:37:54,293
And what would you like for Christmas?.

1138
01:37:54,401 --> 01:37:56,767
My own credit card.

1139
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:03,176
Hmm.

1140
01:38:07,314 --> 01:38:09,544
- Why have we come here?.
- Go away!

1141
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:13,051
- Look, why don't we go back to my flat.
- Forget it.

1142
01:38:13,153 --> 01:38:15,553
- You don't trust me?.
- Trust you?. Trust you?.

1143
01:38:15,656 --> 01:38:17,886
A man who hijacks my truck,
loses me my job...

1144
01:38:17,992 --> 01:38:19,823
has every security man in town
looking for me?.

1145
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:21,895
- Of course I trust you.
- I was only trying to help.

1146
01:38:21,996 --> 01:38:23,896
- Yeah!
- Okay. Okay.

1147
01:38:23,998 --> 01:38:25,898
You don't trust me, I don't trust you.

1148
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,900
- What's in that parcel?.
- Oh,Jesus.

1149
01:38:28,002 --> 01:38:30,800
You saved it from the lorry.
It must be something very special.

1150
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:33,806
I saved you from the lorry.
You're not something "very special."

1151
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:36,308
- How can you - I'm gonna open it.
- Don't touch that!

1152
01:38:45,552 --> 01:38:49,010
Sam! It's me!

1153
01:38:49,123 --> 01:38:51,091
And Shirley!

1154
01:38:53,227 --> 01:38:55,195
Mrs. Terrain.

1155
01:38:58,232 --> 01:39:00,826
- That should hold it.
- Sam?

1156
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:03,460
Hello, Shirley.

1157
01:39:05,873 --> 01:39:08,137
My God, what on earth's
happened to you now?

1158
01:39:08,242 --> 01:39:11,973
My complication
had a little complication.

1159
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:16,038
But Dr. Chapman
says I'll soon be up...

1160
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:19,483
and bounding about
like a young gazelle.

1161
01:39:19,586 --> 01:39:22,180
You buying a Christmas present
for your mother?.

1162
01:39:22,289 --> 01:39:24,189
What?.

1163
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:27,158
Oh, um, yes.
A I ittle something.

1164
01:39:27,261 --> 01:39:30,856
Shi rley and I come here
"wegularlarly."

1165
01:39:31,932 --> 01:39:34,025
We love romantic lingerie.

1166
01:39:34,134 --> 01:39:36,364
- Really?

1167
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:40,566
- Sam, picture me in these.

1168
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:48,714
- Oh, my God.
- Sam, where are you going?.

1169
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:52,684
- Sam! Sam!

1170
01:40:01,362 --> 01:40:03,227
Jill?.

1171
01:40:06,633 --> 01:40:08,601
Jill!

1172
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:26,518
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?.

1173
01:40:31,058 --> 01:40:33,026
Well, you don't deserve to be!

1174
01:40:33,127 --> 01:40:36,153
What a bloody stupid thing!

1175
01:40:36,263 --> 01:40:39,596
How could you?.
Look at these people! My God!

1176
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:42,464
It was a bomb.
It was a bomb.

1177
01:40:42,569 --> 01:40:45,470
I should have opened it.
I sat there with it next - I -

1178
01:40:45,572 --> 01:40:47,563
What a stupid thing.

1179
01:40:47,674 --> 01:40:49,608
There's your bomb, asshole!

1180
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:55,480
Bribes...

1181
01:40:55,582 --> 01:40:57,641
for official monkeys like you.

1182
01:40:57,751 --> 01:41:00,151
Oh.

1183
01:41:01,555 --> 01:41:04,149
Go on.
Make yourself useful.

1184
01:41:08,095 --> 01:41:11,292
- Here.

1185
01:41:14,835 --> 01:41:18,271
- Don't touch her! She's hurt!

1186
01:41:18,372 --> 01:41:21,569
- Damn it!

1187
01:41:21,675 --> 01:41:24,303
- Don't touch her!
- No!

1188
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:29,412
Stop!

1189
01:41:36,723 --> 01:41:39,157
Sam, no! Sam! Behind you!

1190
01:41:51,905 --> 01:41:54,806
These helmets don't half
make your scalp itch.

1191
01:41:54,908 --> 01:41:58,435
Oh, don't mention it.
And they make you sweat.

1192
01:41:58,545 --> 01:42:01,446
Halfthe time
I can't eversee where I'm going.

1193
01:42:01,548 --> 01:42:05,177
There's a great Niagara
ofperspiration coming down.

1194
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:07,185
Wel , I'm Iucky.

1195
01:42:07,287 --> 01:42:09,187
I got these thick eyebrows.

1196
01:42:09,289 --> 01:42:12,781
That keeps it up
and channels it out to the ears.

1197
01:42:12,893 --> 01:42:14,793
Yeah. Who's he?

1198
01:42:14,895 --> 01:42:17,830
Oh, I don't know.
Somebody from Information Retrieval.

1199
01:42:17,931 --> 01:42:20,297
They're always hangin' around
in Lingerie.

1200
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,892
Where is she? Huh?

1201
01:42:24,004 --> 01:42:25,972
Jill, is that you?.

1202
01:42:26,073 --> 01:42:30,373
Uh - Excuse me, si r.
That is government property.

1203
01:42:31,411 --> 01:42:33,641
Oh, Jill.

1204
01:42:35,582 --> 01:42:37,777
Jill! Answer me!

1205
01:42:39,586 --> 01:42:42,077
I'm looking for a girl
with blonde hair.

1206
01:42:42,189 --> 01:42:44,817
She's medium height, green eyes.

1207
01:42:44,925 --> 01:42:48,292
I don't know, sir.
They check all that at the depot.

1208
01:42:48,395 --> 01:42:51,990
Uh, we can't allow that, sir.
It's more than our job's worth.

1209
01:42:52,099 --> 01:42:55,000
Jill!
Jill, you must be here! Jill!

1210
01:42:55,102 --> 01:42:58,435
Look, sir, you can fill in an application form,
sir, ifyou're a relative.

1211
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:00,439
Now, do stop, sir. Please.

1212
01:43:00,541 --> 01:43:02,771
Jill? Jill?

1213
01:43:02,876 --> 01:43:04,776
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

1214
01:43:08,415 --> 01:43:12,044
Sorry about that, sir.
Regulations.

1215
01:43:17,824 --> 01:43:20,691
This is a black eye
for the department, Lowry.

1216
01:43:20,794 --> 01:43:23,024
I don't care how you behaved
when you were at Records.

1217
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:25,860
Information Retrieval
is an executive branch.

1218
01:43:25,966 --> 01:43:28,764
We're proud of our reputation
and we protect it.

1219
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:32,771
Damn it, Lowry! That convoy of personnel
carriers is still not accounted for!

1220
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:35,808
I thought I told you to deal with it.
And what the hell is this mess?.

1221
01:43:35,909 --> 01:43:38,036
An empty desk is an efficient desk.

1222
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:40,909
Good God.
Queries from Security.

1223
01:43:41,014 --> 01:43:43,175
Searches from Central Banking
about a check?.

1224
01:43:43,283 --> 01:43:46,150
Clarification notices from Accounting
concerning unreturned receipts?.

1225
01:43:46,253 --> 01:43:49,745
- Mr. Warrenn, I have to find out about -
- Get up!

1226
01:43:49,856 --> 01:43:53,223
I don't know what's going on here, Lowry.

1227
01:43:53,327 --> 01:43:58,492
But don't thinkyou can intimidate us
with your friends and relatives in high places.

1228
01:43:58,599 --> 01:44:01,762
- Now shape up!

1229
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:07,139
Lime, I have to use your computer.

1230
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:09,641
Sorry.
A bit busy at the moment.

1231
01:44:09,743 --> 01:44:12,712
You seem to have rather a lot
to get on with yourself.

1232
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:21,415
- Shit.

1233
01:44:22,756 --> 01:44:24,656
Come off it, J ack.

1234
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:27,659
Of course you can check
to see if she's been arrested.

1235
01:44:27,761 --> 01:44:32,664
I 'm sorry, Sam. I 'm afraid this case has become
much more complicated since last we... talked.

1236
01:44:32,766 --> 01:44:35,826
But she's innocent,Jack.
She's done nothing wrong.

1237
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:38,837
Tell that to the wives of the security men
she blew up this afternoon.

1238
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:41,499
- She's not alone in all this.

1239
01:44:41,608 --> 01:44:44,668
We've just had a report in that Tuttle
has wrecked an entire flat...

1240
01:44:44,778 --> 01:44:47,178
and sabotaged
adjacent Central Services.

1241
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:50,182
As a matter of fact,
it looks like on your block.

1242
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:53,515
I should keep my eyes open
if I were you, Sam. Bye.

1243
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:57,784
But, Jack, you don't really think Tuttle
and the girl are in league, do you?.

1244
01:44:57,891 --> 01:44:59,290
I do.

1245
01:44:59,393 --> 01:45:01,486
Everything's connected
all along the line.

1246
01:45:01,595 --> 01:45:03,927
Cause and effect.
That's the beauty of it.

1247
01:45:04,031 --> 01:45:07,262
Our job is to trace the connections
and, uh, reveal them.

1248
01:45:09,436 --> 01:45:12,337
This whole Buttle-Tuttle confusion
was obviously planned from the inside.

1249
01:45:12,439 --> 01:45:14,339
Bye-bye.

1250
01:45:14,441 --> 01:45:16,671
Oh, but,Jack!

1251
01:45:16,777 --> 01:45:19,337
She's innocent,Jack.

1252
01:45:19,446 --> 01:45:22,347
Sam, we've always been close,
haven't we?.

1253
01:45:22,449 --> 01:45:24,349
Yes,Jack?.

1254
01:45:24,451 --> 01:45:27,909
Well, until this all blows over
just stay away from me.

1255
01:45:29,022 --> 01:45:30,990
But -

1256
01:47:33,246 --> 01:47:35,271
Oh, my God.

1257
01:47:37,951 --> 01:47:39,509
You.

1258
01:47:40,754 --> 01:47:43,689
It's you.
What's happening?.

1259
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:45,883
What's happening?.

1260
01:47:45,992 --> 01:47:47,892
Your thermostat's gone,
and then some.

1261
01:47:47,994 --> 01:47:49,894
- And then some!

1262
01:47:49,996 --> 01:47:51,896
What's happened to my flat?.

1263
01:47:51,998 --> 01:47:55,456
Hello?. What?.
It's foryou.

1264
01:47:55,569 --> 01:47:58,504
- But as you don't live here anymore -
- What?.

1265
01:47:58,605 --> 01:48:02,371
Absolutely.
Do you know what this is?.

1266
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:04,603
This is an H2206...

1267
01:48:04,711 --> 01:48:09,205
authorizing the compulsory,
temporary requisitioning of this flat...

1268
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:11,216
for ournecessaryrepairs.

1269
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:13,218
- Repairs!
- What?.

1270
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,720
- No! You - 
- Don't forget your receipt.

1271
01:48:15,822 --> 01:48:18,848
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- No, sir. Don't forget your receipt.

1272
01:48:18,959 --> 01:48:22,019
I'm sorry, but I 'm a bit
of a stickler for paperwork.

1273
01:48:22,128 --> 01:48:25,029
He's a sticklerforpaperwork, sir!

1274
01:48:25,131 --> 01:48:27,725
- Bastards!

1275
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:32,229
Shh.

1276
01:48:38,211 --> 01:48:40,577
Tuttle.

1277
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:43,080
- What are you doing?.
- Shh.

1278
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:01,857
Phew-ee.

1279
01:49:33,333 --> 01:49:35,767
Oh, God.

1280
01:49:35,869 --> 01:49:38,337
- Jesus Christ!
- The smell! Stop!

1281
01:49:40,173 --> 01:49:42,073
Filling up with -

1282
01:49:42,175 --> 01:49:46,009
- Oh, God.

1283
01:49:47,447 --> 01:49:49,938
Oh, Jesus!

1284
01:49:53,019 --> 01:49:55,749
Oh!

1285
01:49:58,458 --> 01:50:00,426
Shit!

1286
01:50:02,095 --> 01:50:03,995
We're all in it together, kid.

1287
01:50:16,309 --> 01:50:18,869
Jill. Jill!

1288
01:50:19,913 --> 01:50:23,280
Jill. Oh, God.

1289
01:50:23,383 --> 01:50:26,875
Are you all right?.
What happened to you after -

1290
01:50:26,987 --> 01:50:29,820
Your face. Are you hurt?.

1291
01:50:30,857 --> 01:50:32,757
Um, no, I-I'm fine.

1292
01:50:32,859 --> 01:50:36,295
It's - Well -

1293
01:50:36,396 --> 01:50:38,921
I've been worried sick about you.

1294
01:50:52,812 --> 01:50:55,713
- Who was that?.
- That's a friend of mine. He -

1295
01:50:55,815 --> 01:50:59,012
- Oh, God. Holy shit.

1296
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:03,146
We'd better get out of here quick.
Come on. Quietly.

1297
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:09,128
Look out. Here. Take this.

1298
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:13,466
Looks big.

1299
01:51:24,077 --> 01:51:26,045
Here.

1300
01:51:27,781 --> 01:51:30,079
Quick. Quick.

1301
01:52:05,051 --> 01:52:08,509
- Are you sure this is all right?.
- Yes. Yes, certain.

1302
01:52:09,956 --> 01:52:12,083
My mother's away for Christmas.

1303
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:15,928
She's spending it at the plastic surgeon's.

1304
01:52:19,365 --> 01:52:21,492
The wraps come off tomorrow.

1305
01:53:01,941 --> 01:53:06,344
Lock the door after me.
Don't answer the phone to anyone.

1306
01:53:06,446 --> 01:53:08,710
I won't be long.

1307
01:53:09,949 --> 01:53:12,850
- Where are you going?.
- I know a way to save you.

1308
01:53:12,952 --> 01:53:16,115
- Trust me. I can do it.
- But you can't go without me.

1309
01:53:51,825 --> 01:53:54,885
Excuse me, Dawson. Could you put me through
to Mr. Helpmann's office, please?.

1310
01:53:54,994 --> 01:53:56,894
I'm afraid I can't, sir.

1311
01:53:56,996 --> 01:53:59,897
- You have to go through the proper channels.

1312
01:53:59,999 --> 01:54:05,403
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are
because that's classified information.

1313
01:54:05,505 --> 01:54:10,909
I'm glad to see the ministry is continuing
its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.

1314
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:12,978
Thankyou, Dawson.

1315
01:54:19,853 --> 01:54:23,152
- Good night, Mr. Lime.
- Good night, Dawson.

1316
01:54:36,536 --> 01:54:40,131
~ The first Noel~

1317
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:43,505

No, no, no, Arthur!

You' re fl at on the "G."

1323
01:54:57,790 --> 01:55:01,157
I t's your breathing.
Now take a deep breath after " Noel."

1324
01:55:01,261 --> 01:55:03,422
Ready?. One, two, three.

1325
01:55:03,529 --> 01:55:06,089

Mr. Hel pmann.

1332

Mr. Hel pmann?.

1333
01:57:52,565 --> 01:57:54,533
Jill.

1334
01:57:56,903 --> 01:57:58,871
Jill?

1335
01:58:13,319 --> 01:58:15,287
Jill?

1336
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:46,318
Who's there?.

1337
01:58:55,628 --> 01:58:58,188
What do you think?.

1338
01:58:58,297 --> 01:59:00,527
Is it me?.

1339
01:59:06,072 --> 01:59:08,040
Well?.

1340
01:59:12,979 --> 01:59:15,880
You don't exist anymore.

1341
01:59:15,982 --> 01:59:17,950
I've killed you.

1342
01:59:22,355 --> 01:59:24,323
J ill Layton is dead.

1343
01:59:32,999 --> 01:59:35,695
Care for a little necrophilia?.

1344
01:59:35,801 --> 01:59:37,769
Hmm?.

1345
01:59:39,605 --> 01:59:41,732
Yee-hah! Yee-hah!

1346
02:00:38,731 --> 02:00:41,325
Merry Christmas.

1347
02:00:42,435 --> 02:00:44,403
Uh -

1348
02:00:54,747 --> 02:00:56,715
Something for an executive?

1349
02:01:14,967 --> 02:01:18,027
Sh-She's dead.
This is just a friend of mine.

1350
02:01:18,137 --> 02:01:21,038
- She's -

1351
02:01:21,140 --> 02:01:23,040

02:01:59,178 --> 02:02:01,078
"tampering Central Services

1364

"obstruction of forces, Law and Order,

1367

"attempting to disrupt the Ministry of Information
Retrieval's internal communicating system;

1368
02:02:13,626 --> 02:02:15,719
wasting ministry time and paper."

1369
02:02:15,828 --> 02:02:18,353
- Now, either you plead guilty...

1370
02:02:18,464 --> 02:02:20,364
to, say, seven or eight of the charges...

1371
02:02:20,466 --> 02:02:23,833
which is going to help keep costs down
within your means...

1372
02:02:23,936 --> 02:02:28,066
oryou can borrow a sum, to be negotiated
from us, at a very competitive rate.

1373
02:02:28,174 --> 02:02:31,575
We can offeryou something,
let's say 1 1 and a half percent over 30 years...

1374
02:02:31,677 --> 02:02:34,578
but you will have to buy insurance
to qualify for this scheme.

1375
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:37,171
Or, ifyou prefer something
more specific...

1376
02:02:37,283 --> 02:02:39,911
say, against electrical charges
over $70 -

1377
02:02:40,019 --> 02:02:43,079
All you're requested to do at this stage
is to sign this form.

1378
02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:45,521
- Think carefully before you decide.

1379
02:02:45,624 --> 02:02:48,354
Looking ahead in financial matters
is always a wise course.

1380
02:02:56,369 --> 02:02:59,964
Sam, what are we going to do with you?.

1381
02:03:02,041 --> 02:03:04,009
Where is Jill?.

1382
02:03:05,711 --> 02:03:07,770
I 've got to find her.

1383
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:11,111
Please. Please, you've got to
get me out of here.

1384
02:03:11,217 --> 02:03:14,744
I understand, Sam.
I know exactly how you feel.

1385
02:03:14,854 --> 02:03:18,346
So I've brought you
a bottle of barley water.

1386
02:03:18,457 --> 02:03:21,119
Oh, please help me.

1387
02:03:21,227 --> 02:03:24,628
I assure you, Sam,
I 'm doing everything within my power.

1388
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:27,665
But the rules of the game
are laid down.

1389
02:03:27,767 --> 02:03:30,736
We all have to play by them.
Even me.

1390
02:03:31,904 --> 02:03:36,068
It's all a mistake.
You've got to understand that.

1391
02:03:36,175 --> 02:03:41,408
Yes, well, from the department's point ofview,
you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but -

1392
02:03:41,514 --> 02:03:44,176
I'm not a terrorist.

1393
02:03:44,283 --> 02:03:47,184
You must know that.
Please, please get me out of here.

1394
02:03:47,286 --> 02:03:50,744
Sam, information retrieval
is expensive.

1395
02:03:50,856 --> 02:03:53,791
You're running up an enormous bill
by not cooperating.

1396
02:03:53,893 --> 02:03:56,054
Please.

1397
02:03:56,162 --> 02:03:59,131
Please, Mr. Helpmann.

1398
02:03:59,231 --> 02:04:01,199
Help me find J ill.

1399
02:04:02,668 --> 02:04:04,568
Jill.

1400
02:04:04,670 --> 02:04:06,661
Yes.

1401
02:04:06,772 --> 02:04:10,003
Sam, I think I ought to tell you.

1402
02:04:10,109 --> 02:04:14,705
I'm afraid she's upped stumps
and retired to the pavilion.

1403
02:04:16,549 --> 02:04:18,517
Thrown in the towel.

1404
02:04:19,718 --> 02:04:21,618
Dead?.

1405
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:23,813
Yes.

1406
02:04:23,923 --> 02:04:26,892
It's all a bit confusing,
but it seems she was killed...

1407
02:04:26,992 --> 02:04:28,960
resisting arrest.

1408
02:04:31,997 --> 02:04:34,989
No. It's all right.

1409
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:37,068
I did that.

1410
02:04:39,738 --> 02:04:42,639
The odd thing is,
it appears to have happened twice.

1411
02:04:42,741 --> 02:04:44,936
Bit of a disputed call, I'm afraid.

1412
02:04:47,546 --> 02:04:49,514
Twice?.

1413
02:04:49,615 --> 02:04:51,515
So, there you are.

1414
02:04:51,617 --> 02:04:56,384
All I can say is, don't fall at the last fence,
the finishing post in sight.

1415
02:04:56,489 --> 02:04:58,389
See you in the paddock.

1416
02:04:58,491 --> 02:05:00,891
Do cooperate.
Think ofyour mother.

1417
02:05:00,993 --> 02:05:03,393
Good luck.
Keep your eye on the ball.

1418
02:05:03,496 --> 02:05:06,897
Gotta go.
Can't keep the orphans waiting.

1419
02:05:35,027 --> 02:05:37,120
Don't fight it, son.

1420
02:05:37,229 --> 02:05:39,288
Confess quickly.

1421
02:05:40,432 --> 02:05:43,595
I fyou hold out too long,
you could jeopardize your credit rating.

1422
02:05:55,514 --> 02:05:57,414
695/6.

1423
02:05:57,516 --> 02:06:00,246
- Thankyou.

1424
02:06:33,886 --> 02:06:36,150
Jack?

1425
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:43,453
Jack.

1426
02:06:43,562 --> 02:06:45,655
Jack.Jack!

1427
02:06:45,764 --> 02:06:47,664
Shut up.

1428
02:06:47,766 --> 02:06:50,963
Jack.Jack, I'm innocent.
Please.

1429
02:06:51,070 --> 02:06:53,334
- Help me.
- Bastard.

1430
02:06:54,573 --> 02:06:56,268
Jack.

1431
02:06:56,375 --> 02:06:59,071
Jack, this is all a mistake.
Please,Jack.

1432
02:06:59,178 --> 02:07:01,146
Take that mask off.

1433
02:07:06,318 --> 02:07:08,286
You stupid bastard.

1434
02:07:09,555 --> 02:07:11,989
-Jack.
- How could you do this to me?.

1435
02:07:12,091 --> 02:07:13,991
Jack, I'm frightened.

1436
02:07:14,093 --> 02:07:16,323
How do you think I feel, you shit?.

1437
02:07:16,428 --> 02:07:18,396
- Jack -
- Shut up!

1438
02:07:22,901 --> 02:07:27,235
This is a professional relationship.

1439
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:30,240
Jack.

1440
02:07:30,342 --> 02:07:33,539
Jack, no, you can't.

1441
02:07:33,646 --> 02:07:36,206
No, Jack, please.

1442
02:07:36,315 --> 02:07:38,408
Jack, no! Don't!

1443
02:07:38,517 --> 02:07:40,985
Please,Jack! No!

1444
02:08:26,065 --> 02:08:29,057
- You okay?.
- Tuttle!

1445
02:08:29,168 --> 02:08:31,136
Call me Harry.

1446
02:09:18,751 --> 02:09:21,049
Let's go!

1447
02:09:51,617 --> 02:09:53,050
Here. Here.

1448
02:14:30,295 --> 02:14:34,129
Ah, Mr. Lowry.
So pleased you could make it.

1449
02:14:34,232 --> 02:14:36,496
Right this way.

1450
02:14:41,006 --> 02:14:42,974
It's a sad loss.

1451
02:14:43,075 --> 02:14:45,771
Your mother was with her at the end.

1452
02:14:45,877 --> 02:14:50,109
The gift of eternal life.

1453
02:14:50,215 --> 02:14:55,346
Mrs. Terrain has just received
that most wonderful of gifts.

1454
02:14:55,454 --> 02:14:57,752
She came to us physically new.

1455
02:14:57,856 --> 02:15:01,917
She goes hence from us
not so physically new.

1456
02:15:02,027 --> 02:15:03,927
But the spirit never grows old.

1457
02:15:04,029 --> 02:15:07,123
Madame Lowry.

1458
02:15:11,470 --> 02:15:13,438
Mother.

1459
02:15:14,739 --> 02:15:16,639
Oh. Sam.

1460
02:15:16,741 --> 02:15:19,209
Mother. Mother!

1461
02:15:21,379 --> 02:15:23,609
Stop calling me that.

1462
02:15:24,649 --> 02:15:28,050
Mother! Mother, please!

1463
02:15:28,153 --> 02:15:31,520
- Is this guy bothering you?.
- Oh. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

1464
02:15:31,623 --> 02:15:34,456
Mother!

1465
02:15:34,559 --> 02:15:38,620
Go away.
This is a very sacred moment.

1466
02:18:48,153 --> 02:18:50,314
He's got away from us, Jack.

1467
02:18:50,422 --> 02:18:52,720
Afraid you're right, Mr. Helpmann.

1468
02:18:52,824 --> 02:18:55,384
He's gone.

1469
02:18:55,493 --> 02:18:57,927
Mmm.

1470
02:18:58,029 --> 02:18:59,997
Well -

1471
02:19:31,763 --> 02:19:34,630
~ Then~

1472
02:19:34,733 --> 02:19:40,103
~ Tomorrow was another day~

1473
02:19:40,205 --> 02:19:44,505
~ The morning found me miles away ~

1474
02:19:45,543 --> 02:19:50,845
~ With still a million things to say ~

1475
02:19:53,284 --> 02:19:56,151
~ Now ~

1476
02:19:56,254 --> 02:20:00,350
~ As twilight gleams the sky above ~

1477
02:20:01,559 --> 02:20:05,825
~ Recalling thrills of our love ~

1478
02:20:07,165 --> 02:20:11,534
~ There 's one thing I'm certain of~

1479
02:20:11,636 --> 02:20:14,537
~ Return ~

1480
02:20:14,639 --> 02:20:17,437
~ I will ~

1481
02:20:17,542 --> 02:20:21,000
~ To old ~

1482
02:20:21,112 --> 02:20:25,640
~ Brazil ~~
