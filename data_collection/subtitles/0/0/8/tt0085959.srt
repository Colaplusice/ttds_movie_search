{1152}{1207}In the bleak days of 1983...
{1224}{1326}as England languished in the doldrums|of a ruinous monetarist policy...
{1332}{1416}the good, loyal men|of the Permanent Assurance Company...
{1416}{1504}a once-proud family firm|recently fallen on hard times...
{1524}{1625}strained under the yoke of their|oppressive, new corporate management.
{1668}{1721}Terrible. Really terrible.
{2196}{2227}Row!
{2868}{2924}That's it, Evans. Youre fired.
{2940}{2985}You heard me. Out.
{3012}{3074}Did you hear that? Hes been sacked.
{3108}{3142}Sacked?
{3168}{3233}Sacked? Come on, boys. Lets get at em.
{3468}{3503}Come on!
{4788}{4834}Let me out of here!
{4872}{4925}I demand to see my lawyer!
{5148}{5191}Tooley! Come on.
{5892}{5940}Now, lads, lets move.
{5940}{6008}You, you and you, break open the weapons.
{6036}{6098}You, you and you, into the rigging.
{6132}{6199}- And you, put the kettle on.|- Aye, sir.
{6648}{6697}There, there, Charles.
{7404}{7437}Sorry!
{7440}{7493}Come on, Tooley. This way!
{8088}{8132}Weigh the anchor!
{8148}{8192}Weigh the anchor!
{8220}{8264}Weigh the anchor.
{9816}{9886}And so,|the Crimson Permanent Assurance...
{9888}{9976}was launched upon the high seas|of international finance.
{10428}{10492}Come on, boy. Watch it. Route. Route!
{10536}{10597}- Cup of tea, dear?|- Hey, captain!
{10620}{10666}Look! To starboard!
{10776}{10839}There it lay: the prize they sought.
{10884}{10929}Hard to starboard!
{10932}{11026}A financial district swollen|with multinationals, conglomerates...
{11052}{11114}and fat, bloated merchant banks.
{11196}{11256}All right, lads, battle stations!
{11316}{11360}Come on! Move it!
{11976}{12048}- All right, then. That's enough.|- Take cover.
{12564}{12602}Down, down!
{13512}{13557}Hard to starboard!
{14100}{14132}Fire!
{15806}{15857}Eric! My balance sheets!
{15914}{15964}Ross! Get the readouts!
{16142}{16187}- Stop him!|- Eric!
{16202}{16247}- Thanks!|- Charge!
{17474}{17539}- No, no! Let me! Let me!|- Okay, Kane.
{17690}{17726}Captured!
{17906}{17940}Gotcha!
{18842}{18879}Take this.
{19022}{19065}Here. File this.
{19346}{19378}Shit!
{19598}{19670}And so, heartened by their initial success...
{19682}{19783}the desperate and reasonably violent|men of the Permanent Assurance...
{19814}{19864}battled on, until...
{19922}{19988}as the sun set slowly in the west...
{20018}{20120}the outstanding returns on their bold|business venture became apparent.
{20162}{20232}Once-proud financial giants lay in ruins...
{20318}{20372}their assets stripped...
{20402}{20458}their policies in tatters.
{20798}{20853}Full speed ahead, Mr. Cohen!

{33611}{33671}Wonderful what we can do nowadays.
{33671}{33731}I see you have the machine|that goes "Ping!"
{33731}{33767}This is my favorite.
{33767}{33839}We lease this back|from the company we sold it to.
{33839}{33947}That way, it comes under the monthly|current budget and not the capital account.

{34919}{34963}Okay, shows over.
{34991}{35039}Is it a boy or a girl?
{35039}{35134}I think it's a little early|to start imposing roles on it, dont you?
{35135}{35159}A word of advice.
{35159}{35267}You may find you suffer for some time|a totally irrational feeling of depression...
{35267}{35303}P.N.D., as we doctors call it.
{35303}{35363}So, it's lots of happy pills for you...
{35363}{35423}and you can find out about the birth|when you get home.
{35423}{35494}It's available on Betamax,|VHS and Super 8.

{37415}{37457}Were destitute.
{37499}{37535}Come in, my little loves.
{37535}{37628}I've got no option but to sell you all|for scientific experiments.
{37679}{37739}No, no, that's the way it is, my loves.
{37739}{37823}Blame the Catholic Church for|not letting me wear a little rubber thing.
{37823}{37895}Theyve done some|wonderful things in their time.
{37895}{38000}Theyve preserved the might and majesty,|even mystery of the Church of Rome...
{38003}{38110}and the sanctity of the Sacrament,|the indivisible oneness of the Trinity...
{38195}{38255}we wouldn't be in the mess we are now.
{38255}{38328}Couldn't Mummy have worn|some sort of pessary?
{38351}{38459}Not if were going to remain members of|the fastest-growing religion in the world.
{38459}{38495}Hes right.
{38495}{38545}You see, we believe....
{38555}{38606}Let me put it like this.

{45480}{45576}No. Children, I know youre trying to help,|but believe me, my minds made up.
{45576}{45645}I've given this long and careful thought...

{46224}{46260}What are we, dear?
{46260}{46324}Protestant, and fiercely proud of it.
{46332}{46393}Why do they have so many children?
{46404}{46497}Every time they have sexual intercourse|they have to have a baby.
{46500}{46572}- But it's the same with us, Harry.|- What do you mean?
{46572}{46668}I mean weve got two children,|and weve had sexual intercourse twice.
{46692}{46776}That's not the point.|We could have it any time we wanted.
{46776}{46800}Really?
{46800}{46860}Yes. And what's more,|because we dont believe...
{46860}{46932}in all that papist claptrap,|we can take precautions.
{46932}{46980}What you mean, lock the door?
{46980}{47076}No. I mean because were members|of the Protestant Reformed Church...
{47076}{47160}which successfully challenged|the autocratic power of the Papacy...
{47160}{47256}in the mid-16th century, we can wear|little rubber devices to prevent issue.
{47256}{47292}What do you mean?
{47292}{47352}I could, if I wanted,|have sexual intercourse with you.
{47352}{47388}Oh, yes, Harry.
{47388}{47460}And, by wearing a rubber sheath|over my old fellow...
{47460}{47557}I could ensure that when I came off,|you would not be impregnated.
{47568}{47670}That's what being a Protestants all about.|That's why it's the church for me.
{47748}{47832}and the individuals right|to decide for him or herself.
{47832}{47930}When Martin Luther nailed his protest|up to the church door in 1517...
{47940}{48024}he may not have realized|the full significance of what he was doing...
{48024}{48091}but 400 years later, thanks to him...
{48096}{48168}I can wear whatever I want|on my John Thomas.
{48168}{48240}And Protestantism doesn't stop|at the simple condom.
{48240}{48312}Oh, no!|I can wear French Ticklers if I want.
{48312}{48324}What?
{48324}{48398}French Ticklers, black mambos,|crocodile ribs.
{48408}{48468}Sheaths that are designed|not only to protect...
{48468}{48552}but also to enhance|the stimulation of sexual congress.
{48552}{48588}Have you got one?
{48588}{48680}Have I got one? No, but I can go down|the road anytime I want...
{48684}{48780}and walk into Harrys, and hold my head|up high and say, in a loud, steady voice:
{48780}{48840}"Harry, I want you to sell me a condom.
{48840}{48936}"In fact, today I think llI have|a French Tickler, for I am a Protestant".
{48936}{48960}Why dont you?
{48960}{48996}But they cannot.
{48996}{49080}Because their church never made|the leap out of the Middle Ages...
{49080}{49159}and the domination of|alien Episcopal supremacy.
{49164}{49274}But despite the attempts of Protestants|to promote the idea of sex for pleasure...
{49284}{49355}children continue to multiply everywhere.
{49512}{49598}"And spotteth twice|they the camels before the third hour.
{49644}{49722}"And so the Midianites|went forth to Ram Gilead...
{49740}{49788}"in Kadesh Bilgemeth...
{49788}{49836}"by Shor Ethra Regalion...
{49836}{49906}"to the house of Gash-Bil-Bethuel-Bazda.

{50016}{50090}"and the tent peg|to the house of Rashomon.
{50100}{50161}"And there, slew they the goats...
{50172}{50250}"yea, and placed they the bits|in little pots".
{50328}{50378}Here endeth the lesson.
{50388}{50433}Let us praise God.
{50544}{50580}Oh, Lord.
{50592}{50628}Oh, Lord.
{50664}{50706}You are so big.
{50724}{50766}You are so big.
{50796}{50842}So absolutely huge.
{50868}{50914}So absolutely huge.
{50964}{51050}Gosh, were all really impressed|down here, I can tell you.
{51084}{51170}Gosh, were all really impressed|down here, I can tell you.
{51204}{51282}Forgive us, Lord, for this,|our dreadful toadying.
{51324}{51374}And barefaced flattery.
{51396}{51470}But youre so strong,|and, well, just so super.
{51540}{51577}Fantastic.
{51600}{51651}- Amen, Reverend.|- Amen.
{51660}{51708}Now two boys have been found...
{51708}{51785}rubbing linseed oil|into the school cormorant.
{51816}{51888}Some of you may feel|that the cormorant does not play...
{51888}{51984}an important part in the life|of the school, but I would remind you...
{51984}{52080}that it was presented to us by|the corporation of the town of Sudbury...
{52080}{52152}to commemorate Empire Day,|when we try to remember...
{52152}{52224}the names of all those from|the Sudbury area...
{52224}{52284}who so gallantly gave their lives...
{52284}{52336}to keep China British.
{52356}{52440}So from now on,|the cormorant is strictly out of bounds!
{52860}{52918}"Dont grill or toast your flock
{52956}{53011}"Dont put us on the barbecue
{53064}{53113}"Or simmer us in stock
{53172}{53230}"Dont braise or bake or boil us
{53268}{53319}"Or stir-fry us in a wok
{53388}{53448}"Oh, please dont lightly poach us
{53484}{53536}"Or baste us with hot fat
{53592}{53648}"Don't fricassee or roast us
{53712}{53760}"Or boil us in a vat
{53808}{53878}"And please don't stick thy servants, Lord
{53928}{53974}"In a rotissomat"
{54156}{54194}Hes coming!
{54360}{54423}All right, settle down, settle down.
{54468}{54528}Before I begin the lesson,|will those of you...
{54528}{54612}playing in the match this afternoon|move your clothes down...
{54612}{54672}onto the lower peg|immediately after lunch...
{54672}{54744}before you write home,|if youre not getting a haircut...
{54744}{54840}unless you have a brother going out|this weekend as the guest of another boy...
{54840}{54936}then collect his note before lunch,|put it in your letter after your haircut.
{54936}{55023}Make sure he moves your clothes|onto the lower peg for you.
{55032}{55068}- Sir?|- Yes, Wymer?
{55068}{55128}My brothers going out|with Dibble this weekend...
{55128}{55188}but I'm not having my hair cut,|so do I move...
{55188}{55267}I do wish youd listen, Wymer.|It's perfectly simple.
{55272}{55380}If youre not getting your hair cut, you|dont have to move your brothers clothes.
{55380}{55488}You simply collect his note before lunch,|after youve done your scripture prep...
{55488}{55560}when youve written your letter home|before rest...
{55560}{55644}move your clothes onto the lower peg,|greet the visitors...
{55644}{55732}and report to Mr. Vviney|that youve had your chit signed.
{55740}{55776}Now, sex.
{55848}{55904}Sex, sex, sex. Where were we?
{56028}{56112}Well, had I got as far as|the penis entering the vagina?
{56244}{56291}- No, sir.|- No, sir.
{56316}{56369}Well, had I done foreplay?
{56436}{56472}Yes, sir.
{56484}{56574}As we all know all about foreplay,|no doubt you can tell me...
{56580}{56642}what the purpose of foreplay is.
{56676}{56709}Biggs.
{56808}{56857}Dont know. Sorry, sir.
{56868}{56902}Carter?
{56952}{57015}Was it taking your clothes off, sir?
{57036}{57078}And after that?
{57108}{57168}Putting them on a lower peg, sir.
{57204}{57294}The purpose of foreplay is|to cause the vagina to lubricate...
{57312}{57387}so that the penis can penetrate|more easily.
{57408}{57456}Could we open a window, sir?
{57456}{57492}Yes. Harris, will you?
{57492}{57580}And, of course, to cause the mans penis|to erect and harden.
{57660}{57726}Now, did I do vaginal juices last week?
{57780}{57828}Pay attention, Wadsworth!|I know it's Friday.
{57828}{57864}Watching the football?
{57864}{57928}Boy, move over there. I'm warning you.
{57948}{58013}I may decide to set an exam this term.
{58032}{58068}- Oh, sir!|- Sir!
{58068}{58110}So just listen.
{58176}{58244}Now did I or did I not do vaginal juices?
{58344}{58380}Yes, sir.
{58380}{58454}Name two ways|of getting them flowing, Watson.
{58488}{58541}Rubbing the clitoris, sir?
{58632}{58688}What's wrong with a kiss, boy?
{58704}{58770}Why not start her off with a nice kiss?
{58788}{58884}You dont have to leap|straight for the clitoris like a bull at a gate.
{58884}{58932}Give her a kiss, boy.
{58968}{59040}- Suck the nipple, sir?|- Good, good. Well done, Wymer.
{59040}{59119}- Stroking the thighs, sir?|- Yes, yes. I suppose so.
{59124}{59181}- Biting the neck.|- Yes, good.
{59184}{59268}Nibbling the ear lobe, kneading|the buttocks, and so on and so forth.
{59268}{59343}So we have all these|possibilities before we...
{59352}{59420}stampede towards the clitoris, Watson.
{59436}{59484}Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
{59484}{59567}Now, all these forms of stimulation|can now take place.
{59831}{59891}Of course,|tonguing will give you the best idea...
{59891}{59956}of how the juices are coming along.
{59987}{60011}Helen?
{60011}{60095}Now, penetration and coitus,|that is to say, intercourse...
{60095}{60152}up to and including orgasm.
{60203}{60242}Hello, dear.
{60251}{60323}Do stand up when my wife|enters the room, Carter.
{60323}{60359}Sorry, sir.
{60359}{60467}Humphrey, I hope you dont mind. I told|the Garfields wed dine with them tonight.
{60467}{60551}- Yes, well, I suppose we must.|- I said wed be there by 8:00.
{60551}{60623}It'll give me a reason|to wind up the staff meeting.
{60623}{60695}I know you dont like them,|but couldn't make another excuse.
{60695}{60746}It's just that I felt....
{60755}{60788}Wymer!
{60803}{60882}This is for your benefit.|Would you kindly wake up?
{60899}{60976}I've no intention|of going through this all again.
{61223}{61295}Well take the foreplay as read,|if you dont mind, dear.
{61295}{61331}No, of course not.
{61331}{61423}So, the man starts by entering|or mounting his good lady wife...
{61451}{61487}in the standard way.
{61487}{61579}The penis is now, as you will observe,|more or less fully erect.
{61607}{61661}There we are. That's better.
{61667}{61706}Now, Carter.
{61727}{61778}- Yes, sir?|- What is it?
{61823}{61891}- It's an ocarina, sir.|- Bring it up here.
{61919}{62015}The man now starts making|thrusting movements with his pelvic area...
{62015}{62087}moving the penis up and down|inside the vagina.
{62087}{62159}Put it there, boy. Put it there on the table.
{62183}{62255}While the wife maximizes|her clitoral stimulation...
{62255}{62327}by the shaft of the penis|by pushing forward.
{62327}{62351}Thank you, dear.
{62351}{62418}Now, as the sexual excitement mounts....
{62423}{62469}What's funny, Biggs?
{62483}{62507}Nothing, sir.
{62507}{62579}Do, please,|share your little joke with the rest of us.
{62579}{62639}Obviously something|frightfully funny is going on.
{62639}{62675}No, honestly, sir.
{62675}{62759}Well, as it's so funny,|I think youd better be selected to play...
{62759}{62862}for the boys team in the rugby match|against the masters this afternoon.
{62867}{62906}Oh, no, sir!
{63395}{63447}Well played, well played.
{65687}{65771}Blackitt, Sturridge and Walters,|you take the buggers on the left flank.
{65771}{65831}Hordern, Spadger and I'll go|for the gun post.
{65831}{65891}Hang on. You'll never make it.|Let us come.
{65891}{65915}Do as youre told.
{65915}{65966}Right, Skipper. Oh, sir?
{65975}{66031}If we dont meet again, sir...
{66059}{66164}ld just like to say it's been|a real privilege fighting alongside you, sir.
{66167}{66251}Yes, well, this is hardly the time|or place for a good-bye speech.
{66251}{66354}Me and the lads realize that, sir,|but, well, we may never meet again, so...
{66359}{66407}All right, Blackitt. Thanks a lot.
{66407}{66455}No, just a moment, sir.
{66455}{66515}Me and the lads,|weve had a little whip around.
{66515}{66589}Weve bought you something.|We bought you this.
{66659}{66710}I dont know what to say.
{66731}{66806}It's a lovely thought. Thank you.|Thank you all.
{66815}{66879}But I think wed better get to cover...
{66911}{66984}Weve got something else|for you as well, sir.
{67007}{67079}Sorry it's another clock,|only there was a bit of a mix-up.
{67079}{67127}Walters thought he was buyin a present...
{67127}{67206}and Spadger and I|had already got the other one.
{67211}{67281}Well, it's beautiful. Theyre both beautiful.
{67331}{67415}Wed better get to cover now.|I'll thank you properly later on.
{67415}{67463}Corporal Sturridge got this for you.
{67463}{67533}He didn't know about the others.|It's Swiss.
{67535}{67607}Now, that is thoughtful, Sturridge.|Good man.
{67607}{67698}Theres a card, sir, from all of us.|Sorry about the blood, sir.
{67739}{67775}Thank you all.
{67775}{67840}Squad! Three cheers for Captain Biggs.
{68003}{68039}I'll be all right.
{68039}{68129}There's just one other thing, sir.|Spadger, give him the check.
{68135}{68183}This is really going too far.
{68183}{68275}I dont seem to be able to find it, sir.|It'll be in No. 4 trench.
{68279}{68339}For Christs sake, forget it, man.
{68363}{68423}You shouldn't have said that, sir.
{68435}{68471}Youve hurt his feelings now.
{68471}{68544}Dont mind me, Spadge.|Toffs are all the same.
{68567}{68676}One minute, it's all please and thank you.|The next, theyll kick you in the teeth.
{68699}{68778}- Lets not give him the cake.|- I dont want any cake.
{68783}{68855}Look. Blackitt cooked it|especially for you, you bastard.
{68855}{68903}He saved his rations for six weeks, sir.
{68903}{68981}- I dont mean to be ungrateful.|- I'll be all right...
{69011}{69055}Blackie! Blackie!
{69059}{69143}Look at him! He worked on that cake|like no one else I've ever known.
{69143}{69203}Some nights it was so cold|we could hardly move...
{69203}{69299}but Blackittd be slicing the lemons,|mixing the sugar and the almonds.
{69299}{69391}I mean, you try getting butter to melt|at 15 degrees below zero.
{69395}{69484}Theres love in that cake.|This mans love and this mans care...
{69575}{69632}- Oh, my Christ!|- You bastard.
{69683}{69742}All right, we will eat the cake.
{69755}{69828}Theyre right.|It's too good a cake not to eat.
{69839}{69911}- Get the plates and knives, Walters.|- Yes, sir. How many?
{69911}{69942}Six.
{69983}{70019}Better make it five.
{70019}{70090}- Tablecloth, sir?|- Yes, get the tablecloth.
{70139}{70187}No, no, I'll get the tablecloth.
{70187}{70257}You better get the gate-leg table, Hordern.
{70259}{70319}- And the little lamp, sir?|- Yes.
{70319}{70367}While youre at it, youd better get a doily.
{70367}{70427}I'll bring two in case one gets crumpled.
{70427}{70459}Okay!
{70547}{70630}But, of course, warfare isn't all fun.|Right. Stop that.
{70631}{70715}It's all very well to laugh at the military,|but when one considers...
{70715}{70811}the meaning of life, it's a struggle|between alternative viewpoints of life.
{70811}{70883}Without the ability to defend|ones own viewpoint...
{70883}{70943}against other|more aggressive ideologies...
{70943}{71038}then reasonableness and|moderation could quite simply disappear.
{71055}{71115}That is why well always need an army.
{71115}{71190}May God strike me down|were it to be otherwise.
{71295}{71343}Dont stand there gawping...
{71343}{71403}like youve never seen|the hand of God before!
{71403}{71491}Now, today were going to do|marching up and down the square.
{71523}{71606}That is, unless any of youve got|anything better to do.
{71631}{71663}Well?
{71679}{71751}Anyone got anything|theyd rather be doing...
{71751}{71817}than marchin up and down the square?
{71883}{71924}Yes! Atkinson.
{71991}{72059}What would you rather be doing, Atkinson?
{72111}{72207}To be quite honest, Sarge,|ld rather be home with the wife and kids.
{72243}{72284}Would you now?
{72303}{72339}Yes, Sarge.
{72339}{72384}Right. Off you go.
{72387}{72418}Now.
{72435}{72505}Everybody else happy with my little plan...
{72507}{72567}of marching up and down|the square a bit?
{72567}{72603}- Sarge?|- Yes?
{72603}{72699}- I've got a book ld quite like to read.|- Go read your book then. Now!
{72735}{72804}Everybody else quite content to join in...
{72843}{72930}with my little scheme|of marchin up and down the square?
{72987}{73020}Sarge?
{73035}{73083}Yes, Wyclif, what is it?
{73083}{73138}Well, I'm learning the piano.
{73167}{73213}Learning the piano?
{73227}{73263}Yes, Sarge.
{73263}{73328}And I suppose you want to go practice?
{73359}{73442}Marchin up and down the square|not good enough for you?
{73455}{73510}- Well...|- Right! Off you go!
{73515}{73574}Now, what about the rest of you?
{73623}{73687}Rather be at the pictures, I suppose.
{73767}{73816}All right! Off you go!
{73911}{73971}Bloody army.|I dont know what it's coming to.
{73971}{74053}Right. Sergeant Major|marching up and down the square.
{74079}{74172}Democracy and humanitarianism|are trademarks of the British Army.
{74175}{74210}Rubbish!
{74211}{74312}And have stamped it's triumph|in the furthest flung corners of the Empire.
{74715}{74799}But no matter where or when|there was fighting to be done...
{74799}{74892}it has always been|the calm leadership of the officer class...
{74895}{74968}that has made the British Army|what it is.
{75807}{75844}Excuse me.
{75999}{76079}- Morning, Ainsworth.|- Morning, Pakenham. Sleep well?
{76083}{76143}Not bad. Bitten to shreds, though.
{76143}{76203}Must be that hole|in the bloody mosquito net.
{76203}{76271}Yes, savage little blighters, arent they?
{76287}{76323}- Excuse me, sir.|- Yes, Chadwick?
{76323}{76395}I'm afraid Perkins got badly bitten|during the night.
{76395}{76431}So did we.
{76431}{76503}Yes, but I do think Doctor|ought to see him.
{76503}{76575}- Well, go and fetch him then.|- Right you are, sir.
{76575}{76635}Suppose ld better go along.|Coming, Pakenham?
{76635}{76680}Yes, I suppose so.
{76743}{76783}Come on, boy.
{76995}{77055}- Morning, Perkins.|- Morning, sir.
{77055}{77103}What's all the trouble, then?
{77103}{77160}Bitten, sir. During the night.
{77211}{77261}- Whole leg gone?|- Yes.
{77283}{77340}- Hows it feel?|- Stings a bit.
{77355}{77409}Well, it would, wouldn't it?
{77415}{77477}That's quite a bite youve got there.
{77499}{77583}- Yes. A real beauty, isn't it?|- Any idea how it happened?
{77595}{77655}None whatsoever.|Complete mystery to me.
{77655}{77718}Woke up just now, one sock too many.
{77727}{77811}- Must have a hell of a hole in your net.|- Weve sent for the doctor.
{77811}{77883}- Hardly worth it, is it?|- Yes. Better safe than sorry.
{77883}{77931}Yes. Good Lord, look at this.
{77931}{77982}By Jove! That's enormous.
{77991}{78051}You dont think it'll come back, do you?
{78051}{78087}- For more, you mean?|- Yes.
{78087}{78135}- Wed better get it stitched.|- Right.
{78135}{78159}Hello, doc!
{78159}{78239}Morning. I came as fast as I could.|Is something up?
{78267}{78363}Yes. During the night,|old Perkins got his leg bitten, sort of, off.
{78387}{78446}Yeah. Been in the wars, have we?
{78471}{78502}Yes.
{78507}{78565}Any headache? Bowels all right?
{78579}{78661}Well, lets have a look at|this one leg of yours, then.
{78687}{78723}Yes. Yes.
{78795}{78864}Yes, well, this is nothing to worry about.
{78867}{78891}Good.
{78891}{78987}Theres a lot of it about. Probably a virus.|Keep warm, plenty of rest...
{78987}{79071}and if youre playing football or anything,|try and favor the other leg.
{79071}{79095}Right.
{79095}{79155}As right as rain in a couple of days.
{79155}{79239}- Thanks for the reassurance.|- Not at all. That's what I'm here for.
{79239}{79311}Any other problems|I can reassure you about?
{79311}{79335}No, I'm fine.
{79335}{79392}Jolly good. Well, must be off.
{79395}{79466}So it'll just grow back again, then, will it?
{79563}{79635}I think ld better come clean with you|about this.
{79635}{79689}It's not a virus, I'm afraid.
{79743}{79827}You see, a virus is what we doctors call|very, very small.
{79827}{79911}So small it could not possibly|have made off with a whole leg.
{79911}{79995}What were looking for,|this is no more than an educated guess...
{79995}{80079}ld like to make that clear,|is some multicellular life form...
{80079}{80171}with stripes, huge, razor-sharp teeth,|about 11-foot long...
{80187}{80235}and of the genus felis horribilis.
{80235}{80301}What we doctors, in fact, call a tiger.
{80331}{80366}A tiger?
{80379}{80414}A tiger?
{80523}{80568}A tiger in Africa?
{80571}{80616}A tiger in Africa?
{80667}{80761}- It's probably escaped from a zoo.|- Doesn't sound very likely to me.
{80775}{80811}Sir! Sir!
{80811}{80883}The attacks over, sir.|The Zulus are retreating.
{80883}{80919}Jolly good.
{80919}{81003}Quite a lot of casualties, sir.|C-division wiped out. Signals gone.
{81003}{81051}- Thirty men killed in F-section.|- I see.
{81051}{81123}I should think|about 150 men altogether, sir.
{81123}{81147}Jolly good.
{81147}{81231}I havent got the final figures,|but theres a lot of seriously wounded...
{81231}{81320}Yes, the thing is, Sergeant,|I've got a bit of a problem here.
{81363}{81425}One of the officers has lost a leg.
{81435}{81509}- Oh, no, sir!|- I'm afraid so. Probably a tiger.
{81543}{81580}In Africa?
{81591}{81675}The M.O. says we can stitch it back on|if we can find it immediately.
{81675}{81778}- Right, sir. I'll organize a party.|- It's hardly the time for that, Sergeant.
{81807}{81870}- A search party.|- Much better idea.
{82011}{82035}Sorry about the mess.
{82035}{82107}Well try to clear it up|by the time you get back.
{82107}{82155}- We showed em, didn't we, sir?|- Yes.
{82155}{82215}We got a search party. Leave that alone.
{82215}{82287}All this killing, bloodshed,|bloody good fun, sir, isn't it?
{82287}{82311}Yes, very good.
{82311}{82383}- Morning, sir.|- Nasty wound youve got there, fella.
{82383}{82435}Thank you very much, sir.
{82455}{82526}Come on, Private.|Making up a search party.
{82539}{82599}Better than staying home, isn't it?
{82599}{82659}At home if you kill someone,|they arrest you.
{82659}{82719}Here, they give you a gun|and show you what to do.
{82719}{82813}I mean, I killed 15 of those buggers, sir.|At home, theyd hang me.
{82827}{82896}Here, theyll give me a fucking medal, sir.
{83307}{83345}Sorry, sir.
{83355}{83392}Thank you.
{83811}{83843}Look!
{83895}{83939}My God! It's huge!
{84183}{84252}Dont shoot. Dont shoot.|Were not a tiger.
{84267}{84310}We were just....
{84339}{84397}Why are you dressed as a tiger?
{84447}{84523}- Oh, why, why, why?|- Isn't it a lovely day today?
{84531}{84578}Answer the question.
{84591}{84676}- We were just...|- Well, were dressed like this because....
{84735}{84771}No, that's not it.
{84771}{84843}We did it for a laugh.|Part of a spree. High spirits.
{84843}{84908}- Simple as that.|- Nothing more to it.
{84915}{84996}Actually, were on a mission|for British intelligence.
{84999}{85077}- Theres a pro-tsarist Ashanti Chief...|- No, no, no.
{85095}{85167}- No, no, no.|- No. Were doing it for an advertisement.
{85167}{85227}That's it. Forget about the Russians.
{85227}{85287}Were doing an advert|for Tiger Brand Coffee.
{85287}{85383}"Tiger brand coffee is a real treat.|Even tigers prefer a cup of it to real meat".
{85383}{85442}- Now, look...|- All right, all right.
{85442}{85538}We are dressed as a tiger because|he has an auntie who did it in 1839.
{85538}{85598}- This is the 50th anniversary.|- Were doing it for a bet.
{85598}{85691}- God told us to do it.|- To tell the truth, we are completely mad.
{85694}{85766}Were inmates|of a Bengali Psychiatric lnstitution...
{85766}{85863}and we escaped by making this skin|out of old used cereal packets.
{85874}{85927}- It doesn't matter!|- What?
{85934}{86006}It doesn't matter|why theyre dressed as a tiger.
{86006}{86054}Have they got my leg?
{86066}{86123}Good thinking. Well, have you?
{86138}{86183}- Actually...|- Yes?
{86186}{86234}We were thinking|of training as taxidermists.
{86234}{86306}We wanted the feel|from the animals point of view.
{86306}{86399}Quiet! Now look, were just asking you|if youve got this mans leg.
{86438}{86498}- A wooden leg?|- No, no, a proper leg.
{86498}{86594}He was fast asleep, and someone|or something came in and removed it.
{86642}{86691}Without waking him up?
{86726}{86780}- Yes.|- I dont believe you.
{86786}{86846}We found the tiger skin|in a bicycle shop in Cairo.
{86846}{86906}The owner wanted it|taken to Dar es Salaam.
{86906}{86990}Shut up! Now look,|have you or have you not got his leg?
{87014}{87060}- Yes. No.|- No, no.
{87146}{87205}- Why did you say yes?|- I didn't.
{87206}{87255}I'm not talking to you.
{87422}{87475}Right. Search the thicket.
{87482}{87578}Come on. Do we look like the sort of|chaps whod creep into a camp at night...
{87578}{87662}steal into someones tent,|anesthetize them, tissue-type em...
{87662}{87722}amputate a leg and run away with it?
{87722}{87768}Search the thicket.
{87782}{87830}Leg! Youre looking for a leg!
{87830}{87902}Actually, I think there is one|in there somewhere.
{87902}{87974}Someone mustve abandoned it here,|knowing youd come after it.
{87974}{88058}We stumbled across it, actually.|They'll be miles away by now.
{88058}{88136}I expect welI have to take|all the blame as usual.
{88154}{88240}Hello, good evening and welcome to|The Middle of the Film.
{88418}{88478}Hello, and welcome to|The Middle of the Film...
{88478}{88538}the moment where we take a break|to invite you...
{88538}{88614}to join us, the filmmakers,|in Find the Fish.
{88658}{88718}Were going to show you|a scene from another film...
{88718}{88778}and ask you to guess where the fish is.
{88778}{88850}But if you think you know,|dont keep it to yourselves.
{88850}{88910}Yell out so that all the cinema|can hear you.
{88910}{88971}So here we are with Find the Fish.
{89222}{89283}I wonder where that fish has gone.
{89318}{89354}You did love it so.
{89354}{89412}You looked after it like a son.
{89438}{89495}And it went wherever I did go.
{89546}{89603}- Is it in the cupboard?|- Yes!
{89630}{89712}Wouldn't you like to know?|It was a lovely little fish.
{89738}{89795}And it went wherever I did go.
{89858}{89932}- It's behind the sofa!|- Where can that fish be?
{89966}{90026}Have you thought of the drawers|in the bureau?
{90026}{90079}It is a most elusive fish.
{90098}{90155}And it went wherever I did go.
{90230}{90283}Fishy, fishy, fishy, fish.
{90302}{90349}Fish, fish, fish....
{90458}{90511}Fishy, fishy, fishy, fish!
{90530}{90585}That went wherever I did go.
{90638}{90713}- Look up his trunk!|- Yeah! It's in his trousers!
{90722}{90782}- That was terrific!|- Great! Yeah!
{90782}{90839}- Best bit so far.|- Fantastic!
{90866}{90912}Really risky, yeah.
{91010}{91094}They havent said much about|the meaning of life so far, have they?
{91094}{91154}- Well, it's been building up to it.|- Has it?
{91154}{91219}Yeah, I expect theyll get onto it now.
{91226}{91336}Personally, I doubt theyre going to say|anything about the meaning of life at all.
{91346}{91406}- They've gotta say something.|- Theyre bound to.
{91406}{91438}Yeah.
{91526}{91610}- What do you think the next bit will be?|- Caption, I expect.
{91610}{91689}About the next stage of life, you mean?|Here we go.
{91730}{91776}Couldve guessed it.
{91910}{91958}That's much better. Thank you, honey.
{91958}{91999}Youre welcome.
{92030}{92101}It was all sort of misty before. That's fine.
{92126}{92189}- Hey! How are you?|- Were just fine.
{92210}{92270}What kind of food|would you like this evening?
{92270}{92318}We sort of like pineapple.
{92318}{92369}Yeah, we love pineapple.
{92378}{92450}Yeah, anything with pineapple|in it is great for us.
{92450}{92504}How about the Dungeon Room?
{92522}{92594}- That sounds fine.|- Sure is. It's real Hawaiian food...
{92594}{92684}served in an authentic|medieval-English-dungeon atmosphere.
{93074}{93116}Isn't this nice?
{93134}{93172}How are ya?
{93194}{93230}Take a little Kodak.
{93230}{93288}Thank you. Thank you very much.
{93602}{93686}Good evening. Would you care for|something to talk about?
{93686}{93775}- That would be wonderful.|- Our special tonight is minorities.
{93782}{93838}That sounds real interesting.
{93854}{93902}What's this conversation here?
{93902}{93998}That's football. You can talk about|the Steelers-Bears game Saturday...
{93998}{94070}or you could reminisce|about really great World Series.
{94070}{94094}No, no.
{94094}{94164}- What is this one here?|- That's philosophy.
{94190}{94233}Is that a sport?
{94238}{94328}No, it's more of an attempt|to construct a viable hypothesis...
{94334}{94394}to explain the meaning of life.
{94394}{94454}- What was that?|- What's he saying?
{94454}{94502}That sounds wonderful.
{94502}{94586}Would you like to talk about|the meaning of life, darling?
{94586}{94622}Sure. Why not?
{94622}{94678}- Philosophy for two?|- Right.
{94682}{94718}- Room?|- 259.
{94718}{94749}259.
{94814}{94850}How do we...?
{94850}{94910}You folks want me to start you off?
{94910}{94946}Wed appreciate that.
{94946}{94978}Okay!
{95006}{95083}Look. Have you ever wondered|just why youre here?
{95138}{95222}We went to Miami last year|and California the year before...
{95222}{95300}No, no, no. I mean,|why were here, on this planet.
{95390}{95420}No.
{95426}{95504}Right. You ever wanted to know|what it's all about?
{95522}{95554}Nope.
{95570}{95606}Righty-ho!
{95606}{95699}See, throughout history,|there have been certain men and women...
{95714}{95808}whove tried to find|the solution to the mysteries of existence.
{95822}{95895}- Great!|- And we call these guys philosophers.
{95906}{95966}- And that's what were talking about.|- Right!
{95966}{95990}That's neat.
{95990}{96092}You look youre getting the idea,|so I'll give you these conversation cards.
{96110}{96218}They'll tell you a little about philosophical|method, names of famous philosophers.
{96218}{96242}There you are.
{96242}{96318}- Have a nice conversation.|- Thank you very much.
{96326}{96391}- Hes cute.|- Yeah, real understanding.
{96434}{96506}I never knew Schopenhauer was|a philosopher.
{96542}{96612}Yeah. Hes the one that begins|with an "S".
{96794}{96836}Like Nietzsche.
{96878}{96940}Does "Nietzsche" begin with an "S"?
{96974}{97030}Theres an "S" in "Nietzsche".
{97070}{97111}Yes, there is.
{97154}{97214}Do all philosophers have an "S" in them?
{97214}{97271}Yeah. I think most of them do.
{97322}{97395}Does that mean Selina Jones|is a philosopher?
{97406}{97442}Yeah! Right!
{97442}{97520}She could be.|She sings about the meaning of life.
{97526}{97571}Yeah. That's right.
{97586}{97646}But I dont think she writes|her own material.
{97646}{97676}No.
{97682}{97748}Maybe Schopenhauer writes her material.
{97754}{97810}No. Burt Bacharach writes it.
{97850}{97910}Theres no "S" in "Burt Bacharach".
{97910}{97955}Or in "Hal David".
{97970}{98012}Whos Hal David?
{98018}{98090}He writes the lyrics.|Burt just writes the tunes.
{98090}{98161}Only now,|hes married to Carol Beyer Seger.
{98258}{98326}Waiter? This conversation isn't very good.
{98330}{98371}I'm sorry, sir.
{98402}{98462}We do have one today|that's not on the menu.
{98462}{98561}It's sort of a specialty of the house,|you know? Live organ transplants.
{98570}{98632}Live organ transplants? What's that?
{98870}{98926}Dont worry, dear. I'll get it.
{99098}{99163}- Yes?|- Hello. Can we have your liver?
{99182}{99229}- What?|- Your liver.
{99254}{99326}It's a large glandular organ|in your abdomen.
{99372}{99437}You know, it's reddish-brown, sort of...
{99444}{99519}Yeah, yeah, I know what it is,|but I'm using it.
{99600}{99660}Come on, sir. Dont muck us about.
{99708}{99741}Hello!
{99780}{99840}- What's this, then?|- A liver donors card.
{99840}{99891}- Need we say more?|- No.
{99900}{99993}Listen, I can't give it you now.|It says, "in the event of death".
{99996}{100020}My God!
{100020}{100109}No one has ever had their liver taken out|by us and survived.
{100116}{100186}Just lie there, sir. It wont take a minute.
{100512}{100560}Here. What's going on?
{100560}{100617}Hes donating his liver, madam.
{100632}{100713}Is this because he took out|one of those silly cards?
{100716}{100781}- That's right, madam.|- Typical of him.
{100788}{100872}He goes down to the public library,|sees a few signs up...
{100872}{100941}comes home all full of good intentions.
{100956}{101043}He gives blood, does cold research,|all that sort of thing.
{101136}{101200}What do you do with them all, anyway?
{101208}{101256}They all go to saving lives, madam.
{101256}{101292}That's what he used to say.
{101292}{101374}"It's all for the good of the country",|he used to say.
{101400}{101477}Do you think it's all|for the good of the country?
{101484}{101544}Do you think it's all|for the good of the country?
{101544}{101641}I wouldn't know about that, madam.|Were just doing our jobs, you know?
{101664}{101715}Youre not doctors, then?
{101760}{101798}Blimey, no.
{101832}{101909}Mum, Dad, I'm off out now.|I'll see you about 7:00?
{101916}{101975}Right, son. Look after yourself.
{102096}{102146}You fancy a cup of tea?
{102204}{102261}Thatd be very nice. Thank you.
{102276}{102330}Thank you very much, madam.
{102384}{102436}I thought shed never ask.
{102528}{102585}You do realize he has to be...
{102624}{102686}dead by the terms of the card...
{102708}{102756}before he donates his liver.
{102756}{102839}I told him that, but he never listens to me,|silly man.
{102852}{102904}I mean, I was wonderin...
{102924}{102994}what you was thinkin of doin after that.
{102996}{103056}I mean will you stay on your own?
{103068}{103138}Or is there, well, someone else, sort of...
{103212}{103257}on the horizon?
{103260}{103340}I'm too old for that sort of thing.|I'm past my prime.
{103344}{103406}Not at all. Vvery attractive woman.
{103428}{103516}Well, I'm certainly not thinking|of getting hitched up again.
{103548}{103589}- Sure?|- Sure.
{103800}{103848}Can we have your liver then?
{103848}{103893}I would be scared.
{103896}{103933}All right.
{103956}{104001}I'll tell you what.
{104016}{104058}Listen to this.
{104088}{104155}"Whenever life gets you down, Mrs. Brown
{104160}{104217}"And things seem hard or tough
{104244}{104312}"And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft
{104364}{104432}"And you feel that youve had quite enough
{104568}{104657}"Just remember that youre standing|on a planet that's evolving
{104724}{104786}"And revolving at 900 miles an hour
{104808}{104886}"It's orbiting at 19 miles a second|So it's reckoned
{104904}{104973}"A sun that is the source of all our power
{105000}{105085}"The sun and you and me|And all the stars that we can see
{105096}{105159}"Are moving at a million miles a day
{105192}{105267}"In an outer spiral arm|at 40,000 miles an hour
{105288}{105351}"Of the galaxy we call the Milky Way
{105576}{105648}"Our galaxy itself contains 100 billion stars
{105672}{105738}"It's a 100,000 light years side to side
{105768}{105845}"It bulges in the middle|16,000 light years thick
{105864}{105939}"But out by us,|it's just 3,000 light years wide
{105960}{106040}"Were 30,000 light years|from galactic central point
{106044}{106107}"We go round every 200 million years
{106152}{106231}"And our galaxy is only|one of millions of billions

{107100}{107181}"The universe itself|keeps on expanding and expanding

{107388}{107472}"Twelve million miles a minute|and that's the fastest speed there is
{107472}{107555}"So remember when youre feeling|very small and insecure
{107580}{107644}"How amazingly unlikely is your birth
{107676}{107760}"And pray that theres intelligent life|somewhere up in space
{107760}{107832}"Cause theres bugger all|down here on earth"
{107964}{108024}Makes you feel so insignificant, doesn't it?
{108024}{108056}Yeah.
{108132}{108188}Can we have your liver, then?
{108192}{108267}- Yeah, all right. You talked me into it.|- Eric!
{108480}{108552}Which brings us, once again,|to the urgent realization...
{108552}{108627}of just how much there is|still left to own.
{108648}{108720}Item 6 on the agenda:|"The Meaning of Life".
{108828}{108888}Now, Harry,|youve had some thoughts on this.
{108888}{108971}I've had a team working on this|over the past few weeks.
{108972}{109066}What weve come up with can be reduced|to two fundamental concepts.
{109092}{109159}One: people are not wearing enough hats.
{109176}{109225}Two: matter is energy.
{109248}{109356}In the universe, there are many energy|fields which we cannot normally perceive.
{109380}{109476}Some energies have a spiritual source|which act upon a persons soul.
{109500}{109574}However,|this soul does not exist ab initio...
{109596}{109659}as orthodox Christianity teaches.
{109668}{109772}It has to be brought into existence|by a process of guided self-observation.
{109812}{109896}However, this is rarely achieved|owing to mans unique ability...
{109896}{109986}to be distracted from spiritual matters|by everyday trivia.
{110100}{110158}What was that about hats again?
{110196}{110244}People arent wearing enough.
{110244}{110280}Is this true?
{110280}{110376}Certainly. Hat sales have increased,|but not pari passu as our research...
{110376}{110436}When you say "enough",|enough for what purpose?
{110436}{110508}Can I just ask,|with reference to your second point...
{110508}{110607}when you say souls dont develop|because people become distracted....
{110664}{110738}Has anyone noticed|that building there before?
{110784}{110816}What?
{110820}{110857}Good Lord!
{111336}{111373}Good Lord!
{111384}{111443}The Crimson Permanent Assurance!
{111504}{111588}We interrupt this film to apologize|for this unwarranted attack...
{111588}{111624}by the supporting feature.
{111624}{111696}Luckily, we have been prepared|for this eventuality...
{111696}{111764}and are now taking steps to remedy it.
{111780}{111817}Thank you.
{111960}{112063}Good evening. Heres a little number|I tossed off recently in the Caribbean.
{112068}{112132}"Isn't it awfully nice to have a penis
{112140}{112207}"Isn't it frightfully good to have a dong
{112212}{112292}"It's swell to have a stiffy|It's divine to own a dick
{112296}{112380}"From the tiniest little tadger|to the worlds biggest prick

{114838}{114918}The hare is very high,|and the sauce is very rich...
{114946}{115034}with truffles, anchovies,|Grand Marnier, bacon and cream.

{115474}{115546}Et maintenant,|would monsieur care for an aperitif...
{115546}{115619}or would he prefer|to order straight away?
{115630}{115702}Today, we have for appetizers....|Excuse me.
{115774}{115874}Moules marinieres, pate de foie gras,|beluga caviar, eggs benedictine...

{116050}{116140}C"est-a-dire, little quails eggs|on a bed of pureed mushrooms.
{116146}{116194}It's very delicate, very succulent.
{116194}{116238}I'll have the lot.
{116266}{116314}A wise choice, monsieur.
{116314}{116415}And now, how would you like it served?|All mixed up together in a bucket?
{116422}{116470}Yeah. With the eggs on top.
{116470}{116560}- But of course. Avec les ceufs frits.|- Dont skimp on the pate.
{116566}{116650}I assure you. Just because it's mixed up|with all the other things...
{116650}{116722}we wouldn't give you|less than the fulI amount.
{116722}{116813}In fact, I will personally make sure|you have a double helping.
{116830}{116890}Maintenant, quelque chose a boire.|Something to drink?
{116890}{116966}Yeah, I'll have six bottles|of Chateau-Latour 45.
{116998}{117058}And a double jeroboam of champagne.
{117058}{117115}Bon. And the usual brown ales?
{117118}{117216}Yeah. No, wait a minute. I think|I could only manage six crates today.
{117226}{117302}I hope monsieur was not|overdoing it last night.
{117310}{117358}- Shut up!|- D'accord.
{117382}{117447}The new bucket and the cleaning woman.
{117610}{117706}- Is there something wrong with the food?|- No, the food was excellent.
{117706}{117788}- Youre not happy with the service?|- No, no complaints.
{117790}{117879}It's just that we have to go.|I'm having rather a heavy period.
{117910}{117966}And we have a train to catch.
{117982}{118050}Yes, of course. We have a train to catch.
{118054}{118135}And I dont want to start bleeding|all over the seats.
{118150}{118214}- Madam?|- Perhaps we should be going?
{118258}{118346}Vvery well, monsieur. Thank you so much.|So nice to see you.
{118378}{118450}I hope very much|we will see you again very soon.
{118450}{118498}Au revoir, messieurs.
{118498}{118572}Oh, dear. I have trodden|in monsieur"s bucket.
{118666}{118721}Another bucket for monsieur!
{118774}{118820}And perhaps a hose.
{118906}{118949}Oh, Max. Really!
{119350}{119414}Finally, monsieur, a wafer-thin mint.
{119446}{119511}Sir, it's only a tiny, little thin one.
{119530}{119587}- No, fuck off. I'm full.|- Sir.
{119650}{119697}It's only wafer thin.
{119722}{119801}I couldn't eat another thing.|I'm absolutely stuffed.
{119830}{119865}Bug off.
{119866}{119917}Sir, just one. Just one.
{119998}{120072}- All right. Just one.|- Just the one, monsieur.
{120118}{120151}Voila.
{120274}{120313}Bon appetit.
{121330}{121405}Thank you, monsieur,|and now, heres your check.
{122194}{122268}You know, Maria,|I sometimes wonder if well...
{122302}{122370}ever discover the meaning of it all...
{122374}{122433}working in a place like this.
{122434}{122521}Well, I've worked in worse places,|philosophically speaking.
{122530}{122554}Really, Maria?
{122554}{122585}Yes.
{122602}{122670}I used to work in the Academie francaise.
{122686}{122746}But it didn't do me any good at all.
{122746}{122828}I once worked in the library|in the Prado in Madrid...
{122866}{122935}but it didn't teach me nothin, I recall.
{122962}{123058}And the Library of Congress|youd have thought would hold some key...
{123082}{123164}but it didn't, and neither did|the Bodleian Library.
{123190}{123267}In the British Museum,|I hoped to find some clue.
{123310}{123401}I worked there from 9:00 til 6:00,|read every volume through...
{123430}{123511}but it didn't teach me nothing|about lifes mystery.
{123538}{123626}I just kept getting older,|and it got more difficult to see.
{123646}{123729}Til eventually, me eyes went,|and me arthritis got bad.
{123766}{123824}So now, I'm cleaning up in here.
{123874}{123928}But I can't be really sad...
{123934}{124004}cause you see, I feel that lifes a game.
{124018}{124073}You sometimes win or lose...
{124090}{124157}and though I may be down right now...
{124162}{124222}at least I dont work for Jews.
{124354}{124390}I'm so sorry.
{124390}{124460}I had no idea we had a racist working here.
{124498}{124563}I apologize most sincerely. I mean....
{124642}{124708}Where are you going? No, I can explain.
{124810}{124849}As for me...
{124870}{124958}if you want to know what I think,|I'll show you something.
{125014}{125079}- Come with me.|- I was saying that....
{125122}{125167}- Hello?|- Come on.
{125182}{125215}Hello?
{125302}{125338}This way.
{125446}{125494}Come on. Dont be shy.
{125518}{125572}Mind the stairs, all right?
{125686}{125744}I think this will help explain.
{125914}{125952}Come along.
{126022}{126059}Over here.
{126322}{126366}Come on. Come on.
{126478}{126514}This way.
{126610}{126645}Come on.
{126730}{126766}This way.
{126814}{126852}Stay by me?
{126922}{126966}Nearly there now.
{127210}{127250}You see that?
{127306}{127356}That's where I was born.
{127414}{127461}You know, one day...
{127474}{127553}my mother put me on her knee|and she said to me:
{127594}{127637}"Gaston, my son.
{127654}{127713}"The world is a beautiful place.
{127750}{127816}"You must go into it and love everyone.
{127882}{127939}"Try to make everyone happy...
{127954}{128037}"and bring peace and contentment|everywhere you go".
{128098}{128146}So I became a waiter.
{128362}{128426}It's not much of a philosophy, I know.
{128542}{128630}Fuck you. I can live my own life|in my own way if I want to.
{128662}{128698}Fuck off.
{128758}{128807}Dont come followin me!
{129679}{129731}This man is about to die.
{129739}{129808}In a few moments now, he will be killed...
{129811}{129883}for Arthur Jarrett|is a convicted criminal...
{129883}{129977}who has been allowed to choose|the manner of his own execution.
{130063}{130102}There he is!
{130459}{130535}Arthur Charles Herbert Runcie|Macadam Jarrett...
{130591}{130677}you have been convicted|by 12 good persons, and true...
{130687}{130783}of the crime of first degree|making of gratuitous sexist jokes...
{130807}{130857}in a moving picture.
{131755}{131813}"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust".
{131923}{131981}It's no good. I just can't go on.
{132019}{132065}I'm no good anymore.
{132091}{132139}I want to end it all!
{132151}{132197}Good-bye! Good-bye!
{132415}{132453}Oh, my God!
{132475}{132509}Oh, no!
{132535}{132599}What'll I do? I can't live without him!
{132751}{132807}- Mummy!|- Mum, where are you?
{132811}{132851}Daddy? Mummy?
{132883}{132916}Mummy?
{134515}{134546}Yes?
{134587}{134636}Is it about the hedge?
{134695}{134770}- I'm awfully sorry, but...|- I am the Grim Reaper.
{134791}{134815}Who?
{134815}{134873}- The Grim Reaper.|- Yes, I see.
{134887}{134925}I am death.
{134959}{135043}Well, we have some people|from America for dinner tonight...
{135043}{135103}- Who is it, darling?|- A Mr. Death or something.
{135103}{135187}Hes come about the reaping?|I dont think we need any now.
{135187}{135271}Hello. Dont leave him|hanging around outside. Ask him in.
{135271}{135355}- I dont think it's quite the moment.|- Do come in. Come and have a drink.
{135355}{135394}Do. Come on.
{135475}{135545}It's one of the little men from the village.
{135559}{135605}Do come in. Please.
{135619}{135691}This is Howard Katzenberg|from Philadelphia.
{135703}{135767}- And his wife, Debbie.|- Hello there.
{135787}{135859}And these are the Portland Smythes,|Jeremy and Fiona.
{135859}{135883}Good evening.
{135883}{135928}This is Mr. Death.
{136099}{136174}- Well, do get Mr. Death a drink, darling.|- Yes.
{136195}{136244}Mr. Death is a reaper.
{136255}{136298}The Grim Reaper.
{136339}{136400}Hardly surprising in this weather.
{136459}{136519}So you still reap around here, do you,|Mr. Death?
{136519}{136567}I am the Grim Reaper.
{136639}{136721}That's about all he says.|Theres your drink, Mr. Death.
{136723}{136747}Do sit down.
{136747}{136847}We were just talking about some|of the awful problems facing the third...
{136939}{137023}Would you prefer white?|I'm afraid we dont have any beer.
{137035}{137088}The Stiltons awfully good.
{137107}{137157}I am not of this world.
{137299}{137336}Good Lord.
{137347}{137385}I am death.
{137515}{137551}Isn't that extraordinary?
{137551}{137611}We were talking about death|five minutes ago.
{137611}{137696}Yes, we were. You know,|whether death is really the end...
{137707}{137767}As my husband Howard here feels,|or whether there is...
{137767}{137839}and one hates to use|words like "soul" or "spirit"...
{137839}{137899}- What other words can one use?|- Exactly.
{137899}{137948}You do not understand.
{138031}{138076}No. Obviously not.
{138079}{138151}- I'll tell you something, Mr. Death.|- You dont...
{138151}{138223}I'd like to express|on behaIf of everybody here...
{138223}{138271}what a really unique experience this is.
{138271}{138351}- Hear, hear.|- Were so delighted that you dropped in.
{138367}{138457}- Can I just finish, please?|- Mr. Death. Is there an afterlife?
{138511}{138595}- If you could wait, please...|- You sure you wouldn't like some sherry...
{138595}{138655}Angela, I'd like to say this, please.
{138655}{138715}- Quiet!|- Can I just say this, please?
{138715}{138771}Silence! I have come for you.
{138883}{138941}- You mean to...|- Take you away.
{139027}{139073}That is my purpose.
{139135}{139173}I am death.
{139279}{139366}Well, that's cast rather a gloom|over the evening, hasn't it?
{139435}{139507}a potentially positive|learning experience that can...
{139507}{139565}Shut up! Shut up, you American.
{139579}{139637}You always talk, you Americans.
{139663}{139724}You talk and you talk and you say:
{139735}{139819}"Let me tell you something"|and "I just wanna say this".
{139855}{139915}Well, youre dead now, so shut up!
{139951}{139992}- Dead?|- Dead.
{140047}{140099}- All of us?|- All of you.
{140191}{140275}Now look here. You barge in here|quite uninvited, break glasses...
{140275}{140347}then announce quite casually|that were all dead.
{140347}{140419}ld remind you|that youre a guest in this house...
{140419}{140455}Be quiet!
{140455}{140524}Englishmen!|Youre all so fucking pompous!
{140575}{140633}None of you have got any balls.
{140671}{140732}- Can I ask you a question?|- What?
{140743}{140813}How can we all have died|at the same time?
{141127}{141172}The salmon mousse.
{141211}{141285}Darling, you didn't use canned salmon,|did you?
{141295}{141353}I'm most dreadfully embarrassed.
{141391}{141440}Now the time has come.
{141499}{141533}Follow.
{141571}{141608}Follow me.
{141955}{142002}Just testing. Sorry.
{142063}{142105}Follow me. Now.
{142303}{142335}Come.
{142423}{142483}The fishmonger promised me|hed have some fresh salmon.
{142483}{142535}Hes normally so reliable.
{142543}{142608}- Can we take our glasses?|- Good idea.
{142699}{142759}Hey! I didn't even eat the mousse.
{142891}{142951}Honestly, darling, I'm so embarrassed.
{142951}{142987}It really is embarrassing.
{142987}{143079}To serve salmon with botulism|at a dinner party is social death.
{143131}{143193}- Shall we take our cars?|- Why not?
{143215}{143252}Good idea.
{144127}{144170}Behold paradise.
{144259}{144330}- I love it here, darling.|- Me, too, Marvin.
{144367}{144419}Hello. Welcome to Heaven.
{144643}{144720}Excuse me.|Could you just sign here, please, sir?
{144739}{144834}Thank you. Theres a table for you|through there, in the restaurant.
{144835}{144908}- For the ladies.|- Afterlife mints. Thank you.

{145003}{145083}Of course, madam.|It's Christmas every day in Heaven.
{145111}{145164}- How about that?|- Lovely.
{146239}{146287}Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
{146287}{146380}It's truly a real honorable experience|to be here this evening...
{146395}{146453}a very wonderful and warm...
{146455}{146520}and emotional moment for all of us.
{146539}{146608}And I'd like to sing a song for all ofyou.
{146755}{146808}"It's Christmas in Heaven

{148987}{149072}That's the end of the film.|Now heres the meaning of life.
{149095}{149142}Thank you, Brigitte.
{149251}{149335}It's nothing special.|"Try to be nice to people. Avoid eating fat.
{149335}{149395}"Read a good book now and then.|Get some walking in.

{149491}{149587}Finally, here are some gratuitous pictures|of penises to annoy the censors...
{149587}{149671}and hopefully spark controversy,|which is the only way...
{149671}{149777}to get the jaded video-sated public|off their asses and back in the cinema.
{149791}{149863}Family entertainment? Bollocks.|They want filth:
