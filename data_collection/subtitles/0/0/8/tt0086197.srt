1
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,227
<i>There was a demon that lived in the air.</i>

2
00:01:01,477 --> 00:01:06,732
<i>They said whoever challenged him
would die.</i>

3
00:01:06,982 --> 00:01:08,859
<i>Their controls would freeze up.</i>

4
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:12,404
<i>Their planes would buffet wildly...</i>

5
00:01:12,654 --> 00:01:16,199
<i>... and they would disintegrate.</i>

6
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,330
<i>The demon lived at Mach 1 on the meter...</i>

7
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,082
<i>... 750 miles an hour...</i>

8
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:29,378
<i>... where the air could no longer
move out of the way.</i>

9
00:01:29,628 --> 00:01:36,468
<i>He lived behind a barrier through
which they said no man could ever pass.</i>

10
00:01:36,677 --> 00:01:41,723
<i>They called it the sound barrier.</i>

11
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:44,601
<i>Then they built a small plane...</i>

12
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:49,230
<i>... the X-1, to try and break
the sound barrier.</i>

13
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,403
<i>And men came to the high desert
of California to ride it.</i>

14
00:01:57,697 --> 00:02:01,742
<i>They were called test pilots...</i>

15
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:05,829
<i>... and no one knew their names.</i>

16
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:22,929
<i>Okay, Whiskey Kilo 28, prepare to drop.</i>

17
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:25,848
<i>Roger, Ground Control.
This is Whiskey Kilo 28...</i>

18
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:30,102
<i>... lowering and launching... now.</i>

19
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:44,449
<i>Mach .92.</i>

20
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:49,954
<i>.93.</i>

21
00:02:51,747 --> 00:02:53,916
<i>.94.</i>

22
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:57,795
<i>Hit a mild buffet there.</i>

23
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,632
<i>Mach.95.</i>

24
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:17,647
<i>.98!</i>

25
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,318
<i>.99!</i>

26
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:25,487
<i>WK 28, do you want
to declare an emergency?</i>

27
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:29,783
<i>Negative. WK 28 is not...</i>

28
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:57,976
Go away.

29
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:10,655
"Lord, guard and guide

30
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:14,325
The men who fly

31
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:18,287
Through the great spaces

32
00:04:18,537 --> 00:04:22,541
In the sky."

33
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:26,378
"Be with them always

34
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:29,423
In the air

35
00:04:29,673 --> 00:04:36,262
In darkening storms or sunlight fair."

36
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:45,771
"Hear us when we lift our prayer

37
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:52,111
For all in peril

38
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:57,449
In the air."

39
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:50,070
I was looking at the pictures on your wall.

40
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,780
How come a fancy pilot...

41
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,742
...like Slick there,
doesn't have his picture up there?

42
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:58,661
What do you have to do
to get your picture up there?

43
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,331
You have to die.

44
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,503
Well, Yeager, you old bastard.

45
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:12,633
Don't just stand in the doorway
like some lonesome sheepherder.

46
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:14,843
Get your ass over here and have a drink.

47
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:18,263
I got you something.

48
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:28,981
You could be the first.

49
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:32,485
The man who breaks the sound barrier
will be on top.

50
00:08:32,735 --> 00:08:34,195
You'd be the one they remembered.

51
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:38,490
You're the best civilian pilot around.

52
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:41,827
You get that helmet?

53
00:08:43,412 --> 00:08:44,746
It might work.

54
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:46,706
I'll look like the Galloping Ghost in it.

55
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:50,585
Some people say the sound barrier
can't be broke.

56
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:53,296
An engineer will tell you it's an absolute...

57
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:56,049
...like the firmness of the earth.

58
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:59,510
The sound barrier is a farm
you can buy in the sky.

59
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,763
The controls will freeze up.
You can't budge the stick.

60
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:07,309
Anybody tries to break it will auger in.

61
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:11,355
Well now, maybe it can't be broke.

62
00:09:11,605 --> 00:09:14,024
Then again...

63
00:09:14,274 --> 00:09:17,319
...maybe it can.

64
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:23,324
Maybe it can only be broke
for a specified sum.

65
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:26,327
How much?

66
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:29,747
$150,000.

67
00:09:29,997 --> 00:09:34,126
Come on, Slick, give us a break.

68
00:09:34,293 --> 00:09:38,505
Non-negotiable, as usual.

69
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:44,052
What do we do now?

70
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:46,554
That guy in the corner...

71
00:09:46,805 --> 00:09:48,098
Yeager is his name.

72
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:51,559
He's some kind of a war hero.
Shot down five Germans in one day.

73
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:54,395
He's a natural-born stick-and-rudder man.

74
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:58,065
As press-liaison man for the Air Force,
I think...

75
00:09:58,315 --> 00:10:00,234
Any problems with him?

76
00:10:00,484 --> 00:10:02,403
- Only one.
- What's that?

77
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:05,697
Holding him back.

78
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:17,750
We were just talking to Slick
about the sound barrier.

79
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:20,628
We feel that the X-1
is ready to have a go at it.

80
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:24,715
We think the X-1's got the answer
to go beyond Mach 1.

81
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:28,219
If there is any beyond.

82
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,972
So, what do you think?

83
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:35,892
I'll tell you. Half these engineers
have never been off the ground.

84
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:39,479
They might tell you that
the sound barrier's a brick wall.

85
00:10:39,729 --> 00:10:42,732
It'll rip your ears off
if you try to go through it.

86
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:46,236
If you ask me,
I don't believe the damn thing even exists.

87
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:48,488
Waitress, a drink for Mr. Yeager.

88
00:10:48,738 --> 00:10:50,948
No thanks, I got one.

89
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:53,909
So, do you think
you want to have a go at it?

90
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,578
I might.

91
00:10:55,828 --> 00:11:01,125
But since, as you say,
this sound barrier doesn't really exist...

92
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,584
...how much...

93
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:04,920
How much you got?

94
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:10,008
Just joking.
The Air Force is already paying me. Right?

95
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:12,927
So when do we go?

96
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:15,722
How about tomorrow morning?

97
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:17,932
I'll be there.

98
00:11:18,182 --> 00:11:21,269
See you there.

99
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:24,939
How much are you paying him?

100
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:27,775
I think it's $283.

101
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:29,026
A week?

102
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:30,944
A month.

103
00:11:31,195 --> 00:11:34,322
Well, that's not bad.

104
00:11:38,118 --> 00:11:40,745
First fellow to break the sound barrier...

105
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:45,416
...gets a free steak with all the trimmings.

106
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:50,588
I'll have mine medium rare, please.

107
00:11:56,969 --> 00:12:01,431
Honey, you ever been caught
on the desert alone?

108
00:12:04,476 --> 00:12:07,520
I never have.

109
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:11,941
I don't think I ever will.

110
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:15,987
Never met the man
who could catch me out there.

111
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:19,281
I'm half jackrabbit.

112
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:23,410
Forget it, flyboy.

113
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:26,663
You'd never catch me.

114
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,666
I believe I will.

115
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,128
Can't be done.

116
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,481
Could I ask you something?

117
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,693
Forget it, sweetie.

118
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,987
She's his wife.

119
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,258
Glennis! I'm gonna get you!

120
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:27,095
Come back here!

121
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:54,845
What have you two been up to?

122
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,680
Where's Ridley?

123
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,308
Over there waiting on you.

124
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:06,480
Can I talk to you?

125
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,986
I got a little problem.

126
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,073
A horse threw me last night
and I dinged up my goddamn ribs.

127
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:17,199
How bad?

128
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,869
I feel like I broke a couple
of the sons of bitches.

129
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:24,706
I won't be able to lean over
to shut the door. Got any ideas?

130
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:28,001
Your left side okay?

131
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:32,380
I don't want these guys to know.
They'll find somebody else to fly this thing.

132
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,092
I'll try to fix you a handle.

133
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:45,225
Can you help me out?
I got a small emergency.

134
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:51,273
I need to borrow your broom handle.
Just hold this right here.

135
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:01,949
I think that'll work.

136
00:16:15,504 --> 00:16:18,423
Punch a hole in the sky.

137
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:21,718
I'll be right back.

138
00:16:25,763 --> 00:16:26,931
How are you feeling?

139
00:16:27,181 --> 00:16:30,309
Oh, just about right.

140
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:35,162
There she is, partner.
All bridled, saddled and ready to go.

141
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:37,081
You got any Beemans?

142
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:38,832
Yeah, I got a stick.

143
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:40,959
Loan me some. I'll pay you back later.

144
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:43,962
Fair enough.

145
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:01,562
Stick this in the handle.
Take your good arm and just whang it.

146
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:04,857
Okay, thanks, buddy.

147
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:25,891
<i>Pre-drop checklist complete.</i>

148
00:19:26,141 --> 00:19:29,520
<i>Ten... nine...</i>

149
00:19:38,403 --> 00:19:40,989
<i>Drop!</i>

150
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:46,285
<i>There you go, buddy.</i>

151
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:53,042
<i>Put your spurs to her, Chuck.</i>

152
00:20:17,732 --> 00:20:21,068
<i>Mach.91.</i>

153
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,836
<i>.92.</i>

154
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:46,259
<i>.93.</i>

155
00:20:50,387 --> 00:20:52,056
<i>Hit a mild buffet there.</i>

156
00:20:52,306 --> 00:20:55,684
<i>Just the usual instability.</i>

157
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:58,228
<i>Ridley, make a note here,
would you, if you got...</i>

158
00:20:58,478 --> 00:21:03,275
<i>... nothing better to do.
Elevator effectiveness regained.</i>

159
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:12,950
<i>.95.</i>

160
00:21:15,077 --> 00:21:18,247
<i>.96.</i>

161
00:21:22,668 --> 00:21:24,795
<i>More buffeting.</i>

162
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:26,255
<i>More commotion.</i>

163
00:21:26,505 --> 00:21:29,633
<i>Getting wobbly here.</i>

164
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:34,137
<i>.98.</i>

165
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:37,682
<i>She's getting real active.</i>

166
00:21:45,398 --> 00:21:48,108
<i>.99!</i>

167
00:21:57,576 --> 00:22:00,620
What's that sound?

168
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:09,045
He bought the farm.

169
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:14,049
That's it. We're back to square one.

170
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,845
Wait a minute.

171
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:27,270
<i>Ridley, make another note, would you?</i>

172
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:29,856
<i>Must be something wrong
with the Machmeter.</i>

173
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:32,358
<i>Jumped plumb off the scale.</i>

174
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:34,360
<i>Gone screwy on me.</i>

175
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:36,738
<i>You bust it, we'll fix it.</i>

176
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:41,033
<i>Personally, I think you're seeing things.</i>

177
00:22:42,118 --> 00:22:47,331
<i>Could be. I'm still going upstairs
like a bat out of hell.</i>

178
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:52,377
We did it!

179
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:55,380
We finally broke the sound barrier.

180
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,508
We did it!

181
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:37,545
I want to place a long-distance call
to Los Angeles.

182
00:23:37,795 --> 00:23:39,046
Who are you calling?

183
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:40,214
The press!

184
00:23:40,464 --> 00:23:43,801
This is big news.
The sound barrier's been broken.

185
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:45,886
No, sir. No press.

186
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:48,722
No word of this goes beyond the flight line.

187
00:23:48,972 --> 00:23:52,642
What's going on? This is big news.
We need coverage of this.

188
00:23:52,893 --> 00:23:54,644
No, sir. Sorry, no press.

189
00:23:54,894 --> 00:23:57,230
Those are orders. National security.

190
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,065
But the war's over!

191
00:23:59,315 --> 00:24:02,568
Look, pal, maybe they don't want
someone to know.

192
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:03,986
Who?

193
00:24:04,237 --> 00:24:05,655
The Russians, maybe.

194
00:24:05,905 --> 00:24:08,157
But they're our allies!

195
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:14,329
Well, anyway, someone figured it out
that way, and that's the way it is.

196
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,832
Chuck, you're our man!

197
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:18,625
You're the fastest man alive!

198
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,627
We want you to fly more planes for us.

199
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,838
We want you to fly all our planes!

200
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:28,134
What you been doing, hedgehopping?

201
00:25:06,962 --> 00:25:08,505
Word will get out, Major.

202
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:11,550
Maybe not to the press
or the general public.

203
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,887
But soon, every fighter jock, rocket ace,
and rat-racer in the country...

204
00:25:16,138 --> 00:25:21,059
...will be headed this way, wanting
to push the outside of the envelope...

205
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:25,855
...and get to the top of the pyramid.

206
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,755
Edwards Air Force Base.

207
00:25:53,006 --> 00:25:54,841
This is the place to be, hon.

208
00:25:55,091 --> 00:26:00,096
They're going faster, farther
and higher here than anywhere else.

209
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:06,268
I'll tell you something else, too.

210
00:26:06,518 --> 00:26:11,773
We'll climb right up that ladder,
just like we did at Langley.

211
00:26:12,023 --> 00:26:13,942
We?

212
00:26:14,192 --> 00:26:16,111
You mean you.

213
00:26:16,361 --> 00:26:18,279
Hon, we're a team!

214
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,907
I move up, you move up.

215
00:26:21,157 --> 00:26:24,952
Right to the top of the old pyramid.

216
00:26:25,203 --> 00:26:26,287
Slow down, Gordo.

217
00:26:26,537 --> 00:26:28,789
Come on now, you're scaring the girls.

218
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,752
You're scaring the girls. You are!

219
00:26:37,547 --> 00:26:41,593
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?

220
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:45,764
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?

221
00:26:50,727 --> 00:26:54,272
You're looking at him, baby.

222
00:26:56,899 --> 00:26:59,151
Come on, cheer up.

223
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:03,572
Hey, have I ever let you down?

224
00:29:59,613 --> 00:30:02,741
Deke, that's 62 men...

225
00:30:02,991 --> 00:30:06,494
...in the last 36 weeks.

226
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:10,081
You know what that averages?

227
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:15,711
Is that Gus Grissom from Langley Field?

228
00:30:15,961 --> 00:30:18,797
What is an ace like you
doing in a place like this?

229
00:30:19,048 --> 00:30:21,884
Well, if it ain't Hot Dog.

230
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:24,094
Gordo...

231
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:26,555
...Cooper, right?
- Yeah.

232
00:30:26,805 --> 00:30:30,892
Gordo thinks he's one of those
hot-dog pilots you hear so much about.

233
00:30:31,142 --> 00:30:32,894
You got a short memory.

234
00:30:33,144 --> 00:30:37,815
I am not one of them hot-dog pilots.
I am the Hot Dog Man himself.

235
00:30:38,065 --> 00:30:43,654
I guess you're too shy to tell this guy
how I used to wax your tail.

236
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,658
Wax my tail?

237
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,869
Hot Dog, you were just in my shadow.

238
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,121
That's where you'll always be.

239
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:56,708
What are you two rookies going to have?

240
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:59,502
Rookies?

241
00:31:00,295 --> 00:31:02,880
Now hold on, sis.

242
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:07,593
You are looking
at a whole new ballgame here now.

243
00:31:07,843 --> 00:31:10,596
In a few years I bet you're even
going to immortalize us...

244
00:31:10,846 --> 00:31:15,267
...by putting our pictures up there
on your wall.

245
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:22,024
Did I say something wrong?

246
00:31:22,274 --> 00:31:26,069
I'll tell you. We got two categories
of pilots around here.

247
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,531
We got your prime pilots
that get all the hot planes.

248
00:31:29,781 --> 00:31:34,660
And we got your pudknockers
who dream about getting the hot planes.

249
00:31:34,911 --> 00:31:39,665
Now what are you two pudknockers
going to have?

250
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:46,213
Scotch.

251
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:49,341
You know what happened!
The machine broke.

252
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:50,675
Not the machine, it's the man.

253
00:31:50,926 --> 00:31:55,889
He was dead before he went up.
Don't talk about it here.

254
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:19,077
Good one. Now fire it in here.

255
00:32:19,077 --> 00:32:21,121
Look at old Yeager.

256
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:25,125
On top of the pyramid
for five goddamn years.

257
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:29,462
Every time somebody goes faster,
he just goes up again.

258
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:33,591
He stays the fastest man alive.

259
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:39,221
You know...

260
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:41,390
...sometimes...

261
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,436
...all it takes is just the sound
of a truck starting.

262
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,146
I think:

263
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:51,650
"That's the crash truck."

264
00:32:56,904 --> 00:32:58,489
Anyway...

265
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,325
...I'm really glad we could talk.

266
00:33:01,576 --> 00:33:06,247
I thought I was the only one
who had these nightmares.

267
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:08,123
Yeah, me too.

268
00:33:08,374 --> 00:33:11,835
Nobody ever wants to talk
about anything around here.

269
00:33:12,085 --> 00:33:15,172
Everybody's always trying to...

270
00:33:15,422 --> 00:33:19,801
..."maintain an even strain".

271
00:33:19,926 --> 00:33:25,932
Well, you marry a fighter jock
and you marry the military.

272
00:33:25,932 --> 00:33:27,850
I'll tell you one thing.

273
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,978
The military owes me for all this.

274
00:33:31,228 --> 00:33:35,316
One day I expect the military
to make good.

275
00:33:38,777 --> 00:33:43,198
Well, it sure ain't your average dull life.

276
00:33:43,448 --> 00:33:45,158
I went East for a reunion...

277
00:33:45,408 --> 00:33:48,620
...and all my friends could talk about
was their husbands' work.

278
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:54,000
How dog-eat-dog and cutthroat it was
on Madison Avenue...

279
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:57,336
...places like that.

280
00:33:58,963 --> 00:34:02,174
Cutthroat?

281
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:05,886
I wondered how they would have felt...

282
00:34:06,136 --> 00:34:09,389
...if each time their husband
went in to make a deal...

283
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:15,145
...there was a one in four chance
he wouldn't come out of the meeting.

284
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:22,985
I'm going home to my folks in San Diego.

285
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:27,114
What did Gordo say?

286
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:31,410
He "maintained an even strain".

287
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,458
Look at them.

288
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:42,671
You'd think they were talking about sports.

289
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:50,345
Men...

290
00:34:50,595 --> 00:34:55,266
Sometimes they're just such... assholes.

291
00:35:06,902 --> 00:35:10,155
Sometimes they sure are
handy assholes, though.

292
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:13,408
Yeah, sometimes...

293
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:17,120
Sometimes.

294
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:23,417
You want a hot dog?

295
00:35:28,255 --> 00:35:31,800
I'm leaving, Gordo.

296
00:35:36,763 --> 00:35:38,348
Look at that!

297
00:35:38,598 --> 00:35:41,351
Yeah, that's the D-558 Phase 2.

298
00:35:41,601 --> 00:35:43,019
Scott Crossfield.

299
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:47,482
It sure as hell is. Jesus!

300
00:35:49,275 --> 00:35:52,903
He scorched that one, didn't he?

301
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:57,032
He's pushing the outside of the envelope.

302
00:35:57,283 --> 00:35:59,118
He must be going for a record.

303
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:03,080
He's shooting for Mach 2, I heard.

304
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:08,835
<i>On the 50th anniversary
of the Wright Brothers' historic flight...</i>

305
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:12,630
<i>... another historic flight takes place,
as Scott Crossfield...</i>

306
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:16,884
<i>... streaks across the skies
over the high desert in California.</i>

307
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:18,135
<i>Mach 2.</i>

308
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:21,222
<i>Almost 1,500 miles per hour...</i>

309
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:23,891
<i>... and a new world record!</i>

310
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:26,393
<i>It's a field day for the press.</i>

311
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,979
<i>Congratulations come
from a previous record holder...</i>

312
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:34,025
<i>... as he shakes the hand
of the fastest man alive, Scott Crossfield.</i>

313
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:37,237
<i>And there's a comradeship of speed.</i>

314
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:42,116
To Scott Crossfield, the fastest man alive.

315
00:37:00,008 --> 00:37:03,720
Compliments of Pancho's, Scotty.

316
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,265
The real test wasn't Mach 2.

317
00:37:07,515 --> 00:37:12,645
I guess that demon lives out
at about 2.3 on your Machmeter.

318
00:37:12,895 --> 00:37:15,606
Yeah, but Mach 2 was the magic number.

319
00:37:15,856 --> 00:37:20,736
Like 60 homers, like batting.400,
like the four-minute mile.

320
00:37:20,986 --> 00:37:23,113
The press likes a nice round number.

321
00:37:23,364 --> 00:37:26,450
After that, they don't care,
until the next magic number.

322
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,370
You need more than speed records.
You need coverage.

323
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,955
Coverage?

324
00:37:32,205 --> 00:37:35,792
You mean them root weevils
that crawl around popping off cameras?

325
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:38,211
Those root weevils write history.

326
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:43,883
Let them write the history,
and let the pilots fly the planes.

327
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,761
Pilots.

328
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:12,243
You know what really makes
your rocket ships go up?

329
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:15,996
The aerodynamics would take
so long to explain to you that...

330
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:17,122
Funding.

331
00:38:17,373 --> 00:38:19,291
That's what makes your ships go up.

332
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:21,543
I'll tell you something.

333
00:38:21,794 --> 00:38:23,712
And you guys, too.

334
00:38:23,962 --> 00:38:27,007
No bucks, no Buck Rogers.

335
00:38:27,257 --> 00:38:29,718
Whoever gets the funding
gets the technology.

336
00:38:29,968 --> 00:38:32,762
Whoever gets the technology stays on top.

337
00:38:33,012 --> 00:38:35,265
Flyboy, let's dance.

338
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:38,643
I'll drink to that.

339
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,591
He'll be going after Crossfield soon,
won't he?

340
00:39:12,842 --> 00:39:14,009
No, he won't.

341
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:19,139
He'll be going after that demon
that lives in the thin air.

342
00:39:58,134 --> 00:39:59,719
You got any Beemans?

343
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:03,556
Even before you hit Mach 2,
she'll be unforgiving on you.

344
00:40:03,806 --> 00:40:06,475
So take it easy.
Wring her out a little bit this time.

345
00:40:06,726 --> 00:40:07,643
You got any gum?

346
00:40:07,893 --> 00:40:08,936
Yeah, I got me a stick.

347
00:40:09,186 --> 00:40:11,814
Loan me some. I'll pay you back later.

348
00:40:12,064 --> 00:40:15,275
- Fair enough.
- Thank you.

349
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:30,915
<i>Okay, drop her.</i>

350
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:34,877
All right, here we go again.

351
00:40:37,588 --> 00:40:40,049
Drop!

352
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:52,352
<i>Number 3 coming on.</i>

353
00:40:59,025 --> 00:41:03,237
<i>Got seven seconds on 150 right now.</i>

354
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:23,756
<i>I've got you in sight, Chuck.</i>

355
00:41:24,007 --> 00:41:25,967
<i>Going out of sight...</i>

356
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,761
<i>... now!</i>

357
00:41:34,016 --> 00:41:36,894
<i>Mach 1.</i>

358
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:48,488
<i>Number 4.</i>

359
00:41:52,116 --> 00:41:53,785
<i>Here goes Mach 2.</i>

360
00:41:54,035 --> 00:41:55,203
<i>2. 1.</i>

361
00:41:55,453 --> 00:41:58,331
<i>Sorry, Scotty.</i>

362
00:41:58,456 --> 00:41:59,707
<i>You got her now, buddy.</i>

363
00:41:59,957 --> 00:42:02,293
<i>You can ease it back.</i>

364
00:42:02,543 --> 00:42:03,794
<i>Bring it on in.</i>

365
00:42:04,044 --> 00:42:06,880
<i>I'm pushing the envelope.</i>

366
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:10,467
<i>See where that demon lives.</i>

367
00:42:29,318 --> 00:42:32,863
<i>Come in, Chuck.</i>

368
00:42:33,364 --> 00:42:34,656
<i>Say again. Over.</i>

369
00:42:34,907 --> 00:42:38,327
<i>Do you read? Over.</i>

370
00:42:39,244 --> 00:42:42,455
<i>Damn! He's uncorked it!</i>

371
00:42:42,706 --> 00:42:43,999
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

372
00:42:44,249 --> 00:42:47,627
<i>Alert all ground crews.</i>

373
00:42:50,755 --> 00:42:53,966
<i>Talk to me!</i>

374
00:42:59,263 --> 00:43:01,807
<i>Come in!</i>

375
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:06,562
<i>Do you read me? Over.</i>

376
00:43:16,654 --> 00:43:19,991
<i>I'm fighting bad here.</i>

377
00:43:20,283 --> 00:43:24,996
<i>I'm down to 25,000 over Tehachapi.</i>

378
00:43:27,123 --> 00:43:31,043
<i>I don't know if I can make it
back to base or not.</i>

379
00:43:31,293 --> 00:43:32,503
<i>What happened?</i>

380
00:43:32,753 --> 00:43:35,547
<i>Think I bust the canopy with my head.</i>

381
00:43:35,797 --> 00:43:38,925
<i>I'm getting okay now.</i>

382
00:43:40,135 --> 00:43:43,888
<i>We sure chased that old demon this time.</i>

383
00:43:44,139 --> 00:43:47,725
<i>That's as fast as a man can go.</i>

384
00:43:48,142 --> 00:43:51,354
<i>What's next, Ridley?</i>

385
00:44:29,723 --> 00:44:30,807
It's called Sputnik.

386
00:44:31,058 --> 00:44:34,561
We know. Sit down.

387
00:44:38,857 --> 00:44:41,359
And as I was saying...

388
00:44:41,609 --> 00:44:45,530
...whoever controls
the high ground of space...

389
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,074
...will control the world.

390
00:44:48,324 --> 00:44:52,578
The Roman Empire controlled
the world because it could build roads.

391
00:44:52,828 --> 00:44:57,791
Later, the British Empire was dominant
because it had ships.

392
00:44:58,041 --> 00:45:03,171
In the air stage, we were powerful
because we had the airplane.

393
00:45:03,421 --> 00:45:07,217
Now the Communists have established
a foothold in outer space.

394
00:45:07,467 --> 00:45:10,845
Soon they'll have space platforms
to drop nuclear bombs on us...

395
00:45:11,095 --> 00:45:13,681
...like rocks from a highway overpass.

396
00:45:13,931 --> 00:45:16,809
How the hell did they get ahead of us?

397
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:20,646
Gentlemen, I think we're ready.

398
00:45:24,691 --> 00:45:28,820
Is there a loose plug over there anywhere?

399
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,698
Here it is. I'll get it.

400
00:45:31,948 --> 00:45:34,701
Senator Johnson's right.
This is Armageddon.

401
00:45:34,951 --> 00:45:37,704
The decisive battle between
the forces of good and evil.

402
00:45:37,954 --> 00:45:42,333
We're engaged in a struggle for survival.

403
00:45:43,209 --> 00:45:45,503
This footage was assembled from...

404
00:45:45,753 --> 00:45:49,673
...sources operating under deep cover
at great risk.

405
00:45:49,924 --> 00:45:53,177
We're fortunate this material
did not perish with a couple of men.

406
00:45:53,427 --> 00:45:56,513
This is secret footage
of the Russian Korabl rocket...

407
00:45:56,763 --> 00:46:00,475
...and these are the German scientists
that they captured after the war.

408
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:05,438
Was it their German scientists
who got them up there first?

409
00:46:05,772 --> 00:46:07,315
No, it was not, Senator.

410
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:10,651
Our Germans are better
than their Germans.

411
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:13,904
That's Titov on the right
and on the left is Gagarin.

412
00:46:14,155 --> 00:46:18,534
No, Titov's on the left.
Gagarin's on the right.

413
00:46:18,784 --> 00:46:21,120
They bear a great resemblance
to each other.

414
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:25,916
If the Soviets ever do put a man up there,
it will be one of these two.

415
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:28,001
Most likely, the one on the left.

416
00:46:28,251 --> 00:46:31,129
- Gagarin.
- Titov.

417
00:46:31,171 --> 00:46:32,589
Isn't that their chief designer?

418
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:34,257
We know very little about him.

419
00:46:34,507 --> 00:46:36,926
- Let us see him again.
- Here's some more of him.

420
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:40,096
They've developed a program
of stupendous dimensions...

421
00:46:40,346 --> 00:46:44,475
...and he is clearly the genius behind it.

422
00:46:44,934 --> 00:46:47,603
I, for one, do not intend to go to sleep...

423
00:46:47,853 --> 00:46:51,732
...by the light of a Communist moon.

424
00:46:53,942 --> 00:46:57,654
Get that moron off of there!

425
00:47:00,198 --> 00:47:02,867
We could have orbited
a satellite a year ago...

426
00:47:03,117 --> 00:47:05,078
...if we had been given a green light.

427
00:47:05,328 --> 00:47:08,956
Now we must get something up there
quick and dirty, any way at all.

428
00:47:09,207 --> 00:47:10,458
Well, what?

429
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:14,670
By combining our available rockets,
the Redstone, the Atlas...

430
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,048
...I agree that we could launch a pod.

431
00:47:18,298 --> 00:47:19,299
A pot?

432
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:20,801
A pod.

433
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:22,219
A capsule.

434
00:47:22,469 --> 00:47:25,055
Now, we will be in full control of this pod.

435
00:47:25,305 --> 00:47:27,432
It will go up like a cannonball...

436
00:47:27,682 --> 00:47:30,310
...and come down like a cannonball...

437
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,021
...splashing down in the ocean...

438
00:47:33,271 --> 00:47:37,483
...with a parachute to spare the life
of the specimen inside.

439
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:39,151
Spaceman?

440
00:47:39,402 --> 00:47:42,154
Specimen.

441
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:46,617
Well, what kind of "specimen"?

442
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:48,660
A tough one.

443
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:51,788
Responsive to orders.

444
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:54,082
I had in mind a jimp.

445
00:47:54,332 --> 00:47:55,333
"Jimp"?

446
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,669
Well, what the hell is a "jimp"?

447
00:47:57,919 --> 00:48:01,756
A jimp. A jimpanzee, Senator. An ape.

448
00:48:02,006 --> 00:48:07,386
The first American into space
is not going to be a chimpanzee.

449
00:48:07,386 --> 00:48:10,139
Who would you put into space,
Mr. President?

450
00:48:10,389 --> 00:48:14,184
We have film of some people
we think are strong candidates.

451
00:48:14,435 --> 00:48:18,855
We'd like to run it by you
and stimulate some thinking.

452
00:48:19,106 --> 00:48:22,901
These are people we felt
would be excellent in the splashdown.

453
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:24,861
We like the one on the right.

454
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:28,364
- No, on the left.
- On the right. Don't embarrass me!

455
00:48:28,615 --> 00:48:33,202
These people are very experienced with
machinery and have their own helmets.

456
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,579
Is that a factor?

457
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,455
As you'll see...

458
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:40,501
...they're quite comfortable
in conditions of flame.

459
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:46,632
Now this is personnel who have
very well-developed equilibrium.

460
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,176
Good middle ear. Also very nice people.

461
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,552
Very easy to work with.

462
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,680
With some work,
they could be very responsive to orders.

463
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,683
This is my first choice.
The man with the hood.

464
00:48:56,933 --> 00:49:01,521
Since he works without eyesight,
his other senses are sharpened.

465
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:04,982
In space there'll be little need
for eyeballing at any rate.

466
00:49:05,232 --> 00:49:07,985
The cannonball effect you mentioned...

467
00:49:08,235 --> 00:49:10,863
We were basically thinking about...

468
00:49:11,113 --> 00:49:13,156
...putting a couple into orbit.

469
00:49:13,407 --> 00:49:16,034
Possibly adds emotional stability.

470
00:49:16,284 --> 00:49:19,537
This individual combines many
plus factors that we mentioned.

471
00:49:19,788 --> 00:49:23,708
Ease with flames, comfort at heights
and agility in the splashdown phase.

472
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:27,879
Also, he is available as of the 15th.

473
00:49:28,713 --> 00:49:31,007
I want test pilots!

474
00:49:31,257 --> 00:49:33,300
Test pilots? No, you can't deal with them.

475
00:49:33,551 --> 00:49:36,679
I'm sure we can do better
with another type of man...

476
00:49:36,929 --> 00:49:38,681
...any other type of man.

477
00:49:38,931 --> 00:49:40,516
A more manageable type.

478
00:49:40,766 --> 00:49:42,601
It will only complicate things.

479
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:45,228
With a man we must guarantee
a safe return.

480
00:49:45,479 --> 00:49:50,025
Mr. President, I think
you'd be wise to reconsider.

481
00:49:50,316 --> 00:49:51,401
Test pilots?

482
00:49:51,651 --> 00:49:53,236
We'll be heading for some air bases.

483
00:49:53,486 --> 00:49:55,113
Not just some air bases.

484
00:49:55,363 --> 00:49:59,867
The one with the great test pilots.
There's only one place to go.

485
00:50:00,117 --> 00:50:03,996
<i>I was there once before
and I hoped I'd never have to go back.</i>

486
00:50:04,246 --> 00:50:08,917
<i>It's a god-forsaken spot on the roof
of the high desert in California.</i>

487
00:50:09,168 --> 00:50:12,754
A prehistoric throwback
of an airfield called Edwards.

488
00:50:13,004 --> 00:50:15,840
They've got a weird, mad-monk squadron.

489
00:50:16,091 --> 00:50:18,593
They live in rat shacks, terrible conditions.

490
00:50:18,843 --> 00:50:22,680
Corrugated tin, bare bones, low rent.

491
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:24,766
This is the joint they hang out in.

492
00:50:25,016 --> 00:50:27,268
Pancho's Happy Bottom Riding Club.

493
00:50:27,518 --> 00:50:29,937
It's called Happy Bottom Riding Club?

494
00:50:30,187 --> 00:50:32,398
How'd it get a name like that?

495
00:50:32,648 --> 00:50:35,567
Ask Pancho.

496
00:50:37,194 --> 00:50:40,489
We're meeting the Liaison Officer.
They are expecting us.

497
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:42,324
They? Who's "they"?

498
00:50:42,574 --> 00:50:45,327
The best...

499
00:50:46,536 --> 00:50:49,539
The best test pilots in the world.

500
00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:52,875
They got some kind of brotherhood.

501
00:50:53,126 --> 00:50:55,127
They think they got the right stuff.

502
00:50:55,378 --> 00:50:57,630
What stuff? Heroism, bravery?

503
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,632
There any snakes around here?

504
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:01,508
Yeah. In the bushes.

505
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:05,971
Heroism and bravery are part of it.
But seems to be more to it.

506
00:51:06,221 --> 00:51:07,639
What do they say it means?

507
00:51:07,889 --> 00:51:10,725
They don't say anything.
They don't talk about it.

508
00:51:10,976 --> 00:51:13,186
They don't talk about it to outsiders?

509
00:51:13,436 --> 00:51:14,646
To each other.

510
00:51:14,896 --> 00:51:17,982
To outsiders they say even less.

511
00:51:18,233 --> 00:51:20,193
Anyway, they're all here.

512
00:51:20,443 --> 00:51:22,487
Including the ace of aces himself.

513
00:51:22,737 --> 00:51:24,655
Who's that?

514
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:26,198
Yeager.

515
00:51:26,449 --> 00:51:29,451
Never heard of him.

516
00:51:42,005 --> 00:51:44,841
These must be our gentlemen
from Washington...

517
00:51:45,091 --> 00:51:48,469
...scouting for astronauts.

518
00:51:49,846 --> 00:51:52,848
Scouting for lab rabbits, more likely.

519
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:56,310
I didn't quite hear you.

520
00:51:57,228 --> 00:51:59,938
I said, "Lab rabbits".

521
00:52:00,189 --> 00:52:01,190
What's that mean?

522
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,526
It means you don't need
honest-to-God pilots.

523
00:52:04,776 --> 00:52:08,989
What you ought to get is a lab rabbit
to curl up in your damn capsule...

524
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:11,157
...with its heart beating...

525
00:52:11,408 --> 00:52:14,661
...and a wire up the kazoo.

526
00:52:15,662 --> 00:52:16,746
I don't hold with it.

527
00:52:16,996 --> 00:52:18,498
I don't either.

528
00:52:18,748 --> 00:52:21,334
You want a pilot to be a ballistic missile.

529
00:52:21,584 --> 00:52:23,377
And then splashdown.

530
00:52:23,627 --> 00:52:25,504
Possibly get lost at sea.

531
00:52:25,754 --> 00:52:28,507
There's some things you can't change.

532
00:52:28,757 --> 00:52:31,009
Some peckerwood's
got to take the beast up.

533
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,846
And some peckerwood's got to land it.

534
00:52:35,097 --> 00:52:39,017
And that peckerwood is called a pilot.

535
00:52:39,267 --> 00:52:40,769
You're mighty right.

536
00:52:41,019 --> 00:52:43,521
The boys smell panic in your program.

537
00:52:43,771 --> 00:52:45,898
That's one thing they don't respond to.

538
00:52:46,149 --> 00:52:50,361
Now maybe if we talk privately
to Yeager and some of the other boys...

539
00:52:50,611 --> 00:52:51,695
That's Yeager?

540
00:52:51,946 --> 00:52:56,825
Anybody goes up in the damn thing's
gonna be Spam in a can.

541
00:53:01,038 --> 00:53:03,832
Yeager doesn't fit the profile.

542
00:53:04,082 --> 00:53:08,044
He didn't go to college.
We're only taking college personnel.

543
00:53:08,294 --> 00:53:14,509
Forget about Walker and Crossfield
and the other civilian pilots, too.

544
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:18,888
The security clearance just takes
too long with those people.

545
00:53:19,138 --> 00:53:23,517
Besides, they seem
a little too independent.

546
00:53:23,642 --> 00:53:26,353
You mean for this space race...

547
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,897
...you don't want our best pilots?

548
00:53:29,147 --> 00:53:30,899
I didn't say that.

549
00:53:31,149 --> 00:53:36,029
We want the best pilots that we can get.

550
00:53:37,363 --> 00:53:39,282
Y'all want some whiskey?

551
00:53:39,532 --> 00:53:42,160
No, thanks, Fred. Just a little coffee.

552
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:44,787
I'd like a Coca-Cola.

553
00:53:45,037 --> 00:53:46,664
In a clean glass.

554
00:53:46,914 --> 00:53:51,835
There's an old saying:
"Never refuse a combat assignment."

555
00:53:53,003 --> 00:53:59,384
Well, there sure is a long line
of shit-hot rocket aces around here.

556
00:53:59,384 --> 00:54:01,595
Hey, Hot Dog.

557
00:54:01,845 --> 00:54:05,890
What the hell's "astronaut" mean anyway?

558
00:54:07,684 --> 00:54:10,561
Star voyager.

559
00:54:13,689 --> 00:54:17,234
Star voyager Gus Grissom.

560
00:54:18,194 --> 00:54:21,238
I like the sound of that.

561
00:54:21,488 --> 00:54:22,781
<i>Now your name is?</i>

562
00:54:23,031 --> 00:54:26,410
<i>My name, Jos Jimnez.</i>

563
00:54:27,536 --> 00:54:30,622
Who are we gonna get
to take on the Russians?

564
00:54:30,872 --> 00:54:36,085
Have you seen this Jos Jimnez?
He's a crack-up.

565
00:54:36,544 --> 00:54:42,091
<i>I am the chief astronaut
of the United States Interplanetary...</i>

566
00:54:47,555 --> 00:54:50,265
<i>My name, Jos Jimnez.</i>

567
00:54:50,516 --> 00:54:53,852
<i>Now I see you have some of
your space equipment with you.</i>

568
00:54:54,102 --> 00:54:56,646
<i>What is that called? The crash helmet?</i>

569
00:54:56,897 --> 00:54:58,690
<i>Oh, I hope not.</i>

570
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,525
Get that guy off.

571
00:55:00,775 --> 00:55:04,654
The country's already laughing at us.

572
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,824
This is the show I wanted you to see.

573
00:55:08,074 --> 00:55:10,952
Who, that kid?

574
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,830
<i>Winner of five
Distinguished Flying Crosses...</i>

575
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:19,835
<i>... and holder of the coast-to-coast,
nonstop, supersonic flight record...</i>

576
00:55:20,085 --> 00:55:22,337
<i>... from the U.S. Marine Corps...</i>

577
00:55:22,587 --> 00:55:23,797
<i>... Major John Glenn!</i>

578
00:55:24,047 --> 00:55:26,633
That guy.

579
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:33,348
<i>Can you tell us what's that song?</i>

580
00:55:34,098 --> 00:55:37,643
<i>Straighten Up and Fly Right.</i>

581
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:47,861
It's "Straighten Up and Fly Right".

582
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,906
He's not dumb.

583
00:55:56,578 --> 00:56:00,999
<i>Major, Eddie here has a little problem
with his girlfriend.</i>

584
00:56:01,249 --> 00:56:04,585
<i>Did you ever have a problem like that
when you were ten?</i>

585
00:56:04,836 --> 00:56:06,963
<i>Yes, I did, Bob.</i>

586
00:56:07,213 --> 00:56:09,507
<i>I liked a girl in my class, but...</i>

587
00:56:09,757 --> 00:56:12,593
<i>... the other guys liked her too
and she didn't pay attention.</i>

588
00:56:12,843 --> 00:56:15,888
<i>But I kept after her, Eddie.</i>

589
00:56:16,138 --> 00:56:18,348
<i>Did you finally get her to notice you?</i>

590
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:19,850
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

591
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:24,062
<i>In fact, I finally got her to marry me.</i>

592
00:56:27,482 --> 00:56:30,443
They love the guy.

593
00:56:46,166 --> 00:56:48,460
<i>Delta Charlie 9, you are clear to land...</i>

594
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:50,712
<i>... at 180 degrees.</i>

595
00:56:50,962 --> 00:56:55,300
<i>Jos Jimnez on approach.</i>

596
00:56:56,301 --> 00:56:58,886
<i>My name, Jos Jimnez.</i>

597
00:56:59,137 --> 00:57:03,808
<i>Yeah, Shepard, I forgot.
You are clear at 180 degrees.</i>

598
00:57:04,058 --> 00:57:07,728
<i>Some boys here want to talk to you
about being an astronaut.</i>

599
00:57:07,978 --> 00:57:13,025
<i>They want to make me an astronaut?
Oh, I hope not.</i>

600
00:57:23,493 --> 00:57:28,164
Are you sure the Navy's got good pilots?

601
00:57:28,414 --> 00:57:34,045
They call them aviators in the Navy.
They say they're better than pilots.

602
00:57:44,346 --> 00:57:48,558
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to meet Alan Shepard.

603
00:57:48,683 --> 00:57:50,935
I'd like you to meet Alan Shepard.

604
00:57:51,186 --> 00:57:54,647
Just the man we came to see.

605
00:58:00,069 --> 00:58:01,946
You've heard about our project.

606
00:58:02,196 --> 00:58:05,616
We're going up against the Russians.
It's got the highest...

607
00:58:05,866 --> 00:58:07,117
Priority.

608
00:58:07,368 --> 00:58:09,119
It's a hazardous...

609
00:58:09,369 --> 00:58:13,498
...undertaking. In fact,
it's extremely hazardous.

610
00:58:13,749 --> 00:58:18,378
It's so hazardous that
if you decide not to volunteer...

611
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:21,381
...it will not be held against you
in any way.

612
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:24,300
- Sounds dangerous.
- It is.

613
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:27,595
Count me in.

614
00:58:29,513 --> 00:58:33,934
There's nothing to worry about.
Absolutely nothing.

615
00:58:40,399 --> 00:58:43,151
Why are you doing this to me?

616
00:58:43,401 --> 00:58:48,281
I'm afraid there's no simple way
to explain that to you.

617
00:59:10,594 --> 00:59:14,306
Thank you, Number 21.

618
00:59:25,733 --> 00:59:29,778
Number 22, please.

619
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:33,031
You're gonna love it.

620
00:59:40,413 --> 00:59:43,958
Excuse me, are you John Glenn?

621
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:46,336
Scott Carpenter.

622
00:59:46,586 --> 00:59:49,339
I recognize you from those TV shows.
I like them.

623
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:51,340
I had a good time doing them.

624
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:56,137
I guess we're both here
for the same reason.

625
00:59:56,637 --> 00:59:59,056
You know what they've got planned?

626
00:59:59,306 --> 01:00:01,225
No. Let me check it out.

627
01:00:01,475 --> 01:00:03,268
What have you got scheduled?

628
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:08,190
We're not really free
to reveal all the testing.

629
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:12,193
I don't get this.

630
01:00:12,444 --> 01:00:15,488
Sending us down here
disguised as civilians.

631
01:00:15,738 --> 01:00:18,241
Come on, Gus, cut it out. What the hell...?

632
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:22,203
Hot Dog, this entire operation's
supposed to be hush-hush.

633
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:28,667
We got top-secret orders to blend in
with the patients. So shut up.

634
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:33,797
There might be Russian agents here.

635
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,510
They don't look very Russian to me, Gus.

636
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,222
All we got here is your local gentry, and...

637
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:46,184
...then you got Navy
and Marine pilots over here.

638
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:49,854
None of these guys is up
to Air Force standards.

639
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:54,441
I hear they got some 50-some guys
trying out for seven spots.

640
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:58,153
After they pick us three,
there's only gonna be four spots.

641
01:00:58,403 --> 01:01:00,906
Sounds right to me. Where do we go next?

642
01:01:01,156 --> 01:01:04,409
You go in that door.

643
01:01:06,995 --> 01:01:09,914
Who are you?

644
01:01:15,044 --> 01:01:19,507
My name, Jos Jimnez.

645
01:01:21,467 --> 01:01:24,011
You talking to us, buddy?

646
01:01:24,261 --> 01:01:28,932
All Air Force pilots go in that door.

647
01:01:29,182 --> 01:01:31,727
When they all go in...

648
01:01:31,977 --> 01:01:33,979
...they all look the same.

649
01:01:34,229 --> 01:01:37,273
But when they all come out...

650
01:01:37,524 --> 01:01:39,776
...they all look different.

651
01:01:40,026 --> 01:01:42,695
How's that?

652
01:01:43,154 --> 01:01:46,490
Fellow, I said how's that?

653
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:49,577
When they all come out...

654
01:01:49,827 --> 01:01:53,288
...they all look scared.

655
01:02:02,088 --> 01:02:05,091
"Buenos das", Gonzlez.

656
01:02:05,133 --> 01:02:07,886
"Buenos das" yourself.

657
01:02:08,136 --> 01:02:11,347
Would you come this way.

658
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:17,144
That guy didn't fool me a bit.

659
01:02:17,394 --> 01:02:18,854
That Mexican guy?

660
01:02:19,104 --> 01:02:22,816
That guy's Navy all the way.
There's another swabbo.

661
01:02:23,067 --> 01:02:25,777
I'll open the box a little so you can see.

662
01:02:26,028 --> 01:02:27,279
Don't put your fingers in there.

663
01:02:27,529 --> 01:02:31,741
This thing will bite them off. It's vicious.

664
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,747
Real swabbo sense of humor.

665
01:02:38,539 --> 01:02:43,210
Let's see what there is
to be scared about back here.

666
01:02:45,963 --> 01:02:50,926
The ball must be maintained
in the position between these two lines.

667
01:02:51,176 --> 01:02:52,886
You may begin... now.

668
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:56,681
The record is 91 seconds.

669
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:32,146
Ninety-three seconds. Read it and weep.

670
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:59,297
Terrific, Scott. Darn good!

671
01:04:59,547 --> 01:05:02,258
You were probably just getting warmed up.

672
01:05:02,508 --> 01:05:05,469
Next time I doubt I'd win.

673
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,012
I don't know about that.

674
01:05:07,263 --> 01:05:11,308
We're competing with Archie and Jughead.

675
01:07:08,418 --> 01:07:12,380
Let me out of here! Let me out!

676
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:37,821
Gus, I got this whole thing figured out.

677
01:07:38,071 --> 01:07:41,116
The drill here...

678
01:07:42,617 --> 01:07:48,623
The drill here is to see who can drill
the brains out of Nurse Murch.

679
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:51,834
You're nuts.

680
01:07:52,084 --> 01:07:55,421
She thinks we're all just
miserable pudknockers.

681
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:59,675
This is one fighter jock
who is not a miserable pudknocker.

682
01:07:59,925 --> 01:08:05,305
She's a woman,
susceptible to charms like all of the rest.

683
01:08:10,185 --> 01:08:11,895
You want what in there?

684
01:08:12,145 --> 01:08:14,772
Sperm.

685
01:08:15,315 --> 01:08:16,649
What for?

686
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:20,653
Sperm motility factors.

687
01:08:20,736 --> 01:08:23,447
Yeah, but, Nurse...

688
01:08:23,698 --> 01:08:27,159
...how am I supposed to...

689
01:08:27,952 --> 01:08:31,788
The best results seem to be obtained
through fantasization...

690
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:37,335
...accompanied by masturbation,
followed by ejaculation.

691
01:08:40,088 --> 01:08:43,424
That sounds easy enough.

692
01:08:43,675 --> 01:08:45,301
I'll tell you what.

693
01:08:45,551 --> 01:08:51,265
If I get stuck, you mind coming in
and helping me out a little bit?

694
01:08:57,187 --> 01:09:00,983
Please return it to the lab.

695
01:09:20,126 --> 01:09:23,837
Hey, cut out the humming in there.

696
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:54,241
Okay, knock it off in there.

697
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:05,168
Okay, Glenn, I know that's you.

698
01:10:05,418 --> 01:10:10,423
Just knock it off,
because I'm trying to concentrate in here.

699
01:10:47,082 --> 01:10:48,459
That was quick.

700
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:51,003
There's plenty more where that came from.

701
01:10:51,253 --> 01:10:53,297
You want to see me again?

702
01:10:53,547 --> 01:10:56,925
I'd like to meet your wife.

703
01:10:59,719 --> 01:11:02,764
You're married, aren't you?

704
01:11:03,014 --> 01:11:05,808
Yeah, sure, I'm married all right.

705
01:11:06,059 --> 01:11:07,310
Happily?

706
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,147
Yeah. A real stable relationship, too.

707
01:11:11,397 --> 01:11:14,733
I'd like to meet your wife.

708
01:11:17,987 --> 01:11:20,614
Tomorrow.

709
01:11:23,408 --> 01:11:24,826
Tomorrow's no good.

710
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:27,787
Tomorrow.

711
01:11:38,506 --> 01:11:41,801
I need you, Trudy.

712
01:11:46,138 --> 01:11:49,683
I'm talking about a whole new ball game.

713
01:11:49,933 --> 01:11:51,518
Fresh start.

714
01:11:51,768 --> 01:11:57,107
This astronaut thing is the best way
for us to move up that ladder.

715
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:01,694
If we play our cards right,
we go all the way to the top.

716
01:12:01,945 --> 01:12:04,697
We? You mean you.

717
01:12:04,947 --> 01:12:07,283
I mean we.

718
01:12:07,533 --> 01:12:10,619
We're a team.

719
01:12:13,497 --> 01:12:15,332
Have I ever let you down?

720
01:12:15,582 --> 01:12:18,043
Yeah.

721
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:29,179
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?

722
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:37,353
You're looking at him.

723
01:13:03,169 --> 01:13:08,340
You're all set. I told her you were stable,
well-adjusted, attentive, persevering.

724
01:13:08,591 --> 01:13:11,093
- I lied.
- That a girl.

725
01:13:11,343 --> 01:13:12,428
What'd she say?

726
01:13:12,678 --> 01:13:14,096
She laughed.

727
01:13:14,346 --> 01:13:16,431
She knows you too well, Gordo.

728
01:13:16,682 --> 01:13:21,728
Let's face it. Some women
just have a problem with men.

729
01:13:21,728 --> 01:13:25,064
Yeah, I know.

730
01:13:29,736 --> 01:13:31,904
<i>At secret locations throughout America...</i>

731
01:13:32,154 --> 01:13:34,824
<i>... 56 of our greatest pilots
are at this moment...</i>

732
01:13:35,074 --> 01:13:39,244
<i>... vying to be one of the first men
to go into space.</i>

733
01:13:39,495 --> 01:13:41,997
<i>These are the most up-to-date
tests imaginable.</i>

734
01:13:42,247 --> 01:13:47,627
<i>This is the most rigorous physical testing
ever done to human beings.</i>

735
01:13:48,879 --> 01:13:55,093
<i>They're being subjected to every stress
our doctors and engineers can invent.</i>

736
01:13:57,553 --> 01:14:01,974
<i>These men are preparing themselves
for the ordeal of capsule life.</i>

737
01:14:02,224 --> 01:14:06,729
<i>They will be guiding a new machine
through a hostile environment.</i>

738
01:14:06,979 --> 01:14:10,524
<i>They will be faced with emergencies
no man can foresee.</i>

739
01:14:10,774 --> 01:14:14,986
<i>Many are called, but few will be chosen.</i>

740
01:14:15,237 --> 01:14:20,450
<i>These are men who will have to face
any danger for their country.</i>

741
01:14:21,493 --> 01:14:27,582
<i>No individual will have ever been
so adequately prepared for an event.</i>

742
01:14:27,957 --> 01:14:31,460
<i>Each man knows
that whoever survives this competition...</i>

743
01:14:31,711 --> 01:14:36,590
<i>... is destined to become
a legend in his own time.</i>

744
01:14:48,852 --> 01:14:50,770
Here, hold this.

745
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,855
And hold this like this.

746
01:14:53,106 --> 01:14:56,067
When the clamp is released,
the balloon inside you deflates.

747
01:14:56,317 --> 01:14:57,818
Deflates? Where's the john?

748
01:14:58,069 --> 01:15:03,616
Two floors up. Gonzlez will take
you there, but wait here with him.

749
01:15:08,495 --> 01:15:11,748
How's it going, Gonzlez?

750
01:15:43,778 --> 01:15:46,614
Faster!

751
01:15:59,084 --> 01:16:00,461
Good day, Commander.

752
01:16:00,711 --> 01:16:04,298
You prick!

753
01:16:07,509 --> 01:16:10,387
Push the button.

754
01:16:45,628 --> 01:16:50,633
Me and my friends think your
Jos Jimnez imitation is A-okay.

755
01:16:50,883 --> 01:16:54,136
But what you're doing with it is b-a-d.

756
01:16:54,386 --> 01:16:58,349
You're right, you're absolutely right.

757
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:11,402
You ever have any explosions doing this?

758
01:17:11,653 --> 01:17:15,198
All the time. It's a mess.

759
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:20,453
Tell me something else, Mr. Gonzlez.

760
01:17:20,536 --> 01:17:22,163
How am I doing?

761
01:17:22,413 --> 01:17:27,751
I think you're gonna make it.
I think you're gonna be an astronaut.

762
01:17:50,606 --> 01:17:53,025
<i>After a long...</i>

763
01:17:53,275 --> 01:17:57,488
<i>... and unprecedented
series of evaluations...</i>

764
01:17:57,613 --> 01:18:00,949
<i>... which told our medical scientists...</i>

765
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:07,455
<i>... of their superb adaptability
to their upcoming flight...</i>

766
01:18:07,747 --> 01:18:11,334
<i>... it is my pleasure to introduce to you...</i>

767
01:18:11,584 --> 01:18:14,086
<i>... seven Americans...</i>

768
01:18:14,337 --> 01:18:17,381
<i>... gentlemen all.</i>

769
01:18:17,757 --> 01:18:21,969
<i>Virgil I. "Gus" Grissom!</i>

770
01:18:24,096 --> 01:18:27,808
<i>Leroy G. Cooper!</i>

771
01:18:28,058 --> 01:18:31,686
<i>Donald K. Slayton!</i>

772
01:18:31,937 --> 01:18:35,690
<i>John H. Glenn, Junior!</i>

773
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:38,693
<i>Malcolm S. Carpenter!</i>

774
01:18:38,943 --> 01:18:42,196
<i>Alan B. Shepard, Junior!</i>

775
01:18:42,446 --> 01:18:47,159
<i>Walter M. Schirra, Junior!</i>

776
01:18:47,284 --> 01:18:52,122
<i>America's Mercury astronauts!</i>

777
01:19:04,968 --> 01:19:07,053
Holy shit!

778
01:19:07,303 --> 01:19:11,182
Smile, Gus. We're heroes.

779
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,310
Yeager ought to see this.

780
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,688
Seven rookies being installed
as the hottest fliers...

781
01:19:17,938 --> 01:19:23,360
...and they haven't done a thing
but show up for a press conference.

782
01:19:29,824 --> 01:19:34,412
<i>Following the distribution of the kits,
those of you who have p.m. Deadlines...</i>

783
01:19:34,662 --> 01:19:36,998
<i>... better dash to your phones.</i>

784
01:19:37,248 --> 01:19:41,877
<i>Now we'll have some questions
from the press, please.</i>

785
01:19:43,504 --> 01:19:46,298
<i>I'd like to know
whether your wives and children...</i>

786
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:50,260
<i>... had anything to say about this.</i>

787
01:19:56,099 --> 01:19:59,227
<i>Mine think it's fine.</i>

788
01:20:09,487 --> 01:20:12,573
<i>They're all for it.</i>

789
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:26,002
<i>I don't think any of us could go on
with something like this...</i>

790
01:20:26,253 --> 01:20:30,757
<i>... if we didn't have
pretty good backing at home.</i>

791
01:20:34,886 --> 01:20:37,680
<i>My wife's attitude towards this
has been the same...</i>

792
01:20:37,930 --> 01:20:40,683
<i>... as it's been all along through my flying.</i>

793
01:20:40,933 --> 01:20:43,978
<i>If it's what I want to do, she's behind it.</i>

794
01:20:44,228 --> 01:20:48,982
<i>And, by golly, my kids are, too.
100 percent.</i>

795
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:57,782
I don't believe this.

796
01:20:58,032 --> 01:21:02,662
But look at them out there.
They're eating it up.

797
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:07,458
<i>I was brought up believing
that you are placed on earth...</i>

798
01:21:07,708 --> 01:21:11,712
<i>... more or less with a 50-50 proposition.</i>

799
01:21:11,962 --> 01:21:14,715
<i>This is what I still believe.</i>

800
01:21:14,965 --> 01:21:18,260
<i>We're placed here with certain talents
and capabilities...</i>

801
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:24,307
<i>... and it's up to each one of us
to use those talents as best we can.</i>

802
01:21:26,142 --> 01:21:29,145
<i>And if we use our talents properly...</i>

803
01:21:29,395 --> 01:21:33,232
<i>... I think there is a power
greater than us that will place...</i>

804
01:21:33,482 --> 01:21:37,236
<i>... the opportunities in our way.</i>

805
01:21:42,533 --> 01:21:45,285
<i>When I think of Orville and Wilbur Wright...</i>

806
01:21:45,535 --> 01:21:47,996
<i>... standing on a hill
at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina...</i>

807
01:21:48,246 --> 01:21:53,960
<i>... tossing a coin to see which one
would take the first airplane flight...</i>

808
01:21:54,002 --> 01:21:58,131
<i>... and then I think of us here today...</i>

809
01:22:01,592 --> 01:22:03,636
<i>... I thank God I live in a country...</i>

810
01:22:03,886 --> 01:22:08,724
<i>... where the best and finest in a man
can be brought out.</i>

811
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:25,239
<i>I'd like to second some of the things
Mr. Glenn has said here.</i>

812
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:30,494
<i>I think that we are all very,
very fortunate...</i>

813
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:33,831
<i>... that we have been,
should we say, "blessed"...</i>

814
01:22:34,081 --> 01:22:36,917
<i>... with the talents for something like this.</i>

815
01:22:37,167 --> 01:22:41,380
<i>And I think that we would be most remiss
in our duty indeed...</i>

816
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:45,509
<i>... if we did not volunteer
for something as important as this is...</i>

817
01:22:45,759 --> 01:22:47,260
<i>... for our country...</i>

818
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:51,598
<i>... and to the world in general right now.</i>

819
01:22:54,767 --> 01:22:58,104
One of our Air Force boys.

820
01:22:58,187 --> 01:23:01,023
<i>Don't you agree, Deke?</i>

821
01:23:01,273 --> 01:23:03,609
<i>I absolutely agree with Gordo.</i>

822
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:06,320
<i>But we're not saying anything new.</i>

823
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:08,947
<i>We're just saying the same things...</i>

824
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:15,036
<i>... that need to be said again
and again with fierce conviction.</i>

825
01:23:22,001 --> 01:23:26,214
Can you tell us if any of you
go to church regularly?

826
01:23:26,464 --> 01:23:29,175
<i>As far as church goes...</i>

827
01:23:29,425 --> 01:23:32,553
<i>... I attend regularly.</i>

828
01:23:35,305 --> 01:23:39,518
Which one of you will be
the first into space?

829
01:23:55,658 --> 01:23:59,370
<i>The best will be first.</i>

830
01:24:16,094 --> 01:24:19,055
Share it, brother.

831
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:22,725
Fucking A, bubba.

832
01:24:24,185 --> 01:24:28,397
This is for America's "Life" magazine.

833
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:39,199
These are the greatest pilots in America.

834
01:24:39,282 --> 01:24:41,242
How much do they make?

835
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:43,411
$7,000-$8,000 a year?

836
01:24:43,661 --> 01:24:46,122
- Tops.
- At the most.

837
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:49,959
With this one deal
I'm giving them $500,000...

838
01:24:50,209 --> 01:24:53,671
...split seven ways over three years.

839
01:24:53,921 --> 01:24:56,882
How does that sound?

840
01:24:57,132 --> 01:25:01,512
Now I want them all to meet my people
who will write their true stories.

841
01:25:01,762 --> 01:25:05,891
These stories will appear in "Life"
under their own by-lines.

842
01:25:06,141 --> 01:25:07,184
For example...

843
01:25:07,434 --> 01:25:10,437
..."by Betty Grissom"...

844
01:25:10,687 --> 01:25:12,230
...or, "by...

845
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:16,025
...Virgil I. Grissom."

846
01:25:19,904 --> 01:25:20,780
What was that?

847
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:21,906
Gus.

848
01:25:22,156 --> 01:25:25,826
Nobody calls me by that other name.

849
01:25:26,076 --> 01:25:27,703
Gus?

850
01:25:27,953 --> 01:25:31,873
An astronaut named Gus?

851
01:25:33,875 --> 01:25:35,127
What's your middle name?

852
01:25:35,377 --> 01:25:37,963
Ivan.

853
01:25:41,883 --> 01:25:44,427
Maybe...

854
01:25:45,053 --> 01:25:46,679
..."Gus" isn't so bad.

855
01:25:46,929 --> 01:25:50,182
Might be something there.

856
01:25:50,933 --> 01:25:54,812
All right, you can be Gus.

857
01:25:57,272 --> 01:26:00,692
I bet for all that money
they could call you Virgil.

858
01:26:00,942 --> 01:26:04,154
They sure could me.

859
01:26:09,117 --> 01:26:11,995
Well, what's with her?

860
01:26:12,245 --> 01:26:15,331
She seems snobby.

861
01:26:15,456 --> 01:26:17,124
I don't get it.

862
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:21,921
I get it. She's "Mrs. Clean Marine".

863
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:37,185
I'm going to the Cape tomorrow.

864
01:26:38,811 --> 01:26:43,024
I wish to heck it wasn't off-limits to wives.

865
01:26:43,399 --> 01:26:47,278
There's so much work to do, anyway.
More tests...

866
01:26:47,528 --> 01:26:48,571
...training...

867
01:26:48,821 --> 01:26:51,532
...studying.

868
01:26:57,829 --> 01:27:01,541
What about after?

869
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:04,669
After hours I'll run a lot.

870
01:27:04,919 --> 01:27:07,422
I'm going to get up to five miles a day.

871
01:27:07,672 --> 01:27:10,675
There's a beautiful, long beach there.

872
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:13,761
It's called Cocoa Beach.

873
01:27:14,011 --> 01:27:17,056
You can run forever.

874
01:27:17,681 --> 01:27:20,100
Scott Carpenter will run with me.

875
01:27:20,351 --> 01:27:22,436
He's a good guy.

876
01:27:22,686 --> 01:27:25,897
He's real philosophical.

877
01:27:28,191 --> 01:27:31,069
What about...?

878
01:27:32,195 --> 01:27:38,409
The others want to get the job done and
keep the Mickey Mouse to a minimum.

879
01:27:39,827 --> 01:27:42,913
They're good men.

880
01:27:43,164 --> 01:27:45,291
Good men.

881
01:27:45,541 --> 01:27:49,753
They'll give 100 percent
when the time comes.

882
01:27:54,216 --> 01:27:57,928
Guess they think I'm kind of a...

883
01:27:58,261 --> 01:28:01,431
...gung-ho type.

884
01:28:01,764 --> 01:28:04,767
"Eddie Attaboy."

885
01:28:05,184 --> 01:28:08,229
"Harry Hairshirt."

886
01:28:10,523 --> 01:28:13,400
What, you agree?

887
01:28:14,985 --> 01:28:16,070
You agree?

888
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,156
My own wife.

889
01:28:19,448 --> 01:28:23,160
Do you think I'm a "Dudley Doright"?

890
01:28:25,829 --> 01:28:28,164
That's me, I guess.

891
01:28:28,415 --> 01:28:30,291
A lonely beacon of restraint...

892
01:28:30,542 --> 01:28:34,921
...and self-sacrifice
in a squall of car-crazies.

893
01:28:47,558 --> 01:28:52,771
It's important to America
to get a man up there first.

894
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:59,444
I plan to be the first man
to ride the rocket.

895
01:31:50,229 --> 01:31:53,274
<i>What is the most important thing
in rocket travel?</i>

896
01:31:53,524 --> 01:31:56,986
<i>To me the most important thing...</i>

897
01:31:57,236 --> 01:31:59,321
<i>... is the blast-off.</i>

898
01:31:59,572 --> 01:32:03,575
<i>I always take a blast before I take off.</i>

899
01:32:04,243 --> 01:32:07,871
<i>Otherwise I wouldn't go near it.</i>

900
01:32:13,877 --> 01:32:17,046
He loves Ed Sullivan.

901
01:32:46,532 --> 01:32:50,745
Four down, three to go.

902
01:33:28,572 --> 01:33:32,659
I don't want anything to put this program
in a bad light.

903
01:33:32,909 --> 01:33:37,080
We have the opportunity of a lifetime
and I'm sorry, but I won't stand by...

904
01:33:37,330 --> 01:33:40,250
...and let other people compromise
the whole darned thing!

905
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:44,337
You know and I know this could lead
to something very unfortunate.

906
01:33:44,587 --> 01:33:47,840
I'm talking about the playing around
that's going on.

907
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:50,426
I'm talking about the young girls.

908
01:33:50,676 --> 01:33:52,219
I'm talking about the cookies.

909
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:55,514
I'm talking about keeping our pants zipped
and our wicks dry.

910
01:33:55,764 --> 01:33:58,725
Mr. Glenn, you are way out of line.

911
01:33:58,976 --> 01:34:03,772
I advise you not to try to foist your
moral views on anyone else in this group.

912
01:34:04,022 --> 01:34:06,149
Each man here has volunteered to do a job.

913
01:34:06,399 --> 01:34:09,194
Each man is devoting long hours
of training...

914
01:34:09,444 --> 01:34:12,530
...and doing many things above
and beyond the call of duty...

915
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,699
...such as morale tours of factories...

916
01:34:14,949 --> 01:34:16,867
Such as bringing girls up to your room?

917
01:34:17,118 --> 01:34:19,495
And forgoing any orderly family life.

918
01:34:19,745 --> 01:34:22,539
Mr. Glenn, as long
as a man uses good sense...

919
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:26,835
...what he does with his wick
is his own business!

920
01:34:27,085 --> 01:34:29,671
I'm from "Life" magazine.
I'm not with these people.

921
01:34:29,921 --> 01:34:34,676
You can't go in.
They're discussing scientific problems.

922
01:34:37,512 --> 01:34:40,556
John's right. Whether we like it or not
we're public figures.

923
01:34:40,807 --> 01:34:43,351
Whether we deserve it or not,
people look up to us.

924
01:34:43,601 --> 01:34:45,770
We have a tremendous responsibility.

925
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:50,733
You can't tell a pilot what to do
when he's not flying.

926
01:34:54,278 --> 01:34:56,196
Wait a minute. You got it all wrong.

927
01:34:56,446 --> 01:34:58,490
The issue here ain't pussy.

928
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:00,492
The issue here is monkey.

929
01:35:00,742 --> 01:35:05,413
Us. We are the monkey.

930
01:35:07,081 --> 01:35:09,751
What Gus is saying is
that we're missing the point.

931
01:35:10,001 --> 01:35:14,213
Gus is saying that we all heard rumors
they want to send a monkey up first.

932
01:35:14,463 --> 01:35:17,716
None of us wants them to send
a monkey up to do a man's work.

933
01:35:17,967 --> 01:35:19,551
What Gus is saying is that...

934
01:35:19,802 --> 01:35:23,680
...what they're trying to do to us
is send a man up to do a monkey's work.

935
01:35:23,931 --> 01:35:26,892
Us. A bunch of
college-trained chimpanzees.

936
01:35:27,142 --> 01:35:30,604
What Gus is saying is that
we've got to change things around here.

937
01:35:30,854 --> 01:35:33,314
He's saying that we are pilots.

938
01:35:33,565 --> 01:35:36,734
We know more about what we need
to fly than anybody else.

939
01:35:36,985 --> 01:35:39,904
So what we have to do
is alter the experiment.

940
01:35:40,154 --> 01:35:43,824
It comes down to who is going
to control this thing from here on.

941
01:35:44,075 --> 01:35:49,455
What Gus is saying here is
that we've got to stick together on this.

942
01:36:55,767 --> 01:36:58,186
These tests were designed...

943
01:36:58,436 --> 01:37:01,356
...to decondition, to desensitize...

944
01:37:01,606 --> 01:37:04,609
...to adapt out fears.

945
01:37:04,859 --> 01:37:09,196
Since we have developed
a fully automated vehicle...

946
01:37:09,447 --> 01:37:11,615
...all we seek from the occupants...

947
01:37:11,866 --> 01:37:14,201
...of the capsule is data.

948
01:37:14,451 --> 01:37:16,954
The so-called astronaut...

949
01:37:17,204 --> 01:37:22,000
...would merely be a redundant component.

950
01:37:23,543 --> 01:37:24,669
And here you can see...

951
01:37:24,919 --> 01:37:28,673
...these chimps are capable of many
of the same tasks as men.

952
01:37:28,923 --> 01:37:32,677
And they are much more cooperative.

953
01:37:35,304 --> 01:37:38,974
<i>They are being put through every phase
of the astronaut training.</i>

954
01:37:39,225 --> 01:37:42,895
<i>As far as we are concerned,
the question still remains:</i>

955
01:37:43,145 --> 01:37:45,147
<i>Which one will be first?</i>

956
01:37:45,397 --> 01:37:46,815
<i>The man or...</i>

957
01:37:47,065 --> 01:37:49,067
<i>... the monkey?</i>

958
01:37:49,317 --> 01:37:52,070
<i>We shall see.</i>

959
01:38:22,015 --> 01:38:25,268
Take it easy with that.

960
01:38:32,149 --> 01:38:35,069
- Where are you putting the window?
- Window?

961
01:38:35,319 --> 01:38:36,320
There is no window.

962
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:38,864
No window?

963
01:38:39,114 --> 01:38:41,867
What about the hatch?

964
01:38:42,117 --> 01:38:45,162
We need a hatch with explosive bolts,
that we can open ourselves.

965
01:38:45,412 --> 01:38:47,747
There's something you don't understand.

966
01:38:47,998 --> 01:38:50,333
This is the final form of the capsule.

967
01:38:50,583 --> 01:38:51,668
No hatch.

968
01:38:51,918 --> 01:38:54,796
What would happen
if the automatic controls went out?

969
01:38:55,046 --> 01:38:58,216
With backups, checks,
this would not happen.

970
01:38:58,466 --> 01:39:00,801
I said, what would happen if it did?

971
01:39:01,052 --> 01:39:02,595
The pilot would have to fly it back.

972
01:39:02,845 --> 01:39:05,639
This is the way it is.

973
01:39:05,889 --> 01:39:08,976
I wonder how the press will feel about this.

974
01:39:09,226 --> 01:39:13,647
The press? What does the press
have to say about this?

975
01:39:13,897 --> 01:39:17,901
Do you boys know
what makes this bird go up?

976
01:39:18,151 --> 01:39:20,445
Funding makes this bird go up.

977
01:39:20,695 --> 01:39:23,489
That's right. No bucks...

978
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:25,158
...no Buck Rogers.

979
01:39:25,408 --> 01:39:29,495
And the press over there...

980
01:39:35,626 --> 01:39:37,503
They all want to see Buck Rogers.

981
01:39:37,753 --> 01:39:39,630
And that's us.

982
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,214
Buck Rogers.

983
01:39:41,465 --> 01:39:44,509
You see, those fellows over there
have been making us out...

984
01:39:44,759 --> 01:39:48,805
...as the seven finest and bravest pilots
in all America.

985
01:39:49,055 --> 01:39:52,600
If the story would come out in the press...

986
01:39:52,850 --> 01:39:55,144
...that we are not allowed to fly as pilots...

987
01:39:55,394 --> 01:39:58,439
We want a window.

988
01:40:00,232 --> 01:40:02,192
There could maybe be...

989
01:40:02,443 --> 01:40:07,114
...in future capsules a window...

990
01:40:07,155 --> 01:40:08,365
...here.

991
01:40:08,615 --> 01:40:11,326
No, that's where the hatch
with explosive bolts goes.

992
01:40:11,576 --> 01:40:15,163
The hatch with the explosive...

993
01:40:17,123 --> 01:40:20,460
There could be a hatch
with explosive bolts on the capsule.

994
01:40:20,710 --> 01:40:23,379
That is a spacecraft, sir.

995
01:40:23,629 --> 01:40:27,508
We do not refer to it as a "capsule".

996
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:31,178
Spacecraft.

997
01:40:32,471 --> 01:40:35,224
A hatch with explosive bolts on the...

998
01:40:35,474 --> 01:40:38,351
...spacecraft.

999
01:40:39,769 --> 01:40:43,314
And there will be pitch and yaw thrusters
to enable the occupant...

1000
01:40:43,565 --> 01:40:46,192
The pilot.

1001
01:40:46,734 --> 01:40:49,737
Astronaut-pilot?

1002
01:40:51,572 --> 01:40:53,741
The astronaut...

1003
01:40:53,991 --> 01:40:56,702
...pilot...

1004
01:40:56,952 --> 01:40:58,787
...to have some...

1005
01:40:59,038 --> 01:41:01,832
...to have...

1006
01:41:03,625 --> 01:41:06,378
...control...

1007
01:41:07,212 --> 01:41:10,757
...of the re-entry procedures.

1008
01:41:14,177 --> 01:41:15,553
We appreciate it.

1009
01:41:15,803 --> 01:41:21,601
You wouldn't mind if we had the press
take a few photos of us, would you?

1010
01:41:53,672 --> 01:41:59,386
Which one of you is going to be
the first one to be launched into space?

1011
01:42:34,628 --> 01:42:36,546
Here he is.

1012
01:42:36,796 --> 01:42:40,216
Captain Ham.

1013
01:42:40,675 --> 01:42:44,887
Grinning like a possum
eating a sweet potato.

1014
01:42:46,013 --> 01:42:50,768
Does he look like the kind of guy
who'd put doo-doo in the capsule?

1015
01:42:51,018 --> 01:42:53,687
Ham in a can.

1016
01:42:54,563 --> 01:42:57,858
America's first astronaut. Look at him!

1017
01:42:58,108 --> 01:43:04,531
You take a monkey like this,
you can make him into a great astronaut.
