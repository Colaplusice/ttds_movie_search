1
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,799
Cambodia.

2
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:36,605
To many Westerners,
it seemed a paradise.

3
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:39,832
Another world, a secret world.

4
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:43,902
But the war in neighboring
Vietnam burst its borders...

5
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:47,476
...and the fighting soon spread
to neutral Cambodia.

6
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:51,448
In 1973, I went to cover
this sideshow struggle...

7
00:00:51,647 --> 00:00:54,614
...as foreign correspondent
of The New York Times.

8
00:00:54,977 --> 00:00:57,628
It was there, amidst the fighting...

9
00:00:57,826 --> 00:01:01,019
...between government troops
and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas...

10
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:04,662
...that I met my guide
and interpreter, Dith Pran...

11
00:01:04,863 --> 00:01:07,733
...a man who was to change my life...

12
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:10,780
...in a country that I grew to love
and pity.

13
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,300
So here we go
with Voice of America...

14
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:24,405
...news for Southeast Asia.

15
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:28,565
It's 6:45 and a partly cloudy
morning here.

16
00:01:28,764 --> 00:01:30,936
Clouds too in Washington.

17
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,746
President Nixon announced he'll
address the nation on Watergate...

18
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:36,731
...within the next few days.

19
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:39,445
The speech will be Nixon's
first since May.

20
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:45,076
The scandal has caused resignations
and paralyzed the White House staff.

21
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:48,727
It has also led to intense
confrontation and perhaps...

22
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:51,675
...a constitutional crisis
with Senate investigators...

23
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:54,389
...and a special
Watergate prosecutor.

24
00:01:54,589 --> 00:01:57,819
The speech was announced
after the Gallup Poll disclosed...

25
00:01:58,013 --> 00:02:01,722
...that Mr. Nixon's popularity
had fallen to the lowest point...

26
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:04,602
...for an American President
in 20 years.

27
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:18,579
A Supreme Court judge,
William O. Douglas...

28
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:21,627
...has ruled against an appeal
by the Administration...

29
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,412
...for a stay of the injunction...

30
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,960
...on further U.S. Bombing
missions in Cambodia.

31
00:02:27,164 --> 00:02:30,034
Congress has already ruled
these bombings illegal...

32
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:34,328
...and they should cease in one
week's time on August the 15th.

33
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,815
Let's go, Sarun!
To the hospital!

34
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:17,042
Information. Information.

35
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:21,977
Air Cambodia regret delays of arrival
of flight number 125...

36
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:25,650
...from Bangkok because
of bad weather.

37
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:48,242
Mister, you want taxi?

38
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,613
Mister, you want taxi?
Good taxi.

39
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:19,952
Shut the fucking blinds, will you?

40
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:25,774
What's all this shit?

41
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:30,035
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:34,038
I thought you were the houseboy.
I was developing some film.

43
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,934
If you're gonna yell, I'll come back.
I'm not feeling good.

44
00:04:38,135 --> 00:04:40,471
Don't want to yell.
I want to be in a good mood.

45
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:43,477
The plane was late, no car.
I had to take a taxi here.

46
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:45,941
All I want to do is work.
I got you.

47
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:57,748
What the fuck is that on your head?

48
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,497
It's a sanitary napkin.
I had it soaked in ice.

49
00:05:05,078 --> 00:05:07,633
Syd Schanberg.
Is Pran there?

50
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:11,469
No, I just came from the airport.

51
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:15,241
Well, if he comes in,
would you tell him I'm here?

52
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:17,963
I'll be at the Caf Central, tell him.

53
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,369
Thanks a lot.

54
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,644
What do you want to eat?

55
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:40,496
Want some eggs?

56
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:44,073
I can't. Somebody told me they faint
with fright when you cook them.

57
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:46,413
- What do you want to eat?
- What are you having?

58
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:48,107
I'm having a caf complet.

59
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:50,994
I'll have that. And some aspirin.

60
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:01,837
Anything I eat has got to be
absolutely dead.

61
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:03,855
That's why I can never eat an oyster.

62
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:07,250
I read somewhere that they put...

63
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:12,973
...that lemon juice on them
just to stun them. You know?

64
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:14,284
What's the difference?

65
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:19,953
An unconscious oyster's just as
horrible as the fucker wide awake...

66
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:35,984
- My God! Look at this.
- Did you see that?

67
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:37,454
What was it? A rocket?

68
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:40,236
I don't know.
I saw a guy on a motorbike.

69
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:50,132
I've been looking for you.

70
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:51,818
I left a message for you.

71
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:53,956
I didn't get it. I took a cab.

72
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:56,977
- There is a big accident right now.
- What?

73
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,400
I think U.S. Drop many big bombs
on little city.

74
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,782
- U.S. Bombs? You're sure?
- I think many dead.

75
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:06,372
- Does anybody else know about it?
- Nothing at all.

76
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:08,327
We're going.

77
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:10,982
Not possible right now, Sydney.
Too dangerous.

78
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,916
Where you going, Schanberg?

79
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:42,798
Neak Luong.

80
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,202
Neak Luong's closed.

81
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,010
Don't give me that, Reeves.
You got nothing to say about this.

82
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:51,556
I got a right to go wherever I like
in this sad little country.

83
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:56,461
That's the law. You impede me, you're
breaking the Cooper/Church Amendment!

84
00:07:56,655 --> 00:07:59,406
Well, up the Cooper/Church
Amendment's ass!

85
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:02,981
Let's go!

86
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:15,492
So how can I help you, Mr. Schanberg?

87
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:24,079
I'm looking for information on why
my airplane was delayed this morning.

88
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:27,462
- Your plane was delayed?
- That's right.

89
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:30,826
I don't know. Maybe it's
bad weather. Your flight's...

90
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:32,995
You don't know anything about it?

91
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:34,722
No, I don't.

92
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,129
All right.

93
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:40,290
Then I'd like you
to listen to something...

94
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:42,436
...and then I'd like a comment.

95
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:46,341
This morning, for reasons beyond
anybody's control...

96
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,471
...I spend two hours in Bangkok
staring at a seat belt sign.

97
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:52,164
Meanwhile, my sources tell me...

98
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:56,008
...two Army helicopters are landing
here, just across the airfield.

99
00:08:56,558 --> 00:08:59,688
Half the ambulances in Phnom Penh
are waiting there to meet them.

100
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:04,068
And now there's a rumor that
the U.S. Air Force dropped a bomb...

101
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:06,089
...or several bombs, on Neak Luong.

102
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:09,317
That's a rumor, and I'm not gonna
comment on a rumor.

103
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:13,410
I just want to know if that's the
reason why my airplane was delayed!

104
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,061
No comment.

105
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:20,103
How many killed?

106
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:24,295
How many wounded?

107
00:09:29,643 --> 00:09:32,261
Thank you for your cooperation,
Major Reeves.

108
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:38,503
When I scrape this story out, I will
no doubt be quoting you in full!

109
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,705
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:21,258 --> 00:10:23,144
This is just not good enough.

111
00:10:23,337 --> 00:10:25,247
This is a big story...

112
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:29,508
...a major story, you understand that?
We've got to get down there!

113
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:31,713
- I know, but...
- I don't want to hear "no"!

114
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:33,823
I want to get down that river!

115
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:35,685
We should be down there now!

116
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:48,835
I'll be here.

117
00:10:51,304 --> 00:10:52,735
Good night, Sydney.

118
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,168
- Messages?
- No, sir.

119
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:04,637
No, sir.

120
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,700
I'd talk, but it's been
a heavy day and I've got to go.

121
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:12,264
Let's get together again soon, okay?

122
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:13,764
- Bob?
- See you.

123
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,142
Bob?

124
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:18,107
Hello, Sydney. Good night, Sydney.

125
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:21,378
- Listen, I can't talk with you.
- You can talk to me.

126
00:11:21,577 --> 00:11:24,423
The embassy is jittery.
Get information from a press officer.

127
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:26,819
Let's not start insulting each other.

128
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:30,588
Good night, Sydney.

129
00:11:31,462 --> 00:11:32,870
All right, good night.

130
00:11:38,118 --> 00:11:39,908
You've heard of pilot error?

131
00:11:40,104 --> 00:11:41,531
Computer malfunction?

132
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,780
They screwed up on the coordinates.

133
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:47,588
A single B-52 dropped
its entire load on Neak Luong.

134
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:51,842
There's a homing beacon
in the middle of the town.

135
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,291
- Casualties?
- You'll be briefed tomorrow.

136
00:11:55,491 --> 00:12:00,002
We estimate 55 military,
something like 35 civilians.

137
00:12:01,382 --> 00:12:02,558
How many?

138
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,554
I hear it's in the hundreds.
Don't quote me on that.

139
00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:10,881
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath

140
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:14,047
When the Khmer Rouge hit the town?

141
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:17,086
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath...?

142
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:21,788
Beer! We haven't had this
for four weeks.

143
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,003
New York Times probably
had it flown in.

144
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:27,843
- They keep it in their suite.
- We got a cellar. Don't you know?

145
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:30,404
Americans take themselves so seriously.

146
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:35,201
Don't be hard on the man. He's just
trying to get to the top of the heap.

147
00:12:35,397 --> 00:12:38,843
We'll just have to pay more to get
our telexes to the top of the heap.

148
00:12:39,046 --> 00:12:41,466
The man has just bought you a beer.
Now drink up.

149
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:42,682
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Syd.

150
00:12:42,883 --> 00:12:44,792
- Enjoy it.
- Off to see the telex operator?

151
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,297
- New York Times goes to bed early.
- Sure!

152
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:51,613
Khmer Rouge in the sunset

153
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:55,298
The Yanks all at sea...

154
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,986
- All right?
- Very possible.

155
00:13:02,118 --> 00:13:03,521
Let's go then!

156
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:12,630
This is good work.

157
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:49,273
- How much?
- Hundred fifty.

158
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:57,268
One hundred!

159
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:04,479
- All right?
- All right.

160
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,626
Nice going, Pran.

161
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:12,535
- What is he saying?
- He wants you to look at his family.

162
00:15:12,731 --> 00:15:16,989
To take a photograph and help him
because his child was wounded.

163
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:44,436
Tell me what she's saying.

164
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,080
She needs help.

165
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,391
Her shop was destroyed last night.

166
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:56,925
Her husband killed.

167
00:15:57,118 --> 00:15:58,292
How many bombs?

168
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:01,368
She doesn't know.

169
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,370
Does she know where the hospital is?

170
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:07,352
"Just over there."

171
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,542
She wants to know,
"Did someone arrest the pilot?"

172
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:20,757
Mister, you wanna buy?
Mister, you wanna buy?

173
00:16:21,116 --> 00:16:24,213
- One dollar? You wanna buy?
- I'm out of film. I'm sorry.

174
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:28,183
Ask her how many kids she's got
in her family.

175
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,231
"Five."

176
00:16:30,682 --> 00:16:33,016
Her husband was killed already.

177
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:38,357
What's this?

178
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,502
What are these guys over here?

179
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:48,408
In the jeep, prisoners.
Khmer Rouge prisoners.

180
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:12,494
They kill a lot of villagers.

181
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:15,312
She says Khmer Rouge soak rags
in gasoline...

182
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:17,454
...and push them down
villagers' throat...

183
00:17:17,655 --> 00:17:19,564
...then set the rags alight.

184
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,913
Film! No film!

185
00:17:21,112 --> 00:17:22,540
I know there's no film.

186
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:23,824
No camera!

187
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:26,063
No camera!

188
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:27,537
It's all right.

189
00:17:30,393 --> 00:17:31,767
Just take it easy.

190
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:38,992
Tell them we're jour...

191
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:49,623
Come on! Get in!

192
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:33,548
I'm worried.

193
00:18:34,934 --> 00:18:37,237
I'm the guy who bring you over here.

194
00:18:37,974 --> 00:18:40,113
They accuse me and they arrest me.

195
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,051
How can they arrest you?
You're already arrested.

196
00:18:44,504 --> 00:18:46,409
They phone Phnom Penh about me.

197
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:56,812
I want some cigarettes.

198
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,304
And I need to take a leak.

199
00:19:03,347 --> 00:19:05,256
Would you tell them I need to piss?

200
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:29,865
He said, "No piss."

201
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:32,718
What does that mean?

202
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:35,024
That's no piss.

203
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:41,487
I've had enough of this bullshit.

204
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,041
I got a story to get to New York!

205
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:50,316
Don't leave me!

206
00:20:00,753 --> 00:20:01,967
I won't leave you.

207
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:10,284
They brought in the whole press corps!

208
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,678
They want to sanitize the story!
Bastards!

209
00:21:23,695 --> 00:21:25,736
I am going to tell you something.

210
00:21:25,969 --> 00:21:27,560
I'm walking out of here.

211
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:29,993
What are you gonna do?
Blow my head off?

212
00:21:30,252 --> 00:21:33,124
You got a general out there,
this is an American passport...

213
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,180
...and I am walking out of here!

214
00:21:37,837 --> 00:21:40,969
- He wants to get higher officer.
- Then get him! Get him!

215
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,996
I'm sorry we couldn't show you the
minor bomb damage in the city itself.

216
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:54,920
It's still a restricted area.

217
00:21:55,118 --> 00:21:57,289
Now, if you look across the river...

218
00:21:57,485 --> 00:22:00,298
...you'll see positions held by
Khmer Rouge...

219
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:02,218
...who moved in over
the past few days.

220
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:05,511
But the Cambodian Republican Army
is moving in on them.

221
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,060
They'll have the K.R. Out
before you can say "Jack Robinson."

222
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:11,560
Get in the chopper now!

223
00:22:11,855 --> 00:22:15,170
No, Schanberg! You came on a boat,
you go back on a boat!

224
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:17,477
That won't stop my story!

225
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:21,002
What is this?

226
00:22:21,196 --> 00:22:24,098
If you weren't down here,
I wouldn't be down here.

227
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,083
And I don't want to be down here!
What good is it doing?

228
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:29,033
If anybody ever reads about this...

229
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:31,815
...you won't be able to look them
in the face!

230
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:11,491
Good morning.

231
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:13,249
What time is it?

232
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,607
Six o'clock.

233
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:18,855
Shit.

234
00:23:19,052 --> 00:23:20,228
Telex for you.

235
00:23:20,844 --> 00:23:22,251
You been to the telex?

236
00:23:24,554 --> 00:23:25,863
We made the front page.

237
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:26,986
Sure.

238
00:23:29,002 --> 00:23:30,978
We must be doing something right.

239
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:41,120
My wife is very worried.

240
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,185
She thinks all foreign journalists
are going to leave Cambodia.

241
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,006
Well, Pran...

242
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:53,385
...l'd feel kind of stupid trying to
cover this war from a desk in Bangkok.

243
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:57,726
And she said if the war
keeps going like this...

244
00:23:57,926 --> 00:23:59,999
...the future could be very bad.

245
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,043
What do you think?

246
00:24:05,993 --> 00:24:07,269
I don't know.

247
00:24:09,672 --> 00:24:10,982
I don't know either.

248
00:24:13,642 --> 00:24:15,529
- Is Sarun downstairs?
- Sure.

249
00:24:16,714 --> 00:24:18,057
Let's get going.

250
00:24:18,987 --> 00:24:19,915
All right.

251
00:24:25,928 --> 00:24:27,170
Don't go back to sleep.

252
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:28,413
I won't.

253
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:39,171
K.R.'s making a push
for the airport road.

254
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:41,311
If they cut it,
the city could be lost.

255
00:24:41,512 --> 00:24:44,809
We hype these people up. "You'll be
all right with us," we say.

256
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:47,169
Now look at all this fucking mess!

257
00:24:54,088 --> 00:24:57,185
In America, everybody got a good car.

258
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:01,605
He ask you what car you drive
in United States.

259
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,733
I don't have a car in America,
only the Mercedes here.

260
00:25:04,935 --> 00:25:07,039
Mercedes, number one!

261
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,980
Ask him where he learned
to speak his English.

262
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:15,203
American advisor with his unit
teach him.

263
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:17,372
Mercedes, number one, okay?

264
00:25:54,087 --> 00:25:55,099
What did he say?

265
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,203
He said he thought all
American people left already.

266
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,676
Made in the USA.

267
00:26:04,035 --> 00:26:05,016
Are we winning?

268
00:26:05,892 --> 00:26:07,898
No, you're not winning.

269
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,376
What should we do?

270
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:12,669
Well, you make sure they don't
cut off the airport road.

271
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:17,759
The first section came
by Route number 36.

272
00:26:18,404 --> 00:26:21,948
And the second one
came down by Route number 26.

273
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:24,538
Khmer Rouge will come down Route 3.

274
00:26:24,964 --> 00:26:26,339
He doesn't know how many.

275
00:26:26,531 --> 00:26:28,440
They expect an attack today.

276
00:26:28,642 --> 00:26:30,071
- Where's your commander?
- Phnom Penh.

277
00:26:30,274 --> 00:26:31,617
- Why there?
- Don't know.

278
00:26:31,811 --> 00:26:33,666
How many mortar rounds you have...?

279
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:50,940
Rockoff, get your ass out here!
Get out here!

280
00:26:53,473 --> 00:26:55,644
Come on, let's get him out of here!

281
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:23,485
- Fuck this!
- They pulling out?

282
00:27:23,681 --> 00:27:25,535
I'm not happy here, Syd.

283
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,552
Jon, I'm leaving.

284
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:29,305
Syd, come on!

285
00:27:29,632 --> 00:27:30,581
Come on!

286
00:27:43,615 --> 00:27:45,023
Sydney, this way!

287
00:28:05,471 --> 00:28:07,193
Sydney, look! Khmer Rouge!

288
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,561
In Washington, the
Cambodian ambassador...

289
00:28:57,754 --> 00:29:00,537
...in a speech to
the Washington Press Club said:

290
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:03,516
"Let's face it, you took
advantage of us."

291
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:04,569
I can't eat.

292
00:29:04,764 --> 00:29:09,401
"You are cleverer than we are, and
you induced us into this fighting."

293
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:13,045
Indeed, the Khmer Rouge
insurgents in Cambodia...

294
00:29:13,246 --> 00:29:16,279
...have tightened their ring
around the capital, Phnom Penh...

295
00:29:16,478 --> 00:29:19,928
...now swollen with some two million
refugees from the fighting.

296
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:24,184
Reports from government troops talk
of the field situation being so bad...

297
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:27,576
...that soldiers are having
to siphon gas from jeep to jeep...

298
00:29:27,774 --> 00:29:31,571
...in order to be able to get
the wounded back to the capital.

299
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,693
No more electricity.

300
00:30:24,604 --> 00:30:27,122
And now I get a message
to try for negotiations.

301
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:29,210
Well, it's just too goddamn late!

302
00:30:29,401 --> 00:30:31,640
Alan, this country's split apart.

303
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:35,479
We put this ship to sea, and it breaks
my heart not to help it back to port.

304
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:36,723
Any port.

305
00:30:37,846 --> 00:30:41,494
What pisses me off is, this country
has faults and strengths...

306
00:30:41,688 --> 00:30:45,103
...and we have done nothing
but play to the faults.

307
00:30:47,703 --> 00:30:50,575
I tell you, I will be damn
glad to get out of here.

308
00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:55,316
This thing has dragged on too long for
it to end in all sweetness and light.

309
00:30:55,513 --> 00:30:57,686
After what the Khmer Rouge
have been through...

310
00:30:57,883 --> 00:31:00,728
...they won't be exactly
affectionate toward Westerners.

311
00:31:02,774 --> 00:31:05,590
- Where do you want this?
- On the floor. Anywhere.

312
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:09,232
- Mr. Schanberg...
- Oh, Christ, my dependents! Six.

313
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:10,643
Dith Pran and family.

314
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,823
Right.

315
00:31:13,112 --> 00:31:17,750
"Dear sir, my family and I are planning
a touring vacation of Southeast Asia...

316
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:22,483
...and anticipate two weeks
in Cambodia touring the country.

317
00:31:23,096 --> 00:31:26,293
Would you please send tour
information and brochures?

318
00:31:26,489 --> 00:31:28,690
Thanking you in advance,
Wendell Payne."

319
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:31,666
Wendell lives in Wisacky,
South Carolina.

320
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:33,903
What about the airlift?

321
00:31:34,103 --> 00:31:35,598
We're taking it with us.

322
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:39,637
- People will starve to death.
- I know, but what can we do?

323
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,101
Look, there could be a bloodbath here.

324
00:31:43,352 --> 00:31:46,963
Excuse the pun, but we're
either staying or we're living.

325
00:31:57,974 --> 00:32:01,292
Hello, leaving a sinking ship then,
are we, Carver?

326
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:10,357
President Ford, in his foreign policy
speech, hardly referred to Cambodia...

327
00:32:10,551 --> 00:32:14,325
...except to say that, as of now,
it may be too late.

328
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:30,604
I'm sorry. I'm late.

329
00:32:30,806 --> 00:32:32,014
Where you been?

330
00:32:32,342 --> 00:32:34,958
- They stop me because of the curfew.
- The curfew, huh?

331
00:32:35,158 --> 00:32:36,717
Yes. I'm sorry.

332
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:42,471
Get started on this.
Tell them to start sending this out...

333
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:46,223
...but hold the last two paragraphs.
I'll have corrections in an hour.

334
00:32:47,411 --> 00:32:51,244
They don't transmit today.
The transmitter at Kambol got hit.

335
00:32:52,852 --> 00:32:55,119
They say 6 p.m. We can file.

336
00:32:55,315 --> 00:32:56,689
6 p.m.

337
00:32:58,261 --> 00:33:01,491
What do you think this is?
A monthly magazine?

338
00:33:01,684 --> 00:33:03,594
This is a newspaper.

339
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:08,109
How about update tomorrow?

340
00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:13,521
Yeah, sure. We can file
an update tomorrow.

341
00:33:22,612 --> 00:33:24,914
I was over at the
American Embassy yesterday.

342
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,930
Good news?

343
00:33:27,126 --> 00:33:28,849
No, not good news.

344
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:37,229
They say that when
this place goes up...

345
00:33:40,498 --> 00:33:43,948
...they think a lot of people
will be killed. A lot of people.

346
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:48,652
I've arranged for the evacuation
of you and your family.

347
00:33:51,381 --> 00:33:53,714
So now it's up to you.
What do you want to do?

348
00:33:56,116 --> 00:33:58,054
Do you want to stay
or leave?

349
00:34:06,418 --> 00:34:07,397
And how about you?

350
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:10,351
That's none of your business.

351
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:18,671
Do you want to stay,
or do you want to leave?

352
00:34:22,098 --> 00:34:23,241
I know.

353
00:34:23,983 --> 00:34:25,544
You love my family.

354
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:32,430
But me, I'm reporter too.

355
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,535
You know what I mean?

356
00:34:49,102 --> 00:34:52,614
All right, we don't have
to decide this right now.

357
00:34:52,815 --> 00:34:54,123
Take it easy.

358
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:01,926
But we'll have to make up our
minds pretty soon, right?

359
00:36:11,852 --> 00:36:14,439
All right, this is it!
Is the floor clear?

360
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:17,286
This is the last check.

361
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,499
Last check. This is the last check!

362
00:36:28,841 --> 00:36:30,271
Mr. Kincaid is not here.

363
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:33,506
Mr. Kincaid is gone.
You keep Mr. Kincaid's money.

364
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,654
Now, I want you to go right now!

365
00:36:36,076 --> 00:36:37,601
I want you to leave now!

366
00:36:37,802 --> 00:36:39,811
You won't see Mr. Kincaid again!

367
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:54,819
Okay, sergeant, let him in!

368
00:36:57,866 --> 00:37:01,032
Have you got Pran here?
Have you got Pran on there?

369
00:37:01,227 --> 00:37:03,748
- And his wife?
- Yes, sir, they are.

370
00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:07,046
- Did they come in yet?
- No, sir, they haven't arrived yet.

371
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,380
Have you seen Pran?

372
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:22,526
No, I haven't.

373
00:37:23,273 --> 00:37:24,255
Where is he?

374
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:29,828
Well, it's been real.

375
00:37:35,113 --> 00:37:36,543
They're gonna miss it.

376
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:39,712
Why don't you check around
the other side?

377
00:37:40,361 --> 00:37:43,262
If he comes here, I'm looking
for him in the back.

378
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:57,221
Beth! Have you seen Pran?

379
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:59,522
No, have you looked at the hotel?

380
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:01,508
He's at the post office!

381
00:38:01,897 --> 00:38:03,423
The post office!

382
00:38:30,921 --> 00:38:33,089
Get the fuck out!
Get out of here now!

383
00:38:33,351 --> 00:38:35,454
Move your asses out of here!

384
00:38:35,911 --> 00:38:37,317
Hold those doors!

385
00:38:41,128 --> 00:38:43,942
- Where do you think you're going?
- To embassy.

386
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:00,603
Yes, sir, what's your name?

387
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,115
Dith Pran family, sir.

388
00:39:02,308 --> 00:39:03,999
Dith Pran family?

389
00:39:04,197 --> 00:39:06,434
- Sydney Schanberg.
- They've been through.

390
00:39:06,884 --> 00:39:09,274
- They've been through.
- Check one more time, please.

391
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:11,649
- You made a mistake, sir.
- No mistake.

392
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,158
Rockoff, help me!

393
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,859
Run!

394
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:30,741
There's no time!

395
00:42:36,511 --> 00:42:37,438
Wait a minute.

396
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:41,972
Smile.

397
00:43:07,801 --> 00:43:08,817
Jon.

398
00:43:09,371 --> 00:43:10,418
Hello, Sydney.

399
00:43:27,132 --> 00:43:30,875
If the going gets rough, I heard
our best bet's the French Embassy.

400
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:34,775
Who told you that?

401
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:39,285
The British Embassy.

402
00:44:08,537 --> 00:44:10,130
Khmer Rouge coming.

403
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:13,366
Look like government soldiers
give them big welcome.

404
00:45:15,062 --> 00:45:16,404
No more fighting!

405
00:45:16,759 --> 00:45:18,035
I be right back!

406
00:45:33,527 --> 00:45:35,284
No more fighting! No more war!

407
00:45:35,703 --> 00:45:36,979
What do you think?

408
00:45:38,038 --> 00:45:39,695
I don't like the look of this.

409
00:45:39,894 --> 00:45:44,401
I was in Keng Kang this morning.
Practically got my ass shot off.

410
00:45:44,597 --> 00:45:47,412
I just don't think these guys
are for real.

411
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:50,737
I'm going to the hospital.
You want to come with me?

412
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,682
Tetracaine, 50 milligrams, please.

413
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,101
Jesus, what am I supposed to do?
Sing her a lullaby?

414
00:47:01,301 --> 00:47:03,570
Pentothal, 150 milligrams, quick.

415
00:47:14,452 --> 00:47:17,613
Jesus, another shrapnel
in the spine here.

416
00:47:17,808 --> 00:47:19,435
Okay, let's have her over.

417
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:29,417
This is blood group A. We've had one
unit of blood in the last two days.

418
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:32,232
Plasma substitute, please, quick.

419
00:47:33,107 --> 00:47:35,595
We've plenty of blood, gentlemen.
Plenty of blood.

420
00:47:35,794 --> 00:47:38,282
The problem is, it's all in
the wrong fucking place.

421
00:47:41,011 --> 00:47:45,003
Why do corpses have to pile up before
people decide it's time to go home?

422
00:48:11,696 --> 00:48:14,118
For God's sake, back up the car!
Sarun, back it up!

423
00:48:14,321 --> 00:48:16,654
For God's sake, back it up now!

424
00:49:29,293 --> 00:49:32,676
- Why doesn't he get his ass in here?
- He's trying to get in!

425
00:49:33,165 --> 00:49:34,408
They won't let him in.

426
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:58,116
All right?

427
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:02,362
Okay?

428
00:56:02,556 --> 00:56:03,703
Looks all right.

429
00:58:56,728 --> 00:58:57,741
I'm coming!

430
00:59:05,335 --> 00:59:07,277
Just a minute! He's with me!

431
00:59:07,543 --> 00:59:09,299
He's with The New York Times!

432
00:59:09,495 --> 00:59:12,561
Wait just a minute!
He's a journalist and he's with me!

433
00:59:13,113 --> 00:59:16,373
Where is the consul? I want to talk
to the consul. Let me see him!

434
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:19,184
You tell me where he is.
I want to speak to him!

435
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,795
The picture in Cambodia
is increasingly unclear.

436
00:59:23,991 --> 00:59:27,253
Journalists who have flown
from Thailand over Phnom Penh...

437
00:59:27,445 --> 00:59:29,998
...report that the Khmer Rouge
have attempted...

438
00:59:30,197 --> 00:59:33,198
...a mass evacuation
of the entire population.

439
00:59:33,398 --> 00:59:37,773
Radio contact with the French Embassy
reveals that some 200 Europeans...

440
00:59:37,973 --> 00:59:42,099
...and an undisclosed number
of Cambodians have taken refuge.

441
00:59:42,293 --> 00:59:46,257
As yet, no statement has been made
by the new rulers of Cambodia.

442
00:59:46,456 --> 00:59:50,828
The whereabouts of Prince Sihanouk
and the Khmer Rouge leadership...

443
00:59:51,028 --> 00:59:52,434
...are not clear.

444
00:59:58,101 --> 01:00:00,433
- Okay?
- Yes. He's sleeping.

445
01:00:25,171 --> 01:00:26,000
That's the consul.

446
01:00:34,901 --> 01:00:37,713
- Did you see that, Dennis?
- The Russians are coming.

447
01:00:43,698 --> 01:00:45,390
Look, piss off! Please!

448
01:00:45,587 --> 01:00:48,588
Get out! You won't get
anything here! Out!

449
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:57,931
First, the main points of the news.

450
01:00:58,131 --> 01:00:59,592
BBC, Dougal.

451
01:01:02,226 --> 01:01:04,943
- Daily reports of fighting
around the airport...

452
01:01:05,137 --> 01:01:08,815
...14 kilometers outside Phnom Penh,
the capital of Cambodia.

453
01:01:09,714 --> 01:01:13,488
And now, an on-the-spot report
from our correspondent in Thailand...

454
01:01:13,683 --> 01:01:14,697
...Hugh Elder.

455
01:01:16,561 --> 01:01:18,603
Where do they get this crap?

456
01:01:19,122 --> 01:01:22,122
Do you see that guy across the gate?
The little guy?

457
01:01:23,187 --> 01:01:25,607
Could we not all look at once, please?

458
01:01:26,355 --> 01:01:29,799
I have it on reliable sources
that that's Hugh Elder.

459
01:01:30,512 --> 01:01:31,309
You're kidding.

460
01:01:31,504 --> 01:01:34,821
He's disguised, but I got suspicious
about him. You know what I mean?

461
01:01:35,023 --> 01:01:37,871
- How does he get copy out?
- How does he get his copy out?

462
01:01:38,066 --> 01:01:39,723
With specially trained hens.

463
01:01:40,977 --> 01:01:45,004
The BBC has, like, commissioned
them to walk past the Khmer Rouge...

464
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,892
...like their regular fowl.

465
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:51,433
They've been crossing the border into
Thailand every day and every night.

466
01:01:52,464 --> 01:01:53,479
I told you.

467
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,451
Unconfirmed reports say
the Khmer Rouge are demanding...

468
01:01:57,647 --> 01:02:01,128
...that any officials of
the defeated Lon Nol government...

469
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:04,296
...especially the so-called
Six Traitors of the Cabinet...

470
01:02:04,497 --> 01:02:06,057
...be handed over to them.

471
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:08,875
It is not known whether
any of the ex-ministers...

472
01:02:09,071 --> 01:02:11,079
...may have taken refuge
in the embassy...

473
01:02:11,282 --> 01:02:14,576
...where, in the words of a UNICEF
representative in Bangkok...

474
01:02:14,769 --> 01:02:18,543
...the situation is said to be
"increasingly precarious."

475
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:47,831
And when I tried to go
just a kilometer further, no.

476
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:50,550
The only sense I can make of it
is that there's...

477
01:03:50,751 --> 01:03:53,567
...some sort of internal
power struggle going on.

478
01:03:54,112 --> 01:03:57,369
Different groups seem to be
holding different parts of the city...

479
01:03:58,047 --> 01:04:02,651
...and they all appear to be equally
nervous over losing power and control.

480
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:05,139
Half of them are under 15.

481
01:04:05,822 --> 01:04:08,638
Some Red Cross instruction
sheets want translating.

482
01:04:08,832 --> 01:04:09,781
Can you help?

483
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,447
Use Pran. He speaks French
better than I do.

484
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,615
I'd prefer it if it was you.

485
01:04:25,471 --> 01:04:26,901
What did you do that for?

486
01:04:27,328 --> 01:04:29,400
The guy's insecure enough already.

487
01:04:31,584 --> 01:04:34,007
The Cambodians have
to leave the embassy.

488
01:04:36,608 --> 01:04:40,022
They want all our passports
and everybody downstairs...

489
01:04:40,513 --> 01:04:42,487
...and the Cambodians out.

490
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:20,672
If you have papers,
you have a name.

491
01:05:20,868 --> 01:05:22,974
If we have a name,
we can find the mother.

492
01:05:23,717 --> 01:05:26,237
Look, I fight for five years.

493
01:05:26,853 --> 01:05:28,162
Useless war.

494
01:05:31,416 --> 01:05:32,166
Fuck!

495
01:05:34,765 --> 01:05:37,417
You know, Pran is not gonna last
five minutes out there.

496
01:05:37,612 --> 01:05:41,222
The Khmer Rouge have killed every
journalist they've ever caught.

497
01:05:41,579 --> 01:05:43,203
Does Syd know how serious this is?

498
01:05:43,402 --> 01:05:46,919
- Of course he bloody knows!
- We can't let him walk out of here.

499
01:05:47,661 --> 01:05:51,557
Look, two passports. This one's
out-of-date, but the visa's valid.

500
01:05:51,757 --> 01:05:53,864
Jon Ankertill Brewer Swain.

501
01:05:54,062 --> 01:05:58,088
Knock out the Jon, knock out the Swain,
and you're left with Ankertill Brewer.

502
01:05:58,734 --> 01:06:02,031
Change my photograph for one of Pran,
and he's a British subject.

503
01:06:02,222 --> 01:06:03,399
It's worth a try.

504
01:06:03,692 --> 01:06:07,337
I hope he's got a photo because
I don't have any fucking film.

505
01:06:21,263 --> 01:06:23,500
I try to escape to Thailand right now.

506
01:06:23,695 --> 01:06:25,388
Give me two or three weeks.

507
01:06:26,801 --> 01:06:28,773
If you get there first, let me know.

508
01:06:29,325 --> 01:06:31,945
And leave message for me
at Reuters. Okay?

509
01:06:32,749 --> 01:06:36,329
Just give me an hour.
I need some time to think.

510
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:39,108
I got no time to give you.

511
01:06:40,654 --> 01:06:42,347
Swain's got an idea.

512
01:06:48,241 --> 01:06:50,412
Ankertill Brewer.
That's the new name.

513
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:53,028
- Ankertill Brewer.
- Right. Now, my photograph.

514
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:56,134
- Change my photograph for yours.
- Do you have an old photo?

515
01:06:56,336 --> 01:06:57,284
I don't think so.

516
01:06:58,127 --> 01:06:59,721
Give him your passport.

517
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,992
Your old passport,
a family snapshot, anything.

518
01:07:02,192 --> 01:07:03,208
Khmer Rouge took everything.

519
01:07:03,408 --> 01:07:05,351
- What about your press card?
- Everything!

520
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:06,381
Fuck!

521
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:09,450
- Didn't give it back.
- We'll go and find some film.

522
01:07:09,648 --> 01:07:13,512
There's film here. We'll get it.
Polaroid, any kind, any speed.

523
01:07:14,546 --> 01:07:17,131
We're gonna get it,
and I'll shoot it, okay?

524
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:18,757
We'll find the film.

525
01:07:20,848 --> 01:07:23,085
Do you have a Polaroid camera?
Do you have film?

526
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,775
No, I haven't got any film!

527
01:07:24,979 --> 01:07:29,420
I've also got no metronidazole, and
this child has got amebic dysentery!

528
01:07:32,019 --> 01:07:34,191
We've gotta get sulfide
and a developer.

529
01:07:34,387 --> 01:07:36,493
If we can get that,
I can make the photo.

530
01:07:36,818 --> 01:07:37,747
Shit!

531
01:07:38,229 --> 01:07:41,874
Listen, I know where we can get
some water. We can drain...

532
01:07:42,069 --> 01:07:45,263
...the air conditioning vent.
I've seen it done. Come on.

533
01:07:50,131 --> 01:07:52,848
Excuse me, you're Mr. Schanberg?

534
01:07:53,717 --> 01:07:57,099
I've been told that you're
in charge of bed covers.

535
01:07:57,299 --> 01:07:58,160
What?

536
01:07:59,445 --> 01:08:03,122
Blankets. We've just arrived.
We want some blankets.

537
01:08:04,469 --> 01:08:06,062
Come on down here.

538
01:08:06,678 --> 01:08:08,499
Go to the end of the hall there.

539
01:08:09,778 --> 01:08:11,688
Turn to the right,
go up the stairs.

540
01:08:11,891 --> 01:08:15,088
If there are any, they'll be
at the top of the stairs.

541
01:08:15,284 --> 01:08:18,416
Syd, I have got the camera...

542
01:08:19,093 --> 01:08:20,620
...I have got the film...

543
01:08:21,076 --> 01:08:23,948
...and I have got
the fucking darkroom!

544
01:08:28,468 --> 01:08:30,608
All right. Don't smile.

545
01:08:33,652 --> 01:08:36,043
- You're smiling.
- Very serious. You are smiling.

546
01:08:36,469 --> 01:08:37,778
Stop, please.

547
01:08:37,973 --> 01:08:40,843
- Very serious.
- Very serious, very American.

548
01:08:55,189 --> 01:08:56,269
Okay, cover it.

549
01:09:01,781 --> 01:09:03,918
This fucking paper, I don't know.

550
01:09:04,626 --> 01:09:07,115
That was the stuff you found
in the coatroom.

551
01:09:09,173 --> 01:09:10,830
Ankertill Brewer.

552
01:09:11,669 --> 01:09:14,004
Ankertill Brewer.

553
01:09:28,981 --> 01:09:31,217
Getting an image.
Look at it.

554
01:09:31,413 --> 01:09:32,907
Look, the bugger's face.

555
01:09:33,112 --> 01:09:35,282
It sure is. Come on.

556
01:09:36,181 --> 01:09:37,391
Come on.

557
01:09:38,356 --> 01:09:39,406
Come on.

558
01:09:40,917 --> 01:09:42,381
Now fix it.

559
01:09:44,024 --> 01:09:45,396
That's good.

560
01:09:48,627 --> 01:09:50,767
Oh, no. Fuck, it's fogging.

561
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:52,338
Goddamn it.

562
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:55,281
Goddamn this paper!

563
01:09:55,478 --> 01:09:58,612
Goddamn it!
We're gonna have to start again.

564
01:10:07,674 --> 01:10:09,201
Okay, now we gotta fix it.

565
01:10:11,259 --> 01:10:12,273
I did it.

566
01:10:14,422 --> 01:10:15,797
Let me have that.

567
01:10:18,263 --> 01:10:19,376
It's fading.

568
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,207
Take it out.

569
01:10:21,399 --> 01:10:25,047
No, it's already gone. The solution's
too strong. It's fading.

570
01:10:25,242 --> 01:10:26,932
Take it out now.
I mean, if it's...

571
01:10:27,129 --> 01:10:28,143
Fuck!

572
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:30,615
Goddamn it!

573
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:37,718
Man, this fucking room is killing me.

574
01:10:37,973 --> 01:10:39,254
Could I just...?

575
01:10:39,672 --> 01:10:41,428
I'll just do it myself, okay?

576
01:10:41,626 --> 01:10:44,822
Let me just have a few feet
in here by myself.

577
01:10:45,721 --> 01:10:46,705
Fuck.

578
01:10:48,025 --> 01:10:48,921
Sorry.

579
01:11:02,969 --> 01:11:04,148
That's it.

580
01:11:20,188 --> 01:11:21,531
It's perfect.

581
01:11:22,813 --> 01:11:23,893
Perfect.

582
01:11:38,074 --> 01:11:40,278
Welcome to New York. We got it.

583
01:11:40,476 --> 01:11:42,550
Perfect. Rockoff, perfect!

584
01:11:42,748 --> 01:11:45,334
Ankertill Brewer. Ankertill Brewer.

585
01:11:45,565 --> 01:11:49,046
All right, you jokers, would you like
to bring your passports over to me?

586
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,612
This is the last call for passports.

587
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:53,943
Can I have your passports, please?

588
01:11:54,683 --> 01:11:56,574
Can I have your passports, please?

589
01:11:57,917 --> 01:11:58,866
Thank you.

590
01:11:59,165 --> 01:12:01,142
Passports, ladies and gents.

591
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:06,293
All right, you jokers, this is your
last chance to get your passports in.

592
01:12:09,374 --> 01:12:10,620
Your passports, please.

593
01:12:10,816 --> 01:12:12,888
On this passport depend my life.

594
01:12:14,495 --> 01:12:15,293
Thank you.

595
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:19,641
Passports, ladies. This is for
the big tour, the big package.

596
01:12:22,142 --> 01:12:25,458
From Thursday Island right down
to Mount Macedon...

597
01:12:25,662 --> 01:12:28,120
...to see the famous Hanging Rock.

598
01:12:28,318 --> 01:12:29,846
Come on, passports, please.

599
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:33,175
Ladies and gentlemen, last call.

600
01:12:33,376 --> 01:12:34,520
Going...

601
01:12:35,007 --> 01:12:35,804
...going...

602
01:12:40,256 --> 01:12:41,239
...gone.

603
01:13:11,744 --> 01:13:12,891
Is this lunch?

604
01:13:18,275 --> 01:13:19,103
What?

605
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:24,154
It seems certain
that the majority...

606
01:13:24,356 --> 01:13:28,894
...of Phnom Penh's population has
been evacuated to the countryside.

607
01:13:29,092 --> 01:13:32,322
The population is swollen
with thousands of refugees.

608
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:33,625
Hello again.

609
01:13:38,274 --> 01:13:42,651
It'll be argued by some that this is
a way of coping with postwar chaos.

610
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:45,409
Dennis, can you turn
that down, please?

611
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:49,372
Now, listen, everybody.

612
01:13:51,237 --> 01:13:55,459
The trucks which we've seen arriving
are for our evacuation.

613
01:13:55,749 --> 01:13:58,497
Probably in the next 24 hours.

614
01:13:59,172 --> 01:14:01,562
Now, listen. That's to be confirmed.

615
01:14:02,019 --> 01:14:03,962
It's almost certainly for Thailand.

616
01:14:14,118 --> 01:14:16,061
These so-called journalists
have no right...

617
01:14:16,261 --> 01:14:20,257
You're not biased? You haven't
seen any atrocities in Cambodia?

618
01:14:20,454 --> 01:14:23,967
- It's just an emotional spasm!
- Yes, it is, yes. So just shut up!

619
01:14:24,164 --> 01:14:26,433
You have to break eggs
to make an omelet!

620
01:15:18,216 --> 01:15:20,551
Sydney, Ankertill Brewer.

621
01:17:25,806 --> 01:17:28,710
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Good luck.

622
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,811
- Give me these back in Paris.
- Goodbye.

623
01:17:33,007 --> 01:17:34,568
Don't forget. All right?

624
01:17:34,769 --> 01:17:37,550
Why didn't you get him out
when you had the chance?

625
01:17:37,744 --> 01:17:39,435
You had no right to keep him here!

626
01:17:39,633 --> 01:17:41,674
You've got a funny
sense of priorities.

627
01:17:41,873 --> 01:17:44,719
I'm a reporter too, Morgan.
I know his heart.

628
01:17:44,944 --> 01:17:46,918
- I love him like my brother.
- Sure.

629
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:49,990
And I do anything for him.
Anything.

630
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,749
Goodbye, Rockoff.

631
01:18:18,257 --> 01:18:20,714
Tell my wife I love her...

632
01:18:20,913 --> 01:18:23,150
...and look after all my children.

633
01:18:24,405 --> 01:18:27,699
She doesn't speak any English.

634
01:18:29,525 --> 01:18:30,866
Please...

635
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:34,952
...I don't want anyone
to be bad to my wife.

636
01:19:09,621 --> 01:19:10,963
Dith Pran.

637
01:19:11,828 --> 01:19:14,928
P-R-A-N.
He disappeared in Phnom Penh in 1975.

638
01:19:15,126 --> 01:19:18,191
Pran is his first name.
Any information you can give.

639
01:19:19,096 --> 01:19:21,965
Well, we're hoping
for any information at all.

640
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:25,778
He was last seen in '75.
Can you get me that number again?

641
01:19:25,973 --> 01:19:26,771
In April 1975.

642
01:19:26,965 --> 01:19:31,474
4144-5364...

643
01:20:02,136 --> 01:20:04,275
Pran is a resourceful man.

644
01:20:04,472 --> 01:20:06,994
He will wait until he knows
that it's safe...

645
01:20:07,193 --> 01:20:08,950
...and then he'll make his move.

646
01:20:24,697 --> 01:20:27,282
Thank you for coming...

647
01:20:27,545 --> 01:20:29,587
...and taking care of her
and her family.

648
01:20:29,785 --> 01:20:33,103
But she knows that
her husband is dead.

649
01:20:33,723 --> 01:20:35,031
That's not true.

650
01:20:36,668 --> 01:20:38,967
That's absolutely not true.

651
01:20:46,329 --> 01:20:48,370
It's not true. It's not.

652
01:20:49,596 --> 01:20:51,385
She doesn't believe you...

653
01:20:51,578 --> 01:20:54,513
...because she knows
her husband is dead.

654
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:17,845
You're a good man.

655
01:21:20,155 --> 01:21:23,954
If your mother needs anything,
make sure she gets in touch with me.

656
01:21:27,770 --> 01:21:29,048
You better go.

657
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:07,769
For the past 5 years...

658
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:11,289
...as indicated on this map
that you see here...

659
01:23:11,714 --> 01:23:15,970
...North Vietnam has occupied
military sanctuaries...

660
01:23:16,161 --> 01:23:20,057
...all along the Cambodian frontier
with South Vietnam.

661
01:23:20,611 --> 01:23:21,887
As the President spoke...

662
01:23:22,084 --> 01:23:25,466
...American troops were preparing
to move into Cambodia.

663
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:31,363
The decision to invade, like
the earlier secret decision to bomb...

664
01:23:31,558 --> 01:23:33,442
...was withheld from
the Cambodian people.

665
01:23:33,796 --> 01:23:36,894
We will yell at the top of our lungs.
We will move.

666
01:23:38,084 --> 01:23:42,141
It's the fear that makes a man
so scared, you know?

667
01:23:48,453 --> 01:23:51,299
There are no American
combat advisors in Cambodia.

668
01:23:51,494 --> 01:23:55,072
There will be no American
combat troops or advisors in Cambodia.

669
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:56,733
We will aid Cambodia.

670
01:23:56,933 --> 01:24:01,154
Cambodia is the Nixon doctrine
in its purest form.

671
01:28:51,924 --> 01:28:53,006
Sydney...

672
01:28:53,718 --> 01:28:57,494
...I think of you often
and often my family.

673
01:28:58,131 --> 01:29:01,327
They tell us that God is dead.

674
01:29:01,555 --> 01:29:04,654
And now the party they call
the Angka...

675
01:29:04,853 --> 01:29:07,471
...will provide everything for us.

676
01:29:08,084 --> 01:29:10,903
He says Angka has identified...

677
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:13,003
...and proclaims the existence...

678
01:29:13,208 --> 01:29:15,345
...of a bad new disease...

679
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:20,246
...a memory sickness diagnosed
as thinking too much about life...

680
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:23,285
...in prerevolutionary Cambodia.

681
01:29:24,149 --> 01:29:28,013
He says we are surrounded by enemies.

682
01:29:28,569 --> 01:29:30,902
The enemy is inside us.

683
01:29:31,383 --> 01:29:33,489
No one can be trusted.

684
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:44,781
We must be like the ox...

685
01:29:44,984 --> 01:29:48,528
...and have no thought
except for the Party.

686
01:29:48,726 --> 01:29:52,021
No love but for the Angka.

687
01:29:56,535 --> 01:29:57,997
People starve...

688
01:29:59,288 --> 01:30:01,295
...but we must not grow food.

689
01:30:04,121 --> 01:30:06,010
We must honor the comrade children...

690
01:30:06,203 --> 01:30:09,333
...whose minds are not corrupted
by the past.

691
01:30:36,825 --> 01:30:38,166
Is anybody of us...

692
01:30:38,364 --> 01:30:39,189
...a doctor...

693
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:40,851
...professor...

694
01:30:41,084 --> 01:30:42,457
...and student?

695
01:30:42,906 --> 01:30:44,630
Angka needs you.

696
01:30:45,435 --> 01:30:47,322
Angka has forgiven all the past.

697
01:31:01,628 --> 01:31:02,675
Sydney...

698
01:31:03,675 --> 01:31:07,952
...Angka says that those
who were guilty of soft living...

699
01:31:08,156 --> 01:31:10,710
...in the years
of the great struggle...

700
01:31:10,907 --> 01:31:14,836
...and did not care for the sufferings
of the peasant must confess...

701
01:31:15,868 --> 01:31:18,803
...because now is the year zero...

702
01:31:19,069 --> 01:31:21,622
...and everything is to start anew.

703
01:31:29,914 --> 01:31:31,987
I'm full of fear, Sydney.

704
01:31:32,413 --> 01:31:35,096
I must show no understanding.

705
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:37,653
Not of French or English.

706
01:31:38,111 --> 01:31:40,249
I must have no past, Sydney.

707
01:31:41,501 --> 01:31:43,544
This is the year zero...

708
01:31:44,094 --> 01:31:46,233
...and nothing has gone before.

709
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:01,595
The wind whispers of fear and hate.

710
01:32:01,983 --> 01:32:04,854
The war has killed love, Sydney.

711
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,825
And those who confess
to the Angka vanish.

712
01:32:09,151 --> 01:32:12,381
And no one dare ask where they go.

713
01:32:12,734 --> 01:32:16,861
Here, only the silent survive.

714
01:37:47,089 --> 01:37:49,578
Mercedes, number one!

715
01:43:09,314 --> 01:43:13,536
Anyone who knows my work will know
that half of this belongs to Dith Pran.

716
01:43:16,037 --> 01:43:19,866
Without Pran, I wouldn't have been able
to file half the stories I did.

717
01:43:22,052 --> 01:43:25,402
It's nice to congratulate ourselves
on occasions like this.

718
01:43:25,736 --> 01:43:27,775
But I can't stand here tonight...

719
01:43:27,975 --> 01:43:30,528
...without thinking
of those innocent people...

720
01:43:30,727 --> 01:43:35,164
...Pran dedicated himself to helping
me bring to the notice of the public.

721
01:43:37,828 --> 01:43:41,122
As they pondered their options
in the White House...

722
01:43:41,317 --> 01:43:45,473
...the men who decided to bomb
and then to invade Cambodia...

723
01:43:46,115 --> 01:43:48,449
...concerned themselves
with many things:

724
01:43:49,767 --> 01:43:53,659
Great power conflicts
and collapsing dominoes...

725
01:43:54,918 --> 01:43:57,666
...looking tough and dangerous
to the North Vietnamese...

726
01:43:57,955 --> 01:44:02,082
...relieving pressure on the American
troop withdrawal from the South.

727
01:44:03,014 --> 01:44:05,185
They had domestic concerns as well...

728
01:44:05,381 --> 01:44:09,987
...which helps explain why they kept
the bombing of Cambodia a secret.

729
01:44:10,792 --> 01:44:14,335
And they may be assumed not to have
ignored self-interest...

730
01:44:14,535 --> 01:44:16,062
...in their own careers.

731
01:44:16,807 --> 01:44:19,393
What they specifically were not
concerned with...

732
01:44:19,592 --> 01:44:22,014
...were the Cambodians themselves.

733
01:44:22,408 --> 01:44:24,161
Not the people...

734
01:44:24,614 --> 01:44:26,524
...not the society...

735
01:44:26,982 --> 01:44:28,544
...not the country.

736
01:44:29,769 --> 01:44:32,998
Except in the abstract
as instruments of policy.

737
01:44:36,776 --> 01:44:38,464
Dith Pran and I...

738
01:44:39,176 --> 01:44:41,085
...tried to record and bring home...

739
01:44:41,289 --> 01:44:44,903
...the concrete consequences
of these decisions to real people.

740
01:44:45,418 --> 01:44:47,141
To human beings...

741
01:44:48,389 --> 01:44:51,041
...the people left out
of the Administration's plans...

742
01:44:51,239 --> 01:44:52,997
...but who paid the price...

743
01:44:53,193 --> 01:44:55,298
...and took the beating for them.

744
01:45:00,553 --> 01:45:04,548
I'm very pleased to accept this
on behalf of Dith Pran and myself.

745
01:45:05,066 --> 01:45:06,628
I'm very honored...

746
01:45:07,274 --> 01:45:09,828
...and I know that Pran would be
very proud.

747
01:45:22,026 --> 01:45:25,605
Do you plan to continue
with that theme in the future?

748
01:45:28,172 --> 01:45:30,823
Congratulations, Ernie.
Do it again next year!

749
01:45:31,017 --> 01:45:32,360
I'm sorry.

750
01:45:35,310 --> 01:45:38,089
- That was great, really good.
- Better than last year.

751
01:45:38,953 --> 01:45:41,408
Abe, meet my sister.

752
01:45:41,610 --> 01:45:43,365
I'm very happy to meet you.

753
01:45:43,561 --> 01:45:45,929
That's my dad.
Would you hold this for me?

754
01:45:46,986 --> 01:45:47,916
One second.

755
01:45:48,107 --> 01:45:51,174
I hoped you could recommend
a good school for journalism.

756
01:45:51,372 --> 01:45:54,221
I told my daughter I'd be
seeing you today.

757
01:45:54,413 --> 01:45:57,165
Just one minute, okay?
I'll be right back.

758
01:46:05,931 --> 01:46:09,577
Could I have your autograph?
I'm a great admirer of yours.

759
01:46:12,077 --> 01:46:14,664
Congratulations on your award,
it was well-deserved.

760
01:46:14,862 --> 01:46:17,994
Very impressive.
I was hoping you'd burst into song.

761
01:46:19,406 --> 01:46:22,025
- What are you doing here?
- You know what bothers me?

762
01:46:22,223 --> 01:46:23,019
What?

763
01:46:23,407 --> 01:46:25,992
It bothers me that you let Pran
stay in Cambodia...

764
01:46:26,189 --> 01:46:29,188
...because you wanted to win,
and you knew you needed him...

765
01:46:29,389 --> 01:46:32,007
- I didn't have any idea what...
- The fuck you didn't!

766
01:46:33,836 --> 01:46:35,876
The fuck you didn't.

767
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:39,814
I did everything I could,
and I'm doing everything I can.

768
01:46:40,016 --> 01:46:42,253
Nice to see you.
I'm on my way to Florida.

769
01:46:42,448 --> 01:46:43,942
I'm doing everything I can.

770
01:46:44,142 --> 01:46:47,309
I'm sure. I didn't realize
you'd been out there to see him.

771
01:46:47,507 --> 01:46:50,637
Don't play games with me, Al.
Don't play stupid games.

772
01:46:50,831 --> 01:46:54,345
Nobody gets to go in there.
If I thought I could, I would.

773
01:46:55,183 --> 01:46:57,127
I've sent out hundreds of photographs.

774
01:46:57,328 --> 01:47:00,839
Every relief organization
on the Thai-Kampuchean border...

775
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:08,045
...has got his picture. If I saw
one glimmer of hope, I'd go today.

776
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,023
Life isn't a '40s movie.

777
01:47:10,224 --> 01:47:13,903
You can't just get on a plane and
make the whole world come out right!

778
01:47:15,443 --> 01:47:18,125
And I can't believe
I'm hearing this from you!

779
01:47:22,737 --> 01:47:23,977
Congrats.

780
01:47:25,967 --> 01:47:28,424
Do you keep in touch
with Dith Pran's family?

781
01:47:28,622 --> 01:47:30,731
Yes. They're living in San Francisco.

782
01:47:30,929 --> 01:47:33,678
How do you respond to accusations
that journalists...

783
01:47:33,874 --> 01:47:36,142
...underestimated the brutality
of the Khmer Rouge...

784
01:47:36,338 --> 01:47:39,919
...and so share responsibility for
what happened in Cambodia afterwards?

785
01:47:40,566 --> 01:47:42,320
We made a mistake.

786
01:47:42,866 --> 01:47:45,355
Maybe we underestimated
the kind of insanity...

787
01:47:45,553 --> 01:47:47,977
...that $ 7 billion worth
of bombing could produce.

788
01:47:48,177 --> 01:47:49,292
That is provocative...

789
01:47:49,490 --> 01:47:52,751
There have been a lot of refugee
stories in Reader's Digest...

790
01:47:52,947 --> 01:47:55,283
...about Cambodia.
Do you believe them?

791
01:47:55,473 --> 01:47:56,971
Don't you believe them?

792
01:47:57,171 --> 01:48:00,881
Maybe in this instance the
Reader's Digest happens to be correct.

793
01:48:01,076 --> 01:48:03,278
Do you apply the same disbelief
to stories...

794
01:48:03,476 --> 01:48:05,865
...that come out of Iran
or Palestine or Chile?

795
01:48:06,069 --> 01:48:08,335
Are refugees your next area
of interest?

796
01:48:08,530 --> 01:48:10,865
Will you be covering the boat people?

797
01:48:11,057 --> 01:48:12,137
No, I will not.

798
01:48:12,339 --> 01:48:13,964
Do you want a cup of tea?

799
01:48:14,899 --> 01:48:18,348
Are you looking around for some kind
of more salable suffering?

800
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:23,342
I must have sent 500 letters.

801
01:48:28,628 --> 01:48:32,208
I wrote the International Red Cross,
the World Health Organization.

802
01:48:32,406 --> 01:48:34,991
I know you did, Syd.
You told me.

803
01:48:35,477 --> 01:48:37,650
I don't know who I didn't write to.

804
01:48:43,862 --> 01:48:46,413
I never really gave him any choice.

805
01:48:51,639 --> 01:48:54,640
One time we tried to discuss leaving.

806
01:49:03,221 --> 01:49:06,540
I talked to him about it,
but we never really discussed it.

807
01:49:09,718 --> 01:49:12,884
I discussed it with Swain and Rockoff.

808
01:49:16,728 --> 01:49:19,150
But I never discussed it with him.

809
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:32,697
He stayed because
I wanted him to stay.

810
01:49:38,488 --> 01:49:40,277
And I stayed because...

811
01:53:10,723 --> 01:53:12,513
I'm trapped, Sydney.

812
01:53:12,710 --> 01:53:16,733
I know he suspects me,
and yet he treats me well.

813
01:53:17,347 --> 01:53:20,608
There are many different groups
over here, Sydney.

814
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:22,908
I must take much care.

815
01:53:23,429 --> 01:53:27,326
Now Angka says we have new enemies.

816
01:53:27,847 --> 01:53:32,549
They say we must regain
our old lands from the Vietnamese.

817
01:53:33,283 --> 01:53:37,027
And now they say we must fight them.

818
01:53:38,757 --> 01:53:42,784
I miss you, my wife, my children.

819
01:53:42,981 --> 01:53:46,296
And my heart hungers for news of you.

820
01:54:09,448 --> 01:54:10,910
New China Radio reports...

821
01:54:11,111 --> 01:54:14,277
...that fighting between Vietnam
and Democratic Kampuchea...

822
01:54:14,472 --> 01:54:16,741
...has broken out
on a number of fronts.

823
01:54:17,001 --> 01:54:19,619
This is in retaliation,
according to the Vietnamese...

824
01:54:19,818 --> 01:54:22,150
...for a number of attacks
on border villages...

825
01:54:25,734 --> 01:54:27,044
Taxi driver, huh?

826
01:54:44,170 --> 01:54:45,925
I think you speak English.

827
01:54:46,376 --> 01:54:47,618
Sit down.

828
01:54:53,577 --> 01:54:55,999
You know, I love this country.

829
01:54:57,737 --> 01:55:00,421
I sacrificed everything for it.

830
01:55:01,835 --> 01:55:05,185
My wife died for the revolution.

831
01:55:07,019 --> 01:55:11,525
But the leaders of Angka
no longer trust the people.

832
01:55:12,427 --> 01:55:15,843
Therefore, I can no longer trust them.

833
01:55:17,611 --> 01:55:19,585
And they don't trust me.

834
01:55:21,996 --> 01:55:22,825
I fear...

835
01:55:24,171 --> 01:55:26,408
...really fear for the future.

836
01:55:30,635 --> 01:55:33,986
I think you love my son.

837
01:55:36,975 --> 01:55:38,179
For his sake...

838
01:55:39,210 --> 01:55:40,551
...look after him.

839
01:55:45,005 --> 01:55:47,491
The fighting is close by, Sydney.

840
01:55:47,691 --> 01:55:50,058
If the Vietnamese get here...

841
01:55:50,252 --> 01:55:52,327
...Angka will destroy everything...

842
01:55:54,382 --> 01:55:55,877
...and the Vietnamese,
they will find only ashes.

843
01:58:57,462 --> 01:59:00,756
I must try to stop the killing.
Good luck.

844
02:07:57,237 --> 02:07:59,059
Yeah, I'll be right there, Brian.

845
02:08:01,876 --> 02:08:05,674
Ann, get me 415-555-6421.

846
02:08:05,877 --> 02:08:07,502
Abe, I've got some great news!

847
02:08:20,180 --> 02:08:23,116
Twenty minutes ago, I get
a phone call from Paris.

848
02:08:23,318 --> 02:08:26,101
I get Andreas Freund.
He talked to Henry.

849
02:08:26,296 --> 02:08:28,302
He told him how to get in touch
with me.

850
02:08:28,503 --> 02:08:31,253
Freund says, "I have got
some great news for you."

851
02:08:31,449 --> 02:08:33,965
- San Francisco's on the line.
- "It's about Pran!"

852
02:08:34,325 --> 02:08:35,951
Is your mother there?

853
02:08:38,455 --> 02:08:39,566
When?

854
02:08:41,879 --> 02:08:44,434
All right,
I want you to get this down.

855
02:08:45,240 --> 02:08:47,793
No, write it down. Write it down.

856
02:08:49,273 --> 02:08:51,311
I've got a message from your dad!

857
02:10:01,274 --> 02:10:02,421
How you been?

858
02:10:14,971 --> 02:10:15,953
Do you forgive me?

859
02:10:16,635 --> 02:10:19,124
Nothing to forgive, Sydney.
Nothing.
