2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,300
The world is full of complainers.

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,800
But the fact is:
nothing comes with a guarantee.

4
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,300
I don't care if you're the Pope,

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,400
President of the United States,
Man of the Year.

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,000
Something can all go wrong.

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,500
Go ahead and complain,

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,000
tell your problems to your neighbor,
ask for help,

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,300
and watch them fly.

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,300
In Russia they map it out so that
everyone pulls for everyone else.

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,100
That's the theory anyway.

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
But what I know about is Texas.

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,400
And down here,

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,500
you're on your own.

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,300
He gave me a pearl-handled 38
for our first anniversary.

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,600
Think I better leave
before I use it on him.

17
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,300
I don't understand
how you can use it on him.

18
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,600
I'm only an employee.
I ain't married to him.

19
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,300
It's just...

20
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,700
I don't know.

21
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,800
Sometimes I think
something's wrong with him.

22
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,000
Maybe he's sick?

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,900
Mentally?

24
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,200
Or is it maybe me, do you think?

25
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,600
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor.

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,900
I don't know what goes on.

27
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,000
And I don't wanna know.

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
But I like you.

29
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,700
I've always liked you.

30
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,900
What're you gonna do in Houston?

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,400
I'll figure something out.

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,100
How come you offered to drive me
in this mess?

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,000
I told you I like you.

34
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,200
I never knew that.

35
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,200
Well, now you do.

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
Hell!

37
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Stop the car, Ray!

38
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,600
You know that car?

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No.

40
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,700
What's the matter?

41
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,400
I don't know.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,900
I just think maybe
I'm making a mistake.

43
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,500
What was that back there?

44
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,300
Back where?

45
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,800
That sign.

46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,900
I don't know.

47
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,000
A motel.

48
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,300
Did you mean what you said?
Were you just being a gentleman?

49
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Abby, I like you.

50
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,600
But there's no point
starting anything now.

51
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,600
I ain't a marriage counselor.

52
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,100
What do you wanna do?

53
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
What do you wanna do?

54
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,900
Hello.
- Having a good time?

55
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,100
Who is this?
- I don't know. Who is this?

56
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,000
You still there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.

57
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,700
Who was it?

58
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,600
Your husband.

59
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,100
I know
where you can get those framed.

60
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,300
Why'd you take these?

61
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,200
What d'you mean?
Just doing my job.

62
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,200
I knew they were there.
Why'd you take 'em?

63
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,300
I don't know.
Call it a fringe benefit.

64
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How long were you watching them?

65
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,900
Most of the night.

66
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,200
They'd rest every few minutes
and get started again.

67
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,800
Quite something.

68
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,100
You know, in Greece

69
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,200
they'd cut the head off the messenger
that brought bad news.

70
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,400
Now that don't make much sense.

71
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,300
No.

72
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,900
It made them feel better.

73
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
First off,

74
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,400
Julian,

75
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,600
I don't know
what the story is in Greece,

76
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,500
but in this state

77
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,100
we got very definite laws about that.
Second,

78
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,200
I'm not a messenger,

79
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,600
I'm a private investigator.

80
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,200
And third, and most important,

81
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,800
it ain't such bad news.

82
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,300
I mean, you thought he was colored.

83
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,500
You're always assuming the worst.

84
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,200
Anything else?

85
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,200
Don't come around here anymore.

86
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,000
If I need you,
I'll know what rock to turn over.

87
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,600
That's good.

88
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,600
"What rock to turn over..."

89
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,300
Very good!

90
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,700
Give me a call
whenever you wanna cut off my head.

91
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,700
I can always crawl around
without it.

92
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,900
We'll be back
after a short intermission...

93
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
Hold it!

94
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,200
Where was I?

95
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,200
You were telling me
about the ring of fire. - Right.

96
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,500
You got all these volcanoes, right?

97
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,600
Now every time one goes pop,
you got the equivalent of...

98
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,700
...20, 30 megatons of TNT.
- Meurice!

99
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,300
I know, Marty. Pour 'em short.

100
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,900
Is Ray in yet? - No, it's his night off.
Where was he last night?

101
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,500
I don't wanna know where he was.

102
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Didn't he call?

103
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,800
This is

104
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,900
an old friend of mine, Debra.

105
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,900
Debra, this is Julian Marty.

106
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,500
Deuce in the corner needs help.
- Right.

107
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,900
How long you know Meurice?
- About ten years.

108
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,700
10 years?
What are you doing tonight?

109
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,900
Going out with Meurice.

110
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,900
Tell him you have a headache.

111
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,500
He'll pass.

112
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We don't seem
to be communicating...

113
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,000
Look, you wanna hustle me?

114
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,100
I don't wanna be hustled.
- Oh, you don't?

115
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
It's as simple as that.
- Oh, as simple as that.

116
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,100
I'm not here if they come, okay?
- Right.

117
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,200
Nice guy.
- Not really.

118
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,800
What's your last name?

119
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,800
Good old boy.

120
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,600
Let's get outta here.

121
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,100
You get what you wanted?
- Yeah. Let's get outta here.

122
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,300
Drive me to a motel?
- You can stay at my place.

123
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,400
I'll drop you there.
- Where you goin'?

124
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,100
See a guy.

125
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,300
Don't go to the bar.
I know him. It ain't a good idea.

126
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,700
I just gotta see a guy.

127
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,700
So what's the deal?

128
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,400
None if your colleagues could harness
this volcanic energy?

129
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,600
And I just sit back and watch
these shit kickers go broke.

130
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,800
Sorry about last night.
- No sweat. Wasn't too busy.

131
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,600
But you missed a good one.

132
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,100
A white guy walks in and asks
do we have a discount for alcoholics.

133
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,000
I tell him to get lost.

134
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,700
But Marty's sitting here
thinking that maybe ain't a bad idea.

135
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,000
Well?

136
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,800
What?

137
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,300
What, what?
- Am I fired?

138
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You wanna hit me or what?

139
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,600
I don't particularly
want to talk to you.

140
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,400
Well!

141
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,000
If you aren't gonna fire me,
I'll quit.

142
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Fine!

143
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,600
Suit yourself.

144
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,200
Having a good time?

145
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,300
I don't like this kind of talk.
- What'd you come here for?

146
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,700
You owe me for two weeks.

147
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,100
Nope.

148
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
She's

149
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,800
an expensive piece of ass.

150
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,900
Who else has she been sluicing?

151
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,700
I want money! You gotta talk? Fine.
- Are you a fucking marriage counselor?

152
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,600
What're you smiling at?

153
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,100
I'm funny? I'm an asshole?

154
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
No.

155
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,300
That's not what's funny.
What's funny is her.

156
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
And that I had you two followed.

157
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,500
If it's not you she's sleeping with,
it's someone else.

158
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,800
And what's really gonna be funny is

159
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,100
when she gives you
that innocent look and says,

160
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
"I don't know
what you're talking about, Ray.

161
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,200
I ain't done anything funny."

162
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,400
The funniest thing

163
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
for me right now

164
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,700
is that you think
she came back here for you.

165
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,400
That's what's fuckin' funny!

166
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,200
Come on this property again
I'll be forced to shoot you.

167
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,700
Fair notice.

168
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,000
I thought you were dead.
You goin' home?

169
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
No.

170
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,500
I'm stayin' right here in hell.

171
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,600
Kind of a bleak point of view,
isn't it?

172
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,700
I don't want the asshole
near my money.

173
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,100
And I don't want him in the bar.

174
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,900
You get a lot of assholes in here.

175
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
Hello.

176
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,000
Who was it?

177
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,600
What?

178
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,700
On the phone.

179
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,800
Was it for you?

180
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,700
I don't know. He didn't say anything.

181
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,800
How did you know it was a "he?"

182
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,600
You got a girl?

183
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,700
Am I screwing something up
by being here? - No.

184
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,800
Am I?

185
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,800
I can find a place tomorrow, and I'll
be outta your hair. - If you want to,

186
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,500
then do it.

187
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
You want the bed or the couch?

188
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
Well...

189
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,200
The couch'll be all right.

190
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,400
You can sleep on the bed.

191
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,100
I'm not putting you outta your bed.
- You wouldn't be putting me out.

192
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,900
I'll be all right here.

193
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,800
Opal?

194
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,600
Lover boy oughta lock his door.

195
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,900
Lot of nuts out there.

196
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,200
Let's do it outside, in nature.

197
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,100
I'd like to have seen his face
when he found the dead end.

198
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,000
Hey, mister!
How'd you break your pussy finger?

199
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,700
I want it! I want it!

200
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,500
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
My date's here.

201
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,400
She saw me rollin' a cigarette
and thought it was marijuana.

202
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Thought I was a swinger, I guess.

203
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,600
Isn't that wild?

204
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,300
Stick your finger
up the wrong person's ass?

205
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,700
A friend of mine broke his hand,
and it was put in a cast.

206
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,800
Next day he falls,
protects his bad hand,

207
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,200
then he breaks his good one.
He breaks that one, too.

208
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,500
So now he's got two busted flippers,
so I said to him,

209
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,500
"Creighton, I hope
your wife really loves you,

210
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:41,000
'cause for the next five weeks
you can't even wipe your own ass."

211
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,900
That's the test, ain't it?
Test of true love.

212
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,700
I got a job for you.

213
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,400
If the pay's right and it's legal,
I'll do it.

214
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It's not strictly legal.

215
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,800
If the pay's right, I'll do it.

216
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,200
It's in reference to that gentleman
and my wife.

217
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,200
The more I think about it,

218
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,900
the more irritated I get.

219
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,000
Could you tell me what you want me
to do, or is it a secret?

220
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,200
This is no joke.

221
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,000
You want me to kill 'em.

222
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Well?

223
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,400
Well, what?

224
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,000
What do you think?

225
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
You're an idiot.

226
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,100
So, this wouldn't interest you, huh?

227
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,600
I didn't say that. All I said was
you're an idiot.

228
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,400
You've been thinking about it so much
it's driving you simple.

229
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,800
I'll give you 10,000 dollars.

230
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,700
I'm supposed to do a murder,

231
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,600
or two murders,

232
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,200
and trust you
not to go simple on me

233
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,800
and do something stupid.
I mean

234
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,900
really stupid.

235
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,800
Why should I trust you?

236
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,800
For the money.

237
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,800
The money.

238
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,300
That's a right lot of money.

239
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,000
In Russia,

240
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,300
they make only fifty cents a day.

241
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,800
I want you...

242
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,600
to go fishing.

243
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,200
What?
- Go down to Corpus for a few days.

244
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,200
Get yourself noticed.

245
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,800
I'll give you a call when it's done.

246
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,000
You just find a way
to cover that money.

247
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,100
I'll take care of the money.
You make sure

248
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,700
those bodies aren't found.

249
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,600
There's a big incinerator
behind my place.

250
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
Do you want

251
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,800
like a townhouse?
Or your own apartment?

252
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,300
I'll show you around.

253
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,200
Are you sure this apartment is vacant?

254
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,900
Yes! I was just explaining to him

255
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,700
that he moved out yesterday.

256
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,900
Don't mind Mr. Garcia.
He used to be my brother-in-law.

257
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,700
Looks like the state legislature
is out of session.

258
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,200
I thought this was where they met.
- You're gonna help me.

259
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,500
I am? - Keep an eye on Mary and Ray.
Make sure nothing happens.

260
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,500
Let's show our appreciation
for Lorraine.

261
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,100
A registered nurse from Bolton, Texas.
How about it, gentlemen?

262
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,700
Alright, see you, Meurice.
Any time.

263
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,300
You don't have to worry for a while.
Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.

264
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,300
He's in the house!

265
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,300
He's in the house.

266
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
What's the matter?

267
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,000
I could have sworn I heard something.
- Door's locked.

268
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,700
Nothin' there.

269
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,500
Well,

270
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,800
we wouldn't have heard anything,
if it'd been him. He's real careful.

271
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,600
Fact is...

272
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,200
he's anal.

273
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,400
He told me himself. He said,

274
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,700
"In here,

275
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,200
in here I'm anal."

276
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,800
I'll be damned!

277
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,400
I couldn't believe it myself.

278
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,400
Me, on the other hand,
I got lots of personality.

279
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,800
Marty always said I had too much.
He was never big on personality.

280
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,300
He sent me to a psychiatrist
to see if he could calm me down.

281
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,800
Yeah?

282
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,900
What happened?
- Psychiatrist said

283
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,200
I was the healthiest person
he ever met. Marty fired him.

284
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,000
I don't think
you can fire a psychiatrist.

285
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,500
I never saw him again,
I can tell you that. I said,

286
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,300
"Marty, how come you're anal
and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?"

287
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,800
What did he say?

288
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,200
Nothing.
He's like you. He doesn't say much.

289
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,800
Thanks.

290
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,200
Except when he doesn't say things,
they're usually nasty.

291
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,700
When you don't,
they're usually nice.

292
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:04,000
You ever get tired?
- Oh yeah, I guess.

293
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,100
Hello?
- Marty?

294
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,900
Catch any fish?

295
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
What?

296
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,800
Catch any fish?

297
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,400
What kind of fish?
- Listen, is it done?

298
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,100
Yes, sir. You owe me some money.

299
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,400
If you're fucking with me,
you'll regret it.

300
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,300
They look good.

301
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Why? You want a couple?

302
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Just the 10,000 will be fine.

303
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,600
You got something to show me first?

304
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Dead?

305
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,300
So it seems.

306
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,000
What'd you do with the bodies?
- Taken care of.

307
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,600
The less you know about it,
the better.

308
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,800
Jesus!

309
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,600
I don't believe it.

310
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,600
I'm gonna be sick.

311
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm gonna want that picture back.

312
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,700
You did say something about the money.

313
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,600
Yeah, the money.

314
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,800
Something I gotta ask you.

315
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,000
I've been very, very careful.

316
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,400
Have you been very, very careful?

317
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,600
Of course.
- Nobody knows you hired me?

318
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Don't be stupid.

319
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,800
I'm not about to tell anyone.

320
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,600
We have to learn to be discreet.

321
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,300
Trust each other.

322
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,900
For richer, for poorer.

323
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,800
Don't say that. Your marriages
don't turn out so hot.

324
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,000
How did you cover the money?
- It's been taken care of.

325
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,800
The less you know about it,
the better.

326
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,100
I made a call.

327
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,000
It'll be all right.

328
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,700
I must've gone money simple.

329
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,300
A murder like this...

330
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,200
...too risky.

331
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,600
You shouldn't have done it.

332
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,600
Can't have it both ways.

333
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,700
Count it

334
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,200
and go.

335
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,100
I trust you.

336
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,100
Who looks stupid now?

337
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,400
Damn!

338
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,100
What's the matter? You deaf?

339
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,500
You home?

340
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,400
What night is tonight?

341
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,100
What night is it?

342
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,600
Tuesday?
- Tuesday night is ladies' night.

343
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,900
What?
- Tuesday night is ladies' night.

344
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,000
All your drinks are free.

345
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,400
...increased over 80%

346
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,500
in the last three years.
What's more,

347
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,300
in two years' time we'll be
experiencing the Jupiter effect.

348
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:53,800
Then all the planets in the universe
will cause this unbelievable...

349
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
...and these will be the sons
of which we shall know.

350
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,600
Although real good people
disagree with me,

351
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,800
I believe

352
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,100
that this Antichrist
is alive today

353
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:28,400
living in the ten nation alliance
I was talking about...

354
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,200
This is WKLJ,

355
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,100
"Through the Night."

356
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,700
I'm John Lievsay.

357
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:42,800
I'll be with you till six this morning
when Mike Miller will be stepping in.

358
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,400
Here's a request
we really had to dig for.

359
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,000
Abby, you all right?

360
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,500
Ray? What time is it?

361
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,500
I don't know. It's early.

362
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,600
I love you.

363
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,000
You all right?

364
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,300
I don't know.

365
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,100
I better get off now.

366
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,500
I'll see you.

367
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,600
Thanks, Ray.

368
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:06,900
Shit!

369
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,300
Why didn't you get into bed?

370
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:15,500
I didn't think I could sleep.

371
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,800
I'm surprised you could.

372
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,400
You called me this morning.

373
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,600
I wanted to let you know
that everything was all right.

374
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:31,400
I took care of everything.

375
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,900
All we have to do is keep our heads.

376
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,800
What do you mean?
- I know about it.

377
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,700
I went to the bar last night.
- What happened?

378
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:45,600
Was Meurice there?
- Yeah.

379
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,300
But he didn't see me though.

380
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,700
Nobody saw me.

381
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,000
Is it cold in here?

382
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,700
What happened?

383
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,100
I cleaned it all up.

384
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:08,100
But that ain't important.
What we do now is important.

385
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,800
We can't go around half-cocked.

386
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,900
We need time to think about this.

387
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,800
Figure it out.

388
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,800
We got some time now,

389
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,500
but we gotta be smart.

390
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,600
Never point a gun at anyone
unless you mean to shoot him.

391
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,600
And if you shoot,
make sure he's dead.

392
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
'cause if he ain't,
he's gonna kill you.

393
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,000
It's the only thing we learned
in the service that's worth a goddamn.

394
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,200
Where the hell's my windbreaker?

395
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,800
Tell me what happened.

396
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,300
That ain't important.

397
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,300
What's important is that we did it.
Only that matters.

398
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,000
We both did it for each other.

399
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:07,500
That's what's important. - Don't know
what you're talking about.

400
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,900
I mean,

401
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,200
what are you talking about?

402
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,200
I haven't done anything funny.

403
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,100
What was that?

404
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,600
You're not even acting like yourself.

405
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:28,000
First, you call me at 5 a.m.,
saying all kinds of nice things,

406
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:33,400
then you come chargin' in, scaring me
half to death without telling me why.

407
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,200
I mean,

408
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:41,300
if you two had a fight...
I don't care,

409
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,900
just as long as...

410
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:53,400
Pick it up.

411
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,800
What?

412
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,000
Well, it's him.

413
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,200
Who?

414
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,300
What's going on with you two?

415
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,700
All right.

416
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,400
You can call him back,
whoever it was.

417
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,700
I'll get out of your way.

418
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,300
You left your weapon behind.

419
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,900
Hi, Meurice, this is Helene Trend.

420
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,600
What the hell does that remark
you made about Sylvia mean?

421
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:53,300
She says you're full of shit.
I believe her, and I love you, too.

422
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:58,000
Call me soon, 'cause I'm goin'
to South America tonight, to Uruguay.

423
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,800
Listen, asshole, it's Marty.

424
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:04,600
I just got back from Corpus Christi.
A lot of money's missing.

425
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,300
I'm not saying you took it,
but the place was your responsibility.

426
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,300
I told you to keep an eye
on your asshole friend.

427
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,300
Don't come to the bar tonight...

428
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,200
What is this?

429
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:20,700
The bar's gonna be closed tonight.
I got business to do. But tomorrow

430
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:25,200
I wanna have a word with you and Ray,
if you can find him.

431
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,600
I hope you're planning
on leaving town.

432
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,400
You got a problem?

433
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,800
No, but you do, cowboy.
- Have you been to the bar? - Why?

434
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,700
You shouldn't have taken
the fuckin' money! Look at me!

435
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:16,500
I'm serious! You broke in the bar
and ripped off the fuckin' safe!

436
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,800
Abby warned me about you.
Know what your problem is?

437
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:24,600
You're too fuckin' obvious. Only you
and me know the combination, and Abby,

438
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,400
maybe.
These fuckin' things are coffin nails!

439
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,000
Hey, look.

440
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:36,300
I don't give a shit. Marty is
a hard-on, but you gotta do somethin'.

441
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:41,500
Say you're sorry. Give the money back.
Get the fuck outta here... something!

442
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,500
Shit!

443
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,600
It's very humiliating
preaching about this bullshit!

444
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,900
But I'm not laughin'.
So you know it's no fuckin' joke!

445
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,900
Damn!

446
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,100
Lover boy oughta lock the door.

447
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,300
I love you.

448
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,700
Stupid thing to say, right.

449
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,800
I love you, too.

450
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,200
No.

451
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,800
You're just saying that,
because you're scared.

452
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,300
You left your weapon behind.

453
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,800
He'll kill you, too.

454
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,800
Where is everything?

455
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,100
In the trunk.

456
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,800
In the car.

457
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,400
You leavin'?

458
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,500
Isn't that what you want?

459
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,600
Wanna come with me?

460
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,500
I gotta know what happened first.

461
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,400
What d'you wanna know?

462
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,200
You broke into the bar.
You wanted to get your money.

463
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,500
You and Marty had a fight.
And something happened...

464
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:43,000
I don't know...
Wasn't it you?

465
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,900
Maybe a burglar broke in...
- With your gun.

466
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,500
Nobody broke in.

467
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,400
I'll tell you the truth.

468
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,200
Truth is...

469
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:11,500
I've been feelin' sick
the last couple of days.

470
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,300
Can't sleep.

471
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,200
Can't eat.

472
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:26,600
When I try...

473
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,700
Truth is,

474
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,700
he was alive when I buried him.

475
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,400
Yeah, just a second!

476
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:17,300
What's the matter? - I think
Marty's dead. Can I come in?

477
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,700
That's bullshit! Marty called me
after he was jacked up.

478
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:48,800
I don't know where Marty is,
but he's not dead.

479
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,100
You relax, and I'll go find him.

480
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,700
And stay away from Ray.
The guy's gone nuts.

481
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,900
Turn it off.

482
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,400
Just turn it off!

483
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,800
Why?

484
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,100
No curtains on the windows.

485
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,700
So?

486
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:07,600
I think someone's watchin'.
- So what'll they see?

487
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,400
Leave it off!

488
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:12,800
If you do anything
the neighbors'll hear.

489
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,600
You think...

490
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,500
I meant it...

491
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,300
when I called.

492
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,700
I love you, too.

493
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:36,400
You're scared.

494
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,300
All right.

495
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:38,700
You got some of my personal property.

496
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,500
One of you do.

497
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:07,000
I don't know what the hell you two
thought you were gonna pull off.

498
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:14,500
I'm not afraid of you, Marty.

499
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Well, ma'am.

500
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,600
If I see him,
I'll sure give him the message.
