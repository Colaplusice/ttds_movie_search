{1920}{2031}Christmas comes but once a year
{2040}{2150}For every girl and boy
{2175}{2295}The laughter and the joy
{2295}{2416}They find in each new toy
{2440}{2563}I'll tell you of a little boy
{2565}{2687}Who lives across the way
{2699}{2825}This little fella 's Christmas
{2840}{2880}Is just another day
{5690}{5765}It was just before dawn
{5770}{5840}One miserable morning
{5850}{5920}In black '44
{5980}{6125}When the forward commander|was told to sit tight
{6146}{6280}When he asked that|his men be withdrawn
{6360}{6435}And the generals gave thanks
{6440}{6490}As the other ranks
{6505}{6600}Held back the enemy tanks|for a while.
{6695}{6727}And the Anzio bridgehead
{6748}{6825}Was held for the price
{6828}{6921}Of a few hundred ordinary lives
{7700}{7768}He's the little boy
{7775}{7943}That Santa Claus forgot
{7980}{8045}And Goodness knows
{8060}{8215}He didn 't want a lot
{8245}{8310}He sent a note to Santa
{8382}{8512}For some soldiers and a drum
{8530}{8625}It broke his little heart
{8633}{8770}When he found Santa hadn't come
{8800}{8864}In the street he envies
{8868}{8980}All those lucky boys
{13449}{13521}So ya thought ya
{13522}{13581}Might like to
{13583}{13642}Go to the show
{13744}{13862}To feel the warm thrill|of confusion
{13864}{13960}That space cadet glow
{14010}{14156}Tell me, is something|eluding you, sunshine
{14159}{14290}Is this not what|you expected to see
{14292}{14437}If you wanna find out|what's behind these cold eyes
{14438}{14594}You'll just have to|claw your way through this disguise
{19026}{19100}Mama loves her baby
{19180}{19286}And Daddy loves you too
{19340}{19495}And the sea may look|warm to you, babe
{19500}{19577}And the sky may look blue
{19640}{19791}Ooh, ooh, ooh
{19793}{19856}Ooh, babe
{19965}{20080}Ooh, ooh, ooh
{20085}{20158}Baby blue
{20395}{20484}Ooh, ooh, ooh
{20485}{20609}Ooh, ooh, babe
{20650}{20745}If you should go skating
{20765}{20870}On the thin ice of modern life
{20940}{21016}Dragging behind you
{21015}{21090}The silent reproach
{21098}{21235}Of a million tear-stained eyes
{21280}{21410}Don 't be surprised|when a crack in the ice
{21440}{21565}Appears under your feet
{21572}{21740}You slip out of your depth|and out of your mind
{21750}{21855}With you fear|flowing out behind you
{21860}{21970}As you claw the thin ice
{23716}{23880}Daddys flown |across the ocean
{24005}{24155}Leaving just a memory
{24290}{24455}A snapshot in the family album
{24590}{24815}Daddy, what else|did you leave for me?
{24945}{25055}Daddy, what'd ya leave |behind for me?
{25200}{25346}All in all it was|just a brick in the wall.
{25480}{25660}All in all it was all|just bricks in the wall.
{26720}{26800}- What?|- Will you put me on there?
{26800}{26890}- Well, where's your mother, then?|- She's gone to the shops.
{26895}{26920}Yes, all right.
{27000}{27090}How's that then? Enjoying it?
{27280}{27328}Lovely, lovely.
{27620}{27688}Now off you go.|Go on.
{27780}{27870}Now what have I told you about this?|What have I told you?
{27875}{28000}Go on, go on now. Sling your hook.|Go on. Sling your hook.
{31590}{31645}And kind old King George
{31650}{31740}Sent Mother a note
{31740}{31842}When he heard that Father was gone
{31910}{31975}It was, I recall
{31985}{32080}In the form of a scroll
{32085}{32170}Gold leaf and all
{32240}{32325}And I found it one day...
{32325}{32430}In a drawer of old photographs...
{32430}{32485}Hidden away.
{32540}{32660}And my eyes still grow damp|to remember
{32670}{32870}His Majesty signed|with his own rubber stamp.
{32920}{33000}It was dark all around
{33010}{33078}There was frost in the ground
{33082}{33217}When the tigers broke free
{33270}{33340}And no one survived
{33350}{33530}From the Royal Fusiliers |Company C
{33600}{33695}They were all left behind
{33700}{33780}Most of them dead
{33775}{33885}The rest of them dying
{33945}{34045}And that's how the high command
{34055}{34185}Took my daddy, from me.
{35990}{36110}Did you see the frightened ones?
{36125}{36230}Did you hear the falling bombs?
{36250}{36390}Did you ever wonder why|we had to run for shelter
{36391}{36577}When the promise of a brave new world|unfurled beneath the clear blue sky?
{37050}{37150}Did you see the frightened ones?
{37180}{37290}Did you hear the falling bombs?
{37320}{37480}The flames are all long gone|but the pain lingers on.
{37570}{37620}Good-bye
{37625}{37684}Blue sky
{37710}{37805}Good-bye, blue sky
{37810}{37865}Good-bye
{37950}{38005}Good-bye
{38214}{38280}Wait for me, Pinky,|you rotten bleeder.
{38290}{38365}- They're my bullets, ain't they?|- I don't know.
{38385}{38485}Come on, Tubs.|It's great down in the tunnel.
{38490}{38560}Don't you think|it'd be dangerous, Pinky?
{38560}{38620}No. Don't be daft.
{38970}{39070}- You all right, Tubs?|- Yeah. Hurt me knee a bit.
{39300}{39354}- Come on.|- Na. It's too dangerous.
{39352}{39475}- We'll wait for the train.|- Give me the torch.
{39745}{39818}- Pinky! Here comes the train !
{39822}{39950}- Get off the line,|you bloody idiot! Here it comes!
{39975}{40070}- Pinky, get off the line!|Here it comes!
{40110}{40160}- Pinky, get off the line!
{40688}{40720}- You !
{40805}{41062}- You! |Yes, you !
{40920}{40985}- Stand still, laddie!
{41660}{41720}When we grew up and went to school
{41740}{41925}There were certain teachers who would|hurt the children anyway they could
{42005}{42140}By pouring their derision|upon anything we did
{42146}{42215}Exposing every weakness
{42220}{42325}However carefully hidden|by the kids
{42350}{42410}- What have we here, laddie?
{42425}{42535}- Mysterious scribblings?|A secret code?
{42555}{42620}- No. Poems, no less.
{42630}{42680}- Poems, everybody!
{42698}{42790}- The lad here reckons himself|a poet.
{42800}{42890}- "Money, get back.|I'm all right, Jack.
{42891}{42975}- Keep your hands|off my stack.
{42985}{43085}- New car, caviar,|four-star daydream.
{43090}{43175}- Think I'll buy me|a football team."
{43170}{43225}- Absolute rubbish, laddie!
{43265}{43380}- Get on with your work.
{43370}{43410}- Repeat after me:
{43415}{43513}- An acre is the area|of a rectangle...
{43515}{43580}- whose length is one furlong...
{43585}{43670}- and whose width is one chain.
{43690}{43730}But in this town it was well known
{43731}{43850}When they got home at night|their fat and psychopathic wives
{43855}{43995}Would thrash them|within inches of their lives
{44525}{44675}We don 't need no education
{44790}{44955}We don't need no thought control
{45060}{45235}No dark sarcasm in the classroom
{45360}{45490}Teacher, leave them kids alone
{45665}{45845}Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone
{45920}{46080}All in all it's just|another brick in the wall
{46130}{46205}- Wrong! Do it again !
{46210}{46330}All in all you're just|another brick in the wall
{46465}{46595}We don 't need no education
{46600}{46680}- If you don't eat your meat,|you can't have any pudding!
{46682}{46976}We don't need no thought control
{46790}{46870}-  How can you have any pudding|if you don't eat your meat?
{46872}{47000}No dark sarcasm in the classroom
{47002}{47050}- You ! Yes, you, laddie!
{47052}{47160}- Poems, everybody.|The lad here reckons himself a poet.
{47162}{47320}Teachers, leave them kids alone
{47465}{47625}Hey, teacher, leave those kids alone
{47725}{47899}All in all you're just|another brick in the wall
{48002}{48170}All in all you're just|another brick in the wall
{49540}{49695}We don 't need no education
{50085}{50245}No dark sarcasm in the classroom
{50380}{50510}- Again. An acre is the area|of a rectangle...
{50512}{50573}- whose length is one furlong...
{50575}{50675}- and whose width is one chain.
{52220}{52380}Mother, do you think|they'll drop the bomb
{52700}{52860}Mother, do you think|they'll like the song
{53210}{53370}Mother, do you think|they'll try to break my balls
{53660}{53820}Mother, should I build the wall
{54560}{54720}Mother, should I run for president
{55060}{55220}Mother, should I trust the government
{55550}{55710}Mother, will they put me|in the firing line

{64410}{64465}- Hello?|- Yes, a collect call...
{64465}{64532}for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd.
{64533}{64640}- Will you accept the charge|from the United States?

{68800}{68860}Where waves
{68870}{68945}Of hunger
{68950}{69030}Roar
{69040}{69140}Shall we set out across
{69150}{69234}This sea
{69235}{69344}Of faces
{69345}{69459}In search of more
{69460}{69660}And more applause
{70160}{70299}Shall we buy a new guitar

{79310}{79360}- God.

{82430}{82520}We pretend it's all right
{82540}{82639}But I have grown older
{82640}{82739}And you have grown colder

{83445}{83510}Feel
{83540}{83639}Cold as a razor blade

{152500}{152590}Good morning, Worm, Your Honor
{152595}{152569}The crown will plainly show
{152670}{152779}The prisoner who now stands before you
{152780}{152920}Was caught red-handed showing feelings
{152930}{153050}Showing feelings|of an almost human nature
{153110}{153190}This will not do
{153215}{153290}Call the schoolmaster
{153300}{153370}I always said he'd come to no good,
{153372}{153444}and in the end, Your Honor
{153445}{153524}If they'd let me have my way
{153525}{153630}I could've flayed him into shape
{153650}{153739}But my hands were tied

{153810}{153919}Let him get away with murder
{153920}{154010}Let me hammer him today
{154095}{154184}Crazy
{154185}{154350}Toys in the attic|I am crazy
{154375}{154480}Truly gone fishing

{155195}{155284}You little shit|You're in it now
{155285}{155379}I hope they throw away the key
{155380}{155509}You should've talked to me|more often than you did
{155510}{155614}But no|You had to go your own way
{155615}{155729}Have you broken|any homes up lately
{155730}{155829}Just five minutes, Worm, Your Honor

{158038}{158200}There 's no need|for the jury to retire
{158225}{158304}In all my years of judging
{158305}{158344}I have never heard before
{158410}{158425}Of someone more deserving
{158427}{158609}The full penalty of law
{158610}{158684}The way you made them suffer
{158685}{158780}Your exquisite wife and mother
{158800}{158884}Fills me with the urge to defecate
{158985}{159169}Since, my friend|you have revealed your deepest fear

{165460}{165530}Walk up and down
{165532}{165590}Outside the wall
{165765}{165884}Some hand in hand
{165942}{166072}Some gathered together in bands
{166148}{166308}The bleeding hearts|and the artists
{166309}{166368}Make their stand
{166483}{166645}And when they've given you their all
{166648}{166733}Some stagger and fall
{166736}{166839}After all, it's not easy
{166907}{166982}Banging your heart
{166985}{167122}Against some mad bugger's wall
{169481}{169637}When they've given you their all
{169638}{169718}Some stagger and fall
