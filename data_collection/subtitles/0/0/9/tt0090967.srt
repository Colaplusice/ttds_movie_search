00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,151
Edna Million in a drop-dead suit

2
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,609
Dutch pink
on a downtown train

3
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,717
Two-dollar pistol
but the gun won't shoot

4
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:23,243
I'm in the corner
on the pouring rain

5
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:26,218
Sixteen men
on a deadman's chest

6
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,780
And I've been drinking
from a broken cup

7
00:00:28,852 --> 00:00:31,852
Two pairs of pants
and a mohair vest

8
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:34,380
I'm full ofbourbon
I can't stand up

9
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:37,235
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,300
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

11
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:42,674
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

12
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:45,425
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

13
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:48,493
Schiffer broke a bottle
on Morgan's head

14
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:50,932
And I've been stepping
on the devil's tail

15
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:54,096
Across the stripes
of a full moon's head

16
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:56,499
And through the bars
of a Cuban jail

17
00:00:56,565 --> 00:00:59,599
Bloody fingers
on a purple knife

18
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:02,352
A flamingo drinking
from a cocktail glass

19
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:05,072
I'm on the lawn
with someone else's wife

20
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:07,508
Admire the view
from up on top of the mast

21
00:01:07,573 --> 00:01:10,323
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

22
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:13,040
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

23
00:01:26,902 --> 00:01:29,586
Julie, what are you doing here?

24
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:31,694
Just watching
the light changing.

25
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,721
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

26
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,507
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

27
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:58,357
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

28
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:00,911
House is on fire
and your children are alone

29
00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:02,892
Hey

30
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:26,195
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

31
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:28,882
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

32
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:31,602
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

33
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:34,519
Your house is on fire
and your children are alone

34
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:46,414
You sleepin', baby?

35
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:11,287
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

36
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:14,200
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

37
00:03:14,265 --> 00:03:16,654
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

38
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,762
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

39
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,451
Yellow sheets
on a Hong Kong bed

40
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:24,942
Stazybo horn
and a Slingerland ride

41
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:27,952
To the carnival
is what she said

42
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:30,446
A hundred dollars
makes it dark inside

43
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:33,521
Edna Million
in a drop-dead suit

44
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:36,015
Dutch pink
on a downtown train

45
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:39,024
Two-dollar pistol
but the gun won't shoot

46
00:03:39,097 --> 00:03:41,519
I'm in the corner
on the pouring rain

47
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:44,212
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

48
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:47,315
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

49
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:49,807
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

50
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:52,915
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

51
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,003
- Only 'cause you don't...

52
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:36,346
'cause you don't
take care of me.

53
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:39,218
Or want me.

54
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,098
Or want to make
any kind of commitment to me.

55
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,646
I'm finished with you, Zack.

56
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:49,433
I'm completely finished with you.

57
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,250
Why don't you just go find yourself
some other little girl to be your pet?

58
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:54,204
That shouldn't be
difficult for you.

59
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:57,433
I've had it with you
and your fuckin' stupid radio shows.

60
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:00,632
- This is really fuckin' boring!

61
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:17,619
Okay. Okay.

62
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:20,027
We're not gonna
talk about that right now.

63
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:30,354
Look at you, Zack.
Look what you're doing to yourself.

64
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:34,006
You're digging your own grave.

65
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:40,056
Why can't you just
stay at one station a while?

66
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:46,034
Why do you always gotta go
fuck up your own future, huh?

67
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:53,465
What are you so afraid of, Zack?

68
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:57,757
Yeah, well, that's right, Laurette.
We can't live in the present forever.

69
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:01,748
Shit.

70
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:06,233
Okay, look, um,

71
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:19,454
Maybe you should just go back
to New York or Detroit or Baltimore.

72
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,389
You said you liked it there, remember?

73
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:27,260
Go back to one of them stations
where you used to work...

74
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:29,694
and ask them to give you
a second chance.

75
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:34,715
There's nothing wrong
with asking somebody for somethin'.

76
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:38,425
Why is that always
so fuckin' hard for you?

77
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:45,239
You're a good D.J., Zack.

78
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:49,817
All you got to do is learn
to jerk people off a little.

79
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:51,993
That's all they really want,
you know.

80
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:59,127
Well, I never jerk people off,
and you fuckin' know it, Laurette.

81
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,014
Okay. Okay, fine. Forget it.

82
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,623
I'm not talkin' to you
anymore, Zack. Okay?

83
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:08,543
I'm not talkin' to you anymore...

84
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:10,463
because you don't want
to fuckin' be here.

85
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:13,081
And I'm not gonna let you
play with me anymore!

86
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:23,770
I hate you.
You're so damn stubborn and stupid.

87
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,728
And I hate you.
I hate you.

88
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,647
And I'm an idiot
for being with you.

89
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:29,949
You got me embarrassed
on my own time.

90
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:35,835
You got no fuckin' future,
Zack, especially not with me.

91
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:37,760
Not the shoes.
Not the shoes.

92
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:40,280
- Not the shoes.
- No?

93
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,248
Come on, hit me, motherfucker!
Hit me! Hit me!

94
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:55,709
I guess it's over
between us, Laurette.

95
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,864
You know, Jack, we could
get some money together.

96
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:27,355
Except you always blowin' it.

97
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:31,258
You know, gamblin',
gettin' high, showin' off.

98
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,243
I have to have fun,
you know, baby?

99
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:37,023
Yeah, yeah, I know.

100
00:11:37,093 --> 00:11:39,810
You always makin'
big, big plans for tomorrow.

101
00:11:39,878 --> 00:11:42,333
You wanna know why?

102
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:44,446
'Cause you always fuckin' up today.

103
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:49,502
Look at what happened to that white girl
Julie that you started out with.

104
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:51,843
She is a mess now.

105
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,165
All the girls you got
are so messed up, except me.

106
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,670
I could tell you a lot of things about
yourself you never even thought about.

107
00:12:00,742 --> 00:12:02,946
Never even entered
your hatchet-shaped head.

108
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:06,306
But, you know,
you never can be too sure.

109
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,420
My mama used to say that
America is a big meltin' pot.

110
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:15,040
Because she used to say
when you bring it to a boil,

111
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:19,868
all the scum rises to the top.

112
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:23,772
So maybe there's hope
for you yet, Jack.

113
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:28,005
You listenin' to me?

114
00:12:29,703 --> 00:12:33,762
Shit. You don't understand
any kind of people.

115
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:38,141
Maybe that's your problem.
You sure don't understand women at all.

116
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,215
And a pimp is at least
supposed to understand women.

117
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:49,573
If you was a good pimp, you would have
hit me by now or done somethin'.

118
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:52,574
But I can just lay here
and talk forever...

119
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,917
and you won't hear
a single word,

120
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:58,366
like you don't even speak English.

121
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:00,992
Lost inside all them plans you got.

122
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:03,846
But I know about you, Jack.

123
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:06,530
Jack.

124
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,739
You sure can talk, can't you, baby?

125
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:20,830
- Yes?
- Hey, Jack. It's me, Gig.

126
00:13:20,905 --> 00:13:23,294
Ah, what do you want?
Man, I don't owe you anything.

127
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:25,987
Man, I got something I know
you gonna be interested in, Jack.

128
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:28,031
I doubt that very much.

129
00:13:28,104 --> 00:13:29,762
- You busy?
- Yes.

130
00:13:29,832 --> 00:13:31,872
- I just want to come up
and talk to you, Jack.
- Uh-huh.

131
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:35,261
- I wanna prove to you
I'm on your side, man.
- Uh-huh.

132
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:38,566
- Don't you got just
five minutes to talk?
- No, I don't.

133
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:41,699
- Come on, Jack.
- Just come up and make it short,
all right?

134
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,678
- I'm on my way up.
- Yeah.

135
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:49,984
Fatso's on his way up here.

136
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:57,378
Cover up the merchandise.

137
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,759
Just take this, in case he's gotten
any smarter lately, all right?

138
00:14:58,123 --> 00:15:00,033
Hi, Jack. Where you at?

139
00:15:04,298 --> 00:15:06,208
Hi, babe.

140
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,985
She nice.

141
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,340
Jack, I know how you feel about me...

142
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:16,386
after what happened
down in Jefferson Parish...

143
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:19,972
with that spy boy,
and I don't blame you one bit.

144
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:22,564
But you too serious.

145
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:25,766
You gotta let
the past be the past, Jack.

146
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:29,643
I come here tonight
to settle us up.

147
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:31,594
Now how you gonna be
doin' that, fathead?

148
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,784
By doin' you a favor, a really big favor.
I'm as serious as cancer.

149
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,667
Man, whatever this is,
I know it's bullshit.

150
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:42,955
Jack, I have been tryin' to find a way
to straighten us out,

151
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,573
and I finally come up with it.

152
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:50,500
- Please, let bygones be bygones.

153
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:54,565
Man, I can see why you might
wanna be on my good side.

154
00:15:54,636 --> 00:15:58,531
You wanna do me a favor 'cause you know...
you know I'm gonna be big...

155
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:01,921
- and you wanna be in on it.
- All right, it's no secret.

156
00:16:01,996 --> 00:16:03,971
I know where you're headed.

157
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:07,721
But just hear me out,
see my little gift,

158
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:11,171
- and then if you're not interested,
let me know.
- What's the gift?

159
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:13,186
Oh, man, you gonna die.

160
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,254
I have got a piece of chicken you ain't
even gonna believe is from this planet.

161
00:16:17,325 --> 00:16:21,994
- No, that I might believe.
- Oh, Jack, be serious, man.

162
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,508
This girl is 19.
A beautiful white girl.

163
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:30,218
A Cajun goddess, man.
A Cajun goddess.

164
00:16:30,285 --> 00:16:33,253
I got her up at
the Belle Chasse Hotel right now.

165
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,397
And she's waiting there
for you, Jack.

166
00:16:35,469 --> 00:16:40,619
My gift to you. The most beautifulest
gift that I could possibly give you.

167
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:43,533
I mean, I can't believe you think
I'm gonna fall for this.

168
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:48,132
Hey, go over there, check it out.

169
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:53,061
If I'm crazy or lyin',
you don't lose nothin'.

170
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:56,711
Matter of fact, I just wanted
to give you first shot at her,

171
00:16:56,781 --> 00:17:00,556
before she all used up,
because she is gorgeous, man.

172
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:02,531
Then why don't you want her, man?

173
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,613
Why don't you give her
to one of your so-called real friends,

174
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:06,726
one of those assholes
down on Decatur Street, huh?

175
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:09,481
Because I've been trying
to make us be friends again.

176
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,589
Can't you just accept that?

177
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:17,127
All right. And I suppose
you haven't even touched her, right?

178
00:17:19,374 --> 00:17:21,546
All right, I'll go look
at your martian goddess.

179
00:17:21,615 --> 00:17:24,036
But I'm telling you something.
If you're foolin' with me,

180
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,558
if you're wastin' my time, if anythin',
I'm gonna fuck you up.

181
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,486
I guarantee it.

182
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:33,163
Jack, nobody's gonna regret anythin',
especially not you.

183
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:35,086
In fact, you're gonna
thank me for this.

184
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:37,453
You're gonna remember me
for the rest of your life for this.

185
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:39,428
Yeah? Okay.

186
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:13,997
- You makin' any money, baby?
- Ain't nothin' happenin'.

187
00:18:14,064 --> 00:18:17,293
- Pretty thing like you? Why not?
- I don't know.

188
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,288
- All right. Check you out later.
- All right, Jack.

189
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:26,887
- Hey, L.C. What's happenin'?
- Hey, Jack. Good to see you.

190
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,814
Out kinda early this evenin', huh?

191
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,727
- Yeah. I got some things to check out.
- How's the ladies treatin' you?

192
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:34,280
- Ow.
- Well, you know, Jack, how that goes.

193
00:18:34,352 --> 00:18:37,549
If you get enough of it,
do like a crawfish. Back on out of it.

194
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,983
- I'll see you, L.C.
- All right. Take care, Jack.

195
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:48,649
- Hey, Julie. How's it goin'?
- All right.

196
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:50,630
Hang in there now.

197
00:19:29,713 --> 00:19:31,884
I heard you're lookin'
for someone to take care of you.

198
00:19:35,698 --> 00:19:38,665
Now what you want is someone
who's gonna treat you like a lady.

199
00:19:38,738 --> 00:19:43,178
I don't know if you've been on the streets
here or not, but they can be very serious.

200
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,487
These guys...

201
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:48,718
I mean, chances are you're
gonna find somebody
who's gonna get you strung out...

202
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:51,437
'cause he's strung out,
and then he's gonna own you.

203
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,793
Some guy's gonna cut you,
and hurt you.

204
00:19:56,435 --> 00:19:59,948
With me, you're gonna be makin' money.
You're gonna have jewelry.

205
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:04,525
Whatever you want. Check it out.
I got the right connects.

206
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:06,961
My thing is organized.

207
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:10,158
You work with me,
I'm gonna take care of you.

208
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:12,682
Don't shoot me! Don't...

209
00:20:14,738 --> 00:20:17,226
- Where you at, Jack?
- Mandino, what are you doin'?

210
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,306
Man, I'm here with my girlfriend.

211
00:20:25,587 --> 00:20:29,068
This is ridiculous, man.
What are you tryin' to pull on me?

212
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:32,138
Jack.

213
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:35,507
Jack, Jack.
You're a sick son of a bitch.

214
00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:40,816
- Is that your girlfriend?
- Man, you know I'm not
into this kinda... Ow!

215
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:43,753
Get this son of a bitch out of here.
Get this pervert out of here!

216
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:47,564
Shit.

217
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:52,687
Okay, Rich.

218
00:20:52,756 --> 00:20:55,276
I'll take care of the kid.

219
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,620
It's okay, darlin'.
Everything's all right.

220
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:05,803
It's all over now.

221
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:12,275
Look, we're just gonna...
we're gonna sit here for a little while,

222
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,089
and then you're gonna...
you're gonna come with me.

223
00:21:16,469 --> 00:21:19,338
Now, I don't want you
to worry about anything, understand?

224
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,392
Don't worry about a thing,
because I'm gonna take care of you.

225
00:21:53,461 --> 00:21:55,762
And she said

226
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:02,642
- Well, where you were

227
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:06,703
Oh, baby, don't go slow

228
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:10,961
- Take me now

229
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,642
Oh, she don't know

230
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,776
Is a sad and beautiful world.

231
00:22:17,846 --> 00:22:20,813
- Huh?

232
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:24,498
Yeah, it's a sad
and beautiful world, pal.

233
00:22:25,622 --> 00:22:27,695
That's a good one.

234
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,486
Yeah, yeah

235
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:36,820
Ah, buzz off, pal.

236
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:39,920
Thank you.

237
00:22:42,871 --> 00:22:44,726
No, buzz off.

238
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:47,508
- Ah, buzz off. Ah, buzz off.

239
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,739
Buzz off. Buzz off.

240
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:55,412
Buzz off. Buzz... off.

00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:57,617
Good evening.
Buzz off to everybody.

242
00:22:57,686 --> 00:23:00,305
Oh, thank you. Buzz off to you too.
Oh, uh, it's a pleasure.

243
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,230
Thank you.

244
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:10,706
Oh, lady, now, now

245
00:23:10,775 --> 00:23:15,347
It's a sad and beautiful world

246
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:21,168
It's a sad and beautiful world

247
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:26,095
It is a sad and beautiful world, yeah

248
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:31,574
It's a sad and beautiful world

249
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:37,648
It's a sad and beautiful world

250
00:23:39,288 --> 00:23:41,427
Now

251
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:45,424
To the end

252
00:23:45,496 --> 00:23:49,173
She's just
She's just a shadow, baby

253
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,957
Zack. My man.

254
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,696
What the fuck you doin'
out here in the garbage?

255
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,767
Just leave me alone, Preston.

256
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,728
I'm in a bad mood.

257
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:06,288
Well, I'm just the man
you've been lookin' for.

258
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,492
In fact, I been lookin' for you.

259
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:13,936
- That's a bad sign.
- Now, Zack, baby.

260
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:16,376
I got somethin' real good for you.

261
00:24:17,753 --> 00:24:20,568
An hour's work
for a whole lot of scratch.

262
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:24,561
- I ain't interested, man.
- Man, you are in a bad mood.

263
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:28,016
- You ain't even let me
propose this shit to you.

264
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:30,839
Just listen to me
for one minute, will you?

265
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:34,003
One minute of your, uh,
valuable time.

266
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:40,055
- Just fuck off, Preston.

267
00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:48,758
All I want to do
is pay you a grand...

268
00:24:48,826 --> 00:24:54,009
in exchange for a single hour
of your very, very valuable time.

269
00:24:54,074 --> 00:24:58,351
Now this ain't no breaking and entering
or small-time chump change.

270
00:24:58,426 --> 00:25:03,282
No delivery of controlled substances.
None of that stuff.

271
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:08,624
This is just to drive a car
from one part of town to the other, alone.

272
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:13,430
That's it.

273
00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:16,761
Well, what kind of car
would that be, Preston?

274
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:21,169
- That would be a very nice car.

275
00:25:21,242 --> 00:25:25,104
A very nice, very expensive
imported car...

276
00:25:25,178 --> 00:25:28,495
which just happens to be
between owners at the present time.

277
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,051
Oh, I see.
Just in between owners.

278
00:25:32,123 --> 00:25:35,701
Look, all you got to do, man,
is drive the car across town,

279
00:25:35,771 --> 00:25:38,357
park it, leave it.

280
00:25:38,427 --> 00:25:41,361
And, look, I'm gonna
give you half up front and half later.

281
00:25:41,435 --> 00:25:44,337
The whole thing's over in an hour.

282
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:47,760
Very safe, very clean.

283
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:51,796
And believe me, I could get
a million guys to do this for me.

284
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:55,031
Well, then, why don't you
do it yourself?

285
00:25:55,099 --> 00:25:59,572
I'm offering a grand so I don't have
to answer stupid questions like that.

286
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:06,673
Well, I might consider a grand up front.

287
00:26:08,924 --> 00:26:11,095
Then I might think about it.

288
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:13,073
Jesus Christ.

289
00:26:18,108 --> 00:26:21,142
Zack, you are in a nasty mood.

290
00:26:22,428 --> 00:26:25,689
Now, just to make you
cheer up a little bit,

291
00:26:25,756 --> 00:26:30,164
- I'll give you 750 in front, okay?
- Shit.

292
00:26:30,236 --> 00:26:34,677
All right, all right,
Mr. Almighty Hot Shit.

293
00:26:34,748 --> 00:26:36,690
Look, I'm gonna do you this favor.

294
00:26:38,716 --> 00:26:41,684
Oh, man. AJaguar, huh?

295
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:48,280
Look, man, I'm gonna
give you the whole thing, up front.

296
00:26:49,853 --> 00:26:51,763
And you gonna owe me one.

297
00:26:58,301 --> 00:27:01,617
Zack, you can buy yourself
20 girls for all of that.

298
00:27:06,653 --> 00:27:09,206
Yeah, sure, man.

299
00:27:17,117 --> 00:27:19,484
Then she said what

300
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,095
I just want to know

301
00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:25,816
Shoop, shoop

302
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:28,602
Shoop, shoop

303
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:31,637
-  Shoop

304
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:38,196
Motherfucker.

305
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,983
Take it slow

306
00:27:46,654 --> 00:27:49,207
All right, baby. You got it.

307
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:03,030
- How you doin', baby?

308
00:28:03,103 --> 00:28:05,274
All right. Shit.

309
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,437
Well, I ain't goin' back to Detroit,
and that's for damn sure.

310
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:20,117
Shit.

311
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,120
You can bet your ass I'm a good D.J.

312
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:31,448
Shit. WWOZ, WHLO.

313
00:28:33,247 --> 00:28:36,182
WAKR. Just check it out.

314
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:46,749
Oh, we're comin' up on the midnight hour
here on the Lee Baby Simms Show.

315
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,718
Yeah.

316
00:28:50,784 --> 00:28:55,224
Well, it's a Tuesday night.
Gimme a call down here at the station.

317
00:28:55,296 --> 00:28:59,191
Our lines are open. Let the Lee Baby
know that you still love him.

318
00:29:03,136 --> 00:29:05,111
Yeah.

319
00:29:05,184 --> 00:29:08,500
I'm gonna be sending
this one out to, uh...

320
00:29:08,576 --> 00:29:10,486
out to you, Laurette.

321
00:29:14,528 --> 00:29:17,692
I was all right

322
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,444
For a while

323
00:29:20,513 --> 00:29:24,571
I could smile
I could smile

324
00:29:44,353 --> 00:29:46,263
You in the Jag. Pull it over.

325
00:29:46,337 --> 00:29:48,345
Son of a bitch.

326
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,621
Out of the car, asshole. Out!

327
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,133
Get your ass out of there.

328
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:01,111
What?

329
00:30:03,073 --> 00:30:06,422
- Was I goin' a little too fast?
- Hands up on the hood, jackass! Move!

330
00:30:08,354 --> 00:30:11,136
- Move!
- Spread 'em out.

331
00:30:11,202 --> 00:30:13,569
Come on, get a little
goosey-goosey goin' here.

332
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:16,797
- What are you lookin' at?
- Your ugly face.

333
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:19,070
- Hook him up.
- Oh, hook him up.

334
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:21,440
Hook him good.
Twist it a little bit.

335
00:30:21,506 --> 00:30:23,449
Watch it, rookie.

336
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:29,015
- I ain't done nothin'.
- Get your ass back. Get your ass back.

337
00:30:29,091 --> 00:30:32,703
I don't care if you done nothin'.
Let's see what we got here.

338
00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:34,909
- It's my car.
- It's your ass.

339
00:30:34,978 --> 00:30:38,142
- Shit. What are you lookin' at, dogface?
- Shut up.

340
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:42,493
- Maybe we get a little
lagniappe in the trunk.
- Oh, yeah?

341
00:30:42,563 --> 00:30:44,537
You got nothin' on me.

342
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:55,449
- He's the one, Herb.
- It's all wrong, man.

343
00:30:55,523 --> 00:30:59,417
Put the smart-ass in the car.

344
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,433
- In the car. No, asshole!
- Come on!

345
00:31:01,507 --> 00:31:04,028
- You set me up! You set me up!
- Come on!

346
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:06,652
- In the car, asshole!
- You motherfucker!

347
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:09,244
You set me up!

348
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:11,224
You son of a bitch!

349
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:43,365
- Hey, baby.
- Yeah, right.

350
00:33:49,703 --> 00:33:51,613
In here.

351
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:02,086
Excuse me.
Now can I get a light for my cigarette?

352
00:34:02,152 --> 00:34:05,087
- Didn't I give you
a match this morning?
- That was five, six hours ago.

353
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,258
- I'll be back in a couple ofhours.
- Man, come on.

354
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,990
Shit.

355
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:53,219
Guard!
I need a light here!

356
00:34:55,241 --> 00:34:57,412
I can't believe this.

357
00:34:57,481 --> 00:35:01,824
Guard! Guard! Guard! Guard!
Guard! Guard! Guard!

358
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:06,402
What am I doin' in here?

359
00:35:09,897 --> 00:35:12,069
Can't you see?

360
00:35:12,138 --> 00:35:16,066
You are not
the only innocent asshole in here.

361
00:35:19,722 --> 00:35:21,632
I was set up too.

362
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:25,407
Just like you.

363
00:35:27,082 --> 00:35:28,708
Just like you.

364
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:30,949
Man, I am not just like you,
whatever you say.

365
00:35:31,018 --> 00:35:32,960
I don't even want to deal with you.
You got it, man?

366
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:36,263
As far as I'm concerned,
you don't even exist. Not at all.

367
00:35:37,259 --> 00:35:39,168
Got it?

368
00:35:57,803 --> 00:35:59,712
Well, you don't exist either.

369
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:09,985
The walls don't exist.

370
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,210
The floor doesn't exist.

371
00:36:16,555 --> 00:36:20,647
This prison's not here.
These bunks aren't here.

372
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,570
The bars aren't here.

373
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:31,107
None of this is really here.

374
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,338
None of this is really here at all.

375
00:36:46,156 --> 00:36:48,807
What's the matter with you, man?

376
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:51,112
Huh?
What's goin' on inside there?

377
00:36:53,388 --> 00:36:55,298
You haven't said nothin'
in three days.

378
00:36:56,556 --> 00:36:59,207
Man, you gotta say somethin'.
Just say somethin'.

379
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:03,394
Fuck you.

380
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,358
Fuck you. Fuck you.
Fuck you. Fuck you.

381
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:11,527
Okay, fuck you.
That's fine.

382
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:16,962
You piss me off, you know that?

383
00:37:22,797 --> 00:37:25,001
Man, you know what I'm gonna do
when I get out of here?

384
00:37:27,437 --> 00:37:29,379
When I get out of here,

385
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:34,284
there's gonna be a white limousine.

386
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:37,764
It's gonna come and pick me up.

387
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:39,747
It's gonna be a Lincoln.

388
00:37:41,069 --> 00:37:42,979
I'm gonna step inside...

389
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:49,162
and inside it's bigger than you could
possibly imagine it from the outside.

390
00:37:51,885 --> 00:37:55,147
And there's gonna be beautiful girls
in there, four of'em,

391
00:37:55,213 --> 00:37:57,123
and they're all gonna be naked.

392
00:37:59,566 --> 00:38:03,559
And one of'em's gonna
offer me some coke.

393
00:38:04,653 --> 00:38:06,563
But I'm gonna just say no.

394
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:15,304
I'm gonna just be enjoying
the luxury of the car and the girls.

395
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:18,666
And the door's gonna close,

396
00:38:18,734 --> 00:38:20,644
and it's just gonna go "click."

397
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,565
And there's gonna be
music playin'.

398
00:38:23,631 --> 00:38:26,478
It's like music
I never heard before.

399
00:38:29,262 --> 00:38:31,979
And then the car's gonna start up,

400
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:36,586
and it's gonna drive slowly
towards the city, very slowly.

401
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:39,589
It's gonna be beautiful, man.

402
00:38:39,663 --> 00:38:41,736
Yes.

403
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,599
- You're such an asshole.
- What?

404
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:52,265
- You're an asshole.
- Yeah, why am I an asshole, huh?

405
00:38:52,335 --> 00:38:54,572
Why am I an asshole?

406
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,316
'Cause you imagine
all this insane shit...

407
00:38:58,383 --> 00:39:02,758
like you were...
Bebe Rebozo or something.

408
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:06,247
Yeah?
Who's Bebe Rebozo?

409
00:39:08,752 --> 00:39:10,661
Zack, who's Bebe Rebozo?

410
00:39:16,016 --> 00:39:17,925
What'd you do on the outside?

411
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,855
You were a garbage man, right?

412
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:25,132
I wasn't no garbage man.

413
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,109
Well, what'd you do then?

414
00:39:29,712 --> 00:39:31,851
- I was a D.J.
- What?

415
00:39:33,648 --> 00:39:35,787
- I was a D.J.
- A music D.J.?

416
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,200
- Yeah.
- Nah, man. I don't believe it. Really?

417
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:43,142
What station? I listen to the radio.
I must have heard you.

418
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,044
Shit. WYLD.

419
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,328
- Lee Baby Simms.
- You're Lee Baby Simms?

420
00:39:52,401 --> 00:39:54,605
- No.
- Yeah.

421
00:39:54,673 --> 00:39:57,575
- You heard of me?
- Nope.

422
00:39:57,649 --> 00:40:00,300
- Fuck you.

423
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:03,183
Ah, I can't believe it.
I got a D.J. In here with me?

424
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:05,103
I think that's unbelievable, man.

425
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:08,103
Why don't you do, like,
a little, you know...

426
00:40:08,177 --> 00:40:10,349
a thing, you know, a talk?

427
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:13,450
I don't feel like it.

428
00:40:13,521 --> 00:40:17,231
Come on, man.
Do, you know, do the weather or something.

429
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:24,335
Man, what's it like outside?
Why don't you tell me that?

430
00:40:24,402 --> 00:40:26,791
- Cold.
- What else? Come on,
tell me some stuff, you know?

431
00:40:26,866 --> 00:40:31,022
Go ahead, do the thing.
Come on. Go.

432
00:40:32,562 --> 00:40:34,601
All right. Okay.

433
00:40:34,673 --> 00:40:37,194
All right.

434
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,309
Let's see, um,

435
00:40:43,378 --> 00:40:45,287
okay.

436
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:49,133
"Well, we got about 12 below
the big red line.

437
00:40:49,202 --> 00:40:53,359
"Slick icy road conditions
out there tonight, Bob. You betcha.

438
00:40:53,426 --> 00:40:55,979
"All you holiday travelers beware.

439
00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:00,490
"Looks like we got
about a four-car pileup
out there on the airline highway.

to our mobile unit now.

441
00:41:02,482 --> 00:41:05,450
Chip, what does it
look like out there to you."
It was that type of thing.

442
00:41:05,523 --> 00:41:07,978
- Come on, do some more. That was cool.
- Weather and bullshit.

443
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:11,247
- Do some more. Come on.
- Nah.

444
00:41:11,314 --> 00:41:13,584
Do some more.

445
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:15,506
All right, okay.

446
00:41:16,755 --> 00:41:18,860
Let's see.

447
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:22,575
All right. Uh...

448
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:26,635
Uh... okay.

Man, what is wrong with you?

466
00:42:26,581 --> 00:42:29,298
It's like pulling teeth tryin' to get you
to talk, and you're a fuckin' D.J.

He don't even speak no English.

478

Homicidal son of a bitch
says he's Italian.

479
00:44:05,495 --> 00:44:08,343
And why don't you take a flying fuck?

480
00:45:15,545 --> 00:45:19,986
If looks can kill, I am dead now.

I "ham" Roberto.

Roberto. Call me Bob.
The same.

483
00:46:24,378 --> 00:46:27,248
No good here... for me.

484
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:33,976
Is, uh... Is...

Excuse me.
Excuse me.

Excuse me.

488
00:46:51,452 --> 00:46:54,103
Not enough room to swing a cat.

489
00:46:56,763 --> 00:46:58,673
Cat. The animal.

490
00:47:11,388 --> 00:47:13,330
- Excuse me, Jack...
- Zack!

491
00:47:13,404 --> 00:47:18,008
Zack. I have the "hicc-outs."
Do you have some cigarette?

492
00:47:18,076 --> 00:47:19,986
- No.

493
00:47:21,628 --> 00:47:24,083
- No!
- No. I understand.

Thank you.

495
00:47:32,348 --> 00:47:35,250
Do you have, uh, Zack, some cigarette?

496
00:47:36,413 --> 00:47:38,300
I'm Jack.
Get it straight.

497
00:47:38,364 --> 00:47:40,437
Yes. Got it straight.

498
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:48,949
But do you have some cigarette?

499
00:47:49,021 --> 00:47:51,257
Cigarettes won't help with hiccups.
Not in this country.

500
00:47:51,325 --> 00:47:55,319
Me, yes, uh, c-c-cigarette help me...

501
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:58,007

when I have the hicc-outs.

- Don't ask me again.
- Thank you.

503
00:48:14,589 --> 00:48:19,892
Do you have, uh, mm...
J-Jack...

504
00:48:19,966 --> 00:48:22,519
Jack, do you have some fire?

505
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,499
- No.

506
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,811
- Excuse me, Jack, do... Zack!
- Zack!

507
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:38,555
- I'm Zack. He's Jack. I'm Zack.
- Zack.

508
00:48:38,622 --> 00:48:41,272
Do you have some fire?

509
00:48:41,342 --> 00:48:45,085
No. Matches aren't allowed here.

510
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:47,932
Do you understand?

511
00:48:47,998 --> 00:48:49,908
Yes.
Yes, I see.

512
00:48:53,534 --> 00:48:55,389
I see.

513
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:14,872
Do you like Walt Whitman?

514
00:49:14,943 --> 00:49:19,002
Yes, I like Walt Whitman very much.
Leaves of "Glass."

515
00:49:20,703 --> 00:49:22,558
What?

516
00:49:22,624 --> 00:49:25,406
Nothing. I said,
"Do you like Walt Whitman?"

517
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:34,909
- Walt Whitman?
- Yes. I like Walt Whitman very much.

518
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,910
Very good, the Leaves of "Glass."

519
00:49:37,984 --> 00:49:39,959
Leaves of "Glass."

520
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:50,325
Walt Whitman.

521
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,110
Walt Whitman.

522
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:29,206
Zaaa-ta.

523
00:50:36,098 --> 00:50:39,261
- What the hell are you doin'?

524
00:51:01,506 --> 00:51:04,855
- Bob? Bob?
- Yes?

525
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:06,839
What the hell are you doin'?

526
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:13,819
I make "hay" window.
Huh?

527
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:15,800
That's good, Bob.

528
00:51:17,794 --> 00:51:21,755
Excuse me. Do you say
in English, "I look "hat" the window,"

529
00:51:21,826 --> 00:51:25,982
or do you say in English,
"I look "hout" the window"?

530
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:29,760
Well, in this case, Bob, I'm afraid
you gotta say, "I look at the window."

531
00:51:52,611 --> 00:51:57,313
So, uh, Za... Jack.
Jack, why-why are you put in this place?

532
00:51:58,787 --> 00:52:01,308
I don't know, Bob. It was, like,
voodoo or something, you know?

533
00:52:03,523 --> 00:52:07,385
I was framed. I'm completely
innocent. You understand?

534
00:52:07,459 --> 00:52:10,754
- Yes. You are innocent man. I understand.
- Yeah.

535
00:52:14,404 --> 00:52:18,113
And you, my friend, Zack,
why are you put in this prison?

536
00:52:20,452 --> 00:52:22,361
I was set up, Bob.

537
00:52:24,131 --> 00:52:26,204
- Just likeJack.
- Mm.

538
00:52:29,924 --> 00:52:32,859
- I "ham" an innocent man.

539
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:39,293
I see.
You too are an innocent man.

540
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:48,608
So, Bob,
for why are you in this prison put?

541
00:52:49,893 --> 00:52:52,926
Me? I killed "hay" man.

542
00:53:10,213 --> 00:53:12,155
You killed a man, huh?

543
00:53:18,885 --> 00:53:21,089
What'd you do that for, Bob?

544
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:24,474
- The guy didn't like Walt Whitman?

545
00:53:28,165 --> 00:53:31,264
I never asked this man
if he liked Walt Whitman.

546
00:53:36,614 --> 00:53:39,265
Come on, Bob.
Why'd you kill a man?

547
00:53:40,581 --> 00:53:45,022
I, uh... We-We was, uh,
playing-a card.

548
00:53:45,094 --> 00:53:49,120
No? Table. I have no money,
but I am a cheater.

549
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,197
- Yeah?
- Very good.

550
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,783
But I don't know...
I don't know why they...

551
00:53:54,854 --> 00:53:58,531
they notice after a while
l-l-l-I am a cheater.

552
00:53:58,598 --> 00:54:01,086
- It's strange, really. I'm a good cheater.

553
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:05,948
They notice, and I run, run away,
and they run back me, yes.

554
00:54:06,023 --> 00:54:10,300
In another room with the billiard,
pool... the pool, no?

555
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,579
There. And, uh, and, uh...

556
00:54:12,647 --> 00:54:14,752
But I was very fast, very speedy.

557
00:54:14,823 --> 00:54:18,652
And they for stop me,
take a ball... take ball... many ball.

558
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:22,917
Very "closed."
Ta! Ta! Ta!

559
00:54:22,983 --> 00:54:26,944
And l... You...
You throw ball against me,

560
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:28,989
I throw ball against you, no?

561
00:54:29,063 --> 00:54:33,984
I take one ball... a number eight.
Very good ball. Black ball.

562
00:54:34,055 --> 00:54:36,444
Ta! Tum! Ta!

563
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:38,886
In the ground.
First stroke. Ha!

564
00:54:40,423 --> 00:54:43,140
Dead. Very big man.

565
00:54:43,207 --> 00:54:45,444
On the ground.
First stroke.

566
00:54:45,511 --> 00:54:49,821
Is that true, Bob?
This is a true story?

567
00:54:49,896 --> 00:54:53,245
- True story? Yeah, true story.
- Yeah.

568
00:54:55,528 --> 00:55:00,317
True story.
Very true story.

569
00:55:00,392 --> 00:55:03,741
On the ground, the first stroke.

570
00:55:03,816 --> 00:55:07,329
You throw the ball against me?

571
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,309
I throw ball against you.

572
00:55:10,856 --> 00:55:14,533
But I "ham" no criminal.
I "ham" a good egg.

573
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,183
I am a good egg. Jesus.

574
00:55:21,256 --> 00:55:24,639
Yes. I "ham" a good egg.

575
00:55:24,712 --> 00:55:28,541
Yes. We are.
We are a good egg.

576
00:55:30,184 --> 00:55:32,737
- My friends.
- Get off.

577
00:55:52,038 --> 00:55:54,110
Yes.

578
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:03,041
- Watch out for Bob. He may be cheating.

579
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,598
Is no joke.
Look where I am.

580
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:07,579
Is no funny.

581
00:56:11,078 --> 00:56:13,631
- I have two pair. Two pair.
- What?

582
00:56:15,878 --> 00:56:17,951
- What do you got?
- Nothing.

583
00:56:18,023 --> 00:56:20,608
- Of course.
- Nothing.

584
00:56:20,678 --> 00:56:22,020
Ahhh-ha.

585
00:56:24,935 --> 00:56:28,764
- Heh. What is, "Ahhh-ha?"
- Screaming.

586
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:32,668
Screaming. Ahhh.

587
00:56:32,742 --> 00:56:35,459
Screaming? Screaming?
Ah, screaming.

588
00:56:35,526 --> 00:56:38,876
Screaming. One moment.
I have screaming.

589
00:56:38,951 --> 00:56:41,340
Eh, screaming.

590
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:44,450
Screaming. Ecco.

591
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:49,472
I scream-a, you scream-a,
we all scream-a for ice cream-a.

592
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:54,784
I scream-a, you scream-a,
we all scream-a for ice cream-a.

593
00:56:54,855 --> 00:56:57,244
You understand?

594
00:56:57,319 --> 00:57:01,597
I scream-a, you scream-a,
we all scream-a for ice cream-a.

595
00:57:01,672 --> 00:57:05,763
I scream-a, you scream-a,

596
00:57:05,832 --> 00:57:10,207
I scream-a, you scream-a,

597
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,858
I scream, you scream,

00:57:13,927 --> 00:57:17,506

600
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,196
I scream, you scream,

601
00:57:24,264 --> 00:57:27,134
I scream, you scream,

602
00:57:27,209 --> 00:57:30,591
I scream, you scream,
we all scream for ice cream.

603
00:57:30,664 --> 00:57:33,861
I scream, you scream,
we all scream for ice cream.

604
00:57:33,929 --> 00:57:37,311
I scream, you scream,
we all scream for ice cream.

605
00:57:37,384 --> 00:57:40,897
I scream, you scream,
we all scream for ice cream.

606
00:57:40,968 --> 00:57:44,351
- I scream, you scream,
we all scream for ice cream.

607
00:57:44,425 --> 00:57:47,741
I scream, you scream,
we all scream for ice cream.

608
00:57:47,817 --> 00:57:51,330
I scream, you scream,
we all scream for ice cream.

609
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:54,368
I scream, you scream,
we all scream for ice cream.

610
00:57:54,441 --> 00:57:58,020
I scream, we all scream,
we all scream for ice cream.

611
00:58:04,298 --> 00:58:07,647
I scream, you scream,
we all scream for ice cream.

612
00:58:22,601 --> 00:58:24,990
- Keep it down in here too.
- We all scream for ice cream.

613
00:58:25,065 --> 00:58:27,935
- I scream, you scream...
- Put a lid on it.

614
00:58:28,009 --> 00:58:29,919
- Put a lid on it.
- All right, quiet!

615
00:58:29,994 --> 00:58:32,711
Kill the noise.
Let's go. Kill the noise.

616
00:59:06,891 --> 00:59:11,681
Today, today in the yard,
I make a discovery. Very interesting.

617
00:59:15,115 --> 00:59:19,752
And I think, uh, I think
a film I have seen in Italy.

618
00:59:19,819 --> 00:59:22,372
An American film,
very good, lots of action.

619
00:59:25,675 --> 00:59:29,352
"Hit" was a prison film.

620
00:59:29,419 --> 00:59:32,932
When, uh, with...

621
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:36,833
H-how do you say
in English, when, uh...

622
00:59:36,908 --> 00:59:39,723
when the man go out
of the prison, running away?

623
00:59:39,788 --> 00:59:44,905
- Escape. Escape.
- What? Escape.

624
00:59:44,972 --> 00:59:47,525
Escape. Yes, escape.

625
00:59:49,547 --> 00:59:52,581
Today in the yard,
I discover a way.

626
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:00,769
Bob, there's no way you could escape
from the yard. There's no way.

627
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,108
Forget it.

628
01:00:04,172 --> 01:00:06,561
Yes. Yes.

629
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:10,629
Not from the yard.
To the yard.

630
01:00:17,036 --> 01:00:20,866
If there was a way to get out of here,
we would know about it.

631
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:23,177
It's your turn.

632
01:00:26,092 --> 01:00:29,126
Come on, Bob.
It's no time for a joke.

633
01:00:29,197 --> 01:00:31,499
"Come on, Bob.
It's no time for a joke?"

634
01:00:31,565 --> 01:00:33,507
But I am no joke.

635
01:00:33,581 --> 01:00:35,970
I am very serious.

636
01:00:39,341 --> 01:00:41,730
I am sure.

637
01:00:50,285 --> 01:00:52,674
Here they come.

638
01:00:57,294 --> 01:00:59,181
Okay, you two.

639
01:00:59,245 --> 01:01:01,962
Time for your walk.

640
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:04,135
Not you, shorty.
It ain't your turn.

641
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:06,344
Come on. Let's go.

642
01:01:07,886 --> 01:01:11,082
But I no go for four days!
I no go. I missed my turn.

643
01:01:13,486 --> 01:01:15,657
Really, no joke.
I "ham" a good egg.

644
01:01:15,726 --> 01:01:18,574
I no go for four days.
Four days. I missed my turn.

645
01:01:18,638 --> 01:01:20,874
All right, all right,
Leonardo Da Vinci. Come on.

646
01:01:20,942 --> 01:01:22,797
Grazie, grazie.

647
01:02:20,464 --> 01:02:24,774
We... We have escaped
like in the American movies.

648
01:02:29,552 --> 01:02:34,670
- Hey. Shh!

649
01:02:34,736 --> 01:02:37,453
Yeah, man.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire.

650
01:03:01,393 --> 01:03:03,248
We could actually make it.

651
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:07,309
- We gotta cross the river.

652
01:03:07,377 --> 01:03:10,890
It's our only chance
of losing the scent of the dogs.

653
01:03:10,961 --> 01:03:13,350
- Ah, yeah, yeah. This part I remember.

654
01:03:13,425 --> 01:03:16,938
Shut up.

655
01:03:17,009 --> 01:03:19,082
But I cannot swim.

656
01:03:20,146 --> 01:03:22,218
Oh, man.

657
01:03:22,289 --> 01:03:24,362
Shit!

658
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:28,263
We gotta do it.
We gotta cross.

659
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:33,127
Maybe Mark Twain will come by
and pick you up in a steamboat.

660
01:03:33,201 --> 01:03:37,358
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

661
01:03:37,426 --> 01:03:41,834
My-My friends, wait!
No time for a joke. I cannot swim.

662
01:03:41,906 --> 01:03:46,216
Jack and Zack, my friends.
I cannot swim!

663
01:04:51,028 --> 01:04:54,705
Arregg the dogs! Arregg the dogs!
Don't shoot me, please.

664
01:04:57,492 --> 01:05:00,841
Jack, my friend. Jack...

665
01:05:20,308 --> 01:05:22,697
He sleeps.

666
01:05:24,852 --> 01:05:27,088
Well,
I ain't going to sleep around here.

667
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,097
This whole place
is crawling with alligators.

668
01:05:34,164 --> 01:05:37,361
Big ones.

669
01:05:37,429 --> 01:05:42,732
Snakes of all kinds.
You got water moccasins,

670
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:48,075
copperheads, diamondbacks,
you name it, man.

671
01:05:48,149 --> 01:05:50,058
There's all kinds
of shit out there.

672
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:57,427
I say we rest here for a while,
then we keep moving until daybreak.

673
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:04,682
How big the alligators are?

674
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:11,987
Uh, 12, maybe 15 feet long.

675
01:06:14,742 --> 01:06:17,611
Pretty near three times
your size, Bob.

676
01:06:26,742 --> 01:06:30,059
Red ants.

677
01:06:30,134 --> 01:06:32,687
They can eat an entire family
in a half an hour.

678
01:06:36,214 --> 01:06:38,603
My family in half an hour?!

679
01:07:14,615 --> 01:07:16,525
What's wrong, Bob?

680
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:19,796
I have lost my book of English.

681
01:07:19,863 --> 01:07:22,252
All I ever knowed is there.

682
01:07:22,327 --> 01:07:25,676
Come on, man.
You're lucky to even be here.

683
01:07:28,216 --> 01:07:31,565
I am lucky to even be here.

684
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:22,359
Matches.

685
01:09:32,379 --> 01:09:34,452
Man, this looks a little too familiar.

686
01:09:39,099 --> 01:09:42,296
I gotta get away
from you guys.

687
01:09:42,363 --> 01:09:45,746
Yeah, that would be nice.

688
01:09:45,819 --> 01:09:48,787
The only problem is
we don't know where the hell we are.

689
01:09:53,595 --> 01:09:55,668
All right, look.

690
01:09:55,739 --> 01:09:57,594
I say we hole up here
for the night...

691
01:10:00,443 --> 01:10:02,298
and tomorrow
we leave in the boat.

692
01:10:02,363 --> 01:10:04,916
Hey, man, who the fuck
put you in charge?

693
01:10:04,987 --> 01:10:09,526
I put myself in charge,
because you can't keep it together.

694
01:10:09,596 --> 01:10:11,985
Aw, man.

695
01:10:13,467 --> 01:10:16,184
- The guy's a nut job.
- Fuck you.

696
01:10:16,251 --> 01:10:18,139
My job?

697
01:10:19,644 --> 01:10:23,419
I think we should go to Mississippi,
'cause that's the closest border.

698
01:10:23,484 --> 01:10:27,445
I, I, I would like
to go to west, to Texas.

699
01:10:27,516 --> 01:10:32,185
- No. No.
- A strange country I have seen
in many beautiful films.

700
01:10:32,253 --> 01:10:35,798
That's insane. If we go to Mississippi,
we get caught, we could get a retrial.

701
01:10:35,868 --> 01:10:37,723
If we go to Texas,
we get caught, we're fucked.

702
01:10:37,788 --> 01:10:39,643
Who told you that?

703
01:10:39,708 --> 01:10:42,458
My lawyer told me that
when I was gonna skip bond.

704
01:10:42,524 --> 01:10:44,761
Your lawyer... bunch of bullshit.

705
01:10:44,829 --> 01:10:48,658
Texas, ragazzi.
Very good in Texas.

706
01:10:48,732 --> 01:10:51,121
Cool, man. You go to Texas.
You go to Mars, for all I care.

707
01:10:51,197 --> 01:10:53,685
Just leave me alone, all right?

708
01:10:53,757 --> 01:10:59,354
Look, we're all staying together
till we find out where the hell we are.

709
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:04,210
Right, Lieutenant.
Cool, cool. Yeah.

710
01:11:04,285 --> 01:11:06,522
Hey, would you mind?

711
01:11:06,589 --> 01:11:10,419
Scram.
Go, scram. Move.

712
01:11:23,005 --> 01:11:25,394
Zack, do you like Robert Frost?

713
01:11:27,774 --> 01:11:30,327
Not this again.

714
01:11:45,726 --> 01:11:49,981
A Road Less Traveled by Bob Frost.

715
01:11:50,046 --> 01:11:53,243
He was a very cynical man.

716
01:11:55,998 --> 01:12:00,308
Robert Frost, in Italian?

717
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:03,895
Yes. I have read only
your poets in Italian.

718
01:12:08,031 --> 01:12:09,940
Bob Frost.

719
01:12:16,191 --> 01:12:19,540
Bob Frost.

720
01:12:27,967 --> 01:12:30,039
In Italian.

721
01:13:45,345 --> 01:13:48,923
Be careful, Jack! Watch out the trees.

722
01:13:48,993 --> 01:13:51,546
The trees, a lot of trees.

723
01:13:51,617 --> 01:13:55,196
- Be careful.
- Come on, shift.

724
01:13:55,266 --> 01:13:59,259
- Come on, shift!
- Look out! Another trees.

725
01:14:02,881 --> 01:14:05,915
Dangerous.
Watch out, I cannot swim.

726
01:14:10,562 --> 01:14:14,107
Be careful!

727
01:14:35,395 --> 01:14:38,264
Well, which way now?

728
01:14:41,986 --> 01:14:43,896
Man, haven't we been here before?

729
01:14:46,787 --> 01:14:50,616
Seems like we passed
this fork hours ago.

730
01:14:50,691 --> 01:14:55,164
Man, it all looks the same to me.
I really can't tell.

731
01:14:55,235 --> 01:14:59,708
We've been goin' around in circles, Jack.

732
01:15:04,835 --> 01:15:09,505
Ragazzi! The boat! The boat!
The boat is finished.

733
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:12,670
- There's water in the boat.
- Bail! Bail!

734
01:15:12,739 --> 01:15:15,160
- Go in the land! Go in the land!
- Move your leg.

735
01:15:15,235 --> 01:15:17,886
- No!
- Move your leg.

736
01:15:47,716 --> 01:15:50,269
Well, I don't know
which way to go now.

737
01:15:56,037 --> 01:15:59,233
- What do you think, Jack?
- How the fuck should I know?

738
01:16:03,717 --> 01:16:06,587
Yeah, well,
whatever you say, Jack.

739
01:16:33,222 --> 01:16:36,037
Hey, where is he?

740
01:16:36,102 --> 01:16:39,615
- What?
- Where's Bob?

741
01:16:39,686 --> 01:16:41,595
I don't know.

742
01:16:42,854 --> 01:16:45,407
He said something about food.

743
01:16:46,981 --> 01:16:49,698
- Maybe the alligators got him.
- Hey, man, don't say that.

744
01:16:53,062 --> 01:16:55,451
You know, we could
starve to death out here.

745
01:16:57,926 --> 01:17:02,399
Aah, nah. This swamp can't
go on forever, man.

746
01:17:04,582 --> 01:17:07,452
- We'll find something.
- Man, he's leading us the wrong way.

747
01:17:12,902 --> 01:17:15,936
Who, Bob?

748
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:18,079
He ain't leading us.

749
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:21,347
Hey, man, you don't seem
to think I see what's going on.

750
01:17:21,415 --> 01:17:26,368
You're leadin' us around in circles.
I'm not blind to this. You're fuckin' us up.

751
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:28,805
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

752
01:17:28,871 --> 01:17:32,864
That's right, man.
We're just gonna tire you out...

753
01:17:32,935 --> 01:17:35,008
then we're going to
move in for the kill.

754
01:17:35,079 --> 01:17:36,933
Then we're gonna have
Jack Romano for dinner.

755
01:17:36,999 --> 01:17:39,649
Yeah, is that right,
you fuckin' idiot?

756
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:41,956
C'mon! C'mon.

757
01:17:43,047 --> 01:17:45,436
C'mon, man.

758
01:17:48,104 --> 01:17:51,781
Stop! Stop, my friends!
Stop the fight! Stop!

759
01:17:51,848 --> 01:17:54,597
My friends, stop! Stop.

760
01:17:54,664 --> 01:17:58,177
I have catched the rabbit... dinner.
For dinner.

761
01:17:58,248 --> 01:18:01,030
Huh?

762
01:18:01,095 --> 01:18:06,365
Fuck, man. I'm goin' off by myself.
I'm better off alone. Fuck.

763
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:11,077
- S'all right with me, man.
- A rabbit. Very difficult to catch rabbit.

764
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:14,625
- Every man for himself.
- Zack! Jack!

765
01:18:14,696 --> 01:18:19,333
I run half an hour for this rabbit...
very cunning rabbit.

766
01:18:28,456 --> 01:18:30,693
Well, it's 46 degrees.

767
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:39,202
Slight breeze blowing
through some of our cypress trees...

768
01:18:39,273 --> 01:18:43,746
that are blending in with
a lot of the smaller fir trees in the area.

769
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:51,074
Vegetation, well, I'd say offhand...

770
01:18:51,145 --> 01:18:53,862
dates back to the Mesozoic period...

771
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:59,363
the Tigris-Euphrates River Valley,
the cradle of civilization.

772
01:19:02,634 --> 01:19:05,187
Guy's a fuckin' asshole, man.
Shit.

773
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:10,659
I'm fuckin' starvin' to death.

774
01:19:10,729 --> 01:19:15,519
Man, my thing was cool, boy,
you know. I had my things goin', you know.

775
01:19:15,593 --> 01:19:20,961
My last walk out was like,
"Hey, L.C., how you doin', man?"

776
01:19:21,033 --> 01:19:25,987
Ohh... I'm sorry, baby. I didn't know
it was gonna be like that, man.

777
01:19:27,242 --> 01:19:30,820
Jack, Zack?
Zack, Jack?

778
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:33,443
Jack?

779
01:19:33,514 --> 01:19:36,231
Why do you leave me alone?

780
01:19:36,298 --> 01:19:39,015
There is a very good...
very good rabbit.

781
01:19:39,082 --> 01:19:42,759
I know a very good way to cook it.

782
01:19:42,826 --> 01:19:47,169
My-My mother teached me.
My mother, Isolina.

783
01:19:47,243 --> 01:19:50,112
The name of my mother.
With rosemarino,

784
01:19:50,186 --> 01:19:53,033
rosemarino, olive oil, garlic...

785
01:19:53,099 --> 01:19:56,328
and other secrets of the Isolina.

786
01:19:59,434 --> 01:20:04,737
We're waiting right now for a check
on our general barometric pressure.

787
01:20:06,923 --> 01:20:10,752
Then it's back to more music
with the Lee Baby Simms Show.

788
01:20:17,323 --> 01:20:19,876
Didn't I tell that creep,
"She's not fuckin' available."

789
01:20:19,947 --> 01:20:22,052
- Right?

790
01:20:22,123 --> 01:20:25,319
- Shut up!

791
01:20:26,635 --> 01:20:30,530
Before, she is very kind
with the rabbit.

792
01:20:30,604 --> 01:20:34,379
She call the rabbit,
"Good rabbit. I like this little rabbit.

793
01:20:34,444 --> 01:20:37,313
The eyes of the ra...Ta!

794
01:20:37,387 --> 01:20:40,551
Suddenly, the rabbit dead.

795
01:20:40,619 --> 01:20:45,092
Very strange mother, my mother.
Very strange, yes.

796
01:20:45,163 --> 01:20:49,800
My father, no. He's very strong,
but with the rabbit he is afraid.

797
01:20:49,868 --> 01:20:52,486
My sister... I have one mother
and three sisters.

798
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:54,411
Bruna, Albertina, e Anna.

799
01:20:56,108 --> 01:20:59,851
I had a picture of my mother
in my room,

800
01:20:59,916 --> 01:21:05,186
smiling with the rabbit in her hand
and the other, so... Ha, ta.

801
01:21:06,412 --> 01:21:09,729
Sometime l-I dream
of my mother that call me,

802
01:21:09,805 --> 01:21:13,482
"Robertino, vieni qua.
Robertino, come on."

803
01:21:13,549 --> 01:21:16,167
"No, I don't want."
"Come on. Come on."

804
01:21:16,236 --> 01:21:20,492
Ta! Una bota in my neck.
"I am not rabbit." "Yes, you are."

805
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:26,882
My mother...
very strange mother.

806
01:21:26,957 --> 01:21:29,510
But I love my mother.

807
01:21:29,581 --> 01:21:33,094
Isolina, and my father, Gigi,
and my sisters Bruna, Albertina, e Anna.

808
01:21:34,861 --> 01:21:38,058
My family and my rabbit.

809
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:42,827
And I love to catch, to dream...

810
01:21:45,645 --> 01:21:48,034
- What is?

811
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:51,939
What? Zack! Heh.
Jack! Jack and Zack!

812
01:21:52,013 --> 01:21:54,086
I knew! Come on. Come on.

813
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:56,492
To eat the animal
I have catched.

814
01:21:56,557 --> 01:22:00,714
The rabbit. I run half an hour
behind it. Very good.

815
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:04,044
Come on. Jack, come on.

816
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:07,372
Sit down.
I am glad.

817
01:22:07,438 --> 01:22:10,787
Sit down, the fire.
Yes. Yes, taste it.

818
01:22:10,862 --> 01:22:14,375
Yes, taste it.
Taste, Zack, taste. Eh?

819
01:22:14,446 --> 01:22:18,504
Taste. In a moment.

820
01:22:18,574 --> 01:22:22,884
Yeah. Yeah.

821
01:22:22,958 --> 01:22:27,912
Yeah? Of course, I haven't
garlic, rosemarino...

822
01:22:27,982 --> 01:22:30,851
very important... and olive oil,
but is good, eh?

823
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,108
- It's disgusting, Bob.
- Yes.

824
01:22:37,263 --> 01:22:41,092
- Bob, it tastes like a tire.
- Yeah. I know, is very good.

825
01:23:28,368 --> 01:23:30,604
The road.

826
01:23:38,417 --> 01:23:42,727
Civilization.

827
01:23:43,921 --> 01:23:47,914
Well, which way now, Jack?

828
01:23:56,368 --> 01:23:59,238
Well, I say we go that way.

829
01:23:59,313 --> 01:24:02,826
- I agree.
- Aye, aye, Lieutenant.

830
01:24:35,346 --> 01:24:40,463
It's a mirage.
You think we're imagining this?

831
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:44,686
Well, if we are,
I could use some imaginary pie and coffee.

832
01:24:49,138 --> 01:24:52,487
One of us should go in there alone,
in case the law is inside.

833
01:24:57,298 --> 01:24:59,338
All right, Bob.

834
01:24:59,634 --> 01:25:04,391
I want you to go in there first.
Make sure everything's safe.

835
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:08,622
If everything's all right,
you come back out and tell us.

836
01:25:08,691 --> 01:25:12,040
- You understand me?
- I understand. I "ham" ready.

837
01:25:12,114 --> 01:25:16,588
Okay. Hey, Bob,
we'll be right here.

838
01:25:16,659 --> 01:25:19,048
- Right here waiting.
- Yes.

839
01:25:43,668 --> 01:25:46,701
Jesus, he walked right in there
like an idiot.

840
01:25:49,491 --> 01:25:52,208
Let's hide over here.

841
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:18,729
- Hey.

842
01:26:22,069 --> 01:26:24,458
How long was I asleep?

843
01:26:27,317 --> 01:26:30,186
Let's check it out,

844
01:26:30,261 --> 01:26:34,255
I'm starving to death
and I'm freezing, all right?

845
01:26:34,325 --> 01:26:37,903
All right.
Let's move slow.

846
01:26:37,973 --> 01:26:42,129
Just look in the window.
I'll be right behind you.

847
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,750
Oh, thanks.

848
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:28,719
Holy Toledo.
Can you believe this?

849
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:31,179
He's from outer space.

850
01:27:58,519 --> 01:28:01,618
Oh! My friends!

851
01:28:01,687 --> 01:28:03,923
What the hell's goin' on here, Bob?

852
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:05,845
Come on. Come on.
Is wonderful.

853
01:28:05,911 --> 01:28:11,028
Look, eh, wine, food.
Come on. Come on.

854
01:28:11,095 --> 01:28:13,648
Sit down, please.
Sit down here, Jack, Zack.

855
01:28:16,664 --> 01:28:20,755
Sit down. Sit down.
Is wonderful, look.

856
01:28:20,823 --> 01:28:25,777
My friends. I must tell us some news.

857
01:28:27,543 --> 01:28:30,805
I "ham" in love.
This is Nicoletta.

858
01:28:30,871 --> 01:28:33,173
- Hi. How you doing?
- Hello.

859
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:36,557
- Fine, thank you.
- Eat, please.

860
01:28:36,631 --> 01:28:39,282
Thank you.

861
01:28:39,352 --> 01:28:42,287
Eat.

862
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:47,477
- She is from Italy too.
- Yes, I'm from Italy.

863
01:28:47,545 --> 01:28:50,000
- Do you know, I am from Cesena?
- Cesena.

864
01:28:50,072 --> 01:28:52,144
- You know Cesena?
- No. No?

865
01:28:52,216 --> 01:28:56,853
And this place was given to me
as a present from my Uncle Luigi.

866
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,084
- What happened to your Uncle Luigi?

867
01:29:00,152 --> 01:29:02,422
- He died.

868
01:29:02,489 --> 01:29:05,009
You laugh. He died.

869
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:06,990
What was he like?

870
01:29:07,064 --> 01:29:09,137
- He was wonderful. Yes.

871
01:29:09,209 --> 01:29:13,879
He won this place playing cards,
and he was afraid to lose it again,

872
01:29:13,945 --> 01:29:16,498
so he gave me like a present.

873
01:29:16,569 --> 01:29:20,049
But I didn't know
what to do with this.

874
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:22,674
And one day...

875
01:29:22,745 --> 01:29:26,226
it was a very particular day...

876
01:29:26,297 --> 01:29:30,192
like out of the blue,
my boyfriend left me.

877
01:29:30,265 --> 01:29:32,982
- Aw.
- Yes. It was my birthday.

878
01:29:33,049 --> 01:29:34,478
- Aw.
- Yes.

879
01:29:34,553 --> 01:29:36,441
And Uncle Luigi died.

880
01:29:36,506 --> 01:29:38,361
- Oh, no.
- All in the same day.

881
01:29:38,426 --> 01:29:43,412
So in the same day, I left Italy
and I come to live here.

882
01:29:43,481 --> 01:29:48,118
Yes. Yes. Yes.

883
01:29:48,185 --> 01:29:50,902
And now I have falled
in love, at last.

884
01:29:52,985 --> 01:29:55,255
I have finded my new home.

885
01:29:55,322 --> 01:29:58,355
She has asked to me
if I stay here...

886
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:01,743
to live together with her
forever and ever.

887
01:30:01,818 --> 01:30:04,688
- Like in a book for children.
- Yes.

888
01:30:04,762 --> 01:30:06,834
No.

889
01:30:14,043 --> 01:30:17,392
Well, how did you learn
how to speak English?

890
01:30:17,466 --> 01:30:19,768
Oh, yes. I speak pretty well,

891
01:30:19,834 --> 01:30:22,704
but I know nothing
about English for restaurant.

892
01:30:22,779 --> 01:30:25,845
Like food, good plate, nice dish...

893
01:30:25,915 --> 01:30:28,533
these word I don't know.

894
01:30:28,602 --> 01:30:31,951
Well, Bob should come in handy there.
He speaks good restaurant English.

895
01:30:32,027 --> 01:30:35,061
- Yes.
- Yes, my killer.

896
01:30:46,588 --> 01:30:49,305
Well, that's just great, Bob.

897
01:30:49,371 --> 01:30:52,567
Yeah, congratulations.
Do you know where we are?

898
01:30:52,635 --> 01:30:55,505
- Louisiana.
- No, I know Louisiana, but...

899
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:58,896
Near the border ofTexas.

900
01:30:58,971 --> 01:31:02,801
Ah! You see?
Texas. I knew this, eh?

901
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:07,665
Texas... near.
Remember?

902
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:09,976
- Well, I propose a toast.
- Yes, thank you.

903
01:31:10,043 --> 01:31:13,459
- To Bob and Nicoletta.

904
01:31:13,532 --> 01:31:17,361
- Oh, my friends. Thank you.
- Thank you.

905
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:39,410
Ah, you look good
in my Uncle Luigi clothes.

906
01:31:39,485 --> 01:31:41,874
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

907
01:31:47,484 --> 01:31:50,518
Say, uh, you don't have a car
or anything, do you?

908
01:31:50,589 --> 01:31:54,745
Car, no. But I will save to buy one
and learn to drive.

909
01:31:54,813 --> 01:31:57,496
- I've only my bicycle.
- Ah.

910
01:31:57,565 --> 01:32:02,202
But there's a man who brings things
I need from town once a week or so.

911
01:32:08,157 --> 01:32:11,191
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

912
01:32:11,262 --> 01:32:14,131
- More Uncle Luigi clothes.
- Yes.

913
01:32:14,205 --> 01:32:16,594
Very sporty, Jack.

914
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:23,379
So, but you are sure
you must leave today?

915
01:32:23,453 --> 01:32:28,887
Why we cannot stay here
for some times first?

916
01:32:28,957 --> 01:32:31,030
It's too dangerous out there, Bob.

917
01:32:31,102 --> 01:32:33,371
There's probably
an A.P.B. Out on all of us.

918
01:32:33,438 --> 01:32:36,472
Nah, I'm sure
we're gonna make it.

919
01:32:36,542 --> 01:32:40,698
Well, we're gonna
have to keep going.

920
01:32:42,622 --> 01:32:44,859
At least now we know where we are.

921
01:32:44,926 --> 01:32:46,998
And where do you go now?

922
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:51,227
I'll probably head out west.
Out to Los Angeles.

923
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:56,565
And you, my friend, Jack?
Where do you go?

924
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:00,468
Well, if he's going to L.A.,
I'm gonna go east. You know what I mean?

925
01:33:00,542 --> 01:33:03,412
Yes, I know what I mean.

926
01:33:07,903 --> 01:33:10,772
Some music, yeah?

927
01:33:20,479 --> 01:33:26,175
Drip drop, drip drop
Drip drop, drip drop

928
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:29,916
It's raining so hard

929
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:33,366
Looks like it's gonna
rain all night

930
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:39,135
And this is the time
I love for you to hold me tight

931
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:42,428
But I guess
I'll have to accept

932
01:33:42,495 --> 01:33:45,976
The fact that
you are not here

933
01:33:46,048 --> 01:33:51,645
I wish tonight would hurry up
and end, my dear

934
01:33:51,712 --> 01:33:55,869
You're sure
you must leave today? I stay.

935
01:34:04,705 --> 01:34:11,066
This is the time I love
to be holding you tight

936
01:34:11,136 --> 01:34:17,214
I guess I'll just
go crazy at night

937
01:34:17,281 --> 01:34:20,445
- It's raining so hard
- Drip drop, drip drop

938
01:34:20,513 --> 01:34:24,408
- Drip that never ends
- Drip drop, drip drop

939
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:29,751
All of the time
that you were here with me

940
01:34:29,824 --> 01:34:35,738
Counting every drop
About to blow my top

941
01:34:35,809 --> 01:34:42,203
I wish this rain
would hurry up and stop

942
01:34:42,273 --> 01:34:48,154
I've got the blues so bad
I can hardly catch my breath

943
01:34:48,225 --> 01:34:54,335
The harder it rains
the worse it gets

944
01:34:54,401 --> 01:35:00,479
This is the time I love
to be holding you tight

945
01:35:00,545 --> 01:35:05,499
I guess I'll just
go crazy at night

946
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:11,899
Drip drop, drip drop
Drip drop, drip drop

947
01:35:11,970 --> 01:35:15,996
- Drip drop

948
01:35:16,066 --> 01:35:18,619
If you follow this road,

949
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:21,624
you will come to a place
where it becomes two roads.

950
01:35:23,042 --> 01:35:27,963
On the right will go east.
On the left will go west.

951
01:35:28,034 --> 01:35:32,987
Eh, no.
On the right will go west.

952
01:35:33,058 --> 01:35:37,979
Eh, no. I'm not sure.
Anyway there is a sign to tell you.

953
01:35:38,050 --> 01:35:41,117
- It's all right. We'll figure it out.
- It's okay?

954
01:35:41,187 --> 01:35:44,383
- Thanks for everything.
- Yeah. Thank you. Good-bye.

955
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:48,379
- Good-bye. And take care.
- Zack.

956
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:50,687
- Okay, Bob.
- I will.

957
01:35:50,755 --> 01:35:53,057
- Good-bye, Bob.
- Jack.

958
01:35:57,699 --> 01:36:01,212
- Be careful.
- Okay.

959
01:36:12,707 --> 01:36:17,792
- Don't forget to write.
- Bye.

960
01:36:17,859 --> 01:36:20,096
So long.

961
01:36:26,660 --> 01:36:29,049
Wish you were here.

962
01:37:27,397 --> 01:37:31,227
- I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

963
01:37:31,302 --> 01:37:33,691
I don't see a sign
around or anything.

964
01:37:33,765 --> 01:37:36,962
Well, she said the one
to the right goes west.

965
01:37:37,029 --> 01:37:38,884
She said she didn't know.

966
01:37:38,949 --> 01:37:40,804
Look, man, don't matter to me.

967
01:37:40,869 --> 01:37:44,382
You go whichever way you want, right?
And I'll go the other way.

968
01:37:44,453 --> 01:37:47,006
- Yeah, right. All right.
- All right?

969
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:54,462
So, uh...

970
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:58,627
this is how you dressed
before you were in the joint, right?

971
01:37:58,694 --> 01:38:01,411
Sort of garbage man on parade.

972
01:38:04,614 --> 01:38:08,127
You, uh, plannin' on doin'
a little squirrel huntin', Jack?

973
01:38:12,198 --> 01:38:14,271
Yeah.

974
01:38:29,351 --> 01:38:31,740
Okay.

975
01:38:36,903 --> 01:38:39,456
Well...

976
01:38:41,607 --> 01:38:45,120
Good luck with yourself... Zack.

977
01:39:47,336 --> 01:39:50,206
Well, ya play that Tarantella

978
01:39:50,281 --> 01:39:52,583
All the hounds will start to roar

979
01:39:52,649 --> 01:39:57,253
The boys all go to hell
and then the Cubans hit the floor

980
01:39:57,321 --> 01:40:01,991
They drive along the pipeline
They tango till they're sore

981
01:40:02,057 --> 01:40:06,051
They take apart their nightmares
and they leave 'em by the door

982
01:40:06,122 --> 01:40:11,686
Let me fall out of the window
with confetti in my hair

983
01:40:11,753 --> 01:40:15,976
Deal outjacks or better
on a blanket by the stairs

984
01:40:16,041 --> 01:40:20,613
I'll tell you all my secrets
but I lie about my past

985
01:40:20,682 --> 01:40:23,879
And send me off
to bed forevermore

986
01:40:27,466 --> 01:40:29,887
Make sure they play
my theme song

987
01:40:29,962 --> 01:40:32,264
I guess daisies
will have to do

988
01:40:32,330 --> 01:40:36,803
Just get me to New Orleans
and paint shadows on the pews

989
01:40:36,874 --> 01:40:40,769
Turn the spit on that pig
and kick the drum and let me down

990
01:40:40,843 --> 01:40:45,731
Put my clarinet beneath your bed
till I get back in town

991
01:40:45,802 --> 01:40:50,756
Let me fall out of the window
with confetti in my hair

992
01:40:50,827 --> 01:40:55,398
Deal outjacks or better
on a blanket by the stairs

993
01:40:55,467 --> 01:41:00,038
I'll tell you all my secrets
but I lie about my past

994
01:41:00,106 --> 01:41:03,368
So send me off
to bed forevermore

995
01:41:06,795 --> 01:41:11,432
Just make sure she's all in calico
and the color of a doll

996
01:41:11,499 --> 01:41:16,234
Wave the flag on Cadillac day
and a skillet on the wall

997
01:41:16,299 --> 01:41:20,675
Cut me a switch or hold your breath
till the sun goes down

998
01:41:20,747 --> 01:41:25,537
Write my name on the hood
Send me off to another town

999
01:41:25,611 --> 01:41:30,051
Andjust let me fall out of the window
with confetti in my hair

1000
01:41:30,123 --> 01:41:34,913
Deal outjacks or better
on a blanket by the stairs

1001
01:41:34,988 --> 01:41:39,461
I'll tell you all my secrets

01:41:39,532 --> 01:41:43,045

Fall out of the window

1004
01:41:53,644 --> 01:41:58,151
Deal outjacks or better
on a blanket by the stairs

1005
01:41:58,220 --> 01:42:02,792
I'll tell you all my secrets
but I lie about my past

1006
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:06,089
Send me off to bed forevermore

1007
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:11,810
Send me off to bed forevermore
