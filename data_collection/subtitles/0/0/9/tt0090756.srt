1
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,445
Blue velvet

2
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,613
Whoa- Whoa

3
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:55,954
She wore blue velvet

4
00:01:56,048 --> 00:01:57,423
Whoa- Whoa

5
00:01:57,508 --> 00:02:01,208
Bluer than velvet was the night

6
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:03,177
Whoa- Whoa- Whoa

7
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:07,212
Softer than satin was the light

8
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,351
From the stars

9
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:18,850
She wore blue velvet

10
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,434
Whoa- Whoa

11
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:24,194
Bluer than velvet were her eyes

12
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:26,108
Whoa- Whoa- Whoa

13
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,529
Warmer than May her tender sighs

14
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:36,161
Love was ours

15
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:42,120
Ours a love I held tightly

16
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:47,668
Feeling the rapture grow

17
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:52,927
Like a flame burning brightly

18
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:56,968
But when she left

19
00:02:58,146 --> 00:03:04,563
Gone was the glow of blue velvet

20
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,777
Whoa- Whoa

21
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:10,445
But in my heart there'll always be

22
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:12,359
Whoa- Whoa- Whoa

23
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:16,364
Precious and warm a memory

24
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,953
Through the years...

25
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,314
Logs, logs, logs

26
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,271
Glamour in the pines

27
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:54,065
Lumberton

28
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:59,446
USA

29
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:03,997
It's a sunny, woodsy day in Lumberton,
so get those chain saws out.

30
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:08,327
This is the mighty W-O-O-D,
the musical voice of Lumberton.

31
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:10,493
At the sound of the falling tree...

32
00:04:12,297 --> 00:04:14,704
it's 9.30!

33
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:19,590
There's a whole lotta wood
Waitin' out there, so let's get goin'.

34
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,816
Mr Beaumont?

35
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,946
Your son Jeffrey's here to see you.

36
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:03,125
Hey, Dad.

37
00:06:57,653 --> 00:07:01,070
Do you have a Detective Williams
still working here?

38
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:03,694
Yes, he's up in room 221.

39
00:07:03,785 --> 00:07:07,532
- Right up the stairs, through that door.
- Thanks.

40
00:07:22,468 --> 00:07:24,959
Detective Williams?

41
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,095
Yes?

42
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:35,596
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont. I live near
you. I believe you know my father Tom?

43
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:39,388
- Beaumont's Hardware Store?
- Sure I do. I hear he's in the hospital.

44
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:42,934
- How's he doing?
- Well, he's OK, I guess. I hope.

45
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:47,436
They're doing tests.
I was at the hospital this morning

46
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:51,612
and, coming home through
the field behind Vista,

47
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:54,408
I... found an ear.

48
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:58,035
You did? A human ear?

49
00:07:58,124 --> 00:08:00,959
Yeah. I thought I should bring it to you.

50
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:04,164
Yeah, that's right. Let's take a look at it.

51
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:11,179
Yes, that's a human ear, all right.

52
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:14,425
Let's see what the coroner makes of it.

53
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:17,266
Then I want you to show me
exactly where you found it.

54
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,426
All right.

55
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:25,518
We'll check the morgue records,
but I don't recall anything minus an ear.

56
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:28,853
The person may very well
still be alive somewhere.

57
00:08:28,944 --> 00:08:31,779
What can you tell about the person
from the ear?

58
00:08:31,863 --> 00:08:34,864
Once the tests are done, quite a lot.

59
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,283
Sex, blood type,
whether the ear came off a dead person.

60
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,987
Also, it looks like
the ear was cut off with scissors.

61
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:16,105
- I'm goin' out for a while.
- Do you want the car?

62
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:18,520
- No, I'm just gonna walk around.
- All right.

63
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:21,105
You're not going down by Lincoln,
are you?

64
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:24,236
No, just around the neighbourhood.
Don't worry.

65
00:09:25,662 --> 00:09:28,199
OK, honey.

66
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:44,601
Hello. My name is Jeffrey Beaumont.
Is Detective Williams here?

67
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:48,356
- Oh, yes. Yes, Jeffrey, come on in.
- Thanks.

68
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:58,864
Well, Jeffrey, you found
something very interesting.

69
00:10:58,954 --> 00:11:02,489
Very interesting. I know you must
be curious to know more.

70
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,745
But I have to ask you not only
not to tell anybody about your find,

71
00:11:07,837 --> 00:11:10,754
but also not to ask more about the case.

72
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,841
One day when it's all sewed up,

73
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:16,382
I'll let you know all the details.

74
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:18,593
Right now, though, I can't.

75
00:11:18,681 --> 00:11:22,678
I understand.
I'm just real curious, like you said.

76
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:27,261
I was the same way myself
when I was your age.

77
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:31,769
- That's what got me into this business.
- Must be great.

78
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,686
It's horrible, too.

79
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:38,940
I'm sorry, Jeffrey.
That's the way it has to be.

80
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,401
Anyway, I know you do understand.

81
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,237
Sure.

82
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:51,288
- Thanks for the card for Dad.
- You're welcome. Nice to meet you.

83
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,453
You, too.

84
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,132
- Say hello to Sandy for me.
- We will.

85
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:03,721
- Good night, Jeffrey.
- Good night.

86
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:19,685
Are you the one that found the ear?

87
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:40,326
How did you know?

88
00:12:44,258 --> 00:12:46,750
I just know, that's all.

89
00:12:47,386 --> 00:12:51,086
- I remember you from Central.
- Are you a senior?

90
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:52,212
Yup.

91
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:54,845
- How is Central these days?
- Terrible.

92
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:57,768
- I don't know... Boring.
- What else is new!

93
00:12:57,853 --> 00:12:59,929
So what are you doin' now?

94
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:02,939
I'm home from school.
My father's in the hospital.

95
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:05,148
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

96
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:07,311
What do you know about the ear?

97
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:11,152
- Didn't Dad say not to talk about it?
- Yeah, but you brought it up.

98
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:12,651
You know anything?

99
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:16,574
I don't know much but bits
and pieces. I hear things.

100
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,370
Yeah?

101
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:23,033
- My room is above my father's office so...
- Above your father's office?

102
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:26,247
- So I heard a few things about the ear.
- Uh-huh. And?

103
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:30,667
Well... there are a couple of cases
I get mixed up on.

104
00:13:30,758 --> 00:13:33,794
But one name that keeps coming up
is this woman singer.

105
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:37,171
She lives in an apartment
real close to your house.

106
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:39,719
Close to the field
where you found the ear.

107
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:42,643
It's a strange world, isn't it?

108
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,594
- Yeah.
- Where is this apartment?

109
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:48,522
It's really close by.
That's what's so creepy.

110
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:50,683
They had her under surveillance,

111
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:55,984
'cept I don't know what they found out
cos she's not my dad's case. So...

112
00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:59,073
I guess you gotta get
back home pretty soon, huh?

113
00:13:59,158 --> 00:14:01,115
Not really. Why?

114
00:14:01,203 --> 00:14:03,029
Well...

115
00:14:03,121 --> 00:14:06,870
- You... wanna see the building.
- Yeah.

116
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,530
- Come on, I'll show you.
- OK.

117
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:14,423
Hey, baby. Hey, babe.

118
00:14:17,426 --> 00:14:20,212
That's her building right there.

119
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:23,387
She lives on the seventh floor.

120
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,012
Come on.

121
00:14:45,743 --> 00:14:50,036
So... what are you gonna do
now that you're home?

122
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:52,826
Help out at my father's hardware store.

123
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:56,036
They're giving me my own hours,
which is nice.

124
00:14:58,712 --> 00:15:01,084
I used to know a kid that lived there.

125
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:04,209
Had the biggest tongue in the world.

126
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:08,335
What happened to him?

127
00:15:09,264 --> 00:15:12,383
I don't know. He moved away.

128
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:15,048
All my old friends are gone.

129
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:24,191
- You know the chicken walk?
- What's that?

130
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:31,775
That's kind of interesting.

131
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,295
Coffee time.

132
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:57,427
Hey, Double Ed, where are the overalls?

133
00:15:57,516 --> 00:16:02,806
They're on the bottom shelf, rolled up,
where they've always been.

134
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,054
Hey, Ed, how many fingers?

135
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,059
Four.

136
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,771
I still don't know how you do that.

137
00:16:11,861 --> 00:16:15,445
Now listen. You sure you don't
need me or this rig for a while?

138
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:19,481
If you wanna spray for bugs,
Jeffrey, it causes us no pain.

139
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:21,821
Okey-dokey, Double Ed.

140
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:25,163
- Oh, it's so good to have you back.
- Yeah, sure.

141
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:49,347
You hungry or thirsty, or both?

142
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,358
- I don't know.
- I'd like to talk to you about somethin'.

143
00:16:55,068 --> 00:16:57,310
Wait just a minute.

144
00:16:58,237 --> 00:17:01,273
Listen. Don't you guys
dare say anything to Mike.

145
00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:04,070
- Sure.
- It's not what you think, OK?

146
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,864
- Promise?
- Whatever you say.

147
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:13,499
- I don't wanna cause trouble.
- I'm here, aren't I?

148
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:15,873
- He is nice-lookin'.
- Yeah.

149
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:23,004
You ever been to Arlene's?

150
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:25,002
Of course.

151
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:41,390
Now are you gonna tell me
why we're here?

152
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:50,442
There are opportunities in life
for gaining knowledge and experience.

153
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,697
Sometimes it's necessary to take a risk.

154
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,325
I'll bet someone could learn a lot
by getting into that woman's apartment.

155
00:18:00,418 --> 00:18:03,787
You know, sneak in, hide, and observe.

156
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,249
- Sneak into her apartment?
- Yeah.

157
00:18:07,342 --> 00:18:09,001
Are you crazy?

158
00:18:09,092 --> 00:18:13,422
Jeffrey, she's possibly involved in murder.
This is givin' me the creeps.

159
00:18:13,513 --> 00:18:17,428
Now just settle down.
I have a plan which I think will work.

160
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:21,349
There's very little for you to do,
but I do need your help.

161
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:24,142
Don't you even wanna hear the plan?

162
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:28,936
Tell me any plan you want, but it's not
going any further than this diner.

163
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,481
Sandy,

164
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:34,063
don't take that attitude.

165
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:40,033
All right. The first thing I need
is to get into her apartment

166
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,035
- And open a window to crawl into later.
- How are you gonna do that?

167
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:48,869
Right out in the car I happen to have
some old overalls and a bug-spraying rig.

168
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:54,292
I will go to her apartment as a pest-control
man. I will spray her apartment.

169
00:18:54,925 --> 00:19:00,132
You knock on the door, draw her attention
away from me, and I'll jimmy a window.

170
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:05,759
- And what do I say to her at the door?
- You will be a Jehovah's witness.

171
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:08,971
I have some Awake!  magazines for you.

172
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,650
I don't need very much time,
just a few seconds. Whaddaya think?

173
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:16,895
I don't know.

174
00:19:16,987 --> 00:19:22,610
I mean, it sounds like a good daydream,
but... actually doing it's too weird.

175
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,740
- It's too dangerous.
- Sandy, let's just try the first part.

176
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:34,201
No one will suspect us.

177
00:19:34,294 --> 00:19:40,083
No one would think two people like us
would be crazy enough to do this.

178
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:42,132
You have a point there.

179
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:56,682
Give me at least three minutes.

180
00:19:56,773 --> 00:20:01,814
I can stall if it's more, but I need time
to find a good window. All right?

181
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:03,979
All right.

182
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:06,147
Let's go.

183
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,493
Here I go.

184
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,126
Wait a minute. What's her name?

185
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:26,048
Oh, brother, Jeffrey.

186
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:29,134
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

187
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:33,670
Look on her mailbox
for the number, bright boy.

188
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:36,800
Thanks.

189
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:40,097
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

190
00:20:40,646 --> 00:20:43,481
OK. Good luck.

191
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:45,766
Good luck yourself.

192
00:20:46,985 --> 00:20:49,476
Three minutes. No sooner.

193
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:38,827
Yes? What is it?

194
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,003
Pest control. I gotta do your apartment.

195
00:22:44,216 --> 00:22:48,428
- That stuff stinks.
- This is new stuff. There's no smell.

196
00:22:48,512 --> 00:22:50,385
Good.

197
00:23:03,275 --> 00:23:05,848
Just need to do the kitchen.

198
00:23:33,469 --> 00:23:36,138
Grand Central Station.

199
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,975
It's only the bug man.

200
00:24:18,802 --> 00:24:21,292
- That should do it.
- Yeah?

201
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:30,928
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. What happened?

202
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:34,057
I was about to go to the door
when that guy did it for me.

203
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:37,185
- Was it all right?
- Yes and no. Did you recognise him?

204
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:40,976
I only saw his back. I think
he went out a door at the end of the hall.

205
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:44,653
I didn't get a good look at him either,
but he sure looked at me.

206
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:48,988
I didn't have time to get a window,
but I found these keys. Nifty, huh?

207
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:51,651
Yeah, if they open the door.

208
00:24:51,747 --> 00:24:53,491
Yeah.

209
00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:12,760
So, what's next?

210
00:25:13,476 --> 00:25:18,221
- Are you game for more?
- I owe you one since I goofed this one up.

211
00:25:18,313 --> 00:25:22,476
You didn't goof it up.
But... you still owe me one.

212
00:25:28,322 --> 00:25:30,859
I'm gonna try and sneak in tonight.

213
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:35,369
It's Friday. Do you have a date?

214
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:38,823
Yeah. I do.

215
00:25:44,712 --> 00:25:47,832
Well, that does that.

216
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:06,605
- You really wanna do this, don't you?
- I don't want you to get involved.

217
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:09,311
I do, but if something went wrong...

218
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:12,734
Like you said,
they may be involved in murder.

219
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:21,366
OK. I'll tell Mike I'm sick.

220
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:25,912
Just so the record
is kept straight, though,

221
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:28,288
I love Mike.

222
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,874
What do you want me to do?

223
00:26:35,508 --> 00:26:40,503
First we'll have a really nice dinner. Try
to find out where Dorothy Vallens sings.

224
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:43,715
I already know.
The Slow Club on Route 7.

225
00:26:43,807 --> 00:26:46,215
Great. I'll pick you up about eight?

226
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,310
Don't pick me up.
My dad might think it's strange.

227
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:53,815
I'll walk over to your house.
I'll be there at eight o'clock. OK?

228
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:57,019
You better get out
before someone sees us.

229
00:27:04,784 --> 00:27:06,860
See ya!

230
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:36,644
Wait. Here's to an interesting
experience, huh?

231
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,806
I'll drink to that.

232
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:48,023
Man, I like Heineken!
You like Heineken?

233
00:27:48,116 --> 00:27:53,072
- I never really had Heineken before.
- You never had Heineken before?

234
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:55,652
My dad drinks Bud.

235
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,955
- King of beers.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

236
00:28:00,043 --> 00:28:03,956
the Blue Lady, Miss Dorothy Vallens.

237
00:28:21,812 --> 00:28:23,888
She

238
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,057
Wore

239
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:37,114
Blue velvet

240
00:28:39,036 --> 00:28:45,868
Bluer than velvet was the night

241
00:28:46,626 --> 00:28:52,498
Softer than satin was the light

242
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:56,290
From the stars

243
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:08,472
She wore blue velvet

244
00:29:10,273 --> 00:29:16,226
Bluer than velvet were her eyes

245
00:29:18,113 --> 00:29:21,031
Shadows

246
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:26,943
Fall so blue

247
00:29:28,331 --> 00:29:34,498
As lonely as a blue

248
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:37,038
Blue

249
00:29:37,631 --> 00:29:41,877
Star

250
00:30:05,781 --> 00:30:09,826
- Jeffrey, you shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

251
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,408
Cos it's crazy... and dangerous.

252
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:18,074
- My God, I should have never told you.
- I'll be all right.

253
00:30:18,168 --> 00:30:22,912
I don't think you should stay. I think you
should go home. Can you drive this car?

254
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:27,382
- Yeah, but I...
- Leave it in front of your house, OK?

255
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:28,547
OK.

256
00:30:28,635 --> 00:30:31,754
I'll see ya tomorrow
and I'll tell ya how it went.

257
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:35,136
I don't wanna see you tomorrow.

258
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:39,554
- Mike's coming over.
- OK. Can I call you?

259
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:44,096
OK, yeah, call.

260
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:47,524
I hope you sneak out OK.

261
00:30:50,614 --> 00:30:53,697
- I'm gonna wait here until she comes.
- Sandy...

262
00:30:53,783 --> 00:30:56,024
I'm gonna honk four times.

263
00:30:56,119 --> 00:31:01,278
I'll go one, two, three, four,
and then you'll hear it

264
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:04,955
- And you'll know she's on her way up.
- OK.

265
00:31:07,712 --> 00:31:12,088
I don't know if you're
a detective or a pervert.

266
00:31:12,174 --> 00:31:15,875
Well, that's for me to know
and you to find out.

267
00:31:30,316 --> 00:31:31,858
See ya.

268
00:31:31,942 --> 00:31:33,519
Bye.

269
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,572
Heineken.

270
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:24,295
I hope you're OK, Jeffrey.

271
00:34:43,824 --> 00:34:47,524
Thank you, Jimmy.
See you tomorrow. Good night.

272
00:35:16,186 --> 00:35:21,810
Hello? Yes, sir. Frank?
Frank, let me talk to him.

273
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,472
Please, Frank... sir.

274
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:29,397
I like to sing "Blue Velvet".

275
00:35:31,575 --> 00:35:37,660
Don... Don, it's all right, don't worry.
Don! Don, can you hear me?

276
00:35:37,747 --> 00:35:40,286
Is little Donny all right?

277
00:35:42,168 --> 00:35:44,659
Is he there with you?

278
00:35:46,338 --> 00:35:48,414
Don?

279
00:35:50,676 --> 00:35:55,467
You mean Meadow Lane?
Frank! Frank, what's the matter with him?

280
00:35:58,265 --> 00:36:01,765
I know. I'll be sweet.

281
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,011
Mommy loves you.

282
00:36:07,316 --> 00:36:09,807
OK, Frank... sir.

283
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:20,723
Get out of there! Get out!

284
00:38:20,811 --> 00:38:23,930
Put your hands up! On your head! Do it!

285
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:27,267
Get on your knees! Do it!

286
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,268
What are you doing?

287
00:38:29,361 --> 00:38:32,944
- Who are you? What's your name?
- Jeffrey.

288
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:35,567
- Jeffrey what?
- Jeffrey nothing.

289
00:38:37,743 --> 00:38:40,779
Give me your wallet.
Give me your wallet!

290
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:51,997
Jeffrey Beaumont. What are you doing
in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?

291
00:38:52,089 --> 00:38:55,672
- I wanted to see you.
- Are you kidding?

292
00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:57,835
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.

293
00:38:57,928 --> 00:39:01,427
- I've seen you before.
- I sprayed your apartment.

294
00:39:01,515 --> 00:39:05,761
I took your key. I didn't mean
to do anything except see you.

295
00:39:05,851 --> 00:39:08,343
What did you see, tonight?

296
00:39:08,438 --> 00:39:12,352
- Tell me!
- I saw you come in, talk on the phone...

297
00:39:12,442 --> 00:39:15,311
- And then?
- You got undressed.

298
00:39:17,612 --> 00:39:21,147
Do you sneak in girls' apartments
to see them get undressed?

299
00:39:21,241 --> 00:39:23,317
No, never before this.

300
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:28,536
- Get undressed. I want to see you.
- Look, I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

301
00:39:28,622 --> 00:39:31,409
No way! I want to see you! Get undressed!

302
00:39:49,474 --> 00:39:51,550
Stand up.

303
00:40:05,613 --> 00:40:08,104
Come closer.

304
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,038
Closer.

305
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,213
What do you want?

306
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,633
I don't know.

307
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:50,273
Don't move. Don't look at me.

308
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:04,158
- Do you like that?
- Yes.

309
00:41:06,961 --> 00:41:09,333
Don't touch me! Or I'll kill you!

310
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:14,093
Do you like talk like that?

311
00:41:14,176 --> 00:41:15,966
No.

312
00:41:18,138 --> 00:41:20,711
Get over there on that couch.

313
00:41:26,103 --> 00:41:28,179
Lie down.

314
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:49,330
Shut up! Don't say anything.
Hide in the closet.

315
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:52,666
Don't say anything, or I'll kill you.
I mean it.

316
00:42:24,655 --> 00:42:26,862
- Hello, baby.
- Shut up!

317
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:30,485
It's Daddy, you shithead!
Where's my bourbon?

318
00:42:33,456 --> 00:42:36,622
Can't you fuckin' remember anything?

319
00:42:49,887 --> 00:42:51,963
Now it's dark.

320
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:02,056
Spread your legs.

321
00:43:13,075 --> 00:43:15,150
Wider.

322
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,610
Now show it to me.

323
00:43:39,557 --> 00:43:42,677
Don't you fuckin' look at me.

324
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,536
Mommy...

325
00:44:20,303 --> 00:44:23,303
Mommy! Mommy!

326
00:44:24,014 --> 00:44:27,049
- Mommy...
- Mommy loves you, Frank.

327
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:30,263
Baby wants to fuck!

328
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:36,892
All right, get ready to fuck!
You fucker's fucker! You fucker!

329
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:42,280
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

330
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:01,453
Baby wants blue velvet.

331
00:45:24,152 --> 00:45:28,611
Don't you fuckin' look at me!
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

332
00:45:32,659 --> 00:45:36,241
Look at me. Daddy's coming home.

333
00:45:39,207 --> 00:45:40,998
Daddy's comin' home.

334
00:45:43,586 --> 00:45:46,290
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

335
00:45:48,841 --> 00:45:51,046
Daddy's comin' home.

336
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,806
Mommy! Mommy!

337
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:29,583
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

338
00:46:31,296 --> 00:46:33,869
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

339
00:46:52,148 --> 00:46:54,853
Now it's dark.

340
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:11,075
You stay alive, baby.

341
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:16,164
Do it for Van Gogh.

342
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,730
Why don't you lie down?

343
00:47:52,285 --> 00:47:54,776
Come on, I'll help you.

344
00:48:04,255 --> 00:48:06,246
I don't like that.

345
00:48:06,338 --> 00:48:08,415
What do you want?

346
00:48:08,508 --> 00:48:10,583
Nothing.

347
00:48:11,386 --> 00:48:13,877
Are you all right?

348
00:48:16,348 --> 00:48:18,424
Yeah, I'm all right.

349
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:22,811
I'm all right.

350
00:48:22,896 --> 00:48:25,387
I'll go, then.

351
00:48:25,982 --> 00:48:27,809
Don?

352
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,608
- Oh, Don!
- No...

353
00:48:29,694 --> 00:48:33,395
Oh, Don, hold me. Hold me.

354
00:48:33,489 --> 00:48:36,738
I'm scared. I'm scared.

355
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:39,318
I'm scared!

356
00:48:39,703 --> 00:48:41,779
It's OK. It's OK.

357
00:48:41,872 --> 00:48:44,445
Don? Don?

358
00:48:47,084 --> 00:48:49,160
Are you back?

359
00:48:58,845 --> 00:49:00,921
Do you like me?

360
00:49:04,893 --> 00:49:07,465
- Do you like me?
- Yes.

361
00:49:16,485 --> 00:49:19,059
Do you like the way I feel?

362
00:49:19,155 --> 00:49:21,231
Yes.

363
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,570
See my breast?

364
00:49:33,001 --> 00:49:35,492
You can feel it.

365
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:41,795
My nipple is getting hard.

366
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:46,210
You can touch it.

367
00:49:51,309 --> 00:49:53,681
You can feel it.

368
00:49:55,063 --> 00:49:57,767
Do you like the way I feel?

369
00:49:58,857 --> 00:50:00,933
Yes.

370
00:50:03,112 --> 00:50:05,188
Feel me.

371
00:50:09,825 --> 00:50:11,949
Hit me.

372
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:16,163
- Dorothy, no. Stop it.
- Hit me.

373
00:50:16,249 --> 00:50:17,872
Hit me.

374
00:50:18,124 --> 00:50:20,118
Hit me!

375
00:50:58,203 --> 00:51:01,536
I'm leaving now.

376
00:51:01,622 --> 00:51:04,327
Torned.

377
00:51:05,835 --> 00:51:07,993
Torned.

378
00:51:10,088 --> 00:51:12,165
Help me.

379
00:51:35,737 --> 00:51:38,856
Oh, my God. That hat.

380
00:51:41,158 --> 00:51:43,400
She's married.

381
00:51:43,494 --> 00:51:44,739
"Don."

382
00:51:54,337 --> 00:51:55,997
Help me.

383
00:52:39,419 --> 00:52:41,044
Now it's dark.

384
00:52:41,462 --> 00:52:43,870
Hit me. Hit me.

385
00:52:53,056 --> 00:52:55,133
Man, oh man.

386
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:03,852
- Sandy, can ya talk?
- Mike's here.

387
00:53:03,941 --> 00:53:06,859
Oh. I guess I'll talk to you later, then.

388
00:53:06,944 --> 00:53:10,727
- Well, how'd it go?
- It went OK. I'll tell you about it.

389
00:53:10,822 --> 00:53:12,364
I'll pick you up at eight.

390
00:53:12,449 --> 00:53:16,198
New axe, 48721.

391
00:53:17,286 --> 00:53:19,575
Twenty-two...

392
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,870
ninety-five.

393
00:53:24,127 --> 00:53:26,664
- I'll see ya then.
- OK, great.

394
00:53:26,754 --> 00:53:28,829
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

395
00:54:06,332 --> 00:54:07,908
Well?

396
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:11,621
Aren't you gonna tell me about it?

397
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,879
OK.

398
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:21,668
It's a strange world, Sandy.

399
00:54:27,393 --> 00:54:31,139
Dorothy Vallens is married,
to a man named Don.

400
00:54:32,104 --> 00:54:34,180
They have a son.

401
00:54:35,732 --> 00:54:40,643
I think the son and the husband have
been kidnapped by a man named Frank.

402
00:54:40,737 --> 00:54:44,402
Frank has done this
to force Dorothy to do things for him.

403
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:48,654
I think she wants to die.

404
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:53,451
I think Frank cut the ear I found
off her husband

405
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,660
as a warning for her to stay alive.

406
00:54:58,127 --> 00:55:00,416
Frank is...

407
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,379
a very dangerous man.

408
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:08,377
My God.

409
00:55:09,805 --> 00:55:13,755
- Shouldn't you tell my father?
- No. I can't do that.

410
00:55:14,684 --> 00:55:18,977
I can't prove any of this.
I found out my information illegally.

411
00:55:19,063 --> 00:55:21,980
You could get into a lot of trouble.

412
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,105
You saw all that in one night?

413
00:55:29,113 --> 00:55:31,783
It is a strange world.

414
00:55:38,122 --> 00:55:40,909
Why are there people like Frank?

415
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,582
Why is there
so much trouble in this world?

416
00:55:45,212 --> 00:55:47,288
I don't know.

417
00:55:52,593 --> 00:55:55,547
I had a dream.

418
00:55:58,265 --> 00:56:00,672
In fact, it was the night I met you.

419
00:56:08,107 --> 00:56:11,523
In the dream, there was our world,

420
00:56:12,528 --> 00:56:16,608
and the world was dark
because there weren't any robins.

421
00:56:16,699 --> 00:56:19,367
And the robins represented love.

422
00:56:22,537 --> 00:56:26,998
And for the longest time
there was just this darkness.

423
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:30,034
And all of a sudden

424
00:56:30,127 --> 00:56:33,330
thousands of robins were set free.

425
00:56:33,422 --> 00:56:38,463
And they flew down and
brought this blinding light of love.

426
00:56:39,844 --> 00:56:42,715
And it seemed like that love

427
00:56:43,765 --> 00:56:47,430
would be the only thing
that would make any difference,

428
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:50,345
and it did.

429
00:56:59,695 --> 00:57:02,103
So I guess it means...

430
00:57:03,408 --> 00:57:06,076
there is trouble till the robins come.

431
00:57:08,703 --> 00:57:10,696
You're a neat girl.

432
00:57:11,748 --> 00:57:13,788
So are you.

433
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:16,366
I mean... you're a neat guy.

434
00:57:27,262 --> 00:57:28,970
I guess we better go.

435
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:32,880
Yeah. I guess so.

436
00:57:59,499 --> 00:58:02,120
Hi. May I come in?

437
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:04,250
Yes.

438
00:58:06,172 --> 00:58:08,249
Hurry, though.

439
00:58:16,223 --> 00:58:18,382
Are you all right?

440
00:58:18,475 --> 00:58:20,597
No, I'm not.

441
00:58:22,229 --> 00:58:24,304
Why are you here?

442
00:58:24,397 --> 00:58:26,474
What do you want?

443
00:58:28,859 --> 00:58:31,859
I looked for you in my closet tonight.

444
00:58:34,573 --> 00:58:39,318
It's crazy, I know.
I don't know where you come from, but...

445
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,486
I like you.

446
00:58:42,497 --> 00:58:46,281
It's not crazy. I like you too.

447
00:58:50,837 --> 00:58:53,838
I liked being with you last night.

448
00:58:54,215 --> 00:58:56,292
Same here.

449
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:04,428
Please be with me. Be with me, please.

450
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:12,563
Like a flame burning brightly

451
00:59:14,526 --> 00:59:17,692
But when she left

452
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:22,693
Gone was the glow

453
00:59:22,783 --> 00:59:24,740
Of

454
00:59:24,952 --> 00:59:31,239
Blue velvet

455
00:59:32,876 --> 00:59:38,036
But in my heart there'll always be

456
00:59:40,632 --> 00:59:45,425
Precious and warm a memory

457
00:59:46,555 --> 00:59:50,633
Through the years

458
00:59:54,687 --> 00:59:59,728
And I still can see

459
01:00:00,526 --> 01:00:04,108
Blue velvet

460
01:00:05,155 --> 01:00:13,245
Through my tears

461
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,000
USA

462
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:07,180
Logs, logs, logs. Lumberton, USA.

463
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,966
At the sound of the falling tree...

464
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:12,894
it's 1.30.

465
01:02:12,978 --> 01:02:15,054
This is the mighty voice of Lumberton,

466
01:02:15,147 --> 01:02:19,097
the town where people really know
how much wood a woodchuck chucks.

467
01:02:20,193 --> 01:02:22,315
...seven, eight, nine,

468
01:02:22,403 --> 01:02:24,859
10, 1 1, 1 2,

469
01:02:24,947 --> 01:02:27,439
1 3, 1 4, 1 5,

470
01:02:27,533 --> 01:02:30,569
16, 1 7, 18, 1 9, 20...

471
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,238
Keep going.

472
01:02:32,329 --> 01:02:33,491
Sandy.

473
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,494
Oh, great.

474
01:02:42,672 --> 01:02:45,245
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

475
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:48,840
- What am I gonna do now?
- You wanna go talk to him?

476
01:02:48,928 --> 01:02:52,924
Yeah, but...
I don't think it's gonna do much good.

477
01:02:53,014 --> 01:02:55,849
Let's just go. I'll try to talk to him later.

478
01:03:04,942 --> 01:03:07,647
See that clock on the wall?

479
01:03:09,321 --> 01:03:10,898
Yeah.

480
01:03:10,989 --> 01:03:14,821
Five minutes from now, you're not
gonna believe what I've told you.

481
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:21,329
Number one.

482
01:03:22,624 --> 01:03:26,408
Today I staked out Frank's place
With a camera.

483
01:03:26,795 --> 01:03:32,630
There's another man involved in all this.
I call him the Yellow Man.

484
01:03:32,716 --> 01:03:35,837
You saw his back the other day
at Dorothy's apartment.

485
01:03:35,929 --> 01:03:41,432
Today I saw the Yellow Man go into
Frank's building, laughing with Frank.

486
01:03:42,142 --> 01:03:45,511
Now, the only trouble is,
what does that prove?

487
01:03:45,604 --> 01:03:49,387
Nothing, really. But it's interesting.

488
01:03:51,734 --> 01:03:53,941
Number two.

489
01:03:54,028 --> 01:03:55,902
I saw the Yellow Man come out

490
01:03:55,988 --> 01:03:59,689
and meet a well-dressed man
carrying an alligator briefcase.

491
01:04:14,254 --> 01:04:18,501
They went to a factory, stood on
a staircase and looked into the distance.

492
01:04:23,179 --> 01:04:27,472
Now get this. In the distance,
there was a murder.

493
01:04:28,434 --> 01:04:32,016
A drug dealer was shot to death
and a woman had her legs broken.

494
01:04:32,104 --> 01:04:34,179
Jeffrey...

495
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:42,441
Then two guys told me the police would
find drugs in the dead dealer's place.

496
01:04:43,322 --> 01:04:46,407
I can't believe what you're finding out.

497
01:04:47,785 --> 01:04:51,283
Are you gonna continue with this?

498
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:53,447
Yeah.

499
01:04:53,915 --> 01:04:56,584
Until when?
What are you gonna do with this?

500
01:04:56,668 --> 01:04:59,241
Well, I don't know.

501
01:05:01,171 --> 01:05:04,375
You're not going back to her apartment?

502
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:06,340
Yeah.

503
01:05:07,928 --> 01:05:10,335
Jeffrey, why?

504
01:05:12,557 --> 01:05:16,305
I'm seeing something
that was always hidden.

505
01:05:17,687 --> 01:05:21,636
I'm involved in a mystery.
I'm in the middle of a mystery.

506
01:05:21,732 --> 01:05:24,305
And it's all secret.

507
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:28,106
You like mysteries that much?

508
01:05:28,197 --> 01:05:30,271
Yeah.

509
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:35,400
You're a mystery.

510
01:05:35,911 --> 01:05:37,988
I like you...

511
01:05:38,789 --> 01:05:40,781
very much.

512
01:05:50,257 --> 01:05:52,333
Yeah?

513
01:06:00,266 --> 01:06:03,386
Jeffrey, don't. Please.

514
01:06:11,777 --> 01:06:14,447
You worry about me? Really?

515
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:16,273
Yeah.

516
01:06:16,365 --> 01:06:18,856
Is that so surprising?

517
01:06:19,368 --> 01:06:21,858
Yeah, I worry... a lot.

518
01:06:24,289 --> 01:06:27,373
I got you into this.

519
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:33,619
Blue velvet

520
01:06:33,713 --> 01:06:35,373
Whoa- Whoa

521
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:45,176
She wore blue velvet

522
01:06:45,265 --> 01:06:46,380
Whoa- Whoa

523
01:06:46,517 --> 01:06:50,265
Bluer than velvet was the night

524
01:06:50,354 --> 01:06:52,180
Whoa- Whoa- Whoa

525
01:06:52,271 --> 01:06:56,316
Softer than satin was the light

526
01:06:57,152 --> 01:07:00,519
From the stars

527
01:07:01,738 --> 01:07:07,860
She wore blue velvet

528
01:07:08,204 --> 01:07:09,484
Whoa- Whoa

529
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:13,327
Bluer than velvet were her eyes

530
01:07:13,415 --> 01:07:15,124
Whoa- Whoa- Whoa

531
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:19,539
Warmer than May her tender sighs

532
01:07:20,089 --> 01:07:22,840
Love was ours

533
01:07:36,062 --> 01:07:38,138
Come to my bedroom.

534
01:07:54,745 --> 01:07:57,118
What do you want to do?

535
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:59,282
I'm doing it.

536
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:02,412
Are you a bad boy?

537
01:08:02,501 --> 01:08:04,541
What do you mean?

538
01:08:04,629 --> 01:08:07,748
Do you wanna do bad things?

539
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,715
Anything.

540
01:08:09,926 --> 01:08:11,882
Anything.

541
01:08:14,221 --> 01:08:16,509
What do you want?

542
01:08:16,598 --> 01:08:18,674
I want you to hurt me.

543
01:08:18,767 --> 01:08:23,179
No. I don't wanna hurt you.
I told you, I wanna help you.

544
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:26,188
Dorothy, I know
some of what's happening.

545
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:29,227
Frank has your husband and son,
doesn't he?

546
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:33,396
Dorothy, you gotta do something,
go to the police or...

547
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:37,232
No police!

548
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:39,110
No police!

549
01:08:39,203 --> 01:08:40,233
Don!

550
01:08:40,328 --> 01:08:42,699
- Hit me!
- No! No!

551
01:08:42,788 --> 01:08:45,908
Get away! Get away from my bed!
Stay away!

552
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:17,396
I have your disease in me now.

553
01:09:41,925 --> 01:09:44,416
It used to make me laugh.

554
01:09:45,637 --> 01:09:48,128
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

555
01:09:49,849 --> 01:09:52,553
- I should go.
- Yes.

556
01:09:59,274 --> 01:10:02,108
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

557
01:10:02,193 --> 01:10:04,482
I want you to stay.

558
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:08,319
- Don't hate me.
- I sure don't hate you.

559
01:10:08,991 --> 01:10:11,150
I'm not crazy.

560
01:10:11,244 --> 01:10:15,157
I know the difference
between right and wrong.

561
01:10:15,247 --> 01:10:17,535
That's good.

562
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:21,662
You're my special friend.

563
01:10:24,631 --> 01:10:27,334
I still have you inside of me.

564
01:10:28,175 --> 01:10:30,252
It helps me.

565
01:10:31,011 --> 01:10:33,087
I need you.

566
01:10:34,473 --> 01:10:36,382
I'll call you.

567
01:10:36,474 --> 01:10:38,513
OK.

568
01:10:38,852 --> 01:10:40,844
Soon?

569
01:10:43,564 --> 01:10:46,683
- Are you lying to me?
- No.

570
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:49,692
- Are you sure?
- Hey!

571
01:10:51,696 --> 01:10:54,401
Hello, baby.

572
01:10:54,866 --> 01:10:59,991
- Who is this fuck?
- A friend. He's from the neighbourhood.

573
01:11:01,206 --> 01:11:03,280
We were just talking.

574
01:11:06,126 --> 01:11:08,747
You're from the neighbourhood.

575
01:11:08,837 --> 01:11:10,296
Yeah.

576
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:12,870
You're a neighbour.

577
01:11:13,925 --> 01:11:17,922
- Well, what's your name, neighbour?
- Jeffrey.

578
01:11:18,011 --> 01:11:20,503
He's a good kid, Frank.

579
01:11:21,182 --> 01:11:23,672
Shut the fuck up!

580
01:11:26,937 --> 01:11:29,095
Hey, you wanna go for a ride?

581
01:11:29,188 --> 01:11:31,016
No, thanks.

582
01:11:31,108 --> 01:11:33,942
"No, thanks"?
What does that mean?

583
01:11:34,026 --> 01:11:36,434
- I don't wanna go.
- Go where?

584
01:11:36,529 --> 01:11:40,989
- For a ride.
- A ride. Hell, that's a good idea.

585
01:11:41,075 --> 01:11:43,363
OK. Let's go.

586
01:11:46,204 --> 01:11:48,908
Let's go. Get your fuckin' robe!

587
01:11:48,999 --> 01:11:50,790
Raymond?

588
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:53,116
Come on. We're gonna go for a joyride.

589
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:55,286
Joyride.

590
01:12:08,265 --> 01:12:10,970
All right, where do you wanna go?

591
01:12:11,728 --> 01:12:14,644
Oh, I know.
We got to go to Ben's, right?

592
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:17,600
Oh, right. We've got to see Ben.

593
01:12:17,691 --> 01:12:20,016
Yeah, we got to, got to, got to, got to.

594
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:22,185
We may all be killed.

595
01:12:25,405 --> 01:12:29,784
- He's a pussy, Frank.
- Yeah, but he's our pussy.

596
01:12:29,869 --> 01:12:33,367
- Right, tits?
- Pussy heaven.

597
01:12:33,454 --> 01:12:35,862
You ever been to pussy heaven?

598
01:12:35,957 --> 01:12:37,120
No.

599
01:12:37,208 --> 01:12:41,076
- What'd he say?
- No. No. Hasn't been to pussy heaven.

600
01:12:45,216 --> 01:12:48,335
- Po-lice call. Po-lice call.
- Bury that fuck!

601
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:51,299
This...

602
01:12:51,388 --> 01:12:52,716
is...

603
01:12:52,805 --> 01:12:54,881
it.

604
01:12:55,558 --> 01:12:56,590
Raymond?

605
01:12:58,561 --> 01:12:59,592
Thank you, Raymond.

606
01:13:09,028 --> 01:13:11,105
Frank's here.

607
01:13:13,574 --> 01:13:17,619
Come on. I want you to meet
a friend of mine.

608
01:13:17,704 --> 01:13:21,700
Hey, Raymond?
You get enough beer for Ben, too.

609
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:23,663
- What beer do you like?
- Heineken.

610
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:26,585
Heineken? Fuck that shit!

611
01:13:26,669 --> 01:13:28,247
Pabst Blue Ribbon!

612
01:13:33,092 --> 01:13:35,797
I brought some friends,
I brought some beer.

613
01:13:35,886 --> 01:13:37,962
Fine, Frank, fine.

614
01:13:45,729 --> 01:13:50,390
Oh, Frank. This is a fine surprise
that you brought your friends.

615
01:13:50,483 --> 01:13:52,558
I love surprises.

616
01:13:53,485 --> 01:13:55,561
Please, sit down.

617
01:13:57,239 --> 01:14:01,948
Suave...
Goddamn, you're one suave fucker.

618
01:14:03,702 --> 01:14:06,739
- You want some beer?
- Of course, Frank.

619
01:14:06,831 --> 01:14:08,989
Darling.

620
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:15,753
Darling, could you bring some glasses?
And we'll have a beer with Frank.

621
01:14:15,839 --> 01:14:17,250
Thank you.

622
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:19,417
Please, sit down.

623
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:24,460
Shit, man. How the shit are ya?

624
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:27,933
Fine, Frank, fine. How are you?

625
01:14:28,017 --> 01:14:31,551
Fuckin' good. I'm real fuckin' good.

627
01:14:36,649 --> 01:14:39,319

628
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:47,492
That doesn't scare me.

629
01:14:51,872 --> 01:14:54,361
I'm Paul. What's your name?

630
01:14:54,456 --> 01:14:56,533
Jeffrey.

631
01:15:07,219 --> 01:15:10,422
Where's the glasses?
That beer's gonna get warm.

632
01:15:10,514 --> 01:15:15,091
One thing I can't fuckin' stand
is warm beer! It makes me fuckin' puke!

633
01:15:15,184 --> 01:15:17,935
Darling, where's the glasses?

634
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:20,890
Here, Frank. Here come the glasses.

635
01:15:20,981 --> 01:15:23,139
See, here are the glasses.

636
01:15:23,233 --> 01:15:26,934
Raymond, where's the fuckin' beer, man?

637
01:15:27,028 --> 01:15:29,186
It's right here, Frank.

638
01:15:30,323 --> 01:15:33,323
- D'you want me to pour it?
- No, I want you to fuck it!

639
01:15:33,408 --> 01:15:36,113
Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer!

640
01:15:43,835 --> 01:15:45,377
Thank you.

641
01:15:45,461 --> 01:15:48,546
- Let's drink up.
- Here's to your health.

642
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:51,336
Shit, let's drink to somethin' else.

643
01:15:52,218 --> 01:15:54,708
Let's drink to fucking.

644
01:15:56,430 --> 01:15:59,596
Yeah, say "Here's to your fuck, Frank."

645
01:15:59,683 --> 01:16:01,722
If you like, Frank.

646
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:04,810
Here's to your fuck. Cheers.

647
01:16:06,564 --> 01:16:09,897
Cheers. Wow. Suave, man.

648
01:16:10,485 --> 01:16:12,725
You are so fuckin' suave.

649
01:16:16,031 --> 01:16:18,817
- Hey, we love Ben.

650
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:21,280
- Here's to Ben!
- Here's to Ben.

651
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,789
Here's to Ben.

652
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,539
- Here's to Ben.
- Be polite!

653
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:35,916
Here's to Ben.

654
01:16:37,675 --> 01:16:39,751
See that, Ben?

655
01:16:41,012 --> 01:16:43,928
I can make him do anything I please.

656
01:16:50,062 --> 01:16:54,106
Thank you for the toast.
That was very nice, neighbour.

657
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:56,680
Did he hurt your little face?

658
01:17:00,571 --> 01:17:02,648
That feel better?

659
01:17:05,492 --> 01:17:08,244
Frank, I have something for ya.

660
01:17:08,912 --> 01:17:11,699
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

661
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:14,078
Excuse us, por favor.

662
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:17,455
Raymond, do a little baby-sitting.

663
01:17:24,384 --> 01:17:26,460
I'm Paul.

664
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:48,106
Gordon went right up to 'em in broad
daylight, cos he's the man, right?

665
01:17:48,781 --> 01:17:52,280
He took those drugs away
and it was fuckin' beautiful.

666
01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:56,652
A candy-coloured clown
they call the Sandman.

667
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:03,169
Let Tits see her kid, huh?

668
01:18:16,722 --> 01:18:20,388
A candy-coloured clown
they call the Sandman.

669
01:18:20,476 --> 01:18:22,553
Donny! Donny!

670
01:18:22,687 --> 01:18:24,762
Oh, Donny!

671
01:18:25,606 --> 01:18:29,853
No! No! Donny, Mama loves you!

672
01:18:43,747 --> 01:18:47,447
A candy-coloured clown
they call the Sandman

673
01:18:47,709 --> 01:18:50,626
Tiptoes to my room every night

674
01:18:51,713 --> 01:18:54,748
Just to sprinkle stardust
and to whisper

675
01:18:55,341 --> 01:18:56,669
"Go to sleep"

676
01:18:57,176 --> 01:19:00,925
"Everything is all right"

677
01:19:01,722 --> 01:19:05,635
I close my eyes

678
01:19:06,476 --> 01:19:10,474
Then I drift away

679
01:19:11,022 --> 01:19:15,019
Into the magic night

680
01:19:15,567 --> 01:19:18,853
I softly say

681
01:19:19,946 --> 01:19:23,694
A silent prayer

682
01:19:24,366 --> 01:19:27,818
Like dreamers do

683
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:32,947
Then I fall asleep to dream

684
01:19:33,459 --> 01:19:36,874
My dreams of you

685
01:19:39,297 --> 01:19:42,963
In dreams I walk

686
01:19:43,842 --> 01:19:45,919
With you

687
01:19:48,389 --> 01:19:52,007
In dreams I talk

688
01:19:52,894 --> 01:19:54,968
To you

689
01:19:57,397 --> 01:20:01,726
In dreams you're mine

690
01:20:02,694 --> 01:20:05,445
All the time

691
01:20:05,529 --> 01:20:09,610
We're together

692
01:20:12,119 --> 01:20:15,452
All right! Let's hit the fuckin' road!

693
01:20:15,538 --> 01:20:18,823
We're givin' our neighbour a joyride!
Let's get on with it!

694
01:20:19,376 --> 01:20:20,751
Bye, Ben.

695
01:20:20,835 --> 01:20:24,333
Anyone wanna go on a joyride with us?

696
01:20:24,421 --> 01:20:27,505
How about you? Huh?

697
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:33,379
No smile for Frank? No?

698
01:20:34,889 --> 01:20:37,379
OK, fuck it! Let's go!

699
01:20:39,352 --> 01:20:42,388
You wanna go with Raymond?
Come on.

700
01:20:45,023 --> 01:20:47,597
I'll see ya Tuesday, Frank.

701
01:20:47,984 --> 01:20:50,060
Right, Ben.

702
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:54,818
Now it's dark.

703
01:20:57,410 --> 01:20:59,817
Let's fuck!

704
01:20:59,911 --> 01:21:03,032
I'll fuck anything that moves!

705
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:23,098
Where are we going, Frank?

706
01:21:23,183 --> 01:21:27,844
I'm takin' your neighbour
out to the fuckin' country.

707
01:21:29,021 --> 01:21:31,228
Hey, do you like to walk?

708
01:21:31,316 --> 01:21:34,434
- Hey, I'm talkin' to you, shithead.
- What?

709
01:21:34,526 --> 01:21:36,851
He said "What?", Frank.

710
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,525
What.

711
01:21:44,953 --> 01:21:48,238
Hey! What has this fuck
got to do with anything?

712
01:21:48,872 --> 01:21:51,364
Jesus, goddamn.

713
01:21:58,548 --> 01:22:00,624
You fuck!

714
01:22:01,551 --> 01:22:03,840
What're you looking at?

715
01:22:03,928 --> 01:22:05,836
Nothing.

716
01:22:05,929 --> 01:22:08,420
Don't you look at me, fuck!

717
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:12,013
I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.

718
01:22:35,331 --> 01:22:37,288
You're like me.

719
01:22:43,255 --> 01:22:45,330
Oh, look at those.

720
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:48,129
What are these?

721
01:22:48,218 --> 01:22:51,669
- Please, Frank, let's go.
- Don't say please, fuckhead!

722
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:58,342
Ooh, baby...
Ooh, baby wants to pinch them.

723
01:23:00,729 --> 01:23:06,482
What's the matter? Give 'em back.
They're just a little red, that's all.

724
01:23:06,568 --> 01:23:10,019
Ooh, let me feel 'em. Come here.

725
01:23:10,113 --> 01:23:12,521
Leave her alone!

726
01:23:19,371 --> 01:23:21,364
Goddamn!

727
01:23:21,456 --> 01:23:22,785
Next!

728
01:23:22,874 --> 01:23:27,666
You, out of the car, fuck!
Get him out of the car, Raymond!

729
01:23:29,339 --> 01:23:33,502
- Frank! Frank! He didn't mean anything!
- Shut up! Shut up.

730
01:23:48,522 --> 01:23:52,057
Pretty, pretty. Pretty, pretty.

731
01:23:55,153 --> 01:23:57,360
Frank, leave him alone!

732
01:23:57,447 --> 01:23:59,356
Frank! Frank!

733
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:07,783
Paul... candy-coloured clown.

734
01:24:09,917 --> 01:24:12,288
You're fuckin' lucky to be alive.

735
01:24:12,377 --> 01:24:15,746
A candy-coloured clown
they call the Sandman

736
01:24:15,838 --> 01:24:18,709
-  Tiptoes to my room every night
- Look at me.

737
01:24:20,093 --> 01:24:23,544
Just to sprinkle stardust
and to whisper

738
01:24:23,637 --> 01:24:29,426
-  "Go to sleep, everything is all right"
- Candy-coloured clown.

739
01:24:30,102 --> 01:24:32,889
I close my eyes

740
01:24:34,606 --> 01:24:37,891
Then I drift away

741
01:24:38,567 --> 01:24:41,485
Don't be a good neighbour to her.

742
01:24:42,613 --> 01:24:45,364
I'll send you a love letter.

743
01:24:45,823 --> 01:24:48,528
Straight from my heart, fucker!

744
01:24:49,619 --> 01:24:52,027
Do you know what a love letter is?

745
01:24:52,122 --> 01:24:55,205
It's a bullet from a fuckin' gun, fucker.

746
01:24:56,584 --> 01:25:00,913
You receive a love letter from me,
you are fucked for ever!

747
01:25:01,756 --> 01:25:03,713
You understand, fuck?

748
01:25:06,843 --> 01:25:10,045
- I'll send you straight to hell, fucker!
-  In dreams

749
01:25:10,137 --> 01:25:12,130
I walk

750
01:25:12,223 --> 01:25:15,306
-  With you
- In dreams...

751
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:18,848
- I walk with you.
-  In dreams

752
01:25:18,937 --> 01:25:24,477
-  I talk to you
- In dreams... I talk... to you.

753
01:25:25,777 --> 01:25:30,853
-  In dreams you're mine
- In dreams... you're mine.

754
01:25:30,948 --> 01:25:33,735
-  All the time
- All...

755
01:25:33,826 --> 01:25:38,202
We're together

756
01:25:38,287 --> 01:25:43,329
-  In dreams, in dreams
- For ever in dreams.

757
01:25:45,878 --> 01:25:47,953
But just

758
01:25:48,256 --> 01:25:51,422
Before the dawn

759
01:25:54,678 --> 01:25:59,387
-  I awake and find
- Feel this.

760
01:25:59,474 --> 01:26:01,348
You gone

761
01:26:03,937 --> 01:26:05,727
I can't help it

762
01:26:06,062 --> 01:26:08,305
I can't help it

763
01:26:08,398 --> 01:26:11,352
If I cry

764
01:26:11,443 --> 01:26:14,064
Feel my muscles. Huh?

765
01:26:14,571 --> 01:26:18,022
Feel 'em! Huh? You like that?

766
01:26:19,992 --> 01:26:22,281
Hold him tight for me.

767
01:26:24,956 --> 01:26:27,528
Frank, stop it!

768
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:32,166
Frank, stop it! Frank! Stop!

769
01:26:35,839 --> 01:26:39,505
Frank, stop it! Stop it!

770
01:26:41,554 --> 01:26:44,127
Stop it, Frank!

771
01:26:49,477 --> 01:26:54,139
In dreams you're mine

772
01:27:43,693 --> 01:27:44,892
Hit me.

773
01:28:09,508 --> 01:28:11,251
No, Donny, Mama loves you!

774
01:28:32,821 --> 01:28:35,774
What do you mean,
you're lucky to be able to call me?

775
01:28:35,865 --> 01:28:37,656
Things got out of hand.

776
01:28:39,576 --> 01:28:44,737
I know some things. They could help your
father, but you might get into trouble.

777
01:28:45,207 --> 01:28:48,207
Look, forget me. You've got to tell him.

778
01:28:48,585 --> 01:28:52,535
OK. I promise I won't mention you.

779
01:28:53,089 --> 01:28:56,837
Jeffrey, I mean it. It doesn't matter.

780
01:28:57,509 --> 01:29:00,843
- Good. I'll see you Friday, if not before.
- OK.

781
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:03,005
- Bye-bye, Sandy.
- Bye.

782
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:21,815
I don't wanna talk about it.

783
01:29:21,907 --> 01:29:26,402
Everything is OK now.
I just don't wanna talk about it.

784
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:31,535
Sometimes it's good to talk things over.
For instance, they say many marriages...

785
01:29:31,623 --> 01:29:35,751
Aunt Barbara...
I love you but you're gonna get it.

786
01:30:07,489 --> 01:30:09,149
Gordon.

787
01:30:09,365 --> 01:30:13,529
Gordon went right up to 'em in broad
daylight, cos he's the man, right?

788
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:17,747
He took those drugs away
and it was beautiful.

789
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:53,355
I got it.

790
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:58,693
- Jeffrey. Come on in.
- Jeffrey.

791
01:31:00,537 --> 01:31:03,408
- Hi, Sandy.
- Hi, Jeffrey.

792
01:31:03,498 --> 01:31:08,705
- Sorry to bother you, but I need to talk.
- OK. Looks like you had a bad face-lift.

793
01:31:08,795 --> 01:31:11,582
- Yeah.
- Come on into my study.

794
01:31:16,843 --> 01:31:21,304
I have to show you some photos
and tell you some things about them.

795
01:31:24,309 --> 01:31:26,798
This is the first picture.

796
01:31:27,811 --> 01:31:29,270
It's Frank Booth.

797
01:31:31,064 --> 01:31:33,936
He is a very sick and dangerous man.

798
01:31:34,652 --> 01:31:37,651
His address is on the back of the photo.

799
01:31:38,946 --> 01:31:44,533
This photo is of Frank and another man
as they went into Frank's building.

800
01:32:01,259 --> 01:32:06,596
And then that man came out and met
with a third man. This well-dressed guy.

801
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:09,515
Here's that photo.

802
01:32:13,186 --> 01:32:17,646
I think a woman named Dorothy Vallens
is in trouble with these people.

803
01:32:17,732 --> 01:32:21,895
I think Frank kidnapped her husband
and son. I have no hard proof of this.

804
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:28,862
- Is Sandy part of this?
- Oh, no. No.

805
01:32:31,452 --> 01:32:34,074
Who else knows you have these photos?

806
01:32:34,163 --> 01:32:37,532
Just you and the photo lab.

807
01:32:37,624 --> 01:32:40,910
- And you're through with this now?
- Yes, sir, I am.

808
01:32:44,673 --> 01:32:49,547
For now, all right, you better be. And
Sandy better not be involved with this.

809
01:32:54,807 --> 01:32:59,219
Be prepared to come in
for further interrogation on this later.

810
01:32:59,310 --> 01:33:01,434
Yes, sir.

811
01:33:09,821 --> 01:33:14,566
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah. Is Friday still on?

812
01:33:14,658 --> 01:33:18,525
- You didn't tell him about me?
- No.

813
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:21,739
Why did I ever
get you going on this, Jeffrey?

814
01:33:25,210 --> 01:33:29,337
- Of course Friday's still on.
- Great. See ya then.

815
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,669
Good night, Detective Williams.

816
01:33:37,261 --> 01:33:40,013
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Jeffrey.

817
01:33:49,439 --> 01:33:51,515
Dad?

818
01:33:51,608 --> 01:33:53,316
What's wrong?

819
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,899
There better be nothin' wrong.

820
01:34:56,584 --> 01:34:58,659
- I'll get it.
- OK, thanks.

821
01:35:03,047 --> 01:35:05,455
- Jeffrey, come on in.
- Thanks, Mrs Williams.

822
01:35:05,550 --> 01:35:07,838
- She's all ready.
- OK.

823
01:35:09,428 --> 01:35:12,050
- You look great.
- Thanks.

824
01:35:13,307 --> 01:35:16,011
- Hello, Detective Williams.
- Hello, Jeffrey.

825
01:35:16,102 --> 01:35:17,761
- You all set?
- Almost.

826
01:35:18,353 --> 01:35:21,022
Hey, John, get a move on.

827
01:35:26,611 --> 01:35:29,101
Just a minute, Tom.

828
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:32,603
Easy does it, Jeffrey.

829
01:35:33,867 --> 01:35:37,319
Behave yourself. Don't blow it.

830
01:35:38,997 --> 01:35:41,832
Come on, John. Get it in gear, pal.

831
01:35:41,916 --> 01:35:45,249
So long, Jeffrey.
You two have a nice time tonight, OK?

832
01:35:45,336 --> 01:35:47,956
- OK.
- What's goin' on?

833
01:35:48,046 --> 01:35:50,418
Just a little fatherly advice.

834
01:35:50,507 --> 01:35:52,499
That's right, Jeffrey.

835
01:35:52,593 --> 01:35:54,585
Come on.

836
01:35:54,678 --> 01:35:56,469
Bye, Dad.

837
01:35:56,554 --> 01:36:00,338
- Good night, Mom.
- Bye. Have a good time.

838
01:36:00,432 --> 01:36:03,433
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Tom.

839
01:36:09,608 --> 01:36:13,688
- Jeffrey, what was that all about?
- It's nothing.

840
01:36:13,779 --> 01:36:15,854
Really.

841
01:36:16,615 --> 01:36:18,689
It's good to see you.

842
01:36:19,115 --> 01:36:21,607
It's good to see you.

843
01:36:27,791 --> 01:36:29,866
You look beautiful.

844
01:36:32,712 --> 01:36:33,827
Thank you.

845
01:36:41,804 --> 01:36:43,879
Hi.

846
01:37:08,118 --> 01:37:10,609
- It's all taken care of.
- OK.

847
01:37:11,289 --> 01:37:12,948
You want a drink?

848
01:37:15,543 --> 01:37:17,830
Wanna dance?

849
01:37:18,962 --> 01:37:21,037
Yeah.

850
01:37:29,888 --> 01:37:37,018
Sometimes a wind blows

851
01:37:38,229 --> 01:37:45,856
And you and I

852
01:37:46,446 --> 01:37:53,028
Float

853
01:37:53,619 --> 01:38:01,957
In love

854
01:38:02,626 --> 01:38:09,672
And kiss for ever

855
01:38:10,174 --> 01:38:17,506
In a darkness

856
01:38:18,849 --> 01:38:24,887
And the mysteries of love

857
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:27,056
I love you, Jeffrey.

858
01:38:27,233 --> 01:38:30,932
Come clear

859
01:38:31,026 --> 01:38:33,518
I love you, too.

860
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:42,074
In you

861
01:38:44,081 --> 01:38:47,663
In me

862
01:38:48,167 --> 01:38:52,116
And show

863
01:38:52,212 --> 01:38:55,380
That we

864
01:38:56,258 --> 01:39:04,301
Are love

865
01:39:12,856 --> 01:39:15,561
Bye. See you later.

866
01:39:59,231 --> 01:40:02,980
- What's goin' on?
- What is it?

867
01:40:03,694 --> 01:40:05,401
They're gonna hit us.

868
01:40:06,905 --> 01:40:09,230
- Oh, my God, what's wrong?
- It's Frank.

869
01:40:16,664 --> 01:40:18,325
Move it!

870
01:40:18,416 --> 01:40:20,491
Hang on.

871
01:40:23,295 --> 01:40:26,580
I can't outrun this guy.
My father's got a gun at home.

872
01:40:26,674 --> 01:40:29,757
- Jeffrey, no.
- Sandy, this guy's a killer. I promise you.

873
01:40:34,763 --> 01:40:38,512
It's Mike! Jeffrey, it's Mike.
Oh, my God.

874
01:40:46,692 --> 01:40:50,937
Get outta the car!
Come on! Get outta there!

875
01:40:51,028 --> 01:40:54,361
You stole my girl, you bastard.
I'm gonna kick your ass.

876
01:40:54,448 --> 01:40:57,782
Right here, in front of your own
stupid house. Get outta here!

877
01:40:57,868 --> 01:40:59,527
Mike, stop it.

878
01:40:59,619 --> 01:41:03,948
Shut up! Just shut up, all right?
Nobody's talkin' to you.

879
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:07,540
Come on, Mike. Look, I don't
wanna cause any problems.

880
01:41:08,461 --> 01:41:11,081
- Who's that? Is that your mother?
- Dorothy.

881
01:41:11,171 --> 01:41:15,383
- No, come here, you lvy League shit.
- She's hurt, in case you didn't notice.

882
01:41:15,467 --> 01:41:17,958
Dorothy Vallens?

883
01:41:25,727 --> 01:41:27,684
Come on.

884
01:41:36,111 --> 01:41:39,276
I'm really... Hey, I'm sorry.

885
01:41:41,532 --> 01:41:44,486
I'm really sorry.
I didn't know. I'm really sorry.

886
01:41:44,577 --> 01:41:48,361
- It's OK. It's OK.
- I thought you were gonna kill him, man.

887
01:41:48,664 --> 01:41:50,406
We've gotta get her outta here.

888
01:41:50,498 --> 01:41:53,499
Go to my house.
My father can get an ambulance fast.

889
01:41:53,584 --> 01:41:57,084
- His partner won't be there, will he?
- Probably not. Why?

890
01:41:57,172 --> 01:42:00,337
- Nothing.
- Watch out for Mike.

891
01:42:01,925 --> 01:42:04,002
Oh, God.

892
01:42:04,094 --> 01:42:06,170
Is that you, Jeffrey?

893
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:08,548
Yeah. It's me.

894
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,596
Oh, Jeffrey...

895
01:42:11,059 --> 01:42:13,134
Jeffrey...

896
01:42:19,441 --> 01:42:21,932
Dad? Mom?

897
01:42:22,277 --> 01:42:25,148
- I'm in here, honey.
- Mom!

898
01:42:25,239 --> 01:42:27,694
All right, I'll be right there.

899
01:42:27,783 --> 01:42:31,862
- Is Dad home?
- No. He oughta...

900
01:42:32,078 --> 01:42:35,114
You better call him.
And... get an ambulance.

901
01:42:35,206 --> 01:42:37,281
Where have you been?

902
01:42:37,374 --> 01:42:39,450
Oh, God.

903
01:42:39,709 --> 01:42:45,130
Oh, God, they've hurt him.
Oh, Jeffrey! Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me!

904
01:42:45,215 --> 01:42:47,540
- Hold me! Hold me!
- It's OK, it's OK.

905
01:42:53,389 --> 01:42:55,464
My secret lover.

906
01:42:57,393 --> 01:43:00,511
I've called for an ambulance.
The police are on their way.

907
01:43:00,603 --> 01:43:02,394
Don't get the police!

908
01:43:03,981 --> 01:43:05,440
Stop it!

909
01:43:06,234 --> 01:43:08,226
I love you! Love me!

910
01:43:11,738 --> 01:43:13,814
He put his disease in me.

911
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:19,029
Tell me it's all right
I opened myself to you.

912
01:43:19,121 --> 01:43:22,820
- Tell me it's all right.
- Sandy, please...

913
01:43:22,915 --> 01:43:26,248
- Sandy?
- I'll get a coat to put on her.

914
01:43:30,296 --> 01:43:33,381
Jeffrey? What's going on here?

915
01:43:33,466 --> 01:43:35,792
I'll tell you.

916
01:43:35,885 --> 01:43:39,219
They... they've hurt his head.

917
01:43:40,222 --> 01:43:42,299
Who, Dorothy?

918
01:43:42,975 --> 01:43:46,059
Don. Help him.

919
01:43:48,064 --> 01:43:49,557
Help him.

920
01:43:50,982 --> 01:43:53,556
Promise me you'll help him!

921
01:44:03,827 --> 01:44:06,365
He put his disease in me.

922
01:44:25,096 --> 01:44:27,670
Would you like to
come in the ambulance?

923
01:44:27,766 --> 01:44:29,840
I'll be right with you.

924
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:39,773
I should go.

925
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:41,935
- Go.
- Sandy...

926
01:44:50,410 --> 01:44:52,736
Hold me! I'm falling!

927
01:44:52,830 --> 01:44:55,665
I'm falling! Hold me!

928
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:07,670
- You lied to me.
- Sandy, please, forgive me.

929
01:45:08,511 --> 01:45:10,717
I love you.

930
01:45:10,804 --> 01:45:13,377
I forgive you, Jeffrey.

931
01:45:18,603 --> 01:45:20,679
I love you.

932
01:45:24,817 --> 01:45:26,893
I love you.

933
01:45:28,947 --> 01:45:32,777
I... But I couldn't watch that.

934
01:45:38,789 --> 01:45:41,789
- Is she OK?
- Yeah, she's OK.

935
01:45:41,874 --> 01:45:45,657
Get your father. Tell him to send
the police to Dorothy's apartment.

936
01:45:45,753 --> 01:45:48,326
Tell him to hurry. I'm leaving right now.

937
01:45:48,422 --> 01:45:51,090
- Jeffrey, no.
- I have to.

938
01:45:51,925 --> 01:45:54,546
- I love you.
- Oh, God, be careful.

939
01:45:54,636 --> 01:45:56,711
I will, believe me.

940
01:46:08,148 --> 01:46:10,223
Where...

941
01:46:12,902 --> 01:46:15,393
Where is my dream?

942
01:46:28,917 --> 01:46:30,992
Look, this is an emergency.

943
01:46:31,085 --> 01:46:35,545
He said someone was hurt
and he wants Detective Williams there.

944
01:46:35,631 --> 01:46:38,336
We do not know his whereabouts
at this time.

945
01:46:38,425 --> 01:46:39,540
Well, find him!

946
01:48:38,117 --> 01:48:40,275
Get back and stay down.

947
01:48:43,163 --> 01:48:45,404
He's going to apartment 26.

948
01:48:47,167 --> 01:48:52,290
Lieutenant, we're at Frank's place now.
The raid has commenced, as scheduled.

949
01:48:56,258 --> 01:48:58,749
Stay in place.

950
01:48:59,136 --> 01:49:02,883
Love letters straight from your heart

951
01:49:02,972 --> 01:49:06,720
Number 25 is vacant,
so maybe we can go through there.

952
01:49:10,271 --> 01:49:12,678
Keep us so near

953
01:49:13,564 --> 01:49:15,474
While apart

954
01:49:21,447 --> 01:49:24,116
I'm not alone

955
01:49:24,616 --> 01:49:27,986
In the night

956
01:49:30,539 --> 01:49:32,614
I'm gonna let them find you on their own.

957
01:49:32,707 --> 01:49:35,791
When I can have

958
01:49:35,877 --> 01:49:38,961
All the love

959
01:49:39,046 --> 01:49:42,580
You write

960
01:49:43,967 --> 01:49:46,838
I memorise

961
01:49:47,638 --> 01:49:49,465
Every line

962
01:51:35,568 --> 01:51:37,145
Detective Williams.

963
01:51:37,237 --> 01:51:41,020
- Detective Williams?
- Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?

964
01:51:41,115 --> 01:51:44,448
Yeah, it's me. I'm hiding
in Dorothy Vallens' apartment.

965
01:51:44,535 --> 01:51:49,327
Frank is on his way in a well-dressed-man
disguise. I've got no way out...

966
01:51:50,207 --> 01:51:51,617
He's got a radio.

967
01:51:53,459 --> 01:51:54,490
Jeffrey!

968
01:51:58,673 --> 01:52:03,049
Detective Williams?
I'm hiding in the back bedroom.

969
01:52:03,134 --> 01:52:05,210
Please hurry.

970
01:52:17,648 --> 01:52:24,017
Hey, neighbour. You shit-for-brains, man!
You forgot I have a police radio!

971
01:52:27,783 --> 01:52:34,234
One well-dressed fuckin' man knows
where your fuckin' cute little butt's hidin'.

972
01:52:35,205 --> 01:52:37,281
Stupid fuck.

973
01:52:38,542 --> 01:52:40,748
Fuck with me, man.

974
01:52:51,762 --> 01:52:55,925
Here I come, ready or not.

975
01:53:01,854 --> 01:53:04,309
You fuck!

976
01:53:04,399 --> 01:53:08,348
I can hear your fuckin' radio,
you stupid shit!

977
01:53:09,070 --> 01:53:13,896
You got about one fuckin'
second to live, buddy!

978
01:53:13,990 --> 01:53:18,070
You're one sorry piece of shit, mister.

979
01:53:24,791 --> 01:53:27,745
Hey, pretty, pretty!

980
01:53:36,302 --> 01:53:40,051
What the fuck... Where are you?
Where are you?

981
01:54:48,117 --> 01:54:50,323
Oh, Jeffrey.

982
01:54:58,460 --> 01:55:00,950
It's all over, Jeffrey.

983
01:55:43,792 --> 01:55:51,087
And kiss for ever

984
01:55:51,341 --> 01:55:58,636
In a darkness

985
01:56:00,141 --> 01:56:07,518
And the mysteries of love

986
01:56:07,981 --> 01:56:16,652
Come clear

987
01:56:16,738 --> 01:56:23,819
And dance

988
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:31,954
In light

989
01:56:33,711 --> 01:56:35,455
In you

990
01:56:36,297 --> 01:56:39,916
- Jeffrey, lunch is ready.
- OK.

991
01:56:41,928 --> 01:56:45,510
In me

992
01:56:45,890 --> 01:56:49,722
And show

993
01:56:50,019 --> 01:56:51,477
That we...

994
01:56:51,562 --> 01:56:54,182
- How you guys doin'?
- Hey, Jeffrey.

995
01:56:54,272 --> 01:56:59,017
- Hey, Jeff. Feelin' much better now, Jeff.
- Good deal, Dad.

996
01:57:01,154 --> 01:57:03,609
Sandy, look.

997
01:57:09,036 --> 01:57:10,233
Lunchtime.

998
01:57:10,329 --> 01:57:12,452
- OK, Jeffrey.
- Sounds good.

999
01:57:12,539 --> 01:57:16,121
Jeffrey, come over here and look at this.

1000
01:57:17,293 --> 01:57:19,333
Look.

1001
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,376
Yeah, I saw him outside.

1002
01:57:23,007 --> 01:57:25,579
Maybe the robins are here.

1003
01:57:26,926 --> 01:57:31,506
I don't see how they could do that.
I could never eat a bug.

1004
01:57:33,974 --> 01:57:36,548
It's a strange world.

1005
01:57:37,103 --> 01:57:39,179
Isn't it?

1006
01:57:44,359 --> 01:57:51,026
Sometimes a wind blows

1007
01:57:52,158 --> 01:57:59,239
And the mysteries of love

1008
01:57:59,957 --> 01:58:07,666
Come clear

1009
01:58:32,737 --> 01:58:38,489
And I still can see

1010
01:58:38,575 --> 01:58:41,944
Blue velvet

1011
01:58:43,204 --> 01:58:45,529
Through

1012
01:58:45,622 --> 01:58:47,911
My

1013
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,164
Tears
