{9998}{10041}Hey, what are you doing?
{10043}{10101}You're supposed to be|upstairs sleeping.
{10103}{10166}Stanley keeps waking me up.
{10168}{10241}Oh, ho, ho. I get it.
{10243}{10288}Boy, are you getting heavy.
{10290}{10360}Don't let her pull more|than her usual nonsense.
{10362}{10421}Two stories,|two glasses of water.
{10423}{10492}Jack, you're going|to miss the plane.
{10494}{10552}OK. Cricket,|you listen to me.
{10554}{10637}Go upstairs with Mrs. Wheeler now|and go to sleep.
{10639}{10672}On my business trip,
{10674}{10720}I'll get Stanley|a little brother.
{10722}{10757}Will you promise?
{10759}{10788}I promise.
{11584}{11625}Can I get you anything, sir?
{11652}{11694}No, thank you very much.
{11696}{11755}If you try and get sleep,
{11756}{11801}the flight will go faster.
{11803}{11873}I can never sleep on a plane.
{11875}{11907}Turbulence.
{11908}{11940}Pardon?
{11942}{11989}Turbulence...
{11991}{12037}Solar radiation|heats the Earth's crust,
{12039}{12085}warm air rises,|cold airs descends.
{12087}{12141}Turbulence.|I don't like that.
{12143}{12196}Oh. Well, try to sleep anyway.
{13108}{13139}Dr Ryan?
{13548}{13622}Jack, boy,|get yourself in here.
{13624}{13671}Jesus!|You look like hell.
{13672}{13719}Thank you very much, Admiral.
{13720}{13747}Want coffee?
{13748}{13794}I think I need some coffee.
{13796}{13878}I'm not going to ask you|how your flight went.
{13880}{13950}When's the last time|you got some sleep?
{13952}{13986}Oh, I don't know.
{13988}{14046}This thing's still|on London time.
{14048}{14082}Milk and sugar?
{14084}{14119}Milk and sugar.
{14120}{14154}So how's Caroline?
{14156}{14202}Last time I saw her
{14204}{14286}was at your granddad's place|in Maine, wasn't it?
{14288}{14355}She's fine.|Sends you her best.
{14356}{14388}And Sally?
{14390}{14418}She's fine.
{14420}{14492}What is she now, 3?
{14494}{14581}Ah, no, she's|a very precocious 5.
{14583}{14667}She announced to Caroline|and I the other day
{14668}{14738}that her life would be|considerably less lonely
{14740}{14822}if we were to buy her|a baby brother.
{14824}{14882}But she decided|it would be enough
{14884}{14954}if we were to|buy one for Stanley.
{14982}{15012}Who's Stanley?
{15014}{15068}Uh... Stanley's a bear.
{15136}{15164}All right.
{15166}{15230}What's important enough|to get you on a plane
{15232}{15270}in the middle of the night?
{15272}{15349}British lntelligence obtained|these pictures two days ago.
{15351}{15385}She's the Red October,
{15387}{15429}the latest typhoon class.
{15431}{15477}Big son of a bitch.
{15479}{15542}12 meters longer than|the standard typhoon.
{15544}{15577}3 meters wider.
{15579}{15628}The captain's name is Ramius.
{15630}{15653}One of yours?
{15655}{15704}Yeah. I did his bio last year.
{15706}{15752}He's taken out the lead boat
{15754}{15824}in each new sub class|for 10 years.
{15826}{15860}Fairly good|political connections.
{15862}{15932}Trained most of their|attack boat skippers.
{15934}{16011}The Russians call him|Vilnius Nastavnic...
{16012}{16098}the Vilnius schoolmaster.
{16124}{16158}What are these doors?
{16160}{16255}Those doors, sir, are the problem.
{16256}{16286}I don't know what they are.
{16288}{16322}Neither do the British.
{16324}{16358}Perhaps our friends in Murmansk
{16360}{16406}have come up with something new.
{16408}{16490}With your permission,|I'd like to show these to someone.
{16492}{16519}Do you know Skip Tyler?
{16520}{16548}Sub driver.
{16550}{16623}Was. Clipped by a drunk driver.|Lost his leg.
{16624}{16672}He's teaching at the academy,
{16673}{16701}consulting for Navy labs.
{16703}{16728}Clearance?
{16730}{16768}Top secret or better.
{16793}{16855}Margie, have a car for Dr Ryan
{16856}{16904}downstairs in 10 minutes.
{17002}{17048}A satellite caught Red October
{17049}{17103}in Polijarny lnlet this morning.
{18079}{18125}Do you hear it?
{18154}{18184}No.
{18186}{18215}Beaumont, at Cal Tech
{18216}{18280}we used to do this|in our sleep.
{18282}{18321}You hear it now?
{18323}{18358}Wait a minute.
{18360}{18387}Maybe.
{18388}{18412}Um...
{18414}{18461}It's buried in surface clutter?
{18463}{18500}Yes.
{18502}{18549}I should go to SAPS?
{18551}{18597}Correct, Seaman Beaumont.
{18599}{18657}Signal algorithmic|processing systems.
{18659}{18693}Give it a week,
{18695}{18757}and you'll be|teaching at Cal Tech.
{18794}{18825}So...
{18827}{18923}Iike Beethoven on the computer,
{18924}{18979}you have labored to produce...
{19134}{19173}a biologic.
{19222}{19250}A what?
{19252}{19311}A whale, Beaumont.|A whale...
{19312}{19345}A marine mammal
{19347}{19427}that knows a hell|of a lot more about sonar
{19429}{19461}than you do.
{19463}{19496}Kill the SAPS.
{19497}{19586}Train over to 2-6-9|and let's try it again.
{19588}{19647}If he gets to ragging|on you too bad,
{19649}{19707}ask him about Pavarotti.
{19708}{19754}We don't have time|for sea stories.
{19756}{19827}I was in the middle|of teaching Seaman Beaumont
{19829}{19876}the intricacies|of modern sonar. Now...
{19877}{19931}I ain't chief of the boat.
{19932}{19975}I'm Sheena,|Queen of the Jungle.
{19977}{20003}Cob, please.
{20004}{20035}Come on, Cob. Tell me.
{20036}{20101}OK. Fine. Go ahead.
{20103}{20151}Ahem... Seaman Jones here,
{20153}{20209}he's into music in a big way.
{20211}{20257}He figures this whole boat
{20259}{20315}is basically just his own
{20316}{20384}personal, private stereo set.
{20386}{20431}He gets this|piece of Pavarotti...
{20432}{20456}Paganini.
{20458}{20480}Whatever.
{20482}{20504}Paganini.
{20506}{20540}This is my story, OK?
{20541}{20611}Tell it right.|Pavarotti's a tenor.
{20612}{20649}Paganini was a composer.
{20651}{20709}OK. So he's got this music,
{20711}{20782}and he's got it out|in the water.
{20784}{20830}He's listening|on his headsets,
{20832}{20863}happy as a clam.
{20864}{20894}Then all hell breaks loose.
{20896}{20953}A slew of boats|out of San Diego...
{20955}{20990}Including one|way out at Pearl.
{20992}{21039}Including one|way out at Pearl.
{21040}{21090}All of a sudden,|they start hearing...
{21092}{21117}- Pavarotti.|- Pavarotti...
{21119}{21175}coming out of their asses.
{21218}{21271}What do I do?
{21272}{21311}I got it.
{21371}{21440}Conn. Sonar.|New contact, bearing 0-9-7.
{21442}{21500}Designate contact|number Sierra 3-5.
{21502}{21548}Captain, aye.|What've you got, Jones?
{21550}{21585}Distant contact,|probably submerged.
{21587}{21620}It's a wild guess,
{21622}{21681}but I'd say we hit a boomer
{21683}{21716}coming out of the barn.
{21718}{21784}Could be a missile boat|out of Polijarny.
{21786}{21818}OK. Start your track.
{21820}{21862}I'll be there in a minute.
{21864}{21907}Sonar, aye.
{25090}{25142}...Armageddon.
{25144}{25202}And the seventh angel|poured forth his bowl
{25204}{25238}into the air,
{25240}{25298}and a voice cried out|from heaven, saying,
{25300}{25344}"It is done".
{25395}{25441}A man with your responsibilities
{25443}{25506}reading about the end|of the world. Huh.
{25508}{25541}And what's this?
{25543}{25600}"I am become death,
{25602}{25672}the destroyer of worlds".
{25674}{25732}It is an ancient Hindu text
{25734}{25769}quoted by an American.
{25771}{25794}American?
{25796}{25853}Mmm.|He invented the atomic bomb,
{25855}{25920}and he was later accused|of being a Communist.
{25922}{26003}You wrote and underlined|these passages?
{26043}{26069}No.
{26140}{26197}This book belonged to my wife.
{26199}{26246}I keep it|for sentimental value.
{26248}{26293}I'm sorry, comrade Captain.
{26295}{26341}Your wife was...|a beautiful woman.
{26343}{26390}Her death was... unfortunate.
{26392}{26439}I'm only doing my job.
{26440}{26479}It is my responsibility.
{26548}{26639}How many agents did the KGB|put aboard my boat?
{26641}{26676}Your boat, Captain?
{26678}{26708}Yes.
{26710}{26791}This vessel belongs to|the people of the Soviet Union.
{26792}{26896}Besides, if the KGB or the GRU|has agents aboard,
{26898}{26971}I will be the last to know.
{27012}{27087}I suggest we open|our orders, Captain.
{27121}{27159}Certainly, comrade.
{28189}{28229}"From commander...
{28231}{28270}strategic submarine forces
{28272}{28319}red banner northern fleet".
{28321}{28449}We're to proceed north|to grid square reference 54-90
{28451}{28543}and rendezvous with|alfa submarine Konovalov.
{28544}{28588}Captain Tupolev's boat.
{28590}{28625}You know Tupolev?
{28627}{28685}I know he descends|from aristocracy
{28687}{28762}and that he was your student.
{28764}{28808}It's rumored he has|a special place
{28810}{28843}in his heart for you.
{28845}{28935}There's little room in Tupolev's heart|for anyone but Tupolev.
{29034}{29121}Having made contact,|we are to run a series of drills.
{29123}{29194}Tupolev will hunt us|while we test our ship.
{29196}{29232}Having evaluated|the operational readiness
{29233}{29268}of the caterpillar drive,
{29269}{29316}we are to return to Polijarny
{29317}{29378}on or about the 16th|of this month.
{29414}{29473}Captain, this is|an historic moment.
{29475}{29520}I'd like to make a request.
{29522}{29557}Before you proceed, comrade...
{29559}{29596}I know it's not protocol,
{29598}{29648}but would you permit me|to post our orders
{29650}{29712}and inform the crew|of our mission?
{29857}{29883}Aah!
{30311}{30351}Where I'm going...
{30352}{30403}you cannot follow.
{31094}{31182}Dr Petrov, report|to my cabin immediately.
{31184}{31233}There's been|a dreadful accident.
{31957}{31983}Hey, buddy!
{32204}{32258}Daniel, got any more rods?
{32260}{32287}More rods!
{32288}{32353}Listen to me.|There's no cradle underneath it.
{32355}{32388}Get it over.
{32390}{32436}Relax!|Stop being an old maid.
{32438}{32508}You want to come up here|and do it yourself?
{32510}{32544}All right. Bring her up.
{32546}{32572}What? What?
{32603}{32632}Ryan!
{32634}{32668}Who let you in here?
{32670}{32698}Hey, Skip,
{32700}{32768}what, have they got you|playing with models now?
{32770}{32800}Ahh!
{32802}{32835}Damn it, Bill!
{32837}{32885}Tell them to slow down!
{32887}{32933}I'm doing it.|I'm doing it.
{32935}{32969}Calm down, will you?
{32971}{33039}It's not a model. The DSRV.
{33041}{33064}Rescue sub.
{33066}{33100}I know what it is.
{33102}{33153}What are you doing with it?
{33155}{33213}We're rigging it|with a generic docking collar
{33215}{33261}so it'll mate with|British, German...
{33263}{33295}just about anybody's sub.
{33296}{33352}We can get it|anywhere in the world
{33354}{33387}in 24 hours.
{33420}{33455}How's your back?
{33457}{33505}It's fine.
{33507}{33566}Have you got a minute?
{33599}{33657}Bigger than|a regular typhoon.
{33683}{33718}What are these doors?
{33720}{33777}You don't miss much, do you?
{33779}{33853}Those are too big|to be torpedo tubes.
{33888}{33941}Would you launch|an ICBM horizontally?
{33943}{33990}Sure. Why would you want to?
{33992}{34043}They're symmetrical.
{34070}{34130}Right down|the long axis of the sub.
{34132}{34197}How about a towed sonar array?
{34199}{34261}Nope.|Too close to the screws.
{34263}{34292}I'll be...
{34356}{34379}This...
{34380}{34416}This could be a caterpillar.
{34417}{34441}A what?
{34443}{34483}Uh, a caterpillar drive.
{34484}{34542}Magneto-hydrodynamic propulsion.
{34544}{34575}You follow?
{34576}{34602}No.
{34604}{34685}It's like a...|a jet engine for the water.
{34687}{34738}Goes in the front,|gets squirted out the back.
{34740}{34786}Only it's got no moving parts,
{34788}{34833}so it's very, very quiet.
{34835}{34889}Like how quiet?
{34891}{34962}It's doubtful our sonar|would even pick it up.
{34964}{34997}And if it did,
{34999}{35045}it would sound|like whales humping
{35047}{35082}or a seismic anomaly.
{35084}{35118}Anything but a submarine.
{35120}{35195}We messed with this|a couple of years ago.
{35197}{35238}Couldn't make it work.
{35261}{35296}They really built this?
{35298}{35361}This isn't a mock-up|or anything?
{35363}{35420}She put to sea this morning.
{35558}{35591}When I was 12,
{35593}{35676}I helped my daddy build|a bomb shelter in our basement
{35677}{35735}because some fool parked|a dozen warheads
{35737}{35821}90 miles off the|coast of Florida.
{35823}{35893}This thing could park|a couple of hundred warheads
{35895}{35929}off Washington and New York,
{35931}{35989}and no one would know|anything about it
{35991}{36033}until it was all over.
{36309}{36369}Are you all right, Captain?
{36371}{36399}Oh, yes.
{36401}{36459}It's just to die for something
{36461}{36515}as petty as slipping on tea.
{36517}{36575}You're blaming yourself, Captain.|It was an accident.
{36577}{36635}You'll feel better|when we put in.
{36637}{36662}Put in?
{36664}{36703}Well, to base, Captain.
{36705}{36763}We cannot go on without|a political officer.
{36765}{36848}Doctor, this is a combat vessel|of the Soviet Navy,
{36849}{36907}and I'm a senior combat officer.
{36909}{36990}We do not cancel operations|because of accidents.
{37028}{37058}Seaman.
{37060}{37114}Come here.
{37116}{37176}Come here.
{37178}{37217}Your name?
{37219}{37260}Cook's Assistant, Loginov, sir.
{37262}{37374}Good. I want you and the doctor|to witness this.
{37376}{37426}I'm removing|the political officer's...
{37428}{37459}missile key...
{37460}{37491}carry on...
{37492}{37542}and I'm keeping it myself.
{37544}{37591}Captain, I think|we should report this
{37592}{37637}to Red Fleet Command.
{37639}{37668}I'm afraid|that's impossible, Doctor.
{37670}{37728}Our orders are|for strict radio silence.
{37730}{37766}Orders, sir.
{37768}{37802}That's all, Loginov.
{37804}{37826}Yes, sir.
{37828}{37905}This is most unnerving,|Captain.
{37907}{37990}The reason for having|two missile keys
{37992}{38067}is so that no one man...
{38069}{38093}may...
{38095}{38149}May what?
{38179}{38219}May arm the missiles.
{38221}{38267}Perhaps I should keep the key.
{38269}{38316}Thank you.|That'll be all, Doctor.
{38318}{38340}Captain, l...
{38342}{38383}When I address the crew,
{38384}{38443}then you will understand.
{38444}{38474}Yes, sir.
{38536}{38565}Petrov.
{38567}{38593}Yes, sir?
{38595}{38654}I will try to forget|your comments
{38656}{38716}when I present my report.
{38718}{38756}Thank you, sir.
{38886}{38986}Holding steady on 3-1-0.
{38988}{39034}12 knots|at about 20,000 yards.
{39036}{39093}Have you got a make on him?
{39095}{39130}Computer's chewing on it, sir.
{39132}{39157}Twin screws.
{39159}{39223}The plant noise|sounds like a typhoon.
{39440}{39504}I'd say we got|a new boat, sir.
{39506}{39573}Tommy, I miss something|on the boards?
{39575}{39622}Sub plant hasn't said|anything about it.
{39624}{39649}Hmm.
{39696}{39721}All right.
{39723}{39780}How many typhoons|we got in the computer?
{39782}{39804}Six, sir.
{39806}{39853}OK. Call this guy|Typhoon Seven.
{39855}{39888}Start a tape on him.
{39890}{39948}See if we can work|in a little closer.
{39950}{39994}Yes, sir.
{39996}{40030}Won't he hear us?
{40032}{40103}Not if we stay in his baffles,|Seaman Beaumont.
{40105}{40164}Not if we stay in his baffles.
{40166}{40202}Come in behind his propeller,
{40204}{40263}and he's deaf as a post.
{40947}{41011}Any sonar contacts,|Mr. Kamarov?
{41013}{41076}No contacts, Captain.|The sonar is clear.
{41078}{41147}Good. Do we have any|surface contacts, Mr. Borodin?
{41148}{41207}No contacts, sir.|Scope is clear.
{41208}{41256}Good. Then it is time
{41257}{41320}I explain our orders|to the crew.
{41351}{41412}Comrades, this is your captain.
{41414}{41483}It is an honor|to speak to you today,
{41485}{41544}and I'm honored|to be sailing with you
{41546}{41579}on the maiden voyage
{41581}{41629}of our motherland's|most recent achievement.
{41631}{41751}And once more,|we play our dangerous game,
{41753}{41793}a game of chess,
{41795}{41854}against our old adversary...
{41856}{41896}the American Navy.
{41898}{41932}For 40 years,
{41934}{42010}your fathers before you|and your older brothers
{42012}{42074}played this game|and played it well.
{42076}{42143}But today,|the game is different.
{42145}{42206}We have the advantage.
{42208}{42268}It reminds me of the heady days
{42270}{42304}of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin,
{42306}{42388}when the world trembled|at the sound of our rockets.
{42390}{42436}Well, they will tremble again
{42438}{42484}at the sound of our silence.
{42486}{42556}The order is engage|for silent drive.
{42558}{42585}Aye, sir.
{42587}{42641}Ballast control,|open outer doors.
{42643}{42677}Yes, open outer doors.
{42679}{42704}Diving command.
{42706}{42765}Engage caterpillar|and secure main engines.
{42876}{42916}Doors opening, Captain.
{42918}{42952}Comrades, our own fleet
{42954}{43025}doesn't know|our full potential.
{43027}{43091}They will do everything|possible to test us,
{43093}{43163}but they will only test|their own embarrassment.
{43165}{43223}We will leave our fleet behind.
{43225}{43284}We will pass through|the American patrols,
{43286}{43326}pass their sonar nets,
{43328}{43395}and lay off their largest city
{43397}{43465}and listen|to their rock 'n' roll
{43467}{43540}while we conduct missile drills.
{43542}{43593}Then...
{43595}{43627}And when we are finished,
{43628}{43674}the only sound they will hear
{43676}{43714}is our laughter
{43716}{43761}while we sail to Havana,
{43763}{43848}where the sun is warm|and so is the comradeship.
{43901}{43950}Cryogenic plant|coming on line, Captain.
{43952}{44013}A great day, comrades.
{44015}{44061}We sail into history.
{44220}{44260}Caterpillar engaging.
{44332}{44393}Caterpillar engaging,|Captain.
{44737}{44765}What happened?
{44767}{44802}I don't know.
{45439}{45473}Full rudder left.
{45475}{45510}Full rudder left.
{45512}{45534}Navigator.
{45536}{45601}New course, 2-5-0.
{45603}{45650}Yes, new course, 2-5-0.
{45652}{45683}Steering 2-5-0.
{45684}{45727}Yes, course is 2-5-0.
{46490}{46525}Sonar contact, Captain.|Port quarter.
{46527}{46555}Close aboard.
{46557}{46587}American,
{46589}{46627}Los Angeles class.
{46651}{46687}American. Captain, we...
{46689}{46751}Course 3-1-0.
{46753}{46833}Is the American|turning to follow us?
{46835}{46867}No, Captain.
{46869}{46944}The American is continuing|in his original course.
{46946}{46987}He's continuing northwest.
{46989}{47036}He can't hear us.
{47038}{47087}And the singing?
{47422}{47463}Let them sing.
{47936}{47986}What are you talking about?|Check your gear.
{47988}{48026}Running diagnostics now,|Captain.
{48175}{48232}Sonar is working, Captain.
{48234}{48270}The Russian disappeared.
{48272}{48307}One minute, he was steady
{48308}{48343}4,000 yards off the bow,
{48344}{48381}and then he was gone,
{48383}{48475}and for a second,|I thought I heard...
{48476}{48531}Heard what?
{48532}{48593}I thought I heard singing, sir.
{48630}{48659}Singing?
{48661}{48695}Yes, sir.
{49037}{49064}Yah, yah.
{49130}{49171}Yah, yah, yah.
{49245}{49279}Yah, yah.
{49362}{49395}Good morning, sir.
{49397}{49455}I hope we had a lovely evening.
{49457}{49483}Yah, yah.
{49485}{49535}A little chilly this morning.
{50104}{50177}There's a letter there|from Marko Ramius.
{50232}{50277}Ah, Marko.
{51042}{51075}Yes?
{51077}{51127}No. This is Dr Ryan.
{51231}{51266}What the hell happened?
{51268}{51293}Come on.
{51295}{51365}This is no longer|a research project.
{51430}{51500}I got a line on those doors.
{51539}{51585}You know what they are?
{51638}{51707}A nearly silent|propulsion system?
{51708}{51755}How did you know that?
{51756}{51827}The captain of the sub|following her radioed in.
{51828}{51887}Thing disappeared|right in front of him,
{51888}{51947}and that's only|the half of it.
{51948}{51975}Read.
{52135}{52172}Oh! I'm sorry.
{52209}{52238}Got your I.D.?
{52240}{52290}My God, this is unbelievable.
{52292}{52355}The Kirov, three Sverdlovs,
{52357}{52396}the Kiev, the Minsk.
{52398}{52444}They've sortied|their whole bloody fleet.
{52446}{52492}That's about the size of it.
{52494}{52528}Good afternoon, Admiral.
{52530}{52551}Afternoon, Matthew.
{52552}{52602}Where are we going anyway?
{52604}{52654}Briefing for Jeffrey Pelt,
{52655}{52712}President's National|Security Adviser.
{52714}{52779}Most of the Joint Chiefs|will be there,
{52781}{52835}along with a few other people.
{52837}{52877}Who's giving the briefing?
{52879}{52904}You are.
{52906}{52968}The yeoman will|have all the slides
{52970}{53004}Iaid out for you.
{53006}{53048}So all you got to do...
{53166}{53208}Look.
{53210}{53280}No one understands|this material better than you.
{53282}{53340}Just give him|a rundown on the sub
{53342}{53411}and a precis of the|stuff in your hand.
{53413}{53474}He's liable to ask|some direct questions.
{53475}{53508}Give him direct answers.
{53510}{53550}Tell him what you think.
{53579}{53608}Come on.
{53650}{53692}Ahem.
{53694}{53720}Ahem.
{53750}{53809}Uh, gentlemen,|the last 24 hours
{53811}{53898}have seen some extraordinary|Soviet naval activity.
{53900}{53971}The first to sail|was this ship,
{53972}{54019}we believe|called the Red October
{54020}{54082}in reference to|the October Revolution of 1917.
{54084}{54143}A variant|of the typhoon class,
{54145}{54191}she's some 650 feet long
{54192}{54252}and 32,000 tons|submerged displacement...
{54254}{54288}roughly the same size
{54290}{54361}as a World War Il|aircraft carrier.
{54363}{54408}We believe that these doors,
{54410}{54480}here on the bow|and again on the stern,
{54482}{54529}enclose a unique|propulsion system...
{54531}{54604}a magneto-hydrodynamic drive,|or caterpillar,
{54606}{54689}that would enable the sub|to run virtually silent.
{54691}{54752}It is possible|that this new drive system
{54754}{54813}allowed the captain,|a man named Ramius,
{54815}{54873}their senior and perhaps|most respected commander...
{54875}{54922}Do we have|his picture available?
{54923}{54991}Allowed Ramius to elude|one of our attack boats,
{54993}{55075}the Dallas, which trailed Red October|from harbor this morning.
{55118}{55152}It is also possible
{55154}{55212}that this drive system,|if operable,
{55214}{55260}could render the Red October
{55262}{55321}undetectable to|our Sosus warning nets
{55323}{55356}in the Atlantic.
{55358}{55416}Mr. Ryan, would you|characterize this
{55418}{55468}as a first-strike weapon?
{55538}{55597}Uh, that is a possibility, sir.
{55599}{55657}It is designed|to approach by stealth
{55659}{55692}and to shower its target
{55694}{55728}with multiple|independent warheads
{55730}{55781}with little or no warning|before impact.
{55783}{55866}Goddamn thing's made|to start a war.
{55890}{55925}Proceed, Mr. Ryan.
{55927}{55996}About the same time|the Dallas lost contact,
{55998}{56033}there were additional sailings
{56035}{56107}from Polijarny and from|Leningrad on the Baltic
{56109}{56151}and from the Mediterranean.
{56153}{56217}There are now|some 58 nuclear submarines
{56219}{56280}headed at high speed|into the Atlantic.
{56282}{56346}This afternoon a satellite pass|over Polijarny
{56347}{56408}found heat blooms|in the engineering plants
{56410}{56449}at the Kirov, the Minsk,
{56451}{56509}and more than 20 other|cruisers and destroyers,
{56511}{56564}indicating they were|preparing to sail.
{56566}{56642}This constitutes the bulk|of the Soviet surface fleet.
{56643}{56678}Admiral Greer,|your conclusions.
{56679}{56711}Well, sir,
{56712}{56782}the data support|no conclusions as yet.
{56783}{56851}The absence of activity|in the Pacific
{56853}{56911}suggests this could|be just an exercise.
{56913}{56960}It may have nothing to do...
{56962}{57008}Suppose it's not an exercise?
{57010}{57043}Suppose this|is the beginning
{57045}{57079}of a move against NATO?
{57081}{57127}NSA can speak for that,|Mr. Pelt.
{57129}{57204}I must emphasize the extreme|sensitivity of this information
{57206}{57264}and that it not leave the room.
{57266}{57300}Before sailing, Captain Ramius
{57302}{57364}sent a letter|to Admiral Yuri Padorin,
{57366}{57401}Chairman of the Red Fleet
{57403}{57444}northern political directorate.
{57446}{57481}That's her uncle.
{57483}{57524}Whose uncle?
{57526}{57561}Ramius' wife.
{57563}{57612}Padorin's her uncle.
{57614}{57704}Now, the contents|of the letter are unknown,
{57706}{57772}but Admiral Padorin|immediately demanded
{57774}{57825}a meeting|with Premier Chernenko,
{57827}{57884}and within minutes|of that meeting,
{57886}{57919}the Soviet fleet sailed
{57921}{57980}with orders|to find Red October
{57982}{58020}and sink her.
{58050}{58076}Sink her?
{58078}{58136}My God. They've got|a madman on their hands.
{58138}{58204}If it gets within|500 miles of the coast,
{58206}{58276}we'll have less than|two minutes' warning.
{58636}{58677}Today's the 23rd, isn't it?
{58679}{58702}What?
{58703}{58729}Is today the 23rd?
{58731}{58753}Yeah.
{59011}{59066}You son of a bitch.
{59094}{59164}You son of a bitch!
{59234}{59278}You wish to add something
{59279}{59319}to our discussion, Dr Ryan?
{59450}{59500}Well, sir,|I was just thinking
{59502}{59576}that perhaps there's another|possibility we might consider.
{59615}{59669}Ramius might be|trying to defect.
{59671}{59698}Do you mean to suggest
{59699}{59735}that this man has come...
{59736}{59779}Proceed, Mr. Ryan.
{59851}{59881}Well...
{59883}{59945}Ramius trained most|of their officer corps,
{59947}{60005}which would put him|in a position
{60007}{60077}to select men|willing to help him.
{60079}{60117}And he's not Russian.
{60141}{60177}He's Lithuanian by birth,
{60179}{60249}raised by his paternal|grandfather, a fisherman.
{60251}{60349}And he has no children,|no ties to leave behind.
{60415}{60480}And today is|the first anniversary
{60482}{60515}of his wife's death.
{60517}{60563}Come on.|You're just an analyst.
{60565}{60618}How can you read his mind?
{60619}{60658}I know Ramius, General.
{60659}{60731}He's nearly a legend|in the submarine community.
{60732}{60786}He's been a maverick|his entire career.
{60787}{60854}I actually met him once|at an embassy dinner.
{60855}{60917}Have you ever met|Captain Ramius, General?
{61128}{61162}Admiral Hollis,
{61163}{61246}how long before Ramius|could be in a position
{61248}{61307}to fire his missiles at us?
{61308}{61338}Four days.
{61339}{61398}All right.|I'll brief the President.
{61399}{61452}That will be all, gentlemen.
{61454}{61486}Dr Ryan,
{61487}{61574}would you stay|for a moment, please?
{61575}{61650}I said speak your mind,|Jack, but Jesus...
{61936}{62027}You slammed the door|on the general pretty hard, Jack.
{62028}{62087}That was not my intention, sir.
{62088}{62123}Oh, yes, it was.
{62124}{62158}He was patronizing you,
{62159}{62206}and you stomped on him.
{62207}{62266}In my opinion,|he deserved it.
{62267}{62318}Listen, I'm a politician,
{62319}{62378}which means I'm|a cheat and a liar,
{62379}{62430}and when I'm|not kissing babies,
{62432}{62470}I'm stealing|their lollipops,
{62471}{62596}but it also means|that I keep my options open.
{62598}{62746}So let's assume for a minute|that you're right
{62748}{62810}and this Russian|intends to defect.
{62835}{62898}What do you suggest|we do about it?
{62943}{62989}We definitely|grab the boat, sir.
{62991}{63041}Hey, wait a minute.
{63043}{63123}We're not talking about|some stray pilot with a M.I.G.
{63125}{63183}We're talking about several|billion dollars' worth
{63185}{63219}of Soviet state property.
{63221}{63267}They're going to want it back.
{63269}{63303}Maybe it's enough then
{63304}{63375}just to get some people|onboard and inspect it.
{63377}{63423}Call it whatever|you want to...
{63425}{63472}a Coast Guard|safety inspection.
{63474}{63539}So how do we proceed?
{63541}{63575}First, we need to contact
{63576}{63647}the commanders|in the Atlantic directly.
{63648}{63695}The Russians get|one whiff of this
{63696}{63735}through the regular|communications circuits,
{63737}{63771}the game is up.
{63773}{63843}Second, we figure out|how we can help them.
{63845}{63891}We devise a plan to intercede,
{63893}{63951}ready to go at a moment's notice.
{63953}{64025}Third, somebody's got to|go make contact with Ramius
{64027}{64093}and find out what|his intentions really are.
{64095}{64124}OK.
{64126}{64159}When do you leave?
{64161}{64196}Ha ha ha!
{64198}{64247}Wait a minute.
{64278}{64312}The general was right.
{64314}{64347}I am not field personnel.
{64349}{64383}I am only an analyst.
{64385}{64411}You're perfect.
{64413}{64480}I can't ask any|of these characters to go.
{64482}{64516}They don't believe in it.
{64518}{64555}They'd never stake|their reputation
{64557}{64591}on a hunch, whereas you...
{64593}{64627}Are expendable.
{64686}{64723}Something like that.
{64805}{64852}I'll give you three days
{64854}{64899}to prove your theory correct.
{64901}{64935}After that,
{64937}{65019}I have to hunt down Ramius|and destroy him.
{65021}{65067}Will you do it?
{65462}{65509}Mother of God!
{65511}{65548}Secure the mast!
{65550}{65584}All ahead, 2/3!
{65586}{65620}Set depth to 900 meters!
{65622}{65668}What is it?|What's happened?
{65670}{65719}Mast secured, helm at 2/3.
{65758}{65815}Commence heading 2-0-5.
{65817}{65875}2-0-5, affirmative.
{66195}{66263}These orders|are seven bloody hours old!
{66265}{66300}Sitting on the bottom
{66302}{66335}Iike an addled schoolboy.
{66337}{66360}Captain...
{66362}{66384}Passing at...
{66386}{66411}All ahead, flank.
{66413}{66439}All ahead, flank.
{66441}{66491}Inquire of the engineer|about the possibility
{66581}{66627}Seven hours.
{66629}{66691}The entire fleet is after him.
{66908}{66944}Leveling at 900 meters.
{66946}{66972}Very well.
{66974}{67019}Captain, Engineer reports
{67082}{67119}but not recommended.
{67381}{67444}Go to 105 on the reactor.
{67514}{67547}Captain, what is it?
{67549}{67583}Where are we going?
{67585}{67647}We're going to|kill a friend, Yevgeni.
{67668}{67732}We're going to kill Ramius.
{68252}{68287}If you like borscht,|perhaps,
{68288}{68346}but I've eaten better|in an oiler's galley.
{68347}{68392}My wife said to the waiter,
{68394}{68453}"Where did this man|learn to cook,
{68455}{68478}Afghanistan?"
{68479}{68546}So then we went|on to the Bolshoi,
{68547}{68576}the ballet,
{68578}{68630}to see this new girl|as Giselle.
{68632}{68670}You remember|how beautiful she was.
{68671}{68718}She just married|a factory manager.
{68719}{68753}Excuse me, Doctor.
{68755}{68801}Do you have the figures
{68803}{68874}for the latest batch|of radiation tests?
{68875}{68901}Now?
{68923}{68957}Now.
{68995}{69081}Perhaps you could bring|the preceding set as well...
{69103}{69137}for comparison.
{69163}{69201}Thank you, Doctor.
{69631}{69693}It will take him some time.
{69719}{69782}Before we begin, Captain,
{69783}{69817}I'd like to know
{69819}{69863}exactly what happened|to Putin.
{69987}{70058}He didn't slip|on his tea, did he?
{70087}{70145}I don't think I like|your tone, Slavin.
{70147}{70229}What the hell's my tone|got to do with it?
{70231}{70265}We're risking our lives here.
{70267}{70325}Putin could've caused|complications.
{70327}{70386}Did you think he would|just go away and sulk
{70387}{70434}while we carried out our plans?
{70435}{70489}Are you saying|he was murdered?
{70491}{70529}My God.
{70531}{70565}Stop whining, Yuri.
{70567}{70601}How can you justify murder?
{70603}{70638}So he was murdered.
{70639}{70690}The man was a pig,
{70692}{70759}but it's a decision|we should've all made together.
{70760}{70795}You are not in command here.
{70796}{70865}If the crew finds out,|we could have a mutiny.
{70867}{70903}What are you talking about?
{70905}{70939}They could kill us all.
{70940}{71011}Everything that happens|on this ship affects us all.
{71013}{71071}The Master-At-Arms|is already suspicious.
{71072}{71107}We could still go back.
{71108}{71162}There will be no going back.
{71212}{71246}Before we sailed,
{71247}{71350}I dispatched a letter|to Admiral Padorin,
{71351}{71413}in which I announced|our intention...
{71415}{71452}to defect.
{71490}{71560}In the name of God, why?
{71562}{71620}When he reached the New World,
{71622}{71680}Cortez burned his ships.
{71682}{71767}As a result, his men|were well motivated.
{71769}{71836}You have signed|our death warrants.
{71838}{71909}Padorin will send|the entire fleet.
{71911}{71944}Jesus, they'll find us.
{71946}{71977}They'll find us and...
{71979}{72021}No one's going to find us.
{72023}{72060}That's enough, Yuri.
{72090}{72130}You had to do it, huh?
{72131}{72202}You couldn't just|turn the submarine over
{72203}{72238}to the Americans.
{72239}{72310}You had to make|a political statement.
{72311}{72396}Or was it something|deeper, Captain...
{72398}{72489}something that made you|unable to slip away?
{72491}{72557}Was it ego, Captain?
{72559}{72629}We each have|our reasons, Victor.
{72631}{72664}My own began
{72666}{72761}the day I was handed|the blueprints for this ship...
{72763}{72833}a ship which had but one use.
{72835}{72880}And as for the rest,
{72882}{72952}well, those are things|that I alone
{72954}{73000}must carry the burden for.
{73002}{73109}Anatoli,|you're afraid of our fleet.
{73111}{73155}Well, you should be.
{73157}{73260}Personally, I give us|one chance in three.
{73350}{73401}More tea, anyone?
{73473}{73514}No?
{73542}{73620}Then you may report|back to your posts.
{74023}{74088}You heard the Captain.|Dismissed.
{74311}{74351}Captain.
{74634}{74693}Captain, I would never|disagree with you
{74695}{74764}in front of the men,|you know that.
{74766}{74848}But in this case,|Victor is right.
{74870}{74905}It would've been better
{74907}{74964}if you had not informed Moscow.
{74966}{74994}Oh, Vasily.
{74995}{75058}Moscow is not the worry,
{75059}{75121}nor the whole Soviet Navy.
{75123}{75181}I know their tactics.
{75183}{75237}I have the advantage.
{75279}{75309}No.
{75331}{75393}The worry is the Americans.
{75423}{75490}If we meet the right sort,
{75491}{75545}this will work.
{75603}{75697}We get some buckaroo...
{75807}{75866}Some turbulence,|eh, Commander?
{75867}{75926}You don't like flying, huh?
{75927}{75961}Oh, this is nothing!
{75963}{75997}You should've been with us
{75999}{76033}five, six months ago!
{76035}{76072}Oh! You talk about puke!
{76074}{76144}We ran into a hailstorm|over the sea of Japan, right?
{76146}{76198}Everybody's retching|their guts out!
{76200}{76249}The pilot shot his lunch
{76251}{76273}all over the windshield,
{76275}{76333}and I barf on the radio!
{76335}{76362}Knocked it out completely,
{76363}{76411}and it wasn't|that lightweight stuff either!
{76412}{76472}It was that chunky,|industrial-weight puke!
{76474}{76510}You want a bite?
{76511}{76583}Jack, next time|you get a bright idea,
{76584}{76653}just put it in a memo.
{76859}{76883}Sir.
{76920}{76982}That'll be all, Lieutenant.|Thank you.
{76983}{77031}That hawkeye|from Weymouth Trap?
{77032}{77054}Four wire.
{77055}{77115}Caught a gust over the fantail.
{77116}{77150}Well, not bad, considering.
{77151}{77223}The gentleman|is here to see you.
{77224}{77250}The gentleman?
{77251}{77293}What the hell|you talking about, Charlie?
{77295}{77340}I apologize|for the uniform, sir.
{77342}{77380}This is Admiral Greer's idea
{77382}{77415}of a low profile.
{77417}{77463}You work for Jim Greer?
{77464}{77499}That's right, sir.
{77501}{77559}Then I imagine you'll tell me
{77560}{77603}what all the hubbub's about.
{77630}{77676}Captain, you got a minute?
{77678}{77712}Jonesy's got something
{77714}{77759}I think you ought to see.
{77761}{77816}Martinez, get yourself|a cup of coffee.
{77818}{77858}Send me up some tea.
{77860}{77883}Aye, Captain.
{77885}{77976}Messenger,|get the captain a cup of tea.
{78027}{78064}Captain.
{78098}{78168}Sir, the moment|that sub went silent
{78170}{78227}and I thought I|heard some singing,
{78229}{78288}I heard something|in the background real faint.
{78290}{78336}After all those subs took off,
{78338}{78420}I caught it again|and got it on tape.
{78422}{78468}I washed it through the computer
{78470}{78529}and was able to|isolate this sound.
{78578}{78636}When I asked the computer|to identify it,
{78638}{78696}what I got was|magma displacement.
{78698}{78756}You see, sir,|the SAPS software
{78758}{78828}was originally written|to look for seismic events.
{78830}{78877}I think when it gets confused,
{78879}{78932}it kind of runs home to Mama.
{78934}{78967}I'm not following you,|Jonesy.
{78969}{79006}Sir, I'm sorry.
{79007}{79092}Listen to it|at 10 times speed.
{79263}{79343}Now, that's got to|be manmade, Captain.
{79344}{79363}All right.
{79419}{79478}The first contact was at 09:15,
{79479}{79525}and the bearing was 2-6-9.
{79527}{79574}At 09:30, it was here.
{79576}{79659}I came back to it at 11:00|and 11:15, here and here.
{79660}{79707}Remember the dispatch we got
{79708}{79739}about Russian sub skippers
{79741}{79801}running the Reykjanes Ridge|at high speeds
{79803}{79847}because they had|hyper-accurate surveys
{79849}{79884}of the underwater canyons?
{79886}{79931}The front door to those canyons
{79933}{79991}was a formation|called Thor's Twins.
{79993}{80022}Yeah?
{80329}{80361}Look at that.
{80422}{80460}Right into Red Route One.
{80462}{80483}Captain.
{80521}{80555}You may think I'm crazy,
{80557}{80603}but I'll bet that|magma displacement
{80605}{80663}was actually some|new Russian sub,
{80665}{80718}and it's headed|for the lceland coast.
{80773}{80832}Have I got this straight,|Jonesy?
{80834}{80927}A $40 million computer tells you|you're chasing an earthquake,
{80929}{80963}but you don't believe it,
{80965}{81047}and you come up|with this on your own?
{81049}{81075}Yes, sir.
{81077}{81111}Including all the navigation math?
{81113}{81148}Sir, I've got all the...
{81150}{81199}Relax, Jonesy. You sold me.
{81233}{81327}Tommy, I want you|to plot us a speed course
{81329}{81399}for the bottom end|of Red Route One.
{81401}{81451}We'll never find him|in those canyons.
{81453}{81507}First take us|to periscope depth.
{81509}{81538}This we got to phone in.
{81539}{81591}Aye, aye, Captain.
{81798}{81839}Hang on, Jonesy.
{81953}{82019}If I can get you close enough,
{82021}{82058}can you track this sucker?
{82059}{82099}Yes, sir.
{82101}{82171}Now that I know|what to listen for,
{82173}{82211}I'll bag him.
{82237}{82263}Carry on.
{82265}{82294}Yes, sir.
{82332}{82384}That's the craziest notion|I've ever heard...
{82386}{82412}a serving line officer?
{82414}{82460}An entire ballistic|missile submarine?
{82462}{82497}They can't all want to defect.
{82499}{82544}Even if it's only the officers,
{82546}{82581}it's extremely|difficult to believe.
{82583}{82616}What's his plan?
{82618}{82646}His plan?
{82648}{82707}Russians don't take a dump, son,
{82708}{82753}without a plan.
{82755}{82821}Senior captains don't start|something this dangerous
{82823}{82863}without having thought|the matter through.
{82865}{82891}What's he going to do,
{82893}{82968}sail into New York, pop the hatch,|and say here I am?
{82970}{83017}It might be just|that simple, yes.
{83019}{83070}Things may appear simple|in the cubicle at CIA,
{83072}{83126}but in the middle|of the Atlantic
{83128}{83185}with Soviet warships|bearing down on us,
{83187}{83219}they get more complex.
{83220}{83243}Smoke?
{83245}{83295}No, thank you.
{83297}{83340}And I don't think your notion
{83342}{83400}of a few days inspection's|going to wash either.
{83402}{83460}In order to be of any value,
{83462}{83497}you'd have to tear it apart.
{83499}{83537}The metallurgy would|take a couple of months.
{83539}{83569}Then we'd have to keep it.
{83571}{83653}What will you do with the crew?
{83655}{83757}Ones that don't defect will go back|and say we got the boat.
{83759}{83807}Or do you plan|to eliminate them?
{83837}{83886}We're not at war, sir.
{83887}{83986}So you have to get them|off the boat in such a way
{83987}{84034}that they think we don't have it,
{84035}{84119}and they'll report that|we don't have it to their bosses.
{84121}{84154}Otherwise, this whole business
{84155}{84202}is just academic, right?
{84239}{84309}Yes, sir.|I think I see your point.
{84348}{84403}When's the last time you slept?
{84456}{84489}A while.
{84515}{84578}The chief outside|will fix you up.
{84579}{84615}Thank you, sir.
{84616}{84652}Captain.
{84771}{84829}It'll be dawn|in a couple of hours.
{84831}{84863}We'll be in the CIC.
{84865}{84942}Things are liable to get|a little dicey around here.
{84974}{85012}Yes, sir.
{85195}{85238}You think he's crazy?
{85240}{85268}Certifiable.
{85270}{85309}No matter what|his credentials,
{85311}{85380}I don't care for him|wearing the uniform.
{85382}{85439}Did you see that ring|on his finger?
{85440}{85511}The academy, class of '72.|A marine.
{85512}{85538}You're kidding.
{85540}{85575}How did you...
{85577}{85611}Greer told me.
{85612}{85652}Summer of his third year,
{85654}{85711}he went down|in a chopper accident.
{85713}{85759}Bad. Pilot and crew killed.
{85761}{85831}That kid spent|10 months in traction
{85833}{85904}and another year|learning to walk again.
{85906}{85969}He did his fourth year|from the hospital.
{85993}{86039}It's up to you, Charlie,
{86041}{86132}but you might consider|cutting the kid a little slack.
{86134}{86203}Ah, Russians are|going to find that sub
{86205}{86267}before we get near it anyway.
{86793}{86852}Passing Thor's Twins, sir.
{86854}{86883}Very good.
{87003}{87048}Passing the twins now,|Captain.
{87050}{87095}Very good.|You may commence your run.
{87097}{87143}Call me at the first turning.
{87145}{87180}Aye, Captain.
{87182}{87219}Mr. Kamarov.
{87245}{87292}You may commence your run now.
{87294}{87316}Aye, sir.
{87318}{87401}First leg on my mark,|course 2-6-0.
{87403}{87508}Speed, 18 knots.|Depth, 270 meters.
{87510}{87546}5...
{87547}{87571}4...
{87572}{87596}3...
{87598}{87620}2...
{87622}{87655}1...
{87656}{87691}Mark.
{87693}{87752}Diving command, course 2-6-0.
{87754}{87788}Course 2-6-0, aye.
{87790}{87816}Speed, 18 knots.
{87818}{87852}Speed, 18 knots, aye.
{87854}{87888}Stop pissing, Yuri.
{87890}{87944}Give me a stopwatch and a map,
{87946}{87980}and I'll fly the Alps
{87982}{88016}in a plane with no windows.
{88018}{88080}If the map is accurate enough.
{88585}{88655}We're in the lane|and approaching first turn.
{88657}{88760}Come left to course 1-9-5.
{88762}{88808}In 30 seconds,
{88810}{88855}decrease depth to 200 meters.
{88857}{88892}Maintain speed.
{88894}{88931}Very good, Navigator.
{88977}{89036}Captain, we're approaching|the first turn.
{89038}{89095}25 seconds to course 1-9-5.
{89097}{89165}Increase speed to 26 knots|and recompute.
{89241}{89275}Aye, Captain.
{89313}{89387}Navigator, recompute|for 26 knots.
{89422}{89468}Turn on my mark.
{89470}{89599}5... 4... 3... 2... 1...
{89601}{89623}Mark.
{89625}{89671}Diving control,|come left to 1-9-5.
{89673}{89707}Come left to 1-9-5.
{89709}{89738}Up on the bow planes.
{89927}{89970}Course now 1-9-5
{89971}{90054}and maintaining speed|26 knots.
{90148}{90195}Mr. Kamarov?
{90196}{90242}Next leg, Captain,
{90243}{90350}come right|to course 2-4-0 now at...
{90351}{90399}8 minutes and 40 seconds.
{90400}{90474}Very good.|Maintain course and speed.
{90555}{90602}Too fast, Vasily.
{90603}{90627}Too fast.
{90628}{90698}Those charts are|laid out precisely...
{90699}{90770}so many knots|for so many seconds.
{90771}{90830}And this thing|handles like a pig.
{90831}{90890}Watch your bearing,|Mr. Slavin.
{91041}{91094}15 seconds to turn, Captain.
{91095}{91134}Should we decrease speed?
{91135}{91159}Negative.
{91160}{91217}Prepare to come right.
{91219}{91246}Aye, sir.
{91248}{91271}8...
{91272}{91297}7...
{91299}{91321}6...
{91323}{91346}5...
{91348}{91371}4...
{91372}{91395}3...
{91396}{91418}2...
{91419}{91454}1...Mark.
{91455}{91515}15 degrees down angle|on the bow planes.
{91516}{91570}Come right 2-4-0.
{91571}{91602}Move it!
{92068}{92101}We're in the lane.
{92103}{92178}Next leg 34 minutes|to the Neptune Massif.
{92179}{92250}Course 2-4-0.
{92549}{92582}What happened?
{92604}{92638}The cryogenic plant!
{92639}{92674}The magnets aren't cooling.
{92675}{92710}Temperature in|the caterpillar
{92711}{92782}is 15 degrees above red line|and rising.
{92783}{92818}It's going to melt.
{92819}{92874}Kill it! Shut it down!
{92980}{93015}Captain?
{93016}{93038}What happened?
{93039}{93086}The cryogenic plant failed.
{93087}{93142}Reactor damage?
{93143}{93182}There was a power spike,
{93183}{93226}but the reactor|scrammed automatically.
{93228}{93276}Was there any|radiation leakage?
{93278}{93313}I don't know yet!
{93315}{93366}How long will it take to fix?
{93367}{93422}I got to find|what's wrong first.
{93423}{93498}Could be the liquid helium|or the superconductors.
{93528}{93566}Captain, we will have to stop
{93567}{93626}until we can repair|the caterpillar unit.
{93627}{93690}Negative.|We'll run on normal propulsion.
{93724}{93782}Captain,|we will not be silent.
{93783}{93832}Make revolutions for 20 knots
{93834}{93906}and engage the propellers.
{93987}{94023}Aye, Captain.
{94024}{94062}Commence engine start-up.
{94063}{94118}He'll get us all killed.
{94239}{94302}The captain knows|what he's doing.
{94323}{94350}Doctor.
{94423}{94466}Naval activities?
{94468}{94521}I have no knowledge of this.
{94523}{94580}But then,|I never was a sailor.
{94581}{94623}Mr. Ambassador,
{94625}{94683}you have nearly|100 vessels operating
{94685}{94733}in the North Atlantic|right now.
{94735}{94784}Your aircraft have dropped|enough sonar buoys
{94786}{94865}that a man could walk|from Greenland to Scotland
{94866}{94909}without getting his feet wet.
{94910}{94955}Shall we dispense with the bull?
{94957}{94991}You make your point
{94993}{95093}as delicately as ever,|Mr. Pelt, but...
{95095}{95150}And what looks like an exercise
{95152}{95197}could be a prelude to war.
{95199}{95231}How can we tell the difference?
{95233}{95327}Prudence demands that we|deploy ships to observe yours.
{95329}{95365}Your government should consider
{95367}{95449}that having|your ships and ours,
{95451}{95497}your aircraft and ours,
{95499}{95605}in such proximity|is inherently dangerous.
{95607}{95697}Wars have begun that way,|Mr. Ambassador.
{95904}{95974}We have lost|one of our submarines.
{95976}{95998}Lost it?
{96000}{96070}We fear she may be down, and...
{96072}{96109}this is most embarrassing, but...
{96111}{96193}several of the officers|are sons of...
{96195}{96275}high party officials.
{96277}{96323}One is even the son
{96325}{96371}of a Central Committee member.
{96373}{96417}I cannot say which.
{96419}{96518}You're telling me this is|a massive rescue operation?
{96520}{96568}That is correct.
{96615}{96686}I'm terribly sorry.
{96688}{96730}How can we help?
{96784}{96823}I'm not sure that...
{96825}{96895}Perhaps a joint rescue mission?
{96963}{97034}That is very gracious of you, sir.
{97036}{97105}I'll pass your offer on.
{97107}{97141}But at this time,
{97143}{97189}I think we're doing everything
{97191}{97231}that can be done.
{97660}{97699}Captain?
{97785}{97853}Our strategy depends|on your answer.
{97854}{97925}The entire fleet|will know where we are.
{97926}{97953}Captain, Sonar.
{97955}{98033}We've been overflown|by a multi-engine turboprop.
{98035}{98084}Put it on audio.
{98166}{98212}Short transients,|close aboard.
{98242}{98289}Water entry of small objects.
{98291}{98333}Sonar buoys.
{98367}{98389}Battle stations.
{98391}{98429}Battle stations!
{98431}{98453}Battle stations!
{98455}{98477}Battle stations!
{98479}{98528}How long to Neptune Massif?
{98576}{98609}How long?
{98611}{98691}4 minutes, 10 seconds.
{98693}{98729}Should we bottom the boat?
{98731}{98766}No. Too late now.
{98768}{98833}We've run out of time.
{98835}{98859}Countermeasures.
{98861}{98894}Prepare to launch missiles.
{98896}{98931}Aye, sir.
{99133}{99169}Aircraft on computer guidance.
{99170}{99209}Request permission to launch.
{99211}{99286}You are authorized|to launch the weapon.
{99340}{99392}Weapon is away.
{99481}{99516}High speed screw!
{99517}{99556}Torpedo in the water!
{99557}{99594}Stand by.
{99626}{99662}Torpedo is active.
{99721}{99772}Torpedo has acquired.
{99773}{99815}Launch countermeasures.
{99817}{99856}Launch countermeasures.|Aye, sir.
{100008}{100041}We're in the lane.
{100043}{100112}How long till|the turn at Massif?
{100113}{100140}2 minutes, 9 seconds.
{100141}{100216}We have no room to maneuver|in these canyons.
{100217}{100252}Shut up.
{100370}{100428}Torpedo has reached|countermeasures.
{100429}{100464}Torpedo has lost contact.
{100465}{100516}Massif approaching.
{100581}{100636}Torpedo has reacquired.
{100637}{100729}Torpedo has reacquired|and is homing.
{100730}{100765}Give me the count.
{100766}{100848}Turn at Massif 40 degrees starboard|in 30 seconds.
{100849}{100898}Time to torpedo impact?
{100900}{100949}Torpedo impact, 35 seconds.
{100951}{100991}Increase to flank.
{100993}{101016}Full ahead flank.
{101017}{101044}Full ahead flank.
{101046}{101076}Full ahead flank, aye.
{101077}{101133}Torpedo impact now 40 seconds.
{101165}{101211}35 seconds.
{101391}{101428}30 seconds.
{101450}{101497}Turn at Massif in...
{101499}{101545}7...
{101546}{101581}6...
{101582}{101617}5...
{101618}{101641}4...
{101642}{101677}3...
{101678}{101704}2...
{101706}{101728}1...
{101729}{101752}Mark.
{101753}{101792}Torpedo impact 25 seconds.
{101794}{101820}The turn, Captain.
{101822}{101846}Not yet.
{101921}{101971}Mark plus 8 seconds...
{101973}{101997}plus 9...
{101999}{102029}plus 10 seconds...
{102030}{102081}plus 11...plus 12...
{102083}{102117}plus 13 seconds...
{102119}{102141}plus 14...
{102143}{102177}plus 15 seconds.
{102178}{102273}Captain, we're out of position|by a boat length.
{102274}{102334}Torpedo impact now 15 seconds.
{102336}{102388}Sound collision.
{102389}{102415}Sound collision.
{102417}{102458}We're out of the lane!
{102460}{102495}You're relieved.
{102497}{102529}Borodin?
{102667}{102698}Right full rudder!
{102700}{102724}Reverse starboard engine!
{102725}{102748}Right full rudder.
{102749}{102777}All back starboard shaft.
{102779}{102820}All back starboard shaft!
{102893}{102956}Torpedo impact 12 seconds...
{102958}{103029}10... 9... 8...
{103031}{103128}7... 6... 5...
{103847}{103909}Captain, they're|really shooting at us!
{103911}{103933}Pull yourself together!
{103935}{103996}Boy! Easy, boy.
{103997}{104072}If they were really|shooting at us,
{104073}{104120}we'd be dead by now.
{104121}{104168}Give me some line.
{104573}{104646}I found out what happened|to the caterpillar.
{104648}{104729}The buffer circuit|has been torn out.
{104731}{104801}It was only a matter of time
{104803}{104857}before an overload|shut it down.
{104858}{104897}What are you saying?
{104899}{104969}Whoever did this knew how|to cripple the caterpillar
{104971}{105018}in a way not easy to find.
{105020}{105093}Captain,|we have a saboteur on board.
{105187}{105257}It can't be any of the officers.
{105259}{105330}They had plenty of time|before we embarked.
{105332}{105378}Must be a crew member.
{105380}{105413}Go to Putin's cabin.
{105415}{105485}Check his files|for information on the crew.
{105487}{105584}We may have to put them off|before we planned.
{105631}{105703}The average Russky, son,|don't take a dump
{105705}{105741}without a plan.
{105788}{105825}Wait a minute.
{105859}{105941}We don't have to get|the crew off the sub.
{105943}{106002}He would have had to do that.
{106004}{106109}We just have to figure out|what he's going to do.
{106111}{106180}How is he going|to get them off the sub?
{106207}{106301}They'd have to want to get off.
{106303}{106362}How do you get a crew
{106364}{106448}to want to get off a submarine?
{106449}{106497}How do you get them|to want to get off
{106498}{106535}a nuclear sub...
{106537}{106600}I know how he's going|to evacuate the sub.
{106602}{106636}Not now, Jack.
{106637}{106708}Yankee One star base,|say again status.
{106709}{106744}Declare an emergency.
{106745}{106792}Declare an emergency.
{106793}{106829}Yankee One,|requesting vectors.
{106830}{106900}Vector 2-7-0 speed is buster.
{106901}{106960}Yankee One's|losing hydraulic pressure.
{106961}{107002}Say again, Yankee One.
{107004}{107065}Bear Foxtrot got too close|to the group.
{107067}{107152}One of the F-14s crowded him,|and they bumped.
{107154}{107189}He's losing hydraulic fluid.
{107190}{107269}They're trying to get him|back aboard now.
{107270}{107305}Busy morning.
{107307}{107346}Hmm.
{107348}{107473}Russian attack subs are now stationed|off every East Coast port.
{107475}{107521}We're up here.
{107522}{107593}The New Jersey|is moving up the coast
{107594}{107677}while the Russians,|aside from over 100 bear foxtrots,
{107678}{107761}have a row of subs|and several surface groups.
{107762}{107796}That's a lot of firepower.
{107797}{107842}For a rescue team, yes.
{107844}{107878}There's something else strange.
{107880}{107952}They're using sonar as if|they're looking for something,
{107954}{107989}but nobody's listening.
{107990}{108025}What do you mean?
{108026}{108113}At their speed they could|run over my daughter's stereo
{108115}{108151}and not hear it.
{108175}{108221}They're not searching|for Ramius.
{108223}{108257}They're driving him.
{108259}{108296}Driving him where?
{108386}{108444}The hounds to the hunters.
{108445}{108517}Your sub captain's going|to make it to America.
{108518}{108601}He's going to die|within sight of it.
{108602}{108697}His wing man kept requesting|permission to fire.
{108698}{108779}Somebody messes up, we'll be|in the biggest naval battle
{108781}{108839}since the Jutland.|Jesus!
{108866}{108925}Water's too cold to eject him.
{108927}{108988}Air boss will try|to bring him aboard.
{108990}{109057}Sir, what's this sub|off by herself?
{109059}{109089}Bart Mancuso's boat.
{109090}{109173}He's going to the bottom|of Red Route One.
{109175}{109209}He's had intermittent contact
{109210}{109292}with a magma displacement.|He's got this...
{109293}{109317}Magma displacement?
{109318}{109369}Is that like a seismic anomaly?
{109371}{109417}I suppose so. Why?
{109418}{109509}Is there a way you could|get me onboard the Dallas?
{109510}{109542}What for?
{109544}{109603}I think Mancuso's found|the Red October.
{109605}{109650}He hasn't found anything, Jack.
{109652}{109686}He's just waiting.
{109688}{109733}Sir, this silent propulsion system
{109735}{109795}could easily be mistaken|for something...
{109797}{109884}The only way to get you|that far north
{109885}{109990}is to use a chopper turned|into a flying gas can.
{109992}{110049}Admiral, Yankee One|is on final.
{110051}{110097}Rescue personnel|are in place.
{110099}{110145}Pick up your left wing.
{110147}{110181}You're drifting left.
{110183}{110217}Power, power!
{110219}{110261}Wave off, wave off!
{110262}{110313}Eject, eject, eject!
{110555}{110578}Fire, fire!
{110580}{110642}Fire on the flight deck!
{110644}{110714}This business will|get out of control,
{110716}{110790}and we'll be lucky|to live through it.
{110832}{110877}Fire on the flight deck.
{110879}{110929}All hands lend assistance.
{111071}{111141}The bird's loaded down|with enough fuel to get you there,
{111143}{111191}but Dallas may not be there.
{111193}{111233}We're trying to reach her.
{111235}{111275}If she's gone deep,|it's dodgey.
{111277}{111338}If you have to ditch...
{111503}{111550}If you have to ditch,
{111552}{111615}don't think about anything|but the survival gear.
{111617}{111649}At this water's temperature,
{111651}{111693}you'll have about four minutes.
{111695}{111741}I'll try to remember that.
{111820}{111901}Next time, Jack,|write a goddamn memo.
{112498}{112569}Diving Officer,|make your depth 6-5-0 feet.
{112571}{112629}Make my depth 6-5-0 feet.
{112631}{112701}Sonar, Conn preceding|below the thermal layer.
{112703}{112737}The captain's sacked out?
{112739}{112761}Yeah.
{112763}{112833}Auxiliaries|proceed 5,000 pounds.
{112835}{112869}What about him?
{112871}{112906}He won't leave.
{112908}{112940}Conn. Sonar, hold.
{112941}{113033}No contacts on bearing 2-9-5.
{113138}{113173}You know...
{113174}{113241}I seen me a mermaid once.
{113242}{113336}I've even seen me|a shark eat a octopus,
{113337}{113420}but I ain't never seen|no phantom Russian submarine.
{114323}{114381}We're emerging|from the route, Captain.
{114382}{114441}I've ordered a routine clearing|of the baffles.
{114443}{114533}We'll be making the first turn|in a few minutes.
{114556}{114593}The caterpillar is operational
{114595}{114669}and appears to be|running normally.
{114711}{114786}The crew know about the saboteur.
{114788}{114833}They are afraid.
{114868}{114944}Well, that could be useful|when the time comes.
{115019}{115125}You know, we could make|the Labrador Coast in 16 hours.
{115127}{115233}Half of them would freeze|before they were rescued.
{115235}{115306}No, it's Massachusetts|or Maine...
{115308}{115352}in 48 hours.
{115353}{115402}Two days.
{115569}{115659}Do you think they will|let me live in Montana?
{115840}{115963}I would think they'll|let you live wherever you want.
{115988}{116022}Good.
{116024}{116095}Then I will live in Montana,
{116097}{116167}and I will marry|a round American woman
{116169}{116206}and raise rabbits,
{116208}{116286}and she will cook them for me,
{116288}{116362}and I will have a pickup truck...
{116392}{116422}or a...
{116452}{116550}possibly even|a recreational vehicle
{116552}{116651}and drive from state to state.
{116672}{116731}Do they let you do that?
{116733}{116755}Yes.
{116757}{116788}No papers?
{116789}{116826}No papers.
{116828}{116868}State to state.
{116869}{116921}All right.|Commence your turn.
{117011}{117049}Well, then...
{117051}{117149}in winter I will live|in Arizona.
{117179}{117257}Actually, I think|I will need two wives.
{117258}{117310}Oh, at least.
{117528}{117602}Possible aspect change|on target.
{117604}{117638}Sonar, Conn. Aye.
{117640}{117713}Concur possible target zig|based on bearing rate.
{117786}{117824}Conn! Sonar! Crazy lvan!
{117825}{117861}All stop! Quick quiet!
{117862}{117896}All stop, aye.
{117897}{117936}Engine's all stopped.
{118069}{118112}What's going on, Jonesy?
{118113}{118169}Russian captains|sometimes turn suddenly
{118171}{118241}to see if anyone's behind them.
{118243}{118289}We call it Crazy lvan.
{118291}{118361}The only thing|you can do is go dead,
{118362}{118448}shut everything down, and make|like a hole in the water.
{118449}{118488}So what's the catch?
{118490}{118540}Catch is a boat this big
{118542}{118589}doesn't exactly stop on a dime.
{118590}{118625}If we're too close,
{118626}{118687}we'll drift right|into the back of him.
{118766}{118857}What about you?|What do you look forward to?
{119103}{119140}I...
{119142}{119201}I have no such appetites.
{119234}{119313}Now, let's see if he can hear us.
{119430}{119500}Well, there must be something.
{119678}{119716}What is it?
{119739}{119781}Ahh.
{119814}{119909}I miss...|the peace of fishing
{119910}{119989}Iike when I was a boy.
{120054}{120135}40 years I have been at sea.
{120157}{120217}A war at sea.
{120257}{120327}A war with no battles.
{120365}{120403}No monuments.
{120453}{120495}Only casualties.
{120589}{120663}I widowed her|the day I married her.
{120745}{120852}My wife died while I|was at sea, you know.
{121297}{121355}Post guards|in the engineering spaces.
{121357}{121415}If he can get|to the caterpillar,
{121417}{121494}he can get to somewhere|more vital.
{121549}{121598}Where is he, Jonesy?
{121600}{121627}Conn, Sonar.
{121629}{121704}Target is now coming out|of our starboard baffles.
{121706}{121786}My read is that he|is returning to base course.
{121788}{121869}Concur. He's returning|to course 2-1-0.
{121871}{121933}He went right around us.
{121935}{121993}We'll give him|another 30 seconds,
{121995}{122061}then secure from silent running.
{122084}{122109}Captain?
{122135}{122209}Here's what we got|on the E.L.F.
{122231}{122253}Thanks.
{122255}{122285}Aye, sir.
{122463}{122501}What is it?
{122560}{122641}You're not going|to believe this.
{122932}{122979}Commander,|we are approaching no return.
{122981}{123024}Dallas apparently|hasn't gotten the message.
{123025}{123083}We have to turn back|for the carrier.
{123085}{123127}Give it a couple more minutes.
{123129}{123183}Negative. Fuel status|says we turn around now.
{123185}{123244}Fuel status?|You got a reserve, don't you?
{123245}{123287}I've got a 10-minute reserve,
{123289}{123357}but I'm not allowed to invade that|except during war.
{123359}{123413}If you don't get me|on that submarine,
{123414}{123443}you might have it.
{123445}{123497}You got 10 minutes|worth of fuel.
{123499}{123557}We stay here 10 more minutes.
{123665}{123703}Yo! Mount up!
{123705}{123756}Yo, I got a submarine|at around 3:00.
{123757}{123793}About 2 miles.
{123841}{123885}OK, Tony, hook him up.
{123886}{123962}I'll be lowering you down|to the submarine now.
{123964}{123997}Give me eight minutes.
{123999}{124081}Let's hope this thing|runs on fumes.
{124083}{124132}Very well.|Surface the ship.
{124133}{124167}Whoever this guy is,
{124169}{124225}he's in for one hell of a ride.
{124226}{124315}OK, Commander,|go ahead and sit down.
{124317}{124363}You ever do this before?
{124365}{124419}Once. On a calm day...|off Hawaii.
{124421}{124487}The pilot will have|a difficult time keeping steady.
{124489}{124523}Don't take chances|getting grounded.
{124525}{124571}Keep that rod in front of you.
{124573}{124603}In air like this,
{124605}{124656}the rotors will put out|enough static electricity
{124657}{124688}to light up Chicago.
{124689}{124724}That's why I joined the Navy.
{124725}{124768}A diver's in the escape trunk
{124769}{124823}in case this guy|goes in the drink.
{124825}{124881}Someone must have|a burr up his ass
{124882}{124928}to go for a stunt like this.
{125369}{125419}All right. Ready! Ready!
{125421}{125480}Get your hook up!
{125482}{125555}Commander, if I got|to bring you back up,
{125557}{125605}I'm going to shake the wire.
{125607}{125680}I'll give you a thumbs up,|like this.
{125682}{125730}Remember to cross your arms.
{125732}{125807}Got it? OK. Out you go.|Passenger's out the door.
{125973}{126040}Passenger's halfway down,|drifting forward.
{126041}{126068}Start forward.
{126167}{126247}All right, Tommy.|Get the hook on his cable.
{126249}{126295}On his cable. Now, watch it.
{126297}{126351}Don't touch him.|OK, here he comes.
{126473}{126512}Oh, no!
{126514}{126577}It would be easier|without that bloody crosswind.
{126579}{126625}Where is he?|I can't see him.
{126677}{126707}Don't touch him!
{126741}{126792}Jack! Jack! Jack!
{126837}{126885}This is never going to work.
{126887}{126925}OK, reel him back in.
{127122}{127169}Tony, what's going on back...
{127277}{127347}What happened? Dallas,|have you got a swimmer standing?
{127349}{127384}Emergency stop! Man overboard!
{127385}{127460}Port side!|Send out the diver!
{127462}{127524}Very well, Dallas.|We are history.
{127737}{127779}Get the doc down here!
{127781}{127840}I'll be in the escape trunk.
{127909}{127995}Down ladder! Down ladder!|Make a hole!
{128065}{128124}Watch his head.|Watch his head.
{128381}{128427}How do you do, Captain?
{128429}{128479}It's a pleasure to be aboard.
{128553}{128613}I have to talk to the President.
{128641}{128732}Of course.|May I inquire as to the subject?
{128763}{128823}It seems that the initial reports
{128825}{128896}that one of our submarines|was missing
{128897}{128933}were not completely accurate.
{128979}{129025}The submarine in question
{129027}{129109}is commanded|by Captain Marko Ramius.
{129110}{129162}Apparently, he has suffered
{129164}{129245}a kind of mental|nervous breakdown.
{129279}{129330}Just before he sailed,
{129332}{129413}he posted a letter|to Admiral Yuri Padorin
{129415}{129497}in which he announced|his intention to...
{129547}{129628}to fire his missiles|on the United States.
{129629}{129720}Why didn't you tell me this|the last time we met?
{129721}{129772}In my position|I'm sometimes compromised
{129773}{129849}by the fact Moscow doesn't|always tell me everything.
{129851}{129932}So one of your submarine captains|has gone insane?
{129933}{129988}What do you want from us?
{129989}{130024}You offered your assistance.
{130025}{130060}That was a rescue mission.
{130061}{130108}Now you want us to help you
{130109}{130157}hunt him down and kill him.
{130158}{130192}I have been instructed
{130193}{130271}to ask your President|for precisely that.
{130294}{130351}Find him?|We already found him.
{130353}{130408}We had to break off|to pick you up.
{130409}{130445}Captain, excuse me.|Coffee?
{130446}{130469}Thank you.
{130470}{130493}Cigarette?
{130494}{130516}Don't smoke.
{130517}{130563}Assuming we can find him,
{130565}{130648}just what exactly|am I supposed to do about it?
{130649}{130674}Captain, radio.
{130676}{130708}We're receiving|flash traffic
{130709}{130757}on the V.L.F.|emergency circuit.
{130758}{130808}Very well. Bring it down.
{130841}{130884}Well, Mr. Ryan?
{130949}{131008}Chief, excuse us for a second.
{131009}{131072}Leonard,|come on out of there.
{131202}{131285}The sub we're after|is called the Red October.
{131287}{131352}She's under the command|of a man named Ramius.
{131353}{131384}Now, there's the possibility
{131385}{131453}that he and a good|portion of his crew
{131454}{131492}are attempting to defect.
{131549}{131580}Defect?
{131622}{131652}Excuse me.
{132041}{132112}You say the boat's|called the Red October?
{132113}{132136}That's right.
{132137}{132161}Skipper's Ramius?
{132162}{132191}Right.
{132217}{132252}It seems the circumstances
{132253}{132304}have changed somewhat,|Mr. Ryan.
{132461}{132517}Get this man some dry clothes.
{132518}{132561}I'll be in the conn.
{132562}{132600}Aye, aye, sir.
{132601}{132640}"National Command Authority
{132641}{132704}informed Soviet typhoon class|submarine Red October
{132706}{132741}is potential renegade
{132743}{132788}and threatens|independent missile launch.
{132789}{132860}You are authorized|to use any necessary force
{132861}{132896}to prevent said submarine
{132897}{132920}from approaching
{132921}{132972}the coast|of the United States".
{133313}{133396}Left 10 degrees rudder|steady on course 2-6-5.
{133397}{133494}Left 10 degrees rudder|secure course of 2-6-5.

{133669}{133700}Time Quartermasters|and Navigator
{133701}{133764}on the deck in the conn.
{133839}{133871}What's going on?
{133873}{133932}Battle stations|are manned and ready.
{133933}{133955}Very well.
{133957}{134016}Captain, I have to talk to you.
{134017}{134035}Not now.
{134037}{134084}Make your depth 1,200 feet,
{134085}{134129}20 degrees down angle.
{134130}{134220}Diving officer, make your depth|1,200 feet, 20 degree down.
{134221}{134279}Full dive|on fair water planes.
{134281}{134327}Full dive on stern planes.
{134329}{134379}20 degree down.
{134457}{134532}Passing 450 feet,|going to 1,200.
{134581}{134607}500.
{134662}{134697}600.
{134746}{134777}700.
{134891}{134946}Did you get a good fix?
{134948}{134971}Yes, Captain.
{134973}{134997}Very well.
{134999}{135052}At ordered depth,|1,200 feet.
{135153}{135221}Sonar, Conn.|You got him, yet, Jonesy?
{135222}{135275}Very faint, sir. Hold on.
{135277}{135368}Yes, sir. Contact typhoon seven|on bearing 2-5-0.
{135369}{135416}Right where he's supposed to be.
{135417}{135476}Any sign he's alerted|to our presence?
{135477}{135513}No. Operating as before.
{135514}{135560}Come left 2-6-5.
{135561}{135632}Bring us up|behind him quietly, Tommy.
{135633}{135658}Aye, aye, Captain.
{135660}{135724}Diving officer,|make your depth 500 feet.
{135945}{135987}Captain, please listen to me.
{135989}{136024}Two minutes, that's all.
{136058}{136120}Plot, time to intercept his track.
{136122}{136165}Four minutes, Captain.
{136167}{136217}Very well, Mr. Ryan.
{136219}{136249}Two minutes.
{136409}{136511}It makes perfect sense.|Look at the situation...
{136513}{136575}Ramius intends to defect.|The Russians know this,
{136577}{136612}which is why they've|tried to sink him,
{136614}{136673}but they haven't been able to.
{136675}{136721}I have a firing solution.
{136722}{136780}The Russians|will stop at nothing
{136781}{136828}to prevent Ramius|from defecting.
{136829}{136880}They've invented|this story that he's crazy
{136881}{136940}because they need us|to sink him
{136941}{136987}before he can contact us.
{137037}{137087}Weapons control,|I want full safeties.
{137089}{137152}I don't want this fish|coming back.
{137154}{137180}Full safety.
{137182}{137234}Captain, I know this man.
{137259}{137321}Has he made any Crazy lvans?
{137323}{137357}What difference does that make?
{137359}{137421}- The next one will be to starboard.|- 'Cause his last was to port?
{137423}{137488}Because he goes to starboard|in the bottom half of the hour.
{137610}{137668}Flood tubes one and two.|Warm up the weapons.
{137669}{137758}Find a way to establish contact|without violating orders.
{137760}{137794}He wants to defect!
{137796}{137844}Mr. Thompson,|call Chief Watson
{137845}{137889}to the conn with his sidearm.
{137993}{138056}Conn, Sonar.|Signal to noise ratio's dropping.
{138058}{138108}Possible aspect change|in target.
{138110}{138181}Possible target zig|based on bearing rate.
{138225}{138259}Conn, Sonar. Crazy lvan!
{138358}{138384}Captain.
{138414}{138471}Captain, he's turning.
{138533}{138582}Which way is he turning?
{138584}{138621}To the starboard, sir.
{138649}{138706}Give the man a chance.
{138742}{138788}All back full.
{138789}{138824}Captain, say again.
{138825}{138873}I said all back full!
{138874}{138909}Back full. Aye, sir.
{138910}{138936}Engines back full.
{139053}{139103}We're cavitating.|He can hear us!
{139105}{139161}Conn, aye. All stop.
{139163}{139194}All stop, aye.
{139196}{139267}All right.|We just unzipped our fly.
{139269}{139328}Mr. Thompson,|open the outer doors.
{139329}{139364}Firing point procedures.
{139365}{139435}Now, if that bastard|so much as twitches,
{139437}{139504}I'm going to blow him|right to Mars.
{139505}{139554}All stop rudder amid ship.
{139556}{139590}What's going on?
{139592}{139630}Can you identify the contact?
{139632}{139690}American Los Angeles-class|attack submarine
{139692}{139726}bearing 0-1-5...
{139728}{139762}Captain,|sharp metallic transients.
{139764}{139860}He may be trying to open|his torpedo tube doors.
{139862}{139946}Outer doors are open|on tubes one and two.
{139948}{139982}We're ready to shoot.
{139984}{140053}Very well.|My orders are specific, Mr. Ryan.
{140054}{140102}He's opened his outer doors.
{140104}{140129}He's preparing to fire.
{140131}{140216}Flood tubes three and four|and plot a solution.
{140217}{140303}Captain, flood tubes three and four.|Plot solution.
{140305}{140367}Shall I open|the torpedo tube door, sir?
{140409}{140492}Captain,|shall I open outer doors?
{140493}{140525}No.
{140566}{140628}Lock the firing solution|into the computer.
{140630}{140709}Do not open the doors.
{140885}{140929}Aye, Captain.
{140958}{141006}Lock solution into computer.
{141036}{141091}Conn, Sonar.|Target's flooded his tubes.
{141093}{141152}Has he opened his outer doors?
{141153}{141212}Negative, Captain.|He's just sitting there.
{141213}{141240}Hold on.
{141242}{141316}Hull popping.|Target's coming shallow.
{141318}{141363}What's that mean?
{141390}{141445}That means he's|a very cool customer,
{141447}{141472}your Russian.
{141474}{141545}He knows we're here|and ready to shoot.
{141547}{141581}He's not provoking us.
{141583}{141629}He's heading to periscope depth
{141630}{141689}to see what's on the surface.
{141690}{141761}His course is 2-0-7, due west.
{141762}{141797}Bring us alongside him.
{141799}{141833}Aye, aye, Captain.
{141835}{141889}Sonar, Conn.|Report all contacts.
{141891}{141927}Conn, Sonar.
{141929}{142037}My only contact is typhoon seven,|bearing 1-9-5.
{142039}{142109}Very well. Fire control,|range to target?
{142110}{142148}Range is 300 yards.
{142183}{142229}Make your depth 65 feet.
{142230}{142301}Diving Officer,|make your depth 65 feet.
{142302}{142385}He wants to go up|and take a peek.
{142386}{142428}We'll play along.
{142799}{142834}Going to 45.
{142836}{142881}Going to 45.
{142883}{142915}Weapons status?
{142917}{142957}Weapons are on.
{142959}{143001}Tubes three and four|are flooded.
{143003}{143032}Outer doors are closed.
{143034}{143078}25 meters.
{143080}{143114}Depth 25 meters.
{143116}{143174}Mark this bearing.
{143327}{143415}You wanted to talk|to him, Mr. Ryan.
{143417}{143456}There he is.
{143480}{143527}What do you want to say?
{143529}{143586}Is he the only one looking?
{143588}{143610}Probably.
{143612}{143662}We'll have to chance that.
{143704}{143787}"U.S. told you intend|missile launch". Break.
{143789}{143822}"Do not approach U.S. coast
{143824}{143918}or you will be attacked".|Break.
{143920}{144003}"If intention is other...
{144005}{144039}will you discuss option?"
{144041}{144063}Break.
{144065}{144134}Can he acknowledge|with a single ping?
{144136}{144194}Yeah, he can.
{144196}{144246}The question is, will he?
{144429}{144501}Verify our range to target.
{144503}{144571}One ping only.
{144596}{144633}Aye, captain.
{144792}{144826}I'll be damned.
{144828}{144876}Now what?
{144917}{144954}All right.
{144956}{145022}"If defection..."
{145100}{145191}You plot course toward..."
{145193}{145219}The chart.
{145244}{145278}I need a chart.
{145280}{145335}No. No.
{145337}{145387}OK. Where the hell are we?
{145389}{145478}Someplace deep.|Someplace deep.
{145480}{145528}OK.
{145529}{145554}OK!
{145556}{145601}Send them this!
{145680}{145735}You out of your mind?
{145737}{145800}Just send it.
{145865}{145898}Tell me one thing.
{145900}{145994}How did you know he was|going to go to starboard?
{145996}{146043}I didn't.
{146045}{146140}I had a 50/50 chance.|I needed a break. Sorry.
{146142}{146192}That's all right, Mr. Ryan.
{146193}{146235}My Morse is so rusty
{146237}{146282}I may be sending dimensions
{146284}{146341}on Playmate of the Month.
{146813}{146877}Reverify our range to target.
{146917}{146955}One ping only.
{146957}{146989}Captain, I... I... I just...
{146991}{147049}Give me a ping, Vasily.
{147051}{147127}One ping only, please.
{147193}{147222}Aye, Captain.
{147313}{147373}What the hell is this about?
{147375}{147460}The Russians|want us to sink her.
{147493}{147543}We might have to do that.
{147729}{147803}We must give this American|a wide berth.
{147865}{147907}Let us turn south.
{148153}{148181}Mr. Kamarov.
{148237}{148307}Plot a new course due south.
{148309}{148355}Yes, sir.
{148357}{148405}New course 1-8-0.
{149197}{149232}It's the reactor!
{149233}{149282}Shut down the reactor!
{149341}{149376}Seal the ventilation system!
{149377}{149424}The ventilation controls|have failed!
{149425}{149448}Everybody out.
{149449}{149500}Clear the compartment!
{149530}{149565}Out!
{149797}{149837}Ventilation system,|shut it down now.
{149839}{149876}They don't respond.
{149878}{149912}The controls don't respond!
{149913}{149961}Bypass it.|Seal it manually!
{149962}{150010}Move! Shut it off.
{150034}{150071}Melekhin, say again.
{150245}{150316}Suffered a leak|in the primary coolant tube,
{150317}{150352}so shut down the reactor,
{150353}{150415}but the ventilation circuits|have been disabled.
{150417}{150461}The coolant appears|highly contaminated.
{150463}{150510}I knew there was damage
{150512}{150557}when the caterpillar went down.
{150559}{150617}Radiation alarms activating|in all compartments.
{150619}{150653}Engineering|is heavily contaminated,
{150655}{150687}and radiation's moving forward.
{150689}{150723}Get to periscope depth.
{150725}{150756}Ventilate with outside air.
{150757}{150791}Aye, Captain.|Periscope depth!
{150793}{150827}Prepare to ventilate!
{150829}{150862}Ventilating won't do anything.
{150864}{150909}We've got to get them off.
{150911}{150945}What's the battery condition?
{150946}{151005}Four hours.|Six, if we're cautious.
{151007}{151041}Engage battery system.
{151042}{151107}We've got a level one|radiation leak.
{151109}{151168}Every surface of this|ship's contaminated.
{151169}{151239}We've got to get the men off.
{151241}{151287}Sir, we have been sabotaged!
{151289}{151348}Who said anything|about sabotage?
{151349}{151383}Captain!
{151385}{151459}Sir, I'm afraid|the doctor is right.
{151593}{151627}Very well.
{151629}{151699}Surface. We'll evacuate|the men to the deck.
{151701}{151723}Aye, Captain.
{151725}{151759}Surface the ship!
{151761}{151832}Prepare to muster all personnel|to escape hatches.
{151833}{151868}Break out the rafts.
{151869}{151916}Lash them to the deck.
{151917}{152012}We'll use them as shelters|until the fleet arrives.
{153022}{153081}Make sure the count|is accurate, Doctor.
{153082}{153151}We must get the entire crew out.
{153153}{153186}Yes, sir.
{153188}{153268}Master-At-Arms reports rafts secure|and evacuation proceeding.
{153269}{153295}Very good.
{153459}{153505}We'll rotate through the conn.
{153507}{153601}No officer will spend|more than 20 minutes below deck.
{153603}{153637}Will that be satisfactory?
{153639}{153664}Completely, Captain.
{153666}{153695}Surface contact!
{153697}{153733}2-7-0.
{153735}{153802}6 miles and closing fast.
{153804}{153832}It's a warship.
{153834}{153857}What? Here?
{153859}{153893}Can you identify it?
{153894}{153929}It's a frigate,
{153930}{153969}U.S., probably,
{153971}{154017}Perry class.|He's signaling.
{154038}{154125}"Red October.|Red October.
{154127}{154170}Halt and stay where you are.
{154172}{154215}Do not attempt to submerge,
{154217}{154269}or you will be fired upon".
{154322}{154405}Captain, I think|he means to board us.
{154541}{154599}You will go with the crew.
{154601}{154671}The officers and I will submerge beneath you
{154673}{154709}and scuttle the ship.
{154746}{154820}You'll receive the order of Lenin|for this, Captain.
{155051}{155097}We're going to cast off.
{155099}{155173}The captain's going|to scuttle the ship.
{155303}{155335}He's going down, sir.
{155337}{155380}Put a shot across his bow.
{155381}{155416}Come right at 1-8-0.
{156148}{156205}Seahawk One,|this is Bravo Command.
{156650}{156680}She's ready.
{156732}{156789}Seahawk One,|release on my command.
{156791}{156867}Drop now...now...now.
{157061}{157115}Range to target...|900 yards.
{157154}{157183}800 yards.
{157248}{157280}700 yards.
{157321}{157367}600 yards.
{157484}{157514}500 yards.
{157580}{157620}400 yards.
{157669}{157710}300 yards.
{157777}{157818}The torpedo is detonated.
{157852}{157909}Now, understand, Commander,
{157910}{157968}that torpedo|did not self-destruct.
{157969}{158028}You heard it hit the hull.
{158029}{158106}And I...was never here.
{158108}{158167}Contact Dallas.|Give them the go.
{158169}{158230}Advise Dallas.|Get the DSRV moving.
{158232}{158279}Dallas, this is Rueben James.
{158433}{158476}There are about|two million things
{158477}{158544}that can still go wrong|with this stunt.
{158545}{158603}Central lntelligence Agency.
{158605}{158665}Now, there's|a contradiction in terms.
{158706}{158749}How's the coffee, Ryan?
{158778}{158825}Dallas, this is the Mystic.
{158827}{158861}Request clearance for launch.
{158863}{158925}Mystic, Dallas.|You're cleared for launch.
{158949}{158984}Hatch is secured.
{158985}{159043}Life support, normal.|Prelaunch checks complete.
{159045}{159079}We're ready to launch.
{159081}{159104}Aye.
{159106}{159128}Flood the skirt.
{159129}{159161}Flood the skirt. Aye.
{159163}{159208}Skirt's filled and equalized.
{159209}{159268}Soft seal.|Ready to lift off.
{159269}{159319}OK. Let's do it.
{159361}{159407}We're off.
{159409}{159452}Thrusting port.
{159950}{160009}600 yards and closing.
{160010}{160075}Steer right to course 0-7-5.
{160077}{160099}400.
{160195}{160241}200 yards.
{160299}{160341}100 yards.
{160518}{160556}Hit the lights.
{160873}{160956}Jesus, that's a big sucker.
{161327}{161379}OK, we're in position.
{161381}{161445}You can open the hatch.
{161447}{161484}Hold it a second.
{161485}{161511}Jonesy.
{161561}{161594}Mr. Ryan.
{161673}{161716}He's defecting.
{161739}{161797}And he can't change his mind?
{161798}{161857}He's not going|to change his mind.
{161859}{161936}You willing|to bet your life on that?
{162398}{162459}Uh, sir, could you|hand me that hammer?
{162461}{162487}Yeah.
{163026}{163056}Americans.
{166143}{166180}What's so funny?
{166217}{166277}Well, the captain|seems to think
{166278}{166328}you're some sort of cowboy.
{166669}{166698}It is.
{166753}{166788}I doubt you'd remember,
{166789}{166872}but we met once|at the consulate in Leningrad.
{166873}{166926}Along with your wife.
{166928}{166965}I'm very sorry.
{167026}{167145}What gives you the right|to fire on my ship?
{167146}{167213}Your signal said nothing|of a torpedo.
{167215}{167243}Ryan.
{167277}{167357}It was necessary to maintain|the illusion for your crew.
{167359}{167417}My crew are being rescued, yes?
{167419}{167460}As we speak.
{167556}{167604}You sent the signal.
{167606}{167643}That's correct, sir.
{167685}{167798}Then how did you know|our reactor accident was false?
{167833}{167915}Well, that was a guess,|but it seemed logical.
{168067}{168100}Very well.
{168191}{168252}I present you
{168254}{168327}the ballistic missile|submarine Red October.
{168428}{168516}My officers and I|request asylum...
{168542}{168604}in the United States|of America.
{168649}{168699}It's a pleasure, sir.
{168701}{168752}Bart Mancuso, USS Dallas.
{168824}{168896}Torpedo. The Americans|are shooting at us again.
{168897}{168944}The pitch is too high.
{168945}{168996}The torpedo's Russian.
{168997}{169061}Where the hell|did it come from?
{169063}{169116}Conn, Sonar.|New contact. Sierra 4-1.
{169117}{169157}Alfa class Soviet submarine.
{169243}{169289}Why don't I have a detonation?
{169290}{169369}The weapon enabled|on the far side of the target.
{169371}{169417}It passed Red October|before arming.
{169419}{169501}Fire again with the right settings|and reload both tubes.
{169502}{169570}Get me power.|Get that damn thing off my boat.
{169572}{169595}It's off.
{169624}{169687}I think somebody|shot a torpedo at us.
{169689}{169743}No shit, Buckwheat.|Get out of here.
{169745}{169770}Where am I...
{170113}{170177}Borodin, fire control.
{170202}{170227}Uh, Ryan.
{170229}{170253}Sit here.
{170255}{170329}I'm not a naval officer.|I'm with the CIA.
{170331}{170353}CIA?
{170354}{170389}I'm not an agent.
{170391}{170449}I just write books|for the CIA.
{170451}{170486}Whatever. Sit down.
{170488}{170537}And do exactly what I tell you.
{170539}{170568}DSRVs away.
{170569}{170624}There's a Russian alfa|8,000 yards to starboard.
{170626}{170668}I think it's the Konovalov.
{170670}{170705}Increase the flank.
{170707}{170756}Increase the flank.
{170757}{170779}How?
{170807}{170873}That knob. Turn right full.
{170905}{170957}All ahead flank.|Right full rudder.
{170959}{170994}He's shooting again, sir.
{170996}{171030}Go to battle stations.
{171032}{171053}Battle stations.
{171055}{171125}Chief of Watch,|man battle stations.
{171205}{171252}Torpedo in the water.
{171253}{171282}Bearing 3-1-5.
{171284}{171315}Make range 7,000 yards.
{171317}{171373}Steer right 3-1-5.
{171375}{171424}That's heading|into the torpedo.
{171426}{171473}Steady,|bearing still 3-1-5.
{171475}{171524}Estimated range...|6,000 yards.
{171526}{171563}Still 3-1-5.
{171565}{171629}Steer right|till this reads 3-1-5.
{171631}{171710}No, that's wrong.|Ryan, don't turn that goddamn wheel.
{171742}{171789}3-1-5.
{172044}{172101}You're heading straight|into that torpedo.
{172132}{172165}Yes.
{172166}{172196}Doing what?
{172197}{172242}He's turned|into the torpedo's path.
{172244}{172284}What?
{172286}{172357}Red October's turned directly|into the torpedo's path, sir.
{172359}{172391}Mother of God.
{172393}{172450}Torpedo steady,|bearing 3-1-5.
{172452}{172486}Range...5,000 yards.
{172488}{172522}Melekhin, more speed.
{172629}{172694}Estimate range 3,000 yards.
{172696}{172744}Closing awfully fast.
{172901}{172960}What's he trying to do,|kill himself?
{172962}{173033}We have a firing solution|on the Russian alfa.
{173035}{173069}Can we shoot back?
{173070}{173105}They didn't shoot at us.
{173107}{173165}I can't attack a Soviet submarine|without authorization.
{173229}{173280}Torpedo bearing steady at 3-1-5.
{173282}{173345}Best range... 900 yards.
{173375}{173457}Torpedo impact...|20 seconds.
{173499}{173527}What books?
{173565}{173596}Pardon me.
{173598}{173636}What books did you write?
{173678}{173779}I wrote a biography on Admiral Halsey|called The Fighting Sailor,
{173781}{173821}about naval combat tactics.
{173823}{173859}I know this book.
{173861}{173883}Torpedo impact...
{173885}{173943}Your conclusions|were all wrong, Ryan.
{173945}{173968}10 seconds.
{173969}{174022}Halsey acted stupidly.
{174024}{174054}9...
{174056}{174082}8...
{174084}{174123}7...
{174125}{174150}6...
{174152}{174175}5...
{174177}{174214}4...
{174216}{174245}3...
{174247}{174269}2...
{174270}{174311}Torpedo impact...
{174338}{174372}now.
{174589}{174645}I'll be damned.
{174680}{174716}What happened?
{174718}{174777}Combat tactics, Mr. Ryan.
{174779}{174825}By turning into the torpedo,
{174827}{174873}the captain closed the distance
{174875}{174933}before it could arm itself.
{174934}{174978}So that's it?
{174980}{175007}Not quite.
{175009}{175044}Right now, Captain Tupolev
{175046}{175128}is removing the safety|features on all his weapons.
{175129}{175200}He won't make|the same mistake twice.
{175201}{175268}Vasily, have you|plotted a solution yet?
{175269}{175329}Aye, Captain.|It's a little rough, but I...
{175482}{175508}Gunfire?
{175510}{175560}That's what it sounded like, sir.
{175562}{175600}Won't change his mind?
{175601}{175636}It's one of the crew.
{175637}{175707}Well, whoever he is,|he's having second thoughts.
{176129}{176204}I would like|to have seen Montana.
{176519}{176591}Captain, he stumbled forward|into the missile bay.
{176593}{176641}There's a silo hatch warning...
{176643}{176678}port side, number 20.
{176680}{176716}He can't launch a missile.
{176718}{176796}No, but he can blow one up.
{176834}{176869}Captain, take the conn.
{176870}{176912}Fire control's blasted to hell.
{176914}{176970}Then get behind him|and stay there.
{176972}{176995}Captain, wait.
{177082}{177136}You may need this, sir.
{177218}{177248}Thank you.
{177317}{177388}Don't just stand there, Ryan.|Go with him!
{177389}{177423}You, you speak English?
{177425}{177448}Yes, sir.
{177450}{177492}Get your butt over here.
{177494}{177556}Captain, torpedo|broke off on impact.
{177558}{177612}Set the safety ranges|for zero.
{177613}{177656}I cannot go any faster.
{177658}{177692}We must get him
{177693}{177741}before he gets to|the ignition circuits.
{177937}{178020}What happens if he gets|to that ignition circuitry?
{178021}{178072}He can incinerate the ship.
{178267}{178359}Is that door|the only way out of here?
{178361}{178389}Yes.
{178391}{178448}Don't let him get past you.
{178475}{178516}Hey, Ryan.
{178518}{178599}Be careful|what you shoot at, hmm?
{178601}{178635}Most things in here
{178637}{178699}don't react too well|to bullets.
{178768}{178798}Right.
{179244}{179318}I have to be careful|what I shoot at?
{179513}{179558}Safety ranges set to zero.
{179560}{179631}Sonar, give me the bearing|for Red October.
{179633}{179667}She's positioned behind us.
{179669}{179702}Right full rudder!
{179704}{179754}I'll shake the man loose.
{179903}{179928}He's going deep.
{179930}{179966}30 degree down angle!
{179968}{180034}All the countermeasures|were over there, right?
{180036}{180057}Very well.
{180669}{180716}Admiral,|the alfa's too quick.
{180717}{180767}It's only a matter of time.
{180769}{180832}"Ryan, some things in here
{180834}{180879}don't react well to bullets".
{180881}{180901}Yeah.
{180903}{180934}Like me.
{180936}{180998}I don't react well to bullets.
{181385}{181408}Aah!
{181441}{181468}Where's he now?
{181469}{181491}Close, sir.
{181580}{181629}900 meters, directly ahead.
{181631}{181656}Got him.
{181657}{181693}Match bearings and fire.
{181694}{181729}We are too close!
{181730}{181776}Don't argue.|Launch the weapon.
{181777}{181844}The torpedoes are armed|in the tubes! You cannot...
{181846}{181875}Do it now!
{181909}{181995}Another torpedo. It went active|the moment it was launched.
{181997}{182077}Left full rudder.|Ease off on your bow planes.
{182079}{182113}I think he's got us.
{182347}{182397}Way to go, Dallas!
{182522}{182560}Torpedo is in acquisition.
{182561}{182608}Range 500 yards and closing.
{182609}{182657}You've done it, Mr. Thompson!
{182658}{182692}I hope this works.
{182693}{182752}Chief, put us on the roof.
{182753}{182840}Countermeasure station,|on my mark. 5, 4...
{182908}{182952}1. Release countermeasures.
{182954}{182984}Emergency blow!
{182985}{183029}Full rise. Fair water plane.
{183165}{183196}600 feet.
{183197}{183238}550...
{183240}{183288}500 feet.
{183290}{183312}450...
{183313}{183369}Come on, big D. Fly.
{183828}{183862}That torpedo's still active.
{183864}{183913}It's searching|for another target.
{184518}{184568}A goddamn cook!
{185256}{185315}How close is that alfa, Jonesy?
{185317}{185353}1,000 yards, going to port.
{185355}{185404}Reverse your turn.
{185530}{185589}We're turning straight at him.
{185590}{185633}Torpedo's still on our tail.
{185727}{185788}The hard part|about playing chicken
{185789}{185841}is knowing when to flinch.
{185972}{186007}Collision in 400 yards.
{186009}{186037}350...
{186039}{186065}300...
{186067}{186107}Captain!
{186109}{186179}Right full rudder,|30 degree down angle.
{186181}{186212}Aye, sir.
{186213}{186261}This one's going to be close.
{186365}{186399}Torpedo dead ahead!
{186401}{186456}You arrogant ass.|You've killed us.
{187129}{187188}We have ascertained|the Red October's
{187190}{187240}final position, but...
{187242}{187292}given the depth of the water
{187293}{187340}and the fact that the wreckage
{187341}{187389}spreads across a wide area,
{187391}{187460}it'll be some time before|anything's recovered.
{187461}{187532}However, your people|are interviewing the crew now
{187533}{187593}and making arrangements|for their return.
{187595}{187665}This has been a terrible tragedy,|Mr. Ambassador.
{187666}{187713}And I can only stress
{187714}{187785}that if you'd come to us earlier
{187786}{187833}it might have been avoided.
{187834}{187905}I appreciate your candor|in the matter.
{187906}{187966}And I yours, Andrei.
{188051}{188085}Perhaps in the future
{188086}{188160}technology will allow|a more thorough investigation
{188161}{188192}of the wreckage.
{188193}{188241}Perhaps.
{188384}{188435}There is another matter...
{188437}{188487}one that I'm reluctant to...
{188489}{188541}Please.
{188566}{188625}One of our submarines...|an alfa...
{188627}{188728}was last reported in the area|of the Grand Banks.
{188730}{188815}We have not heard|from her for some time.
{188877}{188912}Andrei.
{188937}{188994}You've lost another submarine?
{189341}{189445}All this way to hide|a submarine in a river.
{189447}{189524}We're 100 miles|from the nearest naval base,
{189526}{189600}the last place|that satellites will ever look.
{189651}{189700}I grew up around here.
{189746}{189806}My grandfather taught me to fish
{189808}{189868}off that island right over there.
{189949}{189984}There's one question
{189985}{190036}you haven't asked me yet.
{190077}{190127}Why?
{190165}{190247}Well, I figured you would tell me|when you were ready.
{190290}{190349}Now, there are|those who believe
{190351}{190421}we should attack|the United States first,
{190422}{190488}settle everything|in one moment.
{190489}{190561}Red October was built|for that purpose.
{190562}{190621}When the dust settles|from this,
{190622}{190693}there's going to be|hell to pay in Moscow.
{190695}{190721}Well, perhaps.
{190723}{190793}Maybe something good|will come from it.
{190794}{190853}A little revolution,|now and then,
{190854}{190928}is a healthy thing,|don't you think?
{191075}{191133}Do you still like to fish, Ryan?
{191134}{191173}Mm-hmm.
{191199}{191269}There's a river,|not unlike this one,
{191270}{191293}near Vilnius,
{191295}{191368}where my grandfather|taught me to fish.
{191440}{191553}"And the sea will grant|each man new hope
{191555}{191680}as sleep brings dreams of home".
{191794}{191840}Christopher Columbus.
{191950}{192012}Welcome to the New World, sir.
{192244}{192284}Everything all right, sir?
