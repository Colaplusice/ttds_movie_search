1
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:55,471
This is Media-Break.

2
00:00:55,506 --> 00:00:59,475
You give us three minutes
and we'll give you the world.

3
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,436
Good morning, I'm Casey Wong
with Jess Perkins.

4
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:04,480
Top story, Pretoria.

5
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:08,442
The threat of nuclear confrontation
in South Africa escalated today...

6
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:11,404
...when the military government
of that besieged city-state...

7
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,282
...unveiled a French-made
neutron bomb...

8
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:18,494
...and affirmed that it would use
it as the city's last line of defense.

9
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,542
The president's first press conference
from the Star Wars Peace Platform...

10
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,546
...got off to a shaky start
when power failed...

11
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:32,425
...causing a period of weightlessness
for the president and his staff.

12
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,512
We'll be back in a moment.

13
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:39,432
Is it time for that operation?

14
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:42,435
This may be the most important
decision of your life.

15
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,397
So come down and talk to one of our
qualified surgeons...

16
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:48,399
...at the Family Heart Center.

17
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:53,404
We feature the complete line
of hearts by Jensen and Yamaha.

18
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,448
You pick the heart.

19
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:58,367
Extended warranties. Financing.

20
00:01:58,402 --> 00:02:00,369
Qualifies for health tax credit.

21
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:06,667
And remember, we care.

22
00:02:06,702 --> 00:02:09,629
Three dead police officers,
one critically injured.

23
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:13,633
Police leaders blame
Omni Consumer Products, OCP...

24
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:17,553
...the firm which recently agreed
with the city to fund and run...

25
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:20,556
...the Detroit Metro
Police Department.

26
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:22,600
Dick Jones, president of OCP.

27
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:26,521
Every policeman knows
there are inherent risks in his job.

28
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:31,442
If you can't stand the heat,
you better stay out of the kitchen.

29
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:35,488
Although wounded, Officer Frederickson
escaped and identified this man.

30
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:40,451
Clarence Boddicker, unofficial
crime boss of Old Detroit...

31
00:02:40,486 --> 00:02:44,330
...sought in connection with
the deaths of 31 officers.

32
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:48,417
Today he is free while doctors
at Henry Ford Hospital...

33
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:51,462
...fight to save
Officer Frank Frederickson.

34
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:55,633
Good luck, Frank.

35
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:05,643
Attempted murder?
It's not like he killed someone.

36
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:08,604
This violates
my client's civil rights.

37
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,524
Make it assault and I can make
bail in cash, now.

38
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:15,486
Listen, your client's a scumbag,
you're a scumbag...

39
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,489
...and scumbags see the judge.

40
00:03:18,524 --> 00:03:22,451
Now get out of my police station
and take Laughing Boy with you.

41
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,461
Hi.

42
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:35,506
Murphy, transferring in
from Metro South.

43
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,425
Nice precinct.

44
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,385
Yeah, pretty good.

45
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,721
You work for a living down here.

46
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:45,641
Get your armor and suit up.

47
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,649
- No, you can't get a cup of coffee.
- Oh, sarge.

48
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:57,570
- Stark, any word on Frederickson?
- Still listed as critical.

49
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:59,530
His wife must be going crazy.

50
00:03:59,565 --> 00:04:00,531
- Murphy?
- Yeah, that's me.

51
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:01,532
- Manson.
- Hi.

52
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,492
What brings you to paradise?

53
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:06,495
I think the OCP's moving
a lot of new guys here.

54
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,458
Omni Consumer Products.
What a bunch of morons.

55
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,588
They're gonna manage this department
right into the ground.

56
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,548
- Where you from?
- Metro South.

57
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,591
Welcome to hell.

58
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:20,551
- Murphy?
- Yo.

59
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:24,514
- Cut 10 guys loose on the east side.
- Try to get up when you're in a jam.

60
00:04:24,549 --> 00:04:27,517
Try to get a Medevac
after you been jammed.

61
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:31,604
I'll tell you what we should do.
We should strike.

62
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,620
The funeral is tomorrow.

63
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:51,624
Department requests all officers
not on duty to attend.

64
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:55,586
Any donations for the family
may be given to Cecil as usual.

65
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,510
I don't want to hear any more
talk about strike.

66
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:06,472
We're not plumbers,
we're police officers.

67
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:10,518
And police officers don't strike.

68
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:16,482
Murphy. Front and center.

69
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,627
Ooh, tiger!

70
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,563
Lewis, come here when you're finished
fucking around with your suspect.

71
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:03,529
This guy's gonna be your new partner.

72
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,699
Murphy, meet Lewis.
Show him the neighborhood.

73
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,701
Glad to know you, Murphy.

74
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:12,622
Pretty neat.

75
00:06:12,657 --> 00:06:16,667
I better drive
until you know your way around.

76
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:20,630
I usually drive
when I'm breaking in a new partner.

77
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,611
You really think
the old man will be there?

78
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:45,571
Why invite us?

79
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:49,450
All the division heads are bringing
their support teams. It's big.

80
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:51,702
They're green lighting Delta City.

81
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:54,705
No way. They never
move ahead of schedule.

82
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,709
Jones has the 209 series ready
and wants to show off.

83
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:01,671
- Tough break, Bob.
- What?

84
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:05,675
When ED 209 ran into serious delays...

85
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,677
...the old man ordered a backup plan.

86
00:07:07,712 --> 00:07:09,762
95th floor, have a nice day.

87
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:12,723
Probably to light a fire
under Jones' ass.

88
00:07:12,758 --> 00:07:16,644
- Yeah.
- Old Bob here gets the assignment.

89
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:19,647
Nobody in Security Concepts
takes it seriously.

90
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:22,608
Fucking Jones, I'd go
straight to the old man if I could.

91
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,652
Don't mess with Jones.

92
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:27,613
Be careful, man.
I hear Jones is a real shark.

93
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,615
- Who asked you, twerp?
- Bob.

94
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,617
What's the problem with the police?

95
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:35,496
Their union's been bitching ever since
we took over. The usual stuff.

96
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,583
But we'll turn things around.

97
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:42,753
Good. Very good.
Let's get started.

98
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,720
My friends.

99
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:54,682
I've had this dream
for more than a decade now.

100
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,645
A dream which I've invited
you all to share with me.

101
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,650
In six months
we begin construction...

102
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,653
...of Delta City.

103
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:11,574
Where Old Detroit now stands.

104
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,579
Old Detroit has a cancer.

105
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:18,539
The cancer is crime.

106
00:08:18,574 --> 00:08:20,541
It must be cut out before we
employ the 2 million...

107
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:23,586
...workers to breathe life
back into the city.

108
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:27,798
Yes.

109
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:32,803
Shifts in tax structure have made the
economy ideal for corporate growth.

110
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,725
But community services,
in this case law enforcement...

111
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,770
...have suffered.

112
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:44,690
I think it's time
we gave something back.

113
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,583
Take a close look
at the track record of this company.

114
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:05,628
You'll see that we've gambled...

115
00:09:05,663 --> 00:09:08,589
...in markets usually regarded
as nonprofit.

116
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:12,552
Hospitals. Prisons.
Space exploration.

117
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:17,849
I say, good business
is where you find it.

118
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,770
As you know, we now have a contract
to run local law enforcement.

119
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,816
But at Security Concepts...

120
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:30,695
...we believe an efficient police
force is only part of the solution.

121
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,740
No, we need something more.

122
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,702
We need a 24-hour-a-day
police officer.

123
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:40,705
A cop who doesn't need
to eat or sleep.

124
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,667
A cop with superior firepower
and the reflexes to use it.

125
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,629
Fellow executives...

126
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:52,633
...it's a pleasure to introduce you
to the future of law enforcement.

127
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,642
ED 209.

128
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,678
The Enforcement Droid series 209...

129
00:10:37,713 --> 00:10:40,681
...is a self-sufficient
law enforcement robot.

130
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:44,644
209 is programmed for urban
pacification, but that's just a start.

131
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,605
After a successful
tour in Old Detroit...

132
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,734
...we can expect 209 to become the hot
military product for the next decade.

133
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,822
- Dr. McNamara.
- We'll need a subject.

134
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:57,823
- Mr. Kinney.
- Yes, sir.

135
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,742
- Will you give us a hand?
- Yes, sir.

136
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:03,746
Mr. Kinney will help us simulate a
typical arrest and disarming procedure.

137
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,752
Mr. Kinney, use your gun
in a threatening manner.

138
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,799
- Point it at ED 209.
- Yes, sir.

139
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,724
Please put down your weapon.

140
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,645
You have 20 seconds to comply.

141
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,649
I think you better
do what he says.

142
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,824
You now have 15 seconds to comply.

143
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:43,953
You are in direct violation
of penal code 113, section 9.

144
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,832
- You have five seconds to comply.
- Help me!

145
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:51,836
- Four, three, two, one.
- Help me! Help!

146
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:55,756
I am now authorized
to use physical force.

147
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,701
Somebody want to call a paramedic?

148
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:27,830
- Let's go, Johnson.
- You pull the plug on this thing?

149
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:30,917
All right, don't touch him.

150
00:12:30,952 --> 00:12:33,920
- Don't touch him!
- He didn't hear the gun drop.

151
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:36,881
He didn't hear it?!

152
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:40,760
Dick, I'm very disappointed.

153
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,805
It's only a glitch.
A temporary setback.

154
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,808
You call this a glitch?

155
00:12:47,843 --> 00:12:50,853
We're to begin
construction in six months.

156
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:54,815
This setback could cost us
millions in interest costs alone.

157
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,859
Not necessarily, sir.

158
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:58,819
There's a Robocop program...

159
00:12:58,854 --> 00:13:01,781
...I developed as a contingency
against just this sort of thing.

160
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:03,741
Thank you for your concern.

161
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:07,703
- This is something we could...
- Wait a minute. Dick!

162
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:13,709
Maybe what we need here
is a fresh perspective.

163
00:13:13,744 --> 00:13:16,879
Tell me about your plan.
How long will it take?

164
00:13:16,914 --> 00:13:20,925
We've restructured the police
department with some good candidates.

165
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,928
We can go to prototype
within 90 days.

166
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:24,929
Very good.

167
00:13:24,964 --> 00:13:28,933
Get your staff together. I'll expect
a presentation in 20 minutes.

168
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,855
Thank you, sir.

169
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:41,863
That's how it is in the big leagues.
You see an opening, you go for it.

170
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,909
Watch your back,
Jones will be looking for you.

171
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:50,788
Fuck Jones. He fumbled the ball
and I was there to pick it up.

172
00:13:50,823 --> 00:13:53,708
Too bad about Kinney, huh?

173
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:56,669
That's life in the big city.

174
00:13:56,704 --> 00:13:58,713
When do we start?

175
00:13:58,748 --> 00:14:02,884
As soon as some schmuck volunteers.

176
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,860
Pretty fancy moves, Murphy.

177
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:23,863
My son watches this cop show,
TJ Lazer.

178
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:26,866
Lazer does this whenever
he kills a bad guy.

179
00:14:26,901 --> 00:14:30,828
- My kid thinks every good cop...
- You don't want to disappoint him.

180
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:35,833
Yeah, well, role models can be
very important to a boy.

181
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,717
Okay, I get a kick out of it.

182
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:46,761
All units, sector nine...

183
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:49,722
Well, that's...

184
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:54,018
Why don't you drive?

185
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,982
Shit!

186
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:02,860
- I don't believe it!
- What?

187
00:15:02,895 --> 00:15:04,862
You burnt the fucking money!

188
00:15:04,897 --> 00:15:06,906
I had to blow the door!

189
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:08,908
It's as good as marked, asshole.

190
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:11,953
You stupid, stupid asshole!

191
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:14,872
- Clarence!
- What do you want?!

192
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:18,793
We got a cop on our tail.

193
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,800
- Come on, speed it up.
- Move it!

194
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:28,761
- We ain't gonna outrun a cop.
- Slow down.

195
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:31,764
- Are you crazy?
- Shut the fuck up and do it!

196
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,723
Just do it!

197
00:15:32,758 --> 00:15:36,811
This is 154. We're in pursuit
of suspect. Request backup.

198
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:42,024
- Roger, 154. Backup unavailable.
- Give me your piece.

199
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,111
Backup ETA, 15 minutes.

200
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:47,071
Bobby, get the door!

201
00:15:47,106 --> 00:15:49,991
- Everybody load up!
- Let's go, come on.

202
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:53,911
- Okay.
- All right, here we go.

203
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,880
- What the fuck?
- Where'd he go?

204
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:04,839
Emil!

205
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:08,843
He's up here!

206
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,943
Get him!

207
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,075
Shit, Clarence, my leg.

208
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,036
Leon, pick him up.

209
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,914
- Ready?
- Nope, hang on.

210
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:40,917
Bobby.

211
00:16:40,952 --> 00:16:42,960
- Can you fly, Bobby?
- Clarence, no!

212
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:46,923
Hit it!

213
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:13,991
This is 154. We've located that van
in sector 3D. Where's backup?

214
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:19,038
Backup unavailable. Estimate 20
minutes before units can arrive.

215
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,002
Well, you call it.

216
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:28,923
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

217
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,888
Go.

218
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:39,934
Stay in touch.

219
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,935
Freeze.

220
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,897
Okay, let's see those hands.

221
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:27,857
Nice and easy.

222
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:29,984
Sure.

223
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:33,988
Mind if I zip this up?

224
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,051
We rob banks, but never
get to keep the money.

225
00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:59,013
We steal money to buy coke,
then sell the coke to make more money.

226
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:04,060
- Capital investment, man.
- Why bother? We could just steal it.

227
00:19:04,095 --> 00:19:07,021
No better way to steal
than free enterprise.

228
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:08,064
Smoke?

229
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:12,026
No, those things will kill you.

230
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:16,072
You want to live forever?

231
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:30,962
Don't move.

232
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,883
Go ahead and do it.

233
00:19:35,918 --> 00:19:40,012
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

234
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,102
Lewis?

235
00:19:46,137 --> 00:19:49,105
Lewis!

236
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,065
I got a situation in here.

237
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,068
Okay, tough guy, get up. Get up!

238
00:19:54,103 --> 00:19:57,029
Turn around and spread your legs.
That's right.

239
00:19:57,064 --> 00:20:01,075
Lewis, where are you?
You all right?

240
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,035
Hands on your head.

241
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,914
Lewis.

242
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,920
Let us take over from here, Emil.

243
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,147
Your ass is mine.

244
00:20:31,182 --> 00:20:34,150
No!

245
00:20:34,185 --> 00:20:38,070
Not yet, it ain't.

246
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:52,001
Well, what have we here?

247
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:56,047
You a good cop, hotshot?

248
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,966
Sure you are.

249
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:02,970
You gotta be some kind of great cop.

250
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:06,974
Come in here all by yourself.

251
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:10,895
Where's your partner?

252
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,064
Where's your partner?

253
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:16,150
Guys, the other one was upstairs.

254
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:20,112
She was sweet.

255
00:21:20,147 --> 00:21:24,116
I took her out.

256
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:30,122
I bet that really pisses you off.

257
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:37,046
You probably don't think
I'm a very nice guy.

258
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:39,006
Do you?

259
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:43,010
I think you're slime.

260
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,974
See, I got this problem.

261
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:50,059
Cops don't like me.

262
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:53,980
So I don't like cops.

263
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,166
Well, give the man a hand.

264
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:19,130
He's all yours.

265
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,058
- Look out.
- Turn around, man.

266
00:22:31,093 --> 00:22:35,062
Hey, pretty boy. Hey, over here.

267
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,126
I'm out of ammo.

268
00:22:57,161 --> 00:23:01,214
Me too.

269
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:07,136
Hey, Clarence! He is still alive

270
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:11,140
Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

271
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:20,149
Okay, fun's over.

272
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:28,032
Okay, let's get out of here.

273
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:31,994
Good night, sweet prince.

274
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:36,123
Hey, wait up. Wait up.

275
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:01,148
Murphy.

276
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:21,043
- Get him over.
- Clear.

277
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:25,131
Ventilate him. Get the mask.

278
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:42,190
Okay, hit the door.

279
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,154
- Let me get pressure.
- Mask him.

280
00:24:48,189 --> 00:24:50,198
Got a pressure of 60 pel.

281
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:54,076
We're gonna have to
intubate this guy.

282
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,041
All right, I got it in.
Breath sounds?

283
00:25:00,076 --> 00:25:03,085
- You're in.
- Other side.

284
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,047
- Let's get the mask trousers up.
- Get the clothes off.

285
00:25:06,082 --> 00:25:09,175
Clothes off. Prep him
for a central line.

286
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:13,095
Let's get some blood drawn.
Type and crossing, six units.

287
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,227
Pressure's dropping.

288
00:25:19,262 --> 00:25:23,272
Central line's in, getting
pressure back. Normal saline.

289
00:25:23,307 --> 00:25:27,193
Can you do that, Dad?

290
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:31,197
- I really have to tell you something.
- Blood pressure?

291
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:35,201
- I've got 40 pel.
- All right.

292
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:44,210
Coarse D-fib.
Okay, we gotta shock him.

293
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:50,174
Put the Foley in.
Let's blow the mask trousers.

294
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:54,053
- Okay.
- Stand clear.

295
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:58,099
Coarse D-fib.
Let's shock him again.

296
00:25:58,134 --> 00:26:02,353
Clear.

297
00:26:02,388 --> 00:26:06,274
Flat line. Let's go,
intracardiac epinephrine.

298
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:12,280
- All right, it's in.
- No pulse.

299
00:26:12,315 --> 00:26:16,242
Let's go ahead and shock
a flat line and then quit.

300
00:26:16,277 --> 00:26:20,288
- Okay, everybody stand clear.
- Clear.

301
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:28,171
All right, that's all we can do.
Let's call it.

302
00:26:28,206 --> 00:26:30,131
What's the time?

303
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:34,177
6:15.

304
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:50,193
Sharp.

305
00:26:50,228 --> 00:26:54,280
It's starting to roll.

306
00:26:54,315 --> 00:26:58,284
Shit!

307
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,164
Bring in the L.E.D.

308
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:07,293
Lock it down.

309
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:14,258
- He's on.
- What's the story?

310
00:27:14,293 --> 00:27:16,135
- We saved the left arm.
- What?

311
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:20,139
We agreed on total body prosthesis.
Now lose the arm.

312
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:23,142
Jesus, Morton.

313
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:27,146
- Can he understand?
- We'll blank his memory, anyway.

314
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:30,066
We should lose the arm.
What do you think?

315
00:27:30,101 --> 00:27:33,152
He signed a release when he joined
the force. And he's dead.

316
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:37,281
We can do pretty much what we want.

317
00:27:37,316 --> 00:27:39,325
Lose the arm.

318
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,329
Shut him down. Prep him for surgery.

319
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:49,377
The outer skin will be like this.

320
00:27:49,412 --> 00:27:51,379
It's titanium, laminated with Kevlar.

321
00:27:51,414 --> 00:27:55,258
Go ahead, shake his hand.

322
00:27:55,293 --> 00:27:59,303
Come here often? How you doing?

323
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:03,182
Got a hell of a grip.

324
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:05,142
It's 400 foot-pounds.

325
00:28:05,177 --> 00:28:07,186
He could crush
every bone in your hand.

326
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:10,189
All right, attach it to his shoulder.

327
00:28:10,224 --> 00:28:14,151
I like that.

328
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:21,200
You're gonna be a bad motherfucker!

329
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,334
Hey, hey. Look, he's watching us!

330
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:40,344
This is for you.

331
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:45,224
Happy New Year.

332
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:50,229
We get the best of both worlds.

333
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:52,190
The fastest reflexes possible today...

334
00:28:52,225 --> 00:28:54,233
...computer-assisted memory...

335
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:58,196
...and a lifetime of on-the-street
officer programming.

336
00:28:58,231 --> 00:29:02,241
It is my great pleasure
to present to you...

337
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:07,205
...Robocop.

338
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,333
Come on, come on.

339
00:29:10,368 --> 00:29:12,335
That's for you.

340
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,380
- That's for you.
- Go, Robo.

341
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:34,357
I'm what you call a repeat offender.

342
00:29:34,392 --> 00:29:37,318
I will offend again.

343
00:29:37,353 --> 00:29:39,278
I get my orders from a higher source.

344
00:29:39,313 --> 00:29:43,241
Shut up, asshole.

345
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:49,288
- Go through the side.
- A cell is set for observation.

346
00:29:49,323 --> 00:29:51,249
What's this all about?

347
00:29:51,284 --> 00:29:53,251
- Who's this?
- Sergeant John Reed.

348
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:57,338
It's official OCP business,
so please, get lost.

349
00:29:57,373 --> 00:30:01,342
- We got four or five days...
- Hey, this is bullshit!

350
00:30:01,377 --> 00:30:05,388
I take my orders from...

351
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:23,322
What is this shit?

352
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:45,386
When at rest, you'll sit in a chair.

353
00:30:45,421 --> 00:30:47,346
Yes, I understand.

354
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:48,347
What about tracking?

355
00:30:48,382 --> 00:30:52,393
We check his exact location
with one of these.

356
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:54,353
How does he eat?

357
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:57,356
His digestive system is simple.

358
00:30:57,391 --> 00:31:01,360
This processor dispenses a paste
that sustains his organic systems.

359
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:13,331
It tastes like baby food.

360
00:31:13,366 --> 00:31:17,376
Knock yourself out.

361
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:27,303
- Let's start with tracking.
- Give me a grid.

362
00:31:27,338 --> 00:31:29,222
- Got it?
- Clear.

363
00:31:29,257 --> 00:31:32,308
- Target.
- Check.

364
00:31:32,343 --> 00:31:36,354
Now follow.

365
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,439
Check.

366
00:31:38,474 --> 00:31:40,399
Voice stress analyzer.

367
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:43,402
- It's up.
- One, two...

368
00:31:43,437 --> 00:31:44,445
...three.

369
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,447
- Check.
- Record.

370
00:31:46,482 --> 00:31:49,408
- Now playback.
- Bring it up 50%.

371
00:31:49,443 --> 00:31:51,410
Full frame.

372
00:31:51,445 --> 00:31:52,453
I think he's ready.

373
00:31:52,488 --> 00:31:56,415
- We got it.
- All right, clear out.

374
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,417
What are your prime directives?

375
00:31:58,452 --> 00:32:00,378
Serve the public trust.

376
00:32:00,413 --> 00:32:02,338
Protect the innocent. Uphold the law.

377
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,302
That's good.

378
00:32:08,337 --> 00:32:12,306
That's very good.

379
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:22,483
I fucking love that guy.

380
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:01,355
- It's Supercop.
- Look at that fucking gun.

381
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:19,499
Shit!

382
00:33:19,534 --> 00:33:22,502
- This guy is good.
- He's not a guy, he's a machine.

383
00:33:22,537 --> 00:33:26,506
What are they gonna do?
Replace us?

384
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:35,431
Come on.

385
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:39,352
- Reed.
- Yeah.

386
00:33:39,387 --> 00:33:42,396
He needs a car.

387
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:45,358
Thank you.

388
00:33:45,393 --> 00:33:46,359
Sure.

389
00:33:46,394 --> 00:33:47,318
Anytime.

390
00:33:47,353 --> 00:33:51,322
Oh, yeah. Go get 'em, boy.

391
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,442
I'd buy that for a dollar.

392
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:35,366
And guess what I'm going to do now?

393
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,371
Happy birthday, Bixby.

394
00:34:40,406 --> 00:34:42,498
Is there anything else, sir?

395
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:44,500
Empty the register
and put the money in the bag.

396
00:34:44,535 --> 00:34:46,544
Excuse me?

397
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:50,590
I said, give me your money, all of it,
and don't fuck with me!

398
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:52,550
Now move!

399
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:54,510
Open the safe, pops.

400
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:56,554
Open the goddamn safe!

401
00:34:56,589 --> 00:34:58,472
- We don't have a safe.
- Shit.

402
00:34:58,507 --> 00:35:02,435
There's your goddamned safe!
Now open the son of a bitch.

403
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,521
Quit stalling.
You better open that son of a bitch!

404
00:35:05,556 --> 00:35:07,523
Come on!

405
00:35:07,558 --> 00:35:10,484
I'm gonna blow her brains out.

406
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:14,489
- I'll open the safe.
- Good boy.

407
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:19,452
You better open that on the count
of three. One, two...

408
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:24,457
Fuck me.

409
00:35:24,492 --> 00:35:27,376
Drop the gun. You are under arrest.

410
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:31,422
Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!

411
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:53,569
Thank you for your cooperation.
Good night.

412
00:35:53,604 --> 00:35:57,490
I'll buy that for a dollar!

413
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:13,464
No, please!

414
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:14,507
Don't touch me!

415
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:18,594
- Get away! Get away!
- We don't want your money!

416
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:24,600
Take it easy.
We don't want to hurt you.

417
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:25,685
Too much hair.

418
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,605
I know! We'll give her a haircut.

419
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:32,567
- Hey, hey!
- What?

420
00:36:32,602 --> 00:36:36,529
There's more hair down there!

421
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:43,536
No! Don't!

422
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:47,498
Please.

423
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:54,463
Let the woman go.
You are under arrest.

424
00:36:54,498 --> 00:36:56,465
Shit.

425
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,468
You better back up, pal,
because he's gonna do her!

426
00:36:59,503 --> 00:37:03,431
He's gonna kill her!

427
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:10,605
He's gonna kill her!

428
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:18,613
Your move, creep.

429
00:37:18,648 --> 00:37:22,617
No problem. It's okay.

430
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:26,579
Thank God.

431
00:37:26,614 --> 00:37:30,500
I was so scared. Thank you.

432
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:32,543
Thank you.

433
00:37:32,578 --> 00:37:35,546
Madam, you have suffered
an emotional shock.

434
00:37:35,581 --> 00:37:39,592
I will notify a rape crisis center.

435
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:53,481
All units, sector six.
Please close intersections...

436
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:03,658
I don't care.
Get those men by the stairs, now.

437
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:09,622
Terrorism has never been a factor
in city politics before.

438
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:11,624
That changed today
when former councilman...

439
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:13,584
...Ron Miller entered
City Hall with a gun.

440
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:15,670
He's on the second floor...

441
00:38:15,705 --> 00:38:17,630
...holding Mayor Gibson
and his staff hostage.

442
00:38:17,665 --> 00:38:21,551
We do believe that Miller
has killed one of the hostages.

443
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:26,556
- Lieutenant, what's next?
- We wait. Terrorism is very tricky.

444
00:38:26,591 --> 00:38:30,560
Massive and immediate retaliation
is the best policy. Unfortunately...

445
00:38:30,595 --> 00:38:34,522
- Excuse us.
- Wait, where you going?

446
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:39,485
Statement, please.

447
00:38:41,571 --> 00:38:45,575
Hey, let's have some crowd control.
Come on, get these people back!

448
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,661
- Where the hell are you going?
- Keep him talking.

449
00:38:48,696 --> 00:38:52,707
One quick question here!

450
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:54,584
Who made you?

451
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:58,629
Are you invincible?

452
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:02,675
Okay, Miller. Don't hurt the mayor.

453
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,635
We'll give you whatever you want.

454
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,638
First, don't fuck with me.

455
00:39:07,673 --> 00:39:09,682
I'm a desperate man.

456
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:13,644
And second, I want some fresh coffee.

457
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,646
And third, I want a recount.

458
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:18,649
No matter how it turns out,
I want my old job back.

459
00:39:18,684 --> 00:39:22,570
- Okay.
- And I want a bigger office.

460
00:39:22,605 --> 00:39:26,532
And I want a new car!
And I want the city to pay for it all!

461
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:30,578
- What kind of car, Miller?
- One with reclining leather seats...

462
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:33,623
...that goes really fast
and gets really shitty gas mileage.

463
00:39:33,658 --> 00:39:37,710
How about the 6000 SUX?

464
00:39:37,745 --> 00:39:38,753
Yeah.

465
00:39:38,788 --> 00:39:41,672
Okay, sure.

466
00:39:41,707 --> 00:39:44,675
What about cruise control?
Does it have cruise control?

467
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,594
No problem, Miller.

468
00:39:46,629 --> 00:39:50,640
Let the mayor go,
we'll even throw in a Blaupunkt.

469
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:53,601
Lieutenant, don't jerk me off!

470
00:39:53,636 --> 00:39:56,687
When people jerk me off, I kill them!

471
00:39:56,722 --> 00:40:00,650
You want to see?

472
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:04,654
Get up, Your Honor. Get up!

473
00:40:04,689 --> 00:40:08,533
Get up. Your public wants to see you.

474
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:12,537
Nobody ever takes me seriously!

475
00:40:12,572 --> 00:40:13,496
We'll get serious now...

476
00:40:13,531 --> 00:40:17,542
...and kiss the mayor's ass goodbye!

477
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,805
Robocop. Who is he? What is he?

478
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,723
Where does he come from?

479
00:40:32,758 --> 00:40:34,642
He is OCP's newest soldier...

480
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:37,687
...in their revolutionary
crime management program.

481
00:40:37,722 --> 00:40:39,689
OCP spokesmen claim
the fearless machine...

482
00:40:39,724 --> 00:40:41,649
...has crooks on the run
in Old Detroit.

483
00:40:41,684 --> 00:40:45,611
Today, kids at Lee Iacocca Elementary
got to meet in person...

484
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:48,614
...what their parents only
read about in comic books.

485
00:40:48,649 --> 00:40:50,658
Excuse me, Robo...

486
00:40:50,693 --> 00:40:54,662
...any special message for all
the kids watching at home?

487
00:40:54,697 --> 00:40:57,623
Stay out of trouble.

488
00:40:57,658 --> 00:41:00,626
More fighting in the Mexican crisis...

489
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:03,629
...when American troops joined
in a raid with Mexican Nationals...

490
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:07,592
...against rebel rocket
positions in Acapulco.

491
00:41:07,627 --> 00:41:08,759
Now this.

492
00:41:08,794 --> 00:41:12,763
Red alert. Red alert.

493
00:41:12,798 --> 00:41:14,807
You crossed my line of death.

494
00:41:14,842 --> 00:41:16,684
You haven't dismantled
your MX stockpile.

495
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:19,729
Pakistan is threatening my border!

496
00:41:19,764 --> 00:41:23,691
That's it, buster.
No more military aid.

497
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:26,736
Nuke 'em.

498
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:27,737
Get them before they get you.

499
00:41:27,772 --> 00:41:31,616
Another quality home game
from Butler Brothers.

500
00:41:31,651 --> 00:41:35,661
Today labor leaders agreed to sanction
construction of OCP's Delta City...

501
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:39,624
...thereby creating one million
much-needed new jobs...

502
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:43,586
...despite questions about worker
safety in dangerous Old Detroit.

503
00:41:43,621 --> 00:41:47,632
Robert Morton, vice president,
Security Concepts, OCP.

504
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:51,636
I can't comment on Delta City.
But I will tell you this:

505
00:41:51,671 --> 00:41:55,598
Security Concepts projects the end of
crime in Old Detroit within 40 days.

506
00:41:56,766 --> 00:42:00,853
There's a new guy in town.
His name's Robocop.

507
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:06,901
Hey, hey, hey, Bobby-boy.
Vice president. Congratulations.

508
00:42:06,936 --> 00:42:09,779
- Handball Tuesday night?
- I would, Bill...

509
00:42:09,814 --> 00:42:12,698
...but I've got some models
coming to my place.

510
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:16,661
I'd buy that for a dollar.

511
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:22,667
Welcome to the club, Bob.

512
00:42:23,668 --> 00:42:27,672
You're making a name for yourself
in Security Concepts with Robocop.

513
00:42:27,707 --> 00:42:29,674
I try.

514
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:31,634
Let me in on the bottom line, pal.

515
00:42:31,669 --> 00:42:33,594
I hear Jones was plenty pissed.

516
00:42:33,629 --> 00:42:37,598
You know, he's got this killer rep,
but it's a smoke screen.

517
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:41,644
He's lost his teeth.
The guy's a pussy.

518
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:43,771
Are we talking about
the same Dick Jones?

519
00:42:43,806 --> 00:42:47,775
He's old, we're young. That's life.

520
00:42:59,704 --> 00:43:03,666
I gotta go. I got a meeting.

521
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:14,677
Congratulations, Bob.

522
00:43:14,712 --> 00:43:16,721
Thanks.

523
00:43:16,756 --> 00:43:20,683
I remember when I was
a young executive at this company.

524
00:43:20,718 --> 00:43:23,686
We used to call
the old man funny names.

525
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:25,646
"Iron Butt."

526
00:43:25,681 --> 00:43:27,648
"Boner."

527
00:43:27,683 --> 00:43:30,735
Once I even called him...

528
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,655
..."asshole."

529
00:43:37,742 --> 00:43:39,660
But there was always respect.

530
00:43:39,695 --> 00:43:43,789
I always knew
where the line was drawn.

531
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:48,794
And you just stepped over it,
buddy-boy.

532
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:51,797
You've insulted me.

533
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:54,675
And you've insulted this company
with your bastard creation.

534
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:57,762
I had a guaranteed
military sale with ED 209.

535
00:43:57,797 --> 00:43:59,722
Renovation program.

536
00:43:59,757 --> 00:44:01,807
Spare parts for 25 years.

537
00:44:01,842 --> 00:44:05,686
Who cares if it worked or not?

538
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:09,690
The old man thought
it was pretty important, Dick.

539
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,784
You know...

540
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:23,830
...he's a sweet old man.

541
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:27,875
And he means well.

542
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:31,838
But he's not gonna live forever.

543
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:35,800
And I'm number two around here.

544
00:44:35,835 --> 00:44:39,720
Pretty simple math, huh, Bob?

545
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:43,850
You just...

546
00:44:43,885 --> 00:44:46,894
...fucked with the wrong guy.

547
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:50,731
You're out of your fucking mind.

548
00:44:53,776 --> 00:44:56,737
You better pray...

549
00:44:56,772 --> 00:45:00,783
...that that unholy monster
of yours doesn't screw up.

550
00:45:19,886 --> 00:45:20,887
You hungry?

551
00:45:20,922 --> 00:45:24,849
No, thanks.

552
00:46:03,846 --> 00:46:07,892
Oh, no.

553
00:46:10,895 --> 00:46:13,815
Damn rebels blew up
the airport in Acapulco.

554
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:17,819
Great, we were going there next week.
Hey, what was that?

555
00:46:22,782 --> 00:46:24,700
Hey, look.

556
00:46:24,735 --> 00:46:28,704
Bucket-boy's online.

557
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:43,928
Hey. Hey!

558
00:46:43,963 --> 00:46:44,804
Halt. Stop!

559
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:46,931
Wait a minute!

560
00:46:46,966 --> 00:46:49,892
- What's going on?
- I don't know. He just left.

561
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:52,937
He just left?

562
00:46:52,972 --> 00:46:55,898
Roosevelt!

563
00:46:55,933 --> 00:46:59,819
We got a problem.

564
00:46:59,854 --> 00:47:01,863
Out of the way.

565
00:47:01,898 --> 00:47:05,783
Take a look at this.

566
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:10,830
Shit! Call Bob Morton.

567
00:47:18,713 --> 00:47:22,758
Jerry, book him.
I'll catch up with you later.

568
00:47:26,762 --> 00:47:27,847
Hello.

569
00:47:27,882 --> 00:47:30,808
I haven't really had a chance
to introduce myself.

570
00:47:30,843 --> 00:47:33,895
I'm Anne Lewis.

571
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:37,940
Do you have a name?

572
00:47:41,986 --> 00:47:45,948
How can I help you, Officer Lewis?

573
00:47:45,983 --> 00:47:48,951
That's not really what I meant.

574
00:47:48,986 --> 00:47:49,911
Don't you have a name?

575
00:47:49,946 --> 00:47:51,871
Hold it. Sign right here.

576
00:47:51,906 --> 00:47:54,874
You don't understand. I'm OCP.

577
00:47:54,909 --> 00:47:56,876
Murphy.

578
00:47:56,911 --> 00:48:00,838
It's you.

579
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,801
You really don't remember me?

580
00:48:05,836 --> 00:48:06,761
Excuse me.

581
00:48:06,796 --> 00:48:08,804
I have to go.

582
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:11,766
Somewhere, there is a crime happening.

583
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:13,893
Stop!

584
00:48:13,928 --> 00:48:16,854
- What did you talk to him about?
- Nothing.

585
00:48:16,889 --> 00:48:20,858
- Shit.
- Shit.

586
00:48:21,859 --> 00:48:22,944
Stop!

587
00:48:22,979 --> 00:48:26,948
Hey, you there! Stop!

588
00:48:30,993 --> 00:48:33,955
You're in a lot of trouble, officer.

589
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:35,957
Come on.

590
00:48:35,992 --> 00:48:38,960
I was assured full cooperation
by this precinct.

591
00:48:38,995 --> 00:48:41,879
One of your grunts screws it up,
I'll have your job!

592
00:48:41,914 --> 00:48:43,881
- What's the update?
- Hard to know.

593
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:47,802
- We have a glitch or what?
- He wasn't designed for somatic rest.

594
00:48:47,837 --> 00:48:49,929
He had a dream. A dream.

595
00:48:49,964 --> 00:48:51,848
This cop questioned him.

596
00:48:51,883 --> 00:48:54,725
I didn't question him.
I asked his name. He didn't know.

597
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,853
Oh, great.

598
00:48:56,888 --> 00:49:00,857
Let me make it clear. He doesn't
have a name, he has a program.

599
00:49:00,892 --> 00:49:01,899
He's product.

600
00:49:01,934 --> 00:49:04,944
- Is that clear?
- Sure.

601
00:49:04,979 --> 00:49:06,946
Pull him in.
Run a systems check, the works.

602
00:49:06,981 --> 00:49:09,866
Take him offline
because he had a dream?

603
00:49:09,901 --> 00:49:11,951
What, are you kidding?

604
00:49:11,986 --> 00:49:13,911
Let's get out of here.

605
00:49:13,946 --> 00:49:14,954
Listen, Reed.

606
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:16,956
Try to keep one thing in mind:

607
00:49:16,991 --> 00:49:19,917
This project doesn't concern cops.
It's classified.

608
00:49:19,952 --> 00:49:23,880
It's OCP. You got it, mister?

609
00:49:25,882 --> 00:49:27,884
Yeah, I got it.

610
00:49:27,919 --> 00:49:31,971
Good.

611
00:49:32,006 --> 00:49:33,890
Sorry, sarge.

612
00:49:33,925 --> 00:49:36,809
I fucked up.

613
00:49:36,844 --> 00:49:40,813
Forget it, kid.
This guy's a serious asshole.

614
00:50:11,969 --> 00:50:15,848
Give me all your money, bookworm,
or I blow your brains out.

615
00:50:21,896 --> 00:50:25,858
Now fill it up on number seven.

616
00:50:29,862 --> 00:50:33,866
Don't do nothing stupid, man.

617
00:50:33,901 --> 00:50:37,954
I'm a good shot.

618
00:50:37,989 --> 00:50:39,997
I can hit you from here.

619
00:50:52,051 --> 00:50:53,010
Hey, man...

620
00:50:53,045 --> 00:50:55,012
...what you reading in there?

621
00:50:59,976 --> 00:51:03,896
You a college boy or something?

622
00:51:04,939 --> 00:51:08,901
I'll bet you think you're smart.
Think you could outsmart a bullet?

623
00:51:10,862 --> 00:51:12,947
What do you say we find out, huh?

624
00:51:12,982 --> 00:51:16,868
I'm talking to you!
What do you say, huh?

625
00:51:16,903 --> 00:51:20,955
I'm talking to you!

626
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:25,001
Drop it.

627
00:51:26,002 --> 00:51:30,047
Dead or alive, you are coming with me.

628
00:51:33,009 --> 00:51:35,052
I know you.

629
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,762
You're dead.

630
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:44,687
We killed you.

631
00:51:44,722 --> 00:51:48,774
We killed you.

632
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:03,706
We killed you.

633
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:50,670
Who are you?

634
00:52:50,705 --> 00:52:54,590
Who are you?

635
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:09,689
Can I help you, sir?

636
00:53:09,724 --> 00:53:11,691
No.

637
00:53:11,726 --> 00:53:13,693
What is it exactly that you want?

638
00:53:15,778 --> 00:53:17,780
You can't enter here.

639
00:53:17,815 --> 00:53:20,783
Wait a second. Hey, just a minute.

640
00:53:20,818 --> 00:53:24,787
This is a restricted area.

641
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:32,712
He's in.

642
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:37,777
Murphy, it's you.

643
00:55:34,834 --> 00:55:38,754
Welcome, shopper. Let's take
a stroll through your new home.

644
00:55:38,789 --> 00:55:41,841
This is a one-family house
built by ZM Industries.

645
00:55:41,876 --> 00:55:43,759
Situated near schools and shops...

646
00:55:43,794 --> 00:55:47,763
...this progressive development
has a growth factor of seven.

647
00:56:09,702 --> 00:56:11,704
Wow.

648
00:56:11,739 --> 00:56:15,791
Can you do that, Dad?

649
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:25,801
Say, it doesn't matter
who cooks in your family...

650
00:56:25,836 --> 00:56:28,804
...because this kitchen
by Food Concepts...

651
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:30,806
...makes everything a snap.

652
00:56:50,743 --> 00:56:53,663
Dad.

653
00:56:53,698 --> 00:56:56,666
Come on, get your hat on.
Isn't he cute?

654
00:56:56,701 --> 00:57:00,753
Come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

655
00:57:18,855 --> 00:57:22,942
I really have to tell you something.

656
00:57:24,861 --> 00:57:28,781
I love you.

657
00:57:30,783 --> 00:57:32,869
The master bedroom.

658
00:57:32,904 --> 00:57:36,873
Functional space
with a touch of elegance.

659
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:41,711
Hey, have you thought it all over?
Why not make me an offer?

660
00:58:14,827 --> 00:58:18,915
Where is Clarence Boddicker?

661
00:58:23,836 --> 00:58:27,757
Okay.

662
00:58:31,761 --> 00:58:35,932
- Shit.
- Let's talk.

663
00:58:38,935 --> 00:58:42,855
Son of a bitch!

664
00:58:44,941 --> 00:58:48,861
There's just something
about the way it sounds:

665
00:58:48,896 --> 00:58:50,863
"Vice president."

666
00:58:50,898 --> 00:58:53,866
It just turns me on.

667
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:55,868
God, you girls are so great.

668
00:58:55,903 --> 00:58:57,870
I love to be with intelligent women.

669
00:58:57,905 --> 00:59:00,873
Smart is so sexy.

670
00:59:00,908 --> 00:59:02,875
I know.

671
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:05,878
Sometimes, I could just
think of something...

672
00:59:05,913 --> 00:59:09,882
...and it could just get me so horny.

673
00:59:10,883 --> 00:59:14,804
Yeah, well, a mind is
a terrible thing to waste.

674
00:59:15,805 --> 00:59:19,725
I get bored so easily.

675
00:59:20,726 --> 00:59:24,814
And you need lots
of stimulation, Bobby.

676
00:59:24,849 --> 00:59:26,816
Yes, I do.

677
00:59:26,851 --> 00:59:30,903
- Don't move.
- I won't.

678
00:59:34,907 --> 00:59:36,909
Bob, save some for me.

679
00:59:36,944 --> 00:59:40,997
Don't worry.

680
00:59:41,914 --> 00:59:45,918
Must be the champagne. Stay here.

681
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,927
How you doing?

682
00:59:54,962 --> 00:59:58,931
Bitches, leave.

683
00:59:58,966 --> 01:00:01,851
Gee, Bobby. Bye.

684
01:00:01,886 --> 01:00:04,770
You gonna call me?

685
01:00:04,805 --> 01:00:06,856
The fuck are you doing?

686
01:00:06,891 --> 01:00:09,859
Do you know who I am?

687
01:00:09,894 --> 01:00:13,863
If you think you'll get away
with this, you got...

688
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:18,951
Goddamn it!

689
01:00:18,986 --> 01:00:20,953
Stop!

690
01:00:20,988 --> 01:00:24,957
I'll give you anything you want.
Just, please, don't kill me.

691
01:00:28,961 --> 01:00:30,963
Hello, buddy-boy.

692
01:00:30,998 --> 01:00:32,965
Dick Jones here.

693
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,968
I guess you're on
your knees about now...

694
01:00:36,003 --> 01:00:38,888
...begging for your life.

695
01:00:38,923 --> 01:00:40,890
Pathetic.

696
01:00:40,925 --> 01:00:42,892
You don't feel so cocky now, do you?

697
01:00:42,927 --> 01:00:45,895
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll double it right now.

698
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:49,816
You know what the tragedy is here?

699
01:00:49,851 --> 01:00:52,902
We could have been friends.

700
01:00:52,937 --> 01:00:55,905
But you wouldn't go
through proper channels.

701
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:58,908
You went over my head.

702
01:00:58,943 --> 01:01:00,910
That hurt.

703
01:01:00,945 --> 01:01:04,997
But life goes on. It's an old story,
the fight for love and glory.

704
01:01:08,084 --> 01:01:11,003
It helps if you think of it as a game.

705
01:01:11,038 --> 01:01:14,006
Every game has a winner...

706
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:18,010
...and a loser.

707
01:01:23,933 --> 01:01:28,020
I'm cashing you out, Bob.

708
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:52,962
I don't think I want to pay that, Sal.

709
01:01:52,997 --> 01:01:57,049
I don't give a shit what you want.
I set the prices here.

710
01:01:57,084 --> 01:02:01,053
Listen, Sal, maybe you haven't heard.
I'm the guy who owns Detroit.

711
01:02:01,088 --> 01:02:04,056
You want space in my marketplace...

712
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:05,975
...you'll have to give me
a volume discount.

713
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:09,061
Not into discounts.

714
01:02:09,096 --> 01:02:12,899
Joe, show the man what we brought him
for Christmas.

715
01:02:19,906 --> 01:02:23,910
Think about it, chum.
Good business is where you find it.

716
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:34,921
Okay, let me try
to put this in perspective.

717
01:02:34,956 --> 01:02:37,924
You've killed a bunch of cops.

718
01:02:37,959 --> 01:02:42,011
Word around is that you've got a lot
of heavy connections downtown.

719
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:47,016
You make a lot of my friends nervous.

720
01:02:49,018 --> 01:02:51,020
A lot of people...

721
01:02:51,055 --> 01:02:54,023
...want to see a guy like me...

722
01:02:54,058 --> 01:02:56,108
...put a guy like you out of business.

723
01:02:56,143 --> 01:02:59,946
I don't know.

724
01:02:59,981 --> 01:03:03,950
Maybe I'm just not
making myself clear.

725
01:03:04,951 --> 01:03:08,955
I don't want to fuck with you, Sal.

726
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:11,040
But I got the connections.

727
01:03:11,075 --> 01:03:13,960
I got the sales organization.

728
01:03:13,995 --> 01:03:16,963
I got the muscle
to shove enough of this factory...

729
01:03:16,998 --> 01:03:19,966
...so far up your stupid wop ass...

730
01:03:20,001 --> 01:03:21,968
...that you'll shit snow for a year.

731
01:03:22,003 --> 01:03:26,055
Frankie,
blow this cocksucker's head off.

732
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:29,976
Guns, guns, guns!

733
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,061
Come on, Sal!

734
01:03:32,096 --> 01:03:36,065
The Tigers are playing tonight.

735
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:40,987
I never miss a game.

736
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:47,994
Just kidding.

737
01:03:59,005 --> 01:04:03,009
Go!

738
01:04:23,112 --> 01:04:27,116
Come quietly,
or there will be trouble.

739
01:04:28,117 --> 01:04:32,038
Fuck you!

740
01:05:43,025 --> 01:05:47,029
Oh, shit!

741
01:06:06,132 --> 01:06:08,134
Clarence Boddicker...

742
01:06:08,169 --> 01:06:10,136
...you are under arrest.

743
01:06:10,171 --> 01:06:13,139
You have the right to remain silent.

744
01:06:13,174 --> 01:06:17,143
Fuck you!

745
01:06:20,146 --> 01:06:22,064
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!

746
01:06:22,099 --> 01:06:24,984
I'm protected, man.
I've got protection!

747
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:28,988
- You have the right to an attorney.
- What is this shit?!

748
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:33,993
Goddamn it.

749
01:06:34,028 --> 01:06:38,164
Goddamn it! Listen to me!
Listen to me, you fuck!

750
01:06:38,199 --> 01:06:42,168
It's another guy! He's OCP.
He's the senior president.

751
01:06:43,169 --> 01:06:46,172
Anything you say
may be used against you.

752
01:06:46,207 --> 01:06:50,259
It's Dick Jones!

753
01:06:52,178 --> 01:06:56,182
Don't you care, you cocksucker?

754
01:06:56,217 --> 01:06:58,184
I work for Dick Jones!

755
01:06:58,219 --> 01:07:00,102
Dick Jones!

756
01:07:00,137 --> 01:07:04,190
He's the number two guy at OCP!
OCP runs the cops!

757
01:07:06,108 --> 01:07:10,112
You're a cop!

758
01:07:11,197 --> 01:07:12,114
Cop...

759
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:27,213
Yes, I am a cop.

760
01:07:30,132 --> 01:07:32,218
I don't like it either, but listen!

761
01:07:32,253 --> 01:07:34,220
You listen to me, asshole!

762
01:07:34,255 --> 01:07:38,307
You're talking about shutting down
a major metropolitan police force!

763
01:07:38,342 --> 01:07:41,227
Without cops,
this city would tear itself apart!

764
01:07:41,262 --> 01:07:44,230
The union voted for a strike
last night!

765
01:07:44,265 --> 01:07:45,148
We lost five guys last week!

766
01:07:45,183 --> 01:07:49,152
We're getting creamed out there.

767
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,162
Book him.

768
01:07:59,197 --> 01:08:03,082
What's the charge?

769
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:08,171
He's a cop killer.

770
01:08:12,175 --> 01:08:14,177
Shit!

771
01:08:14,212 --> 01:08:18,181
Just give me my fucking phone call.

772
01:08:25,271 --> 01:08:28,274
I understand. The lawyers
will have you out in 24 hours.

773
01:08:28,309 --> 01:08:31,194
Just don't say anything else.

774
01:08:31,229 --> 01:08:35,198
Jesus, you really screwed up.

775
01:09:36,175 --> 01:09:37,176
Don't you care?

776
01:09:37,211 --> 01:09:41,180
I work for Dick Jones! Dick Jones!

777
01:09:43,182 --> 01:09:46,185
I work for Dick Jones!

778
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:50,189
He runs OCP! OCP runs the cops!

779
01:09:53,109 --> 01:09:55,278
Come in, officer.

780
01:09:55,313 --> 01:09:57,280
I don't usually see anyone
without an appointment...

781
01:09:57,315 --> 01:09:59,198
...but in your case,
I'll make an exception.

782
01:09:59,233 --> 01:10:01,284
You are under arrest.

783
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:03,286
On what charge?

784
01:10:03,321 --> 01:10:05,288
Aiding and abetting a known felon.

785
01:10:06,372 --> 01:10:10,209
Sounds like I'm in a lot of trouble.

786
01:10:11,294 --> 01:10:12,211
Better take me in.

787
01:10:12,246 --> 01:10:14,297
I will.

788
01:10:27,143 --> 01:10:31,230
What's the matter, officer?

789
01:10:31,265 --> 01:10:34,233
I'll tell you what's the matter.

790
01:10:34,268 --> 01:10:38,237
It's a little insurance policy
called "Directive 4."

791
01:10:38,272 --> 01:10:42,408
My little contribution
to your psychological profile.

792
01:10:42,443 --> 01:10:46,329
Any attempt to arrest a senior officer
of OCP results in shutdown.

793
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:54,337
What did you think?

794
01:10:54,372 --> 01:10:57,256
That you were
an ordinary police officer?

795
01:10:57,291 --> 01:10:58,257
You're our product...

796
01:10:58,292 --> 01:11:02,261
...and we can't have our products
turning against us.

797
01:11:06,098 --> 01:11:10,269
Still a little fight left in you.

798
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:18,152
Maybe you'd like to meet
a friend of mine.

799
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:26,285
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

800
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,373
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

801
01:12:39,358 --> 01:12:43,196
Get me Hedgecock!
There's trouble in the tower!

802
01:13:54,433 --> 01:13:57,353
Prepare to fire.

803
01:13:57,388 --> 01:14:00,439
- Wait a second!
- He's a cop, for God's sake!

804
01:14:00,474 --> 01:14:03,359
- You can't do that!
- We have orders to destroy it!

805
01:14:03,394 --> 01:14:05,444
- Oh, shit!
- You're maniacs!

806
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:09,365
Fire at will!

807
01:14:25,298 --> 01:14:29,302
Move in!

808
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,446
Murphy, it's me.

809
01:15:31,447 --> 01:15:35,451
Lewis.

810
01:15:46,379 --> 01:15:49,423
Level three! He's on level three!

811
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:50,383
Over here, over here!

812
01:15:50,418 --> 01:15:54,220
Open fire!

813
01:16:10,403 --> 01:16:12,405
It's back.

814
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,449
Big is back.
Because bigger is better.

815
01:16:15,484 --> 01:16:19,370
6000 SUX,
an American tradition.

816
01:16:19,405 --> 01:16:22,498
Good evening.
I'm Jess Perkins with Casey Wong.

817
01:16:22,533 --> 01:16:24,500
Top story: Santa Barbara.

818
01:16:24,535 --> 01:16:26,502
Ten thousand acres
of wooded residential land...

819
01:16:26,537 --> 01:16:29,505
...were scorched in an instant
when a laser canon...

820
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:32,425
...aboard the Strategic Defense
Peace Platform...

821
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:35,428
...misfired today
during routine tests.

822
01:16:35,463 --> 01:16:37,430
It was a day of mourning
for the families...

823
01:16:37,465 --> 01:16:40,308
...of 113 people known dead
at this hour.

824
01:16:40,343 --> 01:16:42,310
Among them, two former
U.S. presidents...

825
01:16:42,345 --> 01:16:45,438
...who had retired
in the Santa Barbara area.

826
01:16:45,473 --> 01:16:47,273
A day of mourning for a country.

827
01:16:47,308 --> 01:16:51,360
Police union representatives and OCP
continued negotiations today...

828
01:16:51,395 --> 01:16:55,531
...in hopes of averting
a citywide strike by police...

829
01:16:55,566 --> 01:16:58,451
...scheduled to begin
tomorrow at midnight.

830
01:16:58,486 --> 01:16:59,368
Justin Ballard-Watkins has more.

831
01:16:59,403 --> 01:17:02,455
They're still on duty.
But what about tomorrow?

832
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:06,501
That's the question we put to people
in the crime-plagued Lexington area.

833
01:17:06,536 --> 01:17:09,420
They're public servants.
They got job security.

834
01:17:09,455 --> 01:17:11,506
They're not supposed to strike.

835
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:13,549
It's a free society.

836
01:17:13,584 --> 01:17:17,553
Except there ain't nothing free,
because there's no guarantees.

837
01:17:17,588 --> 01:17:21,474
You're on your own.
That's the law of the jungle.

838
01:17:24,393 --> 01:17:28,439
- Be very careful.
- Excuse me, please.

839
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:33,402
Remodeling.

840
01:17:36,405 --> 01:17:39,492
Hi, Barbara.

841
01:17:39,527 --> 01:17:42,411
Listen, I'm here to see Dick Jones.

842
01:17:42,446 --> 01:17:45,498
But when I'm done,
I've got some free time.

843
01:17:45,533 --> 01:17:49,418
Maybe you could fit me in.

844
01:17:50,419 --> 01:17:54,507
He's expecting you, Mr. Boddicker.

845
01:17:56,384 --> 01:18:00,513
You can keep the gum.

846
01:18:05,518 --> 01:18:08,521
Hey, Dickie-boy. How's tricks?

847
01:18:08,556 --> 01:18:10,523
That thing is still alive.

848
01:18:10,558 --> 01:18:12,525
What are you talking about?

849
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,445
The police officer who arrested you,
the one you spilled your guts to.

850
01:18:17,238 --> 01:18:21,200
Take a look at my face, Dick.
He was trying to kill me.

851
01:18:23,202 --> 01:18:26,205
He's a cyborg, you idiot!

852
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:29,208
He recorded every word you said.

853
01:18:29,243 --> 01:18:32,295
His memory's admissible as evidence!

854
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:36,299
You involved me!

855
01:18:36,334 --> 01:18:40,344
You'll have to kill it.

856
01:18:41,387 --> 01:18:44,223
Well, listen, chief.

857
01:18:44,258 --> 01:18:48,311
Your company built the fucking thing.

858
01:18:48,346 --> 01:18:50,313
Now I gotta deal with it?

859
01:18:50,348 --> 01:18:53,316
I don't have time for this bullshit!

860
01:18:53,351 --> 01:18:57,236
Suit yourself. But Delta City
begins construction in two months.

861
01:18:57,271 --> 01:19:00,323
That's 2 million workers
living in trailers.

862
01:19:00,358 --> 01:19:04,243
That means drugs,
gambling, prostitution.

863
01:19:05,286 --> 01:19:09,165
Virgin territory for the man
who knows how to open up new markets.

864
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,168
One man could control it all...

865
01:19:12,203 --> 01:19:15,254
...Clarence.

866
01:19:15,289 --> 01:19:19,342
Well, I guess we're gonna
be friends after all.

867
01:19:19,377 --> 01:19:23,221
Richard.

868
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:30,311
Destroy it.

869
01:19:30,346 --> 01:19:34,357
Gonna need some major firepower.

870
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:39,278
You got access to military weaponry?

871
01:19:39,313 --> 01:19:43,282
We practically are the military.

872
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:21,487
Did you bring the gun?

873
01:20:21,522 --> 01:20:25,408
The precinct was deserted. Half the
force didn't show up for work today.

874
01:20:25,443 --> 01:20:29,412
Everyone else walks out at midnight.
I guess we're on strike.

875
01:20:29,447 --> 01:20:31,330
I wasn't sure what you needed.

876
01:20:31,365 --> 01:20:35,334
I sort of grabbed things.

877
01:20:35,369 --> 01:20:38,296
Your gun.

878
01:20:38,331 --> 01:20:42,258
You asked for this?

879
01:20:44,218 --> 01:20:47,180
I brought you some food.

880
01:20:47,215 --> 01:20:49,265
No, thank you.

881
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:53,269
I'm not hungry.

882
01:21:13,414 --> 01:21:17,376
You may not like
what you're going to see.

883
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:55,373
It's really good
to see you again, Murphy.

884
01:21:58,459 --> 01:22:02,421
Murphy had a wife and son.
Where are they?

885
01:22:03,464 --> 01:22:05,424
Well, after the funeral...

886
01:22:05,459 --> 01:22:09,345
...she moved away.
- Where did they go?

887
01:22:10,429 --> 01:22:12,348
She thought you were dead.

888
01:22:12,383 --> 01:22:16,352
She started over again.

889
01:22:16,387 --> 01:22:20,356
I can feel them.

890
01:22:22,275 --> 01:22:26,362
But I can't remember them.

891
01:22:30,366 --> 01:22:34,287
Leave me alone.

892
01:23:19,499 --> 01:23:23,419
Happy birthday, Dave. She's from me.

893
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:27,423
Well, hey, can I have you both?

894
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:29,425
Sure!

895
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:32,428
We've had our shots.

896
01:23:32,463 --> 01:23:36,474
I'd buy that for a dollar.

897
01:23:40,436 --> 01:23:43,356
Hey, Emil. How's the Gray Bar Hotel?

898
01:23:43,391 --> 01:23:47,527
Not bad. They let me keep the shirt.
And nobody popped my cherry.

899
01:23:47,562 --> 01:23:51,447
Emil, how you doing, man?
Good to see you.

900
01:23:51,482 --> 01:23:55,368
I get out of jail for free, then
I find this in the prison parking lot.

901
01:23:56,410 --> 01:24:00,456
A brand-new 6000 SUX.
Still got the factory sticker on it!

902
01:24:00,491 --> 01:24:02,375
Hey, Clarence!

903
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:05,461
Joey's got a car just like yours, man!

904
01:24:05,496 --> 01:24:09,382
Clarence, what do you think, buddy?

905
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:17,473
What do you got there, Clarence, huh?

906
01:24:17,508 --> 01:24:21,561
Whoa, a new toy. Can I play?

907
01:24:24,564 --> 01:24:25,606
Watch this.

908
01:24:25,641 --> 01:24:29,443
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

909
01:24:30,486 --> 01:24:34,490
Aw, shit!

910
01:24:34,525 --> 01:24:36,492
- Fuck!
- Nice car, Joe.

911
01:24:36,527 --> 01:24:38,411
- Fuck you, Clarence.
- Let me try that.

912
01:24:38,446 --> 01:24:42,498
Cobra assault canon.
State-of-the-art. Bang, bang.

913
01:24:49,505 --> 01:24:51,382
I like it!

914
01:24:51,417 --> 01:24:55,428
- Give it up, faggot little man.
- Get your own!

915
01:24:55,463 --> 01:24:59,515
Come on!

916
01:25:07,523 --> 01:25:11,527
Do it, Emil!

917
01:25:15,531 --> 01:25:19,452
Check this out!
Heads up, you guys!

918
01:25:27,376 --> 01:25:29,462
He's in the steel mill. Let's go.

919
01:25:29,497 --> 01:25:32,381
All right, cut the horseshit!
We're moving out.

920
01:25:32,416 --> 01:25:34,425
Come on, Emil!
Get your ass in the van.

921
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,469
Come on, lard-ass! Let's move it!

922
01:25:36,504 --> 01:25:40,348
Forget you, faggot!

923
01:26:32,441 --> 01:26:35,528
What are you doing?

924
01:26:35,563 --> 01:26:39,615
My targeting system
is a little messed up.

925
01:26:41,534 --> 01:26:43,536
Can I help you?

926
01:26:43,571 --> 01:26:47,623
Aim for me.

927
01:26:56,507 --> 01:27:00,553
- Are you locked in now?
- Yes.

928
01:27:00,588 --> 01:27:02,388
A little more to the left.

929
01:27:02,423 --> 01:27:06,559
Here.

930
01:27:12,482 --> 01:27:16,569
- I figure that's dead-on.
- Thank you.

931
01:27:33,586 --> 01:27:37,507
Come on, man, let's smoke him!

932
01:27:37,542 --> 01:27:40,551
The wrecking crew is here!
Where is that mother...?

933
01:27:40,586 --> 01:27:43,513
Give that up, man!

934
01:27:43,548 --> 01:27:46,516
Nothing fancy. Just kill him. Emil!

935
01:27:46,551 --> 01:27:50,520
- What?
- In the van.

936
01:27:50,555 --> 01:27:54,607
- You should get out of here now.
- Hey, we're partners.

937
01:27:55,525 --> 01:27:59,529
Get the car.

938
01:28:33,646 --> 01:28:34,564
Damn it. Shit!

939
01:28:34,599 --> 01:28:38,484
Looking for me?

940
01:28:49,495 --> 01:28:50,454
Cut him off!

941
01:28:50,489 --> 01:28:54,584
Come on! Go on! Cut him off! Go, go!

942
01:29:25,531 --> 01:29:29,535
Okay! Now I got you!

943
01:30:30,596 --> 01:30:32,682
Help me.

944
01:30:32,717 --> 01:30:36,727
Don't touch me, man!

945
01:30:36,762 --> 01:30:40,648
Help me.

946
01:30:56,706 --> 01:31:00,585
Shit!

947
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:29,739
- Bye-bye, baby.
- Clarence!

948
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:56,599
Okay.

949
01:31:56,634 --> 01:31:57,600
I give up.

950
01:31:57,635 --> 01:31:59,602
I'm not arresting you anymore.

951
01:31:59,637 --> 01:32:03,606
Hey. Now, wait a second.

952
01:32:08,611 --> 01:32:12,615
Wait a minute. You're taking
this kind of personal.

953
01:32:13,699 --> 01:32:14,700
Come on, man.

954
01:32:14,735 --> 01:32:18,621
You're making me nervous.
Come on, you can't do this.

955
01:32:18,656 --> 01:32:22,792
Come on now! Don't mess around!
Hey. Hey!

956
01:32:22,827 --> 01:32:26,712
Now, don't get cute!

957
01:32:29,715 --> 01:32:30,716
Die, you bastard!

958
01:32:30,751 --> 01:32:33,719
Yeah! Yeah!

959
01:32:33,754 --> 01:32:35,638
All right! All right!

960
01:32:35,673 --> 01:32:39,642
I got him, Clarence! I got him!

961
01:33:05,751 --> 01:33:09,755
Sayonara, Robocop!

962
01:33:22,685 --> 01:33:29,692
Lewis!

963
01:33:29,727 --> 01:33:33,696
Murphy, I'm a mess.

964
01:33:35,698 --> 01:33:37,700
They'll fix you.

965
01:33:37,735 --> 01:33:41,704
They fix everything.

966
01:33:49,712 --> 01:33:51,881
The police strike could work for us.

967
01:33:51,916 --> 01:33:54,801
We can have ED 209s
in place all over the city...

968
01:33:54,836 --> 01:33:56,803
...and expect immediate
public support.

969
01:33:56,838 --> 01:34:00,723
I've got one downstairs
guarding the building now.

970
01:34:07,647 --> 01:34:10,650
You're illegally parked
on private property.

971
01:34:10,685 --> 01:34:14,737
You have 20 seconds
to move your vehicle.

972
01:34:48,771 --> 01:34:50,773
Whatever happens...

973
01:34:50,808 --> 01:34:53,693
...this corporation will live up
to its guiding principles:

974
01:34:53,728 --> 01:34:57,697
Courage, strength, conviction.

975
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:04,620
We will meet each new challenge
with the same aggressive attitude.

976
01:35:14,797 --> 01:35:16,799
How can we help you, officer?

977
01:35:16,834 --> 01:35:19,719
Dick Jones is wanted for murder.

978
01:35:19,754 --> 01:35:23,806
This is absurd! That thing is
a violent mechanical psychopath!

979
01:35:24,807 --> 01:35:28,811
My program will not allow me to act
against an officer of this company.

980
01:35:28,846 --> 01:35:32,732
These are serious charges.
What is your evidence?

981
01:35:42,742 --> 01:35:46,746
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

982
01:35:46,781 --> 01:35:50,750
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

983
01:35:50,785 --> 01:35:54,754
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

984
01:35:54,789 --> 01:35:58,758
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

985
01:36:01,761 --> 01:36:03,763
I want a chopper! Now!

986
01:36:03,798 --> 01:36:06,766
We will walk to the roof very calmly.

987
01:36:06,801 --> 01:36:10,770
I will board the chopper
with my hostage.

988
01:36:11,771 --> 01:36:15,775
Anybody tries to stop me...

989
01:36:15,810 --> 01:36:19,862
...the old geezer gets it.

990
01:36:19,897 --> 01:36:23,866
Dick, you're fired!

991
01:36:23,901 --> 01:36:27,870
Thank you.

992
01:36:50,893 --> 01:36:54,814
Nice shooting, son. What's your name?

993
01:36:55,815 --> 01:36:59,819
Murphy.
