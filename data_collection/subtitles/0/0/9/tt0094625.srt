1
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Groups of unemployed workers, who have
grown in number due to the tax reforms...

2
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,900
...enacted by the former Prime Minister,
are rioting all across the country.

3
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,800
And with the confusion among members of
parliament sparked by the comments of...

4
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,400
...Finance Minister Takanashi
during a recent parliament inquiry,

5
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,200
there seems to be no compromise insight
between the government and opposition.

6
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,000
Hey. What'll it be?

7
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,200
Give me three peanuts.

8
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,700
Let's see here...

9
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,700
We've herded those Clown
bastards onto Route 5.

10
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,700
Damn it, don't scare me like that!
Open the damn door quietly!

11
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
You wouldn't be so jumpy if you
didn't have something to hide!

12
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,700
Try selling some normal
drinks sometime, huh?

13
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,800
How about buying something for once?!
This ain't a hangout!

14
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,500
And drink that dog piss you sell?!

15
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,100
Twin ceramic rotor
drives on each wheel...

16
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,400
And these are... Computer
controlled anti-lock brakes...

17
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,900
200 horsepower at 12,000 rpm...

18
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,700
You wanna ride it, Tetsuo?

19
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,100
All right, let's go!

20
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,600
That bike's been customized just for me.
It's too wild. You couldn't handle it.

21
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,200
I don't see how you can ride
something like that, man.

22
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,000
I could!

23
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,400
If you want one so bad,
steal a big one for yourself.

24
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Unbelievable.

25
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,700
School kids these days...

26
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,000
Wait! Hey, waiter!

27
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,000
They ran into the alley! After 'em!

28
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,100
This isn't a game, you idiot!

29
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,800
Shit...!

30
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,000
That's--

31
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,600
This is car 375.

32
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,200
We've got reports of biker gangs fighting
near the intersection of Highway 14 south!

33
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,800
Request immediate assistance!
Car 375, en route to the scene!

34
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,600
It's the cops! What should we do?

35
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,400
Damn, and my motor coils
were just getting warmed up...

36
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,500
Bastards...

37
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,500
Let's go, Tetsuo!

38
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,800
Right!

39
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Damn!

40
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,400
A skirmish has broken out
between student protesters...

41
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,400
...and riot police assigned a security.
There appear to be some casualties.

42
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,700
Furthermore--

43
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,700
What the--?

44
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,300
What the hell's going on?!

45
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,000
Move it, jerk!
I'm in a hurry!

46
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,300
What was that?!

47
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,700
Call the police!

48
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Repeal the tax reforms!

49
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,500
This area is off-limits!
Go back! It's dangerous!

50
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,200
Something's strange here...

51
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,300
Let me through!
I'm sorry, let me through!

52
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,500
What's the big idea?

53
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,200
Look! Blood!

54
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,900
Who are they?

55
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,100
- Excuse me.
- Hey! Don't push!

56
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,700
- Excuse me.
- Hey! Watch it, jerk!

57
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,000
Pardon me. I'm sorry.

58
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,700
Ryu!

59
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,400
Hey! He ran away!

60
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,700
He's got a gun!

61
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,600
Fire!

62
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,600
Hold your fire!
There's a kid with him!

63
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,100
Run...

64
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,500
Hurry...

65
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,500
Go to Ryu...

66
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,100
Ryu will help you now...

67
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,700
Hurry... Get out of here...

68
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,100
Kei!

69
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,100
What are you doing? Hurry!

70
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,400
He vanished...!

71
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,700
He's to the west.

72
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,300
The west? He's in
the old city, then.

73
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Eat this!

74
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,800
Tetsuo!

75
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,300
Ryu! Ryu, where are you?

76
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,400
Kei!

77
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,300
No, that's--!

78
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,200
How you like that?!

79
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,000
Well? Who is it?

80
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,100
It's not him!
It's not Tetsuo!

81
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,200
Okay! Let's go!

82
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,100
You little...
What did you do...?

83
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Tetsuo!
Hang on! Hey!

84
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,100
Huh? What did you say?

85
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,200
That kid...

86
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,400
He's hurt bad!

87
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,900
Hey! Wait!

88
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,200
We gotta get him to a hospital!

89
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,200
- He needs an ambulance!
- We can't move him!

90
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,700
W-What the hell?!

91
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,600
There's no escape.

92
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,700
We've come for you.

93
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,800
We can't survive on the outside.
Come on, let's go home.

94
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,800
It's the army!
Those are army helicopters!

95
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,300
Move out!

96
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,300
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!

97
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,500
Um... We're just, uh...

98
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,800
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!

99
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,500
Ow... Damn it, that hurts!

100
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,900
Kai!

101
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,600
- Hey!
- Sir?
- Who are they?

102
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,700
They seem to be an
ordinary bike gang, sir.

103
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,600
We're going back.

104
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,500
Ow! Hey, wait a minute!

105
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,500
My arms don't bend that way, damn it!

106
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Load the wounded onto the helicopter!

107
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Tetsuo!

108
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,500
Wait! Where are you taking him?

109
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,400
Kaneda!

110
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,800
What the hell?
We didn't do anything!

111
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,000
He's heavy...!

112
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:13,000
So you and your friends went out at night
on your bikes to visit your dying mother,

113
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,100
and a group of hooligans called the
Clowns picked a fight with you.

114
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,800
They hurt your friend,
so you lost your temper,

115
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,600
which is why eight Clown
members are now in the hospital.

116
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,900
That's your story?

117
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
She's cute!

118
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,100
Hey! You can't look at this!

119
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,700
And how's your mother doing?!

120
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,300
Huh? Oh.

121
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,600
Luckily, she made it through
the worst of it last night.

122
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,800
And I suppose she's made it over
the mountains on a bike by now?

123
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,700
It couldn't be these bozos.

124
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,300
You can tell that just by looking.

125
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,500
Wait on that bench. Understand?

126
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,000
How much longer are we
gonna have to wait?

127
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,200
Okay! The next five,
come get in here!

128
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,900
So the army's working
with the police...

129
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,000
...to hunt down anti-government
groups now, huh?

130
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,800
- Wanna put up a fight, huh?
- He's holding something!

131
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,100
Bastard!

132
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,700
Long live the freedom revolution!

133
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,400
He's got a grenade!

134
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,900
Crazy son of a bitch!

135
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,400
All right, that's enough!
Take him away!

136
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,300
We'll really teach him a lesson later.

137
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,900
You dumb bastard! If you wanna die,
just hang yourself or something!

138
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,300
Hey! You people can go.
We've contacted your school.

139
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,600
What? You son of a--

140
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,900
Hey, hold on a minute, pops!

141
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,500
"pops"?!

142
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,300
There was one more of us.

143
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,800
- What?
- Pardon me.

144
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,200
What're you--

145
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
This is her.
Can she leave with us?

146
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,300
Who are you calling " Pops," you punk?

147
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,500
Ow!

148
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,700
Look here, kid! I'm only 25!
I'm not even married!

149
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,500
So watch your mouth!
She can go with you!

150
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,300
Call a doctor!

151
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,900
So I think the army was chasing
that weird kid Kaneda saw...

152
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,300
I think I saw him, too.

153
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,900
And what about Tetsuo?

154
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,500
Why the hell wouldn't they
tell us what hospital he's in?

155
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,000
What did you say?!

156
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,500
I was just wondering if you wanted to
grab some tea or something over there.

157
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,300
I figured we could have a nice,
long talk about that "revolution" deal.

158
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,700
Skirt-chasers will try
anything these days...

159
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,100
You'll help anyone so long
as it's a girl, won't you?

160
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,700
No way! I have high standards!

161
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,000
No way! I have high standards!

162
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,100
It's not their looks that count.

163
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,100
It's their... I dunno, their
sensitivity that makes me do it.

164
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,300
I suppose I owe you one.
Thank you very much, uh...

165
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,100
I'm Kaneda.
Nice to meet you.

166
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,300
See you around, Kaneda.

167
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,300
You're leaving already?
Don't be like that!

168
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,400
Hey, come on!
I did save you and all!

169
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,100
At least tell me your
name, you bitch!

170
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,100
I'll try talking with them for
the time being, but it's risky.

171
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,600
If they think you're trying to avoid taking
responsibility, it'll blow up in your face.

172
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,900
I can't believe that there's a
mole on the executive council.

173
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,300
Even if that's true...

174
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,500
That isn't important.

175
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,700
What's important is diplomacy and political
maneuvering, which you seem to despise.

176
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,300
I never studied them in school, you see.

177
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,400
I n any case, at the next
executive council meeting,

178
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,000
your poor management of this last
incident will be called into question.

179
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
There 's a phone call for the Colonel.

180
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,300
You should put your affairs in order.

181
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,100
It's me.

182
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,900
This way, Colonel.

183
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm terribly sorry to call you here,

184
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,900
but there's something
you really must see.

185
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,200
Please observe.

186
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,300
It's the special pattern
from that young boy.

187
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,400
It doesn't resemble
any I've seen so far,

188
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,400
and I've never seen a developmental
speed or confiiguration like this.

189
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,800
It may have begun with the shock of
contact with Number 26, or possibly...

190
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,800
Have you finished running a
comparison with Akira's pattern?

191
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,800
I'll superimpose it over this one.

192
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,600
This projection was constructed using
mixed data, so a comparison is difficult,

193
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,400
but I believe this boy's
pattern is the key to solving...

194
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,700
...the riddle of Akira's
pattern growth process.

195
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,000
All right. Continue.

196
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
Very well, sir. Thank you.

197
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,200
I'm sure he'll turn out to be a
worthy addition to the Numbers.

198
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,000
It may be rough on him,

199
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,200
but I thought we might try starting
him off with level 7 capsules.

200
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,500
Is it safe?

201
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,900
Leave everything to me.

202
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That's not what I meant!

203
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm asking that if he turns out to
have power like Akira's like you said,

204
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,300
will we be able to control it?

205
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,500
Well, that's--

206
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,700
Can I leave this to you?

207
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,200
Well, if we use the latest examination
equipment to collect even more data...

208
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,800
...and do a multifaceted
analysis, then surely...

209
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,800
Maybe we shouldn't
touch that power.

210
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The power of God?

211
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,800
A... ki... ra...

212
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:35,400
But we have to.
We have to touch it and control it.

213
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,000
If it looks like it's too much for us
to handle, terminate him at once!

214
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,600
There can be no hesitation!

215
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,500
Very well, Colonel.

216
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,600
This school is your last chance!

217
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,800
If trash like you that can't keep up with
the academic ability of regular students...

218
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,600
...and can't adapt to living in a group
screw up here, it's the end of the road!

219
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,500
Even if you're under 15, if you get more
than 50 penalty points on your record,

220
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,800
you're sent to the regular courts!

221
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,400
Bite me! Don't mess
with us, you bald goat!

222
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,100
Aren't any of you listening?

223
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,500
You lost me halfway through!

224
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,800
Discipline!

225
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,000
Discipline!

226
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,500
- Discipline!
- OW!

227
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,700
Discipline!

228
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,000
Discipline!

229
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,200
Discipline!

230
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Dismissed!

231
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,300
Thank you very much, sir!

232
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,300
You bastard! You and me are
gonna go at it someday, jack!

233
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
We're gonna remember this!

234
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,600
I hope you rot and die!

235
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,200
You sick bastard!

236
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
Shit...

237
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,500
Yamagata!

238
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,500
What happened to your cheek?

239
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,700
Shut the hell up.

240
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,900
Let me guess, Jaws from P.E.?

241
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,800
They say you fought the Clowns
on a highway in the old city!

242
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,300
Yeah.

243
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,600
Why don't you just wipe 'em out?
Those guys are so gross!

244
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,200
And last night...

245
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,300
There were demonstrators,
cops, and even the damn army!

246
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,000
And that idiot Tetsuo
had an accident, too.

247
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,000
What happened to Tetsuo?

248
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,000
He's in the hospital, I guess,
but we don't know where.

249
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,300
The idiot was trying to show off.

250
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,500
That idiot...

251
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,200
What, you mean Tetsuo?

252
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,800
Shut up! I've had enough
of your damn flirting!

253
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,300
What's gotten into you?!

254
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,200
Tetsuo? It's time for your medication.

255
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,700
Doctor! There's a problem!

256
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,500
I can't. The dorm mother throws
a fit if you go out before 10.

257
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,500
Yeah, the one with the face like a goat.

258
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,500
That old bag's such a pain... She's
always yammering on and on and on.

259
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,300
Tomorrow at three?
Sure, that'd be okay.

260
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,400
Hey, what happened to
that girl a while back?

261
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,700
I don't like her much. Her personality
just gets on my nerves.

262
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,400
Kaori...

263
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,000
Tetsuo!

264
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,500
Everyone's been worried about you!
They thought you might be dead.

265
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,500
When I woke up, I was on an
operating table or something.

266
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,800
And that examination...

267
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,100
It's like... they were messing
around inside my head.

268
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
I don't want to go back there.

269
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,800
Let's run away...

270
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,300
Where?

271
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,300
Someplace. Someplace far away.

272
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,400
- What's your problem?
- That's mine!

273
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
I wanna get laid!

274
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,400
Hey! Today's independent study!

275
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,300
Say what? What about
my burning desire to study?!

276
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,600
Drag his butt in here!

277
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,300
Kaneda! Your bike!

278
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,700
My bike?

279
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Look!

280
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,000
Tetsuo!

281
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,800
Are you sure this is okay?

282
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,900
Shut up! Just keep
quiet and hang on!

283
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,400
Huh?
What's wrong?

284
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Shit!
Oh, no...

285
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,500
We're stopping...
We stopped.

286
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,300
Oh, okay. The engine can't drop below
5,000 even when you're changing gears.

287
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,500
- My butt hurts.
- Okay, I get it...

288
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,200
Look, bikes!

289
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,300
Is that Kaneda and...?

290
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,900
It's not them!

291
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,900
Kaori!

292
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,200
Any sign of him?

293
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
Kuwata and the others went
to look around Kisarazu.

294
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,000
All that's left now is
the industrial area!

295
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,800
Okay, let's go!

296
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,300
We owe you for the other night!

297
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,900
Shut up!

298
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,100
Kaori! What did they do, Kaori?!

299
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:38,100
Don't! If you so much as scratch
that bike, I'm gonna kill you!

300
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,500
Run!

301
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,800
Don't let 'em get away!

302
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,800
Wait!

303
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,900
Tetsuo!

304
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,500
That's enough, Tetsuo!
Are you trying to kill him?

305
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,600
Yes! I'm gonna kill him!
I'll split his damn head open!

306
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,200
Knock it off!.

307
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,000
This happened because you
took my bike for a joyride.

308
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,400
- Enough, already!
- Shut up! Don't order me around!

309
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,800
We were worried about you.

310
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,100
Why do you always have
to come and save me?

311
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I could've handled it myself!.
I admit I got beat up that one time,

312
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,800
but I won't always be
on the receiving end!

313
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,700
Understand?!

314
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Tetsuo...

315
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,500
Shut up! Stay away from me!

316
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,400
Hey, wait!
Where are you going?

317
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,400
Leave me alone!

318
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Akira!

319
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,300
Tetsuo!

320
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,600
What's wrong?

321
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,500
Akira!

322
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,100
I don't know who that is!

323
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,400
Tetsuo, are you...

324
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Hey!

325
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,800
This is strange.

326
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,000
I'm getting a blue
pattern on scope #3!

327
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,900
Oh, no! Retrieve
the subject! Hurry!

328
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,300
What're you doing to my friend?!

329
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,500
What's with you? You just
come back from a funeral?

330
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
Tetsuo!

331
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,300
Kaneda!

332
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,200
Shit...

333
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,000
Wait!

334
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,700
Hey, Kaneda...

335
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,100
I see we have some youngsters doing their
thing in spite of the tight checkpoints.

336
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,600
That just means that
they're stupid, don't it?

337
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,100
This is boring.
Hey, let's go home.

338
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,800
But it's still early!

339
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,700
Yeah, but without their bikes they're
just skirt-chasers out of water.

340
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You mean "fish"!

341
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,200
Come on, let's go.
Let's toss these fish back!

342
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,900
Hey, Kaneda, what're we gonna do?

343
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,700
What the--?

344
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,700
Look!

345
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,600
That's...

346
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,800
Here we go again... Let's get out of
here before we get involved again.

347
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Huh?

348
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Kaneda?

349
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,100
Hey!

350
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,400
This area is being cordoned off
due to a terrorist bombing.

351
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,900
Those who wish to get through,
line up in single file,

352
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,900
present your ID and go
through the checkpoint.

353
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Get in.

354
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,200
What's wrong? Hurry.
I'll be right behind you.

355
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,600
You know the rendezvous point, right?

356
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,100
- Be careful.
- You too, Ryu.

357
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,700
Stop! Stop, damn it!

358
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,700
She's got a gun!

359
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,700
Okay, that's far enough!

360
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,800
Drop the gun!

361
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,600
Drop it now!

362
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Stop!

363
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,600
I think it came from over here!

364
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,600
- There were two shots!
- No, three!

365
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,900
It's just up ahead!

366
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,500
Hey. Let's get out of here.

367
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Come on!

368
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,200
Kaneda!

369
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,200
So, what's the matter?
Try telling me about it.

370
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
I had a dream.

371
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,400
A dream?

372
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,600
The city will be covered by a dark
shadow and start to crumble.

373
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,500
Lots of people died...

374
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,700
...and we met Akira again.

375
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,400
Akira?!

376
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:16,900
The city will crumble,
and so many people will die...

377
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,600
When?! When will it happen, Kiyoko?!

378
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,000
You mustn't let that boy go.

379
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,800
His power, it...

380
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
What did she mean?!

381
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:40,800
Well, there's nothing
physically wrong with her.

382
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,100
Her medication is normal, too.

383
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,500
There's no sign of any abnormalities
in her ECG or EEG, either.

384
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,200
I think what Number 25 said was
her precognitive power at work.

385
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,700
This must be presented to the supreme
executive council for inquiry, but...

386
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,600
Do you believe her?

387
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,400
I have no doubts regarding
Number 25's abilities.

388
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,600
We have all sorts of data
that substantiate her abilities.

389
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,300
What about you, Colonel?

390
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,300
My job isn't to believe or disbelieve.
It's to act or not to act.

391
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,500
Here, sir.

392
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,000
Cold gear, Colonel.
Please put it on. You, too, Doctor.

393
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,900
The other day, a young
researcher asked me something.

394
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,900
He wondered if their power was the form the
next stage of human evolution was taking,

395
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,900
and perhaps that we'll all
be able to control it some day.

396
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,400
Scientists are a bunch of romantics.

397
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,800
Military men always
consider the risks first.

398
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,900
It's taken thirty long years.

399
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,100
We've come so far from the rubble.

400
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
We can't just trade one for the other.

401
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,700
I've always thought that you
hated this city, Colonel.

402
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,100
The passion to build has cooled and
the joy of reconstruction forgotten,

403
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,100
and now it's just a garbage heap
made up of hedonistic fools.

404
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,500
So you're trying to save the city, then.

405
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,700
It's how a soldier thinks.
A scientist wouldn't understand.

406
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,500
Colonel, we're here.

407
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
This way, sir.

408
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,100
Room 10, 148 degrees Kelvin.

409
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,400
Fluctuation tolerance range, check.

410
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,200
Room 9, 118 degrees Kelvin.
Fluctuation tolerance, check.

411
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,700
Emergency power generator, check.

412
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,500
- Open it.
- Yes, sir.

413
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:17,600
Uh...

414
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,000
Go to the Control Room!

415
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,100
Yes sir!

416
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:42,200
Room 1 is at 0.0005 degrees Kelvin.
It's within tolerances.

417
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,400
No abnormalities detected
in any of the rooms'...

418
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,500
...Dewar Walls or in
the defense system.

419
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,500
No abnormal atmospheric
concentrations or reactions recorded.

420
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,900
All systems nominal, then?

421
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,600
Look at what they abandoned
in their panic. They were afraid!

422
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,500
They were too scared, so they
hid it away from the public.

423
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,700
They forgot all shame and honor...

424
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,900
...and cast off the civilization
and science we had created,

425
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,700
and shut the lid of the Pandora's
Box they themselves had opened.

426
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,500
- Ryu!
- Hey, we're still young.

427
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,000
I think we can start over.

428
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,600
I'll go with you to the police.

429
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,400
- Ryu!
- Come on, turn yourself in!

430
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,700
That was the first time you
ever killed somebody, right?

431
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,400
Ryu!

432
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,200
Anyway, once you've
purified your body and soul,

433
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,100
Let's go out for tea or something.

434
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,800
Don't kick yourself over it, okay?

435
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,200
What's done is done.
The guy's dead.

436
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,900
Who're you?!

437
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,500
Ryu! You're okay!

438
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,400
- Kei, is that you?
- Ryu!

439
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,900
Who's this?

440
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,300
Who, me?

441
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:14,100
Well, I guess saying I'm Kei's
boyfriend might be stretching it a bit.

442
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,000
But we haven't gotten physical
or anything yet, understand?

443
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,300
- Are you a spy?!
- No!

444
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,500
Liar!

445
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,700
Is he really okay?

446
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,000
All I know for sure is
that he's not a spy.

447
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,500
Ow...

448
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,000
Sneak into their lab?!

449
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,400
Are you serious? Don't you remember
the fiasco with that kid?!

450
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,600
Last-minute orders.
Besides, the plan's already in place.

451
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,200
The lab passes they
issue once a week...

452
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,500
They're from Mr. Nezu?

453
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,400
What's the objective?

454
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,100
Detailed data on the new subject.

455
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,000
New subject?

456
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Yes. Last week, on the night we tried
to abduct the subject called Number 26,

457
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,100
a boy who was in an accident on an
old city highway was brought to the lab.

458
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,300
Looks like he's a student at
a vocational training school,

459
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,600
but he's now their new subject
for human experimentation.

460
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,100
Ow!

461
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,100
OW! What's the big idea?!

462
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,400
- You!
- He heard us! Let's kill him!

463
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,300
Ryu!

464
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:30,100
W-Wait a minute! Listen to me!
Listen to what I have to say!

465
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,500
He saved me!

466
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,600
Twice!

467
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,700
Maybe it was just to get close to us.

468
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,400
The guy who was in that accident in
the old city is a friend of mine!

469
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,400
I know it's hard to believe,
but it's the truth!

470
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,500
I was there when it happened!

471
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,600
Don't they say the only foolish
questions are unasked ones?

472
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,900
Huh? They don't?

473
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,700
That's an intriguing story.

474
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,300
Will you be taking the boy with you?

475
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,800
He knows the subject, and I think we
can use him as a decoy if necessary.

476
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,900
Neo Tokyo is going to change.

477
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,300
I n all respects, this city is saturated.
It's like an overripe fruit.

478
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,200
And within it is a new seed.

479
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,400
We only need to wait for the
wind which will make it fall.

480
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,500
The wind called Akira!

481
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,700
Ryu, look!

482
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,600
What is it?

483
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,100
We aren't the ones who will change it,

484
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,900
but rather, those citizens
who hope for Akira will.

485
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,900
That which is called science
perverts providence!

486
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,700
That which is called progress
encourages extravagance!

487
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,800
That which is called civilization
devastates the spirit of man!

488
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,800
The time of a tonement is upon us!

489
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,100
The time of his awakening is nigh!

490
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,700
The time of Lord Akira's
awakening draws near!

491
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,000
Are your hearts prepared?!

492
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,100
Holding meetings
here is prohibited!

493
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,000
Break up this illegal gathering!

494
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,000
Terrorist activities carried out by...

495
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,400
...anti-government elements
have skyrocketed this month.

496
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,700
The army, riot police, and even traffiic
police have been fully mobilized.

497
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,100
The overtime costs alone have
used up the public safety budget.

498
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,700
And then there's the
abduction of Number 26!

499
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,600
Isn't their existence supposed
to be highest of state secrets?

500
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
No one's ever heard of "Peace and
Order" here in Neo Tokyo, then?

501
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,000
And then there's this request of yours...

502
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,900
...for further funding because of
subject Number 25's prediction.

503
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,600
You must be joking!

504
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,600
We Parliament members have been
begging the public to bear with us...

505
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:47,300
...while we straighten out the former Prime
Minister's historic tax reform blunders,

506
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,200
so where, exactly, are we supposed
to get that kind of money?!

507
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,800
You've spent a fortune, and all we have to
show for it is that grotesque kindergarten!

508
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,600
The Olympics are next year.
The postwar period is over.

509
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,100
How much longer will you keep
spending money on some ghost?!

510
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,500
I always said that we should've put
that money into the welfare program!

511
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,800
- Shut up, old man!
- What?!

512
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,100
That power is starting to walk
around free as we speak.

513
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,500
Unless we control it now,
we'll lose everything!

514
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,200
Who do you think you're
talking to, youngster?

515
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,000
It was your lack of policy that
started this mess in the first place!

516
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,600
There's still no proof that the last
World War was caused by Akira!

517
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,100
Won't you even try to
understand anything at all...

518
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,900
...unless an Akira disaster
actually happens?!

519
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,600
Has anyone actually seen this "Akira"?

520
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,600
Wasn't Akira Number 25?

521
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,500
No, I think he was Number 21...

522
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,100
The Colonel has lost sight
of his duty as a soldier.

523
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,200
I've had reports that anti-government
elements are using...

524
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:50,200
...this "Akira" madness of yours as an
excuse to whip up their terrorist fervor!

525
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,100
No! That's untrue!

526
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,200
Then what about that Akira
world renewal movement?

527
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,300
Wouldn't you say that
information's being leaked?

528
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,600
World renewal movement?
End of the world, more like!

529
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,500
Aren't you just using Akira as camouflage
to cover up your misconduct?

530
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,000
What are you getting at?

531
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:11,700
Colonel, we can no
longer leave the peace...

532
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,000
...of Neo Tokyo to your
sole discretion.

533
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,100
Right!

534
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,400
You are to be put before
an inquiry committee.

535
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,700
I agree!

536
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,700
Excuse me!

537
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,600
Colonel!
Colonel, where are you--

538
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,300
Wait! This discussion isn't over yet!

539
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,600
Explain yourself!.

540
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,700
Are you trying to insult the
supreme executive council?!

541
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:36,800
Colonel...!

542
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,300
Wait, Colonel!

543
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,200
W-Water...

544
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,800
Hey, wait a minute...

545
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,300
Isn't that cable replacement
scheduled for next week?

546
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,200
The cable they ordered came in early.

547
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,000
Besides, I'm going on vacation
at the end of the week.

548
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,700
Besides, I'm going on vacation
at the end of the week.

549
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,900
I've brought some workers with me, too.

550
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,700
I could take it back, but the work's
gonna be done sooner or later.

551
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,800
Okay, let's go.

552
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,800
What the--?

553
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,500
Milk?

554
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,100
Stay away!

555
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,300
- Blood!
- I'm scared!

556
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,800
jerk!

557
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,400
W-Who the hell are they?

558
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,600
Room 887, Tetsuo Shima...

559
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,800
A problem with the automatic lock?

560
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,900
Hey! You can't just walk
off from your room!

561
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,800
Come on, let's go back.

562
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,500
What the hell happened?
What a mess!

563
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,200
There are 58 blocks with circuits
that the computer won't display.

564
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:33,600
Of those, nearly 40 are concentrated
on underground levels 7 and 8.

565
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,500
That's probably the place.

566
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,200
The central wiring shaft
should be up ahead.

567
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,600
We should be able to use it to
go straight to the sublevels.

568
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,900
Be careful, it's deeper in the middle.

569
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,200
- What a stink!
- Quiet!

570
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,100
What? I said it stinks
because it stinks!

571
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,800
- Is your nose busted?
- Hurry up and stay quiet!

572
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,400
Damn! Hide!

573
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,800
Huh? Where?

574
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,400
What're you doing, you idiot?!

575
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
They left?

576
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,000
Looks like they've beefed up security.

577
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,600
Must be that siren we heard.

578
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,300
What should we do?
Scout around some?

579
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,500
No.

580
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,200
- Are you okay?
- Let's keep going.

581
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,300
I want to check out their
security at the very least.

582
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,700
All right.

583
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,800
We've been spotted! Run!

584
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,000
Shit!

585
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,100
Don't! Don't shoot!

586
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,300
Shimazaki! Shit!

587
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,700
Forget about him! Run!

588
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,300
What the hell is that?

589
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,300
Here it comes!

590
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,600
Forget it! You can't do any good!

591
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,800
Die!

592
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,700
This is Unit 304, Shaft H!

593
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,900
Have encountered intruders and
am engaging! Request backup!

594
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,200
Here it comes!

595
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,800
Kei!

596
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,500
Where's that gun?!

597
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,000
Damn it...!

598
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,800
Kaneda!

599
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,500
Kei, this way!

600
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,000
Hurry!

601
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,900
Kaneda, hurry!

602
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,600
Kaneda!

603
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,600
The brakes!
Where are the brakes?!

604
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,500
That's not it?

605
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,400
This is the central wiring shaft!

606
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,700
It's gotta be this one, then!

607
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,500
Okay, I'm getting the hang of this!

608
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,300
Ask the Colonel for
clearance to fire!

609
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,100
- Turn that up!
- There must be some mistake.

610
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,500
That boy looks like the patient
they admitted to the lab.

611
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,200
The boy, the subject named
Tetsuo Shima, broke out of his room.

612
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,100
I think he's headed for the Baby Room.

613
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,600
Tetsuo?!

614
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,100
He is an extremely dangerous state!
Don't let him through!

615
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,700
I repeat, do not let him through!

616
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,400
What the--?

617
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,800
It's no use hiding.

618
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,700
We have no choice, then.
Use your guns!

619
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,600
We can't let him go any farther,
no matter what it takes!

620
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,800
Fire!

621
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,700
So, here you are...

622
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,500
Stop it!

623
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,400
How long are you gonna
keep playing around?!

624
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,400
Where'd the other one go?

625
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,100
Why, you...

626
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,900
Die!

627
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,600
Takashi!

628
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:28,700
What the hell is going on?
Am I dreaming or something?

629
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,600
I never knew I had powers like this!

630
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,100
Damn it, which way should I go?!

631
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,900
Straight. Straight ahead...

632
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,200
Huh?

633
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,300
There's a freight elevator.

634
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,800
We can take it to sublevel 8.

635
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,000
Good, you're all together.

636
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,400
You thought you could kill me?

637
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,300
You tried to mess with me...
I'm gonna kill you!

638
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,400
That was you--

639
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,600
Takashi!

640
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,500
Attack him together!

641
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,800
O-Okay.

642
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,500
You little twerps!

643
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,500
That's enough!
All of you!

644
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,700
Who the hell are you?!

645
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,600
What's the matter? Does your
head hurt, Tetsuo Shima?

646
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,700
Your power isn't fully matured.

647
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,800
If you push yourself, you might
do irreparable damage.

648
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,900
just do as we tell you.

649
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:20,900
What the hell did you
people do to my head?!

650
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,600
Calm yourself, Tetsuo Shima!

651
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,300
He can't control it.

652
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,900
What?!

653
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,100
She said that big people like you
should never use the power like that.

654
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,400
She says something
horrible will happen.

655
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,900
Mind your own business.

656
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,300
What? More powerful than me?

657
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:02,800
He 's the one! He's been popping
in and out of my head lately!

658
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:07,100
- Where is he?! Where's this "Akira"?!
- What?!

659
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,700
Kiyoko said that
you'll awaken Akira.

660
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,100
If that happens, no one will
be able to stop him.

661
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,200
So before that can happen,
we have to stop you.

662
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,200
Impossible! Akira's already--

663
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,800
WH ERE IS H E?!

664
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,400
Stop it!

665
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,900
Shut up!

666
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,500
Threat level to facility
integrity has passed level 7..

667
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:37,600
Enacting disaster protocols.

668
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:42,300
Threat level to facility
integrity has passed level 7..

669
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,400
Enacting disaster protocols.

670
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:46,900
What the--?!

671
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,800
Hands up!

672
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,800
Where the hell is the " Baby Room"?!

673
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,700
Oh, no! Run!

674
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,100
Gangway, coming through!
Coming through!

675
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,900
Damn it, move!

676
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,100
Kiyoko...

677
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,800
Damn, that hurt...

678
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:52,100
Kaneda? What're you doing here?

679
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,300
Tetsuo! Are you okay?
I'm here to rescue you!

680
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:04,500
Hurry up, you moron! If we don't get out
of here, those guys outside are gonna--

681
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,800
There he is! Catch him!

682
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,400
Stay away from me!

683
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:18,800
Kaneda!

684
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,700
Oh, right. I forgot you
were there, Kaneda.

685
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,700
That's okay, Kaneda.

686
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,400
I won't be needing you
to save me anymore.

687
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,100
From now on,
I'll be saving you.

688
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,400
All you have to do is ask, Kanny.

689
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:43,100
Say what? Who the hell do
you think you're talking to?!

690
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,000
You don't like the way I talk?

691
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,000
Does it make you mad?

692
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,500
Well, what're you
gonna do about it?!

693
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:54,200
Huh, Kaneda?! What're
you gonna do about it?!

694
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,600
That's enough!
Don't hurt anyone else!

695
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,700
Where's this "Akira" guy?!

696
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,900
He...

697
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,700
The Olympic stadium...?
I n an underground facility?

698
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
No! You're wrong! Akira is--

699
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,400
Wait!

700
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:39,500
What the hell?
I can do this, too?!

701
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,700
Kiyoko, are you okay?

702
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,800
It doesn't look like she's hurt.

703
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,500
What about you, Masaru?
You're bleeding.

704
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,100
What happened to him?

705
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,000
He flew away.

706
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,000
How can he have so much power...?

707
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
How could this have happened?
Is anyone here?

708
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,100
He's developed so much
power in such a short time...

709
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,400
Find him! Find Tetsuo!

710
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,300
- Find him! Go after him!
- Kaneda! Hang on, Kaneda!

711
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,900
Hurry up!
Get that rubble cleared!

712
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,100
He went to where Akira is.

713
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,900
What?
You're all safe!

714
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:28,900
He's heading for the facility below
the Olympic construction site.

715
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,500
How did Tetsuo find out about that?!

716
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,700
You mean he's gone outside?

717
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:44,100
Damn it! We'll follow him!
Prepare for pursuit!

718
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,500
- Yes sir!
- He's heading west!

719
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,300
He's heading for the
Olympic construction site!

720
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,400
Tell them to beef up their security!

721
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,200
- You...!
- Set up checkpoints on all...

722
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:03,500
According to the defense team, intruders
were encountered in the wiring shaft.

723
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,000
Two disguised as workers resisted
and were shot, and the rest are at large.

724
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,800
He has to be stopped
before his powers mature...

725
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,600
Your objective is the boy Tetsuo Shima.

726
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,200
If we are unable to capture him, you will
lure him out to the old city and attack.

727
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,500
Request assistance from the
Eastern District Battalion.

728
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,300
- Yes sir!
- Tell them there isn't a moment to lose!

729
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,900
I've been waiting for you, Colonel.

730
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,500
Who the hell are you?!

731
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:35,400
I'm here to inform you of the supreme
executive council's decision.

732
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:42,100
At 2400 hours today, the Colonel is hereby
stripped of his command and rank,

733
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,300
and will be placed under arrest.

734
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,800
What?!

735
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,100
Please come with us.

736
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,000
You expect me to hand Neo Tokyo
over to those fools at a time like this?

737
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,600
- Shoot him.
- Yes sir!

738
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:58,900
What?

739
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,100
W-Wait!

740
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:06,700
Enough! Open your eyes and
look at the big picture!

741
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,300
We can't dance to the tune of
corrupt politicians and capitalists!

742
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:17,200
Don't you understand?!
It's pointless to fight anymore!

743
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,900
Announce a state of emergency, arrest
all members of the executive council...

744
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,200
...and remove them from
the chain of command!

745
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,800
We're going after Tetsuo!

746
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:34,600
Urgent message to all district
battalion commanders!

747
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:48,000
Hey, what's up?
You by yourself?

748
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:53,100
Weren't you in an
accident or something?

749
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,400
Everybody's been worried.
So, you feeling better?

750
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,000
Gimme some... capsules.

751
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:04,200
Hey, are you sure about that?
You don't look so hot.

752
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,000
just hand 'em over!

753
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,200
All right, if you say so.

754
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,000
But with all those demonstrations and
terrorist attacks lately, things are rough.

755
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,800
They're hard to come by,
so they're pretty expensive.

756
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:28,700
Tetsuo's run off, Kaneda's disappeared...
I guess the team's fiinished.

757
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:34,000
And the checkpoints are so strict,
even the Clowns are staying put.

758
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,100
What's wrong?

759
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:49,800
He's dead!

760
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
What?!

761
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:54,500
What the--?

762
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,400
Tetsuo?

763
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:05,200
What are you doing here?

764
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,800
You want some, too?

765
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,700
What are you talking about, damn it?!
What the hell happened here?!

766
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,600
The barkeep's dead!

767
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,100
A fish out of water dies, huh?

768
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,800
You are Tetsuo... Aren't you?

769
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,800
Kaneda sends his regards.

770
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,100
You saw Kaneda?!

771
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,000
He's probably dead by now...

772
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,600
You did this, Tetsuo?

773
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,000
So anyway... Where's Kaneda's bike?

774
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,400
Tetsuo!

775
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,800
I don't need a piece of junk
like that anymore...

776
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,200
You son of a...

777
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Yamagata!

778
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,700
Shit...

779
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,300
He went to where Akira is?

780
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,100
That's what that girl said.

781
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:21,800
The army, you, and Ryu are all
looking for this "Akira" guy,

782
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,200
so that's why you're
chasing after Tetsuo.

783
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,800
It has something to do with
that power of Tetsuo's, right?

784
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,800
What the hell is this "Akira"
thing you keep talking about?

785
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:38,200
Ryu told me about it once.
He said that Akira is absolute energy.

786
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,500
Absolute energy?

787
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:44,800
Humans do all kinds of things
during their lifetime, right?

788
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:49,000
Discovering things, building things...

789
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:56,200
Things like houses, motorcycles,
bridges, cities, and rockets...

790
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:00,500
All that knowledge and energy...
Where do you suppose it comes from?

791
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,900
Humans were like monkeys once, right?

792
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:09,100
And before that, like reptiles and fish.

793
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:14,100
And before that, plankton and amoebas.

794
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,200
Even creatures like those have
incredible energy inside them.

795
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,800
Because of genes, I guess.

796
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:26,400
And even before that, maybe there
were genes in the water and air.

797
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,300
Even in space dust, too, I bet.

798
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,600
If that's true, what
memories are hidden in it?

799
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,100
The beginning of the universe, maybe.
Or maybe even before that.

800
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,900
Hey, what's the matter?
Are you okay?

801
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,700
Did you get hit on
the head back there?

802
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,900
Maybe everyone has those memories.

803
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,200
What if there were some mistake
and the progression went wrong,

804
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:55,800
and something like an amoeba
were given power like a human's?

805
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,600
That's what Akira is?

806
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,000
Amoebas don't build
houses and bridges.

807
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,400
They just devour all
the food around them.

808
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:10,600
That's what Tetsuo's doing?
You're saying he has that kind of energy?!

809
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,700
A long time ago, there were people
who tried to control that power.

810
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,300
At the government's request, you see.

811
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:22,700
They failed, and it
triggered the Fall of Tokyo.

812
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:27,500
That power is still too much for--

813
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,200
What?!

814
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,400
The door's unlocked.

815
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:38,000
Huh?

816
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,700
This has got to be a trap.

817
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,400
Go back, then.

818
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,800
No, we ought to find out
how much of it is a trap...

819
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,400
By the way, what's with
you and that Ryu guy?

820
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,600
- What do you mean?
- You're always together.

821
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,600
That's none of your business!

822
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:07,200
What I'm saying is, he doesn't
know about us, does he?

823
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,400
"Us"?

824
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,900
Hey, wait a minute!
What's that supposed to mean?

825
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,300
Do you think this will work?

826
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:20,300
It can't be helped. At this point,
our only option is to use her.

827
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:27,200
The fact that she turned up right under
our noses says as much, I think.

828
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:28,900
I guess...

829
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,300
Have arrived at Ward 13,
East Ginza intersection. Over.

830
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,700
Northern District battalion has not
responded to mobilization request.

831
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:53,100
Special search team to HQ!
Special search team to HQ!

832
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,500
We 're at the Haruki-ya snack barnear
the highway interchange in Ward 8.

833
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:02,700
It doesn't look like a bomb explosion,
so we think it was him.

834
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,800
It was almost certainly the work of the
subject that escaped from the lab.

835
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,800
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
Understood!

836
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,100
Kaneda!

837
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,700
What?! Yamagata's dead?!

838
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,500
Something seemed strange about
him from the second I saw him.

839
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:27,200
He was wearing what looked
like a white hospital gown.

840
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,800
It was like he was
a different person.

841
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:34,800
Yamagata asked him if
he was really Tetsuo.

842
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:39,500
And then... Yamagata, he...

843
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,100
We've always been together.

844
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:51,200
I've known everything about him
since we were in the children's home.

845
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:55,600
He was a klutz, and
everybody made him cry.

846
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:00,700
Oh, right... He wanted to
know where your bike was.

847
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:03,100
My bike...?

848
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,100
What're you gonna do?

849
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,700
I'm gonna send Yamagata his bike.

850
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,700
You dumb bastard!

851
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,100
Kaneda!

852
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,500
Kei!

853
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,600
What's wrong?

854
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,600
You! You were there that night...

855
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,300
Wait!

856
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,600
Kei!

857
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,900
They disappeared!

858
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,500
You were the ones who changed
Tetsuo too, weren't you?

859
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:21,100
Akira's power exists within everyone.

860
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:23,300
Who's there?!

861
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:30,400
But when that power is awakened,
you must choose how to use it,

862
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,800
even if you weren't prepared for it.

863
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
And he has made his choice.

864
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:44,900
Tetsuo is our newest companion.

865
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,600
We're partly to blame for his actions.

866
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,500
Why did you take Kei, then?!

867
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,700
We want her to help us.

868
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:59,800
You can't just use people like that!
Bring Kei back!

869
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:04,200
Tetsuo's our friend! If anyone's
gonna kill him, it should be us!

870
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,200
Hey!

871
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,600
Damn it!

872
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,700
Mr. Omi and the other executives
have been arrested by the coup...?

873
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,500
Y-Yes, that's right.

874
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,700
The house guards are
fighting them right now.

875
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:20,300
Yes.

876
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,700
I'd like to have a helicopter
waiting at West Haneda.

877
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,500
Yes.

878
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:28,300
That damned Colonel...
I can't believe he's taken up arms.

879
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,000
I underestimated him.

880
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,500
Hold them here! Damn!

881
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,700
Mr. Nezu...

882
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,400
R-Ryu?! Is that you?

883
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,200
I'm sorry, sir...

884
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,800
The mission was a failure.

885
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:21,400
What are you doing here?!

886
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,000
I've told you, you can't be seen here!

887
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,100
All of my men...

888
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,400
They've all been killed.

889
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,900
Y-You sold me out,
didn't you, you bastard?!

890
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:34,200
What? You can't be--

891
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,900
Kei...

892
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,300
I got fresh fish in here, buddy!
I'm gonna get compensated for 'em, right?

893
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,700
Please, I have to catch a flight at noon!

894
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,500
What?

895
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:55,800
7th Avenue is just ahead!

896
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,100
It intersects this road
100 meters from here!

897
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,100
Prepare for battle!

898
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,300
Right, we've spotted the subject.

899
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,100
What? Attack?!

900
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,600
But he's just a...
We're attacking a boy?!

901
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,900
- Look! There he is!
- Impossible!

902
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,300
Is this for real?

903
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,000
Firing preparations complete.

904
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,700
Damn it! Fire!

905
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,000
- Akira!
- It's Lord Akira!

906
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,000
It's the advent of Lord Akira!

907
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,600
That's not him!
Don't be fooled!

908
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
That's not Lord Akira!

909
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,300
Shut up!

910
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,100
Long live Lord Akira!

911
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:16,600
Fire!

912
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,900
Huh?

913
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:20,100
What's wrong?

914
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:50,500
Neo Tokyo Broadcasting is
exclusively covering the news...

915
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:53,100
...in spite of martial law in the
name of freedom of the press!

916
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:57,400
What in the world is happening
here in Neo Tokyo?

917
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:00,300
What you see here seems to be
fires caused by tank cannons.

918
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:03,600
But who is this young boy?

919
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:06,500
Is he fighting the coup
forces all by himself?

920
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:12,700
Viewers, the army has just
illegall ordered us to land!

921
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,500
Freedom of thepress
is now in jeopardy!

922
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,000
What happened?
Were they cut off?

923
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,100
The bridge! He's heading
for the bridge!

924
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,300
Let's go see!

925
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,900
Are you really going alone?

926
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:45,200
He wants this, doesn't he?

927
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,000
We should call the gang together.

928
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Hey!

929
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,300
I wouldn't want to keep him waiting.

930
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,800
Hey, Kaneda! Wait!

931
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,100
Half seem to be
anti-government demonstrators.

932
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:10,500
The rest are... Well, they're more
like some crazy cult than onlookers.

933
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:13,400
They're following after the subject,
and more and more keep coming.

934
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:20,600
Oh, flames of purity,

935
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:24,000
raze this corrupt city!

936
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,900
Consume our unclean hearts!

937
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:32,200
Fear not!

938
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:37,000
Your bodies will be
purifiied in the flames!

939
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,700
Ready!

940
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,100
Fire!

941
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,600
Set the switch to hold for three
seconds and converge your beams!

942
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Aim!

943
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,000
Fire!

944
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:02,900
Watch this!

945
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,600
Look out!
Let's get out of here!

946
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,500
Help me!

947
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:32,200
Ground forces!
Ground forces, come in!

948
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,700
Report! What is the subject's status?!

949
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,100
Ground forces!

950
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,700
Call the Doctor.

951
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:43,100
We have confirmation of his recent
movements and are in pursuit.

952
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:45,500
His present position is... Let's see...

953
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:50,300
Coordinates 99871 by 4332.

954
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,800
That's about2 km south of the Olympics
construction site in the old city.

955
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:55,800
What?!

956
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:02,800
What was that?

957
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,700
Look!

958
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,900
That's near the toll booth that's
being guarded by the 2nd platoon.

959
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:10,300
Wha--?

960
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:12,900
Huh?

961
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:19,600
Please turn around!
This area's off limits to civilians!

962
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:21,800
What? That's the subject?!

963
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,600
S-Stop!

964
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,000
Stop, damn it!

965
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:33,000
Nice place you have here.

966
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:43,500
Wait, you were with Kaneda.

967
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,700
You shouldn't use your power this way.

968
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,400
What?

969
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:53,800
I n the end, you won't
be able to control it.

970
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,400
The kids...

971
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,200
You're those brats, aren't you?!

972
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,400
Okay, then...!

973
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,600
What the--?

974
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:53,300
It's not safe here, Colonel!

975
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,900
Well, what're you gonna do?

976
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Open up!

977
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:17,900
What the hell?

978
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:21,000
That's Akira, Tetsuo!

979
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:24,500
That's the "Akira"
you wanted to meet.

980
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:27,200
There's your Messiah!

981
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:29,900
After his transcendental awakening,

982
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:34,500
his body was subjected to
every test known to science.

983
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:38,800
And that's what was left of it.

984
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:51,800
The scientists back then were
unable to solve the mystery,

985
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:56,600
so they decided to entrust their
collected data and test samples...

986
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,000
...to future generations by
preserving them in a frozen capsule.

987
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,900
SOL... We'll use SOL!

988
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:04,900
Sir?

989
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,400
Akira is already dead!

990
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:12,900
Well? Are you satisfied now, Tetsuo?

991
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:20,300
So come back with us!

992
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,700
Like hell!

993
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,800
Contact the central defense center...

994
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,500
...and tell them to patch us
through to SOL's control circuits!

995
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:30,000
Yes sir!

996
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:47,700
Hey, watch it!

997
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:51,500
Damn it, move!
Get out of the way!

998
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,800
What is this, science class?

999
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,700
What's wrong?
Have some trouble?

1000
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:34,100
Yeah, but I already took care of it.

1001
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,900
If you were here earlier,
you could've watched the show.

1002
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:39,100
You had me worried again.

1003
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:42,900
I figured you'd be standing here,
sobbing like a little baby.

1004
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:46,800
Kaneda, you've always
been a pain in the ass.

1005
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:51,900
You've been telling me what
to do ever since we were kids.

1006
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:54,500
You always treat me like a kid.

1007
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,200
You always show up and
start bossing me around!

1008
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:59,800
And now you're a boss, too...

1009
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,800
Of this pile of rubble.

1010
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:03,000
Kaneda!

1011
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,600
That's Mister Kaneda to you, punk!

1012
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,300
Die!

1013
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:19,000
Tetsuo!

1014
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,100
Son of a...

1015
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,100
Kei!

1016
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:02,100
Oh, hell!

1017
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:08,000
Let's do it!

1018
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:20,900
Got him!

1019
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:23,400
Huh?

1020
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:29,300
The battery?!

1021
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:31,600
What's the matter, Kaneda?

1022
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,600
God damn it!
This ain't fair, Tetsuo!

1023
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,300
Fight with your bare hands!

1024
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,100
Oh, this is funny...

1025
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,300
Feeling frustrated, Kaneda?

1026
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:49,400
Now do you understand how it feels?

1027
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:57,800
What's this light?

1028
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:09,700
Well, did you hit him?

1029
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:12,700
We're too close to the impact point.
There's too much electrical interference.

1030
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,400
Prepare a second volley!

1031
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:41,800
Hey! Kaneda!

1032
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,700
Tetsuo!

1033
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,500
Shit...

1034
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:21,500
Huh?

1035
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,800
What the--?

1036
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:00,300
Correcting for tracking system error.

1037
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:01,900
T-minus-20 to energy alteration.

1038
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,000
- Fire extinguishers!
- Are you okay?

1039
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:04,600
Hurry! Hurry!

1040
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
What happened?
What's going on?

1041
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:17,900
Kaneda!

1042
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:21,000
Kai! Kei!

1043
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:22,200
- Kaneda!
- Kaneda!

1044
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:24,700
- Get on!
- Get on? Where?

1045
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:25,900
Hurry! Hurry!

1046
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:49,700
What's that?

1047
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:06,000
They say it's SOL.

1048
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:18,300
Magnificent...

1049
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:32,000
When Tetsuo's power reaches its peak?

1050
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:33,900
That's when we do it.

1051
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:36,900
But will it work?

1052
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:42,400
The future doesn't proceed
along a single course.

1053
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:46,500
There ought to be a
future we can choose.

1054
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,000
What's Tetsuo's status?

1055
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:59,700
Ah. Colonel...

1056
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:03,200
We set up a camera in the
stadium a while ago.

1057
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,100
We have him under observation.

1058
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:10,500
Colonel, you must take
a look at this data!

1059
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:14,100
We're still analyzing the energy
given off by the subject, but...

1060
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:17,400
It's magnificent.
Absolutely magnificent.

1061
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,900
This is clearly a proton collapse.

1062
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:24,000
We're also detecting a fair number of
what we believe to be unknown particles.

1063
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:27,200
If we can put this into a
theoretical framework, physics--

1064
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:28,800
No, science...

1065
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:31,900
Humanity itself could touch the
fundamental truths of the universe!

1066
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:35,600
Oh. That's...

1067
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,100
We still haven't finished
making our adjustments.

1068
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,400
Uh, Colonel!

1069
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:47,800
T-That's...!

1070
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:53,500
You bastard!
What did I tell you?!

1071
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:54,900
B-But, Colonel!

1072
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:58,100
I couldn't throw away such
a magnificent subject!

1073
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,400
Shut up!

1074
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,400
Shit! It's on fire!

1075
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:27,100
The battery! The battery!

1076
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:29,800
My bike! It's burning up!

1077
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:32,800
Hey, what's a bike or two?

1078
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,800
What? Then there's nothing wrong
with using yours, right?

1079
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:38,200
You heard that?

1080
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:39,400
Yeah, I did!

1081
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,100
Hey, your bike's still on fire.

1082
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,000
Tetsuo?

1083
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:40,400
Tetsuo, why does everyone
call you "Akira"?

1084
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:43,500
He never existed in the first place.

1085
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:47,200
They didn't care who it was.

1086
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,800
just so long as he destroyed things.

1087
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:53,900
Your arm!

1088
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:58,500
It doesn't look like much,
but it works pretty good.

1089
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:04,200
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1090
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:08,100
It's nothing!

1091
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:11,100
- Tetsuo...
- Shut up! Just go away!

1092
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:20,500
Medicine...

1093
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,100
What's wrong, Tetsuo?
Are you in pain?

1094
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,200
Go back to the lab and get
me some of that medicine!

1095
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,400
Did you hear that, Doctor?

1096
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:31,800
Yes, Colonel.

1097
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,700
Well? Can you see any signs of it?

1098
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,400
I'm not entirely certain,

1099
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:40,300
but it seems that the power that had been
held back by the drugs is breaking free.

1100
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:44,500
He may not be able to control power
that has awakened so suddenly.

1101
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,200
At any rate, he's in an
extremely dangerous condition!

1102
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:52,200
If you don't go back to the lab and
receive proper treatment, you may die.

1103
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:59,200
You want me to enroll in that
kindergarten and live happily ever after?

1104
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:04,900
Take my medicine every day
and shrivel up like those kids?!

1105
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:11,900
Kaori...

1106
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:13,600
Kaori...

1107
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:18,000
Please... I need that medicine...

1108
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:19,900
No...!

1109
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:21,900
Tetsuo!

1110
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:24,400
Tetsuo!

1111
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:27,900
Tetsuo--

1112
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:01,100
Kaneda?!

1113
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:40,600
Huh?

1114
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:49,800
Son of a...

1115
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:55,800
You kids... What are you doing here?

1116
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:03,800
You never learn, do you?

1117
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:07,400
Tetsuo!

1118
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:23,800
Takashi...

1119
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:27,800
Akira...

1120
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:44,600
Kaneda...? H-Help me...!

1121
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:55,800
Kaori...

1122
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:01,600
Help me...!

1123
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,100
Help me!

1124
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,000
Stop it!

1125
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:36,600
Kaori?
Kaori!

1126
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,300
Kaori!

1127
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:40,800
Tetsuo? Is that you, Tetsuo?!

1128
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:44,100
Kaori! Kaori's gonna die!

1129
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,700
What?! What did you say?!

1130
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:49,500
My body's not doing what I tell it to!

1131
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:51,800
My power's acting on its own...!

1132
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:54,300
Kaori!

1133
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:56,800
Kaori's dying!

1134
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:59,400
Kaneda, help me!

1135
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:01,100
Stop, Tetsuo!

1136
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,100
Stop it!

1137
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:07,300
Kaori's pain is coming into me...!

1138
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:11,700
Tetsuo!

1139
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,800
Kaneda! Run away!

1140
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:31,000
Tetsuo!

1141
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:46,000
Kiyoko! Takashi! Masaru!
Get away from here!

1142
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,100
Come on!

1143
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:00,800
I can't believe it. It's as if--

1144
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,700
Kiyoko! Taka--

1145
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:55,100
Hi, Akira.

1146
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:05,600
Th-This is...

1147
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:09,400
But that's-- Oh, no!

1148
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:20,000
W-Where am I?

1149
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:23,300
Hurry! Get into the tunnel!

1150
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:25,200
You'll be safe in there.

1151
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:26,800
Kiyoko! Where are you?

1152
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:43,500
Tetsuo!

1153
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Kaneda!

1154
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:47,400
Hang on!

1155
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,200
If you don't get out of
here now, you'll--

1156
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:52,300
Out of the way!

1157
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:54,000
Tetsuo!

1158
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:55,200
Don't go!

1159
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:04,400
No, Takashi!

1160
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:08,100
If you went in now,
you'd be trapped, too.

1161
01:51:08,700 --> 01:51:11,800
But none of this is his fault!

1162
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:20,600
Takashi!

1163
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,000
Takashi!

1164
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:34,700
If we went in, we wouldn't be
strong enough to come back out.

1165
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:39,800
But if the three of us worked together,
maybe we could at least save that boy.

1166
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:41,600
You're right.

1167
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:43,500
Together, the three of us could...

1168
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,100
Oh, man...!

1169
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:57,100
We should get out of here. Hey!

1170
01:51:58,500 --> 01:51:59,800
Kaneda...

1171
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:36,100
Look, you're not revving
your engine enough.

1172
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:39,600
When you go into a corner, lean like
you're trying to kill yourself. Watch!

1173
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:41,900
What're you doing?

1174
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,700
Cornering, man.

1175
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:47,200
Got it, Tetsuo...?

1176
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:55,000
Look, there's another one!

1177
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:57,400
- Another transfer student?
- He was abandoned.

1178
01:52:57,700 --> 01:52:59,300
You can see it in his face.

1179
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:08,000
Are... Are these your dreams, Tetsuo?

1180
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:10,800
Wait!

1181
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:31,200
This is Akira...?

1182
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:34,400
Yes. We called him.

1183
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:37,200
To have him take Tetsuo away.

1184
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:40,300
Take him away?
Take him where?

1185
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:42,800
It's too much for Tetsuo.

1186
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:45,600
And for us. And for Akira.

1187
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:49,800
It's too big for us as we are now.

1188
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:53,300
But someday, we 'll
also be able to...

1189
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:57,000
You see, it's already begun.

1190
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:59,700
Your friend's--

1191
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:01,300
My friend?

1192
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:05,400
Kei! You mean Kei, don't you?

1193
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:32,600
Tetsuo...

1194
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:39,300
This is yours, right?

1195
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:49,300
They're always like that with the new kids.
You came today, right?

1196
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,200
They beat me up, too.

1197
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:54,000
But the truth is,
those guys are wimps.

1198
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I'm Tetsuo. Tetsuo Shima.

1199
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:03,800
To tell you the truth,
I just got here myself.

1200
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:05,200
I'm--

1201
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,300
Kaneda...

1202
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:09,700
Kaneda?

1203
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,800
- Kaneda!
- Kei?

1204
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,600
W-What's happening?
What in the world is happening?

1205
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:46,600
B-But this isn't...

1206
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:51,200
If this is correct, it's almost as if...
Is this the birth of a universe?!

1207
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,800
Kei!

1208
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:08,100
What happened?

1209
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:12,800
It's disappearing...!
It's disappearing!

1210
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:26,600
Kaneda!

1211
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,200
Tetsuo...

1212
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:55,200
Kaneda...

1213
01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:58,400
Thanks.

1214
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:02,600
You called to me, right?
I heard you.

1215
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:12,400
Kaneda, don't tell me you're...

1216
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:14,600
What about Tetsuo?

1217
01:59:15,700 --> 01:59:17,100
He left.

1218
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:20,000
So did those three kids.

1219
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:21,800
Akira, too.

1220
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,300
Kaneda, back then, you...

1221
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:30,200
Kaneda! You're alive?!

1222
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:35,900
I thought you were
in there for sure!

1223
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:39,300
Tetsuo...

1224
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:40,900
What happened to Tetsuo?

1225
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:42,700
Is he dead?!

1226
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,000
I'm not so sure.
But he's probably...

1227
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:14,900
But someday, we 'll
also be able to...
