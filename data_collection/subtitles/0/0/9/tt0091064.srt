26
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,517
What am I working on?

27
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:09,061
Uh, I'm working on something that'll change the word...

28
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:11,296
...and human life as we know it.

29
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:13,206
Change it a lot or just a bit?

30
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:15,157
You'll have to be more specific.

31
00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:18,668
What, do you want me to be specific here, in this room...

32
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:22,705
...with, uh, half the scientific community of North America eavesdropping?

33
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:24,805
Is there another way?

34
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:27,966
Uh, y-you could come back to my lab.

35
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:30,977
Listen, I'II make you cappuccino.

36
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:32,628
I have a Faema of my very own.

37
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:33,803
You know what that is?

38
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:36,213
It's not the dilettante's plastic kitchen model.

39
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:38,716
It's one of those, uh, real restaurant espresso machines...

40
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:40,717
...with the eagle on top and--

41
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:44,753
Somehow I get the feeling you don't get out much.

42
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:46,853
You can tell that?

43
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:48,880
Yeah.

44
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:59,063
I think you're making a mistake.

45
00:02:59,163 --> 00:03:01,266
I think you really want to talk to me.

46
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:04,368
Sorry. I have three other interviews to do before this party's over.

47
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:07,837
Yeah, but they're not working on something that'll change the word as we know it.

48
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,937
They say they are.

49
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:13,407
Yeah, but they're lying.
I'm not.

50
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:22,405
Are you sick?
- Oh--

51
00:03:22,513 --> 00:03:24,708
Sure.

52
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:27,960
You're not a very accomplished drunk.

53
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:30,160
No, no. I'm always like this.

54
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:32,112
It's, uh, motion sickness.

55
00:03:32,187 --> 00:03:34,348
When I was a kid, I, uh...

56
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:36,495
...puked on my tricycle.

57
00:03:37,658 --> 00:03:38,692
I hate vehicles.

58
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,786
- Should I drive more showily?

59
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:42,727
No, no.
Just turn left.

60
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:44,456
We're almost there.

61
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,400
This is it?

62
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,207
It's, uh, cleaner on the inside.

63
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:17,752
Please.

64
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:47,741
####

65
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:50,903
Listen, uh, maybe this is a bad idea.

66
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:54,045
No. It's too late.

67
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:55,948
You've already seen them.

68
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:58,551
Can't let you leave here alive.

69
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:02,109
####
- I haven't seen anything.

70
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:05,088
Those.

71
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:07,850
####

72
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:12,885
Designer phone booths.

73
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:15,257
Very cute.

74
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:19,131
Hey, I bet you have a really neat jukebox in here too someplace.

75
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,894
Over there maybe?
- No.

76
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:27,137
No, this is the--

77
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:30,674
This is the prototype of... those.

78
00:05:30,774 --> 00:05:33,209
It's the first one I had made.

79
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:36,904
It, uh, works, but it's clunky.

80
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:51,149
I call them telecoms.

81
00:05:52,456 --> 00:05:54,751
They're controlled by this.

82
00:05:54,758 --> 00:05:57,089
Thank God for that.

83
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:01,489
So what do they do, the phone booths?

84
00:06:01,596 --> 00:06:04,622
Telepods.

85
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,731
Oh.

86
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:11,327
Uh, okay. I need an object. Um--

87
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:16,173
Say, do you have something on you that's...

88
00:06:16,273 --> 00:06:18,307
...uh, personal that I could use?

89
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:21,843
Something uniquely you, an item of clothing or jewellery?

90
00:06:21,943 --> 00:06:23,943
What, are you kidding?

91
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:25,945
No, I'm serious.

92
00:06:29,283 --> 00:06:31,877
Okay.
Here it goes.

93
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:48,256
Mm-hmm.

94
00:06:49,563 --> 00:06:51,588
I don't wear jewellery.

95
00:06:51,698 --> 00:06:54,030
Mm-hmm.

96
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:02,365
It's nice.

97
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:17,049
Uh, Brundle, Seth.

98
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:22,352
Uh, Bundle, Seth.

99
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:24,584
Uh, Bundle, Seth.

100
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:26,689
Uh, Bundle, Seth.

101
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:33,830
Begin teleportation sequence.

102
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,221
Um, keep your eye on the stocking.

103
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,688
Well?

104
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,788
Great.

105
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:13,759
The words largest microwave oven.

106
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:17,294
I'm glad I didn't give you my Rolex, if I had a Rolex.

107
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:20,369
No, you're missing the point. Look.

108
00:08:27,335 --> 00:08:29,335
'Teleportation'?

109
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:32,870
Please.

110
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:48,314
Oh--

111
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,611
Wait a minute.

112
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:52,718
Is that a hologram?

113
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,360
Where's my stocking?

114
00:08:54,386 --> 00:08:56,681
- That's it, the real one.

115
00:08:56,756 --> 00:08:58,756
Go ahead.
Pick it up.

116
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,994
I don't think I get it.

117
00:09:14,102 --> 00:09:14,966
What happened?

118
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:16,596
- You got it, all right.

119
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:19,663
You just can't handle it. Um--

120
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:23,868
Your stocking has just been teleported...

121
00:09:23,975 --> 00:09:26,808
...from one pod to another...

122
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:30,747
...uh, disintegrated there and reintegrated there.

123
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:32,847
Sort of.

124
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:36,674
It will change the word as we know it, right?

125
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,287
Oh, no--

126
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:46,752
Uh, this is, uh-- This is incredible.

127
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:48,760
I mean, it's not possible, is it?

128
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,863
How have you managed to keep this quiet?

129
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:53,086
Please sit down.

130
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:55,357
- How could you do this alone?

131
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:56,738
Well, I don't work alone.

132
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:59,794
There's a lot of stuff in there I don't even understand.

133
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:01,770
I'm really, uh, a systems management man.

134
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,106
I farm bits and pieces out to guys who are much more brilliant than I am.

135
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,483
I say, 'Build me a laser this.

136
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:09,167
Design me a molecuIar analyser that.'

137
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,244
They do. And I just stick them together.

138
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,612
But none of them knows what the project really is.

139
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:15,941
So--

140
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:18,981
Wow. And, uh, the money?

141
00:10:19,082 --> 00:10:21,116
Bartok Science Industries financed this?

142
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:25,019
Mm-hmm. But they leave me alone 'cause I'm not expensive.

143
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:28,322
And they know they'll end up owning it all, whatever it is. So--...

144
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:29,800
You haven't told them?

145
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:31,016
- When I'm ready.

146
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:33,252
Oh. Wait a second.

147
00:10:35,627 --> 00:10:36,627
What are you doing?

148
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:38,283
- Well, you want me to get...

149
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:39,897
...the quotes right, don't you?

150
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:42,192
Quotes? No, no.

151
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:44,315
I thought this was personal.

152
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:46,427
You can't write about this.

153
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:47,871
What are you taking about?

154
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,896
I'm a journalist.

155
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:50,873
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

156
00:10:50,973 --> 00:10:53,134
You knew that.
- Uh--

157
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,281
I'm sorry. I apologize.

158
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:55,166
I made a mistake.

159
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:56,950
I shouldnt have shown you this.

160
00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:58,203
I'm very, very sorry.

161
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:01,847
Listen. Particle magazine sent me to that party to get a story.

162
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:04,725
And this is the most exciting thing I've ever seen.

163
00:11:04,825 --> 00:11:06,050
No, no. AbsoluteIy not.

164
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,218
I'm gonna have to ask you for that tape.
Please.

165
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:09,318
You can't do that.

166
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,636
Don't you dare write a story.

167
00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:13,013
I'd never have told any of this stuff to a journalist.

168
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:15,447
But you did tell this stuff to a journalist.

169
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:16,782
- Yeah, I suppose I did.

170
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:20,059
Sure did.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

171
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,087
Wait-- Come here.

172
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,586
What about your stocking?

173
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:25,528
Keep it for good luck.

174
00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:33,003
I farm bits and pieces out...

175
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:35,337
...to guys who are much more brilliant than I am.

176
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:36,757
I say, 'Build me a laser this.

177
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:38,498
Design me a molecular analyser that.'

178
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,575
They do. End I just stick them together.

179
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:44,912
But none of them knows what the project really is. So--

180
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:46,913
Wow. End, uh, the money?

181
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:49,415
Bartok Science Industries financed this?

182
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:52,684
Mm-hmm. But they leave me alone 'cause I'm not expensive.

183
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:56,754
End they know they'll end up owning it all, whatever it is. So--

184
00:11:56,854 --> 00:11:59,287
Well, that's it.

185
00:11:59,388 --> 00:12:01,686
What do you think?

186
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:03,591
It's a joke.

187
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:06,251
What?
- He's conning you.

188
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:09,128
It's an old nightclub routine, the two cabinets.

189
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,355
End you fell for it.
- ...

190
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:13,344
Wait a minute.
That was no nightclub--

191
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,557
- Are we having lunch?

192
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:17,758
Listen, that was no nightclub routine.

193
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:19,757
I was there. I saw it.

194
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:22,362
Yep.

195
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,609
Sure.
Send him in.

196
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:31,446
You must have made an impression.

197
00:12:31,472 --> 00:12:32,937
- What do you mean?

198
00:12:33,012 --> 00:12:35,987
Your magician has folioed you here.

199
00:12:39,117 --> 00:12:39,984
I'm Stathis Borans.

200
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,744
I'm the editor of Particle magazine.

201
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:42,981
Uh, Seth Bundle--

202
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:44,579
- I know who you are.

203
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:46,180
Listen, uh, why don't

204
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:47,949
you two use my office?

205
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:50,023
I've gotta run.

206
00:12:50,091 --> 00:12:51,993
If you plan to make anything disappear...

207
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:54,093
...please let me know.

208
00:12:54,094 --> 00:12:59,024
I've got an assistant editor who's outlived his usefulness.

209
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:03,568
You didn't waste any time.

210
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:06,466
I'm not getting any younger.

211
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:10,094
He didn't seem-- He wasn't

212
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,199
impressed by your tape?

213
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:14,334
He thinks you're a con man.

214
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,610
Excellent.

215
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:21,948
Yeah? Well, let's see what the people at Omni think about it.

216
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:24,243
No, no, listen,
Veronica.

217
00:13:26,218 --> 00:13:28,786
I've come here to say one magic word to you.

218
00:13:28,886 --> 00:13:30,979
Yeah?

219
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:33,089
Cheeseburger.

220
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:41,331
I've been working alone too long.

221
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:45,698
I have a strong urge, uh, to talk about what I'm doing.

222
00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:49,757
But, um, if this gets out now--

223
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:52,200
Veronica,
it'll kill me.

224
00:13:52,303 --> 00:13:53,801
The Bartok people will kill me.

225
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:55,130
My coinages will kill me.

226
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:57,435
See, it's not ready yet.

227
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,830
Seems to work okay.

228
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:01,502
- No. Something import ants missing.

229
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:04,045
Yeah?

230
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,145
Yeah.

231
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,547
Which is?

232
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,280
I can only teleport inanimate objects.

233
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,989
Well, what happens when you try to teleport living things?

234
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:21,819
Not while we're eating.

235
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:24,450
It can't be worse than this.

236
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:30,164
Listen, you're not doing a very good job of convincing me.

237
00:14:30,264 --> 00:14:32,266
I think the word should know about it now...

238
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:34,666
...and I think I should be the one to tell it.

239
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:36,825
You should tell it...

240
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:39,335
...but, uh, not yet.

241
00:14:39,437 --> 00:14:41,471
Look, what do you got so far?

242
00:14:41,571 --> 00:14:43,407
Enough to make you nervous.

243
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,499
Why not get more?

244
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:46,567
Let me become your major project.

245
00:14:46,642 --> 00:14:48,844
I'm taking about a book, not a magazine article.

246
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:51,179
Follow me and my work day by day...

247
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,313
...in as much detail as you can stand.

248
00:14:53,413 --> 00:14:58,317
I don't have a life so there's nothing for you to interfere with.

249
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,415
Research the background.

250
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,105
Cover the process.

251
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:06,357
'The compete record of the most earth-shattering invention ever...

252
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:09,893
'the one that ended all concepts of transport...

253
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:13,988
...of borders and frontiers, of time and space.'

254
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,924
Your book will end with me transporting myself...

255
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:22,302
...15 feet through space from one telepod to another.

256
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:24,866
That's what's really missing.

257
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:28,638
Wait for me that long?

258
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:18,476
What are you doing in my apartment?

259
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:20,477
Just happened to be in the neighbourhood.

260
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:25,014
Felt a bit scummy.
Rough day.

261
00:16:30,184 --> 00:16:32,709
Aaah. Aaah. Oh.

262
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:37,654
How did you get in?

263
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:40,216
Have a key, remember?

264
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:42,325
You gave it to me.

265
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:45,229
I knew I should have changed the lock.

266
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:47,957
I knew you wouldnt.
- Yeah?

267
00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:50,555
Yeah.

268
00:16:50,665 --> 00:16:54,157
That's because, unconsciously...

269
00:16:55,236 --> 00:16:57,605
...you still want me to come back...

270
00:16:57,705 --> 00:16:59,705
...move in again.

271
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:03,436
No. That's because, very consciously...

272
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,752
I'm lazy and disorganized.

273
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,315
Your new playmates an interesting guy.

274
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:14,969
What playmates?

275
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:17,274
- The nightclub act.

276
00:17:18,785 --> 00:17:21,083
Bundle.

277
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:23,748
Yeah?
- Yeah.

278
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:26,590
Yeah, I was wrong.

279
00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:29,059
He's really quite brilliant.

280
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:32,463
He was the leader of the F-3-2 team.

281
00:17:32,563 --> 00:17:34,827
Remember that?

282
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:38,799
An inch away from the Nobel Prize for physics.

283
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,195
He was only 20 at the time.

284
00:17:41,202 --> 00:17:43,137
I don't even think I'm going to do Bundle.

285
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:45,438
I'm still considering the Psychology Today gig.

286
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:47,538
That's not like you.

287
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:51,641
Are you getting out or am I?

288
00:17:51,744 --> 00:17:53,744
I'II go.

289
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:57,814
I have to put this issue to bed. Want me
to come back later and tuck you in?

290
00:17:57,914 --> 00:18:00,404
No. Key.

291
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:03,449
I'II keep it...

292
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:05,451
...for old time's sake.

293
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:09,587
You're a petty schmuck.

294
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:33,630
Initiate in five seconds.

295
00:19:54,164 --> 00:19:56,100
I've got to do this, Seth.

296
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,098
Talk to the tape.

297
00:19:57,124 --> 00:19:58,126
Get in the habit.

298
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:00,303
The world will want to know what you're thinking.

299
00:20:00,403 --> 00:20:02,571
'Fuck' is what I'm thinking.

300
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:06,664
Good. The world will want to know that.

301
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:09,279
What else?

302
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:11,199
Why didn't it work?

303
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:15,102
I think it, uh, turned the baboon inside out.

304
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:20,047
Why?

305
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:21,284
Can't deal with the flesh.

306
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,445
It only seems to work with inanimate objects...

307
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,645
...nothing that's living.

308
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:28,747
Must be my fault.

309
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:31,991
Why?

310
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,034
Computers are dumb.

311
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,854
They only know what you tell them.

312
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:41,789
I must not know enough about the flesh myself.

313
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:44,184
I'm going to have to learn.

314
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:48,327
I don't want to talk now.

315
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:10,205
Do you ever change your clothes?

316
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:13,382
What?

317
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:14,553
Your clothes.

318
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:17,934
You're always wearing the same clothes.

319
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:21,761
No. These are clean.

320
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:24,312
I change my clothes every day.

321
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:35,838
Five sets of exactly the same clothes?

322
00:21:35,938 --> 00:21:38,668
Learned it from Einstein.

323
00:21:38,774 --> 00:21:40,542
This way I don't have to, um...

324
00:21:40,642 --> 00:21:42,877
...expend any thought on what I'm going to wear.

325
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:46,122
I just grab the next set on the rack.

326
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:53,649
I bought some steaks.

327
00:21:53,752 --> 00:21:55,752
Could I make you one?

328
00:21:55,753 --> 00:21:57,880
We could go out.

329
00:21:59,088 --> 00:22:01,386
Cheeseburger?

330
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:05,459
No, I-- I-- I--

331
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:07,671
We don't have to go there.

332
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,343
You're very cute.

333
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,852
You know that?

334
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:20,936
Am I?

335
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:01,300
Oh. Ow. Ow.
- What happened?

336
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,130
My back. Ow.

337
00:23:04,237 --> 00:23:05,100
Oh. Oh, God.

338
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:07,497
Something's stuck to your back.

339
00:23:07,572 --> 00:23:09,571
Well, pull it off.

340
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,566
Oh. Ooh.

341
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:16,303
Ow.

342
00:23:17,912 --> 00:23:19,971
Sorry.
- Oh.

343
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:23,150
Huh. I wondered what happened to this.

344
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,217
Do you have any disinfectant?

345
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:26,456
No, it's okay.

346
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:29,167
- Well, let me kiss it for you.

347
00:23:30,021 --> 00:23:34,151
Oh.
- Babe, thank you.

348
00:23:34,258 --> 00:23:36,749
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

349
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:40,488
Sorry.
I just want to eat you up.

350
00:23:42,163 --> 00:23:46,200
You know, that's why old ladies pinch babies' cheeks.

351
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,513
It's the flesh.

352
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:49,640
It just makes you crazy.

353
00:23:51,871 --> 00:23:53,896
Ronnie, Ronnie?
- Hmm?

354
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:00,674
Want to try an experiment?

355
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:02,776
Sure.

356
00:24:50,213 --> 00:24:52,212
Okay.

357
00:24:54,382 --> 00:24:57,612
Eat this. I need an objective opinion.

358
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:07,950
Yes?
- Well, it could use some finesse...

359
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:09,961
...but, um, it tastes like a steak.

360
00:25:10,061 --> 00:25:12,061
Oh.

361
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,763
Okay--

362
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,563
Now try this teleported half.

363
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:22,135
Are you serious?
A monkey just came apart in there.

364
00:25:22,235 --> 00:25:24,235
Baboon.
Eat.

365
00:25:27,907 --> 00:25:31,138
Ooh. Mm-- That tastes funny.

366
00:25:31,242 --> 00:25:32,118
Funny how?

367
00:25:32,144 --> 00:25:33,895
- It tastes, um...

368
00:25:33,978 --> 00:25:35,978
...synthetic.

369
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:38,839
Mm-hmm.

370
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:41,403
- So what have we proved?

371
00:25:42,484 --> 00:25:44,747
The computer is...

372
00:25:44,852 --> 00:25:48,507
...giving us its interpretation of a steak.

373
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:50,456
It's, uh, translating it for us.

374
00:25:50,556 --> 00:25:54,225
It's rethinking it rather than reproducing it...

375
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:57,461
...and something is getting lost in the translation.

376
00:25:57,561 --> 00:26:00,496
Me.
I'm lost.

377
00:26:00,597 --> 00:26:01,564
The flesh.

378
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,458
It should make the computer, uh, crazy...

379
00:26:06,534 --> 00:26:08,836
...like those old ladies pinching babies.

380
00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:09,985
But it doesn't. Not yet.

381
00:26:10,011 --> 00:26:11,497
I haven't taught the computer...

382
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:14,807
...to be made crazy by the, uh, flesh--...

383
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,075
...the poetry of the steak.

384
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:20,405
So I'm going to start teaching it now.

385
00:27:13,183 --> 00:27:16,152
####
-

386
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:29,859
I should have known it.

387
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:31,876
What are you doing here?

388
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:33,413
- I folioed you.

389
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:37,330
Psychology Today, my ass.

390
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:39,868
You stayed with Bundle all night.

391
00:27:39,968 --> 00:27:42,470
Why didn't I believe you, I wonder?

392
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,734
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

393
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,398
I think he'd look great in this.

394
00:27:46,473 --> 00:27:48,473
Don't you? Hmm?

395
00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:52,944
Hmm?
I mean, for your Time magazine cover...

396
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:54,946
...you've got to look good, right?

397
00:27:55,046 --> 00:27:56,198
Don't you get it?

398
00:27:56,224 --> 00:27:59,341
I'm finally onto something that's big.
Huge.

399
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:01,543
Yeah? What, his cock?

400
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:04,929
Crude, Stathis.
Very crude.

401
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:07,581
You're too perfect to believe.

402
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:09,953
You're a goddess.

403
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:12,893
Thank you for making my most paranoid fantasies come true.

404
00:28:12,993 --> 00:28:15,295
I don't have to report to you, you creep.

405
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:17,930
Ronnie, you've got to talk to me.

406
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,286
I don't have to do anything.

407
00:28:19,312 --> 00:28:20,523
We're finished, remember?

408
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:23,934
I'II spend the night anywhere I damn well please.

409
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:26,499
Sorry. Uh,
I'II take this too.

410
00:29:00,595 --> 00:29:03,315
I think it's time for champagne.

411
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:11,269
Oh, God, Seth.

412
00:29:11,295 --> 00:29:12,994
It's really happened.

413
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:16,171
You did it.
Youll never have to get carsick again.

414
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:18,271
Or airsick or seasick.

415
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:20,019
Mm, I know, I know.

416
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:21,790
Or tricycle-sick.

417
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:25,975
What's next?

418
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:29,014
Well, I'II send the baboon out for tests.

419
00:29:29,114 --> 00:29:30,084
See if he's really okay.

420
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,241
- How long will that take?

421
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:33,316
Could be weeks.

422
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:35,942
Really?

423
00:29:36,052 --> 00:29:37,267
Yeah, why?

424
00:29:37,293 --> 00:29:40,571
- Well, I was thinking...

425
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:42,958
...that we could take a holiday.

426
00:29:43,058 --> 00:29:44,058
We could?

427
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:47,228
Yeah. You know, like an old married couple.

428
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:50,364
Old man's got a couple of weeks off...

429
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,965
...so they go to Florida, someplace warm.

430
00:29:53,065 --> 00:29:54,867
Just you and me?

431
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:58,437
Yeah, why? Is there someone else you're thinking of bringing along?

432
00:29:58,537 --> 00:30:00,537
No, no, I just, um--

433
00:30:01,838 --> 00:30:04,264
Is this a romance we're having?

434
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,933
Is that what it is?

435
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:08,499
Yeah. It could be a romance.

436
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:11,203
Come here.

437
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:18,782
I have a great idea.

438
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:25,222
Do you like Chinese food?

439
00:30:25,322 --> 00:30:27,415
Yes.

440
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:33,530
We're going to have a very romantic dinner right here.

441
00:30:37,464 --> 00:30:39,932
Hey, what's this?
- Oh, yeah.

442
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:40,993
From your editor. Sorry.

443
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:42,459
Somebody sipped it under the door.

444
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:43,693
Hello, Victor?

445
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:45,789
Yeah, it's Seth Bundle.

446
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:50,403
Oh, yeah, I'll wait.
- Oh, no.

447
00:30:50,507 --> 00:30:53,407
What? What's that?

448
00:30:57,745 --> 00:31:01,875
Nothing. It's just, uh, personal bullshit.

449
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:05,017
I thought old married couples shared all their personal bullshit.

450
00:31:05,117 --> 00:31:07,352
That's how they stayed old and married.

451
00:31:07,452 --> 00:31:09,452
Uh, listen.

452
00:31:09,553 --> 00:31:10,835
Seth, don't rush it.

453
00:31:10,861 --> 00:31:12,782
- What are you taking about?

454
00:31:12,857 --> 00:31:15,076
Look, I have to go out for a few hours.

455
00:31:15,102 --> 00:31:15,784
- Now? No.

456
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:18,560
Ronnie, uh, spicy eggplant, champagne.

457
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,660
Just for a few hours.

458
00:31:20,662 --> 00:31:22,764
I still have the residue of another life, you know.

459
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:24,799
I have to... scrape it off my shoe...

460
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:28,129
...and get rid of it once and for all.

461
00:31:30,002 --> 00:31:32,903
Uh, hi--
-

462
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,885
What's this supposed to mean?

463
00:31:52,985 --> 00:31:57,288
It means that I'm your editor, and I'm shaping your material into a story.

464
00:31:57,388 --> 00:32:00,128
You're the one who told me there was no story.

465
00:32:00,228 --> 00:32:02,058
You said Bundle was a con man.

466
00:32:02,158 --> 00:32:04,827
I've decided to trust your journalistic instincts.

467
00:32:04,927 --> 00:32:07,963
Thanks very much, but this is not your story.

468
00:32:08,063 --> 00:32:11,464
It's mine.
- Says who?

469
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:14,835
I sent you to the Bartok party to see what you could find.

470
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:16,936
Your discovery is my discovery.

471
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:19,971
I have a lot of background on Bundle.

472
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:23,375
He's been working on this thing for six years.

473
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:26,377
There's material out there to find if you dig deep.

474
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,741
I dug.
- Stathis--

475
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:32,414
Everything that has to do with transportation will become obsolete.

476
00:32:32,514 --> 00:32:34,783
And I am right there in the middle of it...

477
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:37,317
...the only recorder of the event from the inside out.

478
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:39,417
Okay.

479
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:43,587
Okay.

480
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:49,886
Look, uh-- Just keep me informed, all right?

481
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:52,257
As a friend?

482
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:54,741
As a professional confidant?

483
00:32:55,964 --> 00:32:57,964
That's all?

484
00:33:00,634 --> 00:33:04,289
I don't want you to disappear from my life.

485
00:33:09,608 --> 00:33:11,608
Okay.

486
00:33:14,611 --> 00:33:16,875
What about sex?

487
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,182
I'm not saying love or affection, just stress-relieving sex.

488
00:33:20,282 --> 00:33:22,282
You and me.

489
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:27,178
You're disgusting, as always.

490
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:32,691
Wouldnt want to disappoint you.

491
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:36,887
'Residue' means her old boyfriend, doesn't it?

492
00:33:38,928 --> 00:33:42,489
Stathis Borans is her old boyfriend.

493
00:33:42,597 --> 00:33:45,828
'From the desk of Stathis Borans.'

494
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:48,502
How about, 'Under the desk of Stathis Borans'?

495
00:33:48,602 --> 00:33:50,704
She's working for her old boyfriend.

496
00:33:50,804 --> 00:33:53,039
Now she runs out late at night to see him.

497
00:33:53,139 --> 00:33:55,604
What is this, the Ronnie game?

498
00:33:59,177 --> 00:34:00,457
I'm catching on.

499
00:34:00,483 --> 00:34:01,922
I'm catching on.

500
00:34:03,146 --> 00:34:05,915
I didn't mean to kill your brother.

501
00:34:06,015 --> 00:34:09,718
But he didn't die in vain, if that's of any comfort. End--

502
00:34:09,818 --> 00:34:11,979
As the general said...

503
00:34:12,087 --> 00:34:15,357
'There's nothing I'd ask you to do that I wouldnt do myself, boys.'

504
00:34:17,457 --> 00:34:19,981
Hey, you're all right.

505
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:23,747
From looking at you, I can tell you're okay.

506
00:34:26,696 --> 00:34:28,629
What are we waiting for?

507
00:34:28,655 --> 00:34:29,781
Let's do it.

508
00:36:07,536 --> 00:36:09,629
How you doing?

509
00:36:09,738 --> 00:36:12,138
Now, you tell me...

510
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,639
...am I different somehow?

511
00:36:14,741 --> 00:36:17,801
Is it live, or is it Memorex?

512
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:22,028
It's too bad Ronnie missed it.

513
00:37:22,252 --> 00:37:24,652
I missed you last night.

514
00:37:24,754 --> 00:37:26,345
It's still night.

515
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:27,680
I came back.

516
00:37:27,757 --> 00:37:30,477
You had to celebrate without me.

517
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:32,789
I'm sorry.

518
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:35,103
I went through last night.

519
00:37:36,262 --> 00:37:38,262
You went through?

520
00:37:38,264 --> 00:37:40,559
Without testing the baboon?

521
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,759
I was... drunk.

522
00:37:43,785 --> 00:37:45,727
I was a bit upset.

523
00:37:46,803 --> 00:37:49,438
You could have killed yourself.

524
00:37:56,977 --> 00:38:00,140
Are you sleeping with Stathis Borans?

525
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:02,541
What are you taking about?

526
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:06,525
I-- I don't know. I just, um, get that feeling.

527
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,054
That's why you were upset?

528
00:38:13,656 --> 00:38:15,656
I got jealous.

529
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:19,484
Oh, God. Seth...

530
00:38:19,594 --> 00:38:22,314
...you don't have to be jealous.

531
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:24,763
He's an old boyfriend.

532
00:38:24,831 --> 00:38:26,226
He was teaching at college.

533
00:38:26,252 --> 00:38:27,491
I was a science major.

534
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:30,286
He got me started in journalism.

535
00:38:31,169 --> 00:38:33,634
Is he still in love with you?

536
00:38:34,672 --> 00:38:37,004
How could he not be?

537
00:38:41,009 --> 00:38:43,134
Hey, what about our deal?

538
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:45,746
You went through, and I wasn't there.

539
00:38:45,846 --> 00:38:46,863
Don't worry.

540
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:48,669
I taped it for you.

541
00:38:48,748 --> 00:38:50,748
You did?

542
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:58,139
So, I asked the computer if it had improved me.

543
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:00,340
It said it didn't know what I was taking about.

544
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,109
That's made me think carefully about what I've been feeling and why.

545
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:06,778
I'm beginning to think the sheer process of being taken apart atom by atom...

546
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:08,847
...and put back together again--

547
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:11,056
It's like coffee being put through a filter.

548
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:12,674
It's somehow a purifying process.

549
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:13,436
It's purified me.

550
00:44:13,462 --> 00:44:14,204
It's cleansed me.

551
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,143
And I'II tell you...

552
00:44:15,218 --> 00:44:17,787
I think it's going to allow me to realize...

553
00:44:17,887 --> 00:44:21,323
...the personal potential I've been neglecting all these years...

554
00:44:21,423 --> 00:44:25,726
...that I've been obsessively pursuing goal after goal.

555
00:44:25,826 --> 00:44:27,727
Do you normally take coffee with your sugar?

556
00:44:27,827 --> 00:44:30,352
What? Oh.

557
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:34,298
You know, I just don't think I've ever given me a chance to be me.

558
00:44:34,398 --> 00:44:36,300
But, of course, interestingly...

559
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,001
...at the exact moment that I achieved...

560
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:39,902
...what'll probably prove to be my life's work...

561
00:44:40,002 --> 00:44:42,670
...that's the moment when I started being the real me finally.

562
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:46,170
So, uh, listen-- Not to wax messianic...

563
00:44:46,173 --> 00:44:49,076
...but it may be true that the synchronicity of those two events...

564
00:44:49,176 --> 00:44:51,811
...might blur the resultant individual effect of either individuality.

565
00:44:51,911 --> 00:44:55,514
But it is, uh, nevertheless also certainly true...

566
00:44:55,614 --> 00:44:57,681
I will say now however subjectively...

567
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:02,051
...that human teleportation-- molecular
decimation, breakdown and reformation--...

568
00:45:02,151 --> 00:45:03,505
...is inherently purging--

569
00:45:03,531 --> 00:45:04,779
it makes a man a king.

570
00:45:04,854 --> 00:45:07,623
From the moment I walked out, I felt like a million bucks.

571
00:45:07,723 --> 00:45:09,991
I think I am gonna have a cannoli after all.

572
00:45:10,091 --> 00:45:12,627
Waiter. I mean, w-what an accomplishment.

573
00:45:12,727 --> 00:45:14,149
But what have I really done?

574
00:45:14,175 --> 00:45:16,054
AII I've done is say to the word...

575
00:45:16,129 --> 00:45:17,238
'Let's go. Move.

576
00:45:17,264 --> 00:45:18,856
Catch me if you can.'

577
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:21,832
Waiter. Jesus Christ.
-

578
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:36,542
Oh, God. Wait.

579
00:45:36,543 --> 00:45:39,034
What?
- Uh-- Oh, God.

580
00:45:40,812 --> 00:45:43,679
What?

581
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,012
How can you keep going?

582
00:45:47,485 --> 00:45:49,261
You can't have any-- have any

583
00:45:49,287 --> 00:45:50,879
fluid left in your body.

584
00:45:50,954 --> 00:45:53,055
We've been doing this for hours.

585
00:45:53,155 --> 00:45:55,535
I-I'm not ready to quit yet.

586
00:45:55,591 --> 00:45:57,786
Come on.
- Oh--...

587
00:45:57,892 --> 00:45:59,892
Come on.
- Oh--

588
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,629
Mm. Hey. What's this?

589
00:46:06,732 --> 00:46:08,867
It's an attempt to distract me, that's what it is.

590
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:10,967
No, really,
what is it?

591
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:14,029
It's like...
hairs or something.

592
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,504
I don't know.
It's, uh--

593
00:46:16,606 --> 00:46:17,935
It happens when you get older.

594
00:46:17,961 --> 00:46:19,200
Weird hair configurations.

595
00:46:19,275 --> 00:46:21,971
They're really coarse.

596
00:46:22,077 --> 00:46:24,010
Well, I've never really been hairy enough.

597
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,695
You know what I mean?

598
00:46:25,721 --> 00:46:27,304
Airways too boyish.

599
00:46:27,379 --> 00:46:30,015
I'm Looking forward to a hairy body.

600
00:46:30,115 --> 00:46:31,857
It's one of the compensations of old age.

601
00:46:31,883 --> 00:46:33,209
Come here. Where are you going?

602
00:46:33,284 --> 00:46:35,284
Let me go.

603
00:46:36,587 --> 00:46:38,587
You're let go.

604
00:47:06,009 --> 00:47:07,559
Hey, hey, hey.
Not my new hairs.

605
00:47:07,585 --> 00:47:08,602
What are you doing?

606
00:47:08,677 --> 00:47:10,677
Relax, Bundle.

607
00:47:10,778 --> 00:47:13,615
I don't really think you want a body covered with these.

608
00:47:13,715 --> 00:47:17,411
God.. They're really tough.

609
00:47:20,085 --> 00:47:22,086
Listen. I want you to go through.

610
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:24,221
I want to teleport you as soon as possible.

611
00:47:24,321 --> 00:47:24,864
Right now.

612
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,247
Youll feel incredible.

613
00:47:26,322 --> 00:47:29,025
Ronnie, I hardily need to sleep anymore and I feel wonderful.

614
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:31,493
It's like a drug, but a perfectly pure and benign drug.

615
00:47:31,593 --> 00:47:33,495
The power I feel surging inside me--

616
00:47:33,595 --> 00:47:34,563
I won't wear you out.

617
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:35,908
We'll be the perfect couple.

618
00:47:35,934 --> 00:47:36,781
The dynamic duo.

619
00:47:36,831 --> 00:47:38,732
Come on. Right now.
- Hey, wait.

620
00:47:38,832 --> 00:47:40,083
Don't give me that born-again...

621
00:47:40,183 --> 00:47:40,955
...teleportation rap.

622
00:47:40,981 --> 00:47:42,192
I told you I'm scared to do it.

623
00:47:42,267 --> 00:47:44,218
W-What do I have to say?

624
00:47:44,244 --> 00:47:46,032
I'm not gonna do it.

625
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:49,669
You're a fucking drag, you know that.

626
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:53,252
Something went wrong, Seth.

627
00:47:53,352 --> 00:47:57,007
When you went through, something went wrong.

628
00:48:02,697 --> 00:48:05,300
No? If not you, if you're too chickenshit...

629
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,304
...to be a member of the dynamic duo club, okay, then great.

630
00:48:08,404 --> 00:48:11,575
I'II find somebody else, somebody who can keep up with me.

631
00:48:11,675 --> 00:48:13,477
Seth, you have to listen to me.

632
00:48:13,577 --> 00:48:15,948
You're afraid to dive into the plasma pool, aren't you?

633
00:48:16,048 --> 00:48:18,317
You're afraid to be destroyed and recreated, aren't you?

634
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:21,188
I'II bet you think you woke me up about the flesh, don't you?

635
00:48:21,288 --> 00:48:24,792
But you only know society's straight line about the flesh.

636
00:48:24,892 --> 00:48:29,766
You can't penetrate beyond society's sick, gray fear of the flesh.

637
00:48:29,866 --> 00:48:32,637
Drink deep or taste not the plasma spring.

638
00:48:32,737 --> 00:48:34,737
See what I'm saying?

639
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,876
I'm not just taking about sex and penetration.

640
00:48:36,976 --> 00:48:40,081
I'm taking about penetration beyond the veil of the flesh--...

641
00:48:40,181 --> 00:48:44,261
...a deep, penetrating dive into the plasma pool.

642
00:49:12,256 --> 00:49:14,451
####

643
00:49:27,143 --> 00:49:29,611
I'II have a scotch.

644
00:49:31,182 --> 00:49:33,182
Who's winning?

645
00:49:34,854 --> 00:49:36,194
I don't know.

646
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,280
I hope it's Marky.

647
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:43,421
How come?
- Because...

648
00:49:43,532 --> 00:49:45,532
I like Marky tonight.

649
00:49:45,602 --> 00:49:47,763
Well, I like you tonight.

650
00:49:47,871 --> 00:49:51,440
Maybe I'd better get involved in this too.

651
00:49:54,012 --> 00:49:56,048
Hey, pal, you're disturbing us.

652
00:49:56,148 --> 00:50:00,398
I got 1 00 bucks says I can beat either one of you.

653
00:50:03,091 --> 00:50:05,091
Take a hike, asshole.

654
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:07,128
Here.

655
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:11,059
Here's my 1 00...

656
00:50:11,169 --> 00:50:13,739
...and I take the lady home for the night if I win.

657
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,366
Says who? Do I look like a hooker to you?

658
00:50:17,477 --> 00:50:19,953
Hey, Tawny, it's an easy 1 00.

659
00:50:19,979 --> 00:50:23,197
Come on, pal. Let's get it over with.

660
00:50:25,054 --> 00:50:25,932
Better watch out.

661
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:27,249
He eats chocolate bars.

662
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:29,324
Yeah, so I noticed.

663
00:50:35,936 --> 00:50:38,996
I don't think he has a chance.

664
00:51:13,285 --> 00:51:16,083
My arm.

665
00:51:17,725 --> 00:51:17,892
Are you a bodybuilder or something?

666
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,962
Are you a bodybuilder or something?

667
00:51:20,062 --> 00:51:21,059
Yeah, I build bodies.

668
00:51:21,085 --> 00:51:23,791
I take them apart, then I put them back together again.

669
00:51:23,866 --> 00:51:26,767
Well, you sure took Marky apart.

670
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,754
Let's go back to my place.

671
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,866
- Your place?

672
00:51:29,941 --> 00:51:31,088
Yeah, well, okay.

673
00:51:31,114 --> 00:51:33,203
I live with my mother anyway.

674
00:51:33,278 --> 00:51:36,215
But, uh, can we go to maybe a few more bars first?

675
00:51:36,315 --> 00:51:38,485
I mean, it's a little too early to quit.

676
00:51:38,585 --> 00:51:40,585
Sure, a few more bars.

677
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:08,755
Great place.

678
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,860
Hey.

679
00:52:16,504 --> 00:52:18,836
There's no elevator.

680
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,238
I can't make it.

681
00:52:20,264 --> 00:52:22,535
- No, there's an elevator.

682
00:52:24,647 --> 00:52:27,844
There. Don't you feel elevated?

683
00:52:29,788 --> 00:52:31,788
Whoa.

684
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:38,792
Oh.

685
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,959
Ooh.

686
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:43,095
Ooh..

687
00:53:07,705 --> 00:53:09,705
Wow.

688
00:53:17,753 --> 00:53:20,303
Are you some sort of magician?

689
00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:26,828
Yes.

690
00:53:37,745 --> 00:53:40,441
Ahhh.

691
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:47,984
Ooh.
-

692
00:53:53,634 --> 00:53:56,779
So? Are we going to breakfast or not?

693
00:53:59,108 --> 00:54:00,655
It's your turn.

694
00:54:00,681 --> 00:54:02,227
- To do what?

695
00:54:02,312 --> 00:54:04,615
I want you to go through.
- No.

696
00:54:04,715 --> 00:54:06,080
I don't want to try that.

697
00:54:06,106 --> 00:54:08,178
- Why not? It'll make you feel sexy.

698
00:54:08,253 --> 00:54:11,552
But I already feel sexy.

699
00:54:11,658 --> 00:54:17,563
How 'bout... a nice alcohol rub?

700
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:21,864
Don't do that.
It hurts.

701
00:54:21,971 --> 00:54:24,166
Sorry, hon.

702
00:54:24,274 --> 00:54:27,847
I didn't know you had the skin of a princess.

703
00:54:27,947 --> 00:54:29,212
You're real sensitive, huh?

704
00:54:29,238 --> 00:54:29,940
- Okay, okay.

705
00:54:30,015 --> 00:54:32,051
That's it.
You're going to like it.

706
00:54:32,151 --> 00:54:33,294
I don't want to.

707
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,247
I'm afraid.

708
00:54:34,322 --> 00:54:36,322
Don't be afraid.
- No.

709
00:54:36,324 --> 00:54:37,668
Be afraid.

710
00:54:37,694 --> 00:54:39,978
Be very afraid.

711
00:54:40,062 --> 00:54:42,223
Who's this?

712
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:43,687
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

713
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,228
I live with my mother too.

714
00:54:45,303 --> 00:54:47,303
mum, meet Tawny.

715
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:50,875
I gotta go.

716
00:54:55,483 --> 00:54:57,863
Thanks for a wonderful time.

717
00:55:07,065 --> 00:55:10,501
Why'd you scare her off?
Jealous?

718
00:55:10,603 --> 00:55:14,061
You're changing, Seth.

719
00:55:14,174 --> 00:55:16,545
Everything about you is changing.

720
00:55:16,645 --> 00:55:18,977
You look bad.

721
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,080
You smell bad.

722
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,956
I've never been much of a bather.

723
00:55:25,925 --> 00:55:30,263
Those... weird hairs that were growing
out of your back, I took them to a lab.

724
00:55:30,363 --> 00:55:32,363
I had them analysed.

725
00:55:35,704 --> 00:55:38,104
The hairs?

726
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:41,309
The hairs?

727
00:55:41,412 --> 00:55:44,727
Oh. Yeah, that's a strange thing to do.

728
00:55:44,783 --> 00:55:47,547
Not as strange as the results.

729
00:55:47,653 --> 00:55:50,857
The guy at the lab had trouble identifying them.

730
00:55:50,957 --> 00:55:52,926
He finally came to the conclusion...

731
00:55:53,026 --> 00:55:54,929
...that they were definitely not human.

732
00:55:55,029 --> 00:55:57,429
Oh. Very good.

733
00:55:57,533 --> 00:56:00,263
Not human, Seth.

734
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:04,397
In fact, very likely insect hairs.

735
00:56:04,508 --> 00:56:06,578
That's silly.
That's ridiculous.

736
00:56:06,678 --> 00:56:08,699
Look. Now there's more.

737
00:56:08,725 --> 00:56:10,833
Uh, look at your face.

738
00:56:10,917 --> 00:56:13,121
Something happened when you went through, Seth.

739
00:56:13,221 --> 00:56:14,819
You've got to get some help.

740
00:56:14,845 --> 00:56:16,384
I think you must be sick.

741
00:56:16,459 --> 00:56:18,825
You're jealous.

742
00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:21,959
I've become free.

743
00:56:21,985 --> 00:56:24,261
I've been released, and you can't stand it.

744
00:56:24,336 --> 00:56:26,539
Youll do anything to bring me down.

745
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:29,283
Look at me. Does this look sick?

746
00:56:29,309 --> 00:56:32,614
Does this look like a sick man to you?

747
00:56:32,948 --> 00:56:33,509
No. Stop it.

748
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,984
- Do you know any sick men...

749
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:36,553
...who can do that? Come here.

750
00:56:36,653 --> 00:56:37,254
No. Seth.

751
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,061
- Deal's off.

752
00:56:38,087 --> 00:56:39,707
I don't need you anymore.

753
00:56:39,757 --> 00:56:42,351
No, wait. Seth, please.

754
00:56:42,377 --> 00:56:43,842
Wait. Seth.

755
00:56:43,928 --> 00:56:46,192
Don't come back.

756
00:56:46,297 --> 00:56:48,297
Oh, God.

757
00:56:57,613 --> 00:56:59,911
Oh, God.

758
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:03,714
Oh. Oh, God.

759
00:57:03,822 --> 00:57:05,822
Oh, God.

760
00:57:42,907 --> 00:57:44,907
Ow.

761
00:59:01,146 --> 00:59:03,146
Oh, no.

762
00:59:04,483 --> 00:59:06,380
What's happening to me?

763
00:59:06,406 --> 00:59:07,477
Am I dying?

764
00:59:09,257 --> 00:59:11,123
Is this how it starts?

765
00:59:11,149 --> 00:59:12,251
Am I dying?

766
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:17,624
Bundle, Seth.

767
00:59:17,734 --> 00:59:20,066
Give me a disk.

768
00:59:20,171 --> 00:59:24,081
Uh, I need the first teleportation, S. Bundle.

769
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:00,890
Run sequence.

790
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,143
Hello.

791
01:01:59,084 --> 01:02:01,084
Seth.

792
01:02:02,755 --> 01:02:05,551
Seth, I've been trying to reach you.

793
01:02:05,577 --> 01:02:06,819
Where are you?

794
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:09,999
For the last four weeks, I've been afraid to see you.

795
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:13,364
Now, I'm... afraid not to.

796
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:14,303
Where are you?

797
01:02:14,329 --> 01:02:15,398
Are you at home?

798
01:02:15,473 --> 01:02:17,675
Veronica, you don't know how right you were.

799
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,869
I've gotten...

800
01:02:19,895 --> 01:02:22,737
much, much worse.

801
01:02:22,816 --> 01:02:25,256
Please come to see me.

802
01:02:25,282 --> 01:02:27,278
Please come now.

803
01:02:51,754 --> 01:02:55,019
Seth? I'm here.

804
01:02:55,126 --> 01:02:57,126
Stop.

805
01:02:58,397 --> 01:03:00,397
Seth.

806
01:03:03,103 --> 01:03:05,162
You were right.

807
01:03:05,273 --> 01:03:10,233
I'm diseased and, uh, might be contagious somehow.

808
01:03:12,048 --> 01:03:16,485
I wouldnt want to infect you.

809
01:03:16,588 --> 01:03:19,250
And it's been accelerating.

810
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:20,561
It's unrelenting.

811
01:03:20,587 --> 01:03:22,922
Every day there are... changes.

812
01:03:22,997 --> 01:03:26,068
Every time I look in the mirror there's someone different, hideous, repulsive.

813
01:03:26,168 --> 01:03:27,837
What happened?

814
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:32,075
# I know an old lady who swallowed a fly Perhaps she'll die ##

815
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:34,506
Seth, please.

816
01:03:36,614 --> 01:03:37,657
I was not pure.

817
01:03:37,683 --> 01:03:40,576
The teleporter insisted on inner purity.

818
01:03:40,602 --> 01:03:41,713
I was not pure.

819
01:03:41,788 --> 01:03:44,552
I don't know what you mean.

820
01:03:47,462 --> 01:03:49,623
A fly...

821
01:03:49,732 --> 01:03:54,107
...got into the... transmitter pod with
me that first time when I was alone.

822
01:03:58,411 --> 01:04:00,255
Uh, the computer...

823
01:04:00,281 --> 01:04:01,735
got confused.

824
01:04:01,816 --> 01:04:04,318
There weren't supposed to be two separate genetic patterns...

825
01:04:04,418 --> 01:04:08,218
...and it decided to, uh, spIice us together.

826
01:04:08,324 --> 01:04:10,724
It mated us, me and the fly.

827
01:04:10,827 --> 01:04:14,227
We hadn't even been properly introduced.

828
01:04:16,902 --> 01:04:21,601
My teleporter turned her into a gene splicer...

829
01:04:21,709 --> 01:04:26,468
...a very good one, and now I'm not Seth Bundle anymore.

830
01:04:26,514 --> 01:04:29,818
I'm the offspring of Bundle and housefly.

831
01:04:29,918 --> 01:04:32,512
Oh, God.

832
01:04:32,623 --> 01:04:35,114
No.
- Oh, God. Seth.

833
01:04:35,226 --> 01:04:37,226
You look so pretty.

834
01:04:37,296 --> 01:04:39,296
What will happen?

835
01:04:39,365 --> 01:04:42,303
Oh, I think it's showing itself as a bizarre form of cancer...

836
01:04:42,403 --> 01:04:43,197
Oh, no.

837
01:04:43,223 --> 01:04:46,399
- and general celluIar chaos and revolution.

838
01:04:46,474 --> 01:04:48,544
I'm, uh, just going to have to disintegrate.

839
01:04:48,644 --> 01:04:50,881
In a novel way, no doubt.

840
01:04:50,907 --> 01:04:52,696
And then I'II die.

841
01:04:52,784 --> 01:04:54,939
And then itll be over.

842
01:04:54,965 --> 01:04:56,370
- No, no, no.

843
01:04:56,455 --> 01:04:57,295
I don't accept that.

844
01:04:57,321 --> 01:04:58,917
There must be something we can do...

845
01:04:58,992 --> 01:05:01,194
...somebody we can go to, tests that can be done.

846
01:05:01,294 --> 01:05:06,061
No.
Um, I won't be just another tumorous bore...

847
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:07,925
...taking endlessly about his...

848
01:05:07,951 --> 01:05:10,366
hair failing out and his lost lymph nodes.

849
01:05:10,441 --> 01:05:12,977
Then what do you want me to do?

850
01:05:13,003 --> 01:05:14,801
Why did you call me?

851
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:27,489
Oh.

852
01:05:29,766 --> 01:05:32,394
Oh, that-- that's disgusting.

853
01:05:33,604 --> 01:05:35,834
Uh.

854
01:05:42,684 --> 01:05:46,552
My... ear. No.

855
01:05:48,057 --> 01:05:50,184
I'm scared.

856
01:05:52,363 --> 01:05:54,363
Help me.

857
01:05:55,602 --> 01:05:58,571
Please. Please help me.

858
01:06:06,382 --> 01:06:08,085
Don't go back to him.

859
01:06:08,185 --> 01:06:09,377
That's it?

860
01:06:09,403 --> 01:06:11,906
That's your advice?

861
01:06:11,989 --> 01:06:13,010
He's right, don't you see?

862
01:06:13,036 --> 01:06:14,017
It could be contagious.

863
01:06:14,092 --> 01:06:15,661
It could turn into an epidemic.

864
01:06:15,687 --> 01:06:17,154
- I have to go back to him.

865
01:06:17,229 --> 01:06:18,832
I don't believe this.

866
01:06:18,932 --> 01:06:21,423
If you saw him, Stathis--...

867
01:06:21,536 --> 01:06:24,740
...if you saw how scared and angry and desperate he is--

868
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,965
I'm sure Typhoid Mary was a nice person too...

869
01:06:27,065 --> 01:06:28,244
...when you saw her socially.

870
01:06:28,344 --> 01:06:30,031
Listen, I do not want you going--

871
01:06:30,057 --> 01:06:31,640
- I don't care what you want.

872
01:06:31,715 --> 01:06:33,715
AII right, fine.

873
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:49,006
Do I have permission to claim your body when this is all over?

874
01:06:49,106 --> 01:06:51,574
Oh, God.

875
01:06:54,746 --> 01:06:56,746
Look, how about this?

876
01:06:59,286 --> 01:07:02,366
You say if only I saw him.

877
01:07:02,392 --> 01:07:03,576
Show me.

878
01:07:03,658 --> 01:07:06,491
Tape him. Show me.

879
01:07:06,596 --> 01:07:09,064
Let me think about it.

880
01:07:11,001 --> 01:07:13,970
I'II come up with something.

881
01:07:40,074 --> 01:07:42,074
Seth?

882
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:50,952
Seth?
- No, no. Up here.

883
01:07:51,056 --> 01:07:53,055
Oh.

884
01:07:54,826 --> 01:07:57,397
Gotten pretty good at it, haven't I?

885
01:07:57,497 --> 01:08:00,625
Yeah, it's almost second nature.

886
01:08:00,735 --> 01:08:02,775
Stopped biting my nails.

887
01:08:08,246 --> 01:08:09,326
Oh, look at this.

888
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:10,240
What's this?

889
01:08:10,315 --> 01:08:12,579
I don't know.

890
01:08:16,489 --> 01:08:20,184
I seem to be stricken by a disease with a purpose, wouldnt you say?

891
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,739
Maybe not such a...
bad disease after all.

892
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:29,839
I can't stay here.

893
01:08:29,908 --> 01:08:32,069
No, no, no.

894
01:08:32,177 --> 01:08:33,076
Why not?

895
01:08:33,102 --> 01:08:34,898
Why can't you?

896
01:08:34,982 --> 01:08:35,966
I can't take it.

897
01:08:35,992 --> 01:08:36,975
It's too much.

898
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:37,924
What's there to take?

899
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:39,780
The disease has just revealed its purpose.

900
01:08:39,855 --> 01:08:42,325
We don't have to worry about contagion anymore.

901
01:08:42,425 --> 01:08:44,279
I know what the disease wants.

902
01:08:44,305 --> 01:08:46,221
- What does the disease want?

903
01:08:46,296 --> 01:08:50,062
It wants to... turn me into something else.

904
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:52,137
That's not too terrible, is it?

905
01:08:52,237 --> 01:08:55,041
Most people would give anything to be turned into something else.

906
01:08:55,141 --> 01:08:56,214
Turned into what?

907
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,070
- What do you think, a fly?

908
01:08:58,145 --> 01:09:00,382
Am I becoming a 1 85-pound fly?

909
01:09:00,482 --> 01:09:03,986
No, I'm becoming something that never existed before.

910
01:09:04,086 --> 01:09:06,611
I'm becoming Brundlefly.

911
01:09:06,724 --> 01:09:09,828
Don't you think that's worth a Nobel Prize or two?

912
01:09:09,928 --> 01:09:12,055
Here.

913
01:09:13,433 --> 01:09:16,698
I want to give a demonstration...

914
01:09:16,804 --> 01:09:20,504
...that I think you'll want to, uh, record for posterity.

915
01:09:22,612 --> 01:09:24,915
I think you must chronicle...

916
01:09:25,015 --> 01:09:28,153
...the life and times of Brundlefly, don't you?

917
01:09:28,253 --> 01:09:32,626
At the very least, it should make a fabulous childrens book.

918
01:09:32,726 --> 01:09:34,726
You seem tired.

919
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,962
You got me there?

920
01:09:43,305 --> 01:09:45,432
How does Brundlefly eat?

921
01:09:45,543 --> 01:09:49,581
He found out the hard and painful way that he eats much the way a fly eats.

922
01:09:49,681 --> 01:09:51,817
His teeth are now useless because...

923
01:09:51,917 --> 01:09:55,189
...although he can chew up solid food, he can't digest it.

924
01:09:55,289 --> 01:09:58,281
Solid food hurts.
So, like a fly...

925
01:09:58,392 --> 01:10:03,386
Brundlefly breaks down solids with a corrosive enzyme...

926
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,570
...playfully called vomit drop.

927
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:08,641
He regurgitates on his food, it liquefies...

928
01:10:08,741 --> 01:10:11,343
...and then he sucks it back up.

929
01:10:11,443 --> 01:10:14,241
Ready for a demonstration, kids?

930
01:10:14,347 --> 01:10:16,347
Here goes.

931
01:10:16,418 --> 01:10:19,649
Oh, my God.

932
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:23,921
My God.

933
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:32,733
Hey, Ronnie?
-

934
01:10:35,308 --> 01:10:37,308
Ronnie?

935
01:10:45,321 --> 01:10:48,119
What is it?

936
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:55,399
I'm pregnant.

937
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:57,938
Oh, no.

938
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:03,269
Oh, no.

939
01:11:05,082 --> 01:11:07,632
I'm pregnant with Seth's baby.

940
01:11:15,964 --> 01:11:18,489
What do you want to do?

941
01:11:20,535 --> 01:11:23,060
I don't know.

942
01:11:24,975 --> 01:11:28,206
I just-- I don't know.

943
01:11:55,717 --> 01:11:57,717
Stathis, I'm scared.

944
01:11:57,786 --> 01:12:00,089
It's going to be all right, Ronnie.

945
01:12:00,189 --> 01:12:02,189
It's going to be fine.

946
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:04,228
I don't think I want to lose it.

947
01:12:04,328 --> 01:12:05,980
Is there something wrong with me?

948
01:12:06,006 --> 01:12:07,057
Why am I losing it?

949
01:12:07,132 --> 01:12:09,207
It's better this way, Ronnie.

950
01:12:09,233 --> 01:12:10,162
Youll see.

951
01:12:10,237 --> 01:12:12,906
It's the best thing that could happen.

952
01:12:13,006 --> 01:12:14,017
She's expelling it.

953
01:12:14,043 --> 01:12:15,000
It's coming out.

954
01:12:15,075 --> 01:12:17,445
I don't even think we're gonna have to go in.

955
01:12:17,545 --> 01:12:21,345
Oh.
- It's gonna be easy. Don't worry, honey.

956
01:12:21,451 --> 01:12:22,451
No. Please, no.

957
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:24,112
Yeah, there's no problem.

958
01:12:24,138 --> 01:12:25,448
It'll be over soon.

959
01:12:25,523 --> 01:12:28,287
Here we go. Okay.

960
01:12:32,032 --> 01:12:35,934
Just a little suction here, a little suction.

961
01:12:36,038 --> 01:12:38,366
Suction.
Hod it. Hold on a minute.

962
01:12:38,392 --> 01:12:40,034
There's more in there.

963
01:12:40,109 --> 01:12:41,345
There's more?

964
01:12:41,371 --> 01:12:44,127
- Yeah. I mean, a lot more.

965
01:12:44,215 --> 01:12:46,017
Okay.
You're gonna have to help us.

966
01:12:46,043 --> 01:12:46,473
Come on.

967
01:12:46,499 --> 01:12:47,303
You can push.

968
01:12:47,353 --> 01:12:48,622
You can push it out.

969
01:12:48,648 --> 01:12:49,281
Come on.

970
01:12:49,356 --> 01:12:51,258
Oh.
- Push. That's it. Come on.

971
01:12:51,358 --> 01:12:52,746
Push. Use those muscles.
That's it.

972
01:12:52,772 --> 01:12:53,286
- No, wait.

973
01:12:53,361 --> 01:12:54,300
Give us a push.

974
01:12:54,326 --> 01:12:56,390
You can push it out. That's it.

975
01:12:56,465 --> 01:12:58,367
Come on.
- No, wait. Wait. No.

976
01:12:58,467 --> 01:13:00,467
You can do it.
- Oh.

977
01:13:00,471 --> 01:13:02,105
Wait. Oh.

978
01:13:02,205 --> 01:13:04,264
Oh. No.

979
01:13:07,813 --> 01:13:11,305
Oh.. No.. Oh.. Oh..

980
01:14:14,569 --> 01:14:16,730
Oh.

981
01:14:16,839 --> 01:14:17,677
I want a disk.

982
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:19,736
Give me preliminary integration.

983
01:14:19,811 --> 01:14:20,986
I want a disk.

984
01:14:21,012 --> 01:14:23,863
Give me preliminary integration.

985
01:14:23,948 --> 01:14:24,669
I want a disk.

986
01:14:24,695 --> 01:14:26,444
Give me preliminary integration.

987
01:14:26,519 --> 01:14:30,580
I want a disk.
Give me preliminary integration.

988
01:15:06,973 --> 01:15:09,382
You're relics.
Yes, you are.

989
01:15:09,408 --> 01:15:11,128
You can't deny it.

990
01:15:11,211 --> 01:15:15,978
Vestigial, archaeological, redundant.

991
01:15:19,289 --> 01:15:24,124
Artefacts of a bygone era, of historical interest only.

992
01:15:46,392 --> 01:15:49,589
You've missed some good moments.

993
01:15:49,697 --> 01:15:52,757
Is that why you're here, to catch up?

994
01:15:57,274 --> 01:15:59,274
I wanted--

995
01:16:04,917 --> 01:16:08,819
My teeth have begun to fall out.

996
01:16:08,923 --> 01:16:12,928
The medicine cabinet's now the Bundle Museum of Natural History.

997
01:16:13,028 --> 01:16:16,428
You want to see what else is in it?
- No.

998
01:16:18,936 --> 01:16:20,936
Then...

999
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:24,465
...what do you want?

1000
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:30,447
I... came to tell you...

1001
01:16:30,551 --> 01:16:32,551
...um--

1002
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:36,786
I, uh-- I just--

1003
01:16:38,395 --> 01:16:41,364
I wanted to s-see you...

1004
01:16:41,466 --> 01:16:43,466
...before--

1005
01:16:52,014 --> 01:16:55,142
You have to leave now...

1006
01:16:55,251 --> 01:16:57,631
...and never come back here.

1007
01:17:01,926 --> 01:17:05,241
Have you ever heard of insect poetics?

1008
01:17:08,068 --> 01:17:12,095
Neither have I.

1009
01:17:12,207 --> 01:17:17,167
Insects... don't have poetics.

1010
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:22,279
They're very brutal.

1011
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:26,289
No compassion, no compromise.

1012
01:17:27,394 --> 01:17:30,295
We can't trust the insect.

1013
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,031
I'd like to become...

1014
01:17:35,057 --> 01:17:38,530
the first insect politician.

1015
01:17:39,944 --> 01:17:43,072
You see, I'd like to, um, but...

1016
01:17:43,182 --> 01:17:45,980
...oh, I'm afraid, um--

1017
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,435
I don't know what you're trying to say.

1018
01:17:50,693 --> 01:17:53,161
I'm saying--

1019
01:17:58,103 --> 01:18:00,234
I'm saying I'm an insect...

1020
01:18:04,344 --> 01:18:08,178
...who dreamt he was a man and loved it.

1021
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:10,662
But now the dream is over...

1022
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,621
...and the insect is awake.

1023
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:15,918
No, no. No, Seth.

1024
01:18:17,361 --> 01:18:19,829
I'm saying...

1025
01:18:21,968 --> 01:18:24,436
I'II hurt you if you stay.

1026
01:18:46,834 --> 01:18:49,894
No. No.

1027
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:53,768
No.

1028
01:19:01,054 --> 01:19:03,521
No.

1029
01:19:03,623 --> 01:19:04,313
Let's go.

1030
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:05,717
Let's do it now.

1031
01:19:05,792 --> 01:19:07,818
Now?
Wait. Wait a minute.

1032
01:19:07,844 --> 01:19:09,277
What did he say?

1033
01:19:09,297 --> 01:19:11,297
I couldnt tell him.

1034
01:19:11,366 --> 01:19:13,477
Let's go, damn it.
- No.

1035
01:19:13,636 --> 01:19:14,872
We should wait for a few days.

1036
01:19:14,898 --> 01:19:16,999
I don't think you're in the right state of mind--

1037
01:19:17,074 --> 01:19:19,104
No. Now. I want it out of my body now.

1038
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:20,571
You should have seen him.

1039
01:19:20,646 --> 01:19:22,022
There could be anything in here.

1040
01:19:22,048 --> 01:19:22,907
In me. In my body.

1041
01:19:22,982 --> 01:19:25,586
I don't know if I can arrange it right now, tonight.

1042
01:19:25,686 --> 01:19:28,324
Why do we have to run around in the dark like a couple of--...

1043
01:19:28,424 --> 01:19:29,810
'Cause I don't want it in my body.

1044
01:19:29,836 --> 01:19:30,651
You understand me?

1045
01:19:30,726 --> 01:19:33,160
I don't want it in my body.

1046
01:20:07,109 --> 01:20:08,377
Well, okay.

1047
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:10,592
What's the story?

1048
01:20:12,782 --> 01:20:15,086
She's pregnant, and she wants to have an abortion.

1049
01:20:15,186 --> 01:20:17,481
In the middle of the night?

1050
01:20:19,158 --> 01:20:21,595
We have good reason to think that...

1051
01:20:21,695 --> 01:20:25,392
...this... chid will be deformed.

1052
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,526
Yeah, but in the middle of the night?

1053
01:20:28,552 --> 01:20:29,860
- Look, Brent.

1054
01:20:29,973 --> 01:20:31,973
Please.

1055
01:20:34,078 --> 01:20:37,206
Is it your child?
- No.

1056
01:20:37,316 --> 01:20:39,316
It's the--

1057
01:20:40,553 --> 01:20:44,887
It's the chid of...
a man who is deformed.

1058
01:20:46,128 --> 01:20:48,096
Listen, I don't mean to interfere...

1059
01:20:48,196 --> 01:20:52,064
...but I detect a certain... uncertainty here.

1060
01:20:52,168 --> 01:20:55,305
There are tests we can do to determine whether or not this--

1061
01:20:55,405 --> 01:20:57,405
I don't want tests.

1062
01:20:57,409 --> 01:20:59,912
Tests can't guarantee anything.

1063
01:21:00,012 --> 01:21:04,092
The baby could start off normal and then become--

1064
01:21:06,287 --> 01:21:08,755
I want an abortion.

1065
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:13,523
I'II do it myself if I have to.

1066
01:21:13,632 --> 01:21:18,327
Okay, if youll just slip into that, we'll be on our way in no time.

1067
01:21:42,637 --> 01:21:45,629
Oh-- No. No.

1068
01:21:49,145 --> 01:21:51,238
Wait.
Seth, no.

1069
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:19,977
Why did you want to kill Bundle?

1070
01:22:20,088 --> 01:22:25,025
The baby... might be all that's left of the real me.

1071
01:22:27,732 --> 01:22:29,732
Please don't kill me.

1072
01:22:31,202 --> 01:22:33,098
I can't have it.

1073
01:22:33,124 --> 01:22:34,663
I'm afraid.

1074
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:38,676
Please. Have the baby.

1075
01:22:38,778 --> 01:22:42,737
I can't. I can't.

1076
01:22:42,851 --> 01:22:46,287
Too bad.

1077
01:22:51,229 --> 01:22:53,527
Too bad.

1078
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,845
Jesus.

1079
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,451
Ah.

1080
01:25:21,564 --> 01:25:24,192
Let me go.
Let me go.

1081
01:26:24,749 --> 01:26:26,749
No.. Don't..

1082
01:26:26,817 --> 01:26:30,776
Don't, please.
Please.

1083
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:53,608
Help me.

1084
01:26:53,634 --> 01:26:56,077
Help me to be human.

1085
01:26:57,225 --> 01:26:59,225
How?

1086
01:27:01,197 --> 01:27:04,166
Oh.

1087
01:27:06,838 --> 01:27:08,838
Well...

1088
01:27:11,578 --> 01:27:13,705
I go there...

1089
01:27:13,814 --> 01:27:17,409
...and, uh, you go there.

1090
01:27:19,521 --> 01:27:22,686
We... come apart...

1091
01:27:24,796 --> 01:27:29,563
...and... then we...
come together there.

1092
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:34,974
You, me... and the baby.

1093
01:27:35,076 --> 01:27:37,374
Together.

1094
01:27:53,834 --> 01:27:56,302
No.

1095
01:27:56,403 --> 01:27:59,395
Well be the ultimate family.

1096
01:27:59,509 --> 01:28:01,670
A family of three...

1097
01:28:01,778 --> 01:28:04,413
...joined together in one body.

1098
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:07,912
More human than I am alone.

1099
01:28:08,019 --> 01:28:08,821
Oh, no.
No. No, no.

1100
01:28:08,921 --> 01:28:10,088
Oh, no.

1101
01:28:10,114 --> 01:28:12,279
No. No, no.

1102
01:28:22,439 --> 01:28:26,136
No. No. No. No.

1103
01:28:32,385 --> 01:28:33,559
Oh, please.

1104
01:28:33,585 --> 01:28:35,504
Oh, God, please.

1105
01:28:35,589 --> 01:28:37,682
Oh. Oh.

1106
01:28:39,595 --> 01:28:43,895
Oh. No. Oh. Oh.

1107
01:28:44,001 --> 01:28:47,164
God.. No.. No..

1108
01:28:47,272 --> 01:28:49,272
Oh, God..

1109
01:28:49,275 --> 01:28:51,015
Please, don't.

1110
01:28:51,041 --> 01:28:52,531
No, don't.

1111
01:28:52,613 --> 01:28:55,047
No.. No..

1112
01:29:05,531 --> 01:29:07,531
No.

1113
01:29:16,446 --> 01:29:17,371
Please.

1114
01:29:17,397 --> 01:29:20,305
Let me out.
Oh, God.

1115
01:32:26,967 --> 01:32:30,596
No. No, I can't.

1116
01:32:30,705 --> 01:32:34,197
No.. I can't. No.

1117
01:32:37,547 --> 01:32:39,879
No. God.
