1
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:26,635
Only a white man would make a fire
for eeryone to see.

2
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:30,098
Maybe there's more than one.

3
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,734
There might be three or four.

4
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,169
I know three or four...

5
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,713
...who will not be making the trip back home.

6
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,807
We have nothing to show for this trail.

7
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:43,982
We have no rifles.

8
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:46,249
White men are sure to have rifles.

9
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:51,389
It's hard to say how many might be down there.

10
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:01,062
We should forget this and go home.

11
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,004
Then go.

12
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:05,765
I would rather die...

13
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:09,609
...than argue about a single line of smoke
in my own country.

14
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:23,784
He will not quit until we are all dead.

15
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:11,053
Kicking Bird has been keeping to himself
these last few days.

16
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:16,691
I do not like to see our medicine man
walking so alone.

17
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:21,266
What does his wife say?

18
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:24,101
She says that he is keeping to himself.

19
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,674
That's not what I asked you.

20
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:28,370
Well, what did you ask me?

21
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,538
What did she say?

22
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,844
She said that he is keeping
to himself these days.

23
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:37,075
That's what she says.

24
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,385
Make sure that my meat is soft.

25
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,824
My teeth hurt.

26
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:55,962
May I come in?

27
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:11,610
No, let him sit with me.

28
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:19,586
Our country seems good this summer...

29
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:24,099
...but I have not been out to see it.

30
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:28,963
But the buffalo are late.

31
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:32,633
And I always worry
about the bellies of our children.

32
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:38,342
I was thinking of a dance.

33
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:42,214
Yes. A dance is always a good idea.

34
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:47,518
It would be good to have a strong sign.

35
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,402
There's a funny thing about signs.

36
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:08,069
We know when they are bad or good.

37
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:13,839
Sometimes they are strange
and it's hard to understand them.

38
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:16,715
A smart man will think on these things.

39
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:21,847
If he is still confused, he will tell somebody.

40
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,553
For instance, he might tell you or me.

41
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:26,595
A smart man always does this.

42
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,068
I have seen such a sign.

43
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:37,631
Really?

44
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,056
I saw a man.

45
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:57,183
A naked, white man.

46
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,887
Are you sure it was a man?

47
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:03,324
I saw his sex.

48
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:07,192
Did you speak to him?

49
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:11,065
No.

50
01:00:57,453 --> 01:01:01,321
He might be a god.

51
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:06,294
Or a white chief with special abilities.

52
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:08,728
That is why we should talk with him.

53
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:14,165
I do not care for this talk about this white man.

54
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:18,071
Whatever he is, he is not a Sioux,
and that makes him less.

55
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:22,510
When I hear that more whites are coming,
I want to laugh.

56
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:24,910
We took a hundred horses from these people.

57
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,381
There was no honor in it.

58
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:30,142
They don't ride well. They don't shoot well.

59
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:33,017
They're dirty.

60
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:36,889
Those soldiers could not even make it
through one winter here.

61
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:39,926
And these people are said to flourish?

62
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:42,487
I think they will all be dead soon.

63
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:48,597
I think this fool is probably lost.

64
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:57,638
Wind In His Hair's words are strong
and I have heard them.

65
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,706
It's true the whites are a poor race
and hard to understand.

66
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:04,142
But make no mistake. The whites are coming.

67
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,347
Even our enemies agree on this.

68
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:10,085
So when I see one man alone
without fear in our country...

69
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:14,926
...I do not think he is lost.
I think he may have medicine.

70
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:18,433
I see someone who might speak...

71
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:21,732
...for all the white people who are coming.

72
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:26,138
I think this is a person
with which treaties might be struck.

73
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:35,450
Kicking Bird is always looking ahead
and that is good.

74
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:39,682
But this man cannot cover our lodges
or feed our children.

75
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:43,522
He is nothing to us.

76
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,356
I will take some men.

77
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,555
We will shoot some arrows into this white man.

78
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:51,259
If he truly has medicine, he will not be hurt.

79
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:54,064
If he has no medicine, he will be dead.

80
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:03,003
No man can tell another what to do.

81
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:06,480
But killing a white man is a delicate matter.

82
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:10,576
If you kill one, more are sure to come.

83
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:20,622
It's easy to become confused
by these questions.

84
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:23,221
It's hard to know what to do.

85
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,737
We should talk about this some more.

86
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:32,570
That is all I have to say.

87
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:09,543
What's the matter, now?

88
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:12,274
We don't think this is such a good idea.

89
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:15,347
If we take the horse of a white god...

90
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,648
...they will make up songs about us.

91
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,655
Maybe.

92
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:23,087
They will ask us to go on raids.

93
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:26,185
Who gets the horse?

94
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,251
I do.

95
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:33,698
I do, but we share. Now who can say
this is not a great plan?

96
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,935
It's always the same.

97
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:42,505
Every time.

98
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:18,377
We'll be heroes.

99
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,714
They'll write songs about us.

100
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,923
What happened?

101
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:47,269
I don't know. My arm doesn't work.

102
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:53,575
You shouldn't have fallen off.
Now we'll get in trouble.

103
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:56,276
It was your idea.

104
01:05:56,352 --> 01:06:01,813
My idea was only to take the horse,
not fall down.

105
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:08,454
Otter hurt himself.

106
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,658
What are you looking at?
I'm the one who's hurt.

107
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:18,139
I will be when my father finds out.
His bow will be across my back.

108
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:45,010
I am Wind In His Hair.

109
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,647
I am Wind In His Hair.

110
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:53,059
Do you see that I am not afraid of you?

111
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,785
Do you see?

112
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:11,406
The party that went against the Utes
is coming back.

113
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:15,510
There are many hearts on the ground.
