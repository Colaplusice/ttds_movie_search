{2578}{2623}My dear children,
{2633}{2748}It is now better than several years|since I moved to New York
{2753}{2851}and I haven't seen you|as much as I would like to.
{2863}{2954}I hope you will come to this ceremony|ofPapal honors,
{2957}{3014}given for my charitable work.
{3074}{3149}The only wealth in this world is children.
{3153}{3228}More than all the money and power|on Earth.
{3247}{3304}You are my treasure.
{3340}{3396}Anthony and Mary,
{3400}{3513}although I entrusted your education to|your mother for your own best interest,
{3518}{3666}I look forward to seeing you, and to|a new period of harmony in our lives.
{3693}{3808}Perhaps you might prevail upon your|mother to come to this celebration,
{3813}{3940}and that from time to time, we can all|see each other at family functions.
{3964}{4079}Anyway, I remain your loving father.
{4796}{4868}Hail Mary, full of grace...
{4942}{5016}...blessed art Thou amongst women...
{5021}{5107}...and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb,|Jesus.
{5127}{5223}Holy Mary, mother of God,|pray for us sinners...
{5817}{5961}Almighty God, bless the insignia|of Saint Sebastian the Martyr,
{5966}{6117}that it may contribute to the sacredness|of him to whom it is given.
{6426}{6592}Do you, Michael, promise to be faithful|to the noble purposes of this Order,
{6594}{6704}to have a special care for the poor,|the needy and those who are ill?
{6709}{6755}I do so promise.
{7126}{7196}May the blessing of Almighty God,
{7201}{7318}Father, Son and Holy Spirit
{7323}{7452}descend upon you|and remain with you forever.
{9694}{9776}Vincent, our name is not on the list.
{9821}{9893}Write it in. Mancini. M-A-N-C-l-N-l.
{9955}{10015}- Problem?|- My name isn't on the list.
{10020}{10135}- Then you have to leave immediately.|- You want to dance with me?
{10140}{10202}Joe, it's Vinnie. These are our guests.
{10207}{10274}I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.
{10277}{10332}Welcome to the party.
{11595}{11694}- It's good to see you.|- Good to see you. This is my husband.
{11696}{11763}- Sit down.|- My son, Anthony.
{11775}{11897}The Order of Saint Sebastian is one of|the highest honors the Church awards.
{11902}{11953}It was first granted by Pope...
{11957}{12039}What about Mr. Corleone's connections|with gambling?
{12051}{12096}The press kits have...
{12101}{12190}- And involvement with the underworld?|- Cut the crap.
{12197}{12269}The Pope, the Holy Father himself,
{12274}{12387}has today blessed Michael Corleone.|Do you know better than the Pope?
{12406}{12480}Vincent! She loves you.
{12485}{12528}Yeah?
{12619}{12653}I love you too.
{12799}{12881}Hi, Vincent. I remember you.
{12914}{13012}- From where?|- The last party we were at together.
{13017}{13120}- Did you come to the club?|- No, it was a wedding.
{13144}{13221}I was eight and you were 1 5.
{13231}{13302}I had many girlfriends when I was 1 5.
{13307}{13360}- Eight-year-olds?|- Especially them.
{13410}{13463}Where's Mary?
{13468}{13578}Would somebody please hail Mary?|Excuse me, Your Excellency.
{13588}{13691}You haven't kissed me hello yet.|Relatives always kiss.
{13693}{13782}- Now we're related?|- I'm your little cousin.
{13959}{14043}- Who's your father?|- I'll give you a hint.
{14067}{14110}He's Italian.
{14142}{14199}Mary, we've been waiting for you.
{14204}{14293}Remember to keep your voice low.
{14298}{14365}And smile. Don't forget to smile.
{14839}{14938}The honorary chairman of|the Vito Corleone Foundation:
{14945}{15031}my daughter, Mary Corleone.
{15240}{15285}Thanks.
{15302}{15432}I think I inherited my father's love|for speechmaking. Here it goes.
{15460}{15568}The Vito Corleone Foundation helps|the poor in every country,
{15573}{15683}gives grants to artists,|funds medical research,
{15688}{15803}and is particularly dedicated|to the resurrection of Sicily.
{15806}{15856}Archbishop Gilday,
{15861}{16014}here is 1 00 million dollars for the poor|of Sicily, in the name of Vito Corleone.
{16029}{16096}Don't spend it all in one place.
{16549}{16645}Mary, I'm so proud of you.
{16805}{16849}Michael...
{16853}{16935}You've done a wonderful thing for Sicily.
{16940}{17033}Let's hope that the money gets|to the people who need it.
{17038}{17072}Amen.
{17131}{17191}...the most important part:|Johnny Fontane!
{17393}{17467}Thank you very much.|I'm happy to be here.
{17472}{17599}I would like you to join me in honoring|Commendatore Michael Corleone.
{17709}{17788}I have something special|for our godfather.
{17791}{17899}I happen to know his favourite song.|Michael, where are you going?
{17904}{18004}I'm off to the kitchen|to hear some Tony Bennett records.
{18021}{18086}Your favourite song: "Salsiccia's Own".
{18091}{18177}I'm having a salsiccia sandwich.|I'll be back.
{18990}{19040}Hello, Kay.
{19273}{19352}Congratulations, Michael.|That's quite an honour.
{19354}{19428}But a little expensive, wouldn't you say?
{19484}{19560}- Cake?|- No, thank you.
{19896}{19965}- It's been a long time, hasn't it?|- Yeah.
{19970}{20030}- Eight years.|- Yeah.
{20035}{20093}You look wonderful.
{20167}{20284}Your son has something he wants to|talk to you about. I came here for him.
{21109}{21253}- What's wrong with being a lawyer?|- He wants his life to be in music.
{21284}{21392}Music is great, I love music.|But he should finish what he started.
{21397}{21433}Anthony...
{21438}{21514}- I'm going my own way.|- Your own way?
{21519}{21558}- Professional singer?|- Yes.
{21562}{21644}What happens if you fail?
{21646}{21747}- I won't fail.|- Men always believe that.
{21749}{21845}A law degree is like taking out insurance.
{21850}{21951}- After that you can work for me...|- I will never work for you.
{21970}{22037}I have bad memories.
{22054}{22121}Every family has bad memories.
{22205}{22308}I'll always be your son, but won't have|anything to do with your business.
{22373}{22469}Anthony... finish the law degree.
{22497}{22536}No.
{22939}{23039}Well, that he got from you. That "no".
{23106}{23238}- You could've helped me convince him.|- Convince him of what?
{23243}{23293}Of what?
{23298}{23416}He throws his life away.|He throws greatness away.
{23435}{23492}This is greatness?
{23504}{23617}Now that you're so respectable,|you're more dangerous than ever.
{23619}{23727}I preferred you when you were|just a common Mafia hood.
{23749}{23790}Okay.
{23804}{23893}- Can we talk common sense here?|- All right.
{24053}{24128}Tony knows that you killed Fredo.
{24274}{24353}- What did you come here for?|- To protect my son.
{24358}{24483}Not to see you disguised by your|church. That was a shameful ceremony.
{24583}{24653}I spent my life protecting my son.
{24655}{24744}I spent my life protecting my family!
{24749}{24816}Let's be reasonable, okay?
{24825}{24943}That's your big thing, isn't it, Michael?|Reason.
{24955}{25051}- Backed up by murder.|- Oh, God.
{25084}{25166}- You hate me. You hate me.|- No.
{25171}{25221}I don't hate you.
{25255}{25317}I dread you.
{25382}{25538}I did what I could, Kay, to protect all|of you from the horrors of this world.
{25569}{25636}But you became my horror.
{25854}{25950}The children still love you, though.|Especially Mary.
{26010}{26065}That's something.
{26108}{26209}We can build on that. For their sake.
{26288}{26336}Let's try.
{26338}{26468}Only if you let Tony go free to have|his own life, away from you.
{26643}{26703}I'll let Tony go.
{26744}{26792}Thank you.
{27611}{27669}- Hi.|- Hi.
{27710}{27834}You could hurt somebody with those.|Let me show you around.
{27839}{27897}Can you get me an interview|with Corleone?
{27902}{28024}No. I'm a relative, but I can't do that.|What else can I do for you?
{28038}{28105}- Handsome, but useless.|- Oh, yeah?
{28110}{28182}- That's okay, I'll gamble.|- Do you like to gamble?
{28185}{28278}Let's go to Atlantic City.|I'll show you how to gamble.
{28283}{28381}- How will I know what numbers to bet?|- Do I look like a loser?
{28386}{28434}Well...
{28479}{28537}Spooky-looking guy there.
{28551}{28666}- What's a guy like that doing here?|- That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.
{28671}{28736}- You know him?|- Yeah, I do.
{28738}{28856}His name is Anthony Squigilaro.|They call him "The Ant".
{28861}{28935}He dips his bullets in cyanide.
{29134}{29189}Don Altobello.
{29208}{29302}- I've come to pay my respects.|- Grazie.
{29374}{29438}You honour my father's friendship.
{29443}{29527}Where is my god-daughter?
{29532}{29599}- Constanza!|- Don Altobello.
{29602}{29717}It was not so long ago|that I held you in these old hands.
{29908}{30031}Michael, I've lost all the venom,|all the juice of youth.
{30035}{30172}I've lost the lust for women,|and now my mind is clear.
{30177}{30340}My duty to God is clear.|I have a special favour to ask of you.
{30366}{30544}Can I attach my name|to the Vito Corleone Foundation,
{30549}{30683}so that you and I can be joined|in name and spirit?
{30731}{30848}- One million dollars.|- A lot of money...
{30915}{31011}- Godfather.|- Don Altobello, you have such a heart.
{31086}{31186}Come, let's go and sample|some of that old vino.
{31347}{31426}The Vatican knows nothing|about these shareholders.
{31431}{31464}Good.
{31467}{31584}I have a tendency to worry. We've|increased our position substantially.
{31589}{31716}- Naturally, I worry.|- Stop worrying, we have an agreement.
{31721}{31817}Good. How do you think|I got this grey hair?
{31822}{31927}Two seconds... Thank you for your|contribution to the swimming-pool.
{31932}{32030}We need your help on Sam Wallace's|candidacy for judgeship.
{32035}{32095}- We can always use a good judge.|- Thanks.
{32097}{32136}Andrew!
{32141}{32239}My godson Andrew Hagen.|My brother Tom's eldest boy.
{32244}{32340}He's been assistant to Bishop Breelan|for three years.
{32344}{32445}- Hopes to be assigned to the Vatican.|- Rome needs fine young priests.
{32448}{32529}His mother Theresa Hagen,|Bishop Gilday.
{32539}{32579}Honoured to meet you.
{32589}{32663}Mr. Corleone. Hi. Grace Hamilton.
{32687}{32802}Vincent Mancini promised to tell you|about me, that maybe you'd see me.
{32805}{32884}- Did Vincent Mancini call about her?|- No.
{32889}{32968}- You promised to stay out there, twice.|- I know.
{33021}{33109}Joey Zasa showed up.|He's waiting in the lobby.
{33114}{33210}He wants to personally|congratulate you. Show his respect.
{33215}{33339}- Do I have to see him?|- He says you're his patron.
{33421}{33474}Hey, Vinnie!
{33486}{33555}- Who's your favourite aunt?|- You are.
{33615}{33701}Today I'll talk to Michael|about your little problem.
{33716}{33807}If you'd warned me, I would have|worn a better suit.
{33831}{33905}The Meucci Association|has elected you
{33910}{33977}Italian-American Man of the Year.
{34011}{34066}Meucci...
{34119}{34179}Who's Meucci?
{34183}{34322}The Italian-American who invented|the telephone, one year before Bell.
{34418}{34495}And this is the reason|you've come today?
{34668}{34723}I...
{34771}{34831}I've got a stone in my shoe.
{34867}{34936}A two-bit punk who works for me.
{34941}{35039}The one who thinks he's related to you.
{35080}{35128}A bastard.
{35207}{35317}He's here. Vincent Mancini.|He's at the party.
{35389}{35437}Bring him in.
{35464}{35543}I think it's good that we talk.
{35550}{35600}No, grazie.
{35639}{35696}I have a problem...
{35701}{35852}...and I want to find out if it is|my problem or your problem.
{35855}{35991}Your business is your business. I have|no interests or percentages from it.
{36006}{36094}Good. Then it's my problem.
{36188}{36288}Michael, you know Vincent Mancini.|Sonny's boy.
{36346}{36418}- How are you, Mr. Corleone?|- How are you?
{36423}{36509}- Good. How are you? Good party.|- You like it?
{36514}{36593}- Yes, I had to sneak in.|- You're dressed for it.
{36703}{36816}So, what's the trouble|between you and Mr. Joe Zasa?
{36852}{36955}- Just trouble. I'll take care of it.|- That's foolish of you.
{36967}{37092}Foolish of me? It's a little foolish|of this guy, don't you think? Right?
{37118}{37207}- Right?!|- Temper like his father...
{37212}{37267}Vincent...
{37291}{37418}Mr. Joe Zasa now owns what used to|be the Corleone business in New York.
{37423}{37518}Out of kindness, he gave you|a job in his family.
{37523}{37593}You took it against my advice.
{37595}{37715}I offered you something better in the|legitimate world. You turned me down.
{37720}{37840}Now you both come to me with this bad|blood. What do you expect me to do?
{37885}{37936}- Am I a gangster?|- No...
{37938}{38044}That was Papa's neighborhood.|Zasa runs it like a disgrace!
{38046}{38135}- That's the past, Connie.|- I earned that territory.
{38137}{38231}The Commission gave it to me|and you approved.
{38233}{38267}Yes.
{38271}{38382}I came for the party, not to ask for help.|I could kill this bastard.
{38384}{38439}So kill him.
{38454}{38525}What does all this have to do with me?
{38528}{38653}Well, he goes behind your back,|saying "Fuck Michael Corleone".
{38657}{38717}Say it to his face, one time!
{38753}{38878}Mr. Corleone, all bastards are liars.|Shakespeare wrote poems about it.
{38883}{38971}What am I going to do with this guy?!
{39103}{39216}Joey, if there's some guy|running around this city,
{39221}{39278}saying "Fuck Michael Corleone"...
{39317}{39415}...what do we do|with a piece of shit like that?
{39449}{39520}He's a fucking dog.
{39672}{39753}Yes, it's true. If anyone would say|such a thing,
{39758}{39844}they would not be a friend,|they would be a dog.
{39988}{40129}- My interests don't conflict with his.|- You don't know how much they do.
{40132}{40173}Quiet, Vincent.
{40177}{40228}He needs your support!
{40233}{40321}Don't let me work for this guy,|let me work for you.
{40326}{40470}As what? Tough guy? I don't need|tough guys. I need more lawyers.
{40523}{40674}Since we have no conflicts or debts,|I accept your tribute. I wish you well.
{40714}{40827}Vincent, make your peace|with Mr. Joe Zasa. Go on.
{41081}{41136}Bastardo...
{41259}{41328}Vinnie, what's the matter with you?!
{41333}{41386}Get him out of here.
{41419}{41470}Jesus Christ...
{41494}{41570}- I told Connie this wasn't the right time.|- Close it.
{41573}{41664}I know you're into Wall Street,|but you're still the final word.
{41666}{41736}I want to protect you from these guys.|Your lawyers can't.
{41741}{41827}- But you can?|- Yeah, I can do that.
{41841}{41892}Why should I be afraid of Zasa?
{41894}{41966}You stop him from rising|in the Commission.
{41971}{42050}I say we make him dead.|Give me the order, I'll do it.
{42055}{42105}- You'll do it?|- Yeah.
{42203}{42323}Maybe you should come with me|for a few weeks. See what happens.
{42328}{42402}- Okay.|- See if you learn.
{42422}{42506}And we'll talk about your future.
{42522}{42582}I won't let you down.
{42726}{42784}It's about ready.
{42918}{42951}What happened?
{42956}{43047}If I'm in a room with Zasa,|what happens? I bit his ear off.
{43052}{43124}Here we go. Watch the card.
{43182}{43215}Hold it!
{43270}{43314}- Vincent...|- Yeah.
{43318}{43378}Take the picture with us.
{43546}{43601}Nice jacket.
{43630}{43697}Closer to the centre, sir.
{43764}{43807}Smile!
{44270}{44397}Godfather, this is the cake for you|and your family from Enzo the baker.
{44412}{44469}Do you want to do it?
{45565}{45634}Cent'anni! Cent'anni!
{47066}{47147}- Vincent?|- What do you want, sweetheart?
{47193}{47250}Do you love me?
{47270}{47375}- Come on, go to bed.|- Come on, say it.
{47377}{47433}I love you.
{47437}{47502}I love you, too.
{47543}{47596}You've got a cat?
{47747}{47826}Go get us some water, I'm thirsty.|Come on.
{47840}{47891}Come on.
{48049}{48130}Well, I guess I know my place.
{48145}{48229}I can't believe I'm actually doing this.
{48233}{48334}"Get me water, bake me a cake"...|What happened to "please"?
{49478}{49547}Good boy, Sackface. Go for a walk.
{49751}{49830}- Let her go.|- Cut her throat, man.
{49885}{49965}- What did you say?|- Cut her fucking throat.
{50034}{50113}- Okay, chief...|- Drop your gun or he'll cut her throat.
{50118}{50207}I hardly know her, so cut her.|What the fuck do I care?
{50259}{50351}You've got no choice. She'll be dead.
{50353}{50454}If you do, I'll kill you both.|Give up that knife, I'll let you go.
{50458}{50514}Cut her throat! Right now!
{50542}{50657}I'll do something that'll convince you.|Don't get frightened. Just watch me.
{50780}{50816}Oh, shit!
{50866}{50924}Drop the knife. Drop it!
{50928}{51072}Good boy. Sit down, I want to talk|to you. It was a wise choice. Sit down.
{51091}{51142}Lose the mask.
{51209}{51290}Relax, have a smoke. You smoke?
{51331}{51405}Whose idea was this? Who sent you?
{51415}{51480}Tell me who sent you.
{51533}{51597}- No one.|- Did you take a look at this guy?
{51602}{51660}- Yeah.|- Who sent you?
{51722}{51780}It was Joey Zasa.
{52125}{52187}Are you okay?
{52242}{52317}- You were going to let them kill me!|- No, I wasn't...
{52321}{52401}You pig! You sick fuck!
{52429}{52530}You wanted gambling. That's gambling.|Call the police.
{52635}{52731}- You killed the other guy too?|- He went for my gun.
{52736}{52822}It was self-defence.|Go ahead, call the police.
{52842}{52892}- No, no...|- I'm taking pictures.
{52897}{52952}No pictures.
{52981}{53014}You had a gun!
{53019}{53141}They only had a knife. You could have|handed them over to the police.
{53144}{53240}Zasa sent them.|I just sent him a message.
{53256}{53381}- Now he has to send you one back.|- Is Zasa going to send me one back?
{53384}{53453}He did the right thing.|He got Zasa's name!
{53458}{53583}What has Joey Zasa to do|with anything? Joey Zasa is a pazzo.
{53633}{53702}All right. You are what you are.
{53710}{53782}It's your nature. Stay close to me.
{53786}{53877}Don't do anything. Keep your mouth|shut and your eyes open.
{53882}{53957}- And you do what I tell you.|- I understand.
{53961}{54055}- I have problems with the Commission.|- I know.
{54060}{54175}- You don't make them easier.|- It wasn't my idea that this happened.
{54180}{54249}- Get out of here.|- Michael...
{54254}{54302}Yes?
{54314}{54429}- Now they'll fear you.|- Maybe they should fear you.
{54503}{54594}- B.J., what's up?|- The Archbishop just called back.
{54599}{54671}We've arranged some amazing things.
{54676}{54793}The publicity is phenomenal. You're the|new Rockefeller. A philanthropist.
{54822}{54913}- Sign here, please.|- Times do change, don't they?
{54918}{55043}My father hated foundations.|He loved doing it by himself.
{55055}{55122}Man to man. But we're different.
{55127}{55244}No different than any large corporation.|We control a lot of money with little.
{55249}{55364}Minimise taxes.|With no government control.
{55575}{55656}- Godfather.|- Andrew.
{55695}{55808}- Off to Rome...|- I wanted to thank you for everything.
{55810}{55887}- Do you want some breakfast?|- Thanks, I can't.
{55889}{55985}- How's your Italian?|- Devo fare un po' di pratica.
{56014}{56071}- His father was a great lawyer.|- I know.
{56076}{56189}Didn't live to see him ordained. I did.|Did you ever see one of those?
{56191}{56277}Beautiful. I was so proud.|Let me walk you out.
{56306}{56381}If you hear any rumours in the Vatican,|let me know.
{56385}{56452}No, Andrew has the true faith.
{56666}{56711}Don Corleone,
{56716}{56827}I need your help. And not just|to light a little candle.
{56855}{57023}My gift was to be able to persuade|people to give to the Holy Church.
{57040}{57160}Then Rome decides to put me|in charge of the Vatican Bank...
{57203}{57277}...but I was never a true banker.
{57347}{57455}Mea culpa. I trusted my friends.
{57479}{57536}Friendship and money...
{57555}{57599}Oil and water...
{57603}{57642}Indeed.
{57647}{57814}But these "friends" used the good name|of the Church to feed their greed.
{57838}{57903}If money was lost...
{57927}{57992}...then I am to blame.
{58006}{58148}If only prayer could pay off|our 700 million dollar deficit.
{58188}{58253}769 million...
{58387}{58512}The Church owns 25 percent|of a large corporation: immobiliare.
{58534}{58584}You know the one I mean?
{58589}{58713}Largest landlord on Earth.|Real estate worth six billion dollars.
{58754}{58802}That's true.
{58807}{58908}And the Vatican vote|is necessary for control.
{58968}{59040}No, you're mistaken.
{59044}{59150}This isn't a question of one person|deciding, one deciding vote.
{59152}{59296}This is like any other company.|We have directors and very old rules.
{59315}{59433}The Pope himself|would have to approve you.
{59529}{59584}We've sold the casinos.
{59622}{59716}All businesses having to do|with gambling.
{59720}{59860}We have no interests or investments|in anything illegitimate.
{59927}{60044}The Corleones are prepared to deposit|500 million dollars in the Vatican Bank
{60049}{60123}when Mr. Corleone receives|majority control of immobiliare.
{60128}{60260}Immobiliare could be something new.|A European conglomerate.
{60286}{60389}Few families have control|of such a company.
{60464}{60531}It seems that, in today's world,
{60536}{60660}the power to absolve debt is greater|than the power of forgiveness.
{60689}{60742}600 million dollars.
{60857}{60950}Don't overestimate|the power of forgiveness.
{60984}{61032}Don Corleone,
{61037}{61157}this deal with immobiliare can make you|one of the richest men in the world.
{61161}{61293}Your whole past history, and the history|of your family, would be washed away.
{61387}{61447}600 million.
{61811}{61931}The motion under discussion|relates to Corleone Group's proposal
{61933}{62070}to acquire 100,000,000 newly-issued|Class A voting shares.
{62106}{62269}... Corleone capital invested directly|into international immobiliare,
{62274}{62367}an old and respected|European company.
{62372}{62499}Mr. Corleone has an ambitious programme|to expand this real estate company
{62504}{62576}into an international conglomerate...
{62660}{62780}...by Eastern techniques of efficiency|and focus and unlimited...
{62782}{62854}Mr. Corleone, excuse me.
{62859}{62948}Didn't you recently deposit 200 million|in the Vatican Bank,
{62952}{63022}which is affiliated with immobiliare?
{63027}{63063}True. Why not?
{63068}{63197}Wasn't there any questioning about|the timing on this particular deposit?
{63216}{63279}Mr. Chairman, if I may?
{63310}{63422}The Vito Andolini Corleone Foundation,|of which Mary Corleone is chairman,
{63427}{63506}has made an endowment|of 1 00 million dollars.
{63511}{63612}The money comes from his own family|and will be administered by the Vatican.
{63617}{63679}Does that answer your question?
{63684}{63837}I have always believed that helping your|fellow man is profitable in every sense,
{63840}{63902}personally and bottom line.
{63909}{64043}My fellow shareholders, if Europe|and America can learn to co-operate,
{64048}{64146}if we can learn to pool our wealth,|share our markets,
{64149}{64271}we can defeat any competition|anywhere in the world.
{64286}{64350}Thank you for your time.
{64353}{64465}I hope that you will look favourably|on my proposal. Thank you.
{64597}{64672}Let me have this microphone here.
{64674}{64803}Will we let a criminal run our company?|He's got the map of Sicily on his face!
{64806}{64844}Order!
{64847}{64921}He's either a Catholic or a mafioso...
{64959}{65074}The Hamilton investors Group|cannot support this proposal.
{65086}{65120}Your Excellency...
{65146}{65182}Mr. Chairman...
{65201}{65352}...the Vatican Bank feels|that international immobiliare...
{65398}{65496}...will be safe in Mr. Corleone's hands.
{65501}{65621}...subject to audit and final ratification,|which must take place in Rome.
{65626}{65719}Please join me in welcoming|Mr. Michael Corleone.
{65959}{66002}Dad?
{66057}{66148}Tony says that I'm a front|for the foundation.
{66177}{66266}That you're using me to pull the strings.
{66271}{66345}- To get the money where you want it.|- Please!
{66350}{66427}- To shine up your public image.|- Mary!
{66443}{66544}Mary, this is real.|This foundation is real.
{66602}{66722}I wanted Anthony to be part of it.|I thought you would be together on this.
{66726}{66832}I won't interfere.|I'll help, but only if you ask.
{66837}{66899}What is this really for?
{66904}{67019}Why are you doing this?|Why am I doing this?
{67024}{67146}I'm doing this for my children.|You're doing it for your children too.
{67155}{67232}This foundation is supposed to|help all people?
{67237}{67275}That's the purpose.
{67295}{67410}This is legitimate.|Mary, I swear, this is legitimate.
{67508}{67592}Dad, I want this to bring me|closer to you.
{67776}{67882}I would burn in Hell to keep you safe.
{68210}{68280}Go in the other car. I'll ride with Michael.
{68285}{68335}Go, go, go.
{68661}{68807}As your family's oldest friend, I'm|always chosen to bring you messages.
{68860}{68935}Tell me, Don Altobello.
{68973}{69074}Your old partners are grateful for|the money you made them.
{69076}{69134}They worship you...
{69157}{69306}...but their hearts are broken, because|they think you abandoned them.
{69316}{69464}They want to share your deal|on immobiliare, to be a family again.
{69474}{69539}It can purify their money.
{69587}{69649}This I cannot do.
{69695}{69788}Immobiliare must be legitimate.
{69817}{69877}I know.
{69882}{69944}But they're unhappy.
{69982}{70028}And you?
{70033}{70179}I ask nothing for myself,|only peace in my old age.
{70184}{70272}But I must please the world around me.
{70299}{70455}Michael, your father was a|reasonable man. Learn from him.
{70505}{70594}I learned many things from my father.
{70716}{70855}Call a meeting, my friend,|so there are no debts or grudges.
{70884}{70960}We will make the peace, you and l.
{71152}{71200}The Vatican announced today...
{71205}{71308}that Pope Paul VI has canceled|his Sunday blessing...
{71313}{71366}due to ill health.
{71370}{71507}His physician has ordered|total bed rest...
{71512}{71579}and cessation of all activities.
{71908}{72042}They've had a press conference. The|Pope's condition is grave. "Gravissimo. "
{72687}{72814}The purpose of this meeting|is to ratify...
{72819}{72917}the motion passed by our|shareholders in New York.
{72936}{72986}Please...
{72989}{73102}Our group represents a consortium|of Catholic businessmen
{73106}{73181}against the Corleone control.
{73193}{73313}The Vatican has cast its vote. Corleone|Group already controls the Board.
{73320}{73432}According to the Lateran Treaty,|the Vatican vote must be ratified here.
{73437}{73502}Here in Rome, by the Pope.
{73583}{73670}The Pope is gravely ill.
{73694}{73794}Until he recovers, I am powerless.
{73809}{73881}- What if he dies?|- Then...
{73902}{73981}...as you Americans say,|all bets are off.
{73984}{74049}Gentlemen, please.
{74068}{74171}This is a brief delay. Nothing more.
{74267}{74346}Your Excellency, gentlemen...
{74358}{74495}I advise you to join us in our prayers|for the Holy Father's recovery.
{74521}{74562}We had an agreement!
{74593}{74686}This meeting was to be|merely a formality.
{74689}{74813}- Please sit down.|- I'd rather stand. Give me an answer.
{74816}{74950}The immobiliare has its roots in the|European tradition. Please understand.
{74965}{75048}I understand.|Your tactics are despicable.
{75051}{75128}That's quite an indictment,|coming from a Corleone.
{75130}{75257}- Gentlemen, gentlemen!|- Remember you are in the Vatican.
{75322}{75468}- What is it that you want?|- Yes, you will take control.
{75482}{75581}We'll gladly put you at the helm|of our little fleet,
{75586}{75684}but our ships must all sail|in the same direction.
{75715}{75861}Otherwise, who can say how long|your stay with us will last?
{75902}{76060}It's not personal. It's only business.|You should know, Godfather.
{76139}{76175}Very well.
{76204}{76324}You want to do business with me?|I will do business with you.
{76348}{76415}Vipers, all of them.
{76540}{76614}- We're back with the Borgias!|- Uncle Michael...
{76619}{76691}- Andrew!|- I heard you were here.
{76696}{76801}It's so nice to see you.|Vincent, it's so nice.
{76806}{76880}What is this about the Borgias?|Those days are over.
{77014}{77084}- Recognise it?|- Yeah.
{77103}{77221}Genco Olive Oil. That's where our|grandfather started as a delivery boy.
{77225}{77295}Three years later he owned it.
{77307}{77381}- Only in America.|- That's it.
{77386}{77511}Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?|We need your help so badly.
{77513}{77614}- What can I do for you?|- Get rid of Joe Zasa. He sells drugs...
{77619}{77727}Now that I'm an older woman,|I'm afraid to go out at night.
{77729}{77784}Where should they be now?
{77789}{77863}- Lou, what's going on?|- We're late.
{77906}{77969}- Have I ever let you down?|- I trust you.
{77974}{78031}- Don't worry.|- Thank you.
{78036}{78079}Enjoy yourselves.
{78232}{78340}- What was that?|- The neighbourhood's in trouble.
{78350}{78417}- Do you keep an eye out for them?|- Yes.
{78419}{78491}- And for me?|- From now on.
{78513}{78609}- I've missed you all this time.|- I missed you too, cousin.
{78611}{78738}I missed growing up with my cousins.|I didn't even know you, but missed you.
{78753}{78861}Do you remember stories|about our fathers? The old days?
{78863}{78940}Yeah, what do you want to know?
{78978}{79120}- What was Sonny like?|- Well, he was the Prince of the City.
{79144}{79237}He died before I was born,|but I've heard a lot about him.
{79275}{79364}- What about my father?|- He's a great man.
{79395}{79462}He's a hero. He saved the family.
{79494}{79544}- Vincent?|- What?
{79546}{79609}Did he kill his own brother?
{79707}{79753}No.
{79801}{79860}So, it's all lies?
{79937}{80028}Just stories, sweetheart. Okay?
{80117}{80160}Okay.
{80191}{80249}I believe you.
{80251}{80350}- I'm glad you're around.|- I'm glad you're here too.
{80457}{80508}Cugina...
{80513}{80563}Cous...
{80894}{80973}I'd like to take Joey Zasa for a ride|in this and drop him.
{80978}{81045}Joey Zasa is nothing.
{81047}{81141}He's a small-time enforcer.|He bluffs and threatens.
{81146}{81241}He's nothing. You can see him coming|a mile away.
{81258}{81333}- We should kill him before he...|- No!
{81393}{81508}Never hate your enemies.|It affects your judgement.
{81884}{81949}Nice to see you again, Mr. Corleone.
{82440}{82507}Hey, girls. Let's go.
{82917}{83025}We trusted you to manage|our money in the casinos.
{83030}{83169}It's not even 20 years. You've sold the|casinos and made fortunes for all of us.
{83174}{83232}Bravo, Don Corleone!
{83275}{83308}Thank you.
{83330}{83505}Friends, I have come here|because our business together is done.
{83534}{83574}We have prospered,
{83579}{83723}and now it is time for us to dissolve|the business relationship between us.
{83754}{83802}That's it.
{83807}{83891}But I do have a little surprise. Al?
{83948}{84011}Your shares in the casinos.
{84016}{84114}I've cut the red tape, so you could|get your money right away.
{84274}{84330}50 million dollars!
{84334}{84416}- Not everybody gets the same.|- Nothing for you...
{84421}{84562}- It depends on your investment.|- Michael, this is really generous!
{84565}{84598}Wonderful!
{84670}{84800}- Parisi, how much did you invest?|- I don't remember.
{84802}{84852}You're blessed.
{84963}{85092}My family has done much of|the hard work, taken many risks.
{85130}{85202}All to make money|for the rest of the families.
{85262}{85322}You all know Joey Zasa.
{85329}{85406}He is, I admit, an important man.
{85418}{85521}His picture is on the cover|of the New York Times magazine.
{85526}{85641}He gets the Esquire Magazine award|for the best-dressed gangster.
{85644}{85691}The newspapers praise him
{85696}{85804}because he hires Blacks,|which shows he has a good heart.
{85867}{85922}He is famous.
{85926}{86070}Who knows? Maybe one day|he'll make all of you popular.
{86111}{86145}It's true.
{86147}{86279}I make more of a bella figura.|That is my nature.
{86284}{86401}But I also want to make a move|into legitimate enterprises.
{86404}{86471}I'd like a little pin from the Pope.
{86480}{86603}Sure, I take the Blacks and the Spanish|into my family,
{86607}{86686}because that's America.
{86703}{86802}And you guarantee|that they don't deal drugs?
{86823}{86955}I don't guarantee that. I guarantee|that I'll kill anybody who does.
{87046}{87173}- Let me talk to him.|- Who can refuse Don Altobello?
{87183}{87252}- Joey, are you...|- No!
{87257}{87394}I say to all of you: I have been|treated this day with no respect.
{87415}{87540}I've earned you all money. I've made|you rich and I asked for little.
{87545}{87653}Good. You will not give, so I'll take!
{87674}{87737}As for Don Corleone,
{87741}{87888}he makes it very clear to me today|that he is my enemy.
{87972}{88041}You must choose between us.
{88139}{88178}No, Joey!
{88204}{88276}Michael, we could reason together.
{88281}{88319}No.
{88348}{88454}Michael, please... Let's agree.
{88456}{88513}He doesn't know what he's...
{88518}{88564}No, no.
{88662}{88746}Michael, the news is everywhere.
{88765}{88854}Everyone says that you|control immobiliare.
{88859}{88991}Immobiliare is already laundering|money in Peru and Nassau.
{89012}{89127}We've worked with you for 40 years.|We should wet our beaks a little.
{89130}{89257}- We want to do business with you.|- That's right, we've been together...
{89475}{89559}- It's a hit! Let's go!|- Let's get out of here! Move!
{90017}{90086}My coat! It's my lucky coat!
{90113}{90161}It's my lucky coat!
{90302}{90364}Stay behind me!
{90726}{90772}Mikey, this way!
{90976}{91050}Zasa, you son-of-a-bitch...
{91544}{91609}Come on. We're out of here.
{92371}{92434}- You did good, Vincent.|- Grazie.
{92436}{92520}The old Dons were pretty much|wiped out.
{92525}{92594}The survivors made deals with Zasa.
{92623}{92683}- Altobello?|- He survived.
{92688}{92815}He's with his daughters in Staten Island.|He says he's going to retire in Sicily.
{92848}{92971}Joey Zasa would never pull something|like this without the backing.
{92973}{93110}He's just muscle. He doesn't have|the wit for that helicopter attack.
{93115}{93220}He doesn't even have the ambition|to wipe out the whole Commission.
{93225}{93294}I say we hit back and take Zasa out!
{93421}{93496}Never let anyone know|what you're thinking.
{93688}{93762}Let's get a message to Joey Zasa.
{93836}{93906}I respect what he's done.
{93918}{93994}The new overthrows the old. It's natural.
{93999}{94090}How can you do business|with this guy?
{94119}{94217}I'm a businessman, first and foremost.|I want no further conflict.
{94222}{94342}- Tell him that he can live or he can die.|- Vincent, will you shut up!
{94771}{94819}That's it.
{94862}{94908}Joey Zasa...
{94913}{94980}He can't be doing this alone.
{95057}{95176}Just when I thought I was out,|they pull me back in.
{95361}{95500}Our true enemy has not yet|shown his face.
{95606}{95649}Michael!
{95805}{95903}- Has he had his medicine?|- I don't know what he took.
{95958}{96054}- I've got my wind back.|- Call a doctor.
{96059}{96126}- Run, run, run!|- Vincent!
{96131}{96183}Run at thunder, girl! Thunder can't hurt!
{96224}{96284}Harmless noise!
{96289}{96404}Bullshit! You deceitful old fuck!
{96421}{96481}Altobello, you fuck!
{96553}{96598}Fredo!
{96608}{96644}Fredo!
{97207}{97282}Oh, God! Dad!
{97330}{97382}Excuse me.
{97387}{97435}I'll call Kay.
{97680}{97780}- Good evening, sir.|- Can we wait here? We'll be back soon.
{97931}{98090}Mr. Harrison, you said it was urgent.|Have you come to confess your sins?
{98094}{98217}Michael Corleone has had a diabetic|stroke. I wanted you to know about it.
{98221}{98337}He's in a coma. I'm here to insist|the deal goes through in any event.
{98341}{98392}The Pope has not much time left.
{98428}{98526}So, as you, I am in a difficult position.
{98528}{98624}We have to ratify this deal|as soon as possible.
{98629}{98703}- We have an understanding.|- Good.
{98727}{98828}- I'm going to the hospital.|- I'll pray for Mr. Corleone.
{98926}{99027}- Our thoughts are with Mr. Corleone.|- Thank you, Father Jim.
{99085}{99190}Everything would be out in the open|if Corleone dies.
{99207}{99260}Play for time, Keinszig.
{99276}{99394}A habit born of a long contemplation|of eternity.
{99545}{99643}- Forget about it, Vinnie.|- Why? It's a simple hit.
{99648}{99789}I'd love to smack Joey Zasa and then|whack the fag. But it's impossible.
{99794}{99926}He's always with people, in front of TV|cameras in his own neighborhood.
{99929}{100015}- It's not impossible. It'll work for us.|- How?
{100020}{100135}Do you think he's going to let|Uncle Michael survive? Would you?
{100140}{100209}He may not survive anyway.
{100221}{100315}- How would you do it?|- I'd do it myself.
{100351}{100403}Do it!
{100442}{100514}- What would you need?|- A couple of guys.
{101250}{101307}Hello, Michael.
{101365}{101415}It's Kay.
{101521}{101561}Kay...
{101612}{101672}I never expected you.
{101681}{101736}No, I know.
{101792}{101837}But I'm here.
{101926}{101988}- I'm glad.|- You know...
{102058}{102122}I've never seen you looking so helpless.
{102228}{102293}It's not so bad, really.
{102324}{102432}I feel... I'm getting wiser now.
{102436}{102494}- Yeah.|- Oh, yeah.
{102511}{102652}- The sicker you get, the wiser you get?|- When I'm dead, I'll be really smart.
{102683}{102794}Michael... I want to thank you for Tony.
{102861}{102966}He's doing really well.|He's gotten some very good notices,
{102969}{103105}and he'll make his operatic debut|in Sicily, in Palermo this Easter, so...
{103141}{103182}So, thank you.
{103209}{103297}That's a real honour. In Sicily.
{103408}{103487}I will be there. I won't miss that.
{103501}{103547}I won't miss that.
{103690}{103753}Mary, Tony...
{103782}{103837}Go see Dad.
{103959}{104045}- Sweetheart!|- Everything's going to be all right.
{104055}{104132}- Tony!|- How are you doing, Pop?
{104182}{104261}Your mother told me what happened.
{104266}{104407}- About Palermo? I hope you'll be there.|- Of course. Kiss me.
{104875}{105012}- Cousin Vinnie?|- He's not here. Call his apartment.
{105016}{105103}- It's your cousin Mary.|- Let her in.
{105196}{105294}Hi, cous. I thought I'd drop by.|Is that okay?
{105299}{105364}I'll get the guys.
{105388}{105477}No, it's not okay.|You shouldn't have come, Mary.
{105501}{105561}Only a couple of minutes, okay?
{105592}{105673}- You look beautiful, cous.|- Thanks.
{105733}{105815}So this is your club, your hideout?
{105820}{105896}- Yeah.|- I came here to check it out.
{105999}{106098}It's so strange, just me|and Aunt Connie in the house.
{106102}{106215}- I feel better when I'm with you.|- What's wrong, sweetheart?
{106220}{106285}- I'm scared about my father.|- Don't be.
{106287}{106395}When they took him out of|the ambulance, I thought he was dead.
{106400}{106474}Everybody says he's going to be better.
{106496}{106544}Don't worry.
{106548}{106618}I remember a shooting when I was little.
{106647}{106767}And one time Al Neri and other|bodyguards took me and Tony away.
{106803}{106877}Is it all happening again?
{106889}{106951}Not like that, sweetie.
{106980}{107093}Then why are you hiding here?|Is something going to happen to you?
{107114}{107232}Nothing's going to happen|to me, cugina. We'll take care of you.
{107481}{107591}- Can I stay here and hide out with you?|- Can you help me cook for the boys?
{107594}{107694}You know that I don't know|how to cook, but I'll help.
{107992}{108042}Okay...
{108047}{108095}What do I do?
{108860}{108946}- I love you, cous.|- I love you, too, cous.
{109023}{109080}Let us cook.
{109464}{109514}Hold me.
{110382}{110495}You in the press and the police|use words like "Mafia", "Cosa Nostra".
{110497}{110629}This is a fantasy. We Italian-Americans|laid the bricks that built this city.
{110634}{110694}We have Meucci,|who invented the telephone.
{110699}{110787}We have Don Ameche,|who played the guy who invented it.
{110792}{110888}Buy yourself a raffle ticket,|maybe you'll win a Cadillac.
{110919}{110979}The salsiccia is wonderful!
{110984}{111037}Here, have a sandwich.
{111344}{111440}- Nice to see you, Mr. Zasa.|- Have a nice time.
{111461}{111538}Don't forget to buy your raffle tickets.
{111593}{111675}- What are you doing?|- He didn't mean it.
{111679}{111761}- Tell him you're sorry.|- Okay, let's go.
{112200}{112262}Joey! How are you?
{112281}{112348}How are you, Buddy boy?
{112353}{112442}Hey, Joey Zasa! Joey, up your ass!
{112473}{112540}- Who is this? Do you know him?|- Ignore him.
{112545}{112636}Who's going to win the car? The Ant?
{112672}{112777}This is what gives Italian-Americans|a bad name. A cappone like this.
{112782}{112837}Joey, up your ass!
{112842}{112912}Get off the car!|Do you have a raffle ticket?
{112931}{113010}Joey, take a look at my raffle ticket!
{113036}{113120}Here's what I think of you...|and your raffle ticket.
{113123}{113211}Get the fuck off this car.|I'll break your fucking balls.
{113274}{113338}Get out of here!
{113708}{113789}Run, Joey! You piece of shit!
{114075}{114108}Open the door!
{114122}{114190}How are you, Joe?
{114242}{114276}Zasa!
{114696}{114863}Don't ever again give that kind of order.|Not while I'm alive.
{114873}{114916}Understand?
{114945}{115094}You were too sick to make a decision.|I got a go-ahead from Neri and Connie.
{115113}{115158}Connie?
{115381}{115460}It was the right decision, Uncle Mike.
{115463}{115554}It was the wrong decision.|I command this family!
{115568}{115621}Right or wrong...
{115638}{115710}...it was not what I wanted!
{116151}{116196}Do you understand?
{116355}{116388}Yes.
{116549}{116590}Come on, Michael.
{116870}{116916}Yes.
{116952}{117096}Good. Vincent, help me to my bed.|I want to talk to you alone for a minute.
{117290}{117405}You know, I always felt|responsible for you.
{117410}{117460}You know that.
{117467}{117510}Your father...
{117534}{117616}...my brother, we were opposites.
{117621}{117743}We would fight and argue.|But I never doubted his love.
{117748}{117863}He would do anything for me.|But his temper...
{117942}{118045}Too much. It clouded his reason.
{118071}{118153}I don't want you to make that mistake.
{118203}{118258}Also...
{118263}{118337}...he, too, had a way with women.
{118369}{118431}- Vincent...|- So I hear.
{118433}{118493}What are you doing with my daughter?
{118556}{118632}What are you doing with her?
{118719}{118776}It's too dangerous.
{118839}{118887}Do you hear me?
{119023}{119071}Okay.
{119402}{119455}Vincenzo...
{119536}{119656}When they come,|they'll come at what you love.
{119836}{119915}Michael, you must lead another life.
{119918}{120049}You have everything a man could|desire. It's time for you to retire.
{120066}{120138}I have too much responsibility.
{120155}{120289}Immobiliare? It's too difficult now.|You should really get out.
{120296}{120416}What do you know|about those pezzi da novanta in Italy?
{120500}{120594}I'm too old to know anything|about those new people.
{120598}{120711}I must accept my age|and grow my olives and tomatoes.
{120738}{120843}- We're not that old.|- But you're very ill.
{120855}{120970}Michael... Let me see|what can be done.
{120975}{121080}Let me work to make your path|a little easier.
{121083}{121217}- Your friendship does that always.|- That makes me happy.
{121222}{121323}Joey Zasa... You were wrong|about him.
{121347}{121440}I trust too much.|That's always been my fault.
{121620}{121716}Michael... treachery is everywhere.
{121721}{121826}You still have your fingers|on the strings, even now.
{121850}{121924}Let's see more of each other.
{121929}{122039}- Michael, in Sicily?|- In Sicily.
{122051}{122102}In Sicilia.
{122109}{122171}In Sicilia.
