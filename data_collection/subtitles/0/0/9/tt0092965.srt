1
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,342
They cut the bloody rations!

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,640
-Don't worry. I'll get yours.
-You're just like your father.

3
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,607
They cut our rations in half!

4
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,319
I'll get ours. You sit down.

5
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:34,826
You cut the bloody rations!
You cut them!

6
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,530
I've got yours, Mr. Maxton.

7
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,162
I've got some! I've got some!

8
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,331
Hello, everybody.

9
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:55,157
-Sit there.
-Eat it up, please.

10
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:02,414
The rations have been cut.
They're like animals.

11
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:06,710
82, 83, 84....

12
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,132
87 weevils today, Mr. Victor.

13
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:18,222
That's above average,
but the trend is down.

14
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:32,069
-Must you, Jim?
-Sorry.

15
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,074
Some of us will die just before we're
saved, so use everything.

16
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:41,328
-You'll miss this camp after the war.
-Will I?

17
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,707
I'll locate my parents when the people
in the camps come out.

18
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:50,838
-I'll tell my dad you looked after me.
-Think I'll get the reward?

19
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:55,425
-What reward?
-You told everyone.

20
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,095
I was much younger then.

21
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,557
Why'd the Japanese close the school?

22
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,143
To punish the grownups.

23
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,899
I wonder how you'll take to school
in England.

24
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,819
It might be a bit strange.

25
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,823
The best teacher's the university
of life.

26
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,907
For heaven's--

27
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:24,454
Could we finish our meal? We know your
views on the university of life.

28
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:30,627
-We should eat the weevils.
-I know. Dr. Rawlins told you.

29
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:35,132
-He said we need the protein.
-Yes, he's right.

30
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,801
We should eat all the weevils.

31
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,180
Do you believe in vitamins?

32
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,808
Strange child.

33
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:53,525
Perhaps it's time you moved into
the men's dormitory.

34
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,903
You're not 1 2 anymore.

35
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,700
The Americans are over Nantao again.

36
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,256
They're bombing the Shanghai docks!

37
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,440
Coney lsland pilots.

38
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:41,109
-What was that?
-A 29 going down.

39
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,445
-A 200-pounder.
-That was close.

40
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:46,615
-Too close for Nagata.
-He won't go like that.

41
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,423
What's happening, doctor?

42
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:07,469
Reprisals, and damned silly it is too.

43
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:15,102
-Keep the patients from the windows.
-Yes, doctor.

44
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:07,649
Get away! This is British food!
Leave it alone!

45
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,860
This is our food. Get away!

46
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,989
Guards!

47
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:30,714
Mines. That was a mine. I told you.

48
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,259
Somebody lobbed a grenade.

49
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,116
Say, Basie, I bet he hits a mine.

50
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:02,287
I bet you there are no mines.
You can walk right through.

51
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,622
You got a bet.

52
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,622
So far so good.

53
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,764
He's seen something.

54
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,892
Jim's a black cat.

55
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:17,399
That's a dead boy, Basie.
I'll give you odds.

56
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,318
My harmonica...

57
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,572
...and my next meal
against your wristwatch.

58
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,659
You're on, my friend.

59
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,012
I double my bet. My next two meals.

60
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:51,475
-You'll lose a lot of weight.
-What else you betting?

61
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,644
-My Life.
-Who's on the cover?

62
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:05,322
-Two cigarettes on the kid!
-Sunglasses on Nagata!

63
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,626
Keep going, sarge!

64
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:11,221
-The lucky kid.
-Cleaned me out.

65
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:52,638
-Hello, Jim.
-Hello, Nina.

66
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,307
-Would you like a Hershey bar?
-Yes.

67
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:58,143
So would I, kid. You got one?

68
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:24,980
Don't let me down, kid.
You're an American now.

69
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,909
How you doing, Frank?

70
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:40,264
The river's east. You can go
up the bank or up the middle...

71
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:44,309
...or go north of east,
but you gotta go across canals.

72
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,229
It doesn't say if it's
buildings or what.

73
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,398
Where'd you get a map?

74
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,528
It's a cork and needle?

75
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:58,490
-A compass that actually works.
-Put it down.

76
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:01,326
-ls it time?
-No, I'll tell you when.

77
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:04,163
-You won't forget?
-Fat chance.

78
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:08,792
-I almost feel human.
-Without me, you'd have no compass.

79
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:12,171
No, without you
I wouldn't have the needle.

80
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,673
The best way is across the river.

81
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,468
Jim, the curtain.

82
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,632
Jim, come here.

83
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,429
You're in charge of my stuff.

84
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,352
You see this mosquito net?

85
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,648
See?

86
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:19,983
What does that tell you?

87
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:28,325
Rawlins is on the take.

88
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:34,039
-You're so clever, Basie.
-Yeah.

89
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:38,168
Only cost me two batteries.

90
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,421
How are you feeling?

91
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:43,423
I've had worse.

92
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:46,176
I was beaten by a stoker once.

93
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,595
Were you a stoker?

94
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:53,100
Ship's steward. Shanghai-Frisco line.

95
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:56,019
Why did he beat you?

96
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:04,903
Shanghai-Frisco will be
the trip now. Huh, Jim?

97
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:09,533
Basie, where do you live?

98
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:10,993
Here.

99
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,912
No, I mean after the war.

100
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:15,914
Somewhere else.

101
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:25,757
Until you find a place,
you could live at Amherst Avenue.

102
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:33,265
I'd like you to come
and meet my parents.

103
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:38,604
We could fill up the pool...

104
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:42,274
...and we'll eat three times a day.

105
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:48,322
You're not feeling
sorry for me, are you?

106
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,493
-No one feels sorry for you, Basie.
-That's right.

107
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:57,498
-And you always eat first.
-You said it, kid.

108
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:02,169
I've been thinking about
going upriver.

109
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:04,046
I know.

110
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:07,132
Listen--

111
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:12,095
The plan is,
we're going to get a sampan.

112
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:17,476
Take it up the Yangtze estuary.
Rendezvous with some Hakka friends.

113
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:20,187
Are they proper pirates, you mean?

114
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:24,358
Let's just call them gentlemen
of fortune, shall we?

115
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,780
Did you ever see...

116
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:34,368
-...the Hell Drivers in Shanghai?
-Yes. On the news reels.

117
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:37,246
I saw them crash
through a burning wall.

118
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:41,500
That's what I'm going to call
our little outfit.

119
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,544
With 250 calibers...

120
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,214
...we are going to be
the lords of the Yangtze.

121
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:50,300
Actually, that may be a better name.

122
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:54,972
It's at the beginning and end of war
that we have to watch out.

123
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,684
In between, it's like a country club.

124
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:03,897
But you gotta know how to stay
balanced and make the right friends.

125
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:08,068
Because this war
is definitely winding down.

126
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:09,945
And after that?

127
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:12,072
After that...

128
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:16,618
...I retire in luxury,
start a barber college....

129
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:30,340
What are you doing here?

130
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:41,560
I told you to look out for my stuff.

131
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,942
They were bigger than me.

132
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:15,928
-Look who's here.
-Heard they had you under the net.

133
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:28,824
Stay with me, Johnny!

134
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:45,799
-Get everybody inside, quick!
-Stay away from the building!

135
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:50,429
Oh, God. Please, no!

136
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:53,098
My husband's in there.

137
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:59,039
Go! P-51 , Cadillac of the sky!

138
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:09,007
P-51 , Cadillac of the sky!

139
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:23,397
Jim, get off the roof!

140
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:29,987
Horsepower!

141
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,505
Get down, Jim. Go on, get down!

142
00:34:49,882 --> 00:34:53,051
P-51 ! Aren't they beautiful?

143
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:56,263
-Get down!
-I touched them!

144
00:34:56,471 --> 00:35:01,018
I felt their heat! I can taste them.
Oil and cordite.

145
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:03,270
Come back to the hospital.

146
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:06,773
Remember how we helped
to build the runway?

147
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:11,945
lf we died like the others,
our bones would be in the runway.

148
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:16,950
-In a way, it's our runway.
-No, it's their runway, Jim.

149
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,911
Try not to think so much.

150
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:22,122
Try not to think so much!

151
00:35:31,757 --> 00:35:34,968
I can't remember
what my parents look like.

152
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:43,810
I used to play bridge
with my mother in her bedroom.

153
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:49,441
She used to comb her hair.
I'd watch her.

154
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:53,570
She had dark hair.

155
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:54,418
What's happening? What's happening?

156
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:00,716
The guards are leaving!
They're taking us upcountry.

157
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:03,719
They're moving us to Nantao!
The Japanese say there's food there.

158
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:08,599
One suitcase! We leave in one hour!
One suitcase!

159
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:10,100
One suitcase!

160
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:13,145
They've got our rations at Nantao.

161
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,821
He's gone.

162
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:25,908
Him and Dainty.

163
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,079
He's gone?

164
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:34,416
He's escaped!

165
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:39,171
He can't have. He promised me!

166
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,429
He knew it was time.

167
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:52,226
-Where am I gonna go?
-We'll all have to leave now.

168
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:55,979
He knew it was time.

169
00:39:57,356 --> 00:39:59,066
He knew it was time.

170
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:18,669
Boy.

171
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:23,590
Difficult boy.

172
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:44,862
Just look...

173
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:49,283
...later here for escort!

174
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:45,125
Jim, where's my husband?
Where's Mr. Victor?

175
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:58,360
We are civilians. Listen to me.

176
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:02,823
I am a British doctor.
They are my responsibility!

177
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:18,547
No, we must have rest and food.

178
00:47:18,881 --> 00:47:21,550
We're going upcountry, Jim.

179
00:47:23,427 --> 00:47:25,137
Will there be food there?

180
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,765
There's none here.

181
00:47:33,896 --> 00:47:37,191
Mrs. Victor, we're going upcountry.

182
00:47:43,906 --> 00:47:45,699
Come on, Jim.

183
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:55,000
Don't go. It's better here.

184
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:03,258
You'll die here.

185
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:07,137
Don't worry, Mr. Maxton.

186
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:17,856
Pretend you're dead, Mrs. Victor.

187
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:15,432
Surrender reached the Japanese
in a broadcast by Hirohito.

188
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:20,062
He said Japan will endure the
unendurable and suffer greatly.

189
00:50:20,229 --> 00:50:25,275
The war minister and others
committed suicide outside the palace.

190
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:29,238
Japan is devastated,
destroyed in spirit. ..

191
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:32,241
...as Hiroshima and Nagasakihave
been destroyed.

192
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:35,744
More than 100,000 people
were killed in two...

193
00:50:35,953 --> 00:50:39,373
...single-bomb explosions, which
ended the Pacifiic War.

194
00:50:39,581 --> 00:50:42,543
The Russian declaration of war...

195
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:45,712
...has sent a million
soldiers into Manchuria.

196
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:50,759
Tokyo was hit with a dawn-to-dusk
raid by 1500 B-29 bombers.

197
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:54,596
But Japan's war was lost.
Her goal to create...

198
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:57,808
...a new empire incinerated
in a flash...

199
00:50:58,016 --> 00:51:00,143
...hotter than the sun.

200
00:51:00,352 --> 00:51:03,814
Everyone stands in awe of
the new super-weapon.

201
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:08,735
Only a few scientists knew the power
in splitting the uranium atom.

202
00:51:08,944 --> 00:51:11,572
It reached us in a shock wave...

203
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,867
...and a white light: the atom bomb.

204
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:16,952
Each of the two bombs...

205
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:20,622
...had the power of
20,000 tons of explosives.

206
00:51:20,831 --> 00:51:23,959
Nagasakiis
Japan's gateway to China...

207
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:27,254
...just 500 miles from Shanghai.

208
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:32,718
I saw that! I saw that! I saw that!

209
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:36,722
The white light.

210
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:42,060
I thought it was Mrs. Victor's
soul going to heaven.

211
00:55:43,552 --> 00:55:46,013
Bastard!

212
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,205
He gave me a mango.

213
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,875
I'll give you
a whole fruit salad!

214
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:18,545
There's Frigidaires
falling from the sky!

215
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:21,715
-He was my friend!
-He was a Jap!

216
00:56:21,924 --> 00:56:23,675
The war's over!

217
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:29,640
You walked all the way
here from Nantao Stadium?

218
00:56:34,311 --> 00:56:38,190
What did you see? Rich pickings?

219
00:56:38,398 --> 00:56:40,984
Crystal chandeliers, cocktail bars...

220
00:56:41,193 --> 00:56:43,195
...white pianos?

221
00:56:50,118 --> 00:56:52,371
I learned a new word today.

222
00:56:54,832 --> 00:56:56,583
Atom bomb.

223
00:56:58,836 --> 00:57:02,005
It was like a white light
in the sky.

224
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:07,553
Like God taking a photograph.

225
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:11,849
I saw it.

226
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,698
I can bring everyone back.

227
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:32,870
I can bring everyone back.

228
00:57:34,746 --> 00:57:36,165
Everyone.

229
00:57:39,126 --> 00:57:41,420
I can bring everyone back.

230
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:44,506
Everyone.

231
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:48,343
I can bring everyone back.

232
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:32,888
-Didn't I teach you anything?
-Yes!

233
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:39,770
You taught me people will do
anything for a potato.

234
00:58:42,231 --> 00:58:44,107
Three years with him?

235
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:47,694
Come on. I'll take you
back to your dad.

236
00:58:47,903 --> 00:58:52,491
You can retire
and eat three meals a day.

237
00:59:29,611 --> 00:59:32,281
Kid, you want a Hershey bar?

238
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:35,409
Yes, please, Basie.

239
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:38,615
I surrender.

240
01:02:20,657 --> 01:02:22,493
Come along. Off you go.

241
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:27,414
Gather in, children. Come along.

242
01:02:51,688 --> 01:02:52,898
Mum.

243
01:03:10,249 --> 01:03:12,417
Ju-- Julie!

244
01:03:46,535 --> 01:03:47,953
Jamie?

245
01:03:53,584 --> 01:03:55,294
Jamie.
