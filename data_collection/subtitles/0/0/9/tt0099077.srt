1
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:36,642
- Want to go fishing?
- The fish are frozen.

2
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:43,558
Look at that car...
Is it not neat? It must be a Ford.

3
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:45,720
No, it is not a Ford.

4
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:50,201
- Then what it is?
- I do not know, but it is not a Ford.

5
00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:11,368
- Leonard, what are you doing?
- What does it look like?

6
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,407
Somebody might be coming.

7
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:18,920
No one is coming.

8
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:28,278
What is wrong?

9
00:01:56,289 --> 00:02:02,558
Leonard, honey. Better get dressed.
Your breakfast is ready.

10
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:29,688
We will begin with a history test.

11
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:36,527
Keep your eyes on your own papers,
and at recess bring your books to me.

12
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:38,565
<i>Hi, Mrs Lowe.</i>
<i>Can Leonard come out today?</i>

13
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:42,642
<i>- No, I am sorry. Not today</i>
<i>- How about tomorrow?</i>

14
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:47,405
<i>- He will not be well then either.</i>
<i>- When will he be well?</i>

15
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,764
<i>I do not know.</i>

16
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:56,443
<i>Thank you for coming by.</i>

17
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:15,728
- Excuse me...
- You have to ask her.

18
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:23,004
Bainbridge Hospital, can I help you?
Dr Franklin and Dr Tyler -

19
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:26,764
- are in a meeting. Can I take a message?

20
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:32,722
I am Dr Malcolm Sayer,
I have an appointment.

21
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:37,599
Take a seat, please...
Bainbridge Hospital, may I help you?

22
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:59,321
When you say people,
you mean living people?

23
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:06,242
I apply for a research position
in the neurology lab.

24
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:10,002
We have an x-ray room.

25
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,799
This is a chronic hospital.
The position is for staff neurologist.

26
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:20,123
- You will be working with people.
- A doctor, Doctor.

27
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:24,999
- Any patients at the Carmel Institute?
- Earthworms.

28
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:26,488
Sorry?

29
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:31,006
It was an immense project.
I was to extract 1 decigram myelin -

30
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:34,206
- from 4 tons of earthworms.

31
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:40,763
I worked on that for 5 years,
everyone else said it could not be done.

32
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:44,922
- It cannot.
- I know that now. I proved it.

33
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,885
Maybe before... at St Thomas?

34
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:51,199
All research?

35
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:54,241
We are understaffed...

36
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:57,640
He has never worked with human beings...

37
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:06,482
Excuse me, you are looking for someone
with a clinical background.

38
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:12,281
As much as I need a job, there must be
100 more suitable applicants.

39
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:15,648
How about medical school?

40
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:19,006
You could not graduate
without some clinical experience.

41
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:23,606
You took a pulse, a temperature.
You did diagnosis.

42
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,999
There you have it, then.

43
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,763
You do want the job, do you not?

44
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:40,078
This way, Doc... You spend much time
in a chronic hospital?

45
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:44,561
- You would remember.
- I guess not, then.

46
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:51,962
We have M.S., Tourette syndrome,
Parkinson's disease -

47
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:56,247
- some of them
we have not got a name for.

48
00:07:57,249 --> 00:08:00,685
- What are they waiting for?
- Nothing.

49
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:03,682
- How will they get well?
- They will not. They are chronic.

50
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:08,798
We call it the garden because
all we do is feed and water them.

51
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,040
Mr Kean? Can I ask...

52
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:18,999
I was born 1911 in Kingsbridge, New York.
I came here in July 1955.

53
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:24,448
Prior to that,
I was at Brooklyn Psychiatric Center.

54
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:27,077
Prior to that, I was a person.

55
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:05,599
It gets easier.

56
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:09,125
You do not think it will,
but it does.

57
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:48,602
No, Buttercup...
Go to your house.

58
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:47,366
Good morning, Doctor...
I have a new arrival for you.

59
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,239
She was brought in late last night.
Here is her file.

60
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:05,166
Hello, I am Dr Sayer.

61
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:10,722
Do you know where you are?

62
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:16,122
Can you hear me?

63
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:10,323
Medical insurance?

64
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:38,358
Her name is Lucy Fishman.
She was found with her sister -

65
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:40,485
- many days after her sister died.

66
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:45,245
She has no living relatives.
She has always been as she is now.

67
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,845
With no response or comprehension.
And yet...

68
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:53,644
A reflex.

69
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:59,202
If she batted it away, but she did not.
As you can see, she caught it.

70
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:01,200
It is still a reflex.

71
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,564
If you were right, I would agree.

72
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:08,849
It is as if, having lost her own will,
she borrows the will of the ball.

73
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:12,479
- The will of the ball?
- Excuse me.

74
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:21,561
You are trying to make a
good impression, that is it, right?

75
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:23,924
You are still settling in.

76
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:27,479
Miss Costello, see to it that
Dr Sayer's waiting patients -

77
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:30,447
- are rescheduled for tomorrow.

78
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:34,127
Borrows the will of the ball?

79
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:37,283
That is great.

80
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:39,804
Okay, thank you.

81
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:44,358
Let us know if
she catches anything else.

82
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:11,288
I will be fired. It is all right,
I will go back to school.

83
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:14,561
Did I forget something?

84
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:19,439
No, I wanted to say
that I preferred your explanation.

85
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:24,399
I will look after things for you
until you have settled in.

86
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:28,799
- Good night, Doctor.
- Thank you.

87
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:58,442
- Hello, I am Dr Sayer.
- I am Waheedah.

88
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:01,521
- How are you today?
- Fine, thank you...

89
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:11,322
Yes, sorry. What form?
Yes, I will hold.

90
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:23,437
Okay. Three, one, two.

91
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:26,724
Thank you. Bye.

92
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:38,285
Hello.

93
00:16:56,969 --> 00:17:02,919
<i>- Yipee! We are in orbit.</i>
<i>- Now we can try being weightless.</i>

94
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:11,169
<i>Let us celebrate with delicious</i>
<i>Nestle's Quick.</i>

95
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:15,447
<i>Nestle's chocolate flavour is</i>
<i>out of this world.</i>

96
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:21,204
<i>Hello up there, time to recharge</i>
<i>with delicious Nestle's Quick.</i>

97
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:52,921
Lucy...

98
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:56,998
You are out...

99
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:14,083
Anthony, would you help me...
move this?

100
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,925
Excuse me.

101
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:53,803
Lucy, you are almost there.

102
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:14,923
Here is the water, Lucy.

103
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:29,719
I wonder why your nails grow so fast?

104
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:34,719
It must be all that Jello they give you.

105
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:38,199
Jello, Jello, day after day.

106
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:43,521
Red Jello, yellow Jello, every day Jello.

107
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:53,966
I forgot to tell you,
Mrs Cooper passed away. Remember her?

108
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:57,326
She was nice. Always a kind word.

109
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,525
Her dog I could have done without.

110
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:03,125
- Excuse me?
- Hello.

111
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:07,562
Does he ever speak to you?

112
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:13,599
- Of course not. Not in words.
- He speaks to you in other ways?

113
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:15,646
How do you mean?

114
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:20,041
- You do not have children.
- No.

115
00:20:20,209 --> 00:20:23,485
If you did, you would know.

116
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,887
It says "atypical schizophrenia".

117
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:36,765
"Atypical hysteria", this one.

118
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:41,406
"Atypical nerve impairment".

119
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:45,005
"No change since last examination."

120
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:47,637
"No change or therapy recommended."

121
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:49,800
Very nice.

122
00:20:49,969 --> 00:20:54,326
This one is "No change", dated 9/11/44.

123
00:20:57,409 --> 00:20:59,843
That is 25 years.

124
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:05,686
At a point all these atypical somethings
ought to amount to a typical something.

125
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,079
But a typical what?

126
00:21:08,249 --> 00:21:13,118
Doctor, do you want to go for
a cup of coffee or something?

127
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:15,007
Tea?

128
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:21,165
Normally, I would say yes,
but I made other plans.

129
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:24,366
- Some other time.
- Yes.

130
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:18,762
"Encephalitis lethargica".

131
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:21,045
Where is it?

132
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:30,287
Sorry,
I thought someone had left the light on.

133
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:34,237
I found the connection.
They all survived encephalitis -

134
00:22:34,409 --> 00:22:38,163
- years before they came here.
See? In the 1920's.

135
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:42,959
- Is it not wonderful?
- Yes, I will come back later.

136
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:07,926
How many have you found there?

137
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:11,047
Five. And I believe there are more.

138
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:15,638
How are they?

139
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:21,602
As you described them back then:
"Insubstantial as ghosts".

140
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:26,968
Only I guess...
many of them were children back then.

141
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:31,281
Yes, children who fell asleep.

142
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:39,564
Most died
during the acute stage of the illness.

143
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:43,119
Those who survived... who awoke -

144
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,804
- seemed fine,
as if nothing had happened.

145
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:53,442
We just did not realise how much
the infection had damaged the brain.

146
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:57,568
Years went by.
Five, ten, fifteen -

147
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:03,642
- before these strange,
neurological symptoms would appear.

148
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,846
But they did.

149
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:11,961
I began to see them in the early 1930's.

150
00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:15,326
Old people brought in by their children.

151
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:18,686
Young people brought in by their parents.

152
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:24,559
They could no longer dress themselves
or feed themselves.

153
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:28,278
They could no longer speak in most cases.

154
00:24:28,449 --> 00:24:31,122
Certain families went mad.

155
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:33,325
People who were normal -

156
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:35,445
- were now -

157
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:39,522
- elsewhere.

158
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:45,087
What is it like to be them?
What are they thinking?

159
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:47,160
They are not.

160
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:52,922
The virus did not spare
their higher faculties.

161
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:56,684
- We know that for a fact?
- Yes.

162
00:24:56,849 --> 00:25:02,799
- Because?
- Because the alternative is unthinkable.

163
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:07,359
I am all for fixing this place up,
but, what are we doing?

164
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:09,804
I have a hunch.

165
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:14,287
What stops Lucy
from reaching the fountain?

166
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:15,438
Nothing.

167
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:20,922
Exactly, the visual field just stops.
There is no pattern.

168
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:24,001
Nothing to compel her to keep going.

169
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:28,321
- So, we are making something.
- Exactly.

170
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:16,758
She is looking out the...

171
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:40,006
- I want to know more about your son.
- Certainly.

172
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:49,645
Something was wrong with his hands.
He could not write anymore.

173
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:52,607
He could not do the work.

174
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:58,241
I should take him out of school,
they said. He was eleven.

175
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:00,206
Slowly, he got worse.

176
00:28:00,369 --> 00:28:03,964
He would call me and I would come in
and he was sitting at his desk -

177
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:10,728
- in a trance. One hour, two hours...
Then he would be okay again.

178
00:28:11,729 --> 00:28:16,086
One day I came home from work
and found him in his bed.

179
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:23,200
He kept saying, "Mum, mum?"...
His arm was like this, reaching.

180
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:26,645
"What do you want, Leonard?"

181
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:31,041
He never spoke again.
It was as if he disappeared.

182
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:35,805
Later, that year,
I took him to Bainbridge.

183
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:41,803
It was... November 14, 1939.

184
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,363
He was twenty years old.

185
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:48,965
What did he do for those nine years
in this room?

186
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:53,919
He read. He loved to read.
He read all the time.

187
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:56,728
Really?

188
00:28:57,249 --> 00:28:59,922
That was all he could do.

189
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:22,004
That is enough.

190
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:30,760
All right, Leonard. We are finished.

191
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:38,767
Nothing, nothing, nothing and...
Nothing.

192
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:43,478
- It is one of your statues.
- Exactly.

193
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:46,004
Pass the salt.

194
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:54,087
- What about this.
- What do you mean? It is a strobe.

195
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:57,798
You are wrong.
All of this before is the strobe.

196
00:29:57,969 --> 00:30:01,120
This is me saying his name to him.

197
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:05,799
Excuse me.

198
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:24,604
Straight down the middle.
Home it in there!

199
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:30,284
I can catch the ball. Throw me the ball!

200
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:46,000
Is this all of them?
Bring them in here with the others.

201
00:31:03,449 --> 00:31:08,284
<i>I should have given David his divorce.</i>
<i>I thought he wanted to be a father...</i>

202
00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:15,121
The patients have been given
their morning medication.

203
00:31:16,289 --> 00:31:20,965
Dr Sayer hoped you had some free time.
Come with me, please.

204
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:31,725
This is a beautiful aria.
Watch them closely for any reaction.

205
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:54,884
"Call me Ishmael."

206
00:32:00,689 --> 00:32:03,920
"Some years ago,
never mind how long precisely, -

207
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:08,799
- having little money, and nothing
in particular to interest me on shore."

208
00:32:10,249 --> 00:32:15,562
I know you can hear me.
Try to respond when I speak your name.

209
00:32:18,489 --> 00:32:24,598
It is not just any music.
It has to be right for them.

210
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:34,682
It is as if they are only moved
by music that moves them.

211
00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:39,206
I have not found anything
that moves Bert, yet.

212
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:51,918
They sit there all day, if I let them.

213
00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:54,649
I have to play the first card.

214
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:08,925
Leonard... L...

215
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:38,847
This is Frank.
Help me get him to his feet.

216
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:43,878
There is something else
that reaches him... Human contact.

217
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:46,802
Stand over there for a minute.

218
00:33:46,969 --> 00:33:51,326
He cannot walk without me.
If I let go of him, he will fall.

219
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:53,764
I will not let you fall.

220
00:33:56,129 --> 00:33:59,280
But... he will walk with me anywhere.

221
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:04,238
It is like the ball,
it is my will he is borrowing.

222
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,367
The will of another human being.

223
00:34:30,249 --> 00:34:35,607
I will begin by moving the pointer to L
for Leonard.

224
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:41,601
When I sense you move the pointer,
I will stop and you will take over.

225
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:46,285
Do you understand?...
All right. I will begin.

226
00:34:58,649 --> 00:35:02,722
No, maybe I did not make myself clear.
My fault, I...

227
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:17,522
L... Good, good.
Now the E.

228
00:35:24,009 --> 00:35:26,443
E, good.

229
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:30,246
S...

230
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:35,759
P...

231
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:39,399
You are spelling something else.

232
00:36:25,929 --> 00:36:29,160
<i>"His gaze,</i>
<i>from staring through the bars, -

233
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:34,198
<i>- has grown so weary</i>
<i>that it can take in nothing more.</i>

234
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:38,203
<i>For him, it is as though</i>
<i>there were a thousand bars -

235
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:42,408
<i>- and behind the thousand bars,</i>
<i>no world.</i>

236
00:36:43,689 --> 00:36:48,240
<i>As he paces in cramped circles,</i>
<i>over and over, -

237
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:51,924
<i>- his powerful strides are</i>
<i>like a ritual dance around a centre</i> -

238
00:36:52,089 --> 00:36:56,207
<i>- where a great will stands paralysed.</i>

239
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:03,000
<i>At times the curtains of the eye lift</i>
<i>without a sound and a shape enters, -

240
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:06,161
<i>- slips through the tightened silence</i>
<i>of the shoulders, -

241
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:09,480
<i>- reaches the heart, and dies."</i>

242
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:21,559
Have you heard of a drug called L-dopa?
It is a synthetic dopamine.

243
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:25,039
Yes, for Parkinson's patients...

244
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,086
Why?

245
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:33,798
Excuse me, sorry!

246
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:39,964
100 years would pass
before modern neuropathology -

247
00:37:40,129 --> 00:37:45,647
- would allow us to locate the damage
in the Parkinsonian brain.

248
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:53,087
With our development of the drug L-dopa,
we can for the first time promise -

249
00:37:53,249 --> 00:37:59,199
- the Parkinsonian patient
a more normal life by administering L...

250
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:09,446
I am very curious about this drug.
Have you come across anyone who...

251
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:13,807
- Excuse me, Dr...
- Sayer.

252
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:17,518
Have you come across
any patients with encephalitis?

253
00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:22,001
After I am through, Dr Sayer.
If you would not mind.

254
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:30,202
As I was saying...
by administering L-dopa.

255
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:37,406
Do you think an
extreme Parkinsonian tremor -

256
00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:41,084
- would appear as no tremor at all?

257
00:38:44,209 --> 00:38:47,884
- Are you talking to me?
- Oh, yes.

258
00:38:49,449 --> 00:38:55,558
Imagine you accelerated a hand tremor
to the point of immobility.

259
00:38:55,729 --> 00:38:59,881
Imagine a patient with all the
Parkinson symptoms accelerated.

260
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:03,758
The hand tremor, the head bobbing,
quickening of speech.

261
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:09,720
Might they not cave in on themselves
and turn a person into stone?

262
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,687
I do not know. Maybe.

263
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:19,205
- Do you think L-dopa would help?
- Dr Sayer, right?

264
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:27,519
I am a chemist, you are the physician.
I will leave it to you to do the damage.

265
00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:38,408
Freud believed in miracles,
prescribing cocaine as candy.

266
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:42,562
We all believed in Cortisone
until our patients went psychotic on it.

267
00:39:42,729 --> 00:39:46,847
- And now it is L-dopa?
- I think it is too soon to say that.

268
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:51,639
With all due respect,
I think it is <i>way</i> too soon to say that.

269
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:54,846
Let the chemists do the damage, Doctor.

270
00:39:55,649 --> 00:39:57,287
But I...

271
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:14,677
Dr Kaufman, did you read this case?
"New drug lets Palsy patients eat Jello."

272
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:21,766
Yes, I read them all. Dutifully, soberly.
All 30 cases had mild Parkinson's.

273
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:26,923
Your "Parkies", if that is what they are,
have not moved in decades.

274
00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:29,842
Perhaps you should look at it again, sir.

275
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:34,319
You know better
than to make such a leap.

276
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:38,198
You want a connection;
that does not mean there is one.

277
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:44,046
What I believe, what I know,
is that they are alive inside.

278
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:50,198
How do you know that?
Because they catch tennis balls?

279
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:53,404
I know it.

280
00:40:54,209 --> 00:40:58,248
- How many did you think could have it?
- All of them.

281
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:02,403
Some... One.

282
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:06,599
One.

283
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:09,647
With the family's consent, signed.

284
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:19,883
Leonard has Parkinson's disease?

285
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:27,483
No... His symptoms are like
Parkinson's disease -

286
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:30,722
- but then again, they are not.

287
00:41:31,729 --> 00:41:35,005
What will the medicine do for him?

288
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:39,637
I do not know what it will do for him,
if anything at all.

289
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:43,006
What do you think it will do?

290
00:41:43,169 --> 00:41:48,721
I am not sure, it was designed for
a totally different disorder.

291
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:51,528
What do you hope it will do?

292
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:56,888
I hope... it will bring him back from
wherever he is.

293
00:41:58,129 --> 00:42:02,202
- To what?
- To the world.

294
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:08,998
What is there here for him
after all these years?

295
00:42:11,169 --> 00:42:14,605
You...
You are here.

296
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:54,520
All of it, please.

297
00:43:11,529 --> 00:43:16,125
- At 200 mg, he showed no response.
- Maybe the juice's acid neutralised it.

298
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:20,282
- Maybe he needs more.
- Maybe he needs less.

299
00:43:21,689 --> 00:43:23,884
I will try it in milk.

300
00:43:57,769 --> 00:43:59,680
500 mg.

301
00:44:06,409 --> 00:44:10,641
- I will call if there is any change.
- Yes.

302
00:44:18,009 --> 00:44:20,204
Thank you.

303
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:09,120
It is quiet.

304
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:13,962
It is late. Everyone is asleep.

305
00:47:20,249 --> 00:47:26,006
- I am not asleep.
- No, you are awake.

306
00:47:37,049 --> 00:47:39,358
May I?

307
00:47:55,569 --> 00:47:57,560
Me.

308
00:49:05,929 --> 00:49:10,002
Leonard,
there is someone here to see you.

309
00:49:25,009 --> 00:49:27,318
Mum... Mum!

310
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:56,004
- My name is Eleanor.
- Eleanor.

311
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:04,922
- It is a pleasure to meet you.
- It is a pleasure to meet you.

312
00:50:08,889 --> 00:50:12,359
- Ladies?
- Now, what did I do?

313
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:17,963
Oh, my goodness.

314
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:24,081
How do you do, sir?
My name is Margaret.

315
00:50:27,849 --> 00:50:29,919
Beth.

316
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:42,807
Anthony. How are you?

317
00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:46,881
Great man. How are you?

318
00:50:47,889 --> 00:50:50,449
Great, too.

319
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:57,079
- Did you meet him?
- Did he not look good?

320
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:11,128
I could not deal with losing
30 years of my life, could you?

321
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:19,765
He does realise it, does he not?

322
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:30,606
Turn this way, please. It is a camera
called a Polaroid. Thank you.

323
00:51:32,129 --> 00:51:36,441
Takes a picture in less than a minute.
Amazing.

324
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:38,964
Now, we could try this.

325
00:51:44,169 --> 00:51:49,368
Splendid... I would like you to walk
to the end of the room.

326
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:53,204
Ready? Go.

327
00:51:55,169 --> 00:51:57,444
Very good.

328
00:52:02,169 --> 00:52:04,603
And back now.

329
00:52:09,849 --> 00:52:13,967
That was very quick...
Let me get some more film.

330
00:53:08,729 --> 00:53:13,041
You have to at least lay down.
You need the rest.

331
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:24,842
I am afraid to close my eyes.
If I close my eyes I will...

332
00:53:25,009 --> 00:53:31,926
You will sleep. When you wake up in the
morning, it will be the next morning.

333
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:34,364
I promise.

334
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:49,281
<i>Baby's boat, a silver moon,</i>
<i>sailing in the sky.</i>

335
00:53:50,889 --> 00:53:57,158
<i>Baby is fishing for a dream,</i>
<i>fishing near and far.</i>

336
00:53:59,009 --> 00:54:02,046
<i>Sail, baby, sail -

337
00:54:03,249 --> 00:54:05,922
<i>- out upon that sea.</i>

338
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:14,286
<i>Only do not forget to sail</i>
<i>back again to</i> me.

339
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:45,164
What a wonderful place the Bronx
has become.

340
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:02,767
- That is my school.
- Really?

341
00:56:10,689 --> 00:56:15,365
- Is that classical?
- You can pick any type of music.

342
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:22,638
- What is that?
- It is rock 'n ' roll.

343
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:44,847
Come on in.

344
00:57:45,009 --> 00:57:50,288
No, something happened
while you were away. It is called pollution.

345
00:57:50,449 --> 00:57:54,681
Leonard, that is not wading,
that is swimming!

346
00:57:54,849 --> 00:57:59,320
I do not know if the hospital
is covered for this.

347
00:58:00,329 --> 00:58:03,048
- Come on!
- No.

348
00:58:10,849 --> 00:58:13,682
Leonard, the tide is coming in.

349
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:31,437
That is the Periodic Table of Elements -

350
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:35,318
- I can date my introduction
to science by that.

351
00:58:35,489 --> 00:58:40,609
It is wonderful, really...
It is the universe at its essence.

352
00:58:40,769 --> 00:58:46,241
You have your alkaline metals.
You have your halogens, your inert gases.

353
00:58:46,409 --> 00:58:50,880
Every element has its place in that order.
You cannot change that.

354
00:58:51,049 --> 00:58:54,564
They are secure, no matter what.

355
00:58:54,729 --> 00:58:57,163
You are not married?

356
00:58:57,329 --> 00:59:03,086
Me? No...
I am not very good with people.

357
00:59:05,609 --> 00:59:09,602
I never have been, Leonard...
I like them.

358
00:59:11,929 --> 00:59:17,526
I wish I had more than
a rudimentary understanding of them.

359
00:59:18,449 --> 00:59:21,839
Maybe, if they were less unpredictable.

360
00:59:22,209 --> 00:59:25,406
Eleanor would disagree with you.

361
00:59:27,409 --> 00:59:30,321
- Eleanor?
- Miss Costello.

362
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:38,562
She has spoken to you about me?

363
00:59:41,769 --> 00:59:44,237
What did she say?

364
00:59:44,409 --> 00:59:50,279
That you were a kind man.
That you care very much for people.

365
00:59:55,689 --> 01:00:00,968
I would like to put the others on the drug.
I realise this may be expensive.

366
01:00:01,129 --> 01:00:05,281
- Have you got any idea <i>how</i> expensive?
- Yes, I talked to Ray.

367
01:00:05,449 --> 01:00:07,599
I have an estimate...

368
01:00:08,969 --> 01:00:14,885
The pharmacist says giving all the rest
the same dosage as Mr Lowe would be -

369
01:00:15,049 --> 01:00:16,926
- 12,000.

370
01:00:17,089 --> 01:00:19,523
- How much?
- $12,000.

371
01:00:19,689 --> 01:00:23,728
A month?
I cannot go before the board with that.

372
01:00:23,889 --> 01:00:27,279
How about speaking
directly to the patrons?

373
01:00:27,449 --> 01:00:30,009
They already give what they can.

374
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:35,368
We must convince them to give more
than they are accustomed to.

375
01:00:35,529 --> 01:00:41,365
- Perhaps, if they see Mr Lowe.
- You overestimate his effect on people.

376
01:00:41,529 --> 01:00:44,327
We are talking about money.

377
01:01:22,209 --> 01:01:26,168
There was an extreme rigidity
of the axial musculature.

378
01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:30,004
This is a gross impairment
of the postural reflexes.

379
01:01:30,169 --> 01:01:34,048
It is a brain stem type of rigidity.
A meningismus.

380
01:01:34,209 --> 01:01:38,521
What is most striking is
the profound facial masking -

381
01:01:38,689 --> 01:01:43,524
- which we now know is not to be
confused with apathy or catatonia.

382
01:01:44,889 --> 01:01:47,642
Less scientific.
Calm down!

383
01:01:49,569 --> 01:01:52,447
Some things could reach him, though.

384
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:58,320
The mention of his name,
notes of a particular piece of music.

385
01:01:58,489 --> 01:02:01,606
The touch of another human being.

386
01:02:03,889 --> 01:02:08,679
But these awakenings were rare and
transient, lasting only a moment.

387
01:02:08,849 --> 01:02:11,682
Otherwise he was as you see him here,
in a metaphorical, -

388
01:02:11,849 --> 01:02:16,479
- if not physiological, equivalent of sleep.
Or even death.

389
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:20,688
This was his condition
when I found him at this hospital -

390
01:02:20,849 --> 01:02:25,320
- and the quality of his life
for the last 30 years.

391
01:02:32,609 --> 01:02:35,487
<i>- Now?</i>
<i>- Whenever you are ready.</i>

392
01:02:37,569 --> 01:02:40,163
<i>My name is Leonard Lowe.</i>

393
01:02:40,329 --> 01:02:46,518
<i>It has been explained to me that</i>
<i>I have been away for quite some time.</i>

394
01:02:48,929 --> 01:02:51,079
<i>I am back.</i>

395
01:03:10,249 --> 01:03:13,844
Here we go. Take her away.

396
01:03:15,529 --> 01:03:17,599
Thank you very much.

397
01:03:53,169 --> 01:03:55,524
- Dr Sayer!
- What is it?

398
01:03:55,689 --> 01:03:57,805
It is a fucking miracle.

399
01:04:05,129 --> 01:04:08,166
- Where are my glasses?
- On your face.

400
01:04:20,529 --> 01:04:22,520
Can this be so?

401
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:32,206
I am talking.

402
01:04:55,609 --> 01:04:59,284
I am walking... Who are you?

403
01:05:18,929 --> 01:05:22,399
Thank you for coming.
Things are a little different today.

404
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:43,808
I... I had the strangest dream.

405
01:05:43,969 --> 01:05:45,960
I have to take your blood pressure.

406
01:05:46,129 --> 01:05:49,121
I have been sitting for 25 years,
you missed your chance.

407
01:05:50,369 --> 01:05:52,121
Are you okay?

408
01:05:53,609 --> 01:05:58,763
- I need some make-up.
- Okay, we can take care of that.

409
01:05:58,929 --> 01:06:02,968
And some dye for my hair... black.

410
01:06:03,129 --> 01:06:07,998
- Black? Rose, are you sure?
- Yes, it has always been black.

411
01:06:08,169 --> 01:06:11,047
Dr Sayer, something about fruit trees.

412
01:06:11,209 --> 01:06:14,565
- Prune the fruit trees.
- I will.

413
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:20,599
I want a steak, rare.
Mashed potatoes and gravy. String beans.

414
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:24,762
I was aware of things, but nothing
meant anything to me.

415
01:06:24,929 --> 01:06:29,719
It was no connection to me.
There was a war or two.

416
01:06:31,249 --> 01:06:34,878
This morning I went to the bathroom
all by myself.

417
01:06:40,449 --> 01:06:42,485
I think I liked them better the other way.

418
01:06:47,929 --> 01:06:53,481
Rolando, can you speak to me?
It is Miss Costello.

419
01:06:56,009 --> 01:06:58,284
Do you understand me?

420
01:07:02,849 --> 01:07:08,879
- Lucy... What year is it?
- What year is it?

421
01:07:13,569 --> 01:07:15,685
It is '26, silly.

422
01:07:18,609 --> 01:07:20,884
Come on, Miriam, be a sport.

423
01:07:36,809 --> 01:07:42,202
"Like crowds storming the Bastille, the
Mighty Mets stormed their locker room -

424
01:07:42,369 --> 01:07:45,520
- on their night to remember.

425
01:07:45,689 --> 01:07:49,045
And touched off one of the
loudest, wildest, -

426
01:07:49,209 --> 01:07:52,485
- wettest victory celebrations
in baseball history.

427
01:07:52,649 --> 01:07:58,167
Released from ridicule after seven
destitute seasons, they raised the roof."

428
01:08:11,169 --> 01:08:13,842
- Hi, Sydney.
- Hi.

429
01:08:26,529 --> 01:08:30,363
- Will we go to the same place?
- Actually, I do not know.

430
01:08:30,529 --> 01:08:32,520
Everybody stay together!

431
01:08:39,009 --> 01:08:42,763
- Bring Leonard back.
- Anthony, will you get Leonard?

432
01:08:51,609 --> 01:08:54,567
Everyone, please stay with the group.

433
01:09:10,209 --> 01:09:13,724
- How is my father doing?
- The same.

434
01:09:13,889 --> 01:09:18,917
- Mum, maybe you should not go.
- Of course, I want to go.

435
01:09:22,929 --> 01:09:26,763
You cannot be there, Leonard,
or the door will not close.

436
01:09:28,929 --> 01:09:34,003
- I do not understand. Sydney is going.
- He is a patient.

437
01:09:34,169 --> 01:09:37,844
- Not the same kind of patient.
- He is still a patient, you are not.

438
01:09:38,009 --> 01:09:42,685
- I am your mother.
- Are there any other mothers going?

439
01:09:44,569 --> 01:09:46,719
What have you done to your hair?

440
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:51,278
- It is a tire.
- I know... I am not an idiot.

441
01:09:57,369 --> 01:10:01,362
- You treat me like an asshole.
- We will take care of that.

442
01:10:14,809 --> 01:10:17,960
- Are you ready?
- I will stay here.

443
01:10:18,129 --> 01:10:21,565
- Why? What is wrong?
- I am okay, I just...

444
01:10:21,729 --> 01:10:23,242
Wave.

445
01:10:28,689 --> 01:10:31,078
Doctor, come on!

446
01:10:32,089 --> 01:10:34,364
Are you sure? Are you all right?

447
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:38,647
I am fine, I will see you later.
Have a good time.

448
01:10:53,209 --> 01:10:56,804
Hi... Meatloaf, please.

449
01:11:02,169 --> 01:11:05,081
- Meatloaf.
- Meatloaf, too.

450
01:11:15,489 --> 01:11:18,208
Are you following me?

451
01:11:19,329 --> 01:11:24,608
I am sorry, I was only kidding.
I saw you upstairs just now.

452
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:29,603
- Are you visiting someone?
- No.

453
01:11:29,769 --> 01:11:31,680
You work here.

454
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:34,645
I live here.

455
01:11:35,169 --> 01:11:37,125
You are a patient?

456
01:11:38,809 --> 01:11:42,040
You do not look like a patient.

457
01:11:42,209 --> 01:11:43,847
I do not?

458
01:11:58,529 --> 01:12:01,168
I have always loved carnegia.

459
01:12:01,329 --> 01:12:05,720
Dr Sayer...
Did you choose this place?

460
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:08,801
- Why?
- I always come here.

461
01:12:09,809 --> 01:12:15,884
It is a nice place, but after
the first hour, it loses something.

462
01:12:16,049 --> 01:12:20,645
- Anthony thinks the group is bored.
- They are.

463
01:12:20,809 --> 01:12:25,678
I thought about taking them
to the Opera House...

464
01:12:25,849 --> 01:12:27,805
Or the Museum of Natural History?

465
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:33,043
No... There are
a lot of dead, stuffed things there.

466
01:12:35,729 --> 01:12:37,720
Where else is there?

467
01:13:15,609 --> 01:13:19,318
- Is it legal again?
- Yes, for some time.

468
01:13:19,489 --> 01:13:22,367
Ladies, what can I get you?

469
01:13:22,529 --> 01:13:24,963
A Rob Roy on the rocks.

470
01:13:25,129 --> 01:13:27,245
Make that a virgin Rob Roy.

471
01:13:32,049 --> 01:13:35,280
I work night shifts at this diner.

472
01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:39,727
Sometimes before work
I come to see my father.

473
01:13:40,569 --> 01:13:46,963
He used to go to all the games,
so I like to read him the sports pages.

474
01:13:47,129 --> 01:13:52,999
I do not know if he knows I visit him.
My mother does not think so.

475
01:13:54,009 --> 01:13:56,364
But, you do.

476
01:13:58,089 --> 01:14:03,846
Sometimes I think I see something...
I think I see a change.

477
01:14:04,569 --> 01:14:10,565
And for a moment, I see him
like he was before the stroke.

478
01:14:12,649 --> 01:14:19,282
And then it is gone; I am not sure
I saw anything. Does that make any sense?

479
01:14:19,449 --> 01:14:21,326
Yes.

480
01:14:36,809 --> 01:14:39,323
So, why are you here?

481
01:14:41,249 --> 01:14:44,685
- I receive medication.
- For what?

482
01:14:48,369 --> 01:14:52,408
Without it,
I am sort of like your father.

483
01:14:58,249 --> 01:15:02,083
- But I am okay now.
- That is good.

484
01:16:04,449 --> 01:16:09,967
I was so sure he wanted overeasy
with bacon, wheat toast, black coffee -

485
01:16:10,129 --> 01:16:13,007
- I brought him his food
without taking his order.

486
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:16,320
He just said: "You forgot the tomato."

487
01:16:17,529 --> 01:16:21,841
We were out of them.
That is why I did not give him one.

488
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:36,648
- It was really nice talking to you.
- It was nice talking to you, too.

489
01:16:41,929 --> 01:16:44,318
- Paula?
- Yes.

490
01:16:44,489 --> 01:16:49,517
He knows...
Your father knows you visit him.

491
01:17:09,609 --> 01:17:12,567
Doctor, these are my friends.

492
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:17,517
Is he not the cat's meow?

493
01:17:29,409 --> 01:17:33,800
Miriam, I do not know how to say this,
so I will just say it...

494
01:17:33,969 --> 01:17:35,800
Your husband -

495
01:17:38,729 --> 01:17:43,007
- was granted a divorce from you in 1953.

496
01:17:45,969 --> 01:17:48,437
Thank God!

497
01:17:52,129 --> 01:17:58,318
Look at that! Pontiac Firebird, 400
engine... Now, that is a car, man.

498
01:17:59,889 --> 01:18:04,838
- Lucy, may I have your hand?
- Take me away from this place.

499
01:18:08,649 --> 01:18:12,437
- Wrong. It is here.
- I guess I lose.

500
01:18:13,449 --> 01:18:17,647
I guess your luck is changing...
Very nice.

501
01:18:19,689 --> 01:18:23,079
- How is it going?
- How is it going?

502
01:18:23,249 --> 01:18:25,558
Yes, how do you feel?

503
01:18:27,249 --> 01:18:32,403
Well, my parents are dead,
my wife is in an institution, -

504
01:18:32,569 --> 01:18:36,244
- my son has disappeared
out West somewhere...

505
01:18:37,249 --> 01:18:42,607
I feel old and I feel swindled.
That is how I feel.

506
01:18:46,369 --> 01:18:50,760
I stopped by the hobby shop
and got more pencils.

507
01:18:50,929 --> 01:18:53,238
And I got this...

508
01:18:55,009 --> 01:18:58,479
A small T-square.

509
01:18:58,649 --> 01:19:01,163
I can use that, yes.

510
01:19:12,609 --> 01:19:14,725
That is really nice.

511
01:19:16,689 --> 01:19:20,284
- I will be right back.
- Leonard?

512
01:19:25,849 --> 01:19:28,807
He never talked about girls before.

513
01:19:29,969 --> 01:19:34,247
He certainly never had
anything to do with them.

514
01:19:34,409 --> 01:19:38,721
It is a bit ridiculous, all this
girl business. Do you not think so?

515
01:19:38,889 --> 01:19:40,561
He is a grown man.

516
01:19:40,729 --> 01:19:47,441
He said I should take a vacation.
Go away for a few days and relax.

517
01:19:47,609 --> 01:19:52,080
I am sure he meant
you deserve a vacation, which you do.

518
01:19:52,249 --> 01:19:57,118
I cannot leave him alone in this place.
He would die without me.

519
01:19:59,529 --> 01:20:01,724
Girls!

520
01:20:14,649 --> 01:20:20,679
<i>Hello? ...Dr Sayer?</i>
<i>I have to talk to you.</i>

521
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:22,521
Leonard?

522
01:20:22,689 --> 01:20:28,480
<i>I think it is important some things</i>
<i>were said. I just have to talk to you.</i>

523
01:20:28,649 --> 01:20:30,128
What kind of things?

524
01:20:30,289 --> 01:20:35,522
Things that matter, that have happened
to me. Things I now understand.

525
01:20:35,689 --> 01:20:39,682
<i>- Where are you calling from?</i>
- Your office.

526
01:20:39,849 --> 01:20:42,647
<i>- It is very late.</i>
- Is it?

527
01:20:42,809 --> 01:20:47,325
- You stay there, I will be right over.
<i>- Good.</i>

528
01:20:58,609 --> 01:21:03,239
- Dr Sayer, sit down.
- Why? What is wrong?

529
01:21:04,729 --> 01:21:09,678
We have to tell everybody.
We have to remind them how good it is.

530
01:21:09,849 --> 01:21:12,727
How good what is, Leonard?

531
01:21:12,889 --> 01:21:18,088
Read the newspaper.
What does it say? It is all bad.

532
01:21:18,249 --> 01:21:22,322
People have forgotten what life is all about.
What it is to be alive.

533
01:21:22,489 --> 01:21:27,165
They need to be reminded of
what they have and what they can lose.

534
01:21:27,329 --> 01:21:32,767
What I feel is the joy of life,
the gift of life, the freedom of life!

535
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:36,239
He says that people
do not appreciate the simple things.

536
01:21:36,409 --> 01:21:40,038
Work, play, friendship... family.

537
01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:44,202
He was so excited he talked
until 5 o'clock in the morning.

538
01:21:44,369 --> 01:21:48,123
- Is it liberation, mania...
- Or love?

539
01:21:48,289 --> 01:21:53,283
Yes. What he is saying is right, though.
We do not know how to live.

540
01:21:53,449 --> 01:21:55,485
But at 5 in the morning!

541
01:21:55,729 --> 01:21:59,688
- Waheedah... How are you?
- I am fine.

542
01:22:19,529 --> 01:22:23,317
- Mr Lowe, are you all right?
- Yes.

543
01:22:34,129 --> 01:22:37,280
- What is it that you want?
- The simplest thing.

544
01:22:37,449 --> 01:22:39,326
And that is?

545
01:22:40,729 --> 01:22:45,484
To go for a walk if I want to,
like any normal person.

546
01:22:48,729 --> 01:22:53,598
- You are free to go for a walk.
- I am? Alone?

547
01:22:55,009 --> 01:22:57,807
What difference would it make?

548
01:22:57,969 --> 01:23:01,723
Look, I am not a criminal.
I have committed no crime, -

549
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:07,964
- I am not a danger to myself or others.
But I am not allowed to walk by myself.

550
01:23:09,289 --> 01:23:13,646
You did not wake a thing,
you woke a person... I am a person.

551
01:23:15,929 --> 01:23:21,481
Are you aware of the unconscious
hostility you exhibit towards us?

552
01:23:21,649 --> 01:23:24,880
How can I be aware, if it is unconscious?

553
01:23:27,809 --> 01:23:31,927
I am curious.
What would you do if you went out?

554
01:23:34,529 --> 01:23:38,647
I would go for a walk,
look at things, talk to people.

555
01:23:38,809 --> 01:23:45,965
Decide which direction I want to go.
All the things that you take for granted.

556
01:23:48,849 --> 01:23:51,841
- And that is it?
- That is it.

557
01:23:54,209 --> 01:24:00,682
All right... we will take this into
consideration, and we will let you know.

558
01:24:13,849 --> 01:24:18,001
- Are you all right?
- Yes, it was nothing, I was nervous.

559
01:24:18,169 --> 01:24:20,239
What did they say?

560
01:24:20,409 --> 01:24:24,084
That there was
insufficient data at this time -

561
01:24:24,249 --> 01:24:29,118
- and that continued observation was
necessary for a diagnosis.

562
01:24:29,289 --> 01:24:32,599
It is a different world out there
that you may not be prepared for.

563
01:24:32,769 --> 01:24:36,921
They could not be held responsible
for what might happen to you.

564
01:24:37,089 --> 01:24:39,239
They said no.

565
01:24:44,089 --> 01:24:48,526
- And what did you say?
- They do not have to listen to me.

566
01:24:48,689 --> 01:24:50,680
Did you agree with them?

567
01:24:51,689 --> 01:24:53,805
Yes.

568
01:24:55,849 --> 01:25:01,719
I am not sure we are out of the woods yet
and that this... is nothing.

569
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:06,679
It is an experimental drug; we need
time to evaluate things before...

570
01:25:10,889 --> 01:25:14,928
- Leonard, where are you going?
- For a walk.

571
01:25:23,889 --> 01:25:25,402
This is Dr Sayer...

572
01:25:35,809 --> 01:25:38,642
- Where are you going?
- I am going outside.

573
01:25:38,809 --> 01:25:41,846
Patients are not allowed
beyond this point.

574
01:25:42,009 --> 01:25:44,887
Do not make it hard on yourself.

575
01:25:49,809 --> 01:25:51,686
I just want to go for a walk!

576
01:25:51,849 --> 01:25:55,285
He is not a mental patient,
this is unnecessary. Let him go!

577
01:25:55,449 --> 01:25:57,280
Please, he is not violent!

578
01:26:06,089 --> 01:26:10,162
I do not understand it,
he was never any trouble before.

579
01:26:10,329 --> 01:26:15,687
He was quiet, polite and respectful.
He never demanded anything.

580
01:26:15,849 --> 01:26:21,287
- He was never disobedient.
- Because he was catatonic, Mrs Lowe.

581
01:26:21,449 --> 01:26:24,043
I am speaking of when he was a boy.

582
01:26:25,249 --> 01:26:27,080
I am sorry.

583
01:26:27,529 --> 01:26:32,808
I do not know who that is up there.
I do not think he knows.

584
01:26:32,969 --> 01:26:35,961
You turned him into something he is not.

585
01:26:36,129 --> 01:26:40,600
It is not us that are defective, it is them.
We are not in crisis, they are!

586
01:26:42,289 --> 01:26:47,158
We have been through the worst
and survived it. They fear it.

587
01:26:48,169 --> 01:26:50,319
Because they know.

588
01:26:50,489 --> 01:26:52,559
They know! They know!

589
01:26:53,729 --> 01:26:57,517
Because we... remind them -

590
01:27:00,369 --> 01:27:03,441
- that there is a problem -

591
01:27:03,609 --> 01:27:05,884
- which they do not have an answer to.

592
01:27:06,049 --> 01:27:10,759
They will never be healers until they
realise this and see the problem.

593
01:27:10,929 --> 01:27:15,923
Until they admit there is a problem,
and that the problem is not us.

594
01:27:16,089 --> 01:27:20,605
We are not the problem,
they are the problem!

595
01:27:33,649 --> 01:27:36,641
He has not been able to release anger
for 30 years.

596
01:27:36,809 --> 01:27:41,280
- As the others.
- I think his behaviour is more natural.

597
01:27:41,449 --> 01:27:45,044
You think his tics and paranoia are
signs of normal behaviour?

598
01:27:45,209 --> 01:27:50,203
Yes, because he is in this place...
We wake him up and lock him in a cage.

599
01:27:50,369 --> 01:27:53,167
That is not paranoia; that is a fact.

600
01:27:53,329 --> 01:27:59,120
I have 20 psychotics refusing to eat,
who have no idea why they are doing so.

601
01:27:59,289 --> 01:28:02,725
- How long should that go on?
- He knows why. He wants out.

602
01:28:02,889 --> 01:28:08,202
Mr Lowe is not the Messiah of Ward 5.
He is a man in trouble.

603
01:28:08,369 --> 01:28:11,281
He was not resurrected,
he was given a drug by you.

604
01:28:11,449 --> 01:28:14,122
A drug which is not all that miraculous.

605
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:19,602
- The others are fine...
- He has been on it longer.

606
01:28:22,169 --> 01:28:24,603
I sympathise with him -

607
01:28:24,769 --> 01:28:29,889
- but I will not let him endanger
the health of the other patients.

608
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:43,608
- Excuse me.
- We cannot allow it.

609
01:28:43,769 --> 01:28:45,999
He is all right.

610
01:29:00,809 --> 01:29:04,358
- How are you today?
- I am all right.

611
01:29:04,929 --> 01:29:08,319
- How are you?
- Never better.

612
01:29:10,889 --> 01:29:16,725
- What is the purpose of these gentlemen?
- These gentlemen protect me.

613
01:29:16,889 --> 01:29:23,328
- I wish I did not need them.
- Someone is trying to hurt you? Who?

614
01:29:23,489 --> 01:29:27,164
That is the thing, is it not? Who?
One never knows.

615
01:29:27,329 --> 01:29:31,004
Someone I least expect.
Look at history.

616
01:29:32,369 --> 01:29:36,601
Every patient on this ward thinks
there is a plot against him.

617
01:29:36,769 --> 01:29:39,727
They are mistaken, they are crazy.

618
01:29:45,129 --> 01:29:47,643
You have got worse.

619
01:29:50,369 --> 01:29:57,002
The drug is not working. All you are
experiencing are the side effects, -

620
01:29:57,169 --> 01:29:59,205
- they make you behave this way.

621
01:29:59,369 --> 01:30:02,884
I appreciate you coming to see me,
but I have things to do.

622
01:30:03,049 --> 01:30:04,846
Please, look at yourself.

623
01:30:05,009 --> 01:30:08,399
No, look at yourself!
I have a sickness.

624
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:11,925
Sickness took me out of this world,
and I fought to get back.

625
01:30:12,089 --> 01:30:17,243
I fought for 30 years,
and I am still fighting.

626
01:30:17,369 --> 01:30:19,087
But you...

627
01:30:19,249 --> 01:30:24,528
You have no excuse, you are just a
scared and Ionely man with nothing!

628
01:30:24,689 --> 01:30:28,159
No life, nothing!
You are the one that is asleep.

629
01:30:28,329 --> 01:30:33,357
Your medicine could be taken away...
They can do that.

630
01:30:34,209 --> 01:30:38,248
You can wake up in the morning
and it will not be there.

631
01:30:43,649 --> 01:30:45,844
Get away from me!

632
01:31:01,089 --> 01:31:03,842
I am all right. Thank you.

633
01:31:04,009 --> 01:31:06,000
I just fell.

634
01:33:23,609 --> 01:33:25,520
Help me.

635
01:33:41,529 --> 01:33:43,599
Can you walk?

636
01:33:44,889 --> 01:33:49,440
I will not let them take the medicine away.
We will work together.

637
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:59,684
He has had a reaction to the drug.
He has tics.

638
01:33:59,849 --> 01:34:02,363
He is not concerned with his appearance -

639
01:34:02,529 --> 01:34:06,204
- but with how it will affect
the other patients.

640
01:34:06,369 --> 01:34:10,248
We will work on his dosage;
he is prepared for any effects.

641
01:34:10,409 --> 01:34:15,358
He wants the others to be prepared.
You have to help me with this.

642
01:34:29,729 --> 01:34:33,642
- Hi, Leonard. Welcome back.
- Thank you.

643
01:34:37,169 --> 01:34:41,208
- How are you doing?
- Are you all right?

644
01:34:44,609 --> 01:34:49,808
- It got so quiet round here.
- Because we were waiting for you.

645
01:35:02,729 --> 01:35:06,483
You are looking good, Len,
better every day.

646
01:35:12,529 --> 01:35:15,089
What if he has just had enough of it?

647
01:35:15,249 --> 01:35:19,606
What if it is just a matter of time
for all of us?

648
01:35:21,729 --> 01:35:26,644
There is no medical reason to think
what happens to him will happen to you.

649
01:35:26,809 --> 01:35:28,527
Why not?

650
01:35:29,089 --> 01:35:35,608
You are all individuals...
And you are well, are you not?

651
01:35:51,649 --> 01:35:53,879
That was lovely, Lucy.

652
01:35:54,729 --> 01:35:58,608
I learned that song a long,
long time ago.

653
01:36:02,129 --> 01:36:05,246
I know what year it is.

654
01:36:06,409 --> 01:36:10,448
I just cannot imagine being older
than twenty-two.

655
01:36:10,609 --> 01:36:13,203
I have no experience at it.

656
01:36:14,209 --> 01:36:17,599
I know it is not 1926.

657
01:36:18,969 --> 01:36:22,166
I just need it to be.

658
01:36:35,809 --> 01:36:39,848
- How are you, Leonard?
- Never better.

659
01:36:44,689 --> 01:36:48,398
How are the others?
Are they talking about me?

660
01:36:48,569 --> 01:36:52,278
- They are scared.
- They should be.

661
01:36:56,689 --> 01:37:01,126
- Can you stop this?
- I am not sure, but I am trying.

662
01:37:01,289 --> 01:37:05,805
- Do not give up on me.
- I will not.

663
01:37:16,529 --> 01:37:18,247
425, yes.

664
01:37:26,489 --> 01:37:28,445
I got a postcard from my son.

665
01:37:28,609 --> 01:37:32,966
<i>I am all right,</i>
<i>and then everything stops.</i>

666
01:37:33,129 --> 01:37:36,963
<i>There is no warning, it is like a
<i>light switch going off.</i>

667
01:37:37,129 --> 01:37:42,840
<i>Something has to bring me back.</i>
<i>A sound, a touch, -

668
01:37:43,009 --> 01:37:47,002
<i>- and then I can move again,</i>
<i>I am okay again.</i>

669
01:37:50,609 --> 01:37:55,319
<i>It is not that I feel bad,</i>
<i>it is just that I feel nothing.</i>

670
01:37:55,489 --> 01:37:59,448
<i>It is as if I am dead. Nothing.</i>

671
01:38:03,769 --> 01:38:09,207
<i>It is as if I am not a person anymore.</i>
<i>Just a collecion of tics.</i>

672
01:38:09,369 --> 01:38:14,568
<i>Not that I mind them.</i>
<i>Sometimes they make life interesting.</i>

673
01:38:14,729 --> 01:38:20,838
<i>I am not sure who is in control,</i>
<i>me or them, but they should not be there.</i>

674
01:38:22,369 --> 01:38:24,041
Up to 5.

675
01:38:32,569 --> 01:38:35,003
Just a little more...

676
01:38:37,009 --> 01:38:41,685
It feels good when I am working.
I feel good here.

677
01:38:41,849 --> 01:38:46,240
- The book list is coming along well.
- I would love to see it.

678
01:38:51,849 --> 01:38:54,317
That is all right, another time.

679
01:38:59,769 --> 01:39:03,603
- What is happening?
- You have an oculogyric crisis.

680
01:39:03,769 --> 01:39:05,521
Get the camera!

681
01:39:17,569 --> 01:39:19,958
I cannot do this...
I will turn the camera off.

682
01:39:20,129 --> 01:39:22,324
No! Watch, watch!

683
01:39:24,609 --> 01:39:30,081
Learn, learn, learn...
Learn for me.

684
01:39:32,769 --> 01:39:36,364
Let us see... 625.

685
01:39:39,649 --> 01:39:42,800
- 675, just...
- Okay.

686
01:39:59,729 --> 01:40:04,564
I cannot read anymore!
I cannot keep my eyes in one place.

687
01:40:04,729 --> 01:40:07,926
I keep going back to the beginning,
the beginning...

688
01:40:11,409 --> 01:40:14,685
- I have let everybody down.
- No.

689
01:40:14,849 --> 01:40:18,046
I have let you down.
I have, I am grotesque.

690
01:40:18,209 --> 01:40:20,928
You are not. I will not listen to this.

691
01:40:21,089 --> 01:40:24,923
I am grotesque. Look at me
and tell me I am not!

692
01:40:25,089 --> 01:40:26,568
You are not.

693
01:40:26,729 --> 01:40:29,846
This is not me!

694
01:40:44,409 --> 01:40:49,483
When my son was born healthy,
I never asked why.

695
01:40:49,649 --> 01:40:56,600
Why was I so lucky? Had I deserved
this perfect child? This perfect life?

696
01:40:57,169 --> 01:41:02,402
But when he got sick, you can bet
I asked why, I demanded to know why.

697
01:41:02,569 --> 01:41:08,565
Why was this happening?
There was nothing I could do about it.

698
01:41:09,569 --> 01:41:14,927
No one I could go to and say:
"Stop this. Please, stop this."

699
01:41:15,089 --> 01:41:18,286
"Can you not see my son is in pain?"

700
01:41:20,089 --> 01:41:23,638
My son is in pain. Please, stop this!

701
01:41:24,649 --> 01:41:28,403
- He is fighting.
- He is losing.

702
01:41:54,409 --> 01:42:01,599
I worked... had friends over,
went dancing. That is about it.

703
01:42:02,609 --> 01:42:07,285
That is great.
I have never done any of those things.

704
01:42:07,449 --> 01:42:09,565
You will.

705
01:42:11,249 --> 01:42:17,848
They will never let me out of this place
...and they should not.

706
01:42:20,569 --> 01:42:25,120
I am still not well...
as you can see.

707
01:42:31,969 --> 01:42:35,518
I feel well when I see you.

708
01:42:54,689 --> 01:42:59,717
I will not... see you anymore.

709
01:43:12,009 --> 01:43:15,001
I just want to say goodbye.

710
01:44:09,129 --> 01:44:12,599
Is that not sweet?

711
01:46:25,809 --> 01:46:29,358
<i>- Now?</i>
<i>- Whenever you are ready.</i>

712
01:46:30,489 --> 01:46:37,520
<i>My name is Leonard Lowe. I now know</i>
<i>I have been away for quite a while.</i>

713
01:46:40,049 --> 01:46:42,358
<i>I am back.</i>

714
01:46:43,289 --> 01:46:48,966
<i>- What is it like to be back?</i>
<i>- I thought it was a dream at first.</i>

715
01:46:49,129 --> 01:46:52,599
<i>When did you realise it was not?</i>

716
01:46:53,609 --> 01:46:56,248
<i>When I spoke and you understood me.</i>

717
01:47:17,369 --> 01:47:19,724
You told him I was a kind man.

718
01:47:22,609 --> 01:47:27,842
How kind is it to give life...
only to take it away again?

719
01:47:29,049 --> 01:47:33,042
It is given and taken away
from all of us.

720
01:47:34,649 --> 01:47:37,766
Why does that not comfort me?

721
01:47:38,809 --> 01:47:41,721
Because you are a kind man.

722
01:47:53,609 --> 01:47:55,998
Because he is your friend.

723
01:48:30,409 --> 01:48:37,918
<i>The summer was extraordinary. A season</i>
<i>of rebirth and innocence. A miracle.</i>

724
01:48:38,089 --> 01:48:42,844
<i>Fifteen patients and for us,</i>
<i>their caretakers.</i>

725
01:48:43,009 --> 01:48:48,037
<i>But now, we have to adjust to the</i>
<i>realities of miracles.</i>

726
01:48:48,209 --> 01:48:52,202
We can hide behind science and say
it was the drug that failed.

727
01:48:52,369 --> 01:48:55,042
Or that the illness itself had returned.

728
01:48:55,209 --> 01:49:00,727
<i>Or the patients unable to cope with</i>
<i>losing decades of their lives.</i>

729
01:49:00,889 --> 01:49:07,237
<i>The reality is... we do not know</i>
<i>what went wrong or what went right.</i>

730
01:49:07,409 --> 01:49:13,439
<i>What we do know is</i>
<i>as the chemical window closed -

731
01:49:14,449 --> 01:49:17,725
<i>- another awakening took place.</i>

732
01:49:20,649 --> 01:49:25,769
<i>That the human spirit is more powerful</i>
<i>than any drug.</i>

733
01:49:27,049 --> 01:49:30,041
<i>That is what needs to be nourished.</i>

734
01:49:31,609 --> 01:49:36,808
With work, play, friendship, family.

735
01:49:40,249 --> 01:49:43,559
These are the things that matter.

736
01:49:45,089 --> 01:49:48,081
This is what we had forgotten.

737
01:49:52,089 --> 01:49:54,557
The simplest things.

738
01:50:02,049 --> 01:50:05,758
- Well... Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

739
01:50:56,689 --> 01:50:59,283
- Eleanor?
- Yes?

740
01:51:13,769 --> 01:51:16,488
What is wrong?

741
01:51:16,649 --> 01:51:22,645
I was wondering what you are
doing tonight? If you have other plans...

742
01:51:22,809 --> 01:51:24,800
No, I was...

743
01:51:24,969 --> 01:51:28,518
- You have no plans?
- No, I have no...

744
01:51:28,689 --> 01:51:33,479
I was wondering if you... we...
you and I could...

745
01:51:35,609 --> 01:51:39,966
If we could... go for a cup of coffee?

746
01:51:40,969 --> 01:51:44,245
Yes, I would love to.

747
01:51:51,969 --> 01:51:56,918
- My car is over here.
- What do you say we just walk?

748
01:52:34,849 --> 01:52:36,999
Let us begin.
