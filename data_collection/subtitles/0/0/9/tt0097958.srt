1
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,864
"It's that time
Christmas time is here

2
00:00:24,905 --> 00:00:29,536
"Everybody knows
There's not a better time of year

3
00:00:30,545 --> 00:00:32,536
"Hear that sleigh."

4
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:57,833
"Gonna make this holiday
As perfect as can be

5
00:00:58,742 --> 00:01:02,075
"Just wait and see
This Christmas vacation.

6
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:09,179
"This old house
Sure is looking good

7
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:14,582
"Got ourselves the finest snowman
In the neighborhood.

8
00:01:16,094 --> 00:01:17,527
"Ain't it fun?

9
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,523
"Always on the run
That's how it's done

10
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:25,099
"On Christmas vacation.

11
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:28,768
"Let's all deck the halls

12
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,872
"And light the lights

13
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:34,272
"Get a toasty fire

14
00:01:34,713 --> 00:01:36,544
"Burning bright.

15
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:39,980
"Give Saint Nick

16
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:43,120
"The warmest welcome
That he's ever had

17
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:47,291
"We're so glad it's Christmas vacation.

18
00:01:49,896 --> 00:01:51,557
"And when the nights

19
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:54,498
"Are peaceful and serene

20
00:01:56,136 --> 00:02:00,801
"We can cuddle up
And do our Christmas dreamin'.

21
00:02:03,744 --> 00:02:05,541
"Peace and joy and love

22
00:02:05,613 --> 00:02:07,444
"Are everywhere

23
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:12,081
"You can feel the magic in the air.

24
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:19,223
"Let the spirit of the season
Carry us away

25
00:02:20,996 --> 00:02:23,658
"Hip, hip, hooray
For Christmas vacation."

26
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,643
That was beautiful, honey.

27
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:31,395
Take it, Russ.

28
00:03:34,575 --> 00:03:37,100
Dad, can you explain again
what we're doing?

29
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:40,911
We're kicking off our fun,
old-fashioned family Christmas...

30
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:44,446
...by heading out to the country
in the front-wheel drive sleigh...

31
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:47,578
...to embrace the frosty majesty
of the winter landscape...

32
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:50,755
...and select that most important
of Christmas symbols.

33
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:54,553
We're not driving way out here
so you can get one of those stupid ties...

34
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:56,859
...with the Santa Clauses on it,
are we, Dad?

35
00:03:57,165 --> 00:03:59,065
No, I have one of those at home.

36
00:03:59,601 --> 00:04:03,264
What we're looking for today
is the Griswold family Christmas tree.

37
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:16,143
- What's the matter?
- Some jackass is riding my tail.

38
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:21,356
Slow down and let him pass.

39
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:36,395
Don't provoke them.

40
00:04:37,341 --> 00:04:38,968
Hey, kids. Look, a deer!

41
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:01,330
Clark! Slow down!

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,525
You want to ride behind
somebody like that?

43
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:08,501
I'm going to pull around them...
burn some dust, here.

44
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,407
Eat my rubber.

45
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,012
Dad, I think what you mean is,
"Burn rubber" and "Eat my dust."

46
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,339
Whatever, Russ.

47
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,016
Eat my road grit, liver lips!

48
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,595
That's enough of that.

49
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,901
Speaking of Christmas trees,
can one of you tell me...

50
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:40,998
...what the first kind of tree
displayed at the White House was?

51
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:42,065
They're back.

52
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:50,383
Stop it! I don't want to spend
the holidays dead.

53
00:05:51,252 --> 00:05:53,778
Honey, please. I'll do the driving, okay?

54
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,914
Will you just take it easy?

55
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,055
I'm in complete control.

56
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:01,393
I'll get around this egg timer.

57
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,159
Uh... Dad?!

58
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:19,982
We're all right! Thank God!

59
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:22,344
Clark, we're stuck under a truck!

60
00:06:22,552 --> 00:06:24,418
Do you honestly think I don't know that?!

61
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:26,320
Come on, you guys. Don't fight.

62
00:06:26,457 --> 00:06:28,789
For Christ's sake,
I didn't do this on purpose.

63
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:34,291
Our Father, who art in heaven...

64
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:38,035
...hallowed be Thy name.
And forgive my husband.

65
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:41,100
- He knows not what he does.
- Amen!

66
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:00,954
We made pretty good time.

67
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:10,802
Dad, didn't they invent
Christmas tree lots...

68
00:07:10,905 --> 00:07:15,035
...so people don't have to drive way out
to nowhere and waste a Saturday?

69
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,374
They invented 'em...

70
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:19,880
...because people forgot how to have
a fun, old-fashioned family Christmas.

71
00:07:19,947 --> 00:07:24,077
They're satisfied with scrawny, dead,
overpriced trees with no special meaning.

72
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:25,083
My toes are numb.

73
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:27,178
This is what our forefathers did.

74
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:29,254
I can't feel my leg.

75
00:07:29,424 --> 00:07:31,858
They walked out into the woods,
picked out that special tree...

76
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:33,360
...and they cut it down
with their bare hands.

77
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:35,328
Mom, I can't feel my hips.

78
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:36,921
- Clark?
- Yes, honey?

79
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:39,499
Audrey's frozen from the waist down.

80
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:41,696
That's all part of the experience, honey.

81
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:44,770
There it is.

82
00:08:04,094 --> 00:08:06,119
The Griswold family Christmas tree.

83
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:14,137
Isn't it a little big?

84
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:17,138
It's not big, it's just full.

85
00:08:17,742 --> 00:08:19,903
That thing wouldn't fit in our yard.

86
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,406
It's not going in our yard, Russ.
It's going in our living room.

87
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:32,049
- Look at it.
- It really is beautiful, Clark.

88
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:35,224
- It's something else, huh, Russ?
- Yeah, Dad.

89
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:36,655
Isn't it a beaut, Audrey?

90
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:38,285
She'll see it later, honey.

91
00:08:38,697 --> 00:08:39,925
Her eyes are frozen.

92
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:43,834
The most enduring traditions
of the season are best enjoyed in...

93
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:46,600
...the warm embrace of kith and kin.

94
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,602
This tree is a symbol of the spirit
of the Griswold family Christmas.

95
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,604
Did you bring a saw?

96
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:44,463
Looks like the toad overestimated
the height of his ceiling.

97
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:57,272
Hey, Griswold!

98
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:00,016
Where will you put a tree that big?

99
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:03,582
Bend over and I'll show you.

100
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:07,154
You got a lot of nerve
talking to me like that.

101
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:08,953
I wasn't talking to you.

102
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:28,546
Do you think there's
enough room for the angel?

103
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:33,013
Sure, honey. I have a little more trimming
to do, but that won't be a problem.

104
00:10:33,286 --> 00:10:34,116
Ready?

105
00:10:34,788 --> 00:10:37,689
I give you
the Griswold family Christmas tree.

106
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:47,867
There's a lot of sap in here.

107
00:10:50,204 --> 00:10:52,672
It looks great. A little full.
A lot of sap.

108
00:11:15,164 --> 00:11:17,394
Did I tell you I talked to my mother today?

109
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:21,565
They've decided they're coming
for Christmas, too.

110
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:24,196
It's not too late to change our plans...

111
00:11:24,274 --> 00:11:25,866
No, no, that's great.

112
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:30,270
I think you're forgetting
how difficult it's gonna be...

113
00:11:30,346 --> 00:11:32,780
...having everybody in the house
at the same time.

114
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:35,611
They're family,
not strangers off the street.

115
00:11:35,886 --> 00:11:37,513
All they do is argue.

116
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:40,724
Christmas is about resolving differences...

117
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,555
...and seeing through
the petty problems of family life.

118
00:11:43,627 --> 00:11:47,620
And it's about my mother accusing
your mother of buying cheap hot dogs.

119
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:52,293
And your mother accusing my mother
of waxing her upper lip, and...

120
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:55,165
...then they don't speak to...
- Your mother waxes her upper lip?

121
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,901
She has for years.

122
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,740
It doesn't show.

123
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:02,771
I don't know, Sparky,
I just have this feeling it's not...

124
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,147
I want to have Christmas here,
in our house.

125
00:12:05,752 --> 00:12:07,014
It means a lot to me.

126
00:12:07,386 --> 00:12:10,549
All my life I've wanted to have
a big family Christmas.

127
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:17,651
It's just that you build things up
in your mind, Sparky.

128
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:22,962
You set standards no family event
can ever live up to.

129
00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:25,761
When have I ever done that?

130
00:12:29,443 --> 00:12:30,467
Parties.

131
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:32,670
Weddings.

132
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:35,446
- Good night, honey.
- Anniversaries.

133
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:37,176
Funerals.

134
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:39,677
Holidays.

135
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:41,319
Vacations.

136
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:42,986
Graduations.

137
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:09,147
Guess you'll be lookin' at
a nice fat Christmas bonus this year, huh?

138
00:13:09,219 --> 00:13:11,050
Word is you're an excellent choice
to be named...

139
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:12,918
...Food Additive Designer of the Year.

140
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:15,184
- Nah...
- I'm not kidding.

141
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:17,992
What's that new thing you got
over there at Food 'N' Dry?

142
00:13:18,061 --> 00:13:21,792
The crunch enhancer?
That's a non-nutritive cereal varnish.

143
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:23,458
It's semi-permeable. It's not osmotic.

144
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:25,263
What it does is,
it coats and seals the flake.

145
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:26,735
It prevents the milk from penetrating it.

146
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:29,068
Yeah, it's a beautiful product.

147
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:30,001
I like it.

148
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:32,575
What are you gonna do
with that big bonus check?

149
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:34,008
You're gonna blow it on yourself, I hope.

150
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:35,375
Me? Heck, no.

151
00:13:36,414 --> 00:13:37,905
Take a look at this.

152
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,051
I just hope my Christmas bonus check
will cover it.

153
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:47,785
Oh, my God. You're putting in a pool.

154
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,936
I went ahead and I put
a $7,500 deposit down on it.

155
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,199
You're the last true family man.

156
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:05,739
Mark.

157
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:07,845
Clark.

158
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,739
That's Bill, sir.

159
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:14,348
Are you the one who's working
on that non-nutritive cereal varnish?

160
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:15,285
Yes, sir.

161
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:18,687
I've got to give a speech to a trade group.
I'd like to mention it.

162
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,922
Write up a brief summary
and have it to me by the end of the day.

163
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:23,020
My pleasure.

164
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:27,429
Layman's terms. None of that inside,
bullshit jargon that nobody understands.

165
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:29,097
Yes, sir.

166
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:33,965
Oh, Mr. Shirley...

167
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:36,276
We got your Christmas card
the other day, and...

168
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:39,610
...my family and I are very flattered
that you remembered us.

169
00:14:40,216 --> 00:14:41,342
Corporate cards.

170
00:14:45,922 --> 00:14:47,480
Don't forget that report, Bill.

171
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:49,080
Yes, sir. Merry Christmas.

172
00:14:51,294 --> 00:14:54,889
Merry Christmas. Kiss my ass.
Kiss his ass. Kiss your ass.

173
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:56,493
Happy Hanukkah.

174
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:24,356
Can I show you something?

175
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:34,165
I was just smelling... smiling.

176
00:15:35,474 --> 00:15:36,964
I was blouse... browsing.

177
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:40,234
For your wife or girlfriend?

178
00:15:42,248 --> 00:15:44,011
What? What happened?

179
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:52,557
I guess it wouldn't be any...

180
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:55,551
It wouldn't be
the Christmas shopping season...

181
00:15:55,628 --> 00:15:59,224
...if the stores were any less hooter
than they... Hotter than they are.

182
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:01,427
It is warm in here.

183
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,696
- When you have your coat on.
- Do I?

184
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:06,066
- How did that happen?
- Because it's cold out.

185
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,233
Yes. Yes.

186
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:11,142
It is. It's a bit nipply out.
I mean, nippy out.

187
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:13,442
What am I saying? Nipple?

188
00:16:14,282 --> 00:16:16,443
There is a nip in the air, though.

189
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:18,644
Can I take something out for you?

190
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:29,492
I was just, uh...

191
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,800
I was looking at something for my wife.

192
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:34,468
God rest her soul.

193
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,262
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

194
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:39,739
Oh, no, no, she's not dead, yet.
We're just divorced.

195
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,807
She's history.

196
00:16:41,878 --> 00:16:43,676
Obviously, she doesn't wear underwear...

197
00:16:43,747 --> 00:16:48,116
...there are plenty of shopping days
left until adultery... adulthood.

198
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:51,688
Which is to say, Christmas,
as in Yule. Yule log.

199
00:16:52,022 --> 00:16:55,014
Not a log. I don't have a log, but I mean,
you know...

200
00:16:55,092 --> 00:16:58,391
...if I had a log. Not in the sense
you think I said I did.

201
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:01,324
Good golly.

202
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:04,098
'Tis the season to be merry.

203
00:17:04,335 --> 00:17:05,563
Well, that's my name.

204
00:17:05,637 --> 00:17:06,797
No shit.

205
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:25,050
These are cut really high on the hip.

206
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:28,685
Look, I'm wearing something similar.
See? You can't see the line.

207
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:31,888
- You can't see the line, can you, Russ?
- No.

208
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:43,403
Look, Daddy, teacher says
every time a bell rings...

209
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:45,805
...an angel gets his wings.

210
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:20,711
Folks!

211
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,511
Merry Christmas.

212
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:34,594
Look how big you've gotten.

213
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,693
Merry Christmas.

214
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,365
Mom.

215
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:40,359
Knock on the door.

216
00:18:43,641 --> 00:18:45,233
Doesn't Nora look old?

217
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:46,866
You promised, you promised...

218
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:49,072
They took a pint of fluid
out of my lower back.

219
00:18:49,147 --> 00:18:52,480
You see this mole? This mole on my neck?
You think it's changing color?

220
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:54,985
No. You keep touching it.
It's getting redder.

221
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:56,418
I got hemorrhoids.

222
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:57,486
Could you believe that?

223
00:18:57,556 --> 00:18:59,353
- Oh, Mother.
- Isn't that terrible?

224
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:02,083
- You're not getting the space...
- After what you did to my car?

225
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,322
I'm doing the parking.
Come and help me with the...

226
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:07,525
Mom, they're not sleeping in my room.
I'm gonna go crazy...

227
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,001
Sweetheart, your grandma Nora's got
a real painful burr on her heel.

228
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,470
If you rub it for me,
I'll give you a quarter.

229
00:19:13,573 --> 00:19:16,406
- A quarter.
- And I'll give Audrey a quarter, too.

230
00:19:16,475 --> 00:19:19,104
I'm going to put my car in the garage!

231
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:21,079
I'll park the cars.

232
00:19:22,482 --> 00:19:24,848
This is what Christmas is all about.

233
00:19:25,652 --> 00:19:29,645
I'll park the cars
and check the luggage, and...

234
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,422
I'll be outside for the season.

235
00:19:36,097 --> 00:19:38,622
We'll have the best-looking house in town.

236
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,531
I've always wanted to do this.

237
00:19:40,602 --> 00:19:42,331
That's a lot of lights, Dad.

238
00:19:42,403 --> 00:19:45,338
I'm sure it's a lot of work,
but if I'm out in the cold...

239
00:19:45,406 --> 00:19:47,636
...and I'm committed
to decorating the house...

240
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:50,543
...l'm gonna do it right
and I'm gonna do it big.

241
00:19:51,447 --> 00:19:54,143
You want something
you can be proud of, don't you?

242
00:19:54,216 --> 00:19:55,615
Yeah, I guess so.

243
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:57,612
Sure you do.

244
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,454
You think you might be overdoing it, Dad?

245
00:20:00,522 --> 00:20:03,889
Russ, when was the last time
I overdid anything?

246
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,021
Come on, unravel these.

247
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,165
You have to check every bulb.

248
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:14,897
A little knot here. You work on that.

249
00:20:16,806 --> 00:20:18,831
I'll get the other box.

250
00:20:31,656 --> 00:20:33,681
I hope he falls and breaks his neck.

251
00:20:33,758 --> 00:20:38,389
I'm sure he'll fall. But I don't think we're
lucky enough to have him break his neck.

252
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,163
Let's go.

253
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:14,365
These gusty winds appear to be playing
havoc with the giant nutcracker float.

254
00:21:14,601 --> 00:21:18,560
At this point, I can't even see the nuts.
They must have blown away.

255
00:21:18,972 --> 00:21:23,239
But nothing is going to dampen the spirit
of this holiday crowd, I can tell you that.

256
00:21:23,311 --> 00:21:25,802
Oh, here they are. Here come the nuts.

257
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:46,662
Would it be indecent
to ask the grandparents to stay at a hotel?

258
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:50,699
Can we at least forbid them
to answer the phone?

259
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,534
Alexander called this morning
and Grandpa Clark told him...

260
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,838
...I couldn't come to the phone
'cause I was going to the bathroom.

261
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:59,072
We're all making sacrifices, Audrey.

262
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:00,311
Everybody?

263
00:23:00,381 --> 00:23:04,408
Do you sleep with your brother? Do you
know how sick and twisted that is?

264
00:23:04,485 --> 00:23:08,649
I'm sleeping with your father.
Don't be so dramatic.

265
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:13,593
I have nightmares about what he does in
bed alone when I'm not lying next to him.

266
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:17,162
I don't know what to say
except it's Christmas...

267
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,430
...and we're all in misery.

268
00:23:20,335 --> 00:23:22,895
Ellen, are you smoking again?

269
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:25,238
No!

270
00:23:36,486 --> 00:23:38,954
Dad, where do you want these reindeer?

271
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:41,450
Just put them on the lawn, Russ.

272
00:23:43,694 --> 00:23:45,594
I can't find the Santa Claus.

273
00:23:46,864 --> 00:23:49,765
It's in the basement. We'll get it later.

274
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,092
Clark? Dinner's ready.

275
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:51,326
Okay, honey. I'm starving.

276
00:25:10,452 --> 00:25:14,821
Obviously something broke the window.
Something hit the stereo.

277
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:27,229
And why is the carpet all wet, Todd?

278
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,736
I don't know, Margo.

279
00:25:37,648 --> 00:25:40,811
You wanna hurry this up, Clark?
I'm freezing my baguettes off.

280
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:45,184
Two hundred and fifty strands of lights,
100 individual bulbs per strand...

281
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:49,185
...for a grand total of 25,000
imported Italian twinkle lights.

282
00:25:51,596 --> 00:25:52,756
Twenty-five thousand.

283
00:25:52,897 --> 00:25:55,092
I hope nobody I know drives by...

284
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:58,895
...and sees me standing in the yard,
staring at my house in my pajamas.

285
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,099
If they know your dad,
they won't think anything of it.

286
00:26:02,174 --> 00:26:03,664
Fire it up!

287
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,108
I dedicate this house
to the Griswold family Christmas.

288
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:13,683
Drum roll, please.

289
00:26:16,322 --> 00:26:17,347
Drum roll.

290
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:35,803
"Joy to the world."

291
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,592
Beautiful, Clark.

292
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:54,722
Talk about pissing your money away.

293
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:59,967
I hope you kids see what a silly waste
of resources this was.

294
00:27:00,235 --> 00:27:02,226
He worked really hard, Grandma.

295
00:27:02,471 --> 00:27:04,235
So do washing machines.

296
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:11,079
Let's get in where it's warm.

297
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:16,412
Clark, baby, I can picture it
in my mind and it's breathtaking.

298
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,050
Thanks, Mom.

299
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:26,787
It's probably a bad bulb. You know, if
one goes out, the whole thing won't work.

300
00:27:27,031 --> 00:27:30,194
If I were you,
I'd personally check each one.

301
00:27:30,434 --> 00:27:31,765
I did that, Dad.

302
00:27:32,002 --> 00:27:35,871
If you need any help, give me a holler.
I'll be upstairs asleep.

303
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:42,277
I'm sorry, Daddy. It looks good,
even if they're not lit.

304
00:27:43,882 --> 00:27:45,474
Thank you, sweetheart.

305
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:54,620
Well, Dad, it was a good try.

306
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:56,292
Thanks, Russ.

307
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:01,331
We checked every bulb, didn't we?

308
00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:05,230
I'm sure of it.

309
00:28:08,342 --> 00:28:10,333
Maybe we ought to go up there and just...

310
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,139
Geez! Look at the time.

311
00:28:13,046 --> 00:28:14,536
I have to go to bed.

312
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:16,948
Brush my teeth, feed the hog.

313
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:21,283
I still got some homework to do,
do the laundry, wash the car...

314
00:28:27,262 --> 00:28:29,321
Don't stay up too late.

315
00:28:50,853 --> 00:28:53,220
Get off me, you little fungus.

316
00:30:54,418 --> 00:30:56,910
Where the hell is that cold coming from?

317
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:22,937
- I need just a few more...
- Pay by check, if you can.

318
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:26,441
- Not a card?
- No, it's a hassle if you have to return.

319
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,290
Help!

320
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:36,625
Daddy. Is Clark coming?

321
00:31:36,696 --> 00:31:37,958
How the hell would I know?

322
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:38,998
Is he in the house?

323
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:41,966
If he's not farting around
with the lights, he must be.

324
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:44,903
I'm sure he wants to come shopping
and have lunch with us.

325
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:49,875
He's got another car. He can drive.
I have to eat so I can take my back pill.

326
00:35:52,102 --> 00:35:54,866
I want to take off these clothes,
sit with a glass of wine...

327
00:35:54,938 --> 00:35:56,872
...and kiss every inch of your body.

328
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,773
- After you shower, of course.
- Of course.

329
00:36:16,127 --> 00:36:18,561
- Sparky?
- Yes, honey.

330
00:36:27,606 --> 00:36:31,064
Are you out here for a reason,
or are you just avoiding the family?

331
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,243
I still have a couple hundred
more bulbs to check.

332
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,081
Meantime, I can light the Santa...

333
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,415
...and the eight tiny reindeer
and the "Merry Christmas" sign.

334
00:36:40,486 --> 00:36:42,977
That should look good. Ready?

335
00:36:43,256 --> 00:36:44,917
Want me to do the drum roll thing?

336
00:36:44,991 --> 00:36:47,084
No, it's okay. Here goes nothing.

337
00:36:54,835 --> 00:36:56,462
I don't understand it.

338
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:01,403
The house lights don't work,
the floodlights don't work.

339
00:37:03,677 --> 00:37:05,167
Is it plugged in?

340
00:37:05,512 --> 00:37:08,346
Do you think I would check
thousands of tiny lights...

341
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:11,476
...if I wasn't sure
the extension cord was plugged in?

342
00:37:13,355 --> 00:37:15,846
You used more than one cord, didn't you?

343
00:37:18,193 --> 00:37:22,061
Maybe the kids have been fooling around
with it. I'll check in the back.

344
00:37:42,986 --> 00:37:43,953
Clark!

345
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,285
- Todd!
- Sorry!

346
00:37:51,928 --> 00:37:54,328
Honey, I think I know what's wrong.

347
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:11,075
I can't see!

348
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:31,168
This ought to do it.

349
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:45,908
I fixed it!

350
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:52,290
Everybody! Come out quick!
Look at the lights!

351
00:39:01,336 --> 00:39:03,304
- Get a towel.
- Okay!

352
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:08,805
Wait a minute! I don't believe this.

353
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:11,175
What's all that yelling about?

354
00:39:12,982 --> 00:39:14,574
What's going on here?!

355
00:39:16,652 --> 00:39:18,483
Twenty-five thousand twinkle lights.

356
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:21,813
What's he doing?

357
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:23,685
I haven't the foggiest.

358
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:27,488
What the hell?!

359
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,291
What is wrong with this?!

360
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,560
Damn it!

361
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,641
You goddamn thing!

362
00:40:12,545 --> 00:40:14,104
Dad, it's beautiful!

363
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:31,964
Oh, my carpet!

364
00:40:41,642 --> 00:40:43,576
Clark, it's so lovely.

365
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:49,748
You deserve a home like this
to spend Christmas in.

366
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:55,412
It's a beaut, Clark. A beaut.

367
00:40:57,593 --> 00:41:00,586
You taught me everything I know
about exterior illumination.

368
00:41:00,663 --> 00:41:02,426
Thank you, thank you.

369
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:05,065
Russ. Audrey.

370
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:11,771
Dear... Francis.

371
00:41:14,611 --> 00:41:17,445
I hope this adds
to your enjoyment of the holidays.

372
00:41:17,781 --> 00:41:19,772
It's just wonderful.

373
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:23,279
Arthur.

374
00:41:24,288 --> 00:41:25,277
Art.

375
00:41:26,957 --> 00:41:28,117
Dad.

376
00:41:28,626 --> 00:41:30,184
Thanks for being here.

377
00:41:30,461 --> 00:41:32,896
The little lights are not twinkling.

378
00:41:32,964 --> 00:41:35,626
I know, Art, and thanks for noticing.

379
00:41:40,138 --> 00:41:42,629
The house sure does look swell, Clark.

380
00:41:42,707 --> 00:41:44,038
Thanks, Eddie.

381
00:41:44,476 --> 00:41:48,641
I hope it enhances your holiday spirit.
Dear Catherine.

382
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:50,608
Eddie?

383
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,375
The house is gorgeous, Clark.

384
00:41:55,488 --> 00:41:56,648
Eddie?

385
00:41:57,156 --> 00:42:00,148
I hope you didn't do this
all on our account, Clark.

386
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:04,089
Kids, come on out here and see
what Uncle Clark's done to the house.

387
00:42:04,164 --> 00:42:05,222
Eddie?

388
00:42:12,673 --> 00:42:13,640
Eddie?

389
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:19,503
If you don't remember, this here is Rocky.

390
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:24,184
- Have you got a kiss for me?
- Take a rain check on that, Art.

391
00:42:24,252 --> 00:42:27,085
He's got a lip fungus
that ain't identified yet.

392
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:31,782
You remember Ruby Sue?

393
00:42:34,196 --> 00:42:36,027
Oh, my gosh!

394
00:42:37,866 --> 00:42:39,663
Her eyes are not crossed anymore.

395
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:41,202
That somethin', ain't it?

396
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,363
She falls in a well, her eyes go cross.

397
00:42:43,439 --> 00:42:46,875
A mule kicks her, they go back to normal.
I don't know.

398
00:42:50,547 --> 00:42:52,708
And this here is our pride and joy.

399
00:42:52,782 --> 00:42:54,215
Snots.

400
00:42:55,118 --> 00:42:56,278
Pretty name.

401
00:42:56,386 --> 00:42:59,446
We named him that
'cause he's got this sinus condition.

402
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,556
Snots, you roll over
and let Uncle Clark scratch your belly.

403
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:09,063
You never seen a set on a dog
like this one's got, Clark.

404
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,527
That's okay, Eddie.

405
00:43:11,902 --> 00:43:14,564
That's somethin', ain't it?
You pet him on the belly...

406
00:43:14,638 --> 00:43:16,833
...and he'll love you till the day you die.

407
00:43:16,907 --> 00:43:19,501
I really shouldn't.
My hands are all chapped.

408
00:43:20,078 --> 00:43:24,742
We were going to call,
but Eddie wanted to make it a surprise.

409
00:43:24,983 --> 00:43:26,314
You surprised?

410
00:43:26,585 --> 00:43:27,609
Surprised, Eddie?

411
00:43:27,919 --> 00:43:30,217
If I woke up tomorrow
with my head sewn to the carpet...

412
00:43:30,388 --> 00:43:32,822
...I wouldn't be more surprised
than I am right now.

413
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:37,085
We have plenty of room.

414
00:43:39,265 --> 00:43:42,826
Plenty of towels. Plenty of everything.

415
00:43:44,437 --> 00:43:48,430
We're pretty well set up here in the RV.
It's a little tight but...

416
00:43:49,008 --> 00:43:50,532
...we didn't come to impose.

417
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,442
There's plenty of room.

418
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,939
Quit being so damn polite, Ed.

419
00:43:55,749 --> 00:44:01,016
Catherine and I are pretty comfy in there,
but maybe you folks wouldn't mind...

420
00:44:01,088 --> 00:44:02,783
...the youngsters shacking up with you.

421
00:44:02,856 --> 00:44:04,687
After that long drive...

422
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:07,455
...we could use
a little private time together.

423
00:44:08,296 --> 00:44:13,563
Honey, why don't you get the kids' things.
Don't forget the rubber sheets and gerbils.

424
00:44:13,635 --> 00:44:15,466
I'll show you the home.

425
00:44:53,578 --> 00:44:55,569
That's a honey of a tree, Clark.

426
00:44:56,514 --> 00:44:57,674
Is it real?

427
00:44:58,683 --> 00:45:00,446
I dug it out of the ground myself.

428
00:45:00,518 --> 00:45:01,849
Is that a fact?

429
00:45:02,353 --> 00:45:04,048
Get out of there, Snots!

430
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:05,110
Don't worry about it.

431
00:45:05,189 --> 00:45:07,714
A little tree water ain't gonna hurt him.

432
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:10,795
Before we left, he drank
a half a quart of Pennzoil.

433
00:45:10,863 --> 00:45:13,696
He lifted his leg the next mornin'...

434
00:45:16,068 --> 00:45:18,935
If he drinks the water out of there,
the tree's gonna dry up.

435
00:45:19,004 --> 00:45:20,699
Come on out of there.

436
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,535
Get out of there. Go in the kitchen
and get something to eat.

437
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,975
He's cute, ain't he?

438
00:45:29,048 --> 00:45:32,950
Only problem is, he's got
a little bit of Mississippi leg hound in him.

439
00:45:33,219 --> 00:45:37,451
If the mood catches him right,
he'll grab your leg and just go to town.

440
00:45:38,725 --> 00:45:42,560
You don't want him around
if you're wearing short pants.

441
00:45:43,731 --> 00:45:45,221
A word of warning, though.

442
00:45:45,299 --> 00:45:48,530
If he does lay into you,
it's best to just let him finish.

443
00:45:51,238 --> 00:45:54,833
I can't believe you're actually
standing here in my living room, Eddie.

444
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:56,577
Never thought the day would come.

445
00:45:56,645 --> 00:45:58,476
I'm excited about it, too.

446
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:02,414
It's a cryin' shame
the older kids couldn't make it.

447
00:46:06,154 --> 00:46:08,588
I'll get that.
Don't worry about it. It's okay.

448
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:17,093
I got the daughter in the clinic
getting cured off the Wild Turkey.

449
00:46:18,034 --> 00:46:21,834
The older boy, bless his soul,
is preparing for his career.

450
00:46:22,438 --> 00:46:23,996
- College?
- Carnival.

451
00:46:25,107 --> 00:46:26,370
You gotta be proud.

452
00:46:27,945 --> 00:46:32,143
Last season, he was a pixie dust spreader
on the Tilt-O-Whirl.

453
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:35,612
He thinks that maybe next year,
he'll be guessing people's weight...

454
00:46:35,686 --> 00:46:37,745
...or barking for the Yak Woman.

455
00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:41,223
- You ever see her?
- No.

456
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:44,625
She got these big horns
growing right out above her ears.

457
00:46:44,862 --> 00:46:47,353
She's ugly as sin, but a sweet gal.

458
00:46:47,432 --> 00:46:48,626
And a hell of a good cook.

459
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,396
Can I refill your eggnog for you?
Get you something to eat?

460
00:46:51,469 --> 00:46:53,960
Drive you out to the middle of nowhere
and leave you for dead?

461
00:46:54,038 --> 00:46:56,199
No, I'm doing just fine.

462
00:46:56,774 --> 00:46:58,140
Just glad to be here.

463
00:46:59,812 --> 00:47:02,474
When did you get
the tenement on wheels?

464
00:47:03,315 --> 00:47:06,148
Oh, that? That's an RV.

465
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:09,314
I borrowed it off a buddy of mine.

466
00:47:09,388 --> 00:47:12,221
He took my house, I took the RV.

467
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:15,150
It's a good-looking vehicle, ain't it?

468
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:17,763
It looks so nice parked in the driveway.

469
00:47:17,831 --> 00:47:21,164
It sure does.
Don't you go falling in love with it.

470
00:47:21,901 --> 00:47:24,995
We're taking it with us
when we leave here next month.

471
00:47:34,849 --> 00:47:37,682
Get Ed Leftic up here
to look over these figures!

472
00:47:38,252 --> 00:47:40,413
Retooling. That's a great excuse.

473
00:47:42,523 --> 00:47:44,856
Retooling?! I'll retool you!

474
00:47:47,863 --> 00:47:49,854
Mr. Shirley, Merry Christmas.

475
00:47:50,265 --> 00:47:51,527
Who's that?

476
00:47:52,467 --> 00:47:54,128
It's me, Clark Griswold.

477
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:55,768
What do you want?

478
00:47:56,872 --> 00:48:01,207
My wife and I just came up with
a little something special. It's a gift.

479
00:48:02,278 --> 00:48:04,872
Put it over there
with the others, Greaseball.

480
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:20,019
By the way, I hope my report helped out
at the trade show.

481
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,893
I'm sure it did, Grisball.

482
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:30,972
If you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of an important call.

483
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,275
Get me somebody.

484
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,639
Anybody.

485
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:38,008
And get me somebody while I'm waiting.

486
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:55,160
This is a new non-caloric,
silicon-based kitchen lubricant...

487
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:56,598
...my company's been working on.

488
00:48:56,669 --> 00:49:00,366
It creates a surface 500 times
more slippery than cooking oil.

489
00:49:00,439 --> 00:49:02,874
We'll fly down the hill with this stuff.

490
00:49:03,276 --> 00:49:05,335
Has anyone ever used it on a sled?

491
00:49:05,412 --> 00:49:06,879
Not that I know of.

492
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:12,441
Don't go puttin' none of that stuff
on my sled, Clark.

493
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:16,119
- You know the metal plate in my head?
- How could I forget it.

494
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:20,124
I had it replaced. Every time
Catherine raved up the microwave...

495
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:23,094
...l'd piss in my pants
and forget who I was.

496
00:49:23,464 --> 00:49:26,365
Over at the V.A., they had it replaced
with a plastic one.

497
00:49:26,634 --> 00:49:28,625
That ain't as strong, so...

498
00:49:29,137 --> 00:49:31,298
I shouldn't go sailing down a hill...

499
00:49:31,372 --> 00:49:33,637
...with nothing between
the ground and my brain...

500
00:49:33,709 --> 00:49:35,939
...but a piece of government plastic.

501
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:39,242
You really think it matters, Eddie?

502
00:49:39,314 --> 00:49:42,147
The plate runs right underneath my part.

503
00:49:44,153 --> 00:49:46,485
Over here is nothing, but...

504
00:49:46,822 --> 00:49:51,658
...if this gets dented,
then my hair just ain't going to look right.

505
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,797
I know the feeling.

506
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:59,635
I better try this first. See how it works.

507
00:49:59,702 --> 00:50:01,533
Be careful there, Clark.

508
00:50:01,604 --> 00:50:03,539
Nothing to worry about, Eddie.

509
00:50:03,674 --> 00:50:08,077
Going for a new, amateur-recreational-
saucer-sled land-speed record...

510
00:50:08,512 --> 00:50:11,003
Clark W. Griswold, Junior!

511
00:50:11,682 --> 00:50:15,015
Remember, don't try this at home, kids.
I am a professional.

512
00:50:18,189 --> 00:50:19,521
Later, dudes.

513
00:50:20,859 --> 00:50:22,850
Let her rip. Hang ten.

514
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,013
It's great! I'm dead!

515
00:51:28,264 --> 00:51:29,424
Bingo.

516
00:51:42,445 --> 00:51:44,379
- You're staying late?
- Hi, Bill.

517
00:51:44,447 --> 00:51:45,778
Yeah. Just...

518
00:51:46,449 --> 00:51:49,941
...finishing up a few things.
Last day of the year for me.

519
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:53,454
Have a really Merry Christmas.

520
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:55,850
You, too.

521
00:51:58,362 --> 00:51:59,488
You okay?

522
00:52:00,564 --> 00:52:01,553
Yeah.

523
00:52:03,301 --> 00:52:05,792
Bill, did you get your bonus yet?

524
00:52:06,137 --> 00:52:08,038
Just talked to my son.

525
00:52:08,407 --> 00:52:11,240
Company messenger just brought
something to my house.

526
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:14,110
Nothing like waiting
till the last minute, huh?

527
00:52:15,314 --> 00:52:16,576
You get yours?

528
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,346
If it isn't at the house,
I'm sure it must be on its way.

529
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,255
If I don't get that bonus,
I'm in it up to here.

530
00:52:25,658 --> 00:52:27,421
Don't sweat it. It'll come.

531
00:52:27,493 --> 00:52:28,755
Merry Christmas.

532
00:52:28,828 --> 00:52:30,056
Same to you.

533
00:52:50,184 --> 00:52:54,019
"'Mele Kalikimaka' is the thing to say

534
00:52:54,689 --> 00:52:56,680
"On a bright Hawaiian

535
00:52:56,925 --> 00:52:58,586
"Christmas day.

536
00:52:59,694 --> 00:53:01,855
"That's the island greeting

537
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:05,090
"That we send to you
From the land

538
00:53:05,867 --> 00:53:08,199
"Where palm trees sway.

539
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:11,162
"Here we know that Christmas

540
00:53:11,407 --> 00:53:13,136
"Will be green and bright

541
00:53:13,609 --> 00:53:15,873
"The sun to shine by day

542
00:53:16,045 --> 00:53:18,036
"And all the stars at night.

543
00:53:18,447 --> 00:53:22,611
"'Mele Kalikimaka' is Hawaii's way

544
00:53:22,952 --> 00:53:26,116
"To say 'Merry Christmas' to you."

545
00:54:41,368 --> 00:54:42,700
Santy Claus?

546
00:54:43,805 --> 00:54:46,137
Uncle Clark, are you Santy Claus?

547
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,272
What?

548
00:54:51,146 --> 00:54:52,636
What? You scared me.

549
00:54:54,716 --> 00:54:56,650
No, I'm not Santa Claus.

550
00:55:00,156 --> 00:55:01,384
I wish I was.

551
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:05,786
What are you doing up, sweetheart?

552
00:55:07,497 --> 00:55:09,158
Rocky bit my thumb.

553
00:55:09,832 --> 00:55:12,665
Him's nervous
because Christmas is almost here.

554
00:55:13,837 --> 00:55:15,304
Nervous or excited?

555
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,170
Shittin' bricks.

556
00:55:18,509 --> 00:55:19,999
You shouldn't use that word.

557
00:55:20,077 --> 00:55:22,568
Sorry. Shittin' rocks.

558
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:28,808
Him's nervous because he don't know
if he's gettin' nothin'.

559
00:55:31,789 --> 00:55:35,020
I don't think he should be nervous,
and you shouldn't be, either.

560
00:55:35,093 --> 00:55:37,926
'Cause if you're good, Santa knows it.

561
00:55:38,763 --> 00:55:41,129
If you believe in him and in your mom...

562
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:42,894
...and you believe in...

563
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:44,533
...your dad...

564
00:55:45,704 --> 00:55:50,266
...and you've been good all year round,
Santa Claus will bring you something.

565
00:55:50,876 --> 00:55:54,039
Sometimes I think
all that Santa crap is just bull.

566
00:55:54,547 --> 00:55:57,880
If he was so real, how come
we didn't get squat last year?

567
00:55:58,117 --> 00:56:01,554
We didn't do nothin' wrong
and we still got the shaft.

568
00:56:01,721 --> 00:56:05,714
Well, I happen to know for a fact
that Santa Claus is real.

569
00:56:06,459 --> 00:56:08,552
And in the next couple of days...

570
00:56:09,062 --> 00:56:11,394
...somehow, I'm gonna prove it to you.

571
00:56:12,732 --> 00:56:15,793
Every year, he comes to our house.
I've seen him.

572
00:56:17,071 --> 00:56:18,129
It's true?

573
00:56:18,406 --> 00:56:19,737
Cross my heart.

574
00:56:23,477 --> 00:56:25,672
It's a good idea you came to stay with us.

575
00:56:25,746 --> 00:56:29,910
I love it here. You don't gotta put on
your coat to go to the bathroom.

576
00:56:30,084 --> 00:56:32,918
And your house is always parked
in the same place.

577
00:56:36,425 --> 00:56:38,757
I think you better go back to bed, now.

578
00:56:42,598 --> 00:56:44,725
Okay. How come you ain't sleeping?

579
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,597
I was looking for something.

580
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:56,336
You didn't notice if a man came here
and delivered a letter today, did you?

581
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:58,844
Nope. How come?

582
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:00,776
Just wondering.

583
00:57:06,457 --> 00:57:08,618
Now you get back to bed. Come here.

584
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,231
Are you sure you ain't Santy Claus?

585
00:57:19,471 --> 00:57:20,495
I'm sure.

586
00:57:25,844 --> 00:57:27,812
I can't even afford to be an elf.

587
00:57:38,991 --> 00:57:43,155
I had two containers of K-rations...
two containers...

588
00:57:43,496 --> 00:57:46,932
...and I had Spam until
it was coming out of my ears!

589
00:57:58,178 --> 00:58:00,043
Aren't you having any breakfast?

590
00:58:00,113 --> 00:58:01,774
No. Not in the mood.

591
00:58:03,351 --> 00:58:05,046
What are you looking at?

592
00:58:07,522 --> 00:58:10,685
The silent majesty of a winter's morn.
The clean...

593
00:58:10,858 --> 00:58:12,951
...cool chill of the holiday air.

594
00:58:13,127 --> 00:58:16,790
An asshole, in a bathrobe,
emptying a chemical toilet into my sewer.

595
00:58:22,104 --> 00:58:23,628
The shitter was full.

596
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,474
Have you checked our shitters, honey?

597
00:58:26,542 --> 00:58:29,033
Clark, please.
He doesn't know any better.

598
00:58:29,378 --> 00:58:31,573
He ought to know it's illegal.
It's a storm sewer.

599
00:58:31,647 --> 00:58:36,051
If it fills with gas, I pity the person
who lights a match within ten yards of it.

600
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,237
Merry Christmas.

601
00:59:00,678 --> 00:59:02,202
The shitter was full.

602
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:21,465
I have this suspicion that Catherine and
Eddie don't have presents for their kids.

603
00:59:21,534 --> 00:59:26,198
Rocky said Eddie told him
Santa Claus wasn't coming this year.

604
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:33,211
Ruby Sue said the same thing last night.
How can they have nothing for their kids?

605
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:35,372
He's been out of work
for almost seven years.

606
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:37,713
In seven years he couldn't find a job?

607
00:59:37,785 --> 00:59:41,619
Catherine says he's been holding out
for a management position.

608
00:59:45,626 --> 00:59:47,389
So, how's the live bait business?

609
00:59:47,461 --> 00:59:50,294
I can't complain. How you doing?

610
00:59:50,964 --> 00:59:52,626
Not that good, actually.

611
00:59:52,901 --> 00:59:56,564
Your company kill off all them people
in India not long ago?

612
00:59:56,805 --> 00:59:59,069
No, we missed out on that one.

613
00:59:59,574 --> 01:00:02,065
You're pretty set so far as shopping goes?

614
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:04,809
Well, I can't lie to you, Clark.

615
01:00:05,146 --> 01:00:07,741
The truth is, things ain't goin'
too good at all.

616
01:00:07,817 --> 01:00:11,253
You know I told you I borrowed
the RV from a neighbor?

617
01:00:11,887 --> 01:00:12,876
It's mine.

618
01:00:13,455 --> 01:00:14,649
We live in it.

619
01:00:14,924 --> 01:00:18,485
I had to sell off the house,
the barn, the ten acres...

620
01:00:19,495 --> 01:00:23,990
All I kept was a 50-foot plot,
the pigs and the worm farm.

621
01:00:26,336 --> 01:00:29,999
If I only had back the money
me and Catherine sent that TV preacher...

622
01:00:30,073 --> 01:00:32,473
...that was screwin' the hockey players.

623
01:00:33,677 --> 01:00:35,008
What about the kids?

624
01:00:35,478 --> 01:00:37,503
His kids can fend for themselves.

625
01:00:37,781 --> 01:00:39,113
Your kids.

626
01:00:40,418 --> 01:00:43,148
That's the bitch of it.
I don't know what to do.

627
01:00:43,187 --> 01:00:47,681
We coasted into town on fumes.
The gas money give out in Guerney.

628
01:00:51,929 --> 01:00:55,127
Ellen and I want to help you
give the kids a nice Christmas.

629
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,361
No, Clark, I couldn't do that.

630
01:00:57,903 --> 01:00:58,961
We insist.

631
01:00:59,204 --> 01:01:01,638
No, I'm not one for charity.

632
01:01:01,874 --> 01:01:05,310
I know that, Eddie.
This isn't charity. It's family.

633
01:01:07,546 --> 01:01:09,481
I don't know about that.

634
01:01:09,716 --> 01:01:13,709
Now, come on, if you don't tell me
what they want, I'll get it on my own.

635
01:01:18,892 --> 01:01:20,723
This is a surprise, Clark.

636
01:01:21,394 --> 01:01:23,555
This is a real nice surprise.

637
01:01:24,497 --> 01:01:27,058
Just a real nice surprise.

638
01:01:32,306 --> 01:01:33,330
Here's a list.

639
01:01:33,407 --> 01:01:35,898
Alphabetical, starting with Catherine.

640
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:40,244
If it wouldn't be too much,
I'd like to get something for you, Clark.

641
01:01:40,382 --> 01:01:42,873
Something really nice.

642
01:02:00,569 --> 01:02:02,366
Is your house on fire, Clark?

643
01:02:02,605 --> 01:02:04,630
No Bethany, those are Christmas lights.

644
01:02:04,707 --> 01:02:06,504
Don't throw me down, Clark.

645
01:02:06,609 --> 01:02:07,940
I'll try not to.

646
01:02:08,611 --> 01:02:10,442
Is this the airport?

647
01:02:10,713 --> 01:02:11,942
We're here!

648
01:02:12,049 --> 01:02:15,610
Me and Bethany figured out
the perfect gift for you.

649
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:18,552
Uncle Louis, you didn't have to
buy me anything.

650
01:02:18,622 --> 01:02:20,954
Damn it, Bethany, he guessed it.

651
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:23,217
That was fun.

652
01:02:23,627 --> 01:02:25,959
I love riding in cars.

653
01:02:26,965 --> 01:02:29,297
When did you move to Florida?

654
01:02:32,403 --> 01:02:34,769
Are you still dating Clark?

655
01:02:38,409 --> 01:02:40,570
You know you shouldn't have done that.

656
01:02:40,645 --> 01:02:43,137
Oh, dear. Did I break wind?

657
01:02:43,816 --> 01:02:47,843
Jesus, did the room clear out, Bethany?
Hell, no.

658
01:02:47,987 --> 01:02:51,081
She means presents.
You shouldn't have bought presents.

659
01:02:51,156 --> 01:02:55,092
It isn't every day somebody moves
into a new house.

660
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,421
They didn't move into a new house.

661
01:02:59,733 --> 01:03:00,961
In the living room.

662
01:03:03,003 --> 01:03:05,335
This house is bigger than your old one.

663
01:03:07,073 --> 01:03:09,234
Is Rusty still in the Navy?

664
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:14,845
Why don't you go into the living room
and say hello to everybody?

665
01:03:15,182 --> 01:03:18,276
Hello, everybody! I should say it?

666
01:03:22,556 --> 01:03:23,955
- Mom?
- What?

667
01:03:24,358 --> 01:03:26,189
This box is meowing.

668
01:03:33,001 --> 01:03:34,628
She wrapped up her damn cat.

669
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:37,805
- Take it in the kitchen. Open it up.
- And have a cat running around?

670
01:03:37,873 --> 01:03:39,306
We can't leave it in the box.

671
01:03:39,374 --> 01:03:41,865
Why would somebody wrap up
a cat in a box?

672
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:44,178
She gets confused. She's old.

673
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:47,374
They don't have much money,
so she takes things from the house...

674
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:49,611
...wraps them up,
gives them away as presents.

675
01:03:49,685 --> 01:03:51,243
Can't wait to see what I got!

676
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,981
This one here...

677
01:03:53,222 --> 01:03:54,484
...is leaking.

678
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:01,359
Lime.

679
01:04:01,832 --> 01:04:03,299
It's her Jell-O mold.

680
01:04:03,367 --> 01:04:07,565
I'll take it, Eddie. Go into
the living room and enjoy yourself.

681
01:04:10,841 --> 01:04:12,570
Let's go find your sister.

682
01:04:33,799 --> 01:04:34,959
Before we begin...

683
01:04:35,634 --> 01:04:38,262
...since this is Aunt Bethany's
80th Christmas...

684
01:04:38,771 --> 01:04:41,740
...I think she should lead us
in the saying of grace.

685
01:04:45,878 --> 01:04:47,005
What, dear?

686
01:04:49,082 --> 01:04:49,912
Grace!

687
01:04:51,451 --> 01:04:54,852
Grace? She passed away 30 years ago.

688
01:04:55,889 --> 01:04:58,119
They want you to say grace.

689
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:03,123
The blessing.

690
01:05:20,015 --> 01:05:21,414
"I pledge allegiance...

691
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:25,313
"...to the flag of
the United States of America...

692
01:05:25,754 --> 01:05:27,415
"...and to the republic...

693
01:05:27,656 --> 01:05:31,922
"...for which it stands,
one nation under God, indivisible...

694
01:05:32,494 --> 01:05:35,828
"...with liberty and justice for all."

695
01:05:38,001 --> 01:05:38,729
Amen.

696
01:05:45,008 --> 01:05:48,945
Catherine, if this turkey tastes
half as good as it looks...

697
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:51,774
...I think we're all
in for a very big treat.

698
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:57,784
Save the neck for me, Clark.

699
01:06:14,306 --> 01:06:15,466
I'm sorry.

700
01:06:16,508 --> 01:06:17,566
Why are you crying?

701
01:06:17,642 --> 01:06:20,134
I told you we put it in too early.

702
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:23,044
It's just a little dry. It's fine.

703
01:06:25,785 --> 01:06:26,843
Here's the heart.

704
01:07:27,851 --> 01:07:29,148
Aunt Bethany...

705
01:07:30,787 --> 01:07:32,914
Does your cat happen to eat Jell-O?

706
01:07:35,225 --> 01:07:37,126
I don't know about the cat...

707
01:07:37,528 --> 01:07:38,893
...but I'm enjoying it.

708
01:07:52,243 --> 01:07:53,074
Kids...

709
01:07:53,979 --> 01:07:55,071
...I heard on the news...

710
01:07:55,147 --> 01:07:59,777
...that an airline pilot spotted Santa's sled
on its way in from New York.

711
01:08:05,657 --> 01:08:06,885
You serious, Clark?

712
01:08:09,929 --> 01:08:13,421
Load me up with a little more there.
It's good.

713
01:08:24,278 --> 01:08:26,007
What's wrong with the dog?

714
01:08:29,683 --> 01:08:34,450
He's just yackin' on a bone.
He's got it up. He's all right now.

715
01:08:36,256 --> 01:08:38,817
Maybe if you wouldn't feed him
from the table...

716
01:08:40,362 --> 01:08:42,023
No.

717
01:08:42,864 --> 01:08:45,856
He's probably just nosing
through the trash.

718
01:08:56,011 --> 01:08:58,377
If you're not doing anything constructive...

719
01:08:58,447 --> 01:09:01,075
...run into the living room, get my stogie.

720
01:09:02,551 --> 01:09:05,486
Is there anything else
I can do for you, Uncle Louis?

721
01:09:05,921 --> 01:09:08,287
He's an old man.
This may be his last Christmas.

722
01:09:09,492 --> 01:09:12,223
He keeps it up,
it will be his last Christmas.

723
01:09:45,964 --> 01:09:47,261
That should be it.

724
01:10:03,683 --> 01:10:06,243
I told you, you had
too many plugs in one outlet.

725
01:10:08,822 --> 01:10:09,754
What is it?

726
01:10:12,026 --> 01:10:14,961
Nothing. Let's go in
and finish our dessert.

727
01:10:17,731 --> 01:10:20,791
If that thing had nine lives,
she just spent them all.

728
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:29,800
If you don't mind,
I'd like to try to fumigate this here chair.

729
01:10:30,512 --> 01:10:32,309
It's a good quality item.

730
01:10:34,416 --> 01:10:38,477
If you don't mind me askin',
how much it set you back?

731
01:10:39,521 --> 01:10:41,113
Do you smell something?

732
01:10:43,392 --> 01:10:44,825
Fried pussycat.

733
01:10:47,563 --> 01:10:51,192
It's not the chair, it's some kind
of gas coming from the sewer.

734
01:11:41,186 --> 01:11:42,483
My tree!

735
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:46,716
So, what's the matter with you?

736
01:11:47,727 --> 01:11:49,820
Look what you've done to my tree!

737
01:12:05,212 --> 01:12:07,180
It was an ugly tree anyway.

738
01:12:08,015 --> 01:12:10,074
At least it's out of its misery.

739
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,776
- Dad's gonna flip out.
- Nobody's gonna flip out.

740
01:12:12,853 --> 01:12:15,321
We're gonna have a wonderful Christmas.

741
01:12:18,894 --> 01:12:20,293
What the hell do you want?

742
01:12:20,362 --> 01:12:23,160
I have a delivery for Clark W. Griswold.

743
01:12:23,332 --> 01:12:25,562
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday...

744
01:12:25,701 --> 01:12:30,035
...but it fell between the seats
and I didn't see it. I'm sorry.

745
01:12:37,213 --> 01:12:38,544
Merry Christmas.

746
01:12:39,782 --> 01:12:41,113
Merry Christmas.

747
01:12:45,054 --> 01:12:46,818
- I can't believe it.
- What is it?

748
01:12:47,491 --> 01:12:50,324
A letter confirming your reservation
at the nuthouse?

749
01:12:50,961 --> 01:12:52,155
It's from my company.

750
01:12:52,963 --> 01:12:53,759
Your bonus.

751
01:12:54,498 --> 01:12:55,396
My bonus.

752
01:13:01,171 --> 01:13:02,969
Open it, Clarkie. Open it.

753
01:13:03,642 --> 01:13:05,803
I hope it's a fortune.

754
01:13:06,478 --> 01:13:07,740
I bet you do.

755
01:13:12,617 --> 01:13:13,641
I was afraid...

756
01:13:13,918 --> 01:13:17,752
Are you going to bawl all over it,
or are you gonna open it?

757
01:13:19,992 --> 01:13:23,860
I was gonna wait till tomorrow
to tell you all this, but what the heck?

758
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:28,097
With this bonus check,
I'm putting in a swimming pool.

759
01:13:32,438 --> 01:13:34,669
That's it. That's the big one!

760
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:38,168
Open it!

761
01:13:40,914 --> 01:13:44,350
I'm sorry if I've been
a little short with everyone lately.

762
01:13:44,918 --> 01:13:46,715
I've been waiting for this bonus.

763
01:13:46,987 --> 01:13:49,115
To make sure the pool goes in
when the ground thaws...

764
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:51,181
...I had to lay out the money in advance.

765
01:13:51,259 --> 01:13:55,423
Until this arrived, I didn't have enough
to cover the check.

766
01:13:55,763 --> 01:13:57,958
Tear the sucker open, Dad.

767
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:00,531
Drum roll.

768
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:13,541
If there's enough left,
I'll fly you all down to help us dedicate it.

769
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:19,211
I can't swim, Clark.

770
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:21,887
I know that, Eddie.

771
01:14:36,874 --> 01:14:38,068
What's wrong?

772
01:14:41,412 --> 01:14:43,744
It's bigger than you expected?

773
01:14:47,451 --> 01:14:48,418
Smaller?

774
01:14:51,256 --> 01:14:52,416
What is it?

775
01:14:54,226 --> 01:14:58,026
A one-year membership
in the Jelly-of-the-Month Club.

776
01:14:59,197 --> 01:15:03,190
That's the gift that keeps on giving
the whole year.

777
01:15:04,936 --> 01:15:06,404
That it is, Edward.

778
01:15:07,373 --> 01:15:08,533
That it is, indeed.

779
01:15:09,442 --> 01:15:10,602
I'm sorry.

780
01:15:12,779 --> 01:15:17,614
If this isn't the biggest bag-over-the-head
punch in the face I ever got! Goddamn it!

781
01:15:18,651 --> 01:15:19,447
Son.

782
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,561
It's good.

783
01:15:43,511 --> 01:15:47,106
If any of you are looking
for any last-minute gift ideas for me...

784
01:15:47,182 --> 01:15:48,479
...I have one.

785
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,980
I'd like Frank Shirley,
my boss, right here, tonight.

786
01:15:52,988 --> 01:15:57,322
Brought from his happy holiday slumber
on Melody Lane with all the rich people.

787
01:15:57,493 --> 01:15:59,484
I want him brought right here...

788
01:15:59,829 --> 01:16:04,163
...with a big ribbon on his head and
I want to look him straight in the eye...

789
01:16:04,433 --> 01:16:07,925
...and I want to tell him
what a cheap, lying, no good, rotten...

790
01:16:08,003 --> 01:16:11,201
...low-life, snake-licking, dirt-eating,
inbred, overstuffed...

791
01:16:11,341 --> 01:16:15,869
...ignorant, bloodsucking,
brainless, dickless, hopeless...

792
01:16:16,346 --> 01:16:20,009
...heartless, fat-assed, bug-eyed,
stiff-legged, spotty-lipped...

793
01:16:20,183 --> 01:16:23,175
...worm-headed sack of monkey shit he is!

794
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,852
Hallelujah!

795
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:27,689
Holy shit! Where's the Tylenol?

796
01:16:41,306 --> 01:16:43,240
He has that crazy look in his eye.

797
01:16:43,308 --> 01:16:45,640
I told you we should have gone to Hawaii.

798
01:16:45,978 --> 01:16:48,538
Turn that thing off and get in the house!

799
01:16:49,314 --> 01:16:50,975
I'll talk to him, Mom.

800
01:16:54,553 --> 01:16:55,919
You know, Dad...

801
01:16:56,055 --> 01:16:57,647
...l've been thinking.

802
01:16:59,225 --> 01:17:00,658
Good talk.

803
01:17:06,499 --> 01:17:09,468
Aren't you a teeny bit sorry
we didn't get a Christmas tree?

804
01:17:09,569 --> 01:17:12,733
Even though they're dirty and messy
and corny and clichd?

805
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:16,403
Where are you going to find a tree
at this hour on Christmas Eve?

806
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:36,628
What's the matter?

807
01:17:38,934 --> 01:17:40,196
Was that really necessary?

808
01:17:42,705 --> 01:17:43,967
We needed a tree.

809
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,701
May I remind you that...

810
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:49,038
That this was all my idea?
No, no. I'm well aware of that.

811
01:17:49,779 --> 01:17:53,112
Could you just keep it in mind
the next time you go berserk?

812
01:17:53,449 --> 01:17:56,612
I didn't go berserk.
I simply solved a problem.

813
01:17:58,889 --> 01:18:00,447
We needed a coffin.

814
01:18:01,792 --> 01:18:05,387
A tree. There are no lots open
on Christmas Eve.

815
01:18:05,796 --> 01:18:09,732
Louis burned down my tree
so I replaced it as best I could. Voil...

816
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,528
Are you okay?

817
01:18:11,635 --> 01:18:13,228
I'm fine, honey.

818
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:39,491
I fixed the newel post.

819
01:19:02,556 --> 01:19:03,955
What's that sound?

820
01:19:25,881 --> 01:19:27,212
Do you hear it?

821
01:19:28,216 --> 01:19:30,651
It's a funny, squeaking sound.

822
01:19:31,387 --> 01:19:35,881
You couldn't hear a dump truck
driving through a nitroglycerin plant.

823
01:19:37,393 --> 01:19:38,690
I hear it, too.

824
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:48,728
I don't hear it anymore.

825
01:19:54,078 --> 01:19:55,409
Squirrel!

826
01:20:03,188 --> 01:20:05,088
What was it? Oh, my God!

827
01:20:11,429 --> 01:20:12,760
Quiet! Shut up!

828
01:20:26,445 --> 01:20:27,776
Mom, don't move.

829
01:20:30,282 --> 01:20:32,410
We can't let it out of the living room.

830
01:20:33,587 --> 01:20:36,454
Where's Eddie?
He usually eats these goddamn things.

831
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:40,385
Not recently, Clark. He read that squirrels
were high in cholesterol.

832
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:42,890
Thank you, Catherine.

833
01:20:44,397 --> 01:20:45,625
I'll try and trap it.

834
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:46,857
Russ!

835
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:48,125
We're here, Dad.

836
01:20:48,769 --> 01:20:49,793
There you are.

837
01:20:50,972 --> 01:20:52,371
Go get the hammer.

838
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,574
What do you need a hammer for?

839
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:58,575
I'll catch it in the coat
and smack it with the hammer.

840
01:21:05,988 --> 01:21:07,580
I'm going in with him.

841
01:21:11,326 --> 01:21:12,486
Nora?

842
01:21:16,098 --> 01:21:17,087
Is it gone?

843
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:19,658
It probably got scared
and ran back into the tree.

844
01:21:20,436 --> 01:21:22,165
Squirrel!

845
01:22:00,912 --> 01:22:05,043
You just march right over there
and slug that creep in the face.

846
01:22:05,218 --> 01:22:06,742
I can't just attack someone.

847
01:22:06,819 --> 01:22:11,051
All right, then. If you're not man enough
to put an end to this shit, then I am.

848
01:22:32,846 --> 01:22:33,540
Gone.

849
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:40,679
Oh, my God.

850
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:45,348
What happened to you?

851
01:22:58,274 --> 01:23:00,936
Where do you think you're going?
Nobody's leaving.

852
01:23:01,277 --> 01:23:04,144
Nobody walks out
on this old-fashioned family Christmas.

853
01:23:04,213 --> 01:23:06,613
No, we're all in this together.

854
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:09,942
This is a full-blown,
four-alarm holiday emergency.

855
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:13,553
We're going to press on
and have the happiest Christmas...

856
01:23:13,723 --> 01:23:16,556
...since Bing Crosby tap-danced
with Danny fucking Kaye.

857
01:23:16,626 --> 01:23:19,652
And when Santa squeezes
his fat, white ass down the chimney...

858
01:23:19,729 --> 01:23:23,723
...he's gonna find the jolliest bunch
of assholes this side of the nuthouse.

859
01:23:23,934 --> 01:23:25,162
You're goofy.

860
01:23:25,469 --> 01:23:27,130
Don't piss me off, Art.

861
01:23:28,306 --> 01:23:31,400
- It's over.
- Not according to Santa's watch, it isn't.

862
01:23:31,475 --> 01:23:32,737
Stay out of this, Dad.

863
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:35,904
Clark, I think it's best
if everyone just goes home.

864
01:23:36,247 --> 01:23:37,840
Before things get worse.

865
01:23:37,916 --> 01:23:40,908
Worse?! How could they get any worse?

866
01:23:41,153 --> 01:23:45,146
Look around you, Ellen.
We're at the threshold of hell!

867
01:24:03,176 --> 01:24:04,165
Son.

868
01:24:06,012 --> 01:24:08,344
I love you. We all love you.

869
01:24:08,681 --> 01:24:12,174
But this is a terrible night.
Nothing's gone right. It's a disaster.

870
01:24:12,953 --> 01:24:15,786
But losing your temper
only makes things worse.

871
01:24:16,023 --> 01:24:18,685
You're too good a father to act like this.

872
01:24:20,694 --> 01:24:25,359
In years to come, you'll want your family
to remember all the love you gave us...

873
01:24:25,633 --> 01:24:28,693
...and how hard you tried
to make the perfect Christmas.

874
01:24:29,304 --> 01:24:30,896
You just cocked it up.

875
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:36,207
It's okay. It happens.

876
01:24:38,313 --> 01:24:40,646
All our holidays were always such a mess.

877
01:24:42,718 --> 01:24:44,515
How did you get through it?

878
01:24:45,388 --> 01:24:47,379
I had a lot of help from Jack Daniels.

879
01:24:57,067 --> 01:24:58,398
I love you.

880
01:25:03,006 --> 01:25:05,167
Will you recite
"The Night Before Christmas"?

881
01:25:05,242 --> 01:25:07,574
No. It's your house.

882
01:25:07,844 --> 01:25:09,402
It's your Christmas.

883
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:12,173
I'm retiring.

884
01:25:13,551 --> 01:25:16,418
"The children were nestled
All snug in their beds

885
01:25:16,754 --> 01:25:19,746
"While visions of sugarplums
Danced in their heads

886
01:25:20,358 --> 01:25:21,848
"And Mama in her kerchief

887
01:25:21,926 --> 01:25:25,919
"And I in my cap, just settled our brains
For a long winter's nap

888
01:25:26,197 --> 01:25:29,690
"When out on the lawn
There arose such a clatter

889
01:25:29,802 --> 01:25:32,032
"I sprang from my bed
To see what was the matter

890
01:25:32,104 --> 01:25:34,231
"Away to the window I flew like a flash

891
01:25:34,406 --> 01:25:36,738
"Tore open the shutters
and threw up the sash

892
01:25:36,942 --> 01:25:38,933
"The moon on the breast of
the new-fallen snow

893
01:25:39,011 --> 01:25:41,536
"Gave a luster of midday to objects below

894
01:25:41,713 --> 01:25:44,046
"When what to my wondering eyes
should appear

895
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:45,845
"But a miniature sleigh..."

896
01:25:47,587 --> 01:25:48,451
...and Eddie.

897
01:25:48,788 --> 01:25:51,450
And a man in his pajamas
with a dog chain...

898
01:25:51,624 --> 01:25:54,058
...tied to his wrists and ankles.
What the...?

899
01:25:56,463 --> 01:25:57,624
Stay here.

900
01:26:03,971 --> 01:26:06,030
Merry Christmas, Clark.

901
01:26:07,308 --> 01:26:10,141
You about ready to do some kissin'?

902
01:26:11,812 --> 01:26:14,577
Officer, it seems
my husband has been abducted.

903
01:26:14,816 --> 01:26:18,479
The man was wearing a blue leisure suit...

904
01:26:19,988 --> 01:26:24,925
...and the plates were from Kansas.
He was a huge, beastly, bulging man.

905
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,592
I have never been treated
like this in my life.

906
01:26:27,829 --> 01:26:30,162
I'm sorry.
This is our family's first kidnapping.

907
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,428
You're fired.

908
01:26:32,835 --> 01:26:34,666
Where's the phone? I'm calling the police.

909
01:26:34,737 --> 01:26:36,728
Just hold your wad there, fella.

910
01:26:37,006 --> 01:26:40,840
Clark had nothin' to do with this.
This here was my idea.

911
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:44,672
All right. He's still fired
and you are going to jail.

912
01:26:46,517 --> 01:26:48,109
It was my fault.

913
01:26:49,186 --> 01:26:53,350
I lost my temper when I got my bonus
and I said a few things I shouldn't have.

914
01:26:53,524 --> 01:26:58,188
Bonus? How did you get a bonus?
I cut out bonuses this year.

915
01:26:59,364 --> 01:27:00,888
Thanks for telling us.

916
01:27:00,965 --> 01:27:04,298
I was expecting a check.
Instead I got enrolled in a jelly club.

917
01:27:04,869 --> 01:27:08,862
In 17 years with the company, I've gotten
a bonus every year, but this one.

918
01:27:09,207 --> 01:27:11,141
You don't want to give bonuses, fine!

919
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:13,675
When people count on them
as part of their salary...

920
01:27:13,912 --> 01:27:15,642
What you did just plain...

921
01:27:15,781 --> 01:27:16,839
Sucks.

922
01:27:18,717 --> 01:27:20,048
Thank you, Russ.

923
01:27:23,722 --> 01:27:26,555
My cousin-in-law,
whose heart is bigger than his brain...

924
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:28,383
I appreciate that.

925
01:27:29,728 --> 01:27:32,823
...is innocent. I'll be more than happy
to take the rap on this...

926
01:27:33,233 --> 01:27:37,226
...on behalf of myself and every other
employee you rear-ended this Christmas.

927
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:02,262
Sometimes things look good
on paper, but...

928
01:28:02,531 --> 01:28:06,433
...lose their luster when you see
how it affects real folks.

929
01:28:07,436 --> 01:28:09,927
A healthy bottom line
doesn't mean much if...

930
01:28:10,005 --> 01:28:13,099
...to get it, you have to hurt
the ones you depend on.

931
01:28:15,277 --> 01:28:19,772
It's people that make the difference.
Little people, like you.

932
01:28:22,385 --> 01:28:24,376
So, Carl...

933
01:28:26,122 --> 01:28:28,147
...whatever you got last year...

934
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:31,123
...add 20 percent.

935
01:29:24,184 --> 01:29:26,175
Go away, Todd.

936
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:31,848
If you want to come in, you are gonna
have to break down the goddamn door!

937
01:29:43,037 --> 01:29:46,200
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night!

938
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:58,880
Freeze!

939
01:30:01,056 --> 01:30:02,887
Not you! Them!

940
01:30:12,736 --> 01:30:14,067
This way, please.

941
01:30:17,073 --> 01:30:19,007
I think you've made a terrible mistake.

942
01:30:19,342 --> 01:30:20,833
I told you to freeze, mister.

943
01:30:21,078 --> 01:30:22,306
May we blink?

944
01:30:29,086 --> 01:30:32,078
- Thank God you're all right.
- I'm fine. I'm just fine.

945
01:30:32,423 --> 01:30:34,414
There was a big
misunderstanding tonight.

946
01:30:34,959 --> 01:30:39,397
Excuse me. Would you and Mrs. Shirley
like to step outside so we can finish here?

947
01:30:40,432 --> 01:30:43,026
- Don't bother. I'm not pressing charges.
- What?

948
01:30:44,102 --> 01:30:45,399
It was a mistake.

949
01:30:45,470 --> 01:30:48,200
Mistake? Honey, you were kidnapped.

950
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,599
I did something I shouldn't have...

951
01:30:50,776 --> 01:30:55,373
...and these people called me on it.
This is Clark Griswold and his family.

952
01:30:55,782 --> 01:30:57,272
Welcome to our home.

953
01:30:58,618 --> 01:31:00,017
What's left of it.

954
01:31:00,119 --> 01:31:01,484
Release B Squad.

955
01:31:01,788 --> 01:31:03,221
What's going on here?

956
01:31:03,456 --> 01:31:07,791
Remember how I was toying with the
notion of suspending Christmas bonuses?

957
01:31:08,462 --> 01:31:09,793
You didn't.

958
01:31:10,063 --> 01:31:13,396
Of all the cheap,
lousy ways to save a buck!

959
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:15,067
That's pretty low, mister.

960
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:17,228
If I had a rubber hose...

961
01:31:17,304 --> 01:31:19,636
I changed my mind.
I'm reinstating all the bonuses.

962
01:31:25,246 --> 01:31:26,907
Look!

963
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:30,477
Look!

964
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,820
It's Santy Claus.

965
01:31:42,665 --> 01:31:44,826
Uncle Clark, it's Santy Claus.

966
01:31:46,335 --> 01:31:48,030
It's the Christmas star.

967
01:31:48,504 --> 01:31:50,335
And that's all that matters tonight.

968
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:55,842
Not bonuses or gifts or turkeys or trees.

969
01:31:56,446 --> 01:31:57,777
See, kids...

970
01:31:58,782 --> 01:32:01,182
It means something different
to everybody.

971
01:32:03,453 --> 01:32:05,250
Now I know what it means to me.

972
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:09,523
That ain't the frigging Christmas star.

973
01:32:09,694 --> 01:32:12,857
It's the light
on the sewage treatment plant.

974
01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:14,461
Sewer gas.

975
01:32:16,467 --> 01:32:17,832
Don't drop that!

976
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,371
"And the rocket's red glare

977
01:32:31,383 --> 01:32:34,546
"The bombs bursting in air

978
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,550
"Gave proof through the night

979
01:32:38,657 --> 01:32:42,150
"That our flag was still there

980
01:32:43,229 --> 01:32:45,390
"Oh, say does that

981
01:32:45,465 --> 01:32:50,061
"Star-spangled banner yet wave

982
01:32:52,405 --> 01:32:55,397
"O'er the land of the free

983
01:32:58,078 --> 01:33:02,071
"And the home of the brave?"

984
01:33:06,587 --> 01:33:08,179
Play ball!

985
01:33:16,264 --> 01:33:18,255
Merry Christmas, Sparky.

986
01:33:19,267 --> 01:33:20,894
Merry Christmas, honey.

987
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,126
I did it.
