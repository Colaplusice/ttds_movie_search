1
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:28,580
Totoro

2
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,260
Go! Go! Go!

3
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,700
Energetic!

4
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,220
I like walking most.

5
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,380
Walk straight

6
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,300
Up the hills

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,220
Big tunnels

8
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,620
Grasslands

9
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,460
Long bridges

10
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,020
The lively road

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,620
Look at the spider nets

12
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,500
Down the hills

13
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,380
Go! Go! Go!

14
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,220
Energetic!

15
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,260
I like walking most

16
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,500
Walk straight

17
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,260
wolves

18
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,460
foxes

19
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,860
come here

20
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,340
deep to the forest

21
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,460
enjoy the adventure

22
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,020
Many many friends

23
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,540
Make me live happily

24
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,900
Many many friends

25
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:04,500
Make me live happily

26
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,380
Father, caramel.

27
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,940
Oh, thanks.

28
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,700
Are you tired?

29
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,620
It's just a little further.

30
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,380
Mei! Hide!

31
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,180
It wasn't a policeman.

32
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,340
Is someone there from this house?

33
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,460
Oh, thanks.

34
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,540
I'm Kusakabe.

35
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,380
We've arrived. Welcome!

36
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,500
Sorry for bothering

37
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,700
Thanks for your help

38
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,940
Thanks a lot.

39
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,660
Well, we've arrived.

40
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,980
Wait!

41
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,260
Mei, there's a bridge.

42
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,140
Fish.

43
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,820
See, it flashed again

44
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,580
Well, do you like it?

45
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,260
Father, it's beautiful!

46
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,780
A tunnel of trees.

47
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,020
Ah, that house?

48
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,100
Hurry

49
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,500
Yes!

50
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,340
It's like a haunted house!

51
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,380
It's rotten.

52
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,620
Mei, look!

53
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,580
There... Isn't it big?

54
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,660
Father, a huge tree!

55
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,700
Right, it's a camphor tree.

56
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,820
Oh, a camphor tree.

57
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,900
A nut.

58
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,900
Let me see.

59
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,340
Another one.

60
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,660
Woo...

61
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,460
Here it is

62
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,060
Hey, hey.

63
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,980
We've got to open up
the storm shutters.

64
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,700
Nuts!

65
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,660
They fell from above.

66
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,100
Squirrels?

67
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,940
Or maybe acorn-

68
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,940
mice?

69
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,260
No, squirrels are better.

70
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,540
Where do you want this?

71
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,100
Ah, just a minute.
I'll open up over here.

72
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:02,860
Satsuki,

73
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,300
would you open the back door?

74
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,620
You should be able to find it.

75
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,740
Come on!

76
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,620
Wait!

77
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,580
Hurry up!

78
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,460
I'm going in.

79
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,660
The bath...

80
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,420
Nobody's here

81
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,820
It's a bath

82
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,700
Father,
there's something in here.

83
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,540
Squirrels? I don't know.

84
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,500
Not cockroaches, not mice...

85
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,060
Black. There were a wholebunch!

86
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,740
Hmmmmm. Hmmmmm...

87
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,890
It must be Mak-kuro Kurosuke

88
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,770
Mak-kuro Kurosuke?

89
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,540
Like the ones in the picture book?

90
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,860
It must be... Ghosts

91
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,420
wouldn't be out on a beautiful day like this.

92
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,540
When you suddenly enter a dark place
from bright sunlight,

93
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,060
black spots appear in front of your eyes.

94
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,460
So that's it!

95
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,820
MAK-KURO KUROSUKE, COME ON OUT!

96
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,620
IF YOU DON'T, WE'LL PULL
YOU OUT BY YOUR EYEBALLS!!!

97
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,660
Okay, back to work.

98
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,660
Where are the stairs to the second floor?

99
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,860
Let's find the stairs
and open the upstairs windows.

100
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,900
Okay!

101
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,220
Toilet!

102
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,540
Not Here!

103
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,260
Not Here!

104
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,260
Mei, I found it...

105
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,380
It's pitch black.

106
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,900
Mak-kuro Kurosuke!

107
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,060
...A nut!

108
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,620
MAK-KURO KUROSUKE, COME OUT!

109
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,100
Mister Mak-kuro Kurosuke,
are you here?

110
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,820
Father,

111
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,620
there's something
in this house after all!

112
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,580
That's great!

113
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,420
Since I was a boy,

114
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,140
I've wanted to live in a haunted house!

115
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,580
Ooops!

116
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,620
I got one!! Sis!!

117
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,020
What energy!

118
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,020
This is the neighbor-lady
who watches over this house.

119
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,220
She came to help us move in.

120
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,420
I'm Satsuki and this is my sister, Mei.
How do you do?

121
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,060
How do you do?

122
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,180
What nice children.

123
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,860
If there had been time

124
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,860
I could have cleaned up the house.

125
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,100
You've done plenty.

126
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,220
We're so busy
in the fields right now,

127
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,820
but I cleaned a little,
every so often.

128
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,540
Mei, your hands are black!
What happened?

129
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,900
Mak-kuro Kurosuke escaped!

130
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,380
Oh, Mei, your feet...

131
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,860
Oh, mine are black too!

132
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,100
Oh, Oh. It looks like the 'susu-atari'
have come out.

133
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,380
Susu-atari?

134
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,140
Are susu-atari like this,
and move like this?

135
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,900
Yes,

136
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,060
they live in old, empty houses

137
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,820
and make dust here and there.

138
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,300
I could see them too, when I was young.

139
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,580
So, you also saw them...

140
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,220
Are they ghosts?

141
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,500
Nothing that scary.

142
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,660
If you're good,
they won't do anything bad.

143
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,100
Then before you know it,
they're gone.

144
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,660
They're probably up
in the ceiling right now,

145
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,740
discussing whether to move out.

146
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,980
Mei, they're going to leave.

147
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,980
I don't like that.

148
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,300
But what would you do
if they came out at once?

149
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,540
Mei not scared.

150
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,940
Okay then.
I won't go with you to the toilet at night.

151
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,940
Say, would you go to the creek
and bring up some water?

152
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,580
The creek? Mei go too.

153
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,500
Mei,
you better stay and here and wait.

154
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,220
Have you caught the fish!

155
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,620
Granny!

156
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,980
Keep pumping,

157
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,180
until the water runs cold.

158
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,500
Oh, it's you.

159
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,220
What can I do for you?

160
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,220
From Mother, for Granny.

161
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,620
What is it?

162
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,100
Wait! What is this?

163
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,580
Is that Kanta?

164
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,540
YAH-H-H!! YOUR HOUSE IS HAUNTED!!!

165
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,100
KANTA!

166
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,860
Ha, ha, ha!
Reminds me of when I was a boy.

167
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,380
I hate boys!

168
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,740
But I love Granny's sweet rice cake.

169
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,420
Eat all you like.

170
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,850
Thank you for all your help.

171
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,330
Thank you very much.

172
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,900
Goodbye!

173
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,580
Father,

174
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,460
this old house will fall down.

175
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,900
Ha, ha! What a problem,
since we just moved in.

176
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,220
HA HA HA HA HA! Everyone laugh!

177
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,140
So your fears will all run away.

178
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,220
Mei not scared,

179
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,780
Mei not scared.

180
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,780
One, two,

181
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:08,220
one, two...

182
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,140
Okay, laundry is finished.

183
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,820
Off we go!

184
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,820
Granny!

185
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,220
How are you!

186
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,220
Don't work too hard!

187
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,580
Where are you going?

188
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,340
To the hospital to visit mother!

189
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,660
That's nice!

190
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,380
Say hello for me!

191
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,100
Okay!

192
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,100
This way, this way!

193
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,220
Good day. Welcome.

194
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,380
Oh, MOTHER!

195
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,700
Mei, it's good to see you!

196
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,780
Father took the wrong road.

197
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,660
Really? Welcome.

198
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,980
Today is the Harvest Holiday.

199
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,940
Father's talking with the doctor.

200
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,540
I'm so happy you all came.

201
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,140
How's the new house?

202
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,740
Are you settled in?

203
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,740
What? A haunted house?

204
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,540
Mother, do you like haunted houses?

205
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,900
Of course.

206
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,860
I've got to hurry and get well.
I'd like to meet a ghost.

207
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,660
That's good. Right, Mei?

208
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,380
We were worried.
If you were scared,

209
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,620
We wouldn't know what to do.

210
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,820
What about you two? We like it!!

211
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,060
Mei not scared!

212
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,460
Is Satsuki doing Mei's hair?

213
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,260
Your good at it.
Isn't that nice, Mei?

214
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,900
Unn, but Satsuki gets real mad.

215
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,340
That's because you never stay still.

216
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,500
Satsuki,

217
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,620
come here. Isn't it too short?

218
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,260
Satsuki, I like it this way.

219
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,580
Mei too, Mei too!

220
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,580
Unruly, just like always, isn't it.

221
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,340
Exactly like mine when I was your age.

222
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,500
When I grow up,
will my hair be just like Mother's?

223
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,660
Probably,

224
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,140
since you're just like I used to be.

225
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,500
Mother's looking good, isn't she?

226
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,860
Yes.

227
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,700
The doctor was saying
she'll be able to leave the hospital soon.

228
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,860
Soon? Tomorrow?

229
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,180
There she goes again with 'tomorrow'.

230
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,860
Tomorrow is probably too soon, though.

231
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,300
Mother says she wants to sleep together
with Mei again.

232
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,740
But you're a big girl now.

233
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,580
Weren't you going to sleep by yourself?

234
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,780
With mother is okay.

235
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,580
Father,

236
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,900
it's morning!

237
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,460
Hey, WAKE UP!!

238
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,660
Starting today,

239
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,500
I'm taking lunch (to school).

240
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,900
Darn, I completely forgot.

241
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,420
It's okay. I'll make everyone's.

242
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,420
It's burning!

243
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,620
This one is Mei's.

244
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,580
Mei's?

245
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,060
Want meal

246
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,300
Here. Wrap it yourself, okay?

247
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,180
Satsuki-chan!

248
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,100
Oh, no!

249
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,220
OKAY!!

250
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,380
You made a friend already?

251
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,900
She called you 'Satsuki-chan'.

252
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:05,220
I've had enough.

253
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,620
I'll be going.

254
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,900
Have a nice day.

255
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,740
Morning.

256
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,340
Hurry, let's go.

257
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,300
Morning.

258
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,980
Father,

259
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,540
does Mei look like Sis?

260
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,500
Yes. Where are you going
with your lunch basket?

261
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,460
Just over there.

262
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,420
Father, is it time for lunch?

263
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,460
What, already?

264
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,660
Father is a florist, okay?

265
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,500
Tadpoles!

266
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,060
Ah, bottom's gone.

267
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,780
Found one!

268
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,140
Who are you?

269
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,460
Mak-Kuro Kurosuke?

270
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,900
To To Ro.

271
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,820
Totoro... Your name is Totoro, right?

272
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,380
So... it's Totoro, after all... Totoro.

273
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,580
See you later.

274
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:22,980
I'm home.

275
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,460
Welcome. Oh, is it that time already?

276
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,130
Where's Mei?
I'm going over to Mit-chan's house.

277
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,610
We haven't had lunch yet.
Isn't she playing in the garden?

278
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,340
Mei!

279
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,210
MEI!!!

280
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,540
Mei!

281
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,060
Mei!

282
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,940
Father, I found Mei's hat.

283
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,940
Mei, Mei!!

284
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,580
...MEI! Wake up

285
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,220
You can't sleep in a place like this!

286
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,620
Where's Totoro? Totoro?

287
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,300
Huh? Huh?

288
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,580
Were you dreaming?

289
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,820
Totoro was here.

290
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,900
Totoro? You mean Tororo
that was in the picture book?

291
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,100
Unn. He said he was Totoro.

292
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,980
With fur,

293
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,780
and a mouth like this.

294
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,020
One like this,

295
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,660
and one about like this.

296
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,620
There you are, there you are.

297
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,020
Hey, how great.

298
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,460
Just like a secret hideaway.

299
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,980
Father! Mei, says she met Totoro here.

300
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,980
Totoro?

301
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,300
Over here!

302
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,900
Hey, wait!

303
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,380
Here?

304
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,460
Uh-uh.
Before he was by the big tree.

305
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,740
But there was only one pathway...

306
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,260
Mei,

307
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,260
let's go home. I said, Mei!

308
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,180
It's true!

309
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,260
There really was Totoro!

310
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,860
Not a lie.

311
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,140
Mei...

312
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,500
It not lie.

313
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,340
Uh, Father and Satsuki
don't think you're a liar.

314
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,740
You must have met the keeper of the forest.

315
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,340
That means good fortune is with you.

316
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,420
But you can't see him all the time.

317
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,380
Sayy, we haven't offered
a prope greeting yet.

318
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,580
Greeting?

319
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,820
Tsukamori! Let's go!

320
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,060
Mei's gotten so heavy.

321
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,860
Father, that camphor tree.

322
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,820
Isn't it huge?

323
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,700
There it is!

324
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,900
Father, hurry. Hurry!

325
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,260
The hole is gone.

326
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,820
Was this really the place?

327
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,220
She says the hole is gone.

328
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,260
Well, you can't see him all the time.

329
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,700
We'll see him again?
I want to meet him too.

330
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,260
Well, if good fortune is with you.

331
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,180
Isn't this a beautiful tree?

332
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,380
It's been here since long, long ago.

333
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,660
Back then,

334
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,820
man and trees were friends.

335
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,620
Father saw this tree

336
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,500
and fell in love with that house.

337
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,620
I'm sure Mother will like it too.

338
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,820
Well, let's offer our greetings
and get back home.

339
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,980
We have to eat our lunch.

340
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,300
Oh yeah.
I was supposed to go to Mit-chan's.

341
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,940
Mei go too.

342
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,860
Thank you for taking care of Mei.

343
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,900
From this moment on,
'Onegai itashimasu'.

344
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,660
Onegai itashimasu.

345
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,540
A race to the house!

346
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,620
Wait!

347
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,220
Hurry!

348
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,660
Wait!

349
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,300
Today I have wonderful news.

350
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,860
Mei met the spirit, Totoro.

351
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:31,340
I'm thinking it would be wonderful
to meet him too.

352
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,060
Kanta! If you don't hurry,
you'll be late!

353
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,300
Attention!

354
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,420
Oh, it's Mei...

355
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,900
Teacher?

356
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:48,940
Yes, Satsuki?

357
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,780
My younger sister...

358
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,180
Granny, Mei...

359
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,820
Well, she says she wants to go where you are,
and she won't listen.

360
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,220
But Mei, today's Father's day
at the university

361
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,260
and you promised to be a good girl
and stay with Granny.

362
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,220
I have two more hours,

363
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,980
And Granny's busy too.

364
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,700
She was a good girl all day,

365
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,540
right?

366
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,540
Sigh... Granny,
I'll go and speak with the teacher.

367
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,340
Satsuki's Mother is in the hospital

368
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,900
and it's rather difficult right now.
Class, we'll do all we can to help, right?

369
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,380
Right!

370
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,580
What's that?

371
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,900
It's Totoro.

372
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,940
Shhhhh. You have to be quiet.

373
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:13,420
Okay!

374
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,860
Tell them I'm going to skip the club today.

375
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,820
Okay, I'll tell the teacher.
See you later.

376
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,620
Mei, let's hurry!

377
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,460
It looks like rain.

378
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,900
Mei won't cry. Is she a big girl?

379
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,300
Yes, but what a problem.

380
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,780
Please let us share your roof
for a little while.

381
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,660
But...

382
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,260
Good thing. Right, Sis?

383
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,180
It's got holes.

384
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,140
Father didn't take an umbrella.

385
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,460
Mei go to meet him too.

386
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,100
And that's why I forgot it!

387
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,980
What dummy would forget
his umbrella when it's raining?

388
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,100
That hurts!

389
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,500
You were probably swinging it
around and broke it.

390
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,140
I didn't!

391
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,980
Excuse me.

392
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,340
Oh, Satsuki. And little Mei, too.

393
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,780
Granny!

394
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,940
Thank you for today.

395
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,660
You're welcome. It wasn't much.

396
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,580
Oh, Kanta lent us his umbrella.

397
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,820
Really? That kid?

398
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,860
It's such a beat up old umbrella.

399
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,060
Mei was with me,

400
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,300
so it really saved us.

401
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,460
But Kanta got all wet.

402
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,460
Thank you. That's all right.

403
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,820
He's always so dirty anyway;
he must have gotten a little bit cleaner.

404
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,460
Are you going to meet your father?

405
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,140
Yes.

406
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,740
Mei-chan, bye bye.

407
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,300
Who came?

408
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,940
I don't know.

409
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,620
There it comes.

410
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,780
Are you getting on?

411
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,220
All right, driver.

412
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,380
Father wasn't on it.

413
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,740
It'll be the next bus for sure.

414
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,060
Does Mei want to wait at Granny's house?

415
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,500
What's wrong?

416
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:23,700
Mei,

417
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,860
are you sleepy?

418
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,820
That's why I told you...

419
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,060
Want to go to Granny's house now?

420
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,820
Hold on, it's just a little longer...

421
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,380
The bus is sure late... Here.

422
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:12,900
Totoro?

423
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,300
Ah, just a minute.

424
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,180
I'll lend you this...

425
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,100
Hurry,

426
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,700
Mei will fall.

427
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,460
Use it like this.

428
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,900
The bus is coming!

429
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:04,140
Totoro took father's umbrella...

430
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,300
Ah, sorry, sorry.

431
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:24,060
The train was late and I missed the bus.

432
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,020
Were you worried?

433
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,500
It came! Father,

434
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,740
it came! It came! A cat, a cat bus!

435
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:35,900
Really huge! With eyes like this!

436
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,380
It was wonderful!

437
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,500
We met him, we met him! We met Totoro!

438
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:45,740
It was fantastic!

439
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,860
Mother,
it feels like my heart is still racing.

440
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,900
Today is a scary day,
but is also a joyful day!

441
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,660
What's more? Totoro's gift!

442
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,140
I was a fantastic, too.

443
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,580
It was a bamboo-leaf package,
wied with a dragon's whisker.

444
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,900
When we got home, we opened it

445
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,740
and inside were nuts.

446
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,460
If our garden became a forest,

447
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:34,500
it would be beautiful, so we planted them.

448
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,020
But they just won't grow.

449
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,140
Every day, Mei says

450
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,900
'Still nothing, there's still nothing'.

451
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:46,180
She's just like
the crab of the monkey-crab fable.

452
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,660
It will soon be summer vacation.

453
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,860
Please hurry and get well.

454
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,380
Satsuki.

455
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,740
Okay, okay.
I'm going to turn it off. Wait.

456
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:11,860
Father,
I wonder if they'll come up tomorrow?

457
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,500
I wonder. Totoro would probably know.

458
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,580
Good night.

459
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,540
Mei,

460
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,500
that's where we planted the seeds.

461
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:55,460
Hooray! We did it, we did it!

462
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,500
Mei, we're the wind!

463
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,220
The tree is gone.

464
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:17,100
We did it, we did it!

465
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,020
It was a dream but it wasn't a dream!

466
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:24,100
It was a dream but it wasn't a dream!

467
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:27,540
We did it!

468
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,620
Mr. Kusakabe,

469
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,220
telegram.

470
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,860
Mr. Kusakabe,

471
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,220
it's a telegram.

472
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,660
Nobody home?

473
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,700
Granny!

474
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:08,220
Over here.

475
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,620
This one's ready to eat.

476
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,820
Granny, how about this one?

477
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,020
It's ripe.

478
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:32,140
Granny's garden is like a treasure-hill.

479
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,300
Say, let's take a little rest...

480
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,140
They're nice and cold.

481
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,660
Start

482
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,100
It's delicious.

483
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,540
Is it? They've gotten a lot of Mr. Sun,

484
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,140
so they're also good for you.

485
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,140
For Mother's sickness, too?
Of course.

486
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,460
If you eat Granny's vegetables,

487
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,060
you'll get real healthy fast.

488
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,540
Mother's coming home this Saturday.

489
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,900
She will sleep with Mei.

490
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,220
So she's finally
leaving the hospital.

491
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:19,780
Un-uh. It's not for good.

492
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,980
She'll return to the hospital
on Monday.

493
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,820
It seems they're going
to release her gradually.

494
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,420
Is that right?

495
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,060
Then we're going to have
to get her to eat more and more.

496
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,660
The corn Mei picked, Mei will give to Mother.

497
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,620
That will make her so happy.

498
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:43,060
A telegram.

499
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:44,420
Nobody was home
so we accepted it for you.

500
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,500
For our house?

501
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,100
Granny,

502
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,620
Father won't be home until evening.

503
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,980
Open it. It might be an emergency.

504
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:02,300
P-l-e-a-s-e re-ply,
shi-koku-yama... Shikokuyama

505
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,620
Hospital!

506
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:05,300
It's form Mother's Hospital!

507
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,260
Something's happened!

508
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,300
Granny, what shall I do?

509
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:13,500
We have to answer! Calm down,
calm down.

510
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,180
Do you know where your father is?

511
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:16,900
I know the telephone number
of the research department,

512
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,540
but we don't have a phone.

513
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:22,740
Kanta,

514
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:30,740
take her to your uncle's.
Let her use the phone.

515
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,220
Mei, you stay with Granny!

516
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,100
Hello, long distance please.

517
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:24,900
Tokyo 31-1382. Yes.

518
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:29,500
Isn't she cute, Kanta?

519
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,100
Hello,

520
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:37,620
yes... Hello,
is this the Kokogaku Research Department?

521
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,260
Father, I mean,
Mr. Kusakabe please.

522
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:43,300
This is Satsuki Kusakabe.

523
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,180
All right...
Oh Father, it's Satsuki.

524
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,180
Yes, what is it?

525
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:55,340
Uh-huh... from the hospital?
I understand.

526
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,300
I'll call the hospital right away.

527
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:58,500
Did something happen with Mother?

528
01:03:58,820 --> 01:03:59,660
What shall I do? Father?

529
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:00,900
Don't worry.

530
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,460
As soon as I find out what it's all about,
I'll call you.

531
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,420
Ask them to let you wait there.

532
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:09,140
I'm going to hang up now.

533
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,820
Granny, may I wait here?
Father will call back.

534
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,300
Of course. Rest awhile.

535
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,900
Sis!

536
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:35,940
No way!

537
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:38,820
This corn is for Mother.

538
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:42,620
I said, no way!

539
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,580
It seems Mother's not feeling well,

540
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:04,140
so they're delaying her home visit.

541
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:05,500
No!

542
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,060
It can't be helped.

543
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:10,180
If she rushes it and gets worse,
what'll we do?

544
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:11,700
No!

545
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,260
It's just a short postponement.

546
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,980
No!

547
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,100
Then it's all right if Mother dies,
is that right?

548
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,220
NO!

549
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:24,820
You dummy!
I'm not talking to you anymore!

550
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:37,540
Let's go.

551
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:43,340
Sis is a meany!

552
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:11,820
Let's put away the laundry.

553
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:15,780
Don't be so sad.

554
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,060
Granny's come to help, so perk up.

555
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:27,660
Isn't your Father at the hospital?

556
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,340
They say it's just a cold.

557
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:34,660
She'll be home next Saturday.

558
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:42,740
It was just like this last time.
Just a short stay at the hospital.

559
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,180
A little cold.

560
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,340
What will we do if Mother dies?

561
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:50,420
But, Satsuki...

562
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:52,780
Maybe she'll...

563
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,660
It's okay, it's okay.

564
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:03,220
Who would die and leave such nice children?

565
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,380
Don't cry,

566
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:07,060
don't cry.

567
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,660
Granny will be here
till your father comes home.

568
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,420
Mei-chan!

569
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:01,100
Mei!

570
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,540
Mei!

571
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:09,900
Did Mei come home?

572
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:12,020
You didn't see her at the bus stop?

573
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:14,820
Funny,

574
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,980
where could she have gone?

575
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:18,940
A little while ago, we had a fight.

576
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:21,020
Because Mei's a...

577
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:23,490
That kid.
I wonder if she went to Mother's hospital?

578
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,900
The Shinkokuyama Hospital?

579
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:29,490
It would even take an adult
at least three hours to walk there.

580
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:30,740
I'm going to look.

581
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,450
Kanta!

582
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:38,660
Hurry and call your father!

583
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,100
Mei's disappeared!

584
01:08:48,450 --> 01:08:50,220
Darn Mei! She's always getting lost.

585
01:08:57,330 --> 01:08:59,250
MEI!

586
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:07,100
Excuse me, Mister.

587
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:12,180
Did a little girl pass by on this road?

588
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:13,660
My little sister.

589
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,540
Hmmmm... a little girl?

590
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:18,700
I would remember if I saw someone...

591
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:21,780
I wonder if it was another road?

592
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:41,940
Are you sure she came this way?

593
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:43,660
I don't know.

594
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,250
Mei!

595
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,580
Stop, please!

596
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:20,180
You fool! That's dangerous!

597
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,940
Your little sister?

598
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:26,700
I think she's on her way to
the Shikokuyama Hospital.

599
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:28,700
Four years old, a little girl.

600
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,100
Ryoko, did you see anyone?

601
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:33,740
Uh-uh. We came from Shikokuyama,

602
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:36,100
But we didn't see anyone like that.

603
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:38,980
Oh. Thank you.

604
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:40,700
Where did you come from?

605
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,020
From Matsu-go.

606
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:43,500
Matsu-go?

607
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:45,580
Isn't there some mistake?

608
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,700
Well, bye.

609
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,780
Satsuki!

610
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:03,900
Kan-chan!

611
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:06,340
Find her?

612
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:08,060
No. How about you?

613
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:10,340
Right now
Dad and the others are searching.

614
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,500
I'll go to Shkokuyama for you.

615
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:13,820
You go home.

616
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,180
Mei tried to get to the hospital

617
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:18,580
and got lost on the way. I'm sure.

618
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:21,300
A while ago, they found a sandal in the pond.

619
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:30,700
We don't know for sure if it belongs to Mei!

620
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:49,140
Did you find her?

621
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:23,180
Nami Amida Buddha,

622
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,100
Nami Amida Buddha...

623
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:26,060
The mud's deeper over there!
Try there first!

624
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:28,340
Hey, got another pole?

625
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,420
Granny, Satsuki's coming.

626
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:44,620
Granny!

627
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,340
This... this is it.

628
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:57,780
It's not Mei's.

629
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,420
Thank heaven.

630
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:13,260
I thought for sure it was Mei's.

631
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:15,780
What, Granny junped to conclusions?

632
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:17,380
Hey, it was a mistake!

633
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:19,860
Where could she have gone?

634
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:21,500
We'll have to start over again.

635
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,180
We'll have to hurry. It'll be dark soon.

636
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,540
Thanks everyone.

637
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,940
Let's divide up and search some more.

638
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:29,580
We we've found...

639
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:58,420
Please let me through to Totoro's den.

640
01:13:58,700 --> 01:13:59,860
Mei's lost.

641
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:01,780
It'll be dark soon,

642
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,900
and that kid, she's lost somewhere.

643
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:34,500
Totoro!

644
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:39,060
Totoro! Mei's lost!

645
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:40,740
I've searched all over,
but I can't find her.

646
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:43,980
Please, find Mei.

647
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:46,540
I'm sure she's crying somewhere right now.

648
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:49,740
I don't know what to do!

649
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,940
Everyone can't see it!

650
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:41,340
Mei-chan!

651
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,780
The trees are leaning out of the way!

652
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:42,060
Mei!

653
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:46,460
Sis!

654
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:50,820
Sis!

655
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:52,100
Mei!

656
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:03,780
Mei!

657
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:07,780
You dummy!

658
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:09,380
I'm sorry!

659
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:15,260
You wanted to bring that corn to Mother?

660
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:28,820
You'll take us to the hospital?

661
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:33,140
Thank you!

662
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:41,980
I'm sorry.

663
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:45,260
It's just a little cold

664
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:47,780
and the hospital
had to go and send a telegram.

665
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,340
The kids are sure to be worried.

666
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:52,540
Poor kids.

667
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:55,660
Well, the kids
will be relieved when they hear.

668
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:58,180
Our good times are just put off for a little while,
that's all.

669
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:00,580
Those kids have to put up with so much.

670
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:05,620
Satsuki's such a sensitive child,
I feel sorry for her.

671
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:07,900
You're right.

672
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:13,580
When I get home I plan to really spoil them.

673
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:22,180
Mother's laughing.

674
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:23,940
She looks okay.

675
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,780
Ah, I've got to hurry and get well.

676
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,140
Who could it be?

677
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:48,740
What's the matter?

678
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:51,340
Just now, in the pine tree,

679
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,660
I thought I saw Mei and Satsuki laughing...

680
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:56,260
It could be.

681
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:57,260
Look!

682
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:00,980
This is for you! (Mother)

683
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:05,700
Totoro, totoro.

684
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:09,620
Totoro, totoro.

685
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:23,260
Someone quietly

686
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:30,540
Sow the rice hull in the path

687
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:37,860
When they grow up,

688
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:41,540
They turn the secret path

689
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:44,900
Into forest.

690
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:51,900
A wonderful adventure will soon start,

691
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:55,940
Totoro in the next door, totoro,

692
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:59,340
Totoro, totoro.

693
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:06,220
They used to live in the forest.

694
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:09,700
Totoro in the next door, totoro,

695
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:13,260
Totoro, totoro.

696
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:17,380
They only show themselves

697
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:21,620
In front of kids.

698
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:26,620
What a wonderful meeting.

699
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:30,380
In rainy days,

700
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:33,540
a fat monster suddenly appear

701
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:39,460
at the bus stop sign.

702
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:47,820
It is holding an umbrella for her

703
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:54,620
This is the passport to the forest.

704
01:21:55,380 --> 01:22:01,740
Magic door will open for this.

705
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:05,540
Totoro in the next door, totoro,

706
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:08,980
Totoro, totoro.

707
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:15,340
It lovely appear in the hillock.

708
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:19,780
Totoro in the next door, totoro,

709
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:23,460
Totoro, totoro.

710
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:27,100
When you meet her by luck,

711
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:35,660
Happiness will befall.

712
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:46,180
~The end~
