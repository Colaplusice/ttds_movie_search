It's a raid!

Hold them off!
Get down on the floor.

What are you waiting for!
Break it down!

7
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,881
Where'd she go?

8
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,382
She's here!

9
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,821
She's hiding out here.

10
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,895
Well, get her!

11
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,233
Mama, I'm falling!

12
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,274
There's the stone.
Quick, go next door!

13
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,700
The crystal.

14
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,212

Working late?

23
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,451
We're finally busy again.

24
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,448
Still working?

25
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:42,957
What's that?

26
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,066
A person!

27
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,154
Pazu!

28
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,069
What are you up to?
Where's my dinner?

29
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,159
Boss!

30
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,073
A girl fell from the sky.

31
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,986
Boss, she fell from the sky.

32
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,160
Darn old clunker.

33
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,600
Boss! A girl.

34
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,729
Close the second valve!

35
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,815
Ouch!
Pazu, toss me a wrench.

36
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,418
I can't let go. You do it.

37
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,992
Don't make them wait.

38
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,921
Keep a steady hand.

39
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:11,640
Brake!

40
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,119
Any luck?

41
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,631
No silver, no tin even.

42
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,997
All that wasted work.

43
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,635
Should try the east vein.

44
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,363
That's riddled with old holes

45
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,442
Have to start over

46
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,574
Time to go home...

47
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,386
Shut down the boiler
Call it a day.

48
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,394
I'll go under at this rate.

49
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,062
Oil the clunker, Pazu.

50
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,850
Mama, I can't see a thing.
It's too dark.

51
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,854
I hope you really looked!

52
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,289
All right. We'll wait for daylight

53
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:14,557
<i>Hi How are you feeling?
Hold on there: :.</i>

54
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,694
I'm Pazu. I live by myself

55
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,330
They eat a fter I play.

56
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,483
So you are human a fter all.

57
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,686
I was a fraid you were an angel.

58
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:48,191
Thanks for helping me.
I'm Sheeta.

59
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,959
Sheeta, nice name. You fell
from the sky. A bit scary.

60
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:57,233
That's right. Why am I still alive?

61
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,870
I fell from the airship.

62
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,469
Don't you remember?

63
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,871
Say, can I see that?

64
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,005
This?

65
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,383
It's been in my family forever

66
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,193
Lt's beautiful...
Wait.

67
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:34,995
Watch this!

68
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,062
So it wasn't the stone a fter all.

69
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,077
Oh, no! Pazu!

70
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,748
Are you OK?

71
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,020
Yeah. Are you?

72
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,221
I'm fine. Sorry, did it hurt?

73
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,731
No, my head's harder
than my boss's fists

74
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,073
The pot's still boiling

75
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,938
Hungry? Let's eat

76
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,777
Wash up over there.

77
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,774
There's a towel.

78
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:51,941
Thank you.

79
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,861
Laputa...

80
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,944
Sheeta!
Where are you?

81
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,845
My father took that picture.

82
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,849
Laputa, an island in the sky.

83
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,017
An island in the sky... ?

84
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,119
They say it's only a myth. .

85
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,927
But my father saw it...

86
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,902
That's when he took it.

87
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:26,604
<i>There's a Laputa in Gulliver's
Travels: but Swift made it up</i>

88
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,337
Dad drew this.

89
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:33,618
He said the abandoned palace
was full of treasure.

90
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,945
But nobody believed him.

91
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,890
Until he died, they called him a liar.

92
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,757
But my father never lied.

93
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:54,766
I m building a real plane.
I'm going to find Laputa...

94
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,217
A real automobile. .

95
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,981
They re pirates!

96
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,920
They attacked the airship.

97
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,458
Are they a fter you?

98
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,084
Quick!

99
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,524
Morning!

100
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,967
Hey, wait!

101
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,338
We're in a rush.

102
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,808
Have you seen a girl?

103
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:34,808
<i>Sure, yesterday...
The boss's kid, Madge: :.</i>

104
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,042
Go away!

105
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,313
They're looking for you.

106
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,290
Louis, a girl's dress!

107
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,916
What! She was disguised!
Tell mama!

108
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:57,967
No, I haven't.

109
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,471
A cute little girl
... brown hair, braids...

110
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,406
Boss!

111
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,011
About that age

112
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,849
That's her!

113
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,258
They're pirates, chasing her!

114
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,960
Pirates! Lemme see!

115
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,534
Not one step closer.

116
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,270
Hand her over.

117
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,164
Dola's clan.

118
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,970
Go home. Just poor folk here

119
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,033
Ma'am?

120
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,237
Scoot out the back.

121
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,506
I want to fight.

122
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,812
They've got weapons!

123
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,345
What a nice girl. Protect her.

124
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,818
You refuse to step aside?

125
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,791
Use your fists.

126
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,418
Could be interesting

127
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,127
Get him, brother

128
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,642
Show your stuf f.

129
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,419
Wow...

130
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,060
Who's going to mend that shirt?

131
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,140
You can beat him!

132
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,048
Go! Go!

133
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,780
Think you can fool me?
After them!

134
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:37,317
Climb on!

135
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:41,888
There you go

136
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,996
Playing hooky for a date?

137
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,696
Bad guys a fter us...

138
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,299
The Dola clan

139
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:53,969
Pirates?

140
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,910
Take us to the next town.
The police!

141
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,278
You're on. Stoke the fire

142
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,146
Mama!

143
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:12,492
You idiots! Hurry up and get on!

144
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,997
What? But the girl's...

145
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,064
She slipped out the back door.

146
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,295
Get moving!

147
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,095
Brother!

148
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,129
Wait!

149
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,658
They're catching up, more steam!

150
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,868
Can't you go any faster?

151
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,135
She's an old-timer.

152
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,676
Move over!

153
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,080
Mama, I'm falling!

154
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,563
More steam!

155
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,634
Here we go!

156
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,607
Sheeta, over here

157
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,011
Stoke the fire.

158
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,052
Don't give up!

159
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,503
Push! Push, I tell you!

160
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,575
Not so fast!

161
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:23,522
Don't let them escape!
Dump this over the side!

162
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,293
Go, go, go!

163
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,389
I'll do it.

164
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,866
No, let me.

165
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,264
Wait!

166
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,741
It's them... what'll we do?

167
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,318
I refuse to give up. Move!

168
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:05,566
This is a surprise. If it isn't the army.

169
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:16,676
These kids need help!
They've got pirates a fter them.

170
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:28,481
Sheeta?

171
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:30,452
Good bye

172
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:31,951
Wait!

173
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,189
Sheeta!

174
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,425
Halt or I'll shoot

175
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,501
An armored train.

176
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,237
Who cares! Smash it!

177
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,712
What is it, Sheeta!

178
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,483
Stay away!

179
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:35,918
They're gonna fall!

180
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,518
Quiet. Watch closely.

181
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,479
We're floating!

182
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,159
Look! Lt's that crystal!

183
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,798
It was the stone after all!
Amazing!

184
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,479
We'll float all the way down.

185
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,227
Amazing! I want it!

186
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:47,661
Shoot!

187
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,067
I have to get that amazing stone!

188
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,530
Lt's fading. .

189
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:23,896
Hey, wait!

190
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:35,074
Just like when you landed

191
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,617
The opening looks so tiny.

192
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:44,154
I hope the Boss and the engineer
aren't in any trouble.

193
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:47,452
Aw, don't worry.
Miners aren't exactly wimps

194
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,652
Let's find the way out.

195
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,762
These mines are ancient.
Tunnels everywhere.

196
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,612
I m so happy I was starving

197
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:18,155
I've still got an apple and some candy.

198
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:22,950
It's like you have a magical bag
that holds everything.

199
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:40,302
Gondoa? That's so far north.

200
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:43,642
Yes. Both my parents died,
but they left me

201
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:47,844
the house and the fields,
so I was getting by alone. .

202
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,833
The guys with dark glasses
kidnapped you.

203
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,105
That guy was one of them?

204
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,283
Who can they be,
calling in the army?

205
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,649
The Dolas and the other guys,
all want the stone

206
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:28,254
But I had no idea it
had mysterious powers

207
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:34,894
It was always in our family.
Mother left it to me when she died

208
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:38,594
She warned me never to show it
or give it to anyone.

209
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,204
We're both orphans, aren't we?

210
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:47,870
I'm sorry I dragged
you into all of this.

211
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:51,574
When you fell from the sky
my heart was racing

212
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:54,183
I knew something
wonderful had begun.

213
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,232
Little demons... little demons.

214
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:14,265
Uncle Pom! He's really great

215
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,361
Uncle Pom

216
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,269
We've lost our way.

217
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,976
Now that little demon
sure looks like Pazu...

218
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,747
with a little girl demon beside him.

219
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,876
Pirates are a fter us.

220
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,415
And the army

221
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,985
How very extraordinary...

222
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:48,704
Drink up.

223
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:49,795
Thank you.

224
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,469
Have you always lived underground?

225
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:00,346
Why no, no. The rocks have
been astir...

226
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:03,553
That's when I like to be down here.

227
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:04,986
The rocks astir...?

228
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,262
Rocks speak very softly...

229
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,364
Wonderful. .

230
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,834
Look up.

231
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,116
They were ordinary rocks until. .

232
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:12,646
How pretty.

233
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,555
Here, let me show you...

234
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,432
It's gone.

235
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:31,167
These rocks contain Volucite

236
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,503
Volucite?

237
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:39,712
As soon as it's exposed to the air,
it becomes ordinary stone.

238
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:46,616
It's glowing.

239
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:52,387
Oh, my gracious!
That's a Volucite crystal, my dear.

240
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,964
I've never seen one before.

241
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:01,197
That's why the rocks were stirring.

242
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,964
This stone has mysterious powers.

243
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:10,709
I thought only Laputans knew
how to make Volucite crystals.

244
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,547
Laputans...

245
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:16,576
They used Volucite to send
a magnificent island alof t...

246
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,949
Laputa did exist, Sheeta!
It really did!

247
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:24,418
Does the island still exist?

248
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,422
Uncle Pom?

249
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:32,899
Dear, would you mind covering the
stone? Its power overwhelms me.

250
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,235
What's wrong...

251
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,817
My grandfather told me.

252
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:55,950
The rocks shif t when
Laputa floats overhead.

253
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:59,756
If you went up to the sky then,
you'd find Laputa!

254
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,462
My father was telling the truth!

255
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,795
<i>Young lady: :.</i>

256
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:13,138
Your stone is most powerful...

257
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:17,981
I know it as one who has
spoken to rocks all my life.

258
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:25,215
A stone so powerful brings happiness,
but it can also bring misery.

259
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:30,557
What's more,
your stone is the work of men.

260
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,486
I just thought I should...

261
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:36,226
It's not true!

262
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,497
That stone's already
saved Sheeta twice!

263
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:43,303
Amazing! Laputa really does exist!

264
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,576
It's gone.

265
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,652
Let's go back to the ship

266
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:59,722
When it's this quiet,
it's best to stay put

267
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,224
<i>I'm hungry: :.</i>

268
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,926
It's all clear Let's go.

269
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,256
Thank you, grandpa.

270
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,994
Look af ter yourselves.

271
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,012
Look at those clouds!

272
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:53,073
Beyond those clouds is an island
we've only dreamed of.

273
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:58,715
Here I come! I know
I'm going to find Laputa!

274
00:36:58,816 --> 00:36:59,805
Pazu...

275
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,785
I haven't told you everything.

276
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:09,055
My family had a mysterious
ancient name which came

277
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,224
with this stone.

278
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:17,190
My name is Lucita,
Lucita Toelle Ur...

279
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:18,792
Laputa...

280
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:19,959
Laputa...

281
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:22,064
So you mean.

282
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,372
It's the army! Run!

283
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,906
Underground!

284
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:37,619
Don't move!

285
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,213
How dare you!

286
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,160
Pazu!
Let me go!

287
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,962
Pazu! Pazu!

288
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:51,562
We've apprehended them

289
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,758
So much trouble

290
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,439
Open up, open up!

291
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:35,968
Sheeta...

292
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,112
Company, fall in!

293
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,506
Shape up!

294
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,415
<i>Squeeze the brat!
: :. She'll talk!</i>

295
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:21,049
Spoken like a man in uniform

296
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,289
In your haste,
you risk everything.

297
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:30,028
If we'd mobilized the army sooner,
Dola wouldn't have had a chance.

298
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,832
She managed to decipher
your third-rate code

299
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,127
How dare you!

300
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,639
My organization will handle this

301
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,645
You concentrate on mobilizing
the troops when the time is ripe.

302
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:48,379
Muska! Remember, I command
the search for Laputa!

303
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:53,848
Of course But I have my
orders from the government

304
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,823
That pencil-pushing upstart!

305
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,407
Have a nice rest?

306
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,483
Where's Pazu? Let me see him!

307
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,246
No interest in pretty clothes?

308
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:28,448
Don't fret about Pazu. His
stubborn head is harder than mine

309
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:32,018
Come, I have something
to show you.

310
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:47,968
Enter.

311
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,020
What is it...

312
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:12,067
A mechanical soldier with vast
destructive power

313
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:16,965
Had he not fallen from the sky,
no one would have believed in Laputa

314
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,793
He's not of this earth.

315
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,958
Our science can't even identify

316
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:43,162
what material he's made of.

317
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:46,932
Look...
Don't be afraid.

318
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,002
He's long dead

319
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,969
Look at that.

320
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,285
This insignia was carved on
your fireplace

321
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:08,517
It's on this stone, too.

322
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,692
The stone works
only in your hands.

323
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:21,531
It will protect you and
guide you back to Laputa.

324
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,304
I know nothing of this!

325
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:29,202
Take it if you like
Just leave us alone...

326
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:38,078
You imagine Laputa's
like Treasure Island...

327
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:42,455
Fearsome powers
thrust Laputa into orbit.

328
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,723
Their dreaded empire
once ruled the earth!

329
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:51,197
Even you can appreciate
that when such an entity

330
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:55,097
roams the skies,
it threatens Peace.

331
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,737
I need your cooperation.

332
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:03,543
You must know how to make
the stone guide us to Laputa.

333
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,911
I really don't know!
Please let me see Pazu!

334
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:14,925
I intend no harm,
but his fate rests with you.

335
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:23,294
The boy goes free
if you assist us, Lucita. .

336
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,732
... Toelle Ur Laputa.

337
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:28,564
<i>But how: :.</i>

338
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,233
Ur means ruler in Laputan,
Toelle means True,

339
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:36,576
Queen Lucita, rightful heir
to the Laputan throne

340
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,589
Out!

341
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:01,760
Sheeta

342
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,639
Pazu, are you hurt?

343
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:06,733
I'm fine. You? Did they
do anything horrible?

344
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:10,074
My dear Pazu, we misjudged you.
Accept our apologies.

345
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:13,075
We didn t know how gallantly

346
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:16,085
you protected her from the pirates.

347
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,584
Sheeta, what did you...

348
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:21,518
Pazu, I beg you,
forget about Laputa.

349
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:23,882
What!

350
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:29,293
Sheeta will aid us in our
search for Laputa.

351
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,794
I understand how you feel,
but forget about her

352
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,798
Is this true, Sheeta? But we...

353
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,500
I'm sorry for all the trouble. .

354
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:39,632
I'll never forget you

355
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,642
I can't believe it...

356
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:43,904
Sheeta, we swore!

357
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,337
Good bye

358
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:46,347
Sheeta!

359
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:48,078
Wait, Sheeta!

360
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,346
Be reasonable. Act like a man.

361
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:52,982
Sheeta!

362
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:05,090
Here's a token of our gratitude.
It's yours.

363
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:46,406
<i>Only you can recall the words
that will waken this stone: :.</i>

364
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:50,603
If you keep your promise,
you, too, shall be free.

365
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,912
Pazu...

366
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:21,908
Mama it's Pazu! He's back!

367
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:25,036
Pazu

368
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:29,317
We were so worried.
You just disappeared.

369
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,482
And the girl?

370
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:33,715
Forget it

371
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,048
Pazu!

372
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,224
Let me go!
What are you doing!

373
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:15,927
Put a lid on it!

374
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,434
Nice place you got, kid.

375
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:19,861
Get out!

376
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,200
This is my house!

377
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:26,602
Oh, come of fit.

378
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:29,473
Can't even protect a little girl...

379
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,503
He's got gold!

380
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:34,811
Sold her for money, huh.

381
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,818
No! I wouldn't do that!

382
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,219
You let them pay you of f...

383
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,049
Sheeta told me to. .

384
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,183
So...

385
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:49,223
So you gave in and crawled home.

386
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,698
You call yourself a man!

387
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,904
You talk big,
but you're a fter Sheeta too.

388
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,902
But of course, we're pirates.
Pirates hunt for treasure.

389
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:05,906
They're the strange ones.
What's the girl to them?

390
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:13,912
You think she'll get out alive?

391
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,389
Sheeta told you to leave?

392
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:24,934
They threatened her,
so she tried to save you.

393
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,136
How do you know, mama?

394
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:30,232
50 years of being a woman.

395
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:34,276
She steels her heart
to save her man. How touching.

396
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,573
<i>Reminds me of my youth: :.</i>

397
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:40,780
You boys want to marry,
look for one like her.

398
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,952
So... that girl...
Will grow up to be mama?

399
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,198
Don't even bother switching codes...

400
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,794
Calling the battle cruiser...?

401
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:14,877
They'll pack her up and take off.
Time is short.

402
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,319
Dinner's over. Move out.

403
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,888
Yes, mama.

404
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,949
Going a fter Sheeta?

405
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,458
I want the crystal, not the girl.

406
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:29,122
The stone's no good
without her

407
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,132
Can't I go with you, Ma'am?

408
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:34,135
I have to help Sheeta!

409
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:38,132
Not so fast. Do it on
your own nickel

410
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:42,511
You're right, if I was clever
and strong, I could've defended her.

411
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,804
Please, I don't care about treasure.

412
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:46,771
<i>Listen to him: :.</i>

413
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:47,872
Shut up!

414
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:58,793
But you could probably
help us with her.

415
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:02,422
Leave all this behind?

416
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:03,521
I know

417
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:04,998
You sure?

418
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,091
Yup!

419
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,365
You've got 40 seconds.

420
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:19,977
Be well.

421
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:31,791
Tie this to your belt.
You boys wait on the ship.

422
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:08,258
A magnificent vessel.
Has the girl come through?

423
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:09,696
I need a little more time

424
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,600
Forget it! We'll squeeze
it out of her up there.

425
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:16,704
We depart at dawn, with the girl.

426
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:39,421
Hurry up, it's almost dawn!

427
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,424
Sheeta!

428
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,256
Whatever shall we do...

429
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:19,968
Sheeta, listen, I'm going
to teach you

430
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,802
a magic spell for trouble

431
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:23,895
A magic spell?

432
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:27,408
Yes. These are old, old, old,
secret words.

433
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:42,017
<i>They mean
help me rekindle the light.</i>

434
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:20,557
Perfect.

435
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:31,767
Just as the ancient books described.
This is the sacred light.

436
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:32,897
Sacred light... ?

437
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:41,975
What are the magic words?
Tell me.

438
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:04,970
It's moving!

439
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,908
The robot it's alive!

440
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:13,840
Hello!

441
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:28,759
Help!

442
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,672
It's alive!
It's the robot!

443
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:45,336
The robot?

444
00:54:58,161 --> 00:54:59,150
It's coming this way.

445
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:05,423
Run!

446
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:15,108
Retreat! Retreat!

447
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,102
Incredible!

448
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:27,584
I see!

449
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:30,748
It's the light!

450
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:34,259
The sacred light broke his seal!

451
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:37,156
This is the way to Laputa! Come!

452
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,256
No!

453
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:00,311
He's going to fly!

454
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,475
It's pointing to the sky...

455
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,973
It's showing the way to Laputa

456
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,285
Hurry!

457
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:08,121
Use explosives!
But don't blow up the ship!

458
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,353
Hello, hello, hello! What is this!

459
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:14,185
Good.

460
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:15,355
We're connected

461
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:19,635
This is Colonel Muska
The robot's cut our lines

462
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:23,134
I've assumed emergency command

463
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:25,872
It's a fter the girl on the tower.

464
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:28,176
Take it down on sight.

465
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:31,371
Prepare to fire.

466
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,051
Hurry!
Hurry up!

467
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,798
Fire!

468
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:19,954
Hurry!

469
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:24,597
We did it

470
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,465
Get the girl

471
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:31,863
Is she dead?

472
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:33,233
Get up!

473
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,276
She just fainted.

474
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,369
Stand!

475
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:40,808
<i>It moved: :.</i>

476
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,691
What's that! Must be a battle.

477
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:33,791
Let's go, Ma'am!

478
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,495
Captain, to you!

479
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,575
Lower, Charles.

480
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:04,600
Stop! Stop it!

481
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:05,994
Please!

482
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:17,672
Mama, Goliath's moving.

483
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:28,148
We're going directly into
the crossfire Regroup!

484
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:29,884
Look, there's Sheeta!

485
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:33,587
Where?

486
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:36,893
Straight ahead, she's
on top of that tower!

487
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:48,706
This is a job for a woman!
Cover me

488
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:02,618
Sheeta!

489
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:06,451
I'm coming, Sheeta!

490
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:08,091
Pazu!

491
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,861
Fly closer, lady!

492
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:16,862
Pazu!

493
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:19,869
Let me go!

494
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,822
Sheeta!

495
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:45,659
Ma'am!

496
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,171
Pazu

497
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:03,947
Pazu!

498
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,537
Climb!

499
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:34,815
Last chance! Grab her on the fly!

500
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:37,708
Pazu!

501
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:39,110
Here goes!

502
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:42,823
Move!

503
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:43,823
Darn!

504
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:44,893
Sheeta!

505
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,201
What's Goliath up to!

506
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:00,733
A smoke screen...

507
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:16,648
Where's the robot!

508
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:18,924
Destroyed. The girl went that way.

509
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:20,017
What!

510
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:29,135
Put out the fire!
Organize a search party!

511
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,879
We haven't lost the sacred stone.

512
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:50,582
Its light points to Laputa. .

513
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:55,655
Inform the General, we'll depart
for Laputa as planned.

514
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:34,963
How nice...

515
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:39,465
I can't believe she'll
grow up to be just like mama...

516
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:47,981
There's your valley...
Back where we started.

517
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,350
Lady, please take us aboard

518
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:57,557
Call me Captain! What use
are you without the crystal?

519
01:04:58,294 --> 01:04:59,352
We'll work.

520
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:02,521
I want to see Laputa
for myself.

521
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:13,536
Don't want any treasure, just
to see Laputa? Suspect motives

522
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,303
for boarding a pirate ship.

523
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:18,712
Are they coming with us, mama?

524
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:21,610
One false move and
you're shark bait!

525
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:25,716
Excellent! No more laundry
or cleaning duty!

526
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:27,448
Or dish washing!

527
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:29,183
Or potato peeling!

528
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,593
Can you make pudding?

529
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:37,688
Yes...

530
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,734
I like mincemeat pie.

531
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:43,739
I eat, um, um, anything!

532
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:48,500
Enough out of you!
When will you boys ever grow up!

533
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:36,246
Get off!

534
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,590
Canvas. It's made of cloth

535
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,063
And don't tear it.

536
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:47,635
Hurry up, it's crowded in here!

537
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:55,740
Hurry, this way!

538
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:58,041
I hate dawdlers.

539
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:00,345
You're with me!

540
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:01,438
Pazu!

541
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:03,241
I don't bite. Come.

542
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,311
You're not here for fun.

543
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:12,885
What an engine.

544
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:17,290
Now where'd he go?
Pops! Pops!

545
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:21,662
Got you an assistant.

546
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:26,208
Don't holler. I hear you.

547
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:32,272
He's tougher than mama. Be careful.

548
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:39,654
My hand doesn't fit.

549
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:42,758
This gasket?

550
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:43,688
Name?

551
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:44,623
Pazu.

552
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:50,630
The crystal pointed
nearly due east...

553
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,766
You sure about that?

554
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:58,405
I could see the sunrise from the tower.
Lt's the harvest season now,

555
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:02,442
so the sun rises just south
of due east.

556
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:05,546
The light pointed to the left
of the sun rose.

557
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:08,173
Good answer.
Any luck?

558
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,843
Not a peep.

559
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:13,513
Blocking their radio transmissions....

560
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,816
Mama, Goliath's faster than us.

561
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:22,592
We're upwind of them. If we get
a lift on the trade winds.

562
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:25,833
This is an Asian calculator.

563
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:28,068
<i>Windspeed is 10: :. And...</i>

564
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,833
I think it'll work.

565
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,103
OK listen up!

566
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:40,911
Goliath's on its way to Laputa.
We're on their tail

567
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:44,343
With these winds,
I expect contact tomorrow

568
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:48,248
Ten gold pieces
to whoever spots her first!

569
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:49,346
Ten!

570
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:55,196
Whatever we find, I m sure Laputa has
riches enough for any pirate gang!

571
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:58,192
Earn your keep, boys!

572
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:17,785
Course 98 speed 40

573
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:51,018
You're useless in that get-up.

574
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:53,346
Wear these

575
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,127
Your station.

576
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:10,994
Sweet...

577
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:21,813
You serve five meals a day.
Go easy on the water.

578
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:32,390
Get to work, you idiots!

579
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:24,968
Yes

580
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:32,245
I'm sorry, dinner isn't ready yet

581
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:35,289
I've never cooked on an airship...

582
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:38,556
What is it...

583
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:42,085
Sweet...

584
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:47,429
I thought I'd give you
a hand in my spare time.

585
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:51,404
Why thank you. Can you
put those dishes away?

586
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:53,265
Happy to obli.

587
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:59,009
You said your stomach hurt...

588
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:01,978
<i>I've got some free time. Can l: :.</i>

589
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:04,910
Move

590
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:07,619
Some stomach ache, jerk!

591
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:09,315
Hey, can I help...

592
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:25,636
You've changed, chasing the likes
of Goliath...  But it's pointless.

593
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:28,471
It's Laputan treasure I'm af ter.

594
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:32,743
They're certainly nice kids...

595
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,078
Get to the point, you crank

596
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:39,644
They're too upright and honest
to ever respect you

597
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:40,744
What's that!

598
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,552
No, I mean...  Check...

599
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:47,419
<i>Good: :. Good...</i>

600
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:53,057
Seconds anyone?

601
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:55,933
Seconds! Seconds!
Seconds!

602
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,285
Hey shake a leg.

603
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:21,319
It's your watch

604
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:23,125
Take it, it's cold.

605
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,388
Watch?

606
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,866
Darn cold!
Go on up.

607
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:42,005
My turn.

608
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:43,209
Great.

609
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,421
Sheeta!

610
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:03,764
That was scary!

611
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,904
Beautiful.

612
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:20,383
Sheeta
Get in

613
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,886
Can t sleep?

614
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,558
Nice and warm...

615
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,722
Look out behind.

616
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:35,625
Pazu

617
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:39,972
I'm really, really, scared.

618
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:43,477
I really don't want to go to Laputa.

619
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:47,071
I hope we never find Goliath.

620
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:52,487
The light really did
point that way.

621
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:55,489
About the robot?

622
01:14:57,593 --> 01:14:59,083
Poor thing.

623
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:04,931
I never dreamed that
little spell could...

624
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:09,802
I learned lots of other spells.

625
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:14,975
To help find things, cure the sick.
And one I must never, ever use.

626
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:16,772
Never, ever use... ?

627
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:18,244
A spell of destruction.

628
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:24,845
I had to learn bad ones so the
good spells had power But not to use...

629
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:28,055
I was so scared, I couldn't sleep...

630
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:32,019
That stone should be locked away

631
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:37,527
They hid it in the fireplace.
Only wore it for weddings

632
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:42,696
My mother's and grandmother's and
great great grandmother's.

633
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:46,240
I should have thrown it away.

634
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:50,411
You're wrong. We only met
because of the stone.

635
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,874
Throwing it away won't
change anything

636
01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:58,946
Airships are improving.
Someone will find it.

637
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:05,022
I don't know what to do, but if
Laputa is so dangerous,

638
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:07,527
it's sure not
for the likes of Muska

639
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,219
Besides,

640
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:13,491
if we run now,
they'll hunt us forever

641
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:16,229
But don't become a pirate for me.

642
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:18,933
I won't become a pirate

643
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:22,974
Dola understands.
She's nicer than she looks.

644
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:27,437
Once things are settled,
I'll take you to Gondoa.

645
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:32,448
I want to see where you were
born, the valley, the yaks...

646
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:34,811
Pazu...

647
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:37,784
What's that!

648
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,258
Below us, look!

649
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,038
Goliath, right below us!

650
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:57,035
Come about!

651
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:30,542
Do we have to hurry?
I hate to lose them.

652
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:33,047
We can't catch them in this fog.

653
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:36,580
We'll get them They won't go far

654
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:39,411
Steady as she goes

655
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:54,101
Farther north than I thought.

656
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:56,469
There's no time, so listen

657
01:17:57,172 --> 01:18:00,369
If we lose Goliath,
it's all over.

658
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:02,705
Follow them in the crow's nest.

659
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:03,800
What do I do?

660
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:07,309
It turns into a glider.
See the crank?

661
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:08,605
Yeah.

662
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:10,082
Turn it clockwise.

663
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:16,885
Once it's locked, the upper
lever spreads the wings.

664
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:25,388
Use the wire to stabilize them.
Figure out how to steer as you go!

665
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:27,734
Sheeta, you there!

666
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:29,961
Get back down here

667
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:31,061
Why?

668
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,337
Because you re a girl!

669
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:38,340
But so are you! Besides, I'm
a mountain girl with sharp eyesight

670
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:39,436
Sheeta!

671
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,573
Please Pazu agrees.

672
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:49,156
Once you're alof t, the voice tube
won't work. See the head set?

673
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:52,583
You mean this...

674
01:18:52,794 --> 01:18:53,886
Wow...

675
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,897
OK. I ll give it a try. Release us

676
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:58,527
Here goes

677
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,646
They re gone

678
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:21,420
Slipped behind clouds.

679
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:24,423
Stay alert. They could be anywhere.

680
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:30,126
Hold on tight

681
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:37,731
What's wrong!

682
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:39,602
We're fine

683
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:42,099
Ran into a gust of wind.

684
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:45,406
We'll keep watch

685
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:47,103
Scared?

686
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:48,204
No.

687
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:51,719
I'm getting the hang of it.
Rough skies ahead

688
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:57,891
Get the rope from my bag, Sheeta.

689
01:20:00,061 --> 01:20:02,029
Tie yourself to me.

690
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,292
The mercury's sinking mama...

691
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:12,362
Lousy luck. Storm coming up. .
How long 'til dawn?

692
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:13,769
One more hour.

693
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:31,516
It's dawn.

694
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:35,492
Strange that the sun's
rising on that side...

695
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:39,431
I know! We're supposed to
be heading east Bridge!

696
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:42,100
What! We're heading north?

697
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:44,138
The compass is pointing east.

698
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:47,800
The shif ting winds must have
put us of fcourse.

699
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:48,841
Look!

700
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:50,935
What is it? Goliath?

701
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:53,545
<i>Lt's a cloud. A huge one: :.</i>

702
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:55,305
A cloud?

703
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:57,543
It's headed for us!

704
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:12,655
<i>A castle in the sky: :.</i>

705
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:16,037
We're headed into
a low pressure system.

706
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:18,662
Turn her away, full speed!

707
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:38,920
It's sucking us in.

708
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:40,722
Hold tight, we can't help!

709
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:49,564
I can't steer!

710
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:52,299
Where's your brute strength.

711
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:54,866
Engine's burning up

712
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:58,346
Stop whining! Do something!

713
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:00,979
We're clearing the clouds!

714
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:09,622
Sheeta, the ocean!

715
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:23,629
The Dragon's Lair!

716
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:26,130
So this is the Dragon's Lair...

717
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:40,150
Dad said, that wind
blew in opposite directions.

718
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:47,060
Look out, a wall of wind!

719
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:49,459
Help! It's sucking us in!

720
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:51,964
Don't give up! Be a man!

721
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:54,365
Bridge! Laputa's inside!

722
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:55,663
What was that!

723
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:58,835
Dad saw Laputa inside
the Dragon's Lair.

724
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:02,567
Ridiculous! It'll blow
you to smithereens!

725
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:03,666
Pazu!

726
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:04,801
Look.

727
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:10,082
Just what we need.

728
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:26,095
Let's go! It's the path dad took.
He made it back

729
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:28,592
Into the Dragon's Lair we go!

730
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,109
Got 'em!

731
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:46,316
Our ship's in danger. Retreat.

732
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:47,649
Stay the course

733
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:51,281
The light's pointing
right for the clouds.

734
01:23:52,827 --> 01:23:55,955
Laputa's in there.

735
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:59,329
Stay the course.
We ll find a way in.

736
01:24:11,813 --> 01:24:13,144
Here we go, Sheeta!

737
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:15,526
Sheeta, Sheeta!
Are you all right?

738
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:22,458
Look...

739
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:38,007
Laputa...?

740
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:41,310
Oops.

741
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:45,187
Wait. I tied it really tight

742
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:50,261
My hands are shaking...

743
01:28:09,817 --> 01:28:10,943
We did it!

744
01:28:30,538 --> 01:28:31,630
Birds...

745
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:34,766
Where is everyone...

746
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:47,254
Coming to greet you?

747
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:49,687
But I don't have the stone

748
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:50,849
I'll use a knif e.

749
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,168
What are you doing!

750
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,269
Wait.

751
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:17,412
Please don't break that.
We need it to get home

752
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:35,425
A flycatcher's nest!

753
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:36,929
He's protecting the nest

754
01:29:42,977 --> 01:29:45,673
I'm glad no eggs were broken.

755
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:47,340
The birds aren't afraid.

756
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:57,219
- Follow.
- You understand?

757
01:29:57,325 --> 01:29:58,417
I feel it.

758
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:24,281
It's a city. .

759
01:30:52,146 --> 01:30:54,614
But we're inside.

760
01:30:58,653 --> 01:31:00,280
You can see the sky...

761
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:14,894
<i>A city so advanced...
Why did it: :.</i>

762
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:16,560
A grave...
I wish I could read the writing.

763
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:20,831
Flowers.

764
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:26,635
Do you tend them?

765
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:30,536
Another robot!

766
01:32:36,017 --> 01:32:38,076
It broke a long time ago.

767
01:32:50,965 --> 01:32:53,160
Must've been the gardener...

768
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:58,264
...who protected this place ever
since the people went away.

769
01:33:13,054 --> 01:33:15,750
You picked flowers for the grave.

770
01:33:18,893 --> 01:33:19,882
Thank you.

771
01:33:22,229 --> 01:33:26,791
Are you all alone? Are there
any other robots here?

772
01:33:52,893 --> 01:33:55,020
He doesn't seem to be lonely

773
01:33:55,529 --> 01:33:59,590
He's got friends and
birds'nests to look a fter.

774
01:34:16,283 --> 01:34:17,307
This way!

775
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:30,730
This section's been destroyed

776
01:34:50,584 --> 01:34:52,176
They got Tiger Moth.

777
01:34:52,286 --> 01:34:54,049
I hope the pirates are OK

778
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:58,291
Look!

779
01:34:58,959 --> 01:35:00,483
They're prisoners!

780
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,125
They hang pirates.

781
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:04,219
We must help them.

782
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:05,354
Let's go!

783
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:13,264
We found a way in.

784
01:35:13,674 --> 01:35:16,370
Mountains of treasure.

785
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:20,274
Wow...

786
01:35:21,415 --> 01:35:23,315
Want some?

787
01:35:23,684 --> 01:35:26,278
I'll give you plenty...  of rope.

788
01:35:26,854 --> 01:35:29,152
Have you reported we found Laputa?

789
01:35:29,256 --> 01:35:30,245
Just about to.

790
01:35:30,691 --> 01:35:33,683
Make the code good and complicated

791
01:35:33,794 --> 01:35:37,025
Hey! No looting!

792
01:35:38,099 --> 01:35:40,567
The perfect distraction for those idiots.

793
01:35:58,185 --> 01:35:59,675
What amazing roots

794
01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:01,579
Can you climb trees?

795
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:05,180
It looks sa fe

796
01:36:38,859 --> 01:36:40,417
How horrible...

797
01:36:41,395 --> 01:36:43,761
If they reach the garden.

798
01:36:44,565 --> 01:36:46,123
The only way to save this.

799
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:51,063
Is to get the stone back

800
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:53,639
I see why the clouds parted.

801
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:57,638
Otherwise they never
could have landed

802
01:36:58,512 --> 01:37:00,275
Was it my spell...

803
01:37:00,748 --> 01:37:04,149
Muska was right.
The seal's broken, and

804
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:07,280
the kingdom's waking up.

805
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:10,647
It's welcomed the visitor
with the stone

806
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:13,650
But Muska will become the king.

807
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,857
He's got much worse in mind

808
01:37:17,097 --> 01:37:21,033
But what do I do with the stone
when I get it back.

809
01:37:22,203 --> 01:37:23,192
<i>That spell: :.</i>

810
01:37:24,004 --> 01:37:27,462
Spell. you don't mean.

811
01:37:55,135 --> 01:37:56,329
I see a way

812
01:38:14,622 --> 01:38:15,646
I'll go first.

813
01:38:35,342 --> 01:38:36,502
It's here somewhere.

814
01:38:47,354 --> 01:38:48,480
Please God. .

815
01:38:54,495 --> 01:38:55,587
This is it!

816
01:39:06,407 --> 01:39:07,396
Lt's that kid.

817
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:12,668
Oh, no!

818
01:39:12,846 --> 01:39:13,938
Don't shoot, capture her.

819
01:39:15,983 --> 01:39:18,781
Well if it isn't the little princess

820
01:39:19,253 --> 01:39:20,982
Sheeta! Shoot!

821
01:39:23,757 --> 01:39:25,156
What is it, Colonel?

822
01:39:25,993 --> 01:39:29,656
The last of the pirates
There's one right under you.

823
01:39:30,064 --> 01:39:31,588
Yes sir! Search!

824
01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:36,525
Wait for me, Sheeta!

825
01:39:37,571 --> 01:39:38,560
Pazu!

826
01:39:42,109 --> 01:39:43,098
Grenades!

827
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:45,110
Must be Pazu.

828
01:39:49,149 --> 01:39:50,138
What was that?

829
01:39:51,585 --> 01:39:52,745
No, it wasn't.

830
01:40:01,428 --> 01:40:03,020
The General is over there.

831
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:06,228
Militia, assemble!
On the double!

832
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:14,329
Ma'am!

833
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:19,335
They've got Sheeta I'm going a fter her
I'll cut your ropes. Escape.

834
01:40:28,555 --> 01:40:29,681
Get out of here

835
01:40:30,257 --> 01:40:31,588
Hey, wait!

836
01:40:34,128 --> 01:40:35,322
Take this.

837
01:40:37,131 --> 01:40:38,120
Thanks.

838
01:40:41,635 --> 01:40:43,364
The boy has become a man.

839
01:40:43,737 --> 01:40:44,726
What's that!

840
01:40:45,372 --> 01:40:48,205
Muska destroyed
the radio equipment.

841
01:40:48,308 --> 01:40:51,243
Yes, while the ship
was short-handed.

842
01:40:51,845 --> 01:40:54,006
Some of the guards
are badly wounded.

843
01:40:54,314 --> 01:40:56,509
The Colonel is in a
black sphere down there.

844
01:40:56,984 --> 01:40:58,315
There's a witness.

845
01:40:59,253 --> 01:41:02,586
That upstart's finally
showing his colors.

846
01:41:02,689 --> 01:41:04,520
Hunt down the spy!

847
01:41:04,858 --> 01:41:05,882
Company assemble!

848
01:41:05,993 --> 01:41:07,517
Hey! Hurry!

849
01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:10,355
Shoot if he resists!

850
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:12,198
Find the entrance

851
01:41:34,221 --> 01:41:36,382
Where are we, Colonel...

852
01:41:36,557 --> 01:41:40,254
Laputa's core. The castle
above is just a trinket.

853
01:41:41,195 --> 01:41:44,722
All of Laputa's knowledge
is crystallized here.

854
01:41:50,904 --> 01:41:52,371
You two wait here.

855
01:41:52,506 --> 01:41:53,768
Colonel!

856
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:57,773
Only royalty may enter
the sacred area

857
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:02,040
What is this!

858
01:42:05,052 --> 01:42:07,111
The roots come this far...

859
01:42:09,623 --> 01:42:12,285
Eventually, we'll burn it all.

860
01:42:12,993 --> 01:42:14,290
Come, this way.

861
01:42:27,908 --> 01:42:28,897
Ow!
I found it!

862
01:42:29,276 --> 01:42:30,368
This is it!

863
01:42:38,252 --> 01:42:39,412
Here, too!

864
01:42:54,868 --> 01:42:55,857
Found it!

865
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:05,876
Behold the giant crystal!
Source of Laputa's power.

866
01:43:06,346 --> 01:43:11,045
Fantastic. It has awaited
a king for 700 years

867
01:43:11,552 --> 01:43:12,678
700 years...

868
01:43:13,787 --> 01:43:17,086
Your family even forgot that?

869
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:26,898
The black rock!
As the epics described!

870
01:43:33,707 --> 01:43:36,039
I can read, I can read it!

871
01:43:37,311 --> 01:43:38,505
Just who are you?

872
01:43:40,347 --> 01:43:44,909
I, too, have an ancient,
secret name Lucita.

873
01:43:45,419 --> 01:43:48,013
My name is Romuska Palo Ur Laputa

874
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:55,523
We are descended
from the same royal family...

875
01:43:56,496 --> 01:43:59,021
. that split in two down on earth.

876
01:44:09,142 --> 01:44:10,666
Not even a crack.

877
01:44:10,777 --> 01:44:12,005
What's the catch?

878
01:44:12,679 --> 01:44:14,510
Deploy all our explosives

879
01:44:14,615 --> 01:44:18,051
Force won't be necessary,
Your Excellency

880
01:44:18,318 --> 01:44:19,649
Muska, where are you!

881
01:45:13,407 --> 01:45:18,538
Why hesitate, General?
Please enter.

882
01:45:19,212 --> 01:45:20,236
Darn it! Follow.

883
01:45:20,347 --> 01:45:22,178
Follow His Excellency

884
01:45:34,261 --> 01:45:35,660
Follow.

885
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:40,397
What is this! Muska, where are you!

886
01:45:40,734 --> 01:45:42,133
Silence.

887
01:45:47,307 --> 01:45:48,740
What on earth!

888
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:55,175
Watch your tongue You're in
the presence of Laputa's king.

889
01:45:55,716 --> 01:45:57,183
Are you insane...

890
01:45:57,584 --> 01:46:03,420
Let's celebrate Laputa's resurrection
with a display of its power.

891
01:46:04,458 --> 01:46:05,447
Sheeta!

892
01:46:05,692 --> 01:46:08,923
Behold, Laputa's thunder.

893
01:46:09,763 --> 01:46:10,752
Sheeta

894
01:46:32,953 --> 01:46:37,185
It's the heavenly fire that
destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.

895
01:46:37,657 --> 01:46:41,184
It's the Ramayana's Arrow of Indra.

896
01:46:41,695 --> 01:46:45,426
The world shall bow down
before Laputa once more!

897
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:52,400
Wonderful, Muska You're a hero.
A monumental achievement.

898
01:46:59,045 --> 01:47:02,446
I've had it up to here
with your stupid face.

899
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:06,784
Run, everyone!

900
01:47:08,021 --> 01:47:09,215
Die!

901
01:47:36,416 --> 01:47:37,713
Lt's those monsters!

902
01:47:38,452 --> 01:47:39,851
Run!

903
01:47:44,524 --> 01:47:46,389
Check our Flaptors.

904
01:47:48,094 --> 01:47:49,425
They're ready to fly!

905
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:50,757
Let's hurry!

906
01:47:50,864 --> 01:47:53,924
Quiet Keep your voice down

907
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:05,339
What are you two doing!
I'll have to leave you behind

908
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:09,842
I advise you not to anger me.

909
01:48:12,385 --> 01:48:15,354
We'll be alone together here.

910
01:48:21,595 --> 01:48:23,187
They should've escaped.

911
01:48:27,834 --> 01:48:29,699
You think you can fight me?

912
01:48:58,298 --> 01:48:59,287
Robots!

913
01:49:35,869 --> 01:49:37,200
Sheeta!

914
01:49:45,946 --> 01:49:47,208
Fantastic!

915
01:49:48,048 --> 01:49:50,209
A marvelous display, no?

916
01:49:52,919 --> 01:49:55,251
Aha, some human garbage.

917
01:49:57,924 --> 01:49:59,016
How dare you!

918
01:50:12,005 --> 01:50:14,599
Be a good girl, give it back.

919
01:50:15,709 --> 01:50:18,177
Please, open!

920
01:50:26,786 --> 01:50:28,777
Just where will you go?

921
01:50:30,824 --> 01:50:32,155
Open it!

922
01:50:51,311 --> 01:50:52,539
Sheeta!

923
01:51:10,964 --> 01:51:12,625
Pazu!

924
01:51:21,875 --> 01:51:22,864
Pazu!

925
01:51:23,276 --> 01:51:24,265
I'm coming.

926
01:51:25,578 --> 01:51:26,567
Get back!

927
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:30,447
Take this, hurry!
Muska's coming, quick!

928
01:51:38,425 --> 01:51:40,188
Throw it into the sea.

929
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,902
Hold onto that stone
I'll trade her life for it

930
01:52:19,899 --> 01:52:22,561
Stand up! No time left for hide and seek.

931
01:52:29,676 --> 01:52:33,874
How delightful that it should end
in the throne room Come here!

932
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:38,376
The throne room?
This will be our grave Ours.

933
01:52:39,953 --> 01:52:43,650
What is a king when his
country lies ruined

934
01:52:44,057 --> 01:52:45,615
I won't give you the stone.

935
01:52:46,126 --> 01:52:49,425
You'll die, trapped here with me.
There's no escape

936
01:52:50,463 --> 01:52:54,331
This is why Laputa died out.

937
01:52:55,235 --> 01:52:58,261
<i>There's a song in my valley. .
Put down your roots in the soil</i>

938
01:52:58,371 --> 01:53:01,670
<i>Let us live together with the wind</i>

939
01:53:01,908 --> 01:53:05,867
<i>Pass the winter with the seeds,
sing in the spring with the birds:.</i>

940
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:12,179
No matter how powerful your weapons,
or numerous your poor robots,

941
01:53:12,285 --> 01:53:14,253
you can't survive apart from the earth

942
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:21,893
Laputa will not die. It will revive.

943
01:53:22,629 --> 01:53:25,189
Its power is the stuf fof
humanity's dreams

944
01:53:27,734 --> 01:53:31,226
Next, I shoot off your ears!

945
01:53:31,404 --> 01:53:35,033
Beg for your life Make the kid
hand over the stone

946
01:53:36,142 --> 01:53:37,769
Wait!

947
01:53:38,545 --> 01:53:42,447
The stone's hidden You can shoot,
but you won't get it

948
01:53:42,982 --> 01:53:46,975
Stay away, Pazu.
He'll kill us both.

949
01:53:47,754 --> 01:53:51,747
I'll spare her lif e if you tell me
where the stone is.

950
01:53:52,859 --> 01:53:56,852
Or do you intend to conquer me
with that cannon of yours?

951
01:53:59,165 --> 01:54:01,099
Let me talk to Sheeta alone.

952
01:54:01,267 --> 01:54:03,827
Don't come.
Throw it away and run!

953
01:54:05,471 --> 01:54:07,234
3 minutes

954
01:54:29,462 --> 01:54:34,126
Sheeta, calm down and listen.
Repeat the words of that spell.

955
01:54:36,202 --> 01:54:37,499
I'll say them with you.

956
01:54:38,705 --> 01:54:40,673
Put your hand in mine.

957
01:54:50,583 --> 01:54:52,676
I cut the pirates'ropes

958
01:54:57,590 --> 01:54:59,490
Time's up. What do you say?

959
01:55:42,802 --> 01:55:46,203
<i>My eyes, my eyes: :.</i>

960
01:56:06,492 --> 01:56:08,323
Mama, it's collapsing!

961
01:56:08,428 --> 01:56:10,419
We've no choice, escape!
Hurry!

962
01:56:10,697 --> 01:56:11,755
Hurry!

963
01:56:23,309 --> 01:56:25,743
Look, the bottom's falling out!

964
01:57:16,629 --> 01:57:19,029
Sheeta was such a nice girl...

965
01:57:19,832 --> 01:57:21,959
They used the spell of destruction.

966
01:57:22,602 --> 01:57:26,003
Those kids saved Laputa
from those idiots.

967
01:57:29,442 --> 01:57:30,773
It's stopping!

968
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:40,376
A crystal! A humongous one!

969
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:42,153
Lt's rising.

970
01:57:48,594 --> 01:57:52,553
The tree... it's carrying
it away Chase it!

971
01:57:52,865 --> 01:57:54,958
You're heavy get off

972
01:57:55,068 --> 01:57:56,160
You're crazy!

973
01:58:39,345 --> 01:58:41,711
The roots protected us

974
01:58:58,097 --> 01:58:59,462
We can still use this

975
01:59:00,366 --> 01:59:01,355
Here goes

976
02:00:11,337 --> 02:00:14,534
What are you doing,
we're not moving.

977
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:17,336
Of course not, we're overloaded.

978
02:00:22,348 --> 02:00:23,542
It's Sheeta!

979
02:00:24,717 --> 02:00:25,877
She's alive!

980
02:00:31,023 --> 02:00:32,149
Ma'am!

981
02:00:32,625 --> 02:00:33,887
Thank God you're alive!

982

You guys OK?

983
02:00:36,295 --> 02:00:40,163
<i>Oh, no! My galleon's wrecked: :.</i>

984
02:00:41,434 --> 02:00:44,892
Oh, stop blubbering.
We'll make a better ship!

985
02:00:45,571 --> 02:00:50,133
You poor child, the worst is
having your hair hacked of f.

986
02:00:50,710 --> 02:00:52,143
That hurts, Ma'am

987
02:00:54,447 --> 02:00:58,247
Pathetic. All that work,
