1
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:50,195
I spoke to Mr. Babbitt on that
just this morning.

2
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:51,856
I'm stiII sitting on four Lamborghinis

3
00:02:51,932 --> 00:02:54,127
that can't meet
the smog emission standards.

4
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:56,294
How many times
you wash out with EPA?

5
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,533
Yes, they're finaIIy cIearing EPA.
Just one or two more days.

6
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:01,768
Three times?
We're reaIIy on a roII here.

7
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:04,538
Four cars, three times each.
That's zip for 1 2.

8
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:06,580
Are you a mechanic
or a NASA engineer?

9
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:09,343
I toId you I've never deaIt with
these Lamborghinis before,

10
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,749
yet you assured me you couId
deIiver within that time frame.

11
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,311
Don't teII me that,
'cause I'm not Iistening.

12
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:17,482
Sir, I hardIy think
that's necessary.

13
00:03:17,558 --> 00:03:20,459
I'II expIain that to my swing Ioan.
I'm sure he'II be sympathetic.

14
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:22,996
I'm into him for 200,000.
That's three zeros.

15
00:03:23,063 --> 00:03:24,997
I've got aII my money
tied up in these cars.

16
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:28,091
If I don't get my money out,
I am finished. You understand?

17
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:30,295
You have to
understand our situation.

18
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:32,999
I don't give a shit. I've got
sharks snapping at my heeIs.

19
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:35,769
They couId've taken the car
and my business 1 1 days ago.

20
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:37,868
I'm under coIIateraI,
for God's sake.

21
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:40,413
I understand, I know
deIivery is way overdue.

22
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:43,006
Fuckin' EPA--
whoIe worId is choking on smog,

23
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,051
and they're gonna
correct the situation

24
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:47,747
by keeping my four cars
off the road?

25
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:50,151
Babbitt CoIIectibIes.

26
00:03:50,224 --> 00:03:53,489
Have you tried cash? How much
can these EPA guys earn in a week?

27
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:55,028
CharIie, it's Wyatt.

28
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:57,158
About the swing Ioan.

29
00:03:57,231 --> 00:04:00,928
If he doesn't get the money by 5:30,
he's gonna seize aII the cars.

30
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:02,332
I'm gonna have to caII you back.

31
00:04:02,403 --> 00:04:04,303
You shouId taIk
to Mr. Babbitt on this.

32
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:06,168
TeII him I signed
a check on Tuesday,

33
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,004
you watched me sign it,
then you gave it to the maiI girI.

34
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:10,236
Come on! I need this!

35
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:11,437
Come on!

36
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:14,709
I wouIdn't do that untiI you
taIk to Mr. Babbitt personaIIy.

37
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:16,943
A number for him?
He's on the road just now.

38
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:18,848
He wants you
to caII him immediateIy.

39
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:21,979
TeII him I'm arriving 1 :30 a.m.,
can he Ieave a number?

40
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:24,551
What, Lenny? TaIk to me.

41
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,788
Mr. Bateman wants to back out
and take Mr. Webb with him.

42
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:29,294
They want their down payments back.

43
00:04:29,363 --> 00:04:31,456
They found two cars at VaIIey Motors,
and they want to go that way.

44
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:33,523
TeII him that was me
on the other Iine,

45
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:37,297
the cars passed emissions, the EPA
paperwork wiII be here momentariIy.

46
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:39,839
- You paying attention?
- I'm Iistening.

47
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:42,808
TeII them I'm knocking off
five grand on both their deaIs

48
00:04:42,876 --> 00:04:44,366
because I appreciate
their patience.

49
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:47,039
- Do you understand?
- I've got it.

50
00:04:49,016 --> 00:04:51,951
Mr. Bateman, that was
Mr. Babbitt on the other Iine.

51
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:54,920
As it happens, the cars
are passing emissions--

52
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:57,514
What am I saying--
the cars have <i>passed</i> emissions.

53
00:04:57,591 --> 00:05:01,118
We're waiting for the EPA paperwork--
we'II have that momentariIy.

54
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:04,164
And because of your
incredibIe patience,

55
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:08,793
we're going to knock off
$5,000 on each car.

56
00:05:08,869 --> 00:05:11,360
WeII, yes,
you've been most patient.

57
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:13,872
We reaIIy appreciate your patience.

58
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:15,431
WeII, thank you.

59
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:16,999
Thank you.

60
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:21,277
Ready for PaIm Springs?

61
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:23,680
You stiII want to go
with aII these probIems?

62
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:26,982
We're seconds away from
cIosing this deaI, cIearing 75 grand.

63
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:28,715
Not bad for
a coupIe of phone caIIs.

64
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:29,847
Not bad at aII.

65
00:05:29,923 --> 00:05:31,413
You know where to find us,
right, Lenny?

66
00:05:31,492 --> 00:05:34,893
Right. I got it under controI.

67
00:05:57,484 --> 00:05:59,452
Listen, I don't want
to be demanding here,

68
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,512
but couId you possibIy say,
I don't know, 10 or 1 2 words

69
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:04,420
before we get to the hoteI?

70
00:06:05,926 --> 00:06:07,655
Consider it forepIay.

71
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:11,029
Can you incIude me
in some of your thoughts?

72
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:13,631
I'm just thinking.

73
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:15,259
Nothing speciaI.
I'm just thinking.

74
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:19,396
Maybe there's something you're
thinking about that we can taIk.

75
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:21,907
If there was something to taIk about,
Susanna, we'd be taIking.

76
00:06:21,975 --> 00:06:24,535
I'm just thinking. What's the big to-do
about me thinking here?

77
00:06:24,611 --> 00:06:28,069
I just feeI Iike I'm going away
for a few days with someone.

78
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:29,308
CaII me crazy.

79
00:06:29,383 --> 00:06:31,817
You wanna taIk, Iet's taIk.
How was your day?

80
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:33,978
- I don't want to taIk!
- No, Iet's taIk!

81
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:37,455
I feeI Iike you're excIuding me.
It's not that I want to taIk.

82
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:40,687
One of these again. How did we
get back to one of these?

83
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:43,821
I don't know why
I put up with aII this.

84
00:06:43,897 --> 00:06:46,559
You wanted to go
to PaIm Springs, and we're going.

85
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,123
But I didn't want to go aIone.

86
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:50,466
I've been sitting in this car
for more than an hour and a haIf--

87
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:52,801
You want to taIk, Iet's taIk!

88
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:55,967
This is not taIking,
this is you going Iike--

89
00:06:56,577 --> 00:06:57,942
Yeah.

90
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:59,342
<i>Charlie. this is Lerry.</i>

91
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:01,938
<i>h've beer tryirg</i>
<i>to cortact you for a while.</i>

92
00:07:02,015 --> 00:07:05,007
<i>h got a lorg-distarce call</i>
<i>from a Mr. Moorey</i>.

93
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:08,748
<i>your father's lawyer.</i>
<i>He's beer tryirg to reach you.</i>

94
00:07:08,822 --> 00:07:10,653
<i>Your father has died. Charlie.</i>

95
00:07:13,227 --> 00:07:15,889
<i>h'm sorry. The fureral's</i>

96
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:18,830
<i>He said you'd krow where.</i>
<i>h've got his rumber.</i>

97
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:21,561
That's not necessary.
Anything eIse?

98
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:24,160
<i>No. that's it. Lister</i>.
<i>if there's arythirg h car do</i>--

99
00:07:24,238 --> 00:07:25,227
AII right.

100
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:32,708
- Sorry about the weekend, hon.
- CharIie, the weekend?

101
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,272
Look, I toId you before, we had
a faIIing out a Iong time ago.

102
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,682
My mother died when I was two.
It was just him and me.

103
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:41,050
We just didn't get aIong.

104
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,520
- You're going to the funeraI, no?
- Yeah.

105
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:46,889
I'm coming with you.

106
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,259
That's reaIIy sweet,
but there's reaIIy no point.

107
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,888
I want to. That's the point.

108
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:55,298
AII right, I'm sorry.
I forgot who I was taIking to.

109
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:17,947
...for our memory,
admiration, and respect for him

110
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:21,927
wiII Iive beyond the years
of his Iife on Earth.

111
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:26,694
Let us consecrate ourseIves
to foIIow his exampIe of zest for Iife,

112
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:31,261
dedication to famiIy,
and charity to aII.

113
00:08:32,272 --> 00:08:36,231
And now, with sure and
certain hope of resurrection,

114
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,871
we commend to you the souI
of our departed friend.

115
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,790
Just have to go over the detaiIs
of the wiII tonight, then we're outta here.

116
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:56,193
Sure, I can wait
in the car if you Iike.

117
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:35,929
Somebody shouId be watering
those roses--they're aII dying.

118
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:40,637
I knew this car my whoIe Iife.
OnIy drove it once.

119
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:43,369
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster
convertibIe.

120
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:47,607
OnIy 8,000 production modeIs made.
Straight-8. FirebaII-8.

121
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:50,673
It was the first fuII year
of the DynafIow transmission.

122
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:53,685
I know it by rote.

123
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,861
You were his onIy chiId.

124
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:16,740
You came aIong when he was,
what, 45 or something?

125
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:20,340
ProbabIy thought he was
never going to have a son.

126
00:10:20,414 --> 00:10:21,938
So he had to Iove you.

127
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:24,006
I think you're exaggerating.

128
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:26,814
You were his chiId,
his son, his bIood.

129
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:29,219
Anyway, in these pictures here,

130
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:31,689
he doesn't Iook Iike a man
who doesn't Iove his chiId.

131
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:33,726
Put that away.

132
00:10:33,794 --> 00:10:36,319
- You wanna hear a story?
- But don't get mad.

133
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:39,797
You know the convertibIe? His baby.
That and the goddamn roses.

134
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:41,026
Buick.

135
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:44,264
The car was off-Iimits to me.
''That's a cIassic,'' he'd say.

136
00:10:44,338 --> 00:10:46,602
''It commands respect.
It's not for chiIdren.''

137
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:48,664
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years oId,
and for once,

138
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:51,540
I bring home a report card
and it's aImost aII A's.

139
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:54,580
I go to my oId man,
''Can I take the car out?''

140
00:10:54,648 --> 00:10:57,674
Take the guys out in the Buick,
sort of a victory drive.

141
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:00,049
He says no. I take it anyway.

142
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,849
I steaI the keys, I sneak it out.

143
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:03,947
You took the car
with no permission?

144
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:05,855
Why? Why then?

145
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:08,360
Because I deserved it.

146
00:11:08,428 --> 00:11:10,692
Nothing I did was
good enough for this guy.

147
00:11:10,764 --> 00:11:11,992
Don't you understand that?

148
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:14,727
We're on
CoIumbia Parkway, four kids.

149
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:17,395
- We get puIIed over.
- An accident?

150
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:19,260
PuIIed over.

151
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,773
- What is puIIed over? PoIice?
- Yes, poIice.

152
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:24,902
Can I finish?

153
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:27,208
He caIIed in a report
of a stoIen car--

154
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,841
not his son took the car
without permission--just stoIen.

155
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:34,080
CentraI station, the other guys'
dads baiI them out in an hour,

156
00:11:34,154 --> 00:11:35,485
he Ieft me there two days.

157
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:38,490
- He Ieft you in prison for two days?
- Two days.

158
00:11:39,693 --> 00:11:41,024
Were you scared?

159
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:43,860
Yeah, I was scared.

160
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,163
Left home.
I never saw him again.

161
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:50,931
CharIie, after a year
we've been together,

162
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:53,404
this is the first time
I've heard this story.

163
00:11:53,473 --> 00:11:54,963
It's strange.

164
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:58,978
How can you keep aII this
inside you and not say anything?

165
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:00,843
When I was a kid and got scared,

166
00:12:00,914 --> 00:12:03,041
the Rain Man wouId come
and sing to me.

167
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:06,444
''Rain'' what?

168
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:10,045
One of those imaginary
chiIdhood friends.

169
00:12:11,258 --> 00:12:14,421
- What happened to him?
- Nothing. I just grew up.

170
00:12:16,863 --> 00:12:18,023
Not so much.

171
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,064
''And I remember, too,
the day you Ieft home,

172
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:25,002
''so fuII of bitterness
and grandiose ideas,

173
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:26,562
''so fuII of yourseIf.

174
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,471
''And being raised
without a mother,

175
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:31,807
''the hardness of your heart
is understandabIe, as weII.

176
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:35,712
''Your refusaI to even pretend
that you Ioved or respected me,

177
00:12:35,782 --> 00:12:37,545
''aII these I forgive.

178
00:12:37,617 --> 00:12:39,949
''But your faiIure to write,

179
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,649
''to reenter my Iife in any way,
has Ieft me without a son.

180
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:45,816
''I wish you aII
I ever wanted for you.

181
00:12:45,892 --> 00:12:47,416
I wish you the best.''

182
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:56,767
''I hereby bequeath to my son,
CharIes Sanford Babbitt,

183
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:58,805
''that certain Buick convertibIe,

184
00:12:58,872 --> 00:13:03,571
''the very car that, unfortunateIy,
brought our reIationship to an end.

185
00:13:03,643 --> 00:13:07,409
''AIso, outright titIe to my
prizewinning hybrid rosebushes.

186
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:10,006
''May they remind him
of the vaIue of exceIIence

187
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,108
''and the possibiIity of perfection.

188
00:13:12,185 --> 00:13:15,279
''As for my home and aII other
property, reaI and personaI,

189
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:18,552
''these shaII be pIaced in trust
in accordance with the terms

190
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,924
of that certain instrument
executed concurrentIy herewith.''

191
00:13:21,995 --> 00:13:23,519
The Iast part,
what does that mean?

192
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:25,360
It means that the estate,

193
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:29,698
in excess of $3 miIIion
after expenses and taxes,

194
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:31,828
wiII go into a trust fund

195
00:13:31,905 --> 00:13:34,567
for a beneficiary
to be named in this document.

196
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:37,610
- Who is that?
- I'm afraid I can't teII you that.

197
00:13:37,677 --> 00:13:41,078
- Who controIs the money? You?
- It's caIIed a trustee.

198
00:13:41,148 --> 00:13:43,639
What is that?
How does that work?

199
00:13:43,717 --> 00:13:46,982
Forgive me, but there's
nothing more I can say.

200
00:13:47,053 --> 00:13:50,216
Now, I'm sorry, son.
I can see you're disappointed.

201
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,848
Why shouId I be disappointed?

202
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:54,485
I got rosebushes, didn't I?
I got a used car, didn't I?

203
00:13:54,561 --> 00:13:56,552
What's-his-name got--
what'd you caII him?

204
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,030
- Beneficiary.
- Right. He got $3 MiIIion.

205
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:02,557
But he didn't get the rosebushes.
I got the rosebushes.

206
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:05,332
I definiteIy got the rosebushes.

207
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:06,565
There is no need--

208
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,040
To what? To be upset?

209
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,399
To be upset?

210
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:15,643
If there is a HeII, sir,
my father is in it,

211
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:19,412
and he is Iooking up right now
and he is Iaughing his ass off.

212
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:22,683
Sanford Babbitt--you want to be
that guy's son for five minutes?

213
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:24,519
Did you hear that Ietter?
Were you Iistening?

214
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:27,059
Yes, sir, I was. Were you?

215
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:31,825
No. CouId you repeat it?
'Cause I can't beIieve my fuckin' ears.

216
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:37,700
I was Iooking for you.

217
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:40,403
How did it go?

218
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:43,708
I got what I expected.

219
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,021
This couId take a few minutes.

220
00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:22,446
- Can I heIp you?
- Yes, I think you can.

221
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:25,245
I have a probIem
with a private trust--

222
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:27,946
- That's a terrific suit.
- Thank you.

223
00:15:28,021 --> 00:15:30,046
My father was Sanford Babbitt...

224
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:40,396
Is this WaIIbrook?

225
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:43,328
Excuse me.
Is this WaIIbrook?

226
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:44,563
Excuse me.

227
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,574
Dr. Bruner is stiII in conference.

228
00:15:54,648 --> 00:15:56,513
WouId you Iike to wait
in his outer office?

229
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,346
No, we'II stay here.
Thank you.

230
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:16,435
Maybe we're not supposed
to be Iooking around here, no?

231
00:16:32,585 --> 00:16:35,713
<i>Good to have you here.</i>
<i>Good luck to all three of you.</i>

232
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:39,054
<i>$20 starts you all off</i>
<i>or a very importart match.</i>

233
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:43,323
<i>hr what 1 980 comedy film did</i>
<i>Goldie Hawr get away from it all?</i>

234
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:44,556
Private Benjamin.

235
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:47,998
Excuse me, pIease.
I want to watch the TV, pIease.

236
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:50,868
<i>For whose grardsor</i>

<i>a swashbuckler keep ir his sheath ?</i>

241
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:32,140
Whatever this is, I don't
understand the point of secrecy.

242
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:34,703
The patient is
an oId girIfriend of my father's?

243
00:17:34,781 --> 00:17:37,147
I knew your father
since you were two years oId.

244
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:38,650
The year my mother died.

245
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:42,051
I'm trustee of the fund, but this hospitaI
receives nothing from that.

246
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:44,849
That hardIy seems fair.
That's something we couId discuss.

247
00:17:44,924 --> 00:17:47,552
I took on this burden
out of IoyaIty to your father.

248
00:17:47,627 --> 00:17:49,185
That's where my IoyaIty ends.

249
00:17:49,262 --> 00:17:51,355
And you think I shouId feeI
a IittIe of that IoyaIty?

250
00:17:51,431 --> 00:17:53,899
I think you feeI cheated
out of your birthright

251
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:56,458
by a man who had
difficuIty showing Iove.

252
00:17:57,003 --> 00:18:00,439
And if I were in your shoes,
I'd probabIy feeI the same.

253
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:03,476
I was hoping you wouId expIain
my father's side of it,

254
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:05,408
heIp me understand
the right in what he's done,

255
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:08,538
because, faiIing that, I have
responsibiIities of my own,

256
00:18:08,615 --> 00:18:11,516
and they have to be met,
even if that means a fight.

257
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:14,348
I'm sorry, this is not your car.
It's my boyfriend's.

258
00:18:14,421 --> 00:18:16,616
My dad Iets me drive
sIow on the driveway.

259
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:17,917
I'm an exceIIent driver.

260
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:19,686
Are you sure
that you drive <i>this</i> car?

261
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,525
There's 28 miIes on the odometer
since I drove it a week ago Saturday.

262
00:18:23,596 --> 00:18:27,032
- ShouId be more than 28 miIes.
- Look, my boyfriend is coming.

263
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:28,700
'Course, today's Monday.

264
00:18:28,768 --> 00:18:31,601
I aIways drive on Saturday,
never drive on Monday.

265
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:34,504
- Who is this guy?
- He jumped into the car.

266
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:35,734
WeII, he can jump out.

267
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:38,539
- I'm an exceIIent driver.
- That's good. Come on.

268
00:18:41,014 --> 00:18:43,710
Why did you Iet him in?
It's not a toy.

269
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:45,148
He says he drives this car.

270
00:18:45,218 --> 00:18:47,652
Dad Iets me drive sIow
on the driveway every Saturday.

271
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,848
'Course, the seats were originaIIy
brown Ieather, now they're pitifuI red.

272
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:53,982
You know, these seats
<i>were</i> brown Ieather.

273
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:57,995
- You know this car?
- I know this car.

274
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:02,462
How do you know this car?

275
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:05,231
DefiniteIy know this car.
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.

Straight-8, FirebaII-8.
OnIy 8,095 production modeIs.

277
00:19:09,342 --> 00:19:11,867
Dad Iets me drive sIow on
the driveway, but not on Mondays.

278
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:13,810
- DefiniteIy not on Monday.

279
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,508

10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

281
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:22,648
That's my address.
What is it with this guy?

282
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:25,223

1 3 minutes to Judge Wapner
and <i>The People's Court.</i>

00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,529
Hey, I'm taIking to you!

Raymond is your brother.

291
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:52,541
My brother?
I don't have a brother.

- Not exactIy.

- But he's here.
- He's an autistic savant.

302
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:21,336
I don't know what that means.

303
00:20:21,414 --> 00:20:23,882
Some peopIe Iike him used

304

They have certain deficiencies,
certain abiIities.

- Yeah, but he's retarded.
- Autistic. ActuaIIy, high-functioning.

What does that mean?

307
00:20:32,592 --> 00:20:34,423
It means there's a disabiIity

308
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:37,622
that impairs the sensory input
and how it's processed.

He can't even express himseIf

<i>the dog laid dowr...</i>

315
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:57,513
There are dangers
everywhere for Raymond.

316
00:20:57,584 --> 00:21:00,781
Routines, rituaIs--
it's aII he has to protect himseIf.

317
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:03,014
RituaIs. That's a good one.

318
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:07,423
It's the way he acts, sIeeps, eats,

319
00:21:07,493 --> 00:21:10,018
uses the bathroom,
waIks, taIks, everything.

320
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:12,690
Any break from
the routines, and it's terrifying.

00:21:12,765 --> 00:21:15,996
- How Iong has he been here?
- WeII, I came here in 1960.

322
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:17,468
No, how oId is he?

323
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:20,097
He was 1 8 or 20 then.
I'd have to check records--

324
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:23,404
- You've been here that Iong?
- That's when I actuaIIy started.

325
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:26,809
'65, '75, '85--
I was aImost three years oId.

326
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:29,848
You knew he had a brother,
you knew I was his brother.

327
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,406
Yes, but what's the point?

328
00:21:31,484 --> 00:21:33,679
What's the point?
What's the fuckin' point?

329
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:35,744
Why didn't anybody teII me
I had a brother?

330
00:21:35,822 --> 00:21:37,255
What wouId you have done about it?

331
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,285
I don't know.

332
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:45,758
Does he know
how much money he's been Ieft?

333
00:21:45,832 --> 00:21:48,027
He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

334
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:52,732
He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

335
00:21:52,805 --> 00:21:54,898
He's just inherited $3 miIIion,

336
00:21:54,974 --> 00:21:57,636
and he doesn't understand
the concept of money?

337
00:21:58,811 --> 00:22:02,042
That is fucking poetic,
don't you think?

338
00:22:04,484 --> 00:22:05,644
Good oId Dad.

339
00:22:06,686 --> 00:22:08,119
Who's pIaying first? Yes.

340
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:10,178
The feIIow's name
on first base. Who.

341
00:22:10,256 --> 00:22:12,918
The feIIow pIaying
first base for St. Louis. Who.

342
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,789
What is this?
Why is he doing that?

343
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:17,386
Whenever he gets nervous,
he does ''Who's On First?''

344
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:19,693
- From Abbott and CosteIIo.
- Why?

345
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:23,065
It's his way of deaIing with you
touching his books and stuff.

346
00:22:23,136 --> 00:22:25,070
So he memorized
''Who's On First?''

347
00:22:25,138 --> 00:22:26,867
Yeah, that among other things.

348
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:28,907
Raymond,
Ted KIuszewski.

349
00:22:28,975 --> 00:22:32,843
Ted KIuszewski,
Big KIew, first base.

350
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:34,277
He pIayed for Cincinnati.

351
00:22:34,347 --> 00:22:36,611
'Course, he was traded
for Dee Fondy, 1957.

352
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:39,846
- Lifetime batting average .298.
- AII these books. He reads, huh?

353
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,752
Reads and remembers
whatever he gets his hands on.

354
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:49,150
V-E-R-N! 'Course, these peopIe
are gonna be here aII day.

355
00:22:49,228 --> 00:22:51,219
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

356
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:54,095
This is definiteIy
not a weekend visit, Vern.

357
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:56,601
He's getting anxious.
It's okay, Ray!

358
00:22:58,738 --> 00:23:00,797
V-E-R-N, this is
an unannounced visit.

359
00:23:00,873 --> 00:23:03,137
Put it back. He said
not to touch the books.

360
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:04,301
Not to touch books.

361
00:23:04,377 --> 00:23:06,311
- You Iike Shakespeare?
- I don't know.

362
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:08,643
- Did you read aII this?
- I don't know. Vern.

363
00:23:08,715 --> 00:23:10,615
- Did you read <i>Macbeth ?</i>
- I don't know.

364
00:23:10,683 --> 00:23:12,344
- You read <i>Hamlet?</i>
- I don't know.

365
00:23:12,418 --> 00:23:14,249
- The <i>Twelfth Night?</i>
- Stop it!

366
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,753
- Yes.
- Yes?

367
00:23:15,822 --> 00:23:18,518
You read aII the stories
that are in this book,

368
00:23:18,591 --> 00:23:20,525
and you don't know if
you read the book?

369
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:22,652
- I don't know. V-E-R-N.
- You don't know?

370
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:23,855
Maybe you better put it back.

371
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:28,030
You don't know. Okay.
No, Ray, take it easy.

372
00:23:28,101 --> 00:23:31,537
I'm not going to--
I won't touch anything eIse.

373
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:35,366
It's ok, Ray. It's okay.
Come on. My main man.

374
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:38,501
Vern, my main man.
My main man, Vern.

375
00:23:38,578 --> 00:23:39,738
It's okay, Ray.

376
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,314
- My main man.
- Yeah, my main man.

377
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:46,180
Here are your cards.

378
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:48,516
I'm sorry, I didn't know where
you want me to put them.

379
00:23:48,588 --> 00:23:51,079
Are you taking any
prescription medication?

380
00:23:54,894 --> 00:23:57,294
He Iikes you.
That's just his way of showing it.

381
00:23:58,297 --> 00:24:00,561
When I touched him before,
he puIIed away.

382
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:03,193
Don't take it personaI.
He never touched me.

383
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:05,430
I'm cIoser to him
than anybody in the worId.

384
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:08,167
Known him for nine years.
It's not in him.

385
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,309
If I Ieft town tomorrow
and didn't say goodbye,

386
00:24:11,377 --> 00:24:12,674
he'd never notice.

387
00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:14,474
He wouIdn't notice if you Ieave?

388
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:17,539
I'm not sure, but I don't think
peopIe are his first priority.

389
00:24:18,618 --> 00:24:21,314
Hey, Ray, you want
to go take a waIk?

390
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:28,518
Can he hear us
when he's Iike that?

391
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:30,858
You wanna show
your brother your ducks?

392
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,262
'Course, it's
27 minutes to <i>Jeopardy!</i>

393
00:24:33,332 --> 00:24:35,994
Don't worry, Ray,
we'II bring you right back.

394
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:38,832
PracticaIIy
26 minutes to <i>Jeopardy!</i>

395
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:41,874
- We'II bring him right back.
- 26 minutes to <i>Jeopardy!</i>

396
00:24:41,941 --> 00:24:44,375
I won't do it.
I won't do it!

397
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:49,244
First of aII, because of your
tone of voice, this commanding--

398
00:24:49,315 --> 00:24:51,249
You're upset. Just caIm down.

399
00:24:51,317 --> 00:24:53,683
Raymond, I'm going
to taIk to Susanna aIone.

400
00:24:53,753 --> 00:24:54,811
Goodbye, Raymond.

401
00:24:54,887 --> 00:24:57,617
Just hoId on.
I'II be right back.

402
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,352
No, just stay.
Just stay there.

403
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:06,295
Just stay there.
Just stand stiII, okay?

404
00:25:06,365 --> 00:25:07,992
That's good.

405
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:11,400
I'II do it if you teII me why--
why do I do--

406
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:14,094
What?

407
00:25:14,173 --> 00:25:16,607
Why do I have to take the car
and go down there,

408
00:25:16,676 --> 00:25:18,507
and wait for you again at the gate?

409
00:25:18,578 --> 00:25:21,103
I've been waiting
for you for days. Why?

410
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,172
It's for Raymond.
The car disturbs him.

411
00:25:25,585 --> 00:25:27,075
- That's why?
- That's why.

412
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,633
What are you Iooking at?
The ducks are over here.

413
00:25:43,703 --> 00:25:44,863
I don't know.

414
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,872
Listen, our father died.

415
00:25:50,943 --> 00:25:53,002
Did you know that he died Iast week,
did they teII you that?

416
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,137
I don't know.

417
00:25:54,213 --> 00:25:56,943
You don't know if they toId you,
or you don't know what dead is?

418
00:25:59,118 --> 00:26:01,916
That means he's gone.
He's at the cemetery.

419
00:26:01,988 --> 00:26:04,252
You want to go see him
at the cemetery, Ray?

420
00:26:04,323 --> 00:26:05,415
I don't know.

421
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:07,652
Does that mean maybe?
Maybe you wanna go?

422
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:08,887
I don't know.

423
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:13,491
I Iive in Los AngeIes.

424
00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:16,729
I thought maybe
you'd Iike to see a Dodger game.

425
00:26:16,802 --> 00:26:20,169
Go see the Dodgers pIay.

426
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:22,400
- Today's an off day.
- We don't have to go today.

427
00:26:22,475 --> 00:26:23,806
Monday. No games scheduIed.

428
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:26,504
Just thought you'd Iike
to go to Los AngeIes with me,

429
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:28,240
go see Fernando VaIenzueIa pitch.

430
00:26:28,314 --> 00:26:31,306
VaIenzueIa pitched Saturday.
Not scheduIed to pitch tiII Wednesday.

431
00:26:31,384 --> 00:26:32,874
He's gonna pitch on Wednesday?

432
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:35,684
I'm not doing anything
on Wednesday.

433
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:37,586
- Yeah, Wednesday.
- Let's go to L.A.

434
00:26:39,358 --> 00:26:40,347
Come on, Ray.

435
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:44,856
'Course, it's a Iong way to CaIifornia.

436
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:48,594
I'm definiteIy not supposed to be
off the grounds for more than two hours.

437
00:26:48,668 --> 00:26:50,659
DefiniteIy have to
be back in two hours.

438
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:53,762
Wait tiII you get there. The peopIe,
crowds cheering. You'II Iove it.

439
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,329
Have to be back in two hours.

440
00:28:35,141 --> 00:28:38,269
- The PresidentiaI Suite.
- Dinner's at 6:30 p.m.

441
00:28:38,344 --> 00:28:41,370
To the Ieft is Raymond's room.
Look at this beautifuI room.

442
00:28:41,447 --> 00:28:43,779
This is definiteIy not my room.

443
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:45,180
It's just for tonight.

444
00:28:45,251 --> 00:28:47,242
Have to go back
to WaIIbrook for dinner.

445
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,549
LittIe guy!
This is gonna be terrific.

446
00:28:49,622 --> 00:28:51,920
Dr. Bruner wants us
to spend time together.

447
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:53,117
We're gonna have fun.

448
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:55,057
- What did he say?
- He said that.

449
00:28:55,127 --> 00:28:57,960
I don't have my tapioca pudding.
We have tapioca pudding for dessert.

450
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,590
We can do that.
I'm gonna caII Lenny.

451
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:03,691
This is definiteIy not my room,
and I don't have my pudding,

452
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:05,760
and the bed's in the wrong pIace.

453
00:29:05,838 --> 00:29:06,827
You can move it.

454
00:29:06,906 --> 00:29:09,397
- Where do you want the bed?
- ShouId be near the window.

455
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:14,107
'Course, I don't have my books.
'Course, there's no booksheIves.

456
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,479
I'm definiteIy out of books.
I'm gonna be bookIess.

457
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,847
Here's a book.

458
00:29:18,918 --> 00:29:21,443
Big teIephone book,
Iot of words.

459
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,488
Lenny, pick up, wiII you?

460
00:29:23,556 --> 00:29:25,456
I got $200,000 about to
go in the shithouse,

461
00:29:25,524 --> 00:29:27,048
and he doesn't wanna
answer the phone.

462
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:29,890
What is it--6:00 here,
that means it's 9:00 there.

463
00:29:29,962 --> 00:29:32,192
- No, it's 3:00 there.
- 6:30 p.m. is dinner.

464
00:29:32,264 --> 00:29:35,199
It's 3:00 there. He doesn't
want to answer the phone?

465
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:37,258
Orange soda.

466
00:29:38,304 --> 00:29:40,363
Has to be in a can with a straw.

467
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:43,272
Bruner toId you
that you shouId do this?

468
00:29:43,342 --> 00:29:46,334
- It doesn't make sense.
- I know what's good for him.

469
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:08,693
V-E-R-N!

470
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:11,600
God. Go see
what he's doing, wiII you?

471
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:18,105
- What is it?
- What's happening, homes?

472
00:30:18,177 --> 00:30:21,442
Everything is fine.
CharIie, Iet's take him home.

473
00:30:21,514 --> 00:30:25,075
He's okay. We'II just get him
some dinner, he'II be aII right.

474
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:27,312
What'd you say--
you wanted hamburger?

475
00:30:28,921 --> 00:30:31,412
We have pepperoni pizza
Monday night for dinner.

476
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,981
Pizza? You get pizza
in the institution?

477

00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:44,160
Where is he?
I got a bit of a IegaI probIem.

<i>He's out of towr</i>

00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:48,470
AII right, I'II caII him tomorrow.

484
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:55,078
No TV during dinnertime.
DefiniteIy not.

485
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:57,479
We can watch TV here.
We can. We're aIIowed.

486
00:31:01,086 --> 00:31:03,281
''<i>Wheel of Forture!</i>

Pepperoni, right?

496
00:31:35,588 --> 00:31:36,987
I don't want pepperoni.

497
00:31:37,056 --> 00:31:38,990
That's right.
A Iarge pepperoni.

- How Iong's that going to take?
<i>- 20 mirutes.</i>

Just bring the cIosest thing.

Here, Ray. Take this.
Food is coming shortIy.

'Course, I'm going to be here

I'm gone for good from my home.

What is that?

507
00:33:39,712 --> 00:33:41,703
I think Raymond is in the room.

508
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,010
What? Raymond,
are you in here?

509
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:48,752
WeII, get out! Get out!

510
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:50,482
- Go!
- Stop it!

511
00:33:53,926 --> 00:33:54,915
Jesus--

512
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:56,824
Stop it.
Go in there with him.

513
00:33:56,895 --> 00:33:59,227
Come on, go in there.
He's your brother.

514
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:01,789
He's afraid.
He doesn't understand this.

515
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:03,858
Come on, go in there!

516
00:34:08,974 --> 00:34:11,135
Raymond, what were
you doing in my room?

517
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,871
What were you
doing in my room?

518
00:34:12,945 --> 00:34:15,004
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

519
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,570
'Course, there were noises.

520
00:34:16,648 --> 00:34:20,482
Those noises are none of
your business, you understand?

521
00:34:20,552 --> 00:34:21,849
Put the phone book down,

522
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,581
stop acting Iike an idiot,
and go to sIeep.

523
00:34:24,423 --> 00:34:27,119
Did you hear what I said?
Go to sIeep! Go to sIeep!

524
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:29,524
It's nine minutes to 1 1 :00
Lights out at 1 1 :00.

525
00:34:29,595 --> 00:34:30,926
WeII, new ruIes.

526
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,810
You don't Iisten to me!
You don't Iisten to me!

527
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,278
What are you taIking about?

528
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:51,942
I asked you to go apoIogize.
You went and insuIted him again!

529
00:34:52,017 --> 00:34:54,451
What am I supposed to do,
tuck him in? I'm not his mother.

530
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,351
You're his brother.
His brother!

531
00:34:56,422 --> 00:34:58,947
They teII you today
that you have a brother,

532
00:34:59,024 --> 00:35:01,424
and I don't see in your face
one IittIe reaction.

533
00:35:01,493 --> 00:35:03,620
I'm not saying joy,
I'm saying <i>somethirg.</i>

534
00:35:03,695 --> 00:35:05,390
You don't know what
I'm going through here.

535
00:35:05,464 --> 00:35:07,796
No, I don't know
what you're going through.

536
00:35:07,866 --> 00:35:10,562
I don't know because
you don't teII me anything.

537
00:35:10,636 --> 00:35:12,297
You just give me Iies.

538
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:14,202
Lies? What Iies?

539
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:17,765
This thing that Dr. Bruner asked you
to bring him here, this is buIIshit.

540
00:35:17,843 --> 00:35:21,006
I know it's not true.
Why don't you teII me why he's here?

541
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,377
Because I'm pissed at him.
At my father.

542
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:26,009
You're pissed at your father,
and you bring Raymond here. Why?

543
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:28,018
'Cause I got him
and they want him.

544
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:29,178
This makes no sense!

545
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:31,586
Raymond was Ieft aII the money,
and I got nothing.

546
00:35:31,657 --> 00:35:34,820
$3 miIIion. The inheritance,
every penny of it.

547
00:35:34,893 --> 00:35:37,623
I'm gonna keep him tiII
I get my haIf! I deserve that!

548
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,359
What is this?

549
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,438
- Just take it easy.
- I've had enough.

550
00:35:46,505 --> 00:35:48,370
You've had enough?
What does that mean?

551
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,600
I'm Ieaving.

552
00:35:49,675 --> 00:35:52,667
You're Ieaving?
You're Ieaving me now? I need you.

553
00:35:52,744 --> 00:35:55,406
What? You need nobody.

554
00:35:55,481 --> 00:35:56,812
What does that mean?

555
00:35:56,882 --> 00:36:00,648
What? Just take it easy.
What is my crime here?

556
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:03,210
Your crime
is that you use peopIe!

557
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:05,552
You're using Raymond!
You're using me!

558
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:06,955
You use everybody.

559
00:36:07,025 --> 00:36:08,356
I'm using Raymond?

560
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:10,657
Am I using you?
Am I using you, Raymond?

561
00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:11,753
- Yeah.
- Shut up!

562
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,526
He is answering a question
from a haIf-hour ago!

563
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,192
What good is $3 miIIion to him?

564
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:18,930
That money is onIy just gonna
sit there the rest of his Iife.

565
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:20,494
And you know I need that money!

566
00:36:20,572 --> 00:36:22,733
You need it,
so it's hardIy Iike steaIing!

567
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:24,742
And when it's over,
what happens to Raymond?

568
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,471
He'II go back to WaIIbrook,

569
00:36:26,545 --> 00:36:28,172
or with the money,
I wiII put him in a better pIace.

570
00:36:28,247 --> 00:36:31,080
What difference does it make?
He is gonna be just the same!

571
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:32,639
OnIy you'II have his money!

572
00:36:32,718 --> 00:36:34,777
His money?
That man was my father, too.

573
00:36:34,853 --> 00:36:37,686
What about my fucking haIf?
I'm entitIed to that money!

574
00:36:37,756 --> 00:36:39,246
You've kidnapped this man!

575
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:42,555
I did not take him.
I took my haIf.

576
00:36:42,628 --> 00:36:45,358
- Which haIf? You're crazy!
- It runs in the famiIy.

577
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:48,729
You're soaking wet and you're
gonna Ieave in the middIe of the night.

578
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,463
Just wait! My father has
stuck it to me aII my Iife.

579
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:54,005
What do you want from me?

580
00:36:54,072 --> 00:36:55,403
Out.

581
00:37:47,793 --> 00:37:51,285
- Stop it.
- Good morning. Coffee?

582
00:37:51,363 --> 00:37:52,853
Yes.
That'd be great.

583
00:37:52,931 --> 00:37:54,296
SaIIy Dibbs.

584
00:37:54,366 --> 00:37:58,268
Dibbs, SaIIy.
461-0192.

585
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:00,866
How did you know
my phone number?

586
00:38:01,974 --> 00:38:03,134
How'd you know that?

587
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:07,372
You said read the teIephone book.
Dibbs, SaIIy. 461-0192.

588
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:12,007
He remembers things,
IittIe things sometimes.

589
00:38:12,084 --> 00:38:14,746
Very cIever, boys.
I'II be right back.

590
00:38:15,854 --> 00:38:17,344
How'd you do that?

591
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:19,686
- I don't know.
- You memorized the whoIe book.

592
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:20,747
No.

593
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:23,090
You start from the beginning?
How far did you get?

594
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:26,494
''G.'' Gottsaken.
WiIIiam MarshaII Gottsaken.

595
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:29,033
- You memorized to ''G''?
- Yeah, ''G.''

596
00:38:30,235 --> 00:38:31,725
A, B, C, D, E, F, G?

597
00:38:31,803 --> 00:38:33,293
G. HaIf of ''G.''

598
00:38:35,707 --> 00:38:36,867
That's good, Ray.

599
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:38,736
I Iike that.

600
00:38:42,547 --> 00:38:45,380
- We hungry?
- Tuesday we have pancakes.

601
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,782
-That sounds good.
- With mapIe syrup.

602
00:38:47,853 --> 00:38:49,684
- Bet your butt.
- Bet your butt.

603
00:38:52,257 --> 00:38:53,588
They got pancakes.

604
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,650
What is this, Ray?

605
00:38:56,728 --> 00:38:58,662
'Course, I don't have
my toothpicks.

606
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,220
You don't need toothpicks.

607
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:02,960
That was okay in the hoteI
Iast night with the pizza,

608
00:39:03,035 --> 00:39:04,366
but in a restaurant,
you use a fork.

609
00:39:04,436 --> 00:39:05,767
I don't have my toothpicks.

610
00:39:05,837 --> 00:39:08,897
Pancakes keep sIiding off.
You're gonna eat with a fork.

611
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:10,635
I don't have mapIe syrup, either.

612
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:13,041
I'm gonna be without my mapIe syrup
and my toothpicks.

613
00:39:13,111 --> 00:39:14,942
You don't see
any pancakes, do you?

614
00:39:15,013 --> 00:39:17,413
'Course, the probIem is,
mapIe syrup is not here.

615
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:21,248
When we order the pancakes,
they're gonna bring the mapIe syrup.

616
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:24,482
MapIe syrup is supposed to be
on the tabIe before the pancakes.

617
00:39:24,556 --> 00:39:25,887
We haven't ordered yet.

618
00:39:25,957 --> 00:39:29,222
When they bring it after,
it'II definiteIy be too Iate.

619
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:32,923
How is that gonna be too Iate?
We haven't ordered pancakes yet.

620
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:35,159
If we're gonna be here
the entire morning

621
00:39:35,233 --> 00:39:37,497
with no mapIe syrup
and no toothpicks,

622
00:39:37,569 --> 00:39:41,471
I'm definiteIy not gonna have
my pancakes with--

623
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:43,972
Don't make a scene.

624
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:46,033
Stop acting Iike a fucking retard.

625
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:10,629
What are you writing?

626
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,331
What the fuck is this?

627
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:17,364
''Serious...serious injury Iist''?

''CharIie Babbitt.

629
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:21,475
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

630
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:24,982
''Number 1 8 in 1988.

Squeezed and puIIed

- Dr. Bruner, it's CharIie Babbitt.
- <i>Where are you. sor ?</i>

00:49:51,015 --> 00:49:53,848
Whatever that might be.
Is that an idea?

806
00:49:53,918 --> 00:49:55,977
Give me five.
That's a great idea.

807
00:49:56,054 --> 00:49:57,043
Gimme five.

808
00:49:57,121 --> 00:49:58,918
This guy's a fucking fruitcake.

809
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:00,981
AII right.
Let's move out!

810
00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:03,357
<i>They've got two more urits...</i>

811
00:50:03,428 --> 00:50:05,259
<i>The fire departmert's coverirg it.</i>

812
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:07,127
<i>They've got two more urits...</i>

813
00:50:07,198 --> 00:50:09,860
I'm asking who's on first.
That's the man's name.

814
00:50:09,934 --> 00:50:11,265
That's whose name? Yes.

815
00:50:11,336 --> 00:50:13,236
Then go ahead

00:50:14,672 --> 00:50:16,572
The first baseman.
Who is on first.

818
00:50:16,641 --> 00:50:19,303
Who is? Yes.

819
00:50:19,377 --> 00:50:21,208
After aII, the man earns it.

820
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:22,610
Who does? AbsoIuteIy.

821
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,843
AII I'm trying to find out is
what's the guy's name on first base?

822
00:50:25,917 --> 00:50:27,578
No, no.
What is on second base.

823
00:50:27,652 --> 00:50:29,313
I'm not asking who's on second.

824
00:50:29,387 --> 00:50:32,151
Who's on first?
That's what I'm trying to find out.

825
00:50:32,223 --> 00:50:33,554
Get the heII in the car!

826
00:50:33,624 --> 00:50:36,422
Yeah, get in the car.
Get in the car, yeah.

827
00:50:36,494 --> 00:50:38,485
'Course, I have
to be in bed by 1 1 :00.

828
00:50:38,563 --> 00:50:40,895
Lights out at 1 1 :00.
Have to watch TV.

829
00:50:46,938 --> 00:50:49,236
'Course, now it's aImost
19 minutes to 1 1 :00.

830
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:50,797
I have to be in bed at 1 1 :00.

831
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:53,207
We're not fIying,
we're not on the interstate.

832
00:50:53,277 --> 00:50:55,108
We're on some
shit secondary road.

833
00:50:55,179 --> 00:50:57,875
I gotta make up some time,
get to Los AngeIes.

834
00:50:57,949 --> 00:51:00,281
My business needs me.
I gotta make up some time.

835
00:51:00,752 --> 00:51:01,912
DefiniteIy watch TV,

836
00:51:01,986 --> 00:51:04,318
but you have to be
in bed at 1 1 :00. Lights out.

837
00:51:04,389 --> 00:51:05,378
Forget it.

838
00:51:06,023 --> 00:51:07,354
19 minutes to 1 1 :00.

839
00:51:21,606 --> 00:51:22,937
This is a good one--

840
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,838
''We don't go out
when it rains.''

841
00:51:24,909 --> 00:51:26,399
I hope you appreciate this

842
00:51:26,477 --> 00:51:29,310
because my business is
going down the fucking toiIet.

843
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,711
I shouId be in L.A.

844
00:51:30,782 --> 00:51:33,148
Instead, I'm in
the Honeymoon Haven MoteI

845
00:51:33,217 --> 00:51:34,707
in BumbIefuck, Missouri,

846
00:51:34,786 --> 00:51:37,277
because you won't
go out when it rains.

847
00:51:37,355 --> 00:51:40,347
It's mystifying.
Fucking mystifying.

848
00:51:44,128 --> 00:51:46,824
What is this?
Good news, bad news?

849
00:51:46,898 --> 00:51:49,332
We passed DOT, but faiIed EPA.

850
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,960
It aII ends up the same.
I can't get my money.

851
00:51:52,036 --> 00:51:54,971
Yes, I'm just stuck
in Cincinnati since the funeraI.

852
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:56,700
So many Ieftover detaiIs.

853
00:51:56,774 --> 00:51:59,038
My famiIy is,
needIess to say,

854
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:00,577

Thank you.
I appreciate it.

856
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,679
WeII, it is a shock,
to say the Ieast.

857
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:09,117
Thank you. Is there any way
I can get an extension on that Ioan?

858
00:52:09,187 --> 00:52:12,350
Just a coupIe of days.
It wouId make a worId of difference.

859
00:52:19,897 --> 00:52:21,922
We don't go out
when it's raining.

860
00:52:26,938 --> 00:52:28,269
What? Speak up.

861
00:52:28,339 --> 00:52:30,830
I bought time,
I didn't buy that kind of time.

862
00:52:30,908 --> 00:52:32,603
You're gonna have to--
how much?

863
00:52:32,677 --> 00:52:35,168
'Course, it's 1 2:30.
Lunch is 1 2:30.

864
00:52:35,246 --> 00:52:38,044

865
00:52:38,115 --> 00:52:41,016
- Fish sticks?

866
00:52:41,085 --> 00:52:42,916
Want another appIe juice?

867

Orange soda.
Oh, it's 1 2:31 .

868
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,951
I gotta go.
He's starting to rock and moan.

869
00:52:48,025 --> 00:52:50,220
Yeah, it's definiteIy 1 2:32.

870
00:52:59,904 --> 00:53:03,931
'Course, there's four fish sticks.
There's supposed to be eight.

871
00:53:04,008 --> 00:53:06,238
Eight? There's Eight.

872
00:53:06,711 --> 00:53:07,871
Take a shower, Ray?

873
00:53:09,714 --> 00:53:11,045
You take a shower, right?

874
00:53:12,183 --> 00:53:14,845
Same thing as rain--
you get a IittIe wet.

875
00:53:14,919 --> 00:53:16,409
What do you say?

876
00:53:17,555 --> 00:53:19,546
'Course, the shower's
in the bathroom.

877
00:53:20,558 --> 00:53:22,458
That's the end
of that conversation.

Stu, IegaIIy, Bruner never estabIished
a conservatorship of Raymond?

887
00:53:47,618 --> 00:53:50,610
He didn't figure anyone wouId
show up to contest his authority.

888
00:53:50,688 --> 00:53:53,851
If that's the case,
I definiteIy wiII get custody

00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:03,095
Stu, I want a firm date,

00:54:45,476 --> 00:54:46,465
When did you drive?

902
00:54:46,544 --> 00:54:49,877
I drove the Buick on the driveway
when my dad came to WaIIbrook.

903
00:54:51,782 --> 00:54:54,114
Was dad in the car, Ray?

904

- And he Iet you drive the Buick?
- Yeah, sIow on the driveway.

905

I'm not wearing my underwear.

911
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,370
I gave you a fresh pair

912
00:55:18,442 --> 00:55:19,602
Not my underwear.

913
00:55:20,711 --> 00:55:23,043
I toId you to go in
the bathroom and put them on.

914
00:55:23,114 --> 00:55:25,446
'Course, they're in
the pocket of my jacket.

915
00:55:25,516 --> 00:55:26,710

916
00:55:26,784 --> 00:55:29,776
- These are too tight.
- I don't want them back.

917
00:55:29,854 --> 00:55:32,550
These are not boxer shorts.
Mine are boxer shorts.

When we pass a store,

921
00:55:41,132 --> 00:55:43,896
I get my boxer shorts

00:55:43,968 --> 00:55:46,232

924
00:55:47,638 --> 00:55:50,869
You don't have to go to
Cincinnati to pick up boxer shorts.

925
00:55:50,941 --> 00:55:53,671
It's Oak and Burnett,
in Cincinnati. It's Kmart.

926
00:55:53,744 --> 00:55:55,939
What did I say?
I know you hear me.

927
00:55:56,013 --> 00:55:58,641
You don't fooI me
with this shit for a second.

928
00:55:58,716 --> 00:55:59,808
Yours are too tight.

929
00:55:59,884 --> 00:56:02,148
Ray, did you fucking
hear what I said?

930
00:56:02,753 --> 00:56:03,913
Shut up!

931
00:56:07,258 --> 00:56:09,419
Cincinnati's a Iong way off.

932
00:56:09,493 --> 00:56:12,291
We're getting further
away from Kmart.

933
00:56:12,363 --> 00:56:14,831
You don't have to go to
Cincinnati to get underwear.

934
00:56:14,899 --> 00:56:17,094
You have to go to Kmart.
400 Oak Street.

- That is finaI!
- I'm gonna be short-Iess.

938
00:56:31,348 --> 00:56:32,508
Fuck!

939
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:36,747
What difference does it make
where you buy underwear?

940
00:56:36,821 --> 00:56:40,313
What difference does it make?
Underwear is underwear!

941
00:56:40,391 --> 00:56:42,382
It is underwear
wherever you buy it!

942
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,291
In Cincinnati or wherever!

You know what I think, Ray?

945
00:56:47,965 --> 00:56:50,297
I think this autism

946
00:56:50,367 --> 00:56:53,564
'Cause you can't teII me

- You're driving me crazy.
- Mine are boxer shorts.

951
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:06,809
We're gonna make
a stop and find a psychiatrist.

952
00:57:06,884 --> 00:57:08,215
You're driving me crazy.

953
00:57:08,285 --> 00:57:10,583
Oak and Burnett--
that's where the shorts are.

954
00:57:10,654 --> 00:57:12,986
We have to buy them
at Kmart, Oak and Burnett.

955
00:57:13,057 --> 00:57:14,547

957

Let's go back
to Cincinnati. Kmart.

958
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,578
Good Iuck trying to find

Hey, buddy! Hey, you!

962

Come on.

968
00:59:28,055 --> 00:59:31,047
- It's aII right.
- We gotta get to Kmart.

969
00:59:32,727 --> 00:59:34,786
- Come on.
- Kmart. 400 Oak Street.

970
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:37,023
- It said ''Don't waIk.''
- It's broken.

971
00:59:37,098 --> 00:59:38,429
It said ''Don't waIk.''

972
00:59:40,468 --> 00:59:44,131
Have to get to Kmart.
400 Oak and Burnett.

973
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,536
Oak and Burnett.

974
00:59:48,409 --> 00:59:50,604
He said, ''Young man,
go west. Go west.''

975
00:59:50,678 --> 00:59:53,010
And this is the way
our country deveIoped,

976
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,049
from the East Coast
to the West Coast.

977
00:59:56,117 --> 01:00:02,613
During that period of time,
there was initiated a...

978
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:05,284
what was known
as a Pony Express.

979
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:09,261
I'm sure you've read about it
in the history of the United States.

980
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:12,094
I may not have the days
exactIy right, or the years,

981
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:16,967
but I'm more or Iess famiIiar with
the history of the United States.

982
01:00:17,038 --> 01:00:18,300
And I Iove to teII...

983
01:00:18,372 --> 01:00:19,930
He's artistic?

984
01:00:20,007 --> 01:00:21,531
No. He's autistic.

985
01:00:21,609 --> 01:00:24,339
I'm not famiIiar with that.

986
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,744
What is the exact nature
of the probIem?

987
01:00:27,782 --> 01:00:30,148
He Iives in a worId of his own.

988
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:34,050
I'm sorry,
but what's <i>wrorg</i> with him?

989
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:39,290
Do a IittIe of
''What's on First?'' for her.

990
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,351
Who's on first.
What's on second.

991
01:00:43,864 --> 01:00:47,823
They set up a...initiaI program

992
01:00:47,902 --> 01:00:53,704
where a Pony Express wouId ride
for approximateIy 20 miIes...

993
01:00:55,977 --> 01:00:59,140
What am I supposed to do?
There's gotta be something I can do.

994
01:00:59,914 --> 01:01:01,245
I'm not a psychiatrist,

995
01:01:01,315 --> 01:01:04,409
but I do know that his brain
doesn't work Iike other peopIe.

996
01:01:04,485 --> 01:01:06,510
What he does isn't intended
to be annoying.

997
01:01:06,587 --> 01:01:09,420
If he's getting on your nerves,
just take a break.

998
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:12,482
- Spend time away from him.
- Sure, I'II just send him back.

999
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,393
- Sorry?
- Nothing, it's an inside joke.

1000
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:18,125
You're teIIing me I just
have to deaI with this?

1001
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:19,996
I just gotta deaI with this stuff?

1002
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:21,728
Yeah, that's about it.

1003
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:25,862
Out of curiosity, does he
have any speciaI abiIities?

1004
01:01:27,908 --> 01:01:29,876
WeII, he's got
a pretty good memory.

1005
01:01:29,944 --> 01:01:31,434
He counts toothpicks.

1006
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,277
They spiIIed toothpicks on the fIoor.

1007
01:01:34,348 --> 01:01:36,839
He took one Iook and knew
exactIy how many there were.

1008
01:01:36,917 --> 01:01:38,578
He counted them in seconds.

1009
01:01:42,023 --> 01:01:43,513
Are you good with numbers?

1010
01:01:45,693 --> 01:01:47,991
I read about this.
I want to try something.

1011
01:01:48,062 --> 01:01:51,327
- Kmart. 400 Oak Street.
- What did I teII ya? After this.

1012
01:01:51,399 --> 01:01:52,889
Ray, can we try something?

1013
01:01:53,901 --> 01:01:59,669
Do you know
how much 31 2 times 1 23 is?

1014
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,937
38,376.

1015
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:04,409
- He's right.
- What?

1016
01:02:04,478 --> 01:02:05,536
He's right.

1017
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:14,182
How much is
4,343 times 1 ,234?

1018
01:02:14,255 --> 01:02:16,246
5,359,262.

1019
01:02:16,324 --> 01:02:17,951
- He's a genius.
- He's right.

1020
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:20,182
He's a genius.

1021
01:02:20,261 --> 01:02:24,994
Ray, do you know how much
the square root of 2,1 30 is?

1022
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:29,998
46.1 5192304.

1023
01:02:30,237 --> 01:02:33,104
- 2304.
- That's amazing.

1024
01:02:33,174 --> 01:02:36,507
That is amazing. He shouId work
for NASA or something Iike that.

1025
01:02:38,446 --> 01:02:42,177
If you had a doIIar,
and you spent 50 cents,

1026
01:02:42,249 --> 01:02:44,080
how much money
wouId you have Ieft?

1027
01:02:48,122 --> 01:02:49,419
About 70.

1028
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:51,151
- 70 cents?
- 70 cents.

1029
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:54,626
- So much for the NASA idea.
- We shouId go to Kmart.

1030
01:02:54,695 --> 01:02:57,789
- What did I teII ya? After this.
- 400 Oak Street.

1031
01:02:57,865 --> 01:02:59,992
Do you know how much
a candy bar costs?

1032
01:03:00,868 --> 01:03:03,268
- About $100.
- $100, huh?

1033
01:03:03,337 --> 01:03:05,931
Know how much those
new compact cars cost?

1034
01:03:06,006 --> 01:03:07,337
About $100.

1035
01:03:08,843 --> 01:03:12,779
In his particuIar case,
he's very high-functioning.

1036
01:03:12,847 --> 01:03:15,907
Most autistics can't speak
or can't communicate.

1037
01:03:19,186 --> 01:03:20,983
Do you know what autistic is?

1038
01:03:21,455 --> 01:03:22,615
You know that word?

1039
01:03:25,159 --> 01:03:26,649
Are you autistic?

1040
01:03:28,629 --> 01:03:30,119
I don't think so.

1041
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,760
No, definiteIy not.

1042
01:03:39,807 --> 01:03:42,037
Lenny, shut up.
Let me see if I understand.

1043
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:43,098
Very smaII here.

1044
01:03:43,177 --> 01:03:45,839
It's gonna cost me
$10,000 additionaI for each car?

1045
01:03:45,913 --> 01:03:49,906
- It's very crowded.
- Ray, pIease. Just one second.

1046
01:03:50,651 --> 01:03:53,245
They want to take out
the manifoId and carburetors

1047
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,811
in order to put in
a fueI injection system? Now?

1048
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:57,824
That is nonsense.
This is buIIshit.

1049
01:03:57,892 --> 01:04:00,383
- What are you doing?
- Too crowded for a backpack.

1050
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:01,723
Leave this on.

1051
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:04,959
It's gonna cost me $40,000
just to meet EPA now.

1052
01:04:05,032 --> 01:04:06,294
What? No.

1053
01:04:06,367 --> 01:04:09,768
Give me the number, and I'm gonna
caII the conversion shop myseIf.

1054
01:04:09,837 --> 01:04:12,237
That's my pen,
and that's definiteIy my book.

1055
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:14,365
Taking your book
is not serious injury.

1056
01:04:14,442 --> 01:04:16,842
Serious Injury book is red.
That book is bIue.

1057
01:04:16,911 --> 01:04:19,072
Forgive me, I Iost
my secret decoder ring.

1058
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:22,673
- You're aIready on number 1 8.
- 1988. I know.

1059
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:24,911
'Course, that's my book.
That's my pen.

1060
01:04:24,985 --> 01:04:28,477
It's 1 2 minutes tiII Wapner.
It's definiteIy very smaII in here.

1061
01:04:28,556 --> 01:04:30,751
SmaII and safe.

1062
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:33,225
- You don't want to miss the party.
- ''What you're witnessing is reaI.''

1063
01:04:33,294 --> 01:04:35,353
There's a party
in your honor, Ray.

1064
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:38,461
When we get to L.A.,
a IittIe custody hearing.

1065
01:04:38,532 --> 01:04:42,195
You know why there's a party for you?
Because you're the $3 MiIIion Man.

1066
01:04:42,269 --> 01:04:46,205
- ''What you are witnessing is reaI.''
- Ken AIdorf. CharIie Babbitt.

1067
01:04:46,273 --> 01:04:48,935
- Fart.
- Yeah, I'II hoId.

1068
01:04:49,009 --> 01:04:50,340
Fart.

1069
01:04:50,411 --> 01:04:51,878
Did you fart, Ray?

1070
01:04:51,946 --> 01:04:53,538
Did you fucking fart?

1071
01:04:53,614 --> 01:04:56,105
Man...how do you get this--

1072
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,543
- How can you stand that?
- I don't mind it.

1073
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:00,780
How can you stand it?

1074
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:04,116
- 10 minutes to Wapner now.
- Ken, how are you?

1075
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:07,183
DefiniteIy Iocked

1076
01:05:07,261 --> 01:05:09,957
It's definiteIy gonna start.
<i>The People's Court.</i>

1077
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:12,362
How couId this be?
How couId this happen now?

1078
01:05:12,433 --> 01:05:16,233
<i>People's Court</i> starts on the--
they start right on the button.

1079
01:05:16,303 --> 01:05:18,294
They definiteIy start on the button.

1080
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:20,897
I got a probIem.
I'II caII you from our next stop.

1081
01:05:20,975 --> 01:05:23,967
We're definiteIy not gonna
make it for the program.

1082
01:05:24,044 --> 01:05:27,207
- We definiteIy have to go.
- We're going. Just take it easy.

1083
01:05:27,281 --> 01:05:28,714
Eight minutes to Wapner.

1084
01:05:28,782 --> 01:05:31,216
Where am I going to find
a teIevision around here?

1085
01:05:31,285 --> 01:05:34,049
- Eight minutes to Wapner.
- Eight minutes to Wapner?

1086
01:05:51,071 --> 01:05:52,561
Come on. Come on.

You wanna get in there

1088
01:05:57,444 --> 01:05:59,435
Want to see the show?
Then Iisten up.

1089
01:05:59,513 --> 01:06:02,505
Not another farmhouse in sight.
This is it, man.

1090
01:06:05,352 --> 01:06:06,979
You act weird, we don't get in.

1091

You Iistening to me?
I want you to Iook normaI.

1092
01:06:09,957 --> 01:06:11,891
As normaI as possibIe, aII right?

1093
01:06:11,959 --> 01:06:14,427
Just put your hands down.
Don't rock and moan.

1094
01:06:14,495 --> 01:06:16,986
- Four minutes to Wapner.
- Shut up and stand there.

1095
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:21,765
Don't rock and moan.
Put your hands down.

1096
01:06:25,105 --> 01:06:26,094
Good afternoon, ma'am.

1097

1099
01:06:32,313 --> 01:06:33,473
That's exactIy it.

1100
01:06:33,547 --> 01:06:36,107
You've been seIected
as a preIiminary candidate

1101
01:06:36,183 --> 01:06:38,674
to become our next
NieIsen famiIy in the area.

1102
01:06:38,752 --> 01:06:39,912
My husband's not home.

1103
01:06:39,987 --> 01:06:43,889
You'II share responsibiIity
for shaping teIevision programming

1104
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,550
viewed by our entire nation,

1105

in return for which
you'II receive a check

1106
01:06:48,162 --> 01:06:50,392
in the amount
of $286 each month.

1107
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:52,621
Who's he?

1108
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:56,534
That wouId be my partner,
Mr. Bainbridge, who does the--

1109

- Oh, boy!
- That's it! You bIew it.

1111
01:07:02,409 --> 01:07:04,240
You don't get

1112
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:06,438
- It's finished!
- One minute to Wapner.

1113
01:07:06,513 --> 01:07:08,504
One minute to Wapner.

I had you in there!
You were in there!

I'm sorry, ma'am. I Iied to you.

1120
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:26,231
That man is my brother.

1121
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,427
If he doesn't get to
watch <i>People's Court</i>.

1122
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:30,436
he's gonna throw a fit
right on your porch.

1123
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:33,405
You can heIp, or you can
stand there and watch it happen.

1139
01:09:08,001 --> 01:09:09,161
Thank you.

1140
01:09:48,942 --> 01:09:52,673
'Course, I'm never going back.
It's definiteIy going to be a Iong journey.

1141
01:09:52,746 --> 01:09:54,475
Just a coupIe of more days.

1142
01:09:54,548 --> 01:09:59,110
Then who's pIaying first? You mean
the feIIa pIaying for St. Louis?

1143
01:09:59,186 --> 01:10:03,452
It's just another moteI.
You gotta do this every time?

1144
01:10:03,524 --> 01:10:05,458
That's the man's name.
Whose name?

1145
01:10:05,526 --> 01:10:08,188
Why are you asking me?
I'm not asking you. I'm teIIing you.

1146
01:10:08,262 --> 01:10:11,254
Who's on first.
I'm asking <i>you</i> who's on first.

1147
01:10:11,331 --> 01:10:12,696
Yo, Ray.

1148
01:10:12,766 --> 01:10:15,200
Ray, this is not...it's not a riddIe.

1149
01:10:15,269 --> 01:10:17,931
You know the feIIa's name?
Then who's pIaying first?

1150
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,269
You're never gonna figure out
who's on first base,

1151
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,171
because Who <i>is</i> on first base.

1152
01:10:22,242 --> 01:10:23,869
That's the joke. It's comedy.

1153
01:10:23,944 --> 01:10:26,469
Sometimes his wife comes
and coIIects it. Whose wife?

1154
01:10:26,547 --> 01:10:28,412
- It's comedy.
- Every doIIar of it.

1155
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:31,416
You got a first baseman on first?

1156
01:10:31,485 --> 01:10:33,146
It's a routine between
Abbott and CosteIIo.

1157
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:34,812
When you do it, you're not funny.

1158
01:10:34,888 --> 01:10:37,982
You're the comedy team
of Abbott and Abbott. Understand?

1159
01:10:38,058 --> 01:10:40,151
Sometimes his wife
comes down and coIIects it.

1160
01:10:40,227 --> 01:10:41,660
Whose wife? Yeah.

1161
01:10:41,728 --> 01:10:45,027
Ray, you are never
going to soIve it.

1162
01:10:45,666 --> 01:10:48,294
You know why?
'Cause it's not a riddIe.

1163
01:10:49,136 --> 01:10:52,435
If you understood that,
if you understood that it's funny,

1164
01:10:52,506 --> 01:10:53,837
you might get better.

1165
01:10:53,907 --> 01:10:56,603
AII I'm trying to find out is,
what's the guy's name on first base?

1166
01:10:56,677 --> 01:10:58,611
What's the guy's
name on first base?

1167
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:00,647
No. What's the guy's name
on second base.

1168
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:03,945
Have you got a first baseman?
Then who's pIaying first? Yeah.

1169
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:08,187
Who's...you know
the feIIow's name?

1170
01:11:08,255 --> 01:11:11,486
Then who's pIaying first?
The feIIa pIaying for St. Louis?

1171
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:13,788
Who. The guy on first--
the first baseman.

1172
01:11:13,861 --> 01:11:16,193
Who's on first.
What are you asking me for?

1173
01:11:16,263 --> 01:11:18,663
Have you got
a first baseman on first? Yeah.

1174
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:20,063
AII right, Ray. Come on.

1175
01:11:20,133 --> 01:11:23,000
We're gonna put the bed
by the window the way you Iike.

1176
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,332
We got your appIe juice.

1177
01:11:24,404 --> 01:11:27,669
We're gonna take the pens and paper,
put 'em on the tabIe...

1178
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:30,870
- Did I forget something?
- Cheese baIIs.

1179
01:11:30,944 --> 01:11:34,311
- Yes, I forgot the cheese baIIs.
- DefiniteIy have cheese baIIs.

1180
01:11:34,381 --> 01:11:37,282
- But we got them.
- I have to have 1 2 cheese baIIs.

1181
01:11:37,351 --> 01:11:39,615
I have to get
my tartar controI toothpaste.

1182
01:11:39,686 --> 01:11:40,914
I got that a coupIe of days ago.

1183
01:11:40,988 --> 01:11:42,580
Where's my
tartar controI toothpaste?

1184
01:11:48,061 --> 01:11:51,053
Remember when that doctor
asked you those questions today?

1185
01:11:52,299 --> 01:11:55,029
- How did you do that?
- I see it.

1186
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:56,433
I see it.

1187
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:58,935
What's that?
Stop that for a second.

1188
01:11:59,006 --> 01:12:00,166
I see it.

1189
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:03,232
Just put that down.
I'm trying to taIk to you.

1190
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:05,369
When I say stop,
why don't you stop?

1191
01:12:05,445 --> 01:12:07,504
Why do you aIways
have to act Iike an idiot?

1192
01:12:09,917 --> 01:12:13,045
- You think that's funny?
- Funny Rain Man. Funny teeth.

1193
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,451
What did you say?

1194
01:12:14,521 --> 01:12:16,182
- Funny teeth.
- Rinse.

1195
01:12:21,895 --> 01:12:25,387
Why did you say funny teeth?

1196
01:12:25,465 --> 01:12:27,456
You said funny teeth,
funny Rain Man.

1197
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:30,660
Rain Man?
I said Rain Man?

1198
01:12:30,737 --> 01:12:32,068
Yeah, funny Rain Man.

1199
01:12:35,876 --> 01:12:38,504
Was I trying to say Raymond,
and it came out Rain Man?

1200
01:12:38,578 --> 01:12:40,409
Yeah, funny Rain Man.

1201
01:12:42,182 --> 01:12:44,446
You? You're the Rain Man?

1202
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:00,997
Who took this picture?

1203
01:13:01,068 --> 01:13:02,228
D-A-D.

1206
01:13:08,976 --> 01:13:11,410

1208
01:13:15,382 --> 01:13:17,213

01:13:17,284 --> 01:13:19,980
7.2 inches of snow that day.

1210
01:13:21,755 --> 01:13:26,624
- Just after mom died--New Year's.
- Mom died January 5, 1965.

1211
01:13:26,693 --> 01:13:28,786
And you remember

1212
01:13:28,862 --> 01:13:32,195
- After short and sudden iIIness.
- You remember that day you Ieft?

1213
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,434
Was I there? Where was I?

1214
01:13:35,502 --> 01:13:38,528
You were in the window.
You waved to me.

1215
01:13:38,605 --> 01:13:41,472
Bye-bye, Rain Man.
Bye-bye, Rain Man.

1216
01:13:43,777 --> 01:13:47,110
So you were the one
that sang to me?

1217
01:13:49,816 --> 01:13:52,683
What--what did you sing?

1218
01:13:52,753 --> 01:13:54,243
What was that song?

1219
01:13:55,822 --> 01:13:56,982
What did you sing?

1220
01:13:59,092 --> 01:14:02,619
WeII, she was just 1 7

1221
01:14:02,696 --> 01:14:05,824
And you know what I mean

1222
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:10,836
And the way she Iooked
was way beyond compare

1223
01:14:11,838 --> 01:14:17,105
So how couId I dance
with another

1224
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:23,808
When I saw her standing there?

1225
01:14:28,922 --> 01:14:30,549
Did I Iike it when you sang to me?

1226
01:14:33,026 --> 01:14:36,723
Did we sing any
other songs Iike the BeatIes?

1227
01:14:40,867 --> 01:14:43,199
Scary! Scary bad!

1228
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,567
Scary bad!

1229
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:47,103
It's scary!

1230
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:53,038

01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:05,422
Hot water burn baby.

1236
01:15:05,492 --> 01:15:08,427

- I'm not burned, man.
- Tub burn baby.

1240
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:16,962
I'm not burned.

1241
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:21,630
I'm not burned. It's okay.

1242
01:15:25,879 --> 01:15:27,039
It's okay.

1243
01:15:32,786 --> 01:15:35,050
Gotta go to WaIIbrook now.

1244
01:15:35,689 --> 01:15:37,281
That's why they put you away.

1245
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:39,781
They thought you'd hurt me.

1246
01:15:45,966 --> 01:15:47,558
Never hurt CharIie Babbitt.

1247
01:15:51,872 --> 01:15:53,203
What?

1248
01:15:54,207 --> 01:15:55,936
Never hurt CharIie Babbitt.

1249
01:15:56,643 --> 01:15:57,871
What, Ray?

1250
01:15:57,944 --> 01:16:00,174
Never hurt CharIie Babbitt.

1251
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:02,675
What?

1252
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:10,456
Come on, it's 1 1 :00, Ray.
Lights out.

1253
01:16:20,901 --> 01:16:22,562
Never hurt CharIie Babbitt.

01:16:22,636 --> 01:16:24,536
Never, never hurt CharIie Babbitt.

1255
01:16:31,778 --> 01:16:34,178
Right where you Iike it,
at the end of the bed.

1256
01:16:46,493 --> 01:16:47,653
Come on, Ray.

1257
01:17:35,508 --> 01:17:37,066
Hi, it's me.

<i>Dor't ask me toright. Charlie.</i>

<i>h dor't krow what to say.</i>
<i>Let it sit.</i>

01:17:54,995 --> 01:17:56,986
That's something

1265
01:17:57,764 --> 01:18:00,164
<i>There's lots of thirgs</i>

What are you Iooking at that for?

1269
01:19:36,396 --> 01:19:39,957
I spent a coupIe of hundred on a TV,
and now you're watching a dryer.

1270
01:19:40,033 --> 01:19:41,330
I don't know.

1271
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:43,995
At the shrink hearing,
we're gonna have to prove

1272
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,834
you prefer to watch this IittIe TV,
as opposed to the cIothes dryer.

1273
01:19:46,906 --> 01:19:49,397
You understand that?
You Iistening to me?

1274
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:53,071
Turn this off when
you're not watching it.

1275
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:57,481
You run down the batteries, where
you gonna be when Wapner's on?

1276
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:59,950
Yeah, the red one
aIways faIIs the same.

1277
01:20:00,019 --> 01:20:03,785
Why aren't you Iistening to me?
You just don't want to Iisten to me.

1278
01:20:03,857 --> 01:20:06,189
You want to go back
to WaIIbrook, is that it?

1279
01:20:07,293 --> 01:20:09,056
I gotta make a phone caII.

1280
01:20:19,806 --> 01:20:20,966

<i>Where have you beer ? h've beer</i>

01:20:26,346 --> 01:20:30,510
<i>Clothes? We are ir serious trouble.</i>
<i>What are you doirg buyirg clothes?</i>

1284
01:20:30,583 --> 01:20:31,743
Just take it easy.

<i>They repossessed</i>
<i>the cars to pay off the loar.</i>

This is important.

One if it's bad, two if it's good.

That's right.
Two if it's good, Ray.

Now, Iisten,
casinos have house ruIes.

1356
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:35,805
The first one is,
they don't Iike to Iose.

1357
01:26:37,216 --> 01:26:40,185
So you never, never show
that you are counting cards.

1358
01:26:40,253 --> 01:26:42,517
That is the cardinaI sin, Ray.

1359
01:26:42,588 --> 01:26:44,988
Are you Iistening?
That's very important.

1360
01:26:45,057 --> 01:26:48,049
Yeah. Counting...counting is bad.

1361
01:26:48,127 --> 01:26:49,822

I don't see him using a computer.

01:32:16,689 --> 01:32:18,680
He's not,
but something's not right.

1399
01:32:18,757 --> 01:32:21,282
No one in the worId

1414
01:33:42,841 --> 01:33:44,274
It's not your game, Ray.

1415
01:33:44,343 --> 01:33:45,935
I just Iost $3,000.

1416
01:33:46,645 --> 01:33:48,169
That's $3,000 I Iost.

$3,500.
Six months to pay.

1429
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:24,374
We don't have to pay
for the room--that's comped.

1430
01:34:25,351 --> 01:34:27,842
I'm free and cIear. I'm gonna go

01:34:30,923 --> 01:34:34,222
Don't go anywhere. UntiI I get back,

1432
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:36,284
- Don't waIk.

Yeah, get to know each other.

That's aII right, sugar,

01:35:23,309 --> 01:35:24,708
Yeah, we're just taIking.

01:35:30,849 --> 01:35:33,511
- What room? I'II bring him up.
- That's aII right.

1448
01:35:35,054 --> 01:35:37,614
You want to stay here
and get to know each other?

1449
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:40,420
Yeah. Get to know
each other. Just taIking.

1450
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:43,995
This wiII be interesting.
I'II be over here just in case.

1451
01:35:46,098 --> 01:35:47,759
He doesn't seem to Iike me.
Who is he?

1452
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:49,630
My brother.
I'm Iiving in his room.

1453
01:35:49,702 --> 01:35:51,294
He seems young
to be your brother.

1454
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:54,498
He was born August 1 2, 1962.

1455
01:35:54,573 --> 01:35:55,972
It was a Sunday.

1456
01:35:57,843 --> 01:35:59,834
What exactIy

1457
01:36:00,746 --> 01:36:04,113
- We're counting cards.
- You're counting cards?

1458
01:36:04,183 --> 01:36:05,673
We're counting cards.

1459
01:36:07,386 --> 01:36:09,877
- We're counting cards.

1460
01:36:11,156 --> 01:36:12,487
We're counting cards.

1461
01:36:12,558 --> 01:36:14,890
I know you're counting cards.
What eIse do you do?

1462
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,224
Are you taking
any prescription medication?

1463
01:36:18,364 --> 01:36:20,127
Look, I'm out of here.

1464
01:36:21,367 --> 01:36:22,959
'Course, what time is the date?

1465
01:36:23,035 --> 01:36:24,696

1468
01:36:31,577 --> 01:36:36,014
10:00? You Iike her?
You think she's pretty?

1469
01:36:36,081 --> 01:36:37,844
Yeah. She's very sparkIy.

1470
01:36:37,916 --> 01:36:39,406
DefiniteIy very sparkIy.

1471
01:36:39,485 --> 01:36:40,850
Very sparkIy.

1472
01:36:43,922 --> 01:36:47,323
He did a great job on that suit.
You don't reaIize how good you Iook.

1473
01:36:47,393 --> 01:36:49,293
- Do you Iike it?
- It's not Kmart.

1474
01:36:50,229 --> 01:36:53,096
How couId you not Iike that suit?
You Iook fantastic, Ray.

1475
01:36:53,165 --> 01:36:55,565
- How can you not Iike it?
- It's not a Kmart suit.

1476
01:36:55,634 --> 01:36:59,661
I'm gonna Iet you in on a IittIe secret.
Kmart sucks. Okay?

1477
01:37:03,242 --> 01:37:04,402
Here you go.

1478
01:37:05,177 --> 01:37:06,735
It's the high roIIers' suite.

1479
01:37:07,479 --> 01:37:08,639
This is for you.

1480
01:37:09,415 --> 01:37:11,246
Ever seen a room Iike this before?

1481
01:37:11,917 --> 01:37:14,511
What's up there?
What's up there?

1482
01:37:14,586 --> 01:37:15,917
You're not even Iooking.

1483
01:37:15,988 --> 01:37:18,582
- Yeah. Bed.
- That's your bed.

1484
01:37:18,657 --> 01:37:21,490
I had them put it by the window,
just the way you Iike it.

1485
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:23,425
- Bed by the window.
- Right. Go on up.

1486
01:37:24,596 --> 01:37:26,257
Just the way you Iike it, isn't it?

1487
01:37:28,867 --> 01:37:31,199
Look at you with aII those Iights.

1488
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:33,898
Mr. Vegas. You are
Mr. Las Vegas now, man.

1489
01:37:34,706 --> 01:37:35,900
What do you think?

1490
01:37:35,974 --> 01:37:39,239
There's a Iot of Iights.
Very sparkIy. Very twinkIy.

1491
01:37:39,912 --> 01:37:42,881
We made a Iot of money today.
We made a Iot of money!

1492
01:37:43,515 --> 01:37:47,747
Forgetting the $3,000 we tossed away
at that wheeI of fortune.

1493
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:49,788
Yeah, wheeI of fortune.

1494
01:37:49,855 --> 01:37:53,188
I'm sorry about that.
I got a IittIe carried away.

1495
01:37:53,258 --> 01:37:55,920
I got a IittIe hot, okay?

1496
01:37:57,930 --> 01:38:00,797
I'm saying I'm sorry.
I just want you to know, I am sorry.

1497
01:38:03,135 --> 01:38:04,466
I'm apoIogizing.

1498
01:38:05,804 --> 01:38:09,968
I got a IittIe carried away.
The money...I got a IittIe greedy.

1499
01:38:10,642 --> 01:38:11,802
Want to say something?

1500
01:38:11,877 --> 01:38:14,471
I have to be at
the bar at 10:00 with Iris.

1501
01:38:14,546 --> 01:38:16,377
'Cause I've got
to thank you, man.

1502
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,608
You...

1503
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:21,684
You did it. You did it.
I was just there.

1504
01:38:22,588 --> 01:38:23,919
You saved my ass.

1505
01:38:23,989 --> 01:38:26,753
I was just aIong for the ride.

1506
01:38:26,825 --> 01:38:30,818
Have to be at the bar at 10:00.
Have to go to the date with Iris.

1507
01:38:30,896 --> 01:38:32,420
Yeah, Iris--that's her name.

1508
01:38:32,498 --> 01:38:34,159
Big date.
Going to go dancing.

1509
01:38:34,233 --> 01:38:35,632
Dancing.

1510
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:37,862
Have to go to
the date with Iris, dancing.

1511
01:38:37,936 --> 01:38:40,131
- Know how to dance?
- I don't know.

1512
01:38:40,205 --> 01:38:42,765
You don't know how?
You ought to Iearn sometime.

1513
01:38:42,841 --> 01:38:45,332
Have to Iearn
to dance with a date.

1514
01:38:45,511 --> 01:38:48,002
Have to Iearn
to dance with a date.

1515
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:51,072
I was just kidding. You're not gonna
have to dance on this date.

1516
01:38:51,149 --> 01:38:53,140
Have to go to the date.
Learn to dance.

1517
01:38:53,218 --> 01:38:54,845
DefiniteIy. Now.

1518
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:58,378
You don't have to dance now,
but I'II teach you sometime.

1519
01:38:58,457 --> 01:38:59,685
DefiniteIy have to.

1520
01:38:59,758 --> 01:39:01,248
You're not gonna have to dance.

1521
01:39:01,326 --> 01:39:03,419
DefiniteIy have to Iearn
to dance for the date.

1522
01:39:03,495 --> 01:39:06,794
Sorry I even brought this up.
AII right, Ray. My mistake.

1523
01:39:06,865 --> 01:39:07,854
10:00.

1524
01:39:07,933 --> 01:39:10,800
You got the onIy famous
dancing hooker in Vegas.

1525
01:39:10,869 --> 01:39:12,200
Stand over there.

1526
01:39:20,612 --> 01:39:21,601
Come over here.

1527
01:39:23,982 --> 01:39:25,472
Now, you hear the music?

1528
01:39:25,551 --> 01:39:27,109
Just watch my feet.

1529
01:39:27,185 --> 01:39:28,675
Raymond, watch my feet.

1530
01:39:30,088 --> 01:39:31,419
Just do what I'm doing.

1531
01:39:33,392 --> 01:39:36,486
FeeI the rhythm of the music?
We're just moving our feet Iike that.

1532
01:39:38,297 --> 01:39:40,629
Now, you're the guy,
so you're gonna have to Iead.

1533
01:39:40,699 --> 01:39:42,690
And I'm the date,
so you want to...

1534
01:39:45,003 --> 01:39:46,163
You want to...

1535
01:39:46,705 --> 01:39:48,536
Put your Ieft hand up Iike this.

1536
01:39:48,607 --> 01:39:51,041
Don't stop moving.
You paying attention?

1537
01:39:51,109 --> 01:39:53,839
Don't stop moving.
Put your Ieft hand up Iike this.

1538
01:39:53,912 --> 01:39:55,846
Left hand up. That's good.

1539
01:39:55,914 --> 01:39:57,643
Don't stop.
Just keep moving.

1540
01:39:58,317 --> 01:39:59,477
Good. Just Iike that.

1541
01:39:59,551 --> 01:40:02,019
Take this other hand,
put it around behind my back.

1542
01:40:03,088 --> 01:40:04,680
Want to Iearn how to dance?

1543
01:40:04,756 --> 01:40:06,849
You gotta touch someone
when you dance.

1544
01:40:06,925 --> 01:40:08,916
I'm not going to hurt you,
aII right?

1545
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:11,285
Just put it right there.

1546
01:40:11,363 --> 01:40:13,354
I take my hand
and put it up here.

1547
01:40:14,366 --> 01:40:16,425
Watch my feet, Ray.
Watch my feet.

1548
01:40:16,535 --> 01:40:17,866
The rhythm, the rhythm.

1549
01:40:18,904 --> 01:40:19,893
AII right?

1550
01:40:20,606 --> 01:40:24,235
You can't watch my feet the whoIe time,
so you're gonna have to Iook up.

1551
01:40:24,876 --> 01:40:29,210
When I teII you to,
just Iook up, reaI sIow.

1552
01:40:29,281 --> 01:40:30,441
Just keep moving.

1553
01:40:31,283 --> 01:40:34,184
Okay, you ready?
Start Iooking up.

1554
01:40:35,454 --> 01:40:36,944
A IittIe more. Keep moving.

1555
01:40:37,956 --> 01:40:39,116
Just a IittIe more.

1556
01:40:40,592 --> 01:40:41,752
A IittIe more.

1557
01:40:42,761 --> 01:40:43,921
AII the way up.

1558
01:40:46,898 --> 01:40:49,731
There you go, Ray.
You're dancing. This is it.

1559
01:40:49,801 --> 01:40:50,961
Yeah, dancing.

1560
01:40:51,503 --> 01:40:53,164
You want to cIose your hand here.

1561
01:40:54,172 --> 01:40:55,662
You wanna puII Iike that.

1562
01:40:55,741 --> 01:40:57,732
You're gonna
turn me Iike this, okay?

1563
01:40:59,011 --> 01:41:00,740
Just turn. That's good.

1564
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:03,839
- This is dancing.
- This is dancing.

1565
01:41:03,915 --> 01:41:06,577
Don't know about you,
but I'm feeIing a IittIe siIIy.

1566
01:41:40,652 --> 01:41:41,812
That's it.

1567
01:41:42,387 --> 01:41:44,912
AII right! AII right!

1568
01:41:44,990 --> 01:41:46,787
BeautifuI!
You are a good dancer!

1569
01:41:46,858 --> 01:41:48,189
You wanna give me a hug?

1570
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:03,801
I just wanted
to give you a hug, Ray.

1571
01:42:06,712 --> 01:42:08,543
Just feIt Iike giving you a hug.

1572
01:42:24,863 --> 01:42:26,160
What are you doing here?

1573
01:42:26,698 --> 01:42:28,859
- I'm unempIoyed.
- What do you mean?

1574
01:42:28,934 --> 01:42:30,663
You don't know
about the business?

1575
01:42:30,736 --> 01:42:33,330
I know about the business.
Come on in. It's okay.

1576
01:42:35,774 --> 01:42:37,935
I'm, uh, gIad to see you.

1577
01:42:38,944 --> 01:42:40,536
Ray, Iook who's here.

1578
01:43:05,270 --> 01:43:07,966
It's not right,
what you're doing to Raymond.

1579
01:43:08,607 --> 01:43:09,835
He's fine.

1580
01:43:09,908 --> 01:43:11,068
I know he's fine--

1581
01:43:11,143 --> 01:43:14,738
he's in Las Vegas
in a suit, in a big room.

1582
01:43:14,813 --> 01:43:15,973
It makes me sad.

1583
01:43:16,782 --> 01:43:18,181
Six minutes to my date.

1584
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:19,649
Six minutes to Iris.

1585
01:43:20,986 --> 01:43:22,476
He has a date?

1586
01:43:24,022 --> 01:43:27,981
Raymond, it'd be nice if you didn't
carry that teIevision everywhere.

1587
01:43:28,059 --> 01:43:30,550
What do you gotta bring
a Watchman for on your date?

1588
01:43:30,629 --> 01:43:31,960
The man's dancing.

1589
01:43:32,697 --> 01:43:34,756
But what does
your date Iook Iike?

1590
01:43:36,067 --> 01:43:38,934
She's very sparkIy.
She Iooks Iike a hoIiday.

1591
01:43:41,006 --> 01:43:43,031
I don't think
I've heard that one before.

1592
01:43:44,142 --> 01:43:45,973
Mr. KeIso wouId Iike to see you.

1593
01:43:46,044 --> 01:43:47,477
I don't know Mr. KeIso.

1594
01:43:47,546 --> 01:43:50,709
He's director of security.
WouId you come with me, pIease?

1595
01:43:50,782 --> 01:43:53,250
Sure. Susanna,
why don't you stay with Raymond?

1596
01:43:53,318 --> 01:43:54,580
Right this way, sir.

1597
01:44:10,936 --> 01:44:12,631
10:01 . She's not here.

1598
01:44:12,704 --> 01:44:14,695
She'II come. She wiII.

1599
01:44:24,583 --> 01:44:26,244
CongratuIations, Mr. Babbitt.

1600
01:44:26,318 --> 01:44:28,650
Counting into a six-deck shoe
is quite a feat.

1601
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:31,621
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you're taIking about.

1602
01:44:31,690 --> 01:44:35,421
We make videotapes, Mr. Babbitt,
and we anaIyze the tapes,

1603
01:44:35,493 --> 01:44:38,189
and we even share some of
the information with the other casinos.

1604
01:44:38,263 --> 01:44:41,926
These tapes suggest that you shouId
take your winnings and Ieave the state.

1605
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,264
Someone has
a good day at the tabIes

1606
01:44:44,336 --> 01:44:46,804
and you accuse them
of iIIegaI activities?

1607
01:44:46,872 --> 01:44:48,863
Is this how you treat aII your guests?

1608
01:44:49,407 --> 01:44:51,705
AII you have to do is
cIose your mouth and go home.

1609
01:44:51,776 --> 01:44:55,041
Those are the best odds
you're gonna see for a whiIe.

1610
01:44:55,113 --> 01:44:56,546
I'd take 'em.

1611
01:45:05,557 --> 01:45:07,320
Did you want
to dance on your date?

1612
01:45:08,693 --> 01:45:10,354
There'II be other chances.

1613
01:45:10,428 --> 01:45:12,919
Many pretty girIs
wouId Iove to dance with you.

1614
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:14,925
It's gonna be okay.

1615
01:45:33,151 --> 01:45:35,881
- I Iike this music, Ray.
- EIevator stopped.

1616
01:45:35,954 --> 01:45:37,114
It's okay.

1617
01:45:37,188 --> 01:45:40,521
Think you couId show me the way
you were going to dance with Iris?

1618
01:45:40,992 --> 01:45:42,152
Yes?

1619
01:45:42,227 --> 01:45:44,058
WouId you Iike to dance with me?

1620
01:45:44,129 --> 01:45:47,030
- EIevator's on hoId.
- It's okay. Give me this.

1621
01:45:51,736 --> 01:45:53,135
Show me. Show me how.

1622
01:45:53,204 --> 01:45:55,035
Yeah. CharIie Babbitt taught me.

1623
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:00,471
Dancing in the eIevator.

1624
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:03,040
It's nice.

1625
01:46:06,418 --> 01:46:07,749
You're very good.

1626
01:46:21,299 --> 01:46:23,460
Iris missed a beautifuI dance.

1627
01:46:26,171 --> 01:46:28,002
- And a kiss.
- Yeah, and a kiss.

1628
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:31,300
- Have you ever kissed a girI?
- I don't know.

1629
01:46:33,211 --> 01:46:34,371
You don't know?

1630
01:46:36,948 --> 01:46:38,939
Open your mouth. Open.

1631
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:42,279
Like this.

1632
01:46:42,354 --> 01:46:46,381
Like you are tasting
something very good...

1633
01:46:46,458 --> 01:46:47,857
and very soft.

1634
01:46:51,863 --> 01:46:53,194
Like this.

1635
01:46:53,264 --> 01:46:54,424
CIose your eyes.

1636
01:47:01,639 --> 01:47:02,799
It's okay, Ray.

1637
01:47:12,650 --> 01:47:13,810
How was that?

1638
01:47:13,885 --> 01:47:15,045
Wet.

1639
01:47:16,888 --> 01:47:18,048
Then we did it right.

1640
01:47:18,123 --> 01:47:19,920
EIevator's definiteIy stuck.

1641
01:47:19,991 --> 01:47:21,618
No, it's not stuck.

1642
01:47:25,830 --> 01:47:26,990
Here.

1643
01:47:29,701 --> 01:47:31,532
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

1644
01:47:33,338 --> 01:47:34,999
- Like us.
- Yeah, Iike us.

1645
01:47:36,374 --> 01:47:37,432
What did I teII you?

1646
01:47:37,509 --> 01:47:39,670
I promised you
you couId drive, this is it.

1647
01:47:39,744 --> 01:47:42,076
At WaIIbrook,
I drive sIow on the driveway.

1648
01:47:42,147 --> 01:47:45,014
- This is okay? He can drive?
- I'm an exceIIent driver.

1649
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:46,914
He's very good in the driveway.

1650
01:48:44,876 --> 01:48:46,366
Ray, get in the front seat.

1651
01:48:48,613 --> 01:48:51,275
I'II wait to hear from you
after Raymond's meeting?

1652
01:48:52,016 --> 01:48:53,745
Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

1653
01:48:53,985 --> 01:48:56,317
- I'm nervous.
- I know.

1654
01:48:56,387 --> 01:49:00,323
Listen, I'm gIad--
happy that you came to Vegas.

1655
01:49:00,391 --> 01:49:01,551
I know.

1656
01:49:03,661 --> 01:49:04,650
Ciao.

1657
01:49:06,865 --> 01:49:09,857
Ray, thank you for
the date in the eIevator.

1658
01:49:09,934 --> 01:49:11,094
It was reaIIy nice.

1659
01:49:11,736 --> 01:49:12,725
Ciao.

1660
01:49:12,804 --> 01:49:16,035
- Thank you for the what?
- Nothing. Something between us.

1661
01:49:16,107 --> 01:49:17,267
Between us?

1662
01:49:17,342 --> 01:49:18,502
Us.

1663
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:23,240
Us, Ray?

1664
01:49:29,654 --> 01:49:32,054
Here we go, Ray.
This is your bedroom up here.

1665
01:49:32,123 --> 01:49:35,149
'Course, there's no bed there.
DefiniteIy no bed there.

1666
01:49:35,226 --> 01:49:37,387
This is a magic bed, Ray.

1667
01:49:37,896 --> 01:49:39,158
Just watch and see.

1668
01:49:39,230 --> 01:49:42,631
We got the tabIe over here.
We got the teIevision.

1669
01:49:43,268 --> 01:49:46,260
Went to the video store,
I got a IittIe surprise for you.

1670
01:49:46,337 --> 01:49:47,861
I picked up a video for you.

1671
01:49:49,007 --> 01:49:51,669
- Don't start.
- I'm not asking, I'm teIIing you.

1672
01:49:51,743 --> 01:49:55,406
It's not just another pIace.
This is...this is my pIace.

1673
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:58,677
That's the man's name.
That's whose name? Yes.

1674
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:01,048
Who? The first baseman.
Who's on first.

1675
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:04,418
You got a first baseman?
Who's pIaying first? AbsoIuteIy.

1676
01:50:04,489 --> 01:50:06,980
<i>Wher you pay the first basemar</i>.

<i>Every dollar of it. Why rot?</i>

01:50:13,064 --> 01:50:14,759
- <i>So who gets it?</i>
- <i>Why shouldr't he?</i>

1680
01:50:14,832 --> 01:50:17,027
<i>Sometimes his wife</i>
<i>comes ard collects it.</i>

1681
01:50:17,101 --> 01:50:18,261
- <i>Whose wife?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

<i>- h'm rot chargirg robody.</i>

1688
01:50:35,153 --> 01:50:37,178

1689
01:50:37,255 --> 01:50:40,554
<i>- h'm rot askirg who's or secord.</i>

<i>- We're rot talkirg about him.</i>

<i>h'm at the Boraverture.</i>
<i>How about toright at 8.:30?</i>

1700
01:51:31,542 --> 01:51:33,271
Tomorrow you'II meet Dr. Marston

1701
01:51:33,344 --> 01:51:36,108
who's in charge of Raymond's
psychiatric evaIuation.

1702
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:39,274
I gave him boxes
of fiIes on Raymond. Boxes.

1703
01:51:39,350 --> 01:51:40,510
WeII, good Iuck.

1704
01:51:40,585 --> 01:51:43,110
This isn't a cIose caII, son.
It's a formaIity.

1705
01:51:43,187 --> 01:51:45,451
Your brother's
a very disabIed individuaI.

1706
01:51:45,523 --> 01:51:47,923
You teIIing me
Marston wiII ruIe against me?

1707
01:51:47,992 --> 01:51:51,018
No, I'm teIIing you
it's aIways been a Iost cause.

1708
01:51:51,095 --> 01:51:53,256
Then what is this about?
Why'd you caII me?

1709
01:51:53,331 --> 01:51:56,391
Your father put me
in charge of aII the money.

1710
01:51:56,467 --> 01:51:59,561
It doesn't matter whether
or not you win custody of Raymond.

1711
01:51:59,637 --> 01:52:01,195
I won't have to pay you a dime.

1712
01:52:01,272 --> 01:52:03,206
It's at my discretion,
not the court's.

1713
01:52:03,274 --> 01:52:04,832
What, so you can't Iose?

1714
01:52:04,909 --> 01:52:07,241
I can Iose.
I can Iose Raymond.

1715
01:52:07,312 --> 01:52:10,304
I care about your brother's Iife
and the treatment he receives.

1716
01:52:10,381 --> 01:52:12,872
I made a commitment
to your father 20 years ago,

1717
01:52:12,950 --> 01:52:15,111
and I'm not wiIIing
to gambIe with that.

1718
01:52:16,821 --> 01:52:17,981
What is this?

1719
01:52:18,056 --> 01:52:19,751
It's a very big check.

1720
01:52:23,194 --> 01:52:24,957
$250,000.

1721
01:52:25,029 --> 01:52:28,430
And no strings attached.
You just waIk away, CharIie.

1722
01:52:29,801 --> 01:52:31,462
This isn't about you and me.

1723
01:52:32,203 --> 01:52:33,864
It's not about winning or Iosing.

1724
01:52:36,541 --> 01:52:37,701
I asked you a week ago,

1725
01:52:37,775 --> 01:52:40,266
why didn't anyone ever
teII me I had a brother.

1726
01:52:40,345 --> 01:52:41,835
You didn't have an answer.

1727
01:52:43,548 --> 01:52:44,708
I don't know.

1728
01:52:46,918 --> 01:52:48,408
It's funny, I just reaIized

1729
01:52:48,486 --> 01:52:51,478
I'm not pissed off anymore
my father cut me out of his wiII.

1730
01:52:53,091 --> 01:52:55,184
You were his friend,
you probabIy knew he tried

1731
01:52:55,259 --> 01:52:57,193
to contact me a few times
over the years.

1732
01:52:57,261 --> 01:52:59,388
I never caIIed him back.
I was a prick.

1733
01:52:59,464 --> 01:53:01,625
If he was my son,
didn't return my caIIs,

1734
01:53:01,699 --> 01:53:03,599
I'd have written him out. Fuck him.

1735
01:53:03,668 --> 01:53:05,499
But it's not
about the money anymore.

1736
01:53:07,672 --> 01:53:10,470
It's about--
I just don't understand.

1737
01:53:10,541 --> 01:53:12,475
Why didn't he teII me
I had a brother?

1738
01:53:12,543 --> 01:53:14,477
Why didn't you teII me
I had a brother?

1739
01:53:14,545 --> 01:53:17,378
Why didn't anyone ever
teII me that I had a brother?

1740
01:53:18,783 --> 01:53:19,943
I mean...

1741
01:53:20,985 --> 01:53:24,944
It'd have been nice to know him
for more than just the past...six days.

1742
01:55:11,028 --> 01:55:12,017
Come on.

1743
01:55:12,630 --> 01:55:15,121
It stopped. It's aII right.

1744
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:23,500
V-E-R-N.

1745
01:55:24,408 --> 01:55:26,808
Vern. Vern.

1746
01:55:26,878 --> 01:55:28,971
Main man.
My main man, Vern.

1747
01:55:30,414 --> 01:55:31,574
V-E-R-N.

1748
01:55:38,990 --> 01:55:40,480
My main man, Vern.

1749
01:55:43,828 --> 01:55:45,159
V-E-R-N.

1750
01:55:47,494 --> 01:55:49,553
They got raspberry,
strawberry, bIueberry,

1751
01:55:49,629 --> 01:55:51,790
Pink Caddie, whoIe-wheat,
Peachy Keen, beer nut,

1752
01:55:51,865 --> 01:55:54,356
Rocky Road, buckwheat,
BeIIy Buster, bIueberry.

1753
01:55:54,434 --> 01:55:56,095
What kind of pancakes you want?

1754
01:55:56,169 --> 01:55:58,103
- Pancakes.
- What kind?

1755
01:55:58,171 --> 01:56:00,036
- Pancakes.
- Of course.

1756
01:56:00,107 --> 01:56:03,008
MapIe syrup supposed to be
on the tabIe before the pancakes.

1757
01:56:07,981 --> 01:56:09,505
CharIie Babbitt made a joke.

1758
01:56:09,583 --> 01:56:10,982
I made a joke, Ray.

1759
01:56:31,671 --> 01:56:33,332
Step back a IittIe bit, Ray.

1760
01:56:53,827 --> 01:56:54,987
HeIIo?

1761
01:56:56,730 --> 01:56:58,561
Why don't you go
sit down over there?

1762
01:57:02,836 --> 01:57:03,996
HeIIo?

1763
01:57:04,538 --> 01:57:06,165
This is not a IegaI proceeding,

1764
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:08,332
so there's no Iawyers,
no judge present,

1765
01:57:08,408 --> 01:57:10,308
just the peopIe
who care about Raymond.

1766
01:57:11,044 --> 01:57:13,205
Raymond, why don't you
have a seat over there.

1767
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:15,043
Mr. Babbitt, why don't you go
to that side of the tabIe.

1768
01:57:15,115 --> 01:57:16,844
Raymond, right here.
Have a seat.

1769
01:57:16,917 --> 01:57:19,215
Raymond, right here.
Take this seat.

1770
01:57:19,286 --> 01:57:21,254
Ray, put your
knapsack on the fIoor.

1771
01:57:21,321 --> 01:57:24,552
This is a good opportunity
to be honest with one another--

1772
01:57:24,624 --> 01:57:27,115
Ray, the TV.
On the fIoor.

1773
01:57:27,194 --> 01:57:28,354
I'm sorry.

1774
01:57:28,862 --> 01:57:32,298
I don't know any easy way
to say this, Mr. Babbitt--

1775
01:57:32,365 --> 01:57:34,299
Say what?
Have I Iost aIready?

1776
01:57:34,367 --> 01:57:36,528
No, you haven't.
I'm not the judge and jury.

1777
01:57:36,603 --> 01:57:39,094
I'm a doctor making
a recommendation to a court.

1778
01:57:39,172 --> 01:57:42,608
I must teII you that Dr. Bruner
is a very respected professionaI.

1779
01:57:42,676 --> 01:57:45,372
Raymond's case has been
meticuIousIy documented,

1780
01:57:45,445 --> 01:57:48,881
and WaIIbrook is one of the
finest institutions in this country.

1781
01:57:48,949 --> 01:57:51,440
You've made up your mind.
I'II see you in court.

1782
01:57:51,518 --> 01:57:52,678
No one's your enemy.

1783
01:57:52,752 --> 01:57:54,913
My brother came further
with me in a week

1784
01:57:54,988 --> 01:57:56,979
than he did with you in 20 years.

1785
01:57:57,057 --> 01:57:59,821
I don't think it's necessary
to chaIIenge Dr. Bruner.

1786
01:57:59,893 --> 01:58:01,224
I'm sorry.

1787
01:58:01,294 --> 01:58:03,592
ExactIy what happened
this past week, Raymond?

1788
01:58:03,663 --> 01:58:06,063
- WeII, we got--
- I was asking Raymond.

1789
01:58:06,133 --> 01:58:08,465
Raymond, what happened
this past week?

1790
01:58:09,636 --> 01:58:11,467
- What did you do?
- Counted cards.

1791
01:58:11,538 --> 01:58:13,369
Counted cards in Las Vegas.

1792
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:17,501
- Your brother took you to Las Vegas?
- $3,000 on the wheeI of fortune.

1793
01:58:17,577 --> 01:58:19,772
He gave you $3,000
to gambIe with?

1794
01:58:19,846 --> 01:58:22,974
Lost $3,000 on pitifuI 20.

1795
01:58:23,049 --> 01:58:25,210
- What eIse did you do?
- Bet on number 20.

1796
01:58:25,285 --> 01:58:28,118
- What eIse did you do?
- Danced with CharIie Babbitt.

1797
01:58:28,188 --> 01:58:30,588
- Danced with your brother?
- He wanted to Iearn--

1798
01:58:30,657 --> 01:58:32,318
Danced with Susanna.

1799
01:58:32,392 --> 01:58:34,360
- Kissed Susanna.
- Kissed Susanna?

1800
01:58:34,427 --> 01:58:35,758
Yeah. In the eIevator.

1801
01:58:35,829 --> 01:58:37,660
Did you enjoy kissing a woman?

1802
01:58:37,731 --> 01:58:38,891
I don't know.

1803
01:58:38,965 --> 01:58:40,125
How did it feeI?

1804
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:41,360
It feIt wet.

1805
01:58:41,434 --> 01:58:42,594
Wet?

1806
01:58:42,669 --> 01:58:44,000
Quite a trip.

1807
01:58:45,906 --> 01:58:48,739
- You enjoy being on the road?
- I'm an exceIIent driver.

1808
01:58:48,808 --> 01:58:49,968
You drove?

1809
01:58:51,011 --> 01:58:53,241
Your brother Iet you
drive on the highway?

1810
01:58:53,313 --> 01:58:56,009
- SIow on the driveway.
- He didn't drive on the highway.

1811
01:58:58,218 --> 01:59:01,119
- Did he have any emotionaI outbursts?
- What do you mean?

1812
01:59:01,188 --> 01:59:02,746
Things they tend to do.

1813
01:59:02,822 --> 01:59:04,983
InfIicting bodiIy harm
on themseIves...

1814
01:59:05,058 --> 01:59:07,720
- Okay, a coupIe of times.
- A coupIe of times?

1815
01:59:07,794 --> 01:59:09,762
Okay, he had what you caII
an outburst at the airport

1816
01:59:09,829 --> 01:59:12,320
because he didn't want to fIy,
so we didn't fIy.

1817
01:59:12,399 --> 01:59:14,162
When was
the Iast outburst he had?

1818
01:59:14,234 --> 01:59:16,600
- This morning.
- This morning?

1819
01:59:16,670 --> 01:59:17,728
This is buIIshit.

1820
01:59:17,804 --> 01:59:20,432
I couId teII you anything,
I couId teII you nothing,

1821
01:59:20,507 --> 01:59:21,667
and you'd never know.

1822
01:59:21,741 --> 01:59:23,606
The smoke aIarm went off.

1823
01:59:23,677 --> 01:59:25,736
He got a IittIe nervous,
but he's fine.

1824
01:59:25,812 --> 01:59:28,042
Don't feeI as though
I'm pIacing any bIame.

1825
01:59:28,114 --> 01:59:30,776
We went out for pancakes.
Look at him--he's fine.

1826
01:59:30,850 --> 01:59:32,545
You don't have to be defensive.

1827
01:59:32,619 --> 01:59:34,849
- I'm being honest.
- You're missing the point.

1828
01:59:34,921 --> 01:59:37,253
You're missing the point.
I'm being truthfuI.

1829
01:59:37,324 --> 01:59:39,622
The point is,
I'm not pIacing any bIame--

1830
01:59:39,693 --> 01:59:42,856
I had a father I hardIy knew,
a mother I didn't know at aII,

1831
01:59:42,929 --> 01:59:46,092
I find out I have a brother,
and I'm supposed to give him up?

1832
01:59:46,166 --> 01:59:47,497
No one is saying anything.

1833
01:59:47,567 --> 01:59:49,626
I didn't hurt him,
he's not hurting me,

1834
01:59:49,703 --> 01:59:53,139
we're not hurting you, so why
are you interfering with my famiIy?

1835
01:59:53,206 --> 01:59:56,300
- Do you understand?
- I understand that.

1836
01:59:56,376 --> 01:59:57,536
You do have a brother,

1837
01:59:57,611 --> 02:00:00,171
but he's not capabIe
of having a reIationship with you.

1838
02:00:00,247 --> 02:00:01,407
That's your opinion.

1839
02:00:01,481 --> 02:00:04,814
Did you spend 24 hours a day,
seven days a week with him?

1840
02:00:04,884 --> 02:00:08,285
You cannot take on this responsibiIity
without professionaI guidance.

1841
02:00:08,355 --> 02:00:10,755
- That's your opinion.
- Yes, it's my opinion.

1842
02:00:10,824 --> 02:00:12,883
There's a coupIe of things
I'd Iike to go over.

1843
02:00:12,959 --> 02:00:16,292
Dr. Bruner states that you
stoIe Raymond out of the institution

1844
02:00:16,363 --> 02:00:19,628
and you're wiIIing to trade him
for $1 .5 miIIion. Is that correct?

1845
02:00:19,699 --> 02:00:23,191
My father died. I was upset.
Okay? That was wrong.

1846
02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:25,795
So Iast week you were upset,
and this week you suddenIy

1847
02:00:25,872 --> 02:00:27,134
found some devotion to your brother

1848
02:00:27,207 --> 02:00:31,337
and you want to take care
of him the rest of your Iife?

1849
02:00:31,411 --> 02:00:33,743
So in the beginning,
it was Iike a kidnapping.

1850
02:00:34,714 --> 02:00:37,581
Kidnapping--that's very strong.
I didn't kidnap my brother.

1851
02:00:37,651 --> 02:00:39,346
But in the course of the week,

1852
02:00:39,419 --> 02:00:41,649
you came to have
an understanding with him.

1853
02:00:41,721 --> 02:00:42,710
Yes.

1854
02:00:42,789 --> 02:00:45,019
- That...
- Yes?

1855
02:00:45,091 --> 02:00:48,026
I understand that this
sounds irrationaI to you.

1856
02:00:48,094 --> 02:00:50,153
Yes, when it started out, it had--

1857
02:00:50,230 --> 02:00:52,391
Don't feeI compeIIed
to be defensive.

1858
02:00:52,465 --> 02:00:53,955
- Can I taIk?
- Yes, you can.

1859
02:00:54,034 --> 02:00:56,002
I'd Iike to taIk. Thank you.

1860
02:00:56,069 --> 02:00:57,400
There's no accusations.

1861
02:00:57,470 --> 02:00:58,630
Go ahead.

1862
02:00:58,705 --> 02:01:00,434
There's no accusations?

1863
02:01:02,175 --> 02:01:05,736
You have to understand that
when we started out together,

1864
02:01:05,812 --> 02:01:08,542
that he was onIy my brother...

1865
02:01:08,615 --> 02:01:09,775
in name.

1866
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:15,280
And then...

1867
02:01:18,958 --> 02:01:21,051
Then this morning we had pancakes.

1868
02:01:21,127 --> 02:01:23,118
MapIe syrup.
MapIe syrup on the--

1869
02:01:23,630 --> 02:01:25,291
MapIe syrup on the tabIe.

1870
02:01:25,365 --> 02:01:27,663
And CharIie Babbitt made a joke.

1871
02:01:29,703 --> 02:01:30,863
You see, we--

1872
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:34,264
I made a connection.

1873
02:01:34,341 --> 02:01:36,002
I think that's very admirabIe,

1874
02:01:36,076 --> 02:01:38,670
but the purpose of
this meeting is to determine

1875
02:01:38,745 --> 02:01:40,076
what is best for Raymond.

1876
02:01:40,146 --> 02:01:43,172
Whether or not he's capabIe
of functioning in the community,

1877
02:01:43,249 --> 02:01:46,741
and what, in fact, he wants--
if that's possibIe to determine.

1878
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:47,912
I'm aII for that.

1879
02:01:47,987 --> 02:01:50,251
Raymond's unabIe
to make those kind of decisions.

1880
02:01:50,357 --> 02:01:51,415
You're wrong.

1881
02:01:51,491 --> 02:01:53,288
He can't decide for himseIf.

1882
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:55,658
He's capabIe of
a Iot more than you know.

1883
02:01:55,729 --> 02:01:58,289
Why don't we ask Raymond.
Maybe we can find a few answers.

1884
02:01:58,365 --> 02:02:01,266
Raymond, can I ask
you a few questions?

1885
02:02:02,068 --> 02:02:03,558
The doctor's taIking to you.

1886
02:02:03,636 --> 02:02:05,126
Can I ask you a few questions?

1887
02:02:08,308 --> 02:02:09,935
Do you want to stay with CharIie?

1888
02:02:11,611 --> 02:02:14,705
WouId you Iike to stay with
your brother in Los AngeIes?

1889
02:02:14,781 --> 02:02:17,443
Ray, the doctor's
asking you a question,

1890
02:02:17,517 --> 02:02:18,950
so you Iisten, okay, Ray?

1891
02:02:19,719 --> 02:02:22,187
Do you want to stay
with your brother CharIie?

1892
02:02:23,656 --> 02:02:25,920
Do you want to stay
with your brother CharIie?

1893
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:30,327
You do? You want
to stay with your brother?

1894
02:02:31,564 --> 02:02:33,794
Stay with my brother,
CharIie Babbitt.

1895
02:02:33,867 --> 02:02:34,925
That's what you want?

1896
02:02:37,570 --> 02:02:39,231
You want to stay
with your brother?

1897
02:02:43,309 --> 02:02:44,867
Can I ask you something eIse?

1898
02:02:46,146 --> 02:02:47,670
Do you want to go
back to WaIIbrook?

1899
02:02:49,516 --> 02:02:52,781
Can you make a distinction between
your brother and WaIIbrook?

1900
02:02:55,855 --> 02:03:00,189
Do you want to stay with your
brother CharIie here in Los AngeIes?

1901
02:03:00,660 --> 02:03:02,560
Or go back to WaIIbrook?

1902
02:03:03,596 --> 02:03:06,724
Two separate things--stay with
your brother, or go back to WaIIbrook.

1903
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:08,597
It's not one thing.

1904
02:03:08,668 --> 02:03:10,329
This is your brother.
Make a choice.

1905
02:03:10,403 --> 02:03:12,166
Back to WaIIbrook,
stay with CharIie.

1906
02:03:14,707 --> 02:03:16,197
Can you make that choice?

1907
02:03:16,276 --> 02:03:17,265
One or the other.

1908
02:03:17,343 --> 02:03:20,176
- AII right.
- Stay back at WaIIbrook.

1909
02:03:20,246 --> 02:03:22,441
HoId on. Just hoId on!

1910
02:03:22,515 --> 02:03:24,107
Stay back at WaIIbrook.

1911
02:03:24,184 --> 02:03:26,652
AII right.
You made your point.

1912
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:28,914
Okay? You don't have
to humiIiate him.

1913
02:03:28,988 --> 02:03:32,446
Ray, it's okay. It's over.

1914
02:03:33,693 --> 02:03:35,888
Stay back at WaIIbrook
with CharIie Babbitt.

1915
02:03:36,896 --> 02:03:39,126
- Stay back at WaIIbrook.
- It's over.

1916
02:03:44,971 --> 02:03:46,962
Dr. Bruner,
can I taIk to you a minute?

1917
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:48,200
Excuse me.

1918
02:03:56,649 --> 02:03:57,809
You okay, Ray?

1919
02:04:00,820 --> 02:04:02,879
You don't want
any more questions, do you?

1920
02:04:06,893 --> 02:04:08,224
I don't know.

1921
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,161
You don't want
any more questions, do you?

1922
02:04:16,236 --> 02:04:17,396
No more questions.

1923
02:04:21,508 --> 02:04:24,068
Don't worry. There's not gonna be
any more questions, okay?

1924
02:04:24,143 --> 02:04:26,441
No more questions.
I'II make sure of that.

1925
02:04:26,513 --> 02:04:27,673
Yeah. Main man.

1926
02:04:29,315 --> 02:04:30,805
- What?
- My main man.

1927
02:04:35,955 --> 02:04:37,115
Listen...

1928
02:04:41,027 --> 02:04:43,689
I don't know if I'm gonna have
a chance to taIk to you again.

1929
02:04:47,767 --> 02:04:49,098
Because you see, these...

1930
02:04:50,503 --> 02:04:51,993
Dr. Bruner reaIIy Iikes you,

1931
02:04:52,071 --> 02:04:55,165
and he's probabIy gonna want
to take you back with him.

1932
02:04:55,241 --> 02:04:56,401
You know?

1933
02:04:59,178 --> 02:05:00,509
But I want you to know

1934
02:05:00,580 --> 02:05:03,572
that what I said about being
