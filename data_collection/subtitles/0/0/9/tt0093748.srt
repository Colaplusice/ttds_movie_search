{1803}{1833}Uh...
{1835}{1882}I got to go.
{1883}{1921}I got to go.
{1962}{2010}I got to catch|a plane.
{3035}{3090}Two hours of staring|at material
{3091}{3157}to decide to reconvene|after the holidays.
{3159}{3220}They're selling cosmetics,|not curing cancer.
{3222}{3294}Why aren't you going|to the airport?
{3295}{3381}Why bust my ass?|Take the 8:00 flight with me.
{3382}{3453}I told Susan|I'd be home by 9:00.
{3454}{3484}That's you.
{3522}{3592}I left my gloves|in Brian's office.
{3594}{3664}I don't need them|to fly home.
{3665}{3746}Would you pick them up?|I'll get them tomorrow.
{3747}{3784}Have a good holiday.
{3786}{3820}See you in Chicago.
{3822}{3867}You'll never|make the 6:00.
{5262}{5295}Ha ha!
{5509}{5534}Taxi!
{5536}{5572}Oof!
{6222}{6254}Cab! Cab!
{6398}{6440}Sir?
{6442}{6480}Sir? Sir?
{6482}{6517}Excuse me.
{6518}{6589}Could I appeal|to your good nature
{6590}{6647}and ask you|for your cab?
{6649}{6720}I don't have a good nature.|Excuse me.
{6722}{6752}Come on!
{6754}{6817}Could I offer you $10?
{6818}{6863}20. I'll give you $20.
{6865}{6905}I'll take 50.
{6934}{6959}All right.
{6961}{7032}Anyone who would|pay $50 for a cab
{7034}{7083}would certainly pay $75.
{7085}{7134}Not necessarily.
{7160}{7205}All right, 75.
{7207}{7237}You're a thief.
{7239}{7281}Close. I'm an attorney.
{7341}{7381}Have a happy holiday.
{7382}{7414}This will help.
{7589}{7628}Hey! Hey!
{7630}{7655}Hey!
{7657}{7689}Hey, that's my cab!
{7690}{7725}That's my cab!
{7726}{7760}Pull over! Pull over!
{7761}{7795}All right. Pull over!
{7797}{7852}That's my cab!
{7854}{7888}Pull over, buddy!
{7890}{7948}You're messing|with the wrong guy!
{8095}{8157}This is my cab! Out!
{8638}{8665}Excuse me.
{8703}{8738}Excuse me.
{8739}{8765}Excuse me.
{8871}{8897}Excuse me.
{8967}{9058}Your attention please.|Your attention please.
{9060}{9103}Mid-Central flight 909
{9105}{9169}to Chicago O'hare|has been delayed.
{9171}{9228}All passengers wishing|Further information
{9230}{9277}please contact|the ticket agent.
{9279}{9322}When are Grandma and Grandpa
{9324}{9366}and Grandma|and Grandpa coming?
{9368}{9409}They'll be here|tomorrow, honey.
{9411}{9449}Mom?
{9451}{9529}You think Grandpa Walt|will give me a noogie?
{9531}{9587}Of course he'll|give you noogies.
{9589}{9633}It means he loves you.
{9634}{9675}Why don't I get noogies?
{9677}{9724}Because you get|Indian burns.
{9726}{9781}But I prefer noogies.
{9822}{9880}Keep an eye on your brother.
{9932}{9955}Hello.
{9957}{9991}Who is it?
{9993}{10027}Shh. Where are you?
{10029}{10065}Who is it?
{10067}{10107}Shh! It's Daddy.
{10109}{10134}Flight delay.
{10136}{10191}When will you be in?
{10193}{10233}No later than 10:00.
{10235}{10282}I'll wait up for you.
{11124}{11170}I know you, don't l?
{11172}{11218}I'm usually|good with names,
{11220}{11255}but I've forgotten yours.
{11257}{11311}You stole my cab.
{11340}{11410}I've never stolen|anything in my life.
{11412}{11482}I hailed a cab|on Park Avenue today.
{11484}{11553}before I could get in,|you stole it.
{11618}{11701}You're the guy|who tried to get my cab.
{11702}{11761}I knew I knew you. Yeah.
{11762}{11833}You scared the bejesus|out of me.
{11930}{12025}It was awful easy getting a cab|during rush hour.
{12026}{12064}Forget it.
{12066}{12114}I can't forget it.
{12116}{12150}I am sorry.
{12152}{12218}I had no idea|that was your cab.
{12220}{12289}Let me make it|up to you somehow.
{12290}{12361}How about a hot dog|and a beer?
{12362}{12399}Uh, no, thanks.
{12401}{12445}Just a hot dog, then.
{12446}{12505}I'm picky about what I eat.
{12506}{12532}Some coffee.
{12534}{12557}No.
{12559}{12581}Milk?
{12582}{12608}No.
{12610}{12669}Soda? Some tea?|Lifesavers? Slurpee?
{12670}{12706}Sir, please.
{12707}{12768}Just let me know. I'm here.
{12770}{12817}I knew I knew you.
{12859}{12940}You should have discussed this|with the ticket agent.
{12942}{13009}I didn't know|he put me in coach.
{13010}{13072}I'm sorry.|First class is full.
{13074}{13130}I have a first class ticket.
{13132}{13193}You have a coach|seat assignment.
{13194}{13226}Hi, Larry.
{13228}{13250}Hi, Liz.
{13312}{13346}Here OK?
{13348}{13394}Oh, here, there.|Anywhere's fine.
{13396}{13422}Pardon me.
{13516}{13588}You'll get a refund|on the difference.
{13590}{13658}I want a seat|in first class
{13660}{13732}where I was booked|over a month ago.
{13734}{13785}I've had|enough of you.
{13787}{13821}Now take your seat.
{13823}{13870}You've had enough of me?
{13871}{13940}First you delay me,|then you bump me.
{13942}{13977}What happens next?
{13979}{14045}Is this a coincidence or what?
{14046}{14084}Have a seat.
{14596}{14642}I never did|introduce myself.
{14644}{14678}Del Griffith.
{14680}{14714}American Light|and Fixture...
{14716}{14786}Director of sales,|shower curtain ring division.
{14818}{14882}I sell shower|curtain rings.
{14884}{14918}Best in the world.
{15004}{15050}And you are?
{15052}{15086}Uh, Neal Page.
{15088}{15173}Neal Page.|Pleased to meet you, Neal Page.
{15175}{15266}So what do you do|for a living, Neal Page?
{15268}{15294}Marketing.
{15296}{15322}Marketing? Super.
{15324}{15362}Super. Fabulous.
{15364}{15398}Isn't that nice?
{15400}{15458}I don't want|to be rude, but...
{15460}{15521}I'm not much|of a conversationalist.
{15523}{15578}I'd like to finish|this article.
{15580}{15626}A friend wrote it, so...
{15628}{15674}Don't let me stop you.
{15676}{15722}Last thing I want to be
{15724}{15758}is an annoying|blabbermouth.
{15816}{15850}Nothing grinds my gears
{15852}{15885}worse than|some chowder head
{15886}{15940}who can't keep|his trap shut.
{15942}{16009}Catch me running|Of fat the mouth,
{16010}{16044}give me a poke.
{16223}{16257}Ohh!
{16284}{16320}Ohh, that feels good.
{16322}{16369}Oh, God,|I'm telling you.
{16370}{16418}My dogs are barking today.
{16420}{16451}Whew!
{16506}{16553}Ohh!
{16618}{16653}That feels better.
{17282}{17339}Six bucks and my right nut
{17341}{17399}says we're not|landing in Chicago.
{17833}{17855}Hello.
{17857}{17879}Hi.
{17881}{17916}Where are you?
{17917}{17951}I'm in Wichita.
{17953}{17975}Wichita, Kansas?
{17977}{18034}Are you all right?|What happened?
{18035}{18093}We couldn't land|in Chicago.
{18095}{18165}I don't understand|what Wichita has to do
{18167}{18214}with a snowstorm|in Chicago?
{18215}{18262}What's going on, Neal?
{18264}{18321}We took off|from New York,
{18323}{18385}they closed Chicago,|we landed here.
{18431}{18466}Neal.
{18575}{18625}Trouble on the home front?
{18627}{18706}I really don't think that's|any of your concern.
{18708}{18776}The finest line|a man will walk
{18778}{18848}is between success at work|and success at home.
{18849}{18936}I got a motto...|Like your work, love your wife.
{18937}{18992}Well, I'll remember that.
{19018}{19060}What's the flight situation?
{19062}{19088}Simple.
{19089}{19160}No way we'll get out|of here tonight.
{19162}{19196}We'd have more luck
{19198}{19268}playing pickup sticks|with our butt cheeks.
{19269}{19316}We'll find out soon enough.
{19317}{19391}By the time the airline|cancels this flight,
{19393}{19427}which they will eventually,
{19429}{19517}you'd have a better chance finding|a three-legged ballerina
{19519}{19556}than a hotel room.
{19557}{19610}I could be stuck here?
{19612}{19667}I'm saying|you are stuck here.
{19725}{19764}Ladies and gentlemen,
{19766}{19824}may I have|your attention, please.
{19825}{19860}I'm sorry to announce
{19861}{19908}that we're canceling|flight 909
{19909}{19972}due to severe weather|in Chicago.
{19974}{20012}Hi, I was wondering
{20013}{20092}if you had any rooms|available for tonight?
{20094}{20127}Anything.|Anything will do.
{20129}{20156}I'm sorry.
{20158}{20190}Is there another motel...
{20360}{20382}Neal.
{20413}{20453}Hi.
{20455}{20490}Well?
{20516}{20572}Welcome to Wichita.
{20574}{20634}Did you book a room yet?
{20636}{20698}I, uh, couldn't|get in anywhere.
{20700}{20754}When we arrived,|you called home.
{20756}{20799}I called|the Braidwood Inn.
{20801}{20845}I missed that one.
{20846}{20882}I got an idea.
{20884}{20918}I know the manager.
{20920}{20991}If you pick up|the cab fare,
{20993}{21066}I'll make sure|you get a room.
{21068}{21102}Umm...
{21212}{21258}Yeah. Yeah, sure. Great.
{21260}{21287}All right.
{21289}{21355}Grab an end|of this thing, will you?
{21357}{21398}Thanks a lot.
{21450}{21497}Is this your trunk?
{21499}{21574}Yeah. You should try|lugging this thing
{21576}{21624}around New York City.
{21863}{21921}* Well,|it takes you up *
{21950}{22018}* And it|beats you down, yeah *
{22045}{22089}* It plays around *
{22118}{22184}* And it spends|your money... *
{22225}{22296}Where the hell|is the motel?
{22338}{22389}Doobie,|is it much farther?
{22390}{22421}Not much.
{22423}{22481}Why didn't you|take the interstate?
{22482}{22541}Your friend|has never been here,
{22542}{22612}so I figured he'd like|to look around.
{22613}{22661}There's nothing|on the interstate.
{22662}{22722}It's the middle|of the night.
{22724}{22793}I know, but he's|proud of his town.
{22794}{22853}That's a rare thing|these days.
{23189}{23259}Take care of the luggage,|will you, Doobie?
{23261}{23295}OK, Del.
{23342}{23391}Get off of me.
{23501}{23535}Stick with me.
{23838}{23879}Evening, Gus.
{23953}{24024}Del Griffith,|how the hell are you?
{24026}{24107}Still a million bucks shy|of being a millionaire.
{24137}{24215}Gus, meet an old friend.|Neal Page, Gus Mooney.
{24217}{24270}Glad to meet you, Nick.
{24272}{24365}I told my friend you'd|give him a room tonight.
{24366}{24442}Do you have|a major credit card?
{24473}{24540}Do you still honor those discount|credit cards?
{24542}{24609}I'll have to charge you|for a double,
{24610}{24681}but with the discount,|it'll come out even.
{24682}{24730}We're a pretty good team.
{24731}{24801}We were on our way|to Chicago,
{24802}{24870}and the storm|brought us here.
{24872}{24956}I know.|I must have half your flight here.
{24958}{25017}Well, I guess you're all fixed,
{25018}{25081}so, uh, there you are.
{25082}{25140}Last room in the complex.
{25141}{25177}You mean sh-share?
{25203}{25245}Hey, easy on that.
{25246}{25281}OK.
{25942}{26011}Hell of a cab ride,|wasn't it?
{26013}{26095}Yeah, you don't see|cabs like that too often.
{26292}{26335}Want to take a shower?
{26337}{26359}No!
{26361}{26431}I meant, did you want to go first?
{26433}{26467}You thought...
{26469}{26551}I wouldn't...|What do you think I am?
{26553}{26583}Gee, that's funny.
{27177}{27211}Ah. Ah.
{27213}{27285}Oh, come...|come on.
{27559}{27603}Ah! Ouch, ouch, ouch!
{27799}{27846}To wear a pompadour...
{29395}{29430}Excuse me.
{29563}{29609}I'd switch pillows with you,
{29611}{29658}but I'm allergic to sponge.
{29659}{29730}I'd be sneezing all night|with that thing.
{29731}{29801}That's why I carry|my own pillow.
{29803}{29837}It's hypoallergenic.
{29998}{30031}I had no idea
{30033}{30103}those beer cans|would blow like that.
{30105}{30175}You left them|on a vibrating bed.
{30177}{30235}What did you think|would happen?
{30237}{30293}It just didn't|occur to me.
{30295}{30341}It didn't|occur to you,
{30343}{30426}so I have to sleep|in a puddle of beer.
{30427}{30461}You want to switch?
{30463}{30501}I just want to sleep.
{30511}{30557}Me, too.|I am bushed.
{30559}{30593}Good night.
{30595}{30630}Good night.
{31343}{31398}I'll have to burn the sheets!
{31399}{31481}What if the shoe|was on the other foot?
{31483}{31525}I'd go barefoot!
{32158}{32212}Traffic is resuming|at O'Hare field,
{32213}{32256}and flights will be|moving shortly.
{32681}{32716}Sorry.
{33072}{33113}Goddamn!
{33115}{33147}What, what?
{33149}{33184}That's it!
{33185}{33254}Without clearing my sinuses,|I'll snore all night.
{33256}{33351}If your kid spills his milk,|do you slap him?
{33353}{33411}What-what-what is that|supposed to mean?
{33413}{33472}You're not a very|tolerant person.
{33474}{33532}You've bugged me|since New York,
{33534}{33578}starting with|stealing my cab.
{33580}{33619}God, you're a tight-ass.
{33621}{33688}How would you like|a mouthful of teeth?
{33690}{33726}Oh, and hostile, too.
{33728}{33762}Nice personality combination...
{33763}{33800}hostile and intolerant.
{33802}{33832}That's borderline criminal.
{33833}{33858}Screw you.
{33860}{33928}You spilled beer|all over the bed,
{33930}{33976}you mess up|the bathroom...
{33978}{34012}Who let you stay?
{34014}{34060}I even let you pay,
{34061}{34126}so you wouldn't feel|like an intruder.
{34128}{34150}An intruder?
{34152}{34213}Right. You ruined a nice trip.
{34214}{34285}Who talked my ear off|on the plane?
{34286}{34333}Who was that?|I'm curious.
{34334}{34420}Who told you to book a room?|I did.
{34422}{34456}You're an ungrateful jackass.
{34458}{34492}Sleep in the lobby.
{34494}{34556}I hope you wake up so stiff
{34558}{34593}you can't even move.
{34595}{34670}You got a free cab,|a free room,
{34672}{34718}and someone|who will listen
{34720}{34766}to your boring stories.
{34768}{34826}Didn't you notice on the plane
{34828}{34863}when you started talking,
{34865}{34923}I started reading|the vomit bag?
{34925}{34983}Didn't that|give you some clue
{34985}{35043}that this guy's|not enjoying it?
{35045}{35079}Everything's not an anecdote.
{35081}{35116}You have to discriminate.
{35118}{35178}You choose things|that are funny
{35179}{35216}or mildly amusing
{35218}{35252}or interesting.
{35254}{35280}You're a miracle.
{35282}{35344}Your stories|have none of that.
{35345}{35406}They're not even|amusing accidentally.
{35408}{35442}Honey, meet Del Griffith.
{35444}{35490}He's got some|amusing anecdotes.
{35492}{35601}Here's a gun so you can|blow your brains out.
{35602}{35649}You'll thank me for it.
{35651}{35741}I could tolerate|any insurance seminar.
{35742}{35848}For days,|I could listen to them go on and on.
{35850}{35924}They'd say,|"How can you stand it?"
{35926}{36017}And I'd say,|"Cause I've been with Del Griffith.
{36019}{36062}I can take anything".
{36064}{36110}You know what they'd say?
{36112}{36158}"I know what you mean.
{36160}{36208}The shower curtain|ring guy".
{36209}{36287}It's like going on a date
{36289}{36335}with a Chatty Cathy doll.
{36337}{36408}There should be|a string on your chest
{36409}{36444}that I pull out.
{36445}{36517}Except I wouldn't|pull it out, you would.
{36518}{36554}Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
{36556}{36591}By the way,
{36593}{36666}when you're telling|these little stories,
{36668}{36708}here's a good idea.
{36709}{36744}Have a point.
{36746}{36816}It makes it more interesting|for the listener.
{37150}{37197}You want to hurt me?
{37198}{37269}Go ahead if it|makes you feel better.
{37270}{37309}I'm an easy target.
{37366}{37408}Yeah, you're right.
{37409}{37452}I talk too much.
{37454}{37507}I also listen too much.
{37509}{37619}I could be a cold-hearted|cynic like you,
{37621}{37692}but I don't like to|hurt people's feelings.
{37694}{37771}Well, you think|what you want about me.
{37773}{37808}I'm not changing.
{37809}{37857}I like...I like me.
{37858}{37908}My wife likes me.
{37909}{37960}My customers like me.
{37962}{38012}'Cause I'm the real article.
{38013}{38088}What you see|is what you get.
{40670}{40776}* I'm back|in baby's arms *
{40777}{40884}* How I miss|those lovin' arms *
{40886}{40986}* I am back|where I belong *
{40988}{41109}* Back in baby's arms *
{41111}{41197}* Don't know|why we quarreled *
{41236}{41331}* We never did before *
{41333}{41411}* Since we found out|how it hurts... *
{41413}{41440}Del.
{41442}{41483}Hmm? Yeah.
{41485}{41543}Why did you kiss my ear?
{41582}{41645}Why are you holding my hand?
{41686}{41731}Where's your other hand?
{41733}{41777}Between two pillows.
{41805}{41851}Those aren't pillows!
{41853}{41881}Aah!
{41883}{41906}Oh, no!
{41908}{41978}Ooh!
{41980}{42003}Oh!
{42005}{42049}Oh! Oh!
{42297}{42356}See that Bears' game|last week?
{42357}{42395}Hell of a game.
{42397}{42449}They're going all the way.
{42451}{42519}Ohh, yeow.
{43140}{43210}Neal, take my socks|out of the sink
{43212}{43272}if you're going|to brush your teeth.
{43417}{43452}Where are you?
{43454}{43488}I'm in Wichita.
{43490}{43527}I'm at a motel
{43529}{43607}with this guy|I met on the plane.
{43609}{43678}You shared a motel room|with a stranger?
{43680}{43711}Are you crazy?
{43713}{43742}I'm getting there.
{43744}{43790}Did you call the airline?
{43792}{43873}I have a good chance|of getting on standby.
{43874}{43909}If they told you
{43910}{43955}wolverines make|good house pets,
{43957}{43988}would you believe them?
{43989}{44048}I'm not spending|Thanksgiving in Wichita.
{44049}{44085}I'll get home.
{44087}{44121}Mmm.
{44122}{44157}Not by airplane.
{44158}{44241}They got 18 hours of air traffic|backed up.
{44242}{44313}We're going to be having|our turkey roll
{44314}{44357}right here.
{44358}{44417}If we wait|for the flight.
{44418}{44475}How else can we get home?
{44477}{44547}Burt Dingman.|He works for the railroad.
{44549}{44619}I sold them all their|shower curtain rings.
{44621}{44661}He owes me a favor.
{44720}{44790}I'll get that.|I paid for everything else.
{44792}{44827}Why break precedent?
{44829}{44891}You're making me feel|like a freeloader.
{44893}{44963}Get me on the train,|we're square.
{44965}{45030}You got it.|That's the easy part.
{45126}{45173}What?
{45175}{45243}You know goddamn well what.
{45245}{45301}I'm sorry. I don't.
{45302}{45382}I had over|$700 in here.
{45383}{45477}I'm a lot of things,|but I'm not a thief.
{45479}{45550}You went into my stuff|last night, right?
{45552}{45598}I didn't take your money.
{45600}{45634}I had over $700.
{45636}{45707}You went into|my wallet for pizza.
{45709}{45778}Just maybe|when you went into...
{45780}{45806}Count it!
{45808}{45866}Like you'd keep it|in there.
{45868}{45902}There's $263 in there.
{45904}{45987}If there's more,|you can call me a thief.
{45989}{46020}Count it!
{46021}{46069}263, right?
{46145}{46172}Empty.
{46174}{46197}What?
{46355}{46392}We were robbed.
{46394}{46443}Do you think so?
{46446}{46485}I've been thinking.
{46487}{46522}What we're dealing with
{46523}{46564}is a smalltime crook.
{46566}{46625}He didn't take|the credit cards,
{46626}{46673}so we charge|our way home.
{46674}{46741}I've got a Visa|and a gasoline card.
{46743}{46789}Oh, and a Neiman-Marcus card
{46791}{46860}in case we want|to buy a gift.
{46862}{46894}What have you got?
{46896}{46953}Chalmer's Big and Tall|Men's Shoppe,
{46955}{47018}a seven-outlet chain in|the Pacific Northwest.
{47020}{47082}Unfortunately,|it does us no good here.
{47084}{47142}Get me to the train station,
{47144}{47206}and I'll take care|of everything else.
{47208}{47265}Gus' son is picking us up.
{47372}{47428}This is not him, is it?
{47430}{47473}Gee, I hope not.
{48304}{48338}Are you Gus' son?
{48340}{48378}I'm Owen.
{48437}{48503}You the shower|curtain fella?
{48505}{48553}Yeah. Yeah.|Del Griffith.
{48555}{48592}How are you?
{48594}{48650}This is Neal Page|from Chicago.
{48652}{48675}Hi.
{48677}{48726}Pleased to meet you both.
{48891}{48983}I'm to drive you to Wichita|to catch a train?
{48985}{49022}Yeah, we'd appreciate it.
{49024}{49093}Train don't run|out of Wichita.
{49094}{49161}'Lessen you're a hog|or cattle.
{49249}{49330}People train|runs out of Stubbville.
{49332}{49367}That'll be fine.
{49369}{49406}That'll be just fine.
{49456}{49502}Leave it be.
{49504}{49562}Get your lazy behind out here
{49564}{49610}and put that in back.
{49612}{49646}No. We've got it.
{49648}{49680}It's very heavy.
{49682}{49711}She don't mind.
{49713}{49767}She's short and skinny,
{49769}{49804}but she's strong.
{49806}{49866}Her first baby...
{49867}{49917}come out sideways.
{49919}{49973}She didn't scream|or nothing.
{49975}{50025}Isn't that something?
{50027}{50068}You're a real trooper.
{50070}{50132}We've got it already.|It's done.
{50220}{50289}You know, Stubbville's|a little further than Wichita.
{50291}{50330}How much further?
{50332}{50361}30 miles.
{50393}{50428}Maybe 40.
{50456}{50516}No more|than 45 though,
{50517}{50564}depending|on how he goes.
{50566}{50632}It could be anywhere|up to 70 miles.
{50634}{50674}Woof! Woof!
{50718}{50764}Give me the glove.
{50766}{50839}Ow! Just nipped.|Little part. Ooh!
{50842}{50901}Give him the goddamn glove!
{50902}{50941}Are we there yet?
{50943}{51013}No, a little way to go yet.
{51049}{51095}Beautiful country though,|isn't it?
{51097}{51160}What do you figure|the temperature is?
{51161}{51184}1 .
{51809}{51832}Thanks.
{51943}{51990}They didn't have|two together.
{51992}{52035}You got to|be kidding me.
{52037}{52072}Oh, I knew it.
{52073}{52152}The secretary was new,|and I explained it.
{52154}{52196}Oh, ge... I'm sorry.
{52197}{52234}They're just full.
{52236}{52282}It's the holidays,|I guess.
{52284}{52352}Hey, we're lucky|we got a ticket.
{52353}{52431}Yeah. So, if I don't see you again.
{52433}{52517}Want to meet for a drink|on the train?

{52596}{52661}Yeah. Anyway,|it's been interesting.

{55331}{55399}You walk a mile|to the highway.
{55401}{55471}The trucks will take you|into Jefferson City.
{56621}{56679}You're in a lousy mood, huh?
{56681}{56729}To say the least.
{56777}{56837}You ever travel|by bus before?

{61069}{61107}These were originally|handcrafted
{61109}{61167}for the Grand Wizard of China
{61169}{61215}back in the fourth century.
{61217}{61251}These aren't|the originals,

{61957}{62025}it makes you look|a little older, too.
{62027}{62105}You could pass|for 18 or 19.
{62174}{62220}Did you call the wife?
{62222}{62271}No one was home.
{62273}{62346}Probably at my daughter's|Thanksgiving pageant.
{62348}{62398}Ohh.
{62400}{62450}You missed it.
{62453}{62511}I'm sorry. Those...
{62513}{62571}those are the precious moments, too.
{62614}{62668}They don't come back again.
{62669}{62792}I've been spending too much time|away from home.
{62794}{62853}I haven't been home|in years.
{62854}{62904}What, seriously?
{62906}{62951}It's a figure of speech.
{62953}{62987}I'm away so much,
{62989}{63035}it's like not being there.
{63037}{63117}I called a friend of mine|at Eastern Airlines.
{63118}{63152}It doesn't look good.
{63153}{63221}I know.|I called all the airlines.
{63282}{63362}Well, at least we're|sitting on over 100 beans
{63364}{63404}from my brilliant idea.
{63405}{63452}You're a terrific salesman.
{63453}{63509}You know, uh...
{63510}{63608}I've been thinking that when we put|our heads together,
{63610}{63639}we really...
{63641}{63685}we've really gotten nowhere.
{63686}{63712}And, uh...
{63714}{63784}you know,|I think I'm holding you up.
{63785}{63832}Don't say that|about yourself.
{63833}{63877}That's not true, Neal.
{63878}{63974}I think we'll get|where we're going a lot faster
{63976}{64034}if, uh...|we were alone.
{64036}{64061}OK?
{64148}{64173}OK.
{64175}{64206}I see.
{64361}{64435}I think I'll just|take care of this
{64437}{64469}and get going.
{64470}{64500}I appreciate that.
{64502}{64569}It's just harder for two people|to travel.
{64570}{64593}Yeah, sure.
{64595}{64629}If you've got|reservations...
{64631}{64658}I understand.

{71529}{71590}You're fucked.
{72029}{72073}* You're messin'|with the wrong guy *
{72075}{72109}OK, 86, wake up.
{72111}{72157}You're going|to block the line.
{72159}{72193}Yeah, where you going?
{72195}{72226}Chicago.
{72228}{72250}Chicago?
{72252}{72274}Chicago.
{72276}{72329}You know you're|in St. Louis?
{72331}{72387}Yes, I do.
{72413}{72442}The airlines are faster,
{72444}{72498}and you get|a free meal.
{72500}{72533}If I wanted jokes,
{72534}{72592}I'd watch you|take a leak.
{72635}{72669}Don't just stand there
{72670}{72735}like a slab of meat|with mittens.
{73060}{73094}What are you doing?
{73096}{73165}I almost crushed your head|like a melon.
{73191}{73214}Del?
{73216}{73251}Move your car!
{73253}{73297}Just a minute, OK?
{73299}{73339}Get outta here!
{73375}{73409}What is your problem?
{73411}{73472}You insensitive asshole.
{73473}{73505}There's an injured man
{73507}{73539}down on the street.
{73541}{73586}Now, I'll move my car,
{73588}{73633}but you help him up.
{73635}{73665}No!
{73667}{73692}My pleasure.
{73747}{73789}Ohh...
{74054}{74137}I had a feeling|that when we parted ways,
{74138}{74161}somehow, someday,
{74162}{74205}our paths|would cross again.
{74230}{74262}Are you all right?
{74264}{74324}I've never seen|anyone get lifted
{74326}{74360}by his testicles before.
{74362}{74396}Lucky thing for you
{74398}{74451}that cop came when he did.
{74453}{74506}Otherwise,|you'd be lifting your schnutz
{74508}{74538}to tie your shoes.
{74540}{74612}I'm sorry.|That's terrible.
{74614}{74680}You know,|I'm glad I didn't kill you.
{74681}{74749}I'd be glad if you had.
{74750}{74801}Oh, you don't mean that.
{74803}{74872}Remember what I said?|Go with the flow.
{74873}{74944}How can I when|the rental car agency
{74945}{75024}leaves me keys|to a car that isn't there,
{75025}{75105}then I find out they|don't have any more cars?
{75107}{75173}I got a car,|no sweat at all.
{75175}{75233}Well, Del,|you're a charmed man.
{75235}{75266}Nope.
{75268}{75305}Oh, I know.
{75307}{75365}You just go|with the flow.
{75367}{75422}Like a twig|on the shoulders
{75424}{75455}of a mighty stream.
{75457}{75487}* Pulled out|of Pittsburgh *
{75489}{75541}* Rollin' down|the eastern seaboard *
{75586}{75619}* I got my diesel|wound up *
{75621}{75677}* She's runnin'|like never before *
{75733}{75797}* There's a speed zone|ahead, all right *
{75798}{75853}* I ain't seen|a cop all night *
{75854}{75900}* Six days on the road *
{75902}{75969}* And I'm gonna|make it home tonight... *
{76266}{76342}Would you please stop doing that|with the seat?
{76344}{76387}Once you screw|with these,
{76389}{76421}you never get comfortable.
{76422}{76460}Quit screwing with it.
{76461}{76491}I'm getting comfortable.
{76493}{76545}Do you have a bad back?
{76547}{76581}Well, I do,
{76582}{76648}and there's only|a couple good positions.
{76650}{76687}You're going to break it.
{76689}{76720}Ahh.
{76722}{76755}Done.
{76789}{76816}Ah, lovely.
{76842}{76873}Lovely, lovely.
{77035}{77076}Oh, damn it.
{77078}{77107}What now?
{77109}{77155}I can't reach my feet
{77157}{77203}to get my shoes off.
{77205}{77263}That's fine.|Leave your shoes on.
{77265}{77308}I can't relax|that way.
{77309}{77397}I don't care to breathe|your foot odor.
{77399}{77490}It must be swell being so perfect|and odor-free.
{77492}{77538}Things about you|bother me,
{77540}{77610}but I'm decent enough|not to bring them up.
{77612}{77653}What about me|bothers you?
{77655}{77685}There's lots of things.
{77686}{77710}Name one.
{77712}{77764}You want me to name one?
{77766}{77794}Fine, um...
{77822}{77889}you play with|your balls a lot.
{77986}{78066}I do not play|with my balls.
{78068}{78128}Larry Bird doesn't|handle the ball
{78129}{78184}as much as you do.
{78185}{78233}You trying|to start a fight?
{78234}{78277}I'm simply|stating a fact.
{78278}{78319}You fidget|with your nuts.
{78321}{78351}Know what make me happy?
{78353}{78406}Another couple of balls|and an extra set of fingers?
{78454}{78489}Oh, that's humor.
{78490}{78525}Oh, that's real humor.
{78526}{78597}I'd be happy if you rested|your mouth.
{78598}{78621}My pleasure.
{78622}{78669}I'd like a little silence.
{78670}{78693}No problem.
{78694}{78718}Thank you.
{78719}{78742}You're welcome.
{78890}{78925}You broke the seat.
{78926}{79007}You broke the goddamn seat.|I don't believe it.
{79009}{79071}It wasn't broken|when I got out.
{79073}{79104}You broke it.
{79106}{79157}It's impossible|to break them.
{79158}{79186}Impossible?
{79188}{79223}You want to drive?
{79225}{79283}No. Why did you do this?
{79333}{79397}I won't be held responsible for|faulty engineering.
{79399}{79484}This is comfortable.|This is really comfortable.
{79518}{79587}I don't want to argue.|Let's not fight.
{79589}{79623}All right, all right.
{79625}{79695}Then I'm going to sleep.|All right.
{79697}{79767}I'm putting my wallet|in the glove compartment.
{79769}{79815}Don't let me|forget it.
{79817}{79840}All right.

{81957}{82005}Weather's beginning|to clear up.
{82007}{82051}Hope you're|Enjoying your evening.
{82053}{82109}It's almost|half past the hour...
{82307}{82335}Whew.
{83090}{83128}Oh, come on.
{83260}{83299}All right.
{83432}{83454}Oh!
{83631}{83656}Oh, shit!

{84032}{84073}There you go.
{84074}{84113}OK.
{84115}{84192}Think it out.|Just relax.
{84194}{84255}Let go! Let go.
{84523}{84729}Aah!
{84922}{84962}What's happening?
{84964}{85040}Oh, we almost hit a deer.|That's all.
{85041}{85103}Are you all right?
{85105}{85179}Yes, I'm fine.|Yes, I'm fine.
{85181}{85252}It's hot in here.|Take your parka off.
{85254}{85296}Yes. Yes, I will.
{86006}{86075}Holy shit!|That guy's on the wrong side.
{86077}{86135}He's going to|kill somebody!
{86137}{86168}Oh, my God!
{86169}{86212}Hey!
{86243}{86267}Hey!
{86329}{86387}Hey, what's going on?
{86389}{86437}Some joker wants to race.
{86469}{86494}Turn around!
{86496}{86557}Don't race.|It's ridiculous.
{86559}{86622}All right, come on.|Let's go. Let's go.
{86624}{86665}Put your window down!
{86666}{86703}He wants something.
{86705}{86750}He's probably drunk.
{86752}{86811}You're going|the wrong way!
{86813}{86840}What?
{86842}{86908}You're going|the wrong way!
{86945}{87011}He says we're going|the wrong way.
{87013}{87047}Oh, he's drunk.
{87049}{87106}How would he know|where we're going?
{87108}{87171}Yeah, how would he know?
{87173}{87227}Thank you.|Thanks a lot.
{87229}{87263}Terrific.
{87265}{87287}Thank you.
{87321}{87353}What a moron.
{87400}{87463}You're going in|the wrong direction!
{87571}{87646}You're going to kill somebody!
{87845}{87896}You're going|the wrong way!
{88009}{88043}Truck. Truck.
{88045}{88068}What?
{88107}{88265}Aah!
{88266}{88304}Ah ha ha ha ha!
{88306}{88373}Ah ha ha ha ha!
{89570}{89620}Well, this isn't so bad.
{89622}{89704}I thought it would be|a lot worse than this.
{89705}{89783}They'll be able|to buff this out.
{89785}{89820}Oh, yeah.
{89901}{89932}Wow!
{89965}{90039}I mean,|that was close.
{90041}{90128}We can laugh about it now.|We're all right.
{90129}{90192}The whole, uh...
{90193}{90292}Maybe we should just get my stuff|off the road, huh?
{90294}{90342}What do you think? Yeah.
{90344}{90390}Yeah, that's a good idea.
{90436}{90481}Oh, my back!
{90483}{90519}Ohh!
{90540}{90565}God.
{90612}{90645}Ohh!
{90646}{90676}Ohh!
{91056}{91106}Come on.|Here we go.
{91108}{91150}Thanks.
{91152}{91222}Oh. Set it down|for a second.
{91368}{91441}Whew. What a night.
{92714}{92737}What?
{92766}{92796}What?
{92798}{92881}You finally did it|to yourself.
{92882}{92908}Huh?
{92994}{93065}I mean, good luck|turning the car in.
{93066}{93149}They'll be happy as pigs in shit|to see you.
{93389}{93457}How could you|rent the thing anyway
{93458}{93493}without a credit card?
{93494}{93556}You couldn't.|How could you do it?
{93558}{93629}I gave this gal|behind the counter
{93630}{93689}a set of|shower curtain rings.
{93864}{93908}You can't rent a car
{93910}{93946}with shower curtain rings.
{94186}{94233}Well, uh...
{94234}{94293}somehow your, uh...
{94294}{94377}diner's club card|wound up in my wallet,
{94378}{94437}and l, uh, just...
{94438}{94476}You stole it!
{94478}{94501}Not exactly.
{94502}{94537}You stole my card!
{94538}{94569}I didn't.
{94570}{94651}You stole my card, rented a car,|then burned it up!
{94654}{94711}I found it|in my wallet!
{94713}{94767}I thought you|put it there.
{94769}{94806}Why would I do that?
{94808}{94840}Kindness?
{94841}{94897}Kindness?
{94899}{94931}Kindness?
{94933}{94967}You stole it!
{94969}{95003}He stole it!
{95005}{95096}No, I didn't.|I was going to send it back to you
{95097}{95169}with whatever the rental car|charge was, plus interest.
{95171}{95229}You didn't give me your address.|What could I do?
{95230}{95263}You just ditched me.
{95265}{95323}I had no money,|no cards, nothing.
{95325}{95353}Give it back!
{95354}{95377}I can't!
{95428}{95450}Why not?
{95452}{95475}Because!
{95509}{95535}Because why?
{95537}{95595}When we stopped|to gas up,
{95597}{95667}I put the card back|in your wallet.
{95900}{95932}Ohh.
{95957}{96002}Are you mad at me?
{96028}{96069}Ohh!
{96071}{96123}Ohh!
{96385}{96441}You know,|you could've killed me,
{96443}{96514}slugging me in the gut|when I wasn't ready.
{96516}{96562}That's how Houdini died.
{96691}{96725}Ow. Ah!
{96791}{96837}One good thing about it...
{96839}{96922}with all this fresh air,|we'll sleep like babies.
{96923}{96981}Neal? Hey, hey, Neal,|Wait up.
{97038}{97073}I need one room.
{97075}{97145}If you're pissed at me,|we can get separate rooms.
{97147}{97181}Get your own room.
{97183}{97241}I'll need|a major credit card.
{97243}{97297}All right.|All right.
{97358}{97398}I have, uh...
{97422}{97460}Diner's...
{97498}{97521}Visa...
{97567}{97605}and a gasoline card.
{97639}{97665}Uh...
{97692}{97759}these aren't, uh,|credit cards.
{97761}{97834}All right,|I'll pay cash. Cash.
{97836}{97874}$42.50.
{98059}{98134}How about... $17?
{98166}{98208}I can't do that.
{98210}{98235}Please.
{98237}{98284}Have mercy.
{98286}{98352}I've been wearing|the same underwear
{98353}{98397}since Tuesday.
{98398}{98442}I can vouch for that.
{98505}{98576}I don't... I don't...|I don't own the place.
{98733}{98824}$17 and a hell of a nice watch.
{99030}{99053}Ouch.
{99194}{99244}Um, would you|like a room?
{99401}{99458}I got a slight problem here.
{99460}{99514}I don't have the $42.50.
{99516}{99598}You have $17|and a good watch?
{99600}{99671}No, I don't.|I have, uh...
{99748}{99814}I have $2.00|and, uh...
{99876}{99914}and a Casio.
{99990}{100016}Mmm.
{100018}{100091}I'm going to have to say|good night, so...
{101238}{101269}Well, Marie,
{101270}{101365}once again, my dear,|you were as right as rain.
{101398}{101445}I am, without a doubt,
{101446}{101505}the biggest pain in the butt
{101506}{101565}that ever came down the pike.
{101594}{101673}I meet someone whose|company I really enjoy,
{101674}{101721}and what do I do?
{101750}{101785}I go overboard.
{101786}{101833}I smother the poor soul.
{101834}{101879}I cause him more trouble
{101881}{101939}than he has a right to.
{101974}{102036}God, I got a big mouth.
{102089}{102137}Ohh.
{102169}{102239}When am I ever|going to wake up?
{102708}{102791}I wish you were here|with me right now.
{102877}{102926}But I guess...
{102928}{102973}that's not|going to happen.
{103017}{103056}Not now, anyway.
{103101}{103135}What did I do
{103137}{103207}to get hooked up|with this guy?
{103639}{103709}You're going to|freeze to death out there.
{103873}{103905}How's your drink?
{103907}{103933}Good.
{103979}{104013}Go for another one?
{104015}{104049}Where you been?
{104051}{104085}You been to Italy?
{104087}{104122}You had amaretto?
{104123}{104193}I have amaretto,|and this is a gin.
{104195}{104241}Is there a tequila there?
{104243}{104289}Ahem. A little Mexican trip.
{104291}{104313}Tequila?
{104315}{104358}Here you go.|Coming up.
{104360}{104419}Is this a good combo or what?
{104423}{104472}No, probably not.
{104473}{104597}Me, I'm going|back to, uh, Jamaica.
{104599}{104628}Jamaica, man.
{104629}{104700}Go to Jamaica.|Have some rum, man.
{104701}{104728}Dig it.
{104730}{104782}Iree, iree, man.
{104844}{104890}Oh, shit.
{104952}{105022}You know,|when I'm dead and buried,
{105024}{105094}all I'll have|to prove I was here
{105096}{105142}was some shower curtain rings
{105144}{105178}that didn't fall down.
{105180}{105217}Great legacy, huh?
{105219}{105262}At the very least,
{105264}{105310}at the absolute minimum,
{105312}{105373}you've got a woman|you love
{105375}{105436}to grow old with, right?
{105438}{105501}You love her, don't you?
{105624}{105694}Love is not a big enough word.
{105696}{105754}It's not a big enough word
{105756}{105829}for how I feel|about my wife.
{105831}{105867}To the wives.
{105869}{105899}To the wives.
{106056}{106095}Wow.
{106128}{106209}Well, let me just|close this conversation
{106210}{106281}by saying you are|one unique individual.
{106330}{106365}What is unique?
{106366}{106425}Uh... latin for asshole?
{106426}{106497}Grab those.|I'm going to kick them off.
{106555}{106652}As much trouble as I've had|on this little journey,
{106654}{106737}I'm sure one day|I'll look back and laugh.
{106738}{106772}You think so?
{106773}{106833}Oh, I'm laughing already.
{106834}{106857}Oh, God.
{106858}{106920}Oh, when that car blew up.
{106921}{106977}Was that seat hot or what?
{106978}{107054}I feel like a big whopper.
{107056}{107120}Turn me over.|I'm done on this side.
{107122}{107193}I'm afraid|to look at my ass.
{107194}{107289}I'm going to have|those griddle marks on my ass.
{107366}{107421}Ha ha ha.|Potato chips.
{107470}{107505}They're everywhere!
{107506}{107553}Aah!
{107554}{107592}Ha ha ha!
{107593}{107641}This feels|like summer camp.
{107642}{107739}Ha ha ha! aah!
{108022}{108093}Now how the hell|does this turn off?
{108094}{108117}Ow!
{108178}{108216}Aah!
{108219}{108249}You all set?
{108250}{108285}Just a minute.
{108286}{108333}Give it a good push.
{108334}{108357}All right.
{108358}{108381}All right.
{108382}{108417}Oh, geez.
{108490}{108549}Push! Put some oomph into it!
{108550}{108585}I am! I am!
{108587}{108623}Push, for Christ sake!
{108653}{108693}We have to rock it.
{108694}{108732}All right. OK.
{108734}{108802}Up and down.|Here we go. Ready?
{108804}{108828}Yeah.
{108829}{108861}Here we go.
{108862}{108889}Reverse!
{109086}{109108}Aww!
{109128}{109156}Huh.
{109284}{109310}Get in!
{109428}{109456}Go!
{109844}{109951}* Blue moon of Kentucky,|keep on shining *
{109953}{110046}* Shine on the one that's|gone and been untrue *
{110048}{110144}* Blue moon of Kentucky,|keep on shining *
{110146}{110229}* Shine on the one who's|gone and left me blue *
{110230}{110299}* It was|on a moonlit night *
{110301}{110354}* Stars shinin' bright *
{110356}{110398}* They whispered|from on high *
{110400}{110450}* Your love|has said good-bye *
{110452}{110539}* Blue moon of Kentucky,|keep on shining *
{110775}{110805}Oh.
{110866}{110925}Oh, great.|Great. A cop.
{110926}{110949}Watch it!
{110950}{110997}How fast|are you going?
{110998}{111057}I can't tell.|The speedometer's melted.
{111058}{111095}Pull over.
{111097}{111140}Top of the morning,|officer.
{111142}{111164}Hi.
{111166}{111237}Is there something|I can help you with?
{111238}{111285}What the hell you driving?
{111286}{111364}We had a small fire|last night.
{111365}{111452}You have any idea how fast|you were going?
{111454}{111489}Our speedometer's melted.
{111490}{111573}It's hard to say|with any degree of accuracy
{111574}{111640}how fast we were going.
{111642}{111692}78 miles an hour.
{111720}{111754}78, huh?
{111756}{111826}Well, yeah.|I can buy that. Sure.
{111828}{111874}You'd know better than us,
{111876}{111921}especially since|our speedometer's melted.
{111922}{112005}You feel this vehicle is safe|for highway travel?
{112006}{112041}Yes, I do.
{112042}{112077}It's not pretty,
{112078}{112164}but it will get you|where you want to go.
{112165}{112209}You got no outside mirror.
{112210}{112236}It's lost.
{112237}{112281}You have no|functioning gauges.
{112282}{112323}No, not a one.
{112325}{112376}However, the radio still works.
{112378}{112425}Funny as that may seem,
{112426}{112509}the radio's the only thing|that's really working good.
{112510}{112545}Don't ask me how.
{112595}{112647}I can't let you go.
{112649}{112676}Can't what?
{112678}{112737}It's not fit|for the road.
{112738}{112785}The vehicle|will be impounded
{112786}{112845}until it's made|safe for travel.
{112846}{112917}OK, officer, I admit|I broke the law,
{112918}{112977}and for that|I'm really sorry.
{112978}{113013}You got me there,
{113014}{113085}and I won't argue|one iota, I swear.
{113086}{113109}However, um...
{113111}{113157}if you impound our car,
{113158}{113229}I'll be unable|to get my friend home
{113230}{113265}for his Thanksgiving dinner.
{113997}{114059}Well, our ship has come in.
{114194}{114255}It's free and it's nonstop.
{114257}{114319}I said I'd get you home.
{114321}{114368}Just so the heater's working.
{114369}{114415}The driver's a little freaky
{114417}{114481}about people riding|in his cab.
{114483}{114523}We can't sit there.
{114525}{114593}Then where are we|supposed to ride?
{114645}{114679}Beats walking, huh?
{114717}{114787}You know,|you're going to be in Chicago
{114789}{114857}in less than three hours,|around there,
{114859}{114905}if we don't hit traffic,
{114907}{114989}and I don't think we should|since it's Thanksgiving.
{115015}{115049}We're moving now.
{115826}{115865}You believe this?
{115867}{115937}It's been a hell of a trip.
{115939}{115961}Sure has.
{115963}{116034}But, uh, after all|is said and done,
{116035}{116081}you did get me home.
{116083}{116161}Next time, let's go first class,|all right?
{116162}{116233}God, I hope there|isn't a next time.
{116234}{116256}I know.
{116333}{116368}This you?
{116417}{116440}Yeah.
{116543}{116590}It's been great meeting you.
{116591}{116661}I'm sorry if I caused|you any trouble.
{116663}{116697}You got me home,
{116698}{116747}and, uh...|a little late.
{116749}{116788}A couple days.
{116789}{116824}But, uh...
{116825}{116876}I'm a little wiser, too.
{116877}{116919}Me, too.
{116945}{116980}Happy holidays.
{116982}{117012}Same to you.
{117062}{117099}Happy Thanksgiving, Neal.
{117101}{117160}Give my love to the family.
{117161}{117211}Maybe I'll meet them someday.
{117213}{117268}Say hello to Marie for me.
{117269}{117301}Yeah.
{117329}{117376}So...OK.
{117377}{117433}And you have|a happy Thanksgiving.
{117434}{117484}Hey, you know it.
{117485}{117525}So long.
{119530}{119593}I like...|I like me.
{119594}{119631}My wife likes me.
{119698}{119772}At the very least,|the absolute minimum,
{119774}{119833}you've got|a woman you love
{119834}{119881}to grow old with, right?
{120005}{120064}I'm spending|too much time away.
{120066}{120120}I haven't been home|in years.
{120122}{120181}I haven't been home|in years.
{120182}{120241}I haven't been home|in years.
{120773}{120839}Del, what are you|doing here?
{120985}{121043}You said you were going home.
{121045}{121092}What are you doing here?
{121129}{121163}I, uh...
{121237}{121281}I don't have a home.
{121441}{121499}Marie's been dead|for eight years.
{122365}{122447}Boy, you are|one lucky guy, Neal.
{122449}{122501}I know.
{122503}{122543}I won't stay long.
{122545}{122591}Maybe I'll just say hi,
{122593}{122639}then be on my way.
{122641}{122674}Just come on.
{123109}{123141}Hi ya, kiddo.
