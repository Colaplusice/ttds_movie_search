1
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,139
September 21, 1945.
That was the night I died.

2
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,938
Damn tramps.

3
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:03,363
Watch it!

4
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:05,868
Disgusting!

5
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:07,375
Is he dead?

6
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:09,605
The Americans'll be arriving
any day now.

7
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:12,648
It's disgraceful,
having these bums here!

8
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:23,827
Mama...!

9
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:28,653
What day is it?

10
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:41,675
Setsuko...

11
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:53,619
Another one.

12
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,562
What is this stuff?

13
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:11,641
Never mind. Just dump it!

14
00:02:23,887 --> 00:02:26,355
This one's a goner, too.

15
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:29,425
You can see it in their eyes.

24
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:59,500
Air raid!
Get to the shelters!

25
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,079
We're in for a big one!

26
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:07,514
The shelter behind the firehouse
should be safest!

27
00:05:11,822 --> 00:05:13,119
It's hot!

28
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:16,420
Be a good girl.
Try to be patient.

29
00:05:20,464 --> 00:05:23,729
I'd better get over to the shelter.

30
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:27,270
Be careful, and get over there
as soon as you can.

31
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:30,404
Setsuko, be a good girl
and mind your brother.

32
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,701
Never mind us!
Get to the shelter!

33
00:05:32,843 --> 00:05:34,936
Yes, yes.

34
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:38,112
Mom, do you have your medicine?

35
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:41,082
Right here. Don't worry.

36
00:05:44,988 --> 00:05:46,956
I hate the shelter!

37
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:50,493
Well, you'll be sorry
if you get blown up by a bomb!

38
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:51,583
Now get on.

39
00:05:57,601 --> 00:05:59,569
My doll!

40
00:06:11,515 --> 00:06:13,608
Air raid!

41
00:06:13,717 --> 00:06:15,685
Seita!

42
00:06:28,265 --> 00:06:30,233
Get down!

43
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:34,363
Seita!

44
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,308
Seita!

45
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:49,121
Long live the Emperor!

46
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:12,822
We're safe here. Don't worry.

47
00:10:13,857 --> 00:10:16,485
Where's Mama?

48
00:10:16,593 --> 00:10:19,061
In the shelter.

49
00:10:19,763 --> 00:10:24,132
The firehouse shelter can take
a hit from a 250-kilo bomb easy.

50
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:25,724
Don't worry about her.

51
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:40,679
She'll probably go to
Niponmatsu station to find us.

52
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:42,843
We'll meet her there.

53
00:10:43,153 --> 00:10:46,054
Let's just catch our breath first.

54
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,761
Are you okay, Setsuko?

55
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:56,832
I lost one of my shoes.

56
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:01,337
I'll buy you better ones.

57
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,102
I have money.

58
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:13,178
Open this.

59
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:26,357
Wow, you're rich.

60
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:37,801
Black rain, from the bombing.

61
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:18,881
It's all gone!

62
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:26,386
Look, that was the civic hall.
We ate lunch there, once.

63
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:31,390
Is our house gone too?

64
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:32,927
Probably.

65
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:35,395
What'll we do?

66
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:38,496
Dad'll make them pay for this!

67
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:56,352
Mother!

68
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:10,155
Well, it's not like I was
the only one who lost his house.

69
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,496
We're all in the same boat.

70
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:19,675
At least we're still alive.

71
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:25,579
There were two direct hits.
The fires are impossible to put out!

72
00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:29,118
When you try to smother them,
it just spreads the oil around.

73
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:31,779
It's not her.
She's not down here!

74
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:38,227
Seita, I have to pee.

75
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:54,101
All residents of
Ichirizuka and Kaminishi!

76
00:13:54,210 --> 00:14:00,012
Please report to the elementary
school for first aid services!

77
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:01,083
What's wrong?

78
00:14:01,184 --> 00:14:02,617
My eye hurts.

79
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:04,687
Don't rub it.

80
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:07,952
We'll get it washed out
at the school.

81
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:10,651
Where's Mama?

82
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,660
- She'll be at the school.
- School?

83
00:14:12,762 --> 00:14:15,356
Uh-huh. Let's go.

84
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,049
Seita!

85
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:38,110
Have you seen your mom?

86
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:41,280
She's hurt.
You'd better go.

87
00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:43,883
I'll watch your sister.

88
00:14:43,993 --> 00:14:46,894
Wasn't that scary, Setsuko?
Did you cry?

89
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:51,060
Seita has to go somewhere.
Why don't we wait for him?

90
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:03,072
Seita. I've been looking for you.
Are you okay?

91
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:05,079
- My mom...?
- This way.

92
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:16,757
This IS your mother's,
isn't it?

93
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:21,363
In here.

94
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:35,169
She's finally asleep.

95
00:15:38,114 --> 00:15:43,074
She really should be
in a proper hospital.

96
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:47,882
I think Kaisei hospital
in Nishinomiya wasn't hit.

97
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:54,124
My mother has heart trouble.
Can she get her medicine?

98
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,391
I'll ask.

99
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:01,763
I'll be around
if you need me.

100
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,210
Mom...

101
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,861
You saw her?

102
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:34,302
It's terrible.

103
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,934
I'm thirsty.

104
00:16:41,577 --> 00:16:44,011
If there's anything I can do,
just ask.

105
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:49,313
Oh, did you get
your biscuit ration yet?

106
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:51,887
I'll get it for you!

107
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:06,261
Keep this ring in your purse.
Don't lose it.

108
00:17:07,136 --> 00:17:11,266
Mom's hurt.
She'll get better, though.

109
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:13,565
Where is she?

110
00:17:14,143 --> 00:17:16,611
In the hospital. In Nishinomiya.

111
00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:24,643
We'll stay here
at the school tonight.

112
00:17:24,754 --> 00:17:29,123
Then tomorrow we'll go to our
aunt's place in Nishinomiya.

113
00:17:31,227 --> 00:17:32,626
Okay?

114
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:46,775
We'll all be on the second floor.
Why don't you stop by later?

115
00:17:49,912 --> 00:17:52,574
Thanks a lot. We will.

116
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:55,883
See you later, Setsuko.

117
00:17:58,421 --> 00:18:00,150
Want some?

118
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:03,020
I want to see Mama.

119
00:18:04,393 --> 00:18:07,089
Maybe tomorrow.
It's too late now.

120
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:02,750
Watch me,
I'm good at this!

121
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:30,208
We haven't unbandaged her.
You don't want to see the body.

122
00:19:30,413 --> 00:19:33,905
With this heat we're having,
she'll have to go on the truck today.

123
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,261
Where's your sister?

124
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:56,702
In Nishinomiya.
We have a distant aunt there.

125
00:19:56,806 --> 00:19:59,434
I think she'll take care of us.

126
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:02,102
I see. Lucky for you.

127
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:06,614
I'd better get back to work.
Good luck to you.

128
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:35,799
Mama!

129
00:21:35,905 --> 00:21:38,465
Where is she?

130
00:21:38,574 --> 00:21:41,407
Is she still sick?

131
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,478
Yeah. Still sick.

132
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:45,547
Welcome back.

133
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:50,379
How's your mother?
Is she at Kaisei?

134
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:55,456
Lucky your dad's in the Navy.

135
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:59,221
You get to have a truck
help move you over here!

136
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:03,322
I've laid out futons and
mosquito netting in your room.

137
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:04,831
Thanks.

138
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:16,345
Doesn't Mama need her ring?

139
00:22:17,513 --> 00:22:20,641
Did she give it to me?

140
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:28,350
Just be careful
you don't lose it.

141
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:36,931
Mom's...

142
00:22:38,634 --> 00:22:42,263
When Mom's a little better,
I'll take you to see her.

143
00:22:43,973 --> 00:22:46,203
Time for bed. Okay?

144
00:24:40,422 --> 00:24:44,688
Dried bonito, herring,
dried potato, eggs,

145
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:47,193
and pickled plums.

146
00:24:47,596 --> 00:24:50,861
And I do believe this is butter!

147
00:24:53,536 --> 00:24:56,027
You can't get these
for ANYTHI NG nowadays.

148
00:24:56,438 --> 00:24:59,407
Soldiers always get the best
at times like these.

149
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:02,742
Anyway, did you
stop by the hospital?

150
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,445
I'd like to tell your mother
what's been happening.

151
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,519
And I could take Setsuko along
to visit her.

152
00:25:12,555 --> 00:25:14,113
That bad?!

153
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:17,659
Mom died while she was
still at the school.

154
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,729
What?! She's dead!

155
00:25:22,097 --> 00:25:27,933
Then why didn't you tell me?
Why were you hiding it?!

156
00:25:28,037 --> 00:25:31,063
I didn't want Setsuko to know.

157
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:36,400
Dead... How awful!

158
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,749
You'd best write your father
and tell him!

159
00:25:46,522 --> 00:25:48,513
Seita!

160
00:25:48,624 --> 00:25:51,752
Look!
She bought me new shoes!

161
00:25:53,796 --> 00:25:55,388
Good for you, Setsuko.

162
00:25:55,497 --> 00:25:57,260
Hello there!

163
00:26:15,618 --> 00:26:17,882
You poor dears.

164
00:26:17,987 --> 00:26:19,955
Thanks, ma'am.

165
00:26:23,058 --> 00:26:25,219
What's that?

166
00:26:25,628 --> 00:26:29,223
Bullfrogs.
Nothing to be scared of.

167
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:31,128
Firefly!

168
00:26:38,674 --> 00:26:41,108
Try to catch it.

169
00:26:46,015 --> 00:26:47,915
Whoops! Squashed it.

170
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:50,451
Ew! It smells!

171
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:53,012
You squeezed too hard.

172
00:27:20,883 --> 00:27:24,046
There're millions of them!

173
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:39,757
Setsuko, close your eyes
and say "ah."

174
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,301
Why?

175
00:27:41,403 --> 00:27:43,132
Just do it. "Ah."

176
00:27:55,017 --> 00:27:57,144
Fruit drop!

177
00:27:57,786 --> 00:28:00,880
Fruit drop! Fruit drop!

178
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:14,834
I almost swallowed it.

179
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,180
- We're home.
- Where were you?

180
00:28:37,126 --> 00:28:39,356
Did you thank the lady?

181
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:40,951
Yes, ma'am.

182
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:45,626
That food looked good.

183
00:29:14,363 --> 00:29:17,855
Seita. Shouldn't you be
going to school?

184
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,297
Or something?

185
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:23,929
Yeah, but the steelworks
they had me working in was bombed.

186
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:27,270
And my school burned down.
There's no place to go.

187
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:31,002
Well, I hope
you've written to your father.

188
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:33,980
I already sent a letter
through the Naval Office.

189
00:29:34,082 --> 00:29:35,481
When?

190
00:29:35,584 --> 00:29:38,485
Just after we came here.
About 10 days ago?

191
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:41,956
That's strange.

192
00:29:42,691 --> 00:29:45,285
There should have been
a reply by now.

193
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:50,556
Return the scissors when you've
finished with them, Setsuko.

194
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:00,737
How's the war effort?

195
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:03,744
It's starting to look hopeless.

196
00:30:04,146 --> 00:30:07,673
The more factories we lose,
the harder the others have to work.

197
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:11,183
We're getting ready for
when they finally invade.

198
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:17,583
You're right. That's why food's
getting so hard to find.

199
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:23,023
Our soldiers aren't the only ones
who are suffering.

200
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:27,660
You work for our country's
defense too, young lady.

201
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:31,333
You eat up and work
as hard as you can!

202
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,446
Not again.

203
00:30:40,749 --> 00:30:43,445
So you've taken in
a couple of homeless children?

204
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:49,422
Poor things. To lose their
mother when they're so young.

205
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:51,955
What's wrong? Itch?

206
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,393
It's hot. I hate shelters!

207
00:30:55,497 --> 00:30:58,864
Just hang on. Don't worry,
I'm here for you.

208
00:31:09,811 --> 00:31:11,779
Wanna go to the beach?

209
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,576
Yeah! Yeah! Let's go!

210
00:31:29,364 --> 00:31:32,492
It's all vegetable fields now.

211
00:32:30,525 --> 00:32:32,686
What're they doing?

212
00:32:33,095 --> 00:32:34,824
Making sea salt.

213
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:38,331
It's because all the salt
and soy sauce is rationed.

214
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:40,992
Hurry up, Setsuko!

215
00:33:10,132 --> 00:33:11,963
It might be a little cold.

216
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:13,625
Cold!

217
00:33:15,737 --> 00:33:18,934
Feels good, right?
You won't itch now.

218
00:33:26,648 --> 00:33:29,242
It's a big bathtub!

219
00:33:29,618 --> 00:33:30,846
HEY!

220
00:33:36,158 --> 00:33:38,490
Come back here!

221
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:46,425
Grrr, I'm a bear!
I'm gonna eat you!

222
00:34:09,658 --> 00:34:12,923
Snip... Snip... Snip...

223
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:20,528
What's wrong?
Is he sleeping?

224
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:31,412
Don't look at that.

225
00:34:34,316 --> 00:34:37,410
When it gets a little warmer,
I'll teach you how to swim.

226
00:34:39,654 --> 00:34:42,623
We'll swim,
and that'll make us hungry.

227
00:34:47,095 --> 00:34:49,359
We'll swim,
and that'll make us hungry.

228
00:34:57,772 --> 00:34:59,330
Seita!

229
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:03,033
Setsuko! Come on!

230
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,310
You're hungry, aren't you?

231
00:35:11,419 --> 00:35:14,877
There's food here for you.

232
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:50,219
Mother! Were you waiting long?
It's good to see you again.

233
00:35:50,759 --> 00:35:52,727
Are you alright here?

234
00:35:52,827 --> 00:35:56,285
I'm fine. Don't worry!
They're very nice here.

235
00:35:56,398 --> 00:35:58,332
I'm hungry.

236
00:36:00,502 --> 00:36:03,665
Let's get home
before we're caught in the raid.

237
00:36:03,772 --> 00:36:07,003
I'm tired. Carry me.

238
00:36:09,177 --> 00:36:11,008
Air raid!

239
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:25,592
Your mother won't be needing
her kimonos anymore.

240
00:36:25,694 --> 00:36:28,254
Why don't you trade them
for some rice.

241
00:36:28,363 --> 00:36:33,699
I've been trading off my things
bit by bit for food.

242
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:37,031
<i>You can probably get
a full toh of rice for them.</i>

243
00:36:37,138 --> 00:36:38,230
That much?

244
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,308
You need your nourishment.

245
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:43,707
You can't be a soldier
if you don't grow up healthy.

246
00:36:43,878 --> 00:36:45,778
<i>A whole toh of rice?</i>

247
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,112
Your mother would be glad
you didn't just let them go to waste.

248
00:36:50,218 --> 00:36:52,482
Why don't I take them?

249
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:54,388
NO!

250
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,015
Setsuko. You're awake?

251
00:36:57,125 --> 00:37:01,755
No! No! They're Mama's!

252
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,965
They're Mama's!
Don't take them!

253
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,798
Setsuko. Let them go!

254
00:37:11,673 --> 00:37:14,301
Setsuko. Setsuko.

255
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:56,780
Fine rice, isn't it?

256
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:01,978
We'll have a proper
rice dinner tonight, Setsuko.

257
00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:07,121
Here, this is yours.

258
00:38:14,836 --> 00:38:17,430
White rice, Setsuko!

259
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,715
Here you go.

260
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:34,485
With my daughter and our lodger
working overtime so much...

261
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:37,456
I've felt bad
not having rice to give them.

262
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:41,792
It's great, huh?
Real white rice!

263
00:38:45,066 --> 00:38:46,533
More!

264
00:38:46,634 --> 00:38:48,329
Yes, yes.

265
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:54,766
You're just gobbling it down
tonight, aren't you, Setsuko?

266
00:38:54,876 --> 00:38:56,241
It's good!

267
00:39:02,183 --> 00:39:03,673
What's wrong?

268
00:39:03,785 --> 00:39:06,515
I don't want rice porridge!

269
00:39:07,055 --> 00:39:09,353
Don't we have
any more pickled plums?

270
00:39:09,457 --> 00:39:12,585
We finished those off ages ago.

271
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:15,162
Here's your lunch.

272
00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:18,198
- Thanks. I'd better get going.
- See you.

273
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,999
- Bye.
- Take care.

274
00:39:23,104 --> 00:39:26,335
We'll have rice balls for lunch.
Just hold on 'til then.

275
00:39:26,441 --> 00:39:30,400
Stop that!
You'll have it for lunch too!

276
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:34,012
You think
a lazy slug like you deserves...

277
00:39:34,115 --> 00:39:38,017
the same as people
who work for our nation?!

278
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:45,192
Seita, you're old enough to know
everyone has to cooperate.

279
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:49,290
You keep saying you want rice,
but do you earn it?

280
00:39:49,397 --> 00:39:51,797
No, you absolutely do not!

281
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:06,247
I even give you some rice,
and you still complain!

282
00:40:06,347 --> 00:40:08,907
But it's our rice.

283
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:12,547
Oh, so now
I'm cheating you, am I?

284
00:40:12,654 --> 00:40:18,058
How dare you say that!
After I take you two in!

285
00:40:19,527 --> 00:40:20,721
Fine!

286
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:25,823
We'll just make our
OWN dinners from now on!

287
00:40:25,934 --> 00:40:30,337
Seita, you have other relatives
in Tokyo, don't you?

288
00:40:30,438 --> 00:40:33,464
On your mother's side of the family?

289
00:40:33,575 --> 00:40:39,172
Why not write to them?
WE could be bombed any day!

290
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,578
Problem is,
I don't know their address.

291
00:40:50,525 --> 00:40:52,049
Let's go home.

292
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,357
Uh-huh. Papa's waiting for us.

293
00:40:55,597 --> 00:41:00,500
Frogs are singing,
it's time to go home

294
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:07,069
Sorry you had to wait so long.

295
00:41:10,612 --> 00:41:12,136
What's wrong?

296
00:41:12,247 --> 00:41:15,410
I'm hungry.
And I'm thirsty too.

297
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:17,109
Okay.

298
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:23,523
Here, have a fruit drop.

299
00:41:24,492 --> 00:41:27,757
Mom has 7000 yen in the bank.

300
00:41:28,429 --> 00:41:33,731
7000. That's enough to live on,
so don't worry.

301
00:41:36,271 --> 00:41:41,368
I'm telling Dad to write back soon,
because you're waiting.

302
00:41:51,486 --> 00:41:53,454
You're in luck.

303
00:41:53,755 --> 00:41:58,920
You can't buy a stove
like this easily nowadays.

304
00:41:59,093 --> 00:42:05,032
It's almost impossible to find
any hardware to sell.

305
00:42:07,201 --> 00:42:11,570
I'll take that comb, and...
Do you have an umbrella?

306
00:42:11,673 --> 00:42:14,699
An umbrella... Oh, yes!

307
00:42:15,343 --> 00:42:18,938
It's raining, it's raining

308
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:24,917
Big brother's coming home
with an umbrella just for me

309
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:29,149
Drip-drop, plip-plop
Down the rain comes!

310
00:42:41,135 --> 00:42:43,035
That's got it!

311
00:42:43,137 --> 00:42:44,968
Be careful with that fire.

312
00:42:45,073 --> 00:42:46,802
Right.

313
00:42:49,277 --> 00:42:51,541
What are they up to?

314
00:42:51,646 --> 00:42:54,080
They're doing their own cooking.

315
00:42:54,182 --> 00:42:58,050
Good for them!
More, please.

316
00:42:58,152 --> 00:43:00,985
Mother,
did you scold them again?

317
00:43:01,422 --> 00:43:04,323
Yes, but they refuse to apologize.

318
00:43:04,425 --> 00:43:08,657
And that boy even bought a stove.
Just to spite me!

319
00:43:09,797 --> 00:43:11,765
Finished!

320
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,261
Bad manners, Seita.

321
00:43:19,574 --> 00:43:23,135
Doesn't matter.
We can sit any way we want.

322
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:34,451
Rice for two.

323
00:43:34,555 --> 00:43:36,045
That's it?

324
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:39,593
Next ration will be in July.

325
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,619
Let me!

326
00:45:42,617 --> 00:45:44,050
Like it?

327
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:53,590
It's all different tastes!

328
00:45:53,694 --> 00:45:58,563
Grape, strawberry, melon, mint.
All in there. Drink it all.

329
00:46:09,243 --> 00:46:11,677
All gone.

330
00:46:14,955 --> 00:46:19,051
Great.
Left the dishes for me to do.

331
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,653
So selfish.

332
00:46:21,761 --> 00:46:24,730
Honestly!
Those brats are two of the worst!

333
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:27,633
Not again!

334
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:29,291
Mama!

335
00:46:29,402 --> 00:46:33,168
Seita, my daughter and
that man work for our nation!

336
00:46:33,273 --> 00:46:36,538
We can't have her crying
keeping them awake.

337
00:46:36,643 --> 00:46:41,876
We've enough trouble
getting sleep with the air raids!

338
00:47:08,942 --> 00:47:13,038
Report from
Central Military Division.

339
00:47:13,146 --> 00:47:18,015
Several waves of
enemy bombers are approaching.

340
00:47:18,118 --> 00:47:20,609
Going to the shelter again, Seita?

341
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,453
You're old enough to
help fight the fires, aren't you?

342
00:47:36,636 --> 00:47:42,302
I want to go home.
I hate living with her!

343
00:47:44,144 --> 00:47:47,045
We don't have a house
to go back to.

344
00:48:00,227 --> 00:48:05,255
With a great big streamer
shaped like a carp

345
00:48:05,365 --> 00:48:07,390
And longer than a house

346
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:11,529
The big one's the Papa

347
00:48:11,771 --> 00:48:14,239
The little ones the kids

348
00:48:14,341 --> 00:48:15,808
Stop it!

349
00:48:15,909 --> 00:48:18,571
Don't you realize
there's a war going on?!

350
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:20,805
You two are nothing
but trouble for me!

351
00:48:22,415 --> 00:48:25,316
A couple of pests,
that's what you are!

352
00:48:25,418 --> 00:48:29,252
You're no help at all
during the raids.

353
00:48:29,356 --> 00:48:33,816
You could just go and LIVE in
that shelter for all I care!

354
00:48:36,963 --> 00:48:38,863
That's it.

355
00:48:39,566 --> 00:48:41,898
We'll live here.

356
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:48,767
No one uses it. It's sturdy.
We can live like we want!

357
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:52,038
Can we really live here?!

358
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:19,635
We've bothered you long enough.
We're leaving now.

359
00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:22,105
Leaving...? For where?

360
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:24,904
Haven't really decided yet.

361
00:49:26,846 --> 00:49:30,247
Well, take care of yourselves.
Bye-bye, Setsuko!

362
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:53,533
This'll be the kitchen!

363
00:49:55,442 --> 00:49:57,910
This'll be the front door!

364
00:49:59,713 --> 00:50:02,409
Where's the bathroom?

365
00:50:03,717 --> 00:50:07,778
That can be anywhere.
Wanna go somewhere with me?

366
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,729
Thanks for the wagon.

367
00:50:18,832 --> 00:50:21,130
Just leave it there.

368
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:27,668
Do you think you can sell us
some food and straw?

369
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:31,674
I guess.
Not much left, though.

370
00:51:26,466 --> 00:51:29,492
- My mouth's watering!
- Man, am I hungry.

371
00:51:56,129 --> 00:51:58,427
Well, we can always eat frogs.

372
00:51:58,531 --> 00:52:00,328
Frogs?

373
00:52:00,433 --> 00:52:02,765
They're great.

374
00:52:05,805 --> 00:52:08,171
You'd better get
under the mosquito net.

375
00:52:18,451 --> 00:52:19,748
What's wrong?

376
00:52:19,853 --> 00:52:21,718
I forgot my toothbrush.

377
00:52:21,821 --> 00:52:24,790
One night without it
won't matter.

378
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:31,728
It's getting buggy.
You'd better get under the net.

379
00:52:31,831 --> 00:52:34,800
It's dark in there. I'm scared.

380
00:52:39,105 --> 00:52:42,199
I have to take a leak.
How about you?

381
00:52:47,347 --> 00:52:49,315
A kamikaze.

382
00:52:49,983 --> 00:52:51,883
It looks like a firefly.

383
00:52:51,985 --> 00:52:53,953
Yeah.

384
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,752
Let's catch some.

385
00:52:58,424 --> 00:53:00,392
Okay, get in.

386
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,067
I can see you!

387
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:17,767
I can see you, too.

388
00:53:21,481 --> 00:53:23,073
A hair clip.

389
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,051
Okay, let's get
as many as we can!

390
00:54:24,911 --> 00:54:29,143
I went to a naval review once.
Before you were born.

391
00:54:29,248 --> 00:54:31,079
Naval review...?

392
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:36,645
Uh-huh. Dad's cruiser, the "Maya,"
was in formation with the fleet.

393
00:55:13,493 --> 00:55:17,623
Mighty fortresses
floating on the seas

394
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:21,689
Defending our homeland
from invaders near and far

395
00:55:21,801 --> 00:55:23,769
Enemy plane!

396
00:55:34,313 --> 00:55:38,374
I wonder
where Dad is fighting now.

397
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:09,744
Get off me, Seita!

398
00:56:47,854 --> 00:56:48,821
Whatcha doing?

399
00:56:48,921 --> 00:56:53,756
Making a grave.
Mama's in a grave too.

400
00:56:59,132 --> 00:57:02,033
Auntie told me.

401
00:57:02,135 --> 00:57:07,334
She said Mama died,
and she's in a grave now.

402
00:57:37,637 --> 00:57:39,798
We'll visit her grave sometime.

403
00:57:39,906 --> 00:57:45,139
Do you remember the graveyard,
the one near Nunobiki?

404
00:57:45,244 --> 00:57:50,773
That's where she is.
Under a big camphor tree.

405
00:57:50,883 --> 00:57:55,013
Why do fireflies
have to die so soon?

406
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:35,783
Hey, it looks like
somebody's living here.

407
00:58:35,895 --> 00:58:37,624
Probably lost their house.

408
00:58:38,297 --> 00:58:40,765
Maybe it's some crazy hermit.

409
00:58:41,334 --> 00:58:43,495
It's a swing.

410
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,434
A kid lives here.
What's this?

411
00:58:46,405 --> 00:58:48,566
Rest in Peace!

412
00:58:50,743 --> 00:58:53,268
Wish it was real food.

413
00:58:54,413 --> 00:58:56,472
It says "Setsuko."

414
00:58:56,582 --> 00:58:58,777
Look! Dried frogs!

415
00:58:58,885 --> 00:59:00,978
Who'd wanna eat that?!

416
00:59:01,087 --> 00:59:05,547
Nobody I know
would ever eat this stuff!

417
00:59:07,393 --> 00:59:08,883
Ground soybeans!

418
00:59:08,995 --> 00:59:11,327
And I thought
the food I got was bad!

419
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,728
A ghost!

420
00:59:25,578 --> 00:59:29,537
I've traded everything for rice.
Even my mom's kimono.

421
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,549
There's nothing left to trade.

422
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,916
Please, I can pay you money
for the rice.

423
00:59:35,588 --> 00:59:38,989
Sorry. I can't trade
or sell anything to you.

424
00:59:39,091 --> 00:59:43,425
I'm a farmer, but even
I don't have any rice to share.

425
00:59:50,736 --> 00:59:52,829
Don't you have other relatives?

426
00:59:52,939 --> 00:59:54,634
I can't contact them.

427
00:59:54,974 --> 00:59:58,933
Then take my advice
and go back to that woman.

428
00:59:59,211 --> 01:00:02,305
Everything's rationed now.

429
01:00:02,415 --> 01:00:05,248
You can't survive
outside of the system.

430
01:00:05,918 --> 01:00:08,887
Just swallow your pride
and apologize to her.

431
01:00:15,061 --> 01:00:18,394
Thanks, anyway.
I'll ask someone else.

432
01:00:19,765 --> 01:00:23,667
You're a navy man's son, right?
Try to be brave.

433
01:00:55,601 --> 01:00:57,569
Should we?

434
01:01:36,842 --> 01:01:38,810
Uh-oh!

435
01:02:39,071 --> 01:02:42,006
It doesn't matter
if you like it or not.

436
01:02:42,108 --> 01:02:43,075
You have to eat!

437
01:02:43,175 --> 01:02:45,507
You need to,
so you can grow up!

438
01:02:45,778 --> 01:02:47,040
Seita...

439
01:02:49,281 --> 01:02:53,718
I-I feel funny.

440
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:56,151
Are you cold?

441
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:59,691
I've been having diarrhea.

442
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,220
Why you...!

443
01:03:05,733 --> 01:03:07,428
I'm sorry!

444
01:03:08,168 --> 01:03:11,069
Sir, forgive me!
I didn't mean to.

445
01:03:11,905 --> 01:03:15,636
My sister's sick. I just wanted
to get her some sugar!

446
01:03:15,743 --> 01:03:20,203
Yeah, sure! Stealing food's
a serious crime in wartime!

447
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:24,540
You god damned...!
Come back here!

448
01:03:36,196 --> 01:03:38,960
What the hell...?!
Potatoes too?!

449
01:03:39,867 --> 01:03:42,836
So YOU'RE the one who's
been stealing around here!

450
01:03:42,936 --> 01:03:44,904
Seita!

451
01:03:45,272 --> 01:03:49,333
I'm sorry!
I'll never do it again, I swear!

452
01:03:49,443 --> 01:03:52,776
Tell it to the cops!
I'll take you there myself!

453
01:03:52,314 --> 01:03:54,544
Now walk!
I hope they lock you up!

454
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:58,780
Please, she's sick!
She needs me!

455
01:04:00,387 --> 01:04:03,515
Seita!

456
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:05,850
SEITA!

457
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:10,863
Seita...

458
01:04:16,236 --> 01:04:20,036
The nature of the crime is
fairly clear, I think.

459
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:23,507
Thank you, I'll handle this.
You may go.

460
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,908
But, officer...

461
01:04:26,346 --> 01:04:29,838
You've knocked
this poor kid around enough.

462
01:04:30,551 --> 01:04:32,985
I'm even tempted to call it...

463
01:04:33,587 --> 01:04:34,554
ASSAULT!

464
01:04:35,522 --> 01:04:37,615
I... er... Thank you, officer!

465
01:04:41,361 --> 01:04:44,489
They hit Fukui tonight.

466
01:04:47,201 --> 01:04:49,931
Would you like a glass of water?

467
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,547
Setsuko.

468
01:05:09,323 --> 01:05:10,790
Seita!

469
01:05:27,307 --> 01:05:28,968
Seita.

470
01:05:35,616 --> 01:05:41,452
Where does it hurt?
Should I get a doctor?

471
01:05:47,261 --> 01:05:48,728
Setsuko!

472
01:05:57,004 --> 01:05:59,973
Seita, I have to
go to the bathroom.

473
01:06:03,443 --> 01:06:05,741
Can it wait?

474
01:06:06,513 --> 01:06:08,481
Hop on.

475
01:06:16,156 --> 01:06:22,095
Brother's gone to the mountain
to bring back some firewood...

476
01:07:11,511 --> 01:07:13,479
Setsuko. Dinner.

477
01:07:17,217 --> 01:07:21,916
This pumpkin's great.
Tastes just like sweet bean jelly.

478
01:07:22,022 --> 01:07:24,547
Don't like that stuff.

479
01:07:24,658 --> 01:07:29,755
Look, if you don't eat,
Dad'll blame ME for it.

480
01:07:29,863 --> 01:07:33,822
Come on, I'll even help you.
Now cheer up and eat!

481
01:07:35,836 --> 01:07:40,330
Once you get better,
I'll take you to the beach again.

482
01:09:16,269 --> 01:09:18,931
Now I'll really get you
something good to eat, Setsuko!

483
01:09:28,515 --> 01:09:29,982
Seita...

484
01:09:36,356 --> 01:09:37,823
Seita...

485
01:09:40,227 --> 01:09:42,627
These were your mother's?
Don't make me laugh!

486
01:09:42,729 --> 01:09:47,428
Don't try to pawn off
this garbage on me!

487
01:09:56,743 --> 01:10:00,304
Setsuko.

488
01:10:27,607 --> 01:10:29,199
Setsuko!

489
01:10:36,616 --> 01:10:39,744
Seita... Water...

490
01:10:50,397 --> 01:10:51,659
Breathe in.

491
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:54,258
And out.

492
01:10:56,470 --> 01:11:00,736
She's been having diarrhea
for a while now.

493
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:06,507
Prickly heat, rashes...
And salt water hurts her skin.

494
01:11:09,216 --> 01:11:13,744
Weakening from malnutrition.
Probably due to the diarrhea.

495
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:15,219
Next?

496
01:11:15,322 --> 01:11:17,222
Can you give her medicine?
A shot?

497
01:11:17,324 --> 01:11:19,588
Don't wanna shot.

498
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:22,753
Please, doctor, help her!

499
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:28,729
Medicine?
All this child needs is food.

500
01:11:28,835 --> 01:11:30,530
Food...

501
01:11:31,505 --> 01:11:32,995
What's wrong?

502
01:11:33,106 --> 01:11:35,506
Where do I GET food?!

503
01:12:24,024 --> 01:12:28,427
Boy, am I hungry.
What do you want to eat?

504
01:12:28,528 --> 01:12:34,125
Tempura, sashimi, jelly...

505
01:12:34,234 --> 01:12:35,428
Anything else?

506
01:12:35,535 --> 01:12:39,596
Ice cream. And also...

507
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,634
I want fruit drops.

508
01:12:42,742 --> 01:12:45,575
Drops? Okay!

509
01:12:49,249 --> 01:12:52,878
I'll withdraw the money and
buy you all the food you need.

510
01:12:52,986 --> 01:12:57,821
Don't want anything.
You can have it.

511
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:03,824
Don't go! Stay with me!
Don't leave me alone!

512
01:13:04,698 --> 01:13:07,531
Don't worry, Setsuko.

513
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:11,798
I'll buy you some good,
nourishing food.

514
01:13:12,339 --> 01:13:17,174
And I'll never leave you again.
Never, ever again.

515
01:13:19,346 --> 01:13:21,314
I promise.

516
01:13:42,736 --> 01:13:43,794
3000 yen.

517
01:13:43,903 --> 01:13:45,996
There's a typhoon coming?

518
01:13:46,106 --> 01:13:51,442
Great, we get our "divine wind"
AFTER we surrender. Figures...

519
01:13:51,544 --> 01:13:54,877
Surrender...?
We've lost the war?!

520
01:13:55,215 --> 01:13:57,513
Haven't you heard?

521
01:14:00,887 --> 01:14:04,152
Japan's lost?
The Great Japanese Empire?

522
01:14:04,257 --> 01:14:07,226
Yeah.
Surrendered unconditionally.

523
01:14:08,595 --> 01:14:10,290
What about the fleet?

524
01:14:10,397 --> 01:14:11,386
All gone.

525
01:14:11,498 --> 01:14:15,093
Sent to the bottom.
Not one left afloat.

526
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,463
WHAT?!

527
01:14:16,569 --> 01:14:20,903
Was my Dad's ship sunken, too?!
Is that why he hasn't written?!

528
01:14:21,007 --> 01:14:23,441
How should I know?

529
01:14:23,677 --> 01:14:25,668
Crazy kid.

530
01:14:29,849 --> 01:14:31,612
Damn him!

531
01:14:47,834 --> 01:14:50,359
I'm so hungry.

532
01:14:54,908 --> 01:14:56,466
Dad.

533
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:05,981
Now Dad's gone too.

534
01:15:07,654 --> 01:15:09,349
He's dead too.

535
01:15:11,157 --> 01:15:12,818
Dad...

536
01:15:55,568 --> 01:16:00,369
Sorry I'm so late.
I'll make you some rice.

537
01:16:01,207 --> 01:16:03,175
Up they go.

538
01:16:05,011 --> 01:16:07,377
And down again.

539
01:16:09,582 --> 01:16:12,107
Oh. Firefly's stopped.

540
01:16:12,218 --> 01:16:15,187
I bought us
some chicken and eggs.

541
01:16:17,424 --> 01:16:19,392
And also...

542
01:16:27,734 --> 01:16:30,202
Setsuko,
what's in your mouth?!

543
01:16:34,174 --> 01:16:37,075
This is a marble.
It isn't a drop!

544
01:16:39,612 --> 01:16:43,571
I brought you something
I know you like.

545
01:16:46,619 --> 01:16:49,520
Seita. Have one.

546
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:55,889
Setsuko. What's...?

547
01:16:56,496 --> 01:16:58,760
Rice balls.

548
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:03,029
I made them for you.

549
01:17:04,571 --> 01:17:07,369
Here. Have one.

550
01:17:12,111 --> 01:17:14,477
You don't want them...?

551
01:17:14,581 --> 01:17:15,878
Setsuko!

552
01:17:25,625 --> 01:17:29,584
Look, it's a watermelon.
I didn't steal it, either.

553
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:44,407
Here, eat it.

554
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:53,552
It's good...

555
01:17:57,657 --> 01:18:01,787
Hold on, I'll make you some
rice gruel with eggs.

556
01:18:09,035 --> 01:18:11,868
I'll leave the melon here for you.

557
01:18:12,906 --> 01:18:14,203
Okay?

558
01:18:15,141 --> 01:18:17,302
Seita.

559
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:20,611
Thank you.

560
01:18:44,437 --> 01:18:48,168
She never woke up.

561
01:19:40,259 --> 01:19:43,092
There.
Charcoal for the cremation.

562
01:19:43,563 --> 01:19:46,623
Since it's a child,
you should do it at a temple.

563
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:52,464
The body should be lightly dressed.
Use beanstalks for a good fire.

564
01:19:52,572 --> 01:19:55,541
Beautiful day,
in spite of it all.

565
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:05,173
It hasn't changed a bit.
It's good to be home!

566
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:11,982
Look!
The old phonograph.

567
01:20:16,029 --> 01:20:18,691
I've missed this view.

568
01:21:04,510 --> 01:21:06,671
Come back soon!

569
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:48,093
The next morning,
I put some of Setsuko's ashes into...

570
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,431
the candy tin,
and then climbed down the hill.

571
01:24:51,537 --> 01:24:54,506
I never went back to the shelter.

572
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,848
Seita...

573
01:25:19,966 --> 01:25:21,934
Time for bed. Okay?

574
01:28:41,111 --> 01:28:50,579
