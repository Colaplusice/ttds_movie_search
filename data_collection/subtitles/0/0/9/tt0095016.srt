1
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,926
You don't like flying, do you?

2
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,462
What gives you that idea?

3
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:09,269
You want to know the secret
to surviving air travel?

4
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,072
After you get where you're going,
take off your shoes and socks.

5
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:16,743
Then you walk around on the rug barefoot
and make fists with your toes.

6
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,147
Fists with your toes?

7
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,716
I know. It sounds crazy.

8
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,651
Trust me.
I've been doing it for nine years.

9
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,323
Yes, sir! Better than a shower
and a hot cup of coffee.

10
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,390
OK.

11
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,135
It's OK. I'm a cop.

12
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:48,408
Trust me.
I've been doing this for 11 years.

13
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,812
On behalf
of the captain and the crew,...

14
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,248
..l'd like to welcome you
to Los Angeles.

15
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,084
Have a very merry Christmas.

16
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:09,062
Flight247 to Tucson
now boarding at gate 14.

17
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:15,602
Flight 247 to Tucson
now boarding at gate 14.

18
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:31,718
How do you do?

19
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,699
Ladies and gentlemen,...

20
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,301
Ladies and gentlemen!

21
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,404
I want to congratulate
each and every one of you...

22
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,940
..for making this
one of the greatest years...

23
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,576
..in the history
of the Nakatomi Corporation.

24
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,316
On behalf of the Chief
Executive Officer, Mr Ozu,...

25
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,551
..and the Board of Directors,...

26
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,486
..we thank you one and all...

27
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,856
..and wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year!

28
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:12,426
Happy New Year!

29
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,530
Hey, Holly.
What about dinner tonight?

30
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:19,299
Harry, it's Christmas Eve.

31
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,436
Families, stockings,...

32
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,839
Chestnuts?

33
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,741
Rudolph and Frosty?

34
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,843
Any of these things ring a bell?

35
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,578
Actually, I was thinking more of...

36
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:35,249
..mulled wine, a nice aged Brie...

37
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:39,453
..and a roaring fireplace.
You know what I'm saying?

38
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,892
Ginny, it's 5.40. Go join the party.
Have some champagne.

39
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,427
You're making me feel
like Ebenezer Scrooge.

40
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:51,231
Thanks. Do you think the baby
can handle a little sip?

41
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,401
That baby's ready to tend bar.

42
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:55,869
Last chance.

43
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,804
Bye.

44
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,747
McClane residence.
Lucy McClane speaking.

45
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:10,817
Hello, Lucy McClane.
This is your mother speaking.

46
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,720
Mommy!
When are you coming home?

47
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:15,956
Pretty soon.

48
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,392
You'll be in bed
when I get there, though.

49
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,961
Let me talk to Paulina, OK, hon?

50
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:25,399
And no snooping around the house
looking for presents.

51
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,935
Is Daddy coming home with you?

52
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,572
Well, we'll see what...

53
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,141
..Santa and Mommy can do, OK?

54
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,777
Put Paulina on. Bye, honey.

55
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,378
Paulina!

56
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,385
Hola, Mrs Holly.

57
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,121
Um, did Mr McClane call?

58
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:50,791
No, Mrs Holly. No telefono.

59
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,162
He probably didn't have time
before his flight.

60
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:58,031
It might be a good idea
to make up the spare bedroom...

61
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,166
..just in case.

62
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:02,236
Si, Mrs Holly. I do that already.

63
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,472
What would I do without you, Paulina?

64
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,032
California!

65
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,747
Hey, I'm John McClane.

66
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:47,881
Argyle.

67
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,850
I'm your limo driver.

68
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,188
Nice bear.

69
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,894
OK... Argyle.

70
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:02,763
What do we do now?

71
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,766
I was, uh, hoping you could tell me.

72
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,734
It's my first time driving a limo.

73
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,838
That's OK.
It's my first time riding in one.

74
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,674
We got everything in this mug, man.

75
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,343
Look at this... CD, CB, TV,...

76
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,580
..telephone, full bar, VHS.

77
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,883
If your friend's hot to trot,...

78
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,785
..l know a few mama bears
we can hook up with.

79
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,488
Or is he married?

80
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,123
He's married.

81
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,326
OK.

82
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,230
Sorry about that.
It's the girl's day off.

83
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,665
I didn't know
you were gonna sit up front.

84
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,234
Your lady live out here?

85
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,436
About the past six months.

86
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,539
Meaning you still live in New York?

87
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,510
You always ask
this many questions, Argyle?

88
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:53,113
Sorry. I used to drive a cab
and people would expect a little chitchat.

89
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,584
- So, you divorced?
- Just drive the car, man.

90
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:01,522
Hey, come on. You divorced?
You separated? She beat you up!?

91
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,529
She had a good job.
It turned into a great career.

92
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:13,800
- That meant she had to move here.
- You're very fast, Argyle.

93
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,270
So, why didn't you come?

94
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,074
Why didn't you come with her?

95
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,110
Because I'm a New York cop.

96
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:28,248
I got a backlog of New York scumbags
I'm still trying to put behind bars.

97
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,250
I can'tjust go that easy.

98
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,819
You thought she wasn't
gonna make it out here...

99
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,257
..and she'd come crawling back to you
so why bother to pack, right?

100
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,360
Like I said, you're very fast, Argyle.

101
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,995
Mind ifwe hear some tunes?

102
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,901
Hey, that'll work.

103
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,939
Don't you got any Christmas music?

104
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,741
This is Christmas music.

105
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,507
So your lady sees you,
you run into each other's arms,...

106
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:30,077
..the music comes up
and you live happily ever after, right?

107
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,045
I can live with that.

108
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:36,483
So, if it doesn't work out,
you got a place to stay?

109
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,151
I'll find a place.

110
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,254
I tell you what...

111
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:45,259
I'll wait in the parking garage. You score,
give me a call on the car phone.

112
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:50,230
I'll take your bags to the desk.
You strike out, I'll get you a hotel.

113
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,868
- You're all right, Argyle.
- Remember that when you sign for the tip.

114
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,460
- Hi.
- Good evening.

115
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,096
I'm here to see Holly McClane.

116
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:25,766
Just type it in there.

117
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,272
Cute toy.

118
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:35,742
Yeah, if you have to take a leak,
it'll even help you find your zipper.

119
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,461
Christ.

120
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,635
- Thirtieth floor?
- The party.

121
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,570
They're the only ones
left in the building.

122
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,105
Take the express elevator.

123
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,241
Get off where you hear the noise.

124
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,142
Thanks.

125
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,837
- Champagne, sir?
- Yeah, thanks.

126
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:46,173
Oh, I'm sorry.

127
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,243
Hey! Merry Christmas!

128
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,681
Jesus.

129
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,884
Fuckin' California!

130
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:59,153
I couldn't agree with you more.

131
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,388
Why don't I talk to him right now?

132
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:04,892
Hi. I'm looking for...

133
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,360
- Holly Gennero.
- Yeah.

134
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,395
Then you must be John McClane.

135
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:10,864
Joe Takagi.
How was your ride in?

136
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,433
Nice. I have you to thank for that?

137
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:15,736
Seemed the least we could do.

138
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:19,473
- Quite a place you have here.
- It will be ifwe ever get it finished.

139
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,575
Still several floors under construction.

140
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:26,079
Holly went to fax some documents.
She should be back any minute.

141
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,783
In the meanwhile,
her office is back here.

142
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,085
Ellis?

143
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:37,424
I was just making a call.
This was the nearest phone.

144
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,726
I want you to meet John McClane,...

145
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,395
..Holly's husband.

146
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,564
Holly's policeman.

147
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,933
Ellis is in charge
of international development.

148
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,535
Heard a lot about you.

149
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,404
You missed some.

150
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,674
Can I get you anything?

151
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:56,810
Food? Cake?
Some watered-down champagne?

152
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,979
No, thank you. I'm fine.

153
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,149
You throw quite a party.

154
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,553
I didn't realise they celebrated
Christmas in Japan.

155
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,754
We're flexible.

156
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,791
Pearl Harbor didn't work out,
so we got you with tape decks.

157
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,431
It's sort of a double celebration.
We closed a pretty big deal today...

158
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:20,000
..and a lot of it was due
to Holly. Right, Joe?

159
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,636
I'll be out
in a couple of minutes.

160
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,175
John.

161
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:34,281
Have you met everyone?

162
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:36,316
We've been sticking him with spears.

163
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,485
Of course he has.

164
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:42,589
She was made for the business.
Tough as nails.

165
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,025
I was hoping you made that flight.

166
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,294
Show him the watch.

167
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:48,829
Later.

168
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:51,031
Show him. Are you embarrassed?

169
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:54,134
It's just a small token of appreciation...

170
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,803
..for all her hard work. It's a Rolex.

171
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,373
I'm sure I'll see it later.

172
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:01,642
Is there a place
where I could wash up?

173
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:03,443
Sure.

174
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,894
You have to forgive Ellis.

175
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,563
He gets very depressed
this time ofyear.

176
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:27,334
He thought he was
God's greatest gift, you know?

177
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:29,703
I know the type.

178
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,573
I think he's got his eye on you.

179
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:36,677
That's OK. I have my eye
on his private bathroom.

180
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:39,913
Where are you staying?
Things happened so fast...

181
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,749
..l didn't get a chance
to ask you on the phone.

182
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,352
Cappy Roberts retired out here.

183
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:46,553
Oh, yeah?

184
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,255
He said I could bunk with him.

185
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,691
Cappy retired, huh?
Where's he live?

186
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,961
- Romona.
- Ha! Pomona.

187
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:56,663
- Huh?
- Pomona.

188
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,565
- Pomona.
- Yeah.

189
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:01,869
You'll be in the car halfthe time.

190
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,739
Why don't we make it easy?
I have a spare bedroom.

191
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,576
It's not huge or anything, but...

192
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:13,113
..the kids would love to have you
at the house.

193
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,849
They would, huh?

194
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:21,455
I would, too.

195
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:23,290
Ha ha! Ooh!

196
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,093
Sorry.

197
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,602
I missed you.

198
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,144
Didn't miss my name, though, huh?

199
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:48,148
Except maybe
when you're signing cheques?

200
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,317
Since when did you start using
Ms Gennero?

201
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,790
This is a Japanese company.
They figure a married woman's...

202
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,992
You are a married woman.

203
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,962
This conversation again?
We did this in July.

204
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,264
We never finished this conversation.

205
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,667
I had an opportunity. I had to take it.

206
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,603
No matter what it did to our marriage.

207
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,939
It only changed your idea
of our marriage.

208
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:13,807
You have no clue what my idea...

209
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:17,477
I know exactly what your idea
of our marriage should be.

210
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,313
Ms Gennero, l...

211
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:22,783
Excuse me.

212
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,651
Hi.

213
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:28,021
Um, Mr Takagi is looking for you.

214
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,657
He wants you to say something
to the troops.

215
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:31,525
Thank you.

216
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,064
Speech time.

217
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,000
Be back in a few minutes.

218
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:53,413
That was great, John.

219
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,517
Good job. Very mature.

220
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,434
So Kareem rebounds.

221
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:51,305
Feeds Worthy on the break,
over to AC, to Magic,...

222
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:52,606
..then back to Worthy.

223
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,876
Boom! Two points.

224
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:01,281
We're in.

225
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,032
Links...

226
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:36,069
..rechts...

227
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,938
..und wieder links.

228
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,070
Son of a bitch.

229
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:11,972
Ha ha!

230
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,409
Fists with your toes.

231
00:21:46,707 --> 00:21:48,041
Yeah, Argyle?

232
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,843
How's it going?

233
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,178
All right. Where are you?

234
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:54,248
Down at the garage.
What's with you and your lady?

235
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,617
The vote's not in yet.

236
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:07,828
- Hey, Bruder.
- Moment.

237
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:09,897
Nein! Nein! Nein!

238
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:29,516
Argyle?

239
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,219
Mac, you there? Hello?

240
00:22:40,828 --> 00:22:43,030
You know the number. Use it.

241
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:17,257
Stay calm.
Everything's going to be fine.

242
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,927
Everything's going to be fine.

243
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:40,747
Shit!

244
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:45,185
Think.

245
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,154
Think.

246
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:06,306
Ladies and gentlemen.

247
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:08,709
Ladies and gentlemen.

248
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:20,354
Due to the Nakatomi Corporation's
legacy of greed around the globe...

249
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,324
..they're about to be taught a lesson
in the real use of power.

250
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:27,961
You will be witnesses.

251
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:31,165
Now...

252
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:34,101
..where is Mr Takagi?

253
00:25:36,737 --> 00:25:40,107
Joseph Yashinobo Takagi,...

254
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:43,577
..born Kyoto, 1937...

255
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:49,716
Family emigrated to San Pedro,
California, 1939,...

256
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:55,689
..interned at Manzanar, 1942 to '43,...

257
00:25:57,024 --> 00:26:00,694
..scholarship student,
University of California,...

258
00:26:01,261 --> 00:26:03,096
..1955.

259
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:11,238
Law degree, Stanford, 1962.

260
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:15,075
MBA, Harvard, 1970.

261
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,946
President, Nakatomi Trading.

262
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:22,316
Vice Chairman,
Nakatomi lnvestment Group...

263
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:23,550
Enough.

264
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:26,753
And father...

265
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:28,188
..of five.

266
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:30,090
I am Takagi.

267
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:33,627
How do you do?

268
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,929
It's a pleasure to meet you.

269
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:51,345
OK, 32... construction,
33... computers.

270
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,293
Nice suit.

271
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:09,229
John Phillips, London.

272
00:27:11,598 --> 00:27:13,467
I have two myself.

273
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:17,137
Rumour has it
Arafat buys his there.

274
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:24,778
- This way?
- On the left.

275
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:50,704
And when Alexander saw
the breadth of his domain...

276
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:54,675
..he wept, for there were
no more worlds to conquer.

277
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,949
The benefits of a classical education.

278
00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:05,285
Ohh, that's beautiful.

279
00:28:07,888 --> 00:28:10,557
I always enjoyed to make models
when I was a boy.

280
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:15,395
The exactness, the attention
to every conceivable detail.

281
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,698
It's beautiful.

282
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:21,068
Is this what this is all about?
Our project in lndonesia?

283
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:24,972
Contrary to what you people may think,...

284
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:28,542
..we're going to develop
that region, not exploit it.

285
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:33,247
I believe you.
I read the article in Forbes.

286
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:36,683
Mr Takagi...

287
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:42,089
I could talk about industrialisation
and men's fashions all day...

288
00:28:42,189 --> 00:28:44,224
..but I'm afraid work must intrude...

289
00:28:44,324 --> 00:28:47,394
..and my associate here
has some questions for you.

290
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:51,265
Sort offill-in-the-blanks questions,
actually.

291
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:02,442
I don't have that code.

292
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,879
You broke in here
to access our computer?

293
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,182
Any information you could get...

294
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:10,450
..when they wake up in Tokyo,
they'll change it.

295
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:13,453
You won't be able to blackmail
our executives...

296
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:15,589
Sit... down!

297
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:29,136
Mr Takagi, I'm really not
interested in your computer.

298
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:35,843
But I need the code key...

299
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:40,948
..because I am interested
in the $640 million...

300
00:29:41,548 --> 00:29:45,853
..in negotiable bearer bonds
that you have locked in your vault...

301
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:49,590
..and the computer
controls the vault.

302
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,759
You want money?

303
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,596
What kind ofterrorists are you?

304
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:01,335
Who said we were terrorists?

305
00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:23,624
The bonds represent, at most...

306
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,494
..10 days' operating capital
for your parent organisation.

307
00:30:27,594 --> 00:30:30,898
It's really no more
than a temporary inconvenience.

308
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:32,032
Now...

309
00:30:36,436 --> 00:30:38,205
..the code, please.

310
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:40,507
It's useless to you.

311
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:44,044
There are seven safeguards on our vault
and the code key's only one of them.

312
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:45,512
You'll never get it open.

313
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:48,182
Then there's no reason
not to tell it to us.

314
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:52,986
- I told you.
- It's not over yet.

315
00:30:57,524 --> 00:31:01,195
It's a very nice suit, Mr Takagi.

316
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:05,165
It would be a shame to ruin it.

317
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,736
I'm going to count to three.

318
00:31:10,771 --> 00:31:13,740
There will not be a four.

319
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:16,510
Give me the code.

320
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:18,745
One,...

321
00:31:21,782 --> 00:31:23,083
..two,...

322
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:27,187
- ..three,...
- I don't know it.

323
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:30,124
Get on ajet to Tokyo
and ask the chairman.

324
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:31,792
You're just gonna have to kill me.

325
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:33,193
OK.

326
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:38,665
We do it the hard way.

327
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:40,734
Tony, see ifyou can dispose ofthat.

328
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:44,138
Karl, you better check on Heinrich's work
up on the machine floor.

329
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:45,572
[bumps head]

330
00:32:09,563 --> 00:32:10,531
Nothing.

331
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:13,066
See to Heinrich.

332
00:32:14,635 --> 00:32:16,069
Now...

333
00:32:16,537 --> 00:32:18,906
..you can break the code?

334
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,745
You didn't bring me
for my charming personality.

335
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:32,119
Argyle, tell me you heard the shots.

336
00:32:32,186 --> 00:32:33,787
You're calling the police right now.

337
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:36,190
Of course I'm still coming by later.

338
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:39,660
Sweetheart, have I ever lied to you?

339
00:32:40,494 --> 00:32:42,963
My boss? He thinks
I'm on my way to Vegas.

340
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:46,800
Uli, get up on the pipes.

341
00:32:47,568 --> 00:32:49,503
Marco, you go through here.

342
00:32:51,505 --> 00:32:53,140
I'll throw you the cord.

343
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:58,846
Hans, we're on the roof.

344
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:13,627
Here.

345
00:33:17,131 --> 00:33:18,365
Uli.

346
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:27,875
30 minutes to break the code,...

347
00:33:27,975 --> 00:33:32,546
..two hours, two and a half hours
for the five mechanicals, at the minimum.

348
00:33:32,646 --> 00:33:35,816
The 7th lock, however,
is out of my hands.

349
00:33:58,505 --> 00:33:59,873
I'm sorry?

350
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:02,843
The 7th lock...
the electromagnetic seal.

351
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,879
You do understand the circuits
cannot be cut locally?

352
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:08,916
Trust me.

353
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:13,821
Why the fuck
didn't you stop him, John?

354
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:17,724
'Cause then you'd be dead, too,
asshole.

355
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:19,827
Think, goddamn it! Think!

356
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:33,907
We've got a fire alarm.

357
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,210
Call 911.

358
00:34:36,276 --> 00:34:40,280
Give them the guard's name
and cancel the alarm.

359
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,648
Then disable the sys...

360
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:48,021
Eddie, on what floor
did the alarm go off?

361
00:34:49,556 --> 00:34:51,658
Shall we go?

362
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:53,193
Nein.

363
00:35:04,238 --> 00:35:05,405
Yes.

364
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:08,442
Hello, baby.
Come to Papa. Come on.

365
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:10,811
Ah ha ha ha!

366
00:35:12,346 --> 00:35:13,780
Come on, baby.

367
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:15,449
Come on, baby.

368
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:16,884
Come on, baby. Come to Papa.

369
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,419
I'll kiss your fuckin' Dalmatian.

370
00:35:22,222 --> 00:35:24,491
You stupid motherfuckers!
No! No!

371
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:27,060
Turn the fuckin' truck around!

372
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:03,564
The fire has been called off, my friend.

373
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:10,571
No-one is coming to help you.

374
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:17,811
You might as well come out
and join the others.

375
00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:22,583
I promise I won't hurt you.

376
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,249
Drop it, dickhead. It's the police.

377
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:57,084
You won't hurt me.

378
00:36:57,184 --> 00:36:58,952
Yeah? Why not?

379
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:00,921
Because you're a policeman.

380
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:03,423
There are rules for policemen.

381
00:37:03,524 --> 00:37:07,027
Yeah, that's what my captain
keeps telling me.

382
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:15,863
Bet your ass I wish to proceed.

383
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,138
Nine million terrorists in the world...

384
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:01,375
..and I got to kill one with feet
smaller than my sister.

385
00:39:50,757 --> 00:39:53,260
I wanted this to be professional,...

386
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,395
..efficient, adult, cooperative.

387
00:39:55,496 --> 00:39:56,597
Not a lot to ask.

388
00:39:56,697 --> 00:39:59,600
Alas, your Mr Takagi
did not see it that way...

389
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,370
..so he won't be joining us
for the rest of his life.

390
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:07,407
We can go any way you want it.

391
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:11,512
You can walk out of here
or be carried out...

392
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:15,616
..but have no illusions...
we are in charge.

393
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:20,988
So... decide now, each ofyou...

394
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:23,123
..and please remember...

395
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:26,727
..we have left nothing to chance.

396
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:32,533
It's Tony!

397
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:36,403
Get them back!

398
00:40:46,246 --> 00:40:48,715
Now lhave a machine gun.

399
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:53,620
Ho... ho... ho.

400
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,592
A security guard we missed?

401
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:03,764
They're usually tired old policemen.
No, this is something else.

402
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,576
We have to do something, Hans.

403
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:16,910
Yes, we do.

404
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:19,379
Tell Karl his brother is dead.

405
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:21,482
Tell him to come down.

406
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:24,985
Karl... komm sofort.

407
00:41:25,452 --> 00:41:27,855
Franco, Fritz,
take the body upstairs...

408
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:29,123
..and out of sight.

409
00:41:29,223 --> 00:41:31,992
I don't want the hostages
to think too much.

410
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:34,161
Komm sofort. Schnell.

411
00:42:36,356 --> 00:42:38,091
I want blood!

412
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:41,261
You'll have it, but let
Heinrich plant the detonators...

413
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:43,931
..and Theo prepare the vault.
After we call the police,...

414
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:47,234
..you can tear the building apart
looking for this man...

415
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:50,170
..but until then,
do not alter the plan!

416
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:52,840
And if he alters it?

417
00:42:57,611 --> 00:42:59,480
What do you think?

418
00:43:01,448 --> 00:43:03,584
Something's wrong.

419
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,018
Cops?

420
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,389
- John.
- John?

421
00:43:09,723 --> 00:43:11,859
He can fuck
this whole thing up.

422
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:13,227
What does he think he's doing?

423
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:14,561
His job.

424
00:43:14,628 --> 00:43:18,298
Bullshit.
His job's 3,000 miles away.

425
00:43:18,398 --> 00:43:21,635
Without him, we still have
a chance to get out of here.

426
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:25,205
Tell that to Takagi.

427
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:50,998
Mayday, Mayday,
anyone copying channel nine.

428
00:43:51,098 --> 00:43:53,600
Terrorists have seized
the Nakatomibuilding...

429
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:55,102
..and are holding
at least 30 people hostage.

430
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:57,304
I repeat.
Unknown number ofterrorists...

431
00:43:57,371 --> 00:43:59,473
..six or more
armed with automatic weapons...

432
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,707
..at Nakatomi Plaza,...

433
00:44:00,808 --> 00:44:01,809
..Century City.

434
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:04,778
Where's the best place to transmit?

435
00:44:04,845 --> 00:44:05,446
The roof!

436
00:44:05,512 --> 00:44:06,847
Go! Go!

437
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:12,085
It's the same address
as that fire signal.

438
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:14,655
I'll handle it.

439
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:17,858
Attention, whoever you are,...

440
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:20,494
..this channel is reserved
for emergency calls only.

441
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:23,664
No fucking shit, lady!
Do lsoundlike I'm ordering a pizza?

442
00:44:36,643 --> 00:44:39,413
No-one kills him but me.

443
00:44:40,047 --> 00:44:42,216
They have already killed one hostage.

444
00:44:42,316 --> 00:44:45,486
They are fortifying their positions
while you're jerkin' me off on the radio!

445
00:44:45,886 --> 00:44:47,855
Sir, I've already told you.

446
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:49,556
This is a reserved channel.

447
00:44:49,656 --> 00:44:53,393
If this is an emergency call,
dial 911 on your telephone.

448
00:44:53,494 --> 00:44:57,131
Otherwise, I'll report this
as an FCC violation.

449
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:59,766
Fine! Report me!
Come the fuck down here and arrest me!

450
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:01,135
Just send the police now!

451
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:18,218
See if a black and white can drive by.

452
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,032
Thought you guys just ate doughnuts.

453
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:35,435
- They're for my wife.
- Yeah.

454
00:45:37,438 --> 00:45:40,240
- She's pregnant.
- Yeah.

455
00:45:41,341 --> 00:45:42,242
Bag it.

456
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:45,078
Big time.

457
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:49,516
Thanks.

458
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:54,922
Dispatch to 8-Lincoln-30. Over.

459
00:45:54,988 --> 00:45:56,957
This is 8-Lincoln-30.

460
00:45:57,057 --> 00:46:01,361
Investigate a code two
at NakatomiPlaza, Century City.

461
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:05,399
8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.
I'm on my way.

462
00:48:03,584 --> 00:48:04,852
Girls.

463
00:48:20,534 --> 00:48:22,669
Shit! Where the fuck is it?

464
00:48:44,725 --> 00:48:46,627
Oh, my God.

465
00:49:02,543 --> 00:49:04,745
He's in the elevator shaft.

466
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,246
Perfect.

467
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:08,749
The elevators are locked off.
He can't escape.

468
00:49:08,816 --> 00:49:10,551
Just shut him in
and come back down.

469
00:49:14,455 --> 00:49:15,622
Oh, fuck.

470
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:23,897
Karl, the police are probably
on their way...

471
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:24,932
..already.

472
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:25,899
Karl?

473
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,155
Christ.

474
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,696
I can stall them,
but not ifthey hear gunshots.

475
00:49:55,796 --> 00:49:58,332
If you lock him in,
he'll be neutralised...

476
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:04,731
"Come out to the coast!"

477
00:51:04,832 --> 00:51:06,900
"We'll get together,
have a few laughs."

478
00:51:13,907 --> 00:51:16,944
Now I know
what a TV dinner feels like.

479
00:51:26,653 --> 00:51:28,455
Such!

480
00:52:24,378 --> 00:52:26,547
Karl, komm! Die polizei!

481
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,482
Karl, die polizei!

482
00:53:13,393 --> 00:53:15,362
Well, it's about time.

483
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,402
No signs of disturbance, Dispatch.

484
00:53:22,503 --> 00:53:24,938
Roger. Possible crank call.

485
00:53:25,038 --> 00:53:26,740
Check the area again and confirm.

486
00:53:33,313 --> 00:53:35,516
Who's driving this car,
Stevie Wonder?

487
00:53:37,751 --> 00:53:39,219
I do see a guard inside.

488
00:53:40,354 --> 00:53:42,189
I'm gonna go in for a closer look.

489
00:53:42,256 --> 00:53:43,624
Use caution.

490
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,861
Eddie?

491
00:53:48,362 --> 00:53:50,631
I had a feelin' you'd be calling.

492
00:54:14,188 --> 00:54:16,757
Evenin', officer.
What can I do for you?

493
00:54:28,202 --> 00:54:30,104
We had that false alarm.

494
00:54:30,204 --> 00:54:32,439
You ask me, that goddamn
computer sent you...

495
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:34,374
..on another wild-goose chase.

496
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:37,945
They been chasing bugs in this system
ever since they installed it.

497
00:54:38,011 --> 00:54:40,314
..Notre Dame on top ofUSC.

498
00:54:40,414 --> 00:54:42,149
Aw, shit!

499
00:54:42,249 --> 00:54:44,852
I got 50 bucks bet on them assholes.

500
00:54:46,553 --> 00:54:50,657
Come on, come on,
where's the fucking cavalry?

501
00:55:13,881 --> 00:55:16,483
..was goodfor52 yards.

502
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:18,685
Mind if I look around?

503
00:55:18,786 --> 00:55:20,154
Help yourself.

504
00:55:20,254 --> 00:55:22,956
27 seconds left in this first period.
Seven to nothing, Notre Dame.

505
00:55:23,023 --> 00:55:26,026
The lrish driving 74yards
in eightplays...

506
00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:29,663
I'll put this fuckin'...

507
00:55:30,164 --> 00:55:31,732
Freeze, motherfucker! Drop it!

508
00:55:31,832 --> 00:55:32,966
Don't shoot!

509
00:55:33,033 --> 00:55:35,836
- Put the gun down!
- OK! Don't shoot!

510
00:55:35,903 --> 00:55:37,070
Drop that fuckin' gun!

511
00:55:37,438 --> 00:55:38,672
Marco, down!

512
00:55:55,155 --> 00:55:57,257
Ah, to hell with this!

513
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,035
You are done!

514
00:56:08,102 --> 00:56:11,205
No more table!
Where are you going, pal?

515
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:13,841
Next time you have a chance
to kill someone,...

516
00:56:13,907 --> 00:56:15,542
..don't hesitate.

517
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:24,852
Thanks for the advice.

518
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:28,655
- Sorry to waste your time.
- No problem at all.

519
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:31,358
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

520
00:56:45,672 --> 00:56:47,508
Oh, for the love...

521
00:56:51,044 --> 00:56:52,780
8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.

522
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,947
Go ahead.

523
00:56:54,047 --> 00:56:56,517
A wild-goose chase
over here at Nakatomi Plaza.

524
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,552
Everything here's OK. Over.

525
00:57:07,294 --> 00:57:08,228
Shit!

526
00:57:08,328 --> 00:57:10,097
Goddamn it! Jesus H Christ!

527
00:57:18,138 --> 00:57:19,873
Welcome to the party, pal!

528
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,341
Goddamn it!

529
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:30,284
Get someone here now,
goddamn it!

530
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:32,920
Policeman under automatic
rifle fire at Nakatomi!

531
00:57:32,986 --> 00:57:35,022
I need backup assistance now!

532
00:57:36,356 --> 00:57:37,724
Now, goddamn it! Now!

533
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,212
Monica, I can get us a table.

534
00:57:59,379 --> 00:58:01,949
Wolfgang and I
are very close friends.

535
00:58:02,516 --> 00:58:04,151
I interviewed him, for God's sake.

536
00:58:04,218 --> 00:58:05,953
..Nakatomi.

537
00:58:06,019 --> 00:58:08,689
Repeat.
Officer needs assistance at...

538
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,190
I'm at Nakatomi Plaza.

539
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:12,493
They're turning my car
into Swiss cheese!

540
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:14,228
I need backup assistance now!

541
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:16,630
Now, goddamn it! Now!

542
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:39,520
Never thought
I'd love to hear that sound.

543
00:58:39,586 --> 00:58:41,188
All of you relax.

544
00:58:41,255 --> 00:58:44,191
This is a matter
of inconvenient timing, that's all.

545
00:58:44,258 --> 00:58:46,226
Police action was inevitable...

546
00:58:46,326 --> 00:58:49,029
..and, as it happens, necessary.

547
00:58:49,096 --> 00:58:52,566
So, let them fumble about outside
and stay calm.

548
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:54,268
This is simply the beginning.

549
00:58:55,969 --> 00:58:59,440
I told you all I wanted
radio silence until...

550
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,209
I'm very sorry, Hans.
I didn't get that message.

551
00:59:02,276 --> 00:59:05,679
Maybe you shouldhave putit
on the bulletin board.

552
00:59:05,746 --> 00:59:08,248
I figured since I waxed Tony
and Marco and his friend here,...

553
00:59:08,348 --> 00:59:11,185
..l figured you and Karl
and Franco might be lonely...

554
00:59:11,251 --> 00:59:13,220
..so I wanted to give you a call.

555
00:59:13,287 --> 00:59:15,522
How does he know
so much about us?

556
00:59:16,924 --> 00:59:19,059
That's very kind ofyou.

557
00:59:19,526 --> 00:59:22,529
I assume you are
our mysterious party crasher.

558
00:59:23,197 --> 00:59:24,565
You are most troublesome...

559
00:59:24,631 --> 00:59:26,433
..for a security guard.

560
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:29,703
Eeeh! Sorry, Hans. Wrong guess.

561
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:32,539
Would you like to go for doublejeopardy
where the scores can really change?

562
00:59:37,644 --> 00:59:40,047
Mm, these are very bad for you.

563
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:42,416
Who are you, then?

564
00:59:42,483 --> 00:59:44,785
Just the fly in the ointment, Hans.

565
00:59:44,885 --> 00:59:46,253
The monkey in the wrench,...

566
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,288
..the pain in the ass.

567
00:59:51,024 --> 00:59:51,859
Whoa!

568
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,929
Check on all the others.
Don't use the radio.

569
00:59:56,029 --> 00:59:57,397
See if he's lying about Marco...

570
00:59:57,464 --> 01:00:00,200
..and find out
if anyone else is missing.

571
01:00:03,804 --> 01:00:05,906
Mr Mystery Guest,...

572
01:00:06,974 --> 01:00:08,742
..are you still there?

573
01:00:09,476 --> 01:00:11,111
Yeah, I'm still here...

574
01:00:11,211 --> 01:00:13,947
..unless you want to open
the front door for me.

575
01:00:14,047 --> 01:00:15,949
No, I'm afraidnot...

576
01:00:16,049 --> 01:00:18,819
..but you have me at a loss.

577
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:20,654
You know my name, but who are you?

578
01:00:20,754 --> 01:00:24,925
Just another American
who saw too many movies as a child?

579
01:00:24,992 --> 01:00:28,162
Another orphan
of a bankrupt culture...

580
01:00:28,262 --> 01:00:31,365
..who thinks he's John Wayne,
Rambo, Marshal Dillon?

581
01:00:32,666 --> 01:00:35,602
I was always partial
to Roy Rogers, actually.

582
01:00:36,236 --> 01:00:37,971
I liked those sequined shirts.

583
01:00:38,071 --> 01:00:41,308
Do you really think you have
a chance against us, Mr Cowboy?

584
01:00:44,445 --> 01:00:46,547
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

585
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:52,653
I'll beat everyone if I get a remote.

586
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:54,521
Sam, I don't have the new pages.

587
01:00:54,621 --> 01:00:56,857
Harvey, keep your pants on.

588
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:58,692
Sam, I'm begging you.

589
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:01,995
Simon's with the remote.
I'll tell him to swing by.

590
01:01:02,096 --> 01:01:03,931
I won't sit on this!

591
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:06,800
This is my story!
I'm going out there!

592
01:01:06,867 --> 01:01:08,502
Look, Sam. Tell you what.

593
01:01:08,569 --> 01:01:10,804
You don't give me a truck,
I'll steal a truck.

594
01:01:10,871 --> 01:01:12,039
Give us a break, Thornburg.

595
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:13,307
Eat it, Harvey!

596
01:01:13,373 --> 01:01:15,976
..four, three, two,...

597
01:01:16,043 --> 01:01:17,277
..one.

598
01:01:17,478 --> 01:01:19,213
Harvey, we're on the air.

599
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:25,586
Good evening.
This is Harvey Johnson.

600
01:01:27,488 --> 01:01:29,189
And I'm Gail Wallens.

601
01:01:29,289 --> 01:01:31,291
This is Nightline News at 10.00.

602
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,161
Our top stories
on this Christmas Eve...

603
01:01:34,228 --> 01:01:37,397
Take truck number five.
Get out of here.

604
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:48,142
He wasn't lying about Marco.
He's down on the street.

605
01:01:48,709 --> 01:01:50,544
The other man was Heinrich...

606
01:01:51,078 --> 01:01:52,880
..and his bag is missing.

607
01:01:55,149 --> 01:01:56,617
He had the detonator.

608
01:02:01,622 --> 01:02:02,389
Theo.

609
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:04,224
Theo.

610
01:02:04,425 --> 01:02:05,492
Yo!

611
01:02:05,926 --> 01:02:09,096
We mayhave some problems.
How's ourschedule?

612
01:02:09,696 --> 01:02:11,098
Three down, four to go.

613
01:02:11,198 --> 01:02:12,633
Then don't waste time...

614
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:14,601
..talking to me.

615
01:02:15,335 --> 01:02:16,870
This is SergeantAIPowell...

616
01:02:16,937 --> 01:02:18,572
..of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

617
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:20,073
If the person who radioed for help...

618
01:02:20,174 --> 01:02:21,341
..can hearme on this channel,...

619
01:02:21,508 --> 01:02:23,410
..acknowledge this transmission.

620
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:24,545
I say again,...

621
01:02:24,611 --> 01:02:27,948
..if the person who radioed
for help can hear me,...

622
01:02:28,048 --> 01:02:30,517
..acknowledge this transmission!

623
01:02:34,788 --> 01:02:37,424
I read you, pal.
You the guy in the car?

624
01:02:37,524 --> 01:02:39,460
What's left of him.

625
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,228
Can you identify yourself?.

626
01:02:41,295 --> 01:02:42,996
Not now. Maybe later.

627
01:02:43,097 --> 01:02:45,099
Listen fast. This is a party line.

628
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:47,201
The neighbours got itchy trigger fingers.

629
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:48,802
All right, here's the deal.

630
01:02:48,902 --> 01:02:50,737
You got 30 or so hostages
on the 30th floor.

631
01:02:50,804 --> 01:02:52,239
The leader's name is Hans.

632
01:02:52,306 --> 01:02:53,807
We have to find him and shut him up.

633
01:02:53,907 --> 01:02:54,975
He's telling them everything!

634
01:02:55,075 --> 01:02:57,144
Let him. I'm waiting for the FBl.

635
01:02:57,244 --> 01:02:59,313
He can waste
as much time as he likes...

636
01:02:59,413 --> 01:03:01,682
..but we must find the bag, Fritz.

637
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:03,817
They have a freakin'arsenalhere.

638
01:03:03,917 --> 01:03:05,252
We must have the detonators.

639
01:03:05,319 --> 01:03:07,788
They got missiles, automatic weapons,...

640
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:09,990
..and enough plastic explosives
to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.

641
01:03:10,491 --> 01:03:13,327
They're down to nine now,
counting the skydiver you met.

642
01:03:13,427 --> 01:03:15,262
These guys are mostly European...

643
01:03:15,329 --> 01:03:17,831
..judging by their clothing labels and...

644
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,240
..cigarettes.

645
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:28,842
They're well-financed and very slick.

646
01:03:28,942 --> 01:03:30,611
How do you know that?

647
01:03:30,677 --> 01:03:32,446
I've seen enough phoney IDs in my time...

648
01:03:32,513 --> 01:03:36,350
..to recognise the ones they got
must have cost a fortune.

649
01:03:38,652 --> 01:03:41,054
Add all that up. I don't know
what the fuck it means...

650
01:03:41,155 --> 01:03:43,257
..but you got
some bad-ass perpetrators...

651
01:03:43,323 --> 01:03:44,725
..and they're here to stay.

652
01:03:46,326 --> 01:03:47,795
I hear you, partner.

653
01:03:47,861 --> 01:03:49,129
LA's finest are on it,...

654
01:03:49,329 --> 01:03:50,731
..so light 'em if you got 'em.

655
01:03:51,365 --> 01:03:54,168
Way ahead of you, partner.

656
01:03:54,701 --> 01:03:56,670
So what do I call you?

657
01:03:58,338 --> 01:03:59,473
Call me...

658
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:02,176
..Roy.

659
01:04:02,242 --> 01:04:06,013
Listen up, Roy,
if you think of anything else...

660
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,247
..don't be shy, OK?

661
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:10,384
In the meantime, find a safe place
and let us do our job.

662
01:04:11,385 --> 01:04:13,687
They're all yours, Al.

663
01:04:31,171 --> 01:04:32,473
Who's talking to 'em?

664
01:04:33,507 --> 01:04:36,543
I am, sir.
Sergeant Powell. AI Powell.

665
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:39,046
Dwayne Robinson. What's the deal?

666
01:04:39,113 --> 01:04:41,048
What do these pricks want?

667
01:04:41,115 --> 01:04:43,250
If you mean the terrorists,...

668
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:45,385
..we haven't heard a peep from them.

669
01:04:45,486 --> 01:04:47,354
Who have you been talking to?

670
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:51,258
We don't know.
He won't give us his name.

671
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:53,961
But he appears to be
the one who phoned.

672
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:57,297
He's killed one terrorist for sure
and claims he capped off two others.

673
01:04:57,397 --> 01:04:58,599
He claims?

674
01:04:58,699 --> 01:05:00,901
Powell, has it occurred to you...

675
01:05:00,968 --> 01:05:03,370
..he could be
one ofthe terrorists pulling your chain...

676
01:05:03,437 --> 01:05:05,205
..or some nutcase in there?

677
01:05:05,272 --> 01:05:08,375
I don't think so.
In fact, I think he's a cop,...

678
01:05:08,442 --> 01:05:11,245
..maybe not LAPD,
But he's definitely a badge.

679
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:14,581
- How do you know that?
- A hunch... things he said...

680
01:05:14,681 --> 01:05:17,451
..like being able to spot a phoney ID.

681
01:05:17,551 --> 01:05:19,620
Jesus Christ, Powell!

682
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,222
He could be a fucking bartender
for all we know!

683
01:05:22,289 --> 01:05:23,857
TV's here.

684
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:26,393
Oh, shit.

685
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:44,878
I have a request.

686
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:47,781
What idiot put you in charge?

687
01:05:47,881 --> 01:05:49,349
You did...

688
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:51,552
..when you murdered my boss.

689
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:53,720
Now everybody's looking to me.

690
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:56,356
Personally, I'd pass on the job.

691
01:05:56,457 --> 01:05:59,827
I don't enjoy being this close to you.

692
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:09,103
Go on.

693
01:06:09,203 --> 01:06:11,171
We have a pregnant woman.

694
01:06:11,271 --> 01:06:14,174
Relax. She's not due
for a couple weeks...

695
01:06:14,274 --> 01:06:17,444
..but sitting on that rock
isn't doing her back any good.

696
01:06:17,511 --> 01:06:20,914
So I'd like permission to move her
to an office with a sofa.

697
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:25,185
No, but I'll have a sofa
brought out. Good enough?

698
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:26,687
Good enough.

699
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:28,789
And unless you like it messy,...

700
01:06:28,856 --> 01:06:31,125
..start bringing us
in groups to the bathroom.

701
01:06:31,191 --> 01:06:34,294
Yes. You're right.

702
01:06:35,195 --> 01:06:36,864
It will be done.

703
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,766
Was there something else?

704
01:06:41,135 --> 01:06:42,703
No, thank you.

705
01:06:49,176 --> 01:06:52,012
Mr Takagi
chose his people well, Mrs...?

706
01:06:52,946 --> 01:06:53,947
Gennero.

707
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:58,252
Ms Gennero.

708
01:07:00,888 --> 01:07:03,524
We interrupt this programme
for a special news bulletin.

709
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:06,527
This is Richard Thornburg
live from Century City.

710
01:07:06,593 --> 01:07:09,696
Tonight, Los Angeles hasjoined

711
01:07:09,797 --> 01:07:12,833
the sadand worldwide
fraternity ofcities

712
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,902
whose only membership requirement

713
01:07:15,002 --> 01:07:18,071
is to suffer the anguish
of international terrorism.

714
01:07:18,172 --> 01:07:22,543
Approximately two hours ago,
an unidentified group of men

715
01:07:22,609 --> 01:07:25,279
seized control
of the Nakatomi building,

716
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:27,614
sealing off all entrances and exits.

717
01:07:27,714 --> 01:07:29,616
All telephone lines have been cut

718
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:32,019
and the only communication
now possible

719
01:07:32,086 --> 01:07:35,022
has been through the use
of CB communicators

720
01:07:35,089 --> 01:07:37,458
which the group
apparently brought with them.

721
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:39,359
According to official sources,

722
01:07:39,426 --> 01:07:42,062
the perpetrators of this building siege...

723
01:07:42,162 --> 01:07:44,898
Unit five,
hold your position in the main entrance.

724
01:07:44,998 --> 01:07:47,568
We got Charlie unit in position

725
01:07:47,634 --> 01:07:49,203
by the parking structure.

726
01:07:49,269 --> 01:07:51,071
Let me ask you something.

727
01:07:51,171 --> 01:07:53,307
Does this stairway
go up to the escalator?

728
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:54,575
Yeah.

729
01:07:54,641 --> 01:07:56,443
Tell them to go ahead.

730
01:07:57,177 --> 01:07:58,846
What's going on?

731
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,749
What's it look like? We're going in.

732
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:04,618
Going in? Man, that's crazy!

733
01:08:04,718 --> 01:08:06,653
There could be over 30 hostages
in there for all we know.

734
01:08:06,754 --> 01:08:08,655
We don't know shit, Powell.

735
01:08:08,756 --> 01:08:12,126
If there's hostages, how come
there were no ransom demands?

736
01:08:12,226 --> 01:08:15,496
If there's terrorists in there,
where's their list of demands?

737
01:08:15,596 --> 01:08:17,798
All we know is that
somebody shot your car up.

738
01:08:17,898 --> 01:08:20,033
It's probably the same silly son of a bitch

739
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,136
you've been talking to on that radio.

740
01:08:22,236 --> 01:08:23,904
Excuse me, sir,

741
01:08:23,971 --> 01:08:27,274
but what about the body
that fell out the window?

742
01:08:27,341 --> 01:08:29,143
Probably some stockbroker
got depressed.

743
01:08:29,243 --> 01:08:30,344
We're ready, Chief.

744
01:08:30,444 --> 01:08:32,813
- Light 'em up. Let's go.
- Hit your lights.

745
01:08:32,913 --> 01:08:35,816
- Blue units, go.
- Lights on!

746
01:08:47,761 --> 01:08:48,595
Powell?

747
01:08:50,097 --> 01:08:52,800
Powell, you still with me, babe?
What's going on?

748
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,802
Yo, Al.

749
01:08:54,935 --> 01:08:57,471
I'm here, Roy,
but I'm kind of busy right now.

750
01:08:57,538 --> 01:08:58,672
I'll talk to you later.

751
01:08:58,772 --> 01:08:59,706
Al, what's wrong?

752
01:08:59,807 --> 01:09:01,475
I'll talk to you later.

753
01:09:01,542 --> 01:09:03,610
If you are what I think you are,

754
01:09:03,677 --> 01:09:06,246
you'll know when to listen,
shut up, and

755
01:09:07,714 --> 01:09:09,683
and when to pray.

756
01:09:09,783 --> 01:09:11,985
Jesus Christ!
You're coming in, right?

757
01:09:12,086 --> 01:09:13,454
Christ, Powell,

758
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,556
I told you what kind of people
you're dealing with here.

759
01:09:15,656 --> 01:09:17,958
Let's load them up.

760
01:09:21,361 --> 01:09:23,831
They'll be coming.
Everyone get ready.

761
01:09:24,731 --> 01:09:27,367
Theo, you are the eyes now.

762
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:41,148
- Rivers.
- Yo.

763
01:09:41,215 --> 01:09:44,017
Begin your reconnoitre.

764
01:09:44,651 --> 01:09:46,019
Let's go.

765
01:09:49,223 --> 01:09:50,824
Shit!

766
01:10:09,743 --> 01:10:12,012
Come on. Let's go.

767
01:10:22,022 --> 01:10:23,724
Ow! Jesus!

768
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:00,227
All right, spread out.

769
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,688
Shut up.

770
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:31,391
Let's go.

771
01:11:36,029 --> 01:11:37,965
You macho assholes. No! No!

772
01:11:40,934 --> 01:11:43,704
Ahem... all right. Listen up, guys.

773
01:11:45,105 --> 01:11:47,274
'Twas the night before Christmas

774
01:11:47,341 --> 01:11:49,343
and all through the house

775
01:11:49,443 --> 01:11:51,879
not a creature was stirring, except

776
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:54,948
the four assholes
coming in the rear in standard

777
01:11:55,015 --> 01:11:56,817
two-by-two cover formation.

778
01:11:59,219 --> 01:12:00,521
We're all set.

779
01:12:01,889 --> 01:12:03,791
We're ready.

780
01:12:03,957 --> 01:12:05,292
Kick ass.

781
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:06,493
Go!

782
01:12:06,593 --> 01:12:08,729
Right. Let's do it.

783
01:12:24,211 --> 01:12:25,646
Take cover!

784
01:12:26,046 --> 01:12:27,548
They're shooting at 'em.

785
01:12:27,648 --> 01:12:29,683
It's panic fire.
They can't see anything.

786
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:31,652
They're shooting at the lights.

787
01:12:35,923 --> 01:12:39,493
They're going after the lights.
Call them back.

788
01:12:40,461 --> 01:12:41,862
It's not happening.

789
01:12:41,929 --> 01:12:43,163
Mike, burn it.

790
01:12:45,399 --> 01:12:47,101
Don't be impatient.

791
01:12:47,935 --> 01:12:49,737
Just wound them.

792
01:12:51,739 --> 01:12:54,274
Get them back.
They're sitting ducks without lights.

793
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:56,176
They're almost in.

794
01:12:56,243 --> 01:12:57,411
Send in the car.

795
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:59,113
Send in the car.

796
01:13:12,493 --> 01:13:13,861
Jesus Christ!

797
01:13:16,964 --> 01:13:19,733
Rivers, Rodriguez, report.

798
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:22,736
Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?

799
01:13:26,774 --> 01:13:29,443
The police have themselves an RV.

800
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:36,083
Southeast corner.

801
01:13:49,163 --> 01:13:51,064
Oh, Jesus Christ.

802
01:14:02,976 --> 01:14:05,712
Get back! Get the fuck back!

803
01:14:07,481 --> 01:14:08,615
Get over there.

804
01:14:08,715 --> 01:14:10,117
Schnell! Schnell!

805
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:12,319
Mach schnell!

806
01:14:15,189 --> 01:14:17,024
Weiter! Weiter! Weiter!

807
01:14:17,124 --> 01:14:18,992
Mach schnell! Mach schnell!

808
01:14:19,093 --> 01:14:20,260
Weiter!

809
01:14:23,263 --> 01:14:24,798
Mach los! Mach los!

810
01:14:44,818 --> 01:14:45,786
I see him!

811
01:14:57,398 --> 01:14:59,066
- Fire!
- Clear!

812
01:15:05,072 --> 01:15:08,075
Oh, my God!
The quarterback is toast!

813
01:15:08,675 --> 01:15:11,245
Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.

814
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:13,480
Hit it again.

815
01:15:13,547 --> 01:15:15,883
All right, you motherfucker,
you made your point!

816
01:15:15,983 --> 01:15:16,817
Let them pull back!

817
01:15:16,884 --> 01:15:19,386
Thank you, Mr Cowboy.
I'll take it under advisement.

818
01:15:19,486 --> 01:15:19,853
Hit it

819
01:15:19,953 --> 01:15:20,988
again.

820
01:15:35,235 --> 01:15:36,537
Fire.

821
01:15:51,085 --> 01:15:53,053
Fuck me.

822
01:15:53,153 --> 01:15:55,689
Get them out of the car! They're burning!

823
01:16:05,933 --> 01:16:06,567
Fuck it.

824
01:16:09,436 --> 01:16:11,105
Mach schnell! Mach los!

825
01:16:19,012 --> 01:16:22,616
Let's see you take this
under advisement, jerkweed.

826
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,322
Geronimo, motherfucker.

827
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,041
Oh, shit!

828
01:16:53,313 --> 01:16:54,915
They're using artillery on us!

829
01:16:54,982 --> 01:16:57,084
You idiot, it's not the police.

830
01:16:57,651 --> 01:16:59,353
It's him.

831
01:17:06,894 --> 01:17:08,162
Holy shit.

832
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,968
My God!

833
01:17:17,137 --> 01:17:20,107
- Tell me you got that.
- I got it.

834
01:17:21,475 --> 01:17:23,944
Eat your heart out, Channel Five.

835
01:17:24,011 --> 01:17:25,345
We've had an update

836
01:17:25,446 --> 01:17:27,981
on the terrorist take over
of the Nakatomi building.

837
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:30,250
Sources say
the terroristleader, Hans,

838
01:17:30,317 --> 01:17:32,352
may be this man... Hans Gruber.

839
01:17:32,453 --> 01:17:35,355
A member ofthe radical
West German Volksfreimovement.

840
01:17:35,456 --> 01:17:39,259
Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership
issued a communiqu an hour ago

841
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:42,129
stating that Gruber had been
expelled from that organisation.

842
01:17:42,196 --> 01:17:44,298
Al, do you copy?

843
01:17:44,665 --> 01:17:46,100
Are you all right?

844
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,368
Yeah, I'm fine.

845
01:17:49,503 --> 01:17:50,838
W-what was that?

846
01:17:50,904 --> 01:17:53,841
Remember that plastic
explosive I told you about?

847
01:17:53,907 --> 01:17:56,844
There you go.
Is the building on fire?

848
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:58,712
No, but it's gonna need a paint job

849
01:17:58,812 --> 01:18:00,414
and a shitload of screen doors.

850
01:18:00,514 --> 01:18:03,283
Our spotter said you got two
with that blast.

851
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:05,886
- Is that him?
- Yes, sir.

852
01:18:07,521 --> 01:18:10,190
I don't know who you think you are

853
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:12,726
but you just destroyed a building.

854
01:18:12,826 --> 01:18:15,896
We do not want your help.
Is that clear?

855
01:18:15,996 --> 01:18:17,831
We don't want your help.

856
01:18:17,898 --> 01:18:21,001
I've got 100 people down here,
and they're covered with glass.

857
01:18:21,068 --> 01:18:24,004
Glass? Who gives a shit about glass?

858
01:18:24,071 --> 01:18:25,038
Who the fuck is this?

859
01:18:26,673 --> 01:18:29,343
This is Deputy Chief of Police
Dwayne T Robinson

860
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:31,378
and I am in charge of this situation.

861
01:18:31,445 --> 01:18:33,247
Oh, you're in charge?

862
01:18:33,347 --> 01:18:35,349
I got some bad news for you, Dwayne.

863
01:18:35,416 --> 01:18:38,719
From up here it doesn'tlook
like you're in charge ofshit.

864
01:18:38,786 --> 01:18:40,888
Listen to me, you little asshole...

865
01:18:40,954 --> 01:18:41,789
Asshole?

866
01:18:41,889 --> 01:18:43,690
I'm not the one
who just got butt fucked

867
01:18:43,757 --> 01:18:45,592
on national TV, Dwayne.

868
01:18:45,692 --> 01:18:46,927
Ah ha ha!

869
01:18:47,027 --> 01:18:48,862
Listen to me,jerk-off,

870
01:18:48,929 --> 01:18:51,932
if you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.

871
01:18:52,032 --> 01:18:55,169
Quit being part of the problem
and put the other guy back on!

872
01:18:57,971 --> 01:18:59,706
Hey, Roy, how you feeling?

873
01:18:59,773 --> 01:19:01,775
Pretty fucking unappreciated, Al.

874
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:04,111
Hey, look. I love you.

875
01:19:04,211 --> 01:19:06,513
So do a lot of the otherguys.

876
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:09,183
So hang in there, man, you hear me?

877
01:19:09,249 --> 01:19:11,185
You hang in there.

878
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:15,222
Yeah, thanks, partner.

879
01:19:21,128 --> 01:19:22,529
What are you doing?

880
01:19:22,596 --> 01:19:23,831
I'm tired of sitting here

881
01:19:23,931 --> 01:19:25,999
waiting to see
who gets us killed first,

882
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,568
them or your husband.

883
01:19:28,068 --> 01:19:29,636
What are you going to do?

884
01:19:29,737 --> 01:19:30,571
Hey, babe,

885
01:19:30,637 --> 01:19:32,539
I negotiate million-dollar deals
for breakfast.

886
01:19:32,606 --> 01:19:34,475
I think I can handle this Eurotrash.

887
01:19:35,242 --> 01:19:38,112
Hey, sprechen sie talk, huh?

888
01:19:38,212 --> 01:19:41,081
If you'd listened to me,
he would be neutralised already.

889
01:19:41,148 --> 01:19:42,850
I don't want neutral. I want dead.

890
01:19:44,284 --> 01:19:46,220
Hope I'm not interrupting.

891
01:19:46,286 --> 01:19:47,321
What does he want?

892
01:19:47,421 --> 01:19:51,091
It's not what I want.
It's what I can give you.

893
01:19:58,499 --> 01:20:00,834
Look, let's be straight, OK?

894
01:20:00,934 --> 01:20:03,470
It's obvious you're not
some dumb schmuck

895
01:20:03,570 --> 01:20:05,572
up here to snatch a few purses.

896
01:20:05,639 --> 01:20:07,274
You're very perceptive.

897
01:20:07,341 --> 01:20:09,009
I watch 60 Minutes.

898
01:20:09,109 --> 01:20:11,812
I say to myself,
these guys are professional,

899
01:20:11,879 --> 01:20:14,314
they're motivated, they're happening,

900
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:15,983
they want something.

901
01:20:16,049 --> 01:20:18,886
I couldn't care less
about your politics.

902
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:21,188
Maybe you're pissed off
at the camel jockeys.

903
01:20:21,288 --> 01:20:22,723
Maybe it's the Hebes,
Northern lreland.

904
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:24,191
It's none of my business.

905
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:26,627
I figure you're here
to negotiate, am I right?

906
01:20:26,693 --> 01:20:27,828
You're amazing.

907
01:20:27,895 --> 01:20:30,230
You figured this all out already?

908
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:32,466
Hey, business is business.

909
01:20:32,533 --> 01:20:34,468
You use a gun,
I use a fountain pen.

910
01:20:34,535 --> 01:20:35,803
What's the difference?

911
01:20:35,869 --> 01:20:36,970
Let's put it in my terms.

912
01:20:37,037 --> 01:20:38,472
You're here on a hostile takeover.

913
01:20:38,539 --> 01:20:39,740
You grab us for some green

914
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,143
but you didn't expect some poison pill
was gonna be running around the building.

915
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:44,078
Am I right?

916
01:20:44,678 --> 01:20:45,712
Hans,

917
01:20:46,313 --> 01:20:47,381
bubbie...

918
01:20:47,881 --> 01:20:49,650
I'm your white knight.

919
01:20:50,751 --> 01:20:53,454
I must have missed 60 Minutes.

920
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,555
What are you saying?

921
01:20:56,990 --> 01:21:00,194
The guy upstairs
who's fucking things up, huh?

922
01:21:04,565 --> 01:21:06,533
I can give him to you.

923
01:21:09,203 --> 01:21:11,271
Oh, God...

924
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:15,743
Roy? Roy, you all right?

925
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:20,047
Just trying to fire down
a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.

926
01:21:21,048 --> 01:21:22,549
What do they put in these things,

927
01:21:22,649 --> 01:21:23,484
anyway?

928
01:21:24,017 --> 01:21:25,819
Sugar, enriched flour,

929
01:21:25,886 --> 01:21:27,921
partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil,

930
01:21:28,021 --> 01:21:29,423
polysorbate 60,

931
01:21:29,523 --> 01:21:31,225
and yellow dye number five.

932
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:34,261
Just everything
a growing boyneeds.

933
01:21:34,862 --> 01:21:36,730
How many kids you got, Al?

934
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:40,868
As a matter of fact,
my wife is working on our first.

935
01:21:40,934 --> 01:21:42,569
How about you, cowboy?

936
01:21:42,669 --> 01:21:45,139
You got any kids
back on your ranch?

937
01:21:46,373 --> 01:21:47,574
Yeah.

938
01:21:48,142 --> 01:21:48,942
Two.

939
01:21:49,676 --> 01:21:51,412
Sure hope I can see them

940
01:21:51,512 --> 01:21:53,781
swinging on ajungle gym
with AI Jnr someday.

941
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,051
Well, now, that's a date

942
01:21:58,118 --> 01:22:00,254
but you bring the ice cream.

943
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:02,956
Touching, cowboy. Touching.

944
01:22:03,891 --> 01:22:05,159
Or shouldl call you

945
01:22:05,259 --> 01:22:07,394
Mr McClane?

946
01:22:08,729 --> 01:22:11,398
Mr Officer John McClane

947
01:22:11,465 --> 01:22:14,134
of the New York
Police Department?

948
01:22:15,736 --> 01:22:17,971
Get on the phone to Harry in New York.

949
01:22:18,072 --> 01:22:20,407
You better get a hold of somebody
at Dispatch.

950
01:22:20,474 --> 01:22:23,911
Sister Theresa called me
Mr McClane in the third grade.

951
01:22:23,977 --> 01:22:26,547
My friends call me John

952
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:29,416
and you're neither, shithead.

953
01:22:29,483 --> 01:22:33,187
I have someone
who wants to talk to you.

954
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:35,989
A very special friend

955
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:38,659
who was with you
at the party tonight.

956
01:22:44,631 --> 01:22:46,767
Hey, John boy.

957
01:22:48,035 --> 01:22:49,503
Ellis?

958
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:51,105
Yeah.

959
01:22:51,171 --> 01:22:55,142
Listen, John, they're giving me
a few minutes to talk sense into you.

960
01:22:55,209 --> 01:22:58,278
I know you think you're doing yourjob
and I can appreciate that

961
01:22:58,345 --> 01:23:00,047
but you'rejust dragging
this thing out.

962
01:23:00,147 --> 01:23:03,183
Look, no-one gets out of here
until these guys

963
01:23:03,283 --> 01:23:04,985
can talk to the LA Police.

964
01:23:05,052 --> 01:23:08,455
That won't happen until you stop
messing up the works. Capisce?

965
01:23:13,994 --> 01:23:15,763
Ellis, what have you told them?

966
01:23:15,829 --> 01:23:19,933
I told them we were old friends
and you were my guest

967
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,468
at the party.

968
01:23:22,503 --> 01:23:24,471
Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.

969
01:23:24,538 --> 01:23:25,806
Tell me about it.

970
01:23:32,413 --> 01:23:34,148
All right, John, listen.

971
01:23:34,214 --> 01:23:37,418
They want you to tell them
where the detonators are.

972
01:23:37,518 --> 01:23:39,787
They know people are listening.

973
01:23:39,853 --> 01:23:43,824
They want the detonators,
or they're gonna kill me.

974
01:23:47,361 --> 01:23:48,796
John, didn't you hear me?

975
01:23:51,231 --> 01:23:53,100
Yeah, I hear you.

976
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,069
John, get with the programme.

977
01:23:55,169 --> 01:23:57,738
The police are here now.
It's their problem.

978
01:23:57,838 --> 01:24:00,374
Tell these guys where the detonators are
so no-one else gets hurt!

979
01:24:00,441 --> 01:24:03,510
I'm putting my life
on the line for you, pal!

980
01:24:03,577 --> 01:24:05,813
Ellis, listen to me carefully.

981
01:24:05,879 --> 01:24:06,213
John...

982
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,282
Shut up, Ellis!
Just shut your mouth!

983
01:24:09,049 --> 01:24:10,451
Put Hans back on the line.

984
01:24:10,551 --> 01:24:15,155
Hans, this shithead doesn'tknow
what kind of man you are but l do.

985
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:17,224
Good. Then you'll
give us what we want

986
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:18,692
and save your friend's life.

987
01:24:18,759 --> 01:24:20,994
You're not part ofthis equation.

988
01:24:21,061 --> 01:24:23,363
Hey, what am l, a method actor?

989
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:25,032
Babe, putaway the gun.

990
01:24:25,099 --> 01:24:26,767
This is radio, not television.

991
01:24:26,867 --> 01:24:28,936
Hans, this asshole is not my friend!

992
01:24:29,036 --> 01:24:30,471
I just met him tonight!
I don't know him!

993
01:24:30,571 --> 01:24:32,606
Jesus Christ, Ellis!
These people will kill you!

994
01:24:32,706 --> 01:24:34,575
Tell them you don't know me!

995
01:24:35,709 --> 01:24:38,112
How can you say that
after all these years?

996
01:24:38,212 --> 01:24:41,749
John? John?

997
01:25:05,406 --> 01:25:06,507
Do you hear that?

998
01:25:07,307 --> 01:25:09,743
Talk to me!
Where are my detonators?

999
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:12,780
Where are they,
or shall I shoot another one?

1000
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,114
Sooner or later

1001
01:25:14,214 --> 01:25:16,784
I mightget to someone
you do care about.

1002
01:25:17,351 --> 01:25:19,953
Go fuck yourself, Hans.

1003
01:25:21,155 --> 01:25:23,257
He just let the guy die.

1004
01:25:23,323 --> 01:25:25,359
He just gave him up.
Give me that headset.

1005
01:25:25,459 --> 01:25:27,528
That's like pulling the trigger yourself.

1006
01:25:27,628 --> 01:25:31,298
Can't you see what's happening?
Can't you read between the lines?

1007
01:25:31,365 --> 01:25:33,667
He did everything he could
to save him.

1008
01:25:33,767 --> 01:25:36,870
If he gave himself up,
they'd both be dead right now!

1009
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:39,640
No way, man. They'd be talking to us.

1010
01:25:39,706 --> 01:25:43,243
You tell this partner of yours
to stay out of this from now on.

1011
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:46,346
Because if he doesn't,
I'm really going to nail his ass.

1012
01:25:46,447 --> 01:25:48,382
The man is hurting.

1013
01:25:48,482 --> 01:25:50,117
He is alone, tired,

1014
01:25:50,184 --> 01:25:53,854
and he hasn't seen diddly-squat
from anybody here!

1015
01:25:53,954 --> 01:25:56,457
You're gonna tell me he'll give a damn

1016
01:25:56,523 --> 01:25:59,693
about what you do to him
if he makes it out ofthere alive?

1017
01:25:59,793 --> 01:26:02,696
Why don't you wake up
and smell what you're shovelling?

1018
01:26:02,796 --> 01:26:04,364
You listen to me, sergeant.

1019
01:26:04,465 --> 01:26:07,968
Any time you want to go home,
you consider yourself dismissed.

1020
01:26:08,035 --> 01:26:11,371
No, sir.
You couldn't drag me away.

1021
01:26:11,472 --> 01:26:13,340
Attention, police.

1022
01:26:14,508 --> 01:26:16,577
Attention, police.

1023
01:26:16,677 --> 01:26:19,747
- This is Sergeant AI Powell...
- Give me that.

1024
01:26:20,114 --> 01:26:22,383
This is Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.

1025
01:26:22,483 --> 01:26:23,384
Who is this?

1026
01:26:23,484 --> 01:26:25,018
This is Hans Gruber.

1027
01:26:26,286 --> 01:26:29,757
I assume you realise the futility
of direct action against me.

1028
01:26:29,857 --> 01:26:31,759
We have no wish
for further loss of life.

1029
01:26:31,859 --> 01:26:34,895
What is it you do wish for?

1030
01:26:34,995 --> 01:26:39,233
I have comrades in arms
around the world languishing in prison.

1031
01:26:39,333 --> 01:26:43,036
The American State Department
enjoys rattling its sabre for its own ends.

1032
01:26:43,137 --> 01:26:45,172
Now it can rattle it for me.

1033
01:26:46,573 --> 01:26:50,210
The following people
are to be released from their captors.

1034
01:26:50,844 --> 01:26:53,947
In Northern lreland the seven members
of the New Provo Front.

1035
01:26:54,048 --> 01:26:58,685
In Canada, the five imprisonedleaders
ofLibert de Quebec.

1036
01:26:58,752 --> 01:27:02,723
In Sri Lanka, the nine members
of the Asian Dawn.

1037
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:04,324
What the fuck?

1038
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:06,226
Asian Dawn?

1039
01:27:06,326 --> 01:27:08,796
I read about them in Time magazine.

1040
01:27:08,896 --> 01:27:12,800
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,

1041
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:16,103
the hostages in this building
will be taken to the roof

1042
01:27:16,203 --> 01:27:18,539
and they will accompany us
in helicopters

1043
01:27:18,605 --> 01:27:20,874
to the Los Angeles
lnternational Airport

1044
01:27:20,941 --> 01:27:23,577
where they will be given
further instructions.

1045
01:27:23,644 --> 01:27:25,546
You have two hours to comply.

1046
01:27:25,612 --> 01:27:29,083
Wait a minute. Uh, Mr. Gruber.
This is crazy.

1047
01:27:29,183 --> 01:27:32,920
I don't have the authority.
Two hours is not enough.

1048
01:27:32,986 --> 01:27:35,289
Hello? Hello!

1049
01:27:37,391 --> 01:27:40,561
Did you get all that?
We got to make some calls.

1050
01:27:40,627 --> 01:27:42,763
Do you think they'll even try?

1051
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:44,565
Who cares?

1052
01:27:47,267 --> 01:27:49,436
Theo, are we on schedule?

1053
01:27:49,536 --> 01:27:51,472
One more to go, then it's up to you.

1054
01:27:51,572 --> 01:27:54,975
You better be right
because the last one will take a miracle.

1055
01:27:55,075 --> 01:27:56,610
It's Christmas, Theo.

1056
01:27:56,677 --> 01:27:59,246
It's the time of miracles,
so be of good cheer

1057
01:27:59,313 --> 01:28:02,116
and call me
when you hit the last lock.

1058
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:03,851
Karl,

1059
01:28:03,951 --> 01:28:07,621
hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.

1060
01:28:07,688 --> 01:28:09,823
Fritz is checking the explosives.

1061
01:28:09,923 --> 01:28:12,593
I'll check the explosives.
You just get the detonators.

1062
01:28:12,659 --> 01:28:14,995
Hey, Powell, you out there?

1063
01:28:15,095 --> 01:28:17,765
I'm here, John. I'm here.

1064
01:28:18,298 --> 01:28:21,802
You gotta believe me.
There was nothing I could do.

1065
01:28:21,869 --> 01:28:25,439
Well, it's gonna be
both our asses ifyou're wrong.

1066
01:28:25,973 --> 01:28:27,508
I hear you.

1067
01:28:33,447 --> 01:28:35,849
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

1068
01:28:35,949 --> 01:28:38,485
It doesn'tmake sense, man.

1069
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:41,155
Hey, don't ask me, man.

1070
01:28:41,221 --> 01:28:43,824
I'm just a deskjockey
who was on my way home when you rang.

1071
01:28:43,891 --> 01:28:47,528
The way you drove that car
I figured you for the street, Al.

1072
01:28:47,628 --> 01:28:50,597
In my youth. In my youth.

1073
01:28:50,664 --> 01:28:54,635
..author of "Hostage Terrorist,
Terrorist Hostage,

1074
01:28:54,701 --> 01:28:55,869
A Study in Duality. "

1075
01:28:55,969 --> 01:28:57,504
Dr Hasseldorf,

1076
01:28:57,604 --> 01:28:59,706
what can we expect
in the next few hours?

1077
01:28:59,807 --> 01:29:00,340
Well, Gail,

1078
01:29:00,441 --> 01:29:03,010
by this time,
the hostages should be going through

1079
01:29:03,077 --> 01:29:05,379
the early stages
of the Helsinki Syndrome.

1080
01:29:05,479 --> 01:29:07,314
As in Helsinki, Sweden.

1081
01:29:07,381 --> 01:29:08,982
Finland.

1082
01:29:09,049 --> 01:29:12,686
Basically, it's when the hostages
and the terrorists

1083
01:29:12,753 --> 01:29:15,389
go through a sort of
psychological transference

1084
01:29:15,489 --> 01:29:17,624
and a projection of dependency.

1085
01:29:17,691 --> 01:29:20,527
A strange sort oftrust
and bond develops.

1086
01:29:20,627 --> 01:29:23,197
We've hadsituations
where the hostages

1087
01:29:23,263 --> 01:29:25,632
have embraced their captors
after release

1088
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:28,035
and even corresponded with them
in prison.

1089
01:29:28,235 --> 01:29:31,038
No, no, darling. Asian Dawn. Dawn.

1090
01:29:31,105 --> 01:29:34,074
D-A-W-N.

1091
01:29:34,174 --> 01:29:35,642
- Sir?
- Yeah?

1092
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:37,644
Sir, the FBI is here.

1093
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:41,515
- The FBI is here now?
- Yes, sir. Right over there.

1094
01:29:41,582 --> 01:29:42,716
Hold this.

1095
01:29:43,016 --> 01:29:45,252
Want a breath mint?

1096
01:29:49,289 --> 01:29:51,225
Hey, how you doing, man?

1097
01:29:51,759 --> 01:29:54,395
I'm Agent Johnson.
This is Special Agent Johnson.

1098
01:29:54,495 --> 01:29:57,831
- Oh, how you doing?
- No relation.

1099
01:29:57,898 --> 01:29:59,233
I'm, uh...

1100
01:30:00,667 --> 01:30:03,604
I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.
I'm in charge here.

1101
01:30:04,571 --> 01:30:06,607
Not any more.

1102
01:31:01,328 --> 01:31:04,898
Hi, there. How you doing?

1103
01:31:08,202 --> 01:31:09,269
Ohh...

1104
01:31:10,838 --> 01:31:14,007
Please, God. No.
You're one ofthem, aren't you?

1105
01:31:14,108 --> 01:31:15,642
You're one ofthem.

1106
01:31:15,743 --> 01:31:18,612
No! Don't kill me! Please!

1107
01:31:18,679 --> 01:31:21,148
Don't kill me, please!
Please, please, please.

1108
01:31:21,215 --> 01:31:24,017
Whoa. Relax.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1109
01:31:24,118 --> 01:31:25,786
I'm not gonna hurt you!

1110
01:31:28,322 --> 01:31:29,957
Oh, God.

1111
01:31:33,394 --> 01:31:34,962
What the fuck
are you doing up here?

1112
01:31:35,028 --> 01:31:36,630
What were you looking for?

1113
01:31:36,697 --> 01:31:39,133
I managed to get out ofthere and

1114
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:42,336
I was just trying
to get up on the roof

1115
01:31:42,403 --> 01:31:45,139
and see if I could signal for help.

1116
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,776
It's just over here.
Why don't you come and help?

1117
01:31:48,842 --> 01:31:51,979
Hold it. Forget the roof.

1118
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:55,516
I said forget the roof.
They got people all over it.

1119
01:31:56,950 --> 01:31:59,353
You want to stay alive,
you stay with me.

1120
01:32:02,222 --> 01:32:04,258
The best we can figure it,

1121
01:32:04,358 --> 01:32:07,861
we've got maybe
30 or 35 hostages up there

1122
01:32:07,961 --> 01:32:09,863
probably on the 30th floor

1123
01:32:09,963 --> 01:32:13,567
and maybe seven or eight
terrorists up there.

1124
01:32:13,667 --> 01:32:15,836
Sounds like an A-7 scenario.

1125
01:32:15,903 --> 01:32:18,338
Thank you.
We'll handle it from here.

1126
01:32:18,405 --> 01:32:21,241
When we commandeer your men,
we'll try and let you know.

1127
01:32:21,341 --> 01:32:23,277
Aren't you forgetting something?

1128
01:32:23,377 --> 01:32:24,378
Such as?

1129
01:32:24,445 --> 01:32:26,146
What about John McClane?

1130
01:32:26,213 --> 01:32:29,349
He's the reason
we have any information.

1131
01:32:29,416 --> 01:32:33,053
He's also the reason
you're facing seven terrorists, not twelve.

1132
01:32:33,153 --> 01:32:35,456
He's inside? Who is he?

1133
01:32:35,556 --> 01:32:38,459
He might be a cop.
We're checking on that.

1134
01:32:38,559 --> 01:32:41,228
- One ofyours?
- No, no way.

1135
01:32:46,767 --> 01:32:47,634
You smoke?

1136
01:32:49,203 --> 01:32:50,704
Yeah.

1137
01:32:55,409 --> 01:32:56,610
Thanks.

1138
01:33:00,481 --> 01:33:03,384
You don't work for Nakatomi.

1139
01:33:07,654 --> 01:33:09,456
And ifyou're not one ofthem...

1140
01:33:12,626 --> 01:33:14,094
I'm a cop from New York.

1141
01:33:15,963 --> 01:33:17,564
New York?

1142
01:33:17,631 --> 01:33:18,732
Yeah.

1143
01:33:19,633 --> 01:33:22,469
Got invited to
the Christmas party by mistake.

1144
01:33:22,569 --> 01:33:23,871
Who knew?

1145
01:33:31,645 --> 01:33:34,048
Better than being caught
with your pants down, huh?

1146
01:33:43,824 --> 01:33:45,292
I'm John McClane.

1147
01:33:46,627 --> 01:33:48,128
You're, uh...

1148
01:33:49,496 --> 01:33:50,631
Clay.

1149
01:33:53,133 --> 01:33:54,468
Bill Clay.

1150
01:34:00,607 --> 01:34:02,676
Know how to use a handgun, Bill?

1151
01:34:04,111 --> 01:34:06,113
I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.

1152
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:08,449
That game with the guns
that shoot red paint.

1153
01:34:08,515 --> 01:34:10,784
Probably seems kind of stupid to you.

1154
01:34:12,186 --> 01:34:13,387
Nope.

1155
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:18,325
Time for the real thing, Bill.

1156
01:34:26,867 --> 01:34:29,136
All you got to do
is pull the trigger.

1157
01:34:29,837 --> 01:34:30,404
Come on.

1158
01:34:49,857 --> 01:34:51,358
Put down the gun

1159
01:34:51,425 --> 01:34:54,161
and give me my detonators.

1160
01:34:58,565 --> 01:35:00,000
Well, well, well...

1161
01:35:01,935 --> 01:35:03,003
Hans.

1162
01:35:04,038 --> 01:35:06,573
Put it down now.

1163
01:35:10,177 --> 01:35:12,846
That's pretty tricky
with that accent.

1164
01:35:12,913 --> 01:35:16,250
You oughta be on fucking TV
with that accent.

1165
01:35:19,253 --> 01:35:22,890
But what do you want
with the detonators?

1166
01:35:22,956 --> 01:35:25,626
I already used all the explosives.

1167
01:35:27,961 --> 01:35:29,329
Or did l?

1168
01:35:30,764 --> 01:35:32,399
I'm going to count to three.

1169
01:35:32,499 --> 01:35:34,902
Yeah. Like you did with Takagi?

1170
01:35:36,036 --> 01:35:36,704
Oops.

1171
01:35:38,605 --> 01:35:39,940
No bullets.

1172
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:43,110
What do you think...
I'm fucking stupid, Hans?

1173
01:35:43,210 --> 01:35:44,278
You were saying?

1174
01:36:38,966 --> 01:36:39,466
Karl.

1175
01:36:40,434 --> 01:36:41,635
SchieB dem Fenster.

1176
01:36:49,209 --> 01:36:51,145
Shoot the glass!

1177
01:37:24,511 --> 01:37:26,013
Jesus Christ!

1178
01:37:55,242 --> 01:37:58,212
Smile, Karl.
We're back in business.

1179
01:38:00,881 --> 01:38:03,884
..is the lastresort ofdiplomacy,

1180
01:38:03,951 --> 01:38:07,020
then couldn't wejustas well say

1181
01:38:07,087 --> 01:38:10,023
that terrorism has an equal claim
on being that, too?

1182
01:38:10,724 --> 01:38:12,860
Tell me you got something.

1183
01:38:12,926 --> 01:38:16,897
McClane's name, badge number,
employment record, vital statistics,

1184
01:38:16,964 --> 01:38:18,399
and his family's home address

1185
01:38:18,499 --> 01:38:20,434
right here in LA.

1186
01:38:22,870 --> 01:38:23,604
Whoo!

1187
01:38:29,209 --> 01:38:30,377
Go to work.

1188
01:38:30,577 --> 01:38:32,379
Got it.

1189
01:38:44,525 --> 01:38:47,761
God, that man looks really pissed.

1190
01:38:50,097 --> 01:38:52,099
He's still alive.

1191
01:38:52,466 --> 01:38:53,467
What?

1192
01:38:54,868 --> 01:38:58,806
Only John can drive
somebody that crazy.

1193
01:39:13,654 --> 01:39:16,724
Hans, you better heat up that miracle

1194
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:18,959
because we just broke through
on number six

1195
01:39:19,026 --> 01:39:21,762
and the electromagnetic
came down like a fucking anvil.

1196
01:39:21,829 --> 01:39:27,167
Have a look at what our friends
outside are doing and I'll be right up.

1197
01:39:29,603 --> 01:39:30,771
Hey, John.

1198
01:39:30,838 --> 01:39:33,273
John McClane, you still with us?

1199
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:34,475
Yeah.

1200
01:39:35,275 --> 01:39:39,113
But all things being equal,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

1201
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:41,815
Chalk up two more bad guys.

1202
01:39:42,149 --> 01:39:44,952
The boys down here
will be glad to hear that.

1203
01:39:45,819 --> 01:39:47,688
We gota poolgoing on you.

1204
01:39:47,788 --> 01:39:49,656
What kind of odds am I getting?

1205
01:39:49,757 --> 01:39:51,392
You don't want to know.

1206
01:39:51,492 --> 01:39:52,926
Put me down for 20.

1207
01:39:52,993 --> 01:39:54,161
I'm good for it.

1208
01:39:58,065 --> 01:40:00,768
Hey, pal, you gotflatfeet?

1209
01:40:03,237 --> 01:40:05,472
What the hell
are you talking about, man?

1210
01:40:05,539 --> 01:40:07,975
Something had
to get you offthe street.

1211
01:40:08,042 --> 01:40:09,243
What's the matter?

1212
01:40:09,343 --> 01:40:12,579
You don't thinkjockeyingpapers
across a desk is a noble effortfora cop?

1213
01:40:14,515 --> 01:40:15,783
No.

1214
01:40:19,219 --> 01:40:21,255
I had an accident.

1215
01:40:21,355 --> 01:40:23,657
The wayyou drive, I can see why.

1216
01:40:23,724 --> 01:40:24,491
What'd you do ?

1217
01:40:24,558 --> 01:40:27,161
Run over your captain's foot
with the car?

1218
01:40:31,031 --> 01:40:32,232
I shot a kid.

1219
01:40:33,834 --> 01:40:35,669
He was 13 years old.

1220
01:40:36,904 --> 01:40:38,972
Oh, it was dark. I couldn'tsee him.

1221
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:40,974
He hada raygun, lookedreal enough.

1222
01:40:44,211 --> 01:40:47,981
When you're a rookie, they teach you
everything about being a cop

1223
01:40:48,048 --> 01:40:49,917
except how to live with a mistake.

1224
01:40:53,921 --> 01:40:58,292
Anyway, ljust couldn'tbring myself
to drawmygun on anybody again.

1225
01:41:01,762 --> 01:41:03,097
Sorry, man.

1226
01:41:04,598 --> 01:41:07,301
Hey, man, how could you know?

1227
01:41:09,636 --> 01:41:11,472
I feel like shit anyway.

1228
01:41:14,475 --> 01:41:16,076
Well, then, this won't matter.

1229
01:41:16,176 --> 01:41:20,914
The LAPD is not calling the shots
down here any more.

1230
01:41:23,384 --> 01:41:24,551
The Feds?

1231
01:41:25,085 --> 01:41:26,186
You got it.

1232
01:41:27,755 --> 01:41:30,057
Those are the city engineers.

1233
01:41:31,258 --> 01:41:32,025
Wait.

1234
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:34,728
They're going into the street circuits.

1235
01:41:34,795 --> 01:41:37,865
Those guys in the suits,
I don't know who they are.

1236
01:41:37,931 --> 01:41:38,866
That's the FBl.

1237
01:41:39,767 --> 01:41:43,337
They're ordering the others
to cut the building's power.

1238
01:41:43,437 --> 01:41:45,439
Regular as clockwork.

1239
01:41:47,274 --> 01:41:48,876
Or a time lock.

1240
01:41:49,343 --> 01:41:51,111
Precisely.

1241
01:41:51,211 --> 01:41:55,049
The circuits that cannot be cut
are cut automatically

1242
01:41:55,115 --> 01:41:57,851
in response to a terrorist incident.

1243
01:41:57,951 --> 01:42:00,087
You asked for miracles, Theo.

1244
01:42:00,154 --> 01:42:04,324
I give you the F-B-l.

1245
01:42:04,425 --> 01:42:06,326
I want the building shut down.

1246
01:42:06,427 --> 01:42:08,595
I got a problem. I got a switch...

1247
01:42:08,662 --> 01:42:12,666
I don't care
about your switch. I want it out. Dark!

1248
01:42:13,634 --> 01:42:15,169
You can't do it from here.

1249
01:42:15,269 --> 01:42:17,671
- Yeah, you could.
- It can't be done from here.

1250
01:42:17,771 --> 01:42:19,440
I could just... I got the radio...

1251
01:42:19,506 --> 01:42:23,010
You can't do it from here.
It's got to be done from downtown.

1252
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:24,878
They've gotta take out
a whole city grid.

1253
01:42:24,978 --> 01:42:26,947
We're talking 10 square blocks.

1254
01:42:27,014 --> 01:42:28,849
Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.

1255
01:42:28,949 --> 01:42:31,518
It's Christmas Eve.
There's thousands of people.

1256
01:42:31,618 --> 01:42:33,287
You have to go wider.

1257
01:42:33,353 --> 01:42:38,459
- I need authorisation.
- How about the United States government?

1258
01:42:38,525 --> 01:42:40,627
Lose the grid, or you lose yourjob.

1259
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,569
- Yeah, Central?
- Yeah?

1260
01:42:48,669 --> 01:42:51,004
This is Walt down at Nakatomi.

1261
01:42:51,105 --> 01:42:56,009
Would it be possible for you
to turn off grid 212?

1262
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:57,211
Are you crazy?!

1263
01:42:57,311 --> 01:42:59,980
Maybe I should call the Mayor.

1264
01:43:00,047 --> 01:43:03,150
No shit it's my ass.
I got a big problem here.

1265
01:43:03,217 --> 01:43:05,586
Shut it down now.

1266
01:43:08,889 --> 01:43:11,158
Emergency lighting activated.

1267
01:43:11,725 --> 01:43:14,561
Al, talk to me. What's going on here?

1268
01:43:14,661 --> 01:43:16,196
Ask the FBl.

1269
01:43:16,296 --> 01:43:19,033
They got the universal
terrorist playbook

1270
01:43:19,133 --> 01:43:21,535
and they're running it step by step.

1271
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:25,572
It's gonna go. It's gonna go!

1272
01:43:27,374 --> 01:43:28,776
Yes!

1273
01:43:51,632 --> 01:43:53,100
Merry Christmas.

1274
01:43:54,635 --> 01:43:57,805
They must be pissing in their pants.

1275
01:43:57,905 --> 01:43:59,773
The Mayor is gonna have my ass.

1276
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:08,115
Whoo!

1277
01:44:21,095 --> 01:44:23,364
What are we gonna do now ?

1278
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:26,433
Arrest them for not paying
their electric bill?

1279
01:44:26,533 --> 01:44:28,302
We've shut them down.

1280
01:44:28,402 --> 01:44:31,805
We let them sweat for a while,
then we give them helicopters.

1281
01:44:31,905 --> 01:44:34,108
Right up the ass.

1282
01:44:36,677 --> 01:44:38,245
This is Agent Johnson.

1283
01:44:38,312 --> 01:44:39,680
No, the other one.

1284
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:43,083
I want that air support ready
to lift off in five minutes.

1285
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:46,620
Damn right. Fully armed.
We're on the way.

1286
01:44:52,559 --> 01:44:54,461
Oh, yes!

1287
01:44:56,163 --> 01:44:58,599
I wish to talk to the FBl.

1288
01:45:01,168 --> 01:45:03,303
This is Special Agent Johnson.

1289
01:45:03,404 --> 01:45:07,841
The State Departmenthas arranged
for the return ofyour comrades.

1290
01:45:07,941 --> 01:45:10,577
Helicopters are en route
as you requested.

1291
01:45:10,644 --> 01:45:11,979
I hearyou. We'll be ready.

1292
01:45:12,046 --> 01:45:15,416
By the time he figures out
what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.

1293
01:45:15,482 --> 01:45:17,351
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.

1294
01:45:17,451 --> 01:45:19,186
They'll spend a month
sifting through the rubble.

1295
01:45:19,286 --> 01:45:22,222
By the time they figure out
what went wrong,

1296
01:45:22,322 --> 01:45:25,459
we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20%.

1297
01:45:30,330 --> 01:45:31,832
Ah! Jeez!

1298
01:45:31,899 --> 01:45:32,966
Powell?

1299
01:45:33,801 --> 01:45:35,636
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

1300
01:45:37,371 --> 01:45:39,073
I'm here, John.

1301
01:45:40,808 --> 01:45:43,844
Listen, I'm starting to get
a bad feeling up here.

1302
01:45:44,445 --> 01:45:46,380
I want you to do something for me.

1303
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:47,715
Um... ahem...

1304
01:45:49,249 --> 01:45:50,718
I want you to find my wife.

1305
01:45:50,818 --> 01:45:53,187
Don't ask me how.
By then you'll know how.

1306
01:45:53,253 --> 01:45:56,657
Uh, I want you
to tell her something.

1307
01:45:58,258 --> 01:45:59,927
I want you to tell her that...

1308
01:46:06,867 --> 01:46:09,536
Tell her it took me
a while to figure out

1309
01:46:09,636 --> 01:46:11,572
what ajerk I've been

1310
01:46:12,272 --> 01:46:13,540
but, um...

1311
01:46:15,209 --> 01:46:16,210
that...

1312
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,816
that when things started
to pan out for her

1313
01:46:22,883 --> 01:46:26,920
I should have been more supportive.

1314
01:46:27,388 --> 01:46:28,255
And, uh...

1315
01:46:29,757 --> 01:46:32,693
Ijustshouldhave been
behind hermore.

1316
01:46:35,496 --> 01:46:36,730
Oh, shit.

1317
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,502
Tell her that, um

1318
01:46:42,403 --> 01:46:46,974
that she's the best thing
that ever happened to a bum like me.

1319
01:46:48,909 --> 01:46:52,379
She's heard me say "l love you"
a thousand times.

1320
01:46:53,547 --> 01:46:56,950
She never heard me say I'm sorry.

1321
01:46:57,584 --> 01:47:03,791
I want you to tell her that, Al.
Tell her that John said that he was sorry.

1322
01:47:05,159 --> 01:47:06,226
OK?

1323
01:47:07,161 --> 01:47:08,328
You got that, man?

1324
01:47:08,429 --> 01:47:10,731
Yeah, lgotit, John.

1325
01:47:11,999 --> 01:47:13,734
But you can tell her that yourself.

1326
01:47:13,801 --> 01:47:18,338
You just watch your ass
and you'll make it out. You hear me?

1327
01:47:18,872 --> 01:47:21,475
I guess that's up to the man upstairs.

1328
01:47:24,878 --> 01:47:26,346
John?

1329
01:47:27,181 --> 01:47:28,649
John?

1330
01:47:29,116 --> 01:47:32,653
What the fuck
were you doing upstairs, Hans?

1331
01:47:34,288 --> 01:47:35,322
John?

1332
01:47:35,422 --> 01:47:38,525
No, Al, listen.
Just lay offfor a while.

1333
01:47:40,527 --> 01:47:43,297
I gotta go check on something.

1334
01:47:45,899 --> 01:47:48,602
One minute, that's all I'm asking.

1335
01:47:48,669 --> 01:47:50,537
One minute to speak to them.

1336
01:47:50,637 --> 01:47:52,673
All right. Get back. Get back.

1337
01:47:52,773 --> 01:47:55,142
All right, look.

1338
01:47:55,209 --> 01:47:59,380
You let me in right now,
or I call the INS, comprende?

1339
01:48:01,982 --> 01:48:04,318
This is the last time
these kids are gonna have

1340
01:48:04,385 --> 01:48:06,520
to speak to their parents.

1341
01:48:08,188 --> 01:48:09,323
All right?

1342
01:48:09,656 --> 01:48:11,792
All right. Come on. Come on.

1343
01:48:21,869 --> 01:48:23,237
What were you doing, Hans?

1344
01:48:24,038 --> 01:48:25,539
What were you doing?

1345
01:48:47,895 --> 01:48:51,098
Jesus, Mary, mother of God.

1346
01:48:54,535 --> 01:48:57,171
Al, listen to me!
It's a double-cross!

1347
01:48:57,237 --> 01:48:58,872
The roof is wired to...

1348
01:49:01,575 --> 01:49:02,609
John?

1349
01:49:05,012 --> 01:49:06,547
John!

1350
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:08,215
John, come in!

1351
01:49:08,749 --> 01:49:09,817
Did you get that?

1352
01:49:09,883 --> 01:49:12,886
Something about a double-cross.

1353
01:49:12,986 --> 01:49:15,289
Tell me about it.

1354
01:49:20,994 --> 01:49:23,230
We are both professionals.

1355
01:49:25,366 --> 01:49:27,034
This is personal.

1356
01:49:28,402 --> 01:49:29,770
Aww...

1357
01:49:50,624 --> 01:49:53,060
They're coming!

1358
01:49:53,594 --> 01:49:55,262
Choppers are coming.

1359
01:49:55,562 --> 01:49:58,899
Time to gather your flock,
Miss Gennero.

1360
01:49:58,966 --> 01:50:03,070
Your mom and dad
are veryimportantpeople.

1361
01:50:03,137 --> 01:50:05,105
They're verybrave people.

1362
01:50:05,205 --> 01:50:09,209
Is there somethingyou'dlike
to say to them, ifthey're watching?

1363
01:50:09,276 --> 01:50:12,446
Come home.

1364
01:50:20,921 --> 01:50:22,256
Mrs McClane.

1365
01:50:25,492 --> 01:50:28,829
How nice to make your acquaintance.

1366
01:50:32,066 --> 01:50:34,068
On your feet, everyone! To the roof!

1367
01:50:34,134 --> 01:50:36,804
Lock them up there
and come right back.

1368
01:51:03,797 --> 01:51:06,800
You should have heard
your brother squeal

1369
01:51:06,867 --> 01:51:10,037
when I broke his fucking neck!

1370
01:51:13,307 --> 01:51:15,676
What do you figure the breakage?

1371
01:51:15,743 --> 01:51:17,911
I figure we take out the terrorists,

1372
01:51:18,011 --> 01:51:20,981
Iose 20, 25% ofthe hostages, tops.

1373
01:51:21,749 --> 01:51:24,184
I can live with that.

1374
01:51:24,284 --> 01:51:25,652
Get this thing on the deck.

1375
01:51:25,719 --> 01:51:29,189
They're expecting transports,
not gun ships.

1376
01:51:41,201 --> 01:51:43,037
Move it! Come on! Move!

1377
01:51:43,137 --> 01:51:44,705
Come on! Come on!

1378
01:51:44,772 --> 01:51:46,040
Move it!

1379
01:51:47,241 --> 01:51:48,509
Go! Move!

1380
01:51:52,379 --> 01:51:53,347
Theo.

1381
01:51:53,881 --> 01:51:55,482
A little bonus for us.

1382
01:51:55,549 --> 01:51:57,551
Please, sit down. Sit down!

1383
01:51:57,618 --> 01:52:00,354
A policeman's wife
might come in handy.

1384
01:52:00,421 --> 01:52:02,923
McClane, I have some news for you.

1385
01:52:03,957 --> 01:52:05,259
McClane?

1386
01:52:16,737 --> 01:52:18,038
Move!

1387
01:52:20,708 --> 01:52:21,442
Come on!

1388
01:52:34,288 --> 01:52:36,590
Motherfucker! I'll kill you!

1389
01:52:40,527 --> 01:52:41,595
Armed.

1390
01:52:42,062 --> 01:52:44,098
- The truck?
- The truck.

1391
01:52:51,271 --> 01:52:55,309
After all your posturing,
all your little speeches,

1392
01:52:55,409 --> 01:52:57,778
you're nothing but a common thief.

1393
01:52:57,978 --> 01:53:00,481
I am an exceptional thief,
Mrs McClane.

1394
01:53:00,581 --> 01:53:02,149
And since I'm moving up
to kidnapping,

1395
01:53:02,249 --> 01:53:04,251
you should be more polite.

1396
01:53:11,291 --> 01:53:13,427
You motherfucker,
I'm gonna kill you!

1397
01:53:13,494 --> 01:53:16,964
I'm gonna fuckin' cook you,
and I'm gonna fuckin' eat you!

1398
01:53:39,586 --> 01:53:41,655
I don't like this, Sarge.

1399
01:53:49,363 --> 01:53:55,302
Yee-hah!
Just like fucking Saigon, eh, Slick?

1400
01:53:56,837 --> 01:53:59,707
I was in Junior High, dickhead.

1401
01:54:27,634 --> 01:54:29,069
Where's Holly?

1402
01:54:29,169 --> 01:54:30,637
Where's Holly Gennero?

1403
01:54:30,704 --> 01:54:32,840
Holly Gennero? Where's Holly?

1404
01:54:32,906 --> 01:54:34,742
Where's Holly? Where is she?

1405
01:54:34,842 --> 01:54:36,276
- They took her!
- Where?

1406
01:54:36,377 --> 01:54:37,578
The vault!

1407
01:54:37,678 --> 01:54:39,580
- Where is the vault?
- The 30th floor!

1408
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:41,582
They just took her!

1409
01:54:41,815 --> 01:54:42,916
Get downstairs!

1410
01:54:43,017 --> 01:54:45,519
The whole fucking roof
is wired to blow!

1411
01:54:45,586 --> 01:54:47,187
Get down!

1412
01:54:47,254 --> 01:54:49,857
Get down!
Get the fuck downstairs!

1413
01:54:52,059 --> 01:54:54,928
They made us, Bureau.
Terrorist shooting hostages.

1414
01:54:55,029 --> 01:54:56,730
Break left!

1415
01:55:02,970 --> 01:55:04,671
Nail that sucker!

1416
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:15,849
I'm on your side, you assholes!

1417
01:55:15,916 --> 01:55:19,053
Swing around again!
I'll bag this little bastard.

1418
01:55:37,938 --> 01:55:39,773
What the fuck...

1419
01:55:41,742 --> 01:55:44,611
Oh, John,
what the fuck are you doing?

1420
01:55:44,712 --> 01:55:47,581
How the fuck
did you get into this shit?

1421
01:55:57,591 --> 01:56:00,994
There's something wrong!
They're coming back down!

1422
01:56:01,095 --> 01:56:03,263
- Blow the roof.
- But Karl's up there!

1423
01:56:03,330 --> 01:56:04,765
Blow the roof!

1424
01:56:08,001 --> 01:56:10,904
I promise I will never even think

1425
01:56:10,971 --> 01:56:13,974
about going up
in a tall building again.

1426
01:56:17,311 --> 01:56:19,646
Oh, God, please don't let me die!

1427
01:57:51,271 --> 01:57:53,774
Holy Christ!

1428
01:57:54,942 --> 01:57:57,578
We're gonna need
some more FBI guys, I guess.

1429
01:58:10,324 --> 01:58:12,126
Jesus fucking Christ!

1430
01:58:13,093 --> 01:58:14,228
Fuck!

1431
01:58:38,619 --> 01:58:41,155
What the fuck is going on?

1432
01:58:43,057 --> 01:58:46,627
What are you gonna do?
Sit here while the building falls down?

1433
01:58:54,968 --> 01:58:55,836
Shit!

1434
01:58:55,936 --> 01:58:57,805
All right!

1435
01:58:59,273 --> 01:59:00,474
Hey! Hey!

1436
01:59:01,442 --> 01:59:03,243
Hang on, baby.

1437
01:59:03,310 --> 01:59:04,878
Hang on, honey.

1438
01:59:05,946 --> 01:59:06,980
Oh, God.

1439
01:59:52,126 --> 01:59:53,827
Hans!

1440
02:00:08,342 --> 02:00:10,077
Jesus.

1441
02:00:10,177 --> 02:00:13,414
Hi, honey.

1442
02:00:34,501 --> 02:00:38,439
So that's what this is all about?
A fucking robbery?

1443
02:00:38,906 --> 02:00:40,107
Put down the gun.

1444
02:00:41,809 --> 02:00:44,111
Why'd you have to nuke
the whole building, Hans?

1445
02:00:44,211 --> 02:00:47,247
Well, when you steal $600,
you can just disappear.

1446
02:00:47,348 --> 02:00:50,351
When you steal 600 million,
they will find you

1447
02:00:50,417 --> 02:00:52,720
unless they think
you're already dead.

1448
02:00:52,786 --> 02:00:54,922
Put down the gun.

1449
02:01:05,399 --> 02:01:07,067
Nein. This is mine.

1450
02:01:10,304 --> 02:01:12,139
You got me.

1451
02:01:12,239 --> 02:01:15,009
Still the cowboy, Mr McClane.

1452
02:01:15,109 --> 02:01:16,777
Americans... all alike.

1453
02:01:16,844 --> 02:01:20,814
This time, John Wayne does not walk off
into the sunset with Grace Kelly.

1454
02:01:20,914 --> 02:01:22,750
That was Gary Cooper, asshole.

1455
02:01:22,816 --> 02:01:24,618
Enough jokes.

1456
02:01:24,685 --> 02:01:27,588
You'd have made a pretty
good cowboy yourself, Hans.

1457
02:01:27,654 --> 02:01:32,326
Oh, yes. What was it
you said to me before?

1458
02:01:32,426 --> 02:01:36,163
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

1459
02:01:57,317 --> 02:01:57,785
Holly!

1460
02:02:03,891 --> 02:02:05,426
Happy trails, Hans.

1461
02:02:10,898 --> 02:02:12,533
- Aah!
- Holly.

1462
02:02:50,070 --> 02:02:51,939
I hope that's not a hostage.

1463
02:03:20,367 --> 02:03:24,371
Gimme water hook-ups
for engine companies 5, 3, 9, 6.

1464
02:03:28,042 --> 02:03:29,677
Over here. It's a better angle.

1465
02:03:29,743 --> 02:03:31,679
Let's give them a hand.

1466
02:03:34,314 --> 02:03:37,384
Keep it going, now. Keep it going.

1467
02:03:42,423 --> 02:03:46,060
- Come on. We're going to miss it!
- OK. Hand me my notes!

1468
02:04:09,083 --> 02:04:13,153
What was it like in there?
How did they treat you?

1469
02:04:59,366 --> 02:05:01,135
Al, this is my wife Holly.

1470
02:05:01,201 --> 02:05:03,137
Holly Gennero.

1471
02:05:03,871 --> 02:05:05,639
Holly McClane.

1472
02:05:05,706 --> 02:05:07,374
Hello, Holly.

1473
02:05:07,474 --> 02:05:09,410
You got yourself a good man.

1474
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:11,512
You take good care of him.

1475
02:05:12,179 --> 02:05:13,681
McClane!

1476
02:05:13,781 --> 02:05:16,483
McClane, I want a debriefing!

1477
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:19,219
You got some things
to answer for, mister.

1478
02:05:19,319 --> 02:05:21,055
Ellis' murder, for one thing.

1479
02:05:21,155 --> 02:05:24,892
Property damage,
interfering with police business.

1480
02:06:05,265 --> 02:06:08,369
Two ofyou go inside
and see ifthere's anybody else!

1481
02:06:19,113 --> 02:06:21,715
No. This one's with me.

1482
02:06:31,625 --> 02:06:33,260
Mr McClane, Mr McClane!

1483
02:06:33,327 --> 02:06:35,896
Now that it's all over,
after this incredible ordeal,

1484
02:06:35,963 --> 02:06:37,931
what are your feelings?

1485
02:06:43,203 --> 02:06:44,605
Well, well, well.

1486
02:06:44,672 --> 02:06:48,942
- Merry Christmas, Argyle.
- Merry Christmas.

1487
02:06:52,479 --> 02:06:53,514
Did you get that?

1488
02:06:53,614 --> 02:06:55,616
Let me through.

1489
02:06:56,116 --> 02:06:59,653
If this is their idea of Christmas,
I gotta be here for New Year's.

1490
02:07:00,154 --> 02:07:01,188
Yo, Al.

1491
02:07:01,288 --> 02:07:03,323
I'm here, Roy,
but I'm kind of busy right now.

1492
02:07:03,390 --> 02:07:04,291
I'll talk to you later.

1493
02:07:04,358 --> 02:07:05,125
Al, what's wrong?

1494
02:07:05,192 --> 02:07:06,527
I'll talk to you later.

1495
02:07:06,593 --> 02:07:08,228
If you are what I think you are,

1496
02:07:08,295 --> 02:07:10,330
you'll know when to listen,
shut up, and

1497
02:07:11,532 --> 02:07:13,100
and when to pray.

1498
02:07:13,167 --> 02:07:14,935
Jesus Christ!
You're coming in, right?

1499
02:07:15,002 --> 02:07:16,103
Christ, Powell,

1500
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:17,804
I told you what kind of people
you're dealing with here.

1501
02:07:17,871 --> 02:07:19,706
Let's load them up.

1502
02:07:22,442 --> 02:07:24,411
They'll be coming.
Everyone get ready.

1503
02:07:25,145 --> 02:07:27,247
Theo, you are the eyes now.

1504
02:07:37,224 --> 02:07:38,258
- Rivers.
- Yo.

1505
02:07:38,325 --> 02:07:40,561
Begin your reconnoitre.

1506
02:07:41,061 --> 02:07:42,162
Let's go.

1507
02:07:44,731 --> 02:07:45,999
Shit!

1508
02:08:01,148 --> 02:08:02,950
Come on. Let's go.

1509
02:08:10,958 --> 02:08:12,326
Ow! Jesus!

1510
02:08:39,586 --> 02:08:41,522
All right, spread out.

1511
02:09:02,242 --> 02:09:03,510
Shut up.

1512
02:09:04,945 --> 02:09:06,446
Let's go.

1513
02:09:10,184 --> 02:09:11,718
You macho assholes. No! No!

1514
02:09:14,087 --> 02:09:16,323
Ahem... all right. Listen up, guys.

1515
02:09:17,424 --> 02:09:19,159
'Twas the night before Christmas

1516
02:09:19,226 --> 02:09:20,828
and all through the house

1517
02:09:20,894 --> 02:09:22,863
not a creature was stirring, except

1518
02:09:22,930 --> 02:09:25,299
the four assholes
coming in the rear in standard

1519
02:09:25,365 --> 02:09:26,800
two-by-two cover formation.

1520
02:09:28,735 --> 02:09:29,770
We're all set.

1521
02:09:30,871 --> 02:09:32,372
We're ready.

1522
02:09:32,506 --> 02:09:33,574
Kick ass.

1523
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:34,541
Go!

1524
02:09:34,608 --> 02:09:36,343
Right. Let's do it.

1525
02:09:48,722 --> 02:09:49,857
Take cover!

1526
02:09:50,190 --> 02:09:51,391
They're shooting at 'em.

1527
02:09:51,458 --> 02:09:53,093
It's panic fire.
They can't see anything.

1528
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:54,661
They're shooting at the lights.

1529
02:09:58,098 --> 02:10:00,934
They're going after the lights.
Call them back.

1530
02:10:01,702 --> 02:10:02,836
It's not happening.

1531
02:10:02,903 --> 02:10:03,871
Mike, burn it.

1532
02:10:05,672 --> 02:10:07,040
Don't be impatient.

1533
02:10:07,708 --> 02:10:09,142
Just wound them.

1534
02:10:10,744 --> 02:10:12,779
Get them back.
They're sitting ducks without lights.

1535
02:10:12,846 --> 02:10:14,281
They're almost in.

1536
02:10:14,348 --> 02:10:15,282
Send in the car.

1537
02:10:15,349 --> 02:10:16,650
Send in the car.

1538
02:10:27,327 --> 02:10:28,428
Jesus Christ!

1539
02:10:30,931 --> 02:10:33,133
Rivers, Rodriguez, report.

1540
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:35,536
Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?

1541
02:10:38,772 --> 02:10:40,908
The police have themselves an RV.

1542
02:10:45,145 --> 02:10:46,213
Southeast corner.

1543
02:10:56,690 --> 02:10:58,192
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1544
02:11:07,734 --> 02:11:09,903
Get back! Get the fuck back!

1545
02:11:11,338 --> 02:11:12,239
Get over there.

1546
02:11:12,306 --> 02:11:13,440
Schnell! Schnell!

1547
02:11:13,507 --> 02:11:15,209
Mach schnell!

1548
02:11:17,511 --> 02:11:18,979
Weiter! Weiter! Weiter!

1549
02:11:19,046 --> 02:11:20,547
Mach schnell! Mach schnell!

1550
02:11:20,614 --> 02:11:21,548
Weiter!

1551
02:11:23,951 --> 02:11:25,185
Mach los! Mach los!

1552
02:11:41,201 --> 02:11:41,969
I see him!

1553
02:11:51,278 --> 02:11:52,613
- Fire!
- Clear!

1554
02:11:57,417 --> 02:11:59,820
Oh, my God!
The quarterback is toast!

1555
02:12:00,287 --> 02:12:02,356
Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.

1556
02:12:03,357 --> 02:12:04,124
Hit it again.

1557
02:12:04,191 --> 02:12:06,059
All right, you motherfucker,
you made your point!

1558
02:12:06,126 --> 02:12:06,793
Let them pull back!

1559
02:12:06,860 --> 02:12:08,862
Thank you, Mr Cowboy.
I'll take it under advisement.

1560
02:12:08,929 --> 02:12:09,229
Hit it

1561
02:12:09,296 --> 02:12:10,130
again.

1562
02:12:21,542 --> 02:12:22,576
Fire.

1563
02:12:34,221 --> 02:12:35,789
Fuck me.

1564
02:12:35,856 --> 02:12:37,891
Get them out of the car! They're burning!

1565
02:12:46,099 --> 02:12:46,600
Fuck it.

1566
02:12:48,902 --> 02:12:50,237
Mach schnell! Mach los!

1567
02:12:56,543 --> 02:12:59,446
Let's see you take this
under advisement, jerkweed.

1568
02:13:02,416 --> 02:13:04,017
Geronimo, motherfucker.

1569
02:13:18,966 --> 02:13:19,766
Oh, shit!

1570
02:13:24,004 --> 02:13:25,272
They're using artillery on us!

1571
02:13:25,339 --> 02:13:27,007
You idiot, it's not the police.

1572
02:13:27,474 --> 02:13:28,842
It's him.

1573
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:35,883
Holy shit.

1574
02:13:40,154 --> 02:13:41,321
My God!

1575
02:13:43,056 --> 02:13:45,425
- Tell me you got that.
- I got it.

1576
02:13:46,527 --> 02:13:48,495
Eat your heart out, Channel Five.

1577
02:13:48,562 --> 02:13:49,630
We've had an update

1578
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:51,732
on the terrorist take over
of the Nakatomi building.

1579
02:13:51,798 --> 02:13:53,534
Sources say
the terroristleader, Hans,

1580
02:13:53,600 --> 02:13:55,235
may be this man... Hans Gruber.

1581
02:13:55,302 --> 02:13:57,638
A member ofthe radical
West German Volksfreimovement.

1582
02:13:57,704 --> 02:14:00,741
Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership
issued a communiqu an hour ago

1583
02:14:00,807 --> 02:14:03,043
stating that Gruber had been
expelled from that organisation.

1584
02:14:03,110 --> 02:14:04,778
Al, do you copy?

1585
02:14:05,078 --> 02:14:06,213
Are you all right?

1586
02:14:06,947 --> 02:14:08,048
Yeah, I'm fine.

1587
02:14:08,949 --> 02:14:10,017
W-what was that?

1588
02:14:10,083 --> 02:14:12,419
Remember that plastic
explosive I told you about?

1589
02:14:12,486 --> 02:14:14,822
There you go.
Is the building on fire?

1590
02:14:14,888 --> 02:14:16,323
No, but it's gonna need a paint job

1591
02:14:16,390 --> 02:14:17,691
and a shitload of screen doors.

1592
02:14:17,758 --> 02:14:19,960
Our spotter said you got two
with that blast.

1593
02:14:20,027 --> 02:14:22,062
- Is that him?
- Yes, sir.

1594
02:14:23,363 --> 02:14:25,499
I don't know who you think you are

1595
02:14:25,566 --> 02:14:27,534
but you just destroyed a building.

1596
02:14:27,601 --> 02:14:30,070
We do not want your help.
Is that clear?

1597
02:14:30,137 --> 02:14:31,605
We don't want your help.

1598
02:14:31,672 --> 02:14:34,141
I've got 100 people down here,
and they're covered with glass.

1599
02:14:34,208 --> 02:14:36,543
Glass? Who gives a shit about glass?

1600
02:14:36,610 --> 02:14:37,377
Who the fuck is this?

1601
02:14:38,679 --> 02:14:40,814
This is Deputy Chief of Police
Dwayne T Robinson

1602
02:14:40,881 --> 02:14:42,449
and I am in charge of this situation.

1603
02:14:42,516 --> 02:14:43,951
Oh, you're in charge?

1604
02:14:44,017 --> 02:14:45,619
I got some bad news for you, Dwayne.

1605
02:14:45,686 --> 02:14:48,322
From up here it doesn'tlook
like you're in charge ofshit.

1606
02:14:48,388 --> 02:14:50,057
Listen to me, you little asshole...

1607
02:14:50,123 --> 02:14:50,791
Asshole?

1608
02:14:50,858 --> 02:14:52,292
I'm not the one
who just got butt fucked

1609
02:14:52,359 --> 02:14:53,827
on national TV, Dwayne.

1610
02:14:53,894 --> 02:14:54,895
Ah ha ha!

1611
02:14:54,962 --> 02:14:56,430
Listen to me,jerk-off,

1612
02:14:56,497 --> 02:14:58,899
if you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.

1613
02:14:58,966 --> 02:15:01,468
Quit being part of the problem
and put the other guy back on!

1614
02:15:03,737 --> 02:15:05,105
Hey, Roy, how you feeling?

1615
02:15:05,172 --> 02:15:06,773
Pretty fucking unappreciated, Al.

1616
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:08,642
Hey, look. I love you.

1617
02:15:08,709 --> 02:15:10,544
So do a lot of the otherguys.

1618
02:15:10,611 --> 02:15:12,679
So hang in there, man, you hear me?

1619
02:15:12,746 --> 02:15:14,281
You hang in there.

1620
02:15:15,549 --> 02:15:17,518
Yeah, thanks, partner.

1621
02:15:22,256 --> 02:15:23,357
What are you doing?

1622
02:15:23,423 --> 02:15:24,424
I'm tired of sitting here

1623
02:15:24,491 --> 02:15:26,160
waiting to see
who gets us killed first,

1624
02:15:26,226 --> 02:15:27,394
them or your husband.

1625
02:15:27,794 --> 02:15:29,062
What are you going to do?

1626
02:15:29,129 --> 02:15:29,796
Hey, babe,

1627
02:15:29,863 --> 02:15:31,365
I negotiate million-dollar deals
for breakfast.

1628
02:15:31,431 --> 02:15:32,933
I think I can handle this Eurotrash.

1629
02:15:33,534 --> 02:15:35,836
Hey, sprechen sie talk, huh?

1630
02:15:35,903 --> 02:15:38,205
If you'd listened to me,
he would be neutralised already.

1631
02:15:38,272 --> 02:15:39,640
I don't want neutral. I want dead.

1632
02:15:40,774 --> 02:15:42,309
Hope I'm not interrupting.

1633
02:15:42,376 --> 02:15:43,210
What does he want?

1634
02:15:43,277 --> 02:15:46,213
It's not what I want.
It's what I can give you.

1635
02:15:52,152 --> 02:15:54,021
Look, let's be straight, OK?

1636
02:15:54,087 --> 02:15:56,123
It's obvious you're not
some dumb schmuck

1637
02:15:56,190 --> 02:15:57,791
up here to snatch a few purses.

1638
02:15:57,858 --> 02:15:59,159
You're very perceptive.

1639
02:15:59,226 --> 02:16:00,561
I watch 60 Minutes.

1640
02:16:00,627 --> 02:16:02,796
I say to myself,
these guys are professional,

1641
02:16:02,863 --> 02:16:04,798
they're motivated, they're happening,

1642
02:16:04,865 --> 02:16:06,133
they want something.

1643
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:08,468
I couldn't care less
about your politics.

1644
02:16:08,535 --> 02:16:10,304
Maybe you're pissed off
at the camel jockeys.

1645
02:16:10,370 --> 02:16:11,538
Maybe it's the Hebes,
Northern lreland.

1646
02:16:11,605 --> 02:16:12,706
It's none of my business.

1647
02:16:12,773 --> 02:16:14,641
I figure you're here
to negotiate, am I right?

1648
02:16:14,708 --> 02:16:15,609
You're amazing.

1649
02:16:15,676 --> 02:16:17,544
You figured this all out already?

1650
02:16:17,611 --> 02:16:19,313
Hey, business is business.

1651
02:16:19,379 --> 02:16:20,914
You use a gun,
I use a fountain pen.

1652
02:16:20,981 --> 02:16:21,982
What's the difference?

1653
02:16:22,049 --> 02:16:22,916
Let's put it in my terms.

1654
02:16:22,983 --> 02:16:24,117
You're here on a hostile takeover.

1655
02:16:24,184 --> 02:16:25,152
You grab us for some green

1656
02:16:25,219 --> 02:16:27,855
but you didn't expect some poison pill
was gonna be running around the building.

1657
02:16:27,921 --> 02:16:28,622
Am I right?

1658
02:16:29,089 --> 02:16:29,923
Hans,

1659
02:16:30,390 --> 02:16:31,258
bubbie...

1660
02:16:31,658 --> 02:16:33,060
I'm your white knight.

1661
02:16:33,961 --> 02:16:36,096
I must have missed 60 Minutes.

1662
02:16:36,163 --> 02:16:36,997
What are you saying?

1663
02:16:38,932 --> 02:16:41,502
The guy upstairs
who's fucking things up, huh?

1664
02:16:45,005 --> 02:16:46,573
I can give him to you.

1665
02:16:48,709 --> 02:16:50,377
Oh, God...

1666
02:16:52,045 --> 02:16:53,947
Roy? Roy, you all right?

1667
02:16:54,948 --> 02:16:57,384
Just trying to fire down
a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.

1668
02:16:58,185 --> 02:16:59,386
What do they put in these things,

1669
02:16:59,453 --> 02:17:00,120
anyway?

1670
02:17:00,554 --> 02:17:01,989
Sugar, enriched flour,

1671
02:17:02,055 --> 02:17:03,690
partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil,

1672
02:17:03,757 --> 02:17:04,892
polysorbate 60,

1673
02:17:04,958 --> 02:17:06,326
and yellow dye number five.

1674
02:17:06,393 --> 02:17:08,762
Just everything
a growing boyneeds.

1675
02:17:09,229 --> 02:17:10,731
How many kids you got, Al?

1676
02:17:10,797 --> 02:17:14,034
As a matter of fact,
my wife is working on our first.

1677
02:17:14,101 --> 02:17:15,402
How about you, cowboy?

1678
02:17:15,469 --> 02:17:17,471
You got any kids
back on your ranch?

1679
02:17:18,438 --> 02:17:19,406
Yeah.

1680
02:17:19,873 --> 02:17:20,507
Two.

1681
02:17:21,074 --> 02:17:22,476
Sure hope I can see them

1682
02:17:22,543 --> 02:17:24,378
swinging on ajungle gym
with AI Jnr someday.

1683
02:17:26,346 --> 02:17:27,781
Well, now, that's a date

1684
02:17:27,848 --> 02:17:29,550
but you bring the ice cream.

1685
02:17:29,917 --> 02:17:31,718
Touching, cowboy. Touching.

1686
02:17:32,452 --> 02:17:33,487
Or shouldl call you

1687
02:17:33,554 --> 02:17:35,255
Mr McClane?

1688
02:17:36,323 --> 02:17:38,458
Mr Officer John McClane

1689
02:17:38,525 --> 02:17:40,661
of the New York
Police Department?

1690
02:17:41,929 --> 02:17:43,730
Get on the phone to Harry in New York.

1691
02:17:43,797 --> 02:17:45,666
You better get a hold of somebody
at Dispatch.

1692
02:17:45,732 --> 02:17:48,468
Sister Theresa called me
Mr McClane in the third grade.

1693
02:17:48,535 --> 02:17:50,571
My friends call me John

1694
02:17:50,637 --> 02:17:52,873
and you're neither, shithead.

1695
02:17:52,940 --> 02:17:55,909
I have someone
who wants to talk to you.

1696
02:17:55,976 --> 02:17:58,145
A very special friend

1697
02:17:58,212 --> 02:18:00,280
who was with you
at the party tonight.

1698
02:18:05,052 --> 02:18:06,753
Hey, John boy.

1699
02:18:07,788 --> 02:18:08,956
Ellis?

1700
02:18:09,156 --> 02:18:10,224
Yeah.

1701
02:18:10,290 --> 02:18:13,460
Listen, John, they're giving me
a few minutes to talk sense into you.

1702
02:18:13,527 --> 02:18:15,963
I know you think you're doing yourjob
and I can appreciate that

1703
02:18:16,029 --> 02:18:17,397
but you'rejust dragging
this thing out.

1704
02:18:17,464 --> 02:18:19,900
Look, no-one gets out of here
until these guys

1705
02:18:19,967 --> 02:18:21,335
can talk to the LA Police.

1706
02:18:21,401 --> 02:18:24,104
That won't happen until you stop
messing up the works. Capisce?

1707
02:18:28,542 --> 02:18:29,943
Ellis, what have you told them?

1708
02:18:30,010 --> 02:18:33,280
I told them we were old friends
and you were my guest

1709
02:18:33,347 --> 02:18:34,515
at the party.

1710
02:18:35,349 --> 02:18:36,917
Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.

1711
02:18:36,984 --> 02:18:37,985
Tell me about it.

1712
02:18:43,290 --> 02:18:44,658
All right, John, listen.

1713
02:18:44,725 --> 02:18:47,294
They want you to tell them
where the detonators are.

1714
02:18:47,361 --> 02:18:49,163
They know people are listening.

1715
02:18:49,229 --> 02:18:52,399
They want the detonators,
or they're gonna kill me.

1716
02:18:55,235 --> 02:18:56,370
John, didn't you hear me?

1717
02:18:58,338 --> 02:18:59,840
Yeah, I hear you.

1718
02:18:59,907 --> 02:19:01,408
John, get with the programme.

1719
02:19:01,475 --> 02:19:03,544
The police are here now.
It's their problem.

1720
02:19:03,610 --> 02:19:05,646
Tell these guys where the detonators are
so no-one else gets hurt!

1721
02:19:05,712 --> 02:19:08,148
I'm putting my life
on the line for you, pal!

1722
02:19:08,215 --> 02:19:09,983
Ellis, listen to me carefully.

1723
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:10,317
John...

1724
02:19:10,384 --> 02:19:11,985
Shut up, Ellis!
Just shut your mouth!

1725
02:19:12,586 --> 02:19:13,720
Put Hans back on the line.

1726
02:19:13,787 --> 02:19:17,457
Hans, this shithead doesn'tknow
what kind of man you are but l do.

1727
02:19:17,524 --> 02:19:19,126
Good. Then you'll
give us what we want

1728
02:19:19,193 --> 02:19:20,294
and save your friend's life.

1729
02:19:20,360 --> 02:19:22,129
You're not part ofthis equation.

1730
02:19:22,196 --> 02:19:24,031
Hey, what am l, a method actor?

1731
02:19:24,097 --> 02:19:25,365
Babe, putaway the gun.

1732
02:19:25,432 --> 02:19:26,767
This is radio, not television.

1733
02:19:26,834 --> 02:19:28,502
Hans, this asshole is not my friend!

1734
02:19:28,569 --> 02:19:29,736
I just met him tonight!
I don't know him!

1735
02:19:29,803 --> 02:19:31,438
Jesus Christ, Ellis!
These people will kill you!

1736
02:19:31,505 --> 02:19:33,006
Tell them you don't know me!

1737
02:19:33,907 --> 02:19:35,843
How can you say that
after all these years?

1738
02:19:35,909 --> 02:19:38,745
John? John?

1739
02:19:57,664 --> 02:19:58,565
Do you hear that?

1740
02:19:59,199 --> 02:20:01,134
Talk to me!
Where are my detonators?

1741
02:20:01,502 --> 02:20:03,570
Where are they,
or shall I shoot another one?

1742
02:20:03,637 --> 02:20:04,638
Sooner or later

1743
02:20:04,705 --> 02:20:06,773
I mightget to someone
you do care about.

1744
02:20:07,241 --> 02:20:09,309
Go fuck yourself, Hans.

1745
02:20:10,277 --> 02:20:11,945
He just let the guy die.

1746
02:20:12,012 --> 02:20:13,647
He just gave him up.
Give me that headset.

1747
02:20:13,714 --> 02:20:15,382
That's like pulling the trigger yourself.

1748
02:20:15,449 --> 02:20:18,385
Can't you see what's happening?
Can't you read between the lines?

1749
02:20:18,452 --> 02:20:20,287
He did everything he could
to save him.

1750
02:20:20,354 --> 02:20:22,856
If he gave himself up,
they'd both be dead right now!

1751
02:20:22,923 --> 02:20:25,058
No way, man. They'd be talking to us.

1752
02:20:25,125 --> 02:20:27,928
You tell this partner of yours
to stay out of this from now on.

1753
02:20:27,995 --> 02:20:30,430
Because if he doesn't,
I'm really going to nail his ass.

1754
02:20:30,497 --> 02:20:32,065
The man is hurting.

1755
02:20:32,132 --> 02:20:33,433
He is alone, tired,

1756
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:36,436
and he hasn't seen diddly-squat
from anybody here!

1757
02:20:36,503 --> 02:20:38,505
You're gonna tell me he'll give a damn

1758
02:20:38,572 --> 02:20:41,108
about what you do to him
if he makes it out ofthere alive?

1759
02:20:41,175 --> 02:20:43,510
Why don't you wake up
and smell what you're shovelling?

1760
02:20:43,577 --> 02:20:44,845
You listen to me, sergeant.

1761
02:20:44,912 --> 02:20:47,714
Any time you want to go home,
you consider yourself dismissed.

1762
02:20:47,781 --> 02:20:50,450
No, sir.
You couldn't drag me away.

1763
02:20:50,517 --> 02:20:52,019
Attention, police.

1764
02:20:52,953 --> 02:20:54,621
Attention, police.

1765
02:20:54,688 --> 02:20:57,157
- This is Sergeant AI Powell...
- Give me that.

1766
02:20:57,424 --> 02:20:59,259
This is Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.

1767
02:20:59,326 --> 02:21:00,060
Who is this?

1768
02:21:00,127 --> 02:21:01,361
This is Hans Gruber.

1769
02:21:02,362 --> 02:21:05,165
I assume you realise the futility
of direct action against me.

1770
02:21:05,232 --> 02:21:06,767
We have no wish
for further loss of life.

1771
02:21:06,834 --> 02:21:09,269
What is it you do wish for?

1772
02:21:09,336 --> 02:21:12,739
I have comrades in arms
around the world languishing in prison.

1773
02:21:12,806 --> 02:21:15,776
The American State Department
enjoys rattling its sabre for its own ends.

1774
02:21:15,843 --> 02:21:17,478
Now it can rattle it for me.

1775
02:21:18,612 --> 02:21:21,515
The following people
are to be released from their captors.

1776
02:21:22,015 --> 02:21:24,518
In Northern lreland the seven members
of the New Provo Front.

1777
02:21:24,585 --> 02:21:28,288
In Canada, the five imprisonedleaders
ofLibert de Quebec.

1778
02:21:28,355 --> 02:21:31,525
In Sri Lanka, the nine members
of the Asian Dawn.

1779
02:21:31,592 --> 02:21:32,793
What the fuck?

1780
02:21:32,860 --> 02:21:34,328
Asian Dawn?

1781
02:21:34,394 --> 02:21:36,396
I read about them in Time magazine.

1782
02:21:36,463 --> 02:21:39,600
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,

1783
02:21:39,666 --> 02:21:42,236
the hostages in this building
will be taken to the roof

1784
02:21:42,302 --> 02:21:44,171
and they will accompany us
in helicopters

1785
02:21:44,238 --> 02:21:46,039
to the Los Angeles
lnternational Airport

1786
02:21:46,106 --> 02:21:48,208
where they will be given
further instructions.

1787
02:21:48,275 --> 02:21:49,776
You have two hours to comply.

1788
02:21:49,843 --> 02:21:52,613
Wait a minute. Uh, Mr. Gruber.
This is crazy.

1789
02:21:52,679 --> 02:21:55,682
I don't have the authority.
Two hours is not enough.

1790
02:21:55,749 --> 02:21:57,584
Hello? Hello!

1791
02:21:59,253 --> 02:22:01,788
Did you get all that?
We got to make some calls.

1792
02:22:01,855 --> 02:22:03,557
Do you think they'll even try?

1793
02:22:03,624 --> 02:22:04,992
Who cares?

1794
02:22:07,161 --> 02:22:08,896
Theo, are we on schedule?

1795
02:22:08,962 --> 02:22:10,531
One more to go, then it's up to you.

1796
02:22:10,597 --> 02:22:13,333
You better be right
because the last one will take a miracle.

1797
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:14,635
It's Christmas, Theo.

1798
02:22:14,701 --> 02:22:16,737
It's the time of miracles,
so be of good cheer

1799
02:22:16,804 --> 02:22:19,039
and call me
when you hit the last lock.

1800
02:22:19,606 --> 02:22:20,440
Karl,

1801
02:22:20,507 --> 02:22:23,443
hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.

1802
02:22:23,510 --> 02:22:25,212
Fritz is checking the explosives.

1803
02:22:25,279 --> 02:22:27,414
I'll check the explosives.
You just get the detonators.

1804
02:22:27,481 --> 02:22:29,349
Hey, Powell, you out there?

1805
02:22:29,416 --> 02:22:31,552
I'm here, John. I'm here.

1806
02:22:31,985 --> 02:22:34,788
You gotta believe me.
There was nothing I could do.

1807
02:22:34,855 --> 02:22:37,691
Well, it's gonna be
both our asses ifyou're wrong.

1808
02:22:38,125 --> 02:22:39,359
I hear you.

1809
02:22:44,097 --> 02:22:46,033
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

1810
02:22:46,099 --> 02:22:48,135
It doesn'tmake sense, man.

1811
02:22:49,203 --> 02:22:50,270
Hey, don't ask me, man.

1812
02:22:50,337 --> 02:22:52,406
I'm just a deskjockey
who was on my way home when you rang.

1813
02:22:52,473 --> 02:22:55,375
The way you drove that car
I figured you for the street, Al.

1814
02:22:55,442 --> 02:22:57,811
In my youth. In my youth.

1815
02:22:57,878 --> 02:23:01,048
..author of "Hostage Terrorist,
Terrorist Hostage,

1816
02:23:01,114 --> 02:23:02,049
A Study in Duality. "

1817
02:23:02,115 --> 02:23:03,350
Dr Hasseldorf,

1818
02:23:03,417 --> 02:23:05,118
what can we expect
in the next few hours?

1819
02:23:05,185 --> 02:23:05,619
Well, Gail,

1820
02:23:05,686 --> 02:23:07,754
by this time,
the hostages should be going through

1821
02:23:07,821 --> 02:23:09,656
the early stages
of the Helsinki Syndrome.

1822
02:23:09,723 --> 02:23:11,191
As in Helsinki, Sweden.

1823
02:23:11,258 --> 02:23:12,526
Finland.

1824
02:23:12,593 --> 02:23:15,496
Basically, it's when the hostages
and the terrorists

1825
02:23:15,562 --> 02:23:17,664
go through a sort of
psychological transference

1826
02:23:17,731 --> 02:23:19,433
and a projection of dependency.

1827
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:21,768
A strange sort oftrust
and bond develops.

1828
02:23:21,835 --> 02:23:23,904
We've hadsituations
where the hostages

1829
02:23:23,971 --> 02:23:25,839
have embraced their captors
after release

1830
02:23:25,906 --> 02:23:27,774
and even corresponded with them
in prison.

1831
02:23:27,941 --> 02:23:30,177
No, no, darling. Asian Dawn. Dawn.

1832
02:23:30,244 --> 02:23:32,613
D-A-W-N.

1833
02:23:32,679 --> 02:23:33,847
- Sir?
- Yeah?

1834
02:23:33,914 --> 02:23:35,449
Sir, the FBI is here.

1835
02:23:35,516 --> 02:23:38,552
- The FBI is here now?
- Yes, sir. Right over there.

1836
02:23:38,619 --> 02:23:39,520
Hold this.

1837
02:23:39,753 --> 02:23:41,555
Want a breath mint?

1838
02:23:44,791 --> 02:23:46,326
Hey, how you doing, man?

1839
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:48,862
I'm Agent Johnson.
This is Special Agent Johnson.

1840
02:23:48,929 --> 02:23:51,598
- Oh, how you doing?
- No relation.

1841
02:23:51,665 --> 02:23:52,733
I'm, uh...

1842
02:23:53,867 --> 02:23:56,236
I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.
I'm in charge here.

1843
02:23:57,004 --> 02:23:58,639
Not any more.

1844
02:24:42,416 --> 02:24:45,252
Hi, there. How you doing?

1845
02:24:47,921 --> 02:24:48,755
Ohh...

1846
02:24:50,023 --> 02:24:52,559
Please, God. No.
You're one ofthem, aren't you?

1847
02:24:52,626 --> 02:24:53,861
You're one ofthem.

1848
02:24:53,927 --> 02:24:56,230
No! Don't kill me! Please!

1849
02:24:56,296 --> 02:24:58,265
Don't kill me, please!
Please, please, please.

1850
02:24:58,332 --> 02:25:00,567
Whoa. Relax.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1851
02:25:00,634 --> 02:25:01,969
I'm not gonna hurt you!

1852
02:25:04,004 --> 02:25:05,305
Oh, God.

1853
02:25:08,075 --> 02:25:09,309
What the fuck
are you doing up here?

1854
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:10,644
What were you looking for?

1855
02:25:10,711 --> 02:25:12,646
I managed to get out ofthere and

1856
02:25:12,713 --> 02:25:15,215
I was just trying
to get up on the roof

1857
02:25:15,282 --> 02:25:17,451
and see if I could signal for help.

1858
02:25:18,652 --> 02:25:20,354
It's just over here.
Why don't you come and help?

1859
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:22,923
Hold it. Forget the roof.

1860
02:25:23,490 --> 02:25:25,759
I said forget the roof.
They got people all over it.

1861
02:25:26,894 --> 02:25:28,829
You want to stay alive,
you stay with me.

1862
02:25:31,131 --> 02:25:32,766
The best we can figure it,

1863
02:25:32,833 --> 02:25:35,636
we've got maybe
30 or 35 hostages up there

1864
02:25:35,702 --> 02:25:37,237
probably on the 30th floor

1865
02:25:37,304 --> 02:25:40,207
and maybe seven or eight
terrorists up there.

1866
02:25:40,274 --> 02:25:42,009
Sounds like an A-7 scenario.

1867
02:25:42,075 --> 02:25:44,011
Thank you.
We'll handle it from here.

1868
02:25:44,077 --> 02:25:46,346
When we commandeer your men,
we'll try and let you know.

1869
02:25:46,413 --> 02:25:47,981
Aren't you forgetting something?

1870
02:25:48,048 --> 02:25:48,849
Such as?

1871
02:25:48,916 --> 02:25:50,250
What about John McClane?

1872
02:25:50,317 --> 02:25:52,820
He's the reason
we have any information.

1873
02:25:52,886 --> 02:25:55,789
He's also the reason
you're facing seven terrorists, not twelve.

1874
02:25:55,856 --> 02:25:57,724
He's inside? Who is he?

1875
02:25:57,791 --> 02:26:00,127
He might be a cop.
We're checking on that.

1876
02:26:00,194 --> 02:26:02,329
- One ofyours?
- No, no way.

1877
02:26:06,767 --> 02:26:07,468
You smoke?

1878
02:26:08,702 --> 02:26:09,903
Yeah.

1879
02:26:13,674 --> 02:26:14,641
Thanks.

1880
02:26:17,744 --> 02:26:20,047
You don't work for Nakatomi.

1881
02:26:23,484 --> 02:26:24,918
And ifyou're not one ofthem...

1882
02:26:27,454 --> 02:26:28,622
I'm a cop from New York.

1883
02:26:30,123 --> 02:26:31,391
New York?

1884
02:26:31,458 --> 02:26:32,326
Yeah.

1885
02:26:33,060 --> 02:26:35,329
Got invited to
the Christmas party by mistake.

1886
02:26:35,395 --> 02:26:36,430
Who knew?

1887
02:26:42,669 --> 02:26:44,571
Better than being caught
with your pants down, huh?

1888
02:26:52,412 --> 02:26:53,580
I'm John McClane.

1889
02:26:54,648 --> 02:26:55,849
You're, uh...

1890
02:26:56,950 --> 02:26:57,851
Clay.

1891
02:26:59,853 --> 02:27:00,921
Bill Clay.

1892
02:27:05,826 --> 02:27:07,494
Know how to use a handgun, Bill?

1893
02:27:08,629 --> 02:27:10,230
I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.

1894
02:27:10,297 --> 02:27:12,099
That game with the guns
that shoot red paint.

1895
02:27:12,166 --> 02:27:13,967
Probably seems kind of stupid to you.

1896
02:27:15,102 --> 02:27:16,069
Nope.

1897
02:27:18,539 --> 02:27:20,007
Time for the real thing, Bill.

1898
02:27:26,847 --> 02:27:28,649
All you got to do
is pull the trigger.

1899
02:27:29,216 --> 02:27:29,683
Come on.

1900
02:27:45,232 --> 02:27:46,433
Put down the gun

1901
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:48,669
and give me my detonators.

1902
02:27:52,206 --> 02:27:53,340
Well, well, well...

1903
02:27:54,908 --> 02:27:55,742
Hans.

1904
02:27:56,577 --> 02:27:58,612
Put it down now.

1905
02:28:01,482 --> 02:28:03,617
That's pretty tricky
with that accent.

1906
02:28:03,684 --> 02:28:06,353
You oughta be on fucking TV
with that accent.

1907
02:28:08,755 --> 02:28:11,658
But what do you want
with the detonators?

1908
02:28:11,725 --> 02:28:13,861
I already used all the explosives.

1909
02:28:15,729 --> 02:28:16,797
Or did l?

1910
02:28:17,965 --> 02:28:19,266
I'm going to count to three.

1911
02:28:19,333 --> 02:28:21,268
Yeah. Like you did with Takagi?

1912
02:28:22,169 --> 02:28:22,703
Oops.

1913
02:28:24,238 --> 02:28:25,305
No bullets.

1914
02:28:25,372 --> 02:28:27,841
What do you think...
I'm fucking stupid, Hans?

1915
02:28:27,908 --> 02:28:28,775
You were saying?

1916
02:29:12,519 --> 02:29:12,920
Karl.

1917
02:29:13,687 --> 02:29:14,655
SchieB dem Fenster.

1918
02:29:20,727 --> 02:29:22,262
Shoot the glass!

1919
02:29:48,956 --> 02:29:50,157
Jesus Christ!

1920
02:30:13,547 --> 02:30:15,916
Smile, Karl.
We're back in business.

1921
02:30:18,051 --> 02:30:20,454
..is the lastresort ofdiplomacy,

1922
02:30:20,521 --> 02:30:22,956
then couldn't wejustas well say

1923
02:30:23,023 --> 02:30:25,359
that terrorism has an equal claim
on being that, too?

1924
02:30:25,926 --> 02:30:27,628
Tell me you got something.

1925
02:30:27,694 --> 02:30:30,864
McClane's name, badge number,
employment record, vital statistics,

1926
02:30:30,931 --> 02:30:32,065
and his family's home address

1927
02:30:32,132 --> 02:30:33,700
right here in LA.

1928
02:30:35,636 --> 02:30:36,236
Whoo!

1929
02:30:40,707 --> 02:30:41,642
Go to work.

1930
02:30:41,809 --> 02:30:43,243
Got it.

1931
02:30:52,953 --> 02:30:55,556
God, that man looks really pissed.

1932
02:30:57,424 --> 02:30:59,026
He's still alive.

1933
02:30:59,326 --> 02:31:00,127
What?

1934
02:31:01,228 --> 02:31:04,398
Only John can drive
somebody that crazy.

1935
02:31:16,276 --> 02:31:18,712
Hans, you better heat up that miracle

1936
02:31:18,779 --> 02:31:20,514
because we just broke through
on number six

1937
02:31:20,581 --> 02:31:22,749
and the electromagnetic
came down like a fucking anvil.

1938
02:31:22,816 --> 02:31:27,087
Have a look at what our friends
outside are doing and I'll be right up.

1939
02:31:29,022 --> 02:31:29,957
Hey, John.

1940
02:31:30,023 --> 02:31:31,959
John McClane, you still with us?

1941
02:31:32,025 --> 02:31:32,926
Yeah.

1942
02:31:33,560 --> 02:31:36,630
But all things being equal,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

1943
02:31:37,097 --> 02:31:38,799
Chalk up two more bad guys.

1944
02:31:39,066 --> 02:31:41,301
The boys down here
will be glad to hear that.

1945
02:31:42,002 --> 02:31:43,504
We gota poolgoing on you.

1946
02:31:43,570 --> 02:31:45,072
What kind of odds am I getting?

1947
02:31:45,139 --> 02:31:46,473
You don't want to know.

1948
02:31:46,540 --> 02:31:47,674
Put me down for 20.

1949
02:31:47,741 --> 02:31:48,675
I'm good for it.

1950
02:31:51,812 --> 02:31:53,947
Hey, pal, you gotflatfeet?

1951
02:31:55,949 --> 02:31:57,718
What the hell
are you talking about, man?

1952
02:31:57,784 --> 02:31:59,720
Something had
to get you offthe street.

1953
02:31:59,787 --> 02:32:00,754
What's the matter?

1954
02:32:00,821 --> 02:32:03,423
You don't thinkjockeyingpapers
across a desk is a noble effortfora cop?

1955
02:32:04,958 --> 02:32:05,959
No.

1956
02:32:08,729 --> 02:32:10,364
I had an accident.

1957
02:32:10,430 --> 02:32:12,266
The wayyou drive, I can see why.

1958
02:32:12,332 --> 02:32:12,933
What'd you do ?

1959
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,068
Run over your captain's foot
with the car?

1960
02:32:18,172 --> 02:32:19,139
I shot a kid.

1961
02:32:20,407 --> 02:32:21,875
He was 13 years old.

1962
02:32:22,876 --> 02:32:24,511
Oh, it was dark. I couldn'tsee him.

1963
02:32:24,578 --> 02:32:26,113
He hada raygun, lookedreal enough.

1964
02:32:28,715 --> 02:32:31,718
When you're a rookie, they teach you
everything about being a cop

1965
02:32:31,785 --> 02:32:33,287
except how to live with a mistake.

1966
02:32:36,490 --> 02:32:39,993
Anyway, ljust couldn'tbring myself
to drawmygun on anybody again.

1967
02:32:42,763 --> 02:32:43,831
Sorry, man.

1968
02:32:45,032 --> 02:32:47,201
Hey, man, how could you know?

1969
02:32:49,069 --> 02:32:50,537
I feel like shit anyway.

1970
02:32:52,940 --> 02:32:54,208
Well, then, this won't matter.

1971
02:32:54,274 --> 02:32:58,078
The LAPD is not calling the shots
down here any more.

1972
02:33:00,047 --> 02:33:00,981
The Feds?

1973
02:33:01,415 --> 02:33:02,282
You got it.

1974
02:33:03,550 --> 02:33:05,385
Those are the city engineers.

1975
02:33:06,353 --> 02:33:06,954
Wait.

1976
02:33:07,621 --> 02:33:09,123
They're going into the street circuits.

1977
02:33:09,189 --> 02:33:11,625
Those guys in the suits,
I don't know who they are.

1978
02:33:11,692 --> 02:33:12,426
That's the FBl.

1979
02:33:13,160 --> 02:33:16,029
They're ordering the others
to cut the building's power.

1980
02:33:16,096 --> 02:33:17,698
Regular as clockwork.

1981
02:33:19,166 --> 02:33:20,434
Or a time lock.

1982
02:33:20,834 --> 02:33:22,236
Precisely.

1983
02:33:22,302 --> 02:33:25,372
The circuits that cannot be cut
are cut automatically

1984
02:33:25,439 --> 02:33:27,641
in response to a terrorist incident.

1985
02:33:27,708 --> 02:33:29,409
You asked for miracles, Theo.

1986
02:33:29,476 --> 02:33:32,813
I give you the F-B-l.

1987
02:33:32,880 --> 02:33:34,414
I want the building shut down.

1988
02:33:34,481 --> 02:33:36,216
I got a problem. I got a switch...

1989
02:33:36,283 --> 02:33:39,486
I don't care
about your switch. I want it out. Dark!

1990
02:33:40,254 --> 02:33:41,488
You can't do it from here.

1991
02:33:41,555 --> 02:33:43,490
- Yeah, you could.
- It can't be done from here.

1992
02:33:43,557 --> 02:33:44,892
I could just... I got the radio...

1993
02:33:44,958 --> 02:33:47,761
You can't do it from here.
It's got to be done from downtown.

1994
02:33:47,828 --> 02:33:49,263
They've gotta take out
a whole city grid.

1995
02:33:49,329 --> 02:33:50,898
We're talking 10 square blocks.

1996
02:33:50,964 --> 02:33:52,432
Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.

1997
02:33:52,499 --> 02:33:54,568
It's Christmas Eve.
There's thousands of people.

1998
02:33:54,635 --> 02:33:55,969
You have to go wider.

1999
02:33:56,036 --> 02:34:00,107
- I need authorisation.
- How about the United States government?

2000
02:34:00,174 --> 02:34:01,842
Lose the grid, or you lose yourjob.

2001
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:08,215
- Yeah, Central?
- Yeah?

2002
02:34:08,282 --> 02:34:10,150
This is Walt down at Nakatomi.

2003
02:34:10,217 --> 02:34:14,154
Would it be possible for you
to turn off grid 212?

2004
02:34:14,221 --> 02:34:15,122
Are you crazy?!

2005
02:34:15,189 --> 02:34:17,324
Maybe I should call the Mayor.

2006
02:34:17,391 --> 02:34:19,860
No shit it's my ass.
I got a big problem here.

2007
02:34:19,927 --> 02:34:21,829
Shut it down now.

2008
02:34:24,465 --> 02:34:26,266
Emergency lighting activated.

2009
02:34:26,733 --> 02:34:29,002
Al, talk to me. What's going on here?

2010
02:34:29,069 --> 02:34:30,304
Ask the FBl.

2011
02:34:30,370 --> 02:34:32,573
They got the universal
terrorist playbook

2012
02:34:32,639 --> 02:34:34,575
and they're running it step by step.

2013
02:34:36,276 --> 02:34:37,811
It's gonna go. It's gonna go!

2014
02:34:39,246 --> 02:34:40,380
Yes!

2015
02:34:58,665 --> 02:34:59,833
Merry Christmas.

2016
02:35:01,068 --> 02:35:03,604
They must be pissing in their pants.

2017
02:35:03,670 --> 02:35:05,172
The Mayor is gonna have my ass.

2018
02:35:10,777 --> 02:35:11,845
Whoo!

2019
02:35:22,222 --> 02:35:24,024
What are we gonna do now ?

2020
02:35:24,091 --> 02:35:26,493
Arrest them for not paying
their electric bill?

2021
02:35:26,560 --> 02:35:27,995
We've shut them down.

2022
02:35:28,061 --> 02:35:30,798
We let them sweat for a while,
then we give them helicopters.

2023
02:35:30,864 --> 02:35:32,633
Right up the ass.

2024
02:35:34,701 --> 02:35:35,936
This is Agent Johnson.

2025
02:35:36,003 --> 02:35:37,104
No, the other one.

2026
02:35:37,171 --> 02:35:39,807
I want that air support ready
to lift off in five minutes.

2027
02:35:39,873 --> 02:35:42,643
Damn right. Fully armed.
We're on the way.

2028
02:35:47,381 --> 02:35:48,916
Oh, yes!

2029
02:35:50,284 --> 02:35:52,219
I wish to talk to the FBl.

2030
02:35:54,288 --> 02:35:55,989
This is Special Agent Johnson.

2031
02:35:56,056 --> 02:35:59,626
The State Departmenthas arranged
for the return ofyour comrades.

2032
02:35:59,693 --> 02:36:01,795
Helicopters are en route
as you requested.

2033
02:36:01,862 --> 02:36:02,930
I hearyou. We'll be ready.

2034
02:36:02,996 --> 02:36:05,666
By the time he figures out
what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.

2035
02:36:05,732 --> 02:36:07,234
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.

2036
02:36:07,301 --> 02:36:08,702
They'll spend a month
sifting through the rubble.

2037
02:36:08,769 --> 02:36:11,138
By the time they figure out
what went wrong,

2038
02:36:11,205 --> 02:36:13,707
we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20%.

2039
02:36:17,611 --> 02:36:18,812
Ah! Jeez!

2040
02:36:18,879 --> 02:36:19,713
Powell?

2041
02:36:20,380 --> 02:36:21,849
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

2042
02:36:23,250 --> 02:36:24,618
I'm here, John.

2043
02:36:25,986 --> 02:36:28,422
Listen, I'm starting to get
a bad feeling up here.

2044
02:36:28,889 --> 02:36:30,457
I want you to do something for me.

2045
02:36:30,524 --> 02:36:31,525
Um... ahem...

2046
02:36:32,759 --> 02:36:33,927
I want you to find my wife.

2047
02:36:33,994 --> 02:36:35,896
Don't ask me how.
By then you'll know how.

2048
02:36:35,963 --> 02:36:38,665
Uh, I want you
to tell her something.

2049
02:36:39,967 --> 02:36:41,301
I want you to tell her that...

2050
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:48,976
Tell her it took me
a while to figure out

2051
02:36:49,042 --> 02:36:50,611
what ajerk I've been

2052
02:36:51,178 --> 02:36:52,179
but, um...

2053
02:36:53,514 --> 02:36:54,314
that...

2054
02:36:57,417 --> 02:36:59,586
that when things started
to pan out for her

2055
02:36:59,653 --> 02:37:02,890
I should have been more supportive.

2056
02:37:03,257 --> 02:37:03,957
And, uh...

2057
02:37:05,159 --> 02:37:07,494
Ijustshouldhave been
behind hermore.

2058
02:37:09,730 --> 02:37:10,731
Oh, shit.

2059
02:37:12,866 --> 02:37:14,535
Tell her that, um

2060
02:37:15,269 --> 02:37:18,939
that she's the best thing
that ever happened to a bum like me.

2061
02:37:20,474 --> 02:37:23,243
She's heard me say "l love you"
a thousand times.

2062
02:37:24,178 --> 02:37:26,914
She never heard me say I'm sorry.

2063
02:37:27,414 --> 02:37:32,386
I want you to tell her that, Al.
Tell her that John said that he was sorry.

2064
02:37:33,487 --> 02:37:34,321
OK?

2065
02:37:35,088 --> 02:37:36,023
You got that, man?

2066
02:37:36,089 --> 02:37:37,925
Yeah, lgotit, John.

2067
02:37:38,959 --> 02:37:40,327
But you can tell her that yourself.

2068
02:37:40,394 --> 02:37:44,031
You just watch your ass
and you'll make it out. You hear me?

2069
02:37:44,431 --> 02:37:46,533
I guess that's up to the man upstairs.

2070
02:37:49,236 --> 02:37:50,437
John?

2071
02:37:51,104 --> 02:37:52,272
John?

2072
02:37:52,639 --> 02:37:55,476
What the fuck
were you doing upstairs, Hans?

2073
02:37:56,777 --> 02:37:57,611
John?

2074
02:37:57,678 --> 02:38:00,180
No, Al, listen.
Just lay offfor a while.

2075
02:38:01,782 --> 02:38:03,984
I gotta go check on something.

2076
02:38:06,053 --> 02:38:08,222
One minute, that's all I'm asking.

2077
02:38:08,288 --> 02:38:09,790
One minute to speak to them.

2078
02:38:09,857 --> 02:38:11,492
All right. Get back. Get back.

2079
02:38:11,558 --> 02:38:13,460
All right, look.

2080
02:38:13,527 --> 02:38:16,864
You let me in right now,
or I call the INS, comprende?

2081
02:38:18,932 --> 02:38:20,801
This is the last time
these kids are gonna have

2082
02:38:20,868 --> 02:38:22,569
to speak to their parents.

2083
02:38:23,904 --> 02:38:24,805
All right?

2084
02:38:25,072 --> 02:38:26,773
All right. Come on. Come on.

2085
02:38:34,848 --> 02:38:35,949
What were you doing, Hans?

2086
02:38:36,583 --> 02:38:37,785
What were you doing?

2087
02:38:55,669 --> 02:38:58,238
Jesus, Mary, mother of God.

2088
02:39:00,974 --> 02:39:03,076
Al, listen to me!
It's a double-cross!

2089
02:39:03,143 --> 02:39:04,445
The roof is wired to...

2090
02:39:06,613 --> 02:39:07,448
John?

2091
02:39:09,349 --> 02:39:10,584
John!

2092
02:39:10,851 --> 02:39:11,919
John, come in!

2093
02:39:12,352 --> 02:39:13,187
Did you get that?

2094
02:39:13,253 --> 02:39:15,656
Something about a double-cross.

2095
02:39:15,722 --> 02:39:17,591
Tell me about it.

2096
02:39:22,129 --> 02:39:23,931
We are both professionals.

2097
02:39:25,632 --> 02:39:26,967
This is personal.

2098
02:39:28,068 --> 02:39:29,169
Aww...

2099
02:39:45,853 --> 02:39:47,788
They're coming!

2100
02:39:48,222 --> 02:39:49,556
Choppers are coming.

2101
02:39:49,790 --> 02:39:52,459
Time to gather your flock,
Miss Gennero.

2102
02:39:52,526 --> 02:39:55,796
Your mom and dad
are veryimportantpeople.

2103
02:39:55,863 --> 02:39:57,431
They're verybrave people.

2104
02:39:57,498 --> 02:40:00,701
Is there somethingyou'dlike
to say to them, ifthey're watching?

2105
02:40:00,767 --> 02:40:03,303
Come home.

2106
02:40:10,077 --> 02:40:11,145
Mrs McClane.

2107
02:40:13,747 --> 02:40:16,416
How nice to make your acquaintance.

2108
02:40:18,986 --> 02:40:20,587
On your feet, everyone! To the roof!

2109
02:40:20,654 --> 02:40:22,790
Lock them up there
and come right back.

2110
02:40:44,378 --> 02:40:46,780
You should have heard
your brother squeal

2111
02:40:46,847 --> 02:40:49,383
when I broke his fucking neck!

2112
02:40:51,985 --> 02:40:53,887
What do you figure the breakage?

2113
02:40:53,954 --> 02:40:55,689
I figure we take out the terrorists,

2114
02:40:55,756 --> 02:40:58,125
Iose 20, 25% ofthe hostages, tops.

2115
02:40:58,759 --> 02:41:00,694
I can live with that.

2116
02:41:00,761 --> 02:41:01,862
Get this thing on the deck.

2117
02:41:01,929 --> 02:41:04,698
They're expecting transports,
not gun ships.

2118
02:41:14,308 --> 02:41:15,776
Move it! Come on! Move!

2119
02:41:15,843 --> 02:41:17,111
Come on! Come on!

2120
02:41:17,177 --> 02:41:18,178
Move it!

2121
02:41:19,146 --> 02:41:20,147
Go! Move!

2122
02:41:23,250 --> 02:41:24,017
Theo.

2123
02:41:24,451 --> 02:41:25,719
A little bonus for us.

2124
02:41:25,786 --> 02:41:27,387
Please, sit down. Sit down!

2125
02:41:27,454 --> 02:41:29,623
A policeman's wife
might come in handy.

2126
02:41:29,690 --> 02:41:31,692
McClane, I have some news for you.

2127
02:41:32,526 --> 02:41:33,560
McClane?

2128
02:41:42,736 --> 02:41:43,770
Move!

2129
02:41:45,906 --> 02:41:46,507
Come on!

2130
02:41:56,784 --> 02:41:58,619
Motherfucker! I'll kill you!

2131
02:42:01,755 --> 02:42:02,623
Armed.

2132
02:42:02,990 --> 02:42:04,625
- The truck?
- The truck.

2133
02:42:10,364 --> 02:42:13,600
After all your posturing,
all your little speeches,

2134
02:42:13,667 --> 02:42:15,569
you're nothing but a common thief.

2135
02:42:15,736 --> 02:42:17,738
I am an exceptional thief,
Mrs McClane.

2136
02:42:17,805 --> 02:42:19,072
And since I'm moving up
to kidnapping,

2137
02:42:19,139 --> 02:42:20,741
you should be more polite.

2138
02:42:26,380 --> 02:42:28,081
You motherfucker,
I'm gonna kill you!

2139
02:42:28,148 --> 02:42:30,918
I'm gonna fuckin' cook you,
and I'm gonna fuckin' eat you!

2140
02:42:49,002 --> 02:42:50,671
I don't like this, Sarge.

2141
02:42:56,844 --> 02:43:01,582
Yee-hah!
Just like fucking Saigon, eh, Slick?

2142
02:43:02,816 --> 02:43:05,119
I was in Junior High, dickhead.

2143
02:43:27,441 --> 02:43:28,609
Where's Holly?

2144
02:43:28,675 --> 02:43:29,843
Where's Holly Gennero?

2145
02:43:29,910 --> 02:43:31,612
Holly Gennero? Where's Holly?

2146
02:43:31,678 --> 02:43:33,147
Where's Holly? Where is she?

2147
02:43:33,213 --> 02:43:34,381
- They took her!
- Where?

2148
02:43:34,448 --> 02:43:35,415
The vault!

2149
02:43:35,482 --> 02:43:37,017
- Where is the vault?
- The 30th floor!

2150
02:43:37,084 --> 02:43:38,619
They just took her!

2151
02:43:38,786 --> 02:43:39,686
Get downstairs!

2152
02:43:39,753 --> 02:43:41,755
The whole fucking roof
is wired to blow!

2153
02:43:41,822 --> 02:43:43,090
Get down!

2154
02:43:43,157 --> 02:43:45,225
Get down!
Get the fuck downstairs!

2155
02:43:46,994 --> 02:43:49,296
They made us, Bureau.
Terrorist shooting hostages.

2156
02:43:49,363 --> 02:43:50,731
Break left!

2157
02:43:55,736 --> 02:43:57,070
Nail that sucker!

2158
02:44:03,577 --> 02:44:06,013
I'm on your side, you assholes!

2159
02:44:06,079 --> 02:44:08,582
Swing around again!
I'll bag this little bastard.

2160
02:44:23,697 --> 02:44:25,165
What the fuck...

2161
02:44:26,733 --> 02:44:29,036
Oh, John,
what the fuck are you doing?

2162
02:44:29,103 --> 02:44:31,405
How the fuck
did you get into this shit?

2163
02:44:39,413 --> 02:44:42,149
There's something wrong!
They're coming back down!

2164
02:44:42,216 --> 02:44:43,951
- Blow the roof.
- But Karl's up there!

2165
02:44:44,017 --> 02:44:45,152
Blow the roof!

2166
02:44:47,754 --> 02:44:50,057
I promise I will never even think

2167
02:44:50,124 --> 02:44:52,526
about going up
in a tall building again.

2168
02:44:55,195 --> 02:44:57,064
Oh, God, please don't let me die!

2169
02:46:10,370 --> 02:46:12,372
Holy Christ!

2170
02:46:13,307 --> 02:46:15,409
We're gonna need
some more FBI guys, I guess.

2171
02:46:25,619 --> 02:46:27,054
Jesus fucking Christ!

2172
02:46:27,821 --> 02:46:28,722
Fuck!

2173
02:46:48,242 --> 02:46:50,277
What the fuck is going on?

2174
02:46:51,779 --> 02:46:54,648
What are you gonna do?
Sit here while the building falls down?

2175
02:47:01,321 --> 02:47:02,022
Shit!

2176
02:47:02,089 --> 02:47:03,590
All right!

2177
02:47:04,758 --> 02:47:05,726
Hey! Hey!

2178
02:47:06,493 --> 02:47:07,928
Hang on, baby.

2179
02:47:07,995 --> 02:47:09,263
Hang on, honey.

2180
02:47:10,097 --> 02:47:10,931
Oh, God.

2181
02:47:47,034 --> 02:47:48,402
Hans!

2182
02:48:00,013 --> 02:48:01,415
Jesus.

2183
02:48:01,482 --> 02:48:04,084
Hi, honey.

2184
02:48:20,934 --> 02:48:24,104
So that's what this is all about?
A fucking robbery?

2185
02:48:24,471 --> 02:48:25,439
Put down the gun.

2186
02:48:26,807 --> 02:48:28,642
Why'd you have to nuke
the whole building, Hans?

2187
02:48:28,709 --> 02:48:31,145
Well, when you steal $600,
you can just disappear.

2188
02:48:31,211 --> 02:48:33,614
When you steal 600 million,
they will find you

2189
02:48:33,680 --> 02:48:35,516
unless they think
you're already dead.

2190
02:48:35,582 --> 02:48:37,284
Put down the gun.

2191
02:48:45,659 --> 02:48:46,994
Nein. This is mine.

2192
02:48:49,596 --> 02:48:51,064
You got me.

2193
02:48:51,131 --> 02:48:53,367
Still the cowboy, Mr McClane.

2194
02:48:53,434 --> 02:48:54,768
Americans... all alike.

2195
02:48:54,835 --> 02:48:58,005
This time, John Wayne does not walk off
into the sunset with Grace Kelly.

2196
02:48:58,071 --> 02:48:59,540
That was Gary Cooper, asshole.

2197
02:48:59,606 --> 02:49:01,041
Enough jokes.

2198
02:49:01,108 --> 02:49:03,410
You'd have made a pretty
good cowboy yourself, Hans.

2199
02:49:03,477 --> 02:49:07,214
Oh, yes. What was it
you said to me before?

2200
02:49:07,281 --> 02:49:10,284
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

2201
02:49:27,201 --> 02:49:27,568
Holly!

2202
02:49:32,473 --> 02:49:33,674
Happy trails, Hans.

2203
02:49:38,078 --> 02:49:39,379
- Aah!
- Holly.

2204
02:50:09,409 --> 02:50:10,911
I hope that's not a hostage.

2205
02:50:33,634 --> 02:50:36,837
Gimme water hook-ups
for engine companies 5, 3, 9, 6.

2206
02:50:39,773 --> 02:50:41,074
Over here. It's a better angle.

2207
02:50:41,141 --> 02:50:42,676
Let's give them a hand.

2208
02:50:44,812 --> 02:50:47,247
Keep it going, now. Keep it going.

2209
02:50:51,285 --> 02:50:54,188
- Come on. We're going to miss it!
- OK. Hand me my notes!

2210
02:51:12,606 --> 02:51:15,876
What was it like in there?
How did they treat you?

2211
02:51:52,846 --> 02:51:54,248
Al, this is my wife Holly.

2212
02:51:54,314 --> 02:51:55,849
Holly Gennero.

2213
02:51:56,450 --> 02:51:57,851
Holly McClane.

2214
02:51:57,918 --> 02:51:59,253
Hello, Holly.

2215
02:51:59,319 --> 02:52:00,888
You got yourself a good man.

2216
02:52:00,954 --> 02:52:02,556
You take good care of him.

2217
02:52:03,090 --> 02:52:04,291
McClane!

2218
02:52:04,358 --> 02:52:06,527
McClane, I want a debriefing!

2219
02:52:06,593 --> 02:52:08,729
You got some things
to answer for, mister.

2220
02:52:08,796 --> 02:52:10,197
Ellis' murder, for one thing.

2221
02:52:10,264 --> 02:52:13,267
Property damage,
interfering with police business.

2222
02:52:45,566 --> 02:52:48,035
Two ofyou go inside
and see ifthere's anybody else!

2223
02:52:56,643 --> 02:52:58,712
No. This one's with me.

2224
02:53:06,653 --> 02:53:07,955
Mr McClane, Mr McClane!

2225
02:53:08,021 --> 02:53:10,057
Now that it's all over,
after this incredible ordeal,

2226
02:53:10,124 --> 02:53:11,692
what are your feelings?

2227
02:53:15,896 --> 02:53:17,030
Well, well, well.

2228
02:53:17,097 --> 02:53:20,501
- Merry Christmas, Argyle.
- Merry Christmas.

2229
02:53:23,337 --> 02:53:24,171
Did you get that?

2230
02:53:24,238 --> 02:53:25,839
Let me through.

2231
02:53:26,240 --> 02:53:29,076
If this is their idea of Christmas,
I gotta be here for New Year's.
