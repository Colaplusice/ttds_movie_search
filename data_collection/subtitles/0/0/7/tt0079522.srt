00:00:37,784 --> 00:00:39,824
<i>"Chapter one. "</i>

2
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:44,164
<i>"He adored New York City. 
He idolised it all out of proportion. "</i>

3
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,036
<i>Uh, no. Make that "He romanticised it
all out of proportion. "</i>

4
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,626
<i>"To him, 
no matter what the season was, </i>

5
00:00:51,756 --> 00:00:55,006
<i>this was still a town
that existed in black and white</i>

6
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:58,420
<i>and pulsated to the great tunes
of George Gershwin. "</i>

7
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:01,093
<i>Uh... no. Let me start this over. </i>

8
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:03,347
<i>"Chapter one. "</i>

9
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:07,391
<i>"He was too romantic about Manhattan, 
as he was about everything else. "</i>

10
00:01:07,522 --> 00:01:11,140
<i>"He thrived on the hustle, bustle
of the crowds and the traffic. "</i>

11
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:13,518
<i>"To him, New York
meant beautiful women</i>

12
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:17,485
<i>and street-smart guys
who seemed to know all the angles. "</i>

13
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:20,901
<i>Ah, corny. Too corny
for a man of my taste. </i>

14
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:23,361
<i>Let me... try and make it more profound. </i>

15
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:27,280
<i>"Chapter one. He adored New York City. "</i>

16
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:31,746
<i>"To him, it was a metaphor
for the decay of contemporary culture. "</i>

17
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,043
<i>"The same lack of integrity to cause so
many people to take the easy way out... </i>

18
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:39,046
<i>... was rapidly turning the town
of his dreams..."</i>

19
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:43,508
<i>No, it's gonna be too preachy. I mean, 
face it, I wanna sell some books here. </i>

20
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:46,476
<i>"Chapter one. He adored New York City, </i>

21
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:51,015
<i>although to him it was a metaphor
for the decay of contemporary culture. "</i>

22
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,523
<i>"How hard it was to exist in a society
desensitised by drugs, loud music, </i>

23
00:01:56,654 --> 00:01:59,489
<i>television, crime, garbage..."</i>

24
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:01,822
<i>Too angry. I don't wanna be angry. </i>

25
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:04,276
<i>"Chapter one. "</i>

26
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:07,448
<i>"He was as tough and romantic
as the city he loved. "</i>

27
00:02:07,582 --> 00:02:12,327
<i>"Behind his black-rimmed glasses was
the coiled sexual power of a jungle cat. "</i>

28
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:14,039
<i>I love this. </i>

29
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:17,623
<i>"New York was his town
and it always would be. "</i>

30
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:18,786
I think the essence of art is to provide
a kind of working-through situation,

31
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:22,456
so that you can get in touch
with feelings you didn't know you had.

32
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:26,921
Talent is luck.
The important thing in life is courage.

33
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:31,348
- They've had this argument for 20 years.
- Listen to this example.

34
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:36,433
If the four of us are walking home over
the bridge and a person was drowning,

35
00:04:36,564 --> 00:04:38,603
would we have the nerve...

36
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:42,564
Would one of us have the nerve
to dive into the icy water and save them?

37
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:44,521
It's a key question.

38
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:47,442
l, of course, can't swim,
so I never have to face it.

39
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:50,365
Oh... God.

40
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:53,076
Which of us?

41
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:56,917
- You want a little more?
- No.

42
00:04:57,042 --> 00:05:00,874
Mm. Oh, man. That is so great.

43
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:02,831
You don't smoke.

44
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:07,508
I know I don't smoke. I don't inhale
because it gives you cancer, but

45
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:13,047
<i>I look so incredibly handsome
with a cigarette that I can't not hold one.</i>

46
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:16,724
You like the way I look?

47
00:05:16,854 --> 00:05:18,264
Provocative.

48
00:05:18,397 --> 00:05:22,311
- I'm getting through to you?
- Yup. You have to excuse me a sec.

49
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:26,813
Jesus, she's gorgeous.

50
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,779
But she's 17 7.

51
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:32,198
I'm 42 and she's 17 7.

52
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:37,325
I'm... I'm older than her father.
Can you believe that?

53
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,911
I'm dating a girl
wherein I can beat up her father.

54
00:05:41,044 --> 00:05:44,045
That's the first time
that ever occurred in my life.

55
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:48,419
- He's drunk.
- You're drunk. You should never drink.

56
00:05:48,552 --> 00:05:52,135
Did I tell you... that my ex-wife...

57
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:55,964
- Who, Tina?
- My second ex-wife

58
00:05:56,852 --> 00:05:59,936
is writing a book about
our marriage and the break-up.

59
00:06:00,063 --> 00:06:03,313
- That's really tacky.
- It's really depressing, you know.

60
00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:08,068
She's gonna give all those details out,
all my little idiosyncrasies,

61
00:06:08,196 --> 00:06:10,687
and my quirks and mannerisms, and...

62
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:14,701
Not that I have
anything to hide because, you know...

63
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:19,371
But there are a few disgusting
little moments that I regret.

64
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:22,417
It's just gossip.
Gossip is the new pornography.

65
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:26,043
- You should never let me drink.
- I know.

66
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:28,415
<i>You should never let yourself drink.</i>

67
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,219
We oughta go
cos I've got an exam tomorrow.

68
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:33,800
Oh, do you? The kid's gotta get up...

69
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:39,010
She's got homework.
I'm dating a girl who does homework.

70
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:42,554
What is it? What's the matter with you?

71
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:46,687
You... you... Where are you now?
Your mind is like a million miles away.

72
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:48,858
I have something I wanna say.

73
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:51,905
l, uh, I just didn't know
quite how to... get into it.

74
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:54,071
Um, l, uh...

75
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:59,364
About seven or eight weeks ago
I went to this dinner party

76
00:06:59,498 --> 00:07:01,537
and I met a woman there.

77
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:04,617
And...

78
00:07:04,753 --> 00:07:09,379
- And I've got kind of involved with her.
- You're kidding?

79
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:13,208
It started out very casually.
I mean, we had lunch a couple of times.

80
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:17,805
And now it's, you know, it's getting out of
hand and I don't know what to do about it.

81
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:20,056
I mean, I'm... It's scary.

82
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:23,221
Well, who is she? What are the details?

83
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:25,394
Well, she's a journalist.

84
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,315
She's very...

85
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:29,898
- Is she married, too?
- No, no.

86
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:32,068
She's very beautiful.

87
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:36,445
She's very kind of
nervous, high-strung, illusive.

88
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:39,032
Great. It sounds wonderful.

89
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:43,539
<i>Oh, she is wonderful.
I mean, she's on my mind all the time.</i>

90
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:48,459
What are you telling me? That your
marriage is... I mean, how serious is it?

91
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:53,336
I don't know, but it's pretty serious.

92
00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:56,919
- But you haven't said anything to Emily?
- No! God, no.

93
00:07:57,055 --> 00:08:00,554
It's amazing. I'm stunned
because, of all the people I know,

94
00:08:00,684 --> 00:08:04,812
I always thought for sure that you
and Emily had one of the best marriages.

95
00:08:04,938 --> 00:08:07,310
We do! I mean, I love her.

96
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,848
- But you're seeing...
- I know it.

97
00:08:09,984 --> 00:08:12,772
But in all the years
that we've been married

98
00:08:12,904 --> 00:08:17,151
I've had, what... one or two
very minor things with other women.

99
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:23,238
I mean, very... I hate the whole idea. I hate
myself when I'm doing this sort of thing.

100
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:26,457
But this is just, you know...
This is not like that.

101
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:30,036
It's terrible. Listen,
you shouldn't ask me for advice.

102
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:35,213
When it comes to relationships, I'm the
winner of the August Strindberg Award.

103
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:39,970
Well, I don't think 17 7 is too young.
Beside that, she's a bright girl.

104
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:43,467
You'll get no argument from me.
I think she's terrific.

105
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:46,851
<i>He could do a lot worse.
He has done a lot worse.</i>

106
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,221
I just think he's wasting his life.

107
00:08:49,357 --> 00:08:52,441
He writes that crap for television.

108
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:57,438
Yale, have you ever thought
any more about having kids?

109
00:08:58,366 --> 00:09:00,489
Oh, my God. Kids.

110
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:04,533
Listen, I've gotta get this book finished.
It's never gonna get done.

111
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:07,997
I've gotta get the money
to get this magazine started, huh?

112
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:09,750
Kids...

113
00:09:09,877 --> 00:09:13,543
We always talk about moving to
Connecticut. You could do it there.

114
00:09:13,673 --> 00:09:16,128
- Connecticut.
- Yeah.

115
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:19,509
I can't go to Connecticut. It's not practical.

116
00:09:19,637 --> 00:09:21,677
All my stuff's here.

117
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:24,297
My work's here.
It's just the wrong time.

118
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:27,933
What about Isaac?
We can't abandon him, you know?

119
00:09:28,062 --> 00:09:32,107
He can't function anywhere
other than New York, you know that.

120
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,273
Very Freudian.

121
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,205
- Are you writing a book on our marriage?
- Leave me alone.

122
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:59,717
- Are you writing about our break-up?
- We've said all that needs to be said.

123
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:02,714
I know you are because
I have a friend at Random House.

124
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:06,132
- I'm free to do as I please.
- Yeah, but this affects me.

125
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:09,968
So you're gonna tell everybody
everything? Our life, our sexual life?

126
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:11,515
Do you spy on me?

127
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:15,312
No. I was at a party and a guy said
he read an advance chapter

128
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:19,191
of a book my wife was writing,
and it was hot stuff. He said that!

129
00:10:19,322 --> 00:10:23,236
- I spilled wine on my pants.
- I don't care to discuss it.

130
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:25,905
- You won't discuss it. How's Willie?
- Fine.

131
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:30,414
Well, give me some details. Does he
play baseball? Wear dresses? What?

132
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:35,084
He doesn't wear dresses. You'll find out
the details when it's your turn to see him.

133
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:38,213
Don't write this book.
It's a humiliating experience.

134
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,666
It's an honest account of our break-up.

135
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:44,005
Jesus, everybody that knows us
is gonna know everything.

136
00:10:44,138 --> 00:10:46,380
Look at you. You're so threatened.

137
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:51,510
I'm not threatened because I was not
the immoral, psychotic, promiscuous one.

138
00:10:51,645 --> 00:10:54,018
I hope I didn't leave out anything.

139
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:04,814
Are you telling me that... that... that I'm...
that you had three affairs before me?

140
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,450
That's really hard to believe.
It's mind-boggling.

141
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,707
When I was your age, I was still being
tucked in by my grandparents.

142
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:16,997
Well, they were really immature boys.
They were nothing like you.

143
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:19,169
No? What does that mean?

144
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:22,418
Well, I told you before.
I think I'm in love with you.

145
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:24,840
Hey, don't get carried away, OK?

146
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,505
This is... This is a terrific thing
- Move over-you know.

147
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:34,311
And we're having a great time, but you're
a kid and I never want you to forget that.

148
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:37,392
You're gonna meet
a lot of terrific men in your life

149
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:39,683
and, you know, I want you to enjoy me.

150
00:11:39,818 --> 00:11:43,899
My wry sense of humour
and astonishing sexual technique,

151
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:48,076
but never forget that you've...
you've got your whole life ahead of you.

152
00:11:48,202 --> 00:11:50,408
Don't you have any feelings for me?

153
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:54,120
How can you ask that?
I've got nothing but feelings for you,

154
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,915
but you don't wanna get hung up
with one person at your age.

155
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:01,248
It's... charming, you know.

156
00:12:01,382 --> 00:12:04,418
Erotic. No question about that.

157
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:08,964
As long as the cops don't burst in, I think
we're gonna break a couple of records.

158
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:12,467
But you can't, uh, you can't...
It's not a good thing.

159
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:16,930
You should think of me sort of
as a detour on the highway of life.

160
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:20,729
- So get dressed because you gotta go.
- Don't you want me to stay over?

161
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:23,101
I don't want you to get in the habit

162
00:12:23,237 --> 00:12:28,278
because first you stay one night, then
two nights, and then you're living here.

163
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:31,113
- That doesn't sound too bad.
- It's not a great idea.

164
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:34,779
You won't like it, believe me.
I'm tough to get along with.

165
00:12:34,915 --> 00:12:39,791
Tomorrow we'll go to the cinema and I'll
show you the Veronica Lake movie. OK?

166
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,585
OK. Veronica Lake's
the pin-up with the red hair?

167
00:12:43,715 --> 00:12:47,630
<i>No, that's Rita Hayworth.
Do we have to go over this all the time?</i>

168
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:51,545
- Rita who?
- Rita Hayworth. Are you joking with me?

169
00:12:51,682 --> 00:12:56,427
Course I'm joking! You think I'm unaware
of any event pre-Paul McCartney.

170
00:12:59,064 --> 00:13:02,314
- I find these photographs interesting.
- Yes, so do I.

171
00:13:02,442 --> 00:13:06,108
- Do you ever use the camera I got you?
- Oh, yeah, I use it all the time.

172
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:09,903
I was taking pictures in our drama class.
It's fun, really neat.

173
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:12,868
<i>You know you sound like
the mouse in Tom And Jerry. </i>

174
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:14,405
Are you kidding me?

175
00:13:14,538 --> 00:13:18,121
- You should talk! You've a whiny voice!
- You sound like the mouse.

176
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,077
Well, thanks.

177
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,330
I know, I'm a whiner.

178
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:27,710
- What are you doing here?
- Hi.

179
00:13:27,843 --> 00:13:30,797
- How long have you been here?
- We were talking about you.

180
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:35,390
That's hilarious. Wh... What... Were you
walking around behind us or what?

181
00:13:35,517 --> 00:13:38,767
- How are you? Hi.
- Good. That's funny. We were talking...

182
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:41,849
We're gonna go to
the Shakespeare In The Park thing.

183
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:44,021
Oh, yeah, right. I wanna do that.

184
00:13:44,151 --> 00:13:47,733
Oh, this is my friend.
Mary Wilke, Isaac Davis and Tracy.

185
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:49,939
- How do you do?
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

186
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:51,354
You, too.

187
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:53,116
- Hello.
- Hi.

188
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:56,279
We were downstairs.
We saw the photography exhibition.

189
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:59,034
- Absolutely incredible.
- It's really good.

190
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,624
Really?

191
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:03,372
- The photographs downstairs?
- Yes.

192
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:08,664
- Great. Absolutely great. Did you?
- No, I really felt it was very derivative.

193
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,343
To me it looked like it was straight out of
Diane Arbus, but it had none of the wit.

194
00:14:13,472 --> 00:14:17,172
Well, we didn't like it
as much as the Plexiglas sculpture.

195
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:19,100
You liked the Plexiglas?

196
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:25,348
- You didn't like the Plexiglas either?
- Ah, that's interesting. Nah, no...

197
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:29,018
It was a lot better than
that... that steel cube. Did you see it?

198
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:33,234
- Oh, yeah. That was the worst.
- Now that was brilliant to me.

199
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:35,406
- The cube was brilliant?
- Yes.

200
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:38,620
To me it was very textural.
You know what I mean?

201
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:43,492
It was perfectly integrated and it had a...
a marvellous kind of negative capability.

202
00:14:43,627 --> 00:14:45,666
The rest of the stuff was bullshit.

203
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:52,628
- You wanna see the Sol Lewitt?
- Sure. That'd be fun.

204
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,171
You wanna see that?

205
00:14:54,304 --> 00:14:57,839
<i>He opens at the Modern soon. I was
gonna do a piece on Sol for Insights. </i>

206
00:14:57,974 --> 00:15:00,928
Do you know that magazine?
It's a little magazine.

207
00:15:01,061 --> 00:15:05,189
They're such schmucks up there.
Really mired in Thirties radicalism.

208
00:15:05,315 --> 00:15:07,687
- What do you do, Tracy?
- I go to high school.

209
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:12,775
Oh, really. Really. Somewhere Nabokov
is smiling, if you know what I mean.

210
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:17,363
LeWitt is overrated. In fact,
he may be a candidate for the academy.

211
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:18,822
Right!

212
00:15:18,953 --> 00:15:23,200
Mary and I have invented the Academy
of the Overrated for such notables as

213
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,499
- Gustav Mahler,
- Isak Dinesen and Carl Jung.

214
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:30,127
- Scott Fitzgerald.
- Lenny Bruce. Can't forget him, can we?

215
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:34,040
- How about Norman Mailer?
- I think those people are all terrific.

216
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:37,925
- Who was that guy you had?
- I didn't. It was yours. Heinrich B?l.

217
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:40,725
- Overrated?
- Don't wanna leave out Heinrich.

218
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,302
Gee, what about Mozart?
You guys don't wanna leave out Mozart.

219
00:15:44,437 --> 00:15:48,269
<i>- Well, how about Vincent Van Goch? 
- She said "Van Goch"?! </i>

220
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,688
- Or Ingmar Bergman?
- You'll get in trouble.

221
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:53,985
Bergman? Bergman's the only genius
in cinema today, I think.

222
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:55,940
He's a big Bergman fan.

223
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:59,906
God, you're so the opposite.
You write that fabulous television show.

224
00:16:00,036 --> 00:16:02,871
It's so funny and
his view is so Scandinavian.

225
00:16:02,997 --> 00:16:06,034
It's bleak, my God.
I mean, all that Kierkegaard, right?

226
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:11,209
Real adolescent, fashionable pessimism.
I mean, the silence. God's silence.

227
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,678
OK, OK, OK. I mean, I loved it when I was
at Radcliffe, but, all right, you outgrow it.

228
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:20,172
Get her away from me. I don't think
I can take too much more of her.

229
00:16:20,306 --> 00:16:22,797
- She's really a cr...
- No. Don't you guys see?

230
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:26,599
It is the dignifying of one's
psychological and sexual hang-ups

231
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:30,597
by attaching them to these
grandiose, philosophical issues?

232
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:33,983
- Here we are.
- Listen, it was very nice meeting you.

233
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:36,982
It was a pleasure
and a sincere sensation,

234
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:40,069
but we have to go.
We gotta do some shopping. I forgot.

235
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:43,237
Hey, listen, I don't even
wanna have this conversation.

236
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:47,832
I'm just from Philadelphia, you know.
I mean, we believe in God so... OK?

237
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,580
What the hell does that mean?
What do you mean?

238
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:53,997
- Well, that...
- "I'm from Philadelphia. I believe in God."

239
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:57,002
Does this make any sense to you?

240
00:16:58,052 --> 00:17:00,508
What a creep. Could you believe her?

241
00:17:00,638 --> 00:17:03,176
- I mean, she was really...
- She seemed nervous.

242
00:17:03,307 --> 00:17:07,850
Nervous? She was overbearing. She was,
you know, terrible! She was all cerebral.

243
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:12,391
Where the hell does a little Radcliffe
tootsie come off rating Scott Fitzgerald,

244
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:16,024
- Gustav Mahler and Heinrich B?l?
- Why are you getting so mad?

245
00:17:16,154 --> 00:17:19,772
Because I don't like that
pseudo-intellectual garbage.

246
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:23,739
<i>"Van Goch!" Did you hear that? She said
Van Goch.  Like an Arab she spoke.</i>

247
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,697
One more remark about Bergman, and I'd
have knocked her other contact lens out.

248
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,877
- Is she Yale's mistress?
- That will never cease to mystify me.

249
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:38,045
I mean, he's got a wonderful wife
and he prefers to... to diddle this yo-yo.

250
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:40,880
But he was always a sucker
for those kind of women.

251
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:45,590
The kind that would involve him
in discussions of existential reality.

252
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:49,010
They probably sit on the floor
with wine and cheese,

253
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:52,596
and mispronounce
"allegorical" and "didacticism".

254
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:55,401
I get the feeling that Yale really likes her.

255
00:17:55,526 --> 00:17:58,527
Well, I don't believe
in extramarital relationships.

256
00:17:58,654 --> 00:18:02,652
I think people should mate for life
like pigeons or Catholics.

257
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:07,746
I don't know. Maybe people weren't
meant to have one deep relationship.

258
00:18:07,872 --> 00:18:12,166
Maybe we're meant to have a series
of relationships of different lengths.

259
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:16,243
- That's gone out of date.
- Don't tell me what's gone out of date.

260
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,963
You're 17 7. You were brought up
on drugs and television and the pill.

261
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:22,666
I... I was World War II.
I was in the trenches.

262
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:26,504
- You were eight in World War II.
- Right. I was never in the trenches.

263
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,092
I was caught right in the middle.
It was a very tough position.

264
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:32,220
Get the groceries, will you?

265
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:37,149
<i>Good morning and welcome to
Human Beings Wow! </i>

266
00:18:37,276 --> 00:18:41,190
We're talking this evening with Gregory
and Caroline Payne Whitney Smith,

267
00:18:41,322 --> 00:18:43,361
close friends of the Carter family.

268
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:46,575
We're normal people.
Just like you, we're in debt.

269
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:49,495
Except that Mrs Payne Whitney Smith
is a catatonic.

270
00:18:49,622 --> 00:18:53,121
Well, we don't consider her
a catatonic, just quiet.

271
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:57,837
Jesus, this is the worst.
This is really embarrassing to me.

272
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:03,836
- I mean, I... This is so antiseptic...
- No, wrong. That's very chancy material.

273
00:19:03,969 --> 00:19:07,385
- How do you see this as chancy?
- Who fights more with the censor?

274
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:11,761
What has the censor got to do with it?
There's no substance to the comedy.

275
00:19:11,894 --> 00:19:16,022
- You don't find this insightful?
- Worse than not insightful. It's not funny.

276
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:18,935
- There's not a legitimate laugh.
- That's funny.

277
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:22,484
- Look at the audience.
- You're going by audience reaction?

278
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:24,652
This is an audience raised on TV.

279
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:27,985
Their standards have been lowered
over the years.

280
00:19:28,118 --> 00:19:32,827
They watch their sets and the gamma
rays eat the white cells of their brains out.

281
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:36,824
- I quit. I can't write this any more.
- Relax. Take a lude.

282
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,836
I don't want a lude. All you do is drop
ludes, then Percodans and angel dust.

283
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:45,957
Naturally, it seems funny.
Anything would if you're...

284
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:49,879
You should abandon the show
and open a pharmaceutical house. I quit.

285
00:19:50,015 --> 00:19:51,842
Ike, you're being silly.

286
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,057
<i>We've talked to them about that. </i>

287
00:19:56,188 --> 00:19:58,644
<i>- Don't break her neck. 
- I won't. That's fine. </i>

288
00:19:58,774 --> 00:20:01,099
What did I do? I made a terrible mistake.

289
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:05,398
- It's the first smart thing you've done.
- I've screwed myself up completely.

290
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:10,323
For about 30 seconds I was a big hero,
and now it's directly to unemployment.

291
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:12,694
If you need money, I'll take care of it.

292
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,367
That's not the point.
I got enough for a year.

293
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:18,416
If I live like Mahatma Gandhi, I'm fine.

294
00:20:18,544 --> 00:20:22,493
My accountant says I did this
at a very bad time. My stocks are down.

295
00:20:22,631 --> 00:20:25,751
I'm cash poor or something.
I got no cash flow.

296
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:30,427
I'm not liquid, something's not flowing.
They got a language all their own.

297
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:34,138
We discussed this. It's difficult
to live here without a big income.

298
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:39,179
Yeah, plus I got two alimonies and
child support. You know, I gotta cut down.

299
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:41,395
I'll have to give up my apartment.

300
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:44,941
I'm not gonna be able to
play tennis, pick checks up at dinner,

301
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,109
or take the Southampton house.

302
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:53,904
Plus I'll probably have to give
my parents less money. It'll kill my father.

303
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:57,204
He's not gonna be able to get
as good a seat in the synagogue.

304
00:20:57,332 --> 00:21:00,286
He'll be in the back, away from God,
far from the action.

305
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:02,458
Have you said anything to Tracy?

306
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:08,708
What is it... I gotta get out of that situation.
She's a young girl. What am I...? I'm...

307
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:11,679
You know, it's ridiculous. I mean, I...

308
00:21:12,597 --> 00:21:16,132
What happens if the year goes by
and my book doesn't come out?

309
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:19,933
Your book is gonna come out.
Your book is gonna be wonderful.

310
00:21:20,063 --> 00:21:24,143
The worst thing that can happen is
you'll learn something about yourself.

311
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:29,566
<i>Listen, I'm really proud of you.
I mean, this is a very good move.</i>

312
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:32,065
This is a wonderful turnout.

313
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:35,987
The Museum of Modern Art
has been very generous.

314
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:39,572
And the proof of the strength
of the Equal Rights Amendment

315
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:44,785
is that so many of you who would
never do it before put on black tie tonight.

316
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:52,375
We love you for it.
We need you and you've come through.

317
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,596
And now no more talk. Enjoy yourselves.

318
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,345
Hi. What are you doing here?

319
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,232
Congratulations on your book.
It was terrific.

320
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,647
- Oh, thanks.
- Absolutely terrific.

321
00:22:07,777 --> 00:22:12,155
- Listen, I'd like you to meet Isaac Davis.
- Hi, how do you do? Isaac Davis.

322
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:15,900
- Isaac, hello. Hi.
- Wh-what are you doing here?

323
00:22:16,036 --> 00:22:18,075
Well, of course I'm here.

324
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:23,032
What a funny coincidence.
Excuse me, Isaac Davis. We met before.

325
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:26,038
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's all right.

326
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:28,752
I heard you... quit your job.

327
00:22:28,882 --> 00:22:33,010
Yeah. A real self-destructive impulse.
I wanna write a book, so I...

328
00:22:33,136 --> 00:22:37,181
Has anybody read that Nazis are gonna
march in New Jersey, you know?

329
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:39,762
We should go there,
get some guys together.

330
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:43,096
Get some bricks and baseball bats
and explain things to 'em.

331
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:47,013
<i>There was this devastating
satirical piece on that in the Times. </i>

332
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:52,357
<i>Well, a satirical piece in the Times is
one thing, but bricks get right to the point.</i>

333
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:55,443
But biting satire
is better that physical force.

334
00:22:55,575 --> 00:23:00,818
No, physical force is better with Nazis.
It's hard to satirise a guy with shiny boots.

335
00:23:00,955 --> 00:23:04,704
- Well, you get emotional, but...
- We were talking about orgasms.

336
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:07,705
- Oh, no, please!
- Really? I'm sorry. I didn't...

337
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:11,289
I'm from Philadelphia.
We never talk about such things in public.

338
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:14,591
You said that before.
I don't know what it meant then either.

339
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:18,088
I'm just about to direct a film...
of my own script.

340
00:23:18,223 --> 00:23:21,140
The premise is this guy screws so great...

341
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:23,509
<i>- Screws so great?
- Screws so great</i>

342
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:28,057
<i>that when he brings a woman to orgasm,
she's so fulfilled that she dies.</i>

343
00:23:28,191 --> 00:23:31,275
Now this one, excuse me,
finds this hostile.

344
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:34,895
It's worse than hostile.
It's aggressive-homicidal.

345
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:39,194
You have to forgive Dennis.
He's Harvard direct to Beverly Hills.

346
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:43,027
It's... Theodor Reik
with a touch of Charles Manson.

347
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:48,710
I finally had an orgasm and my doctor
told me it was the wrong kind.

348
00:23:49,837 --> 00:23:53,289
Did you have the wrong kind?
I've never had the wrong kind. Ever.

349
00:23:53,424 --> 00:23:55,796
My worst one was right on the money.

350
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:05,349
- Good night. It was nice to meet you.
- Same here.

351
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:07,305
Bye-bye.

352
00:24:07,438 --> 00:24:09,894
Oh, gee!

353
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:14,315
It's an interesting group of people.
Like the cast of a Fellini movie.

354
00:24:14,445 --> 00:24:18,313
They're such fun, such wonderful people,
and Helen is a good friend.

355
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:21,652
She's a brilliant woman. She's a genius.

356
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:24,277
I met her through
my ex-husband Jeremiah.

357
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:27,284
How come you guys got divorced?
I never...

358
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:29,872
What do you mean
"How come we got divorced?"

359
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,707
What kind of a question is that?
I hardly know you.

360
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:37,797
- You don't have to tell me if you don't...
- Well, we had problems. We fought a lot.

361
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:42,885
I was tired of submerging my identity to
a brilliant, dominating man. He's a genius.

362
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:47,891
He was a genius, Helen's a genius, Dennis
is a genius. You know a lot of geniuses.

363
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,721
You should meet some stupid people.
You could learn something.

364
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,897
Well, why'd you get a divorce?

365
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:58,772
Why? I got a divorce because my ex-wife
left me for another woman.

366
00:24:58,906 --> 00:25:00,531
Really?

367
00:25:00,658 --> 00:25:05,367
- God, that must have been demoralising.
- I took it well under the circumstances.

368
00:25:05,496 --> 00:25:08,414
- Phew-wee.
- I tried to run 'em both over with a car.

369
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,866
That's incredible sexual humiliation.

370
00:25:11,002 --> 00:25:14,702
It's enough to turn you off women
and it accounts for the little girl.

371
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:19,168
Hey, the little girl is fine.
Jesus, she's... What's with the little girl?

372
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:23,513
Oh, sure. I understand, believe me.
176 years old, no possible threat at all.

373
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:28,384
She's 17 7. She's gonna be eight...
Sometimes you have a losing personality.

374
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:32,848
I'm honest. I say what's on my mind
and if you can't take it, then fuck off.

375
00:25:32,982 --> 00:25:36,682
I like the way you express yourself, too.
Pithy, yet degenerate.

376
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:40,188
- You get many dates? I don't think so.
- No, I do. I actually do.

377
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:42,445
I never thought I was very pretty.

378
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:47,569
Oh, what is pretty anyway? I hate being
pretty. It's all so subjective anyway.

379
00:25:47,705 --> 00:25:51,405
The brightest men just drop dead
in front of a beautiful face.

380
00:25:51,542 --> 00:25:55,587
When you climb into the sack,
if you're a bit giving, they're so grateful.

381
00:25:55,713 --> 00:25:57,540
Yeah, I know I am.

382
00:25:57,673 --> 00:25:59,713
- D'you have kids?
- Yeah.

383
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:02,000
He's being raised by two women.

384
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:06,928
I think it works. They made some studies,
I read in a psychoanalytic quarterly.

385
00:26:07,057 --> 00:26:09,513
You don't need a male.
Two mothers are fine.

386
00:26:09,643 --> 00:26:13,344
<i>Really? Because I feel
very few people survive one mother.</i>

387
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,774
Listen, I gotta get my dog. Wanna wait?
I gotta walk it. Are you in rush?

388
00:26:17,902 --> 00:26:22,065
- Oh, no, sure. What kind of dog you got?
- The worst.

389
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:25,566
It's a dachshund.
You know, it's a penis substitute for me.

390
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:29,366
Oh, I would have thought then
in your case a Great Dane.

391
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:51,137
- So, you serious with Yale or what?
- Serious?

392
00:26:52,728 --> 00:26:54,767
Well, he's married.

393
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:59,147
Uh, I don't know. I guess
I should straighten my life out, huh?

394
00:26:59,276 --> 00:27:01,482
Donny my analyst always tells me...

395
00:27:01,612 --> 00:27:05,277
- You call your analyst Donny?
- Yeah. I call him Donny!

396
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:09,950
I call mine Dr Chomsky, you know.
He hits me with a ruler.

397
00:27:10,704 --> 00:27:12,744
Donny...? That's first name.

398
00:27:12,873 --> 00:27:16,740
Donny says I get involved in situations
and that it's deliberate,

399
00:27:16,877 --> 00:27:19,997
especially with my ex-husband Jeremiah.

400
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,957
I was his student and...

401
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,341
- Really? You married your teacher?
- Yeah, of course.

402
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:27,093
That's very...

403
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:30,506
- He failed me and I fell in love with him.
- Oh, that's perfect.

404
00:27:30,641 --> 00:27:33,595
I was sleeping with him
and he had the nerve to give me an F.

405
00:27:33,727 --> 00:27:35,554
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

406
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,807
Not even an Incomplete, right?
Just a straight F?

407
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:40,980
You got a good sense of humour.

408
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:44,810
Hey, thanks! I don't need you
to tell me that, you know.

409
00:27:44,947 --> 00:27:49,276
I've been making good money off it for
years, till I quit my job to write this book.

410
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:52,778
Now I'm very, very nervous about it,
you know, but...

411
00:27:53,413 --> 00:27:55,869
D'you wanna...?
Oh, you don't have to pay.

412
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:59,202
- Oh, that's OK.
- I'm serious! Wanna walk by the river?

413
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:01,578
- You know the time?
- What do you mean?

414
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,750
If I don't get at least 176 hours,
I'm a basket case.

415
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:08,632
I'd like to hear about your book.
I really would. I'm quite a good editor.

416
00:28:08,762 --> 00:28:10,386
Yeah?

417
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:13,799
Well, my book is about
decaying values. It's about...

418
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:18,726
<i>See, years ago I wrote a short story about
my mother called The Castrating Zionist</i>

419
00:28:18,855 --> 00:28:23,316
and I wanna expand it into a novel.
I could talk about my book all night.

420
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:37,990
Isn't it beautiful out?

421
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:41,825
Yeah, it's really so pretty
when the light starts to come up.

422
00:28:41,962 --> 00:28:44,001
I know. I love it.

423
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:49,759
Boy, this is really a great city.
I don't care what anybody says.

424
00:28:49,886 --> 00:28:52,342
It's really a knockout, you know.

425
00:28:56,393 --> 00:29:01,683
I think I better head back. I've got an
appointment with Yale for lunch later on.

426
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:26,578
Mm, hi.

427
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:28,754
No, no. No, I'm awake.

428
00:29:29,592 --> 00:29:33,211
Jesus, what are you...
What are you doing? It's 7.17 5.

429
00:29:34,014 --> 00:29:36,053
Oh, yeah.

430
00:29:37,892 --> 00:29:39,719
Really?

431
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:42,518
You did? At the museum?

432
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:46,265
Yeah, well, she's very active
in the feminist movement.

433
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:50,187
So you're gonna go
apartment hunting with Tracy?

434
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:55,607
Yeah, well, you should be able
to find something. It's Isaac.

435
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:58,697
Yeah, I don't think you'll have any trouble.

436
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:04,204
I knew you'd... see she's a terrific
woman, if you spent some time with her.

437
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:09,211
You still feel the same way about her?
Cos you hadn't mentioned it in a while.

438
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,626
So you... Yeah.

439
00:30:15,763 --> 00:30:18,681
Yeah... right. I know.

440
00:30:18,808 --> 00:30:21,133
She's great, I know. Great.

441
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:25,563
So... No, I gotta go apartment hunting
today. I have to get something cheaper.

442
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,442
I can't keep living where I do.
It's just...

443
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,438
- Isaac's terrific, isn't he?
- Yeah.

444
00:30:36,576 --> 00:30:38,615
Said he had a great time with you.

445
00:30:38,745 --> 00:30:42,577
Really? That's good cos I always think
he's uncomfortable around me.

446
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,746
Oh, come on.

447
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:49,834
- I missed you so much.
- Yale, this is ridiculous. You're married.

448
00:30:49,964 --> 00:30:53,250
Listen to me. I'm beginning
to sound like one of those women.

449
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,424
It sounds terrible. I hate it.

450
00:30:55,553 --> 00:31:01,259
- Why don't I just move out?
- No! I don't wanna break up a marriage.

451
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:05,722
Besides, I'm not looking for any
big involvement here. It's just... I don't...

452
00:31:05,855 --> 00:31:10,019
It's crazy. It's crazy. I think about you
when you're not around.

453
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:14,524
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing. I don't know.

454
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:18,356
I just guess I should be seeing
someone who's not married.

455
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:21,992
- You're so beautiful. You make me crazy.
- Oh, Yale, please stop it.

456
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:25,324
We're in Bloomingdale's
and someone's gonna see us.

457
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:28,375
Did I tell you I may have
an interview with Borges?

458
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:33,580
I told you that we met before. He seems
to feel very comfortable around me.

459
00:31:33,716 --> 00:31:38,378
- Let's go somewhere and make love.
- Not now! Not now, Jesus.

460
00:31:38,513 --> 00:31:42,641
Anyway, you've got a writing class in
an hour. Your students are gonna know.

461
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:46,847
You're gonna have
this big grin on your face.

462
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:51,937
And I don't wanna go to your house cos I
can't stand the dog and the phone ringing.

463
00:31:52,068 --> 00:31:56,315
Can't you hold me? Does your love for me
always have to express itself sexually?

464
00:31:56,447 --> 00:32:01,239
What about other values like warmth
and spiritual contact? Hotel, right?

465
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:03,408
Jesus, I'm a pushover!

466
00:32:05,915 --> 00:32:07,539
Oh, hi, Isaac.

467
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:10,667
- Hi. Is Willie ready?
- Yeah. Come on in.

468
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,834
He'll be right down.

469
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,834
- How you been, lke?
- Good. How you been?

470
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,006
- I've been terrific.
- Yeah?

471
00:32:18,135 --> 00:32:21,967
Yeah. Been getting a lot of work done.
Things are going really well.

472
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:26,047
- Want some coffee or something?
- Uh, no. How's Willie doing?

473
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:29,886
Willie's fine. He's beginning
to show some real talent in drawing.

474
00:32:30,022 --> 00:32:33,225
Where does he get that?
Cos you don't draw and I don't draw.

475
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,770
I draw.

476
00:32:34,902 --> 00:32:38,271
Yeah, but there's no way that
you could be the actual father.

477
00:32:39,865 --> 00:32:44,361
I'm hoping you'll take Willie on the 176th
cos Connie and I want to go to Barbados.

478
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:49,204
Are you still gonna write that stupid book?
I mean, are you serious about that?

479
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:53,876
I'm very serious about it. It's an honest
book. You have nothing to be ashamed of.

480
00:32:54,004 --> 00:32:56,875
- Excuse me.
- Can I talk to you a minute? Excuse me.

481
00:32:57,007 --> 00:33:00,341
Here's what I still don't understand.
Where are you running?

482
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:03,470
I can't understand
how you can prefer her to me.

483
00:33:03,597 --> 00:33:05,424
- You can't understand?
- No.

484
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:07,384
You knew my history!

485
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:12,014
I know. My analyst warned me, but you
were so beautiful I got another analyst.

486
00:33:12,147 --> 00:33:16,145
- D'you think we can be ever just friends?
- You're putting in all the details?

487
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:19,396
No, not the part where
you tried to run her over with the car.

488
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,985
Wha... I tried to run her over with a car?

489
00:33:22,116 --> 00:33:25,651
What are you talking about?
It was late. You know I don't drive well.

490
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:27,826
It was raining. It was dark.

491
00:33:27,955 --> 00:33:30,244
Why were you lurking outside the cabin?

492
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:34,835
I was spying on you guys cos I knew what
was happening. You were falling in love.

493
00:33:34,962 --> 00:33:37,583
So you felt you had to
run her over with the car?

494
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:41,380
Do I look like that type of person?
You know how slowly I was going?

495
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,546
Not slowly enough
that you didn't rip the front porch off.

496
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:49,306
Get the kid. I can't... I can't have
this argument every time I come over.

497
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,635
- You look funny in that jacket.
- I know.

498
00:34:28,765 --> 00:34:32,051
I had hoped for something
in the gabardine.

499
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:34,427
- So, do you miss me?
- Yeah. Do you miss me?

500
00:34:34,563 --> 00:34:38,430
Of course I miss you. I love you. That's
why I come and get you all the time.

501
00:34:38,567 --> 00:34:42,861
- Why can't we have frankfurters?
- Because this is a Russian tearoom.

502
00:34:42,988 --> 00:34:47,033
I mean, you wanna have a blintz or
something. Frankfurter gives you cancer.

503
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,702
Besides, you see those two women here?
They have very beautiful women here.

504
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:56,706
We could do well. I think we could have
picked up these two, if you were quicker.

505
00:34:56,835 --> 00:34:58,875
I'm serious.

506
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,871
I think the brunette liked you.

507
00:35:04,926 --> 00:35:08,130
I think I should, uh...
No, I'll call him.

508
00:35:18,523 --> 00:35:21,524
Hello, Yale? I'm sorry for calling.

509
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:25,150
Well, no, no, nothing's wrong. I...

510
00:35:26,281 --> 00:35:29,567
Well, I just thought that it's Sunday out

511
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:34,992
and maybe if you could get away,
we could go for a walk or...

512
00:35:37,584 --> 00:35:42,744
Oh, that's right. You mentioned that.
Well, OK, it was just a shot. Yeah. Yeah.

513
00:35:42,881 --> 00:35:46,167
Well, I won't keep you. OK. Bye-bye.

514
00:35:52,098 --> 00:35:53,925
Hello?

515
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:57,270
Oh, hi! Hi, how you doin'?

516
00:35:58,814 --> 00:36:03,890
No, not at all. I was just sitting around
looking through the magazine section.

517
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:09,772
Uh, no, no, I didn't read the piece
on China's faceless masses.

518
00:36:09,908 --> 00:36:12,399
I was checking out the lingerie ads.

519
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:15,572
Yeah, I can never get past them.
They're really erotic.

520
00:36:15,705 --> 00:36:17,745
You wanna go for a walk?

521
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:24,000
I don't know, I've gotta get out. I'm going
stir-crazy and Yale's with Emily's parents.

522
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,503
It's such a beautiful Sunday.

523
00:36:28,635 --> 00:36:31,920
It's an electrical storm.
You wanna wind up in an ashtray?

524
00:36:32,055 --> 00:36:34,724
- It was such a beautiful day out.
- Yeah, wonderful.

525
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:37,091
I think the Chrysler Building blew up.

526
00:36:37,227 --> 00:36:41,271
- Oh, no! Thunder scares me.
- It's not my favourite sound either.

527
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:45,976
D'you know every year one or two people
get killed during a storm in Central Park?

528
00:36:46,111 --> 00:36:48,684
Why don't I run up ahead
and we'll talk later?

529
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:07,086
Jesus Christ, I'm soaking wet.
This is awful!

530
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:09,338
You look ridiculous! You know that?

531
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:13,085
Next time you want someone
to walk with you, get somebody else.

532
00:37:13,221 --> 00:37:16,886
I've never seen anybody
react so strongly to a little bit of water.

533
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:19,686
It wasn't the water. It was the electricity.

534
00:37:19,811 --> 00:37:23,262
I'll turn into a guy that sells
comics outside Bloomingdale's.

535
00:37:23,398 --> 00:37:26,564
What do you think?
You think I look terrible? How do I look?

536
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:30,358
- I can't see.
- You should see your face!

537
00:37:30,488 --> 00:37:33,987
You look kinda nice, actually.
You're sort of pretty.

538
00:37:34,742 --> 00:37:37,779
- I'm really annoyed with Yale.
- Why?

539
00:37:37,912 --> 00:37:40,830
He was supposed to see me today
and then he couldn't.

540
00:37:40,957 --> 00:37:45,002
And I had tickets to this Vivaldi concert.
He had to cancel on me, of course.

541
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:49,256
- That's what happens when...
- I know. You're having an affair.

542
00:37:49,382 --> 00:37:52,716
- What a terrible way to put it.
- Hey, I didn't put it that way.

543
00:37:52,844 --> 00:37:56,676
My husband, well, my ex-husband,
had an affair when we were married.

544
00:37:56,806 --> 00:37:59,558
- Really?
- Yeah. At least one that I know of.

545
00:37:59,684 --> 00:38:03,931
And I never mentioned anything because
I felt that I was deficient in some way.

546
00:38:04,063 --> 00:38:08,275
That I was bad in bed, not bright enough,
or physically unattractive.

547
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:12,315
- But in the end he was just a louse.
- Yeah, I know. An intellectual louse.

548
00:38:12,447 --> 00:38:15,613
Oh, God, was he brilliant.
I was so crazy about him.

549
00:38:15,742 --> 00:38:18,696
Really opened me up sexually.
Taught me everything.

550
00:38:18,828 --> 00:38:20,868
Women found him devastating.

551
00:38:21,914 --> 00:38:24,156
Oh, look. There's Saturn.

552
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:26,783
Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun.

553
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:30,004
How many of the satellites of Saturn
can you name?

554
00:38:30,131 --> 00:38:35,125
There's Mimas, Titan, Dione.
Hyperion, of course.

555
00:38:35,261 --> 00:38:39,425
I can't name any of 'em and fortunately
they never come up in conversation.

556
00:38:39,557 --> 00:38:42,226
Facts.
I got a million facts at my fingertips.

557
00:38:42,351 --> 00:38:47,097
They mean nothing cos nothing worth
knowing is understood with the mind.

558
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:50,481
Everything valuable enters
through a different opening,

559
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:53,183
if you'll forgive the disgusting imagery.

560
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:56,855
I don't agree at all. Where would we be
without rational thought?

561
00:38:56,991 --> 00:39:00,277
You... you... you rely too much
on your brain.

562
00:39:00,411 --> 00:39:03,246
The brain is the most overrated organ.

563
00:39:03,372 --> 00:39:06,991
I know. You probably think
I'm too cerebral.

564
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:10,412
Well, you are, you know,
kind of on the brainy side.

565
00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:14,591
What's the difference what I think about
you? God knows what you think of me.

566
00:39:14,717 --> 00:39:16,757
You're fine. Are you kidding?

567
00:39:16,886 --> 00:39:20,836
You do have a tendency to get
a little hostile, but I find that attractive.

568
00:39:20,973 --> 00:39:24,508
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm glad you do.

569
00:39:24,644 --> 00:39:28,178
So, you think I have no feelings?
Is that it?

570
00:39:28,314 --> 00:39:33,023
Hey, wha... You're so sensitive, Jesus!
I never said that.

571
00:39:33,944 --> 00:39:37,479
I think you're... I think you're terrific.

572
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:42,695
Really, you know. I... I...
You're very insecure.

573
00:39:42,828 --> 00:39:45,498
I think you're wonderful, really.

574
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:50,039
What do you think?
It's probably stopped raining out.

575
00:39:50,169 --> 00:39:53,004
You wanna grab a bite
or something like that?

576
00:39:54,048 --> 00:39:58,924
I gotta see somebody this evening.
I don't know if it's a great idea.

577
00:39:59,053 --> 00:40:02,054
Right. Well...
So what about sometime next week?

578
00:40:02,181 --> 00:40:05,550
I might give you a call,
if you have any free time?

579
00:40:09,271 --> 00:40:14,942
I'm... I'm not gonna have any free time
cos... I don't think it's such a great idea.

580
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:20,739
I'm working on this book and it,
you know, takes a lot of my energy up.

581
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:22,775
OK. OK.

582
00:40:24,578 --> 00:40:29,287
Your parents were in a good mood.
I almost had a good time.

583
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:32,868
- Who did you call after dinner?
- Oh, uh, David Cohen.

584
00:40:33,003 --> 00:40:35,921
He wants me to review the new book
on Virginia Woolf.

585
00:40:36,048 --> 00:40:38,919
Written another one, if you can believe it.

586
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,844
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine. What do you mean?

587
00:40:42,972 --> 00:40:46,720
- You seem sort of nervous.
- No, I'm not. I feel good.

588
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:50,516
<i>- I was gonna ask you how you felt.
- No. I'm OK.</i>

589
00:40:50,646 --> 00:40:55,107
- You seemed strange at dinner.
- Ah, just more thoughts about kids.

590
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:57,273
Oh, come on.

591
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:04,069
Listen, I told Cohen I'd stop by and
pick up the book. Is that OK with you?

592
00:41:04,201 --> 00:41:05,992
Yeah.

593
00:41:06,203 --> 00:41:07,781
It's not too crowded.

594
00:41:07,913 --> 00:41:11,496
No, not bad for Sunday.
I thought it'd be jammed.

595
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:17,082
Gee, I'm glad you could get out tonight
cos... I really did wanna see you a lot.

596
00:41:17,214 --> 00:41:20,832
I like it when you get
an uncontrollable urge.

597
00:41:20,968 --> 00:41:23,091
Yeah, I know, it's my best feature.

598
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:27,348
My boyish impetuosity.
It's my... You look adorable.

599
00:41:27,474 --> 00:41:29,514
So I have a chance to go to London,

600
00:41:29,643 --> 00:41:32,395
study with the Academy
of Music and Dramatic Arts.

601
00:41:32,521 --> 00:41:36,982
- Really? When did this happen?
- The other day. Got a letter in the mail.

602
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:40,359
Well, that's great. That's terrific.

603
00:41:40,487 --> 00:41:43,358
But I don't wanna go without you.

604
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,779
Hey, I can't go to London and study.

605
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:49,610
Especially Shakespeare.
You know, I don't look good in leotards.

606
00:41:49,746 --> 00:41:53,744
- I'm serious.
- Of course you should go. It's great.

607
00:41:53,876 --> 00:41:55,500
You'll have a great time.

608
00:41:55,627 --> 00:42:01,001
It's a great town and you're a wonderful
actress and it's a terrific place to study.

609
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:04,751
You'll be the toast of the town.
You'll have a good time, really.

610
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:08,635
- You shouldn't pass that...
- So what happens to us?

611
00:42:08,765 --> 00:42:11,766
Well, you know, we'll always have Paris.

612
00:42:11,893 --> 00:42:13,720
I'm kidding.

613
00:42:13,854 --> 00:42:17,057
What kind of question is that?
You can't think of that now.

614
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:20,108
You won't take me seriously
just because I'm 17 7.

615
00:42:20,235 --> 00:42:24,447
Yeah, exactly, because you're 17 7.
I mean, it's ridiculous.

616
00:42:24,573 --> 00:42:27,146
You're 17 7 now. When you're 36, I'll be...

617
00:42:29,286 --> 00:42:30,994
63.

618
00:42:31,121 --> 00:42:33,363
63, right. Thank you.

619
00:42:33,498 --> 00:42:37,448
You know, it's absurd. You'll be
at the height of your sexual powers.

620
00:42:37,586 --> 00:42:39,874
Of course, I will too probably, but,

621
00:42:40,005 --> 00:42:42,128
you know, I'm a late starter.

622
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:44,297
<i>- Who ordered the plain pie?
- Me.</i>

623
00:42:44,426 --> 00:42:47,427
So you must be anchovies,
sausage, mushrooms, peppers.

624
00:42:48,513 --> 00:42:50,553
Forgot the coconut.

625
00:42:51,558 --> 00:42:56,765
So what do you wanna do tonight? We'll
go to the movies, I'll take you dancing...

626
00:42:56,897 --> 00:42:59,222
- Anything?
- Absolutely anything.

627
00:42:59,357 --> 00:43:01,397
OK, I know what we can do.

628
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:05,820
- Well, get the filthy look off your face.
- Shut up. It's not filthy.

629
00:43:21,338 --> 00:43:26,047
This is so corny. I can't believe this.
Is this what you wanted to do?

630
00:43:26,176 --> 00:43:28,797
I don't think it's corny.
I think it's fun!

631
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:31,633
It is fun, but I did this
when I was a kid, you know.

632
00:43:31,765 --> 00:43:34,600
Well, I've never done it. I think it's great.

633
00:43:34,726 --> 00:43:39,055
On my prom night I went
around this park five times, six times.

634
00:43:39,189 --> 00:43:43,233
If I had been with a girl, this would
have been an incredible experience.

635
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:00,834
Quit fighting it.
You know you're crazy about me.

636
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,495
I am. You're... You're God's answer to Job.

637
00:44:04,631 --> 00:44:07,548
You would have ended
all argument between them.

638
00:44:07,675 --> 00:44:12,752
He'd have said "I do a lot of terrible things
but I can also make one of these."

639
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:15,558
And Job would've said "OK, you win."

640
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:30,357
Look, this is crazy. I just can't do this
any more. It's really bullshit!

641
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:33,859
You're married and
I expected to see you this weekend

642
00:44:33,993 --> 00:44:38,323
and I sit around like I've nothing to do,
so I called Isaac. We went for a walk.

643
00:44:38,456 --> 00:44:42,039
- It was just lucky he was free.
- I know. I'm sorry.

644
00:44:42,168 --> 00:44:46,213
Oh, it's not your fault.
What the hell. It's a no-win situation.

645
00:44:46,339 --> 00:44:49,506
It's just I'm beautiful and I'm bright
and I deserve better!

646
00:44:49,634 --> 00:44:50,962
I know.

647
00:44:51,094 --> 00:44:54,048
- What if I took some action?
- No!

648
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,220
I'm not a home wrecker.

649
00:44:56,349 --> 00:44:59,800
I don't know how I got into this.
I guess we met at the wrong time.

650
00:44:59,936 --> 00:45:01,975
It happens. Hello?

651
00:45:02,105 --> 00:45:04,975
Oh, hi. Oh, hi, Harvey. How are you?

652
00:45:05,817 --> 00:45:07,145
What?

653
00:45:07,277 --> 00:45:12,519
Well... why don't you bring it by
on Thursday and I'll read it then, OK?

654
00:45:12,657 --> 00:45:17,996
Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK.
Right, I'll talk to you later. OK, bye-bye.

655
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:21,406
- What d'you want me to do?
- Waffles. Nothing. It's just...

656
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:26,084
Waffles! Will you stop that now?
We're just going noplace. Excuse me.

657
00:45:26,212 --> 00:45:31,123
Look, I know it's terrible. I'm at Sneedon's
Landing with Emily and her parents

658
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:34,841
and I love her!
And I'm thinking about you all the time.

659
00:45:34,971 --> 00:45:38,636
I don't wa... Christ. I don't wanna hear it.

660
00:45:38,808 --> 00:45:42,011
I'm from Philadelphia.
My family's never had affairs.

661
00:45:42,145 --> 00:45:46,474
My parents have been married 43 years.
Nobody cheats at all. Hello?

662
00:45:46,607 --> 00:45:49,145
Oh, Donny. Hi! It's my analyst.

663
00:45:49,277 --> 00:45:51,316
Hello.

664
00:45:52,238 --> 00:45:56,449
No...
Well, I think that'd be impossible.

665
00:45:56,576 --> 00:46:01,284
OK, well, probably later in the week.
OK, all right.

666
00:46:01,414 --> 00:46:04,083
I'll get back to you. OK, bye.

667
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:06,746
Oh, man. Waffles!

668
00:46:06,878 --> 00:46:11,670
Please, just don't. This is really
a bad time... Waffles! ...a bad time for me.

669
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:15,048
I gotta think things through here.

670
00:46:16,888 --> 00:46:20,588
- Obviously I shouldn't have come here.
- Well, no, probably not.

671
00:46:49,587 --> 00:46:51,793
Listen to that! How am I gonna...?

672
00:46:51,922 --> 00:46:55,706
What is that sound? Can you hear that?
Listen. Where's it coming from?

673
00:46:55,843 --> 00:46:59,177
It's like somebody's playing the trumpet.

674
00:46:59,305 --> 00:47:04,216
Or somebody sawing... Like a man
sawing a trumpet in half. Right? Right?

675
00:47:04,351 --> 00:47:06,474
- Let's fool around.
- You hear it?

676
00:47:06,687 --> 00:47:08,596
It'll take your mind off it.

677
00:47:08,731 --> 00:47:12,396
How many times a night...? How often
can you make love in an evening?

678
00:47:12,526 --> 00:47:15,444
- Well, a lot.
- Yeah, I can tell. A lot. That's...

679
00:47:15,571 --> 00:47:18,691
Well, a lot is my favourite number.
Gee, really? Can you?

680
00:47:18,824 --> 00:47:22,027
Let's do it some strange way
you've always wanted to do,

681
00:47:22,161 --> 00:47:24,200
but nobody would do with you.

682
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:27,864
I'm shocked. What kind of talk is that
from a kid your age?

683
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,084
I'll get my scuba-diving equipment
and really show you...

684
00:47:31,212 --> 00:47:34,212
- Take me seriously!
- I do take you seriously, but...

685
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,839
Listen to this. Am I crazy? Wha...? Ah!

686
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:42,215
It's a rumbling. Listen to that goddamn...
Where the hell is that coming from?

687
00:47:42,348 --> 00:47:47,769
- It's probably just the elevator shaft.
- It's not. It's coming from the walls.

688
00:47:47,895 --> 00:47:50,564
Let's... Let's... Can we check into a hotel?

689
00:47:50,689 --> 00:47:53,476
- Oh, you're crazy!
- I can't sleep here. I can't.

690
00:47:53,609 --> 00:47:55,934
Where's the aspirin? What d'you do...

691
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:59,024
I can help you fix this place up,
if you give me a chance.

692
00:47:59,156 --> 00:48:01,564
No, and I don't want you living here.

693
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,828
Tonight is a special occasion.
It's my first night in the apartment,

694
00:48:05,955 --> 00:48:09,703
so I wanted to break in the place
and I was afraid to sleep alone.

695
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:12,872
Hey, what is this?
There's brown water!

696
00:48:13,003 --> 00:48:16,253
- The pipes are rusty.
- What is this, Tracy?

697
00:48:16,382 --> 00:48:19,881
- The pipes are rusty.
- Look at this. It's brown water.

698
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,759
I'm paying $700 a month.
I got rats with bongos and a frog.

699
00:48:23,889 --> 00:48:25,929
And I got brown water here.

700
00:48:26,058 --> 00:48:29,094
- Look. It's disgusting.
- What's gonna happen to us?

701
00:48:29,228 --> 00:48:32,762
Listen. You keep ignoring me.
What's gonna happen with us?

702
00:48:32,898 --> 00:48:36,599
What do you mean?
D'you have a good time with me?

703
00:48:36,735 --> 00:48:40,649
- Aren't I a load of laughs and fun?
- Yes.

704
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:43,153
So, and that's it, and we have fun.

705
00:48:43,283 --> 00:48:46,569
Then you're gonna go to London
exactly as we discussed it.

706
00:48:46,703 --> 00:48:51,247
You're gonna take advantage of that
opportunity and study acting over there.

707
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:55,455
And you'll think of me always
as a fond memory. It'll be nice.

708
00:48:55,587 --> 00:48:58,292
You know we have to
stop seeing each other?

709
00:48:58,423 --> 00:49:00,879
Oh, yeah. Right, right.

710
00:49:01,009 --> 00:49:04,758
I understand. I could tell by
the sound of your voice over the phone.

711
00:49:04,888 --> 00:49:09,431
<i>Very authoritative, you know.
Like the Pope or the computer in 2001.</i>

712
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,430
It's not fair to you
and I don't know what I'm doing.

713
00:49:12,563 --> 00:49:15,100
- Right.
- I mean... Come on, don't be angry.

714
00:49:15,232 --> 00:49:18,815
You brought this up. You're not happy
the way things are going.

715
00:49:18,944 --> 00:49:24,698
I'm not angry. It's just I knew it was gonna
end, but now it's happened I'm upset, OK?

716
00:49:24,825 --> 00:49:27,363
Look, you don't wanna
make a commitment.

717
00:49:27,494 --> 00:49:31,955
And I don't wanna break up my marriage
and then find out we're no good together.

718
00:49:32,082 --> 00:49:34,407
I've gotta start thinking about Emily.

719
00:49:34,543 --> 00:49:39,620
OK, you made your point very clear. I'm
just glad one of us had the nerve to end it.

720
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:43,218
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah...

721
00:49:43,343 --> 00:49:46,759
Of course I will. What d'you think
I'm gonna do? Hang myself?

722
00:49:46,888 --> 00:49:50,340
I'm a beautiful woman.
I'm young, highly intelligent.

723
00:49:50,475 --> 00:49:53,145
I got everything going for me. The point...

724
00:49:53,854 --> 00:49:58,432
The point is that... I don't know,
I'm all fucked up. I'm just... Shit!

725
00:49:58,567 --> 00:50:03,229
What am I doing in this relationship
anyway? My phone never stops ringing.

726
00:50:03,363 --> 00:50:08,239
I could go to bed with the entire faculty
of MIT, if I wanted to. It's just...

727
00:50:08,368 --> 00:50:12,033
I don't know. I'm wasting myself
on a married man, so I don't know.

728
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:17,705
Listen, I think I'd better go now.
I just want you to have this.

729
00:50:17,836 --> 00:50:22,545
- I got these tickets to see Rampal tonight.
- Oh, Mary. This is very hard on me, too.

730
00:50:22,674 --> 00:50:25,295
Please! Just take them
and go with your wife.

731
00:50:25,427 --> 00:50:29,471
Mary, you love Rampal.
Call somebody up. Take Isaac.

732
00:50:29,598 --> 00:50:31,637
Fuck off, Yale!

733
00:50:32,851 --> 00:50:38,011
I know you're gonna think the water's
a little brown, but you can drink it.

734
00:50:38,148 --> 00:50:40,187
Don't get thrown by this.

735
00:50:40,317 --> 00:50:43,401
- I'm really sorry for bothering you.
- No problem.

736
00:50:43,528 --> 00:50:48,688
- It's just... God, this is brown, isn't it?
- It is, but you get used to it after a while.

737
00:50:48,825 --> 00:50:50,652
I didn't know who to call.

738
00:50:50,785 --> 00:50:53,703
I don't think you should take Valium.
It causes cancer.

739
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:57,413
- No. Half a Valium?
- Yeah, abdominal cancer, I think.

740
00:50:57,542 --> 00:50:59,582
When did they find that out?

741
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:03,756
That's just my theory, but I think
it's correct. I got tissues someplace.

742
00:51:03,882 --> 00:51:07,132
- Well, I guess I deserve everything I get.
- Come on.

743
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:11,340
It's true. It's really true. I mean,
I knew it couldn't possibly work out.

744
00:51:11,473 --> 00:51:13,512
Yeah, you pick a married guy

745
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:17,307
and when it doesn't work out,
it confirms your worst feelings.

746
00:51:17,437 --> 00:51:19,476
What worst feelings?

747
00:51:19,606 --> 00:51:24,647
You know. Your feelings about men
and marriage and that nothing works.

748
00:51:24,778 --> 00:51:28,360
Oh, please, don't psychoanalyse me.
I pay a doctor for that.

749
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:32,783
Hey. You call that guy
that you talk to a doctor?

750
00:51:32,911 --> 00:51:38,581
You don't get suspicious when he calls
you at 3am and weeps into the telephone?

751
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:41,579
So he's unorthodox.
He's a highly qualified doctor.

752
00:51:41,711 --> 00:51:46,040
He's done a great job on you. Your
self-esteem is like a notch below Kafka's.

753
00:51:46,174 --> 00:51:48,250
What is that noise?

754
00:51:48,384 --> 00:51:52,881
Yeah. Incredible, isn't it? There's a guy
upstairs. I don't know what the hell it is.

755
00:51:53,014 --> 00:51:57,059
It's like he's up there strangling a parrot
or something. I can't stand it.

756
00:51:57,185 --> 00:52:01,396
- How can you stand it? It's terrible.
- I know. I used to have a great apartment.

757
00:52:01,523 --> 00:52:05,935
- Wanna go for a walk? It's quieter out.
- No, I think I'll just go home.

758
00:52:06,069 --> 00:52:08,108
No, come on.

759
00:52:09,489 --> 00:52:13,617
He led me on! That's the point of it.
Why am I reluctant to criticise him?

760
00:52:13,743 --> 00:52:16,697
Relax. Yale would not do that.
He's not that kind of a guy.

761
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:20,080
Don't defend him.
You guys all stick up for each other.

762
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:25,913
Yale has his problems as we all do.
I'm starting to sound like Rabbi Blitzstein.

763
00:52:26,047 --> 00:52:30,175
Well, thanks for letting me come over.
I appreciate it. It's very nice of you.

764
00:52:30,301 --> 00:52:33,635
Tracy and I are going out tonight,
if you wanna come along.

765
00:52:33,763 --> 00:52:36,219
Oh, no, I'll be fine. I'll be OK.

766
00:52:36,349 --> 00:52:37,973
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

767
00:52:38,101 --> 00:52:42,561
- That's a healthy piece of towel paper.
- Oh, gee. God!

768
00:52:42,689 --> 00:52:44,728
Well, goodbye. Thanks a lot.

769
00:52:46,484 --> 00:52:50,232
<i>But my point is a cab driver
doesn't make enough money... </i>

770
00:52:50,363 --> 00:52:55,191
Oh, look at that... that guy's toupee.
That's unbelievable.

771
00:52:55,326 --> 00:53:00,321
That is hilarious. There's a... a...
an inch of cheesecloth. You can see it.

772
00:53:00,456 --> 00:53:03,991
I don't know why, you know,
his loved ones don't tell him.

773
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:08,539
It's like the toupee dropped on his head
from a window ledge as he was walking.

774
00:53:08,673 --> 00:53:13,299
But look at his wife. Looks like her face
has been lifted about 8,000 times.

775
00:53:13,427 --> 00:53:16,547
I know. It's so plastic. It's so tight.

776
00:53:16,681 --> 00:53:19,136
I hate that. I just hate that. I wish...

777
00:53:19,267 --> 00:53:23,134
Why can't they just age naturally
instead of putting all that junk on?

778
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:25,940
I know. Old faces are... are nice.

779
00:53:26,065 --> 00:53:28,307
Yeah. They're great.

780
00:53:30,528 --> 00:53:35,902
Hey, be careful. I think
I got black bean sauce in the bed.

781
00:53:36,033 --> 00:53:39,449
Oh, look. It's great.
The late show's a WC Fields film.

782
00:53:41,914 --> 00:53:43,954
Oh, great. We gotta watch that.

783
00:53:46,711 --> 00:53:48,537
Oh, God.

784
00:53:49,338 --> 00:53:52,838
Boy, I really feel good, you know.
I got my life together finally.

785
00:53:52,967 --> 00:53:54,378
Yeah?

786
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:59,635
You know, I just had to cut this thing off
finally. I'm not the type for affairs.

787
00:53:59,765 --> 00:54:04,558
- D'you ever hear from Mary, or see her?
- No. We just cut it off. It's easier that way.

788
00:54:04,687 --> 00:54:08,387
She's terrific. She deserves more
than a fling with a married guy.

789
00:54:08,524 --> 00:54:13,400
- Yeah, she's screwed up, but great.
- Right up your alley. You oughta call her.

790
00:54:13,529 --> 00:54:15,937
- I... I should call her?
- Yeah.

791
00:54:16,073 --> 00:54:18,611
- Why should I call her?
- Because she likes you.

792
00:54:18,743 --> 00:54:20,782
She told me she did.

793
00:54:20,911 --> 00:54:24,411
- You're crazy.
- No. She said she finds you attractive.

794
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,457
- She said she found me attractive?
- Yeah.

795
00:54:27,585 --> 00:54:31,001
- When was this?
- She said it when she first met you.

796
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:33,799
- I didn't know. I can't.
- Sorry about that.

797
00:54:33,924 --> 00:54:36,878
I always think of you guys together.
I couldn't...

798
00:54:37,011 --> 00:54:40,427
It's over. Unless you're serious
about Tracy. Are you?

799
00:54:40,556 --> 00:54:43,723
- No. Tracy's too young.
- Then call her up.

800
00:54:43,851 --> 00:54:48,845
Listen, she's an unhappy person.
I mean, she needs something in her life.

801
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:53,394
- I think you guys would be good together.
- I could be a good influence on her.

802
00:54:53,527 --> 00:54:58,604
I think that under my personal vibrations,
I could put her life in a kind of good order.

803
00:54:58,741 --> 00:55:04,031
That's what you said about Jill, and she
went from bisexuality to homosexuality.

804
00:55:04,163 --> 00:55:07,366
Yeah, but I gave it
the old college try there for a while.

805
00:55:07,499 --> 00:55:11,248
- Listen, you should call her up.
- No kidding. What did she say about me?

806
00:55:11,378 --> 00:55:15,079
She said that she likes you very much.
She thinks you're smart.

807
00:55:15,215 --> 00:55:17,789
- She thinks you're...
- Keep going. Don't stop.

808
00:55:17,926 --> 00:55:20,382
- Attractive.
- Really? No kidding.

809
00:55:41,617 --> 00:55:44,986
You see, to me a great movie
is with WC Fields. That's what I like.

810
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,747
<i>Or Grand Illusion.  That's... I see that every
time it's on television, if I'm aware of it.</i>

811
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:52,117
So what you got to eat here? Nothing.

812
00:55:52,252 --> 00:55:57,329
<i>Oh, Jesus, what is this? You got a corned
beef sandwich here from 17 9517, I think.</i>

813
00:55:57,466 --> 00:56:00,336
- Look at this. I mean...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

814
00:56:00,469 --> 00:56:03,968
- I don't have time to cook.
- Corned beef should not be blue.

815
00:56:04,097 --> 00:56:06,220
It's really terrible.

816
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:07,760
- Hey.
- What?

817
00:56:07,893 --> 00:56:09,517
Come here.

818
00:56:15,692 --> 00:56:17,519
What're you doing?

819
00:56:17,653 --> 00:56:21,650
What am I doing? You have to ask?
I was kissing you flush on the mouth.

820
00:56:21,782 --> 00:56:25,032
I... I cannot get my life
in any kind of order. It's just...

821
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,196
- It's something I wanted to do for ages.
- Yeah, I know.

822
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:32,826
Do you? Cos I... I thought I was hiding it.
I was trying to be real cool and casual.

823
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,581
I thought you wanted to kiss me
at the planetarium.

824
00:56:35,712 --> 00:56:37,752
- I did.
- I thought so.

825
00:56:37,881 --> 00:56:43,386
But you were going out with Yale then and
I would never in a million years interfere...

826
00:56:43,512 --> 00:56:45,551
Did you want me to kiss you?

827
00:56:45,681 --> 00:56:49,761
I don't know what I wanted.
I was so angry at Yale that day.

828
00:56:49,893 --> 00:56:53,179
But you were so sexy.
You were soaking wet from the rain

829
00:56:53,313 --> 00:56:57,145
and I had a mad impulse
to throw you down on the lunar surface

830
00:56:57,275 --> 00:57:00,360
and commit
interstellar perversion with you.

831
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:05,149
I can't go from relationship to
relationship. It's senseless. I can't do it.

832
00:57:05,283 --> 00:57:08,735
Well, what... Are you still
hung up on Yale? Is that the problem?

833
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:10,910
I've got too many problems.

834
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:14,704
I'm really not the person
to get involved with. I'm trouble.

835
00:57:14,835 --> 00:57:19,331
- Hey, honey, Trouble is my middle name.
- What are you saying?

836
00:57:19,464 --> 00:57:22,002
Actually, my middle name is Mortimer.

837
00:57:22,134 --> 00:57:24,173
I'm... I'm kidding.

838
00:57:26,805 --> 00:57:30,221
My problem is I'm both attracted
and repelled by the male organ.

839
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:35,013
So it doesn't make for
good relationships with men.

840
00:57:35,147 --> 00:57:37,602
What about your relationships
with women?

841
00:57:37,732 --> 00:57:40,817
You never really told me much
about your first wife.

842
00:57:40,944 --> 00:57:44,230
My first wife was
a kindergarten teacher, you know.

843
00:57:44,364 --> 00:57:47,899
She got into drugs
and she... moved to San Francisco.

844
00:57:48,034 --> 00:57:50,074
Went into est, became a Moonie.

845
00:57:50,203 --> 00:57:52,575
She's with
the William Morris Agency now.

846
00:57:52,706 --> 00:57:54,330
D'you like that?

847
00:57:54,457 --> 00:57:58,325
This... this, I think, has a kind of
wonderful otherness to it, you know.

848
00:57:58,461 --> 00:58:01,297
- A marvellous negative capability.
- OK.

849
00:58:01,423 --> 00:58:04,293
Kind of wonderful energy to it,
don't you think?

850
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:15,099
I thought that wine
was wonderful, didn't you think?

851
00:58:15,228 --> 00:58:18,264
And it just made my face
all flushed and hot.

852
00:58:18,398 --> 00:58:22,775
Yeah. You look so beautiful
I can hardly keep my eyes on the meter.

853
00:58:23,945 --> 00:58:25,570
It's 17 4 bucks!

854
00:58:25,697 --> 00:58:28,781
I know, but it was a great restaurant.
Didn't you love it?

855
00:58:28,908 --> 00:58:33,369
Yeah, I love seafood. Course I'm drunk.
I don't know if you can tell or not.

856
00:58:33,496 --> 00:58:37,624
Hey, you know, it was the only time
in my life I ever had Chianti from Warsaw.

857
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:39,577
- Give me a kiss.
- OK.

858
00:58:49,095 --> 00:58:50,720
What are you thinking?

859
00:58:50,847 --> 00:58:54,132
I was thinking there must be
something wrong with me

860
00:58:54,267 --> 00:58:56,840
because I've never had a relationship

861
00:58:56,978 --> 00:59:00,679
that's lasted longer than
the one between Hitler and Eva Braun.

862
00:59:00,815 --> 00:59:02,974
I think you're still drunk!

863
00:59:42,732 --> 00:59:44,938
It's great. It's... it's...

864
00:59:45,068 --> 00:59:50,026
I don't play the harmonica, but it's
an incredible... harmonica is what it is.

865
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:55,532
<i>Well, you said you wanted to learn.
I'm trying to open up that side of you.</i>

866
00:59:55,661 --> 00:59:59,659
Tracy, you're throwing away
an enormous amount of real affection

867
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:01,830
on the wrong person.

868
01:00:01,959 --> 01:00:03,999
It's not wrong for me.

869
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:12,419
Listen, I don't... I don't think
we should keep seeing each other.

870
01:00:12,553 --> 01:00:14,593
Why not?

871
01:00:14,722 --> 01:00:18,387
Because I think you're getting
too hung up on me, you know?

872
01:00:18,518 --> 01:00:21,139
"Hung up on me."
I'm starting to sound like you.

873
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:23,642
I'm not hung up on you.
I'm in love with you.

874
01:00:23,773 --> 01:00:26,311
You can't be in love with me.
We've been over this.

875
01:00:26,442 --> 01:00:30,191
You're a kid. You don't know what
love means. I don't know what it means.

876
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:32,563
Nobody knows what the hell's going on.

877
01:00:32,698 --> 01:00:35,368
We have laughs together.
I care about you.

878
01:00:35,493 --> 01:00:38,363
Your concerns are my concerns.
We have great sex.

879
01:00:38,496 --> 01:00:40,535
You... But you're 17 7 years old.

880
01:00:40,706 --> 01:00:44,407
By the time you're 217,
you'll have a dozen relationships,

881
01:00:44,544 --> 01:00:47,295
believe me,
far more passionate than this one.

882
01:00:47,421 --> 01:00:49,747
Well, don't you love me?

883
01:00:52,718 --> 01:00:55,423
The truth is that I love somebody else.

884
01:00:58,849 --> 01:01:00,889
You do?

885
01:01:02,269 --> 01:01:04,595
Hey, come on... We... we...

886
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:08,348
This was supposed to be
a temporary fling. You know that.

887
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,316
You met someone?

888
01:01:11,445 --> 01:01:14,019
Don't stare at me with those big eyes.

889
01:01:14,156 --> 01:01:19,114
You look like one of those barefoot kids
from Bolivia who needs foster parents.

890
01:01:19,245 --> 01:01:21,284
Have you been seeing someone?

891
01:01:21,414 --> 01:01:23,905
No. Yes. Someone older.

892
01:01:24,041 --> 01:01:26,248
I mean, y-y-you know, y-y-you know.

893
01:01:26,377 --> 01:01:30,209
Not as old as I am,
but in the same general ballpark as me.

894
01:01:31,924 --> 01:01:33,964
Gee, now I don't feel so good.

895
01:01:34,802 --> 01:01:38,301
It's not right. You shouldn't get hung...

896
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,637
I mean, you should open up your life.

897
01:01:40,766 --> 01:01:42,806
You know, you've got to.

898
01:01:42,935 --> 01:01:47,514
You state it like it's to my advantage,
when it's you that wants to get out of it.

899
01:01:47,648 --> 01:01:50,898
Hey, don't be so precocious, OK?
I mean, don't be so smart.

900
01:01:51,026 --> 01:01:55,320
I'm 42. My hair's falling out. I'm starting
to lose some hearing in my right ear.

901
01:01:55,447 --> 01:01:57,072
Is that what you want?

902
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:01,529
I can't believe that you met somebody
that you like better than me.

903
01:02:03,747 --> 01:02:06,321
Why should I feel guilty about this?

904
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:10,124
<i>I've always encouraged you
to go out with guys more your own age.</i>

905
01:02:10,254 --> 01:02:14,631
Kids from your class.
Billy and Biff and Scooter.

906
01:02:14,758 --> 01:02:18,542
And, you know, little Tommy or Terry.

907
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:21,135
Hey, come on, don't cry.

908
01:02:23,475 --> 01:02:25,515
Don't cry.

909
01:02:25,644 --> 01:02:27,518
Come on, don't cry.

910
01:02:27,646 --> 01:02:31,976
Tracy... Tracy, don't...
Come on. Don't cry, Tracy.

911
01:02:32,776 --> 01:02:35,861
- Tracy...
- Just leave me alone.

912
01:02:39,325 --> 01:02:41,151
Tracy, come on, don't...

913
01:02:41,285 --> 01:02:43,324
Leave me alone.

914
01:03:40,802 --> 01:03:43,472
- That was wonderful.
- I'll say.

915
01:03:43,597 --> 01:03:46,966
- I love being in the country.
- It's very relaxing.

916
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:51,893
The mosquitoes have sucked all the blood
out of my left leg. Apart from that...

917
01:03:52,022 --> 01:03:55,521
- Doesn't it make you feel better?
- Yeah, you were dynamite,

918
01:03:55,651 --> 01:03:58,687
except I felt for about
two seconds you were faking.

919
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:00,445
- Not a lot.
- No.

920
01:04:00,572 --> 01:04:04,155
Yes. When you dug your nails
into my neck, you were a little...

921
01:04:04,284 --> 01:04:06,609
Well, I guess I'm nervous around you.

922
01:04:06,745 --> 01:04:09,200
- Still?
- Well, yeah.

923
01:04:09,331 --> 01:04:12,415
- So crazy.
- Because I'd like everything to work out.

924
01:04:12,542 --> 01:04:16,492
It will. You should leave everything to me.
I'll make everything happen.

925
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:18,669
D'you really promise?

926
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:21,290
Because I like you.
I feel good around you.

927
01:04:21,426 --> 01:04:23,253
I don't blame you.

928
01:04:23,387 --> 01:04:28,132
Yeah, I mean... Yale was great, he was
absolutely great, but he was married.

929
01:04:28,266 --> 01:04:30,473
And Jeremiah, my ex-husband.

930
01:04:30,602 --> 01:04:33,686
He was just this oversexed,
brilliant kind of animal.

931
01:04:33,814 --> 01:04:37,514
- Hey, what am I? Grandma Moses?
- Not at all. No, no, no.

932
01:04:37,651 --> 01:04:40,402
- You're much different.
- Yeah?

933
01:04:40,529 --> 01:04:44,028
Yes. You're someone
I could imagine having children with.

934
01:04:44,157 --> 01:04:45,355
- Really?
- Yeah.

935
01:04:45,492 --> 01:04:47,781
Hit the lights. Go ahead. Turn 'em out.

936
01:04:47,911 --> 01:04:49,950
We'll trade fours.

937
01:05:50,724 --> 01:05:52,930
Well, we never see you any more.

938
01:05:53,059 --> 01:05:55,515
Cos I'm working on my book.
I'm submerged.

939
01:05:55,645 --> 01:05:59,180
- It's that girl. Serious, isn't it?
- Well, serious, you know.

940
01:05:59,315 --> 01:06:03,064
When are we gonna get to meet her?
I'm sure Yale'd like to meet her.

941
01:06:03,194 --> 01:06:05,068
<i>We should go out sometime.</i>

942
01:06:05,196 --> 01:06:08,565
I don't understand. Why does he
need a car? A sudden urge.

943
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,527
He just wants it.

944
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:14,740
What...? Is there nothing I can do
to dissuade you from this?

945
01:06:14,873 --> 01:06:19,914
It's so crazy. They should ban all cars
from Manhattan. I mean, this is crazy.

946
01:06:20,044 --> 01:06:23,745
Listen, Emily wants to know
why I never bring Mary around.

947
01:06:23,882 --> 01:06:25,921
Why not bring Mary around?

948
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,135
- I don't know. Is it awkward for you?
- Are you kidding?

949
01:06:29,262 --> 01:06:31,883
I spoke to her. It's no problem for her.

950
01:06:32,015 --> 01:06:33,841
- Then why not?
- Well, you know.

951
01:06:33,975 --> 01:06:38,020
Hey, don't get this thing. I hate cars.
It screws up the environment.

952
01:06:38,146 --> 01:06:40,185
- This is a work of art.
- Yeah.

953
01:06:40,315 --> 01:06:41,939
- Hi.
- Hi.

954
01:06:42,066 --> 01:06:46,146
- This is Emily.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

955
01:06:46,279 --> 01:06:48,318
- This is Yale.
- Hi, Yale.

956
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,067
So, shall we go?

957
01:06:52,869 --> 01:06:54,908
- Yeah, let's go.
- Sure.

958
01:07:39,832 --> 01:07:42,952
Look at that.
That building is almost torn down.

959
01:07:43,085 --> 01:07:45,707
Can't they have those things
declared landmarks?

960
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:47,997
Yeah, I once tried to block demolition.

961
01:07:48,132 --> 01:07:52,426
Getting some people to lay in front of a
building, and a cop stepped on my hand.

962
01:07:52,553 --> 01:07:54,925
The city's really changing.

963
01:07:55,932 --> 01:08:00,261
I need something for round the house
that doesn't make me look too Mexican.

964
01:08:00,394 --> 01:08:01,805
Ugh, this is...

965
01:08:01,938 --> 01:08:05,188
- Mary?
- Oh, my God. Jeremiah. Well...

966
01:08:05,316 --> 01:08:06,312
Hi.

967
01:08:07,693 --> 01:08:11,738
- Jeremiah, this is my friend Isaac Davis.
- Hi. Glad to meet you.

968
01:08:11,864 --> 01:08:14,320
- God, this is incredible.
- Incredible.

969
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:17,866
I'm in town for a few days.
There's a symposium on semantics.

970
01:08:17,995 --> 01:08:21,281
- Well...
- And you're looking so great. I just, uh...

971
01:08:21,415 --> 01:08:25,876
- You. You're so thin. You lost weight.
- Well, I have an exercise machine.

972
01:08:26,003 --> 01:08:28,577
Well, you really look good. Really good.

973
01:08:28,714 --> 01:08:33,460
God. Well, I'm a bit late,
but it's just so nice seeing you.

974
01:08:33,594 --> 01:08:36,630
- It's great seeing you.
- I read an article by you

975
01:08:36,764 --> 01:08:38,803
- On Brecht.
- Oh, shit! I know.

976
01:08:38,933 --> 01:08:41,887
I always was a sucker
for Germanic theatre.

977
01:08:42,019 --> 01:08:44,059
- Well...
- God.

978
01:08:44,188 --> 01:08:48,138
- OK. Well, God... OK. So long.
- Bye. Bye, Jeremiah.

979
01:08:48,275 --> 01:08:50,315
Bye. Bye.

980
01:08:51,737 --> 01:08:54,987
God, what a surprise.
I cannot get over it. My ex-husband.

981
01:08:55,116 --> 01:08:58,366
And he really does look a lot thinner.
He looks great.

982
01:08:58,494 --> 01:09:02,622
You certainly fooled me. I was shocked
cos that's not what I expected.

983
01:09:02,748 --> 01:09:07,244
- What did you expect?
- I don't know. You had always led me to...

984
01:09:07,378 --> 01:09:10,877
You said he was a ladies' man,
that he opened you up sexually.

985
01:09:11,006 --> 01:09:15,336
- So? So?
- Then this little homunculus, you know...

986
01:09:15,928 --> 01:09:18,501
He's quite devastating.

987
01:09:18,639 --> 01:09:20,263
Really?

988
01:09:20,391 --> 01:09:23,973
Well, it's... it's amazing
how subjective all that stuff is.

989
01:09:24,103 --> 01:09:25,930
I don't know what you're...

990
01:09:28,023 --> 01:09:31,226
- Boy, you're really typing away.
- Yeah, it's a cinch.

991
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,399
You still reviewing Tolstoy?

992
01:09:33,529 --> 01:09:36,980
No, no, I finished that two days ago.
I'm on that novelisation.

993
01:09:37,116 --> 01:09:40,900
What... what do you waste your time
with a novelisation for?

994
01:09:41,036 --> 01:09:43,658
Why? Because it's easy and it pays well.

995
01:09:43,789 --> 01:09:48,415
It's like another contemporary American
phenomenon that's truly moronic.

996
01:09:48,544 --> 01:09:53,502
The novelisations of movies.
You're much too brilliant for that.

997
01:09:53,632 --> 01:09:56,170
You should be doing other stuff.

998
01:09:57,052 --> 01:10:01,002
- Like what?
- Fiction. I've seen your fiction. It's terrific.

999
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:02,550
Hello?

1000
01:10:02,683 --> 01:10:04,806
Mary, hi. It's Yale.

1001
01:10:04,935 --> 01:10:07,343
I was hoping you'd pick up.

1002
01:10:07,479 --> 01:10:09,602
Listen, could we meet for coffee?

1003
01:10:09,732 --> 01:10:12,020
Well, why? What is it?

1004
01:10:12,151 --> 01:10:16,563
Well, you know, I miss you.
I just thought maybe we could talk.

1005
01:10:16,697 --> 01:10:21,323
No, I don't think that would be possible.
I don't think that would be possible at all.

1006
01:10:21,452 --> 01:10:24,951
I'm sorry, I just, uh...
No, I... I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1007
01:10:30,294 --> 01:10:32,535
- Who was that?
- What?

1008
01:10:32,671 --> 01:10:34,711
Who was that on the phone just now?

1009
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:38,754
- Uh, dance lessons.
- Dance lessons that was?!

1010
01:10:40,137 --> 01:10:42,426
Yeah. Do we want free dance lessons?

1011
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:48,848
Right. They give you one free lesson,
then they hook you for $50,000 worth.

1012
01:10:56,194 --> 01:10:59,563
Viking loved my book.
They loved the first four chapters

1013
01:10:59,698 --> 01:11:02,319
and, you know,
they were really complimentary.

1014
01:11:02,451 --> 01:11:05,238
Yale had read them
and thought they showed promise.

1015
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:08,205
<i>But Yale's family,
so of course he's encouraging.</i>

1016
01:11:08,332 --> 01:11:10,573
But Viking will shell out the money.

1017
01:11:10,709 --> 01:11:15,869
Maybe it'll inspire Yale to finish his book.
He's been talking about it long enough.

1018
01:11:16,006 --> 01:11:20,715
Mary read the stuff and she was
laughing out loud. I respect her judgment.

1019
01:11:20,844 --> 01:11:24,593
- Although she's doing a think piece on...
- Hello?

1020
01:11:24,723 --> 01:11:28,174
Hey, where were you? You were
supposed to be home an hour ago.

1021
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:31,560
- Uh... I bought the car.
- Oh, no. You did?

1022
01:11:31,688 --> 01:11:34,855
I know it's a meaningless extravagance,
but I had to have it.

1023
01:11:34,983 --> 01:11:37,023
- That thing we saw?
- Yeah.

1024
01:11:37,152 --> 01:11:40,687
Did you hear Viking Press loved
the first four chapters of lke's book?

1025
01:11:40,822 --> 01:11:42,862
- Great!
- They were real complimentary.

1026
01:11:42,991 --> 01:11:45,399
Next week I get the car
and we'll celebrate.

1027
01:11:45,535 --> 01:11:47,243
- OK.
- In our new car.

1028
01:12:40,215 --> 01:12:42,457
Jesus, listen to this.

1029
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:46,590
"Making love to this
deeper, more masterful female

1030
01:12:46,721 --> 01:12:49,758
made me realise
what an empty experience,

1031
01:12:49,891 --> 01:12:53,225
what a bizarre charade
sex with my husband was."

1032
01:12:53,353 --> 01:12:56,354
Please. That is so nauseating. I...

1033
01:12:56,481 --> 01:12:59,565
Is this true? Did you make love
with Jill and a woman?

1034
01:12:59,692 --> 01:13:01,732
She put that in?

1035
01:13:01,861 --> 01:13:05,313
Christ! She wanted to, I think.
I didn't wanna be a bad sport.

1036
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:08,153
- Did you have a good time?
- No, I didn't.

1037
01:13:08,284 --> 01:13:11,285
Did you hear the one
where he tried to run her lover over?

1038
01:13:11,412 --> 01:13:13,785
- Oh, yeah.
- Whose side are you on?

1039
01:13:13,915 --> 01:13:17,414
I didn't try and run her over.
It was raining. The car lurched.

1040
01:13:17,544 --> 01:13:21,672
Jesus, now everybody in town
is gonna know all these details.

1041
01:13:21,798 --> 01:13:24,170
Everybody... All my friends and...

1042
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:28,547
Listen. "He was given to
fits of rage, Jewish, liberal paranoia,

1043
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,550
male chauvinism,
self-righteous misanthropy,

1044
01:13:31,683 --> 01:13:33,889
and nihilistic moods of despair."

1045
01:13:34,018 --> 01:13:37,103
"He had complaints about life,
but never solutions."

1046
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:40,895
"He longed to be an artist,
but balked at the necessary sacrifices."

1047
01:13:41,025 --> 01:13:44,275
"In his most private moments,
he spoke of his fear of death

1048
01:13:44,404 --> 01:13:49,113
which he elevated to tragic heights
when, in fact, it was mere narcissism."

1049
01:13:49,242 --> 01:13:52,860
- I came here to strangle you.
- Nothing I wrote was untrue.

1050
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:55,237
You make me out to be
Lee Harvey Oswald!

1051
01:13:55,373 --> 01:13:57,200
It's an honest account.

1052
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:59,955
- That I'm narcissistic?
- You're self-obsessed.

1053
01:14:00,086 --> 01:14:04,131
- Misanthropic and self-righteous?
- I wrote some nice things about you.

1054
01:14:04,257 --> 01:14:06,084
Like what? What?

1055
01:14:06,217 --> 01:14:08,340
<i>You cry when you see
Gone With The Wind. </i>

1056
01:14:09,387 --> 01:14:11,426
What are you laughing about?

1057
01:14:11,556 --> 01:14:15,304
- You let her write that garbage?
- Wait. This is between you two.

1058
01:14:15,435 --> 01:14:18,270
D'you honestly think
that I tried to run you over?

1059
01:14:18,396 --> 01:14:21,681
You just happened to hit the gas
as I walked in front of the car.

1060
01:14:21,816 --> 01:14:25,019
- Did I do it on purpose?
- Well, what would Freud say?

1061
01:14:25,153 --> 01:14:28,438
That I really wanted to run her over.
That's why he was a genius.

1062
01:14:28,573 --> 01:14:31,111
Listen, I'm going upstairs.
I got work to do.

1063
01:14:31,242 --> 01:14:34,029
Don't forget that Willie's at ballet class.

1064
01:14:34,162 --> 01:14:36,238
Look, I better warn you.

1065
01:14:36,372 --> 01:14:39,871
I've had some interest in this book
for a movie sale.

1066
01:14:43,379 --> 01:14:45,253
Anybody home?

1067
01:14:45,381 --> 01:14:50,339
Yeah? I got an unbelievable story
to tell you. Absolutely incredible. You OK?

1068
01:14:50,469 --> 01:14:52,094
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

1069
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:55,756
Just let me get one glass of brown water
cos I'm dying of thirst.

1070
01:14:55,892 --> 01:15:00,103
<i>- Isaac, I wanna talk to you first.
- Mm-mm. So I go over to Jill's today</i>

1071
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:04,274
because I'm real annoyed over that junk
she printed in the book. And...

1072
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,314
Isaac, before you get wound up,
there's something I wanna tell you.

1073
01:15:08,446 --> 01:15:11,612
- What's the matter? You look pale.
- Well...

1074
01:15:14,285 --> 01:15:16,527
Wh... What's the matter?

1075
01:15:17,997 --> 01:15:21,200
Hey, what... Is there something wrong?
What is it?

1076
01:15:26,672 --> 01:15:29,128
I think I'm still in love with Yale.

1077
01:15:35,639 --> 01:15:37,679
What?

1078
01:15:38,851 --> 01:15:41,093
You... Are you kidd...?

1079
01:15:43,147 --> 01:15:45,816
- You are?
- Yes.

1080
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:49,612
Well, when did this happen? What...

1081
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:53,068
<i>Well, you are or you think you are?</i>

1082
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,690
I started seeing him again.

1083
01:15:55,826 --> 01:15:57,866
When? Since when?

1084
01:15:59,497 --> 01:16:03,625
Just since today. I mean,
that's why I wanted to be open about it.

1085
01:16:05,336 --> 01:16:08,372
Jesus, I'm... I'm shocked.

1086
01:16:08,506 --> 01:16:13,132
I'm... I'm shocked. I'm surprised.

1087
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:16,594
I think I've always been in love with him.

1088
01:16:16,722 --> 01:16:18,845
How does he feel about this?

1089
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:20,801
Well...

1090
01:16:21,852 --> 01:16:25,470
He wants to move out of his place
so that we can live together.

1091
01:16:25,606 --> 01:16:29,224
I'm stunned. I mean, I'm in a state of...

1092
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,610
Somebody should
throw a blanket over me. You know, I'm...

1093
01:16:32,738 --> 01:16:36,652
Well, you see, he called me several times
in a very depressed state

1094
01:16:36,784 --> 01:16:39,026
and he still loves me.

1095
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:43,788
This is shaping up like a Noel Coward
play. Somebody should go make martinis.

1096
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:46,371
I don't blame you
for being furious with me.

1097
01:16:46,502 --> 01:16:48,541
I'm too stunned to be furious.

1098
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:53,167
Well, then I wish you would. I wish you'd
get angry so that we could have it out.

1099
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,756
I don't get angry. I tend to internalise.

1100
01:16:55,886 --> 01:17:00,263
I can't express anger. That's one of the
problems I have. I grow a tumour instead.

1101
01:17:00,391 --> 01:17:05,432
Well, I told you that I was trouble from the
beginning, from when we started dating.

1102
01:17:05,562 --> 01:17:07,851
So what does your analyst say?

1103
01:17:07,981 --> 01:17:11,232
Donny's in a coma.
He had a very bad acid experience.

1104
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,895
Oh, that's gr... That's great.
I mean, you know...

1105
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:18,316
- I think you're making a big mistake here.
- Why?

1106
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:21,819
Why? Because you... Why?
Because you're preferring Yale to me.

1107
01:17:21,954 --> 01:17:25,370
I know that sounds egotistical,
but... you know...

1108
01:17:25,499 --> 01:17:29,117
This guy's been married 17 2 years.
What do you think will happen?

1109
01:17:29,253 --> 01:17:32,207
He'll be away from her for a month,
he'll go crazy.

1110
01:17:32,339 --> 01:17:36,337
And if he does commit to you, when
you start to feel secure, you'll drop him.

1111
01:17:36,468 --> 01:17:39,339
I know it.
I give the whole thing... four weeks.

1112
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:42,141
I can't plan that far in advance.

1113
01:17:42,266 --> 01:17:45,516
- You can't plan four weeks in advance?!
- No!

1114
01:17:45,644 --> 01:17:48,265
What kind of foresight is that?

1115
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:52,441
Jesus. You know, I knew you were crazy
when we started going out.

1116
01:17:52,568 --> 01:17:57,609
You always think that you're gonna be
the one that makes 'em act different, but...

1117
01:17:57,739 --> 01:18:00,361
Isaac, I'm sorry.
I really am. I'm really sorry.

1118
01:18:00,492 --> 01:18:02,734
Oh, well, I'm...

1119
01:18:02,869 --> 01:18:05,621
I'm sorr... Where are you going?

1120
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:07,787
- I gotta get some air.
- Oh.

1121
01:18:46,246 --> 01:18:47,871
What are you doing here?

1122
01:18:47,998 --> 01:18:50,240
I spoke to Mary. Were you gonna tell me?

1123
01:18:50,375 --> 01:18:54,503
- I was, but... I'm trying to teach a class.
- So where can we go and talk?

1124
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:57,714
- How'd you get past the security?
- I walked right past.

1125
01:18:57,841 --> 01:19:01,044
What are you telling me?
That you're gonna leave Emily

1126
01:19:01,178 --> 01:19:03,882
and run away with
the... the winner of the

1127
01:19:04,014 --> 01:19:06,683
Zelda Fitzgerald
Emotional Maturity Award?

1128
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:08,635
Look, I love her.

1129
01:19:08,768 --> 01:19:12,718
- What kind of crazy friend are you?
- A good friend. I introduced you two.

1130
01:19:12,856 --> 01:19:15,726
- Why? What was the point?
- Cos I thought you liked her!

1131
01:19:15,859 --> 01:19:19,559
- I do! Now we both like her!
- Yeah, well, I liked her first.

1132
01:19:19,696 --> 01:19:24,737
"I liked her first."
What are you, six years old? Jesus!

1133
01:19:24,868 --> 01:19:29,197
Look, would I have encouraged you
to take her out if I still liked her?

1134
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,572
So you liked her? Now you don't like her?

1135
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:35,159
It's early. You can change your mind
one more time before dinner.

1136
01:19:35,295 --> 01:19:38,165
Don't get sarcastic about this.
You think I like this?

1137
01:19:38,298 --> 01:19:41,168
How long were you gonna see her
without telling me?

1138
01:19:41,301 --> 01:19:44,919
Don't turn this into
one of your big moral issues.

1139
01:19:45,055 --> 01:19:49,099
You could've said, but you... All you had
to do was call me and talk to me.

1140
01:19:49,225 --> 01:19:52,926
I'm understanding. I'd have said no,
but you'd have felt honest.

1141
01:19:53,063 --> 01:19:56,681
I wanted to tell you about it.
I knew it would upset you. I...

1142
01:19:56,816 --> 01:19:59,058
We had a few innocent meetings.

1143
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:04,152
A few? She said one. You guys should get
your story straight. Don't you rehearse?

1144
01:20:04,282 --> 01:20:06,405
We met twice for coffee.

1145
01:20:06,534 --> 01:20:08,574
Hey, she doesn't drink coffee.

1146
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:12,997
Did you meet for Sanka? That's not too
romantic. A little on the geriatric side.

1147
01:20:13,124 --> 01:20:14,749
I'm not a saint, OK?

1148
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:17,545
You're too easy on yourself.
Don't you see?

1149
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:22,214
You're... You rationalise everything.
You're not honest with yourself.

1150
01:20:22,342 --> 01:20:26,838
You talk about you wanna write a book,
but in the end you'd rather buy a Porsche.

1151
01:20:26,971 --> 01:20:31,349
You cheat a little bit on Emily
and you play around the truth with me.

1152
01:20:31,476 --> 01:20:35,805
The next thing you know you're in front
of a Senate committee naming names.

1153
01:20:35,939 --> 01:20:37,765
You are so self-righteous.

1154
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:42,062
I mean, we're just people. We're just
human beings. You think you're God!

1155
01:20:42,195 --> 01:20:45,398
I gotta model myself after someone.

1156
01:20:45,532 --> 01:20:48,865
You just can't live the way you do.
It's all so perfect.

1157
01:20:48,993 --> 01:20:52,445
Jesus, what are future generations
gonna say about us? My God!

1158
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:55,250
You know, someday
we're gonna be like him.

1159
01:20:55,375 --> 01:21:00,001
And he was probably one of the beautiful
people, dancing and playing tennis.

1160
01:21:00,129 --> 01:21:02,620
And now look. This is what happens to us.

1161
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:06,458
You know, it's important
to have some kind of personal integrity.

1162
01:21:06,594 --> 01:21:09,085
I'll be hanging in a classroom one day

1163
01:21:09,222 --> 01:21:14,014
and I wanna make sure when I thin out
that I'm... well thought of.

1164
01:21:14,143 --> 01:21:15,554
Ike!

1165
01:21:15,687 --> 01:21:17,810
Isaac, where are you going?

1166
01:22:11,284 --> 01:22:13,953
No, I knew Yale had affairs.

1167
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:17,035
But then, nothing's perfect.

1168
01:22:17,164 --> 01:22:21,910
Marriage is a... requires
some minor compromises, I guess.

1169
01:22:22,044 --> 01:22:25,129
It's funny cos I'm just a non-compromiser.

1170
01:22:25,256 --> 01:22:28,126
I mean, I can't... I can't see that.

1171
01:22:28,259 --> 01:22:33,846
I think it's always a mistake to look the
other way cos you pay for it in the end.

1172
01:22:33,973 --> 01:22:37,306
But then you saw what Jill
wrote about me in that book.

1173
01:22:37,435 --> 01:22:39,474
I'm living in the past.

1174
01:22:39,603 --> 01:22:41,726
How about you? You seeing anybody?

1175
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:46,683
Yeah. You know, I... I never had any
problem meeting women. I mean, that's...

1176
01:22:46,819 --> 01:22:49,903
But I was thinking about this
just about a week ago.

1177
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:54,776
I think, and I know this sounds strange,
but I think I really missed a good bet

1178
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:56,950
when I let Tracy go.

1179
01:22:57,079 --> 01:22:59,321
- Remember Tracy?
- Yeah. I liked her.

1180
01:22:59,457 --> 01:23:02,458
Yeah. I was thinking about this
at home last week

1181
01:23:02,585 --> 01:23:06,333
and I think, of all the women
I've known over the last years,

1182
01:23:06,464 --> 01:23:11,256
when I actually am honest with myself,
I think I had the most relaxed times

1183
01:23:11,385 --> 01:23:14,137
and, you know, the nicest times with her.

1184
01:23:14,263 --> 01:23:16,552
She was a terrific kid, but young, right?

1185
01:23:16,724 --> 01:23:18,763
So that's that.

1186
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:20,932
Why don't you call her?

1187
01:23:21,061 --> 01:23:23,979
No, I would never do that.
I think I blew that one.

1188
01:23:24,106 --> 01:23:27,522
I kept her at a distance
and I would never give her a chance.

1189
01:23:27,651 --> 01:23:31,566
And she was so sweet, you know.

1190
01:23:31,697 --> 01:23:35,647
She called me. She left a message
with my service about a month ago

1191
01:23:35,784 --> 01:23:41,657
<i>that I should watch Grand Illusion
on television and I never returned her call.</i>

1192
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:44,875
Cos l, you know, I didn't wanna
lead her on or anything.

1193
01:23:45,002 --> 01:23:47,244
She really cared about me and I...

1194
01:23:48,631 --> 01:23:50,919
You know I was a little pissed off at you.

1195
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:52,460
Me?

1196
01:23:52,593 --> 01:23:57,385
I figured if you hadn't introduced Mary
to Yale, this might never have happened.

1197
01:24:00,893 --> 01:24:05,851
An idea for a short story
about, um, people in Manhattan

1198
01:24:05,981 --> 01:24:08,651
who are constantly creating

1199
01:24:08,776 --> 01:24:13,319
these real, unnecessary,
neurotic problems for themselves

1200
01:24:13,447 --> 01:24:19,366
cos it keeps them from dealing with
more unsolvable, terrifying problems

1201
01:24:19,495 --> 01:24:21,867
about... the universe.

1202
01:24:24,375 --> 01:24:26,747
Let's...
Well, it has to be optimistic.

1203
01:24:26,877 --> 01:24:30,744
Well, all right, why is life worth living?
That's a very good question.

1204
01:24:33,383 --> 01:24:37,713
Well, there are certain things, I guess,
that make it worthwhile.

1205
01:24:39,264 --> 01:24:40,675
Like what?

1206
01:24:41,266 --> 01:24:46,059
OK... for me...

1207
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:52,567
Ooh, I would say Groucho Marx,
to name one thing.

1208
01:24:54,404 --> 01:24:56,480
And Willie Mays.

1209
01:24:56,615 --> 01:25:02,202
And... the second movement
of the Jupiter Symphony.

1210
01:25:02,913 --> 01:25:08,702
<i>And... Louis Armstrong's
recording of Potato Head Blues. </i>

1211
01:25:10,879 --> 01:25:12,671
Swedish movies, naturally.

1212
01:25:12,798 --> 01:25:15,715
<i>Sentimental Education by Flaubert.</i>

1213
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:18,918
Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra.

1214
01:25:20,555 --> 01:25:26,060
Those incredible
apples and pears by C?anne.

1215
01:25:27,729 --> 01:25:29,603
The crabs at Sam Wo's.

1216
01:25:32,359 --> 01:25:35,064
Tracy's face.

1217
01:29:17,625 --> 01:29:18,704
Hi.

1218
01:29:18,918 --> 01:29:20,745
Hi.

1219
01:29:21,754 --> 01:29:23,379
I...

1220
01:29:23,506 --> 01:29:25,545
What are you doing here?

1221
01:29:25,716 --> 01:29:28,386
Well, I ran.

1222
01:29:29,136 --> 01:29:32,470
I tried to call you on the phone,
but... it was busy

1223
01:29:32,598 --> 01:29:35,967
so I knew that was two hours' worth of...

1224
01:29:36,102 --> 01:29:38,557
So I couldn't get a taxi cab, so I ran.

1225
01:29:42,233 --> 01:29:44,272
Where you going?

1226
01:29:44,402 --> 01:29:46,228
London.

1227
01:29:46,946 --> 01:29:48,985
You're going to London now?

1228
01:29:49,115 --> 01:29:53,611
What d'you... What d'you mean? If I got
over here two minutes later, you'd be...

1229
01:29:53,744 --> 01:29:55,784
...you'd be going to London?

1230
01:30:01,085 --> 01:30:04,086
Well, let me get right to the point then.

1231
01:30:04,213 --> 01:30:06,040
I don't think you oughta go.

1232
01:30:06,173 --> 01:30:10,041
I think I made a big mistake.
and I would prefer it if you didn't go.

1233
01:30:10,177 --> 01:30:12,217
Oh, Isaac.

1234
01:30:12,346 --> 01:30:16,759
I mean it. I know it looks real bad now,
but, uh, you know, it...

1235
01:30:16,892 --> 01:30:19,810
Are you seeing anybody?
Are you going with anybody?

1236
01:30:19,937 --> 01:30:21,348
No.

1237
01:30:22,481 --> 01:30:24,521
So... well...

1238
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:28,564
D'you still love me,
or has that worn off or what?

1239
01:30:30,322 --> 01:30:32,362
Jesus, you... pop up...

1240
01:30:33,325 --> 01:30:36,362
You don't call me
and then you suddenly appear.

1241
01:30:36,996 --> 01:30:40,661
I mean... What happened
to that woman you met?

1242
01:30:40,791 --> 01:30:44,492
Well, I'll tell you,
I don't see her any more.

1243
01:30:44,628 --> 01:30:48,329
I made a mistake.
What d'you want me to say?

1244
01:30:49,383 --> 01:30:51,839
I don't think you oughta go to London.

1245
01:30:54,555 --> 01:30:56,761
Well, I have to go.

1246
01:30:56,891 --> 01:30:59,726
I mean, all the plans have been made,
arrangements.

1247
01:30:59,852 --> 01:31:04,312
I mean, my parents are there now
looking for a place for me to live.

1248
01:31:06,275 --> 01:31:08,314
Well...

1249
01:31:08,444 --> 01:31:11,314
Do you still love me or what?

1250
01:31:12,823 --> 01:31:14,863
Do you love me?

1251
01:31:15,409 --> 01:31:17,865
Well, yeah, that's what... Of course.

1252
01:31:17,995 --> 01:31:20,664
That's what this is all about, you know.

1253
01:31:20,789 --> 01:31:23,576
- Guess what? I turned 178 the other day.
- Did you?

1254
01:31:23,709 --> 01:31:25,915
I'm legal, but I'm still a kid.

1255
01:31:26,045 --> 01:31:29,045
You're not such a kid. 178 years old.

1256
01:31:29,214 --> 01:31:32,500
They could draft you.
In some countries you'd be...

1257
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:38,506
- You look good.
- You really hurt me.

1258
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,716
It was not on purpose, you know.

1259
01:31:40,851 --> 01:31:44,137
I mean, I...
You know, it was... I mean...

1260
01:31:45,022 --> 01:31:47,976
It was just the way
I was looking at things then.

1261
01:31:48,108 --> 01:31:50,646
Well, I'll be back in six months.

1262
01:31:50,778 --> 01:31:53,233
Six months! Are you kidding?

1263
01:31:53,947 --> 01:31:56,189
Six months you're gonna go for?

1264
01:31:57,409 --> 01:32:02,830
We've gone this long. I mean, what's
six months if we still love each other?

1265
01:32:02,956 --> 01:32:04,996
Hey, don't be so mature, OK?

1266
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:07,794
I mean, six months is a long time.
Six months!

1267
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:13,625
You're gonna be in the thea... working
in the theatre with actors and directors.

1268
01:32:13,759 --> 01:32:17,591
You know, you go to rehearsal
and you hang out with those people.

1269
01:32:17,721 --> 01:32:23,308
You have lunch a lot and before you know
it attachments form and... you know...

1270
01:32:23,435 --> 01:32:27,136
I mean, you don't wanna get into that...
You'll change.

1271
01:32:27,272 --> 01:32:30,357
In six months you'll be
a completely different person.

1272
01:32:30,484 --> 01:32:33,734
Well, don't you want me
to have that experience?

1273
01:32:33,862 --> 01:32:37,065
I mean, a while ago
you made such a convincing case.

1274
01:32:39,159 --> 01:32:42,445
Yeah, of course I do, but, you know...

1275
01:32:42,579 --> 01:32:46,908
I mean, I just don't want that thing
about you that I like to change.

1276
01:32:51,338 --> 01:32:53,496
I've gotta make a plane.

1277
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:56,586
Come on, you don't... Come on.

1278
01:32:56,718 --> 01:32:59,090
You don't... You don't have to go.

1279
01:33:00,138 --> 01:33:03,424
Why couldn't you have
brought this up last week?

1280
01:33:06,144 --> 01:33:08,516
Six months isn't so long.

1281
01:33:10,315 --> 01:33:12,771
Not everybody gets corrupted.

1282
01:33:14,903 --> 01:33:18,354
You have to have a little faith in people.
