00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,719
"What was it?
A meteorite?

21
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,277
A visit of inhabitants
of the cosmic abyss?

22
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,274
One way or another,
our small country

23
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,478
has seen the birth of a miracle -
the Zone.

24
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,638
We immediately sent troops there.

25
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,796
They haven't come back.

26
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,959
Then we surrounded the Zone
with police cordons...

27
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,119
Perhaps, that was the right thing to
do. Though, I don't know... "

28
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,278
From an interview with Nobel Prize
winner, Professor Wallace.

29
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,118
Why did you take my watch?

30
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,875
Where are you going, I'm asking you?

31
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,119
You gave me your word
and I believed you.

32
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,354
All right, you're not thinking about
yourself, but what about us?

33
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,877
Did you think about your child?

34
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,788
She's just getting used to you,
and you start it again!

35
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,550
You've made an old woman of me.
You've ruined my life.

36
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,480
Not so loud, you'll wake up
Monkey.

37
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,557
I can't wait for you forever.
I'm going to die!

38
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,117
You wanted to start working!

39
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,480
You've been promised
a normal human work!

40
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,033
I'll be back soon.

41
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,638
You'll be back to prison!

42
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,469
Though this time you'll get
ten years, not five!

43
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,798
And for ten years you will have
neither your Zone, nor anything!

44
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,355
And I'll be dead in the meantime.

45
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,790
Oh God, for me it's prison
everywhere!

46
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,118
- Let me go!
- No!

47
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,798
Let go, I said!

48
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,110
Go!
And may you rot there!

49
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,550
Be damned the day
when I met you, bastard!

50
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,116
God himself has cursed you
by giving you this child!

51
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,199
And me too, because of you, jerk!

52
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,355
My dear,
our world is hopelessly boring.

53
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,792
Therefore, there can be no telepathy,
or apparitions, or flying saucers,

54
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,116
nothing like that.

55
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,356
The world is ruled by cast-iron laws,
and it's insufferably boring.

56
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,710
Alas, those laws are never violated.

57
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,717
They don't know how to be violated.

58
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,878
So don't even hope for a UFO,
that would have been too interesting.

59
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,029
And how about the Bermuda Triangle?
You're not going to deny...

60
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,028
I am. There is no Bermuda Triangle.

61
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,870
There's only Triangle ABC that equals
Triangle A-prim, B-prim, C-prim.

62
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,876
Do you feel the boredom
contained in this assertion?

63
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,275
To live in the Middle Ages was
interesting.

64
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,118
Every home had its house-spirit,
and every church had its God.

65
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,551
People were young!
Now every fourth is an old person.

66
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,875
It's so boring, my angel.

67
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,038
But you said that the Zone

68
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,549
was the product of a superior
civilization...

69
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,117
It must be boring, too,
all those laws, triangles,

70
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,036
and no house spirits,
and no God, that's for certain.

71
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,354
Because if God is also
a triangle,

72
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,716
then I don't know what to think.

73
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,789
It's for me! Great!

74
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,560
Goodbye, my dear friend.

75
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,557
This lady was so kind as to agree
to go with us to the Zone.

76
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,274
She's a very courageous woman.
Her name is...

77
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,477
I beg your pardon, your name is..?

78
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,469
Are you really a stalker?

79
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,478
Wait... I'll explain everything.

80
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,115
Go...

81
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,555
What a cretin!

82
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,639
You did get drunk after all.

83
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,795
Me? What do you mean?

84
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,549
I had a drink, like one half
of the population does.

85
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,548
The other half gets drunk.
Including women and children.

86
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,479
I just had a drink though.

87
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,875
Damn it, what a mess here.

88
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,958
Go on, drink. We've got time.

89
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,877
How about a glass for the road?

90
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,193
What do you think?

91
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,955
Take it away.

92
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,110
I see. Dry law.
Alcoholism is a scourge of mankind.

93
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,273
All right, we'll drink beer.

94
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,479
Is he with us?

95
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,877
Never mind, he'll sober up.
He needs to go there, too.

96
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,716
Are you really a professor?

97
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,194
If you don't mind.

98
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,552
Then let me introduce myself.
My name is...

99
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,113
Your name is Writer.

100
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,037
Well. And what is my name?

101
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,875
Yours? Professor.

102
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,958
I see. I'm a writer,

103
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,958
so, naturally, everyone calls me
Writer for some reason.

104
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,797
- And what do you write about?
- About the readers.

105
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,468
Obviously, there's nothing else
one should write about.

106
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,558
One should write about nothing at all.

107
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,275
And what are you? A chemist?

108
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,874
A physicist rather.

109
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,472
That must be boring, too.
Searching for the truth.

110
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,038
It's hiding and you keep searching
for it.

111
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,028
You dig in one place - eureka!
The nucleus is made of protons.

112
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,196
You dig in another - great!

113
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,109
Triangle ABC equals
Triangle A-prim, B-prim, C-prim.

114
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,877
With me it's quite different.

115
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,268
While I am digging for the truth,
so much happens to it

116
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,876
that instead of discovering the truth

117
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,869
I dig up a heap of, pardon...
I'd better not name it.

118
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,194
You're lucky!

119
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,958
But imagine some antique pot
displayed in a museum.

120
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,436
It was used at its time
as a receptacle of food leftovers,

121
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,630
but now it's an object of
universal admiration

122
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,798
for its laconic pattern
and unique form.

123
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,033
Everyone goes oh! and ah!

124
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,717
And suddenly it turns out
that it's not antique at all,

125
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,548
that some joker has palmed it off
on the archeologists

126
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,874
just for fun.

127
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,198
Strange as it may seem, the admiration
dies off. Those connoisseurs...

128
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,715
Is it what you think about
all the time?

129
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,434
God forbid!

130
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,549
In fact, I don't think much.
It's not good for me.

131
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,711
It's impossible to write, thinking
all the time of success or failure.

132
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:38,040
Naturlich! But if no one is going
to read me in one hundred years,

133
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,196
why the hell should I write at all?

134
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,790
Tell me, Professor, why did you let
yourself be mixed up in all this?

135
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,559
What do you need the Zone for?

136
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,637
I'm a scientist in some sense.

137
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,559
But what do you need it for?

138
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,719
You're an "in" writer.

139
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,639
Women must be running after you
in flocks.

140
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,277
My inspiration has been lost,
Professor. I go begging for it.

141
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,877
Have you been used up?

142
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,868
What?
Yes, I guess, in a way.

143
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,037
Do you hear it? Our train.

144
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,039
- Have you taken the roof off the car?
- Yes, I have.

145
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:51,028
Luger, if I don't come back,
call on my wife.

146
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,789
Damn it, I forgot to buy cigarettes.

147
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,113
Don't go back.

148
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,470
- Why?
- You must not.

149
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,470
- You're all like this.
- Like what?

150
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,356
Believing such nonsense.

151
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,796
Well, I'd better leave it for a rainy
day.

152
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,038
Are you really a scientist?

153
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,635
Down!

154
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,555
Don't move!

155
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,878
Go and look, is there anyone there?

156
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,477
Move it, for God's sake!

157
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,355
There's no one there.

158
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,479
Go to the other exit.

159
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,352
Where on earth did you look, Writer?

160
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,638
- You didn't forget the jerry can?
- No. It's full.

161
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,196
Everything I told you before...

162
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,632
is a lie.
I don't give a damn about inspiration.

163
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:59,870
How would I know
the right word for what I want?

164
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,195
How would I know that actually
I don't want what I want?

165
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,038
Or that I actually don't want
what I don't want?

166
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,116
They are elusive things:

167
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,470
the moment we name them,
their meaning disappears,

168
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,878
melts, dissolves
like a jellyfish in the sun.

169
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,472
My conscience wants vegetarianism
to win over the world.

170
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,958
And my subconscious is yearning
for a piece of juicy meat.

171
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,639
But what do I want?

172
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,879
World domination.

173
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,717
Quiet!

174
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,956
Why a diesel locomotive in the Zone?

175
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,278
It services the outpost.
It won't go any farther.

176
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,958
They don't like going there.

177
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,878
Take your places!
Everybody here?

178
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,274
The guards have arrived.
Tell them to turn the TV off.

179
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,875
Hurry!

180
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,869
Go look if there's a trolley
on the tracks.

181
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,275
What trolley?

182
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,112
Go back, I'll do it.

183
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,115
The jerry can!

184
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,035
Give it to me!

185
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,880
Get rid of your knapsack,
it's hampering you.

186
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,435
You may travel light, if you wish,
as if going for a stroll.

187
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,198
If someone gets hit,
don't shout or rush about.

188
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,549
If they see you, they'll kill you.

189
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,116
When everything settles down,
crawl back to the outpost.

190
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,355
They'll pick you up in the morning.

191
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,038
Can they catch up with us?

192
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,277
They fear it like the plague.

193
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,715
Fear what?

194
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,196
Here we are... home, at last.

195
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,355
How quiet it is.

196
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:02,872
This is the quietest place in
the world. You'll see for yourselves.

197
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,277
So beautiful here.
Not a single soul here.

198
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,195
What about us?

199
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,278
Three men can't spoil the place
in one day.

200
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,550
Why? They can.

201
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,877
It's strange that flowers don't
smell. Or have l...

202
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,273
Do you feel anything?

203
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,710
I feel the stench of the bog.

204
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,354
No, that's the river. There's a river
here.

205
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:38,472
There was a flower-bed nearby,
but Porcupine had trampled it down.

206
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,712
The smell lingered
for many years though.

207
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,868
Why did he do it?

208
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,795
I don't know.

209
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,638
I asked him why, too.

210
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,716
And he said:
"You'll understand later."

211
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,799
I think he just came to hate the Zone.

212
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,876
Porcupine, that's his name?

213
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,114
A nickname, like yours.

214
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,718
He had been taking people to the Zone
for years, and no one could stop him.

215
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,028
He was my teacher.
He opened my eyes.

216
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,438
He was called Teacher then,
not Porcupine.

217
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,356
Then something happened to him,
something broke in him.

218
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,356
Though I think
he was punished.

219
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,469
Will you help me? Tie those strips
of bandage to the nuts.

220
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,116
And l... will go for a walk.

221
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,469
I need to do something...

222
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,039
Don't go anywhere.

223
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,274
Where's he going?

224
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,796
He wants to be alone, I guess.

225
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,357
Why? Even with the three of us
together, I feel weird.

226
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,194
A date with the Zone.
He's a stalker.

227
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,718
And what does that mean?

228
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,469
You see, being a stalker
is some sort of calling.

229
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,797
- I thought he'd be different.
- Like what?

230
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,278
Well, you know, the Leather Stockings,
Chingachgook sort of things...

231
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,559
His background is even more frightful.

232
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,278
Several times in prison,
then he was harmed here.

233
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,116
He has a mutant daughter,
"a victim of the Zone" as they call it.

234
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,548
They say she's got no legs.

235
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,354
And what about this Porcupine?

236
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,709
What does it mean, "was punished"?

237
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,353
Or was it just a figure of speech?

238
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,871
One day Porcupine returned from here

239
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,116
and got rich overnight.

240
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,638
Fabulously rich.

241
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,478
You call it punishment?

242
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,470
A week later he hanged himself.

243
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,275
Why?

244
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,035
Quiet!

245
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,878
What was that?

246
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,471
Presumably a meteorite fell down
here about twenty years ago.

247
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,878
It had burned down the settlement.

248
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,109
They searched for this meteorite,
but never found it, of course.

249
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,070
Why "of course"?

250
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,875
Then people began disappearing here.

251
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,390
They came here and never returned.

252
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,558
So it was concluded...

253
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,878
that this meteorite
was not really a meteorite.

254
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,353
At first...

255
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:14,188
they circled the place with barbed
wire to scare off the inquisitive.

256
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,791
All this gave rise to rumours
that there's a place in the Zone...

257
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,752
where wishes come true.

258
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:33,630
Naturally, they began to guard
the Zone like the apple of their eye.

259
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,116
Who knows what kind of wish
someone might cherish.

260
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,957
What was it if not a meteorite?

261
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,879
I told you, no one knows.

262
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,715
And what do you think?

263
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,717
Nothing.
Or anything.

264
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,710
A message to mankind,
as one of my colleagues says.

265
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,873
Or a gift.

266
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,478
Some gift.

267
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,797
Why on earth would they do it?

268
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,638
To make us happy.

269
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,959
The flowers are blooming again,
but they don't smell for some reason.

270
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,870
Sorry for leaving you two here,
but it was too early to go anyway.

271
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,315
Did you hear it?

272
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,716
Maybe someone lives here?

273
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,115
Who?

274
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,550
You told me yourself

275
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,276
about some tourists camped here
when the Zone originated.

276
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,355
There's no one in the Zone and
there can't be.

277
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,799
Well, it's time.

278
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,878
How are we going to return?

279
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,196
- They don't return here.
- What do you mean?

280
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,516
We'll go as we agreed.

281
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,276
I'll show the direction.

282
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,876
Any deviation from it is dangerous.

283
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,596
The first landmark is that last pole.

284
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,753
You go first, Professor.

285
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,955
Now you.

286
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,196
Try to follow in his footsteps.

287
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,880
Oh, my God! And where are...

288
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,519
Did they remain here like that?
Those people?

289
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,274
Who knows.

290
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,760
I remember them packing at the station,
getting ready to come here.

291
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,118
I was just a boy.

292
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,868
We all thought then
that somebody wanted to conquer us.

293
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,039
You first, Professor.

294
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,515
Now you, Writer.

295
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,116
Your room is over there.
We'll go this way.

296
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:08,559
Why were you hiking up the price?
It's so close at hand.

297
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,118
Yes, but the hand
has to be very long.

298
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,115
We don't have such a hand.

299
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,879
Don't! Leave it alone!

300
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,716
Don't touch it!

301
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,033
Don't touch it, I said!

302
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,879
Are you crazy? What's the matter
with you?

303
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,396
It's not the place for leisurely
strolls.

304
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,469
The Zone wants to be respected.
Otherwise it will punish.

305
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:49,629
Don't you ever try it again...
Have you no tongue or what?

306
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,955
I warned you, didn't l?

307
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,715
Are we to go there?

308
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,198
Yes. Up, enter it and to the left.

309
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,951
Only we are not going this way.
We'll go around.

310
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,469
Why?

311
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,115
People don't go this way.

312
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,435
In the Zone, the longer way,
the less risk.

313
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,477
And to go straight ahead is fatal?

314
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,193
He told you it's dangerous.

315
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,870
- And making a detour's not dangerous?
- It is. But they don't go this way.

316
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,038
What do I care that they don't?
What if I take a chance...

317
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,719
Listen, what's the matter with you...

318
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,117
To go all the way around!
When everything's so close.

319
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,797
Here a risk, there a risk.
What the hell!

320
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,117
You're being very flippant
about this.

321
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,629
I'm fed up with all those nuts
and bandages.

322
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,472
You may do as you wish,
but I'm going.

323
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,628
- You're insane.
- It's you who are...

324
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,953
May l?

325
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,033
The wind is coming up...

326
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,468
Can you feel it? The grass...

327
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,196
All the more so.

328
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,353
What do you mean?

329
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,355
Wait!

330
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,874
Keep your hands off!

331
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,473
Professor be my witness,
I didn't sent you there.

332
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,716
You go of your own will.

333
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,876
Of my own will. What else?

334
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,195
Nothing. Go.

335
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,638
God help you to be lucky.

336
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,469
Listen!

337
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,629
Should you notice something,

338
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,118
or just feel something,

339
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,788
go back at once, or...

340
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,719
Just don't throw iron poles at me.

341
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,559
Stop! Don't move!

342
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,478
- Why did you do it?
- Why did I do what?

343
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,789
- Why did you stop him?
- I thought it was you...

344
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,039
What's up?
Why did you stop me?

345
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,194
I didn't stop you.

346
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,550
Who did it then? You?

347
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,398
Who the hell knows...

348
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,354
You're smart, Mister Shakespeare.

349
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,195
To go straight ahead is scary,
to go back is embarrassing.

350
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:00,960
So you gave yourself a command.
Fear has made you come to your senses.

351
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,273
- What?
- Stop it.

352
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,877
- Why have you emptied the bottle?
- Stop it, I said!

353
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,473
The Zone is a very complicated system...

354
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,790
of traps,
and they're all deadly.

355
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,354
I don't know what's going on here
in the absence of people,

356
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:44,268
but the moment someone shows up,
everything comes into motion.

357
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,354
Old traps disappear
and new ones emerge.

358
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,628
Safe spots
become impassable.

359
00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:00,030
Now your path is easy,
now it's hopelessly involved.

360
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,794
That's the Zone.

361
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,551
It may even seem capricious.

362
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,789
But it is what we've made it
with our condition.

363
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,948
It happened that people had
to stop halfway and go back.

364
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,637
Some of them even died
on the very threshold of the room.

365
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,878
But everything that's going on here
depends not on the Zone, but on us!

366
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,796
So it lets the good ones pass
and kills the bad ones?

367
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,798
I don't know.

368
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,275
I think
it lets those pass who...

369
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,196
have lost all hope.

370
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,468
Not good or bad,
but wretched people.

371
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:54,629
But even the most wretched will die
if they don't know how to behave.

372
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,631
You have been lucky,
it just warned you.

373
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,720
I guess I'll wait for you here

374
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:20,630
until you come back,
made happy.

375
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,953
It's impossible!

376
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,118
I've got sandwiches, a thermos...

377
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,709
You won't last even an hour here
without me.

378
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,198
Besides, one doesn't return here
the way one comes.

379
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,477
Anyway, I would prefer...

380
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,875
Then we're going back right away.

381
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,468
I'll return your money
minus a certain sum

382
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,559
for the trouble, so to speak...

383
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,431
Have you come to your senses,
Professor?

384
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,273
All right. Go on, throw your nut.
