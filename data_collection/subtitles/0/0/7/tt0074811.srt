1
00:02:32,163 --> 00:02:36,361
Quiet, Mirza.
Mirza, quiet now.

2
00:02:36,434 --> 00:02:39,130
Afternoon, madame.

3
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:41,194
- Yes, what is it?
- I'm sorry to bother you.

4
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:44,469
I was told about an apartment.

5
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:51,509
This is the right building
though, isn't it?

6
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:53,516
Who told you?

7
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:55,609
A friend of mine.

8
00:02:55,686 --> 00:02:58,416
Uh, well, a relation, actually.

9
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,684
- The door.
- Sorry.

10
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:04,089
I gather it's a small
two-room apartment.

11
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:06,095
Think that's all I got to do?

12
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:09,098
Some people think a concierge
is a slave.

13
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,100
Not me, not me, I assure you.

14
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:13,898
Would it be more convenient
if I came back later?

15
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:17,498
Anyway, you have to
speak with Monsieur Zy.

16
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:20,976
- I can only show the apartment.
- I don't want to be a nuisance...

17
00:03:21,045 --> 00:03:24,173
but if it were at all possible...

18
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:27,644
and if I might offer you some...

19
00:03:27,778 --> 00:03:31,077
small compensation for your
trouble which is only reasonable.

20
00:03:36,186 --> 00:03:38,984
What a lovely little doggie you are.

21
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:41,456
You're Mirza, aren't you?

22
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:46,394
It's a nice name, Mirza.

23
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:00,743
I'm sorry.

24
00:05:19,156 --> 00:05:21,784
The previous tenant
threw herself out of the window.

25
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:27,296
You can still see where she fell.

26
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:31,066
Look.

27
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,466
He's gonna have to fix that.

28
00:05:39,543 --> 00:05:42,034
She's not dead yet...

29
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:44,205
though she might as well be.

30
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:47,580
She's in the Bretonneau hospital.

31
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:50,142
What if she gets better?

32
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,018
Don't worry.
She won't get better.

33
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,422
You know,
you're onto a good thing here.

34
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:58,586
Poor woman.
What are the terms? Do you know?

35
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:01,563
Well, there's a fee for the water.
All the plumbing is new.

36
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:04,362
You used to have to go out
to the landing to get water.

37
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:06,368
- And the toilet?
- It's right over there.

38
00:06:06,436 --> 00:06:09,894
You just go around the corridor,
and there it is.

39
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:13,670
That's a view worth looking at.

40
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:20,449
How much is the premium?

41
00:06:20,517 --> 00:06:23,111
The rent is 600 francs a month.

42
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:26,519
Uh, the premium,
I'm not sure about.

43
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,855
I think he wants 5,000 francs.

44
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:33,488
Five thousand?
That's a lot of money.

45
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:37,261
It's not my business. For that
you'll have to talk to Monsieur Zy.

46
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:39,268
He lives right down here.

47
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:43,598
I have to get back now.

48
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:17,640
All right, all right.
We're not deaf.

49
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,177
- We don't give to charity.
- It's about the apartment.

50
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:25,180
What apartment?

51
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:29,344
On the floor above.
Could I speak to Monsieur Zy?

52
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,584
Afternoon.

53
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:13,925
Have you seen the apartment?

54
00:08:13,997 --> 00:08:17,933
Yes. That's why I wanted to talk
to you, to discuss the terms.

55
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:23,204
Five thousand premium,
six hundred a month.

56
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:27,004
That's a lot of money.
I couldn't pay more than 4,000.

57
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:33,906
The concierge told you
about the water?

58
00:08:33,984 --> 00:08:36,646
Yes, she did.

59
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,087
It's damned hard to find
an apartment these days, you know.

60
00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:42,091
There's a student up
on the sixth floor...

61
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,719
gave me half that much
for a single room.

62
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:48,697
Don't get me wrong. I'm not trying
to criticize your apartment...

63
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:51,131
but the toilet is a problem.

64
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:55,331
Suppose I got sick... which I don't
often do, I can assure you...

65
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:58,238
and I had to relieve myself
in the middle of the night.

66
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:01,604
It wouldn't be
very convenient, would it?

67
00:09:01,678 --> 00:09:06,877
On the other hand, I could pay you
the 4,000 right away, in cash.

68
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,248
It's not only a question
of the money.

69
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:12,482
- Let's be clear, Monsieur...
- Trelkovsky.

70
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:16,286
Trelkovsky.

71
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:19,726
I won't exactly starve
without your 5,000.

72
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:22,230
No. I'm renting the apartment
because it's vacant...

73
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:24,733
and because I know
they don't grow on trees.

74
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:26,735
Of course, Monsieur Zy.

75
00:09:26,803 --> 00:09:29,237
It's perfectly reasonable.
I understand your point.

76
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:31,866
Could I offer you a cigarette?

77
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:34,069
You want 5,000, fine.

78
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:37,910
But if you got paid by check,
you'd have to declare it.

79
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:41,246
Wouldn't you rather
get 4,000 in cash?

80
00:09:41,318 --> 00:09:44,913
I'd rather get 5,000 in cash
than 4,000 in cash.

81
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:49,291
It's perfectly natural.

82
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:53,193
Anyway, the former tenant
is not dead yet.

83
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:56,960
If she comes back, you won't even
get your 4,000. You get nothing.

84
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:59,501
Are you married?
Excuse the question...

85
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:01,799
but it's because of the children.

86
00:10:01,872 --> 00:10:04,432
This is a very quiet building.

87
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:08,501
- My wife and I are getting on...
- I wouldn't say that, Monsieur Zy.

88
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:10,011
I know what I'm saying.

89
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,640
My wife and I are getting on.
We don't like a lot of noise.

90
00:10:12,716 --> 00:10:14,650
You needn't worry, Monsieur Zy.

91
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:17,278
I am very quiet myself,
and I am a bachelor.

92
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:21,656
Bachelors can be a problem too.

93
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:25,161
If you're looking for a place
to entertain your girlfriends...

94
00:10:25,228 --> 00:10:27,886
I'd rather take 2,000 and give
it to somebody who really needs it.

95
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,921
I quite agree,
but I am not that type.

96
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,720
Well now, I can't give you
a definite answer...

97
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:37,353
while Mademoiselle Choule
is still alive.

98
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,556
But I like you.

99
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:42,533
You seem to be
a serious young man to me.

100
00:10:58,984 --> 00:11:02,476
I want to visit
Mademoiselle Choule.

101
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:12,930
- Simone Choule?
- That's right.

102
00:11:12,998 --> 00:11:15,933
- Are you a relative?
- I'm a friend.

103
00:11:27,846 --> 00:11:30,280
Can I help you?

104
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:32,374
- Are you the head nurse, ma'am?
- Yes.

105
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:33,884
I'm very glad I found you...

106
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:36,386
because I was told at the
reception desk to see you first.

107
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:40,619
- It's about Mademoiselle Choule.
- Bed 18.

108
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:43,423
- May I see her?
- She's not to be disturbed.

109
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,656
She was in a coma till yesterday.

110
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:48,199
Go ahead,
but don't try to talk to her.

111
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:31,107
Are you a friend of hers?

112
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:33,406
Excuse me.

113
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:42,846
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.

114
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:46,353
I was with her the night before.

115
00:12:46,425 --> 00:12:49,155
No, two nights before.

116
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:51,458
She was in such good spirits.

117
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,897
Why would she do a thing like that?

118
00:12:55,968 --> 00:12:58,766
To tell you the truth,
I'm not a close... l...

119
00:12:58,837 --> 00:13:01,271
I hardly know her at all,
actually, but believe me...

120
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,274
I'm terribly upset about...

121
00:13:03,342 --> 00:13:05,276
- Yeah.
- What's happened.

122
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:08,479
It's awful.

123
00:13:09,782 --> 00:13:14,242
Simone? Simone.

124
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:19,347
You do recognize me, don't you?
It's me, Stella.

125
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,791
Your friend, Stella.

126
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:25,386
Don't you recognize me?

127
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,131
You'll have to leave now.

128
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:39,370
Your bag.

129
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,912
Is there any hope of saving her?

130
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,347
What do you mean?
If we can save her, we save her.

131
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:13,443
Careful. You mustn't
give in to your grief.

132
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:19,775
Huh? If you like, we could go
and have something to drink.

133
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:21,786
I think it would help you.

134
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:25,189
There is a...

135
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:36,161
Here.

136
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:47,935
What would you like to drink?

137
00:14:50,082 --> 00:14:52,016
I don't know.

138
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:55,144
I'll have, uh, beer. No, a coffee.

139
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,450
Coffee. And the lady?

140
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,456
I don't want a coffee.

141
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,960
You should have something strong.
It will pick you up.

142
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,496
I'll have a small glass
of Beaujolais.

143
00:15:05,564 --> 00:15:08,260
A small glass of Beaujolais and...

144
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,528
- a Martini.
- No coffee?

145
00:15:10,602 --> 00:15:12,536
No, no, a Martini.

146
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:20,203
I completely forgot!
I have a phone call to make.

147
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:24,538
I'll be right back.

148
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:43,690
- Waiter!
- All right, I'm coming.

149
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:48,736
I'll never understand suicide.

150
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:55,179
I have no argument against it,
but it's beyond my comprehension.

151
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,509
Did you ever discuss it with her?

152
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,449
Never.

153
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:04,953
I just can't believe it.

154
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,450
It's terrible. Terrible.

155
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,226
It's terrible, yeah.

156
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:14,697
Could it have been
a disappointment in love, perhaps?

157
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,599
- Something like that?
- Who with?

158
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:19,603
I don't know. Some man.

159
00:16:20,672 --> 00:16:22,606
You know she wasn't
interested in men.

160
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:27,472
Oh, yes, I know, but...

161
00:16:27,546 --> 00:16:31,243
Women as sensitive as she was...
as she is, I mean...

162
00:16:31,316 --> 00:16:33,250
often tend to have...

163
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:37,880
much more complicated relationships
than they seem to.

164
00:16:39,591 --> 00:16:42,458
Perhaps she will pull out
of it anyway.

165
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:45,257
I doubt it.

166
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,266
Did you notice that she didn't
even recognize me?

167
00:16:51,336 --> 00:16:53,065
A tragedy.

168
00:16:57,342 --> 00:17:00,175
Hey, man, you got any bread
for an artist?

169
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,417
I don't seem to have any change.

170
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,419
I don't care.
I'll take what you got.

171
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,250
There, you see?
I've only got notes.

172
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,790
Come on. You don't wanna look cheap
in front of your girlfriend.

173
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,328
Not a word of thanks.
Did you notice?

174
00:17:17,396 --> 00:17:19,330
I don't like tramps.

175
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:22,390
You shouldn't have
given him anything.

176
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,144
Would you like to have a drink?

177
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:06,806
No, thanks.

178
00:19:06,882 --> 00:19:09,009
Right.

179
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:10,813
- Good-bye, then.
- Good-bye.

180
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:13,013
Hope to see you soon.

181
00:19:31,473 --> 00:19:35,409
- What is it?
- Just came over from CNMA.

182
00:19:35,477 --> 00:19:38,878
- Was it sent by Monsieur Lott?
- Uh-huh, Monsieur Lott. Right.

183
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:40,915
That must be
the Villa LeDuc, then.

184
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:43,212
Yes, that's right.

185
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:47,415
Yeah, that's the Villa LeDuc.
"Unmounted, number 2601.

186
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:51,016
"Make detailed copy of spire
in the lower left-hand corner...

187
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:53,527
beside the registration number."

188
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:55,529
You have to do it by next Thursday.

189
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:33,901
I'm calling to ask you
if you have any news...

190
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:36,494
about Mademoiselle Simone Choule.

191
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:39,904
<i>- What department is she in?</i>
- Surgery.

192
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:42,910
<i>- Choule? With a C?</i>
- That's right.

193
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:45,913
- Simone Choule.
<i>- Are you a relative?</i>

194
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:49,212
No, I'm a friend.

195
00:20:49,284 --> 00:20:52,515
<i>The patient died</i>
<i>at 4:20 p: M: Yesterday:</i>

196
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:57,491
Thank you.

197
00:21:00,028 --> 00:21:01,461
Good-bye.

198
00:25:22,827 --> 00:25:24,954
- Morning, monsieur.
- Morning.

199
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,964
Live opposite?

200
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:29,159
Yes. I just moved in.

201
00:25:29,234 --> 00:25:33,671
You rented the apartment of that
girl that jumped out of the window?

202
00:25:33,738 --> 00:25:38,471
- Yes. Did you know her?
- Sure, I did. Came in every morning.

203
00:25:38,543 --> 00:25:43,310
Always sat in the same place.
Right there where you are now.

204
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:46,441
A cup of chocolate and a roll
and butter. Never drank coffee.

205
00:25:46,518 --> 00:25:51,455
Used to say, "If I have a coffee,
I can't sleep for two days."

206
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:54,686
- Question of what you're used to.
- Shall I make you a chocolate?

207
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:57,023
A question of temperament too,
I think.

208
00:25:57,095 --> 00:25:59,859
Still, a young girl
like that killing herself.

209
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:01,398
I can't imagine why.

210
00:26:01,466 --> 00:26:04,060
No reason at all, probably.

211
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:08,231
A moment of depression,
and wham, it's all over.

212
00:26:11,343 --> 00:26:12,275
Robert.

213
00:26:38,436 --> 00:26:40,028
Do you sell cigarettes?

214
00:26:40,105 --> 00:26:43,597
- Yes. What would you like?
- Gauloises Bleu, please.

215
00:26:43,675 --> 00:26:46,200
Oh. I'm right out of Gauloises.

216
00:26:46,277 --> 00:26:49,007
- Oh, what else do you have?
- Gitanes, Marlboro.

217
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,311
Mademoiselle Choule always smoked
Marlboro. Would you like a pack?

218
00:26:53,318 --> 00:26:55,115
No. No, thank you.

219
00:27:35,326 --> 00:27:39,990
Simone Choule, the Lord
has taken thee to his bosom...

220
00:27:40,065 --> 00:27:44,092
just as a shepherd brings in
his sheep at the close of day.

221
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:48,071
What could be more natural,
of greater consolation?

222
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:50,573
Is it not the fondest hope
and desire of all of us...

223
00:27:50,642 --> 00:27:54,408
that we shall one day
rejoin the flock of holy ones?

224
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:57,937
Hope of eternal life?
The true life?

225
00:27:58,016 --> 00:28:01,417
Shorn of all worldly cares?

226
00:28:01,486 --> 00:28:05,616
Face to face in eternal
blessedness with Almighty God...

227
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,885
who through his son
our Lord Jesus Christ...

228
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:12,362
died for us on the cross.

229
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,661
Who deigns to look down upon us
poor mortal creatures...

230
00:28:15,734 --> 00:28:18,168
full of love,
infinitely merciful...

231
00:28:18,236 --> 00:28:22,673
the sick, the suffering, the dying.

232
00:28:22,741 --> 00:28:26,734
Yes, the dying. The icy tomb.

233
00:28:26,811 --> 00:28:31,339
Thou shalt return to the dust
from whence thou came...

234
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:33,577
and only thy bones remain.

235
00:28:33,651 --> 00:28:35,778
The worms shall consume thy eyes...

236
00:28:35,854 --> 00:28:39,290
thy lips, thy mouth.

237
00:28:39,357 --> 00:28:43,851
They shall enter into thy ears.
They shall enter into thy nostrils.

238
00:28:43,928 --> 00:28:47,329
Thy body shall putrefy
unto its innermost recesses...

239
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:50,367
and shall give off
a noisome stench.

240
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:53,563
Yea, Christ is ascended
into heaven and hath joined...

241
00:28:53,638 --> 00:28:57,699
the host of angels on high,
but not for creeps like you...

242
00:28:57,776 --> 00:28:59,971
full of the basest vice...

243
00:29:00,044 --> 00:29:04,174
yearning only for
carnal satisfaction.

244
00:29:04,249 --> 00:29:09,152
How dare you pester me,
and mock at me to my very face.

245
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,188
What audacity!

246
00:29:11,256 --> 00:29:14,225
What are you doing here
in my temple?

247
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:16,658
The graveyard
is where you belong.

248
00:29:16,728 --> 00:29:18,719
Thou shalt stink.

249
00:29:18,797 --> 00:29:22,733
Thou shalt stink like some putrefied
corpse lying along the wayside.

250
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:25,201
Verily I say unto thee...

251
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:29,297
thou shalt never enter
into my kingdom.

252
00:29:35,914 --> 00:29:40,317
Four, three, two, one, zero!

253
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:44,048
There he is. Hey, Trelkovsky.
The lucky lodger, huh?

254
00:29:44,122 --> 00:29:46,056
Oh, Lucille Pampin, from Nice.

255
00:29:46,124 --> 00:29:48,092
- On the Riviera.
- She's 5'4" and 140 pounds.

256
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,218
Best blow job in Paris!

257
00:29:50,295 --> 00:29:52,229
- Pleased to meet you.
- How do you do.

258
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:54,231
Don't anybody get up.
What is this?

259
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:57,097
No more chairs than that?
What a dump!

260
00:29:57,168 --> 00:29:59,728
There is a table right here.

261
00:29:59,804 --> 00:30:02,364
Your fiance can come
and sit on my knees, okay? Come on.

262
00:30:03,608 --> 00:30:06,042
It's against my principles.
Hey, come on. Give me a hand.

263
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,237
- Hi, how are you?
- Wait a second.

264
00:30:08,313 --> 00:30:10,645
- Grab that end, will you?
- Ah, that's more like it.

265
00:30:10,715 --> 00:30:12,649
Careful, huh?

266
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:17,144
- Put it right in the middle there.
- That's it.

267
00:30:17,222 --> 00:30:20,350
- What about chairs though?
- Listen, maybe there's a bed here.

268
00:30:20,425 --> 00:30:22,893
- Yeah, why not?
- Move that table over.

269
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:25,452
- Okay.
- Take the table outta there first.

270
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:29,466
- Want me to do anything?
- Oh, thank you. You're very kind.

271
00:30:29,534 --> 00:30:33,664
- Here, let me finish that.
- We'll just get this salad finished.

272
00:30:33,738 --> 00:30:35,933
- Have you met Viviane?
- Hello.

273
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:37,440
Hi.

274
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:41,578
- Set her down.
- There, that's okay.

275
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:44,774
- Easy does it.
- Oh. What the hell is this?

276
00:30:50,121 --> 00:30:51,418
Is that one of yours?

277
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,051
No, no, cut it out.
He's got a heart of gold.

278
00:31:04,168 --> 00:31:06,363
That's right,
he's got the heart of a chick.

279
00:31:06,437 --> 00:31:08,769
Sure, you would. You'd be happy
to do it for a little bread.

280
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,774
No, I wouldn't.
I'm not interested.

281
00:31:10,842 --> 00:31:13,367
You could offer me a fortune
and I still wouldn't dream of it.

282
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:15,605
Who you trying to kid?

283
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,080
You think there's anyone dumb
enough to offer you a fortune?

284
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:20,777
- She's talking about the principle.
- The principle?

285
00:31:20,852 --> 00:31:22,786
- That's right.
- You know what I think of them?

286
00:31:22,854 --> 00:31:25,721
- You wanna know what I think?
- Well, come on. What do you think?

287
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,985
It's a lot of crap.
That's what your principles are.

288
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:30,357
I tell you,
I'd do it for nothing.

289
00:31:30,428 --> 00:31:32,362
- You would?
- You bet. Absolutely nothin'.

290
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,364
It takes all kinds.

291
00:31:34,432 --> 00:31:36,832
Nobody wants me to,
but I'd pay them to let me.

292
00:31:36,901 --> 00:31:38,368
I'd write a check,
but I wouldn't pay.

293
00:31:38,436 --> 00:31:42,202
I saw one once... blech!
Makes you wanna throw up.

294
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:44,207
Would anybody mind
if the subject were changed?

295
00:31:44,275 --> 00:31:47,540
What do you want to talk about...
women's lib, social security?

296
00:31:47,612 --> 00:31:49,546
Oh, keep women's lib out of it,
for Christ's sake.

297
00:31:49,614 --> 00:31:52,139
Oh, yeah? Have you looked at 'em?
Have you looked at those militants?

298
00:31:52,216 --> 00:31:54,343
It's enough to turn you queer.

299
00:31:56,921 --> 00:31:59,272
Oh, look what that pig's doing now.
He's actually pissing in the sink.

300
00:31:59,272 --> 00:32:00,762
Oh, look what that pig's doing now.
He's actually pissing in the sink.

301
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:03,867
- How revolting!
- Come on, get off my back, will ya?

302
00:32:03,944 --> 00:32:06,936
It's not my fault if there's
no john in this crummy apartment.

303
00:32:34,207 --> 00:32:37,836
You're making a great deal
of noise, monsieur.

304
00:32:37,911 --> 00:32:42,439
It's after 1:00, and you're
making a great deal of noise.

305
00:32:42,516 --> 00:32:45,212
I'm just having a few friends
over for a quiet chat.

306
00:32:45,285 --> 00:32:49,187
Quiet? I live upstairs, and I
can hear every word you're saying.

307
00:32:50,223 --> 00:32:54,922
You've been dragging furniture
around, stamping about the place.

308
00:32:54,995 --> 00:32:59,125
It's intolerable. Do you intend
to carry on like this much longer?

309
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:02,134
Who is that asshole? Hmm?

310
00:33:06,206 --> 00:33:08,140
Look.

311
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:14,540
I'm terribly sorry I woke you.
I will be more careful from now on.

312
00:33:14,614 --> 00:33:19,051
You don't seem to give a damn
about anyone else.

313
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:21,485
It's all very well
to have a good time.

314
00:33:21,555 --> 00:33:24,922
But some people have to work,
you know?

315
00:33:24,991 --> 00:33:29,155
Tomorrow's Sunday. It's reasonable
for me to have a few people...

316
00:33:29,229 --> 00:33:30,958
around on Saturday evening.

317
00:33:31,031 --> 00:33:34,091
No, monsieur.
It's not reasonable...

318
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:37,933
to make such a racket,
even on a Saturday evening!

319
00:33:41,975 --> 00:33:44,671
We will be more careful.
Good night, monsieur.

320
00:33:54,754 --> 00:33:57,052
Sure. Soon you won't even
be able to jerk off...

321
00:33:57,124 --> 00:33:59,854
without him knocking
on the door.

322
00:34:00,627 --> 00:34:02,857
You shouldn't let him
push you around that way.

323
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:05,989
- I know. You should counterattack.
- Oh, you know what?

324
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:08,660
- We gotta take revenge.
- Why don't we set the john on fire?

325
00:34:08,735 --> 00:34:11,135
- Throw scorpions down his chimney.
- Or crabs.

326
00:34:11,204 --> 00:34:13,138
Crabs won't work. Scorpions.

327
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:15,538
No. We'll drill a hole
in the wall and force gas in.

328
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:18,169
- Yeah!
- Or make a hole in the floor.

329
00:34:18,245 --> 00:34:20,179
Don't be so silly.

330
00:34:20,247 --> 00:34:22,875
That's because he only
thinks below the belt.

331
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:25,679
What's this? I'll be damned,
he's throwing us out of the house.

332
00:34:25,752 --> 00:34:29,347
- Look, it's late.
- Aw, come on.

333
00:34:29,422 --> 00:34:31,947
Okay, gang.
Let's go find someplace else.

334
00:34:32,025 --> 00:34:35,722
- Give me my coat.
- Pass me my coat, huh?

335
00:34:35,795 --> 00:34:38,320
Be careful.
Be careful with those coats.

336
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:40,491
- Come on. On your feet.
- My shoes.

337
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:43,502
Let's go, everybody.

338
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,060
Wait. We going or what?

339
00:34:45,138 --> 00:34:48,073
- Sure, buddy.
- Bye, everybody.

340
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:51,508
- Come on, everyone.
- Night!

341
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:53,944
Let's go. Everybody out!

342
00:34:54,014 --> 00:34:55,777
One hell of a party.

343
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:59,216
- Good night, my friends!
- Hey!

344
00:35:04,891 --> 00:35:07,587
Shh! Don't make so much noise!
People are sleeping!

345
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:34,299
Morning, Monsieur Zy.
Lovely day, isn't it?

346
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:38,407
I'm terribly embarrassed
about last night...

347
00:37:38,478 --> 00:37:41,675
and I can promise you
it will never happen again.

348
00:37:41,748 --> 00:37:44,740
I should hope not.
You woke up both me and my wife.

349
00:37:44,818 --> 00:37:47,548
Couldn't get back to sleep.
What was the meaning of all that?

350
00:37:49,689 --> 00:37:54,592
I thought I'd have a few friends
over to celebrate my good fortune...

351
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:58,392
having found this lovely apartment.

352
00:37:58,465 --> 00:38:03,425
A sort of a house warming,
without disturbing anyone.

353
00:38:03,503 --> 00:38:07,405
And then, you know how it is
with the best will in the world...

354
00:38:07,474 --> 00:38:11,877
and not dreaming
of disturbing anyone...

355
00:38:11,945 --> 00:38:14,413
you talk,
you're having a good time.

356
00:38:14,481 --> 00:38:18,850
And before you even know it,
you're making so much noise that...

357
00:38:18,918 --> 00:38:23,355
Look, I'm sorry. I can promise you
it'll never happen again.

358
00:38:24,457 --> 00:38:27,756
Well, I'm very glad to hear that,
Monsieur Trelkovsky.

359
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:31,422
Because I was seriously
thinking of taking steps.

360
00:38:31,498 --> 00:38:34,626
Apartments are hard enough
to come by these days.

361
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:37,693
So it's worth keeping the one
you have, don't you think?

362
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,754
"Outraged neighbor shoots
tipsy tenor...

363
00:40:17,822 --> 00:40:20,256
for singing
<i>La Tosca</i> at 3:00 a.m.

364
00:40:20,325 --> 00:40:23,726
Louis Marais, age 39, a bachelor
and traveling salesman...

365
00:40:23,795 --> 00:40:26,423
came home at 3:00 in the
morning after one drink too many...

366
00:40:26,497 --> 00:40:29,432
and proceeded to sing opera
with his windows wide open.

367
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,730
When a neighbor, Monsieur Pierrot,
expressed a wish...

368
00:40:31,803 --> 00:40:35,239
that he put off his warbling
until somewhat later...

369
00:40:35,306 --> 00:40:38,605
Monsieur Marais illustrated his
contempt for such a suggestion...

370
00:40:38,676 --> 00:40:40,803
with an air from <i>Tosca</i>
delivered on the hall landing.

371
00:40:40,878 --> 00:40:43,938
Pierrot reappeared with a gun and
emptied it into the poor tenor...

372
00:40:44,015 --> 00:40:46,779
who died before the ambulance
reached the hospital.

373
00:40:46,851 --> 00:40:50,218
The murderer is under arrest."

374
00:40:54,892 --> 00:40:57,690
You there! Quiet down!

375
00:40:57,762 --> 00:41:01,323
How much longer are you gonna
keep up this racket?

376
00:44:32,176 --> 00:44:35,373
- Who is it?
- It's me.

377
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:47,814
What can I do for you?

378
00:44:47,892 --> 00:44:50,725
Monsieur, was it you who
registered a complaint?

379
00:44:51,696 --> 00:44:53,459
A complaint?

380
00:44:53,531 --> 00:44:55,465
Against whom?

381
00:44:55,533 --> 00:44:58,263
Against me,
for causing a disturbance at night.

382
00:44:58,336 --> 00:45:00,896
I never made any complaint.

383
00:45:00,972 --> 00:45:05,875
Someone has registered a complaint.
It came this morning.

384
00:45:05,943 --> 00:45:09,310
She's the one who makes
all the noise all night long.

385
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:13,817
- Who?
- That old woman. She's evil.

386
00:45:13,885 --> 00:45:17,343
She's done everything she could
to make things difficult for us.

387
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:20,322
Just because the girl is disabled.

388
00:45:22,994 --> 00:45:25,986
- You didn't register a complaint?
- Of course not.

389
00:45:26,063 --> 00:45:28,896
Then it must have been her.

390
00:45:28,966 --> 00:45:32,299
I asked downstairs.
They said it might have been you.

391
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,931
Monsieur, we go to bed early.
Not like her.

392
00:45:36,007 --> 00:45:41,912
She can't sleep at night, so she
walks up and down her apartment...

393
00:45:41,979 --> 00:45:44,504
moves the furniture around.

394
00:45:44,582 --> 00:45:47,608
She keeps me
and my daughter awake.

395
00:45:47,685 --> 00:45:53,453
Do you know what she did, monsieur?
Jammed a broom up against my door.

396
00:45:53,524 --> 00:45:56,391
I had to heave it open
with all my strength...

397
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,954
and I twisted a muscle
in my shoulder...

398
00:46:01,032 --> 00:46:03,091
and now she wants
to have us thrown out.

399
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:06,000
- She can't have you thrown out.
- Can't she?

400
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:10,166
- Of course not.
- I never make any noise, honestly.

401
00:46:10,241 --> 00:46:13,074
Even if you did, they can't
throw you out like that.

402
00:46:14,211 --> 00:46:17,237
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

403
00:46:22,253 --> 00:46:27,975
God bless you. God bless you,
monsieur. Thank you.

404
00:46:38,653 --> 00:46:42,350
- What about your neighbors?
- Getting used to them.

405
00:46:42,423 --> 00:46:45,859
I have no problem, you know.
They have to get used to me too.

406
00:46:50,598 --> 00:46:53,226
If they keep bugging you,
Simon and I know a few ways...

407
00:46:53,301 --> 00:46:55,235
of dealing with them,
eh, Simon?

408
00:46:55,303 --> 00:46:57,237
Sure, we know some great tricks.

409
00:46:57,305 --> 00:46:58,636
Like, we could come around
in the middle of the night...

410
00:46:58,706 --> 00:47:02,301
and yell up at you from the
courtyard... you see what I mean?

411
00:47:02,376 --> 00:47:05,607
Hey, Trelkovsky! Come out for
a drink! Come on now, get movin'!

412
00:47:06,514 --> 00:47:08,914
Or we can knock on the floor below,
after midnight, of course.

413
00:47:08,983 --> 00:47:11,383
That's right.
Knock on the door, shouting:

414
00:47:11,452 --> 00:47:15,320
"On your feet, shitface. We're off
to the park for a blow job!"

415
00:47:17,058 --> 00:47:18,491
You know...

416
00:47:22,964 --> 00:47:25,125
There is something odd
going on in my building.

417
00:47:27,935 --> 00:47:30,733
I quite often see people
in the toilets...

418
00:47:30,805 --> 00:47:33,899
- across the courtyard.
- What are you, a peeping Tom?

419
00:47:33,975 --> 00:47:37,706
Do you mean people together
in the shithouse? Like an orgy?

420
00:47:37,779 --> 00:47:43,046
No, no. They just stand there
for hours, you know?

421
00:47:43,117 --> 00:47:45,847
Absolutely dead still.

422
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,387
They're obviously
playing with themselves.

423
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,888
Not at all.

424
00:47:48,956 --> 00:47:51,789
He just told you.
They stand dead still.

425
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:54,692
Can you play with yourself
without moving?

426
00:48:04,272 --> 00:48:06,604
- What would you like to drink?
- What are you having?

427
00:48:06,674 --> 00:48:09,040
- Beer.
- Beer's fine.

428
00:48:37,471 --> 00:48:42,033
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Just...

429
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:44,168
Don't worry,
I know what I'm doing.

430
00:48:48,549 --> 00:48:51,541
- Turn it down a little.
- Leave it alone.

431
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:54,019
They're used to it by now.

432
00:48:54,088 --> 00:48:56,522
But it's too loud,
even for us.

433
00:48:56,591 --> 00:49:00,288
Try and get used to it.
Try to enjoy it while you can.

434
00:49:00,361 --> 00:49:02,886
You can't do it at home.

435
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:16,742
Neighbor.

436
00:49:17,945 --> 00:49:19,378
I hope so.

437
00:49:31,492 --> 00:49:35,588
I hate to bother you, monsieur.
I see you have company.

438
00:49:35,663 --> 00:49:40,464
But I wonder, could you turn down
the sound a little? My wife's sick.

439
00:49:40,534 --> 00:49:43,833
So she's sick, is she? Well,
what am I supposed to do about it?

440
00:49:43,905 --> 00:49:46,806
Stop living because of her?

441
00:49:46,874 --> 00:49:50,139
If she's sick,
why doesn't she go to a hospital?

442
00:49:50,211 --> 00:49:54,978
I'll play my records when I want
and as loud as I want.

443
00:49:55,049 --> 00:49:57,176
You know, I'm a bit
hard of hearing myself...

444
00:49:57,251 --> 00:49:59,617
but that's no reason to be
deprived of my music.

445
00:50:03,324 --> 00:50:05,383
And don't try anything funny.

446
00:50:05,459 --> 00:50:08,326
I know the superintendent
of police.

447
00:50:14,135 --> 00:50:17,832
See? That's how
you deal with 'em.

448
00:50:17,905 --> 00:50:20,396
- What if his wife really is...
- So what? I don't go...

449
00:50:20,474 --> 00:50:23,966
moaning to him every time
I don't feel well.

450
00:50:24,045 --> 00:50:27,913
He won't come back either.
I can promise you that.

451
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:48,635
Just a moment, please.

452
00:52:48,689 --> 00:52:51,317
Who is it?

453
00:52:51,392 --> 00:52:54,088
Isn't this Simone Choule's
apartment?

454
00:52:59,934 --> 00:53:04,871
Yes, it used to be.
I'm the new tenant.

455
00:53:04,939 --> 00:53:06,873
Has she moved then?

456
00:53:08,809 --> 00:53:10,743
Come in, please.
Don't stand there like that.

457
00:53:15,649 --> 00:53:17,583
Nothing's happened to her,
I hope.

458
00:53:20,321 --> 00:53:22,651
Please sit down, Monsieur...

459
00:53:23,886 --> 00:53:26,480
- Badar.
- Pleased to meet you, monsieur.

460
00:53:26,555 --> 00:53:28,489
My name is Trelkovsky.

461
00:53:31,594 --> 00:53:35,086
I'm afraid there has been
an unfortunate, uh...

462
00:53:37,566 --> 00:53:39,500
Did you know her well?

463
00:53:41,837 --> 00:53:44,101
Did I know her?

464
00:53:44,173 --> 00:53:46,107
She committed suicide.

465
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:50,779
Threw herself out of the window.

466
00:53:50,846 --> 00:53:55,180
- If you'd like to see...
- But...

467
00:53:55,251 --> 00:53:59,347
But why?
Why would she do a thing like that?

468
00:53:59,422 --> 00:54:01,754
No one seems to know.

469
00:54:01,824 --> 00:54:05,089
- Do you know Stella?
- No.

470
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:08,130
She doesn't know either.

471
00:54:08,197 --> 00:54:10,791
No one knows why she did it.

472
00:54:25,915 --> 00:54:30,352
I went to the Egyptian department
at the Louvre this morning.

473
00:54:33,756 --> 00:54:37,089
I found a nice postcard,
and I sent it to her.

474
00:54:38,594 --> 00:54:40,994
What irony.

475
00:54:41,063 --> 00:54:44,794
Years of affection without
ever daring to say anything.

476
00:54:44,867 --> 00:54:48,769
I acted as though we were
just friends each time I saw her...

477
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:52,171
which wasn't very often,
I can tell you that.

478
00:54:53,909 --> 00:54:56,400
It just isn't fair.

479
00:54:56,479 --> 00:55:00,506
The day I summon up enough
courage to tell her...

480
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:02,881
I find out...

481
00:55:02,952 --> 00:55:05,512
I find out she's...

482
00:55:11,427 --> 00:55:13,952
Why?

483
00:55:14,029 --> 00:55:17,021
Why didn't I ever tell her?

484
00:55:18,234 --> 00:55:21,897
She's gone without ever knowing it.

485
00:55:21,971 --> 00:55:24,439
We'll be closing now,
Monsieur Trelkovsky.

486
00:55:24,507 --> 00:55:27,271
- Yeah.
- Life isn't worth living anymore.

487
00:55:27,343 --> 00:55:29,607
- You mustn't...
- That'll be six francs sixty.

488
00:55:29,678 --> 00:55:33,114
You mustn't think like that.
You're young. You'll forget.

489
00:55:35,284 --> 00:55:36,717
Wait.

490
00:55:38,721 --> 00:55:40,689
Wait a minute!

491
00:55:42,157 --> 00:55:44,091
Thank you.

492
00:55:53,705 --> 00:55:55,900
I can promise you
she didn't suffer.

493
00:55:56,975 --> 00:55:59,967
And she didn't say anything?

494
00:56:00,044 --> 00:56:02,638
- You sure?
- Absolutely certain.

495
00:56:04,315 --> 00:56:06,249
All right, all right.

496
00:56:08,153 --> 00:56:10,747
It's my round,
for Christ's sakes.

497
00:56:10,822 --> 00:56:12,585
Drinks for everyone!

498
00:56:21,566 --> 00:56:23,397
Everyone except him.

499
00:56:37,482 --> 00:56:42,283
Don't mind him.
He's drunk. Drunk.

500
00:56:42,353 --> 00:56:46,619
- What you've done for me...
- It's natural.

501
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:51,151
- It's not natural at all.
- It is natural.

502
00:56:51,229 --> 00:56:56,292
There aren't many guys around
like you. It's as simple as this.

503
00:56:59,404 --> 00:57:01,338
You saved my life.

504
00:57:24,896 --> 00:57:26,625
- Morning.
- Good morning.

505
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:32,664
A cup of chocolate,
Monsieur Trelkovsky?

506
00:57:32,737 --> 00:57:34,329
Why not?

507
00:57:44,282 --> 00:57:46,216
Could I have some
Gauloises Bleu, please?

508
00:57:46,284 --> 00:57:47,876
Yes.

509
00:57:59,063 --> 00:58:02,692
Mmm. I wanted some Gauloises.

510
00:58:02,767 --> 00:58:05,964
- Gauloises Bleu.
- I thought you said Marlboro.

511
00:58:06,037 --> 00:58:11,168
I've run out of Gauloises.
I'll send Robert out for some.

512
00:58:11,242 --> 00:58:14,268
Don't bother.
I'll take the Marlboro.

513
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:34,994
Yes, I know!

514
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:38,502
I know I'm making a noise!

515
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:43,311
You should have knocked before
when the thieves were here!

516
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:51,578
Perhaps they did knock before.

517
01:00:01,597 --> 01:00:04,293
This can't go on any longer,
Monsieur Trelkovsky.

518
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:08,827
You kept everyone awake again.
All the neighbors are complaining.

519
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:11,430
I beg your pardon, Monsieur Zy.
Are you talking about last night?

520
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:15,307
Of course I'm talking about last
night. You made a fiendish racket.

521
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:19,906
You won't be here much longer
if you continue on like that.

522
01:00:19,982 --> 01:00:22,678
I'm afraid I shall
be forced to take steps.

523
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:26,950
I've been robbed, Monsieur Zy.
I'm on my way to the police station.

524
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:32,521
What do you mean?
My house is a respectable place.

525
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:35,860
- If you're making up nonsense...
- It's true!

526
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:41,427
My television's gone,
my camera, one of my suitcases.

527
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:48,107
Oh, I see. Well,
I'm very sorry for you...

528
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:50,441
but why are you going to the police?

529
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:55,816
To tell them what happened.

530
01:00:55,885 --> 01:01:00,117
Now, look, Monsieur Trelkovsky,
this is an honest house.

531
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:02,749
- My tenants are honest people.
- There's no question of it...

532
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:07,387
Let me finish. You know how careful
I am in choosing my tenants.

533
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:11,058
I let you have the apartment because
I thought you were an honest man.

534
01:01:11,133 --> 01:01:14,625
Otherwise I wouldn't have
taken a million francs.

535
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:20,609
If you go to the police, they'll be
here asking all sorts of questions...

536
01:01:20,676 --> 01:01:22,769
useless questions, of course...

537
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:27,214
but all that can have a disastrous
effect on our reputation here.

538
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:29,751
I'm saying this
for your sake too.

539
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:32,083
For my sake?
But what have I done?

540
01:01:32,154 --> 01:01:37,353
Once you involve the police,
you're looked on with suspicion.

541
01:01:37,426 --> 01:01:40,657
Especially if you're not French.

542
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,062
But I'm a French citizen.

543
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:46,590
I know you've done nothing wrong,
but other people won't know that.

544
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:48,864
They'll suspect you
of God knows what.

545
01:01:49,705 --> 01:01:52,469
Oh, believe me,
I know what I'm talking about.

546
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:55,738
I know the superintendent
of police here.

547
01:01:55,811 --> 01:01:59,474
I'll have a word with him about
all this. He'll know what to do.

548
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:04,347
Oh, by the way...

549
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:09,153
the former tenant always
wore slippers after 10:00.

550
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,887
It was much more comfortable
for her...

551
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:17,628
and for the neighbors.

552
01:02:20,569 --> 01:02:23,163
- A pack of Marlboros.
- Gimme a pack of Gauloises.

553
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,167
A pack of Marlboros, please.

554
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:37,786
- Pack of Gauloises.
- Eight franc sixty.

555
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,756
Okay, see ya next week.

556
01:03:11,787 --> 01:03:14,187
Hello! How are you?

557
01:03:14,256 --> 01:03:17,487
Very well, thanks. I was just going
to buy some cigarettes.

558
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,427
Come and join us.
These are some friends of mine.

559
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:23,363
- May I?
- Of course.

560
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,900
- Hi.
- Hi.

561
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:31,973
We were just
talking about Simone.

562
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,271
- Simone?
- Simone Choule.

563
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:40,042
This is the guy I told you about...
the one I met at the hospital.

564
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:44,576
- We were the last to see her alive.
- Stella told us...

565
01:03:44,653 --> 01:03:47,383
Simone didn't seem
to know her.

566
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:49,720
- I don't think she did.
- And you?

567
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:53,990
- Me?
- She didn't recognize you either?

568
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:57,589
It's hard to say.

569
01:03:57,666 --> 01:04:01,102
I couldn't be sure
one way or the other.

570
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:04,936
Perhaps she was trying to say
something when she screamed.

571
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:11,339
Anyway, that's the impression
I get when I think back on it.

572
01:04:12,948 --> 01:04:16,111
She was looking at you
when she let out that cry.

573
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:20,681
- You think so?
- You know...

574
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:25,489
I still have some things of hers
at home. It's depressing.

575
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:29,827
- What've you got of hers?
- Some books, a couple of records.

576
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,338
There's one of Simone's books.

577
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:49,782
- I haven't read it.
- Nor have I.

578
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:52,548
I'm not interested
in Egyptology.

579
01:04:52,621 --> 01:04:57,024
She left it behind one evening.
You can have it if you like.

580
01:04:57,092 --> 01:05:00,391
Oh, you're very kind.
I would love to read it.

581
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:07,661
It's a magnificent place
you've got here.

582
01:05:07,736 --> 01:05:10,170
Better than where I live,
I can tell you.

583
01:05:14,109 --> 01:05:18,170
Sorry, if you don't mind me
asking, is the rent very high?

584
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:22,081
I don't pay for it.
It belongs to my brother.

585
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:28,021
He's gone off to Peru
for a few months, a year, traveling.

586
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,682
Look, this track.

587
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:37,222
Do you have any trouble
with your neighbors?

588
01:05:37,299 --> 01:05:38,732
What sort of trouble?

589
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:41,201
Well, you know...

590
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:44,933
these days, relationships
with neighbors can get...

591
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:47,271
quite complicated.

592
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:53,907
You know, little things that get
blown up out of all proportion.

593
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:55,610
You know what I mean?

594
01:05:55,684 --> 01:05:58,778
No. No, I don't.

595
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,756
I mind my own business.

596
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:08,394
So do I.
It's the best way.

597
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,532
If you like,
I'll take you home.

598
01:06:32,797 --> 01:06:36,130
Shall we go back
to your place?

599
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:38,465
My place?

600
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,475
Okay?

601
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,477
Sure. Fine.

602
01:06:49,781 --> 01:06:53,717
Only my place is a bit...

603
01:06:53,785 --> 01:06:56,379
Well, it's a bit difficult.

604
01:06:56,454 --> 01:07:00,481
- In fact, it's impossible.
- Why?

605
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:03,721
- Have you got a girlfriend?
- No.

606
01:07:03,795 --> 01:07:06,025
Not exactly.

607
01:07:06,097 --> 01:07:11,296
It's just that I've been repainting,
and the place is in chaos.

608
01:07:13,037 --> 01:07:17,030
We could still spend
a couple of hours there, hmm?

609
01:07:17,108 --> 01:07:21,704
On top of that, my uncle is
just up from the country...

610
01:07:21,779 --> 01:07:24,077
staying a few days.

611
01:07:28,219 --> 01:07:30,483
How about your place?

612
01:07:39,163 --> 01:07:41,427
Take off your coat.

613
01:07:53,578 --> 01:07:55,978
I'll be right back.

614
01:08:19,837 --> 01:08:21,702
I'd love something to drink.

615
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,170
Cheers.

616
01:08:31,683 --> 01:08:33,150
Cheers.

617
01:08:42,126 --> 01:08:44,356
Why don't you
take your tie off?

618
01:08:44,429 --> 01:08:47,159
You look like you're
choking to death.

619
01:08:49,467 --> 01:08:52,527
I found a tooth
in my apartment.

620
01:08:52,603 --> 01:08:55,470
- It was in a hole.
- A tooth?

621
01:08:57,075 --> 01:08:59,009
In a hole?

622
01:08:59,077 --> 01:09:03,104
Yeah.
A hole in the wall.

623
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:05,809
Wrapped in cotton wool.

624
01:09:05,883 --> 01:09:10,616
So? No need to pull
such a long face over a tooth.

625
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,790
Pretty weird, though, isn't it?

626
01:09:16,127 --> 01:09:18,493
Not really.

627
01:09:18,563 --> 01:09:21,828
When I was young,
we did it all the time.

628
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:24,834
Whenever one of my teeth
fell out...

629
01:09:24,902 --> 01:09:27,598
I used to hide it.

630
01:09:27,672 --> 01:09:31,540
My mother said it would
turn into a coin.

631
01:09:31,609 --> 01:09:33,372
A coin.

632
01:09:39,951 --> 01:09:42,146
Oh, God.

633
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:45,087
- Stella, I was wondering...
- Yeah?

634
01:09:45,156 --> 01:09:46,589
Tooth...

635
01:09:49,293 --> 01:09:51,955
Tooth is a part of ourselves,
isn't it?

636
01:09:52,029 --> 01:09:56,625
Like a bit of our personality.

637
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,663
I don't know what you mean.

638
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:08,072
I remember, in the newspaper...

639
01:10:08,146 --> 01:10:13,607
a man lost his arm in an accident
and wanted to have it buried.

640
01:10:13,684 --> 01:10:16,175
He wanted to do what?

641
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:19,621
Have it buried in a cemetery.

642
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:22,955
- He must have been nuts.
- The authorities refused.

643
01:10:24,061 --> 01:10:27,360
The arm was cremated,
and that was that.

644
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:29,900
Where did this happen...
in France?

645
01:10:31,135 --> 01:10:36,072
I wonder if they refused
to give him the ashes.

646
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:39,803
And if so, by what right?

647
01:10:39,877 --> 01:10:42,345
Haven't you got anything
more cheerful to talk about?

648
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,557
All right. That'll do.

649
01:10:58,996 --> 01:11:00,293
Don't worry.

650
01:11:11,742 --> 01:11:13,972
Tell me...

651
01:11:14,045 --> 01:11:18,448
At what precise moment...

652
01:11:18,516 --> 01:11:23,112
does an individual stop being
who he thinks he is?

653
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:28,088
You know,
I don't like complications.

654
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,389
You cut off my arm, right?

655
01:11:30,461 --> 01:11:34,693
I say me and my arm.

656
01:11:34,765 --> 01:11:37,097
You cut off my other arm.

657
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:40,433
I say me and my two arms.

658
01:11:45,142 --> 01:11:49,306
Take out my stomach, my kidneys...

659
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:51,848
assuming that were possible.

660
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:56,517
And I say
me and my intestines.

661
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:00,982
Follow me?

662
01:12:04,996 --> 01:12:08,830
And now,
if you cut off my head...

663
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:11,460
would I say...

664
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:15,905
me and my head,
or me and my body?

665
01:12:18,342 --> 01:12:22,938
What right has my head
to call itself "me"?

666
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:27,976
What right?

667
01:13:37,221 --> 01:13:38,503
Oh, God.

668
01:14:05,097 --> 01:14:06,724
Monsieur Trelkovsky?

669
01:14:12,137 --> 01:14:14,765
Stay! Stay, Mirza, stay.

670
01:14:16,975 --> 01:14:19,842
You were out all night, huh?

671
01:14:19,911 --> 01:14:24,245
Yes, I had to stay with my uncle.

672
01:14:24,316 --> 01:14:26,250
He isn't well.

673
01:14:27,352 --> 01:14:30,287
I'll tell Madame Dioz
you're back.

674
01:14:30,355 --> 01:14:32,585
Madame Dioz?

675
01:14:32,658 --> 01:14:34,489
Who's Madame Dioz?

676
01:14:35,727 --> 01:14:39,493
This isn't for me. Look!

677
01:14:54,813 --> 01:14:59,216
"Best wishes from the Louvre.
Georges Badar."

678
01:16:14,593 --> 01:16:17,721
I should like to have
a word with you, monsieur.

679
01:16:17,796 --> 01:16:19,855
Please, come in, madame.

680
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,268
I am Madame Dioz.

681
01:16:27,239 --> 01:16:28,672
Pleased to meet you.

682
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:33,040
This is why I've come to see you.
Please read it.

683
01:16:33,111 --> 01:16:37,639
It is a petition against
the unspeakable Madame Gaderian.

684
01:16:37,716 --> 01:16:42,813
She's gone too far this time.
We've got to do something about it.

685
01:16:42,888 --> 01:16:47,655
Look. Even Monsieur Zy
has signed. There.

686
01:16:47,726 --> 01:16:51,218
Who is this Madame Gaderian?
I don't know her.

687
01:16:51,296 --> 01:16:55,426
You mean, you don't know her? Who
do you think makes all that noise?

688
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,401
It is her, my dear young man.
It is her.

689
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:03,100
Do you know she does her washing up
in the middle of the night?

690
01:17:03,175 --> 01:17:06,076
And she whistles
at the same time.

691
01:17:06,144 --> 01:17:09,636
Now, does a civilized person
behave like that?

692
01:17:09,714 --> 01:17:11,614
No, I suppose not.

693
01:17:11,683 --> 01:17:15,619
Well, go on then, sign. It's simply
a question of solidarity.

694
01:17:15,687 --> 01:17:21,353
She's making life impossible for...
for the other tenants.

695
01:17:21,426 --> 01:17:24,623
Is she the one who lives
with a disabled daughter?

696
01:17:25,864 --> 01:17:28,264
Disabled? No.

697
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:31,666
She has a boy...
a horrible, noisy brat...

698
01:17:31,736 --> 01:17:36,571
who's always playing skittles
or God knows what in the corridor.

699
01:17:36,641 --> 01:17:41,578
Are you sure? Are you certain
she doesn't have a young daughter?

700
01:17:42,681 --> 01:17:47,050
I don't know
what goes on in their lair.

701
01:17:47,118 --> 01:17:49,450
Ask the concierge.

702
01:17:53,325 --> 01:17:56,419
I'm sorry.
I'm not signing any petition.

703
01:17:58,063 --> 01:18:00,395
This woman has
never bothered me.

704
01:18:00,465 --> 01:18:03,298
I've never seen her
or even heard of her.

705
01:18:04,636 --> 01:18:08,037
What apartment does
she live in anyway?

706
01:18:08,106 --> 01:18:11,303
I shall make a note
of your attitude.

707
01:18:11,376 --> 01:18:14,004
I can see what we're
dealing with here.

708
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:16,843
Everyone for himself,
and never mind anyone else, hmm?

709
01:18:16,915 --> 01:18:18,542
Not at all. L...

710
01:18:18,617 --> 01:18:22,314
I know your type exactly,
like that man opposite...

711
01:18:22,387 --> 01:18:25,515
right up until the day he was
struck down with paralysis.

712
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:29,458
Then his neighbors let him
stew in his own juice.

713
01:18:29,528 --> 01:18:33,328
By all means,
do whatever you think best.

714
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:36,799
But I warn you:

715
01:18:36,868 --> 01:18:39,894
Don't come whining to me later.

716
01:18:46,745 --> 01:18:48,679
Bastards!

717
01:18:56,821 --> 01:18:59,312
What do they want me to do...
drop dead?

718
01:19:03,728 --> 01:19:06,993
With my wife,
it's always the same old...

719
01:19:17,909 --> 01:19:19,968
It's for me.

720
01:20:14,499 --> 01:20:17,093
<i>It's no use</i>
<i>playing innocent with me:</i>

721
01:20:17,168 --> 01:20:21,502
I've heard a good deal about you,
Monsieur Trelkovsky.

722
01:20:21,573 --> 01:20:25,100
You specialize in breaches
of the peace at night.

723
01:20:25,176 --> 01:20:28,737
I'm quite amazed, Inspector.

724
01:20:28,813 --> 01:20:31,247
No one has said anything to me.

725
01:20:33,985 --> 01:20:35,535
I'm certainly not
in the habit of making noise.

726
01:20:35,535 --> 01:20:36,866
I'm certainly not
in the habit of making noise.

727
01:20:36,937 --> 01:20:38,871
I have very few friends,
and I never entertain.

728
01:20:38,939 --> 01:20:43,774
I'm not interested in your stories.
I have other things to do.

729
01:20:43,844 --> 01:20:49,111
But I keep getting complaints. It's
my duty to maintain law and order.

730
01:20:49,182 --> 01:20:51,207
So I say it once and for all:

731
01:20:51,285 --> 01:20:53,446
Stop whatever it is
you're doing at night.

732
01:20:56,189 --> 01:20:59,522
- Trelkovsky... is that Russian?
- Polish.

733
01:21:00,861 --> 01:21:02,795
So you're not French.

734
01:21:02,863 --> 01:21:07,357
- I am a French citizen.
- Let me see your identity card.

735
01:21:19,746 --> 01:21:22,010
It's in a very poor state.

736
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:26,144
But you haven't registered
your change of address.

737
01:21:27,821 --> 01:21:30,449
15 Rue Sedan. Where is this?

738
01:21:30,524 --> 01:21:33,288
I'm terribly sorry.
I'll do it at once.

739
01:21:35,529 --> 01:21:38,430
You'd be well advised to.

740
01:21:38,498 --> 01:21:42,696
Right. This time I shall
close my eyes to the whole business.

741
01:21:42,769 --> 01:21:45,465
Just make sure I don't hear
any more about you.

742
01:21:45,539 --> 01:21:48,030
I won't have some little
troublemaker disturbing the peace.

743
01:21:48,108 --> 01:21:50,042
Thank you very much, Inspector.

744
01:21:52,212 --> 01:21:54,146
Good-bye.

745
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:12,564
Good afternoon, madame.

746
01:22:12,632 --> 01:22:15,795
I would like to know who registered
a complaint against me.

747
01:22:17,637 --> 01:22:20,162
Do you know who it was?

748
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:24,904
If you didn't make so much noise,
there wouldn't be any complaints.

749
01:22:24,978 --> 01:22:26,969
Was there a petition?

750
01:22:29,516 --> 01:22:33,714
Was it that woman that came to
see me the other day... Madame Dioz?

751
01:22:35,389 --> 01:22:38,984
You only have
yourself to blame.

752
01:22:39,059 --> 01:22:40,993
Did you sign it?

753
01:23:16,129 --> 01:23:20,225
That's it. She's won.
They've all signed it.

754
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:23,133
All except you, monsieur.
I've come to thank you.

755
01:23:23,203 --> 01:23:25,797
You're a good person.

756
01:23:25,872 --> 01:23:27,931
I don't like to get
mixed up in this kind of thing.

757
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:31,967
Nonsense. No, you are a good person.
I can see it in your eyes.

758
01:23:34,214 --> 01:23:36,239
I got even with them...

759
01:23:36,316 --> 01:23:39,752
and the concierge too;
she's as bad as all of them.

760
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:43,756
I paid them back all right.
They gave me the idea.

761
01:23:43,824 --> 01:23:46,349
Do you know what I did?

762
01:23:46,426 --> 01:23:49,156
I did it on the staircase...

763
01:23:49,229 --> 01:23:52,357
in front of everyone's door.

764
01:23:54,067 --> 01:23:55,796
It's their own fault.

765
01:23:55,869 --> 01:23:59,600
They gave me the idea.
I didn't do it by your door.

766
01:23:59,673 --> 01:24:02,107
I don't want to cause you
any trouble.

767
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:06,001
- How long ago?
- Just now.

768
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:10,907
I would love to see their faces
when they find out.

769
01:24:12,519 --> 01:24:14,987
It serves them right,
all of them.

770
01:24:15,055 --> 01:24:17,319
But they...
they'll say I did it!

771
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:19,381
Good night, monsieur.
Sleep well.

772
01:29:47,054 --> 01:29:48,988
Hey, look.

773
01:30:53,821 --> 01:30:56,119
They want to drive me
to suicide.

774
01:31:03,363 --> 01:31:06,958
All right.
I'll show them.

775
01:32:19,139 --> 01:32:21,505
Just shoes.

776
01:32:23,043 --> 01:32:27,571
Simply... Where in the world
did you find them?

777
01:32:35,022 --> 01:32:37,684
Eighty francs.
You're kidding.

778
01:32:37,758 --> 01:32:39,692
Supermarket, yes.

779
01:32:46,233 --> 01:32:49,669
She's not as young
as she thinks she is.

780
01:32:54,074 --> 01:32:56,599
Beautiful, beautiful.

781
01:32:56,677 --> 01:32:58,770
Adorable.

782
01:33:00,647 --> 01:33:03,878
A goddess, divine.

783
01:33:19,099 --> 01:33:21,033
I think I'm pregnant.

784
01:34:58,082 --> 01:34:59,947
Monsters!

785
01:35:03,688 --> 01:35:07,522
They'll never turn me
into Simone Choule.

786
01:35:07,592 --> 01:35:08,854
Never!

787
01:35:11,162 --> 01:35:12,595
Monsieur Trelkovsky.

788
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:19,301
Do you remember the conditions on
which I let you have this apartment?

789
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:21,463
I most certainly do,
Monsieur Zy.

790
01:35:21,539 --> 01:35:23,473
May I know what you're
referring to?

791
01:35:23,541 --> 01:35:25,509
I'm referring to what I said
about women.

792
01:35:25,576 --> 01:35:27,373
Oh, yes, of course.

793
01:35:27,445 --> 01:35:29,811
Then why do you
bring them around here?

794
01:35:31,716 --> 01:35:35,243
What? I never brought
any women around here.

795
01:35:35,319 --> 01:35:37,253
I know what I'm talking about.

796
01:35:37,321 --> 01:35:40,415
You had a woman up in your room.
You can't deny it.

797
01:35:41,559 --> 01:35:44,426
I'll turn a blind eye
to it this time...

798
01:35:44,495 --> 01:35:47,225
but this is the last time.

799
01:35:47,298 --> 01:35:49,232
I hope that's clear.

800
01:35:57,441 --> 01:35:59,671
Good morning,
Monsieur Trelkovsky.

801
01:36:12,390 --> 01:36:14,449
Bring me a coffee.

802
01:36:14,525 --> 01:36:16,857
- You don't want a chocolate?
- I just told you, I want a coffee.

803
01:36:16,928 --> 01:36:18,862
But you always have a chocolate.

804
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:21,990
You always serve me
without asking what I want.

805
01:36:22,066 --> 01:36:25,365
Now, today I am telling you.
I'd like a coffee.

806
01:36:34,946 --> 01:36:38,848
I'm sorry, but the problem is,
you see...

807
01:36:38,916 --> 01:36:42,352
the machine's broken down.

808
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:44,911
- Sure you won't have a chocolate?
- No!

809
01:36:44,989 --> 01:36:48,789
- Why the hell should I?
- It's nothing to get sore about.

810
01:36:48,859 --> 01:36:51,726
I'll have a glass of red wine.

811
01:36:51,796 --> 01:36:54,492
I suppose you're
out of Gauloises.

812
01:36:54,565 --> 01:36:56,760
That's right.
We've only got Marlboros.

813
01:36:56,834 --> 01:36:58,768
You can keep them.

814
01:37:00,371 --> 01:37:02,566
I know just what you are up to.

815
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:05,370
Goddamn murderers!

816
01:37:07,211 --> 01:37:10,044
No good looking at me like that.

817
01:37:10,114 --> 01:37:12,947
I know exactly
what your little scheme is.

818
01:37:31,502 --> 01:37:34,699
- What's wrong?
- My boat.

819
01:37:34,772 --> 01:37:38,071
- Which one?
- The red one.

820
01:37:43,314 --> 01:37:46,772
- What's your name?
- Patrick.

821
01:37:51,689 --> 01:37:54,852
And you've lost your boat...
the red one?

822
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:59,156
Okay, I'll get it back for you.

823
01:38:08,372 --> 01:38:10,431
Filthy little brat!

824
01:39:00,891 --> 01:39:02,153
Mother. Mother!

825
01:39:36,327 --> 01:39:38,290
It's him! He's there!

826
01:40:29,575 --> 01:40:31,202
I'll fight.

827
01:40:33,345 --> 01:40:35,575
I'll fight to the bitter end.

828
01:43:42,001 --> 01:43:43,935
Who is it?

829
01:43:44,003 --> 01:43:46,972
It's me, Trelkovsky.

830
01:43:52,544 --> 01:43:56,640
- Were you sleeping?
- What's the matter?

831
01:43:59,785 --> 01:44:02,618
Sorry to bother you
at this hour of the morning.

832
01:44:02,688 --> 01:44:06,681
Do you mind if I
stayed here for a while?

833
01:44:11,330 --> 01:44:13,264
You're strange.

834
01:44:14,867 --> 01:44:19,804
You must tell me.
I wouldn't mind, really.

835
01:44:19,872 --> 01:44:23,672
No. No, of course
you can stay.

836
01:44:32,584 --> 01:44:36,350
- Look, you're hurt.
- It's nothing, really.

837
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:43,526
- But it's filthy.
- That's nothing.

838
01:44:43,595 --> 01:44:47,497
Oh, wait, wait.
I think I've got some...

839
01:44:47,566 --> 01:44:49,693
some things here.

840
01:45:07,686 --> 01:45:09,881
How did you do that?

841
01:45:09,955 --> 01:45:12,651
It's them.

842
01:45:12,725 --> 01:45:15,193
Who?

843
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:17,194
They're trying to kill me.

844
01:45:20,499 --> 01:45:22,694
Drive me to suicide.

845
01:45:22,768 --> 01:45:25,999
What are you talking about?

846
01:45:26,071 --> 01:45:28,062
Who's trying to kill you?

847
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:31,303
Stella, I've been lying to you.

848
01:45:32,978 --> 01:45:35,811
I'm living in her apartment.

849
01:45:35,881 --> 01:45:38,213
Whose apartment?

850
01:45:38,283 --> 01:45:40,410
Simone's.

851
01:45:40,486 --> 01:45:43,819
I rented Simone Choule's apartment.

852
01:45:45,157 --> 01:45:48,615
- How did you rent it?
- She died because of the neighbors.

853
01:45:50,229 --> 01:45:52,459
It was a plot.

854
01:45:52,531 --> 01:45:55,914
A plot against Simone?
You're completely insane.

855
01:45:56,048 --> 01:45:57,982
I'm not insane. Listen.

856
01:45:58,050 --> 01:46:01,019
They forced her
to commit suicide.

857
01:46:01,086 --> 01:46:03,850
I can prove it.

858
01:46:03,922 --> 01:46:08,188
And they are trying
to do the same thing to me.

859
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:12,162
Everything's ready. They worked it
all out, every detail.

860
01:46:12,231 --> 01:46:15,359
Do you know what
they've been doing to me?

861
01:46:15,434 --> 01:46:17,834
It's...

862
01:46:17,903 --> 01:46:20,565
It's so appalling...

863
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:23,938
so incredible that
I can hardly tell you...

864
01:46:24,009 --> 01:46:27,137
yet it's true, I swear it.

865
01:46:27,212 --> 01:46:30,739
Oh, tell me.
Tell me. I'm listening.

866
01:46:34,653 --> 01:46:39,920
They've been trying to
turn me into Simone Choule.

867
01:46:42,695 --> 01:46:47,291
There now. I'm your friend.
I'm going to help you.

868
01:46:47,366 --> 01:46:49,493
Come now.

869
01:46:49,568 --> 01:46:53,971
You're exhausted.
Lie down.

870
01:46:57,476 --> 01:47:00,445
I'm going to leave Paris
in a couple of days.

871
01:47:00,512 --> 01:47:05,108
- They'll never find me.
- That's the best thing to do.

872
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:09,381
You're the only one
I can trust.

873
01:47:09,455 --> 01:47:11,389
Aren't you?

874
01:47:48,761 --> 01:47:51,559
It's me, Stella.

875
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:53,894
Don't be frightened.

876
01:47:55,334 --> 01:47:58,565
You do recognize me,
don't you?

877
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:04,234
Sorry.

878
01:48:04,309 --> 01:48:06,402
I was having a nightmare.

879
01:48:06,478 --> 01:48:08,173
I must get to work now.
I'm late.

880
01:48:08,247 --> 01:48:13,150
I'll be back around 8:00.
I've left your breakfast ready.

881
01:48:14,319 --> 01:48:18,255
- I love you.
- And I love you.

882
01:48:20,826 --> 01:48:23,761
I even went out and
bought you some croissants.

883
01:48:25,964 --> 01:48:28,330
Please stay with me.
Don't leave me alone.

884
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,334
Oh, now, listen.
I'm late.

885
01:48:30,402 --> 01:48:33,269
If you want to go out,
just leave the keys under the mat.

886
01:48:33,338 --> 01:48:37,297
I'll get another pair made tomorrow.
We'll each have our own set then.

887
01:48:39,812 --> 01:48:43,373
- Please don't go.
- Don't be naughty now.

888
01:48:43,448 --> 01:48:47,316
You're to be good
and stay here.

889
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:51,287
You've got everything you need.

890
01:48:51,356 --> 01:48:54,450
If you like, you can go out
and get some fresh air.

891
01:48:54,526 --> 01:48:57,051
I'll bring some food
back this evening.

892
01:48:57,129 --> 01:49:01,691
We'll eat in, or go out
to a restaurant, if you like.

893
01:49:01,767 --> 01:49:03,701
We'll see how you feel.

894
01:49:05,170 --> 01:49:07,297
See you tonight then.

895
01:50:10,669 --> 01:50:12,603
Is anyone there?

896
01:50:43,635 --> 01:50:46,001
Filthy bitch!

897
01:50:47,205 --> 01:50:49,571
They're all in it together.

898
01:51:32,918 --> 01:51:35,910
- Stop here. Stop, stop.
- Hey, what's wrong?

899
01:51:35,988 --> 01:51:38,980
Nothing. I'm getting out.

900
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:37,548
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

901
01:53:32,278 --> 01:53:35,441
Thank you, monsieur.
Thank you very much.

902
01:53:45,224 --> 01:53:47,886
Have you got any idea
where I can buy a gun?

903
01:53:49,528 --> 01:53:53,692
- I'll pay good money.
- Get the hell out of here, punk!

904
01:53:53,766 --> 01:53:58,294
- This bugger wants to buy a gun!
- What?

905
01:54:00,839 --> 01:54:02,466
I'll tell the cops,
you little shit!

906
01:54:31,837 --> 01:54:35,898
I told you not to drive so fast.
Now look what's happened.

907
01:54:49,121 --> 01:54:51,146
Monsieur, are you hurt?

908
01:54:51,223 --> 01:54:54,624
People who can't drive should
take taxis, you old jerks.

909
01:54:54,693 --> 01:54:58,390
How dare you say that! My wife
hasn't had an accident in 25 years.

910
01:54:58,464 --> 01:55:01,729
He's right. The guy walked
right under the wheels.

911
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:04,325
- I saw the whole thing.
- Let me through, please.

912
01:55:04,403 --> 01:55:06,667
Excuse me. Let me through.
Let me through.

913
01:55:06,739 --> 01:55:09,264
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm a doctor.

914
01:55:31,563 --> 01:55:33,394
Murderers.

915
01:55:35,601 --> 01:55:39,503
Believe me, my wife and I are
very upset about what has happened.

916
01:55:39,571 --> 01:55:41,835
Please stand back.
On the curb.

917
01:55:41,907 --> 01:55:44,398
- Back.
- Officer. This is how it happened.

918
01:55:44,476 --> 01:55:48,207
Your ID, please.
Yours too, monsieur.

919
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:51,078
You're very lucky.

920
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:53,710
Only a few scratches.

921
01:55:53,786 --> 01:55:55,617
Nothing broken.

922
01:55:56,555 --> 01:55:58,614
But you should have an X ray.

923
01:56:03,662 --> 01:56:07,462
It's not serious. A mild case of
delirium tremens, in my opinion.

924
01:56:07,533 --> 01:56:11,196
The driver and her husband made
a statement. They'll drive him home.

925
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:14,433
Is that all right, Doctor?
Or should I call for an ambulance?

926
01:56:14,506 --> 01:56:17,475
Well, if this gentleman can
manage it, it'd be fine.

927
01:56:17,543 --> 01:56:21,274
We'd be glad to give this poor man
a lift home. Of course.

928
01:56:27,453 --> 01:56:30,354
We'll take you home, huh?

929
01:56:39,164 --> 01:56:41,632
That is preposterous!
No! Please!

930
01:56:43,168 --> 01:56:45,102
- They were trying to kill me.
- Yeah?

931
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:47,536
They were playing football
with a human head.

932
01:56:47,606 --> 01:56:49,972
I'll give him a shot
of something to calm him down.

933
01:56:50,042 --> 01:56:52,340
No. No injection.

934
01:56:52,411 --> 01:56:54,174
I don't want any injection.

935
01:56:56,081 --> 01:56:58,015
I don't want an injection.

936
01:56:59,184 --> 01:57:01,209
They tried to kill me.

937
01:58:04,283 --> 01:58:06,217
Mirza, quiet down!

938
01:58:09,755 --> 01:58:15,250
Good evening, madam. This gentleman
has had a slight accident.

939
01:58:15,327 --> 01:58:17,921
Nothing serious, though.
Nothing to worry about, but...

940
01:58:17,996 --> 01:58:22,365
- What did he do now?
- Let's get him up to the apartment.

941
01:58:23,569 --> 01:58:25,503
How did it happen?

942
01:58:25,571 --> 01:58:29,098
He sort of jumped out
in front of the car, and...

943
01:58:29,174 --> 01:58:33,008
Luckily my wife
has very good reflexes.

944
01:58:34,947 --> 01:58:38,075
What's going on here?

945
01:58:38,150 --> 01:58:39,777
It's him again.

946
01:58:40,852 --> 01:58:43,184
Oh, that bastard!

947
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:03,530
Stay. Stay, Mirza.

948
02:01:19,152 --> 02:01:22,053
- What was that?
- Down in the courtyard.

949
02:01:47,814 --> 02:01:51,443
We'd better call an ambulance.
Go get one, quick.

950
02:01:52,785 --> 02:01:54,844
You shouldn't move!

951
02:01:59,092 --> 02:02:01,492
Monsieur, I swear
I am not Simone Choule.

952
02:02:01,561 --> 02:02:03,256
Quick, get him a blanket.

953
02:02:03,329 --> 02:02:06,230
Two suicides in succession.

954
02:02:06,299 --> 02:02:11,794
- It's quite unbelievable.
- Look at his clothes. He's insane.

955
02:02:11,871 --> 02:02:15,363
And we just finished
repairing the roof.

956
02:02:15,441 --> 02:02:19,275
I knew there was something wrong
with him the first time I saw him.

957
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:28,380
Oh, God, Monsieur Trelkovsky! Be
reasonable. Wait for the ambulance.

958
02:02:47,373 --> 02:02:50,206
You gang of killers!

959
02:02:50,276 --> 02:02:52,710
I'll show you some blood.

960
02:02:56,115 --> 02:02:58,709
You wanted a clean death,
didn't you?

961
02:02:58,785 --> 02:03:01,777
- Be reasonable.
- It's going to be dirty.

962
02:03:02,989 --> 02:03:05,150
Unforgettable.

963
02:03:05,224 --> 02:03:08,057
It was better last time,
wasn't it?

964
02:03:08,127 --> 02:03:10,061
Well, I'm not Simone Choule.

965
02:03:11,731 --> 02:03:13,665
I'm Trelkovsky!

966
02:03:25,011 --> 02:03:28,276
All right, all right.
What's going on?

967
02:03:28,347 --> 02:03:31,316
- A tenant jumped out of a window.
- Again?

968
02:03:31,384 --> 02:03:34,012
- You must get them wholesale.
- Where is he now?

969
02:03:34,086 --> 02:03:36,486
He's gone back up
to his apartment.

970
02:03:36,556 --> 02:03:39,821
I think he must have had
some kind of a brainstorm.

971
02:03:39,892 --> 02:03:41,416
He's gonna jump again!

972
02:03:42,528 --> 02:03:46,020
- Tuck into the gallery.
- Take it easy! Don't move!

973
02:03:46,098 --> 02:03:49,693
- We'll come up and get you, okay?
- Be reasonable now.

974
02:03:49,769 --> 02:03:52,670
- Please! It's enough.
- Why is this happening?

975
02:03:54,073 --> 02:03:58,874
- Oh, God, no.
- Don't do anything silly!

976
02:04:15,661 --> 02:04:17,754
Are you a friend of hers?

977
02:04:18,498 --> 02:04:20,125
Oh, I'm sorry.

978
02:04:23,736 --> 02:04:26,671
What on earth
could have happened?

979
02:04:26,739 --> 02:04:29,264
Why would she do
a thing like that?

980
02:04:31,210 --> 02:04:35,408
To tell you the truth,
I'm not a friend of hers at all.

981
02:04:35,481 --> 02:04:38,279
I hardly know her,
actually, but...

982
02:04:41,020 --> 02:04:42,954
Simone.

983
02:04:46,425 --> 02:04:49,622
You do recognize me,
don't you?

984
02:04:49,695 --> 02:04:53,392
It's me, Stella.

985
02:04:53,466 --> 02:04:56,435
Your friend, Stella.

986
02:04:56,502 --> 02:04:58,470
Don't you recognize me?
