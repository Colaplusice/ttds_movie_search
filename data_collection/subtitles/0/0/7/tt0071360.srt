1
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:41,498
# Won't you come home,
Bill Bailey? #

2
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:42,832
# Won't you come home? #

3
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:46,670
# I moan the whole night long #

4
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:49,672
# I'll do the cooking, honey,
I'll pay the rent #

5
00:00:49,798 --> 00:00:52,217
# I know I done him wrong #

6
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:53,677
# Yes, you did #

7
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:54,969
# Remember that rainy eve #

8
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:56,471
# She threw me out #

9
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:59,474
# With nothing but
a fine-tooth comb #

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,393
# But I know she's to blame #

11
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:03,436
# Yeah, ain't it a shame #

12
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:32,591
# Oh, Bill Bailey,
won't you please #

13
00:01:32,716 --> 00:01:34,759
# Bill Bailey,
won't you please come #

14
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:38,305
# Bill Bailey,
won't you please come home? #

15
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:57,574
# When the red, red robin #

16
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,077
# Comes bob,
bob, bobbin' along #

17
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:01,453
# Along #

18
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:02,954
# There'll be
no more sobbin' #

19
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,581
# When he starts throbbin' #

20
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,292
# His own sweet song #

21
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,293
# Wake up #

22
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,295
# Wake up, you sleepyhead #

23
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,296
# Get up #

24
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,923
# Get up, get out of bed #

25
00:02:13,048 --> 00:02:13,923
# Cheer up #

26
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:15,800
# Cheer up, the sun is red #

27
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:16,801
# Live, love #

28
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:18,762
# Laugh and be happy #

29
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:20,388
# What if I've been blue #

30
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:24,267
# Now I'm walkin' through
fields of flowers #

31
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:25,435
# Rain may glisten #

32
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:26,603
# But still I listen #

33
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,773
# For hours and hours #

34
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:31,149
# I'm just a kid again #

35
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:32,776
# Doin' what I did again #

36
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:35,153
# Singin' my song #

37
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:36,613
# When the red, red robin #

38
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,284
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

39
00:03:27,414 --> 00:03:28,748
# When the red, red robin #

40
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:31,167
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

41
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:32,669
# Along #

42
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,630
# There'll be no more sobbin' #

43
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:36,047
# When he starts throbbin' #

44
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:39,009
# His own sweet song #

45
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:40,009
# Wake up #

46
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:41,970
# Wake up, you sleepyhead #

47
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:42,971
# Get up #

48
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,140
# Get up, get out of bed #

49
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:46,349
# Cheer up #

50
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:48,018
# Cheer up, the sun is red #

51
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:51,229
# Live, love,
laugh, and be happy... #

52
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,946
I want to go over
to my place...

53
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:03,366
and start,
you know, getting it on...

54
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:05,452
I was terrible.

55
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:06,452
Yeah?

56
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:08,621
Did you ever, uh...
take ballet?

57
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:09,706
Be thankful.

58
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,626
Do you have a quarter for them?

59
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:14,335
Yes, I do.

60
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:21,551
# Bob, bob, bob, bob,
bobbin' along #

61
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:22,636
# Wake up #

62
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:24,888
# Wake up, you sleepyhead #

63
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,474
# Da da da da da da #

64
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,484
Well, what about me?

65
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:42,656
You'll see.

66
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:45,074
A lot of fun you are.

67
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,951
You're supposed to tease me...

68
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:48,995
give me hints,
make me guess, you know.

69
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:05,887
Oh, look. That's terrible.

70
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:08,598
He's not hurting anyone.

71
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,353
Neither are we.

72
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:15,480
Oh, God.

73
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,942
Every time I see
one of those old guys...

74
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,653
I always think the same thing.

75
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,739
What do you think?

76
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:25,615
I always think...

77
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:28,785
that he was once
somebody's baby boy.

78
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,287
Really, I do.

79
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:33,289
I think he was once
somebody's baby boy...

80
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:36,042
and he had a mother
and a father who loved him...

81
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:37,961
and now there he is...

82
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,671
half dead on a park bench...

83
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,299
and where are
his mother or his father...

84
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:44,467
all his uncles now?

85
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:47,721
Anyway, that's
what I always think.

86
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:50,223
How's he doing up there?

87
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,309
When they had
the newspaper strike...

88
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:54,769
We're gettin' better than 40%.

89
00:05:54,895 --> 00:05:57,063
How about second position?

90
00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:03,486
It's not so good.

91
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,215
Uh-oh. What have we here?

92
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,301
Come on, babies,
wet your lips there.

93
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,803
Give me some tongue.

94
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:29,304
Just a little tongue.

95
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,597
Come on.

96
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:36,520
How about a nice
wet French kiss now?

97
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:39,022
Come on. A nice wet one.

98
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,108
Pay attention
to your recordings.

99
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,904
She's coming in loud and clear.

100
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,407
Look, Mark. Do you see him?

101
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:51,076
The man with the hearing aid
like Charles.

102
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,077
There with the shopping bag.

103
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:55,079
Well, that's it for Paul.

104
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:56,581
They spotted him.

105
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,208
Give me the phones.

106
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,587
He's been following us all around.

107
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,256
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

108
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:07,133
We're spending too much time
together here.

109
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,135
No. Let's stay
just a little longer.

110
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,785
I got burned, Harry.

111
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,287
She looked at me.

112
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:36,788
I know. We heard.

113
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,290
Oh, did we hear.

114
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:40,667
What do you think?

115
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,087
I got some
good pieces, maybe 25%.

116
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:51,469
Paul, I'll call you
in a couple days...

117
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:52,929
if I need you.

118
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,932
Paul, you going
to the convention tomorrow?

119
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:56,933
You bet.

120
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,186
Hey, how about you, Harry?

121
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:00,311
Yeah. Maybe.

122
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:03,273
Little party like we did
two years ago?

123
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,274
Huh?

124
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,609
Hey, Stan?

125
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,110
See you, Harry.

126
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,237
Okay.

127
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,237
Here.

128
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,955
He's a nice guy for a cop.

129
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,582
You go.

130
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,876
I'll stay here a while.

131
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,879
Who's interested
in these two anyway?

132
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,382
I don't know for sure.

133
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,883
The Justice Department?

134
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,635
No.

135
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,012
I figure it must be
the Infernal Revenue.

136
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:37,015
Their tapes always
put me to sleep.

137
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,977
Since when are you
here to be entertained?

138
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,813
Sometimes it's nice to know
what they're talking about.

139
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:45,815
I don't care what
they're talking about.

140
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:49,235
All I want is
a nice, fat recording.

141
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,634
Hello, Mr Caul.

142
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,470
And happy birthday.

143
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,681
Happy birthday, Harry.

144
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,519
Happy birthday.

145
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,806
Hello.

146
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:24,974
Hello, uh, Mrs Evangelista?

147
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,975
Uh, yes.

148
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,520
This is Harry Caul
from upstairs.

149
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:30,605
Uh, uh...

150
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:31,773
Yes.

151
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,191
Well...

152
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,901
Thank you very much.

153
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:35,902
Thank you.

154
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,654
Uh-huh.

155
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,199
Yes, well,
you're really very nice.

156
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,200
Yes.

157
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,493
Uh, but...

158
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,245
I know, uh...

159
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,123
Yes, I found it. Yes.

160
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:51,668
But what I wanted to talk
to you about was, uh...

161
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,797
How did you put it
in the apartment?

162
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,341
Uh-huh.

163
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,217
Right.

164
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,512
Well, what about the alarm?

165
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,307
Oh, you did?

166
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:10,019
Well...

167
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:11,020
uh...

168
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:14,023
I thought I had the only key.

169
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:15,108
Uh-huh.

170
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:20,655
Well, what emergency
could possibly...

171
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,157
All right.

172
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:23,157
Yes.

173
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:26,160
Well, see, I would
be perfectly happy...

174
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:28,663
to have all
my personal things...

175
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,665
burned up in a fire...

176
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,168
because I don't
have anything personal.

177
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:34,669
Nothing of value.

178
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,671
Nothing personal
except my keys...

179
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,008
which I would like
to have the only copy of...

180
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,176
Mrs Evangelista.

181
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:44,846
Mrs Evangelista...

182
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,849
how'd you know
it was my birthday?

183
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,352
Nah. I don't remember
telling you.

184
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:54,689
Would you like to take
a guess how old I am?

185
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,692
44. Well,
that's a very good guess.

186
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,194
Mrs Evangelista...

187
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:04,449
as of today, my mail
will go to a post office box...

188
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,452
with a combination on it
and no keys.

189
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,537
Goodbye.

190
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,368
Morning, Harry.

191
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,368
Morning.

192
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,162
There's an article in here...

193
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:33,371
about the convention.

194
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,873
It mentions your name.

195
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:36,874
You're one of the notables...

196
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,377
who's going tomorrow night.

197
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,879
I told them I'd be there.

198
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,423
Listen to this here.

199
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,091
Listen.

200
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,594
"Among those
pre-eminent in the field...

201
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,096
expected to attend...

202
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,598
are Hal Lipset and Harry Caul...

203
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,100
from San Francisco.

204
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,601
Kenneth Sperry will speak...

205
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,603
on Surveillance and The Law.

206
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,646
Wait a minute.

207
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:01,357
Listen to this.
Where the hell is it?

208
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,110
"Also attending
will be William P. Moran...

209
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,111
of Detroit, Michigan."

210
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,448
Since when did William P. Moran
of Detroit, Michigan...

211
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,409
become pre-eminent in the field?

212
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,410
Oh, he's very big there.

213
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,287
You want some coffee?

214
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:19,000
He's the guy
that told Chrysler...

215
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,212
that Cadillac was
getting rid of its fins.

216
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,630
It was a while ago...

217
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,759
but it was a big thing
at the time.

218
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,479
December 2nd, 1 p.m.

219
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,897
Shopping bag...

220
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:41,982
unit "A".

221
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,158
December 2nd, 1 p.m.

222
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,286
Parabolic, unit "B".

223
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,962
December 2nd, 1 p.m.

224
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,006
City of Paris, unit "C".

225
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,074
# Wake up #

226
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,366
# Wake up, you sleepyhead #

227
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,869
# Da da da da da da #

228
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:37,453
What do you think?

229
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,165
I don't know what I'm going
to get him for Christmas yet.

230
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,501
He's already got everything.

231
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:45,003
He doesn't need
anything any more.

232
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,046
Well...

233
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,506
I haven't decided
what I'm going...

234
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,008
to get you yet.

235
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,976
...get him for Christmas yet.

236
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,436
He's already got everything.

237
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,939
He doesn't need
anything any more.

238
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:08,610
Well, I haven't decided
what I'm going to get you yet.

239
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,946
Well, you better start looking.

240
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,614
Well, what about me?

241
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,742
You'll see.

242
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,745
Whoo! A lot of fun you are.

243
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,747
You're supposed to tease me...

244
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,249
give me hints...

245
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,250
make me guess, you know.

246
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,752
Does it bother you?

247
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,753
What?

248
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,797
Walking around
in circles.

249
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,470
Oh, look. That's terrible.

250
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,471
He's not hurting anyone.

251
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,056
Neither are we.

252
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,228
Oh, God.

253
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:48,359
Every time I see one
of those old guys, I...

254
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,244
Every time I see one
of those old guys...

255
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,872
I always think
the same thing.

256
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,373
What do you think?

257
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,669
I always think he was once
somebody's baby boy.

258
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,421
No, really, I do.

259
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,423
I think he was once
somebody's baby boy...

260
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,218
and he had
a mother and a father...

261
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,720
who loved him...

262
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:17,720
and now there he is...

263
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,472
half dead on a park bench...

264
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,975
and where are his
mother or his father...

265
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,477
all his uncles now?

266
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,147
Anyway, that's what
I always think.

267
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:31,150
I always think how, when
they had the newspaper strike...

268
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,569
more of those old guys died.

269
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:37,324
50 of them froze
to death in one night.

270
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,446
Good afternoon.

271
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,948
May I help you?

272
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,992
Yes. Extension 746, please.

273
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,536
One moment, please.

274
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,121
Director's office.

275
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,582
Uh, yes, this is Mr Caul.

276
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,128
I have the material.

277
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,129
I'm calling
for an appointment.

278
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,297
I'm sorry.

279
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,300
The director has already
left for the day.

280
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,136
We'll call you back
tomorrow morning.

281
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,638
May I have
your telephone number, please?

282
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,140
I'm at a payphone...

283
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,642
and I don't have
a home telephone.

284
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,519
Hold on one moment, please.

285
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:54,651
Mr Caul?

286
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:55,652
Yes?

287
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,154
2:30 tomorrow afternoon.

288
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,655
2:30 in the afternoon?

289
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,658
Is that payment in full?

290
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,202
Whatever was arranged.

291
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,163
Thank you very much.

292
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,622
I'll be there.

293
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,035
Harry?

294
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,036
Hello, Amy.

295
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:31,415
I didn't think you were coming.

296
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,881
I brought some wine, um...

297
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,883
someone gave me
as a birthday present.

298
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,597
I didn't know
it was your birthday.

299
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,098
You want some?

300
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,265
Yeah.

301
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,683
I do.

302
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,488
How old are you, Harry?

303
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,741
42.

304
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,247
Sweet.

305
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,920
Does something special
happen between us...

306
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,422
on your birthday?

307
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,048
Like what?

308
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,884
Something personal.

309
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,388
What?

310
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,601
Like, uh, telling me
about yourself...

311
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,894
your secrets.

312
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,705
I don't have any secrets.

313
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,169
I'm your secret.

314
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,170
You do have secrets, Harry.

315
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,588
I know you do.

316
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:03,674
No.

317
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,675
Sometimes you come over here...

318
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,677
and you don't tell me.

319
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,680
Once I saw you
up by the staircase...

320
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,681
hiding...

321
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,433
watching...

322
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,519
for a whole hour.

323
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,777
You think you're going
to catch me at something.

324
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,445
You know?

325
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,782
I know. A woman can always tell.

326
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:34,037
You have a certain way
of opening the door.

327
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,875
First the key
goes in real quiet...

328
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,878
and then the door
comes open real fast...

329
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:45,007
like you think you'll
catch me at something.

330
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,647
Sometimes I even think
you're listening to me...

331
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,567
when I'm talking
on the telephone.

332
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,945
What are you talking about?

333
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,447
I don't know.

334
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,948
I just feel it.

335
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,658
Really, I do.

336
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,418
# Wake up #

337
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:25,255
# Wake up, you sleepyhead #

338
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,507
# Get up #

339
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,800
# Get up, get out... #

340
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,844
Why are you singing that?

341
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,680
It's pretty.

342
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,565
What's the matter?

343
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,192
Nothing.

344
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,694
It's just that, uh...

345
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,781
somebody else
was singing that today.

346
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,490
A girl?

347
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,783
Yes.

348
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,076
Who is she?

349
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,578
No. No. If isn't...

350
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:57,579
I'm jealous.

351
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:58,580
No.

352
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,082
Just somebody at work...

353
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,666
and she, uh...

354
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,461
She reminded me of you.

355
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,636
Where do you work, Harry?

356
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,140
Oh, different places,
different...

357
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,892
jobs, you know?

358
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,480
I'm kind of, uh,
a musician, you see.

359
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,772
Oh.

360
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,153
Freelance musician and, uh...

361
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,738
Uh-huh.

362
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,827
Where do you live?

363
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,829
Why can't I call you
over there?

364
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,582
'Cause I don't have a telephone.

365
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,795
Do you live alone?

366
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,928
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

367
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,764
'Cause it's your birthday.

368
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:05,104
I don't want people asking me
a lot of questions.

369
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,107
I want to know you.

370
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,447
Yes, I live alone.

371
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:15,782
Oh.

372
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:20,620
I don't feel like
answering any more questions.

373
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,004
Your rent is due.

374
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,174
Here's the money for it.

375
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,916
You never used to ask
a lot of questions.

376
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,919
Harry, I was so happy
when you came over tonight.

377
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,589
When I heard you open the door...

378
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:15,134
my toes were dancing
under the covers.

379
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:20,138
But I don't think I'm going
to wait for you any more.

380
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,881
I have a package
for the director.

381
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,883
All right. I'll take it.

382
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,636
No. I'm supposed to
hand it to him personally.

383
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,138
I have an appointment.

384
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,639
Are you Mr Caul?

385
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,141
Yes, I am.

386
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,643
A Mr Caul is here. All right.

387
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,145
Make yourself comfortable.

388
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,647
The director's assistant
will be right down.

389
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:34,606
There are some nice
Christmas cookies I made. Want one?

390
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:35,774
They're good.

391
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,317
No, thanks. I...

392
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,389
What do you see?

393
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,890
Oh, not much.

394
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:11,893
Here's your money..
$ 15.000 cash, as you asked.

395
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,395
These are our tapes?

396
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,064
I had an arrangement
with the director.

397
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,567
I was to give those
to him personally.

398
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,069
I understand.
He's not here this afternoon.

399
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,071
He's out of the country.

400
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:26,867
He asked me to get the tapes
and give you the money.

401
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:51,725
I guess I can just wait on this.

402
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,734
Now, look, don't get involved
in this, Mr Caul.

403
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,779
These tapes are dangerous.

404
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:07,782
You heard them.
You know what I mean.

405
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,659
Someone may get hurt.

406
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,838
Mr Caul, be careful.

407
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,872
Well, what about me?

408
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,373
You'll see.

409
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,376
Whoo! A lot of fun you are.

410
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:29,174
# When the red, red robin #

411
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:32,552
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

412
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,179
# Along #

413
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,060
Who started
this conversation anyhow?

414
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,645
You did.

415
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,564
I did not.

416
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,567
Yes, you did.
You just don't remember it.

417
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,201
Pretend like
I just told you a joke.

418
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:58,537
Ha ha ha ha.

419
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,124
Does it bother you?

420
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,125
What?

421
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,253
Walking around in circles.

422
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,589
Oh, look. That's terrible.

423
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,634
He's not hurting anyone.

424
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,219
Neither are we.

425
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,181
Oh, God.

426
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:21,685
Every time I see
one of those old guys...

427
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,187
I always think the same thing.

428
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:25,689
What do you think?

429
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,690
Yeah, what do you think?

430
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,985
I always think
that he was once some--

431
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,075
Hey, Harry, what do you say
we take a break?

432
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:40,787
We'll go to AI's Transbay.
I'll buy you a beer.

433
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,664
No. I want to finish this.

434
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,167
I thought you turned
those tapes in.

435
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,294
Stan, be quiet, will you?

436
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,757
Do you think we can do this?

437
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:54,759
I'm tired of drinking anyhow.

438
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,761
What a stupid conversation.

439
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,264
Stan, please.
I'm trying to work.

440
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,225
I'm tired of mostly everything.

441
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,726
Tired of me?

442
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,812
Tired of you... but not today.

443
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,316
What the hell they talking about,
for Christ's sakes?

444
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,319
Stanley, please,
I'm trying to get this done.

445
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,321
All right. Don't get excited.

446
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,158
Well, I'm getting fed up.

447
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,409
About what?

448
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:22,287
About your asking me questions
all day long.

449
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:24,748
Jesus.

450
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,958
Don't say that.

451
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:28,627
Well, for Christ's sakes!

452
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,628
Stan, don't say that
again, please.

453
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,630
Don't use that word in vain.

454
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,174
It bothers me.

455
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,177
What's the matter, Harry?

456
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,556
Your work's getting sloppy.

457
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:48,563
Later in the week,
Sunday maybe.

458
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:50,941
Sunday definitely.

459
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,820
We'd have a much better track...

460
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:57,280
if you'd paid more attention
to the recording...

461
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,783
and less to what
they were talking about.

462
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:03,119
Why do questions about
what's going on bother you?

463
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:06,122
I can't explain
the personal problems of my clients.

464
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:13,255
Jack Tar Hotel.

465
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:16,466
3:00.

466
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:19,261
Room 773.

467
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,638
If you filled me in
once in a while...

468
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:22,681
Ever think of that?

469
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:25,141
It has nothing to do
with either of us.

470
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,310
It's curiosity,
goddam human nature.

471
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:32,858
Listen, if there's
one sure-fire rule...

472
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,859
I've learned
in this business is...

473
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,862
I don't know anything about
human nature or curiosity.

474
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,865
That's not part of what I do.

475
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,660
This is my business,
and when I'm...

476
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,503
I'll see you later.

477
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:13,106
I think he's been
recording my telephone.

478
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:20,697
I love you.

479
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:23,700
We're spending too much time
together here.

480
00:37:23,826 --> 00:37:26,620
No. Let's stay
just a little longer.

481
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:44,471
I think he's been
recording my telephone.

482
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:07,053
He'd kill us
if he got the chance.

483
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:31,619
He'd kill us
if he got the chance.

484
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:22,170
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

485
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:28,593
It's been three months
since my last confession.

486
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:31,513
I...

487
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,061
These are my sins.

488
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:44,192
I've taken
the Lord's name in vain...

489
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,028
on several occasions.

490
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:50,115
I...

491
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:57,706
On a number of occasions, I've
taken newspapers from the racks...

492
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:00,208
without paying for them.

493
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:01,209
I...

494
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:10,177
have deliberately taken pleasure
in impure thoughts...

495
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,511
and...

496
00:41:12,805 --> 00:41:15,432
I've been involved
in some work...

497
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,934
that I think will be used...

498
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,437
to hurt these two young people.

499
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:22,647
It's happened to me before.

500
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:25,650
People were hurt
because of my... my work.

501
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:28,653
I'm... I'm afraid
it could happen again...

502
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:31,656
and I... I was in no way
responsible.

503
00:41:31,782 --> 00:41:33,200
I'm not responsible.

504
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:37,203
For these and all the sins
of my past life...

505
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:38,705
I am heartily sorry.

506
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:52,219
Hi. Can I help you?

507
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,679
You could explain
your system to me.

508
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:56,681
Mr Caul,
I'm Jim Storey.

509
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:58,225
How do you do?

510
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:01,144
Come in and take a look
at the system.

511
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,146
This is for
the surveillance...

512
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:05,148
of telephone
communication systems.

513
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:06,316
I see.

514
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:07,317
Now available.

515
00:42:07,443 --> 00:42:09,319
Here's the new LT 500.

516
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:13,991
If you're in surveillance,
you belong into the LT 500.

517
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:15,826
You can hear...

518
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:19,538
and know exactly which door
has been violated.

519
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:22,540
And you got your local alarms
on the doors...

520
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,542
which I'm sure you've heard.

521
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:25,919
It's quite noisy.

522
00:42:26,045 --> 00:42:28,422
It has a Super 8mm
camera in here...

523
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:30,423
and the dot, the 10:00 dot...

524
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:33,426
will show exactly what
the camera sees on the back.

525
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:35,428
It's a magazine-loaded camera.

526
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:36,680
Super 8mm...

527
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:38,181
William P. Moran.

528
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:41,268
William P. Moran
of Detroit, Michigan.

529
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:43,853
House courtesy telephone,
please.

530
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:50,193
That's your automatic
recorder actuator.

531
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,446
It undetectably
starts the recorder...

532
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:54,531
when the phone is lifted...

533
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:58,534
and shuts it off
when the receiver is put back.

534
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,535
What?

535
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:01,871
It's real nice, you know.

536
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:04,124
It's not your old-fashioned
voice actuator...

537
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,125
you know,
always starting the recorder...

538
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,627
when nobody was talking...

539
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:09,713
or shutting it off
in the middle...

540
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:11,214
of an important conversation.

541
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,133
Is it like the Moran actuator?

542
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:16,136
The Moran E-27 is a copy.

543
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,972
I won't let him even
smell my equipment any more.

544
00:43:19,098 --> 00:43:20,474
You in surveillance?

545
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:21,474
Yeah.

546
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,476
Law enforcement
or private operator?

547
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:24,519
Private.

548
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:28,023
You mind if I take
your name and address...

549
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:29,524
for our mailing list?

550
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,234
Harry Cau... Harry Caul?

551
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,736
I didn't recognize you.

552
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:35,738
Say, I wonder,
would you take a Model 510-A?

553
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:38,157
Free of charge. Just to test it.

554
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:40,159
You know, say, in return for...

555
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:43,663
that we could print
in our flier that you use it.

556
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:46,166
I build all my own equipment.
Thank you.

557
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,669
Maybe we could take a picture
of you by our booth.

558
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:52,088
It would be a great honour
for Spectre.

559
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:39,177
This is not helping crime.

560
00:44:39,303 --> 00:44:40,721
It's helping justice...

561
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:59,197
That may be affixed to
the subject's automobile--

562
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:00,365
Slide.

563
00:45:00,491 --> 00:45:03,327
and will transmit
a pulsating tone signal--

564
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:04,327
Slide.

565
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:05,829
which is highly detectable.

566
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:07,705
Harry, good to see you.

567
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:09,123
Beautiful suit.

568
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:10,625
You like it? It's French.

569
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:12,002
Oh.

570
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:15,004
Let's go get a drink and talk.

571
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:18,007
Requiring no knowledge
or skill in electronics.

572
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:20,093
Come on. It's a bore.

573
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:25,640
The TA-30 may be
installed and concealed...

574
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:29,227
under the dash
in a matter of seconds.

575
00:45:29,353 --> 00:45:33,231
Hey, come on. There's somebody
I want you to meet...

576
00:45:33,357 --> 00:45:34,733
a competitor of yours.

577
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:36,234
Hey, Bernie, old buddy.

578
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,736
Yeah, Paulie, what's up?

579
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:40,154
This is Harry Caul.
William P. Moran.

580
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,656
Harry Caul, my pleasure.

581
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:43,158
My friends call me Bernie.

582
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:45,285
I heard a lot about you.

583
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:47,162
Bernie just moved in
from Detroit.

584
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:49,664
He's the fella
that let Chrysler know...

585
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,666
Cadillac was
discontinuing its fins.

586
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,043
I heard.

587
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:55,545
You're a tough man
to get ahold of.

588
00:45:55,671 --> 00:45:59,049
I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time.

589
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:01,092
Take five. We'll get a drink.

590
00:46:01,218 --> 00:46:03,303
Maybe in a couple minutes.

591
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:06,223
Honey, sweetheart,
show time, all right?

592
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:10,143
I'd appreciate if you stuck around
for the demonstration.

593
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:12,771
Um, ladies and gentlemen.

594
00:46:12,896 --> 00:46:14,606
Ladies and gentlemen.

595
00:46:14,732 --> 00:46:17,276
Ladies and gentlemen,
what we have here...

596
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:20,278
is the Moran S-15
harmonica tap.

597
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:22,781
This electronic marvel
can be installed...

598
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:25,283
in a matter of two minutes.

599
00:46:25,409 --> 00:46:29,287
Notice here it has its own
nickel cadmium power source...

600
00:46:29,413 --> 00:46:32,290
so it cannot be detected
on the line.

601
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:34,626
Once installed,
it can be phoned...

602
00:46:34,752 --> 00:46:37,171
from any telephone
in the world...

603
00:46:37,254 --> 00:46:38,630
Singapore, Karachi, even Moscow.

604
00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:41,800
I say Moscow 'cause
you look Russian, sir...

605
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,301
with the beard.

606
00:46:43,427 --> 00:46:45,303
Just dial the target's
phone number...

607
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:47,305
pause before the last digit...

608
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:49,808
blow the harmonica tone
into the phone...

609
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:51,309
press the last digit.

610
00:46:51,435 --> 00:46:54,813
The phone will not ring
in the target's house.

611
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:56,314
Instead, the receiver...

612
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,317
will be turned into
an actual room microphone...

613
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:01,778
thus enabling surveillance
to take place.

614
00:47:01,904 --> 00:47:04,781
And now, by way of
an actual demonstration...

615
00:47:04,907 --> 00:47:09,286
we've installed one of these units
in my very own home.

616
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:11,788
I will now dial that number.

617
00:47:11,914 --> 00:47:12,789
Thank you.

618
00:47:17,753 --> 00:47:20,505
I pause before the last digit.

619
00:47:22,383 --> 00:47:23,300
Harmonica.

620
00:47:27,596 --> 00:47:29,848
I dial the last digit.

621
00:47:33,102 --> 00:47:35,979
You will note the phone
does not ring.

622
00:47:36,105 --> 00:47:38,482
Can we get away?

623
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:40,984
I don't know. Maybe I can.

624
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:42,694
Where's your husband?

625
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,905
He's out at a convention.

626
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:48,157
When will he be back?

627
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:49,659
Not until late.

628
00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:52,162
April Fool.
Just a little joke, folks.

629
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:54,163
That shows you
the possibilities...

630
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:56,165
Larry Peterson Burns.
Telephone call.

631
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,668
Thank you. The demonstration
is concluded.

632
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:02,088
I'd like you to take some
literature on your way.

633
00:48:02,172 --> 00:48:04,966
What did you think of that?
You like it?

634
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:06,468
That's a good item.

635
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:08,595
Good for
the catalogue suckers, huh?

636
00:48:08,721 --> 00:48:11,098
Here you go, Harry.
Have a free pen.

637
00:48:11,223 --> 00:48:12,098
You, too, Paulie.

638
00:48:12,224 --> 00:48:13,892
I'd rather have a free drink.

639
00:48:14,018 --> 00:48:15,602
Hey, me, too.

640
00:48:15,728 --> 00:48:17,604
Stanley, do me a favour, huh?

641
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,606
Mind the booth, all right?

642
00:48:19,732 --> 00:48:21,608
That's what I pay you for.

643
00:48:21,734 --> 00:48:24,903
Just a couple of minutes
to get a drink.

644
00:48:25,029 --> 00:48:26,488
Hi, Harry.

645
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:28,364
Hi, Stan.

646
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:29,365
That's right.

647
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:32,076
You two used to
work together, huh?

648
00:48:34,663 --> 00:48:38,124
That son of a bitch
stole my latest idea.

649
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,627
A lot of nice ladies
are here tonight.

650
00:48:40,753 --> 00:48:42,546
Forget it.
She's a part-time nun.

651
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:44,547
Hey, Harry, where you going?

652
00:48:44,673 --> 00:48:46,132
Go on without me.

653
00:48:46,258 --> 00:48:48,134
I'm going to talk to Stan.

654
00:48:48,218 --> 00:48:50,637
We'll meet you at
the chrome-dome exhibit.

655
00:48:50,763 --> 00:48:52,055
Don't be long, Harry.

656
00:49:02,691 --> 00:49:05,944
Since when are you
working for Moran, Stanley?

657
00:49:09,198 --> 00:49:10,741
Since yesterday.

658
00:49:10,866 --> 00:49:12,117
Mm-hmm.

659
00:49:12,201 --> 00:49:13,577
Listen, that wasn't serious.

660
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:16,121
That was just
a stupid argument.

661
00:49:16,205 --> 00:49:17,581
That wasn't it, Harry.

662
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:19,582
It's just time I moved up.

663
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:22,585
I don't want you
telling him about my things.

664
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:24,129
It's not ethical.

665
00:49:24,213 --> 00:49:27,591
There's not much you
ever let me in on.

666
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:30,135
Okay. I'll show you
some of the stuff.

667
00:49:30,219 --> 00:49:32,137
You won't show me anything.

668
00:49:32,221 --> 00:49:33,597
You'll keep it to yourself.

669
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:35,432
You know damn well you will.

670
00:49:35,557 --> 00:49:37,976
No, really, Stan, wait a while.

671
00:49:38,102 --> 00:49:39,978
Will you think about it?

672
00:49:40,104 --> 00:49:44,191
Don't do this to me now.

673
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:48,611
Some guy's following me.

674
00:49:48,737 --> 00:49:50,613
Who?

675
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:52,157
I don't know.

676
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:55,285
It has something to do
with the assignment last week.

677
00:49:55,411 --> 00:49:59,790
I don't know what it's about,
but I don't like it.

678
00:49:59,915 --> 00:50:03,084
Okay, all right.

679
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:05,754
Thanks, Stan.

680
00:50:09,758 --> 00:50:11,676
This is junk.

681
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:37,869
You have reached
a disconnected number.

682
00:50:37,995 --> 00:50:41,081
Will you please make sure you...

683
00:50:49,298 --> 00:50:50,215
Information.

684
00:50:50,299 --> 00:50:53,218
Number for
Amy Fredericks, please.

685
00:50:53,302 --> 00:50:54,678
It's a new listing.

686
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:56,721
One moment, please.

687
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:05,146
Sir, I see no listing
for Amy Fredericks.

688
00:51:05,272 --> 00:51:06,815
Thank you.

689
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:32,674
What are you doing here?

690
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,677
Take it easy.
I'm just a messenger.

691
00:51:35,803 --> 00:51:37,679
I brought you a drink.

692
00:51:37,805 --> 00:51:39,681
Why are you following me?

693
00:51:39,807 --> 00:51:42,184
I'm not following you.
I'm looking for you.

694
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:43,768
There's a big difference.

695
00:51:43,894 --> 00:51:46,271
How'd you know I was here?

696
00:51:46,397 --> 00:51:48,482
It's a convention
of wiretappers...

697
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,443
Oh, excuse me... surveillance
and security technicians.

698
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:52,944
It was a snap.

699
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:56,156
I'm not giving those tapes
to anybody but the director.

700
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:58,408
I know what you told me.

701
00:51:58,534 --> 00:52:00,202
All right, what's the message?

702
00:52:00,327 --> 00:52:03,455
We want you to deliver
the tapes on Sunday, 1:00.

703
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,956
The director will be there.

704
00:52:05,082 --> 00:52:07,667
He'll accept the tapes
from you, in person.

705
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:10,170
You tell him
I'll think about it.

706
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:27,187
Hey, Paulie!

707
00:52:27,271 --> 00:52:29,648
Come on!
Come on, let's go!

708
00:52:29,773 --> 00:52:32,650
Lurleen and Millard,
get in the back there.

709
00:52:32,776 --> 00:52:34,194
Stanley, get in front!

710
00:52:34,278 --> 00:52:37,197
I'm trying to dress up
the boss, okay?

711
00:52:37,281 --> 00:52:38,657
Take one out here.

712
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:41,367
Bernie, it's a
come-as-you-are party.

713
00:52:41,493 --> 00:52:44,954
Wait a minute!
All the girls up front!

714
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,207
I think you take a right...

715
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:48,625
then a left...

716
00:52:48,751 --> 00:52:51,462
Sons of bitches!
Those smart asses!

717
00:52:51,587 --> 00:52:54,214
Who the hell they think
they're tangling with?

718
00:52:54,298 --> 00:52:56,341
Easy, we're going
to have a party.

719
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:01,971
Millard, make them stop.

720
00:53:02,097 --> 00:53:03,139
Relax, honey.

721
00:53:03,265 --> 00:53:05,642
Paul's the best tail man
in the country.

722
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:07,644
Meredith, do you hear that?

723
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:08,687
Ha ha.

724
00:53:12,775 --> 00:53:13,650
Make-4, 111.

725
00:53:13,776 --> 00:53:15,152
I'm driving east on Lombard.

726
00:53:15,277 --> 00:53:19,322
I'd like a rolling 10-28 on...

727
00:53:19,448 --> 00:53:22,659
California 5-6-0...

728
00:53:22,785 --> 00:53:25,078
Boy Adam Lincoln.

729
00:53:25,204 --> 00:53:27,539
What are you calling
for a 10-28 for?

730
00:53:27,664 --> 00:53:29,332
Thanks.

731
00:53:32,211 --> 00:53:36,673
Hey, Willie Sanchez...
33654 14th Street...

732
00:53:36,799 --> 00:53:38,175
162 pounds...

733
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,885
5' 10 1/2" shit head!

734
00:53:52,815 --> 00:53:56,527
Want me to pick
that lock for you, Harry?

735
00:53:56,652 --> 00:53:58,528
Hey, this'll be the bar.

736
00:53:58,654 --> 00:54:00,030
It's freezing in here.

737
00:54:00,155 --> 00:54:01,489
Oh, boy, Harry.

738
00:54:01,615 --> 00:54:02,490
Okay.

739
00:54:02,616 --> 00:54:05,493
All right, the bar is now open.

740
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:06,494
Stanley.

741
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:07,495
Yes, sir.

742
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:09,497
How about a little music?

743
00:54:09,623 --> 00:54:12,000
The man wants a little music.

744
00:54:12,126 --> 00:54:14,628
Harry, you got a nice shop here.

745
00:54:30,269 --> 00:54:33,647
I was rereading Dear Abby
the other night.

746
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:37,150
There was a letter from a fella
called "Lonely and Anonymous."

747
00:54:37,276 --> 00:54:39,152
I think it was Harry.

748
00:54:39,278 --> 00:54:41,321
Hey!

749
00:54:42,698 --> 00:54:43,615
Ahh.

750
00:54:43,741 --> 00:54:45,576
Where's the club soda?

751
00:54:47,286 --> 00:54:49,788
Let me tell you
something about Harry Caul.

752
00:54:49,913 --> 00:54:51,164
There you go.

753
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:53,375
I know you heard this
a thousand times...

754
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,293
but let me say it again.

755
00:54:55,419 --> 00:54:56,795
Here's to Harry...

756
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,296
the best, bar none.

757
00:54:58,422 --> 00:54:59,798
I'll drink to that.

758
00:54:59,923 --> 00:55:01,174
Best what?

759
00:55:01,258 --> 00:55:04,135
The best bugger
on the West Coast.

760
00:55:04,261 --> 00:55:07,138
Who's the best bugger
on the East Coast?

761
00:55:07,264 --> 00:55:08,139
Me.

762
00:55:08,265 --> 00:55:10,141
I'll drink to that, too.

763
00:55:10,267 --> 00:55:11,434
I'll bet you will.

764
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,228
I'll bet you will.

765
00:55:16,148 --> 00:55:20,527
It's funny we never bumped
into each other in New York.

766
00:55:20,652 --> 00:55:22,028
Why is that funny?

767
00:55:22,154 --> 00:55:24,614
We're in the same
business, same city.

768
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:27,159
I figure we'd bump
into each other.

769
00:55:27,242 --> 00:55:29,619
I didn't know
you came from New York.

770
00:55:29,745 --> 00:55:32,622
Are you kidding?
Harry's famous in New York.

771
00:55:32,748 --> 00:55:35,792
You know the only one
I couldn't figure out?

772
00:55:35,918 --> 00:55:39,796
The welfare fund back in '68.

773
00:55:39,922 --> 00:55:41,798
How'd you know about that?

774
00:55:41,924 --> 00:55:43,800
Everybody in the biz knew.

775
00:55:43,926 --> 00:55:46,303
Nobody knows how you did it.

776
00:55:46,428 --> 00:55:47,637
Hmm?

777
00:55:47,763 --> 00:55:50,182
How'd you do it, Harry?

778
00:55:50,265 --> 00:55:51,182
Harry.

779
00:55:51,266 --> 00:55:52,183
Hmm?

780
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:53,643
10 cents a dance.

781
00:55:53,769 --> 00:55:54,644
Come on.

782
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:55,687
Ooh.

783
00:56:01,235 --> 00:56:02,402
You all right?

784
00:56:02,528 --> 00:56:03,904
You hurt yourself?

785
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:05,822
No. Don't worry about my head.

786
00:56:05,948 --> 00:56:07,824
It happens all the time.

787
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:10,327
When I was a little baby...

788
00:56:10,452 --> 00:56:13,830
I loved to love to bang my head
up against the wall.

789
00:56:13,956 --> 00:56:17,334
Sometimes I still feel
like doing it. It's comforting.

790
00:56:17,459 --> 00:56:19,335
I tapped my first telephone...

791
00:56:19,461 --> 00:56:21,838
when I was 12 years old...

792
00:56:21,964 --> 00:56:23,131
12 years old.

793
00:56:23,257 --> 00:56:26,635
It was a hallway payphone
where I lived.

794
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,637
For six months,
they didn't know who it was.

795
00:56:29,763 --> 00:56:32,640
My father, he was proud as hell.

796
00:56:32,766 --> 00:56:34,142
He was beaming.

797
00:56:34,268 --> 00:56:35,269
Yeah, boy.

798
00:56:35,394 --> 00:56:38,105
"That Bernie's got a real brain,"
he said.

799
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:41,066
From then on,
it's been all uphill, Harry.

800
00:56:41,191 --> 00:56:45,153
I got contacts you
wouldn't believe.

801
00:56:45,279 --> 00:56:47,614
Here. Well, bring them over.

802
00:56:51,118 --> 00:56:52,494
Take a cab over.

803
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:55,496
Nothing's sacred
with you, is it, Harry?

804
00:56:55,622 --> 00:56:57,498
Sure. The more, the merrier.

805
00:56:57,624 --> 00:57:00,668
We'll be here all night.

806
00:57:00,794 --> 00:57:02,587
Oh! You son of a..

807
00:57:02,713 --> 00:57:05,590
Ha ha ha ha!

808
00:57:05,716 --> 00:57:07,134
What's the matter, Harry?

809
00:57:07,217 --> 00:57:09,135
Can't you take a vacation?

810
00:57:09,219 --> 00:57:12,138
When are you getting
a new scrambler, Harry?

811
00:57:12,222 --> 00:57:14,933
This went out
with the Trojan War.

812
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:18,145
Come on.
I want to hear all about you.

813
00:57:18,228 --> 00:57:20,146
Really obsolete, you know that?

814
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:22,607
Harry got himself a girlfriend.

815
00:57:22,733 --> 00:57:24,568
Watch out, Harry.

816
00:57:24,693 --> 00:57:26,111
Where are you from?

817
00:57:27,696 --> 00:57:28,571
New York.

818
00:57:28,697 --> 00:57:31,574
I used to live in New York.

819
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,119
First I worked
as a receptionist...

820
00:57:34,203 --> 00:57:37,122
and then I got
promoted to secretary.

821
00:57:37,206 --> 00:57:40,125
And then I was promoted
to gal Friday...

822
00:57:40,209 --> 00:57:42,586
and special assistant
to the boss...

823
00:57:42,711 --> 00:57:44,629
and then I married him.

824
00:58:03,023 --> 00:58:05,316
Do you live far from here?

825
00:58:11,532 --> 00:58:13,909
Harry?

826
00:58:14,034 --> 00:58:16,911
Are you still married?

827
00:58:17,037 --> 00:58:18,913
Oh, I don't know.

828
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:20,415
Probably.

829
00:58:22,543 --> 00:58:24,419
I guess maybe I am.

830
00:58:24,545 --> 00:58:26,838
Last time I heard...

831
00:58:26,964 --> 00:58:29,841
Well, he was trying to
scrape up enough money...

832
00:58:29,967 --> 00:58:31,843
to buy another hardware store.

833
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:33,220
Yeah.

834
00:58:33,345 --> 00:58:37,182
And I ended up out here
in San Francisco, unemployed...

835
00:58:37,307 --> 00:58:40,184
which is the entire story
of my life...

836
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:42,687
up until tonight.

837
00:58:56,493 --> 00:58:59,370
Here's to you. Salute.

838
00:58:59,496 --> 00:59:02,373
You don't like me
very much, do you?

839
00:59:02,499 --> 00:59:05,376
You don't want to
talk to me or anything.

840
00:59:05,502 --> 00:59:06,920
I didn't say that.

841
00:59:19,516 --> 00:59:21,893
Something is on your mind.

842
00:59:22,019 --> 00:59:23,895
I wish you'd tell me.

843
00:59:24,021 --> 00:59:25,397
I really do.

844
00:59:25,522 --> 00:59:28,358
I wish that you'd feel
that you could talk to me...

845
00:59:28,484 --> 00:59:30,861
and that we could be friends.

846
00:59:30,986 --> 00:59:34,698
I mean aside from
all of this junk.

847
00:59:56,845 --> 00:59:59,180
Would you, um...

848
00:59:59,306 --> 01:00:03,393
If you were a girl who'd
waited for someone...

849
01:00:11,026 --> 01:00:14,654
You can trust me.

850
01:00:17,533 --> 01:00:20,410
Well, you never really knew...

851
01:00:20,536 --> 01:00:23,413
when he was going to
come to see you.

852
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:25,916
You just lived in a room alone...

853
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:28,334
and you knew nothing about him.

854
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,336
And if you loved him...

855
01:00:30,462 --> 01:00:32,338
and were patient with him...

856
01:00:32,464 --> 01:00:35,341
and even though
he didn't dare ever...

857
01:00:35,467 --> 01:00:38,845
tell you anything
about himself personally...

858
01:00:40,973 --> 01:00:43,350
Even though he may
have loved you...

859
01:00:43,475 --> 01:00:45,351
would you...

860
01:00:45,477 --> 01:00:47,854
Would I what?

861
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,356
Would you...

862
01:00:50,983 --> 01:00:53,527
Would you go back to him?

863
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:00,366
Well, how would I know...

864
01:01:00,492 --> 01:01:03,786
How would I know
that he loved me?

865
01:01:11,503 --> 01:01:14,380
You'd have no way of knowing.

866
01:01:26,935 --> 01:01:28,311
Hey, Harry!

867
01:01:28,437 --> 01:01:31,815
Did you hear the one about
the broad who busted Vegas?

868
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:33,858
She wore a see-through blouse.

869
01:01:57,966 --> 01:02:00,343
Where are you going?

870
01:02:00,469 --> 01:02:03,263
Hey! Hey!

871
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,462
You know something, Harry?

872
01:02:35,587 --> 01:02:38,339
12 years ago, I recorded
every telephone call...

873
01:02:38,465 --> 01:02:40,341
made by the
presidential nominee...

874
01:02:40,467 --> 01:02:42,343
of a major political party.

875
01:02:42,469 --> 01:02:43,845
I don't want to say which party.

876
01:02:43,971 --> 01:02:46,348
Everywhere he went,
that's where I was.

877
01:02:46,473 --> 01:02:48,224
Coast to coast, I was listening.

878
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:50,226
I'm not saying I elected...

879
01:02:50,352 --> 01:02:52,812
the president of
the United States...

880
01:02:52,938 --> 01:02:55,231
but you can draw
your own conclusions.

881
01:02:55,357 --> 01:02:57,859
I mean, he lost.

882
01:02:57,985 --> 01:02:59,861
Harry, tell them
about the time...

883
01:02:59,987 --> 01:03:01,947
you put the bug
in the parakeet.

884
01:03:02,072 --> 01:03:02,947
Parakeet?

885
01:03:03,073 --> 01:03:04,407
No kidding.

886
01:03:04,533 --> 01:03:07,410
Harry one time actually
put a microphone...

887
01:03:07,536 --> 01:03:08,912
in a little parakeet.

888
01:03:09,038 --> 01:03:10,414
Is that right?

889
01:03:10,539 --> 01:03:12,874
Parakeets don't happen
to be my thing...

890
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,377
but I sure would
like to know...

891
01:03:15,502 --> 01:03:18,379
how you did
the teamster local back in '68.

892
01:03:18,505 --> 01:03:19,881
What was that?

893
01:03:20,007 --> 01:03:22,884
Don't you get papers
in Chicago, Millard?

894
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:24,386
Probably out on strike.

895
01:03:24,511 --> 01:03:26,804
It was all over the front pages.

896
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:29,307
Harry was working
for the attorney general.

897
01:03:29,433 --> 01:03:32,310
You didn't know I knew, did you?

898
01:03:32,436 --> 01:03:34,813
The president of
this teamster local...

899
01:03:34,938 --> 01:03:37,315
set up a phoney welfare fund.

900
01:03:37,441 --> 01:03:40,819
I mean, you correct me
on the details, Harry.

901
01:03:40,944 --> 01:03:43,321
I may be a little fuzzy.

902
01:03:43,447 --> 01:03:45,323
Only two people seemed to know...

903
01:03:45,449 --> 01:03:47,325
the president and his accountant.

904
01:03:47,451 --> 01:03:49,744
They only talked about it
on fishing trips.

905
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:51,246
On a private boat...

906
01:03:51,372 --> 01:03:53,832
That was the only place
they talked details.

907
01:03:53,957 --> 01:03:56,000
That boat was bug-proof.
That's a fact.

908
01:03:56,126 --> 01:03:58,503
They wouldn't strike up
a conversation...

909
01:03:58,629 --> 01:04:01,506
if there was another boat
on the horizon.

910
01:04:01,632 --> 01:04:04,009
That didn't stop Harry, did it?

911
01:04:04,134 --> 01:04:05,510
No, he recorded everything.

912
01:04:05,636 --> 01:04:07,346
Nobody knows
how you did it though.

913
01:04:07,471 --> 01:04:09,347
Caused a hell of a scandal.

914
01:04:09,473 --> 01:04:10,724
Why?

915
01:04:10,849 --> 01:04:13,351
No reason.
Three people were murdered.

916
01:04:13,477 --> 01:04:17,647
Harry's a bit too modest
to tell us how he did it.

917
01:04:20,484 --> 01:04:22,360
It had nothing to do with me.

918
01:04:22,486 --> 01:04:24,863
I just turned in the tapes.

919
01:04:24,988 --> 01:04:27,323
The president thought
the accountant talked.

920
01:04:27,449 --> 01:04:29,325
Nobody really knows for sure.

921
01:04:29,451 --> 01:04:30,827
Three days later...

922
01:04:30,953 --> 01:04:33,830
they found the accountant,
his wife, and kid...

923
01:04:33,956 --> 01:04:36,833
naked and tied up in the house...

924
01:04:36,959 --> 01:04:39,836
Hands and feet
tied up with rope...

925
01:04:39,962 --> 01:04:42,339
all the hair on their bodies
shaved off.

926
01:04:42,464 --> 01:04:44,841
The heads were found
in different places.

927
01:04:44,967 --> 01:04:46,343
They killed them?

928
01:04:46,468 --> 01:04:47,844
No. They gift-wrapped them.

929
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:49,846
This is ancient history now.

930
01:04:49,972 --> 01:04:51,348
Harry, how'd you do it?

931
01:04:51,473 --> 01:04:54,851
What they do with the tapes
is their business.

932
01:04:54,977 --> 01:04:58,855
Next thing I knew,
you moved out of New York.

933
01:04:58,981 --> 01:05:01,358
It had nothing to do with me.

934
01:05:01,483 --> 01:05:03,860
Come on, show and tell.
How'd you do it?

935
01:05:03,986 --> 01:05:06,029
For God's sake, tell him.

936
01:05:10,993 --> 01:05:12,369
Turn it off, Stan.

937
01:05:12,494 --> 01:05:13,703
What for?

938
01:05:13,829 --> 01:05:16,039
Stan, turn it off.

939
01:05:16,165 --> 01:05:18,208
They ought to hear this.

940
01:05:18,334 --> 01:05:20,377
It's the best thing
you've ever done.

941
01:05:24,006 --> 01:05:26,299
What was that, Stan?

942
01:05:28,135 --> 01:05:32,806
Well, it's the assignment
that Harry did this week.

943
01:05:32,931 --> 01:05:34,307
It'll make history.

944
01:05:34,433 --> 01:05:35,809
Yeah?

945
01:05:35,934 --> 01:05:39,312
There's no moment between
human beings that I cannot record...

946
01:05:39,438 --> 01:05:42,983
and there's no method
that I cannot figure out.

947
01:05:43,108 --> 01:05:45,985
I could figure out
any of Harry's schemes, right?

948
01:05:46,111 --> 01:05:48,738
Come on, come on. Try me.

949
01:05:48,864 --> 01:05:51,741
Let me give him
the assignment, Harry.

950
01:05:51,867 --> 01:05:54,035
Yeah.

951
01:05:59,041 --> 01:06:02,419
This is a quad
in the centre of the city.

952
01:06:02,544 --> 01:06:04,921
These are steps,
benches all around.

953
01:06:05,047 --> 01:06:06,423
It's 12:00 noon...

954
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:08,424
which means
that it's lunchtime...

955
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:11,427
for the people working
in these offices.

956
01:06:11,553 --> 01:06:13,429
They're walking, talking,
having lunch...

957
01:06:13,555 --> 01:06:14,931
and it's crowded.

958
01:06:15,057 --> 01:06:16,433
Naturally. Come on, Stan.

959
01:06:16,558 --> 01:06:19,435
Okay. Two people are constantly
moving in circles...

960
01:06:19,561 --> 01:06:21,437
in and out of the crowd.

961
01:06:21,563 --> 01:06:24,148
We don't know whether
they'll sit down or what.

962
01:06:24,233 --> 01:06:26,443
They're convinced
they can't be recorded...

963
01:06:26,568 --> 01:06:29,946
because they're in a crowd
and constantly moving.

964
01:06:30,072 --> 01:06:31,448
Yet, they're the target.

965
01:06:31,573 --> 01:06:33,866
The assignment is
to get everything they say.

966
01:06:33,992 --> 01:06:35,952
How would you do it?

967
01:06:36,078 --> 01:06:37,954
One system won't do it.

968
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,956
I could've told you that.

969
01:06:40,082 --> 01:06:41,458
Why didn't you?

970
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:43,459
Go on, figure it out.

971
01:06:43,585 --> 01:06:45,378
You get to their clothes first.

972
01:06:45,504 --> 01:06:46,880
You pre-rig their clothes.

973
01:06:47,006 --> 01:06:48,882
There's no way of telling...

974
01:06:49,008 --> 01:06:50,300
what they're
going to be wearing.

975
01:06:50,426 --> 01:06:52,803
Get somebody to bump into them.

976
01:06:52,928 --> 01:06:56,222
Get a drunk to plant
a pin mike on them.

977
01:06:56,348 --> 01:06:58,516
They've been bugged before.
It's too risky.

978
01:06:58,642 --> 01:06:59,893
I got it.

979
01:07:01,103 --> 01:07:03,897
You hire a lip-reader
with binoculars.

980
01:07:04,023 --> 01:07:06,900
No. The client wants
their actual voice.

981
01:07:07,026 --> 01:07:08,902
Why?

982
01:07:09,028 --> 01:07:10,821
So he can believe it.

983
01:07:10,946 --> 01:07:13,323
All right. I'll figure it out.

984
01:07:13,449 --> 01:07:16,410
I don't know.
It must've been an expensive show.

985
01:07:16,535 --> 01:07:17,911
Who was so interested?

986
01:07:18,037 --> 01:07:19,413
Yeah, was it us?

987
01:07:19,538 --> 01:07:20,413
Who's us?

988
01:07:20,539 --> 01:07:21,414
Federal government.

989
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:22,415
Private party.

990
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:25,418
It would take
at least four passes.

991
01:07:25,544 --> 01:07:27,420
I did it in three.

992
01:07:27,546 --> 01:07:30,423
Three? That's very nice.
What did you use?

993
01:07:30,549 --> 01:07:31,925
Three-stage directional
microphones...

994
01:07:32,051 --> 01:07:34,928
with Mosfet amplifier
of my own design.

995
01:07:35,054 --> 01:07:37,931
We got another 20% conventionally
just tailing them.

996
01:07:38,057 --> 01:07:38,932
Paul did.

997
01:07:39,058 --> 01:07:41,852
It was beautiful.
It really was.

998
01:07:41,977 --> 01:07:44,354
It was a work of art.

999
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,857
You should have
seen it, though.

1000
01:07:46,982 --> 01:07:48,441
These new microphones
are just incredible.

1001
01:07:48,567 --> 01:07:50,360
I couldn't believe it myself.

1002
01:07:50,486 --> 01:07:52,362
We were 200 yards away.

1003
01:07:52,488 --> 01:07:53,864
It was absolutely readable.

1004
01:07:53,989 --> 01:07:56,116
I broke in a couple
of newsreel cameramen.

1005
01:07:56,241 --> 01:07:57,617
You should have
been there, Bernie.

1006
01:07:57,743 --> 01:07:59,035
What did they do?

1007
01:07:59,161 --> 01:08:01,454
They took the cross hairs
of the telescope...

1008
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:03,957
and lined it up on the mouths...

1009
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:06,960
No. The boy and the girl.
What did they do?

1010
01:08:07,086 --> 01:08:08,462
Oh, I don't know.

1011
01:08:08,587 --> 01:08:10,964
But it was beautiful,
something to see.

1012
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:12,466
Yeah. Sounds very pretty.

1013
01:08:12,591 --> 01:08:15,468
I'd like to take
a look at that mike, too.

1014
01:08:15,594 --> 01:08:16,970
There it is.

1015
01:08:17,096 --> 01:08:18,472
Oh.

1016
01:08:18,597 --> 01:08:21,725
I always said
we should be partners, Harry.

1017
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:25,478
You're the best, but you
and me together, that'd be tops.

1018
01:08:25,604 --> 01:08:29,399
I need a quick look at
your plans and devices.

1019
01:08:29,525 --> 01:08:31,443
I got all the
manufacturing plants.

1020
01:08:31,568 --> 01:08:34,404
We could make a fortune
selling to Uncle Sam.

1021
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:37,407
Did you hear about
the fag wiretapper...

1022
01:08:37,533 --> 01:08:40,410
who could only tap
a Princess phone?

1023
01:08:40,536 --> 01:08:41,453
No.

1024
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,916
Made that up yourself, huh?

1025
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:49,419
It's pretty funny.

1026
01:08:49,545 --> 01:08:50,921
Can I cut in?

1027
01:08:51,046 --> 01:08:53,923
He's got a hell
of a sense of humour.

1028
01:08:54,049 --> 01:08:55,925
I'm talking about
making millions...

1029
01:08:56,051 --> 01:08:57,927
he's making with the jokes.

1030
01:08:58,053 --> 01:08:58,928
Come on!

1031
01:08:59,054 --> 01:09:00,430
Thanks a lot.

1032
01:09:00,556 --> 01:09:02,432
What do you say, Harry?

1033
01:09:02,558 --> 01:09:04,935
How about going
into a partnership?

1034
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:07,937
I could use a partner,
so could you.

1035
01:09:08,063 --> 01:09:09,439
50-50, how about it?

1036
01:09:09,565 --> 01:09:11,275
I don't need anyone.

1037
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,776
That's all right.

1038
01:09:12,901 --> 01:09:15,778
I do pretty good
on my own, anyway.

1039
01:09:15,904 --> 01:09:19,282
You got to give credit
where credit's due, right?

1040
01:09:19,408 --> 01:09:20,283
Abracadabra, Harry.

1041
01:09:20,409 --> 01:09:22,285
See, I'm number two, Harry.

1042
01:09:22,411 --> 01:09:24,287
I have to try harder.

1043
01:09:24,413 --> 01:09:27,416
Would you, um...
If you were a girl...

1044
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:28,917
who'd waited for someone...

1045
01:09:29,043 --> 01:09:30,419
You can trust me.

1046
01:09:30,544 --> 01:09:33,922
Harry, that's you and me
when we were out there.

1047
01:09:34,048 --> 01:09:35,924
What? No shit. Ha ha ha.

1048
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:39,428
It's the Moran Super P-7
pen mike and transmitter.

1049
01:09:39,553 --> 01:09:40,720
That's terrific!

1050
01:09:40,846 --> 01:09:42,722
The bugger got bugged, huh?

1051
01:09:42,848 --> 01:09:44,224
He got you, Harry.

1052
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:47,227
And if you loved him
and were patient with him...

1053
01:09:47,353 --> 01:09:50,439
and even though
he didn't dare ever...

1054
01:09:50,564 --> 01:09:53,733
tell you anything about
himself personally...

1055
01:09:53,859 --> 01:09:55,235
Hey, touch, Harry.

1056
01:09:55,361 --> 01:09:57,738
That's wild.
When did you do that?

1057
01:09:57,863 --> 01:10:01,741
How do you like it?
What do you think?

1058
01:10:01,867 --> 01:10:06,830
Would you...
Would you go back to him?

1059
01:10:06,955 --> 01:10:10,041
I think you better
turn it off and get out.

1060
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:14,045
Are you kidding? It's just
a joke, for Christ's sakes.

1061
01:10:14,171 --> 01:10:17,549
Bernie, Harry don't like you
to say "Christ's sakes."

1062
01:10:17,675 --> 01:10:21,011
Well, I'm sorry, Harry.
Are you crazy, too, Stanley?

1063
01:10:21,136 --> 01:10:22,011
What's wrong?

1064
01:10:22,137 --> 01:10:24,013
Let's have a party here.

1065
01:10:24,139 --> 01:10:25,515
Paul, it's getting late.

1066
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:27,351
Come on, take it easy.

1067
01:10:27,476 --> 01:10:28,351
Come on.

1068
01:10:28,477 --> 01:10:29,352
Hey, Millard.

1069
01:10:29,478 --> 01:10:31,354
Know what these things cost?

1070
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,856
This cost 1.500 beans.

1071
01:10:32,981 --> 01:10:34,857
On the house, from me to you.

1072
01:10:37,486 --> 01:10:39,446
Very nice to meet you.

1073
01:10:41,448 --> 01:10:42,907
It's only a joke.

1074
01:10:43,033 --> 01:10:44,409
Meredith?

1075
01:10:44,535 --> 01:10:45,911
He's got no sense of humour.

1076
01:10:46,036 --> 01:10:48,413
No. I'm going to stay here.

1077
01:10:48,539 --> 01:10:49,456
Paul!

1078
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:52,292
Okay.

1079
01:10:55,546 --> 01:10:57,130
I forgot my bag.

1080
01:10:59,383 --> 01:11:00,759
Harry, I'm really sorry.

1081
01:11:00,884 --> 01:11:02,427
I didn't mean anything.

1082
01:11:02,553 --> 01:11:03,929
Come on, Stan.

1083
01:11:04,054 --> 01:11:05,930
See you Monday, Harry.

1084
01:11:06,056 --> 01:11:09,017
You want us to
put the lights out?

1085
01:11:28,037 --> 01:11:28,912
Night, Harry!

1086
01:11:29,038 --> 01:11:31,415
Yeah. Goodnight, Harry.

1087
01:11:36,378 --> 01:11:37,754
What do you think?

1088
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,757
I don't know what
I'm going to get him...

1089
01:11:40,883 --> 01:11:41,925
for Christmas yet.

1090
01:11:42,051 --> 01:11:43,427
He's already got everything.

1091
01:11:49,558 --> 01:11:53,436
Harry, are you going to give me
a hard time tonight?

1092
01:11:53,562 --> 01:11:55,021
# When the red,
red robin #

1093
01:11:55,147 --> 01:11:56,523
Harry!

1094
01:11:56,648 --> 01:11:57,940
Harry!

1095
01:11:58,067 --> 01:11:59,443
Come on. Come back.

1096
01:11:59,568 --> 01:12:01,444
Turn it off.

1097
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:03,446
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

1098
01:12:03,572 --> 01:12:04,614
# When the red, red robin #

1099
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:10,287
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

1100
01:12:11,914 --> 01:12:14,958
# Wake up, wake up,
you sleepyhead #

1101
01:12:15,084 --> 01:12:16,627
She's frightened.

1102
01:12:16,752 --> 01:12:18,462
This is where she's frightened.

1103
01:12:18,587 --> 01:12:20,964
I don't know what
I'm going to get him...

1104
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:22,466
for Christmas yet.

1105
01:12:22,591 --> 01:12:24,134
This is no ordinary conversation.

1106
01:12:24,259 --> 01:12:26,135
He doesn't need anything any more.

1107
01:12:26,261 --> 01:12:27,887
It makes me feel...

1108
01:12:28,013 --> 01:12:31,891
I haven't decided
what I'm going to get you yet.

1109
01:12:32,017 --> 01:12:32,892
Something.

1110
01:12:33,018 --> 01:12:34,394
Forget it, Harry.

1111
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:35,896
It's only a trick.

1112
01:12:36,021 --> 01:12:37,397
What?

1113
01:12:37,523 --> 01:12:38,440
A job.

1114
01:12:38,565 --> 01:12:40,900
You're not supposed
to feel anything.

1115
01:12:41,026 --> 01:12:43,403
You're just supposed to do it.

1116
01:12:43,529 --> 01:12:44,905
That's all.

1117
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:45,905
Relax, honey.

1118
01:12:46,031 --> 01:12:48,408
A lot of fun you are.

1119
01:12:48,534 --> 01:12:49,910
You're supposed to tease me...

1120
01:12:50,035 --> 01:12:51,911
give me hints, make me guess.

1121
01:12:52,037 --> 01:12:52,912
You know.

1122
01:12:54,039 --> 01:12:55,415
Does it bother you?

1123
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:56,416
What?

1124
01:12:56,542 --> 01:12:58,418
Walking around in circles.

1125
01:13:01,046 --> 01:13:04,924
Oh, look, that's terrible.

1126
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,926
He's not hurting anyone.

1127
01:13:10,556 --> 01:13:11,932
Neither are we.

1128
01:13:15,561 --> 01:13:16,436
Oh, God.

1129
01:13:16,562 --> 01:13:17,437
"Oh, God."

1130
01:13:17,563 --> 01:13:20,941
Listen to the way
she says "Oh, God."

1131
01:13:23,068 --> 01:13:24,110
Come here.

1132
01:13:24,236 --> 01:13:26,863
Every time I see
one of those old guys...

1133
01:13:26,989 --> 01:13:29,866
I always think the same thing.

1134
01:13:29,992 --> 01:13:31,868
What do you think?

1135
01:13:31,994 --> 01:13:33,370
I always think...

1136
01:13:33,495 --> 01:13:36,414
that he was once
somebody's baby boy.

1137
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,168
Really. I... I do.

1138
01:13:40,294 --> 01:13:43,171
I think he was once
somebody's baby boy...

1139
01:13:43,297 --> 01:13:47,175
and he had a mother
and a father who loved him.

1140
01:13:47,301 --> 01:13:51,179
And now there he is,
half dead on a park bench...

1141
01:13:51,305 --> 01:13:53,682
and where are his
mother or his father...

1142
01:13:53,807 --> 01:13:55,683
all his uncles now?

1143
01:13:55,809 --> 01:13:58,186
Anyway, that's what
I always think.

1144
01:14:00,522 --> 01:14:01,898
I always think...

1145
01:14:02,024 --> 01:14:04,401
how, when they had
the newspaper strike...

1146
01:14:04,526 --> 01:14:05,401
in New York...

1147
01:14:05,527 --> 01:14:07,403
more of those old guys died.

1148
01:14:07,529 --> 01:14:09,906
50 of them froze
to death in one night.

1149
01:14:10,032 --> 01:14:12,409
Just because there were
no newspapers?

1150
01:14:12,534 --> 01:14:14,911
Really. Keeps them warm.

1151
01:14:15,037 --> 01:14:16,955
Well, that's terrible.

1152
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:20,667
Who started this
conversation, anyhow?

1153
01:14:23,045 --> 01:14:24,421
You did.

1154
01:14:24,546 --> 01:14:25,922
Did not.

1155
01:14:26,048 --> 01:14:27,382
Yes, you did.

1156
01:14:27,508 --> 01:14:29,510
You just don't remember it.

1157
01:14:31,011 --> 01:14:33,888
Pretend like I just
told you a joke.

1158
01:14:37,518 --> 01:14:39,394
Where did you hear that?

1159
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,896
That's my secret.

1160
01:14:42,523 --> 01:14:45,400
Later in the week.

1161
01:14:45,526 --> 01:14:46,401
Sunday, maybe.

1162
01:14:48,529 --> 01:14:50,405
Sunday, definitely.

1163
01:14:52,533 --> 01:14:54,409
The Jack Tar Hotel.

1164
01:14:56,537 --> 01:14:58,914
3:00. Room 773.

1165
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:01,332
Look, Mark. Do you see him?

1166
01:15:01,458 --> 01:15:03,334
The man with the hearing aid
like Charles.

1167
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:04,669
No. Where?

1168
01:15:04,795 --> 01:15:07,672
Right there,
with the shopping bag.

1169
01:15:07,798 --> 01:15:09,674
He's been following us
all around...

1170
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,927
and he's following us close.

1171
01:15:12,052 --> 01:15:14,929
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

1172
01:15:17,558 --> 01:15:19,434
# When the red, red robin #

1173
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:22,437
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

1174
01:15:22,563 --> 01:15:23,438
# Along #

1175
01:15:23,564 --> 01:15:24,439
Angel...

1176
01:15:26,066 --> 01:15:27,859
God, it will be so good...

1177
01:15:27,985 --> 01:15:30,862
to be finished with all this.

1178
01:15:30,988 --> 01:15:32,406
I love you.

1179
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:34,866
It's all right, baby.

1180
01:15:34,992 --> 01:15:36,326
It's all right.

1181
01:15:36,452 --> 01:15:38,328
We're spending too much
time together here.

1182
01:15:38,454 --> 01:15:41,331
No. Let's stay
just a little longer.

1183
01:15:45,085 --> 01:15:46,419
"Kill us."

1184
01:15:47,504 --> 01:15:50,381
He'd kill them
if he had a chance.

1185
01:15:50,507 --> 01:15:53,009
He'd kill us if he got the chance.

1186
01:15:53,135 --> 01:15:55,011
Oh, God. What have I done?

1187
01:15:55,137 --> 01:15:58,014
I have to destroy the tapes.

1188
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:01,017
I can't let it happen again.

1189
01:16:01,143 --> 01:16:04,020
I better get back.
It's almost 2:00.

1190
01:16:04,146 --> 01:16:05,397
Oh, please, don't go.

1191
01:16:05,522 --> 01:16:08,608
A family was murdered
because of me.

1192
01:16:10,027 --> 01:16:10,944
I know.

1193
01:16:12,029 --> 01:16:13,405
I know, Harry.

1194
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:14,948
Everything will turn out.

1195
01:16:16,533 --> 01:16:19,410
Oh, God. There's no protection.

1196
01:16:19,536 --> 01:16:21,913
I follow them
wherever they're going.

1197
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:23,415
And I can hear them.

1198
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:24,749
Bye-bye.

1199
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:26,877
Oh, wait, you have
something in your eye.

1200
01:16:27,002 --> 01:16:27,877
Yeah?

1201
01:16:28,003 --> 01:16:29,379
You really don't.

1202
01:16:29,505 --> 01:16:31,882
I just wanted to kiss you.

1203
01:16:32,007 --> 01:16:33,383
I forgive you.

1204
01:16:33,509 --> 01:16:34,885
I forgive you, darling.

1205
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:37,345
I forgive you.

1206
01:18:07,436 --> 01:18:08,311
Listen.

1207
01:18:08,437 --> 01:18:11,189
Listen. My name is Harry Caul.

1208
01:18:13,108 --> 01:18:14,651
Can you hear me?

1209
01:18:16,612 --> 01:18:18,655
Don't be afraid.

1210
01:18:18,781 --> 01:18:22,659
I... I know you don't
know who I am...

1211
01:18:22,785 --> 01:18:24,161
but I know you.

1212
01:18:25,788 --> 01:18:28,415
There isn't much
to say about myself.

1213
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:29,415
I...

1214
01:18:39,551 --> 01:18:41,719
Sick when I was a boy.

1215
01:18:43,055 --> 01:18:46,433
I was very sick
when I was a boy.

1216
01:18:46,558 --> 01:18:50,436
I was paralyzed in my left arm
and my left leg.

1217
01:18:50,562 --> 01:18:52,272
I couldn't walk for six months.

1218
01:18:52,398 --> 01:18:55,776
One doctor said that
I'd probably never walk again.

1219
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:00,280
My mother...

1220
01:19:00,406 --> 01:19:03,283
My mother used to
lower me into a hot bath.

1221
01:19:03,409 --> 01:19:05,285
It was therapy.

1222
01:19:06,912 --> 01:19:08,121
One time the doorbell rang...

1223
01:19:08,247 --> 01:19:10,624
and she went down to answer it.

1224
01:19:10,749 --> 01:19:11,958
I started sliding down.

1225
01:19:12,084 --> 01:19:13,460
I could feel the water.

1226
01:19:13,585 --> 01:19:16,462
It started coming up
to my chin, to my nose.

1227
01:19:16,588 --> 01:19:17,964
When I woke up...

1228
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:20,967
my body was all greasy
from the holy oil...

1229
01:19:21,093 --> 01:19:22,969
she put on my body.

1230
01:19:23,095 --> 01:19:25,472
I remember being
disappointed I survived.

1231
01:19:25,597 --> 01:19:26,806
When I was 5...

1232
01:19:26,932 --> 01:19:29,726
my... my father introduced me
to a friend of his.

1233
01:19:29,852 --> 01:19:32,729
For no reason,
I hit him in the stomach.

1234
01:19:32,855 --> 01:19:34,731
He died a year later.

1235
01:19:35,899 --> 01:19:38,776
He'll kill you
if he gets a chance.

1236
01:19:42,031 --> 01:19:44,700
I'm not afraid of death.

1237
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,833
I am afraid of murder.

1238
01:20:52,059 --> 01:20:52,934
Meredith?

1239
01:20:57,564 --> 01:20:58,439
Hey.

1240
01:21:43,318 --> 01:21:44,193
Bitch.

1241
01:22:01,545 --> 01:22:03,922
Good morning. May I help you?

1242
01:22:04,048 --> 01:22:05,424
Yes. Extension 765, please.

1243
01:22:05,549 --> 01:22:06,967
One moment, please.

1244
01:22:08,552 --> 01:22:09,803
Director's office.

1245
01:22:09,928 --> 01:22:13,264
I'd like to speak to
the director's assistant, please.

1246
01:22:13,390 --> 01:22:15,433
Mr Stett. Uh, Mr Martin Stett.

1247
01:22:15,559 --> 01:22:17,435
Mr Caul is on the line.

1248
01:22:17,561 --> 01:22:18,979
One moment, please.

1249
01:22:22,066 --> 01:22:23,942
I'm sorry. That's impossible now.

1250
01:22:24,068 --> 01:22:25,944
Can we get back to you?

1251
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:28,405
No, I... I... I have
to talk to him.

1252
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:30,406
Can we have your name again?

1253
01:22:30,532 --> 01:22:31,407
Caul.

1254
01:22:31,533 --> 01:22:33,910
Would you mind spelling that?

1255
01:22:34,036 --> 01:22:36,413
C-A-U-L. Caul.

1256
01:22:36,538 --> 01:22:38,414
I'm putting you on hold.

1257
01:22:42,044 --> 01:22:44,421
Mr Caul, we'll get
right back to you.

1258
01:22:44,546 --> 01:22:46,923
No. You don't have
my telephone number.

1259
01:22:47,049 --> 01:22:47,924
Hello?

1260
01:23:42,021 --> 01:23:42,896
Yes?

1261
01:23:43,022 --> 01:23:44,898
Mr Caul? This is Martin Stett.

1262
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,900
How did you get this number?

1263
01:23:47,026 --> 01:23:48,902
We prepare dossiers
on everyone...

1264
01:23:49,028 --> 01:23:51,405
who comes in contact
with the director.

1265
01:23:51,530 --> 01:23:53,907
You know that means
we've been watching you.

1266
01:23:54,033 --> 01:23:55,409
We have the tapes.

1267
01:23:55,534 --> 01:23:56,910
They're perfectly safe.

1268
01:23:57,036 --> 01:24:00,914
The director was anxious
to hear them as soon as possible.

1269
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,417
You seemed to be...
I don't know... disturbed.

1270
01:24:03,542 --> 01:24:06,419
I couldn't risk
you destroying our tapes.

1271
01:24:06,545 --> 01:24:08,922
You understand,
don't you, Mr Caul?

1272
01:24:09,048 --> 01:24:12,760
Our tapes have nothing
to do with you.

1273
01:24:12,885 --> 01:24:14,761
Why don't you come over now...

1274
01:24:14,887 --> 01:24:16,263
and bring the photographs?

1275
01:24:16,388 --> 01:24:17,680
The director's here...

1276
01:24:17,806 --> 01:24:20,183
and he's prepared
to pay you in full.

1277
01:25:41,098 --> 01:25:44,476
Every time I see
one of those old guys...

1278
01:25:44,601 --> 01:25:45,977
I think the same thing.

1279
01:25:47,604 --> 01:25:49,480
What do you think?

1280
01:25:49,606 --> 01:25:53,651
I always think that he
was once somebody's baby boy.

1281
01:25:53,777 --> 01:25:57,363
Really. I... I do.

1282
01:25:57,489 --> 01:26:00,158
He was once somebody's
baby boy...

1283
01:26:00,242 --> 01:26:03,787
and he had a mother
and father who loved him...

1284
01:26:03,912 --> 01:26:05,288
and now, there he is...

1285
01:26:05,414 --> 01:26:07,457
half dead on a park bench.

1286
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:09,960
And where are his mother
or his father...

1287
01:26:10,085 --> 01:26:11,586
all his uncles now?

1288
01:26:13,088 --> 01:26:15,882
Anyway, that's what
I always think.

1289
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,136
I always think...

1290
01:26:19,261 --> 01:26:22,138
how, when they had
the newspaper strike in New York...

1291
01:26:22,264 --> 01:26:23,890
more of those old guys died.

1292
01:26:24,016 --> 01:26:26,893
50 of them froze to death
in one night.

1293
01:26:27,019 --> 01:26:29,312
Just because there were
no newspapers?

1294
01:26:29,438 --> 01:26:31,606
Really. Keeps them warm.

1295
01:26:31,732 --> 01:26:33,650
Sounds terrible.

1296
01:26:34,902 --> 01:26:38,238
Who started this
conversation anyhow?

1297
01:26:40,157 --> 01:26:41,116
You did.

1298
01:26:41,241 --> 01:26:43,159
Did not.

1299
01:26:43,285 --> 01:26:46,162
Yes, you did.
You just don't remember it.

1300
01:26:47,456 --> 01:26:50,333
Oh, Mark, it's all right.
We can talk.

1301
01:26:50,459 --> 01:26:52,335
I can't stand it.

1302
01:26:52,461 --> 01:26:54,504
I can't stand it any more.

1303
01:26:54,630 --> 01:26:57,257
You're going to make me cry.

1304
01:26:58,509 --> 01:27:01,386
I know, honey, I know. Me, too.

1305
01:27:01,512 --> 01:27:02,387
No, don't.

1306
01:27:02,513 --> 01:27:03,388
Oh, God.

1307
01:27:03,514 --> 01:27:05,516
You want to hear that again?

1308
01:27:05,641 --> 01:27:08,018
You want it to be true!

1309
01:27:08,143 --> 01:27:09,853
No, I don't.

1310
01:27:09,978 --> 01:27:11,854
I just want you to know...

1311
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,481
whatever you need to know.

1312
01:27:13,607 --> 01:27:14,774
That's all.

1313
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:16,943
Your money's on the table.

1314
01:27:19,029 --> 01:27:21,948
Do you think we can do this?

1315
01:27:23,242 --> 01:27:25,619
I'm tired of drinking anyhow.

1316
01:27:27,079 --> 01:27:29,164
I'm tired of mostly everything.

1317
01:27:29,289 --> 01:27:30,665
Tired of me?

1318
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:32,167
Tired of you...

1319
01:27:32,292 --> 01:27:33,793
but not today.

1320
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:36,671
Later in the week.

1321
01:27:36,797 --> 01:27:39,049
Sunday, maybe.

1322
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:43,720
Sunday, definitely.

1323
01:27:49,018 --> 01:27:51,562
The Jack Tar Hotel.

1324
01:27:51,687 --> 01:27:52,562
3:00.

1325
01:27:52,688 --> 01:27:55,399
Room 773.

1326
01:27:55,524 --> 01:27:57,901
Look, Mark, do you see him...

1327
01:27:58,027 --> 01:28:00,404
the man with the hearing aid
like Charles?

1328
01:28:00,529 --> 01:28:01,488
No. Where?

1329
01:28:01,613 --> 01:28:04,741
Right there, with
the shopping bag.

1330
01:28:04,867 --> 01:28:07,035
Please count your money outside.

1331
01:28:07,161 --> 01:28:09,538
He's been following us all around.

1332
01:28:09,663 --> 01:28:11,956
He was following us close.

1333
01:28:12,082 --> 01:28:14,667
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

1334
01:28:20,215 --> 01:28:21,799
# When the red, red robin #

1335
01:28:21,925 --> 01:28:25,470
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

1336
01:28:25,596 --> 01:28:26,680
# Along #

1337
01:28:28,891 --> 01:28:31,268
God, it will be so good...

1338
01:28:31,393 --> 01:28:33,770
to be finished with all this.

1339
01:28:36,398 --> 01:28:37,816
I love you.

1340
01:28:41,153 --> 01:28:44,030
These are the pictures
you asked for.

1341
01:28:44,156 --> 01:28:46,575
We're spending
too much time together here.

1342
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:49,077
No. Let's stay
just a little longer.

1343
01:28:49,203 --> 01:28:51,288
What will you do to her?

1344
01:28:51,413 --> 01:28:53,957
...kill us if he got the chance.

1345
01:28:56,919 --> 01:28:59,838
I think he's been
recording my telephone.

1346
01:29:01,924 --> 01:29:04,843
Listen, I'd better get back.
It's almost 2:00.

1347
01:29:04,968 --> 01:29:06,844
No, please don't go back there.

1348
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:08,763
Not just yet.

1349
01:29:08,889 --> 01:29:13,143
All right.
All right, honey. I won't.

1350
01:29:17,272 --> 01:29:18,648
15.000 bucks.

1351
01:29:18,774 --> 01:29:23,028
That's not bad for a day's work,
is it, Mr Caul?

1352
01:29:23,153 --> 01:29:25,238
What'll he do with them?

1353
01:29:27,658 --> 01:29:28,700
We'll see.

1354
01:29:37,876 --> 01:29:41,713
...kill us if he got the chance.

1355
01:29:41,839 --> 01:29:43,882
# When the red, red robin #

1356
01:29:44,008 --> 01:29:47,428
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

1357
01:29:47,553 --> 01:29:48,720
# Along #

1358
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:56,019
Later in the week.
Sunday, maybe.

1359
01:29:58,772 --> 01:30:00,648
Sunday, definitely.

1360
01:30:03,944 --> 01:30:05,612
The Jack Tar Hotel.

1361
01:30:07,156 --> 01:30:09,158
3:00.

1362
01:30:09,283 --> 01:30:11,285
Room 773.

1363
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:14,537
Uh...

1364
01:30:14,663 --> 01:30:18,458
I wonder if you could give me
room 773.

1365
01:30:18,584 --> 01:30:20,627
773?

1366
01:30:22,004 --> 01:30:23,964
That is occupied, sir.

1367
01:30:27,343 --> 01:30:30,220
The rooms are all
basically the same, however.

1368
01:30:30,346 --> 01:30:31,305
Well...

1369
01:30:34,558 --> 01:30:37,435
Do you have a room
that would be, uh...

1370
01:30:37,561 --> 01:30:38,937
adjoining, uh... close by?

1371
01:30:39,063 --> 01:30:40,731
Adjoining, just...

1372
01:30:40,856 --> 01:30:42,607
Yes, I do.

1373
01:30:42,733 --> 01:30:43,650
You do.

1374
01:34:54,735 --> 01:34:57,571
I'm tired of this lying,
all right?

1375
01:35:07,623 --> 01:35:09,666
I can't stand it.

1376
01:35:09,792 --> 01:35:12,085
I can't stand it any more.

1377
01:35:12,211 --> 01:35:14,588
You're going to make me cry.

1378
01:35:14,713 --> 01:35:17,465
I know. Me, too.

1379
01:35:17,591 --> 01:35:18,842
No, don't.

1380
01:35:18,967 --> 01:35:20,969
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1381
01:35:21,095 --> 01:35:22,679
No idea!

1382
01:35:22,805 --> 01:35:24,681
This is horrible...

1383
01:35:28,018 --> 01:35:29,394
I love you.

1384
01:36:21,155 --> 01:36:24,616
Aah!

1385
01:36:26,493 --> 01:36:29,329
Aah!

1386
01:36:36,045 --> 01:36:38,380
It was stated that Nixon
would not deliver...

1387
01:36:38,505 --> 01:36:41,299
the State of the Union
message in person...

1388
01:36:52,227 --> 01:36:54,479
Will you cut that out?

1389
01:36:54,605 --> 01:36:57,482
How can you yell
at me like that?

1390
01:36:57,608 --> 01:36:58,984
And in my condition.

1391
01:36:59,109 --> 01:37:02,487
You're not fit to be
the father of my child.

1392
01:37:02,613 --> 01:37:03,989
Oh, what is this?

1393
01:37:04,114 --> 01:37:05,990
I'm trying to act like Wilma.

1394
01:37:06,116 --> 01:37:07,784
Well, you're overdoing it.

1395
01:37:12,122 --> 01:37:13,873
All right. Pull over.

1396
01:37:16,085 --> 01:37:17,586
What's the big rush?

1397
01:37:17,711 --> 01:37:19,921
I'm taking my wife
to the hospital.

1398
01:37:20,047 --> 01:37:21,423
She's having a baby.

1399
01:37:21,548 --> 01:37:23,258
I got to hand it to you.

1400
01:37:23,384 --> 01:37:24,676
You got intestinal fortitude.

1401
01:37:24,802 --> 01:37:25,803
Sit down, Fred.

1402
01:37:25,928 --> 01:37:29,681
You're wearing a groove
in the floor.

1403
01:37:29,807 --> 01:37:31,183
Look at Wilma out there.

1404
01:37:31,308 --> 01:37:33,184
How can she be so calm...

1405
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:36,187
when she knows
what I'm going through?

1406
01:37:36,313 --> 01:37:37,689
How are you, Fred?

1407
01:37:37,815 --> 01:37:40,192
How do you think I am?

1408
01:37:40,317 --> 01:37:42,193
Betty, you go out there...

1409
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:44,571
and tell Wilma if she doesn't...

1410
01:42:04,039 --> 01:42:05,123
Wait. Richard!

1411
01:42:05,207 --> 01:42:07,000
I want to see the director.

1412
01:42:07,126 --> 01:42:08,710
He's not in today.

1413
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,339
I'm afraid you'll
have to leave now.

1414
01:44:10,958 --> 01:44:12,334
Let's clear an aisle.

1415
01:44:12,459 --> 01:44:13,835
Let these people through.

1416
01:44:13,961 --> 01:44:15,337
Come on, clear the way.

1417
01:44:15,462 --> 01:44:16,838
We'll answer your
questions upstairs.

1418
01:44:16,964 --> 01:44:18,340
Let these people through.

1419
01:44:18,465 --> 01:44:19,966
Let these people through.

1420
01:44:20,092 --> 01:44:21,384
Just one question.

1421
01:44:21,510 --> 01:44:22,511
No, please.

1422
01:44:22,636 --> 01:44:25,263
Do you suspect foul play
in the accident?

1423
01:44:25,389 --> 01:44:27,224
What about your
corporate control?

1424
01:44:27,349 --> 01:44:29,225
Will your stock now give you...

1425
01:44:29,351 --> 01:44:30,226
controlling interest?

1426
01:44:30,352 --> 01:44:32,979
What kind of insurance
do you have?

1427
01:44:33,105 --> 01:44:34,314
That's an unfair question.

1428
01:44:39,111 --> 01:44:40,987
What do you think?

1429
01:44:41,113 --> 01:44:43,990
I don't know what
I'm getting him for Christmas.

1430
01:44:44,116 --> 01:44:46,493
He's already got everything.

1431
01:44:46,618 --> 01:44:49,579
Doesn't need anything any more.

1432
01:44:52,458 --> 01:44:55,502
Do you feel there's an enemy
within the company?

1433
01:44:58,339 --> 01:45:00,215
He's not hurting anybody.

1434
01:45:00,341 --> 01:45:03,010
Neither are we.

1435
01:45:03,135 --> 01:45:05,470
Oh, God.

1436
01:45:05,596 --> 01:45:06,471
...drunk driving?

1437
01:45:11,226 --> 01:45:12,518
I can't stand it.

1438
01:45:12,644 --> 01:45:15,688
I can't stand it any more.

1439
01:45:15,814 --> 01:45:16,898
Aah!

1440
01:45:19,026 --> 01:45:19,985
Take it!

1441
01:45:20,110 --> 01:45:21,778
Take it!

1442
01:45:26,909 --> 01:45:29,244
Do you think we can do this?

1443
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:31,288
Later in the week.

1444
01:45:31,413 --> 01:45:34,249
Sunday, maybe.

1445
01:45:34,375 --> 01:45:37,252
Sunday, definitely.

1446
01:45:37,378 --> 01:45:39,171
The Jack Tar Hotel.

1447
01:45:40,506 --> 01:45:41,381
3:00.

1448
01:45:41,507 --> 01:45:43,550
Room 773.

1449
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:49,889
He'd kill us if he got the chance.

1450
01:46:23,173 --> 01:46:24,424
Hello.

1451
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:27,427
Hello.

1452
01:47:21,231 --> 01:47:22,565
Hello.

1453
01:47:30,115 --> 01:47:31,241
Hello.

1454
01:47:31,367 --> 01:47:34,078
We know that you know, Mr Caul.

1455
01:47:34,203 --> 01:47:37,080
For your own sake,
don't get involved any further.

1456
01:47:37,206 --> 01:47:39,082
We'll be listening to you.
