1
00:01:08,632 --> 00:01:10,717
This is car 2118.
Call Greenpoint Hospital.

2
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:12,719
We're bringing in a wounded cop.

3
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:15,639
All right, 10-4.

4
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:26,817
8th Precinct.

5
00:01:30,237 --> 00:01:32,447
Jesus Christ.

6
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,209
Guess who got shot.

7
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:47,963
Serpico.

8
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:52,718
You think a cop did it?

9
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,928
I know six cops
said they'd like to.

10
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:12,905
Hello.

11
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,867
New York Times.
Serpico's been shot.

12
00:02:18,243 --> 00:02:19,745
Oh, my God!

13
00:02:19,828 --> 00:02:21,914
- They're taking him to Greenpoint.
- I'll see you there.

14
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,838
To be a police officer
means to believe in the law...

15
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:55,382
and to enforce it impartially...

16
00:03:55,465 --> 00:03:57,551
respecting the equality
of all men...

17
00:03:57,634 --> 00:04:00,721
and the dignity and worth
of every individual.

18
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:05,559
Every day, your life
will be on the line...

19
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:07,978
and also your character.

20
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,607
You'll need integrity,
courage, honesty...

21
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,776
compassion, courtesy...

22
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:16,612
and perseverance...

23
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:18,780
and patience.

24
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:23,410
You men are now prepared
to join the war against crime...

25
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:27,289
and put the theory you have learned
into practice in the streets.

26
00:04:36,715 --> 00:04:38,800
Same time, same place.
Both reports.

27
00:04:38,884 --> 00:04:41,762
I already made out a 424.

28
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:44,348
- You covering this, Lieutenant?
- Yes, Chief Green.

29
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:46,433
Who was with Serpico?

30
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:49,895
- Heinemann and Julio.
- I want them interrogated.

31
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:52,689
I want this conducted as an official
departmental investigation.

32
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:55,108
Transcripts by 9:00 a.m.

33
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:09,248
Another thing. I want 
a 24-hour guard on Serpico.

34
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:11,583
- Yes, sir.
- You two, over there.

35
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,686
Anthony Sardo.

36
00:06:16,315 --> 00:06:18,233
Ralph Seidler.

37
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:24,865
Frank Serpico.

38
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,507
Come on.
Marianne wants a good shot.

39
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:45,135
Get closer!

40
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:14,540
Patrolman Serpico.

41
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,252
Upstairs.
See the roll-call man.

42
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:36,645
Memorize your posts and sectors.
This week you're 8:00 to 4:00.

43
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:39,148
Next week, 4:00 to midnight.
Grab a locker.

44
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:42,317
Any questions, older guys will
fill you in. Good luck.

45
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:07,301
Yo! 8:00.
Let's go! Come on!

46
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:09,928
Gather around. Let's go.

47
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,972
All right. Settle down.

48
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:18,645
All right. Just a few announcements
today and two new men.

49
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,399
On the board on my left,
you see squad one, blue sector...

50
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:24,651
squad two, red sector...

51
00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:26,653
squad three, green sector.

52
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:31,033
Now, we want summonses,
summonses, summonses.

53
00:08:31,116 --> 00:08:32,868
I'll help the boys, Florence.

54
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:35,204
- This is Frank Serpico, Charlie.
- Hello, Frank.

55
00:08:35,287 --> 00:08:37,498
- Hello, Charlie.
- How about some creamed chicken?

56
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,417
- Sounds good to me.
- No, I think I'll have...

57
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:43,337
How about a roast beef on roll?

58
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:50,511
Yeah, okay. You go through
the line. I'll bring it over.

59
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,558
Peluce, it's all fat here.

60
00:09:00,354 --> 00:09:02,815
- I saw real lean beef over there.
- Take it easy.

61
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:05,359
Sit down, sit down.

62
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,987
- What's the matter?
- Don't be so fussy. It's free.

63
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:11,907
Well, I'm not fussy.
I don't know how I'm gonna eat this.

64
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,452
Charlie's okay. We give him a break
on double parking on deliveries.

65
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,711
Couldn't I pay for it,
get what I want?

66
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:27,506
Frank, generally, you just sort of
take what Charlie gives you.

67
00:09:36,306 --> 00:09:39,643
Sector D-David, 1034,
possible rape in progress...

68
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:44,106
vicinity of PS 218,
Grand Avenue and BQ Expressway.

69
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,819
Becker, aren't
we gonna take that?

70
00:09:48,902 --> 00:09:51,488
Relax, Frank.
It's not our sector.

71
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:55,784
It's on the borderline.

72
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,537
I'm gonna take it.

73
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,290
D sector, 1547, 10-4.

74
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:34,490
Oh, my God!

75
00:10:38,952 --> 00:10:41,663
Hold it! Hold it!
Police officers!

76
00:10:41,747 --> 00:10:44,208
Oh, shit!

77
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:46,502
- Come on. Give us
- Don't shoot now.

78
00:10:46,543 --> 00:10:48,045
Be cool.

79
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:50,631
All right. Okay.
Put your guns away.

80
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:53,050
Put your guns away, man.
Come on. Goddamn it!

81
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:55,886
I said put them
motherfucking guns away!

82
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:58,055
I'll cut her, goddamn it.

83
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:03,352
Turn the motherfucking
light out, man.

84
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:05,979
I'll cut her, man.
I'll cut her.

85
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:09,191
Now, you just be cool,
goddamn it.

86
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:11,360
Just be cool. All right.

87
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:14,196
All right. All right.
That's it.

88
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:41,557
The other one took his thing out.

89
00:11:44,768 --> 00:11:46,854
He put it up to my mouth.

90
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:51,066
He... He held me down.

91
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:55,863
They said if I didn't do it...

92
00:11:56,947 --> 00:11:58,907
they'd kill me.

93
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:06,832
She's gonna make
a hell of a witness.

94
00:12:06,915 --> 00:12:09,001
Would you like a stretcher?

95
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,933
Muscles, he's all yours.
I'll call you from the hospital.

96
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,981
Okay, hard-on.

97
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:16,276
Who were your playmates?

98
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:24,117
Hey, Frank, you want
a piece of this?

99
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:26,787
No. I'm gonna fill out
the arrest card.

100
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:52,020
Hey, Charlie, let me have
five minutes with him.

101
00:13:52,104 --> 00:13:54,022
- Sure.
- Thanks.

102
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:00,904
Thank you, Charlie.

103
00:14:08,912 --> 00:14:12,291
That prick really worked you over.
How do you feel?

104
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:15,002
How come you didn't
stay for the fun?

105
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:17,171
That's not my kind of fun.

106
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:20,507
Shit.

107
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:25,179
I want to talk to you.

108
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:28,765
I want to take you across the
street, get you a cup of coffee...

109
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:30,476
without cuffs.

110
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,690
Now, look. I didn't touch you
upstairs, right?

111
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:39,818
You take off on me,
I'll put one in your back.

112
00:14:39,902 --> 00:14:41,320
Understand?

113
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:45,032
Come on.

114
00:14:48,994 --> 00:14:52,539
It's a goddamn shame you gotta take
this whole rap yourself.

115
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:57,878
I don't know. Maybe you're guilty,
maybe you're not.

116
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:02,382
Maybe you just
went along for the ride.

117
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:04,718
I got a feeling
you just went along.

118
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:09,264
But you're the one
who got caught.

119
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:11,642
You never even
got your cock out.

120
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:14,561
- Put it in the report.
- It's in the report.

121
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,278
Look at you.

122
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,031
- I can't eat.
- No, you can't.

123
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:31,745
I don't understand you,
you know that?

124
00:15:31,787 --> 00:15:33,914
What are you,
obligated to those guys?

125
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:36,959
Fuck it.
They left you holding the bag.

126
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,086
You don't owe them nothin'.

127
00:15:41,463 --> 00:15:44,591
They're gonna put you away,
you know that?

128
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:46,635
What can I get?

129
00:15:49,054 --> 00:15:51,473
Oh, let's see...
Kidnapping...

130
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:53,684
Sodomy, rape...

131
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:57,062
Are you kidding me?

132
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:06,405
You talk to me.
Save yourself.

133
00:16:10,951 --> 00:16:12,244
Let it go, Harv!

134
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:24,840
Take the shot.

135
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:27,092
You not gonna send someone over?
Look, look.

136
00:16:27,176 --> 00:16:29,469
McCoy, I get one,
I'm gonna lose the other.

137
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:33,724
Look, Serpico, that's Muscles' case.
He's off for a couple days.

138
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:36,685
- I can't cut in, Frank.
- They're here now!

139
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:38,687
- It'll keep.
- No, it won't!

140
00:17:06,256 --> 00:17:08,258
Police officer!
Hold it! Hold it!

141
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,677
Turn around. Turn around.

142
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:15,849
Spread!

143
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:19,895
Come on, man. Come on.
Please take that gun from my head.

144
00:17:19,978 --> 00:17:21,897
Turn around slow.

145
00:17:35,494 --> 00:17:38,455
We'll take it from here, kid.
You don't have to hang around.

146
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,378
What are you talking about?
That's my collar.

147
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:48,298
We take the collar.

148
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:51,677
A collar like this, don't look good,
a patrolman takes it.

149
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,096
Wait a minute.
I don't care how it looks.

150
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:58,225
Now, I did the work. I broke my ass
on this. It's my collar.

151
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:01,645
You really want the collar, kid?
You can be brought up on charges.

152
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:06,400
Left your post, the street, entered
the school yard without permission...

153
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:09,444
That's just for openers.
Right, Penella?

154
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:14,324
No memo entry. Shit. You'll be lucky
to end up with a reprimand.

155
00:18:14,408 --> 00:18:16,994
We'll give you an assist
on the arrest, kid.

156
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,002
Come on, Frankie!

157
00:18:25,043 --> 00:18:28,505
Jim, get out of the way!
What are you doing?

158
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,135
What you want me to do?
Go across the street?

159
00:18:50,486 --> 00:18:53,489
- Hey, Frank.
- Hi, Uncle Will. How you doing?

160
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,622
- Hey, Pasquale.
- Hey, Frankie! How you doing?

161
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,832
Okay. How you doing?
Where's Pop?

162
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,877
Be back in a half hour.
How's it going, Frankie?

163
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,129
Okay.
I come to get my shoes.

164
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:11,548
Rev it up. Rev it up!

165
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:16,512
- Here they are.
- Frankie, how you doing?

166
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:18,514
Okay. Good job.

167
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:20,557
You people do good work here.

168
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:24,895
So, how you doing, Frankie?

169
00:19:24,978 --> 00:19:28,232
You keep asking me that. What's
the matter with you? I'm doing okay!

170
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:32,277
Well, I thought you were coming over
to the house Saturday night.

171
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:34,446
I'm sorry, Pasquale.
I couldn't make it.

172
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,158
Margaret invited Marianne over.
Marianne was very disappointed...

173
00:19:38,242 --> 00:19:42,162
Now, look. I don't like that.
I mean, really.

174
00:19:42,204 --> 00:19:45,916
Don't invite people over
if you're not sure I'm gonna come.

175
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:48,752
I mean it, now. If I want to
see Marianne, I'll call her.

176
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:52,047
What's going on
with you two anyway?

177
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,467
Hey, Pasquale,
I'm gonna tell you something.

178
00:19:56,802 --> 00:20:00,013
See, all day long,
I work with cops. Right?

179
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:02,641
Now, when I go out,
I see Marianne...

180
00:20:02,724 --> 00:20:06,812
her father's a cop, her brother's
a cop, her uncle's a cop.

181
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:09,940
- I got a feeling she's a cop too.
- Come here!

182
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:15,404
- How you doing on the job?
- It's got its problems.

183
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,866
Mama tells me that you're looking
for a new apartment. Is that true?

184
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:21,201
- Yeah.
- So, where are you going?

185
00:20:22,536 --> 00:20:24,872
I don't know.
I'm looking around by school.

186
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:26,874
NYU? Greenwich Village?

187
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:29,126
- Yeah, Greenwich Village.
- What's the matter?

188
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:31,378
The old neighborhood's
not good enough for ya?

189
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:33,255
Tell Pop I was here.

190
00:20:33,338 --> 00:20:35,215
Frankie, Sunday?

191
00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:37,801
Sunday what?

192
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:40,012
Dinner? Huh?

193
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:44,308
- Do me one favor- no Marianne.
- I know. No Marianne.

194
00:20:44,391 --> 00:20:46,477
All right.
A couple of announcements.

195
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:48,812
"Announcing a course in
fingerprint identification...

196
00:20:48,896 --> 00:20:50,981
to be given at John Jay College.

197
00:20:51,064 --> 00:20:53,150
This course will be available
to those patrolmen...

198
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:55,319
who wish to make themselves
eligible for assignment...

199
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:58,572
to the Bureau of
Criminal Identification, BCI...

200
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:02,034
which is generally considered to be
a path to a detective's gold shield.

201
00:21:02,117 --> 00:21:04,953
Signed, Captain McGuire."

202
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:07,206
On the board on my left,
you see squad one...

203
00:21:10,918 --> 00:21:12,377
Hot enough for ya?

204
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,172
It's not the heat.
It's the humidity.

205
00:21:15,255 --> 00:21:17,508
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

206
00:21:37,903 --> 00:21:40,572
You know how long
you're taking on that one?

207
00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:44,034
Check one print category, two-
That's plenty.

208
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:49,748
I'm not gonna give a guy a
"no record" when he might have one.

209
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,877
How long you been
with the BCI now, Serpico?

210
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,505
All my life.

211
00:21:56,588 --> 00:21:59,800
That's long enough to know
how we do things.

212
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:03,303
Barto, it's not just that.

213
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:06,140
You don't like me.

214
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:08,767
BCI never had
a weirdo cop before.

215
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:12,229
Barto, stop buggin' me.

216
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:24,074
Mama?

216a
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,500
I just remembered to give you something.

216a
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,500
I did too. 

216b
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,000
What's this?

216c
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,100
Exactly what you're looking that there.

216d
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:53,000
All the money we didn't need we put in the bank for you.

216e
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,100
But why are you doing this?

216f
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:68,500
It's to furnish a home for you. So you remember your mother.

217
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:05,884
Wanna buy a puppy?

218
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:17,104
Look at that, huh?

219
00:24:18,564 --> 00:24:20,649
Where'd you get these dogs?

220
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,819
Oh, they're mine.

221
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:27,030
Want one for free?

222
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:32,619
- I'll pay for it. How much?
- Five dollars.

223
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:36,290
You got it.

224
00:24:41,003 --> 00:24:44,923
Okay, now which one
of you guys wanna come with me?

225
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:46,425
What?

226
00:24:48,302 --> 00:24:50,721
Come on.

227
00:24:50,804 --> 00:24:52,639
- Could you do me a favor?
- What?

228
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:55,726
Just watch the car and my stuff
over here, 'cause I'm movin' in.

229
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:57,728
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

230
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:44,260
Don Quixote, actor or mad man; 
clown or a saint? These are the 
questions that lead us to the 
heart of Cervantes. Cervantes' 
theme. 

231
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:49,530
Seorita Land?

232
00:25:54,868 --> 00:25:56,745
Mr. Serpico.

233
00:25:56,829 --> 00:25:59,706
I got my horse here.
Maybe I could drop you someplace.

234
00:25:59,748 --> 00:26:02,417
Well, I'm going to work
at the Caf Reggio.

235
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:04,419
Caf Reggio.

236
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:11,176
- That's 4th Street and-
- MacDougal and 3rd.

237
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,470
- Can I give you a lift?
- Yeah. Sure.

238
00:26:14,388 --> 00:26:16,431
Jesus, what's that?

239
00:26:16,515 --> 00:26:18,892
You got your hands on
my money belt. Don't do that.

240
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:21,353
That's not a money belt.
That's a gun.

241
00:26:21,436 --> 00:26:24,690
- Well, we gotta eat, don't we?
- Oh, come on!

242
00:26:25,732 --> 00:26:29,027
- What do you need a gun for?
- Ever hear of Barnum and Bailey?

243
00:26:29,111 --> 00:26:31,029
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm their lion tamer.

244
00:26:31,113 --> 00:26:33,031
- Come on.
- That's the truth.

245
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:35,576
- I think you're full of shit.
- You do, huh?

246
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:38,078
- What do you do?
- Me?

247
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:42,416
I'm an actress, a singer,
a dancer and a Buddhist.

248
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:45,377
In that order?

249
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:49,798
- I'm a cop. Would you believe that?
- No, I wouldn't believe it.

250
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:14,990
Those leaps that guy made,
what do you call 'em again?

251
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:16,658
Jets.

252
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:23,957
You try it.

253
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:27,085
All right. How do you start it?
What's your position?

254
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:35,344
Next life. Come on.

255
00:27:38,764 --> 00:27:40,849
What are you reading now,
Serpico?

256
00:27:44,186 --> 00:27:46,522
My Life by Isadora Duncan.

257
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:50,067
She was a ballet dancer.

258
00:27:50,108 --> 00:27:51,401
A belly dancer?

259
00:27:53,028 --> 00:27:57,074
No. No, a ballet dancer.
Ballet.

260
00:27:58,242 --> 00:28:01,286
- You know ballet?
- A little.

261
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,082
- A little bit? You ever see one?
- Not close.

262
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:08,043
I've been to the ballet.
It's terrific.

263
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:10,671
- I've been taking classes.
- Oh, yeah?

264
00:28:10,754 --> 00:28:12,673
That's where I go
after I leave here.

265
00:28:12,756 --> 00:28:15,759
Fantastic for your body.
Really builds you up.

266
00:28:15,843 --> 00:28:18,262
- I can tell.
- You noticed, huh?

267
00:28:18,345 --> 00:28:19,471
I noticed.

268
00:28:19,555 --> 00:28:21,140
There's five positions.

269
00:28:21,223 --> 00:28:23,350
Five pos-
You're being shortchanged.

270
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:26,270
- Oh, no. It's enough. Believe me.
- For what?

271
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:28,897
Watch. See?

272
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:30,566
This is the first position.

273
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:32,901
From this position,
I can do anything.

274
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:34,778
- You want to see?
- Sure.

275
00:28:34,862 --> 00:28:36,780
Here we go.

276
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:42,744
Bye, Barto!

277
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:46,373
- Lieutenant Steiger-
- No, no. Later.

278
00:28:51,378 --> 00:28:55,924
- Hey, turn off the lights.
- Potts, I wanted to read.

279
00:28:57,134 --> 00:28:59,094
Positions, positions!

280
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:02,222
Positions like that you don't see
in a pretzel factory.

281
00:29:02,264 --> 00:29:05,350
Now I gotta do my pee-pee
in the dark.

282
00:29:05,434 --> 00:29:08,562
She's gotta be a nympho
with positions like that.

283
00:29:08,604 --> 00:29:11,607
Hey, Serpico, how can you piss
at a time like this?

284
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,692
Barto wants a specimen.

285
00:29:13,775 --> 00:29:16,069
I'm gonna look into this matter.

286
00:29:20,449 --> 00:29:23,452
- What do you got there?
- Here.

287
00:29:23,535 --> 00:29:25,120
Straight ahead.

288
00:29:26,955 --> 00:29:29,917
- Straight ahead where?
- Third window down.

289
00:29:31,627 --> 00:29:34,463
- I don't see anything over there.
- Let me see.

290
00:29:36,548 --> 00:29:38,926
She just pulled down the shade.

291
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:43,055
- You gotta be some kind of jinx.
- That's right. Blame me.

292
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:48,227
Hold it, Serpico.
What were you two doing?

293
00:29:49,895 --> 00:29:52,105
- What?
- In the shithouse in the dark!

294
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:54,441
Were you goin' down on him?

295
00:29:57,736 --> 00:30:01,156
- What are you talking about?
- You gonna tell me you were peeping?

296
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,159
You were sucking his cock,
weren't you?

297
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:06,662
- What are you, crazy?
- I'll show you fuckin' crazy!

298
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:10,374
Last week I found a pair of shorts
with semen on 'em!

299
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:13,126
There!

300
00:30:15,462 --> 00:30:18,090
You actually accusing me of this?

301
00:30:21,635 --> 00:30:24,429
Good morning, Captain McCIain.
I'm Officer Serpico.

302
00:30:24,513 --> 00:30:26,682
I was told I could
talk to you, sir.

303
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:32,271
Certainly, son.
Come in.

304
00:30:36,441 --> 00:30:38,527
Lieutenant Steiger
won't make a report.

305
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:42,197
He's too concerned with
the image of his department.

306
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:45,576
But it- it could affect
your future in the BCI.

307
00:30:49,163 --> 00:30:51,540
Sir, I tell you...

308
00:30:51,623 --> 00:30:53,876
Frankly,
I don't see any future there.

309
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:58,130
It was bullshit about it being
a path toward being detective...

310
00:30:58,213 --> 00:31:00,382
because I've been there
two years now...

311
00:31:00,465 --> 00:31:02,384
And you want a transfer.

312
00:31:03,135 --> 00:31:06,138
Yes, sir, but I don't wanna
go back to uniform.

313
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:09,933
I'll see what I can do, Frank.

314
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,730
Francis, do you know about my
weekend retreats for Catholic officers?

315
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:21,945
Well, you read that.
It might be of interest to you.

316
00:31:21,987 --> 00:31:23,614
You are Catholic?

317
00:31:24,698 --> 00:31:28,243
- Yeah. I was baptized, yes.
- Good, good.

318
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:32,456
Alfie, come on.

319
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,668
I missed you, baby.

320
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:41,340
She's so crazy, that girl,
I tell you.

321
00:31:41,423 --> 00:31:43,133
Why Paco?

322
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:46,220
All my friends call me Paco.
Could you do me a favor?

323
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:49,640
- Get my keys out of this pocket.
- Sure.

324
00:31:50,307 --> 00:31:53,560
Well, what'll I call you...

325
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:55,646
Frank or Paco?

326
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:14,623
Sally! Larry!
This is Paco.

327
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:17,209
- Hey, man.
- Larry's a poet.

328
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:19,545
But he works for
an advertising agency.

329
00:32:19,628 --> 00:32:22,172
Sally's an actress,
but works for a photographer.

330
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:23,549
Paco's a policeman.

331
00:32:23,632 --> 00:32:25,676
That's terrific.

332
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:27,302
I work for the police department.

333
00:32:27,386 --> 00:32:29,513
- That's really nice.
- Wow.

334
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,807
See ya.

335
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:35,769
- How are you?
- Pat's a novelist.

336
00:32:35,811 --> 00:32:38,105
But you're working for an insurance
company now, aren't you?

337
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:40,732
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. Paco's a policeman.

338
00:32:40,816 --> 00:32:42,860
Really? How exciting!

339
00:32:42,943 --> 00:32:46,363
Well, not too.
Right now, I'm filing fingerprints.

340
00:32:46,446 --> 00:32:49,074
Listen,
I file insurance policies.

341
00:32:49,783 --> 00:32:52,161
We should get together then,
file or something.

342
00:32:52,244 --> 00:32:55,247
- That was an improvement.
- I wanna ask you something.

343
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:59,751
How come all your friends are
on their way to being somebody else?

344
00:32:59,835 --> 00:33:03,130
Think about that. I wanna
ask you something else too.

345
00:33:03,172 --> 00:33:05,257
Will you do me a big favor?

346
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,342
Don't tell anybody I'm a cop.

347
00:33:07,426 --> 00:33:10,345
You know, let me just sort of
do it myself.

348
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:12,347
Okay.

349
00:33:20,189 --> 00:33:22,649
Hey, man,
are you really a cop?

350
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:26,445
- Right. I am.
- Wow.

351
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,615
You know,
Leslie is a mind fucker.

352
00:33:29,698 --> 00:33:32,951
You gotta be kidding.
I didn't know that.

353
00:33:33,035 --> 00:33:34,828
What's a mind fucker?

354
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,955
Well, that's a chick...

355
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,334
who digs intellectual types
and super-bright guys.

356
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:42,503
Oh, yeah?

357
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:44,838
Well, she's very perceptive.

358
00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:54,139
You know, Japanese culture
and theater and painting...

359
00:33:54,223 --> 00:33:56,183
it's too rigidly stylized.

360
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:59,812
Well, yeah, you know-
Yeah, but...

361
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:04,358
I think after a while,
when you get through that...

362
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:09,238
you start to appreciate the
clarity- you know, the authority.

363
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:11,949
I got a sheep dog.

364
00:34:12,032 --> 00:34:15,077
There have been
sheep dogs in my family...

365
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,496
dating back...

366
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:19,289
for 16 generations...

367
00:34:20,415 --> 00:34:23,293
- Dating back to the Borgias.
- Oh, shit!

368
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:27,047
The family crest...

369
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:30,467
is a sheep dog
pissing into a gondola.

370
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:31,969
Oh, shit!

371
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:41,937
Paco, everybody loves you!

372
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,356
I love you!

373
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:46,692
Hey, Lieutenant,
my wife call for me?

374
00:34:53,115 --> 00:34:55,033
Give her this, will ya?

375
00:34:56,577 --> 00:34:59,580
Officer Serpico reporting, sir.

376
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:02,958
That fucking thing on your lip,
it goes. And get a haircut.

377
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:04,918
- Sir-
- That's an order.

378
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,920
You look like an asshole
with dentures.

379
00:35:09,214 --> 00:35:13,677
- Do I have the right of appeal, sir?
- Sure. Go see Captain Tolkin.

380
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,346
You got one foot in shit already.
Put the other one in.

381
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,682
Where might that be,
I wonder, sir?

382
00:35:20,392 --> 00:35:22,019
Thank you, sir.

383
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,981
That is one hell of a mustache.
I wish I had the guts.

384
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:31,570
Well, I have what I consider to be
good reasons for wearing it, sir.

385
00:35:31,653 --> 00:35:34,364
- You don't have to tell me.
- But I'd like to tell ya, sir.

386
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:36,492
I thought so.

387
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:42,122
I think it's time that we started
to communicate more on the streets.

388
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:45,000
You know, the way it is,
we're totally isolated, sir.

389
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:48,128
We're completely out of touch
with what's happening.

390
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,672
An undercover cop walks around
in disguise...

391
00:35:50,756 --> 00:35:52,716
wearing black shoes
and white socks.

392
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:55,719
Everybody knows who he is.

393
00:35:55,803 --> 00:35:58,055
You made your point.

394
00:35:58,096 --> 00:36:00,432
I want you to keep your mustache.

395
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:04,061
And I'd like you to patrol
in your own car.

396
00:36:04,102 --> 00:36:07,064
Wear whatever you want.
How does that strike you?

397
00:36:07,147 --> 00:36:08,941
I'd like that, sir.

398
00:36:09,858 --> 00:36:12,069
To be honest,
I'm bucking for detective.

399
00:36:12,152 --> 00:36:13,570
No shit.

400
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,749
Hold it!

401
00:37:10,502 --> 00:37:12,254
What the hell are you doing?

402
00:37:14,381 --> 00:37:16,383
Oh, Christ!

403
00:37:17,885 --> 00:37:19,720
Quick. Get against there.

404
00:37:22,264 --> 00:37:24,224
I'm a police officer!
Get over there!

405
00:37:24,266 --> 00:37:26,810
Hey! It's me, Serpico!

406
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:32,524
Hey, I'm a police officer!
Police officer!

407
00:37:32,608 --> 00:37:34,985
Poli- I'm an officer!
I'm a police officer!

408
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:38,071
Jesus, Frank, how was I
supposed to recognize you?

409
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,618
- You stupid fuck.
- Frank, I didn't know you!

410
00:37:42,701 --> 00:37:46,663
You didn't know me?
You fire without looking?

411
00:37:46,747 --> 00:37:50,083
You fire without a warning,
without a fucking brain in your head?

412
00:37:51,084 --> 00:37:53,003
Oh, shit.

413
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:57,716
If I buy one, you motherfucker,
I'm not gonna buy it from you.

414
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,809
Holy shit.

415
00:38:06,892 --> 00:38:09,019
Look at that mess.

416
00:38:13,273 --> 00:38:15,400
Filling out forms till next month.

417
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:17,236
Good.

418
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:19,404
Hey, Jesus, Frank...

419
00:38:19,488 --> 00:38:21,740
I know it's a hell
of a time to ask you...

420
00:38:21,824 --> 00:38:24,326
but I'm gonna have to go through
all that ballistics bullshit...

421
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:25,661
Good. You should.

422
00:38:25,744 --> 00:38:29,456
It's gonna look like hell if I
don't have anything to show for it.

423
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,876
Frank, do me a favor.
Give us the collar.

424
00:38:38,257 --> 00:38:39,508
You motherfucker.

425
00:38:42,845 --> 00:38:46,932
You want the collar, huh? You
don't wanna fill out forms, right?

426
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:02,281
Here.

427
00:39:04,032 --> 00:39:06,702
- You're a buddy.
- I'm a buddy.

428
00:39:07,953 --> 00:39:10,747
Only you tell Tolkin
I gave it to you.

429
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:14,918
I am passing out these marijuana
cigarettes for you to sample...

430
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:17,880
so that when you become
plainclothesmen...

431
00:39:17,963 --> 00:39:21,800
you'll be able to identify
the pungent aroma...

432
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:25,429
and recognize the disorienting effect
of the drug...

433
00:39:25,471 --> 00:39:30,267
when you observe them
in narcotics suspects.

434
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:32,603
Among users of the drug...

435
00:39:32,644 --> 00:39:35,063
a marijuana cigarette...

436
00:39:35,147 --> 00:39:38,275
is referred to as reefer...

437
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:42,779
stick, roach, joint.

438
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:46,742
The drug itself
is referred to as pot...

439
00:39:46,825 --> 00:39:48,744
tea, boo...

440
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,914
stuff, grass.

441
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:56,001
Hey, this is real good shit.

442
00:39:56,668 --> 00:39:59,546
- I gotta have something to eat.
- Oh, look what it is.

443
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,342
Look what it is.
It's a potato factory is what it is.

444
00:40:03,425 --> 00:40:06,595
And I have to have some,
and I love you- I love it.

445
00:40:06,678 --> 00:40:10,808
Have some of that. We have
nothing to- I have to have a dime?

446
00:40:10,891 --> 00:40:13,811
The dime goes
in the little slot there.

447
00:40:13,852 --> 00:40:16,939
That doesn't work.
It's from the Civil War, this machine.

448
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,817
- Pull on it.
- Doesn't, doesn't, doesn't...

449
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,194
- Go ahead, go ahead.
- Shoot it out. Please!

450
00:40:22,277 --> 00:40:25,614
I beg of you! Come out!
Potatoes, come out!

451
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:30,369
You're pretty fuckin' weird
for a cop.

452
00:40:30,452 --> 00:40:32,830
Me? You!

453
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:35,165
- What about you, buddy? You!
- You're the weird guy. Me?

454
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:37,668
- You're a fuckin' hippie.
- It's beautiful, though.

455
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:39,211
The two of us.

456
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,215
Give me.

457
00:40:45,175 --> 00:40:47,261
Where you supposed
to go from here?

458
00:40:48,804 --> 00:40:51,932
93 Precinct, plainclothes.
Put your gun away.

459
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,853
You?

460
00:40:55,936 --> 00:40:58,981
I am scheduled to go
on special assignment...

461
00:40:59,064 --> 00:41:02,568
with the mayor's department
of investigations, detective squad.

462
00:41:04,987 --> 00:41:07,739
- That's gold shield.
- Yeah.

463
00:41:07,823 --> 00:41:10,159
No fouryears in plainclothes?

464
00:41:12,661 --> 00:41:13,912
Who do you know?

465
00:41:13,996 --> 00:41:17,833
I make it my business to know
people- people who can help.

466
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,334
Unfair.

467
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,629
Unfair.

468
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,007
Life is unfair, pal.

469
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,552
I mean, look, you've got
a feel for the streets, and I...

470
00:41:28,635 --> 00:41:31,138
- I've got a feel for the politics.
- Oh, yeah?

471
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:35,100
You and me in a Batmobile, we could
clean up the whole city in no time.

472
00:41:35,184 --> 00:41:37,769
I wonder ifwe can get candy
out of this machine though.

473
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:45,736
No, thanks.

474
00:41:49,656 --> 00:41:52,993
Well, this is a good place
to tell you, Paco.

475
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,790
You know that guy in Texas
I was telling you about?

476
00:42:02,252 --> 00:42:05,881
- What about him?
- I'm gonna marry him in two months...

477
00:42:05,964 --> 00:42:08,008
unless you marry me.

478
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:20,979
What about the theater
and your dancing?

479
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:24,149
A girl has to get
married sometime.

480
00:42:25,818 --> 00:42:28,278
Well, you're a long way
from sometime, Leslie.

481
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:31,448
I thought you were committed.

482
00:42:32,825 --> 00:42:34,785
I am, but...

483
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:38,789
You are, but?

484
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,961
I can go on working,
studying there.

485
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,672
Where? Fort Worth?

486
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,383
Amarillo.

487
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,103
Well, am I invited
to the wedding?

488
00:43:04,022 --> 00:43:05,315
I'll ask Roy.

489
00:43:10,904 --> 00:43:13,323
Yeah, it's pretty good
in this precinct.

490
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:15,367
Here you go.

491
00:43:15,409 --> 00:43:19,329
Usually a 9:00 to 5:00 day is the
best time for policy and bookmaking.

492
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:23,792
If you have to work nights, like
a liquor violation, just call in.

493
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,211
Don't worry about
quotas right now.

494
00:43:26,295 --> 00:43:29,423
Couple of hooker collars
will keep it cool.

495
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:42,644
Been holding this for you.

496
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:45,189
It's from Jewish Max.

497
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,622
First day on the precinct,
I get that.

498
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:48,335
This is great, Frank.

499
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,215
I can open up a whole can
of peas with this.

500
00:44:53,298 --> 00:44:54,883
It's scary.

501
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:58,804
I wanna protect myself.

502
00:44:58,887 --> 00:45:01,056
- You know what we do with this?
- What?

503
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,725
We take it to
Inspector Kellogg.

504
00:45:09,064 --> 00:45:12,442
Kellogg- Didn't he used
to be in plainclothes?

505
00:45:12,526 --> 00:45:16,071
He's the second-highest ranking cop
in the department of investigations.

506
00:45:16,155 --> 00:45:18,448
- So what?
- What do you mean, "so what?"

507
00:45:18,532 --> 00:45:20,784
I happened to be instrumental
in getting the man his job.

508
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:22,953
He owes me.
You understand?

509
00:45:24,204 --> 00:45:26,456
He's the most honest cop
I know, Frank.

510
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:31,086
Frank, trust me.

511
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:47,603
Things like this were common
practice in the bad old days.

512
00:45:47,686 --> 00:45:49,938
Hard to believe
it's still going on.

513
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,320
Serpico, don't you think
it's kind of stupid...

514
00:45:56,403 --> 00:45:59,239
taking an envelope from somebody
you didn't know?

515
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:07,498
What was I supposed to do?
I mean, give me...

516
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:10,709
How would I know what was in it
unless I took it?

517
00:46:10,792 --> 00:46:13,337
You have two alternatives.

518
00:46:13,378 --> 00:46:16,757
You can force me to take you to
the commissioner of investigations.

519
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,092
He'll drag you in front
of a grand jury.

520
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:22,638
- I don't want that.
- I can understand that.

521
00:46:22,721 --> 00:46:24,640
Word will get out.

522
00:46:24,723 --> 00:46:28,644
Before it's all over, they'll find
you face-down in the East River.

523
00:46:34,274 --> 00:46:37,694
- What's the other alternative?
- Forget it.

524
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,032
Well, what do I do with this?

525
00:47:04,263 --> 00:47:06,390
Hey, Sarge?
You got a minute?

526
00:47:09,935 --> 00:47:12,896
Colored cop gave me this.
I didn't know what to do with it.

527
00:47:19,194 --> 00:47:22,030
Well, I'll send it on
to the Benevolent Association.

528
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:35,752
Alfie, come on.

529
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,401
Is that Bjoerling?

530
00:48:05,824 --> 00:48:07,784
No. It's DiStefano.

531
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:12,539
I was sure it was Bjoerling.

532
00:48:19,671 --> 00:48:22,341
You could hear it
better over here.

533
00:48:23,258 --> 00:48:25,427
- That's an invitation, right?
- Right.

534
00:48:26,553 --> 00:48:28,013
For coffee.

535
00:48:29,097 --> 00:48:32,768
I'll have to take a rain check.
I'm due at the hospital.

536
00:48:32,851 --> 00:48:35,979
Why don't you call in sick?
Perfect place.

537
00:48:37,773 --> 00:48:38,982
Not me.

538
00:48:39,066 --> 00:48:41,318
What are you,
dedicated or somethin'?

539
00:48:41,401 --> 00:48:46,114
That's right, I'm dedicated.
Most men can't stand it.

540
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:49,451
- Well, what do they know?
- I like your garden.

541
00:48:55,582 --> 00:48:57,000
Love my garden.

542
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:01,046
Okay. I love your garden.

543
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,466
You know what they say,
don't you?

544
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:07,344
No. What do they say?

545
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:11,515
If you love a man's garden,
you gotta love the man.

546
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,940
You like her, Alfie?

547
00:49:21,483 --> 00:49:24,153
All I can tell you, sir,
is I gave it back.

548
00:49:24,236 --> 00:49:26,655
I gotta get out of the 93.

549
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:30,033
Well, what happened on
your narcotics application?

550
00:49:30,117 --> 00:49:34,079
Looked like it was set, until
I told 'em I was in plainclothes.

551
00:49:34,163 --> 00:49:35,956
It was like
the kiss of death.

552
00:49:35,998 --> 00:49:39,293
They think everybody in clothes
is on the take.

553
00:49:39,334 --> 00:49:42,004
Sir, do you know anything about
the Bronx 7th Division?

554
00:49:42,087 --> 00:49:46,049
I can go there if I want,
but if it's the same shit, screw it.

555
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:49,595
I'd rather answer phones for Spanish
communications unit and go nuts.

556
00:49:49,678 --> 00:49:51,263
Come on, Alfie.

557
00:49:53,015 --> 00:49:55,976
Frank, did anyone
ever tell you...

558
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,645
that you have a tendency
toward self-pity?

559
00:50:00,939 --> 00:50:02,774
No, you're the first.

560
00:50:02,858 --> 00:50:06,361
All right. Frank, I have
a friend up there, Roy Palmer.

561
00:50:06,445 --> 00:50:10,574
He's an administrative officer.
I'll speak with him.

562
00:50:10,657 --> 00:50:12,951
- Good. Thank you, sir.
- Good-bye, Frank.

563
00:50:12,993 --> 00:50:15,162
- God bless you.
- Right.

564
00:50:24,171 --> 00:50:26,799
Frank, Captain McCIain here.

565
00:50:26,882 --> 00:50:28,967
Captain McCIain. Could you
hold on a minute please, sir?

566
00:50:29,051 --> 00:50:30,469
Sure.

567
00:50:37,017 --> 00:50:39,478
Yeah. Sorry.

568
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,480
I saw Inspector Palmer tonight...

569
00:50:41,522 --> 00:50:45,067
and he assures me the 7th Division
is as clean as a hound's tooth.

570
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:47,528
His words, Frank.
"Clean as a hound's tooth."

571
00:50:48,362 --> 00:50:51,323
I told him he was getting
a hardworking officer...

572
00:50:51,406 --> 00:50:55,369
wears a beard, speaks Spanish and
would make a superb undercover man.

573
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:56,662
He was delighted.

574
00:50:56,745 --> 00:51:00,749
That's good news, sir.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

575
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:02,835
Good-bye, Frank.
God bless.

576
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:08,048
When did you start doing that?

577
00:51:09,842 --> 00:51:12,177
McCIain says that Palmer says...

578
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:14,638
that the 7th is as clean
as a hound's tooth.

579
00:51:15,889 --> 00:51:18,851
Well, if that's true,
your problems are over.

580
00:51:24,064 --> 00:51:26,024
Plainclothes division.

581
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,278
Upstairs.

582
00:51:40,247 --> 00:51:42,875
- How are you? Good to see you!
- All right.

583
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:45,002
We heard you were
coming up here. Listen.

584
00:51:45,085 --> 00:51:48,213
Say hello to Nate Smith.
Frank Serpico.

585
00:51:48,297 --> 00:51:51,133
- Jamie Morales, Frank Serpico.
- Serpico?

586
00:51:52,217 --> 00:51:54,553
Hey, babe, you're gonna
love it up here. It's beautiful.

587
00:51:54,636 --> 00:51:56,680
Listen, take-
I'll see youse later, all right?

588
00:51:56,763 --> 00:51:59,141
Take a little ride with me.
Get the feel of the division.

589
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:01,226
- Maybe I should check in first.
- Fuck that. Come on.

590
00:52:02,728 --> 00:52:06,482
Deckk the halls
with boughs ofholly

591
00:52:11,069 --> 00:52:14,740
Ten grand, Dallas-
if Minnesota. Right.

592
00:52:14,823 --> 00:52:16,492
Green Bay, 12 and a half at...

593
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:20,537
You dumb fuck.
We told you this location's hot.

594
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:22,623
We told you to stay the fuck
out of here.

595
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:25,459
Keough, nobody told me.
Honest.

596
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,586
Bullshit.

597
00:52:27,669 --> 00:52:29,421
Come on.
Let's take a walk.

598
00:52:29,505 --> 00:52:31,757
Hi, kid.
All right, a C-note apiece.

599
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,886
No way. We got a complaint.
Right, Frank? Come on.

600
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:38,138
All right.
Make it 200, Keough.

601
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:41,058
Hey, what, are you getting cheap
in your old age, bambino?

602
00:52:41,141 --> 00:52:43,769
- Three.
- Three?

603
00:52:43,852 --> 00:52:45,479
You heard me.

604
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:49,775
- All right, three.
- I'll make it a light one.

605
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:56,698
- You wanna write this up?
- No, I'm gonna check in.

606
00:52:56,782 --> 00:52:58,700
Take the collar, Frank.
Get on the sheet.

607
00:52:58,784 --> 00:53:00,202
I better check in.

608
00:53:02,204 --> 00:53:05,499
We're gonna have
a little talk later, right?

609
00:53:08,961 --> 00:53:12,047
That dumb schmuck only came up with
two bills because I booked him?

610
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,426
Here you go, Frank.

611
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:19,096
It was your collar.
Keep it.

612
00:53:20,556 --> 00:53:23,058
I had a hunch
you weren't gonna take it.

613
00:53:24,226 --> 00:53:27,604
You know, Frankie, we got a call
about you from downtown.

614
00:53:27,688 --> 00:53:29,314
Now, I ain't sayin' who.

615
00:53:29,398 --> 00:53:32,025
They just said you couldn't
be trusted, you know?

616
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,904
- Because I don't take money, right?
- Come on, Frank.

617
00:53:35,988 --> 00:53:38,490
Let's face it. Who can trust
a cop who don't take money?

618
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:42,035
I mean, you are pretty weird,
you know, kid?

619
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:44,872
And with that call, the guys
were gettin' a little worried.

620
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:47,749
I told them you were okay.
I knew you from the old 21.

621
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:51,170
You'd never hurt
another cop, right?

622
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:55,174
You'd never hurt another cop,
would you, Frank?

623
00:53:55,257 --> 00:53:58,051
- That'd depend on what he did.
- That's the wrong answer, Frankie.

624
00:54:03,891 --> 00:54:05,601
We're not doing
anything bad here.

625
00:54:05,684 --> 00:54:08,353
We're skimming
a little gambling money.

626
00:54:08,437 --> 00:54:11,440
It's clean. It's not dope.
It hurts nobody.

627
00:54:11,523 --> 00:54:13,442
Come on, Frank.

628
00:54:13,525 --> 00:54:16,820
Gamblers are gentlemen, and
they're gonna operate anyhow, right?

629
00:54:16,904 --> 00:54:19,406
Look, Keough, you don't have to
explain yourself to me.

630
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:22,618
Do what you got to do.
Want some tea?

631
00:54:22,701 --> 00:54:25,662
No, I don't like that shit.
I'll have a coffee, huh?

632
00:54:25,746 --> 00:54:28,373
What's the matter, Frank?
What are you worried about?

633
00:54:28,415 --> 00:54:31,752
Listen.
We don't go overboard here.

634
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,837
We're not sloppy.
We're careful.

635
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:37,216
The spicks, niggers, we bust them.
They operate so dumb and sloppy...

636
00:54:37,257 --> 00:54:39,384
they get your ass
in hot water every time.

637
00:54:39,426 --> 00:54:41,970
But the Italians, now,
that's a different story.

638
00:54:42,054 --> 00:54:45,265
They're men of their word.
They're reliable, Frankie.

639
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:48,644
- You really got it analyzed.
- Fuckin' right I got it analyzed.

640
00:54:48,727 --> 00:54:50,395
It's worth it.

641
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,982
You know how much
the nut's running now, Frankie?

642
00:54:56,109 --> 00:55:00,113
- No, I wouldn't know that.
- $800 a month.

643
00:55:00,197 --> 00:55:04,618
That's 800 clams every time your
girlfriend gets the curse tax free.

644
00:55:05,452 --> 00:55:08,455
Here's the beauty. You don't
get it for the first eight weeks...

645
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:11,250
till the guys get to
know you and you're okay.

646
00:55:11,333 --> 00:55:13,961
But you don't lose, either, 'cause
you get it on the other end...

647
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,755
when you leave the division.

648
00:55:16,839 --> 00:55:19,883
Frankie, it's like-
it's like severance pay.

649
00:55:21,468 --> 00:55:24,596
Think it over, all right?
In or out.

650
00:55:27,432 --> 00:55:29,977
Look at me. I'm shaking.

651
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:36,400
All my life I wanted
to be a cop, you know?

652
00:55:36,483 --> 00:55:38,861
It's like I can remember
nothing else.

653
00:55:42,489 --> 00:55:44,533
I remember this one time...

654
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,870
there was...

655
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:50,455
Somethin' happened.
A domestic argument or somethin'.

656
00:55:50,539 --> 00:55:52,458
Somebody stabbed somebody.

657
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,919
And...

658
00:55:55,961 --> 00:55:58,547
there was this crowd
around this tenement.

659
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:02,968
I must have been nine,
ten years old. I was this big.

660
00:56:03,051 --> 00:56:04,970
I went over to see
what was going on.

661
00:56:05,053 --> 00:56:08,265
I noticed the red light
goin' around and around...

662
00:56:08,307 --> 00:56:10,767
all these people,
and I couldn't see.

663
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:15,314
I kept saying, "Do you know
what's goin' on? Do you know?"

664
00:56:15,397 --> 00:56:17,566
Nobody knew.

665
00:56:17,649 --> 00:56:20,819
It was like a big mystery
behind that...

666
00:56:20,903 --> 00:56:22,529
that crowd there.

667
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:26,033
All of a sudden...

668
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,160
the crowd just parted...

669
00:56:28,243 --> 00:56:30,579
Like the Red Sea, you see?

670
00:56:30,662 --> 00:56:34,249
And there were these guys
in blue, and I said...

671
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:36,126
"They know."

672
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:40,255
What do they know?
What do they know?

673
00:56:45,552 --> 00:56:47,721
It's amazing.

674
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:49,765
It's incredible...

675
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:53,811
but I feel like a criminal
'cause I don't take money.

676
00:56:57,898 --> 00:57:00,400
You get so tense
when you talk about it.

677
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:01,902
I wonder why.

678
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:03,570
Come here.

679
00:57:07,741 --> 00:57:09,618
- Right there.
- Here?

680
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:14,706
I'm gonna ask you
a question, okay?

681
00:57:14,748 --> 00:57:17,042
Do you like cops?

682
00:57:17,126 --> 00:57:19,086
You're my first.

683
00:57:20,754 --> 00:57:24,133
No, I mean all this shit I've been
telling you. Do you believe it?

684
00:57:24,216 --> 00:57:25,801
Why not?

685
00:57:27,219 --> 00:57:29,763
- Does it shock you?
- Not much.

686
00:57:30,848 --> 00:57:33,475
What's the matter with me?

687
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:35,644
Everybody knows about cops.

688
00:57:36,728 --> 00:57:39,356
Did you ever hear the story
of the wise king?

689
00:57:39,439 --> 00:57:42,568
Nope, but I got the feeling
I'm gonna hear it.

690
00:57:43,652 --> 00:57:48,073
Well, there was this king,
and he ruled over his kingdom.

691
00:57:48,157 --> 00:57:51,577
Right in the middle of the kingdom
there was a well.

692
00:57:51,618 --> 00:57:53,620
That's where everybody drank.

693
00:57:53,704 --> 00:57:57,332
One night,
this witch came along...

694
00:57:57,416 --> 00:57:59,334
and she poisoned the well.

695
00:58:00,419 --> 00:58:03,547
And the next day, everybody drank
from it except the king...

696
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:05,716
and they all went crazy.

697
00:58:05,757 --> 00:58:08,051
They got together
in the street and they said...

698
00:58:08,135 --> 00:58:11,096
"We got to get rid of the king,
'cause the king is mad."

699
00:58:13,432 --> 00:58:16,685
And then that night, he went down
and he drank from the well.

700
00:58:16,768 --> 00:58:19,563
And the next day
all the people rejoiced...

701
00:58:19,605 --> 00:58:23,734
because their king
had regained his reason.

702
00:58:27,446 --> 00:58:29,406
I think you're trying
to tell me somethin'.

703
00:58:29,448 --> 00:58:31,283
- Me?
- Yeah.

704
00:58:33,327 --> 00:58:35,787
Hey, Frank, I want you
to say hello to somebody.

705
00:58:35,871 --> 00:58:39,792
- Drop your cocks and grab your socks!
- What the fuck is this?

706
00:58:41,502 --> 00:58:44,254
Frank Serpico,
say hello to Don Rubello.

707
00:58:44,338 --> 00:58:46,423
- He's gonna be your new partner.
- How you doin'?

708
00:58:48,008 --> 00:58:51,929
If you don't want to work with this
fucking nut for some reason, man...

709
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:54,932
I'll buddy up with him,
all right?

710
00:58:55,015 --> 00:58:57,309
And go through all that crap
changing assignments?

711
00:58:57,392 --> 00:58:59,478
No. We'll be okay.

712
00:58:59,561 --> 00:59:01,396
We're paisans, huh?

713
00:59:04,316 --> 00:59:06,443
- What's with the fucking mouse?
- It's my partner.

714
00:59:06,527 --> 00:59:09,279
- Partner?
- He's specially trained, you know?

715
00:59:09,363 --> 00:59:12,491
He goes to track down heroin.

716
00:59:12,574 --> 00:59:15,244
Let him loose, goes into the hole,
picks it up, brings it back...

717
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,788
sniffs it out,
brings it to you.

718
00:59:19,498 --> 00:59:22,251
- Yeah. I heard of that.
- You heard of that?

719
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:29,258
This guy I'm looking for,
Vernon...

720
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:32,386
He's a numbers collector who ain't
been meeting his obligations.

721
00:59:33,846 --> 00:59:37,391
He won't be hard to spot.
He's a mover. This is prime time.

722
00:59:40,936 --> 00:59:44,606
Since we're partners,
you gotta know the situation.

723
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:48,735
Straight off.
I collect for the division...

724
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:50,904
me and two other bagmen.

725
00:59:50,988 --> 00:59:53,448
That's what Keough
was sort of hinting at.

726
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:58,412
Three of us pick up
the payoff twice a month.

727
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,707
Hey!
Look, there he is.

728
01:00:14,303 --> 01:00:16,638
Son of a bitch!

729
01:00:21,143 --> 01:00:23,979
- Look out!
- You stupid bastard!

730
01:01:38,011 --> 01:01:39,471
Where's the money?

731
01:01:47,855 --> 01:01:49,940
You been jerking me around,
you fuck! Huh?

732
01:01:50,023 --> 01:01:52,317
Ain't no money!
I'm behind now, man!

733
01:01:56,572 --> 01:01:58,407
Three times you never show,
right?

734
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:02,703
I'll have it for you tonight,
I swear.

735
01:02:02,786 --> 01:02:04,705
Don't bust me!

736
01:02:06,582 --> 01:02:09,251
Last time, Vernon.
The last time.

737
01:02:09,334 --> 01:02:13,464
You fuck me and you're gone,
you hear? You hear? Huh?

738
01:02:14,923 --> 01:02:16,967
See you at the Domino,
midnight.

739
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:21,138
And you'd better have $300, ya fuck.
You hear? Right? Right?

740
01:02:24,183 --> 01:02:26,101
All right, Frank.

741
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:34,735
I keep this place
for socializing.

742
01:02:34,818 --> 01:02:38,238
Someday we'll get a couple of
broads, huh? Have a little party.

743
01:02:44,328 --> 01:02:46,580
Make some ice.
Booze is right over here.

744
01:02:51,043 --> 01:02:53,796
So what do you think, Frank?
About the money?

745
01:02:54,421 --> 01:02:56,590
Look, Don...

746
01:02:56,673 --> 01:03:01,094
if I was broke, if I had a family-
I don't know.

747
01:03:01,178 --> 01:03:03,138
But I'm not broke,
and I don't have a family.

748
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,557
So why the fuck stick my neck out?

749
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:08,685
It's already out, Frank-
not taking the money.

750
01:03:08,769 --> 01:03:10,938
It's better the other guys
don't know that.

751
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:12,940
Hey, I tell you what I'll do.

752
01:03:14,525 --> 01:03:16,193
I'll hold your share
for you, huh?

753
01:03:16,276 --> 01:03:19,238
You change your mind,
it'll be right in here.

754
01:03:19,279 --> 01:03:21,698
Right in here,
right down to the penny, huh?

755
01:03:21,782 --> 01:03:23,867
Hey. Look at that.

756
01:03:23,909 --> 01:03:27,329
- What are you drinking?
- Give me a scotch.

757
01:03:30,749 --> 01:03:33,669
Next thing I wanna do, I wanna
get a color TV for the games.

758
01:03:33,752 --> 01:03:37,172
Hey, how about some gin?
Penny a point. Huh?

759
01:03:53,856 --> 01:03:55,941
Yeah.
Let me ask him first.

760
01:04:04,783 --> 01:04:06,702
Hello, Frank.
Get in.

761
01:04:14,918 --> 01:04:16,503
My God, Frank.
This is confidential.

762
01:04:18,547 --> 01:04:20,799
He's a police officer.
I thought maybe he could sit in.

763
01:04:20,883 --> 01:04:22,885
No, absolutely not.

764
01:04:22,968 --> 01:04:24,928
All right, all right.

765
01:04:28,307 --> 01:04:31,393
I notified Commissioner Delaney
about everything you told me.

766
01:04:31,477 --> 01:04:35,522
He wants you to stay where you are
and continue to collect information.

767
01:04:35,606 --> 01:04:38,317
Then you'll be
his eyes and his ears.

768
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,736
He said he was delighted
that, quote...

769
01:04:40,777 --> 01:04:44,156
"A man of integrity
had surfaced," unquote.

770
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:47,910
When do I hear from him?

771
01:04:47,951 --> 01:04:51,121
He said he'd reach out for you
when the time comes.

772
01:04:53,582 --> 01:04:55,000
Reach out?

773
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:59,797
See, you know, my situation's
pretty fuckin' sticky up there.

774
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,090
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
Just wait for him...

775
01:05:02,174 --> 01:05:04,802
- You must have patience, Frank.
- But it's pretty fucking sticky.

776
01:05:04,885 --> 01:05:06,428
Patience and faith.

777
01:05:06,512 --> 01:05:09,848
When a man like the commissioner
says he'll get in touch with you...

778
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:11,850
he'll get in touch with you.

779
01:05:13,602 --> 01:05:15,270
Good-bye, son.
God bless you.

780
01:05:30,285 --> 01:05:32,913
All right, now.
Marinda's too hot.

781
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:35,582
We got to lay off him
for a couple of months.

782
01:05:35,666 --> 01:05:38,252
And listen, Falco's got two runners
he ain't paying for.

783
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:41,255
Check that fucking guy out, huh?
Hey, Frankie, how are you?

784
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:44,383
- How are you?
- Rubello's being transferred...

785
01:05:44,424 --> 01:05:46,301
so you're gonna have to work
with a new bagman.

786
01:05:46,385 --> 01:05:49,930
Al Sarno, I want you to meet Frank
Serpico. This'll be your new man.

787
01:05:50,013 --> 01:05:51,598
- How are you?
- Fine.

788
01:05:51,682 --> 01:05:54,726
Listen, you know that operation
down by Hunt's Point, the new one?

789
01:05:54,768 --> 01:05:56,895
What are we gonna do about that?
Who are we givin' to?

790
01:05:56,979 --> 01:05:59,523
You the new bagman,
you prick?

791
01:05:59,606 --> 01:06:03,944
What happened to Rubello, you son
of a bitch? You narco cop fucker!

792
01:06:04,027 --> 01:06:05,946
Wait a minute.

793
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:20,627
You know, Frank,
sometimes I ask myself...

794
01:06:20,711 --> 01:06:22,880
what the fuck am I doing?

795
01:06:24,923 --> 01:06:27,551
You know,
if this ever came out...

796
01:06:27,634 --> 01:06:29,595
Christ, my family.

797
01:06:31,305 --> 01:06:32,598
My daughter.

798
01:06:34,099 --> 01:06:36,351
She just started
with the San Francisco Opera.

799
01:06:36,435 --> 01:06:37,769
Chorus.

800
01:06:38,854 --> 01:06:40,939
Took a lot of money.

801
01:06:42,483 --> 01:06:44,943
I once tried to pull out.

802
01:06:45,027 --> 01:06:47,196
Christ, they were all over me.

803
01:06:47,279 --> 01:06:49,323
So you...

804
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:51,325
just go along.

805
01:06:55,162 --> 01:06:57,706
Unless you're willing
to go back to uniform duty.

806
01:07:15,724 --> 01:07:17,935
Shit.
How the money rolls in.

807
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:22,731
- Here. Let me give you yours now.
- I'm not on.

808
01:07:23,732 --> 01:07:26,068
- What do you mean, you're not on?
- Just what I said.

809
01:07:26,109 --> 01:07:28,737
I'm not on.
I don't take money.

810
01:07:28,779 --> 01:07:31,281
- Some gag. Here.
- No, I told you straight.

811
01:07:32,324 --> 01:07:34,910
I don't take money,
and that's the truth.

812
01:07:36,995 --> 01:07:39,957
- What were you doing with Rubello?
- Ask Rubello.

813
01:07:43,669 --> 01:07:46,130
Your nut-
where's it been going?

814
01:07:46,213 --> 01:07:47,756
Ask Rubello.

815
01:07:50,342 --> 01:07:52,469
All right, then, sir.
I'll go to Delaney myselfthen.

816
01:07:52,553 --> 01:07:56,140
- That would not be advisable.
- You don't understand, Captain.

817
01:07:56,223 --> 01:07:59,893
- It's been weeks. Not a word.
- I understand perfectly.

818
01:07:59,977 --> 01:08:02,437
No, but, Captain,
now they know I'm not on.

819
01:08:02,521 --> 01:08:04,773
I've done all I can do.
Good-bye, Frank.

820
01:08:10,237 --> 01:08:13,365
He's out.
Won't do another fucking thing.

821
01:08:14,908 --> 01:08:17,619
Blair, I'm telling you, nothing's
gonna happen from the inside.

822
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:19,997
The top guys have been
cops too long.

823
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,959
You haven't heard from
Commissioner Delaney, have you?

824
01:08:24,042 --> 01:08:25,711
No, not a fucking word.

825
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:34,511
Would you be willing to go
outside the department?

826
01:08:35,512 --> 01:08:37,306
Where could we go?

827
01:08:38,599 --> 01:08:40,809
Would you believe
the mayor's office?

828
01:08:49,318 --> 01:08:51,487
- The mayor's office?
- His right-hand man...

829
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:54,281
guy named Jerry Berman,
from Princeton.

830
01:08:54,364 --> 01:08:57,075
You knew I knew somebody.
That's the somebody I know.

831
01:08:57,159 --> 01:08:59,161
And he cares, Frank.
He really cares.

832
01:09:03,665 --> 01:09:05,918
- You know what we're doing?
- Yeah.

833
01:09:06,001 --> 01:09:08,837
- We're going outside the department.
- That's right.

834
01:09:12,883 --> 01:09:14,092
Dynamite.

835
01:09:14,176 --> 01:09:17,304
Every plainclothes man
in the division...

836
01:09:17,346 --> 01:09:19,681
and one,
maybe two lieutenants?

837
01:09:19,765 --> 01:09:23,769
That is dynamite.
That is incredible.

838
01:09:23,852 --> 01:09:27,064
That is 150...

839
01:09:27,147 --> 01:09:30,192
That is $250,000 a year...

840
01:09:30,275 --> 01:09:33,278
but that is just one precinct.

841
01:09:33,362 --> 01:09:36,031
Oh, that is amazing!

842
01:09:37,032 --> 01:09:40,661
See, what I feel is needed here
is, like, a real investigation.

843
01:09:40,744 --> 01:09:43,872
And I am sure that the mayor
will see this immediately.

844
01:09:44,665 --> 01:09:46,792
McCIain and Delaney...

845
01:09:46,875 --> 01:09:49,336
they have done nothing?

846
01:09:49,378 --> 01:09:51,130
Oh, man.
That is amazing.

847
01:09:54,299 --> 01:09:57,553
Another thing.
See, in a couple of days...

848
01:09:57,636 --> 01:09:59,221
they're gonna have
a meeting of the pad.

849
01:09:59,304 --> 01:10:00,556
Oh, right.

850
01:10:00,639 --> 01:10:03,517
- Frank is in a very tough spot.
- I can see that.

851
01:10:03,559 --> 01:10:07,813
Rumors. See, I have heard rumors,
but never touching it directly.

852
01:10:07,896 --> 01:10:13,360
And for an on-the-line cop to come
forward like this is beautiful.

853
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:15,654
Really, Frank, I mean...

854
01:10:15,737 --> 01:10:18,615
you have my respect
and my sympathy...

855
01:10:18,699 --> 01:10:20,617
for what you've been
going through, man.

856
01:10:20,659 --> 01:10:22,453
Wow.

857
01:10:27,207 --> 01:10:29,543
Hello.
This is Jerry Berman.

858
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:32,379
Is he there?
All right. I'll hold on.

859
01:10:49,396 --> 01:10:50,856
Well?

860
01:10:52,566 --> 01:10:54,651
Tell me what happened,
Paco.

861
01:10:54,693 --> 01:10:56,653
I'd like a drink.

862
01:11:02,117 --> 01:11:04,369
That guy is gonna
go to the mayor.

863
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:11,543
To the mayor!

864
01:11:14,046 --> 01:11:16,423
Come here, Alfie. We're all
gonna go to the mayor together.

865
01:11:16,507 --> 01:11:18,425
You know that?

866
01:11:22,054 --> 01:11:24,389
I couldn't be
any more embarrassed.

867
01:11:26,099 --> 01:11:28,185
It's like a personal defeat.

868
01:11:29,895 --> 01:11:31,855
However...

869
01:11:31,897 --> 01:11:33,857
there are priorities.

870
01:11:33,899 --> 01:11:36,360
What are the priorities,
Jerry?

871
01:11:36,401 --> 01:11:38,529
The priorities are...

872
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:41,031
a long, hot summer ahead...

873
01:11:41,073 --> 01:11:43,826
and riots are expected...

874
01:11:45,077 --> 01:11:49,081
and the mayor cannot
alienate the police force.

875
01:11:49,164 --> 01:11:51,959
Now, in the fall...

876
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:54,878
Now, in the fall,
it may be possible...

877
01:11:54,962 --> 01:11:56,880
to take another look
at the situation.

878
01:11:56,964 --> 01:11:58,757
All right, fine.
I'm sorry.

879
01:12:12,604 --> 01:12:14,565
They're all rotten.

880
01:12:14,648 --> 01:12:16,733
Chickenshit.

881
01:12:16,817 --> 01:12:18,861
The whole fucking
system's corrupt.

882
01:12:23,407 --> 01:12:25,951
- Who's there?
- It's me. I gotta talk to ya.

883
01:12:29,246 --> 01:12:33,542
You know, Frank, you're behaving
like a goddamn child. You hear?

884
01:12:33,584 --> 01:12:35,544
Let him in.

885
01:12:37,254 --> 01:12:39,214
You let him in.

886
01:12:57,441 --> 01:13:00,611
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm sorry
I got you into the whole thing.

887
01:13:00,694 --> 01:13:03,780
Bullshit! I got me
into this whole thing.

888
01:13:05,157 --> 01:13:07,493
"Wow. Amazing!

889
01:13:07,576 --> 01:13:11,413
"Dynamite!
Beautiful! Dynamite!

890
01:13:11,497 --> 01:13:13,415
Priorities. Priorities."

891
01:13:13,499 --> 01:13:16,460
You and your big-deal friends,
your contacts...

892
01:13:16,502 --> 01:13:18,796
your big bullshit names.

893
01:13:18,879 --> 01:13:21,632
Bob Blair, the big operator
from Princeton.

894
01:13:21,715 --> 01:13:24,676
The mystery man with the connections,
the hot line to the mayor.

895
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,887
Who the fuck do you think you are,
you son of a bitch?

896
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:29,723
You come looking for help,
whining, mealy-mouthed...

897
01:13:29,807 --> 01:13:31,975
with your humble-pie act-
the saint, the injured innocent.

898
01:13:32,059 --> 01:13:33,977
Who told you the department
or the whole world...

899
01:13:34,061 --> 01:13:36,605
was some kind
of a fucking boy scout camp?

900
01:13:38,398 --> 01:13:42,986
What do you expect, for Christ's
sake, a magician? A big daddy?

901
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:46,490
White knight snaps his fingers,
the dirty world turns white...

902
01:13:46,573 --> 01:13:48,492
Just keep talking.
That's what you can do.

903
01:13:48,575 --> 01:13:51,036
while the Pope's choir sings
"Ave Maria," is that it?

904
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,248
You gonna blame me 'cause those
bastards don't wanna get involved?

905
01:13:55,332 --> 01:13:57,126
I tried to help you.
I got my head handed to me.

906
01:13:57,209 --> 01:13:59,920
Where's your head? It's on
your shoulders. That's what I see.

907
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:03,257
- You don't look so hot yourself.
- What's all this shit over here?

908
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:05,551
Get ready to blow up again,
'cause I got another idea.

909
01:14:05,592 --> 01:14:08,220
You and your ideas
are as full of shit as you are.

910
01:14:08,262 --> 01:14:10,764
- Right on cue.
- Right on cue.

911
01:14:10,848 --> 01:14:12,516
We can talk to Foreman,
the commissioner of investigations.

912
01:14:12,599 --> 01:14:15,227
Another guy!
We got another guy here.

913
01:14:15,269 --> 01:14:17,729
We could even talk to a guy
I know on the New York Times.

914
01:14:18,939 --> 01:14:22,609
Oh, that's terrific.
Go to the Times.

915
01:14:22,693 --> 01:14:25,904
Every time I talk to you, Blair,
20 more people know about it.

916
01:14:25,988 --> 01:14:27,447
This is safe, Frank.

917
01:14:27,489 --> 01:14:29,324
It's safe? With my ass on the line,
it's safe, right?

918
01:14:29,408 --> 01:14:33,036
- Your ass is already on the line!
- That's my business!

919
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,164
- You don't trust me, Frank?
- I don't trust you!

920
01:14:35,247 --> 01:14:36,790
- Go fuckyourself!
- Fuckyou!

921
01:14:41,628 --> 01:14:43,589
Look, when I come home,
I want a house clean.

922
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:47,176
- Don't take it out on me, Paco.
- I don't want to pick up shit!

923
01:15:28,133 --> 01:15:30,135
Honey...

924
01:15:30,219 --> 01:15:32,304
come to bed.

925
01:16:40,664 --> 01:16:43,250
All right. Look, we all know
what this is about, right?

926
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:47,212
Frank, what the hell was happening
between you and Don Rubello?

927
01:16:50,215 --> 01:16:54,094
Simple. I didn't take any money.
I don't take money.

928
01:16:54,178 --> 01:16:58,974
Rubello said if I changed my mind,
he'd hold my share...

929
01:16:59,016 --> 01:17:01,602
he'd give it back to me.

930
01:17:01,685 --> 01:17:04,229
- I didn't change my mind.
- The conniving bastard.

931
01:17:04,313 --> 01:17:08,025
- All right. I'll handle Rubello.
- Donny was stealing.

932
01:17:08,108 --> 01:17:11,820
I'll get back the money he took.
But this ain't gonna happen again.

933
01:17:11,904 --> 01:17:15,657
From now on, no more three bagmen.
Starting today, every one ofyou...

934
01:17:15,699 --> 01:17:20,454
makes his own collections-
no stops, no bread, okay?

935
01:17:20,537 --> 01:17:22,456
- Right.
- You got it.

936
01:17:22,539 --> 01:17:26,668
What about you, Frankie?
I'll make up what Don took from you.

937
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:31,340
- Why should I start now?
- Everybody'd feel better about you.

938
01:17:31,423 --> 01:17:33,133
You can always give it
to charity.

939
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,721
Look, Frankie, what do you say,
a hundred a month just for expenses?

940
01:17:38,764 --> 01:17:42,351
For my secretary and my
business lunches, entertainment?

941
01:17:45,854 --> 01:17:50,400
All right. All right.
We split Frank's share from now on.

942
01:17:50,484 --> 01:17:52,444
You're a schmuck, Frank.

943
01:18:00,452 --> 01:18:02,913
If they would take
all that energy, see...

944
01:18:02,996 --> 01:18:05,082
put it into
straight police work...

945
01:18:05,165 --> 01:18:06,542
we'd have the city
cleaned up in a week.

946
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:09,044
They'd clean up.
There'd be no crime.

947
01:18:15,884 --> 01:18:18,720
If I could work alone-
That's the thing, see?

948
01:18:18,804 --> 01:18:21,473
If I could just get- Work alone.
But they don't like that.

949
01:18:21,557 --> 01:18:23,642
They don't want that.
They want to suckyou in.

950
01:18:23,725 --> 01:18:26,478
You go over
the same thing, Paco.

951
01:18:26,562 --> 01:18:30,774
So fucking corrupt. Everybody,
everyone. Nobody giving a shit!

952
01:18:30,858 --> 01:18:34,027
There's gotta be a way
to wipe it out, goddamn it.

953
01:18:34,069 --> 01:18:36,738
Let's get out of here for a while,
huh, honey? Let's go to a movie.

954
01:18:36,822 --> 01:18:40,284
Quit handling me! What are you
doing? How am I gonna go to a movie?

955
01:18:40,367 --> 01:18:43,829
They'd kill me if they knew!
You think that hasn't happened?

956
01:18:43,912 --> 01:18:47,749
Eitheryou're exploding, oryou're
Iying around like a catatonic!

957
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:51,295
- I can't stand it, Paco.
- You don't give a shit, right?

958
01:18:51,378 --> 01:18:54,673
All I care about is you!
That's all that matters to me.

959
01:18:54,715 --> 01:18:58,343
That's why it hurts so much.
I can't stand to see you like this...

960
01:18:58,385 --> 01:19:01,805
Scared, miserable,
dreading to go to work.

961
01:19:01,889 --> 01:19:03,807
It's tearing me apart!

962
01:19:03,849 --> 01:19:07,436
And then I get sick of hearing
about it, and I start hating myself.

963
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:11,356
You didn't like my being a cop,
so don't give me that shit.

964
01:19:11,398 --> 01:19:16,820
I love you! I want to marry you!
I want to have children with you!

965
01:19:16,904 --> 01:19:20,699
- Goddamn it! I hate it!
- Why don't you get out?

966
01:19:20,783 --> 01:19:24,787
- Why don't you?
- It's crossed my mind.

967
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:27,539
Well, do it.

968
01:19:40,761 --> 01:19:44,306
- What do you got?
- Would you bust whitey?

969
01:19:44,389 --> 01:19:46,308
Try me. Try me.

970
01:19:47,309 --> 01:19:50,354
This guy's heavy.
He's Italian.

971
01:19:50,395 --> 01:19:54,107
Mobbed up.
Still interested?

972
01:19:54,191 --> 01:19:57,027
Stop fuckin' around.
I'm not in the mood. Come on.

973
01:19:57,069 --> 01:20:01,657
He's a loan shark,
runs a big numbers operation.

974
01:20:01,698 --> 01:20:04,243
This mother's so cocksure...

975
01:20:04,326 --> 01:20:07,579
he picks up his own slips
while he's collecting his loans.

976
01:20:07,663 --> 01:20:09,081
Where's the drop?

977
01:20:56,503 --> 01:20:57,754
Hold it!

978
01:20:57,838 --> 01:21:00,507
I'm a police officer.

979
01:21:00,591 --> 01:21:01,925
And...

980
01:21:04,303 --> 01:21:07,097
Wait a minute.
You're under arrest.

981
01:21:08,557 --> 01:21:11,477
- I thought you were a junkie.
- I'll take that wad in your pocket.

982
01:21:13,687 --> 01:21:15,439
- You're a riot, kid.
- I know. I'm a joke.

983
01:21:15,522 --> 01:21:17,733
What are you doin'?
What's that?

984
01:21:19,234 --> 01:21:22,237
Put that away, oryou're in more
trouble. Give me your car keys.

985
01:21:28,035 --> 01:21:30,204
Where they been
hiding you, kid?

986
01:21:30,287 --> 01:21:32,372
Wouldn't you like to know?

987
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:37,211
Hold this guy for booking.
Get a rap sheet on him.

988
01:21:37,294 --> 01:21:39,254
I'm gonna search his car.

989
01:22:02,569 --> 01:22:04,113
Where's Corsaro?

990
01:22:04,196 --> 01:22:06,115
Smith took him upstairs.

991
01:22:16,041 --> 01:22:18,544
I swear to God, I thought this guy
was some fucking junkie.

992
01:22:21,046 --> 01:22:23,298
Listen, Rudy, you should
see some of the...

993
01:22:34,268 --> 01:22:36,645
- Hey, you.
- Hey, who?

994
01:22:37,563 --> 01:22:40,858
You. Get over here
and empty your pockets.

995
01:22:40,941 --> 01:22:44,194
- I don't do that.
- You're my prisoner. Do what I say.

996
01:22:44,278 --> 01:22:46,738
- Get over here.
- He's gonna get nasty about it.

997
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:49,575
You're fucking right!

998
01:22:49,658 --> 01:22:52,327
Hey, Frank, cool it, huh?

999
01:22:52,411 --> 01:22:55,038
Lean, motherfuck!
Spread!

1000
01:22:55,122 --> 01:22:57,458
Frank. Hey, Frank, Rudy's on.
He's good people.

1001
01:22:57,499 --> 01:23:00,085
Stay the fuck outta this!

1002
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:03,130
You fuck!

1003
01:23:04,423 --> 01:23:06,550
What's this?
What's this?

1004
01:23:06,633 --> 01:23:08,552
Get in! Get in!

1005
01:23:57,684 --> 01:24:01,396
Serpico.
Got that record check on Corsaro.

1006
01:24:16,203 --> 01:24:18,288
You want to read something?

1007
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:22,668
It's about your pal Corsaro.

1008
01:24:22,709 --> 01:24:25,504
Here, read it.
Read it!

1009
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:31,135
He did 15 years.
You know what for?

1010
01:24:31,218 --> 01:24:34,304
For killing a cop.
He's a fucking cop killer.

1011
01:24:45,983 --> 01:24:48,110
- It's good to see you again.
- I've had it. I'm finished.

1012
01:24:48,193 --> 01:24:50,821
- What's wrong?
- I can't take it. I gotta get out.

1013
01:24:50,904 --> 01:24:53,449
If I have to go back to uniform,
I'm going back to uniform.

1014
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:57,119
I can't wait for Delaney to call.
I can't play their game anymore.

1015
01:24:57,161 --> 01:25:00,122
The commissioner didn't
get in touch with you?

1016
01:25:00,205 --> 01:25:03,125
Not a word. No investigation,
no undercover work, nothing!

1017
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:07,379
- I had no idea, Frank.
- It's only fair to tell you.

1018
01:25:07,463 --> 01:25:09,923
I've been to outside agencies.
I'll go to more if I have to.

1019
01:25:10,007 --> 01:25:12,176
What outside agencies?

1020
01:25:12,259 --> 01:25:16,513
Holy Mother of God! Frank, we wash
our own laundry around here!

1021
01:25:16,555 --> 01:25:21,268
- You could be brought up on charges!
- We do not wash our own laundry!

1022
01:25:21,351 --> 01:25:22,769
- It just gets dirtier!
- You are in trouble!

1023
01:25:22,853 --> 01:25:25,981
I don't care if I'm in trouble.
I don't care who gets it.

1024
01:25:26,023 --> 01:25:29,777
- If I have to go to outside agencies-
- Stay away from outside agencies!

1025
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:31,820
- Where am I gonna go?
- You hear me?

1026
01:25:31,862 --> 01:25:34,114
- Where am I gonna go?
- Wait until you hear from me.

1027
01:25:34,198 --> 01:25:36,074
- I've been waiting for 11/2 years.
- I'll get back to you.

1028
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:39,411
That's not enough!
Where am I gonna go?

1029
01:25:42,039 --> 01:25:44,500
It's my life, you fuck!

1030
01:25:46,043 --> 01:25:49,379
Serpico, see Inspector Palmer.

1031
01:25:57,387 --> 01:25:59,306
For this precinct,
cases reported...

1032
01:25:59,389 --> 01:26:04,978
Murder- 14 for August,
20 for September, 23...

1033
01:26:07,898 --> 01:26:09,316
Inspector Palmer?

1034
01:26:12,069 --> 01:26:15,030
Deputy Chief Inspector Daley
and Inspector Gilbert...

1035
01:26:15,072 --> 01:26:17,199
are waiting to see you.

1036
01:26:20,577 --> 01:26:22,830
You want to come
to my office?

1037
01:26:29,002 --> 01:26:31,380
Captain McCIain called me.

1038
01:26:31,463 --> 01:26:33,549
I briefed Inspector Daley
and Inspector Gilbert...

1039
01:26:33,632 --> 01:26:36,093
on your allegations.

1040
01:26:36,176 --> 01:26:40,722
The question is, in all these
months, why didn't you come to us?

1041
01:26:43,267 --> 01:26:44,726
Well...

1042
01:26:47,521 --> 01:26:50,816
I never met these gentlemen
before, sir, and...

1043
01:26:50,899 --> 01:26:53,318
you told...

1044
01:26:53,402 --> 01:26:55,988
I mean,
you told Captain McCIain...

1045
01:26:56,029 --> 01:26:58,490
that the division was as clean
as a hound's tooth.

1046
01:26:58,574 --> 01:27:02,286
You think you're the only honest cop
on the force, Serpico?

1047
01:27:02,369 --> 01:27:04,455
My record's clear.

1048
01:27:04,538 --> 01:27:06,665
Inspector Gilbert's just
come from the commissioner's...

1049
01:27:06,748 --> 01:27:08,667
confidential
investigation unit.

1050
01:27:09,918 --> 01:27:12,588
Then you must have
heard something. I mean...

1051
01:27:14,965 --> 01:27:16,383
I don't understand.

1052
01:27:16,467 --> 01:27:19,094
Commissioner Delaney has known
about this from the beginning.

1053
01:27:21,555 --> 01:27:23,974
No, I didn't hear a thing.

1054
01:27:24,057 --> 01:27:27,227
But I understand
your frustration, Frank...

1055
01:27:27,311 --> 01:27:29,396
believe me.

1056
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:32,608
I mean, it's sort of like
trying to punch your way...

1057
01:27:32,691 --> 01:27:34,777
out of a paper bag,
right?

1058
01:27:38,113 --> 01:27:40,532
What outside agencies
have you been to, Frank?

1059
01:27:48,499 --> 01:27:50,959
I don't see how that's pertinent
to my allegations.

1060
01:27:52,586 --> 01:27:55,839
We ought to ask Serpico directly
if he's gonna cooperate or not.

1061
01:27:55,923 --> 01:27:57,841
- Come on.
- We've gotta know...

1062
01:27:57,925 --> 01:28:00,385
if there's any real basis
for an investigation.

1063
01:28:03,305 --> 01:28:05,265
Well, I...

1064
01:28:05,307 --> 01:28:07,392
I'll have to think that...

1065
01:28:07,476 --> 01:28:09,978
I'm gonna have to think
about that.

1066
01:28:10,062 --> 01:28:13,190
What is there
to think about?

1067
01:28:13,273 --> 01:28:15,984
I don't see how the division
can investigate itself, sir.

1068
01:28:18,112 --> 01:28:21,031
You've got a point there.

1069
01:28:21,073 --> 01:28:24,910
But you would cooperate with
an impartial investigation, right?

1070
01:28:27,788 --> 01:28:32,584
Yeah. Up to a point.
As long as I'm not involved.

1071
01:28:34,086 --> 01:28:37,714
I just want to go someplace
where I can do my job.

1072
01:28:37,798 --> 01:28:40,384
That's fair enough.

1073
01:28:40,425 --> 01:28:42,386
We'll be in touch.

1074
01:28:46,557 --> 01:28:48,475
Inspector Palmer?

1075
01:28:48,559 --> 01:28:50,644
May I see you a minute?

1076
01:28:56,024 --> 01:28:58,110
Was it necessary to let everyone
in the station house...

1077
01:28:58,193 --> 01:29:00,946
know I was comin' in here
to see these guys?

1078
01:29:01,029 --> 01:29:03,365
You believe from what you now know
that a full-scale investigation...

1079
01:29:03,449 --> 01:29:04,825
is warranted?

1080
01:29:05,909 --> 01:29:08,579
- Yes, Commissioner Delaney.
- Go to it.

1081
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:15,043
But, sir...

1082
01:29:15,127 --> 01:29:17,629
shouldn't headquarters
handle something like this?

1083
01:29:18,547 --> 01:29:22,468
No.
You're all experienced men.

1084
01:29:24,553 --> 01:29:26,930
Chief Gallagher here will be
available for consultation.

1085
01:29:32,978 --> 01:29:34,396
Commissioner...

1086
01:29:37,065 --> 01:29:40,778
Serpico claims that...

1087
01:29:40,861 --> 01:29:44,114
McCIain talked to you about
this whole thing some time ago.

1088
01:29:44,198 --> 01:29:47,951
Yes. I seem to remember
something about that.

1089
01:29:52,623 --> 01:29:57,252
We can't set up a surveillance on
"somewhere over by Crotona Park."

1090
01:29:57,336 --> 01:29:59,338
We need a location!

1091
01:29:59,421 --> 01:30:02,299
I've given you 36 locations
that are paying off.

1092
01:30:02,341 --> 01:30:06,011
Now, what do you want? The whole
thing signed, sealed, delivered?

1093
01:30:06,094 --> 01:30:08,931
You're conducting this
investigation, not me.

1094
01:30:08,972 --> 01:30:11,058
Lieutenant Smith-
Let's get back to him.

1095
01:30:11,141 --> 01:30:15,479
Lieutenant Smith.
Lieutenant Smith said to me...

1096
01:30:15,562 --> 01:30:19,358
if I didn't want the money that
he would stash it in his attic.

1097
01:30:20,109 --> 01:30:21,527
I'll have him transferred
in the morning.

1098
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:24,404
Fuck him.
How about transferring me?

1099
01:30:36,959 --> 01:30:38,961
I hear you been
vouchering pad money...

1100
01:30:39,044 --> 01:30:42,840
over to a confidential
investigation squad.

1101
01:30:42,923 --> 01:30:47,427
Oh, yeah? How can I voucher money
when I don't take any?

1102
01:30:47,469 --> 01:30:49,429
You won't find anything
on Serpico.

1103
01:30:52,349 --> 01:30:54,476
He's clean.

1104
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,019
Right?

1105
01:30:59,189 --> 01:31:01,066
You practicing your frisk?

1106
01:31:04,528 --> 01:31:07,114
I'm looking to buy
a used tape recorder.

1107
01:31:10,325 --> 01:31:13,996
They're feeling me up every day.
How am I gonna wear a wire?

1108
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:15,497
Come on, Frank.

1109
01:31:15,581 --> 01:31:20,627
Wearing a wire means testifying to
corroborate the tape, right? Right.

1110
01:31:20,669 --> 01:31:23,672
I'm not testifying.

1111
01:31:23,755 --> 01:31:25,924
I gotta put a dime
in the parking meter.

1112
01:31:26,008 --> 01:31:29,470
Ragland, put a dime
in the parking meter for Serpico.

1113
01:31:34,475 --> 01:31:39,396
Hey, Frank. Frank, you know
Herman Tauber, district attorney?

1114
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:40,898
Yeah, I watch television.

1115
01:31:40,981 --> 01:31:45,360
Frank, I want to compliment you
for coming forward like this.

1116
01:31:45,444 --> 01:31:47,362
It's unique.

1117
01:31:47,446 --> 01:31:51,450
It's uniquely unique.
You should be proud of yourself.

1118
01:31:51,533 --> 01:31:54,578
There's gonna be a grand jury
on these shitheels...

1119
01:31:54,661 --> 01:31:57,873
with Frank Serpico
as my star witness.

1120
01:31:57,956 --> 01:32:01,502
Mr. Tauber, you and everybody
in this room can go to hell...

1121
01:32:01,585 --> 01:32:03,003
'cause I'm not testifying.

1122
01:32:03,086 --> 01:32:06,173
- Listen-
- Wait just a second, Frank.

1123
01:32:06,256 --> 01:32:08,592
You have nothing to fear.
You're not gonna be singled out.

1124
01:32:08,675 --> 01:32:11,011
I'm not afraid.
I don't give a fuck who knows...

1125
01:32:11,094 --> 01:32:12,846
- Wait a minute-
- if it meant something...

1126
01:32:12,930 --> 01:32:15,307
- but this investigation is bullshit.
- Mind if I say something?

1127
01:32:15,349 --> 01:32:18,101
Bullshit. You're not going after
corruption in the department...

1128
01:32:18,185 --> 01:32:19,895
the division, the Bronx.

1129
01:32:19,978 --> 01:32:21,897
A few flunky cops
thrown to the wolves...

1130
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:25,025
to protect Delaney and those guys
who've known about this for years...

1131
01:32:25,109 --> 01:32:27,986
and won't do a fuckin' thing about
it, that's why I won't testify.

1132
01:33:02,354 --> 01:33:06,608
- Hey, what's this?
- Exactly what it says.

1133
01:33:06,692 --> 01:33:08,277
I'm splitting.

1134
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:10,446
"Splitting." I never read
anything so stupid in my life.

1135
01:33:10,529 --> 01:33:13,866
"I'm leaving. If you want to
discuss it, I'll be at Felix's."

1136
01:33:13,907 --> 01:33:16,118
I didn't feel like another
blood-and-guts scene.

1137
01:33:16,201 --> 01:33:18,162
I figured you wouldn't
be able to shout in here.

1138
01:33:18,203 --> 01:33:20,289
I can shout anywhere!

1139
01:33:25,419 --> 01:33:27,379
I won't shout.

1140
01:33:29,006 --> 01:33:30,549
Sit down, sit down.

1141
01:33:43,854 --> 01:33:45,939
It's just gonna go on
and on, Paco.

1142
01:33:46,023 --> 01:33:48,108
It isn't gonna
get any better.

1143
01:33:49,735 --> 01:33:52,529
And if you quit,
somehow I'll be blamed.

1144
01:34:01,705 --> 01:34:03,832
How could you leave
the man you love...

1145
01:34:04,917 --> 01:34:07,002
future father of your kids?

1146
01:34:09,838 --> 01:34:12,466
You never said anything
like that to me before.

1147
01:34:14,134 --> 01:34:17,888
And if I come back,
you won't say it again.

1148
01:34:20,182 --> 01:34:23,685
You want to be free
and unattached...

1149
01:34:23,769 --> 01:34:27,189
to go on fighting for your cause
and keep torturing yourself.

1150
01:34:27,272 --> 01:34:28,690
My cause.

1151
01:34:33,862 --> 01:34:35,447
I felt so safe with you...

1152
01:34:36,824 --> 01:34:38,826
so loving.

1153
01:34:48,502 --> 01:34:49,920
Stay with me, Laurie.

1154
01:34:53,257 --> 01:34:55,175
- Come on. Stay with me.
- No, no.

1155
01:35:06,979 --> 01:35:10,441
- What do I owe you for that?
- Excuse me.

1156
01:35:10,524 --> 01:35:12,443
Here.

1157
01:35:12,526 --> 01:35:13,944
Here's $2:00.

1158
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:33,338
What are you doing?

1159
01:35:37,926 --> 01:35:39,386
Do you want to walk away,
or should I?

1160
01:35:41,221 --> 01:35:42,639
I'm not gonna walk away.

1161
01:35:44,850 --> 01:35:46,101
It's finished!

1162
01:35:54,109 --> 01:35:57,529
Who do you think you are, trying to
pull that "no testifying" bullshit on me?

1163
01:35:57,571 --> 01:36:01,366
Chief Green,
I know your reputation.

1164
01:36:01,450 --> 01:36:05,746
Look, maybe if you were borough
commanderwhen this thing started...

1165
01:36:05,788 --> 01:36:09,208
run this investigation yourself,
I'd feel different about testifying.

1166
01:36:09,249 --> 01:36:11,585
But the truth is,
you're coming in after the fact.

1167
01:36:11,668 --> 01:36:16,006
You're like a quiffwho says
she won't, then maybe she will.

1168
01:36:16,089 --> 01:36:18,675
I'm like a quiff
who's been fucked over...

1169
01:36:18,759 --> 01:36:22,679
for a year and a half by guys like
Kellogg, McCIain, Delaney...

1170
01:36:22,763 --> 01:36:25,682
I'm not Kellogg,
McCIain or Delaney!

1171
01:36:25,766 --> 01:36:28,560
Frank, it won't be
just flunky cops.

1172
01:36:28,644 --> 01:36:31,355
This is only the beginning.
This could be the biggest thing...

1173
01:36:31,438 --> 01:36:34,608
- since the Harry Gross case.
- And meanwhile, where am I?

1174
01:36:34,650 --> 01:36:37,152
I'm out there alone.
Who gives a fuck about that?

1175
01:36:37,236 --> 01:36:39,988
I'm totally isolated in the
department. I don't have a friend.

1176
01:36:40,072 --> 01:36:43,575
Don't give me that bullshit. I've
been puttin' cops away for 30 years!

1177
01:36:43,617 --> 01:36:47,079
My name's an obscenity on every
precinct shithouse wall in the city.

1178
01:36:47,162 --> 01:36:50,999
- I've observed that, sir.
- Friends! I fought my way up...

1179
01:36:51,083 --> 01:36:52,751
as a Jew in the department in the
days you were supposed to have...

1180
01:36:52,835 --> 01:36:55,546
an uncircumcised shamrock
between your legs.

1181
01:36:55,629 --> 01:36:57,464
I have this nightmare
I'm on 5th Avenue...

1182
01:36:57,548 --> 01:37:00,092
watching the St. Patrick's Day
parade and I have a coronary...

1183
01:37:00,175 --> 01:37:03,303
and 9,000 cops
march happily over my body.

1184
01:37:03,387 --> 01:37:06,306
Friends. I haven't got a friend
on the force, either, Serpico.

1185
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:08,767
- I'll be your friend, Chief.
- I'm not lookin' for any.

1186
01:37:08,809 --> 01:37:11,728
- I'll make an exception for you.
- Frank, you're a good cop.

1187
01:37:11,854 --> 01:37:14,940
Stop being a prima donna.
Cut out the shtickklech.

1188
01:37:15,023 --> 01:37:17,151
I don't understand.

1189
01:37:17,234 --> 01:37:19,194
How am I being a prima donna?
I want to protect myself.

1190
01:37:21,697 --> 01:37:25,367
We're gonna get the indictments.
You're gonna have to testify.

1191
01:37:33,459 --> 01:37:37,337
Ready on the right.
Ready on the left.

1192
01:37:37,379 --> 01:37:40,215
Ready on the firing line.

1193
01:38:29,389 --> 01:38:31,809
What are you gonna tell
the grand jury, Frankie?

1194
01:38:34,019 --> 01:38:36,146
Depends on
what they ask me.

1195
01:38:36,230 --> 01:38:38,690
Suppose they ask you
who's taking money?

1196
01:38:38,774 --> 01:38:41,026
What I don't know,
I don't know.

1197
01:38:41,110 --> 01:38:43,821
But you do know, Frank.

1198
01:38:43,904 --> 01:38:47,908
Look, Frankie, I like you. I don't
want to see anything happen to you.

1199
01:38:47,991 --> 01:38:52,329
But you gotta understand,
a lot of people could get hurt here.

1200
01:38:52,371 --> 01:38:55,958
I'm not saying anything's going to
happen. I'm saying it could happen.

1201
01:38:56,041 --> 01:38:58,836
I mean, there's lots ofways.
Nobody has to take a shot at you.

1202
01:38:58,877 --> 01:39:01,046
They can just not be there
when you need them.

1203
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:04,341
Somebody come at you with a gun,
they look the other way.

1204
01:39:04,424 --> 01:39:06,510
Or they can send you
in first enough times...

1205
01:39:06,593 --> 01:39:08,804
until finally one day you're gonna
walk in the wrong door.

1206
01:39:12,933 --> 01:39:15,310
- Thanks for the information.
- Fuck you, Frank!

1207
01:39:18,605 --> 01:39:21,191
I have nothing more. Does anyone
have any further questions?

1208
01:39:22,276 --> 01:39:24,528
- Yes, Mrs. Crist?
- If I may, Mr. Knowles, thank you.

1209
01:39:24,611 --> 01:39:27,281
Officer Serpico came
to the 7th Division...

1210
01:39:27,364 --> 01:39:29,283
more than a year
and a half ago.

1211
01:39:29,366 --> 01:39:32,703
All during that time, the things
he's told us were taking place.

1212
01:39:32,786 --> 01:39:35,456
Now, why didn't
Officer Serpico...

1213
01:39:35,539 --> 01:39:39,585
report these criminal activities
when he first encountered them?

1214
01:39:39,668 --> 01:39:42,838
- I'd like to answer that.
- Mr. Chairman...

1215
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:47,634
Mrs. Crist's question isn't material
or relevant to the present inquiry.

1216
01:39:47,718 --> 01:39:49,928
- Although I want to make it clear...
- I'd like to answer that.

1217
01:39:50,012 --> 01:39:53,599
Officer Serpico cannot be considered
derelict of his duty in any way...

1218
01:39:53,682 --> 01:39:55,976
or guilty of
any infraction of the law.

1219
01:39:56,059 --> 01:39:57,978
Quite the contrary.

1220
01:39:58,061 --> 01:40:01,565
The District Attorney is not prepared
to say any more at this time.

1221
01:40:01,648 --> 01:40:05,068
Very well. Officer Serpico,
thank you for your testimony.

1222
01:40:05,152 --> 01:40:08,155
This hearing is adjourned
until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

1223
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:12,701
Why didn't you tell him
about Delaney and Kellogg?

1224
01:40:12,785 --> 01:40:15,579
Frank, this was a grand jury
about police officers...

1225
01:40:15,662 --> 01:40:18,332
actively engaged in corruption.

1226
01:40:18,415 --> 01:40:21,043
You don't implicate people
without sufficient evidence.

1227
01:40:21,126 --> 01:40:25,088
That's crap and you know it, because
even a dumb cop like me knows...

1228
01:40:25,130 --> 01:40:28,717
a prosecutor can take a grand jury
anywhere it wants to take it.

1229
01:40:28,801 --> 01:40:31,512
Now, you never led me anywhere
near the real problems...

1230
01:40:31,553 --> 01:40:34,848
Nothing about the bosses,
the brass...

1231
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:37,768
how corruption like this could exist
without anybody knowing about it.

1232
01:40:37,851 --> 01:40:40,437
Now, a few flunky cops
in the Bronx. That's it.

1233
01:40:40,521 --> 01:40:43,190
None of the shit in Queens,
Brooklyn, Manhattan?

1234
01:40:43,273 --> 01:40:45,192
While you're at it,
why don't you mention Kansas City?

1235
01:40:45,234 --> 01:40:47,653
Well, "the biggest thing since
Harry Gross." That's what you said.

1236
01:40:47,736 --> 01:40:50,155
All right! Look, Frank.

1237
01:40:51,031 --> 01:40:53,992
You got guts, integrity.

1238
01:40:54,076 --> 01:40:57,037
There's going to be a detective's
gold shield in this for you.

1239
01:40:59,748 --> 01:41:03,210
Now, that's terrific.
That's good.

1240
01:41:03,293 --> 01:41:04,878
Maybe this is
what it's all about.

1241
01:41:04,962 --> 01:41:06,839
Maybe I should take my
gold shield and forget it.

1242
01:41:06,922 --> 01:41:09,216
I know you've been through
an ordeal, Frank.

1243
01:41:11,969 --> 01:41:15,472
I'm a marked man in this department.
For what?

1244
01:41:15,556 --> 01:41:18,892
- I've already arranged a transfer.
- To where? China?

1245
01:41:30,821 --> 01:41:33,574
That takes a 14-shot clip.

1246
01:41:33,657 --> 01:41:35,701
You expecting an army?

1247
01:41:35,742 --> 01:41:37,703
No, just a division.

1248
01:41:39,621 --> 01:41:44,168
Tauber, did you know I've had
reports about Serpico being a fag?

1249
01:41:44,251 --> 01:41:46,920
He used to hang out
in the BCI washroom.

1250
01:41:47,004 --> 01:41:50,215
That's stupid, Commissioner,
and you know it.

1251
01:41:50,299 --> 01:41:54,386
Mr. Commissioner, a gold shield
for Serpico at this time...

1252
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:56,054
would convince
a lot of people...

1253
01:41:56,138 --> 01:41:57,681
Not while I'm commissioner.

1254
01:42:16,909 --> 01:42:18,327
Commander's office?

1255
01:42:20,788 --> 01:42:22,748
It's down that corridor.

1256
01:42:25,709 --> 01:42:28,462
Hey, Serpico. Do you know what
they're saying in the Bronx?

1257
01:42:28,545 --> 01:42:31,423
That you spilled your
guts to the grand jury.

1258
01:42:32,424 --> 01:42:34,384
Say it isn't so, Serpico.

1259
01:42:36,553 --> 01:42:38,222
It isn't so.

1260
01:42:39,306 --> 01:42:41,391
We know how to handle
guys like you.

1261
01:42:42,643 --> 01:42:44,603
I ought to cut
your tongue out.

1262
01:42:50,442 --> 01:42:52,152
Don't move.

1263
01:43:14,258 --> 01:43:16,510
Officer Serpico
reporting for duty, sir.

1264
01:43:24,768 --> 01:43:27,771
I'm Inspector Lombardo.
I want to shake your hand, Frank.

1265
01:43:29,565 --> 01:43:31,775
It's gonna be nice to have
a guy here I can trust.

1266
01:43:33,527 --> 01:43:34,987
Anybody in this command
you want to work with?

1267
01:43:38,574 --> 01:43:42,286
It's not who I want to work with.
It's who wants to work with me.

1268
01:43:45,122 --> 01:43:48,709
All right. You can't find anybody
you want to work with, Frank...

1269
01:43:48,792 --> 01:43:51,003
I'll work with you.

1270
01:43:51,086 --> 01:43:53,005
Is that all right?

1271
01:44:03,724 --> 01:44:05,726
How do we get past
the lookouts?

1272
01:44:05,809 --> 01:44:07,519
How many you got?
One.

1273
01:44:10,063 --> 01:44:12,691
There's two.

1274
01:44:12,775 --> 01:44:15,569
- Yeah, there's a guy.
- There's three of them.

1275
01:44:15,652 --> 01:44:17,821
It's four buildings away. We could
try to get down the fire escape.

1276
01:44:17,905 --> 01:44:19,990
Get in behind him.
What do you think?

1277
01:44:21,617 --> 01:44:23,952
- Look good to you?
- Yeah, let's go.

1278
01:45:06,995 --> 01:45:09,081
What do you think?
Want to try it?

1279
01:45:27,558 --> 01:45:29,810
- Oh, boy.
- You all right?

1280
01:45:29,852 --> 01:45:31,812
Yeah. I feel just
like a cop again.

1281
01:45:31,854 --> 01:45:34,148
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

1282
01:46:02,551 --> 01:46:04,136
Close up!

1283
01:46:06,972 --> 01:46:08,974
Wait, Frank!

1284
01:46:09,057 --> 01:46:10,517
Come on!

1285
01:46:19,943 --> 01:46:21,361
I ain't got nothing!

1286
01:46:23,572 --> 01:46:25,532
Beat it, fuck face!

1287
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:30,162
Get the other one! Get out of here!
Get up against the wall.

1288
01:46:34,041 --> 01:46:36,335
What the hell's goin' on here?
Who the hell are you?

1289
01:46:36,376 --> 01:46:38,212
- Who are you?
- The police! Who the hell you think?

1290
01:46:38,295 --> 01:46:40,923
Get the fuck against the wall.
Up, up, up!

1291
01:46:41,006 --> 01:46:44,676
- Let me see your shield.
- All right. There's my shield.

1292
01:46:44,718 --> 01:46:47,387
- Where are you from?
- The borough. Manhattan 8th.

1293
01:46:47,471 --> 01:46:50,599
No, goddamn it! I just paid
the borough this morning!

1294
01:46:53,185 --> 01:46:54,853
What the hell kind of
shakedown is this?

1295
01:46:54,937 --> 01:46:57,022
Who'd you pay
in the borough?

1296
01:46:58,690 --> 01:47:01,193
Nobody.
I didn't pay no...

1297
01:47:01,235 --> 01:47:03,320
Who'd you pay
in the borough?

1298
01:47:03,403 --> 01:47:06,573
I didn't pay nobody.
Now let go of me.

1299
01:47:07,616 --> 01:47:12,204
We followed up,
and there's no doubt about it.

1300
01:47:12,287 --> 01:47:15,707
The pad here in Manhattan
is bigger...

1301
01:47:15,749 --> 01:47:20,504
and it's more sophisticated
than the one in the Bronx.

1302
01:47:20,587 --> 01:47:23,590
The pickups here are made-
You want to get this...

1303
01:47:23,674 --> 01:47:26,885
The pickups are made by...

1304
01:47:26,969 --> 01:47:29,847
retired policemen.

1305
01:47:29,888 --> 01:47:33,392
That way, no plainclothesmen
are directly involved.

1306
01:47:33,475 --> 01:47:37,729
Now, we need investigative help
on this one, Chief.

1307
01:47:39,565 --> 01:47:43,944
If you need investigative help
and you don't trust your own men...

1308
01:47:44,027 --> 01:47:47,030
why don't you requisition some
recruits from the police academy?

1309
01:47:55,330 --> 01:47:56,915
With all due respect,
sir...

1310
01:47:58,959 --> 01:48:01,879
backing us up is the only hope
the police department has got.

1311
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:05,591
Good cops would come forward if they
thought there was encouragement...

1312
01:48:05,674 --> 01:48:08,010
in the department to do so, and if
they thought it would do any good.

1313
01:48:08,051 --> 01:48:10,012
If there's no encouragement,
they're not gonna do it.

1314
01:48:10,095 --> 01:48:13,640
I've done a lot more than most
people to defend and preserve...

1315
01:48:13,724 --> 01:48:17,144
the image of this department
and protect Commissioner Delaney...

1316
01:48:17,227 --> 01:48:21,106
against reckless and irresponsible
assaults from outside agencies.

1317
01:48:23,025 --> 01:48:24,943
That's it, huh?

1318
01:48:25,027 --> 01:48:28,697
I mean, that's what's
really important, isn't it?

1319
01:48:28,739 --> 01:48:30,866
That's what
you want to know...

1320
01:48:30,949 --> 01:48:34,203
what outside agencies
I've been to, right?

1321
01:48:35,746 --> 01:48:37,498
- Hello.
- Hello, prick.

1322
01:48:37,581 --> 01:48:39,708
- Who is this?
- Frank.

1323
01:48:40,584 --> 01:48:43,545
- How are you? Where are you?
- I'm ready to go to the Times.

1324
01:48:44,505 --> 01:48:48,592
It's a goddamn
serious step, Frank.

1325
01:48:48,675 --> 01:48:51,261
I don't know if
the timing is right.

1326
01:48:53,972 --> 01:48:56,767
Look, I want it to get on
the record, that's all...

1327
01:48:56,850 --> 01:48:59,269
in case something
should happen to me.

1328
01:49:02,815 --> 01:49:04,900
I want it on the record.

1329
01:49:07,945 --> 01:49:09,363
I don't know ifwe
carry enough weight.

1330
01:49:11,031 --> 01:49:13,117
I don't know if the New York Times
will go that far out on a limb...

1331
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:15,452
on the say-so
of two flunky cops.

1332
01:49:19,748 --> 01:49:22,501
Suppose an inspector
were to come with us?

1333
01:49:24,128 --> 01:49:27,548
You know, I got 20 years
on the force.

1334
01:49:27,589 --> 01:49:31,927
Just bought this place.
I signed a 500-year mortgage on it.

1335
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:35,222
- Turn that thing off out there!
- Come on. Everybody to bed.

1336
01:49:35,305 --> 01:49:37,349
- Aw, Mom!
- Turn that damn thing down!

1337
01:49:37,432 --> 01:49:39,351
Come on, now.
Go on upstairs.

1338
01:49:39,435 --> 01:49:41,478
You said we could go
to bed late!

1339
01:49:43,147 --> 01:49:46,066
This is against department
regulations, you both know that.

1340
01:49:46,150 --> 01:49:50,446
If they want to throw the book
at me, they can do it.

1341
01:49:50,487 --> 01:49:52,573
If I left the force...

1342
01:49:53,949 --> 01:49:56,076
I don't know
what I could do.

1343
01:50:01,874 --> 01:50:05,794
Okay, I made my little speech.
I'll back you up a hundred percent.

1344
01:50:09,798 --> 01:50:13,010
Times and the News.
I got the money, fellas.

1345
01:50:13,093 --> 01:50:15,012
Here you go, here you go,
here you go.

1346
01:50:15,095 --> 01:50:16,513
Newsweek, please.

1347
01:50:18,932 --> 01:50:20,851
Holy sh- Jeez!

1348
01:50:23,187 --> 01:50:24,813
Aw, Christ!

1349
01:50:24,897 --> 01:50:27,775
You could almost predict
the numbers they're gonna do.

1350
01:50:27,816 --> 01:50:30,068
Delaney's gonna issue
some phony denial.

1351
01:50:30,152 --> 01:50:33,113
Somebody from the mayor's office
will say something noble.

1352
01:50:33,197 --> 01:50:37,826
Delaney'll change his tune. Finally,
the mayor will appoint a commission.

1353
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:41,079
"Mayor Lindsay announced the
formation of a five-man committee...

1354
01:50:41,163 --> 01:50:43,999
to review the city procedures for
investigating police corruption."

1355
01:50:44,082 --> 01:50:47,127
How come I'm not
in the first paragraph?

1356
01:50:47,211 --> 01:50:48,629
Unbelievable!

1357
01:50:52,925 --> 01:50:57,304
The Times' report smells
of the familiar smear tactics...

1358
01:50:57,387 --> 01:50:59,389
of McCarthyism.

1359
01:50:59,473 --> 01:51:03,936
- I have issued a statement-
- We here at city hall...

1360
01:51:04,019 --> 01:51:06,730
The mayor appointed a special
investigation commission...

1361
01:51:06,814 --> 01:51:08,732
to be headed
by Whitman Knapp.

1362
01:51:08,816 --> 01:51:10,234
Yeah, come.

1363
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:20,744
It's your reward. It's a transfer
to narcotics, Brooklyn South.

1364
01:51:20,828 --> 01:51:23,956
You're still in clothes. You get
a tin shield, not a gold one.

1365
01:51:28,752 --> 01:51:30,671
I miss you already, Frank.

1366
01:51:35,717 --> 01:51:38,929
Look, Frank...

1367
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:44,309
it's narcotics.

1368
01:51:44,393 --> 01:51:46,937
You be careful.

1369
01:51:46,979 --> 01:51:50,482
It's very easy to get hurt...

1370
01:51:52,025 --> 01:51:53,444
and to...

1371
01:51:55,028 --> 01:51:56,738
to be set up.

1372
01:52:38,781 --> 01:52:40,824
Get in.

1373
01:52:57,758 --> 01:52:59,843
You're not wired,
are you?

1374
01:53:00,969 --> 01:53:02,846
Okay, you cocksucker.

1375
01:53:04,348 --> 01:53:07,351
You might get by in the Bronx
with that kind of shit...

1376
01:53:07,434 --> 01:53:10,854
but down here,
800 a month is chicken feed.

1377
01:53:12,481 --> 01:53:15,234
Last week,
one dope dealer...

1378
01:53:15,317 --> 01:53:18,362
sent out these guys
making pickups.

1379
01:53:18,445 --> 01:53:20,948
40,000 each.

1380
01:53:21,031 --> 01:53:24,326
We let 'em collect it all,
and then hit 'em.

1381
01:53:24,409 --> 01:53:27,996
120,000 split four ways.

1382
01:53:29,039 --> 01:53:31,458
That's serious money.

1383
01:53:31,542 --> 01:53:35,087
And with that,
you don't fuck around.

1384
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:39,258
- I got the message.
- Good.

1385
01:53:40,050 --> 01:53:41,510
Now get the fuck out.

1386
01:53:48,183 --> 01:53:49,601
The guy's name is Limbo.

1387
01:53:49,685 --> 01:53:52,020
He just uses this place,
his girlfriend's brother's place.

1388
01:53:52,062 --> 01:53:54,648
He's a pusher- heroin.

1389
01:53:54,731 --> 01:53:56,984
- We'll drive around to the corner.
- Right.

1390
01:53:57,067 --> 01:54:00,737
You keep in sight out front. When
you spot somebody who's dirty...

1391
01:54:00,779 --> 01:54:02,865
take off your glasses
and wipe 'em.

1392
01:54:02,948 --> 01:54:05,492
- Got it?
- Right. Okay.

1393
01:55:13,852 --> 01:55:16,313
We stay around here very long,
we're gonna get spotted.

1394
01:55:16,396 --> 01:55:19,983
Well, Frank, why don't you
go up there and check it out?

1395
01:55:20,067 --> 01:55:23,362
- Why don't you?
- I got the wrong clothes.

1396
01:55:23,445 --> 01:55:26,156
I'll take you shopping.

1397
01:57:10,803 --> 01:57:12,262
Limbo.

1398
01:57:45,671 --> 01:57:47,422
Police. Freeze!

1399
01:57:47,506 --> 01:57:49,508
Police officer.
All right, up against the wall.

1400
01:57:49,591 --> 01:57:53,804
Get your hands up against that wall.
Get up. All right.

1401
01:57:53,887 --> 01:57:56,807
- Palms on the wall and spread 'em.
- Get those hands up!

1402
01:57:56,849 --> 01:57:58,934
- Come on. Spread 'em!
- Get your feet apart.

1403
01:57:59,977 --> 01:58:01,979
- I saw the buy.
- Let's get Limbo.Julio!

1404
01:58:02,062 --> 01:58:04,314
- You all right, baby?
- Yeah, yeah. I got 'em.

1405
01:59:08,378 --> 01:59:10,255
Police officer!

1406
01:59:20,390 --> 01:59:22,351
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

1407
01:59:23,352 --> 01:59:25,479
Go down the fire escape!

1408
01:59:41,662 --> 01:59:45,332
Police! Throw out your guns
and come out with your hands up!

1409
02:00:19,575 --> 02:00:22,744
- Wait. What do you got here?
- It's Mr. and Mrs. Serpico, sir.

1410
02:00:22,828 --> 02:00:24,746
Okay. Go ahead.

1411
02:00:30,043 --> 02:00:33,005
- Where's our son?
- They're bringing him from X-ray.

1412
02:00:33,088 --> 02:00:35,549
- We want to see him.
- Just a few minutes.

1413
02:01:03,660 --> 02:01:05,579
Mr. and Mrs. Serpico...

1414
02:01:05,662 --> 02:01:09,750
the news is better
than we expected.

1415
02:01:09,833 --> 02:01:14,129
Thank God the bullet
was a small caliber.

1416
02:01:14,213 --> 02:01:15,798
It didn't enter the brain...

1417
02:01:17,466 --> 02:01:19,551
or strike the spinal cord.

1418
02:01:21,053 --> 02:01:23,597
He's on the critical list...

1419
02:01:23,639 --> 02:01:26,850
but his condition
seems to be stable.

1420
02:01:28,185 --> 02:01:30,020
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.

1421
02:02:03,971 --> 02:02:07,141
Stay out of there.
Didn't they tell you?

1422
02:02:07,224 --> 02:02:08,684
What?

1423
02:02:08,767 --> 02:02:12,146
The word is, don't talk to him.
He's no fuckin' good.

1424
02:02:21,989 --> 02:02:24,616
- How you doing, kid?
- Hello, Sid.

1425
02:02:31,331 --> 02:02:33,292
How are you?

1426
02:02:36,462 --> 02:02:38,881
You wanna read my fan mail?

1427
02:02:38,964 --> 02:02:40,883
Sure.

1428
02:02:40,966 --> 02:02:43,051
You're a big shot now, huh?

1429
02:03:11,288 --> 02:03:14,875
I want you to get those
fucking cops away from my door.

1430
02:03:25,677 --> 02:03:29,264
The Knapp Commission likes you.
They want you to appear.

1431
02:03:29,348 --> 02:03:30,849
Naturally.

1432
02:03:35,687 --> 02:03:37,147
Heinemann and Julio
are cleared.

1433
02:03:37,189 --> 02:03:39,775
The three of you are up for
exceptional merit awards.

1434
02:03:41,318 --> 02:03:43,237
That's very funny.

1435
02:03:48,534 --> 02:03:50,994
That's very funny.

1436
02:03:52,246 --> 02:03:53,664
Francesco, you love me?

1437
02:03:55,999 --> 02:03:58,418
I always had a thing for you, Sid.
You know that.

1438
02:04:02,881 --> 02:04:04,967
Your gold shield's
come through.

1439
02:04:33,704 --> 02:04:35,664
What's this for?

1440
02:04:39,251 --> 02:04:41,962
For being an honest cop?

1441
02:04:44,339 --> 02:04:47,509
Or for being stupid enough
to get shot in the face?

1442
02:04:51,930 --> 02:04:54,892
You tell them
they can shove it.

1443
02:05:00,439 --> 02:05:02,316
I don't want it.

1444
02:05:41,230 --> 02:05:42,689
Oh, well.

1445
02:05:47,861 --> 02:05:50,447
Well, Frank,
the facts are these.

1446
02:05:50,531 --> 02:05:54,159
You'll have to stay on leave
of absence for a few months.

1447
02:05:54,201 --> 02:05:58,080
In all probability, the hearing
in your left ear won't come back.

1448
02:05:58,163 --> 02:06:00,791
Two bullet fragments are still
lodged there in the bony portion.

1449
02:06:00,874 --> 02:06:02,501
One is very close to
the carotid artery...

1450
02:06:02,543 --> 02:06:05,337
andyou'll have to be checkked
from time to time.

1451
02:06:05,379 --> 02:06:07,798
Your left side will
feel stiffioccasionally.

1452
02:06:08,966 --> 02:06:12,136
Once in a great while you may
experience some dizziness.

1453
02:06:12,219 --> 02:06:14,346
But in general,
you'll be okkay.

1454
02:06:32,781 --> 02:06:35,075
Through my appearance
here today...

1455
02:06:35,159 --> 02:06:38,162
I hope that police officers in
the future will not experience...

1456
02:06:38,245 --> 02:06:41,832
the same frustration and anxiety
that I was subjected to...

1457
02:06:41,915 --> 02:06:45,210
for the past five years
at the hands of my superiors...

1458
02:06:45,294 --> 02:06:48,213
because of my attempt
to report corruption.

1459
02:06:48,297 --> 02:06:53,051
I was made to feel that I had
burdened them with an unwanted task.

1460
02:06:53,135 --> 02:06:56,680
The problem is that the atmosphere
does not yet exist...

1461
02:06:56,764 --> 02:06:58,724
in which an honest police officer
can act...

1462
02:06:58,766 --> 02:07:03,437
without fear of ridicule
or reprisal from fellow officers.

1463
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:07,107
Police corruption cannot exist
unless it is at least tolerated...

1464
02:07:07,191 --> 02:07:09,318
at higher levels
in the department.

1465
02:07:09,401 --> 02:07:12,738
Therefore, the most important result
that can come from these hearings...

1466
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:16,909
is a conviction by police officers
that the department will change.

1467
02:07:17,743 --> 02:07:19,161
In order to ensure this...

1468
02:07:19,244 --> 02:07:22,206
an independent,
permanent investigative body...

1469
02:07:22,289 --> 02:07:26,084
dealing with police corruption,
like this commission, is essential.
