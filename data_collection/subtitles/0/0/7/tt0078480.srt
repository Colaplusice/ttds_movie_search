{225}{312}{y:i}Long ago, the great Frith made the world.
{471}{512}{y:i}He made all the stars...
{595}{653}{y:i}... and the world lived among the stars.
{821}{872}{y:i}Frith made all the animals and birds...
{890}{949}{y:i}... and, at first, made them all the same.
{981}{1082}{y:i}Now, among the animals was El-ahrairah,|{y:i}the Prince of Rabbits.
{1153}{1193}{y:i}He had many friends...
{1263}{1308}{y:i}... and they all ate grass together.
{1336}{1395}{y:i}After a time,|{y:i}the rabbits wandered everywhere...
{1403}{1456}{y:i}... multiplied, eating as they went.
{1614}{1656}{y:i}Then, Frith said to El-ahrairah:
{1675}{1762}{y:i}"Prince Rabbit, if you cannot|{y:i}control your people...
{1779}{1829}{y:i}"...I shall find ways to control them."
{1850}{1909}{y:i}El-ahrairah would not listen,|{y:i}and said to Frith:
{1927}{1995}{y:i}"My people are the strongest in the world."
{2049}{2139}{y:i}This angered Frith, so he determined|{y:i}to get the better of El-ahrairah.
{2159}{2226}{y:i}He gave a present|{y:i}to every animal and bird...
{2241}{2301}{y:i}... making each one different from the rest.
{2320}{2416}{y:i}When the fox came,|{y:i}and others like the dog and cat...
{2445}{2499}{y:i}... the hawk and weasel...
{2552}{2693}{y:i}... to each of them, Frith gave a desire|{y:i}to hunt and slay the children of El-ahrairah.
{3006}{3117}{y:i}El-ahrairah knew that Frith was|{y:i}too clever for him, and he was frightened.
{3124}{3194}{y:i}He had never before seen|{y:i}the Black Rabbit of Death.
{3323}{3441}{y:i}"My friend," said Frith,|{y:i}"have you seen El-ahrairah?
{3458}{3502}{y:i}"For I wish to give him a gift."
{3556}{3631}{y:i}"No, I have not seen him."
{3643}{3745}{y:i}So, Frith said,|{y:i}"Come out, and I will bless you instead."
{3762}{3843}{y:i}"No, I cannot. I am busy.|{y:i}The fox and weasel are coming.
{3858}{3929}{y:i}"If you want to bless me,|{y:i}you will have to bless my bottom. "
{3952}{4016}{y:i}"Very well. Be it so."
{4072}{4194}{y:i}And El-ahrairah's tail grew shining white,|{y:i}and it flashed like a star.
{4220}{4276}{y:i}And his back legs grew long and powerful.
{4330}{4421}{y:i}He tore across the hill|{y:i}faster than any creature in the world.
{4592}{4706}{y:i}"All the world will be your enemy,|{y:i}Prince with a Thousand Enemies.
{4737}{4819}{y:i}"And whenever they catch you,|{y:i}they will kill you.
{4904}{4962}{y:i}"But first, they must catch you...
{4970}{5040}{y:i}"...digger, listener, runner.
{5057}{5100}{y:i}"Prince with the swift warren.
{5169}{5236}{y:i}"Be cunning and full of tricks...
{5268}{5334}{y:i}"...and your people|{y:i}will never be destroyed. "
{7839}{7947}Along the edge of that wood, there.|Enjoyed many a game of play from it, too.
{7961}{8033}You can't hold back progress.|Shame, though.
{8062}{8148}It's gone 8:00, and I told Elizabeth|we'd go into Newbury this evening.
{8194}{8250}Old sun sets so late in summer,|it's morning before...
{9153}{9197}I think it's safe now, Fiver.
{9258}{9331}There's still something strange|about the warren this evening.
{9377}{9404}Is it dangerous?
{9429}{9473}It's not exactly danger. It's...
{9507}{9559}I don't know. Something oppressive.
{9578}{9659}Like thunder.|It seems safe enough now, though.
{9675}{9776}Come on, see if you can find me a cowslip.|If you can't, no one can.
{9936}{9999}- What's going on?|- It's only that runt, Fiver.
{10011}{10052}Jumping at bluebottles again.
{10314}{10390}- Come on. Hurry up.|- Fiver found it, Toadflax.
{10392}{10431}And we'll eat it.
{10433}{10499}Cowslip are for Owsla. You know that.
{10672}{10734}Tell you the truth,|I'm getting sick and tired of it.
{10741}{10810}Sometimes I feel like|clearing out of the warren altogether.
{10834}{10902}Never mind. Let's forget it,|and try to enjoy the evening.
{11683}{11701}Hazel?
{11722}{11793}Hazel, this is where it comes from.
{11838}{11921}I know now that terrible thing is coming.
{11925}{11973}- What do you mean?|- Look.
{12014}{12071}The field! The field!
{12090}{12190}- It's covered with blood!|- Blood? Don't be silly.
{12736}{12808}All right, Fiver. It's getting dark.
{12815}{12879}- We should get back to the burrow.|- Back to the burrow?
{12881}{12930}Lt'll come there. Don't think it won't.
{12949}{12977}It's all around us.
{12979}{13009}Now, stop it, Fiver.
{13061}{13113}We've got to go away from here. All of us.
{13115}{13199}- Go away? What, the whole warren?|- Yes, before it's too late.
{13210}{13240}You're being silly.
{13243}{13292}They'll think you're out of your mind.
{13295}{13392}You must listen to me, Hazel.|Something very bad is going to happen.
{13436}{13525}We'd better try and see the Chief Rabbit.|You can tell him about it.
{13533}{13592}I don't expect he'll like the idea at all.
{13709}{13766}We've got to go away from the warren!|All of us!
{13772}{13836}- Go away?|- Yes, before it's too late.
{13838}{13883}Is something wrong?
{13885}{13934}- What's the matter?|- Is there danger?
{14038}{14091}Come on. Let's find out what's happened.
{14230}{14303}- Hazel? It is Hazel, isn't it?|- It is.
{14313}{14390}- What are you doing here?|- We want to see the Chief Rabbit, Bigwig.
{14397}{14456}"We"? You mean|he wants to see him, too?
{14460}{14504}- Yes.|- I must.
{14511}{14612}- What's it all about?|- Bigwig? What do they want?
{14623}{14678}- They want to see the Chief Rabbit.|- What for?
{14680}{14720}- I have to...|- Send them away.
{14727}{14764}I'll take care of it, Holly.
{14779}{14862}Look, Bigwig, when have I ever asked|to see the Chief Rabbit before?
{14939}{14973}All right.
{15014}{15038}Wait here.
{15095}{15177}Excuse me, sir.|These two outskirts have asked to see you.
{15184}{15234}Is it all right if I bring them down?
{15257}{15347}Come on, then, though I'll probably get|my ears chewed off for this.
{15464}{15510}Now, Walnut.
{15540}{15616}- It is Walnut, isn't it?|- No, sir. Hazel.
{15710}{15808}I knew your mother well. And your friend?
{15825}{15901}- My brother, sir. Fiver.|- Well, then.
{15966}{16020}Now, do tell me how I can help you.
{16024}{16099}Well, he says there's a bad danger|coming to our warren.
{16120}{16152}A bad danger.
{16331}{16373}How very upsetting.
{16396}{16462}Now, what sort of danger, I wonder.
{16464}{16544}I don't know. But it's bad. It's so bad.
{16549}{16630}Well, now. What ought we to do?
{16632}{16733}- Go away. All of us. Now.|- Now? In May?
{16755}{16841}The mating season?|And where would we go to?
{16857}{16936}He's had these feelings before,|and he's been right again and again.
{16937}{16995}I shall have to consider this very carefully.
{17026}{17100}Perhaps we'll discuss it later,|in the summer.
{17118}{17162}We can't wait!
{17164}{17228}It's been good of you to come, Walnut.
{17379}{17404}Bigwig!
{17451}{17506}- Bigwig.|- Sir?
{17508}{17577}- What was that all about?|- Well, sir...
{17579}{17675}Your duty as an officer is|to protect this burrow.
{17681}{17741}- Yes, sir.|- Those two lunatics...
{17768}{17787}Yes, sir.
{17905}{17939}- Who's that?|- It's me.
{17945}{18009}- Dandelion?|- No, Blackberry.
{18053}{18116}Dandelion told me|you were leaving the warren tonight.
{18125}{18224}- Lf it's true, I'd like to come along.|- We'd like to come along, too.
{18225}{18297}- I don't much like the look of things.|- We must get everyone.
{18299}{18348}That Toadflax fellow followed me|down the run.
{18366}{18441}It could mean the Owsla|has been turned out tonight.
{18449}{18496}Then the sooner we're off, the better.
{19035}{19080}It's the Owsla. They're coming.
{19512}{19625}- There aren't many of you left, are there?|- Bigwig? Are you off duty?
{19633}{19742}Off duty, and likely to remain off.|I've left the Owsla.
{19766}{19832}Fiver, I've been thinking about|what you said.
{19917}{20009}- We're leaving.|- Leaving? All of you? Where to?
{20021}{20076}We don't know exactly. But we're going.
{20093}{20145}- You're all under arrest!|- Under arrest?
{20147}{20187}- What do you mean?|- What for?
{20189}{20242}Spreading dissension, inciting to mutiny.
{20249}{20306}- There's a bad danger coming.|- It's not good.
{20315}{20349}You'll all come with me.
{20365}{20388}Is he alone?
{20412}{20445}I am captain of Owsla.
{20466}{20545}Go, now, or we'll kill you.
{20554}{20589}It's you who'll be killed.
{20655}{20718}- Bigwig!|- Yes, you know me.
{20866}{20992}- He'll come back with the Owsla soon.|- Right. Well, I think I'll come with you.
{21838}{21879}Hazel, we'll have to stop here.
{21888}{21964}Fiver and that other half-size, we're all in.|They need to rest.
{21965}{21992}He's right, Hazel.
{22003}{22052}Look. Once we're beyond the woods...
{22053}{22124}...we'll really be clear of the Owsla.|We can rest then.
{22353}{22438}I've never been in a wood before, Hazel.|It looks dangerous.
{22503}{22532}Follow me.
{23834}{23858}A lendri!
{23893}{23912}This way.
{24049}{24155}- It had just killed. I saw blood on its lips.|- Lucky for us, it had.
{24174}{24223}Otherwise, it might have been quicker.
{24945}{25028}- We shall have to cross it.|- Cross it? Who's going to cross it?
{25033}{25116}- What do you want to cross it for?|- Are you sure about this?
{25129}{25225}Yes. But I don't think I can swim, Hazel.|I'm worn out.
{25233}{25306}- Pipkin is even worse off than me.|- We can't just sit here.
{25317}{25365}I know what we ought to be looking for.
{25379}{25458}A high, lonely place with dry soil...
{25475}{25591}...where we can see and hear all around,|and men hardly ever come.
{25853}{25919}- There's a dog loose in the wood.|- Well, that does it.
{25931}{25960}- A dog?|- Come on.
{25966}{26033}What do you think will happen|when he picks up our scent?
{26042}{26084}Those that can swim, swim.
{26096}{26160}The others will have to make out|the best they can.
{26167}{26200}That's not good enough.
{26207}{26275}We got into this together,|we'll get out of it together.
{26277}{26311}Hazel, look.
{26409}{26432}It floats.
{26444}{26494}That's it. That's it!
{26528}{26565}Fiver, get on, quickly.
{26793}{26855}Silver, Bigwig, get your nose under it.|Push it out.
{26877}{26901}Quickly!
{27335}{27359}Keep still!
{27489}{27530}- Are you all right?|- Of course.
{27630}{27684}That was a good idea of yours, Blackberry.
{27685}{27784}Yes. Let's try to remember it.|Might come in handy again.
{28472}{28540}- Does anyone know where we're going?|- Hazel does, I'm sure.
{28712}{28764}I've never seen anything like that before.
{28769}{28816}- The man-thing killed it.|- A man-thing?
{28829}{28875}A hrududu. It runs on it.
{28885}{28921}- The what?|- The hrududu.
{28945}{29000}- It runs on it?|- Yeah, faster than we can.
{29002}{29064}- It's dangerous, then. It could catch us.|- No, no.
{29066}{29134}It won't take any notice of us at all.|I'll show you.
{29147}{29172}Watch this.
{29277}{29322}See? It's not interested.
{29424}{29459}What are you waiting for?
{29473}{29516}Well? Come along, then.
{30077}{30112}They need to rest, Hazel.
{30129}{30158}Something up ahead.
{30206}{30251}A warm, friendly burrow, perhaps?
{30264}{30320}No, not a burrow. A field.
{30331}{30431}A great field of scented plants|that will cover us until we're rested.
{30433}{30487}You're beginning to|sound like a chief, Hazel.
{30505}{30555}- Hazel-rah.|- Hazel-rah?
{30558}{30615}That'll be the day I call him chief, that will.
{31667}{31698}Violet's gone.
{31831}{31869}We'd better keep moving.
{32529}{32600}We'll have to stop soon, Hazel.|They're frightened and tired.
{32613}{32687}Over there. We'll rest there.
{32710}{32757}Can't rest there. That's a man-place.
{32767}{32817}There are no men there now.
{33144}{33179}It looks all right.
{35537}{35584}What's happening back home, I wonder.
{35624}{35699}Think, when we lived in our own burrows:
{35719}{35815}Dry, soft, warm bodies.
{35841}{35947}- Now, look, we can't go on like this.|- It gets worse and worse the further we go.
{35985}{36017}Where are we going?
{36028}{36094}It won't be much longer.|Then we can all rest.
{36105}{36166}- How much longer?|- We never should have left.
{36169}{36259}- Suppose Fiver's all wrong?|- We want to go back and find out.
{36263}{36320}Go back? After all we've been through?
{36329}{36411}And probably get killed for wounding|Captain Holly, an Owsla officer?
{36415}{36517}- Talk sense, for Frith's sake.|- We must go on, until we reach the hills.
{36529}{36580}Those that go back will not...
{36617}{36641}Not safe...
{36768}{36831}I don't believe you know|where you're going.
{36838}{36907}Now, listen to me,|you bunch of mole-snouted, muckraking...
{37011}{37057}It looks like you've come a long way.
{37083}{37112}Do you live here?
{37137}{37207}Yes, this is our warren.
{37230}{37278}We need to stay here for a while.
{37298}{37357}Why not? We supposed you would.
{37377}{37488}But I don't think there are enough of you|to live very comfortably on your own.
{37497}{37550}There are enough of us|to protect ourselves.
{37557}{37584}Don't get upset.
{37597}{37640}Who are you? What do you want?
{37666}{37725}My name is Cowslip,|and I don't want anything.
{37726}{37763}Yeah, what about the others?
{37773}{37868}We have plenty of empty burrows,|if that's what you mean.
{37885}{37977}And now, if you'll excuse me,|I hate the rain.
{38103}{38134}Funny smell.
{38142}{38219}We ought to have nothing to do|with that Cowslip, or his warren.
{38246}{38285}It might be drier in there.
{38297}{38353}Whatever will he think of us|if we don't go in?
{38355}{38448}- I'll tell you. He'll think we're afraid.|- Afraid? Who's afraid?
{38453}{38488}He seemed friendly enough.
{38511}{38571}What has he got to gain|by asking us to join him?
{38583}{38632}We can't sit out here like fools.
{38642}{38684}Well, come along then.
{38764}{38821}They think I'm mad,|but you know I'm not...
{38831}{38872}...and you still won't listen.
{38932}{38955}Hazel?
{39051}{39083}Come along, Fiver.
{39405}{39452}There's that smell again.
{39469}{39539}It's almost like man.
{39657}{39735}Oh, it's you, is it? How nice.|I'm so glad you've come.
{39748}{39793}This is rather a big warren.
{39817}{39908}Yes. Please, help yourself to flayrah.
{39917}{40019}There are fresh roots here daily.|The man throws it up.
{40028}{40053}Man? What man?
{40091}{40157}A lot of the burrows are lying empty,|you know...
{40181}{40244}...so you're all welcome|to any that you choose.
{40262}{40297}Where are all the others?
{40333}{40399}Please, eat all you like.|We'll leave you to your...
{40482}{40516}Where are they all?
{40520}{40587}Where? Try asking Cowslip|"where" anything.
{40609}{40641}They seem sad.
{40679}{40728}Like trees in November.
{40747}{40815}Well, I still think we've made|a big change for the better.
{40830}{40909}Do you think the man puts the food|out there because of a kind heart?
{40948}{40980}It's not poison.
{41021}{41135}There's something unnatural|and evil and twisted about this place.
{41148}{41255}It feels like mist.
{41265}{41352}Like being deceived, and losing our way.
{41361}{41438}Some of us are gathering|and suggesting stories.
{41450}{41547}- We're hoping you'll tell one.|- Hazel can tell you about our adventures.
{41553}{41601}How we had the good luck to join you.
{41614}{41673}Surely, there's no harm in that.
{41738}{41810}Dandelion, why don't you tell us|the story of El-ahrairah?
{41812}{41934}El-ahrairah and his trickery don't really|mean very much to us, charming as it is.
{41941}{41984}Rabbits will always need tricks.
{41999}{42136}No, we need dignity,|and above all, the will to accept our fate.
{42161}{42231}As one of our poets is fond of saying,|if I may quote...
{42233}{42289}- Yes, of course.|- Please, do.
{42301}{42349}"Where are you going, stream?
{42370}{42397}"Far, far away.
{42432}{42471}"Take me with you, stream.
{42480}{42535}"Take me on your dark journey.
{42570}{42680}"Lord Frith, take me far away,|to the hearts of light.
{42717}{42797}"The silence. I give you my breath.
{42832}{42899}- "My life. The silence."|- I've had enough!
{43311}{43394}- Where are you going?|- Away, to the hills.
{43409}{43476}By yourself, alone? You'll die.
{43491}{43576}- You're closer to death than I.|- Determined to ruin it for us, aren't you?
{43587}{43602}No!
{43614}{43704}Me, me, me. All the time.|"But, I'm in a mist."
{43705}{43747}- Bigwig!|- "Everything's burnt!"
{43749}{43806}- No!|- "I've a funny feeling in my toe."
{43808}{43905}- No, no!|- I'm finished with you.
{43910}{43972}What's more,|I'm going to make sure everyone else is.
{44318}{44395}Bigwig, listen. You're in a snare. A snare.
{44408}{44468}Now, what did they tell you|in Owsla? Think.
{44503}{44562}No good biting wire.
{44589}{44688}Run to the warren and get the others.|Blackberry, Silver and Cowslip.
{44693}{44726}Be quick. He'll die.
{44730}{44788}Blackberry! Dandelion! Come quickly!
{44902}{44967}Come on. Hurry up. It's Bigwig.
{45045}{45095}He's still breathing. What can we do?
{45112}{45180}- We've got to loosen the wire somehow.|- Yes, but how?
{45182}{45253}- Is Cowslip coming? Maybe he knows.|- He wouldn't come.
{45254}{45320}- He told me to stop talking about it.|- He told you what?
{45322}{45401}This is it. The wire's on a peg.|We've got to dig it out.
{45407}{45466}The peg's narrower down there. It tapers.
{45473}{45511}I can't get my teeth into it.
{45521}{45553}Pipkin, you go in.
{45626}{45661}The splinters prick you.
{45677}{45765}It's hard to breathe.|The peg's nearly through.
{45783}{45809}Fiver, you go in.
{45824}{45859}I can't hear him breathing.
{45873}{45913}It's broken in two. It's free.
{46061}{46125}Bigwig, the peg's out. You're free.
{46162}{46192}I think he's gone.
{46220}{46263}We've got you out, Bigwig.
{46289}{46313}You're free.
{46348}{46400}- Bigwig, please don't die.|- It's no use.
{46401}{46427}We got you out.
{46457}{46496}What shall we do without him?
{46530}{46649}"My heart has joined the thousand,|for my friend stopped running today."
{46689}{46796}You pay for it. The food, the warren. But|no one must ever ask where anyone was...
{46798}{46876}...or speak of the wires.|The whole place is snared, everywhere.
{46885}{46952}- They left Bigwig to die.|- Silver's right.
{46954}{47048}Let's drive them out,|take their warren and live there ourselves.
{47049}{47104}- Yes.|- Back to the warren.
{47131}{47221}- Back to the warren.|- Embleer Frith, you fools!
{47223}{47325}That warren's nothing but a death hole.|Yes, let's help ourselves to a roof of bones.
{47329}{47358}Who killed them?
{47368}{47437}Bigwig! You're alive!
{47451}{47516}- Are you all right?|- We thought you were dead.
{47517}{47600}- Let him alone. Let him rest.|- I don't have to rest.
{47759}{47826}- What do we do now, Fiver?|- Go away from here.
{47861}{47919}Look. Look.
{47945}{48043}That's the place for us. High, lonely hills...
{48049}{48176}...where the wind and the sound carry,|and the ground's as dry as straw in a barn.
{48193}{48291}That's where we ought to be.|That's where we have to get to.
{49074}{49099}Pipkin.
{49135}{49159}Pipkin.
{49178}{49197}Pipkin!
{49257}{49309}Why don't we go|and look around the farm?
{49379}{49429}Farm, Hazel? What for?
{49459}{49540}- Cats and dogs.|- I've got a little plan.
{49563}{49622}- Will it be dangerous?|- Of course not.
{49649}{49701}- Is it safe?|- Of course.
{49729}{49784}- Let's all go.|- No.
{49806}{49867}Just you and me.
{50448}{50483}I think I see a dog.
{50496}{50551}Where? It's tied up.
{50573}{50649}Give it a wide berth. We don't want it|to wake up the whole farm.
{50861}{50902}{y:i}This is the BBC Home Service.
{50924}{50981}They are up. Hazel?
{50997}{51065}- Let's go back.|- Just a little further.
{51205}{51271}Rabbits. So, that's your secret plan.
{51283}{51344}I'm going inside to take a look around.
{51544}{51588}Is it safe in there?
{51597}{51655}Of course. You wait here.
{51696}{51753}- But if you see a cat...|- A cat?
{51778}{51838}- You will let me know at once, all right?|- Right.
{51957}{51980}I'm Hazel.
{52026}{52045}Hazel.
{52082}{52115}My name's Clover.
{52142}{52208}- Where do you come from?|- Far away.
{52234}{52286}My friends and I live as we please.
{52292}{52361}We eat grass, lie in the sun.
{52380}{52420}- Do you ever get out?|- Oh, yes.
{52439}{52505}Sometimes, a child takes us|out on the grass.
{52514}{52609}- Would you like to join us?|- Join you? But how?
{52619}{52651}How can we join you?
{52678}{52739}Hazel! There's a cat outside.
{52766}{52808}I must go back to my friends.
{52818}{52894}But we'll be back, and any of you|who wish can come along with us.
{52915}{52995}- Where is it?|- There. I think it smelt us.
{53013}{53058}- I'll get you away.|- Thank you.
{53084}{53141}- Just follow me closely.|- Yes.
{53178}{53235}- And run when I do.|- Run when you do.
{53313}{53396}You look hungry.|Rats getting too clever, I suppose.
{53420}{53464}I bet you can't run at all.
{53513}{53606}You pie-eyed, sauce-licking scrap-scraper.|Can you run?
{53613}{53642}You'll see.
{53657}{53688}I think not.
{54011}{54044}What's all that, then?
{54057}{54091}Tab? Tab!
{54111}{54188}Let them alone. Cruel thing.
{54969}{54990}What is it?
{55024}{55083}There's something coming up|the line of the hedge.
{55117}{55214}- Can you see it?|- I hear it. It's something big.
{55244}{55291}- A cat?|- I don't know.
{55394}{55419}Bigwig!
{55605}{55645}Quiet. I want to listen.
{55689}{55716}Bigwig!
{55746}{55779}Bigwig!
{55796}{55845}It's the Black Rabbit of Inl!
{55854}{55897}Don't talk like that.
{55905}{55961}We go by the will of the Black Rabbit.
{55981}{56065}- When he calls you, you have to go.|- Stay where you are.
{56117}{56180}- Who's there?|- All dead!
{56216}{56254}All gone!
{56355}{56388}It's Captain Holly!
{56445}{56534}- Holly, it's me, Bigwig.|- I found you.
{56574}{56607}I found you.
{56621}{56684}He's been hurt.|Look at that wound on his shoulder.
{56717}{56743}I remember you.
{56778}{56868}- You're the one that saw it coming.|- But what happened?
{56888}{56958}Our warren, destroyed.
{56969}{57021}{y:i}Destroyed? How?
{57041}{57104}{y:i}Men came. Filled in the burrows.
{57165}{57192}{y:i}Couldn't get out.
{57221}{57256}{y:i}There was a strange sound.
{57281}{57356}{y:i}You see, the air turned bad.
{57385}{57444}{y:i}Runs blocked with dead bodies.
{57474}{57503}{y:i}I couldn't get out.
{57535}{57567}{y:i}Everything turned mad.
{57593}{57644}{y:i}Warren, herbs, roots, grass...
{57663}{57720}{y:i}... all pushed into the earth.
{57815}{57875}- Men have always hated us.|- No.
{57905}{57976}They just destroyed the warren|because we were in their way.
{58001}{58064}They'll never rest|until they've spoiled the earth.
{58094}{58134}I tried to find you.
{58158}{58202}I wandered for days.
{58255}{58296}The Efrafans wouldn't let me go.
{58325}{58356}They ripped my ear.
{58384}{58407}Ripped it.
{58433}{58470}I tried to find you.
{58496}{58564}Efrafans? What's he talking about?
{58596}{58647}- Holly.|- Let him be.
{58666}{58696}He's had a bad time.
{58715}{58766}He can tell us about it when he's rested.
{59281}{59338}A young doe has a request, sire.
{59347}{59397}A doe wants to see me?
{59407}{59458}Says she represents a group, sire.
{59477}{59500}I see.
{59602}{59673}- Your name?|- Hyzenthlay, sir.
{59693}{59763}Don't be frightened. You're safe here.
{59837}{59863}Get on with it!
{59885}{59989}Sir, several of us proposed|an expedition to start...
{60023}{60069}...a new warren somewhere else.
{60071}{60146}- A new warren? Out of the question.|- But, you don't understand.
{60154}{60196}The system is breaking down.
{60221}{60248}Explain that.
{60249}{60304}We can't produce litters.|We're overcrowded.
{60306}{60345}I want no further discussion.
{60347}{60412}- We'll go as far as you like.|- Here or anywhere else.
{60526}{60551}Thank you, sir.
{60572}{60632}Campion, have her watched.
{61191}{61276}That's it, Hazel.|That's where we have to be.
{61684}{61728}Let me get this straight, Fiver.
{61741}{61815}- You want us to climb this, is that it?|- Yes!
{62431}{62458}Come on, Pipkin!
{62753}{62843}Come and look.|You can see the whole world!
{63109}{63169}I found a burrow, Hazel.|Under that beech hanger.
{63171}{63241}With a great hall|and no smell of death or disease.
{63252}{63293}Frith on the hills!
{63304}{63348}He made it all for us!
{63356}{63432}Frith may have made it, but Fiver found it.
{63875}{63957}- I've never seen anything like it.|- It's some kind of a bird.
{63965}{64000}Are you hurt?
{64099}{64135}Bigwig, I've got an idea.
{64137}{64219}- See if you can find some worms.|- Worms? Me, dig for worms?
{64221}{64264}What for, for Frith's sake?
{64277}{64332}I get up plenty soon.
{64365}{64453}- He's hurt and we want to help him.|- A bird? What for?
{64475}{64515}We help you.
{64525}{64559}Piss off!
{64587}{64652}What for help me?
{64663}{64700}What happened to you?
{64725}{64799}Damn cat jump me, farm cat.
{64806}{64842}We know her.
{64894}{64946}We take you to burrow.
{64953}{65072}Go away. Wing no good,|but I walk plenty good.
{65119}{65197}- Is long way?|- Where you come from?
{65199}{65273}From big water.
{65288}{65376}My home by big water.
{65448}{65480}We go.
{66186}{66283}I thought everything would be fine|once we got here, but it's not.
{66289}{66357}Because now we've got here,|I find it's not that simple.
{66359}{66445}What do you mean?|This place is as safe as Fiver said it was.
{66477}{66528}I think we've done very well for ourselves.
{66530}{66603}- But we don't have any does.|- Does?
{66609}{66633}Does.
{66639}{66696}Not one, and that means no kittens.
{66697}{66780}- And after we're gone, no warren.|- So that's why you went to that farm.
{66786}{66870}I thought we'd be able to get|some hutch rabbits to join us.
{66873}{66942}What's to be done then, Hazel?|Set off again?
{66953}{66975}And where?
{66977}{67050}There's not been a sniff|of another rabbit since we got here.
{67052}{67120}The bird, Kehaar.
{67135}{67203}We'll get the bird to search for us.
{67402}{67453}What home? This hole?
{67456}{67515}Where are mates? Where are chicks?
{67530}{67615}Mate make eggs, mate sit on eggs...
{67627}{67735}...hatch eggs, many eggs. We feed chick.
{67748}{67804}Egg robbers come, we fight.
{67913}{67973}You stupid bunnies!
{67982}{68023}You got no mates!
{68040}{68073}Where are mates?
{68081}{68122}Where are chicks?
{68140}{68184}Plenty trouble for you.
{68200}{68236}You need mates!
{68254}{68296}It's working, Hazel.
{68313}{68421}You got no brains. You no plan.|You need mate for plan.
{68435}{68459}Listen.
{68473}{68520}I got plan for you.
{68535}{68598}Wing better, I go fly.
{68616}{68656}Fly for you.
{68669}{68722}I find mates.
{68732}{68787}What a splendid idea, Kehaar!
{68807}{68900}How clever of you to think of it.|You very fine bird.
{68920}{68972}When will you be able to fly?
{68976}{69064}I fly any time. Stand back.
{69095}{69151}When I fly... Stand back.
{69228}{69272}I need room.
{69277}{69304}Wings good.
{69328}{69368}Feathers clean.
{69379}{69431}I soar!
{69435}{69477}I glide!
{69504}{69535}I circle.
{69881}{69940}Then, I soar!
{70690}{70758}Bigwig said you couldn't|make a friend out of him.
{70772}{70868}- He's probably gone back to that big water.|- I think you're right.
{70891}{70960}Blackberry, I want you to get Dandelion...
{70962}{71019}...and meet me here|after the others are asleep.
{71024}{71120}{y:i}- It's no good asking you not to go.|{y:i}- It'll be perfectly safe, Fiver.
{71137}{71182}{y:i}I'll take the greatest care.
{71518}{71537}Clover.
{71573}{71604}Clover!
{71614}{71639}Who's that?
{71648}{71707}It's me. We're back.
{71717}{71744}Hazel.
{71885}{71960}- What are you doing up there?|- I've come to let you out.
{71974}{72006}Will you come with us?
{72031}{72090}- We're all right here.|- Yes.
{72096}{72116}Good.
{73244}{73276}Come on.
{73341}{73377}Come on, move.
{73595}{73675}- Lucy's rabbits are out, look.|- Let's get them in, quick.
{73691}{73740}There's a wild rabbit, look.
{73757}{73787}There he goes.
{73822}{73859}Keep the torch on them.
{73907}{73964}I don't know, John,|whether you hit it or not.
{73978}{74038}- I reckon he's in those nettles.|- Have a look, then.
{74063}{74147}I hit him, all right.|That's blood down there, see?
{74149}{74220}I don't see him, my boy.|He might be a ways off.
{74224}{74259}I reckon you've lost him.
{74285}{74319}No, we ain't.
{75228}{75308}Fiver, there's been some trouble.
{75337}{75376}Hazel's been shot.
{75410}{75435}No.
{75468}{75517}The Black Rabbit serves Lord Frith...
{75553}{75617}...but he does no more|than his appointed task.
{75704}{75732}Hazel's not dead.
{80341}{80379}Perfect landing.
{80535}{80600}Hazel's been wounded.|The farm man shot him.
{80605}{80638}Come on, follow me.
{80677}{80699}Come on!
{80701}{80779}- You get black stones out?|- What do you mean?
{80780}{80863}Always with gun is coming|little black stones.
{80869}{80904}You never see?
{80916}{80978}Take out black stones, he get better.
{81037}{81074}Let me see leg.
{81121}{81155}Many stones.
{81163}{81217}Did you find anything on your flight?
{81277}{81329}- Efrafa.|- Can you guide us there?
{81331}{81376}Many rabbits.
{81425}{81460}Too many rabbits.
{81463}{81524}We wouldn't be enough|to fight one of their patrols.
{81526}{81553}What do you mean?
{81570}{81628}You see this? They did it to me.
{81653}{81743}It's an identification mark.|Tells you when you can be above ground.
{81745}{81816}- What do you mean? Who's to stop you?|- Their Owsla.
{81845}{81935}{y:i}Their chief is called Woundwort.|{y:i}General Woundwort.
{81946}{82019}{y:i}I don't think even you would|{y:i}match up to him, Bigwig.
{82021}{82101}{y:i}Under him are captains,|{y:i}each one in charge of a mark.
{82105}{82163}{y:i}If you're found above ground|{y:i}at the wrong time...
{82166}{82230}{y:i}... they take you before the council|{y:i}for punishment.
{82240}{82275}{y:i}Some of them must get away.
{82277}{82346}{y:i}They caught one trying to run away|{y:i}when I was there.
{82348}{82383}{y:i}Blackavar was his name.
{82385}{82473}{y:i}When they'd finished with him,|{y:i}both his ears were ripped to shreds...
{82475}{82530}{y:i}... worse than this one of mine.
{82539}{82657}{y:i}He was lucky not to have been killed.|{y:i}There was another one, a doe, Hyzenthlay.
{82659}{82711}{y:i}I couldn't have escaped without her help.
{82716}{82761}She wouldn't go without the others.
{82795}{82852}Then some might be persuaded to leave?
{82853}{82925}Yes, but you'd never get them|out of Efrafa.
{82940}{82968}You got out.
{82988}{83068}{y:i}Only because Lord Frith|{y:i}sent one of his great messengers.
{83402}{83446}{y:i}I didn't see what happened to them.
{83453}{83499}It must have cut them down.
{83501}{83573}It's not going to be easy,|but we don't have much choice.
{83575}{83677}- We'll start off as soon as I'm fit to travel.|- I don't like this idea of yours at all.
{83679}{83724}Holly, I want you to stay here.
{83726}{83790}You're known to them|and it could be dangerous for you.
{83792}{83869}I've been in Efrafa, and I tell you|you're making a bad mistake...
{83871}{83931}...that might very well get you all killed.
{84376}{84408}There's a homba.
{84432}{84479}No one move. Keep still, all of you.
{84728}{84802}- What's he up to?|- Trying to draw it off, I suppose.
{84883}{84921}Frith and Inl!
{84937}{84984}Come on, let's get out of here.
{84995}{85023}Come on, hurry!
{85024}{85084}- How? Aren't you wounded?|- No. Let's go!
{85173}{85249}- What was that all about?|- I just lost my head, Hazel.
{85254}{85332}I've been strung up all day,|thinking about Efrafa.
{85340}{85389}Anyway, I feel a lot better now.
{85391}{85442}Why did you cry out, if you're all right?
{85444}{85551}I didn't. I just stopped,|got ready to run really fast...
{85553}{85617}...when I bumped into|a group of rabbits, face to face.
{85619}{85715}I tried to warn them about the homba,|but all they did was try to stop me.
{85728}{85779}One of them said, "You stay here."
{85781}{85843}So I knocked him down, I had to,|and raced off.
{85845}{85952}- Next thing I heard was this squeal.|- So the homba got the other rabbit?
{85953}{86026}He must have.|After all, I led them right into it.
{86028}{86074}But I never saw what happened.
{86094}{86149}It's not to rest here, they come.
{86164}{86194}A patrol?
{86196}{86276}Yeah, is coming for find you, is go!
{86288}{86359}You go to river, ten days I find you.
{86361}{86447}All of you, under that bridge|unless you want your ears chewed off.
{86448}{86490}Yeah, come along.
{86496}{86543}By other side iron road.
{86551}{86644}I think maybe they no like|for go across iron road.
{86649}{86728}Hazel, you go on.|This may be my chance to get into Efrafa.
{86738}{86768}But it's too...
{86817}{86868}All right, take care.
{86874}{86946}Now, Kehaar will meet you tomorrow,|in that kale field.
{86952}{87000}Tell him what you've worked out.
{87006}{87100}Mr. Hazel, what wait for?
{87109}{87168}He's right, Hazel, you must go now.
{87172}{87258}We'll go down to the river and wait there|for you to tell us what to do.
{87260}{87339}I want you to find some way|to keep them from following us.
{87341}{87400}Go on now, before we're all caught!
{87732}{87821}It's a wide patrol. Be careful, Hyzenthlay.
{88506}{88603}Sir, we've picked up this hlessi|and brought him in.
{88613}{88668}- Who are you?|- My name is Bigwig.
{88669}{88707}"Bigwig, sir!"
{88730}{88800}- What were you doing?|- I've come to join Efrafa.
{88809}{88873}- Why?|- Surprised you ask...
{88908}{88927}...sir.
{88966}{89036}Is there anything odd|about wanting to join?
{89046}{89127}I'll ask the questions. What can you do?
{89148}{89190}I can run and fight.
{89210}{89278}- Fight, can you?|- I've been an officer in an Owsla.
{89332}{89380}So, you came to join us.
{89403}{89460}I thought you might have some use for me.
{89462}{89569}Well, for the time being,|you'll be assigned a post in the patrol.
{89589}{89644}You'll take orders from Captain Campion.
{89659}{89764}If you want a doe,|you have your choice here.
{89786}{89832}You're not an officer for nothing.
{89860}{89887}Thank you, sir.
{89947}{90033}You'll be identified by your mark.
{90313}{90370}Those Efrafans will be fast and savage.
{90386}{90440}I need to find a way|to get away from them.
{90441}{90524}If what Holly says is true,|we couldn't possibly stand and fight them.
{90547}{90593}Then we'll have to find another way.
{90676}{90727}What on earth is that, Kehaar?
{90762}{90786}Him fish.
{90808}{90873}Hazel, come and look at this.
{90883}{90914}What is it?
{90920}{91012}Is boat. Man make them go on water.
{91022}{91071}It floats, Hazel.
{91117}{91141}It floats.
{91500}{91551}Aren't you going to silflay?
{91563}{91616}I don't silflay at this time, sir.
{91641}{91705}Tell him why you're here, Blackavar.
{91755}{91805}Come here for the mark to...
{91807}{91867}I come here for the mark to see me...
{91869}{91946}...how I've been punished|for trying to leave the warren.
{91952}{92028}The council were merciful.
{92071}{92122}He keeps trying to run away.
{92132}{92194}Captain Campion caught him this time.
{92206}{92264}His ears were ripped|and he is to show himself...
{92266}{92358}...at every morning and evening silflay|as an example to the others.
{92387}{92459}If you ask me, he won't last much longer.
{92474}{92564}He'll meet a blacker rabbit|than himself one of these nights.
{92592}{92655}That doe over there, what's her name?
{92684}{92726}Fancy her, do you?
{92770}{92903}She's called Hyzenthlay,|but look elsewhere, she's a troublemaker.
{92920}{92978}The council's got their eye on her.
{93178}{93223}You go now, talk to Bigwig.
{93233}{93316}Yeah, I go talk to Mr. Bigwig.
{93327}{93421}He'll be in field by arch on the iron road.|Go find him.
{93432}{93532}By the iron road? Yeah, I go and find him.
{93539}{93580}He'll tell you the plan.
{93586}{93685}He tell me the plan? I know the plan!
{93687}{93738}Now don't attract attention.
{93748}{93806}Of course not, of course not.
{93820}{93874}I be quiet. I be clever.
{93882}{93969}They no see me. Kehaar, Kehaar.
{93982}{94034}You wait here.
{94400}{94444}- Hyzenthlay.|- Sir?
{94487}{94521}I want to talk with you.
{94534}{94586}I am in the mark|and under your orders, sir.
{94592}{94680}Do you remember a pale gray rabbit|called Holly, you helped escape?
{94733}{94827}- You've made a mistake, sir.|- Listen, Hyzenthlay, listen carefully.
{94828}{94919}I'm from a warren where life is free,|where you can live as you wish.
{94931}{95020}I've come to bring you out of Efrafa,|as many as will come.
{95056}{95112}You might be a spy, sent by the council.
{95113}{95159}You know I'm not.
{95166}{95228}Will you join us,|and persuade your friends, as well?
{95230}{95308}Trust me. My friends are not far away.
{95352}{95435}My courage,|my spirit is so much less than it was.
{95445}{95508}We can escape from Efrafa, believe me.
{95548}{95579}Yes.
{95593}{95617}I think I do.
{95880}{95937}- Listen carefully.|- Yeah!
{95997}{96055}We're ready. We leave at sunset.
{96087}{96120}Ready good!
{96148}{96228}There will be lots of us.|We'll meet you at the iron bridge.
{96230}{96279}- When?|- Sunset.
{96288}{96361}Good! Good. Sunset.
{96367}{96420}Then you must guide us to the river.
{96476}{96544}- Plenty good trick.|- Trick, what trick?
{96642}{96746}Listen, if you see a patrol following us|you must drive them away, terrify them.
{96749}{96817}Yeah, I fly at them.
{96892}{96941}Remember: Sunset.
{96999}{97048}You plenty good fellow.
{97441}{97466}It's set.
{97474}{97492}When?
{97493}{97594}Get them to the near hind mark at sunset,|just before early silflay.
{97680}{97765}- Suppose something happens?|- Nothing will happen. We can do it.
{97772}{97796}Yes.
{97813}{97840}I think we can.
{97876}{97941}Sometimes I can tell when things are true.
{97950}{98008}Sometimes I can see it.
{98036}{98084}A high down with trees in it.
{98124}{98157}I've become foolish.
{98163}{98240}You'll have to meet this friend of mine.|He talks just like that.
{98241}{98272}We'll be ready.
{98276}{98338}Sunset, then. And a bird will fight for us.
{98378}{98450}- A bird?|- Even Woundwort won't expect that.
{98769}{98788}Bigwig!
{98813}{98884}That white bird|you were talking to this morning...
{98886}{98969}- Talking to, sir?|- You were very close to it. Why?
{98992}{99092}Well, I've never been hurt by a bird.
{99105}{99148}That's not what I asked.
{99166}{99252}To tell you the truth, sir,|I think I was trying to impress you.
{99264}{99344}In future, stay in your own mark.
{99359}{99380}Sir.
{99397}{99476}One more thing:|What do you know about a homba?
{99495}{99581}- A homba, sir?|- You led it onto some rabbits?
{99585}{99646}I didn't intend to.|I didn't know they were there.
{99648}{99691}You didn't report it.
{99702}{99778}Everything out of the ordinary|is to be reported.
{99784}{99859}I didn't know running from a homba|was out of the ordinary.
{99890}{99972}That was a patrol|on the track of a band of strangers.
{99982}{100025}Do you know anything about them?
{100027}{100112}I saw some tracks,|but I can't tell you anymore than that, sir.
{100124}{100191}I'm taking out a wide patrol tomorrow.
{100214}{100296}We'll cross the iron road|and try to pick up their tracks.
{100314}{100356}I want you to come along.
{100417}{100448}Yes, sir.
{100487}{100542}Campion, follow him.
{100570}{100625}Don't let him out of your sight.
{101054}{101138}I've been told to tell you early silflay|has been canceled this evening.
{101140}{101206}No one told me anything about it.
{101208}{101260}Have a look over there and you'll see why.
{101356}{101399}Now, Blackavar.
{101792}{101848}The new officer, sir, he's gone.
{101857}{101886}Bigwig?
{101891}{101975}He's wounded Sherbil|and taken a crowd of the mark with him.
{102039}{102112}I'll blind him. I'll blind him!
{102907}{102982}- Bigwig, where's the bird?|- He'll be here.
{102984}{103007}He'd better!
{103101}{103137}Where is that bird?
{103176}{103271}What I am doing here?|I am wait for long time.
{103301}{103395}Is no sunset. Is no good here.
{103514}{103589}Where are they?|They should be here by now.
{103615}{103697}Silver, go up to the iron bridge|and see if you can find them.
{103975}{104001}They're coming.
{104007}{104088}Bigwig, the general!
{104097}{104124}What will we do?
{104195}{104236}It nearly came off.
{104246}{104314}We'll take one or two of them with us|before it's finished.
{104316}{104340}Bigwig?
{104384}{104411}You traitors!
{104424}{104496}Campion, get this miserable group|back to their marks.
{104504}{104558}I'll settle with you myself, Bigwig.
{104565}{104600}No need to take you back.
{104602}{104668}Come on and try,|you crack-brained slave driver.
{104867}{104895}Kehaar!
{104916}{104946}Get away, blast you!
{104993}{105061}Get away, you damned white bird!
{105371}{105424}Straight ahead, to the river.
{105456}{105505}Keep going, it's a friend.
{105549}{105635}- You did it, Bigwig. You did it.|- I did, didn't I?
{105679}{105709}It's not over yet.
{105866}{105898}They gone.
{106037}{106091}Keep going, down to the river.
{106143}{106210}- The general's behind me.|- Where do we go, Hazel?
{106248}{106300}I trusted you, Bigwig.
{106318}{106361}You can trust me now.
{106379}{106456}You'll either go into the river|or be torn to pieces.
{106470}{106519}There's nowhere left to run.
{106563}{106600}Campion, Lily...
{106616}{106687}...when I give the word,|we go straight into them.
{106708}{106772}- That bird can't save you now.|- There it is!
{107552}{107615}What you do now?
{107621}{107684}We're going back to our warren, Kehaar.
{107692}{107777}Good. You go, I go.
{107789}{107857}Is finish here for me.
{107896}{108025}- I go to big water!|- Take care of that wing.
{108066}{108146}Is winter plenty cold, then I come back.
{108160}{108246}Come back anytime.|And thank you, Kehaar.
{108340}{108398}Big water!
{109364}{109398}Get the holes filled in.
{109429}{109471}Everyone underground.
{109476}{109520}- What's the matter?|- The general.
{109523}{109563}- Where?|- The wood behind us.
{109564}{109616}- It's full of Efrafans.|- I'm not going back.
{109618}{109683}- Maybe we ought to leave.|- Anyone who wants to can go.
{109688}{109758}We went through a lot to get here,|and I'm not leaving now.
{109760}{109789}Neither am I.
{109791}{109872}If I'm for the Black Rabbit,|one or two from Efrafa will come with me.
{109873}{109946}We'll fill in the holes deep.|They'll have to dig us out.
{109948}{110013}They can't be out there long|without attracting elil.
{110015}{110110}- The Efrafans will never give up.|- Maybe we should leave.
{110112}{110171}We're staying.|But there may be a better way.
{110177}{110238}- Let me come with you.|- No, they know you too well.
{110240}{110330}I'll go alone. Now, get those holes filled in.|I won't be long.
{110484}{110567}They'll take us back to Efrafa.|Their Owsla will.
{110569}{110649}Listen, we're not finished yet,|not by a long shot.
{110782}{110831}You were one of those on the riverbank.
{110844}{110873}Did Bigwig send you?
{110894}{110931}I'm a friend of Bigwig's.
{110941}{111029}What was left unfinished|on the riverbank will be finished now.
{111046}{111119}It would be better for both of us|if we could come to terms.
{111121}{111149}Terms?
{111168}{111191}Very well.
{111218}{111319}These are my terms.|Hand over all the deserters immediately.
{111320}{111364}We couldn't agree to that.
{111366}{111433}But I can suggest something better,|for both of us.
{111452}{111543}- You're in no position to bargain.|- We shouldn't be fighting each other.
{111544}{111588}We have enough enemies as it is.
{111590}{111692}Perhaps we should be together.|A joining of free, independent warrens.
{111775}{111827}I have no time for this nonsense.
{111839}{111893}- Shall I kill him, sir?|- No.
{111928}{111972}You take back our terms.
{112003}{112075}And you tell your chief, Bigwig,|that if he and Hyzenthlay...
{112077}{112152}...and the others aren't waiting outside|when I come for them...
{112154}{112206}...l'll tear out every throat in the place.
{112214}{112292}Do you remember the rats in the barn?|We got out of that, all right.
{112294}{112363}Yes, we did. We got out of that, all right.
{112726}{112783}They're into the beech roots.|Start at this end.
{112921}{113007}- How cold!|- What is it? Are you all right?
{113032}{113110}I've tried to listen, only I can't hear it.
{113127}{113199}I'm going away, Hazel. I'm floating.
{113254}{113349}- Cold, how...|- Fiver. Fiver.
{113368}{113416}- Can you hear me?|- Listen.
{113502}{113558}They have something down there|that's strange.
{113596}{113627}Get out, get out!
{113650}{113735}They had a great bird|that turned into a shaft of lightning.
{113761}{113847}And there was another creature|that took them away down the river.
{113852}{113939}- Here, I reckon we ought to go back home.|- Who said that?
{113941}{114032}- Nobody, sir.|- You were put there to dig. Get back to it.
{114045}{114140}Great Frith, stop him, Hazel.|The others are going tharn.
{114142}{114216}Wake up. Fiver, wake up.
{114255}{114297}There's a dog loose in the wood.
{114340}{114387}There's a dog loose in the wood.
{114409}{114503}{y:i}"We need to cross|{y:i}because there's a dog loose in the wood."
{114504}{114591}{y:i}"There's a dog loose in the wood."
{114614}{114678}Bigwig, I need runners.|Dandelion, Blackberry.
{114681}{114710}Hyzenthlay can run.
{114712}{114770}Good. We've hardly any time.|I've got a plan.
{114776}{114833}If it works,|it will finish Woundwort for good.
{114835}{114919}When we're gone, block this run|and get everyone back behind the wall.
{114920}{114973}Hold them off as long as you can.
{114975}{115035}- Don't give in to them.|- Where are you going?
{115037}{115085}El-ahrairah will show me what to do.
{115116}{115192}Let them go.|It's their chief, Bigwig, I'm after.
{115212}{115239}Find their chief!
{115660}{115702}Hyzenthlay, you hide here.
{115707}{115768}When the time comes,|get back to the warren.
{115770}{115848}- It will all depend on you.|- I'll be ready.
{115914}{116003}{y:i}Lord Frith,|{y:i}I know you've looked after us well...
{116005}{116059}{y:i}... and it's wrong to ask even more of you...
{116070}{116132}{y:i}... but my people are in terrible danger.
{116139}{116245}{y:i}So, I'd like to make a bargain with you:|{y:i}My life in return for theirs.
{116273}{116377}{y:i}There is not a day or night|{y:i}that a doe offers her life for her kittens...
{116379}{116468}{y:i}... or some honest captain of Owsla,|{y:i}his life for his chief.
{116487}{116601}{y:i}But there is no bargain.|{y:i}What is, is what must be.
{116653}{116710}Blackberry, this is where we leave you.
{116713}{116777}Stay close and don't move.|Don't break too soon.
{116779}{116834}- Are you clear what's to be done?|- Yes.
{117839}{117920}You lie in the grass,|just there, opposite him.
{117936}{117981}If we meet again, Hazel-rah...
{117985}{118044}...we'll have the makings|of the best story ever.
{118046}{118096}And you'll be the one to tell it.
{119240}{119291}Can you run?
{119322}{119371}I think not.
{119415}{119480}I think not.
{119530}{119572}Tab! Tab!
{120904}{120972}I told you once,|I was trying to impress you.
{120978}{121014}I hope I have.
{121020}{121090}And I told you that I would kill you myself.
{121096}{121147}There's no white bird here, Bigwig.
{122155}{122203}Why throw your life away?
{122229}{122283}Hraka, sir.
{122292}{122311}Come out.
{122367}{122419}My chief's told me to defend this run.
{122423}{122483}Your chief?
{122499}{122580}Run! Run for your lives!
{123000}{123060}Come back! Come back, you fools!
{123110}{123192}Come back and fight!|Dogs aren't dangerous!
{123521}{123587}{y:i}General Woundwort's body|{y:i}was never found.
{123640}{123726}{y:i}It could be that he still lives his fierce life|{y:i}somewhere else.
{123737}{123820}{y:i}But from that day on,|{y:i}mother rabbits would tell their kittens...
{123821}{123883}{y:i}... that if they did not do|{y:i}as they were told...
{123884}{123931}{y:i}... the General would get them.
{123936}{123989}{y:i}Such was Woundwort's monument.
{124009}{124080}{y:i}Perhaps it would not have displeased him.
{124383}{124472}{y:i}El-ahrairah knew, then,|{y:i}that Frith was his friend.
{124500}{124590}{y:i}Every evening,|{y:i}when Frith has done his day's work...
{124596}{124665}{y:i}... and lies calm and easy in the red sky...
{124684}{124788}{y:i}... El-ahrairah and his children,|{y:i}and his children's children...
{124797}{124896}{y:i}... come out of their holes|{y:i}and feed and play in his sight.
{124919}{124983}{y:i}For they are his friends,|{y:i}and he has promised...
{124984}{125008}{y:i}Hazel.
