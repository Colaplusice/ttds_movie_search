1
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,442
You all right?

2
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:28,025
Shit's really hitting the fan.

3
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:30,108
<i>FOSTER: [ON TV]:
What difference does it make?</i>

4
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:32,483
<i>-That's a different study.
BERMAN [ON TV]: But if we knew that-</i>

5
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,233
<i>FOSTER [ON TV]: We don't know that.
We don't know that.</i>

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,400
<i>We've gotta operate
on what we do know.</i>

7
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:39,150
I'm still dreaming.

8
00:00:39,317 --> 00:00:40,692
No, you're not.

9
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:44,275
<i>FOSTER [ON TV]: It's human beings
whose lives we're trying to save.</i>

10
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,983
My turn with the coat.

11
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,067
<i>FOSTER [ON TV]:
I try to explain several times.</i>

12
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:50,192
The guys on the crew are going crazy.

13
00:00:50,358 --> 00:00:52,983
A couple of them
have flown the coop already.

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,067
I don't know how long
we're gonna stay on the air.

15
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:02,942
Who's on camera?
Who the hell's on camera?

16
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:05,067
Who the hell's on camera two,
a blind man?

17
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:10,192
Roll the rescue-
Roll the rescue stations.

18
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:13,442
We just got a report that half those
stations have been knocked out.

19
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:14,608
Get me another list.

20
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,400
Sure, I'll just pull it out of my ass, right?

21
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,567
<i>-Believe the dead are returning to life?
-I'm not--</i>

22
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:22,400
You believe the dead are returning
to life and attacking the living?

23
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:24,233
I'm not so sure what to believe, doctor.

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,067
All we get is what you people tell us,
it's hard enough to believe--

25
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:28,233
It's fact. It's fact.

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,567
It's hard enough to believe
without you coming in here-

27
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:33,317
You're not running a talk show here,
Mr. Berman.

28
00:01:33,483 --> 00:01:36,942
You can forget pitching an audience
the moral bullshit they wanna hear.

29
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:39,567
<i>BERMAN [ON TV]: You're talking about
abandoning human....</i>

30
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:47,442
Frannie, get the list of rescue stations.
Charlie's receiving on the emergencies.

31
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,442
Rescue stations?

32
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:51,483
Half of those are inoperative as of now.

33
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,108
Charlie, these are rescue stations.

34
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:55,483
We can't send people
in inoperative rescue stations.

35
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,608
We've had old information on the air
for the last 12 hours.

36
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:14,108
-Kill those old ones.
-Givens wants them.

37
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:17,317
Kill them, Dick. Tell Givens to see me.

38
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,358
FOSTER:
You have not listened.

39
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:26,817
You have not listened in the situation
for three weeks.

40
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:28,233
What does it take?

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,442
What does it take to make people see?

42
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,733
People aren't willing to accept
your solutions, doctor.

43
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,275
And I, for one, don't blame them.

44
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:39,650
Every dead body that is not exterminated
becomes one of them.

45
00:02:39,817 --> 00:02:41,650
It gets up and kills.

46
00:02:41,817 --> 00:02:44,483
The people it kills get up and kill.

47
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,400
Operative rescue stations.

48
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:50,275
Dan!

49
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:56,650
Yeah, that's the one, kid. Type that up.

50
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:00,817
They're dropping like flies.
I think Foster's right. We're losing it.

51
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:02,358
We're blowing it ourselves.

52
00:03:05,035 --> 00:03:09,000
The dead body must be exterminated
either by destroying the brain...

53
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:11,540
...or severing the brain
from the rest of the body.

54
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,500
The situation must be controlled...
before it is too late

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,800
too rapidly

56
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,725
What's going on?
Who killed those supers?

57
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:24,183
I didn't order to do that.

58
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,433
Garrett, who told you
to kill those supers?

59
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,767
Nobody, I killed them.
They're out of date.

60
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,892
-Do you know you're on the air?
-What is going on?

61
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:33,475
I want those supers on the air
all the time.

62
00:03:33,642 --> 00:03:37,600
Without those rescue situations on-screen
every minute, people won't watch us.

63
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:38,850
They'll tune out.

64
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:41,433
You willing to murder people
by sending them to stations...

65
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,642
...that have closed down?

66
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:45,850
I want that list up on the screen
every minute that we're on the air.

67
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,350
LUCAS: Anybody need a ride?
-What the hell are you doing?

68
00:03:48,517 --> 00:03:49,767
Get back here on this console.

69
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,100
What is this, the news show
or a football game?

70
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:54,267
Get that idiot off the air!

71
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:57,350
This is supposed to be a doggone
news television show!

72
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:59,225
Officer, stop those men.

73
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:02,017
Lucas, get back here on the console!

74
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:03,933
Damn.

75
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:06,933
Get somebody in here
who can run this thing.

76
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,725
Get that fucking idiot off the air!

77
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:11,225
Get someone. Triple pay!

78
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,267
We're staying on the air!

79
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,808
My God. Turn it off!

80
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:18,725
Dr. Foster, so what's the facts?
The public needs facts.

81
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,017
What do you have to give us?

82
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:23,350
They kill for one reason.
They kill for food.

83
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:25,767
They eat their victims.
Do you understand that, Mr. Berman?

84
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,350
That's what keeps them going.

85
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:31,850
If we'd listened, if we'd dealt
with this phenomenon properly...

86
00:04:32,017 --> 00:04:37,308
...without emotion, without emotion,
it wouldn't have come to this.

87
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:41,183
There is a martial law state
in effect in Philadelphia...

88
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,058
...as in all other major cities
in the country,

89
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:48,558
Hold it, friend. Need a badge.

90
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:49,725
Hey, what's going on?

91
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:51,058
It's just crazy.

92
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:58,600
Here.

93
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,230
Should we be unable to check this threat...

94
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:04,100
beacuse of the emotional attitude of the citizens

95
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Jim, you take it.

96
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:11,384
It is the order of the OEP by command
of the federal government...

97
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,550
...the president of the United States.

98
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:17,884
Citizens may no longer occupy
private residences...

99
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,967
...no matter how safely protected
or well-stocked.

100
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,305
Citizens will be moved in the central areas of the city.

101
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:28,930
The bodies of the dead
will be delivered over...

102
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:31,680
...to specially equipped squads
of the national guard......

103
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:40,100
Frannie, meet me on the roof at 9:00.
We're getting out.

104
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,100
-I don't believe this, what...?
-Get out in the chopper.

105
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,000
David, we can't, we've got.....

106
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,000
Is 9 p.m. all right?

107
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:50,850
-Stephen, we can't. We've got to-
-We've got to nothing, Fran.

108
00:05:51,252 --> 00:05:53,380
We've got to survive.
Somebody's got to survive.

109
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,800
Now, you be upstairs at 9:00,
and don't make me come looking for you.

110
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,850
Go ahead. We'll be off the air
by midnight anyway.

111
00:05:59,851 --> 00:06:01,360
The emergency networks
are taking over.

112
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:05,760
Our responsibility is finished.

113
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,280
POLICE CHIEF: Martinez.

114
00:06:18,123 --> 00:06:21,290
You know we've got this building
surrounded.

115
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,748
Little bastard's got them moved
into one building. Dumb little bastard.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,292
-Come on.
POLICE CHIEF: Martinez.

117
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,750

POLICE CHIEF: There were no charges
against you or any of your people.

125
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:54,075
Yet.

126
00:06:55,075 --> 00:06:56,450
Come on, Martinez,

127
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,950
Yeah, Martinez,
show your greasy little Puerto Rican ass...

128
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:00,367
...so I can blow it right off.

129
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:04,200
Blow all their asses off,
lowlife bastards.

130
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:09,033
Blow all their lowlife little Puerto Rican
and nigger asses right off,

00:07:09,783 --> 00:07:11,283
-You're Rod, right?
-Rod Tucker.

132
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,492
How the hell come we stick
these lowlife bastards...

133
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:15,658
...in these big ass fancy hotels anyway?

134
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:18,075
Shit, man. This is better than I got.

135
00:07:18,283 --> 00:07:20,075
Hey, you ain't gonna talk them
out of here.

136
00:07:20,283 --> 00:07:22,658
-You gotta blow them out.
-Just stay cool, okay?

137
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:24,742
When we go in there, don't pop off,
all right?

138
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:25,908
I'll be okay.

139
00:07:26,117 --> 00:07:28,992
Come on, let's get on with it.
This is a waste of my time.

140

00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:28,033
<b>No! No!</b>

173
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:29,658
Miguel.

174
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:34,242
Miguel. Miguelito.

175
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,200
Watch out for the girl.

176
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,742
For chrissakes, stand clear.

177
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:55,200
Oh, no, please. No, no, please.

178
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:11,700
MAN: You ain't just in here
by yourself, boy.

179
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:20,283
You was in Wooley's unit, wasn't you?

180
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,575
I didn't see nothing.

181
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:26,742
I didn't see how he died.

182
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,467
Man, there's a lot of people
who were running out.

183
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:25,675
I could run.

184
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:32,925
I could run right tonight.

185
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:43,925
Friend of mine's got this helicopter.

186
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:47,217
He asked me to come with him.

187
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:49,342
Think it's right to run?

188
00:13:59,842 --> 00:14:03,050
Setters, please let me pass.

189
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:06,550
Let's get him to the medics.

190
00:14:06,717 --> 00:14:09,050
No, no, please.

191
00:14:09,675 --> 00:14:11,175
Just let me pass.

192
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:14,258
I go up to seventh floor to find my sister.

193
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:16,383
Just let me pass.

194
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,925
The people of 107 will do
what you wish now.

195
00:14:25,383 --> 00:14:29,800
Many have died last week
on these streets.

196
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:33,258
In the basement of this building,
you'll find them.

197
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,633
I have given them the last rites.

198
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,967
Now, you do what you will.

199
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:43,258
You are stronger than us.

200
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:47,633
But soon, I think they be stronger
than you.

201
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:58,550
When the dead walk, senores,
we must stop the killing...

202
00:14:58,717 --> 00:15:01,092
...or we lose the war,

203
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,256
Hurry, get up! Get it off!

204
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,033
Jesus Christ.

205
00:17:16,742 --> 00:17:18,533
Hey, you okay down there?

206
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:19,867
Yeah.

207
00:17:20,617 --> 00:17:22,700
This must be
where they dumped them in, huh?

208
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,492
-You need more men?
-No, it's all done, man.

209
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,700
It's all been done.

210
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:31,450
Jesus Christ.

211
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,867
Why did these people keep them here?

212
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:47,242
Because they still believe
there's respect in dying.

213
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,250
Come on I need you

214
00:18:07,824 --> 00:18:10,200
I don't see Roger...
we'll give him 10 minutes

215
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:11,070
Steve

216
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,350
just wait right here

217
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,150
just like that...
line in a car

218
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,850
just hold it there..

219
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,883
<i>...captain.</i>

220
00:19:14,883 --> 00:19:16,758
<i>Moving on the top fl--</i>

221
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:19,383
<i>The line's not coming in at all.</i>

222
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,675
Hello, HQ, this is police dock.

223
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:26,925
Operator dead. Post abandoned.

224
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,134
Stephen.

225
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,259
I hope that's Roger.

226
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,250
- What are you doing
- I'll be right there

227
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,550
Just stay cool

228
00:19:50,618 --> 00:19:52,750
- Hello
- Come on Skipper

229
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,330
They got friends coming

230
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:01,850
We're with GON

231
00:20:05,923 --> 00:20:06,580
No, wait a minute

232
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,950
We're just here to refuel

233
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:12,412
Those men were already dead

234
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,289
And you were here, you know that

235
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,770
GON traffic watch

236
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,725
no shit

237
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,300
How many will that thing hold

238
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:26,600
Hey man, I ain't going nowhere

239
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,050
That's true

240
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,970
We'd be stuck, stick with the boat

241
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:35,950
We gotta walk further in this bird

242
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:37,000
Hey that's a squad car

243
00:20:38,214 --> 00:20:39,300
It's OK, we're pleased

244
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,220
Bullshit man

245
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,400
You and your friends are running in the GON traffic

246
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:56,770
What's the problem officer

247
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,900
You got your friends here stealing company gasoline

248
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,600
What do you mean by friends

249
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,750
You guys okay?

250
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:25,958
Who's he?

251
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,458
His name is Peter. He's all right.

252
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,833
Come on, let's hustle.

253
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,458
Hey, you guys,
you better get a move on.

254
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,500
There's a report at the dock's
being knocked out.

255
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:37,208
Right. The left squad.

256
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,833
Can we carry the extra weight?

257
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,375
A little harder on the fuel,
but we'll be okay.

258
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,625
Hey, you got any cigarettes?

259
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:48,458
Any of you guys got cigarettes?

260
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,708
No, sorry.

261
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,083
Where you headed?

262
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,458
Downriver.

263
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,792
We got an idea.
Maybe we can make it to the islands.

264
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,083
What islands?

265
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,917
Any island.

266
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,000
What about you? Where you headed?

267
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,458
Straight up.

268
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,583
Have you got any cigarettes?

269
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,708
I never had a cigarette.
Did any of you guys got cigarettes?

270
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:42,142
an ex-husband

271
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:42,950
an ex-wife

272
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:45,140
- You Peter?
- Some brothers

273
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,900
Those real brothers?

274
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:05,330
you know real brothers or street brothers

275
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,010
both

276
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,200
How many real ones?

277
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,050
- Two

278
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,400
- Two?

279
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,151
One is in jail

280
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,440
The other is a pro ball player

281
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,800
But we catch up each other once in a while

282
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,967
Is he your man?

283
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:39,550
Most of the time, yeah.

284
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:44,758
Just like to know who everybody is.

285
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:46,217
Yeah, me too.

286
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,967
Got any more water?

287
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,883
You know where we are?

288
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:10,300
Yeah, I know exactly where we are.

289
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:11,758
Harrisburg?

290
00:24:11,925 --> 00:24:13,050
Passed it about an hour ago.

291
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,967
Jesus. It's everywhere.

292
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:27,883
We're still pretty close to Johnstown.

293
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,217
Those rednecks are probably enjoying
the whole thing.

294
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:38,342
What are you looking at?

295
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:39,842
Happy hunting.

296
00:24:43,675 --> 00:24:46,508
MAN 1: I heard there about
ten or 12 down in the woods.

297
00:24:48,342 --> 00:24:52,342
MAN 2:
I got at least 14 shells.....

298
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:55,175
MAN 3: I got a couple extra boxes
in case they come around later on.

299
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:30,008
Look out, behind you.

300
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:31,883
Get down, get down. Get out of the way!

301
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:36,383
There, by the old car.

302
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:40,383
Hit the gas tank.

303
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,175
Shit.

304
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:54,592
<b>Ah.</b>

305
00:25:54,758 --> 00:25:56,758
Eh, got him.

306
00:25:57,425 --> 00:25:59,133
Ah, missed.

307
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
Got the bitch.

308
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:33,967
Ah, shit, man, damn near empty.

309
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,883
I got this one.

310
00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:39,592
There's a lot of private planes
in farm country like this.

311
00:26:39,758 --> 00:26:41,633
I guess they all hit the pumps
and they took off,

312
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,008
Yeah, to where?

313
00:26:43,175 --> 00:26:44,425
I got some here.

314
00:26:44,842 --> 00:26:46,883
-Can you handle that?
-Yeah, I got it.

315
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:50,925
I'm gonna see what's left
in the hangars.

316
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:44,633
Bunch of junk.

317
00:28:01,883 --> 00:28:03,592
Stephen?

318
00:28:15,092 --> 00:28:18,133
Run! Run!

319
00:28:19,258 --> 00:28:20,342
Run!

320
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,175
Run!

321
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:24,467
<b>Oh.</b>

322
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,300
Run.

323
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:06,342
Roger!

324
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:53,655
It's all right. It's okay. It's all right.

325
00:30:53,822 --> 00:30:55,488
Peter!

326
00:30:56,113 --> 00:30:58,488
[MURMURING]
Son of a bitch.

327
00:31:15,738 --> 00:31:18,780
PETER:
You never aim a gun at anyone, mister.

328
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,322
FRANCINE:
Peter!

329
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:24,447
Scary, isn't it?

330
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:30,613
isn't it?

331
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,459
We gotta find fuel.
Maybe closer to Cleveland.

332
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,500
No, we gotta stay out of the big cities.

333
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,667
if it's like Philly,
we may never get out alive.

334
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,792
PETER: We may never get out
of any place alive.

335
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:57,375
We almost didn't get out of here.

336
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,167
ROGER:
We're getting out of here fine.

337
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,834
As long as there's not many
of those around, we can handle them.

338
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,042
Yeah, well, it wasn't those things
that nearly blew me away.

339
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:07,125
We gotta stay in the sticks.

340
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,917
I mean, there's bound to be more
private airports upstate.

341
00:32:11,084 --> 00:32:14,459
There's the locks along the Allegheny.
Fuel stations there, state, private.

342
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:17,334
Those are probably still manned.
We don't need those hassles either.

343
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,000
-They're just out after scavengers, looters.
-You got papers for this limousine?

344
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:22,834
I got GON ID. So does Fran.

345
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,500
Right, and we're out
doing traffic reports.

346
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:26,959
Wake up, sucker.

347
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:30,250
We're thieves and we're bad guys.
That's exactly what we are.

348
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:33,000
We gotta find our own way.

349
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:34,625
We don't even know
where we're going.

350
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:38,417
We don't have food, we don't have water.
We don't even have a radio.

351
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:42,167
Stephen, you need to get some sleep.

352
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,625
STEPHEN:
What the hell is it?

353
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:59,625
ROGER: Looks like a shopping center,
one of those big indoor malls.

354
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:39,875
FRANCINE:
Oh, my God.

355
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:41,375
No chance. Let's get out of here.

356
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:44,334
-Wait a minute. They can't get up here.
STEPHEN: We can't go down there.

357
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,584
ROGER:
Let's check it out.

358
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,584
Most of the gates are down.
I don't think they can get into the stores.

359
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,042
I haven't seen any of them
up on the second floor.

360
00:34:16,209 --> 00:34:18,584
The big department stores
usually use both floors.

361
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,084
If we can get in up top....

362
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,375
Okay.

363
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,042
Guess the power's not off in this area.
Could be nuclear.

364
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:42,584
What are they doing?
Why do they come here?

365
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,875
Some kind of instinct.

366
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:47,792
STEPHEN:
Memory of what they used to do.

367
00:34:47,959 --> 00:34:49,959
This was an important place
in their lives.

368
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:54,250
Hey, look at this.

369
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,584
This doesn't go down into the mall.

370
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,417
What the hell is this?

371
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,542
How do we get down there?

372
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:50,667
STEPHEN:
Come down. Come on, drop.

373
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,667
There, let's go.

374
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:57,834
Looks like a free lunch.

375
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:01,375
"SPAM."

376
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:03,500
Did you bring a can opener?

377
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:05,000
No, I guess I didn't.

378
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:07,125
Then don't knock it. It's got its own key.

379
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:13,167
What do you think?

380
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,084
This is the only way up here.
What do you think?

381
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:39,542
[MOUTHING]
No, thanks.

382
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:52,334
You better get some sleep too, buddy.

383
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:57,959
There's an awful lot of stuff down there
that we could use.

384
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:03,834
-I know it.
-It's a big place.

385
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:07,375
But they're pretty spread out
down there.

386
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:09,625
I think we can outrun them.

387
00:37:09,834 --> 00:37:12,584
-Hit and run?
-Hit and run.

388
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,000
You're crazy.

389
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:18,000
This place could be a gold mine.
We gotta at least check it out.

390
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:20,917
This is exactly what we're trying
to get away from. Look what....

391
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:24,750
-Stephen.
-Leave him be. We're going ourselves.

392
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,834
That's ready to shoot. Be careful.

393
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,417
The trigger squeezes real easy.

394
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:32,292
But the weapon will kick you good
when it fires. Be ready for that.

395
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,459
Anyone but us comes up them stairs,
you guys take off in the machine.

396
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:45,875
You'll probably hear some shooting.
Just don't panic, okay?

397
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:14,084
Here.

398
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:50,625
Keys to the kingdom.

399
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:52,959
Grab the walkie-talkies.

400
00:39:39,426 --> 00:39:41,050
It's Christmas down there buddy

401
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,250
brother, how we're gonna work it?

402
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,850
We're getting in one of the apartment stores up here
they probably have their own escalaters inside

403
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:50,677
Let's check those keys

404
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,275
Fifteen upper and lower,

405
00:39:54,317 --> 00:39:55,317
Right here.

406
00:39:55,484 --> 00:39:57,109
How about a little music?

407
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:59,775
-What?
-Might cover the noise we make.

408
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,609
Hit them all. Might as well
have power in everything.

409
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:09,317
We might need it.

410
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,317
[MURMURING]
Jesus Christ.

411
00:40:37,484 --> 00:40:39,859
Stephen? Stephen.

412
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:35,275
What do you think,
bag it or try for it?

413
00:41:35,442 --> 00:41:37,234
-You game?
-I need lighter fluid.

414
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,900
You got it.

415
00:41:50,525 --> 00:41:54,275
Jesus Christ. They're maniacs.

416
00:41:55,275 --> 00:41:56,317
Wait.

417
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,609
All right.

418
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,692
Come on.

419
00:42:19,317 --> 00:42:20,775
Stephen, don't go down there.

420
00:42:20,942 --> 00:42:22,109
Why? What's the matter?

421
00:42:22,275 --> 00:42:24,109
Won't open.

422
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:25,942
Not working.

423
00:42:28,025 --> 00:42:29,942
-To the right.
-Let's go.

424
00:42:45,442 --> 00:42:46,567
ROGER:
Come on.

425
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,650
Come on, don't give in.

426
00:42:55,525 --> 00:42:57,484
Don't open the door, Come on, let up.

427
00:43:05,442 --> 00:43:07,359
Let it go, Take care of the other one.

428
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,250
FRANCINE:
Stephen, for God's sake.

429
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:21,417
Let's get up to the roof.

430
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:23,958
We can't leave those guys down there.

431
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:27,042
ROGER: Well, we're in. Now how the hell
are we gonna get back?!

432
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,292
PETER: Who the hell cares?
Let's go shopping first!

433
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:31,833
PETER: Whoo!
ROGER: Ah!

434
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,083
ROGER:
Watches. Watches.

435
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,250
PETER: Hey, hey, hey,
let's get the stuff we need.

436
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:36,792
I'll get a television and a radio.

437
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:40,042
ROGER: Oh, lighter fluid,
and chocolates, chocolates.

438
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,208
PETER:
Okay.

439
00:43:42,917 --> 00:43:44,625
ROGER: Whoo!
Oh, I'm gonna need a coat.

440
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:47,542
PETER: Why not? It's about time.
ROGER: Whoo!

441
00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:12,625
Hey, man, we can't carry all that shit.

442
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,125
Oh, I see, we're gonna just wheel
right by them.

443
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:17,375
We gonna try, brother.

444
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:20,625
We ain't doing this for the exercise.
We might as well try to get what we can.

445
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:23,208
No way this is gonna happen.

446
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:44,375
Hey, Peter!

447
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:48,750
Whoa! Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

448
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:57,042
All right, let's go, brother.
The old okeydoke.

449
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:58,875
-Okay.
-All right.

450
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:01,833
Hey, hey, ugly.

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,667

-Come on.

00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:28,958
Just give it time. Give it time.

462
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,875
Okay, they're coming.

463
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:55,708
Go on up. Stay out of sight.

464
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:57,250
Let me know when it's clear enough.

465
00:45:57,417 --> 00:45:59,375
-Okay.
-Okay.

-Peter, it's good. Let's do it.
-Is it clear?

469
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:18,875
Not altogether,
but they're spread out good.

470
00:46:19,292 --> 00:46:20,750
I think we can move the wagon.

-Maybe flyboy. Where's it coming from?
-Don't know. I can't tell.

-Open up, I can get the wagon over.

Don't open that door, baby.
You'll lead them right up with you.

484

-We gotta wait before we move.

of them staying up on the balcony.

We can handle that. Break through them.

If any of them see us or hear us,
they'll just follow us on up.

what we got and get the hell out of here.

...maybe we got
a good thing going here.

00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:57,125
Maybe we shouldn't be
in such a hurry to leave.

Oh, man.

If we can get back up there,
without them catching on...

Check out the radio.
See what's happening.

515
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:10,958
There's some kind of passageway
over the tops of these stores.

516
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:14,958
I don't know if it's just heating ducts
or some kind of access.

517
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:17,958
I saw it on a map.

00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:21,917
Upstairs. Let's go.

519
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:33,125

01:07:46,342 --> 01:07:48,092
All right, full speed. Let's go, come on.

689
01:08:26,786 --> 01:08:28,369
Come on, hotshot. Come on.

690
01:08:29,066 --> 01:08:30,608
Come on. Come on, man.

691
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,108
Hey. Hey.

692
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:36,650
Hey.

693
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:20,757
Three more, baby. Three more!

694
01:10:00,299 --> 01:10:01,465
Roger,

695
01:10:08,132 --> 01:10:10,590
Come on. Look, man.

696
01:10:16,132 --> 01:10:17,299
Look.

697
01:10:39,632 --> 01:10:40,840
<i>What?</i>

698
01:11:19,492 --> 01:11:20,825
PETER:
Get its head up.

699
01:11:21,992 --> 01:11:24,117
Get its head up.

700
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,867
Roger, get its head up, man.

701
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,425
Get down!
Get down and stay down. I've got it.

702
01:11:56,591 --> 01:11:58,758
Roger, move!

703
01:12:08,841 --> 01:12:10,883
You bastards.

704
01:12:12,675 --> 01:12:14,383
You bastards.

705
01:12:15,966 --> 01:12:17,466
Roger,

706
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,700
We got this, man.
We got this by the ass.

707
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:33,880
Roger,

708
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,250
Come on, man, get your head together.
We got a lot of work to do.

709
01:12:38,416 --> 01:12:41,750
Let's go, baby. Number two.

710
01:12:43,366 --> 01:12:44,866
You all right?

711
01:12:45,033 --> 01:12:46,950
Perfect, baby. Perfect.

712
01:14:01,533 --> 01:14:03,325
Come on, bring it up.

713
01:14:17,575 --> 01:14:19,658
<b>For chrissake, come on, man.</b>

714
01:14:20,283 --> 01:14:21,700
PETER:
Roger, look out.

715
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:24,450
Roger, come on. Come on, man.

716
01:14:33,908 --> 01:14:36,200
PETER:
Come on, Roger. Come on.

717
01:14:39,283 --> 01:14:41,575
Goddamn motherfucking
sons of bitches.

718
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,208
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

719
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:58,666
What?

720
01:14:58,791 --> 01:15:01,958
My bag,
I left my goddamn bag in the other truck.

721
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:09,208
All right, trooper.
You better screw your head on.

722
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:11,041
Yeah, come on, come on. Let's go.

723
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:12,666
I mean it, man.

724
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:16,208
Now you're not just playing with your life,
you're playing with mine.

725
01:15:17,541 --> 01:15:19,708
Now are you straight?

726
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:26,125
Yeah.

727
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:50,583
Go, Rog. Go, go, go.

728
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,333
Come on, Rog. Come on.

729
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:56,333
Shit.

730
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:05,250
Watch it, man.

731
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:08,750
Watch out. Come on.

732
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:10,333
Back up, man.

733
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:14,916
Roger! Roger, watch it!

734
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,583
Damn.

735
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,416
[GUNSHOT]
FRANCINE: Roger!

736
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,458
[GUNSHOT]
Oh, God.

737
01:16:40,666 --> 01:16:41,791
They got him.

738
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,833
That's it, man.

739
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:04,583
-That's it.
-Oh, bullshit.

740
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,000
We gotta deal with that leg.

741
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:08,667
Mao, I'm dealing with it, man.
Don't you worry about it.

742
01:17:11,833 --> 01:17:15,042
There's a lot to get done
before you can afford to lose me.

743
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:28,708
PETER: It all depends on how many
of them are still inside.

744
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:30,708
That's one hell of a run
we've gotta make.

745
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:32,792
STEPHEN:
If we had more flares.

746
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:34,708
Maybe some of those propane jobs.

747
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:37,833
Guns are first. Guns and ammunition.

748
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:41,542
I'm sorry.

749
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,042
You sure you gonna make it?

750
01:17:56,875 --> 01:17:58,250
Just hurry up with that.

751
01:18:23,042 --> 01:18:24,167
Whew.

752
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:26,417
How about this, huh?

753
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:52,542
Don't try to shoot through those gates.

754
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:53,792
Openings are too small.

755
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:56,292
Bullet will wind up
chasing us around in here.

756
01:18:57,292 --> 01:18:58,708
Don't worry. They can't get through.

757
01:19:13,417 --> 01:19:15,583
-Ain't it a crime?
-What?

758
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:17,750
The only person
who could ever miss with this gun...

759
01:19:17,917 --> 01:19:19,958
...will be the sucker
with the bread to buy it.

760
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:28,000
PETER:
You just wait out there, sissies.

761
01:19:28,167 --> 01:19:29,875
We're coming...

762
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,000
...and we're ready.

763
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:07,625
[WHISPERS]
Okay, let's go.

764
01:20:37,292 --> 01:20:38,333
When the door opens, push.

765
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,500
[GUNSHOT]
STEPHEN: That's it, push. That's it.

766
01:20:56,292 --> 01:20:58,042
Come on, let's go.

767
01:21:07,125 --> 01:21:08,708
Hardware.

768
01:21:10,042 --> 01:21:11,292
Look here, man, I, urn....

769
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:13,542
I know. Shut up, will you?

770
01:21:26,708 --> 01:21:29,792
All right. The toughest part
will be getting by these right here.

771
01:21:29,958 --> 01:21:31,458
Too far.

772
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:35,208
There's no backing out now.
We've gotta lock those main doors.

773
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:37,417
We'll never make all four entrances.
It's too risky.

774
01:21:37,583 --> 01:21:39,042
STEPHEN:
We'll make it.

775
01:21:39,208 --> 01:21:41,625
You just be ready to open up for us.

776
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:45,417
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, the car.

777
01:21:45,583 --> 01:21:46,625
-What?
-One of the cars.

778
01:21:46,792 --> 01:21:49,583
Why don't you use
one of the cars over there?

779
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:56,167
You okay to start it?

780
01:21:56,292 --> 01:21:57,292
Okay, let's go.

781
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:06,208
Come on.

782
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:10,958
Close the door. Close the door.

783
01:22:14,792 --> 01:22:16,500
The keys, Stephen, the keys!

784
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:19,208
Oh, Jesus Christ.

785
01:22:28,167 --> 01:22:29,792
Come on, man. Get out of there.

786
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:33,125
Goddamn it.

787
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:34,667
Keep them, Stephen. Just keep them.

788
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:36,000
Come on, just hang a minute.

789
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:39,458
Oh, man.

790
01:23:45,417 --> 01:23:46,833
Just jump in the back.

791
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,083
-You all right?
-I got it.

792
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:26,833
You get the latches, I'll get the lock.

793
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,583
Got you.

794
01:24:41,583 --> 01:24:43,500
PETER:
That's not a hundred percent.

795
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:45,250
But I don't think they'll get through.

796
01:24:45,417 --> 01:24:46,875
Can't they smash the glass?

797
01:24:47,042 --> 01:24:49,208
Safety stuff. Pretty indestructible.

798
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:51,625
They got no leverage under the truck.

799
01:24:51,792 --> 01:24:54,583
I'm hoping they'll just go away
after they find they can't get in.

800
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:57,917
I'll get the alarm. Get in the car.

801
01:25:07,458 --> 01:25:08,958
<b>Go.</b>

802
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:14,583
We're okay.

803
01:25:15,042 --> 01:25:17,917
<i>We got it made.
It's gonna work.</i>

804
01:25:46,833 --> 01:25:48,542
How many you figure are already here?

805
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:50,167
PETER:
Don't know. Not too many.

806
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:51,958
We'll get them easy.

807
01:25:53,208 --> 01:25:54,708
We'll get it all locked up.

808
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:57,333
Then we're going on a hunt.

809
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:41,917
We put up a wall here:

810
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:44,250
This way,
we can still get to the plumbing.

811
01:27:44,417 --> 01:27:45,958
Why don't we just board up
the stairway?

812
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:49,167
Sooner or later,
there might be a patrol through here.

813
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:50,333
Looters, maybe.

814
01:27:51,167 --> 01:27:54,750
I don't want anybody to even know
that stairway exists.

815
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:25,708
I don't know what else to do.

816
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:27,875
You're doing fine.

817
01:28:28,375 --> 01:28:32,083
His leg is awful.
The infection is spreading quickly.

818
01:28:32,417 --> 01:28:35,833
Can't we do something?
Can't we take him to a med unit?

819
01:28:36,167 --> 01:28:40,083
I've seen half a dozen guys
get bitten by those things.

820
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:44,083
None of them lasted
more than three days.

821
01:28:47,417 --> 01:28:48,667
ROGER:
Peter, where are you?

822
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:51,125
Right here, trooper,

823
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:55,250
We did it, didn't we?

824
01:28:56,375 --> 01:28:57,667
We whipped them, didn't we?

825
01:28:58,375 --> 01:28:59,958
That's right, Rog.

826
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:01,667
Didn't we?

827
01:29:03,042 --> 01:29:04,083
Didn't we whip them?

828
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:06,250
We sure did, buddy.

829
01:29:07,167 --> 01:29:11,167
We whipped them.
Whipped them good.

830
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:15,000
We whipped them and we got it all!

831
01:29:41,992 --> 01:29:43,617
Hey, Fran

832
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:58,700
-Frannie.
-Leave me alone.

833
01:29:58,867 --> 01:30:01,533
It's all right. It's my problem.

834
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:04,950
Just get out of here.
I don't want you here.

835
01:30:08,867 --> 01:30:11,242
I just don't want you to see me
like this, okay?

836
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:15,158
Stephen, get out, please.

837
01:30:29,408 --> 01:30:31,075
PETER:
This place is gonna be rotten.

838
01:30:34,033 --> 01:30:36,325
We gotta clean it up, brother.

839
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:51,575
You never know.

840
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:55,950
<i>Money, money, money</i>

841
01:31:56,617 --> 01:31:58,492
PETER:
Look right.

842
01:33:22,738 --> 01:33:24,321
What do you think?

843
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,578
They're still here.

844
01:35:00,745 --> 01:35:03,953
They're after us.
They know were still in here.

845
01:35:04,578 --> 01:35:06,745
They're after the place.

846
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:09,911
They don't know why,
they just remember.

847
01:35:10,578 --> 01:35:12,953
Remember that they wanna be in here.

848
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:14,786
What the hell are they?

849
01:35:14,953 --> 01:35:16,745
They're us, that's all.

850
01:35:17,411 --> 01:35:21,120
-There's no more room in hell.
-What?

851
01:35:21,870 --> 01:35:24,161
Something my granddaddy
used to tell us.

852
01:35:25,036 --> 01:35:26,411
<i>You know macumba?</i>

853
01:35:27,703 --> 01:35:29,245
Voodoo.

854
01:35:29,578 --> 01:35:32,161
Granddad was a priest in Trinidad.

855
01:35:32,328 --> 01:35:34,578
He used to tell us:

856
01:35:34,745 --> 01:35:40,078
"When there's no more room in hell,
the dead will walk the earth."

857
01:35:52,786 --> 01:35:55,286
Never mind, get up. Hurry up, come on.

858
01:35:57,411 --> 01:35:58,661
Jesus, hurry up!

859
01:36:35,453 --> 01:36:36,828
<b>Go on.</b>

860
01:36:36,995 --> 01:36:38,828
I'll stay with him.

861
01:37:01,328 --> 01:37:04,161
You'll take care of me,
won't you, Peter?

862
01:37:04,745 --> 01:37:06,078
I mean...

863
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:08,328
...you'd take care of me when I go.

864
01:37:08,786 --> 01:37:11,786
Just try to get some sleep, man.

02:03:46,258 --> 02:03:48,591
Peter! Peter!

1033
02:03:54,425 --> 02:03:55,883
Peter!

1034
02:04:02,883 --> 02:04:05,716
Rope, man.

1035
02:04:28,091 --> 02:04:31,133
-I know he's in here.
-Come on!

1036
02:04:34,925 --> 02:04:37,758
-Hey, come on down.
-Come on.

1037
02:04:48,716 --> 02:04:50,216
Give me a bike.

1038
02:05:09,466 --> 02:05:10,925
Son of a bitch.

1039
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:43,492
-Peter, Peter.
-Where the hell are you?

1040
02:06:43,659 --> 02:06:45,075
In the elevator.

1041
02:06:45,242 --> 02:06:46,992
<i>And those things,
they're all over the place.</i>

1042
02:06:47,159 --> 02:06:50,242
Climb up top.
I'll get you out of the grid in the shaft.

1043
02:06:54,367 --> 02:06:55,909
I'm coming

1044
02:08:08,075 --> 02:08:09,617
Flyboy.

1045
02:08:44,325 --> 02:08:45,867
Damn it, flyboy.

1046
02:09:39,034 --> 02:09:40,242
He's dead?

1047
02:09:40,617 --> 02:09:43,575
I heard his gun. Maybe he's all right.

1048
02:09:50,409 --> 02:09:52,159
We'll just wait.

1049
02:09:54,325 --> 02:09:55,992
We'll just wait a while and see.

1050
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:27,309
It's almost light. Let's go.

1051
02:10:29,934 --> 02:10:33,142
He hasn't answered the radio for hours.

1052
02:10:36,975 --> 02:10:38,184
For God's sake.

1053
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:49,184
-What is it?
-Stephen.

1054
02:12:50,517 --> 02:12:52,267
They're coming up.

1055
02:13:06,434 --> 02:13:08,100
Go on. Get out of here.

1056
02:13:13,392 --> 02:13:16,767
-Peter.
-I said get out of here.

1057
02:13:18,559 --> 02:13:22,684
-Jesus Christ, Peter.
-I don't wanna go.

1058
02:13:25,350 --> 02:13:27,475
I really don't.

1059
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:03,017
Get up.

1060
02:14:03,642 --> 02:14:05,309
Move, woman!

1061
02:17:09,309 --> 02:17:12,684
-How much fuel do we have?
-Not much.

1062
02:17:15,475 --> 02:17:16,517
All right.
