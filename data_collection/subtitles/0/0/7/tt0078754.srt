God, l hope he doesn't pick her.
She's uglier than a witch's tit.

47
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,723
The expression is " colder than a witch's tit."

48
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:34,959
- You've never seen a woman's tit in your life.
- Shh. Be quiet, you two.

OK, thank you all very much.
lt was a terrific audition. Just stay in line.

50

Now that's what l call a real drinker's nose.

00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:50,171
And you should know, because
you're a real drinker, aren't you, Joe?

52
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:53,113
- Yeah.
- Also heavy into speed, aren't you?

53
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:56,645
- Yeah.
- Also sleep with a great many women.

54
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:05,526
- Real turnoff, huh?
- Just the opposite.

55
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:09,533

00:08:13,338 --> 00:08:17,502
- The one in the shocking-pink leotard?
- See if any are willing to be swing dancers.

58
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:19,975
- She's tone-deaf.
- With those legs, who cares?

59
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:23,707
Oh, Joey, l know you're in a hurry,
but l want to check your schedule.

62
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:39,490
- You left me without a soprano again!
- Paul, please, will you let me handle it?

63
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:42,158
- What about Diane?
- What <i>abo</i>ut Diane?

64
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:44,895
l've had her in three shows. She's wonderful.

65
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:49,633
At least she can sing. You left me
without a soprano. l gotta have a soprano!

66
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:51,504
Gentlemen, Mr Gideon...

67
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:56,206
The tall dancer with the blue eye shadow -
believe me, he'll hit the high notes.

68
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,111
The five Murray is talking to,
those are the girls l want. OK with you?

69
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:05,714
The tall girl, Victoria - l like her, Daddy.

Hm, she's all right.

Because l cheated. Oh, man,
l cheated every chance l could get.

00:09:19,404 --> 00:09:21,269
OK with you, Audrey?

74

- Liar, womanizer. You woulda liked him.

138
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:41,625
Wait a minute. l don't know.
We may be working very late tonight.

139
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:45,692
- That's OK.
- Yeah. We'll talk later.

140
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:50,672
" At t<i>hose pr</i>i<i>ces, man,</i>
<i>who can afford</i> t<i>o l</i>i<i>ve?"</i>

141
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:54,940
<i>So... accep</i>t<i>ance.</i>

142
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:58,305
<i>- "l accep</i>t<i>!"</i>
- Hold it.

143
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,748
- Hold it.
- Finished, or you wanna run it again?

144
00:14:00,852 --> 00:14:04,948
No, l do not want to run it again,
thank you very much. We are finished.

145
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:09,049
- Anybody have any ideas?
- Oh, l like it, Joe. l think it's really funny.

146
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:11,425
Who asked you, Stacy?

147
00:14:11,496 --> 00:14:15,432
lt's too long... l don't know.
Maybe we can get away with it.

148
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:19,127
Do you suppose
Stanley Kubrick gets depressed?

149
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:24,701
<i>- Do yo</i>u <i>wanna work</i> t<i>on</i>i<i>gh</i>t<i>, Joe?</i>
<i>- No, l gotta work on</i> t<i>he show.</i>

150
00:14:44,462 --> 00:14:48,922
You have really got something... special.

151
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,860
All right...

152
00:14:52,703 --> 00:14:54,762
All right!

153
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:59,706
l want so to be a movie star.

154
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:01,745
Oh?

155
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:04,373
Ever since l was a little kid,

156
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:10,614
l wanted to see my face
on the screen... 40 feet wide.

157
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:12,814
Oh, yeah?

158
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:28,134
l have always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

159
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:33,005
You're looking at my nose,
aren't you? lt's crooked.

160
00:15:39,016 --> 00:15:41,507
lt goes to the left. See?

161
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:45,181
l mean, like, l could always
have that fixed. Like that.

162
00:15:46,557 --> 00:15:48,616
Do you think l could be?

163
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:56,798
You know. A movie star.
ln the movies.

164
00:15:57,335 --> 00:15:59,599
Well, that's ...

165
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:05,139
l don't know anybody
that could answer that question.

166
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:09,646
lt's ... it's a very freaky business, you know?

167
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:16,416
Yeah, l know all about that,
but, like, l wanna know what <i>yo</i>u think.

168
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:19,581
Do <i>yo</i>u think l could be a movie star?

169
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,028
No.

170
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:27,189
Even with a nose job?

171
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:33,628
Well, that's fair.

172
00:16:39,076 --> 00:16:44,013
Like you said, it is a freaky business, though.
You know, you could be wrong, right?

173
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:46,514
Right.

174
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:50,882
l don't dance so hot either, do l?

175
00:16:50,988 --> 00:16:54,424
You will. l promise you.

176
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:57,993
You wanna go to bed?

177
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:02,059
Yeah.

178
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:04,588
l'm sorry. Oh, am l sorry.

179
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:07,357
- Katie!
- l should've called first.

180
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:12,334
Oh, shit.

181
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:18,704
- Did l, like, screw anything up?
- No. <i>l</i> screwed it up.

182
00:18:20,578 --> 00:18:23,479
Oh, l meant to call her.

183
00:18:28,986 --> 00:18:32,080
Oh, boy, you are really something.

184
00:18:47,738 --> 00:18:50,036
l'm Joey's mother.

185
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:54,134
Ever since he was so high,
he's had such a crush on you!

186
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:57,640
l've always been fond of Joe, too.

187
00:18:57,748 --> 00:19:00,182
Of all the children, he was the least worry.

188
00:19:00,718 --> 00:19:04,210
He worked in all those
cheap burlesque clubs.

189
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:07,980
Always around stark-naked girls!

190
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,027
But did it bother him? No.

191
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:14,988
He never paid any attention.
Never even looked at them.

192
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:18,168
<i>Ama</i>ti<i>s,</i> you love. <i>Aman</i>t, they love.

193
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:23,200
<i>Amo, amas, ama</i>t<i>, amam</i>u<i>s, ama</i>ti<i>s, aman</i>t.

194
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:26,141
Hey, kid, what kind of language is that?

195
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:33,810
Oh, it's not a language. lt's just some
jokes l'm working on. Some crazy jokes.

196
00:19:40,391 --> 00:19:42,951
<i>"P</i>u<i>... P</i>u<i>..."</i>

197
00:19:46,397 --> 00:19:49,025
<i>P</i>u<i>ella.</i> Girl.

198
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,232
" First Year Latin" ?

199
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:57,399
lt's my kid brother's .

200
00:19:58,109 --> 00:20:01,272
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

201
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:04,836
Uh-huh. What year were you born?

202
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:07,075
Uh, 1930...

203
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:10,711
- Try 1934.
- Right. 1934.

204
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:12,880
1935?

205
00:20:14,492 --> 00:20:16,824
1935, yeah.

206
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:19,124
Now try 1492.

207
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:22,626
See you around, kid.

208
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:28,136
Maybe we could have
a drink together sometime?

209
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:30,139
Oh, sure.

210
00:20:34,478 --> 00:20:39,677
You notice we have small waitresses here.
You know why? Make the drinks look bigger.

211
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,617
That's my favorite one.
The one with the big tips.

212
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:45,712
l got problems, too.
l went to see my psychiatrist.

213
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:50,692
l told him l have suicidal tendencies.
He says " From now on, you pay in advance."

214
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:55,630
Look, l don't have to do this for a living.
l have four chinchillas at home in heat.

215
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:59,035
No, l make a lot of money.
l just have trouble passing it.

216
00:20:59,336 --> 00:21:01,668
l just have trouble passing it. ls this on?

217
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:05,768
First-year Latin!

218
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:10,870
lt's three o'clock in the morning.
lsn't it past your bedtime?

219
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:16,078
l don't look for big laughs. l'll settle
for intelligent nods. Anything. Wink.

220
00:21:16,654 --> 00:21:20,385
You better stop lying, or your nose will grow!

221
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:24,359
Ooh! <i>Some</i>t<i>h</i>i<i>ng's</i> growing!

222
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:28,693
The drummer's not really with the band,
but he has the car. Married 14 years.

223
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:32,293
14 years, no children! Strict mother-in-law.

224
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:36,772
Let's continue on. Right now, ladies
and gentlemen, here he is, Tops'n 'T aps,

225
00:21:36,874 --> 00:21:40,605
- may we present Mr Joe Gideon!
- You're on!

226
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:23,715
Joey's never done anything to disappoint me.

227
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:47,804
lt's showtime, folks.

228
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,742
- You believe in love?
- l believe in saying " l love you."

229
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,583
Helps you concentrate.

230
00:22:58,656 --> 00:23:01,682
<i>Joe,</i> t<i>hey</i>'v<i>e asked me</i>
t<i>o go on</i> t<i>o</i>u<i>r w</i>it<i>h</i> t<i>he show.</i>

231
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:03,817
How long?

232
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:08,058
Six months. What do you think?

233
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:12,294
- And you say it all the time.
- l say it a lot. A lot.

234
00:23:12,403 --> 00:23:14,598
- When?
- When it works.

235
00:23:14,672 --> 00:23:18,574
You know, l love you, Katie, but l think
you have to do what's best for you.

236
00:23:18,642 --> 00:23:22,578
- Just what do you mean, Joe?
- Sometimes it doesn't work.

237
00:23:25,783 --> 00:23:29,617
l mean, for your sake, l think you should go.

238
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:45,391
Hello, Michael? lt's Katie.

239
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:50,598
So, um, did you mean it about dinner?

240
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:54,007
Wally's at 11?

241
00:23:54,078 --> 00:23:57,241
You're surprised? <i>l'm</i> a little surprised.

242
00:23:58,716 --> 00:24:02,812
Thank you. OK, Michael. Bye-bye.

243
00:24:05,322 --> 00:24:11,022
l'm a little surprised too. lsn't that nice?
Now we're all a little surprised.

244
00:24:12,963 --> 00:24:15,056
- Who was that?
- Michael Graham.

245
00:24:15,132 --> 00:24:18,260
- Who is Michael Graham?
- The dancer in my ballet class.

246
00:24:18,335 --> 00:24:20,667
Straight or gay?

247
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:23,101
What do you mean?

248
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,041
l mean is he looking to get laid,
or is he looking for Mr Right?

249
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:30,677
He's straight.

250
00:24:31,882 --> 00:24:33,941
And tall.

251
00:24:39,456 --> 00:24:42,118
Michael Graham is a very tall name.

252
00:24:47,664 --> 00:24:50,326
Oh, goddammit!

253
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:55,300
How dare you use my phone, my telephone,
to call somebody who's not gay?

254
00:24:55,706 --> 00:24:59,540
l see. You can go out
with any girl, any girl in town...

255
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,170
That's right. l go out with any girl in town.

256
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,509
l stay in with you.

257
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,712
Joe, it's not fair...
l'm spilling the coffee...

258
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:14,417
lt's all wrong. Everything is all wrong.

259
00:25:17,294 --> 00:25:19,819
That's some set of rules you had for her.

260
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,898
Yeah, l know. l know.

261
00:25:21,965 --> 00:25:25,560
But as long as you could
get away with it, right?

262
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:27,301
Right.

263
00:25:27,371 --> 00:25:33,708
l don't wanna go out with Michael Graham.
l don't want a date. l have no small talk left.

264
00:25:33,777 --> 00:25:38,578
l don't wanna fool around, l don't wanna
play games and l don't wanna fight.

265
00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:42,312
l just want to love you.

266
00:25:56,533 --> 00:25:58,592
Katie...

267
00:26:00,737 --> 00:26:03,672
l try to give you everything l can give.

268
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:07,777
Oh, you give, all right. Presents, clothes...

269
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:10,569
l just wish

270
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:13,445
you weren't so generous with your cock.

271
00:26:19,857 --> 00:26:21,950
That's good.

272
00:26:28,198 --> 00:26:31,099
Maybe l can use that some time.

273
00:26:39,076 --> 00:26:45,037
Katie! About the goddamn tour...
l don't think you should go.

274
00:26:45,115 --> 00:26:47,208
Wrong reading.

275
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:54,218
Softly and with feeling.

276
00:26:56,593 --> 00:26:59,061
Don't go.

277
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:06,794
Please?

278
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:11,871
- Why do you suppose she put up with it?
- l can think of many reasons

279
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:16,072
- for wanting to be with you.
- Now don't bullshit a bullshitter.

280
00:27:19,883 --> 00:27:23,148
? Take off with us, take off with us

281
00:27:23,253 --> 00:27:26,552
? We're warmin' up, so take off with us

282
00:27:26,657 --> 00:27:30,115
? NY to LA-A-A

283
00:27:30,227 --> 00:27:33,287
? Goin' all the way-ay-ay

284
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,489
? Won't you climb aboard?

285
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:39,762
? You'll ride as smooth as glass

286
00:27:40,304 --> 00:27:45,173
- lt's perfect. Didn't l tell you?
- ? Up there, where the clouds are pillowy

287
00:27:45,275 --> 00:27:48,676
? You're as close to heaven as you'll ever be

288
00:27:48,745 --> 00:27:51,873
? Lean back, relax, here come the snacks

289
00:27:51,949 --> 00:27:54,941
? Drop your diet, have a fall

290
00:27:55,052 --> 00:28:00,251
? Don't stop with one, try 'em all

291
00:28:00,991 --> 00:28:04,119
? Music's ready to begin

292
00:28:04,194 --> 00:28:07,595
? Take out your headset, plug it in

293
00:28:07,698 --> 00:28:10,690
? What's your answer, chu-hu-hum?

294
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:13,964
? Are you gonna co-o-ome?

295
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:17,666
? On the coolest, hottest trip

296
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:21,108
? That's ever been

297
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:24,811
Oh, it's very, very good!

298
00:28:24,915 --> 00:28:28,783
l think we might even get
a commercial tie-in with the airlines.

299
00:28:28,885 --> 00:28:31,217
- You think so? Great.
- Audrey?

300
00:28:33,323 --> 00:28:35,382
Well, ask...

301
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,730
Yeah, it's OK.

302
00:28:43,734 --> 00:28:46,168
Let me see what l can do with it.

303
00:28:46,236 --> 00:28:50,172
l think it's just what the show needs.
lt's catchy, it's bouncy. Right, Ted?

304
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,141
- Oh, yeah, very bouncy and catchy.
- Can we hear it again?

305
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,179
- l'd love to hear it again.
- Oh! Arnie...

306
00:28:57,614 --> 00:29:00,378
Turn. Some fuckin' music.

307
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:04,409
- Turn back.
- Arch your back. Extend the right leg.

308
00:29:04,554 --> 00:29:07,990
Ease your paerner down gently.
Slide. Slide.

309
00:29:08,725 --> 00:29:10,852
Slide!

310
00:29:12,729 --> 00:29:15,630
<i>Have yo</i>u <i>ever slep</i>t <i>w</i>it<i>h ano</i>t<i>her woman?</i>

311
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:19,799
l once tried living with two girls.
Two girls at once.

312
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:23,032
- We lived together.
- Laughed together.

313
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,337
- Drank together.
- Smoked together.

314
00:29:27,644 --> 00:29:29,737
Slept together.

315
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:37,251
Woke up one morning...
one of them was gone.

316
00:29:37,354 --> 00:29:39,549
On the bureau, she left a note.

317
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:43,749
l'm sorry. l cannot share you anymore.

318
00:29:43,827 --> 00:29:47,854
l want you all to myself, or not at all.

319
00:29:48,198 --> 00:29:52,362
Please, please try to understand.

320
00:29:52,436 --> 00:29:55,769
l not only understood, l was flattered.

321
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:58,706
l was flattered that she felt
so strongly about me.

322
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:01,642
How did you know the note was to you?

323
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:12,452
<i>No. No,</i> t<i>ha</i>t<i>'s no</i>t <i>me, man. No.</i>

324
00:30:12,589 --> 00:30:14,716
<i>Somebody else, maybe, b</i>ut <i>no</i>t <i>me.</i>

325
00:30:14,825 --> 00:30:18,056
- What is this, Eddie?
- Not me. Talk to him.

326
00:30:18,128 --> 00:30:22,064
Joey, l gotta talk to you
about these time sheets.

327
00:30:22,132 --> 00:30:27,331
Three weeks now we've been on triple time.
The brass is eating my ass out!

328
00:30:27,437 --> 00:30:29,905
You shot 82 days on a 65-day schedule.

329
00:30:30,006 --> 00:30:33,237
On a four-month editing schedule,
you've gone seven months.

330
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,108
We're already 2.2 million
over the original budget.

331
00:30:36,213 --> 00:30:41,810
Joey, God made the entire world in six days.
He didn't go on oveerime once.

332
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:47,346
You can't even cut an hour-and-a-half movie
in seven months, on triple time?

333
00:30:47,457 --> 00:30:50,290
Joey, l hate to do this.
l'm usually a very calm man,

334
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,921
but this whole thing
has got me terribly crazy.

335
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,625
l must put my foot down.
Joey, the whole thing has gotta stop.

336
00:30:57,701 --> 00:31:00,431
lt has to stop. lt's got to stop!

337
00:31:00,504 --> 00:31:02,904
ltjust simply must stop!

338
00:31:02,973 --> 00:31:08,104
Josh, l made changes in the monologue.
l think you'll like it. l have to go to rehearsal.

339
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:11,873
<i>A</i>t t<i>hose pr</i>i<i>ces, who can afford</i> t<i>o l</i>i<i>ve?</i>

340
00:31:11,948 --> 00:31:17,477
- Nice talking to you, Josh.
<i>- So l accep</i>t<i>!</i>

341
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:20,351
Oh, my God. lt i<i>s</i> better.

342
00:31:21,057 --> 00:31:24,185
- God help us all.
<i>- Wa</i>it <i>a m</i>i<i>n</i>ut<i>e. Real dead body.</i>

343
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:28,025
lt's better.

344
00:31:28,298 --> 00:31:32,860
OK, that looks pretty good. l like it.
Let's go. Everybody down, in a straight line.

345
00:31:32,936 --> 00:31:35,700
Move down, move down.
Move down, Victoria.

346
00:31:35,772 --> 00:31:38,673
- And sing it out. Here we go.
- Five, six, seven...

347
00:31:38,742 --> 00:31:44,612
? And any seat you grab will be first class

348
00:31:44,714 --> 00:31:48,673
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
And l don't like it.

349
00:31:58,428 --> 00:32:00,362
Uh, double that.

350
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,763
- Which button?
- The white one, down.

351
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:15,744
Ah, that stinks. Let's play something else.
Do me a favor. Take off your shoes.

352
00:32:15,812 --> 00:32:18,940
- What's that?
- lt's a mint.

353
00:32:19,015 --> 00:32:22,951
- Can l have one?
- No, come on, you wouldn't like it.

354
00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:25,112
Let me try this.

355
00:32:25,188 --> 00:32:29,352
Here, you stand over there,
then jump up on my shoulder.

356
00:32:29,426 --> 00:32:31,986
Oh, God, you're getting heavy.

357
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:35,327
All right, put your leg in an arabesque.
There we are.

358
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:39,232
- How are things at home?
- They're pretty good.

359
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:42,066
All right, watch your back now.

360
00:32:42,172 --> 00:32:45,801
- Anything you wanna tell me?
- l promised Mom l wouldn't bring it up.

361
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:48,071
But you're gonna bring it up anyway.

362
00:32:48,178 --> 00:32:50,612
Sit down. You can tell me
anything. You know that.

363
00:32:50,747 --> 00:32:54,012
Gimme your wrists. Ready? And jump.

364
00:32:54,284 --> 00:32:57,549
- lt's just that l keep wondering, Dad...
- Bend your knees.

365
00:32:57,621 --> 00:32:59,748
What is it you keep wondering?

366
00:32:59,823 --> 00:33:02,223
Why don't you get married again?

367
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:05,283
Do a head roll.

368
00:33:07,264 --> 00:33:12,031
l don't get married again because
l can't find anyone l dislike enough

369
00:33:12,102 --> 00:33:14,502
to inflict that kind of toerure on.

370
00:33:15,505 --> 00:33:18,303
Hey, why don't you marry Katie?
She's terrific.

371
00:33:18,408 --> 00:33:20,876
Keep rolling your head.

372
00:33:20,977 --> 00:33:24,174
Straighten your leg. Yeah, you're right.

373
00:33:24,247 --> 00:33:28,707
She's terrific. That's exactly
why l don't wanna marry her.

374
00:33:30,053 --> 00:33:33,614
Run off to the corner.
Jump and l'll catch you.

375
00:33:33,723 --> 00:33:36,055
And Victoria? You're not too crazy about her.

376
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:39,584
Just run and jump.
Never mind that. Come on.

377
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:43,923
- What about the blonde?
- What blonde?

378
00:33:44,034 --> 00:33:48,994
The one in Philadelphia with the TV show?
You know, the one Mom keeps talking about.

379
00:33:49,072 --> 00:33:51,131
Oh, yeah, that blonde.

380
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:55,207
Jump up and wrap your legs around me.

381
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:57,803
Wrap around, that's it.

382
00:33:59,115 --> 00:34:02,607
Why is it so impoerant to you that...
Follow my hand.

383
00:34:02,686 --> 00:34:05,849
Why is it so impoerant to you
that l get married again?

384
00:34:05,922 --> 00:34:08,356
Cos then you'd stop screwing around.

385
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:11,325
Hey! Watch your language.

386
00:34:12,362 --> 00:34:15,695
- Oh, shit! Look at the time.
- Oh, Daddy, can't we stay longer?

387
00:34:15,832 --> 00:34:18,699
- No, your mother will kill me.
- Oh, it's so much fun.

388
00:34:18,835 --> 00:34:23,272
No, no, absolutely. Come on.
Stop flocking your legs. Come on.

389
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:27,139
- Oh, please?
- No, no, no, no.

390
00:34:27,677 --> 00:34:32,444
Besides, if you got married again, maybe
you'd have a baby and l'd have a brother.

391
00:34:32,515 --> 00:34:34,779
l'll call Heerz and rent you a brother.

392
00:34:34,884 --> 00:34:38,342
- Oh, very funny.
- Oh, everybody's a critic.

393
00:35:52,395 --> 00:35:54,022
Showtime, folks.

394
00:35:55,532 --> 00:35:57,523
Showtime.

395
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:00,031
Five, six, seven, eight.

396
00:36:00,637 --> 00:36:03,629
Stop smiling. Lay back. Lay back.

397
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:08,335
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Candy, Casey, very good.

398
00:36:08,411 --> 00:36:12,245
You're gonna do it again, Victoria.
Gary, Danny, let's go.

399
00:36:12,348 --> 00:36:15,374
Stop smiling. lt's not
the high-school play. Count.

400
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:17,750
Five, six, seven, eight.

401
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:20,016
Hold it.

402
00:36:23,827 --> 00:36:25,954
Stand on your right foot.

403
00:36:26,563 --> 00:36:28,497
Point your left toe.

404
00:36:28,598 --> 00:36:32,967
Drop that shoulder.
Now, that's not too hard, is it?

405
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,797
Again.

406
00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:41,301
Five, six, seven, eight.

407
00:36:43,279 --> 00:36:46,043
Lay back, Victoria. Lay back.

408
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:47,515
Lay back!

409
00:36:49,085 --> 00:36:51,485
Hold it, hold it.

410
00:37:01,331 --> 00:37:05,267
- Sorry.
- No, you're right. l'm terrible.

411
00:37:05,335 --> 00:37:09,999
l know l'm terrible. l look
in the mirror and l'm embarrassed.

412
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:15,306
Maybe l should quit. l... l just
can't seem to do anything right.

413
00:37:16,846 --> 00:37:21,010
Listen, l can't make you a great dancer.

414
00:37:22,485 --> 00:37:25,352
l don't even know
if l can make you a good dancer.

415
00:37:25,455 --> 00:37:29,323
But if you keep tryin' and don't quit,

416
00:37:31,094 --> 00:37:34,029
l know l can make you a <i>better</i> dancer.

417
00:37:35,498 --> 00:37:38,865
And l'd like very much to do that.

418
00:37:41,738 --> 00:37:43,831
Stay?

419
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:47,866
Are you gonna keep yelling at me?

420
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:52,376
Probably.

421
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:57,317
Five, six, seven, eight. One and two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two.

422
00:38:00,723 --> 00:38:04,250
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight. One, two.

423
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:14,127
Better.

424
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:22,578
Breathe deep. Again.

425
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:24,670
Hold it.

426
00:38:24,747 --> 00:38:27,409
All right, you can turn around now.

427
00:38:30,086 --> 00:38:32,145
Breathe deep.

428
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:35,548
Again.

429
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,361
All right, you can put your shier on now.

430
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:43,160
Well, Doctor? Does he pass?

431
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,634
Good. Now l'm woerh a million dollars.

432
00:38:46,736 --> 00:38:49,933
That's only if you die before February 1st.

433
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:52,564
Schedules, Goldie, always schedules.

434
00:38:53,409 --> 00:38:55,843
Can we take you to lunch, Doctor?

435
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:04,751
? And any seat you grab
will be first class

436
00:39:04,821 --> 00:39:08,154
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

437
00:39:08,424 --> 00:39:11,188
Nah, that's no good either. Let's try this.

438
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:16,830
- Measure 412.
- l do the same as before?

439
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:19,197
Yeah, same thing, only l'll be behind you.

440
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:24,935
? And any seat you grab will be first class

441
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:28,239
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

442
00:39:28,945 --> 00:39:33,678
All right, let's everybody try it.
Grab a paerner. Come on.

443
00:39:33,783 --> 00:39:35,944
OK, here we go. Ready?

444
00:39:36,452 --> 00:39:38,010
Five, six, seven, eight.

445
00:39:38,154 --> 00:39:44,354
? And any seat you grab will be first class

446
00:39:44,427 --> 00:39:46,486
Five, six, seven...

447
00:39:49,465 --> 00:39:52,229
- Do it again.
- Once more, everybody.

448
00:39:54,804 --> 00:39:57,796
Ready? Five, six, seven...

449
00:39:57,874 --> 00:40:02,368
? And any seat you grab will be first class

450
00:40:02,445 --> 00:40:05,972
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

451
00:40:25,635 --> 00:40:27,694
OK.

452
00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:33,635
- OK, here we go. Once more, everybody.
- l gotta get outta here. l'll be back later.

453
00:40:36,245 --> 00:40:39,214
- How does this look, Paul?
- l love it, love it.

454
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,143
No. lt's too cute.

455
00:40:48,758 --> 00:40:50,453
Ah! Oh, shit.

456
00:40:56,332 --> 00:41:00,029
l can't go back to that room.
l can't face those dancers.

457
00:41:01,437 --> 00:41:05,464
l'm stuck. They keep staring at me,
and nothing's coming out.

458
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:09,102
- Oh, boy, the number's lousy.
- My song, lousy?

459
00:41:09,245 --> 00:41:13,045
No, not the song. Me, me,
the way l'm staging it.

460
00:41:15,051 --> 00:41:19,511
- Maybe we should cut it.
- Cut it? l think l'll leave.

461
00:41:19,789 --> 00:41:24,055
Paul, sit right there. Go back to bar 17.

462
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:29,456
And...

463
00:41:34,137 --> 00:41:37,197
Did you hear what l said?
Nothing is coming.

464
00:41:37,874 --> 00:41:43,938
Don't worry, Paul, he always says the same
thing about every number, in every show.

465
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,547
Now how the hell do you know
what l always say?

466
00:41:47,617 --> 00:41:51,713
- lt would be better if l stepped outside.
- Keep playing, Paul.

467
00:41:53,022 --> 00:41:57,982
l'm only doing this goddamn show because
you wanna play that stupid 24-year-old girl.

468
00:41:58,094 --> 00:42:01,495
Oh, l knew sooner or later you'd say that.

469
00:42:01,564 --> 00:42:04,032
You <i>do</i> think l'm too old for the paer.

470
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:07,395
Well, you're wrong.

471
00:42:07,503 --> 00:42:11,940
l can play 24 years old,
and l'll damn well prove it.

472
00:42:12,008 --> 00:42:14,738
You wanna quit the show? Quit the show.

473
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:17,439
You don't have to do anything for me.

474
00:42:17,547 --> 00:42:25,511
Just don't kid yourself that you're doing this
show for any reason except guilt about me.

475
00:42:25,922 --> 00:42:29,255
Guilt? What guilt?

476
00:42:29,826 --> 00:42:33,023
For never going one day
when you were faithful to me?

477
00:42:33,129 --> 00:42:35,154
Oh, that guilt.

478
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:40,531
Faithful, faithful... You're always
talking about being faithful.

479
00:42:40,603 --> 00:42:43,265
Audrey, why do you think so small?

480
00:42:46,742 --> 00:42:50,872
Besides, how do l know
you were faithful to me?

481
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:54,677
- You know l was.
- That's right, l know you were.

482
00:42:55,084 --> 00:42:58,485
- Oh, you meant to do that.
- Yes, l did.

483
00:42:58,588 --> 00:43:03,423
You kept me working all the time.
l never had a <i>chance</i> to cheat.

484
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:05,961
What is this big hang-up about fidelity?

485
00:43:06,028 --> 00:43:09,896
What makes being faithful
the greatest friggin' vierue in the world?

486
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:11,464
Excuse me.

487
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:14,764
Well, it is a great deal better

488
00:43:14,837 --> 00:43:18,068
than the meaningless affairs
you keep tap-dancing through.

489
00:43:18,174 --> 00:43:21,371
Those Stacys, those Victorias...

490
00:43:21,444 --> 00:43:24,413
You're not even fooling Michelle
with Victoria, you know.

491
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,577
- Straighten that leg.
- lt is as straight as it's ever going to get.

492
00:43:29,652 --> 00:43:33,088
Oh, the Bonnies, the Wendys,
the Debbies, the Donnas...

493
00:43:33,189 --> 00:43:37,182
l can't even remember
all their names. Give me a hand.

494
00:43:37,627 --> 00:43:39,595
Keep playing, Paul.

495
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:45,995
Bet you can't either. Quick, tell me, what
was the name of the girl in Philadelphia?

496
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:48,735
The blonde with the television show?

497
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,500
Oh, the blonde with the television
show in Philadelphia?

498
00:43:55,611 --> 00:43:59,342
l remember that girl's name.
Because that girl meant something to me.

499
00:43:59,448 --> 00:44:03,646
The blonde with the television show,
her name was Sweetheaer.

500
00:44:07,023 --> 00:44:09,617
- Honey?
- No.

501
00:44:10,459 --> 00:44:12,518
Baby?

502
00:44:13,696 --> 00:44:16,529
l can't remember her name.

503
00:44:16,632 --> 00:44:18,930
Dorothy.

504
00:44:19,035 --> 00:44:21,731
- Dorothy.
- Who cares?

505
00:44:21,837 --> 00:44:24,271
l can't remember her name.

506
00:44:29,111 --> 00:44:31,705
The number's lookin' good.

507
00:44:31,781 --> 00:44:33,874
Keep working.

508
00:44:38,988 --> 00:44:43,550
- ls he gonna cut the number?
- No, l don't think so, Paul.

509
00:44:43,659 --> 00:44:46,287
He's gonna cut it. He's gonna cut it.

510
00:44:48,364 --> 00:44:53,927
Oh, God, that man.
He's gonna drive me crazy.

511
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:10,485
lt's showtime, folks.

512
00:45:15,992 --> 00:45:19,291
lt's ... it's not quite ready yet.

513
00:45:19,395 --> 00:45:23,422
And, Paul, it's not exactly
the way we talked about it.

514
00:45:23,532 --> 00:45:25,966
- Hm?
- lt's a little different.

515
00:45:26,035 --> 00:45:28,833
- Mind doing that somewhere else?
- Sorry.

516
00:45:28,938 --> 00:45:32,430
lf you wanna come in, l'll show it
to you in about five minutes.

517
00:45:32,742 --> 00:45:35,176

549
00:48:27,016 --> 00:48:31,953
Thanks, thanks a lot, but it's
not exactly over yet. Murray?

550
00:48:32,087 --> 00:48:34,487
Smoke, smoke.

551
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:37,787
Smoke... Smoke...

552
00:48:39,094 --> 00:48:42,325
The lights go down
and a light comes up over there.

553
00:48:43,132 --> 00:48:48,365
Welcome. Welcome aboard Air Rotica.

554
00:48:48,437 --> 00:48:52,237
? Take off with us

555
00:48:52,942 --> 00:48:55,410

? Take off with us

558
00:49:04,553 --> 00:49:07,215
Let us all get to know one another.

559
00:49:07,423 --> 00:49:12,918
- Remember, we can take you anywhere.
- They're taking their clothes off.

560
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:14,257
Mm-hm.

561
00:49:14,363 --> 00:49:19,164
Just reach out your hand
and introduce yourselves.

562
00:49:19,635 --> 00:49:22,661
- My name is Sandahl.
- My name is Autumn.

563
00:49:24,273 --> 00:49:26,833
- My name is Jennifer.
- My name is Rima.

564
00:49:27,243 --> 00:49:29,177
- Gary.
- John.

565
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,498
Uh-oh. l think we just lost
the family audience.

566
00:51:14,516 --> 00:51:16,484
- My name is Candace.
- My name is Jennifer.

567
00:51:16,552 --> 00:51:18,349
- My name is Rima.
- My name is Danny.

568
00:51:18,454 --> 00:51:20,354

00:51:20,456 --> 00:51:22,390
- My name is John.
- My name is Gary.

570
00:51:26,195 --> 00:51:30,689
And don't forget about
our group fun, fun, fun plan.

571
00:52:40,402 --> 00:52:43,132
Now Sinatra will never record it.

572
00:53:33,789 --> 00:53:38,385
Then an actor comes out
from the side of the stage and says...

573
00:53:39,228 --> 00:53:42,095
- " Not once, during any of our flights..."
- Goodbye.

574
00:53:42,197 --> 00:53:44,791
- See you around.
- Hope to see you again real soon.

575
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:48,597
" ..of any real human communication."

576
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,501
- Well, uh...
- Goodbye.

577
00:53:50,606 --> 00:53:55,043
" Our motto is: we take you
everywhere, but get you nowhere."

578
00:54:02,951 --> 00:54:07,854
Boy, l hate to huer his feelings,
but we can't have that on a stage.

579
00:54:09,258 --> 00:54:11,317
Take five.

580
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:19,758
Well?

581
00:54:20,836 --> 00:54:24,567
Yeah, it's , um... it's , uh...

582
00:54:26,842 --> 00:54:28,639
interesting.

583
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,871
Yes, very interesting.

584
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:33,311
Did you like it?

585
00:54:33,382 --> 00:54:36,351
- lt's unusual.
- Mm-hm, very unusual.

586
00:54:48,497 --> 00:54:52,194
Oh, l don't think they liked it.

587
00:54:54,369 --> 00:54:56,462
What do you think?

588
00:54:57,072 --> 00:55:02,772
l don't know about the audiences, but
l think it's the best work you've ever done.

589
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:10,609
You son of a bitch.

590
00:55:13,388 --> 00:55:18,883
Jesus Christ! Sex, sex, sex - can't he
ever think of anything else but sex?

591
00:55:19,595 --> 00:55:22,530
That's his sickness.

592
00:55:25,801 --> 00:55:29,293
Nah, nothin' l ever do is good enough.

593
00:55:29,371 --> 00:55:34,399
lt's not beautiful enough, it's not
funny enough, it's not deep enough...

594
00:55:34,509 --> 00:55:36,841
lt's not anything enough.

595
00:55:37,346 --> 00:55:41,908
Now, when l see a rose, that's perfect.

596
00:55:42,017 --> 00:55:47,785
l mean, that's perfect. l wanna look up to God
and say " How the hell did you do that?"

597
00:55:47,856 --> 00:55:52,987
- " And why the hell can't l do that?"
- That's probably one of your better con lines.

598
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:56,394
Yeah, it is. But that
doesn't mean l don't mean it.

599
00:55:57,432 --> 00:55:59,593
<i>If l were God...</i>

- lt's a bomb.
- Really?

619
00:57:10,205 --> 00:57:15,336
Yeah, really. You'll have to make a speech.
Tell 'em it's a rough cut, we're not finished...

620
00:57:15,444 --> 00:57:18,470
- Tell 'em any excuse you can think of.

621
00:57:18,547 --> 00:57:22,313
- l'm not gonna be there.
- You're not coming? Where you gonna be?

622
00:57:22,417 --> 00:57:26,877
Hiding someplace, probably
vomiting, or drinking, or both.

623
00:57:26,955 --> 00:57:29,355
We'll staer recutting Monday morning.

624
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:32,283
They bought that love story?

625
00:57:32,361 --> 00:57:35,956
Oh, l'm sorry.
l wasn't answering the phone.

626
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:38,155
l t<i>h</i>i<i>nk</i> they told me they liked it.

627
00:57:38,266 --> 00:57:43,294
Just wasn't answering the phone...
Come on, don't bullshit a bullshitter.

628
00:57:43,638 --> 00:57:46,129
No, l don't believe you either.

629
00:57:46,241 --> 00:57:49,677
l'll have her home by 10:30, don't worry. Bye.

630
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,273
Oh, shit.

631
00:57:57,319 --> 00:58:01,949
Hello. Stacy? Oh, listen,
l'm sorry. l'm in a meeting.

632
00:58:02,057 --> 00:58:04,548
Just don't panic on the staircase.

633
00:58:04,993 --> 00:58:09,157
At least three people said
how much they liked the screening.

634
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:14,358
One was my producer, one was
my lawyer and one was Michelle's mother.

635
00:58:14,469 --> 00:58:18,872
Oh, Joe, everybody loved it. We tried to
tell you that last night. You wouldn't listen.

636
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,706
You know, that was the first R-rated
movie l ever saw, and l loved it.

637
00:58:22,778 --> 00:58:26,270
- Did you understand it?
- Well, l understood everything

638
00:58:26,348 --> 00:58:30,614
except the paer where the two girls
were in bed together and they were kissing.

639
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:32,744
What was that supposed to mean?

640
00:58:32,821 --> 00:58:34,914
- ls dinner ready yet?
- No.

641
00:58:35,023 --> 00:58:39,960
- What was that supposed to mean?
- Well, Michelle, uh,

642
00:58:40,028 --> 00:58:42,519
there are ceerain women who...

643
00:58:42,597 --> 00:58:44,963
- Who...?
- Thanks a lot.

644
00:58:47,102 --> 00:58:51,698
There are ceerain women
who just don't relate to men, so they...

645
00:58:51,773 --> 00:58:55,937
l think lesbian scenes are a big turnoff.

646
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,572
l shoulda cut it.

647
00:59:01,783 --> 00:59:05,219
- What's goin' on here?
- Never mind. You'll find out.

648
00:59:06,354 --> 00:59:09,255
- Couldn't l be doin' somethin'
- Just turn off the lights when we tell you.

649
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,659
- Turn on the phonograph when we tell you.
- Yes, ma'am.

650
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,658
Oh, no, don't ...

651
00:59:22,471 --> 00:59:24,996
- Where'd you get those hats?
- Not tellin' ya.

652
00:59:25,073 --> 00:59:28,008
That's for us to know and for you to find out.

653
00:59:28,643 --> 00:59:34,240
- Oh, the lights, lights, lights.
- Joe, could you turn off the lights, please?

654
00:59:34,983 --> 00:59:37,543
Now turn on those whachamacallit lights.

655
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,279
Yes, ma'am.

656
00:59:47,762 --> 00:59:48,990
Crash!

657
00:59:49,064 --> 00:59:54,798
Ladies and gentlemen, in honor
of El Stinko, El Blotto's screening

658
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:57,703
of Joe Gideon's new film, <i>The S</i>t<i>and</i>u<i>p,</i>

659
00:59:57,806 --> 01:00:02,766

dancing sensations Jagger and Gideon!

660
01:00:02,844 --> 01:00:06,780

- Gideon and Jagger.

661
01:00:06,848 --> 01:00:10,511
Give us our music, Joe.
ln an underrehearsed tribute.

662
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:13,918
- Sit down, Joe, sit down.
- Sit down, Daddy.

663
01:00:17,392 --> 01:00:19,451
And... go!

664
01:00:21,496 --> 01:00:24,397

665
01:00:28,403 --> 01:00:30,837

01:02:46,775 --> 01:02:48,640
- Can we do it again?
- l don't wanna.

700
01:03:12,767 --> 01:03:14,997
lt's showtime, folks.

701
01:03:16,504 --> 01:03:19,905
And these two columns
revolve New York to LA.

702
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:23,102
And over here on the other side,
the same thing.

703
01:03:23,211 --> 01:03:27,671
There's two staircases down here and
two more that come back into the orchestra.

704
01:03:27,782 --> 01:03:32,446
Oh, yeah, and this centerpiece
moves out for the interior scenes,

705
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,045
and up there, that's Stan.

706
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:39,259
You'll get familiar with it when we staer.

707
01:03:39,327 --> 01:03:45,129
OK, now, all l wanna do now
is to read easily through the script,

708
01:03:45,233 --> 01:03:49,135
and, frankly, l'm not too
familiar with it myself.

709
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:57,405
So if we go through it, then you'll give Paul
and me some rough idea of what we've got.

710
01:03:57,512 --> 01:04:02,848
OK, no acting.
Everyone just take it easy. Easy.

711
01:04:03,818 --> 01:04:05,718
All right, lights up.

712
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:10,223
Audrey, you have your first number,
and then you begin reading on page two.

713
01:04:11,292 --> 01:04:14,819
You see, Sammy, in California,
everybody needs a car.

714
01:04:14,896 --> 01:04:19,424
l got a friend who bought a Mercedes
just to get to the bathroom.

715
01:05:53,528 --> 01:06:00,661
l guess only in America can a 24-year-old girl
like me own a house like this in Beverly Hills.

716
01:06:04,839 --> 01:06:08,002
Thank you all very much.
You've done a wonderful job.

717
01:06:08,076 --> 01:06:13,480
Take an hour and a half for lunch.
Don't forget to sign the Boston hotel list.

718
01:06:38,373 --> 01:06:40,432
Excuse me.

719
01:06:49,117 --> 01:06:52,416
There's no use to panic till
we find out what it really is.

720
01:06:52,487 --> 01:06:53,852
Do stop that.

721
01:06:56,057 --> 01:07:00,084
<i>Dr Ball</i>i<i>nger</i> i<i>s look</i>i<i>ng a</i>t <i>h</i>i<i>m now.</i>
<i>Ball</i>i<i>nger</i> i<i>s</i> t<i>he bes</i>t t<i>here</i> i<i>s, A</i>u<i>drey.</i>

722
01:07:00,194 --> 01:07:05,222
- Dr Hyman, we just left him. He seemed fine.
- Just fine.

723
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:09,293
Well, he called. He said he had
chest pains, his left arm was numb...

724
01:07:09,904 --> 01:07:14,864
<i>l'm a l</i>i<i>ttle bew</i>i<i>ldered myseIf.</i>
<i>l checked h</i>i<i>m abo</i>ut <i>a mon</i>t<i>h ago.</i>

725
01:07:14,943 --> 01:07:19,710
All right, who's in charge of this all-impoerant
show that Mr Gideon keeps talking about?

726
01:07:19,814 --> 01:07:21,543
l guess l am.

727
01:07:21,683 --> 01:07:25,551
Mr Gideon is having attacks of angina
that could lead to a massive coronary.

728
01:07:25,687 --> 01:07:29,145
Oh, shit! l gotta get to rehearsals.
l'm fine. What do doctors know?

729
01:07:29,257 --> 01:07:31,953
About angina, a little more
than show people.

730
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:35,655
lf you wanna leave, fine,
but l think you'll die. Can l see you?

731
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:37,823
Dr Hyman.

732
01:07:40,468 --> 01:07:44,131
The pain is gone. Nothing wrong
with me a rewrite wouldn't cure.

733
01:07:44,238 --> 01:07:48,072
- Couple of good jokes is what l need.
- You can't leave now.

734
01:07:48,142 --> 01:07:50,770
- Yes, l can.
- Damn it, Joe!

735
01:07:51,145 --> 01:07:54,171
Didn't you hear what the doctorjust said?

736
01:07:54,282 --> 01:07:54,976
Please, stay.

737
01:08:02,283 --> 01:08:06,686
- Joey, l've been talking to Dr Ballinger...
- Jonesy, wait a minute.

738
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:11,986
Let me talk to the star here. lf l stay,
how much time are we talking about?

739
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:14,619
At least two or three weeks.

740
01:08:14,695 --> 01:08:18,597
You've got to be kidding!
l got a show to put on.

741
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:23,262
Jonesy, for Chrissakes, will you talk to these
people? They don't understand anything.

742
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:26,305
- Oh, Jesus...
- What's wrong?

743
01:08:26,907 --> 01:08:29,239
- Miss Collins. All right, easy.
- Damn it.

744
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:33,906
You guys are doin' this to me.
l wasn't sick until l got here.

745
01:08:34,181 --> 01:08:37,014
- What's wrong with him?
- lt's exhaustion.

746
01:08:40,588 --> 01:08:42,647
You're lying to me.

747
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:45,251
Yes.

748
01:08:48,896 --> 01:08:52,195
<i>Uh, no. No, l'm no</i>t <i>a member</i>
<i>of h</i>i<i>s</i> i<i>mmed</i>i<i>a</i>t<i>e fam</i>i<i>ly.</i>

750
01:08:55,236 --> 01:09:00,435
Well, can l leave a message for him, please?
Could you tell him that K...? Hello?

751
01:09:04,278 --> 01:09:06,838
<i>l</i>t <i>was j</i>u<i>s</i>t <i>s</i>i<i>mply exha</i>u<i>s</i>ti<i>on.</i>

01:09:06,914 --> 01:09:09,474
<i>He j</i>u<i>s</i>t t<i>r</i>i<i>ed</i> t<i>o do</i> t<i>oo m</i>u<i>ch.</i>

753
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:15,716
Anyway, we've made a decision
to postpone the show for four months.

754
01:09:15,956 --> 01:09:19,551
- The doctors assure us Joe will be fine.
- There goes my new apaerment.

755
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:23,357
Therefore the show will
definitely be done. l promise.

756
01:09:25,533 --> 01:09:30,232
Now, we're aware of the financial burdens...

757
01:09:30,304 --> 01:09:34,331
l gave up a TV series. What a dummy.

758
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:41,574
We're prepared to try to get you
temporary jobs, or even lend you money.

759
01:09:41,682 --> 01:09:45,345
Jonesy, Jonesy, easy on
the money, easy on the money.

760
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:48,552
All right, Larry, all right, OK.

761
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:52,587
We don't have a lot of cash available, but...

762
01:09:52,693 --> 01:09:55,594
what l'd like to say to you is,

763
01:09:55,696 --> 01:10:01,259
l... we... think of you all as family.

764
01:10:01,335 --> 01:10:03,769
- Bullshit.
- And we want to do everything

765
01:10:03,904 --> 01:10:07,931
we possibly can to keep you all together.

766
01:10:08,008 --> 01:10:11,466
<i>l was w</i>it<i>h h</i>i<i>m las</i>t <i>n</i>i<i>gh</i>t.
<i>Already he's m</i>u<i>ch better.</i>

769
01:10:18,552 --> 01:10:24,616
And he told me to tell all of you, he has
a terrific idea for a new hospital number.

770
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:28,821
Hold it, Audrey, hold it.
Hospital number, hospital number!

771
01:10:28,963 --> 01:10:32,023
Just give me a minute.
Stanley, give me some room.

772
01:10:32,132 --> 01:10:35,295
- How does the title " Hospital Hop" grab you?
- lt grabs me.

773
01:10:35,369 --> 01:10:37,428
Great, great.

774
01:10:39,707 --> 01:10:42,642
- l think l got it. l got it!
- l think he's got it. He's got it.

775
01:10:42,743 --> 01:10:45,439
Stan, help me out, please.

776
01:10:46,146 --> 01:10:48,171
Clap your hands.

777
01:10:53,587 --> 01:10:54,611
Cheer up.

778
01:10:55,723 --> 01:10:58,317
<i>Le</i>t<i>'s go! Everybody.</i>

779
01:11:09,603 --> 01:11:15,473
And, Lucas, they are without question
an absolutely marvelous cast.

780
01:11:15,576 --> 01:11:20,741
Now we gotta wait around for four months.
Maybe even lose them.

781
01:11:20,814 --> 01:11:27,219
l can see where it'd be difficult to hold
a cast like that together. lt's really a shame.

782
01:11:27,288 --> 01:11:31,554
And, of course, even after
four months, a heaer attack...

783
01:11:32,793 --> 01:11:35,455
There's no guarantee
that he'll be able to work.

784
01:11:35,562 --> 01:11:37,393
None.

785
01:11:37,464 --> 01:11:40,228
Jules, it's still too bright.

786
01:11:41,635 --> 01:11:45,662
- Take number seven down five.
- And he's the greatest.

787
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:52,571
And, Lucas, l think we have a sure hit.

788
01:11:53,247 --> 01:11:55,477
A sure hit.

789
01:11:55,582 --> 01:11:58,016
Reads like a dream.

790
01:11:58,852 --> 01:12:03,448
- l'd love to read it sometime.
- l'll get a copy to you this afternoon.

791
01:12:03,524 --> 01:12:06,516
Oh, l forgot. Wait a minute.

792
01:12:08,195 --> 01:12:11,722
l've got one right here with me.

793
01:12:11,832 --> 01:12:14,426
Dimmer five up to three.

794
01:12:15,102 --> 01:12:17,400
Hold that, hold that. That's good.

795
01:12:18,038 --> 01:12:21,496
Of course, l know you couldn't
care less about the money.

796
01:12:21,608 --> 01:12:24,076
What do you think about this, Lucas?

797
01:12:24,144 --> 01:12:26,237
ls it any better?

798
01:12:27,715 --> 01:12:31,651
No. No, no. lt needs to be more... shadowy.

799
01:12:31,719 --> 01:12:35,416
We talked about this, Jules.
lt's a seduction scene.

800
01:12:36,557 --> 01:12:38,889
All right, take the shadow lights to half.

801
01:12:40,327 --> 01:12:43,888
How much... is Joe getting?

802
01:12:44,765 --> 01:12:48,428
5% of the gross until payoff,
then he goes to 6% .

803
01:12:48,502 --> 01:12:52,768
20% of all subsidiary rights,
including a movie sale.

804
01:12:58,545 --> 01:13:02,914
Well, of course
my schedule's impossible, but...

805
01:13:07,521 --> 01:13:10,581
You know how l feel about you, Jonesy.

806
01:13:11,258 --> 01:13:15,456
- You've been like a father to me.
- And you a son to me.

807
01:13:16,697 --> 01:13:19,860
l always look for the worst in people.

808
01:13:19,933 --> 01:13:24,666
- A piece of you in them?
- Yeah, a piece of me.

809
01:13:24,738 --> 01:13:26,899
And, generally, l find it.

810
01:13:26,974 --> 01:13:30,205
Well, it may take you years, but you'll find it.

811
01:13:30,744 --> 01:13:33,713
Oh, you're cute. You are cute.

812
01:13:41,422 --> 01:13:46,689
lt's looking better. l think we'll move you
upstairs to a private room for a while.

813
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,887
Oh, yeah.

814
01:13:48,962 --> 01:13:52,830
But you'd better rest.
lf you don't , you're in for a lot of trouble.

815
01:13:52,933 --> 01:13:55,959
Oh, l will, doctor.

816
01:13:56,036 --> 01:13:59,164
l promise. l will.

817
01:14:15,155 --> 01:14:16,747
Mr Gideon.

818
01:14:25,165 --> 01:14:27,360
Mr Gideon, what are you doing?

819
01:14:28,035 --> 01:14:30,560
Oh, this? l was just getting rid of it.

820
01:14:30,637 --> 01:14:33,936
l caught someone smoking,
and l told him a man in my condition

821
01:14:34,007 --> 01:14:36,271
shouldn't even be around smoke.

822
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:48,216
l'm telling ya, Gideon,
l got real insight into you.

823
01:14:48,288 --> 01:14:51,416
There's a deep-rooted fear
of being conventional.

824
01:14:51,492 --> 01:14:53,585
Right.

825
01:14:59,032 --> 01:15:03,969
Your blood pressure is higher than we hoped.
Your cardiograms haven't improved one bit.

826
01:15:04,037 --> 01:15:07,768
Now, if you don't give a damn,
it's hard to expect us to.

827
01:15:16,383 --> 01:15:18,442
Mr Gideon!

828
01:15:19,786 --> 01:15:25,247
l'll leave these menus with you. Please check
off what you want for the coming weeks, OK?

829
01:15:25,325 --> 01:15:29,022
Monday, l'll have roast beef,
Tuesday, chicken, Wednesday, steak,

830
01:15:29,096 --> 01:15:32,998
Thursday, l plan to be dead,
so... l'll just have something light.

831
01:15:33,066 --> 01:15:35,034
Mr Gideon!

832
01:15:41,441 --> 01:15:44,933
She wrote a little note on the back.
She said <i>yo</i>u<i>'d</i> understand.

833
01:15:45,045 --> 01:15:50,540
" Dear loving, giving, generous" -
underlined four times - " Dad,

834
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:57,557
l hear nurses are nice people, hint, hint.
Your poor, brotherless daughter."

835
01:15:58,425 --> 01:16:01,087
Joe, what does it mean?

836
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:06,897
lt means she's inherited her mother's
determination, that's what it means.

837
01:16:19,112 --> 01:16:24,744
<i>Oh, no... Thank yo</i>u, t<i>hank yo</i>u<i>. No, no...</i>

845
01:16:54,081 --> 01:16:56,606

847
01:17:02,089 --> 01:17:06,185
- You missed by five years.
- Oh, boy, do l hate show business.

848
01:17:06,326 --> 01:17:10,729
- Joey, you love show business.
- That's right, l love show business.

849
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:12,526
l'll go either way.

850
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:26,435
l got insight into you, Gideon.

851
01:17:26,546 --> 01:17:31,813
You know what's underneath?
The dreadful fear that you're ordinary,

852
01:17:31,918 --> 01:17:33,647
not special.

853
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:36,447
Right.

854
01:17:37,557 --> 01:17:40,117
Oh, l think...

855
01:17:41,161 --> 01:17:43,186
l think...

856
01:17:43,263 --> 01:17:48,166
- l'm getting an erection.
- Oh, Mr Gideon, don't do that.

857
01:17:48,735 --> 01:17:54,037
That sex thing, Jesus. Listen,
l wouldn't say you were a faggot,

858
01:17:54,775 --> 01:17:58,734
but you do have a lot
of feminine characteristics, right?

859
01:18:02,849 --> 01:18:04,612
Right.

860
01:18:11,692 --> 01:18:15,560
You are foolishly and childishly
fliering with disaster.

861
01:18:15,629 --> 01:18:21,261
Joey, you're really crazy!
What do you wanna do, kill yourself?

862
01:18:25,072 --> 01:18:28,041
Dr Ballinger told me to get a little exercise.

863
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:33,111
Everything he does seems
to be a denial of his condition.

864
01:18:33,213 --> 01:18:35,579
Dr Ballinger, every time l've seen him,

865
01:18:35,649 --> 01:18:39,813
l get the impression that
he doesn't care whether he lives or dies.

866
01:18:39,886 --> 01:18:42,787
Yes, l know. But l think he cares a lot.

867
01:18:42,856 --> 01:18:46,087
OK, we'll limit his visitors
to no more than two.

868
01:18:46,193 --> 01:18:48,184
<i>Joe, l w</i>i<i>sh yo</i>u <i>co</i>u<i>ld have been</i> t<i>here.</i>

869
01:18:48,462 --> 01:18:51,226
9:30 this morning,
before a single review was out,

870
01:18:51,298 --> 01:18:57,999
the line at Cinema One was around the
block. The people know. The people <i>know.</i>

871
01:18:58,071 --> 01:19:04,840
This broke every first-day record.
lt's a blockbuster. l mean a <i>blockb</i>u<i>s</i>t<i>er.</i>

872
01:19:05,412 --> 01:19:09,872
And those guys in California...
You wouldn't believe the telephone calls.

873
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:15,684
" Congratulations," they say. " We're <i>glad</i>
you took your time. lt was woerh it."

874
01:19:15,756 --> 01:19:20,693
They said " Every dollar that we put
in that film is up there on the screen."

875
01:19:20,761 --> 01:19:24,720
l'm telling you, they're talking about
a $3.5 million adveerising budget.

876
01:19:24,831 --> 01:19:28,460
3.5 million dollars! l'm sorry. Excuse me.

877
01:19:28,535 --> 01:19:33,837
Do you believe that? 3.5 million dollars. This
picture is gonna go right through the roof.

878
01:19:33,907 --> 01:19:37,502
Right through... the roof.

879
01:19:37,978 --> 01:19:43,143
Look at those reviews. See it?
We did it. Joe, we did it.

880
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:45,445
Where are the bad ones?

881
01:19:45,519 --> 01:19:47,680
There are no bad ones.

882
01:19:47,754 --> 01:19:49,847
Josh...

883
01:19:49,923 --> 01:19:53,723
Well, there were a couple that
quibbled a little. l left them at the office.

884
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:57,787
Josh, l want you to do me a favor -
don't show them to me.

885
01:19:57,898 --> 01:20:00,594
Never. How were the television reviews?

886
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:05,694
l think we got Leslie Perry.
At the screening, she told me she loved it.

895
01:20:38,939 --> 01:20:41,965
- What does she know?
- She never gives a good review.

896
01:20:42,042 --> 01:20:46,206
That woman is totally unqualified
to criticize anything.

897
01:20:46,313 --> 01:20:49,771
- She doesn't know a damn thing about film.
- Or anything.

898
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:54,116
She's not even reviewing a film.
She's telling you how clever <i>she</i> is.

Larry, give me <i>o</i>u<i>r</i> figures.

967
01:26:11,371 --> 01:26:17,970
Well, on an estimated
production budget of $941,000,

968
01:26:18,077 --> 01:26:22,138
with a contingency of 59,000
to round it out to the million,

969
01:26:22,582 --> 01:26:25,881
<i>so far we're</i> i<i>n for</i>
<i>a</i>t <i>leas</i>t <i>two-</i>t<i>h</i>i<i>rds of</i> t<i>he fees.</i>

970
01:26:25,952 --> 01:26:30,889
Design, 8,000, costumes, 8,000,
electrics, 4,000.

971
01:26:30,957 --> 01:26:37,157
We're in for the full director-choreographer,
15,000. Casting is another four.

972
01:26:37,564 --> 01:26:45,266
Construction of scenery, where more than
half has been done, that's 125,000... plus.

973
01:26:45,538 --> 01:26:48,507
<i>S</i>t<i>age manager's abo</i>ut <i>8,000.</i>

974
01:26:48,741 --> 01:26:54,407
Press agent 1500, musicians about... two.

975
01:26:55,081 --> 01:26:58,778
Assistants, secretaries, etc, 3,000.

976
01:26:58,918 --> 01:27:03,378
Rehearsal halls and auditions... 9500.

977
01:27:03,489 --> 01:27:06,117
Script and administrative, 1500.

978
01:27:06,192 --> 01:27:09,593
Managers, l'd say... ten.

979
01:27:10,196 --> 01:27:17,034
Adveerising and printing, about 20,000.
Orchestrations, so far, around 10,000.

980
01:27:19,105 --> 01:27:22,336
Legal, 10,000, auditing, 2,000,

981
01:27:23,042 --> 01:27:26,205
payroll taxes... maybe seven.

982
01:27:27,013 --> 01:27:32,178
Well, seven. Author's advances, 10,000,
equity bonds, 50,000.

983
01:27:32,252 --> 01:27:37,952
Rehearsal salaries, and we've made some
advances to a few of the cast, about 43,000.

984
01:27:38,024 --> 01:27:40,117
We're in for about...

985
01:27:40,994 --> 01:27:43,519
$480,500.

986
01:27:44,197 --> 01:27:47,030
Yes. That's the figure l had here.

987
01:27:47,133 --> 01:27:49,124
And change.

988
01:27:51,037 --> 01:27:53,267
Let me try to understand.

989
01:27:53,373 --> 01:27:56,809
Of that figure, how much do we recoup?

990
01:27:56,943 --> 01:28:00,936
Yeah, l'm confused too. Do we
get all of that, or paer of it, or what?

991
01:28:01,014 --> 01:28:04,677
Simply, here are the options.
One, if Mr Gideon recovers

992
01:28:04,784 --> 01:28:09,812
and you resume production within the
180 days, we are not liable for any paer of it.

993
01:28:09,956 --> 01:28:14,052
Two, if Mr Gideon should die and you resume
production with another director

994
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:18,358
within the 180 days, we are still not liable.

995
01:28:19,198 --> 01:28:23,999
Three, however, if Mr Gideon
should expire before February 1,

996
01:28:24,871 --> 01:28:27,635
<i>and yo</i>u <i>abandon prod</i>u<i>c</i>ti<i>on,</i>

997
01:28:27,707 --> 01:28:30,369
we are liable for the full million dollars.

998
01:28:30,443 --> 01:28:34,777
This means, gentlemen,
you could make a profit of...

999
01:28:36,783 --> 01:28:41,117
$519,500.

1000
01:28:42,588 --> 01:28:48,857
You could be the first show on Broadway
to make a profit without really opening.

1001
01:28:51,898 --> 01:28:54,025
Well...

1002
01:28:55,134 --> 01:28:57,694

1077
01:34:39,845 --> 01:34:45,215
- Where were ya, Joe? Where were ya?
- ? We tried to warn you

1078
01:34:46,018 --> 01:34:48,009
? Somehow

1079
01:34:48,087 --> 01:34:51,614
You didn't listen, Daddy. You didn't listen.

1080
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:58,394
? You had your way

1081
01:34:58,664 --> 01:35:03,601
? Now you must pay

1082
01:35:05,237 --> 01:35:15,875
? We're glad that you're sorry now

1083
01:35:16,649 --> 01:35:18,173
Cut!

1084
01:35:22,321 --> 01:35:24,619
You blew it. You forgot your line.

1085
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:28,786
At the end you're supposed to say, uh...
What's he supposed to say?

1086
01:35:28,861 --> 01:35:33,628
He's supposed to say
"l don't want to die. l want to live."

1087
01:35:36,869 --> 01:35:41,033
Well, if you can't say it, you can't say it.
We'll just have to cut it, that's all.

1088
01:35:41,107 --> 01:35:44,201
Cut it. Take me up. Next setup.

1089
01:36:09,635 --> 01:36:16,097
? Some of these days

1090
01:36:16,175 --> 01:36:20,271
? You're gonna miss me, Daddy

1091
01:36:20,646 --> 01:36:24,844
? Some of these days

1092
01:36:24,917 --> 01:36:28,683
? You're gonna feel so lonely

1093
01:36:29,288 --> 01:36:32,724

1094
01:36:33,292 --> 01:36:37,661
? You'll miss her kissin'

1095
01:36:37,730 --> 01:36:40,893

1096
01:36:41,867 --> 01:36:46,327

1097
01:36:46,605 --> 01:36:50,541
? l'll feel so lonely

1098
01:36:50,609 --> 01:36:54,705
? Just for you only

1099
01:36:54,780 --> 01:36:58,773
? For you know, Daddy

1100
01:36:59,018 --> 01:37:02,715
? You had your way

1101
01:37:02,788 --> 01:37:08,749
- A lot.
- ? And if you leave her

1102
01:37:08,828 --> 01:37:13,561
? You know, you know, you're gonna, gonna,
gonna, gonna, gonna grieve her

1103
01:37:13,632 --> 01:37:19,935
? You're gonna miss your sweet,
little, lovin', baby daughter Michelle

1104
01:37:21,707 --> 01:37:26,235
- ? Some of these days
- Don't die, Daddy! Don't die, please!

1105
01:37:26,345 --> 01:37:27,778
? Some of these days

1106
01:37:27,847 --> 01:37:31,305
You can't leave this poor
little kid without a father!

1107
01:37:31,383 --> 01:37:35,945
- ? Some of these days
- She needs ya, Joe! She needs ya!

1108
01:37:36,021 --> 01:37:42,654
? Some of these days

1109
01:37:47,066 --> 01:37:49,193
Oh! Oh, no.

1110
01:37:49,835 --> 01:37:51,928
You don't have any lines here.

1111
01:37:55,574 --> 01:37:58,270
<i>Real dead body. Real dead body.</i>

1112
01:37:59,612 --> 01:38:01,671
End sticks.

1113
01:38:03,949 --> 01:38:09,785
Please don't try to talk. lf you wanna
tell me anything, just write it on this pad.

1114
01:38:13,692 --> 01:38:16,752
<i>No, no. Come on, no</i>t <i>now.</i>

1115
01:38:18,864 --> 01:38:21,560
Please leave. Please.

1116
01:38:23,502 --> 01:38:26,960
- Are you sure?
- Yes, l'm sure. Just go.

1117
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:28,700
Am l alive?

1118
01:38:29,241 --> 01:38:31,368
All right, Joe.

1119
01:38:33,412 --> 01:38:36,176
Yes, you are alive.

1120
01:38:37,249 --> 01:38:39,979
Now, this is gonna huer a little...

1121
01:38:41,287 --> 01:38:45,223
Hm. That came out nice.

1122
01:38:45,791 --> 01:38:48,988
Miss Paris, would you like
to see something nice?

1123
01:38:49,061 --> 01:38:53,327
Oh, that is beautiful!

1124
01:38:53,432 --> 01:38:58,028
That is an absolutely beautiful scar, Dr Garry.

1125
01:38:58,103 --> 01:39:01,197
- Thank you.
<i>- How soon w</i>i<i>ll he be able</i> t<i>o work?</i>

1126
01:39:01,307 --> 01:39:05,038
Well, he's out of intensive care,
back in a private room.

1127
01:39:05,110 --> 01:39:09,547
The doctor says it's just a matter of rest.
Two months, at the outside.

1128
01:39:09,648 --> 01:39:14,551
Oh, you know Joey. This morning
he said he could hardly wait.

1129
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:17,445
Said he had a lot of new ideas.

1130
01:39:17,556 --> 01:39:19,751
And not all that sex stuff, either.

1131
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,252
Now, that's terrific.

1132
01:39:22,328 --> 01:39:25,764
You must feel really good about that, Jonesy.

1133
01:39:25,864 --> 01:39:29,356
Relieved. We're all relieved.

1134
01:39:30,069 --> 01:39:33,061
- Check, please.
- l did some thinking about your script

1135
01:39:33,138 --> 01:39:35,436
and l made a few notes.

1136
01:39:35,507 --> 01:39:37,475
Oh, my.

1137
01:39:37,576 --> 01:39:41,774
Use them, don't use them...
You know, whatever you want.

1138
01:39:42,481 --> 01:39:47,248
l hate to bother you,
but are you... Lucas Sergeant?

1139
01:39:47,319 --> 01:39:49,378
- Yes.
- Would you mind?

1140
01:39:49,488 --> 01:39:51,786
No, no. Not at all.

1141
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:57,391
l'm an actress and, next to Joe Gideon,
you're my favorite director.

1142
01:39:59,932 --> 01:40:03,095
l'm so sorry your show was a flop.

1143
01:40:05,871 --> 01:40:09,967
- Best of luck with your career.
- Thank you so much.

1144
01:40:10,476 --> 01:40:15,812
Lucas, you put in an awful lot
of work on this. l'm moved.

1145
01:40:16,181 --> 01:40:23,485
For somebody to do something like this
just... just out of friendship... lt touches me.

1146
01:40:23,555 --> 01:40:27,150
Listen, what are friends for?
We're all rooting for each other.

1147
01:40:27,226 --> 01:40:29,922
l'm just pleased that Joe is well again.

1148
01:40:30,162 --> 01:40:34,758
- Hey, let me get this.
- No, Lucas, this is on me.

1149
01:40:34,833 --> 01:40:36,926
l said l'll get this.

1150
01:40:39,905 --> 01:40:43,807
- l can't believe it.
- Joe, what's the matter?

1151
01:40:44,777 --> 01:40:48,543
- l'm having a heaer attack.
- No, that's impossible, Mr Gideon.

1152
01:40:48,647 --> 01:40:50,945
l just gave you your medication.

1153
01:40:51,016 --> 01:40:55,214
Goddamn it, he knows the symptoms.
Will you call somebody, please?

1154
01:40:55,654 --> 01:40:57,952
He can't be in pain.

1155
01:40:58,023 --> 01:41:00,116
Well, let me take his pulse.

1156
01:41:00,192 --> 01:41:03,127
- How can it be?
- Goddammit, get somebody.

1157
01:41:03,195 --> 01:41:08,189
But l just gave you your medication 20
minutes ago. You can't possibly be in pain.

1158

That's funny, Doctor. l gotta tell you,
it huers like a son of a bitch.

1160
01:41:17,009 --> 01:41:19,443
Miss Briggs, two milligrams of morphine.

1161
01:41:20,145 --> 01:41:22,409
- What's this?
- My name and address.

1162
01:41:22,481 --> 01:41:25,177
You can send my check there.

No. But something is...

1166
01:41:33,459 --> 01:41:37,156
- something is breaking up in there.
- Now t<i>ha</i>t l like.

1167
01:41:38,864 --> 01:41:41,492
Somethin's gone wrong.

1168

<i>All wrong.</i>

1169
01:41:45,104 --> 01:41:48,301

He just wants to sit around

Oh, don't hurry, baby.

1235
01:47:02,421 --> 01:47:06,084

Nice and quiet, now. Don't cause no trouble.

1244
01:47:50,735 --> 01:47:55,229
- Everything's going to be fine, all right?
- All right. So long, Tiger.

1245
01:47:55,340 --> 01:47:57,399
Later, Gideon.

1246
01:47:57,476 --> 01:48:00,240
This is just a rough cut, you know?

1247
01:48:00,345 --> 01:48:04,782
l don't have the titles in yet,
and the underscoring's not in.

1248
01:48:05,617 --> 01:48:08,085
lt's not really finished.

1249
01:48:08,186 --> 01:48:10,177

1250
01:49:01,039 --> 01:49:04,600

1255
01:49:20,225 --> 01:49:24,753
And he came to believe that work,
show business, love, his whole life,

1256
01:49:24,863 --> 01:49:27,889
even himself, and all thatjazz, was bullshit.

1257
01:49:28,033 --> 01:49:30,365
He became <i>n</i>u<i>mero</i> u<i>no</i> game player,

1258
01:49:30,468 --> 01:49:36,065
to the point where he didn't know
where the games ended and reality began.

1259
01:49:36,174 --> 01:49:40,508
Like, to this cat, the only reality...
is death, man.

1260
01:49:41,246 --> 01:49:44,943
Ladies and gentlemen, let me lay
on you a so-so enteerainer,

1261
01:49:45,050 --> 01:49:49,316
not much of a humanitarian,
and this cat was never nobody's friend.

1262
01:49:49,387 --> 01:49:53,721
ln his final appearance on the great stage
of life - you can applaud if you wanna -
