1
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:39,762
Come on, come on over.
Have something to drink with us. Come on, drink with us.

2
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:44,167
Drink it! Drink it! Drink it! Drink it!

3
00:30:33,144 --> 00:30:36,144
Do you want gold?

4
00:30:38,817 --> 00:30:41,817
Yes.

5
00:34:43,962 --> 00:34:46,962
You are excrement.
You can change yourself into gold.

6
00:35:27,672 --> 00:35:30,672
You broke the looking glass,
now break the stone.

7
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:57,365
This stone has a soul,

8
00:35:58,036 --> 00:36:01,036
formed by the work of millions of years.

9
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:08,276
The tarot will teach you
how to create a soul.

10
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:02,290
To know.

11
00:38:14,372 --> 00:38:17,372
To dare.

12
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,220
To want.

13
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:39,227
To be silent.

14
00:38:44,669 --> 00:38:47,669
The same force the vulture uses
so siege the ox

15
00:38:48,406 --> 00:38:51,406
is needed by the ox
to receive the vulture.

16
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:37,419
The fish thinks about his hunger,
Not about the fisherman.

17
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,760
It is the master
who seeks the disciple.

18
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:52,602
You want to know the secret,

19
00:39:52,603 --> 00:39:55,603
but man can achieve nothing by himself.

20
00:39:56,107 --> 00:39:59,107
To accomplish the alchemical work.
you will have these companions.

21
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:03,478
They are thieves like you,
But on another level.

22
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:06,948
They are the most powerful people
on the planet.

23
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:10,318
Industrialists and politicians.

24
00:40:11,155 --> 00:40:14,155
My name is Fon.
My planet is Venus.

25
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:20,061
My business is devoted to the comfort
and beauty of the human body.

26
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:24,866
Beds, mattresses, fabrics

27
00:40:26,704 --> 00:40:29,704
clothing, cosmetics...

28
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,759
My father is the creator
of this empire.

29
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,760
He is deaf, dumb and blind.

30
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:58,333
Before making a decision 
he consults with my mothers mummy.

31
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:01,004
He puts his hand into her sex.

32
00:41:01,005 --> 00:41:04,005
If it's moist, it's "yes",
If it's dry, it's "no".

33
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:12,616
These are my wives.

34
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:15,617
I make love to them
only during working hours.

35
00:41:15,753 --> 00:41:18,753
They begin as workers,
Then I promote them to secretaries.

36
00:43:21,145 --> 00:43:23,813
We know that people want to be loved

37
00:43:23,814 --> 00:43:26,814
not for what they are,
but what they appear to be.

38
00:43:28,085 --> 00:43:31,021
so we have created a line of masks

39
00:43:31,022 --> 00:43:34,022
that have the texture, warmth

40
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:38,626
and smell of living human beings.

41
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:41,829
A customer can have any face she wants

42
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:45,934
Every face is unique and lasts a lifetime

43
00:43:47,471 --> 00:43:50,471
She can wear her artificial face to the grave.

44
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:54,909
Or make-up department for corpses
eliminates the appearance of death

45
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,181
not only do we beautify cadaverous,

46
00:43:58,182 --> 00:44:01,182
we also equip them with electronic devices.

47
00:44:01,819 --> 00:44:04,819
They can kiss their family goodbye,

48
00:44:11,662 --> 00:44:14,662
participate in their own last rites,

49
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:23,271
or give a live show.

50
00:44:35,419 --> 00:44:38,419
My mane is Isla.
My planet is Mars.

51
00:46:17,121 --> 00:46:20,121
Every morning I wake up my male secretaries.

52
00:46:29,834 --> 00:46:32,834
I manufacture and sell weapons.

53
00:46:36,073 --> 00:46:39,073
We produce bombers, hydrogen bombs,

54
00:46:39,777 --> 00:46:42,777
rayguns, deadly bacteria,

55
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:46,047
animatter waves, cancerogenic gases, etc.

56
00:47:01,665 --> 00:47:04,665
We are experimenting a drug
to create delusions of grandeur.

57
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:11,305
Another drug turns harmless people into wild beasts.

58
00:47:28,792 --> 00:47:31,792
Young generation need arms
with its marches and sittings.

59
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:46,741
We have psychedelic shotguns,

60
00:47:48,712 --> 00:47:51,712
grenade necklaces,

61
00:47:51,715 --> 00:47:54,715
rock'n'roll weapons,

62
00:47:55,419 --> 00:47:58,288
mystical weapons for Buddhists,

63
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:01,289
Jews,

64
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:04,458
and Christians.

65
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:11,199
My name is Klen.
My planet is Jupiter.

66
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:15,770
My house.

67
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:23,778
My wife.

68
00:49:13,697 --> 00:49:16,697
My chauffeur.

69
00:49:33,684 --> 00:49:35,618
My lover.

70
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:38,619
A thousand a week.

71
00:50:34,511 --> 00:50:37,511
My art factory.

72
00:50:41,919 --> 00:50:44,919
We produce a line of art every season.

73
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:50,853
We created a love machine.

74
00:51:50,854 --> 00:51:53,854
To make it live, the spectator
has to work with it. Guide it,

75
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:57,425
receive it, give himself to the act of love.

76
00:51:58,028 --> 00:52:01,028
With this electronic rod
he will rub its mechanical vagina.

77
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,900
The skill of the spectator will determine
the machines ability to reach climax.

78
00:52:39,636 --> 00:52:42,104
My chauffeur is a bad lover,

79
00:52:42,105 --> 00:52:44,240
he didn't know how to satisfy it.

80
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:47,241
But this woman...
I know her techniques very well.

81
00:52:47,578 --> 00:52:49,912
We'll produce the electronic orgasm.

82
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:52,913
Frigid!

83
00:54:04,021 --> 00:54:07,021
My name is llamo.
My planet is Saturn..

84
00:56:52,856 --> 00:56:55,856
We manufacture war toys.

85
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:22,750
Workers needed in the miniature plastic bomb shop.

86
00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:41,871
We have an electronic computer

87
00:57:41,872 --> 00:57:44,872
programmed with the politics of the government.

88
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:48,809
The government is our client.

89
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:56,550
We feed the computer data of 
coming wars and revolutions.

90
00:57:59,055 --> 00:58:02,055
It tells us what kind of toys to produce.

91
00:58:02,292 --> 00:58:05,292
to condition children from birth.

92
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:10,631
For example, if the government calculates
that it will be necessary to wage war against Peru

93
00:58:13,637 --> 00:58:16,637
our machine studies Peruvians
and tells us what to do.

94
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:23,510
We manufacture hyper-sexed brown native vampires,

95
00:58:25,215 --> 00:58:28,215
who can only be destroyed
by a cross the colour of white skin

96
00:58:29,085 --> 00:58:32,085
We create a laxative that induces vomiting,

97
00:58:32,489 --> 00:58:35,489
We name it after the capital of Peru
an tint with the color of the natives.

98
00:58:37,327 --> 00:58:40,327
We started a comic book campaign

99
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:07,623
For fifteen years in advance

100
00:59:07,624 --> 00:59:10,624
we condition the children
to hate the future enemy.

101
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:52,799
In fifteen years these children
will go off to war

102
00:59:53,803 --> 00:59:56,803
to kill Peruvians With pleasure.

103
01:00:01,778 --> 01:00:04,778
My name is Berg.
My planet is Uranus.

104
01:01:31,534 --> 01:01:34,534
That window is wrong sized.

105
01:01:34,537 --> 01:01:36,472
I don't like it.

106
01:01:36,473 --> 01:01:39,473
Berg. Why do we have that enormous hole in the wall?

107
01:01:42,645 --> 01:01:45,645
Close it up!

108
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,980
Our little baby is hungry.

109
01:03:26,483 --> 01:03:29,483
- Have you finished the report?
- No.

110
01:03:52,141 --> 01:03:55,141
The president wants the report.
Hurry up! Hurry!

111
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:17,430
I am financial advisor to the president.

112
01:04:38,788 --> 01:04:41,056
"To save the country's economy

113
01:04:41,057 --> 01:04:44,057
we must eliminate four million citizens
in the next five years."

114
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:54,100
Begin the operations of the gas chambers,

115
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:57,571
gas schools, gas universities,
gas libraries, gas museums,

116
01:04:59,309 --> 01:05:02,309
gas dance halls and gas whore houses, et cetera.

117
01:06:08,811 --> 01:06:11,811
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!

118
01:06:16,019 --> 01:06:19,019
My name is Axon.
My planet is Neptune.

119
01:06:19,656 --> 01:06:22,656
I am the chief of police.

120
01:07:29,325 --> 01:07:32,325
This is the most beautiful day
of your life.

121
01:07:32,362 --> 01:07:35,362
Of your own free will you came to 
surrender a part of your body to me.

122
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,600
You decided to undergo the initiation

123
01:07:40,636 --> 01:07:43,636
that 999 other heroes
have passed.

124
01:07:55,251 --> 01:07:58,251
Your sacrifice completes
my sanctuary of one thousand testicles.

125
01:08:14,971 --> 01:08:17,971
This is the Holy Book.
Learn to believe in me.

126
01:10:43,886 --> 01:10:46,886
Axon is the truth, and the power and the light.

127
01:10:54,797 --> 01:10:57,797
My name is Lut.
My planet is Pluto.

128
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:02,435
My business is architecture.

129
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:04,230
When we built this multi-family complex
we made a big mistake.

130
01:12:05,668 --> 01:12:08,668
We lost money.

131
01:12:09,071 --> 01:12:12,071
We gave them small gardens and windows,
we installed water, 

132
01:12:12,441 --> 01:12:14,476
lighting and heating systems.

133
01:12:14,477 --> 01:12:17,477
This was a wrong concept.

134
01:12:18,648 --> 01:12:21,648
A man doesn't need a home,
all he needs is a shelter.

135
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:25,351
If we can sell him on the idea of a shelter
we can make millions.

136
01:12:47,877 --> 01:12:50,877
Worker will come here only to sleep.
He won't need electricity or water.

137
01:12:53,082 --> 01:12:56,082
You won't have to cook.
We'll condition him to eat at the factory.

138
01:12:59,755 --> 01:13:02,755
These are communal latrine trucks
for the entire building.

139
01:15:44,553 --> 01:15:47,553
You have power and money,
but you are mortal.

140
01:15:49,658 --> 01:15:52,594
You know you can not escape death.

141
01:15:52,595 --> 01:15:55,595
But immortality can be obtained.

142
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:03,769
In all traditions
they speak of Holy Mountains.

143
01:16:05,507 --> 01:16:08,507
The Meru mountain of India.

144
01:16:10,779 --> 01:16:13,779
The mount Kuen-Luen of the Taoist.

145
01:16:14,984 --> 01:16:17,984
The Karakorum of the Himalaya.

146
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:21,454
The mountain of the Philosophers.

147
01:16:21,457 --> 01:16:23,825
The Rosicrucian mountain.

148
01:16:23,826 --> 01:16:26,826
The cabalistic mountain 
Of San Giovanni della Cross.

149
01:16:27,096 --> 01:16:30,096
The are many other other Holy Mountains.

150
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:33,399
The legend is always the same one.

151
01:16:33,402 --> 01:16:36,402
Nine immortal men live on top of the mountain.

152
01:16:37,506 --> 01:16:40,506
From the highest peak they direct our world.

153
01:16:40,576 --> 01:16:43,576
They hold the secret
to the conquest of death.

154
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:48,314
They are more than forty thousand years old,

155
01:16:49,652 --> 01:16:52,553
they were once like ourselves.

156
01:16:52,554 --> 01:16:55,554
If others have succeeded conquering death,

157
01:16:55,891 --> 01:16:58,693
why must we accept it?

158
01:16:58,694 --> 01:17:01,694
I know where the immortals live
and how to obtain their secret.

159
01:17:08,604 --> 01:17:11,604
In this ancient Rosicrucian manuscript

160
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:14,740
I found an etching of the nine immortals
and the place where they live.

161
01:17:16,979 --> 01:17:19,979
The Holy Mountain of Lotus island.

162
01:17:20,115 --> 01:17:23,115
Some men join forces to assault banks
and steal money - pieces of paper.

163
01:17:25,721 --> 01:17:28,721
We should unite our forces
to assault the Holy Mountain

164
01:17:31,727 --> 01:17:34,727
and rob its wise men of secret of immortality.

165
01:17:35,731 --> 01:17:38,499
but to conquer the wisdom of immortals

166
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,835
we too must become wise men.

167
01:17:40,836 --> 01:17:43,836
The elements of chemistry are many but finite.

168
01:17:46,008 --> 01:17:49,008
So are the techniques of enlightenment.

169
01:17:49,645 --> 01:17:52,645
To reach it more quickly
we will combine the techniques.

170
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:57,550
With the correct formula
any human being can become enlightened.

171
01:18:02,524 --> 01:18:05,524
The immortals are a group.

172
01:18:06,295 --> 01:18:09,295
If we are to succeed,
we must seize to be individuals

173
01:18:09,998 --> 01:18:12,998
and become a collective being.

174
01:18:31,253 --> 01:18:34,253
Burn your money.

175
01:19:52,067 --> 01:19:55,067
If you don't want to die,
kill your money 

176
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:14,320
We shall destroy self-image
unsteady, wavery,

177
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:17,690
bewilder, full of desire,

178
01:20:18,827 --> 01:20:21,827
distracted, confused.

179
01:20:23,365 --> 01:20:26,365
When the self-concept thinks:
"This is I" and "That is mine"

180
01:20:29,505 --> 01:20:32,505
he binds himself
and he forgets the great self.

181
01:22:55,617 --> 01:22:58,617
- The feet stink like a rotten dog.
- He has beautiful teeth.

182
01:22:59,554 --> 01:23:02,554
I can't stand the smell!

183
01:23:22,244 --> 01:23:25,244
When he'll put all your bones back together
you will like his smell.

184
01:23:37,092 --> 01:23:40,092
Man learned to cultivate the earth
by weakening the plants.

185
01:23:42,631 --> 01:23:45,631
Wild plants remain as they were
at the moment of creation.

186
01:23:47,469 --> 01:23:50,469
They are the humble guardians of the secret.

187
01:24:43,725 --> 01:24:46,725
The flower knows.

188
01:24:47,262 --> 01:24:50,262
You don't need to ask it.

189
01:26:24,192 --> 01:26:27,192
The dog will take your senses away with him.

190
01:26:28,129 --> 01:26:31,129
He can't see for you.

191
01:26:39,507 --> 01:26:42,507
The delicate scent of flowers.
It is the fragrance of the universe.

192
01:26:44,446 --> 01:26:47,446
I eat the flower
And its perfume is my blood.

193
01:26:49,217 --> 01:26:52,217
Together we form a dog
in search of the sacred flower.

194
01:26:56,191 --> 01:26:59,191
Together we form a flower
in search of the sacred water.

195
01:27:03,832 --> 01:27:06,832
This is the moment
when the word is made flesh.

196
01:27:35,397 --> 01:27:38,065
How many people are you?

197
01:27:38,066 --> 01:27:41,066
One, two, three, four, five...

198
01:27:41,770 --> 01:27:43,370
We are nine.

199
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:46,307
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

200
01:27:46,308 --> 01:27:49,308
- One is missing.
- Yes.

201
01:27:59,254 --> 01:28:02,254
Here's the missing one, he drowned.

202
01:28:16,705 --> 01:28:19,705
He drowned.

203
01:29:03,551 --> 01:29:06,551
This is the ceremony of death.

204
01:29:06,654 --> 01:29:09,654
The grave receives you with love.

205
01:29:09,924 --> 01:29:12,924
Surrender yourself to death.

206
01:29:13,461 --> 01:29:16,461
Return what was loaned to you.

207
01:29:17,132 --> 01:29:20,132
Give up your pleasures, your pains.

208
01:29:20,735 --> 01:29:23,735
Give up your friends, your lovers.

209
01:29:24,205 --> 01:29:27,205
Give up your family, your past.

210
01:29:28,376 --> 01:29:31,376
Surrender what you hate,
what you desire.

211
01:29:33,014 --> 01:29:35,616
You will know nothingness.

212
01:29:35,617 --> 01:29:38,552
It is the only reality.

213
01:29:38,553 --> 01:29:41,553
Don't be afraid. It's so easy to give.

214
01:29:42,590 --> 01:29:45,590
You're not alone. You have a grave.

215
01:29:46,027 --> 01:29:48,595
It is your first mother.

216
01:29:48,596 --> 01:29:51,596
The grave is the door to your rebirth.
Now you will surrender

217
01:29:52,701 --> 01:29:55,701
the faithful animal
you once called your body.

218
01:29:59,107 --> 01:30:01,208
Don't try to keep it, 

219
01:30:01,209 --> 01:30:04,209
remember - it was a loan.

220
01:30:05,113 --> 01:30:08,113
Surrender your legs,
surrender your sex,

221
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:11,650
Your head, your blood,
Your organs, your bones.

222
01:30:14,556 --> 01:30:16,857
You no longer want to possess.

223
01:30:16,858 --> 01:30:19,693
Possession is the ultimate pain.

224
01:30:19,694 --> 01:30:22,629
The earth falls over your corpse.

225
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:25,265
She comes to cover you with love.

226
01:30:25,266 --> 01:30:28,266
Because she is your true flesh.

227
01:30:28,636 --> 01:30:31,605
Now you are an empty heart,

228
01:30:31,606 --> 01:30:34,606
open to receive your true essence,

229
01:30:35,410 --> 01:30:38,410
your own perfection,
your new body, 

230
01:30:39,414 --> 01:30:42,414
which is the universe, the work of God.

231
01:30:43,718 --> 01:30:46,718
You will be born again, you will be real.

232
01:30:47,255 --> 01:30:50,255
You will be your own father,
your own mother,

233
01:30:50,759 --> 01:30:53,759
your own son,
Your own perfection.

234
01:30:54,362 --> 01:30:57,362
Open your eyes.
You are the earth, you are the green,

235
01:30:58,133 --> 01:31:01,133
You are the blue, you are the others!
You are the essence.

236
01:31:02,804 --> 01:31:05,804
Look at the flower.
Look at the flower.

237
01:31:06,674 --> 01:31:09,674
For the first time. Look at the flower.

238
01:31:11,045 --> 01:31:14,045
Now you are a group.

239
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:11,770
Do you want to perform miracles like Christ?

240
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:15,740
See what would happen if you did.

241
01:33:34,789 --> 01:33:37,357
Concentrate on this starfish.

242
01:33:37,358 --> 01:33:40,358
When you see it the size of an elephant,
you will never miss the target.

243
01:33:48,803 --> 01:33:51,405
Our thoughts have forms.

244
01:33:51,406 --> 01:33:54,406
You have a monster in your mind.

245
01:33:54,742 --> 01:33:57,742
We will help you.

246
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:52,230
Throw that monster into the water!

247
01:35:11,619 --> 01:35:14,619
He can't swim, he will drown.

248
01:35:15,423 --> 01:35:18,423
Fool! Destroy your illusions.

249
01:35:19,861 --> 01:35:22,861
Free yourself from the past.

250
01:35:41,883 --> 01:35:44,883
We have crossed the great waters.

251
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:20,819
Bravo! Congratulations!
You made it to our shores. Oh, this deserves a toast.

252
01:36:21,689 --> 01:36:24,689
You're not the first to come to Lotus island
in search of the Holy Mountain.

253
01:36:31,999 --> 01:36:34,999
I drink alone.
Because the newcomers are always abstainers.

254
01:36:36,037 --> 01:36:39,037
In time they realize 
that the best liquor in the world

255
01:36:39,273 --> 01:36:42,273
is at the Pantheon Bar!

256
01:36:42,877 --> 01:36:45,877
Come, come, come.
I have everything.

257
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:49,180
Food, drinks, beds, baths, men, women...

258
01:37:25,319 --> 01:37:28,319
These illustrious travelers
came here to find the Holy Mountain,

259
01:37:29,190 --> 01:37:32,190
but they preferred the Pantheon Bar!

260
01:37:36,163 --> 01:37:38,832
The real Holy Mountain is here,

261
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:41,833
In my words, in my poems.

262
01:37:42,603 --> 01:37:45,603
If I write "rose", it blooms in my hand

263
01:37:47,542 --> 01:37:50,542
and the bees come to feed on my poetry.

264
01:37:55,917 --> 01:37:58,917
Our bees make honey,
but your flies make shit.

265
01:38:06,194 --> 01:38:09,194
The Cross was a mushroom

266
01:38:11,832 --> 01:38:14,832
and the mushroom was also
the Tree of Good and Evil.

267
01:38:18,172 --> 01:38:21,172
The Philosophical stone of the alchemists

268
01:38:23,744 --> 01:38:26,744
...was... LSD.

269
01:38:36,257 --> 01:38:39,257
The Book of the Dead is a trip 

270
01:38:40,695 --> 01:38:43,695
and the Apocalypse describes
a masculine experience.

271
01:38:55,343 --> 01:38:58,343
In these flasks

272
01:38:59,447 --> 01:39:02,447
are all the Holy Mountains.

273
01:39:04,218 --> 01:39:07,218
and in this beautiful young man

274
01:39:08,723 --> 01:39:11,723
is eternity!

275
01:39:14,562 --> 01:39:16,763
To conquer a mountain is easy.

276
01:39:16,764 --> 01:39:19,764
I can go through solid matter.

277
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:28,039
Nothing stops me!

278
01:39:28,542 --> 01:39:31,542
In a minute I will cross the Holy Mountain.
Wait for me here.

279
01:39:34,715 --> 01:39:37,715
I got to the other side of the mountain
in less than a minute.

280
01:39:37,752 --> 01:39:40,752
- How long till you reach the summit?
- I don't know. I can only advance horizontally.

281
01:39:43,758 --> 01:39:45,692
And that's enough.

282
01:39:45,693 --> 01:39:48,561
From bottom the top I can't do,

283
01:39:48,562 --> 01:39:51,331
But anyway, I am a champion!

284
01:39:51,332 --> 01:39:54,267
I conquered the Holy Mountain Horizontally!

285
01:39:54,268 --> 01:39:57,268
I am a champion!

286
01:39:57,772 --> 01:40:00,106
I founded the academy! I give you awards!

287
01:40:00,107 --> 01:40:02,175
Here you can win a trophy every year!

288
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:05,176
Idiots, you don't know what you are losing!

289
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:09,180
You could have made history,
and we are already forgetting you!

290
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:52,290
Help me!
I can't go one step farther.

291
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:56,060
You are not afraid of falling,
what frightens you is climbing.

292
01:40:57,064 --> 01:41:00,064
- Rub your clitoris against the mountain!
- You're terrified of success!

293
01:41:00,968 --> 01:41:03,968
Give yourself to the world!

294
01:41:47,982 --> 01:41:50,982
I can't lie anymore.
My hand is frozen!

295
01:41:55,456 --> 01:41:58,224
You were never able to forget your body,

296
01:41:58,225 --> 01:42:01,127
never able to pry yourself from that love

297
01:42:01,128 --> 01:42:04,128
and now the thing you love most
is stopping you from reaching the top.

298
01:42:05,032 --> 01:42:08,032
You must sacrifice part of your body.

299
01:42:11,405 --> 01:42:14,405
Cut off your fingers or go back.

300
01:42:43,337 --> 01:42:46,337
We have mastered
the difficult part of the mountain.

301
01:42:48,075 --> 01:42:51,075
Now the way we be like a garden.

302
01:42:51,312 --> 01:42:54,312
Nevertheless at this height
our mind will decompose,

303
01:42:56,584 --> 01:42:59,352
and we will suffer the vision of death.

304
01:42:59,353 --> 01:43:02,353
- Lies!
- If you don't believe, wait for us here.

305
01:43:04,425 --> 01:43:07,425
When I return
I will show you the difficult way.

306
01:47:29,890 --> 01:47:32,890
Meditate here for three hours
before you attack them.

307
01:47:32,926 --> 01:47:35,926
And you?

308
01:47:36,997 --> 01:47:39,997
You don't need a master now.

309
01:47:40,334 --> 01:47:43,334
You can win by yourself.
Goodbye.

310
01:47:52,412 --> 01:47:55,412
This is the way we must reach the summit.

311
01:47:55,916 --> 01:47:58,916
Then we will master our bodies.

312
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:02,355
If you know what you must do,

313
01:48:02,356 --> 01:48:05,356
you don't need anyone.
You are the master.

314
01:48:07,494 --> 01:48:10,494
Cut off my head.

315
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:46,230
Now you can begin to learn.

316
01:48:57,845 --> 01:49:00,845
Unite yourself with this wood woman

317
01:49:01,114 --> 01:49:04,114
who came here
only because she loves you.

318
01:49:08,922 --> 01:49:11,922
Forget the summits.
Reach eternity through love.

319
01:49:14,027 --> 01:49:16,529
Return to your country.

320
01:49:16,530 --> 01:49:19,530
I leave you my tower
and my alchemical rooms.

321
01:49:20,934 --> 01:49:23,603
Teach your family and your people.

322
01:49:23,604 --> 01:49:26,604
Change the world.

323
01:50:13,086 --> 01:50:16,086
Sit down.

324
01:50:25,632 --> 01:50:28,632
I promised you the great secret
and I will not disappoint you.

325
01:50:38,979 --> 01:50:41,914
Is this the end of our adventure?

326
01:50:41,915 --> 01:50:44,915
Nothing has an end.

327
01:50:44,985 --> 01:50:47,985
We came in search of secret of immortality.

328
01:50:48,588 --> 01:50:51,023
To be like Gods.

329
01:50:51,024 --> 01:50:54,024
and here we are, mortals,

330
01:50:54,461 --> 01:50:57,461
more human than ever.

331
01:50:58,031 --> 01:51:01,031
If we have not obtained immorality,

332
01:51:01,335 --> 01:51:04,335
at least we have obtained reality.

333
01:51:04,705 --> 01:51:07,705
We began in a fairytale
and we came to life,

334
01:51:09,476 --> 01:51:12,476
but... is this life reality?

335
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:15,648
No.

336
01:51:15,649 --> 01:51:18,649
It is a film.
Zoom back camera.

337
01:51:27,761 --> 01:51:30,761
We are images, dreams, photographs.

338
01:51:34,201 --> 01:51:37,036
We must not stay here.

339
01:51:37,037 --> 01:51:38,971
Prisoners!

340
01:51:38,972 --> 01:51:41,972
We shall break the illusion.

341
01:51:41,975 --> 01:51:44,975
This is magic!

342
01:51:52,486 --> 01:51:55,321
Goodbye to the Holy Mountain.

343
01:51:55,322 --> 01:51:58,322
Real life awaits us.
