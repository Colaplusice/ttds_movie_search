1
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:54,678
l've come back.

2
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:02,243
Give me a drink, Brother Kipling.

3
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:11,129
Don't you know me?

4
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:14,964
No. l don't know you.

5
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:18,126
Who are you?

6
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:20,687
What can l do for you?

7
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:24,478
l told you. Give me a drink.

8
00:04:55,769 --> 00:05:00,968
lt was all settled.
Right here, in this office.

9
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,567
Remember?

10
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:10,406
Danny and me signed the contract
and you witnessed it.

11
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,281
You...

12
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:16,040
...stood over there.

13
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:20,125
l stood there.

14
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:23,288
And Daniel stood here.

15
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:26,448
Remember?

16
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,842
Carnehan!

17
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:36,202
Peachy Taliaferro Carnehan.

18
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,246
Of course.

19
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:43,648
Keep looking at me. lt helps
to keep my soul from flying off.

20
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:45,447
Carnehan!

21
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:48,919
The same, and not the same,
who sat beside you...

22
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:53,207
...in a first-class carriage
on the train to Marwar Junction...

23
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:57,687
...three summers
and a thousand years ago.

24
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:08,399
Jodhpur, please.

25
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,202
Blast!

26
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:50,924
All aboard!

27
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:08,401
May l?

28
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:14,760
Riding in this ashcart is like being
kicked by a mule every 10 minutes!

29
00:08:38,489 --> 00:08:40,445
Mr. Clutterbury Das.

30
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:45,160
Failed entrance examination,
Calcutta University, 1863.

31
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:49,163
Writer of correspondence
for the illiterate general public.

32
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,557
Shut up!

33
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:52,367
Thank you, sir.

34
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:44,839
-Out of the window, Babu!
-Thank you, sir.

35
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:48,688
Outside, you inky-fingered thief!

36
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:51,807
-l hope you break your neck!
-Thank you, sir.

37
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:55,644
-You might have killed him!
-Serves him right if l had!

38
00:09:55,929 --> 00:10:00,127
-We're not making five miles an hour.
-But why?

39
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:06,086
-l caught him stealing your watch.
-My watch?

40
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:09,478
l say, it is my watch!

41
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:12,247
Well!

42
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:16,887
l'm very much obliged to you, Mr...?

43
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:21,888
Carnehan. Former gunnery sergeant
in Her Majesty's Forces.

44
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:23,448
Mine's Kipling.

45
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:27,438
-May l offer you a drink?
-l don't mind if l do.

46
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:35,722
You've knocked about lndia a bit,
l take it.

47
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:40,280
You can say that twice!
On foot, on horseback and on camel.

48
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:43,805
-You don't look green, either.
-l was born in lndia.

49
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:48,599
Great country, or was till bureaucrats
took over and ruined everything.

50
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:51,277
-l hope you're not one of them!
-No.

51
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:52,677
l didn't think so.

52
00:10:52,849 --> 00:10:56,285
They usually have long noses
for looking down at you.

53
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:59,680
And l've yet to have
one of them offer me a drink!

54
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:04,525
-Glenlivet, 12 years old.
-You've an educated taste.

55
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:08,762
l have an educated taste in whiskey,
women, waistcoats and bills of fare.

56
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:11,523
But l've had few chances
to ex ercise it.

57
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:14,522
Because them that governs
make up laws...

58
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:17,442
...to stop men like us
from getting anywhere.

59
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:20,248
Whose loss is it?
England's, of course!

60
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:24,766
lf we were unrestrained, she wouldn't
get 70 millions in revenue...

61
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:29,320
-...it would be 700 millions! Right?
-l quite agree, yes.

62
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,726
-Where are you heading for?
-Jodhpur.

63
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:35,926
-Will you return on this line?
-ln 10 days.

64
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:39,479
Can you make it eight?
l have a message for a man...

65
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,846
...travelling through Marwar Junction
on the 24th.

66
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:46,001
He expects to meet
but l have urgent business.

67
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:48,637
l'm sorry, l can't help you there.

68
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,198
Supposing l was to ask you...

69
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:55,806
...as a stranger going to the West
to seek for that which was lost.

70
00:11:55,969 --> 00:11:58,199
What would you say then?

71
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:01,042
l should answer,
where do you come from?

72
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:02,198
From the East.

73
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:06,123
l am hoping that you will give
my message on the square...

74
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:08,564
...for the sake of the widow's son.

75
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:14,125
-Which lodge do you hail from?
-Travelling Lodge 3276, Fore and Fit.

76
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:18,760
The Queen's Own Royal Loyal Light
lnfantry, Regimental District 329A.

77
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:21,809
-To whom is the message?
-Daniel Dravot.

78
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:25,041
-Dravot.
-A big man with long gray sideboards.

79
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:26,244
A great swell.

80
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:29,799
You'll find him
in a first-class compartment.

81
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:31,118
Don't be af raid.

82
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:35,805
Slip the window down and say,
'' Peachy's gone south for the week.''

83
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,162
-'' Peachy's gone south for the week.''
-Yes, and he'll tumble.

84
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:44,959
Well, l'll be getting off now
before we reach the station.

85
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:50,522
By the way, Brother Carnehan....

86
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:54,565
l missed my watch
in the station at Lahore...

87
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:57,323
...before boarding the train.

88
00:12:57,489 --> 00:13:00,686
How was l to know you were a Mason?

89
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:27,681
What's this?

90
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,409
God's holy trousers!
Tickets again?

91
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:32,685
ls your name Dravot, sir?

92
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:41,242
l'm to say that Peachy
has gone south for the week.

93
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,439
He's gone south for the week.

94
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:52,806
Did he say l'd give anything for this?
l won't.

95
00:13:52,969 --> 00:13:55,529
-No, he didn't.
-Then why did you do it?

96
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:58,601
For the sake of the widow's son.

97
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,644
-He said south, did he?
-Yes.

98
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,084
Then that'll be Degumber.

99
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:08,888
Since you're Peachy's pal,
l'll tell you.

100
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:13,998
We're gonna put the screw on the rajah
for what he did to his mother-in-law.

101
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:17,479
Filled her with peppers
and flogged her to death.

102
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:20,797
You mean you intend to blackmail him?

103
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:26,327
You wouldn't get out alive! lf they
don't cut your throat, they'll poison you.

104
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:29,720
Both's been tried.
Peachy and me don't kill easy!

105
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:33,438
The rajah's an independent ruler.
He answers to nobody.

106
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:35,964
How will you put the screw on him?

107
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:39,917
By telling him we're correspondents
for The Northern Star.

108
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:43,968
You can't! You can't do that!

109
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:48,327
Because l am the correspondent
of The Northern Star!

110
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:52,887
-You what?
-l'm the correspondent!

111
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:56,325
Eh? What did you say, brother?

112
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:05,284
As you know,
we took them at the Degumber border...

113
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:08,407
...so there's a question
of jurisdiction.

114
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:12,244
But a charge of conspiracy
to blackmail might be brought.

115
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:16,880
l didn't lay this information before
you as a criminal prosecution.

116
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,005
Only to save their lives.

117
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:23,321
May l ask what particular interest
you have in these scoundrels?

118
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,038
Well, they happen to be...

119
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,245
...Freemasons. Like myself.

120
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:33,448
Freemasons? Them? l'd think
you'd strike them off your roll!

121
00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:36,203
Oh, once a Mason, always a Mason.

122
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:41,489
Never could understand how
pukka chaps like you can go about...

123
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,927
...wearing aprons and sashes
and shaking hands with strangers.

124
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:48,041
What is Masonry, Kipling?

125
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:49,927
lt's an ancient order...

126
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:54,287
...dedicated to the brotherhood
of man, under the eye of God.

127
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:59,046
We should have left that behind
in England. lt can never work here.

128
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,884
There are tales that it did work here,
before we came.

129
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:05,688
Some audacious scholars
can trace it...

130
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:08,363
...to the builders
of Solomon's Temple.

131
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:14,320
-Old wives' tales, l suspect.
-Yes, in all likelihood, sir.

132
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:20,041
Well, let's have a look
at your lodge brothers.

133
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:26,928
Right turn.

134
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,322
Halt.

135
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:34,367
Hats off!

136
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:38,124
You men are not under arrest...

137
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:43,443
...thanks to Mr. Kipling, who's a real
correspondent for The Northern Star.

138
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:47,688
But both of you richly deserve
to be in jail.

139
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:50,398
l have your records before me.

140
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:53,800
There's everything
from smuggling to swindling...

141
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:57,279
...receiving stolen goods
and barefaced blackmail!

142
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,440
l resent the accusation.

143
00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:03,238
lt is blackmail to threaten
to publish information.

144
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:07,527
What blackmail is there in accepting
a retainer to keep it out?

145
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:09,839
How did you propose to do that?

146
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:13,638
Telling the editor what l know
about his sister...

147
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:16,448
...and a certain government official.

148
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:20,727
Let him put that in his paper
if he has need of news!

149
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:27,685
You should have gone home
after your army service.

150
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:31,046
To what? A porter's uniform
outside a restaurant?

151
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:35,327
Tips for closing cab doors
on civilians and their blowzy women?

152
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:38,720
Not for us, after watching
Af ghans take command...

153
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:42,199
-...when the officers had copped it!
-Well said!

154
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:47,568
There may be no criminal charges, but
l'll see these files reach Calcutta...

155
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:51,722
...with the advice you be
deported as political undesirables.

156
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:54,608
Detriments to the empire and the raj.

157
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:57,203
Detriments you call us? Detriments?

158
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:02,921
Detriments like us built this bloody
empire and the izzat of the raj!

159
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:04,926
Hats on!

160
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:07,086
About turn!

161
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:10,287
By the left, quick march!

162
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:13,967
Left turn!

163
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:23,882
There's no need to let any of this
get into the Star, l take it, Kipling?

164
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:25,880
No, no, no.

165
00:18:31,129 --> 00:18:32,642
Copy.

166
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:05,803
My God! You two!
What do you want this time?

167
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:09,598
-We want to ask you a favour.
-Another favour?

168
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:14,047
Calm down, we've never taken
advantage of a fellow in the craft.

169
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:16,928
We don't want money,
just a little time...

170
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:20,286
...a look at a book or two,
a study of your maps.

171
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:23,486
We'll take a drink, but if not,
we won't mind.

172
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:27,688
Peachy is as sober as l am.
lt's important you have no doubts.

173
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:34,243
So we'll take one of your cigars
apiece, and you shall watch us...

174
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:36,081
...light up.

175
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:47,478
And now, sir...

176
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:52,404
...let me introduce you to Brother
Peachy Carnehan, which is him...

177
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:57,085
...and Brother Daniel Dravot,
which is l.

178
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:01,927
The less said about our jobs,
the better. We've been most things.

179
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:06,924
We've been all over lndia. We know
her cities, jungles, jails and passes.

180
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:10,206
We have decided
she isn't big enough for us.

181
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:12,360
The commissioner said that.

182
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:14,520
We're going to another place...

183
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:18,238
...where a man isn't crowded
and can come into his own.

184
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:21,924
We're not little men,
so we're going away to be kings.

185
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,759
-Kings of Kafiristan.
-Oh, Kafiristan.

186
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:30,559
We hear they have two and 30 idols
there. So we'll be the 33rd and 34th.

187
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:35,361
lt's a place of warring tribes,
meaning a land of opportunity...

188
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:38,760
...for such who can train
and lead men in battle.

189
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:41,807
We'll go there
and say to any chief we find:

190
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:45,962
''Want to vanquish your foes?''
He'll say, ''Of course, do it.''

191
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:49,758
We'll fight for him, make him king
and then subvert him.

192
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:53,638
We'll seize his royal throne
and loot the country.

193
00:20:53,849 --> 00:20:56,317
How's that for a plan?

194
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:59,808
You're both out of your minds!

195
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:03,880
To start with...

196
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:09,559
...the only way to get there
is through Af ghanistan.

197
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:12,848
Kafiristan? No, no, no.

198
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:18,879
Two white men would be cut to pieces
five miles into the Khyber Pass.

199
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:22,325
Just suppose we managed it.
Just suppose.

200
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:26,084
And suppose we got across
the Af ghan plains, then what?

201
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:31,721
There's the Hindu Kush,
a f rozen sea of peaks and glaciers.

202
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:36,804
A party of geographers tried several
years ago and vanished into thin air.

203
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:41,360
No white man has ever been there
and come out since Alexander.

204
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:43,406
Alexander who?

205
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:47,608
Alexander the Great, king of Greece.
300 years before Christ.

206
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:50,567
lf a Greek can do it, we can do it.

207
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:52,082
Right.

208
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:57,082
l can only repeat,
you're a pair of lunatics!

209
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:01,800
Would a pair of lunatics
draw up a contract like this?

210
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:08,045
''This contract between us, pursuing
and witnesseth in the name of God.

211
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:12,885
One: We will settle this together,
i.e., to be kings of Kafiristan.

212
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:17,201
Two: We will not, while this
is being settled, look at liquor...

213
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,840
...or any woman, so as to get mix ed
up with one or the other harmf ul.

214
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,762
Three: We act
with dignity and discretion.

215
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:29,605
lf one is in trouble, the other stays
by him. Signed by us this day.''

216
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:34,001
There's no need for the last article,
but it's got a ring to it.

217
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:36,128
Daniel.

218
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:10,725
Now, you witness it and it's legal.

219
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:30,002
Well, gentlemen,
it's 4 in the morning.

220
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:35,926
Don't stand on politeness. lf you want
to go to bed, we won't steal anything.

221
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:37,158
Thank you.

222
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:41,959
We'll send word when we're ready
to go, if you want to say goodbye.

223
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:46,168
Yes. Well, try not to burn
the place down.

224
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:52,086
Here we are.

225
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:57,525
'' Kafiristan. 10, 000 square miles.
Mountainous terrain.

226
00:23:57,689 --> 00:24:00,567
Religion unknown. Population unknown.

227
00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:04,483
Conquered by Alexander in 328 B.C.

228
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:10,167
According to Herodotus,
he defeated King Oxyartes...

229
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:16,006
...whose daughter Roxanne
he subsequently took to wife.''

230
00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:27,483
You buy from me,
l give you good price.

231
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:31,847
Very cheap, very nice things for you,
especially for you, sir.

232
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:53,686
Our forward continuance is impeded
by this fellow, who is begging...

233
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:58,684
...you will accompany him that he may
show you a rare and wonderf ul thing.

234
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:01,841
-What thing?
-He would not say what thing.

235
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:05,001
Therefore, l suspect
his bad intentions...

236
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,400
...to entice you into
a house of disreputation...

237
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:11,800
...where he will take you,
kill you, murder you...

238
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:15,882
...cut your throat and rob the money
from your pockets also.

239
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,607
Crikey!

240
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:20,203
-Wait at the office!
-Sir, please!

241
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:23,406
Myself, l will take you
to a loving house.

242
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:26,402
You will be very happy
and delightf ul....

243
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:55,560
Morning to you, brother.

244
00:25:55,729 --> 00:25:59,039
Glad you caught the performance.
What do you think?

245
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:02,758
lt's convincing,
but what are you rascals up to now?

246
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:06,683
Last week it was kings
you were to be, of Kafiristan.

247
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:11,047
-We've gotta get there first.
-Madness is a trick.

248
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:14,519
Who'd hurt some poor crazy priest
and his servant?

249
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:17,761
Peachy worked this out.
We've used it before.

250
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:19,840
He talks, while l act dumb.

251
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:21,965
l can clown pretty good now.

252
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:25,246
l can twitch to put the fear
into any good Muslim.

253
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:27,877
l can f roth at the mouth.
Want to see?

254
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:31,644
-l can imagine.
-All right, some other time perhaps.

255
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:33,880
Come over here.

256
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:41,361
Give it a touch-up down here.

257
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:47,239
-Rifles?
-Twenty Martinis, and ammunition.

258
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:50,924
Cost us every sou we got
out of the rajah of Degumber.

259
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:54,286
Good heavens!
You mean you went back there?

260
00:26:54,449 --> 00:26:56,246
Of course, Brother Kipling.

261
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:59,048
God help you
if you're caught with those!

262
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:02,326
Gunrunning isn't exactly new to us.

263
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:06,243
Well, Brother Kipling,
goodbye and many thanks.

264
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:09,367
Man, don't do it!

265
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:11,440
The odds are too great.

266
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:15,363
Wish us luck. We met upon the level.

267
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:18,282
And we're parting on the square.

268
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:21,440
Good luck, indeed.

269
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:30,366
Come along, you ugly beast.

270
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:36,842
Wait!

271
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:43,319
Here. Take this.

272
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:08,683
Last time Danny and me came through
the Khyber Pass, we fought our way...

273
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:10,965
...yard by bloody yard...

274
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:14,439
...and General Bobbs
called us heroes afterwards.

275
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,567
But that was years ago.
Times have changed.

276
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:22,166
-Blast! Look who's on sentry!
-Mulvaney!

277
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:25,407
That loudmouthed mick
from the Black Tyrone!

278
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:29,960
Private Mulvaney! Come to attention
when l am addressing you!

279
00:28:30,129 --> 00:28:32,085
Slope arms!

280
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:36,566
Present! March!

281
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:40,085
Mark time!

282
00:28:40,249 --> 00:28:42,638
At the double!

283
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:50,848
Corporal of the guard!

284
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:55,039
Take three men and put
Private Mulvaney under arrest!

285
00:28:55,209 --> 00:28:57,643
Bloody man's drunk again!

286
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:00,846
We came through the Khyber
with that caravan...

287
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:04,240
...doing all sorts of antics
to amuse the people.

288
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,766
At night, he told them their fortunes
in a tongue of his own...

289
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:10,567
...and I translated.

290
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:12,799
And all concerned were happy...

291
00:29:12,969 --> 00:29:17,520
...because I promised them
all their wishes would come true.

292
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:33,844
Then at Jaedallak we turned off
towards Kafiristan.

293
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:39,000
They were sad to see us leave
the caravan. We'd brought it good luck.

294
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:44,926
Two she-camels had foaled and there
was no sniping at us from the hills.

295
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:49,844
They waved goodbye to the mad priest
and his servant.

296
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:53,604
And Danny danced them out of sight.

297
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:09,119
The country was deserty.
The inhabitants were dispersed, solitary.

298
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:12,486
We travelled by night
and kept away from villages.

299
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:16,881
We didn't want to waste ammunition
in idle fighting with Afghans.

300
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:02,800
The Pushtukan.

301
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:09,323
A wavy blue line on the map, but we
couldn't hope to get camels across.

302
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:14,325
So Peachy says,
''It doesn't matter what they cost...

303
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:18,807
...we'll trade them for goats.
We're playing for high stakes. ''

304
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:23,804
Major McCrimmon bet me 10 bob he could
blow up a goat skin in one breath.

305
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:28,525
He did. Though he'd sat down
on an anthill in his kilt unknowing.

306
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:31,607
Ten shillings was ten shillings
to McCrimmon!

307
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:03,322
Mules.

308
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:08,167
Now, the problem is...

309
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:13,161
...how to divide five Af ghans
from three mules...

310
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:16,799
-...and have two Englishmen left over.
-Shoot them.

311
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:20,763
No. The mules would bolt.

312
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:27,322
Sit over there, Danny.

313
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:48,481
So we starts forward into those
bitter cold mountainous parts...

314
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:52,443
...and never a path broader
than the back of your hand.

315
00:35:00,529 --> 00:35:03,487
The mountains was tall and white...

316
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:06,921
...like wild rams,
they was always fighting...

317
00:35:07,129 --> 00:35:10,724
...so you couldn't sleep
for the din of their fighting.

318
00:35:35,209 --> 00:35:37,518
For God's sake, Danny, pipe down.

319
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:41,808
-Why? Who's going to hear us?
-These mountains, that's who.

320
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:46,400
-You wanna start an avalanche?
-You don't believe that, l hope.

321
00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:50,318
lf a king can't sing,
it ain't worth being king.

322
00:35:53,249 --> 00:35:55,205
The country was mountainous...

323
00:35:55,449 --> 00:35:59,408
...and the mules was most contrary.
They all died but one.

324
00:35:59,649 --> 00:36:02,083
And she died later on.

325
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:07,160
Danny went snow-blind
and clung to jenny's tail.

326
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:11,404
Up and up we went,
and down and down.

327
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:16,165
Through defiles and over snowy saddles
till all at once...

328
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:19,846
... two giants stood in our way.

329
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:27,765
God's holy trousers.

330
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:29,567
What's the matter?

331
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:34,320
Blokes twice our size standing
guarding the snow, like. Two of them.

332
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:36,878
Give them a round apiece.

333
00:36:45,129 --> 00:36:47,245
Not a move out of them.

334
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:49,520
Stay put.

335
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:51,924
l'll reconnoitre.

336
00:36:59,729 --> 00:37:01,720
They're not real, thank God.

337
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,448
They're horrible.

338
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:08,844
Put there by the Kafiris
to f righten the neighbours.

339
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:13,447
Peachy, that means
we're in Kafiristan. Or almost.

340
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:16,205
So it does.

341
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:22,166
-What was that?
-Our bridges have been burned.

342
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,637
What do you mean?

343
00:37:24,129 --> 00:37:27,201
The bridge we crossed by
ain't there no longer.

344
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:29,601
God.

345
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:46,440
Now what?

346
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:49,079
-Tell me.
-A crevasse.

347
00:37:49,689 --> 00:37:52,442
We've had it, Danny.
Coming and going!

348
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,520
-Wide?
-Wide enough!

349
00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:58,967
lt drops into nothing below,
straight as a beggar can spit!

350
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:06,724
That's the last of them, Peachy.
No more gods to burn.

351
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:10,841
lt looks like last post, Danny.

352
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:16,766
l don't fancy dying by inches.
Feeling the cold creeping up my limbs.

353
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:20,928
-Getting all numb.
-l'll do the necessary...

354
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:24,280
-...when the fire goes out.
-Fair enough.

355
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:27,122
Bloody shame.

356
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:30,249
Getting this close and not making it.

357
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:35,204
A stone's throw away, our kingdom.

358
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:41,321
l'd have liked to seen you, Danny,
with a gold crown on your head.

359
00:38:41,529 --> 00:38:44,805
lf you could've found one
that fitted it.

360
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:50,723
Peachy, in your opinion...

361
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:54,239
...have our lives been misspent?

362
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:58,320
Well, that depends
on how you look at it.

363
00:38:58,529 --> 00:39:01,362
The world's not a better
place because of us.

364
00:39:01,569 --> 00:39:02,797
No, hardly that.

365
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:07,400
-Nobody's gonna weep at our demise.
-And who'd want them to?

366
00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:11,158
And we haven't many good deeds
to our credit.

367
00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:14,884
None. None to brag about.

368
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:17,559
But how many have been
where we've been...

369
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:21,728
-...and seen what we've seen?
-Bloody few. And that's a fact.

370
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:26,161
Even now, l wouldn't change places
with the viceroy himself...

371
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:30,521
-...if it meant giving up my memories.
-Me neither.

372
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:35,646
Remember the time the Highlanders
was retreating down the hill...

373
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:41,202
...at Ali Masjit and Pipe Major
McCrimmon got his sporran shot off?

374
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:43,485
Half a crown was in it, right?

375
00:39:43,689 --> 00:39:48,479
So he goes after it without checking
to see if that was all he'd lost!

376
00:39:48,729 --> 00:39:51,163
And then he got the Victoria Cross...

377
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:54,600
...because the Highlanders
followed him up the hill!

378
00:40:40,889 --> 00:40:44,723
Danny, we can get on!

379
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:11,167
Kafiristan.

380
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:14,120
The promised land.

381
00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:06,963
Must be their Halloween.

382
00:43:16,569 --> 00:43:19,083
Upsadaisy, lad.

383
00:43:33,009 --> 00:43:37,048
Brass band and all.
Hail the conquering heroes.

384
00:43:46,649 --> 00:43:49,721
Bloody cheek. Where's their gratitude?

385
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:52,961
l say! l say there!

386
00:43:53,169 --> 00:43:55,080
Are you Englishmen, please?

387
00:43:56,089 --> 00:43:59,399
Stone the bleeding crows!
Yes, mate.

388
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:03,206
-And who might you be?
-You just wait one jiffy.

389
00:44:24,209 --> 00:44:26,086
Peachy, it's a Gurkha.

390
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:31,366
Rifleman Machendra Gurung.
Known to my regiment as Billy Fish.

391
00:44:31,609 --> 00:44:34,362
ls that right? Well, report, rifleman.

392
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:36,759
What are you doing here?
Wherever here is.

393
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:40,998
-l come with Colonel Robertson, sir.
-The geographer?

394
00:44:41,249 --> 00:44:43,046
Oh, dear me, alas, by Jove.

395
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:46,645
Party not reaching Er-Heb
for very misfortunate reasons.

396
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:49,926
Large mountain is falling on everyone.

397
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:53,998
Everybody buried alive
ex cept your servant.

398
00:44:54,529 --> 00:44:57,760
What about them up there
banging drums...

399
00:44:58,009 --> 00:45:00,398
...and then shooting arrows at us?

400
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:02,964
Big noise to scare away devils!

401
00:45:03,209 --> 00:45:07,168
-Many devils here these days.
-They thought we was devils?

402
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:09,525
Kafiristan peoples very ignorant.

403
00:45:09,729 --> 00:45:14,405
l say to head man Ootah, l say,
''Oh, no, by Jove, they're not devils...

404
00:45:14,649 --> 00:45:17,322
...they're Gorasahibs.
British soldiers.''

405
00:45:17,529 --> 00:45:18,882
Good man, Billy Fish.

406
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:22,480
And now, if you'll take us
to this Ootah bloke...

407
00:45:22,689 --> 00:45:25,362
...we will begin his education.

408
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:44,365
People of Er-Heb, do not fear.

409
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:48,727
They are our f riends, not our enemies.

410
00:45:48,969 --> 00:45:52,325
Do you understand?
Do not fear.

411
00:45:52,529 --> 00:45:55,521
There is no need to fear.
They're our f riends.

412
00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:03,558
Why are you so af raid?
People of Er-Heb, do not fear!

413
00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:06,562
They're from England!
British soldiers!

414
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:09,323
White men.
Do not be af raid.

415
00:46:09,569 --> 00:46:11,400
Ootah!

416
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:13,162
Come on down.

417
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:18,324
No need to be af raid.
They're white men. Ootah!

418
00:46:19,169 --> 00:46:21,319
Come down!

419
00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:26,122
Don't be af raid.

420
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:44,361
Tell him we won't hurt him,
not to worry.

421
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:04,523
He wants to know where you come from.

422
00:47:04,729 --> 00:47:07,641
Tell him we tumbled from the skies.

423
00:47:13,489 --> 00:47:15,400
He wants to know, are you gods?

424
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:19,682
Not gods, Englishmen,
which is the next best thing.

425
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:26,562
l ofttimes tell Ootah
about Englishmans.

426
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:29,528
How they name dogs,
take off hats to womans...

427
00:47:29,729 --> 00:47:33,517
...and march left, right
with rifles on their shoulders.

428
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:37,517
Bringing enlightenment
to the darker regions of the earth.

429
00:47:39,169 --> 00:47:42,127
He wants to know how rifle works.

430
00:47:46,649 --> 00:47:48,321
Show him, Peachy.

431
00:48:00,569 --> 00:48:04,118
We are not gods, exactly,
but we are heaven-sent...

432
00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:07,241
...to deliver you from your enemies.

433
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:15,283
Enemies all around.

434
00:48:15,969 --> 00:48:19,279
The Bashkai are the worst.

435
00:48:22,409 --> 00:48:26,448
All town comes out and pisses
downstream when we go bathing.

436
00:48:26,689 --> 00:48:28,520
Shocking!

437
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:32,923
They are always stealing our womans.

438
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:35,567
Putting on masks.

439
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:40,963
And so our head chap
is thinking them devils...

440
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:46,408
-...and running like bloody hell away.
-War! Red war we'll give them.

441
00:48:48,289 --> 00:48:52,282
He give you two goats for each
Bashkai man you're killing.

442
00:48:55,689 --> 00:48:58,044
One goat for each womans and childs.

443
00:48:58,249 --> 00:49:01,446
Rather than knock them over
one at a time...

444
00:49:01,649 --> 00:49:03,560
...we'd like to do it
in one fell swoop.

445
00:49:03,769 --> 00:49:08,968
Serve him up a proper victory.
Storm Bashkai, take the city.

446
00:49:13,209 --> 00:49:14,927
He says, '' How much?''

447
00:49:15,169 --> 00:49:19,720
Only the honour of leading
the brave men of Er-Heb into battle.

448
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:27,358
And what we fancy in souvenirs.

449
00:49:28,089 --> 00:49:33,766
-A bauble here and a bangle there.
-Bashkai is only the beginning.

450
00:49:34,009 --> 00:49:38,844
We hope to go on from victory to
victory until he runs out of enemies.

451
00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:43,081
And a monarch of all you survey.

452
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:51,479
-All he surveys?
-From the highest place in the valley.

453
00:49:52,729 --> 00:49:56,278
The mountains will echo your name.

454
00:49:58,769 --> 00:50:03,001
Ootah the Great!

455
00:50:09,329 --> 00:50:11,559
Oh, he says he prefers
''Ootah the Terrible.''

456
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:15,597
Then Ootah the Terrible it shall be.

457
00:50:20,969 --> 00:50:24,359
And take him in token of our earnest.

458
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:31,198
And now the womans of Er-Heb
will cut his bollocks off!

459
00:50:31,449 --> 00:50:34,407
Couldn't happen in a better cause.

460
00:51:20,489 --> 00:51:22,127
-Contract.
-Contract.

461
00:51:30,889 --> 00:51:33,642
Ootah say, ''You, you no like?''

462
00:51:33,889 --> 00:51:39,600
Tell him we've given up strong drink
until we've conquered all his enemies.

463
00:51:48,329 --> 00:51:50,843
Boil them once or twice in hot water...

464
00:51:51,049 --> 00:51:53,563
...and they'll come out
like chicken and ham.

465
00:51:53,769 --> 00:51:56,761
You wouldn't know them from the
Gaiety Chorus.

466
00:52:00,129 --> 00:52:04,805
-Ootah says, ''Take your pick.''
-He does?

467
00:52:06,809 --> 00:52:12,327
Oh, tell His Majesty one's prettier
than another. l couldn't choose.

468
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:16,727
Take as many as you like.
There are more where they came from.

469
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:18,567
He has 27 daughters.

470
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:22,318
They're his daughters?
His own daughters?

471
00:52:22,569 --> 00:52:26,403
-Dirty old brute!
-Different countries, different customs.

472
00:52:26,609 --> 00:52:29,077
Mustn't be prejudiced, Peachy.

473
00:52:29,289 --> 00:52:33,885
Tell His Majesty we've also taken
a vow not to dally with females...

474
00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:37,479
...till all his enemies
are vanquished.

475
00:52:46,049 --> 00:52:50,486
He has 32 sons if you're liking boys.

476
00:52:52,129 --> 00:52:54,040
Tell him he makes my gorge rise!

477
00:52:54,289 --> 00:52:59,124
Hold on, Peachy, he's only being
hospitable according to his likes.

478
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:08,123
Polo!

479
00:53:37,209 --> 00:53:40,007
Everything's the same.
The ball's bigger.

480
00:53:40,329 --> 00:53:43,799
-ls the ball always that big?
-Depends on size of head.

481
00:53:44,009 --> 00:53:48,480
Big head, big ball.
This here Bashkai man. Big damn head.

482
00:53:48,689 --> 00:53:50,407
The bloody heathens.

483
00:53:50,649 --> 00:53:54,961
Different countries, different customs.
Mustn't be prejudiced.

484
00:53:56,409 --> 00:53:59,162
Now, listen to me,
you benighted muckers.

485
00:54:01,409 --> 00:54:05,322
We're gonna teach you soldiering,
the noblest profession.

486
00:54:06,609 --> 00:54:12,366
When we're done, you'll be able to
slaughter enemies like civilized men!

487
00:54:12,569 --> 00:54:16,608
But first, you'll have to learn
to march in step...

488
00:54:16,849 --> 00:54:20,364
...do the manual of arms
without having to think.

489
00:54:20,569 --> 00:54:24,960
Good soldiers don't think,
they just obey.

490
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:30,002
You think if a man thought twice,
he'd die for his country?

491
00:54:30,209 --> 00:54:33,918
Not bloody likely!
He wouldn't go near the battlefield!

492
00:54:34,249 --> 00:54:37,207
One look at your foolish faces...

493
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:40,998
...tells me you're going to be
crack troops.

494
00:54:41,209 --> 00:54:45,441
Him there with a 51I2 hat size
has the makings of a bloody hero.

495
00:54:54,329 --> 00:54:58,481
Timing in the British Army
has always been: ''One, two, three.''

496
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:00,801
One, two, three.

497
00:55:03,089 --> 00:55:06,399
Say after me, ''One, two, three.''

498
00:55:09,089 --> 00:55:12,286
Wait. Ready, steady, go.

499
00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:14,441
One, two, three.

500
00:55:14,689 --> 00:55:17,647
One, two, three.

501
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:23,003
Say it at the same time as the others.
Tell him to say it at the same time!

502
00:55:26,009 --> 00:55:27,567
Right. Go!

503
00:55:27,769 --> 00:55:29,327
One, two, three.

504
00:55:29,649 --> 00:55:31,162
One, two, three.

505
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:34,406
Billy, tell him to say it
with the others!

506
00:55:35,049 --> 00:55:38,564
One, two, three. Right.
Now ready, steady, go.

507
00:55:38,809 --> 00:55:40,288
One, two, three.

508
00:55:40,529 --> 00:55:43,760
No! He's saying it
before the others, Billy.

509
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:47,803
Not before them, not after them,
with them!

510
00:55:48,169 --> 00:55:51,559
Right. Attention!

511
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:54,279
No. You, look....

512
00:55:56,049 --> 00:56:00,884
That one goes to there! Say that one
goes to there! That's it!

513
00:56:02,129 --> 00:56:03,847
Down there, like that.

514
00:56:04,049 --> 00:56:06,768
There. There we are.
Okay? Right.

515
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:27,602
Come on, smarten up,
you horrible lot!

516
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:29,601
Attention!

517
00:56:29,849 --> 00:56:31,362
That's better.

518
00:56:31,609 --> 00:56:34,362
Troops, march!

519
00:56:36,849 --> 00:56:39,966
By the left. Quick. March!

520
00:56:40,169 --> 00:56:44,560
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

521
00:56:55,649 --> 00:56:59,278
Wait. You're a handsome piece,
that l don't deny...

522
00:56:59,529 --> 00:57:03,602
...but the contract states the party
of the first part, Danny...

523
00:57:03,849 --> 00:57:07,808
...and the party of the second part,
which is me...

524
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,768
...shall nowise compromise ourselves...

525
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:14,166
...with parties of the third part,
which is you.

526
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:16,564
All binding, properly sworn to...

527
00:57:17,129 --> 00:57:20,326
...witnessed and attested.

528
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:23,360
-Danny!
-So!

529
00:57:24,129 --> 00:57:26,404
Thank God you arrived.

530
00:57:26,649 --> 00:57:29,117
Let's go seek safety in battle.

531
00:57:55,529 --> 00:57:58,202
Trumpeter, sound your trumpet!

532
00:58:29,649 --> 00:58:31,241
Billy Fish.

533
00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:37,364
Blood is what we want.
The bloodier, the better.

534
00:58:37,569 --> 00:58:39,446
So it shall be!

535
00:58:42,369 --> 00:58:45,679
Like old times, Peachy.
Reminds me of Ali Majid.

536
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,961
lt's a good job the odds
are only 10 to 1 .

537
00:59:00,409 --> 00:59:01,762
Halt!

538
00:59:05,969 --> 00:59:08,961
Line up in a straight line here.

539
00:59:26,609 --> 00:59:28,565
Present!

540
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,367
Aim!

541
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:01,367
Who are they?

542
01:00:01,569 --> 01:00:03,082
What's happening?

543
01:00:03,329 --> 01:00:04,808
Very holy men.

544
01:00:05,049 --> 01:00:09,565
They walk through Kafiristan
collecting offerings for Holy City.

545
01:00:10,529 --> 01:00:14,920
Battle is postponed
until priests have passed.

546
01:00:16,369 --> 01:00:20,567
-Why are their eyes closed?
-They don't wish to see any badness...

547
01:00:20,769 --> 01:00:26,127
....so keep eyes closed until they
return to beauties of Sikandergul.

548
01:00:54,809 --> 01:00:56,162
Fire!

549
01:00:59,249 --> 01:01:01,160
Aim! Fire!

550
01:01:06,049 --> 01:01:08,961
Charge! Come on.

551
01:01:10,009 --> 01:01:13,285
Oh, that great bloody showoff!

552
01:01:13,529 --> 01:01:18,045
Rifle section, form line!
Fix bayonets!

553
01:01:37,649 --> 01:01:39,685
Advance!

554
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:42,966
Volley fire! Commence!

555
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,326
Charge!

556
01:03:20,049 --> 01:03:24,486
What did you think you were
playing at charging single-handed?

557
01:03:24,729 --> 01:03:29,359
-l got carried away. Blood was up.
-Acting like a green lieutenant...

558
01:03:29,569 --> 01:03:32,481
...hoping to be mentioned
in dispatches!

559
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:34,799
-You ought to be ashamed!
-Sorry.

560
01:03:35,049 --> 01:03:38,166
Supposing you got killed.
Where would l be at?

561
01:03:38,329 --> 01:03:40,797
-Won't happen again.
-See it don't!

562
01:03:41,009 --> 01:03:44,968
-Why are you carrying that arrow?
-No particular reason.

563
01:03:51,569 --> 01:03:52,888
Hold on!

564
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:54,767
What's he up to?

565
01:04:05,969 --> 01:04:09,484
He say he win this big battle.
According to custom...

566
01:04:09,729 --> 01:04:12,289
-...he lop off their heads.
-Great warrior?

567
01:04:12,489 --> 01:04:15,367
l never saw him in the
thick of the f ray.

568
01:04:15,569 --> 01:04:18,527
There's no prisoner ex ecutions
in this army.

569
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:21,163
Tell him to put that sword away.

570
01:04:25,769 --> 01:04:29,239
He says once sword unsheathed,
it must taste blood.

571
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:32,964
Just as l thought.
He hasn't had it out until now!

572
01:04:37,809 --> 01:04:42,166
He says watch out or he get very angry
and lop your head off.

573
01:04:53,729 --> 01:04:57,085
All right. Up you get.
Off your hunkers.

574
01:04:57,329 --> 01:05:00,127
No more grovelling.

575
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:02,445
We aren't gonna torch your city...

576
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:06,164
...or hang you in chains,
nor rape your daughters.

577
01:05:07,649 --> 01:05:13,167
Tell them to divide their goods in half
and we will choose which half we want.

578
01:05:17,409 --> 01:05:22,403
Henceforth, let the men of Er-Heb
and the men of Bashkai be as brothers.

579
01:05:23,129 --> 01:05:24,642
Brothers in arms.

580
01:05:25,049 --> 01:05:29,839
Let them march under one banner
and share in the victories to come.

581
01:05:35,569 --> 01:05:39,164
Have the Bashkai any enemies
to speak of?

582
01:05:41,569 --> 01:05:43,400
Oh, enemies all around!

583
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:46,925
Bhardoks, Ghundaras, Shus, Khawaks.

584
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:54,000
The Bhardoks piss downstream
on Bashkai people when they bathe.

585
01:05:54,249 --> 01:05:55,238
Shocking!

586
01:05:55,449 --> 01:05:58,566
We'll strike them
and grind them into dust!

587
01:06:04,209 --> 01:06:07,360
Silver bracelet, 10 shillings.

588
01:06:07,569 --> 01:06:11,960
A good heavy necklace of the same,
worth a fiver at least.

589
01:06:12,849 --> 01:06:15,158
Earring with bangles.

590
01:06:15,849 --> 01:06:19,159
One pig sticker with plain handle.

591
01:06:19,729 --> 01:06:22,960
A gold coin worn pretty thin.

592
01:06:24,569 --> 01:06:28,562
A rosy red ring
and a few other ones, plain.

593
01:06:28,769 --> 01:06:32,478
All this should fetch
10 or 15 quid in a London shop.

594
01:06:32,689 --> 01:06:35,362
Not too bad for the back of beyond.

595
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:38,006
Sikander!

596
01:06:38,249 --> 01:06:40,558
They're calling for you.

597
01:06:41,929 --> 01:06:43,760
For me?

598
01:07:04,409 --> 01:07:07,685
Sikander. Sikander.

599
01:07:07,929 --> 01:07:10,568
What does Sikander mean, Billy?

600
01:07:10,849 --> 01:07:14,558
Sikander a god. Come here
long ago from the West.

601
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:17,806
That's the bloke Kipling told us about.

602
01:07:18,049 --> 01:07:19,402
Alexander?

603
01:07:19,649 --> 01:07:21,128
Alexander. Sikander.

604
01:07:22,129 --> 01:07:23,562
Here.

605
01:07:23,769 --> 01:07:26,602
-Alexander.
-He builded great city.

606
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:30,484
Sikandergul, high in mountains.
Sit on throne.

607
01:07:30,729 --> 01:07:32,367
All people worship him.

608
01:07:32,569 --> 01:07:36,562
Then one day, time comes,
he say he must go to East.

609
01:07:36,769 --> 01:07:39,567
People pull their hair out,
tear clothes.

610
01:07:39,769 --> 01:07:43,364
So Sikander promised to send back son.

611
01:07:43,609 --> 01:07:46,919
328 B.C., encyclopaedia said.

612
01:07:47,929 --> 01:07:52,957
They saw arrow go into Danny's chest,
him pluck it out, and not bleeding.

613
01:07:54,329 --> 01:07:55,398
So?

614
01:07:55,609 --> 01:07:59,158
So, son of Sikander.

615
01:07:59,569 --> 01:08:01,161
They think l'm a god?

616
01:08:04,569 --> 01:08:08,926
A god! Put your foot out
that l may kiss your big toe.

617
01:08:09,609 --> 01:08:13,079
-You may kiss my royal arse.
-Not royal, holy!

618
01:08:13,329 --> 01:08:15,763
-You're a deity, remember?
-Peachy.

619
01:08:15,969 --> 01:08:19,598
-Yes, Billy?
-ls Danny not son of Sikander?

620
01:08:19,849 --> 01:08:24,479
No, he's a man like us. He can
break wind at both ends simultaneous.

621
01:08:24,689 --> 01:08:27,408
Which l bet is more
than any god can do!

622
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:29,565
But the arrow.

623
01:08:31,009 --> 01:08:34,081
The arrow stuck in the bandolier.
No miracle.

624
01:08:34,289 --> 01:08:39,079
You better tell them. And my dad's
name was Herbert Dravot, Esquire...

625
01:08:39,329 --> 01:08:42,002
...and he was a bar steward in Durham!

626
01:08:42,249 --> 01:08:43,648
Hang on, Danny.

627
01:08:54,649 --> 01:08:57,641
-Maybe we're missing a bet.
-What do you mean?

628
01:08:57,849 --> 01:09:00,409
Supposing you was an ignorant Kafiri...

629
01:09:00,609 --> 01:09:03,760
...who would you rather follow,
a god or a man?

630
01:09:04,129 --> 01:09:07,758
Now, we're here to conquer
this country, ain't we?

631
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:13,083
Well, with you as a god, it would take
half the time and half the trouble.

632
01:09:13,289 --> 01:09:16,167
The idea is a bit blasphemous like.

633
01:09:16,369 --> 01:09:17,404
No, Danny...

634
01:09:17,649 --> 01:09:22,359
...blaspheming is when
you take his name in vain...

635
01:09:23,449 --> 01:09:25,360
...God Almighty's.

636
01:09:26,209 --> 01:09:29,281
What if they found out
we was having them on?

637
01:09:29,489 --> 01:09:31,081
Why should they?

638
01:09:31,329 --> 01:09:33,559
We won't tell them.

639
01:09:36,449 --> 01:09:41,239
-You won't tell them, will you, Billy?
-Oh, no. lndeed, by Jove, no.

640
01:09:47,569 --> 01:09:49,366
Polo.

641
01:09:50,169 --> 01:09:51,966
Polo.

642
01:10:14,209 --> 01:10:17,281
Er-Heb and Bashkai
celebrate new brotherhood.

643
01:10:17,489 --> 01:10:19,639
-With whose head?
-Ootah's.

644
01:10:31,569 --> 01:10:36,359
We marched and fought and took
more villages. Our ranks swelled.

645
01:10:36,569 --> 01:10:41,563
They were well trained, but with Danny
at their head, Sikander the Second...

646
01:10:41,769 --> 01:10:43,566
... they were also inspired.

647
01:11:58,569 --> 01:12:01,402
Sikander! Sikander!

648
01:12:04,169 --> 01:12:07,957
After half a dozen victories,
his fame was such...

649
01:12:08,169 --> 01:12:11,605
... that the fighting stopped.
We was met with gifts...

650
01:12:11,849 --> 01:12:16,047
...and bevies of maidens
who danced and threw flowers.

651
01:12:56,449 --> 01:12:57,962
Girl.

652
01:13:14,609 --> 01:13:17,487
Venus de Milo in the flesh,
if flesh it is...

653
01:13:17,689 --> 01:13:20,203
...and not Guinness and champagne.
Billy...

654
01:13:20,449 --> 01:13:23,361
...tell her to stand up
and turn around.

655
01:13:32,569 --> 01:13:34,958
Just gazing, Peachy. Just gazing.

656
01:13:36,769 --> 01:13:39,408
Just enjoying beauty for its own sake.

657
01:13:39,609 --> 01:13:43,602
Being only human,
one thing leads to another.

658
01:13:43,849 --> 01:13:48,400
Give her a hat with a feather, and
no girl in Brighton on bank holiday...

659
01:13:48,609 --> 01:13:50,565
...could hold a candle to her.

660
01:13:51,129 --> 01:13:52,881
l must admit...

661
01:13:53,129 --> 01:13:55,438
...she really is an eyef ul.

662
01:13:57,249 --> 01:13:59,365
What's your name, girl?

663
01:14:01,049 --> 01:14:03,085
-Roxanne.
-Roxanne.

664
01:14:03,329 --> 01:14:04,557
Here.

665
01:14:04,769 --> 01:14:08,478
Wasn't that the name of the princess
Alexander married?

666
01:14:08,689 --> 01:14:10,361
lt was that.

667
01:14:17,649 --> 01:14:19,765
Hold your head up.

668
01:14:28,929 --> 01:14:30,647
-Girl af raid.
-Of what?

669
01:14:31,249 --> 01:14:35,128
lf god takes a girl, she catches fire
and go up in smoke.

670
01:14:35,329 --> 01:14:38,765
-They do what?
-God's heart, a burning torch.

671
01:14:39,009 --> 01:14:44,686
His veins run fire, not blood.
lf god makes love to girl she goes:

672
01:14:45,049 --> 01:14:46,402
ln one flash.

673
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,048
Not even ashes left.

674
01:14:48,249 --> 01:14:51,002
l bet a jealous goddess made that up.

675
01:15:13,449 --> 01:15:15,599
They come from Sikandergul...

676
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:18,886
...with a message for son of Sikander.

677
01:15:19,809 --> 01:15:23,404
They're looking at him,
if they opened their eyes.

678
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:31,083
-The message's from Kaf u Selim.
-Who?

679
01:15:31,329 --> 01:15:34,241
Kaf u Selim, high priest of Kafiristan.

680
01:15:37,249 --> 01:15:39,444
What's the message?

681
01:15:41,649 --> 01:15:43,958
Kaf u Selim says come.

682
01:15:44,249 --> 01:15:46,160
Come?

683
01:15:46,569 --> 01:15:49,208
-ls that all?
-That's all, just come.

684
01:15:49,449 --> 01:15:51,804
Doesn't waste words, does he?

685
01:15:52,009 --> 01:15:56,480
Tell him we appreciate the invitation.
We'll avail ourselves of it...

686
01:15:56,689 --> 01:15:59,647
-...one of these days.
-No. Come means '' now.''

687
01:16:02,449 --> 01:16:04,963
What does he want to see us about?

688
01:16:05,209 --> 01:16:07,359
He just says come.

689
01:16:07,569 --> 01:16:09,002
l see.

690
01:16:09,249 --> 01:16:14,323
All right, tell him to stand by and
the army will be ready by first light.

691
01:16:20,449 --> 01:16:23,600
He says,
'' No! You come alone, him and you.''

692
01:16:23,849 --> 01:16:25,487
Without the army?

693
01:16:25,729 --> 01:16:31,167
Tell him Peachy and me don't go
anywhere without the army goes with us.

694
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:33,360
Shut up, Danny.

695
01:16:35,169 --> 01:16:36,761
We have to go.

696
01:16:36,969 --> 01:16:38,448
Have you gone starky?

697
01:16:38,649 --> 01:16:43,962
Keep your voice down and put a smile
on your face, we've got an audience.

698
01:16:44,209 --> 01:16:48,805
We'd be stone bonkers to walk into
a strange city by our lonesomes.

699
01:16:49,649 --> 01:16:53,039
Either we do what they say
or pull stumps and run.

700
01:16:53,249 --> 01:16:57,401
Make a beeline for the mountains
and never look back.

701
01:16:57,649 --> 01:17:00,766
Run? Not bloody likely.
Run from them?

702
01:17:01,009 --> 01:17:02,203
No...

703
01:17:02,449 --> 01:17:05,805
...from our blokes.
We're over a barrel, Danny.

704
01:17:06,049 --> 01:17:10,759
lf we back away from a meeting with
old Kaf u Selim, we'll lose face...

705
01:17:10,969 --> 01:17:14,962
...and that is the one thing
a god cannot afford.

706
01:17:15,609 --> 01:17:17,361
What to do?

707
01:17:17,809 --> 01:17:19,367
Bluff it out.

708
01:17:19,569 --> 01:17:23,960
Polish our buttons, stuff ramrods
up our jacksies and look bold.

709
01:17:24,169 --> 01:17:28,959
Like we did when we were on charges
for drunk and resisting the guard.

710
01:18:17,009 --> 01:18:20,285
-Sikandergul.
-God's holy trousers!

711
01:18:55,169 --> 01:18:58,161
No weapons allowed in Holy City.

712
01:20:19,129 --> 01:20:20,403
All right...

713
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,560
...you got us here.

714
01:20:23,049 --> 01:20:24,960
Now what?

715
01:20:30,609 --> 01:20:32,964
Where's your high panjandrum?

716
01:20:51,369 --> 01:20:54,805
Afternoon, Your Reverence.
You wanted to see me?

717
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:11,763
Tell him he can keep it.
l'm making him a present of it.

718
01:21:20,369 --> 01:21:23,679
-What did he say?
-He say, '' Now we shall see.''

719
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:31,963
You mortals wait down there.

720
01:21:57,049 --> 01:22:00,359
Tell them to take their
paws off me double quick...

721
01:22:00,569 --> 01:22:04,448
...or l'll have their guts for garters!
l'll pluck your livers...

722
01:22:04,649 --> 01:22:06,958
...and feed them to the kites!

723
01:22:07,209 --> 01:22:11,805
How dare you lay your hands on me,
Daniel Dravot, Esquire!

724
01:22:15,849 --> 01:22:18,158
Sikander!

725
01:22:48,729 --> 01:22:51,163
Now what the bleeding hell?

726
01:22:51,929 --> 01:22:54,727
One minute he's about to
cut my heart out...

727
01:22:54,929 --> 01:22:57,238
...next minute he's
flat on his face!

728
01:22:57,449 --> 01:22:59,405
He saw that...

729
01:23:00,129 --> 01:23:04,202
-...and dropped like he was poleax ed!
-What do you make of it?

730
01:23:05,049 --> 01:23:08,166
He says that is mark of Sikander.

731
01:23:38,849 --> 01:23:40,077
They're Masons!

732
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:45,120
By the square, level, plumb rule,
compasses, the all-seeing eye!

733
01:23:45,329 --> 01:23:46,762
The craft, Danny!

734
01:23:47,129 --> 01:23:50,041
-That's what saved us.
-Blimey.

735
01:23:53,969 --> 01:23:56,961
Only highest priest knows
about this sign...

736
01:23:57,169 --> 01:23:59,888
...put in stone long ago by Sikander.

737
01:24:00,049 --> 01:24:04,122
Now, Kaf u Selim rejoicing
at the coming of his son.

738
01:28:04,969 --> 01:28:07,358
lt ain't brass, Danny.

739
01:28:33,849 --> 01:28:38,365
-Sikander?
-Belonged to him, now son of Sikander's.

740
01:28:46,809 --> 01:28:48,322
These here...

741
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:53,483
...make jewels in the Tower of London
look like cheap family heirlooms.

742
01:29:03,049 --> 01:29:05,688
God's holy trousers!

743
01:29:12,089 --> 01:29:15,047
Look at the size of that ruby!

744
01:29:21,049 --> 01:29:23,609
There's a bigger one.

745
01:29:24,169 --> 01:29:25,761
Why, Danny...

746
01:29:25,929 --> 01:29:31,526
...we only have to fill our pockets and
walk out of here to be millionaires.

747
01:29:31,689 --> 01:29:35,602
And all of it, all...

748
01:29:35,769 --> 01:29:38,966
...would make us the
two richest men in England!

749
01:29:39,129 --> 01:29:41,723
-The empire.
-The world.

750
01:29:44,409 --> 01:29:47,082
But will they let us take it?

751
01:29:47,249 --> 01:29:49,717
Take it away, l mean.

752
01:29:52,369 --> 01:29:54,929
Ask him, Billy.

753
01:30:03,129 --> 01:30:07,600
He says, belong to son of Sikander.
Can do with it what he likes.

754
01:30:07,769 --> 01:30:10,408
Leave it here,
take away, no matter.

755
01:30:10,569 --> 01:30:13,037
His will be done.

756
01:30:13,809 --> 01:30:19,167
We've mules enough, and riflemen
to guard them when the time comes.

757
01:30:19,329 --> 01:30:21,206
What month is it?

758
01:30:21,369 --> 01:30:22,722
January, l make it...

759
01:30:22,889 --> 01:30:27,087
...or maybe February.
March, April, May, June...

760
01:30:27,249 --> 01:30:30,958
...four months of
winter monsoon, then....

761
01:30:31,129 --> 01:30:33,848
Four long months!

762
01:30:34,009 --> 01:30:36,318
What'll we do with the time?

763
01:30:36,489 --> 01:30:38,957
Add up our blessings here...

764
01:30:39,129 --> 01:30:41,165
...divide them by two...

765
01:30:41,329 --> 01:30:43,923
...not forgetting you, Billy.

766
01:30:44,889 --> 01:30:48,484
And multiply that by the
years we got left.

767
01:30:50,129 --> 01:30:51,801
Tell His Reverence...

768
01:30:51,969 --> 01:30:57,282
...he has my thanks for discharging
his trust so correctly...

769
01:30:57,449 --> 01:31:00,043
...and delivering to me what is mine.

770
01:31:02,649 --> 01:31:07,279
And tell him l'm also gratef ul
to all them other holy men...

771
01:31:07,449 --> 01:31:10,998
...who waited for me,
from one generation to another...

772
01:31:11,169 --> 01:31:16,482
...down the centuries to this
present day and fortuitous occasion.

773
01:31:26,689 --> 01:31:32,002
My lord, these people
are from village of Kamdesh.

774
01:31:32,169 --> 01:31:36,321
This man owns 60 cows.
All cows in the village.

775
01:31:36,649 --> 01:31:42,565
-Very enterprising of him.
-Enterprise is not his, it is hers.

776
01:31:42,729 --> 01:31:46,563
She's his wife. Every time
he catches her with other man...

777
01:31:46,729 --> 01:31:49,960
...other man has to pay
six cows. Kafiri custom.

778
01:31:50,249 --> 01:31:53,366
Use other man's wife,
pay him six cows.

779
01:31:53,529 --> 01:31:56,202
He's piled up
a fortune of 60 cows...

780
01:31:56,369 --> 01:31:59,441
-...out of her infidelities?
-And 32 goats.

781
01:32:01,209 --> 01:32:04,997
She ain't a wife.
She's a going concern!

782
01:32:06,369 --> 01:32:10,965
And these are the unfaithf ul
husbands and these the wives?

783
01:32:11,129 --> 01:32:15,998
Those four, wives of one man.
These three, wives of another.

784
01:32:17,809 --> 01:32:20,243
This ain't no laughing matter!

785
01:32:20,409 --> 01:32:24,607
No cattle, there ain't meat nor
hides. No milk, there ain't...

786
01:32:24,769 --> 01:32:28,284
...butter or cheese and the
children's bowls go empty.

787
01:32:28,449 --> 01:32:30,963
Outrageous, it is!

788
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:34,007
Now....

789
01:32:34,169 --> 01:32:38,003
For encouraging his wife to comport
herself like Jezebel...

790
01:32:38,169 --> 01:32:42,208
...one cow shall be paid
each of the other wives.

791
01:32:42,369 --> 01:32:45,486
For using a good law for
a bad purpose, another.

792
01:32:45,649 --> 01:32:49,119
For causing the young
to go without, a third.

793
01:32:49,729 --> 01:32:52,926
For thinking he can
get away with it, a fourth.

794
01:32:53,089 --> 01:32:58,402
He shall pay 22 cases of compensation
of four cows to each wife.

795
01:32:58,569 --> 01:33:01,402
Which means, she's got...

796
01:33:04,009 --> 01:33:07,763
-Fourteen and two-thirds.
-...more infidelities to commit...

797
01:33:07,929 --> 01:33:10,204
...to come out even.

798
01:33:10,369 --> 01:33:15,841
Let's see how he likes it when she
earns cows for others. Next case.

799
01:33:34,729 --> 01:33:36,959
-What's the charge?
-No charge.

800
01:33:37,129 --> 01:33:40,326
This chief from Agatsi which
village have fire...

801
01:33:40,489 --> 01:33:44,368
...and supply of grains go up in smoke.
He want permission...

802
01:33:44,529 --> 01:33:47,646
...to raid another village for
to steal grain.

803
01:33:47,809 --> 01:33:52,405
They don't have to raid and they won't
starve. Make a proclamation.

804
01:33:52,569 --> 01:33:55,800
-What number is it?
-Thirty-one, my lord.

805
01:33:55,969 --> 01:33:59,484
Each village will bring
one-tenth of its crop here...

806
01:33:59,649 --> 01:34:03,927
...to my royal city of Sikandergul
where same will be stored.

807
01:34:04,089 --> 01:34:07,764
Henceforth, any village
suffering from privation...

808
01:34:08,209 --> 01:34:11,884
...shall have grain issued
in accordance with its needs.

809
01:34:12,169 --> 01:34:15,241
l now pronounce this law enacted.
Selah.

810
01:34:15,409 --> 01:34:17,923
l pronounce a recess in this durbar.

811
01:34:18,089 --> 01:34:20,284
-Yes, my lord.
-Peachy.

812
01:34:25,209 --> 01:34:28,997
lf we're gonna make
it stick that l'm a god...

813
01:34:29,169 --> 01:34:34,004
...you ought to bow when you pass
in f ront of me like everybody else.

814
01:34:36,569 --> 01:34:38,685
-All right, Danny.
-Understand?

815
01:34:38,849 --> 01:34:42,080
-For appearances' sake.
-Yeah.

816
01:34:42,249 --> 01:34:47,039
-No offense?
-No, no, of course not, Danny.

817
01:34:54,849 --> 01:34:57,921
You have to take your
hat off to Daniel Dravot.

818
01:34:58,089 --> 01:35:01,479
He dealt out justice
as though he wrote the book.

819
01:35:02,689 --> 01:35:08,127
Peachy was general of his armies, but
there was no more battles to fight.

820
01:35:08,289 --> 01:35:13,522
Danny had him build a bridge that would
span the chasm below the Holy City.

821
01:35:13,689 --> 01:35:18,205
It'd help keep Peachy occupied
until the spring came.

822
01:35:37,449 --> 01:35:41,567
Look, Danny, the geese.
Skeins of them flying north.

823
01:35:41,729 --> 01:35:46,359
A fortnight and the pass will open.
What we ought to do is make camp...

824
01:35:46,529 --> 01:35:50,204
...high up on the mountain
and wait on the weather.

825
01:35:57,889 --> 01:36:01,245
-l ain't going, Peachy.
-What?

826
01:36:03,329 --> 01:36:06,560
-You heard me.
-Not going?

827
01:36:06,729 --> 01:36:08,401
Correct.

828
01:36:08,569 --> 01:36:11,242
Have you gone barmy?

829
01:36:11,729 --> 01:36:15,483
No, l ain't been drinking neither.

830
01:36:17,289 --> 01:36:19,757
l see things clear.

831
01:36:20,609 --> 01:36:23,965
lt's like bandages have been
removed from my eyes.

832
01:36:26,929 --> 01:36:30,239
Have you ever walked
into a strange room...

833
01:36:30,849 --> 01:36:33,966
...and it's like
you've been there before?

834
01:36:34,809 --> 01:36:37,801
-l know what you mean.
-Let me tell you something.

835
01:36:37,969 --> 01:36:41,598
This isn't the first time
l've worn a crown.

836
01:36:42,689 --> 01:36:45,726
There's more to this
than meets the eye.

837
01:36:45,889 --> 01:36:47,925
lt all adds up.

838
01:36:48,089 --> 01:36:49,886
What does?

839
01:36:50,049 --> 01:36:55,203
Everything that's happened from the
time we decided to come here.

840
01:36:55,369 --> 01:36:57,678
No, before that...

841
01:36:57,849 --> 01:37:01,637
...beginning with your taking
Brother Kipling's watch.

842
01:37:02,489 --> 01:37:07,643
More than chance has been
at work here. More than mere chance.

843
01:37:07,809 --> 01:37:10,528
Why his watch and not somebody else's?

844
01:37:10,689 --> 01:37:13,487
And what made him give me the emblem?

845
01:37:13,649 --> 01:37:15,879
One thing after the other.

846
01:37:16,049 --> 01:37:19,086
The avalanche, the arrow...

847
01:37:19,249 --> 01:37:21,240
...the mark on the stone...

848
01:37:21,409 --> 01:37:26,563
-...not to mention another Roxanne.
-Roxanne? The Venus de Milo?

849
01:37:26,729 --> 01:37:28,685
The same.

850
01:37:28,849 --> 01:37:33,604
One more thing is needf ul
for my destiny to be f ulfilled.

851
01:37:33,769 --> 01:37:37,000
-l take her to wife.
-Leave the women alone.

852
01:37:37,169 --> 01:37:39,478
Who's talking women?
l said wife.

853
01:37:39,889 --> 01:37:43,404
-A queen to breed a king's son.
-And the contract?

854
01:37:43,569 --> 01:37:48,359
The contract lasted until we was
kings, and king l've been for months!

855
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:54,047
The first king since Alexander, the
first to wear his crown in 2200 and...

856
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:57,042
-14.
-...14 years!

857
01:37:57,209 --> 01:37:59,279
Him...

858
01:37:59,449 --> 01:38:01,644
...and now me!

859
01:38:03,689 --> 01:38:06,408
They call me his son and l am...

860
01:38:06,569 --> 01:38:09,322
...in spirit anyway.

861
01:38:09,489 --> 01:38:12,367
lt's a hugeous responsibility.

862
01:38:12,529 --> 01:38:17,000
The bridge is the first of many.
They'll tie the country together.

863
01:38:17,169 --> 01:38:21,128
A nation l shall make of it
with an anthem and a flag.

864
01:38:21,289 --> 01:38:25,521
l shall treat on equal terms the viceroy
and other kings and princes.

865
01:38:25,689 --> 01:38:30,638
When l've accomplished what l set out
to do, l'll stand before the queen...

866
01:38:30,809 --> 01:38:35,963
...not kneel, mind you, but stand
like an equal and she'll say:

867
01:38:36,129 --> 01:38:42,398
'' Please accept the Order of the Garter
as a mark of my esteem, cousin.''

868
01:38:42,569 --> 01:38:48,041
She'll pin it on me herself.
lt's big. l tell you, it's big!

869
01:38:48,209 --> 01:38:51,679
And l tell you, you need a physic!

870
01:38:52,249 --> 01:38:54,205
l'm fair disappointed in you.

871
01:38:54,369 --> 01:38:57,805
You, who followed me and
helped make me what l am.

872
01:38:57,969 --> 01:39:02,645
Followed you, me? Who had hold
of the mule's tail, tell me that?

873
01:39:02,809 --> 01:39:05,198
The jenny also done her bit.

874
01:39:05,369 --> 01:39:10,318
Danny! We've had this rare streak
of luck. Let's quit winners for once.

875
01:39:10,489 --> 01:39:15,847
-Cut and run while the running's good.
-You call it luck. l call it destiny.

876
01:39:16,009 --> 01:39:21,129
Ha, ha! Pardon me
while l fall down laughing.

877
01:39:22,129 --> 01:39:26,645
Whatever you may think and however you
may feel, l'm a king and you're a subject!

878
01:39:26,849 --> 01:39:30,046
So don't you provoke me,
Peachy Carnehan!

879
01:39:30,209 --> 01:39:31,642
Or you'll do what?

880
01:39:31,809 --> 01:39:35,688
You've got me trembling
in my boots here! What'll you do?

881
01:39:38,889 --> 01:39:43,485
-You have permission to bugger off!
-l will, with or without your...

882
01:39:43,649 --> 01:39:46,243
...bleeding permission!

883
01:39:48,089 --> 01:39:51,843
And may you rot in hell, Daniel Dravot!

884
01:39:52,569 --> 01:39:57,802
From Sikander the First to the Second
was a long time between kings...

885
01:39:57,969 --> 01:40:01,598
...and a country needs a king
like a king needs a crown.

886
01:40:01,769 --> 01:40:04,363
One is the glory of the other.

887
01:40:04,529 --> 01:40:10,081
Therefore, l shall leave a son behind
who will in turn beget other sons...

888
01:40:10,249 --> 01:40:16,484
...so the succession will be unbroken
and kings will be guaranteed forever.

889
01:40:17,049 --> 01:40:19,119
To which end...

890
01:40:19,289 --> 01:40:21,803
...l have chosen a wife.

891
01:40:22,129 --> 01:40:24,768
Roxanne of Khawak.

892
01:40:43,929 --> 01:40:47,365
Let her be brought here
attended by her family.

893
01:40:47,529 --> 01:40:50,805
l want flowers strewed
along her way.

894
01:40:50,969 --> 01:40:55,281
The wedding ceremony will be
surrounded by pomp and circumstance!

895
01:40:55,449 --> 01:41:01,126
Let messengers be sent forth and
summon my people from near and far.

896
01:41:01,569 --> 01:41:03,799
Selah.

897
01:41:21,609 --> 01:41:23,327
What are they saying?

898
01:41:23,489 --> 01:41:26,925
How can daughters
of men marry gods or devils?

899
01:41:27,409 --> 01:41:30,446
-A god can do anything.
-But it is not proper.

900
01:41:30,609 --> 01:41:34,204
-Who says it isn't?
-All the priests.

901
01:41:37,409 --> 01:41:40,924
Would they put their word
against that of a god?

902
01:41:44,409 --> 01:41:46,764
They say let lmbra decide.

903
01:41:47,649 --> 01:41:49,799
lmbra is highest god of all.

904
01:41:50,649 --> 01:41:54,085
And what if lmbra should
hold against me?

905
01:41:54,249 --> 01:41:56,524
What'll they do about it?

906
01:41:57,409 --> 01:41:59,365
Am l a dog or a god?

907
01:41:59,529 --> 01:42:03,488
Haven't l put the shadow of my hand
over this country?

908
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:07,803
Do as l say! Send for the girl!

909
01:42:07,969 --> 01:42:10,608
Tell them that's an order!

910
01:42:32,769 --> 01:42:37,126
-Well, Billy, what's going on?
-Signs very bad, Peachy.

911
01:42:37,289 --> 01:42:42,283
Priests open up birds, green inside and
stinking horrid. lmbra very angry.

912
01:42:42,449 --> 01:42:47,000
They probably cut the spleen.
The green's only bile.

913
01:42:47,169 --> 01:42:52,687
Don't worry, Billy, the girl won't go
up in smoke. l'll guarantee you that.

914
01:42:52,849 --> 01:42:56,444
Girl don't matter.
Many girls here, no difference.

915
01:42:56,609 --> 01:42:58,520
Few girls more or less...

916
01:42:58,689 --> 01:43:04,719
...but cows now, they dry up
and goats throw babies too soon.

917
01:43:04,889 --> 01:43:07,244
And corn do not ripen.

918
01:43:07,409 --> 01:43:08,808
Everybody go hungry.

919
01:43:08,969 --> 01:43:15,408
Now, Billy, you know as well as l do
that Dravot's no god.

920
01:43:15,569 --> 01:43:17,605
He told you about the arrow.

921
01:43:17,769 --> 01:43:21,318
But then, priests must
be mistaken about lmbra.

922
01:43:21,489 --> 01:43:23,878
He not angry because...

923
01:43:24,049 --> 01:43:27,837
...god marrying a mortal
but because son of man...

924
01:43:28,009 --> 01:43:30,967
...pretend to be a god.

925
01:45:07,289 --> 01:45:09,849
Roxanne, don't be af raid...

926
01:45:10,089 --> 01:45:12,000
...l wouldn't harm you.

927
01:45:12,889 --> 01:45:17,041
When the time comes,
you'll catch fire, l warrant.

928
01:45:17,289 --> 01:45:20,520
All women should when
their husbands hold them.

929
01:45:20,689 --> 01:45:24,443
But you won't perish, girl,
l promise you that.

930
01:46:47,289 --> 01:46:48,961
Well, Danny...

931
01:46:49,169 --> 01:46:52,400
...the time has come,
as the saying goes.

932
01:46:52,649 --> 01:46:54,002
When do you leave?

933
01:46:54,249 --> 01:46:56,205
At first light.

934
01:46:56,369 --> 01:47:00,920
l thought you might look in the
box es before l nail them shut.

935
01:47:01,089 --> 01:47:04,161
-See what l'm taking.
-Take what you like.

936
01:47:04,329 --> 01:47:09,005
l weighed the gold out, pound for
pound. The gems, ounce for ounce.

937
01:47:09,169 --> 01:47:10,204
Right.

938
01:47:12,249 --> 01:47:15,047
l'll only need half the
mules we planned.

939
01:47:15,289 --> 01:47:19,840
l'd like to take 20 riflemen
to be safe through the Khyber Pass.

940
01:47:20,089 --> 01:47:23,001
Take them.
Take them.

941
01:47:29,649 --> 01:47:32,004
God's holy trousers!

942
01:47:35,889 --> 01:47:38,005
What is that?

943
01:47:42,689 --> 01:47:44,998
They're savages here, one and all.

944
01:47:45,209 --> 01:47:49,760
Leave them to slaughtering babies,
playing stick-and-ball with heads...

945
01:47:49,929 --> 01:47:52,204
...and pissing on their neighbours.

946
01:47:55,809 --> 01:47:57,401
Please, Danny...

947
01:47:59,089 --> 01:48:02,399
...for the last time of asking...

948
01:48:02,609 --> 01:48:04,406
...come back with me.

949
01:48:05,129 --> 01:48:07,802
For the last time of answering,
l won't.

950
01:48:08,689 --> 01:48:12,284
l know you've got my best
interest at heart...

951
01:48:12,449 --> 01:48:14,724
...but the choice has been made.

952
01:48:14,969 --> 01:48:18,200
Well, l'll be seeing you, then?

953
01:48:18,569 --> 01:48:21,003
ln London maybe...

954
01:48:22,929 --> 01:48:26,478
...when the queen gives you
the Order of the Garter.

955
01:48:35,409 --> 01:48:37,525
-Peachy.
-Yes, Danny?

956
01:48:37,689 --> 01:48:39,566
l'll be married midmorning.

957
01:48:39,889 --> 01:48:42,801
Could you not wait
and leave afterwards?

958
01:48:42,969 --> 01:48:45,802
See me up the aisle
for old times' sake?

959
01:48:47,449 --> 01:48:49,201
lf you like.

960
01:50:56,049 --> 01:50:58,005
Peachy, the ring.

961
01:51:02,689 --> 01:51:05,840
l, Sikander the Second,
hereby take thee...

962
01:51:06,009 --> 01:51:08,887
...Roxanne, to be
my lawf ul wedded wife...

963
01:51:09,489 --> 01:51:14,199
...and queen of Kafiristan.
Selah.

964
01:51:31,489 --> 01:51:33,400
She bit me!

965
01:51:36,569 --> 01:51:38,685
The slut bit me!

966
01:52:03,409 --> 01:52:04,808
What's he saying?

967
01:52:05,009 --> 01:52:09,844
Danny's bleeding, they know!
He says, '' Not god, not devil, but man!''

968
01:52:10,009 --> 01:52:12,762
They've twigged it, Danny.
You've had it!

969
01:52:16,409 --> 01:52:17,444
The jig's up!

970
01:52:17,609 --> 01:52:20,203
-l, Sikander--
-For God's sake!

971
01:52:23,449 --> 01:52:28,204
We've got to brass it out, Danny.
Danny, brass it out!

972
01:52:35,449 --> 01:52:37,599
Bags of swank.

973
01:53:13,369 --> 01:53:17,647
We'll get your riflemen and
come back and slaughter the dogs!

974
01:53:26,889 --> 01:53:31,041
A drenching in their own blood
we'll give them! Prepare to advance!

975
01:53:31,209 --> 01:53:34,201
Too many for that, Danny.
Retire in sections.

976
01:53:34,369 --> 01:53:36,439
Retire? Retire be damned!

977
01:53:36,689 --> 01:53:38,805
We've gotta make a run for it!

978
01:53:41,889 --> 01:53:43,607
Front section...

979
01:53:44,409 --> 01:53:45,808
...fire!

980
01:53:47,289 --> 01:53:48,802
Back!

981
01:53:50,209 --> 01:53:52,598
Front rank, fire!

982
01:53:55,009 --> 01:53:56,408
Break ranks!

983
01:55:40,849 --> 01:55:44,728
Mount the mule and ride!
There's a chance you'll make it.

984
01:55:44,889 --> 01:55:47,119
Gurkha foot soldier, not cavalry.

985
01:55:47,369 --> 01:55:51,999
Rifleman Machendra Bahadur Gurung
wishing you many good lucks.

986
01:56:19,769 --> 01:56:21,248
Out of bloody ammo!

987
01:56:21,489 --> 01:56:22,808
Me too!

988
01:56:42,889 --> 01:56:46,040
l'm heartily ashamed
for getting you killed...

989
01:56:46,209 --> 01:56:48,769
...instead of going home rich...

990
01:56:48,929 --> 01:56:53,320
...on account of me being so
bleeding high and bloody mighty!

991
01:56:53,569 --> 01:56:55,605
Can you forgive me?

992
01:56:57,489 --> 01:57:01,448
That l can, and that l do, Danny.

993
01:57:01,649 --> 01:57:05,801
Free and f ull and
without let or hindrance.

994
01:57:05,969 --> 01:57:07,925
Everything's all right, then.

995
01:58:13,489 --> 01:58:15,798
Cut, you buggers, cut!

996
01:59:03,849 --> 01:59:08,843
And old Danny fell round
and round and round and round...

997
01:59:09,089 --> 01:59:13,446
...like a penny whirligig.
Twenty thousand miles!

998
01:59:13,689 --> 01:59:19,446
lt took him half an hour to fall
before he struck the rocks.

999
01:59:19,689 --> 01:59:23,398
And do you know what
they did to Peachy?

1000
01:59:24,969 --> 01:59:27,403
They crucified him, sir...

1001
01:59:28,249 --> 01:59:30,809
...between two pine trees...

1002
01:59:31,289 --> 01:59:35,168
...as Peachy's hands will show.

1003
01:59:37,689 --> 01:59:40,806
Poor Peachy, who'd never
done them any harm.

1004
01:59:41,049 --> 01:59:45,247
He just hung there and he screamed,
but he didn't die.

1005
01:59:45,409 --> 01:59:48,242
The next day they came
and took him down...

1006
01:59:48,409 --> 01:59:52,846
...and said it's a miracle he wasn't
dead and they let him go.

1007
01:59:54,489 --> 01:59:58,641
And Peachy come home
in about a year...

1008
01:59:58,889 --> 02:00:02,802
...and the mountains they tried
to fall on old Peachy...

1009
02:00:03,049 --> 02:00:08,521
...but he was quite safe
because Daniel walked before him.

1010
02:00:10,089 --> 02:00:16,198
And Daniel never let go
of Peachy's hand.

1011
02:00:17,569 --> 02:00:21,847
And Peachy never let go
of Daniel's head.

1012
02:00:23,809 --> 02:00:25,367
His head?

02:00:25,609 --> 02:00:27,406

1019
02:00:47,289 --> 02:00:50,838
