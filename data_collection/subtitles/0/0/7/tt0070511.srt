1
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:37,280
All present and accounted for, sir.

2
00:00:37,363 --> 00:00:38,948
Thank you, Captain.

3
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:48,416
As of this moment...

4
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:53,963
...you are the property of
the Penal Administration of French Guiana.

5
00:00:55,548 --> 00:00:58,509
After serving your full terms in prison...

6
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:01,846
...those of you with sentences...

7
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:04,641
...of eight years or more...

8
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:07,352
...will remain in Guiana...

9
00:01:07,685 --> 00:01:09,896
...as workers and colonists...

10
00:01:10,396 --> 00:01:14,275
...for a period equal
to that of your original sentences.

11
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,028
As for France...

12
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:19,614
...the nation has disposed of you.

13
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:24,202
France has rid herself of you altogether.

14
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:29,040
Forget France and put your clothes on.

15
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:26,574
Papillon! Papi!

16
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:30,787
You'll be back, Papillon.

17
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:32,789
Don't worry, you'll be back.

18
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:40,713
No, you won't.

19
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:54,936
You, that way.

20
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,480
Down there. You, too.

21
00:03:58,314 --> 00:04:00,191
Next, over here. Come along.

22
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:02,694
Come on. Come in here.

23
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,570
You, too.

24
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:05,905
Over there.

25
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,575
Come along, up there. Hurry up.

26
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:14,998
You, too. Down.

27
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:16,874
Down. In there.

28
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,459
In there.

29
00:04:19,711 --> 00:04:21,379
Come along, now. Down.

30
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:24,132
Come on down. Down there.

31
00:04:30,388 --> 00:04:31,806
Come on, up there.

32
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:33,891
In there.

33
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:21,165
We're really something, aren't we?

34
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:24,961
The only animals in the world
that shove things up their ass for survival.

35
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,797
The first time I shoved one up my gut...

36
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,134
...it infected me so bad
the camp doctor had to cut it out.

37
00:06:32,135 --> 00:06:33,678
He doesn't have any ether...

38
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,222
...so he knocks me out with rum.

39
00:06:37,557 --> 00:06:38,808
Then you know what he did?

40
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:40,018
He stole it.

41
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,565
A butterfly.

42
00:06:46,524 --> 00:06:48,067
You're Papillon, aren't you?

43
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:49,569
Yeah.

44
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:51,779
The bastards gave you life.

45
00:06:53,197 --> 00:06:55,867
Right to the end of the line, they think.

46
00:06:55,992 --> 00:06:58,119
It may not be as long as you think.

47
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:00,038
Forty percent of us will die...

48
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:01,789
...the first year out.

49
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:07,962
They gave him life, too.

50
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:10,048
The kid's only 18.

51
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,675
Look at him. No wonder he dreams.

52
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:15,887
He'll never make it.

53
00:07:19,932 --> 00:07:21,851
But a man like you could make it...

54
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:23,853
...if you have enough money.

55
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,897
How long were you there?

56
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:28,691
Nine years of work camp...

57
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:31,402
...nine years a colonist.

58
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:34,280
You were outside the walls.
Why didn't you run?

59
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:36,657
There's no place to run to.

60
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:39,994
You're out in the middle of a swamp,
1,000 miles from no place.

61
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:42,914
Now, if you've got a lot of money
that's a different thing.

62
00:07:43,122 --> 00:07:46,292
I mean, you take somebody
like Dega there. Back there.

63
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:51,422
Louis Dega.
The best counterfeiter in France.

64
00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:53,758
National Defense Bonds.

65
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,010
-Series of 1928.
-Right.

66
00:07:57,595 --> 00:08:01,432
Now, if you've got money like he has,
there's a chance to buy your way out.

67
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:07,063
That is unless somebody cuts
his guts open first to get at all that cash.

68
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:10,942
Everybody up! Let's go!

69
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,235
Everybody up!

70
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:14,612
Come on, everybody up! Let's go!

71
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:15,697
Let's go!

72
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,978
Mind if I sit down here?

73
00:08:49,188 --> 00:08:50,273
If you wish.

74
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,904
You're Dega, aren't ya? Louis Dega?

75
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,077
Sorry to see you here.

76
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:05,621
I presume most of us have earned
our passage.

77
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:11,627
You're Papillon. You got life for killing
a pimp. Then you had the bad taste...

78
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:14,714
...to tell the prosecutor you were going
to escape and kill him, too.

79
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:16,507
I was framed. I'm innocent.

80
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:18,176
No one is innocent.

81
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,219
I'm no pimp killer, for Christ's sake.

82
00:09:20,553 --> 00:09:21,679
I'm a safecracker.

83
00:09:22,388 --> 00:09:25,433
And that's a profession of which
I thoroughly disapprove.

84
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:29,520
I put almost everything I had
into National Defense Bonds.

85
00:09:31,064 --> 00:09:32,899
Series of 1928.

86
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:34,859
1928?

87
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:39,614
Your instincts were sound.
How much did you lose?

88
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:42,992
I wouldn't put my money on those bonds.
Not any more than you would.

89
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:44,786
I'm relieved to hear that.

90
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:47,205
If that's true,
why are we having this little chat?

91
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:52,543
Every convict on this ship knows
who you are.

92
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:57,215
Any of them would slit you open to
reach inside and get what you're carrying.

93
00:09:58,216 --> 00:09:59,175
So?

94
00:10:00,593 --> 00:10:01,761
You need protection.

95
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:03,971
From you?

96
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:10,853
Remember what the chicken said
to the weasel?

97
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:15,942
If he was a healthy weasel, the chicken
didn't get a chance to say anything.

98
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:17,902
Think about that.

99
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:41,384
Hose down!

100
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:43,761
Come on, off your asses! Hose down!

101
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:52,228
Come on, you've got a fever.

102
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:53,604
Do what I tell ya.

103
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:56,190
Come on.

104
00:10:56,482 --> 00:10:57,483
Julot!

105
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:01,988
I've got a question.

106
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:06,534
If I wanted to get a boat when I got there,
a small boat, maybe a 15-footer...

107
00:11:06,617 --> 00:11:07,577
...how much would it cost?

108
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,122
I don't know. Fr 3,500, Fr 4,500, maybe.
It all depends.

109
00:11:11,164 --> 00:11:13,499
What if I could pick up the money
to buy one?

110
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,418
Then I guess you'd have yourself a boat.

111
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:18,629
You know the country.
You and I could make it out of there. Huh?

112
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:22,300
The answer is no. Nothing against you,
but the answer is no.

113
00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:26,179
If I've gotta go to solitary for
some half-assed escape that didn't work...

114
00:11:26,262 --> 00:11:29,640
...l want the mistake to be mine,
not anybody else's. You understand?

115
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:31,267
So the answer is no.

116
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:33,311
How'd it feel, kid?

117
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,520
Good.

118
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,562
All right. Come on, move it!

119
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:05,570
Move it a little. Let's go!

120
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:10,992
Let's move!

121
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,099
What do you want?

122
00:13:35,183 --> 00:13:36,893
Almost unbearable, isn't it?

123
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:39,604
What?

124
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:41,230
The heat.

125
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:42,899
It's not too bad.

126
00:13:43,816 --> 00:13:45,902
Of course, you're closer to it than I am.

127
00:13:46,194 --> 00:13:49,989
Oh, yes. You're referring to last night,
aren't you?

128
00:13:51,407 --> 00:13:52,658
Well, aren't you?

129
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,661
May I tell you something?

130
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:58,206
At first glance I'm afraid
that I regarded you with rather...

131
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:01,501
...a large degree of unworthy suspicion.

132
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:03,169
Am I clear?

133
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:04,337
No.

134
00:14:04,462 --> 00:14:09,050
Well, it now seems quite possible
that until we get to a decent jail...

135
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:13,054
...with bribeable guards,
I may stand in some need of...

136
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,849
...rather close physical protection.

137
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:20,436
It depends on how long you want to live.

138
00:14:20,645 --> 00:14:21,813
Oh, a long time.

139
00:14:24,232 --> 00:14:25,900
Then you got a problem.

140
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:28,945
Well, I presume that you have some...

141
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:31,823
...goals, some particular need that...

142
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:33,825
...outweighs all others.

143
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:37,870
I mean, if so, may I ask what it is?

144
00:14:38,246 --> 00:14:39,247
Money.

145
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:40,581
For what?

146
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:41,916
Escape.

147
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:43,876
Very good.

148
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:46,546
You keep me alive...

149
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:51,259
...until we land in Guiana and I will
underwrite any escape you care to arrange.

150
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:54,554
Escape for me. Not for us.

151
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:56,514
Of course.

152
00:14:58,015 --> 00:15:01,686
I have no intention of even attempting
an escape. Ever.

153
00:15:05,023 --> 00:15:05,982
Done.

154
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:09,902
Thank you.

155
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:22,016
Leave him alone...

156
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,810
...or I'll cut your head off!

157
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:27,397
Hide this!

158
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:56,676
Over there is Saint Joseph.

159
00:16:57,969 --> 00:16:59,762
The other island is Royale.

160
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:01,806
The one on the right is Devil's.

161
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:05,727
Julot, why is it so hard
to escape from there?

162
00:17:07,145 --> 00:17:09,021
A man could almost swim to the mainland.

163
00:17:09,105 --> 00:17:11,482
No, there must be a better way
than swimming.

164
00:17:11,524 --> 00:17:13,192
No, no, swimming's not the way.

165
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:16,988
The current is so strong it'll push you
right back where you started from.

166
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:20,783
You know, when you're on those islands
you're there for keeps.

167
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:26,539
Where do we go?

168
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,585
We go up the Moroni River.

169
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:32,962
Then we dock at Saint Laurent.

170
00:17:33,046 --> 00:17:36,299
That's where they decide whether
to send you to the work camps or...

171
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,467
...to the islands.

172
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:18,883
You see those two on the dock
with the guns?

173
00:18:19,258 --> 00:18:20,426
Right over there.

174
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:25,723
They served their time.
Now they're colonists.

175
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:28,393
They've turned man hunter.

176
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:29,560
Man hunter?

177
00:18:30,228 --> 00:18:32,063
Yeah, you escape, they hunt.

178
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:34,440
For money, I presume, a reward.

179
00:18:35,024 --> 00:18:36,025
Jesus!

180
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:37,401
Get ready to move!

181
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:39,195
Line up to disembark.

182
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:04,262
I'm going to have an accident going down
that gangplank and it's gotta look good...

183
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:05,638
...so lend me your shiv.

184
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:07,140
What the hell for?

185
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:08,766
Because I'm a two-time loser.

186
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,103
No matter what happens, I'll be sent
to the islands on the next transport.

187
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:14,230
I have to get in the hospital
to give me time to think.

188
00:19:14,272 --> 00:19:15,857
Now give me that shiv!

189
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,183
You're crazy, Julot.

190
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:52,769
Single file down the gangplank. March.

191
00:20:07,492 --> 00:20:08,785
Hold it! Hold it!

192
00:20:30,682 --> 00:20:31,682
Let's go!

193
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,102
Single file!

194
00:20:39,482 --> 00:20:40,858
Move! Let's go!

195
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:43,820
Bring a stretcher.

196
00:20:46,656 --> 00:20:48,116
Single file, single file.

197
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:54,163
Take him away!

198
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,582
-All right, move! Move!
-Let's go!

199
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,458
Move it!

200
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,565
Come on, move 'em!

201
00:21:20,648 --> 00:21:22,608
Let's go! Come on!

202
00:21:57,477 --> 00:21:58,770
Column, march!

203
00:22:38,518 --> 00:22:39,811
Keep moving.

204
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:20,101
You two, pick him up, quickly!

205
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:31,464
Attention!

206
00:24:40,515 --> 00:24:42,266
Welcome to the Penal Colony...

207
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:44,560
...of French Guiana...

208
00:24:45,311 --> 00:24:47,021
...whose prisoners you are...

209
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,941
...and from which there is no escape.

210
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:52,902
First attempts at escape...

211
00:24:53,444 --> 00:24:56,531
...add two years in solitary
to existing sentences.

212
00:24:57,824 --> 00:24:59,826
Second attempts, add five more.

213
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:02,995
Of course, more serious offenses...

214
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,958
...are dealt with in this fashion.

215
00:25:15,842 --> 00:25:20,680
Make the best of what we offer you
and you will suffer less than you deserve.

216
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:22,932
Dismissed.

217
00:25:28,271 --> 00:25:29,564
In the bunkhouse.

218
00:25:29,647 --> 00:25:32,316
One, two, three, four.

219
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:35,153
Go on! Go on! Get a move on!

220
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,828
Mr. Dega?

221
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:47,624
Yes, indeed.
I know all about you, Mr. Dega.

222
00:25:48,207 --> 00:25:49,459
Very intelligent man.

223
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,378
Thank you. I seem to be known
in all the wrong places.

224
00:25:53,129 --> 00:25:56,382
Well, I have a friend who is a guard.
For very--

225
00:25:58,009 --> 00:25:58,968
Yes, go ahead.

226
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:03,514
For very little money he can arrange
for certain people to stay here...

227
00:26:04,057 --> 00:26:07,477
...instead of being sent to a work camp
or one of the islands.

228
00:26:08,227 --> 00:26:11,189
Can he get us a job here
so we can walk around the place?

229
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:14,025
Perhaps a selection from which
we may choose?

230
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:16,360
Oh, yes. That is, my friend can.

231
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:19,822
You take our money,
and you put your life on the line.

232
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,949
Of course.

233
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:23,993
How much will it cost?

234
00:26:24,202 --> 00:26:28,998
Well, my friend has a very large family.
Many little children, you understand?

235
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:32,001
And his sergeant has a mother,
heart trouble.

236
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:34,504
He was asking you how much,
not how many.

237
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:36,798
If you don't mind, I'll do the negotiating.

238
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:41,010
How much?

239
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:45,014
For you, Fr 500. For him, Fr 1,500.

240
00:26:46,516 --> 00:26:47,892
He made trouble.

241
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:52,438
Yes, indeed he did. Nevertheless,
I'll give you Fr 1,250 for the both of us.

242
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,983
Now, you take it or leave it as you wish.

243
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:15,086
Try again.

244
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:19,632
Very well. I want two pairs
of comfortable shoes for the both of us...

245
00:27:19,715 --> 00:27:21,592
...and you, you get the Fr 2,000.

246
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:25,096
Don't you have to go to the toilet?

247
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:27,724
Oh, yes, of course.
Would you excuse me a moment?

248
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:31,519
You don't need to, Mr. Dega.
Unless, of course, you want to.

249
00:27:32,437 --> 00:27:34,313
I can pick it up in the morning.

250
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:11,184
Get moving, white men!

251
00:28:12,351 --> 00:28:14,812
Let's go! Come on, move it!

252
00:28:14,896 --> 00:28:16,647
Let's go! Come on, move it!

253
00:28:16,689 --> 00:28:18,149
On your feet!

254
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:07,031
Attention! Present arms!

255
00:29:15,206 --> 00:29:16,666
No! No!

256
00:29:22,922 --> 00:29:23,965
No!

257
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:46,195
Mr. Dega, did you get the money?

258
00:29:52,618 --> 00:29:55,163
Move it! Move it! Move it!

259
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,750
Get going! Move it!

260
00:30:02,295 --> 00:30:03,963
Fischer, what the hell's wrong?

261
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:06,049
Someone broke out
of the hospital compound.

262
00:30:08,926 --> 00:30:11,262
All right, break it up. We'll get him.

263
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:13,973
Next.

264
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:20,480
Next.

265
00:30:28,655 --> 00:30:30,114
You're fine. Next.

266
00:30:30,198 --> 00:30:31,783
I must be better than I feel.

267
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:34,786
You're in wonderful shape.

268
00:30:36,537 --> 00:30:38,623
How do you fail an examination like this?

269
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:39,749
Next.

270
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:45,129
7551 .

271
00:30:49,008 --> 00:30:49,675
Dega?

272
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:51,594
Yes, sir, Louis Dega.

273
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,888
It was suggested that I speak to you, sir--

274
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:55,181
I have it right here.

275
00:30:55,264 --> 00:30:58,142
We'll just keep you on here
in the cleaning squad.

276
00:30:58,518 --> 00:31:00,561
Thank you, sir. There's also my friend.

277
00:31:00,645 --> 00:31:01,771
You're Louis Dega?

278
00:31:01,854 --> 00:31:04,482
I am, sir. And this is my friend, Papillon.

279
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:06,484
We have a great deal in common,
Mr. Dega.

280
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:08,194
I'm extremely glad to see you.

281
00:31:08,277 --> 00:31:11,155
Why, thank you, sir.
Of course, if the circumstances were--

282
00:31:11,197 --> 00:31:14,826
My family lost everything they had
in counterfeit National Defense Bonds.

283
00:31:18,871 --> 00:31:21,291
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that, sir.

284
00:31:21,582 --> 00:31:25,712
Even so, buying them was a tribute
to their patriotism, wouldn't you say?

285
00:31:27,171 --> 00:31:29,090
And you're Mr. Dega's friend?

286
00:31:29,507 --> 00:31:30,341
Well--

287
00:31:30,425 --> 00:31:32,677
There's one thing about Saint Laurent
you'll like:

288
00:31:32,718 --> 00:31:34,762
We never separate old friends.

289
00:31:35,722 --> 00:31:38,307
Kilo 40. Both of them. Today's transport.

290
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,817
What is Kilo 40?

291
00:32:09,422 --> 00:32:12,091
Don't touch him.
You'll wind up worse off than he is.

292
00:32:12,175 --> 00:32:13,843
Move! Get moving!

293
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:21,225
Duck!

294
00:32:24,771 --> 00:32:26,564
Get up, you lazy bastards!

295
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,150
You get that crock
and you bring him along!

296
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:31,861
You! Pick another man
and grab that crock.

297
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:45,124
Come on, move!

298
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:46,667
Move!

299
00:33:07,105 --> 00:33:09,315
The son of a bitch isn't dead,
they just irritated him!

300
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:11,776
Get his tail. You get his tail.

301
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:15,238
-Where's his tail?
-Over there.

302
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:20,410
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

303
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:21,953
-So am l.
-Go ahead.

304
00:33:22,036 --> 00:33:23,037
Okay.

305
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,126
Ready?

306
00:33:29,168 --> 00:33:30,878
-Is that the tail?
-No.

307
00:33:31,462 --> 00:33:33,339
I'd better go over to this side.

308
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:37,552
You get the head.

309
00:33:37,635 --> 00:33:38,803
-The head?
-Yeah.

310
00:33:39,846 --> 00:33:41,055
You try the tail.

311
00:33:43,975 --> 00:33:45,601
Okay, now you try the head.

312
00:33:48,813 --> 00:33:49,772
Grab him!

313
00:33:51,691 --> 00:33:52,775
He's dead.

314
00:33:53,276 --> 00:33:54,694
He's still talking.

315
00:33:57,613 --> 00:33:58,740
He's dead!

316
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:01,117
He's dead?

317
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:11,169
Move it!

318
00:34:18,885 --> 00:34:19,969
Come on.

319
00:34:21,387 --> 00:34:22,763
Come on, hands up.

320
00:34:23,222 --> 00:34:24,265
Next!

321
00:34:25,016 --> 00:34:25,850
Move!

322
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:29,187
Next!

323
00:34:29,896 --> 00:34:31,189
Bring it around here.

324
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:33,399
Just lay the crock right there.

325
00:34:33,524 --> 00:34:35,234
-Just drop it.
-Hold it.

326
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:37,653
Move out.

327
00:34:39,656 --> 00:34:41,032
He's pretty big.

328
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,825
This skin's worth some money.

329
00:34:51,876 --> 00:34:52,877
Move it!

330
00:34:53,002 --> 00:34:54,962
What the hell are you looking at?

331
00:35:16,442 --> 00:35:17,527
You're Louis Dega.

332
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,571
Yes, sir.

333
00:35:20,697 --> 00:35:21,948
I'm Clusiot.

334
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:24,867
How come you ended up
in a place like this?

335
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:27,370
Favoritism.

336
00:35:34,085 --> 00:35:35,920
Friend's kind of quiet, isn't he?

337
00:35:36,087 --> 00:35:37,171
He's dead.

338
00:35:38,506 --> 00:35:42,260
He jammed a piece of wood down
his throat and choked himself to death.

339
00:35:45,054 --> 00:35:46,514
Three-way split....

340
00:35:47,223 --> 00:35:48,683
It's fair, isn't it?

341
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:08,077
Quinine.

342
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:11,247
Worst country in the world for malaria.

343
00:36:20,256 --> 00:36:22,050
Here, take them.

344
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,595
Go ahead, I've got some left.

345
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:29,932
Well, if I'm going to get my sleep...

346
00:36:30,808 --> 00:36:33,394
...I'll have to take this poor bastard
with me.

347
00:36:38,191 --> 00:36:39,400
A decent man.

348
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:44,322
Dega....

349
00:36:46,365 --> 00:36:48,910
The man hunters.
The ones we saw down at the dock.

350
00:36:49,827 --> 00:36:50,953
Son of a bitches.

351
00:36:57,668 --> 00:36:59,921
-Butterflies?
-Yeah, that's right.

352
00:37:00,463 --> 00:37:01,923
Some guy named Richter.

353
00:37:02,006 --> 00:37:05,677
He works every camp on the river
buying the damn things.

354
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,972
We catch them, he buys them,
the guards get the big payoff.

355
00:37:10,515 --> 00:37:12,850
It's called the Blue Morphus butterfly.

356
00:37:13,184 --> 00:37:16,771
It's wings are used for dye
in making American currency.

357
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:20,900
How often does he come up here?

358
00:37:20,983 --> 00:37:22,360
A couple of times a month.

359
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:23,277
Boat?

360
00:37:23,361 --> 00:37:24,696
No other way.

361
00:37:25,697 --> 00:37:27,073
-Why?
-Thinking.

362
00:37:28,491 --> 00:37:31,202
I handle a boat pretty good myself,
you know?

363
00:37:31,911 --> 00:37:32,829
Yeah?

364
00:38:00,273 --> 00:38:02,984
You're supposed to catch them,
you clumsy bastard.

365
00:39:11,469 --> 00:39:14,305
-Where do you send these bugs, sir?
-The United States.

366
00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:22,730
How much would you charge
to send this one to Panama?

367
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:28,152
Guard, come here a minute.

368
00:39:29,654 --> 00:39:32,156
Don't turn me in, for Christ's sake.
I got Fr 1,000.

369
00:39:32,198 --> 00:39:33,282
I didn't hear you.

370
00:39:33,324 --> 00:39:35,326
I said I got Fr 2,000 on me.

371
00:39:35,576 --> 00:39:36,577
Right now.

372
00:39:36,661 --> 00:39:37,995
What's the trouble?

373
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:44,544
This man just brought me
the finest Morphus...

374
00:39:44,627 --> 00:39:45,753
...I've ever seen.

375
00:39:47,797 --> 00:39:49,340
Why don't you get him a net?

376
00:39:49,465 --> 00:39:50,675
Right away, sir.

377
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:53,469
I want a seaworthy boat, new sails.

378
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:57,849
It'll cost you Fr 4,000, my friend.
Half now, half on delivery.

379
00:39:58,182 --> 00:39:59,309
When will that be?

380
00:39:59,434 --> 00:40:00,727
One week from tonight.

381
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,145
Where will the boat be?

382
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,729
Half a mile down river.

383
00:40:04,397 --> 00:40:06,691
About 300 yards this side of the river...

384
00:40:06,774 --> 00:40:08,192
...there's a big tree.

385
00:40:08,234 --> 00:40:09,318
You can't miss it.

386
00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:11,029
I'll be there.

387
00:40:12,614 --> 00:40:14,449
You bring me the rest of the money.

388
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,909
I'll take you to your boat.

389
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:24,041
You're a goddamn burglar...

390
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:26,460
...and that proves it.

391
00:40:48,733 --> 00:40:49,901
Are you asleep?

392
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:52,528
No.

393
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:55,197
I've been thinking....

394
00:40:57,992 --> 00:40:59,702
When you decide to go...

395
00:41:01,954 --> 00:41:04,832
...I'd very much appreciate going with you.

396
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,254
What?

397
00:41:15,385 --> 00:41:16,928
-Can you handle a boat?
-No.

398
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,556
Well, can you even see a boat
without your glasses?

399
00:41:22,433 --> 00:41:23,476
I can help.

400
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:26,396
Jesus Christ! You're the one
that didn't want to risk it.

401
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,521
I didn't.

402
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,525
Now I have no choice.

403
00:41:31,776 --> 00:41:34,654
If I stay here in this place...

404
00:41:38,825 --> 00:41:39,867
...I'll die.

405
00:41:44,956 --> 00:41:46,290
Well, it's your money.

406
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,601
You two, I've got a job for you.

407
00:42:05,643 --> 00:42:08,855
You load a stiff into the boat,
you load him right now.

408
00:42:22,368 --> 00:42:23,411
Julot!

409
00:42:30,293 --> 00:42:31,294
Pick him up.

410
00:42:41,637 --> 00:42:42,513
Dega!

411
00:42:44,015 --> 00:42:45,266
Don't puke here!

412
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,518
Hey, Sarge!

413
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:49,187
Sarge!

414
00:42:50,354 --> 00:42:52,398
He didn't mean it, sir. He's sick.

415
00:42:52,481 --> 00:42:54,358
I'll take care of him.

416
00:42:56,444 --> 00:42:58,071
Stop that, you pig!

417
00:43:12,543 --> 00:43:14,212
You just leave him to me.

418
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:16,923
I'll take care of him, sir.

419
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:27,892
Stop, you bastard!

420
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:57,004
Do you realize that the first man
who carved a wheel out of stone...

421
00:43:58,172 --> 00:44:00,091
...used it as an ornament?

422
00:44:02,802 --> 00:44:05,263
I've always admired him for that.

423
00:44:09,475 --> 00:44:11,519
There's one search party that gave up.

424
00:44:18,609 --> 00:44:21,446
Instead of trying to make
the orifice fit the lens...

425
00:44:22,113 --> 00:44:24,490
...l made the lens fit the orifice.

426
00:44:31,038 --> 00:44:33,374
What do you think?
Did he make it or didn't he?

427
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:39,756
I'd say his chances are very poor,
wouldn't you?

428
00:44:40,006 --> 00:44:43,092
Jesus! Is that all you've got to say?

429
00:44:45,762 --> 00:44:47,722
What do you expect me to say?

430
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:51,142
That man risked his life to save mine.

431
00:44:54,187 --> 00:44:56,105
For me that's a new experience.

432
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,781
These may work better than I had hoped.

433
00:45:25,593 --> 00:45:27,512
I told you, you couldn't miss it.

434
00:45:31,557 --> 00:45:35,019
The only trouble is, you're a week early.

435
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,982
It's up to you.

436
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:42,652
You're worth just as much dead
as you are alive.

437
00:46:23,568 --> 00:46:25,570
The rule here is total silence.

438
00:46:26,863 --> 00:46:28,781
We make no pretense
of rehabilitation here.

439
00:46:28,864 --> 00:46:30,992
We're not priests, we're processors.

440
00:46:32,618 --> 00:46:35,705
A meatpacker processes live animals
into edible ones.

441
00:46:35,788 --> 00:46:38,499
We process dangerous men
into harmless ones.

442
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,961
This we accomplish by breaking you.

443
00:46:42,754 --> 00:46:46,174
Breaking you physically, spiritually,
and here.

444
00:46:47,592 --> 00:46:51,888
Strange things happen to the head here.
Put all hope out of your mind...

445
00:46:53,181 --> 00:46:56,100
...and masturbate as little as possible.
It drains the strength.

446
00:46:56,935 --> 00:46:58,478
That's all, take him away.

447
00:49:11,945 --> 00:49:13,196
One, two...

448
00:49:13,238 --> 00:49:15,489
...three, four, five.

449
00:49:19,452 --> 00:49:23,414
One, two, three, four, five.

450
00:50:49,709 --> 00:50:50,960
Oh, Jesus!

451
00:50:54,005 --> 00:50:57,592
No. You'll eat everything they give you.

452
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:10,188
I'm going to be fine.

453
00:51:12,899 --> 00:51:14,150
I'm going to be fine.

454
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:15,943
I'm going to be fine.

455
00:51:17,195 --> 00:51:19,864
One, two, three, four, five.

456
00:51:58,945 --> 00:52:00,530
I'm Jo-Jo.

457
00:52:01,614 --> 00:52:02,573
Papillon.

458
00:52:04,659 --> 00:52:05,910
How do I look?

459
00:52:06,327 --> 00:52:08,746
I feel pretty good...

460
00:52:09,122 --> 00:52:12,458
...but I need somebody
to tell me how I look.

461
00:52:14,377 --> 00:52:16,170
Fine. You look fine.

462
00:53:10,141 --> 00:53:11,851
"Chew the coconut well...

463
00:53:15,897 --> 00:53:17,482
"...then swallow the pulp.

464
00:53:17,565 --> 00:53:20,151
"One each day, for strength.

465
00:53:20,818 --> 00:53:22,278
"My thoughts are with you.

466
00:53:23,863 --> 00:53:24,906
"Squinter."

467
00:53:25,197 --> 00:53:29,035
Dega. I'll be a son of a bitch! Dega.

468
00:54:22,422 --> 00:54:24,382
I'm still here, you bastards!

469
00:55:36,704 --> 00:55:38,623
Prisoner, show yourself.

470
00:55:53,304 --> 00:55:55,264
You've been receiving coconuts.

471
00:55:56,349 --> 00:55:59,769
Unless you tell us who sent them,
your rations will be cut in half.

472
00:56:01,771 --> 00:56:03,314
Well, how can I tell you...

473
00:56:03,648 --> 00:56:05,525
...who sent me stuff I didn't get?

474
00:56:05,608 --> 00:56:06,734
What stuff?

475
00:56:08,569 --> 00:56:11,114
Well, I don't know.

476
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:13,324
You...

477
00:56:13,824 --> 00:56:15,368
...you said coconut.

478
00:56:16,118 --> 00:56:18,162
I want that name and I want it now.

479
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:26,045
Put him on half rations
and screen his cell for six months.

480
00:56:28,506 --> 00:56:30,842
Darkness does wonders for a bad memory.

481
00:57:22,477 --> 00:57:24,103
You know the charge.

482
00:57:25,229 --> 00:57:26,439
I'm innocent.

483
00:57:27,106 --> 00:57:28,816
I didn't kill that pimp.

484
00:57:29,275 --> 00:57:32,195
You couldn't get anything on me
and you framed me.

485
00:57:33,655 --> 00:57:35,281
That is quite true.

486
00:57:36,741 --> 00:57:41,079
But your real crime has nothing to do
with a pimp's death.

487
00:57:43,373 --> 00:57:44,248
Well then?

488
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,625
What is it?

489
00:57:45,917 --> 00:57:50,964
Yours is the most terrible crime
a human being can commit.

490
00:57:52,006 --> 00:57:53,466
I accuse you...

491
00:57:54,592 --> 00:57:56,427
...of a wasted life.

492
00:58:00,139 --> 00:58:01,182
Guilty.

493
00:58:02,642 --> 00:58:04,769
The penalty for that is death.

494
00:58:07,271 --> 00:58:08,314
Guilty.

495
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:12,568
Guilty.

496
00:58:17,532 --> 00:58:18,533
Guilty.

497
00:59:14,088 --> 00:59:15,131
They know.

498
00:59:40,156 --> 00:59:41,324
How did you hear?

499
00:59:42,033 --> 00:59:45,328
Trusty works on the launch
between here and Saint Joseph.

500
00:59:46,287 --> 00:59:47,955
That's all that he said?

501
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:52,501
Then it's only a matter of time.

502
00:59:53,211 --> 00:59:54,212
You think so?

503
00:59:54,295 --> 00:59:56,756
He's on half rations now.
He can't exist on that.

504
00:59:57,882 --> 01:00:01,344
Forced to choose between starvation
and telling, what would you do?

505
01:00:03,054 --> 01:00:05,765
We're not talking about me.
What would you do?

506
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:08,351
I'd tell. I'd have to.

507
01:00:09,769 --> 01:00:12,939
You get weak, you get delirious,
you lose control...

508
01:00:14,732 --> 01:00:15,942
...and you talk.

509
01:00:17,902 --> 01:00:19,529
Then you won't blame him, huh?

510
01:00:25,701 --> 01:00:28,162
Blame is for God and small children.

511
01:01:15,626 --> 01:01:17,962
Look at me! I eat bugs!

512
01:01:18,963 --> 01:01:22,634
I don't...l don't have enough sense
to get out of the rain.

513
01:02:25,697 --> 01:02:27,323
Prisoner, show yourself.

514
01:02:48,344 --> 01:02:51,222
Give me the name
and you're back on full rations.

515
01:02:52,431 --> 01:02:53,516
Just one name.

516
01:02:56,769 --> 01:02:58,938
Well, I don't get that hungry.

517
01:03:01,941 --> 01:03:04,652
You'll starve. You should see yourself.

518
01:03:05,737 --> 01:03:07,572
I was born skinny.

519
01:03:11,492 --> 01:03:12,660
Then you'll die.

520
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:02,126
One, two....

521
01:04:21,812 --> 01:04:22,939
I'm Papillon.

522
01:04:23,981 --> 01:04:24,941
Francisco.

523
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:27,402
How do I look?

524
01:04:28,653 --> 01:04:29,862
Do I look okay?

525
01:04:30,572 --> 01:04:31,614
You look swell.

526
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,034
That's 30 days more...

527
01:05:17,076 --> 01:05:18,286
...pimp killer!

528
01:05:18,786 --> 01:05:20,330
I want to see the warden.

529
01:05:21,164 --> 01:05:22,165
I want to talk to him.

530
01:05:22,206 --> 01:05:24,083
I have something I want to tell him.

531
01:06:03,915 --> 01:06:05,458
Who gave you the food?

532
01:06:14,759 --> 01:06:15,968
I....

533
01:06:18,095 --> 01:06:20,223
Jesus, Warden...

534
01:06:21,766 --> 01:06:23,267
...l had it.

535
01:06:25,436 --> 01:06:27,897
I had the name, honest to God....

536
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:31,692
I must be light--

537
01:06:33,486 --> 01:06:35,321
I must be lightheaded or...

538
01:06:36,155 --> 01:06:37,615
...something because...

539
01:06:39,742 --> 01:06:41,119
...I'm trying.

540
01:06:41,869 --> 01:06:42,870
I'm trying.

541
01:06:44,622 --> 01:06:47,250
I can...l can't remember.

542
01:06:47,959 --> 01:06:49,293
Honest to God, I can't.

543
01:06:49,418 --> 01:06:51,087
I can't, I can't remember.

544
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:57,385
It's not there, Mr. Prosecutor.

545
01:06:57,635 --> 01:07:00,471
I don't know, it's not, it's not there.

546
01:07:01,014 --> 01:07:02,014
No.

547
01:07:06,144 --> 01:07:07,145
It's gone.

548
01:07:14,235 --> 01:07:15,320
He's dying.

549
01:09:18,067 --> 01:09:20,903
You're dead.

550
01:09:52,977 --> 01:09:54,604
Your term is completed.

551
01:10:38,189 --> 01:10:42,944
One, two, three, four...

552
01:10:43,361 --> 01:10:44,445
...five...

553
01:10:50,284 --> 01:10:51,327
...six.

554
01:10:53,287 --> 01:10:55,415
Oh, you son of a bitch.

555
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,638
Welcome to the Penal Colony...

556
01:11:11,389 --> 01:11:12,724
...of French Guiana...

557
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:16,060
...whose prisoners you are...

558
01:11:16,728 --> 01:11:18,854
...and from which there is no escape.

559
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,652
First attempts at escape...

560
01:11:25,278 --> 01:11:28,239
...add two years in solitary
to existing sentences.

561
01:11:32,118 --> 01:11:34,204
Second attempts, add five more.

562
01:11:36,748 --> 01:11:38,875
Of course, more serious offenses...

563
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:42,003
...are dealt with in this fashion.

564
01:11:57,143 --> 01:11:58,352
Hello, Papi!

565
01:12:02,482 --> 01:12:04,984
Don't take advantage. I'm in handcuffs.

566
01:12:06,527 --> 01:12:09,072
Make the best of what we offer you...

567
01:12:10,322 --> 01:12:12,617
...and you will suffer less than you deserve.

568
01:12:13,368 --> 01:12:14,202
Dismissed.

569
01:12:18,581 --> 01:12:20,583
Move! In the bunkhouse!

570
01:12:44,982 --> 01:12:47,485
I have hot soup, with real meat in it.

571
01:12:48,194 --> 01:12:49,737
Dega sent it to you.

572
01:13:06,629 --> 01:13:07,838
My name is Maturette.

573
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:26,000
How are you?

574
01:14:27,042 --> 01:14:28,502
Pretty good.

575
01:14:30,838 --> 01:14:34,425
You'd be in much better health, you know,
if you'd given them my name.

576
01:14:35,593 --> 01:14:36,552
I almost did.

577
01:14:38,263 --> 01:14:40,598
Someone once said
that temptation resisted...

578
01:14:43,267 --> 01:14:45,269
...is the true measure of character.

579
01:14:47,855 --> 01:14:49,398
How'd you get out of Kilo 40?

580
01:14:50,233 --> 01:14:52,610
It was the rankest sort of corruption.

581
01:14:52,985 --> 01:14:56,239
Suffice it to say the warden
now has a new house...

582
01:14:56,864 --> 01:14:58,741
...and I've become his chief clerk.

583
01:14:59,909 --> 01:15:00,910
Papi, look....

584
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:02,995
My wife and lawyer...

585
01:15:03,288 --> 01:15:06,499
...have convinced certain members
in the Ministry of Justice...

586
01:15:06,582 --> 01:15:08,459
...that my sentence was a bit harsh.

587
01:15:09,001 --> 01:15:10,753
Some months back I asked them...

588
01:15:11,504 --> 01:15:13,380
...to look into your case...

589
01:15:13,964 --> 01:15:16,092
...and they've made some headway.

590
01:15:16,426 --> 01:15:19,095
One of the principle witnesses
against you...

591
01:15:19,303 --> 01:15:21,764
...may be willing to change his story...

592
01:15:22,807 --> 01:15:23,808
...for a price.

593
01:15:24,267 --> 01:15:26,603
If this happened, when would it be?

594
01:15:26,978 --> 01:15:28,855
You could be out in perhaps three years.

595
01:15:29,313 --> 01:15:30,940
-Too long.
-No, it isn't.

596
01:15:31,774 --> 01:15:34,443
And with a good job,
the time will pass very quickly.

597
01:15:35,903 --> 01:15:37,155
Listen, my friend.

598
01:15:38,323 --> 01:15:39,490
You owe me nothing.

599
01:15:46,998 --> 01:15:48,291
Tell me what you want.

600
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:50,835
A boat.

601
01:15:57,592 --> 01:15:58,968
I should have known.

602
01:18:16,773 --> 01:18:18,858
Papi, don't you remember me?

603
01:18:19,942 --> 01:18:20,985
Clusiot.

604
01:18:21,235 --> 01:18:22,153
Yeah.

605
01:18:24,072 --> 01:18:25,197
What happened to your eyes?

606
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:32,414
I put some ground-up castor beans in 'em,
so I'd look sick enough to get in here.

607
01:18:32,997 --> 01:18:33,957
Why?

608
01:18:34,541 --> 01:18:35,958
I'm going with you.

609
01:18:36,459 --> 01:18:37,167
What?

610
01:18:37,501 --> 01:18:38,752
Yeah. Listen....

611
01:18:40,087 --> 01:18:42,632
Dega's got you on the x-ray list
for tomorrow.

612
01:18:43,299 --> 01:18:46,928
The x-ray doctor, he's a convict.
Some kind of Hindu or something.

613
01:18:47,053 --> 01:18:50,181
He's got somebody on the outside
who can sell you a boat...

614
01:18:50,848 --> 01:18:52,475
...if the price is right.

615
01:18:55,854 --> 01:18:57,271
When do we run, Papi?

616
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:04,737
Soon. I'll talk to that doctor tomorrow.

617
01:19:15,331 --> 01:19:17,708
The last boat I obtained was
for a sex murderer.

618
01:19:18,334 --> 01:19:21,587
They shot him to pieces
six miles down the river, poor man.

619
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:24,131
But the boat stood up very well.

620
01:19:25,007 --> 01:19:26,551
You have the heart of an ox.

621
01:19:26,842 --> 01:19:27,969
What kind of a boat?

622
01:19:28,052 --> 01:19:32,724
Fourteen feet, complete with compass,
sails, tools, clothes.

623
01:19:34,225 --> 01:19:37,270
The generator begins. Science takes over!

624
01:19:38,646 --> 01:19:41,691
You know, x-rays are quite worthless.
They always have been.

625
01:19:41,899 --> 01:19:43,526
Lie down, please, on the back.

626
01:19:44,568 --> 01:19:46,153
How much would it cost?

627
01:19:46,237 --> 01:19:49,365
Fr 3,000 in advance, which you pay to me...

628
01:19:49,407 --> 01:19:52,326
...and I pay to Pascal,
who provides everything.

629
01:19:52,577 --> 01:19:55,580
Draw a deep breath, please,
and hold completely still.

630
01:19:56,247 --> 01:20:00,292
Another Fr 3,000 you must pay directly
to Pascal when he delivers the boat.

631
01:20:00,751 --> 01:20:02,711
Exhale, please, and turn over.

632
01:20:04,255 --> 01:20:07,091
If I decide to make a deal,
how do we handle it?

633
01:20:08,217 --> 01:20:10,595
Have no fear. Ways will be found.

634
01:20:12,638 --> 01:20:14,557
Trust me for everything.

635
01:20:15,642 --> 01:20:18,728
The last time I did that
cost me two years in solitary.

636
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:21,647
So, you have been cheated, eh?

637
01:20:22,732 --> 01:20:25,234
Well, happily for you,
money doesn't tempt me.

638
01:20:25,318 --> 01:20:27,820
I'm after bigger game.
Draw a deep breath.

639
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:30,823
You see...

640
01:20:31,449 --> 01:20:33,242
...l killed my whole family.

641
01:20:33,785 --> 01:20:36,788
All of them. My wife and four little ones.

642
01:20:38,456 --> 01:20:40,541
Exhale, if you haven't already.

643
01:20:43,419 --> 01:20:45,797
You double-cross me, I'll kill ya.

644
01:20:46,923 --> 01:20:48,048
Of course...

645
01:20:49,425 --> 01:20:51,427
...l would consider that a favor.

646
01:20:52,178 --> 01:20:53,763
A very great favor.

647
01:21:14,325 --> 01:21:17,620
One of these nights I might ask you
to take that Turnkey into the toilet.

648
01:21:17,662 --> 01:21:20,707
Show him a good time.
When you come out you'll get Fr 1,000.

649
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:24,168
Why?

650
01:21:25,336 --> 01:21:28,798
That's my business. Your business is
to make him happy for ten minutes.

651
01:21:29,674 --> 01:21:30,675
Fr 1,000.

652
01:21:31,801 --> 01:21:32,844
He's filthy.

653
01:21:33,469 --> 01:21:35,930
All right, Fr 2,000.
Does that make him any cleaner?

654
01:21:41,978 --> 01:21:43,395
You think I'm a whore, don't you?

655
01:21:43,479 --> 01:21:44,396
Easy.

656
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,815
Well, you're wrong.

657
01:21:47,024 --> 01:21:48,067
Next.

658
01:23:11,108 --> 01:23:13,236
I'll do what you ask, on one condition:

659
01:23:14,612 --> 01:23:17,115
You keep your money
and you take me with you.

660
01:23:18,199 --> 01:23:19,033
No.

661
01:23:19,158 --> 01:23:21,494
I'm the only one
who can get you out of here.

662
01:23:29,377 --> 01:23:30,795
-You're--
-I know.

663
01:23:31,462 --> 01:23:35,424
I'm a queer, a fairy, a pouf, huh?

664
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:39,887
But there's one thing you forgot.

665
01:23:40,555 --> 01:23:43,099
You may have been framed,
as you say you were...

666
01:23:43,683 --> 01:23:44,934
...but I wasn't.

667
01:23:45,393 --> 01:23:47,061
Between the two of us...

668
01:23:47,812 --> 01:23:50,606
...I'm the one who's killed a man, not you.

669
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:57,113
Okay.

670
01:24:41,741 --> 01:24:43,618
It's tonight during the concert.

671
01:24:44,869 --> 01:24:48,039
I'll be there. I have to.
I'm serving refreshments.

672
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:51,959
I think you ought to go with us, Louis.

673
01:24:52,042 --> 01:24:53,669
-You ought to.
-Thank you.

674
01:24:54,921 --> 01:24:57,006
But my wife is arranging for my release.

675
01:24:57,090 --> 01:24:58,758
The letter from her is overdue.

676
01:25:02,845 --> 01:25:03,805
Listen to me.

677
01:25:05,557 --> 01:25:08,810
If your wife was here and you were in Paris
with all that money...

678
01:25:08,893 --> 01:25:10,687
...how much would you pay
to get her back?

679
01:25:11,646 --> 01:25:13,147
Everything I have.

680
01:25:15,358 --> 01:25:18,152
And how much would she pay
to get you back?

681
01:25:23,908 --> 01:25:25,576
That's why you should run.

682
01:25:26,619 --> 01:25:28,913
Now, Louis, while you've got a chance.

683
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:31,249
But I have a chance without running.

684
01:25:35,044 --> 01:25:36,420
Me, they can kill...

685
01:25:37,588 --> 01:25:38,923
...you, they own.

686
01:25:44,012 --> 01:25:45,013
Goodbye.

687
01:25:46,139 --> 01:25:47,223
Good luck.

688
01:30:57,116 --> 01:30:57,951
Clusiot!

689
01:31:14,092 --> 01:31:14,926
Clusiot!

690
01:31:18,805 --> 01:31:19,806
Halt!

691
01:31:30,274 --> 01:31:32,902
Dega, you bastard!

692
01:31:33,945 --> 01:31:35,279
-Guard!
-Shut up!

693
01:31:35,863 --> 01:31:36,906
Guard!

694
01:31:39,117 --> 01:31:40,242
Guard!

695
01:31:41,452 --> 01:31:42,411
Guard!

696
01:31:45,456 --> 01:31:46,458
Pull!

697
01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:48,459
Pull!

698
01:31:51,045 --> 01:31:52,046
Pull!

699
01:32:11,482 --> 01:32:12,316
Let's go.

700
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:14,276
Where's Clusiot?

701
01:32:14,402 --> 01:32:15,403
A guard got him.

702
01:32:15,486 --> 01:32:16,445
Let's go.

703
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,170
Here! Here!

704
01:32:33,462 --> 01:32:35,465
-Where's the other one?
-Right here.

705
01:32:35,548 --> 01:32:36,966
Just a little twist.

706
01:32:37,842 --> 01:32:39,260
Come on, come on.

707
01:33:23,179 --> 01:33:24,722
There's your boat over there.

708
01:33:26,808 --> 01:33:27,809
Fr 3,000.

709
01:33:34,732 --> 01:33:36,567
You'd better check her out,
see if she's okay.

710
01:33:36,609 --> 01:33:37,985
Come on. I'm in a hurry.

711
01:33:38,569 --> 01:33:39,987
Let's go! Let's go!

712
01:33:42,532 --> 01:33:46,410
I wouldn't use those guns if you don't want
the man hunters down on you.

713
01:33:47,745 --> 01:33:49,747
I put two gallons of rum aboard.

714
01:33:50,748 --> 01:33:53,125
Send me a postcard
when you get to Honduras.

715
01:34:11,269 --> 01:34:12,353
Let's have a drink of that rum.

716
01:34:24,365 --> 01:34:25,324
Why, this...

717
01:34:26,451 --> 01:34:28,119
...goddamn boat's no good.

718
01:34:28,327 --> 01:34:30,663
Look at it! I'll kill that bastard!

719
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,041
The son of a bitch is made of kindling.

720
01:34:33,124 --> 01:34:34,292
So is my leg.

721
01:34:36,627 --> 01:34:38,838
I didn't twist my ankle, I fractured it.

722
01:34:38,921 --> 01:34:40,256
You broke your leg?

723
01:34:40,965 --> 01:34:42,341
Why didn't you say something?

724
01:34:42,425 --> 01:34:44,927
I had the unworthy suspicion
you might leave me behind.

725
01:34:44,969 --> 01:34:46,637
You're goddamn right I would have.

726
01:34:46,721 --> 01:34:47,764
It's broken, all right.

727
01:34:47,805 --> 01:34:48,890
We've got to set this.

728
01:34:48,973 --> 01:34:50,016
I need your help.

729
01:34:50,099 --> 01:34:51,476
I presume it'll be painful.

730
01:34:51,559 --> 01:34:52,685
You bet it will.

731
01:34:53,269 --> 01:34:56,313
I ask you to remember that
that's my money that's sinking...

732
01:34:56,397 --> 01:34:58,899
...and that I'm here out of an act
of unnatural heroism...

733
01:34:58,983 --> 01:35:00,818
...which prevented a guard
from shooting you.

734
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:03,154
He probably would have
missed me anyway.

735
01:35:03,571 --> 01:35:04,405
Now relax.

736
01:35:04,489 --> 01:35:05,531
-What?
-Relax.

737
01:35:05,615 --> 01:35:07,742
You're at the wrong end.

738
01:35:11,788 --> 01:35:13,164
It'll only last a couple minutes.

739
01:35:18,752 --> 01:35:20,671
-Jesus!
-Hold him above the knee.

740
01:35:22,423 --> 01:35:23,466
Ready?

741
01:35:31,141 --> 01:35:32,350
That finishes it.

742
01:35:32,767 --> 01:35:34,143
How'd you do that?

743
01:35:35,311 --> 01:35:37,146
We've all got our sensitive spots.

744
01:35:37,438 --> 01:35:38,647
What happened?

745
01:35:38,856 --> 01:35:40,816
He found a sensitive spot
you didn't know you had.

746
01:36:00,753 --> 01:36:02,088
Move and you're dead.

747
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,174
Turn around.

748
01:36:06,384 --> 01:36:08,386
Throw that gun out in front of you.

749
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:13,516
You know I get Fr 200 for one of these.

750
01:36:13,892 --> 01:36:15,518
I wouldn't want to lose it.

751
01:36:15,810 --> 01:36:17,103
Turn around.

752
01:36:20,648 --> 01:36:23,859
You and two others broke out
of Saint Laurent last night, didn't you?

753
01:36:23,901 --> 01:36:24,902
That's right.

754
01:36:25,069 --> 01:36:26,195
The others are at the boat?

755
01:36:27,029 --> 01:36:27,947
That's right.

756
01:36:28,030 --> 01:36:29,198
And the boat's no good.

757
01:36:29,449 --> 01:36:30,533
Not worth a damn.

758
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:33,453
Been expecting you.

759
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,044
Come on.

760
01:36:48,926 --> 01:36:50,929
Don't shoot. It's okay.

761
01:36:56,559 --> 01:36:59,562
Caught these two man hunters asleep
just before sunup.

762
01:36:59,812 --> 01:37:02,022
They've been hanging around
for two days waiting on ya.

763
01:37:04,024 --> 01:37:07,320
Each time he sells that boat,
it's in worse shape than the last time.

764
01:37:11,032 --> 01:37:12,116
You like this?

765
01:37:13,326 --> 01:37:14,577
Oh, very much.

766
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:17,455
I did too, at the time, but I was drunk.

767
01:37:18,706 --> 01:37:20,249
Here, take this.

768
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,002
Cut yourself some bamboo
from around here...

769
01:37:23,085 --> 01:37:26,756
...and lash it together with sailcloth.
I'll be back around sunset.

770
01:37:29,633 --> 01:37:32,053
I'll tow you up river to Pigeon Island.

771
01:37:33,304 --> 01:37:36,057
You can get a boat there,
if you've got enough money.

772
01:37:37,016 --> 01:37:40,186
If you haven't got enough money
they'll probably kill ya.

773
01:37:40,437 --> 01:37:42,730
It doesn't matter much to them.
They're all lepers.

774
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:31,821
Noisy son of a bitch.

775
01:38:32,989 --> 01:38:34,365
Do dogs carry leprosy?

776
01:38:47,545 --> 01:38:48,546
Well...

777
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:50,590
...the hell with it.

778
01:38:50,673 --> 01:38:52,174
You better take this--

779
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:57,346
I don't want to fight these people.

780
01:38:57,388 --> 01:38:59,932
I just want to try to talk them
out of a boat.

781
01:39:48,189 --> 01:39:49,398
Who are you?

782
01:39:52,985 --> 01:39:54,487
Escaped prisoner, Papillon.

783
01:39:55,738 --> 01:39:57,156
Where are the other two?

784
01:39:57,698 --> 01:39:59,283
They're down on the beach.

785
01:39:59,951 --> 01:40:01,410
One's got a broken ankle.

786
01:40:02,704 --> 01:40:03,412
Come in.

787
01:40:47,957 --> 01:40:49,458
You have two rifles.

788
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:50,960
That's right.

789
01:40:51,001 --> 01:40:52,670
And you want a boat.

790
01:40:54,213 --> 01:40:55,298
That's right.

791
01:40:55,339 --> 01:40:57,049
But you're short of money.

792
01:40:59,343 --> 01:41:00,553
That's right, too.

793
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:05,683
Why don't you have the courtesy
to look at me when you speak?

794
01:41:17,987 --> 01:41:22,325
We do a lot of smuggling here.
We raid the mainland. We steal boats.

795
01:41:23,701 --> 01:41:25,536
When an outsider comes in...

796
01:41:25,578 --> 01:41:28,456
...we generally kill him,
as a security measure.

797
01:41:30,416 --> 01:41:31,876
That makes sense.

798
01:41:32,793 --> 01:41:33,794
Well...

799
01:41:34,754 --> 01:41:37,006
...a man of Christian understanding.

800
01:41:39,091 --> 01:41:40,551
Do you like cigars?

801
01:41:41,886 --> 01:41:42,845
When I can get 'em.

802
01:41:46,307 --> 01:41:47,559
Try this one.

803
01:42:18,756 --> 01:42:22,718
How did you know I have dry leprosy,
that it isn't contagious?

804
01:42:25,805 --> 01:42:26,973
I didn't.

805
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:56,502
In normal weather you should
sight Honduras in three and a half...

806
01:42:56,585 --> 01:42:57,586
...maybe four weeks.

807
01:42:59,005 --> 01:43:01,215
When you get there,
you'll need some money.

808
01:43:01,466 --> 01:43:02,592
We passed the hat.

809
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:06,179
Take it, it's disinfected.

810
01:43:09,307 --> 01:43:13,937
If you're going to catch leprosy, it's better
to catch it from money than from people.

811
01:43:18,149 --> 01:43:19,108
Take it.

812
01:43:22,862 --> 01:43:24,822
All we use it for is gambling...

813
01:43:25,823 --> 01:43:28,284
...bringing in women lepers from Albina.

814
01:43:29,827 --> 01:43:31,830
We've always got enough for that.

815
01:43:38,586 --> 01:43:41,589
Hurry up. Get on board,
you'll miss the tide.

816
01:43:56,187 --> 01:43:57,188
Goodbye.

817
01:44:34,350 --> 01:44:35,310
Honduras.

818
01:44:59,834 --> 01:45:02,253
My leg! Get it off my leg!

819
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:04,380
It's on my leg!

820
01:45:04,505 --> 01:45:06,048
Goddamn it!

821
01:46:06,817 --> 01:46:08,194
All right, come on.

822
01:46:08,486 --> 01:46:09,445
Come on, one more.

823
01:46:09,528 --> 01:46:12,240
-I'm already so drunk I can't think.
-Yeah.

824
01:46:13,324 --> 01:46:14,700
That's what I want.

825
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:21,541
I want you to put this between your teeth.

826
01:46:24,043 --> 01:46:25,962
It's going to hurt you, Louis.

827
01:46:29,006 --> 01:46:31,759
If you want to yell, yell.

828
01:46:31,968 --> 01:46:33,219
I certainly will.

829
01:47:03,958 --> 01:47:05,709
-I fooled you.
-What?

830
01:47:09,046 --> 01:47:10,631
I fooled you, didn't l?

831
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:31,087
One moment, please, seores.

832
01:48:31,129 --> 01:48:32,630
What do you want, Sergeant?

833
01:48:33,131 --> 01:48:35,841
Identification. Who are you?

834
01:48:36,383 --> 01:48:39,053
We're fishermen. Our friend here--

835
01:48:51,065 --> 01:48:52,442
Goddamn it, we...

836
01:48:52,733 --> 01:48:53,734
...we made it!

837
01:49:22,346 --> 01:49:23,389
Amigo.

838
01:49:30,187 --> 01:49:31,230
Por favor.

839
01:49:31,564 --> 01:49:34,483
Those bastards trussed me up like a pig.

840
01:51:49,035 --> 01:51:50,078
Trackers!

841
02:03:36,867 --> 02:03:38,703
Show your papers, please.

842
02:04:04,687 --> 02:04:05,855
Por favor.

843
02:04:07,565 --> 02:04:08,566
Seor...

844
02:04:10,776 --> 02:04:12,153
Dinero, por favor.

845
02:05:13,464 --> 02:05:14,549
What was your crime?

846
02:05:17,009 --> 02:05:17,760
Murder.

847
02:05:19,303 --> 02:05:21,931
I wasn't guilty.
I've never killed anybody in my life.

848
02:05:23,641 --> 02:05:26,561
If you did regain your freedom,
what would you do with it?

849
02:05:28,854 --> 02:05:31,107
I haven't had much time
to think about that.

850
02:05:31,399 --> 02:05:34,610
If you are a thief or a murderer,
by morning...

851
02:05:35,152 --> 02:05:37,113
...you might have stolen
everything we have.

852
02:05:43,202 --> 02:05:45,788
These are mine. They were a gift.

853
02:05:47,248 --> 02:05:49,208
You keep 'em, until I leave.

854
02:06:08,311 --> 02:06:09,729
Are you awake?

855
02:06:10,104 --> 02:06:11,313
Yes, ma'am.

856
02:06:27,872 --> 02:06:32,251
If you are sinful, you have made amends
by feeding half the poor in Santa Marta.

857
02:06:32,835 --> 02:06:35,505
If you are truly not sinful,
you have nothing to fear.

858
02:06:36,213 --> 02:06:37,840
God will watch over you.

859
02:07:54,041 --> 02:07:57,044
Your five years in solitary confinement
are at an end.

860
02:07:58,462 --> 02:08:00,673
You've paid part of your debt to France.

861
02:08:52,683 --> 02:08:53,685
Papi.

862
02:09:05,029 --> 02:09:05,988
I'm free.

863
02:10:46,422 --> 02:10:48,591
That's the only way off Devil's Island.

864
02:10:52,636 --> 02:10:54,639
We try to take things easy here.

865
02:10:56,599 --> 02:10:58,935
The sharks and the tide do
the real guard work...

866
02:10:58,976 --> 02:11:00,978
...so it's live and let live...

867
02:11:02,062 --> 02:11:03,940
...unless you make trouble.

868
02:11:08,194 --> 02:11:10,446
That one's empty.
You might as well take it.

869
02:11:10,529 --> 02:11:12,615
But watch yourself around the other huts.

870
02:11:12,698 --> 02:11:14,533
Someone might take you for a poacher
and kill you.

871
02:11:57,577 --> 02:11:59,704
How dare you sit there!

872
02:12:00,204 --> 02:12:02,582
This bench belongs to Captain Dreyfus!

873
02:12:03,249 --> 02:12:05,501
Who are you to sit on that bench?

874
02:12:07,044 --> 02:12:07,962
Nobody.

875
02:12:08,546 --> 02:12:10,673
That's right. Nobody.

876
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:13,926
Do you know who I am?

877
02:12:40,119 --> 02:12:41,037
Dega?

878
02:12:48,460 --> 02:12:49,337
Dega!

879
02:12:55,301 --> 02:12:56,302
Dega.

880
02:13:07,146 --> 02:13:08,147
Dega!

881
02:13:29,168 --> 02:13:30,002
Louis.

882
02:13:34,382 --> 02:13:35,383
Louis.

883
02:13:40,805 --> 02:13:42,682
I wish you hadn't come here.

884
02:13:53,484 --> 02:13:55,277
Are you fond of crayfish?

885
02:14:27,018 --> 02:14:28,019
Good.

886
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:31,647
You really think so?

887
02:14:32,273 --> 02:14:34,483
Best I've had in years.

888
02:14:41,407 --> 02:14:42,867
Did you hear about my wife?

889
02:14:44,660 --> 02:14:48,414
She married my attorney,
or else he married her...

890
02:14:48,915 --> 02:14:51,751
...although actually,
it doesn't really matter.

891
02:14:52,376 --> 02:14:55,963
I mean, it all works out to the same thing,
don't you think?

892
02:15:02,845 --> 02:15:06,224
Well, I have not heard from her in about--

893
02:15:08,977 --> 02:15:10,645
It is nice here, isn't it?

894
02:15:12,396 --> 02:15:14,232
You've made it nice, Louis.

895
02:15:16,317 --> 02:15:17,484
Really nice.

896
02:15:21,155 --> 02:15:22,323
It's funny...

897
02:15:23,991 --> 02:15:25,826
...you and me ending up here.

898
02:15:28,037 --> 02:15:29,706
We're the only ones left.

899
02:15:33,501 --> 02:15:34,710
Do you ever wonder about it?

900
02:15:35,086 --> 02:15:36,087
No.

901
02:15:38,380 --> 02:15:39,423
I do.

902
02:15:42,927 --> 02:15:43,928
Get away!

903
02:15:46,722 --> 02:15:48,724
Get away! Get away!

904
02:15:50,143 --> 02:15:51,311
That's enough!

905
02:16:03,823 --> 02:16:06,075
They come in, steal from my garden.

906
02:16:06,450 --> 02:16:07,493
Who does?

907
02:16:13,374 --> 02:16:14,625
Maybe I'd better go.

908
02:16:15,126 --> 02:16:15,960
Yes.

909
02:16:19,964 --> 02:16:22,675
I know your house. There's no ghost in it.

910
02:16:59,169 --> 02:17:00,921
My thoughts are with you.

911
02:17:29,870 --> 02:17:30,872
Jesus!

912
02:18:01,944 --> 02:18:03,738
Louis!

913
02:18:04,739 --> 02:18:08,200
Come look. Remember those seeds
that Sergeant Santini gave me last month?

914
02:18:08,284 --> 02:18:09,160
They've come up.

915
02:18:09,243 --> 02:18:10,495
We'll have carrots.

916
02:18:10,578 --> 02:18:13,456
It said six weeks on the packet
but it's only taken four.

917
02:18:13,539 --> 02:18:17,208
If I could find a way to get off this island,
would you like to come with me?

918
02:18:17,375 --> 02:18:18,708
Oh, yes, of course.

919
02:18:18,833 --> 02:18:21,377
Get away!
Freddie, you know better than that.

920
02:18:23,837 --> 02:18:25,506
I've got no money. They took it all.

921
02:18:25,589 --> 02:18:26,882
Forget about that.

922
02:18:27,007 --> 02:18:28,467
You can't buy your way out of here.

923
02:18:28,551 --> 02:18:29,385
Then how?

924
02:18:31,637 --> 02:18:32,722
I don't know yet.

925
02:18:33,013 --> 02:18:36,392
Then, then we don't have to discuss it.
Tell me, do you like tomatoes?

926
02:18:36,726 --> 02:18:40,104
I have some extra seeds.
You might like to start your own garden.

927
02:19:05,295 --> 02:19:07,089
You see, it's a horseshoe.

928
02:19:08,758 --> 02:19:11,635
When the waves break
they have no place else to go...

929
02:19:11,719 --> 02:19:13,512
...except go back out again.

930
02:19:13,762 --> 02:19:16,098
Well, you can't launch a boat from here.

931
02:19:17,141 --> 02:19:20,728
In fact, there's no place on the entire island
where you can launch a boat.

932
02:19:21,103 --> 02:19:24,026
Bags of coconuts tied together,
just throw 'em over...

933
02:19:25,528 --> 02:19:27,113
...float out on a wave.

934
02:19:29,115 --> 02:19:30,783
Then what happens?

935
02:19:31,450 --> 02:19:35,204
The mainland's only 24 miles.
You just drift with the current.

936
02:19:38,416 --> 02:19:39,750
Only two days.

937
02:19:40,375 --> 02:19:41,958
-You're certain?
-Yeah.

938
02:19:44,418 --> 02:19:47,463
It seems so, so desperate.

939
02:19:48,797 --> 02:19:49,757
Yeah.

940
02:19:51,467 --> 02:19:52,593
You think it will work?

941
02:19:54,595 --> 02:19:55,888
Does it matter?

942
02:20:02,645 --> 02:20:05,067
Get! Now, that's not yours.

943
02:20:05,735 --> 02:20:06,860
Now, you get away.

944
02:20:06,944 --> 02:20:09,989
I'm not going to tell you again.
Here you are, Freddie.

945
02:20:10,323 --> 02:20:12,408
Freddie's not feeling well today and...

946
02:20:12,492 --> 02:20:14,494
...you should appreciate that fact.

947
02:20:15,369 --> 02:20:16,537
Here we are.

948
02:20:19,457 --> 02:20:20,625
Okay, little one.

949
02:20:20,916 --> 02:20:21,666
All right.

950
02:20:24,291 --> 02:20:25,334
Freddie!

951
02:20:26,544 --> 02:20:28,921
Freddie, that's not for you, that's Adam's.

952
02:20:29,463 --> 02:20:30,839
Come here, Adam.

953
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:33,801
Let's take a walk.

954
02:20:33,885 --> 02:20:36,846
Certainly. Isn't that a little small?

955
02:20:38,639 --> 02:20:40,933
-It's just to try it with.
-Certainly.

956
02:20:43,060 --> 02:20:46,025
You know, I've been thinking
of building a porch.

957
02:20:47,318 --> 02:20:50,237
There's not a home on the entire island
with a porch.

958
02:20:51,405 --> 02:20:53,824
Not even Sergeant Santini has a porch.

959
02:20:54,408 --> 02:20:57,036
-What do you think, huh?
-Come on.

960
02:23:24,639 --> 02:23:26,183
It was the wrong wave.

961
02:23:28,059 --> 02:23:29,060
Oh, yeah.

962
02:23:31,062 --> 02:23:33,109
They come in a series of seven.

963
02:23:33,526 --> 02:23:35,487
And the seventh wave is big enough...

964
02:23:35,945 --> 02:23:38,406
...to take us both out
beyond the point of return.

965
02:23:41,117 --> 02:23:42,118
Are you certain?

966
02:23:42,285 --> 02:23:43,286
Yeah.

967
02:23:44,871 --> 02:23:45,831
Excellent.

968
02:23:51,083 --> 02:23:53,960
Oh, if we're going
I'd better pick those carrots.

969
02:24:09,434 --> 02:24:10,769
Fourth wave.

970
02:24:20,740 --> 02:24:21,699
Ready?

971
02:24:22,575 --> 02:24:24,160
I must tell you something.

972
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:28,206
Louis, you don't have to say anything.

973
02:24:29,750 --> 02:24:30,833
I meant to.

974
02:24:32,833 --> 02:24:33,791
I'm sorry.

975
02:24:36,002 --> 02:24:37,003
I know.

976
02:24:41,298 --> 02:24:42,592
You'll be killed.

977
02:24:43,551 --> 02:24:44,719
You know that?

978
02:24:46,054 --> 02:24:46,888
Maybe.

979
02:24:48,306 --> 02:24:49,891
Please, don't do it.

980
02:27:33,805 --> 02:27:36,933
Hey, you bastards, I'm still here!

981
02:27:50,116 --> 02:27:52,077
Papillon made it to freedom.

982
02:27:53,411 --> 02:27:57,124
And for the remaining years of his life
he lived a free man.

983
02:27:59,833 --> 02:28:02,792
This, the infamous penal system
in French Guiana...

984
02:28:03,751 --> 02:28:05,086
...did not survive him.
