1
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:54,085
Well, then... Urrmm, now.

2
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,924
Ill begin at the beginnin.

3
00:01:57,128 --> 00:02:00,120
A fine, soft day in the spring it was

4
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:04,162
when the train pulled into Castletown,
three hours late as usual,

5
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:06,518
and himself got out.

6
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:10,640
He didnt have the look
of an American tourist at all about him,

7
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:14,840
not a camera on him and, what was worst,
not even a fishing-rod.

8
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:18,442
Castletown?

9
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:28,482
- Castletown?
- Could you tell me the way to Inisfree?

10
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:32,394
Inisfree? Aw, five miles and maybe a half more.

11
00:02:32,605 --> 00:02:34,675
- Do you see that road over there?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:39,515
Dont take that one, itll do you no good.
Now, the best road to Inisfree, and many...

13
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:44,434
Oh, Inisfree you want. Be savin your breath,
let me direct the gentleman.

14
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:46,123
Happen to know the way to Knoghenor?

15
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:50,236
If you knew the way there,
would he be asking the way to Inisfree?

16
00:02:50,443 --> 00:02:52,957
Theres many knows Knoghenor
that doesnt know Inisfree.

17
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:56,438
If youd take the time to study
your countrys history, Mr Maloney...

18
00:02:56,642 --> 00:03:00,555
- ...youd be the first to admit it.
- Dont send the poor man there.

19
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:04,959
The fishing is finished there entirely.
Tell me, Yank, what is it that youre after?

20
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:08,756
- Is it trout or salmon?
- All I want is to get to Inisfree.

21
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:12,078
Ah, now youre talking sense.
The best fishing in the country.

22
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:15,795
- True.
- Trout as long as your arm.

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,596
And salmon! The last one I got,
I expected Jonah to pop out of his mouth.

24
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,472
Ah, Inisfree. Id bring you there myself,

25
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:25,636
only I got to drive the train.

26
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,752
Hey, was I tellin you about that trout
I got two summers before last?

27
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,599
- At Inisfree?
- Not at all!

28
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,869
At Ballygar, over the other end of the country.

29
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,709
My sisters third young one is living at Inisfree,

30
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,513
and shed be only too happy
to show you the road.

31
00:03:43,718 --> 00:03:47,757
- No, no, if she was here.
- Its Inisfree the man wants to go to.

32
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:52,314
- You see that signpost over there?
- What do you know...

33
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:09,588
Inisfree, this way.

34
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:38,184
I wonder, now, why a man would go to Inisfree.

35
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:06,338
- Six foot six?
- Four and a half.

36
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:27,504
- Cincinnati?
- No, Pittsburgh.

37
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,857
Pi..Pitss...

38
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:50,333
Dont you remember, Seaneen, and how it was.

39
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:56,175
The road led up past the chapel,
and it wound, and it wound,

40
00:05:56,385 --> 00:06:00,776
and there was the field where
Dan Tobins bull chased you.

41
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:06,182
It was a lovely little house, Seaneen,
and the roses.!

42
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:12,140
Your father used to tease me about them,
but he was that proud of them, too.

43
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:18,450
Thats nothin but a wee humble cottage.

44
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,018
That little place across the brook,
that humble cottage. Who owns it now?

45
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,734
The widow Tillane. Not that she lives there.

46
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,135
- You think shed sell it?
- I doubt it.

47
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,058
Dont bet on it cause Im buyin it.

48
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:52,696
Why...why would a Yankee from Pittsburgh
want to buy it?

49
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:56,938
Ill tell you why, Michaleen Oge Flynn,
young small Michael Flynn,

50
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:59,527
who used to wipe my runny nose
when I was kid.

51
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:04,095
Because Im Sean Thornton,
and I was born in that little cottage.

52
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:08,448
And Ive come home, and home Im gonna stay.

53
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:12,730
Does that answer your questions
once and for all, you nosy little man?

54
00:07:12,937 --> 00:07:17,214
Seaneen Thornton... The...

55
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:19,729
And look at you now.

56
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:23,167
What do they feed you,
all you men who are in Pittsburgh?

57
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:29,450
Steel, and pig-iron furnaces so hot
a man forgets his fear of hell.

58
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:34,172
When youre hard enough,
tough enough...other things.

59
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:38,644
Other things, Michaleen.

60
00:07:55,972 --> 00:08:00,888
Now then, here comes myself,
thats me there, walking.

61
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:07,611
That tall, saintly-looking man.
Peter Lonergan, parish priest.

62
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:11,406
Good day, Father. Sean, this is Father Lonergan.

63
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:16,445
Father, would you believe it?
This is Sean Thornton,

64
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,848
born right here in Inisfree, home from America.

65
00:08:20,051 --> 00:08:22,961
- Hello, Father.
- Ah, yes.

66
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,764
I knew your people, Sean.

67
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:32,124
Your grandfather...
He died in Australia, in a penal colony.

68
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:35,764
And your father, he was a good man too.

69
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:39,484
Bad accident, that. And your mother?

70
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:42,646
Shes dead. America, when I was twelve.

71
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:48,767
Ill remember her in the mass tomorrow.
Youll be there, seven oclock.

72
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:50,878
- Sure, I will.
- Good.

73
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:54,159
Sean, Id like to have a little word
with Michaleen here.

74
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,005
- Sure thing, Father.
- Itll only take a minute.

75
00:08:57,206 --> 00:09:00,403
- Its a little matter...
- Take your time. Ill be up ahead.

76
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,715
(MICHALEEN): Sean!

77
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:17,677
Hey, is that real?. She couldnt be.

78
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:23,349
Uh, nonsense, man. Its only a mirage
brought on by your terrible thirst.

79
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:26,277
Come up, Napoleon.

80
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:23,867
Over here we pronounce it Co-han.

81
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:35,338
Good morning.

82
00:12:56,262 --> 00:13:01,700
None of that now.
Its a bold, sinful man you are, Sean Thornton.

83
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:05,530
Who told you to playing patty fingers
in the Holy Water?

84
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,937
- Just being polite, thats all.
- What is this?

85
00:13:08,142 --> 00:13:11,099
Maybe you dont know
its a privilege only for courting couples,

86
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:13,735
and then only when the banns have been read.

87
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,696
And Mary Kate Danaher
dippin her fingers in as neat as you please.

88
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,336
- What did you say her name was?
- Mary Kate Danaher.

89
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:25,609
And dont be getting any notions in your head.

90
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:29,367
- Mary Kate...
- Forget it, Sean, forget it.

91
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:32,377
- Put it out of your mind.
- Why? Whats the matter?

92
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,729
- She isnt married or anything?
- Married? That one?

93
00:13:35,938 --> 00:13:39,214
Not likely. And her
with her freckles and her temper.

94
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:43,012
Oh, that red head of hers is no lie.

95
00:13:43,217 --> 00:13:46,846
Still, a man might put up with that
but not with her lack of a fortune.

96
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:02,974
The wealthiest woman in Inisfree
was the widow Tillane.

97
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,609
She had neither chick nor child, poor soul,

98
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:09,649
but she was well-respected
and good to the poor.

99
00:14:10,654 --> 00:14:13,374
- So you were born there, is that it?
- Yes, maam.

100
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:16,805
All Thorntons were born there,
seven generations.

101
00:14:17,014 --> 00:14:20,450
I see. And what is your thought, Mr Thornton,

102
00:14:20,654 --> 00:14:24,726
are you planning to turn
White O Mornin into a national shrine?

103
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:28,289
Perhaps charge tuppence a visit
for a guided tour

104
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:33,771
through the cottage where the Thorntons
were born. Are you a man of such eminence?

105
00:14:33,972 --> 00:14:35,725
No, not exactly.

106
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:41,803
My own family has been in Ireland since
the Normans came hundreds of years ago,

107
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:46,688
but weve seen no reason to establish
monuments or memorials...

108
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:51,009
Look, Mrs Tillane, Im not talking about
memorials or monuments.

109
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:56,203
Ever since I was a kid
living in a shack near the slag heaps,

110
00:14:56,409 --> 00:15:00,528
my mother has told me about
Inisfree and White O Mornin.

111
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:05,008
Inisfree has become
another word for heaven to me.

112
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,919
When I quit the... When I decided to come here,
it was with one thought in mind.

113
00:15:10,128 --> 00:15:12,961
Inisfree is far from being a heaven, Mr Thornton.

114
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:16,922
Maam, Mr Red Will Danaher
wishes to be announced,

115
00:15:17,128 --> 00:15:20,006
I mean, Squire Danaher.

116
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,199
Watch your muddy boots!

117
00:15:28,248 --> 00:15:30,966
- Mrs Tillane.
- Mr Thornton, from America.

118
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,123
- Aw!
- Boo.

119
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:36,876
Its him Im here about, Mrs Tillane.

120
00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:39,646
- (WILL): Is it true?
- Is what true?

121
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:44,361
That behind me back, hes trying to steal
White O Mornin right from under me nose?

122
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:47,557
And what concern of yours is this, Will Danaher?

123
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:51,121
Concern? Concern enough.

124
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:54,524
Havent I made you a fair offer
for that same piece of land?

125
00:15:54,725 --> 00:15:59,195
- And mine, lying right next to yours?
- You may keep your offers.

126
00:15:59,404 --> 00:16:04,431
- Oh, so its true. You sold it!
- No, I have not.

127
00:16:07,563 --> 00:16:12,717
Oh, I knew it was a dirty lie
the very minute I heard it!

128
00:16:12,924 --> 00:16:15,436
Sure, I said to him,

129
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:19,601
Paggy McFarland, I wont believe
that Sarahd be selling White O Mornin.

130
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:23,673
(WILL): Why, it would be like building a fence
between your land and mine.

131
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:29,512
And for a stranger to move in, says I.
What would she be doing that for?

132
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,440
And us so close to an understanding,
you might say.

133
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:35,678
- So you told him all that?
- That I did.

134
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,395
Down at the pub, I suppose,
in front of all those big ears,

135
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,148
with pints in their fists
and pipes in their mouths.

136
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:46,591
You may have the land, Mr Thornton,
for 600 pounds.

137
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,835
- Done!
- No, you cant. 610!

138
00:16:50,038 --> 00:16:52,950
As I remember, you said 700 pounds.

139
00:16:53,158 --> 00:16:57,230
See here, little man... 710!

140
00:16:57,437 --> 00:17:00,908
- How about an even thousand?
- A thousand and...

141
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:06,793
And...and Ill be saying good day to you,
Mrs Tillane, and all here but one.

142
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:09,955
And Ive got you down in my book.

143
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:15,512
My dad remembers his dad well.

144
00:17:15,716 --> 00:17:19,072
Mike Thornton.
He had shoulders on him like an ox.

145
00:17:19,276 --> 00:17:25,305
I saw him meself this mornin. A tall,
handsome man, as I was passin that chapel.

146
00:17:25,515 --> 00:17:31,350
If youd pass the pub as fast as you pass
the chapel, youd be better off, little squint.

147
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:53,231
Just look at them!
Eating me out of house and home.

148
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:57,391
Get back to the fields! Theres work to be done.

149
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:11,109
Isnt it a bit early in the day
for the bottle...even for you?

150
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:14,269
Feeney, get your book out.

151
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:20,743
Set down the name, the one Sean Thornton.

152
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,339
Oh, look at me clean floor! You dirty little...

153
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:29,463
- Shut your gob.
- Aw, shut you, little man! Here.

154
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:33,025
Clean it up yourself,
or there will be no dinner tonight!

155
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:40,499
There now! Look now,
you mustnt mind himself this day.

156
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:44,222
Thats all the work youre good for,
you little tattletail.

157
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:49,654
- Feeney, have you written the name I gave you?
- I have.

158
00:18:49,866 --> 00:18:55,419
Well, strike a line through it.
Thats for him. Sean Thornton...

159
00:18:56,306 --> 00:19:00,858
So... He bought White O Mornin
in spite of you.

160
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:07,819
Good for widow Tillane.

161
00:19:08,385 --> 00:19:12,172
Pay no attention to her at all! Take no notice.

162
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,422
You do, and therell be a fine wake
in this house tonight.

163
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:19,173
After all, hes got more right to that land
than you have!

164
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:32,978
Hell regret it to his dying day,
if ever he lives that long.

165
00:19:35,662 --> 00:19:40,656
- Will it be all right if I leave my bags in here?
- I imagine theyll be safe enough.

166
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:46,775
If you see a little guy, Michaleen Flynn,
tell him Im waiting for him in the bar.

167
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:51,098
- Itll be a pleasure, especially for Michaleen.
- Thanks.

168
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,610
Is there anything you should like now, Yank?

169
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:59,898
If I think of anything, Ill let you know.

170
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:08,258
(BAR IS QUIET)

171
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:11,689
Evening.

172
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:17,412
Pleasant night.

173
00:20:20,098 --> 00:20:24,409
- Ill try one of those black beers.
- Oh, the porter. Yes, sir.

174
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:34,491
Sir, will you join me? Matter of fact,
Id like to buy everybody a drink.

175
00:20:34,697 --> 00:20:39,087
I do not believe I heard your name, tall man.

176
00:20:39,296 --> 00:20:41,810
Thornton. Sean Thornton.

177
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,248
And... your fathers name?

178
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:51,528
Mike. Michael Thornton.
He used to live here, by the Mornin.

179
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:55,693
I just bought the place back.
Thats why Im here.

180
00:20:55,894 --> 00:21:01,412
Then your grandfather
would be Ol Sean Thornton.

181
00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:05,242
- Right.
- Bless his memory.

182
00:21:05,453 --> 00:21:07,809
So its himself youre named after.

183
00:21:08,014 --> 00:21:14,087
Well, now. That being the case, it is
a pleasant evening and we will have a drink.

184
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:21,287
* There was a wild colonial boy

185
00:21:21,492 --> 00:21:25,450
#Jack Duggan was his name

186
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:31,404
# He was born and bred in Ireland

187
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:35,924
# In a town called Castlemaine

188
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,920
- Good evening, Father.
- Is the rest of the committee here?

189
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:41,882
- Theyre waiting.
- Sorry were late.

190
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:47,163
- The fishing was bad, was it?
- Fine lot of time we had for that!

191
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:50,681
- Oh, Michaleen...
- Commandant Forbes.

192
00:21:50,888 --> 00:21:54,847
You can forget about the Commandant.
Were at peace now.

193
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:57,926
Sure, but I havent given up hope.

194
00:21:58,128 --> 00:22:02,803
- Your Yankee friend is waitin in the bar.
- Oh, hes here already...

195
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:05,475
Wait a minute. Who is he anyway?

196
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:11,443
Hes a nice, quiet, peacelovin man
come home to Ireland to forget his troubles.

197
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:16,117
- Troubles?
- Yes, hes a millionaire like all the Yanks.

198
00:22:16,326 --> 00:22:19,682
But he is eccentric. Wait till I show you.

199
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:26,435
- What is it?
- A bag to sleep in. A sleeper bag they call it.

200
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:31,400
Im tellin you. The sleeper bag...
Wait till I show you how it operates.

201
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:34,243
- Where does it open?
- Hurry up, I have an important appointment.

202
00:22:34,444 --> 00:22:36,559
- Well, open it up!
- Here.

203
00:22:36,763 --> 00:22:41,279
# At the early age of sixteen years

204
00:22:41,483 --> 00:22:45,556
# He left his native home

205
00:22:45,762 --> 00:22:50,631
# And to Australias sunny shores

206
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:55,233
# He was inclined to roam

207
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:59,992
# He robbed a wealthy squireen

208
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:04,671
# All arms he did destroy

209
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:09,397
# A terror to Australia was

210
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,390
# This wild colonial boy

211
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,953
Sean Thornton, the men of Inisfree
bid you welcome home.

212
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,115
Thank you.

213
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,156
And the men of Inisfree
bid you welcome home.

214
00:23:29,878 --> 00:23:33,393
- Whats wrong with that little speech?
- Oh, youd be knowin what.

215
00:23:40,998 --> 00:23:44,546
Im a man from Inisfree, and the best man.

216
00:23:45,197 --> 00:23:47,711
And I bid no welcome to a man fool enough

217
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:52,194
to pay 1000 pounds for a bit of land
that isnt worth 200!

218
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:53,989
True for you, squire.

219
00:23:54,197 --> 00:24:00,430
(MAN): Didnt I hear of someone
named Danaher bid 810?

220
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:08,313
Get your book out.
Put his name down: Dermot Fahy.

221
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:12,632
F-A-H-Y. No es, Squireen Danaher.

222
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:14,506
If you were half the man you think you are,

223
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:18,024
you wouldnt begrudge a Thornton
the right to his birthplace.

224
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:21,909
- What right has he to a land hes never worked?
- Its Thornton land, isnt it?

225
00:24:22,114 --> 00:24:25,423
- Youve too much of your own as it is.
- Quiet, if you please.

226
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:29,705
Parliamentary procedure.
Squire Danaher has the floor.

227
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:32,870
If I had the floor...

228
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:37,029
- ...Id hit that big ape with it.
- Hold on.

229
00:24:37,232 --> 00:24:40,304
I dont blame Mr Danaher for gettin on his ear.

230
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:44,823
Whos on his ear? Why, you and ten like you
couldnt put a Danaher on his ear.

231
00:24:45,031 --> 00:24:48,023
- Its just a way of speaking...
- Mind your ways, then.

232
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:53,702
The point is, its already done. I own
the property now, and since were neighbours...

233
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,264
Neighbours? Neighbours...

234
00:24:57,548 --> 00:24:58,949
Never!

235
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,586
And if I so much as catch you putting
one foot on my property, I...I...

236
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:08,021
And, oh, another thing.
You keep away from my sister Mary Kate.

237
00:25:08,229 --> 00:25:10,298
Shes not for the likes of you.

238
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:14,706
Where I come from, we dont talk
about our womenfolk in saloons.

239
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:18,025
You sort of make a habit of it.
This morning it was widow Tillane.

240
00:25:18,228 --> 00:25:22,380
- Whats that?
- Thats true. Its ashamed you should be.

241
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:26,819
Hey, look, Im not accusing Mary Kate.
Its him.

242
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:30,621
Why, this very moment,
let him deny it if he can.

243
00:25:30,826 --> 00:25:34,182
At the back of the chapel,
he took liberties that he shouldnt have.

244
00:25:34,386 --> 00:25:37,583
- I said good morning to her.
- Good morning?

245
00:25:37,785 --> 00:25:40,858
- It was good night you had on your mind.
- Thats a lie.

246
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:42,896
(MUSIC STOPS)

247
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:46,545
- Thats a what?
- I said thats a lie.

248
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:52,616
Thats a word I take from no man!
Put up your fists.

249
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:55,180
- Im not gonna fight you.
- But Im gonna...

250
00:25:57,903 --> 00:25:59,701
Thank you.

251
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:05,380
(FATHER): Danaher!
Whats the matter with you?

252
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:08,541
(FORBES): Hes drunk!
Feeney, take him home, will you.

253
00:26:08,743 --> 00:26:11,381
(FEENEY): Dont soil your knuckles on the man.

254
00:26:11,581 --> 00:26:14,222
- Come on, what do you say?
- Never.

255
00:26:14,423 --> 00:26:17,060
Take the mans hand, or Ill read your name
on a mass on Sunday.

256
00:26:17,261 --> 00:26:20,298
- (FEENEY): Take it.
- Id join the Church of Ireland first.

257
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:24,891
As if theyd have you.
Shake his hand like I tell you.

258
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,218
- (FEENEY): Come on, come on.
- Shake hands?

259
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,575
Its a good grip you have.
I always hated a flappy handshake myself.

260
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,292
Father Paul!

261
00:26:52,498 --> 00:26:57,048
Michaleen, introduce me to this quiet,
peacelovin man of yours.

262
00:26:57,257 --> 00:27:00,614
I have a strange notion
were going to be friends, Yank.

263
00:27:00,818 --> 00:27:04,446
Give me a minute.
Just let some blood run back into this.

264
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:11,368
Sean Thornton... His grandfather,
a grand man he was, was hung in Australia.

265
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:17,013
I could tell you blood-curdlin stories about him,
but me throat...

266
00:27:17,215 --> 00:27:19,855
(SEAN): All right, come on.

267
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:25,969
# He was born and bred in Ireland

268
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:30,725
# In a town called Castlemaine

269
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:35,849
# He was his fathers only son

270
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:40,683
# His mothers pride and joy

271
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:45,842
# And dearly did his parents love

272
00:27:46,053 --> 00:27:48,931
# This wild colonial boy

273
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:44,635
Are you sure you wont change your mind,
and come around home with me?

274
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:48,555
Dont worry about it.
Ive got my sleeping bag, havent I.

275
00:28:49,407 --> 00:28:52,523
Well, its a nice, soft night.

276
00:28:52,726 --> 00:28:57,436
So, I think Illjoin my comrades,
and talk a little treason.

277
00:28:58,245 --> 00:29:00,806
- Good night, Sean.
- Good night, Michaleen.

278
00:29:01,486 --> 00:29:02,759
(MICHALEEN): God bless you.

279
00:30:31,636 --> 00:30:34,355
(SEAN YELLS)

280
00:30:35,956 --> 00:30:37,274
(MARY KATE SCREAMS)

281
00:31:03,552 --> 00:31:06,465
So bold one you are.
Who gave you leave to be kissin me?

282
00:31:06,673 --> 00:31:10,108
- So you can talk?
- Yes, I can, I will, and I do.

283
00:31:10,312 --> 00:31:12,872
Its more than talk youll be gettin
if you step closer.

284
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:16,622
- Dont worry. Youve got a wallop.
- Youll get over it, Im thinkin.

285
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:20,984
Some things a man doesnt get over so easily.

286
00:31:21,192 --> 00:31:23,784
Like what supposin?

287
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:29,224
Like the sight of a girl coming through the fields,
with the sun on her hair.

288
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:35,379
- Kneeling in church, with a face like a saint.
- Saint, indeed.

289
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:39,424
And now, coming to a mans house
to clean it for him.

290
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:42,939
But...that was just my way
of bein a good Christian act.

291
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:47,188
I know it was, Mary Kate Danaher,
and it was nice of you.

292
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,903
Not at all.

293
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:09,968
- Hello.
- Good morning, Mr Thornton.

294
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:13,331
- How are you, Fa..Doctor...
- No, no. Mr.

295
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:17,248
And on formal occasions,
the Reverend Mr Playfair.

296
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:19,211
And this is Mrs Playfair.

297
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:23,889
(MRS PLAYFAIR): Well, Mr Thornton.
You are a wonder.

298
00:33:24,098 --> 00:33:30,253
It looks the way all the Irish cottages
should...and so seldom do.

299
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:35,009
And only an American
would have thought of emerald green.

300
00:33:35,218 --> 00:33:40,372
- Red is more durable.
- And the roses! How nice.

301
00:33:40,578 --> 00:33:46,526
Youll need lots of horse manure.
Fertiliser, I mean. Horse is the best.

302
00:33:46,737 --> 00:33:52,971
Oh, I brought you a plant.
You know, a primrose by a rivers brink.

303
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:57,407
Brim, not brink.
The next line ends in hymn.

304
00:33:57,615 --> 00:34:02,245
Poets are so silly, arent they?
Oh, I hope youre not one, Mr Thornton.

305
00:34:02,455 --> 00:34:05,605
- Oh no, maam, I...
- Thornton.

306
00:34:06,734 --> 00:34:08,965
Theres a familiar ring to it.

307
00:34:11,415 --> 00:34:14,850
Ring to it... Thornton...

308
00:34:16,094 --> 00:34:19,768
Its a common name.
Thank you for the plant, Mrs Playfair,

309
00:34:19,973 --> 00:34:23,362
this is damn...darn...awfully nice of you.

310
00:34:24,532 --> 00:34:26,569
Oh?

311
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,808
Its a bed. Excuse me.

312
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,557
- Morning.
- (MAN): Thats a fine big bed, Mr Thornton.

313
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:54,409
Biggest one I could find.

314
00:35:08,729 --> 00:35:12,004
Is that a bed or a parade ground?

315
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:16,247
Oh, a mand have to be a sprinter
to catch his wife in a bed like that.

316
00:35:27,607 --> 00:35:29,801
(HORSE WHINNIES)

317
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:33,596
Whoa!

318
00:35:51,444 --> 00:35:57,359
Mr Flynn... And what are you
all dressed up for, Michaleen Oge?

319
00:36:00,483 --> 00:36:02,633
I ha...

320
00:36:07,883 --> 00:36:11,875
- I have come...
- Oh, I can see that.

321
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:15,597
- But from whose pub was it?
- P...pub?

322
00:36:16,722 --> 00:36:21,841
Youve a tongue like an adder.
I go about me own business,

323
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:26,398
and tell Thorn Seanton
hes well off without you.

324
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,148
Wait a minute. What was that?

325
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:35,639
Well, if you listened
and not be interruptin the matchmaker.

326
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:42,355
I have come...

327
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,393
- ...at the request of Thorn Seanton...
- Sean Thornton.

328
00:36:47,598 --> 00:36:49,270
Shut up.

329
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:54,954
...bachelor, and party of the first part...

330
00:36:57,797 --> 00:37:03,792
...to ask of you, strictly and formally, here...

331
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:08,875
...Mary Kate Danaher, spinster...

332
00:37:09,757 --> 00:37:12,064
...and party to the second part...

333
00:37:15,956 --> 00:37:19,311
Well?. Go on, you were sayin?

334
00:37:19,515 --> 00:37:25,829
Me mouth is like a dry crust,
and the sun is that hot, and me pate...

335
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:28,503
Would you be steppin into the parlour?

336
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:34,310
The house may belong to my brother,
but whats in the parlour belongs to me.

337
00:37:34,513 --> 00:37:39,906
I will then, and I hope theres a bottle there,
whoever it belongs to.

338
00:37:40,113 --> 00:37:41,910
It could be.

339
00:37:51,152 --> 00:37:54,144
You have a fine, steady hand.

340
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,944
To good bargaining.

341
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,540
To resume:

342
00:38:18,749 --> 00:38:20,899
- The party of the first part...
- Thats him.

343
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:27,422
...has instructed me to enquire
before enterin into formal negotiations...

344
00:38:27,629 --> 00:38:30,824
- ...whether the party to the second part...
- Thats me.

345
00:38:31,027 --> 00:38:37,466
...thinks kindly of the general idea,
or in his own words...American, eh...

346
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:42,498
- ...eh, yes, he wants to know if you go for it.
- Go for it?

347
00:38:42,707 --> 00:38:47,701
- And if you do, hell speak to your brother.
- That wont be easy.

348
00:38:47,907 --> 00:38:49,942
Oh, as well I know it.

349
00:38:50,146 --> 00:38:55,220
Hed as soon put his fist into my teeth
as bid me the time of the day.

350
00:38:56,586 --> 00:39:01,136
What did Sean...the party of the first part,
say about my fortune?

351
00:39:01,345 --> 00:39:04,017
He says he doesnt give it...

352
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:08,980
He says its a matter of
complete indifference to him.

353
00:39:09,184 --> 00:39:13,496
- He did?
- He says he doesnt give a sh...

354
00:39:13,704 --> 00:39:19,972
He says its all one to him if you come
in the clothes on your back, or without them.

355
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,738
Oh, he did, did he? Well.

356
00:39:27,942 --> 00:39:32,732
A fine opinion he must have of me, if he thinks
Id go to any man without a proper fortune.

357
00:39:32,942 --> 00:39:36,218
And this you may tell
your Mr Party of the first part:

358
00:39:36,422 --> 00:39:40,892
When I wed, whatevers my own, goes with me.

359
00:39:41,101 --> 00:39:42,693
Get up, little man.

360
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,056
And all this furniture is mine.

361
00:39:53,259 --> 00:39:57,218
And I have that china, and linen,
and 50 pounds in gold my father left me,

362
00:39:57,419 --> 00:40:02,777
and my mothers rings, brooches,
my grandmothers veil, her silver comb...

363
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:10,217
Thirty pounds odd in notes and silver
Ive earned these past 15 years, thats all.

364
00:40:11,698 --> 00:40:17,168
Youre a well propertied woman.
I wouldnt mind marryin you meself.

365
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,527
Eh, whered you leave the bottle?

366
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:32,049
And Id have you tell him, that Im no pauper
to be going to him in my shift.

367
00:40:43,335 --> 00:40:49,012
# Lo, young May moon is beamin love

368
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:54,765
# The glow of ones lamp is gleamin love

369
00:40:54,973 --> 00:41:00,889
# How sweet to row through Mourners Grove

370
00:41:02,094 --> 00:41:08,691
# While the drowsy world is dreamin...

371
00:41:08,892 --> 00:41:11,645
- You know The Peter And The Ghost.?
- I do not.

372
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:16,447
- Neither do I.
- Could you use a little water in your whiskey?

373
00:41:16,652 --> 00:41:22,886
When I drink whiskey, I drink whiskey,
and when I drink water, I drink water.

374
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:25,924
Back to business now.

375
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:30,646
What answer will I give Sean Thornton,
Mary Kate Danaher?

376
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,320
Well, you can tell him from me that...

377
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:40,568
...that I go for it.

378
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:46,400
# Heres to steal a few hours from the night

379
00:41:47,128 --> 00:41:50,961
# My dear

380
00:42:05,366 --> 00:42:08,040
- How do I look?
- You look fine.

381
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:32,359
- Hey, what do I say?
- Ill do all the talkin.

382
00:42:32,563 --> 00:42:36,954
- And Im suppose to stand here like a dummy?
- Shh, now.

383
00:42:43,003 --> 00:42:47,871
- Will, theres someone coming to call.
- Who?

384
00:42:48,082 --> 00:42:50,312
Its... well...

385
00:42:50,521 --> 00:42:54,753
Its Michaleen Oge Flynn,
and theres a gentleman with him.

386
00:42:57,281 --> 00:42:59,999
Here, Will, put on your coat.

387
00:43:01,361 --> 00:43:04,352
Will Danaher, theyre comin to the front door.

388
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,677
Since when has the back door
been not good enough?

389
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,512
- (MICHALEEN): God bless all in this house.
- (SEAN): Good evening.

390
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:22,916
(MICHALEEN): Miss Danaher,
wed like a word with your brother.

391
00:43:24,558 --> 00:43:27,675
Come on in so, and welcome.

392
00:43:28,558 --> 00:43:31,152
Easy now!

393
00:43:36,877 --> 00:43:43,589
Mr Sean Thornton, bachelor,
meet Miss Mary Kate Danaher, spinster.

394
00:43:44,676 --> 00:43:50,864
Miss Danaher, meet Mr Thornton
from Pittsburgh, Massachusetts, USA.

395
00:43:51,435 --> 00:43:54,394
- Good evening, Miss Danaher.
- This...

396
00:43:56,515 --> 00:43:58,346
This way, please.

397
00:44:08,234 --> 00:44:10,588
- Eh, this is my brother...
- Leave the room.

398
00:44:10,793 --> 00:44:13,910
- But...
- I said, leave the room.

399
00:44:14,113 --> 00:44:18,344
- Yes, Will.
- Sit down, thats what chairs are for.

400
00:44:18,552 --> 00:44:24,149
- If youve come for supper, youre late.
- Gracious invitation, but thank you, no.

401
00:44:25,112 --> 00:44:28,627
I dont suppose theres a drop in the house.

402
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:33,905
- Help yourself to the buttermilk.
- Buttermilk? The Borgias would do better.

403
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:40,061
Well come with your permission
to the object of this visit.

404
00:44:40,271 --> 00:44:47,062
Youve noticed, I presume,
that Im wearin my official black coat.

405
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:50,580
I have. For your dead friend here.

406
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:54,179
(WILL): I need no trouble
to arrange any marriages for me.

407
00:44:54,390 --> 00:45:00,384
I see. Youve been making fine progress
with widow Tillane in the last ten years.

408
00:45:00,588 --> 00:45:02,978
- Is that what youve come to talk about?
- I have not.

409
00:45:03,189 --> 00:45:06,863
- Ive come to talk about your sister and him.
- Aw, get out.

410
00:45:07,068 --> 00:45:10,777
If he was the last man
on the face of the earth, Id still say no.

411
00:45:10,987 --> 00:45:14,741
- Now just a minute.
- If its a question of the girls fortune...

412
00:45:14,947 --> 00:45:19,224
Why, if itd be a shilling piece
he wanted with her...

413
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:22,863
- ...Id still say no.
- Come on, Michaleen. I told you so.

414
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:26,615
- Ill explain it to her myself.
- Hey, Yank, Ill count three.

415
00:45:26,826 --> 00:45:29,943
If youre not out of the house by then,
Ill loose the dogs on you.

416
00:45:30,146 --> 00:45:35,504
If you say three,
youll never hear the man count ten.

417
00:45:47,584 --> 00:45:53,055
- Oh, Mary Kate, we tried.
- Well see him again some other time.

418
00:45:57,023 --> 00:46:00,776
I thank you anyway,
Sean Thornton, for the asking.

419
00:46:00,982 --> 00:46:06,102
You dont think this changes anything?
Its what you say that counts, not him.

420
00:46:06,302 --> 00:46:08,657
Now, now, Sean.
Youve gone too far, thats enough.

421
00:46:08,862 --> 00:46:13,458
Say, what is this?
Were gonna get married, arent we?

422
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,535
- I dont get it.
- This is Ireland, Sean, not America.

423
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:33,894
Without her brothers consent she couldnt,
and wouldnt. Im sorry for both of you.

424
00:47:07,456 --> 00:47:13,564
Those were the bad days. Sean with a face
as dark as the black hunter he rode.

425
00:47:13,777 --> 00:47:16,050
A fine, ill-tempered pair they were.

426
00:47:16,255 --> 00:47:18,974
It was only a matter of time
before one or the other broke his neck.

427
00:47:19,175 --> 00:47:21,484
We knew things couldnt go on this way.

428
00:47:28,934 --> 00:47:31,686
Easy, Sean!

429
00:47:42,414 --> 00:47:45,484
Hello, Mary Kate...Danaher.

430
00:47:46,373 --> 00:47:49,887
Good morning, Sean Thornton.

431
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,079
So, we formed a little conspiracy.

432
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:07,968
The Reverend Mr and Mrs Playfair,
Michaleen Oge and, saints forgive us, myself.

433
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:14,288
And on the day of the Inisfree Races,
we sprung the trap on Red Will Danaher.

434
00:48:51,405 --> 00:48:54,158
Remember, you make your speed
when you hit the water.

435
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:57,595
- Yes, father.
- And ride carefully, my son.

436
00:48:57,804 --> 00:48:59,203
Yes, mum.

437
00:48:59,404 --> 00:49:01,396
Thornton, no silks.

438
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,072
- Your colours, Thornton.
- Thank you.

439
00:49:24,602 --> 00:49:26,593
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

440
00:49:34,601 --> 00:49:39,594
Ladies, gentlemen, your attention, please!

441
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,873
Will all the lovely ladies,

442
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:47,756
who are putting up their bonnets
for the Inisfree Cup,

443
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:52,191
please place their bonnets on the finishing line.

444
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:56,228
Ladies, your bonnets, please!

445
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,991
- Will you not be putting up your bonnet?
- Indeed, I will not.

446
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:03,428
- No?
- No!

447
00:50:13,437 --> 00:50:16,315
Okay, Michaleen, the widows bonnet.

448
00:50:16,517 --> 00:50:22,831
Will all the gentlemen riders
please go to the starting line.

449
00:50:23,517 --> 00:50:26,154
All riders, please.

450
00:50:26,355 --> 00:50:32,794
Crown at 20 to 1 on the Yank.
Im given 20 to 1 on the Yank...

451
00:50:33,955 --> 00:50:39,234
- Im given 30 to 1...40 to 1 on Danaher.
- Flynn!

452
00:50:40,434 --> 00:50:45,827
If youve done any matchmaking between
Thornton and my widow, Ill put you in me pocket.

453
00:50:46,034 --> 00:50:51,585
- Ah, so youve heard?
- Father, what sort of a scoundrel is this Yank?

454
00:50:51,793 --> 00:50:54,785
One minute its me sister,
and the next its herself.

455
00:50:54,993 --> 00:50:56,950
Well, blame no one but yourself.

456
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:01,510
If youd saved me as your matchmaker,
you wouldve been married long since.

457
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:05,625
- True, Will, true.
- Im not saying its too late yet.

458
00:51:05,832 --> 00:51:11,428
- What do you mean?
- Why has the widow stood you up so long?

459
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:13,906
- Youre a fine looking man.
- I am.

460
00:51:14,111 --> 00:51:17,546
- A rich, propertied man.
- And well she knows it.

461
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:21,982
- Father, will I tell him?
- Go ahead, Michaleen.

462
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:25,739
What woman would come into a house
with another woman in it?

463
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:30,546
If you got rid of Mary Kate,
the widow would be in like a shot.

464
00:51:30,749 --> 00:51:34,868
- No.
- Yes. You had your chance and you flubbed it.

465
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:38,698
You refused Seaneen Thornton,
and he reneged on you.

466
00:51:38,909 --> 00:51:44,698
Now, I doubt if hed take your sister
if you put 1000 pounds on her.

467
00:51:44,907 --> 00:51:49,298
- Father Lonergan?
- I cant say its true, and I wont say its not.

468
00:51:49,507 --> 00:51:53,183
- But theres been talk.
- Oh, a lot of talk.

469
00:51:53,387 --> 00:51:55,298
A lot of talk, eh?

470
00:51:55,507 --> 00:51:59,055
Two women in the house,
and one of them a redhead.

471
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:03,819
Two women.

472
00:52:09,706 --> 00:52:13,414
Three Our Fathers, and three Hail Marys.

473
00:52:19,664 --> 00:52:23,179
Morning, Mary Kate. Morning, children.

474
00:52:41,942 --> 00:52:44,581
Dont sit there gawking.
Youre gonna put up your bonnet.

475
00:52:44,782 --> 00:52:46,818
- I will do no such shameless thing.
- You will.

476
00:52:47,022 --> 00:52:49,694
I will not!

477
00:53:15,019 --> 00:53:18,328
No bonnet, Mary Kate? What a pity.

478
00:53:49,176 --> 00:53:51,484
Betting will now stop,

479
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:57,133
and the sale of all intoxicating
and alcoholic drinks will cease. I mean it now!

480
00:54:01,734 --> 00:54:06,330
Oh, Sergeant Major, in your good time, please.

481
00:54:23,492 --> 00:54:25,642
The Yanks holdin back.

482
00:55:16,887 --> 00:55:18,638
Foul!

483
00:55:37,405 --> 00:55:44,082
- Look at that crazy Danaher!

01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,840
Well, get it then.

649
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:50,950
There will be no locks or bolts between us,
except those in your own mercenary little heart.

650
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:30,820
(LAUGHTER AND MUSIC FROM OUTSIDE)

651
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:50,700
- Sean. - Howd you sleep?

652
01:21:52,190 --> 01:21:55,420
Dont be shamin me, please, in front of your friends.

653
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:59,260
What...? Oh, okay.

654
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:06,390
# (MEN).: There that I learned all me courtin

655
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:10,270
# Many lessons I took in the art

656
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:14,100
# The Cupid, the blagger, while sportin

657
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:19,910
# An arrow drove straight through me mush, mush, |mush, toor-i-li-anny

658

# Me mush, mush, mush, toor-i-li-ay

659
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:28,950
# So I lathered him with me shillelagh

660
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:34,100
# For he trod on the tail o me mush, mush, mush, toor-i-li-anny

661
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:38,620

# For, he trod on the tail of me coat

664
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:57,670
Hello, the house! Anyone up?

665
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:03,420
- Good mornin! - Good mornin.

666
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:10,500
I...I suppose its a bit early to be callin.

667
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:17,260
After you left last night, Mary Kate,
a couple of us persuaded Danaher to change his mind.

668
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:22,250
Its a...what might be called a sort of
a belated wedding present.

669
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:29,610
My things... My furniture!

670
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:35,980
Wed brought them over last night, |but due to the circumstances...

671
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:38,820
Thanks, thanks.

672
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:45,450
- Okay, easy now. - God bless all here.

673
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:50,900
Thats right. Oh, be careful. Over there by the wall.

674
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:59,180
No, no, no. Turn it around, so that |the light shines on the music.

675
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:08,010
- Thats grand. Thats grand now. |- Where do you want this?

676
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:15,770
- Mighty handy. - It...

677
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:19,130
It was my mothers, and my mothers mothers before.

678
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:25,130
- Where do I put it? - Where do you suppose?

679
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:28,090
(MICHALEEN): Where do you suppose...

680
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:36,690
- Were sorry about the dowry, Mary Kate.
- We couldnt get him to change his mind.

681
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:40,450
- Not even Father Lonergan could do it.
- (SEAN): Let him keep it.

682
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:44,250
- Keep my fortune? |- Youve got your tables and chairs.

683
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:46,690
- What do we care about his money? |- My money.

684
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:50,010
Let him have it if it means that much to him.

685
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:59,930
- What manner of man is it that Ive married?
- A better one, I think, that you know.

686
01:25:17,010 --> 01:25:20,720
Impetuous! Homeric!

687
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:30,090
(MARYKATE).: #Oh, Inisfree

688
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:36,480

# To my own dear island

692
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:05,200
# Ill rest awhile

693

# Bromwell Creek

695
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:07,990
Now I know why you have so many rock walls in this country.

696
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,960
(MARY KATE): Roses! Are you plantin roses?

697
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,670
- Yeah. - A fine farmer you are.

698
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:19,110
- Not a turnip, or a potato in the field. - Or children.

699
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,790
(ROOSTER CROWS)

700
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,600
Sorry.

701
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:41,790
Well, I...I suppose theyll make a very fine |display around the cottage.

702
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,390
- It is a pretty cottage, isnt it? - I think so.

703
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,390
Lets see now.

704
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:08,310
We need a plough, and a cultivator, |and seed for planting.

705
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:11,950
About a horse for the ploughing... |We could sell that hunter of yours.

706
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:16,710
Ill buy another horse for the ploughing. |Why not a tractor?

707
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:22,670
Oh, a tractor... Nasty, smelly things. |Besides, theyre an awful price.

708
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:27,820
- With a horse, you get other advantages. |- Yeah. For the roses.

709
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,630
Roses, again.

710
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:34,630
You...

711
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:41,540
We could do our shopping in Castletown,

712
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:45,300
and if we put a good foot under us, |wed be back by suppertime.

713
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:47,950
- Five miles! - Well, thats just a...

714
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:50,910
Good stretch of the legs, huh?

715
01:28:53,110 --> 01:28:56,390
All right, get on your walking shoes.

716
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:03,940
Ill be a minute.

01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:32,540
So, youre not a woman to be honked at, ha?

720
01:29:33,230 --> 01:29:36,780
Why, its beautiful! Did you ever see...

721
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:41,220
- It looks like it could fly.
- Only one horsepower, but its all yours.

722
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:45,100
- Mine? - Sure. Think you can drive it?

723
01:29:45,310 --> 01:29:47,660
Hold on to your hat!

724
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:55,540
(RED WILL): You take care of that, Feeney.

725
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:06,730
- Lets have another pint. Im buying this one. |- High time.

726
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:10,220
- Whats that? - I said, thats fine, squire.

727
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:13,970
Good health to you all.

728
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:19,250
- Look, he sold the crossbreds. - The what?

729
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:21,330
- The sheep hes been planning on. - Oh.

730
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:25,050
Hurry, now is a good time to ask him. Well, go on.

731
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:28,340
- Ask him what? - About my money.

732
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:30,410
He cant say that he hasnt got it with him now.

733
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:34,450
Cant you understand that |I didnt marry you for your fortune?

734
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:40,330
- I dont give... a hang about the money.
- But he does! Thats the whole point of it.

735
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:45,170
- Now will you go and ask him? |- No. Why shame ourselves?

736
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:51,250
Shame? The shames on you, not on me.
Or on me too, if I married a coward.

737
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:54,730
Is that what you think of me?

738
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:57,320
What else if you let him rob you out of my money?

739
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:03,360
Money! Im sick of the talk of it.
Is that all you Danahers think about? Money?

740
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:40,880
(FATHER): Quiet! Hes just behind that rock.

741
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:44,280
- This is very important... |- Oh, salmon! Hes winking at me.

742
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:46,720
Ive been trying to catch this one for ten years.

743
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:50,920
Ive got to talk to you about my husband and myself.

744
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,190
There he is.

but here a married man sleeps in a bed, not a bag,

755
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:04,430
and for your own good... Help, help, there he is!

756
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,480
- Ive been waiting for this for 10 years! |- Keep his head up.

- Theres that beauty, that...
- Keep his head up. Keep a tight line.

- Maybe theyll do it again. |- Im not askin anybody to do my fightin for me.

783
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:13,490
I do. I just want to hear you ask for it.

784
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:17,130
Just ask for it, Yank.

785
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:21,220
- Youve got 20 pounds on him. |- And so I have.

786

What if I put one of me fists in me pocket? |Right or left? You choose, go on.

- It was Mr Thornton, so I brought him in.|- Bless my soul. Sit down.

01:39:09,730 --> 01:39:11,770
- Have you tiddled your last wink? |- I have.

792
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:14,120
- No cheating? - I have not.

793
01:39:14,810 --> 01:39:19,410
- Do you play tiddly-winks? - No, I...

794
01:39:19,610 --> 01:39:25,130
- Maybe I shouldnt have butted in like this...|- Nonsense. How is your lovely bride?

795
01:39:25,330 --> 01:39:29,090
- Fine. - Elizabeth, say good night to Mr Thornton.

796
01:39:29,290 --> 01:39:34,810
But hes only just come...oh. Very well. |Good night, Mr Thornton.

Good night, Elizabeth. Pleasant dreams.

Yes, I was reading about it again this evening.

Its a very understandable reaction.

810
01:40:26,890 --> 01:40:32,080
The papers all say it was an accident. |Just one of those things.

811
01:40:32,290 --> 01:40:38,120
Its just one of those things in a scrapbook, |but when you carry it around in here...

I didnt go in there to outbox him. |I went there to beat his brains out.

815
01:40:55,800 --> 01:41:00,350
To drive him into the canvas, to murder him. |Thats what I did.

816
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,840
For what? Purse, a piece of the gate.

817
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,560
Lousy money.

818
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,280
And now money is behind your trouble with Danaher.

819
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:18,920
They think Im afraid of fighting. |All the friends Ive made, even my wife.

820
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:23,480
- Well, arent you in a way? |- Did you ever kill a man?

821
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:30,160
Well, I have, and all this talk about her big fortune...

822
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:33,510
Its not that important.

823
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,950
Perhaps it is to her.

824
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:42,760
It must be strange to you from America,

825
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,430
but its an old, old custom here, and believe me, |its a good custom.

826
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:50,520
The fortune means more to her than just the money.

827
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:54,600
Not to me, it isnt. Not worth fighting for.

828
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:58,510
- Is your wifes love worth fighting for? |- I dont know.

829
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:07,190
All I know is that...I wont fight, |unless Im mad enough to kill,

830
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:11,110
and if that means losin her...I dont know.

831
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:16,270
- Maybe she doesnt love me enough. |- Its a difficult situation.

832
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:21,190
I think youll find the right answer in Gods good time.

833
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:24,830
And when that time comes, I hope Im still here.

834
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:28,950
- Youre not leaving, are you? |- Its a possibility.

835
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:32,860
My bishop is coming tomorrow on his annual visit,

836
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:38,390
and Ive got such a small congregation, |just 2-3 people at the service.

837
01:42:38,590 --> 01:42:43,710
- He may transfer me.|- The place wouldnt be the same without you.

838
01:42:44,630 --> 01:42:50,260
Elizabeth and I just love this place. |We were born here too, you know.

839
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:54,710
The bishops a good egg, maybe itll be all right.

840
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:59,590
Oh, by the way. Dont underestimate Danaher.

841
01:42:59,790 --> 01:43:04,100
He may be clumsy, but hes got |a tremendous right and a jaw of granite.

842
01:43:06,910 --> 01:43:10,460
I did a little bit of boxing in my time.

843
01:43:20,030 --> 01:43:22,420
You wont be laughin now, will you?

844
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:27,340
It was at Trinity.

845
01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:30,780
Lightweight champion, 19...

846
01:43:30,990 --> 01:43:34,950
The year doesnt matter. It was long, long ago.

847
01:43:37,790 --> 01:43:40,510
All right.

848
01:43:41,110 --> 01:43:43,860
By the way, would you join me in a glass of...

849
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:47,020
Oh, no.

850
01:43:48,350 --> 01:43:52,310
No. Youll be in training now, of course.

851
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:06,530
- (MARY KATE): Did you have any supper? - No.

852
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:08,860
(SEAN): Im not hungry.

853
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:14,090
- The drink sometimes does that to a man. |- I havent had anything to drink.

854
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:19,330
(SEAN): If you wanna know, I was talking to the vicar.

855
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:24,740
- Mr Playfair. - Thats strange.

856
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:34,130
I had a long talk with Father Lonergan.

857
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:40,240
Woman of the house! Wheres me tea?

858
01:46:44,050 --> 01:46:45,530
Mary Kate?

859
01:46:45,730 --> 01:46:51,970
(MICHALEEN): Save your breath, boy. |Shes gone from you, and small wonder.

860
01:46:52,170 --> 01:46:57,720
- What are you talking about? Where is she? |- She came tappin at me door.

861
01:46:57,930 --> 01:47:01,200
- Will you join me to the train, says she. - Why?

862
01:47:01,410 --> 01:47:06,690
The very question. Why, says I. |Because I love him, says she.

863
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:10,440
I love him too much to go on livin |with a man Im ashamed of.

864
01:47:12,130 --> 01:47:16,840
- What time was this? - Time for the Dublin train.

865
01:47:29,810 --> 01:47:32,120
Saddle up my horse, will you, please.

866
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:35,240
Saddle his horse?

867
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:41,240
Ill have no part in helpin |you to put more shame on her.

868
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:45,160
Saddle his horse...

869
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:51,720
Dam da dam da, diddle de da...

870
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:22,200
Well, were off!

871
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:27,110
Then, might I suggest that the train already |is four and a half hours late.

872
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:30,070
Now, is it my fault?

873
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:34,520
Theres a match at Ballygar, and the champions of all Ireland...

874
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:39,320
If you knew your countrys history as well as |you claim to know it,

875
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:45,120
youd know that they havent been beaten |west of the Shannon for the last 22 years.

876
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:48,520
- True! - Its a lie!

877
01:49:56,430 --> 01:49:59,070
If this means what I hope it means...

878
01:49:59,270 --> 01:50:03,350
Danaher versus the Yank. |Itll be weeks on the green this time.

879
01:50:11,910 --> 01:50:13,420
Morning.

880
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:24,260
Good day to you, sir.

881
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:41,340
Five minutes, did you say? Right!

882
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:48,940
- Hes walkin her back, the whole long way! |- Its Homeric, thats what it is, Homeric.

883
01:50:49,150 --> 01:50:52,780
- Post a lookout. They may go home first. |- Wheres your pistol?.

884
01:50:52,990 --> 01:50:55,940
- In the same place. - Excuse me, general.

885
01:50:57,230 --> 01:51:02,220
One by land, two by sea, and Ill follow the lot.

886
01:51:02,430 --> 01:51:04,020
What a day for Inisfree!

887
01:51:04,230 --> 01:51:09,540
On a day like this I can say only one thing. |Gentlemen, the drinks are on the house!

888
01:51:12,620 --> 01:51:14,580
Well, they are.

889
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:49,660
(WOMAN): Darling, here is your shoe!

890
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:55,700
Why, you...

891
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:04,210
Its only five miles. Just a good stretch of the legs.

892
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:12,930
- You lost your shoe. - Thank you very kindly, sir.

893
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:44,730
(WOMAN): Mr... Mr Sean! Heres |a good stick to beat the lovely lady.

894
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:48,210
Thanks!

895
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:52,330
(GUNSHOTS FROM OUTSIDE)

896
01:53:49,010 --> 01:53:53,720
I think your in-laws are comin |to visit you, Squire Danaher.

897
01:54:30,730 --> 01:54:36,080
Danaher, you owe me 350 pounds. Lets have it.

898
01:54:45,210 --> 01:54:47,560
So, the IRA is in this, too, eh?

899
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:53,240
If it were, Will Danaher, not |a stone of your fine housed be standin.

900
01:54:53,450 --> 01:54:56,160
A beautiful sentiment.

901
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:02,480
Ill pay you...never.

902
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:05,910
That breaks all bargains.

903
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:11,470
(SEAN): You can take your sister back. |Its your custom, not mine.

904
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:15,230
(SEAN): No fortune, no marriage. We call it quits.

905
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:24,160
Youd do this to me, your own wife?

906
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:27,240
- After what... - (SEAN): Its done.

907
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,150
Theres your dirty money. Take it.

908
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:42,670
Count it, you spawn, and look.

909
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:47,030
If ever I see that face of yours again, |Ill push that through it.

910
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:06,630
Charge it!

911
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:14,350
Ill be goin on home now. |Ill have the supper ready for you.

912
01:56:53,470 --> 01:56:55,670
All right, Will, you asked for it.

913
01:57:08,350 --> 01:57:11,900
Three to one given on Danaher. Three to one...

914
01:57:12,110 --> 01:57:17,060
- Ill have some of that. Ten on Thornton. |- Done! Anyone else?

915
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:15,420
(MICHALEEN): Gentlemen, if you please. |This is a private fight.

916
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:19,900
The Marquis of Queensbury rules |will be observed on all occasions.

917
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:22,740
Mind your nose, squire.

918
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:26,180
Okay with me, Michaleen!

919
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:31,420
Thanks.

920
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:35,660
Non-belligerents will kindly remain neutral.

921
01:58:35,860 --> 01:58:39,700
Now, shake hands and come out fighting. I thank you.

922
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:43,370
Did you hear that, everybody? |The Marquis of Queensbury rules.

923
01:58:43,580 --> 01:58:45,780
- The Marquis of Queensbury rules. - Mar..

924
01:58:51,180 --> 01:58:54,220
Come on, get up, Marquis of Queensbury.

925
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:58,860
- I hope that Thornton beats him senseless. |- Hes a married man, Sarah.

926
01:58:59,060 --> 01:59:02,940
Who cares about him? Its that big bully concerns me.

927
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:06,260
Im the best man in Inisfree. |As if I didnt know that.

928
01:59:11,020 --> 01:59:15,010
Call them and tell them to send reinforcements. |Theres a riot here.

929
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:33,170
Five to one on the big chap, Snuffy.

930
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:36,810
- Given or taken? - Given.

931
01:59:50,340 --> 01:59:53,050
- Youve had enough? - No.

932
01:59:58,090 --> 02:00:00,890
Well, give a man a hand, then.

933
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:10,720
Yes, inspector. Thank you, sir.

934
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:14,050
- What did he say? - To put five pounds on Danahers nose.

935
02:00:15,050 --> 02:00:18,810
- Another ten on Thornton! - Another.

936
02:00:20,250 --> 02:00:25,410
- A pound on Danaher. - Two pounds on Danaher, please.

937
02:00:25,610 --> 02:00:28,210
Two pounds?

938
02:00:28,410 --> 02:00:32,170
...hands of a hundred battles, |eye on a thousand besides...

939
02:00:32,370 --> 02:00:35,650
...stood alone on the victorious field, |his buckler bent...

940
02:00:35,850 --> 02:00:38,840
...his broken sword clutched in his mighty hand...

941
02:00:39,050 --> 02:00:45,050
...the blood of a thousand wounds |oozing from his open veins...

942
02:00:45,250 --> 02:00:47,610
(NOISE OUTSIDE)

943
02:01:11,850 --> 02:01:15,520
- Father! Father Lonergan! - Shh, shhh.

944
02:01:15,730 --> 02:01:19,240
- A big fight in the town! |- And in this fish right here.

945
02:01:19,450 --> 02:01:23,040
- Id put a stop to it but... |- You do that. Its your duty.

946
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:26,360
But you see, it was Danaher and Sean Thornton!

947
02:01:26,570 --> 02:01:29,320
- Who? - Danaher and Sean Thornton.

948
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:32,040
Why the devil didnt you tell me?

949
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:52,880
- Shouldnt we put a stop to it? |- We should, lad, we should.

950
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:56,320
Its our duty, yes, its our duty.

951
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:06,600
Come on, come on!

952
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:17,440
- Hows that bettin going? |- Even money, but dont ruin it.

953
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:23,510
Well, Danaher, youre a good fight, |Ill say that for you.

954
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:28,000
When it comes to that, its been a pleasure beatin you.

955
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:37,080
Thanks.

956
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:42,510
- Will you take another 20 on Thornton? |- No, the books closed.

957
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:48,670
- A pound on Thornton against the squire. |- Go away!

958
02:02:50,920 --> 02:02:54,150
- How about a drink? |- The drink will be on the house.

959
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:59,350
Thats a good idea. The people of Ballyglon are comin |over by bus, thousands of them.

960
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:03,390
Thats a good idea, not that Im tired. |Im as fresh as a daisy.

961
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:06,870
You look more like a black-eyed Susan to me. Lets go.

962
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:11,200
- Is that a public house? |- Yes, your lordship.

963
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:13,390
- Are they going in? - Yes, your lordship.

964
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:18,750
- Does that mean that the fights over? |- No, thats just the end of round one.

965
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:23,430
Come, keep away, keep away!

966
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:36,700
Whiskey? No, thatll be too warm, |itll get your blood up. Porter is the very thing.

967
02:03:36,910 --> 02:03:41,270
- Ah, its peaceful and quiet in here, isnt it? |- Yeah.

968
02:03:41,470 --> 02:03:43,150
You know...

969
02:03:45,910 --> 02:03:48,380
This has been a fight Id come a long way to see.

970
02:03:48,590 --> 02:03:51,190
I hope you can stick around for the finish.

971
02:03:52,590 --> 02:03:55,230
Dont worry about that!

972
02:03:58,470 --> 02:04:04,150
- You know, Yank. Ive taken quite a likin to you. |- Im gettin real fond of you, too.

973
02:04:05,110 --> 02:04:09,310
Your widow, me sister... She couldve done a lot worse.

974
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:11,500
- True, true. - Poor woman.

975
02:04:11,710 --> 02:04:15,390
- Thanks, fill them up again. |- You buy me no drinks.

976
02:04:15,590 --> 02:04:20,060
- The drinks are on the house, sir. |- Im takin no drinks from you, squint.

977
02:04:20,270 --> 02:04:24,310
- Im buyin the drinks. |- You can buy me a drink at your wake.

978
02:04:24,510 --> 02:04:26,470
