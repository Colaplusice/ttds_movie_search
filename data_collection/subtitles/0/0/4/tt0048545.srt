1
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,260
Get up, get up!

2
00:01:51,806 --> 00:01:53,892
Mixed up in that beating on 12th Street?

3
00:01:53,975 --> 00:01:55,268
No, plain drunkenness.

4
00:01:55,477 --> 00:01:57,020
It says he was picked up there.

5
00:01:57,103 --> 00:01:59,564
They had him on the carpet
down at headquarters.

6
00:01:59,772 --> 00:02:01,774
He's clear. Plain drunkenness.

7
00:02:01,983 --> 00:02:02,984
All right.

8
00:02:03,484 --> 00:02:04,444
Fill it up.

9
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:05,778
Can I keep it?

10
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:09,532
Okay. You want to lean him
against something?

11
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:12,326
- Stand him over there.
- Come on.

12
00:02:30,427 --> 00:02:31,428
Judy?

13
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:33,555
We're ready for you now.

14
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:52,866
He must hate me.

15
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:54,075
What?

16
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:57,996
He hates me.

17
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:00,874
What makes you think so?

18
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,377
I don't think. I know.

19
00:03:06,212 --> 00:03:07,714
He looks at me like...

20
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:10,883
I was the ugliest thing in the world.

21
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:13,720
He doesn't like my friends.

22
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:16,222
He doesn't like one thing about me.

23
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:18,808
And he called me...

24
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:23,646
He called me a dirty tramp!

25
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,732
My own father!

26
00:03:28,526 --> 00:03:30,361
Do you think he really means that?

27
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,029
Yes!

28
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,572
No!

29
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:35,991
I don't know.

30
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:43,123
I mean, maybe he doesn't mean it...

31
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:45,584
but he acts like he does.

32
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,587
We were all together.

33
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,757
And we were going to celebrate Easter.

34
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:55,427
And we were going to catch a double bill.

35
00:03:57,262 --> 00:03:58,597
Big deal!

36
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:01,933
So I put on my new dress...

37
00:04:03,268 --> 00:04:04,936
and I came out...

38
00:04:05,937 --> 00:04:07,939
and he grabbed my face...

39
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,985
and he started rubbing off all the lipstick.

40
00:04:15,446 --> 00:04:17,782
I thought he'd rub off my lips.

41
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,119
And I ran out of that house.

42
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:23,955
Is that why you were
wandering around at 1:00 a. m.?

43
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,085
Not looking for company?

44
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:33,631
I don't even know why I do it.

45
00:04:34,131 --> 00:04:36,300
Maybe you get back at your dad that way.

46
00:04:36,383 --> 00:04:39,303
If you're not as close to him
as you'd like to be...

47
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,931
maybe this is one way
of making him pay attention.

48
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,433
Did you think of that?

49
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:48,687
I'll never get close to anybody.

50
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,732
Would you go home if we can arrange it?

51
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:59,364
What's your number, Judy?

52
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,242
We'll ask your dad
to come and pick you up.

53
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:04,953
Unless you really don't want to go home.

54
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:08,164
Would you rather stay here?

55
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:19,342
Lexington 0-5-5-4-9.

56
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:37,401
That's enough static out of you!

57
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:47,953
Cut it out now. I'm warning you!

58
00:05:51,832 --> 00:05:54,877
You're shivering, John. Are you cold?

59
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,758
Want my jacket?

60
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:10,809
Want my jacket?

61
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:12,561
It's warm.

62
00:06:28,076 --> 00:06:29,786
Your mother will pick you up.

63
00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:30,912
What?

64
00:06:31,245 --> 00:06:33,498
Your mother will be down to pick you up.

65
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:35,041
My mother!

66
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,001
She's being called for.

67
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:40,588
You said you'd call my father!

68
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:43,549
Goodbye, Judy. And take it easy.

69
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:45,384
Oh, sure!

70
00:06:58,522 --> 00:06:59,481
John Crawford?

71
00:06:59,565 --> 00:07:00,566
Yes, sir?

72
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:02,442
Come with me, John.

73
00:07:12,244 --> 00:07:13,328
Jim!

74
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:23,004
Happy Easter.

75
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,298
Happy Easter.

76
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:27,425
Where were you tonight?

77
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:30,094
They called us,
and I got the fright of my life!

78
00:07:30,178 --> 00:07:32,222
Where were you tonight, Jimbo?

79
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:44,066
Well, then, there now.

80
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:47,320
Were you having a ball, Dad?

81
00:07:49,655 --> 00:07:52,158
Well, everybody's been having a ball.

82
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:58,539
You're the king of the ball, Dad.

83
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:08,382
You think I'm funny?

84
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:25,273
Why didn't you take my jacket?

85
00:08:25,982 --> 00:08:27,233
Jim Stark?

86
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:38,286
John.

87
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:41,456
John!

88
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:47,503
Do you have any idea
why you shot those puppies?

89
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:51,883
Is that what they call you,
or do you have a nickname?

90
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:53,718
Plato.

91
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:55,886
He was a Greek philosopher.

92
00:08:56,971 --> 00:09:00,808
You talk nice to the man now, hear?
He's going to help you.

93
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:04,019
Nobody can help me.

94
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,730
Can you tell me why
you killed those puppies?

95
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,525
No, sir.

96
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,695
Where'd you get the gun?

97
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:16,490
My mother's drawer.

98
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:19,368
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?

99
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,078
She's away.

100
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,538
She's always going away somewhere.

101
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:27,083
She's got a sister in Chicago,
and she's there for the holiday.

102
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:28,752
Where's your father?

103
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,587
They're not together, sir.

104
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,590
We haven't seen him now in a long time.

105
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,259
Do you ever hear from him?

106
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:39,971
I don't think it's right for a mother
to go and leave her child.

107
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,140
It's his birthday today, sir.

108
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:46,603
Did the boy ever talk to a psychiatrist?

109
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:49,981
You mean a head shrinker?

110
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,443
Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them, sir.

111
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:56,195
Maybe she'd better start.

112
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:58,573
Sit over there for just a minute, please.

113
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:08,123
I don't see what's so bad
about taking a little drink.

114
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,792
You don't?

115
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,126
He's a minor...

116
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:14,088
and it looks like he had more
than a "little drink. "

117
00:10:14,963 --> 00:10:16,382
Don't hum, dear.

118
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,676
I cut loose pretty good in my day too.

119
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:20,969
Really, Frank?

120
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:22,429
When was that?

121
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:24,556
Can't you wait till we get home?

122
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:25,807
How about you?

123
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,934
Got anything to say for yourself?

124
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:30,604
Not interested?

125
00:10:31,146 --> 00:10:32,814
Can't you answer?

126
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:34,441
What's the matter with you?

127
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:36,193
He's just loaded, honey.

128
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:38,528
I was talking to Jim!

129
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,741
Well, I'd like to just explain.
You see, we just moved here...

130
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:45,618
and the kid hasn't got any friends.

131
00:10:45,827 --> 00:10:47,328
Tell him why we moved here.

132
00:10:47,495 --> 00:10:48,788
Will you hold it?

133
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:50,498
Tell the man why we moved.

134
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:52,834
- Will you hold it!
- You can't protect me.

135
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:57,588
Do you mind if I try? Do you
have to slam the door in my face?

136
00:10:58,214 --> 00:11:01,259
I try to get to him. What happens?

137
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:04,595
I buy you everything you want.
A bicycle? You get it!

138
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:06,931
- A car...
- You buy me many things.

139
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,266
Not just buying!

140
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:11,560
We give you love and affection, don't we?

141
00:11:11,644 --> 00:11:12,978
Then what is it?

142
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:15,147
Was it because we went to that party?

143
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:19,360
You know what kind of drunken brawls
those kind of parties turn into.

144
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:20,986
It's no place for kids!

145
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,781
A minute ago,
you said you didn't care if he drinks.

146
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:25,866
He said a "little" drink.

147
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:29,203
You're tearing me apart!

148
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:34,708
You say one thing, he says another,
and everybody changes back again!

149
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,960
That's a fine way to behave!

150
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:39,546
Well, you know who he takes after.

151
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:47,345
Inside, Jim.

152
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:49,931
Come on.

153
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,391
Inside.

154
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,978
- Excuse us a minute.
- Yeah, sure.

155
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:04,070
Somebody ought to put poison
in her Epsom salts.

156
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:05,738
Grandma?

157
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,074
Get lost.

158
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:11,077
Hang loose, boy. I'm warning you.

159
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:15,998
Why don't you wash up and go home?

160
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:18,084
This is cute.

161
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:21,086
Big, tough character!

162
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:23,589
You don't kid me, pal.

163
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:26,383
How come you're not wearing your boots?

164
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,720
Well, that's cute.

165
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:33,432
That's cute.

166
00:12:47,946 --> 00:12:49,948
It's too bad you didn't connect.

167
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:53,785
You could have gone to juvenile hall.

168
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:56,955
That's what you want, isn't it?

169
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:00,834
Sure, it is.

170
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:05,630
You want to bug us
till we have to lock you up.

171
00:13:06,297 --> 00:13:07,173
Why?

172
00:13:07,382 --> 00:13:09,008
- Leave me alone.
- No.

173
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:12,261
I don't know why.

174
00:13:12,345 --> 00:13:14,055
Go on, don't give me that!

175
00:13:14,472 --> 00:13:18,476
Please, lock me up. I'll hit somebody.
I'll do something, and I don't...

176
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:22,188
Try the desk.

177
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:27,318
Go ahead.

178
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:07,857
Is that why you moved?
You were in trouble?

179
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,777
No, they think...

180
00:14:12,737 --> 00:14:16,032
that they can protect me
by moving around all the time.

181
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:20,328
You had a good start in the wrong
direction. Why'd you do it?

182
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:23,205
What do you mean?

183
00:14:24,206 --> 00:14:25,750
Mess a kid up?

184
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:32,381
He called me chicken.

185
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:35,634
Your folks didn't understand?

186
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:39,263
They never do.

187
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:46,728
They think that I can make friends...

188
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:48,897
if we move.

189
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:56,780
Just move. Everything
will be roses and sunshine.

190
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:59,574
But you don't think
that's the right solution?

191
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,872
She eats him alive and he takes it.

192
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:08,249
Things pretty rough for you at home?

193
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:11,085
That's a zoo!

194
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:12,587
What?

195
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,590
That's a zoo!

196
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:20,803
I mean, he always wants to be my pal,
you know?

197
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:25,475
But how can I give him anything if he's...

198
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:32,064
I mean, I love him and all that type of stuff.

199
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,818
I don't want to hurt him.

200
00:15:36,444 --> 00:15:39,905
But then I don't know what to do anymore.

201
00:15:40,114 --> 00:15:42,408
Except maybe die.

202
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:46,453
If he had guts to knock Mom cold once...

203
00:15:46,704 --> 00:15:49,957
then maybe she'd be happy
and she'd stop picking on him.

204
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,168
Because they make mush out of him!

205
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:56,838
You know, just mush!

206
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:03,637
I'll tell you one thing,
I don't ever want to be like him.

207
00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:05,388
Chicken?

208
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:08,850
I'll bet you see right through me,
don't you?

209
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:16,316
How can a guy grow up
in a circus like that?

210
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:18,151
Beats me, Jim.

211
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:20,737
But they do.

212
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:22,405
Want some water?

213
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:31,164
If I had one day...

214
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:38,921
when I didn't have to be all confused...

215
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:44,385
and I didn't have to feel
that I was ashamed of everything...

216
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:47,596
If I felt that I belonged someplace...

217
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:49,640
You know? Then...

218
00:16:55,604 --> 00:16:57,523
Will you do something for me?

219
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:04,655
If the pot starts boiling again,
will you see me before you get in a jam?

220
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:08,825
If you want to talk,
come in and shoot the breeze.

221
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:12,204
It's easier sometimes
than talking to your folks.

222
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:18,960
Anytime, night or day.

223
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:30,305
You calmed down enough
to go back in there now?

224
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:34,559
Are you serious?

225
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,734
Mother, I'm sorry.

226
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:45,778
It's all right, darling.

227
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:47,405
Mister Officer...

228
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:49,740
this was all very unfortunate.

229
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:53,744
He made a mistake, and he's sorry,
so we won't have any more trouble.

230
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:56,455
He was always a lovely boy.

231
00:17:56,664 --> 00:18:00,250
Grandmother, you tell one more lie
and you'll turn to stone.

232
00:18:03,837 --> 00:18:04,838
Look, Jim...

233
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:06,256
don't forget.

234
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:09,217
Have some cigars?

235
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,511
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

236
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,138
Give them to your friends.

237
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:14,598
No, thanks, Mr. Stark.

238
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:16,766
Frank, he doesn't want any.

239
00:18:23,773 --> 00:18:26,609
Jim, your eggs are on the table, dear.

240
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:32,866
Sit down. Eat. You'll be late.

241
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:34,784
Beau!

242
00:18:40,248 --> 00:18:41,749
Come here, Beau!

243
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:44,961
Beau, come on!

244
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:48,089
I don't think I want anything.

245
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:50,549
I'm nervous.

246
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,552
My first day of school,
Mother made me eat so much...

247
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:55,554
I couldn't swallow until recess.

248
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:57,598
Did you fix any sandwiches?

249
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,142
There's meatloaf and peanut butter...

250
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:05,981
What did I tell you? Peanut butter.

251
00:19:08,484 --> 00:19:10,360
There's a thermos of orange juice...

252
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:12,738
and some applesauce cake to go with it.

253
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:14,281
And I baked it.

254
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:21,496
Goodbye, Mom.

255
00:19:21,705 --> 00:19:25,542
Young fellow, you knock them dead
like your old man used to.

256
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:28,503
You know what I think?

257
00:19:28,712 --> 00:19:31,256
I feel maybe we'll stay here awhile.

258
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,676
Listen, watch out
about choosing your pals.

259
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:36,344
Don't let them choose you.

260
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:52,860
Wait a minute.

261
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:04,788
I've seen you before.

262
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,875
- Stop the world!
- You don't have to be unfriendly.

263
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:09,710
Well, now that's true.

264
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,296
But life is crushing in on me.

265
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,757
Life can be beautiful.

266
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:21,096
- I know where it was.
- Where what was?

267
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,307
Where I first saw you.

268
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:28,019
Everything going okay now?

269
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,481
You live here, don't you?

270
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,650
Who lives?

271
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,194
Hey, where's Dawson High?

272
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,279
At University and Tenth.

273
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,864
Thanks.

274
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,408
You want to carry my books?

275
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,038
I got my car. You want to go with me?

276
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,040
I go with the kids.

277
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,086
I'll bet.

278
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,427
All right.

279
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,390
You know, I bet you're a real yo-yo.

280
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,937
I love you too.

281
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,405
What's that?

282
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,369
- That's a new disease.
- Friend of yours?

283
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,788
- Glad they let you out.
- Nobody chickened.

284
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,208
- You're lucky he lived.
- They always live.

285
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,252
Man, I'm living!

286
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,007
Hey, which way to University and Tenth?

287
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,968
Which way is it to University and Tenth?

288
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,638
- It's that way!
- No, it's that way!

289
00:22:47,572 --> 00:22:48,698
Hey, watch it!

290
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:51,409
Where do you think you're going?

291
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:56,289
You stepped on the school insignia.
Nobody does that, ever!

292
00:22:56,498 --> 00:22:58,416
I'm sorry. It's my first day here...

293
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:00,543
and nobody told me about it.

294
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:02,545
- I'm very sorry.
- It's okay.

295
00:23:02,754 --> 00:23:04,005
Know where to report?

296
00:23:04,547 --> 00:23:05,715
Mr. Bassett.

297
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:09,927
Room 208. He'll show you where to go.

298
00:23:10,136 --> 00:23:11,512
I'm sorry about that.

299
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:13,556
Just watch it next time.

300
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:35,135
and immensity of our universe.

301
00:24:35,302 --> 00:24:37,888
For many days
before the end of our Earth...

302
00:24:38,347 --> 00:24:41,517
people will look
into the night sky and notice a star...

303
00:24:41,725 --> 00:24:44,686
increasingly bright and increasingly near.

304
00:24:44,895 --> 00:24:46,730
As this star approaches us...

305
00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:49,858
Jim Stark.

306
00:24:50,984 --> 00:24:52,778
I'll go find a place. I'm sorry.

307
00:24:52,861 --> 00:24:55,947
As this star approaches us,
the weather will change.

308
00:24:56,364 --> 00:25:00,535
The great polar fields of the north
and south will rot and divide.

309
00:25:00,744 --> 00:25:03,163
And the seas will turn warmer.

310
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:06,749
The last of us search the heavens
and stand amazed.

311
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:09,419
For the stars will still be there...

312
00:25:09,627 --> 00:25:12,088
moving through their ancient rhythms.

313
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,425
The familiar constellations
that illuminate our night...

314
00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:17,677
will seem as they have always seemed:

315
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,763
Eternal, unchanged and little moved...

316
00:25:20,972 --> 00:25:24,350
by the shortness of time
between our planet's birth and demise.

317
00:25:26,018 --> 00:25:27,770
Orion, the hunter.

318
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:29,605
One of Ptolemy's constellations...

319
00:25:29,689 --> 00:25:32,024
and the most brilliant in the heavens.

320
00:25:32,191 --> 00:25:33,025
Boy!

321
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:36,529
What?

322
00:25:38,155 --> 00:25:39,740
I was just thinking that...

323
00:25:39,949 --> 00:25:42,826
once you've been up there
you know you been some place.

324
00:25:46,663 --> 00:25:48,165
Gesundheit!

325
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:51,168
They're almost equal in brilliancy.

326
00:25:52,878 --> 00:25:54,629
Cancer, the crab...

327
00:25:54,838 --> 00:25:59,301
containing a large, loose cluster of stars,
called Praesepe or the Beehive.

328
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:02,179
I'm a crab!

329
00:26:04,514 --> 00:26:07,183
The sun can be vertically overhead.

330
00:26:11,312 --> 00:26:13,231
Taurus, the bull.

331
00:26:21,698 --> 00:26:23,282
That's real funny.

332
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:26,828
A comedian, Buzz.

333
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,747
He's cute. I bet he's real rough too.

334
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:32,083
I bet he fights cows.

335
00:26:39,757 --> 00:26:41,717
You shouldn't monkey with him.

336
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,762
- He's a wheel.
- Who?

337
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,096
Buzz.

338
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:48,098
So is she.

339
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:51,602
It's hard to make friends with these guys.

340
00:26:53,896 --> 00:26:55,689
I don't want to make friends.

341
00:26:57,357 --> 00:26:59,192
And while the flash of our beginning...

342
00:26:59,276 --> 00:27:02,487
has not yet traveled
the light years into distance...

343
00:27:02,696 --> 00:27:06,616
has not yet been seen by planets
deep within the other galaxies...

344
00:27:06,783 --> 00:27:10,662
we will disappear into the blackness
of the space from which we came...

345
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:15,375
destroyed as we began,
in a burst of gas and fire.

346
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:37,980
The heavens are still and cold once more.

347
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:42,943
In all the immensity of our universe
and the galaxies beyond...

348
00:27:43,152 --> 00:27:45,237
the Earth will not be missed.

349
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:47,615
Through the infinite reaches of space...

350
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:51,327
the problems of man seem
trivial and naive indeed.

351
00:27:51,994 --> 00:27:54,955
And man, existing alone...

352
00:27:55,164 --> 00:27:58,083
seems himself an episode
of little consequence.

353
00:27:58,667 --> 00:27:59,960
That's all.

354
00:28:00,335 --> 00:28:02,546
Thank you for your attention.

355
00:28:02,838 --> 00:28:04,506
Thank you very much.

356
00:28:08,301 --> 00:28:11,471
May I have your attention?
May I please have your attention?

357
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,684
Classes will meet at the busses outside.
May I have your attention?

358
00:28:15,892 --> 00:28:18,019
May I have your attention?

359
00:28:18,353 --> 00:28:19,854
Oh, what the heck!

360
00:28:36,037 --> 00:28:37,789
It's all over. The world ended.

361
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,250
What does he know about man alone?

362
00:28:58,851 --> 00:29:00,853
Certainly is a lot of switches.

363
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:02,855
Yeah, quite intricate.

364
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:06,650
- Hey, what's for kicks?
- What do you say, Buzz?

365
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:08,485
Well, what do you want to do?

366
00:29:09,069 --> 00:29:11,530
- How about Moo?
- You mean the guy in there?

367
00:29:11,738 --> 00:29:13,573
- The comedian.
- What do you say?

368
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,368
All right! What do you want to do?

369
00:29:16,576 --> 00:29:18,286
Let's bring him down.

370
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:20,330
He'd make a good pigeon.

371
00:29:20,747 --> 00:29:24,584
- What's the funny guy doing?
- The guy in back of us, Buzz.

372
00:29:24,793 --> 00:29:27,170
He ought to have his wardrobe
cleaned and burned.

373
00:29:27,253 --> 00:29:29,464
- All right, Moo.
- All right.

374
00:29:30,757 --> 00:29:32,926
- What will we do with him?
- Don't worry.

375
00:29:33,134 --> 00:29:35,762
I'll figure out what we'll do with him.

376
00:29:36,512 --> 00:29:38,598
Relax. He'll figure it out.

377
00:30:19,471 --> 00:30:20,931
What are you looking at?

378
00:30:21,807 --> 00:30:22,933
Nothing.

379
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,531
I told you not to fool with those guys.
Now they're laying for you.

380
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:41,367
If you don't want trouble,
I know where we can go.

381
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:42,785
It's a big mansion.

382
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:50,751
There it is.

383
00:30:51,377 --> 00:30:53,629
We could sneak around
and they wouldn't know.

384
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:56,507
- Who lives there?
- Nobody lives there.

385
00:30:56,966 --> 00:30:58,467
Come on, let's go!

386
00:31:00,344 --> 00:31:01,262
There he is.

387
00:31:12,815 --> 00:31:13,774
That's his car.

388
00:32:01,112 --> 00:32:02,405
Relax, man.

389
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:07,218
- You know something?
- No, what?

390
00:33:07,301 --> 00:33:09,303
You read too many comic books.

391
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:13,974
Well, he's real abstract! He's different.

392
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:15,518
That's right.

393
00:33:18,312 --> 00:33:20,022
I'm cute too.

394
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:25,027
Is that meaning me?

395
00:33:25,486 --> 00:33:26,987
- Is that meaning me?
- What?

396
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:28,447
Chicken!

397
00:33:29,114 --> 00:33:30,032
Yes.

398
00:33:30,782 --> 00:33:32,326
You shouldn't call me that.

399
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:43,503
How about you?

400
00:33:46,548 --> 00:33:48,592
Are you always at ringside?

401
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:52,178
What are you hanging around
such rank company for?

402
00:33:56,015 --> 00:33:56,975
What?

403
00:34:00,186 --> 00:34:01,688
I don't want any trouble.

404
00:34:01,854 --> 00:34:03,606
The blade game, Buzz?

405
00:34:09,278 --> 00:34:11,614
I thought only punks fought with knives.

406
00:34:12,031 --> 00:34:13,532
Who's fighting?

407
00:34:13,741 --> 00:34:16,285
No fighting. It's examination time, man.

408
00:34:16,494 --> 00:34:18,662
It's a crazy game.

409
00:34:20,206 --> 00:34:21,457
Get him a knife.

410
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,461
Give it to him.

411
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:29,256
Come on, give him a knife.

412
00:34:29,423 --> 00:34:31,508
- Pick it up!
- I don't want any trouble.

413
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:33,135
Pick it up!

414
00:34:39,516 --> 00:34:40,559
Pick it up!

415
00:34:48,108 --> 00:34:49,860
Now, you understand the action?

416
00:34:50,235 --> 00:34:52,112
There's no sticking.

417
00:34:53,238 --> 00:34:54,531
Crunch?

418
00:34:58,618 --> 00:34:59,536
Just...

419
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,539
a little jabbing. That's all.

420
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:05,833
What's the matter?

421
00:35:07,543 --> 00:35:09,087
What's the matter?

422
00:35:09,295 --> 00:35:12,965
What're you waiting on, toreador?
I thought you wanted a little action.

423
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:18,888
- Are you crumb chicken or...
- Don't call me that!

424
00:35:22,224 --> 00:35:23,225
Toro!

425
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,142
Cut off a button and
you get to join the club.

426
00:36:06,351 --> 00:36:07,602
Oh, that's close!

427
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:16,944
Look out, Buzz! He's got a chain!

428
00:36:26,454 --> 00:36:27,622
Dr. Minton!

429
00:36:35,254 --> 00:36:38,007
All right, you asked for it, you've got it.

430
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:40,843
- What is it?
- Trouble.

431
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:44,221
Are you satisfied or
do you want some more?

432
00:36:50,561 --> 00:36:51,979
There's your audience.

433
00:36:52,187 --> 00:36:53,522
I don't think so.

434
00:36:54,147 --> 00:36:55,107
Let's split, Buzz.

435
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,818
Split for what?
A couple of old poopheads?

436
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:05,200
Now, you say the word and you're dead.

437
00:37:05,867 --> 00:37:06,993
You're cold.

438
00:37:07,202 --> 00:37:09,913
I'll meet you someplace,
but not with those things.

439
00:37:10,622 --> 00:37:12,248
That's trouble.

440
00:37:15,043 --> 00:37:17,962
How then? You know the Millertown bluff?

441
00:37:18,213 --> 00:37:20,798
The bluff?
Hey, Buzz, that's dangerous up there.

442
00:37:21,883 --> 00:37:26,262
Cookie, get some cars, and we'll have
some kicks tonight about 8:00.

443
00:37:26,471 --> 00:37:28,264
- All right.
- We'll have a chickie-run.

444
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:29,557
Sounds good. Fine.

445
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:31,601
You ever been in a chickie-run?

446
00:37:32,727 --> 00:37:34,228
That's all I ever do.

447
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:37,440
Come on, all of you. Start moving!

448
00:37:37,648 --> 00:37:38,816
Come on, get going.

449
00:37:38,899 --> 00:37:41,068
Oh, you don't mean little old us?

450
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:43,654
What's the matter with the nice man?

451
00:37:45,072 --> 00:37:47,032
We were just cutting out!

452
00:37:47,992 --> 00:37:49,034
Eight o'clock?

453
00:37:49,451 --> 00:37:50,911
Yeah.

454
00:37:52,454 --> 00:37:53,497
Okay.

455
00:38:04,174 --> 00:38:06,593
Plato, what is a chickie-run?

456
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:39,959
Mom?

457
00:38:42,837 --> 00:38:45,589
Hi, Jimbo. You thought I was Mom?

458
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:49,426
Yeah.

459
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:53,264
Well, the girl's out.
I was getting Mom some supper.

460
00:38:53,555 --> 00:38:55,683
She doesn't feel too well.

461
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,311
What'd you do, drop it?

462
00:38:59,812 --> 00:39:00,979
You dropped it?

463
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:09,905
- That's funny.
- I know it.

464
00:39:09,988 --> 00:39:13,742
- I'll clean up before she sees it.
- Let her see it.

465
00:39:16,411 --> 00:39:17,495
Let her see it!

466
00:39:18,663 --> 00:39:20,498
What can happen? She's...

467
00:39:25,503 --> 00:39:26,504
Dad?

468
00:39:40,685 --> 00:39:42,520
Stand. Don't...

469
00:39:43,187 --> 00:39:45,106
I mean, you shouldn't...

470
00:39:56,325 --> 00:39:57,368
Beau?

471
00:40:02,581 --> 00:40:03,707
Daddy?

472
00:40:05,084 --> 00:40:06,835
Haven't you forgotten something?

473
00:40:10,255 --> 00:40:11,715
What's the matter with you?

474
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:15,886
You're too old for that stuff.
I thought you'd stopped that long ago.

475
00:40:18,305 --> 00:40:19,848
I didn't want to stop.

476
00:40:20,724 --> 00:40:23,268
- Didn't want to stop what?
- Nothing, nothing.

477
00:40:23,977 --> 00:40:25,103
I was talking to Dad.

478
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:27,897
I didn't kiss her, so it's a big thing.

479
00:40:28,732 --> 00:40:30,734
Bertha, you may serve the souffle.

480
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:32,318
It's fish souffle.

481
00:40:33,236 --> 00:40:36,906
You don't have to stand, darling.
Sit down and have your tomato juice.

482
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,744
I guess I just don't understand anything.

483
00:40:42,245 --> 00:40:45,081
I'm tired. I'd like to change the subject.

484
00:40:45,665 --> 00:40:46,874
Why?

485
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,918
I'd just like to, that's all!

486
00:40:49,126 --> 00:40:52,672
Girls your age don't do things like that!
You need an explanation?

487
00:40:53,422 --> 00:40:54,799
Hi, rascal!

488
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:57,802
Girls don't love their father?

489
00:40:58,344 --> 00:40:59,595
Since when?

490
00:41:00,095 --> 00:41:01,847
Since I got to be 16?

491
00:41:03,057 --> 00:41:04,934
Stop that! Sit down!

492
00:41:08,979 --> 00:41:11,065
May I please be excused?

493
00:41:15,903 --> 00:41:17,446
Hey, glamour puss!

494
00:41:17,738 --> 00:41:20,699
I'm sorry. We'll break the date.
We'll stay home.

495
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:22,868
This isn't my home!

496
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:33,295
I don't know what to do.

497
00:41:33,461 --> 00:41:35,922
All of a sudden she's a problem.

498
00:41:36,423 --> 00:41:39,676
She'll outgrow it, dear. It's just the age.

499
00:41:39,884 --> 00:41:41,469
The atomic age!

500
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:50,561
It's just the age when nothing fits.

501
00:42:04,366 --> 00:42:05,493
Hey, Jimbo?

502
00:42:08,662 --> 00:42:09,914
- You awake?
- Dad?

503
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:12,374
Can I ask you something?

504
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,126
Sure.

505
00:42:17,212 --> 00:42:18,088
Shoot.

506
00:42:18,672 --> 00:42:21,842
Suppose you had to do something.

507
00:42:24,177 --> 00:42:25,679
You had to go someplace...

508
00:42:26,722 --> 00:42:28,849
and do this thing that was...

509
00:42:29,516 --> 00:42:31,643
you know, it was very dangerous.

510
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:34,980
But it was a matter of honor.

511
00:42:37,357 --> 00:42:39,109
And you had to prove it.

512
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:41,027
What would you do?

513
00:42:42,112 --> 00:42:45,365
Well, is there some kind of trick answer?

514
00:42:45,907 --> 00:42:47,992
No, what would you do?

515
00:42:48,743 --> 00:42:51,704
Well, I wouldn't make a hasty decision.

516
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,373
Tell you what, Jimbo.

517
00:42:53,581 --> 00:42:56,542
Let's get a little light on the subject.

518
00:43:05,217 --> 00:43:06,260
Blood.

519
00:43:09,055 --> 00:43:10,556
Jim, what happened?

520
00:43:10,723 --> 00:43:13,309
What kind of trouble are you in?

521
00:43:16,395 --> 00:43:19,315
The kind I was telling you about.
Now can you answer me?

522
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:23,402
Nobody can make a snap decision.

523
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:26,029
It's one of those things that you...
You can't.

524
00:43:26,238 --> 00:43:27,865
That's all there is to it.

525
00:43:28,824 --> 00:43:31,243
It's something that you... You just don't.

526
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,917
We've got to consider
all the pros and cons.

527
00:43:39,334 --> 00:43:40,752
I don't have time.

528
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:42,212
We'll make time.

529
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,422
I'll get paper and we'll make a list.

530
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,466
And then if we're still stuck...

531
00:43:46,966 --> 00:43:49,177
we'll get some advice.

532
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,684
What can you do
when you have to be a man?

533
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,227
Well...

534
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,022
No, you give me a direct answer!

535
00:44:01,314 --> 00:44:03,441
Are you going to keep me from going?

536
00:44:04,025 --> 00:44:06,068
Did I ever stop you from anything?

537
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,279
You're at a wonderful age.

538
00:44:08,362 --> 00:44:11,407
In ten years, you'll look back
on this and wish...

539
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:13,075
Ten years?

540
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:17,204
I want an answer now. I need one.

541
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:22,626
Listen, Jimbo, I'm just trying
to show you how foolish you are.

542
00:44:22,835 --> 00:44:25,879
When you're older,
you'll look back at this...

543
00:44:26,088 --> 00:44:28,132
and you'll laugh at yourself...

544
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:31,468
for thinking that this is so important.

545
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,137
It's not as if you were alone.

546
00:44:34,346 --> 00:44:37,057
This has happened to every boy.

547
00:44:37,766 --> 00:44:41,853
It happened to me when I was your age,
maybe a year older.

548
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:47,651
What's all the excitement?

549
00:44:47,734 --> 00:44:50,445
I've been working hard
getting this house in order...

550
00:44:50,528 --> 00:44:51,988
Jim had blood on him.

551
00:44:52,197 --> 00:44:55,116
- He just ran out.
- And you didn't stop him?

552
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:47,834
Hey, Chicken Little!

553
00:45:48,043 --> 00:45:50,212
Where's toreador? He beg off?

554
00:45:50,378 --> 00:45:52,506
He's not scared of you.

555
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:58,595
- There he is.
- Over there, man.

556
00:46:03,683 --> 00:46:06,269
- How did you get here?
- I hitched.

557
00:46:07,478 --> 00:46:10,356
I bet you'd go to a hanging, wouldn't you?

558
00:46:10,565 --> 00:46:13,151
I guess it's just my morbid personality.

559
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:16,112
Should I leave?

560
00:46:16,195 --> 00:46:17,530
No, it's okay.

561
00:46:33,712 --> 00:46:36,048
Come on. Let's go see what we're driving.

562
00:46:46,475 --> 00:46:48,101
No, just him.

563
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:50,187
It's okay. Stay here.

564
00:46:53,023 --> 00:46:54,983
What did you say your name was?

565
00:46:56,109 --> 00:46:57,486
Jim Stark.

566
00:46:57,694 --> 00:47:00,155
Yeah, I'm Buzz Gunderson.

567
00:47:03,116 --> 00:47:04,951
I got some goodies for you.

568
00:47:05,118 --> 00:47:06,786
You got a flashlight?

569
00:47:11,457 --> 00:47:13,209
Is he a friend of yours?

570
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,757
Yeah, he's my best friend.

571
00:47:21,259 --> 00:47:22,635
What's he like?

572
00:47:25,805 --> 00:47:27,390
I don't know.

573
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:29,642
You have to get to know him.

574
00:47:30,643 --> 00:47:32,061
He doesn't say much.

575
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:34,480
But when he does, you know he means it.

576
00:47:34,772 --> 00:47:36,232
He's sincere.

577
00:47:37,316 --> 00:47:39,068
Well, that's the main thing.

578
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:41,654
- You want to flip?
- Yeah, go ahead.

579
00:47:44,782 --> 00:47:45,949
Heads.

580
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:52,581
Maybe next summer, he'll take me
hunting with him. And fishing.

581
00:47:53,415 --> 00:47:57,252
I want him to teach me because
I know he won't get mad if I goof.

582
00:47:58,337 --> 00:47:59,671
His name's Jim.

583
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,091
It's really James, but he likes Jim more.

584
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:07,887
And people he really likes,
he lets them call him Jamie.

585
00:48:08,597 --> 00:48:09,806
Jamie?

586
00:48:11,182 --> 00:48:12,600
Try the doors.

587
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,856
Hey, try it with the jump.

588
00:48:45,049 --> 00:48:46,675
That's the edge.

589
00:48:48,177 --> 00:48:49,219
That's the end.

590
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:54,892
Certainly is.

591
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:00,188
You know something?

592
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:04,317
I like you.

593
00:49:05,736 --> 00:49:07,112
You know that?

594
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:10,407
Why do we do this?

595
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,742
You got to do something...

596
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:14,494
now, don't you?

597
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,406
Take them up all the way to the end.

598
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,033
Get all the girls!

599
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,660
Bring it up to the left side.

600
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,167
Crunch, line them up!

601
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,628
Go to the end and
bring your cars up on the right.

602
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,047
Put your car on the left-hand side.

603
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,550
Turn your lights in toward the center.

604
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,135
Let's line them up!

605
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,803
Moose, come here.

606
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,306
Straighten them out.
Tell them when to turn on their lights.

607
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,933
Johnny!

608
00:50:20,141 --> 00:50:22,686
Follow that dark roadster over there.

609
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:34,989
You're okay?

610
00:50:35,156 --> 00:50:36,491
Give me some dirt.

611
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,751
Hey, toreador!

612
00:50:49,128 --> 00:50:50,338
She signals...

613
00:50:50,504 --> 00:50:52,423
we head for the edge.

614
00:50:52,965 --> 00:50:55,176
And the first man who jumps is a chicken.

615
00:50:55,676 --> 00:50:57,011
All right?

616
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:20,492
Me too.

617
00:51:23,036 --> 00:51:25,497
May I have some dirt, please?

618
00:52:05,786 --> 00:52:07,746
Hit your lights!

619
00:53:42,464 --> 00:53:43,423
Where's Buzz?

620
00:53:43,506 --> 00:53:45,008
Down there.

621
00:53:51,222 --> 00:53:52,682
Let's get out of here!

622
00:54:00,106 --> 00:54:01,149
Down there.

623
00:54:01,357 --> 00:54:03,234
Down there is Buzz!

624
00:55:08,422 --> 00:55:09,924
This is fine.

625
00:55:21,268 --> 00:55:22,728
You'll be all right?

626
00:55:36,783 --> 00:55:38,410
You want to see a monkey?

627
00:56:12,819 --> 00:56:15,863
Want to come home with me?
There's nobody at my house.

628
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:18,240
Heck, I'm not tired. Are you?

629
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:20,826
I don't have too many people I can talk to.

630
00:56:21,035 --> 00:56:22,453
Who has?

631
00:56:22,995 --> 00:56:24,955
If you want to come, we could talk...

632
00:56:25,164 --> 00:56:27,917
then we could have breakfast,
like my dad used to.

633
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,835
If only you could've been my dad...

634
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:31,337
You flipped or something?

635
00:56:31,545 --> 00:56:32,671
Look.

636
00:56:34,673 --> 00:56:37,092
I'll see you in the morning, okay?

637
00:56:37,426 --> 00:56:40,137
I've got to pick up my scooter anyway,
you know.

638
00:56:40,345 --> 00:56:41,597
I know.

639
00:56:46,935 --> 00:56:48,353
See you tomorrow.

640
00:57:16,506 --> 00:57:18,758
Hello, little cute sister.

641
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:24,055
Hello, darling, baby-pie,
glamour puss, sweetie.

642
00:57:29,226 --> 00:57:30,895
You belong in bed.

643
00:59:15,663 --> 00:59:17,165
He's home!

644
00:59:17,457 --> 00:59:19,000
You're home!

645
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:26,841
You're home.

646
00:59:27,008 --> 00:59:28,718
Are you all right?

647
00:59:28,926 --> 00:59:30,887
Where were you? We were so worried.

648
00:59:32,555 --> 00:59:35,016
I wouldn't take a sleeping pill
till you were home.

649
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:38,019
Can I talk to you guys?
I have to talk to somebody.

650
00:59:43,524 --> 00:59:46,026
You better give me an answer this time.

651
00:59:46,193 --> 00:59:47,695
Go ahead.

652
00:59:47,987 --> 00:59:49,947
A direct answer.

653
00:59:51,031 --> 00:59:52,700
I'm in trouble.

654
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:55,661
You know that big,
high bluff near Millertown?

655
00:59:55,869 --> 00:59:57,746
Yes, there was a bad accident there.

656
00:59:57,955 --> 01:00:01,124
They showed the pictures on television.

657
01:00:02,042 --> 01:00:03,043
I was in it.

658
01:00:03,126 --> 01:00:04,127
How can you...

659
01:00:04,336 --> 01:00:06,922
It doesn't matter how.
I was driving a stolen car.

660
01:00:07,005 --> 01:00:10,967
That's a fine thing! Do you enjoy
doing this to me, or what?

661
01:00:11,176 --> 01:00:14,095
- You wanted him to make a list!
- Let him tell it!

662
01:00:14,304 --> 01:00:15,847
She doesn't care!

663
01:00:16,056 --> 01:00:19,392
You remember how I almost died
giving birth to him?

664
01:00:19,601 --> 01:00:22,812
- And then you say I don't care!
- Please relax, relax!

665
01:00:28,067 --> 01:00:29,152
Dad...

666
01:00:30,153 --> 01:00:33,072
I said it was a matter of honor.

667
01:00:33,573 --> 01:00:34,657
Remember?

668
01:00:37,743 --> 01:00:39,579
They called me chicken.

669
01:00:41,247 --> 01:00:43,749
You know? Chicken?

670
01:00:48,254 --> 01:00:49,797
I had to go.

671
01:00:59,473 --> 01:01:02,768
If I didn't, I'd never be able
to face those kids again.

672
01:01:07,773 --> 01:01:09,983
I got in one of those cars...

673
01:01:10,484 --> 01:01:13,737
and Buzz, one of those kids,
he got in the other car...

674
01:01:13,945 --> 01:01:16,281
and we had to drive fast...

675
01:01:16,615 --> 01:01:19,367
and then jump before the car
came to the edge.

676
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:22,120
And I got out okay and Buzz didn't.

677
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,791
And it killed him.

678
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:28,960
I can't keep it to myself anymore.

679
01:01:29,127 --> 01:01:31,004
You just get it off your chest.

680
01:01:31,212 --> 01:01:33,840
That is not what I mean!

681
01:01:35,633 --> 01:01:38,219
I have never done anything right.

682
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:41,806
I've been going around with
my head in a sling for years.

683
01:01:42,473 --> 01:01:45,852
I don't want to drag you into this,
but I can't help it.

684
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,562
You see, I think...

685
01:01:48,813 --> 01:01:53,651
you can't just go around proving
things and pretending like you're tough.

686
01:01:53,859 --> 01:01:54,860
That's right.

687
01:01:55,069 --> 01:01:58,155
And even though you got to
look a certain way...

688
01:01:58,364 --> 01:02:00,991
- You're absolutely right!
- You look, you feel...

689
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,494
You're not listening to me!

690
01:02:03,994 --> 01:02:06,747
You're involved in this, just like I am!

691
01:02:07,956 --> 01:02:11,168
I'm going to the police
and telling them I'm involved.

692
01:02:11,335 --> 01:02:12,544
Did anyone see you?

693
01:02:12,753 --> 01:02:15,631
- Did anyone see your license plate?
- I don't know!

694
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:17,966
Will the others go to the police?

695
01:02:18,175 --> 01:02:20,177
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

696
01:02:20,385 --> 01:02:23,430
- Why be the only one involved?
- Far be it from me...

697
01:02:23,638 --> 01:02:26,308
Do we have to listen to a sermon now?

698
01:02:26,516 --> 01:02:28,393
I'm telling him what you mean.

699
01:02:28,602 --> 01:02:32,105
You can't be idealistic all your life.
Nobody thanks you for...

700
01:02:32,313 --> 01:02:35,358
- Except to yourself!
- Wait a minute!

701
01:02:35,525 --> 01:02:37,193
Except yourself.

702
01:02:38,862 --> 01:02:40,196
You don't want me to go?

703
01:02:41,406 --> 01:02:43,700
No, I don't want you to go to the police.

704
01:02:43,866 --> 01:02:46,369
Why should you be the only one involved?

705
01:02:46,577 --> 01:02:50,414
But I am involved! We are all involved!

706
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:55,378
A boy, a kid was killed tonight!

707
01:02:56,087 --> 01:02:58,923
I can't get out of it and
pretend it didn't happen!

708
01:02:59,131 --> 01:03:02,218
Well, you know
that you did the wrong thing.

709
01:03:02,384 --> 01:03:04,845
- That's the main thing.
- That's nothing.

710
01:03:05,054 --> 01:03:07,806
That is absolutely nothing. Dad, you said...

711
01:03:08,015 --> 01:03:11,310
you want me to tell the truth.
Didn't you say that?

712
01:03:15,647 --> 01:03:17,191
You can't turn it off.

713
01:03:17,399 --> 01:03:21,194
He's not saying that.
He's saying just don't volunteer!

714
01:03:21,987 --> 01:03:23,739
Just tell a little white lie.

715
01:03:23,905 --> 01:03:26,867
You'll learn! When you're older, Jim.

716
01:03:27,617 --> 01:03:30,871
Well, I don't think
that I want to learn that way.

717
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:33,832
It doesn't matter anyway,
because we're moving!

718
01:03:34,499 --> 01:03:35,917
Don't tear me loose again.

719
01:03:36,084 --> 01:03:38,753
- Just why are we moving?
- Must I spell it out?

720
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,673
- You won't use me as an excuse again!
- I don't!

721
01:03:41,881 --> 01:03:44,092
When you can't face yourself
you blame me!

722
01:03:44,259 --> 01:03:45,718
That is not true!

723
01:03:46,553 --> 01:03:49,097
You say it's because of me
or the neighborhood!

724
01:03:49,263 --> 01:03:51,974
You use every other phony excuse!

725
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,895
Mom, I just...
Once, I want to do something right!

726
01:03:56,103 --> 01:03:59,065
And I don't want you
to run away from me again!

727
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:06,030
- This is all going too fast.
- You better give me something.

728
01:04:06,238 --> 01:04:08,407
You better give me something fast.

729
01:04:08,616 --> 01:04:10,242
Jimmy, you're very young.

730
01:04:10,451 --> 01:04:13,120
A foolish decision now
could wreck your whole life!

731
01:04:13,329 --> 01:04:16,623
- In ten years you won't know it happened.
- Dad, answer her.

732
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:19,668
Tell her.

733
01:04:21,378 --> 01:04:22,963
Ten years.

734
01:04:25,257 --> 01:04:27,509
Dad, let me hear you answer her.

735
01:04:41,606 --> 01:04:43,525
Dad, stand up for me.

736
01:04:54,494 --> 01:04:55,995
Stand up!

737
01:04:57,997 --> 01:04:59,165
You'll kill him!

738
01:05:02,001 --> 01:05:03,252
You're killing him!

739
01:05:03,711 --> 01:05:05,504
You want to kill your own father?

740
01:05:43,667 --> 01:05:46,878
- See how they brought us in like that?
- Let go of me!

741
01:05:47,087 --> 01:05:49,255
You want a good crack in the mouth?

742
01:05:49,464 --> 01:05:51,758
Take it easy, Ed. The boy's on edge.

743
01:05:52,008 --> 01:05:54,511
- Come on.
- He shouldn't talk to me that way.

744
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:56,763
After all, I am his father.

745
01:05:57,347 --> 01:05:59,807
This place appeal to you or something?

746
01:06:07,982 --> 01:06:10,318
- What's he going to pull?
- Nothing, Crunch.

747
01:06:10,526 --> 01:06:13,863
- Did you see any cops with him?
- He was pulled in like us.

748
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:17,575
Hey, excuse me.
Can you tell me where I can find...

749
01:06:18,617 --> 01:06:21,120
I forgot his name.
He works in the juvenile...

750
01:06:21,328 --> 01:06:22,580
Can't you see I'm writing?

751
01:06:24,748 --> 01:06:26,959
He's going to tell, man. I know.

752
01:06:28,002 --> 01:06:29,670
Nobody arrested him.

753
01:06:30,295 --> 01:06:31,672
I think I better go home.

754
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,507
Hey, wait, man.

755
01:06:34,341 --> 01:06:36,134
We'll have some kicks, huh?

756
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:40,847
- Crunch, my father...
- We'll bring him down.

757
01:06:41,056 --> 01:06:42,432
What do you say?

758
01:06:48,688 --> 01:06:50,357
You're going to clobber him?

759
01:06:52,317 --> 01:06:54,694
What, are you out of your mind? Come on.

760
01:06:55,904 --> 01:06:59,032
- What I could write about you...
- I remember his name.

761
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:01,034
- What's the charge?
- Assault.

762
01:07:01,201 --> 01:07:04,704
- His name is Ray. I'd like to see him.
- He's not here.

763
01:07:04,913 --> 01:07:06,414
He's not in Juvenile Hall.

764
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:09,709
I don't know where he is.
He'll be out all night.

765
01:07:09,876 --> 01:07:10,960
How old are you?

766
01:07:11,419 --> 01:07:14,297
My parents know I'm here.
They know I'm out here.

767
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:17,383
Come back in the morning, will you?

768
01:07:17,592 --> 01:07:19,176
Well, can I wait?

769
01:07:20,052 --> 01:07:22,013
Have you ever been booked before?

770
01:07:22,513 --> 01:07:24,056
Solid.

771
01:07:52,751 --> 01:07:53,835
Hello?

772
01:07:54,377 --> 01:07:55,670
Who wants her?

773
01:07:56,463 --> 01:07:57,464
Who?

774
01:07:58,131 --> 01:07:59,591
Jim who?

775
01:08:00,258 --> 01:08:01,760
I never heard of you!

776
01:08:04,637 --> 01:08:07,015
He didn't have to hang up on him.

777
01:08:40,005 --> 01:08:41,423
Hello, Jamie.

778
01:08:42,716 --> 01:08:43,884
Jamie?

779
01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:54,936
Where'd you get that?

780
01:09:00,484 --> 01:09:02,485
How long have you known Plato?

781
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,325
About...

782
01:09:10,076 --> 01:09:12,454
- Coming up, another request.
... this morning.

783
01:09:12,662 --> 01:09:15,832
This time, from the boys
at Anna's Pizza Paradise.

784
01:09:15,999 --> 01:09:19,002
A new arrangement
of an oldie in rhythm and blues.

785
01:09:19,252 --> 01:09:21,504
Jim, this is dedicated to you...

786
01:09:21,963 --> 01:09:23,297
from Buzz.

787
01:09:41,357 --> 01:09:43,108
They'll be looking for you.

788
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:48,530
I didn't chicken. You saw where I jumped.

789
01:09:48,697 --> 01:09:50,783
What do I have to do, kill myself?

790
01:09:51,867 --> 01:09:54,161
It doesn't matter to them.

791
01:09:55,662 --> 01:09:58,540
Well, I guess you're still pretty upset, huh?

792
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:02,252
I'm just numb.

793
01:10:10,176 --> 01:10:11,636
You know something?

794
01:10:14,055 --> 01:10:16,391
I woke up this morning, you know?

795
01:10:18,601 --> 01:10:20,562
And the sun was shining...

796
01:10:21,104 --> 01:10:22,939
and it was nice...

797
01:10:23,481 --> 01:10:25,400
and all that type of stuff.

798
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:28,861
And the first thing, I saw you.

799
01:10:32,115 --> 01:10:33,241
And I said:

800
01:10:33,533 --> 01:10:37,370
"This will be one terrific day,
so you better live it up...

801
01:10:37,578 --> 01:10:41,040
because tomorrow you'll be nothing. "

802
01:10:42,083 --> 01:10:43,667
See? And I almost was.

803
01:10:45,586 --> 01:10:47,046
I'm sorry.

804
01:10:48,589 --> 01:10:51,258
I'm sorry that I treated you mean today.

805
01:10:52,593 --> 01:10:56,096
Don't believe what I say
when I'm with the rest of the kids.

806
01:10:57,056 --> 01:10:59,892
Nobody acts sincere.

807
01:11:12,988 --> 01:11:14,447
Why did you do that?

808
01:11:14,614 --> 01:11:16,283
I felt like it.

809
01:11:19,911 --> 01:11:21,705
Your lips are soft.

810
01:11:31,464 --> 01:11:32,632
Where are you going?

811
01:11:32,715 --> 01:11:34,133
I don't know.

812
01:11:38,679 --> 01:11:40,306
We can't stay here.

813
01:11:51,025 --> 01:11:52,735
I know one thing.

814
01:11:54,653 --> 01:11:58,157
- I'm not going back in that zoo.
- I'm never going back!

815
01:12:05,581 --> 01:12:06,832
Listen...

816
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,921
I know a place. Plato told me before.

817
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:15,090
It's an old, deserted mansion...

818
01:12:15,507 --> 01:12:17,342
up by the planetarium.

819
01:12:18,844 --> 01:12:20,512
Want to go up there with me?

820
01:12:29,521 --> 01:12:31,022
You can trust me, Judy.

821
01:12:37,904 --> 01:12:39,989
Okay.

822
01:12:55,921 --> 01:12:58,007
- What do you want?
- Your friend!

823
01:12:58,215 --> 01:13:00,467
Yeah, we got eyes for him. You know it?

824
01:13:01,468 --> 01:13:04,596
- Where does he live?
- You guys better beat it!

825
01:13:04,805 --> 01:13:06,390
Where does he live?

826
01:13:06,598 --> 01:13:08,016
Tell us! Tell us!

827
01:13:08,225 --> 01:13:10,477
- Leave me alone!
- Where does he live?

828
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:13,146
Get him! Come on!

829
01:13:17,609 --> 01:13:18,860
We want your friend!

830
01:13:20,737 --> 01:13:22,906
I got it! I got his address book!

831
01:13:23,115 --> 01:13:24,658
Your friend talked!

832
01:13:24,866 --> 01:13:25,951
Now you talk!

833
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:27,827
Talk! Talk!

834
01:13:28,745 --> 01:13:30,580
What are you doing to him?

835
01:13:32,457 --> 01:13:34,709
Let's get out of here!

836
01:13:35,752 --> 01:13:37,754
- Did you get the book?
- Got it!

837
01:14:01,277 --> 01:14:04,572
Why you want to mix up with
bad boys like that?

838
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:07,616
Why you want to get into trouble
all the time?

839
01:14:09,201 --> 01:14:12,121
What you doing with that?
You put that down!

840
01:14:12,287 --> 01:14:14,748
Put it down before you hurt yourself!

841
01:14:14,957 --> 01:14:16,333
I have to warn him!

842
01:14:19,503 --> 01:14:21,380
You stay home, John!

843
01:14:24,299 --> 01:14:25,967
Bill Sibley.

844
01:14:28,595 --> 01:14:30,305
Sam Stuart.

845
01:14:31,014 --> 01:14:32,891
Stark. Jim Stark. Here it is.

846
01:14:33,099 --> 01:14:36,311
1753 Angelo. Well, well!

847
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:45,069
Frank, I'm frightened!

848
01:14:45,278 --> 01:14:47,655
- What's that pounding?
- I don't know.

849
01:14:47,822 --> 01:14:50,783
At first I thought it was Jim...
He's not home yet.

850
01:14:50,992 --> 01:14:53,619
He's home, dear. I heard his car.

851
01:14:54,037 --> 01:14:58,040
- Well, are you going down there?
- Look, will you please relax?

852
01:14:59,167 --> 01:15:00,501
Now, you see?

853
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:02,336
It stopped.

854
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:06,674
I still think you ought to go down there.

855
01:15:22,397 --> 01:15:23,816
Who's there?

856
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:27,027
Anybody there?

857
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:30,197
Open it.

858
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:43,918
Who's out there?

859
01:15:45,295 --> 01:15:48,214
- Where's your son?
- Where's your baby boy gone to?

860
01:15:48,381 --> 01:15:51,050
- We want to talk to him.
- He's not here.

861
01:15:55,638 --> 01:15:57,223
Look in his room!

862
01:16:04,897 --> 01:16:05,898
Son?

863
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:16,909
Is he there?

864
01:16:17,118 --> 01:16:19,119
No, honey, he's not here.

865
01:16:28,712 --> 01:16:31,298
- What are you doing?
- Do you know where Jim is?

866
01:16:31,423 --> 01:16:33,258
No, I don't know.

867
01:16:33,467 --> 01:16:35,260
Do you know where he is?

868
01:16:38,013 --> 01:16:39,264
I think...

869
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:45,645
I'm sorry I bothered you.

870
01:16:45,854 --> 01:16:47,439
Hey, come back here!

871
01:16:47,606 --> 01:16:48,898
Who are you?

872
01:17:26,227 --> 01:17:27,728
Careful, Jim.

873
01:17:46,663 --> 01:17:48,665
Those noisy neighbors.

874
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:52,210
Come on!

875
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:57,507
Jim, it's me.

876
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,185
They're looking for you.

877
01:18:09,936 --> 01:18:12,271
Everybody.
Crunch and Goon and everybody!

878
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,523
We know.

879
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,734
They think you told the police on them.

880
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:18,361
They're going to...

881
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,033
Who's in there?

882
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,744
Nobody. Just us chickens.

883
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:30,623
Who's in there?

884
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:32,875
Judy. Judy's up there.

885
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:37,046
- Let me in?
- Yeah. All right.

886
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:39,214
But your house is a mess.

887
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:44,720
Watch out.

888
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,392
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

889
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:04,322
Well, we're safe here.

890
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:06,074
I hope.

891
01:19:11,204 --> 01:19:13,164
What do you think of my castle?

892
01:19:18,669 --> 01:19:20,171
Well, now, there, then...

893
01:19:20,379 --> 01:19:22,715
I think we'll take it for the summer.

894
01:19:23,007 --> 01:19:24,592
Right this way.

895
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,639
Would you like to rent it?

896
01:19:29,847 --> 01:19:33,100
Or are you more in the mood to buy, dear?

897
01:19:33,976 --> 01:19:35,895
You decide, darling.

898
01:19:36,353 --> 01:19:39,231
- Remember our budget.
- Don't give it a thought.

899
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,276
It's only $3,000,000 a month.

900
01:19:44,528 --> 01:19:45,779
We can manage that.

901
01:19:45,863 --> 01:19:49,283
I'll scrimp and save
and work my fingers to the bone.

902
01:19:49,491 --> 01:19:51,577
You see, we're newlyweds.

903
01:19:52,578 --> 01:19:54,246
Oh, there's just one thing.

904
01:19:54,454 --> 01:19:55,789
What about...?

905
01:19:57,124 --> 01:19:58,458
Children?

906
01:20:00,085 --> 01:20:01,962
Right this way.

907
01:20:02,796 --> 01:20:03,797
Yes.

908
01:20:04,297 --> 01:20:06,633
We really don't encourage them.

909
01:20:06,967 --> 01:20:09,010
They're so noisy and troublesome.

910
01:20:09,219 --> 01:20:10,720
Don't you agree?

911
01:20:11,262 --> 01:20:13,098
And so annoying when they cry.

912
01:20:13,306 --> 01:20:16,434
I don't know what to do when they cry.
Do you, dear?

913
01:20:16,643 --> 01:20:18,311
Drown them like puppies!

914
01:20:19,145 --> 01:20:22,148
The nursery's far away
from the rest of the house.

915
01:20:22,315 --> 01:20:23,733
Forgot to wind your sundial.

916
01:20:23,816 --> 01:20:27,945
If you have children,
you'll find this is a wonderful arrangement.

917
01:20:29,322 --> 01:20:31,449
They can carry on and you won't notice.

918
01:20:31,657 --> 01:20:33,409
A sunken nursery!

919
01:20:33,826 --> 01:20:37,955
In fact, if you lock them in,
you'll never have to see them again.

920
01:20:38,164 --> 01:20:40,249
- Much less, talk to them.
- Talk to them?

921
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:43,794
- Nobody talks to children.
- No, they just tell them.

922
01:20:46,839 --> 01:20:48,215
What time is it?

923
01:20:49,174 --> 01:20:51,051
Hang loose. We've got all night.

924
01:20:51,468 --> 01:20:55,180
I wonder if the maid could tell
who we were if she saw us again.

925
01:20:55,347 --> 01:20:56,598
Sure she could.

926
01:20:57,266 --> 01:20:58,392
I know she could.

927
01:20:58,684 --> 01:21:00,560
You still want to go home, Moose?

928
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:03,980
Then shut your mouth...

929
01:21:04,231 --> 01:21:06,191
before your guts run out.

930
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:10,529
Quick, fill the pool!

931
01:21:16,034 --> 01:21:18,078
Let's see how long we can stay under.

932
01:21:20,038 --> 01:21:22,081
You can't talk underwater.

933
01:21:44,895 --> 01:21:46,772
I never saw you having so much fun.

934
01:21:46,981 --> 01:21:50,109
I came here a lot of times before,
but I never had fun.

935
01:21:50,317 --> 01:21:51,652
Why not?

936
01:21:52,278 --> 01:21:53,862
Because I was alone.

937
01:21:58,659 --> 01:22:00,327
All right!

938
01:22:02,329 --> 01:22:04,039
What'd you come back here for?

939
01:22:04,248 --> 01:22:07,209
Because I'd run away.
I used to run away a lot...

940
01:22:07,417 --> 01:22:09,086
but they always took me back.

941
01:22:09,169 --> 01:22:10,170
Who?

942
01:22:10,587 --> 01:22:12,005
Mom and Dad.

943
01:22:13,423 --> 01:22:15,717
Now that I don't have them I wish...

944
01:22:16,426 --> 01:22:18,261
I never had run away.

945
01:22:19,638 --> 01:22:21,765
I used to lie in my crib at night...

946
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:24,225
and I'd listen to them fight.

947
01:22:24,851 --> 01:22:26,936
Can you remember back that far?

948
01:22:28,563 --> 01:22:31,941
I can't even remember
what happened yesterday.

949
01:22:33,568 --> 01:22:34,944
I can't.

950
01:22:35,945 --> 01:22:36,863
How do you do it?

951
01:22:36,946 --> 01:22:39,782
I went to a head shrinker.
He made me remember.

952
01:22:39,991 --> 01:22:40,825
Did he?

953
01:22:41,033 --> 01:22:45,246
Then my mother said it cost too much,
so she went to Hawaii instead.

954
01:22:47,581 --> 01:22:49,375
Well, what's your problem?

955
01:22:49,792 --> 01:22:51,293
I don't know...

956
01:22:52,628 --> 01:22:54,046
but I'm happy now.

957
01:22:54,713 --> 01:22:55,881
Here.

958
01:22:56,632 --> 01:22:58,884
I wish we could stay here.

959
01:23:02,096 --> 01:23:03,764
Where's your father now?

960
01:23:06,225 --> 01:23:07,476
He's dead.

961
01:23:08,685 --> 01:23:10,979
He was a hero in the China Sea.

962
01:23:14,358 --> 01:23:16,818
You told me he was
a big wheel in New York.

963
01:23:19,654 --> 01:23:20,947
I did?

964
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,159
What's the difference?

965
01:23:24,951 --> 01:23:26,870
He might as well be dead anyway.

966
01:23:28,204 --> 01:23:29,998
It's all right.

967
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:34,919
Sure. Sure.

968
01:23:45,763 --> 01:23:47,890
I wonder how many rooms in this place?

969
01:23:48,808 --> 01:23:51,477
I don't know. A lot, probably.

970
01:23:51,978 --> 01:23:53,354
Probably.

971
01:23:58,192 --> 01:24:00,027
Do you want to explore?

972
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:44,279
Must have been a nervous day.

973
01:24:44,737 --> 01:24:46,906
He must have started out nervous.

974
01:24:48,408 --> 01:24:50,535
I've done that, though. Haven't you?

975
01:25:27,529 --> 01:25:29,740
That looks like our boy's car, huh?

976
01:25:30,115 --> 01:25:31,992
Well, what do you know?

977
01:25:48,466 --> 01:25:51,010
Is this what it's like to love somebody?

978
01:25:51,386 --> 01:25:52,762
I don't know.

979
01:25:54,806 --> 01:25:57,725
What kind of a person
do you think a girl wants?

980
01:26:00,353 --> 01:26:01,312
A man.

981
01:26:04,482 --> 01:26:07,985
But a man who can be gentle and sweet.

982
01:26:08,903 --> 01:26:10,362
Like you are.

983
01:26:14,033 --> 01:26:17,161
And someone who doesn't
run away when you want them.

984
01:26:18,245 --> 01:26:21,623
Like being Plato's friend
when nobody else liked him.

985
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:24,835
That's being strong.

986
01:26:36,096 --> 01:26:38,515
We're not going to be lonely anymore.

987
01:26:39,474 --> 01:26:41,309
Ever, ever.

988
01:26:42,185 --> 01:26:44,062
Not you or me.

989
01:26:45,522 --> 01:26:47,857
I love somebody.

990
01:26:48,733 --> 01:26:50,568
All the time I've been...

991
01:26:50,944 --> 01:26:53,196
looking for someone to love me.

992
01:26:54,364 --> 01:26:56,366
And now I love somebody.

993
01:26:57,992 --> 01:26:59,911
And it's so easy.

994
01:27:01,829 --> 01:27:03,623
Why is it easy now?

995
01:27:06,584 --> 01:27:07,960
I don't know.

996
01:27:08,878 --> 01:27:10,713
It is for me too.

997
01:27:12,548 --> 01:27:14,300
I love you, Jim.

998
01:27:15,092 --> 01:27:17,094
I really mean it.

999
01:27:20,389 --> 01:27:22,391
Well, I'm glad.

1000
01:27:58,718 --> 01:27:59,928
Good morning.

1001
01:28:15,276 --> 01:28:16,611
Let's take him!

1002
01:30:29,073 --> 01:30:30,032
That's it.

1003
01:30:30,741 --> 01:30:32,368
This is unit 17.

1004
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:36,914
We just zeroed gray Ford coupe, 1946.

1005
01:30:37,123 --> 01:30:41,627
Observatory Drive and Crest Place.
Looks like housebreaking.

1006
01:30:42,586 --> 01:30:45,089
Alert Juvenile and stand by to send help.

1007
01:31:10,655 --> 01:31:12,282
Save me!

1008
01:31:19,289 --> 01:31:20,623
Save me!

1009
01:31:35,137 --> 01:31:36,806
Plato, what's with...?

1010
01:31:40,059 --> 01:31:43,729
Why did you run out on me?
Why did you leave me alone?

1011
01:31:47,024 --> 01:31:48,609
What's the matter with you?

1012
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:51,487
I thought you were someone else!

1013
01:31:51,653 --> 01:31:53,322
Who? Plato, it's me! Look at me.

1014
01:31:53,655 --> 01:31:54,698
What's the matter?

1015
01:31:54,782 --> 01:31:57,242
Let me go! You're not my father!

1016
01:31:57,659 --> 01:31:59,328
You're not my father!

1017
01:32:08,003 --> 01:32:09,254
Halt!

1018
01:32:09,713 --> 01:32:11,006
Halt!

1019
01:32:13,174 --> 01:32:14,759
Come here, son.

1020
01:32:16,469 --> 01:32:17,637
Come here.

1021
01:32:18,054 --> 01:32:20,473
Walk over quietly. There won't be trouble.

1022
01:32:32,735 --> 01:32:34,529
Cover the house. I'll get him.

1023
01:32:52,046 --> 01:32:53,047
Halt!

1024
01:33:25,245 --> 01:33:26,704
- Did he hit you?
- I'm okay.

1025
01:33:26,788 --> 01:33:28,665
- Let's go back!
- I'm going after him.

1026
01:33:28,873 --> 01:33:32,085
- After he tried to shoot you?
- Stay down.

1027
01:33:32,293 --> 01:33:35,338
He didn't mean it.
We shouldn't have left him.

1028
01:33:35,838 --> 01:33:36,798
He needs us.

1029
01:33:36,881 --> 01:33:40,093
He needed you maybe, but so do I.

1030
01:33:40,343 --> 01:33:41,969
He needs you too.

1031
01:33:50,102 --> 01:33:51,312
You okay?

1032
01:33:54,857 --> 01:33:56,108
Come on.

1033
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:05,242
You should have heard him tonight.

1034
01:34:05,701 --> 01:34:08,287
He was talking about you...

1035
01:34:09,204 --> 01:34:11,790
like you were the hero in the China Sea.

1036
01:34:16,044 --> 01:34:17,546
You know what he wanted?

1037
01:34:18,922 --> 01:34:21,133
He tried to make us his family.

1038
01:34:22,134 --> 01:34:24,177
I guess he just wanted us to be like...

1039
01:34:25,387 --> 01:34:29,933
his...

1040
01:34:38,816 --> 01:34:39,943
Halt!

1041
01:34:43,321 --> 01:34:45,239
Jim, they're killing him!

1042
01:35:19,481 --> 01:35:20,899
Come out of there!

1043
01:35:21,316 --> 01:35:23,860
You're making it tough on yourself, kid.

1044
01:35:24,069 --> 01:35:27,030
Come quietly now.
You didn't kill anybody yet.

1045
01:35:59,228 --> 01:36:00,521
Need a little help here.

1046
01:36:00,605 --> 01:36:02,440
We heard firing. He hit anybody?

1047
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:03,899
- Are you alone?
- Yeah.

1048
01:36:04,150 --> 01:36:07,236
We got a kook inside with a gun.
He wounded some kid.

1049
01:36:07,611 --> 01:36:08,612
How'd he get in?

1050
01:36:08,696 --> 01:36:10,364
Smashed the front door.

1051
01:36:10,614 --> 01:36:13,242
- Is there another entrance?
- Down in back.

1052
01:36:14,326 --> 01:36:15,744
Seal him off.

1053
01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:24,753
I don't understand. I don't understand.

1054
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:26,922
You pray for your children.

1055
01:36:27,089 --> 01:36:31,093
You read about things like this
happening to other families...

1056
01:36:33,595 --> 01:36:36,097
but never dream it
could happen to yours.

1057
01:36:36,264 --> 01:36:37,390
The Observatory?

1058
01:36:38,099 --> 01:36:39,935
Five housebreaking in area.

1059
01:36:40,226 --> 01:36:42,395
Right. We'll proceed. Over.

1060
01:36:43,438 --> 01:36:45,648
There are some other kids in trouble.

1061
01:36:46,149 --> 01:36:47,650
You'll have to go with me.

1062
01:36:47,734 --> 01:36:50,278
Sure, sure. That's all right.

1063
01:36:55,742 --> 01:36:57,577
Lieutenant says seal them off.

1064
01:37:16,428 --> 01:37:17,805
Hello, Ray.

1065
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:19,723
You know anything about this?

1066
01:37:19,807 --> 01:37:21,058
No more than you do.

1067
01:37:21,141 --> 01:37:22,976
A kid's in there with a gun.

1068
01:37:23,143 --> 01:37:26,396
He wounded another kid
and shot at an officer.

1069
01:37:27,147 --> 01:37:29,983
- You got a speaker?
- Yeah, help yourself.

1070
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:36,406
- What's going on?
- Some kid's in trouble. Stay back.

1071
01:37:36,615 --> 01:37:39,826
I got to know! My boy ran off
and he got a gun too.

1072
01:37:40,035 --> 01:37:41,828
All right. Lieutenant!

1073
01:37:42,579 --> 01:37:44,956
I'm addressing the boy in the planetarium.

1074
01:37:45,165 --> 01:37:47,000
I'm speaking to the boy inside.

1075
01:37:47,792 --> 01:37:50,628
This is Ray Frameck
from the Juvenile Division.

1076
01:37:51,421 --> 01:37:53,465
Armed police are outside.

1077
01:37:53,923 --> 01:37:57,760
Whoever you are,
drop your weapon and come out.

1078
01:37:59,429 --> 01:38:01,014
Come outside!

1079
01:38:01,556 --> 01:38:06,018
Clasp your hands over your head
and come outside quietly.

1080
01:38:08,646 --> 01:38:09,647
Mr. Stark!

1081
01:38:10,022 --> 01:38:11,440
Frank!

1082
01:38:14,777 --> 01:38:16,278
That's my son.

1083
01:38:19,448 --> 01:38:20,574
Hold your fire!

1084
01:38:24,662 --> 01:38:25,913
Are you sure?

1085
01:38:26,288 --> 01:38:27,956
I think I know my son.

1086
01:38:32,169 --> 01:38:36,256
Officers, another boy and girl
just ran into the planetarium.

1087
01:38:36,465 --> 01:38:38,258
We don't know if they're armed.

1088
01:38:38,467 --> 01:38:41,595
Hold your positions
until further instructions.

1089
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:45,599
Another boy and girljust ran
into the planetarium.

1090
01:38:45,807 --> 01:38:47,809
We don't know if they're armed.

1091
01:38:48,059 --> 01:38:51,438
Hold your positions
until further instructions.

1092
01:38:53,189 --> 01:38:54,482
You in there?

1093
01:38:55,442 --> 01:38:57,736
You're my friend, Plato.

1094
01:38:58,862 --> 01:39:00,697
That means a lot to me.

1095
01:39:01,322 --> 01:39:04,158
Hey! I'm going to open the door now.

1096
01:39:15,336 --> 01:39:17,296
You can shoot me if you want to.

1097
01:39:25,262 --> 01:39:27,973
Boy, I'm blind as a bat.

1098
01:39:28,224 --> 01:39:29,767
You got a match?

1099
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:34,730
I'll break my neck in here.

1100
01:39:34,813 --> 01:39:36,273
Where are you?

1101
01:39:37,608 --> 01:39:39,193
I've got a gun.

1102
01:39:42,279 --> 01:39:43,655
Yeah, I know.

1103
01:39:47,367 --> 01:39:49,953
- Light a match, will you?
- No.

1104
01:39:53,248 --> 01:39:54,541
How are you?

1105
01:39:55,792 --> 01:39:57,377
I'm fine.

1106
01:39:57,586 --> 01:39:59,129
That's fine.

1107
01:40:08,304 --> 01:40:12,141
Do you think the end of the world
will come at nighttime?

1108
01:40:16,270 --> 01:40:17,647
At dawn.

1109
01:40:21,067 --> 01:40:22,818
Come on, now.

1110
01:40:25,446 --> 01:40:26,822
Where are you?

1111
01:40:34,163 --> 01:40:35,581
What are you hiding for?

1112
01:40:35,789 --> 01:40:37,291
Just stand up.

1113
01:40:38,167 --> 01:40:40,836
How can I talk to you if I can't see you?

1114
01:40:42,171 --> 01:40:44,506
I can't talk to you if I can't see you.

1115
01:40:45,674 --> 01:40:47,301
Come on, stand up.

1116
01:40:48,010 --> 01:40:51,221
You've seen this show before. Come on.

1117
01:40:53,181 --> 01:40:55,058
Do you see that star up there?

1118
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:58,437
Stand up. Look at it.

1119
01:41:00,605 --> 01:41:02,899
I can't talk to you if I can't see you.

1120
01:41:03,108 --> 01:41:04,609
That's all there is to it.

1121
01:41:15,870 --> 01:41:18,706
I'm not going to hurt you
or anything like that.

1122
01:41:26,255 --> 01:41:28,382
Why did you run out on me?

1123
01:41:30,551 --> 01:41:32,303
We didn't run out on you.

1124
01:41:33,179 --> 01:41:35,264
We were coming right back, I told you.

1125
01:41:35,473 --> 01:41:36,932
You sure?

1126
01:41:38,017 --> 01:41:39,852
Sure, I'm sure.

1127
01:41:41,770 --> 01:41:43,188
Judy's here.

1128
01:41:44,023 --> 01:41:46,150
She's waiting. Come on.

1129
01:41:47,443 --> 01:41:48,402
Come on.

1130
01:41:51,738 --> 01:41:53,824
No? Not ready to come out yet?

1131
01:42:02,582 --> 01:42:04,751
Promise you, nothing will happen.

1132
01:42:08,171 --> 01:42:09,589
Are you cold?

1133
01:42:10,465 --> 01:42:11,466
Here.

1134
01:42:14,928 --> 01:42:16,679
It's warm. Here.

1135
01:42:17,597 --> 01:42:19,557
My jacket. It's warm.

1136
01:42:21,559 --> 01:42:23,061
Can I keep it?

1137
01:42:23,269 --> 01:42:24,937
Well, what do you think?

1138
01:42:30,151 --> 01:42:32,778
Hey, now can I have the gun, Plato?

1139
01:42:32,945 --> 01:42:34,614
You want to give it to me?

1140
01:42:36,616 --> 01:42:38,868
- My gun?
- Yeah. In your pocket.

1141
01:42:39,076 --> 01:42:40,411
Give it to me.

1142
01:42:50,462 --> 01:42:52,131
No, I need it.

1143
01:42:56,301 --> 01:42:58,303
Don't you trust me, Plato?

1144
01:43:00,597 --> 01:43:02,307
Just give it to me for a second.

1145
01:43:11,983 --> 01:43:14,277
Been carrying this around all day?

1146
01:43:22,494 --> 01:43:23,953
Now there's a...

1147
01:43:25,955 --> 01:43:27,832
lot of people out front.

1148
01:43:30,335 --> 01:43:32,295
You promised to give it back.

1149
01:43:34,255 --> 01:43:36,507
Friends always keep their promises.

1150
01:43:41,262 --> 01:43:42,763
These people...

1151
01:43:44,515 --> 01:43:48,644
You know, every one
of them want to see that you're safe.

1152
01:43:48,936 --> 01:43:50,646
You understand that?

1153
01:43:51,188 --> 01:43:52,982
They want you to be safe.

1154
01:43:55,192 --> 01:43:56,986
And... Oh, here.

1155
01:43:57,444 --> 01:43:59,488
They said I could come in here...

1156
01:43:59,697 --> 01:44:01,657
and I could bring you out, and...

1157
01:44:01,865 --> 01:44:02,950
Why?

1158
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:05,828
Why?

1159
01:44:06,870 --> 01:44:08,455
Because they like you.

1160
01:44:12,709 --> 01:44:13,877
Come on.

1161
01:44:32,061 --> 01:44:33,563
It's too bright.

1162
01:44:38,985 --> 01:44:40,361
I'll fix it.

1163
01:44:54,083 --> 01:44:56,585
Is Ray Frameck still out there?

1164
01:44:57,962 --> 01:44:59,171
Yes, I'm here.

1165
01:45:00,798 --> 01:45:02,925
Hey, turn out those lights!

1166
01:45:03,425 --> 01:45:05,260
If you do, we'll come out!

1167
01:45:06,428 --> 01:45:07,930
Turn your lights out.

1168
01:45:16,271 --> 01:45:18,106
See? Come on.

1169
01:45:29,701 --> 01:45:30,577
Who's that?

1170
01:45:31,953 --> 01:45:34,080
- Just a guy.
- I shot at one of them.

1171
01:45:34,289 --> 01:45:36,416
It's all right. You didn't hurt him.

1172
01:45:36,624 --> 01:45:38,543
Those are not my friends!

1173
01:45:39,377 --> 01:45:41,129
Make them go away.

1174
01:45:43,631 --> 01:45:47,927
You want me to make them go away?
You want me to fix it? Okay.

1175
01:45:53,474 --> 01:45:56,060
Ray, can you make those guys get back?

1176
01:45:56,268 --> 01:45:59,063
You don't have to worry
about anything. Here.

1177
01:45:59,271 --> 01:46:00,898
Keep the guys back.

1178
01:46:02,066 --> 01:46:04,151
That other kid still has a gun.

1179
01:46:08,155 --> 01:46:10,491
Don't turn on the lights! It's too bright.

1180
01:46:10,658 --> 01:46:13,285
Plato doesn't... Turn out the lights!

1181
01:46:26,339 --> 01:46:28,300
I got the bullets!

1182
01:46:28,967 --> 01:46:30,510
Look!

1183
01:46:35,056 --> 01:46:36,099
Let him alone!

1184
01:46:36,308 --> 01:46:38,601
Who are you? What do you want?

1185
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:41,271
All right, fellas. All right, Lieutenant.

1186
01:46:44,065 --> 01:46:45,650
Get the stretcher in here.

1187
01:46:46,067 --> 01:46:47,527
For a minute there, I...

1188
01:46:48,152 --> 01:46:50,363
When I saw that red jacket, I...

1189
01:46:50,571 --> 01:46:51,823
I thought...

1190
01:47:02,083 --> 01:47:03,918
Hey, jerkpot...

1191
01:47:05,586 --> 01:47:07,296
what'd you do that for?

1192
01:47:15,429 --> 01:47:17,222
You can't help it, son.

1193
01:47:17,723 --> 01:47:20,100
You did everything a man could.

1194
01:47:44,624 --> 01:47:46,418
Help me.

1195
01:47:49,838 --> 01:47:51,839
You can depend on me.

1196
01:47:52,048 --> 01:47:53,633
Trust me.

1197
01:47:54,926 --> 01:47:58,179
Whatever comes, we'll face it together.

1198
01:47:58,513 --> 01:48:00,014
I swear it.

1199
01:48:02,350 --> 01:48:03,559
Now, Jim...

1200
01:48:03,935 --> 01:48:05,269
stand up.

1201
01:48:06,938 --> 01:48:08,773
I'll stand up with you.

1202
01:48:09,315 --> 01:48:13,110
I'll try and be as strong
as you want me to be. Come on.

1203
01:48:44,933 --> 01:48:49,020
This poor baby got nobody. Just nobody!

1204
01:49:18,466 --> 01:49:20,468
He was always cold.

1205
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:40,445
This is Judy.

1206
01:49:41,029 --> 01:49:42,197
She's my friend.

1207
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:03,635
He's...
